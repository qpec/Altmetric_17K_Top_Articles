Introduction
HIV relentlessly destroys CD4+ T cells in the course of infec-
tion and causes functional impairment in the remaining CD4+ 
T cell population. This leads to the progressive loss of adaptive 
responses to opportunistic pathogens and ultimately to the col-
lapse of the immune system characteristic of AIDS. Chronic 
immune activation is thought to drive dysfunction of the remain-
ing CD4+ T cell population, with both persistent viral antigenic 
stimulation and microbial translocation conspiring to exhaust 
T cell responses (1). Another parameter contributing to the loss 
of helper function may be the poor quality of CD4+ T cells that 
escape depletion. Early studies of the repertoire of T cell recep-
tors (TCRs) documented a general loss of CD4+ T cell diversity 
in HIV-infected patients (2, 3), while further studies highlighted 
a preferential depletion of HIV-specific CD4+ T cells (4–6), sug-
gesting that the HIV-specific repertoire was especially prone to 
diversity contraction. To date, the HIV-specific CD4 repertoire 
remains mostly uncharacterized at the molecular level, even 
though this information would be critical to define the potential 
for immune reconstitution in treated patients.
Rare cases of spontaneously controlled HIV-1 infection pro-
vide a unique opportunity to study the molecular characteris-
tics of a fully functional CD4+ T cell response directed at HIV. 
Patients who maintain an undetectable viral load in standard 
assays (<50 copies of HIV-1 RNA/ml) represent fewer than 0.5% 
of seropositive individuals but have a remarkably low risk of pro-
gressing to AIDS (7). These rare patients, called HIV controllers, 
or alternatively elite controllers, show signs of particularly effi-
cient cellular responses that actively control the infected cell pop-
ulation (8). Controller CD8+ T cells have the capacity to potently 
inhibit HIV replication when added to cultures of infected autolo-
gous CD4+ T cells and are thought to play a key role in HIV control 
(9, 10). Recent evidence suggest that particular TCR clonotypes 
expressed by controller CD8+ T cells are responsible for their effi-
cient cytotoxic responses, while HLA-matched non-controller 
patients show clonotypes of lower efficacy (11–13). In addition, 
clonotypes from controllers are able to maintain cross-recogni-
tion of dominant epitope variants, thus preventing the emergence 
of viral escape mutants (11, 12, 14).
The role of the CD4 response in HIV control remains less 
completely understood. Controllers maintain a population of 
The rare patients who are able to spontaneously control HIV replication in the absence of therapy show signs of a particularly 
efficient cellular immune response. To identify the molecular determinants that underlie this response, we characterized 
the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire directed at Gag293, the most immunoprevalent CD4 epitope in the HIV-1 capsid. HIV 
controllers from the ANRS CODEX cohort showed a highly skewed TCR repertoire that was characterized by a predominance of 
TRAV24 and TRBV2 variable genes, shared CDR3 motifs, and a high frequency of public clonotypes. The most prevalent public 
clonotypes generated TCRs with affinities at the higher end of values reported for naturally occurring TCRs. The high-affinity 
Gag293-specific TCRs were cross-restricted by up to 5 distinct HLA-DR alleles, accounting for the expression of these TCRs in 
HIV controllers of diverse genetic backgrounds. Transfer of these TCRs to healthy donor CD4+ T cells conferred high antigen 
sensitivity and polyfunctionality, thus recapitulating key features of the controller CD4 response. Transfer of a high-affinity 
Gag293-specific TCR also redirected CD8+ T cells to target HIV-1 capsid via nonconventional MHC II restriction. Together, these 
findings indicate that TCR clonotypes with superior functions are associated with HIV control. Amplification or transfer of 
such clonotypes may contribute to immunotherapeutic approaches aiming at a functional HIV cure.

Results
We set out to compare Gag293-specific CD4 responses in HIV 
controllers and efficiently treated patients, two groups character-
ized by long-term viral control. The clinical and immunological 
characteristics of the studied patients are reported in Table 1. A 
stringent definition of HIV control was applied, based on an unde-
tectable viral load in standard assays (<50 copies HIV-1 RNA/
ml) for more than 5 years. The duration of control was actually 
longer, as patients included in the controller group (HIC group, 
 
n = 14) had been infected for a median duration of 19.6 years. They 
were compared with HIV-1–infected patients who had received 
long-term antiretroviral therapy (HAART group, n = 15), with an 
undetectable viral load for at least 5 years and a median duration 
of treatment of 11.9 years. Thus, both groups were characterized 
by long-term viral suppression, which ensured that potential dif-
ferences in CD4 responses were not primarily determined by lev-
els of residual HIV viremia.
High antigen sensitivity of Gag293-specific CD4 responses in 
HIV controllers. TCR repertoire studies of specific CD4+ T cells 
have remained scarce in humans due to the limited clonal ampli-
fication of CD4+ T cells as compared with CD8+ T cells, and to 
the generally lower affinity of TCRs expressed by CD4+ T cells, 
which limits MHC II tetramer detection (29). In the case of HIV 
infection, these factors are compounded by the general decrease 
in the CD4+ T cell population and the preferential depletion of 
HIV-specific CD4+ T cells (5, 6). To address these issues, we 
devised a system of short-term primary CD4+ T cell line cultures 
that allowed the amplification of MHC II tetramer–positive cells 
prior to sorting. Using this system, we previously reported the 
presence Gag293-specific CD4+ T cells with high antigen sensi-
tivity and high MHC II tetramer binding capacity in controllers, 
while such cells were absent in treated patients (25). To extend 
these results, we generated primary CD4+ T cell lines by stimula-
tion with decreasing doses of Gag293 peptide. The specificity of 
CD4+ T cell lines was evaluated at equivalent growth stages (dou-
bling time), by restimulation with Gag293 and analysis by IFN-γ 
ELISPOT assay. As reported in Table 1, viable Gag293-specific cell 
lines were obtained for all patients of the HIC and HAART groups 
when initially stimulated with the highest peptide dose of 10–5 M. 
However, a marked difference was observed for cell lines gener-
ated at 10–7 M peptide, with only 8 of 15 treated patients respond-
ing versus all of the 14 controllers (P = 0.006). The difference was 
also marked at the 10–9 M peptide dose (P = 0.005). Moreover, 
two of the controllers, but none of the treated patients, responded 
at the 10–11 M peptide dose. These experiments established that 
Gag293-specific CD4+ T cells had a higher antigen sensitivity in 
the controller group, as indicated by the capacity to proliferate and 
differentiate into IFN-γ–secreting effectors upon stimulation with 
minimal peptide doses.
Biased TRAV and TRBV gene usage in Gag293-specific CD4+ 
 
T cells. To characterize the Gag93-specific TCR repertoire, we first 
genotyped patients for the HLA-DRB1 gene. Eight controllers and 
8 treated patients who shared at least 1 of 4 HLA-DR alleles (DR1, 
DR11, DR15, or DRB5) were included in the TCR study (Supplemen-
tal Table 1; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI83792DS1). The frequencies of these 4 alleles did 
not differ significantly between the HIC and the HAART groups 
 
HIV-specific central memory (CM) CD4+ T cells endowed with a 
strong proliferative capacity, which has been linked to autocrine 
IL-2 production and the upregulation of antiapoptotic molecules 
(15–18). However, the presence of long-lived CM cells does not 
appear sufficient to ensure HIV control, as patients treated early 
in the course of primary HIV infection also maintain specific 
CM CD4+ T cells with strong proliferative capacity, but in most 
cases fail to control HIV replication upon treatment interruption 
(19). Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the antiviral CD4 
response in controllers is qualitatively different from that in effi-
ciently treated patients, and is not just a consequence of a very 
low viremia. In particular, controller CD4+ T cells preferentially 
target Gag rather than Env epitopes, suggesting differences in 
the repertoire of specific CD4+ T cells (20). Controller CD4+ T 
cells are also more polyfunctional, as indicated by the capacity to 
produce multiple cytokines and chemokines simultaneously (21). 
A key difference lies in the persistence of specific CD4+ T cells 
with an effector differentiation status, even though the amount 
of HIV antigens available to drive these responses is minimal. We 
reported that Gag-specific CD4+ T cells in controllers maintain 
a Th1 effector profile with IFN-γ production and degranulation 
capacity, while such effectors disappear in patients treated in the 
long term (22). Controller CD4+ T cells express low levels of nega-
tive costimulatory molecules such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, compat-
ible with preserved effector functions (23, 24). Taken together, 
these findings suggest that Th1 effectors escape depletion and 
retain optimal functions to sustain the antiviral response in con-
trolled HIV infection.
An explanation for the remarkable properties of HIV-specific 
CD4 responses in controllers may lie in the nature of the TCRs 
that mediate these responses. We previously identified a popula-
tion of CD4+ T cells with a high antigen sensitivity to immuno-
prevalent Gag peptides in HIV controllers, while this population 
was absent in treated patients (25). The sensitive detection of 
Gag antigens depended on intrinsic differences in the set of TCRs 
expressed by controller CD4+ T cells, as indicated by a high TCR 
avidity measured in MHC II tetramer dilution assays. High TCR 
avidity is a hallmark of viral control in several models of chronic 
viral infections (26) and has been associated with antiviral effi-
cacy in HIV-specific CD8+ T cells (10, 13, 27). In contrast, there 
are limited data available on the impact of TCR avidity on human 
CD4+ T cell antiviral responses. We reasoned that the presence 
of high-avidity TCRs may explain why controllers maintained 
HIV-specific CD4+ T cells with an effector differentiation sta-
tus in spite of their very low viremia, and we set to characterize 
these TCRs at the molecular and functional level. The study was 
focused on TCRs specific for the most immunoprevalent CD4 
epitope in Gag, located at position 293–312 in the capsid major 
homology region (MHR). This epitope, designated Gag293, is 
exceptionally immunoprevalent, as it induces an IFN-γ ELISPOT 
response in close to half of HIV-1–infected patients irrespective 
of genetic background (20, 28) and gives a greater than 70% 
response rate in controllers of the Agence nationale de recherches 
sur le SIDA et les hépatites virales (ANRS) CO21 CODEX cohort 
(25). We could thus compare the repertoire of Gag293-specific 
clonotypes in patients of varied HLA backgrounds who controlled 
HIV infection either naturally or through antiretroviral therapy.

ily also appeared amplified at high levels in some of 
the treated patient samples (median, 28%), with a 
difference between the HIC and HAART groups 
that did not reach significance (P = 0.13; Figure 
1C). In comparison, T cells from healthy donors 
expressed TRBV2 at low levels (3.7% ± 1.0%; data 
not shown). CDR3 length distribution appeared 
more variable for the TRBV2 than the TRAV24 
chain (Figure 1E), though a trend toward a predomi-
nant CDR3 of 13 aa was apparent in controllers’ Tet+ 
cells. Taken together, these data provide evidence 
for a highly skewed Gag293-specific TCR reper-
toire characterized by the preferential usage of the 
TRAV24 and TRBV2 variable gene segments. The 
fact that the bias is more marked in Gag293-specific 
cells from controllers than treated patients suggests 
a contribution of the TRAV24 and TRBV2 variable 
regions to the high-avidity recognition of Gag293.
High clonotypic diversity of Gag293-specific cells 
in controllers. Clonotypic repertoire analysis was 
carried out for the two variable gene families ampli-
fied in Gag293-specific cells, TRAV24 and TRBV2. 
PCR products corresponding to these two families were cloned, 
sequenced, and analyzed with IMGT tools (32). A minimum of 
50 productive CDR3 sequences were analyzed for each sample 
(a full list of CDR3 sequences is provided in Supplemental Tables 
2 and 3). Productive TRAV24 sequences (HIC: n = 584; HAART: 
n = 496) were evaluated for diversity by counting the distinct 
clonotypes, i.e., the number of unique CDR3 aa sequences, pres-
ent in each patient sample. The normalized number of clonotypes 
proved significantly higher in the HIC than the HAART group 
(P = 0.0011; Figure 2A). Similarly, analysis of TRBV2 sequences 
(HIC: n = 716; HAART: n = 566) showed higher clonotypic diver-
sity in HIC samples (P = 0.0047; Figure 2A). Of note, the number 
of TRBV2 clonotypes per 100 sequences was remarkably high in 
the HIC group (median, 36), indicating the presence of a diverse 
TCR repertoire in spite of the pronounced bias for TRBV2. Com-
putation of Simpson’s diversity index confirmed a trend for higher 
clonotypic diversity in the HIC group, which reached significance 
for TRAV24 but not TRBV2 sequences (Figure 2B). The number 
of mutations needed to generate the observed CDR3 sequences 
from their germline counterparts was also significantly higher in 
the HIC group, for both the TRAV24 and TRBV2 datasets (Supple-
mental Figure 4, A and B). Thus, both the number of clonotypes 
and the number of CDR3 insertions and deletions were consistent 
with the persistence of a more diverse Gag293-specific repertoire 
in controlled HIV infection.
Biased J and D gene usage in Gag293-specific TCRs from control-
lers. The Gag293-specific CDR3 sequence dataset was analyzed 
for the distribution of junction (J) and diversity (D) gene segments. 
TRAJ gene usage was restricted, with 15 and 11 distinct TRAJ genes 
detected in TRAV24 sequences for the HIC and HAART groups, 
respectively, of 61 TRAJ genes reported in the IMGT database 
(Figure 2C). The TRAJ17 gene predominated in the HIC group 
(48%), while the next most abundant genes, TRAJ39 and TRAJ32, 
were present at 16% and 12%, respectively. TRAJ gene usage in the 
HAART group appeared more evenly distributed among TRAJ17 
(P ≥ 0.05 by Fisher’s exact test). CD4+ T cell lines from these patients 
were labeled with HLA-DR–matched Gag293-loaded tetramers 
and evaluated for the proportion of Tet+ cells in the CD4+CD8– 
 
T cell population (Figure 1A). Samples labeled with matched 
tetramers loaded with an irrelevant peptide (CLIP or Annexin II) 
were used as negative controls. The purity of the Tet+ population 
was controlled after sorting, as shown in representative examples 
(Figure 1A, right). TCR diversity of the sorted cells was evaluated 
through CDR3 length polymorphism analysis, using the immuno-
scope technique (30, 31). TCRα variable gene (TRAV) expression in 
controller Tet+ cells proved highly skewed, with a median of 44% of 
Gag293-specific cells expressing the TRAV24 gene family (Figure 
1B), while this family was amplified at lower levels in specific cells 
of treated patients (median, 13%; P = 0.037). In comparison, the 
TRAV24 family represented 1% ± 0.2% of T cells in a control group 
of 7 healthy donors (data not shown). Analysis of CDR3 length dis-
tribution showed a Gaussian pattern for control peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as expected (Figure 1D). In contrast, 
Gag293-specific cells appeared oligoclonal, with a dominant peak 
corresponding to a CDR3 of 10 aa, according to the numbering 
scheme of the International ImMunoGeneTics Information Sys-
tem (IMGT) (32). This peak was more prominent in cell lines from 
controllers than those from treated patients, suggesting a stronger 
TCR bias in controlled HIV infection.
Analysis of TCRβ variable gene (TRBV) distribution also 
revealed a major bias in Gag293-specific cells, with a marked pre-
dominance of the TRBV2 family, expressed at a median value of 
82% in the controller group (Figure 1C). TRBV2 was amplified in 
Tet+ cells of 7 of 8 controllers in the present study, while this ampli-
fication was seen in only 1 of 4 controllers in a first study, where 
we tested Gag293-specific TCR profiles with a panel of Vβ-specific 
antibodies (25). The lower frequency of TRBV2 (previously desig-
nated Vβ22) amplification detected in the initial study may have 
resulted from suboptimal Vβ antibody binding due to competition 
with the MHC II tetramer for binding to the TCR. The TRBV2 fam-

and TRBD2, as well as narrowly distributed CDR3 lengths; in con-
trast sequences from treated patients appeared more heteroge-
neous. Thus, controller TCRs showed restricted V(D)J gene usage, 
indicative of a repertoire shaped under strong selective pressure, 
while maintaining a high clonotypic diversity.
High prevalence of public motifs in Gag293-specific TCRs from 
controllers. Given the observed biases in V(D)J gene usage, we 
next evaluated whether Gag293-specific CDR3 sequences shared 
common aa motifs. The MEME motif discovery software (http:/
/
meme-suite.org/) was used in discriminative mode to iden-
tify motifs enriched in HIC as compared with HAART TRAV24 
sequences. This approach revealed a highly prevalent but com-
plex motif shared by 81% of HIC CDR3 sequences (Figure 3A). 
Comparison of the predominant motif in the HIC and HAART 
datasets highlighted that sequence differences mostly concen-
trated in the N-terminal part of the CDR3 (Supplemental Fig-
(29%), TRAJ39 (21%), and TRAJ38 (13%). Analysis of the TRBJ dis-
tribution in TRBV2 sequences showed again a more biased reper-
toire in the HIC group, with a predominant TRBJ2-1 gene present 
in 43% of sequences, while the most abundant TRBJ gene in the 
HAART group, TRBJ1-2, represented only 22% of sequences (Fig-
ure 2D). Of note, TRBJ1-2 was only minimally represented in HIC 
sequences (4%), emphasizing differences between the HIC and 
HAART Gag293-specific repertoires. In addition, the TRBD2 gene 
segment was more prevalent in HIC sequences, while the two TRBD 
genes were equally represented in HAART sequences (Figure 2E). 
CDR3 lengths in the HIC group showed a marked peak at 10 and 13 
aa for the TRAV24 and TRBV2 sequence sets, respectively, while 
CDR3 lengths were more evenly distributed in the HAART group 
(Supplemental Figure 4, C and D). These analyses indicated that 
Gag293-specific CDR3 sequences from controllers were biased in 
genetic composition, with a predominant use of TRAJ17, TRBJ2-1,

ure 5A). More detailed analyses identified two simpler motifs of 
10 and 11 aa that were significantly more prevalent in HIC than 
HAART CDR3 sequences (Table 2). CDR3α motif AV24-1 ([A/S]
x[K/R]AAGNKLT; with x denoting any aa) encompassed the 
highly conserved AGNKLT sequence derived from the TRAJ17 
gene, while motif AV24-2 (AxYGGATNKLI) contained a related 
ATNKLI sequence derived from the TRAJ32 gene. Taken together, 
these two motifs were found in 49% of HIC versus 29% of HAART 
TRAV24 sequences (P < 0.0001).
MEME analysis of TRBV2 sequences in discriminative mode 
identified a complex motif with interspersed highly conserved 
positions in 79% of HIC sequences (Figure 3B). A predominant 
motif was apparent in HIC TRBV2 sequences, while HAART 
TRBV2 sequences appeared too diverse for motif identification 
(Supplemental Figure 5B). Further analyses of HIC sequences 
revealed the overlap of two simpler motifs of 13 and 14 aa, respec-
tively (Table 2). CDR3β motifs BV2-1 (ASSx[R/G/L][T/A][S/G]
Gxx[E/T]Q[F
/Y]) and BV2-2 (ASSx[R/G/L][T/A]SGGxx[E/T]
Q[F
/Y]) were highly similar and differed only by the presence of 
an additional G in the latter. Taken together, these two motifs were 
found in 50% of HIC versus 10% of HAART TRBV2 sequences 
(P < 0.0001), indicating a predominance of conserved CDR3 res-
idues in HIC clonotypes. This bias suggested a requirement of 
particular CDR3 residues for efficient recognition of the Gag293–
MHC II complex. It was noteworthy that half of the TRAV24 and 
TRBV2 clonotypes identified in the HIC group shared the identi-
fied public motifs, indicative of a highly constrained Gag293-spe-
cific repertoire in controlled HIV infection.
High frequency of TCR sharing in HIV controllers. Public clono-
types were defined as identical CDR3 aa sequences found in at 
least two individuals, without any mismatch tolerated. A total of 18 
public clonotypes were identified in the TRAV24 sequence data-
set obtained from the 16 patients studied (Supplemental Figure 
6A). The most prevalent public clonotype, AFKAAGNKLT (called 
TRAV24-F), was found in 6 controllers and 2 treated patients (75% 
and 25%, respectively), which are remarkably high frequencies 
in humans with diverse HLA II backgrounds. Groups of highly 
related public clonotypes were apparent, with a first group sharing

to identify aa motifs enriched in controller TRAV24 sequences (A) and TRBV2 sequences (B) compared with corresponding sequences in treated patients.

the TRAJ17 chain and motif AxKAAGNKLT (AV24-1), and a sec-
ond group sharing the TRAJ32 chain and motif AxYGGATNKLI 
(AV24-2). The 18 public clonotypes showed a high degree of motif 
sharing (61% positive for motifs AV24-1 or AV24-2, Table 2), con-
firming their similarity. Of note, public clonotypes were more fre-
quent in the HIC than in the HAART group (P = 0.03; Figure 3C). 
Counting the nucleotide sequences encoding public clonotypes, 
normalized to 100 sequences, confirmed the higher frequency of 
TCR sharing in the HIC group (P = 0.01; Figure 3E).
Interestingly, the majority of TRAV24 public clonotypes (67%) 
were encoded by multiple nucleotide sequences. The mean num-
ber of unique nucleotide sequences encoding a TRAV24 pub-
lic clonotype was 2.33, versus 1.05 for private (i.e., non-public) 
TRAV24 clonotypes. Detailed analysis of the 4 sequences coding 
for the most prevalent TRAV24 public clonotype, AFKAAGNKLT, 
showed that P and N mutations inserted between the TRAV24 and 
the TRAJ17 genes were few, ranging from 0 to 4 nucleotides (Sup-
plemental Table 7). The numbers of nucleotides trimmed from 
germline sequences were also in the low range (6 to 10) compared 
with the ensemble of HIC sequences (mean of 9.9 trimmed nucle-
otides). The two predominant sequences, representing 64.9% and 
33.8% of AFKAAGNKLT coding sequences, respectively, contained 
no mutation and were simply obtained by trimming 6 nucleotides 
from joined TRAV24-TRAJ17 genes. Thus, the most prevalent 
TRAV24 public clonotype could be easily generated from germline 
sequences, suggestive of convergent V(D)J recombination (33).
Public clonotypes were also abundant in Gag293-specific TCRβ 
chains, with a total of 18 found in the TRBV2 sequence dataset (Sup-
plemental Figure 6B). Public clonotype sequences derived predom-
inantly from the TRBJ2-3, TRBJ2-1, and TRBJ2-7 genes, which were 
all represented to a higher degree in HIC than HAART sequences. 
TRBV2 public clonotypes showed a remarkably high degree of motif 
sharing (83%, Table 2), emphasizing the presence of conserved fea-
tures in spite of relatively high sequence diversity. Again, TRBV2 
public clonotypes were clearly more frequent in the HIC than the 
HAART group, in terms of aa sequences (P = 0.006; Figure 3D) and 
of nucleotide sequences (P = 0.009; Figure 3F). The most frequent 
public clonotype, ASSRRTSGGTDTQY (called TRBV2-13), was 
found in 4 of 8 controllers (50%) and absent in treated patients. The 
majority of TRBV2 public clonotypes (77%) were encoded by more 
than one nucleotide sequence. The mean number of unique nucle-
otide sequences encoding a TRBV2 public clonotype was 2.28, 
versus 1.10 for private TRBV2 clonotypes, again suggesting that 
convergent V(D)J recombination contributes to the amplification of 
public clonotypes. Taken together, TRAV24 and TRBV2 sequence 
analyses revealed a highly biased Gag293-specific TCR repertoire, 
characterized by a high degree of TCR sharing in the controller 
group. TCR biases were of type III (identical CDR3 sequences) but 
also of type II (conserved CDR3 motifs) (34, 35), and characterized 
a substantial fraction of both TCR chains.
It was noteworthy that the majority of public clonotypes 
were restricted by multiple HLA-DR alleles. Specifically, 83% of 
TRAV24 public clonotypes and 56% of TRBV2 public clonotypes 
were identified in samples sorted with at least two different HLA-
DR tetramers (Supplemental Figure 6, A and B). The most prev-
alent TRAV24 public clonotype, TRAV24-F, was restricted by the 
4 HLA-DR alleles tested (DR1, DR11, DR15, and DRB5), while the 
most prevalent TRBV2 public clonotype, TRBV2-13, was restricted 
by 3 of these alleles (DR1, DR15, and DRB5). Thus, highly preva-
lent public clonotypes showed a high level of HLA cross-restric-
tion, which could help explain their prevalence in patients of 
diverse genetic backgrounds. Of note, public clonotypes were also 
frequently restricted by two distinct HLA-DR alleles within the 
same patient (Supplemental Tables 8 and 9), which could contrib-
ute to the induction of a more sensitive Gag293-specific response.
Ex vivo detection of Gag293-specific public clonotypes in HIV 
controllers. The Gag293-specific TCR repertoire was initially ana-
lyzed in primary CD4+ T cell lines, as the preferential depletion 
of specific CD4+ T cells in HIV-infected patients did not allow 
a direct ex vivo analysis of Tet+ cells. However, the exceptional 
immunological status of HIV controllers made the ex vivo anal-
ysis feasible for a subset of these patients. Four samples sorted 
from controller PBMCs containing more than 2,000 Tet+ cells 
were analyzed by immunoscope and sequencing. The DRB5 
tetramer was used in these experiments, as it yielded the best sig-
nal/noise ratio (example in Figure 4A). Quantification of TRAV24 
expression showed an amplification of this family in 3 of 4 HIC 
samples obtained ex vivo, as compared with the percentage of 
TRAV24 detected in PBMCs from 7 healthy donors (1.0% ± 0.2%) 
(Figure 4B). Quantification of TRBV2 showed an amplification in

suggested that public clonotypes could shape the properties of the 
Gag-specific response in controlled HIV infection.
TCR transfer confers Gag293 recognition in the context of multi-
ple HLA-DR alleles. We set out to functionally characterize the most 
prevalent TRAV24 public clonotype, AFKAAGNKLT (clonotype 
TRAV24-F), by pairing it with different TRBV2 chains and testing 
the activity of reconstituted TCRs. The chosen TRBV2 clonotypes, 
no. 24 (CASSRLAGGMDEQFF) and no. 25 (CATTPGASGISEQFF), 
were the most abundant in the cell line of patient HIC2 (10.38% 
and 33.96% of TRBV2 chains, respectively; Supplemental Table 
3), and were coexpressed at high levels with clonotype TRAV24-F, 
resulting in a high probability of functional TCR chain pairing. 
The third TRBV2 clonotype, no. 5 (CASSGLAGGMDEQFF), was 
derived from patient HIC3, who also expressed TRAV24-F at a high 
level. Clonotype 5 differed by a single residue (R to G) from clono-
type 24 and thus provided information on the contribution of the 
CDR3β arginine to TCR function. TRBV2 clonotypes 24 and 5 car-
ried the public motif BV2-1, while TRBV2 clonotype 25 was private 
(see Supplemental Table 11 for a list of all TCR constructs). Full-
length TRA and TRB genes were cloned into a T2A-containing len-
tiviral vector, ensuring equimolar expression of the two chains. The 
resulting TCRs, F24, F25, and F5, were transduced in J76, a mutant 
Jurkat cell line defective for endogenous TCR expression, which 
provides a favorable cellular context for TCR transfer assays. After 
transduction, J76 cells expressed equivalent levels of the 3 TCRs 
at the cell surface (≥60% TCR+ cells) and recovered a high level of 
CD3 surface expression (Figure 5A).
To test the specificity of the transferred TCRs, we labeled 
transduced J76 cells with a panel of Gag293-loaded HLA-DR 
tetramers. The F24 TCR was found to bind 3 of the 4 tetramers 
4 of 4 HIC samples obtained ex vivo, as compared with PBMCs 
from healthy donors (3.7 ± 1.0%) (Figure 4B).
The frequency of each TRAV24 clonotype found ex vivo was 
computed relative to total TRAV24 sequences found in the same 
patient (Supplemental Table 10, third column) and in the matched 
cell line (fourth column). Ex vivo clonotypes represented a median 
of 66% of sequences found in matched cell lines, indicating a sub-
stantial overlap between the ex vivo and in vitro repertoires (Fig-
ure 4C). Similarly, the TRBV2 clonotypes detected ex vivo (Sup-
plemental Table 3) represented a median of 45% of sequences 
found in matched cell lines (Figure 4C). Importantly, the fre-
quency of TRAV24 public motifs (AV24-1 + AV24-2) did not dif-
fer significantly between ex vivo and cell line–derived sequences, 
and could be as high as 87% (Figure 4D). Frequencies of TRBV2 
public motifs (BV2-1 + BV2-2) were also comparable ex vivo and 
in matched cell lines (Figure 4E). Public motifs were present at 
median values of 44% and 48% in the ex vivo TRAV24 and TRBV2 
sequence datasets, respectively, emphasizing the high level of 
motif sharing in the Gag293-specific repertoire.
Detailed analysis of TRAV24 sequences obtained ex vivo 
revealed the presence of previously identified public clonotypes in 
each of the patient tested (highlighted in color, Supplemental Table 
10). Public clonotypes were present at median frequencies of 44% 
and 25% in ex vivo TRAV24 and TRBV2 sequences, respectively, 
which did not differ significantly from frequencies observed in 
matched cell lines (data not shown). Overall, the ex vivo analysis 
confirmed the high degree of TCR sharing among HIV controllers. 
It was striking that some of the most prevalent public clonotypes, 
such as AFKAAGNKLT, could represent more than half of TRAV24 
sequences in the Gag293-specific repertoire (54.7% in HIC7). This

while binding was weak for F25 (1.5%) and undetectable for F5. 
Binding with the DR1 tetramer showed a similar pattern. The DR4 
tetramer provided a negative control, as it did not bind any of the 
TCRs tested. These experiments indicated that the highly preva-
lent public clonotype TRAV24-F could confer Gag293 recognition 
in the context of multiple HLA-DR molecules, with an efficiency 
tested, with an efficiency that was higher for DR11 as compared 
with DRB5 and DR1 (Figure 5B). Quantification of tetramer bind-
ing (Figure 5C) showed that the 3 TCRs recognized Gag293 in 
the context of DR11, with a labeling that was strong for F24 (72% 
Tet+), intermediate for F25 (44% Tet+), and low for F5 (3% Tet+). 
F24 bound the DRB5 tetramer at intermediate levels (33% Tet+),

ence of DR7 APCs (Supplemental Table 11). When restricted by 
DR11, F24 antigen sensitivity reached 4 × 10–7 M as measured by 
the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) for CD69 induc-
tion, which represents a high sensitivity for a cell culture system 
devoid of costimulatory molecules. The F25 TCR did not react with 
DR7 and showed intermediate reactivity with the other 4 HLA-
DR alleles. The F5 TCR showed the narrowest restriction, with an 
antigen sensitivity of 2 × 10–6 M in the presence of DR11 APCs, low 
responses in the presence of DR15 and DRB5 APCs, and undetect-
able responses in other cases. TCR affinities measured by SPR for 
the DR11, DRB5, and DR1 alleles correlated well with antigen sensi-
tivities measured in transduced J76 (r = 0.85, P = 0.016; Figure 6D), 
suggesting that TCR affinity dictated TCR function.
Two 
other 
TRAV24 
public 
clonotypes, 
TRAV24-S 
(ASKAAGNKLT) and TRAV24-RR (SRRAAGNKLT), conferred 
cross-restriction by 4 HLA-DR alleles when paired to TRBV2 
chains 24 and 5, respectively (Supplemental Table 11), emphasizing 
that broad HLA cross-restriction was a frequent property of pub-
lic clonotypes. We then tested the pairing of TRAV24-F with two 
TRBV2 public clonotypes: TRBV2-4 (ASSPGTSGVGEQF), shared 
by 2 controllers; and TRBV2-13 (ASSRRTSGGTDTQY), the most 
prevalent TRBV2 clonotype, shared by 4 controllers. The result-
ing TCRs, F4 and F13, were cross-restricted by 3 HLA-DR alleles 
(DR11, DR15, and DRB5) (Figure 6B). While F4 had relatively good 
antigen sensitivity (10–6 M) when restricted by DR11, it gave only 
low responses with the two other alleles. In contrast, F13 showed 
good antigen sensitivity with DR11 (7.5 × 10–7 M) and intermedi-
ate sensitivity with the two other alleles (Supplemental Table 11). 
F13, like F24, carried an R at position 5 of the TRBV2 CDR3 junc-
tion, which may contribute to the efficient detection of Gag293 in 
varied HLA backgrounds. Two TCRs derived from private clono-
types from treated patients were studied for comparison. TCRs 
HD5 and HY9 comprised the most prevalent TRAV24 and TRBV2 
clonotypes from treated patients HAART3 and HAART6, respec-
tively (Supplemental Table 11). These TCRs yielded responses of 
medium avidity when restricted by DR15 and DR1 (10–5 M ≤ EC50 
≤ 10–6 M), gave only low responses in the presence of DRB5 L cells, 
and did not react with DR11 L cells (Figure 6C). While these TCRs 
from treated patients could react with several HLA-DR alleles, their 
degree of cross-restriction appeared narrower than that observed 
for controller TCRs. Taken together, the analysis of recombinant 
TCRs specific for Gag293 highlighted that the most prevalent pub-
lic clonotypes conferred efficient Gag293 recognition in the con-
text of multiple HLA-DR alleles. Interestingly, antigen sensitivity 
measured for the 8 TCRs tested in the presence of DR11 correlated 
with the number of HLA-DR alleles restricting each of these TCRs 
(r = –0.86, P = 0.006; Figure 6E), suggesting that both properties 
depended on the same TCR features.
We next verified that the recombinant TCRs could recognize 
native HIV capsid antigens naturally processed by APCs, in addi-
tion to peptide-pulsed APCs. To this end, we used infected mono-
cyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) as alternative APCs. MDDCs 
from DR11+ healthy donors were infected with an HIV-1 pseudo-
typed virus and incubated with J76 cells expressing the F24, F25, 
or F5 TCR. The TCR-transduced cells showed robust CD69 induc-
tion in the presence of infected MDDCs, while CD69 expression 
remained moderate in the absence of infection (Figure 6F). CD69 
that depended both on the presenting HLA-DR allele and on the 
nature of the TRBV2 chain.
Tetramer titration experiments showed the expected hierar-
chy among the 3 TCRs (F24>F25>F5) but did not prove sensitive 
enough to determine TCR avidity for F25 and F5 (Supplemental 
Figure 12). To precisely determine TCR affinity, we expressed 
the F24, F25, and F5 TCRs as soluble recombinant proteins and 
measured their binding to Gag293–HLA-DR monomers by sur-
face plasmon resonance (SPR). The soluble TCRs were passed 
over chips coated with immobilized DR11, DRB5, or DR1 mono-
mers loaded with Gag293 (example of sensorgram in Figure 
5D). In agreement with tetramer binding assays, the 3 TCRs 
recognized Gag293–HLA-DR complexes with different affini-
ties (F24>F25>F5). This hierarchy was conserved across the dif-
ferent HLA-DR alleles tested (Figure 5E). Of note, the F24 TCR 
recognized the Gag293-DR11 complex with a very high affinity, 
of 0.86 μM (Table 3), which is rarely seen for MHC II–restricted 
TCRs (36). F24 bound the Gag293-DRB5 and Gag293-DR1 com-
plexes with affinities that were 3- and 8-fold lower, respectively, 
but still remained in the high-affinity range (<10 μM). The F25 
and F5 TCRs also interacted with the Gag293-DR11 complex with 
relatively high affinities (3 and 11 μM, respectively), while affini-
ties were intermediate or low for the two other allomorphs tested. 
The percentage of Tet+ cells in TCR-transduced J76 cells, when 
measurable, correlated well with affinities measured by SPR (r = 
0.92; Figure 5F), consistent with the notion that tetramer binding 
predominantly depends on TCR affinity. These results showed 
that association of the TRAV24-F public clonotype with highly 
expressed TRBV2 clonotypes could, for certain combinations, 
generate HLA-cross-restricted TCRs of unusually high affinity.
Transfer of TCRs containing public TRAV24 and TRBV2 clono-
types confers high antigen sensitivity to J76 cells. TCR function was 
tested by monitoring the induction of the early activation marker 
CD69 in transduced J76 cells. Murine fibroblastic L cells engi-
neered to express a single human HLA-DR allele were used as 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), allowing precise control of the 
restricting HLA molecule. L cells expressing DR1, DR11, DR15, or 
DRB5 (Figure 6A) and DR3, DR4, or DR7 (Supplemental Table 11) 
were pulsed with decreasing doses of Gag293 peptide and cocul-
tured with J76 cells transduced with the F24, F25, and F5 TCRs. The 
3 TCRs could signal and trigger T cell activation, as indicated by 
the induction of CD69 in ≥50% of J76 cells in the presence of DR11 
APCs. The F24 TCR showed the broadest reactivity, as it induced 
strong T cell activation in the presence of DR11, DR15, DRB5, and 
DR1 APCs, and weak but consistent T cell activation in the pres-

Comparison of the last Gag293 peptide dilution that induced a spe-
cific cell line showed that, among DR11 patients, 3 of 3 controllers 
and 1 of 4 treated patient responded at a dilution less than 10–5 M 
(Supplemental Figure 13A). Trends for a higher Gag293-specific 
ELISPOT response and for more prominent TRAV24 biases were 
also noted in DR11 controllers as compared with DR11-treated 
patients (Supplemental Figure 13, B and C). Taken together, these 
findings support the notion that particular clonotypes expressed 
induction followed the same hierarchy as that observed when L 
cells were used as APCs (F24>F25>F5), indicating that TCR prop-
erties were conserved in different antigen presentation systems.
As the public clonotypes consistently generated TCRs with 
optimal antigen sensitivity in the context of DR11, it was important 
to verify that differences in antigen sensitivity between the HIC 
and the HAART group did not depend on a bias in DR11 expres-
sion. Among the 29 patients included in the study, 3 controllers 
and 4 treated patients expressed a DR11 allele, including HLA-

peptide doses as low as 10–8 M for F24, and as low as 10–7 M for 
F25 and F5. After F24 transfer, polyfunctional cells expressing at 
least 3 functions still represented more than half of CD4+ T cells 
responding to 10–9 M peptide, emphasizing that polyfunctional 
responses could be achieved after stimulation with minimal 
amounts of Gag antigen.
Interestingly, CD8+ T cells transduced with the F24 TCR also 
showed a Gag293-specific cytokine response, with detectable 
induction of the 5 markers tested (Figure 7, D and E). Cytokine 
response in CD8+ T cells transduced with F25 and F5 remained 
low or undetectable (data not shown). The F24-dependent 
response in CD8+ T cells could be blocked by treatment with an 
anti–HLA-DR antibody, indicating that it was restricted by MHC 
II (Supplemental Figure 15A). Thus, the high-affinity TCR F24 was 
able to confer a Gag293-specific response in the absence of CD4 
coreceptor expression, in a situation where availability of the Lck 
kinase may be limiting. F24 transfer induced 3 functions or more 
in greater than 25% of specific CD8+ T cells at peptide doses as 
low as 10–7 M (Supplemental Figure 15B), indicating that this high- 
affinity TCR could confer polyfunctional responses to CD8+ T 
cells. Thus, controller clonotypes could be used to generate TCRs 
with uncommon properties, including affinities in the micromolar 
range, broad HLA-DR cross-restriction, high antigen sensitivity, 
and polyfunctionality in both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets.
Discussion
Exploration of the TCR repertoire specific for the most immuno-
prevalent CD4 epitope in HIV-1 Gag revealed a repertoire mark-
edly biased toward the TRAV24 and TRBV2 gene families. Highly 
prevalent public motifs and public clonotypes were preferen-
tially shared by HIV controllers, suggesting that particular TCR 
determinants contributed to the efficiency of the antiviral CD4 
response in these patients. This notion was reinforced by func-
tional analysis of the most prevalent public clonotypes, as these 
were able to confer HLA-cross-restricted, highly sensitive, poly-
functional responses against Gag antigens, indicative of superior 
function. These findings, which to our knowledge provide the first 
assessment of the HIV-specific CD4+ T cell repertoire at the clo-
notypic level, emphasize that intrinsic TCR determinants, rather 
than low antigenemia, specify the remarkable properties of the 
cellular response in controlled HIV infection.
It was noteworthy that both the TRAV24 and TRBV2 rep-
ertoires specific for Gag293 showed a high degree of motif and 
clonotype sharing. So far, most studies of the human TCR reper-
toire have focused on TRB genes, but recent analyses suggest that 
the human TRA repertoire is even more diverse (38). Our findings 
provide evidence for a dual bias in controlled HIV infection, with 
both TCR chains showing a significant degree of motif conserva-
tion. The most prevalent TRAV24 clonotype (AFKAAGNKLT) was 
present in 6 of 8 controllers (75%) studied. In comparison, CD8 
TRB public clonotypes reported in previous studies of the HIV- 
specific repertoire were shared by 2–4 patients (13, 14, 39, 40). 
When the analysis was extended to less-stringent definitions of 
TCR biases, close to half of TRAV24 and TRBV2 clonotypes shared 
defined public motifs, while the corresponding frequencies were 
of 29% and 10%, respectively, for clonotypes of treated patients. 
Such strong bias in the Gag293-specific TCR repertoire of control-
in controlled HIV infection, rather than merely the expression of 
DR11, are associated with high-avidity Gag293-specific responses.
Transfer of the F24 TCR confers polyfunctionality to primary 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We next evaluated the properties of the F24, 
F25, and F5 TCRs when transferred directly into primary T cells, 
a system physiologically more relevant to potential TCR transfer 
applications. TCR-transduced PBMCs from healthy donors were 
analyzed for exogenous TCR expression with a TRBV2-specific 
mAb. Mock-transduced CD4+ T cells expressed endogenous 
TRBV2 at levels below 5%, while TCR-transduced CD4+ T cells 
showed TRBV2 expression rates in the 25%–35% range (Supple-
mental Figure 14A). The hierarchy of HLA-DR tetramer binding 
was consistent with that observed in J76 cells, with F24 showing 
significant binding to 4 different tetramers (DR11, DR15, DRB5, 
and DR1); F25 reacting mostly to the DR11 and DRB5 tetramers 
and minimally to the DR1 tetramer; and F5 showing barely detect-
able tetramer binding (Supplemental Figure 14, B and C).
For evaluation of TCR function, PBMCs from DR11, DR15, DR1, 
or DRB5 donors were TCR transduced and cocultured with autol-
ogous MDDCs pulsed with Gag293. A panel of 5 markers, includ-
ing the cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, and IFN-γ, the chemo 
kine MIP-1β/
CCL4, and the degranulation marker CD107a, was assayed by 
intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). CD4+ T cells transduced with 
the F24, F25, and F5 TCRs showed abundant cytokine production 
and degranulation capacity after high-dose Gag293 peptide stim-
ulation (Figure 7A). A specific ICS response was detected in ≥50% 
CD4+ T cells transduced with F24, while in the same experiment 
TRBV2 expression increased by only 25% after transduction (Sup-
plemental Figure 14A), pointing to efficient cytokine production 
even in cells expressing limiting amounts of transduced TCR. 
ICS responses were then measured in the presence of decreasing 
Gag293 peptide concentrations (as shown for F24-transduced cells; 
Figure 7B). The hierarchy of marker induction was conserved across 
peptide doses, with high expression of TNF-α and IL-2, intermedi-
ate expression of MIP-1β, and more limited expression of CD107a 
and IFN-γ. Of note, specific expression of these 5 markers persisted 
at very low peptide doses (10–9 to 10–10 M). Antigen sensitivity was 
quantified for the 3 TCRs by measuring the EC50 for induction of 
the 5 markers tested (Figure 7C). This analysis confirmed the func-
tional hierarchy among the TCRs (F24>F25>F5), which followed 
the TCR affinity ranking. F24 conferred a highly sensitive detection 
of Gag293 in primary cells, with EC50 values varying between 10–9 
and 10–8 M when TNF-α, CD107a, or MIP-1β production was mea-
sured. IFN-γ responses appeared comparatively less sensitive, with 
EC50 values between 10–8 and 10–7 M, while IL-2 gave intermediate 
values. Thus, only TCRs with particularly high affinity, such as F24, 
may lead to full Th1 differentiation with IFN-γ production in situa-
tions of low antigen availability.
Polyfunctionality, or the capacity to express multiple cytokines 
simultaneously, is a hallmark of controller T cells and is thought to 
provide superior effector functions (16, 21, 37). Quantification of 
the number of functions (or markers) coexpressed by TCR-trans-
duced cells revealed a high degree of polyfunctionality (Figure 
7F). Indeed, the majority (>65%) of F24-, F25-, and F5-express-
ing cells could be deemed polyfunctional, as they expressed more 
than 3 functions after high-dose Gag293 stimulation. CD4+ T cells 
coexpressing the full set of markers (5 functions) were detected at

Gag293, with the induction of a highly biased, high-affinity TCR 
repertoire in controlled infection. The preferential detection of 
Gag-specific CD4 responses in HIV controllers (20) suggests that 
several regions of Gag may be targeted by high-affinity TCRs, 
though this remains to be investigated. High-affinity CD4 TCRs 
are endowed with strong proliferative capacity (41), which helps 
explain how they could reach such a dominance in controlled HIV 
infection. The high affinity of controller TCRs also translated into 
efficient cytokine secretion upon Gag293 peptide stimulation. 
Primary CD4+ T cells transduced with the F24 TCR showed EC50 
values ranging between 10–8 M and 10–9 M peptide for the different 
cytokines studied, indicative of a remarkably high antigen sensi-
tivity for the CD4+ T cell subset. Polyfunctionality, a property that 
has been associated with HIV control (37), showed a clear depen-
dence on TCR affinity. Comparison of the F24, F25, and F5 TCRs 
showed that a difference of 1.1 log in affinity resulted in a 2-log 
difference in the peptide concentration at which half the specific 
cells retained 3 functions. Thus, TCR affinity appears critical in 
determining the range of cytokines produced, particularly at low 
antigen dose. Of interest, not all cytokines were equally depen-
dent on the strength of the TCR signal, with TNF-α showing the 
lowest requirements and IFN-γ the most stringent. The notion of a 
hierarchy in cytokine production is consistent with a report show-
ing that the affinity of Gag-specific T cell clones dictated their 
cytokine expression profile (10). It is relevant that for CD4+ T cells, 
in contrast to CD8+ T cells, IFN-γ is the most “demanding” cyto-
kine, as it can be produced only by high-avidity cells upon limiting 
antigenic stimulation. IFN-γ plays a key role in CD4+ T cell helper 
function, through its capacity to upregulate MHC II in APCs and 
prime them for efficient antigen presentation. In addition, IFN-γ 
production by tissue CD4+ T cells plays an underappreciated role 
in the recruitment of immune effectors, through the triggering of 
chemokine cascades (46). In controlled HIV infection, high-avid-
ity Gag-specific CD4+ T cells may play a similar role, by keeping 
the immune system in constant alert and rapidly recruiting CD8+ 
T cells and NK cells to sites of HIV replication upon the occurrence 
of viral replication blips. In addition, IFN-γ secretion may play a 
direct antiviral role, through the induction of IFN-stimulated 
genes (ISGs) that inhibit HIV replication (47). For instance, Th1 
cells are thought to be less infectable than Th2 cells due to their 
higher expression of the HIV restriction factor APOBEC3G (48). 
Highly differentiated Th1 effectors that reexpress CD45RA appear 
particularly resistant to HIV infection (49). Gag-specific CD4+ T 
cells in controllers maintain a Th1 differentiation status with per-
sistent IFN-γ production (22), raising the possibility that such cells 
possess a degree of resistance to HIV infection. This would be 
consistent with studies that documented a lower susceptibility of 
controller CD4+ T cells to HIV replication in vitro (50). Thus, high 
TCR affinity, with the associated capacity for IFN-γ expression at 
low antigen dose, may contribute to HIV control at several levels, 
through sensitive immune surveillance, rapid triggering of helper 
functions, and direct antiviral effector mechanisms.
Of interest, the F24 TCR was able to confer polyfunctional 
cytokine responses when transferred into CD8+ T cells. The 
responses were MHC II restricted, indicating that the F24 TCR 
could interact with the Gag293–MHC II complex in the absence of 
the CD4 coreceptor. The CD4 molecule is not thought to contrib-
lers could not be attributed to amplification of a few clonotypes 
during culture, as the repertoire of controllers remained highly 
diverse, with a median of 36 distinct TRBV2 clonotypes per 100 
CDR3 sequences. In addition, similar frequencies of public motifs 
were detected in vitro and ex vivo when the TCR repertoire of con-
trollers could be analyzed in both conditions. Rather, these find-
ings suggest that strong selective pressures (further discussed in 
the supplemental material) shaped the Gag293-specific repertoire 
during the establishment of viral control.
The coexpression of TRAV24 and TRBV2 public clonotypes 
generated functional TCRs that, for some combinations, dis-
played a remarkably high affinity for Gag293–MHC II complexes. 
Human TCRs generally show affinities in the 1 to 100 μM range 
by SPR analysis (36). MHC II–restricted TCRs show a trend for 
a lower affinity as compared with MHC I–restricted TCRs, with 
average KD values of 70 versus 35 μM, respectively. With a KD of 
0.86 μM for the Gag293-DR11 complex, F24 demonstrated one 
of the highest affinities reported so far for an MHC I– restricted 
TCR, ranking second in a list of 22 human and mouse TCRs for 
which structural data are available (36). The molecular determi-
nants of a high-avidity interaction for the Gag293-MHC complex 
appear to depend both on the TRAV24 and TRBV2 chains and on 
the restricting HLA allele. The most conserved CDR3 residues 
in public motifs represent likely candidates for contact residues 
with Gag293. However, conserved CDR1/CDR2 residues may 
also contact the Gag293 peptide, considering the predominance 
of the TRAV24 and TRBV2 families. Future structural studies 
should help determine the respective roles of the CDR3 ver-
sus the CDR1/2 regions in shaping high-avidity interactions for 
Gag293-MHC complexes. The expression of high-affinity TCRs 
for Gag293 in controllers resulted in high antigen sensitivity as 
measured by CD69 induction, with a good correlation between 
the two parameters (r = 0.85). Thus, TCR biophysical properties 
largely accounted for TCR function, consistent with multiple stud-
ies in animal models (41, 42). It should be noted, however, that in 
some studies TCRs with very high or supraphysiological affinities 
were found to have reduced functions (43). A proposed explana-
tion is that a peptide-MHC (pMHC) that interacts too tightly with 
a very high-affinity TCR cannot disengage to contact additional 
TCRs and thus does not achieve serial TCR triggering and T cell 
response amplification (44). We did not observe decreased func-
tions for the TCR/pMHC II combinations showing the highest 
affinities by SPR, suggesting that TCR affinities in the order of 
 
1 μM are still in the physiological range for optimal TCR function 
in human CD4+ T cells.
The reasons for the preferential amplification of high-affin-
ity Gag293-specific TCRs in controllers compared with treated 
patients remain to be elucidated. A particular genetic background 
or a limited duration of acute infection may have promoted 
the amplification of such TCRs in controllers (45). Conversely, 
patients who initially progressed to disease may have lost the 
high-avidity CD4+ T cell population due to preferential infection 
and depletion, a notion supported by the restricted CD4 TCR 
repertoire observed in treated patients, and by rapid loss of cer-
tain CD4 specificities after the acute infection stage (6). It will 
be informative to determine whether other immunoprevalent 
HIV epitopes elicit a response pattern similar to that observed for

Differences between groups were analyzed with the nonparametric 
Mann-Whitney U test, with the exception of total clonotypic reper-
toires, for which means were compared by unpaired 2-tailed t tests. 
Differences in cell line response frequencies and HLA-DR allele fre-

ute significantly to the affinity of the pMHC/TCR/CD4 complex 
but plays an important role in relocating the kinase Lck close to the 
TCR/CD3 signaling complex (51). The lower cytokine responses in 
CD8+ than in CD4+ T cells may thus result from a lower number 
of Lck molecules available for triggering intracellular signals. The 
transfer of the F24 TCR to CD8+ T cells still conferred the 5 func-
tions tested at the 10–5 M to 10–7 M antigen dose, suggesting that 
transduced CD8+ T cells could become efficient effectors in foci of 
productive HIV replication. These findings open the possibility of 
reprogramming CD8+ T cells to target the highly conserved major 
homology region (MHR) of capsid, which could be advantageous 
given the high fitness cost associated with mutations in this region 
(52). The report that a CMV-based protective SIV vaccine elic-
ited a high frequency of unconventional MHC II–restricted CD8 
responses highlights the potential benefits of CD8+ T cell repro-
gramming (53). Studies of TCR transfer for cancer immunotherapy 
have shown that transferring the same TCR into both CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells could enhance tumoricidal activity (54). Similarly, 
the transfer of a high-avidity Gag-specific TCRs in both CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cell populations may be of interest for adoptive T cell thera-
pies targeting HIV, in order to trigger a full set of antiviral functions.
In conclusion, study of TCRs specific for the immunopreva-
lent CD4 epitope in capsid revealed that particular clonotypes 
are associated with HIV control. The TCR repertoire of control-
lers was characterized by a high prevalence of public TRAV24 and 
TRBV2 chains. Reconstituted TCRs showed affinities that reached 
the micromolar range, at the high end of values obtained for nat-
urally expressed TCRs. Public clonotypes conferred MHC II 
cross-restriction, high antigen sensitivity, and polyfunctionality to 
CD4+ T cells, suggesting a key role in shaping the properties of an 
efficient CD4 response. The most prevalent public clonotype also 
proved functional in CD8+ T cells, suggesting that it could be used 
to target the highly conserved capsid MHR region in patients of 
diverse HLA types. Inducing or transferring such clonotypes may 
contribute to the development of immunotherapeutic approaches 
that aim at a functional cure of HIV infection.
Methods
Study design. HIV controllers (HIC group; n = 14) were recruited 
through the CO21 CODEX cohort implemented by ANRS. HIV 
controllers were defined as HIV-1–infected patients who had been 
seropositive for more than 5 years, had received no antiretroviral 
treatment, and for whom more than 90% of plasma viral load mea-
surements were undetectable by standard assays. All HIV controllers 
included in the study had current viral loads of less than 50 copies/ml. 
The group of efficiently treated patients (HAART group; n = 14) had 
received antiretroviral therapy for a minimum of 5 years and showed 
long term HIV-1 suppression with viral loads of less than 50 copies/ml. 
Treated patients were recruited at the Raymond Poincaré and Bicêtre 
hospitals (France). Patients were included in the TCR study if their 
genotype matched at least one of the following alleles: DRB1*0101 
(DR1), DRB1*1101 (DR11), DRB1*1501 (DR15), or DRB5*0101 (DRB5). 
Healthy donors were anonymous volunteers who donated blood at 
Etablissement Français du Sang.

tional analyses of the Gag293-specific TCR repertoire are described
