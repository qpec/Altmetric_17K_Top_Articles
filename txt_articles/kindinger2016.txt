Preterm birth, the leading cause of death in children under 5 years, may be caused by inflammation triggered by
ascending vaginal infection. About 2 million cervical cerclages are performed annually to prevent preterm birth. The
procedure is thought to provide structural support and maintain the endocervical mucus plug as a barrier to as-
cending infection. Two types of suture material are used for cerclage: monofilament or multifilament braided. Braided
sutures are most frequently used, although no evidence exists to favor them over monofilament sutures. We
assessed birth outcomes in a retrospective cohort of 678 women receiving cervical cerclage in five UK university
hospitals and showed that braided cerclage was associated with increased intrauterine death (15% versus 5%; P =
0.0001) and preterm birth (28% versus 17%; P = 0.0006) compared to monofilament suture. To understand the
potential underlying mechanism, we performed a prospective, longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiome in
women at risk of preterm birth because of short cervical length (≤25 mm) who received braided (n = 25) or mono-
filament (n = 24) cerclage under comparable circumstances. Braided suture induced a persistent shift toward vaginal
microbiome dysbiosis characterized by reduced Lactobacillus spp. and enrichment of pathobionts. Vaginal dysbiosis
was associated with inflammatory cytokine and interstitial collagenase excretion into cervicovaginal fluid and pre-
mature cervical remodeling. Monofilament suture had comparatively minimal impact upon the vaginal microbiome
and its interactions with the host. These data provide in vivo evidence that a dynamic shift of the human vaginal
microbiome toward dysbiosis correlates with preterm birth.
INTRODUCTION
Each year, preterm birth (PTB; defined as delivery before 37 weeks
of gestation) causes more than 1 million deaths worldwide (1). Al-
though PTB has multiple etiologies, infection is thought to be a
causal mechanism in up to 50% of cases (2). It has been postulated
that microbiota may spread hematogenously (3) or ascend from the
vagina along mucosal surfaces. During a healthy pregnancy, the uterus
and fetus are protected from ascending infection from the vagina by
the cervix, which acts as a functional and physical barrier to bacteria
and pathogens (4). In the vagina, Lactobacillus spp. stability and dom-
inance are central to reproductive health. Pregnancy induces a shift in
the vaginal microbiome from a temporally dynamic community struc-
ture in nonpregnant women (5) toward stable, Lactobacillus spp. dom-
inance that inhibits growth of pathobionts (6, 7). The vaginal
microbiome at delivery also acts as an important source of pioneering
microbiota for the neonatal gut microbiome, thus implicating it in
long-term health outcomes (8, 9). An association between vaginal
dysbiosis during pregnancy, characterized by reduced quantities of
Lactobacillus spp., and PTB has long been recognized (2, 10); women
diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis (BV) have a two- and sixfold increased
risk of PTB and late miscarriage, respectively (10). Recent analyses
of the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy using culture-independent
methods lend further support to associate vaginal dysbiosis and
PTB (11).
Cervical cerclage (12, 13) and progesterone supplementation (14)
are the only widely used clinical strategies for the prevention of PTB,
with an estimated 2 million cerclage procedures performed annually
(15). Cervical cerclage reduces the risk of PTB by about 20% in wom-
en with a history of spontaneous PTB and/or a short cervical length
(CL) (16, 17), and its use in these circumstances is recommended by
both the American and the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists (12, 13). Its mechanisms of action are uncertain, but
it is thought to provide mechanical support to a weakened cervix
(18) as well as to support the cervical mucosal plug as a barrier to
ascending infection (4). However, cervical cerclage is associated with
increased risk of infection (17, 19). The procedure involves placing a
purse-string stitch around the cervix with or without a dissection of
the bladder away from the cervix, although there is no evidence for a
benefit of bladder dissection (20). Two different suture materials,
braided or monofilament, are used for the procedure, with braided
preferred by 80% of surgeons without an evidence base (21, 22). Braided
suture is composed of nonabsorbable polyester ethylene tereph-
thalate fibers braided together to form a 5-mm-wide mesh tape. The
tape is characteristically high in tensile strength and is thought to pro-
vide a secure structural support to a weakened cervix because of its

 high coefficient of friction (18). Monofilament sutures are made of
a single strand of nonabsorbable polyamide polymer, and because of
their simple structure, they provide less mechanical resistance when
passed through tissue. As a result, they have a tendency to slip and
therefore require a greater number of throws to secure the knot than
a braided suture (18), which is why the braided suture is usually
preferred.
However, an association between braided suture use and in-
creased risk of infection in other disciplines (23, 24) has informed
the hypothesis that pregnancy outcome after cervical cerclage may
be influenced by suture material (15). Aiming to assess the impact
of cerclage suture on vaginal microbiota, we hypothesized that the
braided suture material promotes pathobiont colonization of the
vagina, resulting in activation of inflammatory parturition pathways
and premature cervical ripening. Here, we have undertaken a retro-
spective analysis of pregnancy outcomes in women receiving a clini-
cally indicated cervical cerclage over a 10-year period across five
university hospitals in the United Kingdom. After this, a prospective
cohort of women at risk of PTB were randomized to either braided
or monofilament suture material. Longitudinal profiling of their vagi-
nal microbiome in the context of cerclage insertion was undertaken
using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Cytokine expres-
sion profiling of matched cervicovaginal fluid samples and cervical
vascular assessment by four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound were con-
currently performed as measures of physiological responses to cerclage
insertion and changing microbial composition.
RESULTS
Retrospective assessment of suture materials’ effects on
pregnancy outcomes
A total of 671 women receiving cervical cerclage during pregnancy
were identified from five UK university hospitals within a 10-year
period. Of these, 327 (49%) received a braided suture material and
344 (51%) received monofilament suture for their cervical cerclage.
In women receiving a braided cerclage, higher rates of nonviable
births (delivery <24 weeks or intrauterine death) were observed com-
pared to those receiving the monofilament alternative (15% versus 5%,
respectively; P < 0.0001; Fig. 1A). Increased rates of PTB (24 to 37 weeks’
gestation) were also observed in women receiving braided cerclage
(28% braided versus 17% monofilament; P < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact
test; Fig. 1A). Comparison of available demographics demonstrated
that consistent with known clinical practice (21, 22), preference of su-
ture material varied across hospital sites (table S1). Linear mixed-
effects modeling excluding hospital location, which is linked to the
choice of suture material, demonstrated that although history of a pre-
vious PTB was a significant contributor to nonviable births, braided
suture was the primary driver of the observed outcome independent
of potential confounders, including maternal age, ethnicity, and parity
(fig. S1), but not hospital location. The effect of previous PTB was lost
when hospital location was included in the model (table S2). In both
analyses, suture material was the major variable influencing the risk of
PTB independent of maternal age, ethnicity, parity, and history of a
previous PTB.
Data on gestational age at cerclage insertion and corresponding
CL were available for women receiving an ultrasound-indicated cerc-
lage (for CL, ≤25 mm). Distribution of CL was comparable among
monofilament and braided groups (P = 0.2, Mann-Whitney test; table
S1), and as would be expected, a shorter cervix significantly
contributed to the risk of adverse outcome (P = 0.019). A subanalysis
using linear mixed-effects regression models demonstrated that suture
material remained a significant contributing factor for both PTB (P =
0.00002) and nonviable pregnancy (P = 0.006) among ultrasound-
indicated cerclages after adjusting for potential confounders includ-
ing gestational age at insertion (table S2).
Baseline characteristics of the prospective study subjects
Women who were attending prematurity surveillance clinic after a
history of PTB and were sonographically identified as having a short
cervix (≤25 mm) were prospectively recruited and randomized to
receive a cerclage using either braided Mersilene (n = 25) or mono-
filament Ethilon (n = 24) suture material. Demographics among su-
ture material groups, including gestation and CL at cerclage insertion, as
well as gestational age at delivery, were comparable (Table 1 and fig. S2).
Suture materials’ impact on the vaginal microbiome
The data set consisted of 2,792,842 high-quality gene sequences, with a
mean sequence read count of 13,825 per sample (range, 689 to
1,396,421). Using bacterial genera sequence data, samples were
classified according to their vaginal bacterial communities as normal
(>90% Lactobacillus spp.), intermediate (30 to 90% Lactobacillus spp.),
or dysbiotic (<30% Lactobacillus spp.) (Fig. 1B and table S3). Before
cerclage insertion, prevalence of intermediate and dysbiotic micro-
biomes in monofilament and braided patient groups was similar
(16.7% versus 17.3%; P = 0.7; Fig. 1C). These were higher than the
rates of dysbiosis observed in the background low-risk pregnant
population at the same gestational age not requiring intervention
who had normal pregnancy outcomes (6%; Fisher’s exact test, P =
0.03) (6).
Insertion of the braided cerclage caused a marked shift toward
dysbiosis at 4 weeks after the procedure, which persisted until the
final follow-up time point, at 16 weeks after cerclage insertion [P =
0.008, analysis of variance (ANOVA); Fig. 1C and table S4]. When
assessed at the species level (figs. S3 and S4, and tables S4 and S5),
braided cerclage insertion was associated with an increasing pro-
portion of women with community state type (CST) IV, characterized
by reduced numbers of Lactobacillus spp. and increased diversity of
anaerobic bacteria (6, 25). Before the insertion of braided cerclage,
13% were classified as CST IV, increasing to 45% at 4 weeks and
50% at 16 weeks after cerclage (P = 0.02; fig. S4A and table S4). In
contrast, microbial disruption was not observed in women receiving
monofilament cerclage, who instead demonstrated maintenance of
high Lactobacillus spp. abundance (CSTs I, II, III, and V) and stability
throughout longitudinal sampling (P = 0.9; fig. S4A and table S4). To
identify degrees of dysbiosis that were not identified by CST classifi-
cation, we also undertook alternate species-level classification based on
dominance of vaginal bacterial communities by Lactobacillus species
associated with stability and health. Lactobacillus iners dominance was
more frequently associated with transition to dysbiosis, as well as
intermediate and severe dysbiosis (26). Although L. iners has previous-
ly been observed as an intermediary toward dysbiosis, there was no
significant change in L. iners abundance in association with insertion
of a monofilament or braided suture material (fig. S4B and table S5).
An in vitro adhesion assay showed that braided suture cultured
with the vaginal commensal Lactobacillus jensenii or the pathobiont

 Escherichia coli resulted in a 16- and 20-fold greater bacterial load ad-
herence per unit length (cm), respectively, compared to monofilament
suture (P = 0.03 and P = 0.0003, respectively, Student’s t test; fig. S5).
To identify bacteria specifically associated with braided suture
insertion, we performed linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with
effect size (LEfSe) (27) on the 16S rRNA sequence data collected be-
fore and 4 weeks after the procedure. Although no differences were
identified between patient groups before insertion, braided cerclage
resulted in enriched numbers of Gram-negative bacteria at 4 weeks
(Fig. 2, A and B). This correlated with a fivefold increase in the num-
ber of dysbiotic samples collected after braided cerclage insertion com-
pared to monofilament cerclage (P = 0.04, ANOVA; Fig. 2C). Use of
braided cerclage was characterized by increased numbers of bacteria as-
sociated with BV, including species of Prevotella (P = 0.02), Finegoldia
(P = 0.02), and Dialister (P = 0.04), and reduced Lactobacillus spp. (Fig.
2, A and B, and fig. S6). Targeted quantitative polymerase chain reac-
tion (qPCR) suggested that insertion of braided suture was associated
with an increase in mean copy numbers of both Atopobium vaginae
(594,326 before cerclage versus 5,081,000 after cerclage; P = 0.07) and
Gardnerella vaginalis (961,805 before cerclage versus 10,170,000 after

compared to those receiving a monofilament alternative (15% versus 5%, re-

(>90% Lactobacillus abundance), intermediate (30 to 90% Lactobacillus abun-

associated with a fivefold increase in microbial dysbiosis within 4 weeks of

act test before versus after cerclage and two-way ANOVA for monofilament

 cerclage; P = 0.05; fig. S7 and table S6). In contrast, no change in the
amount of G. vaginalis or A. vaginae was detected after monofilament
cerclage. Consistent with these observations, indices of bacterial
community richness (Fig. 2D) and a diversity (Fig. 2E) were in-
creased in samples collected after braided suture compared to mono-
filament, with the greatest differences observed at 16 weeks after
cerclage (P = 0.02, ANOVA, Bonferroni multiple comparison).
Inflammatory response to cerclage insertion
Insertion of braided, but not monofilament, cerclage increased the
release of inflammatory cytokines into cervicovaginal fluid, includ-
ing interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor–a (TNF-
a), and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) (Fig. 3, A to F). No change
was detected in anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 (Fig. 3G), IL-2, or
IL-10 (table S7). We observed a strong association between severe
dysbiosis (<30% Lactobacillus spp.) and increased cervicovaginal
fluid concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines ICAM-1 (inter-
cellular adhesion molecule 1), IL-1b, IL-6, MMP-1, MCP-1 (monocyte
chemotactic protein 1), TNF-a, GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor), and IFN-g (interferon-g), as well as the
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 when compared to women harbor-
ing Lactobacillus spp.–dominated microbiomes (Fig. 3H).
Impact on cervical vasculature after cerclage
We constructed 3D cervical vascular trees from ultrasound data and
assessed the indices of cervical vasculature [vascularity index (VI)]
(28) for morphological differences in the cervix according to suture
material. The vascularity was not significantly different between
the two groups before cerclage insertion (Fig. 4A). Braided cerclage
was strongly associated with increased cervical vascularization 4 weeks
after the procedure, and this relationship persisted until 16 weeks after
insertion (P = 0.0003, ANOVA, Bonferroni multiple comparison; Fig.
4A). A positive correlation of cervical vascularity with both the num-
ber of bacterial species (Fig. 4B; R2 = 0.09, P = 0.002) and a diversity
(Fig. 4C; R2 = 0.14, P = 0.001) was observed in women receiving a
braided cerclage. No relationship between monofilament suture,
cervical vascularization, and indices of microbial diversity or rich-
ness was observed.
DISCUSSION
Braided suture material is commonly used in preference to mono-
filament for cervical cerclage (21), because it is assumed that braided
suture provides a more secure cerclage that is less likely to slip or tear
the cervix (18); however, this assumption is not evidence-based. Here,
we show that use of braided suture material is associated with an
increased risk of PTB and nonviable pregnancy, although this will
need to be confirmed in a prospective randomized study. Braided cer-
vical cerclage induces vaginal dysbiosis, increases excretion of inflam-
matory cytokines into the cervicovaginal fluid, and induces premature
cervical vascular remodeling. In contrast, monofilament suture has
minimal impact upon the vaginal microbiome and inflammatory
pathways associated with premature onset of parturition. These find-
ings have clinical relevance for cerclage procedures in pregnancy and
wider implications for braided suture use in other surgical procedures,
particularly in potentially contaminated sites. On the basis of an about
2 million cervical cerclages per annum (15), 80% of which are
performed using braided suture (21), we estimate that a global shift
to monofilament suture use for cervical cerclage would prevent

Although cervical cerclage is effective in preventing PTB in
singleton pregnancies with a previous PTB (17, 29), our data show
that braided cervical cerclage increases vaginal dysbiosis and in-
flammation and likely accounts for the doubled risk of puerperal
sepsis (19) with no improvement in neonatal outcome (17) after
cerclage insertion. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that
the braided cerclage is of no benefit and may even be detrimental
in other groups that are at high risk for PTB, such as multiple preg-
nancies (30) and women with a shortened cervix after excisional
treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (31–34). The role
of suture material in cerclage efficacy has largely been neglected,
with studies rarely detailing the suture material used for the pro-
cedure (35). To date, only one randomized controlled trial has been
conducted to examine the impact of suture material on pregnancy
outcomes, but this study was limited to the comparison of two braided
materials, and no differences in PTB rates were observed (22). Reeva-
luation of existing literature on cervical cerclage use in pregnancy for
the prevention of PTB is required in light of our findings.
Our study is limited by the retrospective nature of the compar-
isons of pregnancy outcome. However, the cohort size is large, and
preterm delivery rates for each suture material were similar at each
of the five centers. The size of the prospective study was limited by
practicalities and cost of intensive multiple investigations; however,
the experimental data provide supporting evidence for the mecha-
nism of poorer outcomes in patients treated with braided suture
cerclage. Analysis of the vaginal microbiome was undertaken using
three alternate approaches. We primarily used a genera-based clas-
sification of normal, intermediate, and severe dysbiosis, which de-
monstrated that the principal effect of braided cerclage is to reduce
lactobacillus numbers and induce vaginal dysbiosis. We next
classified samples at the species level into five previously described
CSTs; however, this analysis was limited to the consideration of only
one dysbiotic group. Therefore, an alternate species-level classification
considering two levels of dysbiosis (intermediate and severe) was also
undertaken.

play between braided suture, increased cervical vascularity, and vaginal micro-
bial dysbiosis.

that are important for reproductive health outcomes. Vaginal dysbio-
sis associated with braided cerclage insertion was characterized by
reduced Lactobacillus species and increased diversity and enrichment
of bacteria associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including
Peptoniphilus harei (38), and species of Bacteriodes (38, 39), Prevotella
(40), and Clostridium (41). However, it is recognized that sequencing
of specific hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene can result in
underrepresentation of key vaginal microbiota such as G. vaginalis,
which, together with A. vaginae, is characteristic of BV (42, 43),
a condition associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes
including pelvic inflammatory disease (44), HIV transmission (45),
and PTB (46). Using targeted qPCR, we showed that dysbiosis as-
sociated with braided cerclage insertion may involve increased
abundance of G. vaginalis. The virulence of G. vaginalis is thought
to relate to its biofilm-producing capacity and adherence to vaginal
epithelial cells (42, 47). It is possible that such characteristics may
promote biofilm formation on the surface of cerclage suture material,
and this should be examined in future studies. Other bacteria clinically
associated with adverse pregnancy outcome include Streptococcus
agalactiae (group B streptococcus) and E. coli. However, we did not
observe any changes in the amounts of S. agalactiae. E. coli was not
detected in our data set, but this may reflect a limitation of the primer
set used for 16S rRNA sequencing (48, 49).
Increased bacterial diversity in the vagina corresponded to the
induction of a proinflammatory cytokine profile in cervicovaginal
fluid involving known mediators of cervical vascular remodeling,
including IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a (50–52). Concentrations
of MMP-1, a matrix metalloproteinase central to collagenous remod-
eling before PTB (53, 54), were also increased after insertion of
braided cerclage. Increased cervical vascularity occurs before term
parturition (28, 55), and an association between increased cytokine
excretion and cervical angiogenesis, vasodilation, and vascular per-
meability has been previously described (56). Consistent with a role
in untimely cervical remodeling before PTB, increased cervical vas-
cularity was observed as early as 4 weeks after insertion in women
receiving a braided cerclage. Our study therefore provides a human
model for understanding how pregnant host-vaginal microbial inter-
actions may underpin poor pregnancy outcomes. Cerclage-induced
inflammation resulting in premature weakening of the cervix could
also provide a mechanism for high rates of intrauterine death in
women receiving a braided cerclage, because in utero exposure of
the fetus to elevated concentrations of circulating proinflammatory
cytokines is known to associate with fetal brain injury (57, 58) and
stillbirth (59–61).
In summary, our data provide evidence that cervical cerclage
using braided suture associates with increased rates of PTB and
nonviable pregnancy. Promotion of vaginal bacterial dysbiosis after
insertion of braided suture material likely contributes to these ad-
verse pregnancy outcomes through activation of local tissue inflam-
mation and premature cervical remodeling. Because monofilament
suture has minimal impact on the host microbiome or inflamma-
tion in pregnancy and associates with improved pregnancy outcome,
we advocate its use for cervical cerclage. Further clinical trials addres-
sing the impact of cerclage suture material, powered to assess out-
comes of PTB, neonatal morbidity, and mortality, are therefore
urgently required.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was approved by the National Health Service (NHS) Na-
tional Research Ethics Service Committee London–City & East (REC
12/LO/2003), and all participants provided written informed consent.
Study design
We initially performed a retrospective data collection to assess out-
comes of cervical cerclages in singleton pregnancies considered at
risk of PTB over a 10-year period between January 2003 and 2013
across five UK hospitals in London, Cambridge, and Birmingham.
Cases were identified from operating theater logs, and all case notes
were reviewed where possible. Details regarding cerclage suture in-
sertion, suture material used, outcomes of PTB (between 16+0 and
36+6 weeks’ gestation), and nonviable birth (stillbirth or miscarriage,
>16+0 weeks’ gestation) were collected. Other metadata collected in-
cluded maternal age, parity, previous spontaneous PTB/midtrimester
miscarriage, indication for cerclage (ultrasound indicated or elective),
and CL at cerclage insertion.
After this, we prospectively recruited pregnant women at risk of
PTB with sonographic indications for cervical cerclage at preterm
surveillance clinics from January 2013 to August 2014 at a single
London site (Queen Charlotte’s and Chelsea Hospital). Inclusion
criteria were pregnant women with history of spontaneous PTB
(<37+0 weeks) and a CL measurement below the 10th centile
(≤25 mm) on transvaginal scan at ≤23+6 weeks’ gestation in the index
pregnancy. A normally distributed CL range not associated with PTB
risk is typically 35 ± 8.3 mm (means ± SD) (62).
Exclusion criteria included multiple pregnancy, previous iatrogenic
PTBs, HIV-positive status, and sexual intercourse or vaginal bleeding
in the previous 48 hours. Eligible women were randomized to either
braided Mersilene (n = 25) or monofilament Ethilon (n = 24) cerclage
suture material. The same obstetrician performed the procedure using
the MacDonald technique (63). Participants were recruited before
cerclage insertion and followed up longitudinally at 4, 8, 12, and
16 weeks after insertion. At each time point, cervicovaginal fluid
was sampled from the posterior fornix under direct visualization using
two swabs for later 16S rRNA gene sequencing and cytokine analysis:
a BBL CultureSwab MaxV Liquid Amies swab (Becton, Dickinson and
Company) and a Transwab MW170 with rayon bud type (Medical
Wire & Equipment), respectively. Both swabs were immediately placed
on ice and snap-frozen at −80°C. A transvaginal ultrasound scan was
then immediately performed to assess cervical vascularization in the
dorsal lithotomy position with an empty bladder, taking care to avoid
undue pressure on the cervix.
DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing
DNA extraction from the BBL CultureSwab was performed as pre-
viously described (6). Integrity of the extracted bacterial DNA was
confirmed by PCR amplification using universal forward and re-
verse primers (6). The V1-V3 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes
were amplified for sequencing using a forward and reverse fusion
primer. The forward primer was constructed with the Illumina i5
adapter (5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-3′), an

 8–base pair (bp) bar code, a primer pad (forward, 5′-TATGGTAATT-
3′), and the 28F primer (5′-GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCAG-3′) (64).
The reverse fusion primer consisted of the Illumina i7 adapter (5′-
CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-3′), an 8-bp bar code, a
primer pad (reverse, 5′-AGTCAGTCAG-3′), and the 519R primer
(5′-GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG-3′). Sequencing was performed
on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc.) at Research and
Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX, USA). Resulting sequence reads
were analyzed using the MiSeq SOP Pipeline of the Mothur
package (65), which is designed to analyze a multiplexed set of
samples. Sequence alignment was performed using the Silva bacte-
rial database (www.arb-silva.de/), and classification of sequences
was undertaken using the RDP (Ribosomal Database Project)
database reference sequence files and the Wang method (66). Op-
erational taxonomic unit taxonomies (phylum to genus) were
determined using the RDP MultiClassifier script. Species-level taxo-
nomies were determined using USEARCH with 16S rRNA gene se-
quences from the cultured representatives from the RDP database
(67). Sequence alignment data describing the capacity of the V1-
V3 amplicons to discriminate Lactobacillus spp. are provided in ta-
ble S8 and fig. S8. Data were resampled and normalized to the lowest
read count in Mothur (n = 689).
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
Targeted qPCR was carried out to detect 16S rRNA genes from A.
vaginae and G. vaginalis. The assays were SYBR Green–based and
performed on Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus. PCR mixes are as
follows: 1× SYBR Green JumpStart Taq Ready Mix (Sigma-Aldrich),
5 ml of bacterial DNA isolated from the vaginal swabs, and 0.8 mM fi-
nal concentration of forward and reverse primers. Oligonucleotide prim-
ers used for A. vaginae were 5′-TAGGCGGTTTGTTAGGTCAGGA-3′
(forward) and 5′-CCTACCAGACTCAAGCCTGC-3′ (reverse) (68),
and for G. vaginalis were 5′-GGAAACGGGTGGTAATGCTGG-3′
(forward) and 5′-CGAAGCCTAGGTGGGCCATT-3′ (reverse) (69).
Thermocycle profile was 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles at
95°C for 15s and 65°C for 1 min. For both assays, vaginal samples
and corresponding standards (A. vaginae and G. vaginalis DNA) were
run in duplicates, and mean numbers were used to calculate 16S rRNA
gene copies per 5 ml of vaginal DNA.
In vitro adhesion assay
Propensity of bacteria to adhere to braided and monofilament su-
ture material was assessed using an in vitro adhesion assay (70). Brief-
ly, 1-cm segments of sterile braided Mersilene or monofilament
Ethilon were prepared with a sterile blade and tweezers. Suture frag-
ments were placed into a sterile screw-capped tube and incubated with
1 ml of 100% ethanol for 1 hour at room temperature. Fragments were
washed three times using 1 ml of sterile water before inoculation with
E. coli (Nissle 1917) using LB and LB plates or L. jensenii (Cultech
Ltd.) using MRS broth and MRS plates.
For each bacterial isolate, we tested the following groups: inocu-
lated Mersilene thread fragments (n = 3), uninoculated Mersilene
thread fragment (sterility control, n = 1), inoculated Ethilon thread
fragments (n = 3), and uninoculated Ethilon thread fragment (ste-
rility control, n = 1). An overnight bacterial culture was centrifuged
at 3000g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Cell pellets
were resuspended in fresh broth to a final concentration of 107 CFU/ml,
and 1 ml of this cell suspension was added to each of the suture frag-
ments. For sterility controls, 1 ml of sterile broth was added to an un-
inoculated Mersilene and Ethilon thread fragment. Suture thread
fragments were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours before being washed
three times with sterile PBS and transferred into tubes containing
1 ml of sterile PBS. Each tube was vortexed three times for 30 s to de-
tach bacterial cells. The cell suspension was vigorously passed through a
25-gauge needle 10 times to break up cell clumps. Aliquots of 100 ml
were collected from the cell suspension and used for colony counts
on LB or MRS agar plates. After incubation, we used plate colony
counts to calculate the CFU/ml of cell suspension. Thread fragment
length was accurately measured after cell suspension plating to cal-
culate CFU/cm.
Cytokine analysis
The Transwab cervicovaginal fluid samples were thawed on ice and
resuspended in 350 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution with
protease inhibitor (5 ml/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). The suspension was
centrifuged at 3000g for 2 min, and the supernatant was collected
into a new microcentrifuge tube before repeating the centrifugation
step to ensure removal of any cellular debris. Cell-free supernatants
were analyzed by Human Magnetic Luminex Screening Assay (15 plex)
(Luminex Corporation) with a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad Labora-
tories Ltd.). Analyte-specific Luminex Screening Assays were per-
formed for 15 analytes: IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, G-CSF,
GM-CSF, MCP-1, TNF-a, IFN-g, CCL5 (chemokine ligand 5), VEGF,
ICAM-1, and MMP-1. Analytes were selected according to evidence
of involvement in inflammatory change related to PTB, cervical
ripening, and angiogenesis. Samples were analyzed on 96-well plates
at two dilutions (1:1 and 1:50) optimized for detection of analytes
within the range of the standards as specified by Luminex human pre-
mixed analyte kit.
Cervical vascularization assessment
Voluson E ultrasound (GE Healthcare) in 3D/4D mode with medium
persistence, high sensitivity, and normal line density was used for
transvaginal cervical vascular assessment. A sagittal plane of volume
acquisition, set at 90°, was analyzed using Virtual Organ Computer-
Aided Analysis software program (GE Medical Systems) (28). The
“histogram facility” of the software was used to calculate the VI within
the defined volume.
Statistical analysis
Assessment of differences in outcomes of viability and PTB between
cerclage suture material groups (braided versus monofilament) was
performed using the Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and
Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. We used a linear mixed-
effects model incorporating suture material group, maternal age,
parity, previous PTB, and hospital location as fixed-effects and ethnic-
ity (Asian, Black, or Caucasian) as a random effect to compare braided
versus monofilament suture material for the two primary outcomes
(viability and PTB). The contributions of fixed-effects terms (P value
and F statistics) were calculated using the ANOVA with Satterthwaite
approximation for degrees of freedom.
Examination of statistical differences between vaginal microbiota
was performed at bacterial genera and species levels using the Statis-
tical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles software package (71). Ward’s
linkage hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) of bacterial genera was
performed using a clustering density threshold of 0.75. Samples were

 classified according to the percentage of Lactobacillus spp. reads as
a proportion of the total number of reads per sample into the
following groups: normal (>90% Lactobacillus spp.), intermediate
(30 to 90% Lactobacillus spp.), or dysbiotic (<30% Lactobacillus spp.).
Bacterial species data were classified into CSTs as described by Ra-
vel et al. (25): CST I (Lactobacillus crispatus), CST II (Lactobacillus
gasseri), CST III (L. iners), CST IV (mixed bacterial species), and CST
V (L. jensenii). To identify potential associations between suture
material and differing degrees of dysbiosis, an alternative classifi-
cation of the species data was performed as described by Borgdorff
et al. (26), grouping bacteria into communities characterized by
healthy Lactobacillus spp. dominance, L. iners, or moderate or severe
dysbiosis.
The effects of suture material and time from cerclage insertion on
bacterial genera, number of species observed, and a diversity were as-
sessed using one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Dunn’s mul-
tiple comparisons test where appropriate.
The LEfSe method (27) characterized differentially abundant tax-
onomic features of the two suture materials before and 4 weeks after
cerclage insertion. An a value of 0.01 was used for factorial Kruskal-
Wallis test between classes, and a threshold of 3.0 was used for loga-
rithmic LDA score for discriminative features.
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared cytokine analyte con-
centrations before and 4 weeks after cerclage insertion. The Mann-
Whitney test was used to test for differences among suture material
types. Analyte expression was classified according to the corre-
sponding microenvironments (Fig. 1C), and the Mann-Whitney
test compared cytokine expression in the presence of a normal or
dysbiotic microbiome.
Cervical vascularization was compared according to suture ma-
terial from the time of cerclage insertion and as a function of the
corresponding bacterial classification, using Kruskal-Wallis test
and ANOVA multiple comparison analyses where appropriate.
We used linear regression to assess for correlations between cervi-
cal vascularity, the number of observed species, and Shannon index
of a diversity, according to suture material.
