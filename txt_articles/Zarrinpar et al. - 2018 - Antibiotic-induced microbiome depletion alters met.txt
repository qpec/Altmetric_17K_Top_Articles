Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion (AIMD) has been used frequently to study the role
of the gut microbiome in pathological conditions. However, unlike germ-free mice, the effects
of AIMD on host metabolism remain incompletely understood. Here we show the effects of
AIMD to elucidate its effects on gut homeostasis, luminal signaling, and metabolism. We
demonstrate that AIMD, which decreases luminal Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes species,
decreases baseline serum glucose levels, reduces glucose surge in a tolerance test, and
improves insulin sensitivity without altering adiposity. These changes occur in the setting of
decreased luminal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially butyrate, and the secondary
bile acid pool, which affects whole-body bile acid metabolism. In mice, AIMD alters cecal
gene expression and gut glucagon-like peptide 1 signaling. Extensive tissue remodeling and
decreased availability of SCFAs shift colonocyte metabolism toward glucose utilization. We
suggest that AIMD alters glucose homeostasis by potentially shifting colonocyte energy
utilization from SCFAs to glucose.

ecently, antibiotic-induced microbiome-depleted (AIMD)
mice, where luminal bacteria are reduced with the
administration of four or more broad-spectrum antibiotics
through gavage or drinking water, have been used in conjunction
with, or sometimes instead of, germ-free (GF) mice to investigate
the role of the gut microbiome in some pathological conditions1–
3. The metabolic effects of the absence of microbiota in GF mice
have been well characterized—for example, change in the luminal
and serum bile acid (BA) pool, increased incretin release,
decreased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) availability, and altered
glucose homeostasis4–6. However, the effects of AIMD on the
metabolic homeostasis of mice is unknown. Host transcriptomic
studies in the gut of GF and AIMD mice show gene expression
patterns that are distinct, suggesting that their metabolic phy-
siology may be different7. With a better understanding of the
effects of AIMD on host physiology, AIMD mice can be more
effectively used in experiments investigating the role of the gut
microbiome.
The consequences of low-dose antibiotic treatment aimed at
inducing dysbiosis by decreasing diversity of the microbiome
have been well documented8–10. These protocols have led to
hyperglycemia,
increased
adiposity,
and
insulin
resistance.
However, the effects of an acute and dramatic depletion of the
microbiome, as in AIMD, on metabolic homeostasis are not yet
well characterized and can have paradoxical effects. For example,
intestinal microbes are responsible for additional calorie extrac-
tion through the fermentation of indigestible carbohydrate into
SCFAs11. Thus, a depleted microbiome could decrease the
number of calories available for absorption and induce a hypo-
glycemic state similar to what is described in GF mice5. In fact,
antibiotic-treated mice have decreased luminal SCFAs4. However,
a microbiome that is deficient in butyrate-producing microbiota
is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D)12,13. There is some evi-
dence that butyrate-producing microbiota and butyrate itself are
protective against T2D14,15. Furthermore, by affecting luminal
SCFAs, intestinal microbiota can modulate intestinal incretin
excretion, and hence, apply another influence on glucose
regulation4.
AIMD can also affect metabolic homeostasis by altering the BA
pool. BAs can affect host metabolism by signaling through the
farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G-protein-coupled BA receptor
(TGR5)6,16,17. Intestinal microbiota can deconjugate BAs and
convert primary BAs into secondary ones. Relative reduction of
secondary BAs to primary BAs is associated with insulin resis-
tance18. However, one of the most potent FXR antagonists is
tauro-β-muricholic acid (TbMCA) which is deconjugated by bile
salt hydrolases (BSHs) in intestinal bacteria. Suppression of BSH
can lead to protection against obesity and improved insulin
sensitivity17. Since AIMD reduces bacteria with BSH, it could also
have a protective effect and improve insulin sensitivity.
Earlier mouse studies show that in cases of diet—or genetically
induced obesity, AIMD can protect against dysmetabolism19–22.
Furthermore, altered incretin signaling and BA signaling have
been studied in GF mice4,6. However, AIMD mice are different
from GF mice in three ways: (a) AIMD mice do not have com-
plete depletion of their gut microbiome, (b) AIMD has normal
development of immune and homeostatic regulatory system, and
(c) antibiotics themselves have a direct effect on host homeostasis.
If probiotics, prebiotics, or selective bacterial species targeting are
used as therapeutic approaches for diseases, initial depletion of
the microbiome by antibiotics is necessary to allow the recon-
stitution of the microbiota with selective species. Knowing the
physiological effects of AIMD to normal metabolism is a pre-
requisite for implementing these potential therapies.
In these studies, we aim to investigate the effects of microbiome
depletion on metabolism by performing AIMD in normal-chow
fed, wild-type mice to understand its effects on host metabolism.
The microbiome of AIMD mice is depleted of all major bacterial
phyla except Proteobacteria, as evidenced by negative stool
cultures, decrease in stool DNA, and engorgement of the
cecum19–23. Our results show that AIMD mice have improved
glycemic levels and increased insulin sensitivity despite having the
same body weight, food consumption, and body composition.
These changes in glucose homeostasis are associated with altered
gut hormone release, serum and fecal BA pool, luminal SCFA
profile, intestinal gene expression, and intestinal and hepatic
glucose and BA metabolic pathways. AIMD reveals the deeply
intertwined relationship between the gut, the microbiome, and
glucose homeostasis.
Results
AIMD affects composition and function of the gut micro-
biome. Twelve-week-old mice were given twice daily (i.e., every
12 h) oral gavage of ampicillin, vancomycin, neomycin, metro-
nidazole, and amphotericin B (AIMD-treated group) or water
(vehicle-treated group)23. Stool cultures prepared from vehicle-
treated and AIMD-treated mice revealed far fewer colonies in the
AIMD group (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1A). The amount
of stool-extracted DNA was nearly 20-fold lower in the AIMD
mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 1B),
suggesting depletion of all luminal organisms. Finally, AIMD
resulted in a massive increase in cecal weight and size (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1C, D), as well as increase in stool output (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1E).
The pre-treatment microbiome of the mice was dominated by
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes species, as was the microbiome
from the vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 1b, d, Supplementary Fig. 1F,
and Supplementary Data 1). The microbiome of AIMD mice had
far fewer sequences from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes
phylum.
Instead,
the
microbiome
of
AIMD
mice
had
a
compositional shift to Proteobacteria (Fig. 1c, d, Supplementary
Fig. 1F, and Supplementary Data 1). These phylum level
differences are significant based on an analysis of composition
of microbiome (ANCOM) assessment, which uses log-ratio
analysis to improve inferences from microbiome compositional
survey data24. The pre-treatment and vehicle-treated mice shared
a majority of their OTUs, whereas the AIMD mice, which had
fewer OTUs, shared about a sixth of their OTUs with the other
two conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1G)
Principal coordinate analysis of UniFrac distances25 showed
the microbiomes of pre-treatment and vehicle-treated mice were
similar to each other, but the microbiome of AIMD mice was
quite distinct (Fig. 1e). Phylogenetic diversity (PD) whole-tree (a
measure of α-diversity) assessment of the three different groups
of microbiomes showed that the pre-treatment condition had the
greatest diversity, with a slight decrease in the vehicle-treated
mice and significant decrease in AIMD-treated mice (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1H, I). Another measure of diversity, UniFrac
distance, showed that within-group distances for AIMD was
significantly greater than that of pre-treatment and vehicle-
treated
conditions (Supplementary
Fig. 1J).
Between-group
UniFrac distances (β-diversity measure) showed that the AIMD
condition was equally distant from the pre-treatment and vehicle
conditions and the pre-treatment and vehicle conditions were
nearly as distant from each other as they were from members of
their own group (Supplementary Fig. 1J).
These compositional and diversity changes induced by AIMD
have functional implications. We used PICRUSt, a bioinformatics
tool designed to predict metagenomic functional content from
16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) surveys using known microbial
genomes as reference, to assess potential functional differences

 between the microbiomes of AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated
mice26. Many of the predicted functional differences were in
metabolic pathways (Supplementary Data 2). The lipid metabo-
lism
pathway,
including
secondary
BA
biosynthesis,
was
significantly
different
between
vehicle-treated
and
AIMD-
treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 1K). In summary, AIMD in
mice
consuming
a
normal-chow
diet-induced
microbiome
depletion, especially of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes species,
decreased microbial diversity, and altered the potential functional
capabilities of the microbiome.
AIMD improves glucose homeostasis. We then assessed the
effects of AIMD on glucose homeostasis. AIMD induced a lower
fasting blood glucose level compared to vehicle-treated mice
(Fig. 2a) after a 4-h fast or a 16-h fast. Glucose clearance was
much faster in AIMD mice, with glucose levels lower in the
AIMD group compared to the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2b).
The area under the curve (AUC) above baseline for AIMD mice
was less than half of that of vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2c). An
insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that AIMD mice had
increased sensitivity to insulin compared to vehicle-treated con-
trols
(Fig.
2d).
However,
fasting
insulin
levels
was
not
significantly different between AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 2e).
AIMD did not affect the weight of the mice (Fig. 2f and
Supplementary Fig. 2A). The cumulative food consumption was
also indistinguishable between the two groups (Fig. 2g and
Supplementary Fig. 2B). The body composition of AIMD mice
was similar to vehicle-treated mice, with the same amount of fat
and lean mass, but there was a change in tissue that could not be
characterized as being lean or fat (Fig. 2h and Supplementary
Fig. 2C, D). This difference is likely due to changes in cecal
content. Hence, AIMD resulted in a drop in fasting blood glucose,
increased glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity
despite unchanged serum insulin levels in the setting of
unchanged mouse body weight, food consumption, and adiposity.
AIMD alters luminal secondary metabolites. AIMD can affect
luminal secondary metabolites and gut signaling, which can affect
whole-body glucose homeostasis. AIMD led to a complete dis-
appearance of butyrate from the feces (Fig. 3a). AIMD mice also
had a significant decrease in the fecal concentration of propionic
acid when compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3a). Hence,
AIMD changes the SCFA pool, most notably by decreasing
butyrate to undetectable levels.

 AIMD has substantial effects on the luminal BA pool. Fecal
samples from AIMD mice had lower concentrations of many
primary BAs (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 1) and secondary
BAs (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 1). The ratio of primary to
secondary fecal BAs is more than 20-fold higher in AIMD mice
compared to vehicle-treated mice. Thus, AIMD is accompanied
by significant changes in luminal SCFA and BAs. These changes
confirm the functional predictions made by the PICRUSt analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 1K).
AIMD alters gut metabolic signaling. Since changes in luminal
secondary metabolites can alter intestinal homeostasis and gut
signaling, we assessed gut-released hormones and other meta-
bolically important hormones. First, we measured serum levels of
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insuli-
notropic peptide (GIP), which are incretins that can modulate
serum glucose levels. AIMD mice had a nearly 18-fold higher
total GLP-1 (Fig. 4a). In addition, blood collection on Ddp4
inhibitor-coated tubes revealed a higher fasted (Fig. 4b) and fed
(Fig. 4b) active GLP-1. Although fasting insulin levels were not
different, insulin significantly increased after re-feeding AIMD
mice (Supplementary Fig. 3A). This suggests that GLP-1 poten-
tiated insulin response after feeding.
In agreement with the observed increase in GLP-1, results from
cecal transcriptome analysis (Fig. 4c) show that the expression

 level of the proglucagon gene (Gcg), which encodes GLP-1, was
sevenfold higher in AIMD mice. In addition, the enzyme which
converts preglucagon to GLP-1 and GLP-2, proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 7 (Pcsk7) was elevated in AIMD mice.
Dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (Dpp4), the enzyme that degrades GLP-1,
was not different between AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice
(Supplementary Fig. 3B). Finally, the expression of genes for
other gut hormone that are co-secreted with GLP-1, including
protein YY and cholecystokinin were also upregulated in AIMD
mice (Supplementary Fig. 3B). GIP, on the other hand, was not
affected by AIMD (Fig. 4d).
We also measured other metabolically important hormones.
Ghrelin, a gut hormone released by the gut that affects appetite,
was not significantly different between vehicle and AIMD mice
(Fig. 4e). However, AIMD mice had significantly less leptin,
another hormone that regulates appetite (Fig. 4f). Finally, AIMD
mice had nearly twice the amount of glucagon in their serum
(Fig. 4g).
We further assessed whether these changes in GI hormones are
specific to AIMD mice or were also observed in GF mice. Since
GF mice used for these experiments were older, housed in a
different room, with a different vendor for their normal-chow
diet, and were not receiving twice daily gavage as an intervention,
we used conventionally raised brethren as controls. Similar to
AIMD mice, GF mice had elevated levels of GLP-1 compared to
their controls (Fig. 4h). Also similar to AIMD mice, GF mice did
not have significant differences in their fasting serum insulin
(Supplementary Fig. 3C) or GIP (Supplementary Fig. 3D).
However, unlike AIMD mice, there was no significant difference
between GF mice and their controls in serum glucagon
(Supplementary Fig. 3E) or serum leptin (Supplementary Fig. 3F).
In addition, unlike AIMD mice, GF mice had lower production of
ghrelin (Supplementary Fig. 3G).
We investigated whether the lower fasting blood glucose and
the increased glucose clearance seen in GTT were caused by high
levels of serum GLP-1. We used a high dose of Exendin-9 (Ex-9),
a potent GLP-1 receptor antagonist to reverse the effects of GLP-1
in AIMD mice (Fig. 4i). If GLP-1 is the sole cause of
hypoglycemia in AIMD mice, we would expect the GTT response
to be similar between vehicle-treated and AIMD mice after Ex-9
injection. Although Ex-9 increased the glycemic surge in AIMD
mice, it did not bring their oral glucose tolerate test (oGTT)
response to the same level as that of vehicle-treated mice who also
received the antagonist (Fig. 4j). In other words, the relative
incretin effect of GLP-1 appears to be similar between AIMD-
treated and vehicle-treated mice, which suggests that lower blood
glucose in AIMD mice is not solely caused by excessive GLP-1.
AIMD remodels cecal enterocyte transcriptome. The effect of
AIMD on luminal secondary metabolites and gut signaling sug-
gests that this treatment is also affecting intestinal homeostasis.
To further assess the effect of AIMD on the gut, we performed
cecal transcriptome analysis. AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated
mice cluster by treatment type in a principal component analysis
analysis (Fig. 5a). The AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated groups
had 6256 differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. 4A
and Supplementary Data 3). Ingenuity pathway analysis of these

 differentially expressed genes reveal that they are mainly involved
in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation
(Fig. 5b), which is consistent with the decrease in the main fuel of
cecal enterocytes, butyrate (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, changes in
cellular growth and proliferation, as well as cell death and survival
pathways (Fig. 5c), suggest colonic remodeling, which is con-
sistent with the larger cecum size observed in these mice (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1C, D).
AIMD affected gut inflammatory signaling by activating both
pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cascades. For example,
some pro-inflammatory transcripts were significantly higher in
AIMD mice (Tlr4, Tnfrs1a; Supplementary Fig. 4B). However,
other pro-inflammatory transcripts (e.g., interleukin-18 (IL-18);
Supplementary Fig. 4B) were significantly lower in AIMD mice, as
was an inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 (IL1rm;
Supplementary Fig. 4B). Hence, it is difficult to determine how
AIMD affects gut inflammatory pathways through transcriptomics
alone. In sum, changes in cecal gene expression suggest that
AIMD not only induces gut proliferation and alters inflammatory
signaling but also affects cecal enterocyte metabolism.
AIMD shifts cecal enterocyte metabolism. To better understand
the altered glucose homeostasis associated with AIMD, we
investigated the expression of genes involved in metabolic path-
ways. Most strikingly, AIMD leads to extensive reconfiguration of
the cecal enterocytes’ metabolism. The decrease in luminal
SCFAs, particularly of butyric acid (Fig. 3a) and BAs (Fig. 3b, c),
suggests difficulty in the absorption of fatty acids, the primary
source of nutrients for enterocytes. Accordingly, compared to
vehicle-treated mice, AIMD mice down-regulate genes involved
in fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 6a). A schematic of transcriptional
changes in the cecum is illustrated in Fig. 6b. There is a down-
regulation of fatty acid receptors and transporters such as free
fatty acid receptor 2 (Ffar2/Gpr41) and fatty acid-binding pro-
teins (e.g., Fabp2). SCFAs are imported into the mitochondria by
carnitine palmitoyltransferases (Cpt1a, Cpt2) and processed by
acyl-CoA synthetases (Acss1), both of which are downregulated
in AIMD mice. Similarly, all the enzymes of fatty acid β-oxidation
are downregulated in AIMD mice, including acyl-CoA dehy-
drogenases (Acadl, Acad8, Acad12), enoyl CoA hydratases
(Echdc2),
2,4-dienoyl
CoA
reductase
(Decr1,
Decr2),
hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (Hadh, Hadhb), and
acetyl CoA acyltransferase (Acaa1a, Acaa1b). A parsimonious
explanation of the consistent downregulation of β-oxidation
genes is that the enterocytes are not using SCFAs for cellular
metabolism.
Cecal enterocytes could be using SCFAs for energy storage
through lipogenesis. However, cecal gene expression profiling
again shows that this is not the case (Fig. 6a, b). AIMD mice have
a downregulation of fatty acid synthase (Fasn) compared to
vehicle-treated mice. There is also a downregulation of the
stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd1) which elongates palmitate, the
end product of fatty acid synthase complex, into oleate.
Furthermore, the upregulation of 3-oxoacid CoA transferase
(Oxct1) accompanied by a complementary downregulation in the
genes involved in ketogenesis, including acyl-CoA thioesterase
(Acot7) and HMG-CoA synthase (Hmgcs2), suggested increased
utilization of ketone bodies as an energy source.
Cecal transcriptome analysis indicates that anaerobic glycolysis
is upregulated in the enterocytes of AIMD mice (Fig. 6a, b). Out
of the ten enzymes in anaerobic glycolysis, eight were upregulated
in AIMD mice. AIMD have increased expression of hexokinase
(Hk2), phosphofructokinase (Pfkp), aldolase B (Aldob), phos-
phoglyceratekinase (Pgk1), phosphoglycerate mutase (Pgam1),
enolase (Eno1), pyruvate kinase (Pklr), and lactate dehydrogenase
(Ldha). Appropriately, transcription for genes in the reverse
pathway of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis (e.g., its rate-limiting

 enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) and its main
transcriptional regulator, CREB, regulated transcription coacti-
vator 2 (Crtc2)) are downregulated. Further analysis shows
upregulation of genes transporting sugars to the glycolysis
pathway (e.g., increased glycerol kinase (Gyk) and glycerol
phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd2)). These findings suggest that
the primary source of energy for enterocytes is now glucose
through
anaerobic
glycolysis,
with
less
reliance
on
the
mitochondria.
There are significant changes in the role of mitochondria in the
metabolism of enterocytes. The proportion of total reads that
map to mitochondrial chromosome M are reduced in AIMD
mice, suggesting a reduced number of mitochondria (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5A). Furthermore, mitochondrial cytochrome b and
some subunits of cytochrome c oxidase such as Cox6a1 (complex
IV)
expression
are
significantly
reduced
in
AIMD
mice
(Supplementary Fig. 5B). In agreement with increased utilization
of glucose for anaerobic glycolysis as the main source of energy
for enterocytes, expression of the sodium/potassium-transporting
ATPase is upregulated (Atp1b1) (Fig. 6a, b). In addition, the
sugar efflux transporter (Slc50a1) is downregulated, suggesting
that the enterocytes are preventing glucose export.
These
changes
in
intestinal
glucose
regulation
can
be
responsible for the observed differences in whole-body glucose
homeostasis in AIMD mice. Since the liver is the main regulator
in glucose homeostasis, we characterized the hepatic expression of
key glucose metabolic pathways using quantitative reverse
transcription
PCR
(qRT-PCR).
Unlike
enterocytes,
hepatic
gluconeogenesis is upregulated with an increase in pyruvate
carboxylase (Pcx) and its activator peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (Pgc1a), as well as
glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc; Fig. 6c). Conversely, glucokinase,
an enzyme in the glycolysis/reverse pathway, is downregulated.
These results suggest that the liver in AIMD mice is actively
producing more glucose. This is further confirmed by the
upregulation of hepatic glucose transporter 2 (Glut2/Slc2a2),
which is a facilitated transporter of glucose from the liver into the
blood. There was no difference in hepatic histology (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5C) or hepatic triglyceride load (Supplementary Fig. 5D)
between AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice. Transcripts
involved in lipid metabolism, such as Pparα (Supplementary
Fig. 5E) and Rev-erbα (Supplementary Fig. 5E), are not affected
by AIMD or secondary luminal metabolites.
In summary, examination of cecal transcriptomes reveals that
proliferative enterocytes shift their metabolic nutritional needs
away from SCFAs toward the utilization of glucose. The low
amount of luminal SCFAs likely leads to a downregulation of
fatty acid uptake, β-oxidation, and lipogenesis. Instead, there is an
upregulation of anaerobic glycolysis and downregulation of
gluconeogenesis and function of mitochondria. The upregulation
of anaerobic glycolysis is similar to a Warburg effect in the setting
of upregulated proliferation that correlates with high levels of
GLP-1 growth factors. Furthermore, hepatic gene expression
suggests that the liver responds to AIMD as though it is in
starvation, upregulating the expression of genes in gluconeogen-
esis, while downregulating glycolysis genes.
AIMD alters BA metabolism and potentiates GLP-1 response.
Since the luminal BA pool was quite different in AIMD compared
to vehicle-treated mice, we examined the cecal enterocytes
sequencing results for genes involved in BA processing (Fig. 7a).
The expression of the primary transporter for intestinal BA
uptake, Slc10a2/Ibat (also known as Asbt), is increased 16-fold in
AIMD mice compared to vehicle-treated controls. In addition,
organic solute transporter β (Slc51b/Ostb), a subunit of the Ost
basolateral transporter complex responsible for exporting BA
from enterocytes to the enterohepatic circulation system, is
increased 2.5-fold. Both transporters are activated by FXR, and
the luminal BA pool contains both FXR agonists (e.g., taurocholic
acid (TCA), cholic acid (CA)) and antagonists (e.g., TaMCA,
TbMCA). FXR transcription is significantly increased in AIMD
mice. In addition, FXR forms an obligate heterodimer with the
retinoid X receptor (RXRa) which is also upregulated in AIMD
mice. These changes suggest that FXR signaling in the gut is
actively increasing the uptake of BAs from the lumen.
Since cecal transcriptome analysis indicates that there is an
upregulation of BA reabsorption from the cecum, we assessed
whether the altered luminal BA pool resulted in differences in the
serum
BA pool. Serum samples
from AIMD mice have
significantly higher amounts of common primary BAs (Fig. 7b
and Supplementary Table 2). Serum secondary BAs remain
higher in samples collected from vehicle-treated mice compared
to those from AIMD mice (Fig. 7c and Supplementary Table 2).
The ratio of primary to secondary serum BAs is more than
tenfold higher in AIMD compared to vehicle-treated mice
(Supplementary Fig. 6A). Consistent with observations from
fecal BAs, CA and bMCA were significantly decreased in AIMD
mice (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Table 2). Furthermore,
there was nearly a twofold increase in TCA, a threefold
increase in TbMCA, and a threefold increase in TCDCA (Fig. 7b
and Supplementary Table 2). Despite altered serum and luminal
BA pool in AIMD mice, there was no significant difference
in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels (Supplementary
Fig. 6B, C).
Altered serum BA pool suggests altered BA metabolism in
hepatocytes. We assessed the expression level of key enzymes by
qRT-PCR in whole liver extracts of AIMD-treated and vehicle-
treated mice (Fig. 7d). AIMD-induced serum BA pool changes
coincide with increased expression of the primary basolateral
membrane BA transporter, liver BA transporter (Slc10a1/Lbat).
The primary BA increase did not affect the expression of FXR in
hepatocytes, but did affect the expression of its main target and
metabolic mediator, small heterodimer partner (Nr0b2/Shp). Shp
regulates BA synthesis by inhibiting cholesterol 7 α-hydoxylase
(Cyp7a1), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo synthesis of BAs
from cholesterol. As expected with downregulation of Shp, there
is a nearly threefold increase in the expression of Cyp7a1 in
hepatocytes.
Finally, we investigated whether the altered luminal BA pool
contributed to the altered glucose homeostasis and increased
GLP-1 observed in the AIMD mice. To assess this, we gavaged
12-week-old male wild-type C57BL/6 with TCA twice daily (i.e.,
every 12 h) for 4 days. TCA was selected since it was elevated in
AIMD condition, whereas other BAs were not. TCA-treated mice
had a significant increase in GLP-1 compared to vehicle-treated
controls (Fig. 7E) and a decrease in fasting blood glucose level
that trended toward significance (Supplementary Fig. 6D).
Compared to vehicle-gavaged controls, glucagon, insulin, leptin,
ghrelin, and GIP levels were unchanged in TCA-gavaged mice
(Supplementary Fig. 6E–I).
In summary, in response to the lower luminal BA concentra-
tion, cecal enterocytes in AIMD mice increase the expression of
FXR and upregulate BA transporters likely to conserve as much
BAs as possible. The transport of primary/conjugated BAs that
are FXR antagonists (e.g., TbMCA) into the serum in turn
suppresses hepatic FXR targets, such as Shp, which allows
Cyp7a1 to upregulate further BA synthesis. Finally, increasing
luminal primary BAs by oral gavage with TCA elevates serum
GLP-1, suggesting a potential mechanism by which altered
luminal BAs in AIMD mice could lead to altered glucose
homeostasis.

 Discussion
AIMD induces major changes in luminal secondary metabolites
including SCFAs and BAs that in turn affect gut signaling. By
depriving the colon of its main fuel source, butyrate, the enter-
ocytes appear to compensate by using glucose to meet their
metabolic needs. This affects whole-body glucose homeostasis by
lowering serum glucose, improving insulin sensitivity, and
increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis. These changes occur in the
setting of increased GLP-1 which likely results from increased
luminal primary BAs, such as TCA. In addition to glucose utili-
zation by the gut, AIMD causes the gut to selectively upregulate
BA absorption. At the whole-body level, there is an increase in
serum BAs that are antagonists to FXR, which increases de novo
synthesis of primary BAs in hepatocytes.
Our study confirms earlier studies that show that AIMD has a
significant impact on glucose homeostasis. Treatment of both
obese leptin-deficient (ob/ob) and diet-induced obesity (DIO)
mice with norfloxacin and ampicillin for 2 weeks improved
fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance20. DIO mice had
an increase in GLP-1 secretion in response to antibiotic treat-
ment21 and lower serum LPS19, which could affect glucose
homeostasis through alteration of the gut barrier function and
decreased endotoxemia27. More recent studies show that, similar
to GF mice, antibiotic treatment lowers blood glucose levels,

 increases insulin sensitivity, and lowers oGTT in normal-chow-
fed animals22,28. In addition, our results confirm previous studies
that showed decreased luminal SCFAs in GF and antibiotic-
treated mice affects Gcg expression4.
Our study adds to this body of knowledge by demonstrating
that chronic increased levels of GLP-1, a known intestinal growth
factor29, likely promotes colonic proliferation and remodeling
and slows intestinal transit. The increased energy demand by the
colon, in addition to the loss of its main fuel, butyrate, increases
the gut’s glucose utilization (i.e., anaerobic glycolysis). Previous
studies which investigated the effects of antibiotic administration
in GF mice and transplantation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in
GF mice show that both conditions decrease active mitochondria
and inhibit mitochondrial gene expression, which could be con-
tributing to increased epithelial cell death7. We have observed a
similar phenomenon where mitochondrial number and gene
expression are decreased in AIMD mice. This could also be
contributing to increased anaerobic glycolysis observed in AIMD
mice. Ultimately, this metabolic change in cecal enterocytes can
make the gut a glucose sink, with increased glucose requirements
that alter whole-body metabolic homeostasis. This may be a
unique process to the colon, since in microbiome-depleted states,
the jejunum, which does not use SCFAs as its primary source of
energy, decreases glycolysis30. High levels of GLP-1, as in AIMD
mice, likely slow intestinal transit4,31, though the metabolic effects
of this are incompletely understood. More recent studies of the
microbiome of the proximal GI tract and gut barrier permeability
independently play an important role in the host metabolic
homeostasis19,30,32. Focused studies in these two areas may be
necessary to appreciate the full effect of this intervention on host
metabolic homeostasis.
AIMD induces decreased fasting serum leptin levels without a
change in body adiposity. Besides body adiposity, a fed state (as
determined with high circulating glucose) and increased serum
insulin can both increase leptin release33. Although fasting insulin
is similar between AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice, there
is a significant difference between fasting and fed insulin in
AIMD mice who are also hypoglycemic, both of which could
explain decreased leptin in these mice. In addition, GLP-1 is
known to affect satiety and high levels of GLP-1 may inhibit
leptin release. Leptin is a known to be a potent stimulator of GLP-
1 secretion from L cells34,35. Because high levels of serum GLP-1
is a potent appetite suppressor in our AIMD mice, decrease in
serum leptin levels may be a response to help regulate food/
energy intake. Hence, the relationship between GLP-1 on adipose
tissue in general, and leptin release in particular, should be more
closely investigated.
In addition, AIMD had an impact on BA physiology. Although
both FXR agonists (e.g., TCA) and antagonists (e.g., TbMCA) are
elevated in the luminal BA pool, FXR expression, and its down-
stream targets (e.g. Ostb, Ibap) were upregulated in the cecum.
Furthermore, FXR activation in the gut suggests an increased
uptake of BAs, which is confirmed by the serum BA pool which is
more equivalent between AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice.
However, gut uptake disproportionately increases serum TbMCA,
a known FXR antagonist. In turn FXR activity is decreased in
hepatocytes. This is confirmed by lower expression of Shp, the
main target of FXR, and increased de novo BA synthesis by
Cyp7a1. Although TGR5 gene expression levels were not different
in the cecum of AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice, it is
likely
that
AIMD-induced
BA
changes
are
also
affecting
TGR5 signaling which could also influence glucose home-
ostasis36,37. AIMD also increases TUDCA, a BA with known
hepatoprotective properties that could also play a role in
decreasing inflammation38. Hence, AIMD-induced changes in BA
physiology could likely affect host metabolism through various
methods, most of which remain to be explored.
Studies using mouse models suggest that dysbiosis could con-
tribute
to
T2D
and
metabolic
diseases
through
multiple
mechanisms, including alteration of luminal SCFAs, especially
butyrate11, the stool and serum BA pool6,17, and the incretin
signaling39. Furthermore, both obesity and T2D are associated
with reduced microbial diversity in the gut lumen and/or feces40.
Treating T2D with AIMD is unlikely to be tolerable to patients,
nor acceptable to the medical community at large. In fact, short-
term use of a single antibiotic did not have any metabolic
effects41. Other studies investigating the effects of antibiotics on
glucose homeostasis have focused on the long-term consequences
and risk of T2D42. Nevertheless, AIMD mouse models are
important for understanding the role of the gut microbiome in
human glucose homeostasis. For example, current GLP-1 therapy
for the treatment of T2D involves subcutaneous injection of GLP-
1 receptor agonists or Dpp4 antagonists which is a barrier to their
use. Since AIMD studies show that serum GLP-1 levels can be
increased without an injection, understanding the mechanism by
which the microbiome can affect incretin release can help find an
oral agonist of incretin signaling.
Although AIMD mice may be preferable to GF mice in some
experiments due to their relatively preserved immune function,
normal development, and low cost, studies using AIMD should
interpret their results cautiously. An acute depletion of the
microbiome still has significant metabolic consequences. AIMD
perturbs dynamic fluctuations of the gut microbiome driven by
diet, genetics, and feeding rhythms, which are important for
intestinal homeostasis and host metabolism43,44. Though it is
unclear whether the metabolic consequences of AIMD are due to
the depletion of the microbiome or administration of antibiotics,
or combination thereof, it is likely that they will have a significant
impact on other host physiological processes.
Methods
AIMD and TCA gavage. The care and use of laboratory animals in our study was
approved by the Salk Institute IACUC committee, and we have complied with all
relevant ethical regulations. C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were housed in
barrier facility and were housed 3–4 mice per cage. They were fed a normal-chow
diet (LabDiet 5001). After an acclimation period, 12-week-old male mice were
pseudorandomized into two groups. This pseudorandomization was based on the
initial weight of the mice; in the end, the mean and standard deviation of the
weight of the mice was the same between the two groups. One group of mice were
given oral gavage of antibiotics (AIMD-treated group) or water (vehicle-treated
group) every 12 h. The antibiotic cocktail was comprised of four antibiotics and
one antifungal (ampicillin (100 mg/kg, Amresco Inc.), vancomycin (50 mg/kg,
Amresco Inc.), metronidazole (100 mg/kg, MP Biomedicals), neomycin (100 mg/
kg, Amresco Inc.), amphotericin B (1 mg/kg, Amresco Inc.)). Amphotericin B was
added to prevent fungal overgrowth or opportunistic infections. The other group of
mice received water. This protocol was maintained for different length of time (30,
19, and 13 days) leading to identical phenotypic results. This cocktail was made
fresh every 36 h. Previous studies show that this method of antibiotic adminis-
tration is the most effective in depleting the microbiome with minimal effects on
the morbidity and mortality of the animal23. Experiments with once-daily dosing of
all the antibiotics, or using each antibiotic in the cocktail individually did not
induce hypoglycemia, or microbiome depletion which replicated previous
findings23.
For the TCA gavage experiment, 12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson
laboratories) were given oral gavage of TCA (400 mg/kg, 4 days, Sigma-Aldrich)
every 12 h. TCA solution was prepared fresh daily.
Stool culture measurement. To assess microbiome depletion, fresh fecal samples
were collected in pre-weighed tubes containing 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and their weights measured. Samples were thoroughly vortexed and diluted
with PBS to 1:4. Fecal samples for AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice were
collected 13 days after gavage initiation. Equal concentrations of stool diluent from
AIMD-treated, vehicle-treated, and blanks were placed on LB agar plates and
incubated for 7 days. One vehicle-treated sample that contained 1006 colonies was
excluded from further analysis since it was an outlier.

 Glucose and ITTs. Glucose tolerance assays were performed on fasted mice (16 h,
paper bedding) by monitoring glucose levels after a glucose bolus (1 g/kg of body
weight (BW)) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection or gavage as indicated 2 weeks after
gavage initiation. For insulin tolerance, mice were fasted (16 h) and injected IP with
insulin (0.5 U/kg BW). Glucose concentration was measured from the tail using a
OneTouch Ultra glucometer. For the GLP-1 antagonist study, Ex-9 (250 nmol/kg
body weight, Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.9% saline (vehicle control) was injected IP 20
min prior to the glucose bolus.
Body weight and food consumption. BW and food consumption were monitored
weekly during the acclimation period and every 2–4 days after the start of the
antibiotics/vehicle gavage.
Body composition. Whole-body composition was determined using the EchoMRI-
100H analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instruction prior to mice being
euthanized (i.e., day 30 for the first cohort and day 19 for the second cohort).
Stool weight. Approximately 2 weeks after gavage initiation, individual animals
were placed in clean cages for 24 h. All feces were collected and weighed.
Cecum weight. Mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed
by decapitation. Each cecum was carefully dissected out and weight was deter-
mined using a precision scale. This experiment was performed in the second cohort
(i.e., day 19 after gavage initiation).
Germ-free mice and serum collection. Germ-free C57BL/6 mice were bred and
maintained in sterile semi-flexible isolators and screened for bacterial, viral, and
fungal contamination45. Mice were fed autoclaved chow (LabDiet 5010). Con-
ventionalized brethren in the same facility and diet were used as controls. For
serum collection, germ-free mice were fasted for 6 h and blood was collected by
cheek bleeding using a sterile lancet. Blood was centrifuged in BD Microtainer® at
6000 rpm for 20 min to isolate the serum.
Short-chain fatty acids. SCFA concentration in the feces was determined by gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry by the AFNS Chromatography Facility at the
University of Alberta (http://afns-labs.ualberta.ca/Central-Labs-Chromatography).
Bile acids. BA quantification was performed by the metabolomics core services at
the University of Michigan from fecal samples collected from the first cohort of
mice (approximately 3 weeks after gavage). BAs were extracted from feces (50 mg)
using a two-step solvent extraction. Supernatants were combined, dried, and
resuspended for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry separation by reversed
phase liquid chromatography. Results were quantified using standard curves of
authentic standards. Data were averaged across samples.
Histology. Sections (6 μm) of formalin-fixed liver tissue attained from the first
cohort of mice (i.e., 30 days after gavage initiation) were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin.
Liver triglycerides. Liver powder obtained from the first cohort of mice (i.e.,
30 days after gavage initiation) was homogenized in isopropanol and triglyceride
concentration was measured using an enzymatic assay (Triglycerides LiquiColor,
Stanbio) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Data are shown normalized to liver
weight.
Blood collection and serum biomarker measurements. Blood was collected from
fasted (4–16 h) or re-fed animals (15 min to 1 h). Re-feeding was performed by
injecting a bolus of glucose (1 g/kg of BW) IP or by oral gavage as indicated. For
active GLP-1 measurement, blood was collected on Dpp4 inhibitor-coated tubes
(BD P700). Serum glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels were assessed using
Infinity reagents (Thermo Scientific) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Serum
endocrine panel (ghrelin, GIP, GLP-1, glucagon, insulin, leptin) was performed
using the Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Diabetes 8-Plex Assay (Bio-Rad) as per the manu-
facturer’s protocol.
Cecum transcriptomics. Ceca were collected from the first cohort of mice (i.e.,
30 days after gavage initiation), emptied of their content, and flash-frozen. Libraries
were prepped using Illumina’s TruSeq Stranded mRNA HT Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, total 1 µg RNA was poly-A selected, frag-
mented by metal-ion hydrolysis and then converted to complementary DNA
(cDNA) using SuperScript II. The cDNA was then end-repaired, adenylated, and
ligated with Illumina sequencing adapters. Finally, the libraries were enriched by
PCR amplification. Libraries were pulled into groups of 12 to a lane and sequenced
using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 50-bp single-read chemistry.
Sequencing reads were mapped to the GRCm38 genome with STAR46. Gene-
level read counts were generated using featureCounts47 and GENCODE gene
annotation. Analysis of differential expression was carried out using DESeq248,
with a two-factor design that accounted for time of sacrifice and antibiotic
treatment. Statistical significance was assessed using a negative binomial Wald test,
then corrected for multiple hypothesis testing with the Benjamini–Hochberg
method.
Principal component analysis was performed using the 500 genes with highest
variance across all samples. A heatmap was generated by selecting differentially
expressed genes associated with sugar or lipid metabolism. A regularized logarithm
transformation48 was applied to the gene-level read counts, which were then mean-
centered and hierarchically clustered for visualization.
Quantitative RT-PCR. RNA and cDNA were prepared andqRT-PCR performed49.
Absolute transcript expression was calculated using the standard curve method
(using three technical replicates), normalized to 18S RNA, actin and RPL10
expression, and finally median normalized group wise (n = 8/group).
Microbiome composition by 16S rRNA amplicon analysis. Fecal samples from
the same time point were collected from individually housed mice the day before
gavage treatment initiation. Likewise, before the end of the experiment fecal
samples were collected from individually housed AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated
mice. Stool were frozen until DNA collection. The stool pellets were then weighed
and resuspended in PBS and DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini
Kit (Qiagen), precipitated, and washed with ethanol. Resulting DNA was resus-
pended in TE. 16S rRNA gene sequence tags, corresponding to the hypervariable
V3–V4 region, were generated using the MiSeq sequencing platform. The full-
length primer sequences are50: 16S amplicon PCR forward primer = 5′-TCGTC
GGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG; 16S
amplicon PCR reverse primer = 5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAA
GAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC.
The 9,584,677 total raw reads from Illumina MiSeq were quality controlled
using QIIME v1.9.1 with default parameters, followed by closed-reference OTU
clustering at 97% similarity level against the GreenGenes database (v13_8),
resulting 4,344,060 reads in total (average of 164,103 for NA, 164,989 for aNA, and
296,188 for pre-treatment). After rarefying the samples to the same sequencing
depth of 20,000 reads per sample, α-diversity, β-diversity, and differential OTU
abundance analyses were performed on the rarefied OTU table with QIIME and
ANCOM.
PICRUSt analysis. The functional profile of KEGG Orthology (KO) for each
sample was predicted from 16S rRNA amplicon data with PICRUSt. The predicted
KO abundances were collapsed to level 3 by grouping them into a higher level of
functional categorization.
Statistics. Most experiments had an n of 6–8 mice per group. Our previous
experience has shown that this number is sufficient to notice a 20% change between
groups43,49,51. AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice (two groups) comparisons
were done with unpaired t tests (serum measurements) or Mann–Whitney U test
(SCFA or BA measurements). Three-way comparisons (pre-treatment vs. AIMD
vs. vehicle) were done with Kruskal–Wallis test. To address the compositionality
problem inherent in sequencing data sets (i.e., 16S microbiome differences), we
performed ANCOM analysis24 to statistically test the differential abundance
between pre-treatment/vehicle group and AMID group. Statistical significance of
differential gene expression from RNA-sequencing data was assessed using a
negative binomial Wald test, and then corrected for multiple hypothesis testing
with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. No blinding was performed for these
experiments.
Data availability. 16S sequencing data is available in the European Bioinformatics
Institute (EBI) database with the ascension number ERP109010 and the Qiita
database under study ID 11785. Annotated 16S OTUs are located in Supplemen-
tary Data 1. PICRUSt results from our 16S sequencing results is located in Sup-
plementary Data 2. Cecal RNA-seq data is available at NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number GSE114818. Supplementary Data 3
contains the annotated sequences and differential expression of genes in our
conditions.
