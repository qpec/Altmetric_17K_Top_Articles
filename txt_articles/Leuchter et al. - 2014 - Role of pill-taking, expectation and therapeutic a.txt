 There has been significant debate in recent years about the
effectiveness of antidepressant medications. Meta-analyses suggest
that medication has modest benefits over placebo treatment in
clinical trials for the treatment of major depressive disorder
(MDD),1,2 at least for patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms.3
The limited difference detected between drug and placebo may be
a result of significant increases in placebo response rates in clinical
trials for MDD over the past three decades.4,5 Many factors have
been suggested to contribute to high placebo response rates in
people with depression, including interpersonal interaction1,5
and the strength of the therapeutic alliance with research
personnel,1,6 and expectations of either the efficacy of medication
in particular or treatment in general.2,6,7 We performed this study
to examine the effects of pill administration, interpersonal inter-
action and expectation on the placebo response in MDD.
Participants were randomly assigned to receive supportive care
alone or supportive care along with double-blind treatment with
antidepressant medication or placebo, in order to examine the
distinct contributions of interpersonal interaction and pill-taking
to symptom improvement in MDD. Participants’ expectations of
treatment efficacy generally, as well as of medication efficacy
specifically, were assessed on three occasions in the first weeks
of the study to determine whether expectations formed early in
the treatment process affect outcomes. We also examined the
effects
of
the
therapeutic
alliance
on
treatment
outcome.
Medication and treatment expectations, as well as the therapeutic
alliance, were examined as independent and additive predictors of
symptom improvement in the three treatment conditions.
Method
Participants
A total of 88 participants with MDD, aged 18–65, were recruited
through
community
advertisement
for
this
clinical
trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00200902). Participants were diagnosed
as having MDD and no other primary Axis I disorder using the
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI),8 had at least
moderate symptoms as measured by the 17-item Hamilton Rating
Scale for Depression (HRSD) with a score 5179 and were without
Axis II disorders that could interfere with their participation in the
trial. Users of illicit substances or psychotropic medications were
excluded via urine toxicology data. The UCLA Institutional
Review Board approved all procedures, and written consent was
obtained from all participants prior to participation.
Experimental procedures
At the baseline visit, participants gave consent and were screened
for eligibility. One week later, participants were randomised to one
of three treatment arms: supportive care alone (28% likelihood),

Role of pill-taking, expectation and therapeutic
alliance in the placebo response in clinical trials
for major depression

Background
Pill-taking, expectations and therapeutic alliance may account
for much of the benefit of medication and placebo treatment
for major depressive disorder (MDD).
Aims
To examine the effects of medication, placebo and
supportive care on treatment outcome, and the relationships
of expectations and therapeutic alliance to improvement.
Method
A total of 88 participants were randomised to 8 weeks of
treatment with supportive care alone or combined with
double-blind treatment with placebo or antidepressant
medication. Expectations of medication effectiveness, general
treatment effectiveness and therapeutic alliance were
measured (trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00200902).
Results
Medication or placebo plus supportive care were not
significantly different but had significantly better outcome
than supportive care alone. Therapeutic alliance predicted
response to medication and placebo; expectations of
medication effectiveness at enrolment predicted only
placebo response.
Conclusions
Pill treatment yielded better outcome than supportive care
alone. Medication expectations uniquely predicted placebo
treatment outcome and were formed by time of enrolment,
suggesting that they were shaped by prior experiences
outside the clinical trial.

 supportive care plus placebo (28% likelihood) or supportive
care plus medication (44% likelihood, divided equally among
medications venlafaxine XR, duloxetine or escitalopram) (Fig. 1).
The actual percentage of participants in each treatment arm could
be affected differently by individuals discontinuing treatment. At
study entry, participants were informed that they were most likely
to be randomised to double-blind treatment with supportive care
plus either medication or placebo, but were not informed of the
specific probabilities of any assignment. Supportive care was
initiated at the randomisation visit for all groups and consisted
of a 30 min session of interpersonal clinical interaction that was
repeated 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the initial visit. During these visits,
treatment providers assessed risk, side-effects and symptoms,
provided
support
and
encouragement,
but
refrained
from
engaging in problem-solving that might result in therapeutic
effects, as outlined in the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH) manual for pharmacological clinical management of
depression.10 Treatment providers who performed supportive care
in this study received specific training in this method and were
research coordinators (usually trained in nursing) with at least
5 years of experience in MDD treatment trials. All participants
had the same number and length of meetings with research
coordinators and physicians, regardless of treatment assignment.
Medication and placebo treatment both began with a single-blind
1-week
placebo
lead-in,
which
was
utilised
to
maintain
consistency with previous studies. This was followed by double-
blind administration of the assigned pill. No participants were
excluded based upon a response during the placebo lead-in.
Assessment instruments
Diagnoses were established using the MINI,8 and depression
severity was assessed each week of the study using the 17-item
HRSD.9 History of antidepressant use was determined by
structured interview, and was tabulated as a dichotomous variable
to indicate whether or not a participant had received treatment
with an antidepressant during the present or any previous
episode(s) of depression.
Participants’ expectations about treatment were assessed using
items from the Patient Attitudes and Expectations Form (PAEF).11
The PAEF contains two separate items that ask participants how
helpful they believe that medication in particular, and treatment
in
general,
would
be
in
ameliorating
their
symptoms
of
depression, with ratings on a Likert scale ranging from 1, ‘not
helpful’ to 7, ‘extremely helpful’. Expectations were measured early
in the study, at three time points 1 week apart: at the baseline
screening interview, at randomisation to a treatment arm (at
which point all patients assigned to pill-taking treatment arms
received placebo before beginning their assigned treatment), and
at the end of the 1-week placebo lead-in. These measures of
expectation therefore could be influenced by participation in the
trial, but not the pharmacological effects of current medication.
The California Pharmacotherapy Alliance Scale (CALPAS),12 a
measure associated with outcomes of antidepressant pharmaco-
therapy, was used to measure treatment provider and participants’
perceptions of: (a) participants’ commitment to treatment; (b)
participants’ working capacity; (c) treatment providers’ under-
standing and involvement; and (d) goal and working strategy
consensus between participant and treatment provider. Previous
work has shown the CALPAS to have good internal consistency
(Cronbach’s alpha (a) = 0.83).12 The CALPAS was measured at
baseline, randomisation, end of lead in, and weeks 4 and 8. This
report focuses on measurements at the first three time points, at
which both expectation and therapeutic alliance measurements
were available.
Data analysis
Significance level was set at P40.05. Analyses were conducted
using IBM SPSS version 21 and Stata12 for Mac. Demographic
and clinical characteristics were compared among the treatment
groups in the intent-to-treat (ITT) sample for baseline differences
using chi-squared, ANOVA, and t-tests as appropriate. Treatment
efficacy was compared across the three groups by examining the
percentage change in HRSD score from study entry to the final
visit 8 weeks later with a one-way ANOVA, using imputation
via last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF). In addition, rates
of response and remission were compared across the three
treatment groups, where response was defined as at least a 50%
decrease in HRSD score and remission was defined as a final
HRSD score 47.
The trajectories of change in symptoms across the three
conditions were compared using a mixed-effects model with
repeated measures. The change from baseline in HRSD score
measured at each week was entered as the outcome, with time,
treatment and the time6treatment interaction as predictors,
while covarying for baseline HRSD score. Pattern mixture
modelling13 was performed to determine whether drop-out
accounted for any differences in symptom change across time.

 Placebo response in clinical trials for major depression
Following the primary outcome analyses, a path analysis was
conducted to examine the relationship between early expectations
of medication and symptom change and potential moderation by
treatment assignment. Path analysis allows for the use of full
information maximum likelihood estimates of variable means,
which yields unbiased estimates of missing data under more
conditions than does list-wise deletion.14 Following the path
analysis, linear regression was used to examine the moderation
in more detail. Symptom change was regressed on expectations
within each treatment condition (antidepressant medication,
placebo), controlling for baseline symptom severity. Linear
regression models were also used to examine the relative
contributions of expectations and the therapeutic alliance to
symptom change within each treatment group.
A measurement model was constructed to assess whether the
subscales of the CALPAS represented the same construct over
time.
Latent
variable
analysis
was
used
to
examine
the
relationships between CALPAS subscales and outcome, as well as
the interaction between CALPAS subscales, treatment group and
outcome.
Results
Participant characteristics and clinical outcomes
in the ITT sample
There were no differences among the treatment groups in age,
gender, baseline severity of depression, history of antidepressant
medication treatment, average expectations of receiving benefit
from antidepressant medication across the three assessments
preceding randomisation, or any of the subscales of the CALPAS
(Table 1). Non-specific expectations of treatment, however, were
found to differ by treatment assignment (F(2) = 3.79, P50.05),
so that even prior to randomisation, participants later allocated
to the supportive care condition had lower expectations of
treatment (mean 3.17, 95% CI 2.76–3.57) compared with those
later assigned to placebo (mean 3.94, 95% CI 3.56–4.22). Because
of these baseline differences in general expectations of treatment,
analyses were limited to the measure of anticipated benefit from
antidepressant medication.
Participants assigned to supportive care alone were more likely
to discontinue treatment (w2(1) = 4.40, P50.05) and spent fewer
weeks in treatment (t(86) = 72.97, P50.01) compared with
participants across pill-taking groups. There was no significant
difference in drop-out rates or time in treatment between the
medication and placebo treatment groups (Table 2).
Efficacy and sensitivity assessment
Symptom change did not differ by medication type among those
receiving
antidepressant
medications
(F(2) = 0.11,
P= 0.90).
Medication data therefore were pooled for further analysis.
Patients assigned either to antidepressant medication or pill-
placebo in addition to supportive care had significantly better
symptom improvement (percentage change in HRSD score from
baseline to week 8) compared with supportive care alone
(F(2) = 9.62, P50.001) (Table 2). Post hoc Tukey tests showed that
the placebo (mean, 70.36, 95% CI 70.49 to 70.24) and
medication groups (mean, 70.46, 95% CI 70.57 to 70.35)
had significantly better outcomes than supportive care alone
(mean –0.05, 95% CI 70.21 to 0.10). Tukey tests showed no other
differences in outcome.
The efficacy analysis revealed that the reduction in HRSD
symptoms from baseline to week 8 was greater for participants
taking placebo and medication compared with those receiving
supportive care alone (w2(1) = 20.85, P50.0001 and w2(1) =
37.39, P50.0001, respectively) (Fig. 2). The change in HRSD
score over the course of the study was numerically but not
statistically significantly greater in the medication- than in the
placebo-treated group (w2(1) = 3.12, P= 0.08) (Table 2).
There were no significant differences in age (t(86) = 0.33,
P = 0.75), gender (w2(1) = 0.62, P= 0.43) or the patterns of
symptom change (w2(2) = 0.38, P= 0.83) between the full ITT
sample (n = 88) and study completers (n = 67) in any of the
three treatment groups, after controlling for baseline HRSD.
Participants who completed the study did not differ significantly
from those who dropped out in baseline medication expectations
(t(82) = 70.24, P = 0.81), treatment expectations (t(79) = 0.79,
P = 0.43) or HRSD score (t(82) = 0.28, P= 0.78), but had greater
commitment to treatment as measured by the CALPAS (t(69)
= –2.35, P<0.05). Because the ITT and completer samples were
comparable, we conducted the analyses examining the effects of
therapeutic alliance and treatment expectations on the completer
sample. This allowed us to assess the impact of expectation and
therapeutic alliance on placebo and active medication treatment
outcome in participants who underwent identical lengths of treat-
ment. Participants receiving only supportive care were excluded
from these analyses because of the low response and completion
rates in this group.

 Leuchter et al
Expectations and treatment outcome
Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed no change in participants’
expectations of medication in particular (F(2) = 0.24, P= 0.79)
or of treatment in general (F(2) = 0.66, P= 0.52) over the first 3
weeks of the study. Expectations therefore were averaged across
the three measurement time points to create two variables per
participant: average early expectations of treatment in general,
and
average
early
expectations
of
medication.
Participants
assigned to medication v. placebo did not differ in their average
medication expectations (t(52) = 71.00, P= 0.32) or in their
average
expectations
of
treatment
(mean,
2.11,
s.d.= 0.62,
t(50) = 71.67, P= 0.10).
Treatment condition was examined as a moderator of the
relationship
between
expectations
of
medication
and
the
percentage change in HRSD score by regressing the percentage
change in HRSD hierarchically on baseline HRSD, expectancy,
treatment condition, and the interaction between expectancy and
treatment condition. A significant relationship was found between
expectations of medication and the percentage change in HRSD
score over the course of the 8-week study (b = 70.18, s.e.= 0.06,
P50.01) and treatment assignment acted as a moderator of this
relationship (b = 0.16, s.e.= 0.08, P50.05) over and above the
effects
of
baseline
symptom
severity
(b = 0.00,
s.e.= 0.01,
P = 0.35). Linear regression models were used to explore the
moderation by treatment condition. The percentage change in
HRSD score was regressed on expectations of medication
separately for participants in the antidepressant and placebo treat-
ment arms. There was a significant relationship between medication
expectations and outcome in the placebo group, such that higher
expectations predicted a greaterdecrease in symptoms over and above
the effects of baseline symptom severity (b= 70.17, s.e.= 0.06,
P50.01). In the medication group, however, there was no
relationship between expectations of medication and the percentage
change in HRSD score (b= –0.01, s.e.= 70.04, P= 0.82) (Fig. 3).
Therapeutic alliance and treatment outcomes
Latent variable analysis showed that there was no change in the
relationship between CALPAS subscale ratings and outcomes over
time, and thus a single variable was used to represent the average
value of each CALPAS subscale. Of the four CALPAS subscales,
only the goal and working strategy consensus (GWSC) between
provider and participant predicted symptom change (b = 70.64,
P50.01),
whereas
participants’
commitment
to
treatment
(b = 70.11, s.e.= 0.14, P= 0.45), working capacity (b = 0.04,
s.e.= 0.11, P= 0.74), and view of the treatment provider’s under-
standing and involvement (b = 0.38, s.e.= 0.21, P= 0.07) were
not significant predictors. The GWSC ratings were significant
predictors of outcome for participants in both the placebo and
medication
groups
(b = 70.40,
P50.01,
and
b = 70.25,
P50.01, respectively).
Therapeutic alliance, expectations,
and treatment outcomes
When GWSC and mean expectations of medication were entered
as simultaneous predictors, along with HRSD, only GWSC
remained significant, so that greater consensus regarding the goals
and working strategy between practitioner and patient led to
greater decreases in HRSD (b = 70.25, P50.001). Based on this
initial finding in the overall sample, separate regressions were
conducted within each treatment group to determine the specific
effects of the goal and working strategy consensus on the
outcome of each treatment. Among participants receiving placebo,
expectations of medication and GWSC were each associated with
a percentage decrease in HRSD, whereas in the medication group,
only higher GWSC was associated with outcome (Table 3).
Discussion
Main findings
These results indicate that administration of either antidepressant
medication or placebo along with supportive care for the treatment
of MDD was superior to supportive care alone for amelioration of
depressive symptoms. Participants who received supportive care
alone were less likely to respond and more likely to discontinue
treatment earlier than those who also received a pill. There was
no significant difference, however, between the effectiveness of
the medication and placebo treatment conditions. These findings

 Placebo response in clinical trials for major depression
suggest that pill-taking adds significantly to the benefits of
supportive care for MDD, and further, that the benefits of
placebo treatment cannot be accounted for solely by supportive
interaction with research personnel. In fact, the strength of the
therapeutic alliance with research personnel was significantly
associated with the efficacy of both placebo and medication.
These
results
additionally
suggest
a
unique
role
for
participants’ medication expectations in engendering a placebo
response.
Higher
expectations
of
medication
effectiveness
predicted improvement in the placebo-treated group, in contrast
to general treatment expectations, which predicted response
to both placebo and medication. There was no change in
expectations of medication over the first 2 weeks of the trial for
either the medication or placebo groups, and no relationship
between expectations and participants’ ratings of the strength of
the
therapeutic
alliance.
Expectations
regarding
medication
effectiveness may therefore represent a construct that selectively
affects the likelihood of placebo response, and is unaffected by
processes that occur early in the clinical trial, or by the quality
of the therapeutic relationship.
Findings from other studies
One previous study reported that positive ‘global expectations’ of
improvement
were
associated
with
increased
likelihood
of
response to four treatment conditions (cognitive–behavioural
therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, imipramine with clinical
management, and placebo with clinical management) in a clinical
trial for MDD.7 These investigators did not report specifically on
medication expectations. In another study, positive expectations
of the effectiveness of an experimental antidepressant medication
were related to the likelihood of response to the drug.15 There was
no placebo control condition in that study, however, and
medication expectations may in fact have been predicting placebo
response.
Possible explanations for our findings
Placebo response has been characterised as a ‘non-specific’
response to treatment, in contrast to the presumably more specific
physiological response to treatment with medications or devices in
MDD.16,17
Participants’
medication
and
general
treatment
expectations were measured immediately upon entry into the
study and on two subsequent occasions in the first 2 weeks, and
were found not to change over time. These expectations could
have been shaped in part by the consent process, through which
participants were informed that they were more likely to receive
medication than any other treatment. This process was brief,
however, focused on written material explaining the risks and
benefits of medication, and did not vary significantly across
participants. It is therefore likely that positive medication
expectations in placebo responders were formed in large measure
prior to the study, measureable at time of entry to the study, and
stable
over
multiple
ratings.
Previous
meta-analyses
have
suggested that expectations created by participants’ knowledge
of a high likelihood of receiving medication were associated with
greater clinical improvement during placebo treatment18 and less

drug–placebo ‘separation’.19,20 One recent prospective study
showed that knowledge of the likelihood of receiving medication
affected both drug and placebo response rates,21 although another
meta-analysis concluded that response expectancies affect placebo
but not active medication treatment.22
Positive expectations towards antidepressant medications that
are formed prior to enrolment may reflect both an individual’s
past experience with direct exposure to medication(s) and the
influence of societal trends. Antidepressant medications were the
single most prescribed class of medication in 2011, with 264
million prescriptions filled and six of the ten most prescribed
drugs being antidepressants.23 Although placebo response rates
have increased over the past 30 years, there has been a roughly
commensurate increase in antidepressant medication response
rates.22 The widespread and increasing use of antidepressant
medication as well as the increase in placebo response rates may
reflect in part the influence of direct-to-consumer advertising for
antidepressant medications, which represents a large proportion of
the more than $10 billion annual direct-to-consumer advertising
expenditures.24,25 Direct-to-consumer advertising has been linked
to
increased
patient
expectations
for
the
effectiveness
of
medications26
and
increased
demand
for
antidepressants.27
Medication expectations, such as those that were related to
placebo response in our study, should be a focus for future studies,
both with regard to participants’ treatment experience and within
the larger social milieu.
Response expectancies also can be shaped by the therapeutic
alliance. Previous research has shown that expectations may
interact
with
the
therapeutic
alliance
in
a
manner
that
differentially affects response to placebo and medication.28,29 A
meta-analytic study found, however, that although there was a
therapeutic impact of more frequent visits in clinical trials for
MDD, both placebo and medication response rates increased
proportionally.30 This finding is consistent with the present study,
in which the strength of the alliance with treatment providers was
a significant predictor of response to both medication and placebo
treatment, unrelated to expectations, and did not differ between
the two pill-taking treatment conditions. It is important to note
that this report focuses on the therapeutic alliance at the time of
enrolment and shortly thereafter, at a time when it is less likely
that a strong relationship with the treatment provider had been
established. The nature of the interpersonal interaction at this
time probably reflects each participant’s baseline tendency to form
a relationship with a new provider, which may vary greatly among
individuals. For example, some people might tend to trust and
invest in medical providers early on (possibly followed by waning
enthusiasm for the relationship later on), whereas others may
build a relationship over time, moving from initial ambivalence
to deeper trust and involvement. The present results indicate that
this very early relationship with providers is associated with
differences in outcome, and future studies should examine how
the change in this relationship over time is related to treatment
response.
It is interesting that despite the significant effect of a therapeutic
alliance on treatment outcomes, the supportive care treatment
condition alone was significantly less effective than the two
treatment conditions that also involved pill administration. This
finding suggests limited benefits of a positive therapeutic alliance
in a clinical trial in the absence of pill administration. The
participants who were randomly assigned to supportive care
alone, however, had lower expectations of treatment in general
prior to randomisation than those assigned to the pill-taking
conditions. This lower baseline level of expectation makes it
difficult to draw any firm conclusions regarding the importance
of the therapeutic relationship in supportive care. The therapeutic
alliance, however, was unrelated to expectations of medication or
treatment, suggesting that other factors played a greater role in
shaping attitudes towards the clinical trial.
Limitations
The findings of this study should be interpreted within the context
of certain limitations. First, participants entering this study had a
strong preference for entering a treatment condition that involved
administration of a pill, as evidenced by the fact that the treatment
condition based on supportive care alone had a higher drop-out
rate and was notably less effective than the treatments involving
pill-taking. This finding may reflect general social attitudes
towards antidepressant medication, the sources of participant
recruitment, and other factors. Individuals entering this study
were aware that they might be assigned to a treatment condition
that did not involve the use of medication, and it is not certain
that they are representative of people with MDD who would enter
clinical
trials
for
MDD.
Future
studies
should
investigate
participants’ attitudes and expectations surrounding medication,
and how they are formed, in greater detail. Second, we detected
an effect of medication expectation but not general treatment
expectation on the response to placebo. It is possible that there
is a weaker effect of general treatment expectations on placebo
response in MDD and that our sample size was not sufficient to
detect this effect. Replication of this finding in a larger sample
would be useful. Finally, although a numerically higher percentage
of participants receiving medication in this study responded to
treatment than those receiving placebo, this difference was not
statistically significant. The failure to show significant separation
between drug and placebo is common in MDD clinical trials,
and underscores the importance of this line of investigation. It
is possible, however, that a study with a different design or that
enrolled more individuals who were more severely depressed,
and did show drug–placebo separation, might yield different
findings.
Implications
The results of this study extend previous findings regarding the
role of expectations and the therapeutic alliance in the placebo
response in MDD, and suggest that expectations formed externally
to the context of the treatment study are a significant determinant
of treatment outcome. Expectations of medication in particular
appear to be specifically involved in response to placebo, but
not medication, and appear to be stable throughout the first weeks
of
the
clinical
trial
when
treatment
assignment
is
being
determined. A variety of factors could help form an individual
participant’s expectations, including personality, health attitudes,
belief systems, societal factors, as well as previous experiences in
treatment.
Future
studies
should
systematically
investigate
whether these and other factors might interact with expectations
of medication to help engender the placebo response. Once these
factors are better understood, it may be possible to manage
medication expectations in clinical trials, prior to the start of
treatment, with the goal of better differentiating the effects of
placebo from those of antidepressant medication in randomised
clinical trials for MDD.
