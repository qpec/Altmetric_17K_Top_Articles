Multicellular aggregates of circulating tumor cells (CTC clusters)
are potent initiators of distant organ metastasis. However, it is
currently assumed that CTC clusters are too large to pass through
narrow vessels to reach these organs. Here, we present evidence
that challenges this assumption through the use of microfluidic
devices designed to mimic human capillary constrictions and CTC
clusters obtained from patient and cancer cell origins. Over 90% of
clusters containing up to 20 cells successfully traversed 5- to 10-μm
constrictions even in whole blood. Clusters rapidly and reversibly
reorganized into single-file chain-like geometries that substantially
reduced their hydrodynamic resistances. Xenotransplantation of hu-
man CTC clusters into zebrafish showed similar reorganization and
transit through capillary-sized vessels in vivo. Preliminary experiments
demonstrated that clusters could be disrupted during transit using
drugs that affected cellular interaction energies. These findings
suggest that CTC clusters may contribute a greater role to tumor
dissemination than previously believed and may point to strate-
gies for combating CTC cluster-initiated metastasis.

irculating tumor cells (CTCs) drive metastasis by dissemi-
nating from primary tumors to seed metastases in distant
organs. These rare cells may serve as prognostic/predictive can-
cer markers or may help identify potential therapeutic targets (1–
5). However, individual “singlet” CTCs may not be the strongest
initiators of secondary tumors. Aggregates containing two or more
CTCs (also known as circulating tumor microemboli; herein, CTC
clusters) have been known for decades to seed colonies with greater
efficiencies than individual CTCs (6–8). Recent data suggest that
clusters may have 50 times greater metastatic potential than indi-
vidual CTCs (9). The greater colonization efficiency of CTC clusters
may be due to a number of factors including protection against
anchorage-dependent apoptosis (5, 10), the cooperation of het-
erogeneous cell phenotypes within CTC clusters (11), and shielding
from assault by immune cells (2, 12). Beyond their role in metas-
tasis, CTC clusters may also serve as biomarkers for early detection
(13), as prognostic markers (5, 9), and may have utility for non-
invasively tracking changing drug susceptibilities in patients un-
dergoing treatment (14).
Despite their biological significance, the behavior of CTC clusters
in circulation is largely unexplored (3, 15). The current consensus is
that CTC clusters are incapable of transiting through capillaries
because of their large size and therefore immediately arrest in cir-
culation, leading to the rupture of vessel walls (2, 4, 15). This idea
has remained unchallenged for decades (16), despite the fact that
many groups have reported the isolation of CTC clusters, sometimes
containing up to 100 cells, from the peripheral blood of cancer pa-
tients (2, 5, 9–11, 17–19). Since blood is routinely drawn from the
venous circulation of the arm, it is unlikely that CTC clusters could
be consistently collected unless they passed through both pulmonary
capillary beds and finger capillaries at least once. Furthermore, CTC
clusters have been shown in animal models to exhibit circulating
half-lives on the order of minutes (9) and to seed metastases in
distant organs (20). Taken together, these observations suggest that
CTC clusters may possess the ability to traverse small vessels (Fig. 1A).
In this work, microfluidic constriction devices were engineered
with dimensions mimicking human capillaries to study the behavior
of CTC clusters within constrictions under physiological tempera-
ture and pressures. Although not perfect analogs of human capil-
laries, microchannel constrictions are advantageous for studying
CTC cluster behavior for a number of reasons: (i) devices can be
easily integrated with imaging systems permitting sensitive multi-
fluorescence analyses of cellular responses in real time; (ii) unlike
larger blood vessels, which are suitably modeled as tubes within
fluids, the mechanical properties of capillaries are better modeled
as tunnels within elastic solids (21); (iii) similar to other blood cells
(22), physical parameters such as pressure, constriction size, cell
elasticity, cell size, and strengths of intercellular adhesions likely
dominate the transit behavior of CTC clusters in circulation. Many
of these parameters can be precisely controlled in microfluidic
Significance
Metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer-related deaths and is
driven by tumor cells circulating in blood. However, it is believed
that only individual tumor cells can reach distant organs because
multicellular clusters are too large to pass through narrow capil-
laries. Here, we collected evidence by examining clusters in mi-
croscale devices, computational simulations, and animals, which
suggest that this assumption is incorrect, and that clusters may
transit through capillaries by unfolding into single-file chains. This
previously unidentified cell behavior may explain why previous
experiments reported that clusters were more efficient at seeding
metastases than equal numbers of single tumor cells, and has led
to a strategy that, if applied clinically, may reduce the incidence of
metastasis in patients.

 systems, and (iv) microfluidic constrictions of this sort have pre-
viously demonstrated utility in exploring various biophysical cellular
properties such as the viscoelastic properties of cancer cells (23) and
neutrophils (24), examining nuclear deformability during migration
(25, 26) and for phenotypic discrimination (27). Although clusters
have been demonstrated to transit through 50- to 300-μm micro-
channels (28), capillary-sized microfluidic constrictions have yet
to be studied. Observations of CTC clusters in microchannel con-
strictions in conjunction and in vivo models organisms reveal how
CTC clusters dynamically reorganize to pass through narrow blood
vessels.
Results
Microfluidic devices designed to mimic the hydrodynamic properties
of capillary networks were developed consisting of 16 parallel micro-
channels that taper into 5-, 7-, or 10-μm “capillary constrictions” (Fig.
1B). Cancer cell clusters and CTC clusters traveling through these
capillary constrictions at 37 °C under physiological pressures of
7–33 cm H2O (29) were examined. Under these conditions, red blood
cells assumed morphologies similar to those reported in human capil-
laries (Supporting Information and Movies S1 and S2). Transit under
greater than physiological (83 cm H2O) pressures is presented in the
Supporting Information.
CTC Clusters Transit Through Narrow Constrictions in Single File.
Primary patient CTC clusters were isolated from blood specimens
of malignant melanoma patients undergoing treatment at Massachusetts
General Hospital Cancer Center (Fig. 1C). Blood samples from 10
different patients were processed using a recently developed label-
free microfluidic CTC cluster isolation technology (30). Patient CTC
clusters were successfully isolated from two samples, and one CTC
cluster isolated from patient MEL-142 was successfully released
from the cluster isolation chip and transferred to the microfluidic
capillary constriction device. Fig. 1D and Movie S3 depict the suc-
cessful transit of this CTC cluster through a capillary constriction.
This preliminary result prompted us to conduct further experiments
to determine how CTC clusters could be capable of this behavior.
Because of the difficulty in isolating, staining, and manipulating
extremely scarce primary patient clusters, we conducted experiments
using clusters from more readily available breast cancer patient
cultured CTCs (Fig. 1C) and cancer cell lines.
Over 90% of observed cancer cell line and cultured CTC clusters,
including those containing 20 or more cells (Movies S4–S6), trans-
ited through constrictions as small as 5 μm. Individual cells experi-
enced two distinct transit phases: an entry phase where cells
encountering capillary constrictions deformed and elongated (Fig.
1Eii) and a travel phase where cells no longer deformed but traveled
at constant velocity (Fig. 1Eiii). These phases are consistent with the
previously reported transit behaviors of individual cancer cells (23).
The transit of CTC clusters incorporated these behaviors at the level
of individual cells, but with added complexity due to multicellular
organization (Movie S4). When entering constrictions, clusters
“unfolded” so that cells could enter and pass sequentially (Fig. 1E ii
and iii). After exiting constrictions, cells retracted into rounded
morphologies and clusters reformed into “typical” organizations
(Fig. 1Eiv). To determine whether cells within CTC clusters transited
in single file, clusters containing mixed populations of breast cancer
cells engineered to express either GFP or mCherry (in approximately
equal numbers) were imaged while traversing capillary constrictions
(Fig. 2A). Both cell bodies and nuclei traversed in single file (Fig.
2A). Clusters also successfully transited in similar chain-like orga-
nizations through human endothelial cell-coated microchannels (Fig.
S1 and Movie S7). However, because of the variability in constriction
diameters across the lengths of cellularized microchannels (Fig. S1),
hydrodynamic analyses of CTC cluster transit, described below, were
conducted in non–cell-coated devices.
Single-File Transit Is Favored at Physiological Interaction Energies. It
was hypothesized that biophysical interactions between cells were
responsible for rearrangement into stable single-file chains. There-
fore, we developed a hybrid Brownian dynamics–Lattice Boltzmann
fluid–structure interaction computational model (31) to simulate
CTC cluster transit under the same conditions as the experiments
described above (Fig. 2B). The strengths of cell–cell interactions
were found to dramatically influence the transit behaviors of CTC
clusters. When interaction energies were set to (i) 1.5 × 10−3 J/m2
, to
approximate experimentally published values of cell–cell adhesions
in cancer cells (32, 33), simulated clusters elongated and transited in
single file similar to experimentally observed clusters (Fig. 2B,
middle row, and Movie S8); (ii) 6.0 × 10−4 J/m2, below physiologi-
cally relevant levels, clusters dissociated into individual cells during
transit (Fig. 2B, bottom row, and Movie S9); and (iii) 7.5 × 10−3 J/m2,
above physiological levels, clusters occluded constrictions (Fig. 2B,
top row, and Movie S10). These results suggest that the reorgani-
zation of clusters into single-file chains during transit is biophysically
favored at physiological cell interaction energies and that modifying
these interactions may dramatically alter the fate of CTC clusters at
capillary constrictions (explored below).
We next examined clusters as they transitioned from typical cluster
morphologies to single-file chains of cells by observing stained cell
membranes. Clusters underwent substantial reorientation as they en-
tered constrictions (Fig. 2 C–F and Movies S5 and S6). Cells near the
leading edges of clusters underwent less rotation than cells near the
trailing edges, which often rotated 180° or more (Fig. 2D). This be-
havior suggests that cells within clusters rotated to accommodate
stable intercellular junctions (Fig. 2C) and is consistent with compu-
tational simulations of cells demonstrating that physiological-level
interaction energies result in selective cleavage and retention of spe-
cific cell–cell adhesions. Another observation was that the order in
which cells transited could not be predicted by their relative distances
to the constrictions before entering (Fig. 2F). This led us to hypoth-
esize that the relative adhesive strengths among cells within a given
cluster dictate the order in which cells reorganize to pass through

 (Fig. 2E). If cells must break intercellular adhesions with all cells ex-
cept two adjacent neighbors, it is likely only the strongest cell–cell
adhesions are retained.
Cluster Reorganization Permits Transit by Reducing Resistance. In-
spection of CTC clusters revealed qualitative characteristics of
cell reorganization during transit (above). However, the key to
understanding the mechanisms that dominate cluster transit is to
evaluate transit hydrodynamics. We therefore compared the transit
behaviors of singlet CTCs and CTC clusters traversing 5-, 7-, and
10-μm capillary constrictions at 37 °C under 7- to 80-cm H2O applied
pressures. Cell diameter(s) and transit velocities of single cell and
cluster events were computed using custom Matlab scripts (Fig. 3A
and Movie S11).
First, the velocities of singlet MDA-MB-231-LM2 cells (solid
symbols) transiting under 33-cm H2O pressures through 5-μm (n =
18), 7-μm (n = 23), and 10-μm (n = 52) constrictions were plotted vs.
the ratio of cells to constriction sizes (Fig. 3 B and C). Cell velocities
ranged from 5 μm/s to unrestricted fluid velocities of ∼2,850 μm/s,
which encompassed the physiological capillary velocity of ∼200 μm/s.
Singlets exhibited three distinct transit regimes dictated by relative
size of the cell to the constriction (Fig. 3 B and C, solid symbols).
(i) Small cells (Dcell/Dcapillary < 1.5) transited at unrestricted fluid
velocities. (ii) Large cells (Dcell/Dcapillary > 3.6) occluded capillary
constrictions (the mean ratio for occluding cells was 3.8 ± 0.5 [95%
confidence interval (CI)]; occlusions occurred almost exclusively
in 5-μm constrictions) and were not included in this analysis.
(iii) Moderately sized cells (1.5 ≤ Dcell/Dcapillary ≤ 3.6) transited according
to a power law relation (23) with a power law exponent of −5.7 ± 0.6
(95% CI). This is consistent with theoretical scaling analyses (Sup-
porting Information) and previously reported values, which suggest a
power law exponent of approximately −5 (23). The strong power
relation between size and velocity means that small changes in in-
dividual cell sizes dramatically affect hydrodynamic resistance (Fig. 2A).
The transit behavior of clusters was then investigated by over-
laying cluster data points onto singlet data. The effective hydrody-
namic diameters of clusters were calculated in two manners for
comparison. When effective cluster diameters were set equal to
spheres of equivalent volumes as all constituent cells, cluster veloc-
ities deviated significantly from singlet velocities (Fig. 3C) (power
law exponents of −3.3 ± 0.9 vs. −5.7 ± 0.6, 95% CI), indicating that
clusters did not act as cohesive resistive units. However, when cluster
diameters were assumed to equal the diameters of their largest
constituent cells, the transit of CTC clusters was statistically in-
distinguishably from singlet counterparts (Fig. 3B) (power law ex-
ponents, −4.7 ± 1.2 vs. −5.7 ± 0.6, 95% CI). This agreement suggests
that the resistances of examined clusters were dominated by the
largest cell within each cluster; a result consistent with the singlet cell
findings that transit velocities depended strongly on size (above). It
should be noted that this approximation was accurate for clusters
containing relatively few cells (less than five in most cases). In the
general case, the behavior of clusters in constrictions was better
approximated as the sum of the resistances of each individual cell in
the cluster (Supporting Information and Fig. S2). Detailed hydrody-
namic analyses of CTC cluster transit using an expanded dataset with
transit scaling analyses are included in the Supporting Information
and Figs. S2–S4. Clusters that passed through constrictions were
observed to return to spherical morphologies and reassemble into
typical “cluster” morphologies within seconds (Supporting Informa-
tion, Fig. S5, and Movie S12). Transited clusters also remained viable
after exiting constrictions (Fig. S5) and proliferated at rates indis-
tinguishable from controls (Fig. S6). Theoretical cell and cluster
resistances derived from hydrodynamic analyses are presented for
comparison in Fig. S7.
Cell Nuclei Contribute Resistance in Very Narrow Vessels. To in-
vestigate the role of nuclei in cluster transit, the sizes and velocities
of nuclei within singlets and clusters were analyzed as described
above. Nuclei deformed from rounded to elongated ellipsoidal
morphologies upon entering constrictions (Fig. 3D and Movie S13).
The dependence of nuclear size on transit behavior is plotted in Fig.
3E. In 10-μm channels (n = 14), cell nuclei traversed capillaries at
unrestricted fluid velocities similar to whole-cell studies (Fig. 3 B and
C). In 7-μm channels (n = 29), nuclear diameters were not correlated
with cell velocities, suggesting that nuclei were not large enough to
offer significant resistance. However, in 5-μm channels, nuclei in
both singlets/clusters (n = 35/13, respectively) were inversely corre-
lated with cell velocities and were statistically indistinguishable from
one another (power law exponents, −4.3 ± 1.6 vs. −3.2 ± 2.2, re-
spectively, 95% CI).
Interestingly, the diameter-to-constriction ratios that dictated
transit regimes for whole cells (Fig. 3 B and C) (above) also
appeared to be valid for nuclei-to-constriction ratios. Nuclei tra-
versing 5-μm constrictions had diameter ratios within the power law
regime calculated for whole cells (1.7 ≤ Dnucleus/Dcapillary ≤ 2.5) but
below the whole-cell power law regime for most cells in 7-μm con-
strictions (1.2 ≤ Dnucleus/Dcapillary ≤ 1.8) and all nuclei in 10-μm
constrictions (0.9 ≤ Dnucleus/Dcapillary ≤ 1.3). These findings suggest
that nuclei may play a role in the transit of CTCs and CTC clusters in
narrow (∼5 μm) but not larger capillaries.

 Human CTC Clusters Transit in Whole Blood. Cultured CTC clusters
were derived from four breast cancer patients undergoing treatment
at Massachusetts General Hospital and cultured as previously de-
scribed (14). Cultured CTC clusters were spiked into whole blood
before introduction into capillary constriction devices to better
mimic the properties of the vascular fluid environment (Fig. 1C).
Cultured human CTC clusters traversed constrictions in the same
single-file manner as cancer cell and primary patient clusters (Fig.
4A and Movie S12). Importantly, cultured CTC clusters were grown
as 3D aggregates in suspension and were handled without chemical
or enzymatic agents that may have interfered with cell–cell adhe-
sions. The hydrodynamic behavior of cultured CTC clusters and
singlets from one patient (Brx-50) exhibited similar inverse rela-
tionships to cell size as cancer cells tested above (Fig. 4B) (power law
exponents, −3.89 ± 1.5 and −4.0 ± 1.8, s−1, 95% CI, respectively).
Using the largest cell in each cluster as the effective cluster size (as
described above), cluster velocities were slightly but significantly
lower than singlet velocities (P < 0.05). It is unclear why this is the
case, although interactions of CTCs and red blood cells within the
capillary constrictions may have been a contributing factor (Fig. 4Ai–iii).
Drugs Disrupt Clusters in Transit. Computational simulations sug-
gested that weakening cell–cell interaction energies could dissociate
clusters in transit (Fig. 2B). To test this hypothesis, Brx-50 patient
cultured CTC clusters were treated with 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 μM FAK
inhibitor 14 (FAK I-14), a selective small molecular inhibitor of focal
adhesion kinase (involved in cell–matrix adhesions) up-regulated in
many tumors (34) or paclitaxel (PTX), a commonly used chemo-
therapeutic agent that has been shown to weaken cell–cell adhesions
(35), for 24 h before transit through 7-μm capillary constrictions at
20 cm H2O. None of the drug-treated clusters were observed to
undergo significant dissociation or loss of viability vs. vehicle controls
before introduction into capillary constriction devices, suggesting that,
although these compounds are known to induce apoptosis, that pro-
grammed cell death was not primarily responsible for observed effects.
After entering capillary constrictions, drug-treated clusters were dis-
rupted into singlets and smaller aggregates (Fig. 4C and Movie S14) in a
similar manner predicted by computational simulations (Fig. 2B). Cul-
tured CTC clusters treated with 1.0 μM or greater FAK I-14 or PTX
showed statistically significantly greater probabilities of disruption vs.
control clusters (FAK I-14: 1.0 μM, 18.1 ± 4.9%, P < 0.05; 10.0 μM,

CTC Clusters Transit Through Capillary-Sized Vessels. To explore the
behavior of CTC clusters in capillary-sized vessels, cultured human
CTC clusters (Brx-50) tagged with GFP and nuclear stained with
Hoechst 33342 were transplanted into the circulation of Tg(kdrl:
mCherry) transgenic zebrafish embryos 3 days postfertilization. Over
120 CTC clusters transplanted into the circulation of 51 independent
animals were observed to transit through the comparatively wider
dorsal aortas and caudal veins (Fig. 4E and Movie S15) as well as
narrower vessels such as the aortic arches (Movie S16), branchial
arches (Movie S16), mandibular arches (Fig. 4F), and intersegmental
vessels (Fig. 4G and Movie S17). Because individual zebrafish ves-
sels, unlike engineered microfluidic constrictions, vary greatly in
diameter (36) and cannot be practically set to desired intravascular
pressures, cluster velocities in zebrafish could not be directly com-
pared with those within capillary constrictions. However, CTC
clusters remained viable (as determined by membrane impermeable
fluorescent molecule localization) and exhibited similar single-file
reorganization behavior as in vitro counterparts (Fig. 4 F and G).
An interesting observation was that many CTC clusters that en-
tered the dorsal aorta were observed to deposit in the caudal vein
plexus (Fig. S8), directly upstream of a sharp 180° turn in the cir-
culation where the dorsal aorta feeds into the caudal vein, a geom-
etry not present in human capillaries. In addition, CTC clusters that
appeared to have stopped within the vasculature were observed to
have transited from apparent occlusion sites over minutes to hours
(Fig. S9), suggesting the potential for reinitiation of cluster transit after
occlusion and/or a slow “creeping” transit behavior. This observation
may explain the reportedly short circulating half-lives of CTCs (37)
and CTC clusters (9) because increased residence times within capil-
laries may inhibit/delay their detection or sampling from larger vessels.
Further studies are needed to explore these phenomena.
Discussion
In contradiction to the decades-held assumption that CTC clusters
are incapable of transiting through narrow vessels (16), this work is
to our knowledge the first direct evidence that CTC clusters can
traverse capillary-sized constrictions and blood vessels under phys-
iological conditions. Even in whole blood, cultured CTC clusters
successfully transited through capillary constrictions with over
90% efficiency. Clusters of both mesenchymal (cultured breast
cancer and MDA-MB-231) and epithelial (primary melanoma
patient and LNCaP) cell phenotypes exhibited similar transit be-
haviors. These results are supported by both computational
simulations, which verified that this behavior was favored at
physiological cell–cell interaction energies, and by in vivo xeno-
transplantation studies. Zebrafish embryos were chosen as model
organisms for transplantation because they have ∼5- to 10-μm-
diameter one-cell-thick blood vessels that are close analogs of
human capillaries (36), have conservative pressure drops across
their circulation [∼10–100 times lower than that across human
capillaries (29, 38)], and, unlike mouse or rat models, are optically
transparent allowing for whole-organism imaging of transgenically
labeled vasculature. The remarkable ability of CTC clusters to transit

CELL BIOLOGY
 through capillary-sized vessels suggests that the term circulating tu-
mor “microemboli” may be a misnomer and that the dissemination
of CTC clusters to distant organs may contribute to their greater
metastatic potential.
The key to CTC cluster transit through narrow blood vessels ap-
pears to be their ability to rapidly and reversibly unfold into single-
file chains through selective cleavage of intercellular adhesions.
This unfolding behavior is critically important for successful transit
because, instead of acting as cohesive resistive units, CTC clusters
act as individual cells in series, which significantly reduce their
overall resistances to flow. Because of the timescales at which clus-
ters unfold to enter constrictions and reorganize after exiting (ap-
proximately milliseconds to seconds), the responses of CTC clusters
are likely dominated by the state of existing intercellular adhesions
and cytoskeletal elements. An interesting area of investigation is
whether the physical forces exerted on clusters during transit may
contribute to the greater metastatic ability of CTC clusters vs. sin-
glets (6–9). For example, mechanotransduction pathways involved in
the metastatic progression of cancer cells (39, 40) may provide CTC
clusters with biophysical cues that promote the extravasation, mi-
gration, and eventual colonization of new tumors.
Finally, strategies that interfere with cell–cell or cell–matrix ad-
hesions may lead to the disruption of clusters in constrictions where
high intravascular shear forces are present. Because of the greater
metastatic potential of clustered circulating tumor cells than singlets
(9) and of larger clusters vs. smaller clusters (7), this strategy may be
an effective method of reducing the probability of metastasis, the
leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide.
Materials and Methods
Single CTCs and CTC clusters containing ∼2–20 cells of patient (obtained with
informed consent according to Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional
Review Board Protocol 05-300) and cancer cell line origins were introduced into
5- to 10-μm microfluidic constrictions under pressure drops of 7–83 cm H2O at
37 °C and analyzed using custom Matlab scripts to calculate cell/nuclear sizes
(Fig. S10) and velocities. Human cultured CTC clusters were introduced into the
bloodstream of 3 d postfertilization Tg(kdrl:mCherry) transgenic zebrafish
(Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care Pro-
tocol 2011N000127) for observation. Complete materials and methods are
available in Supporting Information.
