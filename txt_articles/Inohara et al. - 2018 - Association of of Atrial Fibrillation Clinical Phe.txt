IMPORTANCE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is usually classified on the basis of the disease subtype.
However, this characterization does not capture the full heterogeneity of AF, and a
data-driven cluster analysis reveals different possible classifications of patients.
OBJECTIVE To characterize patients with AF based on a cluster analysis and to evaluate the
association between these phenotypes, treatment, and clinical outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cluster analysis used data from an observational
cohort that included 9749 patients with AF who had been admitted to 174 US sites
participating in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation
(ORBIT-AF) registry. Data analysis was completed from January 2017 to October 2017.
EXPOSURE Patients with diagnosed AF who were included in the registry.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Composite of major adverse cardiovascular or neurological
events and major bleeding, as defined by the International Society of Thrombosis and
Hemostasis criteria.
RESULTS Of 9749 total patients, 4150 (42.6%) were female; 8719 (89.4%) were white and
477 (4.9%) were African American. A cluster analysis was performed using 60 baseline
clinical characteristics, and it classified patients with AF into 4 statistically driven clusters:
(1) those with considerably lower rates of risk factors and comorbidities than all other clusters
(n = 4673); (2) those with AF at younger ages and/or with comorbid behavioral disorders
(n = 963); (3) those with AF who had similarities to patients with tachycardia-brachycardia
and had device implantation owing to sinus node dysfunction (n = 1651); and (4) those with
AF and prior coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and/or atherosclerotic
comorbidities (n = 2462). Conventional classifications, such as AF subtype and left atrial size,
did not drive cluster formation. Compared with the low comorbidity AF cluster, adjusted risks
of major adverse cardiovascular or neurological events were significantly higher in the other
3 clusters (behavioral comorbidity cluster: hazard ratio [HR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.10-2.00; device
implantation cluster: HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.15-1.68; and atherosclerotic comorbidity cluster: HR,
1.59; 95% CI, 1.31-1.92). For major bleeding, adjusted risks were higher in the behavioral
disorder comorbidity cluster (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05-1.73), those with device implantation
(HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.47), and those with atherosclerotic comorbidities (HR, 1.13; 95% CI,
0.96-1.33) compared with the low comorbidity cluster. The same clusters were identified in
an external validation in the ORBIT AF II registry.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cluster analysis identified 4 clinically relevant phenotypes of
AF that each have distinct associations with clinical outcomes, underscoring the
heterogeneity of AF and importance of comorbidities and substrates.

 A
trial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased risks
of heart failure, cognitive impairment, thromboembo-
lism, and death. Classification of AF is often based on
disease subtype (paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing per-
sistent/permanent), left atrial size, or thromboembolism risk
(eg,thescorethatapatientreceivesontheCHA2DS2-VAScscale,
an instrument designed to predict the risk of stroke in pa-
tients with AF).1 These categories are often used to guide
patient management and treatment decisions. However, AF is
a very heterogeneous condition caused by a variety of under-
lying processes and disorders, and it might not be optimally
characterized with simplified risk scores.2
Cluster analysis is a data-driven approach commonly used
in other fields of research. It measures differences between in-
dividual cases on the basis of their characteristics and finds
clusters of patients who are more similar to each other than
thepatientsinotherclusters.Thisstatisticalapproachhasbeen
applied in a variety of places in medicine, and has been dem-
onstratedtoimprovecharacterizationofdiseasephenotypes.3-7
In a large cohort of patients with AF, we sought to use clus-
ter analysis to identify novel groups of patients with AF who
share similar phenotypes and to evaluate whether these clus-
ter phenotypes are associated with different treatment pat-
terns and outcomes.
Methods
Data Source
TheOutcomesRegistryforBetterInformedTreatmentofAtrial
Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF) is a prospective, nationwide multi-
center registry of patients with new-onset and ongoing cases
of AF. Patients were enrolled by a diverse group of health care
professionals, including internists, cardiologists, and
electrophysiologists.8 Eligible patients were those 18 years and
older who had electrographically documented AF, who were
able to provide informed consent, and who adhered to local
follow-up. Patients with AF due to a reversible cause (eg, pul-
monary embolism, acute thyrotoxicosis, or postoperative sta-
tus), solitary atrial flutter without AF, or a life expectancy of
less than 6 months were excluded.
Health care centers participating in the ORBIT-AF regis-
try used a web-based case report form to record patient de-
mographics, medical history, medications, vital signs, labo-
ratory data, imaging parameters, and electrocardiographic
parameters. The data collection process also included the
CHA2DS2-VASc scale; the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in
Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scale; the ORBIT scale, a 5-item scale
that predicts bleeding in patients with AF; and the European
Heart Rhythm Association Scale, which quantifies AF symp-
toms.Follow-updatawerecollectedatapproximately6-month
intervals for up to 24 months. Major clinical outcomes as-
sessed at follow-up included all-cause mortality, cardiovas-
cular death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization, stroke or
non–central nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism, new-
onset heart failure, and bleeding.
This study was approved by the institutional review board
at Duke University, which also served as the coordinating cen-
ter for the study, and each participating center obtained local
institutional review board approval. Informed written con-
sent was obtained from each participant.
Outcomes
For the purpose of this analysis, the primary outcome mea-
sure was major adverse cardiovascular or neurological events
(MACNE), which was defined as a composite of cardiovascu-
lar death, myocardial infarction, stroke/non-CNS systemic em-
bolism, or transient ischemic attack. In addition, individual
components of MACNE, all-cause death, new-onset heart fail-
ure, all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular hospitaliza-
tion, bleeding hospitalization, and major bleeding were also
assessed. Major bleeding was defined by the International
Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis criteria as follows9:
fatal bleeding and/or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area
or organ and/or bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of
2 g/dL or more or leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of
whole blood or red blood cells.
Clustering
The ORBIT-AF registry enrolled 10 137 patients with AF be-
tween June 2010 and August 2011 at 176 sites within the United
States. After excluding patients with missing follow-up
information (n = 388), the final cohort included 9749
patients from 174 sites.
The statistical methodology of cluster analysis has been
described previously.3 The process of identifying patient clus-
ters included multiple steps. First, we selected 60 candidate
baseline variables that represented key characteristics of pa-
tients with AF (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). Variable re-
duction was then performed to group the list of candidate vari-
ablesintodisjointvariableclusters(eAppendix2andeMethods
in the Supplement). This process was performed separately on
continuous and binary variables, resulting in 3 clusters of con-
tinuousvariablesand11clustersofcategoricalvariables(eTable
1 in the Supplement).
A summary score for each individual patient was derived
based on each of the 14 identified variable clusters. We stan-
Key Points
Question How different are groupings derived from cluster
analysis from traditional classifications of patients with atrial
fibrillation?
Findings This cluster analysis identified 4 statistically driven
clusters: (1) a cluster with low comorbid burden;
(2) a younger/behavioral disorder cluster; (3) a cluster who
resembled patients with tachycardia-bradycardia and had
implanted devices; and (4) a cluster defined by atherosclerotic
comorbidities. These groupings are not driven by conventional
classifications and have different risks for adverse clinical
outcomes.
Meaning Cluster analysis highlighted the considerable
heterogeneity among patients with atrial fibrillation; cluster
classification may identify differences in phenotypes, variations
of clinical practice, and potential targets for improving the quality
of care.

 dardized the 14 scores to have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1.10
The standardized value measures how many SDs a given data
point was above (positive value) or below (negative value) the
mean. From this, the Ward minimum variance method of clus-
tering was used to identify patient clusters. A tree diagram is
provided to display the semipartial R2 obtained at each inter-
action of the clustering process (Figure 1). Small values of the
semipartial R2 indicate that the merged clusters were similar,
and large values indicate the combination of 2 dissimilar
(heterogeneous) clusters. Because this is the first experience
to our knowledge with cluster analysis in the population of pa-
tients with AF, the determination of the numbers of clusters
was not prespecified. The goal was to determine clusters that
were homogeneous, based on the semipartial R2, and illustra-
tive of particular types of patients, all blinded to outcomes and
treatment patterns. Examination of the tree diagram indi-
cated that the groupings became more heterogeneous after
beingexpandedto6clusters.Both6-clusterand4-clustermod-
els were examined. The 4-cluster model retained a semipar-
tial R2 of 0.04 and formed much clearer patterns of patient
groups than 6-cluster model. Therefore the 4-cluster model
were used in this study.
External Validation
To evaluate the robustness of the analysis, external valida-
tion was performed using the ORBIT-AF II Registry. The
ORBIT-AF II Registry has a similar structure to the ORBIT-AF
Registry,butenrolledamutuallyexclusivepopulation.Theen-
rollment period of the ORBIT-AF II Registry was from Febru-
ary 2013 to April 2016, a more recent period than that of the
ORBIT-AF Registry (which enrolled patients from June 2010
throughAugust2011).IncontrasttoORBIT-AF,ORBIT-AFIIalso
included only patients who had either a new diagnosis of AF
within the previous 6 months or who had initiated an oral an-
ticoagulant treatment regimen (excluding vitamin K) for AF.
Weappliedthesameclusteringtechniquetothepatientsen-
rolledintheORBIT-AFIIRegistry(n = 12679).Similartothemain
analysis, we obtained 3 clusters of continuous variables and 11
clusters of categorical variables through the variable reduction
process.AsemipartialR2 of0.04,whichwasthesamevaluewe
used in the main analysis, was used to determine the final
number of clusters, resulting in identification of 4 clusters.
Characteristics and Outcome Comparisons
Baseline characteristics were compared among 4 identified
clusters. The key characteristics that differentiated the clus-
ters were determined on the basis of the variables that were
markedly different among clusters. Conventional AF classifi-
cations, including degree of left atrial enlargement, AF
diagnostic subtype, and CHA2DS2-VASc risk score, were
also compared for the 4 clusters. Continuous variables are
presented as medians with interquartile ranges or means
with SDs, and the differences across clusters were assessed
using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical variables are
reported as counts and percentages, and differences were
assessed using the χ2 test.
The association between clusters and clinical outcomes
was assessed using the unadjusted and adjusted Cox propor-
tionalhazardsmodels.ModelswereadjustedbyCHA2DS2-VASc
score for MACNE, cardiovascular death, and thromboem-
bolic event outcomes or by ORBIT bleeding score for major
bleeding and bleeding hospitalization outcomes. Models were
also adjusted for medications (anticoagulant agent, antiplate-
let agent, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angioten-
sin 2 receptor blocker, and β-blocker, statin, and antiarrhyth-
mic agent) and the specialty of the physician treating the
patient (internal medicine/primary care, cardiology, electro-
physiology,andneurology).Thehazardratio(HR)foreachclus-
ter is presented along with 95% confidence intervals and cor-
responding P values. For MACNE, a Kaplan-Meier plot with the
log-rank test was also derived and assessed.
All variables had less than 5% missing data, except for esti-
matedglomerularfiltrationrate(7.3%),hematocrit(10.2%),left
ventricularejectionfraction(LVEF)(10.0%),andleftatrialdiam-
eter (13.9%). To account for missing data, multiple imputation
was used. Imputed values were obtained by the Markov chain
Monte Carlo method or regression methods. The deidentified
aggregate data were analyzed by the Duke Clinical Research
Institute using SAS software (version 9.3; SAS Institute). Data
analysis was completed from January 2017 to October 2017.

 Results
Baseline Characteristics
Clinical variables according to the 4 identified clusters are de-
tailed in Table 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement. Key charac-
teristics of each patient cluster were as follows.
Low Comorbidity Cluster
The low comorbidity cluster (n = 4673) was the largest clus-
ter, with approximately twice as many patients as any other
cluster. Patients in the low comorbidity cluster were the sec-
ond youngest cluster, with a median age of 73 years (inter-
quartile range [IQR], 65-81 years), and had considerably lower
rates of risk factors and comorbidities than all other clusters,
including the lowest rates of diabetes (1129/4673; 24.2%),
sleep apnea (798/4673; 17.1%), prior myocardial infarction
(108/4673; 2.3%), heart failure (921/4673; 19.7%), chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease (518/4673; 11.1%), and prior stroke
or transient ischemic attack (564/4673; 12.1%). Reflecting the
relatively good health status of the people in this cluster, their
median LVEF (60%; interquartile range [IQR], 55%-65%) was
higherthanthoseinanyotherclusters(younger/behavioraldis-
order cluster: 55%; IQR, 50-60; device implantation cluster:
55%; IQR, 50-60; atherosclerotic-comorbid cluster: 55%; IQR,
40-60) (P < .001). They also had the lowest mean (SD)
CHA2DS2-VASc and ORBIT bleeding scores, which were 3.39
(1.69) and 1.95 (1.51), respectively, and the second-lowest mean
(SD) ATRIA bleeding score, which was 2.61 (1.96).
Younger/Behavioral Disorder Cluster
These patients (n = 963) were, on average, the youngest (me-
dian age, 69 years; IQR, 61-77) and the most likely to be male
(700/963; 72.7%). The key and distinguishing characteristics
of this cluster were the highest rates of liver disease (169/963;
17.6%), alcohol abuse (356/963; 37.0%), drug abuse (118/963;
12.3%), and current smoking (485/963; 50.4%). Patients with
any 1 of these medical conditions were categorized exclu-
sivelyintheyounger/behavioraldisordercluster.Theyalsohad
the highest body mass index (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared) among the 4 clus-
ters (median, 30; IQR, 26-35). While patients in the younger/
behavioraldisorderclusteralsohadthehighestratesofchronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (275/963; 28.6%) and obstruc-
tive sleep apnea (220/963; 22.9%), the prevalence rates of non-
pulmonary comorbidities were relatively low. Notably, their
renal function was the most normal of the 4 clusters, as
measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (median,
73.3 mL/min/1.73 m2; IQR, 57.7-88.2 mL/min/1.73 m2). Reflect-
ing the younger age of patients in this cluster, the risk scores
wererelativelylower,andtheyhadthelowestmean(SD)ATRIA
bleeding score (2.44 [1.96]), and the second-lowest mean (SD)
CHA2DS2-VASc and ORBIT scores, which were 3.42 (1.75) and
1.98 (1.59), respectively.
Device Implantation Cluster
The 1651 patients in this cluster were characterized by their re-
semblance to patients with tachycardia-bradycardia. The
uniquecharacteristicofthesepatientsappearedtobetheirhigh
prevalenceofdeviceimplantationowingtothesinusnodedys-
function or atrioventricular node ablation, which was present
in 1504 of the 1650 participants for whom data was available
(91.2%). The majority of implanted cardiac electronic devices
in this cluster were pacemakers. Patients in this cluster also
exhibited the highest European Heart Rhythm Association
symptom scores (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement) and 313 of
1644 patients for whom these data were available (18.9%) re-
ported either severe AF symptoms (276/1644; 16.8%) or dis-
abling AF symptoms (37/1644; 2.3%) that affected or discon-
tinued their normal daily activities.11 They had the highest
mean (SD) ATRIA bleeding scores (3.75 [2.11]), and the second-
highest mean (SD) CHA2DS2-VASc and ORBIT bleeding scores
(4.57 [1.61] and 2.83 [1.66], respectively).
Atherosclerotic-Comorbid Cluster
This cluster (n = 2462) included a higher percentage of male
(1694/2462;68.8%)patientsandahighermedianage(77years;
IQR, 69-82 years). A major feature of patients in the athero-
sclerotic-comorbid AF cluster is that 1973 of these 2462 pa-
tients (80.1%) had history of coronary artery disease, and they
also had the highest prevalence of prior myocardial infarc-
tion (982/2462; 39.9%) and coronary revascularization,
whether surgical (884/2462; 35.9%) or percutaneous (1042/
2462; 42.3%). They also had the lowest LVEF (median, 55%;
IQR, 40-60) among the 4 clusters and highest rates of heart
failure (1273/2462; 51.7%). They also had the highest preva-
lence of most other risk factors and comorbidities, including
hypertension (2137/2462; 86.8%), hyperlipidemia (2092/
2462; 85.0%), diabetes (930/2462; 37.8%), chronic kidney dis-
ease (1088/2333; 46.6%), anemia (660/2462; 26.8%), prior gas-
trointestinal bleeding (360/2462; 14.6%), and peripheral
vascular disease (516/2462; 21.0%). Reflecting the presence
of many comorbidities, they had the highest mean (SD)
CHA2DS2-VASc and ORBIT scores (4.75 [1.55] and 2.99 [1.73],
respectively) and had the second highest mean (SD) ATRIA
bleeding score (3.65 [2.26]).
Association With Conventional Classifications
We examined the relationship between the 4 identified clus-
ters and conventional AF classifications including degree of
left atrial enlargement, AF subtype, and CHA2DS2-VASc score.
The differences in the distribution of left atrial size and AF
subtype were not clinically meaningful, whereas the
CHA2DS2-VASc scores did vary significantly across the clus-
ters (P < .001; details appear in eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
In the device implantation cluster and atherosclerotic-
comorbid cluster, the proportions of patients with a risk score
of 4 or higher were each approximately 75% (per eTable 2 in
the Supplement); however, those in the low-comorbidity clus-
terandyounger/behavioraldisorderclusterwerelessthan50%.
Treatment Patterns by Clusters
Table 2 lists the differences in treatment patterns by clusters.
With respect to management strategy, patients in the device
implantation cluster were more likely to be managed with a
rate control strategy than those in the other 3 clusters

low comorbidity cluster, 67.9% [95% CI, 65.0%-70.9%] in the
younger/behavioral disorder cluster, and 69.9% [95% CI,
68.0%-71.7%] in the atherosclerotic-comorbid cluster;
P= .003). Class 1c antiarrhythmic medications were more fre-
quently prescribed to those patients in the low comorbidity
cluster, whereas sotalol was most commonly prescribed to the
patients in the device implantation cluster (to 121/1651 pa-
tients, or 7.6% [95% CI, 6.4%-8.9%], compared with 6.3% [95%
CI, 5.6%-7.0%] in the low comorbidity cluster, 5.5% [95% CI,
4.1%-6.9%] in the younger/behavioral disorder cluster, and
4.9%[95%CI,4.1%-5.8%]intheatherosclerotic-comorbidclus-
ter; P= .003). Reflecting the highest prevalence of coronary ar-
tery disease and heart failure, patients in the atherosclerotic-
comorbid cluster were more likely to be receiving β-blockers,
statins, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
and antiplatelet agents (aspirin and/or clopidgrel) than those
in the 3 other clusters. In contrast, among patients who have
a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or higher and therefore should be
undergoing anticoagulation therapy, patients in the younger/
behavioral disorder cluster and those in the atherosclerotic-
comorbid cluster were less likely to be treated with an oral
anticoagulant (74.5%; 95% CI, 71.5%-77.4% and 76.5%; 95% CI,
74.8%-78.2%, respectively) than those in the low comorbid-
ity cluster and those in the device implantation cluster (79.3%;
95% CI, 78.1%-80.6% and 79.9%; 95% CI, 77.9%-81.8%)
(P < .001).
Association With Clinical Outcomes
The occurrence of MACNE across the different clusters is il-
lustrated in Kaplan-Meier curves in Figure 2. The occurrence
of MACNE was different across the 4 clusters. Patients in the
low comorbidity cluster had the lowest risk of MACNE (2.58
events per 100 patient-years), followed in ascending order by
those in the younger/behavioral disorder cluster (3.97 events
per 100 patient-years), those in the device implantation clus-
ter (5.10 events per 100 patient-years), and those with athero-
sclerotic-comorbid AF, who were at highest risk (6.12 events
per 100 patient-years; P < .001). A similar trend was ob-
served in each individual component of the MACNE compos-
ite (Table 3). In addition, the differences in outcomes across
clusterswerestillapparentafteradjustmentforCHA2DS2-VASc
scores, medications, and provider subspecialty (P < .001; eFig-
ure 2 in the Supplement). Compared with the low comorbid-
ity cluster, the adjusted risks of MACNE were significantly
higherinthe3otherclusters(younger/behavioraldisorderclus-
ter: HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.10-2.00; device implantation cluster:
HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.15-1.68; and the atherosclerotic comorbid
cluster: HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.31-1.92).
Formajorbleedingandbleedinghospitalizationevents,pa-
tients in the device implantation cluster exhibited the high-
est risk (Table 3). Patients in the low comorbidity cluster con-
sistently demonstrated the lowest risk for all outcomes. After
adjusting for the ORBIT bleeding score, medications, and phy-
sician subspecialty, compared with the low comorbidity clus-
ter, the adjusted risks were generally higher in the 3 other
clusters, and patients in the device implantation cluster had
the highest risk profile (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.47 for major
bleeding; HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.14-1.64 for bleeding hospitaliza-
tion) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
External Validation
Clinical variables according to the 4 identified clusters from
the external validation using the ORBIT-AF II Registry are de-
tailed in eTable 1 and eTable 3 in the Supplement. The identi-
fied clusters from the validation cohort were almost identical
to clusters we identified in the main analysis.
Discussion
We applied cluster analysis in a large cohort of patients with
AF to identify alternative and informative clinical phenotyp-
ing, and there are 4 major findings. First, this cluster analysis
led to the identification of 4 clinically relevant and recogniz-
able phenotypes. Second, conventional measures of AF dura-
tion, including AF disease subtype (paroxysmal, persistent, or
long-standing persistent/permanent) and left atrial size, did

the clusters. Finally, these distinct clusters were associated
with different risk for major cardiovascular and neurologic
adverse events.
Using a phenotype-mapping algorithm, we were able to
take advantage of the detailed patient-level variables in our AF
cohort and find patterns of association, which allowed a novel
grouping of patients with AF. Surprisingly, conventional mea-

 of clusters. The identified clusters often emphasized over-
looked variables in conventional classifications, such the pres-
ence of cardiac-implanted electronic devices, or the combi-
nation of liver disease, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and current
smoking. While persistent forms of AF are associated with
worseoutcomes,12classificationofAFdiseasesubtypehassev-
eral limitations, including its dynamic nature1 and difficul-
ties with quantification of each type.13 These newly de-
scribed cluster phenotypes confirm that AF is a very
heterogeneousconditioncausedbyavarietyofunderlyingcon-
ditions,anditsdiversityisnotalwayswelldescribedusingcon-
ventional classifications.
The clusters did resemble several recognizable groups of
patients with AF. For example, patients in the cluster domi-
nated by the presence of cardiac-implanted electronic de-
vices resembled patients with tachycardia-bradycardia syn-
drome and more frequently had AF with accompanying sinus
node dysfunction requiring pacemaker implantation. Pa-
tients in the atherosclerotic-comorbid cluster were much more
likely to have AF complicated by ischemic heart disease. They
exhibited the highest rates of comorbidities, including coro-
nary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction or revascular-
ization, and heart failure due to reduced left ventricular sys-
tolic function. Ischemic heart disease is a known risk factor for
AF. Left atrial ischemia increases focal drivers and perpetu-
ates AF.14 Unsurprisingly, patients in the atherosclerotic-
comorbid cluster also had high rates of cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and
chronic kidney disease. Since cardiovascular risks factors are
often modifiable and coronary artery disease can be pre-
vented, the identification of poor outcomes in the atheroscle-
rotic-comorbid cluster highlights the importance of mea-
sures to prevent AF and its contributory states. In addition, the
key characteristics of patients in the younger/behavioral dis-
orderclusterwereliverdisease,alcoholabuse,drugabuse,cur-
rent smoking, and obesity, which is a reasonable combina-
tion of patient characteristics that was not anticipated before
clustering. Liver disease, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse are
variables included in the HAS-BLED bleeding score,15 as are
validated risk factors for bleeding events. Also, Angoulvant
et al16 demonstrated that active smoking was independently
associated with a higher risk of major bleeding. The results
of this cluster analysis also suggest that smokers are at an
increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events.

 bid AF cluster had the highest ischemic event rates despite a
reasonably high anticoagulation use, risk factor modification
and/or treatment of residual risk would be an optimal clinical
approach.Forpatientsintheyounger/behavioraldisorderclus-
ter, lifestyle modification might be the most effective means
to improve outcomes. Moreover, the data suggest that appro-
priate blood pressure management should be universally em-
phasized, given the large proportion of hypertension even in
patients classified as having low-comorbidity AF.
In future work, the efficacy of these hypotheses, inter-
ventions, and potential treatment heterogeneity should be
evaluated and tested. Furthermore, clarifying the interaction
between clusters and treatment, such as anticoagulation
therapy and ablation or lifestyle modification of stroke risk,
could substantially enhance the clinical implications of phe-
notype cluster analysis.
Limitations
Our findings should be interpreted in the context of several
potential limitations. First, we consider this analysis to be
hypothesis generating. We are not proposing a formal classi-
fication system for AF. Our objective was to demonstrate
that application of a relatively novel statistical approach to a
large population of patients with AF can yield clinically rel-
evant patient groupings that highlight factors that may be
overlooked and absent from conventional classifications.
Such findings may lead to improvements in AF classifica-
tion. Second, clustering algorithm results are dependent on
the underlying population, available clinical variables, and
associated patterns of care in the community. Thus, find-
ings might differ if additional variables are available or
included. Although ORBIT-AF is a nationwide registry of
patients with AF cared for by a diverse group of health care
professionals, our registry was not a population sample, but
rather relied on voluntary participation from sites and
patients. Thus, the patients enrolled might not be entirely
representative of the broader populations. Therefore, a clus-
tering algorithm might not be able to identify the similar
clusters and may instead clarify different type of clusters
(eg, a valvular-related cluster) in other, more diverse
groups. Generalizability of our findings should be explored
in additional cohorts.
Finally, the ultimate selection of 4 clusters was based in
partoninvestigatordiscretion.Theincorporationofmoreclus-
ters might yield differing groupings and clinical outcomes.
Conclusions
This analysis demonstrates that unsupervised cluster analy-
sis can identify meaningful, clinically relevant categories and
phenotypes of patients with AF. These clusters exhibit signifi-
cant differences in underlying comorbidities and differential
risk of adverse outcomes. Cluster phenotypes also demon-
strated independent prognostic value, especially for cardio-
vascular outcomes, even after accounting for CHA2DS2-VASc
risk scores. Our results highlight the high degree of heteroge-
neity within the population of patients with AF, and the pos-
sibility that cluster classification can help identify important
differences in AF subgroups and subsequent health out-
comes. Such insight may inform treatment decisions and/or
inform future studies of this disease.
