mercury concentrations and fish
consumption in women of child bearing
Age in the united states using NHANES
data from 1999–2010

Background: The primary route of exposure to methylmercury (MeHg), a known developmental neurotoxicant, is
from ingestion of seafood. Since 2004, women of reproductive age in the U.S. have been urged to eat fish and
shellfish as part of a healthy diet while selecting species that contain lower levels MeHg. Yet few studies have
examined trends in MeHg exposure and fish consumption over time in this group of women with respect to their
geographical location in the U.S.
Methods: Data from six consecutive cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),
1999–2010 (n = 9597) were used to determine trends in blood mercury for women aged 16–49 residing in different
regions in the US, and according to age, race/ethnicity, income level, and fish consumption using geographic variables.
Results: Overall, mean blood mercury concentrations differed across survey cycles and mercury concentrations were
lower in 2009–2010 compared to 1999–2000. There were regional patterns in fish consumption and blood Hg
concentrations with women living in coastal regions having the highest fish consumption in the past 30 days and the
highest blood Hg levels compared to women residing inland.
Conclusions: On average, U.S. women of reproductive age were consuming more fish and blood mercury levels were
lower in 2009–2010 compared to 1999–2000. However, efforts to encourage healthy fish consumption may need to be
tailored to different regions in the U.S. given the observed spatial variability in blood mercury levels.

Background
The general population is exposed to methylmercury, a
known neurotoxicant, primarily from fish consumption
[1–6]. Methylmercury concentrations vary within and
between fish species by more than 100-fold [7, 8]. For
instance, the concentrations of mercury ranges from
<0.003 ppm (ppm) for shellfish such as scallops and
shrimp, to many ppm for high end predatory fish such
as tuna, swordfish, and shark [9, 10]. Freshwater fish
such as walleye and northern pike can also have high
methylmercury [11, 12]. Consequently, an individual’s
methylmercury exposure largely depends on the type
and frequency of fish species consumed.
Fish advisories target women of childbearing age due to
the greater sensitivity of the developing fetus to methyl
mercury’s toxicity. Yet, communicating the risks and
benefits of seafood consumption is challenging due to the
need to
reduce
MeHg
exposure while
encouraging
consumption of fish which are the primary source of
omega 3-fatty acids in the diet [10]. In the U.S., the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) have issued a joint advisory
for pregnant women, women who may become pregnant,
nursing mothers and young children. The advisory recom-
mends avoiding specific types of fish that contain high

 levels of mercury, including Gulf tilefish, shark, swordfish,
and king mackerel, as well as limiting the intake of alba-
core tuna to 6 oz per week [9]. At the same time, the
advisory also states that fish is a healthy food due to its
unique nutrient profile and that women of child bearing
age should consume fish low in mercury up to twice a
week. The most recent recommendations released by the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2015 (DGA, 2015) put
more emphasis on the benefits rather than simply stating
that women should consume up to two meals per week of
seafood that is low in methylmercury. However, research
has demonstrated that while consumers are aware of the
methylmercury found in fish and the risks associated with
this, they are unaware of any specific advice regarding fish
consumption [13, 14]. While more research is needed to
determine how to promote healthy seafood consumption,
it is reasonable to be concerned that mercury advice might
lead to reduced fish intake or inhibit needed increased
consumption, but the evidence that this actually has
happened is weak [15].
To determine if U.S. women of childbearing age are
adopting the intended practices embodied in fish advi-
sories and opting to consume fish species with lower
mercury levels, it is necessary to evaluate databases that
contain geographic-specific data, in combination with
blood mercury data and fish consumption data. The
current reference level of methylmercury in blood, set by
the U.S. EPA, is 5.8 μg/L. The reference level is the equi-
librium blood mercury level that is associated with a
dietary intake of methylmercury at the current reference
dose of 0.1 μg/kg-bw/day. This reference level defines
the long-term average level of mercury in blood that was
judged to be without appreciable risk when the reference
dose was promulgated. However, recent research and a
re-analysis of the data used to determine the reference
dose has challenged the appropriateness of this reference
level [7, 16]. Differences have also been found in
maternal and cord blood mercury levels due to bio-
concentration of methylmercury across the placenta [8,
10, 17–20]. Since more recent research strongly suggests
that the current reference level may be the level of ex-
posure at which adverse effects begin to be observed,
the level of 3.5 μg/L suggested by previous researchers
may be a more relevant benchmark for comparison until
an updated reference dose is determined [8, 21].
This study examines the regional variation and tem-
poral trends of fish consumption patterns with regards
to blood mercury levels in women of childbearing age in
the U.S. from 1999 to 2010. We hypothesized that type
of fish being consumed and quantity of fish consump-
tion and therefore total whole blood mercury levels
would vary by region. Specifically, that those living in
coastal areas would have higher fish consumption and
higher blood mercury levels than non-coastal residents
and that this would also vary by geographic location in
the U.S.
Methods
Study population
NHANES is a continuous national survey that evalu-
ates the health and nutritional status of the non-
institutionalized
US
population
conducted
by
the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This
study was limited to data from women of childbearing
age (16–49 years of age) in six consecutive cycles of
NHANES spanning from 1999 to 2010 (N = 9,597). In
addition to the publically available data, this analysis
used the respondent’s county as a geographic unit.
This is a restricted variable and special permission to
access this data was granted from the NCHS. Proce-
dures for accessing restricted variables can be found
online.
Fish consumption data
Participants completed an interview that asked them to
recall the number of times they ate 31 types of fish or
shellfish in the previous 30 days. No data were collected
on the amount of each species consumed. Frequency of
fish and shellfish consumption across the 30-day recall
period was calculated as total consumption and by type
of fish consumed; a) tuna, b) predator fish (shark and
swordfish), c) marine fish (fish sticks, haddock, mackerel,
porgy, salmon, sardines, sea bass, unknown, other un-
known, pollock and flatfish) d) freshwater fish (catfish,
perch, pike, trout, bass and walleye) and e) marine shell-
fish (crab, crayfish, lobster, mussels, oyster, scallops,
shrimp, other shellfish, unknown other shellfish).
Blood mercury data
The NHANES data files contain data on total blood
mercury (tHg) and blood inorganic mercury (iHg). The
analytical method for measuring tHg in blood has been
described in detail by the NCHS [12]. Briefly, tHg was
measured using cold-vapor atomic absorption spectro-
photometry with a detection limit of 0.14 μg/L. As 90–
95% of mercury found in fish is methylmercury, tHg can
be assumed to represent methylmercury [10]. Methyl-
mercury in blood (MeHg) is calculated by subtracting
iHg from tHg. Since the limit of detection (LOD) for
iHg is larger than the LOD for tHg this approach may
result in negative values. To address this problem, we
followed the protocols described by Mahaffey et al.
(2009) where MeHg = tHg - iHg if the difference is ≥ 0. If
the difference is < 0, MeHg = 0.2 μg/L which is one half.
If it is assumed that MeHg has the same LOD as iHg,
then MeHg can be set equal to the LOD of iHg. We
opted to conduct analysis using MeHg and tHg as the
dependent variable [8]. Both models displayed similar

 trends and associations, thus we only report the results
for total mercury. Of the 9,597 blood tHg measurements
included in this analysis, 11% of the tHg measurements
were below the limit of detection. Values below the level
of detection limit were imputed by using a value equal
to the detection limit divided by the square root of two.
Geographical data
We hypothesized that fish consumption patterns would
vary between residents who lived on or near the coast com-
pared to those living inland. We also hypothesized that the
type and quantity of fish consumed would vary by specific
coast (ie., the types of fish consumed on the Pacific coast
will be different than those consumed on the Gulf of
Mexico). The participant’s county or county equivalent was
used to categorize participants into four census regions and
eight different regional groups: Atlantic Coast, Northeast,
Great Lakes, Midwest, South, Gulf of Mexico, West and
Pacific Coast. Additionally, we categorized participants as
coastal or noncoastal. Any county that bordered the Pacific
Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, or the Great
Lakes was considered coastal. Additionally, any county
whose center point was within 25 miles of any coast was
also considered coastal (See Additional file 1: Table S1 for a
list of coastal counties) and was classified based on its prox-
imity to the nearest largest water body.
Covariates
Demographic data were included in the analysis as po-
tential confounders including: race/ethnicity (Non-His-
panic
White,
Non-Hispanic
Black,
Other
Hispanic,
Mexican American and Other (which included Asians,
Pacific Islanders, Native Americans and Alaska Natives),
age (16–19, 20–29, 30–39 and 40–49 years of age),
household income (<$20,000, $20,000-$44,999, $45,000-
$74,999 and $75,000+), and survey cycle year.
Statistical analysis
Population prevalence estimates for each census and
coastal region were obtained for blood mercury levels ≥
5.8
μg/L
and ≥ 3.5
μg/L
using
appropriate
sample
weights, in order to determine the percentage of the
population that has blood mercury levels greater than
those are considered to be of concern for women of re-
productive age. Blood mercury levels were natural log
transformed
to
approximate
a
normal
distribution.
Bivariate linear regression models were used to examine
the relationship between ln tHg (as a continuous vari-
able) and cycle year, fish consumption, age, race/ethni-
city, household income, type of fish and region of
residence. Covariates that had an alpha >0.05 were then
included in multivariate linear regression models.
Linear regression models were used to assess the
relationship between tHg blood concentrations as a
continuous variable and survey cycle year. Additional
linear regression models were also used to evaluate the
association between blood mercury concentrations and
30-day fish and shellfish consumption (total and by type
of fish) controlling for race/ethnicity; income; time, geo-
graphical location and age. Temporal changes in tHg
and fish consumption were evaluated using ANOVA and
Tukey test.
Following NCHS guidance, the weights provided by
NCHS were combined and weighted for all analyses re-
ported in this study to account for the complex sampling
design [12]. All analyses were performed using SAS,
version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Overall, blood mercury levels were observed to differ by
region and coastal status in the US. The percentage of
women by geographic census region and coastal status
that had Hg concentrations ≥ 3.5 μg/L and ≥ 5.8 μg/L be-
tween 1999–2010 are presented in Table 1. In general,
women in the Northeast had the highest percentage of
blood Hg concentrations with 6.48% ≥ 5.8 μg/L and
15.21% ≥ 3.5 μg/L while women in the Midwest had the
lowest
percentages
(0.78
and
2.64%
respectively).
Additionally, when blood Hg was evaluated as a continu-
ous variable, mean blood Hg concentrations were also
observed to differ by region and coastal status for U.S.
women of childbearing age across all survey cycles
(Fig. 1; Additional file 1: Table S1). Overall, women
living in coastal regions had higher geometric mean Hg
levels (1.12 μg/L; 95% CI 1.05 μg/L,1.20 μg/L) compared
to those living in non-coastal areas (0.74 μg/L; 95% CI
0.70 μg/L −0.78 μg/L). Additionally, women living in the
Atlantic and Pacific coastal region had the highest geo-
metric mean Hg concentration of 2.41 μg/L, (95% CI
2.13 μg/L – 2.69 μg/L) and 1.97 μg/L, (95% CI 1.75 μg/L
−2.19 μg/L), respectively. Women in the inland Midwest
had the lowest geometric mean Hg concentrations of
0.94 μg/L (95% CI 0.88 μg/L −1.01 μg/L).
There was a statistically significant decrease in the
mean blood mercury concentrations in 2009–2010 as
compared to 1999–2000 (Fig. 2 and Additional file 1:
Table S2). While there was no apparent decreasing trend
over time, mean tHg levels in 1999–2000 were 1.96 ug/L
(95% CI: 1.50, 2.42) compared to 1.39 ug/L L (95% CI:
1.26, 1.53).
Fish consumption was the most frequent in the Atlan-
tic, Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific regions (see Fig. 3
and Additional file 1: Table S3). Fish species consumed
also varied by region. In all regions except the Inland
West and Inland Midwest, shellfish was the most com-
monly consumed item. Freshwater fish was most often
consumed by women living in the Gulf of Mexico
coastal region and the least often consumed in the

 Inland Northeast. Marine fish was most often consumed
by women living in the Pacific Coast and the least often
by women in the Gulf of Mexico region. Tuna consump-
tion was fairly similar in the Great Lakes, Inland
Midwest and Inland Northeast and the lowest consump-
tion was found in the Gulf of Mexico. Shellfish was con-
sumed in the greatest frequency in the Gulf of Mexico
and consumed the least in the Great Lakes. Swordfish
and shark were consumed by less than 1% of all women
in all regions (Additional file 1: Table S2).
The mean weighted frequency of fish consumption in
the past 30 days for each survey cycle is displayed in
Additional file 1: Table S2. The total number of times
fish was consumed by US women of childbearing age
differed across the six survey cycles (p = 0.05). Compared
to 1999–2000, U.S. women consumed on average one
additional fish meal per 30 days in the survey cycle
2009–2010 (Fig. 4 and Additional file 1: Table S2). The
percentage of U.S. women who reported not eating any
fish in the past month in the 2009–2010 cycle has de-
creased since 1999–2000 (23% compared to 26%). While
there was no consistent trend over time, this data indi-
cated that U.S. women of reproductive age, on average,
were consuming more fish per month in 2009–2010
compared to 1999–2000. The data also showed that the
frequency of marine fish consumption (p = 0.01) and
shellfish consumption (p = 0.02) had increased slightly
each year since 1999 with the exception of 2007–2008.
Yet there was no appreciable difference in the mean
number of times freshwater fish (p = 0.24), tuna (p = 0.09)
or predatory fish (p = 0.55) were consumed over this time
frame.
Age, income, and race/ethnicity were associated with
higher fish consumption in bivariate analysis. Specifically,
as age increased so did total fish consumption (β 0.08,
95% CI: 0.06,0.09) (Additional file 1: Table S3). Age was

 also associated with an increase in consumption of marine
fish (p < 0.01), freshwater fish (p < 0.01), tuna (p < 0.01)
and shellfish (p < 0.01). A categorical increase in total
household income was associated with a statistically sig-
nificant increased total fish consumption (p < 0.01), mar-
ine fish (p < 0.01), tuna (p < 0.01), shellfish (p < 0.01),
freshwater fish (p = 0.02) and swordfish/shark (p = 0.05).
Finally, participants who self-identified as ‘Other’ (Asian-
Americans, Pacific Islanders, Alaska Natives and Native
Americans) consumed the greatest amount of total fish
per month (6.4 ± 8.8) and Mexican Americans were con-
suming the least fish per month (3.0 ± 4.1). The ‘Other’
category consumed the greatest amount of marine fish in
the last 30-days and Mexican Americans consumed the
least amount. Freshwater fish was consumed the most by
Non-Hispanic Blacks in the last 30 days and consumed
the least by Hispanics. Tuna was consumed the most fre-
quently by Non-Hispanic whites and by Non-Hispanic
Blacks the least. Swordfish/shark was consumed the most
by frequently by Non-Hispanic whites and by Non-
Hispanic Blacks the least. Shellfish was consumed the
most frequently by the ‘Other’ category and the least by
Mexican Americans (see Fig. 5, Additional file 1: Table
S2).
Blood Hg concentrations were associated with income,
age, race/ethnicity, total fish, and region. Blood Hg con-
centrations increased with increasing age and income,
with those with a household income of ≥ $75,000 having
higher Hg concentrations (β = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.26,0.61)
than those reporting a household income less than
$20,000. Mexican Americans had the lowest Hg concen-
trations (β = −0.09, 95% CI: −0.21,0.02) compared to
Non-Hispanic Whites. On average, people who self-i-
dentified as ‘Other’ race had more Hg in their blood (β
= 1.03, 95% CI: 0.65,1.40) compared to those in the
Non-Hispanic
White
category.

(β = −0.43, 95% CI: −0.77,–0.09), compared to Inland
South in adjusted models while controlling for the same
covariates (Table 2).
Discussion
The current study observed that U.S. women of child-
bearing age who live in coastal regions consumed more
fish per month and had higher whole blood Hg concen-
trations compared to women living in the Midwest after
controlling for other confounders. In particular, women
who lived in the Atlantic or Pacific coastal regions had
the highest fish intake and the highest blood Hg
concentrations. These results are consistent with other
studies which have observed differences in mercury ex-
posure even within a single state due to location of resi-
dence (coastal/non-coastal), type of fish consumed, and
consumption rates [1, 22–24]. Compared to the results
of a previous study by Mahaffey et al. (2009), who exam-
ined women of childbearing age using NHANES data
from 1999–2004, we saw a modest decrease in the geo-
metric mean blood mercury concentrations for women
residing in the Atlantic coast, from 1.55 μg/L to 1.35 μg/
L, and the Gulf of Mexico, from 0.96 μg/L to 0.88 μg/L,
but a modest increase for women residing in the Inland
Northeast from 0.77 μg/L to 0.85 μg/L and no change in
other regions when adding in the additional 2005–2010
NHANES survey cycles [10].
Women living in coastal areas were at greater risk of
having blood mercury concentrations higher than the
5.8 μg/L reference level (6.1 vs 1.8% for non-coastal
areas). Women living in the Northeast were at the great-
est risk for having blood mercury concentrations greater

 than 5.8 μg/L (6.5%), compared to the other census re-
gions. The reference level is the equilibrium blood mer-
cury level that is associated with a dietary intake of
methylmercury at the current reference dose of 0.1 μg/
kg-bw/day. This reference level defines the long-term
average level of mercury in blood that was judged to be
without appreciable risk. However, recent research and a
re-analysis of the data used to determine the reference
dose (0.1 μg/kg-bw/day) has challenged the appropriate-
ness of this reference level [7, 16]. Since more recent re-
search strongly suggests that the current reference level
may be the level of exposure at which adverse effects
begin to be observed, the amended level of 3.5 μg/L sug-
gested by previous researchers may be a more relevant
benchmark for comparison until an updated reference
dose is determined. Using 3.5 μg/L, we saw similar, yet
more pronounced, patterns. Women in the Northeast
were still at the greatest risk, with 15.21% greater than
the suggested reference level. Women living in coastal
regions were still at greater risk of having blood mercury
concentrations greater than the suggested 3.5 μg/L level
compared to the non-coastal areas.
Importantly, we also observed that total monthly fish
consumption by U.S. women of reproductive age was
higher in recent years. Specifically, in 2009–2010 marine
and shellfish consumption had increased by approxi-
mately one additional fish meal per month compared to
1999–2000 yet consumption of freshwater fish, tuna and
swordfish/shark had decreased slightly over time. This is
encouraging considering that the consumption of marine
and shellfish was associated with the smallest increase in
total whole blood mercury 0.08 (95%CI: 0.01,0.15) and
0.09 (95%CI: 0.06,0.12), respectively. Notably, there was
also a statistically significant decrease in mean whole
blood mercury levels between 1999–2000 and 2009–
2010.
On average women who ate fish at a greater frequency
(9+ times in the past month) in 2009–2010 had lower
blood mercury levels than women who ate fish at the
same rate in 1999–2000. Women who ate fish 9+ times
in the past 30 days in 2009–2010 had an arithmetic
mean blood mercury level of 2.4 μg/L (95%CI: 2.1,2.7),
compared to 4.1 μg/L (95%CI: 3.5,4.7), in 1999–2000 in
a bivariate analysis.
The observed increase in fish consumption and corre-
sponding decrease in blood mercury levels may be
attributed to several different possibilities. In the most
recent survey cycle (2009–2010) 34% of the fish con-
sumption was from marine fish, 18% from tuna, 42%
from shellfish, 5% from fresh water fish and lest than a
quarter percent from swordfish or shark. Swordfish and
shark have the strongest association with increase in
blood mercury levels (β1.80, 95%CI: 0.57,3.01) followed
by tuna and freshwater fish. However they account for
such a small percentage of the fish being consumed in
the U.S., it seems unlikely that the consumption of these
species is affecting blood mercury levels nationally. The
decline
in
women's
blood
mercury
levels
in
the
NHANES samples may have been driven largely or in
part by market changes; for example, over the decade
studied, market shares for low-mercury varieties includ-
ing shrimp, tilapia, salmon and catfish have increased
dramatically, while shares of high-mercury varieties were
decreasing, as did consumption of those high-mercury
fish by women of childbearing age, as already noted.
Tuna is of particular interest, since in 2014 it accounted
for 14% of the US seafood market (FDA 2014). It is
therefore plausible that differences in consumption of
tuna fish among regions or age or ethnic groups might
be associated with differences in blood mercury levels. If
so, that would have major implications for seafood con-
sumption advice.
Consistent with other studies, we found that as age
and income increases, fish consumption was increasing
[25, 26]. However, the 40–49 years women had lower
blood mercury concentrations than the 30–39 years olds.
Older women (40–49 years) are also consuming more
total
fish (5.1 meals/month) compared to younger
women (15–19 years: 2.6 meals/month) and consuming
more swordfish/shark and freshwater fish as compared
to the younger age categories. As fish consumption advi-
sories are typically aimed at women of childbearing age,
it is possible that older women, who no longer plan on
bearing children, may not pay heed to fish consumption

 advice if they feel the advice no longer pertains to them.
Advice still needs to focus on encouraging younger
women to consume more fish that is low in mercury
and in high omega 3 as 36.8% of the women aged 16–19
and 24.1% of women aged 20–29 were consuming no
fish at all.
We also found that, similar to previous studies, those
who identified as Alaska Native/American Indian, Pacific
Islander, Caribbean Islander or Asian (“Other” race/eth-
nicity” category) consumed the most fish per month and
had the highest blood mercury levels, but 80% of the
reported fish consumption was from marine or shellfish
[26]. Mexican Americans ate the least amount of fish
per month and had the lowest blood mercury levels. 70%
of the fish they consumed was marine or shellfish. Look-
ing at geographic differences in fish consumption, the
Atlantic coast was consuming the most total fish per
month with the majority being marine and shellfish. An
increase in household income was also associated with
greater fish consumption as well as blood mercury
levels. Geographic differences may occur as a result of
fresh fish being more available in coastal areas and be-
cause the cuisine in coastal areas emphasizes fish more
so than inland cuisine [22].
Geographic-specific and demographic data are import-
ant in order to develop meaningful fish consumption ad-
visories. Fish consumption advisories are frequently
based on nationally aggregated estimates of methylmer-
cury concentrations found in fish as well as fish con-
sumption rates representing a specific population, such
as women of child bearing age [25]. Determining the
site-specific contributions to mercury in the environ-
ment, as well as the specific fish being consumed by the
local population would be beneficial particularly in an
area such as the northeastern part of the US and along
the Atlantic coast, where there are both higher blood
mercury concentrations and fish consumption. Specific
demographic groups are also more susceptible to mer-
cury toxicity due to age, race/ethnicity, cultural identity
and practices, and coastal proximity [8, 27–30]. Fish
consumption advisories need to be tailored to reflect the
fish consumption habits of the population at being tar-
geted or for those at risk.
Research has demonstrated that fish consumption ad-
visories are often not reported effectively. Recent studies
have found that awareness of advisories was lowest
among women and in particular pregnant women, non-
White ethnic groups, senior citizens, people age 15–19,
low income and people with less than a high school
education [22, 28, 31]. Researchers in California found
that awareness of the advisory does not guarantee that
the information provided is understood or accepted [31].
The targeted audience may disregard the advice for
several reasons; the advice may contradict long held
cultural beliefs, or they may be unconcerned about the
potential health effects, or find that the evidence for
harm is lacking [31–37]. Often times the fish consump-
tion advisories focus on the fish species that are the
highest risk for methylmercury exposure and do not
include examples of species which are low in methyl-
mercury and high in polyunsaturated fats. This method
undermines the health and nutritional benefits of fish
consumption and in turn, women of reproductive age
may be lacking the nutritional benefits garnered from
fish. The information needs to be presented in a
balanced way to enhance the acceptance and to prevent
complete avoidance of such an important food group.
Often times State agencies issue lengthy and detailed
advisories that have been difficult for ethnically diverse
groups and non-English speakers to interpret [31, 38, 39].
Advice that is appropriate for Asians may not be applic-
able to Native Americans, or, species and quantities con-
sumed by Koreans may be very different from those
consumed by Vietnamese people. The ‘Other’ category in
the NHANES survey, includes a diverse mix of racial
groups. When crafting fish consumption advisories, care
must be taken to ensure that the information is appropri-
ate for the varied fish consumption preferences and habits
of these subgroups.
Despite the general increased trend in fish consump-
tion, only 21% of U.S. women in 2009–2010 consumed
fish at a rate of twice a week (8–12 oz/week) as recom-
mended by the most recently updated Dietary Guideline
for Americans (DGA, 2015). The updated guidelines
urge women of childbearing age to eat 8–12 oz of fish
per week and provides a list of nine seafood varieties
that are both high in omega-3 s and low in mercury
(DGA, 2015). While this percentage is significantly
higher than 1999–2000 in which only 12% of the popu-
lation was consuming fish at the recommended rate,
women of reproductive age may be lacking the nutri-
tional benefits garnered from fish. Lando et al. found
similar results in which nearly all women in their study
consumed much less than the current recommendations
and pregnant and postpartum women may not be eating
enough low mercury fish in order to gain the benefits of
fish consumption [22]. Ways need to be found to
encourage all women to consume more fish that is low
in mercury and high in omega three fatty acids. Fish are
an excellent source of high quality protein, they contain
vitamins and other essential nutrients, as well as high
levels of omega-3 poly unsaturated fats [40]. Improve-
ment
in
fetal
outcomes
such
as
longer
gestation,
increased birth weight and benefits in fetal brain devel-
opment has been reported for women who consume fish
during pregnancy [1, 41].
As discussed by Groth, fish consumption advisories
need to clearly delineate which fish species can be
Cusack et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:10 
Page 9 of 11
 consumed often, or conversely, should be avoided [7].
Rather than solely focusing on species to avoid, it would
be useful to provide a broad range of fish that are low in
methylmercury and high in omega 3 s as well. This list
should be comprehensive to not only include fish that
may be consumed by a range of different ethnic groups,
but fish that may also be specific to geographic regions.
An improvement in the reporting of fish consumption
advisories is necessary and could be achieved by provid-
ing informational material to health clinics, pediatri-
cians, and gynecologists in order to reach the high risk
populations [28].
While our study has many strengths including the use
of 6 cycles of NHANES data that collected questionnaire
data and biomarker data using the same methods across
each cycle coupled with the restricted geographical data,
there were also limitations that are worth noting. For in-
stance, we used a 30-day food recall questionnaire to
ascertain fish intake. This length of recall could intro-
duce misclassification and has potential for bias. How-
ever, this questionnaire was used consistently across all
cycles and consequently should be internally valid since
it is unlikely that the recall bias that is inherent in food
frequency questionnaires would differ from one survey
cycle to the next. In addition, fish and shellfish are gen-
erally easily identifiable foods and therefore more readily
recalled than other food groups [8]. Additionally, the
validity of the dietary recall for fish consumption has
been found to be greater than for all other food groups
[42, 43]. However, the questionnaire only collected data
on frequency and thus we do not know amounts
consumed nor were we able to determine if portion sizes
changed over time.
Conclusion
Fish advisories are tasked with balancing the benefits of
fish consumption with reducing the risk of mercury ex-
posure. While it appears that whole blood mercury levels
are decreasing and fish consumption is increasing over
time, a substantial number of women of reproductive
age in the U.S. still have blood mercury levels that are
above those recommended by the EPA’s current refer-
ence level and even more are above the suggested level
of 3.5 μg/L. A large portion are not eating fish twice a
week as recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans. Risk managers and physicians need to con-
sider the target demographics for fish consumption advi-
sories, how populations will respond to fish these
advisories, how those responses will influence nutrient
intake and methylmercury exposure, and the affect this
will in turn have on public health [44]. An emphasis
needs to be on providing women of reproductive ages
with advice that highlights the positive benefits of fish
consumption,
particularly
during
pregnancy,
and
provides examples of fish that are low in mercury and
high in omega 3 s, rather than simply pointing out the
fish that are high in mercury. The advisories need to be
broad to include fish consumed by a range of ethnically
diverse populations, and as region-specific as possible.
