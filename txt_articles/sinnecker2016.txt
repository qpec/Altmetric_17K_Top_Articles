ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of cardiac vagal modulation, provides cardiac risk
stratification information. RSA can be quantified from Holter recordings as the high-frequency component of heart rate
variability or as the variability of RR intervals in individual respiratory cycles. However, as a risk predictor, RSA is neither
exceptionally sensitive nor specific.
OBJECTIVES This study aimed to improve RSA determination by quantifying the amount of sinus arrhythmia related to
expiration (expiration-triggered sinus arrhythmia [ETA]) from short-term recordings of electrocardiogram and respiratory
chest excursions, and investigated the predictive power of ETA in survivors of acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS Survivors of acute myocardial infarction (N ¼ 941) underwent 30-min recordings of electrocardiogram and
respiratory chest excursions. ETA was quantified as the RR interval change associated with expiration by phase-rectified
signal averaging. Primary outcome was 5-year all-cause mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression was used
to investigate the association of ETA with mortality.
RESULTS ETA was a strong predictor of mortality, both in univariable and multivariable analysis. In a multivariable
model including respiratory rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, and GRACE score, ETA #0.19 ms was
associated with a hazard ratio of 3.41 (95% confidence interval: 1.10 to 5.89, p < 0.0001). In patient subgroups defined
by abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, increased respiratory rate, high GRACE score, or presence of diabetes
mellitus, patients were classified as high or low risk on the basis of ETA.
CONCLUSIONS Expiration-triggered sinus arrhythmia (ETA) is a potent and independent post-infarction risk marker.

R
espiratory
sinus
arrhythmia
(RSA)—first
described by Carl Ludwig more than 150
years ago (1)—is caused by phasic changes of
vagal neural discharge directed to the sinus node.
During inspiration, vagal activity is inhibited, causing
a prompt heart rate increase. During expiration, the
pattern of vagal discharge resumes, causing a prompt
heart rate decrease (2,3). Thus, the extent of the
corresponding heart rate changes is largely depen-
dent on vagal modulation.
RSA is therefore a major determinant of heart rate
variability
(HRV),
particularly
when
considering
short-term HRV. RSA decrease is commonly observed
in conditions characterized by altered sympathovagal
balance with reduced vagal and increased sympa-
thetic neural activity. In many clinical conditions

 (e.g., myocardial infarction [MI], heart fail-
ure), this autonomic pattern has been asso-
ciated with a poor prognosis (4).
Various parameters have been proposed
for RSA quantification and its use as a pre-
dictor for subsequent mortality in cardiac
patients
(5,6).
Commonly,
these
markers
quantify the HRV within entire respiratory
cycles. We present a method that addresses
heart
rate
changes
mediated
by
the
expiration-driven increase of vagal activity.
For this purpose, we used bivariate phase-
rectified signal averaging (7,8) technology
to quantify fluctuations of heartbeat inter-
vals
triggered
by
expiration.
We
term
such fluctuations expiration-triggered sinus
arrhythmia (ETA). We also investigated the prog-
nostic power of this parameter for risk stratification of
survivors of acute MI.
METHODS
STUDY COHORT. From May 2000 to March 2005, 941
consecutive survivors of acute MI were enrolled at 2
university hospitals (Deutsches Herzzentrum Mün-
chen and Klinikum Rechts der Isar, both in Munich,
Germany). The study protocol was approved by the
local ethics committee, and all participants gave
written informed consent.
Patients
were
eligible
for
the
study
if
they
were #80 years of age, survived the acute MI phase,
presented in sinus rhythm, and did not meet criteria
for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implanta-
tion
for
secondary
prevention
before
hospital
discharge. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years, with the
last follow-up performed in August 2010. The primary
endpoint of the study was all-cause mortality within 5
years after the index MI. Patients were followed up
with clinical appointments every 6 months. If pa-
tients did not attend, they were contacted by letter,
by telephone, or through their general practitioner. If
this was not successful, the local population registry
office was contacted to trace their new address or to
identify those who died.
DATA RECORDINGS. Within 2 weeks of their index MI
and during the initial hospitalization, patients under-
went 30-min recordings of high-resolution electro-
cardiograms (ECGs) (1.6 kHz in orthogonal XYZ leads,
TMS International, Enschede, the Netherlands) and
respiratory activity (Pro-Tech piezoelectric thoracic
sensor, signal acquired at 1.6 kHz, Porti system,
TMS International). To avoid disturbing spontaneous
respiration, patients were not reminded that a sensor
was attached to monitor respiration (although they
initially consented to their ECG, arterial pressure, and
respiration being monitored). Recordings were made
in the morning after administration of routine medi-
cations, in a supine resting position in a quiet sur-
rounding. In analogy to the standards of Holter ECG
analysis (9), raw signals were reviewed, artefacts were
eliminated where needed, and QRS classifications
were carefully reviewed and manually corrected when
appropriate. This post-processing, which typically
took <5 min, was performed by an experienced tech-
nician unaware of the clinical outcome data.
ASSESSMENT OF RSA. A mathematical representa-
tion of the respiratory signal (analytical respiratory
signal) was constructed, ranging from �1 (beginning
of inspiration) to þ1 (end of expiration) (Figure 1). The
expiratory phase was defined as the time interval
between 2 threshold values: f1 and f2. For compu-
tation of ETA, heartbeat intervals starting between f1
and f2 were identified as anchors. About 700 of 2,000
RR intervals become anchors in a typical 30-min
recording. RR interval segments around the anchors
were selected and averaged. The average change in
RR intervals was quantified by Haar wavelet analysis
with a scale of 2 (8).
The numerical values of f1 and f2 (0.6 and �0.1,
respectively) were optimized with respect to predic-
tion of 5-year all-cause mortality, as assessed by
receiver-operating
characteristic
(ROC)
analysis
(details are presented in the Online Appendix).
Figure
2A
shows
a
typical
phase-rectified
and
averaged RR interval tachogram centered on expira-
tory RR intervals in a long-term MI survivor. A posi-
tive central deflection is clearly visible, indicating
that, on average, expiration leads to RR interval
prolongation (i.e., heart rate decrease) (Figure 2A). By
contrast, Figure 2B shows an averaged tachogram of a
patient who died during follow-up. In nonsurvivors,
the central deflection was typically less pronounced
or even negative.
RSA was also assessed by 2 standard methods:
a
spectral
analytic
technique,
that
is,
the
high-
frequency component of HRV—RSAHF, and a peak-
to-trough algorithm that estimates RSA from the
variability of RR intervals in individual respiratory
cycles—RSAPT. For calculation of RSAHF, the high-
frequency (0.15 to 0.40 Hz) component of HRV was
obtained by fast Fourier transformation in 5-min seg-
ments of the RR interval time series, and RSAHF was
calculated as the average of all segments (5). For the
calculation of RSAPT, inspiratory and expiratory pha-
ses of each respiratory cycle were analyzed separately,

 and the minimum RR interval during inspiration was
subtracted from the maximum RR interval during
expiration. RSAPT was calculated as the average of
these differences over all respiratory cycles (6).
DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL VARIABLES. For the
initial MI diagnosis, at least 2 of the following 3
criteria were required: typical chest pain for at least
20-min duration, creatine kinase above twice the

The respiratory signal is transformed into an analytical signal. All RR intervals that lie within the expiratory phase (i.e., between the threshold
values f1 and f2 in the analytical signal) are used as anchor points for the subsequent phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA). Electrocar-
diogram (ECG) segments around these anchor points are aligned by the anchors and subsequently averaged.

Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed if a patient was
already receiving treatment (diet, tablets, or insulin)
or if fasting blood glucose concentration repeatedly
exceeded 11 mmol/l. GRACE score (a clinical score
combining patient age, serum creatinine, past MI,
past heart failure, in-hospital percutaneous coronary
intervention, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, ST-
segment
deviation,
and
positive
enzymes)
was
assessed as previously proposed for the prediction of
long-term prognosis (10).

(LVEF)
was
assessed by angiography (n ¼ 445; 47.3%) or biplane
echocardiography according to Simpson’s method
(n ¼ 496; 52.7%; Sonos 5500, Hewlett Packard, Palo
Alto, California) within the first 2 weeks (median 7
days, interquartile range [IQR]: 5 to 9 days) after the
index MI.
EVALUATION OF RISK PREDICTORS. In the primary
analysis, ETA, respiration rate, LVEF, and GRACE
score were treated as continuous variables. In the
secondary analysis, ETA was dichotomized at the
optimum cutoff according to Youden’s index J (i.e.,
maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity) (11).
Other variables were dichotomized prospectively:
respiratory frequency at 18.6 breaths/min (12,13), LVEF
at 35% (14), and the GRACE score at 120 points (15).
STATISTICS. Continuous variables are presented as
median and IQR. Categorical data are expressed as
absolute frequencies and percentages. Cox propor-
tional hazards models were used with all variables
entered simultaneously to assess the independence
and prognostic value of mortality predictors. Sur-
vival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method and compared using the log-rank test. To
assess the intradata reproducibility of the findings,
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and areas under the
ROC curves were calculated together with their con-
fidence intervals (CIs) obtained by bootstrap with
10,000 repetitions. Differences were considered sta-
tistically significant if p < 0.05 (IBM SPSS Statistics
20.0, SPSS, Armonk, New York).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows clinical and demographic characteris-
tics of the enrolled patients. Five years after the index
MI, 72 patients (7.7%) had died.
ETA AS A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE. Median ETA in
the cohort was 0.54 ms (IQR: �0.25 to 1.66 ms). In
patients
who
died
during
follow-up,
ETA
was
significantly
smaller
compared
with
that
of
the
survivors: �0.35 (�1.33 to 0.30) ms versus 0.64 (�0.16
to 1.75) ms (p < 0.0001). The area under the ROC
curve for all-cause mortality prediction by ETA was
0.72 (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.78).
In univariable Cox analysis, ETA was a significant
predictor of outcome. An increase of ETA by 1 ms was
associated with a hazard ratio of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90 to
0.97; p ¼ 0.001) (Table 2). Respiratory rate, LVEF,
presence of diabetes mellitus, and GRACE score also
were
significant
predictors
of
all-cause
mortality
(Table 2). In multivariable Cox analysis considering all
the aforementioned risk predictors, the association of
ETA with mortality remained statistically significant,
with a hazard ratio of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91 to 0.99; p ¼
0.035) (Table 2).
Performance of the standard methods for RSA
assessment was much weaker, with areas under the
ROC curve of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.49 to 0.64) and 0.62
(95% CI: 0.55 to 0.69) for RSAHF and RSAPT, respec-
tively; neither parameter reached statistical signifi-
cance in univariable Cox analysis.

 ETA AS A DICHOTOMOUS VARIABLE. According to
Youden’s index J, the optimum dichotomy for ETA
was 0.19 ms. In univariable Cox analysis, the hazard
ratio for ETA #0.19 ms versus >0.19 ms was 5.12 (95%
CI: 3.00 to 8.73; p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival
probability curves of patients with ETA values above
and below this threshold are shown in the Central
Illustration together with their CIs. Five-year mortal-
ity rates in the high- and low-risk groups were 15%
and 3%, respectively. In multivariable Cox analysis,
ETA #0.19 ms remained a strong risk predictor (with a
hazard ratio of 3.43; 95% CI: 1.10 to 5.89; p < 0.0001)
(Table 3). Upon addition of ETA to a model comprising
respiratory rate, LVEF, presence of diabetes mellitus,
and GRACE score, the area under the ROC curve
increased significantly from 0.79 to 0.82 (p ¼ 0.02)
(Online Figure 1).
Figure 3 shows Kaplan-Meier survival probability
curves for combinations of dichotomized ETA with
dichotomized LVEF, respiratory rate, GRACE score,
and presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. In all
cases, the addition of ETA led to strong separation of
survival curves. Within patient subgroups defined by
abnormal LVEF, respiratory rate, GRACE score, or
presence of diabetes mellitus, ETA >0.19 ms was
consistently associated with a considerably improved
prognosis, and vice versa for ETA #0.19 ms (Table 4,
Central Illustration).
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that ETA is a potent risk
marker in post-infarction patients. ETA is particularly
strong in patients with reduced LVEF (Figure 3A). This
observation is of clinical importance, because risk
stratification in patients with reduced LVEF has so far
been very challenging. ETA allows for further risk
stratification, not only in patients pre-stratified by
LVEF, but also by other accepted risk predictors such
as GRACE score, presence of diabetes mellitus, or
respiratory rate, with hazard ratios between 3 and 5
(Table 4). Moreover, ETA is independent of a number
of established risk markers, including late potentials
in signal-averaged ECGs (16), heart rate turbulence
(17), deceleration capacity (18), spontaneous barore-
flex sensitivity (15,19), post-extrasystolic blood pres-
sure potentiation (20), and periodic repolarization
dynamics
(21)
(Online
Appendix),
and
standard
methods of RSA assessment, that is, RSAHF and
RSAPT, were by far not as strong as ETA. The predic-
tive power of ETA was independent from b-blocker
use, as well as from infarct localization (Online
Appendix).
We understand that ETA extracts the effects of the
expiration-triggered vagal surge on the sinus node
discharge rate. Because attenuated vagal function is
apparent already at early stages of left ventricular
dysfunction (22), ETA seems particularly suitable for
risk stratification purposes. Also, the phase-rectified
signal
averaging
method
makes
ETA
assessment
robust and practically independent of noise and
nonstationarities.
ETA
is
ideally
assessed
during
spontaneous breathing, because controlled breathing
may change the sympathovagal balance (23).
Inspiration-triggered sinus arrhythmia derived by
an ETA-analogous parameter that uses inspiration
segments for the selection of anchor RR intervals was
also a significant mortality predictor, albeit at a lower
statistical significance level as compared with ETA
(data not shown).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. This study only included post-
infarction patients age 80 years and younger. Our
results might thus not translate to other patient
populations.
The respiration signal was obtained using a chest
belt, that is, by a method not regularly used in clinical
routine. However, respiratory cycles and respiration
phases can be identified in high-resolution ECG sig-
nals alone (24). Broad applications of ETA are thus
technically feasible.
Although the ETA assessment method was opti-
mized to achieve large areas under the ROC curve of
mortality prediction, the dependency of the areas

 under the ROC curve on the values of f1 and f2 was
rather shallow (Online Figure 2).
The primary endpoint of the study was all-cause
mortality. With respect to cardiac mortality, we ob-
tained similar results as with all-cause mortality, albeit
at a lower statistical significance level. The number of
sudden cardiac deaths in our study was too small to
perform multivariable analyses considering multiple
risk factors in addition to ETA (25,26). However, in
pairwise multivariable analyses, ETA appeared to also
predict sudden cardiac death independently of other
risk predictors (Online Appendix, Online Figure 3).
CONCLUSIONS
ETA appears to be a potent risk marker in post-
infarction patients. The association of ETA and mor-
tality is independent of other established risk factors,
indicating that inclusion of ETA in risk stratification
models
will
significantly
improve
the
predictive
power of these models.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: ETA,
determined by signal-averaged ECG-derived RR interval
tachograms gated to the respiratory cycle, reflects the
influence of vagal tone on heart rate. Attenuation of ETA,
reflecting less respiratory variation in heart rate, is a strong,
independent predictor of mortality in survivors of MI.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future investigations
should address the mechanisms relating ETA to clinical
outcomes among MI survivors and explore interventions
that might reduce mortality in those with impaired reflex
activity.
