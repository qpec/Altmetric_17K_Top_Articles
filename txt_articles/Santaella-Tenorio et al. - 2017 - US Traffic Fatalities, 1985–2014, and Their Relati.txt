Abstract
Objectives—To determine the association of medical marijuana laws (MMLs) with traffic 
fatality rates.
Methods—Using data from the 1985–2014 Fatality Analysis Reporting System, we examined the 
association between MMLs and traffic fatalities in multilevel regression models while controlling 
for contemporaneous secular trends. We examined this association separately for each state

 enacting MMLs. We also evaluated the association between marijuana dispensaries and traffic 
fatalities.
Results—On average, MML states had lower traffic fatality rates than non-MML states. Medical 
marijuana laws were associated with immediate reductions in traffic fatalities in those aged 15 to 
24 and 25 to 44 years, and with additional yearly gradual reductions in those aged 25 to 44 years. 
However, state-specific results showed that only 7 states experienced post-MML reductions. 
Dispensaries were also associated with traffic fatality reductions in those aged 25 to 44 years.
Conclusions—Both MMLs and dispensaries were associated with reductions in traffic fatalities, 
especially among those aged 25 to 44 years. State-specific analysis showed heterogeneity of the 
MML–traffic fatalities association, suggesting moderation by other local factors. These findings 
could influence policy decisions on the enactment or repealing of MMLs and how they are 
implemented.
In the past 2 decades, 23 US states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws allowing 
the use of cannabis (marijuana) to treat certain medical conditions.1 Despite potential 
benefits of legislation protecting the medical use of marijuana, concern is increasing that 
medical marijuana laws (MMLs) may increase nonmedical marijuana use and the number of 
individuals driving under the influence of marijuana, and thus increase the rate of traffic 
injuries.2
Some simulator and on-road experimental studies show a dose-dependent association 
between marijuana exposure and several indicators of driving impairment.3 Studies show 
that marijuana exposure is associated with increased response time and lane weaving.4,5 In 
addition, it has been associated with impairment in other complex tasks requiring 
neurocognitive and neuromotor skills6,7 that are likely to be involved in driving safely. 
Marijuana exposure has also been associated with reduced speed and greater headway,4,8 
which indicates some degree of awareness of marijuana-related impairment and a tendency 
to compensate.8
Despite these observations, population-based data have not shown an increase in traffic 
fatalities following medical marijuana legalization. A study that used 1990–2010 Fatality 
Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data showed that, contrary to expectations, MML 
enactment was associated with a reduction in the rates of traffic fatalities in the overall 
population (10.4% reduction), mainly because of a reduction in alcohol-related traffic 
fatalities.9 These findings suggest that MML enactment could have contributed to an 
increase in marijuana use and lowered the use of alcohol, consistent with the substitution 
hypothesis,10 in these states, partially explaining the reduced alcohol-related incidents 
observed.
Previous research11 also shows that MMLs are heterogeneous across states, and that certain 
aspects of these laws, such as allowances on home cultivation or dispensaries, might be 
important to take into account when one is assessing the association between MMLs and 
different health outcomes. For example, a previous study showed that authorization of 
dispensaries in MML states was associated with treatment admissions in which marijuana is 
the primary substance of abuse.11 One study to date has found evidence of dispensary legal

 provisions in MML states to be associated with an increase in traffic fatalities,12 but the 
study did not examine the association between the actual presence of operational 
dispensaries (i.e., having an operating dispensary system even if not officially sanctioned) 
and traffic fatalities. Examining the role of operational dispensaries would provide additional 
information on whether increases in marijuana availability via dispensaries lead to changes 
in fatality rates.
We investigated the association between MML enactment and change in traffic fatalities, 
making use of a wider range of the FARS data, years 1985 to 2014, and including 9 
additional states enacting MMLs between 2010 and 2014. We examined whether the rate of 
traffic fatalities changed following MML enactment in 1985 to 2014, if the magnitude of the 
association differed by state, and if estimates were robust to different model specifications 
and to the inclusion of potential confounders in the model. In addition, we explored the 
specific role of operational medical marijuana dispensaries on traffic fatality rates.
METHODS
Data came from the FARS, a nationwide census of traffic fatalities information maintained 
by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Briefly, this data set provides data 
on individuals fatally injured in motor vehicle crashes on public roads in the United States 
who died within 30 days of the crash.13 Data include driver characteristics such as age, 
gender, and race. We obtained the aggregated FARS data from different sources including 
police accident reports, death certificates, coroner or medical examiner reports, hospital 
medical reports, state highway department data, emergency medical services records, vital 
statistics, and other state records.13 Trained analysts collected the data by using standardized 
protocols that automatically check for acceptable range values and consistency.13 We used 
FARS data from years 1985 to 2014, enabling us to include at least 10 years of pre-MML 
data for all states enacting these laws. We did not include the District of Columbia in the 
analyses.
Measures
Traffic fatalities—Our outcome of interest was the rate of traffic fatalities across time. We 
obtained the total number of fatally injured road users, including drivers, passengers, 
cyclists, and pedestrians, by year, state, and age group (entire population, and those aged 15–
24, 25–44, and ≥ 45 years) from FARS. We obtained state populations for each year, state, 
and age group used to calculate fatality rates for each state from the Web-based Injury 
Statistics Query and Reporting System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.14 
In analyses for the entire population, we used age-adjusted traffic fatality rates based on the 
2000 US population.
Enactment and effective date of medical marijuana laws—Our main exposure was 
the enactment of MMLs by state, as defined by legal scholars, economists, and policy 
analysts at RAND Corporation15 (Table A, available as a supplement to the online version of 
this article at http://www.ajph.org). First, we coded the MML variable as a time-varying (i.e., 
allowed to change over time), 3-category variable. The 3 categories were before, after, and 
never. States enacting medical marijuana laws were coded as “before” for the years before

 the enactment of the laws, and as “after” for years after. For example, because Vermont 
enacted its MML in 2004, this state is coded as “before” for years 1985 to 2003 and as 
“after” for years 2004 to 2014. As MMLs are enacted in different months, if the law was 
enacted between January 1 and June 30, we coded the year of MML enactment as “after,” 
because the state was exposed to the MML for at least half of the year in which it was 
enacted. Alternatively, if the MML was enacted between July 1 and December 31, we coded 
the year of MML enactment as “before,” because the state was exposed to the MML only for 
the second half of the year. States without MMLs up to 2014 were coded as “never” for all 
years.
We also used the date when MMLs became effective, when the statutory obligation 
commences in each state, rather than the date enacted. We used the same coding strategy as 
the one used for enactment dates.
Operational dispensaries—We coded the presence of operational dispensaries in MML 
states as a time-varying, 3-category variable in a similar way as we did for our MML 
variable—before, after, and never—on the basis of previous11,16 and recent information 
provided by researchers at RAND Corporation. States with MMLs were coded as “before” 
for years before they had operational dispensaries, and were coded as “after” for years when 
the state had legally operating dispensaries. This is when legislation was passed allowing 
marijuana sales and also an operational regulatory and distribution regime,16 or if the state 
had a functional dispensary system, even if not officially sanctioned16 (Table A). States 
without dispensaries were coded as “never” for all years.
Covariates—We adjusted our analyses for time-varying state characteristics and state 
legislation used in previous research.9 State-level covariates included unemployment rate 
and median household income, speed limits of 70 miles per hour or greater,17 primary seat 
belt laws enforcement, laws decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, 
and whether states had enacted a recreational marijuana law.18,19 The later 4 covariates were 
coded as “1” if the state had the law in any given year and “0” otherwise. We also controlled 
for state-level graduated driver license laws,20 blood alcohol content laws (0.08 g/dL), drug 
per se laws,21 administrative license revocation laws,22 and laws banning cell phone use and 
texting while driving, separately targeting adolescents and adults.23 These later 5 covariates 
were coded as “1” if the state had the law in any given year and “0” otherwise; also, if the 
enactment of the law occurred during a calendar year, we coded that year as the proportion 
of the year the law was in effect. In addition, we included a measure of state annual 
expenditures for highway law enforcement and safety per capita (adjusted to 2000 dollars), 
and also a state measure of the annual vehicle miles driven per licensed driver (thousands of 
miles) from Highway Statistics, US Department of Transportation (both covariates log 
transformed).
Because alcohol consumption can be a confounder of the association between MML and 
traffic fatalities, we also explored the robustness of estimates when we controlled for a 
measure of the state-level per capita ethanol sales, total ethanol of all beverages combined 
per population aged 21 years or older (log transformed) from the Surveillance Reports of the 
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Results are presented in Table B,

However, because changes in ethanol sales could be a mechanism through which MML 
influences traffic fatalities, all results provided, except when indicated, are from models not 
including this covariate.
Statistical Analyses
To examine whether MMLs were associated with changes in the natural logarithm of the rate 
of traffic fatalities, we used linear multilevel regression models24 with state-level random 
intercepts. This main effect model, which used the 3-category MML as the exposure 
variable, allowed us to determine the change in the rate of fatalities within states before and 
after MML enactment (Figure 1: overall change, model 1) while taking into account the 
rates in states that did not enact MMLs. In addition, we used a piecewise cubic spline25 with 
a knot at 2007 to control for the nonlinearity of national trends in traffic fatality rates; this 
allowed us to control for any national events that could have influenced traffic fatality rates 
across states over time. All models were stratified by age group, weighted by the state 
population, and adjusted for covariates. The percent change in fatality rates associated with 
the enactment of MMLs was estimated with the equation,
(1)
To estimate the yearly variation in the rates of traffic fatalities after the enactment of MMLs, 
we used an alternative model strategy by including linear trends for years before and after 
the enactment of MML for states with these laws.26 In this “hybrid” model, the estimate for 
the 3-category MML variable represents the “immediate” change in the rate soon after 
MMLs are enacted, and the “trend” effect represents the change in the linear trend, from the 
pre-MML to the post-MML period26 (Figure 1). The hybrid model can be useful to identify 
a change in the trend in cases such as the one presented in Figure 1, when a marked 
decreasing trend in traffic fatalities in the pre-MML period is followed by an immediate 
reduction and then by a gradual increasing trend in traffic fatalities in the post-MML period. 
In this scenario, the main effect model would show an overall reduction in traffic fatalities 
associated with MML despite the change in the trend. The pattern in Figure 1 could emerge 
if, for example, the enactment of MML is followed by stronger police enforcement soon 
after the enactment that would result in an immediate reduction in traffic fatality rates; 
however, a possible gradual increase in the prevalence of marijuana use after enactment of 
MMLs could result in a gradually increasing prevalence of driving while intoxicated, leading 
to a gradual increase in traffic fatalities.
We also examined the association between operational dispensaries and traffic fatalities by 
using similar models as described previously adjusted by covariates and also by the time-
variant MML variable indicating whether states had or had not enacted MMLs.
Finally, we examined the state-specific association between MMLs and traffic fatalities in 
the entire population (i.e., all ages) by including state as a fixed effect in models, both in the 
main effect and hybrid models, with interaction terms (1) between MML and states, and (2) 
between pre–post-MML trends and states; in this model we dichotomized the MML variable

 as “1” in years in which states had a MML, and “0” otherwise. This provided us the before–
after comparison and the change in trends separately for each state that passed MMLs. We 
performed statistical analysis with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
A total of 1 220 610 deaths attributable to traffic crashes occurred in the 50 states during the 
study period (1985–2014). We observed a reduction in the age-adjusted (2000 US 
population) national rate of traffic fatalities from 1985 (17.8 per 100 000) to 2014 (10.0 per 
100 000). Although, on average, states enacting MMLs had lower rates of traffic fatalities 
compared with states without MMLs (26.3% lower; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 13.9%, 
36.9%) states with and without MMLs followed a similar trend pattern toward reductions in 
traffic fatality rates (Figure 2). Among individuals aged 24 to 44 years, the trend for states 
enacting MMLs before 2001 slightly deviated during 1996 to 2000, the period in which 
these states enacted their MMLs, from that of states enacting MMLs after 2001.
Medical Marijuana Law Enactment and Traffic Fatality Rates
Results from main effect models for the entire population (i.e., all ages) showed that, among 
states passing MMLs, the mean traffic fatality rate in the pre-MML period (12.1 per 100 
000) was significantly higher than that in the post-MML period (11.2 per 100 000), 
indicating a reduction of 10.8% (95% CI = 9.0%, 12.5%; % reduction = [1 − exp(−0.114] · 
100) in traffic fatality rates (Table 1). Similarly, we observed a reduction of 11.0% (95% CI 
= 8.5%, 13.5%), 12.0% (95% CI = 9.5%, 14.3%), and 9.0% (95% CI = 6.9%, 11.0%) among 
those aged 15 to 24 years, 25 to 44 years, and 45 years and older, respectively (Table 1).
In hybrid models for the entire population, the immediate effect (i.e., sudden change in 
fatality rate after MML enactment), indicated that there was an immediate reduction of 3.5% 
(95% CI = 1.1%, 5.8%), whereas the gradual effect (i.e., change in rate trend after MML 
enactment) was not significant (Table 1). For those aged 15 to 24 and 25 to 44 years, there 
were also similar immediate reductions in traffic fatalities as those observed in the entire 
population. Among those aged 25 to 44 years, the gradual effect was also negative and 
significant (difference in pre–post MML trends = −0.005; P < .01). We observed no 
significant reductions among those aged 45 years or older in hybrid models (Table 1).
Operational Dispensaries and Traffic Fatality Rates
Results from main effect models showed that dispensaries were associated with a significant 
reduction in traffic fatalities in those aged 25 to 44 years (5.1%; 95% CI = 1.5%, 8.6%), and 
a nonsignificant reduction in the entire population (2.7%; 95% CI = −0.01%, 5.3%; Table 1). 
In hybrid models, the immediate effect and gradual effects were not significant for any of the 
age groups (Table 1).
In the main effect models, further control for the state-level per-capita ethanol sales (log 
transformed) covariate reduced the magnitude of the association between MMLs and traffic 
fatalities by 20% to 22% across age groups, although estimates remained significant at a 
95% confidence level (Table B). Hybrid models were not impacted by the inclusion of this 
ethanol sales covariate.

 Results for the association between “MML effective date” variable and traffic fatality rates 
were almost identical to those described previously for the “MML enactment date” variable 
(Table C, available as a supplement to the online version of this article at http://
www.ajph.org).
Estimates for Individual States
Results from the main effect model show that in 7 states (California, Oregon, Washington, 
Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona) the MML enactment was significantly 
associated with a reduction in traffic fatality rates, whereas in 2 states (Rhode Island and 
Connecticut) MMLs were associated with an increase in rates (Table 2).
In hybrid models, only 4 states showed significant associations: California showed an 
immediate post-MML reduction of 16.0% in traffic fatalities (95% CI = 12.0%, 20.0%) 
followed by a gradual yearly increase (difference in pre–post-MML trends = 0.013; P < .01); 
similarly, New Mexico had an immediate post-MML reduction of 17.5% (95% CI = 1.4%, 
31.0%) and significant post-MML gradual increase in traffic fatalities (difference in pre–
post-MML trends=0.049; P < .01); Colorado had a nonsignificant immediate increase and a 
yearly significant reduction in fatality rates (difference in pre–post-MML trends = −0.022; P 
< .05); and Michigan had a positive immediate increase of 14.2% in traffic fatalities (95% CI 
= 4.7%, 24.5%) and a nonsignificant trend effect (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Using population-based data from 1985 to 2014, we found that, first, states that enacted 
MMLs during the study period had lower fatality rates compared with states without MMLs. 
Second, on average, traffic fatalities further decreased in states post-MML, with both 
immediate (sudden change in fatality rate after MML enactment) and gradual (change in rate 
trend after MML enactment) declines over time in those aged 25 to 44 years. Third, the 
association between MML and traffic fatalities varied considerably across states. Fourth, the 
presence of operational dispensaries was also associated with reductions in traffic fatalities 
in those aged 25 to 44 years.
We found that, on average during the study period, MML states had lower traffic fatality 
rates than non-MML states. It is possible that this is related to lower levels of alcohol-
impaired driving behavior in MML states. Evidence from the Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance Systems data from 200027 and 201228 shows that states that have enacted 
MMLs, compared with non-MML states, had, on average, lower proportions or rates of 
drivers endorsing having driven after having too much to drink. In addition, other 
unmeasured characteristics, including strength of public health laws related to driving, 
infrastructure characteristics (e.g., high-technology roads), or quality of health care systems, 
may partially explain these findings.
Our study also shows that, on average, MMLs were associated with an overall reduction in 
traffic fatalities in main effect models. In addition, in hybrid models, we found immediate 
and gradual reductions only among those aged 25 to 44 years, a group representing a great 
percentage of all registered patients for medical marijuana use,29 and a group showing

 increases in the prevalence of marijuana use in association with the enactment of MMLs.30 
Interestingly, we did not find strong evidence suggesting reductions among those aged 45 
years and older, which is also a group overrepresented in the population of patients 
registered in state medical marijuana programs.29 This suggests that the mechanisms by 
which MMLs reduce traffic fatalities mostly operate in those younger adults, a group also 
frequently involved in alcohol-related traffic fatalities; in 2004 and 2013, 47% of fatally 
injured drivers with a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or greater were aged 25 to 44 years.31
There may be different mechanisms by which MMLs may reduce traffic fatalities. Some 
evidence suggests9 that MMLs may increase marijuana use in the population and, consistent 
with the substitution hypothesis,10 reduce the prevalence of alcohol consumption that, in 
turn, would result in lower rates of alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Anderson et al.9 found 
reductions in traffic fatalities in which at least 1 driver was positive for any alcohol in the 
blood (marginally, P < .1) and those with blood alcohol concentrations greater than or equal 
to 0.1 grams per deciliter (P < .05), and also reductions in traffic fatality rates occurring on 
weekends, which are more likely to be alcohol-related than those on weekdays.
If MMLs reduce traffic fatalities by reducing alcohol-related deaths, it is expected that these 
reductions would have been gradual given that MMLs are likely to gradually increase the 
availability of marijuana as dispensaries are opened and the number of patients getting 
access to medical marijuana increases, for example, as described for patient registries across 
MML states.29 However, immediate reductions may also occur if the enactment of MMLs 
produces rapid changes in attitudes toward marijuana use in the overall population, reducing 
perceptions of risk associated with marijuana use. In addition, immediate reductions can be 
the result of stronger preventive police enforcement actions targeting weekend drivers 
occurring soon after the enactment of MMLs. In this regard, because few registered patients 
for medical marijuana are aged 15 to 24 years29 and also because MMLs had not been found 
to be associated with marijuana use in individuals aged 25 years or younger30 nor in 
adolescents,32,33 it is possible that the immediate reduction we observed in the hybrid model 
for those aged 15 to 24 years is related to external control measures, such as stronger police 
enforcement actions.
Our findings for specific state associations suggest that not all MML states experienced 
reductions in traffic fatality rates, but few actually experienced increases. Although results 
from main effects models suggest beneficial reductions in traffic fatalities for 7 states, in the 
hybrid model, only Colorado showed a significant yearly reduction in traffic fatalities. In 
California and New Mexico, after an initial immediate reduction, MMLs were actually 
associated with gradual increases in fatality rates. These findings provide evidence of the 
heterogeneity of MML–traffic fatalities associations across states and indicate the need for 
further research on the particularities of MML implementation at the local level and the 
interaction of MMLs with other aspects that may influence traffic fatality rates.
Finally, results from our operational dispensaries analyses, at least from the main effect 
model, support the initial findings that MMLs were associated with reductions in traffic 
fatalities among those aged 25 to 44 years and suggest that this may in part occur via 
increases in marijuana availability.

 Limitations
Limitations are noted. First, we described an overall association between MMLs and traffic 
fatalities, but we are uncertain of what the causal chain may be. This study adds to evidence 
of the association between MMLs and traffic fatalities, laying the groundwork for future 
studies on specific mechanisms. Moreover, our data suggest that one mechanism is through 
increases in marijuana availability as dispensaries become operational. Second, because we 
used state-level aggregate data, we could not observe whether associations vary across 
different cities or counties. However, our study provides state-level estimates, the level at 
which MMLs are enacted. Further research at local levels will improve our understanding of 
how MML aspects and also other factors relate to traffic fatalities.
Third, we did not examine other variations in medical marijuana laws (e.g., home 
cultivation, approved illnesses) in our models that could also have an effect on traffic 
fatalities. However, we examined the additional effect of operational dispensaries, an 
important factor increasing the availability of marijuana. Fourth, for states enacting MMLs 
after 2010, we had only short post-MML periods, which limited the identification of long-
term effects in these states.
Fifth, we could not examine whether MMLs were associated with increments in the rates of 
traffic fatalities in which drivers tested positive for the presence of cannabis metabolites in 
blood. Testing procedures vary by state and our own exploration of FARS data showed that 
only a limited number of states tested 80% or more of their fatally injured drivers. In 
addition, the FARS coding system does not differentiate between active and inactive 
cannabinoid metabolites34 and, therefore, it is not possible to know whether the driver was 
driving under the influence of marijuana. Sixth, we used data on traffic fatalities, the most 
extreme injury outcome; therefore, we cannot make any observations on the association 
between MMLs and nonfatal traffic injuries.
Finally, our measure of per-capita alcohol consumption may not fully capture varying 
alcohol consumption patterns in the population, and is not informative about specific age 
groups. However, per-capita alcohol consumption data have moderate to strong correlations 
with survey measures of drinking, heavy drinking, and binge drinking,35 and this indicator 
of overall alcohol consumption in the United States has been a long-term National Institutes 
of Health indicator of time trends in drinking.
Implications
Our study suggests that, on average, MMLs are associated with reductions in traffic 
fatalities, particularly pronounced among those aged 25 to 44 years, a group representing a 
great percentage of all registered patients for medical marijuana use,29 and with increased 
prevalence of marijuana use after the enactment of MMLs.30 Although increases in 
marijuana use following the establishment of marijuana dispensaries could reduce the 
occurrence of alcohol-related mortality by reducing the number of drivers driving under the 
influence of alcohol, other simultaneous factors at the state and local levels also may be 
responsible for these changes in traffic fatalities. Our findings show great heterogeneity of 
the MML–traffic fatalities associations across states, suggesting the presence of these other

 mechanisms. This is important for policy development and for the debate of the enactment 
or repealing of MMLs, given that alternative local strategies such as stronger police 
enforcement and programs aiming to reduce impaired driving involving any substance use 
could be local factors linked to reductions in traffic fatalities in MML states.
