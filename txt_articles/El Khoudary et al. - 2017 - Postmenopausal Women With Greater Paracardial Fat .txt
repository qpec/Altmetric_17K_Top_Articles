Background-—Volumes of paracardial adipose tissue (PAT) and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) are greater after menopause.
Interestingly, PAT but not EAT is associated with estradiol decline, suggesting a potential role of menopause in PAT accumulation.
We assessed whether volumes of heart fat depot (EAT and PAT) were associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in women
at midlife and whether these associations were modified by menopausal status and estradiol levels.
Methods and Results-—EAT and PAT volumes and CAC were measured using electron beam computed tomography scans. CAC was
evaluated as (1) the presence of CAC (CAC Agatston score ≥10) and (2) the extent of any CAC (log CAC Agatston score >0). The study
included 478 women aged 50.9 years (58% pre- or early perimenopausal, 10% late perimenopausal, and 32% postmenopausal). EAT
was significantly associated with CAC measures, and these associations were not modified by menopausal status or estradiol. In
contrast, associations between PAT and CAC measures were modified by menopausal status (interaction-P≤0.01). Independent of
study covariates including other adiposity measures, each 1-SD unit increase in log PAT was associated with 102% higher risk of CAC
presence (P=0.04) and an 80% increase in CAC extent (P=0.008) in postmenopausal women compared with pre- or early
perimenopausal women. Additional adjustment for estradiol and hormone therapy attenuated these differences. Moreover, the
association between PAT and CAC extent was stronger in women with lower estradiol levels (interaction P=0.004).
Conclusions-—The findings suggest that PAT is a potential menopause-specific coronary artery disease risk marker, supporting the
need to monitor and target this fat depot for intervention in women at midlife. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e004545. DOI: 10.

he incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is
the leading cause of death in women, increases after
menopause.1,2 As women transition though menopause, they
are undergo adverse alterations in body fat composition,3–7
lipids, and lipoproteins8 and vascular remodeling9 that could
increase their CAD risk. The menopausal transition, indepen-
dent of aging, is believed to be associated with changes in
body fat deposition rather than increases in weight.3–7,10,11
The fat surrounding the heart (heart fat) is hypothesized to be
more detrimental for cardiovascular risk than other fat depots
because of its close anatomic location.12 Increasing evidence
supports a role of heart fat in the pathogenesis of CAD,13,14
cardiovascular disease (CVD) events,15–17 and all-cause
mortality.18 Based on fat location in the pericardium, 2
distinct heart fat depots can be quantified: (1) epicardial

 heart
and
is located
between the outer wall
of
the
myocardium and the visceral layer of the pericardium, and
(2) paracardial adipose tissue (PAT), which is located anterior
to EAT, outside the parietal layer of the pericardium.19
Although EAT and PAT have different anatomic locations and
endocrine features, the terms EAT and PAT have been used
interchangeably in the literature because they were thought to
be identical fat depots. We recently showed that post-
menopausal women have greater volumes of EAT and PAT
than premenopausal women, independent of age, race,
obesity, and other potential risk factors.20 Interestingly,
greater volumes of PAT, but not EAT, were significantly
associated with lower levels and declines of estradiol (E2) in
women at midlife,20 suggesting a potential role of menopause
and menopause-related alterations in sex hormones in PAT
accumulation. In addition, these findings support the notions
that EAT and PAT depots have distinct endocrine features and
should not be evaluated as a single fat depot.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has
evaluated whether heart fat depots (EAT and PAT separately)
are significantly associated with greater risk of subclinical CVD
in women at different stages of the menopausal transition or
assessed the effect modification of menopausal status and/or
endogenous E2 levels on associations between heart fat depots
and subclinical CVD. Previous studies were mainly limited to
postmenopausal women.21,22 Premenopausal women were not
included for comparisons in any of these studies; therefore,
determining whether PAT or EAT might be a menopause-
specific CAD risk marker could not be evaluated in any of the
previous studies. The SWAN Cardiovascular Fat Ancillary Study,
an ancillary study to the Study of Women’s Health Across the
Nation (SWAN), was specifically designed (1) to assess the
distinct associations between each heart fat depot and
coronary artery calcification (CAC)—a robust subclinical mea-
sure of CAD23,24—in midlife women and (2) to investigate
whether the associations between heart fat depots and CAC are
modified by menopausal status and/or endogenous levels of
E2. Given our recent findings showing greater volumes of EAT
and PAT in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women and
that levels of endogenous E2 could be an important contributor
to PAT but not to EAT volumes,20 we hypothesized that greater
volumes of EAT and PAT would be significantly associated with
CAC and that the association between PAT and CAC, but not
between EAT and CAC, would be significantly modified by
menopausal status and E2 levels in women at midlife.
Participants and Methods
Study Population
SWAN is an ongoing longitudinal community-based study of
the menopausal transition.25 Briefly, 3302 participants aged
42 to 52 years were recruited during the period 1996–1997
from 7 study sites (Boston, MA; Detroit, MI; Oakland, CA; Los
Angeles, CA; Pittsburgh, PA; Chicago, IL; and Newark, NJ). The
eligibility criteria for the SWAN study were (1) an intact uterus
and ≥1 ovary, (2) ≥1 menstrual period within the past
3 months, and (3) no hormone therapy (HT) use within the
past 3 months. At the Pittsburgh and Chicago sites, subclin-
ical measures of atherosclerosis were collected as part of the
SWAN Heart ancillary study. The SWAN Cardiovascular Fat
Ancillary Study was designed to measure cardiovascular fat
volumes among SWAN Heart study participants. To be part of
the SWAN Cardiovascular Fat Ancillary Study, participants had
to have electron beam computed tomography scans per-
formed at the SWAN Heart baseline visit. Of 608 SWAN Heart
participants, 564 had electron beam computed tomography
scans to measure heart fat depots. For the current analyses,
women were excluded if they were surgically menopausal, had
undetermined menopausal status due to HT use, or were
missing information on menopausal status (n=42). Another 44
women were excluded either because of missing CAC data or
inability to quantify heart fat depots because of technical
issues, leaving 478 women in final analyses.
The institutional review board at each site approved the
study protocol, and all participants signed informed consent
prior to participation.
Coronary Artery Calcification
Calcification in the coronary arteries was quantified using the
C-150 Ultrafast CT Scanner (GE Imatron). An initial scout scan
was performed to identify anatomic landmarks. To evaluate
the coronary arteries, 30 to 40 contiguous 3-mm-thick
transverse images were obtained from the level of the aortic
root to the apex of the heart during maximal breath holding.
All scan data were saved to an optical disk for central scoring,
using a DICOM workstation and software by Accu-Image, Inc.
This software program implements the Agatston scoring
method.26 CAC was defined as a hyperattenuating lesion
>130 Hounsfield units, with an area of at least 3 pixels. The
total calcification score was the sum of the individual scores
for the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries. The scoring
system had high reproducibility as measured in 40 consec-
utive participants from another study selected to have a wide
range of calcium. The intraclass correlation for CAC scores
was 0.99.27
Heart Fat Depots
Electron beam computed tomography scans (GE Imatron
C-150 Ultrafast CT Scanner) were used to quantify EAT, the
adipose tissue within the pericardium, and PAT, the adipose
tissue outside the pericardium. EAT and PAT were quantified

 at the Biomedical Research Institute, Harbor- UCLA Medical
Center, as described previously.20 In brief, total heart fat
volume (EAT plus PAT) was determined from 15 mm above to
30 mm below the superior extent of the left main coronary
artery. This region of the heart was selected because it
includes the epicardial fat surrounding the proximal coronary
arteries. The anterior border of the heart fat volume was the
chest wall, and the posterior borders were the aorta and the
bronchus. Using the volume analysis software (GE Health-
care), fat was distinguished from other heart tissue by a
threshold of �190 to �30 Hounsfield units. EAT was
measured by manually tracing out the pericardium every 2
to 3 slices below the start point and then using the software
to automatically trace out the segments in between these
selected slices. PAT was measured by subtracting EAT volume
from total heart fat volume. Reproducibility measurements of
EAT and PAT were performed on 20 randomly selected scans
from another study that used a similar protocol.21 Both
Spearman and intraclass correlation coefficients between
readers (intrareader) were 0.99 each for EAT and 0.86 and
0.96, respectively, for PAT. Similarly, both Spearman and
intraclass correlation coefficients between repeated readings
(interreader) were 0.98 each for EAT and 0.96 and 0.90,
respectively, for PAT.21
Menopausal Status
Menopausal status was determined based on frequency and
regularity
of
menstrual
bleeding
as
follows:
(1)
pre-
menopause, no perceived change in bleeding; (2) early
perimenopause, perceived change in cycle interval but at
least 1 menstrual period within the past 3 months; (3) late
perimenopause, 3 consecutive months of amenorrhea; (4)
postmenopause, 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea.
Because the sample size of premenopausal women was
small (n=49) and their characteristics and E2 and CAC levels
were similar to those of early perimenopausal women (data
not shown), pre- and early perimenopausal women were
combined in 1 group in the current study. In contrast, only
50 women were classified as late perimenopausal; however,
we did not combine those women with postmenopausal
women, as we have done previously,20 given that the 2
groups had different CAC levels. Late peri- and post-
menopausal women were analyzed as separate groups in
the current study.
Blood Assays
Women provided fasting blood samples during the early
follicular phase (days 2–5 of the menstrual cycle) at each visit.
Fasting samples were obtained within 90 days of the
recruitment anniversary date if a timed sample could not be
obtained. Accordingly, cycle day of blood draw was reported
either as days 2 to 5 or as being outside that period. Blood
was prepared and serum shipped to the Clinical Ligand Assay
Satellite Services Central Laboratory at the University of
Michigan. E2 was measured using a modified, off-line
Automated Chemiluminescence System 180 (E2-6). E2 assays
were conducted in duplicate. The average for the duplicate
measures was calculated and reported (coefficients of
variation of 3–12%). The lower limit of detection was between
1 and 7 pg/mL. The inter- and intra-assay coefficients of
variation were 10.6% and 6.4%, respectively. E2 values
between zero and the lower limit of detection were replaced
with a random value between zero and the lower limit of
detection.
Lipids, glucose, and insulin were assayed at the Medical
Research Laboratories in Lexington, Kentucky, certified by the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention Part III program. Total cholesterol and
triglyceride levels were analyzed using enzymatic methods on
a Hitachi 747 analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics),28
and high-density lipoprotein was isolated using heparin–
manganese.29 Low-density lipoprotein was calculated using
the Friedewald equation.30 Serum insulin was measured by a
radioimmunoassay (Coat-a-Count; Diagnostic Products Corp)
procedure and monitored as part of the monthly quality
assurance program by the Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory at
the University of Missouri. Glucose was measured with a
hexokinase-coupled reaction (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnos-
tics). The homeostasis model assessment index was calcu-
lated from fasting insulin and glucose as follows: (insulin [in
uIU/ml]9glucose [in mmol/L])/22.5.31,32
Study Covariates
Weight and height were measured to calculate body mass
index (BMI; kg/m2). Blood pressure was averaged from 2
sequential measures in the right arm with the participant
seated after at least 5 minutes of rest. Race and ethnicity,
age, smoking status, use of HT, and educational level were
self-reported. Physical activity was self-reported and was
assessed via a modified Baecke score of habitual physical
activity,33 with higher scores indicating more physical activity.
Morbidity was defined as yes if participant reported a history
of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, angina, stroke, or heart
attack. Medication use was defined as yes if the participant
reported use of medications for hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, or high cholesterol. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT)
area was measured using 6-mm-thick transverse electron
beam computed tomography scan (C-150 Ultrafast CT
Scanner; GE Imatron) between L4 and L5 obtained during
suspended respiration. Computed tomography scans were
read by a single individual at the University of Pittsburgh. A

 pixel range of �30 to �190 Hounsfield units was used to
define fat in the scan circumference. VAT area was defined
using image analysis (Accu-Image software). A region-of-
interest line was drawn at the interior of abdominal muscu-
lature along the fascial plane. Fat within this area was
considered VAT area. Intraobserver reliability was 0.94 for the
VAT area.
Statistical Analyses
Heart fat volumes, E2, triglycerides, and homeostasis model
assessment index were log transformed to reduce skewed
distributions. CAC was evaluated at 2 different levels: (1) by
the presence of CAC (CAC Agatston score ≥10) and (2) by
the extent of any CAC (log CAC Agatston score >0). Study
variables were compared by the presence of CAC and by
menopausal status (data not shown) using ANOVA, t tests, or
chi-square tests, as appropriate. Separate logistic regression
(for presence of CAC) and linear regression (for extent of
CAC) models were developed to evaluate the associations
between each CAC measure as an outcome, with each log-
transformed heart fat depot volume as the main independent
variable. Results from logistic and linear regression were
presented per 1-SD increase in each log heart fat depot
volume. For ease of interpretation, beta coefficients from
linear regression models of log heart fat depots as related to
log CAC >0 (CAC extent) were presented as percentage
changes and 95% CI in CAC extent. For multivariable
analyses, age, race, study site, and menopausal status were
a priori selected covariates and were forced into the base
model regardless of statistical significance. All other variables
that were found to be significantly associated with study
outcomes (Table 1) and independent variables in the univari-
ate analyses (data not shown) were considered as potential
covariates to be adjusted for in model 2. To build the best
parsimonious model 2, step-up regression was used. Models
with the best fit statistics (highest C or R2 statistics) were
chosen. Because of the high correlations between adiposity
measures (BMI, VAT) and heart fat depots (EAT, PAT), we
could not adjust for both BMI and VAT in the same model.
Models adjusted for BMI fit the data better than models
adjusted for VAT; however, for some models, adjusting for
BMI resulted in significant associations in the direction
opposite what we expected, which is a sign of collinearity.
Adjusting for obesity (BMI ≥30) instead did not severely
affect model stability, and thus final models were adjusted for
obesity instead of BMI. Model 3 was additionally adjusted for
log E2, HT use, and cycle day of the blood draw (days 2–5
versus outside that period) to assess the impact of endoge-
nous E2 and exogenous HT use on the tested associations.
Effect modifications by menopausal status or by log E2 were
tested, and stratified analyses were presented if interactions
were significant. For significant interactions between contin-
uous measures of log E2 and PAT volumes as related to CAC,
interactions were retested using tertiles of both E2 and PAT
for easier interpretation. Statistical tests were 2-sided with a
significance level of 0.05. SAS software (version 9.3; SAS
Institute Inc) was used for the analysis.
Results
Participants’ characteristics in the total sample and by
presence of CAC are presented in Table 1. Participants
were aged 50.9�2.9 years and were 38% black; 58% were
pre-
or
early
perimenopausal,
10%
were
late
peri-
menopause, and 32% were postmenopausal. Participants
with
CAC
≥10
were
more
likely
to
be
older,
post-
menopausal, and obese and to have higher systolic blood
pressure,
BMI,
VAT,
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol,
triglycerides, and homeostasis model assessment index
and lower physical activity score and high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol, and E2 levels. In addition, those partici-
pants were more likely to report comorbid conditions and
use of medications (all P<0.05).
Associations between heart fat depots and presence of
CAC and extent of CAC are presented in Table 2. In base
models (model 1) adjusted for age, race, study site, and
menopausal status, both EAT and PAT were significantly
associated with greater odds of CAC presence and greater
extent of log (CAC >0). Further adjustments for obesity,
systolic blood pressure, smoking status, log triglycerides, and
medication use explained the associations with PAT but not
with EAT. Additional adjustment for log E2, HT use, and cycle
day of the blood draw did not affect the associations between
EAT and CAC measures. In contrast, the magnitude of the
associations between PAT and CAC increased and the
reported P values decreased when models were additionally
adjusted for log E2 and HT use.
Significant interactions were found between PAT and
menopausal status as related to presence (Table 3) and
extent (Table 4) of CAC. Interestingly, the odds of CAC
presence per 1-SD unit increase in log PAT were 102% higher
in postmenopausal women compared with pre- or early
perimenopausal women, independent of study covariates
(model 2) but not independent of endogenous E2 levels and
HT use (model 3). Additional adjustment for these 2
covariates explained the difference in risk of CAC presence
between the 2 groups (Table 3). Similarly, postmenopausal
women showed an 80% increase in CAC extent compared with
pre- or early perimenopausal women per 1-SD unit increase in
log PAT in model 2 (Table 4). These differences were
attenuated after additional adjustment for endogenous E2
levels and HT use (model 3) (Table 4). Stratified analyses by

 menopausal status showed stronger associations and larger
effect sizes in the relationships of PAT with presence of CAC
(Table 5) and the extent of CAC (Table 6) in postmenopausal
women than in pre- or early perimenopausal women. Adjust-
ing for VAT instead of obesity in model 2 in Tables 3 through
6 provided similar findings (data not shown).
Association between PAT and CAC extent was dependent
on E2 levels, adjusting for study site, age, race and ethnicity,
menopausal status, obesity, systolic blood pressure, smoking,
log triglycerides, medication use, cycle day of the blood draw,
and HT use (interaction P=0.004). Similar results were seen if
the model was adjusted for VAT instead of obesity (data not
shown). Higher volumes of PAT were significantly associated
with greater CAC extent only among women with E2 levels in
the lowest tertile (E2 ≤18.65 pg/mL; trend P=0.038) (Fig-
ure 1).
Associations between EAT and CAC measures were not
significantly modified by menopausal status. In addition, E2
levels did not significantly modify these associations, except
for a weak interaction between E2 and EAT related to extent
of calcification (P=0.04) that became nonsignificant once
models were adjusted for VAT instead of obesity.

 Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to assess
associations between volumes of heart fat depots and CAC in
women at different stages of the menopausal transition and to
evaluate the impact of menopausal status and endogenous E2
levels on these associations. We demonstrated that greater
volumes of EAT are significantly associated with presence and
extent of CAC, independent of age, race, menopausal status,
and traditional CVD risk factors. In addition, we reported that
the associations between PAT and CAC measures are
significantly modified by women’s menopausal status and
E2 levels independent of age, race, obesity (or VAT; data not
shown), and other CVD risk factors; similar effect modifica-
tions were not found for EAT as related to CAC measures.
Our findings of significant associations of CAC measures
with EAT volumes in women at midlife are in agreement with
previous studies in other populations, which suggests a
significant role of EAT in the pathogenesis of CAD. Higher
heart fat volumes are associated with CVD risk factors, CVD
events, and CAC.13–18 It is well recognized that heart fat is a
metabolically active organ that releases various substances
with known vascular actions that, in turn, could locally
modulate the morphology and functions of the heart and thus

We demonstrated that the associations between CAC
measures and EAT do not depend on women’s menopausal
status or E2 levels, whereas the associations between CAC
measures and PAT were menopause-specific and may be

 modulated by women’s endogenous levels of E2. In our
previous work, although late peri- and postmenopausal
women had greater volumes of EAT and PAT than pre- and
early
perimenopausal
women,20
late
peri-
and
post-
menopausal women had greater volumes of PAT (20% higher)
than EAT (10% higher) compared with pre- and early
perimenopausal women. In addition, we reported that women
with the greatest E2 decline over almost 5 years of follow-up
had 20% higher PAT volumes compared with women with the
least decline in E2 over time.20 We hypothesized, based on
these previous findings, that heart fat could play a role in the
higher risk of CVD reported in women after menopause. In the
current study, we showed that postmenopausal women had
�80% greater CAC extent than pre- and early perimenopausal
women per 1 SD greater log PAT. The current results,
together with our noted previous findings,20 support our
hypothesis that PAT is a potential menopause-specific CAD
risk marker in women at midlife. Further research is needed to
confirm our hypothesis using a longitudinal study design.
Our findings of significant impact of E2 levels on associ-
ations of CAC with PAT but not with EAT add to the lines of
evidence that EAT and PAT are distinct heart fat depots with
different endocrine properties and thus should be evaluated
separately.12 EAT and PAT have different embryological
origins; EAT originates from the splanchnopleuric mesoderm,
whereas PAT originates from the primitive thoracic mes-
enchyme. Moreover, the coronary circulation supplies blood
to EAT but not to PAT. Finally, EAT is the energy source for the
heart, with high free fatty acid release and uptake and low
glucose requirements; in contrast, to date, there are no
known cardioprotective functions of PAT.34
It is not clear why E2 levels modulated the associations of
CAC with PAT but not EAT. We previously reported significant
associations between lower levels and greater declines of E2

 with PAT but not EAT.20 These findings support that volumes
of PAT but not EAT may be modulated by E2. Estrogen
receptor Er-a,35 expressed in human subcutaneous and
visceral adipose tissues,36 plays a significant role in regulating
adipocyte metabolism and sexual dimorphism of adipose
tissue depots. E2 can directly increase the antilipolytic a2A-
adrenergic receptors37 and lipolytic b-adrenergic expression38
to control the accumulation of fat in a certain adipose tissue
depot. Consequently, it is possible that Er-a estrogen
receptors are more expressed in PAT than in EAT and could,
in turn, make any changes in E2 levels affect PAT more than
EAT. It would be of great interest to assess the potential role
of HT use on heart fat volumes and their associations with
subclinical atherosclerotic measures such as CAC in future
studies.
In the current study, greater PAT volume was associated
with higher odds of CAC presence and greater CAC extent in
postmenopausal women compared with pre- and early
perimenopausal women. These findings were independent of
study covariates but not of endogenous E2 levels and HT use.
Given the current uncertainty about the cardioprotective
impacts of HT use39 and the lack of any publication on the
impact of HT use on heart fat volumes, identifying other
possible prevention strategies to decrease heart fat in general
and PAT in particular in women at midlife may reduce CVD
risk associated with excess heart fat. Interestingly, a recent

 systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing
whether heart fat volumes could be modified and whether
different strategies could be utilized concluded that it is
possible to reduce heart fat and that significant reductions
occurred with dieting and bariatric surgery but not with
exercise.40 Heart fat can be decreased by 17% in abdominally
obese postmenopausal women on weight-loss interventions
of equal energy deficit with or without aerobic exercise.41
Our findings should be viewed in the context of some
limitations, including the cross-sectional design, which pre-
vented us from testing whether the accumulation of heart fat
is associated with CAC progression and whether the dynamic
changes in E2 as women transition through menopause could
modify this association. Our findings may not be generalizable
to women of other ages or other racial and ethnic groups.
Because of small sample sizes for the pre- and late
perimenopausal categories, we may not have enough power
to assess study aims in each category separately. In addition,
our findings of the extent of CAC and PAT should be
interpreted with caution, given the wide reported confidence
intervals, which could be due to small sample size. This study
has several strengths, which include using a well-character-
ized cohort (SWAN) and being the first to evaluate whether
volumes of heart fat are associated with CAC in women at
midlife and whether women’s menopausal status and their E2
levels modify this association. Future studies should evaluate
the role of HT use on heart fat volume accumulation and the
impact of HT use on the associations between heart fat
volumes and subclinical measures of atherosclerosis.
In conclusion, although greater volumes of EAT were
significantly associated with CAC, only the association of CAC
with volumes of PAT was dependent on menopausal status
and E2 levels. Our findings suggest PAT as a potential
menopause-specific CAD risk marker and maintain that EAT
and PAT are distinct fat depots that should be evaluated
separately. The current study supports the need to monitor
and target heart fat depots for intervention in women at
midlife.
