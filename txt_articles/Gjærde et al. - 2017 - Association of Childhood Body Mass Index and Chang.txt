IMPORTANCE The incidence of ischemic stroke among young adults is rising and is potentially
due to an increase in stroke risk factors occurring at younger ages, such as obesity.
OBJECTIVES To investigate whether childhood body mass index (BMI) and change in BMI are
associated with adult ischemic stroke and to assess whether the associations are age
dependent or influenced by birth weight.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a population-based cohort study
of schoolchildren born from 1930 to 1987, with follow-up through national health registers
from 1977 to 2012 in Denmark. Participants were 307 677 individuals (8899 ischemic stroke
cases) with measured weight and height at ages 7 to 13 years. The dates of the analysis were
September 1, 2015, to May 27, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Childhood BMI, change in BMI, and birth weight. Ischemic
stroke events were divided into early (�55 years) or late (>55 years) age at diagnosis.
RESULTS The study cohort comprised 307 677 participants (approximately 49% female and
51% male). During the study period, 3529 women and 5370 men experienced an ischemic
stroke. At all ages from 7 to 13 years, an above-average BMI z score was positively associated
with early ischemic stroke. At age 13 years, a BMI z score of 1 was associated with hazard
ratios (HRs) of 1.26 (95% CI, 1.11-1.43) in women and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.10-1.33) in men. No
significant associations were found for below-average BMI z scores. Among children with
above-average BMI z scores at age 7 years, a score increase of 0.5 from ages 7 to 13 years was
positively associated with early ischemic stroke in women (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.20) and in
men (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.16). Similarly, among children with below-average BMI z scores
at age 7 years, a score increase of 0.5 from ages 7 to 13 years was positively associated with
early ischemic stroke in women (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.23) and in men (HR, 1.10; 95% CI,
1.04-1.18). Adjusting for birth weight minimally affected the associations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Independent of birth weight, above-average childhood BMI
and increases in BMI during childhood are positively associated with early adult ischemic
stroke. To avoid the occurrence of early ischemic stroke associated with childhood
overweight and obesity, these results suggest that all children should be helped to attain
and maintain healthy weights.

schemic stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide and
is a major cause of acquired disability and loss of produc-
tive life-years, especially in younger individuals.1,2 Women
areparticularlyaffectedbecauseatyoungagestheyhavepoorer
functional outcomes than men, and at older ages they have a
poorer prognosis.3,4 While declining incidence rates of over-
all stroke have been reported in many high-income countries,5
the incidence of ischemic stroke among young adults has in-
creased in some populations, including Denmark.6 This oc-
currence may be related to earlier exposure, even in child-
hood, to risk factors for ischemic stroke, such as hypertension,
type 2 diabetes, and obesity.1,7
Studies8-13 investigating the associations between child-
hood body mass index (BMI) and adult ischemic stroke have
shown inconsistent results. In 1 study,10 there were indica-
tionsofanonlinearassociationbetweenchildhoodobesityand
laterstroke,buttheotherstudiesdidnotinvestigatetheshapes
of the associations. Furthermore, only 2 studies8,9 distin-
guished between major stroke subtypes, only 1 study9 inves-
tigated the potential importance of birth weight, and another
sole study8 assessed the age at stroke occurrence.
Because the prevalence of childhood obesity is high in
many countries,14 it is important to clarify the association be-
tween childhood BMI and risk of adult ischemic stroke, espe-
cially at younger adult ages, to justify earlier targeted preven-
tion. We investigated if BMI in childhood and changes in BMI
during childhood are associated with the risk of first ische-
mic stroke in women and men. Furthermore, we assessed
whether the associations are dependent on the age at stroke
occurrence and birth weight.
Methods
Participants and Procedures
The study was based on data from the Copenhagen School
Health Records Register,15 which includes computerized in-
formationon372 636childrenbornfrom1930to1989andmea-
sured from 1936 to 2002, with follow-up through national
health registers from 1977 to 2012 in Denmark. The dates of
the analysis were September 1, 2015, to May 27, 2016. As part
of a school-based health care program, each child who at-
tended public or private schools in Copenhagen, Denmark, be-
fore1983underwentanannualexaminationandthereafterwas
examined at school entry and exit. Weight and height were
measured by trained school physicians and nurses through-
outtheentireperiod.Thisinformationwasrecordedonahealth
card along with the child’
s name, date of birth, identification
number, and birth weight, as reported by parents, for indi-
viduals born from 1936 onward. The analyses were con-
ducted on anonymous data, and the study was approved by
the Danish Data Protection Agency. According to Danish law,
informedconsentandethicalapprovalarenotrequiredforreg-
ister-based analyses.
We recorded BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared) and transformed it to a
BMI z score based on an internal age-specific and sex-
specific reference chosen from a period when the prevalence
of obesity was low and stable.16 We obtained information on
stroke events from the Danish National Cause of Death
Register,17 which has been computerized since 1970, and the
Danish National Hospital Register,18 which was established
in 1977; follow-up was initiated from 1977 onward. In both
registers, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
Eighth Revision before 1994 and 10th Revision thereafter was
used to classify ischemic stroke (ICD-8 codes 433-434 and
ICD-10 code I63) and unspecified stroke (ICD-8 code 436 and
ICD-10 code I64). Diagnoses of ischemic stroke were based
on imaging except for the few occurring before the 1990s
(522 cases [5.9%]), which were based on clinical assessment.
Vital status was obtained by linkage to the computerized
Danish Civil Registration System.19
We included women and men with a personal identifica-
tion number who were at least age 25 years at study entry (cor-
responding to birth years of 1930 to 1987) and had a mini-
mum of 1 measurement of both weight and height (eFigure 1
in the Supplement). Follow-up ended on the date of a first-
ever ischemic stroke diagnosis, the date of death from an-
other cause, loss to follow-up, emigration, or December 31,
2012, whichever occurred first.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted all analyses separately for women and men.4
We used Cox proportional hazards regression models, with
age as the underlying time axis, to estimate hazard ratios
(HRs)and95%CIsforischemicstrokeaccordingtoBMIzscores
at ages 7 to 13 years. Because the patterns of the associations
were similar at all ages, we present the results only for age 13
years (other ages are shown in eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the
Supplement).
Indications of nonlinear associations between childhood
BMI z scores and ischemic stroke were detected by testing
against a restricted cubic spline model using likelihood ratio
tests (P < .05 for deviations from linearity at each age from 7
to 13 years). Therefore, we present the results using a re-
stricted cubic spline based on 4 knot points of childhood BMI
z scores. We tested the proportional hazards assumptions by
includingatime-varyingeffectofBMIinthemodelandthrough
assessment using double cumulative hazard plots.20 Because
we found violations of proportional hazards indicating that the
Key Points
Question Is childhood body mass index and change in body mass
index associated with adult ischemic stroke?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of 307 677 Danish
individuals (8899 ischemic stroke cases), above-average body
mass indexes at ages 7 to 13 years and increases in body mass
index across these ages heightened the risk of ischemic stroke at
ages 25 to 55 years but not at older ages. The associations were
not influenced by birth weight.
Meaning To avoid early ischemic strokes associated with
childhood overweight and obesity from occurring, these results
suggest that, in addition to weight reduction and maintenance in
obese children, other individualized measures may be necessary.

 associations were different for women and men who experi-
enced an ischemic stroke at 55 years or younger vs after 55
years, we stratified the analyses by age. This stratification ful-
filled the assumptions of proportional hazards. All analyses
were stratified by birth cohort (1930-1934, 1935-1939, 1940-
1944, 1945-1949, 1950-1954, 1955-1959, 1960-1964, 1965-
1969,1970-1974,1975-1979,and1980-1987),allowingthebase-
line hazard to differ for each birth cohort. Moreover, we found
no consistent differences in the associations by birth cohort
when testing for potential interactions.
We also analyzed the associations using Cox proportional
hazards regressions by categories based on percentiles of the
BMI z score distributions as follows: less than fifth, fifth to less
than 25th, 25th to 75th (reference), greater than 75th to 95th,
and greater than 95th. We estimated population attributable
fractions using the US Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion classifications of overweight and obesity for 13-year-old
children to illustrate potential contributions of contempo-
rary levels of childhood overweight and obesity on early adult
ischemic stroke.21,22
WeexaminedtheassociationofchangeinBMI zscorefrom
ages 7 to 13 years with ischemic stroke by stratifying the analy-
ses by BMI because of the nonlinear associations for level of
BMI.Therefore,changeinBMIzscore,conditionedonthebase-
line BMI at age 7 years or the attained BMI at age 13 years (both
as continuous variables), was investigated among those with
a BMI below or above average (BMI z score ≤0 or >0) at ages 7
and 13 years. Likelihood ratio tests demonstrated no poten-
tialinteractionsbetweenchangeinBMIzscoreandeitherbase-
line or attained BMI (P > .05) within the 2 BMI strata.
Given the reported opposing associations of birth weight
and childhood BMI with ischemic stroke,23,24 we performed
an analysis in the subcohort with information on birth weight
(n = 237 501) to investigate the influence of birth weight, po-
tential interactions between birth weight and BMI, and the as-
sociation of adjusting for birth weight with ischemic stroke.
We used Cox proportional hazards regression models and the
likelihood ratio test to investigate potential interactions. All
analyses were stratified by birth cohort.
To estimate the HRs for ischemic stroke in the presence
of the likely competing risk of death, we conducted a subdis-
tribution hazard regressions model using the approach by Fine
and Gray.25 In a sensitivity analysis, a combined group of is-
chemic and unspecified strokes was examined as the out-
come because a Danish study26 showed that strokes coded as
unspecified are actually ischemic in approximately 60% of
cases, with the remainder being a combination of hemor-
rhagic stroke and other diagnoses.
Statistical significance was set at P < .05, and all tests were
2 sided. Analyses were performed using statistical software
(Stata, version 14.1; StataCorp LLC).
Results
Childhoodweightandheightmeasurementsatages7to13years
were available for 307 677 of the eligible individuals (eFigure 1
in the Supplement). The mean BMI and variation in BMI in-
creased with childhood age, as expected (Table 1). The chil-
dren were followed up from ages 25 through 82 years (median
follow-up, 26.4 years), corresponding to 8 128 058 person-
years of follow-up. During this period, 3529 women and 5370
menwerediagnosedashavingischemicstroke,ofwhich23.0%
and 23.4%, respectively, occurred at 55 years or younger. As ex-
pected,theincidencerateofischemicstrokeincreasedwithad-
vancing age in both sexes, with a higher rate in men until age
75 years, after which the rate rapidly increased in women
(Figure 1).
Although we found no significant associations between
BMI and risk of late adult ischemic stroke (age >55 years), there
was a nonlinear association of BMI at ages 7 to 13 years with
early-occurring (age ≤55 years) ischemic stroke in both sexes
(Figure 2 and eFigures 2 and 3 in the Supplement). Positive as-
sociations with early adult ischemic stroke were observed for
those with an above-average childhood BMI (BMI z score >0),
and no significant associations were observed for those with
a below-average childhood BMI (BMI z score ≤0). Women with

 a BMI z score of 1 at age 13 years had an HR of 1.26 (95% CI,
1.11-1.43) for early adult ischemic stroke, and the HR in-
creased with higher BMI z scores, reaching an HR of 1.76 (95%
CI, 1.38-2.25) in women who had a BMI z score of 2 (Figure 2).
In men, a BMI z score of 1 at age 13 years was associated with
an HR of 1.21 (95% CI, 1.10-1.33) for early adult ischemic stroke,
and a BMI z score of 2 was associated with an HR of 1.58 (95%
CI, 1.27-1.98). Put into perspective, moving from a BMI z score
of 0 to a BMI z score of 1 equates to an additional 6.8 kg in girls
and 5.9 kg in boys based on children with an average weight
and height (44.6 kg and 156.7 cm in girls and 42.5 kg and
159.9 cm in boys) in our population. Using the same compari-
son,movingfromaBMIzscoreof0toaBMIzscoreof2equates
to an additional 16.4 kg in girls and 14.8 kg in boys. The cat-
egorical analyses showed that, compared with the reference
category, having a BMI at age 13 years in the greater than 75th
to 95th and greater than 95th percentiles was associated with
early ischemic stroke. In women, the HRs were 1.24 (95% CI,
1.04-1.48) and 1.71 (95% CI, 1.30-2.26), respectively, and the
HRs in men were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.05-1.43) and 1.77 (95% CI, 1.39-
2.24), respectively (Table 2).
In250 437womenandmenwithBMImeasurementsavail-
able at ages 7 and 13 years, we examined the associations of
change in BMI z score with early and late adult ischemic stroke
(Table 2). Because we use an internal reference, the mean
changes in BMI z score between ages 7 and 13 years were 0.11
in girls and 0.05 in boys (Table 1). Among women, an increase
in BMI z score between ages 7 and 13 years was associated with
early adult ischemic stroke, regardless of baseline or attained
BMI (Table 3). Similar associations were seen among men with
a BMI z score greater than 0, but the associations between
change in BMI z score and early adult ischemic stroke disap-
peared when adjusting for BMI at age 13 years.
We found inverse associations between birth weight and
early and late adult ischemic stroke in both sexes (eTable 1 in
the Supplement). We detected no interactions between birth
weightandBMIatanyagefrom7to13years(P > .05ateachage
using likelihood ratio tests) or change in BMI z score and early

ciations between BMI and ischemic stroke changed little when
adjusting for birth weight (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

 When death was treated as a competing risk, the esti-
mates remained virtually unchanged. In the sensitivity analy-
ses combining 6883 ischemic strokes and 8166 unspecified
strokes (6086 women and 8963 men), we found nonlinear as-
sociations between childhood BMI at ages 7 and 13 years and
ischemic plus unspecified stroke in women and men (eFig-
ures 4 and 5 in the Supplement). The patterns of the associa-
tions were similar to those when only ischemic stroke was the
outcome.
Discussion
In this large population-based cohort study of 307 677 indi-
viduals (8899 ischemic stroke cases), the largest of its kind
among studies identified through our literature search, we
show that in women and men a childhood BMI above average
and a gain in childhood BMI were associated with an in-
creased risk of early (≤55 years) but not late (>55 years) ische-
mic stroke. The risk was significantly elevated in the heaviest
children. In addition, even though low birth weight was asso-
ciated with early and late ischemic stroke in both sexes, we
found that it did not influence the associations between child-
hood BMI and early ischemic stroke.
We dichotomized age at outcome after observing that the
proportional hazards assumption was violated because it
indicated an increased hazard of ischemic stroke due to a
high childhood BMI occurring before but not after age 55
years. We believe that this rationale is reasonable and valid
because it is likely that other, and probably more dominating,
risk factors than childhood BMI, such as hypertension and
type 2 diabetes, are more prevalent later in life, thus evening
out the increased risk of ischemic stroke caused by a high
childhood BMI.

 Compared with the few other studies that have investi-
gated the associations between childhood body size and is-
chemic stroke, we examined a wide range of ages at stroke di-
agnosis separately in women and men. Compared with our
investigation,thenextlargestonthistopicwasaFinnishstudy8
of 12 439 women and men (314 ischemic strokes). It reported
indications of a protective effect of BMI at age 7 years on total
stroke morbidity and mortality but found no differences in the
associations for strokes occurring before or after age 55 years.
Other studies10-13 have investigated total stroke only in women
and men combined and rarely explicitly examined age ef-
fects, thus limiting comparability with our work. Our find-
ings support the hypothesis that the increase in the early-
occurring ischemic stroke incidence is due to a rise in common
stroke risk factors, such as obesity, at younger ages.
In late adolescence and adulthood, BMI has strong asso-
ciations with stroke. In a study27 on total stroke in life among
2.3 million Israeli adolescents (ages 16-19 years) and in a
meta-analysis28 on ischemic stroke that included prospec-
tive studies on 2 million adults, the HRs for individuals clas-
sified as obese compared with an average BMI group were 2.1
and1.68,respectively.Becausetheclassificationofobesityused
in the studies corresponds to a BMI z score of approximately
2 in our study, the reported HRs are similar to our findings for
childhood BMI.
The associations between BMI and early ischemic stroke
have been examined in a few adult studies.7,29 A case-control
study29 on 1201 cases of ischemic stroke diagnosed at ages 15
to 49 years and 1154 controls showed positive associations be-
tween higher BMI and early stroke. The associations per-
sisted after accounting for age, sex, race, and smoking status
and were attenuated after adjustment for concurrent risk fac-
tors, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes.29 It was be-
yondthescopeofourstudytoinvestigatetheinfluenceofadult
risk factors. Our finding of an association between above-
average childhood BMI and early adult ischemic stroke could
reflect tracking of body size from child to adult ages. Previ-
ously, our group reported that overweight children are likely
to become overweight young adults but found that by middle
age the risk decreases because most overweight adults were
heavy irrespective of their childhood body size.30 In the pres-
ent study, we found that the risk of early ischemic stroke is not
limited to the heaviest children but rather that the risk is al-
ready significantly increased from the 75th percentile of our
BMI distribution. Therefore, our results herein may indicate
early initiation of atherosclerotic processes,31 which poten-
tially renders childhood BMI as a prognosticator of early adult
ischemic stroke.
Individualsinthisstudywerebornfromthe1930sthrough
the 1980s. During this period, Danish society changed, with
improvements in living conditions and medical advances in
stroke prevention and management. The socioeconomic sta-
tus of a child’
s family is inversely associated with later stroke
mortality.32 Stroke is associated with several behavioral risk
factors, such as cigarette smoking, excess alcohol consump-
tion, and physical inactivity, which in turn are associated with
less advantageous socioeconomic status.1 Such information
was unavailable in the present study. However, the associa-
tions between BMI and ischemic stroke did not differ herein
by birth cohort, suggesting that they are attributable to bio-
logical factors rather than socioeconomic differences, which
likely have shifted over time.33
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. We investigated a large popu-
lation-based cohort that included practically every child who
attendedschoolinCopenhagen.Thehealthexaminationswere
performed at public and private schools, eliminating selec-
tion bias in the cohort. Measurements obtained by physi-
cians and nurses were used, enhancing validity and reliabil-
ity compared with self-reported data. We had almost complete
follow-up through national registers, and universal health care
was provided in Denmark without direct costs to the patients
throughout the follow-up period. The coverage of each regis-
ter is high, with virtually every event recorded.17,18 In the Dan-
ish National Hospital Register, ischemic strokes are recorded
with a high degree of validity (positive predictive value
>97%),26 but cardiovascular disease diagnoses are less accu-
rate in the Danish National Cause of Death Register.17 More-
over, the analyses of the combined end points of ischemic and
unspecified strokes resembled the results for ischemic stroke
only, which is in accord with the probable shift in diagnoses
from unspecified stroke to ischemic stroke, likely due to the
increased use of imaging techniques in recent years.34
From a public health perspective, the findings from our
study are relevant for children of today because we included
individuals born as late as the 1980s, when the obesity epi-
demicrapidlydeveloped.35Populationattributablefractiones-
timatesofearlyadultischemicstrokewere3.1%amongwomen
and 2.1% among men, which indicated the low overall preva-
lence of overweight and obese children among our cohort.
However,atlevelsofoverweightandobesityfoundamongcon-
temporary American children (approximately 35% in girls and
boys),36 the population attributable fractions of early adult is-
chemic stroke would be as high as 20.3% among women and
16.2% among men. Although these estimates should be inter-
preted cautiously because they assume an unverified causal
association, they nonetheless suggest that the significance of
a high childhood BMI on early adult ischemic stroke may be
substantial. Because childhood obesity is difficult to prevent
and treatment often fails, these findings suggest that the ini-
tiation of early personalized medicine may need to be under-
taken to reduce the risk of early stroke among these individu-
als, in addition to weight reduction or maintenance.
Conclusions
The findings of our study suggest that above-average child-
hood BMI increases the risk of ischemic stroke occurring up
until but not after age 55 years, independent of birth weight.
Increases in BMI during childhood are positively associated
with ischemic stroke occurring before or at age 55 years. Our
results highlight that a high burden of early ischemic stroke
may emerge because millions of children are now overweight
or obese.
