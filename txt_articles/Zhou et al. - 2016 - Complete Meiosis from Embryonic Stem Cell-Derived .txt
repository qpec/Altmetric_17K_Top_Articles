SUMMARY
In vitro generation of functional gametes is a prom-
ising approach for treating infertility, although faithful
replication of meiosis has proven to be a substantial
obstacle to deriving haploid gamete cells in culture.
Here we report complete in vitro meiosis from embry-
onic stem cell (ESC)-derived primordial germ cells
(PGCLCs). Co-culture of PGCLCs with neonatal
testicular somatic cells and sequential exposure to
morphogens and sex hormones reproduced key hall-
marks of meiosis, including erasure of genetic
imprinting, chromosomal synapsis and recombina-
tion, and correct nuclear DNA and chromosomal
content in the resulting haploid cells. Intracytoplas-
mic injection of the resulting spermatid-like cells
into oocytes produced viable and fertile offspring,
showing that this robust stepwise approach can
functionally
recapitulate
male
gametogenesis
in vitro. These findings provide a platform for investi-
gating meiotic mechanisms and the potential gener-
ation of human haploid spermatids in vitro.
INTRODUCTION
In sexually reproducing organisms, transmission of genetic and
epigenetic information between generations relies on gametes,
reproductive cells of the germline that unite at fertilization to
form a new organism. In mammals, germline specification oc-
curs early during embryogenesis, when primordial germ cells
(PGCs) first appear in the extra-embryonic compartment. These
germ cell progenitors undergo a complex developmental pro-
gram involving migration into the developing embryo, coloniza-
tion of the gonadal ridges, proliferation, and eventual progres-
sion through meiosis to form haploid sex-specific germ cells.
Up to 15% of couples are infertile, and many of them have game-
togenesis failure. Therefore, reproducing germ cell development
in vitro has remained a central goal in reproductive biology and
medicine (Sun et al., 2014). The effective production of functional
gametes in culture would not only provide a system to investi-
gate the genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that
shape germ cell development but may also lead to clinical
approaches addressing infertility resulting from defects in
gametogenesis.
The recapitulation of meiosis, a process unique to germ cells,
has remained a major obstacle toward the production of func-
tional gametes in vitro. To avoid misconceptions, a consensus
panel of reproductive biologists has therefore formulated a
panel of ‘‘gold standard’’ criteria for in-vitro-derived gametes
that are based on features that reflect key events of meiosis
(Handel et al., 2014). To prove that meiosis occurred in vitro,
all of the following must be shown: correct nuclear DNA content
at specific meiotic stages (for male cells, pre-meiotic, meiotic
S phase, first reductional, and second meiotic division stages),
normal chromosome number and organization, appropriate
nuclear and chromosomal localization of proteins involved in
homologous synapsis and recombination, and capacity of the
in
vitro-produced
germ
cells
to
produce
viable
euploid
offspring.
The production of mature male germ cells is the result of a
complex developmental program that begins with the specifi-
cation of PGCs during prenatal stages and relies on spermato-
genesis, a complex multi-step expansion and maturation
process that is initiated in the postnatal testis during puberty
and
encompasses
mitotic
proliferation
of
spermatogonia,
meiotic division into haploid germ cells, and spermiogenic dif-
ferentiation.

 (iPSCs) can adopt an epiblast-like developmental program
in vitro and transiently form epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) that
are competent to undergo specification into PGC-like cells
(PGCLCs) (Hayashi et al., 2011; Irie et al., 2015). Upon trans-
plantation of murine PGCLCs into the testis environment, these
further developed into haploid spermatozoa (Hayashi et al.,
2011). In humans, the risk for tumorigenesis prohibits in vivo
transplantation approaches so that the capacity of human
PGCLCs to form spermatozoa remains unexplored. Several
studies have reported the generation of haploid germ cells
in vitro from pluripotent stem cells (Eguizabal et al., 2011; Geij-
sen et al., 2004), but none of these studies provided proof for all
key hallmarks of meiosis, and the functionality of the haploid
germ cells were not fully evaluated. A 3D culture system aimed
at reconstructing mouse seminiferous tubules in vitro sup-
ported sperm formation from neonatal testicular cells. How-
ever, the function of the spermatids obtained with this system
has not been evaluated (Yokonishi et al., 2013). Therefore,
the full recapitulation of spermatogenesis in vitro to produce
functional haploid male gametes has not yet been achieved
but is highly anticipated.
Here we report complete in vitro meiosis from murine ESC-
derived PGCLCs, resulting in the formation of male spermatid-
like cells (SLCs) capable of producing viable fertile offspring via
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). We demonstrate that,
upon co-culture with neonatal testicular somatic cells and
sequential exposure to morphogens and sex hormones, ESC-
derived PGCLCs recapitulate male gametogenesis in vitro, re-
producing hallmarks of erasure of imprints, synapsis, and
recombination.
RESULTS
Specification of PGCLCs from ESCs In Vitro
To visualize key stages during germ cell development from ESCs
in vitro, we derived and used mouse ESC lines transgenic for
fluorescent reporter proteins under the control of regulatory ele-
ments of germ cell markers. For identification of cells resembling
PGCs, we used an ESC line expressing membrane-targeted
Venus (mVenus) under the control of Prdm1 (Blimp1) regulatory
elements and enhanced CFP (ECFP) under the control of
Dppa3 (Stella/Pgc7), marking lineage-restricted PGC precursors
of the proximal epiblast and Prdm1- and Dppa3-positive
migrating PGCs, respectively (Blimp1-mVenus and Stella-
ECFP [BVSC] double-transgenic ESC line). We also used an
ESC line expressing EGFP controlled by the cell-specific sti-
mulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8) promoter, reflecting
early-stage spermatogonia through preleptotene-stage sper-
matocytes (Li et al., 2007). This line also expressed DsRed under
the control of the protamine 1 (Prm1) promoter, identifying post-
meiotic spermatids (Stra8-EGFP and Prm1-DsRed [SGPD] dou-
ble-transgenic ESC line; Figure S1A). Both ESC lines had a
normal karyotype and produced completely ESC-derived live
offspring by tetraploid complementation (Figures S1B and
S1C), confirming pluripotency.
From ground-state SGPD and BVSC ESCs that were main-
tained under serum- and feeder free conditions in the presence
of GSK3 inhibitor and MEK inhibitor (2i) and leukemia inhibitory
factor (LIF), we first induced differentiation into EpiLCs using cul-
ture conditions adapted from a protocol published previously
(Hayashi et al., 2011). In adherent culture, SGPD and BVSC
ESCs underwent EpiLC differentiation when exposed to activin
A and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Figure 1A). This
fate change was associated with a decrease in the expression
of the pluripotency markers NANOG and SOX2, whereas levels
of the pluripotency and germ cell marker OCT4 remained
high (Figure S2A). Expression analysis by real-time RT-PCR
confirmed downregulation of transcripts of multiple pluripotency
and inner cell mass (ICM) marker genes, including Prdm14,
Zfp42, Tbx3, Tcl1, Esrrb, Klf2, Klf4, and Klf5, whereas transcripts
of the epiblast marker genes Fgf5 and Wnt3 and of Dnmt3b
became upregulated (Figure S2B). Transcripts of endoderm
marker genes (Gata4, Gata6, Sox17, and Blimp1) were ex-
pressed at low levels during differentiation.
Subsequent floating culture of EpiLC in an N2B27-based
differentiation medium containing a cytokine mix of BMP-4,
BMP-8a, epidermal growth factor (EGF), SCF, and LIF (Hayashi
et al., 2011) resulted in robust activation of Blimp1-mVenus and
Stella-ECFP after 4–6 days, suggesting induction of PGCLCs
(Figure 1B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for the
PGC markers integrin b3 and SSEA1 yielded 11.2% double-
positive cells (Figure 1C). We next evaluated whether changes
in gene expression, histone modification, and allele-specific
methylation patterns associated with PGC commitment were
recapitulated in our culture system. Comparison of expression
profiles of SGPD ESC-derived EpiLCs and day 6 PGCLC ag-
gregates revealed upregulation of transcripts of pluripotency
genes, including Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, in PGCLCs (Fig-
ure 1D). Similarly, transcript levels of PGC-related genes,
including Blimp1, Prdm14, Tcfap2c, Nanos3, Stella, Tdrd5,
Dnd1, Dnmt1, Ddx4, and Dazl, increased, whereas those of
somatic cell-related genes such hoxa1 and hoxb1 and other
genes, including Dnmt3a/3b, Np95, and c-Myc, became down-
regulated. This gene expression profile resembles that of in vivo
PGCs (Kurimoto et al., 2008; Saitou et al., 2002), confirming
in vitro PGCLC specification (Hayashi et al., 2011). Analysis of
epigenetic profiles by western blot demonstrated similar dy-
namics of histone modification as observed during PGC forma-
tion in vivo (Seki et al., 2005) and PGCLC induction in vitro, with
a transient increase and reduction of histone H3 lysine 9 dime-
thylation (H3K9me2) and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation
(H3K27me3), respectively, during formation of EpiLCs, followed

 by the inverse pattern in PGCLCs (Figure 1E; Hayashi et al.,
2011; Seki et al., 2005). Bisulfite sequencing of differentially
methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate mono-allelic expres-
sion of the imprinted genes Snrpn and H19 from the paternal
and maternal allele, respectively, revealed a reduction of
methylation that may indicate that erasure of imprinting was
initiated in SGPD PGCLCs (Figure 1F). Collectively, both
SGPD and BVSC ESCs were induced effectively to form
PGCLCs.
Initiation of Meiosis in PGCLCs In Vitro in Co-culture
Completion
of
spermatogenesis
from
in
vitro-produced
PGCLCs has only been achieved after transplantation into
mouse testes using the germ cell-deficient KITW/KITW-V mouse
model to ensure the donor origin of haploid cells (Hayashi et al.,
2011). To reconstitute an in vitro environment compatible with
meiotic progression, we pursued co-culture of PGCLCs with
early postnatal testicular cells from KITW/KITW-V mice. In male
mice, fetal-stage gonadal somatic cells express high levels of
CYP26B1, which metabolizes endogenous retinoic acid (RA),
thereby prohibiting entry of male germ cells into meiosis
(Bowles et al., 2006; MacLean et al., 2007). Initiation of meiosis
remains suppressed in the male gonad until after birth (Zhou
et al., 2008). Consistent with this, we found that early postnatal
somatic testicular cells express low levels of CYP26B1, compa-
rable with those of the female fetal gonad at the stage of
meiotic induction of PGCs at embryonic day (E) 13.5 (Anderson
et al., 2008; McLaren, 2003; Figure S3A). Therefore, early post-
natal testicular cells of KITW/KITW-V mice may represent a
permissive environment for the initiation of meiosis (Zhou
et al., 2008) despite developmental asynchrony. We used a
mixed cell culture system of SGPD PGCLCs and KITW/KITW-V
testicular cells at a ratio of 1:1.
An RA signal is required during meiotic induction (Bowles
et al., 2006; Menke et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2008), and path-
ways responsive to activin A and BMP-2/4/7 (BMPs) regulate
postnatal germ cell development, including self-renewal (Hu
et al., 2004; Puglisi et al., 2004). To assess the effect of these
morphogens on the initiation of meiosis in vitro, we exposed
co-cultures of SSEA1 and integrin b3 double-positive PGCLCs
and KITW/KITW-V testicular cells to different combinations of
activin A, BMPs, and RA (Figure 1A). Only in cultures supple-
mented with all three morphogens (activin A, BMPs, and RA)
did Stra8-EGFP-expressing cells become apparent within
3 days of exposure, suggesting the initiation of meiosis in
SGPD PGCLCs in vitro (Figure 2A). Gene expression analysis
revealed that increased transcript levels of the germ cell
markers Nanos3 and Ddx4 were detectable in all cultures
exposed to activin A and BMPs. However, only co-cultures
additionally supplemented with RA exhibited a marked upregu-
lation of the meiosis markers Stra8 and Dmc1 after day 6 (Fig-
ure 2B). The expression level of Rec8, another target of RA but
independent of Stra8 (Koubova et al., 2014), was higher when
treated with RA than that without RA treatment after day 6 (Fig-
ure 2B). Cells not exposed to activin A or BMPs exhibited poor
proliferation capacity (Figure 2C). In co-cultures exposed to all
three morphogens, we observed that testis somatic cells
migrated
actively
toward
PGCLCs,
forming
aggregation
colonies with Stra8-EGFP-expressing cells within 6 days (Movie
S1). Prm1-DsRed expression was not detected at this time. 336
of the 400 (84%) colonies showed Stra8-EGFP-positive signals.
The Stra8-EGFP-positive colonies were positive for markers of
germ cells (DDX4), testis somatic cells (GATA4), and Sertoli
cells (SOX9), whereas the PGC markers SSEA1 and OCT4
were undetectable (Figure 2D). SGPD PGCLCs had therefore
differentiated from a PGC/spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) state
and integrated into colonies comprised of multiple testicular
cell types, including KITW/KITW-V testicular somatic cells. In
BVSC
double-positive
PGCLCs,
downregulation
of
the
Blimp1-mVenus
and
Stella-ECFP
signal
occurred
within
3 days of co-culture in the presence of all three morphogens,
supporting this hypothesis (Figure S3B). This synchronous
process resembles the behavior of PGCs in the E13.5 female
genital
ridge,
which
simultaneously
enter
meiosis
in the
following few days. Our co-culture conditions therefore recon-
stitute a microenvironment that triggers the initiation of meiosis
in germ cells.
Hormonal Stimulation Induces the Formation of Haploid
SLCs In Vitro
Sex hormones, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and
testosterone (T) regulate the progression of meiosis in mice
(O’Shaughnessy, 2014). Starting on day 7 of co-culture, we
therefore withdrew morphogens (Activin A, BMRs, and RA
[ABR]) and exposed SGPD-derived cultures to combinations of
FSH, bovine pituitary extract (BPE), and T. In the presence of
FSH/BPE/T, postmeiotic Prm1-DsRed-expressing cells became
first detectable on day 10 (Figure 3A), and strong reporter
expression on day 14 correlated with upregulation of haploid
spermatid markers such as Tp1, Prm1, acrosin, and haprin. In
contrast, cultures supplemented with fewer hormone factors
did not contain Prm1-DsRed-expressing cells. A slight upregula-
tion of Sycp3 was detectable in cultures exposed to BPE and T
(Figure 3B). In the presence of FSH/BPE/T, 14% of cells were
identified to have 1C DNA content on day 14 of culture, indicating
the formation of haploid male SLCs. Less than 3% of SLCs were
detectable in cultures not exposed to FSH, and SLCs were ab-
sent from cultures without BPE or T (Figure 3C), indicating that
all three hormones were required for progression of meiosis.
No 1C cells could be induced from the somatic cells on
day 14, even in the presence of FSH/BPE/T (Figure 3C). In
addition to FSH, BPE contains a variety of growth factors and
hormones. Therefore, it is possible that factors other than FSH
contribute to the observed completion of meiosis in vitro with
FSH, T, and BPE stimulation.
In FSH/BPE/T-supplemented cultures, haploid cells were first
detectable around day 10 and increased over the next 4 days to
14%–20%. Approximately half of the haploid cells expressed
Prm1-DsRed on day 14 (Figure 4A). Cells had a normal karyotype
during metaphase of meiosis I (Figure 4B).
Chromosome Synapsis and Recombination in Meiosis
In Vitro
To observe the progression of meiosis during culture, we
assessed chromosomal synapsis and recombination/cross-
over. These processes require the initiation and resolution of
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Nuclear spreads of differen-
tiating cells on day 8 contained multiple SPO11 and RAD51

 foci, reflecting the generation of DSBs (Aravind et al., 1998;
Keeney et al., 1997) and their resolution by homologous re-
combination repair (Neale and Keeney, 2006), respectively
(Figure 4C; Figures S3C–S3F). Furthermore, we found that the
distribution of phosphorylated H2A histone family member X
(gH2AX) recapitulated that of meiotic progression in vivo. Broad
distribution throughout the nucleus in day 8 cells (Figure 4C;
Figure S3C) reflected an association with DSBs, and disap-
pearance from the autosome region on day 10 and accumula-
tion on the unsynapsed sex chromosomes (Mahadevaiah et al.,
2001) suggested completion of synapsis similar to pachytene
stage spermatocytes in vivo (Figure 4C). The nuclei of in vitro
spermatocytes were positive for SYCP1, a component of trans-

complex (Lammers et al., 1994; Meuwis-
sen et al., 1992), and also contained
lateral (SYCP3) elements (Eijpe et al.,
2000), suggesting progression of synap-
sis. Quantitative analysis revealed that,
after 8 days of differentiation in vitro,
more than 90% of the primary spermato-
cytes were at the leptotene or zygotene
stage of meiosis. On day 10, 64% were
in the pachytene stage, indicating the
successful repair of DNA DSBs and
completion of synapsis, and more than
50% of the spermatocytes had entered
the diplotene stage by day 12 (Figure 4D).
These results demonstrated that meiosis
in
vitro
encompassed
synapsis
and
recombination and was synchronized in
the majority of germ cells. Consistent
with this, we found that upregulation of
transcripts of meiotic factors occurred
in a programmed manner, similar to
one cycle of meiotic division in vivo (Fig-
ure
4E).

levels increased gradually from day 0 to day 10 and then drop-
ped sharply on day 14, consistent with progression to the
diplotene stage, and upregulation of haploid spermatid marker
transcripts such as Prm1, haprin, and acrosin was most prom-
inent on day 14. FACS of Prm1-DsRed-expressing SLCs on
day 14 yielded approximately 2 3 104 SLCs/culture well.
Because meiotic progression of a single PGCLC would result
in four SLCs, the estimated conversion rate from PGCLCs
(5 3 104 PGCLCs plated per well) to SLCs was about 10%.
Dividing Prm1-DsRed-positive cells were present in co-cultures
on day 12, indicating the formation of haploid cells (Movie S2).

 Healthy Fertile Offspring Produced by ICSI with In Vitro-
Derived SLCs
Sorted SLCs contained a cap-shaped acrosome (Figure 5A). To
validate genome integrity, we performed 0.13 whole genome
sequencing of single sorted SLCs. Of eight small and round cells
selected for sequencing (Figure 5B), six were haploid cells with
normal genome structure, one cell was haploid with chromo-
somal deletions, and one was diploid (Figure S4). The presence
of diploid cells was not unexpected because the Prm1-DsRed-
positive population contained diploid cells (Figure 4A), and we
chose not to select cells for DNA content to avoid interference
with sequencing. Bisulfite sequencing revealed male germ cell-
specific differential methylation at the imprinted H19 and Snrpn
loci comparable with that of in vivo round spermatids (Figure 5C).

Global transcription profile clustering ana-
lyses revealed the similarity of in vitro
SLCs to in vivo spermatids (Figure 5D).
These analyses also confirmed that global
transcription profiles of SSEA1/integrin b3
double-positive PGCLCs on day 6 clus-
tered closely with those of SSEA1/integrin
b3 double-positive PGCs from E12.5 male
fetuses but differed from ESCs and differ-
entiated germ cells.
We next performed ICSI with sorted
in vitro-derived SLCs. Of 63 and 125 oo-
cytes injected with SGPD-derived SLCs
in two replicates, 51 and 107 developed
to the two-cell stage after activation,
respectively.

of
SGPD-derived two-cell stage embryos,
we obtained six full-term pups that were

sequencing indicated a pattern associ-
ated with maternal and paternal genetic
contributions
(Figure

The

developed normally to adulthood. Em-
bryos resulting from ICSI with BVSC-derived SLCs (Figure S5A)
expressed Stella-ECFP at the four-cell stage (Figure S5B). Em-
bryo transfer resulted in three live pups that were positive for
the Blimp1-mVenus and Stella-ECFP transgenes, had a normal
karyotype, and exhibited normal weight gain after birth (Figures
S5C–S5F). The birth rate following ICSI with round spermatids
isolated from normal testis was 9.5% (Table 1). Genome-wide
reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) of tail tip
fibroblast of a male and a female offspring derived from
BVSC ESCs was performed to analyze the whole-genome
methylation status of the offspring with normal male and
female mice as controls. The genome-wide methylation data
of sperm and oocyte by Shen et al. (2014) were included in
the analysis. The proportions of high methylation sites (>80%)

 of the BVSC-derived offspring and control mice were all lower
than that of sperm but higher than that of the oocyte (Fig-
ure S5G), which is consistent with the lower methylation levels
of somatic cells. The clustering analysis showed that the
BVSC-derived male offspring was clustered together with the
male control (Figure S5H). Additionally, imprinting regions
from BVSC-derived offspring and control mice were analyzed,
and all showed a 50% methylation level (Figure S5I). Therefore,
BVSC ESC-derived offspring had a normal methylation level. All
of these mice developed to adulthood and had offspring (Fig-
ure S5J). These data demonstrate the generation of functional
spermatids in vitro from both SGPD and BVSC ESC lines. In

summary, we describe the successful
generation of ESC-derived spermatids
in vitro that fully conform to the gold
standards proposed for in vitro-derived
germ cells (Handel et al., 2014).
DISCUSSION
Here
we
report
the
first
successful
generation
of
functional
spermatids,
conforming to the gold standards of
in-vitro-derived germ cells, from plu-
ripotent stem cells by stepwise diff-
erentiation
in
vitro.
Specifically,
we
demonstrate that mouse ESC-derived
PGCLCs entered meiosis in vitro, under-
going key processes of in vivo meiosis,
including chromosomal synapsis and
recombination, and finally differentiated
into haploid SLCs. These SLCs suc-
cessfully fertilized oocytes by ICSI, and
the resulting embryos underwent em-
bryonic development, resulting in fertile
offspring that gave birth to the next gen-
eration.
This
unequivocally
demon-
strates the recapitulation of meiosis in
a culture environment and proves the
functionality of spermatids generated from pluripotent stem
cells in vitro.
To establish an efficient approach for in vitro meiosis and
gametogenesis, we adapted a method used to differentiate
EpiLCs into PGCLCs from a protocol published previously (Hay-
ashi et al., 2011) using N2B27 as basal medium for PGCLC in-
duction. N2B27 is a chemically defined medium that contains
the RA precursor vitamin A and insulin. This medium supports
the ground-state pluripotency of ESCs when supplemented
with 2i and is used frequently as a basal medium to promote
neural differentiation from pluripotent cells. We presume that
continued exposure to N2B27, which constituted the basal

 medium for EpiLC induction, resulted in the formation of
PGCLCs that were capable of undergoing meiosis in vitro. This
is supported by our findings from global transcription profiling,
which revealed that the ESC-derived PGCLCs generated in our
study clustered closely with E12.5 PGCs (Figure 4 D), a develop-
mental stage close to entry into meiosis in vivo. In the mouse
germline, female PGCs enter meiosis at E13.5 (McLaren,
2003). This is triggered by the release of endogenous RA from
the mesonephros (Anderson et al., 2008). In contrast, in the
male, initiation of meiosis remains suppressed until after birth

(Zhou et al., 2008) because high levels
of
CYP26B1
expressed
by
somatic
cells of the fetal male gonad degrade
endogenous RA (Bowles et al., 2006;
MacLean et al., 2007). Here we exposed
PGCLCs resembling E12.5 PGCs to con-
ditions supporting their entry into meiosis
by
identification
of
morphogens
that
induced upregulation of meiosis path-
ways and by providing a culture environ-
ment with postnatal somatic testicular
cells expressing low CYP26B1 levels
(Figure S3A).
We found that simultaneous exposure
of PGCLCs to activin A, BMPs, and RA
resulted in rapid silencing of Blimp1
and Stella and subsequent upregulation
of Stra8 expression, resulting in initiation
of meiosis and changes in gene expres-
sion that resemble those of in vivo differ-
entiating germ cells (Figure 1; Kurimoto
et al., 2008; Saitou et al., 2002). Consistent with previous
observations demonstrating that BMPs and activin A are
required for the self-renewal (Hu et al., 2004; Puglisi et al.,
2004) and proliferation of neonatal germ cells (Mithraprabhu
et al., 2010), our results also suggest that BMPs and activin A
are
essential
for
the
proliferation
of
meiosis-competent
PGCLCs in culture, whereas RA is required to induce regulatory
networks that lead to meiotic entry and differentiation.
Under our culture conditions, the ESC-derived PGCLCs failed
to differentiate into SSCs capable of self-renewal in vitro, evident

337
 from the absence of SSC-specific genes in PGCLC-derived
germ cells. We presume that the in vitro culture system lacks fea-
tures of the testicular microenvironment at the basement mem-
brane required for SSC maintenance, including lack of growth
factors required for SSC self-renewal, such as glial cell line-
derived neurotropic factor (GDNF), bFGF, or EGF, among others
(Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2003; Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shino-
hara, 2013; Kubota et al., 2004).
We observed that, during induction of meiotic differentiation in
co-cultures,
KITW/KITW-V
neonatal
testicular
cells
formed
colonies with PGCLCs by active cellular migration. Stimulated
by RA, the PGCLCs synchronously passed a SSCs-like state
and entered meiosis, reminiscent of PGCs in the E13.5 female
genital ridge, which simultaneously enter meiosis at this stage
(McLaren, 2003).
We found that differentiation of PGCLCs into male postmeiotic
germ cells in vitro required simultaneous exposure to the sex
hormones testosterone, FSH, and BPE. This reflects the depen-
dence of in vivo spermatogenesis on pituitary FSH and locally
produced testicular androgens, including testosterone. FSH
supports Sertoli cell proliferation and stimulates mitotic division
of spermatogonia, maintaining adequate cell counts (O’Shaugh-
nessy, 2014). The requirement for BPE for spermatogenesis
in vitro suggests that other pituitary factors promote meiotic pro-
gression and spermatid differentiation. These may include lutei-
nizing hormone (LH), which normally stimulates the secretion of
testosterone from Leydig cells but has also been implied in the
maintenance of meiotic germ cells (O’Shaughnessy et al.,
2009). The analysis and screening of pituitary tissues for factors
affecting in vitro germ cell differentiation may further improve
protocols for in vitro meiosis.
In summary, we demonstrate a robust approach toward the
stepwise differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into haploid
SLCs in vitro. The in vitro meiosis fully complies with the gold
standards of meiosis, including erasure of imprints, synapsis,
and recombination. Our findings could facilitate the generation
of haploid human spermatids in vitro with the prospect of treating
male infertility.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Derivation of BVSC and SGPD ESCs
BVSC transgenic mice (Ohinata et al., 2008) were provided by Mitinori Saitou.
Stra8-EGFP transgenic mice and Prm1-DsRed transgenic mice were gener-
ated by pronuclear injection of Stra8-EGFP and Prm1-DsRed plasmids (Nayer-
nia et al., 2006), a gift from Wolfgang Engel (University of Go
¨ ttingen). ESCs
were derived from blastocyst-stage embryos by standard culture on mouse
feeder layers in 2i medium (Ying et al., 2008). For feeder-free culture, ESCs
were maintained on dishes coated with poly-L-ornithine (0.01%; Sigma) and
laminin (300 ng/ml, Invitrogen). All cell lines were negative for mycoplasma.
All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of
the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Induction of EpiLCs and PGCLCs
Differentiation of ESCs into EpiLCs and PGCLCs was induced by culture con-
ditions adapted from a protocol published previously with minor modifications
(Hayashi et al., 2011). For EpiLC differentiation, 1 3 105 ESCs/well were plated
in a 12-well plate coated with 16.7 mg/ml human plasma fibronectin in N2B27
medium supplemented with activin A, bFGF, and 1% knockout serum replace-
ment (KSR). For PGCLC formation in floating culture, 2 3 103 EpiLCs/well were
plated in a low cell-binding, U-bottom, 96-well plate (Corning Life Sciences) in
modified N2B27 medium (N2B27 with 15% KSR, BMP-4, LIF, SCF, BMP-8a,
and EGF). Cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37�C. The medium was changed
daily.
In Vitro Spermatogenesis
Testes of 2- to 8-day postpartum (dpp) KitW/ KitW-V mice were harvested and
digested by a two-step enzyme digestion method as described previously
(Bellve
´ , 1993; Bellve
´
et al., 1977). Briefly, testes were dispersed with
1 mg/ml collagenase type IV at 37�C for 10 min, followed by digestion in
0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA for 10 min at 37�C. A single cell suspension was
obtained after filtration through a 70-mm cell strainer, and cells were collected
by centrifugation. PGCLCs were mixed with KitW/KitW-V mouse testicular cells
at a ratio of 1 to 1. From day 0 to day 6, cells were cultured in aMEM supple-
mented with 10% KSR, BMP-2/4/7 (20 ng/ml each, R&D Systems), retinoic
acid (10�6 M, Sigma), and activin A (100 ng/ml, R&D Systems). From days
7–14, cells were cultured in aMEM containing 10% KSR, testosterone
(10 mM, Acros Organics), FSH (200 ng/ml, Sigma), and BPE (50 mg/ml, Corning
Life Sciences). The medium was changed every 2 days. Cells were cultured in
5% CO2 at 37�C.
Immunostaining
Cells or seminiferous tubules were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde
at room temperature, blocked for 30 min with 0.3% Triton X-100/2% BSA in
PBS, and incubated with primary antibodies against OCT4 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology),
NANOG
(Millipore),
SSEA1
(Millipore),
DDX4
(Abcam),
BLIMP1 (Abcam), STRA8 (Abcam), and GATA4 (Abcam). After overnight incu-
bation at 4�C, samples were washed three times in PBS, followed by incuba-
tion with secondary antibodies or/and peanut agglutinin (PNA) (10 mg/ml,
Sigma) for 1 hr. Secondary antibodies were labeled with fluorescein isothiocy-
anate (FITC), Cy3, and Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). DNA was counter-
stained with 10 mg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 15 min, followed by three washes
with PBS. Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM780 Meta inverted confocal
microscope.
Western Blotting
PGCLCs were collected into cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 10 mM
NaCl, and 0.5% NP-40) containing protease inhibitor (Roche) for 30 min on ice.
Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 3 g for 20 min at 4�C, and the resulting
supernatants separated by electrophoresis and western blotting using anti-
bodies against H3K27me3 (Millipore), H3K9me2 (Millipore), and H3 (Millipore).
Karyotype
After culture in medium supplemented with 0.025% colchicine for 6–8 hr, cells
were subject to hypotonic treatment with 1% sodium citrate for 30 min at room
temperature (RT), followed by fixation in freshly prepared methanol/acetic acid

 (3:1) for 2 hr with three replacements of fixative. The coverslip was removed
using dry ice. Chromosomes were visualized by Giemsa staining. Images
were captured on a Leica DM 6000 B microscope.
DNA and RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR
DNA and RNA from mouse tail tips or cell pellets were extracted with a
MicroElute genomic DNA kit (OMEGA) or an RNeasy micro/mini kit (QIAGEN),
respectively. Reverse transcription was performed using a QuantiTect reverse
transcription kit (QIAGEN). PCR and real-time PCR were performed with gene-
specific primers (Table S1). All gene expression analyses were performed with
samples from three independent differentiation experiments.
Flow Cytometry Analysis
PGCLCs were dissociated in 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA, re-suspended in PBS
supplemented with 1% BSA, filtered through a 40-mm nylon mesh, and incu-
bated with SSEA1-AF647-conjugated mouse monoclonal immunoglobulin M
(IgM) (eBioscience) and Integrin b3-FITC-conjugated mouse monoclonal
IgG1 (BioLegend) for 30 min at 37�C. For ploidy analysis, single-cell suspen-
sions were stained with 10 mg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 20 min and washed three
times with PBS. FACS analysis was performed using the FACS Calibur system
(Becton Dickinson).
Bisulfite Sequencing
Sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA was performed using the EZ DNA methyl-
ation-direct kit (Zymo Research). PCR amplification was performed using
hot start (HS) DNA polymerase (TAKARA) with specific primers for H19 and
Snprn DMR imprinting regions (Table S1). The PCR product was gel-extracted,
subcloned into the pMD18T vector (TAKARA), and sequenced. The resulting
data were analyzed using a web-based tool, Quantification Tool for Methyl-
ation Analysis (QUMA, http://quma.cdb.riken.jp/).
Chromosomal Spreads
Cultured cells were digested into single-cell suspensions. Chromosomal
spreads were prepared using a hypotonic bursting technique (Peters et al.,
1997). Primary antibodies were Sycp3 (Abcam), Sycp1 (Abcam), gH2AX
(Abcam), Rad 51 (Santa Cruz), and Spo11 (provided by Scott Keeney) (Lange
et al., 2011). Secondary antibodies were FITC-, Cy3-, Cy5-, and DyLight 405-
labeled (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Images were captured with Zeiss
LSM780 Meta inverted confocal microscope. Super-resolution analysis was
performed using a Zeiss Elyra PS.1 microscope system.
Global Expression Analysis
Global transcription profiles of SSEA1/integrin b3 double-positive, day 6
PGCLCs, SSEA1/integrin b3 double-positive PGCs from male E12.5 fetuses,
and individual sorted SLCs and spermatids were determined by microarray
as described previously (NCBI GEO: GSE71478) (Zhao et al., 2009). Published
ESC data (NCBI GEO: GSE16925) (Zhao et al., 2009) were used for unsuper-
vised hierarchical clustering.
Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection and Embryo Transfer
ICSI was performed as described previously (Li et al., 2012). SLCs were
exposed to 5 mg/ml cytochalasin B in M2, and individual cells were injected
into pre-activated mature oocytes with a Piezo-driven pipette, followed by
culture in activation medium for 5 hr. Two-cell embryos were transferred to
the oviduct of CD1 pseudopregnant females or further cultured to blastocyst
stage in vitro, followed by embryo transfer into the uteri of recipient females.
Full-term pups were delivered naturally or by cesarean section.
RRBS Library Preparation and Data Analysis
For RRBS, the libraries were generated and the data were analyzed as
described previously (Gu et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2014; Yamaguchi et al.,
2013). Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500
sequencer (NCBI GEO: GSE76238). RRBS datasets of wild-type meiosis II
(MII)
oocyte
and
sperm
were
downloaded
from
the
GEO
database
(GSE61331) (Shen et al., 2014). The sequencing reads were trimming by
Trim Galore (Babraham Bioinformatics) with the ‘‘-rrbs’’ option and then
mapped to the mouse genome (mm9 version) by Bismark v0.13.1 (Babraham
Bioinformatics). The methylation levels of covered cytosine sites were calcu-
lated by dividing the number of reported C with the total number of reported
C and T. Only the CpG sites that were covered by no less than ten reads
were used for the next analysis. The hierarchical clustering was produced by
the hcluster functions of R with the ‘‘euclidean’’ and ‘‘ward’’ Parameters. The
Pearson correlation coefficients were generated using the lm function in R.
The heatmaps were plotted by the heatmap.2 function in R. Histograms of
methylation level distribution were drawn by ggplot2. Point plots were pro-
duced by the smoothScatter functions in R.
