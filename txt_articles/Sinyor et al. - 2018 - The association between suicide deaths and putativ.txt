S
uicide is a major, global public health issue that accounts 
for at least 800 000 deaths per year worldwide.1 A sub-
stantial body of literature shows that media reports relat-
ing to suicide can influence some people to end their lives.2–12 
This phenomenon, known as the Werther effect, is thought to 
occur via social learning, whereby a vulnerable person identifies 
with someone portrayed in the media and copies his or her 
behaviour.5–7,13–21 Studies in Australia, Austria and the United 
States have identified potentially harmful elements of media 
reporting associated with increased rates of subsequent sui-
cide.5,6,21 These include repetitive reporting, front-page story 
placement, reports about suicides by jumping, suicide death 
(rather than ideation or attempts), suicide pacts, including the 
word “suicide” or the suicide method in the headline, accompa-
nying photos, “monocausal” (single cause and effect) explana-
tions for suicide, and reports that included misinformation 
(“public myths”) about suicide.5,6,21 However, these elements 
were not tested or significant in all studies.
A second phenomenon, called the Papageno effect, has been 
proposed whereby protective factors in reports on suicide may 
lead readers to initiate adaptive behaviours, resulting in fewer 
suicide deaths.5 In Austria, newspaper articles depicting “mas-
tery of suicide,” in which people experienced suicidal ideation 
but found solutions other than suicidal behaviour, were associ-
ated with decreased subsequent suicides.5
Responsible media reporting is one of a limited number of 
strategies, which also include restriction of means and school-
based awareness programs, that may affect suicide rates at a 
popu 
lation level.22–24 Worldwide, numerous guidelines have been 
developed to advise the media on best practices.25–29 Journalists 
and media organizations can modify their content and are tasked 
with the challenge of balancing concerns about contagion with the

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Exposure to media 
reporting on suicide can lead to suicide 
contagion and, in some circumstances, 
may also lead to help-seeking behav-
iour. There is limited evidence for which 
specific characteristics of media reports 
mediate these phenomena.
METHODS: This observational study 
examined associations between puta-
tively harmful and protective elements of 
media reports about suicide in 13 major 
publications in the Toronto media market 
and subsequent suicide deaths in Toronto 
(2011–2014). We used multivariable logis-
tic regression to determine whether spe-
cific article characteristics were associ-
ated with increases or decreases in suicide 
deaths in the 7 days after publication, 
compared with a control window.
RESULTS: From 2011 to 2014, there were 
6367 articles with suicide as the major 
focus and 947 suicide deaths. Elements 
most strongly and independently associ-
ated with increased suicides were a 
statement about the inevitability of sui-
cide (odds ratio [OR] 1.97, confidence 
interval [CI] 1.07–3.62), about asphyxia 
by a method other than car exhaust 
(OR 1.72, CI 1.36–2.18), about suicide by 
jumping from a building (OR 1.70, 
CI 1.28–2.26) or about suicide pacts 
(OR 1.63, CI 1.14–2.35), or a headline that 
included the suicide method (OR 1.41, CI 
1.07–1.86). Elements most strongly and 
independently associated with 
decreased suicides were unfavourable 
characteristics (negative judgments 
about the deceased; OR 1.85, CI 1.20–
2.84), or mentions of railway (OR 1.61, CI 
1.10–2.36) and cutting or stabbing (OR 
1.59, CI 1.19–2.13) deaths, and individual 
murder-suicide (OR 1.50, CI 1.23–1.84).
INTERPRETATION: This large study identi-
fied significant associations between sev-
eral specific elements of media reports 
and suicide deaths. It suggests that 
reporting on suicide can have a meaning-
ful impact on suicide deaths and that jour-
nalists and media outlets and organiza-
tions should carefully consider the specific 
content of reports before publication.

public’s right to be informed.30 A detailed understanding of the 
specific aspects of media reports that may provoke suicide conta-
gion is needed to help the media make these decisions; however, 
evidence identifying the “active ingredients” in media reporting 
that may mediate suicide contagion or adaptive behaviour 
remains limited. The studies above have established an eviden-
tiary starting point from which the relative harmful or protective 
contributions of specific elements in media reports may begin to 
be unpacked. However, replication of findings across regions and 
cultures is also needed. The aim of this study is a comprehensive 
examination of the impact of putatively harmful and protective 
content of suicide reporting in print and online media on suicide 
death in Toronto, Canada’s largest urban centre.
Methods
Media data
Print and online media reports relating to suicide in the Toronto 
media market from 2011 to 2014 were the exposure of interest. We 
identified the 12 major Canadian publications that account for the 
large majority of traditional news circulation in the Toronto mar-
ket, and 1 US newspaper with high circulation in Toronto (Box 1). 
Because of the large volume of articles, we hired Infomart, Cana-
da’s leading media consultancy; the study investigators trained 
Infomart personnel to identify and code articles using an elec-
tronic database (for full details, see Appendix 1, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170698/-/DC1).
Coding and abstraction strategy
Articles were coded for content (Appendix 1). We explicitly derived 
putatively harmful and protective elements from 2009 Canadian 
Psychiatric Association reporting guidelines for media.29
We coded all variables independently of each other. That is, an 
article could be coded as being about suicide in both men and 
women if both were described. Likewise, an article that included 
both a statement of approval of suicide and a message of hope 
would have been coded as having both. Given the potential subjec-
tivity inherent to some of these categorizations (e.g., whether an 
article included glorified or romanticized reasons for the suicide), 
we conducted inter-rater reliability tests, all of which included both 
a scientific content expert and an expert in journalism. We corres-
ponded and held regular meetings throughout the process of 
abstraction to clarify points of uncertainty. We performed reliability 
tests initially, after every approximately 1000 articles coded, and at 
completion (for Κ values, see Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170698/-/DC1).
Suicide deaths
The population of suicide deaths includes a consecutive list of 
people whom the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario deter-
mined to have died by suicide in the city of Toronto between 
Jan. 1, 2011 and Dec. 31, 2014, inclusive. Detailed methods of 
data abstraction of the Office of the Chief Coroner have been 
published previously (Appendix 1).31
Statistical analysis
We conducted analyses only on “major focus” articles (Appendix 1) 
from 2011 to 2014. The primary outcome variable of interest was 
the difference (∆) between the number of suicide deaths in the 
week after publication (this post-item period included the date of 
publication — “day 0” — and 6 subsequent days) compared with a 
pre-item control window with a 1-week lag (d –14 to –8) to ensure 
separation from other media reports of the same event that might 
have occurred just before day 0. We tested the impact of the vol-
ume of reports by including a continuous variable — a count of all 
articles relating to suicide published between day –14 and day 0.
We first conducted bivariate analyses under 2 conditions. Fol-
lowing previously established methods,5,6 article characteristics 
were compared for ∆ > 0 (i.e., periods in which there were more 
suicide deaths after the article) versus ∆ ≤ 0 (i.e., periods where 
there were the same number or fewer deaths after the article). 
We did this to test for a potential harmful effect. We conducted a 
second set of bivariate comparisons to test for a potential pro-
tective effect, this time comparing ∆ < 0 to ∆ ≥ 0, to identify arti-
cle characteristics associated with fewer suicide deaths subse-
quent to publication.
The primary analyses involved 2 multivariable logistic regres-
sions to determine the independent predictive contributions of 
media content characteristics on bivariate change in suicide 
deaths, the first for harmful and the second for protective associ-
ations. We included the variables that were significant in their 
respective bivariate analyses. We determined multicollinearity 
via tolerance (< 0.40) and variance inflation factor (< 2.5) values. 
We performed sensitivity analyses to test the impact of print ver-
sus online publications, as well as early (2011–2012) versus late 
(2013–2014) publication.
Significance was determined at a threshold of 0.05 for all 
variables.

Results
From 2011 to 2014, there were 16 845 articles relating to suicide 
across the 13 publications, including 6367 (37.8%) in which suicide 
was the major focus of the article (41.9% of these were online). Of 
the major focus subset, 314 (4.9%) appeared on the front page and 
1736 (27.3%) included the word “suicide” in the headline. Over the 
same span, there were 947 suicide deaths (mean deaths per year ± 
standard deviation: 236.8 ± 22.6) in Toronto (demographic and 
suicide-specific characteristics shown in Table 1).
Bivariate comparisons
Tables 2 and 3 show bivariate analyses testing for increases and 
decreases in suicide frequencies in the week following publication 
of articles with different general content and putatively harmful or 
protective elements, respectively, from 2011 to 2014. Elements 
associated with more suicides in both harmful and protective com-
parisons were articles that focused on older adults, suicide pacts, 
jumping from a building, firearm death, and asphyxia other than by 
car exhaust, as well as those that identified the deceased as a 
celebrity. Mention of the suicide method in the headline and in the 
text, as well as a statement that suicide is inevitable, were all asso-
ciated with increased suicides in the harmful effect analysis.
A higher number of recent articles related to suicide was associ-
ated with decreased suicides in both the harmful effect (odds ratio 
[OR] 0.995, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.994–0.996) and protective 
effect (OR 0.997, 95% CI 0.995–0.998) analyses. Other elements 
associated with fewer suicides in both comparisons were articles 
that focused on youth, a specific person’s suicidality or death, pub-
lic policy, railway deaths and cutting or stabbing deaths. Articles 
about a specific person’s suicide death, articles about murder-
suicide, articles with monocausal explanations for suicide, articles 
highlighting unfavourable characteristics of the deceased (i.e., 
characterological or personal flaws or criminality) and articles 
including interviews with bereaved people were all associated with 
a subsequent decrease in suicides in the protective effect analysis.
Regression analyses
For multivariable logistic regression, Hosmer–Lemeshow tests 
showed good model fit (p < 0.05) for the protective effect regres-
sion model with all variables included and for the harmful effect 
model only if the continuous measure of number of articles was 
removed. Independent predictors in the harmful and protective 
effect models are shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. Ele-
ments significantly independently associated with increased sui-
cides in the harmful effect model were articles that contained a 
statement that suicide is inevitable (OR 1.97, CI 1.07–3.62); that 
were about asphyxia other than by car exhaust (OR 1.72, CI 1.36–
2.18), suicide by jumping from a building (OR 1.70, CI 1.28–2.26), 
suicide pacts (OR 1.63, CI 1.14–2.35), firearm suicide (OR 1.28, 
CI 1.08–1.51), or older adults (OR 1.25, CI 1.03–1.52); that included 
the suicide method in the headline (OR 1.41, CI 1.07–1.86); or that 
identified the deceased as a celebrity (OR 1.27, CI 1.08–1.49). Ele-
ments significantly independently associated with decreased sui-
cides in the protective effect model were unfavourable character-
istics (OR  0.54, CI 0.35–0.83), railway (OR 0.62, CI 0.42–0.91) and 
cutting or stabbing (OR 0.63, CI 0.47–0.84) deaths; individual 
 
murder-suicide (OR 0.67, CI 0.54–0.82); or articles about a specific 
person’s suicide or suicidality (OR 0.77, CI 0.66–0.89), public policy 
(OR 0.84, CI 0.72–0.97) and youth (OR 0.85, CI 0.75–0.96).
Sensitivity analyses stratifying by media type and publication 
era are presented in Appendices 3 and 4 (available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170698/-/DC1). Although these 
yielded some variability in elements that met the threshold for sta-
tistical significance, odds ratios were generally similar in direction 
and size between print and online articles, as well as 2011–2012 
and 2013–2014 articles. An exception was articles about jumping 
from a building, which in 2011–2012 were associated with 
increased suicides in the harmful effect analysis (OR 2.47, 95% CI 
1.71–3.57), but not in 2013–2014 (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51–1.34).
Interpretation
This study of the association between media reporting and suicide 
death found that several media item characteristics were associ-
ated with changes in suicides. Consistent with previous literature, 
articles about suicide in celebrities;4,12,16–20,32–35 by asphyxia other 
than by car exhaust (i.e., by plastic bag or helium gas, but not 
hanging or car exhaust)36–41 or by jumping;5,16 suicide pacts;21 and 
that included the method in the headline21 were each indepen-
dently associated with post-item increases in suicides. It is

particularly noteworthy that articles emphasizing the inevitability 
of suicide were associated with increased subsequent deaths.
Articles describing suicide in older adults were also positively 
associated with subsequent suicides. This may be because this 
popu 
lation is more likely to be exposed to and therefore influenced 
by newspaper reports.42,43 Older adults are also over-represented 
among suicide deaths, accounting for nearly twice as many as youth 
(see Table 1), which may make a media effect easier to detect.
Reporting of firearm suicides, among the methods with the 
highest lethality, was associated with increased subsequent sui-
cides, consistent with previous findings.36 Notably, although fire-
arm suicides account for less than 5% of all deaths in Toronto,31 
firearms were described as a method of suicide in 13% of articles. 
Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that novel methods of 
asphyxia, such as helium inhalation, may be particularly prone to 
contagion,37–41 and the results here would seem to support that.

In contrast, the protective effect model confirmed previous find-
ings that describing the suicide deceased negatively, via unfavourable 
characteristics or as the perpetrator of murder-suicide, was associ-
ated with fewer subsequent suicides.14 Cutting is a relatively low-
lethality method of suicide. Therefore, contagion may be less likely to 
result in death, and possibly more likely to result in injuries that lead 
to accessing care. Interviews with people who have attempted suicide 
show that some may be dissuaded by depictions of certain methods,44 
perhaps because they are painful or gruesome, which may explain the 
protective effects of reports about cutting and railway suicide.
The literature on media contagion of suicide in youth is mixed, 
with some studies supporting contagion21,45–49 and others showing 
a weaker association.11 The protective effect model showed that 
reports related to youth, as well as a specific person’s suicidality or 
suicide and public policy, were independently associated with 
fewer suicide deaths. We speculate that articles about each may be 
more likely to contain positive messages about awareness and 
change, which could mediate protective effects.
A difference between the findings of this study and previous 
research relates to suicidal ideation. The 2 large previous studies 
conducted in Austria and Australia found that articles about sui-
cidal ideation were negatively associated with subsequent sui-
cide,5,6 whereas no such relationship was seen here.
None of the putatively protective factors we measured were signifi-
cant even in bivariate comparisons. This may partially be a result of the 
low base rate of these elements overall, which appear in only 1%–4% 
of all articles, except for alternatives to suicide, such as seeking treat-
ment, which were included in 18.8% of articles. The 1 other large study 
that examined similar factors in an Austrian population generally had 
higher base rates of protective elements than those seen in the present 
Canadian study.5 Whether these elements may have an impact if they 
become more frequently used or whether there are any longer-term 
effects on suicide rates is beyond the scope of the present study.
Limitations
This study had several key advantages in that it examined both a 
large number of media articles (nearly 17 000 across 13 publica-
tions over 4 years) and suicide deaths within a geographically 
small area with a large population and a well-defined media mar-
ket. It also tested for both harmful and protective effects. This 
makes it one of the largest studies to date. 
However, it also has several limitations. The most important is that 
the study could not control how many people were actually exposed 
to the media items in question; nor could we control the level of expo-
sure. The broad circulation of these publications means we are able to 
assume that a large proportion of the entire population of Toronto 
was exposed. However, suicide is a highly complex phenomenon and 
because this is a large, uncontrolled experiment, we cannot rule out 
the possibility that the observed associations are a proxy for another 
kind of exposure. For example, we would expect newspaper reports of 
suicide to be frequently associated with television news reports or 
social media activity about the same stories that were not examined 
as part of this study. Therefore, the relative contribution of each of 
these exposures is unknown. Additionally, although stories that 
resulted in more articles were reflected in a larger sample size in the 
analysis, the study design did not identify or distinguish specific sui-
cide narratives or clusters of articles that may have had more impact. 
Media recommendations generally emphasize an itemized list of 
elements that should and should not be included in suicide-related 
reports.25–29 Accordingly, this study was designed to identify the

independent association of each specific element with suicides. This 
approach is scientifically valuable because it supports existing rec-
ommendations asserting that, for example, articles that include 
information about celebrity suicide or about suicide by firearm may 
be harmful irrespective of potentially harmful or protective ele-
ments within the same or other contemporaneous articles. How-
ever, a previous study has identified that certain overarching narra-
tive arcs of an article may have differing impacts,5 and the same may 
be the case for clusters of stories about a specific news 
event.4,12,14,16,20,21,32 This study design did not test either phenome-
non, both of which are relevant for future recommendations and 
should be the focus of further research in Canada. Moreover, the fact 
that sensitivity analyses that compared year of publication as well 
as print and online articles yielded subtle differences (Appendices 3 
and 4) underscores the importance of format as well as other con-
textual factors, not all of which could be controlled for, and some of 
which may have influenced the results of this study.
Furthermore, most suicides are detected by the Office of the 
Chief Coroner, but coroner data are imperfect. It is likely that at 
least 10% of suicide deaths went unrecognized or were misclassi-
fied as being a result of accident or natural causes.50
The study examined a single, large Canadian city, and a question 
remains about the degree to which these results can be generalized to 
other cities or regions. Likewise, it did not test whether non–suicide-
related articles had any association with suicide rates. Furthermore, 
this study examined the independent effects of specific media ele-
ments on suicide death, but it did not test for interactions between 
elements (e.g., whether having protective elements in an article might 
have attenuated the impact of harmful ones). Finally, this study exam-
ined only the impact of articles on deaths within 1 week of publica-
tion. We chose this method because it is the established standard in 
the literature5,6 and because it provides the best opportunity to 
observe a potential, acute cause-and-effect relationship. Nonetheless, 
it may be reasonable to postulate that media reporting could have an 
impact on suicide deaths months or even years later.51,52 Therefore, 
increases or decreases in suicides shown here may underestimate the 
full impact of these or other media reports. Likewise, it may be that 
some elements of the media reports do have effects on suicides, but 
that these effects are downstream and cannot be detected with this 
design. For example, it may be that putatively protective factors, such 
as messages of hope that suicidal thoughts can be overcome, do have 
a subsequent impact that is not detected within 1 week.
Finally, this study design did not address the question of 
whether different media reporting characteristics had differing 
effects on specific demographic groups. Overall associations are of 
much greater practical importance because journalists formulate 
their reporting for and disseminate it to the entire public. Never-
theless, investigating differences by subpopulation would add to 
our understanding and is an important avenue of further study.
Conclusion
Suicide is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by many factors, 
of which the media is only one. This large study augments an evolving 
literature showing that certain elements of media reports highlighted 
as harmful in Canadian guidelines are associated with increased sui-
cide deaths. The content of media reports — particularly those relat-
ing to celebrity suicide, suicide by asphyxia other than by car exhaust, 
suicide by jumping, suicide pacts and suicide in older adults — may 
lead to suicide contagion. However, most putatively protective factors 
had low base rates in the media we analyzed and were not associated 
with fewer deaths in the following week. Media reporting guidelines 
have been developed in Canada29 and elsewhere23–27 to help journal-
ists report respectfully and with attention to concerns about conta-
gion. Future guidelines should take into account these results and 
those from similar studies in order to provide journalists with the best 
available evidence on which to base their decisions. Finally, phys-
icians should be mindful of the importance of public messaging about 
suicide in their interactions with both journalists and patients.
