Abstract Cortical bone mass and density varies across a
bones length and cross section, and may be influenced by
physical activity. This study evaluated the long-term
effects of a pediatric school-based physical activity inter-
vention on tibial cortical bone mass distribution. A total of
170 children (72 girls and 98 boys) from one school were
provided with 200 min of physical education per week.
Three other schools (44 girls and 47 boys) continued with
the standard 60 min per week. Tibial total and cortical area,
cortical density, polar stress–strain index (SSI), and the
mass and density distribution around the center of mass
(polar distribution, mg) and through the bones cortex (ra-
dial distribution subdivided into endo-, mid-, and pericor-
tical volumetric BMD: mg/cm3) at three sites (14, 38, and
66 %) were assessed using peripheral quantitative com-
puted tomography after 7 years. Girls in the intervention
group had 2.5 % greater cortical thickness and 6.9 %
greater SSI at the 66 % tibia, which was accompanied by
significantly greater pericortical volumetric BMD com-
pared to controls (all P \ 0.05). Region-specific differ-
ences in cortical mass were also detected in the anterior,
medial, and lateral sectors at the 38 and 66 % tibial sites.
There were no group differences at the 14 % tibia site in
girls, and no group differences in any of the bone param-
eters in boys. Additional school-based physical education
over seven years was associated with greater tibial struc-
ture, strength, and region-specific adaptations in cortical
bone mass and density distribution in girls, but not in boys.

Introduction
Regular participation in moderate to high impact sports
(e.g., gymnastics, basketball, volleyball) during growth has
been associated with greater bone mass, structure, and
strength [1–3], traits associated with a reduced risk of
fracture [4]. There is also some evidence that these traits
can be improved through school-based physical activity
programs that incorporate targeted weight-bearing activi-
ties (e.g., jumping, hopping, skipping) [5–7], with the
greatest benefits apparent during the pre- and early pubertal
period [2, 7, 8]. However, there are few long-term inter-
vention studies [9, 10] examining the effects of more
generalized, school-based physical education (PE) pro-
grams on cortical bone structure and the mass/density
distribution during growth. This is important because
increased loading can induce small localized cortical bone
adaptations to resist fractures at sites subjected to the
greatest loads (strains) that are not necessarily detected
using techniques that simply measure whole cortical bone
mass or structure [11].
It is well established that the mass and density of cortical
bone varies across its cross section and along its axial length,
and that interindividual differences likely reflect adaptations
that occur in response to increased (or decreased) loading
[12, 13]. During growth, bone modeling is the primary factor
associated with exercise-induced changes in cortical bone

 geometry and mass distribution around the center of mass or
neutral axis (polar distribution) [14]. In contrast, any varia-
tion in cortical density and its circumferential distribution
(radial distribution) are likely to be related to changes in
intracortical remodeling that alter the porosity and/or min-
eralization of bone [15, 16]. While a number of cross-sec-
tional studies in children, adolescents, and young adults and
a longitudinal intervention by MacDonald et al. [10] have
reported that higher level of physical activity or participating
in high- or odd-impact sports or weight-bearing exercises is
associated with localized increases in cortical bone mass
(e.g., an increase in bone mass in the anterior-posterior
region of the tibia which is the primary direction of bending
in response to loading at the midtibial shaft) [10, 16–18], no
study has primarily investigated the effects of a long-term
school-based physical activity intervention on cortical bone
mass distribution.
This study is a secondary analysis of a 7-year school-
based PE intervention in which we have previously
reported that girls engaged in the intervention experienced
greater gains in total body and spine bone mineral density
(BMD) and had greater tibial cortical thickness at the 66 %
site, while no beneficial effects were detected in boys [7].
Building upon these findings, the aim of this study was to
evaluate the effects of the 7-year school-based PE inter-
vention on both polar cortical mass distribution and radial
volumetric BMD distribution along the tibial cortex in girls
and boys, since these effects may be present with or
without the effect on other bone parameters.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
The Malmo pediatric osteoporosis prevention (POP) study
is a prospective controlled physical activity intervention
study designed to examine the effects of increased school-
based PE on various health outcomes in Swedish children.
More specific details about the study design have been
reported previously [19, 20]. Briefly, four government-
funded elementary schools within the same geographic
area and with a similar socioeconomic and ethnic structure
agreed to participate. One of the schools was invited to be
the intervention school, while the remaining three served as
control schools. As previously reported [7], there was low
variability in various lifestyle, anthropometric, and bone
parameters between the schools.
Participants
Prior to any intervention, all children with a school start
year
in
1998–2000
in
the
intervention
school
and
1999–2000 in the control schools were invited to enroll in
the study. At the initial baseline testing, all children were
aged between 6 and 9 years. As reported previously [7, 19],
in the intervention group 94 of the 105 invited girls and 123
of the 132 invited boys agreed to participate. For the cur-
rent analyses involving the 7-year follow-up, we excluded
two girls and four boys in the intervention group due to
diseases or medications that could affect growth, bone
health, or muscle development. A further 20 girls and 19
boys were excluded due to incomplete baseline or follow-
up measurements and two more boys were excluded due to
poor image quality. In the control schools, a total of 64 of
the 157 invited girls and 68 of the 170 invited boys agreed
to participate in the study. For the current analyses, one girl
was excluded due to medication that could affect growth,
18 girls and 21 boys due to incomplete baseline or follow-
up measurements, and one girl due to poor image quality.
This resulted in a final cohort of 72 girls and 98 boys in the
intervention group and 44 girls and 47 boys in the control
group (Fig. 1). Dropout analyses demonstrated similar
baseline measurements in terms of age, height, and weight
between those children who only attended baseline and
those who also attended the 7-year follow-up (data not
shown). Also, there were no differences in anthropometric
characteristics (based on the first grade compulsory school
health examinations) for those who declined to participate
in the study and those who accepted [21].
Intervention
As reported previously [19, 20], PE is a compulsory school
subject in Sweden and children participate in 60 min per
week of PE. While the children in the three control schools
continued with the compulsory standard of 60 min per
week of PE, the amount of PE in the intervention school
was increased to 200 min per week which was adminis-
tered in a 40-min lesson every school day throughout the
7-year study period. All PE classes were conducted by the
regular teachers according to the regular PE curriculum and
included activities such as ball games, running, and
jumping. There were no extra PE classes during weekends
or school holidays.
Lifestyle, Health, and Physical Activity
Together with parents or guardians, the children answered
a questionnaire, previously used in several studies but
modified for use in children [22–24], to evaluate lifestyle
factors such as use of medications, diseases, nutrition,
smoking, menarche, and spare-time physical activity both
at baseline and at follow-up. Total physical activity was
calculated as regular organized spare-time PA plus school
curriculum

 maturation according to Tanner stage at the start of the
study and the children self-assessed tanner stage at follow-
up. Height and weight were measured using standard
equipment both at baseline and at follow-up.
Bone Mass, Structure, and Distribution
The main outcomes in this study, regional distribution of
bone mass and structure, were assessed only at follow-up.
We have previously reported cortical density, cortical
thickness, and total area for the 66 % tibial site [7]. Thus,
the regional distribution data in this study are cross-sec-
tional data, even though the POP study is commonly
referred to as a prospective controlled intervention study.
Cortical bone structure and density parameters, estimates
of bone strength, and regional body composition of the left
lower limb were assessed using peripheral quantitative
computed
tomography
(pQCT,
XCT
2000�,
Stratec,
Pforzheim, Germany). For all participants, a left leg scout
scan was performed to determine the 14, 38, and 66 % of
the tibia length from the distal end of the medial malleolus,
after which each site was scanned. The voxel size was set
to 0.5 mm, the slice thickness to 2 mm, and the scanning
speed to 20 mm/s. The manufacturer’s software package
(Stratec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany, version 6) in con-
junction with edge detection and thresholding steps was
used to acquire densitometric and structural parameters of
bone and soft tissue. The periosteal surface of the tibia
diaphysis was found by using a contour algorithm based on
a threshold of 280 mg/cm3 from which total bone area
(mm2) was estimated. The polar SSI (mm3) was derived to
estimate diaphyseal bone resistance to torsional loading
[25]. As reported previously [16], cortical bone was
selected by thresholding at 550 mg/cm3 for the 14 % site
and 710 mg/cm3 for the 38 and 66 % sites, from which
cortical area (mm2), cortical density (mg/cm3), and cortical
thickness (mm) were derived. Subcutaneous fat cross-sec-
tional area (CSA, cm2) was obtained by selecting the area
with thresholds -40–40 mg/cm3 hydroxyapatite density.
Muscle CSA (cm2) was obtained by subtracting fat CSA
and total bone area from the CSA of the total limb. The
coefficient of variation (CV %), evaluated by duplicate
measurements in our lab in 13 healthy children, was 0.5 %
for cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD).
Polar distribution (cortical bone mineral mass, mg) and
radial distribution (radial vBMD, mg/cm3) of the tibia were
estimated using Image J as described previously [11].
Briefly, a threshold of 550 mg/cm3 for the 14 % site and
710 mg/cm3 for the 38 and 66 % sites with a 3 9 3 median
filtering of the image was used to differentiate the cortical
bone from the surrounding soft tissue and bone marrow. To
eliminate partial volume effects, the outermost and inner-
most layers of cortical pixels were excluded from the
analysis. We aligned the bones between individuals

 according to tibia and fibula marrow center and calculated
polar distribution by subdividing the tibia cortex into six
sectors around its center of mass with the average bone
mass estimated for each sector (Fig. 2a). Radial distribu-
tion was estimated by subdividing the cortex into three
concentric rings (endocortical, midcortical, and pericorti-
cal) by first removing all pixels below the threshold of each
site from the image and subdividing the remaining cortical
bone into three concentric circles with the same thickness.
The thickness of the rings varied around the cortex
according to the anatomy. The innermost ring is referred to
as endocortical, the midring as midcortical, and the
outermost ring as the pericortical (Fig. 2b).
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS
Statistics� version 20. Results are reported as absolute
numbers, means with standard deviations (SD), or means
with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI), unless otherwise
stated. We tested group differences by Student’s t test
between means, Fisher’s exact test, Pearson’s Chi-square
test, or Mann–Whitney U-test. For bone distribution
parameter comparisons between groups at follow-up, we
used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for age
at baseline. In a second model, we used ANCOVA adjusted
for age at baseline, Tanner stage at follow-up, weight at
follow-up, and tibial length at follow-up. P \ 0.05 was
regarded as statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics of boys and girls in intervention and control
groups are shown in Table 1. At baseline, girls and boys in
the control groups were on average 0.3 years older than
their intervention counterparts, and a higher proportion of
boys in the intervention group excluded dairy products
from their diet compared to controls (Table 1). At follow-
up, girls in the intervention group had longer tibia and a
larger proportion indicated some form of medical condition
compared to controls, while boys in the intervention group
had smaller muscle CSA at the tibial 38 % site than male
controls (Table 1).
Prior to the intervention, the amount of organized
physical activity was similar in each of the gender-specific
intervention groups and their respective controls. In con-
trast, after the initiation of the intervention and during the
entire 7-year study period, the total amount of physical
activity was on average 1.9–3.2 h per week higher in the
girls and 2.0–3.1 h per week higher in the boys in the
intervention compared to the control group (Table 2).
As previously reported, girls in the intervention group
had greater cortical thickness at the 66 % tibia at the 7-year
follow-up [7]. At the 7-year follow-up, girls in the inter-
vention group also had greater SSI at the 66 % tibia
compared to controls (P \ 0.05), which was accompanied
by greater mineral mass in the lateral [?0.6 mg (95 % CI
0.2, 1.0)], anterior-medial [?1.1 mg (0.4, 1.9)], and medial
[?0.6 mg (0.2, 0.9)] sectors and greater radial vBMD in
the pericortical region [?11.1 mg/cm3 (0.2, 22.0)] com-
pared to controls (P ranging from\
0.05 to\
0.001). At the
38 % tibia site, bone mass distribution analysis revealed
that girls in the intervention group had significantly greater
mineral mass in the lateral [?0.6 mg (0.3, 1.0)], anterior-
medial [?0.8 mg (0.3, 1.4)], and medial [?0.4 mg (0.1,
0.8)] sectors compared to controls (P ranging from\
0.05 to
\
0.001). When expressed as a percentage difference rel-
ative to controls, the adjusted differences in favor of the
intervention group was 6.9 % for SSI at the 66 % tibia,
7.7–11.7 % for mineral mass across the various sectors at
each site, and 0.7 % for the pericortical vBMD at the 66 %
tibia. There were no significant differences at the 14 % site
in girls, and no skeletal differences in boys between the
groups at any site (14, 38, or 66 %) (Table 3; Fig. 3).
Using the second adjustment model, adjusting for age at

 baseline and Tanner stage, weight and tibial length at fol-
low-up, the results remained largely unchanged, with the
exception that the benefits of the intervention in girls at the
anterior-medial sector (P = 0.06) and the medial sector
(P = 0.12) at the 38 % tibial site were no longer
significant.

 group had greater cortical strength at the 66 % and to a
lesser extent the 38 % tibia, which was accompanied by
small but significant region-specific bone mass adaptations
in the anterior, lateral, and anterior-medial cortices and an
increase in pericortical volumetric BMD at the 66 % site.
There was no effect of the intervention at the 14 % tibia
site. These results suggest that a generalized, moderate-
intensity
school-based
physical
activity
program
can
enhance bone structure and induce region-specific cortical
bone adaptations throughout the tibia in girls.
While there are reports that exercise during the pre- and
peripubertal years can enhance bone mass, structure, and
strength at loaded skeletal sites [5, 26], there are mixed
findings from the limited number of school-based exercise
intervention studies that have used pQCT to evaluate
exercise-induced changes in bone structure and strength
[9, 10, 27–30]. This may be related, at least in part, to the
relatively short follow-up periods (8–16 months) in many
of these studies, which may have limited the ability to
detect subtle early exercise-induced bone structural chan-
ges over and above those associated with normal growth. A
4-year school-based, specialist-led PE intervention study in
prepubertal boys and girls reported that girls receiving two
50-minute sessions of specialist-led PE per week had
5.0–7.5 % greater gains in tibia 66 % cortical area and
thickness compared to girls receiving common practice PE;
boys receiving the specialist PE also had greater gains
(5.2 %) in cortical thickness [27]. Consistent with these
findings, the results from our 7-year population-based
school PE intervention showed that girls receiving the
intervention had 6.9 % greater cortical strength (SSI) at the
66 % tibia compared to controls. In boys, however, we
found no positive skeletal benefits of the extra PE, which
could be due to the gender difference in activity level with
boys being more active than girls in our study, and thus less
likely to experience further skeletal adaptation with the
additional PE. Although cause-and-effect cannot be infer-
red from our study because pQCT measures of bone
structure and strength were not assessed at baseline, the
results provide some additional evidence that long-term
school-based physical activity interventions can induce
cortical bone structural changes during the pre- and
peripubertal years, especially in girls.
A novel finding from our study was that the moderate-
intensity school-based PE intervention was associated with
region-specific cortical bone adaptations at various sites
along the tibia. Specifically, we found that girls receiving
the intervention had 7.7–11.7 % higher mineral mass at the
lateral, anterior, and anterior-medial sectors of both the 38
and 66 % tibial sites. The results from a previous 16-month
school-based physical activity intervention in boys also
reported that the enhanced tibial bone strength associated
the intervention was predominantly due to greater cortical
area/thickness gains in the anterior, medial, and posterior
quadrants of the midtibia [10]. However, in that study the
between-group differences were modest (1.0–1.4 %) and
not significantly different from the growth-related changes
in the controls, which may be explained by the relatively
short intervention period. Nevertheless, several previous
cross-sectional studies in children and adolescents [16, 18]

 and young athletes [17] have reported that higher levels of
weight-bearing impact activities or sports were associated
with localized cortical adaptations, particularly in the
anterior-posterior plane of the mid- and proximal tibia.
This is in line with other evidence that suggest that the
midtibial shafts primary loading mode is bending in ante-
rior-posterior plane [31]. However, the result in our study
that there were also region-specific adaptations in the
medial and lateral planes might be explained by the fact
that our generalized PE intervention included a wide range
of activities, such as ball games, running, jumping, and
playing, that could have created bending forces in the
medial and lateral planes of the tibia.
An interesting result in our study was that there were no
exercise-induced cortical bone adaptations at the 14 %
tibia. Previous unilateral loading studies in young tennis
players have found that the response of cortical bone to
loading is site (and surface) specific [32, 33]. It is possible
that these findings may relate to the hypothesis that the
strain threshold for bone adaptation may vary within (and
between) bones depending on the local strain environment
[34, 35]. For example, a study of rat ulna found that the
strain threshold to induce an osteogenic response varied
along the length of the bone, with the greatest response
occurring distally where strains are typically higher com-
pared to proximally [34]. In our study, we did not observe
any region-specific cortical bone adaptations more distally
(14 % tibia) which may be explained by the fact that this
site experiences predominantly compressive loads (strains)
which may be more uniformly distributed throughout the
cortex, and thus less likely to stimulate localized bone
(periosteal) adaptations [36].
Several previous cross-sectional studies in children
[16, 18] and young athletes [17, 37] as well as school-based
physical activity interventions [9, 27–29] have reported no
change, an increase or a decrease with regard to the effects
of physical activity or weight-bearing impact exercise on
pQCT-derived measures of cortical vBMD at the tibia. In
our study, we observed no effects of the intervention on
whole bone tibial cortical vBMD or radial density distri-
bution, in which we subdivided the tibia into inner, mid-,
and outer circumferential layers, with exception of a small
0.7 % higher pericortical vBMD in girls in the intervention
compared to control group. Since the assessment of cortical
vBMD represents an apparent mineral density that reflects
a combination of intracortical porosity, mineralization, and
other bone material properties [38], this may suggest that
our moderate-intensity school-based PE intervention had
no effect on the porosity and/or mineralization of cortical
bone along the shaft of the tibia.
Consistent with the findings from our study, previous
school-based intervention studies have reported mixed
findings regarding the effects of physical activity on
pQCT-measured bone parameters in boys compared to girls
[9, 27, 28]. The finding that there was no effect of the
intervention on any bone parameters among boys in our
study could be due to the fact that the girls were generally
less active in their spare-time prior to the commencement
of the study, and thus the extra school-based physical
activity which included a diverse range of weight-bearing
activities was sufficient to elicit positive skeletal adapta-
tions. Indeed, boys in our study were already undertaking a
mean of[
3 h per week of physical activity prior to the start
of the intervention, and hence, the additional physical
activity was not enough to elicit further bone adaptation.
Although the
optimal
dose
of
physical
activity
for
enhancing bone health during growth remains unknown,
there is some evidence that duration of activity is a strong
predictor of bone structure and estimates of bone strength
at the tibia in children aged 8–13 years [39]. Furthermore,
since maturational stage differs from chronological age
between genders [40], even if the girls and boys are the

 same age and Tanner stage, they might be in different
maturational stages when it comes to bone development
and that could explain the gender difference in outcome.
The strengths of this study include the population-based
design, the general school-based PE program which was at
a level enabling all children to participate, the long-term
intervention (this is the longest of its kind), and the unique
technique used to quantify cortical mass and density dis-
tribution. However, there are a number of limitations. The
single pQCT assessment, which is inherently vulnerable to
uncontrolled factors such as
reverse
causality, is a
limitation. Nevertheless, the primary findings in this study
were independent of age, Tanner stage, bone length, and
weight, which increase the likelihood that the intervention
contributed to the positive skeletal adaptation rather than
selection bias based on body size. Another limitation is that
self-assessment in tanner staging has by some researcher
been recognized as a less reliable indicator for maturity
[41, 42] while others have inferred that this estimate is
useful when evaluating maturity in children on group level
[43, 44]. It would also have been advantageous to register
participation rates and activity levels during each physical

 education (PE) class to better estimate overall activity
levels, and include objective measures of physical activity
(e.g., accelerometers) to quantify the level of loading
associated with the school PE program. However, PE is a
compulsory school subject in Sweden and none of the
participating children failed their grade.
In conclusion, this study indicates that a 7-year moder-
ately intense school-based physical activity intervention
initiated in the prepubertal period was associated with
higher tibial cortical bone strength that was accompanied
by region-specific gains in cortical bone mass distribution
in girls, but not in boys.
