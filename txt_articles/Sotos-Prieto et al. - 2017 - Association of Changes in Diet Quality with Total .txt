Abstract
BACKGROUND—Few studies have evaluated the relationship between changes in diet quality 
over time and the risk of death.
METHODS—We used Cox proportional-hazards models to calculate adjusted hazard ratios for 
total and cause-specific mortality among 47,994 women in the Nurses’ Health Study and 25,745 
men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study from 1998 through 2010. Changes in diet quality 
over the preceding 12 years (1986–1998) were assessed with the use of the Alternate Healthy 
Eating Index–2010 score, the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score, and the Dietary Approaches to 
Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score.
RESULTS—The pooled hazard ratios for all-cause mortality among participants who had the 
greatest improvement in diet quality (13 to 33% improvement), as compared with those who had a 
relatively stable diet quality (0 to 3% improvement), in the 12-year period were the following: 0.91 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 0.97) according to changes in the Alternate Healthy Eating 
Index score, 0.84 (95 CI%, 0.78 to 0.91) according to changes in the Alternate Mediterranean Diet 
score, and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.95) according to changes in the DASH score. A 20-percentile 
increase in diet scores (indicating an improved quality of diet) was significantly associated with a 
reduction in total mortality of 8 to 17% with the use of the three diet indexes and a 7 to 15% 
reduction in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease with the use of the Alternate Healthy 
Eating Index and Alternate Mediterranean Diet. Among participants who maintained a high-

 quality diet over a 12-year period, the risk of death from any cause was significantly lower — by 
14% (95% CI, 8 to 19) when assessed with the Alternate Healthy Eating Index score, 11% (95% 
CI, 5 to 18) when assessed with the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score, and 9% (95% CI, 2 to 15) 
when assessed with the DASH score — than the risk among participants with consistently low diet 
scores over time.
CONCLUSIONS—Improved diet quality over 12 years was consistently associated with a 
decreased risk of death.
Some epidemiologic studies of nutrition focus on dietary patterns rather than single nutrients 
or foods to evaluate the association between diet and health outcomes.1 Accumulated 
evidence supports an association between healthy dietary patterns and a decreased risk of 
death.2–11 Results from recent studies suggest that improved diet quality, as assessed by 
means of the Alternate Healthy Eating Index–2010 score,12 the Alternate Mediterranean 
Diet score,10,13 and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score,14 was 
associated with reductions of 8% to 22% in the risk of death from any cause15,16 and 
reductions of 19% to 28% in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and 11% to 23% 
in the risk of death from cancer.2–4,17
Given such consistent evidence, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended 
the Alternate Healthy Eating Index, the Alternate Mediterranean Diet, and DASH as 
practical, understandable, and actionable diet plans for the public.18 Such guidelines are 
important in the United States and globally because unhealthy diets have been ranked as a 
major factor contributing to death and health complications.19 Evaluation of changes in diet 
quality over time in relation to the subsequent risk of death would be important. Here, we 
evaluated the association between 12-year changes (from 1986 through 1998) in the three 
diet-quality scores noted above and the subsequent risk of total and cause-specific death 
from 1998 through 2010 among participants in the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health 
Professionals Follow-up Study. We also examined short-term changes (baseline to 8-year 
follow-up, 1986–1994) and long-term changes (baseline to 16-year follow-up, 1986–2002) 
in diet quality in relation to total and cause-specific mortality.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION AND DESIGN
The Nurses’ Health Study, a prospective study that was initiated in 1976, enrolled 121,700 
registered nurses who were 30 to 55 years of age. The Health Professionals Follow-up 
Study, a prospective study that was initiated in 1986, enrolled 51,529 U.S. health 
professionals who were 40 to 75 years of age. Baseline and follow-up questionnaires were 
sent to participants every 2 years to update medical and lifestyle information over the 
follow-up period.20,21 In both studies, follow-up rates exceeded 90% in both cohorts.22
For the present study, the initial cycle was set at 1986, baseline was set at 1998 (changes in 
diet quality were calculated from 1986 through 1998), and the end of follow-up was 2010. 
We excluded participants who had a history of cardiovascular disease or cancer at or before 
baseline in 1998, missing information regarding diet and lifestyle covariates, or very low or 
high caloric intake (<800 kcal or >4200 kcal per day in men and <500 or >3500 kcal per day

47,994 women and 25,745 men.

DIETARY ASSESSMENT
At baseline and every 4 years thereafter, the participants reported information about their 
diets with the use of a validated food frequency questionnaire. They were asked how often, 
on average, they had consumed each food of a standard portion size in the past year. The 
reproducibility and validity of the food frequency questionnaires have been described 
previously.12,23,24
We calculated three diet-quality scores using food components and scoring criteria that have 
been described previously.25 Briefly, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index included 11 food 
components, each scored from 0 (unhealthy) to 10 (healthiest) and selected on the basis of 
evidence of an association with the risk of chronic disease.12 Total scores ranged from 0 to 
110, with higher scores indicating a healthier diet. The Alternate Mediterranean Diet score 
included 9 components, each scored as 0 (unhealthy) or 1 (healthy) according to whether the 
participant’s intake was above or below the cohort-specific median levels.10,13 Total scores 
ranged from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a healthier diet. Finally, the DASH score 
included 8 components, each scored from 1 (unhealthy) to 5 (healthiest) according to a 
participant’s quintile of intake.14 Total DASH scores ranged from 8 to 40 points, with higher 
scores indicating a healthier diet. Further information is provided in Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
ASCERTAINMENT OF DEATHS
Deaths were identified from state vital statistics records and the National Death Index or 
reported by the participants’ families and the U.S. postal system.26 Using these methods, we 
could ascertain 98% of the deaths in each cohort.26 We attempted to obtain the death 
certificate of each participant who had died, and when appropriate, we requested permission 
from the participant’s next of kin to review medical records. The underlying cause of death, 
according to the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision and Ninth 
Revision, was assigned by physicians after they had reviewed death certificates and medical 
records.

 COVARIATES
Information on the participants’ lifestyle and risk factors for cardiovascular disease was 
assessed and updated every other year. This information included the following: the 
participant’s age; weight; smoking status; use of aspirin, multivitamins, postmenopausal 
hormone-replacement therapy, and oral contraceptives; menopausal status; physical activity; 
and hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes that had been recently diagnosed by a 
physician. Alcohol use was assessed, and this information was updated from the food 
frequency questionnaires every 4 years. The participant’s height and weight were used to 
calculate the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the 
height in meters). Detailed descriptions of the validity and reproducibility of body weight, 
physical activity, and alcohol consumption as reported by the participants have been 
published previously.27–29
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Changes in the three diet-quality scores were categorized into quintiles from the largest 
decrease (quintile 1) to the largest increase (quintile 5). Person-years were calculated from 
the date of return of the 1998 questionnaire to the date of death or the end of follow-up, 
whichever occurred first. Cox proportional-hazards models with time-varying covariates and 
age as the underlying time scale were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals.
Model 1 was adjusted for the following factors: age; calendar year as the underlying time 
scale; initial diet-quality score (in quintiles); race; family history of myocardial infarction, 
diabetes, or cancer; use or nonuse of aspirin or multivitamins; initial BMI category; 
menopausal status and use or nonuse of hormone-replacement therapy in women; initial 
smoking status and changes in smoking status; initial smoking pack-year and changes in 
smoking pack-year (continuous variables) among participants with any history of smoking 
(ever smokers); and initial levels of physical activity and total energy intake and changes in 
these levels (in quintiles). In addition to these adjustments, model 2 was adjusted for a 
history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or type 2 diabetes; change in weight; and the 
use or nonuse of cholesterol-lowering and antihypertensive medications. The model with the 
DASH score as the exposure was also adjusted for initial alcohol intake and changes in 
alcohol intake. Tests for trend were conducted by assigning a median value to each quintile. 
A 20-percentile increase in each score was calculated from the range of the diet score and 
the median value of each quintile. We also conducted restricted-cubic-spline regressions to 
flexibly model the association.
Shorter-term changes (baseline to 8-year follow-up, 1986–1994) and longer-term changes 
(baseline to 16-year follow-up, 1986–2002) in the three scores were tested for association 
with total and cause-specific mortality. We conducted several sensitivity analyses to test the 
robustness of our findings. First, we applied stratification analysis according to several 
potential confounding factors at baseline (e.g., age, BMI, diet, physical activity, and smoking 
status). Second, we conducted a 4-year lag analysis to account for the presence of any 
chronic diseases in the years after diagnosis that might have influenced dietary patterns. 
Third, because early detection and treatment of disease could confound results, in an

 additional model we adjusted for mammographic screening in women and physical 
checkups.
All analyses were performed separately for each cohort and then were pooled with the use of 
an inverse, variance-weighted meta-analysis with a fixed-effects model. Analyses were 
performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 for UNIX (SAS Institute). Statistical 
tests were two-sided, and P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical 
significance.
RESULTS
LIFESTYLE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICIPANTS
Initial lifestyle characteristics and changes in these characteristics according to quintiles of 
change in the Alternate Healthy Eating Index score over 12 years are shown in Table 1. In 
both cohorts, participants with a greater increase in diet quality were younger, had a lower 
baseline diet score, engaged in more physical activity, and consumed less alcohol than 
participants with little change in diet quality. Participants with a greater increase in diet 
quality reported increased consumption of whole grains, vegetables, and n-3 fatty acids and 
decreased sodium intake over time (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Similar 
patterns were observed with assessments based on the Alternate Mediterranean Diet and 
DASH scores (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). In general, participants with 
consistently high diet quality at baseline and 12 years later were older, had a lower BMI, 
were less likely to be current smokers, and were more physically active than those with a 
poor diet quality both at baseline and 12 years later (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
In the Nurses’ Health Study, we documented 5967 deaths, including 1115 deaths from 
cardiovascular disease and 2089 deaths from cancer over 544,973 person-years of follow-up. 
In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we documented 3979 deaths, including 1226 
deaths from cardiovascular disease and 1192 deaths from cancer during 286,402 person-
years of follow-up.
TOTAL MORTALITY AND DIET QUALITY
Multivariable analyses showed a significant inverse association across quintiles of change 
over 12 years between each of the three diet-quality scores and total mortality (P<0.05 for 
trend) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The pooled hazard ratios among 
participants with the greatest improvement in diet quality (13 to 33% improvement), as 
compared with those whose diet quality remained relatively stable (0 to 3% improvement) in 
the 12-year period, were the following: 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 0.97) 
according to changes in the Alternate Healthy Eating Index score; 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78 to 
0.91) according to changes in the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score; and 0.89 (95% CI, 
0.84 to 0.95) according to changes in the DASH score (Table 2). In contrast, a decrease in 
diet quality, as compared with no change in diet quality, was associated with increased total 
mortality (pooled hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.19) when assessed with the Alternate 
Healthy Eating Index score, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.13) when assessed with the Alternate

 Mediterranean Diet score, and 1.06 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.12) when assessed with the DASH 
score. Restricted-cubic-spline analyses showed no evidence of nonlinearity in women (P = 
0.005 for linearity) and men (P<0.001 for linearity) (Fig. S1A and S1B in the Supplementary 
Appendix), and for the other two dietary indexes (data not shown).
DIET SCORES AND REDUCTION IN MORTALITY
In continuous analyses, a 20-percentile increase in diet-quality scores was associated with a 
reduction of 8 to 17% in the risk of death from any cause (Table 3, and Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). A 20-percentile increase in the Alternate Healthy Eating Index 
and Alternate Mediterranean Diet scores, but not the DASH score, was associated with a 
significantly reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease (pooled hazard ratio, 0.85; 
95% CI, 0.76 to 0.96) when assessed with the Alternate Healthy Eating Index score; 0.93 
(95% CI, 0.88 to 0.99) when assessed with the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score, and 0.96 
(95% CI, 0.88 to 1.05) when assessed with the DASH score. A significant inverse 
association between diet quality and the risk of death from cancer was seen only when the 
DASH score was used (0.91; 95% CI, 0.84 to 0.98) (Table 3); this was attributable mainly to 
a decreased risk of death from lung cancer (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
As compared with participants who had consistently low diet scores over time, those with 
the poorest score at baseline but the largest improvements 12 years later had a 15% (95% CI, 
3 to 25) lower risk of death from any cause when diet quality was assessed with the 
Alternate Healthy Eating Index score, 23% (95% CI, 12 to 32) when assessed with the 
Alternate Mediterranean Diet score, and 28% (95% CI, 16 to 38) when assessed with the 
DASH score (Fig. 1). Those who had consistently high diet scores over time had a 14% 
(95% CI, 8 to 19) lower risk of death from any cause according to the Alternate Healthy 
Eating Index score, 11% (95% CI, 5 to 18) according to the Alternate Mediterranean Diet 
score, and 9% (95% CI, 2 to 15) according to the DASH score (Fig. 1, and Table S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). We did not observe consistent evidence to support an association 
between improvement in diet-quality scores and a decreased risk of death from cancer (Table 
S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
TIMING OF DIETARY CHANGES
In multivariable analysis, a 20-percentile increase during the first 8, 12, and 16 years in any 
of the three diet scores was significantly associated with a reduced risk of death from any 
cause (Fig. 2). Associations were strengthened when changes over a longer duration were 
evaluated. For example, a 20-percentile increase in the Alternate Healthy Eating Index score 
over 8 years was associated with a reduction in mortality of 11% (95% CI, 6 to 15), whereas 
among participants with the same degree of improvement over 16 years, the reduction in 
mortality was 26% (95% CI, 21 to 31) (Tables S8 and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
A 20-percentile increase over 16 years in any of the three diet scores was significantly 
associated with a decreased risk of death from cardiovascular disease (Table S10 and Fig. 
S2A in the Supplementary Appendix). Neither short-term nor long-term changes in dietary 
patterns were associated with a decreased risk of death from cancer (Fig. S2B in the 
Supplementary Appendix).

 SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
In sensitivity analyses, the significant inverse association between changes in the three 
scores and total and cause-specific mortality remained similar when we further adjusted for 
mammographic screening (in women only) and physical checkups (Table S11 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), when we stratified the analyses according to major confounding 
factors (Table S12 in the Supplementary Appendix), when we added a 4-year lag period 
after changes in diet-quality scores (Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix), when 
alcohol was removed from the Alternate Healthy Eating Index score and the Alternate 
Mediterranean Diet score (Table S14 in the Supplementary Appendix), or when smoking 
duration and dose instead of smoking pack-years were adjusted in the multivariable models 
(Table S15 in the Supplementary Appendix).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we found consistent associations between improved diet quality over 12 
years as assessed by the Alternate Healthy Eating Index, Alternate Mediterranean Diet, and 
DASH scores and a reduced risk of death in the subsequent 12 years. A 20-percentile 
increase in diet-quality scores was associated with an 8 to 17% reduction in mortality. In 
contrast, worsening diet quality over 12 years was associated with an increase in mortality of 
6 to 12%. The risk of death from any cause was significantly lower (by 9 to 14%) among 
participants who maintained a high-quality diet than among those who had consistently low 
diet scores over time.
Our results are consistent with those of recent meta-analyses showing that higher diet-
quality scores measured with the Alternate Healthy Eating Index, Alternate Mediterranean 
Diet, DASH, and the Healthy Eating Index–2010 were associated with a 17 to 26% 
reduction in the risk of death from any cause.15,16 We found a dose-dependent relationship 
between changes in diet quality over 12 years and total mortality. These results underscore 
the concept that moderate improvements in diet quality over time could meaningfully 
decrease the risk of death, and conversely, worsening diet quality may increase the risk. The 
change in the risk of death was more pronounced when longer-term (16 years) rather than 
shorter-term (8 years) changes in diet quality were considered.
Taken together, our findings provide support for the recommendations of the 2015 Dietary 
Guidelines Advisory Committee that it is not necessary to conform to a single diet plan to 
achieve healthy eating patterns.18 These three dietary patterns, although different in 
description and composition, capture the essential elements of a healthy diet. Common food 
groups in each score that contributed most to improvements were whole grains, vegetables, 
fruits, and fish or n-3 fatty acids.
To improve our comparison of associations between the three scores that differ in scoring 
criteria and range, we evaluated the association with mortality using a 20-percentile increase 
in each score as a common unit for improving diet. For example, if we assume a causal 
relationship, a person with an increase of 22 of 110 points in the Alternate Healthy Eating 
Index score over a 12-year period could reduce his or her risk of death by nearly 20% in the 
subsequent 12 years. An increase in consumption of nuts and legumes from no servings to 1

 serving per day and a reduction in consumption of red and processed meats from 1.5 
servings per day to little consumption will result in an improvement of 20 points in the 
score. These findings are broadly consistent with those of previous meta-analyses of the 
association between consumption of nuts30 and red meat31 and mortality.
In line with other studies, stronger associations were seen when overall deaths and deaths 
from cardiovascular causes were analyzed, and null or weaker associations were observed 
for death from cancer.2,3,8,12,32 Our results with respect to improvement in the Alternate 
Healthy Eating Index and a reduction in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease were 
expected, given that the Alternate Healthy Eating Index is based on current knowledge of 
dietary factors contributing to cardiovascular disease.12 Evidence supports the inverse 
association between higher scores in the Alternate Healthy Eating Index2–4,6,8,16 or the 
Mediterranean-style diet10,11,13,32–34 and a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease 
in various populations. We did not find significant associations between changes in the 
DASH score and death from cardiovascular causes. Although the DASH score shares some 
food and nutrient components with the two other scores, it does not include fish or specific 
fatty acids, which have been consistently associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular 
disease.21,33 In addition, previous findings have shown that moderate alcohol intake is 
associated with a reduction in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease,21,35 and this 
component is not included in the DASH score. Although some studies have shown a 
significantly reduced risk of death from cancer with good adherence to some dietary 
patterns,4–6 other studies have not shown such associations.2,8,32 Our study did not provide 
consistent evidence that improving diet quality had a substantial effect on overall mortality 
from cancer.
The strengths of our study include the prospective design, large sample sizes, high rates of 
follow-up, repeated assessment of diet and lifestyle, and use of multiple diet-quality scores. 
However, the study has certain limitations. Because dietary data were reported by the 
participants, measurement errors were inevitable. However, our food frequency 
questionnaires were extensively validated against diet records and biomarkers. Although we 
were able to adjust for many potential confounders, residual and unmeasured confounding 
could not be completely ruled out. We did not examine the association of each component of 
the scores and mortality because we considered that a high diet quality is a combination of 
multiple components that act synergistically. Finally, generalizability may be limited 
because participants were mostly white health professionals and we only included one third 
of the initial population because of our study design. However, our findings are broadly 
consistent with those from other populations.
In conclusion, among U.S. adults, we observed consistent associations between increasing 
diet quality over 12 years and a reduced risk of death.

 Figure 1. Risk of Death from Any Cause, According to Scores on Three Measures of Diet Quality 
at Baseline and 12 Years Later
The multivariable-adjusted risk of death from any cause according to the Alternate Healthy 
Eating Index–2010 score (Panel A), the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score (Panel B), and 
the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score (Panel C) at baseline and 12 
years later is shown. Baseline scores are shown as low, medium, and high, with higher 
scores indicating a healthier diet. At 12 years, a participant may have had a consistently low 
score over time, a change from a low score to a medium or high score, a consistently 
medium score over time, a change from a medium score to a low or high score, a 
consistently high score over time, or a change from a high score to a low or medium score.

 Figure 2. Risk of Death from Any Cause per 20-Percentile Increase in Diet-Quality Scores
The multivariable-adjusted risk of death from any cause per 20-percentile increase in the 
score (indicating improvement in the quality of the diet) on three measures of diet quality is 
shown. The 20-percentile increase in each score was calculated from the median value of 
each quintile. I bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

*The multivariable-adjusted model 1 was adjusted for age; initial diet-quality score (in quintiles); race (white vs. nonwhite); family history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or cancer; use or nonuse of 
aspirin or multivitamins; initial BMI (<23.0, 23.0 to 24.9, 25.0 to 29.9, 30.0 to 34.9, and =35.0); initial smoking status and changes in smoking status; initial smoking pack-years and changes in smoking 
pack-years (continuous variable) among participants with any history of smoking (ever smokers); initial levels of physical activity and total energy intake and changes in these levels (all in quintiles); and 
menopausal status and use or nonuse of hormone-replacement therapy in women. The multivariable-adjusted model 2 had the same adjustments as model 1 plus history of hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia, or type 2 diabetes (all yes vs. no); weight change (in quintiles); and use or nonuse of cholesterol-lowering and antihypertensive medications. The Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension (DASH) score models were also adjusted for initial intake of alcohol and change in this intake (in quintiles). Results from the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-up 
Study (HPFS) were combined with the use of the fixed-effects model. CI denotes confidence interval.
