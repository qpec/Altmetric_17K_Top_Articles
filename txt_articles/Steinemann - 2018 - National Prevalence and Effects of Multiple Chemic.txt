 National Prevalence and Effects of Multiple Chemical Sensitivities
Anne Steinemann, PhD
Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of multiple
chemical sensitivities (MCS), its co-occurrence with asthma and fragrance
sensitivity, and effects from exposure to fragranced consumer products.
Methods: A
nationally
representative
cross-sectional
population-
based sample of adult Americans (n ¼ 1137) was surveyed in June 2016.
Results: Among the population, 12.8% report medically diagnosed MCS
and 25.9% report chemical sensitivity. Of those with MCS, 86.2% experience
health problems, such as migraine headaches, when exposed to fragranced
consumer products; 71.0% are asthmatic; 70.3% cannot access places that
use fragranced products such as air fresheners; and 60.7% lost workdays
or a job in the past year due to fragranced products in the workplace.
Conclusion: Prevalence of diagnosed MCS has increased over 300%, and
self-reported chemical sensitivity over 200%, in the past decade. Reducing
exposure to fragranced products could help reduce adverse health and
societal effects.

BACKGROUND
M
ultiple chemical sensitivities (MCS) is a medical condition
characterized by adverse health effects from exposure to
common chemicals and pollutants, from products such as pesticides,
new carpet and paint, renovation materials, diesel exhaust, cleaning
supplies, perfume, scented laundry products, and air fresheners.1,2
MCS can cause a range of acute, chronic, multiorgan, and disabling
health effects, such as headaches, dizziness, cognitive impairment,
breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, nausea, mucous membrane
irritation, and asthma attacks.3 Individuals with MCS may not
receive a diagnosis but nonetheless exhibit the condition of chemi-
cal sensitivity. Previous studies have found that MCS often co-
occurs with asthma,4 as well as fragrance sensitivity,5 characterized
by adverse health effects from exposure to fragranced consumer
products.6
While MCS is perhaps the most common term, the condition
is also known by other terms, such as chemical intolerance or
environmental illness (specific to chemical exposures).3 MCS fol-
lows a two-step process of (i) initiation of the disease, often from
exposure to petrochemical products, and then (ii) triggering of
symptoms when exposed to problematic chemicals, often at low
levels.3,7 While significant efforts have been devoted to developing
case definitions and diagnostic criteria,3,8,9 a single internationally
agreed-upon standard for prevalence studies is not yet established.
Nonetheless, prior population-based studies of MCS, using specific
and often different definitions and criteria, offer useful data on the
extent and severity of the condition.
In the USA, two previous nationally representative studies,
conducted in 2002 to 20034 and 2005 to 2006,5 investigated the
prevalence of MCS by using the key question developed by the
California Department of Health Services (CDHS)10: ‘‘Compared to
other people, do you consider yourself allergic or unusually sensi-
tive to everyday chemicals like those in household cleaning prod-
ucts, paints, perfumes, detergents, insect spray and things like
that?’’ This criterion reflects self-reported chemical sensitivity.
To ascertain a medical diagnosis of MCS, the survey asked,
‘‘Has a doctor or health care professional ever told you that you
have multiple chemical sensitivities?’’ This criterion reflects medi-
cally diagnosed MCS. These two USA studies found (respectively)
a prevalence of 11.1% and 11.6% self-reported chemical sensitivity
and 2.5% and 3.9% medically diagnosed MCS.
At the state and regional level in the USA, using the CDHS
criteria, a survey of 4046 Californians in 199510 found a prevalence of
15.9% self-reported chemical sensitivity and 6.3% medically diag-
nosed MCS. A survey of 1583 metropolitan Atlantans in 1999 to
2000,1alsousingtheCDHScriteria,foundaprevalenceof12.6%self-
reported chemical sensitivity and 3.1% diagnosed MCS. A survey of
1027 individuals in North Carolina in 1993,7 using a question similar
to CDHS, found a prevalence of 33% chemical sensitivity.
In Sweden, using the chemical sensitivity scale for sensory
hyperreactivity (CSS-SHR),11 an investigation of 1387 adults in
Sko
¨vde found a prevalence of 33% of self-reported general odor
intolerance, or being bothered by strong or pungent odors, such as
perfume, cleaning agents, or flower scents.12 Also in Sweden, a
survey of 3406 adult respondents from Va
¨sterbotten found 12.2%
reported chemical intolerance to odorous pungent chemicals, such
as perfumes and cleaning agents, and 3.3% were physician-diag-
nosed with chemical intolerance.
In Australia, a population-based survey of 4009 adults in
South Australia in 2001 to 2002,13 using a variation of the CDHS
question, found a prevalence of 15.9% of self-reported chemical
sensitivity and 1% medically diagnosed MCS. In Japan, a national
survey of 7245 adults,14 using the Quick Environmental Exposure
and Sensitivity Inventory (QEESI) questionnaire,9 found a preva-
lence of 7.5% for chemical intolerance. In Korea, a survey of 379
adults, also using the QEESI, found a prevalence of 16.4% for
chemical intolerance.15
While these studies provide useful context, we lack recent
nationally representative data in the USA. A primary objective of this
study is to provide a current estimate of the prevalence of MCS in the
American population. Also, given previous studies indicating con-
nections,asecondobjectiveistoinvestigatetheco-occurrenceofMCS

products are a common trigger, a third objective is to investigate the
effects of exposure to fragranced products for individuals with MCS,
which points to ways to reduce potential adverse effects.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
 adult US population, representative of age, gender, and region
(n ¼ 1137, 95% confidence level, 3% margin of error), drawn from
a large national panel (over 5,000,000 people) held by Survey
Sampling International. The survey instrument was developed
and tested over a 2-year period before full implementation in June
2016. Response rate was 95%, and all responses were anonymous.
(Details on survey methodology, questions, and data are provided in
the files ‘‘Survey Methodology’’ and ‘‘Survey Data’’ as Supple-
mental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/JOM/A412 and http://
links.lww.com/JOM/A413.)
To promote comparability, the survey replicated questions
from previous large US national, state, and regional MCS preva-
lence studies.1,4,5,7,10 In accordance, to ascertain medically diag-
nosed MCS, the survey asked, ‘‘Has a doctor or health care
professional ever told you that you have multiple chemical sensi-
tivities?’’ To ascertain self-reported chemical sensitivity, the survey
asked, ‘‘Compared to other people, do you consider yourself allergic
or unusually sensitive to everyday chemicals like those in household
cleaning products, paints, perfumes, detergents, insect spray and
things like that?’’
To ascertain asthma, the survey asked ‘‘Has a doctor or health
care professional ever told you that you have asthma or an asthma-
like condition?’’ and then further asked to specify whether asthma or
an asthma-like condition. The term ‘‘asthmatic’’ will be used herein
to encompass individuals with either asthma or an asthma-like
condition or both.
To ascertain fragrance sensitivity, the survey investigated
health effects associated with exposures to fragranced consumer
products. A ‘‘fragranced consumer product,’’ or ‘‘fragranced prod-
uct’’ for brevity, is a chemically formulated product with the
addition of a fragrance or scent.6 An individual was considered
to characterize fragrance sensitivity if they experienced one or more
types of health problems from one or more types of fragranced
products and exposure contexts.
Fragranced product types were categorized as follows: air
fresheners and deodorizers, personal care products, cleaning sup-
plies, laundry products, household products, fragrance, and other.
Health effects were categorized as follows: migraine headaches;
asthma attacks; neurological problems; respiratory problems; skin
problems; cognitive problems; mucosal symptoms; immune system
problems; gastrointestinal problems; cardiovascular problems; mus-
culoskeletal problems; and other. (Additional details on specific
product types and health effects within each category, along with
response data, are provided in the file ‘‘Survey Data’’ as Supple-
mental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/JOM/A413.)
Specific exposure contexts were air fresheners or deodorizers
used in public restrooms and other environments, scented laundry
products coming from a dryer vent, being in a room after it was
cleaned with scented cleaning products, being near someone wear-
ing a fragranced product, entering a business with the scent of
fragranced products, fragranced soap used in public restrooms, and
ability to access environments that used fragranced products. The
survey also investigated effects of fragrance exposure in the work-
place, access to public places that used fragranced products, and
preferences for fragrance-free environments and policies. Data on
fragranced product exposures and effects were derived from a
survey of the general population,6 while the present study focuses
specifically on effects on the subpopulations of individuals with
MCS or chemical sensitivity.
RESULTS
A national prevalence of 12.8% medically diagnosed MCS,
25.9% self-reported chemical sensitivity, and 27.5% either or both,
was assessed by the survey. (See Table 1.) Compared with previous
studies,4,5 the prevalence of diagnosed MCS has increased over
three times (2.5%, 3.9% to 12.8%) and self-reported chemical
sensitivity has increased over two times (11.1%, 11.6% to
25.9%) in a little over 10 years.
In addition, 71.0% of those with MCS are asthmatic: diag-
nosed with asthma (40.0%), an asthma-like condition (34.5%), or
both. Also, 59.2% with chemical sensitivity are asthmatic: diag-
nosed with asthma (35.0%), an asthma-like condition (26.2%),
or both (See Table 1). Compared with previous studies,4,5 the co-
occurrence of asthma with diagnosed MCS (42.3%, 39.0% vs

 40.0%) and with chemical sensitivity (34.2%, 34.9% vs 35.0%) is
relatively similar.
Fragranced consumer products were found to trigger a range
of adverse health and societal effects. When exposed to fragranced
consumer products, 86.2% of those with MCS experience one or
more types of health problems, including respiratory difficulties
(50.3%), migraine headaches (46.9%), mucosal symptoms (46.9%),
skin problems (37.9%), and asthma attacks (31.7%). Similarly,
81.2% of those with chemical sensitivity report one or more types
of health problems when exposed to fragranced products (see
Tables 1 and 2).
Specific exposures triggering health problems include air
fresheners and deodorizers (67.6%), scented laundry products com-
ing from a dryer vent (57.9%), being in a room recently cleaned with
scented products (67.6%), being near someone wearing a fragranced
product (65.5%), and in general fragranced consumer products
(73.1%) (see Table 3, and the file ‘‘Survey Data’’ as Supplemental
Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/JOM/A413).
For 76.0% of people with MCS, the severity of these health
problems was potentially disabling according to the criterion of the
Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008
(ADAAA), asked by the question: ‘‘Do any of these health problems
substantially limit one or more major life activities, such as seeing,
hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speak-
ing, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, commu-
nicating, or working, for you personally?’’16 (See Table 4.)
Fragranced products also restrict access in society: 58.6% of
individuals with MCS are unable to use public restrooms that have
an air freshener, deodorizer, or scented product; 55.2% are unable to
wash their hands in a public place if the soap is fragranced; 63.4%
enter a business but then want to leave as quickly as possible due to a
fragranced product; and 70.3% have been prevented from going
someplace because of the presence of a fragranced product that
would make them sick. (See Table 4.)
Significantly,60.7%ofthosewithMCSlostworkdaysorajobin
the past year due to illness from fragranced product exposure in the
workplace.Further,71%ofthosewithMCSwouldsupportafragrance-
free policy in the workplace, and 82.1% would prefer that health care
facilities and professionals were fragrance-free. (See Table 4.)
Demographic proportions of diagnosed MCS are 57.9% male
and 42.1% female, compared with the general population of 46.2%
male and 53.8% female. Thus, diagnosed MCS has a male bias
(þ11.7%). Previous national prevalence studies in the US found
instead a slight female bias. Relative to gender and age, the highest
bias (percentage MCS greater than general population) is male 25 to
34 (þ12.7%). (See Table 5.)
DISCUSSION
Results of this study provide evidence that MCS is wide-
spread and increasing in the US population: an estimated
25.6 million adults are diagnosed with MCS, and an estimated
51.8 million adults report chemical sensitivity.17 Using the same

 criteria to assess MCS and chemical sensitivity as prior US national
prevalence studies, this represents an increase of 300% in diag-
nosed MCS and 200% in self-reported chemical sensitivity in a
little more than 10 years.
Among individuals diagnosed with MCS, 71.0% report being
diagnosed also with asthma or an asthma-like condition. Thus,
individuals with MCS are proportionally more likely to be asthmatic
than individuals without MCS (prevalence odds ratio 9.6; 95%
confidence interval 6.5 to 14.2).
In addition, among individuals with MCS, 86.2% report
adverse health effects from exposure to fragranced consumer prod-
ucts. Thus, individuals with MCS are proportionally more likely to
be fragrance sensitive than individuals without MCS (prevalence
odds ratio 16.8; 95% confidence interval 10.3 to 27.5).
As a consequence, individuals with MCS are prevented from
accessing restrooms, businesses, workplaces, and public places due
to risk of adverse health effects—some potentially disabling—from
fragranced consumer products. Notably, exposure to fragranced
consumer products is associated with lost workdays or a job, in
the past year, for 11.0% of the adult population with MCS or
chemical sensitivity, representing an estimated 22 million Ameri-
cans. While researchers continue to investigate which chemicals or
mixtures of chemicals in fragranced consumer products could be
associated with adverse effects,18 a practical step in the meantime
would be to reduce exposure to the products. For instance, 71.0% of
those with MCS would support fragrance-free policies in the
workplace, and 82.1% would prefer fragrance-free health care
facilities and professionals, as would a majority of the US general
population.6
Limitations of the study include the following: (a) data were
based on self-reports, although a standard and accepted method for
epidemiological research, and consistent with prior prevalence
studies of MCS; (b) only adults (ages 18 to 65) were surveyed;
(c) all possible fragranced products and health effects were not

 included, although the low percentages for responses in the ‘‘other’’
category indicates the survey captured the primary products and
effects; and (d) MCS and chemical sensitivity lack standard diag-
nostic criteria, although the survey replicated questions from prior
large-scale USA prevalence studies to promote comparability.
CONCLUSION
The prevalence of MCS has increased across the American
population, and it frequently co-occurs with asthma and fragrance
sensitivity. Moreover, fragranced consumer products, such as air
fresheners and scented cleaning products, trigger significant adverse
health and societal effects among individuals with MCS. Reducing
exposure to fragranced products, such as through fragrance-free poli-
cies, would be an important practical step to reduce the adverse effects.
