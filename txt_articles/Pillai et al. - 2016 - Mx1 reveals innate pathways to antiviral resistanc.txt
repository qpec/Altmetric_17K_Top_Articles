 Hobit. We identified 4510 genome-wide binding
sites for Blimp1, which could be assigned to 3241
genes. Hobit bound 404 sites, >50% of which
overlapped with Blimp1 (fig. S17). Note that 78%
of the 199 genes bound by Hobit were also bound
by Blimp1, whereas 31% of the genes deregulated
in the absence of Hobit and Blimp1 were bound by
Hobit, Blimp1, or both (Fig. 4E). Hobit and Blimp1
used nearly identical binding motifs (Fig. 4F),
which supports the notion of extensive coopera-
tion between both factors. Hobit and Blimp1 bound
target sequences within the S1pr1, Ccr7, and Tcf7
loci, which suggested direct repression of these
genes (Fig. 4G). In addition, Blimp1, but not Hobit,
bound within the Klf2 locus (Fig. 4G). Thus, Hobit
and Blimp1 mediate a transcriptional program of
tissue residency that is shared among Trm, trNK,
and NKT cells and includes the suppression of
tissue egress genes.
The recent recognition of Trm cells as essen-
tial sentinels at barrier tissues (27–30) highlights
the importance of understanding their develop-
ment. We have characterized a universal tran-
scriptional program of tissue residency that is
shared between adaptive and innate lympho-
cytes at both epithelial and nonepithelial sites.
Our findings reveal the central roles of Hobit and
Blimp1 in the establishment of tissue residency
and indicate that they function by silencing lym-
phocyte egress from the tissues and by repres-
sing the development of circulating memory
cells. The key insights into the transcriptional
regulation of Trm cells within this study may
assist in the manipulation of tissue-resident
memory for the development of vaccine strat-
egies to improve localized immunity.

Influenza A virus (IAV) causes up to half a million deaths worldwide annually, 90% of which
occur in older adults. We show that IAV-infected monocytes from older humans have
impaired antiviral interferon production but retain intact inflammasome responses. To
understand the in vivo consequence, we used mice expressing a functional Mx gene
encoding a major interferon-induced effector against IAV in humans. In Mx1-intact mice with
weakened resistance due to deficiencies in Mavs and Tlr7, we found an elevated respiratory
bacterial burden. Notably, mortality in the absence of Mavs and Tlr7 was independent of
viral load or MyD88-dependent signaling but dependent on bacterial burden, caspase-1/11,
and neutrophil-dependent tissue damage. Therefore, in the context of weakened antiviral
resistance, vulnerability to IAV disease is a function of caspase-dependent pathology.
R
espiratory infections with influenza A virus
(IAV) cause severe morbidity and mortality
in humans and animals worldwide. Older
humans are highly susceptible to influenza
disease. Thissusceptibilitycouldbe dueto an
inability to mount an effective antiviral response
or an incapacity to develop disease tolerance to IAV
infection (1–4). We began by comparing the innate
immune pathways engaged by IAV infections in
peripheral blood monocytes from young-adult
(20- to 30-year-old) and older (65- to 89-year-old)
human donors (table S1 and fig. S1A). IAV-infected
monocytes from older humans showed intact
nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)–dependent proinflam-
matory cytokine expression and secretion [inter-
leukin (IL)–6] (fig. S1B and Fig. 1A) and robust
inflammasome-dependent cytokine expression
and secretion (IL-1b) (fig. S1C and Fig. 1B). Type
I interferon (IFN) responses to IAV infection,
however, were significantly attenuated in older
human monocytes (IFN-b) (Fig. 1C). Reduced

 IFN secretion from older monocytes was not at-
tributable to the expression level of RIG-I, a viral
RNA sensor that induces the type I IFN responses
that drive antiviral immunity (5, 6) (fig. S1D) or
to a particular demographic group (fig. S1, E to
G). Similar age-dependent reduction in IFN-b was
observed from monocytes transfected with ligands
of RIG-I (fig. S2, A to F) and from macrophages
stimulated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid
(fig. S2, G to I). These data indicate that older
human monocytes and macrophages have intact
RIG-I signaling to activate proinflammatory cyto-
kines and the inflammasome but have impaired
signaling to induce type I IFNs.
Comparison of a broader array of genes re-
vealed that infected monocytes from older donors
showed consistently lower expression of several
IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (MxA, IFITM2, and
ISG15, all of which are known to have antiviral
activities for influenza viruses) (Fig. 1D). Further-
more, expression of IRF7, a critical transcription
factor for type I IFNs, and STAT1, a type I IFN
receptor signaling molecule, was lower in the older
cohort. Consequently, older monocytes infected
with IAV expressed higher levels of influenza viral
genes (NS and M) (Fig. 1D). Selective impairment
in IFN responses to other viral infections (7), after
vaccination against influenza (8) or downstream
of TLR7 (4, 9, 10), suggest that decreased IFN and
elevated proinflammatory cytokines are a com-
mon characteristic of the aging innate immune
system in humans.
To probe the possible in vivo consequences of
weak IFN responses in the face of robust inflam-
mation after IAV infection, we sought to employ
a relevant mouse model. Older C57BL/6 mice did
not show increased susceptibility to IAV infec-
tion over young mice; in fact, older mice showed
antiviral resistance (fig. S3), failing to phenocopy
aging human infections (11). We therefore decided
to mimic human innate effector responses using
geneticapproaches todetermine the consequences
of the loss of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
that induce IFNs during IAV infection. Inbred
mouse strains, including C57BL/6, carry non-
functional alleles of the Mx1 gene. The myxovirus
resistance protein 1 (Mx1) is a dynamin-like gua-
nosine triphosphatase that blocks primary tran-
scription of influenza, presumably by binding to
viral nucleoproteins (12–14). We predicted that
intact Mx1 would affect the dynamics of viral
spread and the host response to IAV infection,
and that Mx1-sufficient mice would more closely
model influenza pathogenesis in humans. As re-
ported previously (15, 16), Mx1 congenic mice
on the C57BL/6 background were highly resist-
ant to IAV (A/PR8) infections as compared with

 Mx1-deficient C57BL/6 mice (fig. S4). The ob-
served resistance in Mx1 congenic mice was not
due to more robust adaptive immunity because
these mice showed low levels of T and B cell–
mediated responses to IAV, likely because of
rapid viral clearance (fig. S4, D and E).
We therefore used Mx1 mice to investigate the
relative contributions of the innate immune-
sensing pathways during IAV infection: Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I, which both induce
type I IFNs (5), and the inflammasome pathway
that activates caspase-1, releases IL-1b and IL-18,
and induces pyroptosis (17, 18). At a high dose of
viral challenge [106 plaque-forming units (PFU)],
Tlr7–/– or Casp1/11–/– mice survived infection,
whereas Mavs–/– and Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– mice lost
weight and died by day 7 or day 5, respectively,
with a high viral burden (fig. S5). After challenge
with a lower dose of A/PR8 virus (100 PFU),
Tlr7–/–, Mavs–/–, and Casp1/11–/– mice were resist-
ant, but Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– double-deficient mice
lost weight and succumbed to infection (Fig. 2, A
and B). The mechanism of protection conferred
by MAVS and TLR7 in the Mx1-sufficient host
correlated with the ability of these PRRs to
induce IFN-b secretion (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in-
flammatory cytokine secretion was observed in-
dependently of MAVS and TLR7 (fig. S6). Mice
deficient in both Mavs and Tlr7 lost Mx1 expres-
sion (Fig. 2D and fig. S7) and therefore succumbed

 to IAV challenge. Thus, unlike C57BL/6 mice
(19–22), Mx1 congenic mice reveal the key innate
sensors that confer antiviral resistance, RIG-I and
TLR7; these sensors are responsible for the pro-
duction of type I IFNs that induce Mx1 expres-
sion and potently control IAV replication. This is
consistent with our results in monocytes from
older humans, where impaired RIG-I signaling
led to low IFN induction and compromised in-
nate IAV resistance (Fig. 1).
To assess the role of inflammasome activation
in the context of an impaired interferon response,
we generated Mx1 congenic Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– ×
Casp1/11–/– mice. Strikingly, these mice exhibited
protection from IAV disease (Fig. 3, A and B)despite
having viral loads similar to Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– mice
(Fig. 3C and fig. S8A). Improved protection was
therefore not a function of greater antiviral
resistance but a lack of Casp1/11 activity. Tlr7–/– ×
Mavs–/– × Casp1/11–/– mice eventually cleared the
virus by 30 days after infection (fig. S8B). Tlr7–/– ×
Mavs–/– mice also succumbed to infection with a
human isolate of the 2009 pandemic strain of
H1N1 (pH1N1) faster than other genotypes at two
challenge doses (fig. S9). Furthermore, Tlr7–/– ×
Mavs–/– × Casp1/11–/– mice exhibited longer survival
compared with Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– mice at a chal-
lenge dose of 105 PFU (fig. S9, C and D). These
results indicate that after IAV infection, Casp1/11
deficiency confers a survival advantage in the
context of combined Tlr7 and Mavs deficiency.
Next, we investigated the contributions of
caspase-1/11–dependent cytokines, IL-1b and IL-18,
in driving IAV disease and lethality. MyD88 is
an adaptor protein required for signaling down-
stream of IL-1R and IL-18R (23), as well as TLR7.
Unlike Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– × Casp1/11–/– mice, Mx1
congenic MyD88–/– × Mavs–/– mice succumbed
to A/PR8 infection, albeit with a delayed time
course compared with Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– mice
(Fig. 3D). Infected MyD88–/– × Mavs–/– mice sus-
tained levels of IAV burden in the lung similar
to Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– and Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– ×
Casp1/11–/– mice (fig. S8B). In addition, treat-
ment with Anakinra (IL-1R antagonist) failed to
rescue Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– mice from IAV-induced
lethality (Fig. 3D). Histological analysis of the
lungs (fig. S10) revealed that Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/–
mice sustained severe inflammation around air-
ways and suffered from airway degeneration and
epithelial and venular necrosis (fig. S10B, arrow).
In contrast, Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– × Casp1/11–/– mice
had less severe inflammation and reduced venu-
lar necrosis. Therefore, signaling through IL-1R
and IL-18R is insufficient to drive IAV-induced
mortality in the absence of RLR and TLR signal-
ing, and a separate function of caspase-1/11, lead-
ing to inflammation and tissue damage, is required
for lethal disease after IAV infection.
One of the hallmarks of caspase-1/11 activation
is the recruitment of neutrophils (24). Neutro-
philic infiltration largely accounts for fatal influ-
enza gene signatures (25). Robust and comparable
recruitment of many inflammatory leukocytes, in-
cluding neutrophils, was observed in bothTlr7–/– ×
Mavs–/– and Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– × Casp1/11–/– mice
infected with IAV (fig. S11). To determine wheth-
er neutrophils mediate disease and lethality in
Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– mice carrying functional Mx1
alleles, we depleted neutrophils in vivo using an
antibody to Ly6G. Half of neutrophil-depleted
Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– mice survived the infection (Fig.
4A), indicating that neutrophils contribute to IAV
lethality. Neutrophils mediate clearance of bacte-
ria and fungi but also cause immunopathology,
owing to their release of reactive oxygen species
and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (26).
Notably, the lungs of the IAV-infected Tlr7–/– ×
Mavs–/– mice had significantly higher staining for
NETs (27) than the Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– × Casp1/11–/–
mice (Fig. 4B and fig. S12). Furthermore, we found
that caspase-1/11 was also required for NET for-
mation in the lung after intranasal inoculation of
bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (fig. S13), in-
dicating that the requirement of Casp1/11 for
NET release extends beyond IAV infection. NET
digestion by treatment with deoxyribonuclease
(DNase) (Pulmozyme) resulted in prolonged sur-
vival of Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– mice after IAV infection
(Fig. 4A). Thus, in the absence of Tlr7 and Mavs,
NETosis contributes to mortality after IAV infec-
tion, likely in part by inducing collateral tissue
damage (28). Despite the lack of innate viral con-
trol, depletion of neutrophils or degradation of
NETs can induce disease tolerance to influenza.
Older adults (>65 years of age) are most vul-
nerable to the flu, and many succumb to pneu-
monia caused by secondary bacterial infections
(29, 30). IAV infection and consequent airway
epithelial damage are sufficient to enhance bac-
terial colonization of the lungs (31–35). There-
fore, we hypothesized that IAV-induced disease
and mortality in the Tlr7−/− × Mavs−/− mice may
be secondary to bacterial infection. Notably, bac-
terial bloom was observed in the nasal cavity of
infected Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– and Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– ×
Casp1/11–/–mice, ascomparedwiththe IAV-resistant
wild-type mice (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, an
increase in the abundance of Pasteurellaceae was
observed in the nasal cavities (Fig. 4E) and lungs
(Fig. 4, F and G) of IAV-infected Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/–
and Tlr7–/– × Mavs–/– × Casp1/11–/– mice. Finally,
combination antibiotic treatment beginning 3
days after IAV infection partially rescued Tlr7−/− ×
Mavs−/− mice from lethality (Fig. 4H). Collect-
ively, these data indicate that a failure to induce
type I IFNs promotes viral amplification and tis-
sue damage within the respiratory environment,
conducive to bacterial bloom. Neutrophil recruit-
ment and caspase-dependent NETosis contrib-
utes to lethality. These results in Mx1 congenic
mice are consistent with the notion that age-
related defects in innate immunity (reduced IFN
responses) could predispose IAV-infected older
adults to secondary bacterial infection. A direct
implication of our findings is that older adults
suffering from IAV infection may benefit from
therapeutic strategies that minimize inflamma-
tory responses mediated by neutrophils.
