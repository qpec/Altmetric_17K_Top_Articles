Participation in organized sports has a variety of health benefits but also has 
the potential to expose the athlete to a variety of infectious diseases, some of 
which may produce outbreaks. Major risk factors for infection include skin-
to-skin contact with athletes who have active skin infections, environmental 
exposures and physical trauma, and sharing of equipment and contact 
with contaminated fomites. Close contact that is intrinsic to team sports 
and psychosocial factors associated with adolescence are additional risks. 
Minimizing risk requires leadership by the organized sports community 
(including the athlete’s primary care provider) and depends on outlining key 
hygiene behaviors, recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of common sports-
related infections, and the implementation of preventive interventions.
abstract
IntroductIon
The definition of organized sports includes traditional team sports 
commonly acknowledged as well as other types of sports (‍Table 1).  
Participation in organized sports provides the benefits of (‍1) physical 
activity, by engaging in vigorous exercise, achieving fitness, and 
learning athletic skills; (‍2) socialization, by experiencing camaraderie 
and learning teamwork and sportsmanship; and (‍3) competition, 
by challenging oneself to perform against others, by striving to 
continually improve oneself toward achieving one’s full athletic 
potential, and by learning to win and lose with grace and dignity.1 
Organized sports participation, however, can result in the acquisition 
of a variety of infectious diseases and conditions. Physical contact 
among athletes, sharing of equipment (‍such as worn personal 
protective equipment or braces plus towels, drinking vessels, 
showers, and locker rooms), and contact with athletic surfaces (‍mats, 
artificial turf, dirt, grass, and gym or weight room equipment) can all 
be responsible for transmission of infection.2

organized sports carry specific additional risks; for example, wrestlers

Athletes should be taught proper 
personal hygiene (‍eg, hand-washing, 
showering, and proper laundering 
of uniforms and practice clothing 
on a daily or regular basis).12

Avoidance of sharing of drinking 
vessels (‍water bottles, ladles, 
or cups), mouth guards, towels, 
braces, batting helmets, personal 
protective equipment, bars of soap, 
bath sponges, razors or electric 
hair shavers, and callus trimmers 
is also important in reducing 
infectious risk.2 
– 
9 In addition, 
athletic programs should ensure 
regular (‍daily, weekly, and monthly) 
cleaning of facilities and equipment 
(‍eg, weight room, railings, mats, 
blocking dummies, locker rooms, 
and showers).16 
– 
19 Those who 
manage sports programs and 
facilities should develop a plan for 
proper cleaning and maintenance 
of a sanitary sporting environment 
by using guidelines such as those 
published by the American College 
of Sports Medicine.20
Special attention should be paid 
to proper management of blood 
and other body fluids.21 Just as 
hospitals in the United States have 
concentrated on preventing hospital-
associated infections in recent years, 
the same level of focus on infection 
prevention and control needs to 
be present within the organized 
sports community, including 
among athletes, parents, coaches, 
athletic directors, equipment 
managers, certified athletic trainers, 
administrators, janitorial staff, team 
physicians, facility managers, and 
league officials.
Although the primary care 
pediatrician may appear to be 
peripheral in this athletic milieu 
of organized sports, leadership 
from physicians has always 
been welcome and expected 
regarding issues of public health 
and safety. Furthermore, because 
pediatricians need to provide 
medical clearance to athletes to 
participate in organized sports, 
the preparticipation physical 
examination is an opportunity to 
verify that the athlete does not 
have a skin condition or infection 
that could be transmitted to others. 
This visit between the physician 
and the student athlete allows the 
primary care pediatrician to deliver 
anticipatory guidance. Ensuring 
that immunizations are current per 
recommendations of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 
the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices, and the 
American Academy of Pediatrics is 
important, and pediatric providers 
should identify and document cases 
in which vaccines are refused or 
incomplete because of medical 
exemptions (‍eg, serious allergy to 
a vaccine component). Coaches and 
trainers are primarily responsible 
for reviewing and stressing to the 
athlete the key hygiene behaviors 
needed to minimize the risk of 
obtaining or spreading infection 
in organized sports. However, 
primary care pediatricians can 
help reinforce such educational 
messages.
organIsms assocIated WIth 
InfectIons In athletes
An athlete can acquire many 
different infections by participating 
in organized sports. The pathogens 
include many that are prominent in 
outbreaks typically seen in crowded 
communities or closed community 
settings or that are facilitated by 
certain exposures specific to the 
sport.
Infectious pathogens include 
those spread by skin contact (‍eg, 
Staphylococcus aureus, group 
A streptococcal skin infections, 
Bacillus cereus, herpes simplex 
virus [HSV], Tinea capitis, Tinea 
corporis, Tinea pedis, Tinea cruris, 
Pediculosis capitis, Pediculosis 
corporis, and Pediculosis pubis), by 
contaminated food or water (‍eg, 
Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia 
coli, Shigella species, Giardia 
species, Cryptosporidium species, 
and norovirus, which is further 
propagated by the person-to-person 
route), by respiratory droplet 
(‍eg, influenza, pertussis, Neisseria 
meningitidis, group A streptococcal 
pharyngitis, mumps), by airborne 
particles (‍eg, varicella, measles), or 
by certain vectors (‍eg, ticks) (‍Table 2).  
In the case of Epstein-Barr virus 
infection, close contact is required 
for transmission, and endemic 
disease within adolescent group 
settings has been reported (‍Table 2).  
Although biologically plausible, 
there have been no validated reports 
of infections from transmission of 
bloodborne pathogens, including 
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV 
during athletic competitions. 
Nonetheless, the American Academy 
of Pediatrics has previously issued 
specific detailed guidelines for 
management of infections spread 
by blood and body fluids, including 
guidance for athletes who are 
infected with HIV, hepatitis B virus, 
or hepatitis C virus, and these will 
not be reiterated in this statement.21
Transmission of a specific infectious 
agent may be affected by a variety of 
psychosocial (‍sexually transmitted 
infection), physical (‍trauma, 
closed community contact), and 
environmental (‍soil, food, water, 
vector) factors, especially in an

Downloaded from 
 immunologically naïve population. 
This policy will be focused on 
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention 
of the most common infections that 
may be encountered in the athlete 
participating in organized sports, 
with an additional focus on factors 
that are potentially modifiable. 
It should be noted that some of 
the organisms discussed can be 
transmitted in multiple fashions. 
Transmission of pathogens spread 
by contaminated food or water, by 
respiratory droplets, and by vectors 
are similar to what can be expected 
under nonsporting conditions51 and 
are beyond the scope of this report. 
Although several of these pathogens 
are summarized in Table 2, detailed 
descriptions in this clinical report 
are provided only for the organisms 
transmitted primarily by contact, 
manifesting primarily on the skin, 
and those that are airborne.
InfectIons PrImarIly sPread By 
contact transmIssIon
Most sports-related skin infections 
are spread by contact and have 
been associated with 10% to 15% 
of time-loss injuries among athletes 
at the collegiate level.52 For this 
reason, routine screening of athletes 
participating in contact sports during 
practices and before competitions 
is important. The Sports Medicine 
Advisory Committee of the National 
Federation of State High School 
Associations (‍NFHS), 
53 the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
(‍NCAA), 
54 and the National Athletic 
Trainers Association (‍NATA)55 
have published guidelines for 
screening and when to return to 
athletic participation for several 
conditions (‍summarized in Table 
3). It is noteworthy that many of 
the recommendations by these 
organizations are more stringent 
than ordinary infection control 
practices for similar conditions in 
which the likelihood of the type 
of close bodily contact is not as 
significant.
S Aureus
Community-acquired methicillin-
resistant S aureus (‍MRSA) is a cause 
of outbreaks of skin infections among 
high school and collegiate athletes 
participating in contact sports, 
particularly among football players 
and wrestlers, and is associated with 
significant morbidity. It manifests 
primarily as cellulitis or skin 
abscesses but may lead to invasive 
disease such as bacteremia, septic 
arthritis, osteomyelitis, myositis, 
fasciitis, and pneumonia in up to 
10% of cases.56, 
 
57 Other noninvasive 
forms of disease including impetigo, 
staphylococcal ecthyma, pustulosis, 
and folliculitis may also pose a risk 
for transmission of the organism 
from those so affected. Players 
who have preexisting skin diseases 
such as atopic dermatitis may have 
chronic colonization with S aureus 
and may be predisposed to recurrent 
secondary infection. Between 10% 
and 23% of football players or 
wrestlers have developed signs and 
symptoms during outbreaks.5, 
 
58– 
60 
Risk factors for infection include skin 
breaks associated with turf burns 
or trauma, 
58 skin-to-skin contact, 
sharing of equipment or clothing 
(‍towels), and higher BMI.5, 
 
19, 
59 
Although 4% to 23% of athletes have 
been found to have colonization with 
MRSA, high colonization alone does 
not appear sufficient to trigger an 
outbreak.61 Wrestling mats, artificial 
turfs, and football training equipment 
have been documented with MRSA 
colonization.19, 
 
62, 
 
63
Incidence estimates of MRSA-related 
skin and soft tissue infections in 
Nebraska student athletes have 
ranged from 11.3 to 20.9 per 10 000 
football players and 28.1 to 60.8 
per 10 000 wrestlers from 2008 
to 2012.64 Among 190 high school 
football players in northeast Ohio 
who were managed prospectively 
with nasal swab cultures, 23% 
displayed methicillin-susceptible  
S aureus colonization (‍none carried 
MRSA). Of the participating athletes, 
10 (‍5.3%) developed skin infections, 
including 7 with impetigo and 1 with 
folliculitis barbae during the course 
of the 2008 season. None of the 
cultured specimens tested positive 
for MRSA.65
group a Streptococcus
Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus 
(‍GABHS) has been associated 
with outbreaks of skin infections 
after indoor association football 
tournaments, 
66 rugby, 
67, 
 
68 and other 
organized sports. The organism 
can cause localized skin infections 
such as pyoderma, cellulitis, or 
impetigo or invasive infections 
such as thrombophlebitis, myositis, 
and sepsis. GABHS has also been 
associated with outbreaks of 
pharyngitis among university 
students (‍median age 19.5 years) 
participating in judo.69 Within 
a 15-day period, 12 of 23 club 
members in Tokyo, Japan, presented 
with sore throat and high fever. 
Diagnosis was made by use of either 
a rapid streptococcal antigen test or 
positive throat culture for GABHS 
when the clinical presentation 
was suggestive of pharyngitis. 
Occasionally, outbreaks of invasive 
GABHS disease have been reported

Bleach baths (‍Clorox: regular 6.0% 
hypochlorite, 5 mL, added to 1 gallon 
of water) used twice weekly reduced 
the recurrence rates among children 
with community-associated S aureus 
infections by 20% compared with 
control children managed with 
routine hygienic measures, but this 
was not a statistically significant 
reduction.73 Screening for S aureus 
and GABHS requires knowledge 
of what body sites would have 
colonization. Nasal, skin, vaginal, 
and rectal carriage are the primary 
reservoirs for S aureus. In the context 
of sports-related infections, the 
primary culture sites should be the 
nares and any open skin lesions.
GABHS screening should be 
performed through vigorous 
swabbing of a pair of swabs on 
both tonsils and the posterior 
pharynx for rapid antigen detection 
and culture as well as culture of 
any skin lesions, especially those 
that are oozing or macerated.23 
Measurement of sequential 
streptococcal antibody titers 
may also be used to diagnose a 
recent infection, but this is not 
recommended for routine use.74

 Skin abscesses are best managed by 
incision and drainage, with culture 
of the wound for identification of 
causative agent and antimicrobial 
susceptibility pattern along with 
empirical antibiotic coverage pending 
culture results. Antibiotic choices 
should be guided by knowledge of 
the local patterns of susceptibility 
of S aureus, especially local rates 
of MRSA. Methicillin-susceptible 
S aureus typically is treated 
with oral penicillinase-resistant 
β-lactam drugs, such as a first- or 
second-generation cephalosporin. 
For patients who are allergic to 
penicillin, or if MRSA is a significant 
consideration, the alternatives are 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 
doxycycline, or clindamycin for 
susceptible isolates.22 Doxycycline 
can be used safely in children ages 
2 years and older when given 
for durations less than 2 weeks. 
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
should not be used as a single agent 
in the initial treatment of cellulitis 
because of the possibility it is  
caused by group A Streptococcus  
and the possibility of intrinsic 
resistance of this organism.75 
– 
77 
Topical mupirocin may be used for 
localized and nonbullous impetigo. 
During outbreaks, attempts at 
eradication of S aureus infections to 
limit spread may be accomplished 
by use of topical nasal mupirocin 
therapy (‍twice daily for 5–7 days) 
among people with colonization. 
However, low-level (‍minimum 
inhibitory concentration, 8–256 
µg/mL) and high-level (‍minimum 
inhibitory concentration, >512  
µg/mL) resistance to mupirocin have 
been identified in S aureus. High-level 
resistance has been associated with 
subsequent failure of decolonization.
GABHS typically is susceptible to 
penicillin, and this is the usual first-
line therapy.74 An oral macrolide 
or azalide (‍eg, erythromycin, 
clarithromycin, or azithromycin) 
is acceptable for patients who 
are allergic to penicillin. Duration 
of treatment is 10 days, with the 
exception of azithromycin, which 
is indicated for 5 days. Local 
mupirocin78 
– 
80 or retapamulin81 
– 
83 
ointment may be useful for 
limiting person-to-person spread 
of nonbullous impetigo and for 
eradicating localized GABHS disease. 
Guidelines from the NCAA, NFHS, and 
NATA for when the infected athlete 
can return to competition for both 
GABHS and S aureus are summarized 
in Table 3.
Prevention of S Aureus and gaBhs 
outbreaks
Prevention of infections caused 
by MRSA and GABHS is achieved 
primarily through good hygiene 
practices, not sharing equipment 
and water bottles, limiting 
exposure to infected people and 
contaminated surfaces and objects, 
decontamination of the environment, 
and prompt identification, proper 
treatment, and close follow-up of 
infected people.4,

71 Athletes 
with GABHS pharyngitis or skin 
infections should not return to 
competitive sports for at least 24 
hours after beginning appropriate 
oral antimicrobial therapy.23 Table 3 
summarizes recommendations of the 
NCAA, NFHS, and NATA for return 
to competition for patients with S 
aureus infections, including MRSA.
herpes gladiatorum and herpes 
rugbiorum
HSV (‍primarily type 1) has been 
identified as a cause of outbreak 
of skin infections among wrestlers 
(‍herpes gladiatorum [HG]) and rugby 
players (‍herpes rugbiorum [HR]) 
on numerous occasions, affecting 
up to 2.6% of high school and 7.6% 
of college wrestlers in the United 
States.84 
– 
86 During outbreaks, up to 
34% of all high school wrestlers have 
been documented to be infected.87 
Risk factors for development of 
HG-related cutaneous HSV lesions 
include direct skin-to-skin exposure 
to opponents with cutaneous 
lesions.84 There is a range of 4 to 
11 days, with an average of 6.80 ± 
1.70 days from onset of exposure to 
development of skin lesions. Most 
outbreaks (‍96%) occur on the ventral 
surface of the body, with up to three-
quarters of the cases occurring 
on areas in direct contact when 
wrestlers are engaged in the lock-up 
position (‍head, face, and neck). Other 
body areas frequently involved are 
the extremities (‍42%) and trunk 
(‍28%).16 HSV conjunctivitis (‍5%) 
and blepharitis have also been 
reported.87 Between 25% and 40% 
of patients with HG and HR will 
develop constitutional symptoms 
including fever, chills, sore throat, 
and headaches.85, 
 
87 There are data 
associating acquired antibody to HSV 
type 1 infection with protection from 
acquiring HG, but the association is 
very weak.84
herpes outbreak and high-altitude 
skiing
High-altitude skiing also has been 
associated with relapses of orofacial 
herpes, presumably because of 
solar UV radiation exposure, with 
a median onset of 3.5 days after 
exposure (‍strong evidence).88 
Although sunscreen with a sun 
protection factor of 15 was shown 
to prevent experimental UV light-
induced reactivation of herpes 
labialis compared with placebo, 
89 it 
has not been shown to influence the 
reactivation rate among high-altitude 
skiers.88
management of hg and hr 
outbreaks
There is strong evidence that prompt 
identification and 3 to 8 days of 
isolation of infected wrestlers during 
primary outbreaks of HG and HR 
with suspension of competition 
can help contain outbreaks in more 
than 90% of cases.87, 
 
90, 
 
91 Diagnosis 
involves a combination of clinical 
recognition and may be coupled with 
cell culture, histologic examination, or 
rapid diagnostic tests such as direct 
fluorescent antibody staining, enzyme 
immunoassay, or polymerase chain

 reaction (‍PCR) of vesicular lesion 
scrapings in complex, lingering, or 
unclear cases.26 Valacyclovir, 500 
mg, every day or twice a day for 7 
days, when given within 24 hours 
of symptoms onset, has been shown 
to shorten the duration of time until 
HSV PCR clearance from lesions of 
adolescent and adult wrestlers with 
recurrent HG by 21% (‍from ∼8.1 
days with placebo to 6.4 days with 
valacyclovir).92 Wrestlers receiving 
valacyclovir should be advised about 
the importance of good hydration to 
minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity. 
Competitors often do not recognize 
or may deny possible infection. As a 
result, efforts to reduce transmission 
should include (‍1) examination of 
wrestlers and rugby players for 
vesicular or ulcerative lesions on 
exposed areas of their bodies and 
around their mouths or eyes before 
practice or competition by a person 
familiar with the appearance of 
mucocutaneous infections (‍including 
HSV, herpes zoster, and impetigo),  
(‍2) excluding athletes with these 
lesions from competition until all 
lesions are fully crusted or production 
of a physician’s written statement 
indicating that their condition is 
noninfectious, and (‍3) cleaning 
of wrestling mats with a freshly 
prepared solution of household 
bleach (‍1 quarter cup of bleach 
in 1 gallon of water) applied for a 
minimum contact time of 15 seconds 
at least daily and preferably between 
matches.26 NCAA, NFHS, and NATA 
guidelines for when the infected 
athlete can return to competition are 
summarized in Table 3.
Prevention of hg and hr outbreaks
Athletes with a history of recurrent 
HG, HR, or herpes labialis should 
be considered for suppressive 
antiviral therapy. There is strong 
evidence that nucleoside analogues 
(‍valacyclovir) can suppress recurrent 
outbreaks of herpes. In a study 
involving 42 male wrestlers aged 13 
to 31 years in Minnesota combining 
double-blind randomization 
followed by an open enrollment 
onto treatment, participants with 
recurrent HG were treated during 
the first half of the season with either 
500 mg of valacyclovir or placebo 
and in the second half with 1000 mg 
of valacyclovir. The 500 and 1000 mg  
doses of valacyclovir suppressed 
recurrence of outbreaks among 
100% (‍7 out of 7 and 12 out of 12) of 
participants whose last recurrence 
was more than 2 years before. 
However, the doses were slightly 
less successful among those with 
recurrences within 2 years (‍11 out 
of 14 and 23 out of 25, respectively), 
with better results with the 1000 mg 
dosing.93
Similarly, in a Minnesota study 
of 332 male wrestlers 13 to 20 
years of age who participated at a 
28-day wrestling camp, once-a-day 
prophylactic valacyclovir (‍1000 
mg) starting 1 week before camp 
and continuing throughout camp 
reduced the incidence of clinical 
HG outbreaks by 87%. Among 
55 of these wrestlers who were 
HSV type 1 immunoglobulin G 
seronegative at the beginning of the 
camp and had postcamp serologic 
testing performed, none developed 
detectable immunoglobulin M against 
HSV type 1 or HSV type 2.94 However, 
there is need for a detailed risk–
benefit analysis of using valacyclovir 
for prophylaxis in wrestlers who are 
seronegative for herpes.
molluscum contagiosum
Molluscum contagiosum is a 
common, benign viral skin infection 
presenting as skin-colored papules 
that develop a central umbilication 
as they age. Molluscum contagiosum 
affects 5% to 11% of children 
0 to 16 years of age95 and most 
commonly affects the trunk, face, and 
extremities. Molluscum contagiosum 
is mostly asymptomatic but may 
present with pain, itching, redness, or 
occasionally bacterial superinfection. 
Outbreaks of molluscum contagiosum 
have most often been described 
in association with exposure to 
swimming in public pools and 
underlying eczema.3, 
 
95 
–97 Other 
factors associated with infection 
include young age (‍highest incidence 
in children younger than 14 years), 
living in close proximity, skin-to-
skin contact, sharing of fomites, and 
residence in tropical climates.3, 
 
98
management of molluscum 
outbreaks
Resolution of uncomplicated 
molluscum contagiosum typically 
occurs spontaneously in 6 to 
12 months, although complete 
resolution of lesions can take up 
to 4 years. Although no regimen 
has proven highly successful, 
10% potassium hydroxide and 
cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen 
have been used to treat lesions 
that occur in locations that are 
cosmetically bothersome to 
patients or for patients with 
underlying skin conditions such as 
eczema. Both forms of treatment 
appear to have similar efficacy in 
children, but cryotherapy may be 
associated with postinflammatory 
hyperpigmentation or, uncommonly, 
scarring.99, 
 
100 Imiquimod was not 
shown to be of benefit compared 
with placebo in randomized 
controlled trials.101, 
 
102 Open-label 
and observational studies103, 
 
104 
indicate that cantharidin can be an 
effective treatment of molluscum 
contagiosum; however, in 1 small 
randomized controlled trial of 29 
patients, the improvement seen with 
cantharidin, although greater than 
with placebo, was not found to be 
statistically significant.100 Guidelines 
from the NCAA, NFHS, and NATA for 
when the infected athlete can return 
to competition for molluscum are 
summarized in Table 3.

Tinea Infections
T corporis and T capitis infections 
have been reported more 
frequently among high school 
wrestlers and judo practitioners  
(‍T corporis gladiatorum and T 
capitis gladiatorum) than among 
other athletes.8, 
 
105 
– 
112 Studies of the 
prevalence of T corporis gladiatorum 
have involved use of potassium 
hydroxide examination to aid 
diagnosis. In 1 such study, 24% of  
29 wrestlers had lesions of  
T corporis, versus 0 in a control  
group of track team members  
(‍P = .005).106 In another study,  
T corporis was detected in 10 of 19 
boys (‍53%) 15 to 17 years of age 
belonging to a judo club in Kyoto, 
Japan.112 The most common cause of 
T capitis gladiatorum is Trichophyton 
tonsurans, accounting for more than 
80% of cases, but it may also be 
caused by Trichophyton rubrum and 
Trichophyton mentagrophytes.113, 
 
114  
T tonsurans (‍primarily),  
T mentagrophytes, and  
Microsporum canis have also 
been isolated in high rates during 
outbreaks of T capitis (‍ringworm) 
among high school wrestlers in 
a wrestling boarding school in 
Turkey.109, 
115, 
 
116 These organisms 
have been isolated frequently from 
individual skin lesions and from 
wrestling mats.108, 
 
109
management of T Corporis and  
T Capitis outbreaks
Both skin-based and oral medications 
are available for the treatment of  
T corporis, but T capitis is managed 
exclusively with oral medications, 
often with simultaneous application 
of topical treatment to the scalp 
(‍because of the need for hair 
follicle penetration). Skin-based 
preparations for T corporis include 
but are not limited to azole 
creams (‍clotrimazole, econazole, 
ketoconazole, oxiconazole), 
allylamine creams and gels (‍1% 
gel of terbinafine and butenafine), 
and hydroxypyridone (‍ciclopirox) 
preparations. Although these all 
are reasonably effective, some 
preparations in some studies 
demonstrate superior cure rates. For 
example, terbinafine emulsion gel 
has a mycological cure rate superior 
to that of ketoconazole cream (‍94% 
versus 69%, respectively) with 
similar adverse events rates.117
Oral agents also have proven 
efficacious in the treatment of most 
cases of T corporis. Different doses 
and durations of itraconazole have 
been used in studies. Itraconazole, 
100 mg, given orally once a day, 
was superior to griseofulvin, 500 
mg, orally, once a day, when given 
for 15 days (‍87% mycological cure 
rate versus 57%, respectively, at the 
end of 2 weeks after completion of 
therapy) to adolescents and adults.118 
In contrast, 200 mg of itraconazole 
was found to be superior to 250 
mg of terbinafine when given for 7 
days respectively in terms of clinical 
response rates when administered to 
adolescents and adults.119
For T capitis, the traditional 
treatment in children had been oral 
griseofulvin, 10 mg/kg per day, 
microsize formulation, given once 
daily for 6 to 8 weeks, although 
doses of griseofulvin as high as 20 
to 25 mg/kg per day have been 
used.120 Terbinafine, 125 or 250 mg 
(‍adjusted for age), given for 2 to 8 
weeks, has recently been shown to 
have efficacy that is at least as good, 
with fewer adverse effects and fewer 
recurrences.116, 
 
121 
–123 Cochrane 
reviews have concluded that 4 weeks 
of terbinafine was equivalent to  
8 weeks of griseofulvin.124, 
 
125 
Similarly, oral fluconazole given for  
4 weeks had similar efficacy  
to oral griseofulvin given for  
6 weeks, 
126, 
 
127 although at least 1 
study revealed the efficacy to be low 
for both regimens.128 Itraconazole 
given for 2 weeks is also similar in 
efficacy to 6 weeks of griseofulvin, 
whereas terbinafine and itraconazole 
appear to have similar efficacy for 
treatment periods of 2 to 3 weeks.124 
However, terbinafine, itraconazole, 
and fluconazole are significantly 
more expensive than griseofulvin. 
Furthermore, griseofulvin appears to 
be superior for infections attributable 
to certain species of Microsporum, 
which may require 4 weeks’ 
duration or more of therapy with 
terbinafine and itraconazole.122, 
 
129, 
 
130 
Terbinafine appears superior for  
T tonsurans.125
Prevention of T Corporis and  
T Capitis outbreaks
Fluconazole, 100 mg per day for 
3 days, given prophylactically 
before initiation of competitive 
interscholastic high school wrestling 
and given again 6 weeks into 
the season, has been reported to 
significantly reduce the incidence 
of T corporis from 67.4% to 3.5%.30 
However, the risk-benefit analysis of 
giving fluconazole prophylactically 
in this manner has not been 
determined, and its use should be 
in consultation with an infectious 
diseases expert.
T Pedis
T pedis (‍athlete’s foot) presents 
as a fine scaly or vesiculopustular 
eruption that is often itchy. The 
lesions may involve all areas of 
the foot but commonly include the 
fissures and scaling between toes. 
Increased rates of T pedis have been 
well documented and common 
among swimmers and runners 
(‍especially marathon runners), 
with documented infections in up to 
22%. The predominant causes are 
T rubrum and T mentagrophytes.131 
Spread via direct contact with the 
organism, T pedis is prevalent in 
warm, humid environments and 
affects men more than women.132

 Obesity and diabetes are additional 
risk factors for T pedis.133
management of T Pedis outbreaks
Numerous treatments (‍creams 
and oral medications) have been 
evaluated for treating T pedis. 
In randomized controlled trials 
in adults, ciclopirox olamine (‍a 
broad-spectrum hydroxypyridone 
antifungal with proven efficacy 
against T rubrum, T mentagrophytes, 
and Epidermophyton floccosum) 
cream or gel (‍0.77%) applied twice 
daily to the affected areas for 4 weeks 
has been shown to be effective in 
eradicating T pedis and superior to 
1% clotrimazole cream or ciclopirox 
vehicle in achieving both clinical 
and mycological cure (‍∼60% for 
cyclopirox olamine cream versus 
6% for its vehicle only at end of 
treatment, and 85% versus 16% two 
weeks after treatment).134, 
 
135 There 
are no published studies of use of 
ciclopirox to treat T pedis in children, 
but a dosage of topical application 
twice a day is recommended for use 
in children older than 10 years.28 
Similarly, naftifine ointment 
applied twice daily for 4 weeks and 
sulconazole nitrate 1% cream applied 
daily for 4 to 6 weeks have been 
associated with significantly higher 
mycological clearance rates (‍57%–
66%) compared with their vehicles 
alone (‍13%–34% cleared) and were 
associated with fewer relapses in 
treatment of T rubrum–related T 
pedis.136, 
137 However, sulconazole 
is not approved for use in children 
in the United States. More recently, 
topical azoles such as fenticonazole 
powder have been used in adults 
with up to 100% cure rates.138 
Terbinafine 1% cream applied 
daily for 1 week also has been used 
effectively to treat T pedis, with >93% 
mycological cure rate at 4 weeks, and 
is approved for children 12 years and 
older.139 Luliconazole was recently 
reported as a 1% cream trial for  
T pedis in adults, but less than 50% of 
the participants were cured on this 
regimen.140 It is only approved by the 
US Food and Drug Administration for 
use in adults.
Terbinafine offers the advantage of 
once-daily dosing and can be given 
for briefer periods than skin-based 
treatments. Oral terbinafine, 250 mg, 
given once daily for 1 week,  
has similar efficacy (‍based on 
mycological cure rates at week 4)  
to 4 weeks of clotrimazole 1% 
cream applied twice a day but with 
faster clinical resolution.141 Oral 
terbinafine, 250 mg, also is similar in 
mycological efficacy to itraconazole, 
100 mg, when given over a 2-week 
duration but may have a slightly 
lower rate of relapse. Terbinafine is 
well tolerated in children, with the 
most concerning potential adverse 
events being occasional isolated 
neutropenia and rare liver failure, 
typically in people with preexisting 
liver disease.
Prevention of T Pedis outbreaks
The use of foot powder after bathing 
has been associated with a decline 
in the rates of T pedis in a random 
sampling of users of a swimming 
bath in Scotland from 8.5% to 2.1% 
over a 3.5-year period, 
142 mostly 
attributable to the decline in rates of 
T mentagrophytes from 5.3% to 0.5%. 
Experts believe that careful and 
thorough drying between the toes 
after showers, daily changes of socks, 
and periodic cleaning of athletic 
footwear can be helpful.
T Cruris
T cruris (‍jock itch or crotch rot) is a 
common pruritic fungal infection of 
the groin and adjacent skin.133 Heat, 
humidity, and hyperhidrosis are 
predisposing factors, as is wearing of 
tight-fitting or wet clothing. Similar 
to T pedis, obesity and diabetes are 
additional risk factors for T cruris.133
The predominant cause is T rubrum 
followed by E floccosum and T 
mentagrophytes.143, 
 
144 It may be 
spread by contaminated fomites 
(‍contaminated towels, hotel 
bed sheets) or autoinoculation 
from hands or feet infected with 
Tinea from another body site 
(‍Tinea unguium, T pedis, or Tinea 
manuum).133
management of T Cruris Infection
Similar to T pedis, terbinafine 1% 
cream applied daily for 1 week has 
been used effectively to treat  
T cruris with a mycological cure rate of 
approximately 94% and is approved 
for children 12 years and older.117 
Butenafine (‍a benzylamine derivative 
of clotrimazole) applied twice daily 
for 2 weeks and clotrimazole applied 
twice weekly for 4 weeks are also 
over-the-counter alternatives, but 
butenafine is only approved in 
adults.145 
–148 Oral itraconazole  
(‍100 mg daily for 2 weeks or 200 mg  
daily for 1 week) has been shown 
to be effective in adults for treating 
T cruris and superior to oral 
griseofulvin (‍500 mg daily for  
2 weeks).118, 
 
149, 
 
150 Several other azole 
topical formulations (‍oxiconazole, 
151  
luliconazole, 
151 sertaconazole, 
144 
eberconazole152) have been shown to 
be effective in adults, but none have 
been studied in any detail in children.
Prevention of T Cruris Infection
Because of risk of spread from 
T pedis, covering active foot 
lesions with socks before wearing 
undershorts may reduce the 
likelihood of direct contamination. 
Furthermore, complete drying of the 
crural folds after bathing, and use of 
separate (‍clean) towels for drying 
the groin and other parts of the body 
may help reduce contamination.
Verruca Vulgaris
Verruca vulgaris (‍common skin 
warts) are benign epithelial 
proliferations of the skin and are 
caused by human papillomaviruses. 
They are typically painless, multiple 
in number, and occur on any 
epithelial surface, although most 
commonly on the hands, feet, and 
around and under the nails.33 They

 may be distinguished from calluses 
and corns by the presence of black 
dots (‍clotted blood vessels that have 
grown into the wart) when they are 
pared down as well as the associated 
loss of overlying dermatoglyphs. 
Although reports indicate that warts 
may occur in outbreaks among 
athletes, there are no published data 
on the prevalence. Reported risk 
factors appear to include sharing of 
equipment and exposure of unshod 
feet in common shower areas.34 In a 
study of 146 adolescents who used 
locker rooms, 27% of those who used 
communal showers on a regular basis 
were found to have plantar warts 
versus only 1.25% of those who only 
used the locker rooms.34 However, 
because the children using communal 
showers were also members of a 
swim club, it is unclear whether the 
communal shower or the swimming 
was the major contributing factor.
management of Verruca Vulgaris 
Infections
Most cases of common warts will 
eventually spontaneously regress, 
with 30% regressing within 6 months 
and approximately 60% within 2 
years. Treatment modalities are 
usually geared toward chemical or 
physical destruction of the infected 
epithelium and include techniques 
such as freezing with liquid nitrogen, 
application of salicylic acid-based 
products or tretinoin (‍retinoic 
acid) cream, surgical (‍paring) or 
laser removal, and use of topical 
immunomodulating agents.34 The 
more destructive methods may lead 
to pain, which may inhibit athletic 
activity. More recently, cantharidin 
combined with podophyllotoxin-
salicylic acid has been used in 
adults and reported to be effective 
but associated with pain and 
blistering.153, 
 
154
Prevention of Verruca Vulgaris 
Infections
Precise mechanisms of preventing 
common warts are unknown. 
However, like most infections that 
are transmitted by contact, avoidance 
of contact with people known to 
have common warts, not sharing 
equipment and towels, and wearing 
rubber soled flip-flops or sandals in 
communal showers may minimize 
risk.
scabies and lice
Scabies (‍caused by Sarcoptes scabiei) 
and lice (‍P capitis), although not 
commonly reported in sports, can 
be disqualifying if identified in 
children participating in organized, 
especially contact, sports. They 
are transmitted primarily through 
person-to-person contact. The 
scabies parasite can survive on 
clothing for up to 4 days without skin 
contact.35 Lice do not survive away 
from the scalp more than 1 to 2 days 
without a blood meal, and although 
uncommon, can be transmitted by 
hair brushes, combs, hats, and hair 
ornaments.37 The transmission, 
risk factors, recognition, diagnosis, 
treatment, and prevention are 
summarized in Table 2. Successful 
treatment of scabies can be achieved 
topically with permethrin 5% 
cream or oral ivermectin (‍not for 
pregnant women), but resistance 
has been reported to both.155, 
156 
Pregnant women and infants may be 
treated with topical crotamiton or 
precipitated sulfur ointment. Head 
lice treatment requires attention 
not only to the live lice but also to 
eggs that may subsequently hatch. 
Treatment of head lice can be 
started with over-the-counter 1% 
permethrin lotion or with pyrethrin 
combined with piperonyl butoxide, 
both of which have good safety 
profiles.36 Resistance to these over-
the-counter agents is commonplace 
in many parts of the United States, 
and as such, alternative Food and 
Drug Administration–approved 
treatments may be necessary. For 
lice resistant to over-the-counter 
medications, treatment options 
include spinosad suspension, 
benzyl alcohol lotion, malathion, 
or ivermectin lotion. Spinosad 
and ivermectin lotion are ovicidal, 
and a single treatment may be 
adequate, but no treatment is 100% 
ovicidal.155, 
 
156 Suffocant treatments, 
such as benzyl alcohol lotion or 
malathion lotion, require retreatment 
approximately 1 week later to kill any 
new lice that hatched from nits. For 
lice resistant to all topical agents, oral 
ivermectin in a single dose of 200 
or 400 μg/kg may be used in infants 
weighing over 15 kg, with a second 
dose given after 9 to 10 days.36

Varicella-Zoster Virus
Although varicella has been reported 
as a cause of airborne sports-related 
infections, 
157 such reports are rare 
in the era of immunization with 
the live attenuated vaccine against 
the virus. The varicella-zoster 
virus (‍VZV) manifests primarily as 
a generalized, pruritic, vesicular 
rash consisting of 250 to 500 
lesions in different stages (‍crops) 
of development and crusting.39 
There is usually an associated low-
grade fever, and there may be other 
systemic symptoms. Disease in 
vaccinated children is often milder 
and atypical in nature compared with 
the wild virus infection and requires 
a high index of suspicion. Diagnosis 
is usually made on the basis of a 
typical clinical picture coupled with 
history of exposure, but vesicular 
fluid or scab scraping can be used 
for confirmation by using PCR, direct 
fluorescent antibody assay, or VZV-
specific culture. A significant increase 
in serum varicella immunoglobulin 
G antibody between acute and 
convalescent serum samples can also 
assist in diagnosis.
management of VZV Infections
Isolation should be instituted for 
those suspected to have chickenpox 
until the diagnosis is either ruled 
out or all the lesions are crusted

 over or in vaccinated children when 
there are no new lesions within a 
24-hour period.39 Oral acyclovir 
or valacyclovir given within 24 
hours of rash onset results in only a 
modest decrease in symptoms and 
is not routinely recommended for 
most healthy children. It should be 
considered in otherwise healthy 
children who are at increased risk 
of moderate to severe varicella, 
including people older than 12 years, 
people with chronic cutaneous 
or pulmonary disorders, those 
receiving long-term salicylate 
therapy, and those on short, 
intermittent, or aerosolized courses 
of corticosteroids.39
Prevention of VZV Infections
The most effective proven means 
of preventing VZV is via primary 
immunization with the live 
attenuated vaccine.39 Children 
exposed to VZV should have their 
immunity evaluated, either through 
vaccination records or through 
serologic testing.
measles
Measles is characterized by a 
prodrome of cough, coryza, and 
conjunctivitis with fever followed by 
maculopapular or morbilliform rash 
that begins on the face and spreads 
downward to the trunk and out to 
the extremities. Koplik spots, which 
are considered pathognomonic, 
also appear during the prodrome.40 
Patients are contagious 4 days before 
the rash to 4 days after the rash 
appears. Measles outbreaks have 
been reported during many different 
types of sporting events ranging  
from gymnastics to skiing and 
fencing, 
158 
– 
163 highlighting the 
importance of adequate vaccination 
of all athletes. Up to 5% of people 
who have received a single dose of 
vaccine at 12 months or older have 
vaccine failure. Among previously 
immunized people, primary vaccine 
failure (‍inadequate response to 
vaccine) is a more common cause of 
failure than waning immunity. As a 
result, the current recommendations 
call for a 2-dose vaccine schedule for 
children and high-risk adults.40
mumps
Mumps is a systemic illness that 
presents with swelling of 1 or more 
of the salivary glands, typically the 
parotid glands. Up to one-third of 
mumps cases do not cause salivary 
gland swelling, presenting instead 
as a respiratory tract infection. 
Orchitis is a common complication 
after puberty, but it rarely leads 
to sterility. Approximately 10% of 
patients have an associated viral 
meningitis, and numerous other 
complications occur rarely, including 
permanent hearing loss, myocarditis, 
endocardial fibroelastosis, arthritis, 
thrombocytopenia, thyroiditis, 
mastitis, glomerulonephritis, 
pancreatitis, and oophoritis. The 
virus has been isolated from saliva 
from 7 days before through 8 
days after onset of salivary gland 
swelling. Before introduction 
of mumps vaccine, outbreaks 
of mumps were common in the 
United States, primarily in crowded 
settings including schools, prisons, 
orphanages, and military facilities. 
Although the incidence of the disease 
has declined significantly with the 
introduction of the 2-dose schedule 
of the measles-mumps-rubella 
(‍MMR) vaccine, outbreaks still 
periodically occur, primarily because 
of incomplete vaccination.
management of measles and mumps 
outbreaks
Immunization is the cornerstone 
of managing measles and mumps 
outbreaks. All suspected cases 
of measles or mumps should be 
reported immediately, and every 
effort should be made for laboratory 
confirmation of the infection either 
through serologic testing or detection 
of virus from clinical specimens 
(‍throat washings, nasopharyngeal 
secretions, urine, and blood for 
measles and buccal swabs, throat 
washings, saliva, or cerebrospinal 
fluid, if relevant, for mumps). In an 
outbreak setting, the MMR vaccine 
should be given to all people  
(‍>12 months) who lack evidence 
of immunity. For mumps, a second 
MMR dose should be offered to 
all students (‍including those in 
postsecondary school) who have 
received only 1 dose of MMR vaccine. 
A second MMR dose should also be 
considered for both conditions in 
children 1 to 4 years of age if they 
have only received 1 dose and there 
is an ongoing outbreak affecting 
preschool-aged children with 
community-wide transmission.40
Prevention of measles and mumps 
outbreaks
The most important method to 
prevent measles and mumps 
outbreaks is routine immunization 
of all children with a live attenuated 
vaccine, such as MMR or MMR-
varicella vaccine, at age 12 through 
15 months, with a second dose at 4 
to 6 years of age, and people who 
are not documented to have been 
vaccinated during these periods.40 
People who have altered immunity 
(‍except HIV infection, unless they 
have severe immunosuppression) 
should not receive MMR vaccine. 
Furthermore, MMR-varicella vaccine 
should not be given to patients with 
HIV (‍even if these people have little 
to no immune compromise) because 
of a lack of safety data at the present 
time.
The epidemiology and outbreak 
control considerations for other 
conditions primarily transmitted via 
droplet and contaminated food and 
water are summarized in Table 2.
