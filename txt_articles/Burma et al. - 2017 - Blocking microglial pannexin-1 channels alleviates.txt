Opiates are essential for treating pain, but termination of 
opiate therapy can cause a debilitating withdrawal syndrome 
in chronic users. To alleviate or avoid the aversive symptoms 
of withdrawal, many of these individuals continue to use 
opiates1–4. Withdrawal is therefore a key determinant of opiate 
use in dependent individuals, yet its underlying mechanisms 
are poorly understood and effective therapies are lacking. Here, 
we identify the pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel as a therapeutic 
target in opiate withdrawal. We show that withdrawal from 
morphine induces long-term synaptic facilitation in lamina I 
and II neurons within the rodent spinal dorsal horn, a principal 
site of action for opiate analgesia. Genetic ablation of Panx1 
in microglia abolished the spinal synaptic facilitation and 
ameliorated the sequelae of morphine withdrawal. Panx1  
is unique in its permeability to molecules up to 1 kDa in size 
and its release of ATP5,6. We show that Panx1 activation 
drives ATP release from microglia during morphine withdrawal 
and that degrading endogenous spinal ATP by administering 
apyrase produces a reduction in withdrawal behaviors. 
Conversely, we found that pharmacological inhibition of 
ATP breakdown exacerbates withdrawal. Treatment with 
a Panx1-blocking peptide (10panx) or the clinically used 
broad-spectrum Panx1 blockers, mefloquine or probenecid, 
suppressed ATP release and reduced withdrawal severity. 
Our results demonstrate that Panx1-mediated ATP release 
from microglia is required for morphine withdrawal in rodents 
and that blocking Panx1 alleviates the severity of withdrawal 
without affecting opiate analgesia. 
We investigated the mechanisms underlying opiate withdrawal by 
administering an opioid receptor antagonist (naloxone, 2 mg per 
kg body weight (mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.)) to rats chronically 
treated for 5 d with systemic morphine sulfate (MS, Supplementary 
Fig. 1a). Naloxone administration precipitated a spectrum of 
 
autonomic and somatic withdrawal signs in morphine- but not 
saline-treated rats (Supplementary Fig. 1b), the overall severity of 
which was expressed as a cumulative withdrawal score (Fig. 1a). In 
morphine-treated rats, CD11b immunoreactivity was significantly 
elevated within the spinal dorsal horn, indicating that spinal microglia 
are activated by morphine treatment (Fig. 1b and Supplementary 
Fig. 2). Depletion of spinal lumbar microglia by intrathecal injec-
tions of a saporin (Sap)-conjugated antibody to Mac1 (Mac1–Sap; 
20 µg) decreased withdrawal behaviors (Supplementary Fig. 1b) 
and attenuated the severity of withdrawal (Fig. 1a) without affecting 
morphine antinociception (Fig. 1c). By contrast, intrathecal injec-
tion of a nontargeting Sap (20 µg) control had no effect on spinal 
CD11b immunoreactivity (Fig. 1b) or naloxone-induced morphine 
withdrawal (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
In the central nervous system, Panx1 channels are expressed on 
neurons and glia7,8. Flow cytometric analysis of adult lumbar spi-
nal cord homogenates revealed that morphine treatment resulted in 
elevated Panx1 expression on CD11b-positive cells (i.e., microglia) 
but not CD11b-negative cells (i.e., neurons and astrocytes) (Fig. 1d 
and Supplementary Fig. 3). We acutely isolated CD11b-positive cells 
from the spinal cord of morphine- or saline-treated rats and assessed 
Panx1 channel function by measuring BzATP-evoked uptake of YO-
PRO-1 dye, an indicator of Panx1 channel activation9,10. YO-PRO-1 
uptake was significantly greater in CD11b-positive cells isolated from 
morphine-treated rats (Fig. 1e). This response was blocked by 10panx 
 
(10 µM)5,11 but was not affected by a scrambled peptide (scrpanx) 
 
(Fig. 1e). Both the increase in Panx1 protein expression 
(Supplementary Fig. 4a) and YO-PRO-1 uptake (Fig. 1f) were reca-
pitulated in a BV-2 microglial-like cell line12 exposed to morphine 
for 5 d in vitro. Dye uptake was further potentiated in the presence of 
naloxone (10 µM) (Fig. 1f) and blocked by 10panx (10 µM) (Fig. 1g). 
 
Application of extracellular solution (ECS) as a vehicle control for 
BzATP did not evoke dye uptake (Fig. 1f). Moreover, treatment of 
cultured BV-2 cells with morphine and CTAP (a selective µ-receptor

antagonist) together prevented the increase in Panx1 expression and 
function (Supplementary Fig. 4a,c), whereas repeated administration 
of the synthetic µ-receptor agonist peptide DAMGO mimicked the 
effects of morphine on Panx1 (Supplementary Fig. 4b,d).
The observation that naloxone potentiates Panx1 activity in mor-
phine-treated microglia led us to examine whether microglial Panx1 
channels might contribute to naloxone-induced morphine withdrawal 
behaviors. We tested this possibility by intrathecally administering 
10panx (10 µg) to morphine-treated rats 60 min before naloxone 
challenge and found significantly lower withdrawal scores than in 
morphine-treated rats injected with scrpanx (Fig. 2a). To determine 
whether the requisite Panx1 is expressed on microglia, we created 
transgenic mice with a tamoxifen-dependent deletion of Panx1 in 
cells expressing the chemokine C-X3-C motif receptor CX3CR1 
(Cx3cr1-CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx). We confirmed in the lumbar spinal 
cord that the CreERT2 reporter eYFP was localized to CD11b-positive 
cells (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and that there was a microglia-specific 
 
reduction in Panx1 expression in tamoxifen-treated Cx3cr1-
CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx mice (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Performance 
in the accelerating rotarod test was not altered in these microglial 
Panx1-deficient mice (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Spinal microglia iso-
lated from adult microglial Panx1-deficient mice (7 d after tamoxifen 
injection in Cx3cr1-CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx) showed impaired YO-PRO-3 
uptake (Supplementary Fig. 5d) but normal P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) 
function as measured by BzATP-evoked Ca2+  influx (Supplementary 
Fig. 5e). Morphine antinociception and morphine-induced spinal 
microglial reactivity remained notably intact in Panx1-deficient mice 
(Fig. 2b,c). However, when challenged with naloxone after morphine 
treatment, Panx1-deficient mice showed a significantly lower with-
drawal score than morphine-treated Panx1-expressing mice (litter-
mate vehicle-injected Cx3cr1-CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx mice) (Fig. 2d and 
Supplementary Fig. 6).
Cell turnover rates differ between central and peripheral CX3CR1-
expressing populations13. Therefore, in another cohort of Cx3cr1-
CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx mice, morphine injections were initiated 28 d 
after tamoxifen treatment to allow for repopulation of peripheral but 
not central CX3CR1-expressing cells. In this cohort of Panx1-deficient 
mice, the reduction in morphine withdrawal was comparable to that

observed in mice receiving morphine injections 7 d after tamoxifen 
treatment (Fig. 2d), suggesting that Panx1 on microglia, not periph-
eral CX3CR1-expressing cells, is required for morphine withdrawal. 
Furthermore, morphine withdrawal was attenuated in both male and 
female Panx1-deficient mice (Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating that 
microglial Panx1 critically contributes to opiate withdrawal in both 
sexes. As another control, we administered tamoxifen to mice lacking 
inducible Cre recombinase (Panx1flx/flx) and found that the sever-
ity of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal was indistinguishable from 
vehicle-treated Panx1-expressing mice (Cx3cr1-CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx) 
(Fig. 2d). Thus, tamoxifen per se does not affect morphine with-
drawal. To further investigate the requirement for microglial Panx1 
in morphine withdrawal, we compared the actions of 10panx (10 µg) 
in Panx1-deficient and Panx1-expressing mice. We reasoned that if 
the effects of 10panx were mediated by blocking Panx1 on microglia, 
 
they would be lost in the absence of microglial Panx1. Indeed, intrath-
ecal injection of 10panx before naloxone challenge significantly 
attenuated morphine withdrawal in Panx1-expressing mice (Fig. 2e) 
but did not further ameliorate withdrawal in Panx1-deficient mice 
(Fig. 2e). This loss of 10panx effect, together with the amelioration of 
withdrawal in Panx1-deficient mice, implicates microglial Panx1 in 
morphine withdrawal.
To investigate the mechanisms underlying Panx1-mediated with-
drawal, we first measured spinal cFos expression as a cellular correlate 
of neuronal activation14. We determined that naloxone-precipitated 
withdrawal increased the number of cFos-positive neurons within the 
spinal dorsal horn of Panx1-expressing mice; this increase was sup-
pressed in mice lacking microglial Panx1 (Fig. 3a). To assess neuronal 
function more directly, we used a whole lumbar spinal cord prepara-
tion with intact dorsal roots15 prepared from Panx1-expressing or 
microglial Panx1-deficient adult mice that had been treated for 5 d 
with saline or morphine. We electrically stimulated the dorsal root to

evoke postsynaptic field potentials (fPSPs) recorded from laminae I–II 
of the spinal dorsal horn and found that bath application of naloxone 
(10 µM) produced a slow-rising facilitation of fPSPs that persisted for 
at least 60 min in morphine- but not saline-treated Panx1-expressing 
mice (Fig. 3b,c). By contrast, this response to naloxone did not occur 
in morphine-treated Panx1-deficient mice (Fig. 3b,c). The absence 
of synaptic facilitation in these mutant mice was not due to a general 
defect in spinal synaptic facilitation, because electrically stimulating 
the dorsal roots of Panx1-deficient mice at low frequency (2 Hz) pro-
duced a robust and long-lasting increase in fPSPs (Fig. 3d,e).
Because ATP release is a key consequence of Panx1 activation6,16, 
we asked whether Panx1-mediated ATP release occurs during with-
drawal. To test this, we bath-applied naloxone (10 µM) to spinal 
 
cord slices isolated from Panx1-expressing and Panx1-deficient 
mice that had been treated for 5 d with saline or morphine. We mea-
sured the amount of ATP in spinal superfusates and found that the 
level of ATP in response to naloxone was significantly higher in 
morphine- than in saline-treated Panx1-expressing mice (Fig. 4a). 
Naloxone-induced ATP release was not observed in slices prepared 
from Panx1-deficient mice (Fig. 4a). To test whether ATP is directly 
released from microglia, we applied naloxone to microglia in culture. 
Supernatants of morphine-treated microglia showed increase in ATP, 
and this increase was blocked by 10panx (Fig. 4b). Thus, naloxone 
induces the release of ATP from morphine-treated microglia via a 
Panx1-dependent mechanism.
To test whether ATP contributes to morphine withdrawal, 
 
we administered ATPγS (100 µM) intrathecally to Panx1-deficient 
mice, which display attenuated morphine withdrawal behaviors. 
 
In these mice, local delivery of the ATP analog together with naloxone 
challenge restored a spectrum of withdrawal behaviors; these 
 
behaviors were not observed when ATPγS was administered to 
saline-treated Panx1-deficient mice (Fig. 4c). We reasoned that if 
ATP is required for morphine withdrawal, then altering endogenously 
released ATP in the spinal cord might influence withdrawal behav-
iors. In morphine-treated rats, we tested this possibility by intrathecal 
administration of the ATP-degrading enzyme apyrase (10 units)17, 
which produced a notable reduction in withdrawal score (Fig. 4d). 
Conversely, inhibiting ATP breakdown by intrathecally administering

the ecto-ATPase inhibitor ARL67156 (10 nmol)18,19 exacerbated 
morphine withdrawal (Fig. 4d). We therefore conclude that ATP is 
 
a key substrate for morphine withdrawal.
P2X7R activation is a core mechanism for opening Panx1 chan-
nels5,10. We determined that P2X7R expression was selectively 
increased in spinal microglia isolated from morphine-dependent rats 
(Supplementary Fig. 8a), and blockade of these receptors by intrathe-
cal administration of the selective P2X7R antagonist A-740003 attenu-
ated withdrawal (Supplementary Fig. 8b). These findings position 
P2X7R as an upstream signaling node through which morphine 
potentiates Panx1 function, defining P2X7R–Panx1 as a microglial 
signaling ensemble required for morphine withdrawal. Specifically 
targeting Panx1 while leaving P2X7R function intact could, however, 
be the preferred strategy for treating opiate withdrawal.
Having established that Panx1 is crucially involved in morphine 
withdrawal, we tested as proof of concept two clinically used broad-
spectrum Panx1 inhibitors: probenecid, an anti-gout medication20, and 
mefloquine, an antimalarial drug21. In morphine-treated rats, systemic 
administration of probenecid or mefloquine 60 min before naloxone 
challenge significantly ameliorated morphine withdrawal (Fig. 4e 
and Supplementary Fig. 9a). These compounds also blocked BzATP-
evoked potentiation of Panx1 activation (Fig. 4f and Supplementary 
Fig. 9b) and suppressed ATP release in morphine-treated microglia 
cultures (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 9c) without altering P2X7R-
mediated calcium responses (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b).
To further extend the potential clinical utility of probenecid, we 
tested the actions of this compound in a model of spontaneous mor-
phine withdrawal that does not rely on naloxone challenge. Mice 
given a 5-d morphine treatment showed robust withdrawal behav-
iors 24 h after morphine cessation, and these behaviors were attenu-
ated by a systemic injection of probenecid (50 mg/kg, i.p.) (Fig. 4h). 
 
Spontaneous withdrawal was also reduced in Panx1-deficient mice 
(Fig. 4i), suggesting a common microglial Panx1-dependent mecha-
nism in both naloxone-precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal. 
Finally, we investigated the effects of probenecid on fentanyl, another 
clinically used and widely abused opioid. In fentanyl-treated mice, 
naloxone precipitated robust withdrawal that was ameliorated by 
probenecid (Fig. 4j). Taken together, the effects of probenecid and 
mefloquine in alleviating opiate withdrawal open the possibility that 
these, and other clinically available broad-spectrum Panx1 inhibitors, 
have potential application in the treatment of opiate withdrawal.
In summary, we have discovered that a substrate within the spinal 
cord—microglial Panx1-mediated ATP release—underlies the cel-
lular and behavioral correlates of morphine withdrawal. We propose 
that Panx1 activation is a fundamental mechanism through which 
microglia cause long-term synaptic facilitation in spinal lamina I–II 
neurons during withdrawal. This form of neuronal hyperexcitability 
is a cardinal feature of withdrawal14,22, and we demonstrate here that 
this central tenet of withdrawal occurs directly in the spinal cord of 
morphine-treated animals. Because opiate withdrawal engages both 
spinal and supraspinal mechanisms, including the periaqueductal 
gray14, locus coeruleus23, ventral tegmental area24–26 and nucleus 
accumbens27, descending inputs from these supraspinal regions 
may influence spinal facilitation in the intact system. However, our 
isolated spinal cord preparation suggests that intrinsic spinal mecha-
nisms are sufficient for synaptic facilitation during withdrawal, and as 
further evidence for a spinal locus of opiate action, we show that spi-
nal manipulations targeting Panx1 channels or ATP levels effectively 
block or recapitulate the behavioral and cellular corollaries of with-
drawal. Although we do not rule out contributions from supraspinal 
mechanisms, the potent alleviation of opiate withdrawal by clinically 
used Panx1-blocking drugs (probenecid and mefloquine) highlights 
the potential of our findings for immediate therapeutic translation. 
Targeting Panx1 channels may therefore represent a new clinical 
 
strategy for alleviating withdrawal symptoms without impairing 
 
morphine analgesia.

Animals. Adult male rats and mice were used (rats aged 7–8 weeks; mice aged 
8–12 weeks for behavioral experiments and 6–10 weeks for electrophysiology 
experiments). Mice and rats were housed under a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle 
with ad libitum access to food and water and were randomly allocated to dif-
ferent test groups. All experiments were approved by the University of Calgary, 
Université Laval and University of California Irvine Animal Care Committees 
and are in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal 
Care and the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care of Use of 
Laboratory Animals.
Morphine dosing paradigm and nociceptive behavioral models. Morphine 
sulfate (PCCA) prepared in 0.9% sterile saline solution was injected i.p. twice 
daily (8 a.m. and 5 p.m.) into male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight ranging 
 
200–250 g, escalating doses from 10 to 45 mg/kg)28, C57BL/6 mice, male and 
female Cx3cr1-CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx or Panx1flx/flx mice (weight ranging 16–30 g, 
 
escalating doses from 7.5 to 50 mg/kg). Thermal nociceptive thresholds were 
assessed using the tail-flick test (rats) and the tail-immersion test (mice). For 
rats, an infrared thermal stimulus (Ugo Basile) was applied to the ventral 
surface of the tail, and time latency for tail removal from the stimulus was 
recorded. For mice, the distal portion of the tail was submerged in a 50 °C 
water bath, and time latency for tail removal from the stimulus was recorded. 
A maximum cutoff time was set at 10 s to prevent tissue damage. Nociceptive 
measurements were taken before and 30 min after morphine injections, and 
values were normalized to daily baseline. In a subset of mouse experiments, a 
time course of morphine-induced antinociception was performed at 30, 45, 60, 
90 and 120 min after a single acute injection of morphine (7.5 mg/kg).
Behavioral assessment of morphine withdrawal. Rats and mice received 
ascending doses of morphine i.p. at 8-h intervals (rats: day 1, 10 mg/kg; day 2, 
 
20 mg/kg; day 3, 30 mg/kg; day 4, 40 mg/kg; mice: day 1, 7.5 and 15 mg/kg; day 2, 
 
20 and 25 mg/kg; day 3, 30 and 35 mg/kg; day 4, 40 and 45 mg/kg). On day 5, 
rats and mice received a morning injection of morphine (rats, 45 mg/kg; mice, 
50 mg/kg) and 2 h later naloxone (2 mg/kg, naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate, 
Sigma) to rapidly induce opiate withdrawal. Control rats and mice received 
equivalent volumes of 0.9% saline and were challenged with naloxone on day 
5. Signs of withdrawal were recorded as previously described29. Jumping, teeth 
chattering, wet-dog shakes, headshakes and grooming behaviors were evalu-
ated at 5-min intervals for a total test period of 30 min, and a standardized 
score of 0 to 3 was assigned to each behavior. Allodynia, piloerection, saliva-
tion, ejaculation and tremors or twitching were also evaluated, with 1 point 
given to the presence of the behavior during each 5-min interval. All signs were 
counted and compiled to yield a cumulative withdrawal score. Rats and mice 
were weighed before and after naloxone challenge to calculate weight loss. In 
all behavioral studies, experimenters were blind to the drug treatment group 
and genetic profile of rats and mice. In a subset of experiments, spontaneous 
withdrawal behaviors were assessed in mice 24 h after last morphine or control 
injection (on day 6).
Intrathecal drug administration. In a subset of experiments, rats and 
 
mice were subject to drug administration by intrathecal injection under 2%  
isoflurane (vol/vol) by lumbar puncture method as previously described30. 
Mac1–Sap or Sap (20 µg, Advanced Targeting Systems) was injected on days 1 and 
3 before morning morphine injections. Intrathecal injections of 10panx (10 µg, 
WRQAAFVDSY, New England Peptide), scrpanx (10 µg, FSVYWAQADR, 
New England Peptide) and A-740003 (10 µL of 10 µM, Sigma) were deliv-
ered 60 min before naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, and intrathecal apyrase 
 
(10 units, Sigma) and ARL67156 (10 nmol, Sigma) were delivered 15 min 
before naloxone. ATPγS (100 µM, Roche) was delivered intrathecally imme-
diately before naloxone-precipitated withdrawal without the use of isoflu-
rane. All control animals received an equivalent volume of intrathecal 0.9% 
sterile saline on a timeline identical  to that used for treated animals from the 
 
same experiment.
Systemic drug administration. Morphine-dependent rats received systemic 
mefloquine (45 mg/kg i.p., Sigma; or 20 mg/kg i.p., Bioblocks) or probenecid 
(50 mg/kg i.p., Sigma) 60 min before naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. In the 
spontaneous withdrawal experiments, mice received probenecid (50 mg/kg 
i.p., Sigma) 23 h after the last morphine or control injection (60 min before 
assessment of spontaneous withdrawal) on day 6. In the fentanyl withdrawal 
experiments, mice received probenecid (50 mg/kg i.p., Sigma) 10 min after 
last fentanyl injection and 20 min before naloxone-precipitated withdrawal on 
day 7. Both mefloquine and probenecid were reconstituted in β-cyclodextrin 
(Sigma), and control animals received systemic β-cyclodextrin.
Assessment of sensorimotor coordination. Sensorimotor coordination was 
evaluated using the accelerating rotarod test (Panlab, Harvard Apparatus). 
All mice underwent two conditioning trials before testing. Motor behavior 
was analyzed 7 d after last tamoxifen or vehicle injection. In brief, mice were 
placed on a rotating rod set to gradually accelerate from 4 to 40 r.p.m. over 
 
5 min. The trial was terminated when the mouse fell off the apparatus, and 
both time and terminal speed (r.p.m.) were recorded.
Behavioral assessment of fentanyl withdrawal. Fentanyl citrate (West Ward 
Pharmaceuticals) prepared in 0.9% sterile saline solution was injected i.p. at 
ascending doses (day 1, 5 and 25 µg/kg at 8-h intervals; day 2, 50 µg/kg at 8-h 
intervals; day 3, 75 µg/kg at 8-h intervals; day 4, 100 µg/kg at 8-h intervals; day 5, 
 
150 µg/kg at 8-h intervals; day 6 150 µg/kg at 4-h intervals). On day 7, mice 
received two injections of fentanyl 4 h apart (150 µg/kg) and 30 min after the 
second dose naloxone (10 mg/kg, Sigma) to rapidly induce opiate withdrawal. 
Control mice received an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline and were challenged 
with naloxone on day 7. Signs of withdrawal were recorded after naloxone 
injection for a 20-min test period as described above for morphine withdrawal. 
The experimenter was blind to the drug treatment groups of the mice.
Western blotting. Cultured microglia were harvested in 150 µL lysis buffer 
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X, 
and 5% glycerol. Lysis buffer contained protease inhibitors (Sigma) and phos-
phatase inhibitors (GBiosciences). Total protein was measured using a Pierce 
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Samples were heated at 95 °C 
 
for 5 min in loading buffer (350 mM Tris, 30% glycerol, 1.6% SDS, 1.2% 
bromophenol blue, 6% β-mercaptoethanol) then electrophoresed on a pre-
cast SDS gel (4–12% Tris-HCl, Bio-Rad) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose 
membrane. After blocking, membranes were incubated with rabbit antibody 
to Panx1 (1:250, Life Technologies, 488100) and mouse antibody to β-actin 
(1:2,000, Sigma-Aldrich, A5316). Membranes were washed and incubated 
for 2 h at room temperature in fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies 
(anti-rabbit- and anti-mouse-conjugated immunoreactivity (IR) dyes 1:5,000, 
Mandel Scientific) and quantified by direct detection of secondary antibody 
fluorescence at 680 and 800 nm (LICOR Odyssey CLx). Band intensity was 
quantified using ImageJ, normalized to β-actin and expressed relatively to 
control samples.
Isolation of adult mixed neuron–glia culture. Rats and mice were anaesthe-
tized and perfused transcardially with PBS. Spinal cord and (for mice only) 
brain tissues were isolated and placed in HBSS. After blunt dissociation, spinal 
cord contents were filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer into DMEM con-
taining 10 mM HEPES and 5% FBS. Isotonic Percoll (density 1.23 g/mL) was 
added to the cell suspension, followed by a 1.08 g per mL Percoll underlay31. 
Samples were spun at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 min at 20 °C. Following centrifuga-
tion, myelin debris was removed, and the interface between Percoll gradients 
was collected and transferred into fresh medium. Samples were centrifuged 
again at 1,350 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was reconstituted in PBS 
containing 10% FBS (for flow cytometry) or DMEM containing 10% FBS and 
1% penicillin–streptomycin (for live-cell imaging).
Flow cytometry. Mixed neuron–glia culture was isolated from adult rat spinal 
 
cord as described above. Cells were stained with fluorophore-conjugated 
CD11b/c–PE (1:500 eBioscience, 12-0110-82) and either rabbit antibody to 
Panx1 (1:400 Pierce, PA5-34475, and 1:400 Life Technologies) preincubated

Cell fluorescence was measured by an Attune Acoustic Focusing Cytometer 
(Applied Biosystems). Live single-cell population was gated using forward and 
side scatter plots. CD11b- and Panx1-positive staining were gated using BL2 and 
RL1 intensities, respectively, in single stained cells compared to unstained cells.
BV-2 microglia culture. BV-2 microglial-like cells were provided by M. Tsuda 
and K. Biber12. Cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) containing 5% FBS 
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Pen-Strep) at 37°C with 5% CO2 and treated 
with morphine (10 µM), morphine and CTAP (1 µM), DAMGO (1 µM), saline 
and CTAP, or saline once a day for 5 d. BV-2 microglial-like cells were found to 
be free of mycoplasma contamination using MycoFluor Mycoplasma Detection 
Kit (Molecular Probes).
Calcium imaging. Cells were incubated for 30 min with the fluorescent 
Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2 a.m. (2.5 µM, Molecular Probes) in extracellu-
lar solution (ECS) containing 140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 
10 mM HEPES and 33 mM glucose (pH 7.35, 315 mOsm)32. In a subset of 
experiments, mefloquine (40 µM, Sigma or 100 nM, Bioblocks) or probenecid 
 
(1 mM, Life Technologies) were bath applied in ECS after loading of Fura-2 
a.m. and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before BzATP (100 µM) 
stimulation. All experiments were conducted at room temperature using 
an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti C1SI Spectral Confocal), and the 
fluorescence of individual microglia was recorded using EasyRatioPro soft-
ware (PTI). Excitation light was generated from a xenon arc lamp and passed 
alternatingly through 340- or 380-nm band-pass filters (Omega Optical). The 
340/380 fluorescence ratio was calculated after baseline subtraction.
Generation of Cx3cr1-CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx mice. Mice with microglial-spe-
cific deletion of Panx1 were generated using a Cre-loxP system. Panx1flx/flx 
homozygote mice33 containing loxP sequences flanking exon 2 of the Panx1 
gene were crossed with C57BL6/J mice expressing Cre-ERT2 fusion protein 
and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) under the Cx3cr1 promoter 
(Jax mice: B6.129P2(Cg)-Cx3cr1tm2.1(cre/ERT)Litt/WganJ, stock number 021160). 
Progeny genotype was screened by PCR, and homozygous Panx1flx/flx and 
Cx3cr1-CreERT2 mice were bred and backcrossed for 8 generations to yield the 
conditional knockout Cx3cr1-CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx mice. To induce Cre recom-
bination, mice were injected i.p. with 1 mg per day tamoxifen (Sigma) for 5 d. 
 
Control mice were littermates that received vehicle injections (sunflower oil 
with 10% ethanol) for 5 d, while tamoxifen-related effects were controlled for 
using Panx1flx/flx littermate mice that received 5 d of tamoxifen injections. 
 
In the majority of experiments, testing occurred 7 d after final tamoxifen 
injection. In a subset of experiments, behavioral assessment of morphine with-
drawal was conducted 28 d after final tamoxifen injection to control for effects 
of peripheral Cx3cr1-expressing cells.
YO-PRO dye uptake. After 5 d of morphine or saline treatment, cell culture 
medium was removed, and the BV-2 cells were incubated in ECS contain-
ing either YO-PRO-1 or YO-PRO-3 dye (2.5 µM, Invitrogen). After a 5-min 
baseline recording, cells were stimulated with BzATP (150 µM, Sigma), and 
dye uptake was recorded for 30 min. Cell viability was assessed immediately 
after 30 min recording by application of ionomycin (1 µM, Sigma). Cells that 
did not respond to ionomycin were excluded from the analysis. YO-PRO-1 
dye fluorescence emission (491/509 nm) or YO-PRO-3 dye fluorescent emis-
sion (612/631 nm) was detected at 37 °C using a FilterMax F5 plate reader 
(Molecular Devices). Drugs used included 10panx (10 µM, New England 
Peptide), scrpanx (10 µM, New England Peptide), naloxone (10 µM, Sigma), 
probenecid (1 mM, Life Technologies), and mefloquine (40 µM, Sigma or 
 
100 nM, Bioblocks). Drugs were bath applied in ECS containing YO-PRO-1 
dye (in the absence of morphine) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before 
BzATP stimulation. For the BV-2 cell experiments, fluorescence emission at 
30 min after BzATP application was calculated as an average of the entire 
imaging field as percentage change from baseline, and responses at 30 min 
were averaged over multiple independent experiments. Representative images 
of BV-2 YO-PRO-1 dye uptake were taken using EasyRatioPro software (PTI) 
at room temperature using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti C1S1 
Spectral Confocal). Individual traces of BV-2 YO-PRO-1 dye uptake were 
taken at 10-min intervals and represent the average response of all BV-2 cells 
in the recorded view from a subset of experiments. To assess Panx1 func-
tion in adult microglia, neuron–glia mixture culture was isolated from adult 
Sprague-Dawley rats treated with saline or morphine for 5 d, or from Cx3cr1-
CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx mice treated with tamoxifen or vehicle for 5 d as described 
above. Once isolated, cells were plated in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% 
Pen-Strep and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were washed 
and incubated with DAPI (1:10,000) for 10 min, and then incubated in YO-
PRO-1 dye (rats) or YO-PRO-3 dye (mice). In rats, microglia were identified 
from mixed adult neuronal–glial culture using a fluorophore-conjugated anti-
body CD11b/c-PE (1:500, eBioscience), and in mice microglia were identi-
fied by endogenous expression of eYFP. Fluorescence of individual microglia 
were recorded for a 5-min baseline period and then for 30 min after BzATP 
stimulation (300 µM). Individual traces were taken at 10-min intervals and 
represent responses from a subset of individual microglia. Fluorescence emis-
sion at 30 min was expressed as percentage change from the baseline recorded 
from the same cell.
Naloxone-induced ATP release. ATP levels were detected using biolumi-
nescence by combining samples with recombinant firefly luciferase and its 
substrate d-luciferin (ATP Determination Kit, Life Technologies). The ATPase 
inhibitor (ARL67156, 1 µM, Sigma) was added to the ECS or aCSF (in mM: 126 
NaCl, 1.6 KCl, 1.1 NaH2PO4, 1.4 MgCl2, 2.4 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 11 glucose) 
to minimize breakdown of ATP, and samples were incubated in medium for 
 
30 min before naloxone challenge to reduce mechanically induced ATP release. 
Samples were exposed to naloxone (10 µM) for 30 min, then the supernatant 
was collected and samples read immediately using a FilterMax F5 plate reader 
at 28 °C. For experiments with BV-2 microglial-like cultures, cells were incu-
bated in 10panx (10 µM, New England Peptide), scrpanx (10 µM, New England 
Peptide), probenecid (1 mM, Life Technologies), mefloquine (40 µM, Sigma or 
100 nM, Bioblocks) or ECS for 10 min before naloxone exposure. Final ATP 
measurement was expressed relatively to control samples (saline-treated BV-
2 cells exposed to ECS) from the same plate. For ATP release in spinal cord 
slices, tamoxifen- or vehicle-treated Cx3cr1-CreERT2::Panx1flx/flx mice were 
perfused with ice-cold oxygenated sucrose-substituted aCSF (s-aCSF in mM: 
 
252 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 6 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose), and the spinal cord 
rapidly dissected. The lumbar segment of the spinal cord was sliced into 300 µm 
sections, and incubated in oxygenated 32 °C aCSF for 1 h. Spinal cord slices 
were then transferred to room temperature oxygenated aCSF and exposed to 
naloxone (10 µM). For quantification, ATP release was normalized to total 
protein of each sample.
Histological procedures. Rats and mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital 
(Bimeda-MTC Animal Health Inc.) and perfused transcardially with 4% para-
formaldehyde (PFA) (wt/vol). Following dissection, the spinal lumbar segment 
was post-fixed in 4% PFA, then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Spinal cords 
were sliced at 30 µm into free-floating sections, then incubated overnight at 
4 °C in mouse antibody to CD11b (1:50, CBL1512 EMD Milipore), rat anti-
body to CD11b (1:250, Abcam, ab8878), or rabbit antibody to GFP (1:400, 
Life Technologies, A-6465). Sections were then washed and incubated at 4 °C 
with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000, Cy3-conjugated 
donkey anti-mouse IgG, Jackson Immuno Research; 1:1,000, Cy5-conjugated 
donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Jackson Immuno Research; or 1:2,000 donkey anti-rat 
IgG Alexa Fluor 555, Abcam, ab150154). Images were taken using a Nikon 
Eclipse Ti C1SI Spectral Confocal microscope and a Nikon A1R Multiphoton 
microscope. Quantification was performed using ImageJ (NIH) by an experi-
menter blind to genotype and/or drug treatment.
cFos immunolabeling. Mouse spinal cord tissue was isolated and sectioned as 
described above. Free-floating spinal cord sections were blocked for 10 min with 
0.3% H2O2 and then for 5 min with 1% NaBH4. Sections were incubated over-
night at 4 °C with rabbit antibody to cFos (1:5,000, Abcam, ab7963). Sections 
were washed and incubated for 2 h in biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary anti-
body (1:1,000; Vector Laboratories) then processed with Vectastain ABC kit 
(Vector Laboratories) and developed for 1 min using 3,3-diaminobenzedine 
 
with nickel. Images were taken using an Olympus Virtual Slide System Macro

Slide Scanner and number of Fos-immunoreactive cells within the superficial 
spinal dorsal horn were counted. Imaging and quantification were performed 
by an experimenter blind to genotype and drug treatment.
Ex vivo spinal cord recordings. Electrically evoked field potentials in the 
superficial dorsal horn were recorded as previously described15. Briefly, ani-
mals were anesthetized with urethane (2 g/kg) and perfused transcardially with 
an ice-cold oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) sucrose-based artificial cerebros-
pinal fluid (S-aCSF) solution containing the following (in mM): 252 sucrose, 
 
2.5 KCl, 6 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 4 kynurenic acid and 
10 d-glucose. The lumbar spinal column was rapidly removed and immersed 
in ice-cold S-aCSF, and the spinal cord was obtained by laminectomy. Spinal 
cord explants were allowed to recover for 60 min in an immersion chamber 
containing oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) aCSF (in nM: 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 
2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3 and 10 d-glucose) at room 
temperature. Post-synaptic field potentials (fPSPs) were recorded via a boro-
silicate glass electrode inserted into the dorsal side of the spinal cord explant 
in the dorsal root entry zone. Electrodes were inserted superficially to a depth 
of no more than 125 µm from the dorsal surface of the spinal cord measured 
with an MPC-285 manipulator with MPC-200 controller (Sutter Instrument 
Company). Electrodes had a tip resistance of 3–4 MΩ when filled with aCSF. 
fPSPs were evoked by electrical stimulation of the dorsal root using an aCSF-
filled borosilicate suction electrode placed near the cut end of the dorsal root. 
Field potentials were amplified with a multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular 
Devices), digitized with a Digidata 1322A (Molecular Devices) and recorded 
using pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). Data were filtered during 
acquisition with a low-pass filter set at 1.6 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Test 
stimuli were presented every 60 s to evoke fPSPs, and baseline was determined 
as a 30-min period of stable responses (less than 15% variability). After a 
stable baseline was observed, naloxone (10 µM) was applied via bath or LTP 
was evoked by stimulation at 2 Hz for 2 min with a 25% higher intensity than 
baseline stimulation, after which stimulation intensity was returned to baseline 
levels and test pulses were again delivered once per minute. Data were analyzed 
using ClampFit 10 software (Molecular Devices). The area of fPSPs relative to 
baseline was measured from 0 to 800 ms after the onset of the fPSP.
Statistics. All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m., and each data point repre-
sents an individual animal or experiment. Tests of statistical difference were 
performed with GraphPad Prism 6 software using unpaired t-test (two-sided), 
or ordinary one-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni or Sidak’s test. Time 
course and daily anti-nociception experiments were analyzed using a two-way 
repeated measure ANOVA with post hoc Sidak test. Sample sizes are consistent 
with those reported in similar studies and provide sufficient power to detect 
changes with the appropriate statistical analysis. Data used for statistical com-
parison fit a Gaussian distribution, and variances were equivalent between 
groups. For all experiments, a criterion α level was set at 0.05.

rent study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
