Abstract
To elucidate the roles of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 primary unexplained infertile women,
a prospective randomized study was conducted on a cohort of primary unexplained infertile
women and a cohort of control women, with at least one successful pregnancy. HHV-6 DNA
was analyzed and the percentage and immune-phenotype of resident endometrial Natural
Killer (NK) cells, as the first line of defense towards viral infections, was evaluated in endo-
metrial biopsies. Cytokine levels in uterine flushing samples were analyzed. HHV-6A DNA
was found in 43% of endometrial biopsies from primary unexplained infertile women, but not
in control women. On the contrary, HHV-6B DNA was absent in endometrial biopsies, but
present in PBMCs of both cohorts. Endometrial NK cells presented a different distribution in
infertile women with HHV6-A infection compared with infertile women without HHV6-A infec-
tion. Notably, we observed a lower percentage of endometrial specific CD56brightCD16-
NK cells. We observed an enhanced HHV-6A-specific endometrial NK cell response in
HHV-6A positive infertile women, with a marked increase in the number of endometrial NK
cells activating towards HHV-6A infected cells. The analysis of uterine flushing samples
showed an increase in IL-10 levels and a decrease of IFN-gamma concentrations in infertile
women with HHV6-A infection. Our study indicates, for the first time, that HHV-6A infection
might be an important factor in female unexplained infertility development, with a possible
role in modifying endometrial NK cells immune profile and ability to sustain a successful
pregnancy.
Introduction
HHV-6 is an ubiquitous virus that was first discovered in 1986 [1]. It has been identified as the
etiological agent of roseola infantum, and has been implicated (with various degrees) in a num-
ber of conditions such as liver disease [2], pneumonitis [3], myocarditis [4], multiple sclerosis
[5], drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome [6, 7], the nodular sclerosis subset of Hodgkin’s

 lymphoma [8], and autoimmune diseases [9]. Since early times after HHV-6 discovery, the
existence of the viral variants (HHV-6A and HHV-6B) was recognized [10]. Recently, HHV-6
variants have been recognized as different viral species, on the basis of specific biological,
immunological, pathological and molecular characteristics [11].
Although both HHV-6 variants infect mainly T-cells it has wide tropism are important dif-
ferences in cell tropism between HHV-6A and HHV-6B, HHV-6A but not HHV-6B repro-
duces in human neural stem cells [12], oligodendrocyte progenitor cells [13] and hepatocytes
[14] while HHV-6B infection in astrocytes and hepatocytes result in abortive infection. HHV-
6A but not HHV-6B can productively infect CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells and gamma/delta
T cells. Some evidence suggests that HHV-6 can also infect and replicate in the human genital
tract [15, 16]. In fact: HHV-6 DNA has been detected in genital tract secretions from pregnant
and non-pregnant women [17–19]; several studies have reported low-level HHV-6 shedding
from the genital tract in up to 25% of women [18–21], with pregnant women characterized by
the highest prevalence of shedding [19]; HHV-6 DNA sequences and antigens have been
detected in biopsies in archived cervical samples [22–26]. More specifically, the in-vitro HHV-
6A infection of cervical carcinoma cell lines [27, 28] raises the possibility that the detection
HHV-6 footprints reflect the ability of the virus to infect cervical cells, instead of being simply
attributed to infected lymphocytes present in the tissue.
These data suggest that the female genital tract may be a secondary site for HHV-6 infection
or persistence, although this needs to be confirmed. The possible pathogenic relevance for the
genital presence of HHV-6 deserves careful evaluation.
In an attempt to elucidate this understudied aspect of HHV-6 biology, we analyzed the pres-
ence of HHV-6 infection in two cohorts of women with differing levels of fertility. Specifically,
we studied the prevalence of HHV-6A and HHV-6B infection in the uterine flushing and endo-
metrium biopsies of a randomized group of women with primary infertility group attending an
infertility clinic in Italy and a cohort of fertile women. In addition, we assessed the possibility
that HHV-6 infection might affect NK cells and cytokine secretion in the uterine environment.
Materials and Methods
Clinical Samples
Endometrial tissues were collected from patients that were recruited at admission for tubal
patency assessment by Hystero-sono contrast sonography. Inclusion criteria for the study
group were: 21–38 years old, regular menstrual cycle (24–35 days), body mass index (BMI)
ranging between 18 and 26 Kg/m2, FSH (day 2–3 of the menstrual cycle) <10 mUI/mL, 17-β-
Estradiol < 50 pg/ml (day 2–3 of the menstrual cycle), normal karyotype. Women with endo-
metritis, endometriosis, tubal factor, ovulatory dysfunction, anatomical uterine pathologies
and recurrent miscarriage were excluded. The stage of the menstrual cycle was categorized into
secretory (days 14–28). Five women were enrolled for the collection of endometrial samples in
three time points of the mestrual cycle: proliferative (days 5–14), ovulatory (days 11–21) and
secretory (days 14–28) phases. Tissue samples collected in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco modified
Eagle medium/ Hams F-12 (DMEM/F-12; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 1% antibiotic- anti-
mycotic solution (final concentrations: 100 μg/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin
sulfate, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B; Invitrogen), and 5% newborn calf serum (NCS; CSL Ltd.,
Parkville, VIC, Australia), stored at 4°C, and processed within 2 hrs.

 Preparation of Endometrial Epithelial and Stromal Cells
The endometrium was dissociated in Ca2+ and Mg2+ free phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH
7.4) containing 300 μg/ml collagenase type III (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Free-
hold, NJ) and 40 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease type I (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in
a shaking incubator (Bioline 4700; Edwards Instrument Company, Narellan, NSW, Australia)
rotating at 150 rpm at 37°C [29]. At 15-min intervals, the digests were pipetted vigorously and
dissociation was monitored microscopically. After 45 min, the cell suspensions were filtered
using a 40-μm sieve (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) to separate single cells
from debris. Further dissociation of the filtrate was prevented by the addition of HEPES-buff-
ered DMEM/F-12/5%FCS. To isolate mononuclear, stromal and epithelial cells we used Ficoll-
Paque (Pharmacia Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden) and centrifuged for 8–10 min at 390 × g.
Endometrial epithelial cells were removed from the Ficoll-Paque-medium interface by positive
selection using BerEP4-coated magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway).The
beaded epithelial cells were recovered, washed several times in HEPES-buffered DMEM/F-12/
1%FCS using a magnetic particle collector (Dynal Biotech) and seeded on basement membrane
extract (BME) (Matrigel1, Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA, USA) culture
plates. The supernatant containing mononuclear and stromal cells were collected and seeded
on 100 mm plastic tissue culture dishes. After 12hrs culture the supernatant cells were depleted
from the culture, to eliminate mononuclear non adherent cells. Purity of epithelial and stromal
components was assessed by morphological determination by light microscopy and reassessed
by cytokeratin-18 (CK18) and vimentin staining for epithelial and stromal cells respectively.
Each cell population was routinely over 98% purity.
DNA Analysis
DNA samples were extracted as described [30]. HHV-6 DNA presence and load were analyzed
by PCR and real time quantitative (qPCR) specific for the U94 and U42 genes [30], and sam-
ples were considered positive when 1 μg of cell DNA harbored more than 100 copies of viral
DNA. Amplification of the house-keeping human RNase P or beta-actin genes was used as a
control. All clinical samples were analyzed in a randomized and blinded fashion. In addition,
when there was enough material to repeat the analysis, the samples were tested again in a ran-
domized and blinded fashion at a distant time from the first analyses. HHV-6 variant A or B
identification was obtained by restriction enzyme digestion with HindIII enzyme of the U31
nested PCR amplification product, as reported previously [30]. Digestion products were then
visualized on ethidium bromide stained agarose gel after electrophoresis migration.
Immunofluorescence Assay
Immunofluorescence for HHV-6 antigen expression was performed with a mouse monoclonal
antibodies (mAb) directed against p41 and IE2 (early antigen) and glycoprotein gp116 (late anti-
gen) of HHV-6 A and B (ABI, Columbia, MD, USA), as previously described [30]. Epithelial and
stromal cells were respectively stained with mouse anti-Cytokeratin- 18, a heterotetramer cyto-
skeleton protein (CK18) and rabbit anti-vimentin, an intermediate filament of the cytoskeleton
proteins moAbs (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), respectively. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI
(4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-dihydrochroride) (Sigma-Aldrich, S.Louis, MO, USA).
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Purification
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll gradient
(Cederlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada) and resuspended in RPMI medium (EuroClone,

 Milano, Italy) with 10% FCS, 100U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich,
S.Louis, MO, USA).
NK Cell Purification
Peripheral and endometrial NK cells were purified from PBMC and endometrial samples,
respectively, through negative magnetic cell separation (MACS) system (Miltenyi Biotech,
Gladbach, Germany) [31]. As determined by flow cytometry with CD3-PerCp-Cy5.5,
CD56-FITC moAbs (e-Bioscience, Frankfurt, DE), the procedure resulted in >90% pure NK
cells (data non shown). Freshly isolated NK cells were cultured for 24 h in medium supple-
mented with suboptimal doses of IL-12 (1 ng/ml) [31].
HHV Cell Infection
HeLa cell line (ATCC CCL-2) was grown in DMEM F12 medium (Euroclone) supplemented
with L-glutamine in presence of 1% penicillin-streptamycine and 10% of FCS at 37°C with the
5% of CO2. HeLa cell lines were infected with HHV-6A and HSV-1 to evaluate NK cell activa-
tion. We used HeLa cells as a good in vitro model of epithelial cells to perform and obtain
HSV-1 and HHV-6A in vitro infection.
We used HHV-6A (strain U1102) cell free virus inocula [30] and infected with 10 genome
equivalents per 1 cell. We used HSV-1 strain F at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 PFU (plaque
forming unit)/cell for 48 hrs [31]. We used HSV-1 and HHV-6A UV-inactivated viral prepara-
tions as controls.
Infected cells were then collected to perform co-culture experiment with NK cells.
Flow Cytometry
NK cells were defined as CD3-/CD56+ cells. CD158b levels were measured in the CD3-/CD56
+ gated cells. Cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide staining. Anti-isotype controls
(Exbio, Praha, CZ) were performed. For the CD107a degranulation assay, the cells were incu-
bated 1 h at 37°C with anti-CD107a moAb and treated with Golgi Stop solution (Becton Dick-
inson, San Jose, CA, USA) for 3 hrs [31]. The CD107a mobilization assay was performed using
HHV-6A infected or non-infected HeLa cells as target cells and NK cells from controls or
patients as effector cells, with an effector:target ratio of 2:1. 10 ng/ml LPS (Calbiochem, La
Jolla, Calif., USA), 25 μg/ml CpG-ODN (ODN-C, TIB MOLBIOL, Genova, Italy) and HSV-1
infected HeLa cells were used as positive control of NK activation. Degranulation was assessed
in triplicate after 4 hours of co-culture by staining with PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD107a mAb
(e-Bioscience, Frankfurt, DE) [31]. Ten thousand events were acquired.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Stat View (SAS Institute Inc). Biological data were ana-
lysed by Student T test because they presented a normal distribution (Kruskal Wallis test). Sta-
tistical significance was assumed for p<0.05 (two tailed).
Results
HHV-6 in Clinical Specimens
We enrolled 30 women with unexplained primary infertility characterized by the absence of
previous pregnancies or pathological determinant, and 36 fertile women with at least one previ-
ous successful pregnancy. As reported in Table 1, no significant differences were present
between the two cohorts, except a slight increase in estradiol levels in infertile patients

 (p = 0.05; Student T test). High estradiol levels could indicate that this hormone is artificially
suppressing FSH levels and there could be fertility problems. No differences in progesterone
levels were found.
All clinical samples were analyzed for the presence of HHV-6 infection and the results are
reported in Table 2. We observed the presence of HHV-6B DNA in the 25% and 28% of the
PBMC of women with primary infertility and control women, respectively (p = 0.75; Fisher
exact test). These results are in agreement with literature data [32], that reported the presence
of the HHV-6B variant in a 25–30% of peripheral blood samples. HHV-6A DNA was not
detected in PBMC of all the subjects. Surprisingly, the 43% (13/30) of the endometrial epithelial
cells from women with primary infertility were positive for HHV-6A DNA, while the cohort of
control women did not present HHV-6A viral DNA in their endometrial epithelial cells
(p = 5.8x10-6; Fisher exact test). HHV-6B DNA was not present in endometrial epithelial cells
from either group.
Endometrial epithelial cells from HHV6-A positive primary infertile women showed an
average viral load of 450.000 copies/ug of cellular DNA (range 670.000–250.000 copies/ug
DNA), corresponding to about 4 copies of viral DNA per diploid cell (Fig 1A). Also stromal
cells obtained from the purification of epithelial cells were analyzed for HHV-6 presence and,

 interestingly, no HHV-6 DNA was detected (Table 2; Fig 1B), supporting a localized site of
infection for HHV-6A into endometrial epithelium of primary unexplained infertile women.
To be sure of the specific HHV-6A infection in endometrial epithelial cells, we cultured
both epithelial and stromal cells and evaluated the presence of HHV-6A proteins. The use of
CK18 and vimentin staining in immune-fluorescence confirmed the purification of epithelial
cells from stromal cells respectively. We observed the expression of HHV-6A p41 (early) and
gp116 (late) proteins after 14 days of culture in approximately 15% of the explanted epithelial
cells (Fig 1C).
Since we performed all the experiments on endometrial cells derived from the secretory
phase of the menstrual cycle, we analyzed HHV-6A protein expression by endometrial cells

 also from proliferative and ovulatory phases. As reported in Fig 2A, we observed HHV-6A
DNA in all three menstrual cycle phases while the expression of HHV-6A IE2 early protein is
evident only in the secretory phase (Fig 2B), suggesting a sub-clinical reactivation of HHV-6A
latent infection during this specific menstrual cycle phase.
HHV-6A Modifies Endometrial eNK Cell Immune-Phenotype and Uterine
Cytokine Environment
Due to the high prevalence of HHV-6A active infection in a percentage of infertile women, we
searched for the presence of differences in clinical and immunological parameters, subdividing
infertile women on the basis of the presence/absence of HHV-6A infection (Tables 3 and 4).
Estradiol levels are higher in infertile women with HHV-6A infection in comparison with
those HHV-6A negative (p = 0.045) (Table 3). The previous identification of a correlation
between estrogen and herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation from latency [33] suggests a
possible implication of estradiol high levels in HHV-6A infection. In fact, we observed a corre-
lation between the levels of estradiol and the presence of HHV-6A infection (p = 0.02; r2: 0.84;
Spearman correlation). The other clinical parameters did not present differences in the two
cohorts (Table 3). When we considered the immunological characteristics, we observed a dif-
ference in endometrial (e)NK cell immune-phenotype and cytokine levels in the uterine envi-
ronment. We found a lower CD56posCD16neg eNK cell number in HHV-6A positive infertile
women (65.1 ± 12.1) in comparison with HHV-6A negative infertile women (192.1 ± 28.4)
(p = 0.001) (Table 4). The distribution of CD56bright and CD56dim eNK cells was different
between HHV-6A positive and negative infertile women, with lower CD56bright and CD56dim
eNK cells number in HHV-6A positive infertile women (30.0± 15.1; 35.8 ± 10.2) in comparison
with HHV-6A negative infertile women (110.3 ± 2.1; 82.1 ± 6.4) (p = 0.001) (Table 4). CD3+
lymphocytes were not detected in both cohorts, while CD14+ monocytes presented no differ-
ences in cell number (p = 0.51). The uterine flushing levels of cytokines showed a different

 pattern in HHV-6A positive and negative infertile women. We observed a significant increase
in IL-10 and a decrease in IFN-gamma levels in HHV-6A positive in comparison with HHV-
6A negative infertile women (p = 0.014, p = 0.012, respectively) (Table 4). The other cytokines,
TNF-alpha, IL-12 and IL-22, were similarly expressed in the uterine flushing samples of the
two cohorts (Table 4). When we compared infertile and control women, we observed no differ-
ences in clinical parameters except for estradiol levels, that are higher in both HHV-6A nega-
tive and positive infertile women in comparison with controls (p = 0.042; 0.046, respectively)
(Table 3). We found a similar frequency of eNK cell subtypes and cytokine levels with HHV-
6A negative infertile women and controls (Table 4), while HHV-6A positive infertile women
presented lower CD56bright and CD56dim eNK cell number, higher IL-10 and lower IFN-
gamma levels in uterine flushing samples (Table 4). Peripheral blood NK cell subtypes and
cytokine levels did not differ between the three cohorts (S1 Table).

 HHV-6A Modifies Endometrial NK Cell Functions
Immunological memory is classically regarded as an attribute of antigen-specific T and B lym-
phocytes of the adaptive immune system. Cells of the innate immune system, including NK
cells, are assumed to be short-lived cytolytic cells that can rapidly respond against pathogens in
an antigen-independent manner and then die off. However, NK cells have recently been
described to possess traits of adaptive immunity, such as clonal expansion after viral antigen
exposure to generate long-lived memory cells [34]. We evaluated the possible differences
between eNK cells response to HHV-6A infection in HHV-6A positive and negative infertile
women. As a challenge, we used HeLa, human epithelioid cervix carcinoma, infected with
HHV-6A laboratory strain. We observed the expression of HHV-6 proteins on the surface of
HeLa cells 3 days post infection (Fig 3A). eNK cells purified from endometrial biopsies were
challenged with HHV-6A HeLa infected cells and the activation status was evaluated. We
observed the highest activation in eNK cells from HHV-6A positive infertile women toward
HHV-6A HeLa infected cells (Fig 3B). On the contrary, eNK cells from HHV-6A negative
infertile women presented a lower activation towards HHV-6A HeLa infected cells (Fig 3B),
similar to eNK cells from women with a previous successful pregnancy (Fig 3B). The same
eNK cells were challenged with other stimuli: LPS, CpG-ODN and HSV-1 HeLa infected cells.
LPS and CpG-ODN stimulation induced a similar activation in eNK cells from the three
cohorts (Fig 3C). HSV-1 HeLa infected cells induced a slight increase in CD107a expression in
all the three cohorts (Fig 3C).
Similarly, peripheral blood pNK cells from the three cohorts were challenged with HHV-6A
HeLa infected cells, LPS, CpG-ODN and HSV-1 HeLa infected cells. We observed no activation
towards HHV-6A HeLa infected cells (Fig 3D) and a slight and comparable increase in the
activation of pNK cells from the three cohorts (Fig 3E). UV-inactivated viral preparations
induced no eNK and pNK cell activation in all the three cohorts (S1A and S1B Fig).
Discussion
Viral infections have been considered as possible environmental factors in human infertility
[35]. In particular, herpesviruses have been implicated in male infertility [36], but no specific
virus has yet been conclusively identified as associated with female infertility.
In our report, 43% of endometrial epithelial cells from women with unexplained infertility
were found positive for HHV-6A DNA, whereas no control women (with at least one previous
successful pregnancy) harbored the virus. Furthermore, endometrial epithelial cells from
women with unexplained infertility harbored significant viral loads (approximately 4 copies of
viral DNA per cell), but no HHV-6A infection was detected in stromal cells and PBMC,
excluding the presence of chromosomally integrated HHV-6 DNA [37]. Interestingly, the per-
centage of HHV-6B positive PBMC in both cohorts was similar to the common population
[32]. These observation strengthen the notion that HHV-6A and B have different biological
behavior and pathological associations [11]. This different behavior could reflect the fact that
HHV-6 variants use different cell receptors. In fact, HHV-6A uses CD46, an ubiquitous mole-
cule present on all cell types [38], while HHV-6B uses CD134, that is expressed mainly on acti-
vated Treg T lymphocytes [39]. Furthermore, our results indicate that the uterus of infertile
women may constitute a site of active HHV-6A infection/replication. Considering that these
women have no HHV-6A in their PBMC, unidentified micro-environmental factors are proba-
bly required to allow HHV-6A infection of the uterine epithelial cells. Possibly, the estradiol
high levels found in infertile women could act as a co-factor allowing HHV-6 infection of
endometrium [33]. Permissiveness to HHV-6A infection of uterine epithelial cells was con-
firmed by our ex vivo experiments showing HHV-6A protein expression during the secretory

 menstrual cycle phase, suggesting a hormonal implication in HHV-6A sub-clinical reactiva-
tion. It is known that steroids cause HHV-6 to replicate disproportionately [40] and reactivate
HHV-6 in transplant patients [41]. Here we provide evidence indicating that HHV-6A may
induce a modification in eNK cell immune-phenotype and cytokine levels. We observed a
decrease in CD56brightCD16neg eNK cells in HHV-6A positive infertile women, an increase of

against HHV-6 IE2 early and gp116 late antigens. HeLa HHV-6A infected cells were co-cultured for 4 hours with NK cells, purified from endometrial biopsies
and peripheral blood. NK cell activation status was evaluated after CD107a staining by flow cytometry. Percentage of CD107a NK cells are reported after co-

 Th2 IL-10 cytokine and a decrease of Th1 IFN-gamma cytokine, with an increase of the Th1/
Th2 ratio. These results are in agreement with the correlation of Th1/Th2 ratio increase and
female infertility condition [42]. Moreover, it is known that HHV-6 infection increases IL-10
expression by monocytes [43] and reduces the release of IFN-gamma [44] by T lymphocytes.
Interesting, HHV-6A negative infertile women presented a similar distribution of eNK cell sub-
types and cytokine levels in uterine flushing samples in comparison with control women.
These data suggest the presence of different immunological components implicated in the
infertile condition of the two cohorts of HHV-6A positive and negative women with unex-
plained infertility. Intriguingly, enhanced HHV-6A-specific eNK cell responses were observed
in HHV-6A positive women with unexplained infertility, with a marked increase in the num-
ber of eNK cells activating towards HHV-6A infected cells. On the contrary, eNK cells have a
similar activation pattern to other stimuli (LPS, CpG-ODN, HSV-1 infection) in comparison
with eNK cells from HHV-6A negative women with unexplained infertility and control
women. Peripheral blood NK cells from all the three cohorts present no activation towards
HHV-6A infected cells and a slight but comparable activation towards LPS, CpG-ODN and
HSV-1 infection. These findings are consistent with an abnormal, probably persistent, immune
response towards HHV-6A antigens in a subgroup of women with unexplained infertility, pos-
sibly favored by the local cytokine and eNK cell environment induced by HHV-6A infection.
These HHV-6A-specific responses elicit an over-activation of the eNK cell compartment, as
suggested by the increased responses of eNK cells to HHV-6A infection and a different
immune-phenotype of eNK cells. In fact, we observed a decrease in CD56brightCD16neg eNK
cells in HHV-6A positive infertile women, that modifies the eNK cell subset at the uterine envi-
ronment. These results are in agreement with our previous data on HHV-6 infection in Hashi-
moto thyroiditis patients, where we observed an increased sensitization of NK cells to this virus
[30].
Interestingly, previous observations support our results on the possible adverse effect of
HHV-6A on pregnancy: i) Gervasi and coauthors [45] observed the presence of HHV-6 infec-
tion in amniotic fluid of a patient that developed gestational hypertension at term and of a
patient who delivered at 33 weeks for premature rupture of membranes; ii) Revest and coau-
thors [46] reported a maternal–fetal HHV-6 infection leading to abortion following HHV-6
seroconversion during pregnancy; iii) Ando and coauthors [47] and Drago and coauthors [48]
found a correlation between miscarriages and increased HHV-6 antibody levels and reactiva-
tion; Gibson and coauthors [49] observed the association of HHV-6 (and HHV-7, Varicella
zoster) newborn infection with preterm pregnancies and pregnancy-induced hypertensive
disorders.
However, further studies are required to confirm the association of HHV-6A infection as a
trigger of female primary unexplained infertility. Indeed, there are several potential mecha-
nisms by which HHV-6 might induce female infertility. Viral infections might trigger eNK cell
functional modifications that could also induce aberrant expression of cytokines thereby pro-
moting a dysfunctional uterine environment.
Overall, our study indicates that HHV-6A infection might be an important factor in female
primary unexplained infertility.
