Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Though anecdotally linked, few studies have investigated the impact of facial 
paralysis on depression and quality of life (QOL).
OBJECTIVE—To measure the association between depression, QOL, and facial paralysis in 
patients seeking treatment at a facial plastic surgery clinic.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS—Data were prospectively collected for patients with all-
cause facial paralysis and control patients initially presenting to a facial plastic surgery clinic from 
2013 to 2015. The control group included a heterogeneous patient population presenting to facial 
plastic surgery clinic for evaluation. Patients who had prior facial reanimation surgery or missing 
demographic and psychometric data were excluded from analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Demographics, facial paralysis etiology, facial 
paralysis severity (graded on the House-Brackmann scale), Beck depression inventory, and QOL 
scores in both groups were examined. Potential confounders, including self-reported attractiveness 
and mood, were collected and analyzed. Self-reported scores were measured using a 0 to 100 
visual analog scale.
RESULTS—There was a total of 263 patients (mean age, 48.8 years; 66.9% were female) were 
analyzed. There were 175 control patients and 88 patients with facial paralysis. Sex distributions 
were not significantly different between the facial paralysis and control groups. Patients with facial 
paralysis had significantly higher depression, lower self-reported attractiveness, lower mood, and

 lower QOL scores. Overall, 37 patients with facial paralysis (42.1%) screened positive for 
depression, with the greatest likelihood in patients with House-Brackmann grade 3 or greater 
(odds ratio, 10.8; 95% CI, 5.13–22.75) compared with 13 control patients (8.1%) (P < .001). In 
multivariate regression, facial paralysis and female sex were significantly associated with higher 
depression scores (constant, 2.08 [95% CI, 0.77–3.39]; facial paralysis effect, 5.98 [95% CI, 4.38–
7.58]; female effect, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.65–3.25]). Facial paralysis was associated with lower QOL 
scores (constant, 81.62 [95% CI, 78.98–84.25]; facial paralysis effect, −16.06 [95% CI, −20.50 to 
−11.62]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—For treatment-seeking patients, facial paralysis was 
significantly associated with increased depression and worse QOL scores. In addition, female sex 
was significantly associated with increased depression scores. Moreover, patients with a greater 
severity of facial paralysis were more likely to screen positive for depression. Clinicians initially 
evaluating patients should consider the psychological impact of facial paralysis to optimize care.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE—2.
Facial expression serves as a sophisticated, conserved mechanism to convey emotional 
information during social interactions.1 A breakdown of this important social 
communication tool affects both a person’s self-concept and observers’ inferences.2 One 
potential breakdown experienced by patients is the loss of facial nerve function. Patients 
with facial paralysis can have impaired facial movement and resting facial asymmetry, 
resulting in facial deformity.
Across cultures and generations, facial deformity has been associated with significant 
psychosocial repercussions, including social stigma and psychological distress.2 
Consequently, patients with facial deformity often experience negative self-image, low self-
esteem, and social isolation.3 For patients without support and unable to cope, the social and 
psychological distress may lead to the development of maladaptive behaviors and 
depression.4 Along with understanding the universal impact of facial deformity, there has 
been further interest in understanding the associated penalties specific to the population of 
individuals with facial paralysis. Prior studies have found that observers perceive faces with 
facial paralysis as less attractive, more bothersome, and having a negative affect display 
compared with normal faces.5–7 Moreover, observers gazing at a paralyzed face have an 
altered pattern of facial attention.8 Given these findings, we can expect patients with facial 
paralysis to experience difficulties with social interactions and psychological distress. These 
negative consequences can lead patients to seek treatment by a facial plastic surgeon with 
the hopes of restoring facial appearance, self-image, and overall quality of life (QOL). While 
prior studies have underscored the impact for facial deformities in general, few studies have 
specifically investigated the psychological impact of facial paralysis involving depression 
and QOL.3,4,9,10 Furthermore, prior studies have not characterized the impact of facial 
paralysis severity on depression. Identifying patients with significant emotional distress 
resulting in depression supports optimal patient outcomes and experience.
The aim of the present study was to better understand the association between facial 
paralysis, depression, and QOL in patients seeking treatment by a facial plastic 
reconstructive surgeon. We hypothesize that patients with facial paralysis will have worse

 depression scores and consequently lower QOL scores compared with normal individuals. 
Moreover, our secondary hypothesis is that patients with facial paralysis are more likely to 
screen positive for depression compared with normal individuals. We postulate that, similar 
to patients with other facial deformities, patients with facial paralysis will report lower mood 
and self-attractiveness scores compared with normal individuals.
Methods
Patient Population and Study Overview
Johns Hopkins institutional review board approval was received for this prospective 
observational study. Patients initially presenting for unilateral facial paralysis evaluation 
were prospectively enrolled from October 2013 to March 2016 in the facial plastic surgery 
clinic of 3 facial plastic surgeons (P.J.B., K.D.O.B, and L.E.I.). Patients with facial paralysis 
of all levels of severity and etiologies were eligible. A heterogeneous group of control 
patients without facial paralysis was prospectively enrolled at initial presentation to a facial 
plastic surgery clinic. All patients 18 years or older and English speaking were eligible. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Patients were excluded 
(1) if they were younger than 18 years, (2) had prior facial paralysis surgery, (3) had a head 
and neck malignant neoplasm, (4) had prior head and neck surgery, and (5) were unable to 
independently complete questionnaires. Patients who did not have demographic or 
psychometric data were excluded from the model analysis. Patients were not compensated 
for participating.
Data Collection
Demographic information, clinical history, facial paralysis etiology, laterality of facial 
paralysis, and facial paralysis severity were collected by trained study personnel. 
Demographic data included age, sex, race, marital status, highest level of education, and 
socioeconomic status. Facial paralysis etiology was determined by clinical history. The 
House Brackman (HB) grade (1–6) was determined from baseline photographs.11
Patient psychometric data were collected using either paper or web-based validated 
questionnaires: (1) Beck Depression Inventory, (2) QOL, (3) self-reported attractiveness, and 
(4) overall mood. Patients were instructed to complete the questionnaires in an untimed 
manner. As previously described, the Beck Depression Inventory12 includes 21 questions 
with total scores ranging from 0 to 63, with higher scores corresponding to increasing 
depression, and scores of 10 or lower characterized as normal. Patients scoring 10 or higher 
on the Beck Depression Inventory were categorized as screening positive for at least mild 
depression (positive depression screen).12 Patients reported overall QOL on a visual analog 
scale from 0 (death) to 100 (perfect health).13 Patients rated their own attractiveness using a 
visual analog scale of 0 (least attractive) to 100 (most attractive). Patients rated their overall 
mood using a visual analog scale of 0 (very sad) to 100 (very happy).
Study Objectives
The primary objective was to measure the associations between depression, QOL, and facial 
paralysis. The secondary objective was to determine the likelihood of screening positive for

 mild depression in facial paralysis and control groups. Finally, we sought to compare mean 
QOL, depression, attractiveness, and overall mood scores between patients with facial 
paralysis (hereinafter, facial paralysis group) and control groups.
Statistical Analysis
Data were collected using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCAP; https://
www.project-redcap.org) and analyzed using Stata SE software (version 13; StataCorp). 
Multiple analytic techniques were used in this study with the experiment-wide significance 
level set at α = .05.
Demographic and Psychometric Comparisons—Demographic characteristics and 
facial paralysis characteristics were examined. Next, differences in mean Beck Depression 
Inventory scores, QOL scores, self-reported attractiveness, and overall mood scores between 
facial paralysis and control groups were analyzed using the Hotelling T2, assuming a 
multivariate normal distribution, followed by individual planned hypothesis testing using t 
test. The Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple comparisons.
Positive Depression Screen—The association between facial paralysis and screening 
positive for at least mild depression was examined. Subsequently, the effect of facial 
paralysis severity on the likelihood of screening positive for depression controlling for sex 
was examined using multiple logistic regression.
Structural Equation Modeling—Structural equation modeling was used to understand 
the associations between depression, QOL, and facial paralysis accounting for female sex, a 
known confounder for depression.14 As previously described, when relating patient-reported 
instruments to underlying domains and concepts, structural equation modeling is an effective 
approach to create an asymmetric multivariate regression model involving observed 
variables accounting for intrinsic sources of variance and covariance.15–17 A conceptual 
framework was generated to reflect the associa-
tionsinourstructuralequationmodel(Figure).Sensitivityanaly-sis for missing data was 
performed using multiple imputation.18
Results
A total of 263 patients were prospectively enrolled from October 2013 to March 2016. Of 
the 263 eligible patients, 250 patients fully completed the provided questionnaires, with a 
response rate of 95.1%. Thirteen patients were excluded from analysis. Most patients were 
white (79%), female (67%), married or engaged (63%), and educated with a 4-year college 
degree (36%). The mean (SD) age was 49 (16) years. Overall, 88 patients (33.5%) were in 
the facial paralysis group and 175 patients (66.5%) were in the control group (Table 1). 
Comparison of sex distribution between both groups revealed no significant difference 
( 
; P = .81). Within the facial paralysis group (Table 2), the most common facial 
paralysis etiologies included acoustic neuroma resection (31.8% of patients) and Bell palsy 
(29.6%) and the most common facial paralysis severity was HB grade 6 (11.0%).

 Patient psychometric characteristics are presented in Table 3. Multivariate analysis using 
Hotelling T2 test comparing mean Beck Depression Inventory scores, QOL scores, self-
reported attractiveness, and overall mood scores revealed a significant difference between 
the group with facial paralysis and the control group (T2 = 71.24; F4,240 = 17.59; P < .001). 
Further planned hypothesis testing, correcting for multiple comparisons, showed that 
patients with facial paralysis had significantly higher depression scores (t248 = −7.17; P < .
001), lower QOL scores (t261 = 7.07; P < .001), lower self-reported attractiveness (t256 = 
5.93; P < .001), and lower mood scores (t261 = 5.79; P < .001).
Overall, 37 patients with facial paralysis and 13 control patients screened positive for at least 
mild depression. A positive depression screen was significantly more common in the facial 
paralysis group (42.1%) compared with the control group (8.1%; 
; P < .001). The 
prevalence of depression in the control group, which contains more female patients, 
similarly reflects the prevalence of depression in the United States population (7.6%).19 
There was no significant association between facial paralysis etiology and screening positive 
for depression ( 
; P = .93).
Multiple logistic regression (LR) analysis examining the association of facial paralysis 
severity and the likelihood of screening positive for depression (controlled for female sex) 
showed that compared with patients without paralysis, patients with HB grade 3 or greater 
facial paralysis were significantly associated with a positive depression screen ( 
; 
P < .001; constant, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03–0.14). The odds of patients screening positive for 
depression significantly increased in patients with HB grade 3 or greater (OR, 10.80; 95% 
CI, 5.12–22.75) compared with control patients. However, there was no significant increase 
in the odds of screening positive for depression for patients with HB grade 2 (OR, 3.15; 95% 
CI, 0.91–10.96; P = .07) compared with control patients.
It has been previously noted that facial deformities and female sex are associated with 
depression.4,14 Moreover, facial paralysis has been shown to be associated with lower 
QOL.20,21 However, there is no significant difference in quality life between men and 
women.22 With consideration of these findings, a structured equation model is presented in 
Table 4 showing the impact of facial paralysis and female sex on depression scores and the 
impact of facial paralysis on QOL scores. Results from sensitivity analysis for missing data 
using multiple imputation did not show significantly different outcomes; hence, the simpler 
model is presented. On structural equation modeling, facial paralysis and female sex were 
significantly associated with higher depression scores (constant, 2.08 [95% CI, 0.77–3.39]; 
facial paralysis effect, 5.98 [95% CI, 4.38–7.58]; female effect, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.65–3.25]). 
In addition, facial paralysis was associated with lower QOL scores (constant, 81.62 [95% CI, 
78.98–84.25]; facial paralysis effect, −16.06 [95% CI, −20.50 to −11.62]).
Discussion
In this study population, treatment-seeking patients with facial paralysis were associated 
with higher depression scores and lower QOL scores compared with patients without facial 
paralysis. Moreover, female patients were associated with higher depression scores. When 
screening for depression, patients seeking treatment for facial paralysis were significantly

 more likely to screen positive for at least mild depression compared with control patients. 
Furthermore, patients with more severe facial paralysis (HB grade ≥3) were significantly 
more likely to screen positive for depression. In addition to higher depression and lower 
QOL scores, patients with facial paralysis had significantly lower self-reported attractiveness 
and overall mood scores compared with control patients. These findings emphasize the 
importance of considering the psychological impact of facial paralysis, and its bearing on 
QOL, on patients seeking treatment for facial paralysis.
A person’s self-concept is a dynamic construct associated with intrapersonal and 
interpersonal processes.23 This multidimensional framework arises from information a 
person gathers about himself or herself influencing perceptions of personal attributes akin to 
the process of assimilation and accommodation described by Jean Piaget.24 A prior study25 
has shown that stability and clarity in a person’s self-concept is positively correlated with 
extraversion, positive affect, and self-esteem. However, disruption of one’s self-concept 
creates dissonance between the perceived “actual” and “ideal” self, which can be associated 
with depression, anxiety, and neuroticism.23,26 Facial paralysis and the resultant facial 
deformity are examples of potential disruption. Ishii et al5,6 showed that patients with facial 
paralysis have impaired affect display and are considered less attractive. Moreover, the 
asymmetry associated with facial paralysis causes a measurable attentional distraction.8,27 
These findings underscore the potential negative implications of facial paralysis on social 
interactions. In a study by Bradbury et al28 involving structured patient interviews, 89.6% of 
patients with facial paralysis complained of intrusive questions regarding their appearance 
from strangers and acquaintances with half of the group experiencing psychological distress. 
These experiences damage a patient’s self-concept, deter social interactions, and promote 
social isolation.3 Consequently, patients internalizing these negative interactions may adjust 
their self-image. Our results support this concept because patients with facial paralysis had 
significantly lower self-reported attractiveness compared with patients without facial 
paralysis. Furthermore, the psychosocial distress associated with facial paralysis has the 
potential to result in depression.
Various studies have investigated the association of facial deformity and depression.4,29–31 
However, few studies have characterized the impact of facial paralysis on depression. In a 
retrospective study, Walker et al32 found that 40% of patients with facial paralysis showed 
symptoms suggestive of an anxiety or depressive mood disorder. Moreover, Pouwels et al33 
showed that 27% of patients with facial paralysis, either before or after surgery, were 
identified as having a depressive disorder. Similarly, we found that a significant proportion 
of the patients with facial paralysis screened positive for depression at initial evaluation 
compared with control patients. Furthermore, our results demonstrate a significantly 
increased likelihood of patients screening positive for depression in those presenting with 
more severe paralysis (ie, HB grade ≥3).
In the present study, we further describe the association of facial paralysis and depression by 
presenting a statistical model showing that patients with facial paralysis are significantly 
associated with an increase in depression scores. Regression quantified the effect of facial 
paralysis while accounting for the impact of female sex, a known confounder for depression 
(Table 4).14 These findings suggest that clinicians evaluating patients seeking treatment for

 facial paralysis may wish to consider either formal or informal screening for depression, 
particularly in patients with HB grade 3 or greater paralysis. In doing so, clinicians can 
identify patients who are at greater risk for postoperative dissatisfaction given the underlying 
depressive disorder, which may ultimately lead to happier patients.28,34 Importantly, 
clinicians may even refer patients to the appropriate psychiatric services, mitigating the 
significant costs and morbidity associated with untreated depression.35–37
Patients often seek treatment for facial paralysis in hopes of restoring their QOL. Several 
studies have examined the association between facial paralysis and QOL.20,21,38,39 In 2 
cross-sectional studies assessing QOL in patients with acoustic neuroma, Ryzenman et al21 
found that 28% of patients were significantly affected by facial weakness, and Lee et al38 
found a significantly lower QOL scores in patients with facial paralysis compared with 
normal patients. Looking at patients with all-cause facial paralysis at initial presentation, 
Kleiss et al20 found that patients with facial paralysis have a mean (SD) baseline Facial 
Clinimetric Evaluation score of 47.3 (19.2) representing health-related QOL on a scale of 0 
to 100. Our study expands on these findings by comparing QOL scores between patients 
with all-cause facial paralysis and control patients and presenting a model showing that 
QOL scores are significantly affected by facial paralysis. Relative to the average QOL scores 
reported by the US population (81–87 out of 100), our results demonstrate a significant 
decrease in QOL for patients with facial paralysis (Table 4).40 These findings emphasize the 
importance of considering QOL when treating patients with facial paralysis to achieve our 
goal of optimizing patient outcomes.
Limitations
There are several limitations when examining the associations among depression, QOL, and 
facial paralysis. First, we could not capture all patients with facial paralysis in the 
population. We were limited to assessing patients seeking treatment for facial paralysis, 
which may differ psychologically from patients who do not present for evaluation. It is 
possible that patients presenting for treatment are inherently predisposed to increased 
psychosocial distress compared with the other patients with facial paralysis. Next, our study 
does not consider duration of paralysis at the time of presentation when assessing 
depression. However, prior studies32,41 report mixed results regarding the association 
between duration of paralysis and mood disorders. In addition, our study relies on specific 
subjective psychometric instruments to infer the complex, multifaceted domains of QOL and 
depression. We likely missed other factors affecting these domains. Yet, we can account for 
these variables in the residual variance of our regression model. Finally, the population in 
this study included only patients presenting to a facial plastic surgery clinic, which limits the 
generalizability of the results.
Nonetheless, these data demonstrate that patients with facial paralysis are significantly 
associated with lower QOL and higher depression scores. To better understand QOL and 
depression in the population of patients with facial paralysis, future investigations should 
strive to include both patients presenting to all clinicians and patients who do not present for 
evaluation. In addition, future studies may find patient predictors associated with a worse 
psychological response to facial paralysis. This may highlight the range of innate coping

 ability allowing patients to preserve their self-concept. In addition, further investigation is 
warranted to better characterize the effect of facial paralysis severity on psychological 
health. Finally, future prospective studies may examine the effect of facial reanimation 
surgery on depression and QOL. With the aim of providing patient-centered care to improve 
QOL, identifying patients with significant psychosocial distress resulting in depression 
allows clinician to deliver treatment potentially restoring facial appearance, mental health, 
and self-concept.
Conclusions
Facial paralysis was significantly associated with increased depression scores and worse 
QOL scores. Consistent with prior literature, female sex is also significantly associated with 
increased depression scores. Furthermore, there is no significant association between facial 
paralysis etiology and screening positive for depression. However, patients with more severe 
facial paralysis (HB grade ≥3) were more likely to screen positive for depression. Clinicians 
initially evaluating patients seeking treatment for facial paralysis should consider the 
psychological impact of facial paralysis to better direct patients to the appropriate 
psychiatric services if required.

 Key Points
Question
What is the association between facial paralysis, depression, and quality of life in patients 
seeking treatment by a facial plastic reconstructive surgeon?
Findings
In study of 263 patients, patients seeking treatment for facial paralysis were significantly 
associated with higher depression scores and lower quality-of-life scores compared with 
patients without facial paralysis. Moreover, patients with greater severity of facial 
paralysis were significantly more likely to screen positive for depression.
Meaning
Clinicians initially evaluating patients should consider the psychological impact of facial 
paralysis to better direct patients to appropriate services if needed.
