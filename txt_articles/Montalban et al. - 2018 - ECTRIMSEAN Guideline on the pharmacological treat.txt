Background and scope
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory-demyeli-
nating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) 
that is characterized by inflammation, demyelination 
and degenerative changes. MS usually begins around 
the age between 20 and 40 years and affects two to 
three times as many women as men; it also constitutes 
the most frequent cause of non-traumatic disability in 
the young adult population.1 The incidence of MS 
varies across regions, with rates as high as 8 to 10 new 
cases per 100,000 in high latitudinal regions.2,3 
Current estimates suggest that over 700,000 people 
are affected in Europe, with over 2.5 million cases 
worldwide,4 which represent a significant burden in 
terms of impact on quality of life, societal costs and 
personal expenses.5,6 Most patients (85%–90%) have 
a relapsing course from onset that is characterized by 
relapses and remissions of neurological symptoms

Abstract
Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex disease with new drugs becoming available in the 
past years. There is a need for a reference tool compiling current data to aid professionals in treatment 
decisions.
Objectives: To develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the pharmacological treatment 
of people with MS.
Methods: This guideline has been developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and following the updated EAN recommendations. 
Clinical questions were formulated in Patients–Intervention–Comparator–Outcome (PICO) format and 
outcomes were prioritized. The quality of evidence was rated into four categories according to the risk of 
bias. The recommendations with assigned strength (strong and weak) were formulated based on the qual-
ity of evidence and the risk-benefit balance. Consensus between the panelists was reached by use of the 
modified nominal group technique.
Results: A total of 10 questions were agreed, encompassing treatment efficacy, response criteria, strate-
gies to address suboptimal response and safety concerns and treatment strategies in MS and pregnancy. 
The guideline takes into account all disease-modifying drugs approved by the European Medicine Agency 
(EMA) at the time of publication. A total of 21 recommendations were agreed by the guideline working 
group after three rounds of consensus.
Conclusion: The present guideline will enable homogeneity of treatment decisions across Europe.
Keywords: Multiple sclerosis, guideline, disease-modifying therapies, GRADE methodology

associated with areas of CNS inflammation, and over 
the course of two decades, more than half of untreated 
patients transition to a phase of gradual worsening 
independent of acute attacks.7,8 Progressive forms of 
MS can be present as the initial disease course (pri-
mary-progressive MS) in approximately 10%–15% of 
patients.9,10
There is no curative treatment available for MS, and 
the current therapeutic strategy is aimed at reducing 
the risk of relapses and potentially disability progres-
sion. The treatment era for MS began in 1993, when 
the first interferon became available, and recent years 
have seen a large expansion in the therapeutic options 
for MS, with 11 disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) 
approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) 
in both injectable and oral formulations by the begin-
ning of 2017.11 The growing armamentarium of thera-
pies brings new opportunities for individualized 
therapy where patients and providers must balance 
considerations around efficacy, side effects and poten-
tial harm in a shared-decision process. However, the 
variety of mechanisms of action, monitoring require-
ments and risk profiles together with the existing 
knowledge gaps make individualized medicine a 
complex task.12,13 There is still controversy about the 
relative efficacy of the drugs available, who should 
receive therapy and the optimum time to start. The 
heterogeneity of MS together with the changes in the 
diagnostic criteria over the years14–17 and the recent 
redefinition of the clinical subtypes18 hamper direct 
comparisons across studies for different drugs. 
Moreover, despite the identification of several prog-
nostic factors,19–21 there is no accepted consensus 
definition that allows physicians to classify patients 
into ‘high-risk’ and ‘low-risk’ groups in order to pri-
oritize treatment strategies.
A number of evidence-based guidelines and technol-
ogy appraisal documents have been produced over the 
past 5 years,22–25 but there is no comprehensive docu-
ment that incorporates recently approved drugs to 
help clinicians and patients in the decision-making 
process for those aspects that raise specific difficul-
ties when facing everyday clinical practice. These are 
questions such as how to select the initial therapy and 
choose subsequent therapies; how to best monitor 
treatment response; when to switch or discontinue 
treatment; and how to manage therapy in special situ-
ations such as pregnancy. In this context, the European 
Committee of Treatment and Research in Multiple 
Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the European Academy of 
Neurology (EAN) have joined forces to provide up-
to-date, evidence-based recommendations for the 
treatment of patients with MS to assist physicians, 
patients, health-care providers and health-policy mak-
ers in Europe and worldwide in the decision-making 
process.
This guideline focuses on disease-modifying treat-
ment for the adult population with MS, including all 
immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive drugs 
authorized by the EMA. It does not include recom-
mendations concerning combination therapies or new 
active agents in the final stages of clinical evaluation 
that are not approved by the EMA at the time of pub-
lication. Nevertheless, the available evidence regard-
ing these drugs has been analysed, and a regular 
update of the document is planned in order to incorpo-
rate new drugs in the recommendations as soon as 
they are approved. This guideline does not include 
treatments usually considered complementary and/or 
alternative medicine or aspects of symptomatic treat-
ment and/or treatment of relapses.
Patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) who 
do not fulfil the current MS 2010 diagnostic criteria 
and patients with confirmed MS have been consid-
ered, distinguishing between the different clinical 
subtypes of MS using previous and recent classifica-
tion criteria.18,26 Guidance relating to paediatric MS is 
not included in this guideline and can be found in 
recent documents.27–30
The document is a joint venture of ECTRIMS and 
EAN and, as such, the recommendations have been 
drawn up considering its European scope, including 
both the outpatient and in-hospital setting, but it does 
not address specific organizational issues, manage-
ment models or country-specific regulations required 
to implement the recommendations. Users of these 
guidelines should adapt the recommendations to be 
consistent with their local regulations and/or team 
capacities, infrastructure and cost-benefit strategies.
Guideline questions
The guideline task force, on the basis of its large exper-
tise in the field, has prioritized the key aspects to be 
covered in the guideline. These aspects are as follows: 
early treatment in CIS patients, treatment in patients 
with established disease (both relapsing and progres-
sive), monitoring of treatment response, treatment 
strategies in case of inadequate treatment response, 
treatment discontinuation and/or switch as well as 
treatment in special situations such as pregnancy.
To address the previous topics, 10 questions have been 
formulated and classified into the two following types: 
those involving a specific therapeutic intervention,

formulated following the Patients–Intervention– 
Comparator–Outcome (PICO) framework, and those 
covering aspects of clinical management, formulated 
considering population, management aspect and 
outcome.
An explicit list of outcomes for each question was 
proposed by the guideline chairs and circulated to the 
rest of the working group who were invited to rate 
their relative importance for clinical decision-making 
and add new outcomes if needed. The outcome prior-
itization was performed via a two-round consensus 
exercise using a 9-point Likert scale and grouped into 
three categories (1–3: outcome of low importance; 
4–6: outcome important but not critical for decision-
making and 7–9: outcome critical for decision-mak-
ing). Only outcomes graded as critical or important 
according to expert opinion were analysed.
Therapeutic intervention questions
1. In patients with CIS (regardless of whether 
they fulfil criteria of definite MS),15 what is the 
benefit of starting treatment with a disease-
modifying drug (DMD) compared to no 
treatment?
2. In patients with relapsing–remitting multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS) and secondary-progressive 
MS, what is the benefit of treating with a DMD 
compared to no treatment/another DMD?
3. In patients with primary-progressive MS, what 
is the benefit of treating with a DMD compared 
to no treatment?
Clinical management questions
4.  In patients with relapsing MS treated with 
DMDs, does the presence of early disease 
activity (relapses and/or disability progression 
and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
activity at 6 months/12 months) predict an 
increased risk of future disability?
5.  In MS patients treated with DMDs, should a 
follow-up MRI be performed within a pre-
specified time frame to monitor treatment 
response and safety?
6.  In patients with relapsing MS treated with 
interferon or glatiramer acetate and with evi-
dence of early disease activity (relapses and/or 
disability progression and/or MRI activity at 
6/12 months), what is the benefit of switching 
between interferon and glatiramer acetate ver-
sus moving to more efficacious drugs?
7.  In patients with relapsing MS who stop taking 
a highly efficacious drug, is there a risk of 
return and/or rebound of their disease activity 
(increased risk of relapses, disability progres-
sion and/or MRI activity)?
8.  In patients with relapsing MS who stop taking 
a highly efficacious drug, what is the benefit of 
further treatment?
9.  In patients with relapsing MS treated with 
DMDs that remain stable over a long time 
period, what is the benefit of continuing treat-
ment compared to stopping?
10. In women with MS treated with DMDs who 
wish to become pregnant or who have an 
unplanned pregnancy, what should the thera-
peutic approach be?
Methodology
This guideline was developed in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
Working Group31 and in line with the 2015 Practical 
recommendations for the process of proposing, plan-
ning and writing a neurological management guide-
line by EAN task forces.32
Search strategy
Searches were performed following a predefined 
review protocol (Supplementary Appendix 1) and con-
ducted in the following databases: The Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central), 
Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), Medical 
Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online 
(MEDLINE)/MEDLINE In-Process and Psychological 
Information Database (PsycINFO). All search terms for 
each search are listed in Supplementary Appendix 2.
Titles and abstracts of identified studies were 
screened for inclusion against agreed criteria. 
Eligibility criteria for therapeutic intervention ques-
tions included systematic review (SR), randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) with at least 1 year follow-up 
(48 weeks acceptable) and long-term extensions on 
included RCTs. Studies on paediatric population, 
studies evaluating combination of drugs, unlicensed 
doses, those published in non-English language and 
those with <10 participants per arm were excluded. 
For clinical management questions, we included SR, 
RCTs and observational studies. Exclusion criteria 
varied between the different clinical management 
questions and details can be found in Supplementary 
Appendix 1.
All primary-level studies included after the first scan 
of citations were acquired in full and re-evaluated for

eligibility at the time they were entered into a study 
database (standardized template created in Microsoft 
Excel). The full-text papers were screened by two 
reviewers using the inclusion criteria for reference. 
Study characteristics, aspects of methodological qual-
ity and outcome data were extracted from all eligible 
studies using an Excel-based form and Review 
Manager Version 5.3.
Quality appraisal and data synthesis
The quality appraisal process was conducted depend-
ing on the study design using available standardized 
tools. For the evidence coming from RCTs, the qual-
ity of individual studies was assessed using the 
Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of 
bias in randomized trials.33 For cohort studies, the 
Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies – of 
Interven 
tions (ROBINS-I; Cochrane Bias Methods 
Group)34 was used, whereas for before-and-after stud-
ies, the ‘Quality Assessment of Before-After (Pre-
Post) Studies With No Control Group’ tool developed 
by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and 
the Research Triangle Institute International was 
used. SRs were assessed using the ‘Assessing the 
Methodo 
logical Quality of Systematic Reviews 
(AMSTAR)’ tool. For RCTs, meta-analysis using a 
random-effects model was used to combine results 
from similar studies using Review Manager Version 
5.3. Where application of this analysis was not possi-
ble, a narrative synthesis was used. Observational 
studies were analysed separately from the RCTs and 
synthesized narratively. Dichotomous outcomes were 
analysed as relative risks (RR; also called a risk ratio), 
and continuous outcomes were analysed using the 
mean difference (MD) with the associated 95% confi-
dence interval (CI).
Grading the quality of the evidence
The process for grading the quality of the evidence 
followed two different approaches according to the 
type of question.
Therapeutic intervention. For questions about 
 
the effectiveness of interventions, the GRADE 
approach was used to assess the quality of evi-
dence for each outcome35 taking into account the 
following items: study design, risk of bias, incon-
sistency, indirectness and imprecision. GRADE 
evidence profiles, including both the quality of the 
evidence and the results of the evidence synthesis 
for each ‘critical and important’ outcome, were 
created using GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro) soft-
ware (Version 3.6).
Clinical management. For the clinical management 
questions, the risk of bias was assessed using different 
tools depending on study design as detailed previ-
ously, and this information was presented narratively 
and in summary tables.
Method for reaching consensus
The panel formulated practice recommendations 
 
on the basis of the quality of the evidence and the 
 
balance between health benefits and harms for both 
therapeutic and clinical management questions. Con-
sensus was reached by use of the modified nominal 
group technique following a two-stage process.36 In 
the first stage, participants received a summary of the 
available evidence and its quality as detailed previ-
ously, an overview of the modified nominal group 
technique, and a ranking excel sheet containing the 
proposed list of statements and instructions on its use. 
The proposed list of statements and their assigned 
strength (strong and weak) was initially drafted by the 
guideline chairs during a face-to-face meeting with 
participation of the methodologists in charge of the 
evidence analysis. For those aspects for which there 
was no sufficient evidence to support a formal recom-
mendation, consensus statements were formulated.
The panel members were asked to indicate their agree-
ment with the set of statements by taking into account 
the available evidence and their expertise and to pro-
vide written comment on their reason for any disagree-
ment and possible modifications. The statements were 
rated on a 9-point Likert scale and grouped into three 
categories (1–3: inappropriate strategy; 4–6: uncertain 
and 7–9: appropriate strategy). In the second stage, 
panellists met during a face-to-face consensus meeting, 
and anonymized distributions of responses to each 
statement were presented to all members, together with 
the additional comments and a ranking of statements. 
Those statements with less than 80% agreement were 
redrafted, and a second round of voting using show of 
hands was conducted. If agreement of 80% or above 
was achieved, then the rerated statements were 
adopted.37 Those statements that could not be approved 
during the face-to-face meeting due to time limitations 
were evaluated in a third round via e-mail.

An electronic database search was performed for 
questions 1–3 simultaneously and identified 4416 
records. Of these, 4266 studies were excluded based 
on their title/abstract and 150 studies were subjected 
to a full-text appraisal. Information about the excluded 
studies can be found in Supplementary Appendix 3. 
Five trials38–42 and their extensions43–48 met the eligi-
bility criteria for question number one. They were all 
placebo-controlled trials testing interferon, glatiramer 
acetate and teriflunomide. Sample sizes of the pivotal 
trials varied from 383 to 618 participants (mean = 493), 
with a follow-up ranging from 104 to 156 weeks 
(mean: 125 weeks). All trials included participants 
who had not received any prior DMT before study 
entry, and the mean Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS) scores at baseline ranged from 1 to 1.67 
(mean: 1.42). Further details about the characteristics 
of the included studies can be found in Supplementary 
Appendix 4 – Tables 1–5.
Three trials38,40,41 (N = 1368) comparing interferon 
with placebo showed a reduced time to conversion to 
clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) at 
2 years (high-quality meta-analysis, 2 trials;38,41 
n = 808; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.38–0.64) 
and a reduced number of participants converting to 
CDMS at follow-ups ranging from 2 to 3 years (mod-
erate-quality meta-analysis, two trials;38,40 n = 723; 
RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.61–0.82). Treatment with 
interferon also showed a benefit in a number of par-
ticipants free from new or newly enlarging T2 lesions 
and gadolinium (GAD)-enhanced lesions, but MRI 
results could not be combined into meta-analyses due 
to the variability of MRI outcomes reported across the 
three trials. The interferon group resulted in a higher 
but non-significant discontinuation risk due to any 
reason (moderate-quality meta-analysis, three tri-
als;38,40,41 n = 1193; RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.80–1.54) 
and a higher discontinuation risk due to side effects 
(low-quality meta-analysis, two trials;40,41 n = 810; 
RR = 2.17, 95% CI: 0.16–28.82). In the extension 
studies, patients on placebo were offered interferon. 
The early-intervention group showed a greater time to 
conversion to CDMS than the delayed-treatment 
group at 3 years’ follow-up,47 and this difference was 
maintained at 5,45,48 846 and 11 years’ follow-up.44
There is only one available trial of glatiramer acetate 
compared with placebo (n = 481) in CIS patients 
showing a delayed conversion to CDMS at 3 years 
(moderate quality; HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.40–0.76), 
with a higher number of discontinuations in the glati-
ramer acetate group due to any reason (moderate 
quality, RR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.02–2.69) and due to 
side effects (moderate quality, RR = 3.43, 95% CI: 
1.14–10.26).39 According to a single-extension study, 
there was a beneficial effect of early treatment with 
glatiramer acetate on the time to CDMS, number of 
new or newly enlarging T2 lesions, number of GAD 
lesions and brain volume change, with no significant 
differences in adverse events at 5 years’ follow-up.43
According to a single placebo-controlled trial 
(N = 413), treatment of CIS patients with terifluno-
mide resulted in a delayed time to conversion to 
CDMS (low quality, HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38–0.87) 
and a reduced number of participants converting to 
CDMS at 2 years’ follow-up (low quality, RR = 0.64, 
95% CI: 0.44–0.92). MRI outcomes showed a lower 
number of GAD lesions (low quality, MD = −0.56, 
95% CI: −1.04 to −0.08) and a beneficial effect on the 
change in T2 lesion volume (low quality, MD = −0.07, 
95% CI: −0.18 to 0.03), with no difference between 
groups in brain atrophy. The study reported a higher 
number of non-significant discontinuations in the pla-
cebo group due to any reason (RR = 0.83, 95% CI: 
0.60–1.15) and due to side effects (RR = 0.91, 95% 
CI: 0.49–1.70).42 GRADE tables and Forest plots are 
presented in Supplementary Appendices 5 and 6. 
Further details about the safety issues of these drugs 
are shown in Supplementary Appendix 7.
Review question 2: In patients with RRMS and second-
ary-progressive MS, what is the benefit of treating with 
a DMD compared to no treatment/another DMD?
A total of 33 RCTs met the eligibility criteria for ques-
tion number two, and of these, 28 RCTs included 
patients with relapsing–remitting forms of MS (some 
of which included patients with and without progres-
sion) and 5 RTCs were restricted to patients with sec-
ondary-progressive MS.
RRMS. The trials on RRMS comprised 16 placebo-
controlled trials, including interferon, glatiramer 
acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, fingoli-
mod, natalizumab, cladribine and daclizumab, and 12 
head-to-head trials involving many of these agents 
and including alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab. Sam-
ple sizes ranged from 75 to 2244 participants (mean: 
879), and the length of study follow-up ranged from 
48 to 260 weeks (mean: 98 weeks). Overall, partici-
pants were predominantly female (mean of means: 
70%) in their late 30s (mean of means: 36 years) who 
had been diagnosed with MS for an average of 
5.3 years (range: 1.1–10.6 years). In all, 22 studies 
reported the number of participants who had received 
any DMD prior to study entry, which was 0% in five 
studies, 100% in one study, and ranged from 7.6% to 
75% in the remaining 16 studies (mean of means:

32%). At baseline, the EDSS scores ranged from 1.9 
to 2.9 (mean of means: 2.5), and the number of 
relapses in the previous year ranged from 1 to 1.8 
(mean of means: 1.4). Further details about the char-
acteristics of the included studies can be found in 
Supplementary Appendix 4 – Tables 6–25.
All the evaluated drugs showed a significant treat-
ment effect compared with placebo. Interferon 
resulted in a lower annualized relapse rate at follow-
up ranging from 48 to 104 weeks (moderate-quality 
meta-analysis, 2 trials;49,50 n = 1909; MD = −0.10, 
95% CI: −0.16 to −0.04) and a beneficial effect on the 
number of participants free from relapse at 48 weeks’ 
follow-up (moderate-quality evidence; RR = 1.15, 
95% CI: 1.08–1.23)49 and at 104 weeks’ follow-up 
(low-quality meta-analysis; three trials51–53 (n = 960; 
RR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.35–2.21). Interferon had an 
impact on disability worsening confirmed at 3 months 
over 48 weeks’ follow-up (low-quality evidence; 
RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39–0.93; n = 1012)49 and on dis-
ability worsening confirmed at 6 months over 2 years’ 
follow-up (low-quality evidence meta-analysis; two 
trials;50,53 RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51–0.98; k = 2; 
n = 1069). Interferon also showed an impact on MRI 
parameters, according to moderate-quality evidence, 
with fewer new or newly enlarging T2 lesions 
(MD = −7.30, 95% CI: −8.85 to −5.75)49 and a change 
in brain volume at 48 weeks’ follow-up (MD = −0.10, 
95% CI: −0.20 to 0.00)49 and at 2 years’ follow-up 
(MD = −0.11, 95% CI: −0.28 to 0.06).50 Similarly, 
low-quality evidence suggested a larger proportion of 
participants free from T2 active lesions (RR = 2.80, 
95% CI: 1.69–4.63) and free from combined unique 
active lesions (RR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.49–5.92) at 
2 years.52 The evidence suggested an increased risk of 
trial discontinuation due to side effects and due to any 
reason in the interferon group compared with that in 
the placebo group at 48 weeks’49 and at 2 years’ fol-
low-up (low-quality evidence meta-analysis; three tri-
als;49,52,53 N = 1630; RR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.04–2.86).
Extension studies available for four of the inter-
feron pivotal trials concluded that the early-inter-
vention group had a lower annualized relapse rate 
and fewer new or newly enlarging T2 lesions at 2 
and 4 years’ follow-up,54,55 as well as a lower pro-
portion of participants with disability worsening at 
2 and 8 years’ follow-up.55,56 At 16 years’ follow-up, 
there was little difference between the early- and 
delayed-treatment groups in the number of partici-
pants reaching an EDSS score of 6 and those con-
verting to secondary-progressive MS.57 Further 
details about the study outcomes can be found in 
Supplementary Appendix 8.
Three trials (N = 3217) compared glatiramer acetate 
with placebo with length of follow-up ranging from 52 
to 104 weeks.58–60 Glatiramer acetate resulted in a 
lower annualized relapse rate at follow-ups ranging 
from 52 to 96 weeks (moderate-quality evidence meta-
analysis of two trials;58,60 n = 2117; MD = −0.14, 95% 
CI: −0.21 to −0.06) and a higher proportion of partici-
pants free from relapse at follow-ups ranging from 1 to 
2 years (moderate-quality evidence meta-analysis of 
three trials;58–60 n = 2360; RR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.10–
1.24). There was a non-statistically significant evi-
dence effect on disability at 96 to 104 weeks’ follow-up 
(low-quality evidence meta-analysis of two trials;58,59 
n = 964; 
RR = 0.86, 
95% 
CI = 0.66–1.11) 
and 
128 weeks’ follow-up (low-quality evidence meta-
analysis of two trials;58,59 n = 964; RR = 0.79, 95% CI; 
0.52–1.20). Glatiramer acetate resulted in a lower 
number of cumulative GAD lesions (MD = −0.73, 
95% CI: −1.15 to −0.31) and cumulative new or newly 
enlarging T2 lesions at 6 and 12 months’ follow-up58,60 
as well as a beneficial (but non-statistically signifi-
cant) effect on the percent change in brain volume at 
1 year, according to high-quality evidence (MD = −0.06, 
95% CI: −0.19 to 0.06).60 According to the only avail-
able extension study, there was little difference 
between groups in the proportion of participants dis-
continuing the trial for any reason during the extension 
phase. The early-treatment group had a higher propor-
tion of injection site reactions (2.4% vs 0.9%).61
Two trials compared teriflunomide with placebo with 
length of follow-up ranging from 104 to 108 weeks.62,63 
According to moderate-quality evidence meta-analy-
sis of the two trials (n = 1479), teriflunomide reduced 
the risk of relapses (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.16–1.36), 
resulted in a decreased annualized relapse rate 
(MD = −0.18, 95% CI: −0.24 to −0.11) and reduced 
disability worsening compared with those associated 
with placebo (RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.62–0.93) at 48–
108 weeks’ follow-up. Only one of the trials reported 
MRI data that showed a beneficial effect on the mean 
number of GAD lesions (MD = −1.07, 95% CI: −1.40 
to −0.74) and on the number of patients free from 
enhanced 
lesions 
(moderate-quality 
evidence, 
RR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.39–1.87).63 In the single-exten-
sion study available, there was little difference up to 
9 years’ follow-up between the early- and delayed-
treatment groups for the annualized relapse rate and a 
lower proportion of participants with disability wors-
ening in the early-treatment group.64
Two trials (n = 2667) compared dimethyl fumarate 
with placebo with length of follow-up ranging from 96 
to 104 weeks.58,65 A moderate-quality meta-analysis of 
both trials (n = 1479) showed a beneficial effect of 
 Multiple Sclerosis Journal 24(2)

dimethyl fumarate at 2 years’ follow-up on the number 
of participants free from relapses (RR = 1.28, 95% CI: 
1.14–1.43), the annualized relapse rate (MD = −0.19, 
95% CI: −0.25 to −0.13), the risk of disability worsen-
ing (RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.85) and the presence 
of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions (MD = −13.36, 
95% CI: −16.63 to −10.9) and GAD lesions 
(MD = −1.64, 95% CI: −2.17 to −1.10). One extension 
study reported outcomes at 5 years with the previous 
trials combined, where participants receiving placebo 
were re-randomized to one of the two doses of dime-
thyl fumarate. The results indicated little difference 
between the early- and delayed-treatment groups for 
the annualized relapse rate during the extension phase 
and a lower proportion of participants with disability 
worsening in the early-treatment group.66
Two trials compared fingolimod with placebo with 
104 weeks’ follow-up.67,68 According to a meta-analy-
sis of both trials (n = 2355), moderate-quality evi-
dence showed that fingolimod was associated with a 
larger proportion of participants free from relapse 
(RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.28–1.63), a lower annualized 
relapse rate (MD = −0.21, 95% CI: −0.25 to −0.16), 
lower risk of disability worsening (RR = 0.71, 95% 
CI: 0.56–0.90) and a trend in favour of fingolimod for 
all MRI outcomes. The extension studies available for 
both trials show a beneficial effect in the early-treat-
ment group compared with that in the delayed-treat-
ment group with a lower annualized relapse rate, a 
higher proportion of participants free from disability 
worsening and a beneficial effect of early fingolimod 
on the number of new T2 lesions, GAD lesions and 
the percent change in brain volume at 4–6 years’ and 
4.5 years’ follow-up.69
One trial (n = 942) compared natalizumab with pla-
cebo for 104 weeks.70 High-quality evidence from a 
single trial indicated a higher number of participants 
free from relapse (RR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.40–1.81), a 
lower annualized relapse rate (MD = −0.50, 95% CI: 
−0.63 to −0.37), fewer GAD lesions (RR = −1.10, 
95% CI: −1.54 to −0.66) and new or newly enlarging 
T2 lesions (RR = −9.10, 95% CI: −10.98 to −7.22) in 
the natalizumab group. Moderate-quality evidence 
suggested a beneficial effect on the number of partici-
pants with disability worsening (RR = 0.59, 95% CI: 
0.46–0.75).
One trial (n = 621) compared daclizumab with pla-
cebo for 52 weeks71 and indicated a lower annualized 
relapse rate (high-quality evidence, MD = −0.25, 95% 
CI: −0.37 to −0.13), a higher proportion of patients 
free from relapse (high-quality evidence, RR = 1.25, 
95% CI: 1.11 to 1.42), and a lower mean number of 
GAD lesions (moderate-quality evidence, MD = −1.10, 
95% CI: −1.45 to −0.75) and new or newly enlarging 
T2 lesions in the daclizumab group. Low-quality evi-
dence from the same trial indicated a reduced risk of 
disability worsening (RR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.22–0.85). 
In the extension study, the participants receiving pla-
cebo were re-randomized at 2 years’ post-randomiza-
tion of the SELECT trial to receive 150 or 300 mg of 
daclizumab, while those already receiving the investi-
gational drug were re-randomized to continue with 
their present dose or undergo a 20-week wash-out and 
subsequent reinitiation of the drug.72 The results indi-
cated a lower annualized relapse rate and fewer new 
T2 lesions in the continuous, wash-out and reinitia-
tion groups than in the delayed-treatment group at 
2 years’ follow-up.
One trial (n = 1326) compared cladribine with placebo 
for 96 weeks.73 High-quality evidence from a single 
trial indicated a higher number of participants free 
from relapse (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.20–1.42) and a 
lower annualized relapse rate (MD = −0.19, 95% CI: 
−0.23 to −0.14) in the intervention group. The authors 
reported statistically significant reductions in GAD 
lesions, active T2 lesions and combined unique 
lesions in the intervention group compared with pla-
cebo (p < 0.0001).
Head-to-head comparisons. These are available only 
for interferon, glatiramer acetate and natalizumab. 
Head-to-head comparisons between glatiramer ace-
tate and interferon are available from four trials,74–77 
with the length of follow-up ranging from 52 to 
104 weeks. There was no difference in the number of 
participants free from relapse at 2 years’ follow-up 
(moderate-quality evidence meta-analysis of three tri-
als;74,76,77 n = 2175; RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.90–1.06) or 
disability worsening (RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.83–1.31), 
according to moderate-quality evidence from a single 
trial.77 At 2 years’ follow-up, a low-quality meta-anal-
ysis of the four trials (n = 2341)74–77 indicated that 
fewer people in the glatiramer acetate group discon-
tinued due to any reason (RR = 1.30, 95% CI: 0.68–
2.47) and due to side effects (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 
0.75–1.77) than in the interferon group, although the 
data were imprecise and the differences were not 
significant.
Teriflunomide, fingolimod and daclizumab were 
compared with interferon in single trials. There was a 
higher proportion of participants free from relapse in 
the interferon group (N = 342; RR = 0.68, 95% CI: 
0.57–0.82) than in the teriflunomide group, with little 
difference between groups in the annualized relapse 
rate at 48 weeks’ follow-up, according to low-quality

evidence.78 Moderate-quality evidence showed more 
participants free from relapse (n = 1292; RR = 1.19, 
95% CI: 1.11–1.29), a lower annualized relapse rate 
(MD = −0.17, 95% CI: −0.26 to −0.08) and fewer par-
ticipants with disability worsening in the fingolimod 
group than in the placebo group at 1 year; however, 
the estimate was imprecise and not significant. MRI 
outcomes consistently favoured the fingolimod 
group.79 Two extension studies at 280 and 4.5 years81 
after the start of the original trial reported that early 
treatment showed a significant effect on the annual-
ized relapse at 2 years with no significant differences 
for the annualized relapse or for disability worsening 
and little difference in the number of new T2 lesions, 
GAD lesions and percent change in brain volume at 
4.5 years’ follow-up. Compared with interferon, dacli-
zumab resulted in more participants free from relapse 
(n = 1841; RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.22–1.42), a lower 
annualized relapse rate (MD = −0.17, 95% CI: −0.22 
to −0.12), a reduced risk of disability worsening 
(RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.66–0.98) and a lower mean 
number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions 
(MD = −5.20, 95% CI: −6.30 to −4.10) at 144 weeks’ 
follow-up, according to moderate-quality evidence.82
Three trials (n = 1755) compared alemtuzumab with 
interferon, with follow-ups ranging from 104 to 
260 weeks.83–85 There was a higher proportion of par-
ticipants free from relapse (moderate-quality evidence 
meta-analysis of three trials;83–85 n = 1414; RR = 1.38, 
95% CI: 1.26–1.51) and a lower annualized relapse 
rate (moderate-quality evidence meta-analysis of two 
trials;84,85 n = 851; MD = −0.25, 95% CI: −0.33 to 
−0.18) in the alemtuzumab group at follow-ups rang-
ing from 2 to 3 years. The effect on the annualized 
relapse in the alemtuzumab group (MD = −0.23, 95% 
CI: −0.30 to −0.16) was maintained at 5 years accord-
ing to low-quality evidence from a single study.84 
Moreover, fewer participants in the alemtuzumab 
group had disability worsening at 2 to 3 years’ (low-
quality evidence meta-analysis of three trials;83–85 
n = 1414; RR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40–0.86) and at 5 years’ 
follow-up (RR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.24–0.78).84 Meta-
analysis of the MRI data reported in two of the 
 
trials 84,85 showed a substantial and significant hetero-
geneity in the findings (I2 = 81%, p = 0.02) due to the dif-
ferent proportion of participants in the interferon group 
with new or newly enlarging T2 lesions. Considering 
each study individually, there was moderate evidence of 
a lower proportion of participants with a new or newly 
enlarging T2 in the alemtuzumab group, which was not 
statistically significant in one of the trials.83
Two trials (n = 1656) compared ocrelizumab with inter-
feron for 96 weeks.86 The annualized relapse rate was 
significantly lower in participants receiving ocreli-
zumab than in those receiving interferon (high-quality 
evidence, meta-analysis of two trials;86 n = 1656; 
MD = −0.13, 95% CI: −0.18 to −0.08), and a higher pro-
portion of participants with ocrelizumab showed disa-
bility improvement at the end of the trial when 
confirmed at 12 weeks (moderate-quality evidence, 
RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.04–1.68) and at 24 weeks (moder-
ate-quality evidence, RR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.02–1.79).
Secondary-progressive MS. Considering specifically 
those trials addressing secondary-progressive MS 
patients, five studies met the eligibility criteria 
(reported across seven papers) with sample sizes 
ranging from 194 to 939 participants and a 156-week 
follow-up for all trials. Overall, there was a higher 
proportion of women (58%) than men, the average 
age was 43 years and the participants had been diag-
nosed with MS for approximately 13 years (range: 
10–14.7 years). At baseline, the EDSS scores ranged 
from 4.8 to 5.4 (mean of means: 5.1). Interferon and 
mitoxantrone were the only DMDs studied. Further 
details about the characteristics of the included stud-
ies can be found in Supplementary Appendix 4 – 
Tables 26–28.
Four trials (N = 2646) compared interferon with pla-
cebo.87–90 At 3 years, there was a significant effect on 
disability 
worsening 
confirmed 
at 
3 months 
(RR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66–0.92)87 and a smaller effect 
on disability confirmed at 6 months (moderate-quality 
evidence meta-analysis of three trials;87,89,90 n = 1707; 
RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.80–1.06). These studies reported 
a higher proportion of participants free from com-
bined unique active lesions in the interferon group 
than in the placebo group (meta-analysis of two tri-
als;87,88 n = 970; RR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.17–2.49). The 
only available extension study reported outcomes at 
10 years after randomization in the core trial.91 
Patients who completed the core trial were offered 
interferon in an open-label extension for 18 months. 
Thereafter, treatment decisions were at the discretion 
of the treating physicians and the patient. Fewer par-
ticipants in the early-treatment group (29%) had pro-
gressed to an EDSS score of 8 or higher than in the 
delayed-treatment group (36.4%).
One trial (N = 194)92 compared mitoxantrone with 
placebo and reported a reduced risk of disability 
worsening (RR = 0.38, 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.99) at 
104 weeks. A small non-randomized subgroup of par-
ticipants in the trial underwent MRI scanning that 
showed no significant difference between the groups 
in the number of participants with positive GAD 
enhancement or in the number of GAD lesions at 1 or

2 years. The mean change from baseline of new 
T2-weighted lesions was significant at 2 years but not 
at 1 year.
GRADE tables and Forest plots are presented in 
Supplementary Appendices 5 and 6. Further details 
about the safety issues of these drugs are detailed in 
Supplementary Appendix 7.
Review question 3: In patients with primary-progres-
sive MS, what is the benefit of treating with a DMD 
compared to no treatment?
Five RCTs met the eligibility criteria for this review 
(reported across six papers),93–97 and all compared 
active drugs against placebo, with sample sizes rang-
ing from 50 to 970 participants (mean: 553) and a 
length of study follow-up ranging from 104 to 156 
weeks. Overall, just over half of the participants were 
male, and the average age was 47 years. Participants 
had been diagnosed with primary-progressive MS for 
an average of 6 years (range: 2.9 to 11.4 years) and at 
baseline, the EDSS scores ranged from 4.7 to 5.2 
(mean of means: 4.9). Further details about the char-
acteristics of the included studies can be found in 
Supplementary Appendix 4 – Tables 29–33.
Two available trials comparing interferon with pla-
cebo indicated little difference in the number of par-
ticipants with disability worsening (confirmed at 
3 months) at 2 years’ follow-up (low-quality evidence 
meta-analysis of two trials;93,95 n = 108; RR = 0.97, 
95% CI: 0.62–1.52). In the single available extension 
study, patients who completed the core trial were eli-
gible to enter the 5-year extension phase with no treat-
ment.98 There was no significant difference between 
early- and delayed-treatment in the proportion of par-
ticipants with disability worsening, in their cognitive 
performance (as measured with the Paced Auditory 
Serial Addition Test-3 (PASAT-3)) or in the change in 
T2 lesion volume. The authors reported a beneficial 
effect of early treatment on the change in brain paren-
chymal fraction.
Moderate-quality evidence of a single trial of glati-
ramer acetate compared with placebo (N = 2646) sug-
gested a non-significant effect on the number of 
participants with disability worsening (RR = 0.87, 
95% CI: 0.75–1.02) and a longer time to disability 
worsening (HR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.71–1.07) in the 
active treatment group at 156 weeks.97
Moderate-quality evidence of a single trial of fingoli-
mod compared with placebo (n = 970) indicated little 
difference between groups in the proportion of partici-
pants with disability worsening.94 Finally, a recently 
published trial (n = 732) compared ocrelizumab with 
placebo and showed high-quality evidence of greater 
time to disability worsening in the ocrelizumab group 
than in the placebo group at 120 weeks’ follow-up, 
when confirmed at 12 weeks (HR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59–
0.98) and 24 weeks (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58–0.97). 
The authors also reported evidence of benefit with ocre-
lizumab compared with placebo for the volume of 
hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images (HR = 0.90, 
95% CI: 0.88–0.92) and change in brain volume at 
120 weeks’ follow-up (HR = 17.5, 95% CI: 3.2–29.3).96
GRADE tables and Forest plots are presented in 
Supplementary Appendices 5 and 6. Further details 
about the safety issues of these drugs are detailed in 
Supplementary Appendix 7.
Quality assessment. All included studies in questions 
one to three were assessed for risk of bias. Sequence 
generation and allocation concealment were issues in 
most of the trials either because it was improperly 
conducted (causing high risk of bias) or because it 
was unclear according to the published information. 
Participants, personnel and outcome assessors were 
blind in most of the trials, with few exceptions that 
posed a high risk of bias.50,58,73,76,78,83–85,90 When consid-
ering incomplete outcome data, a few trials had a high 
risk of bias due to missing data for more than 20% of 
the study sample or due to unequal drop-out between 
intervention groups.42,62,65,67,68,75,77,78,82,87–90,92,94,96,99 
 
Outcome assessor bias and selective outcome report-
ing were also a problem in some trials, either due to 
not meeting requirements with a high risk of bias 
71,76,77,79 or because there was not enough information 
to make a judgement as no study protocols were avail-
able.51–53,59,75,93,95,97,99 See Supplementary Appendix 5 
for further details on quality assessment.
Recommendations
R1. The entire spectrum of DMDs should be pre-
scribed only in centres with adequate infrastructure to 
provide:
•
•
Proper monitoring of patients;
•
•
Comprehensive assessment;
•
•
Detection of side effects and capacity to address 
them promptly.
(consensus statement)
R2. Offer interferon or glatiramer acetate to patients 
with CIS and an abnormal MRI with lesions sugges-
tive of MS who do not fulfil criteria for MS.
(strong)

R3. Offer early treatment with DMDs to patients with 
active RRMS as defined by clinical relapses and/or 
MRI activity (active lesions–contrast-enhancing 
lesions; new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions 
assessed at least annually). Also includes CIS fulfill-
ing current diagnostic criteria for MS.
(strong)
R4. For active RRMS, choosing between the wide 
range of available drugs (interferon beta-1b, inter-
feron beta-1a -sc, im-, peginterferon beta-1a, glati-
ramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, 
cladribine, fingolimod, daclizumab, natalizumab, 
ocrelizumab and alemtuzumab) from the modestly 
effective to the highly efficacious, will depend on the 
following factors, in discussion with the patient:
•
•
Patient characteristics and comorbidities;
•
•
Disease severity/activity;
•
•
Drug safety profile;
•
•
Accessibility of the drug.
(consensus statement)
R5. Consider treatment with interferon-1a (sc) or -1b 
for patients with active secondary-progressive MS 
taking into account, in discussion with the patient, the 
dubious efficacy, as well as the safety and tolerability 
profile of these drugs.
(weak)
R6. Consider treatment with mitoxantrone for patients 
with active secondary-progressive MS taking into 
account, in discussion with the patient, the efficacy, 
and specifically the safety and tolerability profile of 
this agent.
(weak)
R7. Consider treatment with ocrelizumab or cladrib-
ine for patients with active secondary-progressive 
MS.
(weak)
R8. Consider treatment with ocrelizumab for patients 
with primary-progressive MS.

R9. Always consult the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC) for dosage, special warnings 
and precautions for use, contraindications and moni-
toring of side effects and potential harms.
(consensus statement)
Monitoring treatment response
Review question 4. In patients with relapsing MS 
treated with DMDs, does the presence of early disease 
activity (relapses and/or disability progression and/or 
MRI activity at 6 months/12 months) predict an 
increased risk of future disability?
One SR with the literature search up to 2014 met the 
inclusion criteria for this review.100 An updated elec-
tronic database search from January 2014 to December 
2016 identified 1653 records, and 1464 studies were 
excluded based on the title/abstract. After full-text 
appraisal of five studies, three met the eligibility cri-
teria101–103 and two were excluded.104,105 An additional 
targeted electronic database search assessing the pre-
dictive value of early ‘no evidence of disease activity 
(NEDA)’ on disability progression (criterion was not 
included in the previous SR) identified 244 records, 
but only one study met the inclusion criteria106 (see 
Supplementary Appendix 3).
The available SR100 described the criteria used in the 
literature to define long-term (≥2 years from start of 
treatment) and short-term (≤2 years from treatment 
initiation) non-response to interferon or glatiramer 
acetate and examined the predictive value of short-
term suboptimal response criteria (including EDSS 
score and/or an MRI parameter and/or relapse rate) 
for long-term non-response, at least 24 months after 
the start of treatment. Two additional studies not 
included in the previous SR used the Rio Score and 
the Modified Rio Score at 1 year to predict responses 
at 3103 and 5 years102 in MS patients treated with inter-
feron beta for at least 1 year. Sormani et al. pooled 
data from nine European MS centres that evaluated 
response to treatment at 3 years or more.101 The 
‘NEDA’ criteria were assessed yearly in a prospective 
cohort of CIS and RRMS patients to predict absence 
of disability worsening.106 Further details about the 
study characteristics and assessed criteria can be 
found in Supplementary Appendix 4 – Tables 34–36.
Overall, criteria that included MRI or MRI combined 
with clinical measures had a higher predictive value 
than clinical criteria alone. When considering only 
MRI criteria, measures of new/newly enlarging T2 
lesions outperformed those of GAD lesions. Of the 16 
criteria evaluated in the SR by Rio et al., the follow-
ing three were determined to have the best predictive 
value:
1. One or more new/newly enlarging T2 lesions;
2. Two or more new/newly enlarging T2 lesions;
3. Two or more criteria from the modified Rio 
score.
The presence of one or more new/newly enlarging 
 
T2 lesions for predicting EDSS worsening at 4–4.8 years’ 
follow-up resulted in a specificity of 70.2% and sensi-
tivity of 85.5% for one or more lesions and a speci-
ficity of 83.6% and sensitivity of 62.4% for two or 
more lesions, according to a meta-analysis of two

studies104,107 (n = 764). The presence of two or more cri-
teria from the modified Rio score had a specificity of 
89.1% and sensitivity of 26.4% in predicting EDSS 
worsening at 4 years’ follow-up, according to a meta-
analysis of two studies104,108 (n = 957). This result was 
confirmed in the study by Romero and colleagues; 
however, in the study by Hyun et al., the values for 
specificity and sensitivity appeared to be much higher. 
Rottstein in 2015 (n = 219) reported only the positive 
and negative predictive values of NEDA. The positive-
predictive value suggested that 71.7% of participants 
with NEDA at 1 year also had an absence of disability 
worsening at 7 years’ follow-up. The authors reported 
only the lowest (40.7%) and highest (43.1%) negative 
predictive value of NEDA between years’ 2–6. Tables 
with descriptive results corresponding to this question 
are presented in Supplementary Appendix 9.
Quality assessment. Using criteria from the 
AMSTAR 
tool, the SR was rated as low quality. This was due to 
the absence of reported information, namely, the 
study characteristics of included studies, an excluded 
studies list and a quality assessment of included stud-
ies. The primary studies were assessed with the 
Cochrane tool for ‘ROBINS-I’. All four studies were 
judged as having a moderate risk of bias. This was 
mainly due to a lack of information about missing 
data and potential confounding factors.
Review question 5. In MS patients treated with DMDs, 
should a follow-up MRI be performed in a pre-speci-
fied time scheme to monitor treatment response and 
safety?
No studies assessing the value of different MRI moni-
toring schemes for treatment response and safety 
were found. The use of MRI in the routine follow-up 
of patients with MS is, to date, less straightforward 
than in the diagnostic process. In the studies that 
assessed treatment response criteria (described in 
question 4), the MRI evaluation was performed at 
6–12 months after treatment initiation and compared 
with a baseline MRI carried out at or prior to treat-
ment onset.
Currently, there are several guidelines that aim to 
define the indications and frequency of MRI for mon-
itoring the disease course in patients with an estab-
lished diagnosis of MS.109,110 Only the most recent 
guideline, developed by the MAGNIMS group, cov-
ers specific aspects regarding the use of MRI for 
 
monitoring treatment response and safety.111 The 
guideline Steering Committee has referred to the 
MAGNIMS consensus guidelines on the use of MRI in 
MS for establishing disease prognosis and monitoring 
patients to generate recommendations for this review 
question.
Recommendations
R10. Consider combining MRI with clinical measures 
when evaluating disease evolution in treated 
patients.
(weak)
R11. When monitoring treatment response in patients 
treated with DMDs, perform a standardized reference 
brain MRI usually within 6 months of treatment onset 
and compare it with a further brain MRI performed 
typically 12 months after starting treatment. Adjust 
the timing of both MRIs, taking into account the fol-
lowing aspects:
•
•
the drug’s mechanism of action (particularly the 
speed of action);
•
•
disease activity (including clinical and MRI 
measures).
(consensus statement)
R12. When monitoring treatment response in patients 
treated with DMDs, the measurement of new or une-
quivocally enlarging T2 lesions is the preferred MRI 
method supplemented by GAD-enhancing lesions for 
monitoring treatment response. Evaluation of these 
parameters requires the following:
•
•
high-quality, standardized MRI scans;
•
•
interpretation by highly qualified readers with 
experience in MS.
(consensus statement)
R13. When monitoring treatment safety in patients 
treated with DMDs, perform a standardized reference 
brain MRI:
every year in low-risk progressive multifocal leu-
koencephalopathy (PML) patients;
•
•
more frequent MRIs (on a 3–6 monthly basis) in 
high-risk PML patients (John Cunningham virus 
(JCV) positive, natalizumab treatment duration 
over 18 months);
•
•
in patients with high risk of PML who switch 
drugs at the time that the current treatment is; 
discontinued and after the new treatment is 
started.
(consensus statement)
Treatment strategy if inadequate treatment 
response
Review question 6. In patients with relapsing MS 
treated with interferon or glatiramer acetate and evi-
dence of early disease activity (relapses and/or disa-
bility progression and/or MRI activity at 6/12 months), 
what is the benefit of switching between interferon

and glatiramer acetate versus moving to more effica-
cious drugs?
For review questions 6–8, the electronic database 
search identified 3856 records. Of these, 3853 studies 
were excluded based on their title/abstract and 82 
studies were subjected to a full-text appraisal. After a 
full-text review and removal of duplicates, 9 studies 
met the eligibility criteria for this review. Due to dif-
ferences in study design and included populations, the 
results could not be meta-analysed and are reported 
narratively. Three of the studies were RCTs;85,112,113 
five were retrospective cohorts;114–118 and one was a 
prospective cohort.119 Before switching drugs, all par-
ticipants had been receiving interferon beta-1a, inter-
feron beta-1b or glatiramer acetate and were described 
as having had a treatment failure, although this term 
was not always defined 115,117 or was assessed subjec-
tively by the neurologist.118 Two studies included spe-
cific treatment failure definitions combining relapses 
(more than one or more than two) and sustained disa-
bility worsening (defined as increase in at least 0.5 
points or increase in at least 1 point in the EDSS score 
compared with the year prior to therapy).114,119 In four 
studies, participants who switched drugs received fin-
golimod;112–116 in two studies, participants switched to 
natalizumab;118,119 in one study, participants switched 
to natalizumab;117 and in one trial, participants 
switched to alemtuzumab.85 Further study character-
istics are presented in Supplementary Appendix 4 – 
Tables 37 and 38.
All analysed studies were consistent in showing a 
benefit in switching to alemtuzumab, fingolimod or 
natalizumab compared with interferon or glatiramer 
acetate, depending on specific study comparators. 
Switching to alemtuzumab resulted in better out-
comes in terms of relapses, with a lower annualized 
relapse rate (0.26 vs 0.52; p = 0.0002) and a higher 
proportion of participants free from relapse (66% vs 
47%; p < 0.0001). Switching to alemtuzumab also 
resulted in a lower proportion of participants with dis-
ability worsening (13% vs 20%; p = 0.02) and fewer 
participants with new or newly enlarging T2 lesions 
(46% vs 68%; p < 0.00001) at 2 years after the switch, 
according to evidence with a moderate risk of bias.85 
Moreover, a larger proportion of participants in the 
interferon group dropped out of the study due to any 
reason (8% vs 32%; p < 0.00001) and due to side 
effects (3% vs 7%, p = 0.02).
Switching to fingolimod resulted in a 61% reduction 
in the annualized relapse rate, a 46%–48% reduction 
in GAD lesion count and a 21%–27% reduction in 
new or newly enlarged T2 lesions at 52 weeks in a 
study with a low risk of bias.112 Further evidence with 
a serious risk of bias reported a longer time to relapse 
(360 vs 274 median days; p = 0.006) and a lower 
annualized relapse rate (0.19 vs 0.51; p = 0.0013) in 
the group that switched to fingolimod at 51 weeks.114 
Finally, evidence from two studies with a moderate 
risk of bias showed consistent findings, with a greater 
time to relapse, a lower annualized relapse rate and a 
greater time to EDSS progression at 2 years after the 
switch.115,116 All these studies reported consistent 
results of a higher proportion of participants discon-
tinuing the study due to any reason in the interferon/
glatiramer acetate group than in the fingolimod 
group.113–116
Switching to natalizumab resulted in a longer time to 
relapse and to disability worsening (HR = 0.42, 95% 
CI: 0.24–0.71; HR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.20–0.71) at 
2 years’ post-switch, according to evidence with a 
serious risk of bias.119 The impact on annualized 
relapse rate, which held at 2, 3 and 4 years, was con-
firmed by a later study with a moderate risk of bias 
(annualized relapse rate of 0.20 vs 0.58), but there 
was a disproportionately higher drop-out rate in the 
natalizumab group, which warrants caution when 
interpreting findings.118 Other studies with a serious 
risk of bias could not confirm the positive results on 
the annualized relapse rate 117 or on time to disability 
worsening.118 These studies reported little difference 
in the proportion of participants discontinuing due to 
adverse events (7% vs 5.8%)119 or a longer time to 
treatment discontinuation in the natalizumab group 
(HR = 0.40, 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.47).118
Quality assessment. Evidence obtained by RCTs was 
assessed for risk of bias using the ‘Cochrane Risk of 
Bias tool’. There was a low risk of bias for sequence 
generation, allocation concealment, attrition and 
selective outcome reporting for all included trials. In 
two of the trials, there was a high risk of performance 
and detection bias since all patients, providers and 
assessors were aware of treatment allocation,85,113 
whereas in the third trial,112 the risk of bias was low 
since all participants, providers and assessors were 
blinded to treatment allocation. See Supplementary 
Appendix 4 – Table 37 for further details on the qual-
ity assessment.
The cohort studies were assessed using the Cochrane 
tool for ‘ROBINS-I’, three were judged as having a 
moderate risk of bias 115,116,118 and three as having a 
serious risk of bias.114,117,119 The domain that most 
commonly had a high risk of bias was in the measure-
ment of outcomes, as outcome assessors were not 
blinded to participant treatment. In two studies,114,117 
 Multiple Sclerosis Journal 24(2)
108 
journals.sagepub.com/home/msj
the authors did not report all outcomes specified in the 
paper and were therefore at a high risk of bias for 
selective outcome reporting. Five out of the six cohort 
studies 114–116,118,119 used propensity score matching to 
account for potential confounders, and one of them119 
reported differences at baseline between participants 
who switched to a second-line drug and those who 
switched to a different first-line drug. See 
Supplementary Appendix 4 – Table 38 for further 
details on the quality assessment.
Recommendations
R14. Offer a more efficacious drug to patients treated 
with interferon or glatiramer acetate who show evi-
dence of disease activity assessed as recommended in 
questions 4–5 of this guideline.
(strong)
R15. When deciding on which drug to switch to, in 
consultation with the patient, consider the following 
factors:
•
•
Patient characteristics and comorbidities;
•
•
Drug safety profile;
•
•
Disease severity/activity.
(consensus statement)
Treatment strategies in case of safety issues
Review question 7. In patients with relapsing MS who 
stop taking a highly efficacious drug, is there a risk of 
return and/or rebound of their disease activity 
(increased risk of relapses, disability progression and/
or MRI activity)?
For review questions 6–8, the electronic database 
search identified 3853 records. Of these, 3771 studies 
were excluded based on their title/abstract and 82 
studies were subjected to a full-text appraisal. After a 
full-text review and removal of duplicates, 19 studies 
met the eligibility criteria for this review. One study 
was an RCT;120 12 were prospective cohort stud-
ies;121–132 and six were retrospective cohorts.133–136 In 
15 studies, participants were receiving natalizumab 
before discontinuing treatment due to safety issues, 
whereas in one study,127 participants were receiving 
fingolimod. The number of included participants 
ranged from 18 to 333 (mean: 83). Treatment strate-
gies after discontinuation of the drug varied and 
mainly included the following: no treatment, corticos-
teroids, interferon/glatiramer acetate and fingolimod. 
There was also great variation in the length of wash-
out, which ranged from 1 to 6 months. The mean/
median number of natalizumab doses received prior 
to the switch ranged from 19 to 41. Further study 
characteristics are presented in Supplementary 
Appendix 4 – Table 39.
Rebound. Rebound was generally described as a 
return of disease activity beyond that seen in the pre-
treatment period; however, there were differences in 
definitions across the included studies, ranging from 
the general ‘change in the disease course with wors-
ening of the disease activity beyond the pre-treatment 
levels’ to the more specific ‘increase in disease activ-
ity following natalizumab interruption defined as at 
least four T1 GAD lesions more than in pre-natali-
zumab scans’. Across 11 studies, 2 reported no evi-
dence of rebound123,135 and 1 reported no evidence of 
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.128 
The proportion of participants showing evidence of 
rebound ranged, in most of the studies, from 9% to 
12%,126,127,131,132,137 whereas other authors reported 
higher rebounds, including 14%,136 21.2%134 and 
38.3%.138
Relapse outcomes. At 24 weeks after natalizumab 
cessation, there was a significant reduction in the 
annualized relapse rate between the pre-natalizumab 
period and the post-natalizumab period (2 vs 0.3; 
p = 0.009),128 and a reduction in the mean number of 
relapses (1.1 vs 0.07), although no p values were 
reported,120 according to fair quality evidence. At 
52 weeks after natalizumab discontinuation, several 
studies of fair to poor quality reported a statistically 
significant reduction in the annualized relapse rate 
compared with that during the pre-natalizumab period 
131,135,137,138 or described a reduction without statistical 
calculations.123,126 However, other studies of fair qual-
ity reported no change in the annualized relapse rate 
and mean number of relapses between the two time 
periods.120,134
Treatment after natalizumab varied across these stud-
ies. Patients treated with fingolimod approximately 
3 months after natalizumab cessation showed a sig-
nificantly reduced annualized relapse rate, whereas 
those who received no treatment showed a return to 
the same relapse rate observed in the pre-natalizumab 
period, according to fair quality evidence.133 The 
length of wash-out prior to switching to fingolimod 
was described to have an impact on the proportion of 
participants relapsing, with 19.9% in wash-out up to 
3 months, 31.1% for 3–6 months and 59.1% if wash-
out was longer than 6 months.124 In some stud-
ies,124,129,132,136 relapse was reported as a continuous 
outcome for the pre-natalizumab/fingolimod period 
and as a dichotomous outcome for the post-natali-
zumab/fingolimod period, so it was not possible to

make a direct comparison between the two time 
periods.
MRI outcomes. Only 6 studies reported MRI out-
comes in the pre-natalizumab and post-natalizumab 
period,121,123,126,128,131,138 and the results were less con-
sistent than those for relapses. The presence of any 
new or enlarging T2-weighted lesion or any GAD 
lesion at 52 weeks after discontinuation was described 
in 48% of participants who had interrupted natali-
zumab, compared with 54% in the pre-natalizumab 
period.123 Similarly, a small study (n = 23) reported a 
reduction in the proportion of participants who had an 
active MRI scan in the post-natalizumab period (30%) 
at 15 weeks compared with that during the pre-natali-
zumab period (70%).121 Various studies reported an 
increase in the mean number of GAD lesions in all 
participants as a group during the pre-natalizumab 
period compared to that during the post-natalizumab 
period.126,128,131,138
Quality assessment. The study quality was assessed 
with the ‘Quality Assessment of Before-After (Pre-
Post) Studies With No Control Group’ tool developed 
by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and 
the Research Triangle Institute International. One 
study123 was rated ‘good’; 11 were rated ‘fair’, indi-
cating some susceptibility to bias;120,121,124,126,128,129,131, 
134,135,137,138 and four were rated ‘poor’, indicating a 
significant risk of bias.127,132,133,136 The main reasons 
for the ‘fair’ and ‘poor’ ratings were a lack of outcome 
assessor blinding, a lack of definition of outcomes, no 
power calculations and no statistical analyses for the 
pre- and post- drug periods. See Supplementary 
Appendix 4 – Table 39 for further details on the qual-
ity assessment.
Review question 8. In patients with relapsing MS who 
stop taking a highly efficacious drug, what is the ben-
efit of further treatment?
For review questions 6–8, the electronic database 
search identified 3853 records. Of these, 3771 studies 
were excluded based on their title/abstract and 82 
studies were subjected to a full-text appraisal. After a 
full-text review and removal of duplicates, four stud-
ies met the eligibility criteria; three were prospective 
cohorts;131,139,140 one was an RCT141 and participants 
in all the studies were receiving natalizumab before 
switching to other DMTs. The number of included 
participants ranged from 110 to 214 (mean: 166), and 
the length of the follow-up post-switch ranged from 
28 to 52 weeks (mean: 44 weeks). Due to differences 
in study design and treatment groups post-switch, it 
was not possible to meta-analyse the data, and the 
results are reported narratively. Further details on the 
study characteristics are presented in Supplementary 
Appendix 4 – Table 40.
Evidence from a single RCT with a high risk of bias 
indicated that fewer participants who stayed on natali-
zumab had relapses (4%) as compared to those who 
switched to placebo (17%) or to other therapies (20%) 
(interferon, glatiramer acetate and methylpredniso-
lone) at 24 weeks’ post-switch. Similarly, in the natal-
izumab group, no participants had disease recurrence 
(one new GAD lesion of >0.8 cm3 or 2 or more GAD 
lesions of any size), compared with 46% in the pla-
cebo group and 37% in the other therapies group.141 
Evidence from an observational study with a moder-
ate risk of bias compared patients switching from 
natalizumab to fingolimod or to interferon/glatiramer 
acetate. The results showed a reduced risk of relapse 
(IRR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37–0.74) and a lower propor-
tion of patients showing disability worsening (11.4% 
vs 22.5%) in the fingolimod group at 1 year post-
switch, with no significant difference between groups 
in the time to disability worsening (HR = 0.58, 95% 
CI, 0.26 to 1.31).140 Additional evidence with a seri-
ous risk of bias indicated no significant difference 
between switching to fingolimod or to interferon/
glatiramer acetate in the number of participants who 
were free from relapse.131 Finally, switching from 
natalizumab to rituximab resulted in a reduced risk of 
relapse compared to that associated with switching to 
fingolimod (1.8% vs 17.6%; HR = 0.10, 95% CI: 
0.02–0.43) and a lower proportion of participants 
with contrast-enhancing lesions (1.4% vs 24.2%; 
OR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.0–0.22), according to evidence 
with a moderate risk of bias.139
Quality assessment. According to the Cochrane tool 
for ‘ROBINS-I’, two of the observational studies139,140 
were judged as having a moderate risk of bias, and the 
third one131 was judged as having a serious risk of 
bias. All three observational cohort studies had a high 
risk of bias for outcome measurements, as outcome 
assessors were not blinded to participant treatment. 
There was no clear evidence of selection bias, and it 
was unclear how many participants dropped out of the 
studies. Only Alping et al.139 and Iaffaldano et al.140 
used propensity score matching to account for poten-
tial confounders. The RCT141 was judged as having a 
high risk of bias. There was a high risk of performance 
and detection bias since all patients, providers and 
assessors were aware of treatment allocation. There 
was an unclear risk of bias for missing outcome data, 
as the authors reported study drop-out only for 
52 weeks’ follow-up, and outcomes were reported 
only at 24 weeks. There was a low risk of bias for

sequence generation and allocation concealment. See 
Supplementary Appendix 4 – Table 40 for further 
details on the quality assessment.
Recommendations
R16. When treatment with a highly efficacious drug is 
stopped, either due to inefficacy or safety concerns, 
consider starting another highly efficacious drug. 
When starting the new drug, take into account the fol-
lowing factors:
•
•
disease activity (clinical and MRI), the greater 
the activity, the higher the urgency to start new 
treatment;
•
•
half life and biological activity of the previous 
drug;
•
•
the potential for resumed disease activity or 
even rebound (particularly with natalizumab).
(consensus statement)
R17. In treatment decisions, consider the possibility 
of resumed disease activity or even rebound when 
stopping treatment, particularly with natalizumab.
(weak)
Long-term treatment
Review question 9. In patients with relapsing MS 
treated with a DMD that remain stable over a long 
time period, what is the benefit of continuing treat-
ment compared to stopping?
The electronic database search for this question iden-
tified 3066 records. After removal of duplicates, 
3014 studies were excluded based on their title/
abstract. After a full-text review, one study was 
excluded, and only one prospective cohort study met 
the eligibility criteria.142 It included patients treated 
with interferon or glatiramer acetate for at least 
3 years without relapses for at least 5 years and com-
pared those patients who stopped versus those who 
continued treatment using propensity score match-
ing. At the study baseline, the mean age was 44 years, 
and the mean EDSS score was 3.5. The reason for 
treatment discontinuation was recorded only in 40% 
of the group (26.2% medication intolerance, 23.8% 
lack of improvement, 13% adverse event and 11% 
disease progression). There was little difference 
between the groups in the proportion of participants 
who relapsed (36% vs 37.8%) and in the time to 
relapse (HR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.84–1.37; p = 0.584), 
according to evidence with a moderate risk of bias. 
There was a longer time to disability progression in 
the group of participants who continued treatment 
than in those who discontinued (HR = 1.47, 95% CI: 
1.18–1.84; p = 0.001).142
Quality assessment. According to the Cochrane tool 
for ‘ROBINS-I’, the study was judged to have a mod-
erate risk of bias overall. This was due to an unclear 
risk of attrition because the authors did not report 
whether any data were missing. There was a moderate 
risk of detection bias as it was not possible to blind 
treatment discontinuation.
Recommendations
R18. Consider continuing a DMD if a patient is stable 
(clinically and on MRI) and shows no safety or toler-
ability issues.
(weak)
Treatment in special situations: pregnancy
Review question 10. In women with MS treated with 
DMDs who wish to start a pregnancy or who have an 
unplanned pregnancy, what should be the therapeutic 
approach?
For this question, an existing SR143 was used to locate 
studies published prior to 2012, and eight studies met 
the eligibility criteria. These studies were supple-
mented by an electronic database search, which iden-
tified 808 records published between January 2012 
and December 2016, and of these, 787 studies were 
excluded based on their title/abstract and 21 studies 
were subjected to a full-text appraisal. After a full-text 
review and removal of duplicates, 14 studies met the 
eligibility criteria for this review, resulting in a total 
of 19 available studies. Due to differences in study 
design and included populations, it was not possible 
to meta-analyse any data, and the results are reported 
narratively. Further study characteristics are presented 
in Supplementary Appendix 4 – Table 41.
Several studies investigated the impact of exposure to 
interferon beta and/or glatiramer acetate,144–158 while 
fewer and more recent ones explored the effect of 
natalizumab,159–161 dimethyl fumarate,162 terifluno-
mide 163 and fingolimod.164 In most studies, women 
were classified as being exposed to a DMT, provided 
the last dose/injection of drug was administered after 
the last menstrual period before conception. 
Participants were recruited through patient registries, 
MS centres and clinical trials and from pharmaceuti-
cal companies’ global pharmacovigilance databases. 
The number of included pregnancies ranged from 35 
to 445 (mean: 206).
Exposure to interferon and/or glatiramer ace-
tate. Regarding exposure to interferon, a study with a 
moderate risk of bias indicated no significant differ-
ence between groups (exposed vs non-exposed) in the

proportion of infants born with low birth weight 
(OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.41–3.15, p = 0.803).165 This 
was confirmed in two additional studies with a seri-
ous risk of bias.145,155 For spontaneous abortion, evi-
dence with a serious risk of bias due to low numbers 
indicated a higher proportion of women with sponta-
neous abortion in the exposed group.144,145,155,165 The 
proportion of infants with congenital malformations 
was higher in the exposed group (9% vs 5%)145 but 
was not confirmed in a later study showing a higher 
risk in the unexposed group (3.1% vs 5.5%).165 These 
comparisons were based on a small number of partici-
pants and should be interpreted with caution. For glat-
iramer acetate, evidence with a moderate risk of bias 
(n = 246) indicated a higher number of spontaneous 
abortions in the exposed group than in the unexposed 
group (8.6% vs 6.3%); however, congenital malfor-
mations were reported to be higher in the unexposed 
group (6.7% vs 2.2%).153 Seven additional studies 
included women who were exposed to interferon or 
glatiramer acetate; in three of these studies, the expo-
sure groups were combined,143,147,149 whereas in four 
they were separated, resulting in three armed stud-
ies.150–152,158 There are inconsistent findings between 
the different studies regarding low birth weight, spon-
taneous abortion and congenital malformations. Fur-
ther details of the study results are presented in 
Supplementary Appendix 9 - Table 4.
Exposure to natalizumab. One study with a serious 
risk of bias compared exposure to natalizumab with 
interferon or glatiramer acetate and suggested little 
difference between the groups in the proportion of 
infants born with low birth weight but a higher risk of 
spontaneous abortion in the group exposed to inter-
feron or glatiramer acetate (21.1% vs 17.4%) and a 
higher proportion of infants with congenital malfor-
mations in the group exposed to natalizumab (3.9% vs 
1.4%).159 Compared to women who were not exposed 
to DMDs, evidence with a serious risk of bias indi-
cated a higher proportion of women experiencing a 
spontaneous abortion in those exposed to natalizumab 
but a higher proportion of infants born with a con-
genital malformation in the unexposed group.161 Fur-
ther details of the study results are presented in 
Supplementary Appendix 9 – Table 4.
Exposure to other disease-modifying treatments. 
 
Three studies with a serious risk of bias compared 
pregnancy outcomes in women who had unplanned 
conceptions while receiving dimethyl fumarate,162 fin-
golimod164 and teriflunomide163 during clinical trials 
with those who had received placebo. In both the fin-
golimod and teriflunomide studies,163,164 the placebo 
groups could not be considered, as there were very 
few participants. Among the women receiving fingo-
limod, 24% experienced a spontaneous abortion, and 
5% of live births resulted in infants with a congenital 
malformation. For the women exposed to terifluno-
mide, 18.8% had a spontaneous abortion, and out of 
27 live births, there were no malformations. The only 
study with a control group suggested a higher propor-
tion of pregnancies resulting in spontaneous abortion 
in the placebo group (15.4%) than in the dimethyl 
fumarate-exposed group (7.7%).162 Further details of 
study results are presented Supplementary Appendix 
9 – Table 4.
Quality assessment. According to the Cochrane tool 
for ‘ROBINS-I’, all cohort studies that included an 
exposed and unexposed group, except four,153,154,158,165 
were judged as having a serious risk of bias. Con-
founding and outcome measurement were the domains 
that most commonly had a high risk of bias, as out-
come assessors may have been aware of participants’ 
exposure to DMTs. The risk of selective outcome 
reporting could not be assessed because no study pro-
tocols were available. The classification of partici-
pants as exposed or unexposed was not a problem in 
several studies149,150,153–155,158,159,161–165 as exposed sta-
tus was clearly defined and classification was unlikely 
to have been affected by knowledge of the outcomes 
as they were measured prospectively. However, in 
some studies, information used to define DMT expo-
sure was recorded retrospectively after delivery; 
therefore, infant outcomes may have biased recall of 
prior exposure. This issue resulted in a serious risk of 
bias144,147,151,155 or a moderate risk of bias145,152 in this 
domain. For the five cohort studies that included only 
an exposed group, three were rated as moderate qual-
ity146,148,160 and two as poor quality156,157 according to 
the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Before-After 
(Pre-Post) Studies With No Control Group.
Recommendations
R19. Advise all women of childbearing potential that 
DMDs are not licensed during pregnancy, except glat-
iramer acetate 20 mg/mL.
(consensus statement)
R20. For women planning a pregnancy, if there is a high 
risk of disease reactivation, consider using interferon or 
glatiramer acetate until pregnancy is confirmed. In 
some very specific (active) cases, continuing this treat-
ment during pregnancy could also be considered.
(weak)
R21. For women with persistent high disease activity, 
it would generally be advised to delay pregnancy. For 
those who, despite this advice, still decide to become 
pregnant or have an unplanned pregnancy:

•
treatment with natalizumab throughout preg-
nancy may be considered after full discussion of 
potential implications.

•
treatment with alemtuzumab could be an alter-
native therapeutic option for planned pregnancy 
in very active cases, provided that a 4-month 
interval is strictly observed from the latest infu-
sion until conception.
