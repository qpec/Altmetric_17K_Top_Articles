To promote optimal health and well-being, adults aged 
18–60 years are recommended to sleep at least 7 hours each night 
(1). Sleeping <7 hours per night is associated with increased risk 
for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, 
stroke, frequent mental distress, and all-cause mortality (2–4). 
Insufficient sleep impairs cognitive performance, which can 
increase the likelihood of motor vehicle and other transportation 
accidents, industrial accidents, medical errors, and loss of work 
productivity that could affect the wider community (5). CDC 
analyzed data from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System (BRFSS) to determine the prevalence of a healthy sleep 
duration (≥7 hours) among 444,306 adult respondents in all 
50 states and the District of Columbia. A total of 65.2% of 
respondents reported a healthy sleep duration; the age-adjusted 
prevalence of healthy sleep was lower among non-Hispanic blacks, 
American Indians/Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians/Pacific 
Islanders, and multiracial respondents, compared with non-
Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and Asians. State-based estimates of 
healthy sleep duration prevalence ranged from 56.1% in Hawaii 
to 71.6% in South Dakota. Geographic clustering of the lowest 
prevalence of healthy sleep duration was observed in the southeast-
ern United States and in states along the Appalachian Mountains, 
and the highest prevalence was observed in the Great Plains states. 
More than one third of U.S. respondents reported typically sleep-
ing <7 hours in a 24-hour period, suggesting an ongoing need for 
public awareness and public education about sleep health; worksite 
shift policies that ensure healthy sleep duration for shift workers, 
particularly medical professionals, emergency response personnel, 
and transportation industry personnel; and opportunities for 
health care providers to discuss the importance of healthy sleep 
duration with patients and address reasons for poor sleep health.
BRFSS* is a state-based, random-digit–dialed telephone survey 
of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged ≥18 years. BRFSS 
is conducted collaboratively by state health departments and CDC 
(6) among both landline and cell phone respondents, and data are 
weighted to state population estimates. Response rates for BRFSS 
are calculated using standards set by the American Association 
of Public Opinion Research Response Rate Formula #4.† The 
response rate is defined as the number of respondents who com-
pleted the survey as a proportion of all eligible and likely eligible 
persons. The median response rate for all states and territories in 
2014 was 47.0% and ranged from 25.1% to 60.1%.
Survey respondents in 2014 were asked, “On average, how 
many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period?” Hours of

sleep were recorded in whole numbers by rounding 30 minutes 
or more up to the next whole hour and dropping 29 or fewer 
minutes. The age-adjusted prevalence and 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of the recommended healthy sleep duration 
(≥7 hours) was calculated by state and selected characteristics, 
and adjusted to the 2000 projected U.S. population aged 
≥18 years. For comparisons of prevalence between subgroups, 
statistical significance (p<0.05) was determined by t-tests. All 
indicated differences between subgroups are statistically signifi-
cant. Statistical software programs that account for the complex 
sampling design of the BRFSS were used for the analysis.
Among 444,306 respondents, 11.8% reported a sleep duration 
≤5 hours, 23.0% reported 6 hours, 29.5% reported 7 hours, 27.7% 
reported 8 hours, 4.4% reported 9 hours, and 3.6% reported 
≥10 hours. Overall, 65.2% reported the recommended healthy 
sleep duration (age-adjusted prevalence = 64.9%) (Table 1). The 
age-specific prevalence of sleeping ≥7 hours was highest among 
respondents aged ≥65 years (73.7%) compared with other age 
groups. The age-adjusted prevalence of healthy sleep duration was 
lower among Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (53.7%), non-
Hispanic blacks (54.2%), multiracial non-Hispanics (53.6%), 
and American Indians/Alaska Natives (59.6%) compared with 
non-Hispanic whites (66.8%), Hispanics (65.5%), and Asians 
(62.5%). Respondents who indicated they were unable to work 
or unemployed had lower age-adjusted healthy sleep duration 
prevalences (51.0% and 60.2%, respectively) than did employed 
respondents (64.9%). The prevalence of healthy sleep duration 
was highest among respondents with a college degree or higher 
(71.5%). The prevalence was higher among married respondents 
(67.4%) compared with those who were divorced, widowed, or 
separated (55.7%), or never married (62.3%).
Prevalence of healthy sleep duration varied among states 
and ranged from 56.1% in Hawaii to 71.6% in South Dakota 
(Table 2). Most of the Great Plains states were in the upper 
quintile for healthy sleep duration; states in the southeastern 
United States and along the Appalachian Mountains tended 
to be in the lower quintiles (Figure).
Discussion
This is the first published report to document state-based 
estimates of self-reported healthy sleep duration for all 50 
states and the District of Columbia. On average, 65.2% of 
adult respondents reported a healthy sleep duration. The 
geographic distribution pattern of low healthy sleep duration 
prevalence is consistent with 2008 state prevalence patterns of 
perceived insufficient rest or sleep among U.S. adults (7). The 
lower healthy sleep duration prevalence in the BRFSS among 
non-Hispanic black adults relative to non-Hispanic whites is 
consistent with a previous nationwide 2007–2010 comparison 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) (8). The results also suggest that employment 
and higher education might be determinants of healthy sleep.
A lower prevalence of healthy sleep duration was observed in 
the southeastern United States and in states along the Appalachian 
Mountains. This distribution is similar to geographic variations in 
prevalence estimates for obesity (9) and diabetes (9) and death rates

from heart disease§ and stroke.¶ Short sleep duration (<7 hours per 
night) and other indicators of poor sleep health are associated with 
greater insulin resistance, metabolic abnormalities, and weight gain 
(5), which might then result in diabetes and adverse cardiovascular 
outcomes. A sleep duration of ≥7 hours is associated with lower 
prevalence estimates of cigarette smoking, leisure-time physical 
inactivity, and obesity compared with a short sleep duration.** 
Although unhealthy adults with chronic conditions might sleep 
longer (2,3), little empirical evidence exists to indicate that long 
sleep duration (≥9 hour per night) causes adverse conditions among 
healthy adults exists (1).

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, sleep duration was obtained by self-report and was 
not corroborated by actigraphy (sensor-measurement of motor 
activity), polysomnography (sleep study), other objective mea-
sures, or sleep journals. The overall estimate of 65.2% in the 
2014 BRFSS adult population is slightly higher than the popula-
tion estimate of 60.1% from the 2007–2008 NHANES (2) and 
slightly lower than the prevalence of 71.6% reported from the 
2008–2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).†† Some 
variation might be a result of the different wording used by the 
different surveys. Although BRFSS and NHIS both asked about 
typical sleep duration in a 24-hour period, NHANES asked 
how much sleep respondents typically get “at night on weekdays 
or workdays.” Finally, institutionalized respondents were not 
assessed in the present investigation, NHANES, or NHIS; if 
institutionalized persons are more likely to have shorter sleep 
durations because of chronic physical or mental conditions, then 
the prevalence of ≥7 hours might be overestimated in the BRFSS 
population. However, the relationships of healthy sleep with 
sociodemographic characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes are 
consistent with the other studies despite variations in definitions 
of healthy or optimal sleep.
Based on recent recommendations for healthy sleep duration 
(1), these findings suggest that, although almost two thirds of 
U.S. adults sleep ≥7 hours in a 24-hour period, an estimated 
83.6 million U.S. adults sleep <7 hours. Therefore, clinicians 
might find routine discussion of sleep health with their patients as 
well as pursuit of explanations for poor sleep health an important 
component of providing health care. Healthy sleep duration in 
adults can be promoted by sleep health education and behavior 
changes, such as setting a pattern of going to bed at the same time 
each night and rising at the same time each morning; making 
sure that the bedroom environment is quiet, dark, relaxing, and 
neither too hot nor too cold; turning off or removing televisions, 
computers, mobile devices, and distracting or light-emitting 
electronic devices from the bedroom; and avoiding large meals, 
nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine before bedtime.§§ Insomnia 
symptoms, such as trouble falling or staying asleep can usually be 
resolved with improved sleep habits or psychological or behavioral 
therapies (10). At present, no professional sleep organizations 
have issued consensus statements or recommendations about the 
efficacy or safety of either over-the-counter or prescription sleep 
aids for improving sleep duration in the general adult population. 
In addition, strategies to reduce risks associated with shift work 
and long work hours include designing better work schedules.§§ 
Evaluation and monitoring of sleep might also be an important 
function of health care professionals, including sleep specialists 
(5). Keeping a 10-day sleep journal or diary about sleep times, 
napping, and behaviors that affect sleep, such as exercise, alcohol 
use, and caffeine consumption, might be helpful before discussing 
sleep problems with a physician.¶¶

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Short sleep duration (<7 hours per night) is associated with greater 
likelihoods of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, coronary 
heart disease, stroke, frequent mental distress, and death.
What is added by this report?
The first state-specific estimates of the prevalence of a ≥7 hour 
sleep duration in a 24-hour period show geographic clustering of 
lower prevalence estimates for this duration of sleep in the 
southeastern United States and in states along the Appalachian 
Mountains, which are regions with the highest burdens of obesity 
and other chronic conditions. Non-Hispanic black, American 
Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and 
multiracial populations report a lower prevalence of ≥7 hours 
sleep compared with the rest of the U.S. adult population.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The determination that more than a third of U.S. adults report 
sleeping <7 hours and findings of geographic and sociodemo-
graphic variations in low prevalence of healthy sleep duration 
suggest opportunities for promoting sleep health. These 
opportunities include sleep health education, reducing racial/
ethnic and economic disparities, changes in work shift policies, 
and routine medical assessment of patients’ sleep concerns in 
health care systems.
