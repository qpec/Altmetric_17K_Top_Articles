Abstract
Problem/Condition: In the United States, marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug. In 2013, 7.5% (19.8 million) of 
the U.S. population aged ≥12 years reported using marijuana during the preceding month. Because of certain state-level policies 
that have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use, population-based data on marijuana use and other related indicators 
are needed to help monitor behavioral health changes in the United States.
Period Covered: 2002–2014.
Description of System: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is a national- and state-level survey of a representative 
sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged ≥12 years. NSDUH collects information about the use of illicit 
drugs, alcohol, and tobacco; initiation of substance use; frequency of substance use; substance dependence and abuse; perception 
of substance harm risk or no risk; and other related behavioral health indicators. This report describes national trends for selected 
marijuana use and related indicators, including prevalence of marijuana use; initiation; perception of harm risk, approval, and attitudes; 
perception of availability and mode of acquisition; dependence and abuse; and perception of legal penalty for marijuana possession.
Results: In 2014, a total of 2.5 million persons aged ≥12 years had used marijuana for the first time during the preceding 
12 months, an average of approximately 7,000 new users each day. During 2002–2014, the prevalence of marijuana use during the 
past month, past year, and daily or almost daily increased among persons aged ≥18 years, but not among those aged 12–17 years. 
Among persons aged ≥12 years, the prevalence of perceived great risk from smoking marijuana once or twice a week and once a 
month decreased and the prevalence of perceived no risk increased. The prevalence of past year marijuana dependence and abuse 
decreased, except among persons aged ≥26 years. Among persons aged ≥12 years, the percentage reporting that marijuana was 
fairly easy or very easy to obtain increased. The percentage of persons aged ≥12 reporting the mode of acquisition of marijuana 
was buying it and growing it increased versus getting it for free and sharing it. The percentage of persons aged ≥12 years reporting 
that the perceived maximum legal penalty for the possession of an ounce or less of marijuana in their state is a fine and no penalty 
increased versus probation, community service, possible prison sentence, and mandatory prison sentence.
Interpretation: Since 2002, marijuana use in the United States has increased among persons aged ≥18 years, but not among those 
aged 12–17 years. A decrease in the perception of great risk from smoking marijuana combined with increases in the perception of 
availability (i.e., fairly easy or very easy to obtain marijuana) and fewer punitive legal penalties (e.g., no penalty) for the possession 
of marijuana for personal use might play a role in increased use among adults.
Public Health Action: National- and state-level data can help federal, state, and local public health officials develop targeted prevention 
activities to reduce youth initiation of marijuana use, prevent marijuana dependence and abuse, and prevent adverse health effects. As 
state-level laws on medical and recreational marijuana use change, 
modifications might be needed to national- and state-level surveys 
and more timely and comprehensive surveillance systems might 
be necessary to provide these data. Marijuana use in younger 
age groups is a particular public health concern, and changing 
the perception of harm risk from smoking marijuana is needed.

Introduction
In the United States, marijuana (cannabis) is the most 
commonly used illicit drug (1). In 2013, data from the 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) indicated 
that approximately 2.4 million persons aged ≥12 years had used 
marijuana for the first time during the preceding 12 months, 
an average of approximately 6,600 new users each day (1). 
Among persons aged ≥12 years, approximately 8.1 million 
had used marijuana on 20 or more days during the preceding 
month (1), and approximately 4.2 million met the criteria 
for marijuana dependence and abuse* during the preceding 
year (1). Increased trends in substance use can coincide with 
decreased trends in perceived risk (1). According to NSDUH 
data, the prevalence of past month marijuana use among 
persons aged 12–17 years increased from 6.7% in 2006 to 
7.1% in 2013, and the percentage who perceived great risk 
from smoking marijuana once a month decreased from 34.6% 
in 2006 to 24.2% in 2013 (1).
The health effects associated with marijuana use are widely 
debated. However, regular use (i.e., daily or almost daily use) 
of marijuana or use during adolescence poses potential public 
health concerns, including reduced educational attainment, 
potential long-term health consequences, addiction in some 
users, increased risk for psychoses disorders, altered brain 
structure and function, and increased risk for injury from 
driving while under the influence (2–8).
Since 1971, NSDUH has been the principal national source 
of statistical information on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and 
tobacco. Several national- and state-level reports on substance 
use have been published by the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) using NSDUH data 
(9). To date, no comprehensive national report has focused only 
on a specific substance (e.g., marijuana). This report is the first 
to present an overview of national estimates for marijuana use 
and related indicators for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized 
population aged ≥12 years using 2002–2014 NSDUH data. 
Findings from this report can provide federal, state, and local 
public health officials with information about behavioral 
trends for marijuana use and related indicators. Public health 
officials can use these findings to develop and implement 
targeted prevention activities to reduce youth initiation and 
use of marijuana. Findings can also be used to assess the quality, 
relevance, and timeliness of surveillance capacity to effectively 
monitor trends of marijuana use.
Methods
Data Source and Collection
NSDUH collects information about the use of illicit drugs, 
alcohol, and tobacco among the U.S. noninstitutionalized 
civilian population aged ≥12 years (10). NSDUH respondents 
include residents of households and noninstitutional group 
quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories, migratory 
workers’ camps, and halfway houses) and civilians living on 
military bases. Homeless persons who do not use shelters, 
active duty military personnel, and residents of institutional 
group quarters (e.g., correctional facilities, nursing homes, 
mental institutions, and long-term hospitals) are excluded. 
NSDUH data are collected annually via household face-to-
face interviews using computer-assisted personal interviewing 
methods. An independent, multistage area probability sample 
design for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia 
allows for the production of state-level estimates. NSDUH 
oversamples youth (aged 12–17 years) and young adults (aged 
18–25 years) to allow increased precision in those age groups. 
Additional information about sample design can be found 
elsewhere (11,12).
NSDUH is planned and managed by the Center for 
Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) at 
SAMHSA. Data are collected and processed by RTI 
International (Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) 
through a contract with CBHSQ. The data presented in this 
report are limited to the years 2002–2014 using NSDUH’s 
restricted files. Data are protected under the Confidential 
Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 
2002 (PL 107-347), which ensures that all NSDUH data 
are used for statistical purposes only and cannot be used for 
any other purposes.  NSDUH was reviewed and approved 
by RTI International’s Institutional Review Board (protocol 
ID no. 13961, project no. 0213986). NSDUH is authorized 
by Section 505 of the Public Health Service Act (available 
at https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-
title42/pdf/USCODE-2010-title42-chap6A-subchapIII-
A-partA-sec290aa-4.pdf ). More information about 
confidentiality and Office of Management and Budget 
approval is available at http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/
PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=200106-0930-004. Changes to the 
NSDUH survey design and methodology occurred in 1999 
and 2002; therefore, survey data collected before 2002 
are not comparable to those collected during 2002–2014. 
These changes included a transition from paper-and-
pencil interviewing to computer-assisted interviewing, 
improvements to data collection quality control procedures, 
* Substance use disorder (also known as dependence or abuse) is defined as 
meeting criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994) for either 
dependence or abuse.

and the addition of a $30 monetary incentive. During 
2002–2014, the only change implemented involved the use 
of census data to produce the sample weights. In 2002, the 
2000 decennial census data were introduced and used in the 
2002–2010 sample weights and in 2011, the 2010 census 
data were introduced and used in the 2011–2014 sample 
weights. However, those weight changes were not substantial 
enough to cause a break in comparability with earlier years. 
Detailed information regarding the NSDUH methodology 
and questionnaire is available elsewhere (9–12).
Sample Design
During 2002–2013, states with the largest population 
were designated as large sample states (California, Florida, 
Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and 
Texas); these eight states had an annual target sample size 
of 3,600 participants per state. The remaining 42 states and 
the District of Columbia had an annual target sample size of 
900 participants per state. Beginning in 2014, the sample was 
redesigned from a two-state sample size group (i.e., 3,600 and 
900) to a six-state sample size group (i.e., 4,560, 3,300, 2,400, 
1,500, 967, and 960) along with a change in the age-group 
allocation. This redesign means that the sample allocation 
is more proportional to the population size in each state 
(compared with the 2002–2013 sample design), which will 
result in generally increased precision of national estimates 
among various age groups (11,12). Additional details about 
the NSDUH 2014 redesign are available elsewhere (12).
Questionnaire
Marijuana use was defined in NSDUH as a self-report 
of using marijuana (pot or grass) or hashish (hash). All 
questions about marijuana in NSDUH were screened by 
answering positively to the following question: “Have you 
ever, even once, used marijuana or hashish?” For this report, 
national estimates were developed from six related indicators 
of marijuana use patterns and perceptions: 1) marijuana 
use; 2) marijuana initiation; 3) perception of harm risk, 
approval, and attitudes; 4) perception of availability and 
mode of acquisition; 5) marijuana dependence and abuse; and 
6) marijuana possession–criminal justice (Box). The detailed 
NSDUH questionnaire is available at http://www.samhsa.
gov/data/population-data-nsduh/reports?tab=39.
Variables
NSDUH data on marijuana use during the preceding 
month include the following demographic characteristics: 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, highest level of education completed, 
current employment status, and geographic area of residence 
(i.e., census region). Age was categorized into four groups: 
total (≥12 years), 12–17 years, 18–25 years, and ≥26 years. 
Sex was categorized into males and females. Race/ethnicity 
was categorized into seven groups: non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black or African America, non-Hispanic American 
Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Hawaiian/Other Pacific 
Islander, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic two or more 
races,† and Hispanic or Latino. Highest level of education 
completed was categorized into four groups: less than high 
school, high school, some college, and college graduate. 
Current employment status was categorized into four groups: 
full-time employment, part-time employment, unemployed, 
and other (e.g., student, keeping house or caring for children 
full-time, retired, or disabled). Geographic area of residence 
was divided into four regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, and 
West) as defined by the Census Bureau.§ This report presents 
national estimates of marijuana use and related indicators for all 
persons aged ≥12 years and three age subgroups (12–17 years, 
18–25 years, and ≥26 years).
Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SUDAAN 
version 11.0.1 (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, 
North Carolina). Prevalence measures, 95% confidence 
intervals, linear p-values, and relative prevalence differences 
for marijuana use and related indicators are presented in 
this report. Population weights were calibrated through a 
model-based procedure to state, age group, sex, and race/
ethnicity groupings, and variances were calculated accounting 
for the complex survey design. Thirteen years (2002–2014) 
of sample survey weights were used to produce national 
population estimates. Logistic regression analysis was used 
to examine linear temporal trends during 2002–2014. Each 
dichotomous indicator (e.g., marijuana use status: yes/no 
for each group) was separately regressed on year of survey to 
determine whether year could be a predictor of the likelihood 
of persons using marijuana over time. A level of α ≤0.05 was 
used to determine the statistical significance of the trends. The 
† Non-Hispanic two or more races category includes persons who reported more 
than one category (i.e., white, black or African American, American Indian/
Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Guamanian or Chamorro, Samoan, other 
Pacific Islander, Asian, or other).

relative prevalence difference (diff) was calculated between the 
2002 and 2014 national estimates, as an overall measure of the 
relative change in marijuana use or other related indicator over 
the period. A plus sign (+) indicates an increase in prevalence, 
a minus sign (-) indicates a decrease in prevalence, and no 
sign indicates no difference. National estimates presented 
in the report have met the criteria for statistical reliability. 
The criteria used to define unreliability of direct estimates 
from NSDUH are determined on the basis of the prevalence 
(proportion estimates), relative standard error (RSE, defined as 
the ratio of the standard error over the estimate), and sample 
size for each estimate. Estimates not meeting these criteria 
were suppressed and not included in the tables or figures, and 
suppressed estimates were not included in the statistical test 
analysis. Prevalence estimates were suppressed if any of the 
following occurred: 1) the prevalence estimate was <0.005% 
or >99.995%; 2) the RSE of the negative natural logarithm of 
the estimated proportion p (where p is the prevalence divided 
by 100) was >0.175 if the prevalence is ≤50%; 3) the RSE 
of the negative of the natural logarithm of (1-p) is >0.175 if 
the prevalence is >50%; 4) the actual sample size is <100; or

Marijuana use
• Past month use of marijuana (defined as those who reported 
use of marijuana within 30 days preceding the date of 
interview): “How long has it been since you last used 
marijuana or hashish?” (Answers were restricted to within 
the past 30 days.)
• Past year use of marijuana (defined as those who 
reported use of marijuana within 12 months preceding 
the date of interview, including those who reported use 
of marijuana within 30 days preceding the date of 
interview): “How long has it been since you last used 
marijuana or hashish?” (Answers were restricted to more 
than 30 days ago but within the past 12 months or 
within the past 30 days.)
• Daily or almost daily (frequency) marijuana use in the 
past year (defined as those having used marijuana on 300 
or more days in the past year): “On how many days in 
the past 12 months did you use marijuana or hashish?” 
and daily or almost daily (frequency) marijuana use in 
the past month (defined as those having used marijuana 
on 20 or more days in the past month): “During the past 
30 days, on how many days did you use marijuana or 
hashish?” (Indicator was also restricted to respondents 
who reported past year and past month marijuana use.)
Marijuana initiation
• Past year marijuana initiates (initiation) among persons at risk 
for initiation (defined as those having first used marijuana 
within the 12-month period before the date of the interview). 
Recent initiation is determined by a combination of the 
respondent’s age at the time of interview, their reported age, 
year and month of first use and imputed day of first use, and 
date of birth. This indicator also includes mean age of past 
year initiates of marijuana use.
Perception of harm risk, approval, and attitudes
• Perceived great risk and no risk from smoking marijuana 
(defined as those who reported that smoking marijuana 
once a month and once or twice a week might cause 
harm [great risk] and might not cause harm [no risk]): 
“How much do people risk harming themselves 
physically and in other ways when they smoke marijuana 
once a month?” and “How much do people risk harming 
themselves physically and in other ways when they 
smoke marijuana once or twice a week?” (Answers were 
restricted to great risk and no risk. 
• Perceived parental disapproval
 
– (Defined as those aged 12–17 years [youth] who 
reported perceived parental disapproval as strongly 
disapprove or somewhat disapprove of trying 
marijuana once or twice; indicator was also restricted 
to respondents aged 12–17 years who reported past 
month marijuana use): “How do you think your 
parents would feel about you trying marijuana or 
hashish once or twice?”

Results
Sample Size, Response Rates, and 
Population Estimates
During 2002–2014, NSDUH data were collected from 
884,742 completed individual respondent interviews (68,057 
annual average). Annual average weighted response rates for 
interviews were 74.8%, for an estimated total of 250,065,195 
persons of the U.S. population during the 2002–2014 
period. Person-level weights were determined on the basis 
of probabilities of selection, nonresponse adjustments, and 
poststratification to population estimates obtained from the 
Census Bureau. Table 1 displays the survey year distributions 
of sample size, weighted interview rates, and population 
estimates in NSDUH during 2002–2014.
Marijuana Use
Past Month Use
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of past month 
marijuana use among persons aged ≥12 years was 8.4%. From 
2002 to 2014, the prevalence of past month marijuana use 
increased by 35.0% (from 6.2% in 2002 to 8.4% in 2014; 
p<0.001) among persons aged ≥12 years. The prevalence of past 
month marijuana use increased among persons aged ≥18 years; 
the increase was greatest among adults aged ≥55 years (Table 2). 
In general, the prevalence of past month marijuana use increased 
across the majority of selected demographic characteristics (i.e., 
sex, race/ethnicity, highest level of education completed, current 
employment status, and U.S. geographic region) (Figures 1–5).
Past Year Use
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of past year 
marijuana use among persons aged ≥12 years was 13.2%. From 
2002 to 2014, the prevalence of marijuana use in the past year 
increased by 20.0% (from 11.0% in 2002 to 13.2% in 2014; 
p<0.001) among persons aged ≥12 years. The prevalence of 
past year marijuana use decreased by 17.0% (from 15.8% 
in 2002 to 13.1% in 2014; p<0.001) among persons aged 
BOX.  (Continued) Marijuana use and related indicators — National Survey on Drug Use and Health
 
– (Defined as those aged 12–17 years [youth] who 
reported that they strongly disapprove or somewhat 
disapprove of peers using marijuana once a month 
or more; indicator was also restricted to respondents 
aged 12–17 years who reported past month marijuana 
use): “How do you feel about someone your age using 
marijuana once a month or more?” (For the 2002–2014 
NSDUH surveys, the words “or hashish” were omitted.)
Perception of availability and mode of acquisition
• Perceived availability (defined as those who reported 
that it would be fairly easy or very easy for them to 
obtain marijuana if they wanted some): “How 
difficult or easy would it be for you to get some 
marijuana, if you wanted some?” (Answers were 
restricted to fairly easy or very easy.)
• Mode of acquisition (defined as those who reported 
how they got the marijuana they used for the last time 
[i.e., bought it, traded something for it, got it for free 
or shared with someone else, or grew it yourself]. 
(This question was only asked of those respondents 
indicating use of marijuana in the past 12 months): 
“Now think about the last time you used marijuana. 
How did you get this marijuana?”
Marijuana dependence and abuse
• The questions related to dependence within the past 
12 months ask about health and emotional problems 
associated with substance use, unsuccessful attempts to 
reduce use, tolerance, withdrawal, reducing other 
activities to use substances, spending a lot of time 
engaging in activities related to substance use, or using 
the substance in greater quantities or for a longer time 
than intended. The questions related to abuse within 
the past 12 months ask about problems at work, home, 
and school; problems with family or friends; physical 
danger; and trouble with the law because of substance 
use. (Indicator was also restricted to respondents who 
reported past year marijuana use.)
Marijuana possession–criminal justice
• Perception of legal penalty for marijuana possession 
(defined as those who reported their perception of the 
maximum legal penalty in their state of residence for 
first offense possession of an ounce or less of marijuana 
for their own use): “What is the maximum legal 
penalty in [your state] for first offense possession of an 
ounce or less of marijuana for your own use?”

12–17 years. In contrast, the prevalence of past year marijuana 
use increased by 7.0% among persons aged 18–25 years (from 
29.8% in 2002 to 31.9% in 2014; p<0.001) and by 44.0% 
among those aged ≥26 years (from 7.0% in 2002 to 10.1% in 
2014; p<0.001) (Table 3).
Daily or Almost Daily Use
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of daily or 
almost daily use of marijuana in the past year and in the 
past month among persons aged ≥12 years was 2.5% and 
3.5%, respectively. From 2002 to 2014, the prevalence 
of daily or almost daily marijuana use in the past year 
increased by 92.0% (from 1.3% in 2002 to 2.5% in 2014; 
p<0.001) and in the past month increased by 75.0% (from 
2.0% in 2002 to 3.5% in 2014; p<0.001) among persons 
aged ≥12 years. Stratifying the data by age, an increase in 
past year and past month daily or almost daily use occurred 
among almost all persons aged ≥18 years, but a decrease 
occurred among persons aged 12–17 years (Table 4). These 
trends were the same when restricting the analyses to only 
past year or past month marijuana users for the reporting 
period (Table 5).
Marijuana Initiation
Initiation and Mean Age
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of past year 
initiation among persons at risk (i.e., those who did not use 
marijuana in their lifetime or who used marijuana for the first 
time during the preceding 12 months) among persons aged 
≥12 years was 1.7%. From 2002 to 2014, the prevalence of 
past year initiation among persons at risk increased by 13.0% 
(from 1.5% in 2002 to 1.7% in 2014; p<0.001) among 
persons aged ≥12 years (range: 2.1 million new users in 2002 
to 2.5 million new users in 2014); in 2014, this averaged to 
about 7,000 new users each day (approximately 1,000 more 
new users each day compared with 2002). Furthermore, the 
prevalence of past year initiation increased by 27.0% (from 
4.9% in 2002 to 6.2% in 2014; p<0.001) among persons at 
risk aged 18–25 years. Overall, the mean age at first use had 
increased for all age groups during 2002–2014. In 2014, the 
mean age at first use estimate among persons aged ≥12 years 
was <19 years; among persons aged 12–17 years, the estimated 
mean age at first use of marijuana among past year initiates 
was <15 years (Table 6).
Perception of Harm Risk, Approval,  
and Attitudes
Perceived Great Risk and No Risk from Smoking 
Marijuana Once a Month
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of perceived great 
risk from smoking marijuana once a month among persons 
aged ≥12 years was 26.5%. From 2002 to 2014, the prevalence 
of perceived great risk from smoking marijuana once a month 
decreased by 31.0% (from 38.3% in 2002 to 26.5% in 2014; 
p<0.001) among persons aged ≥12 years. A linear decrease in 
the prevalence of perceived great risk from smoking marijuana 
once a month was also observed in all age groups. Conversely, 
during 2002–2014 the percentage of persons perceiving no 
risk from smoking marijuana once a month increased in all 
age groups (Table 7).
Perceived Great Risk and No Risk from Smoking 
Marijuana Once or Twice a Week
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of perceived great 
risk from smoking marijuana once or twice a week among 
persons aged ≥12 years was 34.3%. From 2002 to 2014, the 
prevalence of perceived great risk from smoking marijuana once 
or twice a week decreased by 33.0% (from 51.3% in 2002 to 
34.3% in 2014; p<0.001) among persons aged ≥12 years. A 
linear decrease in the prevalence of perceived great risk from 
smoking marijuana once or twice a week was also observed in 
all age groups. Conversely, during 2002–2014 the percentage 
of persons perceiving no risk from smoking marijuana once or 
twice a week increased in all age groups (Table 7).
Perceived Parental Disapproval of Trying 
Marijuana Once or Twice and Using Marijuana 
Once a Month or More
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of perceived 
parental disapproval of trying marijuana once or twice among 
all persons aged 12–17 and past month marijuana users aged 
12–17 years was 95.4% and 78.5%, respectively. From 2002 
to 2014, the prevalence of perceived parental disapproval of 
trying marijuana once or twice decreased by 6.0% (from 83.8% 
in 2002 to 78.5% in 2014; p<0.001) only among past month 
marijuana users aged 12–17 years (Figure 6). No change was 
observed among all persons aged 12–17 years.

or more among all persons aged 12–17 years and past 
month marijuana users aged 12–17 years was 95.7% and 
78.8%, respectively. From 2002 to 2014, the prevalence 
of perceived parental disapproval of using marijuana once 
a month or more decreased by 1.0% among all persons 
aged 12–17 years (from 96.3% in 2002 to 95.7% in 2014; 
p<0.001) and by 8.0% (from 85.7% in 2002 to 78.8% in 
2014; p<0.001) among past month marijuana users aged 
12–17 years (Figure 7).
Attitudes Toward Peers Trying Marijuana Once or 
Twice and Using Marijuana Once a Month or More
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of disapproving 
attitudes toward peers trying marijuana once or twice among all 
persons aged 12–17 years and past month marijuana users aged 
12–17 years was 79.5% and 25.3%, respectively. From 2002 
to 2014, the prevalence of disapproving attitudes toward peers 
trying marijuana once a month or more decreased by 16.0% 
(from 30.2% in 2002 to 25.3% in 2014; p<0.001) only among 
past month marijuana users aged 12–17 years. No change was 
observed among all persons aged 12–17 years (Figure 8).
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of disapproving 
attitudes toward peers using marijuana once a month or more 
among all persons aged 12–17 years and past month marijuana 
users aged 12–17 years was 79.2% and 21.7%, respectively. 
From 2002 to 2014, the prevalence of disapproving attitudes 
toward peers using marijuana once a month or more decreased 
by 1.0% (from 80.4% in 2002 to 79.2% in 2014; p<0.001) 
among all persons aged 12–17 years. The prevalence of 
disapproving attitudes toward peers using marijuana once a 
month or more decreased by 23.0% (from 28.1% in 2002 
to 21.7% in 2014; p<0.001) among past month marijuana 
users aged 12–17 years (Figure 9).
Perception of Availability and Mode of 
Acquisition of Marijuana
Perceived Availability
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of perceived 
availability (i.e., that it would be fairly easy or very easy to obtain 
marijuana) among persons aged ≥12 years was 60.2%. From 
2002 to 2014, the perceived availability increased by 4.0% (from 
58.0% in 2002 to 60.2% in 2014; p<0.05) among persons aged 
≥12 years. In contrast, the perceived availability decreased by 
13.0% among persons aged 12–17 years (from 55.0% in 2002 
to 47.8% in 2014; p<0.001) and by 3.0% among persons aged 
18–25 years (from 77.4% in 2002 to 74.9% in 2014; p<0.001). 
The prevalence of perceived availability of marijuana increased 
by 8.0% (from 54.9% in 2002 to 59.2% in 2014; p<0.001) 
among persons aged ≥26 years (Table 8).
Mode of Acquisition
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of self-reported 
modes of marijuana acquisition among past year marijuana 
users aged ≥12 years was bought it (48.4%), traded something 
for it (1.1%), got it for free or shared with someone else 
(49.3%), and grew it yourself (1.2%). From 2002 to 2014, 
the prevalence of modes of acquisition increased by 20.0% 
when bought it was reported (from 40.4% in 2002 to 48.4% 
in 2014; p<0.001), increased by 100% when grew it yourself 
was reported (from 0.6% in 2002 to 1.2% in 2014; p<0.001), 
and decreased by 14.0% when got it for free or shared with 
someone else was reported (from 57.6% in 2002 to 49.3% in 
2014; p<0.001) among persons aged ≥12 years. Furthermore, 
a linear increase in the prevalence of modes of acquisition was 
observed in the majority of age groups when bought it and 
grew it yourself were reported. In contrast, a linear decrease 
in the prevalence of modes of acquisition was observed in all 
age groups when got it for free or shared with someone else 
were reported (Table 8).
Marijuana Dependence and Abuse
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of past year 
marijuana dependence and abuse among all persons aged 
≥12 years and past year marijuana users aged ≥12 years was 
1.6% and 11.9%, respectively. From 2002 to 2014, the 
prevalence of past year marijuana dependence and abuse 
decreased by 11.0% among all persons aged ≥12 years (from 
1.8% in 2002 to 1.6% in 2014; p<0.001) and 29.0% (from 
16.7% in 2002 to 11.9% in 2014; p<0.001) among past year 
marijuana users aged ≥12 years. In general, a linear decrease was 
observed in the prevalence of past year marijuana dependence 
and abuse among all persons aged ≥12 years (Table 9) and past 
year marijuana users (Table 10) in the majority of age groups.
Marijuana Possession–Criminal Justice
In 2014, the estimated national prevalence of self-reported 
perceived maximum legal penalty for first offense possession of 
an ounce or less of marijuana for own use among persons aged 
≥12 years was a fine (36.3%), probation (16.7%), community 
service (7.1%), possible prison sentence (27.3%), mandatory 
prison sentence (4.8%), and no penalty (7.9%). From 2002 
to 2014, the prevalence of self-reported perceived maximum 
legal penalty for first offense possession of an ounce or less of 
marijuana for own use increased by 25.0% for a fine (from

In contrast, the prevalence of perceived maximum legal penalty 
for first offense possession of an ounce or less of marijuana for 
own use decreased by 6.0% for probation (from 17.8% in 2002 
to 16.7% in 2014; p<0.001), by 23.0% for community service 
(from 9.2% in 2002 to 7.1% in 2014; p<0.001), by 26.0% 
for possible prison sentence (from 37.0% in 2002 to 27.3% in 
2014; p<0.001), and by 30.0% for mandatory prison sentence 
(from 6.9% in 2002 to 4.8% in 2014; p<0.001). In general, 
a linear increase in the prevalence of perceived maximum 
legal penalty of a fine and no penalty was observed in all age 
groups. In contrast, a linear decrease in perceived maximum 
legal penalty of probation, community service, possible prison 
sentence, and mandatory prison sentence was observed in the 
majority of age groups (Table 11).
Discussion
This report represents, for the first time, an overview of national 
estimates for marijuana use and other related indicators among 
the U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian population aged ≥12 years 
using 2002–2014 NSDUH data. The report includes at least 
seven important findings. First, in 2014, a total of 2.5 million 
persons aged ≥12 years had used marijuana for the first time 
during the preceding 12 months, an average of approximately 
7,000 new users each day. Second, during 2002–2014, the 
prevalence of marijuana use during the past month, past 
year, and daily or almost daily increased among persons aged 
≥18 years, but not among those aged 12–17 years. Third, 
among persons aged ≥12 years, the prevalence of perceived 
great risk from smoking marijuana once or twice a week and 
once a month decreased and the prevalence of perceived no 
risk increased. Fourth, the prevalence of past year marijuana 
dependence and abuse decreased, except among persons aged 
≥26 years. Fifth, among persons aged ≥12 years, the percentage 
reporting that marijuana was fairly easy or very easy to obtain 
increased. Sixth, the percentage of persons aged ≥12 years 
reporting the mode of acquisition of marijuana was buying it 
and growing it increased versus getting it for free and sharing 
it. Finally, the percentage of persons aged ≥12 years reporting 
that the perceived maximum legal penalty for the possession 
of an ounce or less of marijuana in their state is a fine and 
no penalty increased versus probation, community service, 
possible prison sentence, and mandatory prison sentence.
During 2002–2014, national estimates for marijuana use 
have decreased, specifically the past month, past year, and daily 
or almost daily marijuana use and past year new initiates among 
the U.S. population aged 12–17 years. Concurrently, state laws 
and policies regarding medical or recreational marijuana use 
have changed (13). Although these behavioral changes in the 
U.S. population are temporally related to the implementation 
of new state laws and policies, findings cannot be used to infer 
causality. Legalization of recreational marijuana in some states 
is relatively recent, and continued monitoring of marijuana 
use and frequency of use among youth is needed because 
these effects might be delayed. Use patterns among youth 
do not yet provide an accurate reflection of how legalization 
in some states will affect national estimates on marijuana 
use. In the interim, additional evaluation might determine 
that community-based substance use prevention efforts have 
contributed to this decline.
Since 2002, the prevalence of marijuana use and initiation 
among U.S. youth has declined. However, findings also indicate 
that among youth and adults, the prevalence of perceived great 
risk from smoking marijuana has steadily decreased and the 
prevalence of perceived no risk from smoking marijuana 
once or twice a week and once a month has increased. In 
previous national survey analyses, perception of risk has 
been inversely associated with prevalence of use (14–17). 
The data in this report document that the inverse association 
between perception of great risk from smoking marijuana and 
prevalence of use was observed only among adults. The fact 
that this inverse association was not found among youth is 
notable, given the hypothesis that legalization of medical and 
recreational marijuana use could lead to increases in youth 
initiation. One possible explanation could be that changes in 
state laws might require more time to be reflected in measurable 
national changes in use among youth. In addition, despite 
increased perceptions of no risk from smoking marijuana, 
obtaining marijuana nationally remains more difficult for 
persons aged 12–17 years than for those aged ≥18, which could 
explain the lower prevalence of marijuana use and initiation 
in this age group. In fact, since 2002 the perceived availability 
(i.e., fairly easy or very easy to obtain marijuana) among 
persons aged 12–17 and 18–25 years has decreased. However, 
more local or regional surveillance data are needed to better 
understand how retail legalization might affect accessibility. 
Identifying and implementing policies that continue to restrict 
youth access to marijuana remain important. Ongoing public 
health prevention efforts are warranted to prevent increases in 
marijuana initiation and use among youth.
Although NSDUH data suggest increases in daily and 
almost daily use among adults (both in the overall population 
and among adult marijuana users), they also suggest steady 
decreases in the prevalence of marijuana dependence and 
abuse among adult marijuana users since 2002. Typically,

increased prevalence of marijuana use has been linked to 
increased prevalence of marijuana dependence or abuse (17). 
These findings suggest that refined measures of frequency (e.g., 
number of times per day, week, month, or year) of use might 
be needed to better quantify how often and what types of 
products (e.g., inhaled, eaten, infused, drank) persons are using 
to better estimate and understand marijuana consumption in 
the United States. With changes in medical marijuana laws 
(13) and, in particular, state laws or policies allowing limited 
access to low percentages of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC) or cannabidiol (CBD), persons who use marijuana 
daily for medical reasons might be using strains that pose lower 
risk for dependence or abuse. As marijuana use becomes more 
commonplace, different patterns of use behavior might account 
for a substantial proportion of the increase in marijuana use 
among persons aged ≥18 years. Therefore, more research and 
surveillance data on marijuana use, frequency of use, and 
dependence are warranted.
Public Health Implications
Reducing Marijuana Use Among Youth
Heavy or frequent marijuana use has a negative effect on 
cognitive development, academic achievement, and other 
health risk behaviors among youth (2–8). Therefore, strategies 
to prevent youth access and use are still needed. Under the 
Controlled Substances Act** marijuana is still considered an 
illegal Schedule I drug. However, since 1996, approximately 
40 states have legalized marijuana or allowed the use of 
products containing CBD, a less-psychoactive compound of 
the cannabis plant, for medical conditions, retail sales, or both 
(four states have legalized retail marijuana sales, the District 
of Columbia has legalized personal use and home cultivation, 
23 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical 
marijuana use, and 17 states have legalized CBD use) (13). 
In 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice issued guidance†† 
on enforcement priorities that included preventing the 
distribution of marijuana to minors. Although recent trend 
data from NSDUH regarding marijuana use at the aggregate 
national level provides some short-term reassurance that 
national-level increases in use among persons aged 12–17 years 
have not yet resulted from the policy change, any reassurance 
is tempered by the knowledge that this situation might not 
be stable. Changes allowing for legal medical or recreational 
marijuana use, combined with the decreased prevalence of 
perceived great risk from smoking marijuana, potentially 
could lead to increased use patterns in other age groups. 
In addition, a study of confiscated marijuana by the Drug 
Enforcement Administration indicated an increase in potency 
(i.e., higher levels of THC, the psychoactive compound) of 
the cannabis plant, potentially posing higher risk for adverse 
health consequences from marijuana use, particularly among 
youth (18). Given the variability of state-level legalization of 
medical and recreational marijuana (13) and the increased 
potency of the marijuana plant (18), improved surveillance 
and increased attention to public health prevention strategies 
are warranted at the federal, state, and local levels. Regardless 
of whether legalization of medical and recreational marijuana 
expands or diminishes, public health and other organizations 
can consider important steps (e.g., educational and prevention 
activities) to minimize health harms.
Future Directions
On the basis of findings from this report and awareness of 
state-level legalization of medical and recreational marijuana, 
the implications for public health surveillance, research, and 
practice are numerous. These implications include quality, 
relevance, and timeliness of surveillance capacity in the 
United States at the national, state, and local levels; initiation 
and use of marijuana among youth; and minimization 
and prevention of health harms and disparities related to 
marijuana initiation, use, and abuse, especially among 
populations at high risk (e.g., pregnant women, racial and 
ethnic minorities, and persons with cormorbid mental health 
and other substance abuse conditions).
Quality, Relevance, and Timeliness of  
Surveillance Capacity
NSDUH monitors trends on behavioral health measures, 
including marijuana use and related indicators. However, 
legislative and policy changes across states might require 
modifications to national- and state-level surveys (e.g., 
NSDUH, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, and Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey) to monitor behavioral health changes in the 
United States. Additional questions about mode of marijuana 
use (e.g., smoked, vaped, dabbed, eaten, or drunk), specific 
quantities of marijuana used (not just number of days of use), 
and reasons for use (e.g., medical, recreational, or both) could 
be added to existing surveillance systems or launched in new 
systems. In addition to traditional public health surveillance, 
innovative partnerships using health care systems, hospital 
and emergency department databases, rapid-cycle surveillance

tools, and data from nonhealth-care sectors (e.g., education, 
transportation, and law enforcement) could more fully assess 
the prevalence and public health impact of marijuana use in 
the United States. Furthermore, it is important to understand 
local community risk and protective factors associated with 
marijuana initiation and use among youth. Guidelines to 
recognize these factors and ways to identify multilevel factors 
within a community to reduce marijuana use among youth 
have been published by SAMHSA (19–21).
Many health risks, especially adverse effects associated with 
marijuana use (e.g., respiratory cancers, depressive disorders, 
and suicide) are still not well understood (3). In March 2016, 
the National Institute on Drug Abuse convened a group of 
experts to review the current body of science.§§ CDC, working 
with other federal, state, and nongovernmental organizations, 
commissioned a National Academy of Sciences evidence 
summary review, including a vison for future research needs. 
Other federal agencies, including National Institutes of Health, 
SAMHSA, and the Food and Drug Administration, engaged 
with academic institutions and other stakeholders to increase 
the depth and breadth of knowledge. More information 
about the harms and potential benefits of marijuana and 
its components could be obtained from enhancements to 
established behavioral health surveillance systems or state or 
local surveys.
Youth Initiation and Use of Marijuana
Findings from this report suggest progress in preventing 
marijuana use among youth (19–21), but continued prevention 
efforts are needed to address low perceived risk for harm and 
perceived marijuana availability (i.e., less likely to obtain 
marijuana). The evidence for significant short- and long-term 
negative effects from marijuana use is consistent and strong 
especially at younger ages when the brain is still developing 
(2–5,7). To prevent marijuana initiation and use among 
youth, public health professionals could consider modifying 
or augmenting successful policies that target tobacco, alcohol, 
and other substances used or abused by youth. For example, 
as previously done with tobacco prevention campaigns, 
carefully designed and well-funded public health campaigns 
at the local, state, and national levels warning about the 
negative consequences of marijuana use could help prevent 
increases in youth initiation. Taxation strategies for legally 
purchased marijuana that dedicate funding for education 
and treatment and help maintain price barriers might be 
important in preventing youth initiation. Finally, in states 
allowing marijuana sales to adults, strict regulations and 
enforcement of under-21 sales and marketing restrictions 
remain necessary to prevent adverse effects associated with 
marijuana use. Additional research into these and other policy-
based approaches to prevent youth initiation, use, and abuse of 
marijuana could be used to develop new interventions.
Minimization and Prevention of Health Harms 
and Health Disparities Related to Initiation, Use, 
and Abuse of Marijuana
Data from NSDUH demonstrate disparities in use and abuse 
of marijuana in some age groups. This report did not focus on 
disparities related to socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and 
other sociodemographic variables, but rather on monitoring 
national trends during 2002–2014 by three age groups. National 
(and particularly state-level) data from NSDUH suggest 
important differences in marijuana use and abuse among youth 
and other subpopulations. These subpopulations merit special 
attention in marijuana-related public health programs, in terms 
of public education and policy development. Oversampling 
high-risk populations (e.g., pregnant and breastfeeding women, 
racial and ethnic minorities, the homeless population, and 
persons with comorbid mental health and other substance abuse 
conditions) is particularly important as marijuana state laws and 
policies change.
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, they are limited to the 2002–2014 survey 
cycles. Substantial methodological changes in NSDUH during 
1999–2001 prevent trend analysis before 2002. Second, 
substance use might be underestimated due to self-report bias 
and social desirability bias. Third, these analyses are limited 
to household respondents, which might have excluded some 
groups at high risk (e.g., homeless persons) for marijuana 
use. Finally, NSDUH’s question on perception of great risk 
from smoking marijuana is subjective. The question does not 
distinguish between the respondent’s own use of marijuana 
once a month and once or twice a week, or the general 
population. Additional cognitive testing might help clarify 
how respondents conceptualize the question.
Conclusion
Since 1971, NSDUH has been a principal national data 
source reporting on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and 
tobacco. Data can be used to monitor marijuana use and 
behavior at the national and state levels and to help public

health officials identify populations with or at risk for 
marijuana use disorders or dependence. Finally, these data 
can help monitor progress and challenges remaining toward 
achieving national Healthy People 2020 (22) and state objectives 
for marijuana use and perceptions of harm risk among youth. 
These data can be particularly important for monitoring, 
planning, implementing, and evaluating behavioral health 
indicators on marijuana use and perceptions, especially in 
at-risk populations. Nuances of marijuana laws across states 
might suggest additional questions for national and state 
surveys on substance use. Timely and constant monitoring of 
behavioral measures trends is vital for effective and targeted 
public health interventions. Because of increases in perception 
of no risk from smoking marijuana, increases in past month 
marijuana use among adults, and state-level law and policy 
changes, further attention to marijuana use among youth and 
abuse and dependence among adults is warranted.

* Perceived availability is defined as those who reported that it would be fairly easy or very easy for them to obtain marijuana if they wanted some.
† Mode of acquisition is defined as those who reported how they got the marijuana they used for the last time (i.e., bought it, traded something for it, got it for free or shared with someone 
else, or grew it yourself).
§ Linear trends were assessed using logistic regression model from the 2002–2014 survey years.
¶ Logistic regression (p≤0.05).

 * Perception of legal penalty for marijuana possession is defined as those who reported their perception of the maximum legal penalty in their state of residence for first offense possession 
of an ounce or less of marijuana for their own use.
 † Linear trends were assessed using logistic regression model from the 2002–2014 survey years.
 § Logistic regression (p≤0.05).
 ¶ Tests of slopes should be interpreted with caution given that not all responses options are available for each year of data collection and the percentages are distributions (i.e., they are 
affected by the presence or absence of response options).
 ** Percentage change differences calculations are made from the 2006–2014 survey cycles.
