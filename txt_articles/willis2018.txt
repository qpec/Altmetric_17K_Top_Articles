IMPORTANCE Cardiorespiratory fitness (hereinafter referred to as fitness) as estimated by
exercise testing is a modifiable risk factor independently associated with chronic diseases,
cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and mortality, but the association of fitness at midlife
with incidence of later-life depression and the risk of CVD mortality after a depression
diagnosis is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether fitness measured in midlife would be inversely associated
with later-life CVD mortality with antecedent depression.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study at a single-center,
community-based preventive medicine clinic was performed as part of the Cooper Center
Longitudinal Study. Data were collected from January 13, 1971, through December 31, 2009,
and analyzed from October 6, 2015, through August 14, 2017. Participants included generally
healthy men and women who presented for preventive medicine examinations at midlife and
who were eligible for Medicare from 1999 to 2010. Those with a self-reported history of
depression, myocardial infarction, or stroke at examination were excluded.
EXPOSURES Objective midlife fitness estimated from results of treadmill exercise testing.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depression diagnosis from Medicare claims files using
established algorithms and CVD mortality from National Death Index records.
RESULTS A total of 17 989 participants (80.2% men) with a mean (SD) age of 50.0 (8.7) years
were included. After 117 218 person-years of Medicare follow-up, 2701 depression diagnoses,
610 deaths due to CVD without prior depression, and 231 deaths due to CVD after depression
were observed. A high level of fitness in midlife was associated with a 16% lower risk of
depression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.95) compared with a low level of fitness.
A high fitness level was also associated with a 61% lower risk of death due to CVD without
depression (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.31-0.48) compared with a low level of fitness. After a
diagnosis of depression, a high fitness level was associated with a 56% lower risk of death
due to CVD (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.31-0.64) compared with a low fitness level.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Midlife fitness is associated with a lower risk of later-life
depression, CVD mortality, and CVD mortality after incident later-life depression. These
findings suggest the importance of midlife fitness in primary prevention of depression and
subsequent CVD mortality in older age and should encourage physicians to consider fitness
and physical activity in promoting healthy aging.

epression and depressive disorders are common con-
ditions affecting older individuals and are associated
with cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the presence of
CVD events, the prevalence of depression is high, with as many
as 1 in 5 patients with CVD having depression, especially after
stroke.1Conversely,depressionislinkedwithCVDmortality.2-4
In fact, a 2014 American Heart Association Scientific State-
ment evaluated 53 studies and concluded that depression
should be elevated as a risk factor for adverse outcomes in pa-
tients with acute coronary syndrome.5
Given that CVD remains a leading cause of death in the
United States, primary prevention of CVD has been advo-
cated through assessment of multiple risk factors and prac-
tice guidelines with ongoing updates.6 The American Psycho-
logical Association has also encouraged engagement by
psychologists in primary prevention for behavioral and men-
tal disorders.7 Considering the large health burden of depres-
sive disorders, interventional approaches alone may be inad-
equate and lack cost-effectiveness, further supporting
incorporation of a preventive approach.8,9 Because many of
the risk factors for depression, such as life events or adverse
socioeconomic factors, are not easily modifiable, the specific
approach to prevention may not be clear, and research spe-
cifically addressing long-term risk reduction in this area has
been advocated.10
A modifiable risk factor for depressive and CVD condi-
tions is cardiorespiratory fitness (hereinafter referred to as
fitness).11-16 Fitness is inversely associated with all-cause and
CVD mortality11,13,17 and a lower incidence of depression and
physician visits concerning depression.18-21
ConsideringthelinkofdepressiontoCVD,amodifiablerisk
factor such as fitness with the potential to lower the risk of de-
pression and CVD sequelae in aging adults would be useful.
However, the association between midlife fitness and later-
life depression with subsequent CVD mortality has not been
evaluated. We hypothesized that a higher level of fitness in
middle age would be associated with a lower risk of depres-
sion in older age and a lower risk of CVD mortality after inci-
dent depression. By linking the Cooper Center Longitudinal
Study (CCLS) with claims data from the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services, we studied the association of fitness in
midlife with the subsequent risk of depression diagnosis and
CVD mortality.
Methods
Study Population
The CCLS is an updated continuation of the Aerobics Center
Longitudinal Study, an ongoing, prospective study at The Coo-
per Institute in Dallas, Texas, that began in 1970.11,13,22 Pa-
tients evaluated at the Cooper Clinic and included as partici-
pants in the CCLS are generally well-educated, non-Hispanic
whitepatientswithaccesstohealthcare.Patientsreceiveapre-
ventivemedicalexaminationthatincludesself-reportedmedi-
cal and lifestyle history, physician-administered physical ex-
amination, anthropometric measurements, fasting laboratory

collected from January 13, 1971, through December 31, 2009.
Participants provide written informed consent for inclusion in
the research database, and the study is reviewed and ap-
proved annually by the institutional review board of The Coo-
per Institute.
Atotalof19 241patientsenrolledintheCCLSwhohadcom-
plete information to determine their midlife health status and
were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare coverage from Janu-
ary 1, 1999, through December 31, 2009, were considered for
inclusion in the study. After excluding 901 individuals with a
historyofdepressionand351individualswithahistoryofCVD,
including myocardial infarction and stroke, at the time of the
midlife examination, a final sample size of 17 989 was in-
cluded in this analysis. Participants were followed up from the
date of initiating Medicare coverage until death or the end of
follow-up on December 31, 2009.
The measurements of baseline variables in the CCLS have
beenwelldescribedandwereobtainedinaccordancewithstan-
dard protocols.11,13 Body mass index was calculated as mea-
sured weight in kilograms divided by measured height in me-
ters squared. Seated resting blood pressure was obtained with

Key Points
Question Is higher cardiorespiratory fitness in midlife associated
with a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality after incident
depression past 65 years of age?
Findings In this cohort study of Medicare-eligible patients, higher
levels of fitness in midlife were associated with a 16% lower risk of
depression. In addition, after a diagnosis of depression, higher
levels of fitness were associated with a 56% lower risk of
cardiovascular mortality.
Meaning Men and women who are more physically fit at midlife
have a lower risk of depression and cardiovascular mortality after
a diagnosis of depression in later life, suggesting that fitness is an
important part of a primary preventive strategy for cardiovascular
disease and depression across the lifespan.

Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed from October 6, 2015, through August 14,
2017. Patient characteristics at midlife were summarized by fit-
nesslevel,andincidenceratesofdepressionandCVDdeathwere
compared across strata of fitness using an exponential survival
model. A failure time model was used to investigate the multi-

Results
Weincludedatotalof17 989participants(3559women[19.8%]
and 14 430 men [80.2%]) with a mean (SD) age of 50.0 (8.7)
years at the midlife examination. Baseline midlife character-
istics of the study participants by fitness category are summa-
rized in Table 1. Compared with participants in the low fit-
ness category, those in the high fitness category had a lower
mean body mass index (24.4 [2.9] vs 27.9 [4.7]), lower sys-
tolic blood pressure (120.8 [14.8] vs 123.6 [15.0] mm Hg), and
more favorable mean levels of total cholesterol (208.8 [37.0]
vs 219.7 [41.2] mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, mul-
tiply by 0.0259]) and fasting glucose (98.5 (12.3) vs 103.3 [22.1]
mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555])
(Table 1).
After 117 218 person-years of follow up, we observed 2701
diagnoses of depression and 841 deaths due to CVD. Two hun-
dred thirty-one deaths were due to CVD after incident depres-
sion and 610 without incident depression. Incidence rates of
depression and CVD mortality are summarized in the Figure.
The rates of depression diagnosis in later life as well as CVD
mortality after depression and CVD mortality without inci-
dent depression showed significant declines from low to mod-
erate to high fitness categories assessed in midlife. Com-
pared with the low fitness category, the rate of depression in
the high fitness category was 22.2 per 1000 person-years (1041
diagnoses) and 26.2 in the moderate fitness category (1136 di-
agnoses) vs 30.7 in the low fitness category (524 diagnoses).
For CVD mortality without incident depression, the rate in the
highfitnesscategorywas3.9deathsper1000person-years(184
deaths) vs 5.7 in the moderate fitness category (249 deaths)
and 10.4 in the low fitness category (177 deaths); for CVD mor-
tality after depression, the rate in the high fitness category was
16.1 deaths per 1000 person-years (61 deaths) vs 25.8 in the
moderate fitness category (107 deaths) and 32.9 in the low fit-
ness category (63 deaths) (Figure).
Multivariate analyses revealed a consistent association
with higher midlife fitness and a lower risk of incident depres-
sion, CVD mortality, and CVD mortality after a diagnosis of de-
pression (Table 2 and Table 3). In analyses stratified by midlife

Discussion
In the present study, we observed 2 important findings. First,
in a large, generally healthy cohort of men and women, higher
midlife fitness was associated with lower risk of a depression
diagnosis after 65 years of age. Second, not only was higher
midlife fitness associated with a lower risk of CVD mortality,
but importantly, it was also associated with a lower risk of
CVD mortality when CVD death was preceded by depression.
This association was notable in later life years after the fit-
ness assessment.
Depression and CVD are the most common causes of dis-
ability in the developed nations of the world, a connection be-
tween depression and CVD has been recognized for a number
ofyears,32andahigherprevalenceofdepressionhasbeenfound
in patients with myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart
failure.33-35Reviewsofpublishedstudiesofdepressionasarisk
factor for mortality in CVD and coronary heart disease3 have
shown considerable variation in methods, measurements, and
cohorts and, in fact, some reluctance to assign depression as a
risk factor for coronary heart disease because of the uncer-
tainty as to the direction of causality. However, the prepon-
derance of evidence supports classifying depression as a
risk factor for adverse outcomes in CVD and coronary heart
disease.2,5 Several physiologic mechanisms that may be com-
montodepressionandCVDhavebeensuggestedtoexplainthe
observed associations. These mechanisms include inflamma-
tory changes, platelet aggregation, hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis dysregulation, and autonomic dysfunction lead-
ing to an increase in arrhythmia and myocardial ischemia.36-38
Cardiorespiratory fitness has been shown to be favorably as-
sociated with risk of these proposed intermediaries, although
the directionality of these associations is unclear.39-41
Higher fitness has been associated with a lower risk for all-
causeandCVDmortality,11,13,42andimprovementinfitnesslevel
hasalsobeenshowntobeassociatedwithlowermortalityrisk.26
A number of studies have shown that higher fitness is associ-
ated with a lower risk of nonfatal outcomes, including myocar-
dial infarction and heart failure, as well as depression.14,18,43,44

dence and cost-effectiveness.5,45,46
Intervention studies have shown that exercise, which is
known to increase fitness in individuals with depression,48 has
anevidentantidepressanteffectwhenusedinindividualswith
mild to moderate depression in the short term.20 A recent large
cohort study of 33 908 healthy adults followed up for 11 years
also showed that regular leisure time exercise of any inten-
sity provided protection against future depression.9 Prior
work14,16 has shown the association of higher levels of midlife
fitness with a lower risk of CVD conditions in later life, such
as stroke, that are associated with depression. In addition, fit-
ness in the years before diagnosis of cancer can play a role in
influencing the health outcomes after such a condition
develops.49
Because effective, acute management of depression alone
is not likely to relieve more than a portion of the overall bur-
denofdepressivedisorders,earlypreventionofdepressionand
CVD would be valuable if the primary risk modification was ef-
fective and enduring across the lifespan.6-9 A new and inter-
esting finding in this study is that higher fitness assessed in
middleageisassociatedwithalowerriskofCVDmortalityeven
in the presence of incident depression, with the fitness effect
extending many years into older age. Health care costs and use
of services are greatly increased in the setting of heart disease
combinedwiththecomorbidconditionofdepression,andthese
findingssuggestthatloweringriskthroughearlypreventionef-
forts may have economic as well as health benefits.50,51
We were not able to gauge how changes in fitness would
affect risk in the later years of the cohort; however, fitness50,51
canbeimprovedinmostindividualsbyaerobictraining,which
need not be complicated or expensive.52,53 Despite this
finding, surveys indicate that only about 50% of adults meet
aerobic exercise guidelines and far fewer meet muscle-
strengthening and aerobic guidelines.54,55
Strengths and Limitations
This study has several important strengths, including a large,
homogeneouspopulationandlongfollow-up.Althoughthepri-
mary racial/ethnic composition of non-Hispanic white pa-
tients and generally higher socioeconomic class may de-
crease generalizability, the healthy nature of this population
with access to preventive health care allows evaluation of the
association of fitness on a primordial basis and avoids the ef-
fect of unmeasured confounders. The association of risk fac-
tors and lifetime risk of CVD have been shown to be similar to
that of the general population.42 The fitness measurement is
objectiveandhenceprovidesamoreaccuratepictureofmidlife
physical activity level than self-report would because fitness
correlates well with activity level. In addition, the outcomes
are based on administrative claims data provided by the health
care professional and are likely more accurate than self-
report, especially in older patients.56
LimitationsincludethatdiagnosesdeterminedfromMedi-
careclaimsdataarenotclinicallyadjudicated.Wewerenotable
to detect outcomes or physician visits occurring between the
midlife examination and Medicare eligibility, nor were we able
to determine severity of the depression. However, Medicare
data has been used by other researchers with a similar ap-
proach to provide informative findings regarding the associa-
tion of traditional risk factors with Medicare outcomes.57-59 Of
importance,informationabouttheuseofmedicationthatcould
influence the presence or the absence of depression diagno-
sis is not available for this cohort. Finally, we cannot elimi-
nate the possibility of depression and CVD leading to lower fit-
ness levels. However, the relatively long mean period from
fitness measure to Medicare observation makes such reverse
causation less likely.
Conclusions
This study shows that being fit at midlife is associated with a
lower risk of later-life depression and subsequent CVD mor-
tality, even in the presence of depression. These findings sug-
gest the importance of fitness in primary prevention of heart
diseaseandassociatedCVDmortalityinolderagingadults.This
study further supports the critical need for health care pro-
fessionals to consider fitness and physical activity as part of
overall preventive care to promote healthy aging.
