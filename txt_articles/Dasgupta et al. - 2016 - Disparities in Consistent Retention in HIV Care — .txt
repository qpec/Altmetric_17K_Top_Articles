National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness 
Day — February 7, 2016
February 7 is National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness 
Day, which is intended to raise awareness of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which causes 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The 
observance also encourages action, such as HIV testing, to 
reduce the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on non-
Hispanic blacks/African Americans (blacks) in the United 
States. From 2010 to 2014, the annual HIV diagnosis rate 
decreased for blacks (1). However, blacks continued to 
account for nearly half of all HIV diagnoses each year, with 
most diagnoses occurring among gay and bisexual men (2).
In 2014, blacks accounted for 44% of new HIV 
diagnoses, with men accounting for 73% of these 
diagnoses (1). The annual HIV diagnosis rate for black 
women (30.0 per 100,000) was 18 times the rate for white 
women (1.7) and five times the rate for Hispanic/Latino 
women (6.5). Among blacks living with HIV in 2011, 
85% received an HIV diagnosis, 40% were engaged in 
HIV care, 36% were prescribed antiretroviral therapy, and 
28% were virally suppressed (3).

In 2013, 45% of new human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection diagnoses occurred in non-Hispanic blacks/
African Americans (blacks) (1), who represent 12% of the U.S. 
population.* Antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves clinical 
outcomes and reduces transmission of HIV, which causes 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (2). Racial/
ethnic disparities in HIV care limit access to ART, perpetuating 
disparities in survival and reduced HIV transmission. National

goals to improve care among persons living with HIV and 
to reduce HIV-related disparities.† CDC used NHSS data to 
describe retention in HIV care over 3 years and describe dif-
ferences by race/ethnicity. Among persons with HIV infection 
diagnosed in 2010 who were alive in December 2013, 38% 
of blacks with HIV infection were consistently retained in 
care during 2011–2013, compared with 50% of Hispanics/
Latinos (Hispanics) and 49% of non-Hispanic whites (whites). 
Differences in consistent retention in care by race/ethnicity 
persisted when groups were stratified by sex or transmission 
category. Among blacks, 35% of males were consistently 
retained in care compared with 44% of females. Differences in 
HIV care retention by race/ethnicity were established during 
the first year after diagnosis. Efforts to establish early HIV care 
among blacks are needed to mitigate racial/ethnic disparities 
in HIV outcomes over time.
All states and U.S. territories report cases of HIV infections 
and associated demographic and clinical information to NHSS. 
CDC analyzed data from NHSS reported through July 2015 
from 12 jurisdictions with complete laboratory reporting 
from January 2010–December 2013.§ These jurisdictions 
accounted for 25% of HIV diagnoses reported in the United 
States for 2010. This analysis includes persons aged ≥13 years 
who received a diagnosis of HIV infection in 2010 and were 
alive in December 2013. Retention in HIV care, defined as 
having two or more CD4+ or viral load tests ≥3 months apart 
during a given calendar year, was assessed annually for 2011, 
2012, and 2013. The percentage of persons retained in care 
for 0, 1, 2, and 3 years during 2011–2013 was determined.

Summary
What is already known on this topic?
A higher percentage of non-Hispanic blacks/African Americans 
(blacks) received a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection in 2013 compared with other racial/ethnic groups 
in the United States. Linkage to and retention in HIV care and 
treatment are crucial to achieving sustained viral suppression, 
which can result in reduced transmission to others and improved 
clinical outcomes for persons living with HIV infection.
What is added by this report?
Fewer blacks were consistently retained in HIV care compared 
with other racial/ethnic groups, regardless of sex or transmis-
sion category; in addition, black males were less likely to be 
consistently retained than were black females. Lower levels of 
consistent retention in care among blacks were attributed to 
higher proportions of blacks not being retained in care for any 
of the 3 years during 2011–2013.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Given disparities in retention in HIV care between blacks and 
other racial/ethnic groups, identifying approaches to promote 
early linkage to and retention in care among blacks might be 
beneficial in mitigating racial/ethnic disparities in HIV outcomes.

Persons retained in care for all 3 years were considered to be 
consistently retained in HIV care. Differences in consistent 
retention in care were assessed by race/ethnicity, sex, transmis-
sion category, and state of residence at diagnosis. Results were 
statistically adjusted for missing information on transmission 
category using multiple imputation (3).
In the 12 jurisdictions, a total of 9,824 adults and adolescents 
received a diagnosis of HIV infection in 2010 and were alive 
in December 2013. Of the 9,824, 54% were black, 17% were 
Hispanic, and 24% were white. Overall, 61% were retained 
in HIV care in 2011, 50% were retained in both 2011 and 
2012, and 43% were retained during 2011–2013 (Figure 1). 
Among persons retained in care in 2011, 82% were retained in 
both 2011 and 2012. Among persons retained in care during 
both 2011 and 2012, 85% were retained during 2011–2013. 
A lower proportion of blacks were retained during 2011–2013 
(38%), compared with Hispanics (50%) and whites (49%).
Differences in consistent retention in care by race/ethnic-
ity persisted when stratified by sex or transmission category, 
with a lower proportion of blacks retained in HIV care for all 
3 years, compared with other groups (Table). Further, reten-
tion in care for all 3 years was lower among blacks in seven 
of the 12 jurisdictions (District of Columbia, Illinois, Iowa, 
Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, and New York).
A smaller percentage of black males, who accounted for more 
than two thirds of blacks with HIV diagnosed in 2010, were 
consistently retained in care during 2011–2013 compared with 
black females (35% versus 44%, respectively) (Table). Among 
blacks, consistent retention in care was highest for persons with 
infection attributable to heterosexual contact, and among these 
persons, consistent retention in care was higher for females 
(45%) than for males (37%).
Overall, 43% of all persons included in the analysis were 
retained in HIV care for all 3 years during 2011–2013.

Nineteen percent were retained 2 of the 3 years; 14% were 
retained 1 of the 3 years, and 25% were not retained in any 
of the 3 years (Figure 2). A larger proportion of blacks (28%), 
compared with Hispanics (23%) and whites (19%), were not 
retained in care during any of the 3 years.
Discussion
A substantial percentage of persons with HIV infection 
(39%) were not retained in care in the year after their diagnosis. 
However, among persons retained during earlier years after 
diagnosis, the proportion not retained during subsequent years 
was low (18% in 2012 and 15% in 2013, respectively). Fewer 
blacks were retained in HIV care compared with other racial/
ethnic groups. These findings are consistent with previous 
reports on racial/ethnic differences in HIV care engagement 
(4) and demonstrate that these disparities remain over multiple 
years. The racial/ethnic differences in HIV care retention are 
established during the first year after diagnosis, underscoring 
the importance of early engagement in care to reduce disparities 
in sustained retention in care and thus improve the resulting 
outcomes (e.g., initiation of treatment and viral suppression).
Retention in care facilitates ART adherence and early detec-
tion of comorbidities, which can result in improved survival 
and reduced transmission of infection to others (2,5). Barriers 
to retention in care, such as lack of health insurance, limited 
access to health services, and stigma, are particularly prevalent 
among blacks (6). Continuing to identify barriers to HIV care 
engagement, including those leading to prolonged lack of 
retention in care, can inform development of effective inter-
ventions to improve HIV care engagement among blacks (7).

Developing such interventions might narrow racial/ethnic 
disparities in clinical outcomes.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi-
tations. First, HIV surveillance data do not include markers 
of socioeconomic status (e.g., health insurance status, annual 
household income, or education), which could help explain 
observed disparities in HIV care engagement by racial/ethnic 
groups. Second, analyses were restricted to 12 jurisdictions 
with complete laboratory reporting during the entire analysis 
period; these 12 jurisdictions might not be representative of 
all persons living with diagnosed HIV infection. Third, this 
analysis was limited to persons with HIV infection diagnosed 
during a 1-year period; for this reason, estimates are different 
from those previously published (4). Finally, these multiyear 
estimates of retention in HIV care might be artificially lower 
if persons moved to a jurisdiction with incomplete laboratory 
reporting after receiving an HIV diagnosis; however, a previous 
analysis of HIV surveillance data concluded that interstate 
migration is relatively uncommon.¶
Focusing HIV prevention and care efforts on early diagnosis 
of HIV infection and early establishment of HIV care among 
blacks might be beneficial in reducing racial/ethnic disparities 
in HIV outcomes. Through partnerships with federal, state, 
and local health agencies, CDC is pursuing high-impact pre-
vention strategies to address the principal goals of the National 
HIV/AIDS Strategy to increase access to care and reduce 
disparities in HIV outcomes.** CDC supports projects that 
aim to reduce the proportion of undiagnosed infections in the 
United States, improve linkage to and retention in care, and 
reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality across all racial/

ethnic groups (8). CDC also supports using surveillance data 
to 1) identify persons who are not currently in care, 2) improve 
HIV care engagement, and 3) increase viral suppression (9). 
Continued collaboration among health care providers, com-
munity-based organizations, and state and local health depart-
ments can strengthen programs that support both early linkage 
to care after HIV diagnosis across all racial/ethnic groups and 
expansion of proven methods for improving retention in care 
(e.g., HIV case management, patient navigation systems, and 
co-location of medical services) (7,10).
