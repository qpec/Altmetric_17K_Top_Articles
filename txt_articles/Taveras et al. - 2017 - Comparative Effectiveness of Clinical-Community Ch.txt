 Interventions: Children were randomized to one of two arms: (1) enhanced primary care, e.g. 
flagging of children with BMI ≥ 85th percentile, clinical decision support tools for pediatric weight 
management, parent educational materials, a Neighborhood Resource Guide, and monthly text 
messages or (2) enhanced primary care plus contextually-tailored, individual health coaching 
(twice-weekly text messages and telephone or video contacts every other month) to support 
behavior change and linkage of families to neighborhood resources.
Main Outcomes: 1-year changes in age- and sex-specific BMI z-score, child health-related 
quality of life measured by the PedsQL-4.0, and parental resource empowerment.
Results: At 1 year, we obtained BMI z-scores from 664 children (92%) and family-centered 
outcomes from 657 parents (91%). Baseline mean (SD) age was 8.0 (3.0) years; 35% were white, 
33.3% black, 21.8% Hispanic, and 9.9% other. In the enhanced primary care group, adjusted mean 
(SD) BMI z-score was 1.91 (0.56) at baseline and 1.85 (0.58) at 1 year; an improvement of −0.06 
BMI z-score units (95% CI: −0.10, −0.02) from baseline to 1 year. In the enhanced primary care + 
coaching group, adjusted mean (SD) BMI z-score was 1.87 (0.56) at baseline and 1.79 (0.58) at 1 
year; an improvement of −0.09 BMI z-score units (95% CI: −0.13, −0.05). However, there was no 
significant difference between the two intervention arms (p=0.39). Both intervention arms led to 
improved parental resource empowerment. Parents in the enhanced primary care + coaching 
group, but not in the enhanced care alone group, reported improvements in their child’s health-
related quality of life (1.53 units; 95% CI: 0.51, 2.56). However, there were no significant 
differences between the intervention arms in either family-centered outcome.
Conclusions: Two interventions that included a package of high-quality clinical care for obesity 
and linkages to community resources resulted in improved family-centered outcomes for 
childhood obesity and improvements in child BMI.
BACKGROUND
Childhood overweight and obesity place a significant burden on morbidity and quality of 
life. In the United States, the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity appears to 
have plateaued and may even be decreasing among 2- to 5-year old children as of 2012.1 
Yet, overall prevalence remains at historically high levels.2,3 Clinical interventions to reduce 
obesity have been somewhat effective but are often limited in their effectiveness due to the 
myriad social and environmental barriers that impede improvement in obesity-related 
behaviors.4,5
An important, but often overlooked aspect of interventions to improve obesity is the careful 
consideration of the socio-environmental context in which decisions related to health 
behaviors are being made, and in which behavior change is expected to occur. Neighborhood 
socioeconomic characteristics and environmental resources can significantly influence 
health behaviors and may contribute to childhood obesity in vulnerable populations.6–10 
Sophisticated geographic information systems methods and community mapping can 
provide community-level data on environmental resources and this information can assist in 
developing a tailored clinical-community intervention that could be adapted to an 
individual’s environment and needs.

 Another underused approach to obesity management is to identify innovative strategies from 
‘positive outliers’. Positive outliers are defined as individuals who have succeeded where 
many others have not, to change their health behaviors, reduce their body mass index, and 
develop resilience in the context of adverse built and social environments.11,12 The premise 
of the positive outlier approach is that solutions to problems that face a community often 
exist among certain individuals within that community, and that these successful members 
possess strategies that can be generalized and promoted to improve the outcomes of others in 
the same community. Such individuals could help guide intervention development for other 
families in their same neighborhoods who have struggled with behavior change.
We designed the Connect for Health trial to leverage clinical and community resources to 
improve obesity and family-centered outcomes. The intervention was built upon practices of 
positive outlier families as well as strategies recommended by a diverse group of 
stakeholders representing parents, children, pediatricians, and community members.13,14 In 
this report, we summarize the main outcomes of Connect for Health.
METHODS
Study Overview
Connect for Health was conducted in 6 pediatric practices of Harvard Vanguard Medical 
Associates (HVMA), a multi-specialty group practice in Massachusetts. The study design, 
eligibility and recruitment have been previously described.15 We randomly assigned patients 
to one of 2 arms: (1) enhanced primary care or (2) enhanced primary care plus contextually-
tailored, individual health coaching. The enhanced primary care group served as the control 
arm even though these patients received some intervention previously incorporated into 
standard practice at HVMA. The primary outcomes included improvements in child BMI z-
score and family-centered outcomes. Study activities were approved by the Partners Health 
Care Institutional Review Board. The trial has been recorded in clinicaltrials.gov.
Eligibility and Recruitment
Eligibility included: 1) child age 2.0–12.9 years old, 2) BMI ≥ 85th percentile, and 3) family 
not planning to leave HVMA within the study time frame. Recruitment occurred from June 
2014 to March 2015; data collection ended March 2016. At visits with a child whose BMI 
was ≥ 85th percentile, clinicians received an alert in the electronic health record (EHR) with 
a link to refer the patient to the study. After receiving the referral, research assistants called 
parents to establish eligibility, obtain verbal consent, and complete a telephone survey. We 
then randomized participants and mailed an enrollment letter.
Randomization
We randomized participants using 6 separate randomization lists, one for each practice. We 
organized the lists into blocks of 4 to maintain balance between the two study arms and 
participants were randomized according to the order in which their consent was obtained. 
The lists were generated by the study biostatistician (EJO) and maintained by the study 
project manager (CH).

 Intervention
All pediatric clinicians received a computerized, clinical decision support (CDS) alert during 
primary care visits identifying children with a BMI ≥ 85th percentile, and two additional 
CDS tools to assist in management of children with overweight or obesity.15–17 Clinicians 
also gave parents a set of evidence-supported educational materials focusing on specified 
behavioral targets to support self-guided behavior change. 17The materials focused primarily 
on decreases in screen time and sugar-sweetened beverages; improving diet quality; 
increases in moderate and vigorous physical activity; and improvement in sleep duration and 
quality. Based on our qualitative work with positive outlier families and feedback from our 
Parent and Youth Advisory Board, we also developed materials to promote social-emotional 
wellness.
Enhanced Primary Care (Control)—Participants randomized to the enhanced primary 
care group were exposed to the clinical best practices described above. In addition, 
participants received monthly text messages that contained links to publically-available 
resources to support behavior change, e.g. links to the Let’s Move! program.18 Participants 
also received a Neighborhood Resource Guide listing places that support healthy living in 
their community.
Enhanced Primary Care + Coaching—In the enhanced primary care + coaching arm, 
families received individualized health coaching tailored to their socio-environmental 
context. Four trained health coaches contacted families every other month for 1 year using 
telephone, videoconference (using Vidyo®), or in-person visits, according to parent 
preference. These contacts were approximately 15–20-minutes. Details of the coaching 
training and quality assurance have been previously described.15 Families also received 
twice-weekly text messages or emails,19 and mailings following each coaching session with 
educational materials to support families’ behavior change goals.
Health coaches used a motivational interviewing style of counseling and shared decision-
making techniques20,21 to provide family-centered care in addressing childhood obesity risk 
factors and management. At each contact, health coaches used an online community 
resource map developed for the study22 to identify resources within each family’s 
community that could support behavior change. In addition, health coaches offered families 
a 1-month free family membership to area YMCAs to encourage physical activity and 
community connections. Families were also invited to attend a healthy grocery shopping 
program led by Cooking Matters®. To engage parents and children in setting behavior 
change goals, health coaches used a behavior change decision aid tool, developed by our 
study team that helped families identify outcomes that mattered most to them and potential 
motivators for engaging in behavior change.
Outcome Measures
We obtained height and weight from children’s EHR at baseline and at 1-year. In routine 
practice standardized across all sites, medical assistants measured children’s weight, without 
shoes, using electronic, calibrated scales, and height using a stadiometer. The primary 
outcome of age- and sex-specific BMI z-score was calculated on the basis of the 2000 CDC

 growth charts. In addition as a secondary outcome, we used CDC-defined cutoffs to 
categorize BMI as normal (≥ 5th percentile, < 85th percentile); overweight (≥ 85th 
percentile, < 95th percentile); obesity (95% percentile to < 120% of the 95th percentile); and 
severe obesity (≥ 120% of the 95th percentile)1,23
Parent-reported outcomes were assessed using telephone surveys at baseline and at 1-year. 
Parents reported their child’s health-related quality of life using the four subscales of the 
PedsQL-4.0. 24,25 We also assessed parental resource empowerment using the child weight 
management subscale of the Parent Resource Empowerment Scale.25 The five items in the 
scale assessed parents’ perceived knowledge of, ability to access, comfort accessing, 
knowledge of finding, and ability to acquire resources related to child weight management. 
Response options were: strongly disagree, disagree, agree, or strongly agree, worth 1 to 4 
points, respectively. Items were averaged to create a summary score (range= 1–4). 
Cronbach’s α was 0.87.26
Other Measures—Using surveys at baseline, we obtained child’s race/ethnicity, parent’s 
educational attainment and height and weight, and annual household income. At 1-year, we 
assessed the feasibility of the study and parents’ acceptance of and satisfaction with the 
intervention components. To assess unintended consequences we also asked parents if their 
participation in the program affected their satisfaction with their child’s health care services. 
To investigate prior trends in child BMI, we also obtained children’s height and weight 1 
year prior to the baseline study visit (pre-baseline) from the EHR.
Statistical Analysis
Distributions of participant characteristics across the 2 study arms were analyzed using t-test 
and chi-square tests and were found to be balanced at baseline. We performed multiple 
imputation using chained equations to impute missing outcomes for the 57 out of 721 
subjects (8%) who did not have BMI outcomes at 1 year follow up. In intent-to-treat 
analyses, we assessed the effect of the interventions on BMI z-score, PedsQL-4.0 summary 
score, and the parent resource empowerment score using linear mixed effects repeated 
measure models to account for clustering within participant over time. Participant baseline 
and 1 year measures were used as the outcome variables. Random intercepts were included 
in the models to account for correlation over time. The primary predictors were fixed effects 
for the intervention arm, time, and the time-by-intervention interaction term which 
determined whether there was greater improvement in the enhanced primary care + coaching 
group than the enhanced primary care group. Analogous ordinal logistic repeated measures 
models were used to model the effect of the intervention on the odds of being in a lower 
BMI category at follow-up compared to baseline. All models included indicator variables for 
clinical site. All models were implemented using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary 
NC).

 RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Clinicians referred 1752 children; we attempted to contact the parents of 1545 children to 
assess eligibility. We enrolled 721 children; 361 were randomized to the enhanced primary 
care group and 360 were assigned to the enhanced primary care + coaching group (Figure 
1). During the intervention period, one participant disenrolled from the enhanced primary 
care + coaching arm, citing insufficient time for the study activities. At 1 year, we obtained 
BMI from 664 children (92.0%) and surveys from 667 parents (92.5%). Table 1 shows the 
characteristics of the study sample. Baseline mean (SD) age was 8.0 (3.0) years; 35.0% were 
white, 33.3% black, 21.8% Hispanic, and 9.9% other; 45.4% lived in households with 
annual incomes < $50,000.
Body Mass Index Outcomes
Table 2 shows participants’ adjusted changes in BMI z-score and in being in a lower BMI 
category from baseline to 1-year follow-up. In the enhanced primary care group, adjusted 
mean (SD) BMI z-score was 1.91 (0.56) at baseline and 1.85 (0.58) at 1 year; an 
improvement of −0.06 BMI z-score units (95% CI: −0.10, −0.02). In the enhanced primary 
care + coaching group, adjusted mean (SD) BMI z-score was 1.87 (0.56) at baseline and 
1.79 (0.58) at 1 year; an improvement of −0.09 BMI z-score units (95% CI: −0.13, −0.05). 
Although we observed slightly more improvement in BMI z-score among the enhanced 
primary care + coaching group, there was no statistically significant difference between the 
two intervention arms (−0.02 units; p=0.39). These results reflect multiply-imputed data for 
children with missing 1-year follow up visits.
At 1-year, we found that 9.3% of children in the enhanced primary group and 11.6% of 
children in the enhanced primary care + coaching group no longer had a BMI in the 
overweight or obese range. Overall, we observed higher odds of being in a lower BMI 
category than they were at baseline in both the enhanced primary care group (OR: 1.18; 95% 
CI: 1.03, 1.35) and the enhanced primary care + coaching group (1.23; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.40).
We conducted post hoc analyses to examine whether our observations of improved BMI z-
score in both intervention arms could be explained by an underlying temporal trend towards 
improvement. This was not the case. Among 560 children with BMI z-scores available 1-
year prior to baseline (pre-baseline), at baseline, and at 1-year follow up, we found that BMI 
z-score was increasing in the year prior to enrollment in the enhanced primary care group 
(0.23 units; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.29) and the enhanced primary care + coaching group (0.16 
units; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.22) and then decreased in both groups in the year following 
enrollment (Figure 2).
Family-Centered Outcomes
Table 3 shows changes in participants’ health-related quality of life and parental resource 
empowerment during the intervention. Parents in the enhanced primary care + coaching 
group (1.53 units; 95% CI: 0.51, 2.56), but not in the enhanced care alone group (0.65 units; 
95% CI: −0.38, 1.67), reported significant improvements in their child’s health-related

 quality of life. Parental resource empowerment increased in both intervention arms (Table 
3). However, there were no statistically significant differences in either outcome between the 
two intervention arms.
Intervention Feasibility, Acceptability, and Unintended Consequences
Among participants in the enhanced primary care group, 91% of parents reported they 
received the study text messages and 53% were satisfied with their content. Approximately 
60% reported receiving the Neighborhood Resource Guide and of those, 66% reported being 
very satisfied with its content.
For the enhanced primary care + coaching group, 100% of participants reported receiving 
the study text messages and 72% were very satisfied with their content. Among the 360 
participants in the enhanced primary care + coaching group, 65% completed all 6 visits with 
a health coach; 96% reported receiving neighborhood resource information and 76% were 
very satisfied with the information. 81 parents (23%) reported joining their local YMCA and 
64 parents (18%) reported attending one of the Cooking Matters workshops.
Overall, 48% of participants in the enhanced primary care arm and 63% of participants in 
the enhanced primary care + health coaching arm reported that participation in Connect for 
Health increased their satisfaction with their child’s health care services. Only 7 (1.1%) 
participants reported their participation in the program decreased their satisfaction with their 
child’s health care services and there were no differences across study arms.
DISCUSSION
In this randomized trial we found that two interventions that delivered enhanced primary 
care and leveraged clinical and community resources for childhood obesity support resulted 
in modest improvements in child BMI z-score and greater resolution of elevated BMIs. 
However, while the magnitude of reduction in BMI z-score was higher in the intervention 
group that additionally received interactive, contextually-tailored health coaching, the 
difference compared to the group who were only exposed to enhanced care alone was not 
statistically significant. Both interventions led to improved family-centered outcomes. 
However, there were no statistically significant differences in either family-centered 
outcome between the two intervention groups. Overall, the intervention components were 
feasible to deliver, acceptable to parents, and did not have adverse effects on parent’s 
perceptions of their child’s health care services.
The Connect for Health study was designed with the hypothesis that the intervention group 
receiving both enhanced primary care and health coaching tailored to children’s community 
resources and social context would be more effective than the group receiving enhanced 
primary care alone. Yet, our findings did not support this hypothesis and there are several 
potential reasons. First, the enhanced primary care group was not a typical “usual care” 
control group. The practices where we delivered the study had already made several updates 
to their EHR to include clinical decision support tools and to provide families with 
educational materials for self-guided behavior change support. It would have been unethical 
to undo these practice changes once they were already established and after evidence

 supported their effectiveness in improving child BMI.17 Second, based on feedback from our 
Parent and Youth Advisory Board, we made the decision to add content on social and 
emotional wellness to existing parent educational materials and to provide passive 
information in the form of a booklet on neighborhood resources. Both of these 
enhancements could have further strengthened the effects of the control group on improving 
BMI. Third, it is possible that the number of contacts, frequency, or content of the health 
coaching provided in the enhanced primary care + coaching group was insufficient to 
produce greater effects than the enhanced primary care group alone.
While our findings did not support the original hypothesis of a greater intervention effect 
among the group that was individually coached, our findings do suggest that both 
intervention groups experienced improved BMI. Without a traditional control group our 
results could be attributed to temporal trends or regression to the mean. Post-hoc analyses of 
BMI changes prior to and after enrollment in the trial suggest, however, that the temporal 
trend was for BMI z-score to continue increasing after enrollment. Thus, our results are 
unlikely due to secular trends but regression towards the mean may still be a possibility.
The magnitudes of effect on BMI z-score in our study, e.g. −0.06 to −0.09 units, are similar 
and only modestly higher than those previously summarized (−0.04 units) in a meta-analysis 
of brief interventions in primary care.27 While these magnitudes of effect interrupted the 
increasing BMI trends in our population, questions remain about their clinical significance. 
There is currently a lack of direct evidence for any specific threshold for clinical 
significance.28 An expert panel has suggested that a BMI z-score reduction of 0.20 units is 
associated with clinically significant improvement.29 Other studies suggest that changes of 
0.15 BMI z-score units led to more healthful cardio-metabolic profiles.28 As suggested by a 
recent evidence review of childhood obesity management, regardless of what the threshold 
of clinical significance will be determined to be, simply arresting gain in excess BMI likely 
constitutes a clinically important benefit for many children.28
In addition to BMI, we examined family-centered outcomes of importance to parents and 
children. We found that parent-reported, child health-related quality of life improved by 1.53 
units among the enhanced primary care + coaching group and appeared to be driven by large 
improvements in the psychosocial score of the PedsQL; comparably higher than previous 
pediatric obesity trials.27 These effects were not greater than the enhanced primary care 
group. These findings suggest that the educational content delivered in both intervention 
arms related to social and emotional wellness including content on stress reduction, positive 
thinking, and bullying may have driven the observed improvements in child quality of life. 
Both interventions also improved parents’ perception of empowerment related to their 
child’s weight management – a novel, family-centered measure that has been shown to drive 
changes in food-, physical activity, and screen-related parenting among parents of children 
with obesity.30,31
As in any study, this one is subject to potential limitations. First, as previously described, our 
post-hoc analyses showing an increase in BMI z-score prior to intervention enrollment 
suggests either that we were successful in reversing an upward trend or that our results 
reflect regression to the mean. We are unable to rule out the possibility of the latter. Second,

 the study setting – a multi-site delivery system with a robust EHR – may not be 
representative of smaller pediatric practices in the US. However, as a relatively large medical 
group, HVMA is a typical primary care setting for many children, and meaningful use 
incentives are promoting increases in EHR adoption in both large and small pediatric 
practices.32 Thus the Connect for Health interventions are likely to generalize to more 
pediatric settings in the future. Third, our intervention did not decrease the percent of 
children with severe obesity. Previous studies have suggested that the magnitude of 
decreases in net daily energy intake necessary for children with severe obesity to achieve a 
healthy weight is considerably greater than the pediatric weight management that can be 
delivered in primary care based interventions such as Connect for Health.33,34 Our findings 
support the urgent recommendation for evidence-based, more aggressive weight 
management approaches for children with severe obesity.34
CONCLUSION
Two interventions that included a package of high-quality clinical care for obesity and 
linkages to community resources resulted in improved parent-reported outcomes for 
childhood obesity and improvements in child BMI. While individualized health coaching led 
to improvements in health-related quality of life, it did not have significantly greater effects 
on child BMI than enhanced primary care alone.
