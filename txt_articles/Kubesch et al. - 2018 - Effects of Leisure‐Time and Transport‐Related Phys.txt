Background-—Physical activity enhances the uptake of air pollutants, possibly reducing its beneficial effects. We examined the
effects of leisure-time and transport-related physical activities on the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), and whether potential
benefits on MI are reduced by exposure to traffic-related air pollution.
Methods and Results-—A group of 57 053 participants (50–65 years of age) from the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort
reported physical activity at baseline (1993–1997) and were linked to registry data on hospital contacts and out-of-hospital deaths
caused by MI, until December 2015. Nitrogen dioxide levels were estimated at participants’ baseline residences. We used Cox
regressions to associate participation in sports, cycling, walking, and gardening with incident and recurrent MI, and tested for
interaction by nitrogen dioxide. Of 50 635 participants without MI at baseline, 2936 developed incident MI, and of 1233
participants with MI before baseline, 324 had recurring MI during follow-up. Mean nitrogen dioxide concentration was 18.7 lg/m3
at baseline (1993–1997). We found inverse statistically significant associations between participation in sports (hazard ratio; 95%
confidence interval: 0.85; 0.79–0.92), cycling (0.91; 0.84–0.98), gardening (0.87; 0.80–0.95), and incident MI, while the
association with walking was statistically nonsignificant (0.95; 0.83–1.08). Recurrent MI was statistically nonsignificantly inversely
associated with cycling (0.80; 0.63–1.02), walking (0.82, 0.57–1.16), and gardening (0.91; 0.71–1.18), and positively with sports
(1.06; 0.83–1.35). There was no effect modification of the associations between physical activity and MI by nitrogen dioxide.
Conclusions-—Benefits of physical activity on both the incidence and the recurrence of MI are not reduced by exposure to high
levels of air pollution. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e009554. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.009554.)

 participants showed that active commuting involving walking
and cycling was associated with an overall 11% reduction in
CVD risk.4 Furthermore, exercise as a part of cardiac
rehabilitation is a key component for secondary prevention
of CVD and the recurrence of MI.5,6 Physical activity can
improve strength and cardiovascular fitness and induce
beneficial changes in cardiometabolic risk factors that are
independent of mere body weight reduction.7 Mechanisms by
which physical activity decreases the risk of CVD involve
favorable changes in inflammatory status, hemostatic factors,
insulin sensitivity, body fat, blood lipids and viscosity, blood
pressure, coronary blood flow, decreases in myocardial
oxygen demand and in adrenergic activity, and increases in
vagal tone.8–10 Furthermore, physical activities often go along
with a favorable change of plasma vitamin D concentrations,
which could be explained by higher sun exposure while
exercising outdoors.
Outdoor air pollution is a major global risk factor for CVD.
In 2015, it was estimated that exposure to air pollution, in
terms of fine particulate matter, was responsible for 4.2 mil-
lion deaths, representing 7.6% of total global deaths, with a
majority of them caused by cardio- and cerebrovascular
disease.11 Exposure to outdoor air pollution is an established
risk factor for CVD morbidity and mortality, including MI.12–14
Inflammation and oxidative stress are suggested as principal
underlying mechanisms for the detrimental effects of air
pollution on the cardiovascular system.15,16
Physical activity increases the air pollution intake by
increasing the inhaled dose of air pollutants because of the
exercise-induced higher minute ventilation, and a higher
deposition of the inhaled particles in the lungs.17 Only a few
studies examined whether exposure to air pollution during
exercise attenuates the beneficial effects of physical activity
on CVD.
Findings from the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort
study of 52 000 participants showed that physical activity, in
terms of cycling, gardening, and participation in sports, was
associated with a 16% to 22% lower risk of all-cause and 18%
to 22% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality, regardless of the
nitrogen dioxide (NO2; a surrogate for traffic-related air
pollution) levels at the participants’ residences.18 Kubesch
et al examined the interplay between physical activity and
traffic-related air pollution in a crossover experimental study
in 28 healthy participants in 4 exposure scenarios and found
that cycling decreased systolic blood pressure despite high
air-pollution exposure levels. On the other hand, the pollutant-
associated increase in diastolic blood pressure was not
attenuated after cycling.19 Another recent experimental study
in 119 healthy patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and CVD compared the cardiopulmonary responses to
walking in a traffic-polluted versus a recreational less-polluted
area and concluded that the short-term exposure to air
pollution inhibits the beneficial cardiopulmonary effects of
physical activity.20
It therefore remains unclear whether beneficial effects of
the physical activities on the cardiovascular system are
reduced by exposure to traffic-related air pollution, and if so,
under which conditions. To date no study has evaluated
whether benefits of physical activities on incident and
recurrent MI are modified by exposure to air pollution.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of leisure-
time and transport-related physical activities on the risk of
incident and recurrent MI in middle-aged men and women,
and to examine whether these effects were modified by
residential exposure to traffic-related air pollution.
Methods
Study Population
We used data from the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort
with available information on physical activity and relevant
confounders for MI. Between 1993 and 1997, a total of
160 725 people, 50 to 64 years of age, born in Denmark,
living in Copenhagen or Aarhus, and free of cancer, were
invited to participate in the cohort study. A total of 57 053
men (48%) and women (52%) were recruited.21 The partici-
pants completed an extensive questionnaire on physical
activity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, education,
occupation, history of diseases and medication, reproductive
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The long-term benefits of physical activity in preventing
development of myocardial infarction (MI) outweigh the
risks associated with exposure to air pollution.
• Physical activity can reduce the risk of MI, even at moderate
intensity levels.
• Both leisure- and transport-related physical activities reduce
the risk of both incident MI and the risk of MI recurrence in
patients with MI history.
• Exposure to traffic-related air pollution increases the risk of
both incident and recurrent MI.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Benefits of physical activity in reducing the risk of incident
and recurrent MI are not reduced by exposure to air
pollution, in cities with air pollution levels similar to
Copenhagen.

and weight were measured at the enrollment. Relevant Danish
ethics committees and data protection agencies approved the
study, and all participants provided written informed consent.

material from the Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort may be

and Health cohort.
Physical Activity Definition
In the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort, physical
activities information was collected by a self-administered,
interviewer-checked questionnaire in which leisure-time and
utilitarian (traveling to and from work, shopping, etc) physical
activities were reported as hours per week (h/wk) spent on
sports (exemplified as gymnastics, running, swimming, and
badminton), cycling, gardening, walking, housework, and “do-
it-yourself” activities. Information was collected separately for
winter and summer of the previous year, and the 2 values
were averaged, so that being active implies at least half an
hour per week spent on a specific activity.
The validity of the physical activity–related items of the
questionnaire used in this cohort was assessed in studies
finding a high correlation between self-reported physical
activity estimates with the accelerometer measurements of
total metabolic equivalent in 182 participants22 and with
combined heart rate and movement-sensing measurements in
1941 participants.23
We focused on cycling, gardening, and walking, which are
relevant for outdoor physical activities habitually taking place
under exposure to outdoor air pollution in Denmark, as well as
participation in sports, which could include both indoor and
outdoor activities. Furthermore, the participants reported
their level of physical activities at work at the time of
enrollment defined as sedentary, standing, light, or heavy.22
NO2 Exposure Estimation
The concentrations of the traffic-related pollutant NO2 were
estimated for the residential addresses of cohort participants
using the Danish AirGIS dispersion modeling system.24 AirGIS
is based on a geographical information system, and provides
estimates of traffic-related air pollution with temporal (1-year
averages) and spatial (address-level) resolution, which have
been validated, because a high correlation was found between
AirGIS-estimated and measured NO2 values.25,26 The correla-
tions between modeled and measured NO2 concentrations at
204 locations in Copenhagen (1994–1995),25 and in a busy
street in Copenhagen (1995–2006),26 were high (r=0.90 and
0.67, respectively). AirGIS has been used in earlier studies in
this cohort, reporting associations of NO2 with asthma and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,27 incident MI,28 and
overall and cause-specific mortality.18
We used the annual mean concentrations of NO2 at
residential addresses of each cohort participant as a proxy of
average exposure to traffic-related air pollution in general, and
during exercise. The mean NO2 concentrations correspond to
each participant’s recruitment year and therewith to the same
year for which participants reported physical activities. We
defined an indicator of low (lower 25th percentile of exposure
range: <14.3 lg/m3), medium (≥14.3–21.0 lg/m3), and high
(upper 25th percentile of exposure range: ≥21.0 lg/m3)
exposure to NO2.
Outcome Definition
Using the unique personal identification numbers, we linked
the cohort data to the Central Population Registry29 to obtain
vital status data (death and emigration date), and the Danish
National Patient Register,30 to identify hospital contacts
(emergency, outpatient, or inpatient) since 1978 using
primary discharge diagnoses for MI according the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10): code
I21.31 In addition, we linked the cohort data to the Danish
Cause of Death register to include out-of-hospital deaths
caused by MI, for those who did not have a record of hospital
contact in the Danish National Patient Register. In addition,
we checked our data set for primary discharge diagnosis for
codes I22 and I23 (reinfarctions and acute complications
related to a MI that occurred up to 28 days before) in order to
identify potentially unregistered MI cases, and we did not find
any additional MI cases.
Incident MI was defined as the date of first hospital contact
or out-of-hospital death caused by MI between the cohort
baseline and before December 31, 2015 in participants who
did not have a hospital contact for MI before cohort baseline.
In participants who had hospital contact for MI before
baseline, MI recurrence was defined as first hospital contact
for MI or out-of-hospital death caused by MI after cohort
baseline and before December 31, 2015.
Statistical Analysis
We used Cox proportional hazards regression model with age
as underlying time scale to examine the associations between
the physical activities/NO2 with MI (incident and recurrent) in
separate models. The follow-up started on the date of

 recruitment into the cohort (1993–1997) and ended at the
date of first MI or first MI recurrence, date of emigration or
death, or December 31, 2015, whichever came first.
First, we estimated the associations between MI (incident
and recurrent) and participation in the different types of
physical activities as a dichotomous variable (yes/no) in a
crude model adjusted for age only (underlying time scale)
and mutually for the other 3 physical activities. Second, we
fit a fully adjusted model adjusting additionally for sex,
occupational physical activity, diet (fruit, vegetable, fat, and
fish intake), alcohol consumption, smoking (status, intensity,
and duration), environmental tobacco smoke, marital status,
education,
and

therapy
use
(as
defined in Table 1). Next, we evaluated the effect of time
spent on each of the physical activities, the total time of all
4 physical activities for each participant, and the total time
spent on outdoor physical activities (cycling, walking, and
gardening) (0.5–4 and >4 h/wk compared with <0.5 h/wk,
respectively).
We tested for effect modification of the associations
between the 4 physical activities (yes/no) and incident and
recurrent MI by exposure to NO2 (low/medium/high) by
introducing an interaction term into the model and using
likelihood ratio tests. In addition, we performed an analysis
stratified for the NO2 concentrations (low/medium/high).
Furthermore, we estimated the associations between incident
and recurrent MI with NO2, and we performed models
assessing the associations between physical activities and
MI under mutual adjustment for NO2 exposure to provide
additional
information
on
potential
effect
modification
between the 2 factors (results shown in Table S1).
As an additional analysis, we fitted a model adjusting
additionally for body mass index, hypertension, hypercholes-
terolemia, diabetes mellitus, and stroke, which are potential
biological mediators of the association between physical
activities and MI (results shown in Table S2). Results are
presented as hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals,
estimated with “stcox” using Stata 14 (StataCORP LP, TX).
Results
Cohort Characteristics
Of 57 053 cohort participants, 582 were excluded because of
cancer diagnosis before baseline, 4410 because of missing
NO2 exposure assessment data or missing residential address
at recruitment, and 193 because of missing information on
potential confounder or effect modifier data, leaving 51 868
cohort participants for the study. Of these, 3260 incident or
recurrent MI events (6.3%; 918 708 person years) were
documented during a mean follow-up of 17.7 years between
baseline (1993–1997) and December 31, 2015. Of 50 635
(97.6%) participants who did not have a history of MI at study
baseline, 2936 participants developed incident MI during a
mean follow-up of 17.8 years (902 192 person-years). Of
1233 (2.4%) participants with a history of MI before baseline,
324 had a recurrent MI during a mean follow-up of 14.4 years
(16 515.88 person-years) (Table 1).
Mean age at baseline was 56.7 years, and 52.2% of the
study participants were women. The mean body mass index
was 26.0 kg/m2 in the total cohort, and 27.1 kg/m2 in
participants who developed a MI. The majority (99.2%) of the
study participants reported being involved in 1 of the 4
physical activities. Of all participants, 54% participated in
sports, 68% cycled, 74% gardened, and 93% walked (Table 1).
Cohort members who participated in physical activities spent
on average 2.4 h/wk participating in sports, 3.2 h/wk
cycling, 3.0 h/wk gardening, and 4.3 h/wk walking. Cohort
participants who developed MI (incident or recurrent MI)
during follow-up were slightly less physically active (98.6%; all
4 physical activities combined) than those who did not
develop a MI (99.2%) (data not shown).
The mean concentration of NO2 at residence was 18.7 lg/m3
in the total cohort and 18.9 lg/m3 in participants who
developed a MI (incident or recurrent) during follow-up
(Table 1). In this cohort, the cycling and walking levels at
baseline were comparable for participants residing in areas
with low (65%; 92%), medium (70%; 93%), and high (68%; 94%)
NO2 levels. In contrast, gardening was more common in
participants living in areas with low NO2 (85%) than in those in
areas with medium (76%) and high (57%) NO2 concentrations
(data not shown).
Associations Between Physical Activities and MI
The crude model analysis showed a statistically significant
inverse association with participation (yes/no) in sports
(0.67; 0.63–0.73), cycling (0.84; 0.78–0.91), and walking
(0.84; 0.74–0.96) with incident MI. These associations
became weaker for sports (0.85; 0.79–0.92) and cycling
(0.91; 0.84–0.98) in the fully adjusted model, while the
inverse association between gardening and incident MI was
strengthened (0.87; 0.80–0.95) (Table 2). Among partici-
pants with a history of MI at baseline, the crude (0.79; 0.63–
0.99) and the fully adjusted analysis (0.80; 0.63–1.01) show
an inverse association between cycling and recurrent MI, the
latter without reaching statistical significance. We found
statistically
nonsignificant
inverse
associations
between
walking (0.82, 0.57–1.16) and gardening (0.91; 0.71–1.18)
with recurrent MI, and a statistically nonsignificant positive
association with participation in sports (1.06; 0.83–1.35)
(Table 2). The inclusion of body mass index and comorbidi-
ties, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus in the fully
adjusted model, attenuated weakly the hazard ratios for the

 associations between physical activities and incident and
recurrent MI (Table S2).
Association Between the Time Spent With
Physical Activities and MI
In participants without a history of MI at baseline, the
participation in sports 0.5 to 4 and >4 h/wk reduced the risk
for incident MI by 14% and 18%, respectively (0.86; 0.79–
0.93, and 0.82; 0.70–0.96), compared with no participation in
sports (<0.5 h/wk). Cycling for >4 h/wk was inversely
associated with incident MI (0.86; 0.77–0.97) as compared
with cycling <0.5 h/wk. We found an inverse association with
gardening 0.5 to 4 h/wk (0.87; 0.79–0.95) and >4 h/wk
(0.89; 0.79–0.95), compared with gardening <0.5 h/wk. In
participants with MI history at baseline, we found an inverse
association with cycling 0.5 to 4 h/wk (0.69; 0.53–0.89) as
compared with cycling <0.5 h/wk, showing a 31% risk
reduction of recurrent MI. The combined analysis of the 4
physical activities and recurrent MI showed an inverse
association with 0.5 to 4 h/wk (0.47; 0.24–0.89) and
>4 h/wk (0.42; 0.23–0.78), compared with <0.5 h/wk
participation in all 4 activities combined. More than 4 h/wk
participation in outdoor physical activities (cycling, walking,
and gardening combined) was inversely associated (0.50;
0.28–0.88) with recurrent MI, compared with <0.5 h/wk
participation in outdoor activities combined (Table 3).
Association Between NO2 and MI
As compared with residing in areas with low NO2 (<14.3 lg/m3),
residing in areas with high NO2 concentrations (>20.9 lg/m3)
was positively associated with incident MI in both the crude
(1.19; 1.07–1.32) and the fully adjusted (1.17; 1.05–1.30)
analysis. In participants with history of MI at baseline, residing
in areas with high NO2 levels was positively associated with
the risk of recurrent MI in the fully adjusted analyses (1.39;
1.01–1.93) (Table S3).
Interaction Between Physical Activities and NO2
We found no statistically significant effect modification of the
associationbetween incidentorrecurrentMIwithparticipationin
physical activities by residential NO2 at the time of enrollment in
the study (Table 4). In addition, the effects of physical activities
were independent of NO2 in the adjusted model (Table S1).
The analysis stratified by different levels of residential NO2
exposure showed inverse associations between sport and
incident MI in medium and high residential NO2 exposure

 intensity levels. We found that all physical activities (sports,
cycling, and gardening) with the exception of walking were
associated with a significantly reduced (9%–15%) risk of
incident MI. In patients with MI, with the exception of sports,
all physical activities (cycling, walking, and gardening) were
nonstatistically significantly associated with a 9% to 20%
reduction in risk of recurrent MI. We found statistically
significant associations with moderate (0.5–4 h/wk) cycling,
reducing the risk of recurrent MI by 31%, a 58% reduction for
>4 h/wk participation in all physical activities combined, and
50% for outdoor physical activities only, all compared with no
participation in physical activities. Exposure to traffic-related
air pollution, assessed as NO2 at the participants’ residences,
was associated with increased risk of both incident MI and
recurrent MI. We present a novel finding of no effect
modification of the association between physical activities
and MI by residential NO2.
Effects of Physical Activities on MI Incidence and
Recurrence
We found a 15% lower rate of incident MI hospital contacts in
cohort members who participated in sports and 9% risk
reduction associated with cycling. These results are in
agreement with recent studies reporting an 8% to 35% lower
risk of MI associated with physical activities.4,9,32,33
Generally, we did not find a dose–response relationship
between time spent on physical activities and incident MI
or recurrent MI. A Swedish study showed a 31% reduced
risk for incident MI associated with high versus low leisure-
time physical activities.34 Earlier studies with data on high-
and moderate-intensity exercise among CVD patients found
that both intensity levels decreased CVD risk, but also
pointed to the knowledge gap regarding the right intensity
and amount of physical activity in secondary prevention of
CVD.35–37
We primarily compare the participation in physical activ-
ities with no participation in physical activities (<0.5 h/wk),
which also involves sedentary participants. Generally, in a
comparison with a sedentary population, it should be
considered that sedentary or close to sedentary participants
are more likely to be a particular group with potentially lower
health status or a generally less healthy lifestyle, which may
lead to an overestimation of the health-promoting effects of
physical inactivity if not taken into account.38
Interaction Between Physical Activities and NO2
Our results complement recent findings by Roswall et al in
this cohort, showing that long-term exposure to NO2 was
associated with increased risk of incident MI.28 We found that
high (>20.9 lg/m3) as compared with low (<14.3 lg/m3)
residential NO2 exposure was associated with 17% increased
risk of incident MI, in agreement with Roswall et al, and 39%
increased risk for recurrent MI, which is a novel finding. The
findings in this cohort agree with previous evidence showing
that exposure to outdoor air pollution increases risk of CVD
morbidity and mortality.12–14,39

 There was no evidence of modification of the associations
between physical activities and incident or recurrent MI by
NO2 at residence (Table 4). This table also shows that the risk
of MI increased with increasing levels of NO2, in participants
who were not physically active, while the benefits of physical
activity remained in all 3 NO2 level groups (Table 4). Similar
patterns were observed in the stratified analyses (Table 5),
which showed that physical activity reduced the incident MI
risk in all 3 groups of NO2 (low/medium/high), while in
participants with a history of MI, the risk for MI recurrence
was inversely associated with some (sports, gardening, and
walking), but not all physical activities. In high residential NO2
concentrations, only cycling was strongly protective. This may
suggest an increased susceptibility of patients with MI (in
contrast to participants without MI history) to the exposure to
traffic-related air pollution during physical activity. However,
these results need to be interpreted with caution, because of
the small number of cases and inconsistent results across
different activities in the group of participants with a history of
MI.

Physical Activity, Air Pollution, and MI
Kubesch et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 4, 2019
 Our finding of a long-term, preventive effect of physical
activities on CVD morbidity and mortality, independent from the
exposure to traffic-related air pollution, complements recent
results by Kubesch et al, who, in an human experimental study
of the interaction between short-term exposure to traffic-related
air pollution and physical activity in Barcelona, Spain, found no
evidence of interaction with NOX (a generic term for nitrogen
oxides relevant for traffic-related air pollution), and furthermore,
confirmed that cycling both in locations with high and low traffic-
related air pollution lowered systolic blood pressure, albeit to a
lesser extent after high traffic-related air pollution exposure.19
The authors also found that the pollutant-associated diastolic
blood pressure increases were not attenuated by physical
activity. Sinharay et al showed reduced beneficial changes in
indices of arterial stiffness in healthy and ischemic heart disease
participants after walking in streets with high compared with low
concentrations of traffic-related air pollution.20 However, the air
pollution exposures in the above experimental studies taking
place in Barcelona and London were substantially higher levels
than those in our study. Finally, the results of our study
corroborate recent findings from this cohort on beneficial long-
term effects of physical activities in reducing risk of premature
overall and CVD mortality, in areas with low and high levels of
traffic-related air pollution in Denmark.18
Strengths and Limitations
The main strength of our study includes the use of the
objective definition of MI incidence and recurrence based on
the hospital contact data from the Danish National Patient
Register, a nationwide validated register31 of routinely
collected data on all hospital contacts in Denmark since
1978, with no loss to follow-up, as well as MI-related out-of-
hospital deaths from the Danish Cause of Death Register.
Validation studies of MI diagnoses from the Danish National
Patient Register, as compared with medical records and
discharge summaries, found high validity and positive predic-
tive value between 90% and 100%.31 Furthermore, we
benefited from the large prospective cohort with well-defined
data on MI-related confounders and physical activity. Our data
on physical activities included differentiated information on
the physical activities level at work that we could adjust for in
our analysis. Another major strength of this study is the
setting in 2 urban areas in Denmark, where prevalence of
cycling was high (68%), and includes both leisure and
utilitarian cycling. Moreover, information and differential bias
in relation to exposure can be considered minimal in this
study, since MI events, vital status, and information on
residential addresses used for modeling NO2 exposure
concentrations are obtained objectively from reliable popula-
tion registers.
A weakness of the study is the long follow-up time without
updated information, neither on the participants’ residences
and therewith on changes in their residential NO2 exposures,
nor on changes of participants’ physical activity habits or risk
factors for MI, which might have changed from the time of
reporting at enrollment in the study. Another weakness of the
study is the use of NO2 levels at baseline residence as a proxy

Physical Activity, Air Pollution, and MI

 of traffic-related air pollution level exposure during the
investigated physical activities. This proxy is probably rea-
sonable for gardening, which is assumed to take place at the
baseline residence, where NO2 levels are modeled, but less
reasonable for walking, cycling, and sports. The exact location
where physical activities took place is not known, and
resulting exposure misclassification of the investigated effect
modifier may explain lack of interaction between physical
activities and NO2 in this study. Moreover, we used NO2 as a
proxy for traffic-related air pollution since there is a lack of
data on other pollutants. The exposure to particulate matter,
ozone, and carbon monoxide while exercising was previously
discussed as a risk factor, especially in patients with CVD.40
Although NO2 is a good proxy of traffic-related air pollution,
the results of this study for NO2 cannot be generalized to
other pollutants, and more data with particulate matter and
ozone are needed. Furthermore, we assume potential air
pollution exposure misclassification because of different
levels of exposure between work and residential NO2
exposure concentrations. Generally, people spent a consider-
able time of their life at work away from their residences. The
NO2 exposures at the participants’ work addresses potentially
differ from the concentration we estimated for the residences
of our cohort participants. In this cohort, only �21% of the
participants reported being unemployed and therefore, the
real NO2 exposures of the major part of our cohort
participants may vary from the estimated NO2 exposure.
However, considering the age of the cohort participants at
recruitment (50–65 years), several of whom retired during
follow-up, we can assume that walking and cycling occurred in
close proximity to their residences.
Physical activity “dose” is a combination of the duration,
intensity, and frequency of activity.41 We lacked detailed
information on physical activities intensities, which is a
weakness of this study when it comes to the development of
strategies concerning the appropriate dose of physical
activities for the prevention of incident, and in particular for
the prevention of MI recurrence. Furthermore, the nonspecific
nature of participation in sports is variable, and whether it
pertained to indoor or outdoor activity limits our results. Also,
we lacked data on the health history status of participants
with MI before baseline and cannot distinguish MI patients by
disease severity. For that reason, we cannot determine
whether physical activities are generally beneficial for all
patients with MI regardless of their health impairment or only
for those with less severe health impairment after MI.
Another weakness of the study is the possibility that the
nonsignificant interaction between NO2 and physical activity
was explained by the reverse association between air
pollution and physical activity, meaning that people chose
not to participate in physical activity on days with higher
levels of air pollution.42,43
Finally, we cannot exclude some degree of potential
reverse causality, meaning that cohort participants with some
kind of unrecognized or recognized health condition at
baseline were already less engaged in physical activities
because of their condition. Also, we cannot exclude an
overestimation of the benefits of the physical activities
presented in this cohort, since participants of the Diet,
Cancer, and Health cohort were potentially healthier than the
general Danish population, because of their better education
and higher income than nonparticipants.22
Our results add new evidence to the literature on the
protective effect of physical activities and the time spent on
these activities on MI incidence and recurrence. Our results
support that physical activity, even at low and moderate
levels, and even outdoor activities such as cycling and
gardening, are effective in the prevention of MI among middle-
aged women and men. Our finding that long-term benefits of
physical activities on MI incidence and recurrence are not
statistically significantly modified by exposure to higher levels
of NO2 is novel. Our results strengthen and complement a
growing number of health impact assessment studies,
supporting the evidence that health benefits because of
increased physical activities levels generally outweigh the
risks related to increases in inhaled air pollution doses during
physical activity.44 However, given the limitations of our
study, we cannot exclude potentially higher net effects of
physical activities, when predominantly performed in low air
pollution. We therefore recommend, particularly to the more
susceptible
populations,
eluding
increased
air
pollutant
uptake by simple measures such as avoiding active commut-
ing or exercising along busy main roads, and instead to
choose alternative less polluted side roads, parks and green
areas, etc.
Conclusion
We found that physical activity has preventive effects on both
the incidence and the recurrence of MI. The beneficial effects
of physical activities on incident and recurrent MI are
independent of the exposure to NO2, and are not reduced in
those living in areas with high residential NO2 levels. Thus, we
can conclude that the long-term benefits of physical activity in
preventing the development of MI in healthy, middle-aged
participants, and possibly as effective disease control in
patients with prior MI, can outweigh the risks associated with
enhanced residential exposure to traffic-related air pollution
during physical activity.
