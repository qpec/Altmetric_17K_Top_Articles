Abstract
Objective: Consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), a major component
of the Mediterranean diet, has been associated with reduced incidence of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanisms involved in this protective
action remain to be fully elucidated. Methods: Herein, we investigated the effect
of daily consumption of EVOO on the AD-like phenotype of a mouse mode of
the disease with plaques and tangles. Results: Triple transgenic mice (3xTg)
received either regular chow or a chow diet supplemented with EVOO starting
at 6 months of age for 6 months, then assessed for the effect of the diet on the
AD-like neuropathology and behavioral changes. Compared with controls, mice
receiving the EVOO-rich diet had an amelioration of their behavioral deficits,
and a significant increase in the steady state levels of synaptophysin, a protein
marker of synaptic integrity. In addition, they had a significant reduction in
insoluble Ab peptide levels and deposition, lower amount of phosphorylated
tau protein at specific epitopes, which were secondary to an activation of cell
autophagy. Interpretation: Taken together, our findings support a beneficial
effect of EVOO consumption on all major features of the AD phenotype (be-
havioral deficits, synaptic pathology, Ab and tau neuropathology), and demon-
strate that autophagy activation is the mechanism underlying these biological
actions.
Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible, age-associated
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive
memory loss and cognitive decline, and the leading cause
of dementia accounting for 5 million cases in the US and
44 million cases worldwide. In 2015, AD cost was over
200 billion dollars in the US alone, and over 600 billion
dollars worldwide.1 Only approximately 5% of the total
AD cases are due to genetic mutations responsible for
abnormal Amyloid-beta (Ab) elevation and deposition in
the brain. However, the etiology for the sporadic form of
AD accounting for 95% of the remaining cases is still
unknown, and so far no effective therapy is available.2 As
result, in recent years the AD research field has moved
more and more toward prevention and away from treat-
ment. Today, we know that delaying the onset of AD by
even 1 year could significantly reduce new diagnosed
cases, and that implementing efficient preventative mea-
sures could ultimately result in significant annual savings
for the skyrocketing costs related to the disease world-
wide.3 For this reason, it is extremely important to iden-
tify new targets and tools that by acting as preventative
strategies could potentially offer novel therapeutic oppor-
tunities with the capacity not only to prevent but also
halt the disease progression.
Epidemiological and clinical studies have consistently
indicated that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet
is associated with a reduced risk of developing mild cogni-
tive impairment and AD, and a reduced risk of progressing
from mild cognitive impairment to AD.4,5 Among the dif-
ferent nutrients that characterize the Mediterranean diet, a
lot of attention has been focused on the extra-virgin olive
oil (EVOO) daily intake, which is estimated to be quite
high in the Mediterranean area populations compared with
other geographical regions around the world.6,7

 Previous studies have shown that consumption of
EVOO results in amelioration of learning and memory in
SAMP8 mice, and a reversal of age-related dysfunctions
in old mice.8–10 In both cases, the authors attributed
those beneficial effects to the EVOO phenolic compounds
and their antioxidant ability to protect against the dis-
ease-related and age-associated brain oxidation of these
animals.8–10 More recently, it was shown that EVOO
administration to a transgenic mouse model of AD-like
brain amyloidosis, TgSwDI, reduces parenchymal and vas-
cular Ab levels via an enhancement of its clearance.11
However, because this mouse model manifests only
one of the two main aspects of the AD phenotype, the
effect of EVOO on tau neuropathology remains to be
fully investigated. With this goal in mind, in the present
paper we evaluated the biological effect of EVOO in the
triple transgenic
mice (3xTg), which are known to
develop
both
amyloid
plaques
and
neurofibrillary
tangles.12
Methods and Materials
Animals and treatment
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Usage Committee, in accordance with
the US National Institutes of Health guidelines. The 3xTg
mice harboring 3 transgenes (PS1 M146V, tau P301L, and
APPSwe) were used in this study.12 Animals were kept in
a pathogen-free environment, on a 12-h light/dark cycle
and fed a normal chow and water ad libitum. Male and
female mice were used throughout the studies. Starting at
6 months of age, mice were randomized into two groups:
one fed with standard diet (CTR, n = 12), the other with
EVOO-enriched diet (EVOO, n = 10) for 6 months. The
EVOO was from the olive growing area of Apulia region
(Torremaggiore, Foggia, Italy). Olive fruits from the cul-
tivar “Peranzana” were processed immediately after har-
vesting and EVOO obtained by crushing the olives under
mechanical cold pressure to preserve all the nutritional
components, and meet the stringent criteria of the pre-
mium quality level (free acid content < 0.3 g%, peroxide
value < 7 mEq/Kg, K232 < 1.85). Fresh diet was pro-
vided every other day. During the treatment, body weight
of the animals was measured every 30 days to ascertain
that the EVOO diet did not affect caloric intake. Mice
underwent the same behavioral tests at 6 (for baseline
assessment), 9 (3 months treatment) and 12 months
(6 months treatment) of age as described below and then
euthanized at the last time point. After perfusion brains
were removed, gently rinsed in cold 0.9% phosphate-buf-
fered saline and immediately dissected in two halves. One
half was immediately stored at �80°C for biochemistry;
the other half was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phos-
phate-buffered saline, pH7.4 for immunohistochemistry
studies.
Behavioral tests
All the animals were handled for at least 3–4 consecutive
days before testing and all tests were conducted by an
experimenter unaware of the treatment.
Y-maze
The Y-maze apparatus consisted of 3 arms, 32 cm (long)
610 cm (wide) with 26-cm walls (San Diego Instruments,
San Diego, CA). As previously described13,14, testing was
always performed in the same room and at the same time
to
ensure
environmental
consistency
as
previously
described. After introduction to the center of the Y-maze,
the animal is allowed to freely explore the three arms for
5 min and the sequence and total number of arms
entered was video-recorded in order to calculate the per-
centage of alternation. Any entry into an arm was consid-
ered
valid
if
all
limbs
were
within
the
arm.
An
alternation was defined as three consecutive entries in
three different arms (1,2,3 or 2,3,1, etc.). The percentage
alternation score was calculated using the following for-
mula:
total
alternation
number/total
number
of
entries�2) 9 100.
Fear conditioning
The fear conditioning test was performed in a condition-
ing chamber (19 9 25 9 19 cm) equipped with black
methacrylate walls, transparent front door, a speaker, and
grid floor (Start Fear System; Harvard Apparatus) as pre-
viously described.13 During the first day of the test, mice
were placed into the conditioning chamber and allowed
free exploration for 2 min in the white noise (65 dB)
before the delivery of the conditioned stimulus (CS) tone
(30 sec,
90 Db,
2000 Hz)
paired
with
a
foot-
shock unconditioned stimulus (2 sec, 0.6 mA) through a
grid floor at the end of the tone. In the training phase,
each mouse received a total of three CS tones paired with
a 30-sec inter trial interval. At the end of the training
phase, the mouse was removed from the chamber and
placed back in its home cage. 24 h after, in the contextual
fear conditioning stage, the animal was returned to the
same environment for 5 min in the presence of white
noise only (65 dB). The animal’s freezing responses to the
environmental context were recorded. The cue fear condi-
tioning stage started 2 h after the contextual stage. The
animal was placed back into the chamber after providing
different contextual cues, such as white wall, smooth

 metal floor, lemon extract drops, and red light condition.
After 3 min of free exploration, the mouse was exposed
to the exactly same 3 CS tones with 30 sec inter trial
interval in the training stage without the foot-shock. The
freezing score for each mouse was recorded.
Morris water maze
The apparatus used to perform the Morris water maze
task consists of a large circular pool (122 cm in diameter)
with walls 76 cm high, which is filled with water main-
tained at 22°�2°C, and made opaque by the addition of
a nontoxic white paint. Mice were given four daily trials
for four consecutive days. Animals were trained to swim
to a submerged Plexiglas platform starting each time from
different positions. If they fail to find the platform within
60 sec, they were manually guided to the platform and
allowed to remain there for 15 sec. Mice were trained to
reach the hidden platform within 20 sec (escape laten-
cy).On the fifth day, during the probe, mice were allowed
to swim in the pool without the platform for 60 sec, and
the number of entries in the platform zone and the time
spent in the different quadrants were recorded. During
subsequent trials the swimming speed was also deter-
mined.14
Immunoblot analyses
Immunoblot
analyses
were
performed
as
previously
described15,16. Briefly, proteins were extracted in enzyme
immunoassay buffer containing 250 mmol/L Tris base,
750 mmol/L NaCl, 5% NP-40, 25 mmol/L EDTA, 2.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and
an EDTA-free protease and phosphatase inhibitors cock-
tail tablet (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN,
USA), sonicated, centrifuged at 56,700 g for 45 min at
4°C, and supernatants used for immunoblot analysis, as
previously described. Total protein concentration was
determined by using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). Samples were electrophoretically separated
using 10% Bis–Tris gels or 3–8% Tris–acetate gel (Bio-
Rad, Richmond, CA), according to the molecular weight
of the target molecule, and then transferred onto nitro-
cellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). They were blocked with
Odyssey blocking buffer for 1 h; and then incubated
with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After three
washing cycles with T-TBS, membranes were incubated
with IRDye 800CW or IRDye 680CW-labeled secondary
antibodies (LI-COR Bioscience, NE) at 22°C for 1 h.
Signals were developed with Odyssey Infrared Imaging
Systems (LI-COR Bioscience). Primary antibodies used
in this paper are summarized in Table 1. Actin was
always used as an internal loading control.
Biochemical analysis
Mouse brain homogenates were sequentially extracted first
in RIPA buffer for the soluble and then in formic acid
(FA) for the insoluble protein fraction as previously
described15,16. Ab1-40 and Ab1-42 levels were assayed by
a sensitive sandwich ELISA kits (WAKO Chem., Rich-
mond, VA).
Immunohistochemistry
Primary
antibodies
used
in
this
study
are
listed
in Table 1. Immunostaining was performed as reported
previously.13–16 Briefly, serial 6-lm thick coronal sections
were mounted on 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane-coated
slides. Every eighth section from the habenular to the
posterior commissure (8–10 sections per animal) was
examined using unbiased stereological principles. The sec-
tions for Ab were deparaffinized, hydrated, pretreated
with formic acid (FA; 88%) and subsequently with 3%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol. The sections for tau were
deparaffinized, hydrated, treated with 3% H2O2 in metha-
nol and citrate (10 mmol/L) for antigen retrieval. Sections
were blocked in 2% fetal bovine serum and incubated
with primary antibody for total tau (HT-7), phospho-tau
(PHF-13, AT8), synaptophysin (SYP), microglia (Iba1)
and Ab (4G8) overnight at 4°C. The following day, sec-
tions
were
incubated
with
biotinylated
anti-mouse
immunoglobulin G (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA) and then developed by using the avidin–biotin com-
plex method (Vector Laboratories) with 3,30-diaminoben-
zidine
as
a
chromogen.
Consecutives
sections
were
incubated in the absence of primary antibodies to ensure
specificity of staining.

Results
Effect of EVOO-rich diet on animal weight
During
the
6-months
treatment,
mice
that
received
EVOO-enriched diet grew from an initial average weight
of 27.48 � 2.44 gr to 35.48 � 4.22 gr. On the other
hand, animals on a regular chow grew from an average
weight of 26.9 � 3.87 to 31.88 �
3.77. Overall, we did
not observe any statistically significant difference between
the two groups of mice during the study, except for the

EVOO-rich diet restores working and spatial
memory in 3xTg mice
To determine the effect of EVOO-rich diet on behavior,
animals were initially tested at 6 months to establish their
behavioral baseline performance. Mice were tested again
in the same tasks after 3 and 6 months on the EVOO-rich
diet, at age of 9 and 12 months respectively. As shown in
Figure 1B,
in
the
Y-maze,
compared
with
baseline
(6 months), the mice at 9 and 12 months showed a reduc-
tion in the number of entries that reached the statistical
significance for the CTR group at 9 months. When we
assessed the percentage of alternation, as expected, we
observed a reduction of this parameter in the CTR group
at both 9 and 12 months but, this was completely rescued
in the EVOO treated mice (Fig. 1B). Next, mice under-
went
fear
conditioning
testing.
No
differences
were
observed in the freezing time during the training session
(not shown) and during the contextual recall of the EVOO
mice compared with their controls in both time points
(Fig. 1C). Compared to control, the EVOO group had an
increased freezing response activity in the cued recall
phase, but the difference did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (Fig. 1C). Finally, animals were tested in the Morris
water-maze paradigm. All mice in each group were able to
reach the training criterion within 4 days and no differ-
ences were found during the training session (not shown).

 However, during the probe test at 12 month of age
(6 months of treatment) we observed that compared with
controls, mice receiving the EVOO-diet had a higher
number of entries in the platform zone, and spent more
time in the platform zone and in the NE zone (Fig. 1D).
EVOO-rich diet reduces Ab levels and
deposition in 3xTg mice
At 12 months of age, mice were euthanized and brain
cortex homogenates assayed for Ab levels in the RIPA-
soluble and formic acid-soluble fractions. Compared with
controls,
we
found
that
EVOO
group
presented
a
decrease in Ab1-40 levels that reached the statistical sig-
nificance only the in the formic acid soluble fraction.
Although we observed a reduction in the Ab1-42 RIPA–
soluble and formic acid soluble fractions in brain homo-
genates from the EVOO-treated mice, in both cases the
differences failed to reach statistical significance (Fig. 2A
and B). An analysis of the Ab 42/40 ratios for the
RIPA-soluble and formic acid-soluble fractions between
the two groups of mice (control/treated) did not show
any significant differences (0.25 vs. 0.14 and 0.06 vs. 0.08
respectively). Next, we investigated the effect of EVOO on
Ab deposition by immunohistochemistry. Compared with
CTR, we found a statistically significant reduction in the
amount of Ab peptides deposited in the brains of the
EVOO-treated animals as measured by 4G8 immunoreac-
tivity (Fig. 2C and D).
To elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for
the effect on the Ab levels and deposition, we assayed the
levels of the Ab precursor protein (APP) and the pro-
teases involved in its metabolism by Western blot. Com-
pared with controls, we found that, EVOO-treated mice
had a significant increase in b-secretase (BACE1), sAPP-b
and a-secretase (ADAM10) levels (Fig. 2E and F). By con-
trast, the sAPP-a increased levels failed to reach statistical
significance (Fig. 2E and F). No changes were observed in
the levels of APP and three of the four components of
c-secretase (i.e., APH1, nicastrin, and Pen2) when the two

 groups were compared (Fig. 2E and F). Compared with
controls, brain homogenates from EVOO-treated mice
had a significant increase in the levels of the APP-bCTF
(Fig. S1). Finally, we looked at some of the proteins that
have been involved in Ab clearance, but no significant
differences were found between the two groups in the
steady state levels of apolipoprotein E (APOE), neprilysin
(CD10), and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) (Fig. 2E
and F).
EVOO-rich diet attenuates tau pathology
Next, we investigated the effect of EVOO-rich diet con-
sumption on tau phosphorylation and pathology in the
brain cortices of the same mice. As shown in Figure 3A,
we found a significant reduction in the phosphorylated
forms of tau at Ser202/Thr205 and Ser396/Ser404, as rec-
ognized by the antibodies AT8 and PHF13, respectively,
in the EVOO group when compared with mice on a regu-
lar diet. No significant effect of the treatment was
observed when the levels of total tau were assessed in the
same brain region (Fig. 3A and B). These results were
further
confirmed
by
immunohistochemical
analyses
(Fig. 3C and D). Since we found changes in tau phospho-
rylation, next we examined some of the kinases and phos-
phatases, which are considered major regulators of tau
post-translational modifications. As shown in Figure 3E,
we did not find any changes between control and EVOO-
treated mice in the steady-state levels of P38 MAPK,
CDK5 and its two co-activators p35 and p25. By contrast,
compared with controls, immunoblot analysis showed a
significant decrease in P38 active phosphorylated form
(p-P38). Finally, mice fed with EVOO-enriched diet had
significantly
higher
level
of
protein
phosphatase

EVOO-rich diet improves synapse integrity
and neuroinflammation
To assess whether the improved cognitive performance
and AD pathology seen in the EVOO-treated mice was
also biochemically characterized by an amelioration of
synaptic integrity, we assayed the steady state levels of
two major synaptic proteins: synaptophysin (SYP) indices

 of presynaptic integrity, and the postsynaptic density pro-
tein 95 (PSD95). As shown in Figure 4A, no differences
were observed between the two groups when PSD95 levels
were measured. By contrast, mice fed with EVOO-rich
diet when compared with the control group, displayed a
statistically significant increase in the steady state levels of
SYP. Confirming the immunoblot data, EVOO-treated
mice showed a significant increase in brain immunoreac-
tivity for SYP (Fig. 4C and D). In addition, we observed
that compared with controls, mice receiving the EVOO-
rich diet had a significant reduction in the steady state
levels of IBA1, a marker of microglia activation, which
was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4 E
and F). By contrast, no differences between the two
groups were found when GFAP levels, marker of astro-
cytes activation, were assayed (Fig. 4E and F).
EVOO-rich diet does not affect CREB
signaling on 3xTg mice
Since CREB and CREB-regulated proteins have been pre-
viously reported to be altered in AD pathology, next we
investigated the effect of our EVOO-rich diet on total
CREB levels and its phosphorylated form at Ser133 (p-
CREB). As shown in Figure 5, the levels of total CREB

EVOO-rich diet induces autophagy in 3xTg
mice
Since we observed that chronic administration of EVOO-
rich diet resulted in a marked reduction in Ab deposition
but we did not find differences in the Ab degrading
enzymes (i.e., IDE, ApoE and CD10), we looked at several
autophagy markers. Among them, we assessed ATG5-12,
ATG7 and the microtubule-associated protein light chain
3 conversion (LC3I/II) which are considered essential for
the
autophagosome
formation
and
autophagic
flux,
respectively.17,18

Discussion
The data presented in the current paper demonstrate that
chronic administration of a diet enriched with EVOO
results in an amelioration of working memory, spatial
learning, and synaptic pathology, a significant reduction
in the amount and deposition of Ab peptides, and a
decrease in the tau neuropathology secondary to an acti-
vation of authophagy.
Taken together our findings provide strong experimen-
tal support for the translational value of EVOO as a
therapeutic tool with potential disease-modifying activity
for AD since it beneficially influenced all three major
aspects of the AD phenotype in the implemented disease
model.
Increasing evidence has been accumulated showing that
chronic exposure to the Mediterranean diet associates
with a lower risk of AD and cognitive impairments.19,20
The diet was originally described in studies focusing on
food intake in countries of the Mediterranean area such
as Italy and Greece, and its relationship with rates of
chronic diseases and life expectancy. It soon became
apparent that this specific diet was associated with longer
life expectancy and lower rates of cardiovascular diseases
and dementias than the ones observed in populations
exposed to other diets.21 Thus, the results of several
cross-sectional investigations have been mainly consistent
showing positive outcomes. Among the key elements of
the Mediterranean diet, an important role has been attrib-
uted to daily intake of fresh fruit and vegetable, cereals,
beans, and legumes and the usage of EVOO as a primary
source of fat.22 In particular, average daily consumption
of 30–50 mL per day of EVOO has been suggested as the
most important and integral component of the diet23,24
resulting in the common idea that EVOO plays a major
role in the health benefit of this diet.
Previous in vitro studies have shown that EVOO posi-
tively modulates cell membrane structure in response to
free-radical dependent oxidative stress.25 Others have
demonstrated that EVOO has direct antioxidant property

 by acting as scavenger of reactive oxygen species and
blocker of free radical formation in cellular system.26 On
the other hand, animal model studies have provided evi-
dence for a beneficial effect of EVOO on behavior as well
as brain amyloidosis.27 However, since these models do
not develop the second most important hallmark lesion
of the AD brain pathology, it remains to be investigated
whether or not EVOO has a beneficial effect on the devel-
opment of tau neuropathology.
To address this scientific question, we utilized a different
mouse model, the 3xTg, which by contrast with the ones
implemented previously in addition to Ab plaques develop
AD-like tau neurofibrillary tangle pathology. First, com-
pared with 3xTg kept on a regular chow diet, the ones
receiving
EVOO-supplemented
diet
had
a
significant
improvement in the percentage of spontaneous alternations
in the Y-maze, a paradigm, which assesses rodent working
memory.28 Importantly, no significant differences were
observed between the two groups when the number of
entries in each arm of the maze was considered suggesting
that the diet did not alter the motor ability of the mice.
In addition, we observed that the same mice performed
better the probe test, which measures their spatial learn-
ing and memory ability. Supporting the beneficial effect
on the behavior responses, we found that the same mice
had biochemical evidence for a reduction in synaptic
pathology as demonstrated by the higher levels of synap-
tophysin, a well-established presynaptic marker, in the
brains of EVOO-treated mice.
Consistent with the behavioral results, and confirming
previous
observation,
we
found
that
mice
receiving
EVOO-rich diet had a reduction in the formic acid-
soluble fraction of the Ab1-40. This was associated with a
significant decrease in the Ab immunoreactivity in the
cortex and hippocampus brain regions of the same mice
suggesting that Ab deposition was significantly affected in
the EVOO treated group. When we assessed the prote-
olytic enzymes and pathways involved in the APP meta-
bolism differently from another report we observed that
compared with controls, the treated mice had an increase
in a-secretase and b-secretase and their products, s-APPa
and the sAPPb.11 While that study does not provide data
on these two proteases, we think that the discrepancy in
the result for the sAPPb could be secondary to the
different mouse model implemented by the authors.11
Moreover, by contrast with other reports, we were not
able to show any effect of the EVOO on some of the
major protein systems in place to control Ab clearance
and degradation.29 Thus, steady state levels of apoE, a
major Ab chaperone, levels of neprilysin and IDE, two
major Ab catabolic pathways, were no different between
the controls and EVOO-treated mice.

 Here, we show for the first time that chronic supple-
mentation of EVOO-rich diet results in a modulation of
tau
metabolism.
By
using
both
biochemistry
and
immunohistochemistry approaches, we found that 3xTg
mice receiving the diet containing EVOO had a signifi-
cant reduction in tau phosphorylation. This decrease was
selective, because it was observed only at Ser202/Thr205
(as recognized by the antibody AT8), and at Ser396 (as
recognized by the antibody PHF13), but not at other tau
epitopes. By contrast, no effect of EVOO was observed
when we assayed the level of total soluble tau protein. To
determine the molecular mechanism responsible for the
reduced tau phosphorylation, next we assessed the levels
of some of the kinases and phosphatases which have been
considered major players in tau post-transcriptional mod-
ifications. In our study, we found that while the cdk5
pathway was not different between the two groups, mice
receiving EVOO-rich diet had a significant reduction in
the phosphorylated form of the p38 kinase, and a signifi-
cant elevation of the steady state levels of phosphatase
PP2A.
Aside from Ab, tau and synaptic pathology, activation
of microglia and astrocytes is another important feature
found consistently in the AD brain, and some work even
suggests that these cells play a functional role in AD
pathogenesis.30 Interestingly, in our study we found that
the expression levels of IBA1, a marker of microglia acti-
vation, was significantly reduced in the EVOO-treated
mice.
Based on the observation that EVOO treated mice had
a reduction in the insoluble forms of Ab and in the
pro-aggregatory highly phosphorylated isoforms of tau
protein, we hypothesized a potential involvement of the
cellular clearing system as the mechanism responsible for
the biological effect. For this reason, next we assessed sev-
eral markers of autophagy activation in the brain of the
two groups of mice. Consistent with our hypothesis, we
noted that compared with controls, brains from EVOO-
treated mice had a significant increase in the steady state
levels of ATG5 and ATG7, which are established biomark-
ers of autophagy activation. Interestingly our conclusion
is in agreement with previous observations showing that
oleochantal, a major component of EVOO, can act as an
activator of autophagy.31
In conclusion, our investigation establishes for the first
time to the best of our knowledge a protective effect of
EVOO
in
modulating
tau
phosphorylation,
memory
impairments, synaptic integrity, and neuroinflammation
in a mouse model of AD with plaques and tangles.
The translational value of our findings lies in the obser-
vation that EVOO supplementation can influence the
entire spectrum of the AD phenotype. Our studies pro-
vide mechanistic support to the positive cross-sectional
and longitudinal data on this component of the Mediter-
ranean diet, and most importantly the biological rationale
to the novel hypothesis that EVOO could be considered
as a viable therapeutic opportunity for preventing or halt-
ing AD.
