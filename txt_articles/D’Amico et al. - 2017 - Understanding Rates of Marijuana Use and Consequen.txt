Abstract
Purpose of Review There is not one answer to address wheth-
er marijuana use has increased, decreased, or stayed the same
given changes in state legalization of medical and non-
medical marijuana in the USA.
Recent Findings Evidence suggests some health benefits
for medical marijuana; however, initiation of marijuana
use is a risk factor for developing problem cannabis use.
Though use rates have remained stable over recent years,
about one in three 10th graders report marijuana use, most
adolescents do not view the drug as harmful, and over
650,000 youth aged 12 to 17 struggle with cannabis use
disorder.
Summary Although the health benefits of medical marijuana
are becoming better understood, more research is needed.
Intervention and prevention programs must better address ef-
fects of marijuana, acknowledging that while there may be
some benefits medically, marijuana use can affect functioning
during adolescence when the brain is still developing.

Introduction
Since 1996, when California became the first state to pass a
comprehensive medical marijuana law (MML), 29 states in
the USA have legalized marijuana for medical purposes as
of 2017. Eight states have expanded marijuana laws that allow
for legalized recreational, production, and for-profit sales
among adults aged 21 and older. Washington DC also has
legalized marijuana possession for recreational purposes, but
not production or sales. It has been speculated that more states
will begin passing recreational marijuana laws in the coming
elections. The current paper provides a brief overview of mar-
ijuana use and consequences among adolescents given the
changing legal landscape in the USA. We first discuss overall
trends of marijuana use and consequences from use. We next
address the benefits and harms associated with the use of
medical marijuana given the current state of research. Third,
we provide a brief review of the evidence regarding effects of
MMLs on perceptions of risk, use, and consequences. Finally,
we discuss the challenge of reducing marijuana use among
adolescents and policy implications for prevention and inter-
vention for this age group.
According to one of the biggest national studies,
Monitoring the Future [1], rates of lifetime marijuana use
among adolescents over the last 5 years have remained fairly
steady among 12th graders (45% report lifetime use); whereas
among younger ages, initiation of use has declined somewhat.
For example, in 2012, about 16% of eighth graders had

 initiated marijuana use, but in 2016, 13% reported initiation of
the drug. Likewise, about 35% of 10th graders reported life-
time use of marijuana in 2012, which decreased to 30% in
2016 [1]. Despite these decreases in lifetime use, it is impor-
tant to note that these percentages still reflect a significant
number of teens that report trying marijuana (e.g., one in three
15–16-year-olds). In addition, another large national study, the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), estimat-
ed that approximately 650,000 youth aged 12 to 17 met
criteria for cannabis use disorder (CUD) in 2015 [2].
Problematic marijuana use continues to be an issue for
young people. One recent study by D’Amico and colleagues
[3•] examined rates of both marijuana and alcohol use, as well
as alcohol use and cannabis use disorders in a large and di-
verse sample of 1573 youth age 12–18 (21% Black, 51%
Hispanic) attending a primary care appointment in either
California or Pennsylvania. Past-year marijuana use was
slightly lower than alcohol use (37% and 42%, respectively),
as was past-year heavy marijuana use (e.g., using two or more
times in 1 day; 19%) compared to heavy alcohol use (e.g., five
or more drinks; 22%); however, CUD was three times more
prevalent than alcohol use disorder (14% and 4%, respective-
ly). Thus, although rates of use for alcohol and marijuana were
fairly similar among these adolescents, they were more likely
to report problematic use of marijuana [3•]. For example, on
the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV
(DISC-IV), which included updated DSM-5 criteria for
CUD, 48% of youth reported that they had tried to quit or
cut down their marijuana use compared to 16% of adolescents
who reported that they tried to quit or cut back on their drink-
ing. In addition, 32% of teens in this study reported going to
school or work when they were high or smoking marijuana
while at school or work compared to 14% who reported going
to school or work after drinking or drinking while at school or
work. Other problems youth reported included smoking more
marijuana than they thought they would (40%), getting into
arguments with family members or friends because of using
marijuana (23%), and that marijuana caused them to get sad,
depressed, or irritable (14%).
There is growing evidence that marijuana use may cause
more problems in functioning during adolescence than alco-
hol use. One 2016 large longitudinal school-based study
found that marijuana use was associated with poorer function-
ing in high school across more domains compared to alcohol
use [4]. Specifically, our team examined how marijuana and
alcohol use trajectories from age 11 to 17 years were associ-
ated with key domains of functioning during high school.
Teens with greater marijuana use indicated more academic
unpreparedness and poorer academic performance, increased
delinquency, and worse mental health in high school. Youth
that reported higher alcohol use also indicated poorer func-
tioning, but only in two domains: greater academic unpre-
paredness and delinquency. Furthermore, non-white youth
appeared to be disproportionately affected by marijuana use
(as well as alcohol use), reporting worse outcomes for aca-
demics and health compared to white youth, even at the same
levels of use [4]. Overall, research documents that adolescent
marijuana use and resulting consequences are a public health
concern that need to be addressed.
Medical Marijuana: Benefits and Harms
The health benefits of medical marijuana are becoming better
understood, though there is still much research to be done, and
the majority of work in this area has been established with
adults. A recent report from the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [5] concluded that there
is moderate to substantial evidence supporting marijuana use
as an effective treatment for chronic pain, alleviating
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, improving spas-
ticity symptoms among patients with multiple sclerosis, and
improving short-term sleep outcomes among those with ob-
structive sleep apnea syndrome. Importantly, however, the
same report concluded that there is substantial evidence that
marijuana use has negative long-term effects such as worsen-
ing respiratory symptoms (e.g., chronic cough, bronchitis),
increased risk of motor vehicle accidents when driving under
the influence, lower birth rates of offspring from mothers who
use the drug, and increased risk for developing schizophrenia
or other psychoses [5]. Overall, it is important to note that
studies are typically limited by a lack of standardization of
dosing and potency, including cannabidiol (CBD) to tetrahy-
drocannabinol (THC) ratios, which makes marijuana a chal-
lenging substance to regulate for medical purposes [6].
The report from the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine [5] also concludes that there is
substantial evidence that early initiation of marijuana use, as
well as increases in frequency of use during adolescence, are
risk factors for the development of problem cannabis use later
in life. Other earlier reviews of adolescent marijuana use have
concluded that early and chronic use may have negative ef-
fects on several cognitive and mental health factors, such as
executive functioning [7], depression [8], and use of other
substances [9]. Thus, even though some benefits of medical
marijuana have been found, as noted above, most of the re-
search on medical marijuana to date has been conducted with
adults. Overall, very little is known about medicinal benefits
of marijuana for adolescents. Indeed, the available research on
harms suggests that early initiation of marijuana, increased
marijuana use during adolescence, and chronic marijuana
use over time is linked to problems.
Concerning the use of medical marijuana by adolescents
specifically, Boyd and colleagues [10] found that only 1% of
the approximately 4400 12th graders in the 2012/2013
Monitoring the Future sample reported using medical
344
Curr Addict Rep (2017) 4:343–349
 marijuana that they had obtained as part of their own recom-
mendation from a provider that qualified them for participa-
tion in their state’s medical marijuana program. (This is often
called a marijuana “prescription” by those that obtain this
recommendation; thus, hereafter we refer to this as a prescrip-
tion.) Interestingly, 6% of the sample reported use of medical
marijuana that was obtained from someone else’s prescription
(diverted marijuana use) [10]. Of the 12th graders that report-
ed past-year marijuana use, 80% did not obtain it from a legal
or medical source, 3% reported marijuana use from their own
prescription, and 17% reported “diverted marijuana use.”
Findings indicated that those who obtained marijuana from
their own prescription or from someone else’s prescription
were more at risk across a host of outcomes, including higher
rates of frequent and daily marijuana use, greater likelihood of
reporting “being hooked” on marijuana, and greater risk for
using other prescription drugs non-medically and using other
illicit drugs than those who obtained marijuana from a non-
legal or non-medical source [10]. Thus, adolescents who ob-
tain medical marijuana with a prescription, either their own or
someone else’s, represent a group that is at high risk for nu-
merous problems.
Effects of Medical Marijuana Laws on Perceptions
of Risk, Use, and Consequences
Given the increasingly widespread legalization of medical and
recreational marijuana across the USA, there have been a
number of recent high-quality epidemiological studies exam-
ining changes in overall marijuana use rates among adoles-
cents before and after the passage of marijuana legalization
laws attempting to answer the following important question:
have marijuana use rates increased, decreased, or stayed the
same following legalization? At this point, it is difficult to
determine the “final answer.” [11, 12] This is partly due to
the heterogeneous nature of these studies. For example, some
studies are national, some occur in single states with legalized
medical marijuana, and still others take place in states where
marijuana is legal for both medical and recreational posses-
sion, sale, and cultivation [13]. The story is further complicat-
ed by the nuances in policy in different states (e.g., registration
requirements, home cultivation, dispensaries) and the timing
of these policies [14]. For example, Pacula and colleagues
[14] demonstrated the disadvantages of treating medical
MMLs generically, showing that specific modes of regulation
differentially influenced consumption, highlighting the impor-
tance of understanding the heterogeneity of these laws.
Specifically, they found that access to dispensaries or home
cultivation may increase marijuana consumption, including
among adolescents, even though simple dichotomous indica-
tors (e.g., yes MML versus no MML) were generally not
associated with marijuana use. In addition, they found that
marijuana dependence was higher in states that had more le-
nient access to medical marijuana, such as home cultivation
and state acceptance of dispensaries [14].
Other studies have also failed to find a clear link between
MMLs and increased use among adolescents [12, 15], includ-
ing one recent large scale study of over one million adoles-
cents surveyed between 1991 and 2014. Results showed that
despite finding higher rates of marijuana prevalence in states
that had passed an MML compared to those that did not, rates
of marijuana use did not increase significantly within states
from before to after the passage of MMLs [16•]. In addition,
although according to NSDUH the rates of CUDs have been
declining among youth over the past 12 years [2], rates of
CUD among adults have increased in states with MMLs
[17]. Pacula and Smart [18] note, however, that disparate find-
ings across and within studies could also be attributed to the
way that marijuana use is measured, such as whether the stud-
ies examining associations between MMLs and adolescent
marijuana use utilized measures of past-month use, frequency
of use, quantity of use, heavy use, or dependence.
With the rapidly changing landscape of marijuana policy
across the USA, there has been increasing interest in assessing
the effects of these policy changes on teens as the outcomes
may not be clear for some time [11]. For example, Friese and
Grube [19] examined the association between adolescent mar-
ijuana use and voter approval of medical marijuana and the
number of medical marijuana cards issued in a sample of
17,482 adolescents age 13–19 across several counties in
Montana. They found that youth reported greater lifetime
and past 30-day use of marijuana when they lived in counties
with a higher percentage of voters approving legalization of
medical marijuana; however, the number of medical marijua-
na cards was not related to marijuana use [19]. This suggests
that more positive perceptions of the drug may be affecting
overall adolescent use.
Overall, there has been a trend towards more positive views
of marijuana among both adults [20] and teens in recent years
[21, 22]. More than 50% of 10th and 12th graders across the
USA now endorse the belief that smoking marijuana regularly
does not carry great risk (note that this question does not
address other ways of using marijuana, such as vaping or
edibles) [23]. In Washington state, which legalized medical
and non-medical marijuana in 2012 (with stores commencing
sale of recreational marijuana in 2014), one study found that
the positive association between low perceived harm and mar-
ijuana use has grown stronger since 2000 [22]. A 2014
Monitoring the Future study cross-sectionally examined per-
ceived harmfulness of marijuana use by grade, stratified by
state MML status, and found that overall, adolescents living in
states that had ever passed an MML were less likely to per-
ceive marijuana as harmful [24].
Many of these positive beliefs for marijuana may come
from social media and/or advertising, which has increased as
Curr Addict Rep (2017) 4:343–349

 MMLs have passed. For example, among people ages 17 to
19 years, the popular pro-marijuana Twitter handle
@stillblazingtho was in the top 10% of all Twitter handles
followed [25]. Examinations of the more proximal effects of
MML passage are critical: advertising, accessibility, and the
growing prevalence of adults who use medical marijuana may
drive adolescent perceptions of use. In a cohort of approxi-
mately 8000 youth with a mean age of 13, D’Amico and
colleagues [26] found that sixth and eighth graders’ exposure
to advertising for medical marijuana was associated with both
intentions to use marijuana and marijuana use 1 year later.
This highlights the importance of beginning to think about
regulations for marijuana advertising [26], similar to regula-
tions that are in place for tobacco and alcohol [27].
Though billboards, magazines, and social media can in-
crease young people’s exposure to marijuana advertisements,
the proliferation of medical marijuana and recreational mari-
juana dispensaries no doubt also increases adolescents’ expo-
sure to the drug. Specific methods to examine accessibility to
dispensaries have been proposed to map dispensary locations
given that these tend to fluctuate (e.g., a dispensary that is
open today may not be open in 6 months) [28–30]. More work
will be needed as policies rapidly change to get a better handle
on effects of the actual dispensaries, including longitudinal
studies that can address temporality. To date, only one study
has examined how proximity to marijuana dispensaries affect
adolescent marijuana use. This cross-sectional study used
Monitoring the Future data and found that the availability of
medical marijuana dispensaries within a 5-mile buffer zone
was associated with a higher likelihood of recent marijuana
use by eighth graders, and being within either a 5-mile or 25-
mile buffer zone was associated with an increased likelihood
of recent marijuana use for 10th graders [31]. Monitoring the
Future data [1] indicate that 35% of eighth graders and the
majority of 10th (64%) and 12th (81%) graders report that
marijuana is “fairly easy” or “very easy” to get. More work
is needed in this area to understand the pathways through
which proximity to dispensaries may be related to subsequent
marijuana use among adolescents.
In terms of adverse consequences related to MML passage,
Plunk and colleagues examined the effects of exposure to
MMLs on high school completion, college enrollment, and
college completion [32]. They used data from the 2000
Census and 2001–2014 American Community Surveys.
Exposure was defined as any exposure to policy of generic
MMLs (i.e., irrespective of specific features of MML policy)
while adolescents were of high school age (i.e., 14–18). They
also assigned policy exposure based on the number of years
that youth were exposed to the MML between the ages of 14
and 18 with possible values of 0–4 to reflect years of exposure
during high school (i.e., exposure beginning at age 18 would
be 1 year, age 17 was equal to 2 years, age 16 was equivalent
to 3 years, and ages 14–15 equaled 4 years). They found that
MML exposure was associated with a 0.40 increase in the
probability of not earning a high school diploma (from
3.99% probability of not earning a HS diploma to 4.39%).
In addition, exposure to MML during high school was asso-
ciated with a higher probability of both college non-
enrollment and degree non-completion (a 0.85 increase from
45.30% to 46.15%). Furthermore, MML exposure was asso-
ciated with an increase in daily marijuana use among 12th
graders (up from 1.25% to 2.11%) [32].
Other health risks may be related to changes in marijuana
legalization. There is evidence that marijuana legalization is
associated with the co-use of tobacco and marijuana. Data
from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH) indicate that a higher proportion of past 30-day
tobacco and marijuana co-users reside in states where medical
marijuana is legal compared to states where it is illegal [33].
Although the reasons for marijuana and tobacco co-use are
poorly understood and likely multifaceted [34, 35], there
has been increasing public health concern that tobacco use
may begin to increase among young people as a conse-
quence of marijuana legalization. Cannabis and tobacco
are often smoked on the same occasion, with some early
research suggesting that these simultaneous users are at
greater risk for CUDs [36]. Co-administration is another
popular form of co-use; an example of this is blunt
smoking, which involves replacing some or most of the
tobacco in a cigar with marijuana [37].
Furthermore, marijuana-impaired driving has doubled in
recent years for high school seniors across the USA, and teens
report driving under the influence of marijuana at higher rates
than driving under the influence of alcohol [38]. Nearly one in
five teens reports driving under the influence of marijuana,
34% of whom believed their driving ability was improved
after marijuana use [39], and younger drivers are especially
likely to believe that driving under the influence of marijuana
is socially acceptable and safe [40]. These data suggest that
youth are not as concerned about driving under the influence
of marijuana compared to alcohol, emphasizing that marijuana
use and consequences may be viewed differently than alcohol
use and consequences [41]. Overall, findings highlight the
importance of addressing marijuana use and its potential con-
sequences among this population.
The Challenge of Reducing Marijuana Use
Among Adolescents
It is crucial that we begin to address marijuana use in this
changing legal landscape. This requires a good understanding
of how medical marijuana may be used and a focus on
recreational use. The National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine [5] report discusses identifying
research gaps, improving data collection, and proposing
346
Curr Addict Rep (2017) 4:343–349
 strategies to address barriers for marijuana research [5].
Furthermore, this report noted that marijuana potency has in-
creased [42], and that different forms of marijuana have be-
come popular, including edibles, vaping, and dabs [43•, 44].
In order to work with youth around this issue, providers must
have a good understanding of the research, the reasons that
youth may use marijuana (e.g., for a perceived health benefit
versus recreationally), and the ways in which they may use
marijuana.
Our prevention and intervention work with at risk teens
[45] and emerging young adults age 18–25 [46] has shown
that marijuana use may be more difficult to change than alco-
hol use, in part because youth view the consequences from
marijuana use differently [41, 46]. Specifically, they tend to
see fewer consequences occurring from their marijuana use
because they view it as safer to use than alcohol, and they
are also able to more clearly connect consequences to their
drinking behavior than to their marijuana use [41]. Given this,
and recent evidence of perceptions of marijuana harm decreas-
ing [22, 25], intervention and prevention programs must better
address the effects of marijuana, acknowledging that while
there may be some benefits medically, marijuana use can af-
fect functioning during adolescence [3, 4] when the brain is
still developing [47].
Our work with at risk youth in a teen court setting [41, 48]
and with urban Native American adolescents [49], for exam-
ple, has emphasized the importance of discussing both the
pros and cons of marijuana use with youth using a motivation-
al interviewing (MI) approach [50]. In this MI approach, ther-
apists discuss the nuances of research on the medical “bene-
fits” of marijuana use versus recreational use, and also address
how frequency and quantity of use and marijuana use over
time can impact health, relationships, and attainment of edu-
cational and work goals. We have created a website at www.
groupmiforteens.org that provides free online training for
conducting MI in groups with teens and shows how to best
discuss marijuana use, including addressing medical
marijuana use. We also make our manuals available for free
on this site, which provide different ways to talk to teens about
marijuana use in a non-confrontational and collaborative
manner.
Policy Implications and Conclusions
In sum, work has shown that specific components of MMLs
(e.g., access to dispensaries or home cultivation) are associat-
ed with marijuana use and that these same components are
associated with fatal car accidents and increased heavy drink-
ing [14]. In addition, exposure to medical marijuana advertis-
ing [26] and perhaps proximity to dispensaries [31] are both
associated with an increased likelihood of marijuana use
among younger adolescents, although no longitudinal studies
have yet been conducted on proximity to dispensaries. History
from the tobacco and alcohol industries emphasizes the im-
portance of having policies and regulations around advertising
and outlet density. Pacula and colleagues [27] highlight spe-
cific areas that policymakers may want to address regarding
marijuana legalization including: developing regulations that
help reduce access, availability, and use by adolescents, driv-
ing under the influence, and concurrent use of marijuana and
alcohol, particularly in public places. As other states move to
legalize marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes,
it will be crucial to address how marijuana should be regulated
in order to decrease the chances of harm occurring.
