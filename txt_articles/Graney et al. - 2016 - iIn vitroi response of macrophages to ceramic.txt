Macrophages, the primary cells of the inflammatory response, are major
regulators of healing, and mediate both bone fracture healing and the
inflammatory response to implanted biomaterials. However, their pheno-
typic contributions to biomaterial-mediated bone repair are incompletely
understood. Therefore, we used gene expression and protein secretion analysis
to investigate the interactions in vitro between primary human monocyte-
derived macrophages and ceramic scaffolds that have been shown to
have varying degrees of success in promoting bone regeneration in vivo.
Specifically, baghdadite (Ca3ZrSi2O9) and strontium–hardystonite–gahnite
(Sr–Ca2ZnSi2O7–ZnAl2O4) scaffolds were chosen as two materials that
enhanced bone regeneration in vivo in large defects under load compared
with clinically used tricalcium phosphate–hydroxyapatite (TCP–HA). Princi-
pal component analysis revealed that the scaffolds differentially regulated
macrophage phenotype. Temporal changes in gene expression included
shifts in markers of pro-inflammatory M1, anti-inflammatory M2a and
pro-remodelling M2c macrophage phenotypes. Of note, TCP–HA scaffolds
promoted upregulation of many M1-related genes and downregulation
of many M2a- and M2c-related genes. Effects of the scaffolds on macro-
phages were attributed primarily to direct cell–scaffold interactions because
of only minor changes observed in transwell culture. Ultimately, eluci-
dating macrophage–biomaterial interactions will facilitate the design of
immunomodulatory biomaterials for bone repair.
1. Introduction
More than 6 million bone fractures occur annually in the USA alone [1,2], and
5–10% of these fail to heal adequately owing to bone loss, failed fixation, infec-
tion and poor vascularization [1]. Bone is a unique tissue in that small fractures
can self-repair, without fibrous scarring [3], but large, critical-sized bone defects
remain a challenge [4]. Therefore, there is a significant need for regenerative
medicine strategies that use materials to harness the intrinsic ability of bone
to repair itself.
Fracture healing occurs through a complex cascade of events initiated by a
trauma-induced inflammatory response and involves ossification and bone
remodelling [5–8]. The process of inflammation represents a crucial stage in
bone repair. Inflammatory cells not only recruit osteoprogenitor cells to the
fracture site, but also stimulate revascularization [6,8,9], a required process
for tissue survival. Studies have shown that in the absence of a fracture
haematoma, which normally initiates the inflammatory cascade, fracture
healing is impaired [10,11]. However, chronic inflammation inhibits healing
of bone [12] and many other tissues [13]. Thus, a precisely controlled
inflammatory response is critical for successful fracture healing.

 Macrophages, the primary cells of the inflammatory
response, are widely accepted as regulators of wound healing
[14] and have been shown to play important roles in endochon-
dral ossification [15], bone deposition and mineralization [16]
and differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors [17] during
fracture repair. This multifaceted behaviour stems from the
fact that macrophages rapidly shift their phenotype in response
to changing environmental stimuli, which is critical for success-
ful wound healing [18]. In the normal healing process of many
tissues, including bone fractures, the macrophage population
shifts from predominantly pro-inflammatory (M1) to predomi-
nantly anti-inflammatory (M2) over time [19], perhaps because
of sequential actions of the two populations in promoting
angiogenesis [20,21]. M1 macrophages can also be activated
in vitro by pro-inflammatory signals such as lipopolysaccharide
and interferon-gamma. M2 macrophages can also be further
described as ‘M2a’ (stimulated in vitro by interleukin (IL) 4+
IL13) or ‘M2c’ (stimulated in vitro by IL10, transforming
growth factor-beta or glucocorticoids), which are believed to
promote tissue deposition and remodelling, respectively,
although their roles are incompletely understood [20,22].
Although microenvironmental signals have major effects on
macrophage behaviour [23], it is not understood how biomater-
ialsimpactthe microenvironmentina bone fracture to modulate
macrophagebehaviourand affect healingoutcomes. Thus, there
is a need to investigate how macrophages respond to biomater-
ials used in bone regeneration.
Recently, Roohani et al. [24–26] demonstrated that novel
ceramic-based
scaffolds,
baghdadite
(Ca3ZrSi2O9)
and
strontium–hardystonite–gahnite (Sr–HT–gahnite; Sr–Ca2
ZnSi2O7–ZnAl2O4), were more successful at regenerating
large bone defects under load than the clinical standard,
tricalcium phosphate–hydroxyapatite (TCP–HA) scaffolds.
Both baghdadite and Sr–HT–gahnite resulted in extensive
new bone formation and complete bridging of critical-sized
radial segmental defects in rabbits 12 weeks post-implantation,
compared with only partial bridging demonstrated by TCP–
HA [24–26]. In sheep segmental defect models, baghdadite
scaffolds showed a significant bridging of the critical-sized
defect (average 80%) with evidence of bone infiltration and
remodelling within the scaffold implant [27]. The success of
these may be a result of direct effects on cells involved in
bone formation, including osteoblasts [25] and osteoclasts
[28,29]; the effects of these scaffolds on the behaviour of
recruited macrophages are not known.
This study was designed to explore the response of primary
human macrophages in vitro to scaffolds that have been
previously shown to exhibit varying levels of success at
regenerating bone in vivo. We first evaluated the temporal
changes in gene expression of unactivated primary human
monocyte-derived macrophages seeded directly onto the
scaffolds (figure 1, study 1). Then, to determine if the mechan-
ism of macrophage modulation was dependent on release of
soluble factors from the scaffolds, we compared the response
of unactivated macrophages in direct contact or in transwell
co-culture with the scaffolds for 6 days (figure 1, study 2).
Finally, we completed a preliminary investigation of scaffold
grain size as a potential contributing factor to macrophage acti-
vation, because topographical and mechanical cues are known
to affect macrophage phenotype (figure 1, study 3). Macro-
phage response was evaluated in terms of gene expression
for a panel of markers that were previously determined to indi-
cate the M1, M2a and M2c phenotypes in vitro [20,22], because
of their distinct roles in promoting vascularization and tissue
repair, as well as those more generally associated with
angiogenesis and osteogenesis.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Fabrication of scaffolds
TCP–HA, baghdadite and Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds were pre-
pared
using
previously
described
methods
[24]
(see
also
electronic supplementary materials). To prepare baghdadite
scaffolds with two different grain sizes, the fabrication method
was identical to that for TCP–HA and Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds,
except a sintering temperature of 13808C for 3 h (small grain) or
12 h (large grain) was used. The porosity, compressive strength
and modulus, and microstructure of the scaffolds were characterized
as we have previously described [24,25].

stemming from physical scaffold properties and those resulting from ion dissolution. Study 3: grain size effects. The grain size of baghdadite scaffolds was varied and
the ensuing temporal response on macrophage protein secretion was assessed at early and late stages of contact. (Online version in colour.)

 2.2. Ion dissolution studies
A simulated body fluid (SBF) solution (pH 7.4) was prepared
according to the procedure described by Kokubo & Takadama
[30], and used to study the ion release profile of ceramic scaffolds.
Ion releasewas analysed for 28 days, even though cell culture exper-
iments were conducted for only 6 days, in an effort to thoroughly
characterize the scaffolds. Cubic-shaped scaffolds (8 � 8 � 8 mm)
were immersed in the SBF solution at 378C for 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and
28 days at a solid/liquid ratio of 150 mg l21 (n ¼ 5 per time
point). All scaffolds were held in plastic flasks and sealed. The con-
centration of ions in the solutions after soaking was tested using
inductively
coupled
plasma
atomic
emission
spectroscopy
(Optima 3000DV; Perkin Elmer, USA).
2.3. Monocyte isolation and macrophage culture
Primary human monocytes, isolated via negative selection from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were purchased from the
University of Pennsylvania Human Immunology Core (Philadel-
phia, PA). Monocytes were seeded in ultra-low attachment
flasks (Corning) and cultured for 5 days in RPMI 1640
medium,
supplemented
with
10%
heat-inactivated
human
serum, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 20 ng ml21 macrophage
colony stimulating factor (MCSF) for macrophage differentiation
in vitro as we have previously described [20,22]. The medium
was changed on day 3 and, on day 5, unactivated (M0)
macrophages were gently scraped and collected.
2.4. Temporal effects of scaffolds on macrophage
behaviour
All scaffolds were autoclaved and equilibrated in 24-well ultra-low
attachment plates in culture medium for 15 min. Unactivated M0
macrophages (1 � 106 cells) were seeded directly onto the scaffolds
in 15 ml and allowed to attach for 1 h at 378C and 5% CO2, as
described previously [31–33]. After 1 h, the culture medium was
adjusted to a final volume of 1 ml, and the samples were incubated
for an additional 2–6 days in the presence of 20 ng ml21 MCSF,
with medium exchange on days 2 and 3. M0 macrophages exposed
to culture medium alone served as a control. On days 2 and 6, the
scaffolds were transferred into 1 ml TRIzol and stored at 2208C
until RNA extraction. Control cells, not exposed to scaffolds
(M0), were gently scraped and collected, and centrifuged at 400g
for 7 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer RLT (RNeasy
Micro Kit; Qiagen), and stored at 2208C until RNA extraction.
Temporal studies investigating the effects of varying baghdadite
grain size on macrophage activation were conducted using the
same procedure; medium was collected on days 2, 3 and 6 and
stored at 2808C until analysis.
2.5. Indirect macrophage–scaffold interactions
To identify whether any soluble factors released from the scaffolds,
such as dissolved ions, affect macrophage gene expression, scaf-
folds were separated from the macrophages by placing them in
the apical chamber of transwell inserts (Millipore) in 24-well
ultra-low attachment plates in 250 ml culture medium. Unactivated
M0 macrophages (1 � 105 cells) were seeded in the basolateral
chamber in 750 ml of culture medium. The scaffolds and cells
were co-cultured in this way at 378C and 5% CO2 for 6 days,
with medium exchange on days 1 and 3. On day 6, cells were
lysed directly in the well in buffer RLT and stored at 2208C
overnight. All samples were cultured in medium containing
20 ng ml21 MCSF.
2.6. Quantitative analysis of gene expression using
RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from the scaffolds or cells, DNA was inacti-
vated with DNAse I and cDNA was prepared as we have
previously described [21]. Quantitative reverse transcription poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using 20 ng
cDNA and Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mean quantification
cycle (Cq) values were calculated from technical replicates (n ¼ 2).
The expression of target genes was then normalized to the reference
gene, GAPDH. Data shown represent the mean fold change+
s.e.m. (n � 4). Custom-designed primers (electronic supplementary
material, table S1) were synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific.
2.7. Principal component analysis
In order to visualize the global representation of gene expression
data and variation between samples resulting from macrophage–
scaffold interactions, principal component analysis (PCA) was
implemented using MATLABw software (The MathWorks, Inc.,
Natick, MA). PCA is a multivariate data analysis approach that
reduces the dimensionality of the data by capturing most of the
variation in the dataset into new variables known as principal com-
ponents [34]. Samples can then be projected onto these uncorrelated
principal components in order to detect similarities and dissimila-
rities among samples. Prior to analysis, the z-scores were computed
to standardize the data and enable comparison across the dataset.
The coefficients or loadings of each gene were used to identify
the genes most contributing to PCA results.
2.8. Combinatorial M1/M2 scoring
To quantify the relative gene expression of macrophages exposed
to TCP–HA, baghdadite or Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds, we com-
bined data from a panel of genes into a single score indicative
of the M1/M2 character of macrophages, using an algorithm
that we have recently shown to accurately predict healing of
human diabetic ulcers [35]. Briefly, the M1/M2 score was
defined as the ratio of the sum of the raw values of M1 gene
expression (TNF, VEGF, CCR7 and IL1B) to the sum of the raw
values of M2a gene expression (MRC1, PDGF and TIMP3),
such that higher scores represent increased pro-inflammatory
(M1-like) behaviour with respect to M2a behaviour.
2.9. Protein secretion
Conditioned media from cell–scaffold interactions, stored at
2808C following collection, were thawed on ice, centrifuged
briefly and analysed for the presence of protein using commer-
cially available kits. Human tumour necrosis factor (TNF),
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived
growth factor beta polypeptide (PDGFB) and bone morphogenetic
protein 2 (BMP2) mini ELISA development kits were purchased
from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human matrix metalloproteinase
7 (MMP7) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) Quantikine
ELISA kits were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis,
MN). TIMP metalloproteinase inhibitor 3 (TIMP3, MIG-5) human
ELISA kits were purchased from Abcamw (Cambridge, MA). All
kits were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Data are represented as mean+s.e.m. Prior to analysis, the fold
change in gene expression data was log-transformed, and statisti-
cal analysis for all studies was performed in GRAPHPAD PRISM
v. 6.0 (GRAPHPAD Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Data were analysed
using either two-way or one-way ANOVA, as indicated, with
Tukey’s post hoc analysis. A multiple t-test analysis was performed
rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org
J. R. Soc. Interface 13: 20160346
3
 on data collected from the grain size effects on macrophage
behaviour and statistical significance was determined using the
Holm–Sidak method. In all analyses, p , 0.01 was considered
significant to minimize the potential for false positives owing to
multiple testing.
3. Results
3.1. Scaffold properties
A summaryofthemechanicalproperties and ion releaseprofiles
for TCP–HA, baghdadite and Sr–HT–gahnite is provided
in figure 2. All scaffolds were approximately 82% porous; how-
ever, the unique microstructural design of Sr–HT–gahnite
yielded increased compressive strength and modulus, resem-
bling that of native bone [36], whereas TCP–HA scaffolds
were theweakest. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed
marked differences in the microstructures of the scaffolds
(figure 2b). Submicrometre crystals, owing to the presence of
gahnite and rectangular grains, were dispersed throughout
Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds. Crystal formation was absent from
baghdadite scaffolds. As expected, the average grain size and
sizedistribution ofsmallgrainbaghdadite(2 mm)wascompara-
tively much smaller than large grain baghdadite (4 mm). In
addition, the ion release profiles of baghdadite and Sr–HT–
gahnite were characteristic of their distinct compositions.
Baghdadite and Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds released comparable
levels of calcium ions; however, baghdadite released high levels
of silicon ions as well as phosphorus and zirconium, whereas
Sr–HT–gahnite dissolution medium contained only a fraction
of silicon and undetectable levels of phosphorus and zirconium.
3.2. Temporal effects of scaffolds on macrophage gene
expression
3.2.1. Principal component analysis and combinatorial scoring
Principal component 1 (PC1) retained 25.6% of the variance
within the gene expression set, and clustered the data based
on time (figure 3a). Interestingly, PC2 distinguished the M0 con-
trol on day 2 from all other macrophage responses, which
captured 20.9% of the variance in the data. Not surprisingly,
these results indicate that macrophages behave very differently
when cultured in three dimensions on ceramic scaffolds com-
pared with two-dimensional culture on ultra-low attachment
plastic. The leading drivers of the variance retained within
PC1 were MARCO, BGLAP, TNFSF11 and VCAN, whereas
MMP9, TGFB1, TIE1 and MMP7 were major contributors to
the variance of PC2 (coefficients of all genes projected onto the
principal components are provided inthe electronicsupplemen-
tary material, figure S1). Extending the analysis to PC3 and PC4,
which captured 14.3% and 9.7% of the variance, respectively,

 revealed scaffold type as the third largest source of variation in
the data (figure 3b). More specifically, PC3 separated macro-
phage interactions with baghdadite scaffolds from all other
groups at both time points. PC3 also separated macrophage
interactions with TCP–HA scaffolds from all other groups on
day 6. The genes most contributing to the variance of PC3 were
CD163, CCR7, VEGF and SPP1; genes driving the variance of
PC4 included CCL22, ALPL and TIMP3 (electronic supplemen-
tary material, figure S1). Importantly, these results show that
baghdadite scaffolds elicited different macrophage behaviour
from Sr–HT–gahnite, and both scaffolds were different in their
responses compared with TCP–HA scaffolds.
Intriguingly, baghdadite scaffolds resulted in a significant
reduction in the M1/M2a score over time (figure 3c), which
may suggest that these scaffolds promote a phenotypic
transition in macrophage behaviour. In contrast, TCP–HA
scaffolds appeared to promote prolonged pro-inflammatory
activation with an increasing M1/M2a score between days 2
and 6, which was significantly higher than all other groups.
However, given that PCA and combinatorial scores do not
allow thorough investigation into the contribution of each
gene to the results, we then evaluated each gene individually
to more thoroughly characterize the response of macrophages
to the scaffolds.
3.2.2. Temporal changes in gene expression
Analysis of expression levels of individual genes revealed inter-
esting differences between macrophages cultured on the
different scaffolds. Compared with the M0 control, TCP–HA
scaffolds caused upregulation of the pro-inflammatory M1 mar-
kers TNF at day 2, and VEGF and IL1B at day 6 (figure 4). CCR7
was downregulated at day 6 by macrophages on TCP–HA scaf-
folds. Baghdadite caused upregulation of TNF at day 2 and of
IL1B at day 6, with downregulation of VEGF at day 2 relative
to the M0 control. Sr–HT–gahnite caused upregulation of
TNF at day 2 and downregulation of CCR7 at day 6. Differences
in gene expression of M1 markers between scaffolds were also
noted, with baghdadite promoting higher expression of CCR7
and TNF than TCP–HA at day 2, which then returned to
baseline by day 6.
TCP–HA scaffolds promoted a significant downregulation
of all M2a markers at day 6 (figure 5), which was likely to be
the major contributing factor to the increasing M1/M2a score

and 6, with the exception of Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds at
day 2. Gene expression of M2a markers PDGFBB and TIMP3
was unaffected by baghdadite scaffolds at either time point,
but MRC1 was downregulated at day 6 relative to the M0
control. Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds promoted downregulation
of CCL22, MRC1 and TIMP3 at day 6. With respect to differ-
ences between scaffolds, macrophages cultured on TCP–HA
scaffolds expressed lower levels of three of the four M2a
markers than macrophages on baghdadite or Sr–HT–gahnite
scaffolds at both time points.
In addition to promoting downregulation of many M2a
markers, TCP–HA scaffolds also promoted downregulation
of several M2c markers at day 6 (CD163, MMP7, MMP9 and
SPP1) relative to the M0 control (figure 6). In contrast, baghda-
dite scaffolds promoted upregulation of two M2c markers at
day 6 (CD163 and VCAN), as well as downregulation of
MARCO at day 2 and MMP7 at day 6, although to a lesser
extent than TCP–HA. Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds promoted
downregulation of MMP7 and MMP9 at day 6, also to a
lesser extent than TCP–HA scaffolds. In general, macrophages
cultured on baghdadite scaffolds expressed higher levels of the
M2c genes than macrophages on the other scaffolds, especially
at the later time point.
Taken together, these results suggest that TCP–HA scaf-
folds
promote
the
highest
levels
of
M1-related
gene
expression, whereas baghdadite scaffolds promote a shift
towards M2c-related gene expression, especially at the later
time point. On the other hand, the only genes that showed
different trends in terms of direction of expression for bagh-
dadite and TCP–HA, relative to the M0 control, were CCR7
and CD163, and hybrid activation states that were not
distinctly M1 or M2 were observed for all scaffolds.
Further extending our analysis to genes more generally
related to bone repair revealed only minor changes in angio-
genic markers (TGFB1 and TIE1), and did not provide any
indication of osteoblast- or osteoclast-like behaviour (ALPL,
BGLAP
, RUNX2 and TNFSF11) induced by TCP–HA, baghda-
dite or Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds (electronic supplementary
material, figure S2).
3.3. Effects of soluble factors on macrophage response
3.3.1. Principal component analysis
Baghdadite, Sr–HT–gahnite and TCP–HA scaffolds have
different mechanical properties, microstructure and ion dissol-
ution profiles. As an initial step towards investigating why
macrophages behaved differently on each scaffold, we tested
the effects of released soluble factors on macrophage activation
by culturing the macrophages and scaffolds in separate
chambers of a transwell culture system. Again, we used PCA
to visualize the gene expression data, enabling us to identify
patterns and emphasize variation among the scaffolds.
Interestingly, PC1, PC2 and PC3 failed to separate macro-
phages cultured in the transwell system with any of the
scaffolds (figure 7a,b). These three principal components cap-
tured 88.1% of the variation in the data, suggesting that
soluble signals released from the scaffolds do not account for
differences in gene expression of macrophages.
3.3.2. Gene expression
Individual gene analysis revealed minor changes in gene
expression of CCL22, IL1B and MMP7 by macrophages cul-
tured in the transwell system with the scaffolds (figure 8
and electronic supplementary material, figure S3), in agreement
with the principal component analysis results.

 3.4. Grain size effects on macrophage response
Considering released factors had only minor effects on
macrophage gene expression, we next evaluated if changing
topography would affect macrophage behaviour by varying
the grain size within baghdadite scaffolds. We also used
protein secretion analysis instead of gene expression analysis
to confirm that macrophages secrete the protein products of
these genes at appreciable levels. While all proteins evaluated
were secreted at the expected levels based on previous
reports [20,21], varying baghdadite grain size between 2
and 4 mm had only a modest effect on macrophage behaviour
(electronic supplementary material, figure S4). For example,
macrophages cultured on larger grain baghdadite scaffolds
secreted slightly higher levels of TNF at day 2 (p , 0.05).
4. Discussion
In this study, we aimed to explore in vitro the response of
macrophages to bone substitutes that have been used with
varying degrees of success to repair critical-sized bone defects
in vivo. Overall, our findings suggest that different scaffold
chemistries differentially influence macrophage activation
in vitro, which we have also shown for materials used in
chronic wound care [33]. Changing activation states of
macrophages in response to implanted materials would be
expected to have profound effects on bone formation given
the importance of macrophages for bone repair [19].
While all scaffolds promoted upregulation of certain M1-
related genes, TCP–HA caused downregulation of M2a- and
M2c-related genes at both early and late time points, whereas
baghdadite scaffolds promoted higher levels of expression of
M2c-related genes, especially at the later time point. While
Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds did not have major effects on
macrophage behaviour relative to M0 controls, they did
promote higher levels of expression of several M2a- and
M2c-related genes relative to TCP–HA scaffolds. However,
it is important to note that the macrophage phenotypes
observed in this work in response to baghdadite, Sr–HT–
gahnite and TCP–HA scaffolds were hybrid activation states
that were not distinctly M1 or M2. Moreover, the fact that
many genes were regulated in the same direction and to similar
extents suggests that more studies are needed to confirm if
these changes correspond to functional differences. Neverthe-
less, the potential of these scaffolds to differentially regulate
macrophage behaviour may have important implications for
harnessing the natural healing ability of bone. Promoting
proper vascularization following injury is a major challenge
of tissue engineering strategies for fracture healing. Consider-
ing that the inflammatory response plays an important role
in stimulating angiogenesis and healing, and previous work
has demonstrated that sequential M1 and M2 macrophage
activation is required to support these processes [19,20],
scaffolds that promote early M1- and late M2-like activation
would also be expected to promote bone repair. Indeed, bagh-
dadite and Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds have been previously
shown to be more successful in promoting bone regeneration
in a critical-sized bone defect model in rabbits [24,25].
Interestingly, baghdadite scaffolds promoted upregula-
tion of many genes related to the M2c phenotype compared
with the M0 control. While the role of M2c macrophages in
tissue regeneration is still poorly understood, recent studies

 suggest that they are involved in tissue remodelling [22],
which plays an important role in bone repair. The fracture-
healing cascade involves the formation of a cartilaginous
fracture callus, mineralization and resorption of the callus,
and production of woven bone as the fracture site is revascu-
larized, which is later remodelled through a coordinated
process of bone resorption and formation to restore the
native tissue. Several studies have shown that the absence
of the tissue-remodelling enzyme, MMP9, following injury
delays endochondral ossification and alters healing [37,38].
Similarly, the absence of osteopontin, encoded by SPP1 and
believed to facilitate the uptake of mineralized matrix [39],
causes altered tissue remodelling in mice and, consequently,
reduced biomechanical properties [40].
Regulation of macrophage phenotype observed in this study
was attributed predominantly to direct interactions between
macrophages and the scaffolds, as only modest effects of scaf-
fold-released soluble factors on macrophage activation were
observed. Macrophage activation may be caused by a number
of factors, including ion dissolution, surface topography and
mechanical properties. The immunomodulatory effects of
metal ions such as titanium, zinc, zirconium and strontium are
now widely appreciated, resulting in a paradigm shift away
from inert bone substitutes [41]. In one study, conditioning
macrophages in b-tricalcium phosphate extracts increased the
osteogenicdifferentiationof mesenchymalstem cells,supporting
the role of macrophages in biomaterial-induced osteogenesis
[42]. Although the mechanisms behind metal ion-induced bone
regeneration are not well understood (reviewed in [43]), the pres-
ence of ions probably affects macrophages. Zirconia (in
baghdadite) has been shown to be pro-inflammatory [44],
whereas strontium and zinc (in Sr–HT–gahnite) have been
shown to affect bone remodelling [45,46] and promote
anti-inflammatory activity [47]. Future studies are focused on
determining whether the presence of these ions contributed to
the differential activation of macrophages observed in this work.

 Macrophage activation may also be affected by surface
topography. Previously, it was shown that macrophages
accumulated on rough but not smooth titanium surfaces,
though both led to bone formation in a rat subcuta-
neous model, suggesting differences in the mechanism of
healing [48]. Other studies have also demonstrated the role
of microstructure and surface topography in promoting
anti-inflammatory
behaviour
in
human
macrophages
[49–51]. In this work, we did find some effects of changing
grain size on the activation of macrophages on baghdadite
scaffolds, though the effects were modest. However, these
findings are limited to the small region of grain sizes tested
in this study and additional work is necessary to draw
conclusions
regarding
the
influence
of
grain
size
on
macrophage–baghdadite interactions. It is also possible that
grain size plays a role in macrophage responses to other
materials not investigated in this study. In future work, the
effects of surface topography on M1, M2a and M2c activation
will be explored in greater detail.
Lastly, macrophage activation could also be caused by
mechanical properties. To date, the effect of scaffold stiffness
on macrophage phenotype has been relatively underexplored
and remains unclear. Irwin et al. [52] attempted to shed light
on the ambiguous relationship between inflammatory cells
and substrate modulus using the THP-1 cell line, a human
monocytic cell line that can be differentiated into macrophages.
Although cells attached preferentially to stiffer substrates,
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines was variable. In con-
trast, another study found that stiffness of poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) substrates did not affect in vitro attachment of
RAW 264.7 macrophages; however, stiffer substrates promoted
pro-inflammatory gene expression in primary murine macro-
phages when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide [53]. More
recently, Guo et al. [54] showed that the modulus of poly(ester
urethane) scaffolds implanted subcutaneously in rats can be
tailored to modulate macrophage phenotype. Given the poten-
tial for the ceramic scaffolds investigated in this study to
modulate macrophage behaviour, future studies to specifically
isolate substrate modulus would be interesting.
There were several limitations to this study. Because of
the complexity of these scaffolds, we were not able to isolate
any one variable that contributes to modulation of macrophage
behaviour. Our goal was to explore the response of macro-
phages to different scaffolds in order to identify the most
promising areas for more detailed investigation in future
studies. Thus, subsequent work will focus on carefully defining
how changing scaffold ion content, topography and mechan-
ical properties affects macrophage activation, which could
have major effects on the design of scaffolds for bone regener-
ation. Another major limitation is that we evaluated only a
small subset of the thousands of genes involved in bone regen-
eration. Moreover, although gene expression has been shown
to be an excellent indicator of cell identity and physiological
state [55], especially for discerning macrophage activation
[56–58], additional work is needed to confirm phenotypic
changes in macrophages on a functional level. Finally, we
investigated only the effects of these scaffolds on macrophages,
but other immune cells, including dendritic cells and resident
tissue macrophages, as well as cells specific to bone repair,
would be expected to interact with macrophages and have
major effects on bone regeneration. In future studies, we plan
to explore the interactions between macrophages, activated
by bone substitutes, and other cells involved in the fracture-
healing cascade. Despite these limitations, this study suggests
that scaffold properties differentially activate macrophages,
and that, with further investigation, it may be possible to pro-
actively modulate macrophage behaviour using scaffold design.
5. Conclusion
In this work, we investigated the effects of pro-regenerative
scaffolds on macrophage behaviour. Overall, our findings
suggest that macrophage activation is influenced by scaffold
properties. To this end, we have shown that baghdadite and
Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds regulate macrophage phenotype dif-
ferently from TCP–HA scaffolds, which caused upregulation
of inflammatory (M1) genes and downregulation of M2
genes (both M2a and M2c), though hybrid activation states
were observed. While additional work is needed to confirm
these findings on a functional level, the ability of baghdadite
and Sr–HT–gahnite scaffolds to modulate macrophage behav-
iour would be expected to have important implications for
bone regeneration. In addition, we have demonstrated that
the ability of these scaffolds to regulate macrophage behaviour
is attributed to a combination of direct and indirect cell–
scaffold interactions, with direct interactions having the domi-
nant effects. Ultimately, improved understanding of the
interactions between scaffolds that regenerate bone in vivo
and cells of the inflammatory response will aid in the design
of biomaterials to facilitate bone repair and tissue regeneration.
