Abstract
The lack of effective and well-tolerated therapies against antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a
global public health problem leading to prolonged treatment and increased mortality. To
improve the efficacy of existing antibiotic compounds, we introduce a new method for strate-
gically inducing antibiotic hypersensitivity in pathogenic bacteria. Following the systematic
verification that the AcrAB-TolC efflux system is one of the major determinants of the intrin-
sic antibiotic resistance levels in Escherichia coli, we have developed a short antisense olig-
omer designed to inhibit the expression of acrA and increase antibiotic susceptibility in E.
coli. By employing this strategy, we can inhibit E. coli growth using 2- to 40-fold lower antibi-
otic doses, depending on the antibiotic compound utilized. The sensitizing effect of the anti-
sense oligomer is highly specific to the targeted gene’s sequence, which is conserved in
several bacterial genera, and the oligomer does not have any detectable toxicity against
human cells. Finally, we demonstrate that antisense oligomers improve the efficacy of anti-
biotic combinations, allowing the combined use of even antagonistic antibiotic pairs that are
typically not favored due to their reduced activities.

Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat. While genome sequencing and genetic
manipulation tools have elucidated many resistance mechanisms, these tools have not yet
been developed into successful therapeutics. One tool with such potential are peptide-con-

 RNA mimics that function as antisense mRNA translation inhibitors. In this paper we use
PPMOs to increase antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria. First, we identify the AcrAB-TolC
efflux system as a major intrinsic resistance mechanism in E. coli. Then by targeting the
mRNA of each component of this efflux system with PPMOs, we identify an acrA-PPMO
as the most effective antisense molecule. Treatment of bacteria with acrA-PPMO resulted
in a 2- to 40-fold increase in antibiotic efficacy, prevented translation of the AcrA protein,
and inhibited efflux of antibiotic molecules without being cytotoxic to human cells.
Finally, we demonstrate that acrA-PPMO is efficacious in several pathogenic bacterial gen-
era and enhances activity of both synergistic and antagonistic antibiotic pairs when used
together. This work establishes that PPMOs can potentially be used to treat infections
caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria.
Introduction
Antibiotic resistance is an important public health problem that emerged shortly after the dis-
covery of antibiotics [1,2]. Pathogenic bacteria are either intrinsically resistant to some antibi-
otics or they acquire resistance via spontaneous mutations or horizontal gene transfer. These
resistance mechanisms include deactivation or modification of antibiotics, pumping out antibi-
otics via efflux pumps, protection of antibiotic targets, and mutations in the target enzymes
that decrease antibiotic affinity [3]. Even though the majority of these resistance mechanisms
are well characterized at the molecular level, there has been limited success at avoiding the evo-
lution of resistance in the clinic. There is a growing need for entirely new tools and strategies in
order to stop or slow the evolution of antibiotic resistance in clinical settings [4].
Recent advances in biology, particularly whole genome sequencing technologies and gene-
editing tools, have enabled us to identify resistance-conferring genetic changes and perform
genetic manipulations that can reverse evolved antibiotic resistance [5–7]. By using novel
gene-editing tools such as CRISPR-CAS9 or engineered bacteriophages, it is now possible to
edit bacterial genomes to modulate antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria and also design sequence-
specific antimicrobials [8–10]. However, gene-editing tools are currently difficult to implement
given the practical and ethical problems with mutating bacterial genomes within an infected
human patient. Instead, we designed antisense oligomers, which target the mRNA of bacterial
resistance genes, preventing translation in a sequence-specific manner [11].
Briefly, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are synthetic nucleotide oligo-
mers made from six-membered morpholine rings joined together by phosphorodiamidate
linkages. Each morpholine ring has a natural nucleobase attached (see [12] for PMO struc-
ture), and the oligomers are designed to bind complementary sequences in targeted mRNAs.
PMOs are thought to exert their effects through translation inhibition as a result of steric hin-
drance when targeting bacterial mRNA within the close proximity of ribosome binding
sequences [13]. Cell-penetrating peptides are conjugated to the phosphorodiamidate morpho-
lino oligomers (PPMOs), which enhance uptake of the oligomer into the bacterial cell [14].
Unlike short RNA molecules, which are also being considered as therapeutic agents, the syn-
thetic PMO backbone renders them resistant to being hydrolyzed by nucleases [12,15]. Previ-
ous reports have shown PPMOs to be bactericidal in vitro and in vivo in a number of gram-
negative pathogens when targeting essential genes [11,16]. Here, we demonstrate that PPMOs
inhibit several resistance-conferring genes, improving efficacy of several distinct antibiotic
classes.

 Results
Active excretion of antibiotic molecules via efflux proteins or reducing the uptake of drug mol-
ecules by mutating or down-regulating membrane proteins (i.e., porins) are two of the com-
mon strategies that multidrug-resistant bacteria utilize in order to render antibiotics ineffective
[3]. We, and others, have previously shown that several genes that encode membrane proteins
in multidrug-resistant E. coli strains either accumulated point mutations or had changes in
their regulation [5,17–20]. Thus, we hypothesized that deletion of such genes has the potential
to increase antibiotic efficacy (Fig 1A). To test this idea, we selected five genes (acrB, emrB,
marB, ompF, cmr) that encode membrane proteins in E. coli and deleted them with all 32 possi-
ble combinations in order to find the best target genes and quantify epistatic interactions
between these gene deletions (S1 Fig) [3,21–24]. We then measured the minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) of these mutants against 27 different antibiotics (Fig 1B and 1C and S2
Fig). Deletion of acrB, alone or in combination with other genes, significantly increased the
susceptibility of E. coli to several antibiotics, up to ~100-fold (Fig 1B and 1C and S2 Fig).

 However, deletions of the other genes (emrB, marB, ompF, cmr) did not significantly change
antibiotic susceptibility (Fig 1B and 1C and S2 Fig). This suggests that these genes might be
involved in acquired resistance when they are mutated or their regulation is altered, but they
are not involved in intrinsic antibiotic resistance of E. coli against the 27 compounds we tested.
Also, based on these measurements, there were no epistatic interactions between these gene
deletions.
The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump complex is among the best-characterized efflux pumps in E.
coli and is composed of AcrB, the inner membrane antiporter, AcrA, the periplasmic adaptor
protein, and TolC, the outer membrane channel (Fig 2A) [20,22,25–27]. Deleting acrB led to
increased susceptibility (Fig 1B and 1C), so we deleted the two other genes (acrA and tolC) that
together form the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump complex (Fig 2A) in E. coli to identify their contri-
bution to the intrinsic antibiotic resistance of E. coli. Indeed, deletion of any of these three
genes increased antibiotic sensitivity of E. coli, and loss of intrinsic antibiotic resistance due to
gene deletions was reversed by plasmid complementation (S3 Fig).
We designed three PPMOs to target the acrA, acrB, and tolC genes, respectively (Fig 2A–
2C). PPMOs were designed as 11-mers targeting gene regions near the translation start site
with high-sequence specificity and low homology around other translation start sites in the E.
coli genome (Fig 2C). We first tested the efficacy of these PPMOs by quantifying inhibitory

with their translation. Silencing resistance-conferring genes with this strategy leads to antibiotic susceptibility. (C) We have engineered
three separate PPMOs in order to target the acrA (blue), acrB (magenta), and tolC (green) genes. These PPMOs target gene regions that
span the start codons of the transcribed mRNA. Alignment of the acrA, acrB, and tolC genes of different bacterial genera demonstrate that
the PPMO sequences, designed for E. coli, are also complementary in other pathogens. The overlapping nucleotides between the gene
sequences and the PPMOs are highlighted in color. The PPMO sequences are homologous in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella
enterica genes but have limited homology to the remaining bacterial species. (D) Growth of bacteria is quantified by calculating the area

 effects of several antibiotic compounds against E. coli in the presence of PPMOs (Fig 2E, S4
Fig, S2 Table). All three PPMOs designed to target acrA, acrB, and tolC (hereafter called
acrA-PPMO, acrB-PPMO, and tolC-PPMO) induced antibiotic sensitivity to multiple antibi-
otics, while a control PPMO (control-PPMO), which has a base sequence with low homology
to E. coli translation start sites, had no effect on antibiotic sensitivity (Fig 2E and S4 Fig). Fig
2E demonstrates an example of this sensitizing effect with clindamycin, a protein synthesis
inhibitor that is not commonly used against E. coli infections because of its high MIC.
Enhancing the efficacy of clindamycin against E. coli is a significant finding that could make
this drug potentially effective against gram-negative bacteria. Strikingly, use of acrA-PPMO
(Fig 2E, blue line) showed a ~16-fold increase in clindamycin sensitivity comparable to the
~32-fold increase from deletion of the acrA gene (Fig 2E, cyan line). In almost every PPMO
and antibiotic combination, the effects of acrB-PPMO and tolC-PPMO were less potent than
the effect of acrA-PPMO (S4 Fig). Hence, we used acrA-PPMO for the rest of our experi-
ments. The sensitization effect of acrA-PPMO varied between a 2- and 40-fold reduction in
MIC, depending on the antibiotic compound (S4 Fig, S2 Table). It was surprising to find that,
for certain antibiotic compounds, acrA-PPMO treatment did not adequately recapitulate the
effect seen with the acrA deletion mutant (e.g., compare chloramphenicol and oxacillin,
S4 Fig).
In order to further compare the phenotypic effects of the acrA deletion mutant to acrA-
PPMO silencing, we tested the sensitization effect of acrA-PPMO with ten antibiotic com-
pounds (Fig 3B). Five of these compounds were selected because they were more potent against
E. coli strains with the acrA gene deletion, and the remaining five antibiotic compounds were
selected since their efficacies were not expected to change based on the acrA gene deletion data
(S2 Fig). Fig 3A presents two example antibiotic dose-response curves demonstrating the effect
of acrA-PPMO when used together with cefotaxime or meropenem. Susceptibility of E. coli to
cefotaxime increased when acrA was deleted or silenced (Fig 3A, left), whereas susceptibility to
meropenem remained the same as the wild-type when acrA was deleted or silenced (Fig 3A,
right). This pattern was consistent with the previous susceptibility data in all antibiotics tested
(Fig 3B). In other words, the phenotypic effect of silencing the acrA gene with acrA-PPMO was
indistinguishable from the phenotypic effect of acrA deletion (r = 0.94, p < 0.001, Pearson cor-
relation test).
The nucleotide sequence near the translational start site is conserved between several bac-
terial genera for acrA (Fig 2C). We therefore hypothesized that acrA-PPMO would sensitize
organisms with high sequence homology and would have no effect on organisms with low
sequence homology. To demonstrate this, we compared the efficacy of acrA-PPMO against
E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cenocepacia, which share between 36% and 100% acrA
sequence homology to the E. coli target sequence (Fig 2C). In E. coli, time-kill assays after
18 h of exposure to subinhibitory concentrations (1/4 MIC) of piperacillin-tazobactam and
10 μM acrA-PPMO resulted in a three order of magnitude reduction in colony forming units
(CFUs) from the starting inoculum compared to a three order of magnitude increase at the
same concentration of antibiotic alone (Fig 3C). We demonstrated a similar sensitization
effect of acrA-PPMO against K. pneumoniae and S. enterica, which share 100% sequence
homology with E. coli (Fig 3C, top). Conversely, the acrA-PPMO had no activity against A.
baumannii, P. aeruginosa, or B. cenocepacia, consistent with their lower (36%–45%) sequence
homology (Fig 3C, bottom). Importantly, this demonstrated that the sensitization effect of
acrA-PPMO was sequence-specific, and our strategy has the potential for being used against
other pathogens.

 We quantified the AcrA protein expression in E. coli in increasing concentrations of acrA-
PPMO (Fig 4A, top panel). AcrA protein levels decreased nearly 30-fold at acrA-PPMO con-
centrations greater than 3 μM (Fig 4A, middle panel). Control-PPMO had no effect on AcrA
protein levels at 2 and 10 μM (S5 Fig). Residual expression of AcrA (~2% compared to
untreated cells) is still detected even at the highest acrA-PPMO dose. We have also verified this
effect by measuring growth rates of E. coli at different subinhibitory clindamycin concentra-
tions using increasing concentrations of acrA-PPMO. Growth of E. coli, incubated with con-
stant clindamycin concentrations, gradually decreased as acrA-PPMO concentration was
increased (Fig 4A, bottom panel). This indicated that clindamycin susceptibility was correlated
with the AcrA expression in E. coli (Fig 4A). Clindamycin sensitivity of E. coli, even at the high-
est concentrations of acrA-PPMO, was still lower than the sensitivity of the E. coli mutant with
acrA deletion (Fig 4A, bottom panel), which is consistent with the residual AcrA expression
even at the highest concentrations of acrA-PPMO (Fig 4A, top panel). To directly demonstrate
that the acrA-PPMO’s inhibition of AcrA translation leads to reduced antibiotic efflux, we
measured efflux of a DNA-binding dye, Hoechst 33342, which is also a substrate for the
AcrAB-TolC complex [28]. The rate of fluorescence accumulation inside bacterial cytoplasm
reflects the difference between concentration-dependent influx of Hoechst dye and the
AcrAB-TolC-related efflux of the Hoechst dye. We found that E. coli cells treated with 2 and
10 μM of acrA-PPMO had significant increases in final fluorescence levels and fluorescence
accumulation rates, comparable to the acrA deletion mutant (S6 Fig). This surrogate measure
suggests that the efflux of antibiotic compounds is qualitatively similar to the efflux of the
Hoechst dye; however, the magnitude of efflux will be specific to the chemical structure of par-
ticular antibiotics. Finally, we tested the toxicity of acrA-PPMO against human lung epithelial
cells using a cell viability assay (Fig 4B). Even at 19.2 μM, acrA-PPMO had no significant toxic-
ity at the end of 4 d. These observations provide clear evidence that acrA-PPMO is a promising
agent that works as an efficient antibiotic adjuvant by preventing AcrA translation and there-
fore preventing efflux in a sequence-specific way.
One strategy often employed for treatment of severe bacterial infections is the combined use
of two or more antibiotics with different mechanisms of action [29]. Particularly, the use of
antibiotic pairs that display synergy is considered to be advantageous in clinical practice
[30,31]. One risk of this approach is that several synergistic antibiotic pairs may promote evo-
lution of multidrug resistance if they have overlapping resistance mechanisms [5,32,33]. Con-
versely, several antibiotic pairs that are less likely to promote resistance cannot be used in
combination due to antagonistic drug—drug interactions [5,30]. Therefore, strategies that
could rescue the use of antagonistic drug combinations could be of significant benefit [34]. Suc-
cessfully enhancing antibiotic susceptibility by blocking efflux activity has three potential out-
comes in antibiotic combination therapies (Fig 5A). It could increase susceptibility to either
antibiotic independently (Fig 5A, left and middle), or it could increase susceptibility to both
drugs simultaneously (Fig 5A, right). We tested the acrA-PPMO together with antibiotic pairs
to see if we could improve their antimicrobial efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that sensitizing
bacteria against antibiotics by targeting acrA with the acrA-PPMO can increase sensitivity to
both synergistic and antagonistic pairs. We quantified pairwise interactions between trimetho-
prim and sulfamethoxazole versus trimethoprim and piperacillin-tazobactam, in the presence
and absence of acrA-PPMO (Fig 5B). Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are antifolate anti-
biotics that block the activity of dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase, respec-
tively. Trimethoprim is often used together with sulfamethoxazole due to their synergistic
interaction [30]. Conversely, using trimethoprim with piperacillin-tazobactam could be prob-
lematic since these two drugs were previously reported to antagonize each other’s activities
[30]. We created two-dimensional gradients of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Fig 5B, left)

 or trimethoprim-piperacillin/tazobactam (Fig 5B, right) and determined MIC values for the
wild-type E. coli in the presence (Fig 5B, blue lines) and absence of acrA-PPMO (Fig 5B, black
lines) or with the acrA deletion (Fig 5B, cyan lines). We compared the enhancement of drug
combinations by acrA-PPMO by integrating the AUC of the resulting MIC curves (Fig 5C).
We found that acrA-PPMO increases the efficacy of both synergistic and antagonistic pairs by
nearly 5-fold and 15-fold for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Fig 5C, left) and trimethoprim-
piperacillin/tazobactam combinations (Fig 5C, right), respectively. This observation clearly
indicates that even though trimethoprim and piperacillin-tazobactam have antagonistic inter-
actions, acrA-PPMO significantly (p < 0.001) increases the efficacy of the trimethoprim-piper-
acillin-tazobactam combination in E. coli. This finding has the potential of making the
trimethoprim-piperacillin-tazobactam combination a promising candidate for treating infec-
tions since trimethoprim and piperacillin-tazobactam have independent resistance mecha-
nisms that make the emergence of cross-resistance less likely [5,7]. PPMO treatment did not
change the shape of the MIC curves for both of the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Fig 5B,
left) and trimethoprim-piperacillin/tazobactam (Fig 5B, right) combinations, but rather
rescaled the MIC curves towards the origin compared to the wild type (Fig 5B), as was previ-
ously demonstrated for other antibiotics by Chait et al. [34]. We conclude that the acrA-PPMO
did not affect the drug interaction mechanisms, but rather, the decreased efflux of both antibi-
otic compounds resulted in increased effective antibiotic concentrations inside bacterial cells.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that we can strategically induce antibiotic hypersensitivity in
pathogenic bacteria by targeting the genes that encode for the AcrAB-TolC efflux system with
PPMOs. Antibiotic molecules that traverse the bacterial membrane can therefore remain intra-
cellular for longer time periods leading to increased antibiotic activity. This could have also
been achieved by using efflux pump inhibitor molecules, such as phenyl-arginine-β-naphthyla-
mide, that block AcrAB-TolC activity [35–39]. However, efflux pump inhibitors are known to
have significant toxicities and currently have limited use as therapeutic agents [35,36]. The
method we introduced for inducing antibiotic hypersensitivity with the use of PPMOs does not
exhibit cytotoxicity in the human cell line we tested and does not require editing the genome of
the targeted bacteria in the human host. There are several advantages associated with increas-
ing antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens by using PPMOs. First, though this is an in vitro dem-
onstration, it suggests the potential of using lower doses of existing antibiotics, which may lead
to fewer adverse effects of those agents. Second, being able to sensitize a specific bacterial path-
ogen and inhibit its growth by lower antibiotic doses could have the potential to minimally per-
turb beneficial members of healthy human microbiota. Third, by using PPMOs, we may have
the opportunity to use several drugs for treating infections against which they are normally not
effective, such as oxacillin against gram-negative bacteria (Fig 3B and S4 Fig). Finally, increas-
ing antibiotic efficacy with PPMOs may change the way we typically design combinatorial anti-
biotic therapies: by using PPMOs to minimize the antibiotic doses necessary in antibiotic
combinations, we may be able to use antibiotic pairs even if the two drugs somewhat dampen
each other’s inhibitory effects. However, pharmacokinetics of PPMOs and potential antibiotic

 combinations should be considered when designing combination therapies for maximum anti-
microbial activity [40]. In addition to the benefits described above, the sequence-specificity of
PPMOs allows for the ability to target a single genus, or multiple genera, if the PMO target
sequence is conserved (Fig 3C). As we have previously reported in Burkholderia, significant
reductions in efficacy (> 8-fold) can occur with even single base mismatches in the PMO
sequence [11]. Additionally, Tilley et al. demonstrated that four silent mutations were sufficient
to render a targeted PMO ineffective in E. coli [41]. However, the relationship between mis-
matches, including number and where they occur spatially in the oligomer sequence, and
impact on efficacy have not been thoroughly described and warrant future study.
We conclude that targeting resistance genes with PPMOs is a plausible strategy to increase
antibiotic susceptibility in pathogenic bacteria. Further studies are needed to extend our in
vitro experiments to animal models of infection to bridge the gap between our in vitro experi-
ments and translational studies in humans. Utilizing sequence-specific PPMOs that do not
have antimicrobial activity when used alone has the potential advantage of avoiding classic
selection pressure exhibited by traditional antimicrobials. Importantly, acquired bacterial resis-
tance to PPMOs has thus far only been described in the context of PPMOs designed against
essential genes and was found to be related to the peptide moiety and not the oligomer
sequence [42]. Attachment of a different peptide to the same oligomer was able to rescue
PPMO activity, indicating possible paths towards dealing with the development of resistance.
Given the narrow pipeline for new antibiotics and the increasingly urgent worldwide problem
of antibiotic resistance, innovative therapeutic approaches such as utilizing PPMOs could serve
an important medical need in the future. Future studies will be conducted to systematically test
the strategies we propose in this paper in preclinical in vivo models to bridge the gap between
in vitro experiments and human studies.
Materials and Methods
Growth Media and Strains
Bacterial cells were grown at 37°C in M9 minimal medium (248510, Difco) supplemented with
0.4% glucose (50-99-7, Fisher Scientific) and 0.2% amicase (82514, Sigma), if not stated other-
wise. All E. coli strains were wild type K-12 derivatives of the parent strain BW25113. The dele-
tion strains were generated using the Keio Collection [43]; ΔacrA, ΔacrB, Δcmr, ΔemrB,
ΔmarB, ΔompF, ΔtolC were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center with stock codes
11843, 8609, 8865, 10099, 9314, 8925, 11430, respectively. These strains were used for making
P1 lysates and generating mutant strains with multiple gene deletions by P1 phage transduction
[44]. Kanamycin resistance marker genes were removed after every cloning step [43,45].
Antibiotic Compounds
The antibiotics used in this study are: Ampicillin (A1593, Sigma-Aldrich), Carbenicillin
(C3416, Sigma-Aldrich), Cefotaxime (454950050, Acros Organics), Cefoxitin (C4786, Sigma-
Aldrich), Chloramphenicol (C0378, Sigma-Aldrich), Ciprofloxacin (F17850, Sigma),
tazobactam for wild type E. coli (black line), with 10 μM acrA-PPMO (blue line), or the acrA deletion mutant
(cyan line). (C) Bar graphs demonstrating the efficacy of antibiotic combinations shown in (B). Area under the
MIC curves in (B) are significantly reduced relative to the wild type E. coli (bars with black diagonal lines) for
both antibiotic combinations when 10 μM acrA-PPMO (blue bars) is used or acrA (cyan bars) is physically
deleted. All measurements were done in triplicate, and p-values for significance were calculated with
Student’s t-test.

ers’ instructions.
PPMOs Used for Targeting Efflux Genes
PMOs were synthesized as previously described [46]. The cell-penetrating peptide (RXR)4XB,
where R is arginine, X is aminohexanoic acid, and B is beta-alanine, was synthesized using stan-
dard FMOC chemistry and purified to >95% purity at CPC Scientific (Sunnyvale, CA) and
used without further purification. The peptide was conjugated to the nitrogen of a piperadine
ring at the 50-terminus of the PMO. First, a C-terminally reactive peptide-benzotriazolyl ester
was prepared by dissolving the peptide acid with O-(Benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethy-
luronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP). The concentration of
the peptide was 50 mM. Diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) was added to the peptide solution at
molar ratios of peptide acid:TBTU:DIEA of 1.0:1.5:1.5, respectively. Immediately after the addi-
tion of DIEA, the peptide solution was added to a DMSO solution containing the PMO (20
mM) at a 1:0.8 molar ratio. After stirring at 25°C for 3 h, the reaction was stopped by adding a
4-fold volumetric excess of water. 1 M H3PO4 was added to crude conjugated PMO in 50 μL ali-
quots until pH 3 was reached. After stirring at 25°C for 30 min, the reaction was neutralized by
adding 1 M Na2HPO4 in 100 μL aliquots until pH 7 was reached. The resulting solution was
loaded onto a Source 30s (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) column. The unconjugated PMO and other
reaction products were purified by elution with a 1.5 M Guanidine-HCl solution in 20 mM
NaH2PO4 with 25% MeCN in Milli-Q water at pH 6.5 from 0%–50% over 12 columns volumes.
Fractions were selected and pooled based on UV absorbance. Pooled fractions were diluted by
adding a 5-fold volumetric excess of water and the conjugate/salt solution was then loaded onto
a SPE column (Amberchrom CG300M, Dow Chemicals, MI), which was subsequently washed
three times with two-column volumes of water to remove salt. Finally, the (RXR)4XB—PMO
conjugate was eluted off the SPE column with two-column volumes of 50% MeCN and lyophi-
lized. The final products were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of
flight mass spectrometry and HPLC. The purities of the final products were >85%. The nucleo-
tide sequence for the control-PPMO is ATCGTTGCATC, for acrA-PPMO is GTTCATATGT
A, for acrB-PPMO is TAGGCATGTCT, and for tolC-PPMO is TTCATTTGCAT.
MIC Determinations
Master plates of each bacterial strain were prepared in a 96-well plate format using overnight
cultures in ~15% glycerol (~5 x 108 CFU/mL) and stored at −80°C. The master plates were
thawed prior to experiments and then used to inoculate the antibiotic plates with a pinner (VP
Scientific, VP409), which transfers ~5 x 104 CFUs into each well containing ~200 μL of growth
media. MIC values were determined using either end-point (final OD600) analysis or calculat-
ing the AUC [47]. Briefly, for end-point MIC determination (Figs 1 and 3 and S2 and S3 Figs),
the 96-well plates were incubated for 22 h in a shaker operated at 37°C and then OD600 of

 each plate was measured using a plate reader (Infinite M200 Pro, Tecan). For each strain and
antibiotic pair, the MIC value was defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration at which the
final OD600 was below ~0.04 after background correction, which is slightly above the lower
detection limit of our plate reader. Preliminary experiments were conducted with four repli-
cates for clindamycin and fusidic acid. The remaining antibiotics were run twice with biological
replicates. A Pearson correlation coefficient test was used to confirm the repeatability of the
measurements and the p-values for MIC reduction significance were calculated using Wilcoxon
rank sum test. For MIC determination using AUC values, plates were incubated under similar
environmental conditions, but in an automated robotic system so that OD600 of growing cul-
tures were recorded as a function of time (Fig 2D and 2E). Linear interpolations of the resulting
growth curves (OD600 versus time, Fig 2D) were then integrated to calculate the AUC as a
metric for growth using a custom MATLAB code (r2016a, MathWorks). MIC values were
defined as the concentration of antibiotic where the AUC was reduced by at least 95% com-
pared to the AUC without antibiotic. Although both methods gave qualitatively similar results,
we used the AUC method whenever possible because it is more robust to experimental noise
[47].
Time-Kill Assay of Piperacillin/Tazobactam with AcrA PPMO
E. coli BW25113, K. pneumoniae F45153 (clinical urine isolate), S. enterica enterica serovar
Typhimurium 14028S (a generous gift from Dr. Sebastian Winter, UTSW Medical Center), A.
baumannii AYE, P. aeruginosa PAO1, and B. cenocepacia complex K56-2 (cystic fibrosis clini-
cal isolate) were grown overnight in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton II broth (MHII, Becton,
Dickinson and Co., Sparks, MD) at 37°C, 220 rpm. Cultures were diluted to 5 x 105 CFU/mL in
fresh MHII and incubated with 2-fold dilutions of piperacillin/tazobactam alone or in combi-
nation with 10 μM control-PPMO or acrA-PPMO in a 96-well plate and incubated for 18 h at
37°C, 220 rpm. Growth controls included H2O, 10 μM control-PPMO, and 10 μM acrA-PPMO
alone. The MIC was evaluated at 18 h using the final optical density values as described above;
for reference, the MIC values were 4, 2, 2, 128, 4, and 64 μg/mL for E. coli BW25113, K. pneu-
moniae F45153, S. enterica 14028S, P. aeruginosa PAO1, A. baumannii AYE, and B. cenocepa-
cia K56-2, respectively. Growth controls and wells at 1-, 0.5-, and 0.25-fold the MIC of
piperacillin/tazobactam alone or in combination with PPMO were serially diluted in PBS and
plated on trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood (Remel, Lenexa, KS) for CFU enumeration.
Experiments were performed with at least four replicates. Experiments with some of the strains
were carried out with six or nine replicates, because the dose-response curves of piperacillin-
tazobactam are very steep in general and it is difficult to precisely measure MIC values with
2-fold dilutions.
Quantifying AcrA Expression with Western Blots
Western blots measuring AcrA levels after PPMO addition (1 to 12 μM) were performed fol-
lowing standard procedures using an AcrA antibody (1:30,000; generous gift from Dr. Helen I.
Zgurskaya, University of Oklahoma) and cAMP receptor protein antibody (1:1,000; BioLegend:
664304). E. coli cells (BW25113) were grown overnight, and final OD600 was adjusted to unity.
These cells were then diluted by 104 fold in 5 mL of M9 minimal media (supplemented with
0.4% glucose and 0.2% amicase) and grown for 6 h at 37°C (220 rpm) in the presence of increas-
ing acrA-PPMO concentrations (1–12 μM final concentration). Cells were then washed three
times with cold PBS buffer (pH 7.4), and bacterial pellets were lysed in 1X Laemmli sample
buffer (5 mL/O.D.). Equivalent amounts of the cell lysates (10 μL of the above sample) from
each set were electrophoresed in a 4%–15% precast polyacrylamide gel (561081; BIO-RAD),

 and western blotting was performed following standard procedures. IR-labeled secondary anti-
bodies (IRDye 800CW (926–32213) and IRDye 680RD (925–68072); Li-COR) were used for
detection. AcrA protein amount was quantified using an ODYSSEY infrared imaging system
(LI-COR).
Efflux Inhibition Assay
E. coli (BW25113) and the acrA gene deletion E. coli strain were grown overnight, and final
OD600 was adjusted to unity. The cells were then diluted by 103-fold in M9 minimal media
(with 0.4% glucose and 0.2% amicase) and grown for 6 h at 37°C (100 rpm) in the presence of
0, 2, and 10 μM acrA-PPMO concentrations until the OD600 reached ~0.25. The cells were
washed twice in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and were diluted to a final OD600 of 0.2 and 0.4 (three
replicates for each cell density). Hoechst 33342 dye (Thermo Fisher, 62249) was then added to
final dye concentration of 10 μM in a 96-well plate. Fluorescence and OD600 measurements
were immediately recorded every ~75 s for 10 h (S6A Fig). Fluorescence of Hoechst 33342 was
measured by excitation at 361 nm and emission centered at 497 nm. Fluorescence values were
corrected by subtracting fluorescence of PPMOs mixed with Hoechst 33342 dye in the absence
of bacterial cells. This step was crucial, since acrA-PPMO produced significant fluorescence
due to its AT-rich sequence yielding high fluorescence quantum yield for the Hoechst 33342
dye. Fluorescence intensity (FI) values were normalized with the optical density of bacterial
cultures. Fluorescence accumulation rates were calculated by fitting a line to the normalized FI
values that were recorded within the first 5–10 min of the experiment when FI linearly
increases (S6B and S6C Fig). Final FI levels were calculated by averaging fluorescence within a
time window where fluorescence and OD values remain constant (S6D Fig).
Cloning and Expression of Rescue Plasmids Carrying Efflux Genes
For reversing the antibiotic sensitivity phenotype of E. coli with efflux gene deletions, we cloned
acrA, acrB, and tolC genes into the arabinose inducible pJMK001 plasmid (Addgene) and
introduced them into gene deletion strains. The efflux pump genes (acrA, acrB, and tolC) were
PCR amplified from the wild type (BW25113) E. coli strain using the following primer sets
(acrA-forward: CATGCCATGGGGATGAACAAAAACAGAGGGTTTACG, acrA-reverse:
AGCTTTGTTTAAACTTAAGACTTGGACTGTTCAGGCTG); (acrB-forward: CATCAGTC
ATGATGCCTAATTTCTTTATCGATCG, acrB-reverse: AGCTTTGTTTAAACTCAATGAT
GATCGACAGTATG) and (tolC-forward: CATGCCATGGGGATGAAGAAATTGCTCCCC
ATTC; tolC-reverse: AGCTTTGTTTAAACTCAGTTACGGAAAGGGTTATGA). These frag-
ments were cloned into pJMK001 after restriction digestion (NcoI and PmeI) followed by liga-
tion. These plasmids were then transformed into E. coli strains that had relevant gene
deletions. For expression of the efflux genes, bacterial cultures with and without plasmids were
grown in the presence of 0.2% arabinose in M9 minimal medium.
Supporting Information
S1 Fig. Single and combinatorial gene deletions were verified by PCR amplification of the
chromosomal regions that span the genes of interest. The approximate PCR product sizes are
3 kb, 1.2 kb, 200 b, 1.5 kb, and 1 kb for acrB (ΔA), cmr (ΔC), marB (ΔM), emrB (ΔE), and ompF
(ΔO), respectively. As can be seen from the gel images, we also deleted marA (ΔR) and tolC (ΔT)
alone and in combination with select genes. We did not perform further deletions in combina-
tion with marA or tolC since the phenotypic effect of marA deletion did not have a significant
effect on antibiotic resistance, and tolC deletion was indistinguishable from the deletion of acrB.

the 27 tested antibiotic compounds. All measurements were done in at least duplicate. Mea-
surements with the wild-type strain were done with eight replicates. Measurements with clin-

nonsignificant changes in efficacy. Intensities of the blue and red colors indicate the magnitude
of efficacy changes. The actual MIC values can be found in S1 Table. (B) MIC measurements of
the gene deletion strains across duplicates were highly reproducible. The Pearson correlation

AcrA protein levels.

AcrAB-TolC system. We measured the influx of Hoechst 33342 into E. coli cells by recording
fluorescence and OD600 values of bacterial cultures. Note that influx of the dye molecules
reflects the difference between concentration-dependent dye influx and AcrAB-TolC-related
dye efflux. All measurements were done in six replicates, and fluorescence values were normal-
ized by the OD600 of the corresponding cultures. (A) Fluorescence created by the addition of
10 μM Hoechst 33342 dye was recorded for 10 h. All values are normalized with respect to the
mean FI values of the untreated wild-type E. coli cells (black line) recorded during the last 5 h
when fluorescence remain unchanged. Fluorescence of wild type E. coli cells treated with the
control-PPMO (gray dashed line) was similar to fluorescence of untreated wild type E. coli cells
(black line). Fluorescence of acrA-PPMO-treated cells (2 μM acrA-PPMO: blue dashed line;
and 10 μM acrA-PPMO: blue continuous line) and the acrA deletion cells (cyan line) reached

 slightly higher fluorescence levels at a higher initial rate. (B) Fluorescence measurements
within the first 20 min (shown in A) demonstrate that the net influx rate of the Hoechst 33342
dye increases if acrA is deleted (cyan lines) or silenced (blue lines). This increase reflects the
