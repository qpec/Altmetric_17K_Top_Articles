ABSTRACT 341 WORDS   
23 
Importance Due to the susceptibility of observational studies to confounding and reverse 
24 
causation, the causal direction and magnitude of the association between telomere length and 
25 
incidence of cancer and non-neoplastic diseases is uncertain. 
26 
Objective To appraise the causal relevance of telomere length for risk of cancer and non-
27 
neoplastic diseases using germline genetic variants as instrumental variables.  
28 
Data Sources Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) published up to January 15 2015.  
29 
Study Selection GWAS of non-communicable diseases that assayed germline genetic 
30 
variation and did not select cohort or control participants on the basis of pre-existing diseases. 
31 
Of 163 GWAS of non-communicable diseases identified, 103 shared data for our study. 
32 
Data Extraction Summary association statistics for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
33 
that are strongly associated with telomere length in the general population.     
34 
Main Outcomes Odds ratios (ORs) for disease per 1-SD higher telomere length due to 
35 
germline genetic variation. 
36 
Results Summary data were available for 35 cancers and 47 non-neoplastic diseases, 
37 
corresponding to 409,819 cases (median 2,092 per disease) and 1,404,633 controls (median 
38 
7,738 per disease). Increased telomere length due to germline genetic variation was generally 
39 
associated with increased risk for site-specific cancers. The strongest associations were 
40 
observed for (ORs per 1-SD change in genetically longer telomeres): glioma 5.27  (3.15, 
41 
8.81), serous low malignant potential ovarian cancer 4.35 (2.39-7.94); lung adenocarcinoma 
42 
3.19 (2.40-4.22); neuroblastoma 2.98 (1.92-4.62); bladder cancer 2.19 (1.32-3.66); melanoma 
43 
1.87 (1.55, 2.26); testicular cancer 1.76 (1.02-3.04); kidney cancer 1.55 (1.08-2.23); and 
44 
endometrial cancer 1.31 (1.07-1.61). Associations with cancer were stronger for rarer cancers 
45 
and tissue sites with lower rates of stem cell division (P<0.05). There was generally little 
46 
  
3 
evidence of association between genetically longer telomeres and risk of psychiatric, 
47 
autoimmune, inflammatory, diabetic and other non-neoplastic diseases, except for coronary 
48 
heart disease (0.78 [0.67-0.90]), abdominal aortic aneurysm (0.63 [0.49-0.81]), celiac disease 
49 
(0.42 [0.28-0.61]) and interstitial lung disease (0.09 [0.05- 0.15]).  
50 
Conclusions Genetically longer telomeres are associated with increased risk for several 
51 
cancers, but the relative increase in risk is highly heterogeneous across cancer types, and with 
52 
reduced risk for some non-neoplastic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases.

INTRODUCTION 
68 
 
69 
Telomeres are DNA-protein structures at the end of linear chromosomes that protect the 
70 
genome from damage, shorten progressively over time in most somatic tissues1 and are 
71 
proposed markers of biological ageing. Shorter leukocyte telomeres are correlated with older 
72 
age, male sex and other known risk factors for non-communicable diseases2–4 and are 
73 
generally associated with higher risk of cardiovascular diseases5,6, type 2 diabetes7 and non-
74 
vascular non-neoplastic causes of mortality.6 Whether these associations are causal, however, 
75 
is unknown. Telomere length has also been implicated in risk of cancer but the direction and 
76 
magnitude of the association is uncertain and contradictory across observational studies.8–12 
77 
The uncertainty reflects the considerable difficulty of designing observational studies of 
78 
telomere length and cancer incidence that are robust to reverse causation, confounding and 
79 
measurement error. For example, it is possible to detect changes in rates of telomere attrition 
80 
in cancer cases 3-4 years prior to diagnosis12, suggesting that even well designed prospective 
81 
studies may be susceptible to reverse causation. These limitations undermine the potential 
82 
clinical application of telomere length as a tool for risk prediction and disease prevention.  
83 
The aim of the present report was to conduct a Mendelian randomization study to help clarify 
84 
the nature of the association between telomere length and risk of cancer and non-neoplastic 
85 
diseases, using germline genetic variants as instrumental variables for telomere length. The 
86 
approach, which mimics the random allocation of individuals to the placebo and intervention 
87 
arms of a randomized controlled trial, allowed us to: (1) estimate the direction and broad 
88 
magnitude of the association of telomere length with risk of multiple cancer and non-
89 
neoplastic diseases; (2) appraise the evidence for causality in the estimated etiological 
90 
associations; (3) investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in findings for site-specific 
91 
  
5 
cancers; and (4) compare genetic estimates to findings based on directly measured telomere 
92 
length in prospective observational studies.  
93 
 
94 
METHODS 
95 
 
96 
Study design 
97 
The design of our study, illustrated in Figure S1, had three key components: 1) the 
98 
identification of genetic variants to serve as proxies for telomere length; 2) the acquisition of 
99 
summary data for the genetic proxies from genome wide association studies (GWASs) of 
100 
diseases and risk factors; and 3) the classification of diseases and risk factors into primary or 
101 
secondary outcomes based on a priori statistical power. As a first step, we searched the 
102 
GWAS catalog13,14 on the 15 January 2015, to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms 
103 
(SNPs) associated with telomere length. To supplement the list with additional potential 
104 
proxies, we also searched the original study reports curated by the GWAS catalog (using a P 
105 
value threshold of 5x10-8).15–23 We acquired summary data for all SNPs identified by our 
106 
search from a meta-analysis of GWASs of telomere length, involving 9,190 participants of 
107 
European ancestry.16 SNPs initially identified as potential proxies for telomere length were 
108 
subsequently excluded if they lacked strong evidence of association with telomere length. We 
109 
defined strong evidence of association as a p-value <5x10-8 in: i) the discovery stage of at 
110 
least one published GWAS of telomere length15–22 or ii) a meta-analysis of summary data 
111 
from Mangino et al16 and other GWASs of telomere length,15,17–22 with any overlapping 
112 
studies excluded from Mangino et al.16 We also excluded SNPs with a minor allele frequency 
113 
<0.05 or showing strong evidence of between-study heterogeneity in associations with 
114 
telomere length (P≤0.001). 
115 
  
6 
The second key component of our design strategy involved the acquisition of summary data, 
116 
corresponding to the selected genetic proxies for telomere length, from GWASs of non-
117 
communicable diseases and risk factors (Fig. S1). As part of this step, we invited principal 
118 
investigators of non-communicable disease studies curated by the GWAS catalog13,14 to share 
119 
summary data for our study (see Fig. S1 for further details). We also downloaded summary 
120 
data for diseases and risk factors from publically available sources, including study-specific 
121 
websites, dbGAP and the GWAS catalog (Fig. S1).  
122 
The third key component of our design strategy was the classification of diseases and risk 
123 
factors into either primary or secondary outcomes, which we defined on the basis of a priori 
124 
statistical power to detect associations with telomere length. Primary outcomes were defined 
125 
as diseases with sufficient cases and controls for >50% power (i.e. moderate-to-high 
126 
statistical power) and secondary outcomes defined as diseases with <50% power (i.e. low 
127 
statistical power) to detect odds ratios ≥2.0 per standard deviation increase in telomere length 
128 
(alpha assumed to be 0.01). All risk factors were defined as secondary outcomes. Risk factors 
129 
with low statistical power were excluded from all analyses. Further details on the power 
130 
calculations and the study design are provided in the supplementary methods.  
131 
 
132 
Comparison with prospective observational studies 
133 
We searched PubMed for prospective observational studies of the association between 
134 
telomere length and disease (see Tables S3 and S4 for details of the search strategy and 
135 
inclusion criteria). Study-specific relative risks for disease per unit change or quantile 
136 
comparison of telomere length were transformed to a standard deviation scale using 
137 
previously described methods.24 Hazard ratios, risk ratios, and odds ratios were assumed to 
138 
approximate the same measure of relative risk. Where multiple independent studies of the 
139 
same disease were identified, these were combined by fixed effects meta-analysis, unless 
140 
  
7 
there was strong evidence of between-study heterogeneity (PCochran’s Q<0.001), in which case 
141 
they were kept separate.  
142 
 
143 
Statistical analysis 
144 
We combined summary data across SNPs into a single genetic risk score, using maximum 
145 
likelihood to estimate the slope of the relationship between �GD and �GP and a variance-
146 
covariance matrix to make allowance for linkage disequilibrium between SNPs,25 where �GD 
147 
is the change in disease or risk factor per copy of the effect allele and �GP is the standard 
148 
deviation change in telomere length per copy of the effect allele (see supplementary methods 
149 
for technical details). The slope from this approach can be interpreted as the log odds ratio for 
150 
binary outcomes, or the unit change for continuous risk factors, per standard deviation change 
151 
in genetically longer telomeres. P values for heterogeneity in the estimated associations 
152 
between telomere length and disease amongst SNPs were estimated by likelihood ratio 
153 
tests.25 Associations between genetically longer telomeres and continuous risk factors were 
154 
transformed into standard deviation units. For six diseases where only a single SNP was 
155 
available for analysis, we estimated associations using the Wald ratio: �GD/�GP, with standard 
156 
errors approximated by the delta method.26  
157 
Inference of causality in the estimated etiological associations between telomere length and 
158 
disease depends on satisfaction of Mendelian randomization assumptions.27,28 The 
159 
assumptions are: 1) the genetic proxies must be associated with telomere length; 2) the 
160 
genetic proxies should not be associated with confounders; and 3) the genetic proxies must be 
161 
associated with disease exclusively through their effect on telomere length. When these 
162 
assumptions are satisfied, genetic proxies are said to be valid instrumental variables. We 
163 
modeled the impact of violations of these assumptions through two sets of sensitivity 
164 
analyses: a weighted median function29 and MR-Egger regression27 (see supplementary 
165 
  
8 
methods for technical details). We restricted our sensitivity analyses to diseases showing the 
166 
strongest evidence of association with genetically longer telomeres (defined as 
167 
PBonferroni<0.05).  
168 
 
169 
We used meta-regression to appraise potential sources of clinical heterogeneity in our 
170 
findings for cancer outcomes. The association of genetically longer telomeres with the log 
171 
odds of cancer was regressed on cancer incidence, survival time and median age at diagnosis, 
172 
downloaded from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
173 
(SEER) Program,30 and tissue-specific rates of stem cell division from Tomasetti and 
174 
Vogelstein.31 As the downloaded cancer characteristics from SEER correspond to the United 
175 
States population, 77% of which was of white ancestry in 201532, the meta-regression 
176 
analyses excluded genetic studies conducted in East Asian populations. 
177 
 
178 
All analyses were performed in R version 3.1.233 and Stata release 13.1 (StataCorp, College 
179 
Station, TX). P values were two-sided and evidence of association was declared at P<0.05. 
180 
Where indicated, Bonferroni corrections were used to make allowance for multiple testing, 
181 
although this is likely to be overly conservative given the non-independence of many of the 
182 
outcomes tested.

RESULTS  
193 
 
194 
We selected 16 SNPs as genetic proxies for telomere length (Fig. S1 & Table 1). The selected 
195 
SNPs correspond to 10 independent genomic loci that collectively account for 2-3% of the 
196 
variance in leukocyte telomere length, which is equivalent to an F statistic of ~18. This 
197 
indicates that the genetic risk score, constructed from these 10 independent genomic loci, is 
198 
strongly associated with telomere length (see supplementary discussion for a more detailed 
199 
consideration).34 Summary data for the genetic proxies for telomere length were available for 
200 
83 non-communicable diseases and 44 risk factors, corresponding to 409,819 cases (median 
201 
2,092 per disease) and 1,404,633 controls (median 7,738 per disease) (Fig. S1, Table 2 and 
202 
Table S1). The median number of SNPs available across disease datasets was 11 (min=1, 
203 
max=13) and across risk factor datasets was 13 (min=10, max=13). Of the 83 diseases, 55 
204 
were classified as primary outcomes and 28 as secondary outcomes (Table 2, Fig. S1 and 
205 
Table S1).  
206 
The results from primary analyses of non-communicable diseases are presented in Figure 1; 
207 
results from secondary analyses of risk factors and diseases with low a priori power are 
208 
presented in the supplementary materials (Fig. S2, S5 and S6). Genetically longer telomeres 
209 
were associated with higher odds of disease for 9 of 22 primary cancer outcomes, including 
210 
glioma, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, testicular germ cell cancer, melanoma, bladder 
211 
cancer, neuroblastoma, lung adenocarcinoma and serous low malignancy potential ovarian 
212 
cancer (P<0.05) (Fig. 1). The associations were, however, highly variable across cancer 
213 
types, varying from an odds ratio of 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.50 to 1.48) for head and 
214 
  
10 
neck cancer to 5.27 (3.15, 8.81) for glioma. Substantial variability was also observed within 
215 
tissue sites. For example, the odds ratio for lung adenocarcinoma was 3.19 (2.40 to 4.22) 
216 
compared to 1.07 (0.82 to 1.39) for squamous cell lung cancer. For serous low malignancy 
217 
potential ovarian cancer the odds ratio was 4.35 (2.39 to 7.94) compared to odds ratios of 
218 
1.21 (0.87 to 1.68) for endometrioid ovarian cancer, 1.12 (0.938 to 1.34) for serous invasive 
219 
ovarian cancer, 1.04 (0.66 to 1.63) for clear cell ovarian cancer and 1.04 (0.732 to 1.47) for 
220 
mucinous ovarian cancer. The strongest evidence of association was observed for glioma, 
221 
lung adenocarcinoma, neuroblastoma and serous low malignancy potential ovarian cancer 
222 
(PBonferroni<0.05). Results for glioma and bladder cancer showed evidence for replication in 
223 
independent datasets (independent datasets were not available for other cancers) (Fig. S3). 
224 
Genetically longer telomeres were associated with reduced odds of disease for 6 of 32 
225 
primary non-neoplastic diseases, including coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic 
226 
aneurysm, Alzheimer's disease, celiac disease, interstitial lung disease and type 1 diabetes 
227 
(P<0.05) (Figure 1). The strongest evidence of association was observed for coronary heart 
228 
disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, celiac disease and interstitial lung disease 
229 
(PBonferroni<0.05). The associations with coronary heart disease and interstitial lung disease 
230 
showed evidence for replication in independent datasets (Fig. S3).  
231 
 
232 
Our genetic findings were generally similar in direction and magnitude to estimates based on 
233 
observational prospective studies of leukocyte telomere length and disease (Figure 3). Our 
234 
genetic estimates for lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, kidney cancer and glioma, were, 
235 
however, stronger in comparison to observational estimates.  
236 
 
237 
In sensitivity analyses, we appraised the potential impact of confounding by pleiotropic 
238 
pathways on our results. Associations estimated by the weighted median approach were 
239 
  
11 
broadly similar to the main results for glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, serous low malignancy 
240 
potential ovarian cancer, neuroblastoma, abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary heart disease, 
241 
interstitial lung disease and celiac disease (Fig. S4). In the second set of sensitivity analyses, 
242 
implemented by MR-Egger regression, we found little evidence for the presence of pleiotropy 
243 
(P≥0.27) (Fig. S4). The MR-Egger analyses were, however, generally underpowered, as 
244 
reflected by the wide confidence intervals in the estimated odds ratios.  
245 
 
246 
In meta-regression analyses, we observed that genetically longer telomeres tended to be more 
247 
strongly associated with rarer cancers (P=0.02) and cancers at tissue-sites with lower rates of 
248 
stem cell division (P=0.02) (Figure 2). The associations showed little evidence of varying by 
249 
percentage survival five years after diagnosis or median age-at-diagnosis (P=0.4). 
250

DISCUSSION 
252 
 
253 
Summary of main findings 
254 
In this report we show that genetically longer telomeres are associated with increased risk 
255 
of several cancers and with reduced risk of some non-neoplastic diseases, including 
256 
coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, celiac disease and interstitial lung 
257 
disease. The findings for cancer were, however, subject to substantial variation between 
258 
and within tissue sites, which our results suggest could be partly attributable to 
259 
differences in cancer incidence and rates of stem cell division. Given the random 
260 
distribution of genotypes in the general population with respect to lifestyle and other 
261 
environmental factors, as well as the fixed nature of germline genotypes, these results 
262 
should be less susceptible to confounding and reverse causation bias in comparison to 
263 
observational studies. Nevertheless, although compatible with causality, our results could 
264 
reflect violations of Mendelian randomization assumptions, such as confounding by 
265 
pleiotropic pathways, population stratification or ancestry.35 Although we cannot entirely 
266 
rule out this possibility, the majority of our results persisted in sensitivity analyses that 
267 
made allowance for violations of Mendelian randomization assumptions. Confounding by 
268 
population stratification or ancestry is also unlikely, given that the disease GWAS results 
269 
were generally adjusted for both (see supplementary discussion).  
270 
 
271 
Comparison with previous studies 
272 
Our findings for cancer are generally contradictory to those based on retrospective studies, 
273 
which tend to report increased risk for cancer in individuals with shorter telomeres.9,10,36–39 
274 
The contradictory findings may reflect reverse causation bias in the retrospective studies, 
275 
  
13 
whereby shorter telomeres arise as a result of disease, or of confounding effects, e.g. due to 
276 
cases being slightly older than controls even in age-matched analyses. Our findings for cancer 
277 
are generally more consistent with those based on prospective observational studies, which 
278 
tend to report weak or null associations of longer leukocyte telomeres with overall and site-
279 
specific risk of cancer8–11,38,40–59 with some exceptions.60 Our results are also similar to 
280 
previously reported Mendelian randomization studies of telomere length and risk of 
281 
melanoma, lung cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and glioma.61–64 The shape of the 
282 
association with cancer may not, however, be linear over the entire telomere length 
283 
distribution. For example, individuals with dyskeratosis congenita, a disease caused by 
284 
germline loss-of-function mutations in the telomerase component genes TERC and TERT, 
285 
have chronically short telomeres and are at increased risk of some cancers, particularly acute 
286 
myeloid leukemia and squamous cell carcinomas arising at sites of leukoplakia,65,66 
287 
suggesting that the association could be “J” or “U” shaped.41,54 Our results should therefore 
288 
be interpreted as reflecting the average association at the population level and may not be 
289 
generalizable to the extreme ends of the distribution.  
290 
 
291 
Mechanisms of association 
292 
Our cancer findings are compatible with known biology.67 By limiting the proliferative 
293 
potential of cells, telomere shortening may serve as a tumour suppressor; and individuals with 
294 
longer telomeres may be more likely to acquire somatic mutations owing to increased 
295 
proliferative potential.67 Rates of cell division are, however, highly variable amongst tissues31 
296 
and thus the relative gain in cell proliferative potential, conferred by having longer telomeres, 
297 
may also be highly variable across tissues. This could explain the almost 9-fold variation in 
298 
odds ratios observed across cancer types in the present study, as well as the tendency of our 
299 
results to be stronger at tissue sites with lower rates of stem cell division. For example, the 
300 
  
14 
association was strongest for glioma (OR=5.27) and comparatively weak for colorectal 
301 
cancer (OR=1.09) and the rates of stem cell division in the tissues giving rise to these cancers 
302 
differ by several orders of magnitude. In neural stem cells, which give rise to gliomas, the 
303 
number of divisions is ~270 million and for colorectal stem cells is ~1.2 trillion over the 
304 
average lifetime of an individual.31 The observation that genetically longer telomeres were 
305 
more strongly associated with rarer cancers potentially reflects the same mechanism, since 
306 
rarer cancers also tend to show lower rates of stem cell division.31 For example, the incidence 
307 
of glioma is 0.4 and for colorectal cancer is 42.4 per 100,000 per year in the United States.30 
308 
On the other hand, individuals with chronically short telomeres, such as those with 
309 
dyskeratosis congenita, could be more susceptible to genome instability and chromosomal 
310 
end-to-end fusions, which could underlie their increased susceptibility to cancer.65–67  
311 
The inverse associations observed for some non-neoplastic diseases may reflect the impact of 
312 
telomere shortening on tissue degeneration and an evolutionary trade-off for greater 
313 
resistance to cancer at the cost of greater susceptibility to degenerative diseases, particularly 
314 
cardiovascular diseases.68,69  
315 
 
316 
Study limitations 
317 
Our study is subject to some limitations, in addition to the Mendelian randomization 
318 
assumptions already considered above. First, our method assumes that the magnitude of the 
319 
association between SNPs and telomere length is consistent across tissues. Second, our study 
320 
assumed a linear shape of association between telomere length and disease risk, whereas the 
321 
shape could be “J” or “U” shaped.41,54,65 Third, our results assume that the samples used to 
322 
define the genetic proxies for telomere length16 and the various samples used to estimate the 
323 
SNP-disease associations are representative of the same general population, practically 
324 
  
15 
defined as being of similar ethnicity, age and sex distribution.70 This assumption would, for 
325 
example, not apply in the case of the SNP-disease associations derived from East Asian or 
326 
pediatric populations. Generally speaking, violation of the aforementioned assumptions 
327 
would potentially bias the magnitude of the estimated association between genetically longer 
328 
telomeres and disease; but would be unlikely to increase the likelihood of false positives (i.e. 
329 
incorrectly inferring an association when none exists).71 Our results should therefore remain 
330 
informative for the direction and broad magnitude of the average association at the 
331 
population level, even in the presence of such violations. Fourth, we cannot rule out chance in 
332 
explaining some of the weaker findings. Fifth, our results may not be fully representative of 
333 
non-communicable diseases (since not all studies shared data and our analyses were 
334 
underpowered for the secondary disease outcomes). The diseases represented in our primary 
335 
analyses probably account for >60% of all causes of death in American adults.72  
336 
 
337 
Clinical relevance of findings 
338 
Our findings suggest that any potential clinical applications of telomere length, e.g. as a tool 
339 
for risk prediction or as an intervention target for disease prevention, will have to consider a 
340 
trade-off in risk between cancer and non-neoplastic diseases. For example, a number of 
341 
Wellness companies have been established that offer telomere length measurement services 
342 
to the public (via a requesting physician) claiming that shorter telomeres are a general 
343 
indicator of poor health status, older biological age and that information on telomere length 
344 
can be used to motivate healthy lifestyle choices in patients. The conflicting direction of 
345 
association between telomere length and risk of cancer and non-neoplastic diseases suggests, 
346 
however, that such services to the general public may be premature.   
347 
  
16 
Conclusion 
348 
Genetically longer telomeres are associated with increased risk for several cancers, but the 
349 
relative increase in risk is highly heterogeneous across cancer types, and with reduced risk for 
350 
some non-neoplastic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases. Further research is required 
351 
to resolve whether telomere length is a useful predictor of risk that can help guide lifestyle 
352 
modification, to clarify the shape of any dose-response relationship, and to characterise the 
353 
nature of the association in population subgroups.

Figure 2. The association between genetically longer telomeres and odds of cancer as a 
function of selected characteristics  
 
 
 
Legend to Figure 2 
 
The plotted data show how the strength of the relationship between genetically longer telomeres and cancer varies by the selected 
characteristic. The R2 statistic indicates how much of the variation between cancers can be explained by the selected characteristic. P values 
are from meta-regression models. Circle sizes are proportional to the inverse of the variance of the log odds ratio. The hashed line indicates 
the null of no association between telomere length and cancer (i.e. an odds ratio of 1). Data for percentage survival 5 years after diagnosis, 
cancer incidence and median age-at-diagnosis was downloaded from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program.30 Data for 
average lifetime number of stem cell divisions was downloaded from Tomasetti and Vogelstein.31 SD, standard deviation; OR, Odds ratio. 
Not all cancers had information available for the selected characteristics (hence the number of cancers varies across the subplots). 
Information was available for 12 cancers for tissue-specific rates of stem cell division, 18 cancers for percentage surviving 5 years post-
diagnosis, 23 cancers for cancer incidence and 18 cancers for median age-at-diagnosis.
