IMPORTANCE Bullying and being exposed to bullying among children is prevalent, especially
among children with psychiatric symptoms, and constitutes a major concern worldwide.
Whether childhood bullying or exposure to bullying in the absence of childhood psychiatric
symptoms is associated with psychiatric outcomes in adulthood remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE To study the associations between bullying behavior at 8 years of age and adult
psychiatric outcomes by 29 years of age.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Nationwide birth cohort study of 5034 Finnish children
with complete information about childhood bullying behavior was followed up from 8 to 29
years of age. Follow-up was completed on December 31, 2009, and data were analyzed from
January 15, 2013, to February 15, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Information about bullying, exposure to bullying, and
psychiatric symptoms were obtained from parents, teachers, and child self-reports when
children were 8 years of age. Use of specialized services for psychiatric disorders from 16 to
29 years of age was obtained from a nationwide hospital register, including outpatient and
inpatient treatment.
RESULTS Among the 5034 study participants, 4540 (90.2%) did not engage in bullying
behavior; of these, 520 (11.5%) had received a psychiatric diagnosis at follow-up; 33 of 166
(19.9%) who engaged in frequent bullying, 58 of 251 (23.1%) frequently exposed to bullying,
and 24 of 77 (31.2%) who both frequently engaged in and were frequently exposed to
bullying had received psychiatric diagnoses at follow-up. When analyses were adjusted by
sex, family factors, and child psychiatric symptoms at 8 years of age, we found independent
associations of treatment of any psychiatric disorder with frequent exposure to bullying
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.5) and being a bully and exposed to bullying (HR, 2.1;
95% CI, 1.3-3.4). Exposure to bullying was specifically associated with depression (HR, 1.9;
95% CI, 1.2-2.9). Bullying was associated with psychiatric outcomes only in the presence of
psychiatric problems at 8 years of age. Participants who were bullies and exposed to bullying
at 8 years of age had a high risk for several psychiatric disorders requiring treatment in
adulthood. However, the associations with specific psychiatric disorders did not remain
significant after controlling for concurrent psychiatric symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Exposure to bullying, even in the absence of childhood
psychiatric symptoms, is associated with severe adulthood psychiatric outcomes that require
treatment in specialized services. Early intervention among those involved in bullying can
prevent long-term consequences.

B
ullying can be defined as a repetitive aggressive act em-
bodying an imbalance of power in which those ex-
posed cannot defend themselves.1 The involvement in
bullyingisgenerallydistinguishedbetweenthosewhobully(ex-
posing others to bullying), those who are exposed to bullying,
and those who are bullies and exposed to bullying (bullying–
exposed to bullying status). Involvement in bullying may of-
tenbepartofothertypesofexposuretoviolence.2 Frequentin-
volvement in bullying has been shown to have more negative
consequences compared with infrequent involvement.3 Cross-
informant agreement about bullying and exposure to bullying
is found to be low; however, all informant sources have been
foundtobeassociatedwithlong-termadversities.4Boysareusu-
ally involved in more physical bullying, whereas girls are more
involved in relational types.5,6 In addition, boys and girls tend
to respond differently to bullying.7,8
An increasing amount of evidence suggests that bullying
and exposure to bullying contribute to later mental health
problems.3,9-14 However, only a few large-scale longitudinal
prospective studies examine whether the effects of bullying
behavior in childhood extend into adulthood and whether
preexisting behavioral and emotional problems or bullying per
seexplainadultoutcomes.Thefirstlargestudyaboutadultpsy-
chiatric outcomes of childhood bullying8,15 is the Finnish pro-
spective nationwide birth cohort study that used nationwide
registers to assess adversities in adulthood. However, infor-
mation about psychiatric outpatient diagnoses was based on
information from military call-up at ages 18 to 23 years and was
therefore restricted to men.16 Three other large-scale longitu-
dinal prospective studies examined long-term outcomes of ex-
posure to bullying, including the Great Smokey Mountain
Study,17 the British National Child Development Study,18 and
the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children in the
UK,19 but only the first of these17 examined bullies. However,
theGreatSmokeyMountainStudy17reliedonarelativelysmaller
sample, was based on reports from children and parents, and
followedupthechildrento26yearsofage.Inaddition,thepar-
ticipants in the Great Smokey Mountain Study were consider-
ably older at baseline than the participants in the present study
(8 vs 9-16 years). These age differences are important to con-
sider because the frequency and types of bullying behavior
among both sexes change from childhood to adolescence.20-22
The present study is the largest, to our knowledge, to ex-
amine bullying and exposure to bullying among boys and girls
and includes the longest follow-up of their long-term psychi-
atric outcomes. Specifically, in the current nationwide study,
theparticipantswereassessedforbullyingandexposuretobul-
lying at 8 years of age, and the outcome was derived from pro-
spectively acquired contacts to outpatient and inpatient ser-
vices between 16 and 29 years of age. This study is the only
one, to our knowledge, to assess bullying and exposure to bul-
lying based on information from the children at 8 years of age
andtheirparentsandteachers.The3informantsenableaneco-
logical examination of the social and contextual phenomena
ofbullyingbehaviorandareimportanttounderstandtheavail-
able antibullying interventions that target children, schools,
and families. We expected that frequent bullying and expo-
sure to bullying are associated with psychiatric disorders in
adulthood.Inparticular,weexaminedwhetherbullyingand/or

Methods
Participants
The study is part of the multicenter Finnish Nationwide 1981
BirthCohortStudy.23Thestudypopulationincludedall60 007
FinnishchildrenbornfromJanuary1toDecember31,1981,and
alive in 1989. A representative sample of 6017 children was
invited to take part in the study in 1989. This nationwide rep-
resentative sample of 8-year-old children came from all 5 uni-
versity hospital areas in Finland. The sociodemographic char-
acteristicsofthesamplearerepresentativeofthepopulation.23
TheJointCommissiononEthicsofTurkuUniversityandTurku
University Central Hospital approved the study. Written in-
formed consent was obtained from the parents of participants
at enrollment, but the combined information from question-
naires and registry data for the present study was analyzed in
such a way that no participant could be identified.
Data collection in 1989 was organized through teachers
when the participants attended grade 2 in elementary school.
The parents returned the questionnaire in a sealed envelope
to the teacher and consented to participation. The children
filled in a questionnaire in the classroom. After the teacher had
completed teacher questionnaires, all the material was sent to
the researchers.
In Finland, every citizen has a unique personal identifi-
cation number (PIN), consisting of their date of birth and a
4-digit suffix. The study sample from January 1, 1998, to
December 31, 2009, included 5400 participants whose PINs
could be linked with the Population Register and the Finnish
Hospital Discharge Register (FHDR) and who lived in Finland
in 1998. The attrition at follow-up (617 of 6017 [10.3%]) was
owing to random error, such as inappropriately documented
PINs. In addition, children who had died or moved from
Finland from the time of the baseline assessment in 1989 to
the start of the follow-up in 1998 were excluded (n = 16). Com-
pleteinformationaboutbullyingandexposuretobullyingfrom
the 3 informants (children, parents, and teachers) at 8 years
of age and outcome information were obtained from 5034 par-
ticipants. As shown in the eTable in the Supplement, attrition
was not related to bullying status at 8 years of age.
Bullying at 8 Years of Age
Children were asked about bullying by giving them the fol-
lowing 3 alternatives to choose from: (1) “I bully other chil-
dren almost every day”; (2) “I bully sometimes”; and (3) “Usu-
ally I do not bully.” Exposure to bullying was assessed by the
following 3 alternatives: “Other children bully me (1) almost
every day, (2) sometimes, and (3) do not usually bully me.”
Similar questions focusing on bullying and exposure to
bullying were included in the parent and teacher question-
naires, with probe and response items worded as follows: “The
childbulliesotherchildren:(1)doesnotapply,(2)appliessome-
what, and (3) certainly applies.”

Weclassifiedthesampleintothefollowinggroups:(1)those
who never or only sometimes bully and are not exposed to
bullying according to parent and teacher reports and self-
reports; (2) those who frequently bully (but are not exposed
to bullying) according to at least 1 informant; (3) those who are
frequently only exposed to bullying according to at least 1 in-
formant; and (4) those who frequently bully and are exposed
to bullying using pooled information from all 3 informants. For
example, if a child frequently bullied according to teachers and
was frequently exposed to bullying according to self-reports,
he or she was classified in the bullying–exposed to bullying
group. Only participants with complete information about bul-
lying and exposure to bullying from all 3 informants were in-
cluded in the analysis. We combined the parent, teacher, and
child reports of information about bullying and exposure to
bullyingbyusingtheeither-orrule,justifiedbythefindingthat
the interrater agreement was low (weighted κ, 0.11-0.22), and
all 3 informant groups’reports have been shown to be associ-
ated with long-term psychiatric symptoms.4
Psychiatric Symptoms at 8 Years of Age
Three measures of psychiatric symptoms were constructed by
pooling together information from parent and teacher Rutter
BehaviorScales24,25at8yearsofage.ThescoresfromtheRutter
Behavior Scales for parents and teachers were united to gen-
erate pooled Conduct, Hyperactivity, and Emotional sub-
scales. The subscales were standardized separately as de-
scribed in a prior report for boys and girls.26 The Conduct,
Hyperactivity, and Emotional subscales were given equal
weight from each informant, and questions about bullying and
exposure to bullying were excluded. If information from only
theparentortheteacherbutnotbothwasavailable,thepooled
scale was not generated for the participant concerned.
Finally, the results of the 3 subscales were categorized as less
than or greater than the 90th percentile because these psy-
chiatric measures have been found to be associated with sub-
sequent adverse outcomes.26-31 The cutoff points were sex
specific and based on the distribution of scores in the present
sample. The child was considered to have a positive screen for
psychiatricproblemsifheorshescoredatgreaterthanthe90th
percentile in 1 or more of the 3 subscales.
Co-occurring Bullying Behavior and Psychiatric Symptoms
To examine whether bullying or exposure to bullying at 8 years
ofage,withorwithoutco-occurringpsychiatricsymptoms,was
relatedtoadultoutcomes,westratifiedthewholesamplebased
on information about bullying and/or exposure to bullying and
psychiatric symptoms. Pooling information about psychiat-
ric problems (negative or positive findings based on the 3 psy-
chiatric measures) and bullying status (no frequent bullying
or exposure to bullying, frequent bullying, frequent expo-
sure to bullying, or bullying–exposure to bullying), we strati-
fied the whole sample into 8 groups by screen finding and
bullying status.
Family Variables
Family background variables at 8 years of age shown to be
associated with bullying behavior and later psychiatric
outcomes26,27,29-32 included information about parental edu-
cational level based on the father’
s or the mother’
s comple-
tion of at least 12 years of education. The family structure was
based on whether the child lived in a family with 2 biological
parents or whether the family had some other constellation.
Use of Specialized Services for Psychiatric Disorders
The PIN codes of the participants were linked to data from the
FHDRfromJanuary1,1998,throughDecember31,2009,when
the participants were 16 to 29 years of age. The follow-up
started in 1998 because, since 1998, the FHDR has included
informationfromallvisitsinpublicoutpatientclinicsinFinland
in addition to inpatient data. Health care is free in Finland, and
most patients in need of specialist treatment are referred to
public outpatient clinics, whereas the private sector is primar-
ily complementary to the public sector. The FHDR is main-
tained by the Institute of Health and Welfare and extensively
documented in psychiatric research.8,33,34 The FHDR in-
cludes the PIN of the patient, the date of the visit or admis-
sion, and the diagnosis according to the International Statis-
tical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). In this
study, only main diagnoses were taken into account. All out-
patient visits or registered inpatient admissions, that is, all ser-
vices in psychiatric and general hospitals, were included. The
following diagnostic groups were studied: any psychiatric
diagnosis (ICD-10 codes F00-F99); schizophrenia and other
psychotic disorders (ICD-10 codes F20-F29); depressive dis-
orders (ICD-10 codes F32-F39); anxiety, stress-related, adjust-
ment, and somatoform disorders (ICD-10 codes F40-F48;
abbreviated anxiety); eating disorders (ICD-10 code F50); and
substance use disorders (ICD-10 codes F10-F19).
Statistical Analysis
DatawereanalyzedfromJanuary15,2013,toFebruary15,2015.
To take into account the possibility of emigration and death
during the follow-up, we used Cox proportional hazards re-
gression models, which are a class of survival models. The age
of the participants in days defined the survival time. The event
was defined as the first visit or admission to specialized ser-
vices with the studied diagnosis. The time to moving from the
country (n = 5), death (n = 11), or the end of the follow-up on
December 31, 2009, was treated as the censored time obser-
vation. The associations between the predictors and the out-
comes were quantified with hazards ratios and their 95% CIs
from the Cox proportional hazard regression models. P val-
ueswerecalculatedusingtheWaldχ2test.Inunadjustedanaly-
ses, each predictor was analyzed separately in a model. In ad-
justedanalyses,alldefinedpredictorswereenteredatonceinto

also shows the results when all analyses were additionally con-
trolled with psychiatric symptoms at 8 years of age. Bullying–
exposure to bullying and frequent exposure to bullying re-
mained significantly associated with any psychiatric disorder
outcome. Furthermore, frequent exposure to bullying was in-
dependently associated with depression.
Table 3 presents the results when the sample was strati-
fied to groups based on bullying–exposure to bullying status
and psychiatric symptoms in at least 1 domain (ie, Conduct,
Hyperactivity, or Emotional subscales) at 8 years of age. The
outcomes in this analysis were the presence of any psychiat-
ric disorder and depression from 16 to 29 years of age. The ref-
erence group consisted of those without frequent bullying in-
volvement or exposure to bullying and negative findings on
all 3 psychiatric subscales. Frequent exposure to bullying with
and without co-occurring psychiatric symptoms was associ-
atedwithlaterpsychiatricdisorders.Frequentbullyingandbul-
lying–exposure to bullying predicted psychiatric outcome only
when co-occurring with psychiatric symptoms.
Discussion
The findings of the study are important for mental health re-
search,prevention,assessment,andintervention.Frequentex-
posure to bullying at 8 years of age was associated with later
adult psychiatric disorders, even in the absence of childhood
psychiatric symptoms. This association indicates that fre-
quent exposure to bullying in childhood is a significant stand-
alone indicator for later psychiatric disorders requiring treat-
mentinspecializedservices.Bullyingwasassociatedwithlater
psychiatric disorders only when occurring with psychiatric
symptoms at 8 years of age. In particular, bullying–exposure
to bullying status was associated with a wide range of adult
psychiatric outcomes, including schizophrenia and nonaffec-
tive psychoses, depression, and substance use disorders. Most
participants with bullying–exposure to bullying status were
maleandhadcomorbidpsychiatricsymptomsat8yearsofage,
which explains the findings. This result is in accordance with
those of previous longitudinal studies showing that individu-
alswithbullying–exposuretobullyingbehavioroftenhavepoor
outcomes.16,17,35Bullying–exposuretobullyingbehaviorserves
as an important red flag that intensive preventive or amelio-
rative interventions are warranted.
Ourfindingsprovidestrongevidencebyitsprospectivena-
ture;alongperiodofdatacollection;alargesamplesize;pooled

based on a nationwide register; controlling for parents’edu-
cational level, family structure, and childhood psychiatric
symptoms; and the stratification of the sample based on in-
formation about bullying–exposure to bullying and psychiat-
ric disorders. Our results are in line with those of previous lon-
gitudinal findings that the effects of exposure to bullying
remained significant after controlling for known correlates of
exposure to bullying,15,18,19 whereas bullying others was not
associated with adverse outcomes in adulthood when other
baseline variables were controlled for.3,36 In the Great Smokey
Mountain Study—the only previous longitudinal study from
childhood or adolescence to adulthood17 that included base-
line information about bullying and exposure to bullying—
bullying–exposure to bullying at 9 to 16 years of age was
associated with psychiatric outcomes at 26 years of age, and
the effects were maintained even after accounting for preex-
isting psychiatric problems or family hardships.
To our knowledge, the present study provides the stron-

The findings remained significant after controlling for psychi-
atric symptoms, indicating that exposure to bullying puts chil-
dren at high risk for later depression, requiring treatment in
specialized services regardless of the comorbid psychiatric
symptoms at 8 years of age. Accordingly, previous studies have
found that exposure to bullying by peers in adolescence is

associated with an increase in the risk for depression,2,18,37 and
childhood exposure to bullying is associated with later use of
antidepressants.8 The association between exposure to bul-
lying and depression is in line with the interpersonal theory
of depression, indicating that negative interpersonal events in
childhood may lead to the development of later clinical
depression.38,39 In this sense, exposure to bullying by peers in
childhood is similar to other types of trauma, humiliation,
and/or neglect, which lead to similar consequences.40 An-
other possible option is the existence of a common factor (eg,
genetic, personality) for being exposed to bullying and de-
pressed. Media reports often link childhood exposure to bul-
lying with suicide.41 The possible link between early child-
hoodexposuretobullyingbypeersandlaterclinicaldepression
and possible suicidal tendency has high public health impor-
tance and deserves future research.
The primary limitation in the present study is the lack of
understanding on how bullying–exposure to bullying leads to
psychiatric disorders. Future studies containing more nu-
anced information about the mediating factors that occur be-
tween childhood bullying and adulthood disorders will be
needed to shed light on this important question. Of note, in the
present study bullying, bullying exposure, and bullying-
exposure to bullying were assessed, but no information about
bystanderbehaviorwasobtained.Inaddition,otherfactorsthat
were not assessed include parenting style, family function-
ing, and biological, genetic, and other environmental factors.
Bullying was assessed only at 8 years of age, which prevented
us from assessing the chronicity of the bullying behavior. Bul-
lying questions did not include the definition of or informa-
tion about the type of bullying. However, providing a defini-
tion of bullying in assessments does not yield a more rigorous
measure.42 An additional limitation is that childhood psychi-
atric symptoms were based on screening instruments, and no
diagnostic assessment was available. Finally, the outcome was
based on service use, and the use of registers allowed us to cap-
ture only those participants who enter treatment. In Finland,
health care services are primarily public; for example, almost
all adults with a psychotic disorder can be found in the
registers.33 However, participants with less severe disorders
may not enter treatment and therefore are not included in
the registers.
Conclusions
Bullying should be conceptualized within the framework of
mental health. From a research perspective, prospective lon-
gitudinal studies should examine the various mechanisms and
pathways that play a role in the severe mental health out-
comes of the children involved in bullying. With regard to pre-
vention and treatment, school authorities should consider in-
tegrating preventive efforts for bullying and psychiatric
problems. Parents, teachers, and pediatricians need to be edu-
cated about the association between bullying involvement and
psychiatric outcomes so as to screen and intervene if needed.
In some cases, exposure to bullying, even in the absence of
childhood psychiatric symptoms, is associated with severe
adulthoodpsychiatricoutcomes.Exposuretobullyingisaform
of abuse that should be addressed effectively even when other
problems do not exist. Policy makers and health care profes-
sionals should be aware of the complex nature between bul-
lying and psychiatric outcomes when they implement preven-
tion and treatment interventions.
