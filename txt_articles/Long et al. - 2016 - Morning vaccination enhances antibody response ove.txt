Objectives:
 Older  adults  are
 less  able  to  produce  a protective
 antibody
 response
 to vaccinations.
 One factor
that
 contributes
 to  this
 is  immune
 ageing.  Here
 we  examined
 whether
 diurnal
 variations
 in
 immune
responses
 might
 extend
 to the  antibody
 response
 to  vaccination.
Design:
 We  utilised  a  cluster-randomised
 trial  design.
Setting:
 24  General
 Practices
 (GPs)
 across  the  West
 Midlands,  UK  who  were  assigned
 to
 morning
 (9–11  am;
15
 surgeries)
 or  afternoon
 (3–5  pm;  9 surgeries)
 vaccination
 times
 for  the  annual
 UK
 influenza
 vaccination
programme.
Participants:
 276  adults
 (aged  65+
 years
 and  without
 a current
 infection
 or  immune
 disorder
 or  taking
immunosuppressant
 medication).
Interventions:
 Participants
 were  vaccinated
 in  the  morning
 or  afternoon
 between
 2011
 and  2013.
Main
 outcome  measures:
 The  primary
 outcome
 was  the  change
 in  antibody
 titres to the  three
 vaccine
influenza
 strains  from  pre-vaccination
 to one
 month  post-vaccination.
 Secondary
 outcomes
 of serum
cytokines
 and  steroid
 hormone
 concentrations
 were
 analysed
 at baseline
 to  identify  relationships  with
antibody
 responses.
Results:
 The  increase
 in  antibody
 levels  due  to vaccination
 differed  between
 morning
 and  afternoon
administration;
 mean  difference
 (95%  CI)  for H1N1  A-strain,
 293.3  (30.97–555.66)
 p  =
 .03,  B-strain,
 15.89
(3.42–28.36)
 p  =  .01, but  not  H3N2  A-strain,  47.0  (−52.43  to 146.46)
 p
 =  .35;  those
 vaccinated
 in the
morning
 had a greater  antibody  response.
 Cytokines
 and  steroid
 hormones
 were  not  related
 to  antibody
responses.
 No  adverse
 events  were  reported.
Conclusions:
 This  simple  manipulation
 in  the  timing
 of vaccine
 administration
 to
 favour  morning
 vacci-
nation
 may
 be beneficial
 for the influenza
 antibody
 response
 in  older
 adults,  with  potential
 implications
for
 vaccination
 strategies
 generally.

 Introduction
The
 influenza
 vaccination
 is
 part
 of
 the
 seasonal
 vaccination
programme
 carried
 out
 by
 General
 Practice
 (GP)
 surgeries
 across
the
 UK
 and
 in
 many
 other
 countries,
 with
 patients
 aged
 65+
 years
being
 the
 majority
 of
 recipients.
 Despite
 this,
 the
 influenza
 virus
 is
responsible
 for
 250,000–500,000
 thousand
 deaths
 annually

older
 adults
 are
 the
 highest
 proportion
 of
 the
 hospitalisations
 and
influenza-related
 mortalities
 [2].
 Although
 the
 contributing
 factors
are
 varied,
 the
 age-related
 decline
 in
 immunity
 reduces
 the
 ability
of
 older
 adults
 to
 produce
 adequate
 antibody
 responses
 following
vaccination
 [3,4],
 compromising
 the
 protection
 given
 against
 the
influenza
 virus.
A
 number
 of
 interventions
 have
 sought
 to
 improve
 the
 antibody
response
 to
 vaccination.
 For
 example,
 the
 addition
 of
 adjuvants
 to
the
 vaccine
 preparation,
 but
 these
 can
 have
 adverse
 side
 effects
[5].
 More
 recently,
 behavioural
 interventions
 prior
 to
 vaccination
have
 been
 used,
 such
 as
 aerobic
 exercise
 [6–8],
 with
 some
 success.
However,
 such
 interventions
 may
 be
 impractical
 in
 a
 public
 health
setting.

 2679–2685
Recent
 developments
 in
 chronobiology
 have
 revealed
 that
 the
response
 of
 the
 immune
 system
 to
 challenge
 varies
 significantly
with
 the
 time
 of
 day
 [9,10]
 and
 56
 of
 the
 top
 100
 best-selling
 drugs
in
 the
 United
 States
 target
 the
 product
 of
 a
 circadian
 gene
 [11]
suggesting
 that
 the
 timing
 of
 vaccinations
 may
 also
 influence
 anti-
body
 responses.
 Indeed,
 circadian
 variations
 in
 responses
 to
 antigen
have
 been
 observed
 in
 mice
 [12,13].
 The
 scant
 previous
 research
in
 humans
 has
 produced
 mixed
 results.
 An
 attenuated
 Venezualan
equine
 encephalomyelitis
 vaccine
 administered
 at
 8
 am
 resulted
 in
peak
 antibody
 titres
 4
 days
 earlier
 than
 the
 peak
 in
 those
 vacci-
nated
 at
 8
 pm
 [14].
 However,
 a
 hepatitis
 B
 vaccine
 administered
in
 the
 afternoon
 between
 1
 and
 3
 pm
 yielded
 a
 higher
 antibody
response,
 compared
 to
 vaccination
 between
 7.30
 and
 9
 am
 [15].
More
 recently,
 a
 convenience
 sample
 of
 164
 men
 and
 women
showed
 that
 men
 exhibited
 a
 higher
 antibody
 response
 when
 vacci-
nated
 in
 the
 morning
 [16].
 However,
 this
 study
 was
 not
 randomised
and
 used
 a
 relatively
 small
 mixed
 sample
 of
 young
 and
 elderly
populations
 and
 hepatitis
 A
 and
 influenza
 vaccinations,
 respec-
tively.
 It
 is
 possible
 that
 diurnal
 variations
 in
 immune
 cell
 responses
and/or
 levels
 of
 hormones
 with
 immune
 modifying
 properties,
 such
as
 cortisol
 or
 inflammatory
 cytokines,
 provide
 an
 advantageous
period
 for
 vaccination
 responses
 to
 occur.
 Therefore,
 adjusting
 the
timing
 of
 vaccination
 may
 be
 a
 simple,
 cost
 neutral
 and
 effective
public
 health
 intervention
 to
 improve
 vaccination
 responses,
 par-
ticularly
 in
 older
 adults.
 However,
 it
 is
 possible
 that
 the
 best
 time
 of
day
 for
 vaccination
 may
 be
 different
 for
 different
 vaccines,
 as
 they
stimulate
 different
 types
 of
 immune
 response
 for
 protection,
 e.g.
thymus-dependent
 versus
 thymus-independent
 responses.
1.1.
 Rationale
 for
 cluster
 design
 and
 hypothesis
The
 present
 cluster-randomised
 trial
 aimed
 to
 determine
whether
 randomising
 GP
 surgeries
 to
 administering
 the
 influenza
vaccination
 to
 older
 adults
 in
 the
 morning
 (9–11
 am)
 or
 afternoon
(3–5
 pm)
 impacted
 upon
 the
 magnitude
 of
 antibody
 responses
 at
four
 weeks
 post
 vaccination.
 Timings
 were
 chosen
 to
 represent
the
 two
 extremes
 of
 routine
 morning
 versus
 afternoon
 clinics,
 in
keeping
 with
 GP
 surgery
 opening
 hours
 for
 practicality
 of
 future
application.
 A
 cluster
 design
 was
 chosen
 to
 fit
 the
 practicalities
of
 organising
 GP
 surgery
 vaccination
 clinics.
 It
 was
 hypothesised
that
 morning
 vaccination
 would
 be
 more
 beneficial
 for
 antibody
responses
 than
 afternoon
 vaccination,
 at
 both
 individual
 and
 clus-
ter
 level.

 Methods
2.1.
 Participants
 and
 eligibility
 criteria
298
 participants
 were
 recruited
 from
 24
 Primary
 Care
 General
Practices
 within
 the
 West
 Midlands,
 UK,
 with
 276
 being
 eligible
 for
full
 data
 analysis.
 Eligibility
 criteria
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 study
 were:
≥65
 years
 old,
 taking
 no
 medication
 which
 could
 influence
 immune
function
 e.g.
 immune-suppressants,
 no
 current
 acute
 infections
and
 no
 current
 cancer,
 diabetes,
 chronic
 inflammatory
 disease
 or
immune
 disorder.
 There
 were
 no
 eligibility
 criteria
 for
 clusters
except
 being
 an
 NHS
 GP
 surgery
 within
 the
 West
 Midlands
 UK
 area
willing
 to
 take
 part
 in
 the
 trial
 and
 be
 randomised
 to
 vaccinating
participants
 in
 one
 of
 the
 two
 time
 slots.
2.2.
 Trial
 design
This
 was
 a
 non-blinded
 cluster-randomised
 trial.
 This
 study
was
 approved
 by
 the
 South
 Birmingham
 Local
 Research
 Ethics
committee
 and
 funded
 by
 an
 MRC
 Lifelong
 Health
 and
 Well-
being
 Collaborative
 Research
 Grant.
 This
 trial
 is
 registered
 with
the
 ISRCTN
 as
 a
 controlled
 trial
 (ISRCTN70898162).

 registry.2
2.3.
 Intervention
Participants
 were
 invited
 to
 take
 part
 in
 the
 study
 by
 a
 let-
ter
 sent
 from
 their
 GP
 surgery
 on
 behalf
 of
 the
 research
 sponsor
(University
 of
 Birmingham
 (UB))
 and
 they
 returned
 the
 signed
written
 informed
 consent
 form
 to
 the
 research
 team
 at
 UB.
 GP
surgeries
 (clusters)
 where
 participants
 had
 returned
 consent
 forms
were
 then
 notified
 of
 which
 arm
 of
 the
 trial
 (morning
 or
 after-
noon)
 they
 had
 been
 randomised
 to.
 Participants
 were
 then
 invited
to
 attend
 on
 two
 separate
 occasions,
 one
 month
 apart.
 The
 ini-
tial
 session
 involved
 providing
 a
 blood
 sample
 and
 receiving
 the
trivalent
 influenza
 vaccination
 as
 standard
 practice
 (administered
intra-muscularly)
 between
 either
 9
 and
 11
 am
 or
 3
 and
 5
 pm.
 In
accordance
 with
 standard
 GP
 practise,
 the
 standard
 influenza
 vac-
cine
 used
 routinely
 during
 each
 influenza
 season
 was
 administered
using
 the
 standard
 single
 dose
 (0.5
 ml),
 route
 of
 administration
(intramuscularly
 into
 deltoid)
 and

 A
 questionnaire
 pack
 was
 given
 to
participants
 to
 complete
 at
 home
 and
 return
 by
 mail.
 One
 month
later,
 participants
 returned
 to
 their
 GP
 practice
 to
 give
 a
 morning
fasted
 blood
 sample
 and
 have
 weight,
 height
 and
 waist
 to
 hip
 ratio
measurements
 taken.
 Number
 of
 previous
 influenza
 vaccinations
the
 participant
 had
 received
 was
 gained
 from
 GP
 electronic
 records.
2.4.
 Questionnaires
Participants
 completed
 a
 battery
 of
 questionnaires
 at
 base-
line
 to
 assess
 socio-demographics
 and
 health
 behaviours.
 Health
behaviours
 (smoking,
 alcohol
 consumption
 and
 sleep
 duration)
were
 assessed
 using
 a
 questionnaire
 adapted
 from
 the
 Whitehall
 II
study
 [17];
 smoking
 and
 drinking
 alcohol
 were
 dichotomised
 into
yes/no
 variables.
2.5.
 Blood
 sampling
 and
 analysis
Blood
 was
 collected
 in
 to
 anti-coagulant
 free
 tubes
 (BD
 Vacu-
tainer,
 UK)
 and
 clotted
 at
 room
 temperature
 before
 centrifugation
at
 2000
 ×
 g
 for
 5
 min.
 The
 separated
 serum
 was
 frozen
 at
 −20 ◦C
 for
later
 analysis.
2.5.1.
 Haemagglutination
 inhibition
 assay
Anti-influenza
 antibody
 titres
 were
 measured
 using
 an
 in-
house
 haemagglutination
 inhibition
 test
 as
 described
 in
 the
2 Following
 completion
 of
 the
 trial
 in
 2013,
 the
 sponsor
 (University
 of
 Birming-
ham)
 through
 a
 query
 to
 the
 MHRA,
 reclassified
 this
 trial
 as
 a
 Clinical
 Trial
 of
 an
Investigational
 Medicinal
 Product
 (CTIMP).
 The
 study
 was
 retrospectively
 submit-
ted
 to
 an
 ethics
 committee
 appropriate
 for
 a
 CTIMP,
 Haydock
 NRES
 Committee
 North
West,
 and
 received
 a
 favourable
 opinion
 through
 special
 ethics
 review.
 Following
consideration
 by
 the
 sponsor
 and
 MHRA,
 it
 was
 deemed
 not
 justifiable
 to
 prevent
the
 use
 of
 the
 trial
 data
 given
 that
 patients
 were
 to
 receive
 this
 medication
 regard-
less
 of
 whether
 this
 was
 done
 as
 part
 of
 the
 trial
 or
 as
 per
 routine
 practice.
 There
were
 no
 adverse
 events
 reported,
 and
 the
 data
 and
 analyses
 were
 deemed
 reliable
and
 appropriate
 by
 the

 Details
 of
 this
 assay
 method
 have
been
 described
 elsewhere
 [19].
2.5.2.
 Cytokine
 assay
Multiplex
 technology
 was
 used
 to
 assay
 serum
 cytokines
 IL-6
and
 IL-10
 in
 duplicate
 according
 to
 the
 manufacturer’s
 specifi-
cations
 (BioRad
 Laboratories,
 UK).
 Acquisition
 software
 (BioPlex
Software
 Manager
 version
 4,
 BioRad
 Laboratories,
 CA,
 USA)
 was
used
 to
 generate
 cytokine
 concentrations
 from
 a
 five
 parameter
logistic
 curve
 fit.
2.5.3.
 Steroid
 analysis
Liquid
 chromatography
 tandem
 mass
 spectrometry
 was
 used
for
 the
 analysis
 of
 seven
 steroids
 in
 serum
 (cortisol,
 cortisone,
corticosterone,
 11-deoxycortisol,
 testosterone,
 dehydroepiandros-
terone
 (DHEA)
 and
 androstenedione).
 All
 steroids
 were
 extracted
via
 liquid/liquid
 extraction,
 analysed,
 derivatised
 and
 re-analysed
as
 previously
 described
 [20].
 Quantification
 was
 achieved
 through
reference
 to
 a
 calibration
 series
 which
 spans
 the
 expected
 concen-
tration
 range
 of
 the
 analyte
 0.25–500
 ng/mL.
2.6.
 Outcomes
The
 primary
 outcome
 for
 this
 trial
 was
 the
 change
 in
 antibody
titre
 from
 baseline
 pre-vaccination
 to
 one
 month
 post-vaccination
at
 the
 individual
 level.
 Secondary
 outcome
 measures
 were
 cytokine
and
 steroid
 hormone
 levels,
 as
 potential
 underlying
 mecha-
nisms
 of
 any
 effect
 of
 time
 of
 day
 and/or
 gender
 on
 vaccination
response.
2.7.
 Sample
 size
The
 initial
 sample
 size
 was
 determined
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 our
 pre-
vious
 study
 which
 found
 a
 mean
 difference
 in
 log10
 antibody
 titre
between
 morning
 and
 afternoon
 vaccination
 of
 0.27
 for
 men.
 How-
ever,
 this
 previous
 research
 was
 an
 opportunistic
 study
 and
 there
is
 good
 evidence
 that
 the
 effect
 sizes
 in
 non-randomised
 studies
are
 much
 larger
 than
 those
 typically
 found
 in
 randomised
 stud-
ies.
 Consequently,
 with
 a
 mean
 difference
 of
 0.17,
 power
 at
 0.90,
alpha
 at
 0.05,
 within
 and
 between
 cluster
 variance
 of
 0.0985
 and
0.0036,
 respectively,
 the
 number
 of
 men
 required
 in
 two
 groups
of
 8
 surgeries
 would
 be
 13
 per
 surgery.
 This
 would
 give
 104
 men
in
 each
 arm
 of
 the
 trial,
 208
 men
 in
 all
 from
 16
 surgeries.
 Like-
wise
 a
 separate
 comparison
 of
 females
 in
 the
 two
 arms
 would
require
 104
 females
 in
 each
 arm
 making
 a
 total
 of
 416
 patients
in
 all.
2.8.
 Randomisation
 and
 blinding
General
 Practices
 who
 agreed
 to
 take
 part
 in
 the
 trial
 were
cluster-randomised
 by
 the
 research
 team
 annually
 each
 influenza
season
 through
 random
 selection
 of
 morning

 As

was
 annual
 it
 was
 possible
 for
 the
 same

 practice
 to
 be
 ran-
domised
 to
 different

 in
 different

 of
 the

 Due
 to
 the
nature
 of
 randomising
 to
 different

 blinding
 was
 not
possible.

 Statistical
 analysis
Analyses
 were
 carried
 out
 using
 IBM
 SPSS
 version
 21.0
 (IBM
SPSS
 Inc,
 Chicago,
 IL)
 by
 the
 lead
 author
 (AP).
 Differences
 between
the
 intervention
 arms
 (morning
 versus
 afternoon)
 in
 baseline
 par-
ticipant
 socio-demographic
 characteristics
 were
 analysed
 using
one
 way
 analysis
 of
 variance
 (ANOVA)
 for
 continuous
 data
 or
 chi-
squared
 test,
 as
 appropriate.
 As
 antibody
 titres
 were
 measured
 over
three
 years,
 similar
 antibody
 strains
 within
 the
 influenza
 vacci-
nation
 were
 combined
 over
 the
 three
 years
 in
 order
 to
 examine
responses
 to
 H1N1,
 H3N2,
 and
 the
 B
 strains
 overall
 in
 each
 vaccine;
these
 yielded
 three
 new
 variables,
 H1N1
 combined
 (all
 A/California
strains),
 H3N2
 combined
 (2011
 A/Perth,
 2012
 A/Victoria
 and
 2013
A/Texas)
 and
 B
 combined
 (2011
 B/Brisbane,
 2012
 B/Wisconsin
 and
2013
 B/Massachusetts).
 This
 method
 of
 combining
 influenza
 strains
has
 been
 used
 previously
 [21].
 Mixed
 modelling
 was
 used
 to
 exam-
ine
 the
 effect
 of
 the
 intervention
 with
 one-month
 antibody
 titre
as
 the
 dependent
 variable,
 baseline
 antibody
 titre
 as
 a
 covari-
ate,
 and,
 due
 to
 cluster-randomisation,
 GP
 surgery
 as
 a
 random
effect.
Given
 our
 previous
 findings
 with
 regard
 to
 time
 of
 day
 x
 sex
interaction
 effects
 [16],
 separate
 exploratory
 covariate
 analyses
were
 run,
 entering
 time
 of
 day
 ×
 sex
 as
 an
 interaction
 term.
 To
determine
 whether
 any
 intervention
 effects
 were
 mediated
 by
cytokines
 or
 steroid
 hormone
 levels
 further
 separate
 exploratory
models
 were
 run
 with
 each
 cytokine
 or
 hormone
 as
 an
 additional
covariate.
Missing
 data
 for
 antibody
 titre
 led
 to
 the
 exclusion
 of
 partic-
ipants,
 but
 missing
 data
 for
 exploratory
 covariates
 were
 minimal,
thus
 analyses
 were
 run
 on
 the
 available
 data
 excluding
 participants
without
 complete
 data;
 variations
 in
 degrees
 of
 freedom
 reflect
this.

 Sensitivity
 analysis
As

 by
 the

 we
 repeated
 the
 above
 analysis
 adjusting
 for

 type
as
 a
 covariate.

 did
 not

 the

 (p

 and
systemic

Table

 as
 expected,
 there
 were
 significant

 To
 examine
 whether
 any

 Discussion
This
 study
 examined
 whether
 manipulating
 the
 time
 of
 day
 an
older
 adult
 received
 their
 annual
 influenza
 vaccination
 would
 have
an
 effect
 on
 the
 magnitude
 of
 the
 antibody
 response
 at
 one
 month.
Results
 showed
 that
 antibody
 responses
 to
 two
 of
 three
 influenza
strains
 were
 higher
 when
 the
 vaccination
 was
 given
 in
 the
 morn-
ing.
 Whether
 these
 differences
 relate
 to
 clinical
 disease
 resistance
remains
 to
 be
 examined.
 Further,
 although
 several
 steroid
 hor-
mones
 and
 cytokines
 differed
 between
 the
 trial
 arms,
 as
 expected
given
 their
 known
 diurnal
 rhythms,
 covariate
 adjustment
 did
 not
reveal
 any
 mediation
 of
 the
 time
 of
 day
 effect
 by
 these
 factors.
These
 findings
 show
 some
 similarities
 to
 our
 previous
 pilot
study
 [16],
 where
 men
 vaccinated
 in
 the
 morning
 had
 a
 greater
antibody
 response
 to
 hepatitis
 A
 and
 the
 A/Panama
 influenza
 strain.
However,
 the
 present
 study
 has
 greater
 power
 (276
 versus
 164
 par-
ticipants),
 was
 a
 cluster
 randomised
 trial
 and
 used
 only
 older
 adults,
rather
 than
 a
 mix
 of
 young
 and
 old
 subjects.
 Further,
 there
 were
 no
interactions
 between
 time
 of
 vaccination
 and
 sex
 in
 the
 present
study
 such
 that
 both
 men
 and
 women
 showed
 greater
 responses
in
 the
 morning.
 It
 is
 not
 clear
 why
 we
 did
 not
 find
 a
 sex
 difference
in
 the
 present
 analysis,
 but
 it
 fits
 with
 the
 lack
 of
 evidence
 of
 sex
differences
 in
 diurnal
 rhythms
 [22,23].
With
 regard
 to
 steroid
 hormones
 as
 a
 potential
 mechanism
of
 effect,
 higher
 levels
 of
 cortisol,
 cortisol:cortisone
 and
 corti-
costerone,
 and
 lower
 levels
 of
 DHEA
 and
 androstenedione,
 were
observed
 among
 those
 vaccinated
 in
 the
 morning.
 This
 is
 expected
due
 to
 the
 diurnal
 rhythm
 of
 cortisol,
 with
 levels
 peaking
 30
 min
post
 awakening
 then
 decreasing
 throughout
 the
 day
 [24].
 Although
higher
 levels
 of
 cortisol
 are
 generally
 associated
 with
 immune
 sup-
pression,
 cortisol
 is
 immunoregulatory
 and
 can
 boost
 immunity
[25],
 and
 higher
 levels
 have
 previously
 been
 associated
 with
 greater
antibody
 responses,
 in
 the
 context
 of
 acute
 psychological
 stress
[26,27].
 However,
 neither
 cortisol
 nor
 the
 other
 hormones
 mea-
sured
 mediated
 the
 effects
 observed
 here.
4.1.
 Strengths
 and
 limitations
The
 present
 study
 was
 the
 first
 large
 scale
 randomised
 trial
 of
different
 times
 of
 vaccination
 and
 provides
 evidence
 that
 morn-
ing
 vaccination
 enhances
 the
 antibody
 response
 to
 the
 influenza
vaccine.
 However,
 the
 trial
 has
 some
 limitations.
 First,
 we
 were
not
 able
 to
 reach
 our
 target
 recruitment
 of
 400
 participants
 over
three
 years,
 and
 additional
 power
 might
 have
 made
 our
 indicative
results
 stronger.
 Second,
 due
 to
 the
 smaller
 numbers
 and
 differ-
ent
 influenza
 strains
 in
 the
 vaccine
 across
 the
 three
 years
 of
 the
study,
 we  were
 forced
 to
 combine
 responses
 across
 similar
 strains
for
 analysis.
 However,
 this
 method
 has
 been
 used
 previously
 in
similar
 research
 [21]
 and
 provides
 additional
 confidence
 that
 our
findings
 are
 generalisable
 beyond
 one
 year
 of
 influenza
 vaccine
strains.
 Third,
 as
 the
 present
 study
 aimed
 to
 fit
 in
 with
 usual
 practice
at
 each
 GP
 surgery,
 it
 did
 not
 constrain
 each
 surgery
 to
 the
 choice
 of
influenza
 vaccine
 used,
 thus
 each
 used
 their
 usual
 vaccine
 manufac-
turer,
 which
 differed
 between
 surgeries.
 However,
 although
 these
varied,
 they
 contained
 the
 same
 influenza
 strains
 each
 year
 and
work
 in
 the
 same
 manner
 with
 the
 same
 dose.
 Further,
 adjustment
for
 the
 exact
 preparation
 used
 did
 not
 alter
 our
 main
 findings.
Our
 future
 research
 will
 focus
 on
 examining
 generalisability
of
 these
 findings
 to
 different
 years,
 patient
 samples,
 and
 poten-
tially
 different
 vaccinations.
 As
 suggested
 earlier,
 it
 is
 possible
 that
the
 best
 time
 of
 day
 for
 vaccination
 may
 be
 different
 for
 differ-
ent
 vaccines,
 as
 they
 stimulate
 different
 types
 of
 immune
 response
for
 protection,
 e.g.
 thymus-dependent
 versus
 thymus-independent
responses.
 These
 different
 types
 of
 response
 have
 been
 shown
 to
 be
differentially
 susceptible
 to
 behavioural
 factors
 such
 as
 stress
 [28],
thus
 it
 remains
 to
 be
 seen
 whether
 the
 different
 types
 of
 vaccine
would
 also
 be
 differentially
 susceptible
 to
 the
 impact
 of
 the
 timing

 Conclusions
 and
 implications
 for

In
 conclusion,
 this
 study
 provides
 preliminary
 evidence
 that
a
 simple
 and
 cost

 of
 the
 timing
 of
 vaccine
administration
 may
 improve
 protection
 from
 the

 if
