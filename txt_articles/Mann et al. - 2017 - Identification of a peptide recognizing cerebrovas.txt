Cerebrovascular changes occur in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Using in vivo phage display, we
searched for molecular markers of the neurovascular unit, including endothelial cells and
astrocytes, in mouse models of AD. We identified a cyclic peptide, CDAGRKQKC (DAG),
that accumulates in the hippocampus of hAPP-J20 mice at different ages. Intravenously
injected DAG peptide homes to neurovascular unit endothelial cells and to reactive astro-
cytes in mouse models of AD. We identified connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a
matricellular protein that is highly expressed in the brain of individuals with AD and in mouse
models, as the target of the DAG peptide. We also showed that exogenously delivered DAG
homes to the brain in mouse models of glioblastoma, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson’s
disease. DAG may potentially be used as a tool to enhance delivery of therapeutics and
imaging agents to sites of vascular changes and astrogliosis in diseases associated with
neuroinflammation.

 A
lzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common progressive
neurodegenerative
disorder
associated
with
aging.
The prevalent hypothesis regarding AD pathogenesis is
based on the premise that deposition of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ),
followed by hyperphosphorylated tau deposits, plays a key role in
neurodegeneration and brain atrophy in AD. However, failure to
demonstrate clinical efficacy by targeting Aβ1 in all but one recent
clinical study2, dictates the necessity of identifying additional
cellular pathways, processes, and molecules involved in AD
pathogenesis for diagnosis and treatment to improve clinical
outcomes.
Cerebrovascular changes in AD animal models and human
patients have been reported3,
4. These morphological and
functional changes can contribute to neuronal dysfunction and
neurodegeneration5. For instance, degeneration of blood-brain
barrier (BBB)-associated pericytes can lead to impairment of the
BBB6, 7, 8, resulting in serum buildup of proteins and edema9,
increase in reactive oxygen species10, and neuronal injury11.
However, this disruption in microvascular integrity also provides
a therapeutic opportunity to access the brain extravascular space
from the systemic circulation for delivering therapeutics and
imaging agents to the AD brain.
In vivo peptide phage display can be used for unbiased probing
of tissues in situ for specific molecular signatures, particularly in
the vasculature12. We have successfully utilized this technique to
discover homing peptides specific for different pathologies
including tumors, atherosclerotic plaques, wounds and severe
brain injury13–15. These homing peptides have been used to
selectively target drugs, antibodies, and nanoparticles into
pathological sites, and some peptides have advanced into clinical
trials14. Given the changes reported in the neurovascular unit in
AD, we conducted in vivo phage display to identify peptides that
specifically recognize molecular changes associated with AD
pathogenesis, and enable targeting of such sites from systemic
administration.

Fig. 1 Identification of DAG peptide by phage screening in transgenic mouse model of AD. Schematic representation of phage screening done in transgenic
hAPP-J20 tg mice a. A CX7C library (109 pfu) was injected intravenously in hAPP-J20 mice and wild-type (WT) littermate controls of different ages. After
30 min of circulation and perfusion to remove unbound phage, the hippocampus was excised and phages were recovered and quantified b. The phage DNA
was subjected to high-throughput sequencing, and the sequences present in the hAPP-J20 brains were compared to sequences from WT brains c. Analysis
of the hAPP-J20-specific sequences revealed a consensus motif, (A/G)BB(N/Q) (where B is basic). A cyclic 9-amino acid consensus peptide (red arrow)
containing this motif (sequence CDAGRKQKC; abbreviated “DAG”) was chemically synthesized. The DAG peptide was tested in the hAPP-J20 mice d and
in another AD model, Tg2576 mice e. FAM-labeled DAG peptide was intravenously injected into 9-month old hAPP-J20 and 18-month old Tg2576 mice
and allowed to circulate for 30 min. The mice were perfused, the brains were fixed, sectioned and stained with anti-FAM (green channel) to detect DAG
and with anti-CD31 (red channel) for blood vessels. Homing of DAG was mainly seen in the hippocampus of the J20 mice and in the cortex of the Tg2576
mice, partially co-localizing with blood vessels. n = 5 mice brains were examined from each model. Representative images are shown. Scale bars, 50 µm

 peptides with the general composition of CX7C (C = cysteine;
X = any amino acid) on the phage surface. The library was
injected intravenously into the hAPP-J20 transgenic mouse
model of AD16 and their age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates
in four different age groups (Fig. 1a). Four-fold higher phage
titers were recovered from the hippocampi of 9-month-old
hAPP-J20 than WT mice (Fig. 1b), whereas there was no sig-
nificant difference in the younger age groups. These results sug-
gest possible permeability of the BBB at 9 months of age, a time
when the hAPP-J20 mice have fully developed disease.
High throughput sequencing analysis of the peptide-encoding
region of the phage genome revealed peptide sequences that
were highly enriched in the phage pools from the 9-month-old
hAPP-J20 mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). Consensus motif analysis
across all of the age groups further showed that one sequence
motif, (A/G)BB(N/Q) (where B is a basic amino acid), was
enriched in all hAPP-J20 age groups, but absent in the WT
controls (Fig. 1c). One of the peptides in the 9-month phage pool
CDAGRKQKC (“DAG”) agreed with the consensus sequence and
contained the most commonly occurring amino acids in the
surrounding positions (Fig. 1c arrow). We focused subsequent
analyses on the DAG peptide because it contained the motif that
was present in peptides recovered from the hAPP-J20 mouse
hippocampus at all stages of AD, from onset at 3 months through
the late stage at 9 months of age (Fig. 1c).

prominent in the hAPP-J20 hippocampus than the cortex (Fig. 1d
and Supplementary Fig. 2). There was little if any accumulation of
the peptide in other organs of the hAPP-J20 mouse except for
kidney, probably due to the renal excretion of the peptide
(Supplementary Fig. 3). A control peptide for DAG, with the

(+2)
(sequence:
CRKQGEAKC) showed essentially no homing to the hippocam-
pus of hAPP-J20 mice of the same age (Fig. 1d, bottom panel),
thus, confirming DAG specificity for the hAPP-J20 brain. The
same specificity of DAG for AD was observed in the Tg2576
model (Fig. 1e) as the peptide was detected both in the
hippocampus and in the cortex (the region shown in the figure).
Further examination suggested that DAG labeled stellar-
shaped glial cells adjoining blood vessels, and also partially co-
localized with CD31-positive endothelial cell staining. The
Tg2576 model showed more pronounced endothelial localization
of DAG than hAPP-J20 (Figs. 1d, e, inset).
DAG targets activated astrocytes in AD mice. To identify the
cellular target of DAG in adult transgenic AD mouse brain,
we stained brain sections of DAG-injected hAPP-J20 mice with
cell-specific markers for neurons (NeuN), microglia (Iba1) and
reactive astrocytes (GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein). DAG
did not show co-localization with neurons or microglia (Sup-
plementary Fig. 4) but accumulated within a subpopulation of
GFAP-positive hypertrophic astrocytes surrounding the Aβ pla-
ques suggesting its specificity for activated (reactive) astrocytes
(Fig. 2a). In AD, astrocytes are known to become reactive,
particularly in the vicinity of amyloid plaques17. DAG accumu-
lation correlates with astrocyte distribution, rather than that of

 panel a). In addition to astrocyte cell bodies, extracellular DAG
accumulated in proximity to reactive astrocytes (Fig. 2a inset,
white arrows). A similar pattern of both cellular and extracellular
accumulation of DAG was observed in the brains of Tg2576 mice
injected intravenously with FAM-DAG (Supplementary Fig. 5).
The affinity of DAG for hAPP-J20 mouse astrocytes was
confirmed by ex vivo peptide binding to brain sections in an
overlay assay. DAG bound to a much greater degree in
the hippocampal region of hAPP-J20 mice than to age-matched
wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 6). As observed for in vivo
homing, DAG binding associated with GFAP positive astrocytes
surrounding Aβ plaques.
DAG targets endothelial cells in the cerebrocortex. We further
evaluated the strong vascular accumulation of DAG seen in
the Tg2576 model. Immunostaining on brain sections of
DAG-injected Tg2576 mice showed significant colocalization of
DAG with Aβ and the endothelial cell marker CD31 (Fig. 2b
inset, white arrowheads). Previous studies have shown that a
subset of Aβ peptides localize to small blood vessels in AD brain,
contributing to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)18. This
phenomenon is reported to be particularly pronounced in aged
Tg2576 mice19. Our data agree with those observations and show
that DAG targets Aβ−positive vessels in these mice.
DAG receptor identified as connective tissue growth factor. To
isolate the receptor for DAG, we identified an astrocytoma
cell line (U251) that exhibited binding of DAG peptide.
DAG-conjugated
silver
nanoparticles
(DAG-AgNP)
bound
robustly to these cells, much more so than non-targeted nano-
particles (Figure S7). The binding of DAG-AgNP to the
U251 cells was specific, as it was inhibited by co-incubation with
an excess of free, non-labeled DAG (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Next, we used U251 cell lysates for affinity chromatography
separation on a DAG-affinity matrix (schematic in Supplemen-
tary Fig. 8). Mass spectrometry on the fraction eluted with free
DAG peptide revealed a number of hits (listed in Supplementary
Table 1) one of which was connective tissue growth factor
(CTGF, also referred to as CCN2). CTGF is a member of the
CCN family of matricellular proteins that is induced in
inflammation and tissue repair20. We elected to focus initially
on CTGF among the hits from the affinity chromatography
because of the following considerations: (i) many of the candidate
receptors were cytoplasmic proteins or had no reported or
plausible connection to AD. (ii) CTGF is a heparin-binding
matricellular protein, which would make it available for peptide
binding
in
brain
extracellular
matrix
and
cell
surfaces.
(iii) Elevated expression of CTGF had been noted in small blood
vessels of AD patient brains21. In addition, elevated CTGF
expression takes place in various contexts of brain damage22–24.
Next, we analyzed CTGF expression in mouse brains and noted
significantly higher CTGF expression in hippocampus and
cerebrocortex of hAPP-J20 and Tg2576 mice than WT mice
(Supplementary Fig. 9). The elevated CTGF expression was
associated with GFAP-positive astrocytes in the transgenic mice
(Supplementary Fig. 10). In both AD transgenic mouse models,
DAG strongly homed to CTGF-positive areas localizing in stellate
shaped structures characteristic of astrocytes (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Fig. 11 respectively). The extracellular homing
observed in the hippocampus in close proximity to reactive
astrocytes we observed (Supplementary Fig. 5) is also in
agreement with the notion that a matricellular protein such as
CTGF is the DAG receptor.

 To further validate CTGF as a DAG receptor, we tested in vitro
binding of DAG to recombinant human CTGF. DAG bound to
CTGF-coated plates in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3b). A
control peptide showed only minimal binding, with no increase in
binding with increasing peptide concentration. Furthermore,
DAG binding to CTGF was inhibited in the presence of an excess
of unlabeled DAG, confirming the specificity. These data indicate
that CTGF is the DAG receptor in AD brain.
DAG detects vascular changes in early AD in mice. As the DAG
peptide was originally identified from phage screening that
spanned different ages of the J20 mice, we next tested DAG
homing in hAPP-J20 mice with early-stage AD (3–4 months of
age). We observed robust DAG homing in young hAPP-J20
animals, mostly in the cerebrocortex and the hippocampus
(Fig. 4a). At this age, DAG homing was predominantly found in
blood vessels, co-localizing with CD31. Additionally, the peptide
signal co-localized with GFAP-positive cells suggesting that it also
targeted astrocytes in the neurovascular unit (Fig. 4b). The
endothelial vessels were also positive for CTGF. Importantly, in
agreement with prior reports, we did not observe any Aβ
deposition at this early stage in this AD mouse model, which
indicates that the homing of DAG to AD brain is independent of
the presence of detectable amyloid deposits. Furthermore, DAG
homing at this stage seems to be independent of BBB leakage, as
no significant difference in the BBB permeability was observed
between hAPP-J20 and WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 12).

 was important to examine DAG for its ability to recognize human
AD samples. We tested DAG binding to cultured BBB-type
microvascular
endothelial
cells
(BMECs)
which
had
been
differentiated from
human induced pluripotent
stem cells
(hiPSCs) originally derived from AD patient fibroblasts (Sup-
plementary Fig. 13a). DAG conjugated silver nanoparticles
(DAG-AgNP) showed significant binding to the BMECS (Sup-
plementary Fig. 13d). This binding was specific as it was inhibited
by the presence of free DAG peptide (Supplementary Fig. 13e).
We also tested ex vivo binding of DAG to sections from an
AD human patient brain. DAG peptide bound strongly to
the hippocampal region, which also displayed abundant Aβ
oligomeric plaques (Fig. 5), whereas control peptide showed
minimal binding. We also observed strong CTGF immunor-
eactivity in the hippocampus in these sections (Fig. 5b). More-
over, DAG binding to these sections was partially inhibited by
pre-incubation with anti-CTGF antibody (Fig. 5c), confirming the
specificity of DAG binding to CTGF. DAG binding to the human
AD tissue coincided with regions with high GFAP expression
(Fig. 5c inset).
DAG-mediated payload delivery in AD. To demonstrate the
potential utility of DAG for site-specific delivery of payload
into AD brain, we synthesized DAG conjugated iron oxide
nanoparticles and tested the homing of intravenously adminis-
tered nanoparticles to the brain of 9 month-old hAPP-J20 mice.
We observed significant amount of nanoparticle delivery in the
hippocampus and cortex of hAPP-J20 mice (Supplementary
Fig. 14). No nanoparticle signal was observed in age-matched WT
mice. In addition, our earlier data on delivery of FAM label on the
DAG peptide and phage particles displaying DAG peptide further
demonstrate the ability of DAG to carry a payload to AD brains.
DAG homing in other models of neuroinflammation. Since
DAG targets activated astrocytes in AD, we tested in vivo homing
of systemically injected DAG in other models of neuroin-
flammation. Strong tumor homing of DAG was seen in P13
model of angiogenic glioblastoma, where the peptide co-localized
with a subset of the GFAP-positive cells (Fig. 6a). Similarly, in a
model of acute penetrating brain injury, DAG injected 6 h
after injury robustly homed to the perilesional area containing
activated hypertrophic astrocytes (Fig. 6b). Lastly, DAG also

 DAG targets activated astrocytes in both acute and chronic
models of neuroinflammation.
Discussion
We describe the application of in vivo phage display in mouse
models of AD for identification of peptides that target compo-
nents of the neurovascular unit. One of the peptides, DAG,
selectively recognizes a subset of astrocytes that are activated in
AD starting at an early stage of the disease. We also show that the
peptide recognizes activated astrocytes in other models of neu-
roinflammation. Importantly, the target of this peptide is
expressed both in mouse and human AD brain.
To our knowledge, this is the first application of in vivo phage
display to probe for specific, systemically accessible molecular
signatures present in the AD brain. The higher number of phage
recovered from brains of aged hAPP-J20 mice compared to age-
matched normal mice and younger hAPP-J20 mice is consistent
with the notion of a leaky BBB in late stages of the disease.
Vascular impairment represents an important factor in the
pathology of AD, particularly with dysfunction of components of
the neurovascular unit, and disruption of the BBB has been
widely reported in animal models of AD, as well as patients with
late-stage AD25, 26. Increased permeability of the BBB apparently
allows the phage to enter the subarachnoid space, which is nor-
mally not accessible, resulting in some phage binding to specific
extravascular targets. The DAG peptide identified in our screen
shows binding and accumulation in brain endothelia as well as in
the brain parenchyma. Binding of the DAG peptide to compo-
nents of the neurovascular unit (endothelial cells and astrocytes)

 in AD brain is of particular interest because the vasculature can
be readily accessed through the systemic circulation. However,
while DAG accumulated in the brain endothelial cells and
astrocytes in both models we tested, the extent of accumulation in
these cell types was different in the two models. It is difficult to
suggest possible reasons for the difference because the two models
differ from one another in a number of ways, including the APP
mutation, the promoter driving the APP production, and the age
of onset of the disease.
The homing pattern of DAG also differed depending on the
stage of AD. In the hAPP-J20 model, the homing was vascular at
the early stage of AD and extravascular later on. The reason for
this difference could be limited accessibility through an intact
BBB at the early stage, or a change in expression pattern of the
DAG receptor at different stages of AD, or both. Vascular
alterations in AD have been reported, even at early stages of the
disease3, 4, 26. Moreover, early in the disease, neuroinflammation
and synaptic/neuronal loss precede Aβ plaque deposition and tau
tangle formation, hallmarks of late stage AD27. Our data showing
DAG homing to early stage AD in the hAPP-J20 mouse model
indicate that the peptide recognizes an early change in the neu-
rovascular niche.
It was important to rule out the possibility that BBB leakage
was the reason for the in vivo brain accumulation of DAG in the
AD mice. We found that the binding of the peptide to brain
sections was independent of access through the BBB. DAG
binding to hAPP-J20 brain sections was far stronger than DAG
binding to WT brain or a control peptide binding to hAPP-J20
brain. These results suggest that upregulation of the DAG target
molecule is a factor in the preferential homing of systemically
injected DAG to AD brain. While BBB permeability is likely
needed for DAG to reach extravascular targets, the blood vessels
should be available for DAG binding regardless of the status of
the BBB. Our results on the DAG target molecule discussed below
confirm these conclusions.
We provide evidence that CTGF is the target molecule
for DAG. CTGF is a matricellular protein that acts as a regulator
of several cellular functions, including cell adhesion, migration,
mitogenesis, differentiation, and survival28. CTGF was one
of several candidate proteins that we identified from DAG
affinity chromatography, and we focused on it as a candidate
receptor
for
DAG
because
high
CTGF
expression
has
been reported in activated astrocytes in the brains of human
AD patients21. We also found high CTGF expression in AD
brains, both human and mouse. In addition, we found that the
endothelial cells and adjoining astrocytes in hAPP-J20 mouse
brain were positive for CTGF immunostaining, in agreement
with the observation of accumulation of systemically injected
DAG in these cells. Further evidence for CTGF as the
DAG receptor includes direct binding of FAM-labeled DAG to
recombinant CTGF and inhibition of the binding with unlabeled
DAG. Moreover, the binding of CTGF to extracellular matrices
creates an insoluble fraction of the growth factor that can
immobilize the peptide binding to it. Based on these data,
we conclude that CTGF is the receptor for DAG. Future studies
are needed to address the possible effects of DAG binding on
CTGF function.
DAG seemed to colocalize with Aβ in late stage AD, raising the
question as to whether DAG might bind to Aβ. However, CTGF
is secreted by reactive astrocytes21, the main target of DAG
homing, and reactive astrocytes surround Aβ deposits, creating an
impression of DAG colocalization with Aβ. Closer examination
showed that DAG is associated with the astrocytes and not Aβ.
Moreover, DAG homing in models with no Aβ deposition such as
early stage hAPP-J20 mice, and Parkinson’s and glioblastoma
mice indicates that Aβ deposition is not necessary for DAG
homing. Rather, DAG homing seems to be only dependent on
astrocyte activation and CTGF expression.
Since we initially identified the DAG peptide using mouse
models of AD, it was important to determine if the peptide also
recognizes the human AD tissue. Our results show that in fact it
does. First, DAG binds to human CTGF, as shown by the binding
of DAG to the U251 human astrocytoma cells we used as the
source of stating material for the identification of CTGF as the
DAG receptor. Second, the recombinant CTGF that we used to
show the binding of DAG to CTGF was of human origin. Third,
DAG specifically bound to human AD iPS cells differentiated into
BBB-type endothelial cells. Finally, DAG bound to human AD
brain sections in an overlay assay. Taken together with the
demonstration of elevated CTGF expression in human AD brain,
these results show that DAG is relevant to human AD.
Studies have reported CTGF up-regulation in patients with
conditions other than AD that have a neuroinflammatory com-
ponent, such as Parkinson’s disease29, brain injury24, glio-
blastoma30, and cerebral infarction31. Given its potential to
modulate the cellular phenotype and remodel tissue in the CNS
following injury and in neurodegenerative disease, CTGF may
represent an attractive therapeutic target. The fact that DAG
homes to brain in animal models of Parkinson’s disease, brain
injury, and glioblastoma agrees with the published CTGF
expression pattern and suggests that DAG has the potential for
broad applicability in brain diseases. Our data on DAG mediated
delivery of nanoparticle payload to AD brains supports the
concept of utilizing DAG for imaging applications, in which the
differential diagnosis could be based on the pattern of accumu-
lation of the DAG-guided contrast agent. A particularly attractive
potential application of DAG would be as a biomarker for early
detection of AD, as suggested by DAG homing to AD brain
vessels at early stages of disease in the hAPP-J20 mouse model.
In conclusion, the DAG peptide provides a tool for targeting of
the neurovascular unit to improve imaging and management of
neuroinflammatory conditions. It also draws attention to the
potential role of CTGF in AD and other neurological diseases,
which heretofore has been essentially unexplored.
Methods
Animal models. All animal experiments were conducted under an approved
protocol of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sanford Burnham
Prebys Medical Discovery Institute. The following transgenic mouse models were
used for peptide homing studies - hAPP-J2016, Tg257632, and mTHY-1-α-synu-
clein model33. All three models are derived from C57BL/6 mice and were used at
ages described in the specific experiment. The P13 glioblastoma model is a patient-
derived orthotopic xenograft model34 received from Dr. Rolf Bjerkvig´s lab
(NORLUX Neuro-Oncology, Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen,
Norway). Spheroids were cultured as described previously35. After two weeks in
culture, spheroids (volume 2.5 µl) were stereotactically implanted into the brains of
nude mice. Mice were used approximately 6 weeks after tumors were induced,
when mice started presenting neurological symptoms. The acute brain injury
model was setup as previously described15. Briefly, 8 to 10 week-old male BL6 mice
were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane in 70% N2O and 30% O2, and a 5-mm
craniotomy was performed using a portable drill and a trephine over the right
parietotemporal cortex using a stereotactic frame. The bone flap was removed and
nine needle punctures using a 21 G needle were made 3 mm deep according to a
3 × 3 grid, spaced 1 mm in width and 1 mm in height. The scalp was then closed
with sutures, anesthesia discontinued and mice were administered buprenorphine i.
p. for pain control.
In vivo phage display. The in vivo phage screening in hAPP-J20 mice was done as
described12. A CX7 C naïve phage library (1e10 pfu of, in 100 µL of PBS) was
intravenously injected and allowed to circulate for 30 minutes due to its short half-
life, after which mice were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin and perfused with PBS
intracardially. The brain was removed and the hippocampus was extracted and
homogenized in LB-NP 40 (1%) and phage was processed as described12. The
phages in the lysate were rescued by amplification in E.coli and peptide-encoding
portion of the phage genome was sequenced using Ion Torrent high throughput
sequencing.

 Homing studies and tissue sections. For peptide homing, mice were intrave-
nously injected with 50 nmoles of peptide dissolved in PBS, and allowed to cir-
culate for 30 min. Mice were then perfused intracardially with saline and all major
organs were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at pH 7.4 overnight.
The organs were then washed with PBS and placed in graded sucrose solutions
overnight before optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) embedding. Ten-
micro-meter-thick sections were cut and analyzed by immunostaining.
Peptide synthesis and coupling. The peptides were synthesized on a microwave-
assisted automated peptide synthesizer (Liberty; CEM, Matthews, NC) following
Fmoc/t-Bu (Fmoc:Fluorenyl methoxy carbonyl, t-Bu: tertiary-butyl) strategy on
rink amide resin with HBTU (N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethyl-O-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)
uranium hexafluorophosphate (OR) O-(Benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetra-
methyluronium hexafluorophosphate) activator, collidine activator base and 5%
piperazine for deprotection. Fluorescein and biotin tags were incorporated during
synthesis at the N-terminus of the sequence. Cleavage using a 95% TFA Trifluoro
acetic acid followed by purification gave peptides with > 90% purity. Peptides were
lyophilized and stored at -20 °C.
ELISA. To demonstrate the specific binding of DAG peptide to its receptor, ELISA
plate wells were coated with full-length recombinant human CTGF/CCN2 (R&D
systems; cat#9190-CC) at a concentration of 5 μ/ml for 2–3 h at room temperature.
The wells were washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween-20 (“PBST”), and
blocked with 1% (w/v) Casein in PBST (Thermo Scientific; cat# 37582) for 2 h at
room temperature. 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein label (FAM)- DAG or the control
peptide diluted in 0.05% Casein/PBST were added to the respective wells and
incubated overnight at 4 °C with shaking. For competition experiment, excess of
unlabeled DAG peptide (0.6 mM) was added in the solution. After washing wells
one time with PBS (containing 300 mM NaCl) and twice with PBST, 100 μl of anti-
FITC HRP conjugated polyclonal antibody (GeneTex #GTX26656) diluted
(1:10,000) in 0.05% Casein/PBST was added to the wells and incubated with
shaking for 30 min at RT. The wells were finally washed there times with PBST and
plate was developed with TMB substrate (3, 3′, 5, 5′-Tetramethylbenzidine)
(Sigma) for 20 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of equal volume of
1 M sulphuric acid and absorbance measured at 450 nm (FlexStation 3 Reader,
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Tissue section overlays of FAM labeled peptides. PFA fixed sections were
incubated in PBS for 10 minutes, followed by PBS-Triton-x-100 (0.2%) for
10 minutes. Sections were rinsed with PBST, mounted in a slide holder, and sub-
sequently washed with PBST (3 washes of 4 minutes each). Slides were blocked
with blocking buffer for 60 minutes at room temperature. Then, peptides were
incubated at a concentration of 10 µg/mL dissolved in concentrated blocking
buffer, for three hours at room temperature. Sections were then washed with three
4-minute washes of PBST, and subsequently fixed with PFA for 10 minutes, fol-
lowed by three 3-minute washes with PBST. Sections were then incubated with
primary antibody at 1/200 in diluted blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Later,
sections were washed with three 4-minute washes with PBST. Slides were then
incubated with secondary antibody at 1/200 dilution in diluted blocking buffer for
30 minutes at room temperature, followed by three 4-minute washes of PBST.
Sections were then counterstained with DAPI for 5 minutes, washed with PBST
and mounted.
Immunofluorescence. Frozen sections were permeabilized using PBS- 0.2%Triton
X-100, blocking was carried out using blocking buffer (5% BSA, 1% goat serum, 1%
donkey serum in PBST. Primary antibodies were incubated in diluted (1%)
blocking buffer overnight at dilutions 1/100 or 1/200 at 4 °C, washed with PBST
and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1/200 or 1/500 in 1% diluted
buffer for 1 h at room temperature, subsequently washed with PBST, counter-
stained with DAPI 1 µg/mL in PBS for 5 minutes, washed with PBS, mounted using
aqueous mounting media (Vector Biolabs), and imaged using a confocal micro-
scope (Zeiss LSM-710). Staining was done using the following antibodies and
reagents: anti-fluorescein (Invitrogen A889; 1:100), CD31 (BD Biosciences clone
MEC 13.3; 1:50), aβ (Sigma clone 6E10; 1:200), GFAP (Invitrogen clone 2.2B10;
1:400), CTGF (Santa Cruz, clone C-19; 1:100), Iba 1 (Wako Chemicals, 019-19741;
1:200), NeuN (Abcam, ab177487, 1:200).
Affinity chromatography and proteomics. For identifying DAG binding proteins,
the human glioblastoma astrocytoma cell line U251 was lysed in PBS containing
200 mM n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) as
described previously15, 36 with slight modifications. The clarified lysates were
loaded on to Sera-Mag magnetic particles (GE Healthcare Lifesciences, USA)
coated with biotin-DAG, and incubated overnight with rotation at 4 °C. The
magnetic beads were washed with wash buffer followed by additional washing with
0.5 mM control peptide (CRKQGEAKC) to remove non-specifically bound pro-
teins. The bound proteins were eluted with 1 mM free DAG peptide. The eluted
fractions were pooled, their protein concentration determined by using bicincho-
ninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce) and the samples were digested using the
Filter-aided Sample Preparation (FASP) method37. Finally, the digested samples
were dried, desalted and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis at the Sanford Burnham
Prebys Medical Discovery Institute’s Proteomics Core facility. All mass spectra
were analyzed with MaxQuant software version 1.5.0.25. The MS/MS spectra were
searched against the Uniprot protein sequence database (version July 2014). The
proteomics data and detailed method has been deposited to MassIVE repository
(accession MSV000081390).
Generation of brain microvascular endothelial cells from hiPSCs. Human
induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were generated following approval from
the Stem Cell Research Oversight committee of Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical
Discovery Institute. The details of hiPSCs derived from Alzheimer disease patients
with APP duplication, and non-demented control individuals, are described pre-
viously38. These hiPSCs were extensively characterized and have been established
as an excellent human model for AD. An additional AD hiPSC line generated from
dermal fibroblasts from a 56-year-old individual harboring a Presenilin1 (PSEN1)
mutation (Coriell Institute, Cat # AG06840) was used to further validate the results
from the APP lines. We routinely maintain hiPSCs on mouse embryonic fibroblast
as described before39, 40. Brain microvascular endothelial cells differentiation of
hiPSCs was performed using a previously described protocol41, with minor mod-
ifications. Briefly, feeder-free cultures of hiPSCs were allowed to spontaneously
differentiate in the absence of bFGF for 5–7 days, and then transferred to Endo-
thelial cell (EC) medium composed of human Endothelial Serum-Free Medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 ng/ml bFGF and 1% platelet-poor plasma-
derived bovine serum (PDS; Biomedical Technologies). After 1–2 days the cells
were dissociated with dispase (2 mg/ml) and were plated on 12 well plates coated
with a mixture of collagen IV (400 µg/ml) and fibronectin (100 µg/ml). Cells were
then cultured in EC medium until they reached confluence, after which they were
split and expanded to near 100% purity. BBB-type EC identity was confirmed by
double immunoreactivity to the hallmark efflux transporter p-glycoprotein and
other EC markers (CD31, GLUT-1, PECAM, Occludin, and Claudin-5). Further-
more, the capability of these cells to make functional tight junctions and polarized
efflux activity was validated using a dual chamber efflux transport assay as
described before41.
Nanoparticles synthesis and peptide conjugation. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
with PEG coating and peptide functionality were prepared as reported previously
with some modifications42. AgNPs of ~35 nm diameter were synthesized by citrate
acid reduction of silver nitrate in solution43. First, AgNO3 (450 mg) dissolved in
2.5 L water was stirred and heated to a boil and 50 mL water containing trisodium
citrate dihydrate (500 mg, Sigma) was added. After 30 min the solution was cooled
to room temperature. The resulting optical density at 405 nm was ~10. To install
the coating, lipoic PEG amine (LPN, 51.9 mg, 3400 g/mol, Nanocs) was dissolved
and reduced for 3 h in 4.1 mL of aqueous 84 mM tris-carboxylethyl phosphine pH
7.0 (Sigma). AgNPs (500 mL) were heated to 50 °C and LPN solution (0.79 mL)
was added, followed by 0.25 mL of 0.5 M TCEP. After 30 min incubation the
solution was cooled to room temperature (RT) forming LPN-AgNPs. Tween 20
(T20, 0.25 mL, 10% in water) and 20 mL 2 M NaCl were sequentially added to the
LPN-AgNPs and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Using a stirred cell apparatus
(Millipore) equipped with a 100 kDa membrane LPN-AgNPs were washed and
concentrated 50-fold into 0.5X PBS with 0.005% T20 and 5 mM TCEP. LPN-
AgNPs were further passivated by adding 0.03 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine methyl
ester (Sigma) for 2 h, followed by 0.10 mM tetracysteine peptide (acetyl-CCPGCC-
amide, LifeTein) for 2 h. LPN-AgNPs were washed twice at 15k RCF and resus-
pended to 400 O.D. (optical density) in 0.05 M phosphate buffer with 0.005% T20
pH 7.3. This product could be stored at least 6 months at 4 °C. To attach peptide, a
bifunctional linker was reacted with 1 mL of the LPN-AgNPs to introduce mal-
eimide groups (10 mg, NHS-PEG-Mal, 2 kDa JenKem USA, 1 h at RT), then
washed with 0.1 M HEPES buffer pH 7.2 0.005% T20 by centrifugation (4 C, 11 kxg
15 min, three times), and immediately reacted for 1 h with freshly dissolved
cysteine peptide (final concentration ~0.1 mM FAM-cys-x-DAG-NH2) or a control
thiol-containing peptide. X indicates aminohexanoic acid linker. The product
peptide-AgNPs were washed with PBS 0.005% T20 (PBST), then filtered (0.22 µm).
The Ag plasmon peak was 300 O.D. at 405 nm. We estimated ~15 nM in AgNPs
using an extinction coefficient of 2 × 10^10 M−1 cm−1 for spherical silver obtained
from44. The synthesis and subsequent conjugation of iron oxide nanoparticles
(termed nanoworms (NW) has been described45. For peptide coupling, aminated
NWs were PEGylated with maleimide-5KPEG-NHS (JenKem Technology) and
DAG peptide containing an extra cysteine was conjugated to the functionalized
particles through a thioether bond between the cysteine thiol in the peptide and the
maleimide on the NW.
In vitro binding experiments. Cell binding experiments on U251 cells and hiPSCs
were done using peptide conjugated AgNP. U251 cells were cultured in a
96-well plate. The cells were blocked with 200 µl of 10% FCS in HBSS (Hanks’
Balanced Salt Solution from Gibco) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following that, DAG-
AgNPs (0.5 nM concentration diluted in HBSS) alone or in the presence of free
non-labeled peptide (200 µM) were incubated on the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. After
washing the unbound AgNP with HBSS three times, the plates were imaged with
fluorescent microscopy by looking at intrinsic emission from the FAM tag on the

 peptide. hiPSCs were cultured in 48 well plate and similar protocol as described
above was followed, with the exception that AgNP concentration for incubation
was kept at 0.15 nM. Nanoparticle binding was quantified from fluorescence
micrographs using ImageJ software.
Human tissue experiments. Postmortem human brain tissue was obtained from
the New York Brain Bank at Columbia University, New York. The patient was an
82-year-old male with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic changes
([A3, B3, C3]). The normal brain tissue was obtained from BioChain Institute Inc.
(Newark, CA). The donor was a 54 year-old male without any neurologic diagnosis
on detailed neuropathologic evaluation. The Parkinson’s disease brain tissue was
obtained from UCSD Pathology bank. Informed consent was obtained for all
autopsies. Frozen brain tissue was sectioned for immunohistochemistry and ex vivo
overlay binding with FAM-peptides.
Statistical analysis. All data represents mean value ± SEM. All the significance
analysis was done using Statistica 8.0 software, using one-way ANOVA or two-
tailed heteroscedastic Student’s t test. The details of the statistical tests carried out
are indicated in respective figure legends.
