Summary
Background Obesity increases the risk of several chronic diseases, but the extent to which the obesity-related loss of 
disease-free years varies by lifestyle category and across socioeconomic groups is unclear. We estimated the number 
of years free from major non-communicable diseases in adults who are overweight and obese, compared with those 
who are normal weight.
Methods We pooled individual-level data on body-mass index (BMI) and non-communicable diseases from men and 
women with no initial evidence of these diseases in European cohort studies from the Individual-Participant-Data 
Meta-Analysis in Working Populations consortium. BMI was assessed at baseline (1991–2008) and non-communicable 
diseases (incident type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease) were ascertained via linkage to records from national health registries, repeated medical examinations, or 
self-report. Disease-free years from age 40 years to 75 years associated with underweight (BMI <18·5 kg/m²), 
overweight (≥25 kg/m² to <30 kg/m²), and obesity (class I [mild] ≥30 kg/m² to <35 kg/m²; class II–III [severe] 
≥35 kg/m²) compared with normal weight (≥18·5 kg/m² to <25 kg/m²) were estimated. 
Findings Of 137 503 participants from ten studies, we excluded 6973 owing to missing data and 10 349 with prevalent 
disease at baseline, resulting in an analytic sample of 120 181 participants. Of 47 127 men, 211 (0·4%) were underweight, 
21 468 (45·6%) normal weight, 20 738 (44·0%) overweight, 3982 (8·4%) class I obese, and 728 (1·5%) class II–III obese. 
The corresponding numbers among the 73 054 women were 1493 (2·0%), 44 760 (61·3%), 19 553 (26·8%), 5670 (7·8%), 
and 1578 (2·2%), respectively. During 1 328 873 person-years at risk (mean follow-up 11·5 years [range 6·3–18·6]), 
8159 men and 8100 women developed at least one non-communicable disease. Between 40 years and 75 years, the 
estimated number of disease-free years was 29·3 (95% CI 28·8–29·8) in normal-weight men and 29·4 (28·7–30·0) in 
normal-weight women. Compared with normal weight, the loss of disease-free years in men was 1·8 (95% CI –1·3 to 4·9) 
for underweight, 1·1 (0·7 to 1·5) for overweight, 3·9 (2·9 to 4·9) for class I obese, and 8·5 (7·1 to 9·8) for class II–III obese. 
The corresponding estimates for women were 0·0 (–1·4 to 1·4) for underweight, 1·1 (0·6 to 1·5) for overweight, 
2·7 (1·5 to 3·9) for class I obese, and 7·3 (6·1 to 8·6) for class II–III obese. The loss of disease-free years associated with 
class II–III obesity varied between 7·1 and 10·0 years in subgroups of participants of different socioeconomic level, 
physical activity level, and smoking habit.
Interpretation Mild obesity was associated with the loss of one in ten, and severe obesity the loss of one in four 
potential disease-free years during middle and later adulthood. This increasing loss of disease-free years as obesity 
becomes more severe occurred in both sexes, among smokers and non-smokers, the physically active and inactive, 
and across the socioeconomic hierarchy.

Introduction
Obesity is a growing public health problem.1,2 In 2016, 
more than 1·9 billion adults worldwide were overweight 
and 650 million were obese, vastly outnumbering those 
who were normal weight.3 In addition to reducing quality 
of life4 and life expectancy,5 obesity is associated with an 
elevated risk of several major non-communicable 
diseases, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart 
disease, stroke, asthma, and several cancers.6–8 Early 
studies suggested that metabolically healthy obesity, 
especially when combined with a high level of fitness, is 
associated with only a minimal increase in disease risk,9 
but more recent longitudinal studies have shown that 
when examining individual change over time, healthy 
obese adults show a strong tendency to progress to an 
unhealthy obese state.10,11

Several studies have documented associations between 
obesity and risk of major non-communicable diseases, 
based on risk relative to normal weight using body-mass 
index (BMI) categories. By contrast, few studies have 
quantified such associations using absolute metrics such 
as disease-free years.5,12–15 Furthermore, those that have 
used absolute metrics have tended to use narrow and 
varying definitions of disease-free years, such as free 
of cardiovascular disease12,14,15 or free of cardiometabolic 
disease,5 or have been based on mainly self-reported data.13 
Given this heterogeneity in the definition of disease-free 
years and assessment methodology, the loss of years free 
of major non-communicable diseases attributable to 
overweight and obesity remains ill defined. Physical 
exertion might mitigate the adverse effects of obesity,16–18 
but to our knowledge no study has estimated the extent to 
which physical activity helps to decrease the obesity-
related loss of disease-free years. Similarly for smoking 
habits and socioeconomic position, evidence is sparse.
In the present study, we aimed to calculate the loss of 
disease-free years in adults who are overweight and 
obese, compared with those who are normal weight. 
Methods
Study population
We used data from independent European studies 
from the Individual-Participant-Data Meta-Analysis in 
Working Populations (IPD-Work) consortium.19 All 
participating cohort studies have been approved by local 
ethics committees, and details of study designs and 
participants are described in the appendix (pp 2–4). 
Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants.
Procedures
We calculated BMI as weight in kg divided by height in m². 
Participants with missing values for height or weight or 
BMI values less than 15 kg/m² or more than 50 kg/m² 
were excluded, as per previous analyses. We classified BMI 
into five categories according to WHO recommendations: 
underweight (<18·5 kg/m²), normal weight (≥18·5 kg/m² 
to <25 kg/m²), overweight (≥25 kg/m² to <30 kg/m²), 
class I (mild) obesity (≥30 kg/m² to <35 kg/m²), and 
class II–III (severe) obesity (≥35 kg/m²).
Socioeconomic group was based on occupational title 
obtained from employers’ or other registers or question-
naires completed by participants or self-reported highest 
educational qualification. For each study, socioeconomic 
group was categorised as high (e.g. professionals or 
executives), intermediate (e.g. skilled non-manual workers), 
or low (e.g. manual workers; appendix p 4).
Individuals were classified as never, former, or current 
smokers on the basis of information extracted from 
participant questionnaires in all studies. Physical activity 
at baseline was self-reported and participants were 
categorised as physically active if they engaged in at least 
moderate levels of activity, and inactive otherwise. A 
detailed description of the baseline assessment is 
available in the appendix (pp 3–4).
Linked records of non-communicable diseases covered 
both baseline and follow-up. The outcome of interest 
was the first record of incident type 2 diabetes, coronary 
heart disease, stroke, cancer, asthma, or chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), because these 
are the commonest major non-communicable diseases 
in develop 
ed countries.20 These non-communicable 
diseases are also targets prioritised for global disease 
prevention by WHO.
Type 2 diabetes was identified via hospital discharge 
registers and mortality registers as the appearance of 
E11 (International Classification of Diseases, revision 
10 [ICD-10]) or 250 (ICD-9) in any of the diagnosis codes; 
2-h oral glucose tolerance tests administered every 
5 years (fasting glucose ≥7·0 mmol/L or 2-h post-load

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched for studies examining the association between 
obesity and disease-free years in PubMed and Embase, without 
language or date restrictions up to March 1, 2018, using the 
terms “obesity”, “body mass index”, “healthy years”, “healthy 
life-years”, “disease-free years”, “disease-free life expectancy”, 
“healthy life expectancy”, “life expectancy”. We found evidence 
linking obesity with increased risk of single chronic conditions, 
but few studies quantified the mean number of disease-free 
years that obese individuals lose compared with those of 
healthy weight.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the largest study so far to examine the 
association between obesity and loss of disease-free years due to 
major non-communicable diseases and how this association 
varies by lifestyle category and socioeconomics. We found that 
mild obesity was associated with a loss of one in ten and severe 
obesity a loss of one in four potential disease-free years between 
40 years and 75 years. In both sexes, overweight participants lost 
1 disease-free year, the mildly obese 3–4 years, and the severely 
obese 7–8 years compared with normal-weight participants. 
Severe obesity was associated with a loss of 7–10 disease-free 
years in active and inactive individuals; current, past, and never 
smokers; and those of high and low socioeconomic position.
Implications of all the available evidence
Quantifying the number of obesity-related disease-free years 
lost is important for the development of prevention strategies 
for major non-communicable chronic diseases in health policies 
and clinical guidelines. Our findings suggest that the substantial 
loss of disease-free years associated with obesity is evident 
across the social hierarchy and irrespective of lifestyle factors, 
such as physical activity and smoking.

glucose ≥11·1 mmol/L); the first time the participant 
appeared in the nationwide drug reimbursement register 
as eligible for medication for this condition; or self-report 
from annual questionnaires.
Coronary heart disease was identified from hospital 
discharge and mortality registers, annual self-report 
questionnaires, or clinical screening using WHO Multi-
national Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in 
Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) Project criteria.21 We 
included all non-fatal myocardial infarctions recorded as 
I21–I22 (ICD-10) or 410 (ICD-9), and coronary deaths 
I20–I25 (ICD-10) and 410–414 (ICD-9) in the diagnosis 
codes. Incident stroke was ascertained via hospital and 
mortality records: I60, I61, I63, and I64 (ICD-10); and 430, 
431, 433, 434, and 436 (ICD-9).
Cancers, C00–C97 (ICD-10 any cancer), were identified 
via national cancer or mortality registers, the employer’s 
medical register, or by confirming any self-reported 
cancer diagnosis with the participant’s physician. Severe 
asthma (J45 or J46 in ICD-10 or 493 in ICD-9) in any 
diagnostic code and COPD exacerbations (J41, J42, J43, 
and J44 in ICD-10, or 491, 492, and 496 in ICD-9) were 
ascertained from hospital discharge and death registers 
in all studies except for one study, in which non-fatal 
cancer and asthma events were based on self-report 
from annual questionnaires and non-fatal COPD was 
not available. Detailed descriptions of the outcome 
measurements are available in the appendix (pp 6–7).
Participants with missing data on outcomes and those 
with a record of any of these diseases already at baseline 
were excluded from the analyses. We also excluded 
participants with a record of type 1 diabetes at baseline: 
E10 (ICD-10) or 250 (ICD-9 and ICD-8).22
Statistical analysis
We did all analyses separately for men and women. 
Disease-free years were defined as the number of life-
years between ages 40 years and 75 years free from 
diagnosis of any of the non-communicable diseases 
examined. To estimate the association between BMI 
category and disease-free years, hazard ratios (HRs) with 
95% CIs for the first disease were calculated using flexible 
parametric survival models on the cumulative hazards 
scale.23 Restricted cubic splines were fitted within these 
models to model the baseline hazard for each BMI 
category using age as the timescale. Disease-free years 
lost associated with overweight and obesity compared 
with normal weight were calculated as the difference 
between the areas under the disease-free survival curves 
from ages 40 years to 75 years. Area under the curve was 
computed via numerical integration with a spline-based 
method. Disease-free years were estimated conditional on 
survival to age 40 years without any of the six major non-
communicable diseases investigated. We chose 40 years 
because this is typically the age at which health checks, 
monitoring of specific cancers, and assessment of risk 
of chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, 
commences.24–26 CIs for disease-free years were estimated 
via bootstrapping using 1000 independent replications. 
We used two-stage meta-analysis to combine the results. 
The results were first calculated separately within each 
study (first stage), then the study-specific results were 
pooled using random effects meta-analysis (second stage). 
Heterogeneity between cohorts was assessed with the 
I² statistic.
To examine effect modification, we stratified the 
analyses by categories of physical activity, smoking, and 
socioeconomic position. To achieve sufficient power for 
these subgroup analyses, we pooled the data and used 
study identifier as a covariate in the model. A sensitivity 
analysis was done for the main model, comparing the 
results of the pooled analyses to those obtained from the 
two-stage models to justify data pooling.
Data were analysed using Stata/MP 13.1, packages 
stpm2 and metan.27,28

Results
Of the 18 IPD-Work cohort studies, eight were excluded 
owing to missing data on exposure or outcome, or 
insufficient data (to ensure participant confidentiality) for 
the analyses (figure 1). Study baseline varied between 
1991 and 2008 depending on the cohort. Of the 
137 503 participants from ten IPD-Work cohort studies, we 
excluded 6973 owing to missing data on age, sex, BMI, or 
any of the non-communicable diseases investigated and 
10 349 with a recorded history of these diseases at baseline, 
resulting in an analytic sample of 120 181 participants 
(figure 1). 73 054 (60·8%) participants were women and 
47 127 (39·2%) were men. Mean age at baseline was 
44·6 years (SD 9·7) for men and 43·4 years (9·9) for 
women. For men, mean BMI was 25·7 kg/m² (SD 3·4), 
with 211 (0·4%) underweight, 21 468 (45·6%) normal 
weight, 20 738 (44·0%) overweight, 3982 (8·4%) class I 
obese, and 728 (1·5%) class II–III obese. For women, 
mean BMI was 24·5 kg/m² (SD 4·0), with 1493 (2·0%) 
underweight, 44 760 (61·3%) normal weight, 19 553 (26·8%) 
overweight, 5670 (7·8%) class I obese, and 1578 (2·2%) 
class II–III obese. Other characteristics of the analytic 
sample are presented in the appendix (p 5).
Mean follow-up was 11·5 years (range between studies 
6·3–18·6), with 1 328 873 person-years at risk. 8159 men 
had at least one incident disease during 543 522 person-
years at risk; the corresponding figure was 8100 for 
women during 785 350 person-years at risk (appendix p 7).
Normal-weight men had a mean of 29·3 disease-free 
years (95% CI 28·8–29·8) between 40 years and 75 years 
(figure 2). The estimate for underweight participants was 
27·1 disease-free years (95% CI 23·8–30·3). In women, the 
corresponding estimates were 29·4 disease-free years 
(95% CI 28·7–30·0) for normal weight and 29·5 disease-
free years (27·9–31·0) for underweight.
Compared with normal weight, the loss of disease-free 
years for underweight was 1·8 (95% CI –1·3 to 4·9) in 
men and 0·0 (–1·4 to 1·4) for women. Above normal 
weight, the number of disease-free years diminished with 
increasing BMI category. Compared with normal-weight 
men, overweight men lost 1·1 disease-free years (95% CI 
0·7–1·5), class I obese men lost 3·9 disease-free years 
(2·9–4·9), and class II–III obese men lost 8·5 disease-
free years (7·1–9·8). The corresponding reductions for 
women were 1·1 disease-free years (95% CI 0·6–1·5) for 
overweight, 2·7 disease-free years (1·5–3·9) for obese

class I, and 7·3 disease-free years (6·1–8·6) for obese 
class II–III. The appendix (pp 8–9) provides study-specific 
estimates of the numbers of disease-free years by BMI 
category.
Supplementary and subgroup analyses are based on 
a pooled dataset and are shown in the appendix 
(pp 10–11, 14–15). Four studies (DWECS, IPAW, SLOSH, 
and HHS) were not included in the pooled dataset 
because no individual-level data were provided by the 
investigators. Obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking 
were socially patterned, with higher prevalences in lower 
socioeconomic groups (figure 3). Low socioeconomic 
group, smoking, and physical inactivity were associated 
with fewer disease-free years (figure 4).
To examine whether the association between BMI and 
disease-free years was independent of the effects of 
lifestyle risk factors and their socioeconomic patterning, 
stratified analyses were done. The association between 
BMI category and the loss of disease-free years was 
replicated at each level of the socioeconomic hierarchy 
(figure 5). Compared with normal-weight men, those 
with class II–III obesity lost 8·7 disease-free years 
(95% CI 6·0–11·4) among those in a high socioeconomic 
position and 7·8 disease-free years (6·0–9·5) among 
those in a low socioeconomic position. Corresponding 
losses in class II–III obese women were 8·3 disease-free 
years (95% CI 6·1–10·6) for high and 8·0 disease-free 
years (6·5–9·5) for low socioeconomic position 
participants.

among class II–III obese men were 9·3 disease-free 
years (95% CI 7·6–11·0) for past smokers and 7·1 disease-
free years (4·8–9·3) for never smokers. Among 
class II–III obese women compared with normal weight, 
current smokers lost 8·9 disease-free years (95% CI 
6·8–11·0), past smokers lost 9·3 disease-free years 
(7·9–10·7), and never smokers lost 9·2 disease-free years 
(7·5–10·8).
Compared with normal-weight men, those with 
class II–III obesity who were physically active lost 
8·0 disease-free years (95% CI 6·4–9·6) and inactive 
men lost 8·8 disease-free years (7·2–10·4; figure 5). 
Corresponding losses in class II–III obese women were 
7·7 disease-free years (95% CI 6·5–8·9) for physically 
active and 8·4 disease-free years (7·2–9·7) for inactive 
participants.
Discussion
Our results from over 120 000 Europeans show that, 
compared with normal weight, both mild and severe 
obesity are associated with a significant reduction in 
disease-free years between 40 years and 75 years. This 
finding was observed in both sexes, smokers and non-
smokers, active and inactive people, and across the social 
hierarchy, suggesting that this association is ubiquitous 
and not limited to any specific group of people. Compared 
with their normal-weight counterparts, severely obese 
men and women lost about 7–8 disease-free years, whereas 
those who were mildly obese lost 3–4 disease-free years, 
and those who were overweight lost 1·1 disease-free years. 
Our findings suggest that mildly obese individuals lose 
one in ten and the severely obese one in four potential 
disease-free life-years during middle and later adulthood.
We observed socioeconomic gradients in obesity, 
physical activity, and smoking, in both men and women. 
Similarly, we observed strong associations between 
disease-free years and socioeconomic position, physical 
activity, and smoking. Despite these relationships, loss of 
disease-free years associated with obesity varied little 
between socioeconomic groups and those with more and 
less favourable lifestyle factors. The loss of disease-free 
years associated with class I obesity was about 4 years in 
both physically active and inactive participants and varied 
between 2 years and 5 years among current smokers, past 
smokers, and non-smokers and those from high and low 
socioeconomic backgrounds. The loss of disease-free 
years associated with class II–III obesity was greater, 
between 7 years and 10 years, among participants with 
different physical activity levels, smoking habits, and 
socioeconomic positions. These findings suggest that the 
link between BMI and the number of disease-free years is 
robust, adding to previous evidence on the adverse 
associations of obesity on disease-free lifespan.5,12–15
Our analyses benefit from the large sample size and the 
fact that in nine of the ten studies non-communicable 
diseases were defined using electronic health records from 
national health registers. At least one previous multicohort 
study13 has reported a link between obesity and the loss of 
expected disease-free years, although that study was 
smaller, defined the outcome based on self-rated data, did 
not report summary data from the four studies included, 
and covered a shorter age range (50–75 years). Several 
other studies have also concluded that obese adults have 
fewer disease-free years than normal-weight adults.5,12,15 
One exception is a study of 19 420 adults, which found that 
overweight was associated with a greater number of 
disease-free years compared with normal weight and that 
obese participants had a similar number of disease-free 
years compared with normal-weight participants.14 Such 
findings are in contrast to those of large collaborative 
observational and instrumental variable studies, which 
reported a steadily increased risk of cardiovascular disease 
incidence29 and all-cause and cause-specific mortality30 
above normal weight for height, suggesting that the 
apparently protective associations of overweight for healthy 
lifespan are driven by confounding or bias.
The current findings on obesity are biologically 
plausible. For example, high levels of free fatty acids, 
inflammatory cytokines, lipid intermediates, and insulin 
resistance with excess total and intra-abdominal adipose 
tissue are among the pathophysiological mechanisms31 
underlying increased type 2 diabetes risk among obese 
people.32 Obesity-related excess adipose tissue surrounding 
and compressing the kidney, along with overactivity of the 
sympathetic nervous system contribute to hypertension, 
which is an important pathophysiological mechanism 
underlying heart diseases, stroke, and chronic kidney 
diseases.32 High fasting insulin concentrations33,34 together 
with increased lipid concentrations and lipid signalling 
can fuel cancer pathogenesis, and a low-grade inflam-
matory response might accelerate cancer progression.35 
Obesity produces changes in immune function, which 
affect host defence and might also have implications for 
immune diseases such as asthma.36
The difference in the number of disease-free years 
between underweight and normal weight was small. 
Other studies have shown that underweight is strongly 
associated with poor health and lower survival,37 but in 
those reports the participants were not initially free of 
major non-communicable conditions, as was the case 
in our study. Thus, the proportion of participants 
underweight due to weight loss caused by underlying 
chronic disease is likely to be greater in those 
investigations than in our study. Furthermore, many of 
the studies included in the present consortium were 
occupational cohort studies, which include healthier 
people than the general population, further increasing 
the proportion of healthy underweight participants.
This study has several limitations. First, there was 
heterogeneity in some study-specific estimates, potentially 
attributable to differences in assessment methods, 
settings, and variable definitions. Second, we limited loss 
of disease-free years to the commonest major chronic 
diseases: type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke,

cancer, asthma, and COPD. These are prioritised targets 
for prevention of premature mortality, although some 
cancers and COPD are not causally related to adiposity. 
We excluded conditions considered as risk factors for 
major non-communicable diseases, such as hypertension 
and chronic kidney disease, and less fatal obesity-related 
disorders, 
such 
as 
musculoskeletal 
problems 
or 
obstructive sleep apnoea.38–41 Thus, the observed loss of 
disease-free years is attributable to specific major 
conditions and reflects excess risk in a group of people 
with obesity rather than a loss of disease-free years caused 
by obesity. Third, although ascertainment of major non-
communicable diseases using linkage to electronic health 
records is comprehensive in relation to cancer, stroke, 
and coronary heart disease (as defined by myocardial 
infarction and coronary death), records of type 2 diabetes, 
asthma, and COPD in hospital and death registries cover 
only severe cases as these chronic diseases are typically 
diagnosed and treated in primary care and do not require 
hospital admissions. As expected, the incidence of each 
chronic disease was higher in men than women. 
However, women were diagnosed on average at a younger 
age than men, a finding that might partially relate to sex 
differences in health-care seeking behaviours.42
Further limitations are crude measurements of physical 
activity and socioeconomic position and, in some cohort 
studies, the use of self-reported rather than measured 
height and weight to calculate BMI. BMI is only an 
indirect measure of total body fat,43 and our findings were 
based on a single assessment of BMI, although repeat 
measurement from childhood to adulthood could have 
more comprehensively captured any additional effects of 
childhood obesity on the associations between BMI and 
number of disease-free years in adulthood. These 
limitations are more likely to lead to an underestimation 
than overestimation of the association between obesity 
and disease-free years. Finally, we cannot rule out the 
possibility of some residual confounding and reverse 
causality, despite subgroup analyses and the exclusion of 
participants with extant disease at baseline.
Despite these drawbacks, our results provide consistent 
evidence of an association between obesity and loss of 
disease-free years that exists in men and women, 
irrespective of position in the social hierarchy and 
lifestyle factors, such as smoking or physical activity. 
These findings lend support to obesity prevention as an 
important strategy for the reduction of morbidity.
