CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
BACKGROUND: Although large randomized clinical trials have found that primary prevention use 
of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) improves survival in patients with cardiomyopathy 
and heart failure symptoms, patients who receive ICDs in practice are often older and have more 
comorbidities than patients who were enrolled in the clinical trials. In addition, there is a debate 
among clinicians on the usefulness of electrophysiological study for risk stratification of asymptomatic 
patients with Brugada syndrome.
AIM: Our analysis has 2 objectives. First, to evaluate whether ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) induced 
with programmed electrostimulation in asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome identify 
a higher risk group that may require additional testing or therapies. Second, to evaluate whether 
implantation of an ICD is associated with a clinical benefit in older patients and patients with 
comorbidities who would otherwise benefit on the basis of left ventricular ejection fraction and heart 
failure symptoms.
METHODS: Traditional statistical approaches were used to address 1) whether programmed ventricular 
stimulation identifies a higher-risk group in asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome and 2) 
whether ICD implantation for primary prevention is associated with improved outcomes in older 
patients (>75 years of age) and patients with significant comorbidities who would otherwise meet 
criteria for ICD implantation on the basis of symptoms or left ventricular function.
RESULTS: Evidence from 6 studies of 1138 asymptomatic patients were identified. Brugada syndrome 
with inducible VA on electrophysiological study was identified in 390 (34.3%) patients. To minimize 
patient overlap, the primary analysis used 5 of the 6 studies and found an odds ratio of 2.3 (95% CI: 
0.63–8.66; P=0.2) for major arrhythmic events (sustained VAs, sudden cardiac death, or appropriate 
ICD therapy) in asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome and inducible VA on electrophysiological 
study versus those without inducible VA.Ten studies were reviewed that evaluated ICD use in older 
patients and 4 studies that evaluated unique patient populations were identified. In our analysis, 
ICD implantation was associated with improved survival (overall hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence 
interval: 0.67–0.83; P<0.001). Ten studies were identified that evaluated ICD use in patients with 
various comorbidities including renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, 
heart disease, and others. A random effects model demonstrated that ICD use was associated with 
reduced all-cause mortality (overall hazard ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.65–0.79; P<0.0001), 
and a second “minimal overlap” analysis also found that ICD use was associated with reduced all-cause 
mortality (overall hazard ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.61–0.82; P<0.0001). In 5 studies that 
included data on renal dysfunction, ICD implantation was associated with reduced all-cause mortality 
(overall hazard ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.60–0.85; P<0.001).

PREAMBLE
Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 
and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated 
scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with 
recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. 
These guidelines, based on systematic methods to 
evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone of 
quality cardiovascular care. In response to reports from 
the Institute of Medicine1,2 and a mandate to evaluate 
new knowledge and maintain relevance at the point 
of care, the ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice 
Guidelines (Task Force) modified its methodology.3–5
Evidence Review
The Task Force recognizes the need for objective, 
independent evidence review committees (ERCs) 
that include methodologists, epidemiologists, clini-
cians, and biostatisticians who systematically survey, 
abstract, and assess the evidence to address sys-
tematic review questions posed in the PICOTS for-
mat (P=population, I=intervention, C=comparator, 
O=outcome, T=timing, S=setting).2,4–6 Practical con-
siderations, including time and resource constraints, 
limit the ERCs to evidence that is relevant to key clini-
cal questions and lends itself to systematic review and 
analysis that could affect the strength of corresponding 
recommendations. Recommendations developed by 
the writing committee on the basis of the systematic 
review are marked “SR.”
Relationships With Industry and Other 
Entities
The ACC and AHA sponsor the guidelines without com-
mercial support, and members volunteer their time. The 
Task Force avoids actual, potential, or perceived con-
flicts of interest that might arise through relationships 
with industry or other entities (RWI). All ERC members 
are required to disclose current industry relationships 
or personal interests, from 12 months before initiation 
of the writing effort. The ERC chair and all ERC mem-
bers may not have any relevant RWI (Appendix 1). For 
transparency, ERC members’ comprehensive disclosure 
information is available online, as is comprehensive 
disclosure information for the Task Force.

Introduction: Part 1
Brugada syndrome was first described in 1992 after 
the identification of a cohort of patients with recur-
rent episodes of sudden cardiac death (SCD) with 
characteristic electrocardiographic features including 
a right bundle-branch block and persistent ST eleva-
tion in leads V1 to V2–V3.7 Since this finding, diagnostic 
criteria for Brugada syndrome have been established.8

it has been suggested that electrophysiological study 
with programmed ventricular stimulation may be used 
to assess inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias (VA).9 
The potential use of electrophysiological study for risk 
stratification has been of interest for asymptomatic 
patients with typical electrocardiographic features but 
without documented arrhythmias or syncope. Early 
studies have suggested that electrophysiological study 
is useful in identifying those at risk for VA. However, 
more recent studies have suggested that there is lim-
ited value to performing an electrophysiological study 
in asymptomatic patients.9–16 The implication is that 
for those patients with higher risk, an implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) would be suggested; 
however, ICD implantation is associated with proce-
dural complications, post-procedural complications, 
and problems such as inappropriate therapy.17 The in-
dication for performing electrophysiological study in 
asymptomatic patients a priori remains controversial.18 
The objective of this study is to ascertain the prognos-
tic value of electrophysiological study in asymptomatic 
patients with Brugada syndrome.
Methods: Part 1
A literature search of MEDLINE (via PubMed/OVID) and 
EMBASE (via OVID) was performed, with limits includ-
ing publication dates from 1966 to 2016, English lan-
guage, and human subjects, by Doctor Evidence, LLC 
(Santa Monica, CA). Study selection included these cri-
teria: Asymptomatic patients with a diagnosis of Bru-
gada syndrome who underwent electrophysiological 
study were included. All the studies based the diagnosis 
of Brugada Syndrome by electrocardiographic criteria 
and absence of structural heart disease. Patients de-
fined as symptomatic, patients with syncope, patients 
who experienced SCD, patients with sustained VA, and 
patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were ex-
cluded. Patients with inducible VA on electrophysiologi-
cal study were compared with those without inducible 
VA. The primary outcome was any major arrhythmic 
event (includes documented VA, SCD, and appropriate 
ICD therapy). Secondary outcomes included specifically 
appropriate shocks and SCD. Patients with <3 months 
of follow-up were excluded. Studies included were pro-
spective and retrospective observational studies, case 
series, randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), and 
systematic reviews/meta-analyses. Case reports were 
excluded. Initial screening for meeting inclusion criteria 
was performed by Doctor Evidence. Manuscripts were 
then screened by 2 independent adjudicators to deter-
mine relevancy, and mutually agreed on studies were 
included for meta-analysis.
Meta-analysis was performed using the DOC Data 
2.0 advanced web-based platform (Doctor Evidence: 
DOC Data, Version 2.0, Santa Monica, CA). All studies 
were summarized by raw rates (number of events and 
denominators). The primary analysis was performed us-
ing the Random Effect model, with 0.1 continuity cor-
rection. The Mantel-Haenszel and PETO methods were 
also used.
Results: Part 1
The literature search identified 236 titles and abstracts 
through MEDLINE/EMBASE database, using various 
combinations of identifiers for Brugada syndrome, 
right bundle-branch block, ST-segment, sudden death, 
electrophysiology, programmed ventricular stimulation, 
SCD, sustained VA, and ICD therapy. Seventy-two stud-
ies were selected for full-text analysis, of which another 
66 were excluded (1 population not of interest; 1 inter-
vention not of interest; 19 looking at other parameters 
on electrophysiological studies; 1 nonclinical study; 10 
inadequate number of participants; 8 publications with 
shared data; and 25 outcome stratification not of inter-
est) and 1 was exchanged for a more recent update 
on the patient population14,19 (Figure 1.1 for details of 
selection). In the end, 6 studies were selected for the 
meta-analysis.10–14,16 To avoid potential duplication of 
data, we excluded 1 study10 because part of this study’s 
population was also included in a subsequent retrospec-
tive analysis15 that is included in our analysis. However, 
because an unspecified proportion of their study popu-
lation was not included in subsequent studies, a second 
meta-analysis including this study was also performed.
In the final 6 studies used for the analysis,10–14,16 
there were 1138 asymptomatic patients with Brugada 
syndrome, with inducible VA on electrophysiological 
study in 390 (34.3%) patients (Data Supplement 1). 
Of the patients with inducible VA, 13 total arrhythmic 
events occurred (3.3% of the patients with inducible 
VA). In asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome, 
748 patients did not have inducible VA on electrophysi-
ological study. There were 12 total arrhythmic events in 
this population (1.6% of the patients with noninducible 
VA). This results in an odds ratio (OR) of 2.3 (95% con-
fidence interval [CI]: 0.63 to 8.66; P=0.20) for major ar-
rhythmic events in asymptomatic patients with Bruga-
da syndrome and inducible VA on electrophysiological 
study (Figure 1.2). Due to the small number of events, 
specific analyses of secondary outcomes could not be 
performed.
Including the original registry study of Brugada 
syndrome from 2003,10 which may introduce duplica-
tion of patients, there were a total of 1401 patients 
of whom 481 had inducible VA on electrophysiological 
study (34.3%). In this cohort, there were 24 arrhythmic 
events in the patients with inducible VA (5.0%). Among 
patients with noninducible VA, there were 14 arrhyth-
mic events (1.5%). This results in an OR of 3.3 (95% 
CI: 1.03 to 10.4; P=0.04) for major arrhythmic events

in asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome and 
inducible VA on electrophysiological study (Figure 1.3).
Two studies20,21 were examined that specifically 
looked at long-term results in patients who underwent 
ICD implantation. A multicenter study21 followed 166 
asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome for 
85±36 months after ICD implantation. They reported 
7% appropriate ICD shocks and 28% inappropriate 
shocks, and 1 death related to inappropriate shock–in-
duced ventricular fibrillation. A recent analysis from an-
other registry20 described 13% appropriate shocks and 
15% inappropriate shocks among 46 asymptomatic 
patients with Brugada syndrome over a 20-year period.
Discussion: Part 1
The role of inducibility of VA in electrophysiological 
study for risk stratification of asymptomatic Brugada 
syndrome has been a source of great debate.8,22 A large 
observational study10 had shown an extremely high in-
cidence of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (28%) 
in patients with inducible VA on electrophysiological 
study, as opposed to only 2% in patients with nonin-
ducible VA. Similarly, in a 20-year experience of patients 
with Brugada syndrome, inducibility of VA on elec-
trophysiological study in asymptomatic patients had 
75.0% sensitivity, 91.3% specificity, positive predictive 
value 18.2%, and negative predictive value 98.3% for 
spontaneous VA or ICD shocks.23 However, this study 
included 137 patients that had been included in earlier 
Brugada syndrome registries.
Interestingly, the overall inducibility rate (symptom-
atic and asymptomatic patients) decreased from 49% 
to 18%, which also reflects the findings of a similar 
cohort.10,23 Among asymptomatic patients in that co-
hort, the rates decreased from 34.6% to 10%.10,15 
Similarly, the annual event rate for VA or ICD shock de-
creased from 4.5% to 0.9%. These studies suggest that 
these findings might be related to an earlier selection 
bias as initial reports included patients at higher risk. 
These findings still differ widely from the PRELUDE (Pro-
grammed Electrical Stimulation Predictive Value)12 and 
the FINGER (France, Italy, Germany)14 registries of Bruga-
da syndrome patients. In the PRELUDE registry,12 which 
included 273 asymptomatic patients, there was no sig-
nificant difference in event rates between patients with 
inducible and noninducible VA. The more recent and 
larger FINGER registry14 of 654 asymptomatic patients 
found a higher event rate in the patients with inducible 
VA (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), which was 
nonsignificant on multivariable analysis, with an overall 
low incidence of 0.5% in asymptomatic patients. Both 
the PRELUDE and FINGER registries had shorter median 
follow-up duration.15 The 3 other studies included in 
our meta-analysis,11,13,16 also showed no difference in 
event rates between asymptomatic patients with induc-
ible and noninducible VA, with an extremely low overall 
event rate.
There was a wide range of inducibility of VA on elec-
trophysiological study as outlined in Table 1. This may 
have been secondary to the patient population or the 
differences in the technical aspects of the ventricular 
stimulation protocol, also outlined in Table 1. Although 
some have suggested that a less aggressive ventricu-
lar stimulation strategy limited to the right ventricular 
apex might improve the specificity of electrophysiologi-
cal study in prognostication of asymptomatic Brugada 
syndrome, this hypothesis remains untested.23 A study 
assessing the impact of a number of extrastimuli in 
electrophysiological study24 suggested that a less ag-
gressive protocol limited to single or double extrastimuli 
resulted in a better positive predictive value and nega-
tive predictive value compared with triple extrastimulus 
testing (<3 extrastimuli: positive predictive value: 36%; 
negative predictive value: 87% versus 3 extra-stimuli: 
positive predictive value: 23%; negative predictive val-
ue: 81%). However, VA induction specifically from the 
right ventricular apex was not predictive of subsequent 
cardiac events.
The relatively high incidence of inappropriate ICD 
shocks in patients with Brugada syndrome20,21 could be 
related to the relatively younger age of this population 
or programming strategies. One study demonstrated 
that the combination of R-wave amplitude >5 mV at 
implantation, optimal programming (long interval to 
detection duration, single high ventricular fibrillation 
zone >210 to 220 bpm), and close follow-up with re-
mote monitoring was associated with lower rate of in-
appropriate shocks (0.7%/year compared with 3.7%/
year in the general Brugada syndrome population).21
Our meta-analysis shows that for the outcome vari-
ables of VA and appropriate ICD shocks, there was no 
significant difference between asymptomatic patients 
with Brugada syndrome with or without inducible VA 
on electrophysiological study. However, inclusion of the 
additional study,10 potentially leading to double count-
ing patients, led to a modestly significant increased OR 
for arrhythmia in this population (P=0.044). In observing 
the Forest plot, the concern of patient overlap between 
the 2 studies10,15 is quite evident. Only these 2 studies 
show positive significance for the inducible group with 
OR above unity. To evaluate whether there may have 
been a link between study size and treatment effect 
and to screen for any reporting bias, Funnel plots were 
performed and are shown in Figure 1.4 and Figure 1.5, 
both with and without inclusion of the additional study 
that could lead to potential double counting.
To summarize, our meta-analysis of relevant stud-
ies for the role of electrophysiological study in asymp-
tomatic patients with Brugada syndrome suggests that 
inducibility of VA in asymptomatic patients does not 
predict higher VA or ICD shocks. In fact, the extremely

low overall event rate in the asymptomatic population 
in almost all studies suggests that this population is at 
low risk for future cardiac events.
Limitations: Part 1
This meta-analysis is limited by a small number of 
events. This precludes subanalyses within the asymp-
tomatic Brugada population, including patients with 
spontaneous type I patterns or other electrocardio-
graphic patterns and those with family history of ar-
rhythmic events. Although every effort was made to 
avoid duplication of populations, this remains a po-
tential confounder, especially when adding the 2003 
study.10 The exact protocol for electrophysiological 
study could also not be evaluated given the small 
numbers and nature of reporting in the studies as this 
may influence inducibility.

PART 2: WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF 
ICD IMPLANTATION FOR PRIMARY 
PREVENTION IN OLDER PATIENTS 
AND PATIENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT 
COMORBIDITIES?
Introduction: Part 2
Several RCTs have clearly established the mortality 
benefit of ICDs placed for primary prevention.25–27 In 
general, candidates for ICD implantation for primary 
prevention of SCD are patients with heart failure (HF) 
and a left ventricular ejection fraction <30% to 40% 
as long as optimal medical therapy and a reasonable 
expectation of meaningful survival (>1 year) are pres-
ent.25–30 In this cohort including patients with ischemic 
and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, the reduction in 
mortality from the ICD ranges from 23% to 55%.31,32 
Similar benefit has also been described for subcutane-
ous ICD.33,34 As such, with expanding indications and 
technological advances, the rate of implantation of the 
devices continues to rise.32,35
However, there are a number of RCTs demonstrat-
ing that certain subgroups do not clearly benefit from 
primary prevention ICD implantation. Patients with a 
recent myocardial infarction (within the past 40 days) 
and patients with revascularization by coronary artery 
bypass grafting36,37 show no survival advantage with an 
ICD in place. Furthermore, a number of patient popula-
tions were not well studied in many of the landmark 
ICD RCTs and it is uncertain whether these subgroups 
also benefit from ICD implantation.31,32
Patients enrolled in many of the landmark RCTs may 
not be representative of patients who are evaluated 
and referred for ICD implantation in real-world prac-
tice. For example, the mean or median age of patients 
enrolled in pivotal trials ranged between 58 and 67 
years (MUSTT [Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia 
Trial],28 MADIT-I [Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator 
Implantation Trial I],26 MADIT-II [Multicenter Automatic 
Defibrillator Implantation Trial II],27 SCD-HeFT [Sudden 
Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial],25 CABG-PATCH 
[Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patch] Trial,36 DEFINITE

of the patients in MUSTT, MADIT-I, MADIT-II, and SCD-
HeFT.38 By contrast, a recent analysis of the National 
Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) ICD Registry 
showed a large number of patients >70 years of age.39 
In addition to older age, these patients often have co-
morbidities such as renal disease, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), and frailty. Also in these 
patients, it is unclear if ICD therapy has any significant 
benefit for mortality.
Methods: Part 2
Selection and Characteristics of Studies
Screening was performed against the predefined PI-
COTS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, 
Timing, Setting) selection criteria using the Doctor Evi-
dence Library Management System.
A literature search of MEDLINE (through PubMed/ 
OVID), EMBASE (via OVID), and Cochrane Central Data-
base of Controlled Trials (via CENTRAL) was performed 
with limits including publication dates from 1996 to 
2016, English language, and human subjects.
Studies were included if they met these eligibility 
criteria: adults ≥18 years of age, left ventricular sys-
tolic dysfunction ≤40% with or without defined HF, 
renal failure, frailty (defined by Charlson Comorbid-
ity Index40 or Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices,41 and 
pulmonary disease/smoking. Exclusion criteria were 
those patients with any of these: syncope, prior SCD, 
sustained VAs, and/or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
The intervention of interest was implantation of a 
transvenous or subcutaneous ICD with no cardiac 
resynchronization therapy (CRT). Those studies with 
CRT implants were excluded (to eliminate any poten-
tial effect from CRT on outcomes) as were studies 
evaluating ICDs placed for secondary prevention. The 
primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes 
included SCD, and complications and adverse events 
from the intervention including periprocedural is-
sues, inappropriate tachyarrhythmic therapy, hospi-
talizations, and post-procedure device complications. 
Studies with <3 months of follow-up were excluded. 
Studies included were RCTs, prospective and retro-
spective observational cohort studies with concurrent 
controls that report outcomes of interest in a multi-
variate model, nonrandomized controlled trials with 
concurrent controls that report outcomes of inter-
est in a multivariate model, case series, uncontrolled 
observational studies, and systematic reviews/meta-
analyses. Case reports and conference abstracts were 
excluded. Unpublished studies and abstracts were 
not sought.
The Doctor Evidence Library Management System is 
a web-based software platform featuring key word em-
phasis (coloring or bolding of key words), search, and 
ranking functionalities as well as ability to assign and 
manage reasons rejected for all references at all stag-
es of screening. Studies that met the inclusion criteria 
based on the population, intervention, and study de-
sign reported in the article’s title/abstract were included 
for full-text review. Articles title/abstract screening was 
performed by a single reviewer with subsequent quality 
control by an independent reviewer. All quality control 
was performed using the tools and functions available 
in the library management system. The references of 
individual studies were also back-checked for relevant 
studies.
Members of the ERC were divided into pairs and 
performed dual independent review of full-text articles 
in the DOC Library software platform. Disagreements 
were resolved through discussion between the 2 re-
viewers and then by the ERC chair.
After a comprehensive screening process, 18 stud-
ies that met the criteria were identified.29,42–58 All 
studies addressed the question of whether there is 
a survival benefit from prophylactic ICD implantation 
compared with no-device therapy in 3 specific groups: 
1) older (≥75 years of age) patients, 2) patients with 
coexistent significant comorbidities, and 3) patients 
with renal dysfunction. Eight studies29,43,45,47,51,52,55,56 
used patient level data from ≥1 published RCTs. Three 
studies49,50,54 were single-center retrospective obser-
vational studies. Six studies42,44,48,53,57,58 were retro-
spective cohort studies in which patients were drawn 
mainly from 2 major national registries: 1) the NCDR 
ICD Registry of the American College of Cardiology 
Foundation and the Heart Rhythm Society; and 2) the 
Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) 
database derived from OPTIMIZE-HF (Organized Pro-
gram to Initiate Life-saving Treatment in Hospitalized 
Patients With Heart Failure) study. Two studies derived 
their patient cohorts from existing institutional (single 
or multicenter) registries.46,50 Given that multiple stud-
ies have drawn patients from common registries, we 
recognized the potential for patients being included 
in >1 study. The characteristics of the studies, com-
parators, outcomes and adjustments are summarized 
in Data Supplement 2.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Quality assessment was performed on the included 
studies. All studies showed intermediate-to-high per-
tinence regarding their study population, intervention, 
and outcome measures. Studies that were performed 
on patient level data from RCTs had low risk of bias 
since they administered independent and blind assess-
ment of outcomes. Studies of retrospective design had 
intermediate overall risk of bias due to the lack of im-
plementation of blind assessment of outcomes.
Data extraction and meta-analyses were performed 
with the DOC Data 2.0 software platform using a uni-
versal electronic extraction form and guided by a data

configuration protocol that specifies the characteris-
tics and outcomes and associated metadata (variables 
that characterize numerical data points) to extract. 
Data points and metadata were extracted from the 
articles and input manually into the database, and 
with automated quality control features to prevent in-
correct data-type entry into incompatible fields. Each 
collected data point was verified manually against the 
source article by an independent reviewer (ie, single 
extraction with sequential quality control). Using an 
ontology management tool within the platform, the 
naming of outcomes of similar type—based on the 
author-reported outcome name as well as author-
reported definitions—was managed for consistency. 
Statistical tests for heterogeneity suggested low-to-
moderate heterogeneity (I2: 0% to 27%), and funnel 
plots did not provide convincing evidence for the pres-
ence of publication bias.
The final search plan and workflow of inclusion of 
studies is described in PRISMA Figures 2.1 and 2.2.

ICD Implantation in Older Patients
Description of Individual Studies
A 2007 study47 examined a subgroup of previously 
published RCT patients (n=204) who were ≥75 years of 
age. The mean age of this subgroup was 79±3 years, 
and 128 of them were randomized to undergo ICD im-
plant surgery. The HR for the mortality risk in patients 
assigned to ICD therapy compared with those assigned 
to conventional therapy was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.29 to 
1.08; P=0.08) after a mean follow-up of 17.2 months.
A pooled analysis of 5 previously published RCTs 
(MADIT-I, MUSTT, MADIT-II, DEFINITE, and SCD-HeFT) 
examined the relationship of patient’s age on the risks 
of death and rehospitalization after primary prevention 
ICD implantation.45 In the 390 patients (58% of whom 
were randomized to receive an ICD) who were ≥75 
years of age, the HR for risk of mortality (ICD versus 
non-ICD recipients) was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.37 to 0.78) 
after a median follow-up duration of 2.6 years.
The DEFINITE study29 examined the benefit of pro-
phylactic ICD to prevent SCD in patients with non-isch-
emic cardiomyopathy by randomizing 458 patients to 
receive standard medical therapy or standard medical 
therapy plus single-chamber ICD and following these 
patients for a mean duration of 29 months. Among the 
subgroup of patients (n=157) who were ≥65 years of 
age, the HR for risk of mortality was approximately 0.61 
(95% CI: 0.32 to 1.18).
In a retrospective single-center analysis,49 99 patients 
≥80 years of age who received a primary prevention 
ICD were compared with a cohort of similar patients 
≥80 years of age who did not receive an ICD (n=53). 
During the mean follow-up period of 2.3±2.0 years, the 
adjusted HR for risk of mortality (ICD versus non-ICD) 
was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.44 to 1.30; P=0.312). In this study, 
only age (P=0.043) and glomerular filtration rate59 
(P=0.006) predicted survival.
In an analysis of the GWTG-HF registry linked with 
data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Ser-
vices, 430 women with HF (median age, 76 years) who 
received a primary prevention ICD were propensity 
score matched to 430 women (median age, 76 years) 
who did not.58
Median follow-up period was 3.4 years versus 3.0 
years, respectively. After adjusting for multiple co-
variates, the risk of mortality in women with an ICD 
compared with those without an ICD was significantly 
lower (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.90; P=0.002). In a 
parallel comparison, 859 men (median age, 75 years) 
who received a primary prevention ICD were propen-
sity score matched to 859 men (median age, 75 years) 
who did not receive an ICD. Median follow-up period 
was 3.9 years versus 2.9 years, respectively. After ad-
justing for multiple covariates, the risk of mortality in 
men with an ICD compared with those without an ICD 
was also significantly lower (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.67 to 
0.87; P<0.001).
In a large multiple registry–based study, 1487 pa-
tients (mean age, 75 years) admitted with HF who 
received a primary prevention ICD (from NCDR ICD 
Registry) were matched in 1:1 manner to 1487 pa-
tients (mean age, 75 years) who did not receive an ICD 
(from GWTG-HF registry linked with Medicare claims) 
and studied with a median follow-up period of 4.5 
years.48 The 3-year adjusted mortality rate was lower 
in the ICD group versus the non-ICD group (46.7% 
versus 55.8%; adjusted HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.69 to 
0.83; P<0.0001).
In a study from the NCDR ICD Registry,42 408 patients 
(median age, 76 years) with left ventricular ejection 
fraction 30% to 35% who received a primary preven-
tion ICD were propensity score matched and compared 
with 408 similar patients (median age, 75 years) from 
the GWTG-HF database who did not receive an ICD. 
Median follow-up period was 4.4 years. The 3-year ad-
justed mortality rate was lower in the ICD group versus 
the non-ICD group (47.1% versus 58.0%; adjusted HR: 
0.83; 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.99; P=0.04).
In another study from the NCDR ICD Registry,51 179 
patients from the NCDR ICD Registry who were ethnic 
minorities (nonwhite race or Hispanic) were propensity 
score matched and compared with 121 similar patients 
from the GWTG-HF database who did not receive an 
ICD. Median follow-up period was 3.1 years. The 3-year 
adjusted mortality rate was lower in the ICD group ver-
sus the non-ICD group (adjusted HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63 
to 0.98; P=0.034). In the same study, 490 white, non-
Hispanic patients with prophylactic ICD were propensity

score matched and compared with 303 similar patients 
without an ICD. The 3-year adjusted mortality rate was 
lower in the ICD group versus the non-ICD group (ad-
justed HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.83; P<0.0001).
In a study from the merged registries of OPTIMIZE-
HF and GWTG-HF, 188 patients (75 to 84 years of age) 
with ICDs were compared with 2458 similar patients 
without an ICD from the same registries.44 During the 
follow-up period of 3 years, the inverse probability-
weighted adjusted HR for mortality was 0.80 (95% CI: 
0.62 to 1.03; P=not reported).
In a study from the NCDR ICD Registry, 490 women 
 
(≥65 years of age) who received an ICD during a hos-
pitalization for HF from January 1, 2006, through 
 
December 31, 2007, were propensity score matched to 
490 ICD-eligible women without an ICD hospitalized 
for HF in the GWTG-HF database from January 1, 2006, 
through December 31, 2009.57 After a median follow-up 
of 4.6 years versus 3.2 years (ICD versus non-ICD), the 
survival of women with an ICD was significantly longer 
than that of women without an ICD (adjusted HR: 0.79; 
95% CI: 0.66 to 0.95; P=0.013). In a parallel comparison 
from the same study, men (≥65 years of age) with an ICD 
had lower mortality than men without an ICD (adjusted 
HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.83; P<0.0001).
Collective Data Analysis
An initial analysis of all the studies29,42,44,45,47–49,51,57,58 de-
scribed is shown in Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4. Given that 
several articles used patients from common registries, 
some patients were included in >1 study. To eliminate 
patient duplication, a “minimal overlap” meta-analysis 
was performed using 4 of the studies44,45,48,49 that in-
cluded patients from 4 exclusively different databases. 
A survival advantage of ICD versus no ICD was seen with 
an overall HR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.83; P<0.001) 
(Figure 2.5). The studies reported data using different 
age ranges. In an attempt to best answer the systematic 
review question, age ranges of 70 to 84 years,48 75 to 
84 years,44 79 to 90 years,49 and ≥75 years45 were used. 
Out of the included registries only SCD-HeFT25 had pa-
tients >80 years of age. To examine whether there may 
have been a link between study size and treatment ef-
fect and to screen for any reporting bias, a Funnel plot 
was performed and is shown in Figure 2.6.
ICD Implantation in Patients With Significant 
Comorbidities
Description of Individual Studies
A post hoc analysis of MADIT-II56 examined the interac-
tion between ICD therapy and diabetes mellitus. The 
HR for the risk of death in patients treated with ICD 
compared with those treated with conventional therapy 
was similar in patients with diabetes mellitus (HR: 0.61; 
95% CI: 0.38 to 0.98) as in patients without diabetes 
mellitus (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.05).
A retrospective, single-center study54 evaluated po-
tential survival benefit of ICD in patients with COPD. In 
a pool of 100 patients with a COPD diagnosis (30 with 
and 70 without ICD), it was found that the patients 
with an ICD had lower total corrected mortality rate 
compared with those without an ICD (2-year survival 
of 88% vs. 59%; P=0.016). In a multivariate model us-
ing the propensity score, the ICD was protective against 
death (HR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.59; P=0.004).
A retrospective, single-center study49 that sought 
to examine whether octogenarians and nonagenar-
ians derive a survival benefit from ICDs implanted in 
the primary prevention setting also performed another 
analysis that focused on comorbidities using the Charl-
son Comorbidity Index. During the follow-up period of 
2.3±2.0 years, 93 patients died (58 in the ICD group 
and 35 in the non-ICD group). ICD recipients had better 
1-year survival compared with those with no ICD (72% 
versus 52%; P=0.014). However, after the adjustment 
for other comorbid factors, such as left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), age, and 
Charlson Comorbidity Index, ICD implantation did not 
confer survival benefit (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.45 to 1.34; 
P=0.312) in a multivariate model for which only age 
and GFR were independently associated with survival.
Four RCTs (MADIT-I, MADIT-II, DEFINITE and SCD-
HeFT)25–27,29 have been analyzed together using patient-
level data with a focus on the effect of comorbidities.55 
A total of 3348 patients were assessed with respect to 
these comorbidities: smoking, pulmonary disease, dia-
betes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrilla-
tion, ischemic heart disease, and chronic kidney disease 
(CKD); 75% of the patients had ≥2 comorbidities. The 
unadjusted HR for death in patients with an ICD versus 
without ICD was significantly lower. However, this ef-
fect was attenuated in patients with ≥2 comorbidities 
(unadjusted HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.84) compared 
with those with <2 comorbidities (unadjusted HR: 0.59; 
95% CI: 0.40 to 0.87). After adjustment, the survival 
benefit of an ICD decreased with increasing number of 
comorbidities (P=0.004).
An analysis of the NCDRs ICD Registry and the 
GWTG-HF registry linked with Medicare claims evalu-
ated the modulating effect of comorbidities on ICD 
implant.48 They examined the survival outcomes associ-
ated with primary prevention ICD compared with no 
ICD among patients with HF, and found that ICD im-
plantation was associated with better survival both in 
patients with ≤3 comorbidities (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.69 
to 0.87) and in those with >3 comorbidities (HR: 0.77; 
95% CI: 0.64 to 0.93).
A post hoc analysis of MADIT-II27 evaluated the sur-
vival outcome of patients with an ICD implant and cor-
related with the degree of renal dysfunction as quanti-
tated by estimated GFR (eGFR).43 Multivariate analysis 
in patients treated conventionally (ie, without an ICD)

showed that for each 10-unit reduction in eGFR, the 
risk of all-cause mortality increased by 16% (P=0.005). 
In comparison, ICD therapy was associated with a sur-
vival benefit in each eGFR category of >35 mL/ min/1.73 
m2 (overall risk reduction for all-cause mortality 32%; 
P=0.001). This beneficial effect was lost for an eGFR <35 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (all-cause mortality HR: 1.09; P=0.84).
Cumulative data on patients who were enrolled in 
2 registries and had history of end-stage renal disease, 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and ICD implanta-
tion have been analyzed in a retrospective study.46 The 
median survival durations in the ICD group versus non-
ICD group were 8.0 years and 3.1 years, respectively. The 
multivariate analysis showed that the ICD group had sig-
nificantly less all-cause mortality compared with the non-
ICD group (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.82; P=0.013).
A meta-analysis of 3 large RCTs (MADIT-I, MADIT-II, and 
SCD-HeFT)25–27 evaluated 2867 patients of whom 36.3% 
had eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2.52 The probability of death 
during the follow-up period was 43.3% for 1334 pa-
tients assigned to receive the usual care versus 35.8% for 
1533 patients who were assigned to the ICD group. After 
adjustment for baseline differences, there was evidence 
that the survival benefit associated with ICDs compared 
with usual care was dependent on eGFR. ICD was associ-
ated with survival benefit for patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/ 
min/1.73 m2 (adjusted HR: 0.49), but not for patients 
with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (adjusted HR: 0.80).
A retrospective study53 identified 108 patients on di-
alysis who received a primary prevention ICD from the 
NCDR ICD Registry and compared them with a similar 
set of 195 patients drawn from the GWTG-HF registry 
without an ICD. Using the propensity score technique, 
they matched the ICD recipients to non-ICD patients, 
and the overall survival was compared between the 
2 groups. Three-year mortality was 68.8% in the ICD 
cohort compared with 75.7% in the non-ICD cohort. 
There was no significant survival advantage associated 
with an ICD (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.66 to 1.13; P=0.29). 
After propensity score matching, the analysis included 
86 ICD patients and 86 controls. The 3-year mortality 
was 74.0% in the ICD group and 76.6% in the control 
group (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.31, P=0.71).
A single-center registry of patients with CKD has 
been studied to examine the benefit of ICDs placed for 
primary prevention.50 A total of 1053 patients with an 
ICD were matched to 631 control patients without an 
ICD. During the median follow-up of 2.9 years, the HR 
of death among propensity score matched patients was 
0.69 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.82) for the ICD group com-
pared with the non-ICD group. A statistically significant 
interaction was found between ICDs and eGFR (P=0.04).
Specifically, ICD was associated with a lower risk 
of death among those with eGFR of 45 to 59 mL/

CI: 0.50 to 0.85), but not among those with eGFR <30

Collective Data Analysis
The first meta-analysis included all 10 studies43,46,48–50,52–56 
to determine whether ICDs implanted for primary pre-
vention is associated with improved survival in patients 
with significant comorbidities. Comorbid conditions 
were defined as various combinations of renal disease, 
COPD, atrial fibrillation, heart disease, and others. Ran-
dom effects model demonstrated that all-cause mortal-
ity was improved with ICD implantation compared with 
without ICD implantation (overall HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 
0.65 to 0.79; P<0.0001) (Figure 2.7). A second “mini-
mal overlap” meta-analysis was performed using only 5 
of the studies46,50,52,53,55 so that the potential for patient 
duplication across multiple studies could be minimized. 
Random effects model found that all-cause mortality 
was improved with ICD implantation compared with 
without ICD implantation (overall HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 
0.61 to 0.82; P<0.0001) (Figure 2.8). To examine wheth-
er there may have been a link between study size and 
treatment effect and to screen for any reporting bias, 
Funnel plots were performed (Figures 2.9 and 2.10).
ICD Implantation in Patients With Renal Disease
Five of these 10 comorbidity studies43,46,50,52,53 included 
data specifically on patients with varying degree of renal 
dysfunction. We conducted a meta-analysis using these 
5 studies43,46,50,52,53 to assess whether there is an overall 
mortality benefit with the implantation of primary pre-
vention ICD in patients with renal disease. Random ef-
fects model demonstrated that all-cause mortality was 
improved with ICD implantation compared with with-
out ICD implantation (overall HR: 0.71; 95% CI 0.60 
to 0.85; P<0.001) (Figure 2.11). To examine whether 
there may have been a link between study size and 
treatment effect and to screen for any reporting bias, a 
Funnel plot was performed (Figure 2.12). The definition 
of renal disease varied dramatically among the 5 studies 
with only 2 studies46,53 specifically studying ICD implant 
in patients with end-stage renal disease.
Discussion: Part 2
Although numerous studies have resulted in demon-
strating the survival benefits of ICDs for primary preven-
tion of SCD, certain groups of patients have unclear ben-
efit. The life expectancy, at any given age, is not <1 year 
until a person reaches 113 years of age (https://www.
ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html).60 However, with the 
presence of a depressed ejection fraction among other 
conditions, there are attenuating circumstances on ex-
pected survival for most patients being considered for 
an ICD. As such, 2 main groups of patients, older pa-
tients and those patients with significant comorbidities, 
such as renal dysfunction, COPD, or diabetes mellitus,

may not benefit from ICD implantation and are the fo-
cus of this review. The analyses performed in this review 
sought to determine whether there is a survival benefit 
associated with primary prevention ICD implantation 
compared with no-device therapy in those patients who 
are older age and those with significant comorbidities.
In this meta-analysis, in older patients (≥75 years of 
age), primary prevention ICD implantation is associated 
with benefit, with an HR reduction of 24% for death 
compared with those patients without ICD implanta-
tion. However, the data are derived from retrospective 
observational studies and significant uncertainty still re-
mains on the potential benefit of ICD implant in older 
patients. Age itself remains a predictor of mortality with 
higher mortality rates occurring in these older patients 
than seen in the landmark clinical trials.61,62 However, 
the HR reduction in death from ICD implantation in 
older individuals appears consistent with the reduction 
seen in younger persons. These individual studies that 
do not show survival benefit in older patients are likely 
under-powered.29,44,47,49
Even with the presence of comorbidities, an ICD im-
plant is associated with benefit in these older patients. 
Looking at patients with ≤3 comorbidities (chronic lung 
disease, prior atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, 
diabetes mellitus, and renal disease) versus >3 comor-
bidities, ICDs are associated with improved survival in 
both groups with HR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.69 to 0.87) 
and HR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.64 to 0.93), respectively.48
Prior studies also suggest that the benefit of ICD im-
plantation increases as the ejection fraction decreases 
below 35%.63 Thus, if the patients’ ejection fraction 
was closer to 35%, these older patients may derive less 
or no benefit. However, using the NCDR ICD Registry 
with similar patients from the GWTG-HF database, sur-
vival in patients who had an ejection fraction of 30% to 
35% was improved with an HR of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.69 
to 0.99; P=0.04). Those older patients with ejection 
fraction <30% had a larger mortality reduction with an 
HR of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.81; P<0.001).42
The applicability of these primary prevention ICDs to 
underrepresented groups, such as women and minori-
ties, also remains largely unknown. Most of the clinical 
trials are comprised of men as the majority of the study 
population, with women comprising only 8% to 29% 
of the cohorts (MUSTT, MADIT-I, MADIT-II, SCD-HeFT, 
CABG-PATCH, DEFINITE, DINAMIT, IRIS).25–30,36,37 Minori-
ties accounted for a similarly low percentage as noted 
in MUSTT and SCD-HeFT.25,28 From the NCDR ICD Reg-
istry and GWTG-HF registry, there are suggestions that 
older women still benefit from ICD implantation. Data 
analysis from those registries showed that older women 
with an ICD had a lower mortality rate at 1- and 3-year 
follow-up, with adjusted HR of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66 to 
0.95) compared with those without primary prevention 
ICD.57 In another analysis of the same registries, minori-
ties (Hispanic, Black, Asian, American Indian, Alaska 
Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander) also had 
lower overall mortality with an adjusted HR of 0.79 
(95% CI: 0.63 to 0.98; P=0.034).51
Similar benefit is seen with primary prevention ICD 
implantation in patients with significant comorbidities. 
In the past, regarding clinically complex patients with 
multiple comorbidities, studies performed to determine 
the benefit of ICDs have been limited, inadequately 
powered, and largely observational.55 Additionally, 
some of these studies have looked at specific comorbid-
ities in isolation, as opposed to accounting for patients 
with several comorbidities that influence mortality, as is 
typically seen in day-to-day clinical practice.
In patients with CKD, the risks and benefits of primary 
prevention ICD therapy are unclear. Observational studies 
have described decreased overall survival and increased 
complication rates in patients with primary prevention 
ICDs and CKD compared with patients without CKD. 
However, the patients who have received ICDs have not 
consistently been compared with a control group with 
CKD that did not receive primary prevention ICD using 
a prospective randomized trial design.52 This has made it 
a challenge to determine whether these specific patients 
derive benefit from ICD therapy. Also, within this sub-
group of patients of CKD, the degree of renal insufficiency 
likely influences survival benefit, as indicated by some of 
the individual studies included in our meta-analysis.43,50,52
We conducted a meta-analysis that included all 10 
studies of patients with comorbidities, including renal 
disease.30,43,46,48–50,52–54,56 A separate specific analysis of 
the 5 studies16,43,46,50,52,53 that explored renal dysfunction 
was also done. In both cases, a random effects model 
demonstrated that all-cause mortality was improved 
compared with no ICD implantation. Six of the 10 studies 
were retrospective observational studies.46,48–50,52,53 The 4 
studies that incorporated data from 4 RCTs in total were 
MADIT-I, MADIT-II, DEFINITE, and SCD-HeFT.25–27,29 Most 
patients, ≈62% and ≈65% in the overall analysis and the 
renal disease analysis, respectively, were drawn from ob-
servational studies. There was significant overlap in the 
patient populations as the retrospective observational 
studies predominantly drew patients from the NDCR ICD 
Registry and the GWTG-HF registry. This was especially 
the case in the studies that used data from RCTs. For 
example, the 2 studies in the renal disease analysis that 
used patient level data from RCTs overlapped in their 
inclusion of patients from MADIT-II.27
Our analyses indicate that patients with comorbidi-
ties, including renal dysfunction, derive a survival benefit 
from primary prevention ICD implantation. In the model 
assessing all 10 studies of patients with comorbidities, 
the overall HR of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.79; P<0.001) 
(Figure 2.7). In the meta-analysis of patients with renal 
disease, there was evidence of an overall benefit to ICD 
implantation compared with no ICD therapy (HR: 0.71;

95% CI: 0.60 to 0.85; P<0.001) (Figure 2.11). However, 
it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the role of 
ICD in end-stage renal disease because these patients 
comprised a very small percentage of the total number 
of patients with CKD.
Among the studies that looked at patients with sig-
nificant comorbidities, patients had a range of comor-
bidities including atrial fibrillation, pulmonary disease, 
renal disease, ischemic heart disease, diabetes melli-
tus, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular 
disease. A single-center, retrospective49 study assessed 
comorbid conditions using the Charlson Comorbidity 
Index,40 which includes an even wider range of co-
morbidities in addition to the aforementioned medical 
conditions.
Prior landmark clinical trials have demonstrated the 
survival benefit of ICD therapy for primary prevention 
of SCD, although many of these patients were younger 
and had less comorbidity when compared with the typi-
cal patient encountered in clinical practice. The average 
age of the patients in our meta-analysis of significant 
comorbidities was generally older (Data Supplement 2) 
 
when compared with patients enrolled in the land-
mark clinical trials that were designed to evaluate ICD 
therapy for primary prevention of SCD.25–27 As such, our 
meta-analysis is more applicable to the average patient 
seen by practicing physicians. We hope to lend support 
to better decision-making surrounding ICD implanta-
tion since these studies incorporate a wider variety of 
comorbidities and draw most patients from large reg-
istries that include older patients. The present meta-
analysis suggests that primary prevention ICD therapy 
is associated with benefits in older patients and those 
with significant comorbidities.
Limitations: Part 2
Our analysis does carry limitations. One important con-
founder is the type of cardiomyopathy in these patients; 
most had an ischemic etiology limiting the applicabil-
ity to nonischemic patients. A RCT has suggested that 
ICDs are only beneficial in younger patients with non-
ischemic cardiomyopathy.64 Also, medication usage and 
adherence, which are known to improve cardiac func-
tion and ejection fraction, were not analyzed. We also 
did not include CRT, which carries additional benefit 
in selected patients who also meet primary prevention 
ICD eligibility criteria. After discussion, we elected not 
to report absolute risk or benefit of ICD use or number 
needed to treat in our analysis because of concerns for 
introducing assumptions that would decrease the value 
and reliability of any calculated results. Although we 
looked specifically at survival in our analysis, we could 
not assess other pertinent factors, such as quality of life 
and complications related to device implantation, which 
may play a significant role in the shared decision-mak-
ing for patients considering a primary prevention ICD. 
In addition, much of the data used in the meta-analysis 
is derived from observational and retrospective studies, 
some with a small sample size and wide CIs. Several 
substudies of the NCDR ICD Registry and GWTG-HF 
registry were used to determine benefit of prophylactic 
ICD implantation, and the potential overlap of patients 
may be a significant confounder in our analysis despite 
our efforts to limit this effect. In addition, these analy-
ses used propensity scoring to adjust for confounding 
that may be insufficient for identifying similar patient 
populations.65 Of note, other strategies such as decision 
analysis modeling may provide information on the po-
tential use of any therapy such as ICD in the setting of 
competing comorbidities66,67 Finally, with much of the 
data being from nonrandomized data sources, we can 
state there is an association of primary prevention ICD 
implantation and reduction in mortality seen in both 
older patients and those with significant comorbidities, 
but a cause-and-effect cannot be established. None of 
the observational studies included in our analyses used 
strategies such as prespecified falsification analysis to 
identify spurious correlations.68 Even if such statistical 
methods were used, selection bias and unidentified 
confounding biases can be potentially addressed but 
never fully adjusted for.

This table represents the relationships of evidence review committee members with industry and other entities that were determined to be relevant to this 
document. These relationships were reviewed and updated in conjunction with all meetings and/or conference calls of the writing committee during the document 
development process. The table does not necessarily reflect relationships with industry at the time of publication. A person is deemed to have a significant interest 
in a business if the interest represents ownership of ≥5% of the voting stock or share of the business entity, or ownership of ≥$5,000 of the fair market value of 
the business entity; or if funds received by the person from the business entity exceed 5% of the person’s gross income for the previous year. Relationships that 
exist with no financial benefit are also included for the purpose of transparency. Relationships in this table are modest unless otherwise noted.
According to the ACC/AHA, a person has a relevant relationship IF: a) the relationship or interest relates to the same or similar subject matter, intellectual 
property or asset, topic, or issue addressed in the document; or b) the company/entity (with whom the relationship exists) makes a drug, drug class, or device 
addressed in the document or makes a competing drug or device addressed in the document; or c) the person or a member of the person’s household, has a 
reasonable potential for financial, professional or other personal gain or loss as a result of the issues/content addressed in the document.
*For transparency, the ERC members’ comprehensive disclosure information is available as an online supplement.
