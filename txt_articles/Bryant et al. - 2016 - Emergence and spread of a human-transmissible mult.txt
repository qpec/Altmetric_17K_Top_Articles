Abstract
Lung infections with Mycobacterium abscessus, a species of multidrug resistant nontuberculous 
mycobacteria, are emerging as an important global threat to individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) 
where they accelerate inflammatory lung damage leading to increased morbidity and mortality. 
Previously, M. abscessus was thought to be independently acquired by susceptible individuals 
from the environment. However, using whole genome analysis of a global collection of clinical 
isolates, we show that the majority of M. abscessus infections are acquired through transmission, 
potentially via fomites and aerosols, of recently emerged dominant circulating clones that have 
spread globally. We demonstrate that these clones are associated with worse clinical outcomes, 
show increased virulence in cell-based and mouse infection models, and thus represent an urgent 
international infection challenge.
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM; referring to mycobacterial species other than M. 
tuberculosis complex and M. leprae) are ubiquitous environmental organisms that can cause 
chronic pulmonary infections in susceptible individuals [1, 2], particularly those with pre-
existing inflammatory lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) [3]. The major NTM 
infecting CF individuals around the world is Mycobacterium abscessus; a rapidly growing, 
intrinsically multidrug-resistant species, which can be impossible to treat despite prolonged 
combination antibiotic therapy [1, 3–5], leads to accelerated decline in lung function [6,7], 
and remains a contraindication to lung transplantation in many centers [3,8,9].
Until recently, NTM infections were thought to be independently acquired by individuals 
through exposure to soil or water [10–12]. As expected, previous analyses from the 1990s 
and 2000s [13–16] showed that CF patients were infected with unique, genetically diverse 
strains of M. abscessus, presumably from environmental sources. We used whole genome 
sequencing at a single UK CF center and identified two clusters of patients (11 individuals in 
total) infected with identical or near-identical M. abscessus isolates, which social network 
analysis suggested were acquired within hospital via indirect transmission between patients 
[17]; a possibility further supported by genomic sequencing [18] of a separate M. abscessus 
outbreak in a Seattle CF center [19].

 Given the increasing incidence of M. abscessus infections in CF and non-CF populations 
reported globally [3, 20, 21], we investigated whether cross-infection, rather than 
independent environmental acquisition, might be the major source of infection for this 
organism and therefore undertook population-level, multinational, whole genome 
sequencing of M. abscessus isolates from infected CF patients, correlating results with 
clinical metadata and phenotypic functional analysis of isolates.
We generated whole genome sequences for 1080 clinical isolates of M. abscessus from 517 
patients, obtained from UK CF clinics and their associated regional reference laboratories, as 
well as CF Centres in the US (UNC Chapel Hill), the Republic of Ireland (Dublin), mainland 
Europe (Denmark, Sweden, The Netherlands), and Australia (Queensland). We identified 
730 isolates as M. a. abscessus, 256 isolates as M. a. massiliense, 91 isolates as M. a. 
bolletii, with three isolates (from 3 different patients) containing more than one subspecies.
Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences (using one isolate per patient), supplemented by 
published genomes from US, France, Brazil, Malaysia, China, and South Korea (Table S1), 
was performed and analysed in the context of the geographical provenance of isolates 
(Figure 1; Figure S1). As done previously [17], we obtained maximum likelihood 
phylogenetic trees demonstrating separation of M. abscessus into three clearly divergent 
subspecies (M. a. abscessus, M. a. bolletii, and M. a. massiliense), challenging recent 
reclassifications of M. abscessus into only two subspecies [22].
Within each subspecies, we found multiple examples of deep branches (indicating large 
genetic differences) between isolates from different individuals, consistent with independent 
acquisition of unrelated environmental bacteria. However, we also identified multiple clades 
of near-identical isolates from geographically diverse locations (Figure 1), suggesting 
widespread transmission of circulating clones within the global CF patient community.
To investigate further the relatedness of isolates from different individuals, we analysed each 
subspecies phylogeny for the presence of high density phylogenetic clusters (see 
Supplementary Methods [23]). We identified multiple dense clusters of isolates, 
predominantly within the M. a. abscessus and M. a. massiliense subspecies (Figure 2A), 
indicating the presence of dominant circulating clones. We next excluded clusters found in 
only one CF centre from further analysis to remove related isolates that might have been 
acquired from a local environmental point source. We found that most patients (74%) were 
infected with clustered, rather than unclustered, isolates, principally from M. a. abscessus 
Cluster 1 and 2, and M. a. massiliense Cluster 1 (Figure 2B). The median branch lengths of 
almost all clusters found in two or more CF centers was less than 20 SNPs (range 1-175 
SNPs), indicating a high frequency of identical or near identical isolates infecting 
geographically separate individuals.
To determine how much of the genetic relatedness found within clusters was attributable to 
recent transmission, we first examined the within-patient genetic diversity of M. abscessus 
isolates from single individuals. In keeping with our previously published results [17], we 
found that 90% of same-patient isolates differed by less than 20 SNPs, while 99% of same-
patient isolates differed by less than 38 SNPs (Figure S2). We therefore classified isolates

 from different individuals varying by less than 20 SNPs as indicating ‘probable’, and those 
varying by 20-38 SNPs as indicating ‘possible’, recent transmission (whether direct or 
indirect). We thereby identified multiple likely recent transmission chains in virtually all 
multi-site clusters of M. abscessus (Figure 2B), and across the majority of CF centers 
(Figure S3).
We next examined the global distribution of clustered isolates and found that, in all 
countries, the majority of patients were infected with clustered rather than unclustered 
isolates (Figure 2C; Table S2), suggesting frequent and widespread infection of patients with 
closely related isolates. Moreover, the three dominant circulating clones, M. a. abscessus 
Clusters 1 and 2, and M. a. massiliense Cluster 1, were all represented in the USA, 
European, and Australian collections of clinical isolates, indicating trans-continental 
dissemination of these clades.
We then compared the genetic differences between isolates (measured by pairwise SNP 
distance) as a function of geography. As expected from our previous detection of hospital-
based transmission of M. abscessus [17], average genetic distances were significantly shorter 
for M. abscessus isolates from the same CF center than those from different CF centers 
within the same country or from different countries (Figure 2D). However, we also detected 
numerous examples of identical or near-identical isolates infecting groups of patients in 
different CF centers and, indeed, across different countries (Figure 2D), indicating the recent 
global spread of M. abscessus clones throughout the international CF patient community.
We applied Bayesian analysis [24] to date the establishment and spread of dominant 
circulating clones (Figure S4, S5), focusing on M. a. massiliense Cluster 1, which includes 
isolates from both the Seattle [19] and Papworth [17] CF Center outbreaks, as well as 
isolates from CF centres across England (Birmingham, London, Leicester), Scotland 
(Lothian, Glasgow), Ireland (Dublin), Denmark (Copenhagen), Australia (Queensland), and 
the USA (Chapel Hill, NC) (Figure 3A). We estimate that the most recent common ancestor 
of isolates infecting patients from all these locations emerged around 1978 (95% CI: 
1955-1995), clearly indicating recent global dissemination of this dominant circulating clone 
amongst individuals with CF (Figure 3A).
Furthermore we were able to resolve individual transmission events between patients 
infected with dominant circulating clones through two orthogonal approaches. Firstly, using 
high-depth genomic sequencing of colony sweeps, we were able to track changes in within-
patient bacterial diversity in sputum cultures of a single individual over time. By linking the 
frequency of occurrence of minority variants in longitudinal samples, we were able to define 
the presence of particular subclones within infected individuals, assign their likely 
evolutionary development (involving the successive acquisition of non-synonymous 
mutations in likely virulence genes; Figure 3B), monitor their relative frequencies over time, 
and demonstrate their transmission between patients (Figure 3B). Secondly, through 
longitudinal whole genome sequencing of isolates collected over time from individuals, we 
were able to find multiple examples of the complete nesting of one patient’s sampled 
diversity within another’s (Figure S6). Such paraphyletic relationships are strongly 
indicative of recent person-to-person transmission [25].

 We next examined potential mechanisms of transmission of M. abscessus between 
individuals (which our previous epidemiological analysis had suggested was indirect rather 
than via direct contact between patients [17]). We provide proof of concept for fomite spread 
of M. abscessus (detecting three separate transmission events associated with surface 
contamination of an inpatient room by an individual infected with a dominant circulating 
clone; Figure S7), and also for potential airborne transmission (by experimentally 
demonstrating the generation of long-lived, potentially infectious cough aerosols by an 
infected CF patient; Figure S8).
A potential explanation for the emergence of dominant clones of M. abscessus is that they 
are more efficient at infection and/or transmission. We therefore analysed clinical metadata 
to establish whether outcomes were different for patients infected with clustered rather than 
unclustered isolates. We correlated clinical outcomes with bacterial phylogeny and the 
presence of constitutive resistance to two key NTM antibiotics, amikacin and macrolides 
[26, 27], acquired through point mutations in the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA respectively 
(Figure 4A). We found no differences in the proportions of M. abscessus-positive individuals 
diagnosed with ATS-defined NTM pulmonary disease [1], (namely the presence of two or 
more culture-positive sputum samples with NTM-associated symptoms and radiological 
changes), but did observe increased rates of chronic infection in individuals infected with 
clustered rather than unclustered isolates (Figure 4B). As anticipated for transmissible 
clones exposed to multiple rounds of antibiotic therapy, we also found high rates of 
constitutive amikacin and/or macrolide resistance in clustered isolates (Figure 4B). Of note, 
resistance to these two antibiotics did not necessarily result in a poor clinical outcomes 
(Figure S9), suggesting that additional bacterial factors might contribute to worse responses 
in patients infected with clustered isolates.
To explore differences in intrinsic virulence between clustered and unclustered M. 
abscessus, we subjected a panel of representative isolates (27 clustered and 17 unclustered 
M. a. abscessus; 25 clustered and 13 unclustered M. a. massiliense) to a series of in vitro 
phenotypic assays. While we found no or only minor differences between groups in their 
colony morphotype, biofilm formation, ability to trigger cytokine release from macrophages 
(Figure S10) and their overall phenotypic profile (by multifactorial analysis; Figure S11), we 
detected significantly increased phagocytic uptake (Figure 4C) and intracellular survival in 
macrophages (Figure 4D) of clustered isolates of both M. a. abscessus and M. a. massiliense 
compared to unclustered controls, indicating clear differences in pathogenic potential. 
Moreover, infection of SCID mice revealed significantly greater bacterial burden (Figure 4E) 
and granulomatous inflammation (Figure 4F) following inoculation with clustered rather 
than unclustered isolates of M. a. abscessus and M. a. massiliense, confirming differences in 
virulence between these groups.
In summary, our results reveal that the majority of M. abscessus infections of individuals 
with CF worldwide are caused by genetically-clustered isolates, suggesting recent 
transmission, rather than independent acquisition of genetically-unrelated environmental 
organisms. Given the widespread implementation of individual and cohort segregation of 
patients in CF centres in Europe [28], the USA [29], and Australia [30] (which have led to 
falling levels of MRSA, Burkholderia, and transmissible Pseudomonas infections [31–33]), 
Bryant et al.

 we believe that the likely mechanism of local spread of M. abscessus is via fomite spread or 
potentially through the generation of long-lived infectious aerosols (as identified for other 
CF pathogens [34–36]). Although further research is needed, both transmission routes are 
plausible given our findings (Figures S7, S8), and would be potentially enhanced by the 
intrinsic desiccation resistance of M. abscessus. Such indirect transmission, involving 
environmental contamination by patients, is supported by our previous social network 
analysis of a UK outbreak of M. abscessus [17] in CF patients, which revealed hospital-
based cross-infection without direct person-to-person contact, and by the termination of a 
Seattle M. abscessus outbreak associated with the introduction of clinic room negative 
pressure ventilation and double room cleaning [19]. The long-distance spread of circulating 
clones is more difficult to explain. Importantly we found no evidence of CF patients or of 
equipment moving between CF centers in different countries indicating that the global 
spread of M. abscessus may be driven by alternative human, zoonotic or environmental 
vectors of transmission.
Our study illustrates the power of population-level genomics to uncover modes of 
transmission of emerging pathogens and has revealed the recent emergence of global 
dominant circulating clones of M. abscessus that have spread between continents. These 
clones are better able to survive within macrophages, cause more virulent infection in mice, 
and are associated with worse clinical outcomes, suggesting that the establishment of 
transmission chains may have permitted multiple rounds of within-host genetic adaptation to 
allow M. abscessus to evolve from an environmental organism to a true lung pathogen.

 Figure 1. Global phylogeny of clinical isolates of M. abscessus.
Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of clinical isolates of M. abscessus collected with 
relevant local and/or national Ethical Board approval from 517 patients (using one isolate 
per patient), obtained from UK CF clinics and their associated regional reference 
laboratories, CF Centres in the US (UNC Chapel Hill), the Republic of Ireland (Dublin), 
mainland Europe (Denmark, Sweden, The Netherlands), and Australia (Queensland), 
supplemented by published genomes from US, France, Brazil, Malaysia, China, and South 
Korea (listed in Table S1).

 Figure 2. Transcontinental spread of dominant circulating clones.
(A). Hierarchical branch density analysis of phylogenetic trees for each subspecies of M. 
abscessus identifies multiple clusters of closely related isolates predominantly within the M. 
a. abscessus and M. a. massiliense subspecies (numbered, and spectrally coloured red to 
blue, from most densely clustered to least; black indicating no significant clustering). (B). 
Analysis of M. abscessus clusters found in two or more CF centers showing (top) numbers 
of patients infected with each cluster (grey bars) or unclustered isolates (green) and median 
branch length (SNPs) of different patients’ isolates within each cluster (blue circles);

 (bottom) numbers of potential recent transmission events with < 20 SNPs (red) or 20 - 38 
SNPs (yellow) difference between isolates from different patients. (C) Global distribution of 
clustered M. abscessus isolates showing M. a. abscessus Cluster 1 (red) and Cluster 2 
(green), M. a. massiliense Cluster 1 (blue), other clustered isolates (grouped together for 
clarity; white) and unclustered isolates (black) with numbers of patients (n) sampled per 
location. (D) Genetic differences between isolates (measured by pairwise SNP distance) 
from different patients attending the same CF center, different CF centers within the same 
country, or CF centers in different countries (boxes indicate median and interquartile range; 
p values obtained from Mann Whitney Rank Sum tests). To exclude multiple highly distant 
comparisons, for each isolate only the smallest pairwise distance with an isolate from 
another patient is included. Colour coding indicates whether there were < 20 SNPs 
difference (red), 20-38 SNPs difference (yellow), or >38 SNPs difference (grey) between 
isolates from different patients.

 Figure 3. Dating the emergence of dominant circulating clones.
(A). Dating the emergence of the M. a. massiliense Cluster 1 (responsible for the Papworth 
and Seattle CF center outbreaks), using Bayesian analysis, with geographical annotation of 
isolates within the cluster. (B). Predicted evolution of subclones (identified through minority 
variant linkage; see Supplementary Methods [23]) within a single patient with CF (Patient 2 
from Ref. 19) chronically infected with the dominant circulating clone Massiliense Cluster 1 
(representative of a total of 11 patients studied). (i) Analysis revealed successive acquisition 
of non-synonymous polymorphisms (NS) by the most common recent ancestral clone 
(MRCA; white) in potential virulence genes (UBiA, MAB_0173; Crp/Fnr, MAB_0416c; 
mmpS, MAB_0477; PhoR, MAB_0674) and then transmission of a single subclone to 
another patient from the same CF center (Patient 28 from Ref. 19). (ii) Frequency of each 
subclone within longitudinal sputum isolates analysed during the course of Patient 2’s 
infection and the subsequent transmission of a subclone to Patient 28. We observed 
considerable heterogeneity in the detected repertoire of subclones within each sputum 
sample (vertical rectangles coloured to illustrate the proportion of detected subclones coded 
as for (i) in each sputum sample), reflecting either temporal fluctuations in dominant sub-
lineages or variable sampling of geographical diversity of subclones within the lung (as 
previously described for P. aeruginosa [37]). Previously determined opportunities for 
hospital-based cross-infection between the two patients (using social network and 
epidemiologic analysis [17]), are shown in grey vertical bars.

isolates (one isolate per patient) with dominant circulating clones M. a. abscessus 1 (Absc 
1), abscessus 2 (Absc 2), and M. a. massiliense (Mass 1) highlighted (grey). For each isolate, 
clinical data (where available) was used to determine whether (column 1) the infected 
patient fulfilled the ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM pulmonary disease, namely the presence of 
two or more culture-positive sputum samples with NTM-associated symptoms and

 radiological changes [1] (yes: blue; no: orange); whether (column 2) isolates have acquired 
amikacin resistance (through 16S rRNA mutations; red), macrolide resistance (through 23S 
rRNA mutations; yellow), or both (orange- B only); and whether (column 3) patients culture 
converted (green) or remained chronically infected (red) with M. abscessus. (C, D). In vitro 
phenotyping of representative isolates of clustered (blue) and unclustered (green) M. a. 
abscessus and clustered (red) and unclustered (yellow) M. a. massiliense comparing 
phagocytosis by (C) and intracellular survival (normalised for uptake) within (D) 
differentiated THP1 cells. Data points represent averages of at least three independent 
replicates. (E, F) Using SCID mice, infection with clustered M. a. abscessus (blue) and M. 
a. massiliense (red) led to (E) greater intracellular survival within (i) bone marrow-derived 
macrophages in vitro and (ii) higher bacterial burdens in lung and spleen after in vivo 
inoculation with 1 x 107 bacilli per animal with (F) worse granulomatous lung inflammation 
(arrowheads), than unclustered controls (M. a. abscessus green; M. a. massiliense yellow), 
scale bar x 4. CFU data is shown as mean ± sem; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005 (two-tailed 
unpaired Student’s t-test).
