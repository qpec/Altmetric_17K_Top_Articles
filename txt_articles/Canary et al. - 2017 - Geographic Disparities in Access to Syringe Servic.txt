Using commercial laboratory data, we found 80% of 29 382 
young persons currently infected with hepatitis C virus lived 
>10 miles from a syringe services program. The median dis-
tance was 37 miles, with greater distances in rural areas and 
Southern and Midwestern states. Strategies to improve access to 
preventive services are warranted.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne infection causing increas-
ing mortality rates in the United States [1]. National surveillance 
data indicate that after a decade of declining acute HCV infection 
rates, the incidence began to increase in 2010, more than doubling 
from 2010 to 2014. The largest increase was among persons aged 
20–29 years in nonurban areas, driven by sharing of injection 
equipment among persons who inject drugs (PWID) [1–3].
Although preventing and treating substance abuse addiction 
are vital for averting the growing epidemic of opioid abuse, 
harm reduction interventions are also needed as part of a com-
prehensive strategy to prevent transmission of HCV and other 
blood-borne infections among active PWID [4, 5]. Syringe ser-
vices programs (SSPs) promote safe injection practices by pro-
viding education and exchanging used injection equipment for 
clean equipment. Moreover, they may serve as a crucial public 
health point of access for hard-to-reach, stigmatized communi-
ties of PWID [6] to offer HCV/human immunodeficiency virus 
testing, linkage to healthcare, referrals for opioid substitution 
therapy and substance abuse treatment programs, and access to 
overdose prevention tools [7]. Despite a lack of direct evidence 
of effectiveness against HCV transmission, demonstrated effec-
tiveness of needle and syringe programs for human immuno-
deficiency virus prevention and reduction of risky injection 
behaviors [8] suggest that SSPs are a vital tool for HCV pre-
vention [5]. There is considerable geographic variability in the 
number and capacity of SSPs in the United States [9]. We exam-
ined the geographic distribution of SSPs relative to the num-
ber of young persons with HCV infection tested at the 2 largest 
commercial laboratories in the United States.
METHODS
The analysis included persons aged 15–29 years who had an HCV 
RNA test conducted at Quest Diagnostics (Quest) or Laboratory 
Corporation of America (LabCorp) from 1 July 2015 through 
30 June 2016, and who had detectable HCV RNA (deemed cur-
rently HCV infected). Assays used by the commercial laborato-
ries to quantitatively and qualitatively assess presence of HCV 
RNA included COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS TaqMan (version 
2.0), NGI QuantaSURE, Aptima, and Abbot m2000. HCV RNA 
tests that were known or suspected to originate from correc-
tional facilities were excluded. Patients were mapped according 
to the residential (billing) zip code associated with their earliest 
positive HCV RNA result. For records missing a residential zip 
code, that of the ordering provider was used. Laboratory test 
results were obtained by the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Tests were deduplicated within 
each laboratory for records that had sufficient demographic 
information to assign unique anonymized patient identification 
numbers. Because these numbers were assigned by each labora-
tory independently, it was not possible to identify persons who 
may have been tested at both laboratories. Programs provid-
ing syringe services as of June 2016 were identified through a 
directory maintained by the North American Syringe Exchange 
Network (www.nasen.org).
SSP addresses were geocoded based on zip code (when 
available), city, and state. The distance, in miles, between zip 
code centroids of patient residences and SSPs was calculated. 
Proximity to an SSP was arbitrarily defined as “near” for dis-
tances ≤10 miles (16 093 m), and “far” for distances >10 miles 
[10]. The zip codes were translated to county and state using 
the SAS software zip code file. Level of urbanicity was assigned 
based on the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban-
Rural Classification Scheme for Counties [11]. States were 
grouped by US Census Bureau region. We used χ2 tests to assess 
differences in proximity to SSPs across census regions and lev-
els of urbanicity; differences were considered statistically sig-
nificant at P < .05. SAS software (version 9.3) was used for all

geocoding, mapping, calculating distance, and performing pre-
liminary location-allocation analysis.
RESULTS
A total of 29 382 (18 264 from Quest and 11 118 from LabCorp) 
persons aged 15–29 years with current HCV infection were 
identified. They were tested from July 2015 through June 2016 
and represented all 50 states and Washington, DC; 54% were 
female, and overall their median age was 25 years. The major-
ity of persons (86.8%) could be mapped to residential zip code, 
though 13.1% were mapped to ordering provider zip code and 
0.1% were excluded from spatial analysis owing to missing zip 
code. The geographic distribution of persons with HCV infec-
tion and proximity to SSPs is illustrated in Figure 1. The median 
distance to an SSP was 37 miles (interquartile range, 14–76 
miles (22 531–122 310 meters); range, 0–667 miles (0–1 073 432 
meters). Overall, 23 494 HCV-infected young persons (80.0%) 
resided far (>10 miles) from an SSP (Table 1).
Proximity to SSPs varied significantly across levels of urbani-
city of the county in which the patient resided (P < .001). The 
proportion of young HCV-infected persons living far from 
an SSP increased with decreasing urbanicity: 47% of those in 
the most urban (large central metropolitan) areas compared 
with 98% of those in the most rural (noncore) areas resided 
far from SSPs. Proximity also varied significantly by census 
region; the proportion of patients residing near an SSP was 
highest in the West (35.8%) and lowest in the South (9.9%) 
(Table 1; P < .001), although highly variable by state. Location-
allocation analyses estimated that to reach most (95%) of the 
persons currently residing far from an SSP, approximately 
2200 additional programs would need to be established (not 
shown).
DISCUSSION
Our findings demonstrate that >23 000 young persons identified 
with current HCV infection in the United States over a 1-year 
period had limited access to SSP services. Given that injection 
drug use is the primary cause of HCV infection among young 
persons, better access to SSPs could have been a useful tool to 
prevent many of these HCV infections and reduce the risk of 
transmission to others.
We found proximity to SSPs generally decreased with 
decreasing urbanicity in a dose-related manner. These results 
align with previous findings that SSPs operating in geograph-
ically remote settings are limited in their numbers, budget, 
and capacity [9]. The higher proportion of persons without 
access to SSPs in rural areas with some of the highest rates 
of illicit opioid and heroin injection and reported cases of 
HCV [3] highlight the inherent challenges in reaching PWID 
in remote settings, and the recent increase in HCV infection 
incidence in rural areas underscores the need for expanded 
delivery of harm reduction services. However, it should be 
noted that in some states access is limited in both urban and 
rural areas.
This study showed that in any region of the country less than 
half of young persons infected with HCV are located near SSPs. 
However, the larger gaps in access in the South and Midwest, 
suggest that our ability to interrupt HCV transmission and 
avert potential epidemics among PWIDs may be most limited 
in these regions. Geographic differences in SSP access, such as 
large areas where no SSPs currently exist, suggest insufficient

capacity to address potential epidemics of HCV infection 
among PWID in some areas where risk of an epidemic is great-
est [12]. 
Reasons for the geographic disparities may be myriad and 
point to the need not just to consider how to improve access to 
SSPs in rural areas but also to understand the legal, financial, 
and social barriers to establishment, funding, and use of SSPs. 
Indeed, despite the recent lifting of the ban on federal funding 
for syringe exchange, the impact of state laws and jurisdictional 
syringe exchange authorization on establishment and utiliza-
tion of SSPs warrants closer examination [13]. The estimation 
that >2200 additional programs would be needed to reach most 
cases residing “far” from an SSP in this analysis points to the 
need for strategies to improve access to HCV preventive ser-
vices, such as the establishment of additional SSPs, the mobili-
zation of programs to reach dispersed populations, and the use 
of existing infrastructure, such as local health departments and/
or pharmacies.
This report should be interpreted in light of several limita-
tions. First, this analysis was limited to persons with current 
HCV infection who were tested at 2 commercial laboratories, 
thus excluding persons identified at other laboratories; given 
regional disparities in coverage by the laboratories, we may 
have underestimated the case burden in rural areas and some 
regions such as the northern Midwest and Pacific Northwest. 
Persons for whom patient identification numbers were not 
assigned were also excluded from this analysis, which may have 
resulted in an underestimate of cases. Second, we were unable 
to link persons across laboratories, which could have resulted 
in some persons being counted more than once. However, we 
deem it unlikely that multiple RNA tests would be conducted 
on the same person at different laboratories in a given year. 
Third, the definition of 10 miles as a close proxim-
ity to SSP may not reflect actual ease of use; other factors

associated with limited access to services, such as legal 
acceptability, public transportation access, and functional 
capacity of SSPs, including use of satellite locations or mobile 
units, were not assessed in this analysis. The fact that some 
SSPs may offer HCV RNA testing may have resulted in more 
cases being identified near SSPs. Finally, the cross-sectional 
nature of this study precluded an examination of the tem-
poral relationship between number of persons with current 
HCV infection and establishment of SSPs. Future analyses 
are planned to evaluate whether improved access to SSPs and 
other interventions can reduce the number of HCV infec-
tions reported to state health departments and identified 
through laboratory testing.
In summary, the analysis shows that large numbers of young 
persons with HCV infection have limited access to SSPs dur-
ing a time of increasing incidence of HCV infection driven 
by unsafe injection drug use [1]. Addressing the large gaps in 
access to harm reduction services is paramount for preventing 
continued HCV transmission among PWID.
