Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic childhood epilepsy with early-onset seizures, delayed language and motor development, sleep
disturbances, anxiety-like behaviour, severe cognitive deficit and an increased risk of fatality. It is primarily caused by de novo
mutations of the SCN1A gene encoding a neuronal voltage-activated sodium channel. Zebrafish with a mutation in the SCN1A
homologue recapitulate spontaneous seizure activity and mimic the convulsive behavioural movements observed in Dravet syn-
drome. Here, we show that phenotypic screening of drug libraries in zebrafish scn1 mutants rapidly and successfully identifies new
therapeutics. We demonstrate that clemizole binds to serotonin receptors and its antiepileptic activity can be mimicked by drugs
acting on serotonin signalling pathways e.g. trazodone and lorcaserin. Coincident with these zebrafish findings, we treated five
medically intractable Dravet syndrome patients with a clinically-approved serotonin receptor agonist (lorcaserin, Belviq�) and
observed some promising results in terms of reductions in seizure frequency and/or severity. Our findings demonstrate a rapid path
from preclinical discovery in zebrafish, through target identification, to potential clinical treatments for Dravet syndrome.

Introduction
Childhood epilepsies classified as catastrophic are often
associated with a genetic mutation. Among these, Dravet
syndrome has been linked to more than 600 de novo mu-
tations in a single gene, SCN1A (Catterall et al., 2010;
Escayg et al., 2010). Children suffering with Dravet syn-
drome exhibit seizures starting as early as 6 months of age,
delayed language and motor development, sleep disturb-
ances, anxiety-like behaviour and severe cognitive deficit
(Dravet, 2011). Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder
have also been reported (Li et al., 2011) and the risk for
sudden unexplained death with epilepsy (SUDEP) in this
population is estimated at 15-fold higher than other child-
hood epilepsies (Kearney, 2013). Available antiepileptic
drugs do not offer adequate seizure control and resective
neurosurgical procedures are not commonly an option.
New treatments for Dravet syndrome remain an important
unmet need despite some level of efficacy in limited clinical
trials

 (Diacomit�), which can be associated with cognitive or ap-
petite safety concerns, respectively (Perez et al., 1999;
Chiron et al., 2000; Detyniecki et al., 2016; Devinsky
et al., 2016).
Mutations in SCN1A, a gene encoding the pore-forming
�-subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.1), have
been identified in nearly 85% of patients with Dravet syn-
drome (Dravet, 2011). Nav1.1 channels contribute to the
fast depolarization of neuronal membranes seen during
action potential generation (Hodgkin et al., 1952). Mice
heterozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in Nav1.1 de-
velop spontaneous and temperature-sensitive seizures early
in life, and die prematurely around postnatal Day 25 (Yu
et al., 2006; Oakley et al., 2009; Cheah et al., 2012). Acute
electrophysiology studies in these and related Scn1a-defi-
cient mice suggest a reduction in sodium current density
and an associated decrease in the firing activity for a sub-
population of GABA-expressing inhibitory neurons (but not
excitatory principal cells) culminating in reduced synaptic
inhibition and network hyperexcitability (Yu et al., 2006;
Kalume et al., 2007; Han et al., 2012). This ‘interneurono-
pathy’ hypothesis is consistent with other forms of cata-
strophic childhood epilepsies and was confirmed in mice
where Scn1a was selectively deleted from parvalbumin- or
somatostatin-expressing
interneuron
subpopulations
(Dutton et al., 2013; Tai et al., 2014). Autistic-like behav-
iours were also reported in these mice (Han et al., 2012).
Interestingly, initial studies on human excitatory and inhibi-
tory neurons derived using induced pluripotent stem cell
technology from two patients with Dravet syndrome re-
ported deficits in voltage-activated sodium current for
both cell types, suggesting either homeostatic compensation
for the early loss-of-function of a critical brain-specific
sodium channel, or additional mechanisms contributing to
the epileptic phenotype observed in these patients (Jiao
et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013).
Although mice and human induced pluripotent stem cell-
derived neurons contribute to our understanding of the
underlying pathophysiology of Dravet syndrome, these sys-
tems are not well suited for the rapid identification of new
therapies due to the variability of these models and repro-
ducibility of quantitative measurements. As zebrafish are an
ideal vertebrate model system for performing small mol-
ecule phenotype-based screens (MacRae et al., 2015), and
are amenable to genetic manipulations, we focused our ef-
forts on a zebrafish sodium channel mutant. Zebrafish mu-
tants harbouring a loss-of-function missense mutation in
the SCN1A orthologue, scn1Lab, were identified in a mu-
tagenesis screen (Schoonheim et al., 2010). Due to an an-
cestral
whole
genome
duplication,
zebrafish
scn1Lab
mutants are haploinsufficient for Nav1.1 and analogous
to Scn1a + /� mice or patients with Dravet syndrome.
Convulsive behaviours and episodes of brief interictal and
long-duration polyspike ictal-like electrographic discharge
are observed in mutant larvae as early as 3 days post-fer-
tilization (dpf) with progression to more robust seizure
phenotypes between 4 and 7 dpf (Baraban et al., 2013;
Hong et al., 2016). Mutant larvae die prematurely, exhibit
metabolic deficits (Kumar et al., 2016), and are resistant to
many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (Dinday et al., 2015).
Similar to the clinical management of Dravet syndrome,
some attenuation of seizure activity can be obtained with
valproate, benzodiazepines, bromides, stiripentol, as well as
a ketogenic diet (Baraban et al., 2013). Using scn1Lab
mutant zebrafish larvae and a two-stage phenotype-based
screening strategy, we have now screened more than 2300
compounds. Clemizole, a first-generation histamine recep-
tor (H1) antagonist, was identified as a potent inhibitor of
behavioural and electrographic seizure activity (Baraban
et al., 2013). Antihistamines, however, are contraindicated
in paediatric epilepsy populations (Miyata et al., 2011) and
the H1 receptor analogue in zebrafish shows less than 50%
similarity to human (Peitsaro et al., 2007). Here, we use
preclinical zebrafish models to demonstrate that clemizole,
but not antihistamines, exert antiepileptic activity. On the
basis of ligand binding and additional targeted drug screen-
ing in scn1 mutant zebrafish, we identified several serotonin
(5-HT) modulators as effective in suppressing seizures,
including two (trazodone and lorcaserin) FDA-approved
compounds. Lorcaserin (Belviq�) was prescribed under a
compassionate use programme to children with Dravet syn-
drome and resulted in reduced seizure activity in some pa-
tients. We propose that modulation of 5-HT signalling
represents a novel therapeutic intervention for this cata-
strophic childhood epilepsy.
Materials and methods
Zebrafish maintenance
Zebrafish
were
maintained
in
a
light-
and
temperature-
controlled aquaculture facility under a standard 14:10 h light/
dark photoperiod. Adult zebrafish were housed in 1.5 l tanks
at a density of 5–12 fish per tank and fed twice per day (dry
flake and/or flake supplemented with live brine shrimp). Water
quality was continuously monitored: temperature, 28–30�C;
pH 7.4–8.0; conductivity, 690–710 mS/cm. Zebrafish embryos
were maintained in round Petri dishes in ‘embryo medium’
consisting of 0.03% Instant Ocean (Aquarium Systems, Inc.)
and 0.0002% methylene blue in reverse osmosis-distilled
water. Zebrafish larvae were obtained from crosses of wild-
type (TL strain) or scn1Lab (didys552) or scn1Laa (sa1674)
heterozygous animals that had been outcrossed to the TL
strain. Homozygous scn1Lab mutants (n = 2800) have dis-
persed melanosomes and appear visibly darker by 3 dpf com-
pared to wild-type larvae. Homozygous scn1Laa mutants were
initially identified using behavioural and electrophysiology
assays on all offspring (n = 288; Fig. 1) and confirmed by
post hoc polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as they appear vis-
ibly similar to wild-type larvae. The care and maintenance
protocols comply with requirements outlined in the Guide
for the Care and Use of Animals (ebrary Inc., 2011) and
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (protocol # AN108659-02).

 Seizure monitoring
At 5 dpf individual zebrafish larvae were placed into a single
well of a clear flat-bottomed 96-well microplate containing
embryo
media.
Larvae
were
selected
randomly
as
sex
determination is not possible at this stage. Microplates were
placed inside the DanioVision motion-tracking device and
acclimated for 20 min at room temperature. Locomotion
plots were obtained for each well during a recording epoch
of 10 min using a DanioVision system running EthoVision XT

 software
(DanioVision,
Noldus
Information
Technology);
threshold detection settings to identify objects darker than
the background were optimized for each experiment. Seizure
scoring was performed using the following three-stage scale
established for pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures (Baraban
et al., 2005): Stage 0, no or very little swim activity; Stage I,
increased, brief bouts of swim activity; Stage II, rapid ‘whirl-
pool-like’ circling swim behaviour; and Stage III, paroxysmal
whole-body clonus-like convulsions, and a brief loss of pos-
ture. Wild-type fish are normally scored at Stage 0 or I. Plots
were analysed for distance travelled (in millimetres) and mean
velocity (in millimetres per second). As reported previously
(Winter et al., 2008; Baraban et al., 2013), velocity changes
were the most sensitive assay of seizure behaviour.
For electrophysiology studies, zebrafish larvae were briefly
paralysed with �-bungarotoxin (1 mg/ml) and immobilized in
1.2% agarose; local field potential recordings were obtained
from forebrain structures using a single-electrode technique, as
previously described (Baraban et al., 2005; Hong et al., 2016).
Agarose-embedded local field potential recording sessions of
10 to 30 min were obtained for each fish at 1 kHz. The
iZAP system (Hong et al., 2016) was used for long-term
non-invasive monitoring of zebrafish in the absence of a paral-
ysing agent. The system autonomously traps several zebrafish
larvae underneath multiple integrated surface electrodes within
the microfluidic chambers. scn1Lab larvae were continuously
monitored for 5 h. Electrical field potential was recorded at
1 kHz continuously except 2- to 3-min breaks for media
change for compound treatment and washing. The recorded
data was analysed by using MATLAB for field potential
graphs and frequency analysis.
Compound library screening
Compounds for drug screening were purchased from Selleck
Chemicals and were provided as 10 mM DMSO solutions.
Selleck’s Ion Channel Ligand Library (Catalogue #L2700),
GPCR Compound Library (Catalogue #L2200) and a custo-
mized 5-HT modulating library were used for screening.
Library compounds are listed in Supplementary Table 1. In
all drug library screens, compounds were coded and experi-
ments were performed by investigators who were blind to the
nature of the compound. Baseline recordings of locomotion
behaviour were obtained from mutants in embryo media, as
described above; a second locomotion plot was then obtained
following a solution change to a test compound and an equili-
bration period of 20 min. Compounds for locomotion studies
were dissolved in embryo media and were tested at a concen-
tration of 250 mM, with a final DMSO concentration of 2.5%.
Criteria for a positive hit designation were as follows: (i) a
decrease in mean velocity of 540%; and (ii) a reduction to
Stage 0 or Stage I seizure behaviour in the locomotion plot for
at least 50% of the test fish. Each test compound classified as a
‘positive hit’ in the locomotion assay was assessed for toxicity
by direct visualization on a stereomicroscope following a
90 min drug exposure. Toxicity (or mortality) was defined as
no visible heartbeat or movement in response to external
stimulation in at least 50% of the test fish. Hyperexcitability
was defined as a compound causing a 540% increase in swim
velocity and/or Stage III seizure activity in at least 50% of the
test fish. Positive hits identified in the primary locomotion
screen
were
confirmed
using
the
locomotion
screening
method in a second assay with an independent clutch of zebra-
fish. Compounds were then purchased separately from Sigma-
Aldrich and tested using the locomotion screening method for
a third time on an independent clutch of zebrafish. Drugs that
reduced the mean swim velocity above threshold and were
non-toxic in the three independent locomotion assays were
further analysed using the electrophysiological assay. In elec-
trophysiology studies, drugs were first confirmed at a concen-
tration of 250 mM using the locomotion assay and then
the same zebrafish was evaluated using a local field poten-
tial recording. All screening was done with coded compounds
and analysed by investigators blinded to the compound
identity.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of human HTR2 and zebrafish Htr2 pro-
tein sequences were performed with the PhyML software
under the SH-like likelihood-ratio test parameters (http://
www.phylogeny.fr/) (Dereeper et al., 2008). Protein sequences
were
derived
from

HTR2B
(ENST00000258400),

(ENSDART00000024191)
sequences.
Quantitative real-time mRNA
expression analysis
The expression levels of zebrafish htr2 genes were examined
using RNA pooled from 25 heads or tails from 5 dpf wild-type
or scn1Lab homozygous mutant larvae, and dissected brains
from individual wild-type adult male zebrafish. Total RNA
was extracted using TRIzol� Reagent (Invitrogen), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol and treated with DNase I
(Invitrogen). Purified mRNA was retrotranscribed to cDNA
using
SuperScript�III
First-Strand
Synthesis
System
(Invitrogen) with a mix of oligo(dT)20. The expression levels
of zebrafish htr2 genes and the housekeeping gene eukaryotic
translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1, like 1 (eef1a1l1) was
determined
using
a
StepOne
TM
Real-Time
PCR
machine
(Applied Biosystems). Reactions were performed in 20 ml vol-
umes on 96-well plates using SYBR�Green Master Mix
(Applied

with
250 nM
primer
and
3 ml
of
cDNA. Oligonucleotide sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table 2. Data were analysed from three independent experi-
ments. Data were expressed as Ct values and used to deter-
mine �Ct values.
Human studies
After successful identification of compounds in our zebrafish
model and consideration of pharmacokinetics, children were
prescribed Belviq� (lorcaserin) under a compassionate use
protocol at Children’s Hospital Colorado (IND 125307).
Children qualified for use of Belviq� if they had an SCN1A
mutation or a clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome, and
failed at least two medications including stiripentol in some
cases and excluding sodium channel blockers. Children were
required to have an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram at

 baseline and every 6 months during use of the product. In
addition, they were required to have follow-up visits every 3
months to ensure adequate growth, as well as assess for add-
itional side effects. Laboratory testing was required every 6
months to include haematologic testing, liver function testing
and renal function testing. Belviq� dose was initiated at 2.5 mg
at bedtime and gradually increased weekly as needed to a
maximum dose of 10 mg twice a day or 0.3 mg/kg/day—
whichever occurred first.
Institutional review board approval was obtained for retro-
spective data collection including a waiver of consent. Data
were extracted from a retrospective review of electronic med-
ical records at Children’s Hospital Colorado including age,
seizure types and frequency prior and after use of Belviq�,
adverse events, dose of Belviq� and concomitant medication
use.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean � standard error of the mean
(SEM), unless otherwise stated. For comparison between two
groups Student’s t-test were used. When variance did not have
a normal distribution the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-
test was used. One-way ANOVA after either Dunnett’s mul-
tiple comparison test for analysis against a control sample or
Holm-Sidak pairwise multiple comparisons between means.
Differences considered statistically significant are indicated

Results
Effect of clemizole on seizure
behaviour in zebrafish
We treated scn1Lab mutant larvae (5 dpf) with clemizole at
concentrations between 30 and 400 mM and then moni-
tored the effect on spontaneous seizure behaviour using
automated locomotion tracking software. Based on 250 re-
peated locomotion control trials in untreated scn1Lab mu-
tants,
a
reduction
in
mean
swim
velocity
540%
(41.5 � SD) from baseline was set as the threshold for
positive suppression of seizure behaviour. Clemizole (Fig.
1A) exhibited antiepileptic activity at 300 and 400 mM (30-
min exposure) and at 100 mM (90-min exposure) (Fig. 1B);
prolonged exposures were toxic at the higher concentra-
tions. To determine if clemizole can suppress spontaneous
seizure behaviour in a second zebrafish scn1 mutant, we
screened mutant scn1Laa larvae (5 dpf) in the locomotion
tracking assay. Larvae identified as Stage III seizure behav-
iour (e.g. full body convulsions, high-speed swim activity
and a brief loss of posture; Fig. 1C) were confirmed as
exhibiting electrographic discharges with interictal- and
ictal-like components in subsequent field recordings from
the forebrain (Fig. 1D). Mean swim velocity for larvae
identified as S3 or ‘putative scn1Laa mutants’ zebrafish
was significantly higher than for sibling controls, or all
larvae
tested
(Fig.
1E);
mutants
were
confirmed
as
scn1Laa homozygotes by post hoc PCR. We then tested
drugs previously shown to suppress spontaneous seizures
in Dravet syndrome and scn1Lab mutants (250 mM stiri-
pentol and 250 mM diazepam) as well as 250 mM lamotri-
gine (an AED that can aggravate seizures in Dravet
syndrome). As expected stiripentol and diazepam, but not
lamotrigine, significantly suppressed seizure behaviour in
scn1Laa mutant larvae; 250 mM clemizole was also effect-
ive in this assay (Fig. 1F). Together, these studies demon-
strate that clemizole can suppress seizure behaviour in two
different scn1 mutant zebrafish lines.
Investigation of the mechanism of
action for clemizole
Because antihistamines are known to aggravate paediatric
epilepsies and zebrafish H1 shows poor homology with
human (Peitsaro et al., 2007), we hypothesized that clem-
izole does not exert antiepileptic activity via an anti-hista-
minergic mechanism of action. To test this hypothesis, we
searched our database for all compounds with anti-histima-
nergic properties. Forty-nine drugs from our screening
database of over 2300 compounds were identified. None
of these were effective in suppressing scn1Lab mutant seiz-
ure behaviour in the locomotion assay. Several increased
locomotor
activity
(thioperamide,
A4730,
mepyramine
maleate, R-methylhistamine, mebhydrolin napthalenesul-
phonate, clemastine fumarate, azatadine dimaleate, chlor-
pheniramine maleate, and clemastine fumarate) or were
found to be toxic (chlorpheniramine maleate, cinnarazine,
promethazine hydrochloride, desloratadine, hydroxyzine,
and cyclizine) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Next, a radioligand
binding assay was performed on 132 targets, including
various receptors, ion channels, transporters, enzymes and
second messengers (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). As
expected, clemizole has a very high antagonist binding af-
finity for the H1 receptor (99%). The next highest affinity,
as an agonist, was for two postsynaptic 5-HT receptor sub-
units, HTR2A (86%) and HTR2B (83%), respectively.
Other positively identified targets with percent inhibition
values between 50 and 78% included ion channel modula-
tors and other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
To determine if drugs modulating ion channels, GPCRs
or 5-HT signalling could recapitulate the seizure suppres-
sive activity of clemizole in scn1Lab mutant larvae, we
obtained commercially available compound libraries span-
ning these three categories. In blinded phenotype-based
screening, we tested compounds for their ability to reduce
mean swim velocity of 5 dpf scn1Lab mutants at a concen-
tration of 250 mM (n = 6 fish per drug). Plots for the first-
pass assay on all 368 compounds are shown in Fig. 3A–C.
Compounds that decreased movement (measured as a
change in mean velocity) by 540% were considered sig-
nificant. Five compounds from the ion channel ligand li-
brary (9.6%), 27 from the GPCR compound library
(10.6%),
and
10
from
the
5-HT
compound
library
(16.1%),
were
identified
as
positive
hits.

 retesting of these compounds was performed on a separate
clutch of scn1Lab mutants at 250 mM; an additional five
borderline compounds from the 5-HT library were also
retested. AEDs (sodium valproate and carbamazepine) pre-
viously evaluated in scn1Lab larvae (Baraban et al., 2013)
were not considered for further testing (Fig. 4). Of the re-
tested compounds, one from the ion channel library, six
from the GPCR compound library and two from the 5-
HT compound library were confirmed to decrease velocity.
Next, all identified compounds were unblinded and sourced
from commercial suppliers for a third behavioural assay
screen at 250 mM. TCB-2 was also further characterized
given its reported identification in decreasing epileptiform
activity (Sourbron et al., 2016). Across the three libraries,
100 compounds (27.1%) were identified as ‘toxic’ and 53
compounds (14.4%) were classified as ‘hyperexcitatory’ i.e.
resulted in increased swim velocity (Supplementary Table
1). Positive hits that were non-toxic in three independent
locomotion assays moved on to a secondary electrophysi-
ology assay.
Secondary drug screen using scn1Lab
mutants
Monitoring electrographic brain activity is a ‘gold stand-
ard’ in the epilepsy field, and can be achieved by placing a
microelectrode into a visually identified brain region of an
agar immobilized zebrafish. At 5 dpf, local field potential
recordings of scn1Lab zebrafish larvae show an average
of 20 abnormal electrographic seizure events during a 10-
min epoch with an average duration around 500 ms.
scn1Lab zebrafish larvae were treated with compounds
first confirmed to suppress locomotion behaviour and
then
subjected
to
local
field
potential
monitoring.
Trazodone, lorcaserin and detomidine suppressed the fre-
quency of these electrographic seizure events (Fig. 5A).

seizure behaviour for 5 dpf scn1Lab mutants screened against (A) 52 ion channel ligands, (B) 254 compound GPCR ligands, and (C) 65 5-HT
modulating compounds. Threshold for inhibition of seizure activity (positive hits) was determined as a reduction in mean swim velocity of 540%
(red line). Blue data points represent compounds that were classified as toxic as treated larvae have no visible heartbeat or movement in response
to touch after 90-min exposure.

 T
ertiary screening to identify pro-
mising lead compounds for the clinic
Trazodone and lorcaserin, two FDA-approved compounds
with the potential for off-label application in Dravet
syndrome, were screened across a range of concentrations
(10–750 mM) at two time points (30 and 90 min) in the
locomotion assay. Detomidine, a horse tranquilizer with
little translational potential, was not considered further.
Trazodone
was
effective
in
a
concentration-dependent
manner and reached maximal efficacy of �80% reduction
at 250 mM (90 min) and 500 mM (30 mins). Toxicity was
observed at 750 mM (Fig. 6A). Lorcaserin had a maximal
efficacy of �50% reduction of velocity at 10 mM (90 min).
This suppression of seizure behaviour was maintained at
100 and 250 mM (90 mins) and toxicity was observed
above 500 mM (Fig. 6B); 30 min exposure was only effect-
ive at a concentration of 500 mM. Trazodone and lorcaserin
moved on to an additional safety-efficacy test, incorporat-
ing a washout phase, in our microfluidic-based integrated
Zebrafish
Activity
Platform
(iZAP)
monitoring
system
(Hong et al., 2016). Here scn1Lab mutant larvae are
trapped in recording channels and monitored non-inva-
sively using integrated surface electrodes. Baseline seizure
activity was established for mutants simultaneously, then
250 mM trazodone or lorcaserin was perfused into the
microfluidic chambers. Trazodone reduced seizure activity
by 89.0 � 9.1% (n = 5), and treatment with lorcaserin
showed 27.2 � 15.7% suppression (n = 5) during the 2-h
treatment
period.

 during a subsequent washout period (Fig. 7). Mutant larvae
were then released from the iZAP system and observed to
be healthy and freely swimming. As a control experiment,
similar studies were performed with exposure to 250 mM
ethosuximide—an AED not effective in suppressing seizures
associated with Dravet syndrome. No suppression of elec-
trographic seizure activity was noted (4.5 � 3.2 % increase;
n = 6 scn1Lab mutants; Supplementary Fig. 3).
5-HT receptor expression in
zebrafish larvae
As clemizole has significant binding affinity to HTR2A and
HTR2B, and both trazodone and lorcaserin are 5-HT sig-
nalling modulators, we sought to confirm the expression of
these receptors in zebrafish. Protein sequence alignment of
human and zebrafish HTR2 receptors revealed evolutional
conservation with zebrafish orthologues, with Htr2aa and
Htr2ab both exhibiting 59.3% protein identity with the
human HTR2A; and a single HTR2B orthologue, Htr2b
showing 62.0% protein identity. Quantification of htr2 ex-
pression level using isolated heads or tails of 5 dpf wild-
type or scn1Lab mutant larvae revealed enriched htr2a and
htr2cl1 expression in the head. Similar results were ob-
tained from adult wild-type zebrafish brain, as mutant
larvae do not survive to adulthood (Supplementary Fig. 4).

 debilitating outcomes including intractable epilepsy, se-
verely limited cognitive development and risk of SUDEP.
Our preclinical data provide confirmation that modulation
of 5-HT signalling can suppress seizures associated with
SCN1A loss-of-function mutations. Because identified 5-
HT
modulators
are
FDA-approved
compounds
with
known safety profiles, treatment with these repurposed
drugs
could
alter
seizure
frequency
in
children
with
Dravet syndrome. This translational approach targets rare
and devastating diseases for which large-scale clinical trials
are not feasible (Dunoyer, 2011; Parker et al., 2013).
As clemizole is not currently manufactured or available in
clinical grade formulation and trazodone can act as a 5-HT
receptor agonist, or antagonist, depending on concentration
(Maj et al., 1979; Marcoli et al., 1998), we chose to evalu-
ate Belviq� (lorcaserin) under a compassionate use off-label
programme in a small population of children with Dravet
syndrome. These children were shown to be resistant to at
least five approved AEDs. Five children (mean age: 11.8
years; range: 7–18 years) heterozygous for a deletion in
SCN1A were treated prospectively with Belviq� and fol-
lowed longitudinally at the Children’s Hospital Colorado
(Aurora, CO). The treatment protocol was approved by the
Colorado Medical Institutional Review Board (COMIRB),
and parents of Dravet syndrome patients consented in writ-
ing to their child’s participation. We retrospectively re-
viewed the diary-reported number of atonic, myoclonic
and generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures, side effects
and concurrent AEDs.
The clinical characteristics of Dravet syndrome children
treated with Belviq� are summarized in Table 1. There
were no deaths among the five Belviq�-treated patients,
and Belviq� was well tolerated without serious adverse
events
causing
cessation
of
therapy.
During
off-label
Belviq� treatment, one patient was initially seizure-free
for 3 weeks, one patient was seizure-free for 2 weeks,
and a third patient had 1–2 seizure-free days per week.
All five patients exhibited a reduction in the total number
of seizures. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were signifi-
cantly reduced in Patients 1, 2 and 3. Indeed, Patient 2
experienced a 90% reduction in generalized tonic-clonic
seizures with no need for rescue medications. Two patients
remain on Belviq� with no increase in seizure frequency
and, as expected, the most common side effect noted was
a decreased appetite. One patient restarted medication a
second time with interim improvement for a short period
of time and then tapered off.
Discussion
Clemizole, a first-generation antihistamine discovered in the
1950 s (Zierz et al., 1952), was identified as a potential
therapeutic for the treatment of Dravet syndrome using
Figure 7 iZAP EEG measurements of scn1Lab during treatment and washout with trazodone and lorcaserin. (A) Time-domain
and (B) frequency-domain graphs of a representative field potential measured from one 5 dpf scn1Lab mutant treated with 250 mM trazodone. The
inset photograph shows the larva positioned underneath the integrated surface electrodes of the iZAP, the reference electrode, and the trapping
channel. (C) Representative zoomed field potential plots of baseline, trazodone and washing phase. The same data are shown for a representative
individual scn1Lab mutant larva treated with 250 mM lorcaserin. During the 2-h treatment window there was a trend toward decreased efficacy
with prolonged lorcaserin exposure (D–F).

 1952; Jacques et al., 1960) with acute and chronic studies
reporting a low order of toxicity (Finkelstein et al., 1960),
clemizole is no longer manufactured and not currently avail-
able for off-label clinical administration. Lacking a means to
efficiently evaluate clemizole in preclinical rodent models, we
used zebrafish for target engagement (5-HT receptors) and
identification of related drugs (trazodone and lorcaserin)
with appropriate safety profiles facilitating rapid translation
to a clinical application. Compassionate use, off-label pre-
scription of Belviq� (lorcaserin) to medically intractable
Dravet syndrome patients is also described.
Antihistamine H1-receptor antagonists are normally con-
traindicated in paediatric patient populations (Miyata et al.,
2011) and screening these drugs confirmed their inability to
suppress (and in some cases exacerbate) seizures in scn1
zebrafish. Binding data uncovered a previously unknown
clemizole affinity for HTR2A and/or HTR2B receptors. A
subsequent phenotypic screen of targeted libraries identified
two 5-HT-modulating compounds, trazodone and lorca-
serin, capable of suppressing behavioural and electro-
physiological
seizures
in
a
manner
comparable
to
clemizole.
Belviq�
(lorcaserin)
is
an
FDA-approved
HTR2C agonist prescribed for chronic weight management
(Thomsen et al., 2008). Desyrel� (trazodone) is also an
FDA-approved antidepressant commonly prescribed for
sleep disorders (Mendelson, 2005). It is frequently classified
as a HTR2A and HTR2C inverse antagonist and 5-HT
uptake inhibitor (Stahl, 2009). However, studies in rats
suggest trazodone, or its metabolite meta-chlorophenylpi-
perazine (mCPP), can act as a HTR2C agonist at higher
concentrations (Maj et al., 1979; Marcoli et al., 1998).
Notably,
chronic
trazodone
treatment
was
previously
shown to be protective against electroconvulsive induced
seizures in mice (Chavan et al., 2010; Borowicz et al.,
2012), supporting our data from scn1Lab mutant zebrafish.
A 5-HT receptor-mediated action for clemizole is also con-
sistent with a recent phenotypic screen where modulators
of serotonergic signalling (including clemizole) were shown
to be an effective treatment in a preclinical model of
Machado-Joseph disease (Teixeira-Castro et al., 2015);
and studies here suggest that clemizole and trazodone war-
rants further development for off-label testing in patients
with Dravet syndrome.
Our results also add to a growing body of evidence sug-
gesting modulation of serotonergic signalling as a potent
suppressor of seizure activity, especially in catastrophic
childhood epilepsies like Dravet syndrome. Recently, 7 of
10 patients on low-dose treatment with the 5-HT reuptake
blocker fenfluramine were self-reported to be seizure-free
for 1 year (Ceulemans et al., 2016). A slight thickening
of one or two heart valves was reported in two of these
patients consistent with a possible relationship between the
use of fenfluramine and pulmonary hypertension (Douglas
et al., 1981; Ceulemans et al., 2016). In humans, HTR2A
and HTR2C are expressed in the CNS, while HTR2B ex-
pression is enriched in the heart (Lambe et al., 2011;
Meltzer
et
al.,
2013).
More
specifically,
HTR2C
is
expressed on a subpopulation of inhibitory interneurons
(Liu et al., 2007) and activation of these receptors with
5-HT
increases
GABA-mediated
synaptic
inhibition
(Boothman et al., 2006) i.e. the antiepileptic mechanism
of action underlying many commonly prescribed antiepilep-
tic drugs. Indeed, most preclinical studies suggest activation
of HTR2A and/or HTR2C receptors has antiepileptic ef-
fects (Gharedaghi et al., 2014; Guiard et al., 2015),
which is a reasonable mechanism of action linking clemi-
zole, lorcaserin, trazodone, and the 5-HT reuptake blocker
fenfluramine (Dinday et al., 2015; Ceulemans et al., 2016).
Interestingly, htr2b expression in the zebrafish brain was
relatively low, further suggesting that these drugs poten-
tially exert antiepileptic activity via HTR2A or HTR2C
receptor activation. Interestingly, studies in Drosophila
knock-in flies carrying the K1270T SCN1A human muta-
tion in the para sodium channel gene have shown that
supplementation with a 5-HT precursor (5-hydroxytrypto-
phan) rescues the heat induced seizure phenotype (Schutte
et al., 2014). Additionally, a recent study using scn1Lab
mutants evaluated 13 5-HT signalling compounds and
also suggested a potential antiepileptic role for modulators
of 5-HT signalling (Sourbron et al., 2016). However, these
latter zebrafish studies used a fundamentally different
protocol (24 h versus 30–90 min drug exposure) not previ-
ously validated as successfully identifying AEDs used in
Dravet syndrome (benzodiazepines, valproate, stiripentol,
bromides, and ketogenic diet). Additionally, drug concen-
trations some 10-fold lower than we demonstrate to be
effective in zebrafish (Baraban et al., 2005, 2013; Dinday
et al., 2015), and reporting an antiepileptic action for the
hallucinogen TCB-2 (Fig. 5), suggests that direct compari-
son of data from laboratories using different procedures
should be interpreted with caution.
Overall, we conclude that mutant zebrafish are a suitable
model for the rapid screening and discovery of novel AEDs
that, with appropriate safety profiles, can directly inform
clinical care for at risk patient populations such as Dravet
syndrome.
