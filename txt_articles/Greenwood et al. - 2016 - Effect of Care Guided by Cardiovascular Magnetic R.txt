IMPORTANCE Among patients with suspected coronary heart disease (CHD), rates of invasive
angiography are considered too high.
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that among patients with suspected CHD, cardiovascular
magnetic resonance (CMR)–guided care is superior to National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) guidelines–directed care and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy
(MPS)–guided care in reducing unnecessary angiography.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, 3-parallel group, randomized clinical trial
using a pragmatic comparative effectiveness design. From 6 UK hospitals, 1202 symptomatic
patients with suspected CHD and a CHD pretest likelihood of 10% to 90% were recruited.
First randomization was November 23, 2012; last 12-month follow-up was March 12, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned (240:481:481) to management according
to UK NICE guidelines or to guided care based on the results of CMR or MPS testing.

RESULTS Among 1202 symptomatic patients (mean age, 56.3 years [SD, 9.0]; women, 564
[46.9%] ; mean CHD pretest likelihood, 49.5% [SD, 23.8%]), number of patients with invasive
coronary angiography after 12 months was 102 in the NICE guidelines group (42.5% [95% CI,
36.2%-49.0%])], 85 in the CMR group (17.7% [95% CI, 14.4%-21.4%]); and 78 in the MPS
group (16.2% [95% CI, 13.0%-19.8%]). Study-defined unnecessary angiography occurred in
69 (28.8%) in the NICE guidelines group, 36 (7.5%) in the CMR group, and 34 (7.1%) in the
MPS group; adjusted odds ratio of unnecessary angiography: CMR group vs NICE guidelines
group, 0.21 (95% CI, 0.12-0.34, P < .001); CMR group vs the MPS group, 1.27 (95% CI, 0.79-
2.03, P = .32). Positive angiography proportions were 12.1% (95% CI, 8.2%-16.9%; 29/240
patients) for the NICE guidelines group, 9.8% (95% CI, 7.3%-12.8%; 47/481 patients) for the
CMR group, and 8.7% (95% CI, 6.4%-11.6%; 42/481 patients) for the MPS group. A MACE was
reported at a minimum of 12 months in 1.7% of patients in the NICE guidelines group, 2.5% in
the CMR group, and 2.5% in the MPS group (adjusted hazard ratios: CMR group vs NICE
guidelines group, 1.37 [95% CI, 0.52-3.57]; CMR group vs MPS group, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.46-1.95]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with suspected angina, investigation by CMR
resulted in a lower probability of unnecessary angiography within 12 months than NICE
guideline–directed care, with no statistically significant difference between CMR and MPS
strategies. There were no statistically significant differences in MACE rates.

C
oronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of
death and disability worldwide. Several methods are
available to diagnose CHD, risk-stratify patients,
and determine the need for revascularization. Myocardial
perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) by single-photon emis-
sion computed tomogra-
phyisthemostcommonly
used test worldwide for
the assessment of myo-
cardial ischemia, with
robust evidence support-
ing its prognostic value.
However, cardiovascu-
lar magnetic resonance
(CMR) is increasingly
recognized as having high diagnostic accuracy and prognos-
tic value.1,2
Despite the widespread availability and recommenda-
tions for noninvasive imaging in international guidelines,3-5
invasive coronary angiography is commonly used early in
diagnostic pathways in patients with suspected CHD. Evi-
dence from large populations presenting with chest pain has
confirmed that the majority will not have significant
obstructive coronary disease6,7; a large US study reported
that approximately 60% of elective cardiac catheterizations
found no obstructive CHD.8 Thus, avoiding unnecessary
angiography should reduce patient risk and provide signifi-
cant financial savings.
Currentguidelinesforinvestigationofstablechestpainad-
vocate management based on the pretest likelihood of CHD.3-5
However,pretestlikelihoodmodelscanoverestimateCHDrisk,
therefore paradoxically increasing the probability of invasive
coronary angiography.9 To date, there are no large-scale com-
parative effectiveness trials of different functional imaging
strategies recommended by current guidelines.
The Clinical Evaluation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in
Coronary Heart Disease 2 (CE-MARC 2) trial was designed to
test the hypothesis that in patients with suspected CHD, CMR-
guided care is superior to national guidelines–directed care4
and MPS-guided care10 in reducing the occurrence of unnec-
essary invasive angiography within 12 months.
Methods
Trial Design
CE-MARC 2 was a multicenter, 3-parallel group, randomized
clinical trial. It used a pragmatic comparative effectiveness
design11 to determine the efficacy and safety of 3 strategies
(CMR-guided care, MPS-guided care [following American Col-
lege of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Associa-
tion appropriate use criteria],10 and UK National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence [NICE] guidelines [CG95]4) for in-
vestigating patients with suspected CHD. The study was con-
ducted in accordance with the protocol (available with the sta-
tistical analysis plan in Supplement 1), which was approved by
the UK National Research Ethics Service (12/YH/0404) and in-
stitutional review boards of the participating centers. Study
conduct was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki;
all patients provided written informed consent.
Trial Population
Patients with suspected angina pectoris were eligible if they
were 30 years or older, had a CHD pretest likelihood of 10% to
90%,4,12 and were suitable for revascularization. Exclusion cri-
teria included nonanginal chest pain, a normal MPS or car-
diac computed tomography (CCT) result within the previous
2 years, being clinically unstable, previous myocardial infarc-
tion, previous coronary revascularization, and contraindica-
tion to any study noninvasive imaging test (eTable 4 in
Supplement 2).11 Self-reported race/ethnicity was collected
using Office for National Statistics fixed categories.13
Randomization
Patients were assigned using minimization, incorporating a
random element and 1:2:2 allocation ratio14 through an auto-
mated 24-hour secure-access telephone service by the Clini-
cal Trials Unit. Allocation was to 1 of 5 equally sized groups
(A:B:C:D:E, stratifying on center, age [30-64 years and ≥65
years], CHD pretest likelihood [10%-29%, 30%-60%, 61%-
90%], and sex) following whether management was by NICE
guidelines–directed care (NICE guidelines group; group A)
CMR-guided care (CMR group; groups B or C) or MPS-guided
care (MPS group; groups D or E). Patients randomized to the
NICE guidelines group were scheduled for CCT for patients
with a pretest likelihood of 10% to 29%, MPS for patients
with a pretest likelihood of 30% to 60% or sent directly to
coronary angiography for patients with CHD pretest likeli-
hoods of 61% to 90%.
Diagnostic Testing
All investigations were performed and interpreted by certified
local physicians using protocols conforming to international
standards.15-18 Quality assurance was undertaken centrally
throughout the trial by blinded, independent, modality-
specific imaging experts (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). Ten
percent of scans for each modality at each recruiting center
Key Points
Question In patients with suspected coronary heart disease, does
a strategy involving cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
result in less unnecessary angiography than a myocardial perfusion
scintigraphy (MPS) strategy or a national guideline that included
sending high-risk patients directly to angiography?
Findings In this clinical trial, both CMR and MPS strategies
significantly reduced unnecessary angiography rates compared
with national guidelines (7.5% for CMR, 7.1% for MPS, 28.8% for
national guidelines); no statistically significant differences were
seen between CMR and MPS strategies. There was no statistically
significant difference in major cardiovascular event rates at 12
months between the 3 groups.
Meaning Noninvasive functional imaging strategies reduced
unnecessary angiography compared with guidelines-directed care.

Detailedprotocolsforeachimagingmodalityandcriteriaforre-
porting a positive result have been published11; a positive scan

nary angiography and fractional flow reserve (FFR)
measurement.11FFRmeasurement(PressureWire,StJudeMedi-
cal) was performed in all coronary vessels of 2.5 mm diameter
or more with a 40% to 90% stenosis.11 When FFR measure-
ment was not possible for clinical or safety reasons, quantita-
tive coronary angiography (QCA) was performed. All FFR and
QCA results were analyzed at the Glasgow Angiographic Core
Laboratory by a single, independent, blinded observer. Posi-
tive angiography was defined as any lesion with an FFR value
of0.8orless,or,ifFFRmeasurementwasnotperformed,aper-
centage diameter stenosis of 70% or higher in 1 view or 50% or
higher in 2 orthogonal views.
End Points
Theprimaryendpointwasprotocol-definedunnecessarycoro-
naryangiographyoccurringwithin12months,definedbyanor-
mal FFR value (or QCA) in all vessels 2.5 mm or more in diam-
eter. By design, this included any unnecessary angiography
occurring after a false-positive test result, patients with high
CHD pretest likelihood sent directly to coronary angiography
(NICE guidelines group only), and imaging results that were
either inconclusive or negative but overruled by the respon-
sible physician.11 Secondary end points included a composite
of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs: cardiovascu-
lar death, myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary revas-
cularization, and hospital admission for cardiovascular cause),
and positive angiography rates (recommended by the inde-
pendent data monitoring and ethics committee). Complica-
tions directly related to trial investigations resulting in pro-
longed hospital stay or specific treatment were prespecified
as safety secondary end points. Quality-of-life outcomes and
cost-effectiveness analyses will be reported subsequently.
Trial Oversight
Anindependentdatamonitoringandethicscommitteeandtrial
steering committee assessed study conduct, integrity, and
safety every 6 months (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Statistical Analysis
Allowing for 20% noncompletion, 1200 patients would pro-
vide the study with 99% power to detect a difference in un-
necessary angiography between CMR-guided care and NICE
guidelines–directed care (using 2:1 allocation), and 94% power
between CMR-guided and MPS-guided care based on pro-
jected unnecessary angiography proportions of 4.5% for the
CMR group, 11.7% for the MPS group, and 30% for the NICE
guidelines group (2-sided, 5% significance for continuity-
corrected χ2 test).19
Logistic regressions were used to model odds of an unnec-
essary angiogram for CMR-guided management vs both
NICE- and MPS-guided management, including stratification
factors (treating centers as fixed effects). Analyses used
intention-to-treat populations and were repeated in per-
protocol populations. Multiple imputation (by fully condi-
tionalspecification)wasusedformissingbaseline,test,andend
point data to ensure all participants could be included in the
analysis,andavoidtreatingunknownvaluesascertainlyknown
(eg, with mean imputation and no-event imputation).20 Ten

portionofpatientswithanymissingdatawaslessthan10%,and
primary end point analyses on each data set were combined to

The proportion of patients in each group with a MACE at 12
months and absolute differences in MACE rates were calcu-
lated. Confidence intervals for proportions and their differ-
enceswerecalculatedbyexactmethods.TimetofirstMACEwas
modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression, including
stratificationandotherprespecifiedfactors(hypertension,eth-
nicity, smoking, and diabetes) and illustrated using Kaplan-
Meier estimates. CMR and MPS groups were combined into a
single “functional imaging” group to compare unnecessary an-
giography vs NICE guidelines–directed care in the 61% to 90%
and 10% to 29% CHD pretest likelihood subgroups. Subgroup
analyses were undertaken by including interaction effects
in regression models. Statistical tests were 2-sided and called
significant at the 5% level. Analyses used SAS (SAS Institute),
version 9.4, after all randomized patients had completed the
12-month follow-up; there were no interim analyses.
Results
Trial Population
Between November 23, 2012, and March 13, 2015, 13 957 pa-
tients were screened, of whom 2205 were eligible (Figure 1 lists
reasons for noneligibility and nonconsent). From 6 UK cen-
ters (Leeds, Glasgow, Leicester, Bristol, Oxford, London
[StGeorges]),1202patients(55%ofeligible)wererecruitedand
allocated to NICE guidelines–directed care (n = 240) or man-
agement by CMR (n = 481) or MPS (n = 481) (Figure 1).
Baseline Characteristics
The mean age of patients was 56.3 years (SD, 9.0), 638 pa-
tients (53%) were men, the mean body mass index (BMI; cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared) was 29.1 (SD, 5.2), and 1107 patients (92%) were clas-
sified ethnically as white (Table 1). The study population had
a substantial burden of cardiovascular risk factors: 150 pa-
tients (12.5%) had diabetes, 458 patients (38.1%) had hyper-
tension, 702 patients (58.4%) were past or current tobacco us-
ers, 483 patients (40.2%) had dyslipidemia, and 651 patients
(54.2%) had a family history of premature CHD. Patients had
a median of 2 of these 5 risk factors. All patients were symp-
tomatic, with 401 patients (33.4%) reporting typical chest pain
and 801 patients (66.6%) reporting atypical chest pain as their
primary symptom. The assessment of cardiac risk, calculated
according to the 2013 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
risk score from the American College of Cardiology Founda-
tionandAmericanHeartAssociationguidelines,22showedthat
441 of 923 patients (47.8%) had a 10-year risk of events of 7.5%
or higher. The mean pretest likelihood of obstructive CHD ac-
cording to the Duke score was 49.5% (SD, 23.8%).12

assigned to the MPS group, 446 patients (92.7%) had MPS as
the initial test (median time from randomization, 28 days
[interquartile range, 22-39]), 4 patients (0.8%) had CMR, 5
patients (1.0%) went directly to angiography, and 21 patients
(4.4%) had no test. Of 240 patients assigned to the NICE
guidelines group, 56 patients (23.3%) had CCT (median time
from randomization, 34 days [interquartile range, 14-44]),
86 patients (35.8%) had MPS, 85 patients (35.4%) went
directly to angiography, and 11 patients (4.6%) had no test.
The numbers of patients adherent to receiving both their
initial randomized test and per-protocol compliance with
their test result were 200 patients (83.3%) in the NICE
guidelines group, 414 patients (86.1%) in the CMR group,
and 368 patients (76.5%) in the MPS group.
Study sites reported their interpretation of the initial test
as positive for CHD in 54 of 435 patients (12.4%) in the CMR
group, in 81 of 446 patients (18.2%) in the MPS group, and in
19 of 142 patients (13.4%) in the NICE guidelines group. There
was no difference in revascularization rates (Figure 1) be-
tween the 3 groups (P = .47). The rate of patients with incom-
plete data required for analysis of the primary end point was
low: 18 of 240 patients (7.5%) in the NICE guidelines group,
50 of 481 patients (10.4%) in the CMR group, and 33 of 481 pa-
tients (6.9%) in the MPS group. Of these, 11 of 240 patients
(4.6%) in the NICE guidelines group, 23 of 481 patients (4.8%)
in the CMR group, and 21 of 481 patients (4.4%) in the MPS
group were related to missing test results.
Primary End Point
Overall, 265 patients (22.0%) underwent at least 1 coronary an-
giogram (10 patients underwent 2 angiograms) within 12
months of randomization: 102 of 240 patients (42.5%) in the
NICE guidelines group, 85 of 481 patients (17.7%) in the CMR
group, and 78 of 481 patients (16.2%) in the MPS group. The
primary end point of unnecessary angiography occurred in 69
patients (28.8%) in the NICE guidelines group, 36 patients
(7.5%) in the CMR group, and 34 patients (7.1%) in the MPS
group. Of these angiograms, 98 angiograms (70.5%) had no vi-
sual stenosis and were not assessed further, 40 angiograms
(28.8%) reached the conclusion by FFR measurement and 1 an-
giogram (0.7%) involved QCA only. The adjusted odds ratio of
unnecessary angiography for the CMR group vs the NICE

Secondary End Points
Positive angiography was observed in 29 patients (12.1%
[95% CI, 8.2%-16.9%]) in the NICE guidelines group, 47
patients (9.8% [95% CI, 7.3%-12.8%]) in the CMR group, and
42 patients (8.7% [95% CI, 6.4%-11.6%) in the MPS group
(P = .36). During the minimum 1-year follow-up (median,
15.8 months [interquartile range, 12.1-24.2]), 36 patients
(3.0%) had at least 1 MACE: NICE guidelines group, 6
patients (2.5%); CMR group, 15 patients (3.1%); MPS group,
15 patients (3.1%) (Table 2). Annualized MACE rates were
1.6% for the NICE guidelines group, 2.0% for the CMR
group, and 2.0% for the MPS group. Adjusted hazard ratios
for MACE were 1.37 (95% CI, 0.52-3.57; P = .52) for the CMR
group vs the NICE guidelines group and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.46-
1.95; P = .88) for the CMR group vs the MPS group. Hard

the MPS group (P = .93). Figure 3 shows the Kaplan-Meier
cumulative incidence estimate of first MACE. In the study,
5 test-related medical complications were reported: CMR
(1 case: mild urticarial reaction), MPS (0 cases), CCT (1 case:
vasovagal episode), and angiography (3 cases: ventricular
tachycardia, pseudo-aneurysm and popliteal deep venous
thrombosis, right coronary artery spasm and transient ST
elevation).
Functional Imaging Assessment
Using functional imaging as a first-line strategy (CMR or MPS)
in patients with a 61% to 90% (high; n = 389) CHD pretest like-
lihood resulted in substantially reduced odds of unnecessary
angiography compared with the NICE guidelines group; 29 of
307 patients (9.4%) for functional imaging groups vs 51 of 82
patients (62.2%) for the NICE guidelines group, odds ratio (OR)
0.048 (95% CI, 0.02-0.10), P < .001. Among those with less
than 30% (low; n = 330) CHD pretest likelihood, the odds of
unnecessary angiography were also numerically lower by a
functional imaging approach compared with anatomical (CCT)
assessment (13 of 269 patients (4.8%) for funtional imaging vs
7 of 61 patients (11.5%) for anatomical assessment; OR, 0.44
[95% CI, 0.17-1.17]; P = .099).
Discussion
CE-MARC 2 was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial in a
large community-based population of symptomatic patients
undergoing assessment for suspected CHD, in whom further
investigation was appropriate according to international
guidelines. A CMR-guided strategy significantly reduced
unnecessary angiography occurrence compared with NICE
guidelines-guided care, but was not significantly different
from an MPS-guided strategy (following US appropriate use
criteria).10 Between the 3 strategies, there was no difference
in MACE rates at 12 months or disease detection (positive
angiography) rates.
There is concern that coronary angiography is overused in
the diagnostic pathway of suspected CHD and that the major-
ity of patients investigated will not have significant obstruc-
tive coronary disease.6,7 Avoiding unnecessary invasive angi-
ography could have significant financial benefits, avoids
exposing patients to unnecessary risk, and is also a strong pa-
tient desire.23 For this reason, this outcome was chosen as the
patient-focused primary end point.
Current international guidelines for investigation and
management of suspected CHD all suggest risk stratification
based on pretest likelihood estimation.12,24,25 The Duke
score, used in NICE guidelines, is based upon the original
Diamond Forrester model, but includes additional demo-
graphic factors to further stratify risk.12 These models,
derived more than 3 decades ago, tend to overestimate CHD
risk because patient demographics, risk factors, and treat-
ment have changed considerably over time.26 In the
CE-MARC 2 trial, the reduction in unnecessary angiography
by a CMR or MPS strategy appears largely driven by the
overestimation of disease probability from using the Duke
score. Current NICE guidelines categorize a pretest likeli-
hood of 60% to 90% as being at high-risk of CHD, and rec-
ommend direct referral for angiography. In the CE-MARC 2
trial, this explained the majority of patients in the NICE-
guidelines group who got referred for angiography (82 of
102 patients; 80.4%), and the majority of unnecessary
angiograms (59 of 69 patients; 85.5%). This was further
emphasized by the preplanned, subanalysis of any func-
tional imaging (CMR or MPS) in the 60% to 90% (high risk)
pretest likelihood population, which showed substantially
reduced odds of unnecessary angiography in this combined
subgroup compared with the NICE guideline group.
Overall, rates of disease detection (positive angiogra-
phy) were comparable for the 3 strategies, suggesting no
penalty for using functional imaging as a gatekeeper for
angiography, even in high-risk subgroups. Consistent with
published studies, the CE-MARC 2 trial showed a low overall
rate of MACE in a stable chest pain population, with no early
difference between strategies.
It remains a point of debate as to whether all of protocol-
defined unnecessary angiograms in this study were clinically
unnecessary; some would argue that negative tests are the
“price to pay” for not missing important disease in others. This
assumes a population perspective, and our trial primary end
pointwasderivedaftercloseconsultationwithpatientandpub-
lic representatives: from an individual patient perspective, an
angiogram that does not change their treatment or their clini-
cal outcome is considered by patients to have been unneces-
sary. Guidelines are clear that physicians do not need to un-

dertake angiography to either diagnose angina or offer primary
prevention and symptom control.
To our knowledge, there have been no randomized clini-
cal trials comparing the performance of current management
guidelines and a broad functional imaging approach in terms
of important clinical end points. Although cross-sectional
imaging (CMR and CCT) has improved diagnostic ability, ben-
efits in terms of health outcomes are more difficult to demon-
strate, partly due to complexity of subsequent treatment ef-
fects. Functional vs anatomical assessment as a potential
gatekeeper to the catheterization laboratory is a topic of on-
going debate.27,28 The Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study
for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial showed no im-
provement in clinical outcomes using CCT vs a variety of func-
tionaltestsinpatientsinvestigatedforsuspectedCHD;whereas
the CCT strategy increased rates of cardiac catheterization
(12.2% for CCT vs 8.1% for a variety of functional tests, P = .02)
and 90 day coronary revascularization (6.2% for CCT vs 3.2%
for a variety of functional tests, P < .001).27 This may be im-
portant following a recent observational study of 544 US cen-
ters showing higher rates of inappropriate percutaneous coro-
nary intervention at sites performing the highest rates of
angiography, suggesting anatomical assessment could predis-
posepatientstounnecessarytherapy.29Althoughnumbersare
small, in the CE-MARC 2 trial an increased rate of unnecessary
angiographywassuggestedinthelow-risksubgroupoftheNICE
guidelines group, the majority of whom underwent CCT.
Limitations
This study has several important limitations. First, the false-
positive and false-negative rates are often quantities of inter-
estinevaluatingdiagnosticmethods.TheCE-MARC2trialonly
angiographically verified a subset of patients, contingent on
strategy findings, and so cannot provide accurate estimates.
TheoriginalCE-MARCtrialdefinedthefalse-positiveandfalse-
negative rates for CMR and MPS, and showed CMR-guided
strategy as being superior to the MPS-guided strategy.1 In the
current study, there was no statistical difference between the
CMR and MPS strategies for reduction in unnecessary angiog-
raphy, despite the finding from the CE-MARC trial. However,
the CE-MARC trial was able to detect small differences due to
its paired design (all patients underwent all tests), whereas the
current study compared independent groups, which confers
lower power.
Second, the study population was predominantly white
northern European, therefore findings may not translate to
other populations; geographic heterogeneity of CHD inci-
dence is well known.25
Third, at trial initiation, contemporary guidelines used the
Duke score,3,4 with the NICE guidelines classifying high risk
for CHD as 60% to 90% pretest likelihood. It is now recog-
nized that this may overestimate CHD risk, such that recent
guidelines5 have adopted a recalibrated risk model.25
Fourth, the primary end point was objective (using FFR
measurement), although performance was not clinically pos-
sible in all cases; blinded core laboratory analysis of QCA data
avoided subjective visual angiography interpretation.
Fifth, overall full adherence to the protocol was high, with
some unavoidable variation due to individual clinical prac-
tice, which could have introduced bias (eg, abnormal imaging
results not proceeding to angiography). To mitigate this, analy-
sis was by intention-to-treat principles and the primary end
point was purposely all inclusive (ie, false-positives, true-
negatives when not believed by clinicians, and also test fail-
ures). The slightly different rates of incomplete data (not sta-
tisticallysignificant)betweenstudygroupswasnotofconcern,
as the data completeness rate was high overall. Per-protocol
and sensitivity analyses (eTable 5 in Supplement 2) did not al-
ter the trial conclusions.
Sixth, although clinically robust, a MACE is not a proxy
for a missed diagnosis or treatment (eg, missed opportunity
for revascularization by not having angiography [due to a
false-negative result]). However, it remains debatable
whether revascularization for stable angina has prognostic
benefit over optimal medical therapy, which will be
answered by the ongoing International Study of Compara-
tive Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive
Approaches (ISCHEMIA) trial.30
Seventh,qualityoflifeandcost-effectivenessanalyseswill
be important for understanding the patient-centered perspec-
tivesandpayer/policyimplicationsofthesefindings;thesedata
are currently being collected and analyzed.
Conclusions
In patients with suspected angina, investigation by CMR re-
sultedinalowerprobabilityofunnecessaryangiographywithin
12 months than NICE guideline–directed care, with no statis-
tically significant difference between CMR and MPS strate-
gies.TherewerenostatisticallysignificantdifferencesinMACE
