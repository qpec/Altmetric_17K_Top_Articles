ABSTRACT
The hospital environment is a potential reservoir of bacteria with plasmids
conferring carbapenem resistance. Our Hospital Epidemiology Service routinely performs
extensive sampling of high-touch surfaces, sinks, and other locations in the hospital.
Over a 2-year period, additional sampling was conducted at a broader range of loca-
tions, including housekeeping closets, wastewater from hospital internal pipes, and ex-
ternal manholes. We compared these data with previously collected information from 5
years of patient clinical and surveillance isolates. Whole-genome sequencing and analy-
sis of 108 isolates provided comprehensive characterization of blaKPC/blaNDM-positive iso-
lates, enabling an in-depth genetic comparison. Strikingly, despite a very low prevalence
of patient infections with blaKPC-positive organisms, all samples from the intensive care
unit pipe wastewater and external manholes contained carbapenemase-producing or-
ganisms (CPOs), suggesting a vast, resilient reservoir. We observed a diverse set of spe-
cies and plasmids, and we noted species and susceptibility profile differences between
environmental and patient populations of CPOs. However, there were plasmid back-
bones common to both populations, highlighting a potential environmental reservoir of
mobile elements that may contribute to the spread of resistance genes. Clear associa-
tions between patient and environmental isolates were uncommon based on sequence
analysis and epidemiology, suggesting reasonable infection control compliance at our
institution. Nonetheless, a probable nosocomial transmission of Leclercia sp. from the
housekeeping environment to a patient was detected by this extensive surveillance.
These data and analyses further our understanding of CPOs in the hospital environment
and are broadly relevant to the design of infection control strategies in many infrastruc-
ture settings.
IMPORTANCE
Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) are a global concern
because of the morbidity and mortality associated with these resistant Gram-
negative bacteria. Horizontal plasmid transfer spreads the resistance mechanism to
new bacteria, and understanding the plasmid ecology of the hospital environment
can assist in the design of control strategies to prevent nosocomial infections. A
5-year genomic and epidemiological survey was undertaken to study the CPOs in
the patient-accessible environment, as well as in the plumbing system removed
from the patient. This comprehensive survey revealed a vast, unappreciated reservoir
of CPOs in wastewater, which was in contrast to the low positivity rate in both the
patient population and the patient-accessible environment. While there were few
patient-environmental isolate associations, there were plasmid backbones common
to both populations. These results are relevant to all hospitals for which CPO coloni-
zation may not yet be defined through extensive surveillance.

T
he Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that nearly 4% of the
patients in acute-care hospitals in 2011 had contracted a hospital-acquired infec-
tion (HAI), with a projected estimate of 648,000 patients having had at least one HAI
in United States acute-care hospitals in 2011 (1). HAIs caused by carbapenemase-
producing organisms (CPOs) are of particular concern because of the substantial rates
of morbidity and mortality associated with these infections (2). Carbapenemases are
beta-lactamase enzymes (bla) that hydrolyze carbapenems, a family of antimicrobials
considered to be a last line of defense against infections caused by multidrug-resistant
organisms (MDROs). The most commonly detected carbapenemases in the United
States include blaKPC, blaNDM, and blaOXA (3). In 2011, the NIH Clinical Center (NIHCC)
experienced an outbreak of blaKPC-positive (blaKPC�) Klebsiella pneumoniae that ulti-
mately affected 19 patients. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to track the
outbreak and elucidate the chain of transmission from the index patient (4). During the
2011-2012 investigation, blaKPC� K. pneumoniae was also cultured from a handrail, a
ventilator, sink drains, and surfaces within a patient’
s room (4, 5). Since then, extensive
routine perirectal surveillance of all high-risk patients has been performed, along with
environmental sampling throughout the hospital. All blaKPC/blaNDM PCR-positive envi-
ronmental and newly identified clinical and/or patient surveillance isolates have been
sequenced for both epidemiological and research purposes. The NIHCC has a very low
prevalence of blaKPC, blaNDM, and blaOXA CPOs (0.35% of patients for perirectal surveil-
lance and 0.14% of patients for clinical cultures between 2012 and 2016), with the
majority of CPO-colonized patients detected by culture-based screening at the time of
admission. Notably, we have identified very few blaOXA� isolates; therefore, our focus
for environmental screening was on CPOs that were blaKPC� or blaNDM� by PCR.
Environmental surveillance can be a useful tool to identify the source of an outbreak
(6), to better understand the microbial communities within the hospital (7), and to
evaluate the efficacy of environmental disinfection or other infection control measures
(8). Sources of outbreaks are occasionally linked to aqueous locations such as sinks and
drains (9–12), where the presence of biofilms makes remediation challenging; sink
engineering modifications have been proposed to tackle these problems (13, 14).
Beyond the sink, hospital sewage and wastewater are known reservoirs of CPOs around
the world (15–20). One hypothesis suggests that this reservoir is, in part, due to the use
of large quantities of antimicrobial agents in hospitals, which leads to the selection of
MDROs and the high likelihood of horizontal gene transfer within the hospital effluent
(21). A number of previous surveillance and outbreak studies have focused either
on hospital effluent and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (19, 22–24) or on the
internal hospital environment only (25). Those studies used PCR, pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE), and culture methods to track organisms and antimicrobial
resistance genes. WGS was often performed only on a small number of isolates and
plasmids in these studies (18, 26, 27), limiting the genomic resolution of the analysis.
Additionally, there have been limited studies comparing wastewater MDROs with
patient isolates (18, 28–31).
To conduct a more in-depth analysis, we investigated the NIHCC environment to (i)
determine if additional potential reservoirs of CPOs might provide information to
improve our surveillance strategies, (ii) characterize similarities between chromosomes
and plasmids of environmental and patient CPOs, and (iii) improve our understanding
of the microbial and genetic diversity associated with carbapenemases in the health
care environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a
combined genomic analysis of blaKPC/blaNDM-positive isolates from patients, from the
accessible environment within the hospital, and from the external hospital effluent.

multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in the environment and hospital settings.
RESULTS
CPOs detected in the hospital environment. Extensive surveillance of the envi-
ronment (Table 1), perirectal surveillance of high-risk patients upon hospital admission,
and monthly whole-house surveillance of all in-house patients are performed at the
NIHCC to monitor proactively and to enable an immediate response to the presence of
CPOs. The Hospital Epidemiology Service focuses on surfaces accessible to patients and
health care providers, particularly sink-related locations and high-touch surfaces such
as countertops, handrails, furniture, patient equipment, doorknobs, carts, computers,
keyboards, phones, handles, nursing stations, break rooms, ice machines, wheelchairs,
elevators, and waiting areas. CPOs were recovered from only 3 (1.4%) of the 217
samples taken from high-touch surfaces over a 5-year period. One isolate was K. pneu-
moniae (KPNIH26) from a handrail that was sampled during the outbreak investigation,
and the remaining two isolates were blaKPC� Pantoea spp. (PSNIH1 and PSNIH2)
cultured from a shelf in an inpatient ward medication storage room and from the
handrail of a public staircase, respectively (5). A large number of samples were also
collected from sink components, including drains, traps, aerators, and faucets, as well
as tap water. Aerators were removed, resuspended in broth prior to culture, and
replaced with new parts. No potable water samples or faucet swabs grew CPOs, but 11
(3.2%) of the 340 samples from 10 drains and one aerator culture contained CPOs.
Surfaces to which patients do not have direct access also contained CPOs, including
12% of the samples collected from locked housekeeping storage closets (equipment
and floor drains) (Table 1).
CPOs detected in wastewater. All seven wastewater samples (100%) collected
from the intensive care unit (ICU) piping system contained at least one CPO, a
remarkable finding given the low prevalence of CPOs in our patient population. No
CPOs were detected from two wastewater collections obtained from a different non-
ICU floor of the hospital. Additionally, seven wastewater samples were collected from
two external manholes associated with the NIHCC, and CPOs were recovered from
every sample collected. The wastewater pipe system appears to be a reservoir for CPOs,
even though our data indicate infrequent input of new CPOs on the basis of surveil-
lance testing of all hospitalized patients and a recent point prevalence survey that did
not find carriage of MDROs in the intestinal flora of NIHCC health care personnel (32).
Distinct characteristics observed in CPOs from environmental and patient
samples. The 72 CPOs from the environment were compared with 36 CPOs from 30

 patients (Fig. 1), as some patients were colonized with more than 1 CPO. A number of
environmental CPO species identified in the wastewater areas were not observed in our
patient population, including Serratia spp. (not Serratia marcescens) in the wastewater
and an Escherichia sp. (not Escherichia coli) found in the housekeeping closet floor
drains (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Diverse blaKPC� Aeromonas spp. were
abundant in our environmental sampling, but only one blaKPC� Aeromonas sp.
(AHNIH1), which was genetically unrelated to the environmental Aeromonas spp., has
been detected in a single NIHCC patient to date (33). Surprisingly, no species desig-
nation could be assigned to three environmental Enterobacteriaceae isolates by using
three clinically relevant platforms (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of
flight mass spectrometry [MALDI-TOF MS], 16S rRNA sequencing, and WGS), highlight-
ing carbapenemase genes in uniquely environmental species. The minute volume of
wastewater collected for culture compared to the amount within the hospital effluent
provided only a narrow representation of the vast wastewater reservoir; thus, the
observed diversity of CPOs in the hospital effluent may be much greater than that
shown by our data. In contrast to the environmental samples discussed above, com-
monality was observed between CPO species from sink drains and patients, including
the Enterobacter cloacae complex, the Citrobacter freundii complex, and Klebsiella
oxytoca.

 Susceptibility profiles of environmental and patient carbapenemase-producing
members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were compared (Fig. 2; Table S1). Overall,
Enterobacteriaceae environmental isolates were more susceptible to meropenem, cip-
rofloxacin, amikacin, and tobramycin than were patient isolates (Fig. 2). Additionally, all
of the environmental Aeromonas spp. were susceptible to meropenem and imipenem
(Table S1). Four environmental Enterobacteriaceae isolates were excluded from this
specific comparison because we limited the study set to avoid collection bias that
might inaccurately show more sensitivity of environmental isolates. Isolates that did not
demonstrate growth on HardyCHROM CRE (CRE medium; Hardy Diagnostics) after
original recovery from less selective HardyCHROM ESBL (ESBL medium; Hardy Diagnos-
tics) and R2A medium were excluded because CRE medium is used for patient surveil-
lance. Patient isolates recovered on a number of clinical culture media were included.
Potential associations between patient and environmental isolates were iden-
tified. Comparison of the genomes of 36 patient isolates and 72 environmental
isolates revealed eight instances in which patient isolates showed �99.90% average
nucleotide identity (ANI) with environmental isolates (Fig. 1). One E. cloacae complex
strain (ECNIH7) from patient P, who had been hospitalized earlier in the ICU, had
�99.96% ANI with two E. cloacae complex isolates from ICU wastewater. No other
patient isolates matched any other CPOs from ICU pipe or manhole wastewater. The
remaining seven patient isolates showed �99.90% ANI with isolates from sinks, house-
keeping closets, and high-touch surfaces. One patient isolate (KPNIH24) showed high
identity with two environmental isolates; however, this may be a widely distributed
strain with little divergence since genomes with �100 single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) have been identified at several institutions, based upon sequence data
available in public databases. Moreover, the epidemiological link is weak, with a 3-year
gap between this patient’
s hospitalization and detection in housekeeping areas (Fig. 1).
Pantoea spp. are known organisms in hospital environments and can be associated
with outbreaks (34, 35). In 2015, two patients were found to be colonized with blaKPC�
Pantoea spp., but epidemiology and genomic data indicated that they were not clonal;
PSNIH3 and PSNIH6 showed �90% ANI. The positive surveillance data led to an
investigation that identified two environmental Pantoea spp. (PSNIH4 and PSNIH5)
associated with housekeeping equipment. These two environmental isolates, along
with Pantoea PSNIH2 isolated from handrails in 2013 (5), showed �99.95% ANI with

 patient isolate PSNIH3 (Fig. 1). SNP analysis identified �119 different SNPs between the
patient strain and three environmental strains, which suggested closely related, but not
clonal, strains. These findings emphasize the ability of Pantoea spp. to survive on
different hospital environmental surfaces, as previously reported (5, 34).
Sink drains are a known reservoir of CPOs (9–11). We detected three examples of
patient isolates showing �99.90% ANI with sink drain isolates (Fig. 1). E. cloacae
complex isolate ECNIH6, detected in a patient in 2014, showed �99.95% ANI with three
sink isolates (ECNIH4, ECNIH9, and ECNIH10) recovered from two different rooms in
2012; however, the patient was never housed in either room. Another common species
identified in the sink cultures, K. oxytoca, has been implicated in biofilm-associated sink
contamination in other hospitals (10, 11). K. oxytoca sink drain isolates (KONIH5 and
KONIH6) were cultured from two sink drains in a room that housed patient S, who was
identified as carrying KONIH3 four months prior. A third sink drain isolate (KONIH9) was
detected a year later, despite pipe removal and thorough cleaning with wire brushes
and bleach. (Fig. 1; Table S2). All four isolates (one from a patient, three from two sinks)
show �99.99% ANI, suggesting that they are derivative isolates (Fig. 1).
Finally, a genetic connection was established between a patient isolate and a sink
drain as part of a continuation of a previously published investigation (5). Sink drain
isolate ECNIH2 (January 2012) carried three different blaKPC-containing plasmids. One of
the blaKPC-containing plasmids (pKEC-39c) was traced to a plasmid in K. pneumoniae
KPNIH27 from patient A, who stayed in that room from November 2011 to January
2012. At the time of our original study, we had no explanation for the other two
blaKPC-containing plasmids in ECNIH2, pKPC-272 and pKPC-f91. On further analysis, we
identified a blaKPC� E. cloacae isolate from patient Y (ECNIH8), who occupied the same
room (November 2010 to February 2011). This isolate is the likely recipient of the
pKEC-39c plasmid. The ECNIH8 chromosome (from February 2011) differs from ECNIH2
(January 2012) by only three SNPs (99% coverage) and carries the pKPC-272 (0 SNPs;
99% coverage) and pKPC-f91 (0 SNPs; 92% coverage) plasmids. Figure 3 shows a
proposed model of the persistent colonization of the sink drain and subsequent
plasmid transfer. Together, these data demonstrate long-term persistence of CPOs in
sink drains and the transfer of CPOs from patients to the sink drain environment.
Although it is rare to capture the details of plasmid transfer as exemplified here, transfer
of plasmids in sink biofilms may be a frequent occurrence and warrants further study.
Genomic analyses of blaKPC-containing plasmids from environmental and pa-
tient samples illustrate a broad diversity of plasmid configurations in many
species. Because transfer of carbapenemases carried on plasmids between organisms
is a public health concern (36), we moved our analysis beyond a chromosomal
comparison to a plasmid analysis with greater resolution. From this data set, each
blaKPC-containing plasmid was represented with at least one fully assembled PacBio
genome. These high-quality PacBio genomes served as references and enabled us to
resolve the plasmid sequences of related genomes, which may have only received
short-read sequencing. Similarly, genomes with limited nucleotide identity to any
previously sequenced isolate were also subjected to PacBio sequencing. In total, our
analysis included 2 genomes from Roche 454 sequencing, 55 from Illumina MiSeq
sequencing, and 51 from PacBio sequencing. The plasmid sequences of patient and
environmental isolates from MiSeq and PacBio genomes were compared by using their
k-mer composition. Sixteen-base-pair k-mers were calculated for all assemblies by using
meryl (http://kmer.sourceforge.net/), and a specific blaKPC-containing plasmid was de-
fined as present if �95% plasmid k-mers were found in the assembly (Fig. 4; Table S2).
Some blaKPC-containing plasmids were grouped together into families of plasmids
for analysis purposes. For instance, newly detected pKPC-8bc0 and pKPC-79f0 were
typed as incompatibility group N (IncN) (PubMLST) and exhibited a high level of genetic
similarity to other IncN ST6 plasmids previously detected at NIHCC (5) (Fig. S3). We have
identified this pervasive IncN family of plasmids in 7 patient and 23 environmental
isolates, including high-touch surfaces, sink drains, housekeeping closets, and ICU pipe
wastewater (Fig. 4). Similar to the IncN family, five newly identified blaKPC-containing

 plasmids, which we have named the pENT-e56 family, could be grouped on the basis
of sequence similarity. These plasmids were detected in 1 patient and 12 environmental
isolates (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the backbone of this family of blaKPC-containing plasmids
was also detected in patient and sink isolates that lacked blaKPC and the flanking
transposon (pKPN-068, pENT-e56, and pENT-d0d) (Fig. 5), suggesting possible evolution
of these plasmids through addition of the transposon.
Our study identified 27 new plasmids with carbapenemase genes based on PacBio
sequencing (Table S2). To date, only a small number of these plasmids were recovered
from our patient population (Fig. 4). Despite limited sampling, we detected six different
blaKPC-containing plasmids in Aeromonas spp. isolated from manhole wastewater,
highlighting the high plasmid diversity within this genus. Plasmid sizes ranged from 20
to �300 kb, and large plasmids (�150 kb) were detected in both wastewater and our
patient population. Interestingly, pKpQIL, a dominant blaKPC-containing plasmid
FIG 3 CPOs are able to persist and recombine in sink drains. (A) In February 2011, E. cloacae carrying two
blaKPC� plasmids was cultured from patient Y. This organism may have also colonized a sink in the
patient’
s room. (B) Eleven months later (January 2012), an isolate from patient A, who was colonized with
blaKPC� K. pneumoniae upon admission, was likely introduced into the same sink (KPNIH27). (C) KPNIH27’

environmental samples after the outbreak investigation in 2012.
Whereas most of the CPOs we detected carried the blaKPC gene, between 2014 and
2016, blaNDM-1� Acinetobacter spp. were detected in two patients and two housekeep-
ing closet drains. Chromosomally, no link could be demonstrated among these isolates,
as they belonged to different strains or species. However, the blaNDM-1 gene is carried
on a plasmid that has been described previously in other Acinetobacter spp., including
Acinetobacter lwoffii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter bereziniae, and Acinetobac-
ter schindleri (37–41). One of the first descriptions of this plasmid backbone was in
pNDM-BJ01 (JQ001791.1) (38), and variants missing a 6-kb region encoding GroE
proteins have also been described (e.g., pNDM-JN02) (42). All four isolates in this study
carried a blaNDM-1-containing plasmid similar to pNDM-JN02 but with a second small
deletion encompassing the trpF-nagA genes and two SNPs. Genomic and epidemio-
logic data could not link plasmid transmission between the housekeeping closet drains
and patient isolates, which suggests that this plasmid is widespread among Acineto-
bacter spp. beyond our institution and demonstrates a potential to persist in the
environment.
Probable nosocomial transmission from environment to patient. In June 2016,
a blaKPC� Leclercia sp. was isolated from the interior of a closet floor drain. Leclercia is
a genus within the Enterobacteriaceae family. Leclercia adecarboxylata, the only species
of this genus whose complete genome sequences is available, has been described as
an opportunistic pathogen and occasional carrier of blaNDM-1 (43). A few cases of
L. adecarboxylata infection have been documented (44–46), and at least one report
describes a case of hospital-acquired pneumonia likely due to L. adecarboxylata (47). In
August 2016, blaKPC� Leclercia sp. bacteria grew from swabs of additional housekeep-
ing closet floor drains. In September 2016, routine perirectal surveillance revealed a
new-onset blaKPC� Leclercia colonization in a hospitalized stem cell transplant recipient,
patient V. In response, the Hospital Epidemiology Service collected 39 additional
cultures from sink drains, housekeeping closet floor drains, nursing station surfaces,
isolation carts, and patient care equipment. Given our knowledge of housekeeping

a likely point source because of their use in both patient care areas and housekeeping

specific floors. Seven mop buckets were sequestered and swabbed for CPO culture. Of

 drains, and one from a mop bucket. We compared the genome sequences by using
Mash and found that the patient isolates were very similar to each other (99.99%) and
to the isolate from the mop bucket (99.91%) (clade A). The remaining five isolates
fell into two clusters, B and C, that differed from the patient cluster by �100,000
SNPs, corresponding to 97 and 93% identity, respectively. All three clusters carried
a blaKPC-containing plasmid belonging to the IncN family, a �300-kb plasmid related to
plasmids (pPSP-75c and pPSP-a3c) previously identified in Pantoea spp., and one or two
additional plasmids. We constructed a core genome phylogeny (36% of the genome) by
using ParSNP (48) to compare our isolates to existing L. adecarboxylata genomes and
found that cluster C, made up of two drain isolates, is closely related to three of four
publicly available L. adecarboxylata genomes, including the type strain L. adecarboxy-
lata ATCC 23216 (Fig. 6), suggesting identification to the species level. The A and B
clades, on the other hand, may belong to a different species or subspecies. Core
genome-based phylogeny was chosen over rRNA-based phylogeny because 16S rRNA
sequences are unreliable for the differentiation of species of the genera Enterobacter,
Leclercia, and Citrobacter (49). The similarity between the patient isolates and the mop
bucket isolate suggests a possible common source in our hospital; however, the 166
SNPs identified (excluding a variable phage region) and their even distribution through-
out the genome suggest indirect transmission. Genomic data were not sufficient to
resolve the direction of transmission; however, because this organism had not been
recovered from previous extensive surveillance of patients, and given our finding of six
isolates belonging to at least three different clades in the hospital environment, we
concluded that it was likely transmitted from an environmental source to patient V.
DISCUSSION
The presence of CPOs in the hospital environment is concerning because of the
potential for spread to an immunocompromised or otherwise vulnerable patient
population and because of the transmissibility of carbapenemase genes by mobile

 genetic elements to other bacteria within the hospital and into the community (50).
Whereas our study was not designed to investigate the water treatment systems in the
community, other studies have tested the efficacy of WWTPs receiving waste from
pharmaceutical drug manufacturers (51) and hospitals (24, 30, 52) or environmental
water such as rivers upstream or downstream of WWTPs (53). These studies have
detected MDROs throughout different steps of the treatment process, noting a reduc-
tion in numbers, but not elimination, after processing.
There have been many publications of hospital environmental investigations during
outbreaks and some during nonoutbreak periods (20, 25, 27, 54, 55). Findings from the
2011 blaKPC� K. pneumoniae outbreak investigation at NIHCC led to changes in our
infection control policies, such as implementation of environmental surveillance cul-
tures in response to newly identified CPO carriers and surveillance testing of previously
positive sites after remediation. Additional testing of wastewater from internal pipes
and external manholes was included in this study to identify possible new environ-
mental CPO reservoirs that may further characterize the plasmid ecosystem. The
genomic analyses of 108 identified CPOs derived from the screening of �9,000 patients
and �700 environmental samples over the last 5 years have improved our understand-
ing of CPO and plasmid relationships within our hospital and surrounding environment.
Overall, the NIHCC had a very low rate of CPO positivity on high-touch surfaces
sampled within the hospital (1.4%), a higher positivity rate in sinks (3.2%) and house-
keeping closets (12.5%), and an even higher positivity rate in wastewater (78.9%). For
comparison, a 2.5-year multicenter prospective survey of high-touch surfaces in patient
rooms found that ~40% of the rooms examined were contaminated with MDROs,
including Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms such as vancomycin-resistant
enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MDR K. pneumoniae, and MDR
A. baumannii. We did not investigate Gram-positive organisms in this study; further-
more, WGS was not used to investigate genetic relatedness in that study, so the
possible comparisons of studies are limited (56).
In our study, environmental CPO isolates appeared to be more susceptible to
antimicrobial agents than CPOs isolated from patients, possibly related to selective
pressure of antimicrobial agents administered to patients. The diversity of blaKPC�
species in our hospital environment, specifically in wastewater, supports the hypothesis
that environmental species can act as carriers of antimicrobial resistance genes and
associated mobile elements, which could lead to transmission to clinically significant
species (57). Further, we detected examples of highly similar plasmid backbones with
and without the blaKPC gene. This phenomenon has been described with pKPC_UVA01-
like plasmids at another hospital (58). These findings point to the utility of sequencing
all identified plasmids, not just plasmids with carbapenemase genes, as these may
provide the backbones that evolve into new resistance gene-containing plasmids.
One goal of this study was to characterize the plasmid population in our hospital,
particularly areas proximal to the patient that are more likely to be a potential source
of transmission, as well as areas more distal and less likely to be a direct source of
transmission. In our hospital, the most clinically concerning CPO has been K. pneu-
moniae carrying the pKpQIL plasmid, the organism associated with the 2011 outbreak.
This clonal strain was recovered repeatedly for several years from two patients who
acquired the organism during the outbreak and remained persistently colonized (4, 5).
However, surprisingly, pKpQIL was not detected in any environmental isolates after July
2012. This suggests that either the pKpQIL plasmid or the K. pneumoniae host was not
well adapted to environmental persistence. Likewise, blaNDM-containing plasmids have
not been disseminated broadly in our hospital environment; only one common
blaNDM-1 plasmid backbone was detected in Acinetobacter spp. from two environmental
samples. In contrast, there were common blaKPC-containing plasmid backbones found
in both environmental and patient isolates, including the IncN family of plasmids, which
was detected in 7 patient and 23 environmental isolates, strongly supporting the broad
host range of this plasmid family. A newly detected plasmid backbone, pENT-e56
family, was also found in 1 patient and 12 environmental isolates. However, we

 detected 23 blaKPC-containing plasmids exclusively in the environment. Others have
described even more extensive plasmid diversity in freshwater (59) and WWTPs (53).
Environmental sources have been implicated as the cause of many hospital out-
breaks (6, 60). Because wastewater is a known source of CPOs (15, 16, 19), it is striking
that so few bacterial strains or plasmids were found to be shared by wastewater and
patients in this study. Our study results align with findings from a few other investi-
gations; one was a study of sewage from four different hospitals that could not
correlate organisms or carbapenemase genes between patient and sewage isolates
(16). Our data support the conclusion that wastewater cannot be used as a marker of
patient colonization status. Another group sampled one hospital wastewater source on
16 separate occasions over a period of 2 months and analyzed 17 carbapenemase-
producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates by PFGE. WGS of 3 of the 17 isolates was
performed (18). No link could be established between wastewater and patient isolates.
Important limitations of our study that could affect the interpretation of results include
a very small cumulative sample volume, lack of replicate testing from the same source,
and variation in culture workup.
Although few clonal connections between wastewater and patient isolates were
established, we did identify several sink drain isolates that were highly similar, if not
clonal, to patient isolates. A recent study by Kotay et al. experimentally showed the ease
with which E. coli can disperse from a sink after seeding (61). We also detected other
CPOs in sinks and housekeeping closets that were highly related to patient isolates,
but an epidemiological link could not be established. This lack of an epidemiolog-
ical connection suggests the possibility that dominant but unrelated CPOs may be
in both patient and environment populations, as exemplified in a study where
ESBL-producing members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were found in hand-
washing sinks in the absence of colonized patients (34). However, the lack of an
identified epidemiological link could also be due to sampling error or low sensitivity
of patient microbial surveillance. It is a constant challenge for infection control
teams to distinguish nosocomial transmission from coincidentally recovered iso-
lates. Detailed chromosomal and plasmid data, such as the analyses presented here,
can greatly assist in the decision algorithm.
On the basis of our findings, we suggest that hospital environmental surveillance
should also include housekeeping areas in addition to high-touch surfaces and sink
drains. blaKPC� Leclercia spp. were not detected in NIHCC until 2016, when they were
first identified in five different housekeeping closet floor drains. These five drain
isolates, the isolate from a mop bucket, and two patient isolates formed three different
clusters. These findings suggest that multiple strains of Leclercia were present in the
hospital environment for some time before patient colonization occurred. Leclercia is
not a common pathogen, and this was our first identification of blaKPC� Leclercia spp.
Given that our surveillance program is more extensive than what many hospitals can
support, the finding leads one to consider what might be found if more hospitals were
investigated to this extent. Our data highlight the importance of consistent and
proactive patient and environmental CPO surveillance. The investigation of newly
identified CPO carriers, along with an immediate examination of hygiene practices,
followed by remediation of the environment, are all critical actions to control environ-
mental contamination and stop the potential spread of organisms within the patient
population.
The extensive surveillance performed at the NIHCC has revealed CPOs in the
environment; however, it is likely that most hospitals have some CPO colonization in
wastewater and drains that remains undetected, perhaps because these sites are not
sampled routinely or as part of investigative processes. The higher rates of CPO
detection in water-associated environments, such as ICU pipes, sinks, housekeeping
closet drains, and manhole wastewater, suggest that the hospital drainage system plays
a role in providing a stable and underappreciated reservoir of MDROs within hospitals.
The physical separation of wastewater from patients, combined with proper cleaning
practices and active infection control responses, was largely sufficient to prevent

 transmission to patients, as few clonal isolates were detected in patients and the
environment. One might expect to see more transmission if there were a breakdown of
good practices. The diversity of CPO-associated plasmids and transposon elements
from the environment and the isolation of similar plasmid backbones with and without
the blaKPC gene prompt a greater appreciation of the extensive nature and mobility of
plasmids in the environment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Setting and sample collection. Environmental samples were collected between January 2012 and
December 2016 at the NIHCC (Bethesda, MD), a 200-bed clinical research hospital (Table 1). Seven
wastewater samples were collected from two manholes outside the hospital, and nine wastewater
samples were collected from the pipes in interstitial spaces serving the ICU and non-ICU rooms. Water
samples were collected from faucets and traps of sinks in patient rooms and common areas. Surfaces
were sampled with BBL culture swabs (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) moistened
with saline or gauze incubated in 10 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB; Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA).
Approximately six inches of pipe immediately below the surfaces of the sink drains was sampled with
moistened BBL culture swabs (Becton, Dickinson and Company).
Sample processing, identification, and characterization of bacterial isolates. Swabs were trans-
ferred into 1 ml of TSB (Remel Inc., Lenexa, KS), vortexed, and plated directly. Gauze in 10 ml of TSB was
incubated overnight at 35°
C in 5% CO2 prior to culture. Wastewater samples were plated directly. One
drop of each sample suspension was cultured on CRE, ESBL, and R2A (Remel Inc.) media. A subset of
environmental samples was also cultured on 5% sheep blood agar (SB; Remel Inc.). Perirectal surveillance
cultures were plated directly onto CRE medium. Clinical cultures were plated onto routine clinical
microbiology media, which included a combination of SB, chocolate agar (Remel Inc.), MacConkey agar
(Remel Inc.), and/or Fastidious Broth (Hardy Diagnostics; Fig. S1). HardyCHROM media were incubated
overnight at 35°
C in ambient air, and R2A medium was incubated at 30°
C in ambient air. Clinical cultures
were incubated at 35°
C in 5% CO2. Colonies with different morphologies were isolated and screened by
PCR for the presence of blaKPC or blaNDM (http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/pdfs/labSettings/KPC-NDM-protocol
-2011.pdf). All isolates that tested positive for blaKPC or blaNDM by PCR were identified by MALDI-TOF MS
(BioTyper; Bruker, Billerica, MA). Susceptibility testing was performed via broth microdilution (Trek
Diagnostics, Oakwood Village, OH, or BD Phoenix, Franklin Lakes, NJ, depending on the date of isolation)
or disk diffusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lenexa, KS). Susceptibility interpretations were based on the
most recent Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints (62) (Table S1). For this study,
given our environmental screening approach, we classified as a CPO any isolate that was blaKPC� or
blaNDM� by PCR. For the antimicrobial susceptibility comparison of members of the family Enterobacte-
riaceae and to eliminate bias potentially caused by the use of different culture media for clinical and
environmental testing, blaKPC� or blaNDM� environmental Enterobacteriaceae isolates from ESBL or R2A
medium that were susceptible to two or more carbapenems were tested for growth selectivity on CRE
medium in accordance with CLSI M22-A3 guidelines (63). Briefly, a 0.5 McFarland suspension in saline was
prepared and diluted 1:10. Ten microliters was inoculated onto CRE medium and incubated at 35°
C in
ambient air for 18 to 24 h. Only isolates that grew on this confirmatory CRE agar screen were included
in the susceptibility comparison.
Genome sequencing and assembly. Genomic DNA extraction and library preparation for Illumina
MiSeq and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing were performed as described previously (64, 65).
Paired-end MiSeq reads were assembled into contigs by using SPAdes version 3.5.1 (66) and further
polished by using Pilon (67). Scaffolding of refined genome assemblies to reference genomes was
performed by using ABACAS version 1.3.1 (68). PacBio RSII SMRT sequencing reads (P6 polymerase
binding and C4 sequencing kit, 240-min collection) were assembled by using HGAP3 (PacBio SMRT
Analysis version 2.3) or CANU (version 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5) (69). The resulting contigs were polished by using
Quiver (SMRT Analysis version 2.3) and manually reviewed and finished by using Gepard (version 1.3)
(70). Base calling and finishing accuracy was assessed by using the Most Probable Genotype (71) software
with Illumina MiSeq read alignments against the finished PacBio assembly. The Integrative Genomics
Viewer (72) was used to visualize the MiSeq read alignments. Genome annotation was performed by
using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline
(PGAP, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/).
Bioinformatic analyses. Genetic relatedness between genome assemblies was assessed by ANI and
SNPs. ANI was estimated by using Mash version 1.1.1 with a k-mer size of 21 and a sketch size of 1,000
(73), while SNPs were called by using Snippy version 3.2 (BWA-MEM version 0.7.15, freebayes version
1.0.2) (https://github.com/tseemann/snippy). All SNPs required a read depth of �10 reads with �90% of
those aligned reads supporting the variant nucleotide call. Core genome alignments were performed by
using Parsnp and visualized by using Gingr (48).
Plasmid detection in shotgun assemblies was determined by using a k-mer inclusion approach.
Briefly, 16-bp k-mers were generated from the fully resolved PacBio plasmid sequences along with the
MiSeq genome assemblies by using meryl (13 May 2015 release, http://kmer.sourceforge.net/). A plasmid
was considered present within a genome assembly if �95% of the plasmid k-mers were contained
within the MiSeq genome assembly k-mers. A similar k-mer inclusion analysis of the PacBio-generated
blaKPC-positive and blaKPC-negative plasmid sequences was performed. Plasmid coverage and align-
ments were computed by using NUCmer version 3.1 (74), laid out by using a custom Perl script, and
visualized in R.
