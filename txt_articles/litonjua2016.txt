IMPORTANCE Asthma and wheezing begin early in life, and prenatal vitamin D deficiency has
been variably associated with these disorders in offspring.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether prenatal vitamin D (cholecalciferol) supplementation can
prevent asthma or recurrent wheeze in early childhood.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial was a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 3 centers across the United
States. Enrollment began in October 2009 and completed follow-up in January 2015. Eight
hundred eighty-one pregnant women between the ages of 18 and 39 years at high risk of
having children with asthma were randomized at 10 to 18 weeks’ gestation. Five participants
were deemed ineligible shortly after randomization and were discontinued.
INTERVENTIONS Four hundred forty women were randomized to receive daily 4000 IU
vitamin D plus a prenatal vitamin containing 400 IU vitamin D, and 436 women were
randomized to receive a placebo plus a prenatal vitamin containing 400 IU vitamin D.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coprimary outcomes of (1) parental report of
physician-diagnosed asthma or recurrent wheezing through 3 years of age and (2) third
trimester maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.
RESULTS Eight hundred ten infants were born in the study, and 806 were included in the
analyses for the 3-year outcomes. Two hundred eighteen children developed asthma or
recurrent wheeze: 98 of 405 (24.3%; 95% CI, 18.7%-28.5%) in the 4400-IU group vs 120 of
401 (30.4%, 95% CI, 25.7%-73.1%) in the 400-IU group (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-1.0;
P = .051). Of the women in the 4400-IU group whose blood levels were checked, 289
(74.9%) had 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 30 ng/mL or higher by the third trimester of
pregnancy compared with 133 of 391 (34.0%) in the 400-IU group (difference, 40.9%; 95%
CI, 34.2%-47.5%, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In pregnant women at risk of having a child with asthma,
supplementation with 4400 IU/d of vitamin D compared with 400 IU/d significantly
increased vitamin D levels in the women. The incidence of asthma and recurrent wheezing in
their children at age 3 years was lower by 6.1%, but this did not meet statistical significance;
however, the study may have been underpowered. Longer follow-up of the children is
ongoing to determine whether the difference is clinically important.

W
heezingillnessesbeginasearlyasthefirstfewweeks
of life, suggesting that there may be prenatal deter-
minants involved with the genesis of these ill-
nesses. Although wheezing and other asthmalike symptoms
are common in the preschool ages, it remains difficult to pre-
dict which of these preschoolers will have asthma that per-
sists through midchildhood and onward. Nevertheless, pre-
school children with wheezing have lung function deficits that
persist through later life.1,2 Thus, prenatal interventions that
prevent early recurrent wheezing may be important to re-
duce the short-term morbidity and to prevent the potential
long-term sequelae of reduced lung growth.
Vitamin D deficiency occurs worldwide. Vitamin D status
isdefinedbythecirculatinglevelof25-hydroxyvitaminD,from
either plasma or serum. Pregnant and lactating mothers and
their neonates are at especially high risk of vitamin D defi-
ciency. In a nationally representative sample of pregnant US
women, 69% had 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the insuffi-
cient range (ie, ≤30 ng/mL).3
Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy may be important in
early asthma and wheezing because vitamin D has effects on
the developing lung and immune system during the fetal and
early postnatal periods.4-8 Observational studies that have in-
vestigated the association of vitamin D in pregnancy on the
developmentofwheeze,asthma,andallergiesinearlylifehave
produced mixed results. We therefore designed a clinical trial
of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) supplementation in pregnancy
to address the question of whether supplementation with
vitamin D during pregnancy can prevent the development of
asthma-related phenotypes in very young children—the
Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART).
Methods
Participants
Pregnant women were recruited from 3 clinical sites across the
United States—Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachu-
setts;WashingtonUniversityatStLouis,StLouis,Missouri;and
Kaiser Permanente Southern California Region, San Diego. The
data coordinating center was based in the Channing Division
of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston,
Massachusetts. Eligible participants were women between the
ages of 18 and 39 years, who presented between the esti-
mated gestational ages of 10 and 18 weeks; who had a history
of asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis, or whose partner
(biologic father of the child) had a history of asthma, eczema,
or allergic rhinitis; who was a nonsmoker; and who was
English or Spanish speaking, with intent to participate for 4
years (up to the third birthday of the child). The study proto-
colwasapprovedbytheinstitutionalreviewboardsateachpar-
ticipating institution and at the Brigham and Women’s Hos-
pital. All women provided written informed consent.
Study Design
Details of the study design are available in the protocol
(Litonjua et al9 and Supplement 1). We conducted a random-
ized,double-blind,placebo-controlledstudyofvitaminD(daily
4000 IU of vitamin D plus a multivitamin with 400 IU of
vitamin D) vs placebo (daily placebo pill plus a multivitamin
with 400 IU of vitamin D). Participants were screened for eli-
gibility between October 2009 and July 2011. Follow-up of the
last child was completed in January 2015. Prenatal interval
visits, labor and delivery room data collection, and postnatal
visits and data collected during these visits are detailed in the
eMethods in Supplement 2. Study staff met with pregnant
women monthly to administer a brief health questionnaire, as-
sess medication use, and monitor for complications (via the
questionnaire and medical record review). Adherence was as-
sessed with electronic medication container caps. After de-
livery, children were monitored by telephone every 3 months
and in-person annually for 3 years, during which time in-
fants’ health, respiratory symptoms, and medications were as-
sessed.DatacollectionissummarizedineTable1,andthenum-
ber of scheduled and completed telephone calls and visits are
summarized in eTable 2, both in Supplement 2.
Randomization was performed using a system that auto-
mates the random assignment of treatment groups to study

fiedpermutedblockswithrandomlyvariedblocksizesof4and

The study had 2 primary outcomes. The first was parental
report of physician diagnosis of asthma or occurrence of recur-
rent wheeze in the child's first 3 years of life ascertained from
questionnaires administered every 3 months. Parental report
of physician's diagnosis of asthma was taken directly from the
offspringquestionnaires.Recurrentwheezewasdefinedbythe
occurrence of at least 1 of the following 5 conditions: (1) paren-
tal report of wheeze after child's second birthday preceded by
at least 1 report of wheeze prior to second birthday; (2) report
of child's use of asthma controller medication (defined as
reportofuseofsteroidinhalersornebulizers,leukotrienemodi-
fiers, or steroid pills or liquids) after the second birthday,
preceded by a report of wheeze before the second birthday;
(3) 2 or more distinct parental reports of wheeze after the sec-
ond birthday; (4) at least 1 parental report of wheeze and use
of asthma controller medications at distinct visits, both subse-
quent to the second birthday; or (5) 2 distinct reports of use of
asthma controller medications after the second birthday. The

of age, including child 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, parental
report of physician’s diagnosis of eczema with rash in typical
distribution, total IgE and allergen sensitization (specific IgE
to a panel of aeroallergens and food allergens), and lower re-
spiratory tract infections (LRIs) (defined as parental report of
physician-diagnosed bronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup, or pneu-
monia). Questions about the presence of LRIs were asked ev-

Statistical Analysis
The trial was designed to detect a 25% reduction14 in the in-
cidence of asthma and recurrent wheeze in the first 3 years of
life in the supplemented group. Using data from 2 birth
cohorts,15,16 the incidence of asthma and recurrent wheeze in
the control group was estimated at 40% to 50%, when either
the mother or the father had asthma or allergies. The recruit-
ment target was 870 pregnant women. Assuming an 8% mis-
carriage rate and 17% to 18% loss to follow-up, the targeted
sample size at age 3 years was 660 children. With a 3-year in-
cidence of 45% in the control group, the power to detect a 25%
reduction in the supplemented group was 83%.
To make full use of all available observation time and to
obtain a fully nonparametric intent-to-treat analysis, the origi-
nal protocol-based plan to base treatment effect inference on
logistic regression analysis was replaced by a plan to use
interval-censoredevent-timeanalysis.Thischangeinplanwas
reviewed and approved, prior to unbinding and analysis, by
the study’s steering committee, and the overall final analysis
was reviewed and approved by the data and safety monitor-
ing board. Tests of treatment effect for the first occurrence of
the primary outcome used either the earlier of time to asthma
diagnosis or the earliest wheeze report or medication event in-
dicative of recurrent wheeze. Distributions of outcome-free
time were compared between groups using nonparametric
maximumlikelihoodestimationtocreateKaplan-Meiercurves,
and optimal nonparametric testing with interval censored re-
sponse times.17,18 Estimates of proportions of children expe-
riencing the primary outcome at selected times are derived
from these curves (Kaplan-Meier estimates). The nonpara-
metric procedure with interval-censored response times does
not allow incorporation of covariate effects. The Weibull fam-
ily of parametric models for interval-censored event times19
was used to conduct adjusted testing and estimation of treat-
ment and covariate effects. Additional models incorporating
effects of clinical center and maternal educational level were
conducted post hoc using logistic regression based on the sub-
set of participants providing complete follow-up times, and in-
terval censored Weibull regression using all available obser-
vation time.
Outcome events were analyzed using the interval formed
from the last negative visit and first positive visit or depar-
ture from or completion of the study. Individuals who had no
reports of asthma or recurrent wheeze up to the time of de-
parture from the study were censored at that time.
Reports of LRIs were counted, represented as an integer-
valued outcome variable and analyzed using a negative bino-
mial generalized linear model to accommodate extra-Poisson
variation.20 The effect of treatment on the LRI rate per month
was estimated using the log of person-months in the study as
offset. Mean total IgE at age 3 years was compared between
groups using a common-variance t test with log-transformed
measures. Analyses of maternal vitamin D and secondary out-
comes assume missingness occurred completely at random.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc.) and R version 3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing;packagesinterval,survival,ggplot2).Alltestswere
2-sided and the significance level was prespecified at P < .05,
even for the coprimary outcomes because these have distinct
interpretations.
Results
Characteristics of the Trial Population
Eight hundred eighty-one women were randomized (Figure 1),
but 5 women were found to be ineligible, resulting in 876
women—440 to the 4400 IU/d vitamin D group and 436 to the
400 IU/d vitamin D group. The baseline characteristics of the
pregnant women were comparable between the 2 treatment
groups (Table 1). For the analyses on the childhood outcomes,

data on 806 mothers and their children were available—405 in
the 4400-IU group vs 401 in the 400-IU group (35 participants
in the 4400-IU group and 35 participants in the 400-IU group

Effect of Treatment on Maternal, Cord Blood,
and Child 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels
Maternal levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the third trimester
were higher in the 4400-IU group (mean, 39.2 ng/mL) vs the
400-IU group (mean, 26.8 ng/mL; mean difference, 12.4; 95%
CI, 10.5-14.3 ng/mL, P < .001; eFigure 1A in Supplement 2). The
proportion of women who achieved 25-hydroxyvitamin D lev-
els higher than 30 ng/mL in the 4400-IU group (74.9%) was
greaterthanthatinthe400-IUgroup(34.0%;difference,40.9%,

Effect of Treatment on Asthma/Recurrent Wheeze
Two hundred eighteen (27%) of the eligible 806 children de-
veloped asthma or recurrent wheezing according to the com-
posite definition by their third-year visit with many children
fulfillingmultiplecriteriaandwithbroadoverlapbetweenthese
criteria (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). There were 58 children for
whom the outcome could not be resolved (29 in the 4400-IU
group and 29 in the 400-IU group) because they were miss-
ing interim- or final-visit data that would have categorized the
outcome; however, all available observation time on all 806
children was used in the interval-censored analysis. In the
4400-IU group, 98 children (estimate, 24.3%, 95% CI, 18.7%-
28.5%) developed asthma or recurrent wheeze by age 3 years,
whereas in the 400-IU group, 120 children (estimate, 30.4%;
95% CI, 25.7%-73.1%) developed asthma or recurrent wheeze
by age 3 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-1.0; non-
parametric P = .051) (Figure 2 and Table 3). The estimates of
the incidence of asthma or recurrent wheeze at 1 year were
16.0% (95% CI, 11.6%-19.5%) in the 4400-IU group vs 24.9%
(95% CI, 20.2%-31.7%) in the 400-IU group. At 2 years of age,
the estimates were 22.0% (95% CI, 16.7%-26.5%) in the
4400-IU group vs 29.4% (95% CI, 25.2-36.1) in the 400-IU
group.
Weperformedsensitivityanalysestocomplementthemain
intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (eResults and eTable 4 in
Supplement 2), using a Weibull model for interval-censored
event times and a logistic regression analysis using only indi-
vidualswhoprovidedthefull3-yearoutcomes(n = 748).When
adjustments for site and maternal education were made, in-
ferencesandestimatesoftreatmenteffectwereconsistentwith
the primary ITT analysis for both modeling approaches. For
the site-adjusted logistic regression, the odds ratio (OR) was
0.74 (95% CI, 0.54-1.02; P = .063) and for the site and educa-
tion adjusted model, the OR was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.52-1.00;
P = .049).
Secondary Outcomes
The results of the analyses on the secondary outcomes are pre-
sented in Table 3. There were no significant differences in the
development of eczema, LRI, and total IgE levels. However,
children in the 4400-IU group had fewer positive specific IgE
tests (10.7%, 95% CI, 9.4%-12.1%) than children in the 400 IU/d
group (12.4%, 95% CI, 11.45-13.5%, P = .02).
Safety
There were no significant differences in the rates of severe ad-
verse events between the 2 treatment groups (eResults and
eTable 5 in Supplement 2), and no adverse event was attrib-
uted to vitamin D treatment. No events of hypercalcemia in
the mothers occurred with vitamin D treatment.
Discussion
This randomized, double-blinded multicenter clinical trial
studied effects of prenatal treatment with vitamin D on 806
infants followed up from birth to 3 years. The study demon-
strated that supplementation with 4400 IU/d of vitamin D sig-
nificantly raised 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in pregnant
women. We estimated that the 3-year incidence of asthma or
recurrentwheezeintheinfantswas24.3%with4400-IU/dand
30.4% with a 400-IU/d supplement. This absolute reduction
of 6.1% was not statistically significant (P = .051). Both the
3-year incidence of asthma or recurrent wheeze observed for
recipients of 400 IU/d and the reduction associated with the
4400 IU/d treatment were less than we hypothesized when we
designedthestudy;thus,thestudypowermayhavebeenlower
than anticipated. In addition, most of the secondary out-
comes were not statistically significantly different between
groups, and these analyses should be considered exploratory
given the null primary outcome and the absence of adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons. Therefore, whether supple-
mentation of pregnant women with vitamin D will reduce
asthma and recurrent wheeze in their offspring at age 3 years
remainsunclear.Largerstudiesandlongerfollow-upofthechil-
dren in this study will be needed to answer the question. If ad-
ditional studies identify a significant effect, given the high
prevalence of low vitamin D levels in pregnant women, the ef-
fect of this inexpensive intervention on child health could be
substantial.
At present, there is no consensus on the definition of a
minimal clinically important difference for prenatal interven-
tions against offspring asthma and wheezing. A multicenter
trial involving 6154 primary care clinic participants that used
a multiintervention approach (increased intake of n-3 poly-
unsaturated fatty acids and oily fish, reduced parental smok-
ing, and reduced indoor dampness) showed a lower asthma in-
cidence by 2 years of age in the intervention group (71 of 1374,
5.2%) vs the control group (337 of 4780, 7.1%) with a differ-
ence of 1.9% (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93).21 Another multi-

intervention trial (avoidance of house dust mite, pet allergen,
and environmental tobacco smoke; encouragement of breast-
feeding; and delayed introduction of solid foods) in 545 high-
risk infants on the basis of an immediate family history found
a decreased asthma incidence in 2-year old children in the in-
tervention (40 of 246, 16.3%) vs the control (53 of 230, 23.0%)
groups, for a 6.7% difference (adjusted OR, 0.60, 95% CI,
0.37-0.95). The effect sizes for these diverse interventions
are of comparable magnitude to our estimate of prenatal
vitamin D supplementation.
Although the diagnosis of asthma in early life is difficult,
the primary symptom associated with asthma—wheezing—is
common in this period in life, with attendant high resource
utilization.22 It is recognized that several wheezing pheno-
types exist in early childhood (≤3 years old), and a subset of
these children (about 40%) will have symptoms that persist
through age 6 years23 and are ultimately diagnosed as asthma.
Although several asthma predictive indices have been tested,
these are specific but not very sensitive predictors of asthma
that persists through age 6 years.24,25 Wheezing in early life,
withorwithoutasubsequentasthmadiagnosis,mayhavelong-
term consequences, such as deficits in lung function in
adolescence,1 impairments in aspects of health-related qual-
ity of life,26 and more rapid lung function declines in tran-
sient wheezers despite attaining normal lung function in early
adulthood.27 Therefore, we chose the outcome of a parental
report of asthma or recurrent wheeze by 3 years of age be-
cause we hypothesized that prenatal interventions are likely
to affect this early phenotype.
A number of limitations in VDAART are worthy of men-
tion. The population was selected because the offspring of
these mothers were at high risk of asthma and allergies; thus,
caution should be exercised before generalizing these results
to nonhigh-risk populations. Timing of vitamin D supplemen-
tation during pregnancy may not have been ideal. On aver-
age, supplementation was initiated at about the 14th week of
gestation, but lung development begins in the 4th week of
gestation.28 Finally, fewer women than expected achieved the
target threshold level of 30 ng/mL of 25-hydroxyvitamin D by
the third trimester, suggesting that the dose of 4400 IU/d may
not be adequate for all pregnant women.
Because lung development continues throughout
childhood,28 it is possible that vitamin D continues to exert its
influence on the respiratory and immune systems in the post-
natal period. In this trial, we saw a significant difference in 25-
hydroxyvitamin D levels in cord blood between the 2 groups,
butthisdifferencedisappearedby1year.Consistentwiththese
findings, the differences in asthma or recurrent wheeze be-
tween the 2 groups in the first year were greater than in the
second and third years, suggesting an early effect that was not
sustained. Thus, adequate vitamin D supplementation after
birth to maintain 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the suffi-
cient range, in addition to prenatal supplementation, may be
needed to more fully prevent wheezing illnesses, and per-
haps asthma, in early life.
Allofthesefactors—thetimingoftheintervention,thedose
of vitamin D administered, adherence with treatment, and in-
adequatepostnatalvitaminDsupplementation—mayhavelim-
itedtheeffectoftheinterventiononasthmaorrecurrentwheeze
by 3 years. Future studies will need to address these issues.
Conclusions
In pregnant women at risk of having a child with asthma,
supplementation with 4400 IU/d of vitamin D compared with
400IU/dsignificantlyincreasedvitaminDlevelsinthewomen.
The incidence of asthma and recurrent wheezing in their chil-
dren at age 3 years was lower by 6.1%, but this did not meet
statistical significance; however, the study may have been un-
derpowered. Longer follow-up of the children is ongoing to de-
termine whether the difference is clinically important.
