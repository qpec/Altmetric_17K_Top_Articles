Abstract
Importance—Oxidative stress is an established dementia pathway, but it is unknown if the use of 
antioxidant supplements can prevent dementia.
Objective—To determine if antioxidant supplements (vitamin E or selenium) used alone or in 
combination can prevent dementia in asymptomatic older men.
Design—PREADVISE, designed to answer this question, began as a double-blind, randomized 
controlled trial in 2002 which transformed into a cohort study from 2009–2015.
Setting—PREADVISE was ancillary to SELECT, a randomized controlled trial of the same anti-
oxidant supplements for preventing prostate cancer. SELECT closed in 2009 due to a futility 
analysis.

 Participants—PREADVISE recruited 7,540 men, of whom 3,786 continued into the cohort 
study. Participants were at least 60 years old at study entry and were enrolled at one of 130 
SELECT sites.
Intervention—Participants were randomized to vitamin E, selenium, vitamin E + selenium, or 
placebo. While taking study supplements, PREADVISE men visited their SELECT site and were 
evaluated for dementia using a two-stage screen. During the cohort study, men were contacted by 
telephone and assessed using an enhanced two-stage cognitive screen. In both phases, men were 
encouraged to visit their doctor if the screen indicated possible cognitive impairment.
Main Outcome—Dementia case ascertainment relied on a consensus review of the cognitive 
screens and medical records for those suspected cases that visited their doctor for an evaluation, or 
by review of all supplemental information provided by SELECT, including a functional 
assessment screen.
Results—Under a modified intent-to-treat analysis, dementia incidence (4.43%) was not 
different among the four study arms. A Cox model, which adjusted incidence for participant 
demographics and baseline self-reported co-morbidities, yielded hazard ratios of 0.88 (95% CI: 
0.64–1.20) for vitamin E, 1.00 (0.75–1.35) for the combination, and 0.83 (0.60–1.13) for selenium 
compared to placebo.
Conclusions and Relevance—Neither supplement prevented dementia. This is the first study 
to investigate the long term effect of anti-oxidant supplement use on dementia incidence among 
asymptomatic men.

Introduction
In the United States (US) an estimated 5 million elderly have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and 
AD cases are expected to increase substantially by 2050.1 A recent review of clinical trials 
from 1984–2014 shows a focus on enrolling mild to moderate dementia cases in many trials 
with no real progress on identifying disease modifying treatments2. As a result, there has 
been a shift in focus to clinical trials emphasizing the prevention of cognitive decline, 
especially through secondary prevention trials targeting high risk groups3,4 and large trials 
that promote lifestyle changes to address modifiable risk factors for AD5,6. The usual 
primary endpoints of these trials are cognitive decline or composites of biomarkers and 
cognitive measures7. The gold standard of prevention is disease incidence, but few current 
trials have this as their primary endpoint because of the time required to observe reductions 
in disease incidence.
Multiple mechanisms associated with disease onset and progression have been described,8 
and one key mechanism implicated in AD is oxidative stress,9 which may be modifiable 
through diet and/or antioxidant supplements10. Antioxidant use as a potential treatment for 
cognitive impairment or dementia has been of interest for many years. Vitamin E has had 
mixed results in treatment trials: in moderately demented patients treated for two years, its 
use slowed disease progression,11 but more recently, when used in an antioxidant cocktail, 
its use failed to improve cognition in AD patients with mild to moderate dementia12. It also

 failed as a preventive agent for dementia progression in subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI),13 although early in the trial its use did somewhat improve cognition. A 
review of controlled trials and case-control studies on the use of selenium in arresting the 
progression of AD also yields mixed results14. Observational studies correlate cognitive 
decline with decreased plasma selenium over time15,16. However, nothing is known about 
long-term use of these supplements as preventative agents in asymptomatic individuals. The 
purpose of this manuscript is to address this gap in the literature.
Specifically, this manuscript reports the main results of the Prevention of Alzheimer’s 
Disease with Vitamin E and Selenium (PREADVISE) primary prevention trial. 
PREADVISE, the largest primary prevention trial in AD to date, began in 2002 as an 
ancillary trial within the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), a 
double-blind, randomized controlled prostate cancer prevention trial17. When SELECT 
ended prematurely in 2009 due to a futility analysis, PREADVISE continued as a cohort 
study for a subset of its enrollees18. Extended follow-up over a seven-year period (blinded) 
allowed for case ascertainment, yielding a comparison of the study arms for effectiveness in 
preventing dementia. We present the results of this large primary prevention study of 
antioxidant supplements as a method to modify oxidative stress, one mechanism in the 
evolution of AD9.
Methods
Design
Study design19, participant recruitment20, and the conversion of the trial into a cohort 
study18 are described in earlier publications. Briefly, the parent study, SELECT, was 
designed as a double-blind, four-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) and initiated 
enrollment in 200117. SELECT’s primary aim was to determine the effectiveness of the 
antioxidant supplements vitamin E (400 IU/day) and selenium (200 μg/day) alone or in 
combination in preventing prostate cancer. PREADVISE recruited a subsample of SELECT 
participants age 62 and over (age 60 if black) at 130 participating clinical sites in the US, 
Canada, and Puerto Rico. PREADVISE enrolled 7,540 non-demented SELECT men 
between 2002 and 2008 (Appendix, CONSORT diagram). The RCT was powered to detect a 
hazard rate of 0.60 with 80% power assuming a targeted enrollment of 10,400 men; this was 
then lowered to a detectable hazard rate 0.5 once the actual enrollment finished at 7,540 
men.
Study eligibility required SELECT enrollment at a participating site and absence of: 
dementia, active neurologic and/or neuropsychiatric conditions that affect cognition, as well 
as history of serious head injury (>30-minute loss of consciousness within the last five years 
prior to enrollment) and substance abuse. The RCT was scheduled to continue supplements 
until 2012 but in September 2008, the SELECT Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
recommended that supplements be discontinued due to lack of efficacy on prostate cancer 
incidence. Study sites closed over the next two years, during which time both PREADVISE 
and SELECT transitioned into cohort studies18,21. RCT participants were asked to continue 
in the cohort study, and 4,271 of the original 7,540 PREADVISE men consented to continue 
annual memory screenings, which were then conducted by telephone. All study activities

 were approved by Institutional Review Boards at the University of Kentucky and at each 
SELECT site. All participants provided written informed consent.
Screening
The Memory Impairment Screen (MIS)22 was used as the primary screening instrument in 
both the RCT and cohort study. Participants who scored below cutoffs for intact cognition 
received a secondary screening instrument. The modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive 
Status (TICS-m)23 was used during the cohort study, replacing the expanded Consortium to 
Establish a Registry in Alzheimer’s Disease (CERADe) neuropsychological battery24 used 
during the RCT. Annual screenings were completed in May 2014, and case ascertainment 
follow-up continued until fall 2015. All PREADVISE participants who completed at least 
one follow-up visit were included in the current analyses (intent-to-treat analysis, ITT), 
whether they participated in just the RCT or both the RCT and cohort studies.
Case Ascertainment
Dementia incidence, the primary endpoint, was determined by one of two methods. First, if a 
man failed both the first tier of the screen (MIS ≤5 out of 8) and the second tier (T Score ≤ 
35 on the CERAD battery, total score ≤ 35 on the TICS-m), then he was encouraged to 
obtain a memory work-up from his local clinician and share the medical records with 
PREADVISE. Medical records were reviewed by a team of 2–3 expert neurologists and 2–3 
expert neuropsychologists to determine a consensus diagnosis. Participants who did not 
obtain the work-up were assessed by additional longitudinal measures collected during the 
study. These included the AD8 Dementia Screening Interview26, self-reported medical 
history, self-reported medication use, and cognitive scores including the MIS, CERAD T 
Score, NYU Paragraph Delayed Recall27, and TICS-m. An AD8 ≥1 (at any time during 
follow-up) plus a self-reported dementia diagnosis, use of a memory enhancing prescription 
drug (i.e., donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine), or cognitive score ≥1.5 
standard deviations below expected performance yielded a dementia diagnosis. The 
diagnosis date was assigned to the earliest event.
Statistical Methods
Groups were compared using chi-square statistics for categorical variables and two-sample t-
tests or analysis of variance for interval level variables. Cox proportional hazards models 
were used perform a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis to compare hazard rates 
among the study arms. Hazard ratios were adjusted for the following covariates: baseline 
age, black race, APOE ε4 carrier status (present or absent), college education, baseline MIS 
score, and the presence/absence of the following self-reported co-morbidities at 
PREADVISE baseline: coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure 
(CHF), diabetes, hypertension, stroke, sleep apnea, and memory change or problem. In this 
analysis, survival time is the time from PREADVISE baseline to ascertainment of a case 
(event) or last cognitive assessment (right censored). All dropouts due to death, personal 
withdrawals from the study, and administrative withdrawals (e.g., SELECT sites not re-
consenting men for the cohort study) were right censored. The proportional hazards 
assumption required by the Cox model was checked using martingale residuals and 
Schoenfeld residuals. The latter analysis indicated that proportionality was met for the

 indicators of the treatment arms and all covariates except for the indicators of baseline 
memory problems and baseline MIS score less than 7 or 8. A stratified analysis using the 
combination of these latter two variables yielded the same results for the effect of the 
treatment arms. Therefore, the original Cox model is reported here. Missing APOE ε4 
carrier status values (4.8% of the subjects) were imputed; a re-analysis limited to known 
APOE ε4 yielded virtually the same results as those reported here.
Three additional analyses were conducted. First, the observations were weighted by 
treatment compliance. This weight equaled the length of time the man could take the 
supplements (time between enrollment and the date the supplements were stopped) 
multiplied by the proportion of visits at which the man was compliant with assigned 
supplement one (vitamin E or placebo) or compliant with supplement two (selenium or 
placebo), whichever was greater. Compliance information was based on returned pill counts. 
For example, suppose a randomly selected study participant had three years on treatment, 
and he was found to be 50% compliant with assigned treatment. The weight assigned to that 
man’s record was 1.5 (3 years × 50% compliance, normed to make the sum of all weights 
equal the sample size for this analysis given the 7,289 men with compliance information). 
Second, the Cox models were re-fitted using only medical records-based dementia cases as 
the outcome (cases identified without medical records were right censored).
Results
Table 1 shows that participants evaluated with at least one memory screen in the cohort 
study (n=3,786) were similar to the complete PREADVISE enrollment, except possibly for 
less education at the college level or higher (52.2% versus 60%), fewer black participants 
(8.4% versus 10.0%), and fewer Hispanic participants (2.5% versus 6.9%). Table 2 lists 
participant characteristics at the time of PREADVISE enrollment by study arm. Based on 
the means and percentages, despite randomization occurring at SELECT baseline rather than 
PREADVISE enrollment, there were no perceivable differences between study arms in terms 
of medical history, APOE ε4 genotype, or initial MIS.
Incident dementia cases were defined as above. There were 325/7,540 incident dementia 
cases in the study (4.31%) and, of these, 121/325 (37.2%) provided medical records (Table 
3). Unadjusted cumulative incidence varied among the study arms: 3.95% in the vitamin E 
arm, 4.15% in the selenium arm, 4.62% in the placebo arm, and 4.96% in the combination 
arm (Table 3).
To compare the hazard rates for dementia among the four study arms, mITT analysis based 
on a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to the data. The mITT analysis excluded 201 
participants who had only a baseline visit. Hence, the Cox model included 7,338 men with at 
least one follow-up visit. None of the active study arms had a significantly lower adjusted 
hazard rate for incident dementia when compared to the placebo arm; the selenium arm had 
a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.83 vs. placebo (95% CI: 0.61–1.13), while the vitamin E arm had 
HR=0.88 (95% CI: 0.64–1.20) (Table 4). The combined supplements arm was 
indistinguishable from the placebo arm had HR=1.00 (95% CI: 0.74–1.35) (Figure 1).

 Since this was a truncated RCT (due to the futility analysis for the SELECT trial as 
described above), the Cox model was re-fitted by weighting each man’s survival time to 
dementia by the length of time that man was exposed (time on supplement) multiplied by the 
estimated proportion of this time that the man was compliant with the assigned treatment 
(i.e., compliance). The weighted analysis showed results similar to the unweighted mITT 
analysis (Table 4).
Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, the analysis was restricted to the 3,786 
participants who volunteered for the cohort study and were screened by telephone at least 
once; here, the number of incident dementia cases was 228. The reported effects were 
HR=0.92 (95% CI: 0.63–1.34) for selenium and HR=0.97 (95%CI: 0.65–1.43) for E and 
HR=1.18 (95% CI: 0.82–1.68) for both. Second, the analysis used all 7,338 subjects with at 
least one annual follow-up screen, but only classified a participant as having dementia if 
confirmed by medical records. This reduced the number of events to 121 as stated above 
yielding HR = 0.70 (95%CI: 0.41–1.19) for selenium, HR=0.80 (95%CI: 0.59–1.62) for 
vitamin E and HR=0.97 (95%CI: 0.60–1.58) for both.
Discussion
PREADVISE was a double-blind RCT conducted as an ancillary study to a cancer 
prevention trial (SELECT), both of which evolved into observational cohort studies. This 
trial investigated whether the supplements vitamin E and selenium used alone or in 
combination would prevent new AD or dementia cases. The results showed that neither 
vitamin E or selenium (with 5.4± 1.2 years of supplement use) had a significant preventive 
effect on incidence. One possible explanation for the negative findings is that the trial met 
only 75% of its planned accrual; however, the results also show that the effect sizes observed 
for either supplement are likely much lower than the projected HR of 0.6019. Nevertheless, 
this is the first, large-scale primary prevention trial to investigate the effect of antioxidant 
supplements on reducing dementia incidence.
PREADVISE is a member of the first generation of AD prevention trials28–31, all of which 
failed in their primary goal. One common reason for the failure of those trials was the low 
incidence of AD and dementia observed during follow-up. This was attributed partially to 
selection bias, since participants had higher levels of education than the general population 
and perhaps more cognitive reserve. Dementia incidence among PREADVISE participants 
was very low for several additional reasons. Case ascertainment could not use modern 
diagnostic procedures since suspected cases did not, as a rule, visit dementia specialists for 
diagnosis. Instead, ascertainment relied on a consensus review of medical records derived 
from a variety of care providers. Case ascertainment was also affected by continual staff 
turnover at study sites in the RCT component of the study, which was associated with a low 
cognitive screen failure rate (less than 1%). The failure rate increased substantially once 
centralized follow-up began18.
The rationale for this trial was supported by results from the basic sciences, as well as 
observational and prospective studies in humans suggesting that the use of antioxidants 
improved cognition and reduced dementia incidence. The studies preceding the trial focused

 more on the benefits of vitamin E, since at that time it was being evaluated in a number of 
therapeutic trials, including a trial that studied its effect on the progression of MCI to 
dementia13. As in the MCI trial, vitamin E had no effect on dementia incidence in the 
asymptomatic cohort in PREADViSE.
A recent review of studies on selenium argues that selenium is vital for central nervous 
system function and that brain selenium levels are maintained at the expense of other 
tissues32. A study of 2,000 rural Chinese over age 64 years showed that participants in the 
lowest quintile of nail selenium levels had significantly lower scores on all instruments in 
the CERAD battery except for animal fluency16. It is well known that high levels of 
selenium are toxic, inducing a severe selenosis by pro-oxidant action and glial activation, 
leading to neuronal death33.
For PREADVISE, dose decisions were made by a committee in the parent SELECT study34. 
The absence of biomarkers for target engagement of the supplements makes it difficult to 
translate basic science findings into prevention trials in a rigorous manner.
Data monitoring in SELECT showed that selenium appeared to elevate levels of Type II 
diabetes, although this elevated rate subsequently decreased with additional follow-up and 
that vitamin E appeared to increase prostate cancer incidence35. The supplements had no 
effect on mortality, other cancers, cardiovascular events, nausea, fatigue, or nail changes. 
Selenium was associated with a significant increase in alopecia and grade 1–2 dermatitis17 
(Tables 4–5).
The transitioning process cost the study about half of its participants for long-term follow-
up; this was unavoidable since the study had to rely on SELECT sites to enroll the 
participants for the cohort study. Fortunately, Table 1 shows that the major cost was sample 
size (reduction in person-years of follow-up) since no new large selection biases were 
introduced. Aside from the transitioning to a cohort study from an RCT, PREADVISE had 
other limitations. Publicity about the negative effect of supplements may have affected the 
conduct of both the RCT and cohort study. SELECT reports on the potentially harmful 
effects of vitamin E (increased prostate cancer) and selenium (potentially increased 
diabetes), coupled with outside negative reports on vitamin E (i.e., increased mortality36) 
created issues to be addressed37. Many individuals who failed the screening instruments 
refused to see clinicians for further testing; recent research suggests that this could be due to 
the stigma attached to such an event or living alone38. This complicated case ascertainment. 
AD diagnoses that rely on the choice of cut points on neuropsychological tests have been 
shown to fail to identify individuals in the initial symptomatic stages of the disease39. 
Hence, our methods for case ascertainment could have missed cases that would have been 
identified by more rigorous in-clinic examinations. Future trials may benefit from electronic 
medical records. The reluctance to visit doctors prompted the introduction of the AD8 
during the follow-up phase of the study, which could have induced bias due to the inability 
of participants or informants to distinguish anosognosia from dementia. This is a likely a 
small bias since examining the subjects with medical records showed a high level of 
agreement with the AD8 as also evidenced in another study40. The reliability of telephone 
assessments versus in-clinic assessments used in the two phases of the study was less of an

 issue due to high intraclass correlations, which were in the range 0.92–0.9841. In addition, 
the TICS-m has been shown to be a reliable discriminator between cognitively intact 
individuals and those with amnestic MCI42.
Conclusion
The supplemental use of vitamin E and selenium did not forestall dementia and are not 
recommended as preventative agents. This conclusion is tempered by the underpowered 
study, inclusion of only men, a sort supplement exposure time, dosage considerations, and 
methodologic limitations in relying on real world reporting of incident cases.
