Abstract  
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer.  Both environmental and 
genetic risk factors contribute to lung carcinogenesis. We conducted a genome-wide interaction analysis 
between SNPs and smoking status (never vs ever smokers) in a European-descent population. We 
adopted a two-step analysis strategy in the discovery stage: we first conducted a case-only interaction 
analysis to assess the relationship between SNPs and smoking behavior using 13,336 NSCLC cases.  
Candidate SNPs with p-value less than 0.001 were further analyzed using a standard case-control 
interaction analysis including 13970 controls. The significant SNPs with p-value less than 3.5x10-5 
(correcting for multiple tests) from the case-control analysis in the discovery stage were further 
validated using an independent replication dataset comprising 5377 controls and 3054 NSCLC cases. We 
further stratified the analysis by histological subtypes. Two novel SNPs, rs6441286 and rs17723637, 
were identified for overall lung cancer risk. The interaction odds ratio and meta-analysis p-value for 
these two SNPs were 1.24 with 6.96x10-7 and 1.37 with 3.49x10-7, respectively.  Additionally, interaction 
of smoking with rs4751674 was identified in squamous cell lung carcinoma with an odds ratio of 0.58 
and p-value of 8.12x10-7. This study is by far the largest genome-wide SNP-smoking interaction analysis 
reported for lung cancer. The three identified novel SNPs provide potential candidate biomarkers for 
lung cancer risk screening and intervention. The results from our study reinforce that gene-smoking 
interactions play important roles in the etiology of lung cancer and account for part of the missing 
heritability of this disease. 
Summary: We conducted a genome-wide gene-smoking interaction analysis in non-small cell lung cancer 
using genotype from 35,737 individuals including both discovery and validation datasets.  We identified 
three novel SNPs with significant interactions with tobacco smoking.

Introduction 
Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related 
death in both men and women in the United States (1). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) contributes 
to about 80-85% of lung cancer cases (2). NSCLC has three major subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous 
cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. About 40% of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, while squamous cell 
carcinoma represents about 25-30% of NSCLC and is strongly related to a history of having ever smoked 
(3-5).  
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying common variants 
associated with lung cancer in the past decade. The identified susceptibility genes include the CHRNA5, 
CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 genes at 15q25, TERT at 5p15, the HLA region at 6p21, TP63 at 3q28, and several 
additional variants (6-13). Most of the identified common variants have a relatively small genetic effect 
(Odds Ratio (OR) < 1.5) and together account for a  fraction of the heritability of lung cancer. Gene-
environment interactions are believed to explain part of the missing heritability (14). Tobacco smoking is 
the major risk factor associated with lung cancer risk and about 80% to 90% of European-descent lung 
cancer cases have a history of exposure to cigarette smoke (15). Interactions between genes and 
smoking behavior play an important role in the development of lung cancer (16-18). An interaction 
effect manifests itself when the disease risk associated with a genotype varies by smoking behavior. In 
2014, Zhang and his colleague detected two SNPs rs1316298 and rs4589502 (OR: 0.71, p value 6.73x10-6; 
and OR 1.55, p value 3.84x10-6, respectively) in a genome-wide gene-smoking interaction scanning using 
genotype data from 3865 cases and 4566 controls from a Han Chinese population (16). Studies of gene-
smoking interactions are important in deciphering the lung cancer etiology because they will reveal

those genes involved in lung tumorigenesis that interacting with tobacco smoking that would not be 
discovered by main effect association analysis without jointly modeling with smoking status.  The 
identified genetic variants with heterogeneous effects between subgroups defined by smoking behavior 
will contribute to lung cancer risk prediction and disease prevention.  
However, genome-wide interaction scanning remains a challenge. Most GWAS studies were designed 
for main effect association analysis and have limited power for interaction analysis. Analyses of power 
show that a sample size at least a four-fold larger is required for interaction analysis if a standard case-
control design is used and the power limitations are more extreme when the effect size is modest or the 
risk allele has a lower frequency (19). In the absence of gene-environment correlation, a case-only 
approach has been shown to be much more powerful than a standard case-control design (20-21).  If the 
gene environment independence assumption is not met, then false positives can be introduced when a 
case-only design is followed. A two-step test strategy was proposed by researchers for gene-
environment interaction analysis: step 1, comprises a case-only test to test the association between 
SNPs and environmental risk factor; step 2, candidate SNPs from step 1 were further submitted to 
standard case-control logistic interaction analysis (21). There are two advantages using this 2-step study 
design: first, the step 1 test allows us to filter the SNPs tested in step2 thus reducing the power loss from 
multiple comparisons in the step 2 test; and second, standard case-control interaction analysis in step 2 
is more stringent and is robust to the gene-environment requirement of the case-only design, thus 
reducing the false discovery rate that may otherwise plague the case-only design.   
The current reports on genome-wide gene-smoking interaction analysis in lung cancer are still quite 
limited (16). To explore gene-smoking interactions in NSCLC lung cancer development in a European-
decent population, we conducted a genome-wide interaction analysis based on about 500,000 SNPs 
genotype data from about 27,000 individuals of European descent. We tested the interactions between

each SNP and the smoking status (never-smokers vs ever smokers). The interaction analyses were 
further categorized by lung cancer histology subtypes including adenocarcinoma and squamous cell 
carcinoma.  The candidate SNPs were further validated using independent genotype data from another 
sample of about 8, 400 individuals. As far as we know, this is the largest genome-wide SNP-smoking 
interaction analysis in lung cancer study up to date. 
Materials and methods 
Study populations 
The discovery genotype data in this study came from OncoArray consortium which was designed to 
identify genetic variants associated with common cancers including breast, colon, lung, prostate and 
ovarian cancers (22). We restricted the analysis to individuals with European ancestry and valid 
information on smoking status and lung cancer histology (23). The smoking status was denoted as 
never- versus ever-smokers, and ever-smokers included current and former smokers based on self-
reported information about smoking status when the samples were recruited. The large sample size 
(n>25,000) in the discovery phase derives from samples that were collected from 28 individual 
institutes. To minimize the potential for false positive findings, we randomly grouped the data into three 
balanced data sets S1-S3 (Table S1). The three subsets serve as internal replication datasets for the 
associations, and help to reduce the potential for spurious association findings. The sample size from the 
28 sites ������ ���� ��� �� ����� W� ���������� ����������d the sites to three groups following two 
criteria: 1, there are sites with sample size > 1000 and sites with sample size < 1000 in each group; 2, the 
sample size of each group are balanced (within range of average±500). There are 9480, 9059 and 8767 
individuals in S1-S3 which sum to 13970 controls and 13336 patients with NSCLC lung cancer (Table 1). 
The NSCLC lung cancer cases includes 7015 adenocarcinoma patients and 4529 squamous cell carcinoma

patients. All the samples were genotyped using the Illumina OncoArray-500K BeadChip (22). The 
independent replication data includes 5377 controls and 3054 NSCLC cases genotyped on a separate 
Affymetrix array (24). The smoking statuses in the replication data were recorded following the same 
classification as in the discovery data. The percentage of never smokers in the control samples are 
32.14% and 29.85% in discovery and replication data; and 10.49% and 11.43% in the disease samples in 
the discovery and replication data, respectively (Table 1). 
Ethics statement 
All subjects provided informed consent, and the institutional review boards of each participating 
institutes approved this collaborative study.  
Genotype data quality control 
In the discovery stage, we started with genotypes from 43,959 samples on 517820 SNPs. We inferred 
ancestry information using the FastPop program and individuals with probability of European ancestry 
greater than 0.8 were inferred as having European-descent population (25). IBD analysis and sex 
checking were conducted as quality control checks to identify close relatives or possible sample 
processing issues. Individuals and SNPs with genotype call rate less than 0.95 were excluded from the 
analysis. IBD analysis was further performed among samples between discovery and replication data 
sets, and duplicate samples included in discovery study were removed. A total of 27,306 individuals 
including 13,970 controls and 13,336 patients with NSCLC lung cancer were included in the discovery 
study. FlashPCA was used for PCA analysis and we adjusted for the first three principal components in 
the interaction analysis (26). A total of 502,933 SNPs were analyzed in the interaction analysis (23). 
In the replication study, a total of 12,651 individuals were genotyped using Affymetrix Array platform on 
404740 SNPs (24). IBD analysis was conducted to remove duplicate samples or close relatives within the

data set. Individuals with genotype call rate less than 0.95 were excluded from the analysis. The 
Structure program was run to infer ancestry origin and 0.8 was used as the cutoff for European-descent 
population inference (27). A total of 8431 samples were included in replication study including 5377 
controls and 3054 patients with NSCLC lung cancer. EIGENSTRAT was run for PCA analysis and we 
adjusted for the first three principal components in the analysis (28). 
Statistical analysis 
We conducted a genome-wide interaction analysis comprising a  discovery stage in which candidate 
SNPs were identified, and then these SNPs were validated in a subsequent replication study using an 
independent set of cases and controls (Supplemental Figure S1)> A two-step analysis strategy was 
adopted in discovery stage: step 1, a genome-wide case-only logistic regression analysis was performed 
to assess the association between each SNP and smoking status using formula (1) (E denotes smoking 
status) using all the discovery data; SNPs with case-only p value less than 0.001 were further submitted 
to step 2 analysis with a standard case-control logistic model as denoted in formula (2) (D denotes 
disease status).

����� ��� � �� � �� � ��� � �� � ������� � �� � ��� � ������� � � �� � ����(2) 
The Bonferroni corrected cutoff p-value in the step 2 case-control analysis was set to 0.05 divided by the 
number of SNPs entering the step 2 analysis. For example, if 500 SNPs had case-only p-value less than 
0.001 then the cutoff p-value in case-control analysis was 0.05/500=1x10-4. The significant candidate 
SNPs following the step 2 test were chosen for further study based on two additional criteria: 1, the 
SNPs have case-control interaction p value less than 0.1 from each of three subsets in discovery data; 2, 
case-control interaction p values less than the Bonferroni corrected p-value from the combined

discovery data. The candidate SNPs were further submitted for verification in replication study. In the 
interaction analysis, SNPs were coded in an additive model (0, 1 or 2). There were three categories of 
reported smoking status, never smoker, current smoker and ex-smoker, in the phenotype data. And ex-
smoker was defined as time since last smoking greater than 2 years. We grouped the samples into never 
smokers (0) and ever-smokers (1, including both current smokers and ex-smokers). The first three 
principal components were adjusted in the interaction analysis.   
The interaction analysis was further stratified by histology subtypes including adenocarcinoma and 
squamous cell carcinoma. For those SNPs validated in replication study (case-control interaction p value 
< 0.05), we also performed a meta-analysis to combine the information from both discovery and 
replication data.  
Genotype imputation 
To increase the density of SNP markers at regions surrounding the significant SNPs verified in replication 
study, we used IMPUTE2 to impute the flanking SNPs in ~250 kb of the three validated SNPs rs6441286, 
rs17723637, and rs4751674 in the discovery data. Because of the limited overlap in SNP panels between 
discovery and replication data, we also conducted imputation to increase the SNP density and overlap in 
the replication data.  The 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 release was used as the reference dataset (29). 
The output dosage file from IMPUTE2 was used as input in logistic regression analysis and the first three 
PCs were adjusted in the imputed genotype analysis.

In discovery study, we first performed the genome-wide interaction analysis to test the association 
between SNPs and smoking behavior using only the lung cancer patients; the samples with p value < 
0.001 were submitted to interaction analysis to test the association between SNP-smoking interaction 
and lung cancer risk using S1-S3 subset as well as the combined data in the discovery stage. Figure 1A-C 
display the Manhattan plot of �log10(p) from the case-only studies including 13336 NSCLC cases, 7015 
adenocarcinoma cases and 4529 squamous cell carcinoma cases, respectively. The QQ-plots displayed 
the observed p-values vs expected p-values, and the observed genomic inflation factor (�� lambda) were 
1.13, 1.06 and 1.00 for NSCLC, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. Since the 
lambda value scales with sample size, we also computed the inflation factor for an equivalent study of 
1000 cases (30). The scaled lambda values were 1.01, 1.01 and 1.00 for interaction analysis in NSCLC, 
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively (Figure 1A-C). No obvious inflation of type I 
error rate was detected in the study. In the association analysis between smoking behavior and SNPs 
using only cases, 1379, 867 and 468 SNPs, including the SNPs at the well-known chr15q24.3�
chr15q25.1 region (the CHRNA5, CHRNA3, CHRNB4, IREB2, PSMA4 gene cluster) with p-value less than 
0.001 were detected in NSCLC, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma case-only interaction 
analysis, respectively (Table S2). And these SNPs entered the step 2 test in discovery stage to test the 
associations between gene-smoking interactions and lung cancer disease using all the cases and controls 
data.  
In step 2 test, the Bonferroni corrected p-values were computed by dividing 0.05 by the number of SNPs 
entered the analysis. And we got 3.63x10-5, 5.77x10-5, 1.07x10-4 for NSCLC, adenocarcinoma and 
squamous cell carcinoma subgroup studies, respectively (Table S2). For consistency, we used 3.5x10-5 as 
the cutoff in step 2 case-control interaction analysis across all the three studies by histology. The 
significant SNPs from step 2 test in discovery stage were chosen based on two criteria: 1, the association

between disease status and gene-smoking interaction has a p vale < 0.1 from each of the S1-S3 subset; 
2, has a p value < 3.5x10-5 from the combined data analysis. For example, 438, 766 and 925 SNPs had a 
case-control interaction p value less than 0.1 from subset 1-3 in NSCLC cohort and 105 of them were 
common to all the three subsets. Among the 105 SNPs, 52 had a case-control interaction p value less 
than 3.5x10-5 using the combined data (Table S2). In adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma lung 
cancer cohort, 41 and 10 SNPs were selected as significant markers for further replication analysis (Table 
S2, S3). 33 and 26 SNPs at chr15q24.3�chr15q25.1 region had significant interaction p-values in 
discovery stage from NSCLC and adenocarcinoma interaction analysis, respectively. The CHRNA5 region 
had been extensively studied in several independent studies (7, 12, 18). However, these p-values were 
much less significant compared with that from main-effect-only association analysis, which means the 
association effect between disease status and SNPs were much more significant when only genetic main 
effect was considered in the model compared with the association effect between disease status and 
gene-smoking interactions (Table S3).  These SNPs on chromosome 15q were not novel SNPs and the 
interaction effect between smoking and SNPs was not as striking as that found in main effect analysis. 
Replication study and meta-analysis 
The replication data came from a separate study so the genotype panel was different from that of 
discovery data. Some of the selected candidate SNPs from discovery study were not available in 
validation data but we still validated the signals at three novel SNPs using genotypes from replication 
data. In the cohort including all NSCLC cases, SNP rs6441286 on chromosome 3q25.33 had a p-value of 
6.30x10-6 in gene and smoking behavior association analysis (step 1) and p-value of 1.16x10-5 in gene-
smoking and disease status association analysis (step 2) using combined discovery data. The step 2 
interaction p-values were 3.39x10-3, 1.67x10-2, and 4.79x10-3 for S1-S3 subset. The replication data 
produced an interaction p-value of 2.02x10-2. The interaction odds ratios (OR) varied from 1.21 to 1.31

across the different subsets and the overall OR was 1.24. This SNP has a p-value of 6.96x10-7 in the 
meta-analysis to combine both the discovery and replication data. rs6441286 was located at the intron 
of IL12A-AS1 gene, which is an antisense RNA regulating IL12 gene, a key regulator in immune response. 
Another validated SNP in NSCLC cohort was SNP rs17723637 located in ZNF462 gene. It had a case-only 
interaction p value of 4.92x10-4 in the gene and smoking behavior association analysis, a gene-smoking 
and disease status association p value of 1.06x10-5 in combined discovery data and p value of 9.76x10-3 
in validation analysis. The interaction ORs were 1.40 (95% CI: (1.09, 1.79)), 1.32 (95% CI: (1.06, 1.64), 
1.45 (95% CI: (1.12, 1.86)), and 1.43 (95%CI: (1.09, 1.88)) for S1-S3 and replication data, respectively. The 
overall interaction OR was 1.37 with p-value of 3.49x10-7 in the meta-analysis.  
In the genome-wide gene-smoking interaction analysis stratified by different tumor subtype, SNP 
rs4751674 had a case-only interaction p-value of 3.69x10-5 and the case-control interaction p-value of 
1.07x10-5 in discovery stage and 2.62x10-2 in replication stage in squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer 
group (Table 2). The interaction ORs were 0.59, 0.54, 0.68 and 0.58 for S1-S3 and replication data, 
respectively. The overall OR was 0.58 from the meta-analysis with a p value of 8.12x10-7. We also 
identified another neighbor rs2244178 with a gene and smoking behavior association p-value of 
2.23x10-4 and gene-smoking interaction and squamous cell lung cancer disease status association p-
value of 3.14x10-5 from combined discovery data analysis. The OR of lung cancer risk associated with 
rs2244178 was 0.58 (95% CI: (0.45, 0.75)). Unfortunately, rs2244178 was not available at the replication

cancer. These interaction effect only achieved genome-wide significance in NSCLC analysis when both 
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients were included in the analysis to get a larger 
sample size (Figure 2A). The interaction effect between SNP rs4751674 and smoking behavior was only 
detected in squamous cell lung cancer subtype. This effect was not existing in adenocarcinoma subtype 
although there were 3293 more samples in adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell group.  
Imputation analysis 
To further verify the replicated interactions between SNPs and smoking behavior, we imputed the 
~250kb flanking regions around each of the three significant SNPs using the genotypes from the 
discovery data to increase the density of markers in the regions harboring the three target SNPs. We 
plotted the signals from 1000 up- and down-stream SNP markers of the target SNPs. Because the 
genotype data for imputation analysis went through additional QC procedures, the final sample size was 
a little smaller than that used in genotype analysis. There were 12624 controls and 12979 NSCLC cases in 
imputed data analysis. In the imputation analysis, we found another eight imputed SNPs with 
interaction p-values less than 3.5x10-5 around rs6441286 and the most significant SNP was rs66785795 
with interaction p value 7.63x10-6 (Table S4 and Figure 1D). All the most significant SNPs were within 
IL12A-AS1 gene. For SNP rs17723637, we found another 6 SNPs with interaction p-values less than 
3.5x10-5 and all the most significant SNPs were within gene ZNF462 which encodes a zinc finger protein 
(Table S4 and Figure 1E). For SNP rs4751674 from interaction analysis in squamous cell lung cancer, we 
detected 14 more SNPs with interaction p-values less than 3.5x10-5 harboring both rs2244178 and 
rs4751674. All of these SNPs were located within the gene AFAP1L2 and the most significant p-value 
came from imputed SNP rs2483911 with a p-value of 2.87x10-6 (Table S4 and Figure 1F). The results from 
imputed genotype analysis strongly supported the identified SNPs in our gene-smoking interactions 
analysis.

Because the SNP panels between discovery and replication data were different and only limited number 
of SNPs were available in both panels, we also imputed the replication genotype data using 1000 
Genome as the reference. We identified another three SNPs with case-control interaction p value < 0.05 
in the imputed replication data. They are rs10477550 on chromosome 5, rs4557740 on chromosome 8 
and rs11544453 on chromosome 22 (Table S3). rs10477550 was located within COMMD10 gene, and it 
has interaction p value of 9.05x10-2, 7.69x10-4, 4.30x10-2 with adenocarcinoma disease in the three 
subsets S1-S3 in discovery data and 4.33x10-3 in the imputed replication data. rs11544453 was within 
WNT7B gene and it has interaction p value of 5.61x10-4, 7.07x10-2, 2.17x10-3 with squamous cell lung 
cancer in three subsets in discovery data and 4.05x10-2 in imputed replication data (Table S3). The 
results from imputed replication data suggest the potential interaction effect with smoking behavior at 
these two genes but direct genotype data would be more reliable for further validation.   
Risk effect of lung cancer at significant SNPs stratified by smoking status 
For the replicated SNPs with significant interactions with smoking status, we further investigated the risk 
effect of the SNPs in smoking and never smoking groups separately. There were 5899 never-smokers in 
the NSCLC cohort and 1399 individuals were NSCLC patients in the never-smokers (Table 1). The minor 
allele at SNP rs6441286 had a protective effect on NSCLC in never smokers and the overall OR was 0.83 
(95%CI: (0.77, 0.90)) when we combined both the discovery and replication data set (Figure 2B). 
However, this protective effect did not exist in samples from only smokers (OR=1.04, 95%CI: (1.00, 
1.07)) in the study combining both discovery and replication data. Similarly, SNP rs17723637 had a 
protective effect on NSCLC in nonsmokers with the overall OR was 0.76 (95% CI: (0.68, 0.85)) in never 
smoking group. No significant effect was identified in the smoking group.

SNP rs4751674 had a negative interaction with smoking behavior in squamous cell carcinoma cohort. 
Among the 4649 never-smokers, only 159 of them were squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer patients. 
SNP rs4751674 had a squamous cell lung cancer risk effect with the overall OR of 1.66 (95%CI: (1.35, 
2.05)) in nonsmokers when we combined both discovery and replication data (Figure 2B). This risk effect 
for lung cancer did not exist in the smoking group (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: (0.94, 1.04)). SNP rs4751674 had a 
risk allele A, and there was no significant difference between the allele frequencies in never-smokers vs 
ever-smokers in controls (OR=1, p value=0.98) (Table S5). In patients with squamous cell lung cancer, 
63.52% of never smokers have at least one risk allele, compared with 45.73% in ever smoker patients 
(OR=2.07, p-value=1.44x10-5). The neighbor SNP rs2244178 had a risk effect with OR of 1.60 (95%CI: 
(1.25, 2.04)) in never-smoker group and no significant effect in ever-smoker group.   
Joint analysis of SNP and smoking behavior in lung cancer 
To better understand the interaction effect between the SNP and smoking status we conducted a joint 
analysis with never smoker without risk allele as the reference group (Table 3). For ever-smokers 
without risk allele group, the NSCLC risk at SNP rs6441286 was 3.51 (95% CI: (3.18, 3.88)); for never-
smokers with risk allele group, the risk was 0.79 (95% CI: (0.70, 0.90)); for ever-smokers with risk allele 
group, the disease risk was 3.66 (95%CIl (3.30, 4.06)). The interaction effect between the risk genotype 
and smoking behavior was 1.33 (95% CI: (1.16, 1.52)). A similar pattern was found at SNP rs17723637. 
For people carrying at least one risk allele, the OR of lung cancer was 0.77 (95% CI: (0.67, 0.88)) in never-
smokers and 3.94 (95% CI: (3.61, 4.30)) in ever-smokers. The interaction between smoking and the SNP 
was 1.38 (95% CI; (1.18, 1.60)). The joint analysis at these two SNPs displayed that for a person who was 
a carrier of the risk allele the lung cancer risk varied dramatically depending on the smoking behavior of 
the person.  Cigarette smoking had a synergetic effect on the risk genotype and abstinence from

smoking among those risk allele carrier population would significantly decrease their risk for NSCLC lung 
cancer. 
For SNP rs4751674 we found that smoking had a very big risk effect for squamous cell lung carcinoma 
which alone contributed an OR of 19.67 (95% CI: (15.08, 25.65). SNP rs4751674 was located at a 
potential tumor gene AFAP1L2 and the risk allele contributed an OR of 1.92 (95% CI: (1.38, 2.67)).  The 
OR was decreased to 19.04 (95%CI: (14.59, 24.85)) when both risk factors occurred which meant that 
smoking behavior had an antagonistic effect on the risk allele and there was a negative interaction 
between the SNP and smoking behavior (OR=0.48 (95% CI: (0.34, 0.67)).  
SNP rs4751674 is located at gene AFAP1L2 (alias: XB130) on chromosome 10 which encodes an adaptor 
protein that participates in many cellular functions including cell proliferation and survival process in 
various cancers (31). AFAP1L2 is a potential oncogene and the knockdown of AFAP1L2 by RNAi was 
associated with induced cell death in human lung cancer cells (32). The results from our statistical 
analysis of SNP rs4751674 suggested that this gene was involved in squamous cell carcinoma in 
nonsmokers.  
Discussion 
Lung cancer has a complicated disease mechanism and both genetic and environmental factors impact 
the disease development. Tobacco smoking is the most important environmental risk factor associated 
with lung cancer. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide gene-smoking behavior interaction 
analysis on NSCLC lung cancer using genotype data from about 36,000 samples including both discovery 
and validation datasets. As far as we know this is by far the largest genome-wide SNP-smoking 
interaction analysis in lung cancer. The three subsets at the discovery stage and independent validation 
data at the replication stage allow us to identify SNPs with consistent effect in interaction analysis across

different data sets and provide solid evidence for interactions between reported SNPs and smoking 
behavior. The GWAS studies are designed for main effect association analysis and have limited power 
for interaction effect detection. We adopted a two-step test for the interaction analysis in discovery 
stage. The case-only interaction analysis at step 1 allowed us to filter the SNPs for further case-control 
interaction analysis at step 2. Based on the number of SNPs in standard interaction analysis at step 2, we 
computed the genome-wide interaction significant level in a conservative way, i.e., 0.05 divided by the 
number of SNPs tested in step2 analysis and we chose 3.5x10-5 as the significance cutoff for all the 
analyses in discovery study. And the candidate SNPs were submitted to replication study using 
independent data set.  
Although the SNPs at the chr15q24.3�chr15q25.1 region passed the significance criteria at gene-
smoking association analysis in case-only study and had a significant interaction effect with smoking 
behavior in disease status association analysis. The interaction effect was much less significant 
compared with the main effect association analysis when no interaction effect was considered. For 
example, rs7163730 and rs11638372, both at chr15q25 region, had a p value of 5.66x10-32 and 5.24x10-25 
in the main effect model, respectively. The interaction p values were only 8.78x10-6 and 1.95x10-5 when 
SNP-smoking interaction was considered in the model (Table S3).  
52, 41 and 10 SNPs were identified from discovery study in NSCLC, ADE and SQC subgroups, 
respectively. Because of the limited overlap in SNP panel between discovery and replication genotype 
data, only 35, 26 and 1 of them were available in the replication genotype data, which limited our ability 
in replication study (Table S2). Three novel SNPs, rs6441286, rs17723637 and rs4751674, were validated 
in the replication analysis with significant interactions with smoking behavior in lung cancer 
development. The gene-smoking interaction and lung cancer disease association p-values from meta-
analysis are 6.96x10-7, 3.49x10-7 and 8.12x10-7 for these three SNPs. The overall ORs combing both

discovery and replication data are 1.24, 1.37 for SNP rs6441286 and rs17723637 in NSCLC, respectively; 
and 0.58 for SNP rs4751674 in squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer. The large sample size in this study 
allow us to identify two SNP-smoking interactions with moderate effect (OR of 1.24 and 1.37). The minor 
alleles C at SNP rs64412866 and G at rs17723637 both have protective effect for NSCLC in never 
smokers but these protective effects are not existing in smokers. SNP rs64412866 is located at gene 
IL12A-AS1 which encodes an antisense RNA of IL12A gene. Antisense RNA is widely transcribed in human 
genome and is an important regulatory mechanism human gene expression (37-38). Studies have shown 
that cigarette smoking affects non-coding RNA, such as microRNA and antisense RNA, expression in 
humans (39-40). One study found that some stress-induced non-coding RNAs were up-regulated by 
exposure to tobacco carcinogen nicotine-derived nitrosamine betone (NNK) in lung cancer and breast 
cancer cell lines (40). Xi et al. found that the exposure of human respiratory epithelial cells and lung 
cancer cells to cigarette smoke increased the expression of micro RNA miR-31 in both these two types of 
cells and overexpression of miR-31 was associated with increased lung cancer risk (39). IL12A encodes 
the subunit of IL12 which has been shown to be a potent cytokine with antitumor activity in human (41). 
Our results suggest smoking behavior interact with IL12A-AS1 gene and increase the risk for NSCLC lung 
cancer in smokers.  The other SNP rs17723637 is located at gene ZNF462, which is a member of zinc 
finger protein transcription factor family in human. The functions of zinc finger proteins in human 
tumorigenesis vary in different cancers and the report about ZNF462 is still quite limited. Studies 
showed that ZNF462 could be involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease development (42). Our 
results suggested it had a protective effect for lung cancer in nonsmokers.   
SNP rs6441286 and rs17723637 are common variants with minor allele frequency of 0.4 and 0.15, 
respectively. The lung cancer risk among individuals carrying the risk allele of each of these two SNPs 
varies drastically by smoking status (OR 0.79 vs. 3.66 at SNP 6441286 and 0.77 vs. 3.94 at SNP 17723637

between never- and ever-smokers, Table 3). The positive interactions between smoking behavior and 
these two SNPs illustrated the adverse effect of smoking behavior in NSCLC development again. The 
results at these two SNPs provided us another evidence that smoking is harmful to our health and 
quitting smoking will greatly reduce the risk for lung cancer in human.  
In the interaction analysis stratified by disease subtype, we identified some significant interaction in 
adenocarcinoma cohort in discovery study but not validated successfully in replication study. In 
squamous cell carcinoma cohort, we found two SNPs, rs2244178 and rs4751674, with p-values less than 
3x10-5 in case-control interaction analysis in discovery study but only rs4751674 were available and 
successfully validated in replication study. The minor allele A at SNP rs4751674 has a strong interaction 
effect with smoking status and the OR is 0.58 in squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer risk evaluation. 
The negative interaction effect between gene and smoking behavior, i.e., tobacco smoking decreases 
the genetic risk for lung cancer disease at a genetic locus, is rare but still existing in lung cancer 
development. For example, Zhang and his colleagues identified the negative interaction between 
rs1316298 and smoking behavior. This SNP has an OR of 1.12 (95% CI: 1.01-1.25) in non-smoking group 
whereas an OR of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71-0.87) is found among smokers (16). SNP rs1316298 is located 
within a potential tumor suppressor gene and close to genes with tumor-related functions as well. The 
SNP rs������� ��� ��� ��������� �� ��� �������� ���� �� �� �������� �������� ����� ��������� In our 
analysis, rs4751674 is located at gene AFAP1L2 (alias: XB130) which is a member of actin filament 
associated protein (AFAP) family. AFAP genes are adaptor proteins and have been shown to be related 
with tumorigenesis in prostate, lung and breast cancer (31-32,43). Study showed that XB130 regulated 
survival, cell cycle, migration and invasion of cancer by interacting with binging proteins (44). Our results 
support its oncogene function in never smokers. Tobacco smoking has a complicated effect in the 
genome including impact on the signaling pathways, gene expression and induced methylation at many

genes (45-48). A study on cadmium, one of the important toxic chemicals in cigarette, showed that 
cadmium suppressed AFAP1L2 gene expression (36). Tobacco smoking may reduce the AFAP1L2 gene 
expression thus reduced its tumorigenesis risk effect in smokers.  
Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung constitutes about 25% to lung cancers and is closely related with 
smoking history (49). In our squamous carcinoma cohort, only 3.51% and 3.99% of the patients are 
never-smokers in the discovery data and replication data, respectively, compared with 15.63% in 
adenocarcinoma cohort (Table 1). The large sample size in the study enabled us to identify the 
significant interactions in never-smoking squamous cell carcinoma patients. However, the sample size in 
squamous cell carcinoma cohort is still limited and there are only 159 and 38 never-smoker patients in 
the discovery and replication cohort, respectively. We are hoping more never-smoker patients will be 
available in the future so these results can be further validated.  
The three SNPs, rs6441286, rs17723637 and rs4751674, identified in our study stratify lung cancer risk 
by smoking behavior. The interaction ORs are 1.24, 1.37 and 0.58 for these three SNPs, respectively. 
rs6441286 and rs17723637 have increased risk effect for lung cancer in ever smokers whereas 
rs4751674 has a protective effect in ever smokers compared with never smokers. These three SNPs can 
be potential biomarkers used to ������� ��� ��������� �� ����� �� ��� ���������� �� ������������ ���� �� 
lung cancer disease by smoking behavior. rs6441286 and rs17723637 have interaction effect with 
smoking behavior in NSCLC development, and rs4751674 only interacts with tobacco smoking in 
squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer. These lung cancer subtype-specific biomarkers will further help us 
categorize the disease risk by tumor histology which is helpful for individualized prognosis and 
prediction of treatment plan.

All the three identified novel SNPs have little evidence for association with lung cancer risk in main-
effect-only association analysis (p values vary from 0.29 to 0.94 in main effect analysis), which displays 
that the gene-environment interaction analysis is an essential approach in exploring the missing 
heritability of lung cancer disease. There are significant gene-smoking interactions at well-known 
chr15q24.3�chr15q25.1 region in lung adenocarcinoma. But the interaction p-values are much less 
significant than that from the main-effect-only association analysis, which suggests the dominant roles 
of the main effect in lung cancer development (Table S3).  The interaction effect at SNP rs4751674 only 
exists in squamous cell carcinoma also suggests the difference of genomic features between squamous 
cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in lung cancer from perspective of gene-smoking interaction 
analysis. This reported study was restricted to Caucasian population and the results may not be 
generalized to other ethnicities because of the different genetic backgrounds. The limited overlap 
between discovery genotype and replication genotype may have reduced the power in our validation 
study. We believe as more genotype data becomes available in the future we can discover more 
important gene-smoking interaction in lung cancer disease.
