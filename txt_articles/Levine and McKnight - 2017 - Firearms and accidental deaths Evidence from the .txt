Firearms and accidental deaths:
Evidence from the aftermath of the
Sandy Hook school shooting
Phillip B. Levine1,2* and Robin McKnight1,2
Exposure to firearms increased substantially after the December 2012 shooting at Sandy
Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and 6 adults were
killed. Gun sales spiked by 3 million, on the basis of the increase in the number of background
checks for firearm purchases. Google searches for buying and cleaning guns increased.
We used Vital Statistics mortality data to examine whether a spike in accidental firearm
deaths occurred at the same time as the greater exposure to firearms. We also assessed
whether the increase in these deaths was larger in those states where the spike in gun sales
per capita was larger. We find that an additional 60 deaths overall, including 20 children,
resulted from unintentional shootings in the immediate aftermath of Sandy Hook.
O
n 14 December 2012, a shooter entered
Sandy Hook Elementary School in New-
town, Connecticut, and killed 20 children
and 6 adults. In the aftermath of this event,
President Barack Obama spoke forcefully
about the need to find ways to reduce the likeli-
hood of such events and made specific proposals
to restrict access to guns (1, 2). As we document
below, that call for new gun control legislation
contributed to a large increase in gun exposure.
Americans displayed greater interest in buying
new guns and in handling their guns. Indeed,
background checks, which are conducted when
a gun is sold by a federally licensed firearms
dealer, spiked during this period. Using these
background-check data as a proxy for gun sales,
we estimated that 3 million additional guns were
sold in the 5 months after the Sandy Hook inci-
dent, beyond the number of sales that would
have otherwise occurred.
After Sandy Hook, President Obama called for
more research on gun violence, which has been
affected since 1997 by changes in funding for the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
National Institutes of Health, and other federal
agencies (3–5). Here we take up that charge, fo-
cusing specifically on the period after the Sandy
Hook school shooting itself.
In particular, we investigated the consequences
of the spike in gun exposure after Sandy Hook,
focusing on the short-term impact on accidental
firearm deaths. Specifically, our analysis asked
whether that spike in exposure was associated
with a simultaneous spike in the number of these
deaths. We went on to consider whether states in
which the spike in exposure was larger experi-
enced greater increases in accidental firearm
deaths. This approach allowed us to overcome
a key empirical challenge that has limited prior
research on this topic: the ability to distinguish
between the causal effect of exposure to firearms
and the effect of other risk factors that are corre-
lated with variation across individuals and over
time in exposure to firearms. In much of our
analysis, background checks for gun sales served
as a proxy for gun exposure.
Greater exposure to guns may plausibly in-
crease the risk of accidents. Previous research has
demonstrated that accidental shootings are more
likely to occur when there are more guns in the
home (6), during routine handling of a firearm
(7), when a gun is not stored properly (8), and
when people are playing with guns or demon-
strating their use (9). Children may be partic-
ularly at risk.
Gun exposure may increase if new guns are
purchased or previously owned guns are removed
from storage. Search data available from Google
provides suggestive evidence that both forms of
exposure increased after Sandy Hook. These data,
available from Google Trends, provide an index
of relative search frequency for specific search
terms over time. Peak search activity for that term,
relative to overall search activity, is assigned a
value of 100, half that amount is assigned a value
of 50, etc. More details on these data, and other
data sources, can be found in (10).
We examined weekly search volumes for the
terms “buy gun” (as in, “where can I buy a gun?”)
and “clean gun” (as in, “how often should I clean
my gun?”) in the United States between 2010 and
2014. We hypothesized that individuals whose
searches included “buy gun” may be more likely
to purchase a new firearm, and individuals whose
searches included “clean gun” may be more likely
to remove a previously owned gun from storage.
Figure 1 shows that the frequency of these
searches spiked immediately after the Sandy
Hook school shooting. We define the “post–Sandy
Hook window” as the December 2012 through
April 2013 period. That window emerges from
our subsequent analysis of background checks
and from the timing of the policy debate that
took place immediately after Sandy Hook. Five

Downloaded from 
 days after the shooting, President Obama spoke
publicly about the need for new gun control leg-
islation. He suggested specific legislative changes
on 16 January 2013 and discussed the proposed
legislation in his 12 February 2013 State of the
Union address. Search activity related to buying
and cleaning guns spiked immediately after each
of these events. Congress debated these changes
until the legislation was voted down on 17 April
2013, at which point this search activity ebbed
and returned to pre–Sandy Hook levels. The
correlation coefficient between these two
search terms is 0.72, indicating a strong po-
sitive relationship between the two types of gun
exposure.
We also documented an increase in gun expo-
sure using data from the National Instant Crimi-
nal Background Check System (NICS), focusing
on the 2008 through 2015 period surrounding
the Sandy Hook shooting. Briefly, the NICS data
provide the number of background checks per-
formed on individuals seeking to purchase a gun
through a licensed dealer, which we use as a proxy
for the number of firearm sales (we use the terms
gun and firearm interchangeably for convenience,
although all of our data represent total firearm
sales). When detrended, these data are highly
correlated with the Google Trends data on “buy
gun” (correlation coefficient = 0.71) described
earlier. Background checks also have been previ-
ously shown to be strongly correlated with other
measures of firearm sales, including tax revenue
from firearm sales, per capita gun ownership, and
the net total of guns manufactured, imported, and
exported (11–13).
Moreover, estimates obtained from the NICS
data are strongly consistent with the findings of
a recent study of complete handgun transaction
records from California’s Department of Justice,
which found that 26,000 additional handguns
were sold in that state in the 6 weeks after Sandy
Hook (14). Using NICS data, we estimated that
33,000additionalhandgunswere soldinCalifornia
in December and January of 2012–2013. Interest-
ingly, although the NICS data do not provide any
information about buyers, the California trans-
action recordssuggest that 59% of the additional
purchases in response to Sandy Hook were made
by first-time firearm buyers.
Figure 2 shows the pattern over time in the level
of gun sales, as proxied by background checks,
after adjusting for seasonality and trends. Each
point on the line represents the deviation from
expected sales. These data show that the spike in
sales emerged immediately after the Sandy Hook
shooting. Sales increased right away, peaked in
January 2013, and remained substantially above
trend through April of that year. These results,
along with the timing of the public discussion
about gun control legislation described earlier,
led us to define the 5-month post–Sandy Hook
window that is the focus of our analysis. No sys-
tematic offsetting declines in sales are evident
in subsequent months, indicating that these in-
creases do not reflect short-term substitution in
the timing of sales. In total, 3 million additional
guns—949 for every 100,000 people in the United
States (the 2013 U.S. population was 316 million)—
were sold during this window. Taken together,
these results, along with our analysis of Google
Trends data, show that exposure to firearms in-
creased substantially in the post–Sandy Hook
window.
The bars in Fig. 2 represent the deviation from
the expected number of children per capita who
died as the result of an accidental shooting over
successive December-through-April windows. The
data for this analysis are drawn from the Vital
Statistics system, which includes every recorded
death in the United States. We used population
data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) program at the National Can-
cer Institute to convert death counts to rates per
100,000 population. The results provide visual evi-
dence of a spike in accidental firearm deaths to
children exactly at the time of the increase in
gun sales after Sandy Hook. Although detrended
accidental deaths per capita exhibit variability
from year to year, no positive spike of that mag-
nitude is observed in any other period. This is
the pattern we would expect to see if those who
purchase guns (and perhaps those who remove
guns from storage) are more likely to succumb
to accidents until those guns are stored in a safer
environment.
We formalized these visual perceptions in our
econometric analysis, separately examining acci-
dental firearm deaths at all ages: among children
(ages 0 to 14) and among adults (ages 15 and
over). We first estimate the following equation
DeathRatemy = b0 + b1SandyHookmy + ϕm +
ϕy + emy
where DeathRatemy is the rate of accidental fire-
arm deaths in the United States per 100,000 popu-
lation in month m and year y and SandyHookmy
represents an indicator variable for the post–
Sandy Hook window. Our regressions include
a full set of year fixed effects (ϕy) to control for
trends and month fixed effects (ϕm) to control
for seasonal patterns. b0 is the intercept and e
is the residual in this specification; the coeffi-
cient of interest is b1. If b1 > 0, this would indicate
that, after controlling for trends and seasonal
fluctuations, the number of accidental firearm
deaths per capita increased during the period af-
ter Sandy Hook.
Table 1 presents the results of this analysis. The
panel “Descriptive statistics” presents descriptive
statistics of deaths and population size for the
relevant age groups that are useful for reference
purposes. The “National data, 2008–2015, ordi-
nary least squares” panel shows the results of
the analysis described above. Our results indicate
that there were an additional 0.0036 monthly

 deaths per 100,000 population overall, including
an additional 0.0058 monthly deaths per 100,000
children and 0.0031 monthly deaths per 100,000
adults. The estimates for all deaths and for those
of children are statistically significant at the 1%
level. The estimates for adults are significant at
the 10% level. This and all subsequent hypoth-
esis tests represent two-tailed Student’s t tests.
With a 2013 population of 61 million children and
256 million adults and a 5-month period of in-
creased firearm sales, these results imply 57 addi-
tional accidental firearm deaths in total (0.0036 ×
3160 × 5, which represents monthly impact on
the death rate × total population in 100,000s ×
number of months in post–Sandy Hook window),
including 18 additional deaths among children
(0.0058 × 610 × 5). These findings represent a
27% increase in such deaths overall, relative to
an average 5-month period, and a 64% increase
among children.
The analysis presented in the “National data,
2008–2015, instrumental variables” panel of
Table 1 uses the same data, but in an instrumental
variables framework. In this framework, we first
created a predicted gun “sales rate” (thousands
of guns sold per 100,000 population) using the
following regression equation:
SalesRatemy ¼ d0 þ d1SandyHookmy þ xmþ
xy þ vmy
This equation includes the same set of month
and year fixed effects (xm, and xy) as before, but
the dependent variable is now the sales rate,
which serves as a proxy for gun exposure. The
d1 indicates the extent to which the sales rate
changed during the post-Sandy Hook window
(d0 is the intercept and v is the residual). We
then use the predicted sales rate (indicated with
a “hat” above SalesRate) from that equation to
estimate the following model (again, with fixed
effects qm and qy, intercept g0 and residual u):
DeathRatemy ¼ g0 þ g1SalesRate
^
my þ qmþ
qy þ umy
This provides an estimate (g1) of the relationship
between the gun sales rate (SalesRatemy) and the
accidental firearm death rate (DeathRatemy).
This model incorporates the assumption that
the mortality rate would not have diverged from
its normal seasonal and yearly patterns during

 this 5-month period if not for the increased fire-
arm exposure that occurred during that time.
The results of this analysis are shown in the
“National data, 2008–2015, instrumental varia-
bles” panel of Table 1. They indicate that an
additional 1000 gun sales per 100,000 popula-
tion were associated with 0.019 additional acci-
dental gun deaths per 100,000 population overall
and 0.030 and 0.016 for children and adults, re-
spectively. These estimates are statistically sig-
nificant at the 1% level overall and for children
and at the 5% level for adults. With an actual
increase in sales of 949 per 100,000 population
in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, this translates
into 57 additional deaths in the total population
(0.019 × 0.949 × 3160, which represents impact
of a 1000 additional gun sales per 100,000 pop-
ulation on the death rate × the size of the esti-
mated sales increase × the total population in
100,000s), including 17 additional deaths among
children (0.030 × 0.949 × 610) and 39 additional
deaths among adults (0.016 × 0.949 × 2560).
We extended this approach to estimate the re-
lationship between gun exposure and accidental
firearm deaths using state-level observations of
the same data sets (15). First, we detrended and
deseasonalized the state-level sales data, as we
did earlier using national data, and calculated the
additional gun sales in each state in the 5-month
window after Sandy Hook. As presented in Fig. 3,
the results show considerable heterogeneity in
the impact of Sandy Hook on firearm sales per
100,000 population across states, ranging from
zero in Maryland to 2500 guns per 100,000 res-
idents in New Hampshire.
In Fig. 4, we separated states into
those whose gun sales rates rose by
more or less than 1000 guns per 100,000
population and display the December-
through-April rate of accidental firearm
deaths among children between 2008
and 2015. This figure mimics the bars
in Fig. 2, except that we distinguish
between states with relatively high–
and low–sales rate increases. The re-
sults show that the spike in children’s
deaths after Sandy Hook was, indeed,
concentrated in those states with
larger increases in per capita gun
sales.
We formalized this analysis using an
instrumental variablesstrategy. We pre-
dicted state-level increases in gun sales
using two variables: (i) the same indi-
cator variable for the Sandy Hook pe-
riod that we used in the national data
analysis and (ii) the interaction be-
tween the Sandy Hook indicator and
the share of the electorate in each state
that voted for Barack Obama in 2012.
The first variable captures the average
increase across all states in the rate of
gun sales in the post–Sandy Hook win-
dow. The second variable captures the
differential impact of Sandy Hook on
gun sales across states. Prior research
has shown that state voting patterns in
presidential elections are correlated with the
prevalence of voter concerns about gun control
legislation(13). States thatmore strongly supported
Barack Obama experienced smaller increases in
gun sales (correlation coefficient = –0.63).
We used the predicted variation in state gun-
sales increases as the key independent variable in
a multivariate regression in which the dependent
variable is the accidental firearm death rate for
each age group. This model also controls for state-
specific month and year indicator variables. The
key assumption of this model is that the share
of Obama voters in a state did not impact that
state’s accidental firearm mortality rate during
this 5-month period, except through its impact
on gun exposure in that state during that period.
The advantage of using this predicted variation
in state gun sales, rather than actual variation, is
that it abstracts from any other variation in gun
exposure that is unrelated to gun-policy concerns
in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, but might also
have an impact on accidental firearm deaths.
More details about this regression model are
available in (10).
The “State data, 2008–2015, instrumental varia-
bles” panel of Table 1 reports results from this
analysis. We estimate that 1000 additional gun
sales per 100,000 population is associated with
0.022 accidental firearm deaths per 100,000 pop-
ulation. The effect among children and adults is
0.038 and 0.018, respectively. These results are
statistically significant at the 5% level overall and
for children and at the 10% level for adults. The
estimates from this model imply that additional
gun exposure after Sandy Hook led to the acci-
dental shooting deaths of 66 people, including
22 children.
We caution against interpreting our results as
representing a direct link between the greater
gun sales and these additional deaths. Gun sales
represent a proxy for gun exposure in our analy-
sis; they are correlated with an increased inter-
est in firearms, even among current gun owners,
as shown in our Google Trends analysis. We
cannot determine the extent to which the im-
pact is driven by sales or greater exposure to
existing guns.
An important attribute of this analysis is the
ability to plausibly distinguish causation from
simple correlation. Simple comparisons of trends
over time, for instance, indicate a negative corre-
lation between gun sales and accidental gun
deaths. Such comparisons, though, do not account
for the presence of other trends that confound
these statistics. The methodology weimplemented
enables us to abstract from these confounding
factors. The focus on spikes in gun sales, whose
timing may be considered random, enables us to
introduce techniques that simulate an experiment.
Unless it happened to be the case that something
else occurred that caused an increase in acciden-
tal firearm deaths at exactly the same time as
Sandy Hook and in those locations where the
gun-exposure spikes were largest, our approach
will have generated causal estimates.
There are several limitations that need to be
taken into consideration in evaluating the results
of our analysis. First, Vital Statistics mortality

 data are known to understate accidental firearm
deaths (16). Mismeasurement in the Vital Statis-
tics data, however, will bias our results only if it is
systematically associated with the spikes in gun
sales, which is unlikely.
A second limitation is that we observe only
those unintentional firearm injuries that result
in death, and our estimates therefore provide a
lower bound on the public health consequences
of spikes in gun exposure. Prior research demon-
strates that the majority of unintentional firearm
injuries do not result in death (17, 18).
A third limitation is that our reported analysis
has focused only on accidental firearm deaths, ig-
noring the potential impact on firearm-related sui-
cides and homicides. Individuals who responded
to concerns about gun control by purchasing or
handling a firearm are unlikely to be motivated
by an intention to kill themselves or others with
those guns. We have also examined these mor-
tality outcomes and found no systematic effect
of the spike in gun sales. This finding is con-
sistent with prior research that analyzed the
short-term impact of increased firearm purchases
due to local gun shows on homicides and sui-
cides and found no evidence of impacts on those
outcomes (19).
A fourth limitation is that our empirical ap-
proach does not allow us to identify any long-
term impact of firearm purchases. The presence
of more firearms in society may alter the likeli-
hood of accidental deaths (or other outcomes) at
any point in time, but we are only able to identify
the short-term impact.
Taken as a whole, our analysis provides evi-
dence indicating that the spike in gun exposure
that followed the Sandy Hook school shooting
increased the incidence of accidental firearm
deaths, particularly among children. Our findings
support the recommendations of the American
College of Preventive Medicine, which include
safe gun-storage laws and physician counseling
of their patients about approaches that can help
reduce deaths associated with the accidental dis-
charge of a firearm (20).
