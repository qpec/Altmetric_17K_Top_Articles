Summary
Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) causes irreversible loss of lung function. People with IPF have 
increased concentrations of autotaxin in lung tissue and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
and exhaled condensate. GLPG1690 (Galapagos, Mechelen, Belgium) is a novel, potent, selective autotaxin inhibitor 
with good oral exposure. We explored the effects of GLPG1690 in patients with IPF.
Methods This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a study done in 17 centres in Italy, Ukraine 
and the UK. Eligible patients were aged 40 years or older, non-smokers, not taking pirfenidone or nintedanib, and had 
a centrally confirmed diagnosis of IPF. We used a computer-generated randomisation schedule to assign patients 1:3 to 
receive placebo or 600 mg oral GLPG1690 once daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were safety (adverse events), 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Spirometry was assessed as a secondary outcome. This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02738801.
Findings Between March 24, 2016, and May 2, 2017, 72 patients were screened., of whom 49 were ineligible and 
23 were enrolled in eight centres (six in Ukraine and two in the UK). Six patients were assigned to receive placebo and 
17 to receive GLPG1690. 20 patients completed the study after one in each group discontinued because of adverse 
events and one in the GLPG1690 group withdrew consent. Four (67%) patients in the placebo group and 11 (65%) in 
the GLPG1690 group had treatment-emergent adverse events, most of which were mild to moderate. The most 
frequent events in the GLPG1690 group were infections and infestations (ten events) and respiratory, thoracic, and 
mediastinal disorders (eight events) with no apparent differences from the placebo group. Two (12%) patients in the 
GLPG1690 group had events that were judged to be related to treatment. Serious adverse events were seen in 
two patients in the placebo group (one had a urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, and lower respiratory tract 
infection and the other had atrioventricular block, second degree) and one in the GLPG1690 group (cholangiocarcinoma 
that resulted in discontinuation of treatment). No patients died. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles 
of GLPG1690 were similar to those previously shown in healthy controls. LPA C18:2 concentrations in plasma were 
consistently decreased. Mean change from baseline in forced vital capacity at week 12 was 25 mL (95% CI –75 to 124) 
for GLPG1690 and –70 mL (–208 to 68 mL) for placebo.
Interpretation Our findings support further development of GLPG1690 as a novel treatment for IPF.

Introduction
Autotaxin is the primary enzyme responsible for the 
production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA),1 which is 
essential for a diverse range of cellular processes. LPA 
and autotaxin have been implicated as key factors in 
several disorders and pathologies.1 Increased autotaxin 
concentrations have been found in lung tissue in people 
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and increased 
concentrations of LPA have been found in bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluid (BALF) and exhaled breath condensate,2,3 
suggesting that the autotaxin-LPA pathway has a 
pathogenic role in this disorder. Autotaxin inhibition 
might be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment 
of IPF.
IPF is characterised by progressive accumulation of 
collagen scar tissue in the lungs that leads to irreversible 
loss of lung function4 and in most patients death due to 
respiratory failure.5 Prognosis is poor,5,6 with 5 year survival 
of 20–30%.5 The cause of IPF remains poorly understood. 
Based on pivotal phase 3 trial results,7–9 the antifibrotic 
treatments pirfenidone and nintedanib received approval 
worldwide for the treatment of IPF. Both agents slow 
disease progression,10,11 but neither stabilises or improves 
lung function, and both therapies have tolerability issues

and substantial discontinuation rates.7–9,12–14 As such, an 
unmet need exists for more effective and better tolerated 
novel therapies.
GLPG1690 (Galapagos, Mechelen, Belgium) is a potent 
and selective inhibitor of autotaxin that in rats has been 
associated with reduced concentrations of LPA C18:2 
species in plasma after oral administration.15 Compared 
with pirfenidone, GLPG1690 was significantly superior 
in reducing the Ashcroft fibrotic score at prophylactic15 
and therapeutic16 doses in mice with bleomycin-induced 
pulmonary fibrosis. An additive inhibitory effect on 
profibrotic mediators was seen in ex-vivo assessment of 
fibroblasts isolated from IPF lung tissue after use of 
combined GLPG1690 and nintedanib.17 A phase 1 first-in-
human study showed that GLPG1690 had good oral 
exposure and was generally well tolerated.18 Plasma 
concentrations of LPA C18:2 decreased with increasing 
concentrations of GLPG1690.18
The evidence implicating autotaxin and LPA in IPF and 
the efficacy and tolerability issues associated with current 
IPF treatments suggest that GLPG1690 could provide a 
novel treatment option for IPF. In this study we aimed to 
assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics of GLPG1690 in people with IPF. We 
additionally explored efficacy, biomarkers, functional 
respiratory imaging, and health-related quality of life.
Methods 
Study design and participants
We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-
group, placebo-controlled, exploratory phase 2a study. We 
recruited patients from 17 clinical study centres in Italy, 
Ukraine, and the UK after a screening period of up to 
4 weeks. Eligible patients were men or women aged 
40 years or older with a diagnosis of IPF based on the 
American 
Thoracic 
Society/European 
Respiratory 
Society/Japanese Respiratory Society/Latin American 
Thoracic guidelines.19 Diagnoses were confirmed by 
central review of high-resolution CT chest scans obtained 
within 12 months before screening and, if available, 
surgical lung biopsy samples. The central review was 
done by an experienced radiologist or pathologist with 
expertise in interstitial lung diseases. Eligible individuals 
had forced vital capacity (FVC) at least 50% predicted, 
diffusing capacity for the lungs for carbon monoxide of at 
least 30% of predicted normal corrected for haemoglobin, 
and FEV1:FVC ratio 0·70 or greater, based on prebroncho-
dilator spirometry. Patients also had to have stable disease 
and a minimum life expectancy of 12 months (judged by 
an investigator). Exclusion criteria included interstitial 
lung disease associated with known primary causes; an 
acute IPF exacerbation within 6 weeks before or during 
the screening period; a lower respiratory tract infection 
requiring antibiotics within 4 weeks before or during the 
screening period; smoking within 3 months before 
screening; a history of lung volume reduction surgery or 
lung transplant; and treatment with pirfenidone, 
nintedanib, or prednisone at a steady dose greater than 
15 mg per day or an experimental IPF therapy 
within 4 weeks before screening (all were prohibited 
throughout the course of the study). Full inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are available in the appendix.
Independent ethics committees at each participating 
site approved the study and it was done in accordance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines. All study participants provided 
written informed consent. The study protocol is available 
in the appendix.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed with the term “idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis” for articles that were published from Jan 1, 2000, to 
Jan 29, 2018, and contained the term in the title or abstract. Of 
the 5443 articles retrieved, 180 were clinical trials. After 
excluding those that listed nintedanib or pirfenidone in the title 
or abstract, 145 articles remained. Among these, multiple 
potential pharmacotherapies for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
(IPF) were discussed, including interferon, immunoglobulin, 
N-acetylcysteine, recombinant human pentraxin-2, 
thrombomodulin, ciclosporin, antibodies against CD20 or 
tumour necrosis factor, octreotide, bosentan, colchicine, 
everolimus, imatinib, lecithinised superoxide dismutase, 
collagen, endothelin-A-receptor antagonists, polymyxin-
B-immobilised fibre, warfarin, heparin, C-C motif chemokine-2 
inhibitors, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, and Feiwei granules. 
The breadth of targets under investigation for these drugs 
highlights the pressing need for novel therapies for the 
treatment of IPF and the interest in this field.
Added value of this study
We believe this study to be unique among IPF clinical trials 
because it reports phase 2 results, including innovative 
endpoints, for a treatment with a novel mechanism of action in 
IPF. This small proof-of-concept study was intended to bridge 
the gap between the early pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic findings for GLPG1690 (Galapagos, 
Mechelen, Belgium) and assess its characteristics in people with 
IPF before moving to larger trials.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results and the previous preclinical and phase 1 data 
support the further development of GLPG1690 for the 
treatment of patients with IPF. Longer-term data will provide 
further insights into the potential of GLPG1690 to address the 
unmet need in the treatment of IPF, including therapies with 
improved tolerability that are able to halt disease progression.

Randomisation and masking
We used a computer-generated randomisation schedule 
created by the contract research organisation (Chiltern 
International Ltd, Slough, UK), using permuted blocks, 
to assign patients in a 1:3 ratio to receive placebo or 
600 mg oral GLPG1690 once daily for 12 weeks. Group 
allocations were obtained via a computerised web-based 
interactive voice response system (Medidata Balance, 
New York, NY, US). Patients and all study personnel were 
masked to treatment assignment. Each GLPG1690 dose 
was given as three capsules (size 00) containing 200 mg 
drug and the placebo was provided as matching capsules. 
At each visit, patients received medication kits containing 
enough doses until the next visit and labelled with the 
allocated randomisation number.
Procedures
Screening was done at the study centres in the 4 weeks 
before random treatment assignment. Enrolled patients 
attended visits on the day before week 1 (baseline), in 
weeks 1 (days 5–9), 2 (day 12–16), 4 (days 25–31), 
8 (days 53–59), and 12 (day 81–87) and 2 weeks after the 
end of treatment (days 95–101). Thus, patients were in 
the study for up to 18 weeks. They took placebo or 600 mg 
GLPG1690 once daily in the morning at home, unless 
attending a study visit when the dose was taken at the 
study centre.
Safety was assessed by monitoring of adverse events 
(including acute IPF exacerbations) and concomitant 
medications throughout the study. At each visit, a 
physical examination and 12-lead electrocardiogram 
([ECG] all visits except baseline) were done, vital signs 
were monitored, and blood and urine samples were 
taken for clinical laboratory tests. Additional blood 
samples were taken for biomarker analysis at baseline, 
before the dose at the week 1, 4, and 12 visits, and at the 
final visit after the end of treatment; for pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic testing at baseline, before the 
dose at the week 1, 2, and 8 visits, and at the final visit 
after the end of treatment; for pharmacokinetic testing 
at 1·5, 4·0, and 6·0 h after the dose at the week 4 visit; 
and for pharmacodynamic testing at 1·5 and 6·0 h after 
the dose at the week 4 visit.
BALF samples were taken via bronchoscopy at 
baseline and after the dose at the week 12 visit. 
Spirometry was done in the study centres at screening, 
baseline, and after the dose during all visits from 
baseline, and at home at baseline and every day after 
the dose. All spirometry tests had to be done at roughly 
the same time (within 1 h) in the morning. Spirometry 
testing at the study sites was done according to the 
acceptability and repeatability criteria of American 
Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guide-
lines20 with the NDD Easy On-PC (TrueFlow) PC-based 
spirometer (New Diagnostic Design Medizintechnik, 
Zurich, Switzerland). The spirometry tests at home 
were done with hand-held devices (EasyOne Air 
spirometer, New Diagnostic Design). All spirometry 
testing was done more than 6·0 h after administration 
of short-acting β agonists or anti 
cholinergics, at least 
12 h after administration of a long-acting bronchodilator, 
and at least 24 h after administration of longer-acting 
agents.
High-resolution CT scans were done at baseline and 
after the dose at the week 12 visit. These were used to 
generate functional respiratory imaging measurements 
to assess specific airway volume and specific airway 
resistance at total lung capacity.
Health-related quality of life was assessed with the 
St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ),21 which 
was completed at baseline and before the dose at the 
week 4, 12, and 14 visits. Patients read and self-completed 
the SGRQ alone. Study staff reviewed the questionnaires 
afterwards to ensure all questions were completed and 
asked patients to complete any missing items.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were the safety and tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GLPG1690. 
We measured concentrations of the study drug in plasma 
with a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
method validated by Galapagos (Romainville, France) 
and did a non-compartmental analysis with Phoenix 
WinNonlin version 6.4 to assess pharmacokinetics. The 
pharmacokinetic parameters were maximum observed 
concentration (Cmax) in plasma, the time at which Cmax 
occurred, trough con 
centration in plasma, and the area 
under the plasma drug concentration–time curve for the 
24 h dosing interval. LPA species for target engagement

were assessed in plasma (LPA C18:2) and BALF (seven 
species; appendix) with an internally qualified liquid 
chroma 
tography tandem mass spectrometry method, 
based on the peak area ratio of the analyte over the internal 
standard LPA C17:0.
Secondary outcomes included pulmonary function 
(measured at the study centre or at home), biomarkers of 
disease activity (including autotaxin, Krebs von den 
Lungen 6/mucin type 1, surfactant protein A and D, 
chemokine motif ligand 18, matrix metalloproteinases 
1 and 7, and markers of extracellular matrix turnover; 
appendix), functional respir 
atory imaging, and health-
related quality of life. Pulmonary function was assessed 
with spirometry, FEV1, FVC, FEV1:FVC ratio, and forced 
expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the exhaled 
volume. We measured biomarkers of disease activity 
before and after treatment. For the functional respiratory 
imaging assessments, we took increased airway volume 
and decreased airway resistance to be signs of disease 
progression. In the assessment of health-related quality of 
life, we took a mean change of 5–8 points on the SGRQ to 
be an important change, as has previously been estimated 
as the minimum important difference in IPF.22
Statistical analysis
We aimed to randomly assign around 24 patients to 
receive GLPG1690 to explore its effect on IPF. We did not 
use strict statistical criteria or a formal sample size 
calculation. Rather, we based the number of patients on 
that judged to allow reasonable estimations of safety, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. We calcul-
ated a retrospective power calculation estimating how 
much of the effect of GLPG1690 on FVC the study was 
powered to detect (appendix).
The safety population included all patients who 
received at least one dose of the study drug or placebo. 
The pharmacokinetic population included all patients 
who received at least one dose of GLPG1690 and for 
whom evaluable pharmacokinetic data were available. 
The pharmacodynamic population included all patients 
who received at least one dose of study drug or placebo 
and had data from at least one pharmacodynamic data 
assessment after baseline. We did secondary efficacy 
analyses in the intention-to-treat population, which 
included all patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug or placebo and had data from one or more 
visits after baseline.
We used SAS version 9.4 for all statistical analyses. 
Safety 
endpoints, 
including 
treatment-emergent 
adverse events, were analysed descriptively. We 
classified adverse events with the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities version 18.1 and graded 
severity as mild, moderate, or severe based on the 
judgment of the investigator. Descriptive statistics were 
calculated with use of derived pharmacokinetic 
parameters. For pharma 
codynamic data, plasma LPA 
C18:2 peak area ratios were summarised descriptively. 
Although we measured Cmax, we did no formal analysis 
of GLPG1690 trough (ie, predose) concentrations to 
assess achievement of steady state. Visual inspection of 
the GLPG1690 trough concentrations in plasma at the 
week 1 visit, however, indicated steady state by the time 
of the first pharmacokinetic assessment. This finding is 
supported by the first-in-human study, in which trough

concen 
trations were established 4 days after the first 
dose.18 We measured the area under the effective-time 
curve over 6 h and the maximum percentage reduction 
from baseline at the week 4 visit, which were determined 
from individual effect–time profiles with the trapezoidal 
summation rule. Absolute values, percentage red-
uctions from baseline, area under the effective-time 
curve, and the maximum percentage reduction from 
baseline were compared between treatment groups 
with an ANCOVA model in which we included disease 
severity (baseline FVC and screening diffusing capacity 
for the lungs for carbon monoxide), age, sex, treatment 
group, country, and baseline values as covariates. We 
used a paired t test to compare absolute values in 
samples taken before the dose and at 1·5 and 6·0 h 
after the dose at the week 4 visit and before the dose at 
the week 12 visit, as well as percentage reductions from 
baseline. BALF LPA peak area ratio reductions from 
baseline were also calculated.
For secondary outcomes, we analysed continuous 
parameters descriptively and compared changes from 
baseline between treatment groups with the same 
ANCOVA model. Because the endpoint analysis was 
prespecified, we made no correction for multiple analyses. 
Comparisons between placebo and GLPG1690 were 
exploratory. Within-group comparisons were done with a 
paired t test. Missing data were imputed, primarily via 
last observation carried forward (LOCF), including for 
patients who discontinued the study early, and we did an 
observed-case sensitivity analysis. For biomarker data, the 
LOCF and observed-case analyses were prespecified, and 
we present the data for the latter. All 95% CIs are 
pointwise.
To maximise the safety and integrity of the study, an 
independent medical safety review was done by an 
independent pulmonologist experienced in IPF (WW). 
This involved regular review of unblinded safety data to 
monitor risks and benefits and to assess any potential 
safety issues arising during the study. This study is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02738801.

Results
Between March 24, 2016, and May 2, 2017, we screened 
72 patients in 17 study centres, 49 of whom were ineligible 
and 23 of whom were enrolled to the study (at six study 
sites in Ukraine and two in the UK). Only two patients 
were screened in Italy and neither met the criteria for 
inclusion. Six patients were assigned to the placebo 
group and 17 to the GLPG1690 group, of whom 
five and 15, respectively, completed the study (figure 1). 
All 23 enrolled patients were included in the safety, 
pharmacodynamic, and intention-to-treat populations. 
16 patients were included in the pharmacokinetic 
population after one patient withdrew from the study 
due to an adverse event before week 1.
Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics 
were similar in the two treatment groups (table 1). The 
median age of the overall study population was 66·0 years 
(IQR 60·0–72·0). All patients were white, and most 
were men. The median body-mass index of the overall 
study population was 28·6 kg/m² (IQR 24·8–35·8). No

patient had received nintedanib or pirfenidone before 
entering the study.
Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 
similar proportions of patients in the placebo and 
GLPG1690 groups (four [67%] and 11 [65%], respectively). 
Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to 
moderate. Two (12%) patients in the GLPG1690 group had 
events that were judged to be related to treatment (table 2). 
The most frequently occurring treatment-emergent 
adverse events are shown in table 3. Two patients in the 
placebo group and one in the GLPG1690 group had at 
least one serious treatment-emergent adverse event: one 
patient in the placebo group had a urinary tract infection, 
acute kidney injury, and lower respiratory tract infection; 
the other patient in the placebo group had atrioventricular 
block (second degree, leading to discontinuation of study 
treatment), haemothorax, and pneumothorax; and the 
patient in the GLPG1690 group had cholangiocarcinoma 
that resulted in discontinuation of study treatment 
(symptoms were noted 1 day after the first intake of study 
drug, but had occurred during screening). No patients 
died or had acute IPF exacerbations.
No clinically relevant findings were seen in the 
laboratory tests, ECG assessments, or measurements of 
vital signs over time in either treatment group.
The median time to Cmax for GLPG1690 was 4·0 h 
(IQR 1·5–4·0). Geometric mean steady-state Cmax was 
4·4 μg/mL (geometric coefficient of variation 104%) and 
the geometric mean area under the drug concentration–
time curve for the 24 h dosing interval was 40 μg/mL per h 
(100%).
Pharmacodynamic analyses showed that concentrations 
of LPA C18:2 in plasma decreased after administration of 
GLPG1690 at the week 4 (figure 2) and week 12 visits and 
that they returned to baseline concentrations at the 
follow-up visit (figure 2). Reductions of LPA C18:2 
concentrations were seen with GLPG1690 in observed 
cases at week 4 (maximum percentage reduction from 
baseline 35·5% for placebo and 89·4% for GLPG1690, 
p=0·0008) and with area under the effective-time curve 
over 6 h (104·1% for placebo and 496·0% for GLPG1690, 
p=0·0007). In BALF, LPA C18:2 and LPA C20:4 concen-
trations were below the level of quantification for more 
than 25% of baseline samples obtained from patients in 
the GLPG1690 treatment group, which prevented 
interpretation. For other LPA species, concentrations 
were low in the two treatment groups with no significant 
difference between them at week 1 (appendix).
Mean FVC measured in the study centres decreased 
over the 12 week treatment period in the placebo group 
but remained similar to or greater than baseline values in 
the GLPG1690 treatment group (mean –70 mL [95% CI 
–208 to 68] in the placebo group and 25 mL [–75 to 124] in 
the GLPG1690 group with LOCF, figure 3). Further 
spirometry data are provided in the appendix. Results 
from observed-case analysis were similar to those with 
LOCF (mean FVC –87·5 mL [95% CI –345 to 170] for 
placebo and 8 mL [–101 to 116] for GLPG1690, appendix). 
The overall patterns of change in FVC assessed by 
spirometry at home were similar to those seen with study 
centre spirometry testing (figure 3).
Among blood biomarkers (appendix) only surfactant 
protein A concentrations showed significant changes, 
with greater increases being seen in the GLPG1690 group 
than in the placebo group. In BALF samples, autotaxin 
was undetectable and changes in total cell count were 
similar in the two treatment groups (appendix).
Mean change from baseline in specific airway volume 
in the observed-case analysis was 3·038 mL/L (95% CI 
0·799 to 5·310) in three patients in the placebo group 
and 0·079 mL/L (–3·722 to 2·631) in 15 in the GLPG1690 
group (p=0·0137). Values for specific airway resistance 
were –0·035 kPa/s (–0·047 to –0·015) in three patients in

The mean change from baseline in total SGRQ score at 
week 12 was similar in the two treatment groups 
(figure 4). For domain scores, mean changes from 
baseline after 12 weeks of treatment were 2·90 units in 
the placebo group versus –5·45 in the GLPG1690 group 
for the symptom domain, 4·14 versus –2·32 units in the 
activity domain, and –3·90 versus 3·22 units in the 
impact domain. 
Discussion
GLPG1690 is the first autotaxin inhibitor to be assessed as 
a treatment for IPF and represents a potential novel 
therapeutic class for this disease. This phase 2a study was 
designed to explore the effects of GLPG1690 in patients 
with IPF, with the aim of subsequently doing a larger 
study of longer duration. Similar proportions of patients 
in the placebo and GLPG1690 groups had treatment-
emergent adverse and serious adverse events and 
laboratory 
parameter 
abnormalities, 
and, 
overall, 
GLPG1690 was well tolerated. No patients had acute IPF 
exacerbations during the study. The pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics of GLPG1690 were similar to 
those previously reported in healthy individuals.18 
Although the study was not designed to investigate 
efficacy, FVC and functional respiratory imaging results 
provided promising preliminary efficacy signals. The 
spirometry results were similar in the two groups 
irrespective of whether they were measured in the study 
centres or at home. Among biomarkers of disease activity, 
we only saw a significant change in concentrations of 
surfactant protein A (in blood) with GLPG1690. Finally, 
health-related quality of life overall did not differ between 
the two treatment groups, although findings for specific 
domains might indicate a beneficial effect with GLPG1690.
The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events 
in the GLPG1690 group were infections and infestations 
(lower respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis) 
and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (cough 
and dyspepsia). The most frequent events with other IPF 
pharmacotherapies are nausea in 36% of patients and rash 
in 28–32% receiving pirfenidone7,8 and diarrhoea in 
62–63% and nausea in 23–26% receiving nintedanib,11 and 
all are probably related to the underlying disease. Of note, 
treatment exposures have been longer in the studies of 
pirfenidone and nintedanib than in this study (>12 months 
vs 12 weeks), although a pooled analysis of nintedanib 
studies showed that 66% and 82% of participants reported 
diarrhoea or nausea, respectively, in the first 92 days of 
treatment.10 Treatment discontinuation data from clinical 
trials are variable and subject to complicating factors, such 
as disease severity and comorbidities, but real-world 
studies seem to support the findings. A US retrospective 
chart review, however, revealed that 21% of patients 
discontinued 
pirfenidone 
and 
26% 
discontinued 
nintedanib, mainly because of gastro-intestinal events.14 
The small number of patients in our study precluded 
comparison of the adverse event profile for GLPG1690 
with that for pirfenidone and nintedanib and, therefore, 
firm conclusions cannot be drawn. 
In exploring the mechanism of action of GLPG1690, we 
found sustained reductions in plasma concentrations of 
LPA C18:2 during treatment that reverted to baseline 
concentrations by the week 14 follow-up visit. Once daily 
dosing with 600 mg GLPG1690 was sufficient to achieve 
this sustained effect, which might translate to a potential 
clinical advantage over current IPF therapies, as 
pirfenidone needs to be taken three times daily after a 
14-day titration period and nintedanib needs to be taken 
twice daily.23,24 Preclinical data for IPF in mice has shown 
target engagement of GLPG1690 with various LPA species 
in BALF.16 In this study, despite robust findings in the 
plasma analysis, the BALF LPA analysis was hindered by 
two species being below the limit of detection and practical 
challenges associated with BALF collection, especially 
dilution caused by the installation of fluid. Additionally,

LPA analysis has several known challenges, including 
variability between assay methods and laboratories. 
Variability is suggested to be due at least partly to LPA 
generation from other lysophospholipids during ex-vivo 
handling and processing. 
25 The method we used aimed to 
minimise interference with LPA measurement, including 
LPA production during sample processing.
The validity of the exploratory FVC findings in the 
GLPG1690 group is supported by the results in the 
placebo group being similar and in line with those seen 
in other clinical trials involving IPF patients. For 
example, the mean decline in FVC from baseline in our 
placebo group at week 12 (–70 mL with LOCF) is similar 
to that at 3 months in pooled analyses of pirfenidone 
(approximately −70 mL)26 and nintedanib (approximately 
−80 mL).27 However, as for the other secondary outcomes, 
this small study was not powered to detect significant 
differences between treatment groups and the data 
should be interpreted with caution. 
Small proof-of-concept studies have strengths and 
limitations but are important for disorders, such as IPF, 
in which the need for more effective therapies remains 
unmet, because they can quickly support or refute the 
potential of new treatment options without unnecessarily 
exposing high-risk patients to investigational therapies 
with limited benefit. This small study was intended to 
bridge the gap between the early pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic findings for GLPG1690 and to assess 
the characteristics of the drug in people with IPF before 
moving to larger trials. Despite the small number of 
patients (particularly in the placebo group) and the short 
treatment duration, our findings provided reassurance 
about the safety of GLPG1690 in patients with IPF. 
Additionally, useful data were generated for target 
engagement, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, 
and we generated some preliminary efficacy findings. 
As is common with small safety studies where the 
expected number of events is unknown, we did not do 
power calculations. Although there is no best method for 
imputation of missing data,28 we used the LOCF method 
for some endpoints, which might have affected efficacy 
findings due to the small number of patients. The 
functional respiratory imaging data should be interpreted 
with some caution due to the small numbers of patients 
who had available serial scans, particularly in the placebo 
group (n=3).
This study combined multiple proof-of-concept endpoints 
with preliminary efficacy assessments. Overall, GLPG1690 
was well tolerated by patients with IPF over 12 weeks, 
showing a similar safety profile to placebo. Pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic findings were consistent with those 
seen in healthy individuals in a phase 1 study,18 and the 
reductions in LPA C18:2 concentrations in plasma 
confirmed target engagement. Although efficacy measure-
ments were secondary endpoints and the study was not 
powered to detect differences between groups for these or 
other endpoints, our data, particularly for FVC, are 
encouraging and support further clinical assessment of 
GLPG1690 as a treatment for IPF.
