Obesity stimulates chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, which is associated with insulin resistance, although the
underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here we showed that obesity-related adipocyte degeneration
causes release of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which promotes macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue via Toll-like
receptor 9 (TLR9), originally known as a sensor of exogenous DNA fragments. Fat-fed obese wild-type mice showed
increased release of cfDNA, as determined by the concentrations of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-
stranded DNA (dsDNA) in plasma. cfDNA released from degenerated adipocytes promoted monocyte chemo-
attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in wild-type macrophages, but not in TLR9-deficient (Tlr9−/−) macrophages.
Fat-fed Tlr9−/− mice demonstrated reduced macrophage accumulation and inflammation in adipose tissue and
better insulin sensitivity compared with wild-type mice, whereas bone marrow reconstitution with wild-type bone
marrow restored the attenuation of insulin resistance observed in fat-fed Tlr9−/− mice. Administration of a TLR9
inhibitory oligonucleotide to fat-fed wild-type mice reduced the accumulation of macrophages in adipose tissue
and improved insulin resistance. Furthermore, in humans, plasma ssDNA level was significantly higher in patients
with computed tomography–determined visceral obesity and was associated with homeostasis model assessment
of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), which is the index of insulin resistance. Our study may provide a novel mechanism for
the development of sterile inflammation in adipose tissue and a potential therapeutic target for insulin resistance.
INTRODUCTION
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in the blood has recently received
much attention as a potential biomarker for monitoring both physio-
logical and pathological conditions (1). Apoptosis and/or necrosis are
considered to be the main source of cfDNA (1–3). Several studies have
reported a link between cfDNA and inflammatory diseases (2–5). Some
of these studies suggested the contribution of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9),
originally known as a sensor of exogenous DNA fragments, to cfDNA-
mediated inflammatory processes (4, 6–9).
Chronic sterile inflammation is central to the pathobiology of
obesity and obesity-related complications. Obesity stimulates chronic
inflammation in adipose tissue, which strongly associates with the devel-
opment of insulin resistance (10), although the underlying mechanism
remains largely unknown (10–14). Adipose tissue is an energy-storing
organ. However, obesity-related conditions, such as higher oxidative
stress (15), lower oxygen pressure (16), and enhanced inflammation (11)
induce cellular degeneration and cause cellular turnover in adipose
tissue (17, 18). A previous study demonstrated the contribution of local
adipocyte-derived factors to multiple pathological states, including adi-
pose tissue inflammation (19). Furthermore, several studies have dem-
onstrated that TLR2 and TLR4 mediate adipose tissue inflammation
through the recognition of fatty acids released from damaged adipocytes
as an internal ligand (20, 21). However, the effects of obesity on cfDNA re-
lease and the role of cfDNA-TLR9 signaling in adipose tissue inflammation
remain unknown. Here, we assessed the hypothesis that cfDNA released by
obesity-related adipocyte degeneration causes adipose tissue inflamma-
tion through recognition by TLR9, contributing to the development of in-
sulin resistance. We examined the association between obesity and the
release of cfDNA, and investigated the role of cfDNA in macrophage ac-
tivationandinthedevelopmentof adipose tissueinflammationandinsulin

tation (BMT) model, and an in vivo TLR9 inhibition study involving wild-
type and TLR9-deficient (Tlr9−/−) mice. Furthermore, we examined
cfDNA level in human plasma to show clinically translatable evidence.

RESULTS
Obesity increases circulating levels of cfDNA
Degeneration of adipocytes occurs in the adipose tissue of obese
subjects (22, 23). Therefore, we examined whether obesity increases
the circulating level of cfDNA in plasma. Fat-fed C57BL/6 (wild-type)
mice showed higher plasma levels of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)

 and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) compared with those fed normal
chow (NC) (Fig. 1, A and B). Plasma level of nucleosomes, a protein-
bound form of circulating cfDNA that is released by the activation of
endonucleases from dead cells (24), was also higher in fat-fed animals
(Fig. 1C). An organ culture experiment showed that epididymal fat
obtained from obese wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet released more
cfDNA compared with that obtained from NC-fed animals (Fig. 1, D
and E). High-fat diet increased plasma ssDNA level, which was asso-
ciated with an increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) weight, but
not liver weight (fig. S1, A and B). Plasma ssDNA level had a positive
correlation with blood glucose level (Fig. 1F and fig. S1C). A high-fat
diet enhanced adipocyte degeneration, as determined by perilipin
expression (22), the number of crown-like structures (23), and elec-
tron micrographic analysis of VAT in this study (Fig. 1G and fig.
S2, A to C).
Obesity increases TLR9 expression in adipose tissue
Increasing evidence suggests that cfDNA serves as an endogenous
ligand for TLR9, contributing to the pathogenesis of several inflam-
matory diseases (4, 6–9, 25), although the role of TLR9 in adipose
tissue inflammation remains unknown. We found that a high-fat diet
increased Tlr9 expression in VAT and that the expression of Tlr9 was
dominant in the macrophage population (Fig. 1, H and I). Electron
microscopic analysis using visceral fat of obese mice showed the

 presence of secondary lysosomes or autolysosomes in the cytoplasm
of macrophages, which are often observed in the vicinity of degener-
ated fat cells (fig. S2D). Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopic
analysis demonstrated accumulation of ssDNA in the cytoplasm of
macrophages accumulated in obese VAT, but not in lean VAT (Fig. 1J).
Adipocyte death initiates and accelerates adipose tissue inflammation,
contributing to the development of insulin resistance (18, 22). There-
fore, we hypothesized that TLR9 in macrophages recognizes cfDNA re-
leased from degenerated adipocytes and promotes inflammation in
adipose tissue.
TLR9 signaling mediates the interaction of adipocytes
and macrophages
First, we examined the roles of TLR9 in the activation of macrophages,
a key player in adipose tissue inflammation. Treatment with CpG-
ODN1826 (CpG1826), a TLR9-specific ligand (26), stimulated the ex-
pression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in peritoneal
macrophages obtained from wild-type mice, but not in macrophages
obtained from Tlr9−/− mice (Fig. 2A and fig. S3). iODN2088, a specific
antagonist of TLR9 (7, 26–29), successfully inhibited MCP-1 expression
induced by CpG1826 in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 2B). As reported
in previous studies (7), CpG1826 ligation to TLR9 activates the nuclear
factor kB (NF-kB) pathway, as determined by the phosphorylation of
IkBa in this cell type (Fig. 2, C and D, and fig. S4).
Next, to investigate whether TLR9 mediates the interaction of mac-
rophages and adipocytes, we cultured peritoneal macrophages using
conditioned media (CM) obtained from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipo-
cytes pretreated with or without tumor necrosis factor–a (TNF-a).
Previous studies demonstrated that TNF-a induces adipocyte degener-
ation (30–32). TNF-a increased the release of cfDNA from adipocytes
into CM in the present study (fig. S5). CM from nontreated adipocytes
increased MCP-1 expression in both wild-type and Tlr9−/− macrophages.
CMfromdegeneratedadipocytesfurtherpromotedMCP-1expression
in wild-type macrophages, although this response was attenuated in
Tlr9−/− macrophages (Fig. 2E). Coculture of macrophages and 3T3-L1
adipocytes using a Transwell membrane showed similar results (Fig. 2F).
CM from degenerated adipocytes or coculture with degenerated adipo-
cytes effectively promoted MCP-1 expression in wild-type macrophages.
Meanwhile, Tlr9−/− macrophages also responded to these culture condi-
tions. Recognition of other cell debris, such as fatty acids, released by
degenerated adipocytes through other Toll-like receptors might be in-
volved in this response. The expression of Tlr2, Tlr4, and Tlr7 did not
differ between wild-type and Tlr9−/− macrophages (fig. S6). To further
investigate whether cfDNA in CM activates macrophages through
TLR9, we stimulated macrophages with cfDNA extracted from adipo-
cyte CM. cfDNA extracted from degenerated adipocyte CM increased
MCP-1 expression only in wild-type macrophages, which was blocked
inthepresenceofiODN2088(Fig.2Gandfig.S7).Theseresultssuggested
that TLR9 activation by cfDNA released from degenerated adipocytes
increased MCP-1 expression in macrophages, which may promote fur-
ther inflammatory responses.
Genetic deletion of TLR9 reduces adipose tissue
inflammation and insulin resistance
To examine the in vivo role of TLR9 in adipose tissue inflammation,
we used a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. After 12 weeks of fat-
feeding, VAT weight was similar between wild-type mice and Tlr9−/−
mice (table S1). Moreover, there was no difference in the level of obesity
between the two strains of mice, compared with their NC-fed counter-
parts (fig. S8), although VAT of Tlr9−/− mice demonstrated reduced
macrophage accumulation and expression of inflammatory molecules,
including MCP-1 and TNF-a, both of which play a pivotal role in the
pathogenesis of insulin resistance, compared withthat of wild-type mice
(Fig. 3, A and B). The expression of the proinflammatory activated
macrophage marker CD11c was lower in Tlr9−/− mice. On the other
hand, the expression of CD206, an alternatively activated macrophage
marker, was higher in Tlr9−/− mice. In addition, VAT of Tlr9−/− mice
showed less NF-kB signal activation, as observed in an in vitro experi-
ment using macrophages (Fig. 3C). On the basis of less inflammation
in VAT, Tlr9−/− mice showed better insulin sensitivity compared with
wild-type mice, as determined by blood glucose level, serum insulin
level, and insulin tolerance test results (Fig. 3D and fig. S9). Plasma lipid
levels, food intake, and indirect calorimetric measurements were sim-
ilar between the two strains of mice (table S1 and fig. S10). The ex-
pression of adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor g
(PPARg), and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), each of which cor-
relateswithinsulinsensitivity, washigherin VAT in Tlr9−/− mice (Fig. 3E).
Genetic deletion of TLR9 improved insulin signaling, as determined
by phosphorylation of IRS-1Ser307 (fig. S11A). Comparison between
NC-fed animals indicated the tendency for Tlr9−/− mice to have better
insulin sensitivity compared with wild-type mice; however, the
difference was not as markedly observed in fat-fed animals (fig. S12A).
Moreover, the expression of genes associatedwithinsulin sensitivity was
similar between the two strains of mice, whereas TNF-a expression in
VAT in NC-fed Tlr9−/− mice was higher than that in NC-fed wild-type
mice (fig. S12B). These results indicated some baseline differences be-
tween Tlr9−/− mice and wild-type mice fed NC; however, our study
clearly demonstrated that TLR9 promotes adipose tissue inflammation
by accelerating macrophage accumulation and activation, contributing
to the development of insulin resistance under a high-fat diet.
TLR9 in bone marrow promotes adipose tissue inflammation
and insulin resistance
To evaluate the potential contribution of TLR9 in bone marrow (BM)
cells to the pathogenesis of adipose tissue inflammation, we reconsti-
tuted the BM of Tlr9−/− mice with that of wild-type mice. Tlr9−/− mice
whose BM cells were replaced by Tlr9−/− BM cells served as control chi-
meric mice. The presence or absence of TLR9 in BM did not affect
metabolic parameters (table S2). BMT reduced body growth as reported
in previous studies (33), although VAT weight was similar to that in
nontransplanted mice in this study (fig. S13). Fluorescence in situ hy-
bridization (FISH) of the X and Y chromosomes in the nuclei, prepared
from spleen and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain re-
action (RT-PCR) detection of Tlr9 in circulating white blood cells, dem-
onstrated that more than 85% of recipient cells were replaced by donor
cells (fig. S14). BM chimeric mice that have TLR9 only in BM cells
showed more macrophage accumulation, higher expression of inflam-
matory molecules, and activation of NF-kB in VAT after a high-fat diet
compared with control chimeric mice (Fig. 4, A to C). In association
with these features of adipose tissue inflammation, BM chimeric mice
that were restored with TLR9 only in BM showed more insulin
resistance and less expression of genes that correlate with insulin sen-
sitivity, compared with control chimeric animals (Fig. 4, D and E, and
fig. S11B). These results suggested that activation of TLR9 in hemato-
poietic cells, at least partially, promotes adipose tissue inflammation and
insulin resistance.

 Administration of TLR9 antagonist attenuates adipose tissue
inflammation and insulin resistance
Results of in vivo and in vitro experiments suggested that TLR9 con-
tributes to insulin resistance by promoting inflammation in VAT.
Therefore, we explored the therapeutic potential of TLR9 inhibition
for obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance.
We administered iODN2088 or its control oligonucleotide to fat-fed
wild-type mice for 11 weeks. TLR9 inhibition with iODN2088 decreased
MCP-1 and TNF-a expression in macrophages obtained by peritoneal
lavage (Fig. 5A). TLR9-blocked mice showed heavier VAT compared
with their controls (table S3); however, these mice showed reduced
accumulation of macrophages in VAT (Fig. 5B). Results of quantita-
tive RT-PCR demonstrated a higher expression of CD11c in VAT in
iODN2088-treated mice, although the expression of TNF-a and the
activation of NF-kB pathways were attenuated in the treated group
(Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, as observed in Tlr9−/− mice, TLR9-
blocked animals showed a better response to insulin and a higher ex-
pression of genes related to insulin sensitivity in VAT (Fig. 5, E and F,
and fig. S11C). These results suggested that in vivo TLR9 blockade
alters the inflammatory milieu by inhibiting macrophage accumulation
and activation in adipose tissue, resulting in improvement of insulin
sensitivity. Moreover, treatment with iODN2088 decreased the plasma
level of triglycerides, albeit with no difference in food intake (table S3).
Plasma level of ssDNA is associated with visceral obesity and
insulin resistance in humans
Finally, we examined the clinical significance of cfDNA using human
plasma samples collected upon medical examination at regional health
checkups. Plasma concentration of ssDNA was significantly higher in
patients with visceral obesity and positively correlated with visceral fat
area (VFA), as determined by computed tomography (Fig. 6, A and B).
Furthermore, plasma concentration of ssDNA positively correlated with

 the marker of insulin resistance, as measured by the homeostasis model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (Fig. 6C). ssDNA was a
significant estimator for HOMA-IR even after correction by other con-
founding factors such as age, C-reactive protein, and VFA (table S4).
This corresponds to the results of our mouse study and suggests that
circulating ssDNA, which is associated with visceral obesity, serves, at
least partially, as an instigator of insulin resistance in humans.
DISCUSSION
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of chronic inflammation in
adipose tissue remains a major medical challenge. We found that obe-
sity is associated with the release of cfDNA into plasma in mice and
humans. Furthermore, results of our in vivo and in vitro experiments
revealed that cfDNA released from degenerated adipocytes promotes
the activation of macrophages, at least partially, via the TLR9 pathway,
leading to the development of adipose tissue inflammation and insulin
resistance.
In adipose tissue, hypertrophy and proliferation of adipocytes, an-
giogenesis, and contribution of immune cells are highly coordinated
(10, 15, 16); however, obesity disrupts this balance, causing apoptosis
and/or necrosis of adipocytes (22, 23). Degenerative changes observed
in obese adipose tissue favor the hypothesis that obesity increases the
release of cfDNA from adipocytes. Here, we demonstrated a higher
ssDNA level in the circulating blood of obese subjects, which was associ-
atedwithVATweightinmiceorVFAinhumans.Theseresultssuggested
that the increase in plasma ssDNA level was associated with fat mass. In

 addition, an in vitro experiment using differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes
showed that TNF-a, an important cytokine associated with obesity-
related insulin resistance, increased cfDNA release from adipocytes
into a culture medium. These results suggested that visceral obesity in-
creases the release of cfDNA.
Recent studies have demonstrated that cfDNA serves as an en-
dogenous ligand for TLR9 (34, 35). Here, we found that macrophages,
a key player in adipose tissue inflammation (12–14), express TLR9.
Therefore, we hypothesized that the cfDNA-TLR9 pathway in macro-
phages contributes to the development of adipose tissue inflammation.
To access this hypothesis in vivo, we used three mouse models. Tlr9−/−
mice clearly demonstrated less inflammation and better insulin sensi-
tivity compared with wild-type mice under a high-fat diet. BMT
experiments demonstrated that Tlr9 deficiency in BM cells played a
protective role in the development of adipose tissue inflammation and
insulin resistance, although these effects were relatively modest com-
pared with non-BMT Tlr9−/− mice because of the limitations of BMT
experiments, such as reduced growth rate and transplantation efficacy
(33). TLR9 expressed in cells other than BM-derived cells might also
play a role. Results of experiments that used a TLR9 inhibitor supported
the concept that TLR9 participates in the development of adipose tis-
sue inflammation. These models convincingly demonstrated that the
cfDNA-TLR9 pathway stimulated macrophage accumulation in adi-
pose tissue and played a pivotal role in the development of adipose
tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Results of our in vitro ex-
periments suggested that cfDNA released from degenerated adipo-
cytes increased MCP-1 expression via TLR9 in wild-type macrophages.
MCP-1 is an important chemoattractant for macrophages toward dead
adipocytes (36). Both macrophages and adipocytes express MCP-1,
although the production of MCP-1 in macrophages causes further
monocyte/macrophage accumulation, accelerating adipose tissue in-
flammation (37). In addition, MCP-1 directly affects adipocyte
function and insulin sensitivity (38, 39). Moreover, increased
CD206 expression and decreased TNF-a expression in VAT were ob-
served in Tlr9−/− mice. Experiments that used BM chimeric mice or a
specific TLR9 inhibitor supported these results. Taken together, the
cfDNA-TLR9 axis is involved in the accumulation and activation of
macrophages, contributing, at least partially, to the development of ad-
ipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance.
While this study was being conducted, Hong et al. (40) reported
that TLR9 deficiency promoted insulin resistance in response to a high-
fat diet, suggesting anti-inflammatory roles for TLR9 in macrophage
activation. Previous studies demonstrated the role of TLR9 in the pro-
inflammatory activation of macrophages related to innate immunity
(7, 9). Our present study is in line with previous evidences on this. Sev-
eral differences in study design, such as diet and duration of feeding,
might cause discrepancies between their study and ours. In addition,
our present study provided evidences that cfDNA released from degen-
erated adipocytes serves as an internal ligand of TLR9, which their study
did not mention.
Compared with previous studies that reported plasma levels of
cfDNA in patients with other inflammatory diseases, including cancer
and systemic lupus erythematosus, the plasma cfDNA level in obese
subjects reported in this study was low (3, 41, 42). The inflammation
observed in obese subjects is more chronic and low grade compared
with other diseases. We speculate that cfDNA level might associate
with the progression of diseases. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated
the relationship between the gut microbiota and metabolic syndrome
(43). These studies suggested the translocation of bacterial components
(such as DNA) and inflammatory factors (including lipopolysaccharide)
in the host circulation under certain circumstances, accompanied by
intestinal epithelium dysfunction caused by obesity or other metabolic
disorders. In our present study, bacteria-specific DNA was not detected
by PCR in plasma cfDNA, as was reported previously (44) (fig. S15),
although we need to take into account DNA fragments originating
from the gut microbiota when we explore the origin of cfDNA.
Further studies are needed to clarify the role of the cfDNA-TLR9 axis
in the development of obesity-related adipose tissue inflammation and
insulin resistance.
Previous studies suggested that obesity-related adipocyte degener-
ation participates in the development of adipose tissue inflammation
and obesity-associated complications (22, 23, 36). Our present study
suggests that the cfDNA-TLR9 axis may participate in this process. In
conclusion, cfDNA released by obesity-related adipocyte degeneration
plays, at least partially, a causal role in the development of adipose
tissue inflammation via TLR9. Our findings shed new insights into
the pathogenesis of adipose tissue inflammation and suggest that
the cfDNA-TLR9 axis might be a potential therapeutic target against
obesity-induced insulin resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal experiments
C57BL/6 mice (wild-type mice) and Tlr9−/− mice (C57BL/6 back-
ground) were purchased from Japan SLC Inc. and Oriental Yeast
Co. Ltd., respectively. Male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD-60;
Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd.) from 8 weeks of age through the completion
of the study.
BMT was performed as described previously (45). Five-week-old
recipient mice were lethally irradiated (total, 9 Gy). On the following
day, unfractionated BM cells harvested from donor mice were injected
into recipient mice via tail-vein injection. At 2 weeks after BMT, all
mice were started on a high-fat diet. Replacement rate after BMT was
determined by FISH of the X and Y chromosomes in male recipient
mice repopulated with female BM. Interphase nucleic slides were pre-
paredfromspleensamplesusingair-drying.FISHanalysiswasperformed
using mouse X and Y chromosome probes (Chromosome Science Labo)
following the manufacturer’s protocol, and the signals were observed un-
der an all-in-one fluorescence microscope (BZ-9000; Keyence Japan). We
used only BM chimeric mice, in which more than 80% of BM had been
replacedbydonorBM.Inaddition,weexaminedtheexpressionofTlr9in
circulating white blood cells using quantitative RT-PCR. Erythrocytes
were removed from heparinized peripheral blood using ACK lysing
buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), and white blood cells were pelleted
and processed for RNA extraction.
For in vivo TLR9 inhibition, phosphothioate-modified oligo-
deoxynucleotides—iODN2088 (5′-tcctggcggggaagt-3′) and negative
control for iODN2088 (5′-tcctgagcttgaagt-3′)—were used (26). These
oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized with a low level of endotoxin
(<0.5 endotoxin units/mg; Gene Design Inc.) and intraperitoneally ad-
ministered to mice (150 mg) three times a week for 11 weeks, starting
from 7 weeks of age.
All mice were housed under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with food
and water available ad libitum. All experimental procedures conformed
to the guidelines for animal experimentation of Tokushima University.

 Human samples
Plasma samples were obtained from 131 subjects (87 men and 44 wom-
en; mean ± SD age, 56 ± 12 years) who fasted overnight and
underwent medical examination at regional health checkups. Pa-
tients who were being treated for hypertension, diabetes, or lipid dis-
order were excluded. Patients with a history of cardiovascular or
cerebrovascular disease, severe hepatic disease, or severe renal disease,
or who were receiving hormone replacement therapy were also ex-
cluded. The study protocols were approved by the local ethical commit-
tees, and written informed consent was obtained. Samples were stored
at −80°C until use.
Extraction of cfDNA
Extraction of cfDNA from adipocyte CM and plasma was performed
using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The concentrations of ssDNA and dsDNA in extracted
cfDNA were measured using QuantiFluor ssDNA System (Promega)
or Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies), respec-
tively, according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Plasma nucleosome
level was also measured using a commercially available kit (Roche).
Cell culture experiments
Thioglycolate-stimulated peritoneal macrophages were collected
from female wild-type mice or Tlr9−/− mice at the age of 8 to 10 weeks
and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum. Isolated peritoneal macrophages were used for ex-
periments 24 hours after plating. Peritoneal macrophages were treated
with CpG1826 or ODN1826 control (InvivoGen)—synthetic oligonu-
cleotides that contain unmethylated CpG—for 4 hours. Peritoneal mac-
rophages were also stimulated with CM or cfDNA obtained from the
CM of 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes for 4 hours. For the in vivo TLR9
inhibition experiment, residential peritoneal macrophages were col-
lected by peritoneal lavage with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and used immediately for analyses.
Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated as previously de-
scribed (46). On day 8, 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes were used for col-
lection of CM. Adipocytes were pretreated with or without TNF-a
(50 ng/ml)under serum-starved conditions for 24 hours, and then cells
were cultured for another 24 hours in a starvation medium without
TNF-a. CM were collected after centrifugation and filtration through a
20-mm mesh to remove cell debris. For Transwell membrane coculture
of macrophages and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a Transwell membrane (pore size,
1 mm) was used. After pretreatment with or without TNF-a for 24 hours,
3T3-L1adipocyteswereculturedinastarvationmediumfor24hourswith-
out TNF-a and then used for coculture with macrophages.
Analysis of metabolic parameters
After a 24-hour fasting, blood sample was collected from the heart
into an EDTA-containing tube. After centrifugation, plasma was
stored at −80°C until the assay. Serum level of insulin (Shibayagi
Co. Ltd.) and plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and free
fatty acids (Wako Diagnostics) were measured using commercially
available kits. Insulin tolerance test was performed after a 4-hour
fasting. Insulin solution (at a dose of 0.75 or 1.0 U/kg) was injected
into the peritoneal cavity as indicated. Indirect calorimetry and
physical activity measurements were performed after 10 to 12 weeks
of high-fat diet. Details of indirect experiments had been described
previously (47).
Fractionation of adipose tissue
Previous papers described the fractionation of adipose tissue (47).
Epididymal fat pads were minced in PBS and incubated with colla-
genase (0.5 mg/ml) on a shaking platform for 40 min at 37°C. The mix-
ture was then passed through a nylon filter (pore size, 250 mm) to
remove undigested material, and the filtrate was centrifuged for 5 min
at 200g and 4°C. Floating cells and pellets were recovered as mature
adipocyte fraction and stromal vascular fraction, respectively.
Histological and immunohistochemical analyses
For tissue harvest, a 0.9% sodium chloride solution was perfused at a
constant pressure via the left ventricle, and then tissues were removed
immediately. Epididymal fat pads were fixed with formalin and em-
bedded in paraffin. Tissues were sectioned serially (5 mm) and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin for general morphological examination.
For immunohistochemical detection of macrophages, sections
were incubated with anti-Mac3 antibody (BD Pharmingen) and stained
using the avidin-biotin complex and ImmPACT DAB Peroxidase Sub-
strate Kit (Vector Laboratories). Each section was counterstained
with hematoxylin. Macrophage accumulation in fat tissue [Mac3-
positive cells (in percentage)] was analyzed using the ratio of the num-
ber of Mac3-positive cells to the number of total cells (total number of
nucleus) (48). For perilipin staining, sections were stained with anti-
perilipin antibody (Abcam) followed by Alexa Fluor 588–conjugated
anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies (Molecular Probes). Nuclei
were counterstained with Hoechst 33258. The sections were mounted
using ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes) and observed under a
confocal microscope (Nikon A1R confocal microscope system; Nikon
Instruments Inc.).
Electron microscopic analysis
For electron microscopy, samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
containing 0.25% glutaraldehyde. Ultrathin sections obtained from em-
bedded Epon blocks were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate
and examined using an electron microscope (Hitachi H-7650).
For immunogold staining, samples were fixed in a 4% paraformal-
dehyde solution including 0.1% glutaraldehyde and 0.05% Triton X-100
and then embedded in glycol methacrylate. Ultrathin (80 to 100 nm)
sections were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.01 M
PBS for 1 hour and rinsed with 0.01 M PBS for 15 min. The sections were
incubated overnight with Anti-Single Stranded DNA (ssDNA) Rabbit
IgG Affinity Purify (1:200 dilution; Immuno-Biological Laboratories
Co. Ltd.) at 4°C. After the sections were washed with 0.01 M PBS, 10-nm
gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (BBInternational) was applied as
secondary antibody for 2 hours at room temperature. The sections were
counterstained with uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate and then
examined under an electron microscope (Hitachi H-7600). As negative
controls for the immunohistochemical procedures, substitution of an
identical concentration of nonimmune IgG for the primary antibody
and direct incubation in colloidal gold without primary antibody were
performed.
Quantitative RT-PCR
cDNA was synthesized from total RNA extracted from tissues and
cells. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed with an Mx3000P
(Agilent Technologies) and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) using gene-specific primers (table S5). Data are
expressed in arbitrary units normalized by b-actin.

 Immunoblotting
Lysates prepared from tissues and cells in a lysis buffer containing a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and a phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Thermo Scientific) were separated with SDS–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis gels. The following antibodies were used: perilipin
(Abcam), IkBa, phospho-IkBa, IRS-1, phospho-IRS-1Ser307 (Cell Sig-
naling), and b-actin (Sigma). Levels of expression were quantified by
densitometry (ImageQuant LAS 4000mini; GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Statistics
For continuous variables, data are expressed as means ± SEM. Compar-
isons between two groups were performed using unpaired Student’s t
test. Comparisons of multiple groups were performed using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey test. Linear regres-
sion analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between two varia-
bles. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
