The RV144 Thai trial HIV-1 vaccine of recombinant poxvirus (ALVAC) and recombinant HIV-1
gp120 subtype B/subtype E (B/E) proteins demonstrated 31% vaccine efficacy. Here we
design an ALVAC/Pentavalent B/E/E/E/E vaccine to increase the diversity of gp120 motifs in
the immunogen to elicit a broader antibody response and enhance protection. We find that
immunization of rhesus macaques with the pentavalent vaccine results in protection of 55%
of pentavalent-vaccine-immunized macaques from simian–human immunodeficiency virus
(SHIV) challenge. Systems serology of the antibody responses identifies plasma antibody
binding to HIV-infected cells, peak ADCC antibody titres, NK cell-mediated ADCC and
antibody-mediated activation of MIP-1b in NK cells as the four immunological parameters
that best predict decreased infection risk that are improved by the pentavalent vaccine.
Thus inclusion of additional gp120 immunogens to a pox-prime/protein boost regimen can
augment antibody responses and enhance protection from a SHIV challenge in rhesus
macaques.

 A
n effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1
vaccine will need to protect against acquisition of
infection. The RV144 phase III HIV-1 vaccine trial in
Thailand (NCT00223080) demonstrated vaccine efficacy of 60.5%
at 12 months (post hoc analysis) that waned to modest protective
efficacy (31.2%) after 42 months and is the only human clinical
trial that has demonstrated protection from HIV-1 acquisition1,2.
The results of the trial were unexpected since previous trials in
the United States and Thailand with related vaccine boost
components failed to protect3,4. A major goal of HIV-1 vaccine
design is to elicit broad and potent neutralizing antibodies
(bnAbs), but bnAbs are rarely made during HIV infection, and to
date, no vaccine has elicited bnAbs5,6. Efforts to define the
correlates of reduced infection risk in RV144 revealed that IgG
antibody responses to the HIV-1 envelope (Env) variable loop 1
and variable loop 2 (V1–V2) epitopes were associated with a
lower risk of infection, as were antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediating IgG antibodies with low IgA
antibodies against Env subunit gp120 (refs 7–10). Genetic
analysis of breakthrough infections revealed that lysine (K) 169
in the V2 was a site of immune pressure, and vaccine efficacy was
48% against viral strains matching this residue11. Thus, increasing
the magnitude and breadth of the V2 antibody response may be a
strategy to improve the efficacy observed in RV144.
The Thai HIV-1 epidemic is dominated by circulating
recombinant
form
CRF01_AE;
however,
subtype
B
and
CRF01_AE/subtype
B
recombinants
are
also
relatively
common12. Most of the CRF01_AE Env is subtype E and
subtype A in the rest of the virus13. The RV144 vaccine
consisted
of
a
canarypox-vectored
(ALVAC-AE;
vCP1521)
prime,
expressing
Gag-Pro
of
HIV
subtype
B;
a
gp41
transmembrane-anchored subtype E gp120 Env (from the
isolate 92TH023) and a bivalent combination of subtypes B
(from isolate MN) and CRF01_AE (from isolate A244) gp120
(AIDSVAX B/E) alum-adjuvanted protein boost1.
In an effort to improve the RV144 vaccine regimen, we
performed a nonhuman primate (NHP) study to compare the
protective efficacy of a pentavalent (subtypes B/E/E/E/E) gp120
protein boost to that of a RV144-like bivalent (B/E) gp120
protein boost following ALVAC-AE prime against a heterologous
neutralization-resistant
(Tier-2)
simian–human
immuno-
deficiency virus (SHIV) challenge. The ALVAC-pentavalent
(B/E/E/E/E) gp120 immunogen included expanded potential
epitope variants in V2 and gp120 epitopes outside of the V2 loop
relative to the ALVAC-bivalent (B/E). The heterologous challenge
virus
we
used
(termed
SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H)
was
a
cloned virus derived from the CCR5-tropic Tier-2 subtype C
SHIV1157ipd3N4 (ref. 14) with three mutations introduced
relative to the parental SHIV to enhance V2 region antibody
recognition. Thus vaccine mediation of decreased transmission
risk seen in this study would be associated with new epitopes
present in the pentavalent B/E/E/E/E vaccine. We determined the
immune correlates of delayed infection risk to inform future pox-
vectored prime, gp120 boost vaccine designs.
Results
Design of a pentavalent gp120 vaccine boost. We analysed
HIV-1 Env sequences from the RV144 trial, including 44 vaccine-
breakthrough infections (infections in the vaccine arm), and
viruses from 66 infected individuals from the placebo group,
in order to select additional Envs that improve HIV Env sequence
coverage in the Thai population and could complement the
bivalent protein component of the RV144 vaccine. Knowing that
there was evidence of protective immune pressure against the V2
region in RV144 (ref. 11), we optimized epitope coverage to this
region rather than the whole Env. A244 and 92TH023, the two
subtype E Envs used in the RV144 trial, are identical in the V2
region. Both of these vaccine antigens were isolated early in the
Thai epidemic (A244 in 1990, 92TH023 in 1992) at a point when
the circulating viruses in Thailand had minimal divergence, but
by the time of the RV144 trial the CRF01_AE virus in Thailand
had diverged considerably (Supplementary Fig. 1A).
We analysed overlapping eight amino acid-long sequences
spanning the V2 region using the mosaic design tool15 and
identified three natural Env sequences (AA058, AA104 and
AA107) from those sampled in the RV144 trial, which in
combination with A244 and 92TH023, provided the best coverage
of the V2 epitope region across all the CRF01_AE RV144 samples
(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1A,B). While the three Envs were
selected for optimal diversity coverage of linear epitopes in the V2
region, by including additional strains in the pentavalent protein
boost we also substantially improved diversity of the full gp120
relative to the original RV144 bivalent boost (Fig. 1a). Not only is
subtype E diversity represented by the RV144 trial samples better
accounted for in the pentavalent vaccine, the pentavalent vaccine
also substantially improved potential epitope coverage of the C
subtype SHIV challenge virus used in this study in both the V2
and across the gp120 (Fig. 1a).
We then immunized two groups (n ¼ 9 per group) of
Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) six times with
108 plaque-forming units of ALVAC-AE (vCP1521) at weeks
0, 4, 13, 21, 47 and 88 and boosted with a either bivalent
(B.63521/AE.A244 gp120) Env protein (Group 1) or pentavalent
(B.63521/AE.A244/AE.AA058/AE.AA104/AE.AA107 gp120) Env
protein (Group 2) at weeks 13, 21, 47 and 88 in GLA-SE adjuvant
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1C). The subtype B Env 63521
was used rather than subtype B MN that was present in the
RV144 vaccine, since it induced robust V1V2 antibody responses
in Rhesus macaques16.
Vaccine-protective efficacy against SHIV challenge. To assess
the protective efficacy of the vaccines, we challenged all animals
beginning at week 90 (2 weeks after the last ALVAC þ protein
immunization) eight times with a weekly intrarectal low-dose
heterologous Tier-2 SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H. Eight unvacci-
nated animals were challenged as the control arm. The V2 region
of the challenge virus was mutated in three positions to optimally
bind RV144 V2 antibodies CH58 and CH59 and V2 bnAbs PG9
and PG16 (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Single genome amplification
of the challenge SHIV stock env sequences revealed that out of 56
env sequences only 5 had 43 nucleotide mutations, which
indicated little sequence diversity of the challenge virus stock
(Supplementary Fig. 1E). After eight challenges, 1 of the 9 (11.1%)
bivalent (B/E) and 5 of the 9 (55.6%) pentavalent (B/E/E/E/E)
vaccinated animals remained uninfected, indicating significant
improvement in protection by the pentavalent vaccine (Fig. 1c;
P ¼ 0.02, Kaplan–Meier (KM) log-rank test). In the control arm,
2 of the 8 (25%) animals remained uninfected at week 11
postchallenge (Fig. 1c; group 2 versus group 3, P ¼ 0.15, KM
log-rank test). Statistical significance was not achieved when
the pentavalent group was compared to control unvaccinated
animals, but when the control and bivalent groups were com-
bined after eight challenges, there was a significant difference
between
the
combined
group
and
the
pentavalent
group
(P ¼ 0.03, KM log-rank test). There was no significant difference
between the vaccinated or control groups in peak viral load or
control of viremia after infection (Fig. 1d,e). Thus the ALVAC-
pentavalent HIV vaccine afforded significantly better protection
against acquisition of infection following repetitive, intrarectal,
SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H challenges than did an ALVAC-bivalent
vaccine regimen.

 Pentavalent vaccine increased binding antibody titres. We
next determined differences in antibody responses between the
bivalent- and pentavalent-vaccinated monkey groups. Binding
antibody responses against the vaccine Env proteins were not
detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after
the ALVAC prime but were detected 2 weeks after the first
protein boost for both groups and increased with subsequent
boosts (Fig. 2a). There was a trend of higher antibody-binding
titres observed prechallenge (week 90) for the pentavalent-
immunized animals against B.63521, A244 and AA058 gp120
proteins used as vaccine immunogens and significantly increased
binding titres for AA104 and AA107 proteins, two of the Envs
only present in the pentavalent vaccine (P ¼ 0.01 for AA104 and
P ¼ 0.008 for AA107, Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test; Fig. 2b).

 We next tested both vaccine groups for antibody binding to V2
peptide regions from all five vaccine Envs. Equivalent levels of
binding antibody were observed for 63521, A244 and AA058 in
the two groups; however, significantly higher antibody titres were
detected for the pentavalent-immunized animals against AA104
and AA107 V2 regions (P ¼ 0.05 for AA104 and P ¼ 0.001 for
AA107, Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test; Fig. 2c). Using compe-
titive ELISA, we observed similar levels of antibodies that could
block CH59, a V2-targeting antibody isolated from an RV144
subject that mediates ADCC17, and CH01, a bnAb that targets
the V1V2-glycan site18, for both vaccine groups (Fig. 2d). The
pentavalent-vaccinated animals had higher levels of antibodies
that blocked monoclonal antibody (mAb) A32 (ADCC-mediating
antibody isolated from an infected individual19) binding to Env
(P ¼ 0.05; Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test) and binding of soluble

Plasma-blocking
antibodies were induced at high titres after the second B/E or
B/E/E/E/E
protein
boost
and
increased
with
subsequent
immunizations (Supplementary Fig. 2A).
Next we characterized plasma IgG antibody-binding responses
at week 90 to HIV-1 linear epitopes covering the full gp160
of HIV-1 Env from seven consensus clades and circulating
recombinant forms (A, B, C, D, group M, CRF01_AE and
CRF02_AG) and six multi-clade vaccine strains. Linear epitopes
within the Env variable loop 3 (V3) region were the dominant
response for both immunization groups against clade B and clade
C strains, but there were additional IgG-binding antibodies that
targeted the C2, V5–C5 and C5 regions in the CRF01-AE clade
(Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 2B,D). Both vaccine groups had
similar antibody-binding patterns and intensities against linear
epitopes across the HIV Env, but the pentavalent group did have
more detectable binding to a peptide region in the C1 for all
clades tested (Fig. 2e). The pentavalent vaccine group had a
higher average percentage of positive peptides for both the
consensus and vaccine HIV linear epitopes, but differences did
not achieve statistical significance (Fig. 2f and Supplementary
Fig. 2C). These results indicated that the both the bivalent and
pentavalent
vaccines
elicited
a
similar
profile
of
binding
antibodies to the HIV-1 Env, but the pentavalent-immunized
animals had improved antibody-binding titres to select Envs
present only in the pentavalent vaccine, including antibodies that
targeted the V2 and CD4-binding site (CD4bs).
Both vaccines elicited mucosal antibody responses. The RV144
vaccine trial consisted of two ALVAC-AE primes followed by two
ALVAC þ protein boosts, and while systemic antibody levels
were determined, analysis of mucosal tissue was not performed.
We performed binding antibody multiplex assays for 12 multi-
clade HIV Env proteins from mucosal IgG antibodies isolated
from rectal wecks taken after the second protein boost at week 23.
We found that all animals had detectable IgG antibodies
in the rectal mucosal at week 23 against at least one of the
tested antigens. Moreover, there was no significant difference
in
antibody-binding
titres
between
the
vaccine
groups
(Supplementary Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that both
vaccines elicited robust mucosal IgG antibody responses.
Vaccine-induced antibodies had multiple effector functions.
Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against seven neutralization-
sensitive Tier-1 viruses were detected by the TZM-bl virus
neutralization assay at week 90 prechallenge, but no neutraliza-
tion was observed for the neutralization-resistant Tier-2 challenge
SHIV (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4A). Both vaccine
groups neutralized six of the seven Tier-1 viruses equally, but
the pentavalent group had significantly higher neutralization
titres against the subtype E NP03 Tier-1 virus (P ¼ 0.006,
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test).
Both vaccine groups had prechallenge antibody titres that
could mediate phagocytosis (antibody-dependent cellular phago-
cytosis (ADCP)) of vaccine Env-coated targets (Fig. 3b,c and
Supplementary Fig. 4B). Equivalent phagocytosis of B.63521 and
A244 was observed for group 1 and group 2, but there was
significantly higher phagocytosis of AA104- and AA107-coated
beads for the pentavalent-immunized group (P ¼ 0.001 and
P ¼ 0.01,
respectively,
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney;
Fig.
3b).
Using a lower cell density to increase assay sensitivity was
required to accurately detect differences in ADCP of the
challenge SHIV. There was significantly higher phagocytosis of
the
SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H
Env-coated
beads
(P ¼ 0.008,
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney; Fig. 3c). These data suggest that
vaccine-induced IgG was functional for engaging monocytes.
Antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD) was
assayed by measuring the deposition of complement component
C3b on the surface of CD4-expressing target cells coated with
A244 gp120. Both vaccine groups had detectable ADCD after the
second protein boost (week 23) where the pentavalent vaccine
trended higher, but prechallenge at week 90 both vaccine groups
had nearly 100% C3b deposition indicating high levels of
ADCD (Supplementary Fig. 4C). Similarly, antibody-dependent
neutrophil-dependent phagocytosis of A244-coated targets was
detected of both vaccine groups (Supplementary Fig. 4D).
Antibody-dependent natural killer (NK) cell activation was
detected by the surface expression of CD107a and intracellular
production of interferon (IFN)-g and macrophage-inflammatory
protein
(MIP)-1b
in
NK
cells
that
had
been
incubated
with plasma antibodies from both vaccine groups and A244
gp120-coated CEM-NKr cells after the last three protein boosts.
Both vaccine groups had antibody-dependent NK cell activation
with the pentavalent vaccine group averaging higher for CD107a,
IFN-g and MIP-1b NK cells prechallenge (Fig. 3d–f).
Non-neutralizing functional ADCC antibody levels were tested
using Tier-2 clade AE CM235 virus-infected CD4 þ T cells for
both vaccine groups before immunization and after the last three
protein boosts. As measured by mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI), pentavalent-immunized animals had higher titres of
antibodies that bound to the surface of virus-infected CD4 þ T
cells at weeks 49 and 90 (P ¼ 0.01 and P ¼ 0.001, respectively;
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test; Fig. 3g). Pentavalent-immunized
animals trended higher for peak ADCC at all three time points
but did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3h). Similarly, the
ADCC titres at peak cell killing for the pentavalent-immunized
animals averaged higher at weeks 49 and 90 (Fig. 3i). Both
bivalent- and pentavalent-immunized animals had ADCC activity
against A244, AA104, AA107 and SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H
gp120-coated target cells but there was no difference in peak
ADCC levels or antibody titres between the two groups
(Supplementary Fig. 4E). These data demonstrate that both
vaccine groups lacked neutralization of the Tier-2 challenge SHIV
before challenge, but the pentavalent group had improved
recognition of Tier-2-infected CD4 T cells and ADCP.
Identification
of vaccine-specific
antibody signatures.
To
broadly profile the vaccine-induced polyclonal antibody response,
we utilized a systems serology approach integrating multiple
diverse prechallenge measurements. Plasma antibody binding
(11 measures), blocking (13 measures), neutralization (7 measures),
ADCP
(5
measures),
NK
cell
surface
marker
expression
(3 measures) and ADCC (13 measures) were all assessed at the
time of challenge (week 90) (Supplementary Fig. 5A). In addition,
Fc characteristics of antigen-specific antibodies (36 antigens,
13
Fc-receptor
detection
reagents)
were
assessed
using
a
customized Fc array assay, and 6 additional Fc-effector functions
(ADCC, ADCP, ADCD and three Ab-dependent NK cell
activities) were assayed at 6 time points throughout the
immunization regimen (Supplementary Fig. 5B,C).
We first sought to profile differences in humoral responses
between the two vaccinated groups using a logistic regression
classifier to identify linear combinations of antibody and
functional activity measurements that robustly distinguish the
groups. Cross-validated classifiers trained on measurements taken
after the initial boost (week 15), at which point the two vaccine
regimens first diverged, achieved near-perfect discrimination
between the two groups (Supplementary Fig. 5D). Perfect
discrimination between groups was observed after the second

 boost (week 23) (Fig. 4a) as well as for the remainder of the study
(Supplementary Fig. 5D), and repeated cross-validation and
permutation testing confirmed the robustness of this classification
approach (Supplementary Fig. 5E). The classifiers identified
measurements
corresponding
to
antibody
activity
against
immunogens present only in the pentavalent vaccine (AA058,
AA104 and AA107) as those crucial for attaining perfect
classification of the animals (final model shown in Fig. 4b,c).
The pentavalent boosting regimen rapidly elicited a broader
response against Env antigenic variants, and over the course
of the vaccination series, these measurements demonstrated
evolving antibody-binding differences between the two groups
(Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5F).
Immune correlates of decreased infection risk. To identify
combinations of antibody and functional activity measurements
predictive of vaccine trial outcome, we performed multivariate
survival analysis with Cox proportional hazard (PH) models
trained on a small set of informative, non-redundant variables.
These prechallenge antibody measurements predicted probability
of infection at each challenge time point, with group-wise
predictions tracking closely to the observed the KM curves
(Fig. 5a). Furthermore, on a per animal basis, predicted risk
of infection was highly concordant with observed time to
infection (cross-validated Concordance index (C-index): 0.85;
P ¼ 1.09e-09)
(Fig.
5b).
Additionally,
the
animals
in
the
pentavalent vaccine group had significantly lower predicted
risk of infection than those in the bivalent vaccine group
(P ¼ 2.76e-03 Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney) (Fig. 5c). Repeated
cross-validation and permutation testing established confidence
in the reliability of these results (Fig. 5d). This risk analysis
uncovered four complementary correlates of decreased risk
of infection: three measuring ADCC (antibody binding to HIV-
infected cells, peak ADCC antibody titre and NK cell-mediated
ADCC) and one measuring antibody-mediated activation of
NK cells by MIP-1b intracellular expression (Fig. 5e and
Supplementary Fig. 6A). Thus multivariate analysis enabled the
discovery of a combination of prechallenge immunological
parameters that captured both the group- and animal-level
differences in the risk of infection.
We next evaluated the potential for the individual prechallenge
immunological parameters to correlate with the number of
challenges required to establish infection in both immunized
groups (Supplementary Fig. 5A). Delayed infection was most
correlated with ADCP of the challenge SHIV, but prechallenge
levels of peak ADCC titres, Env binding, CD4 and CH01 blocking
and infected-cell binding all significantly correlated with time to
infection (Po0.05; Spearman rank correlation; Fig. 5f). Related
antibody parameters also correlated with delayed infection

 (Supplementary Fig. 6B). A combined analysis of all the measures
that had a significant Spearman correlation with delayed infection
revealed that the pentavalent-immunized animals had a sig-
nificantly better composite scores, indicating an overall better
polyfunctional antibody response (Fig. 5g). Finally, we evaluated
six prespecified parameters beginning with prechallenge samples
followed by weekly testing until infection to identify parameters
significantly associated with protection using a Cox PH model.
None of the parameters tested met statistical significance,
most likely due to the small size of the study, but levels of
AA107 Env-binding antibodies were associated with a 55.2%
reduction of infection risk that neared the significance threshold

 (hazard ratio ¼ 0.448; P ¼ 0.0769; Supplementary Fig. 6C). These
data show that the pentavalent vaccine elicited a superior
polyfunctional antibody response when compared to the bivalent
vaccine that resulted in increased protection against SHIV
challenge and immunological parameters associated with titres
of binding antibodies and ADCC correlated with protection.
The pentavalent vaccine-induced memory B-cell repertoire.
Increased antibody titres that blocked CD4 and mediate ADCC
correlated with delayed infection. We sought to isolate antibodies
from the pentavalent vaccine group that had these protective
characteristics. HIV-reactive memory B cells were single-cell
sorted using flow cytometry and immunoglobulin receptor genes
amplified and sequenced from two animals that were immunized
with the pentavalent vaccine at weeks 23 and 49 after the second
and third protein boost, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7A).
Transient recombinant antibody expression and epitope mapping
by ELISA identified 137 antibodies that reacted with HIV gp120
(Fig. 6a). Fifty-one of the antibodies were mapped to specific
regions on the HIV Env, including the CD4bs, C1, V1/V2 and V2
linear epitope. Eight antibodies that target the CD4bs, gp120
epitope or the V1/V2 loop and had the broadest binding to
the
vaccine
immunogens
were
selected
for
further
study
(Supplementary Fig. 7B). All but two antibodies, DH633 and
DH640, reacted with all five vaccine Envs (Fig. 6b). Three
V2-reactive antibodies (DH637, DH638 and DH641) that reacted
strongly with all five vaccine Envs blocked the binding of 697D,
a V2-specific conformation-dependent antibody isolated from an
infected individual (Fig. 6c)20. All three antibodies failed to block
the binding of CH58 and CH59, which target the V2 epitope that
contains lysine (K) 169, indicating a V2 epitope distinct from that
recognized by CH58 and CH59. Moreover, all three antibodies
bound equally to A244 gp120 and A244 K169V mutant Env
(Supplementary Fig. 7C). Additionally, DH637 and DH638
blocked
the
binding
of
the
V2
bnAb
CH01,
suggesting
overlapping epitopes with this bnAb (Fig. 6c). Epitope mapping
of DH637 by linear microarray determined that it recognized
linear peptides from diverse HIV-1 strains that contained the
canonical a4b7 gut mucosal homing receptor interacting site
(LDV)21 (Supplementary Fig. 7D). In addition, DH637 could
inhibit the binding of a4b7 on RPMI8866 cells to a cyclic form of
92TH023 (clade E Env) V2 peptide (Supplementary Fig. 7E).
DH638, DH641 and a gp120-conformational mAb DH640 all
mediated ADCC of CM235-infected CD4 þ T cells (Fig. 6d).
Four antibodies (DH631, DH632, DH633 and DH635) blocked
the binding of CD4 to the Env and were sensitive to mutations
within the CD4bs (Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. 7F). The
four CD4bs, three V2 and gp120 antibodies were tested for
neutralization. All eight antibodies neutralized Tier-1 viruses, but
not the Tier-2 viruses Q168, CM244 and JRFL. Only the CD4bs
antibody DH635 showed weak neutralization of the Tier-2
challenge SHIV (Fig. 6f). DH637 had the broadest neutralization
and DH640 only weakly neutralized 92TH023. Increased titres of
antibodies that bind to Env, mediate ADCC, block CH01 and
CD4 binding and NP03 neutralization all correlated with delayed
time to infection and were higher in the pentavalent vaccine
group (Fig. 5a). Thus the isolated antibodies from pentavalent-
immunized animals have the characteristics of plasma antibodies
that correlated with decreased infection risk.
Discussion
In this study, we aimed to improve the breadth of responses in
RV144 in order to improve vaccine-induced protection beyond
that seen with the bivalent B/E vaccine used in Thailand.
The majority of HIV-1 vaccine candidates tested in rhesus
macaques only demonstrated protection against neutralization-
sensitive viruses and have failed to predict vaccine efficacy when
translated into humans. Here we challenged the animals with a
difficult-to-neutralize (Tier-2) challenge SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H
to determine whether protection could be observed in the
absence of plasma antibody neutralization. We found that
the ALVAC prime/ALVAC-pentavalent protein boost vaccine
regimen afforded significant protection (55.6%) compared with
no protection with an ALVAC-bivalent protein regimen. This
suggests that epitope diversity in the additional Envs selected for
optimal CRF01_AE coverage elicited a protective response in
these animals. However, two of the eight control animals
remained uninfected (25%), and the pentavalent vaccine did
not reach statistical significance when compared to the control
group alone due to the small number of animals in each group
but was significant when the bivalent and control animals were
grouped together. Future studies using pentavalent vaccine
immunogens with larger numbers of animals will be required
to fully determine the protective efficacy.
Both the bivalent and pentavalent vaccines elicited plasma and
mucosal antibodies that bound to multiple epitopes on the HIV-1
Env that mediated neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody
functions, but no neutralization of the neutralization-resistant
(Tier-2) challenge SHIV was observed for either vaccine group.
Similar weak neutralization was observed in the RV144 trial
and this indicated that other immune responses alone or in
combination
mediated
the
moderate
protection
that
was
observed8. An antibody that weakly neutralized the challenge
SHIV, DH635, targeted the CD4bs and was isolated from the
blood of a pentavalent-immunized macaque. It remains possible
that low levels of these types of neutralizing antibodies at the
rectal mucosal could have been involved in protection from
infection.
Other vaccine regimens that mimic the RV144 protocol using
SIV immunogens in rhesus macaques demonstrated partial

 protection22,23,
and
previous
immunization
studies
using
adenovirus vectors and a pox-vectored or Env protein boost
resulted in protection against a neutralization-resistant challenge
SHIV-SF162P3 in non-human primates24–26. Study of humoral
immune responses in previous rhesus macaque challenge studies
suggested that improved protection is due to enhanced functional
vaccine-elicited antibody responses to the HIV Env that work in
combination. Identification of vaccine correlates of protection are
of critical importance to inform future vaccine studies. Systems
serology of antibody responses in our study identified that the
bivalent and pentavalent vaccine arms elicited different antibody
responses. The pentavalent-immunized animals had higher levels
of antibodies that bound and mediated ADCP of AA104 and
AA107 Envs that were only in the pentavalent vaccine and higher
levels of antibodies that bound to the surface of HIV-1-infected
CD4 cells. Multiple individual antibody parameters correlated
with delayed infection, but a combination of three parameters
that measure ADCC (antibody binding to HIV-infected cells,
peak ADCC titres, NK cell-mediated ADCC) and a parameter
that measures antibody-mediated NK cell activation (MIP-1b
intracellular expression) were the best predictors of decreased
infection risk. This indicated that improved ADCC, particularly
HIV-infected
cell
killing
mediated
by
NK
cells,
in
the
pentavalent-vaccinated animals resulted in increased protection
from SHIV acquisition. Larger studies in primates and human
will be required to replicate and confirm these immune correlates
of protection.
While antibody responses to linear V2 peptides were higher in
the pentavalent vaccine group, in the analysis of correlates of
decreased transmission by Cox PH models, increased binding to
AA104 and AA107 V2 peptides missed the significance threshold.
Thus the exact epitope specificities of ADCC-mediating anti-
bodies remains to be determined. However, it is important to note
that we isolated both A32-blockable and V2 antibodies from
RV144 vaccinees that synergized to mediate potent ADCC27.
Moreover,
we
have
isolated
antibodies
from
pentavalent-
immunized macaques that had broad binding to V2 epitopes
and mediated ADCC or could inhibit the binding of a4b7
integrin. During acute HIV infection, CD4 þ T cells that express
high levels of the a4b7 integrin are infected, traffic the virus
to gastrointestinal tissues and lead to formation of persistent
viral
reservoirs28.
Recent
studies
have
demonstrated
that
administration of a4b7-blocking mAbs can protect against SIV
acquisition and can even result in sustained virological control
after antiretroviral therapy29,30. In addition, we isolated a CD4bs
antibody that could weakly neutralize the challenge SHIV.
It is possible that low levels of the a4b7 blocking and
SHIV-neutralizing antibodies could have had a protective effect.
Our immune correlates studies suggest that non-neutralizing
antibodies that mediate ADCC can afford protection against a
Tier-2
SHIV
in
the
absence
of
potent
plasma
Tier-2
neutralization similar to the observations in the human RV144
trial.
Finally, the present findings demonstrated that increasing a
bivalent gp120 Env protein boost to a pentavalent gp120 Env
protein boost that contained additional cross-reactive Env motifs
improved antibody responses and resulted in decreased risk
against acquisition of neutralization-resistant virus in rhesus
macaques. Further studies will be required to determine whether
one or all three additional Envs added to the pentavalent vaccine
are required for the observed improved protection. These data
have implications for future design of pox-vectored vaccine
strategies and suggest that a polyvalent Env mixture may improve
vaccine efficacy. Important differences exist between SHIV
infection in rhesus macaques and HIV-1 infection in humans,
including the limitation that we were only able to assess the
protective efficacy against a single SHIV in rhesus macaques.
Further clinical efficacy studies in humans will be required to
evaluate whether increasing Env diversity in a protein vaccine
correlates with increased efficacy at preventing HIV-1 acquisition.
Methods
Phylogenetic tree. The PHYML program was used31 to create a phylogenetic tree
based on the Env protein alignment from RV144 plus vaccine and challenge
strains. The tree was constructed through the PHYML HIV database interface
(www.hiv.lanl.gov) using an HIVb model, four rate categories and a gamma shape
parameter of 0.31 estimated from the data. The tree was highlighted using Rainbow
Tree (www.hiv.lanl.gov).
Vaccine design and production. Envelope sequences (1672) from 110 individuals
that were infected during the RV144 study, including 44 RV144 vaccinees and 66
placebo recipients (ref. 11; GenBank accession numbers JX446645-JX448316) were
aligned. All samples were collected within a 6-month window from infection.
As we were interested in covering the overall CRF01_AE population diversity in
Thailand, we used a consensus sequence to represent each sample, so each
individual who was represented in our data set only once; the consensus was used
as an approximation of the transmitted founder virus of each infection32. A full
Env protein alignment containing these 110 within-subject consensus sequences,
and also including all relevant vaccine strains and the SHIV challenge virus, is
included as Supplementary Data (RV144-vaccine.fasta). The key V2 epitope region,
between the hypervariable regions V1 and V2 (ref. 33; HXB2 positions 154–184)
was then extracted from the alignment for vaccine antigen selection.
Three natural Env proteins were selected for delivery, based on providing the
best complementary coverage of the V2 region among the RV144 infections, when
added to the original RV144 vaccine antigens. The two CFR01_AE vaccines used in
RV144, A244 and 92TH023, are identical in the V2 region of interest and are
relatively close to the ancestral state of the CRF01_AE founder in Thailand. Three
additional Env proteins (AA058, AA104 and AA107) were selected using the
mosaic tool at the Los Alamos database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov) with settings to
select optimum viruses for coverage from among natural sequences in an
alignment, not to make artificial mosaic proteins15,34. Proteins were selected based
on coverage of contiguous 8-mers; we used 8-mers to capture local co-variation
patterns. The Env consensus sequence from AA058, AA058.con, is identical to the
natural sequence AA058a04R (JX448024); AA107.CON is identical to three natural
Envs from AA107, including AA107.a_wg6 (JX448024); AA104.CON is closest to
AA104.a_RH3 (JX447984) but one base off, so the consensus has an N,
AA104.a_RH3 a D, at HXB2 position 611. B.63521 was chosen as the clade B
component, rather than the MN Env used in RV144, based on superior antigenicity
among tested transmitted/founder Envs35.
The SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H challenge virus was a clone of a heterologous
clade C virus SHIV-1157ipd3N4 (ref. 14), which was mutated in three positions.
Two mutations were introduced after a number of substitutions were tested to see
what was needed to improve sensitivity to neutralization by V2 glycan antibodies.
The mutations Q170K and I192R in combination provided greater sensitivity to
PG9, PG16 and related quaternary-dependent neutralizing antibodies. 192R is a
common amino acid in both the C clade and CRF01_AE, whereas I is very rare.
The third mutation introduced was Y173H; this mutation was introduced
because it enhanced reactivity with RV144 V2 antibodies CH58 and CH59.
Recombinant gp120 proteins B.63521, A244, AA058, AA104 and AA107 were
produced as described17,36. HIV-1 Env V2 peptides (HXB2 positions 165–186;

KVQKEYALFYKLDIVPITN) were produced with an N-terminal biotin conjugated
(CPC Scientific, San Jose, CA).
Immunization and SHIV challenge of rhesus macaques. Twenty-six Indian
origin male and female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were genotyped and
selected as negative for the protective major histocompatibility complex class I
allele Mamu-A*01. Monkeys were housed at New England Primate Research
Center, Southborough, MA or Bioqual, Rockville, MD. The animals were
maintained in accordance with the National Institutes of Health and Harvard
Medical School guidelines and all studies were approved by the appropriate
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Selected animals were randomly assigned to each vaccine arm. Monkeys were
vaccinated by the intramuscular (IM) route with 1 � 108 pfu ALVAC (vCP1521;
Sanofi Pasteur) vector alone twice and then immunized with ALVAC and 100 mg
total purified Env gp120 protein in GLA-SE (IDRI-EM107) adjuvant with the
exception of the last protein boost (week 88), which was 300 mg total protein in
GLA-SE. ALVAC was delivered IM into one leg and the protein was delivered IM
into the other leg. Animals were then challenged eight times weekly by the
intrarectal route with 1:10,000 dilution of our SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H challenge
stock. The virus stock was grown from the infectious molecular clone in rhesus
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the stock was titrated in rhesus

 macaques to select the appropriate dilution. Sequence diversity of the viral stock
was determined by single-genome amplification37.
SHIV plasma viral RNA measurements were performed at the Immunology
Virology Quality Assessment Center Laboratory Shared Resource, Duke Human
Vaccine Institute, Durham, NC as described37.
Antibody binding. Binding of vaccine plasma antibodies and mAbs to HIV-1 Envs
was measured by ELISA in duplicate as described38,39. Binding and linear epitope
mapping of plasma purified IgG or mAbs was performed by peptide microarray.
A single microarray was performed for each animal40,41. Rectal mucosal
IgG-binding responses were measured in duplicate by HIV-specific-binding
antibody multiplex assays and total rhesus macaque custom ELISA. Specific
activity was calculated by dividing the specific binding by the total IgG or IgA
concentration. Positivity criteria were values threefold over the baseline visit
and the cutoff was established using seronegative samples.
Neutralization. Neutralization activities of animal plasma and purified
antibodies were determined by the TZM-bl-cell-based neutralization assay42.
Tier phenotyping of the pseudoviruses was assayed by sensitivity to a pool of
HIV-infected serum as described43. Neutralization assays are performed in
technical triplicate for all animals at each serum time point or antibody
concentration.
ADCC against gp120-coated target cells. The GranToxiLux assay was used to
detect ADCC activities of NHP plasma samples directed against CEM.NKRCCR5
CD4 þ T cells (NIH AIDS Reagent Program Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH from
Alexandra Trkola) coated with recombinant gp120 as described44. ADCC activities
of fourfold serial plasma dilutions starting at 1:100 were measured against cells
coated with gp120 isolates representing vaccine immunogens AA104, AA107 and
A244 and the challenge virus, SHIV1157(QNE)Y173H. Cryopreserved human
PBMCs from an HIV-seronegative donor (Duke University) with the heterozygous
158F/V genotype for Fc-gamma receptor IIIa were used as the source of effector
cells45. Data were reported as the maximum proportion of cells positive for
proteolytically active granzyme B out of the total viable target cell population
(maximum %GzB activity) after subtracting the background activity observed in
wells containing effector and target cells in the absence of plasma. ADCC end point
titres (ADCC titre) were determined by interpolating the dilutions of plasma that
intercept the previously established positive cutoff for this assay (8% GzB activity)
using GraphPad Prism, version 6.0f software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The
percentage of NK-killed gp120-coated targets was evaluated using area scaling
analysis of the GzB þ cells. ADCC assays were performed in duplicate for each
animal at each time point.
ADCC against HIV-1-infected target cells. The ability of NHP plasma samples to
direct killing of CEM.NKRCCR5 cells infected with HIV-1 isolate CM235 (GenBank
accession no. AF259954.1, Agne
`s Chenine, US Military HIV Research Program)
infectious molecular clone virus (IMC) containing a Renilla luciferase (Luc)
reporter gene46 was measured using a Luc-based ADCC assay according to a
modified version of our previously described procedure17,47. Plasma was tested
after fourfold serial dilutions starting at 1:100. Effector cells were the same PBMCs
used for the GranToxiLux assay, stimulated overnight in the presence of media
supplemented with 10 ng ml � 1 IL-15 to activate NK cells48. IL-15 was maintained
in the media throughout the duration of the ADCC assay. Killing was measured as
a reduction in luminescence (Viviren Assay, Promega) compared to that of control
wells containing target and effector cells in the absence of plasma, and the final
results (maximum percentage of specific killing and ADCC Ab titre, which is the
last dilution of plasma above the previously established positive cutoff for this assay
(15% specific killing) are reported after subtracting the baseline activity observed
for samples collected prevaccination. ADCC assays were performed in duplicate for
each animal at each time point.
Plasma binding to the surface of HIV-1-infected cells. Indirect surface staining
was used to measure the ability of NHP plasma samples to bind HIV-1 envelope
expressed on the surface of infected cells using methods similar to those previously
described19. Briefly, mock-infected and CM235-IMC-infected CEM.NKRCCR5 cells
were incubated with 1:100 dilutions of NHP plasma samples for 2 h at 37 �C and
then stained with a vital dye (Live/Dead Aqua) to exclude dead cells from analysis.
The cells were then washed and permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm
solution. Cells were then washed again and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated goat-anti Rhesus IgG (H þ L) polyclonal antisera (Southern
Biotech) to detect binding of the NHP plasma and RD1-conjugated anti-p24
(KC57, Beckman Coulter) to identify infected cells. Cells positive for NHP plasma
binding were defined as live, p24 positive and FITC positive. Final results are
reported as the percentage of FITC-positive cells and FITC MFI among the
p24-positive events after subtracting the background observed for the
prevaccination samples. Assays were performed in duplicate for each animal
at each time point.
Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis assay. Antibody-dependent
phagocytosis was assessed by the measurement of the uptake of antibody-
opsonized, antigen-coated fluorescent beads by the monocytic THP-1 cell line
(ATCC; #TIB-201)49. Briefly, THP-1 cells were purchased from ATCC and
cultured as recommended. Antibody-mediated phagocytosis assay was performed
as described50, with the following modifications. Briefly, 9 � 105 beads (equivalent
of 0.1 ml of supplied suspension) coupled with 63521, A244, AA104, AA107 or
SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H gp120 Env were mixed with 10 ml (25 mg ml � 1 final
concentration) purified rhesus IgG in a 96-well round-bottom plate. After
incubation at 37 �C for 2 h, 5 � 104 ( or 1.25 � 104 for SHIV-1157(QNE)Y173H to
improve sensitivity) THP-1 cells were added to each well with final volume 200 ml
each, then spinoculated at 1,200 g for 1 h at 4 �C. Blocking of CD4 on the cells
was achieved by pretreating the cells at 10 � 106 cells ml � 1 with 20 mg ml � 1
anti-human CD4 antibody (clone SK3) (Biolegend) for 15 min at 4 �C before
adding them to the antibody beads/virus mixture. Following spinoculation,
antigens/viruses and cells were incubated at 37 �C for 1 h to initiate phagocytosis
internalization. Cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Phagocytosis score
was calculated by percentage of cells positive � mean MFI normalized to the
corresponding result for the no-antibody control. A background level of
phagocytosis was determined based on the mean þ 3 s.d. of non-HIV-specific
antibodies. Assays were performed in duplicate for each animal.
Longitudinal antibody analysis. A subset of assays (Supplementary Fig. 5B,C)
were performed on samples from six time points (weeks 2, 6, 15, 23, 49 and 90;
2 weeks post each immunization) throughout the regimen as follows. Assays
performed in technical duplicates for each animal.
Fc array. Fc and Fv characteristics of antigen-specific serum antibodies were
evaluated using a custom, high-throughput, multiplexed array as described
previously26,51. In brief, a panel of recombinant HIV and SHIV proteins were
covalently coupled to fluorescent beads (Luminex). In duplicate, serum samples
were diluted 1:1,000 into a 384-well microplate (Greiner Bio One) containing
B500 beads of each specificity per well. In addition to test samples, pooled positive
and negative purified IgG samples were included. Beads were incubated in
antibodies, washed and subsequently incubated with Fc detection reagents,
including both rhesus52 and human53 FcgRs. Antigens and Fc detection reagents
are listed in Supplementary Fig. 5C. Following incubation, plates were washed and
data were acquired on a FlexMap3D instrument (Luminex). Data were reported as
MFI values. Prior to analysis, Fc Array features were filtered for quality using a
two-step process. First, features were excluded if the correlation between sample
replicates did not exceed 0.7. Second, features whose average did not exhibit both a
greater signal than a negative control sample and an MFI value of 500 were
excluded.
High-throughput Fc functional analysis. IgG was purified from plasma samples
using Melon Gel. All assays performed on all animals in duplicate and values
reported are the average unless noted otherwise.
Antibody-dependent neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis assay. Antibody-
dependent neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis was assessed by the measurement of
the uptake of antibody-opsonized, antigen-coated fluorescent beads by primary
neutrophils26. Biotinylated A244 gp120 was used to saturate the binding sites on
1 mm fluorescent neutravidin beads (ThermoFisher). Excess antigen was removed
by washing the beads, which were then incubated with animal Ab samples
for 20 min at 37 �C. Leukocytes were isolated from blood collected from
HIV-seronegative donors by ACK lysis of red blood cells. Following opsonization,
the freshly isolated leukocytes were added, and the cells were incubated for 1 h
at 37 �C to allow phagocytosis. The cells were then stained for CD66b
(BioLegend #305112; 1 ml per test) to identify neutrophils and fixed, and the
extent of neutrophil phagocytosis was measured via flow cytometry (gating
on CD66b-positive cell) on a Stratedigm S100EXi flow cytometer equipped with
high-throughput sampler. The data are reported as a phagocytic score, which takes
into account the proportion of effector cells that phagocytosed and the degree of
phagocytosis (integrated MFI: frequency � MFI).
Antibody-dependent complement deposition. Ab-dependent complement
deposition was assessed by the measurement of complement component C3b on
the surface of target cells26. CD4-expressing target cells from healthy donors were
pulsed with the A244 gp120 protein (6 mg per million cells) and incubated with
purified Abs. Freshly isolated HIV-negative donor plasma diluted with veronal
buffer and 0.1% gelatin (1:10 dilution) was added, and the cells were incubated for
20 min at 37 �C. The cells were then washed with 15 mM EDTA in PBS, and
complement deposition was detected via flow cytometry following staining for C3b
(Cedarlane #CL7632F; 1 ml per test). Replicates using heat-inactivated donor
plasma were used as negative controls.

 Antibody-dependent NK cell activation. Ab-dependent NK cell degranulation
and cytokine/chemokine secretion was measured using freshly isolated NK cell
responses to plate-bound A244 gp120 (ref. 54). Protein-binding plates were coated
with A244 gp120 (300 ng per well) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.
Plates were then blocked in 5% BSA overnight at 4 �C. Fresh NK cells were isolated
from whole blood from seronegative donors using negative selection with
RosetteSep, as recommended by the manufacturer. Plates were washed to remove
unbound antigen, and sample plasma was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 �C.
Following the incubation, plates were washed to removed un-opsonized antibodies.
Primary NK cells isolated from HIV-seronegative donors were incubated with
anti-CD107a (BD #555802; 2.5 ml per test), brefeldin A (10 mg ml � 1) (Sigma) and
GolgiStop (BD) for 5 h at 37 �C. The cells were then washed and stained for surface
markers using anti-CD16 (BD #557758; 1 ml per test), anti-CD56 (BD #557747; 1 ml
per test) and anti-CD3 (BD #558124; 1 ml per test). The cells were then washed,
fixed and permeabilized using Fix & Perm (Invitrogen) and then stained
intracellularly with anti-IFN-g (BD #340449; 5 ml per test) and anti-MIP-1b
(BD #550078; 1 ml per test). The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
and analysed using flow cytometry. NK cells were defined as CD3-negative and
CD16- and/or CD56-positive. All antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased
from BD.
Group classification. Logistic regression models were developed to distinguish
animals in the two groups according to antibody and functional measurements
(Supplementary Fig. 5A–C). These models were trained using LASSO regularized
logistic regression, seeking relatively sparse sets of measurements whose linear
combinations differentiate the groups. The R package ‘glmnet’55 with default
options was used to evaluate the effect of the regularization parameter (lambda),
and models with lowest training error were selected. To analyse regression
coefficients, a final model was trained using all the samples. To assess the overall
accuracy of the antibody profile-based classification approach, we performed
ninefold cross-validation, ensuring that one sample from each group was included
in each testing set, and computed the balanced accuracy (mean true-positive rate)
on testing set predictions. The robustness of this approach was evaluated by
repeating the cross-validation over random training and testing set splits and by
permutation testing (namely, repeating the same process with randomly shuffled
group labels)56. Classification at each of the four time points after the initial boost
(weeks 15, 23, 49 and 90) was performed using the measurements available at those
time points.
Survival analysis. Models using antibody and functional measurements
(Supplementary Fig. 5A,B) to predict risk of infection for each challenge were
trained using Cox PH regression57, as implemented in the R package ‘survival’58.
Due to the relatively large number of features compared to the number of samples,
which can lead to overfitting of Cox models, aggressive feature-filtering approaches
were employed, both in preprocessing and as part of the model training. Models
were used to predict both animal-level and group-wise risk of infection, and as with
group classification, overall model performance and robustness were assessed using
repeated cross-validation and permutation testing. Representative models were
trained with the most predictive features over the repetitions.
Feature prefiltering. Each feature’s individual ability to predict risk was assessed
in terms of a polyserial correlation coefficient59, a metric estimating correlations
between continuous and discrete variables. The top 25% of features ranked
by coefficient magnitude were retained. In order to obtain a high-quality,
non-redundant subset of these candidates, features were considered in decreasing
order of polyserial coefficient magnitude. Subsequent features that were highly
correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient 40.8) to selected features were
eliminated.
Model training and feature selection. For each fold in the cross-validation, a PH
model was trained by selecting features using greedy backward elimination. First,
an initial full model was trained on the complete set of filtered features. Then,
for each feature, a separate model was trained excluding it, and the feature whose
exclusion yielded the smallest drop in training set likelihood was eliminated. This
procedure was repeated with successively reduced sets of features until either a 40%
drop in likelihood compared to the initial full model was reached or only one
feature was retained.
Animal-level
risk
prediction
and
evaluation.
Since
the
PH
model
is
semiparametric, with the baseline hazard function unspecified, the absolute risk
of an individual animal cannot be estimated. However, its risk relative to the mean
of all animals represents a single assessment that is invariant across the challenge
time points. This relative risk then enables the evaluation of the model’s
performance with the C-index metric60. Higher C-indices indicate better agreement
between the two variables, with a random level of agreement yielding a value of 0.5.
As described for classification, risk was modelled with ninefold cross-validation,
using 100 repetitions to estimate the variation in performance for different random
splits of samples. Performance was compared with that of models trained the same
way but using randomly shuffled challenge data, as in permutation testing.
Representative models. The most predictive features were selected as those
appearing in at least 90% of the 900 PH models obtained over the 100 repetitions of
ninefold cross-validation. These selected features were used to train representative
models for a run of ninefold cross-validation to produce illustrative relative risk
predictions for individual animals. Adding other features with lower frequencies
did not improve the predictive power of the representative models.
Group-wise risk prediction. In addition to predicting the relative risk of infection
of individual animals, a PH model can also be used to estimate the probability of
infection at each challenge point for a test sample. For predicting group-wise risk,
we trained a final model using all the samples, considering the most predictive
features as discussed above for representative models. The survival probabilities for
the bivalent and pentavalent groups were estimated by making predictions on
‘mean’ animals whose measurements represent mean values over the respective
groups. The predicted and observed probabilities for each group were compared
using the log-rank statistic. A high P value of the log-rank statistic provides
stronger evidence for the null hypothesis that the two curves are similar.
Antibody isolation. A244 gp120, A244 V1/V2 tags and B.63521 V1/V2 tag
proteins were tetramerized using fluorescently labelled streptavidin using AF647
(ThermoScientific) and BV421 (Biolegend). PBMCs from rhesus monkeys were
stained with fluorescently labelled antibodies for cell surface markers (BD) and
both fluorescently labelled proteins. Memory B cells (defined as viable singlet CD3
(BD #552852; 2.5 ml per test)/CD14 (BioLegend #301832; 5 ml per test)/CD16
(BD #557744; 5 ml per test) negative, CD20 (BD #347673; 5 ml per test) positive,
surface IgD (Southern Biotech #2030-09; 1 ml per test) negative cells) that were
stained doubly positive for A244 gp120, A244 V1/V2 tags or B.63521 V1/V2 tag
proteins were sorted into single wells of 96-well PCR plates containing reverse
transcriptase–PCR buffer as previously described61. Antibody variable heavy and
variable light genes were amplified using nested PCR and purified and sequenced as
described previously61. VDJ arrangements, clonal relatedness and identification of
the intermediate and unmutated common ancestor were inferred using previously
described computational methods62,63.
Expression of recombinant antibodies. Transient small-scale expression of
antibodies was achieved by assembling VH, VK or VL sequences with linear
cassettes that contain the cytomegalovirus promoter, respective Ig constant region
and poly A signal sequence using overlapping PCR and transfection into 293T cells
as described previously64. Supernatants were directly used to screen for binding of
Env antigens in ELISA.
For production of purified recombinant mAbs, the VH and VL genes were
synthesized (Genscript) and cloned into expression vectors and expressed and
purified as described previously65.
ELISA binding of transiently transfected supernatants and purified recombinant
mAbs was performed as described previously65.
Inhibition of binding of a4b7 by mAbs. Rhesus mAbs at a concentration of 20 or
50 mg ml � 1 in sample buffer were examined using our previously published a4b7
inhibition assay66. Briefly, triplicate wells of a 96-well plate were coated overnight
at 4 �C with MAdCAM-1 (R&D systems #6056-MC-050; 2 mg ml � 1) or
Streptavidin diluted in bicarbonate buffer. The streptavidin-coated plates were then
incubated with biotinylated cyclic 92TH023-V2 peptide for 1 h at 37 �C. The plates
were then blocked with blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 �C followed by the addition of
rhesus mAb DH637 or control mAbs (Ab82 targets influenza and 7B2 targets the
immunodominet region of gp41, all produced recombinantly at Duke) in sample
buffer for 45 min at 37 �C. Plates were washed, followed by the addition of
RPMI8866 cells (Sigma #95041316) that had been preincubated for 45 min at 37 �C
with sample buffer or with sample buffer containing 0.5 mg ml � 1 of mAb ACT-1
(AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program #11718; 5.7 mg ml � 1). Plates were
then incubated for 1 h and washed and the adhered cells were detected by the
addition of AlamarBlue dye. Fluorescence was measured using a M2 plate reader.
Percentage of a4b7 inhibition was calculated by dividing the fluorescence units
from cells incubated with media and mAbs from those incubated with media alone
at the 8 h time point. Two independent experiments in triplicate were performed.
Statistical analysis. The numbers of NHPs for each group in this study have been
determined in consultation with statisticians to be the minimum required for
statistical significant analysis. Investigators were blinded to the vaccine arm of
the samples at the time of assay but were not blinded when analysing the data.
A one-tailed log-rank test was used to evaluate differences between group KM
curves. A Cox PH model with time varying covariate was used for evaluating
potential correlates of protection. Spearman correlations were used to evaluate a
correlation between assay titre at week 90 and the number of weeks to infection.
The PC Composite score is the first principle component of the measures that had
a significant Spearman correlation with weeks to infection. The group comparison
was performed by Exact Wilcoxon. Univariate comparisons were made using exact
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests. All statistical analysis was performed using SAS
v9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). GraphPad Prism version 6.01 was used for
graphical representation.
