Summary
Guidelines are presented for safe practice in the use of intravenous drug infusions for general anaesthesia.
When maintenance of general anaesthesia is by intravenous infusion, this is referred to as total intravenous
anaesthesia. Although total intravenous anaesthesia has advantages for some patients, the commonest
technique used for maintenance of anaesthesia in the UK and Ireland remains the administration of an inhaled
volatile anaesthetic. However, the use of an inhalational technique is sometimes not possible, and in some
situations, inhalational anaesthesia is contraindicated. Therefore, all anaesthetists should be able to deliver total
intravenous anaesthesia competently and safely. For the purposes of simplicity, these guidelines will use the
term total intravenous anaesthesia but also encompass techniques involving a combination of intravenous
infusion and inhalational anaesthesia. This document is intended as a guideline for safe practice when total
intravenous anaesthesia is being used, and not as a review of the pros and cons of total intravenous anaesthesia
vs. inhalational anaesthesia in situations where both techniques are possible.

What other guidelines are available on
this topic?
At the time of writing, there were no nationally or
internationally agreed guidelines on the use of total
intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA).
Why were these guidelines developed?
Surveys of anaesthetists working in the UK and Ireland have
concluded that training in TIVA is currently inconsistent and
often inadequate and that many anaesthetists do not feel
confident when using the technique. The 5th National Audit
Project (NAP5) on accidental awareness during general
anaesthesia found that self-reported cases of awareness were
more common when TIVA was used, but that most of the
cases were preventable and that the commonest contributory
factor was inadequate education and training [1]. The report
recommended that ‘the relevant anaesthetic organisations
should establish a set of standards and recommendations for
best practice in the use of TIVA’. These guidelines have been
produced by the Society for Intravenous Anaesthesia (SIVA)
and the Association of Anaesthetists in response to that
recommendation.
Recommendations
1
All anaesthetists should be trained and competent in
the delivery of TIVA. Schools of Anaesthesia and
training bodies should provide teaching, training and
practical experience of TIVA to all anaesthetic and
intensive care medicine trainees. Consultant and staff
grade, associate specialist and specialty doctor (SAS)
anaesthetists have a responsibility to ensure that they
have the knowledge and skills required to deliver TIVA
competently and safely.
2
When general anaesthesia is to be maintained by
propofol infusion, use of a target-controlled infusion
(TCI) is recommended.
3
Starting
target concentrations
should
be chosen
depending on the characteristics of the patient, co-
administered drugs and clinical situation. Older, frail or
unwell patients may benefit from setting a low initial
target propofol concentration, and making repeated
small incremental increases.
4
Within an anaesthetic department, it is preferable
to stock only one concentration of propofol and
to
dilute
remifentanil
to
a
single,
standard
concentration.
5
The infusion set through which TIVA is delivered
should have a Luer-lock connector at each end, an
antisyphon valve on the drug delivery line(s) and an
anti-reflux valve on any fluid administration line. Drug
and fluid lines should join as close to the patient as
possible
to
minimise
dead
space.
The
use
of
administration sets specifically designed for TIVA is
recommended.
6
Infusion pumps should be programmed only after the
syringe containing the drug to be infused has been
placed in the pump.
7
The intravenous cannula or central venous catheter
through which the infusion is being delivered should,
whenever practical, be visible throughout anaesthesia.
8
Anaesthetists should be familiar with the principles,
interpretation
and
limitations
of
processed
electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. Observation
of the EEG trace and electromyography activity is likely
to improve the clinical utility of the monitoring.
9
Use
of
a
processed
EEG
(pEEG)
monitor
is
recommended when a neuromuscular blocking drug is
used with TIVA.
10
When TIVA is administered outside the operating
room, the same standards of practice and monitoring
should apply as for anaesthesia in the operating room.

 Introduction
When
maintenance
of
general
anaesthesia
is
by
intravenous (i.v.) infusion, this is referred to as TIVA.
Although TIVA has advantages for some patients, and is
the
preferred
technique
of
some
anaesthetists,
the
commonest
technique
used
for
maintenance
of
anaesthesia
in
the
UK
and
Ireland
remains
the
administration
of
an
inhaled
volatile
anaesthetic.
However,
the
use
of
an
inhalational
technique
is
sometimes
not
possible,
for
example,
anaesthesia
delivered outside the operating room, during transfer or
for some operations on the airway. Furthermore, in
some
situations
inhalational
anaesthesia
is
contraindicated, for example, in patients with malignant
hyperthermia,
or
TIVA
may
be
advantageous,
for
example, in patients at high risk of postoperative nausea
and vomiting (PONV) or when intra-operative monitoring
of
somatosensory
or
motor-evoked
potentials
is
required. Therefore, all anaesthetists should be able to
deliver TIVA competently and safely.
The knowledge required by an anaesthetist using TIVA
includes:
1
the principles behind achieving and maintaining an
appropriate plasma and brain concentration of the i.v.
anaesthetic drug;
2
the factors determining the appropriate target drug
concentration to aim for, and how to adjust this in the
light of the patient’s response;
3
practical
aspects
involved
in
ensuring
that
the
intended dose of drug is delivered to the patient;
4
monitoring of the patient receiving TIVA including the
use and interpretation of pEEG monitors.
Achieving a desired drug concentration
in the patient
All
anaesthetists
need
to
know
the
pharmacokinetic
principles underpinning TIVA to be able to achieve and
maintain an appropriate concentration of an i.v. anaesthetic
or analgesic drug in the patient’s plasma and brain.
Achieving a stable plasma concentration of a drug requires
varying drug infusion rates. For example, during induction
and maintenance of anaesthesia, a bolus or rapid infusion
should be followed by a decreasing infusion rate [2, 3]. The
drug concentration achieved in the plasma and brain can
be predicted from pharmacokinetic models (Appendix 1).
Anaesthesia may be induced and maintained either using
manual dosing, where the anaesthetist determines the
bolus dose(s) and infusion rate(s) used, or using a TCI pump
where
the
anaesthetist
enters
the
desired
‘target’
concentration to be achieved in the patient’s plasma or
brain.
Target-controlled infusions
A TCI pump contains a microprocessor programmed with
pharmacokinetic models for relevant drugs. The user
selects the drug and pharmacokinetic model to be used by
that TCI pump and inputs the patient characteristics
(covariates) such as body weight and age, and the target
plasma or ‘brain’ (effect-site) concentration, with the pump
determining the initial bolus and subsequent infusion rates.
The two most commonly used adult propofol models are
Marsh [4] and Schnider [5, 6].
How relevant is the pharmacokinetic model to my
patient?
A pharmacokinetic model is likely to be applicable to
patients with similar characteristics to the subjects in which
it was developed. Most pharmacokinetic models were
developed in young, healthy, non-obese subjects [7];
caution is required when using models in patients whose
characteristics are different (e.g. ASA physical status 3–5,
older patients, obese patients). The Marsh and Schnider
models are most applicable to healthy adults, and the
Kataria [8] and Paedfusor [9] models only to children. The
Eleveld propofol model [10] was developed from a wider
variety of patients, and is suitable for use in children, the
elderly and the obese, but has not yet been incorporated
into commercially available TCI pumps.
Plasma drug concentrations in individual patients are
unlikely
to
be
identical
to
those
predicted
by
the
pharmacokinetic model and displayed by the TCI pump.
The mean difference between estimated and measured
concentrations is usually less than 25% [10], but, if the
patient differs from the population in which the model was
developed, the difference may be considerably greater. In
such circumstances, TCI pumps can be a useful tool for
titrating a propofol infusion to effect (clinical effect or the
desired effect on the EEG as measured by a pEEG monitor),
but the predicted propofol concentration cannot be
assumed to be accurate.
The Association of Anaesthetists and the Society for
Obesity and Bariatric Anaesthesia (SOBA) have published a
guideline which includes discussion of TIVA use in the obese
surgical patient [11]. There is a lack of evidence on whether it
is better to use total body weight or another scalar such as
adjusted body weight when using a TCI pump with these
models
in
the
obese.

 propofol concentrations may not be accurate in the obese.
The maximum body weight accepted by Marsh TCI pumps is
150 kg and pumps using the Schnider model only accept
variables that result in a body mass index (BMI) < 35 kg.m�2
for women or < 42 kg.m�2 for men. When using TIVA in the
obese, titration to clinical effect and pEEG monitoring is
recommended.
Manual infusions
When TIVA is administered manually (i.e. without a TCI
pump), a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetics
of the drugs being used is necessary. A fixed infusion rate
may cause rising, declining or stable concentrations,
depending on prior administration rate and duration of
infusion, leading to a risk of under- or overdosage. It should
be remembered that even when using drugs with the fastest
pharmacokinetic profiles, a simple change in an infusion
rate is associated with a significant delay before plasma
concentrations change appreciably; this lag is even greater
for effect-site concentrations and clinical effect.
On starting a propofol infusion at a fixed rate without an
initial bolus, concentrations rise very slowly and only reach
near steady-state conditions after several hours (Fig. 1). If no
loading dose is given, then administration by fixed infusion
rate
will
be
initially
associated
with
inadequate
concentrations. On the other hand, after some time at a
fixed infusion rate, the concentrations may rise to excessive
levels. Likewise, if the infusion rate is decreased, plasma
concentrations will change slowly. In contrast, remifentanil
achieves around 75% of steady-state concentration after
5 min, with 100% reached after 15–20 min. Examples of
manual infusion protocols for propofol and remifentanil can
be found in Appendix 1.
Choosing an appropriate target drug
concentration for a patient
A clinical calibration of the individual patient’s response to
propofol is recommended during induction and maintenance
of anaesthesia. The drug concentration achieved should be
sufficient to produce loss of consciousness and prevent
movement in response to noxious stimuli. However, the
concentration should not be excessive, as this may cause
marked
hypotension
and
delayed
recovery
from
anaesthesia. There is no plasma or effect-site concentration
that is appropriate for all patients. Rather, the concentration
required will depend on inter-individual patient variation,
other drugs administered and the degree of surgical
stimulus.
Inter-individual variation
There is considerable variation between patients in the
brain propofol concentration required for anaesthesia, as is
also the case for volatile anaesthetics [12]. The brain
concentration required cannot be predicted in advance, but
observation of the patient’s response during induction of
anaesthesia can give an indication of the approximate
propofol concentration that is likely to be required for
maintenance. In general, older patients require a lower
brain anaesthetic drug concentration than younger patients
[6], but there is considerable variation between individuals
of the same age and overlap between patients of different
ages. Patients who are ASA physical status 3–5 require
Figure 1 Estimated plasma concentrations (solid line) achieved with alternating infusion rates (dashed line) of 10 and 20 ml.h�1
1% propofol, in a 70 kg adult without a bolus dose (Marsh model). The concentrations change slowly and do not reach
concentrations usually associated with general anaesthesia.

Nimmo et al. | Total intravenous anaesthesia guidelines
 particularly careful management. They may require a lower
concentration to produce anaesthesia and may become
hypotensive during and after the induction period.
Other drugs administered
The administration of opioids, benzodiazepines, ketamine,
a2-adrenoceptor agonists, magnesium and nitrous oxide
result in a marked reduction in the required brain propofol
concentration [13, 14]. Synergy of effect occurs between
propofol and opioids. Opioids reduce the propofol dose
required to produce loss of consciousness and, in particular,
to obtund movement and haemodynamic responses to
noxious stimuli [15]. A remifentanil infusion is often used in
conjunction with propofol infusion. The rapid offset of effect
after stopping remifentanil enables doses to be given that
reduce
propofol
requirements
by
approximately
50%
(Table 1) without causing prolonged respiratory depression
after surgery. However, intra-operative remifentanil does not
provide postoperative analgesia. Higher dose remifentanil
infusions (target concentration above 5 ng.ml�1 or infusions
above 0.2 lg.kg�1.min�1) may cause acute opioid tolerance
or opioid-induced hyperalgesia but the clinical significance
of this is uncertain [16].
Degree of surgical stimulus
The brain propofol concentration required for adequate
anaesthesia during surgery is influenced by the magnitude
of the surgical stimulus. An effective regional anaesthetic
block will reduce the propofol concentration required.
Typical target concentrations in routine practice
Target concentrations should be individually determined
based on patient characteristics, other drugs administered
and the expected magnitude of surgical stimulus. If a
relatively rapid induction of anaesthesia is required, initial
plasma (Marsh model) or effect-site (Schnider model)
propofol target concentrations of 4–6 lg.ml�1 are typically
used in healthy young or middle-aged patients. During
maintenance of anaesthesia, target concentrations of 3.0–
6.0 lg.ml�1 (without opioids) or 2.5–4.0 lg.ml�1 (with
opioids) are typical. Higher initial targets may be required
for anxious and ‘robust’ individuals, whereas lower targets
are appropriate for older, frail or unwell patients.
Alternatively, a slower induction of anaesthesia may be
achieved
by
setting
a
lower
initial
target
propofol
concentration (e.g. 1 lg.ml�1) and making repeated 0.5–
1.0 lg.ml�1 incremental increases in the target concentration.
This technique can be particularly useful for older, frail or
unwell patients because it is associated with a less severe, and
less rapid, fall in blood pressure. A slower induction also makes
it easier for the anaesthetist to observe the estimated effect-site
concentration at which the patient stops responding to stimuli.
It is recommended that such a clinical calibration of the
individual patient’s response to propofol routinely takes
place during induction of anaesthesia using TCI. This can be
achieved by noting the effect-site concentrations at which
there is: a. loss of response to speech; and, b. loss of
movement in response to a noxious stimulus (e.g. very firm
pressure on the angle of the mandible). The latter
concentration may be used as a guide to the approximate
concentration likely to be required during maintenance of
anaesthesia.
Where TCI remifentanil is administered with propofol,
target remifentanil concentrations of 2–6 ng.ml�1 are
commonly used (equivalent to manual infusion rates of
approximately of 0.08–0.25 lg.kg�1.min�1) and will usually
necessitate ventilation of the patient’s lungs, as spontaneous
ventilation is uncommon with concentrations > 1.5 ng.ml�1
in adults. During maintenance of anaesthesia, the target
propofol concentration and opioid administration should
be adjusted, using clinical judgement supported by the
observation of clinical signs, and supplemented by the use
of
a
pEEG
device
if
the
patient
has
received
a
neuromuscular blocking drug.

 Practical aspects of the safe use of TIVA
Errors during TIVA can lead to the failure to deliver the
intended
drug,
underdosing,
overdosing
or
other
complications. In NAP5, the two commonest causes of
accidental awareness during TIVA were failure to deliver the
intended dose of drug and poor understanding of the
underlying pharmacological principles [1].
Drug concentrations, pumps, models and syringes
Within an anaesthetic department it is preferable to stock
only one concentration of propofol; the availability of both
1% and 2% propofol creates the potential for error. For the
same reason, remifentanil should be diluted to a single,
standard concentration. If more than one concentration of
drug is used, robust mechanisms should be in place to
minimise the risk of drug error.
Adequate numbers of TCI pumps should be available
in areas where propofol infusions are used for maintenance
of anaesthesia. It is preferable to use a single model of TCI
pump, which should contain a locally approved set of
pharmacokinetic models.
Syringes
of
the
same
capacity
from
different
manufacturers have varying internal diameters so that for
the same travel of the syringe plunger, different volumes of
drug are delivered. Therefore, it is necessary for the
infusion pump to be programmed with the brand of syringe
used. It is preferable for a single brand of syringe to be
used within a department. Syringes used for TIVA should
have Luer-lock connectors to reduce the risk of accidental
disconnection.
The choices available when programming a TCI pump
should be restricted to the agreed drug concentrations,
pharmacokinetic model(s) and syringe type to reduce the
risk of selecting the wrong concentration, model or syringe
type.
Pumps for both TCI infusions and fixed-rate infusions
should have audible alarms enabled by default. Alarms
should include high pressure, stopped infusion, empty
syringe, disconnection from the mains electricity supply
and low battery. Some pumps also have an alarm for a
drop in pressure which may permit some disconnections
to
be
detected.
Infusion
pumps
that
automatically
decrease the infusion rate to a low ‘keep vein open’
(‘KVO’) rate when the syringe is nearly empty, should not
be used for infusions of propofol or remifentanil. There
should be a visual display to indicate that the infusion is
in progress.
Pump dysfunction or failure is uncommon; however,
should equipment malfunction or fail in use, and where
potential or actual harm occurs, this should be reported
locally in line with hospital policy and to the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) via the
Yellow Card scheme for medical devices.
Mixing of drugs for infusion
Mixing of propofol and remifentanil in a single syringe is not
recommended because it has a number of disadvantages: it
is not possible to separately adjust the hypnotic and
analgesic components of the anaesthetic; when a TCI model
for propofol is used, the rapid infusion at induction or when
increasing the target concentration is likely to result in
administration of an excessive dose of remifentanil; if a low
concentration of remifentanil (e.g. 5 lg.ml�1) is used in the
mixture, the remifentanil becomes unstable and breaks
down in the syringe [17]; and remifentanil and propofol
undergo separation and layering when mixed in a syringe
resulting in varying remifentanil concentrations in different
regions of the syringe [18].
Drug infusion administration sets and i.v. cannulae
The infusion set through which TIVA is delivered should
have a Luer-lock connector at each end to reduce the risk of
accidental disconnection and an antisyphon valve on the
drug delivery line(s) to prevent uncontrolled infusion from a
damaged syringe. Where more than one infusion is given
through a single i.v. cannula (or central venous catheter
lumen) an anti-reflux valve should be present to prevent
backward flow of drug up the infusion tubing. It is
particularly important that this is present on an i.v. fluid
administration line. Drug and fluid lines should join together
as close to the patient as possible to minimise dead space in
which a drug may accumulate rather than entering the vein
[19, 20] (Fig. 2). The infusion line through which TIVA is
delivered should have as few potential sites for leakage as
possible. A continuous line from syringe to cannula is ideal,
without
additional
connections
or
three-way
taps.
Administration sets specifically designed for TIVA are more
likely to meet the above requirements than self-assembled
sets and for this reason are recommended. It is essential that
the i.v. cannula through which TIVA is administered is
securely sited in a vein. Particular caution should be
exercised if a cannula is inserted in a vein in the antecubital
fossa, where accidental subcutaneous administration may
be difficult to detect. Accidental awareness in patients
having TIVA is commonly due to the failure to deliver the
drug(s) due to a problem with the i.v. cannula. Previous
guidance has recommended that the i.v. cannula, through
which TIVA is delivered, should be ‘visible at all times’ [20],
216

Anaesthesia 2019, 74, 211–224
Nimmo et al. | Total intravenous anaesthesia guidelines
 although
this
has
been
modified
in
more
recent
publications to specify ‘visible whenever practical’ [1, 21]. It
is acknowledged that during some operations constant
observation of the i.v. cannula may not be practical. In these
circumstances anaesthetists should have a higher index of
suspicion for problems with the infusion and periodically
inspect the cannula site, if possible. The threshold for using
pEEG should be reduced in these circumstances. The
cannula site should be inspected immediately if the
patient’s response to the infused drug(s) appears less than
would be expected.
Preparation for TIVA
Pumps should be charged before use and, where practical,
mains powered during use to prevent failure due to battery
depletion. Infusion pumps should only be programmed
after a syringe containing the drug to be infused has been
placed in the pump. Cases of awareness have occurred
when a propofol syringe was placed in a pump that had
been
already
programmed
to
give
an
infusion
of
remifentanil. Such errors may also be reduced by having a
consistent lay-out of pumps, for example, placing the
propofol infusion pump at the top of any stack of pumps.
Syringes should be labelled with the drug name and
concentration.
To
avoid
drawing
up
drugs
into
an
incorrectly labelled syringe, and to avoid administering
diluent without active drug, drug labels should be attached
to syringes only when the intended drug is drawn up.
Most
propofol
formulations
available
in
Europe
support bacterial growth and postoperative infection has
resulted from contaminated propofol [22, 23]. Propofol
should be drawn up using precautions to reduce the risk of
contamination. Before use, the ampoule neck or rubber
stopper should be disinfected using medicinal alcohol, and
a new sterile syringe and drawing up device should be used
each time. All syringes should be prepared shortly before
use and those not used immediately should be sealed with
a cap.
Conduct of TIVA
The drugs to be administered, the programming of the
pump, the infusion set and the i.v. cannula should be
checked before starting TIVA. At induction, the dose of
drug administered by the pump and the infusion rates
should be observed periodically as a check that the system
is operating as expected. If a neuromuscular blocking drug
is to be administered, this should be given only after loss of
consciousness has been confirmed.
When TCI anaesthesia is used, additional ‘manual’
boluses
are
usually
not
required
and
the
target
concentration should be increased to deepen anaesthesia.
If a manual bolus is administered, the displayed drug
concentrations will be inaccurate for several minutes.
The infusion pump should be visible throughout
anaesthesia. The anaesthetist should observe the infusion
rate (e.g. ml.h�1 or mg.kg�1.h�1) every few minutes. If,
during maintenance of anaesthesia, a TCI pump shuts down
due to a depleted battery or has to be restarted due to a
malfunction, it is not appropriate to restart TCI anaesthesia
using the previous target concentration. If this was done, the
pump’s calculations would not take into account the drug
previously
administered
and
it
would
give
another
induction dose by rapid infusion, resulting in an excessively
high drug concentration. If a pump does shut down
accidently, then it is appropriate to restart it in the manual
mode and programme an infusion rate similar to that being
delivered at the time of failure.
All vascular access devices used for TIVA should be
flushed with at least twice the dead space volume of the
device at the end of the procedure. If this is not done, potent
anaesthetic drugs (e.g. remifentanil or neuromuscular
blocking drugs) may remain in the dead space of a vascular

 access device and may be accidently administered to the
patient postoperatively [24–26].
Consent for anaesthesia
As with all medical interventions, the use of TIVA requires an
analysis of the risks and benefits for the patient to whom it
will be administered. Some observational studies have
found an association between TIVA and an increased
incidence
of
accidental
awareness
during
general
anaesthesia
[1],
whereas
others
have
not
[27].
An
observational study found an association between TIVA and
improved outcome after cancer surgery [28], but the results
of randomised trials are awaited. The anaesthetist should
consider what information the patient would wish to know
about the technique chosen. However, unbundling all
aspects of anaesthetic technique in the consent process
may
be
undesirable
and
impractical
[29].
Balancing
uncertain differences in the incidence of complications (e.g.
awareness) or benefits (e.g. cancer outcome) against a
proven frequent impact (e.g. reduced sickness) is complex.
The Working Party does not consider that use of TIVA per se
is an aspect of anaesthetic technique that routinely requires
specific formal consent, provided best practice is observed.
Whether consent is required should be assessed on a case
by case basis [30].
Monitoring the patient during TIVA
Monitoring of the patient during TIVA should be in
accordance
with
the
Association
of
Anaesthetists
recommendations for standards of monitoring during
anaesthesia and recovery [21]. Use of a pEEG monitor is
recommended when a neuromuscular blocking drug is
used with TIVA. The large majority of cases of self-reported
awareness that were identified in NAP5 occurred in patients
who had received a neuromuscular blocking drug [1].
Efforts to prevent awareness should, therefore, focus on
patients who receive a neuromuscular blocking drug. About
half of the reports of awareness in NAP5 occurred around
the time of induction of anaesthesia and transfer from the
anaesthetic room to the operating theatre. Processed EEG
monitoring should commence before administration of the
neuromuscular blocking drug.
During the maintenance phase of anaesthesia with an
inhaled
agent,
it
is
possible
to
use
the
end-tidal
anaesthetic gas concentration as an indication that the
anaesthetic drug is being delivered as intended; this is
not possible during TIVA. Monitoring of the effect of the
anaesthetic drug on the cerebral cortex with a pEEG
monitor can reduce the likelihood of awareness [31]. The
isolated forearm technique can also be used to assess
conscious state in paralysed patients [32–34]; however, its
use to date has largely been confined to research studies.
Almost 20% of the NAP5 reports of awareness occurred
after the end of surgery and these were commonly
caused by neuromuscular blockade still being present
when the patient regained consciousness [1]. Processed
EEG monitoring should, therefore, be continued until full
recovery from the effects of the neuromuscular blockade
has
been
confirmed
by
monitoring
with
a
nerve
stimulator.
Processed
EEG
monitors
provide
much
more
information to the anaesthetist than just a derived index
value. For example, the EEG waveform may be displayed
together with measures of the EEG signal quality, EMG
activity and degree of burst suppression. Optimal use of a
pEEG monitor involves using all the information it provides
together with the information from other patient monitors,
clinical judgement and experience. A pEEG index value may
be a useful extra piece of information, but it should be
considered along with all the other available information
before making a judgement about whether anaesthetic
dose should be adjusted. Anaesthetists require training and
experience in the use of pEEG monitors as part of training in
TIVA. Adequate numbers of pEEG monitors should be
available in areas where propofol infusions may be used for
maintenance of anaesthesia.
TIVA in particular circumstances
Rapid sequence induction
Rapid sequence induction may be undertaken before the
maintenance
of
anaesthesia
with
an
i.v.
infusion
of
propofol. If TCI propofol is used for the induction of
anaesthesia, this can be achieved by setting an initial high
target concentration so the induction ‘bolus’ dose of
propofol is delivered as a rapid infusion (e.g. 1200 ml.h�1),
and then reducing the target concentration once the
desired dose has been administered. (Many pumps will
display the bolus dose to be given for a set target
concentration before the start button is pressed). Some
newer TCI pumps can run bolus infusion rates of 1800–
2200 ml.h�1. When using a TCI propofol pump for rapid
sequence induction, the induction dose of propofol is
typically delivered more slowly than a manual bolus. The
time to loss of consciousness may be reduced by co-
administration of other drugs with a rapid onset such as
remifentanil or alfentanil. If the induction propofol bolus is
given manually rather than by the TCI pump, then the
estimated plasma propofol concentration displayed by the
pump will not be accurate in the early phase of the
anaesthetic. An alternative approach is to use a bolus of a

Nimmo et al. | Total intravenous anaesthesia guidelines
 different drug such as thiopentone or etomidate for the
rapid sequence induction and then use TCI propofol for
maintenance of anaesthesia. If ketamine is given, then
paradoxical increases in pEEG index value may occur [35].
Switching from inhalational anaesthesia to TIVA
When switching from inhalational anaesthesia to TIVA, it is
important to ensure that an adequate brain concentration of
the i.v. anaesthetic agent is achieved as the concentration of
volatile anaesthetic agent falls, in order to ensure continued
anaesthesia. Several reports of awareness have occurred
when
changing
from
maintenance
with
an
inhaled
anaesthetic to i.v. propofol, for example, to facilitate
postoperative transfer to the ICU. All patients identified in
NAP5 who had suffered awareness in this manner had
received
a
neuromuscular
blocking
drug
[1].
The
commonest cause appeared to be the use of inappropriately
low doses of propofol by fixed-rate infusions so that when the
anaesthetic effect of the volatile anaesthetic wore off,
insufficient propofol had been administered to maintain
anaesthesia. This may be avoided by using a TCI pump and
increasing
the
target
concentration
as
the
end-tidal
concentration of volatile anaesthetic agent falls. If a manual
infusion is used, then it will be necessary to give an initial
bolus or rapid infusion followed by a decreasing infusion
rate. Processed EEG monitoring should be used whenever
maintenance of general anaesthesia is changed from an
inhaled anaesthetic agent to TIVA in a patient who has
received a neuromuscular blocking drug, and should start
before the switch is made.
TIVA outside the operating theatre and during transfers
When TIVA is delivered outside the operating theatre, for
example, in the radiology or emergency department, the
same standards of practice and monitoring should apply
as for TIVA given in theatre. Several reports of awareness
in NAP5 were from patients who had received propofol
infusions outside the operating theatre or during transfer,
and the commonest cause of awareness was the use of
inappropriately
low
doses
of
propofol
by
fixed-rate
infusion. The use of TCI pumps and pEEG monitoring
may reduce the risk of awareness in this situation.
Monitoring depth of anaesthesia is desirable during the
transfer of patients using TIVA who have received a
neuromuscular
blocking
drug.
If
a
portable
battery-
powered pEEG monitor is not available, then pEEG
monitoring during the period leading up to the transfer
may assist with the choice of target concentration/infusion
rate to be used during transfer.
Magnetic resonance imaging
All anaesthetists administering TIVA during magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scanning should be competent
in the use of this technique within this environment.
Anaesthesia for MRI can be maintained by TIVA or
inhalational anaesthesia. Some patients requiring MRI
scanning
will
be
transferred
to
the
scanner
with
anaesthesia already maintained with i.v. infusions. In
these situations, the options for the maintenance of
anaesthesia
during
scanning
include
continuing
with
TIVA
or
switching
to
an
inhalational
anaesthetic;
however, extra vigilance is necessary to minimise the
attendant risks, such as awareness during the transition
period between maintenance agents. Only a few infusion
pumps are MRI compatible and this may necessitate
using a pump situated outside of the scanning room.
Some infusion pumps may be placed within a specially
designed
radiofrequency
shield
enclosure
(Faraday
cage). However, there is a risk of the door of the
enclosure occluding infusion lines. The pump display(s)
should
be
visible
all
times,
wherever
the
pump
is
situated. The majority of infusion pumps are not allowed
to cross the 50 Gauss field strength line.
Specific safety issues of using infusion anaesthesia
during scanning are:
1
The i.v. cannula site is not visible. There should be a
high index of suspicion for problems with infusions.
Where possible the anaesthetist should check the
cannula site, infusion tubing and connections between
scanning sequences.
2
The anaesthetist may not be able to hear pump alarms,
either from the viewing room or from inside the
scanning room.
3
Long
infusion
lines
are
usually
necessary.
It
is
preferable to use a single, long infusion line than to
connect multiple shorter lines together. Failure to
connect i.v. extensions correctly may cause drug
leakages that are not detected by the pump. Serially
connected extensions may cause excessive resistance,
which when detected by the pump, will result in
cessation of the infusion. Long infusion sets specifically
designed for TIVA in a MRI scanner are available, and
their use is recommended. The high-pressure alarm
limit on infusion pumps may be adjustable. The
anaesthetist
should
ensure
that

Processed EEG monitoring during anaesthesia in the

monitors are not MRI compatible.
Obstetrics
This guideline makes no recommendation on the routine
use of TIVA in obstetric anaesthesia. This is an area which
requires further research. In situations where TIVA is
required (e.g. the transfer of an anaesthetised patient to the
ICU), the principles in this guideline apply.
General anaesthesia in the intensive care unit (ICU)
These guidelines are not intended to apply to sedation of
patients in the ICU.
When general anaesthesia is required in the ICU, for the
performance of a surgical or diagnostic procedure, then
TIVA is almost invariably used. Similar considerations
should apply as for the use of TIVA in the operating theatre.
Total intravenous anaesthesia may be administered using
either a manual propofol infusion or a TCI pump. However,
the propofol pharmacokinetic models in TCI pumps were
developed from studies involving healthy patients or
subjects. These models are unlikely to accurately predict the
plasma propofol concentration in critically ill patients with
organ
dysfunction.
Furthermore,
the
calculation
of
predicted concentration will not take account of any
propofol administered for ICU sedation before the TCI
pump is used. Therefore, titration to clinical effect rather
than relying on the estimated drug concentration displayed
on the pump is likely to be appropriate. Processed EEG
monitoring may be useful in ICU patients receiving TIVA
although data on its use are limited.
TIVA in paediatric practice
Anaesthetists providing infusion anaesthesia to children
require specific knowledge, recognising the pharmacological
and practical differences in this age range.
The two widely used and validated paediatric TCI
programmes which target plasma propofol concentration
are the Kataria [8] and Paedfusor [9] models. The Kataria
model can be used in children aged 3–16 years and
weighing 15–61 kg, and the Paedfusor in children aged 1–
16 years
and
weighing
5–61 kg.
Teenage
children
weighing > 61 kg can be managed using the Marsh adult
model. Details of the pharmacokinetics and TCI models
relevant to paediatrics can be found in Appendix 1.
Pain on induction is common and can be reduced by
prior administration of i.v. lidocaine, opioids or nitrous
oxide. A target of 5–6 lg.ml�1 will usually be sufficient for
rapid induction of anaesthesia. When switching to TIVA
following a gaseous induction it is important to avoid an
inadequate effect-site concentration. This may be achieved
by setting an initial propofol target of 4 lg.ml�1 and
decreasing the target after the pump indicates that a 2–
3 mg.kg�1 bolus has been delivered (which typically takes
60–120 s). When using an analgesic adjunct such as
remifentanil or a regional block, the propofol target
concentration during maintenance can be reduced by up to
50% [34]. This is important in children aged < 12 years, as a
target
concentration
of
5–6 lg.ml�1
soon
leads
to
accumulation of propofol, resulting in delayed recovery
after anaesthesia. A target propofol concentration of 2.5–
4 lg.ml�1 is generally adequate during the maintenance of
anaesthesia for cases lasting > 30 min when an opioid is
also given. In some circumstances the required target
concentrations may fall outside of this range. Titration to
effect and clinical judgement are always necessary.
Remifentanil is commonly used with propofol infusions.
Children aged < 8 years tend to be less sensitive to its effects,
tolerating larger doses when breathing spontaneously and
requiring higher doses to produce a given antinociceptive
effect [36, 37]. Target-controlled infusion of remifentanil can
be administered using adult targets and the Minto model for
patients aged ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 30 kg. For smaller
children, it is necessary to use a manual infusion, for example,
0.2–0.5 lg.kg�1.min�1 as a TCI model is not yet available.
Propofol-related infusion syndrome (PRIS) is a very
rare,
but
potentially
fatal,
condition
associated
with
propofol infusion. Interference with mitochondrial energy
production
leads
to
rhabdomyolysis,
acidaemia
and
multi-organ
failure.
Risk
factors
include:
prolonged
infusion; high propofol delivery rate (> 6 mg.kg�1.h�1);
critical illness; low sugar intake; and co-administration of
catecholamines and steroids [38]. It is even rarer in the
context
of
TIVA
for
general
anaesthesia.
There
are
several
uncommon
metabolic
conditions,
such
as
mitochondrial disease, fatty acid oxidation disorders and
co-enzyme Q deficiency, which cause an increased risk
of
developing
PRIS
if
propofol
infusions
are
administered. Guidelines for the safe administration of
anaesthesia in adults with mitochondrial disease have
been
published
(http://www.newcastle-mitochondria.c

 agents on the EEG in children under the age of 1 year differ
from those in older children and adults [39]. Processed EEG
monitoring
is
recommended
when
a
neuromuscular
blocking drug is administered in children aged > 1 year.
Training and competency in TIVA
All
anaesthetists
need
to
be
able
to
deliver
TIVA
competently as they may encounter situations where
administration of an inhaled anaesthetic is not possible.
However, surveys have found that not all anaesthetists in the
UK and Ireland are gaining adequate knowledge and
experience in the use of TIVA [1, 40–42].
Schools of Anaesthesia and training bodies should
provide teaching, training and practical experience of TIVA
to all Anaesthetic and Intensive Care Medicine trainees.
Training in TIVA should be part of core anaesthetic training.
Trainee anaesthetists should be competent in the use of
TIVA before they are left unsupervised to care for a patient
receiving TIVA, including patients anaesthetised by an i.v.
propofol infusion for transfer or for anaesthesia outside the
operating theatre. Resources are available to help support
this learning (http://www.siva.ac.uk/ accessed 25/02/2018).
Consultant and staff grade, associate specialist and
specialty doctor (SAS) anaesthetists have a responsibility to
ensure that they have the knowledge and skills required to
deliver TIVA competently and safely. This should form part
of their ongoing career-long learning.

Appendix
Pharmacokinetic principles and models
for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA)
A pharmacokinetic model is a mathematical description of
the distribution, metabolism and elimination of a drug in
the
body.
The
pharmacokinetic
behaviour
of
most
anaesthetic drugs used for TIVA can be predicted with a
three-compartment
model
(Fig. S1).
The
drug
is
administered into the central compartment (V1), which
represents the initial volume of distribution. The second
(V2)
and
third
(V3)
compartments
are
mathematical
constructs explaining rapid and slow redistribution of drug
from V1 into highly perfused and less well perfused tissues,
respectively. Rate constants describe the proportion of
drug moving between compartments, for example, k12
indicates the movement from V1 to V2, and k21 the
movement from V2 to V1. A metabolic rate constant (k10)
describes the proportion of drug in V1 that is metabolised
or eliminated in any unit of time. Finally, a rate constant ke0
describes the transfer from the central compartment to the
effect-site
(brain).
The
ke0
describes
the
speed
of
equilibration between plasma and brain; a higher ke0
equates to more rapid equilibration.
These volumes and rate constants are determined from
studies in which the drug is administered to volunteers or
patients by bolus, infusion or both, following which timed
blood samples are taken to assay drug concentrations. In
some studies, propofol concentration was measured in
whole blood whereas in others it was measured in plasma.
There is a slight difference between whole blood and plasma
concentrations but for simplicity we have used the term
plasma
concentration
throughout
this
document.
Mathematical modelling software is used to estimate these
pharmacokinetic variables in individual subjects, and then to
estimate the influence of potential covariates such as body
weight and age on these variables. Finally, a population
model is developed, incorporating significant covariates.
Importantly, different pharmacokinetic models use quite
different covariates and pharmacokinetic variables.
Anaesthesia may be induced and maintained either
using manual dosing where the anaesthetist determines the
bolus dose(s) and infusion rates to be used or using a target
controlled infusion (TCI) pump. A TCI pump contains a
microprocessor programmed with pharmacokinetic models
for relevant drugs.
How does a TCI pump achieve and maintain the
programmed plasma concentration?
The user selects the drug and pharmacokinetic model to be
used by that TCI pump, and inputs the patient characteristics
(covariates)
and
the
desired
(‘target’)
initial
blood
concentration. Once started, the system delivers a bolus as a
fast
infusion
(600–1200 ml.h�1)
to
achieve
the
target
concentration in V1 (Fig. S2a). During use, the pump software
calculates
the
estimated
amount
of
drug
in
each
compartment every 10 s. It calculates the net amount of drug
required over the following 10 s which depends on the target
concentration, estimated drug metabolised and the net
movement of drug between V1 and V2, and between V1 and
V3. For a stable plasma concentration, the amount of drug
metabolised per minute is constant, while the net movement
of drug between compartments gradually decreases as
gradients equalise. If the target concentration is unchanged,
the pump will thus slowly decrease the infusion rate. If the
target concentration is increased by the anaesthetist, a new
bolus will be administered and the infusion rate increased. If

 the target concentration is decreased, drug infusion will
pause until the plasma concentration is estimated to have
fallen to the new target, taking into account metabolism and
flux of drug between compartments, at which time the
infusion will restart at a lower rate.
What is effect-site targeting?
Effect-site targeting is a TCI mode in which the user inputs a
target effect-site (brain) concentration (Fig. S2b). When the
effect-site target concentration is increased a bolus of drug
is administered, raising the plasma concentration higher
than the effect-site target, to hasten the increase in effect-
site concentration. However, when plasma concentration
targeting is used, a similar effect can be achieved on
induction by setting a higher initial plasma target which is
reduced after the patient has lost consciousness.
With effect-site targeting, the size of the bolus and the
‘overshoot’ in plasma concentration depends considerably
on the V1, V2 and ke0 in the pharmacokinetic model. When
the effect-site target concentration is decreased, the system
stops
infusing
drug
until
the
estimated
effect-site
concentration has decreased to the new target.
Key differences between common propofol models
The two most commonly used adult propofol models are
Marsh [1] and Schnider [2, 3] models. Both were derived
from studies involving healthy adults and did not include
obese or older patients [4]. The Marsh model is the simplest.
Compartment volumes are scaled to body weight only, and
rate constants are fixed. The original model had no ke0. This
model is used in the Diprifusor (AstraZeneca Limited,
Macclesfield, UK) devices, which only offer plasma targeting,
although later versions of the Diprifusor used the Marsh
model together with a ke0 of 0.26 min�1 to calculate and
display an estimated effect-site concentration for information
purposes. Most newer ‘open TCI’ pumps that offer effect-site
targeting with the Marsh model use a more rapid ke0 (e.g.
1.2 min�1) to avoid excessively large loading doses.
The Schnider model includes age, gender, total body
weight and height as covariates. V1 and V3 are fixed, and
thus so are k13 and k31. V2 is influenced by age, and thus so
are k12 and k21. The metabolic rate constant, k10 is
influenced by total weight, height and lean body mass
(which is turn depends on gender, height and total weight).
The Schnider model should routinely be used in effect-site
targeting mode. Despite the use of effect-site targeting, for a
given target concentration, in most patients, induction doses
are similar to those provided by the Marsh model in plasma
targeting mode because a smaller V1 is used in the Schnider
model. Thereafter, for the same target concentration, in
most patients infusion rates will be somewhat higher with
the Marsh model than when the Schnider model is used.
Manual infusion for propofol
For general anaesthesia, the ‘Roberts’ (or Bristol) regimen
for propofol has been commonly used [5]. It involves a
loading bolus of 1 mg.kg�1 followed by a step-down
infusion scheme (10 mg.kg�1.h�1 for the first 10 min,
8 mg.kg�1.h�1 for the next 10 min, and then 6 mg.kg�1.h�1
thereafter). For an average healthy young adult of normal
proportions,
this
scheme
will
achieve
a
plasma
concentration of approximately 3 lg.ml�1. However, that
concentration is not appropriate for all patients and may be
inadequate
for
some
but
excessive
for
others.
The
concentration required is affected by other drugs given and
in the study by Roberts et al., temazepam premedication,
intravenous fentanyl and inhaled nitrous oxide were all
given in addition to propofol [5].
If the anaesthetist using a manual infusion wishes to
achieve a
higher
plasma propofol
concentration,
an
additional bolus is administered and the infusion rate
increased. To reduce the plasma propofol concentration,
the infusion is paused for a period and then recommenced
at a lower rate. However, determining the size of an
additional bolus or the duration of a pause in an infusion,
and the subsequent infusion rates is difficult.
TCI and manual infusion for remifentanil
The Minto model is a validated model for remifentanil, and
can be used for plasma or effect-site targeted TCI in patients
aged ≥ 12 yr, and weighing ≥ 30 kg [6, 7]. Covariates
incorporated in this model include age, weight, height and
sex. From the latter three covariates, lean body mass is
calculated, but the calculation is only valid in patients who
have a BMI < 35 kg.m�2 in females and < 42 kg.m�2 in males.
Typical maintenance doses of remifentanil are in the
order of 0.08–0.25 lg.kg�1.min�1 which are equivalent to
plasma concentrations of approx. 2–6 ng.ml�1 (Table S1).
In older patients, the plasma concentration resulting from a
given infusion rate is higher, whilst in children it is lower. In
young
or
middle-aged
healthy
adults
of
normal
proportions,
a
plasma
concentration
appropriate
for
tracheal intubation (approximately 6 ng.ml�1) can be
achieved reasonably quickly by giving a loading dose in the
form of an initial rapid infusion of 0.5 lg.kg�1.min�1 with a
step down to 0.25 lg.kg�1.min�1 after 3 min. Giving a
bolus loading dose manually from a syringe is not
recommended because that technique may result in an
excessively high peak remifentanil concentration leading to
severe bradycardia and chest wall rigidity.

 Paediatric considerations
Compartment volumes in children are about twice the size
of those in adults in comparison with their body weight. This
difference gradually reduces from around 12 years of age,
reaching adult values at 16 year. Thus, to achieve a given
plasma concentration, children require larger propofol
bolus doses and initial infusion rates relative to body weight
than adults.
During prolonged infusion of propofol in children aged
< 12 year, drug accumulation in the peripheral compartment
occurs to a greater extent than in adults. Therefore, when the
infusion is stopped, it typically takes longer in a child for the
propofol concentration to decline to a level at which
consciousness is regained than in an adult [8, 9]. Propofol
requirements can be reduced, and speed of emergence
improved,
by
remifentanil
(or
other
opioid)
co-
administration, and the use of other drugs such as nitrous
oxide, ketamine and a2 agonists. Most children regain
consciousness
at
an
estimated
propofol
plasma
concentration of approximately 2 lg.ml�1, but this can vary
considerably from 1 to 3 lg.ml�1 depending on inter-
individual differences and the use of adjunctive drugs [10].
The two widely available and validated paediatric
models which target plasma propofol concentration are
Kataria [11] for ages 3–16 years and Paedfusor [12] for
ages 1–16 years. Kataria can be used in children weighing
15–61 kg and Paedfusor 5–61 kg. Effect-site targeting
has not been implemented in paediatric TCI systems. For
an average length procedure in a young child, both
models administer approximately 50% more propofol
than in an adult using the Marsh model, which is why adult
models should not be used in this age group. If a propofol
manual infusion is used in children the initial bolus and
subsequent infusion rates need to be higher than in adults
[13].
