Knee
Hip and Knee Kinematics and Kinetics During Landing
Tasks After Anterior Cruciate Ligament
Reconstruction: A Systematic Review and Meta-
Analysis
Adam S. Lepley, PhD, ATC*; Christopher M. Kuenze, PhD, ATC†
*University of Connecticut, Storrs; †Michigan State University, East Lansing
Objective:
To evaluate the current evidence concerning
kinematic and kinetic strategies adopted during dynamic landing
tasks by patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
(ACLR).
Data Sources:
PubMed, Web of Science.
Study Selection:
Original research articles that evaluated
kinematics or kinetics (or both) during a landing task in those
with a history of ACLR were included.
Data Extraction:
Methodologic quality was assessed using
the modified Downs and Black checklist. Means and standard
deviations for knee or hip (or both) kinematics and kinetics were
used to calculate Cohen d effect sizes and corresponding 95%
confidence intervals between the injured limb of ACLR
participants and contralateral or healthy matched limbs. Data
were further stratified by landing tasks, either double- or single-
limb landing. A random-effects–model meta-analysis was used
to calculate pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals.
Data Synthesis:
The involved limbs of ACLR patients
demonstrated clinically and significantly lower knee-extension
moments during double-legged landing compared with healthy
contralateral limbs and healthy control limbs (Cohen d range ¼
�0.81 to �1.23) and decreased vertical ground reaction forces
when compared with healthy controls, regardless of task (Cohen
d range ¼�0.39 to �1.75).
Conclusions:
During single- and double-legged landing
tasks, individuals with ACLR demonstrated meaningful reduc-
tions in injured-limb knee-extension moments and vertical
ground reaction forces. These findings indicate potential
unloading of the injured limb after ACLR, which may have
significant implications for secondary ACL injury and long-term
joint health.
Key Words:
biomechanics, joint moments, injuries
Key Points
� During dynamic tasks, patients with a history of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction shifted joint loading to the
contralateral limb as shown by reductions in knee-joint moments and vertical ground reaction forces in the injured
limb.
� Biomechanical risk factors for secondary anterior cruciate ligament injury are likely different than those for primary
injury.
R
upture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a
debilitating sport-related injury, and many patients
elect to undergo surgical reconstruction (ACLR)
and aggressive rehabilitation. Roughly 80% of these
injuries occur from a noncontact mechanism during
dynamic activity,1,2 which suggests that the ACL injury
risk is greatly influenced by movement strategies during
these activities.3,4 The literature3,5,6 assessing ACL injury
risk has most commonly used variations of landing
maneuvers to replicate high-risk scenarios, as the majority
of ACL injuries occur during these maneuvers. More
importantly, previous researchers have identified specific
movement strategies at the hip and knee that place
individuals at a greater risk for ACL injury. In particular,
reduced flexion,7–9 excessive abduction,4,10 and excessive
internal-rotation angles at the knee11–13 and reduced
flexion,7–9 excessive adduction,14 and excessive internal-
rotation angles at the hip14–16 during landing are thought to
increase the ACL injury risk. Abnormal joint loading in the
frontal plane of the knee4,17,18 is also thought to increase the
risk of ACL injury.
The ability to prospectively identify differences in
landing strategies between those who go on to sustain an
ACL injury and those who do not has prompted the
development of ACL injury-prevention programs that focus
on neuromuscular and biomechanical interventions for the
purpose of correcting these potentially hazardous move-
ment patterns and reducing injury rates.19–21 Although
recent assessments have demonstrated ACL injury-preven-
tion programs to be effective in reducing the injury risk,22,23
many of the studies24,25 have focused on young female
athletes, with less information known regarding their male
counterparts.
Approximately 250 000 ACL ruptures occur annually in
the United States.3 Approximately 40% of these individuals
will not return to their preinjury activity levels.26 Those
who do return to activity, in particular, those who are young
and involved in pivoting and cutting sports, face rates of

 ACL reinjury that are reported to be as high as 20% to
25%,27–30 with a 15-times greater risk of subsequent ACL
injury compared with the risk of initial ACL injury.27
Similar to the initial ACL injury risk, subsequent
rupture is likely a result of poor movement strategies that
were not addressed during ACLR and therapeutic
rehabilitation. In fact, Paterno et al28 demonstrated that
increased frontal-plane movement at the knee and
transverse-plane moment at the hip significantly predicted
secondary ACL injury, providing evidence that altered
movement strategies may influence the risk of a second
ACL injury.4 However, despite the increased risk for
secondary ACL injury compared with the risk for primary
injury, a comprehensive understanding of the lower
extremity biomechanical adaptations observed after
ACLR is lacking. This information would guide clinicians
and researchers to a more systematic strategy for
evaluating the reinjury risk in these patients. Improving
the knowledge base regarding potentially modifiable
biomechanical risk factors will also aid in the develop-
ment of targeted interventions for patients with ACLR.
Although observed differences in landing biomechanics
between patients with ACLR and healthy controls will not
supply direct evidence for the risk factors of future injury,
it will be an initial step in identifying specific patterns of
lower extremity movement for clinicians to monitor and
for researchers to investigate in terms of how these
movement patterns may influence future injury risk and
prevention strategies.
Therefore, the purpose of our investigation was to
systematically evaluate the current evidence concerning
kinematic and kinetic strategies demonstrated by patients
after ACLR. Specifically, we looked to assess the hip and
knee biomechanics of the involved limb and compare them
with those of the contralateral uninjured limb as well as
healthy control limbs during dynamic landing assessments
(vertical jumps, drop jumps).
METHODS
Literature Search Strategy
An online search using the PubMed and Web of Science
databases was performed on June 4, 2016, to obtain
pertinent peer-reviewed articles. The search strategy
consisted of the terms anterior cruciate ligament OR ACL
AND reconstruction, AND landing biomechanics OR
kinematics OR kinetics. We assessed the titles of all articles
retrieved by the search engines for their relevance and
further evaluated those with merit. In addition, reference
sections from pertinent articles were checked to locate any
relevant articles that were not revealed during the initial
search.
Selection Criteria
To be included, an article needed to be original research
and written in English. No limitations were placed on the
date of publication. All included articles evaluated
kinematics or kinetics (or both) during a landing task in
the injured limb of those with a history of ACLR compared
with their own uninjured contralateral limb or participants
in a healthy control group. Each investigation also provided
means and standard deviations (SDs) for knee or hip
kinematics that were assessed at the point of initial contact
(IC) during the landing task, peak joint angle throughout
the landing phase of the task, or total joint range of motion
(joint excursion) throughout the primary landing phase of
the task. In addition, peak kinetics and vertical ground
reaction forces (vGRFs) over the course of the landing task
were also included in this analysis. After reviewing the
potential articles, we agreed on the final manuscripts to be
included in this review.
Assessing Methodologic Quality
A modified version of the Downs and Black checklist was
used to assess the methodologic quality of the included
studies.31 The modified Downs and Black checklist is a
valid and reliable instrument used for assessing both
randomized and nonrandomized investigations.31 This
assessment carries a maximum score of 15, with scores of
�12 indicating high methodologic quality, 10–11 indicating
moderate quality, and �9 representing low quality.31,32 This
classification was not used to assess the studies for the
inclusion or exclusion criteria but only to assess each one’s
methodologic quality. We independently reviewed and
scored each article based on the Downs and Black checklist
and agreed on the methodologic quality of 18 of the 20
included articles and discussed the remaining articles until
a consensus was reached (see the Supplemental Table,
available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-
334-16.S1).
Data Management and Statistical Approach
Each author reviewed every article. Data regarding hip
and knee kinematics and kinetics were extracted and
entered into an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp,
Redmond, WA). Specifically, frontal-, sagittal-, and
transverse-plane knee and hip angles at IC and peak and
joint angle excursions were extracted from each study
where applicable. In addition, peak knee and hip moments
and peak vGRF were also extracted for analysis. Data
were analyzed by limb using 2 comparisons: (1) the ACLR
limb compared with the contralateral uninjured limb and
(2) the ACLR limb compared with a healthy matched
control limb. In addition, the type of landing task (single-
legged or double-legged landing) was also collected and
used to stratify data by task. When comprehensive data or
means and SDs were not provided, we contacted the
corresponding author via e-mail to request appropriate
data.
Means and SDs from each variable of interest were used
to calculate standardized Cohen d effect sizes (ACLR limb
� comparison limb/pooled SD) with associated 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). Therefore, a negative effect size
indicated the ACLR limb had a lower value than the
comparison limb. Effect sizes were classified as weak (d �
0.2), small (d ¼ 0.2–0.5), moderate (d ¼ 0.5–0.8), or large
(d � 0.8).33 Differences between comparison groups in
individual studies were established if the CI associated with
an effect size did not cross 0 (y-axis). In addition, we used a
random-effects–model meta-analysis approach to calculate
pooled effect sizes and 95% CIs for each group of
variables.

 Other pertinent information collected from each study
was demographics, activity level, time since surgery, sex,
and graft type when reported.
RESULTS
Literature Search
The initial database search and cross-referencing yielded
1141 articles. A total of 35 articles were eligible for
inclusion beyond title and abstract review, and each of us
further evaluated the full texts of these articles. Two articles
were removed because they evaluated a horizontal hopping
task as opposed to a landing task.34,35 Three articles used a
clinical assessment of landing (Landing Error Scoring
System) with no objective kinematic or kinetic data and
were therefore removed.36–38 One article28 was removed, as
it was a further analysis of data from another published
study that was already included in this review.39 Another
article40 was removed for publishing only limb symmetry
scores as opposed to data for individual limbs. Eight
additional articles41–48 were removed because the authors
did not report means SDs or reply to requests for data.
Therefore, 20 articles39,49–67 met the selection criteria and
were included in the analysis (Figure 1). Of the included
articles, 8 used double-limb landing tasks and 12 used
single-limb landing tasks.
Only 4 of the included studies provided separate data for
cohorts within the ACLR groups. Nyland et al58 and
Miranda et al56 reported individual data for males and
females, Nyland et al59 reported data by the activity levels
of the ACLR participants, and Mohammadi et al57
separated data by graft type (bone-patellar tendon-bone
and semiten-dinosis-gracilis autografts). These data are
reported separately for the corresponding articles.
Methodologic Quality
Five of the 20 studies (25%) were classified as high
quality, 11 (55%) were of moderate quality, and 4 (20%)
were of low quality (see the Supplemental Table).
Hip Kinematics
A total of 19 data points from 9 studies were analyzed for
hip-flexion angles (Table 1A). A homogeneous effect (4/4
studies fell left of the y-axis) was present for reduced peak
and IC hip-flexion angles in the ACLR limb during double-
limb landing; however, 3 of 4 CIs crossed 0 (Cohen d range
¼�0.19 to 1.06). The combined effect for all 4 data points
was moderate, with effect sizes not crossing zero (Cohen d
¼�0.52; 95% CI ¼�0.92, �0.12; Table 1A). During single-
limb landing, the effect for increased hip-flexion angles at
IC in the ACLR limb was homogeneous (4/4) when
compared with both contralateral limbs and healthy
controls (Cohen d range ¼ 0.33 to 0.77; Table 1A).
However, the effects were inconclusive or heterogeneous
for sagittal-plane hip-joint excursion and peak hip-flexion
angle (Cohen d range ¼�0.74 to 0.99; Table 1A).
A total of 5 data points from 5 studies were analyzed for
hip-adduction angles (Table 1B). A homogeneous effect (2/
2) occurred for increased frontal-plane hip-excursion and
peak hip adduction in the ACLR limb during double-limb
landing when compared with healthy controls (Cohen d
range ¼ 0.71 to 1.15; Table 1B), demonstrating a strong
combined effect (Cohen d ¼ 0.91; 95% CI ¼ 0.37, 1.45).
During single-limb landing, the effects were heterogeneous

 for all hip-adduction variables (Cohen d range ¼ �0.67 to
0.31; Table 1B).
A total of 5 data points from 3 studies were analyzed for
hip internal-rotation angles. A homogeneous effect (5/5)
was identified for increased transverse-plane hip excursion
and peak hip internal rotation in the ACLR limb during
both double-limb and single-limb landing when compared
with the contralateral limb and healthy controls (Cohen d
range ¼ 0.11 to 0.96; Table 1C). However, 3 of 5 CIs
crossed zero. Compared with healthy controls, a moderate
combined effect indicated that ACLR participants landed
with increased internal rotation at the hip during single-
limb landing tasks (Cohen d ¼ 0.56; 95% CI ¼ 0.12, 1.00;
Table 1C).
Knee Kinematics
A total of 23 data points from 12 studies were analyzed
for knee-flexion angles (Table 2A). Heterogeneous effects
were demonstrated for peak knee-flexion angle, sagittal-
plane knee-joint excursion, and knee-flexion angle at IC for
both double- and single-limb landing tasks (Cohen d range
¼�1.16 to 1.72; Table 2A). All combined effects for knee-
flexion angle yielded weak results with inconclusive CIs.
A total of 7 data points from 5 studies were analyzed for
knee-adduction angles (Table 2B). A homogeneous effect
(3/3) was noted for decreased peak knee-adduction angle
and frontal-plane knee-joint excursion in the ACLR limb
during double-limb landing when compared with healthy
controls (Cohen d range ¼ �1.05 to �0.61; Table 2B),
resulting in a moderate combined effect with CIs that did
not cross zero (Cohen d ¼�0.73; 95% CI ¼�1.12, �0.34;
Table 2B). However, during single-limb landing, the effects
were heterogeneous for peak knee adduction (Cohen d
range ¼ �0.76 to 0.49; Table 2B), yielding a weak and
inconclusive combined effect size (Cohen d ¼�0.15; 95%
CI ¼�0.88, 0.56).
A total of 9 data points from 8 studies were analyzed for
knee internal-rotation angles. We found a homogeneous
effect (2/2) for increased transverse-plane knee-joint
excursion in the ACLR limb when compared with healthy
controls during double-limb landing; however, CIs for both
crossed zero (Cohen d range ¼�0.47 to �0.21; Table 2C).
Effects were heterogeneous when compared with the
contralateral limb during double-limb landing (Cohen d
range ¼ �0.46 to 2.05; Table 2C). During single-limb
landing, heterogeneous effects were present for knee
internal rotation for both comparison limbs (Cohen d range
¼�1.94 to 0.02; Table 2C). All combined effects for knee
internal-rotation angle yielded weak results with inconclu-
sive CIs.
Hip Kinetics
A total of 7 data points from 5 studies were analyzed for
internal hip-extension moments (Table 3A). There was a
homogeneous effect (2/2) for reduced internal hip-exten-
sion moments in the ACLR limb when compared with
healthy controls during double-limb landing, and neither CI
crossed 0 (Cohen d range ¼�1.57 to �1.00; Table 3A). The
combined effect for internal hip-extension moment during
double-limb landing was strong with conclusive CIs (Cohen
d ¼ �1.19; 95% CI ¼ �1.73, �0.64). During single-limb
landing, heterogeneous effects were present for internal

 hip-extension moments when compared with both contra-
lateral limbs and healthy controls (Cohen d range ¼�0.52
to 1.41; Table 3A); both combined effects were considered
small with CIs that crossed zero.
Knee Kinetics
A total of 9 data points from 7 studies were analyzed for
internal knee-extension moments (Table 3B, Figure 2). A
homogeneous effect (3/3) was observed for reduced
internal knee-extension moments in the ACLR limb when
compared with contralateral limbs and healthy controls
during double-limb landing, with no CIs crossing zero
(Cohen d range ¼ �1.23 to �0.81; combined Cohen d ¼
�0.92; 95% CI ¼�1.45, �0.38; Table 3B, Figure 2). During
single-limb landing, effects were heterogeneous when
compared with healthy controls (Cohen d range ¼ �1.16
to 0.80; combined Cohen d ¼�0.10; 95% CI ¼�1.27, 1.07;
Table 3B, Figure 2) but homogeneous (3/3) for reductions
in internal knee-extension moments when compared with
the contralateral limb (Cohen d range ¼ �1.46 to �0.14;
combined Cohen d ¼�0.74; 95% CI ¼�1.51, �0.03; Table
3B, Figure 2).
A total of 3 data points from 2 studies were analyzed for
internal knee-abduction moments, during single-limb
landing only (Table 3C). Effects were homogeneous when
compared with both the contralateral and healthy control
limbs. Effect sizes showed that internal knee-abduction
moments were increased in the ACLR limb compared with
the healthy controls (Cohen d range ¼ 0.83 to 0.94;
combined Cohen d ¼ 0.88; 95% CI ¼ 0.32, 1.44); however,
they were decreased compared with the contralateral limb
(Cohen d ¼�0.51).
Peak vGRF
A total of 19 data points from 10 studies were analyzed
for peak vGRF (Table 4, Figure 3). There was a
homogeneous effect (19/19) for reduced peak vGRF in
the ACLR limb during both double and single limb landing
when compared with contralateral and healthy control
limbs (Cohen d range ¼ �3.16 to 0.00). Comparisons
demonstrated effect sizes with CIs that did not cross 0 when
the ACLR limb was compared with the contralateral limb
during double-limb landing (Table 4, Figure 3). All
combined effect sizes demonstrated moderate to strong
effects with CIs that did not cross 0 (Figure 3A: combined
Cohen d ¼ �0.62; 95% CI ¼ �0.94, �0.29; Figure 3B:
combined Cohen d ¼�0.94; 95% CI ¼�1.24, �0.63; Figure

Figure 3D: combined Cohen d ¼ �0.79; 95% CI ¼ �1.31,
�0.28).
DISCUSSION
In this review, we sought to systematically evaluate the
kinematic and kinetic patterns of the hip and knee during
dynamic landing assessments in patients with a history of
ACLR. Our main findings were that (1) the involved limb
of patients with ACLR demonstrated smaller knee-exten-
sion moments during double-legged landings compared
with the healthy contralateral limb and healthy controls in
100% of the included studies (3/3; 1 low, 1 moderate, and 1
high quality; Table 3B, Figure 2) and (2) there was a
Table 1C.

 homogeneous effect demonstrating decreased vGRF of the
ACLR limb when compared with the contralateral limb (12/
12 included data points) and healthy controls (7/7 included
data points) regardless of task, with 47.4% (9/19) of the
included data points demonstrating a large, conclusive
effect size with CIs that did not cross zero (Table 4, Figure
3). Importantly, the methodologic quality of the studies that
supplied conclusive effect sizes for vGRF were all of
moderate39,62 or high57,66 quality. These findings are
supported by the strong combined effect sizes with CIs
not crossing 0. Both findings suggest an alteration in the
loading of the involved limb, which may have significant
implications for rehabilitation strategies as well as the
subsequent risk of knee-joint injury.
Based on the available studies, it appears that patients
with ACLR landed with lower peak knee-extension
moments in their involved limb during a double-legged
landing task (Table 3B). The reduction in knee-extension
moments during double-limb landing is not supported in the
ACL injury-prevention literature, as no current evidence
suggests that asymmetries in knee-extension moment were
present before the initial ACL injury. Therefore, these data
likely mean that alterations leading to asymmetry in knee-
extension moment occurred in response to the injury. A
reduction in knee-joint loading was also observed during
other activities in patients with ACLR, such as level-ground
walking gait69,70 and stair ambulation,71,72 indicating that
compensatory biomechanics persisted across tasks. The
reduction in knee-extension moment during gait resulted
from either insufficient quadriceps strength, which meant
the muscle was unable to eccentrically distribute force
properly,73,74 or from planned biomechanical adaptations
due to pain or psychological favoring of the healthy limb.75
Interestingly, the data were inconclusive regarding the
effect of ACLR on knee-extension moments during single-
legged landing. It is possible that during double-legged
landing and other tasks involving both limbs, patients with
ACLR were able to effectively shift the load to the
contralateral limb, thereby unloading the forces on the
injured limb. However, this strategy would not be available
to patients during single-limb tasks. The current evidence
illustrates that reductions in knee-extension moment during
double-limb tasks is likely attributable to physical and
psychological factors associated with the injury, such as
pain, fear avoidance, and quadriceps weakness. Further
investigation is warranted to determine the influence of a
reduction in knee-extension moment on secondary injury
risk, such as ACL reinjury and posttraumatic osteoarthritis.
Previous researchers76,77 have identified kinematic
strategies at the knee and hip during landing tasks that
are present before injury and increase the risk for initial
ACL injury; thus, it was plausible to expect these
alterations would also be present in patients after ACLR.
Surprisingly, we observed no conclusive effect for
differences in any of the kinematic variables at the knee
or hip during landing. The effect sizes associated with
kinematic adaptations were mostly heterogeneous, dem-
onstrating that the injured limbs of patients with ACLR
may land with more (2/12 included studies),46,66 less (3/12
included studies),51,52,64 or no difference (7/12 included
studies)50,56,58–61,67 in knee flexion compared with unin-
jured limbs and healthy controls (Table 2A). Peak knee-
adduction angle and frontal-plane knee-joint excursion
yielded the strongest evidence for kinematic alterations at
Figure 2.

 the knee, with lower knee-adduction angles (3/3 included
studies; Table 2B) in the involved limb compared with
healthy controls during double-legged landing. Yet similar
to the effects associated with knee-extension moment, this
finding was only present during double-legged landing,
and the data were inconclusive regarding the effect of
ACLR on knee-adduction angle during single-legged
landing. Authors of a previous study78 suggested that
individuals use different energy-dissipation strategies
during double- and single-legged landing tasks and
indicated that frontal-plane biomechanics at the knee
during single-legged landing may expose individuals to a
greater risk of traumatic knee injuries, such as secondary
ACL rupture. Future research would benefit from further
evaluation of double- and single-legged landings.
At the hip, large effects associated with reductions in
peak internal hip-extension moment (Table 3A) in the
ACLR involved limb compared with healthy controls and
similar to data regarding internal knee-extension moments
and knee-adduction angles were only detected during
double-legged landings. Of note, however, only 2
groups50,55 reported hip-extension moments. Multiple
large or homogeneous (or both) effects were noted for
increased peak hip adduction and frontal-plane hip-joint
excursion (3/5 included studies)51,55,67 and increased
transverse-plane hip-joint excursion compared with con-
tralateral healthy limbs (1/1 included studies)67 and
healthy matched controls (4/4 included studies), with
varying levels of methodologic quality among the
included studies (Table 1B and C).51,52,60,67 Our findings
are clinically concerning given that excessive adduction14
and internal rotation of the hip14–16 have been shown to
increase the risk of primary and secondary ACL injury
during a double-limb landing. However, the data included
in this review were ultimately heterogeneous for alter-
ations in hip kinematics or kinetics.
Because reduced flexion,7–9 excessive abduction,4,10 and
excessive internal rotation11–13 at the knee have previously
been identified as risk factors for initial ACL injury risk, we
expected to observe some, if not all, of these alterations in
the involved limbs of patients with ACLR. After reviewing
the included articles further, some evidence suggests that
sex may have had an effect on the observed results in knee
kinematics. Only 2 groups56,58 stratified their data by sex,
and both concluded that males used knee-flexion strategies
more consistent with healthy individuals, whereas females
experienced reduced peak knee-flexion range of motion and
reduced sagittal-plane knee-joint excursions during landing.
Reductions in knee-flexion angle, as well as other
alterations at the knee, such as increased abduction, were
also predictive of initial ACL injury risk and were more
prevalent in females than in males before ACL injury.4,9,79
Males and females demonstrated differences in landing
mechanics before ACL injury, and females also showed an
increased risk of initial noncontact ACL injury,80 so it is
possible we might have observed differences in knee
kinematics in this review if the data could have been
separated by sex. Unfortunately, this comparison was not
possible based on the available data. Further, only 1 set of
investigators57 stratified data based on graft type and
concluded that patients with bone-patellar tendon-bone
autografts demonstrated lower peak vGRF than those with
semitendinosis-gracilis autografts, potentially due to greater

 impairments in quadriceps function. Future researchers
should compare both sex and graft type to understand
biomechanical alterations during landing tasks after ACLR
and to identify separate secondary injury risk factors.
Anterior cruciate ligament injury-prevention programs
have been established based on modifiable biomechanical
risk factors noted during landing assessments in the
laboratory. Our intention was to review the current
literature and identify conclusive biomechanical alter-
ations in patients with ACLR with the goal of offering
clinicians and researchers valuable information to better
understand reinjury risk and prevention strategies in these
patients. Unfortunately, based on this review, it is clear
that the existing data were insufficient to establish any
consistent biomechanical alterations in patients with
ACLR. It remains plausible that the same risk factors
for initial ACL injury risk may also help to identify those
who will experience a second ACL rupture. However,
patients with ACLR may exhibit a unique set of risk
factors associated with the injury and surgical process
that expose them to secondary ACL injury. Or landing
biomechanics may not fully explain the secondary ACL
injury risk and other factors such as muscle strength,
symptoms, and psychological function may better account
for differences in ACLR patients and their risk for
secondary ACL injury. Future authors should focus on
prospective investigations to address biomechanical
alterations, neuromuscular deficits, and psychological
function to determine the combination of risk factors that
contribute to secondary ACL injury and should also
stratify by sex and graft type.
Clinical Implications
The risk of secondary ACL rupture remains higher than
that of the initial ACL injury,27 likely due to either poor
movement strategies that were present before injury or
lingering impairments that were not addressed by
surgical reconstruction and therapeutic rehabilitation.
Fortunately, movement strategies are modifiable and
represent an important target for successful clinical
intervention. Di Stasi et al81 thoroughly assessed the
ability of neuromuscular-training interventions to target
deficits associated with secondary ACL injury risk. They
provided evidence for specific exercises, including lunge
and tuck-jump progressions, knee and trunk stability
programs, and multidirectional exercises, to improve the
abnormal biomechanics we identified. Based on our
findings, clinicians should consider exercise and assess-
ment progressions that focus on gradual restoration of
involved-limb vGRFs and symmetry in knee-extension
moments. Further evidence suggests that feedback-
augmented exercises, with the use of audio, visual, or
other forms of external information (eg, feedback from a
force plate with the intent of influencing peak vGRFs),
may be beneficial for reversing the specific impairments
identified in this investigation, such as decreased knee-
extension moments and vGRFs.82–84 Based on these
findings, interventions must be tailored to the specific
deficits of the individual patient after ACLR; however,
using these guidelines as an evidence-based starting
point may help clinicians to focus their efforts more
effectively.

 Limitations
From a methodologic perspective, 1 limitation is that the
articles needed to be written in English to be included.
Also, despite numerous attempts, we had to exclude 8
additional studies (8/35 ¼ 22% originally pulled for review)
because the authors failed to report means and SDs and did
not reply to data requests. The lack of knowledge related to
preinjury biomechanics in individuals included in this
review may limit the ability to clearly describe the effect of
ACLR versus the underlying biomechanical patterns that
may have put these individuals at risk for primary ACL
injury. In addition, the lack of information about sex-
specific alterations in landing patterns after ACLR may
have limited both the effect sizes and the homogeneity of
findings presented in this review. Much of the work focused
on initial ACL injury prevention has been directed toward
female athletes, with little evidence regarding male
athletes. The failure of the included studies to compare
male and female participants represents a significant
limitation in the ACLR literature, which should be
addressed in future studies. Similarly, we were unable to
provide recommendations on the effect that graft type has
on landing strategies, which should also be considered a
limitation in the postreconstruction literature and a focus
moving forward. Lastly, published data are lacking on
transverse-plane kinematics in patients with ACLR, which
creates an area for future investigation.
CONCLUSIONS
Unique compensatory movement profiles after ACLR
include reduced knee-extension moments and decreased
vGRF in the injured limb, which have not been identified as
risk factors for initial ACL injury. These compensations
were present in the ACLR limb despite surgical interven-
tion and therapeutic rehabilitation, suggesting that the
current standard of care does not address these deficiencies.
Aberrant hip kinematics associated with initial ACL injury
may contribute to abnormal movement profiles after
ACLR; however, no clinically meaningful differences were
observed. Future researchers should focus on prospective
investigations to identify biomechanical risk factors in
patients with ACLR, including stratification by sex and
graft type.
