 It is often reported that, even after taking account of other
influences, such as age, gender and social support, people who
report religious belief and practice experience better mental and
physical health than those who do not.1–3 However, in a meta-
analysis of 147 studies on religious belief and depression, Smith
et al found only a weak negative correlation (70.096) between
religiousness and depressive symptoms.4 On average, positive
religiousness accounted for only 1% of the variance in the severity
of
depressive
symptoms.
Furthermore,
extrinsic
religious
orientation and so-called negative religious coping (for example,
avoiding difficulties through religious activities, blaming God
for difficulties) were associated with higher levels of depressive
symptoms.
The
way
religiosity
is
measured
in
research
can
be
problematic, particularly when well-being is included as a
component of the measure itself.5 Furthermore, most research
into this association has entailed Judeo-Christian concepts of
religion in White, North American populations, and has seldom
taken account of spiritual beliefs unconnected with personal or
public religious practice.6 In a number of studies in the UK, we
have reported that religious and spiritual beliefs are not linked
to better physical health outcomes7,8 and, in particular that
spiritual beliefs in the absence of a religious framework may be
associated with poorer mental health.9 The third National
Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in England10 was the first general
population survey in this country to include questions on
religious and spiritual beliefs. In this study we aimed to examine
the association between such beliefs and receipt of psychiatric
treatment, and a range of psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses
in a random sample of the English population.
Method
Survey methods
The third National Psychiatric Morbidity Study was conducted
between October 2006 and December 2007 across England, using
individual or groups of postcode sectors as sampling units.10 In
the first stage of sampling, postcode sectors were divided into
regions based on strategic health authority. All the sampling units
within each strategic health authority were further stratified on
the basis of the proportion of people in non-manual classes,
and sorted by the proportion of households without a car based
on UK 2001 Census data. A total of 519 postal sectors were
selected by sampling from each stratum with a probability
proportional to size in terms of the number of delivery points.
In the second stage of sampling, 28 delivery points were randomly
selected within each of the selected postal sectors, providing a
sample of 14 532 delivery points. Interviewers visited the addresses
to identify private households containing at least one person aged
16 or over. When visited, 1318 of the selected addresses were
found not to contain a private household and were excluded from
the survey sample. After contact was made with each eligible
household, one person was randomly selected to take part, using
the Kish method.11 Ethical constraints meant that data on people
refusing to participate could not be collected. Trained interviewers
conducted
a
structured,
laptop
computerised
interview
in
respondents’ homes, or elsewhere if requested, each interview
lasting on average 90 min. Interviewers were fully briefed on
the administration of the survey, and followed full sets of
written instructions. Topics covered on 1-day survey-specific

Background
Religious participation or belief may predict better mental
health but most research is American and measures of
spirituality are often conflated with well-being.
Aims
To examine associations between a spiritual or religious
understanding of life and psychiatric symptoms and
diagnoses.
Method
We analysed data collected from interviews with 7403 people
who participated in the third National Psychiatric Morbidity
Study in England.
Results
Of the participants 35% had a religious understanding of life,
19% were spiritual but not religious and 46% were neither
religious nor spiritual. Religious people were similar to those
who were neither religious nor spiritual with regard to the
prevalence of mental disorders, except that the former were
less likely to have ever used drugs (odds ratio (OR) = 0.73,
95% CI 0.60–0.88) or be a hazardous drinker (OR = 0.81, 95%
CI 0.69–0.96). Spiritual people were more likely than those
who were neither religious nor spiritual to have ever used
(OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.02–1.49) or be dependent on drugs
(OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.20–2.61), and to have abnormal eating
attitudes (OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.10–1.94), generalised anxiety
disorder (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.09–2.06), any phobia (OR = 1.72,
95% CI 1.07–2.77) or any neurotic disorder (OR = 1.37, 95% CI
1.12–1.68). They were also more likely to be taking
psychotropic medication (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.05–1.86).
Conclusions
People who have a spiritual understanding of life in the
absence of a religious framework are vulnerable to mental
disorder.

 training included introducing the survey, questionnaire content,
confidentiality and respondent distress.
The survey data were weighted to take account of likelihood of
selection and non-response, so that the results were representative
of the English household population aged 16 years and over.
Sample weights were first applied to take account of the different
probabilities
of
selecting
respondents
in
different
sized
households. Second, to reduce household non-response bias, a
household-level weight was calculated from a logistic regression
model using interviewer observation and area-level variables
(collected from Census 2001 data) available for responding and
non-responding households. Finally, calibration weighting based
on age, gender and region weighted the data to represent the
structure of the national population, and take account of
differential non-response between regions and age6gender groups.
We focus on the weighted results in the text, but provide
both weighted and unweighted bases in the table showing socio-
demographics and life views (online Table DS1). The unweighted
bases are presented where appropriate to show the number of
respondents included. The weighted base shows the relative size
of the various sample elements after weighting, reflecting their
proportions in the English population. The absolute size of the
weighted base has no particular significance, since it has been
scaled to the achieved sample size.10
Measures
Following confirmation of demographic data, the following
standardised instruments were used.
(a) Six questions adapted from those in the questionnaire version
of the Royal Free interview for religious and spiritual beliefs,
which assesses the nature and strength of beliefs and
practice.12,13 Because of the length of the overall interview,
questions on each topic had to be kept as brief as possible.
Participants were provided with the statement: ‘By religion,
we mean the actual practice of a faith, e.g. going to a
temple, mosque, church or synagogue. Some people do not
follow a religion but do have spiritual beliefs or experiences.
Some people make sense of their lives without any religious
or spiritual belief’. Although slightly shorter than in the
Royal Free Interview, the words used are exactly the same,
in order not to lose the statement’s essential meaning or
threatening the validity of the original instrument. The
interview then went on: ‘Would you say that you have a
religious or spiritual understanding of your life?’ Participants
could
indicate
whether
their
understanding
was
predominately (i) religious; (ii) spiritual or (iii) neither. If
they had a specific religion, they were asked to name it. If
religious or spiritual, they were asked to indicate on two
sliding scales of zero to ten how strongly they held to their
understanding of life and how important practice of their
faith (for example private meditation, religious services) was to
them. These respondents were also asked to report how often
they attended services, prayer meetings or places of worship.
(b) The revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) collects data
on symptoms of common mental disorder and derives
psychiatric diagnoses according ICD-10.14–16 The CIS-R
enquires about the presence and severity of 14 non-psychotic
psychiatric symptoms during the week prior to interview. The
CIS-R score may be analysed as: (i) a continuous score, along a
single continuum of severity; (ii) a dichotomous variable (case
threshold 512); and (iii) ICD-10 diagnostic categories.15,17
Diagnostic algorithms for use with the CIS-R cover (i)
depressive episodes (classified as mild, moderate or severe);
(ii) four types of anxiety disorder, namely generalised
anxiety
disorder,
panic
disorder,
phobias
(classified
as
agoraphobia, social phobia and simple phobia), obsessive–
compulsive
disorder
(OCD);
and
(iii)
mixed
anxiety/
depressive disorder. The latter include those who scored
above the case threshold on the CIS-R, but do not meet
diagnostic criteria for any other ICD-10 disorder.
(c) The Psychosis Screening Questionnaire (PSQ) is a brief
schedule that screens for symptoms commonly found in
psychotic
disorders.18
Rather
than
making
a
definitive
diagnosis, it indicates whether a psychotic disorder may be
present.
(d) A shortened version of the Close Persons Questionnaire that
evaluates social support.19 This had been used in previous
national surveys.9,17 Seven questions enquire about the level of
intimacy and social support from close friends and family.
The answers are scored from one to three and are summed to
a total score; higher scores indicate higher social support.
(e) The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)
questionnaire is a widely used and well validated instrument
that contains 10 questions about use of, and attitudes to,
alcohol consumption, in this instance over the preceding 12
months.20,21 Men who scored more than seven and women
who scored more than four were classified as hazardous drinkers.
(f) The Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ)22 was used to
collect
information
on
the
presence
of
trauma-related
symptoms in the past week. A traumatic event is one in
which a person experiences, witnesses or is confronted with
a death or a serious injury or threat to self or close others.
It is more severe than a stressful life event. Scoring positively
on this questionnaire indicates the presence of trauma-
related symptoms in the preceding week and that a clinical
assessment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is
warranted; it does not specify a diagnosis of PTSD, in
particular because it evaluates only two of the four criteria
taken to identify a traumatising event. As a screening tool it
has
high
sensitivity
and
specificity
but
lower
positive
predictive value (0.48) as a result of the usually low prevalence
of PTSD (1%) in most populations.22
(g) The SCOFF is a five-item screening tool for anorexia and bulimia
nervosa that enquires about eating attitudes and behaviour over
the preceding year.23 Endorsement of two or more items
represented a positive screening for an eating disorder. A
further question (‘in the last year . . . did your feelings
about food interfere with your ability to work, meet personal
responsibilities, and/or enjoy a social life?’) was added to judge
the impact of such eating attitudes and behaviour.
(h) Problem gambling is gambling to a degree that compromises,
disrupts or damages family, personal or recreational pursuits.
This categorisation was based on the DSM-IV24 criteria for
problem and pathological gambling. Participants who met
three or more of these diagnostic criteria were classified as
problem gamblers.
(i) Questions on use of recreational drugs came from the
Diagnostic Interview Schedule.25 Use of a drug in the past
year and the presence of one of five symptoms were used to
indicate drug dependence. Dependence was categorised as
dependence on cannabis only and dependence on other
drugs (with or without cannabis dependence).
(j) One question explored how happy the participants felt
ranging from very, to fairly and not too happy.
(k) Finally, one binary variable summarised whether or not the
respondent was taking any form of psychotropic medication
69
Religion, spirituality and mental health
 King et al
and one summarised whether or not they were receiving any
form of psychotherapy or counselling.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted in Stata release 12.0, for Windows,
using the survey command to account for the unequal probability
of selection and to adjust the standard errors to account for
clustering in areas sampled in data collection. Our main
analyses concerned possible associations between holding a
religious, spiritual or secular life view and: receiving counselling/
psychotherapy or psychotropic medication for a mental disorder;
mental disorders classified by the CIS-R; possible PTSD, psychosis
or an eating disorder; hazardous drinking; recreational drug use
and dependence; and level of happiness.
We explored these associations using logistic regression, except
for happiness, which utilised ordered logistic regression and
for drug dependence where multinomial logistic regression was
used. We adjusted for gender, age group, ethnicity, educational
attainment, marital status or perceived social support if they were
significantly associated with the given outcome. Social support is
known to be associated with religious belief and practice.26,27 The
reference group chosen for these analyses were participants
reporting a secular (neither religious nor spiritual) life view, given
it was the largest and most distinct of the three groups in terms of
absence of any spiritual belief.
Results
Response rates and description of the population
A total of 9% of sampled addresses contained no private
households and 4% were addresses of unknown eligibility. This
left a known eligible sample of 12 694 addresses. Applying the
eligibility rate among those where it was established, to those
where it was not, it was estimated that 91% of those of unknown
eligibility would have been eligible to take part. This increased the
set sample of households to 13 171. In total, 7403 respondents
(56.2%) provided a productive interview. The mean age of
the participants was 46.3 years (s.e.= 0.28, unweighted range
16–97), 4206 (51.4%) were women, 85% were White British,
26% had no educational qualifications and 52% were married
(online Table DS1).
Understanding of life
Of the participants 35% had a religious understanding of life, 19%
were spiritual (without religious participation) and 46% were
neither religious nor spiritual in outlook (online Table DS1). In
total 53% gave a nominal religious affiliation, with the majority
citing Christianity (86%). Demographic characteristics of the
sample stratified by understanding of life are shown in Table 1.
People
with
no
religious
or
spiritual
understanding
were
significantly younger and more often White British, but were less
likely to have qualifications beyond secondary school or to be
married. Religious people had stronger beliefs and placed more
importance on practice of those beliefs than people with a purely
spiritual understanding (Table 1).
Mental disorders and substance use
People with a religious understanding of life were less likely to use
or be dependent on drugs, or be hazardous drinkers (Table 2).
People with a spiritual understanding of life were more likely to
have abnormal eating attitudes and any neurotic disorder. There

a. Only applicable for those who are religious or spiritual.
 Religion, spirituality and mental health
were no differences in overall happiness or level of social support.
People with no religious or spiritual understanding were least
likely to be taking psychotropic medication.
Comparison of groups after adjustment for other
influences
In a multivariate regression, we selected those people with neither
a religious nor spiritual understanding of life (the largest group)
to serve as a reference against which to compare the other two
groups, namely those with a religious understanding and those
with a spiritual understanding of life. After adjustment for
important associated influences, there were few substantial
differences in prevalence of mental disorder or receipt of
treatment between people with no religious or spiritual under-
standing and those who were religious, except for less drug use
and hazardous drinking in the latter (Table 3). However, people
with a spiritual understanding were more likely than those who
were
neither
religious
nor
spiritual
to
take
psychotropic
medication, to use recreational drugs or be dependent on them,
to have a generalised anxiety disorder, phobia or any neurotic
disorder or to have abnormal eating attitudes.
Discussion
Main findings
Our main finding is that people who had a spiritual under-
standing of life had worse mental health than those with an
understanding that was neither religious nor spiritual. Those
who were religious were broadly similar, in terms of prevalence
of mental disorder and use of mental health treatments, to those
who were neither religious nor spiritual after adjustment for
potential confounders, except they were significantly less likely
to use, or be dependent on, drugs or alcohol. This supports
evidence from a national UK sample of people from a range of
Black and minority ethnic groups9 on the vulnerability of people
who describe themselves as spiritual. It adds to the evidence that
people with a spiritual understanding in the absence of a religious
framework appear to have the worst mental health. It also
confirms that religious people are less likely to use alcohol28 and
recreational drugs29 but fails to confirm North American evidence
that holding a religious understanding of life provides protection
against mental disorders.30 It also concurs with other evidence
from England that there is no clear relationship between religiosity
and happiness.31
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of this study are the random selection of a nationally
representative sample of participants, the sample size, an in-depth
assessment of mental health and the use of standardised questions
on religion and spirituality that were developed and standardised
in the UK and do not overlap with questions on well-being.
However, there are also a number of limitations. First, our results
depend on the definitions of religion and spirituality that were
posed to participants. Although spirituality is notoriously difficult
to define,32 this way of describing it to research participants has at
least been shown to be reliable.12,13 However, we did not examine
religious belief in detail, nor to what extent it was intrinsic or
extrinsic.33 Second, the cross-sectional nature of the data means

that we cannot attribute cause and effect to any relationship
between spiritual beliefs and mental health.
Comparison with findings from other studies
A recent large USA internet survey of people who regarded
themselves as non-religious34 also reported that non-religious
people who held spiritual beliefs (only 2% of the survey
population) had less emotional stability as measured by a
personality rating scale. However, it is difficult to know how far
we can compare such people with our spiritual group, which made
up 19% of the study population. Although the authors concluded
that belief is a measure of negative personality traits, their findings
(and ours) are in opposition to earlier evidence from the UK that
spirituality is associated with greater extraversion and optimism
(rather than neuroticism and psychoticism), particularly among
men.35 The limitation of the latter study, however was that it
was based on a volunteer student population and is therefore
unlikely to be generalisable. Another possible explanation for
our finding concerning people with a spiritual life view is that they
are caught up in an existential search that is driven by their
emotional distress.9,36
Why might findings in Europe concerning the emotional
stability of religious people vary from those in the USA? There
is considerable evidence that the UK is a less religious country
than the USA in terms of the number of people professing a belief
in God or attending places of worship.37 We found that a relatively
low number of people expressed some sort of spiritual or religious
belief in this survey (54%) in comparison with that found in
recent surveys both in the UK and around the world where levels
have been closer to 70%.38,39 Given that religious participation in
English society is a minority activity, it may be that the social
support intrinsic to a more religious society is missing. A further
possibility is the way in which we measured spiritual and religious
understanding. The Royal Free Interview for Religious and
Spiritual Beliefs was developed and standardised in the UK and
has not been used extensively in the USA. However, this is not
strictly a limitation as one could argue that instruments should
be most appropriate to the setting in which they were developed.
Certainly, the difference in the findings concerning religion and
mental health between the USA and the UK would bear greater
investigation.
We conclude that there is increasing evidence that people who
profess spiritual beliefs in the absence of a religious framework are
more vulnerable to mental disorder. The nature of this association
needs greater examination in qualitative and in prospective
quantitative research.
