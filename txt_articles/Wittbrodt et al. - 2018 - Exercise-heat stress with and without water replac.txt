Abstract
Effects of exercise-heat stress with and without water replacement on brain
structure and visuomotor performance were examined. Thirteen healthy adults
(23.6 � 4.2 years) completed counterbalanced 150 min trials of exercise-heat
stress (45°C, 15% RH) with water replacement (EHS) or without (~3% body
mass loss; EHS-DEH) compared to seated rest (CON). Anatomical scans and
fMRI Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent responses during a visuomotor pacing
task were evaluated. Accuracy decreased (P < 0.05) despite water replacement
during EHS (�8.2 � 6.8% vs. CON) but further degraded with EHS-DEH
(�8.3 � 6.4% vs. EHS and �16.5 � 10.2% vs. CON). Relative to CON, EHS
elicited
opposing
volumetric
changes
(P < 0.05)
in
brain
ventricles
(�5.3 � 1.7%) and periventricular structures (cerebellum: 1.5 � 0.8%) com-
pared to EHS-DEH (ventricles: 6.8 � 3.4, cerebellum: �0.7 � 0.7; thalamus:
�2.7 � 1.3%). Changes in plasma osmolality (EHS: �3.0 � 2.1; EHS-DEH:
9.3 � 2.1 mOsm/kg) were related (P < 0.05) to thalamus (r = �0.45) and
cerebellum volume (r = �0.61) which, in turn, were related (P < 0.05) to lat-
eral (r = �0.41) and fourth ventricle volume (r = �0.67) changes, respec-
tively; but, there were no associations (P > 0.50) between structural changes
and visuomotor accuracy. EHS-DEH increased neural activation (P < 0.05)
within motor and visual areas versus EHS and CON. Brain structural changes
are related to bidirectional plasma osmolality perturbations resulting from
exercise-heat stress (with and without water replacement), but do not explain
visuomotor impairments. Negative impacts of exercise-heat stress on visuomo-
tor tasks are further exacerbated by dehydration.
Introduction
Prevention of significant dehydration by replacing fluids
during exercise in the heat attenuates adverse physiologi-
cal effects such as reduced aerobic performance (Kenefick
2018). Since dehydration is a common stressor occurring
with prolonged heat exposure in various occupational
and military settings, whether fluid replacement mitigates
cognitive-motor deficits is also an important question.
Despite
inconclusive
scientific
evidence
(IOM,
2004;
Cheuvront and Kenefick 2014), it is commonly suggested
that dehydration adversely impacts cognitive-motor and
central nervous system function. However, conflicting
findings exist regarding the impact of dehydration on
cognitive-motor performance, with some studies observ-
ing marked impairments (Sharma et al. 1986; Gopinathan

 et al. 1988; Cian et al. 2000; Baker et al. 2007a; Watson
et al. 2015), others no differences (Hogervorst et al. 1996;
Szinnai et al. 2005; Adam et al. 2008; Armstrong et al.
2012; Ely et al. 2013; Wittbrodt et al. 2015b; van den
Heuvel et al. 2017), and even one with improved perfor-
mance (Bandelow et al. 2010). No singular explanation
accounts for these disparate results; but, explanations
likely include inconsistencies within the assessed cogni-
tive-motor domains coupled with study design considera-
tions such as the magnitude of body water deficit and the
method used to induce dehydration (i.e., sweat loss due
to exercise and/ or heat stress).
Previous studies examining the effects of dehydration
on cognitive-motor function typically assess performance
with computerized tasks utilizing a higher-order cognitive
domain (e.g., executive control, information processing,
memory) that require a motor response (e.g., button
press). While these assessments hold value, they may
assess overly broad cognitive-motor functions. Tasks iso-
lating visuomotor responses allow researchers to examine
the influence of a cognitive system (vision) on motor
function through networks involving visual cortex, senso-
rimotor areas, parietal cortex, and basal ganglia (Fitts
1954; Cisek and Kalaska 2010). Some studies have sug-
gested motor coordination may be impaired following
dehydration (Cian et al. 2000); however, a primary com-
ponent of visuomotor functioning, the ability to accu-
rately process temporal information (Buhusi and Meck
2005), has not been previously examined. Adequate visuo-
motor performance is essential to human-system interac-
tions,
and
dysfunction
(potentially
from
deficient
visuomotor timing) might explain errant performance in
tasks such as driving proficiency (Watson et al. 2015),
pilot simulations (Lindseth et al. 2013), and sporting
skills (Baker et al. 2007b; Smith et al. 2012) are degraded
following dehydration.
Controversy
also
exists
whether
dehydration
alters
brain water content and anatomical structures. Early ani-
mal autopsy studies observed no changes in brain volume
following severe dehydration (�10% of body mass, BM)
(Falck and Scheffer 1854; Nose et al. 1983) suggesting
homeostatic neural mechanisms adequately offset large
perturbations to body water balance (Gullans and Ver-
balis 1993; De Petris et al. 2001). Subsequent human
in vivo neuroimaging studies usually confirm total brain
volume is not altered with dehydration (Dickson et al.
2005; Kempton et al. 2009; Watson et al. 2010; Nakamura
et al. 2014; Meyers et al. 2016); however, lateral ventricle
volume is observed to either expand (Kempton et al.
2009, 2011a), shrink (Watson et al. 2010), or not change
(Dickson et al. 2005; Streitburger et al. 2012; Meyers
et al. 2016). Lateral ventricle expansion is also associated
with cognitive-motor decrements during aging and/or
neurological disturbances and likely attributed to adjacent
periventricular
gray
matter
atrophy
(Johnstone
et al.
1976; Coffey et al. 1992; Breteler et al. 1994). To date,
only one study examined white and gray matter following
dehydration, finding no volumetric change with ~2% BM
loss achieved with fluid restriction (Streitburger et al.
2012). Furthermore, the other previous magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) studies employing fluid restriction
or exercise-heat stress protocols have induced nominal
dehydration (<2% BM loss) (Kempton et al. 2011a; Mey-
ers et al. 2016) or have not controlled for the effects of
prior exercise-heat stress using only a preexercise rest
condition (Kempton et al. 2009; Watson et al. 2010) or
an exercise protocol with less thermal stress (Kempton
et al. 2011a). Therefore, the known impact of dehydration
as a result of exercise-heat stress on brain structures
remains elusive.
Thus, a comprehensive study is needed to examine: (1)
whether dehydration due to exercise-heat stress alters
brain structures and impairs fundamental visuomotor
performance, and (2) if prevention of dehydration via
water replacement during exercise-heat stress attenuates
structural and functional changes. Given the prevalence of
studies employing the exercise-heat stress method for
dehydration and variability of findings reporting either
impairments (Sharma et al. 1986; Gopinathan et al. 1988;
Baker et al. 2007a; Tomporowski et al. 2007) or no effect
(Serwah and Marino 2006; Morley et al. 2012; Ely et al.
2013) on performance across multiple cognitive-motor
domains, we utilized this method relevant across multiple
scenarios (military, athletic, occupational) and, specifi-
cally, at a level of dehydration known to elicit homeo-
static responses (Cheuvront et al. 2013). Based upon our
recent
meta-analysis
(Wittbrodt
and
Millard-Stafford
2018), we hypothesized dehydration would impair perfor-
mance during a prolonged visuomotor task, but water
replacement during exercise-heat stress would mitigate
visuomotor impairment. Secondly, we hypothesized dehy-
dration would alter brain structures by expanding ventric-
ular volume as observed in some (but not all) previous
studies due to fluid movements across compartments,
and these changes would be associated with reduced
visuomotor performance.

teen

(six
female)
healthy
adults
(age:
23.6 � 4.2 year, body mass: 61.3 � 6.0 kg, body fat:
15.2 � 3.0%) participated in the study. Subjects were
excluded if they were taking any medication, had any
neurological condition, or metal in their body. Although
fitness status was not assessed, all subjects were recre-
ationally active, engaged in regular exercise (≥4 day/
week). All subjects served as their own control and com-
pleted each condition.
Experimental design
Thirteen subjects completed three preliminary sessions
and three experimental trials (within ~2 weeks). Subjects
were tested in Atlanta, GA, during the nonsummer
months of either March–May or October–December (and
therefore were assumed to not be heat acclimated).
Female subjects were tested during the follicular phase of
the menstrual cycle (or for n = 2, the first 10 days of
their oral contraceptive pill pack) based on self-reported
history. Before all sessions, subjects were instructed to
consume liberal (>500 mL) and consistent fluid the night
before, abstain from alcohol and caffeine for the previous
12 h, and enter the laboratory after an overnight fast.
During the 24 h prior to testing, subjects were asked to
avoid heat exposure and exercise beyond normal daily
activities. Three preliminary sessions were conducted to
establish baseline body mass (BM), plasma osmolality
(POsm), and urine specific gravity (USG; ATAGO USA,
Bellevue, WA) as previously recommended (Cheuvront
and Kenefick 2014). During one preliminary session, an
exercise-heat bout was completed by subjects to estimate
sweat rate and verify workload (treadmill velocity and
grade) for the experimental trials.
Following the preliminary sessions, subjects completed
three experimental trials: control (CON; no exercise-heat
stress), exercise-heat stress with fluid replacement (EHS),
and exercise-heat stress with dehydration (EHS-DEH;
exercise-heat stress without fluid replacement). The order
of experimental trials (EHS and EHS-DEH) was counter-
balanced, but CON usually occurred first (n = 7) due to
scheduling constraints in the MRI facility. The experi-
mental trials were initiated in the morning (~0700) and
first
morning
BM,
USG
(<1.021),
and
POsm
(<290 mOsm/kg) (Cheuvront et al. 2010) were assessed
to ensure adequate hydration status (≤1% difference in
BM from preceding 3 days average) (Cheuvront et al.
2010). Subjects then consumed a nutrition bar (250 kcal)
and water (150 mL) 20 min before entering the hot
(EHS, EHS-DEH; 45°C, 15% RH) or temperate (CON;
22°C, 30% RH) environments. For EHS and EHS-DEH,
the
exercise
mirrored
previous
exercise-heat
stress
protocols (Francesconi et al. 1983; Sawka et al. 1985;
Cheuvront et al. 2010; Ely et al. 2013) consisting of
150 min (45 min walk/15 min rest cycles) on a treadmill
at ~3.5 mph, 5% grade. This method using an intermit-
tent exercise protocol with recovery periods (including
5 min in a cool room to obtain hourly body mass
throughout) was selected to elicit dehydration (3% BM
loss) at modest HR (initial HR of ~120 bt/min) while
minimizing excessive elevations in core temperature as
demonstrated previously (Ely et al. 2013). During EHS,
subjects consumed a volume of water equivalent to sweat
loss, while no water was consumed during EHS-DEH
(only mouth rinse permitted once per hour). Following
EHS and EHS-DEH, subjects had a 30 min recovery
(moved to the temperate environment with cold packs
applied to skin) prior to a final BM, blood glucose and
POsm. Subjects then showered, changed into dry clothes,
and were transported to the MRI facility (~5 min away)
with a total recovery period of 45 min. This extended
recovery/shower period was similar to one previously
employed (Ely et al. 2013) to decrease skin and core tem-
peratures. During CON, subjects reported under the same
baseline conditions with meal provided but instead of
walking in the heat, sat quietly for ~1.5 h in the temper-
ate environment while abstaining from mentally stimulat-
ing activities before being transported to the MRI for
scanning at the same time of day (~1100).
Physiological and perceptual measures
During all exercise trials, heart rate (HR) and rectal tem-
perature (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH) were measured at 5 min
intervals, and did not exceed 90% of age-predicted HRmax
(220-age) or 39.5°C, respectively. Blood samples were
obtained by finger puncture on a heated digit after being
seated for 10 min. POsm was determined from the median
of at least three measurements (median of five if variation
exceeded 1%) using freeze point depression (Osmette II,
Precision Systems, Natick, MA) as described previously
(Wittbrodt et al. 2015a). Blood glucose was measured
(OneTouch UltraMini, LifeScan Inc., Wayne, PA) postexer-
cise (~3 h after the meal) for EHS-DEH and EHS and
~ 90 min after the meal for CON. Nude, dry BM was mea-
sured before and after each hour period of exercise on a
digital platform scale and corrected for urine output.
During EHS-DEH, subjects were blinded to their BM.
Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) (Borg 1982) and thirst
(1–10 Likert scale) were also assessed at 5 min interval.
MRI scanning and visuomotor task
Subjects were placed in the 3T MRI (Siemens Trio, Sie-
mens, Germany) scanner with the 12-channel head coil

 affixed and head position in a way to minimize move-
ment in the X, Y, or Z axes. The scanning sequence con-
sisted
of
a
T1-MPRAGE
with
256
slices
and
1.0 9 1.0 9 1.0 mm voxel size (TA: 6.17 sec, 9° flip
angle, TI: 850 msec, TR: 2250 msec; TE: 3.98 msec) and
a T2 Space with 1.0 9 1.0 9 1.0 mm voxel size (TA:
4.43 sec, TR: 3200 msec, TE: 428 msec). In between the
T1 and T2 scan, subjects completed the motor pacing task
(described
below)
during
which
Blood-Oxygen-Level-
Dependent (BOLD) responses were measured using an
echo-planar imaging sequence with a total of 714 volumes
(37
slides;
Tr = 2000 msec,
TE = 30 msec,
flip
angle = 90°, field of view = 204 9 204 mm2, in-plane
resolution of 3 9 3 mm2, slice thickness: 3.0 mm). Each
fMRI
scanning
(n = 2)
block
lasted
approximately
11 min.
During the functional MRI (fMRI) scanning, subjects
completed a visuomotor pacing task (VMPT; E*Prime,
Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA) requiring visu-
ally-paced rhythmic finger tapping with the right index
finger. In the scanner, subjects lay supine and viewed a
display monitor (Silent Vision 6011, Avotec, Stuart, FL)
via a mirror placed on the head coil. Headphones (Silent
Scan 3100, Avotec, Stuart, FL) were placed on the subject
and adequate visibility of the monitor was confirmed
before each scan. If required, vision was corrected using
MRI-compatible lenses. Due to budget restrictions, several
subjects (n = 3) did not undergo MRI scanning, and
instead completed the VMPT in a MRI simulator (Psy-
chology Software Tools, Sharpsberg, PA) built to mimic
conditions within the MRI scanner (i.e., supine position,
enclosed space, head coil). Thus, full behavioral data were
obtained on 13 subjects, but fMRI imaging (for anatomi-
cal and BOLD responses) on only 10.
The VMPT consisted of 1 Hz alternating stimuli (yel-
low square presented for 500 msec) and fixation crosses
(i.e., interstimulus interval) with two pacing variations:
(1) regularly paced (VMPTr; fixation cross for 500 msec)
and (2) irregularly paced (VMPTi; fixation cross pre-
sented for 400–600 msec). Subjects were instructed to
respond to the stimulus (yellow square) by pressing a
button box (FORP 4 Diamond, Current Designs, Philadel-
phia, PA). Errors were encoded binomially: “0” (missed
response) or “1” (correct response). Blocks of thirty
stimuli (all either VMPTr or VMPTi) were followed by
30 sec
rest.
Twenty
total
blocks
were
completed
(n = 600 stimuli) with extended (120 sec) rest periods
every
five
blocks,
with
total
test
duration
equaling
~22 min. Block presentation (VMPTr or VMPTi) was
randomized for each test iteration. Two behavioral mea-
sures
were
examined:
accuracy
(percentage
correct
responses) and reaction time (latency from stimulus pre-
sentation to button press). The nature of the VMPT
dictated that only correct responses could be examined
for reaction time. Both reaction time and accuracy were
averaged across 5-min blocks of time. Previous research
has identified tasks with parameters of the VMPT (i.e.,
1 Hz single digit finger tapping with one stimulus-
response combination) are not affected by learning or
trial order (Bove et al. 2007).
Anatomical analyses
Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation were
performed using the Freesurfer image analysis pipeline
(surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). Briefly, the pipeline involves
cortical surface extraction and “skull-stripping” (removal
of extracerebral voxels), gray/white matter segmentation
based on intensity differences and geometric structures,
computing planes to anatomically disconnect the two
hemispheres and subcortical structures, computing a pial
surface (smooth gray-white matter interface), and correct-
ing inter-individual topological defects in surface by com-
puting a spherical topology (Dale et al. 1999; Fischl et al.
1999). Furthermore, because dura and gray matter are
difficult to distinguish with a T1 image, a T2 scan was
provided to refine the estimate of the pial surface and
registered
with
the
T1
image
using
boundary-based
registration (Greve and Fischl 2009) provided as part
of FreeSurfer (surfer.nmr.mhg.harvard/fswiki/FsFast). The
Freesurfer anatomical pipeline is capable of detecting sub-
millimeter differences between groups and has an inter-
class correlation of >0.95 and reproducibility >0.99 in
measuring
lateral
ventricle
volume
(Kempton
et al.
2011b). Because of large inter-individual variability and
sex-specific differences in some brain regions (e.g., lateral
ventricles) (Allen et al. 2002; Pletzer et al. 2010), a rela-
tive change (compared to CON) was computed for each
area (% change = (([trial]�CON)/CON)*100).
BOLD analysis
fMRI data analysis was completed using FSL (www.fmrib.
ox.ac.uk/fsl) (Smith et al. 2004). All data were prepro-
cessed by motion correcting images (MCFLIRT) (Jenkin-
son et al. 2002), removing non-brain tissue (BET) (Smith
2002), distortion-corrected with a fMRI field map using
PRELUDE
and
FUGE
(Smith
et al.
2004),
spatially
smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width
half
maximum,
and
high
pass
temporal
filtering
(sigma = 100 sec). First level fixed effects (time-series)
analysis was completed with a generalized linear model
(FILM) including nonparametric estimation of time series
autocorrelation (Woolrich et al. 2001). fMRI data for
each subject were analyzed in native space (i.e., individual
subject brain) before being initially registered to their

 own high resolution structural image and then subject to
a nonlinear registration to standard MNI space (MNI152,
Montreal
Neurological
Institute;
Montreal,
Quebec,
Canada) using FNIRT. All BOLD signals were measured
as signal intensity compared to the rest periods. Time ser-
ies analysis was completed with the contrasts of the entire
task (VMPTr and VMPTi).
Second-level analyses (i.e., across subjects and sessions)
were completed using mixed effects (FLAME 1+2) which
uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to identify true
random-effect variance and degrees of freedom for each
voxel. The main analysis examined the BOLD responses
of the VMPT during each session and was restricted to
gray matter voxels. To compare across sessions, Z-statistic
images were produced by applying a cluster threshold of
Z ≥ 2.5 and (corrected) cluster significance threshold of
P = 0.01 (Worsley et al. 1992). Contiguous clusters were
identified using the Z statistic and then compared with
the cluster probability threshold. Significant clusters were
binarized and fed into the atlas query function of FSL.
Cluster peaks and anatomical locations were localized in
MNI152
space using
the Lateralized
Harvard-Oxford
Cortical Structural Atlas within the cortex and Harvard-
Oxford
Subcortical
Structural
Atlas
for
subcortical
structures. Statistical maps were overlaid onto a standard
brain template using MRIcron (Rorden et al. 2007) with
a threshold of Z ≥ 2.5. In addition, BOLD responses
required for task completion were visualized during CON
with a threshold of Z ≥ 1.6.
Statistical analysis
All power analyses were computed to detect power of 0.8
at an alpha level of 0.05 using a repeated measures
ANOVA with three comparisons (CON, EHS, EHS-
DEH). For brain anatomical changes, a power analysis
was conducted using data from a previous study examin-
ing lateral ventricular volume changes following ~2% BM
loss (Kempton et al. 2009). Using the reported effect size
(0.37) between control and dehydration conditions along
with a correlation among measures of 0.8 (given the high
reliability as previously described), it was determined that
a sample size of n = 7 was required (G*Power 3.1.9.2,
gpower.hhu.de). For cognitive performance changes, 11
subjects were required based upon the calculated effect
size (0.43) from previous motor coordination task data
following ~3% BM loss (Cian et al. 2000) compared to
an EHS trial (estimated within-measures correlation of
0.5).
Physiological and perceptual variables (POsm, BM,
USG, thirst, RPE, core temperature) were analyzed using
a mixed model with repeated measures of trial (CON,
EHS, EHS-DEH) and time (e.g., pre, post) within the
nlme package of R (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme).
Relative change in brain areas were analyzed using a
mixed model with repeated measure of trial. VMPT accu-
racy and reaction time were analyzed using a mixed
model with repeated measures of trial, task version
(VMPTr, VMPTi), and time block (first and last 5 min).
For physiological, perceptual, visuomotor performance,
and brain structural changes, if a significant main or
interaction effect was observed, post-hoc contrasts using
Bonferroni-Holm corrections were calculated using the
lsmeans
package
in
R
(cran.r-project.org/web/packages/
lsmeans). Associations between changes in brain structures
and plasma osmolality/VMPT were computed using one-
tail (negative association) Pearson product-moment cor-
relation coefficients. The alpha level was set a priori as
P ≤ 0.05 to indicate statistical significance. Data are pre-

was higher (P = 0.001) than EHS but not different from

Exercise-Heat Stress Alters Visuomotor Performance
 Visuomotor performance: reaction time
Testing order across all three trials did not affect VMPT
reaction
time
(Trial
1:
165.4 � 27.4,
Trial
2:
160.8 � 27.0;
Trial
3:
152.3 � 26.9 msec;
P = 0.23).
Reaction time was slower for irregularly paced (VMPTi)
versus
regularly
paced
(VMPTr)
intervals
(by
16.6 � 7.2 msec, P < 0.001) and slower over time during
the first 5 min block compared to the last 5 min block
(by 22.3 � 7.3 msec, P < 0.001). However, reaction time
was not different among trials (CON: 168.9 � 26.4, EHS:
159.9 � 26.9, EHS-DEH: 160.2 � 24.8 msec; P = 0.54).
Visuomotor performance: accuracy
Testing order across all three trials did not affect VMPT
accuracy (Trial 1: 83.5 � 9.2, Trial 2: 79.7 � 10.9; Trial
3: 78.6 � 10.5%; P = 0.65). Accuracy was not different
based on the test pacing intervals (VMPTr: 78.5 � 13.8%,
VMPTi: 75.7 � 11.1%, P = 0.09) or a pacing interval by
trial interaction (P = 0.28). Therefore, VMPT data were
pooled across regular and irregular paced tasks. Over
20 min,
accuracy
was
lower
during
EHS-DEH
(69.7 � 13.5%)
compared
to
CON
(85.1 � 7.0%,
P = 0.008) and EHS (77.9 � 10.3%; P = 0.02). Accuracy
was also lower during EHS compared to CON (P = 0.03).
Figure 1 presents VMPT accuracy during the first and last
5-min time blocks across trials. As early as 5 min, EHS-
DEH impaired accuracy compared to both CON (by
�15.4 � 9.3%, P = 0.003) and EHS (by �6.9 � 6.2%,
P = 0.03), and EHS compared to CON (by �8.5 � 6.4%,
P = 0.02). Accuracy was reduced over time from the first
5 min block compared to the last 5 min (by 9.2 � 3.3%,
P < 0.0001), although no time by trial interaction was
observed (P = 0.58).
Brain anatomical changes
Total brain volume (all tissues including cerebellum and
ventricles but excluding the dura mater) was obtained
from a data set of n = 10 (five females) and not different
among trials (P = 0.26). Total intracranial volume (total
brain volume and sinus areas) was not different between
CON and EHS-DEH (P = 0.96); but increased during
EHS versus CON (by 1.49 � 0.8%, P < 0.0001). The fol-
lowing brain structures were not significantly (P > 0.05)
altered by the experimental trials: total gray matter, corti-
cal gray matter, cerebellar white matter, nucleus accum-
bens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, putamen, ventral
dorsal column, brain stem, and choroid plexus.
Table 1 provides the brain structure changes associated
with the experimental trials. EHS (vs. CON) increased
(P < 0.05)
volumes
of
the
cortical
white
matter,
cerebellum, globus pallidus, and cerebellar gray matter
(between ~1 and ~5%); but decreased ventricular volume
and nonventricular cerebral spinal fluid (between 5 and
6%). In direct contrast to this, EHS-DEH (vs. CON)
increased volume of the ventricles and nonventricular
cerebral spinal fluid (by 6.0–6.8%), but also decreased
volume of the cerebellum (by 0.7%), subcortical gray
matter (by 1.1%), and thalamus (by 2.7%). In addition,
EHS-DEH (vs. EHS) decreased volume of cortical white
matter, subcortical gray matter, cerebellum, cerebellar
gray matter, and corpus callosum.
Figure 2 provides the mean and individual data for
selected anatomical sites (cerebellar gray matter, thalamus,
all ventricles, nonventricular CSF) to illustrate this dichot-
omy between trials. EHS consistently increased cerebral
gray matter and thalamus volume (assumed fluid gain).
EHS-DEH consistently decreased tissue volume (assumed
fluid loss) concomitant with ventricular volume changes
in the opposite direction (i.e., reduction with EHS, pre-
sumably as surrounding tissues gained fluid, and expan-
sion with EHS-DEH, as surrounding tissues crenate from
fluid loss).
Figure 3A–D presents the relationship between changes
in specific brain structures (thalamus, cerebellum) with
their adjacent ventricles and change in POsm. Change in
POsm was inversely correlated with changes in cerebellum
(r = �0.61, P = 0.005), cerebellar gray matter (r = �0.63,
P = 0.003), and thalamus (r = �0.45, P = 0.04) volumes
but directly associated with changes in total ventricular
(r = 0.74, P = 0.0002) and nonventricular cerebrospinal
fluid volumes (r = 0.70, P = 0.0006). Moreover, lateral
ventricle
(r = �0.41;
P = 0.04)
and
fourth
ventricle
(r = �0.67;
P = 0.0006)
expansion
were
significantly
associated with reductions in thalamus and cerebellum
volume, respectively. Figure 3E–F present a scatter plot
illustrating the
nonsignificant
(P > 0.50)
relationships
between changes in thalamus and cerebellum volume and
changes in VMPT accuracy. VMPT accuracy was also not
associated with changes in POsm (r = 0.08, P = 0.38).
Brain function via BOLD during VMPT
Figure 4 presents BOLD responses obtained from a data
set of n = 10 (five females) during CON to illustrate the
task-dependent neural resource requirements during the
entire 20-min VMPT (combining regular and irregular
variations). Elevated BOLD responses were observed for
the following brain areas: left sensorimotor, bilateral sup-
plementary motor, bilateral thalamus, bilateral putamen,
bilateral caudate, right frontal pole, bilateral middle and
superior frontal gyri, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus,
left frontal, central, and right operculum, and bilateral
insula.

Discussion
Dehydration is a common perturbation in occupational,
military, and athletic populations who perform cognitive-
motor tasks. Early research observed dehydration alters
multiple cognitive-motor domains (Sharma et al. 1986;
Gopinathan et al. 1988), however, many subsequent stud-
ies have not supported this position (Adam et al. 2008;
Ely et al. 2013; van den Heuvel et al. 2017) and potential
mechanisms
responsible
remain
elusive.
Our
data
uniquely addressed if changes in brain structures due to
dehydration (at levels known to induce physiological
compensation) were aligned with performance impair-
ments and altered neural processing during a fundamen-
tal, prolonged visuomotor task. Visuomotor timing, a
core tenant of visuomotor function (Buhusi and Meck
2005), was selected, as it is a critical component for occu-
pational, military, and athletic tasks at a required motor
output at ~1 Hz, the frequency at which human motor
control operates (Buhusi and Meck 2005).
Our major finding was that exercise-heat stress (despite
water
ingestion
matching
sweat
loss)
significantly
impaired visuomotor performance by 8% which was fur-
ther exacerbated with dehydration by another 8%. There-
fore, we accept our hypothesis that dehydration impairs
visuomotor performance. Our recent meta-analysis identi-
fied that visuomotor performance is impaired by dehy-
dration (Wittbrodt and Millard-Stafford 2018), however
not all individual studies have supported this finding
(Cian et al. 2001) despite similar body water deficits.
Interestingly, visuomotor impairments were demonstrated
within the initial 5 min of our timed finger-tapping task.
The VMPT, although a “simple” task not requiring execu-
tive or higher-order processing, is a prolonged monoto-
nous
task
containing
only
one
stimulus,
thus
characteristic of tasks which stress attentional capacity
(Sturm and Willmes 2001). Although dehydration per se
did not alter the rate of performance decline over time
(~9% over the 20 min across all trials including resting
control), we cannot exclude the possibility that perfor-
mance impairments following both exercise-heat stress
trials are partially explained by a diminished capacity of
visual-spatial resources.
Our study corroborates others observing that dehydra-
tion does not reduce total brain volume (Kempton et al.
2009, 2011a; Watson et al. 2010; Meyers et al. 2016), but
provides novel information regarding changes to brain

 ventricular shrinkage as a consequence of overall hypov-
olemia (Watson et al. 2010) or (2) ventricular expansion
via an ex vacuo mechanism resulting from osmotic gradi-
ents drawing fluid out of the intracellular spaces (Kemp-
ton et al. 2009). Our findings support the ex vacuo
expansion of the ventricular system during dehydration
with hypotonic sweat. POsm increases also may elevate
cerebrospinal fluid osmolality (Pape and Katzman 1970;
Szczepa�
nska-Sadowska et al. 1984), as the choroid plexus
secretes a fluid isotonic to blood plasma (DiMattio et al.
1975). Hypertonic cerebrospinal fluid decreases choroid
plexus bulk flow, potentially to maintain total brain vol-
ume, as evidenced by shrinking total brain volume,
although
only
reported
with
severely
elevated
cere-
brospinal
fluid
osmolality
(+45 mOsm/kg)
(DiMattio
et al. 1975). This mechanism likely explains why total
brain volume was unchanged following hypertonic hypov-
olemia (POsm elevation) but ventricular volume/nonven-
tricular cerebrospinal fluid expanded and were associated
with shrinkage of the periventricular structures.
In contrast to our hypothesis, when preventing dehy-
dration during exercise in the heat (water replacement to
match 100% sweat loss), plasma osmolality was reduced
(~3 mOsm/kg) with the unexpected finding of opposing
changes to brain structures (e.g., ventricular volume con-
striction, periventricular expansion) compared to exer-
cise-heat stress without water replacement. Given the
potential dilution effect of replacing sweat loss with plain
water similar to other studies (Anastasiou et al. 2009), the
cerebrospinal fluid osmolality may decrease in parallel.
Hypotonic fluid perfusing the ventricular system will
increase
choroid
plexus
bulk
flow,
decreasing
cere-
brospinal fluid osmolality and expanding cortical gray
and white matter (DiMattio et al. 1975), consistent with
our finding. These results suggest replacing 100% of sweat
loss with electrolyte-free water may begin to induce brain
swelling, which is consistent directionally with the effects
of hyponatremia (Montain et al. 2001).
In contrast with our hypotheses, although both exer-
cise-heat stress with and without water replacement
altered brain structure volumes, no clear association with
visuomotor
performance
was
observed.
One
might
hypothesize that net tissue volume changes (in either
direction),

Exercise-Heat Stress Alters Visuomotor Performance

 shown in Figure 3), could explain performance impair-
ment since both cerebral edema (e.g., hyponatremia)
and dehydration symptoms include deteriorated mental
status (Adolph 1947; Hew-Butler et al. 2017). However,
this hypothesis is not supported by Figure 3E–F, as
some individuals with the largest thalamus expansions
and
contractions
demonstrated
sustained
visuomotor
accuracy. Thus, mechanisms unrelated to brain structural
changes are likely responsible for visuomotor impair-
ments following dehydration. An alternative hypothesis
underlying the impaired visuomotor performance might
be explained by an acute stress response (i.e., increased
catecholamine turnover) elicited by both exercise-heat
stress
and
body
water
deficits

Exercise-Heat Stress Alters Visuomotor Performance
 Cheuvront et al. 2004). Heat stress is known to impact
cognitive-motor performance, but impairments previ-
ously appeared limited to testing while in the hot envi-
ronment (Hancock et al. 2007) or with elevated core
temperatures (~39.5°C) (Gaoua 2010; Piil et al. 2017).
Dehydration
also
induces
an
acute
stress
response
(Popova et al. 2001), and therefore visuomotor perfor-
mance may, in part, have been impaired primarily via a
graded (and possibly additive) stress response elicited by
exercise-heat stress alone and exacerbated by body water
deficits. However, not all studies using exercise-heat
stress
(some
at
50°C)
have
found
cognitive-motor
impairments following dehydration (Ely et al. 2013), in
fact, with some reporting improved fine motor perfor-
mance (Bandelow et al. 2010). Future studies on brain
structure and function should consider including percep-
tual measures of task difficulty to discriminate between
physical and mental demands and alternative dehydra-
tion methods (e.g. fluid restriction, diuretics) to under-
stand the influence of heat stress per se.
Furthermore,
we
acknowledge
large
interindividual
variability in visuomotor performance (four subjects had
little change in accuracy across trials). Why some individ-
uals were more prone to the effects of prior exercise-heat
stress both with and without dehydration, while others
are resistant, is unclear. Vigilance for sustaining a simple
task may be attributed to attentional differences, although
no subjects were taking medication or diagnosed with
attentional deficit deficiencies. When searching for other
potential
variables
linked
to
the
heterogeneity
in
responses, no single factor (e.g., sex, month tested, final
core temperature, or RPE) appeared to explain the results.
Unfortunately, individual data is not consistently pre-
sented in previous studies; thus, it is unclear whether our
pattern of results is typical. Future work should attempt
to investigate the source of individual variability as it may
explain the overall lack of consistency in the literature.
Our exploratory brain activity analysis suggests dehy-
dration elevates neural activity during a simple visuomo-
tor task compared to resting control and exercise-heat

 stress with water replacement. The increase in BOLD fol-
lowing dehydration is similar to a prior study with mod-
est dehydration of 2% BM loss (Kempton et al. 2011a)
reporting elevated neural activity in fronto-parietal areas
although executive function was maintained. This is in
contrast
with
our
results
indicating
elevated
neural
resources devoted to the task were unable to sustain
visuomotor performance. Both studies assessed BOLD
responses on relatively modest sample sizes (n = 10) and
may be at risk for false positives and/or may be under-
powered to return differences (e.g., for EHS vs. CON in
this study). Elevated neural activity following dehydration
in this study occurred in task-specific areas (e.g., left tha-
lamus, left putamen, and left caudate) but also in more
ipsilateral areas (i.e., right thalamus/basal ganglia) sug-
gesting body water deficits elicit greater neural demands
during time keeping, planning and/or execution of finger
tapping (Cerasa et al. 2004; Horenstein et al. 2009). Sec-
ondly, the elevated neural activity within the hippocam-
pus, inferior, middle, and superior temporal lobes may
represent altered visual processing following dehydration.
The inferior temporal lobe integrates neural input from
the primary visual cortex to encode necessary object
information for motor-specific visual processing (i.e., ven-
tral visual stream) (Goodale and Milner 1992); the medial
temporal lobe may integrate information between the
ventral and dorsal processing streams (Tankus and Fried
2012). Alternatively, the elevated neural activity following
dehydration may suggest additive neural demands of
VMPT task completion and homeostasis maintenance, as
evidenced by elevated brain activations within the anterior
cingulate and superior temporal gyrus, brain areas known
to be involved with signaling thirst (Egan et al. 2003).
Furthermore, a right-lateralized network involving both
the anterior cingulate and thalamus mediates attentional
resources (Sturm and Willmes 2001), which, when com-
bined with the progressive decline in accuracy, could also
partially explain increased ipsilateral neural activity fol-
lowing dehydration. As a result, this exploratory analysis
suggests elevated brain activation following dehydration
elicited by exercise-heat stress may result from a conflu-
ence of sources.
In summary, our study is the first to analyze brain
structures and assess fundamental visuomotor functioning
(performance, brain function) at body water deficits that
require homeostatic responses (Cheuvront et al. 2010,
2013). This study made the following novel observations:
(1) visuomotor performance is impaired following exer-
cise-heat stress with water replacement and further exac-
erbated
by
dehydration;
(2)
several
brain
structure
volumes are sensitive to both increases and modest
decreases in plasma osmolality but these changes were
unrelated to visuomotor performance; (3) dehydration
may increase neural activity in task-specific and nontask
specific areas. These observations suggest dehydration
may elicit fundamental impairments in the visuomotor
system which could potentially impact military and occu-
pation-specific tasks requiring a prolonged motor output.
