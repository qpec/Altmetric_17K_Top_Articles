Abstract
The Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen that produces significant morbidity
and mortality. To explore the contribution of alveolar macrophages (AlvMΦs) in regulating
the severity of IAV infection we employed a murine model in which the Core Binding Factor
Beta gene is conditionally disrupted in myeloid cells. These mice exhibit a selective defi-
ciency in AlvMΦs. Following IAV infection these AlvMΦ deficient mice developed severe dif-
fuse alveolar damage, lethal respiratory compromise, and consequent lethality. Lethal injury
in these mice resulted from increased infection of their Type-1 Alveolar Epithelial Cells
(T1AECs) and the subsequent elimination of the infected T1AECs by the adaptive immune
T cell response. Further analysis indicated AlvMΦ-mediated suppression of the cysteinyl
leukotriene (cysLT) pathway genes in T1AECs in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of the cysLT
pathway enzymes in a T1AECs cell line reduced the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infec-
tion, suggesting that AlvMΦ-mediated suppression of this pathway contributes to the resis-
tance of T1AECs to IAV infection. Furthermore, inhibition of the cysLT pathway enzymes,
as well as blockade of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptors in the AlvMΦ deficient mice
reduced the susceptibility of their T1AECs to IAV infection and protected these mice from
lethal infection. These results suggest that AlvMΦs may utilize a previously unappreciated
mechanism to protect T1AECs against IAV infection, and thereby reduce the severity of
infection. The findings further suggest that the cysLT pathway and the receptors for cysLT
metabolites represent potential therapeutic targets in severe IAV infection.
Author Summary
A primary feature of lethal influenza infection is viral pneumonia. Influenza viral pneu-
monia is caused by the direct infection of alveolar epithelial cells, which subsequently
causes extensive alveolar inflammation and injury. Clinically this pathology manifests as
diffuse alveolar damage leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. As alveolar

 macrophages are positioned in the alveoli, they are the ideally localized to be a first-line of
defense against alveolar invading pathogens, such as influenza. To explore the contribu-
tion of alveolar macrophages to the development of lethal influenza pneumonia, we gener-
ated a novel mouse model with a selective deficiency in alveolar macrophages. As a result
of the alveolar macrophage deficiency, these mice developed severe diffuse alveolar dam-
age and lethal respiratory compromise after influenza infection. Lethal injury resulted
from increased infection of type-1 alveolar epithelial cells, and the elimination of these
infected cells by effector T cells. Further analysis indicated that in order to render type 1
cells resistant to influenza infection, alveolar macrophages suppress leukotrieneD4 pro-
duction and autocrine-signaling in type 1 cells. These results suggest that alveolar macro-
phages play a previously unappreciated role in protecting type 1 alveolar epithelial cells
against IAV infection, and thus the severity of infection.
Introduction
The Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen. In the United States alone, IAV
infections are associated with more than 20,000 deaths and 300,000 hospitalizations annually
[1]. IAV is a negative sense RNA virus that is transmitted by aerosol and fomites [2]. Upon
inhalation, IAV primarily infects and replicates in respiratory epithelial cells. After completion
of the replication cycle the newly formed virions are released apically from the infected cells
back into the pulmonary airspaces, allowing the virions to reach the more distal cells of the
respiratory tract as the infection evolves [3].
Eventually the infectious IAV virions reach the terminal airways, which are lined by type 1
and type 2 AECs (T1 and T2AEC). As T1AECs are responsible for gas exchange, extensive
infection and the subsequent elimination of these cells can lead to severe pulmonary compro-
mise [4,5]. In the murine model of IAV infection, one of the prominent differences between
infection with highly pathogenic IAV strains and strains producing limited morbidity and
mortality, is the degree to which T1AECs become infected and are subsequently eliminated
[6,7]. Furthermore, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), defined by the presence of fibrin deposi-
tion and alveolar hyaline membrane formation, as well as viral infection of alveolar epithelial
cells are frequently found in autopsies of severe clinical IAV infection [4,8]. Taken together,
these data strongly suggest that the degree of alveolar epithelium infection by IAV, and the
extent of the resulting injury, is one the many crucial regulators of the outcome of IAV
infection.
Recently, several reports have implicated the lung resident alveolar macrophages (AlvMFs)
as critical modulators of IAV disease severity and the development of lethal pulmonary injury
[9–12]. However, the mechanism(s) by which AlvMFs influence the outcome of IAV infection
has yet to be clearly determined, although an inability to clear cellular debris and exudates has
been implicated. AlvMFs are classically thought to be negative immune regulators and thereby
inhibit inflammatory responses to harmless inhaled antigens [13]. Conversely, their location
within the terminal airways also suggests that AlvMFs are one of the first innate immune cell
types to encounter any inhaled potentially harmful microbes. Therefore, AlvMFs are also
believed to be an important initiator of the inflammatory response during bacterial infections,
making them an important first line of defense against lower respiratory tract infection [14].
In the clinical setting, AlvMF dysfunction has been observed in multiple disease settings
including asthma, allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis,

 smoking related lung disease, and, in the complete absence of AlvMFs, the development of
pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [15–19].
While screening mice that had genes linked to myeloid lineage development knocked out
specifically in myeloid cells, we identified a mouse model in which there was a cellular defi-
ciency selectively in the AlvMF compartment. In this mouse model the expression of Core
Binding Factor Beta (CBFβ), which regulates the activity of the Runx family of transcription
factors essential for myelopoiesis, is selectively knocked out in myeloid cells expressing Lyso-
zyme M (LysM). This was accomplished by crossing CBFβ floxed mice with mice that express
Cre recombinase driven off of the LysM promoter (CBFβΔLysM) [20, 21]. As a consequence of
CBFβ gene disruption, these mice exhibit a deficiency in AlvMFs without detectable conse-
quences in the number or function of other LysM expressing cells in the lung and spleen,
thereby allowing us to better define and elucidate the mechanisms by which AlvMFs regulate
the outcome of influenza infection.
We report here that the AlvMF deficient CBFβΔLysM mice are highly susceptible to lethal
IAV infection. With the exception of their markedly reduced number of AlvMFs, CBFβΔLysM
mice exhibit no deficiency in innate or adaptive immune cells in the lungs prior to or following
IAV infection. The AlvMF deficiency did result in a marked increase in susceptibility of
T1AECs to IAV infection, resulting in the development of DAD and lethal injury following
infection. Indeed, a precipitous decline in respiratory function and development of lethal
injury in these AlvMF deficient mice was associated with the onset of the adaptive immune
response in the infected lungs, and immune mediated elimination of the infected T1AECs.
We further demonstrate that the AlvMF-conferred T1AEC resistance to IAV infection was
associated with the suppression of the genes for enzymes involved in the 5-lipoxygenase
(5-LOX) to cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) pathway in T1AECs from infected lungs. Consistent
with a role for AlvMFs in regulating the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection through
control of the cysLT pathway, blockade/knockdown of cysLT pathway enzymes in T1AECs in
vitro or antagonism of the cysLT pathway and the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 in vivo
reduced the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection and rendered the AlvMF deficient
CBFβΔLysM mice resistant to lethal IAV infection.
Results
Characterization of the Conditional CBFβ Deficient Mice
To assess the impact of disruption of the CBFβ gene in the myeloid lineage we examined the
outcome of intranasal (i.n.) infection of CBFβΔLysM mice and wild type (WT) control CBFβfl/fl
littermates with a sublethal dose (0.1LD50) of the mouse adapted Influenza A strain A/PR/8
[H1N1]. As expected, infected WT mice survived and recovered from this inoculum dose (Fig
1a). However, CBFβΔLysM mice exhibited markedly reduced survival (> 85% mortality) follow-
ing infection (Fig 1a) suggesting that expression of CBFβ in one or more cell types of the mye-
loid lineage was critical for recovery from IAV infection.
Since several cell types of myeloid origin are affected by LysM driven Cre-mediated inacti-
vation of the CBFβ gene, we employed the ROSA26 reporter mouse system, which allowed us
to identify the cell type(s) responsive to LysM-Cre by Cre driven YFP expression. As Table 1
indicates, both before and after infection, efficient recombination (YFP expression) was pri-
marily restricted to neutrophils and AlvMFs, each of which displayed greater than 80%
LysM-Cre driven recombination. By contrast, inflammatory mononuclear cells and respira-
tory dendritic cells were only modestly YFP+ (~ 20% or less) (Table 1) (Gating strategy S1 Fig).
The above reporter mouse analysis suggested that inactivation of the CBFβ gene by
LysM-Cre would primarily affect the neutrophil and/or AlvMFs lineages. However, published

 findings indicate that the RUNX TFs are essential early during neutrophil development, but
are down regulated just as LysM expression is upregulated [22]. Therefore, we did not expect
pulmonary neutrophil accumulation and function to be significantly impacted by the CBFβ
deletion. By contrast, examination of the CD45+ cells in the bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL)
fluid and lungs of naïve mice revealed markedly diminished numbers of AlvMFs (CD45+,
CD11c+, Siglec F+ cells) in the CBFβΔLysM mice compared to their WT littermate controls
(70%-80% reduction in the BAL and 50%-75% in the lung) (Fig 1b). In contrast to WT
AlvMFs, which are classically defined as CD11b-, the majority of the small number of AlvMFs
in the CBFβΔLysM BAL fluid and lungs were CD11b+, however they still maintained typical
macrophage morphology (Fig 1b and S2a Fig). Immature AlvMFs are initially CD11b+, but
down regulate CD11b as they mature/differentiate. Therefore, since CBFβ expression supports
myeloid lineage development, the small number of CD11b+ AlvMFs could represent cells at
an early/intermediary stage in AlvMF development/ differentiation [23, 24]. Of note, the
residual AlvMFs in naive CBFβΔLysM mice were sufficient to prevent the development of alveo-
lar proteinosis as determined by BAL protein concentration and lung histology/morphology
(Fig 1c and S2b Fig). After IAV infection there was a transient decrease in the number of
AlvMFs in the BAL of WT mice that began to recover by day 7 PI and progressively increased
out to day 11 PI. In contrast, the AlvMF deficit in the CBFβΔLysM mice became even more pro-
nounced over time with few AlvMFs (CD11b- or CD11b+) detectable at day 7 PI and beyond
(Fig 1d).
As expected, we observed no difference between WT and CBFβΔLysM mice in their lung and
BAL accumulation of neutrophils (CD45+, Siglec F-, CD11b+, Ly6G+ cells) before and during
IAV infection (Fig 1e and S2d Fig). We also detected no difference in cell surface expression of
CD107a (a marker of degranulation) or in the magnitude of CD11b expression (which is ele-
vated on activated neutrophils) on pulmonary neutrophils following IAV infection in WT and
CBFβΔLysM mice (Fig 1f) [25]. In summary, these data suggest that, as expected, neutrophil
infiltration and function during IAV infection is unaffected in CBFβΔLysM mice.
There was also no deficit in the total number of pulmonary interstitial macrophages
(CD45+, Siglec F-, CD11b+, F4/80+ cells) (Fig 1g) or respiratory dendritic cells (CD45+,
CD11c+, MHCII+, Siglec F-, B220- cells, either CD103+ or CD11b+) (Fig 1h) in WT and

 CBFβΔLysM mice. LysM driven Cre recombination activity was also detected in a minor frac-
tion of cells making up the heterogeneous population of inflammatory mononuclear cells
(IMNCs) (Table 1). The absolute number of IMNCs (CD45+, CD11b+, Siglec F-, Ly6G- cells)
(Fig 1i and S2e Fig) and the frequency of IMNCs that express Ly6C (Fig 1j) before or during
IAV infection were likewise unaffected in CBFβΔLysM mice. As there was no difference in
IMNC infiltration between wild type and CBFβΔLysM mice, CCR2 expression by the mononu-
clear cells was not further evaluated. Interestingly, we also saw no difference in splenic macro-
phages, neutrophils, IMNCs and DCs in CBFβΔLysM and WT mice (S2c Fig). These data
suggest that the disruption of CBFβ in the CBFβΔLysM mice had only a minimal, if any, effect
on the development and effector response of these pulmonary mononuclear cell subsets and
the innate immune response to IAV infection.
Characterization of Virus Clearance and the Adaptive Immune
Response in IAV Infected CBFβΔLysM Mice
In previous reports acute depletion of AlvMFs prior to IAV infection was shown to result in
enhanced virus titers and impaired adaptive T cell responses [9, 11, 12]. In order to determine
if the loss of AlvMFs in the CBFβΔLysM mice resulted in uncontrolled virus replication, or had
any impact on the IAV adaptive response, we next evaluated virus replication/clearance and
the adaptive response in WT and CBFβΔLysM mice. The CBFβΔLysM mice succumbed to infec-
tion between days 8 and 15 PI (Fig 1a), which are following the characteristic onset of the
adaptive immune response and concomitant virus clearance as observed in WT mice [26]. The
tempo of IAV replication and clearance in the lungs was comparable for WT and CBFβΔLysM
mice as determined by BAL fluid virus titers (Fig 2a). It is noteworthy that infectious virus was
no longer detectable by day 11 PI, when infected CBFβΔLysM mice succumbed to infection.
Infectious virus clearance was also confirmed by the analysis of viral gene expression in whole
lung homogenates of WT and CBFβΔLysM mice (Fig 2b), which was comparable, except for a
statistically non-significant trend toward a slight delay in clearance of the spliced IAV M2 gene
mRNA in CBFβΔLysM mice (Fig 2b) [26].
The above findings indicate that virus clearance was normal in the CBFβΔLysM mice, sug-
gesting that the adaptive immune response to IAV was not affected. Indeed, following infec-
tion, BAL IAV-specific IgG antibodies (Fig 2c), total CD4 T cells (Fig 2d) and IAV-specific
CD8 T cells (Fig 2e) in the CBFβΔLysM mice were comparable to WT mice. Furthermore, kinet-
ics of effector T cell derived cytokines IFNγ, IL-10, and TNF were similar between CBFβΔLysM
mice and their WT littermates (Fig 2f). Consistent with previously published observations we
were unable to detect Th2 or Th17 T cell responses (Fig 2g) in the lungs of CBFβΔLysM or WT
mice. A multiplex analysis of 30 cytokines and chemokines (listed in the Methods section) in
the BAL fluid at days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 11 PI also gave comparable values for WT and CBFβΔLysM
mice, except for a modest elevation in CCL2 (days 7 and 11 PI) and CXCL9 (day 11 PI) in
infected CBFβΔLysM mice. Cumulatively, these data indicate that the AlvMF deficiency has no
demonstrable effect on the establishment of the anti-IAV adaptive immune responses and
IAV clearance, or on the function and properties of the innate immune cells involved in the
induction of adaptive immune responses, particularly rDCs.
IAV Infection in AlvMΦ Deficient Mice Results in Severe Respiratory
Insufficiency and Marked Diffuse Alveolar Damage
The above results indicated that the quality and magnitude of the innate and adaptive host
response, as well as the efficiency of virus clearance, in the IAV infected lungs were comparable
between WT and CBFβΔLysM mice. We did however observe a significant increase in

 erythrocyte extravasation into the airways/BAL fluid of CBFβΔLysM mice when analyzed at day
7 and 11 PI. In order to directly quantify the extent of vascular leak in the infected lungs, we
examined the accumulation of Evans Blue dye in the airways of WT and CBFβΔLysM mice one
hour after intravenous administration. While vascular leak was comparable in WT and
CBFβΔLysM mice on day 4 PI, by day 7 PI CBFβΔLysM mice had markedly elevated Evans Blue
dye accumulation in their airways (Fig 3a). These findings raised the possibility that there was
substantial pulmonary capillary leak in the IAV infected CBFβΔLysM mice, suggesting extensive
alveolar damage was occurring at the time of onset of the adaptive immune response.
To assess whether the elevated vascular leak in the lungs of infected CBFβΔLysM mice had
any consequences on lung structure, we compared histopathologic changes in the lungs of
infected WT and CBFβΔLysM mice (Fig 3b). At day 12 PI both WT and CBFβΔLysM mice dis-
played extensive interstitial inflammation and edema characteristic of severe IAV infection.
However, the CBFβΔLysM mice additionally had extensive intra-alveolar fibrin deposition, hya-
line membrane formation and loss of alveolar wall integrity, reflecting histologic features char-
acteristics of diffuse alveolar damage (Fig 3b). These findings suggest that the AlvMF
deficiency in CBFβΔLysM mice is linked to the development of enhanced alveolar injury follow-
ing IAV infection.
A hallmark of enhanced alveolar injury with diffuse alveolar damage during severe IAV
infection is compromised respiratory function, most notably diminished O2 exchange result-
ing in hypoxemia. When we analyzed blood O2 saturation in WT and CBFβΔLysM mice follow-
ing IAV infection, we observed that out to day 5 PI, O2 saturation was comparable in both WT
and CBFβΔLysM mice (Fig 3c). However at day 6 PI, corresponding with the onset of the IAV
specific adaptive immune response in the lungs, there was a precipitous drop in O2 saturation
in the CBFβΔLysM mice, which resulted in progressive severe hypoxemia on subsequent days
analyzed (Fig 3c).
It is noteworthy that there was only a modest initial decline in blood O2 saturation at day
4–5 PI in both WT and CBFβΔLysM mice in spite of extensive IAV replication in the infected
lungs at these early times (Fig 2a and 2b). The precipitous decline in O2 saturation coinciding
with the onset of adaptive immune response raised the possibility that adaptive immune-medi-
ate clearance of IAV infected epithelial cells was responsible for the rapid decline in O2 satura-
tion CBFβΔLysM mice. Indeed, the simultaneous depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at day 3
PI, thereby inhibiting the subsequent infiltration of these cells into the lungs, prevented the
decline in O2 saturation at day 7 PI in CBFβΔLysM mice (Fig 3d). By contrast, depletion of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in infected WT mice had only a modest effect on O2 saturation (Fig
3d). Consistent with a role for the adaptive immune T cell response to IAV in the development
of respiratory compromise, infected untreated adaptive immune deficient RAG KO mice also
displayed only a modest decline in blood O2 saturation out to day 7 PI (Fig 3d).
AlvMΦs Regulate the Susceptibility of Type 1 Alveolar Epithelial Cells to
IAV Infection
The accumulated evidence demonstrating alveolar pulmonary vascular leak, histologic changes
reflecting severe alveolar damage, and compromised pulmonary function (Fig 3a–3d) sug-
gested that AECs were the likely target of the effector T cells in the CBFβΔLysM mice. In order to

 determine if the T cell mediated alveolar injury in CBFβΔLysM mice was related to the extent of
AEC infection, we infected WT and CBFβΔLysM mice with the reporter A/PR/8–NS1-GFP
strain, which allows for the identification of infected cells by GFP expression [27]. Pulmonary
epithelial cells were identified as CD45-, CD31- and EpCAM+. Following published protocols,
T1AECs were distinguished by podoplanin/T1α expression [28–31] and T2AECs were identi-
fied by cell surface MHCII expression, which we confirmed co-localized with intracellular pro-
Surfactant Protein C staining in T2AECs from naïve lungs [31–35] (S3a and S3b Fig). CD45-,
CD31- and EpCAM+ cells that were negative for AEC lineage markers T1α or MHCII were
grouped as bronchial/bronchiolar epithelial cells (referred to here as conducting airway epithe-
lial cells) [35] (S3a and S3b Fig). (However, it should be noted that because of modest MHCII
expression, the ratio of conducting airway cells to T2AECs might not be fully representative.)
As Fig 3e demonstrates, the frequency of IAV infected T1AECs from CBFβΔLysM mice was sig-
nificantly elevated compared to the AlvMF sufficient WT mice at both day 4 & 7 PI. Impor-
tantly, while the frequency of infected T1AECs from the CBFβΔLysM mice remained high at day
7 PI, the total number of infected T1AECs did decrease from day 4 to day 7 PI (Fig 3e), consis-
tent with T cell mediated elimination of these virally infected cells at the latter time point.
In contrast, the susceptibility of the conducting airway cells and T2AECs from CBFβΔLysM
mice to IAV infection was increased at day 4 PI, but returned to WT levels by day 7 PI, before
the death of the CBFβΔLysM mice (Fig 3f and S3c Fig). Again, the total number of infected pul-
monary epithelial cells decreased with the onset of the adaptive immune response in both
AlvMF deficient CBFβΔLysM mice and AlvMF sufficient WT mice. Given the three-fold
increase in infection of T1AECs in CBFβΔLysM mice, the two-fold increase in T2AEC infection
by IAV was not unexpected (Fig 3e and S3c Fig). However, while both conducting and T2AEC
infection rates returned to WT levels by day 7PI, the rate of T1AEC infection selectively
remained high throughout infection in the AlvMF-deficient CBFβΔLysM mice (Fig 3e and 3f
and S3c Fig).
To determine if restoring AlvMFs to CBFβΔLysM mice would likewise restore resistance of
T1AECs to IAV infection we employed two strategies. Firstly, we adoptively transferred 5x105
WT AlvMFs into CBFβΔLysM mice by the i.n. route, one day prior to IAV infection. Transfer
of AlvMFs into CBFβΔLysM mice rescued the resistance of their T1AECs to IAV infection, but
had no impact on the susceptibility of T1AECs from WT mice (Fig 3g left panel). Importantly,
this transfer of AlvMFs into CBFβΔLysM mice, which conferred resistance of T1AECs to infec-
tion, also rescued CBFβΔLysM mice resistance to lethality after IAV infection (Fig 3g right
panels).
Secondly, we constructed mixed bone marrow chimeric mice in which irradiated WT
(CD45.2+) mice were reconstituted with either CD45.1+ WT bone marrow, CD45.2+
CBFβΔLysM bone marrow, or a mixture of 90% CBFβΔLysM and 10% WT bone marrow (Mix).
Since the CBFβΔLysM donor bone marrow would not be able to fully regenerate AlvMFs in the
irradiated recipients, a 10% WT bone marrow supplement was employed in the 90:10 mixed
chimeras to selectively reconstitute the AlvMF compartment with WT cells, while all other

 Seven weeks after reconstitution, AlvMFs in irradiated WT bone marrow reconstituted
recipients were exclusively of donor bone marrow origin (S3d Fig). In the 90:10 mixed bone
marrow recipients, the AlvMFs were the only myeloid cells in the lungs that were derived
from WT bone marrow at a frequency greater than 10% (Fig 3h), reflecting a partial restora-
tion of AlvMF numbers (Fig 3i). Following IAV infection, the T1AECs from the mixed bone
marrow chimeric mice with the partial AlvMFs rescue demonstrated an enhanced resistance
to IAV infection, which was comparable to the control irradiated WT bone marrow chimeras
(Fig 3j).
Lastly, since neutrophils, like AlvMFs, strongly express LysM (Table 1) we evaluated the
impact of acute neutrophil depletion (by administration of the neutrophil depleting antibody
IA8) on the susceptibility of T1AECs to infection. We observed no effect of neutrophil deple-
tion on T1AEC susceptibility to IAV infection (S3e Fig). In sum these data further support the
concept that CBFβΔLysM mice have a selective quantitative deficiency in AlvMFs, and that this
deficit in AlvMFs results in enhanced susceptibility of T1AECs cells to IAV infection.
AlvMΦs Act Early in IAV Infection to Regulate the Susceptibility of
T1AECs
Since, even in WT mice, AlvMF numbers are diminished by day 4 PI, (Fig 1d), we sought to
determine when AlvMFs conferred resistance of T1AECs to IAV infection. To do so, we
employed a mouse model in which the diphtheria toxin (DTx) receptor is expressed under
control of the CD11c promoter (CD11c-DTxR), allowing for the depletion of CD11c+ cells,
including AlvMFs, following DTx administration. DTx was administered prior to or up to
48hours following IAV infection. The susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection was evaluated
at day 4 PI, prior to the onset of the adaptive immune response in the lungs, and therefore,
before the impact of DTx administration on the elimination of rDCs would manifest. Similar
to T1AEC from CBFβΔLysM mice, T1AECs from CD11c-DTxR mice displayed enhanced sus-
ceptibility to IAV infection at day 4 PI when diphtheria toxin was administered i.n. on day -1
or day 1 PI (Fig 4a). On the other hand, when AlvMFs were eliminated at day 2 PI, T1AEC
susceptibility to IAV infection was comparable to T1AECs from DTx treated WT control mice
(Fig 4a). These findings suggested that AlvMFs function between days 1 and 2 PI to confer

 resistance of T1AECs to IAV infection. This is a time when there is minimal recruitment of
other CD45+ cell types into the parenchyma or airways, and therefore, when AlvMFs are the
predominant CD45+ cell type in the airways.
To directly determine whether AlvMFs were exposed to IAV at the time they were confer-
ring resistance of T1AECs to infection, we evaluated the kinetics of AlvMF infection. As Fig
4b demonstrates, while viral genes were not detected in AlvMFs isolated from the BAL prior
to or on day 1 PI, cell surface HA and intracellular NP proteins were readily detectable by day
2 PI. This finding suggested that the regulation of T1AEC susceptibility by AlvMFs was associ-
ated with AlvMF exposure to IAV.
AlvMΦs Confer Resistance to IAV Infection by Regulating Expression of
a Leukotriene Pathway in T1AEC
Type I and III Interferons (IFNs) are important mediators of resistance to IAV infection and
AlvMFs have been implicated as one source of IFNs during infection [36]. Both Type I and
Type III IFNs were detected at comparable levels in the BAL fluid of the AlvMF deficient
CBFβΔLysM and WT mice days 0–2 PI (Fig 5a). This is during the time frame in which AlvMFs
were demonstrated to confer resistance of T1AEC to IAV infection. Furthermore, there was
no difference in the expression of representative IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) in whole lungs
or sorted T1AECs isolated from CBFβΔLysM and WT mice at day 2 PI (Fig 5b and 5c). Taken
together, these findings suggested that, while IFNs are essential in controlling IAV infection,
AlvMFs were not utilizing IFNs to protect T1AEC from IAV infection.
To gain insight as to why T1AECs in the presence of AlvMFs were more resistant to IAV
infection, we carried out transcriptomic profiling (RNAseq) on T1AECs isolated from the
lungs of the AlvMF deficient CBFβΔLysM mice and AlvMF sufficient WT mice at day 2 PI,
after AlvMF mediated resistance to infection had been conferred (Fig 4a).
RNAseq revealed that no genes were preferentially down regulated in the day 2 T1AECs
from CBFβΔLysM mice, but a number of genes were preferentially upregulated. Pathway analy-
sis on the genes over expressed in the CBFβΔLysM T1AECs using the NIH DAVID database
revealed that nine of the genes were enzymes/co-factors involved in the arachidonic acid
metabolism pathway (Fig 5d) [37, 38]. Four of the genes encode molecules involved in the
cytochrome P450 (CYP4F18, CYP4F16), Thromboxane (Tbxas1) and 15-lipoxygenase
(ALOX15) pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism (Fig 5e). The other five genes (ALOX5,
ALOX5ap, Cotl1, GGT1 and DPEP2) encode enzymes or co-factors involved in the 5-lipoxy-
genase (5-LOX) cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) pathway that generates the cysLT metabolites:
leukotriene C4 (LTC4), leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and leukotriene E4 (LTE4) (Fig 5e). Of note,
the gene encoding the sixth enzyme in this pathway, leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), also
trended at greater than a two-fold enhancement in expression in the CBFβΔLysM T1AECs, but
lacked statistical significance.
Due to the current lack of mouse models that would allow us to selectively probe T1AECs
in vivo, as well as the inability to sustain T1AECs in culture ex vivo, we utilized the recently cre-
ated and characterized T1AEC cell line of C57Bl/6 origin, LET1 cells, to explore any link
between AlvMF mediated resistance of T1AECs to IAV and the expression of these arachi-
donic acid pathway enzymes in T1AECs [28]. We first confirmed publish results that podopla-
nin positive LET1 cells can be infected with A/PR/8 NS1-GFP IAV as determined by GFP
expression (Fig 5f) [28]. Consistent with our in vivo findings, primary AlvMFs co-cultured
directly with LET1 cells (or separated by a membrane barrier in transwell cultures) signifi-
cantly reduced the infection of LET1 cells by IAV (Fig 5f). Co-culture of LET1 cells with
splenic CD11c+ cells resulted in only a minimal increase in resistance of LET1 cells to

 infection, suggesting that the effect of the AlvMFs on the LET1 cells was not due to a simple
change in the MOI of the T1AECs in culture. We next utilized the LET1 and AlvMF co-cul-
ture system to determine if AlvMF mediated resistance to IAV was linked to the transcrip-
tional inhibition of these arachidonic acid pathway enzymes in T1AECs. As Fig 5g
demonstrates, consistent with our findings in vivo, the expression of genes encoding the ara-
chidonic acid metabolism enzymes were reduced in infected LET1 cells co-cultured with
AlvMFs.
To determine if the activity of one or more of these arachidonic acid metabolism enzymes
facilitates IAV infection of T1AECs, we examined the impact of small molecule inhibitors tar-
geting these enzymes on the susceptibility of LET1 cells to IAV infection. Inhibition of throm-
boxane synthase enzymatic activity in LET1 cells with the inhibitor Ozagrel had minimal or no

 impact on IAV infection of the LET1 cells (Fig 6a). On the other hand, inhibition of enzymes
along the cytochrome P450 F and A family pathway (by the small molecule inhibitor
HET0016) resulted in a modest, statistically significant impact on IAV infection of LET1 cells
(Fig 6a). Furthermore, inhibition of the activity of the 5-LOX pathway enzyme ALOX5 by
Zileuton also produced a similar significant reduction in LET1 cell susceptibility to IAV infec-
tion (Fig 6a). We next examined the impact of inhibition of the activity the two enzymes
downstream of ALOX5 in the cysLT pathway that were likewise upregulated in T1AECs from
the AlvMF deficient mice. Inhibition of the activity of gamma glutamyl transferase-1 (GGT1)
(which converts the metabolite LTC4 to LTD4) in LET1 cells alone with the drug Acivicin
markedly reduced the susceptibility of LET1 cells to IAV infection. Conversely, inhibition of
the enzyme DPEP2 (which converts LTD4 to the less biologically active metabolite LTE4) with
the inhibitor Cilastatin had no effect on T1AEC susceptibility to infection (Fig 6a), suggesting
that LTD4, but not LTE4, may regulated the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection.
AlvMFs, which render T1AECs resistant to IAV infection in vivo and in vitro, also reduced
GGT1 expression in vivo and in vitro (Fig 5b and 5c). Inhibition of GGT1 enzymatic activity in
T1AECs by Acivicin, likewise, decreased T1AEC susceptibility to IAV infection. Because Aci-
vicin is not a selective GGT1 inhibitor, we next determined if knockdown of GGT1 expression
in LET1 cells would also reduce their susceptibility to infection. As Fig 6b shows, compared to
cells expressing control-scrambled shRNA, partial knockdown of GGT1 expression by GGT1
shRNA lentivirus treatment (Fig 6b left panel) also reduced the susceptibility of shRNA treated
LET1 cells to IAV infection (Fig 6b right panel).
Although the interaction of AlvMFs with LET1 cells in vitro recapitulated the effect of
AlvMFs on the susceptibility of T1AECs in vivo, this in vitro interaction likely does not
reflect the full impact of AlvMFs on T1AECs during IAV infection in vivo. Therefore, in
order to determine if LTD4 production impacted the susceptibility of T1AECs in vivo, we
evaluated the effect of Acivicin administration to WT and CBFβΔLysM mice on the suscepti-
bility of T1AEC. Acivicin was administration at 5 and 29 hours PI i.n. to inhibit early LTD4
production. These time points are prior to the large influx of CD45+ inflammatory immune
cells into the lung, which can also be a significant source of cysLT metabolites [26]. In vivo
Acivicin treatment markedly reduced the susceptibility of T1AEC from CBFβΔLysM mice to
IAV infection. Of note, Acivicin had only a minimal effect on the susceptibility of T1AECs
from the AlvMF sufficient WT mice (Fig 6c). This latter finding suggests that the ability of
Acivicin to reduce the susceptibility of T1AECs to infection is not due to nonspecific sup-
pression of IAV infection.
The above evidence supported a link between the activity of the 5-LOX/cysLT metabolic
pathway in T1AEC and their susceptibility to IAV infection. This is of interest as elevated lev-
els of LTE4, the stable terminal metabolite of the cysLT pathway, has been reported to correlate
with increased severity of IAV infection in both humans and mice [39]. LTD4 signals by
engaging the cell surface Cysteinyl LT receptors (CysLT1 and/or CysLT2). The aforemen-
tioned RNAseq analysis revealed that at day 2 PI T1AECs express CysLT1 with twenty-two-
fold higher FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase Mapped) than CysLT2 (Fig 6d). This is of particu-
lar interest as CysLT1 has higher affinity for LTD4 than CysLT2.
In order to explore the possibility that LTD4 engagement of CysLT1 on T1AECs was
responsible for the enhanced susceptibility of T1AECs in the AlvMF deficient CBFβΔLysM
mice, we administered the CysLT1 antagonist Zafirlukast to these mice. As Fig 6e demon-
strates, like Acivicin, i.p. administration of Zafirlukast on days 0–3 PI, markedly reduced
T1AEC susceptibility to IAV infection in CBFβΔLysM mice. Consistent with this data, Zafirlu-
kast administration also rendered the treated CBFβΔLysM mice resistant to lethal IAV infection
(Fig 6f). These data are consistent with the concept that AlvMFs act, at least in part, to

 suppress the susceptibility of T1AECs to infection by inhibiting cysLT pathway, possibly in
T1AECs, which in-turn suppresses LTD4 signaling through CysLT1 on T1AEC.
The above findings suggest that engagement of CysLT1 on T1AECs enhances the suscepti-
bility of these cells to infection by IAV. It has previously been reported that the initial enzyme
in the Arachidonic Acid Metabolic Pathway, Phospholipase D, may facilitate IAV uptake [40].
Furthermore, key signaling molecules activated downstream of LTD4’s engagement of CysLT1
(ROCK1 and RAC) have been demonstrated to facilitate endocytic uptake of IAV [41, 42].
Therefore, we next sought to determine if AlvMFs, which inhibit the arachidonic acid

 metabolism and cysLT pathway, also modulate endocytosis in T1AEC by evaluating receptor-
dependent endocytic uptake of transferrin. As Fig 6g demonstrates, IAV-infected AlvMFs, but
not naïve AlvMFs, decreased LET1 cell receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis of
transferrin that was labeled with the pH-sensitive dye pHrodo Red. Similarly, inhibition of
GGT1 activity with Acivicin also decreased LET1 cell endocytic uptake of pHrodo Red labeled
transferrin (Fig 6g). These findings are consistent with our data demonstrating AlvMF-medi-
ated suppression of the cysLT pathway and protection of T1AECs from IAV infection in vitro
and in vivo.
Discussion
In this report we have evaluated the contribution of AlvMFs to the host response in experi-
mental IAV infection. We observed that mice with a genetic deficiency selectively in AlvMFs
(CBFβΔLysM mice) are highly susceptible to IAV infection. This deficiency in AlvMFs resulted
in increased susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection that could be rescued by transferring
WT AlvMFs into the CBFβΔLysM mice, suggesting that AlvMFs are important mediators of
T1AEC resistance to IAV infection. Along with increased numbers of infected T1AEC, the
IAV infected AlvMF deficient mice also exhibit severely compromised pulmonary function
and morphologic evidence of diffuse alveolar damage, which are compatible with severe lethal
IAV pneumonia. While Type I and Type III IFNs are essential for respiratory epithelial cell
resistance to IAV infection (including T1AEC), AlvMF-mediated protection of T1AECs was
IFN-independent. Rather, our data strongly implicates that AlvMF-mediated transcriptional
suppression of the cysLT pathway enzymes in T1AECs is one possible mechanism that medi-
ates T1AEC resistance to IAV infection. Consistent with this resistance mechanism, inhibition
of the cysLT pathway enzymes, in particular GGT1 reduced the susceptibility of T1AECs in
CBFβΔLysM mice to infection, as did antagonism of the cysLT receptor CysLT1.
Earlier reports evaluating the host response to IAV infection demonstrated a critical role
for AlvMFs in modulating the severity and outcome of IAV infection [9–13, 19]. While
AlvMF phagocytosis of IAV particles, cellular debris and clearance of edema fluid undoubt-
edly contributes to AlvMF-mediated protection during IAV infection, a direct link between
AlvMF function and the development of lethal pneumonia was not established in these
reports. While it is currently not possible to directly assay cysLT metabolite production exclu-
sively by T1AEC in vivo or ex vivo, to probe T1AEC CysLT receptor activity in vivo or ex vivo,
or to disrupt this arachidonic acid metabolic pathway specifically in T1AECs in vivo, our
results strongly suggest that there is a link between AlvMF-mediated resistance of T1AECs to
IAV infection and AlvMF-mediated suppression of the expression of genes evolved in the
cysLT pathway in T1AECs. This was evident both in vivo, where T1AEC from infected AlvMF
deficient mice exhibited elevated expression of genes encoding cysLT pathway enzymes, as
well as in vitro, where co-culture of T1AEC with AlvMFs during IAV infection reduced both
the expression of cysLT pathway genes and IAV infection. Additional support for a role of the
cysLT pathway enzymes in regulating the efficiency of T1AEC IAV infection came from the
effect of inhibiting 5-LOX (by the inhibitor Zileuton) and GGT1 (by the inhibitor Acivicin)
specifically in LET1 cells. Even more compelling was the finding that treatment of infected
CBFβΔLysM mice and WT mice with Acivicin within the first two-days post infection signifi-
cantly reduced the frequency of infected T1AEC in the AlvMF deficient CBFβΔLysM mice, but
had minimal effect on infection of T1AEC from infected WT mice. While our findings most
likely reflect the impact of a quantitative deficiency in the number of AlvMFs in the lungs of
the CBFβΔLysM mice, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that there is a subtle change in
the function of the few residual AlvMFs detected in the lungs. Likewise, we also cannot

 formally exclude that alterations in the function of other LysM expressing cell types lacking
CBFβ could also affect the susceptibility of T1AECs to infection, and therefore the outcome of
infection in the CBFβΔLysM mice. However, findings on the effect of AlvMF transfer into
CBFβΔLysM mice, as well as the effect of acute depletion of AlvMF in the CD11c-DTR model,
strongly implicate AlvMFs as having a primary role and mediating resistance of T1AECs to
infection.
The timing of AlvMF-mediated protection, along with the timing of cysLT gene activation
and the brief, early timeframe in which Acivicin treatment worked have two important impli-
cations. First is that in vivo T1AECs are protected at a time point when AlvMFs would be the
predominant, if not exclusive, cell type in the alveoli to detect the infection and confer resis-
tance to T1AEC. Therefore, it is formally possible that AlvMFs are not the only CD45+ cell
type capable of providing protection to T1AECs, and that it is their proximity to the AECs at
this early time point that allows them to confer protection. Second, many of the CD45+ cell
types that have been classically established as the cysLT producers have yet to substantially
accumulate in the lungs or reach the airways by day 2 PI, which, once again, is when our data,
particularly on Acivicin administration, strongly suggests that the cysLT metabolites are acting
on the T1AECs to enhance their susceptibility to IAV infection. The finding that T1AECs may
produce cysLTs is further supported by a growing body of literature demonstrating that, while
initially in vitro data indicated that only myeloid cells express 5-LOX and therefore produce
cysLTs [43], in vivo non-hematopoietic cell types as diverse as neurons, epithelial cells and
endothelial cells are capable of expressing 5-LOX and producing cysLTs [44–50].
Methylation of the ALOX5 gene promoter has been reported in cell lines where the cysLT
pathway is inactive. Therefore, methylation of ALOX5 has been suggested as the mechanism
of gene silencing that accounts for the lack of 5-LOX expression and cysLT production by
these cell types [48–50]. Since AlvMFs prevent the upregulation of the cysLT pathway genes in
T1AECs, AlvMFs may confer resistance of T1AECs to infection by maintaining the ALOX5
promoter in a methylated state. As far as we are aware, there is minimal information concern-
ing mechanisms to account for suppression, particularly transcriptional suppression of the
cysLT pathway beyond methylation of the ALOX5 gene. We therefore attempted to identify
the suppressive factor by screen the BAL fluid for inflammatory mediators that maybe differ-
entially represented in the CBFβΔLysM mice at day 2 PI when the 5-LOX and the cysLT pathway
is suppressed by AlvMFs. However, as noted above (Results), a 30-plex-cytokine/chemokine
survey revealed no detectable differences in the inflammatory mediators present in the BAL at
days 0 and 2 PI.
Activation of the cysLT pathway results in the synthesis of the cysLT metabolites LTC4,
LTD4 and LTE4. A role for LTD4 engagement of CysLT1 on T1AECs was supported by the
evidence that blockade of CysLT1 through Zafirlukast administration markedly reduced
T1AEC susceptibility to IAV infection and prevented IAV associated mortality in CBFβΔLysM
mice. These findings raise the possibility that T1AEC production of the CysLT metabolite
LTD4 may support cellular uptake or replication of IAV in T1AEC by signaling through cysLT
receptors displayed by T1AEC.
Engagement of CysLT1, a G-protein coupled receptor, by LTD4 results in the mobilization
of intracellular calcium. IAV has been reported to utilize calcium dependent activation of the
ROCK-1 and RAC-1 signaling pathways in cells to facilitate IAV virion uptake and internaliza-
tion [41, 42]. Constant with this work, we found that IAV-infected AlvMFs were able to sup-
press LET1 cell endocytic uptake of transferrin. Signaling through CysLT receptors can also
result in calcium-dependent activation of PI-3 kinase and CAM kinase in cells, which in turn
enhances IAV gene expression in cells infected with certain IAV strains [41]. Thus the
enhanced susceptibility of T1AEC to IAV infection in the absence of AlvMFs may reflect both

 increased efficiency of virus uptake and the extent of virus replication as a result of CysLT1
engagement.
While we observed an increase in the frequency and absolute number of infected T1AEC in
CBFβΔLysM mice, overall lung virus titers in these animals only trended towards a slight
enhancement and were only modestly elevated compared to lung virus titers in WT mice. This
was in contrast to earlier reports in other mouse models [12] where an AlvMF deficiency
resulted in elevated pulmonary virus titers. This discrepancy is perhaps not unexpected as the
deficiency in AlvMFs numbers is quantitative in our model, and T1AECs, while capable of
productive IAV infection, are not as efficient in virion production as conducting airway epi-
thelial cells [28]. Therefore, the 3-fold increase in infected T1AECs in the AlvMF deficient
mice may not significantly impact the level of detectable virions in the infected lungs. We also
demonstrate that the enhanced mortality of CBFβΔLysM mice after IAV infection is likely not a
direct result of virus mediated destruction of the increased number of IAV infected cells.
Rather, our results suggest that the increased number of infected T1AEC rendered these cells
more susceptible to adaptive-mediated elimination, and as a consequence, the development of
lethal diffuse alveolar damage.
In conclusion, we have identified a novel role for AlvMFs in modulating the severity of
IAV infection by regulating the expression of the cysLT pathway in T1AECs and, as a conse-
quence, the susceptibility of T1AECs to IAV infection. In addition to the mechanism proposed
in this manuscript, AlvMFs are likely to act though other IFN-dependent and—independent
mechanism to limit IAV severity. However, our findings raise the possibility that therapeutic
strategies to limit the susceptibility of T1AECs to infection, including blockade or antagonism
of CysLT receptor signaling, early in infection could limit the development and severity of
lower respiratory tract IAV infection.

This study was carried out in strict accordance with the Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 91–
579) and the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of
the National Institutes of Health (OLAW/NIH, 2002). All animal experiments were performed
in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Virginia Animal Care and Use
Committee (ACUC; Protocol Number 2230) [26].
Mice and Infection
All mice were breed and housed in a pathogen-free environment and used at 7–14 weeks of
age for all experiments. NS1-GFP virus was a generous gift from the Adolfo Garcia-Sastre labo-
ratory. Influenza A viruses PR8 (H1N1) and NS1-GFP [27] were grown in the allantoic cavity
of day 10 chicken embryos as described previously [26]. Mice were infected with 250 EID50
units of PR8 (0.1LD50), or 105 EID50 NS1-GFP [26]. All infectious doses were administered i.n.
in 50μL of serum-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) following ketamine
and xylazine anesthesia. For i.n. transfer of cells, 500,000 AlvMFs were given in 50uL of
serum-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) following ketamine and xylazine
anesthesia. Irradiation and bone marrow transplantation mice were irradiated with 9.5 Gy
and, within 24hours, i.v. injected with RBC-lysed bone marrow cells (1–3 × 106) [26]. For
AlvMF depletion CD11c-DTr+ and CD11c-DTr- BALB/C littermates were given 40ng of DTx
i.n. following ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. Acivicin was diluted in serum-free Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) and 2.5mg/kg was given i.n. in 50uL following ketamine

 and xylazine anesthesia. 10mg/kg of Zafirlukast was given daily on days 0–3 PI by i.p. injection
in 1mL of saline with 1%DMSO and 2% hydroxypropyl-β- cyclodextrin (HPCD).
Sample Preparation
Mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation. Lungs were then perfused with PBS via the
heart. Lungs were enzymatically digested with Type II collagenase (37˚C for 30 minutes;
Worthington) for analysis of hematopoietic cells. For epithelial cell analysis lungs were inflated
and digested with Dispase 2 (37˚C for 30 minutes; Invitrogen). Digestion was followed by pas-
sage through a steel mesh screen to remove tissue fragments. Red blood cells in the cell suspen-
sions were lysed using ammonium chloride. Cells were enumerated using a hemocytometer.
Cells were re-suspended in FACS buffer containing PBS, 2% FBS, 10mM EDTA, and 0.01%
sodium azide for Ab staining or MACS buffer containing PBS, 2% FBS, and 10 mM EDTA.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (Cytokine, Viral Titer and Anti-Influenza
IgG)
We obtained BAL fluid by flushing the airways three times with a single inoculum of 500uL
sterile PBS introduced via a trachea incision. BAL fluid cytokine content was determined using
the Luminex 100 IS system maintained by the UVA Flow Cytometry Core. The 30-factors
assayed were: Eotaxin, GM-CSF, IFNg, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-
10, IL12p40, IL-12-70, LIF, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IP-10, KC, MCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, M-CSF,
MIP-2, MIG, RANTES, TNF. Viral titer was determined via endpoint dilution assay and
expressed as tissue culture infectious dose50 (TCID50) units as previously described [26]. We
incubated MDCK cells (ATCC collection) with tenfold dilutions of BAL fluid in serum-free
trypsin supplemented DMEM culture medium. After 3–4 day incubation at 37˚C in a humidi-
fied atmosphere of 5% CO2, culture supernatants were collected and mixed with a half- volume
of 1% chicken red blood cells (University of Virginia Veterinary Facilities) to detect virus repli-
cation by hemagglutination. Detectable hemagglutination indicated virus replication was used
as the calculate sample TCID50 values [26]. Influenza specific IgG antibodies in the airspaces
were quantified by coating ELISA plates with A/PR/8 and incubating with tenfold dilutions of
BAL fluid from influenza virus-infected mice. After washing, anti-mouse IgG was used to detect
the amount of influenza specific IgG antibodies that where present in to BAL fluid at day 11 PI.
Flow Cytometry Staining, Analysis, and Sorting
All FACS antibodies are purchased from BD Biosciences or eBioscience. The dilution of sur-
face staining antibodies was 1 in 200 for 30 min at 4˚C. After antibody staining, we examined
cells using a six or eight-color FACS-Canto system (BD Biosciences) and the data were ana-
lyzed by FlowJo software (Treestar) and FMO or isotype controls were used to set gates. We
characterized the epithelial cell types as follows: Conducting airways (CD45- CD31- T1α-
EpCAM+ MHCII-) and T1AECs (CD45- CD31- T1α+ EpCAM+). AlvMFs were isolated from
whole lungs by MACS enrichment for cells expressing either CD11c or Siglec F according to
manufactures protocol generating around a 90% pure AlvMF population. T1AEC sorting was
done using a modified protocol for sorting cells from culture for RNAseq analysis [51]. Briefly,
T1AECs were stained and sorted directly into Trizol LS from whole lung suspensions in the
presence of RiboLock using the Becton Dickinson Influx Cell Sorter and DEPC treated 1XPBS.
Quantitative Reverse-Transcription PCR
We isolated RNA from the lungs via Triazol (Invitrogen) and treated it with DNase I (Invitro-
gen). We used random primers (Invitrogen) and Superscript II (Invitrogen) to synthesize first-

 strand complementary DNAs from equivalent amounts of RNA from each sample. We per-
formed real-time RT-PCR in a 7000 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Data were generated by the comparative thresh-
old cycle (ΔCT) method by normalizing to HPRT [26]. Forward and reverse primers amplify-
ing are as follows, respectively:

Evans Blue Dye
At the indicated day after infection with influenza, approx. 20mg/kg of Evans Blue dye in
500uL of 1X PBS was administered via the i.v. route. One hour later bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid was obtained as described above. The absorbance of the dye at 620nm and 740nm was
measured in BAL following removal of cells and debris and quantified with a standard curve
obtained at the same time.
Histology
Lungs were inflated with air using a sterile syringe and an intra-tracheal incision. The inflated
lung was tied of and placed into Bouin’s Fix Solution for at least three days. Fixed lungs were
taken to UVA’s Research Histology Core for Paraffin-embedding, slicing and Hematoxylin
and Eosin staining.
Measurement of Pulmonary Function
The MouseOx Pulse-oximeter (Starr Life Sciences, Oakmont PA) was used to measure blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2). Prior to infection thigh hair of all mice was removed. Following
ketamine and xylazine anesthesia, the thigh clamp was placed on the mouse and reading
where taken on each mouse until it recovered from anesthesia. Oxygen saturation measure-
ments were taken during recovery from anesthesia when oxygen saturation measurements had
plateaued and only reading deemed successful by the software were used in our analysis.
LET1 Cell Culture, Infection and Treatment
Let1 cells (a gift from Paul Thomas, St. Jude Hospital) were cultured and infected as previously
described [28]. Briefly, 50,000 LET1 cells/ well were allowed adhere to wells of a 24 well tissue
culture plate for 18hours in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. Cell monolayers were
then washed with OptiMEM to remove serum and non-adherent cells and then infected with
A/PR/8 NS1-GFP in OptiMEM at an M.O.I. of ~100 to insure maximum infection of cells.
Infection was carried out for 24hours, after which cells were liberated from the wells by manual
manipulation. Two wells were pooled for each sample and live cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry for T1α and GFP expression. For co-culture of Let1 cells with AlvMFs, 100,000
AlvMFs were added directly onto the LET1 cells or into transwell inserts at the time of LET1
plating and the same infection protocol mentioned above was followed. All drugs were

 introduced into the LET1 cell cultures at the time of infection at the specified concentrations,
with or without DMSO, in OptiMEM. For stable knockdown of GGT1 in LET1 cells, lentiviral
particles with control scrambled or GGT1 targeted shRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (sc-35474-v) and used according to the manufactures protocol. Briefly, after an
overnight incubation in 12 well plates, media containing Polybrene and 5 or 10uL of lentiviral
particles was added. Cells were incubated overnight at 37˚C and stable infection was selected
for by maintaining the cells in media containing Puromycin dihydrochloride at 5ug/mL. For
transferrin experiments, AlvMFs were exposed to virus for 15 minutes at 4˚and 20min at 37˚.
After virus was washed off the AlvMFs were added to inserts and co-cultured with serum
starved LET1 cells for one hour. pHrodo Red labeled transferrin (molecular probes) was then
added to LET1 cells as per the manufacture’s protocol for 10 minutes at 16˚ followed by a 30
minute incubation at 37˚. Fluorescence intensity was determined by flow cytometry.
RNAseq
Cells were sorted as described above, stored at -80˚C and shipped to BGI Americas in trizol.
There, RNA was isolated, enriched by poly-A-selection, and amplified. Following this samples
were barcoded and sequenced using a 101PE lane on a HiSeq 2000 sequencer by Illumina.
Data were processed with the Tuxedo Suite software package [52]. Paired-reads were
aligned and mapped to the GRCm38 mouse genome assembly, followed by differential expres-
sion analysis. Gene expression pathway analysis was carried out using the DAVID bioinfor-
matics database [37, 38]. GEO accession number GSE93085.
Statistical Analyses
Data are means ± SEM. We used non-paired Student’s t test, one-way ANOVA or two- way
ANOVA for statistical analyses. We considered all P values >0.05 not to be significant.
