ABSTRACT
Objectives To compare utilities for prenatal testing outcomes among women inclined to continue their pregnancy despite
abnormal results versus those inclined to terminate and to analyze how differences affect optimal prenatal testing strategies.
Method Time tradeoff utilities for 23 outcomes were elicited from 281 women. We compared utilities based on
termination inclination and applied them to a decision-analytic framework.
Results Of participants, 46.6% indicated that they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ continue their pregnancy despite
results indicating an intellectual disability. These women assigned higher utilities to abnormal testing results and
having a child with an intellectual disability than women who would probably or definitely terminate. Primary cell-
free DNA screening had the most quality-adjusted life years for women inclined to continue their pregnancy but
yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $1 685 449. Multiple marker screening with either cell-free
DNA or diagnostic testing as follow-up had an ICER of $9037. Primary diagnostic testing resulted in the most
quality-adjusted life years for women inclined to terminate, with an ICER of $111 776.
Conclusion Women seeking testing vary in prenatal testing outcome preferences and termination inclinations in the
context of results indicating an intellectual disability. How they envision utilizing prenatal testing information impacts
their optimal testing strategy. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Decision-making regarding prenatal genetic screening and
diagnostic testing has always been complex, involving tradeoffs
between accuracy and miscarriage risk for which women’s values
are critical. The introduction of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening
and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) has further
complicated this decision-making, with new tests and potential
testing outcomes to consider. While preferences or utilities for
the outcomes of traditional prenatal screening and diagnostic
testing have been available for over a decade,1–4 a recent analysis
of contemporary testing strategies presented utilities for a wider
range of testing strategies and used them to calculate the
quality-of-life impact and cost-effectiveness of each of these
strategies.5
Adding to the complexity of prenatal testing decision-making
are the differing benefits that women perceive when they choose
among screening and diagnostic testing alternatives. While,
historically, most women who received a diagnosis of fetal
trisomy 21 elected to terminate their pregnancy, a systematic
review of papers published between 1995 and 2011 found that
the termination rates in this context vary substantially and may
have decreased over time.6 Along with the increasing numbers
of women undergoing screening for aneuploidy, this suggests
that many women are seeking prenatal testing primarily to obtain

 information without an intention to terminate for abnormal
results. How optimal testing strategies might differ for women
inclined to continue their pregnancy in this context compared
with those inclined to terminate has not been explored.
Our goal was to further explore how women who desire fetal
chromosomal information view the potential outcomes of
the
comprehensive
range
of
prenatal
testing
technologies
currently available and to analyze how these values might affect
their optimal testing strategy. Specifically, we sought to gain a
better understanding of the relationship between the previously
reported utilities and the women’s initial inclinations regarding
how to proceed in the setting of fetal abnormality and to explore
how their thoughts as to whether they would continue or
terminate a pregnancy might influence the prenatal testing
strategy yielding the most quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and
the lowest costs or incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
METHODS
For the original study, we conducted a cross-sectional study of
women seeking care at the prenatal diagnosis center at the
University of California, San Francisco, and the prenatal care clinics
at the University of California, San Francisco, and San Francisco
General Hospital between July 2013 and November 2014. The
methods employed have been published.5 Briefly, women who
were ≥18years of age and carrying a singleton fetus at <20weeks
of gestation were eligible to participate regardless of whether they
had undergone prenatal testing in their current pregnancy. Study
participation
consisted
of
one
face-to-face
interview,
and
participants were given a $40 gift card as remuneration. Institutional
review board approval was obtained from the University of
California, San Francisco, Committee on Human Research, and
the San Francisco General Hospital institutional review board.
After signing informed consent, participants completed a
self-administered questionnaire (Appendix A of Supporting
Information) containing items related to their sociodemographic
characteristics, reproductive history, and use of prenatal testing.
After the first 90 interviews were completed, we added a question
asking ‘If you found out that your baby would have an intellectual
disability (mental retardation), do you think you would continue
or terminate your pregnancy?’ Response options included
‘definitely continue my pregnancy’, ‘probably continue my
pregnancy’, ‘probably terminate my pregnancy’, and ‘definitely
terminate my pregnancy’. Women who answered definitely or
probably continue were categorized as being inclined to continue;
those who answered definitely or probably terminate were
categorized as being inclined to terminate.
Before proceeding to the utility assessments, we provided
participants with descriptions of intellectual disabilities (including
but not limited to Down syndrome), trisomies 13 and 18, and
genetic variant of uncertain significance (VUS), as well as of
multiple
marker
screening
(MMS),
cfDNA
screening,
and
diagnostic testing (chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis
with CMA). The description of MMS included a first-trimester
and second-trimester blood draw and nuchal translucency
ultrasound (Appendix B of Supporting Information).
Utilities quantify preferences for health states or potential
outcomes of clinical decisions, on a scale from 0 = the least
preferred outcome (typically death) to 1 = the ideal outcome.
We used the time tradeoff metric,7,8 which generates utilities
by asking how many years of life the respondent is willing to
give up to avoid a less-than-ideal outcome. The assessment
procedure involved asking participants to choose between
living their full life expectancy with a less desirable outcome
(e.g. giving birth to an infant with an intellectual disability)
and living a shorter time with the ideal outcome (i.e. giving
birth to an infant that does not have an intellectual disability).
The time tradeoff utility is defined as the number of years with
the ideal outcome divided by the number of years with the less
desirable outcome at the point where the assessor is indifferent
between the two options. For example, a woman who is
indifferent to a choice between living for 30 years (a shortened
life expectancy) after giving birth to an infant who does not
have an intellectual disability and living for 40 years (her full
life expectancy) after giving birth to an infant who has an
intellectual disability has a time tradeoff utility for this
outcome of 0.75 (30/40).
We measured utilities for 18 sequences of events during
pregnancy that can result from testing strategies starting with
the following: (1) MMS alone, (2) cfDNA screening alone, (3)
MMS and cfDNA together, or (4) diagnostic testing with CMA
without prior screening, and five different outcomes of
pregnancy: (1) birth of an infant with an intellectual disability,
(2) birth of an infant with a genetic abnormality that is almost
always lethal in the first 2 years (trisomy 13 or 18), (3) birth of
an infant following the identification of a VUS, and (4)
pregnancy loss with or (5) without the birth of an infant in a
subsequent pregnancy. Because failure to obtain results with
cfDNA
indicates
an
increased
risk
of
a
chromosomal
abnormality,9–11 cfDNA screening scenarios yielding no results
explained that ‘this means there is an increased chance that
your baby will have an intellectual disability’.
We employed a three-form design to minimize responder
burden.12 All participants assessed the five pregnancy outcome
scenarios first. The other 18 scenarios were divided into three
groups, and each participant was randomly assigned to evaluate
two of the three groups. The scenarios were read aloud by the
study interviewer while the participant viewed a card that
included a graphic representation of the sequence of events
described. The back of the card listed emotions that might occur
in women who experience the scenario, to help the participants
consider how they might feel about being in the situation
described (Appendix C of Supporting Information).
We began the analysis by calculating summary statistics,
including mean, standard deviation, median, and interquartile
range, for the utilities obtained from the entire group. We then
compared the utilities of women inclined to continue their
pregnancy following the prenatal diagnosis of a condition
associated with intellectual disability with those of women
inclined to terminate, using Student’s t-test.
We next applied the utilities for the two groups of women to
a decision model that we previously created. Details of that
model also have been published.5 Briefly, its perspective is that
of a pregnant woman who desires testing; as such, all strategies
initiate with a screening or diagnostic test. Strategies beginning
with screening can yield positive, negative, or, in the case of
cfDNA screening, no results; these are followed by the options

 of
diagnostic
testing
(with
CMA
analysis),
cfDNA
as
a
secondary screening test, or no additional testing. Potential
outcomes of diagnostic testing include normal or abnormal
results, as well as procedure-related miscarriage, and the
model includes the option of continuing or terminating
the pregnancy following the diagnosis of a chromosomal
abnormality or a variant of uncertain significance. The
probability of future birth following a pregnancy loss is also
included. Probabilities for the model were obtained from the
literature.
In this analysis, utilities from the women inclined to
terminate their pregnancy following the diagnosis of an
affected fetus were applied to the model to calculate quality-
adjusted life expectancy associated with each testing strategy
for that group; in a second analysis, we used utilities from
women who were inclined to continue their pregnancy. As in
the prior analysis, testing utilities were applied for 1 year, while
utilities for long-term outcomes such as birth of a child with a
chromosomal abnormality were applied to the remainder of
the woman’s life.
We included the four testing strategies identified as optimal
in the prior study: (1) MMS, in which women had only the
option of diagnostic testing if additional information was
desired after screening; (2) MMS with the option of either
secondary cfDNA screening or diagnostic testing (with CMA)
if additional information was desired; (3) cfDNA as a primary
screening test, with diagnostic testing if additional information
was
desired;
and
(4)
diagnostic
testing
without
prior
screening.5 For each strategy, we calculated QALYs for women
who reported that they would definitely or probably continue
their pregnancy if they received abnormal results and for
women who indicated that they would definitely or probably
terminate their pregnancy if they received abnormal results.
We then compared the most preferred (defined as having the
most QALYs) strategy for women in each of these two groups.
Because inclinations toward terminating versus continuing
a
pregnancy
in
the
context
of
a
genetic
abnormality
indicative of intellectual disability might be associated with
differences
in
the
likelihood
of
undergoing
invasive
diagnostic testing and pregnancy termination after receiving
abnormal results, we conducted two additional analyses. In
the first analysis, we assumed that the probability that
women who were inclined to continue their pregnancy
would undergo an invasive diagnostic test was only 10%
and that the likelihood of termination in the setting of
abnormal results was also only 10%. In the second analysis,
we assumed that 90% of women who were inclined to
terminate would opt for invasive testing and that 90% of
these women would terminate their pregnancy if the fetus
was found to have a genetic abnormality associated with
intellectual disability.

 least one miscarriage, and 22.8% reported having terminated a
pregnancy), most participants were college graduates (82.5%),
had private insurance (78.3%), and were married or living with
their partner (88.6%), reflecting the characteristics of women
seen at our institution who desire testing.
Almost all (90.4%) of the participants had undergone some
type of testing. Most (84.0%) had met with a genetic
counselor; for the majority, this involved a brief visit at the
time of a nuchal translucency ultrasound to present normal
first-trimester screening results rather than complete, formal
genetic counseling. While nearly all participants felt that
knowing whether their child would have an intellectual
disability (98%) and avoiding a false positive result (96.5%)
were ‘somewhat’ or ‘very’ important, the sample was divided
as to whether they thought that they would continue (46.6%)
or terminate (53.4%) their pregnancy following the prenatal
diagnosis of a genetic condition associated with intellectual
disability.
Not surprisingly, scenarios involving low-risk results from a
screening test (0.931) or normal diagnostic testing results,
regardless of whether the diagnostic testing was preceded by
screening (0.921–0.928), received the highest mean utility
scores from the group as a whole (Table 2). A lower mean
utility was assigned to the scenario in which MMS and cfDNA
screening
yielded
discordant
results
when
performed
sequentially (i.e. positive MMS results followed by negative
cfDNA screening results, 0.890), while an even lower score
was
obtained
for
having
the
two
tests
performed
simultaneously and receiving discordant results (positive
MMS and negative cfDNA screening results, 0.850).
Scenarios
ending
with
a
pregnancy
loss,
including
termination in the context of abnormal results or results
indicative of a VUS or as a result of a procedure-related
miscarriage, all received low scores. However, pregnancy losses
(either termination or miscarriage) following diagnostic testing
received higher scores when the diagnostic test was preceded
by
increased
risk
screening
results
(0.771
vs
0.725
for
termination following abnormal results, 0.762 vs 0.694 for
termination in the context of a VUS, and 0.744 vs 0.633 for
procedure-related
miscarriage)
as
compared
with
being
performed as a primary test without screening.
Among the five birth outcome scenarios, the highest utility
was assigned to a pregnancy loss followed by the birth of a
healthy baby within 2 years (0.880). Having a baby with a VUS
yielded a somewhat lower value (0.737). Very low scores were
obtained for experiencing a pregnancy loss without a future
birth (0.590), having a child with trisomy 13 or 18 (0.495), or
having a child with an intellectual disability (0.480).
Substantial differences emerged when we compared the
values obtained from women who were inclined to continue
their pregnancy if a condition associated with an intellectual
disability was detected versus those who were inclined to
terminate. For example, women inclined to continue had
higher mean utilities for receiving increased risk MMS results
and foregoing further testing (0.802 vs 0.694, p = 0.03) and for
continuing their pregnancy after receiving increased risk
MMS and then positive cfDNA screening results (0.768 vs
0.620, p = 0.002), abnormal diagnostic testing results (0.766 vs
0.556, p < 0.001), or results indicative of a VUS (0.859 vs 0.715,
p = 0.001) when compared with women inclined to terminate.
They also had much higher utilities for the scenario involving
the birth of a baby with an intellectual disability (0.621 vs
0.396, p < 0.001). Interestingly, there was no difference in the
mean value that these two groups assigned to giving birth to
a baby with trisomy 13 or 18 (0.493 vs 0.477, p = 0.73). While
the mean score for having a baby with a VUS was higher
among women who were inclined to continue, the difference
did not reach statistical significance (0.771 vs 0.701, p = 0.09).
When the utilities of women who were inclined to continue
their pregnancy were applied to our decision-analytic model,
diagnostic testing without prior screening was the least
effective and most expensive option. MMS with only the option
of invasive diagnostic testing increased QALYs and was the
least expensive option. MMS with the option of cfDNA
screening as a follow-up test further increased QALYs, with
an ICER of only $9037 per QALY (Table 3). While cfDNA
screening as a first-line test yielded the most QALYs, it was also
the most costly approach, with an ICER of $1 685 449 per QALY.
In contrast, when the utilities of women who were inclined to
terminate were utilized, going straight to diagnostic testing
without first having a screening test became the strategy that
yielded the most QALYs, with an ICER of $111 776 per QALY.

terminating a pregnancy after results indicating a condition
associated
with
intellectual
disability
to
10%
and
10%,
respectively, for women who were inclined to continue their
pregnancy in this context and to 90% and 90%, respectively,
for women who were inclined to terminate yielded similar
findings. While the ICER for starting with cfDNA screening

 lower than that obtained in the base case for women who were
inclined to continue their pregnancy, at $793 100 per QALY, it
was still well beyond the threshold of $100 000 per QALY. For
women who were inclined to terminate, going straight to
invasive diagnostic testing without first having a screening test
still yielded the most QALYs, with a slightly lower ICER than in
the base case ($104 739).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that the process of testing, even in the
context of normal screening or diagnostic testing results, is
associated with decrements in quality of life. While the highest
utility was assigned to undergoing a screening test and receiving
low-risk results, the mean score was 0.931. To put this in context,
this value is similar to the mean time tradeoff utility for having a
planned repeat cesarean delivery and experiencing surgical
complications (0.931)13 or to having a pap smear, receiving
abnormal results, undergoing a colposcopy, and receiving
normal results (0.927) in the setting of post-cervical interstitial
neoplasia 2+ surveillance.14 And while scenarios ending in
normal results were ranked higher than the other pregnancy
scenarios, the process of getting to those results mattered, as
evidenced by the range of mean utilities that we obtained for
different scenarios ending with this same ultimate outcome.
Our study has several other interesting findings, many of
which
may
differ
from
common
assumptions
regarding
women’s preferences for different testing approaches. For
example, it is notable that a lower utility was assigned to going
straight to a diagnostic test and receiving normal results, as
compared with having one or even two positive screening tests
before undergoing diagnostic testing. It appears that for this
population, the ‘diagnostic odyssey’ involving an extended
sequence of tests is preferable to having a diagnostic test
without a ‘compelling’ reason. In addition, participants were
more reassured by a negative cfDNA result following a positive
MMS result than by concurrent receipt of these same results.
This difference suggests that women may view discordant
results
on
concurrent
screening
tests
as
a
distressing
discrepancy while they view having a normal cfDNA screening
result after screen positive MMS as a reassuring follow-up test.
It also supports recommendations from the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal
Fetal Medicine, who note that ‘[p]arallel or simultaneous testing
with multiple screening methodologies for aneuploidy is not
cost-effective and should not be performed’.15 Finally, women
assigned higher value to the reassurance provided by diagnostic
testing in comparison with cfDNA testing following screen
positive MMS results, suggesting that normal cfDNA results did
not confer the same level of reassurance as normal diagnostic
testing results. In clinical practice, this difference will depend on
the pretest and posttest counseling provided regarding the
implications of such results.
We also found substantial variation in how women who desire
testing anticipated using the information. While nearly all
participants had elected to undergo some type of prenatal testing,
they differed substantially in what they felt they would do if their
fetus had a genetic abnormality associated with intellectual
disability, differences that were reflected in the utilities that they
assigned
to
outcomes
involving
abnormal
testing
results,
pregnancy termination, and the birth of an affected infant. As a
result, the most preferred (i.e. yielding the most QALYs) strategy
differed depending on whether women were inclined to continue
or terminate their pregnancy in this situation.
Not
unexpectedly,
women
who
were
more
likely
to
terminate
their
pregnancy
in
the
context
of
a
genetic
abnormality causing intellectual disability had higher QALYs
associated with diagnostic testing (with CMA) – they placed
more
value
on
detection.
For
these
women,
the
cost-
effectiveness of undergoing diagnostic testing without prior
screening was just over $100 000 per QALY, a threshold that
has been used to define cost-effective interventions.16
In contrast, women who were unlikely to choose termination
in the context of a genetic abnormality causing intellectual
disability were more tolerant of strategies with a lower
detection rate. For them, cfDNA as a first-line test yielded the
most QALYs, although this approach was not cost-effective,

line test for these women yielded a much more reasonable
ICER of about $9000 per QALY.
ur study has several important limitations. First, while we
successfully recruited a racially/ethnically diverse group of
women,
most
participants
were
of
relatively
high
socioeconomic status. Also, we primarily recruited women
who presented for care at our institution’s prenatal diagnosis
center, most of whom had already undergone some form of
prenatal genetic testing. Whether their preferences would have
been different if we had measured them prior to testing is
unknown. In addition, participants in our study were given
extensive information about the interpretation of positive,
negative, and no results after cfDNA screening, along with the
range of outcomes associated with a VUS. In clinical practice,
women’s evaluation of these test results will vary depending
on the counseling that they receive. Also, because we were
interested
in
how
women
view
intellectual
disability,
regardless of etiology, our description of Down syndrome
focused primarily on this aspect of the condition.
Importantly, because we were interested in measuring
preferences of women who desired testing, results of this study
are generalizable only to this group, which does not include all
pregnant
women.
(In
a
recent
study
of
710
pregnant
sociodemographically diverse women, 25.6% of the women
randomized to view a decision support guide decided to forego
prenatal testing altogether.17) Strengths of our study include
the large sample of women from whom utilities were obtained,
the comprehensive list of scenarios assessed, the focus on
intellectual disabilities in general (rather than solely Down
syndrome), and use of a detailed decision-analytic framework
to calculate QALYs.
CONCLUSION
We believe that our findings have important implications
for
clinical
guidelines
and
practice.
First,
this
study
demonstrates that preferences for the alternative prenatal
testing strategies vary, underscoring the continued need
for preference-flexible guidelines. Our findings also suggest
that providers need to present clear information and engage
patients in values clarification to help them choose the best
strategy for them. This includes asking patients to consider
what they think they might do if they were to receive
abnormal results. While some providers may prefer to
discuss these inclinations only following an abnormal test
result, the extent to which the utilities and optimal testing
strategy differed depending on these initial inclinations
suggests that it might be helpful to begin this conversation
before patients initiate testing.
WHAT’S ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC?
• In our previous analysis of the expected clinical outcomes, quality-
adjusted life years, and costs associated with six different prenatal
testing strategies, we found that strategies beginning with multiple
marker screening were optimal for most women.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?
• We compare utilities of women inclined to continue their pregnancy
after receiving results indicating a condition associated with
intellectual disability with those of women inclined to terminate,
demonstrating substantial differences.
• We show that these differences affect the preferred prenatal testing
strategy.
