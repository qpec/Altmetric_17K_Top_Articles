Resistance to oestrogen-deprivation therapy is common in oestrogen-receptor-positive
(ER þ ) breast cancer. To better understand the contributions of tumour heterogeneity and
evolution to resistance, here we perform comprehensive genomic characterization of 22
primary tumours sampled before and after 4 months of neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor
(NAI) treatment. Comparing whole-genome sequencing of tumour/normal pairs from the two
time points, with coincident tumour RNA sequencing, reveals widespread spatial and
temporal heterogeneity, with marked remodelling of the clonal landscape in response to NAI.
Two cases have genomic evidence of two independent tumours, most obviously an
ER �
‘collision tumour’, which was only detected after NAI treatment of baseline
ER þ disease. Many mutations are newly detected or enriched post treatment, including two
ligand-binding domain mutations in ESR1. The observed clonal complexity of the ER þ breast
cancer genome suggests that precision medicine approaches based on genomic analysis of a
single specimen are likely insufficient to capture all clinically significant information.

espite the success of therapeutic approaches that suppress
oestrogen production or inhibit ER function, resistance to
endocrine therapy is common and accounts for the
majority of breast cancer deaths1. The identification of endocrine
resistance in primary ER þ breast cancer is a critical endeavour
that has been widely explored2,3 but the current transcriptional
profiling approaches do not typically identify drivers of resistance,
nor do they take into account resistance mechanisms that evolve
from a minor subpopulation of cells.
Breast
carcinomas
are
driven
by
accumulated
somatic
alterations. Those present in the initiating cell define the founder
clone and persist in every cell of the tumour. As tumours grow,
they accumulate additional mutations and these may give
rise to subclonal populations with distinct characteristics4,5.
These
subpopulations
compete
and
evolve6–9
and
often
harbour mutations that eventually confer resistance to specific
therapies9–13. When this occurs, the resistant tumour cells will
represent a proportionally larger fraction of the tumour mass, as
the susceptible population diminishes.
Another source of heterogeneity is synchronous breast cancer,
most obviously when the disease is bilateral at diagnosis, or
when two tumours are far apart in the same breast. These
events are clinically significant as bilateral disease can signify
the presence of a germline predisposition as well as a worse
prognosis14. However when several independent breast cancers
evolve in very close proximity, it can be impossible, without
genomic techniques, to diagnose ‘collision tumours’ with different
founder clones. The incidence of collision tumours of the breast
and their clinical significance is therefore unknown, with most of
the literature focused on tumours of different tissue origins
growing together at a metastatic site15.
While subclonal heterogeneity has been extensively studied in
breast cancer16,17, little is known about the interplay between clonal
evolution and therapy response. The effects of short-term (14 day)
aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment have been explored on the
transcriptomic level using microarrays18,19, but it is unclear what
population changes these expression differences reflect, that is,
whether existing cells are being ‘remodelled’ at the transcriptional
level, or whether the changes are due to continued expansion of
cells harbouring resistance mutations. The effects of longer-term AI
inhibition at the whole-genome level remain unknown.
In this study, we provide a first step towards answering these
questions by comprehensively characterizing the effects of
neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (NAI) therapy on the genomes
and
transcriptomes
of
a
group
of
ER-positive
breast
tumours. From a set of previously whole-genome sequenced
(WGS) tumours20, we selected 22 Luminal A or Luminal B
subtype
tumours
classified
as
either
‘aromatase-inhibitor-
sensitive’ (N ¼ 12, median surgical Ki67 ¼ 1.1%, range 0–7.0%)
or ‘aromatase-inhibitor-resistant’ (N ¼ 10, median surgical Ki67
24.6%, range 10.4–47.1%). For each of these patients, we
then performed WGS on matching tumours sampled by core
biopsy at surgical resection, as well as on additional core biopsies
taken from a subset of the baseline (pre-treatment, N ¼ 5) and
surgical
resection
tumours
(post-treatment,
N ¼ 6).
RNA
sequencing was performed on 20 of the baseline tumours and
on 18 of the surgical tumours. To obtain additional information
on treatment emergent mutations, a subset of these tumours,
along
with
38
additional
cases
were
analysed
at
greater
sequencing depth using targeted capture with a gene panel.
Together, these data allow us to characterize the genomic
landscapes and clonal architectures of breast tumours and show
that they are often dramatically altered during NAI therapy.
Results
Mutational landscape. Comprehensive genomic characterization
of these 22 patients’ tumours (Table 1, Supplementary Data 1)
revealed a total of 42,300 somatic single-nucleotide variants
(SNVs) and indels in non-repetitive loci (tiers 1–3; ref. 21) of all
tumour samples, with a median of 947 somatic SNVs and 23 indels
per tumour (Supplementary Data 2 and 3). A total of 2,061 somatic

The clonal instability index is a metric of the amount of evolutionary change observed in the tumour, where higher numbers represent larger shifts and an index of 1 indicates completely unrelated
tumours were present. A value of 0 indicates a monoclonal tumour with no post-treatment shift in clonality. Methodology to calculate the clonal instability index is defined in detail in the ‘Methods’
section. BL refers to baseline and SURG the pathology specimen from the surgical resection after 16 to 18 weeks of AI therapy.

 variants were in the coding regions of the resulting proteins, with a
median of 55 per patient. One tumour, BRC26, harboured a low
mutation count (55), likely due to lower sequence coverage
(Supplementary Data 4). Coding variant counts included 1,166
coding-region SNVs and indels not detected in the original study
of the baseline tumours, obtained both from analysis of the surgical
samples and via deeper sequencing coverage of baseline samples.
Of these, 256 were absent or low frequency (o5% variant allele
fraction (VAF) in the baseline samples, making them challenging
or impossible to detect from standard-depth WGS without infor-
mation from postsurgical or second core biopsy samples. The
number of detectable low-frequency mutations was also impacted
by tumour purity, which ranged from 12 to 100% (Supplementary
Data 4). We identified 72 expressed coding mutations specific
to the surgical samples, based on our limits of detection
(Supplementary Note 1).
Copy number profiles were largely concordant between
baseline and surgical samples, with a few notable exceptions
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Eight samples harboured at least one
event greater than 100 Mb in size that differed between the
baseline and surgical samples, including one tumour (BRC48)
that changed from diploid to triploid over the course of
treatment. We also detected and validated a total of 1,695
structural variants (SVs) across 55 samples. The mean value was
30 SVs per sample (range 1 to 141) and had no significant
correlation with either AI response or EFS (Supplementary
Data 5). Overall, 71.8% of validated SVs present in the surgical
samples were also detected in the baseline samples. Gene fusion-
causing alterations were detected in 21 of 22 patients, with only
moderate concordance between multiple samples from the same
individual (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Data 6).
No fusions
involving ESR1 were observed.

Subclonal inference by clustering of variant allele fractions.
Using somatic mutations from all the samples for each patient, we
applied the SciClone algorithm22 to cluster the VAFs of
copy-number
neutral
SNVs,
thus
inferring
the
clonal
architecture of each sample (Supplementary Fig. 7). Two
samples, BRC17 and BRC48, had large-scale ploidy changes,
which prevented accurate automated clustering of the clonal
subpopulations, and a third case, BRC18, had a very high
mutation rate and insufficient separation between clusters. The
remaining 19 cases included 11 time points with multiple core
biopsies. Several patterns of altered subclonal composition and
evolution were observed in the context of AI treatment response,
and are described below.
Intertwined tumours of independent origin. In one patient
(BRC38), the surgical tumour shared no somatic SNVs or indels
with the baseline tumour, despite having matching identity from
germline SNP concordance (Fig. 1a). The ER þ baseline tumour
contained a CDH1 splice-site mutation in the founder clone, and

 subclonal missense mutations in FOXA1 and FOXQ1. The sur-
gical tumour specifically lacked these mutations or indeed other
SNVs or indels in genes strongly implicated in cancer, but had
focal
amplifications
containing
MYC,
EGFR
and
CCND1
(Fig. 1b). Although the baseline tumour also had amplified MYC
and CCND1, these were distinct events with breakpoints different
than those observed in the surgical tumour. Both tumours
contained numerous other copy number alterations, but none
were shared except for a 1q amplification (with unresolvable
breakpoints in the centromere). This event may have occurred in
a shared cell of origin, or may be a case of homoplasy. Several
gene fusions also were detected with no overlap between these
two ‘collision’ tumours.
RNAseq data from this patient’s tumour samples reveal a
transition
from
baseline
ER-positive
(FPKM
131.65)
to
post-treatment ER-negative (FPKM of 0.99), and ER immuno-
histochemistry supported this observation, with ER Allred scores
of 8 in the pre-treatment sample and 2 in the sequenced surgical
sample (Fig. 1c–e, Supplementary Data 7). A second IHC result
from a different portion of the post-treatment surgical sample
showed residual ER-positivity, suggesting that the two tumours
continued to co-exist, but that the surgical core we sequenced did
not capture the ER-positive residual tumour. There was a 3-fold
increase in Ki67 between baseline and surgery and this patient
was classified as AI-resistant.
A second patient, BRC21, contained genomic evidence for a
cryptic second tumour, inferred via a pattern of subclonal
evolution that is impossible to explain with only a single tumour
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Specifically, the variants in cluster 3
shifted from nearly absent at baseline to a VAF that was greater
than any other cluster at surgery. This pattern suggests retention
of the baseline tumour, coupled with the emergence of a second
tumour containing a PIK3CA mutation (H1047R). These two
tumours comprise 19 and 28 percent of the surgical sample,
respectively, and this combined percentage is more parsimonious
with the 70% estimate from pathology than would be a
single-tumour solution with purity of less than 30%. Unlike
BRC38, both appear to be ER þ
tumours, with an Allred
score at surgery of 6. Though both measures are limited
somewhat by the low purity of the surgical sample, this patient
was classified as AI-sensitive, and switched from an intrinsic
subtype of LumA to Normal-like.
Simple and clonally stable tumours. Only a single sample,
BRC14, harboured no detectable subclonal cell populations, either
at baseline or following AI treatment (Fig. 2). This tumour was
categorized as AI-sensitive. In keeping with AI responsiveness, the
tumour intrinsic subtype switched from Luminal B to Luminal A.
Complex and dynamic tumours. Eighteen patients (81.8%) had
tumours containing multiple subclonal cell populations, some of
which were substantially altered during the course of treatment. In
BRC15, the two baseline samples had similar clonal composition,
but the two surgical samples contained significant spatial hetero-
geneity as well as extensive remodelling of the clonal architecture
(Fig. 3, Supplementary Note 4). This tumour had over 2.5-fold
higher ESR1 mRNA expression levels at surgery than at baseline
and was sensitive to aromatase-inhibitor treatment as determined
by the drop in Ki67 level from 24 to 1%.
Four-dimensional clustering revealed a founder clone and four
subclones. The founder clone contained expressed mutations in
PIK3CA (H1047R) and ARID2 (frameshift insertion). Cluster two
was the dominant subclone in the pre-treatment sample and
post-treatment sample 2, but comprised only about 11% of
post-treatment
sample
1.
Cluster
three,
which
contained
expressed mutations in BRAF (K601E) and MSH6 (nonsense),
made up 92% of the baseline tumour, but was absent in the
post-treatment samples, suggesting that it harboured enhanced
susceptibility
to
oestrogen
deprivation.
Cluster
four
was
undetectable in the baseline samples (limit of detection B1%
VAF), but constituted 89% of post-treatment core 2, where clonal
expansion may have been driven by a second mutation in
PIK3CA (G118D). Similarly, cluster 5 was absent pre-treatment
but present only in post-treatment core 1. The copy number
profiles between all samples were largely concordant, with notable
differences including amplification of chromosome 8 in surgical
sample 1 and deletion of one copy of chromosome 9 in surgical
sample 2. Three samples from the periphery of this tumour
(all classified as Ductal Carcinoma in situ) were obtained from the
surgical formalin-fixed block; all carried the founder clone
BIRC6 and PIK3CA mutations, and one carried the BRAF
mutation found in cluster 3. Additional descriptions of these
sample genotypes can be found in the Supplementary Note 5
and Supplementary Data 8.

 BRC41 provides another striking example of tumour evolution
under oestrogen deprivation, with almost complete loss of a
subclone that comprised 86% of the baseline tumour cells
(Supplementary Fig. 7). This subclone loss was coincident with
the emergence of a rare subclone that was present in about 2% of
baseline tumour cells, but expanded to 84% of the surgical sample.
The responsive baseline subclone included an expressed KDM8
(R227H) histone demethylase mutation. The emergent resistant
subclone contained an expressed mutation in BCAS3 (K533N), a
gene with some evidence linking it to tamoxifen resistance23.
Unlike BRC15, the paired core samples taken at baseline and at
surgery were highly concordant, suggesting minimal spatial
heterogeneity in this tumour.
In addition to these two cases, 13 other tumours were
computationally classified as clonally complex and dynamic
(Supplementary Fig. 7). To do so, we used the mean absolute
difference in clonal fractions before and after treatment to derive
a clonal instability index, where 0 indicates no change in clonal
architecture
and
1
indicates
completely
distinct
tumours
(see ‘Methods’ section, Supplementary Data 10). Among the 15
patients in this complex and dynamic group, we observed clonal
instability values ranging from 0.25 to 0.90 (median 0.53),
reflecting the large degree of temporal change in clonality during
NAI treatment. Three additional cases were manually assigned to
this category, for a total of 18 complex and dynamic tumours. Of
these, 10 were characterized as responsive and 8 were resistant to
AI. There was no significant correlation between clonal instability
and AI response, as measured by either reduction in Ki67 or
Ki67 at surgery. We observed intrinsic subtype switching
in nine of these samples, with all changing from Luminal B to
Luminal A.
Complex and stable tumours. Only one sample (BRC11) had
detectable subclonal populations, but showed little evidence of
treatment-induced remodelling, with a clonal instability score of
0.097 (Fig. 4). The likely founder clone carried missense mutations
in ARID1A (p.A1239T), PIK3CA (p.H1047R) and a frame-shift
deletion in TP53. The tumour was classified as treatment-resistant
with Ki67 rising from 0.25 to 0.417 at surgery.
Targeted sequencing and treatment-associated heterogeneity.
To examine AI treatment-associated changes at the level of a
sequencing panel typical of clinical NGS-based diagnostic assays,
we developed a hybrid capture panel to sequence 83 breast
cancer-related genes in 19 of the WGS cases, plus an additional 38

 pre/post pairs (Table 2, Supplementary Note 5, Supplementary
Data 11 and 12). Of these 57 sample sets, 38 (from both groups)
had paired baseline and surgical samples as described above, the
other 19 had samples from baseline and end of treatment
(most of which were triaged to chemotherapy). The mean depth
of coverage was � 103.4 in this assay, compared with a mean of
� 44.1 in the WGS and � 79.4 from the combined WGS and
validation sequencing on the original 22 patients
We identified a total of 255 mutations from this panel test
(median 3 per patient), three of which occur in genes that are
high-priority drug targets. The ESR1 D538G mutation is a
well-recognized
ligand-binding
domain
(LBD)
mutation,
associated with ligand-independent transcriptional activity24,25
and was present only in the post-treatment sample (11% VAF).
The low post-treatment Ki67 suggests, however, that at 11% the
ESR1 D538G allele was not yet sufficiently dominant to produce
elevated
proliferation
despite
AI

treatment-emergent LBD mutation was K481N, present at 14%
VAF at baseline and B40% VAF post treatment. The increasing
VAF of this K481N mutation was associated with Ki67-defined
resistance, since the Ki67 was 11% in the post-treatment sample,
sufficiently high to elevate the risk of relapse26. A third LBD
mutation, E380Q, was present at a low frequency at baseline
without enrichment suggesting that this mutation does not
strongly confer AI resistance, as suggested by an earlier study of
ER þ patient-derived xenografts17.
To determine whether somatic mutations in particular genes
were driving clonal response, we calculated the difference
between pre-treatment and post-treatment VAFs for each gene
with at least five non-silent mutations (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Though NCOR1 mutations, in particular, trended towards higher
VAFs in the post-treatment samples, a larger cohort would be
needed to establish significance in the context of multiple testing
correction. There also was no significant difference in VAF shifts
between mutations in different PIK3CA hotspots (near amino
acids 1,047 or 543) or between mutations in different TP53
domains (DNA-binding versus other).
Discussion
In this study, we performed deep genomic characterization of
primary ER þ breast tumours at baseline and after 16 to 18 weeks
of AI therapy. By combining genomic sequencing data at high
depth on mutated sites, copy number and structural variant
discovery, comparisons of RNA expression to derive intrinsic
subtypes, and clinical pathology markers such as Ki67 and ER
Allred scores, we have generated comprehensive information
about the range of changes that occur when ER þ breast cancers
are subjected to oestrogen deprivation. Overall, four genomic
patterns were observed: (1) two intertwined but genomically
separate ‘collision tumour’ patterns; (2) ‘clonally simple and
treatment stable’ patterns; (3) ‘clonally complex and treatment
dynamic’ patterns; and (4) ‘clonally complex and treatment
stable’ patterns.
In two cases, we observed collision tumours comprised
separate malignancies, and in one case an ER þ tumour with
indolent clinical features was replaced by an ER � tumour with
aggressive
clinical features.
Presumably
the ER �
tumour
genotype was missed in the pre-treatment sample, and became
more readily detectable over time due to the regression of the
ER þ tumour. It is well recognized that a subset of ER þ breast
cancers have ‘lost’ ER expression upon relapse27, and earlier
studies report that ER loss in the context of neoadjuvant
endocrine therapy is associated with a much higher risk of
relapse26. Together, these suggest that comparative ER testing
should be repeated on residual breast tumours after NAI therapy
to identify discernable changes in ER positivity.
Clonally stable tumours were rare in this cohort, with only one
simple and one complex tumour. The simple tumour (BRC14)
switched from Luminal B to Luminal A with a dramatic decline in
Ki67 (44.2 to 1.2%). The complex tumour (BRC11) likely
contained innate resistance in the founder clone (with no
evidence of sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of AI),
which enabled it to maintain both its clonal structure and its
intrinsic subtype despite treatment.
Most tumours analysed (18 of 22) were clonally heterogeneous
and contained subclonal populations whose relative proportions
changed, often dramatically, during AI treatment. This high
clonal instability, over 4 months of AI treatment, was likely due to
a selective growth advantage for a subclone in the presence of
oestrogen deprivation. While it is hard to disprove the null
hypothesis, that is, we are simply observing spatial heterogeneity
in a very complex tumour, cases like BRC41 displayed very high
levels of temporal change with little difference between spatially

Few resistance mechanisms were revealed by this study, as only
two ESR1 mutations were treatment emergent at the 16 to 18
week time point and no ESR1 translocations were detected by
WGS or RNA seq17. This suggests that ESR1 mutation-driven
resistant subclones emerge over long periods of time, although
the presence of several easily detectable ESR1 mutations at
B100X coverage suggests that deeper sequencing might be
important to detecting these mutations at an early-on treatment
time point. The ALTERNATE neoadjuvant endocrine therapy
trial is comparing an AI with fulvestrant, an ER-degrading agent
(NCT01953588). The sample size for ALTERNATE (over 1,000
patients) and the longer duration of treatment before surgery
(24 weeks) will eventually allow hypotheses based on detecting
low frequency ESR1 mutant alleles in the post-treatment sample
to be explored more thoroughly, and will determine whether the
choice of endocrine agent influences the rate at which ESR1
mutations evolve.
Interestingly, two tumours were diagnosed with activating
ERBB2 mutations28, however, both were in AI-sensitive tumours,
with very low on-treatment KI67 values. This suggests, at
least anecdotally, that ERBB2 activating mutations do not cause
intrinsic endocrine therapy resistance, with high on-AI-treatment
Ki67 values that were noted when studying HER2 amplified ER þ
tumours in the neoadjuvant endocrine setting29. One other
treatment emergent mutation in ERBB2 was noted, S157F, but the
functional significance of the mutation is uncertain. A final point
about mutation-driven therapeutic hypotheses concerns the
pre- and post-treatment PIK3CA data. It has been previously
reported that there is no interaction between PIK3CA mutation
status and response to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy20,30.The
lack of positive or negative selection for PIK3CA mutations
observed in the present study is compatible with this conclusion.

 but not at baseline, two were collision tumours, where the second
tumour containing mutant PIK3CA was missed by the initial
biopsies. Thus,
spatial heterogeneity
explains this
pattern,
and also is the likely cause of the apparent gain of a G118D
mutation in one of the BRC15 post-treatment samples. This is
supported by the lack of trend toward positive or negative
selection in the 16 kinase domain mutant cases studied herein
(Table 3).
In conclusion, caution needs to be exercised when interpreting
clinical genomic results from a single core biopsy at a single time
point. Higher depth of massively parallel sequencing, coupled
with analysis tools to detect low-VAF variants, analysis of
multiple tumour samples and tracking of genomic evolution in
post-therapy samples all provide a more complete picture. These
are feasible techniques, as we illustrate, and the data we report can
be considered a proof of principle, supporting the idea that
investment is needed to collect and study very large cohorts in
such a manner. These studies will ultimately determine the
clinical utility of genomic analysis in ER þ breast cancer that is
more comprehensive than that afforded by analysis of a single
pre-treatment sample.
Methods
Sample acquisition and clinical characterization. The samples were from two
neoadjuvant endocrine therapy trials of postmenopausal women with clinical stage
II to III ER-positive (Allred score 6–8) breast cancer (ACOSOG-Z1031, Alliance,
NCT00265759 and NCT00084396) that have been previously described31,32.
All the samples were studied that had appropriate consents, at least 70% tumour
content (by nuclei), and available DNA from both the baseline and surgical time
points.
Genomic library preparation and sequencing. Library preparation was
performed on DNA extracted from flash-frozen fresh tissue biopsies and matched
peripheral blood, then sequenced. Both were done as described previously20.
Copy number and structural variant detection. Copy number aberrations
were detected using CopyCat v1.6.9 (https://github.com/chrisamiller/copycat)
(Supplementary Software 2), with purity estimates derived from SNV allele
fractions. (Table 1) Structural variants were detected as previously described20,33.
For measurement of concordance, SVs were considered to be the same event if the
ends of each call were localized within 500 bp. Gene fusions were identified using
INTEGRATE v0.1e, with default parameters34.
SNV and indel detection. We detected SNVs using the union of three callers: (1)
samtools version r963 [2] (params: -A -B) filtered by SNP-filter version v1 and
intersected with Somatic Sniper version 1.0.2 [3] (params: -F vcf -q 1 -Q 15)
filtered by false-positive version v1 (params: --bam-readcount-version 0.4 --bam-
readcount-min-base-quality 15) then somatic-score-mapping-quality version v1
(params:--min-mapping-quality 40 --min-somatic-score 40); (2) VarScan 2.2.6 [4]
filtered by varscan-high-confidence version v1 then false-positive version v1
(params: --bam-readcount-version 0.4 --bam-readcount-min-base-quality 15);
(3) Strelka version 0.4.6.2 [5] (params: isSkipDepthFilters ¼ 0).
Short insertions and deletions were detected using the union of four callers: (1)
gatk-somatic-indel version 5336 [6] filtered by false-indel version v1
(params: --bam-readcount-version 0.4 --bam-readcount-min-base-quality 15); (2)
pindel version 0.5 [7] filtered by pindel-somatic-calls version v1 then
pindel-vaf-filter version v1 (params: --variant-freq-cutoff ¼ 0.08) then pindel-read-
support version v1; (3) VarScan 2.2.6 [6] filtered by varscan-high-confidence-indel
version v1 then false-indel version v1 (params: --bam-readcount-version
0.4 --bam-readcount-min-base-quality 15); (4) Strelka version 0.4.6.2 [5]
(params: isSkipDepthFilters ¼ 0).
For SNVs and Indels in tier 2 and 3, we retained all variant calls that were also
called in the deep validation data. Additional steps were taken to enhance the
number of coding variants recovered, including pooling of discovery (WGS) and
validation (capture) data to provide enhanced coverage. A binomial log-likelihood

 filter (https://github.com/genome/genome/blob/master/lib/perl/Genome/Model/
Tools/Validation/IdentifyOutliers.pm) was applied to variant calls with at least
10 � sequence coverage in both tumour and normal samples, and those identified
as somatic with LLR43 were retained. Review of mutational hotspots was used to
recover additional variants in breast cancer-related genes.
Variant validation. Mutations in the 22 WGS samples from the original paper
were validated using custom capture arrays targeted to the mutations in each
tumour, as previously described20. After sequencing the post-AI samples, a second
round of custom capture validation was performed on all 77 samples from these 22
patients, by combining the somatic mutation sites predicted in both the baseline
and surgical samples. All coding SNVs, indels and SVs were targeted for validation,
along with a random subset of non-coding variants, providing additional sequence
coverage for validation and clonality analysis. No Sanger sequencing validation was
performed. Controlled tests of our somatic mutation calling pipeline (with similar
configuration to that used here) have established a positive predictive value of over
90% for mutations down to VAFs of B5%, so we expect the baseline false-positive
rate to be low in these data. Results from the validation sequencing pipeline were
then subjected to extensive manual review to validate the presence of variants and
remove additional false-positive somatic calls. This involved manually inspecting
sequencing reads using the Integrated Genomic Viewer (IGV), and flagging a
number of different types of sequencing artifacts, including: insertions and
deletions at the ends of homopolymer runs, calls that were present in the matched
normal sample (or other normal samples), and regions with substantial numbers of
low-or-zero quality mapping scores, indicating potential reference build problems
or mapping artifacts. A similar process was used to inspect copy number calls,
removing those resulting from alignment errors in highly repetitive regions of the
genome or that span assembly gaps or centromeres.
Baseline and surgical-specific variants. Variant allele fractions of all tier 1 var-
iants were corrected for purity by reducing the number of reference-supporting reads
in proportion to the purity of the sample. This effectively scales up the VAFs in such
a way that founding clone variants are near 50% VAF. At each variant position,
Fisher’s exact test was used to identify significant VAF changes, by comparing each
baseline sample with each surgical sample. Those with Po0.05 were retained.
Baseline-specific variants were required to be below 10% VAF in the surgical sample
and have at least one variant-supporting read in the baseline RNA sample.
Surgical-specific variants were required to be below 10% VAF in the baseline sample
and have at least one variant-supporting read in the surgical RNA sample.
Targeted sequencing of extension cohort. A panel of 83 breast cancer-related
genes was derived from meta-analysis and literature review (Supplementary
Data 11). These genes were targeted comprehensively with 3,029 complementary
probes for hybridization-based enrichment (IDT Technologies), then sequenced on
the Illumina HiSeq platform. These captured data were produced for baseline and
surgical samples from 19 of the 22 WGS cases, and for an additional 38 cases. SNVs
and Indels were called as described in the Supplementary Methods.
RNA library preparation and sequencing. RNA preparation was performed
according to the Illumina TruSeq mRNA protocol with Poly-A selection.
Unstranded paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000
platform, producing 48 � 7 � 48 paired-end reads.
Expression profiling. RNA-seq data were aligned with Tophat v2.0.8
(de novo mode, reference only, reference guided) and expression levels calculated
with Cufflinks v2.1.1 (params: --max-bundle-length ¼ 10,000,000). RNAseq read-
counts for all coding mutations were calculated using bam-readcount 0.7
(https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount). The samples were clustered by
applying unsupervised hierarchical clustering on a matrix of sample-by-sample
correlations derived from gene expression (FPKM) values (Supplementary
Data 7 and 8).
Clonality and clonal instability. The clonal architecture of each tumour was
inferred with sciClone (version 1.0.7; ref. 22), using default parameters except for
copyNumberMargins set to 0.25. The median VAF of each subclone was used as
input for clonevol (https://github.com/hdng/clonevol), which constructed
evolutionary trees and estimated the absolute percentage of each clone in each
sample. The clonal instability index was calculated as the mean of absolute
differences between pre and post clonevol-inferred clonal percentages. A value of 0
represents no change, and 1 represents completely distinct tumours. In this study,
0.1 was used as an arbitrary cutoff between ‘stable’ and ‘dynamic’ tumours. BRC17
and BRC48 had complex patterns of copy number and ploidy changes preventing
automated clonal inference, but clearly fall into this classification, with mutations
specific to both baseline and surgical tumours. BRC18 did not have clear separation
between subclonal populations, but contained a large number of mutations that
were present in roughly half of the baseline sample tumour cells and were
significantly enriched (and mostly expressed) in the surgical sample tumour cells.
Links to all the data and scripts used for clonal inference are found in
Supplementary Software 1.
Code availability. Code used for analyses is all open source and detailed versions
and parameters are provided above.
Data availability. The baseline whole-genome sequences have already been
reported20 and deposited in dbGaP with accession ID phs000472. Both the RNA
sequencing data and the genomic sequencing data from the post-treatment samples
and extension cohort have been added to the same study. All other data are
contained within the Article or Supplementary Information files, or available from
the authors upon request.
