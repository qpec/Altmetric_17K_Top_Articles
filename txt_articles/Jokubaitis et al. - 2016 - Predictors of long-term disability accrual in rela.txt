Abstract  
Objective: To identify predictors of ten year expanded disability status scale (EDSS) change after 
treatment initiation in patients with relapse-onset MS. 
Methods:  Using data obtained from MSBase, we defined baseline as the date of first injectable 
therapy initiation.  Patients need only have remained on injectable therapy for one day and were 
monitored on any approved disease modifying therapy, or no therapy thereafter.  Median EDSS 
score changes over a 10-year period were determined.  Predictors of EDSS change were then 
assessed using median quantile regression analysis.  Sensitivity analyses were further performed. 
Results: We identified 2,466 patients followed up for at least 10 years reporting post-baseline 
disability scores.  Patients were treated an average 83% of their follow-up time.  EDSS scores 
increased by a median 1 point (interquartile range 0-2) at 10 years post-baseline.  Annualised 
relapse rate was highly predictive of increases in median EDSS over 10 years (coeff 1.14, p=1.9x10-
22).  On therapy relapses carried greater burden than off therapy relapses.  Cumulative treatment 
exposure was independently associated with lower EDSS at 10 years (coeff -0.86, p=1.3x10-9).  
Furthermore, pregnancies were also independently associated with lower EDSS scores over the 10 
year observation period (coeff -0.36, p=0.009). 
Interpretation: We provide evidence of long-term treatment benefit in a large registry cohort, and 
provide evidence of long-term protective effects of pregnancy against disability accrual.  We 
demonstrate that high-annualised relapse rate, particularly on-treatment relapse, is an indicator of 
poor prognosis.

Introduction 
Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young 
adults globally. 1  It is a chronic degenerative illness, usually diagnosed in the third decade of 
life, and therefore carries a high economic and quality of life burden associated with it. 2-6  
One of the principal objectives in the care of people with multiple sclerosis is, therefore, to 
reduce the irreversible accumulation of neurological disability. 
 
Clinical trials provide evidence for clinical efficacy of disease modifying therapies (DMT) in 
reducing short-term disease burden, 7-10 however, clinical trials occur within well-controlled 
environments, with rigorous patient review, and therefore do not necessarily reflect real-
world patient characteristics or behaviours.  Importantly, the duration of follow-up is too 
short to assess persistent disability outcomes with certainty. Long-term treatment 
effectiveness in reducing disability accumulation remains controversial, because data from 
some observational studies provide evidence for short to medium-term treatment efficacy, 
11-13 whilst others show that treated patients derive no benefit over and above untreated 
patients. 14, 15  One possible confounder is that long-term untreated patients represent an 
intrinsically benign group of patients, so that comparisons of treated versus untreated 
patients suffer from indication bias. 
 
We sought to remove indication bias for evaluation of treatment effects by retrospectively 
defining the baseline of a large, prospectively followed cohort in the MSBase observational 
study as the time of first commencement of immune-modulatory therapy.

Our aim was to identify demographic, clinical and treatment exposure predictors of long-
term disability accrual, as assessed by expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score change 
over 10 years in a real-world MS registry cohort. 
 
Patients and Methods 
Ethics statement 
The MSBase Registry (registered with WHO ICTRP, ID ACTRN12605000455662) was 
approved by the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee and by the local 
ethics committees in all participating centres (or exemptions granted, according to 
applicable local laws and regulations).  Written informed consent was obtained from all 
enrolled patients participating in the registry in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 
Study population 
Data were extracted from the global MSBase Registry.  Extracted data were recorded as part 
of routine clinical practice according to the MSBase observational protocol.16  The MSBase 
protocol mandates minimum annual updates, where data entry is performed in real-time or 
near real-time at most participating centres.  
Patients with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis prescribed Interferon-β (IFNβ) or Glatiramer 
Acetate (GA) as a first DMT exposure were included in this study.  Patients must have had an 
EDSS score recorded at baseline, defined as an EDSS score recorded within +/- 12 months of 
first IFNβ/GA initiation.  Additionally, study inclusion criteria required at least one EDSS 
score to be recorded within +/- 12 months of the 10-year post-treatment initiation time-
point.  All analysed EDSS scores must have been recorded in the absence of a concurrent 
relapse, defined as occurrence of new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms

persisting for >24 hours, in the absence of concurrent illness or fever. EDSS scores recorded 
within 30 days of relapse onset were excluded from this analysis to eschew artificial 
inflation of median EDSS score changes over time. 
Patients classified as having secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) at first IFNβ/GA 
treatment initiation, or those with incomplete datasets were further excluded.  The 
minimum dataset required for study inclusion comprised: date of birth, sex, clinic location, 
date of disease onset, clinical course, follow-up visit dates, EDSS scores recorded at visits, 
dates of all relapses, start and end dates of all DMT commencements and DMT identity. 
Here we identified a phenotypically diverse patient population.  All patients were included 
provided they met the above inclusion criteria and minimum dataset requirements. 
Data relating to reported pregnancies was also included.  Available pregnancy data included: 
confirmed conception date, termination date, birthdate, and number of live births.   
Included patients commenced immunotherapy between January 1989 - August 2006. 
 
Definitions 
Ten year EDSS score change was defined as the difference between the baseline EDSS score, 
and EDSS scores recorded at 10 years post-baseline.  To ensure standardised EDSS scoring 
and to reduce inter-rater variability, MSBase mandates at all participating neurologists have 
Neurostatus certification. 
Annualised relapse rate (ARR) is defined as the number of relapses that occur per year of 
observation.

Analysis was undertaken using Stata version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) or R 
(http://R-project.org).  All analyses were two-tailed and p<0.05 was considered significant.  
Continuous variables were assessed for normality (Shapiro-Wilk normality test) and 
described using mean and standard deviation, or summarised using median and inter-
quartile range as appropriate.  Categorical variables were summarised using frequencies.  
Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to assess median treatment persistence, as one third of 
the cohort had not yet discontinued their first treatment commencement. 
Predictors of 10 year EDSS change were assessed using unadjusted and adjusted quantile 
median regression.  The EDSS change demonstrated significant departures form normality 
and was resistant to common transformations.  Quantile median regression was preferred 
over simple linear regression of the mean to model the influence of baseline demographics, 
clinic location, within-interval IFNβ/GA treatment exposures, DMT identity, pregnancy 
events, baseline EDSS score and relapse activity on 10-year EDSS change. Co-linearity and 
interactions between model covariates were examined using a likelihood ratio test.  The He 
& Zhu Lack-Of-Fit test for Quantile Regression17 was used to assess goodness of fit for each 
model. Competing quantile median regression models were compared, and the most 
parsimonious model was selected based on smallest model residuals. 
A series of analyses were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the study to inclusion 
criteria, and to differences in variable definitions.  Sensitivity to inclusion criteria was tested 
by: comparing 10 year EDSS outcomes in a cohort in which EDSS scores must have been 
recorded within +/- 6 months of baseline and follow-up; comparing outcomes only in those 
patients with confirmed EDSS scores reported 3-15 months after the 10 year follow-up visit; 
and comparing 10 year EDSS outcomes only in those patients with no change or clinically 
significant changes according to a 3-step EDSS progression/regression paradigm (i.e. a

minimum 1.5 point EDSS score increase above a baseline score of 0, a minimum 1 point 
EDSS score increase/decrease if baseline EDSS score is between 1-5.5, and a minimum 0.5 
point EDSS score increase/decrease if baseline EDSS score was 6 or above).18  Sensitivity to 
the definition of variables was tested by:  substituting cumulative treatment exposure on all 
disease modifying therapies (including IFNβ/GA, teriflunomide, fingolimod, dimethyl 
fumarate, cladribine, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, alemtuzumab, autologous stem cell 
transplantation, rituximab, ocrelizumab) for cumulative exposure to IFNβ/GA; by 
substituting cumulative proportion of observation period spent pregnant for number of 
term-pregnancies, thereby incorporating all pregnancies, including those that were 
terminated early; by substituting latitude for country; and by substituting ARR disaggregated 
by 5-year intervals for overall ARR into the primary adjusted model to assess the timing of 
relapses on EDSS outcomes. 
To assess the impact of on-treatment relapses on EDSS outcomes, two additional adjusted 
quantile median regression models were run.  In the first sub-analysis, ARR was substituted 
with on and off-treatment calculated ARR for the 10-year follow-up period (S1).  In the 
second sub-analysis, only those patients who were able to contribute to both on-treatment 
and off-treatment epochs were modelled (S2).  Both models were adjusted for all model 
covariates included in the primary adjusted analysis. 
In all analyses patient follow-up was censored at the date of the ten-year EDSS visit, unless 
stated otherwise.

Patient characteristics 
16,134 registry patients from 97 clinics across 27 countries recording IFNβ or GA as first 
DMT were followed up for a median 6.7 years (IQR: 3.5, 10.8).  Of these, 2,466 (15.3%) 
patients met the study inclusion criteria (Figure 1), that is, they were followed up for at least 
10 years, recorded a 10-year post-baseline EDSS score, and met minimum dataset 
requirements. 2,302 (93.3%) of patients included in the analysis were followed-up in clinics 
within Italy, Canada, the Czech Republic, Spain, Australia or Belgium (Supplementary Table 
1).  The baseline and follow-up characteristics of these cohorts are described in detail in 
Table 1 and Figure 2.  Baseline characteristics of the 13,668 excluded patients 
(Supplementary Table 2) were largely comparable to the included cohort with the exception 
that a greater number of patients were first treated with a CIS diagnosis, and had a shorter 
duration between symptom onset and therapy initiation. 
The mean annualised relapse rate (ARR) was 0.36 (SD 0.33) over the 10-year follow-up 
period. 
A total of 304 full-term pregnancies were reported for 226 (12.3%) females over the 10-year 
observation period, of which 134 (44.1%) were conceived on therapy.  128 (42.1%) 
pregnancies occurred in the first five years of follow-up post-baseline. 
 
Disease-modifying therapy 
Of the 16,134 patients who initiated IFNβ/GA therapy, 9,425 (58.4%) patients discontinued 
treatment during the observation period after a median 4.30 years (IQR 1.83, 8.90 years). 
Mean proportion of time on first IFNβ/GA therapy for the entire 16,134 patient cohort was 
0.61 (SD 0.44). Mean proportion of time on first IFNβ/GA therapy was 0.59 (SD 0.36) for the 
2,466 patient cohort with 10-year follow-up.  Mean cumulative exposure to any IFNβ/GA

13
initiation over the 10-year follow-up period was 0.79 (SD 0.27), indicating high intra-class 
switching.  Mean proportion of follow-up on oral therapies (including fingolimod, dimethyl 
fumarate, teriflunomide and cladribine) during this period was 0.01 (SD 0.06); and mean 
proportion of follow-up on high efficacy therapies (principally natalizumab and 
mitoxantrone, but also encompassing alemtuzumab, autologous stem cell transplantation, 
rituximab, and ocrelizumab) was 0.03 (SD 0.10).  1,183 switches of therapy were reported 
for 932 (37.8%) patients.  Median treatment gap was 36 days (IQR: 0, 286) for all switches.  
Mean proportion of follow-up spent untreated was 0.19 (SD 0.26) over 10 years.  
 
Long-term EDSS score changes and their predictors 
Median EDSS point increase at 10 years post-baseline was 1.0 (interquartile range (IQR): 
0,2).  We identified 839 (34%) individuals who improved or remained stable relative to 
baseline over the 10-year observation period. Table 2 summarises the proportion of 
patients reaching hard EDSS milestones at 10 years follow-up post-baseline. 
Predictors of greater EDSS increase 10 years after initiating first INFβ/GA on adjusted 
quantile regression modelling included older age at onset, longer disease duration at 
baseline and higher annualised relapse rate (ARR) (Table 3). Higher cumulative treatment 
exposure to IFNβ/GA therapy was associated with reduced EDSS scores across the 10-year 
interval (coeff -0.86; 95% CI -1.13, -0.58; p=1.3x10-9), translating into a prevention of 1 EDSS 
point increase for every 11.6-years of INFβ/GA exposure.  First-line DMT choice was not 
significantly associated with long-term outcomes (p>0.05 for all comparisons, data not 
shown).  In addition at least one pregnancy during the 10-year post-baseline period was 
associated with a median 0.36-point decrease in EDSS (95% CI: -0.62, -0.09).

Sensitivity Analyses 
EDSS outcome measure 
Sensitivity analyses evaluating the robustness of results based on inclusion criteria (Table 4) 
largely supported the primary analysis.  All results of the primary analysis were replicated 
when either restricting inclusion criteria to only include patients whose EDSS scores were 
reported within +/- 6 months of baseline and 10-year follow-up, or to those patients whose 
10-year EDSS scores were confirmed 3-15 months after the 10-year assessment. 
Assessment of long-term outcomes in individuals who reported either no change in EDSS 
score, or a clinically significant change in EDSS score according to a 3-step EDSS 
progression/regression paradigm (n=1,984) additionally found that male sex was predictive 
of a median 0.26-point higher EDSS score at 10 years post-baseline relative to females 
(p=0.015; Table 4).  Here, again, ARR was the primary driver of disability accumulation, 
where an ARR of 1 resulted in a median 1.26-point increase in EDSS score over the 10-year 
observation period.  
 
Annualised relapse rate 
Given that ARR was the strongest independent clinical predictor of long-term outcome, we 
further sought to determine the impact of the timing of these relapses.  We disaggregated 
relapses by those that occurred within the first 5 years of follow-up, and those that occurred 
thereafter.  We found on adjusted analysis, that an ARR of one in the first 5 years of 
observation was associated with in a median 0.62-point EDSS score increase at 10-years 
(95% CI: 0.44, 0.79; p=5.3x10-12). Similarly, an ARR of one between years 5-10 was 
associated with a median 0.50-point EDSS score increase at 10 years (95% CI: 0.28, 0.72; 
p=1.3x10-5).

The effect of on and off-treatment relapses on 10-year EDSS change was assessed in two 
further sensitivity analyses.  Of the 2,466 patients analysed in this study, 1,968 (79.8%) 
reported at least one on-treatment relapse, and 665 (27%) patients reported at least one 
off-treatment relapse.  An on-treatment ARR of 1.0 was associated with a 0.86-point EDSS 
score increase (p=6.5x10-19) over 10 years (equivalently, an on-treatment ARR of 0.3 was 
associated with a 0.26-point increase in EDSS over the 10-year period; Figure 3- S1).  
Whereas, an off-treatment ARR of 1 was associated with a 0.05-point EDSS score increase 
(p>0.05).  A second sub-analysis (S2) using only those patients who contributed to both on 
and off-treatment epochs (n = 1,475) confirmed much weaker off-treatment relapse 
(p>0.05) than on-treatment relapse (p=2.4x10-6) effects (Figure 3). 
 
To further assess the impact of relapses on long-term EDSS outcomes we identified those 
relapses for which categorical recovery data (complete, partial, none) were available.  
Recovery data were reported for 21% of all relapses that occurred during the 10-year 
follow-up period, corresponding to 33.7% of individuals in our cohort.  When these data 
were disaggregated by clinically significant (3-step) EDSS changes, we found that a greater 
proportion of relapses failed to resolve (no or partial recovery) in those cases with clinically 
significant EDSS increases (58.1%), relative to those who remained stable (34.4%) or those 
whose EDSS scores significantly regressed (34.3%). 
 
Therapeutic intervention 
Due to the very limited exposure of patients in this cohort to non-IFNβ/GA therapies (overall 
1% for oral therapy, and 3% for high efficacy therapies, as compared to 79% for injectable

16
therapies), there was insufficient statistical power to disaggregate treatment effects by 
treatment class.  However, an additional adjusted sensitivity analysis, combining all DMT 
again confirmed the protective effect of DMT against disability accrual (coeff -0.87; 
p=5.7x10-9; Table 5). 
We further sought to interrogate the effect of pregnancy on long-term outcomes by 
modelling cumulative time spent pregnant over the observation period.  We included all 
reported pregnancies, whether successfully delivered, or prematurely terminated.  Here we 
found that pregnancy was associated with a median 3.17-point lower EDSS score over 10 
years (equivalently -0.32-points per 10% of time pregnant).  Whereas, comparable exposure 
to INFβ/GA therapy was associated with a median 0.71-point (or -0.07-points per 10% of 
observation on therapy) lower EDSS score in the same context (Table 5). 
An additional adjusted sensitivity analysis substituting latitude for country failed to 
demonstrate an independent relationship between latitude (coeff per 10 degrees of latitude 
-0.002; 95% CI -0.16, 0.15; p=0.977) and EDSS outcome (rest of model not shown). 
 
Discussion 
Our aim was to determine predictors of EDSS score change, including treatment effects, in a 
large, real-world, prospectively acquired cohort of multiple sclerosis patients who 
commenced injectable disease modifying therapy.  We found that EDSS score increases in 
this cohort were generally modest over the 10-year observation period, consistent with 
long-term extension arms of pivotal trials.19, 20  High relapse activity was the principal driver 
of 10-year post-baseline disability increase, with a smaller but equally significant effect of 
older age, and longer delay to treatment initiation.  Cumulative treatment exposure to first-
line DMTs was independently associated with decreased disability accrual in all models, with

17
11.6 years of exposure to INFβ/GA therapy required to prevent 1 EDSS point increase.  
Additionally, we found that the therapeutic effect of pregnancy was more than four-times 
greater than that of first-line therapy in women within the first 10 years of DMT start.  
 
The impact of relapses on long-term disability outcomes is still debated.  Past studies have 
interrogated the effect of relapses on time to reach hard disability milestones, finding that 
very high relapse rates in the first 5 years of disease onset are associated with a more rapid 
progression to hard EDSS milestones, at least in the short-term.21, 22  These studies have 
further argued that late relapses, particularly those in the progressive stages of the disease, 
have little or no influence on disability progression.22, 23  In contrast, we demonstrated a 
stronger relationship between relapses and EDSS score changes over time, consistent with 
other studies.24-26  We have demonstrated that the effect of relapses on disability accrual in 
a modern-day, treated cohort of multiple sclerosis patients is profound, even for those 
relapses occurring some 14 or more years after disease onset.  This held true, even when 
adjusting for baseline EDSS score, treatment effects and pregnancy.  However, in 
concordance with past studies,21, 22 we did find that those relapses occurring earlier in the 
disease course had the greatest impact on long-term disability outcomes. 
 
The 8-year follow-up of the IFNβ-1a IM MSCRG trial9 demonstrated that two or more 
relapses in the first 2 years on treatment were predictive of disability score in the long-term.  
However, this effect lost significance in adjusted modelling, most likely due to the relatively 
small cohort size of 160 participants.27  The 15-year follow-up (ASSURANCE study) of this 
same pivotal trial, however, demonstrated that on-treatment relapses during the first two 
years of the MSCRG trial were correlated with severe EDSS worsening at 15 years.28  We

sought to confirm this observation and assessed the effect of on-treatment and off-
treatment relapses on disability outcomes in a series of sensitivity analyses.  We 
demonstrated that on-treatment relapses did indeed have an independent and profound 
effect on 10-year EDSS score increases.  We further found that the effect of off-treatment 
relapses on long-term outcomes was marginal.  This result suggests that persistent relapse 
activity on first-line therapy is prognostic of future outcome, consistent with the modified 
Rio score.29  Whilst limited relapse recovery data were available for this cohort, they 
nonetheless demonstrated that one of the key mechanisms driving disability accrual is the 
predisposition towards poor relapse recovery, consistent with prior studies.26, 30  In an era 
where numerous new therapeutic agents are available for the treatment of relapsing 
multiple sclerosis, and where treatment goals have shifted towards freedom from disease 
activity,31, 32 this result supports treatment escalation particularly in those patients relapsing 
on first-line therapy to mitigate permanent disability accrual.33, 34 
 
It has been demonstrated in a meta-analysis of 19 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
randomised controlled trials, that efficacy of treatment in reducing the incidence of relapses 
is additionally correlated with decreases in short-term disability.25  Similarly, data from 
observational cohort studies have shown that length of first-line treatment exposure 
significantly reduces the risk of disability progression in the short-term, particularly if used 
early in the disease course.12, 13  Our data are consistent with and extend these studies, 
demonstrating that the influence of relapses and treatment exposure in RRMS extends to 
long-term disability changes, not just those in the acute phase.  In contrast to past 
reports,14, 15 here we show that increasing cumulative treatment exposure over the 
observation period independently predicts better disability outcomes in the long-term.  Our

results are consistent with the extension phases of a number of pivotal RCTs, demonstrating 
those patients exposed to treatment for longer periods have better long-term EDSS 
outcomes.19, 20, 35-39  It is of course possible that we have identified treatment responders, 
whereas those who spent little time on therapy were poor responders with more aggressive 
disease.  However, these results still provide confidence in the long-term effectiveness of 
first-line therapy in these patients.   
 
It is now well established that relapse rates diminish during pregnancy, with relapse activity 
being lowest in the third trimester, and rebounding in the first 3 months post-partum.40, 41  
Women with high disease activity prior to pregnancy are at greatest risk of post-partum 
disease activity.41, 42  However, the long-term effect of pregnancy on the accumulation of 
disability is less well understood with studies reporting either: acceleration to SPMS,43 no 
effect of pregnancy on long-term outcomes,44 longer time to wheelchair or progressive 
phase in women with at least one pregnancy compared to nulliparous women45, 46, or a 
reduced risk of reaching an EDSS 6 milestone only in those women with two or more 
pregnancies.47 Here, we were able to examine the effect of pregnancy on long-term 
outcomes whilst adjusting for relapse rates, therapy use and other relevant covariates. We 
found that having at least one pregnancy within the first 10 years of first DMT initiation had 
a protective effect against the accumulation of disability, independent of relapse activity 
(including post-partum relapse activity spikes) and therapy use.  Interestingly, when 
comparing proportion of time spent pregnant (irrespective of pregnancy outcome) to 
proportion of time on first-line therapy, we found that the therapeutic effect of pregnancy 
was much larger than that of therapy, thus demonstrating that pregnancy is largely 
beneficial in women with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis.  It is conceivable that women

with lower disease burden are those more likely to attempt pregnancy.  However, in our 
study, approximately half of the pregnancies were conceived whilst on therapy, suggesting 
that a large proportion of pregnancy decisions were not based solely on disease burden 
considerations. 
 
The data analysed here were collected as part of a multinational cohort study, primarily in 
large tertiary referral centres.  Further, a number of patients who initiated first-line therapy 
were excluded from this study as they did not meet inclusion criteria (length of follow-up, or 
availability of EDSS scores) and therefore this study is subject to selection bias.  However, 
we utilised an agreed minimum dataset to ensure consistency of collected data. Further, we 
demonstrated that excluded patients were largely comparable to our included cohort at 
baseline, with the exception that patients more recently diagnosed tend to access 
treatment sooner.  Whilst other factors such as socioeconomic status, vitamin D levels may 
also influence outcomes, these data were not available for analysis.  We did, however, 
adjust for clinic country in all models to account for both differences in healthcare systems 
and prescribing practices.  Further a sensitivity analysis adjusting for latitude found no 
association with EDSS outcomes.   
An additional limitation of our study is intrinsic in the use of the EDSS, which is weighted 
towards motor symptoms and subject to inter and intra-rater variability.  To mitigate 
against this, we required that all investigators have Neurostatus certification.  Further, the 
exclusion of EDSS scores recorded within 30 days of a relapse helped to mitigate against 
over-inflated scores driving sharp increases or decreases in observed long-term disability 
changes.   Our analysis being conducted retrospectively on a prospectively acquired dataset

was free from reporting bias.  Further, we removed indication bias from this study by 
defining use of first injectable therapy as the baseline for this analysis.   
 
Conclusions 
In a large contemporary, real-world cohort, we provide evidence of a strong protective 
effect of disease modifying therapy against long-term disability accrual, particularly if used 
early in the disease course.  We also demonstrate a potent therapeutic effect of pregnancy.  
Further, we demonstrate a direct relationship between inflammation and the accumulation 
of long-term disability.  Our results demonstrate that high relapse activity, particularly early 
on-treatment relapse activity, is an indicator of poor prognosis. Together, these results 
provide evidence and confidence in the long-term benefits of disease-modifying therapy 
and pregnancy in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, but further 
argue for treatment escalation in those patients relapsing on first-line therapy to protect 
against long-term disability accrual.

baseline, disease duration, proportion of follow-up on first-line DMT, pregnancies, first DMT 
identity, baseline EDSS score and clinic country.  Sub-analysis 1 (S1) includes all 2,466 
patients from the primary analysis.  Sub-analysis 2 (S2) only models those patients who 
were able to contribute to both on-treatment and off-treatment epochs (n=1,475). This

increases, whereas off-treatment relapses have a marginal effect on disability outcomes.

Figure shows change in EDSS score post-baseline at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10-years (A).  Figure further shows the 
number of patients receiving disease-modifying therapy at baseline (BL) and during each year of follow-up 
thereafter (B).  Disease-modifying therapies included: all IFNβ preparations, glatiramer acetate, 
natalizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, cladribine, alemtuzumab and rituximab, 
ocrelizumab, ASCT, mitoxantrone and autologous stem cell transplantation.

Contribution of on and off-therapy annualised relapse rate (ARR) to 10-year median EDSS changes (95% 
CI).  Here the ARR is normalised to 1.  This figure shows the results of two adjusted quantile median 
regression analyses.  All analyses were adjusted for gender, age at baseline, disease duration, proportion of 
follow-up on first-line DMT, pregnancies, first DMT identity, baseline EDSS score and clinic country.  Sub-
analysis 1 (S1) includes all 2,466 patients from the primary analysis.  Sub-analysis 2 (S2) only models those 
patients who were able to contribute to both on-treatment and off-treatment epochs (n=1,475). This figure 
demonstrates that on-treatment relapses have a profound effect on long-term EDSS increases, whereas off-
treatment relapses have a marginal effect on disability outcomes.
