Patterns and Trends in Age-Specific Black-White Differences in 
Breast Cancer Incidence and Mortality – United States, 1999–2014

Breast cancer continues to be the most commonly diagnosed 
cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among 
U.S. women (1). Compared with white women, black women 
historically have had lower rates of breast cancer incidence and, 
beginning in the 1980s, higher death rates (1). This report 
examines age-specific black-white disparities in breast cancer 
incidence during 1999–2013 and mortality during 2000–2014 
in the United States using data from United States Cancer 
Statistics (USCS) (2). Overall rates of breast cancer incidence 
were similar, but death rates remained higher for black women 
compared with white women. During 1999–2013, breast 
cancer incidence decreased among white women but increased 
slightly among black women resulting in a similar average 
incidence at the end of the period. Breast cancer incidence 
trends differed by race and age, particularly from 1999 to 
2004–2005, when rates decreased only among white women 
aged ≥50 years. Breast cancer death rates decreased significantly 
during 2000–2014, regardless of age with patterns varying 
by race. For women aged ≥50 years, death rates declined sig-
nificantly faster among white women compared with black 
women; among women aged <50 years, breast cancer death 
rates decreased at the same rate among black and white women. 
Although some of molecular factors that lead to more aggressive 
breast cancer are known, a fuller understanding of the exact 
mechanisms might lead to more tailored interventions that 
could decrease mortality disparities. When combined with 
population-based approaches to increase knowledge of family 
history of cancer, increase physical activity, promote a healthy 
diet to maintain a healthy bodyweight, and increase screening 
for breast cancer, targeted treatment interventions could reduce 
racial disparities in breast cancer.

and 92% during 1999–2013.† SEER Summary Stage 2000§ 
was used to characterize cancers as localized, regional, distant, 
or unknown stage using clinical and pathologic tumor charac-
teristics, such as tumor size, depth of invasion and extension 
to regional or distant tissues, involvement of regional lymph 
nodes, and distant metastases. Breast cancer death data dur-
ing 2000–2014 were based on death certificate information 
reported to state vital statistics offices and compiled into a 
national file through the National Vital Statistics System; mor-
tality data in this report cover 100% of the U.S. population. 
Race and ethnicity were abstracted from medical records for 
cases and from death certificates for deaths; this report includes 
all races, white, and black, regardless of ethnicity. Population 
estimates for the denominators of incidence and death rates 
were from the U.S. Census, as modified by the National 
Cancer Institute. Five-year average annual incidence rates 
for 2009–2013 and death rates for 2010–2014 per 100,000 
women were age-adjusted by the direct method to the 2000 
U.S. standard population (19 age groups).¶ Average annual 
percentage change was used to quantify changes in incidence 
rates during 1999–2013 and death rates during 2000–2014 
and was calculated using joinpoint regression, which allowed 
different slopes for three periods; the year at which slopes 
changed could vary by race and age.
During 2009–2013, approximately 221,000 breast can-
cers were diagnosed each year (Table). Overall incidence of 
breast cancer was similar among black women (121.5 cases 
per 100,000 population) and white women (123.6 cases per 
100,000 population), but differences by age and stage were 
found. Compared with white women, breast cancer incidence 
was higher among black women aged <60 years, but lower 
among black women aged ≥60 years. Black women had a 
lower percentage of breast cancers diagnosed at a localized 
stage (54%) than did white women (64%) (Table). Among 
white women, breast cancer incidence decreased from 1999 
to 2004, and then stabilized, decreasing 0.8% per year on 
average; however, breast cancer incidence was stable from 
1999 to 2005 among black women and then nonsignificantly 
† Cancer registries demonstrated that cancer incidence data were of high quality 
by meeting the six USCS publication criteria: 1) case ascertainment ≥90% 
complete; 2) ≤5% of cases ascertained solely on the basis of death certificate; 
3) ≤3% of cases missing information on sex; 4) ≤3% of cases missing information 
on age; 5) ≤5% of cases missing information on race; and 6) ≥97% of registry’s 
records passed a set of single-field and inter-field computerized edits that test 
the validity and logic of data components. Additional information available at

increased (Figure 1). Breast cancer incidence trends differed 
by race and age, particularly during 1999–2004 when rates 
decreased only among white women aged ≥50 years. During 
1999–2013, among women aged 60–79 years, rates of breast 
cancer incidence decreased significantly among white women, 
but increased significantly among black women (https://www.
cdc.gov/cancer/breast/statistics/trends_invasive.htm).
During 2010–2014, approximately 41,000 deaths from 
breast cancer occurred each year (Table). Breast cancer mor-
tality was 41% higher among black women (29.2 deaths per 
100,000 population) than white women (20.6 deaths per 
100,000 population). Breast cancer death rates decreased 
during 2010–2014 among both blacks and whites, although 
differences in trends by race and age were found (Figure 2). 
Overall, breast cancer death rates decreased faster among 
white women (-1.9% per year) compared with black women 
(-1.5% per year). Among women aged <50 years, breast cancer 
death rates decreased at the same pace among black and white 
women, whereas white women aged ≥50 years had significantly 
larger decreases. The largest difference by race was observed 
among women aged 60–69 years: breast cancer death rates 
decreased 2.0% per year among white women compared with 
1.0% among black women.
Discussion
Recent trends in breast cancer incidence suggest that the con-
vergence and now equal incidence for black and white women 
has been primarily because of incidence increasing among 
black women, particularly among those aged 60–79 years, and 
concomitant decreasing or stable rates in white women. Breast 
cancer mortality is approximately 40% higher among black 
women compared with white women, with faster decreases in 
mortality among white women. This report confirms previous 
findings by race overall (1), and presents age-specific changes 
for incidence and mortality by race.
A previous CDC report suggested that improvements in 
follow-up of abnormal screening tests and treatment for breast 
cancer for black women could address racial disparities (3).

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Several recent large-scale federal initiatives have provided a 
novel opportunity to address racial disparities in breast can-
cer subtypes and beyond at the molecular level. Advances in 
understanding breast cancer subtypes have improved awareness 
that black women are more likely to be diagnosed with triple 
negative breast cancer (negative estrogen receptor, progesterone 
receptor, and HER2 status), which might have improved the 
likelihood that they receive the appropriate treatment based 
on their cancer type (4). The Precision Medicine Initiative** 
promotes advances in research, technology, and policies to 
enable researchers, providers and patients to work together 
to develop individualized care by understanding how the 
molecular characteristics of cancers lead to phenotypic charac-
teristics noted in the clinical setting. The Cancer Moonshot†† 
is focused on addressing the most pressing needs for cancer 
control, including accelerating the understanding of cancer 
and its prevention, early detection, treatment, and cure. Both 
initiatives are focused on determining the genetic variations 
that increase risk for aggressive breast cancer so that tailored 
interventions and treatment plans can be developed.
Long-term breast cancer incidence trends for black women 
indicate steady increases over the past 40 years, resulting in 
incidence rates equivalent to those among white women in 
2013 (5). In-depth analyses by age, race, and period of diag-
nosis indicate that the largest increases are seen among black 
women aged 60–79 years. The reason for this temporal trend 
in black women is not well understood. The increasing breast 
cancer incidence suggests there might be a screening effect 
from increased use of mammography (6). Previous increasing 
trends in obesity prevalence among black women might also 
play a role (7). The exact biologic mechanisms for the associa-
tion between obesity and increased risk for breast cancer are 
still unknown (7). These increasing trends might stabilize and 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Despite improvements in early detection and treatment for 
breast cancer, black women continue to have the highest breast 
cancer mortality rate. Since 1975, black women have had lower 
breast cancer incidence compared to white women, but rates 
have recently converged, in part because of increasing breast 
cancer incidence in black women.
What is added by this report?
In-depth analyses of population-based data indicated that 
breast cancer incidence is equal for black and white women in 
part because of incidence increasing among black women, 
particularly among those aged 60–79 years. Breast cancer 
mortality continues to be higher among black women com-
pared with white women, with death rates decreasing faster 
among white women. However, among women aged <50 years, 
breast cancer death rates are decreasing at the same rate 
among black and white women.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Measures to ensure access to quality care and the best-available 
treatments for all women diagnosed with breast cancer can 
help address these racial disparities. Increasing trends in obesity 
prevalence among black women could be contributing to 
increasing incidence of breast cancer. Thus, increasing and 
sustaining public health interventions to increase physical 
activity and promote a healthy diet to reach and maintain a 
healthy weight throughout a woman’s life need to be consid-
ered. As tailored interventions and therapies are developed and 
implemented, public health professionals can use population-
based incidence and mortality data to monitor their impact on 
health disparities.

decline by sustaining and increasing public health interventions 
to increase physical activity and promote a healthy diet to reach 
and maintain a healthy weight throughout a woman’s life (7). 
Much of the decrease in breast cancer incidence among white 
women is believed to be because of decreased use of postmeno-
pausal hormone replacement therapy based on findings from 
the Women’s Health Initiative (1).
This report illustrates that the disparity in breast cancer 
mortality is stable, with comparable declines in death rates 
among younger black and white women. Previous studies 
have indicated that similar use of mammography screening 
among black and white women has led to more cancers being 
diagnosed at an early stage, and more appropriate treatment of 
aggressive cancers in young black women (4,8). At the popu-
lation level, some communities have demonstrated success in 
achieving equity for black women dying from breast cancer; 
these successes provide opportunities to learn about pathways 
for improved outcomes (9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limi-

Abbreviation: AAPC = average annual percentage change.
* AAPC was calculated using joinpoint regression, which allowed different slopes for three periods; the year at which slopes changed could vary by age and race. All 
AAPCs were significantly different (p<0.05) than zero. 
† Trends among black women were significantly different (p<0.05) than among white women for the following age groups: all ages, 50–59 years, 60–69 years, and 
79–79 years.
to misclassification; however, misclassification is minimal for 
black and white race (10). Second, the most recent data are 
several years old, because current requirements for reporting 
cancer registry data are rigorous and require multiple steps. 
Finally, cancer registries do not routinely collect risk factor 
information that could inform the trends noted here.
Breast cancer mortality is decreasing for both black and 
white women, with equal pace of decrease for younger black 
and white women. Continued decreases involve accelerating 
current progress and understanding breast cancer genomics for 
predicting risk and promoting effective treatment through new 
initiatives like the Precision Medicine Initiative and Cancer 
Moonshot. Public health professionals need to work in tandem 
with scientists and clinical researchers to monitor the successes 
of these newly developed therapies by assessing disparities at 
a population level using trends in incidence and death rates.
