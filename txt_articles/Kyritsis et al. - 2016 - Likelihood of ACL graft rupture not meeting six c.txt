ABSTRACT
Background The decision as to whether or not an
athlete is ready to return to sport (RTS) after ACL
reconstruction is difficult as the commonly used RTS
criteria have not been validated.
Purpose To evaluate whether a set of objective
discharge criteria, including muscle strength and
functional tests, are associated with risk of ACL graft
rupture after RTS.
Materials and methods 158 male professional
athletes who underwent an ACL reconstruction and
returned to their previous professional level of sport were
included. Before players returned to sport they
underwent a battery of discharge tests (isokinetic
strength testing at 60°, 180° and 300°/s, a running
t test, single hop, triple hop and triple crossover hop
tests). Athletes were monitored for ACL re-ruptures once
they returned to sport (median follow-up 646 days,
range 1–2060).
Results Of the 158 athletes, 26 (16.5%) sustained an
ACL graft rupture an average of 105 days after RTS. Two
factors were associated with increased risk of ACL graft
rupture: (1) not meeting all six of the discharge criteria
before returning to team training (HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.9
to 9.2, p≤0.001); and (2) decreased hamstring to
quadriceps ratio of the involved leg at 60°/s (HR 10.6
per 10% difference, 95% CI 10.2 to 11, p=0.005).
Conclusions Athletes who did not meet the discharge
criteria before returning to professional sport had a four
times greater risk of sustaining an ACL graft rupture
compared with those who met all six RTS criteria. In
addition, hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio deficits
were associated with an increased risk of an ACL graft
rupture.
INTRODUCTION
After ACL reconstruction (ACLR) the typical goal
is to return to sport (RTS) as quickly as possible,
preferably performing at the same level as pre-
injury yet protected from re-rupture. To increase
the chances of successful and safe RTS, specific cri-
teria have been developed.
Many RTS criteria have been suggested, some
based on the time from ACLR as the only criterion
for RTS,1 others advocating combining time with
subjective and objective criteria.2 The most com-
monly described tests are isokinetic strength tests,
functional tests, clinical assessment and related sub-
jective questionnaires.3
4 Ardern et al5 reported
that, after an ACLR, 81% of patients return to any
kind of sport, 65% return to their pre-injury level of
sports participation and only 55% return to com-
petitive sports. Also, after RTS the risk of re-injury
(graft rupture) ranges from 6% to 25%6–13 whereas
the risk of contralateral ACL injury ranges from 2%
to 20.5%.13
Given the high incidence of re-ruptures of recon-
structed ACLs, it is striking that among the studies
examining potential risk factors for ACL re-injury
,
the main focus has been on non-modifiable factors
like
gender,
age,
activity
level
and
anatomical
characteristics.7 14–21 In the only prospective study
that addressed neuromuscular control and coordin-
ation, poor neuromuscular control was a risk factor
for ACL graft rupture.14 Among 281 cases of ACLR,
younger athletes had a higher chance of graft
rupture than older athletes.15 A 10-year difference
in age was associated with a 2.6 times greater chance
of ACL graft rupture. Among 1820 patients after
primary ACLR, younger athletes had a higher activ-
ity level and a higher incidence of ACL re-injury.16
There was no gender difference in the rate of ACL
graft ruptures.16 Compliance with rehabilitation pro-
grammes is substantially lower among younger ath-
letes, which might also contribute to the higher ACL
re-injury risk.7 Based on data from the Swedish
National Knee Ligament Register, the combination
of being young and playing football is a substantial
risk factor for revision surgery.13 17
Quadriceps and hamstring strength contribute to
a
successful
RTS.18
However,
it
is
unknown
whether strength is a risk factor for an ACL graft
rupture. In addition, other factors like poor knee
alignment or poor neuromuscular control are often
described
as
predisposing
factors
for
ACL
re-injuries,14 16 17 19 20 but only one study has
reported data. In a study of 56 athletes by Paterno
et al, transverse plane net moment impulse at the
hip, dynamic frontal plane knee range of motion,
side to side differences in sagittal plane, knee
moment at initial contact and deficits in postural
stability were associated with a three times greater
risk of ACL graft rupture.14
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether
strength or functional tests, which are frequently
used as RTS criteria, are risk factors for an ACL graft
rupture in a group of male professional athletes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee
of the Anti-Doping Lab Qatar Institutional Review
Board (IRB application number EX2013000006)
and waiver of informed consent was received.

 All athletes were treated at Aspetar Orthopedic and Sports
Medicine Hospital (Aspetar) with primary ACLR between 1
January 2008 and 21 September 2015. All players returned to
normal
team
training,
which
is
how
we
define
RTS.
International athletes and athletes who could not be followed
up because they left the country were excluded. Of the 377 ath-
letes identified as having been treated for an ACL injury during
this period, 158 met our inclusion criteria (figure 1).
Aspetar employs medical staff (clinicians, physiotherapists,
nurses) in the National Sports Medicine Program (NSMP),
which provides medical and sports science services to all sport
clubs in Qatar. As part of this programme, injured athletes are
obliged to visit Aspetar for any injury. Consequently, all injuries
are recorded in their hospital medical record. W
e were therefore
able to capture all ACL graft ruptures occurring after RTS
during the period from 1 January 2008 to 21 September 2015.
By the end of this follow-up period all athletes included in this
study had RTS for at least 6 months after completion of their
rehabilitation, unless a graft rupture occurred, in which case this
was the endpoint of follow-up. The average follow-up for ath-
letes who suffered an ACL graft rupture after RTS was 105 days
(range 1–874 days), whereas for those who had no graft rupture
the average follow up was 731 days (range 182–2060 days).
Five surgeons were involved using two different surgical tech-
niques: hamstring or bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) grafts.
Both techniques were standardised and a femoral tunnel via an
anteromedial portal was used for all ACLRs.
Immediately after surgery, athletes who had only ACLR were
advised to weight bear as tolerated and no brace was used. If, in
addition, a meniscus repair was also done, a brace limiting knee
range of motion from 0° to 90° was used for 4 weeks and the
athletes were advised to weight bear as tolerated.
All athletes completed a rehabilitation programme at Aspetar,
supervised by a specialised team of sports physiotherapists who
only treat ACL-injured patients.
Rehabilitation was divided into three phases: (1) early; (2)
intermediate; and (3) advanced. In the early phase the focus was
on controlling swelling, restoration of range of motion and acti-
vation of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. In the inter-
mediate phase the focus was on optimisation of muscle strength,
proprioception and neuromuscular control. Towards the end of
this phase a running progression programme also took place.
Finally, in the advanced phase, rehabilitation was sports-specific
with athletes starting to perform various sports- and position-
specific drills. At the end of this phase an assessment was con-
ducted before allowing participation in normal team training.21
Our RTS criteria were criteria-based, not time-based.
Athletes who met all six discharge criteria (table 1) and were
discharged clinically by their treating orthopaedic surgeons were
recorded as ‘fully discharged’ for the purpose of this study.
Athletes who did not meet the discharge criteria during the
assessment, but who decided to RTS despite this, were classified
as ‘not fully discharged’.
Data collection
Strength
Concentric isokinetic tests were performed on both the involved
and uninvolved quadriceps and hamstrings. Athletes were asked
to perform five repetitions of knee extension and flexion for
each leg at 60°/s and 180°/s, and 20 repetitions at 300°/s.
A Biodex dynamometer (System 4, Biodex Medical Systems,
Shirley, New York, USA) was used and peak torque, per cent of
peak torque to body weight, work fatigue, average power and
hamstrings to quadriceps peak torque ratio were recorded.
Agility
A running t test was performed, which evaluates agility during
running with changes of direction. Athletes were asked to run
forward for 10 m, then change to side-steps to the right for
5 m, then 10 m of side-steps to the left, followed by 5 m of side-
steps to the right, ending with 10 m of backwards running
(figure 2).22 23 Three repetitions were performed at maximum
speed and the average time for the three repetitions was
calculated.
Hop performance
Single and triple hop tests for distance were used.24–26 These
tests measure the distance that an individual can cover while
jumping on one leg. Athletes were instructed to perform a hop
for a distance with each leg three times and the distance was
recorded only if the landing was successful, without losing
balance. The same procedure was followed for triple hop for
distance test where athletes had to perform three continuous
hops. Finally, the crossover hop test was performed. This test is
a modified triple hop test during which athletes had to cross a
line while performing the three hops. The results were recorded
and the limb symmetry index was calculated as the hop distance
of the involved leg divided by the hop distance of the unin-
volved leg multiplied by 100.

 discharge date, graft type used, secondary injuries at the time of
primary ACL injury (eg, cartilage lesions, meniscal tears, medial
collateral ligament injuries) and whether or not the athletes met
the discharge criteria.
Statistical analysis
All data were imported into SPSS V
.21 for statistical analyses. All
continuous variables were tested for normality and presented as
the mean with SD. Between-group differences (ACL graft
rupture vs no ACL graft rupture) were examined using an inde-
pendent samples t test. To control the false discovery rate (FDR)
arising from multiple comparisons, we used the Benjamini–
Hochberg procedure27 with FDR=0.25 and computed adjusted
p values. Any value of <0.25 was considered significant. For
categorical variables, the association with ACL graft rupture was
examined using a χ2 test. Any athlete characteristic or isokinetic
parameter with a p value <0.05 was included in a backward
stepwise Cox regression model to ascertain the effect of the
variable on the likelihood that athletes had an ACL graft
rupture. HRs with 95% CIs were reported. A p value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant for the Cox regression.
RESULTS
Athletes (N=158) returned to their previous competitive level a
mean of 229 days after surgery (range 116–513 days). Of these,
26 (16.5% of 158) sustained an ACL graft rupture and 11
(7.0% of 158) sustained a contralateral rupture of their native
ACL. Of the athletes who sustained an ACL graft rupture during
the follow-up period, 17 (65.4% of 26) were re-injured within
the first 6 months after RTS. The median time from RTS until
ACL graft rupture was 105 days. Of the 158 athletes, 141
(89%) were followed up for at least 6 months and 112 (71%)
for at least 12 months. Figure 3 depicts the cumulative preva-
lence of ACL graft ruptures.
Table 2 shows the anthropometric, injury and sport character-
istics of the athletes. No significant differences were observed
between the injured and non-injured groups. In both groups,
football was the most frequently played sport, followed by
handball. Table 2 also shows the rehabilitation duration, second-
ary injuries and graft type of these two groups. Nineteen
(73.1%) of the 26 athletes who had an ACL graft rupture had a
hamstring graft and seven (26.9%) had a BPTB graft. Of all ath-
letes who received a hamstring graft (n=108), 17.6% suffered a
re-rupture compared with 14.0% of all athletes who received a
BPTB graft (n=50).
Of the 158 athletes included, 116 (73%) were fully dis-
charged and 42 (27%) were not. Among those fully discharged,
12 (10.3% of 116) suffered an ACL graft rupture compared
with 14 (33.3% of 42) of those who were not fully discharged
(p<0.001).
Table 3 shows the comparison of isokinetic and functional
tests between the groups. Between-group differences were found
in the per cent of peak torque to body weight of the involved
hamstrings at 60°/s, the hamstring to quadriceps ratio of the
involved leg at 60°/s, the average power of the involved ham-
strings at 60, 180 and 300°/s and the per cent of peak torque to

 body weight of the involved hamstrings at 300°/s. These vari-
ables, as well as whether or not patients were fully discharged,
were included in the Cox regression model.
The Cox regression model identified hamstring to quadriceps
ratio at 60°/s and whether or not an athlete had been fully dis-
charged as risk factors for an ACL graft rupture. Those who had
a lower hamstring to quadriceps ratio had a greater risk of ACL
graft rupture (HR 10.6 per 10% difference, 95% CI 10.2 to 11,
p=0.005), and those who were not fully discharged had a four
times greater likelihood of sustaining an ACL graft rupture (HR
4.1, 95% CI 1.9 to 9.2, p<0.001).
DISCUSSION
W
e found that the athletes who did not meet the specific dis-
charge criteria before RTS and were not fully discharged from
ACLR rehabilitation by the surgeon had a four times greater risk
of sustaining an ACL graft rupture (73%) compared with those
who returned to their sport after passing the RTS criteria
(27%).
Graft rupture rates ranging from 6% to 25% have been
reported in the literature.1 8 13 28–36 Bourke et al31 followed
186 patients for 15 years after isolated hamstring graft ACLR
surgery and reported an 18% rate of ipsilateral ACL graft
rupture for all age groups (average age 25.8 years). In a 2-year
follow-up study of 98 patients who underwent ACLR, Kamien
et al34 reported a 25% rate of graft failure for patients younger
than 25 years. Therefore, the observed overall graft rupture rate
of 17% observed in our study is comparable to previous litera-
ture,31 34 when taking into account the fact that every patient
included in our study was a professional athlete of average age
22 years who went back to his pre-injury level of sports
participation.
Factors that might influence the risk of graft rupture
One factor that is often considered to contribute to an increased
risk of ACL graft rupture is premature RTS without following
and meeting specific criteria. In our study, 70% of the ACL graft
ruptures occurred during the first 6 months after RTS, which
extends previous findings to the Gulf Region population.32 37
One explanation for the increased risk of ACL graft ruptures
among athletes in our study who did not pass the discharge cri-
teria could be impaired neuromuscular function. In a previous
study,38 people with ACL injury who did not pass their RTS cri-
teria had larger kinematic and kinetic asymmetries between
limbs and used a gait strategy similar to athletes early after ACL
rupture. The RTS tests and criteria we applied rigorously
related to the known measures of biomechanical impairments.
This suggests that neuromuscular asymmetries during dynamic
movement may not only affect sport performance (and therefore
lead to failing the RTS criteria), but may also predict the risk of
a graft rupture.
W
e also identified a low hamstring to quadriceps strength
ratio as a risk factor for ACL graft rupture. Strength, particularly
quadriceps strength, has always been considered an important
aspect of ACL rehabilitation and has been identified as a pre-
requisite for a successful outcome.39 Hamstring to quadriceps
strength imbalances have also been suggested as a possible risk
factor for ACL injuries,40 41 although there is limited direct evi-
dence to support this. The hamstring muscles act as agonists to
the ACL by resisting the anterior tibial displacement that results
from quadriceps muscle forces at the knee. For this reason, the
hamstring strength and the ratio of hamstring muscle strength to
quadriceps muscle strength is often discussed as a risk factor for
primary ACL rupture.2 42 Our results provide tantalising data
suggesting this phenomenon may also be at play in the recon-
structed ACL.
Criteria for RTS
Time to RTS (a surrogate measure of the strength and matur-
ation of the ACL graft) is considered an important factor in RTS
decision-making. The current clinical dogma is that RTS should
not be permitted within 6 months of reconstruction.43
44
Although there is little evidence to substantiate this, Grindem
and colleagues45 recently reported a 50% reduction in risk of
knee re-injuries (all injuries, not only ACL) for each month that
RTS is delayed beyond 6 months. However, in addition to time
as a criterion, knee function evaluated by RTS tests is also a key
element in the decision-making process.1
Several batteries of tests and discharge criteria are described
for RTS.1 31 46–50 These tests assess both function and strength.
The maximum bilateral deficit recommended as acceptable for
RTS clearance for functional and strength tests is between 10%
and 15%.51 52 The RTS criteria of our study were also in line
with studies suggesting that a limb symmetry index of 90% in
all hop tests and 85% in isokinetic strength tests be used.53 54 It
has been hypothesised that meeting these criteria implies a good
recovery of muscle strength and neuromuscular control, and
therefore ensures safe RTS.
The test batteries used to guide RTS are reliable and able to
discriminate between people with ACL injury and healthy con-
trols.53 54 However, no previous prospective studies have exam-
ined whether these RTS criteria predict those who are at
increased risk of ACL graft rupture. Given the high incidence of
ACL graft ruptures, there is legitimate concern over the clinical
criteria that are used to determine clearance to RTS.
In our study, completing the rehabilitation programme and
meeting our discharge criteria was associated with substantially
lower odds of suffering an ACL graft rupture. Meeting stringent
RTS criteria may reduce the risk of a future ACL graft rupture,
and suggests that a RTS test battery with associated criteria may
be a useful component of the RTS decision-making process.
However, only 41% of surgeons report using strength or func-
tional tests to assist their RTS decision-making.55
Although our multiple regression analysis did not identify
hamstring weakness alone as a risk factor for graft rupture, the
univariate tests showed a consistent trend of a hamstring
strength deficit being associated with increased risk across all of
the six strength variables tested (p=0.04–0.08). W
e acknow-
ledge that the current study was exploratory, not hypothesis-
driven, and a large number of candidate risk factor variables
were explored in the univariate analyses. As indicated by the
adjusted p values, these findings must therefore be interpreted
with caution. Nevertheless, these data suggest that sufficient
hamstring strength and, consequently, an appropriate balance
between hamstrings and quadriceps muscle strength is an
important goal of ACL rehabilitation and should be used as a
RTS criterion. However, these results need to be confirmed in
future studies.
Our strength results cannot be compared with previous
research since no studies have examined strength as a risk
factor for ACL graft rupture. However, some research is avail-
able
on
strength
as
a
risk
factor
for
primary
ACL
injury.40 41 56 57 These studies confirm the importance of a
balanced hamstring and quadriceps strength in people with
ACL injury and are consistent with our findings. Raschner
et al,57 after retrospectively following 370 alpine skiers, con-
cluded that hamstring to quadriceps ratio was significantly
higher among athletes who did not sustain an ACL injury.

 Uhorchak et al,56 after a 4-year follow up of 895 USA military
academy cadets, were not able to identify any of the strength
ratios or parameters as a possible risk factor for an ACL injury.
Although there were no significant differences in hamstring to
quadriceps strength ratios, they reported a relatively higher risk
of non-contact ACL injury for men who displayed greater
eccentric quadriceps strength.
Limitations and strengths of the study
Our study has some limitations. First, the cohort examined com-
prised professional male athletes, mainly ethnic Arabs, which
limits extrapolation to different populations. Second, the number
of subjects included in this study was limited (N=158) and the
number of ACL re-injured athletes was also small (n=26). Third,
limited variables were tested (strength and functional tests) and no
movement analysis or neuromuscular assessment was performed.
Follow-up was a minimum of 6 months for those who did not
have an ACL graft rupture. Nevertheless, the mean follow-up was
786 days and, since the graft rupture rate is highest in the first
12 months (71% of athletes included had passed this mark), we
would argue that this justifies the approach taken. Whether the
personality of individuals who do not complete their rehabilita-
tion but RTS is associated with a greater risk of ACL graft rupture
is something about which we are not in a position to comment.
A significant strength of this study is the tightly controlled
and standardised discharge tests and criteria. All clinical staff
associated with ACLR rehabilitation worked using a standar-
dised discharge procedure. This approach minimised the vari-
ability of outcome associated with individual variations in
rehabilitation. In addition, the study setting ensured that we
registered all ACL graft ruptures.
CONCLUSION
Patients who did not meet the discharge criteria before return-
ing to professional sport had a four times greater risk of sustain-
ing an ACL graft rupture than those who passed the RTS
criteria. In addition, hamstring strength deficits were associated
with an increased risk of a graft tear.
What are the findings?
▸ Meeting six specific objective discharge criteria before return
to sport after ACL reconstruction rehabilitation was
associated with approximately one-quarter the risk of ACL
graft rupture.
▸ For every 10% decrease in the hamstring to quadriceps
strength ratio there was a 10.6 times higher risk of
sustaining an ACL graft rupture.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Meeting specific objective discharge criteria can reduce the
relative risk of sustaining an ACL graft rupture by four times.
▸ Careful attention to athletes achieving an appropriate
hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio before discharge after
ACL reconstruction may help to reduce the likelihood of ACL
graft rupture.
