Abstract
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) belongs to a large class of proteins that solubilize lipids for 
physiological transport. Humans have three different APOE alleles—APOE ε2, APOE ε3 and 
APOE ε4—and genetic studies identified ApoE4 as the strongest genetic risk factor for 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). People who are homozygous for ApoE4 (i.e. ApoE4/E4) are an order 
of magnitude more likely to develop late-onset AD (LOAD) than ApoE3/E3 carriers. Several 
differences between ApoE3 and ApoE4 may contribute to AD including the observation that 
ApoE4 is degraded to a greater extent than ApoE3 in the human brain. Experiments with high-
temperature requirement serine peptidase A1 (HtrA1), which is found in the nervous system, 
demonstrate that HtrA1 is an allele-selective ApoE-degrading enzyme that degrades ApoE4 more 
quickly than ApoE3. This activity is specific to HtrA1, as similar assays with HtrA2 showed 
minimal ApoE4 proteolysis and trypsin had no preference between ApoE4 and ApoE3. HtrA1 has 
also been reported to cleave the tau protein (Tau) and the amyloid protein precursor (APP) to 
hinder the formation of toxic amyloid deposits associated with AD. Competition assays with 
ApoE4, ApoE3, and Tau revealed that ApoE4 inhibits Tau degradation. Thus, the identification of 
ApoE4 as an in vitro HtrA1 substrate suggests a potential biochemical mechanism that links 
ApoE4 regulation of AD proteins such as Tau.

 INTRODUCTION
An aging populous will lead to a larger percentage of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD). Research into AD hopes to fight this outcome by identifying targets that can treat or 
prevent AD. Genetic studies of families with early-onset (i.e. familial) AD led to the 
identification of mutations of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the presenilins (PSEN1 
and PSEN2)1,2. Mechanistic studies revealed that the presenilin processing of APP led to the 
formation of the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ)3–5, which is the major constituent of plaques in 
the post-mortem brains of AD patients6–8. Increased production of Aβ is associated with 
AD, and, therefore, AD drugs under development seek to target this pathway9,10. 
Unfortunately, early results have been disappointing11,12.
In addition to research into early onset AD, which comprises up to 5% of total AD cases13, 
genetics has also looked for clues for late-onset AD (LOAD), and these experiments 
identified ApoE4 as the strongest risk factor for LOAD14–16. People that are homozygous 
for APOE ε4 allele are 12 times more likely to suffer from AD at the age of 65 than 
corresponding non-APOE ε4 carriers17. ApoE is predominantly produced and secreted from 
astrocytes18,19 and this protein is responsible for trafficking cholesterol to neurons in the 
form of lipoprotein particles20,21. Furthermore, research into the role of APOE ε4 and AD 
has revealed several potential mechanisms that might explain the role of this gene in AD.
ApoE is a 299 amino acid protein with three different isoforms in humans, ApoE2, ApoE3, 
and ApoE422. The three isoforms differ at two amino acid positions, 112 and 158. ApoE2 
has two cysteines at these positions, ApoE4 has two arginines at these positions, and ApoE3 
has a cysteine at 112 and an arginine at 15823,24. ApoE4 is the least stable of all three 
isoforms25,26, and one hypothesis is that this instability leads to accelerated ApoE4 
degradation. Indeed, analysis of human tissue from homozygous ApoE3 and ApoE4 
genotypes revealed increased ApoE proteolytic fragments in ApoE4 background27,28.

 Whether the loss of ApoE4 or the generation of ApoE4 fragments are related to AD is not 
known28–30.
We became interested in trying to identify a candidate protease that might be responsible for 
ApoE4 breakdown. One study using cultures of primary rat neurons demonstrated that an 
extracellular serine protease is responsible for ApoE4 processing, though the enzyme was 
not identified31. High-temperature requirement serine peptidase A1 (HtrA1) belongs to the 
serine peptidase family. Biochemical experiments have revealed that amyloid precursor 
protein (APP) and Tau are both HtrA1 substrates32,33. Oligomerization of 
hyperphosphorylated Tau to form neurofibrillary tangles is another hallmark of AD, and in 
vitro experiments with HtrA1 showed that this protease can disentangle Tau fibrils and 
cleave Tau34. Here, we examined the possibility that ApoE4 may also be an HtrA1 substrate.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
ApoEs are HtrA1 substrates
We tested whether HtrA1 is able to mediate the proteolysis of ApoE4. These initial 
experiments were carried out with purified recombinant ApoE proteins and HtrA1. We 
incubated recombinant ApoE3 and ApoE4 with various doses of human HtrA1 (10–50 μg/
mL). Degradation of ApoE3 and ApoE4 was measured by SDS-PAGE followed by 
Coomassie staining to visualize remaining full-length ApoE protein and ApoE proteolytic 
fragments. Upon proteolysis of ApoE, we observed decreased levels of full-length ApoE 
with corresponding appearance of lower molecular weight proteolytic fragments (Figure 1). 
Higher concentrations of HtrA1 led to increased proteolysis of ApoEs and their proteolytic 
fragments (i.e. 20 kDa and 25 kDa in ApoE4 degradation). Mutation of the HtrA1 catalytic 
serine residue (Ser328) to alanine (HtrA1S328A) is unable to cleave ApoE proteins (Figure 
1), which rules out any contaminating proteases as the source of the degradation. Thus, 
HtrA1 can cleave ApoEs in vitro.
HtrA1 cleavage of ApoE is allele selective
Comparison of the processing of ApoE3 and ApoE4 indicated that ApoE4 is a better 
substrate for HtrA1 than ApoE3. At every dose of HtrA1 there is less ApoE4 than ApoE3 
and cleavage of ApoE4 generates more proteolytic fragments than ApoE3 (Figure 1).
We quantified any preference for ApoE4 by measuring the percent degradation of ApoE3 
and ApoE4 in the presence of HtrA1 over a 22-hour period. Over this time period, we 
observed more ApoE4 than ApoE3 degradation (Figure 2A and 2B). ApoE3 and ApoE4 
share three major proteolysis fragments at ~25, ~20, and ~12 kDa. Proteomics experiments 
identified these fragments as amino acids 1–195 (~25 kDa), 139–299 (~20 kDa), and 196–
299 (~12 kDa) (Figure S1). With ApoE3 these fragments appear stable and continue to 
accumulate throughout the experiment (Figure 2A). By contrast, the similar ApoE4 
fragments are less stable and the levels of most ApoE4 fragments decrease between 10 and 
22 hours indicating further proteolysis of these fragments (Figure 2B). Furthermore, ApoE4 
proteolysis results in an entire set of proteolytic fragments between 10–20 kDa and less than 
10 kDa that are not observed for ApoE3 (Figure 2B). For example, we identified fragments

 between amino acids 1–125, and 222–299 that are unique to ApoE4 and not observed in the 
ApoE3 proteolysis (Figure S1).
A plot of degradation percentage against incubation time showed that cleavage of ApoE4 
was much faster than ApoE3. At 8 hours, for instance, over 80% of the starting ApoE4 was 
degraded while less than 40% ApoE3 had undergone proteolysis (Figure 2C). And after 22 
hours, almost all ApoE4 was cleaved, while only slightly more than 60% of the ApoE3 was 
gone. To quantitate the differences between ApoE alleles, we defined the half-life as the time 
where 50% of the ApoE was degraded. With a half-life of about 2 hours for ApoE4 and a 
half-life of nearly 13 hours for ApoE3, HtrA1 has a clear allele selectivity for ApoE4 over 
ApoE3 (Figure 2C). We also calculated reaction rates by a linear fit of the first four time 
points, and found that the reaction rate for ApoE4 proteolysis is about 7.4 times faster than 
that for ApoE3 (5.72 and 0.77 × 10−8 M•s−1 respectively, Figure S2).
Specificity of HtrA1-ApoE4 enzyme-substrate interaction
In addition to the knowledge that ApoE4 is a better HtrA1 substrate than ApoE3, we wanted 
to know whether ApoE4 is a better substrate than other proteins too. We tested this by 
performing the cleavage reaction in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0.1 mg/
mL). If HtrA1 binds to and/or cleaves BSA, we would expect to observe a slowing in the 
ApoE4 processing. Comparison of the ApoE4 proteolysis by HtrA1 in the presence and 
absence of BSA showed little difference in ApoE4 proteolysis (Figure S3), indicating that 
HtrA1 recognizes specific features of ApoE4 protein.
Next, we wanted to know whether other peptidases are also able to cleave ApoE4. We tested 
HtrA2, the 26S proteasome, and trypsin. HtrA2 has an almost identical catalytic domain to 
HtrA1 (Figure 3A and S4), however, our biochemical studies indicate that HtrA2 cannot 
cleave either ApoE3 or ApoE4 (Figure 3B and 3C). We also found no proteolysis of ApoE4 
in the presence of the 26S proteasome (Figure S5). The fact that HtrA2 and 26S proteasome 
are not ApoE degrading enzymes indicates that ApoE4 degradation not general.
Furthermore, trypsin cleaves both ApoE3 and ApoE4, but we found no allele specificity with 
trypsin (Figure 3D). Comparison of HtrA1 and trypsin indicates unique features about 
HtrA1-ApoE4 interaction, and indicates that ApoE4 specific degradation is more 
complicated than ApoE4 being less stable than ApoE3. In addition, the proteolytic 
fragments of ApoE3 and ApoE4 generated by trypsin differ from HtrA1, indicating that 
these enzymes use different cleavage sites, which could be part of the explanation of the 
allele selectivity.
ApoE is degraded by HtrA1 in cell culture
Next, we tested whether HtrA1 can process ApoE4 in cell culture. We transfected full-length 
HtrA1 with a C-terminal myc tag into HEK293T cells. HtrA1 has a validated N-terminal 
signaling sequence that directs this enzyme through the secretory pathway, and western blot 
analysis revealed that most of the myc-tagged HtrA1 is secreted into the cell culture media 
(Figure 4A). Incubation of ApoE4 with the cell lysate or conditioned media showed that 
ApoE4 is only degraded in the conditioned media, which contains the highest levels of 
HtrA1 (Figure 4B and S6).

 To control for the possibility that another extracellular protease is responsible for ApoE4 
proteolysis, we repeated the experiment using a catalytically inactive HtrA1 mutant 
(HtrA1S328A). HtrA1S328A was highly expressed in HEK293T cells and, like wildtype 
HtrA1, was predominately secreted from the cell (Figure 4A). Conditioned media and cell 
lysate from HEK293T cells transfected with HtrA1S328A had no activity indicating that 
HtrA1 is responsible for the ApoE4 proteolysis (Figure 4B and S6). Exogenous HtrA1 
expression and secretion is sufficient to mediate ApoE4 cleavage in cell culture, and given 
that ApoE4 is secreted from astrocytes supports a potential interaction between these two 
proteins in tissues.
In addition, we compared ApoE3 and ApoE4 cleavage using conditioned media from 
HEK293T cells transfected with wildtype full-length HtrA1. Both ApoE3 and ApoE4 
showed a dose-dependent degradation, but ApoE4 has more proteolytic fragments (Figure 
4C). The fragments are similar in size as degradation in vitro by recombinant ΔN-HtrA1. We 
also performed ApoE degradation over a 26-hour time course by full-length HtrA1 from 
HEK293T conditioned media (Figure S7). Similarly as ΔN-HtrA1 cleavage, several ApoE4, 
but not ApoE3, fragments underwent further proteolysis.
Next, we wanted to test whether endogenous HtrA1 is sufficient to induce allele selective 
degradation of ApoE proteins. U-87 MG human brain glioblastoma cells have the highest 
HtrA1 mRNA level according to Human Protein Atlas35. We observed robust HtrA1 
secretion in conditioned media from U-87 cells (Figure S8). Incubation of ApoE proteins 
with U-87 conditioned media showed a dose-dependent proteolysis for ApoE4, while ApoE3 
cleavage was limited, and the cleavage pattern was similar as purified ΔN-HtrA1 and full-
length HtrA1 from HEK293T conditioned medium (Figure 5A).
We then sought to block in vitro ApoE degradation by an HtrA1 inhibitor (HtrA1 Boronic 
Acid Inhibitor, HBAI) (Figure 5B), which has an IC50 about 0.21 μM36. We chose chemical 
inhibition over siRNA because this was certain to block the majority of HtrA1 activity. We 
validated the specificity of HBAI by activity-based proteomics37. We added HBAI at several 
doses (5–100 uM) to mouse brain lysate in the absence or presence of recombinant ΔN-
HtrA1 (for easier analysis) followed by addition of the activity based probe FP-TAMRA. 
Analysis of the reactions by SDS-PAGE revealed HtrA1 was inhibited by HBAI (Figure S9), 
but no other proteins showed reduced FP-TAMRA labeling which indicates that HBAI 
specifically inhibits HtrA1 in the brain proteome. HBAI was also able to block in vitro 
ApoE degradation by recombinant ΔN-HtrA1 (Figure S10). Next, we used HBAI to test 
whether HtrA1 is responsible for ApoE4 in U-87 by adding the inhibitor at different doses 
(0–5 μM) and measuring ApoE4 degradation. HtrA1 inhibition blocked ApoE4 degradation 
to indicate that HtrA1 is the primary enzyme responsible for ApoE4 proteolysis in U-87 
conditioned media (Figure 5C).
ApoE4 inhibits Tau proteolysis by HtrA1
One AD associated pathology is the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles generated by 
abnormal aggregation of Tau proteins. In vitro biochemical studies into the regulation of Tau 
led to the identification of HtrA1 as a Tau degrading enzyme. HtrA1 has recently been

 reported to have a non-proteolytic activity that enables it to disentangle Tau neurofibrillary 
tangles, suggesting that it can regulate the levels and aggregation of Tau34.
Since ApoE4 is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and HtrA1 is able to 
cleave both ApoE4 and Tau, we wondered whether ApoE4 might compete with Tau as a 
substrate for HtrA1. To test this hypothesis, we incubated recombinant Tau protein with pure 
HtrA1 enzyme in the presence of ApoE proteins and analyzed the results at various times 
(Figure 6). Without ApoE present, HtrA1 degraded Tau leading to a steady decrease in full-
length Tau levels over time. And after 90 minutes all of the Tau protein is gone. In the 
presence of ApoE proteins, we observed a slowdown of Tau degradation, but ApoE4 was a 
better inhibitor than ApoE3. After 90 minutes, about 40% of full-length Tau protein was still 
intact in the presence of ApoE4, while only about 20% remained in the ApoE3-containing 
reaction. A great deal more work needs to be performed in vivo to determine whether 
ApoE4 and Tau are endogenous substrates of HtrA1. Nevertheless, the concept that ApoE4 
proteolysis, which is more prevalent than ApoE2 or ApoE3, is competing with the 
degradation of AD-related proteins like Tau is compelling whether or not HtrA1 is involved.
Taken together, ApoE and Tau are likely competitive substrates of HtrA1 enzyme, and the 
preference of ApoE4 over ApoE3 resulted in delayed degradation of Tau aggregates, which 
provides a new possible mechanism leading to Alzheimer’s disease.
CONCLUSION
As the most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, understanding 
the biochemical, cellular, and physiological function and regulation of ApoE4 is of 
paramount importance. Here, we tested the possibility that the serine protease HtrA1, which 
had previously been linked to APP and Tau, is able to proteolytically degrade ApoE4. Our 
biochemical results indicate that HtrA1 is a candidate ApoE4 regulating enzyme, but 
additional work in vivo will be necessary to test whether this connection takes place in 
tissues. A proteomics study using the Tg-SwID mouse model revealed that HTRA1 is the 
most upregulated gene between 3 to 9 months of age38, and this presents a unique model 
where we can test the role of HtrA1 on ApoEs in vivo.
Furthermore, we observed that ApoE4 and Tau are competitive substrates for HtrA1. To our 
knowledge, the concept of ApoE4 inhibition of Tau or Aβ degradation has not been 
explored. Although Tau is predominantly an intracellular protein, emerging evidence 
suggests that Tau is secreted to extracellular space in vitro and in vivo39, where it could 
interact with HtrA1. Therefore, by elucidating this possible biochemical link between 
ApoE4 and Tau, this work has the potential of introducing a new mechanistic avenue to 
investigate in vivo. In pursuing these biochemical hypotheses, we will increase our 
understanding of the regulation and function of ApoE4 in late-onset AD, and this may 
eventually lead to new opportunities for treating the oncoming AD epidemic.

 Figure 1. In vitro degradation of ApoE proteins by human HtrA1
Recombinant ApoE3 or ApoE4 (2 μg) was incubated with purified recombinant human ΔN-
HtrA1 (aa 156–480, wild type or S328A mutant) for 2 hours at 37°C. Full-length ApoE 
proteins and their proteolytic fragments were visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by 
Coomassie staining.

 Figure 2. Kinetic study of in vitro degradation of ApoE proteins by recombinant HtrA1 enzyme
Recombinant A) ApoE3 and B) ApoE4 protein (5 μg) were incubated with 10 μg/mL human 
ΔN-HtrA1 (aa 156–480, 15 μL total volume) at 37°C for indicated times. ApoE full-length 
protein and its proteolytic fragments were Coomassie stained. C) Full-length proteins were 
quantified and used to calculate the degree of degradation. The percent degradation was 
determined by dividing band intensity of the full-length ApoE at each time point by the band 
intensity at the start of the experiment (i.e., t=0). The kinetic curves were fitted by nonlinear 
regression and the dash lines indicated the time where 50% of the ApoE was degraded.

 Figure 6. Inhibition of Tau degradation by ApoE
A) Recombinant Tau (600 nM) was incubated with ApoE3 or ApoE4 (600 nM) and purified 
human ΔN-HtrA1 (156–480, 30 nM) for indicated times at 37°C. Full-length Tau protein 
was visualized by silver staining. B) The percent degradation was determined by dividing 
band intensity of the full-length Tau at each time point by the band intensity at the start of 
the experiment (i.e. t=0) and plotted against incubation time.
