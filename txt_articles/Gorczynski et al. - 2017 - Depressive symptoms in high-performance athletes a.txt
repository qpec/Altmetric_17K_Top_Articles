Abstract 
Objective: To assess whether a difference exists in prevalence of mild or more severe depressive 
symptoms between high-performance athletes and non-athletes.  
Design: Comparative odds-ratio meta-analysis. 
Data sources: We searched PSYCHINFO, PUBMED, MEDLINE, CINHAL, SPORTDiscus, 
and Google Scholar as well as the reference lists of reviews of mental health issues in high-
performance athletes. 
Eligibility: We included studies that compared high-performance athletes and non-athletes, 
included a validated measure of depressive symptoms, and included the prevalence of 
individuals who indicated at least mild depressive symptoms. 
Results: Five articles reporting data from 1545 high-performance athletes and 1811 non-athletes 
were examined. A comparative odds-ratio meta-analysis found high-performance athletes were 
no more likely than non-athletes to report mild or more severe depressive symptoms (OR=1.15, 
95% CI=.954, 1.383, p=.145). Male high-performance athletes (n=940) were no more likely than 
male non-athletes (n=605) to report mild or more severe depressive symptoms (OR=1.17, 95% 
CI=.839, 1.616, p=.362). For females, high-performance athletes (n=948) were no more likely 
than non-athletes (n=605) to report mild or more severe depressive symptoms (OR=1.11, 95% 
CI=.846, 1.442, p=.464). Overall, male high-performance athletes (n=874) were 52% less likely 
to report mild or more severe depressive symptoms than female high-performance athletes 
(n=705) (OR=.48, 95% CI=.369, .621, p<.001).

Summary/conclusions: High-performance athletes were just as likely as non-athletes to report 
depressive symptoms. Researchers need to move beyond self-report measures of depressive 
symptoms and examine the prevalence of clinically diagnosed depressive disorders in athletes.

What is already known? 
High-performance athletes face unique stressors in training and competition that predispose them 
to mental health problems, like depressive symptoms. 
It is hypothesized that being exposed to stressful environments may increase the likelihood high-
performance athletes may report mild or more severe depressive symptoms than non-athletes.  
 
What are the new findings? 
Female high-performance athletes were just as likely to report mild or more severe depressive 
symptoms as female non-athletes.  
Male high-performance athletes were just as likely report mild or more severe depressive 
symptoms as male non-athletes.  
Male high-performance athletes were 52% less likely to report mild or more severe depressive 
symptoms than female high-performance athletes.

Depressive symptoms in high-performance athletes and non-athletes: A comparative meta-
analysis 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent research has indicated that high-performance athletes are at risk for mental health 
problems.[1] Researchers have pointed to several unique stressors and challenges that high-
performance athletes face that may partially explain mental health problems, like depression and 
anxiety, in this population. Such unique challenges and stressors include demands of competition 
and training,[2, 3] as well as dealing with injury and recovery.[4] Additionally, some high-
performance athletes are also concerned with body image, especially amongst those who 
compete in aesthetic sports such as diving and gymnastics, which may result in eating disorders 
and substance use.[4] Research has also shown that concerns with retirement, especially when 
brought on suddenly and unexpectedly, leave high-performance athletes feeling vulnerable and 
depressed.[5, 6]  
 
There are several reasons why high-performance athletes may wish to not disclose their 
mental health status and seek support. As found in the general population, athletes fear dealing 
with the stigma associated with mental illness and the consequences that stem from it.[4, 7, 8] 
Perhaps most pertinently, athletes do not wish to disrupt their athletic careers.[9] As a result, 
many athletes may decide to stay silent about their mental health and not receive the support and 
treatment that may be necessary. That being said, some high-profile athletes have disclosed 
mental health challenges and illnesses as part of consciousness raising exercises, although, these 
are predominately retired athletes. Ultimately, non-disclosure may mean that mental health

problems, especially depression, amongst high-performance athletes may be far more prevalent 
than what current research findings show.[8] However, given mental illness non-disclosure 
amongst the general population, it is not possible to say that non-disclosure affects high-
performance athletes more than those in the general population and that high-performance 
athletes would be less likely to report symptoms that may be indicative of mental illness. In fact, 
few direct comparisons between high-performance athletes and the general population have been 
made. Although several recent narrative reviews have examined depression in high-performance 
athletes,[10-12] no systematic approaches to examine the literature have been taken. 
Furthermore, no meta-analytic approaches have been made to directly compare prevalence rates 
of self-reported depressive symptoms amongst high-performance athletes and non-athletes. As a 
result, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to directly compare high-performance athletes and 
non-athletes with respect to prevalence of reporting mild or more severe depressive symptoms as 
measured by validated measures. Findings will help illustrate if high-performance athletes are 
more likely to report depressive symptoms and if additional support strategies are necessary with 
this population.   
 
METHODS 
 
To ensure transparency and comprehensive reporting of the methods and results, this 
meta-analysis adhered to the PRISMA statement.[13] 
 
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria 
  Comparing depressive symptoms 
 
 
 
7 
 
To identify appropriate studies, published work and grey literature was examined in 
August 2016. No limits were imposed on study types or study dates while grey literature 
included program evaluations, reports, book chapters, and reviews. Grey literature was used 
primarily to identify additional eligible studies. The following databases were searched: 
PSYCHINFO, PUBMED, MEDLINE, CINHAL, and SPORTDiscus. Search terms for 
PSYCHINFO, MEDLINE, CINHAL, and SPORTDiscus included: “elite athlete” AND “dep*”; 
“elite sport” AND “dep*”. For searches in PUBMED, we used the following MeSH terms: 
“depression”, “depressive disorders”, “athletes”, and “sports”. A hand search of the reference 
lists of identified literature was conducted, including a hand search of recent reviews of mental 
illness in high-performance athletes. Google Scholar was also searched using the same key 
words to locate additional relevant studies.   
 
For this review we focused specifically on depressive symptoms as measured by a 
validated measure. Following Swan et al.,[14] the term “high performance athlete” was equated 
to “elite athletes” as defined on a continuum ranging from semi-elite (e.g., participating in high 
performance youth development programs, competitive level college sports, programs below top 
level leagues) to world-class elite (e.g., participating and winning consistently at the Olympics or 
other world-stage events). Other classifications included competitive elite (e.g., participating 
regularly at highest level competitions) and successful elite (e.g., participating regularly at 
highest level competitions and experiencing infrequent success). Non-athletes were defined as 
individuals who were not engaged in any sports at a semi-elite, competitive elite, successful elite, 
or world-class elite level. Ultimately, studies that met the following inclusion criteria were 
reported in the review:  
  Comparing depressive symptoms

1) published in full in English; 
2) compared high-performance athletes and non-athletes; 
3) included a validated measure of depressive symptoms; and  
4) included the prevalence of individuals who indicated at least mild depressive 
symptoms. 
Studies were excluded if they did not include a control sample of non-athletes, did not report 
depressive symptoms using a validated measure of depressive symptoms, or did not report the 
number of individuals who indicated symptom severity using a validated measure of depressive 
symptoms. Where studies did not report fully on depressive symptoms, the corresponding author 
of the study was contacted to obtain this information. Two reviewers (PG and KG) screened the 
articles independently to assess their eligibility. The reviewers met to confirm study eligibility 
and any discrepancies between the authors were resolved through discussion until an agreement 
was reached. 
 
Data extraction and analysis 
 
Data extraction was conducted by two of the study authors independently (PG and KG). 
The authors then met to ensure all appropriate data was extracted. A systematic tool was 
designed and used to facilitate data extraction of the following information:  
1) Year of publication, country, sample size, recruitment strategy, age, sex, level of high-
performance athleticism, non-athlete population, type of sport, and study type.  
  Comparing depressive symptoms

2) Depressive symptoms: i) scale used and data collection methods, and ii) and prevalence 
of mild or more severe depressive symptoms. Identical data was extracted for the non-
athlete control samples.  
The primary outcome was the overall prevalence of at least mild or more severe depressive 
symptoms in high-performance athletes and non-athletes, as assessed with validated measures. 
Statistical Analyses 
 
All statistical analysis was conducted in OpenMetaAnalyst.[15] Random-effects models 
were applied to all meta-analyses in order to account for heterogeneity.[16]  
 
The proportions of high-performance athletes and non-athletes indicating at least mild 
depressive symptoms were pooled across all studies reporting this variable, in order to calculate 
a weighted estimate with 95% confidence intervals. Prevalence of at least mild depressive 
symptoms in high-performance athletes and non-athletes were reported using odds-ratio meta-
analysis, with non-athletes used as the reference group. A subgroup analysis of sex differences 
was also conducted, with females used as the reference group. Specifically, a comparative odds-
ratio meta-analysis examined depressive symptoms between males and females in both high-
performance athletes and non-athletes.  Variance between studies was assessed using Cochran’s 
Q and reported as I2. Visual inspection of funnel-plots assessed the degree of potential 
publication bias.   
Risk of Bias 
A 10-item risk of bias in prevalence studies tool was used to assess the internal and external 
validity of each study.[17] Specifically, the risk of bias assessment provided an overview of the 
main methodological characteristics of the reported studies. Two study authors (PG and KG) 
  Comparing depressive symptoms

independently assessed each study for risk of bias. The overall agreement between the study 
authors was considered excellent (Kappa statistic = 0.90).  
 
RESULTS 
The PRISMA search process is presented in Figure 1. The initial database search returned 
855 articles and a hand search identified an additional 17 articles. Of the 872 articles, 193 
duplicates were removed and 679 articles were screened. In total, 25 full-text articles were 
assessed for eligibility and twenty were excluded for the following reasons: having no non-
athlete comparison group (n=15),[6, 18-31] no reported prevalence of depressive symptoms 
(n=4),[32-35] and no measure of depressive symptoms (n=1).[36] A list of full-text excluded 
articles is presented in Table 1.  
In total, five articles were included in this review, reporting data from 1545 high-
performance athletes and 1811 non-athletes.[37-41]  Ages for high-performance athletes ranged 
from 12 to 41 years and 54.0% of the athletic participants were female. Studies were conducted 
in Iran, Germany, Switzerland, and USA (n=2).  All studies were cross-sectional and used 
validated measures of depressive symptoms. Validated measures included the Beck-Depression 
Inventory-II,[42] Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale,[43] Composite 
International Diagnostic-Screener,[44] and Depression subscale of the Scales of the Personality 
Assessment Inventory.[45] Study characteristics are detailed in Table 2. 
The included studies showed to be of low risk for bias for prevalence studies, ranking 
highly in both overall measures of internal and external validity. Risk of bias results can be seen

in Table 3. A visual inspection of a generated funnel plot revealed no publication bias.[46] The 
publication bias funnel plot can be seen in Figure 2.  
 
Depressive Symptoms Prevalence Rates 
Prevalence rates for mild or more severe depressive symptoms were reported by all studies. 
Rates of mild or more severe depressive symptoms ranged from 3.7% [41] to 26.7% [38] for 
high-performance athlete males and 9.8% [41] to 36.5% [37] for high-performance athlete 
females. For non-athletes, rates ranged from 7.6% [41] to 34.4% [38] for males and 6.1% [41] to 
42.5% [38] for females. A comparative odds-ratio meta-analysis found that high-performance 
athletes (n=1545) were no more likely than non-athletes (n=1811) to report mild or more severe 
depressive symptoms (OR=1.15, 95% CI=.954, 1.383, p=.145). There was no between study 
heterogeneity (p=.453; I2=0%) (Figure 3.). When sex differences were examined, a comparative 
odds-ratio meta-analysis found that male high-performance athletes (n=940) were no more likely 
than male non-athletes (n=863) to report mild or more severe depressive symptoms (OR=1.17, 
95% CI=.839, 1.616, p=.362). There was negligible heterogeneity between studies (p=.276; 
I2=21.71%) (Figure 4.). For females, a comparative odds-ratio meta-analysis found that high-
performance athletes (n=948) were no more likely than non-athletes (n=605) to report mild or 
more severe depressive symptoms (OR=1.11, 95% CI=.846, 1.442, p=.464). There was no 
between study heterogeneity (p=.518; I2=0%) (Figure 5.). Overall, male high-performance 
athletes (n=874) were 52% less likely to report mild or more severe depressive symptoms than 
female high-performance athletes (n=605) (OR=.48, 95% CI=.369, .621, p<.001). There was no 
between study heterogeneity (p=.547; I2=0%) (Figure 6). For non-athletes, a comparative odds-

ratio meta-analysis found that males (n=812) were 42% less likely to report mild or more severe 
depressive symptoms than females (n=948) (OR=.58, 95% CI=.350, .977, p=.040). There was 
substantial heterogeneity (p=.024; I2=68.14%) (Figure 7). 
DISCUSSION 
 
The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare high-performance athletes and non-
athletes with respect to reporting of mild or more severe depressive symptoms. Results from this 
meta-analysis show that high-performance athletes and non-athletes do not differ with respect to 
reporting mild or more severe depressive symptoms. Female high-performance athletes were 
twice as likely to report mild or more severe depressive symptoms than male high-performance 
athletes. This is the first meta-analysis to aggregate comparative findings for depressive 
symptoms between high-performance athletes and comparative samples of non-athletes.     
 
Findings from this meta-analysis are in support of previous findings from other reviews 
and studies that have showed similar levels of prevalence for reporting depressive symptoms 
between high-performance athletes and non-athletes.[10, 12] Ultimately, results show that high-
performance athletes were just as likely as non-athletes to report depressive symptoms. Previous 
research does state that due to stigma surrounding depression, high-performance athletes may try 
to ignore or suppress depressive symptoms and may not wish to seek help from sports 
psychologists and other mental health specialists.[47] Given that high-performance athletes may 
be more skilled at or have more sophisticated training opportunities to develop mental toughness 
skills; which are defined as a set of mental attributes that allow individuals to cope with stressful 
situations and more consistently remain determined, focused, confident, and in psychological 
control;[48] one may speculate that elite athletes may not report depressive symptoms by either 
  Comparing depressive symptoms

remaining, or seeking to appear, mentally tough. After all, to report depressive symptoms may be 
perceived as an admission of mental weakness, which may ultimately provide an opponent an 
advantage. Unfortunately, this perception of mental weakness would only perpetuate the 
negative attitudes associated with mental illness in sport and prevent athletes from seeking help. 
Equally, non-athletes may choose to ignore, suppress, and not seek help for depressive symptoms 
for similar stigma related reasons as well, yet do not have access to sophisticated training 
opportunities to develop mental toughness skills. As such, to further and better investigate the 
prevalence of depressive symptoms in both populations, data from clinical diagnoses in the form 
of structured clinical interviews rather than self-reported measures is necessary.  
 
Although no differences were seen between athletes and non-athletes, findings from this 
meta-analysis confirm that female athletes were more likely to report depressive symptoms than 
male athletes.[31, 41, 49] The two-fold increased risk for depressive symptoms in high-
performance athlete females found in this meta-analysis is similar to what has been found in non-
athletes.[50] It is believed that this phenomenon is the result of many different and complicated 
social and psychological factors, including adverse experiences in childhood and upbringing, 
sociocultural roles and adverse experiences (e.g., greater likelihood of victimization related to 
sexual harassment, chronic everyday burdens related to social status), as well as psychological 
attributes related to stress and coping (e.g., negative self-concept, inward focus on feelings).[51, 
52] Strategies should be designed to render more support to female athletes in terms of 
understanding and acknowledging depressive symptoms as well as seeking help. Additionally, it 
must be stressed that this study focused on self-reported measures of depressive symptoms. 
Therefore, findings indicate that female athletes are more likely than male athletes to report their 
  Comparing depressive symptoms 
 
 
 
14 
depressive symptoms rather than have a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms per se. 
Research that further helps address environmental and cultural factors, particularly gendered 
attitudes and values, that shape reporting behaviours is urgently required.  
 
Due to the limited number of included studies, mild or more severe depressive symptom 
prevalence reporting was not examined in different sports. Future research should explore 
different individual and team sports as stressors, levels of responsibility, and rates of injury, like 
concussions, vary greatly.[25] Although Wolanin and colleagues [49] showed differences in 
depressive symptoms with athletes involved in track and field and cheerleading carrying the 
greatest risk amongst high-performance student athletes, these findings are not consistent with 
previous research conducted by Schaal et al..[28] Additionally, other determinants of depressive 
symptoms may wish to be further explored, including various demographic variables (e.g., age, 
race, relationship status, sexuality), physical health variables (e.g., injuries, surgeries), mental 
health variables (e.g., stress, self-esteem), and socio-cultural elements (e.g., social 
connectedness, support structures, mental toughness).  
 
Despite a robust search and evaluation of included studies, a number of limitations with 
this meta-analysis must be pointed out. First, efforts were made to reach study authors by email 
for additional information about depressive symptom prevalence. Such information would have 
expanded the number of eligible studies and provided a more robust understanding of comparing 
depressive symptom prevalence between high-performance athletes and non-athletes. Ultimately, 
a small number of studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. This 
potentially limits the generalizability of our results. Second, most included studies examined 
student high-performance athletes and student non-athletes. Further comparative research is 
  Comparing depressive symptoms 
 
 
 
15 
needed with professional and world-class high-performance athletes and non-student 
populations. Previous research has found that students tend to report higher rates of depressive 
symptoms than those in the general population and this may potentially skew results indicating 
that high-performance athletes have much higher rates of mental health problems when 
compared to the non-athletes.[53] Third, four different validated and reliable measures of 
depressive symptoms were used in this meta-analysis. For consistency and easy comparability, 
researchers may wish to choose to use one validated and reliable measure that has been used 
previously, such as the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.[44] Fourth, we 
excluded unpublished and non-English language articles which exposes the current meta-analysis 
to publication and language biases. Lastly, each of the included studies is based on self-report 
measures of depressive symptoms. As such only prevalence rates of depressive symptoms are 
reported and not clinical diagnoses of depressive disorders. Future research should consider 
incorporating the use of structured clinical interviews and examine the prevalence rates of 
clinical diagnoses of depressive disorders. Researchers should also make every effort to follow 
rigorous standards in reporting in full their results as to minimize publication bias.    
 
Overall, the results of this meta-analysis show that high-performance athletes were just as 
likely to report depressive symptoms as non-athletes and female high-performance athletes were 
twice as likely as male high-performance athletes to report depressive symptoms. Given the 
limitations of self-reporting depressive symptoms, researchers should aim to use structured 
clinical interviews in the future to examine prevalence of depressive symptoms in high-
performance athletes.
