Abstract
A thyroid ultrasound examination programme has been conducted in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan,
after the nuclear disaster in 2011. Although remarkably high prevalence of thyroid cancer was ob-
served, no relevant quantitative evaluation was conducted. We calculated the observed/expected
(O/E) ratio of thyroid cancer prevalence for the residents aged ≤20 years. Observed prevalence
was the number of thyroid cancer cases detected by the programme through the end of April
2015. Expected prevalence was calculated as cumulative incidence by a life-table method using
the national estimates of thyroid cancer incidence rate in 2001–10 (prior to the disaster) and the
population of Fukushima Prefecture. The underlying assumption was that there was neither nuclear
accident nor screening intervention. The observed and estimated prevalence of thyroid cancer
among residents aged ≤20 years was 160.1 and 5.2, respectively, giving an O/E ratio of 30.8 [95%
confidence interval (CI): 26.2, 35.9]. When the recent increasing trend in thyroid cancer was consid-
ered, the overall O/E ratio was 22.2 (95% CI: 18.9, 25.9). The cumulative number of thyroid cancer
deaths in Fukushima Prefecture, estimated with the same method (annual average in 2009–13),
was 0.6 under age 40. Combined with the existing knowledge about radiation effect on thyroid
cancer, our descriptive analysis suggests the possibility of overdiagnosis. Evaluation including
individual-level analysis is required to further clarify the contribution of underlying factors.

Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster on 11 March 2011,
a thyroid ultrasound examination programme (Thyroid Screening
Program) was established for residents aged ≤18 years of Fukushima
Prefecture, Japan (1). The purpose of this programme was to assess the
effect of the disaster on the incidence of childhood or adolescent
thyroid cancer in the devastated area. The first 3 years were allocated
to an ‘Initial’ phase, which served as a control period for evaluating the
following ‘Full-scale’ phase (2,3). As of 30 April 2015, 300 476
children have been tested in the Initial phase (screening rate, 81.7%)
(4). A total of 113 cases were either found to have or were suspected of
having thyroid malignancy, of whom 99 underwent surgical treat-
ment. However, no relevant quantitative evaluation was conducted
so far. We recently estimated the prevalence of age-specific thyroid
cancer in Fukushima Prefecture prior to the disaster (5). Here, we
aimed to compare the observed prevalence of thyroid cancer in the
Thyroid Screening Program with the estimated historical controls on
the assumption that there was neither nuclear accident nor screening
intervention.
We calculated the observed/expected (O/E) ratio of thyroid cancer
prevalence for residents in Fukushima Prefecture aged ≤20 years.

 Observed prevalence was calculated by the number of thyroid cancer
cases detected by the Thyroid Screening Program through the end of
April 2015. Participants of the programme are residents of Fukushima
Prefecture, including those who evacuated outside the prefecture, who
were born between 2 April 1992 and 1 April 2011. Age range at the
time of the disaster was 0–19 years. The number of detected cases
was corrected for screening rate by multiplying the inverse of the
age-specific screening rate (4).
Expected prevalence was obtained from our previous report (5,6),
calculated by a life-table method using the national estimates of
thyroid cancer incidence rate in 2001–10 (prior to the disaster) and
the population of Fukushima Prefecture. In brief, using a life-table
method, 5-year age-specific cumulative risk of thyroid cancer incidence
in 2010 was calculated from thyroid cancer incidence and mortality
rates, and all-cause mortality rates (7,8). Then, the calculated 5-year
cumulative risk was converted into 1-year cumulative risk using spline
smoothing. Finally, age-specific prevalence of thyroid cancer was
estimated by multiplying the age-specific cumulative risk in 2010 by
the 0-year-old population in the corresponding calendar year.
Because thyroid cancer incidence rate in Japan has recently been
increasing (9), expected prevalence in 2014 was also estimated by
multiplying the average annual percent change during the 10 years
(males 1.2% per year; females 4.5% per year; 0–19 years old). The
95% confidence interval (CI) of O/E ratio was calculated assuming
a Poisson distribution. The age-specific cumulative risk of thyroid can-
cer deaths under age 40 was calculated by applying the same life-table
method to the mortality data in the latest 5 years (2009–13).
Figure 1 shows the estimated thyroid cancer prevalence and number
of malignant cases (including suspected malignancy) detected by the
Thyroid Screening Program. The estimated prevalence of thyroid cancer
among residents aged ≤20 years in 2010 in Fukushima Prefecture was
1.2 for males and 4.0 for females. The corresponding observed number
of malignant cases was 54.8 for males and 105.3 for females.
Table 1 shows results for the O/E ratio. The observed and esti-
mated prevalence of thyroid cancer among residents in Fukushima
Prefecture aged ≤20 years was 160.1 and 5.2, respectively, giving an
O/E ratio of 30.8 (95% CI: 26.2, 35.9). The O/E ratio was higher
for males than for females: 46.1 (95% CI: 34.5, 59.8) and 26.6
(95% CI: 21.7, 32.0), respectively. When we assume that the recent
increasing trend in thyroid cancer continues, the overall O/E ratio
was 22.2 (95% CI: 18.9, 25.9).
The estimated cumulative number of thyroid cancer deaths in Fu-
kushima Prefecture (annual average in 2009–13) was 0.10 (0.02 for
males and 0.08 for females) by age 29, and 0.60 (0.27 for males
and 0.33 for females) by age 39.
Using a modelling approach, Jacob et al. estimated that the screen-
ing factor in Fukushima Prefecture was 7.4 (95% CI: 0.96, 17.3) (10).
Our estimate of screening impact was three to four times higher than
this previous result. In their estimation, the detection rate of the screen-
ing programme was assumed to be 2.1 times higher in Fukushima than
that in Chernobyl, based on the ratio of the numbers of nodules larger
than 10 and 5 mm. However, the actual ratio observed in the Fukush-
ima program was 3.4 (4). Screening in Chernobyl was performed near-
ly 15 years ago; recent improvements in diagnosis would have further
increased the detection rate. The upper limit of 95% CI of their esti-
mate would be 28.0 when applying the ratio observed in the Fukush-
ima program. This value is close to our estimates.

 Radiation-induced thyroid cancer cases are not expected to be
detected before 3 years after the exposure according to the finding
in Chernobyl (11). That is why the first 3 years were allocated to
the Initial phase of the Thyroid Screening Program (it was actually ex-
tended by 1 year). We limited our analysis to those aged 20 years,
which corresponds to 3 years at maximum after the potential radiation
exposure. Even when we extended the analysis to age 21 years,
no increase in O/E ratio was observed [males and females: 23.9
(95% CI: 20.4, 27.8), based on incidence rate in 2001–2010]. An es-
timated effective radiation exposure dose was available for 65 (57.5%)
of the 113 detected cases, and was 2.2 mSv maximum and <1 mSv
among 45 cases (71.4%) (4). This is within the annual effective dose
from natural sources (2.4 mSv on average, with elevated values up to
10–20 mSv) (12).
The excess relative risk of thyroid cancer among children exposed
to radiation from the Chornobyl accident was estimated to be 5.25 per
gray (95% CI: 1.70, 27.5) (13). If this dose–response gradient can be
applied to the Fukushima case within a short latency period, the
observed high prevalence of thyroid cancer is unlikely to be explained
by radiation exposure. Additionally, our estimate of cumulative
number of thyroid cancer deaths in Fukushima was less than 1
under age 40, suggesting a possibility that detected cases would not
become fatal. Taken together, our descriptive analysis suggests the
possibility of overdiagnosis, though evaluation including individual-
level analysis is required to further clarify the contribution of under-
lying factors.
Our estimates have several uncertainties. Firstly, although the over-
all screening rate was high (81.7%), there was variation with age at
disaster (0–5 years: 85.7%; 6–10 years: 95.8%; 11–15 years:
83.1%; 16–18 years: 52.7%) (4). Given that the oldest age group
had a low participation rate, we conducted a sensitivity analysis
excluding the oldest age group (limiting to attained age of 18 years
or younger). O/E ratio was 32.1 (95% CI: 25.6, 39.5), almost the
same as the overall result (30.8; see Table 1). Secondly, to ensure
data stability, we calculated the expected prevalence of thyroid cancer
in Fukushima Prefecture using the national estimate of thyroid cancer
incidence rate. A population-based cancer registry was started in Fu-
kushima Prefecture in 2010: incidence rates of thyroid cancer among
juveniles in 2011 were similar to the national estimates: 0.0 vs. 0.9 for
15–19 years old and 4.6 vs. 4.7 for 20–24 years old (per 100 000
population). Finally, we did not have information to distinguish can-
cers which could be ascertained even in the absence of screening pro-
gramme and the cancers which could be detected only when screening
programme was conducted.
In summary, during the first 3 years after the nuclear disaster in
Fukushima, Japan, the Thyroid Screening Program targeting juveniles
has identified 20–30 times more thyroid cancer cases than would be
expected if the programme had not been implemented. The estimated
cumulative number of thyroid cancer deaths in Fukushima (annual
average in 2009–13) was 0.6 under age 40. Combined with the exist-
ing knowledge about radiation effect on thyroid cancer, our descrip-
tive analysis suggests the possibility of overdiagnosis. Evaluation
including individual-level analysis is required to further clarify the
contribution of underlying factors.
