Abstract
Background: In advanced prostate cancer (APC), successful drug development as well as
advances in imaging and molecular characterisation have resulted in multiple areas
where there is lack of evidence or low level of evidence. The[9_TD$DIF] Advanced Prostate Cancer
Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2017 addressed some of these topics.
Objective: To present the report of APCCC 2017.
Design, setting, and participants: Ten important areas of controversy in APC manage-
ment were identified: high-risk localised and locally advanced prostate cancer; ‘‘oligo-
metastatic’’ prostate cancer; castration-naı
¨ve and castration-resistant prostate cancer;
the role of imaging in APC; osteoclast-targeted therapy; molecular characterisation of
blood and tissue; genetic counselling/testing; side effects of systemic treatment(s);
global access to prostate cancer drugs. A panel of 60 international prostate cancer
experts developed the program and the consensus questions.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The panel voted publicly but anony-
mously on 150 predefined questions, which have been developed following a modified
Delphi process.
Results and limitations: Voting is based on panellist opinion, and thus is not based on a
standard literature review or meta-analysis. The outcomes of the voting had varying
degrees of support, as reflected in the wording of this article, as well as in the detailed
voting results recorded in Supplementary data.
Conclusions: The presented expert voting results can be used for support in areas of
management of men with APC where there is no high-level evidence, but individualised
treatment decisions should as always be based on all of the data available, including
disease extent and location, prior therapies regardless of type, host factors including
comorbidities, as well as patient preferences, current and emerging evidence, and
logistical and economic constraints. Inclusion of men with APC in clinical trials should
be strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2017 again identified important areas in
need of trials specifically designed to address them.
Patient summary: The second Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference APCCC
2017 did provide a forum for discussion and debates on current treatment options for
men with advanced prostate cancer. The aim of the conference is to bring the expertise of
world experts to care givers around the world who see less patients with prostate cancer.
The conference concluded with a discussion and voting of the expert panel on predefined
consensus questions, targeting areas of primary clinical relevance. The results of these
expert opinion votes are embedded in the clinical context of current treatment of men
with advanced prostate cancer and provide a practical guide to clinicians to assist in the
discussions with men with prostate cancer as part of a shared and multidisciplinary
decision-making process.

Introduction
The panel for the 2017 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus
Conference (APCCC 2017) consisted of 61 multidisciplinary
cancer physicians and scientists from 21 countries selected
based on their academic track record and involvement in
clinical or translational research in the field advanced
prostate cancer (APC; Table 1).
For discussion, 10 controversial areas related to the
management of men with APC that were judged to be most
important for discussion were identified:
1. Management of high-risk localised and locally ad-
vanced prostate cancer
2. ‘‘Oligometastatic’’ prostate cancer
3. Management
of
castration-sensitive/naı
¨ve
prostate
cancer (CNCP)
4. Management of castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC)
5. Imaging in APC
6. Use of osteoclast-targeted therapy for skeletal related
events (SRE)/symptomatic skeletal events (SSE) pre-
vention for metastatic CRPC (mCRPC; not for osteopo-
rosis/bone loss)
7. Molecular characterisation
8. Genetic counselling/testing
9. Side effects of systemic treatment: prevention, man-
agement, and supportive care
10. Global access to prostate cancer drugs and treatment in
countries with limited resources
The consensus development process followed the proce-
dures previously described (Supplementary data) [1]. The
conference was organised around state-of-the-art lectures
and presentations and debates by panellists who reviewed
and discussed the evidence relevant to the above selected
topics. On the last day of the conference, 150 previously
agreed-upon questions were presented with options for
answers ina multiple-choiceformatsee Supplementary data.
The questions were voted on publicly but anonymously.
For all questions, unless stated otherwise, responses
were based on the idealised assumptions that all diagnostic
procedures and treatments (including expertise in their
interpretation and application) mentioned were readily
available; there were no treatment contraindications and
no option to include the patient in a clinical trial.
In addition, voting answers apply only to fit patients
without limiting comorbidities and for patients with
prostate adenocarcinoma (unless stated otherwise). When
metastases were mentioned, they were detected by bone
scintigraphy and/or cross-sectional imaging with computed
tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), if not stated otherwise. Importantly, in an effort to
address questions from an evidence-based and clinical
utility perspective, panellists were specifically instructed
not to consider cost, reimbursement, and access as factors in
their
deliberations,
unless
otherwise
stated,
although
clearly these are critical factors in the decision making
for the physician and individual patient.

 The results are intended to serve only as a guide to
clinicians to assist in the discussions with patients as part of
a shared and multidisciplinary decision-making process.
For the definitions used for APCCC 2017 please refer to
Supplementary data.
The panel consisted of voting (52) and nonvoting
members (9). The nonvoting members were panellists, for
example, radiologists, pathologists, and statisticians who are
not involved in clinical management decision making, and
one clinical expert who was not present during the voting.
The option ‘‘unqualified to answer’’ (short form ‘‘unquali-
fied’’) should have been chosen if a panellist lacked
experience for a specific question; the ‘‘abstain’’ option
should have been chosen if a panellist felt unable to vote for a
best choice for any reason or had prohibitory conflicts of
interest. The conference also included an explicit approach to
management of conflicts of interest (Supplementary data).
Detailed voting records for each of the questions brought
to the panel are provided in the Supplementary data. The
denominator was based on the number of panel members
who voted on the particular question, excluding those who
voted ‘‘unqualified to answer.’’ In case of questions related
to a topic of a previous question where only a subset of the
panellists had voted for a specific answer option the votes of
panel members who voted ‘‘abstain’’ and ‘‘unqualified to
answer’’ were excluded.
Consensus was declared if �75% of the panellists who did
not vote for ‘‘unqualified’’ or ‘‘abstain’’ chose the same
option [2]. Throughout, the percentage of voting panellists
who gave a particular response are reported, the number of
voters, and the number of panellists for each answer are
provided in the Supplementary data. All panellists have
contributed to the designing of the questions, editing the
manuscript, and have approved the final document.
Importantly, this process was uniquely able to highlight
areas of disagreement and identified priorities for future
clinical research, meaning areas where additional data
acquisition is warranted.
2.
High-risk localised and locally advanced prostate
cancer
The panellists noted that there is lack of precision in the use
of the term ‘‘high risk’’ in localised prostate cancer that is in
part influenced by a discipline specific perspective. The
commonly used definitions of high-risk localised patients
by various societies plus the definitions used in the
STAMPEDE trial are summarised in Supplementary data.
High-risk localised patients have relatively good long-term
outcomes [3,4]. For the APCCC 2017 conference, the
European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline definition
was used [5].
2.1.
Pathology in locally advanced prostate cancer
Pathology reporting for radical prostatectomies (RP) should
adhere to the recently published American Joint Committee
on Cancer eighth edition cancer staging manual [6]. The
new guidelines include the adoption of Prognostic Gleason
Groups along with Gleason scores, the collapsing of pT2 to
one single group, and the use of elevated prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) to increase clinical staging. RP reports should
comment on tumour Gleason scores using the International
Society of Urological Pathology guidelines [7,8].
In men with positive lymph nodes, the total number of
nodes with metastases, the tumour volume within the
lymph node, and extracapsular nodal extension are poor
prognostic factors [9].
In tissue from patients who have previously been treated
with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and/or other
systemic treatment or radiation therapy (RT) no Gleason
score should be reported.
The panel unanimously agreed (100%) that apart from
morphology and tumour stage, the following factors should be
reported from a RP sample: (1) seminal vesicle involvement, (2)
extraprostatic extension, (3) positive surgical margins (num-
ber, length and location, grade at margin), (4) Gleason score,
and (5) grade group. There was also consensus that the
following factors should be reported: (1) extent of prostatic
involvement (96%), (2) number and anatomic region of
resected lymph nodes and number and location of involved
lymph nodes (94%), (3) tertiary Gleason grade (94%), and (4)
micrometastases versus macrometastases in involved lymph
nodes (81%), extranodal extension (81%), and metastatic
deposits in perinodal fat tissue (79%; Table 2).
Current
guidelines
(EAU,
National
Comprehensive
Cancer Network [NCCN]) recommend performing extend-
ed pelvic lymph node dissection for men with high-risk
and locally APC treated by RP particularly if the risk for
lymph node metastases based on available nomograms is
estimated to be �5% despite the fact that there are no data
from randomised prospective trials supporting an im-
provement in outcome with lymph node dissection [10–
12]. The impact of minimal template versus extended
lymph node dissection is not known and the pathological
processing and reporting of the dissected material is not
well defined.
There was a consensus (84%) that a lymph node dissection
should be performed in the majority of men with cN0 cM0 high-
risk prostate cancer undergoing RP whereas 9% voted for a
lymph node dissection in a minority of selected patients and 5%
did not vote for a lymph node dissection.
Regarding the minimum number of lymph nodes to
constitute an adequate dissection in the majority of men with
cN0 cM0 high-risk prostate cancer 76% of the panellists voted
for a minimum of �11 lymph nodes (49% for 11–19 lymph
nodes and 27% for �[1_TD$DIF]20 lymph nodes); 15% of the panellists
voted for five to 10 lymph nodes, 9% abstained.
Regarding the template of lymph node dissection in men
with high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer, there was
a consensus that the obturator region (98%), internal iliac
region (90%), and external iliac region (85%) should be
dissected. Regarding the presacral lymph nodes, 51% of the
panellists voted against and 46% in favour of dissection,
similarly for common iliac lymph nodes 52% of the panellists
voted against and 45% in favour of dissection. There was a
consensus (95%) against routine dissection of para-aortic
lymph nodes (Table 3).

 2.2.
Adjuvant radiation therapy after RP
Adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) is largely considered as
the administration of external beam RT in the postoperative
phase in absence of objective evidence that disease has
recurred or persisted. In the case of prostate cancer this
would mean delivering RT when the PSA is ‘‘undetectable.’’
Interestingly, the definition of ‘‘undetectable’’ has varied
over the past 25 yr by nearly 100 fold from <0.3 ng/ml into
the pg/ml range more recently [13].
Three randomised controlled trials have demonstrated
that ART in case of unfavourable pathological features (eg,
pT3b, R1) after RP delays PSA recurrence free survival; in
one of these trials metastases-free survival and overall
survival (OS) were also improved. Interpretation of those
results is generally biased by the inclusion of men with
persistent disease evidenced by low but detectable PSA
levels [14–16]. Thus, in fact many of these patients treated
on the ART arm should be described as receiving early
salvage radiation therapy (SRT) [17,18].
Because several retrospective studies have shown that
SRT, offered at PSA recurrence, may be efficient and since
this approach may save some men the application of ART,
many physicians defer treatment until there is evidence of
recurrent disease. Unfortunately there is no prospective
randomised trial comparing ‘‘pure’’ ART at undetectable PSA
levels as currently defined versus SRT at ‘‘appropriately’’
low PSA levels.
2.2.1.
ART for high risk localised prostate cancer pN0
The topic of ART was addressed in men post-RP without
lymph node involvement on surgical pathology (pN0), with
undetectable postoperative PSA, and who have recovered
urinary continence.
There was no consensus on ART in high-risk localised
prostate cancer patients. Forty-eight percent of the panellists
voted for ART for any positive surgical margins, whilst 27% of
the panel voted for ART only in case of multifocal or extensive
margins. Twenty-one percent of the panel did not vote for ART
in this setting.
In the presence of seminal vesicle involvement alone 38% of
the panel voted for ART in the majority of patients, 32% of the
panel voted for ART only if combined with positive surgical
margins. Twenty-six percent of the panel did not vote for ART at
all in this setting.
Fifty-five percent of panellists did not vote for ART in the
case of Gleason 8–10 (Gleason Grade Group 4 or 5) as the only
adverse factor, 20% of the panel voted for ART in case of Gleason
8–10 (Gleason Grade Group 4 or 5) alone for the majority of
patients, and 23% in a minority of selected patients.
Regarding radiation field, 51% of the subset of panellists who
voted for ART voted for treatment of the whole pelvis and
prostatic bed, while 41% voted for treating only the prostatic
bed.
Thirty-six percent of the subset of panellists who voted for
ART voted for adding ADT in the majority of patients, 32% in a
minority of selected patients, and 32% did not vote for the
addition of ADT at all. From the subset of panellists who voted
for addition of ADT to ART, 69% voted for this combined
treatment in men with either pT stage �3b and/or Gleason
score �8 (Grade group 4–5); 28% voted for combined treatment
in men with pT stage �3b alone independent of Gleason score;

the subset of panellists voted for 3–6 mo, 43% for 6–12 mo, and
18% for 18–36 mo of ADT.
2.2.2.
ART for pN1 prostate cancer
For men with prostate cancer and lymph node involvement,
cancer mortality rises significantly when >2 positive lymph
nodes are present [19].
The question of ART in men with pN1 disease (assuming
adequate lymph node sampling, section 2.1) and no local
adverse
factors
(no
pT3b,
no
R1)
and
undetectable
postoperative PSA and who have recovered urinary conti-
nence was addressed by the consensus panel.
There was no consensus on ART in pN1 disease. Twenty-six
percent of the panel voted for ART in men with pN1 disease in a
majority of patients, 29% voted for ART in a minority of selected
patients, while 43% of the panel did not vote for ART in this
setting.
Regarding radiation field, 97% of the subset of panellists who
voted for ART voted for the whole pelvis plus prostatic bed as
radiation field.
The subset of panellists who voted for ART also voted on
factors that influenced their decision to recommend ART: 62%
voted for taking both the number and location of positive
lymph nodes into consideration when recommending ART, 33%
based their decision only on the number of involved lymph
nodes, and 5% only on the location of involved lymph nodes.
Fifty percent of this subset of panellists voted for ART in men
with one or two positive lymph nodes in the presence of
intermediate- or high-grade, nonorgan-confined disease and in
those with three to four lymph nodes irrespective of grade and
T-stage, 17% voted for ART in all patients, 15% voted for ART in
patients with �2 positive lymph nodes independent of grade
and T-stage, and 15% in patients with �4 positive lymph nodes
independent of grade and T-stage.
Of the panellists who voted for ART for pN1 disease, 100%
voted for adding ADT to ART. Regarding the duration of ADT in
this situation, 18–36 mo was voted for by 57% of these
panellists, 6–12 mo by 30%; 11% voted for 3–6 mo, while 2%
voted for life-long ADT.
2.3.
Salvage radiation therapy after RP
While RP generally yields excellent results in patients with
localised prostate cancer, the recurrence rates after RP for
high-risk prostate cancer may rise as high as 50–80% [15]. In
the case of recurrence, SRT is a treatment option [20].
The appropriate PSA level at which to initiate SRT is still
unclear. European guidelines recommend initiating SRT
before the post-RP PSA level exceeds 0.5 ng/ml, whilst NCCN
guidelines recommend SRT in patients with confirmed
increasing PSA [21,22].
Two multi-institutional retrospective studies showed an
improved freedom
from
biochemical
progression
and
distant metastases following very early SRT at a PSA
<0.2 ng/ml as opposed to patients in which SRT was
initiated at a PSA level of 0.2–0.5 ng/ml versus higher PSA
values [23,24]. Such analyses are confounded by lead-time
and length-time bias and the topic remains an area of
uncertainty.
According to the current EAU guidelines, the SRT dose
should be at least 66 Gy but the optimal dose may be
higher; the optimal dose and fractionation is unclear and is
being addressed in several ongoing trials.
Combining SRT with ADT may be an option, particularly
in men with high-risk disease. In the GETUG-AFU 16 trial,
the 5-yr freedom from biochemical progression was 80%
with SRT plus 6 mo of ADT versus 62% with SRT alone
[25]. In the RTOG 9601 trial, OS was improved with SRT plus
2 yr of high-dose bicalutamide (150 mg daily) compared
with SRT plus placebo but a significant proportion of
included men had PSA levels �0.7 ng/ml [26].
Regarding the confirmed PSA level at which to initiate
SRT, 44% of the panel voted for 0.2 ng/ml, whilst 38% voted
for 0.1 ng/ml, 10% voted for 0.5 ng/ml, and 4% for <0.1 ng/ml.
The panel reached no consensus regarding a level of PSA
above which SRT would not be recommended. Twenty-five
percent of the panellists considered 2 ng/ml the maximum
value, 19% considered 1 ng/ml the maximum value, 11% chose
0.5 ng/ml as a maximum value, and 19% of the panel voted that
there should be no maximal upper limit of PSA.
The subset of panellists who voted for SRT also voted on
the addition of ADT. Sixty-one percent voted for ADT in the
majority of men, 29% in a minority of selected patients, for
example, based on PSA level and PSA doubling-time, and 10%
of these panellists did not vote for the addition of ADT.
Regarding the duration of ADT in combination with SRT, 34%
of these panellists who opted for the addition of ADT
voted for 3–6 mo, 41% for 6–12 mo, and 25% for 18–36 mo of
ADT.
2.4.
Discussion of high-risk localised and locally advanced
prostate cancer
The consensus questions focused on men undergoing RP
and the topics of ART and SRT. The choice of primary
treatment of high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer
is also an area of controversy, but was not addressed at this
conference.
The votes of the panel showed a consensus on the
required information for pathology reporting in men
undergoing a RP.
There was a lack of consensus regarding the role of ART
and SRT reflecting the many uncertainties and multiple
unanswered questions in both topics. One of the reasons for
uncertainty is that the ART trials did not have an early SRT
arm as a comparator and as such are not comparable to
current practice. Another weakness of these trials is the
relatively high PSA at which ‘‘adjuvant’’ RT was started,
again not comparable to current practice.
As with any adjuvant treatment, ART bears the risk of
overtreatment and can result in acute side effects as well as
deleterious
effects
on
long-term
functional
outcome
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
183
 (eg, potency, continence) but such potential risks must be
balanced against the potential benefits, namely improved
oncological outcomes [18,27,28].
The quest to define ‘‘unnecessary’’ RT and how to select
which patients really require ART and for which patients
SRT is appropriate is currently ongoing. Several well-
powered phase 3 trials (RADICALS, RAVES, and GETUG-17)
will provide evidence on which to base updated discussions.
In the meantime, regarding SRT, recent retrospective
studies suggest that initiating SRT at lower PSA values (<
0.2 ng/ml) improves biochemical progression free survival
as compared with using the traditional recommended
confirmed value of 0.2 ng/ml and rising for definition of
biochemical
relapse
(BCR)
[23,24].
These
data
were
reflected by the votes of the panel wherein a significant
proportion of panellists would initiate SRT below the PSA
threshold recommended by current guidelines.
The addition of ADT to RT as primary treatment of the
prostate is a well-established concept [29–33]. But the
addition, timing, and duration of ADT, specifically for ART
but also for SRT, are less well examined [26]. Accordingly,
there was no consensus regarding the role of adding ADT to
ART and SRT.
Prospectively validated prognostic and predictive mo-
lecular biomarkers are required that will improve the
performance of clinical and pathological features but this
can only be determined in the context of large phase
3 randomised trials with adequate long-term follow-up.
Additionally, the increasing use of next-generation imaging
methods in combination with more sensitive PSA assays
may also alter treatment approaches in the future.
3.
Oligometastatic prostate cancer
3.1.
Definition of oligometastatic prostate cancer
Hellman
and
Weichselbaum
[34]
proposed
the
term
‘‘oligometastases’’ in 1995 for defining a disease stage with
a limited number of clinically detectable metastases.
The biological definition of oligometastatic prostate
cancer is open to interpretation as is the entire concept
that this is a prognostic and therapeutically distinct subset
of patients that falls somewhere in-between localised and
metastatic disease. No formal cut-off for ‘‘oligo’’ has been
defined in the literature [35]. Some definitions incorporate
both the site of metastases in addition to the number of
lesions to define the oligometastatic state [35,36]. Variables
to include in the description of men with oligometastatic
disease include: the distinction of synchronous versus
metachronous metastases, the number and site of lesions,
and whether the patient is castration-naı
¨ve or castration-
resistant [36]. Of importance is also the imaging method
used to define oligometastatic disease. Newer imaging
techniques will detect more metastases in many patients
classified as ‘‘oligometastatic’’ by conventional imaging (CT
and bone scintigraphy). Many patients considered as M0 on
conventional imaging may turn out to have oligometastatic
disease especially when imaging is performed at lower PSA
levels than in the past.
The panel did not reach consensus on what constituted the
definition of oligometastatic disease. Sixty-one percent of the
panellists voted for a limited number of bone and/or lymph
nodes as a clinically meaningful definition of oligometastatic
prostate cancer that influences treatment decisions (local
ablative treatment of all lesions � systemic therapy), 10% of the
panellists voted for an oligometastatic definition which includes
only patients with a limited number of lymph node metastases,
13% voted for patients with a limited number of metastases at any
location (including visceral disease), and 10% of the panellists did
not believe that oligometastatic prostate cancer exists as a
clinically meaningful entity.
The subset of panellists who believed in the concept of
oligometastatic prostate cancer voted on the number of lesions.
Regarding the cut-off for the number of metastases to consider
a prostate cancer patient as oligometastatic 14% voted for �2
metastases, 66% for �3 metastases, and 20% of these panellists
voted for �5 metastases as a cut-off. Of [27_TD$DIF]the panellists believing
in the oligometastatic concept, 52% voted for a biopsy (if
feasible) of an oligometastatic lesion for diagnostic purposes in
a minority of selected patients, while 34% voted for biopsy in
the majority of patients and 14% of these panellists did not vote
for a biopsy.
3.2.
Synchronous ‘‘oligometastatic’’ castration-naive prostate
cancer
This section addresses patients diagnosed with de novo
apparent oligometastatic disease in the castration-naı
¨ve
state, that is, they present with synchronous oligometas-
tases and an untreated primary. In such patients, no
prospective randomised data are available to show a benefit
for ablative treatment of all lesions including the primary—
either with or without systemic therapy.
For men who present with de novo oligometastatic disease,
a total of 25% of the panellists voted for lifelong ADT � six cycles
of docetaxel without local ablative treatment. Eight percent of
panellists voted for local ablative treatment of all lesions
including the primary (surgery or RT) without any systemic
treatment, 22% of panellists voted for local ablative treatment
with a short course (6–12 mo) of ADT � docetaxel, 31% of
panellists voted for local ablative treatment and an intermediate
long course (24–36 mo) of ADT � docetaxel, 8% of panellists voted
for local ablative treatment and life-long ADT � docetaxel.
Among the panellists who voted for local ablative treatment
plus ADT in men with de-novo oligometastatic prostate cancer
and an untreated primary, 28% voted for the addition of
docetaxel in the majority of patients, 39% voted for the addition
of docetaxel in a minority of selected patients; 33% of these
panellists did not vote for the addition of docetaxel in this
situation. If they voted for treatment of the primary tumour in
this situation, 45% voted for RT, 22% voted for surgery, and 31%
voted for either RT or surgery.
3.3.
Metachronous oligometastatic castration-naı
¨ve prostate
cancer
This section addresses men who present with recurrent
apparent oligometastatic prostate cancer in the castration-
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1

 naı
¨ve state; that is, they present with metachronous
metastases
after local treatment
of the primary. No
prospective randomised data are available to show a benefit
for radical ablative treatment of all lesions with or without
systemic therapy as compared with standard of care (ADT �
docetaxel) [37]. A meta-analysis of 20 small studies of local
lymph node only recurrence after primary treatment sug-
gested that, despite a lack of high-level evidence, ablative
node-directed therapy may yield in good short-term oncologic
outcomes and may defer the need for systemic treatment [38].
There
was
no
consensus
on
treatment
options.
For
treatment of men with asymptomatic oligometastatic recur-
rent CNPC 32% of the panel voted for systemic therapy with
lifelong ADT � docetaxel without local ablative therapy of the
metastases. Twelve percent voted for local ablative therapy of the
metastases without additional systemic therapy, while 30% voted
for local ablative therapy with a short course (6–12 mo) of ADT �
docetaxel, 18% for local ablative therapy with a longer course
(24–36 mo) of ADT � docetaxel, and 4% voted for local ablative
therapy and lifelong ADT � docetaxel.
Among the panellists who voted for local ablative treatment
in men with oligometastatic recurrent CNPC limited to lymph
node metastases in the pelvis, 23% voted for salvage lymph
node dissection, 19% for salvage lymph node dissection plus RT
to the pelvis (if no prior whole-pelvis RT), 16% of these
panellists voted for focal RT, and 42% for whole pelvis RT (if no
prior whole-pelvis RT) � a boost to the suspicious nodes.
3.4.
Rising PSA on ADT (mCRPC) and oligometastatic disease
This section addresses patients diagnosed with oligometa-
static disease progression in the castration resistant state.
No prospective randomised data are available demonstrat-
ing a benefit for local radical treatment of all lesions in
addition to ADT, compared with standard of care, that is, the
addition of a new systemic treatment to ADT.
Among the panellists who believed that oligometastatic
mCRPC is a meaningful entity there was no consensus on
treatment options. Forty-four percent of these panellists voted
for continuation of ADT and adding additional systemic therapy,
29% for local ablative treatment of all lesions in combination
with ongoing ADT and addition of systemic treatment, 25% for
local ablative treatment of all lesions while continuing ADT
without addition of systemic treatment and 2% voted for local
ablative treatment of all lesions and the cessation of ADT.
3.5.
Discussion of oligometastatic prostate cancer
In addition to prostate cancer, the oligometastatic state is of
interest in a growing number of other cancer types, for
example, breast, renal cell, colorectal, gastric, and non-small
cell lung cancer. Like in prostate cancer, in these diseases the
majority of data are retrospective in nature and therefore
difficult to interpret. In some cases, treatment of local disease
appears tobeassociated with long-term survival.Prospective
trials are ongoing in several of these entities.
The concept of oligometastases implies that a local
therapy directed at the primary cancer and/or metastases
might improve survival though there is no strong evidence
to support this. There was no consensus on treatment
options, but from the voting it seems that the enthusiasm
for the topic exceeds the evidence reported to date. The
available data are not prospective, are subject to selection
bias, and thus require validation in prospective randomised
controlled trials. Such trials should focus on OS as an
endpoint, since earlier endpoints such as progression-free
survival (PFS) or time to systemic therapy are not well
defined and their clinical importance is less clear. Distin-
guishing between synchronous and metachronous lesions,
and separating pelvic nodal relapse from M1 disease is also
likely to be important. Studies of patients with oligometa-
static disease are of increasing importance, since more
sensitive imaging techniques are anticipated to increase the
proportion of men with radiographically detected lesions.
At the very least, until randomised clinical trial data are
available, large collaborative national and international
registries of men treated for oligometastatic prostate cancer
should
be
initiated
to
prospectively
collect
data
on
consecutively treated patients.
4.
Castration-naive prostate cancer
There was inconsistent use in discussions of the terms
castration-naı
¨ve or castration-sensitive, to designate pros-
tate cancer either not previously treated with ADT, or
cancers demonstrating ongoing sensitivity to ADT. The term
castration-naı
¨ve is used in this manuscript for simplicity to
cover both clinical scenarios.
4.1.
When to start ADT (post-RP W RT or [28_TD$DIF]post RT)
The optimal timing of initiation of ADT, duration, specific
ADT modality, and the indications for initiating ADT are not
well defined. For patients presenting with metastases with
impending complications and especially if symptomatic, an
initial short course of AR antagonist treatment to prevent
the unwanted clinical consequences of testosterone surge is
recommended when LHRH agonists are initiated.
For patients with BCR, the decision to initiate ADT will
likely depend upon several parameters including life
expectancy, time to PSA relapse after local therapy, PSA
kinetics, absolute PSA level, age, sexual function, baseline
fatigue, cardiovascular risk, and neurologic and cognitive
status. For patients with BCR without overt metastatic
disease, the decision to proceed with intermittent ADT
versus continuous ADT should also be considered.
In men with nonmetastatic disease and confirmed rising
PSA (postlocal therapy � SRT), 65% of the panellists voted for the
initiation of ADT only in a minority of selected men, for example,
in case of a PSA �4 ng/ml and rising with doubling time less than
6 mo or a PSA �20 ng/ml (STAMPEDE inclusion criteria). Twenty-
one percent voted for starting ADT in the majority of men
irrespective of these factors and 12% voted for starting ADT only
after detection of metastases.
4.1.1.
Monitoring of testosterone
Current data do not provide clarity regarding the optimal
level of testosterone suppression to be achieved in men
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
185
 with advanced prostate cancer on ADT. The regulatory-
approved level of less than 50 ng/dl, per Food and Drug
Administration and European Medicines Agency, was based
upon the initial leuprolide registration trial and 50 ng/dl
was the lowest limit of detection of the radioimmunoassay
used at that time [39]. Ensuing trials have suggested that
reaching a testosterone level of �20 ng/dl may achieve a
delay in time toward the development of castration
resistance; however, this threshold, as well as the interval
at which to measure serum testosterone levels remains
uncertain [40].
In men with prostate cancer responding to ADT, 44% of the
panel voted for regular monitoring of testosterone levels (apart
from measuring testosterone at biochemical progression) and
34% of the panellists voted for measuring testosterone in a
minority of selected patients (eg, failure to achieve PSA nadir <
0.2 ng/ml), 22% of the panel did not vote for regular
testosterone measurement in responding patients.
Fifty-four percent of the panel voted for a testosterone level
<50 ng/dl (< 1.73 nmol/l) as appropriate for men on ADT, 36%
voted for a testosterone level <20 ng/dl (< 0.69 nmol/l), while
10% abstained.
There was no consensus on the therapeutic approach to men
with rising PSA on a LHRH agonist whose testosterone level is
confirmed as being noncastrate (apart from ruling out
application errors and/or poor compliance). Despite the lack
of evidence, 36% of the panel voted for a change to a LHRH
antagonist, 26% for addition of a first-generation AR antago-
nist, 20% for a change to an alternative LHRH agonist, and 14%
voted for orchiectomy.
4.2.
Chemotherapy in castration-naı
¨ve nonmetastatic prostate
cancer
There is some evidence to support combination treatment
as an upfront alternative to single-modality therapy for men
who present with high-risk localised prostate cancer. Such
approaches generally combine ADT with RT and docetaxel-
based chemotherapy. A total of three randomised trials in
such patients have been reported. The GETUG-12 trial
showed an improvement in failure-free survival (FFS) with
four cycles of docetaxel and estramustine plus ADT as
compared with ADT alone [41,42]. The second trial, RTOG
0521, so far only presented as an abstract, examined the
combination of six cycles of adjuvant docetaxel postradical
RT with ADT for 24 mo (NCT00288080). The STAMPEDE trial
allowed inclusion of high-risk localised as well as biochem-
ical recurrent and metastatic patients. The number of
events for definitive interpretation of survival of M0
patients in the docetaxel arm of STAMPEDE is too low
and no conclusions regarding the effect of addition of
docetaxel on OS in this trial can be drawn [43].
A meta-analysis reported a consistent effect on FFS for
chemo-hormonal therapy in the M0 subgroup as opposed to
ADT alone [44]. Data for OS are not yet mature.
For men with N1 M0 CNPC, 71% of the panel did not vote for
the addition of docetaxel to ADT, 25% voted for the addition in a
minority of minority of selected patients, and 4% for the
majority of patients.
For men with biochemical relapse only, there was a
consensus (90%) for not adding docetaxel to ADT.
4.3.
Castration-naive prostate cancer M1 (metastatic)
Testosterone suppression alone has long been the standard
treatment for patients with metastatic prostate cancer
commencing systemic treatment [45]. Although the major-
ity of men with mCNPC experience a PSA decline with ADT,
the median FFS in a cohort of newly diagnosed mCNPC was
approximately approximately 1 yr, with a wide range
[46]. Subgroup analyses from recent clinical trials showed
that higher volume of metastases and presentation with de
novo metastatic disease are risk factors associated with a
shorter OS with ADT alone. Other purported poor prognostic
clinical factors include higher Gleason score, pain, and
elevated alkaline phosphatase [45,47,48].
Docetaxel given at the start of ADT was the first drug
shown to improve the OS of men with mCNPC in two large
trials [43,49]. The first phase 3 study of docetaxel in mCNPC,
GETUG 15, showed an improvement in PFS but not OS [47].
There is ongoing discussion on the definition of ‘‘high-
volume’’ disease and whether there is a definition that is
prognostically relevant or predictive of treatment benefit.
For a definition of high-volume disease, 74% of the panellists
voted for the definition, as used in CHAARTED (visceral [lung or
liver] and/or � 4 bone metastases, at least one beyond pelvis
and vertebral column), either with standard imaging (59%) or
with any imaging (15%), 6% voted for the high-volume
definition developed by SWOG (visceral [lung or liver] and/
or any appendicular skeletal involvement) and 6% voted for a
simplified version of high-volume of visceral and/or �4 bone
lesions regardless of distribution and imaging used. [29_TD$DIF]Fourteen
percent of the panellists had the opinion that high-volume
disease is not a clinically meaningful entity.
For men with high-volume mCNPC, 68% of the panellists
voted for continuous ADT using a LHRH agonist (plus a short
course of first-generation AR antagonist to prevent testoster-
one surge) as their preferred hormone therapy, another 10% for
starting with an LHRH antagonist (no flare-up prevention
needed) and switching to an LHRH agonist in the course of
treatment. Continuous LHRH antagonist treatment was voted
for by 6%, orchiectomy by 2%, and continuous combined ADT by
14% of the panellists. None of the panellists voted for any form
of intermittent ADT or AR-antagonist monotherapy in the high-
volume M1 setting.

There was a consensus for severe hepatic impairment (96%),
neuropathy grade �2 (82%), and platelets <50 � 109[2_TD$DIF]/l and/or
neutrophils <1.0 � 109/l (81%). For the other proposed factors
alone there was no consensus (Table 4).
In the original publication of the CHAARTED trial, the
subgroup of men with high-volume disease showed a
clinically significant survival benefit and the point estimate
for the low volume patients was the same in that
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
186
 publication, albeit with much wider confidence intervals
[49]. No OS benefit has yet been demonstrated for early
docetaxel use with longer-term follow-up in subgroup
analyses performed in both the low-volume mCNPC cohorts
of the GETUG 15 (posthoc) or CHAARTED (prespecified)
trials [49,50]. Further subgroup analyses for men with de
novo metastatic prostate cancer (majority of included
patients) versus men with relapse after local treatment
were presented but have not yet been published (European
Society for Medical Oncology 2016 and GU-ASCO 2017).
The large STAMPEDE trial included both M0 and M1
patients and no heterogeneity of treatment effect was
observed.
For men who are suitable for chemotherapy and have de
novo
mCNPC
and
high-volume
disease
as
defined
by
CHAARTED, there was a consensus (96%) for addition of
docetaxel to ADT in the majority of patients, 4% voted for
docetaxel in a minority of these men. For the other subgroups of
mCNPC there was no consensus (Table 5). There was consensus
that men with biochemical relapse (N0M0) should not receive
docetaxel in addition to ADT.
If chemo-hormonal treatment is used in men with mCNPC
there was consensus (78%) that docetaxel should be started
within 3 mo of starting ADT and 20% of these panellists voted
for starting even within 2–4 wk. Within 4 mo was considered
sufficient for another 18% of the panellists.
In the subset of panellists who voted for chemo-hormonal
therapy there was also consensus (96% of the panel) for the
3-weekly regimen of docetaxel with 75 mg/m2. Only 4% of
the panel voted for the use of the 2-weekly regimen with
50 mg/m2.
Docetaxel in the 3-weekly regimen does not bear a high
risk (>20%) of febrile neutropenia; however, according to
existing guidelines (NCCN, ESMO, [31_TD$DIF]ASCO[32_TD$DIF]), primary granulo-
cyte-colony
stimulating
factor
prophylaxis
should
be
considered in men with risk factors namely prior chemo-
or
RT,
bone
marrow
involvement
by
tumour,
renal
dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min), or age
>65 yr, and receiving full chemotherapy dose and intensity.
It is not uncommon that such risk factors are present in men
with APC. Of note, there is preclinical data suggesting that
myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which may play a role in

Local therapy in men with mCNPC
The current standard of care for patients presenting with de
novo metastatic prostate cancer is ADT with or without
docetaxel (section 4.3). Transurethral resection of the
prostate may be used to palliate local symptoms. The
rationale for potentially using a local ablative treatment
(external beam RT or RP) in these patients is based on
several considerations. Significant morbidity related to local
symptoms including pain, obstructive urinary symptoms,
and haematuria can occur in these men, either when the
cancer is diagnosed or when it progresses later in the
disease course [54]. A local ablative treatment used upfront
may prevent these adverse events, as suggested in a
retrospective analysis [55]. Local treatment, however, can
add considerable toxicity.
In men with mCNPC, there is no randomised prospective
data to support local ablative treatment of the primary.
Retrospective studies based on registries, while biased by
design, suggest a survival benefit when a local treatment is
applied upfront [56–58]. Similar findings were reported in
men with nodal disease treated locally with either RT or RP
[38,59,60]. These results have to be interpreted with
caution and treatment of the primary for this specific
disease state should only be done in the context of a clinical
trial.
Fifty-two percent of the panel was against treating the
primary tumour in addition to systemic therapy in men with de
novo high-volume mCNPC who are not symptomatic from their
primary, 38% voted for treating the primary in a minority of
patients, 10% in the majority of patients in this situation.
In the subset of panellists who voted for treatment of the
primary in this situation, 71% voted for RT, 26% voted for a RP;
3% voted for other treatments.
4.5.
Discussion of CNPC
In summary, although docetaxel-based CNPC studies have
provided evidence that some patients benefit from early
docetaxel, the field is rapidly evolving and a number of
unanswered questions have emerged [44]. Less than a third
of the panel recommended addition of docetaxel to ADT in
the majority of patients with low-volume metastatic
disease despite the fact that use of data from subgroups
has limitations and is considered hypothesis generating.
Importantly, there is probably significant overlap between
patients called ‘‘low-volume’’ metastatic and ‘‘oligometa-
static.’’ The panel seemed more conservative in relation to
addition of docetaxel than in relation to local ablative
treatment.
Additional studies are needed to focus on identifying
more accurate biomarkers and better understanding of the
underlying mechanisms of resistance to ADT to define a
more precise therapeutic strategy for a given biological
driver for a given cancer and therefore the biological basis
for the benefit of AR targeting and cytotoxic treatment of
their prostate cancer [61–63]. Moreover, since the studies of
ADT plus abiraterone in the mCNPC setting have shown an
overall survival benefit, further work will be required to
determine the role of docetaxel either with ADT alone or
with ADT plus abiraterone[3_TD$DIF] [64,65]. Further studies with
other AR targeted agents including the combination with
chemotherapy are ongoing in the same setting[14_TD$DIF].
Despite the lack of prospective data from randomised
trials, a rather high percentage of the panel would consider
treatment of the primary tumour in some men with
metastatic disease. Applying such a local ablative treatment
to men with metastases in a nonresearch setting could be
‘‘excessive’’ in terms of treatment burden and is unproven
but some panellists have voted for this approach, not only in
the
oligometastatic
setting,
but
also
in
the
general
metastatic setting, and this seems to be done in clinical
practice all over the world.
This ‘‘try it because you believe it’’ approach is well-
intentioned but may result in adverse consequences for
patients, in some cases on a large scale, as in the gross
overtreatment of low-risk localised prostate cancer. In the
era of evidence-based medicine, this approach is disap-
pointing and we, as a scientific community, should do
everything we can to avoid having this happen again. It is
worth remembering that in other malignancies, for exam-
ple, in metastatic breast cancer, retrospective data and even
a meta-analysis had similarly suggested an OS benefit with
locoregional treatment in metastatic disease that was not
confirmed in a randomised prospective study [66]. Despite a
large percentage of the panel considering treatment of the
primary
in
the
metastatic
setting,
there
is
still
an
overwhelming recommendation that this question for
prostate
cancer
has
to
be
answered
in
prospective
randomized trials before being widely adopted in clinical
practice. Several such trials are currently testing whether a
local
definitive
treatment
directed
to
the
prostate
primary cancer can improve patient outcome in men with
mCNPC (eg, NCT00268476, NCT01957436, NCT02454543;
ISRCTN06890529).

Castration-resistant prostate cancer
5.1.
Sequencing and combinations in mCRPC
The field of prostate cancer drug development has seen
remarkable progress in the past 10 yr. However, this
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
188
 progress is largely based on registration studies conducted
by a ‘‘one size fits all’’ approach in a regulatory framework
that focused on prior therapy with ADT and docetaxel
exposure rather than one defined by individual patient
biology. With current knowledge about heterogeneity in
prostate cancer, future registration trials will need to have
more specific eligibility criteria related to the mechanism of
action of the drug being studied.
Because the registration trials for each of these agents
were
conducted
contemporaneously,
the
question
of
sequencing of the available treatment options is still
relevant. The earlier inclusion of docetaxel as part of a
chemo-hormonal therapy regimen in CNPC (section 4.2 and
4.3) may have implications on subsequent treatment
choices. None of the registration trials for agents in the
CRPC setting included such patients.
5.1.1.
First-line treatment for men with mCRPC
Several prospective randomised phase 3 trials showed an
OS benefit for first-line treatment in men with mCRPC. None
of the control arms used in these trials is currently
considered standard of care. Abiraterone, enzalutamide,
and sipuleucel-T were evaluated as first-line agents in
asymptomatic patients, docetaxel in both symptomatic and
asymptomatic patients, and radium-223 dichloride (radi-
um-223) in symptomatic patients with bone metastases
[67–72]. Sipuleucel-T is only available in the USA.
Another first-line trial testing cabazitaxel in two differ-
ent doses versus docetaxel has been reported and failed to
show superiority of cabazitaxel, but has not yet been
published (NCT01308567, ASCO 2016).
There was consensus that asymptomatic men with mCRPC
should receive abiraterone or enzalutamide as first-line
treatment. This recommendation was independent of whether
they had received ADT alone (86%) or ADT plus docetaxel (90%)
in the castration-naı
¨ve setting.
In case of progression within 6 mo after completion of
docetaxel in the castration-naı
¨ve setting in an asymptomatic
man, 77% of the panellists voted for abiraterone or enzalutamide
as first-line mCRPC treatment, 17% voted for cabazitaxel, and 2%
each docetaxel or platinum-based chemotherapy (Table 6).
5.1.2.
Second-line treatment for men with mCRPC
There are only prospective randomised data for second-line
treatment in men who have received docetaxel as first-line
treatment for mCRPC. In this setting, abiraterone, cabazi-
taxel, enzalutamide, and radium-223 (about half of the
patients included were pretreated with docetaxel) have
shown an OS benefit [[34_TD$DIF]72–75]. Currently, most patients are
treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide in the first-line
setting and there is not a lot of prospective data on second-
or further-line treatment in these men.
In symptomatic men who had primary resistance to first-
line treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide there was a
consensus (96% of the panel) for treatment with a taxane.
In symptomatic men who had acquired resistance to first-
line abiraterone or enzalutamide there was a consensus (90% of
the panellists) for a taxane, 8% voted for radium-223, and 2%
had no preferred option.

 In asymptomatic men with disease progression on or after
first-line docetaxel for mCRPC, there was a consensus (92%) for

of the panellists voted for treatment with cabazitaxel and 2% for
radium-223.
In symptomatic men with disease progression on or after
first-line docetaxel for mCRPC there was consensus (76%) for
treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, 18% voted for
cabazitaxel and 6% voted for radium-223 (Table 7).
5.1.3.
Third-line treatment for men with mCRPC
There are no randomised prospective data for third-line
treatment in mCRPC.
In a man who has received abiraterone or enzalutamide as
first-line treatment, and docetaxel as second-line treatment,
61% of the panellists voted for treatment with cabazitaxel, 15%
for radium-223, 8% voted for abiraterone or enzalutamide
(depending on which has already been used), 8% had no
preferred choice, and 6% voted for a platinum-based chemo-
therapy.
Platinum compounds have been studied in a variety of
monotherapy schedules and in different combinations
and clinical disease stages in men with APC [76]. In
unselected
patients
the
response
rates
to
platinum
compounds are not convincing and derived from mostly
small clinical trials.
In men with mCRPC who have exhausted approved
treatments and if no clinical trial was available a total of
96% of the panellists voted for a carboplatin-based chemother-
apy in certain situations: 33% in the majority of patients, 2%
only in patients with DNA repair defects, 14% only in patients
with
neuroendocrine
differentiation
or
clinical
evidence
suggestive of neuroendocrine differentiation (eg, atypical
pattern/distribution of metastases, rapid progression without
correlation with PSA kinetics; sudden onset of rapid growth of
visceral metastases or multiple lytic bone metastases; presence
of paraneoplastic syndromes), and 47% in patients with DNA
repair defects and/or neuroendocrine differentiation or sug-
gestion thereof.
5.2.
Treatments and schedules for mCRPC
Newer androgen-receptor pathway targeted therapies such
as enzalutamide or abiraterone carry risks of class-specific
adverse events. Abiraterone adverse events include those
related to mineralocorticoid excess, hypertension, cardiac
and liver dysfunction, and fluid retention. Enzalutamide can
be associated with fatigue, hypertension, cognitive and
mood impairment, falls, and fractures. Both drugs carry the
risk of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions that can
increase the risk of toxicity particularly in older men treated
with multiple other drugs.
Abiraterone and enzalutamide have been developed
almost simultaneously and there are no published random-
ised prospective trials available that compare these two
agents against each other.
Asked about their preferred choice between abiraterone and
enzalutamide for first-line treatment of men with mCRPC and
no contraindication to either drug, 35% of the panellists voted

 for abiraterone, 24% for enzalutamide, and 37% had no
preferred choice.
The panellists were also asked to vote for their preferred
choice between abiraterone and enzalutamide in patients
with special situations (mainly comorbidities; Table 8).
There was a consensus for abiraterone over enzalutamide in
men with a history of falls (94%), significant baseline fatigue
(88%), and significant neurocognitive impairment (84%). There
was consensus for enzalutamide over abiraterone in men with
diabetes mellitus requiring prescription drug therapy (84%;
Table 8).
The preferred glucocorticoid regimen when starting abir-
aterone was prednisone 10 mg daily for 67% of panellists and
5 mg daily for 27% of the panellists. Six percent voted for
dexamethasone.
There is a retrospective analysis of patients on abirater-
one plus prednisone who had PSA progression with or
without progression by imaging but in the absence of
clinical progression. In these patients abiraterone was
continued and prednisone was switched to 0.5–1 mg
dexamethasone/d. There were responses demonstrated
by PSA as well as by imaging [77,78]. The level of evidence
for this intervention is low.
In men with mCRPC who are asymptomatic and have a
rising PSA on abiraterone plus prednisone, 37% of the panellists
voted for a steroid switch to dexamethasone in the majority of
patients, 35% in a minority of selected patients, and 26% did not
vote for a steroid switch.
The pivotal trial which led to the registration and
approval of docetaxel in men with mCRPC included two
regimens: docetaxel 75 mg/m2[30_TD$DIF] every 3 wk and a weekly
docetaxel schedule of 30 mg/m2 (d 1, d 8, d 15, d 22, and d
29 of a 6-wk cycle) both with prednisone 10 mg daily. In
contrast to the 3-weekly regimen there was no survival
benefit of the weekly schedule regimen compared with
mitoxantrone and the side effect profile for the weekly
compared to the 3-weekly schedule was not favourable
apart from a lower incidence of neutropenia [70]. A smaller
phase 3 trial randomised men with mCRPC to docetaxel
3-weekly versus a 2-weekly schedule (50 mg/m2[35_TD$DIF] d 1 and d
15, every 28 d). There was a small benefit for the 2-weekly
schedule for the primary endpoint (time to treatment
failure) as well as an improvement in OS and there was a
lower rate of haematological toxicity for the 2-weekly
schedule [79].
Regarding docetaxel chemotherapy for men with mCRPC
there was a consensus (86%) that the 3-weekly regimen
(75 mg/m2) should be used, 10% voted for the 2-weekly (50 mg/
m2) schedule and 4% for a weekly schedule.
The FIRSTANA trial compared cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 to
cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 and to docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as first-
line chemotherapy in men with mCRPC. The data were
presented (ASCO 2016; NCT01308567) but are not pub-
lished and did not show a significant difference in OS. The
PROSELICA trial was also presented at ASCO 2016 and
showed noninferiority for the primary endpoint of OS for
cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 compared with cabazitaxel 25 mg/
m2 in men with mCRPC progressing on or after docetaxel
(NCT01308580).
For cabazitaxel there was a consensus (79%) to start with
the 20 mg/m2 dose in the majority of patients, 59% of panellists
use this dose (with dose reductions in subsequent cycles if
indicated), 20% voted for starting with this dose and to escalate
to 25 mg/m2 in the absence of relevant side effects. Seventeen
percent of the panellists voted for starting with a dose of 25 mg/
m2 in the majority of men.
In the subset of panellists who voted for cabazitaxel 25 mg/
m2, 57% of the panellists voted for the use of prophylactic WBC
growth factors from start of therapy in the majority of patients,
26% voted for the use in a minority of selected patients, 8%
voted for use of these growth factors only for marrow toxicity
occurring beyond start of therapy, and 9% do not use them at
all.
In the subset of panellists who voted for cabazitaxel 20 mg/
m2, 30% voted for prophylactic WBC growth factors from start
of therapy in the majority of patients, 32% in a minority of
selected patients, 27% only for marrow toxicity, and 11% did not
vote for the use of growth factors.

Combination therapy for mCRPC
In mCRPC there are currently no combination treatment
strategies for survival prolonging agents that have shown
an OS benefit as compared with monotherapy. A number of
large randomised phase 3 clinical trials combining abir-
aterone with enzalutamide or other novel endocrine agents
and abiraterone or enzalutamide with radium-223 dichlor-
ide
are
currently
ongoing
(eg,
NCT02194842M;
NCT02043678; NCT01949337). The question of combina-
tion
strategies
is
especially
relevant
for
radium-223,
because of the lack of antitumour activity outside the bone
since soft tissue and visceral metastases are not uncommon
in men with APC [80].
In men with symptomatic mCRPC and bone metastases, 18%
of the panellists voted for the combination of radium-223 with
either abiraterone or enzalutamide from the beginning as a
first-line treatment for mCRPC for the majority of patients, 38%
in a minority of selected patients, and 42% of the panellists did
not vote for this combination.
In men with mCRPC being treated with abiraterone or
enzalutamide for bone and soft tissue metastases and who are
progressing only in the bone, 43% of the panellists voted for the
addition of radium-223 to the majority of such patients, 39% in
a minority of selected patients, and 18% did not vote for adding
radium-223 in this situation.
In
men
with
mCRPC
treated
with
radium-223
and
progressing outside of the bone 52% of the panellists voted
for completing treatment with radium-223 plus adding
abiraterone or enzalutamide (if they have not received either
drug before) in the majority of patients, 20% in a minority of
selected patients, and 26% did not vote for this approach.
5.4.
Poor prognosis, aggressive variant mCRPC
While the majority of APCs remain driven by AR signalling,
it has become increasingly recognized that a subset of
mCRPC tumours may adapt during the course of therapy to
become less dependent on the AR, and this is associated
with loss of luminal prostate cancer markers (including
PSA), the development of lineage plasticity, and the
acquisition or expansion of small cell/neuroendocrine
pathologic and molecular features [81,82]. Identification
of mCRPC variants remains challenging but is often
suspected in patients that develop rapidly progressive
disease, unusual sites or pattern of metastases (eg, radio-
logically lytic bone or parenchymal brain metastases),
and/or progression in the setting of a low and not or
modestly rising PSA. Metastatic tumour biopsies in this
setting may show small cell carcinoma, but are not
always straightforward as mixed, atypical adenocarcino-
ma, and hybrid neuroendocrine phenotypes may also
occur [82].
The votes of the panellists concerning factors for definition
of poor prognosis, aggressive variant mCRPC are reported in
Table 9. There was no consensus regarding the definition of
poor prognosis, aggressive variant mCRPC. Four percent of the
panellists did not believe poor prognosis, aggressive variant
mCRPC is a clinically meaningful entity.
The publication of the olaparib data in heavily pretreated
mCRPC patients with DNA repair defects in the absence of
an approved poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymer-
ase (PARP) inhibitor for mCRPC has revived the interest for
the use of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, espe-
cially in later lines. The combination of carboplatin and
docetaxel
has
shown
good
antitumour
activity
in
a
nonrandomised phase 2 clinical trial with patients selected
for poor prognosis features [83]. A randomised phase 2 trial
of cabazitaxel plus carboplatin versus cabazitaxel alone has
been presented but is not published and showed signifi-
cantly improved antitumour activity with the combination
treatment (NCT01505868, ASCO 2015).
Regarding first-line treatment of the majority of men with
poor prognosis, aggressive variant (putting aside pure small
cell carcinoma) 58% of the panellists voted for standard mCRPC
treatment, 36% voted for a platinum- and taxane-based
combination therapy, 4% for a platinum- and etoposide-based
combination therapy, and 2% for a platinum monotherapy.

Monitoring in men with mCRPC treated with radium-223
The phase 3 radium-223 trial (ALSYMPCA) enrolled patients
with symptomatic mCRPC [72]. Patients were randomised
to six injections of radium-223 administered every 4 wk or
to best standard of care alone. OS was improved in the
intent to treat analysis for patients randomized to radium-
223
[72].
Substantial
declines
in
PSA
and/or
lactate
dehydrogenase were uncommon in both arms. However,
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels showed a decline in the
radium treated patients with 87% of radium treated patients
showing some decline in ALP at wk 12 [84].
In the subset of panellists who use radium-223 in men with
mCRPC 43% voted for testing of PSA every cycle, 43% for every
2–4 mo; 8% voted for PSA testing only if clinically indicated, and
6% for no PSA testing in this situation.
Regarding ALP testing these panellists voted for either every
cycle (49%) or every 2–4 mo (37%). Eight percent voted for ALP
testing only if clinically indicated and 6% voted for no ALP
testing.
Since the ALSYMPCA trial did not mandate any imaging
for response monitoring, the role of imaging in men treated
with radium-223 is not well documented. Symptomatic and
PSA flares after radium-223 have been described and can be
accompanied by bone scintigraphy flare [85]. Early changes
in bone scintigraphy and CT assessments tend to be
unreliable for bone response assessment and must thus
be interpreted with caution. In a retrospective series of
130 men treated with radium-223 that had baseline
imaging and monitoring by imaging after three and six
cycles, the results showed a significant rate of progression
outside of the bone detected by CT scanning [85].
In the subset of panellists who use radium-223 in men with
mCRPC there was consensus (75%) to use CT and bone
scintigraphy for staging and monitoring of men on radium-
223, while 23% of the panellists voted for one of the next-
generation imaging methods. Regarding imaging frequency for
men treated with radium-223, 41% of these panellists voted for
every 3–4 mo, 27% voted for imaging after 6 mo (completion of
radium-223) and every 3–4 mo thereafter, 24% voted for
imaging after 6 mo (completion of radium-223) and follow-up
imaging at progression, 4% voted for imaging only as clinically
indicated.

‘‘Oligo-progressive’’ mCRPC
With the introduction of abiraterone and enzalutamide as
first-line treatment for asymptomatic men with mCRPC,
there are men in whom, for example, a single lymph node
progresses in size with radiological stability of the other
lesions. The term oligo-progressive is not well-defined in
APC but in lung cancer patients on novel targeted agents
such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors there
is growing literature on definition and treatment strategies
for oligo-progressive disease [86].
There was no consensus as to the most meaningful
definition of oligo-progressive prostate cancer (mCRPC). Forty
percent of the panel voted that they did not believe in oligo-
progressive disease as a meaningful clinical entity, 33% voted
for the definition of only one progressing pre-existing lesion
with otherwise stable/responding metastatic disease, 23%
voted for �3 progressing pre-existing lesions with otherwise
stable/responding metastatic disease.
The subset of the panel who believed in oligo-progressive
mCRPC voted on biopsy of a progressing lesion (for diagnostic
purposes). Twenty-nine percent of the panellists voted for a
biopsy in the majority of patients, 52% for a biopsy in a minority
of selected patients (eg, from visceral metastases), while 19%
did not vote for a biopsy. These panellists also voted on the
treatment for men with oligo-progressive mCRPC: 40% voted
for a change or addition of systemic therapy without local
treatment, 47% for local treatment of the progressing lesion(s)
while continuing systemic therapy unchanged, and 13% for
local treatment of the progressing lesion(s) plus adding or
changing the systemic treatment.
5.7.
Discussion of CRPC
We have witnessed the successful development of agents
including the novel androgen signalling inhibitors abir-
aterone and enzalutamide for earlier stage mCRPC. More
recently, a significant survival advantage by introducing
docetaxel treatment in the castration-naive state was
confirmed. It thus appears that we are moving our therapies
earlier in the disease, while the question of optimal
sequencing of the treatment options is still unanswered.
We know that a distinct subset of patients will not respond
to treatment also depending on the sequence, or may
experience unwarranted toxicity. Moreover, it is possible
that with the appropriate sequencing we may augment the
OS benefit of our patients.
Treatment sequencing in APC is governed by a number of
parameters that unfortunately do not yet serve the ultimate
goal of maximizing clinical outcome. Clinical decision-
making is still largely dependent on local reimbursement
policies and on a number of variables that are not truly
objective. There are no validated clinical or molecular
predictive markers for guiding our choice thus predeter-
mining a more favourable cost/benefit ratio for our patients.
Increased benefit is encompassing longer life with im-
proved quality whereas minimising cost including compo-
nents such as toxicity, financial burden, and uncertainty.
Choices made in the clinic are in part based on objective
data such as available level I evidence and access to agents.
Yet, professional speciality and experience affect these
choices. The presence or absence of symptoms clearly
influenced treatment selection for the panellists.
We are also being challenged by the as-yet unproven
hypothesis that combinatorial approaches may enhance
outcome by potential synergistic activity or delay of
resistance to treatment. We are anticipating results from
several relevant phase 3 trials and should therefore avoid
implementation of such approaches as long as they are
unproven especially since concerns for toxicity arise.
Regarding the aggressive variant of CRPC, the majority of
the panel recognises its existence and that it is important to
recognise it since these patients may be less likely to
respond to subsequent AR-directed therapies; however,
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
193
 there was no consensus for the exact definition. With a
more profound and eventually earlier suppression of AR
pathways in the disease history, identifying and treating AR
independent variants will become increasingly important
[87]. The development of robust biomarkers is an area of
active research. We may need a combination of clinical and
molecular features to identify aggressive variants, encom-
passing but not limited to those with neuroendocrine
carcinoma morphology detected on biopsy, as targeted
treatment approaches based on a molecular subclassifica-
tion of APC are developed. Understanding the role of DNA
repair in contributing to the phenotype, mediating response
to PARP inhibition, and also platinum sensitivity and
potential immunotherapy treatment sensitivity is also
important.
6.
Imaging in APC
Reproducible and validated methods for detecting and
quantifying metastatic disease are needed to manage
patients with APC. Currently, recommended methods of
metastatic imaging assessment, that is, with bone scintig-
raphy and CT scans, have significant limitations in detecting
metastases as well as in monitoring response to treatment
but remain the standard of care in most settings [1,21,88–
91].
Due
to
limitations
in
systematically
conducted
prospective studies, the use of next-generation imaging
has not been shown to impact on clinical outcome.
6.1.
Nodal disease assessments in APC
Morphologic assessments for possible nodal disease using
CT and MRI scans are based on the evaluation of detected
nodes based largely on size criteria. Other morphologic
criteria, such as the nodal shape, loss of nodal hilum fat,
clustering, extranodal disease, and enhancement character-
istics can serve as additional aids to diagnosis. Unfortu-
nately,
morphologic
imaging
is
unable
to
identify
micrometastases or to distinguish large hyperplastic benign
from malignant nodes. Thus, the general test performance
of morphologic imaging remains limited when histologic
correlations using template lymphadenectomy are used as
the standard of reference. A meta-analysis showed a CT scan
sensitivity of 42% and specificity of 82%, while morphologic
MRI had a sensitivity of 39% and a specificity of 82%
[92]. While positron emission tomography (PET)/CT has
improved sensitivity, it is important to keep in mind that
the spatial resolution of PET/CT is approximately 4 mm.
6.2.
Bone disease assessments in APC
For the sensitive detection of metastatic bone disease, the
use of current recommendation of bone scintigraphy and CT
scans has low sensitivity and specificity [93].
Systematic analyses, prospective clinical studies, and
meta-analyses have shown comparative test performance
of whole-body diffusion weighted MRI (WB-MRI) to NaF
and choline PET/CT for the skeletal assessments in APC
[94,95]. A recent meta-analysis underlined the usefulness of
WB-MRI as a method that improves the MRI detection of
bone metastases [96]. When evaluating the results of the
above meta-analyses and indeed in all studies reporting test
performance, the readers should note that there are
intrinsic verification biases that are particularly prevalent
at lesion level analyses, because it is not possible to obtain
histopathology for every bone lesion detected. As a result,
most studies are patient level analyses, using combinations
of imaging methods and/or follow-up as the standards of
reference [93,94].
PET/CT can detect a larger number of skeletal lesions
than bone scintigraphy [97]. Regarding the PET/CT tracers
comparative studies between prostate-specific membrane
antigen (PSMA) and choline have demonstrated superiority
of PSMA to identify bone lesions [98]. The PET tracer 18F-
fluciclovine has recently been approved for use in North
America; available data indicate good detection rates both
for lymph nodes and for bone disease in biochemical
recurrence of prostate cancer [99]. The diagnostic perfor-
mance of fluciclovine PET was found to be superior to CT
and to choline PET but there are no comparative data versus
WB-MRI and PSMA PET [100].
Importantly, all our prognostic models and clinical trials
in APC were developed using CT scan and bone scintigraphy
and the essence of detection of disease at diagnosis is one of
risk determination. Next generation imaging may have
superior performance characteristics compared with older
modalities, but clinical validation with regard to the
question of impact on outcome has not yet been performed.
6.3.
Imaging for locally advanced prostate cancer
In men presenting with high-risk or locally advanced
prostate cancer and with biochemical recurrence after local
therapy, imaging to document potential metastases may be
important. At this state of the disease metastases are most
commonly located within regional (N1) and nonregional
lymph nodes as well as in bone (M1).
There was no consensus regarding the imaging modality to
‘‘exclude’’ distant metastases in high-risk and locally advanced
prostate cancer: 41% of the panel voted for a combination of CT
and bone scintigraphy, while 47% of the panel voted for next-
generation imaging methods (37% voted for a PET/CT with any
of the tracers PSMA, choline, or fluciclovine and 10% voted for a
WB-MRI).
6.4.
Imaging in the setting of BCR (PSA)
Clinical symptoms and PSA alone are not good indicators for
absence of metastases, with 32% of clinical M0 CRPC
patients being found to be metastatic when imaging was
performed [101].
Regarding PET/CT in BCR, a meta-analysis including both
C-11 and F-18 choline-based techniques reported detection
rates greater than 50% for PSA values above 2 ng/ml, with
rapid PSA kinetics and elevated Gleason score positively
related to higher detection rates [102–105]. The main
limitation of choline PET/CT is the low sensitivity when PSA
values are <1 ng/ml. In BCR there are comparative studies
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
194
 between Ga-PSMA and choline demonstrating the superi-
ority of Ga-PSMA in terms of detection rates at any PSA level
[106–108].
Guidelines
(NCCN,
EAU)
have
mentioned
choline PET/CT in the situation of BCR [21,22].
The use of next-generation imaging modalities has led to
identification of metastatic foci at lower PSA levels. Treating
physicians may feel more comfortable offering ablation of
limited metastases in these cases, but as of now there are no
prospective data to show that earlier detection of metastatic
disease with next-generation imaging results in a mean-
ingful long-term clinical improvement.
Imaging in men with rising PSA after RP before starting
SRT was voted for by 44% of the panellists in the majority of
patients independent of PSA level, by 29% of panellists in men
with a PSA >0.5 ng/ml, by 12% of the panellists in men with a
PSA >1 ng/ml and by 13% of the panellists in men with a PSA
>2 ng/ml.
For imaging in men with oligometastatic recurrent disease
after local treatment for prostate cancer with curative intent
(� SRT), 78% of the subset of panellists who believed in the
oligometastatic recurrent state voted for one of the next-
generation imaging methods to detect metastatic disease: namely
47% voted for a PET/CT (PSMA, choline, or fluciclovine) alone, 2%
voted for a WB-MRI alone, 25% of the panel members voted for a
combination of a pelvic MRI and a PET/CT, 4% of the panellists
voted for a combination of a pelvic MRI and a WB-MRI, and 22% of
the panellists voted for imaging by CT and/or MRI and bone
scintigraphy.
In men with de novo apparent oligometastatic disease, 72%
of the subset panellists who believed in the oligometastatic
state voted for one of the next-generation imaging methods to
support this diagnosis (apart from local staging): namely 34%
voted for a PET/CT (PSMA, choline, or fluciclovine), 4% voted for
a WB-MRI, 34% voted for either a PET/CT or WB-MRI, and 26% of
these panellists voted for imaging by CT and/or MRI and bone
scintigraphy.
Asked about the recommended tracer in case of a PET/CT in
men with apparent oligometastatic castration-naı
¨ve disease,
there was a consensus (76%) amongst the panel members for
PSMA as tracer, 10% voted for fluciclovine as a tracer, and 6%
voted for choline; 4% of the panellists voted for any of the three
tracers.
In men with rising PSA on ADT (CRPC) and potentially
oligometastatic disease, 74% of the subset of panellists who
believe in oligometastatic disease in mCRPC voted for one of the
next-generation imaging methods to confirm this diagnosis:
namely 48% voted for a PET/CT (PSMA, choline, or fluciclovine),
6% voted for a WB-MRI, 18% of the panel members voted for a
combination of a pelvic MRI and a PET/CT, 2% of the panellists
voted for a combination of a pelvic MRI and a WB-MRI, and 26%
of the panellists voted for imaging by CT and/or MRI and bone
scintigraphy.
6.5.
Staging and monitoring in mCNCP
In mCNPC, what is required is an imaging modality that
confirms the presence of metastases and defines their
location. This is important for assessing prognosis and for
treatment decisions. Current guidelines (NCCN, EAU) do not
comment on imaging methods for men with mCNPC
because of lack of data.
In mCNPC, 51% of the panel voted for baseline imaging and
follow-up imaging at PSA nadir/completion of six cycles of
docetaxel as part of chemo-hormonal therapy and again at
progression (confirmed PSA rise and/or clinical progression),
31% of the panel voted for baseline imaging and regular
monitoring by imaging every 3–6 mo, and 18% of the panel
voted for baseline imaging only and monitoring by PSA alone
with further imaging at progression.
Regarding the recommended imaging modality for staging
and monitoring of men with mCNPC, 73% of the panel voted for
CT and bone scintigraphy and 25% of the panellists voted for
one of the next-generation imaging methods.
6.6.
Staging and monitoring in mCRPC
The early identification of treatment failure in men with
mCRPC on systemic therapy would help in sparing some
patients futile treatment and potential toxicity as well as in
reducing the costs of ineffective treatments and decreasing
the time to initiation of a next-line, potentially effective
treatment [110]. Recent data indicate that there are a
substantial number of patients who have radiographic
progression
without
PSA
progression,
including
some
patients with aggressive variant prostate cancer [111]. Im-
aging before treatment initiation and on-therapy may be
important in predicting both benefit and more importantly
nonbenefit of treatments.
An ideal imaging method to monitor response to therapy
should enable the evaluation of tumour cell viability,
especially for bone disease. Techniques such as bone
scintigraphy, CT scans, and NaF PET rely on tumour matrix
interactions and are only indirect indicators of tumour cell
viability. Imaging assessments should always be combined
with clinical status and other factors as also recommended
by the PCWG3 group [109].
For monitoring by imaging in men with mCRPC on first-line
therapy, 54% of the panel voted for baseline imaging and
regular monitoring by imaging every 3–6 mo, 28% of the
panellists voted for baseline imaging and follow-up imaging at
PSA nadir and again at progression (confirmed PSA rise and/or
clinical progression); 16% of the panel voted for baseline
imaging only and monitoring by PSA alone with further
imaging at progression.
Regarding imaging modality for staging and monitoring in
men with mCRPC, 74% of the panel voted for CT and bone
scintigraphy and 24% of the panellists voted for one of the next-
generation imaging methods.
For monitoring of patients with a diagnosis of aggressive
variant mCRPC, 62% of the panellists voted for standard
imaging by CT and bone scintigraphy, 2% voted for CT alone,
and 36% voted for next-generation imaging modalities.
6.7.
Discussion of imaging in APC
There are sufficient data indicating that next-generation
imaging technologies have better accuracy for detecting
metastases than CT and bone scintigraphy. However, their
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
195
 current use is dependent on costs, local availability, and
expertise of interpretation and the better accuracy has not
been shown to correlate with improvement of clinical
outcomes.
The performance of PET/CT with new tracers (PSMA and
fluciclovine) as indicators of treatment efficacy and as
predictors of patient outcome has yet to be assessed. PSMA
PET/CT should be interpreted with caution since there are
data suggesting correlation between PSMA expression and
AR signalling [112–117]. Tumour foci not expressing PSMA
(or lesions in organs with high PSMA expression, eg, liver)
may not be assessable for response using PSMA PET/CT.
Notably, other tumour types (eg, lung cancer, renal cell
cancer) and nonmalignant processes like Paget’s disease
and haemangioma can express PSMA [118,119].
The use of these next-generation imaging modalities
may be especially valuable in situations where the tumour
burden assessments are needed for treatment decisions
and/or when high sensitivity is a requirement. This may be
particularly applicable when multimodality salvage thera-
py is being considered. However, the proof that their use
leads to better treatment decisions and ultimately leads to
improved outcomes is pending also in this situation.
For evaluation of response in men with mCRPC it is
evident that next-generation imaging (MRI and PET) may
prove to be more accurate for evaluating response to
treatment [120]. However, it should be noted that the
recently published PCWG3 do not recommend the routine
use of next-generation imaging methods for men with APC
treated on clinical trials mainly due to the lack of
availability, outcome data, and standardisation across
global sites [109]. The recently published guideline on
reporting WB-MRI in men with APC is a step into the right
direction but these recommendations need to be adopted,
applied, and validated in clinical trials with primary
endpoint of clinical outcome [88]. As an example, the
systematic evaluation of FDG-PET studies in patients with
Hodgkin’s disease has resulted in a reduction in treatment
intensity leading to reduction of toxicity [121]. Such trials
with next-generation imaging are largely missing in men
with APC [122].
The clinical introduction of potentially impactful imag-
ing technologies has created an opportunity for progress by
linking anatomy to underlying biology but there is also a
risk of up-staging of many men in every disease state. The
contribution of the next-generation imaging techniques to
the welfare of patients depends on performance for the
purpose they are being applied (‘‘fit for use’’) and their
clinical utility (patient benefit). The early assessment of
new technologies is therefore encouraged but their general
acceptance before measures of performance and evidence
of benefit are at least estimated should not be supported.
Novel imaging techniques should be clinically deployed
ideally in a trial setting but at least in registries with the
goal of efficiently estimating performance and utility.
Finally, it is important to recognise that the clinical trials
that form the basis of the currently approved treatment
options are based on evaluations with CT and bone
scintigraphy.
7.
Use of osteoclast-targeted therapy for SRE/SSE
prevention for mCRPC (not for osteoporosis/bone loss)
In prostate cancer, two bone-directed agents, zoledronic
acid and denosumab have been shown to prevent or delay
the onset of SREs. Neither of the drugs influences OS or PFS
significantly [123,124].
Of the bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid is the only one
that has shown a protective effect against SRE in patients
with mCRPC [124,125]. Denosumab is a fully human
monoclonal antibody that specifically targets receptor
activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand thus effectively
inhibiting osteoclast function and bone resorption. In the
setting of mCRPC, denosumab (120 mg subcutaneous every
4 wk) compared with zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenous
every 4 wk) significantly improved the time to first SRE
[123].
At the present time, these agents have proven relevant
efficacy only in patients with bone mCRPC. There is no
evidence to support their use in the nonmetastatic CRPC
setting and there is evidence not to use it in the mCNPC
setting apart from osteoporosis prevention, using a different
regimen, and dosage for both drugs [43,126,127].
When looking at SSE, two prospective randomised
studies in men with mCRPC demonstrated an advantage.
The TRAPEZE study showed a significant delay in SSEs when
docetaxel was combined with zoledronic acid as compared
with docetaxel alone and that the combination was safe, but
there was no improvement in OS [128]. Interestingly, the
benefit in delaying SSEs was in the same range as what was
seen in the pivotal zoledronic acid study when chemother-
apy was not in use. Also, the recent analysis of the large
pivotal denosumab trial confirmed a benefit in preventing
SSEs [129]. Hypothesis-generating results have been pre-
sented from the ALSYMPCA trial where the subgroup of
patients receiving a combination of radium-223 plus an
osteoclast
targeted
therapy
had
a
reduction
in
SSE
compared with radium-223 alone [72,130].
In an era of life prolonging therapies for mCRPC that can
also prevent or delay SREs, the added benefit of osteoclast[36_TD$DIF]-
targeted therapy is difficult to estimate given the limited
number of well designed, adequately powered studies with
long term follow-up.
Regarding the frequency of administration of these bone-
directed agents a recent randomised trial in different tumour
types also including 689 men with prostate cancer showed
no increased riskofskeletal eventswithzoledronicacid every
12 wk compared with every 4 wk [131]. However, the
proportion of patients with CNPC versus CRPC is not reported
and both were accrued tothe trial. No firm conclusions can be
made from this trial because of this variable.
For reducing the risk of skeletal complications in men with
mCRPC and bone metastases, 86% of the panel were in favour of
some form of osteoclast-targeted therapy, 54% of the panel
voted for denosumab, 8% voted for zoledronic acid, 24% of the
panellists voted for either zoledronic acid or denosumab, and
10% did not vote for an osteoclast-targeted therapy at all.
Of those panellists who voted for an osteoclast-targeted
therapy in men with mCRPC, 68% voted for a treatment
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
196
 duration of about 2 yr and 32% voted for no limitation of
treatment duration.
The question of frequency and duration of osteoclast-
targeted therapy in the absence of significant toxicity for
asymptomatic men with mCRPC and bone metastases
responding to first-line systemic mCRPC treatment is not
resolved.
In the subset of panellists who voted for osteoclast-targeted
therapy in men responding to first-line mCRPC therapy, 17% of
the panellists voted for every 4 wk without a defined
maximum duration, 37% voted for every 4 wk for approxi-
mately 2 yr and then less frequently, 15% voted for every 3 mo,
and 27% of the panel did not vote for an osteoclast-targeted
therapy in this situation. In the same patient population, but
when these men are no longer responding to first-line therapy,
27% of the panellists voted for osteoclast-targeted therapy
every 4 wk without a defined maximum duration and 53% of
the panel voted for every 4 wk for about 2 yr and then less
frequently.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a possible severe side
effect of osteoclast-targeted therapy that increases with the
duration of treatment [132,133]
In men with mCRPC who develop ONJ while on osteoclast-
targeted therapy, there was consensus (84%) to discontinue
osteoclast-targeted therapy permanently while 16% of the
panellists voted for discontinuation of the osteoclast-targeted
therapy and restarting after complete wound healing.
7.1.
Discussion of the use of osteoclast-targeted therapy for
SRE/SSE prevention for mCRPC
The optimal timing, schedule, and duration for osteoclast-
targeted therapy and the overall balance of benefit and risk
as well as efficacy in the era of novel mCRPC treatments are
still a matter of debate as there is no Level I evidence to
guide decision making.
Effective osteoclast inhibitors are commonly recom-
mended as part of the overall therapeutic approach to
mCRPC also in an era of multiple life prolonging agents.
Their use in combination with approved life prolonging
mCRPC treatments may enhance their utility in terms of
reducing the risk for of skeletal complications and to
maintain quality of life—but these data have been derived
from posthoc and subgroup analyses and need to be
addressed in prospective clinical trials. In daily clinical
practice, the risk of side effects—especially ONJ—which
increases with duration of therapy, by the early use of
osteoclast-targeted therapy for men with mCRPC has to be
weighed up against the potential benefit of reduction in risk
of SRE/SSE [133].
8.
Molecular characterisation
8.1.
Tumour biopsy in APC
Since clinical heterogeneity is common, mCRPC tumour
biopsies
should
be
reviewed
and
interpreted
in
the
appropriate clinical context. This is especially important
for uncommon yet challenging cases with small cell or
neuroendocrine differentiation or tumours that lack ex-
pression of classical prostate markers such as PSA or AR.
Furthermore, not all patients with clinical features sugges-
tive of androgen independence demonstrate small cell or
neuroendocrine features on tumour biopsy although they
may still benefit from platinum based chemotherapy. These
data may potentially be explained by molecular overlap
with neuroendocrine prostate cancer [81,134].
Moving forward, incorporating molecular biomarkers
will likely improve the clinical diagnosis of non-AR driven
mCRPC and may help in patient selection for current
therapies and selection for biomarker stratified clinical
trials [134–140]. Genomic alterations enriched in mCRPC
with emerging prognostic and/or treatment implications
include AR gene mutation and amplification, phosphoinosi-
tide 3-kinase/Akt/phosphatase and tensin homolog path-
way alterations, DNA repair defects including loss of
homologous
recombination
(eg,
BRCA1/2,
ATM),
and
mismatch repair (with microsatellite instability [MSI] and
hyper-mutated phenotype), TP53 deletion/mutation, and
RB1 loss [134,140–144]. Alterations involving RB1 and TP53
are universal in small cell cancers arising elsewhere in the
body, such as[15_TD$DIF] lung cancer, and are enriched in prostate
cancer patients with luminal to basal cell lineage switching
and neuroendocrine biomarker expression and are mecha-
nistically
involved
in
the
development
of
‘‘androgen
indifferent’’ resistance [136,139,140,143].
The panel voted on molecular factors that should be
reported in a tumour biopsy in men with mCRPC apart from
reporting tumour morphology (Table 10).
There was a consensus (78%) that BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM
mutations should be reported because that knowledge will
likely influence management decisions. For all other factors
there was no consensus (Table 10).
8.2.
Androgen receptor splice variant-7 and AR amplification/
mutation
Using liquid biopsies in mCRPC patients starting abirater-
one or enzalutamide, statistically significant associations
with worse outcome have been reported for detection of AR
splice variants including the AR-V7 transcripts in circulat-
ing cells or in exosomes, AR-V7 protein in the circulating
tumor cell nucleus, or by analysing plasma cell-free DNA AR
gene copy number gain assessed via cell-free DNA or
somatic point mutations similarly quantified [145–150]. All
studies to date were single-arm trials, and statistically
significant associations with response were noted—al-
though the correlation with response has focused largely
on rates of PSA declines. Moreover, evidence remains that
some men with AR-V7 positive mCRPC may still respond to
abiraterone/enzalutamide.
There was a consensus (96%) not to use AR-V7 testing in
daily routine clinical practice for the majority of men with
mCRPC. Similarly, there was a consensus (92%) not to use cell-
free DNA AR amplification and AR mutation testing in daily
routine clinical practice for the majority of men with mCRPC.

 8.3.
Somatic mutations
Recent genomic studies of metastatic prostate cancer have
identified new molecular targets in the AR signalling
pathway, phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway, WNT path-
way, cell cycle pathways, and perhaps most importantly, in
DNA repair pathways [135,141,151].
Fifty-nine percent of the panellists did not vote for DNA
sequencing of tumour biopsies in the majority of men with
mCRPC in routine daily clinical practice, 37% of the panellists
voted for a targeted/panel sequencing approach, and 4% voted
for whole genome or exome sequencing.
8.4.
DNA repair testing in daily routine clinical practice
Recent studies have shown that men with APC commonly
have somatic aberrations of genes that make up various
elements of the DNA repair machinery with 20–30% of APCs
having loss of function of proteins implicated in homolo-
gous recombination repair, including BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM,
PALB2,
and
others
[141].
These
aberrations
lead
to
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) detectable
by next-generation sequencing of these genes or of the
genomic scars resulting from this repair defect estimated as
an HRD score. A clinical trial (TOPARP) of the PARP inhibitor,
olaparib, has shown antitumour activity against prostate
cancers with HRD [142].
HRD defects have been previously reported to sensitise
tumour cells to platinum-based chemotherapy [152]. Clini-
cal data are now emerging that HRD defects in prostate
cancers also sensitise to platinum-based chemotherapy
[153] in keeping with previous reports that satraplatin has
antitumour activity against this disease [76,154].
Somatic deleterious aberrations of mismatch repair
genes (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2) have been found in
APC, and are possibly associated with ductal pathology,
although their precise frequency remains uncertain and is
in the range of 5% to 15% [144,155,156].
8.4.1.
DNA repair defects in CNPC
The presence of DNA repair defects (germline or somatic) in men
with newly diagnosed mCNPC does not change the standard
treatment recommendation for 49% of the panel. Twenty-three
percent of the panellists were more likely to give docetaxel in
addition to ADT and 22% of the panel were more likely to include
a platinum agent in the chemo-hormonal treatment regimen.
8.4.2.
DNA repair defects in mCRPC
When testing for DNA repair defects was considered for men
with mCRPC, and no recent mCRPC tissue biopsy tissue was
available, 70% of the subset of panellists who supported testing
in this situation voted for a fresh mCRPC tumour biopsy, 16% of
the panellists voted for testing in archival tissue, and 14% voted
for testing in circulating cell-free DNA.
Sixty-five percent of the panel voted for treatment with
olaparib, or another PARP inhibitor if available and approved,
in men with mCRPC and the presence with DNA repair defects
(germline or somatic) based on the phase 2 data with olaparib,
29% of the panel voted for such treatment in a minority of
selected patients and 4% did not vote for it at all.
Some panel members voted that it was appropriate to
extrapolate the phase 2 data from olaparib to platinum agents
for men with mCRPC and presence of DNA repair defects
(germline or somatic): 45% in the majority of patients and 14%
in a minority of selected patients; however 35% of the panellists
did not support this extrapolation.

8.5.
Discussion of molecular characterisation
Given men with mCRPC are surviving longer, and with
several treatment options available, biopsies of metastatic
lesions are more commonly pursued to rule out small cell
carcinoma, an aggressive variant, or a second malignancy.
But the real place for metastases biopsy remains unclear in
everyday practice. With a multitude of potential predictive
and prognostic markers that can be tested in a mCRPC
tumour biopsy, it is important to provide some guidance. As
of March 2017, there was only consensus from the panel for
testing of BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM mutations in mCRPC
tissue.
Several registration trials are now being conducted with
different PARP inhibitors for men with APC and evidence of
DNA repair defects (eg, NCT02952534, NCT02975934,
NCT02854436,
NCT03012321)
and
in
the
absence
of
approved PARP inhibitors for mCRPC, enrolment of men
in clinical trials is strongly recommended.
Additionally, there are also prospective trials of plati-
num-based
therapy
ongoing
in
men
with
advanced
molecularly selected prostate cancers, which may demon-
strate that this is an important therapeutic strategy for this
subgroup of patients (eg, NCT02598895, NCT02311764,
NCT02955082).
Although true MSI is rare in prostate cancer, its presence
is important because MSI+ cancers have a high rate of
durable responses to immune checkpoint blockade using
drugs
that
block
the
programmed
cell
death-1/pro-
grammed death-ligand 1 interaction [157]. Based on
149 patients with MSI-H or dMMR cancers enrolled across
five uncontrolled, multi-cohort, multi-center, single-arm
clinical trials pembrolizumab has been approved by the
FDA for use in MSI high and dMMR cancer patients
regardless of histology. This approval is of clear interest to
clinicians and to[16_TD$DIF] patients with prostate cancer and[37_TD$DIF]
evidence of these alterations.
Although a proportion of the panel voted for using a
PARP inhibitor or platinum-based chemotherapy in mCRPC,
even in the first-line setting, there is no evidence that such a
strategy is of advantage as compared with the standard
approved mCRPC treatments to date. Therefore, in the
absence of prospective randomised trials showing clinical
benefit for a strategy using a PARP-inhibitor or a platinum-
based chemotherapy, the use of these substances as first-
line mCRPC treatment outside of clinical trials should not be
generally recommended.
For the liquid biomarkers, namely AR-V7 and AR
mutation or amplification, there was a consensus that
currently none of these markers should be tested in routine
practice for decision making. This consensus against testing
is in part based upon the low detection levels of AR-V7 prior
to first- and second-line therapies and the high probability
that patients would receive abiraterone or enzalutamide in
this situation. These tests need to be validated and further
studies need to be performed to determine their impact on
long-term outcomes.

Germline genetic counselling/testing
The aetiology of prostate cancer is not well understood,
although epidemiological studies demonstrating a conver-
gence of incidence rates in some populations migrating
between areas with a low incidence to those with high
incidence suggest environmental and lifestyle risk factors
play a role [158]. Having a positive family history and/or a
certain ethnic background such as Afro-Caribbean is a risk
factor for prostate cancer development. Evidence from
studies where monozygotic twins were compared with
dizygotic twins suggest that 57% of the risk of prostate
cancer prostate cancer is due to genetic factors [159]. Nu-
merous studies of risks to relatives of prostate cancer cases
show a higher relative risk of developing prostate cancer,
which increases as the age of the proband decreases, and the
number of affected relatives increases. First degree relatives
of prostate cancer patients have twice the risk of developing
the disease compared with the general population [160]. In
men diagnosed under the age of 60 yr, the risk to their first
degree relatives is more than fourfold that of those without
a family history [161]. The variation in incidence according
to ethnicity also suggests a genetic component; rates are
higher in African American men compared with Asian-
American men [162].
Studies of familial inheritance and segregation analyses
have proposed various genetic models (autosomal domi-
nant, recessive, and X-linked) [163]. It is now recognised
that genetic predisposition to prostate cancer is composed
of common (>[1_TD$DIF]5%) lower risk variants single nucleotide
polymorphisms—most of which are not in coding regions
and rare higher risk variants (coding mutations in genes).
Over 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with
the development of prostate cancer have been identified
thus far [164].
Rarer variants are those which have a minor allele
frequency of <5%, and occur too infrequently to be detected
on a genome-wide association study. Next-generation
sequencing of targeted areas or whole genome/exome
sequencing has enabled the detection of these rare variants.
Results showed that men from families where females had
developed breast and ovarian cancer caused by BRCA
mutations have a five-fold relative risk of prostate cancer
when they harbour a germline BRCA2 mutation compared
with men without a mutation. This relative risk increases to
up to seven-fold if the men in the family develop prostate
cancer below the age of 65 yr [165]. In a larger study,
2000 men with prostate cancer were screened. This showed
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
199
 that just over 1% of men who developed prostate cancer
below the age of 65 yr carried a deleterious BRCA2 mutation
and often they did not have a positive family history
[166]. For men who are carriers of a BRCA1 mutation, studies
have shown that there is an approximately four-times
relative risk of developing prostate cancer for men aged
under 65 yr compared with those without the mutation
[167]. It has been subsequently shown in men with a family
history of at least three cases of prostate cancer that they
have a germline mutation in DNA repair genes in 7.3% and
that the disease was more likely to be aggressive [168].
Several groups have shown that BRCA1 and BRCA2
mutation carriers have a more aggressive form of prostate
cancer and also have a worse prognosis [169,170]. Mutation
carriers are also likely to present with a higher risk of local
nodal involvement as well as with distant metastatic
disease [171]. The optimal radical treatment option for
these patients is yet to be determined, but RP may be the
most suitable, although the numbers of patients studied are
relatively small [172].
Remarkably, germline mutations have been found in
about half of the men with tumour HR DNA repair gene
defects and about one in five men with an mismatch repair
DNA repair gene defect [141,173]. In a large multi-
institutional study of almost 700 men with metastatic
prostate cancer unselected for age or family history, 11.8%
overall were found to have moderate or high penetrance
germline mutations in one of 16 DNA repair genes, with 7.8%
of mutations in BRCA2, BRCA1, and ATM [173]. Two large
single-institution studies of metastatic prostate cancer found
similar rates of germline BRCA2, BRCA1, and ATM mutations,
with much lower rates in low risk indolent disease [174,175].
Regarding genetic counselling and testing for men with
newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, 20% of the panel
voted to do it in a majority of patients: 62% of the panel voted in
favour of genetic counselling/testing in a minority of selected
patients and 18% did not vote to do it at all.
The subset of panellists who had voted for genetic testing in
a minority of selected patients supported genetic counselling
and testing in men with a positive family history for prostate
cancer (95%); also, 93% of these panellists supported counsel-
ling/testing in men with a positive family history for other
cancer syndromes (eg, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
syndrome and/or pancreatic cancer or Lynch syndrome).
Further, 74% of these panellists voted for genetic counselling
and testing in men with prostate cancer diagnosed at �60 yr
but 26% of these panellists did not vote for genetic counselling
and testing based on an age cut-off alone.
Among the subset of panellists who recommended genetic
testing, 61% voted for large panel testing including homologous
recombination and mismatch DNA repair (eg, comprehensive
cancer risk assessment panels), 15% voted for BRCA1 and
BRCA2 testing only, 15% voted for BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM
testing, and 9% voted for large panel testing including
homologous recombination DNA repair (eg, panels that are
also used to assess breast cancer risk).
There was a consensus (92%) that in the presence of a
germline BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM mutation a prophylactic RP
was not recommended.
The panel was asked whether the presence of a germline
BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM mutation would influence their
treatment decision in men with low-risk localised prostate
cancer. Forty-five percent voted against active surveillance in
these patients, 35% voted for standard treatment options
(including active surveillance), and 20% voted for another
treatment option.
The panel was asked whether the presence of a germline
BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM mutation would influence their
treatment decision in men with intermediate- or high-risk
localised prostate cancer. Fifty-two percent of the panel voted
for a RP over RT, 44% of the panel voted for standard
recommendations, and 4% voted for RT over a RP.
9.1.
Discussion of germline genetic counselling/testing
The understanding of the role of genetics in prostate cancer
development is evolving rapidly, which is reflected by the
fact that 20% of the panellists recommended genetic
counselling and testing in a majority of men with metastatic
prostate cancer irrespective of family history. Age at
diagnosis itself does not seem to be the best selection
marker, but 74% of the panel who recommended genetic
counselling and testing in selected patients would test in
men aged �60 yr. The impact of a BRCA2 germline mutation
on the management in an otherwise healthy man is not
clear and in the absence of any prospective data there was a
consensus not to recommend prophylactic RP in such men.
Currently, for prostate cancer care providers ordering
germline genetic cancer panel testing or ordering this
testing in the near future, there are several important points
to consider including which genes to test for. There are
emerging prostate cancer practice recommendations only
for BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM mutations, yet most next-
generation sequencing cancer panels include many more
DNA repair genes for the same cost. There are currently no
gene-specific data on treatment predication or prostate
cancer risk for most DNA repair genes. Germline genetic
testing should be ordered with adequate pretest and/or
posttest genetic counselling. In particular, there is a need to
counsel about the possibility of a variant of uncertain
significance (VUS) being detected and/or a pathogenic
mutation in a gene in which there are not adequate data to
alter management for prostate cancer. Patients with VUS
should be managed the same as patients with a negative
test result, and there is a danger that in daily practice VUS
may be misinterpreted as a positive result. The question of
testing of family members is unanswered and screening
recommendations if mutations are detected need to be
generated. There are data suggesting earlier PSA screening
in men with BRCA2 and potentially also in men with BRCA1
germline mutations [176]. More data are needed to
appropriate counsel unaffected male family members about
prostate cancer risk and make screening recommendations.
Large
collaborative
efforts
are
underway
(eg,
NCT00261456, PRACTICAL consortium) to address some
of the open questions. However, in order to move the field
forward more efforts are needed to collaborate—especially
on prostate cancers with germline mutations that occur at a
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
200
 low frequency. The panel recommends to be especially
careful (not overinterpret) about treatment recommenda-
tions based on germline mutations in men with localised
prostate cancer.
10.
Side effects of systemic treatment: prevention,
management, and supportive care
A substantial proportion of men with APC will die of a
noncancer-related cause and must live with the acute and
chronic side effects of treatment. Most men with localised
prostate cancer do not die of their disease, but will spend
the rest of their lives managing the effects of the treatment
they have undergone. The wishes of our patients and their
families are clear: they wish to be cured of their disease or to
have their survival prolonged, but not necessarily at the cost
of intolerable side effects of treatment. Sometimes it is easy
to lose sight of this goal in the search for better oncological
outcomes.
One-hundred percent of the panel believed that there was at
least moderate evidence that ADT increases the risk of bone loss
and/or fractures; 87% believed this evidence was strong.
Baseline measurement of vitamin D for men with prostate
cancer starting on ADT was voted for in the majority of patients
by 43% of the panellists, in a minority of patients by 26% and
31% of the panellists did not vote for it.
Routine supplementation of calcium and vitamin D for men
with prostate cancer starting on ADT was voted for by 73% of
the panel, only of vitamin D by 13%, only calcium by 2%, and
12% of the panel did not vote for routine supplementation.
A baseline measurement of bone mineral density in men
with prostate cancer starting on ADT was voted for by 62% of
the panellists in the majority of patients, by 15% only in patients
with nonmetastatic disease and 21% did not vote for it at all.
Drug therapy to prevent bone loss and/or fractures with
denosumab or a bisphosphonate in the dose and schedule for
osteoporosis prophylaxis in men with prostate cancer starting
on ADT was voted for in the majority of patients by 16% of the
panellists,
by
70%
of
panellists
only
in
patients
with
documented osteopenia or osteoporosis, and 12% did not vote
for it.
Thirty-five percent of the panellists felt that there is strong
evidence that ADT increases the risk of diabetes, 46% felt that
there is moderate, and 17% that there is weak evidence for this
correlation. Two[38_TD$DIF] percent believe that ADT does not change the
risk of diabetes.
For cardiovascular disease, 12% of the panellists felt that
there is strong evidence that ADT increases the risk, 39% felt
that there is moderate, and 45% that there is weak evidence for
this correlation. Four[38_TD$DIF] percent believe that ADT does not change
the risk of cardiovascular disease.
A history of recent/severe cardiovascular disease influenced
the choice of ADT in men with metastatic prostate cancer for
29% of the panellists in the majority of patients, for 41% of the
panellists for a minority of selected patients, and for 28% of the
panellists it did not influence their choice of ADT.
For the subset of panellists whose decisions was influenced
by a history of recent/severe cardiovascular disease, 11% voted
for using LHRH agonists, 52% for use of LHRH antagonists, 6%
for orchiectomy, 20% for any form of intermittent ADT, and 11%
voted for bicalutamide 150 mg/d in such a patient.
Eight[38_TD$DIF] percent of the panellists believed that there is strong
evidence that ADT increases the risk of cognitive changes and/
or dementia, 29% felt that there is moderate, and 50% that there
is weak evidence for this correlation. Thirteen[38_TD$DIF] percent believe
that ADT does not change the risk of cognitive changes and/or
dementia.
For depression, 6% of the panellists believed that there is
strong evidence that ADT increases the risk, 46% felt that there
is moderate, and 44% that there is weak evidence for this
correlation. Four[38_TD$DIF] percent believe that ADT does not change the
risk of depression.
A multidisciplinary management team can include the
necessary expertise to deal with these issues [177]. Im-
proved
outcomes
are
apparent
with
involvement
of
prostate cancer nurses and care coordinators. Endocrinol-
ogists and andrologists can provide advice on the manage-
ment
of
diabetes,
metabolic
syndrome,
bone
health,
cardiovascular, and sexual health. Psychologists can provide
support for the common problems of suicidal risk, distress,
and long-term psychological and sexual morbidity [178–
181]. The exercise physiologist can provide programs to
counteract the effects of ADT, improve psychological
symptoms,
and
improve
overall
and
disease-specific
survival [182–184]. The direct provider of care for men
with APC can also learn such skills.
Comprehensive geriatric assessment has been shown to
be associated with a higher probability of completing a
treatment course, fewer modifications of treatment, and
lower toxicity [185,186].
Routine involvement of a multidisciplinary/multiprofes-
sional team for prevention or management of ADT related
adverse effects was voted for by 42% of the panellists for the
majority of patients, by 39% in a minority of selected patients,
and 17% did not vote for it.
Sixty-one percent of the panellists voted for early access to
an expert in symptom palliation or a dedicated palliative care
service and 39% of the panellists did not vote for it.
There was consensus (94% of the panellists) for access to
opiate pain medication for men with metastatic prostate
cancer and severe pain when lower level pain medication is not
sufficient.
Thirty[38_TD$DIF] percent of the panellists voted for a health status
assessment in men with APC �70 yr before treatment decision
in the majority of patients, 42% voted for it in a minority of
selected patients, and 24% did not vote for it.
The subset of panellists who voted for a health status
assessment voted for comprehensive geriatric assessment in
26%, G8 and Mini-COG in 29%, G8 alone in 30%, and another tool
in 15%.
There was consensus (98% of the panellists) for regular
physical exercise in men with prostate cancer starting on ADT.
10.1.
Discussion of side effects of systemic treatment:
prevention, management, and supportive care
The aging population of men with APC is now surviving
longer, allowing longer-term complications of treatment to
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 3 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 1 7 8 – 2 1 1
201
 become apparent and to affect function and symptoms. The
evidence that ADT negatively impacts bone health and the
attendant risk for fractures is considered strong by a
majority of the panel. ADT has also been associated with an
increased risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and
sarcopenia; however, evidence linking ADT directly as a
cause of vascular disease is weak and there is no convincing
evidence that ADT is linked causally to the development of
dementia as reflected in the vote of the panellists [187–
196]. Men should be informed about the acute but also the
long-term side effects of ADT and importantly the possible
preventive measures.
Interestingly, there was no consensus for the routine
assessment of health status in men aged 70 yr, likely based
on the fact that there are no large prospective clinical trials
[39_TD$DIF]which have shown that using health status assessment in
men with metastatic prostate cancer has a relevant impact
on outcome, especially when compared with the judgement
of experienced physicians. This recommendation could also
reflect a lack of consensus on what would constitute such a
‘‘health status assessment.’’ Finally, there is a need for
clinical trials and registration studies specifically in this
patient population.
11.
Global access to prostate cancer drugs and
treatment in countries with limited resources
The panel voted on a number of questions regarding
treatment options in men with APC in lower and middle-
income countries (LMIC) because the topic of global access
to APC treatments was discussed at APCCC 2017.
If living in a country with limited resources available for
health care, 90% of the panellists voted for orchiectomy as ADT
in the metastatic setting. The remaining 10% voted for an LHRH
agonist.
As second-line endocrine manipulations in LMIC in men
with mCRPC progressing on ADT, 44% of the panellists voted
for a first generation AR antagonist, 24% for steroid mono-
therapy, 20% for ketoconazole, 8% for oestrogens, and 4% for
estramustine.
Each of the following drugs is on the World Health
Organization (WHO) essential medicines list and/or they
can be sourced at
an affordable
price from generic
manufacturer. The panel voted on appropriate treatment
options in the setting of limited health care resources in
men with mCRPC who are progressing on or after docetaxel:
77% of the panellists voted for a platinum, 19% did not vote for
it. Mitoxantrone was voted for by 69% of the panellists. Thirty-
nine percent voted for the use of cyclophosphamide, 53% did
not. There was a consensus not to use paclitaxel (78%) or
doxorubicin (84%) in this situation.
11.1.
Discussion of global access to prostate cancer drugs and
treatment in countries with limited resources
Prostate cancer generally is more common in higher income
countries, but this is changing as men in LMIC live longer,
due to better control of infectious disease and other causes
of early mortality. Men in LMIC tend to present with more
advanced disease and access to the survival prolonging
agents for mCRPC is limited for many men in LMIC.
Although the panel recommended orchiectomy as first
choice of ADT in men presenting with metastatic prostate
cancer, the socio-cultural and psychological barriers to such
an intervention must be taken into consideration in such
treatment decisions.
As secondary hormonal treatment option for men with
mCRPC, endocrine manipulations including glucocorticoids,
oestrogens, first generation androgen receptor inhibitors,
and ketoconazole are available and the panel considered
especially first-generation AR inhibitors a valid treatment
option in LMIC.
Abiraterone and enzalutamide are examples of high-cost
drugs with limited access in LMIC. Both drugs were
developed substantially through research in academic
laboratories and cancer centres. In the USA, approved doses
are marketed at �US$ 7000/mo, while publicly funded
health systems such as Britain and Canada have been able to
negotiate a substantially lower price of �$3000/mo. Generic
abiraterone (but not enzalutamide) is available in India for
about $450/mo, which is, however, still too expensive for
many men with mCRPC in India.
The following drugs which have shown some antitumour
activity but no OS benefit in men with mCRPC and are on the
WHO
essentials
medicine
list:
carboplatin,
paclitaxel,
doxorubicin,
and
cyclophosphamide.
Carboplatin
was
recommended by a majority of the panellists. Mitoxantrone
is not on the WHO essentials medicine list but has shown a
pain palliation benefit and could be sourced at a reasonable
price. Many of these drugs are substantially cheaper than
the approved and survival prolonging agents for mCRPC and
they can be used sometimes as substitutes for newer agents
in LMIC. While this is a reasonable strategy, it falls far short
of the ideal of providing the most effective treatments to all
men with APC.
A major goal of this consensus conference is to improve
the management and outcomes of men with APC. However,
it is a suboptimal clinical achievement to show that new
treatments can improve the duration and quality of survival
of men with APC, but to have such treatments unavailable to
a large segment of the global population of men with APC.
The availability of RT as a very effective bone pain palliation
therapy is not given in many countries. We cannot easily
change the way that drugs are developed and marketed for
profit by academic, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology
companies, and we certainly respect and collaborate within
this system for the development of needed new treatments
for men with APC. But men with APC are still unable to
access optimal treatments, oftentimes not because they
could not be made available, but because they are not made
available at an affordable price. Hence, we encourage
ongoing multidisciplinary and stakeholder dialogue to
further address this global issue.

 data, weighted [40_TD$DIF]expert opinions can be helpful for treatment
decisions in daily routine clinical practice. It is important to
note that [40_TD$DIF]expert opinion is not equivalent to high-level
evidence and that current [40_TD$DIF]expert consensus may be
disproven by future clinical research.
There were several notable areas of consensus in APCC
2017 as summarised in Figure 1.
There were also several notable areas of panellist
disagreement including but not limited to: (1) chemo-
hormonal therapy in ‘‘low-volume’’ CNPC, (2) treatment of
the primary tumour in metastatic disease, (3) radium-223
combination strategies, (4) use of platinum in mCRPC, (5)
definition of aggressive variant prostate cancer, (6) use,
schedule, and duration of osteoclast-targeted therapies
especially in the context of newer survival prolonging
mCRPC therapies; (7) use of next-generation imaging; (8)
how to advise men with known BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM
mutations; (9) adjuvant RT; (10) when to initiate SRT; (11)
definition and treatment for oligometastatic synchronous
and metachronous prostate cancer; (12) health status
assessment in patients aged �70 yr; and (13) pathology
reporting of men undergoing a mCRPC biopsy.

 interventions. A problem arising from the widespread
initiation of unvalidated techniques and treatments is that
they achieve a clinical momentum, which makes it very
difficult to conduct effective comparative studies. The panel
strongly recommends participation in clinical research to
inform clinical management with high-level evidence.
Important research areas are adjuvant and salvage treat-
ment; diagnosis and treatment of oligometastatic disease;
molecular characterisation; personalised therapy strate-
gies; and supportive care including the impact of geriatric
assessment and specific interventions.
We urgently need public and/or charity funding to carry
out studies in areas such as surgery, RT, or imaging where
financial support from industry is commonly not available.
Additional relevant questions remain that we were not
able to address in detail in this meeting such as costs and
cost-effectiveness of drugs, health economic issues, and
patient-reported outcomes. APCCC 2019 plans to address
these questions and the above-mentioned areas of contro-
versy and new emerging topics.
