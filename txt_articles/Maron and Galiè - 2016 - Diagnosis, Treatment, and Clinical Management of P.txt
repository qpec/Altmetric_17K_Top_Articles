Abstract
Importance—Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by severe remodeling of 
distal pulmonary arteries, increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular 
dysfunction that promotes heart failure. Once regarded as largely untreatable, evidence-based 
decision-making now guides clinical management of patients and improves PAH outcome. Yet, 
misconceptions regarding the approach to PAH in the modern era are common and associated with 
substandard clinical care.
Observations—The clinical profile of PAH has changed substantially since its original 
description: the age at diagnosis is older than previously reported, disease severity appears greater 
in men compared to women, and PAH in association with connective tissue disease is identified as 
a particularly high risk patient subgroup. Risk stratification scales for PAH are now available at 
point of care, which inform treatment goals including: 6-minute walk distance >440 m, peak VO2 
>15 ml/min/kg, right atrial area <18 cm2, cardiac index >2.5 l/min/m2, and absent/low symptom 
burden with routine physical activity. Currently, 14 therapies targeting six PAH-specific molecular 
intermediaries are in use clinically. Recent landmark trial data have demonstrated the critical 
importance of initial combination therapy in treatment-naïve patients. Taken together, these 
findings underscore a global shift in PAH coupling early disease detection with aggressive 
pharmacotherapy. Indeed, recent longitudinal data from combination therapy patients shows that 
the 3-year survival rate in PAH may be as high as 84% compared with 48% from the original 
National Institutes of Health registry on idiopathic PAH (1980-1985). Despite these gains, 
incomplete clinical evaluation and misdiagnosis by referring practitioners is common and 
associated with inappropriate therapy.
Conclusions and Relevance—Compared to the original clinical experience, PAH has evolved 
into a contemporary and treatable disease characterized by improved survival and a high standard 
for defining therapeutic success. However, under-awareness among clinicians regarding the

 importance of early and accurate PAH diagnosis persists and is a potentially reversible cause of 
adverse outcome in this disease.
Introduction
Twenty years ago, the first clinical trial demonstrating superiority of a disease-specific 
medical intervention in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was published based on 
findings from a small cohort of end-stage idiopathic PAH (iPAH) patients.1 In 
contradistinction to the original clinical experience, PAH has evolved into a treatable disease 
characterized by maintained quality of life and improved longevity in many patients.2 
Despite these gains, the adverse clinical event rate in PAH remains elevated. Fresh 
epidemiological and clinical trial data suggests that missed opportunity to improve outcome 
in PAH may exist by virtue of delayed diagnosis and late implementation of disease-specific 
therapy.3-5 From this perspective, the contemporary approach to PAH diagnosis, 
management, and treatment is discussed further in detail.
Demystifying the Approach to PAH Diagnosis
Pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed based on a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) 
≥25 mmHg determined by resting supine right heart catheterization (RHC).6,7 Although a 
wide spectrum of conditions promote pulmonary hypertension, PAH is characterized by 
remodeling of distal pulmonary arteries in the absence of other cardiopulmonary disease. An 
elevation in mPAP alone does not exclude left atrial hypertension or describe the disease 
severity, as pulmonary arterial pressure may be only mildly increased in the setting of end-
stage right ventricular failure. Therefore, a diagnosis of PAH is considered in mPAP ≥25 
patients with pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular 
resistance (PVR) >3.0 Wood Units.6,7 Diagnosing PAH requires exclusion of co-morbid 
cardiac, parenchymal lung, thromboembolic, and other diseases that predispose to abnormal 
cardiopulmonary hemodynamics (Figure 1).
The approach to PAH will often involve two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography, 
complete pulmonary function testing, thoracic computed tomography (CT), and nocturnal 
plethysmography to evaluate sleep disordered breathing. A ventilation/perfusion scan to 
assess for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is critical in all patients 
suspected of PAH, since this disease is curable by surgical endarterectomy in most cases and 
treatable medically or by balloon pulmonary angioplasty in patients who are poor operative 
candidates (Reviewed in detail in ref. 8).
Although iPAH is the most common PAH subgroup, serological analysis for markers of 
connective tissue disease (CTD), liver failure, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
should also be performed as results may inform a diagnosis of CTD-PAH, PAH associated 
with portal hypertension, and HIV-PAH, respectively. In patients at risk for heritable PAH 
(HPAH), screening for a mutation in BMPR-2 or other selected genes may be indicated. 
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis are rare PAH 
subgroups caused by obstructive remodeling of pulmonary venules and proliferation of 
capillaries, respectively.9 Confirming the approach to diagnosing these diseases as well as

 PAH in congenital heart disease or pediatric patients requires consultation with a qualified 
specialist (Table 1).6,7
Delayed Diagnosis in PAH is Common—Inappropriate, incomplete, and delayed 
diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is common and reported in up to 85% of at-risk 
patients.10,11 This is likely due, in part, to the high frequency of non-specific symptoms at 
presentation, such as exertional dyspnea. Nonetheless, patients with PAH on average express 
symptoms 2 years prior to diagnosis.12 Misconceptions among clinicians regarding the 
diagnostic criteria for PAH, declining utilization of RHC despite its favorable safety profile, 
and over-reliance on echocardiography despite its inadequate accuracy for measuring right 
heart hemodynamics contribute to misdiagnosis of patients.13 In one multi-center cross-
sectional analysis of patients diagnosed with PAH in community hospitals and referred to a 
quaternary specialty center, 37% of patients had not yet undergone RHC, which ultimately 
resulted in diagnosis reclassification and the identification of prescribed therapy that was 
inappropriate in 52% and 57% of the cohort, respectively.11
Novel Clues to the Clinical Spectrum of Risk in PAH—There is accumulating 
evidence to suggest that in CTD-PAH, a mPAP<25 mmHg is abnormal. For example, resting 
mPAP >17 mmHg corresponds to a significant decrease in 6-minute walk distance (6-
MWD) and peak volume of oxygen (pVO2) extraction during cardiopulmonary exercise 
testing (CPET) as compared to matched patients with mPAP <17 mmHg.14 In one study of 
mixed clinical populations that includes CTD-PAH, resting mPAP ∼20-25 mmHg was 
associated with significantly diminished exercise tolerance and a 4.8-fold increase in the 4-
yr mortality rate.15 It has been shown that increases in pulmonary arterial pressure affect 
right heart physiology in vivo by disrupting RV work distribution in favor of maintaining 
pulmonary circulatory pressure relative to blood flow (and hence oxygen transport), which is 
referred to as right ventricular-pulmonary arterial (RV-PA) uncoupling.16 However, the 
extent to which RV-PA uncoupling underpins adverse outcome in CTD-PAH with mPAP <25 
mmHg requires additional study. Additionally, comprehensive data on the utility of treating 
any patient based on mPAP <25 mmHg remain forthcoming. Nonetheless, a low clinical 
index of suspicion for PAH is warranted when encountering CTD patients irrespective of 
resting cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, and their early referral to specialty care centers is 
justified (Table 1).
New Trends in the Epidemiology of PAH—The reported prevalence of PAH is 5-25 
cases/million (incidence 2-5 cases/million), although referral bias from registry studies is 
likely to under-estimate the true rate of disease.17 The mean age of PAH patients in the 
REVEAL (U.S., 2006-2007)18 and COMPERA (Europe, 2007-)19 PAH registries was 54 
and 68 yrs, respectively, compared to 36 yrs in the original National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) iPAH cohort (1980-1985).20 On the other hand, the large variability in mean age of 
iPAH patients in contemporary registries may also be explained by participation bias among 
centers and variable accuracy in the diagnostic process. In fact, auditing for diagnostic 
accuracy is not systematic in large registries and the frequency of misclassification is 
unknown, particularly in patients with left heart disease risk factors and PAWP >12 mmHg, 
for whom adjudicating retrospectively PAH vs. pulmonary hypertension due to left heart

 disease is difficult. The prevalence of PAH favors women to men by ∼3.1-fold;21 however, 
the clinical profile, hemodynamics at diagnosis, and prognosis in men has appears 
comparatively less favorable.17,22
Natural History—The original NIH registry included mainly HPAP and iPAH, and 64% of 
patients were incident cases. The median survival was 2.8 yr; the 1- and 3-yr mortality rates 
were 68% and 48%, respectively, and the use of standard therapy at the time (digitalis, 
diuretics, or anticoagulants) likely did not influence outcome.23 In 2010, data were 
organized for 298 prevalent and 56 incident iPAH, HPAH and anorexigen-PAH patients 
followed for 3 years in the French Network on Pulmonary Hypertension.17 In that study, 
76% of patients were prescribed PAH-specific therapy, and the 1- and 3-yr survival rates 
were 85.7% and 54.9%, respectively, although only 2 patients were reported to receive ≥1 
PAH-specific therapy. However, from the REVEAL registry, which tracks PAH patients from 
54 U.S. centers, an analysis on outcome that included 40% of patients on combination PAH 
therapy indicated that the 1- and 3-yr survival rates were 91% and 69%, respectively.24 
Directionally similar findings were observed in registries from Spain, UK, and China, as 
well as a European series reporting that the 3-year survival of PAH combination patients was 
84%.25 It is notable that mortality in PAH is now akin to, or perhaps lower than, patients 
with left ventricular heart failure, for which the age-adjusted 1-yr survival was 69% in 2010 
and 67% in 1980-1989.26
Pathogenesis and Current Drug Targets in PAH
Histopathology—In PAH, effacement of distal pulmonary arteries involving the intima, 
media, and adventitial layers occurs due to hypertrophic, fibrotic, plexogenic, and 
inflammatory vascular remodeling without primary involvement of the arterial systemic 
beds. The small pulmonary veins system is also variably affected, particularly in PAH due to 
the classical form of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.27 It is now understood that in 
addition to endothelial dysfunction and dysregulated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell 
growth, pathogenic changes to the structure and function of pulmonary arterial pericytes, 
myofibroblasts, and adventitial fibroblasts also play a key role in the vascular remodeling 
process.28 Increased vascular reactive oxygen species accumulation, a shift in mitochondrial 
bioenergetics toward glycolysis, over-activation of HIF-1α signaling, and maladaptive 
epigenetic modifications that promote DNA damage are all implicated in apoptosis-
resistance, unopposed proliferation, and/or transdifferentiation of pulmonary vascular 
cells.29,30 Ultimately, profound vascular cell proliferation ensues and results in luminal 
obliteration and impaired vascular reactivity.
The Syndrome of PAH—Structural abnormalities to the alveolar-capillary interface, and 
to left atrium, and left ventricle (due to underfilling) occur as a consequence of pulmonary 
vascular remodeling in PAH. Upregulation of neurohumoral signaling in concert with 
impaired renal or hepatic function is an important systemic manifestation of PAH,31 while 
diminished strength and fiber size in volitional (e.g., quadriceps) and non-volitional (e.g., 
diaphragm) muscles is well documented and contributes to symptom burden.32

 PAH Pathophysiology and RV involvement—A predominantly vasoconstrictive 
pathophenotype is observed in only ∼10% of PAH patients.6,7 By contrast, decreased arterial 
compliance and elevations in PVR are universal across the PAH spectrum and, ultimately, 
induce RV dilation, impaired diastolic function, and diminished contractile reserve. 
Therefore, analyzing the RV is important in PAH, and includes echocardiographic 
measurement of right atrial and RV volumes, and RV function.33 In PAH, RV-PA uncoupling 
measured by transduction catheter and magnetic resonance imaging precedes frank right 
heart failure and in clinical studies corresponds to decreased exercise tolerance.34 
Interestingly, the pathophysiology of CTD-PAH appears somewhat unique, as these patients 
fail to augment RV contractility during exercise at RV afterload levels that are associated 
with maintained RV function in iPAH patients.35 Thus, RV performance differs across PAH 
subgroups, possibly as a function of disease-specific factors rather than solely by elevated 
RV afterload.
Genetics of PAH—A germline mutation coding for the bone morphogenetic receptor-2 
(BMPR-2) gene, which is part of the TGF-β superfamily of receptors, is implicated in 70% 
of HPAH and up to 40% of iPAH patients.36 Importantly, up to 80% of BMPR-2 carriers are 
“genotype positive-phenotype negative,” and, thus, the contribution of reduced penetrance to 
under recognition of BMPR-2 mutation status in PAH patients without a familial history of 
the disease is not known.37 A smaller percentage of HPAH and PAH-hereditary hemorrhagic 
telangiectasia is attributed to mutations in genes coding for other TGF-β family receptor 
proteins including ALK1, endoglin, and SMAD9. Other rarer genetic causes of PAH include 
mutations in CAV1, which regulates SMAD 2/3 and modifies TGF signaling, and KCNK3, 
which encodes for the potassium channel protein TASK-1.38 Mutations in EIF2AK4 have 
also been identified as causative of heritable pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.39
Novel Drug Therapies and Care Strategies in PAH
In the previous 5 years, three mainstream trends have emerged in the pharmacotherapeutic 
management of patients with PAH (reviewed in detail recently in ref. 40). First, the efficacy 
of phosphodiesterase type-V inhibitors (PDE-Vi), endothelin type-A and type-B receptor 
antagonists (ERA), and prostaglandin I2 replacement therapies, administered either as 
monotherapy or in sequential combination, have each achieved evidence-based validation for 
their ready use in PAH when patients are under the care of an expert pulmonary 
hypertension clinician (eFigure 1). Second, recent clinical trials show the effects of 3 novel 
PAH drug therapies: the SERAPHIN trial with macitentan (ERA),41 PATENT trial with 
riociguat (soluble guanylyl cyclase [sGC] stimulator),42 and GRIPHON trial with selexipag 
(prostaglandin I2 receptor agonist).43 Third, findings from the recent AMBITION trial mark 
a strategic shift in PAH by providing definitive evidence in favor of initial combination 
therapy over monotherapy for newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients.44
In the SERAPHIN trial, 742 PAH patients were randomized to receive placebo or macitentan 
(10 mg vs. 3 mg daily), which was a modified ERA with optimal receptor binding kinetics. 
The majority of enrolled patients had iPAH or CTD-PAH (87%), NYHA Functional Class 
II/III (97%), severe pulmonary hypertension (mPAP ∼55 mmHg, CI ∼2.3 l/min/m2, PVR 
∼12.5 Wood units), and were on some form of background PAH therapy (64%), the majority

 of which was the PDE-Vi sildenafil. Compared to placebo (mean duration of treatment 85.3 
wk), the hazard ratio for achieving the composite primary end-point of PAH-related clinical 
worsening, which included death or disease progression, was 0.70 (P=0.01) in the 3 mg dose 
arm and 0.55 (P<0.001) in the 10 mg dose arm (mean duration of treatment: 100 wk for 3 
mg arm, 104 wk for 10 mg arm). Directionally similar findings were observed for PVR and 
cardiac index at 6 months compared to baseline. However, given that the 3 mg dose was 
associated with only a subtle improvement in other study measures, only the 10 mg dose 
received approval for use clinically in the U.S. and Europe.
The PATENT-1 study compared the effect of riociguat (2.5 mg t.i.d.) or placebo on change in 
6-MWD from baseline at study week 12 in a cohort of 443 PAH patients. The majority of 
participants in PATENT-1 had iPAH (61%), NYHA Functional Class II/III (95%), and were 
already prescribed background PAH therapy (50.1%) at the time of study enrollment (mainly 
bosentan). Compared to placebo, riociguat 2.5 mg t.i.d. was associated with a significant 
increase in 6-MWD (+30 m vs. +6 m; P<0.001), decreased PVR (-2.8 vs. -0.1 Wood units; 
P<0.001) and significant improvements to mPAP, cardiac output, N-terminal pro-b-type 
natriuretic peptide, World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class, and dyspnea 
burden. Riociguat was generally well tolerated; syncope was the most common serious 
adverse event and occurred in 1% of patients.
The GRIPHON trial randomized 1156 patients from 39 countries to receive placebo (median 
duration 64 wk) or selexipag (median duration 71 wk) titrated to the maximal tolerated dose. 
The majority of patients had NYHA Functional Class II/III (98%), and iPAH/HPAP (86%) 
or PAH due to corrected congenital shunt (9.5%). Baseline PAH therapies included ERA 
(15%), PDE-Vi (32%), ERA + PDE-Vi (33%), or no drug (20%). The primary end-point of 
death or PAH complication occurred in 41.6% of placebo-treated patients and 27.0% of 
selexipag-treated patients (HR=0.6; P<0.001)(Figure 2A). The effect of therapy on 6-MWD 
was negligible, and the side effect profile of selixipag was consistent with PGI2 analogues 
(e.g., headache, diarrhea, nausea, jaw pain) corresponding to a drug discontinuation rate of 
14% due to adverse symptoms.
Strategic Shift in the Management of PAH—Meta-analyses studying sequential 
combination therapy patients suggested a signal toward superior clinical benefit among 
patients on multiple drugs compared to patients on placebo or prescribed monotherapy.45 To 
address this further, the AMBITION trial included 500 treatment-naive newly diagnosed 
participants that were randomized (2:1:1) to receive initial combination therapy with the 
selective ETA receptor antagonist ambrisentan 10 mg daily plus PDE-Vi with tadalafil 40 
mg daily or standard of care monotherapy with either drug alone. Patients in AMBITION 
were diagnosed with PAH on average 20 days prior to study drug day 1 and had NYHA 
Functional Class II/III and moderate-severe cardiopulmonary haemodynamic severity at 
enrollment. At a median of 517 d, an end-point of death, PAH hospitalization, disease 
progression, or unsatisfactory clinical response occurred in 18%, 34% and 28% of patients 
randomized to combination therapy, ambrisentan monotherapy, and tadalafil monotherapy, 
respectively. Furthermore, a 50% (P<0.001) reduction in the hazard for achieving the 
primary end-point, which was a composite of the clinical events, was observed in the 
combination therapy group compared to patients randomized to either monotherapy

 treatment (Figure 2B). Initial combination therapy was also associated with a decrease in the 
hazard for the primary end-point by 79% (P=0.005) among patients with NYHA Functional 
Class II, providing evidence in support of initial combination therapy in mildly symptomatic 
patients.
Approach to PAH Patients in Practice
Pulmonary Vasoreactivity Testing, Risk Stratification, and Initial Management 
Steps—Assessing the effect of inhaled nitric oxide, intravenous prostacyclin, or 
intravenous adenosine on cardiopulmonary hemodynamics for the purpose of determining 
vasoreactivity, and, thus, treatment should be confined primarily to HPAH, iPAH, and drug-
induced PAH and performed at a PAH referral center. A positive test is defined by a decrease 
in mPAP ≥10 mmHg to reach an mPAP ≤40 mmHg with a decrease (or no change) in 
cardiac output.6,7 In such patients, high dose calcium channel antagonism therapy is 
indicated as first-line treatment owing to relevant improved clinical outcome following 
treatment in this PAH subgroup.
Systems for classifying patients according to 1-year mortality risk are now available for use 
in clinical practice.6,7 Low (<5%/yr), intermediate (5-10%/yr), and high (>10%/yr) risk is 
determined based on a collective analysis of clinical, hemodynamic, biochemical, and 
echocardiographic data (Table 2). These and other criteria and warning signs that should 
prompt referral to a pulmonary hypertension expert center are provided in Table 1. 
Achieving low clinical risk also functions as the principle treatment goal and includes: 6-
minute walk distance >440 m, peak VO2 >15 ml/min/kg, right atrial area <18 cm2, cardiac 
index >2.5 l/min/m2.
Initiating PAH Therapy—For patients with a positive vasoreactivity study but calcium 
channel antagonist non-responder status or in patients without a positive vasoreactivity 
study, treatment selection hinges on risk level (Figure 3). According to evidence in the 
literature, it is recommended that initial combination therapy with an ERA and a PDE-Vi be 
adopted for treatment-naïve patients with low or intermediate risk, which often equates to 
NYHA Functional Class II/III status. As an alternative, monotherapy that includes an ERA, 
a PDE-Vi, a sGC stimulator or a prostacyclin analogue may be considered as initial 
treatment in low or intermediate risk patients. For patients at high risk at first clinical 
encounter, initial combination therapy including intravenous (IV) prostacyclin analogues 
should be considered, with IV epoprostenol prioritized given its favorable effect on survival 
in high-risk patients even with administered as monotherapy.1
Therapeutic Escalation—Medical assessment including 6-MWD testing should be 
evaluated every 3-6 months (at least twice annually) to observe for a decline in exercise 
status. Additional studies, such as echocardiography or RHC, are often performed at least 
annually or if indicated by a change in clinical status. Determining timing of therapeutic 
escalation is challenging, and should be tailored to individual patients. An overarching goal 
is to maintain WHO Functional Class II or I status, 6-MWD > 440 m and cardiac index ≥2.5 
l/min/m2. Therefore, if drug treatment fails to accomplish this objective within 3-6 months 
of its initiation, or if clinical decline is precipitous (≤1 WHO functional class decrease), then 
Maron and Galiè

 the addition of therapies is warranted. High-risk findings that suggest advanced RV failure, 
for example, may alter the timeline of treatment escalation.
The recently proposed strategy of initial combination therapy with oral compounds in newly 
diagnosed PAH patients in WHO functional class II and III status6,7 will leave in the future 
only one additional escalation step to reach the maximal triple combination medical therapy.
It is common practice to escalate therapy by the sequential addition of PAH-specific drugs in 
patients with progressive disease despite maximal tolerated dose of the initial treatment 
selection. The addition of macitentan to sildenafil; riociguat to bosentan; and, selexipag to 
an ERA or PDE-Vi are each 2005 ESC/ERS Guideline Class I6,7 recommendations for most 
patients, and triple medical therapy in refractory disease is increasingly common. It is 
important to note that the combination of PDE-Vi and riociguat is prohibited due to severe 
adverse events.46
Referral for lung transplant evaluation is recommended in patients prescribed maximal 
medical therapy. The preferred procedure in PAH patients is double lung transplantation; 
importantly, an inverse correlation between pre-operative frailty and post-transplant outcome 
is observed.47 The introduction of a right-to-left shunt using balloon atrial septostomy or 
Potts shunt may be a consideration to palliate the clinical sequelae of right heart failure in 
PAH, but should only be implemented on an individualized basis at referral centers expert 
with these procedures.
Prescription Exercise in PAH Treatment—Once regarded as potentially dangerous in 
PAH due to concern for provoked sudden death, exercise training has become as an 
important therapy in the management of patients. Mereles and colleagues48 first established 
prescription aerobic exercise as a safe and effective strategy to improve exercise tolerance 
and quality of life in patients with severe PAH. A recent meta-analysis of 16 prospective 
studies in PAH (N=469) showed that exercise was associated with a significant improvement 
at follow up (median 15 wk) in 6-MWD (+53.3 m), pVO2 (+1.8 ml/kg), and pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure (-3.7 mmHg).49 Generally, inspiratory muscle training that achieves 
>30% of maximal inspiratory pressure (30 min session, 1-2/d) and aerobic exercise that 
achieves 50-85% maximal aerobic capacity (30 min session, 3-7 d/wk) is recommended to 
patients.50 However, the practical application of exercise programs for a rare disease in the 
real world requires further developments and adaptations to the different healthcare systems.
Difficult Clinical Scenarios
Patients with borderline mean pulmonary arterial pressure increase—Several 
reports in unselected populations that included patients with left heart and pulmonary 
disease describe an increase in clinical risk associated with pulmonary arterial pressure 
beginning at levels classified currently as normal.52 In the largest study (N=21,727),53 a 
continuous relationship between mPAP and the adjusted hazard for all-cause mortality was 
observed beginning at 19 mmHg. Furthermore, as the range of mPAP 19-24 mmHg, was 
common and corresponded to a 23% increase in mortality risk. However, It is unknown 
whether mPAP <25 mmHg is sufficient to induce right heart pathophysiology and account 
for adverse clinical outcome in these subjects, or if events are due to co-morbid disease. 
Maron and Galiè

 Determining if this subphenotype is an early disease state has important implications on 
patient risk-stratification and merits future investigation. At present, data informing clinical 
decision-making in patients with mPAP 19-24 mmHg does not exist and, therefore, such 
patients should not be treated with PAH approved therapy.
Mixed Clinical Phenotypes—Encountering patients with multiple risk factors for left 
heart disease and with cardiopulmonary hemodynamics consistent with PAH is becoming 
common.6,7 A subgroup analysis of the AMBITION study involving PAH patients with ≥3 
risk factors for left heart disease and PAWP ≤15 mmHg suggested a signal toward clinical 
benefit. Determining the manor by which this patient subgroup contrasts with PAH (i.e., pre-
capillary PH) and bona fide left heart disease (LHD) with preserved ejection fraction 
(HFpEF), thus, bears important ramifications on PAH diagnosis and treatment. Opitz and 
colleagues54 showed that PAH patients with risk factors for left heart disease and HFpEF 
patients in the COMPERA registry were incrementally older and had greater BMI compared 
to PAH without risk factors. However, PAH patients with risk factors were treated 
commonly with PAH-specific drugs, which apparently was associated with meaningful 
improvements in functional status and 6-MWD. However, the magnitude of treatment effects 
was inferior compared to PAH patients without risk factors, outlining the potential negative 
effects of comorbidities.
On the other hand, we need to acknowledge the important limitations of the data provided by 
the COMPERA study, which is a voluntary, not systematically audited, non-interventional 
registry that, as such, cannot provide definitive results on the comparative effects of 
treatments in the studied patient groups. The differential diagnosis between iPAH with 
multiple risk factors for LHD and HFpEF with pulmonary hypertension is based 
substantially on PAWP, which is >15 mmHg in the latter clinical phenotype.6,7 The 
assessment of PAWP may present technical difficulties and artifact, which can lead to 
uncertainties in the PAWP, particularly between 12 – 18 mmHg. In cases of doubt, a direct 
assessment of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure may be helpful. Fluid challenge or 
exercise hemodynamics have been suggested in cases of persisting uncertainties, but 
unfortunately the heterogeneity of protocols and the lack of age-related normal thresholds 
for PAWP limit their diagnostic reliability. In clinical practice, the differential diagnosis in 
unclear cases should be based not only on a borderline value of PAWP, but also a 
comprehensive assessment including the history of the patient, the severity of comorbidities 
and the response to medications such as diuretics.
Conclusions
Over the preceding two decades, PAH has evolved into a treatable cardiovascular disease 
associated with improved survival and decreased morbidity. Optimizing clinical outcome 
hinges on lower clinical index of suspicion for PAH at point of care, understanding the broad 
clinical spectrum of risk, and the importance of early aggressive therapy in newly diagnosed 
patients.

 Figure 1. Classification of pulmonary hypertension subgroups
Pulmonary hypertension is defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mmHg 
measured by right heart catheterization supine at rest. Patients meeting this criterion are 
classified further according to co-morbid left heart disease causing left atrial hypertension, 
parenchymal or hypoxic lung disease, chronic thrombembolic pulmonary hypertension 
(CTEPH), or other predisposing diseases associated with pulmonary vascular remodeling. In 
the case of CTEPH, in situ thrombotic and fibrotic remodeling of subsegmental pulmonary 
arterioles occurs in most patients as a maladaptive response to prior luminal pulmonary 
embolism. By contrast to these forms of pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH) is characterized by a plexogenic, hypertrophic, and fibrotic 
vasculopathy affecting distal pulmonary arterioles that occurs primarily due to interplay 
between genetic and molecular factors and requires meeting the following additional 
cardiopulmonary hemodynamic criteria: pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) >3.0 Wood 
units and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤15 mmHg. The most common forms 
of PAH in industrialized countries are idiopathic PAH, heritable PAH due primarily to a 
mutation in the gene for bone morphogenetic protein receptor-2, and PAH in association 
with connective tissue disease (CTD) or congenital heart disease. LV, left ventricle; HIV, 
human immunodeficiency virus; PH, pulmonary hypertension; COPD, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease; HD, hemodialysis.

A. The effect of sequential combination therapy of selexipag as monotherapy or as addition 
to endothelyn receptor antagonists and/or phosphodiesterase type5 inhibitors on the 
outcome. In the GRIPHON study patients were randomised to receive selexipag or placebo. 
Kaplan–Meier curves for the primary composite end point of death (from any cause) or a 
complication related to pulmonary arterial hypertension (disease progression or worsening 
of pulmonary arterial hypertension that resulted in hospitalization, initiation of parenteral 
prostanoid therapy or long-term oxygen therapy, or the need for lung transplantation or 
balloon atrial septostomy) up to the end of the treatment period in the selexipag and placebo 
groups. A significant treatment effect in favor of selexipag versus placebo was observed 
(hazard ratio, 0.60; 99% CI, 0.46 to 0.78; P<0.001 with the use of a one-sided log-rank test).

therapy with ambrisentan plus tadalafil on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
outcome in treatment-naive patients on clinical outcome. In the AMBITION trial, 
treatment-naive PAH patients were randomized to receive monotherapy standard of care 
with the selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist ambrisentan (10 mg daily) or the 
phosphodiesterase-type V inhibitor tadalafil (40 mg daily), or combination therapy with both 
drugs. The primary end-point included first event of clinical failure, which was a composite 
of death, hospitalization for worsening pulmonary arterial hypertension, disease progression, 
or unsatisfactory long-term clinical response. The pooled monotherapy condition refers to all 
patients randomized to receive either ambrisentan alone or tadalafil alone. Reproduced from
