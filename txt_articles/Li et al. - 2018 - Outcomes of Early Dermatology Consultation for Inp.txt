IMPORTANCE Many inflammatory skin dermatoses mimic cellulitis (pseudocellulitis) and are
treated with antibiotics and/or hospitalization, leading to unnecessary patient morbidity and
substantial health care spending.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of early dermatology consultation on clinical and
economic outcomes associated with misdiagnosed cellulitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study enrolled patients with
presumed diagnosis of cellulitis in the emergency department, in the emergency department
observation unit, or within 24 hours of admission to an inpatient unit of a large urban
teaching hospital between February and September 2017. Patients were provided with
telephone and clinic follow-up during the 30-day postdischarge period. We screened 165
patients with the primary concern of cellulitis. Of these, we excluded 44 who required
antibiotics for cutaneous, soft-tissue, and deeper-tissue and/or bone infections irrespective
of cellulitis status, and 5 who were scheduled to be discharged by the emergency
department.
INTERVENTIONS Early dermatology consultation for presumed cellulitis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were patient disposition and rates of
antibiotic use.
RESULTS Of 116 patients (63 [54.3%] women; 91 [78.4%] non-Hispanic white; mean [SD] age,
58.4 [19.1] years), 39 (33.6%) were diagnosed with pseudocellulitis by dermatologists. Of
these, 34 (87.2%) had started using antibiotics for presumed cellulitis as prescribed by the
primary team at the time of enrollment. The dermatology team recommended antibiotic
discontinuation in 28 of 34 patients (82.4%), and antibiotics were stopped in 26 of 28 cases
(92.9%). The dermatologists also recommended discharge from planned observation or
inpatient admission in 20 of 39 patients with pseudocellulitis (51.3%), and the primary team
acted on this recommendation in 17 of 20 cases (85.0%). No patients diagnosed with
pseudocellulitis experienced worsening condition after discharge based on phone and clinic
follow-up (30 of 39 [76.9%] follow-up rate). Extrapolating the impact of dermatology
consultation for presumed cellulitis nationally, we estimate 97 000 to 256 000 avoided
hospitalization days, 34 000 to 91 000 patients avoiding unnecessary antibiotic exposure,
and $80 million to $210 million in net cost savings annually.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Early consultation by dermatologists for patients with
presumed cellulitis represents a cost-effective intervention to improve health-related
outcomes through the reduction of inappropriate antibiotic use and hospitalization.

ellulitis is a common infection of the dermis and subcu-
taneoustissuethatleadsto2.3millionemergencydepart-
ment(ED)visitsand650000hospitaladmissionsperyear
in the United States.1,2 Clinical similarities between cellulitis
and its mimickers (pseudocellulitis) lead to misdiagnosis rates
of 30% to 90%3-5 and result in unnecessary interventions.6-9
Our prior research has estimated that inappropriate treatment
andhospitalizationforpatientswithmisdiagnosedlowerextrem-
itycellulitismayresultinmorethan9000nosocomialinfections,
1000to5000Clostridiumdifficileinfections,and2to6casesof
anaphylaxis yearly, in addition to annual hospitalization costs
of $195 million to $515 million.10,11
Considering the clinical and economic consequences of
misdiagnosed cellulitis, potential solutions to improve diag-
nostic accuracy are needed. While prior investigations have
posited that dermatology consultation may lead to improved
outcomesinpatientswithpresumedcellulitis,theseeffortsare
primarily centered on outpatient care.4,12 In this prospective
study, we evaluate the impact of early dermatology consulta-
tion on the rates of unnecessary antibiotic use and hospital-
ization for patients with presumed cellulitis and model the po-
tential public health implications and cost savings of this
intervention.
Methods
We performed a prospective cohort study evaluating the
impact of dermatology consultation on patients presenting to
the ED, to the ED observation unit, or within 24 hours of ad-
missiontoaninpatientunitwithpresumedcellulitisatBrigham
and Women’
s Hospital, a tertiary care center in Boston,
Massachusetts,betweenFebruaryandSeptemberof2017.This
project was granted a quality improvement exemption by the
Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board, waiving the
requirement for patient consent.
Patient Identification
Patientswerescreenedusingtheelectronicmedicalrecordsys-
tem by a trained research fellow from 8 AM to 5 PM on week-
days. Those who were given a primary diagnosis of cellulitis
by the ED team and designated for admission or observation
status were enrolled. For patients who had physician docu-
mentation concerning for cellulitis (eg, using descriptors such
asskinerythema,skinredness,spreadingerythema,rednessand
swelling, and/or painful erythema) but without a coded diag-
nosis of cellulitis at the time of screening, we manually re-
viewed the entire patient record and contacted the respond-
ing clinician to confirm the proposed diagnosis of cellulitis. In
addition, we performed daily searches of all admitted pa-
tients to identify inpatients with a primary or secondary billed
diagnosis of cellulitis who were admitted within the past 24
hours to capture overnight admissions.
We excluded patients who required antibiotics for cuta-
neous, soft-tissue, and deeper-tissue and/or bone infections
irrespective of cellulitis status, such as patients with known
soft-tissue abscess, deep penetrating wound, animal bite,
osteomyelitis, diabetic ulcer infection, or indwelling hard-
ware at the site of infection. We also excluded patients who
were independently scheduled to be discharged by the ED
(Figure). All enrolled patients were evaluated in person by a
clinical research fellow (D.G.L., F.D.X., H.K.) and a board-
certified dermatologist (A.M., A.K.D.), who provided the pri-
mary treatment team with recommendations on diagnosis,
management, and disposition.
For cases in which a dermatologist diagnosed the patient
with pseudocellulitis, the dermatologist relayed recommen-
dations regarding antibiotic discontinuation, further evalua-
tion,anddispositiontotheprimaryteam.Inaddition,adisease-
specific clinic visit or phone follow-up was scheduled for all
patients shortly after discharge.

Key Points
Question What are the clinical and economic implications of early
dermatology consultation for patients with presumed cellulitis?
Findings This cohort study found that early dermatology
consultation for presumed cellulitis decreased rates of
unnecessary antibiotic use by 74.4% and unnecessary
hospitalizations by 85.0% in patients with pseudocellulitis.
Nationally, dermatology-led screening could eliminate 97 000 to
256 000 unnecessary hospitalization days, protect between
34 000 and 91 000 patients from unnecessary antibiotic
exposure, and save $80 million to $210 million annually.
Meaning Early dermatology consultation for presumed cellulitis
represents an economical intervention that reduces
hospitalization length and antibiotic use for patients with
pseudocellulitis.

The postdischarge course over 30 days was evaluated. Pa-
tients with a scheduled cellulitis- or pseudocellulitis-related
clinic visit were seen in person by the study staff. Clinical notes
for patients seen by nondermatologists were manually re-
viewed. For patients without scheduled visits, a clinical re-
search fellow contacted patients via phone at 2, 7, and 30 days
postdischarge. In both follow-up methods, we collected infor-
mation regarding clinical improvement, medication adher-
ence, and complications stemming from relevant treatment
(eg, rash, anaphylaxis, gastrointestinal distress, diarrhea,
C difficile infection).

Results
Patient Characteristics
One hundred sixty-five patients with presumed cellulitis were
identified, of whom 116 (70.3%) were ultimately enrolled
(Figure). Of these 116 patients, 39 (33.6%) were diagnosed with
pseudocellulitis by dermatology consultation during the hos-
pitalencounter.Theremaining77patients(66.4%)weretreated
per usual care.
Amongthepatients,themean(SD)agewas58.4(19.1)years,
63 (54.3%) were women, and 91 (78.4%) were non-Hispanic
white; patient demographics did not differ significantly by di-
agnosis (P > .05 for all comparisons) (Table 1). The most com-
monly affected location in both cohorts was the lower extrem-
ity,whichwasaffectedin24of39patientswithpseudocellulitis
(61.5%) and 54 of 77 with cellulitis (70.1%). Of 39 patients diag-
nosed with pseudocellulitis, the most common alternative di-
agnoses were stasis dermatitis (23.1%), contact dermatitis
(15.4%), and other variants of dermatitis (10.3%) (Figure).
Change in Management and Disposition
of Patients With Pseudocellulitis
Among 39 patients with pseudocellulitis, 34 (87.2%) had be-
gun receiving oral or intravenous antibiotics at the time of en-
rollment. Discontinuation of oral and intravenous antibiotics
was recommended in 28 of 34 cases (82.4%), and the primary
treatment team acted on these recommendations in 26 of 28
cases (92.9%) (Table 2). The 6 remaining cases had secondary
indications for antibiotic use. Additionally, dermatologists rec-
ommended initiation of topical or systemic steroids and con-
servative management (eg, application of compression stock-
ings, elastic bandages, and hydration) for 26 of 39 (66.7%) and
8of39(20.5%)patientswithpseudocellulitis,respectively.The
primary team acted on this recommendation in 24 of 26 cases
(92.3%) and 7 of 8 cases (87.5%), respectively.
Discharge from planned in-hospital observation or inpa-
tient admission was recommended in 20 of 39 patients with
pseudocellulitis (51.3%), and the primary team acted on this
recommendation in 17 of 20 cases (85.0%) (Table 2). The re-
maining 19 (48.7%) had another medical condition requiring
inpatient observation or admission.

 All enrolled patients received in-clinic or telephone fol-
low-up during the 30 days following discharge, with an over-
all response rate of 75.0% (87 of 116). Thirty of 39 patients with
pseudocellulitis (76.9%) and 57 of 77 with cellulitis (74.0%)
were reached through a clinic or telephone encounter during
the first month after discharge. Among patients with pseudo-
cellulitis, all patients with follow-up stated that the condition
of the affected region had resolved, improved, or stayed the
same. Findings were similar for the cellulitis cohort, apart from
1 patient who indicated worsening pain at the site, despite the
physician note documenting resolution of cellulitis.
Health Care Utilization
Among 39 patients with pseudocellulitis, 10 (25.6%) received
antibiotics after early dermatology consultation. Addition-
ally, 8 of 39 patients with pseudocellulitis (20.5%) were dis-
charged with oral antibiotics. The mean (SD) length of hospi-
tal stay for patients with pseudocellulitis was 2.7 (4.8) days,
with 9 patients (23.1%) discharged on the same day (Table 3).
During the 30 days following discharge, 2 patients with pseu-
docellulitis (5.1%) experienced a drug rash and 1 (2.6%) had di-
arrhea, with none requiring readmission related to cellulitis.
We compared health care utilization rates of patients with
lower-extremity pseudocellulitis in our study with previously
published historical data from usual care at our institution
(Table3).10Patientswithlower-extremitypseudocellulitisinthis
study were more likely to have a same-day discharge, had a de-
crease in length of hospital stay of 2.0 days, were 75.0% less
likely to receive unnecessary antibiotics, were 71.1% less likely
to be discharged on antibiotics, and were 86.9% less likely to
have complications than historical controls during the 30 days
afterdischarge.Thesecharacteristicfindingsweresimilarwhen
comparing historical controls with all patients with pseudocel-
lulitis in this study (2.1-day reduction in length of stay).
Estimated Cost Savings, Avoided Antibiotics,
and Lower Complication Rates
Reductions in length of stay and antibiotic use from broad
evaluation of patients with suspected cellulitis in the United
States may result in 97 000 to 256 000 avoided inpatient hos-
pitalization days and in 34 000 to 91 000 patients avoiding un-
necessaryantibioticsannually.Notably,eachdermatologycon-
sultation for presumed cellulitis could, on average, safeguard
a patient from 1.6 to 2.2 antibiotic days (eTable 1 and eTable 2
in the Supplement).
Less antibiotic use leads to fewer antibiotic-associated ad-
verse effects. Every decile of patients with presumed celluli-
tis screened by a dermatologist may prevent 90 to 1135 cases
of C difficile colitis, 0 to 1 cases of antibiotic-induced anaphy-
laxis, and 90 to 238 nosocomial infections annually (Table 4).
BasedontheHouseholdComponentoftheMedicalExpen-
diturePanelSurveyforhospitalinpatientstaysin2010,thecost
savings associated with a 2.1-day reduction in hospitalization
was $2146.68.19 Across the United States, this reduction leads
to an estimated annual cost reduction of $100 million to $260
million stemming from avoidance of unnecessary hospitaliza-
tions for pseudocellulitis. After considering consultation-
related expenditures of between $20 million and $50 million,
we estimate net savings of between $80 million and $210 mil-
lion annually (eTable 1 in the Supplement). These estimates
translate to an average of $582.39 in net cost savings (after ac-
countingforconsultationfee)perdermatologyconsultationfor
presumed cellulitis (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Ourdatademonstratetheclinicalandeconomicimpactofearly
dermatology consultation in patients admitted with pre-
sumed cellulitis. Of 116 patients with presumed cellulitis, der-
matology consultation determined that 39 (33.6%) were in-
correctly diagnosed. Dermatology consultation also resulted
in antibiotic discontinuation and discharge from planned ob-
servation or inpatient admission in 92.9% and 85.0% of rec-
ommended cases, respectively. Compared with historical con-
trols,patientswithpseudocellulitisinourstudyhadareduction
in length of stay by 2.1 days.
Our findings support and expand on prior studies4,5 that
have demonstrated substantial pseudocellulitis misdiagno-
sis rates. When extrapolated across the United States, univer-
sal dermatology consultation for cellulitis may lead to a re-
duction of 97 000 to 256 000 inpatient days. Additionally, this
interventionisestimatedtosave34 000to91 000patientswith
presumedcellulitisfromunnecessaryantibioticexposureeach
year. These results reveal a major opportunity to reduce mor-
tality and morbidity associated with overhospitalization and
unnecessary antibiotic exposure.20-22
Although these results are promising, broad implementa-
tionofdermatologyconsultationforpresumedcellulitiswillbe
challenging. The dermatologic workforce is currently ill-

 equipped to deal with the influx of inpatient consultations that
abroadscreeningprogramwouldentail.Timelyaccessisachal-
lenge nationally for dermatology, and it is unclear whether re-
allocation of dermatologic resources to the inpatient service
en masse would be ideal from a societal perspective.23,24
Additionally, the economic models to support seeing
patients in the ED or inpatient settings are nascent and at
present insufficient to support dermatologists seeking to
change practice patterns.
Preventing unnecessary admission to the hospital and re-
ducing antibiotic use, while beneficial to the patient and cor-
rect from an ethical perspective, leads to lost revenue in the
current fee-for-service environment. To enable dermatology
consultation more broadly, we need to align reimbursement
systems with what is best for patients and create an environ-
mentthatrewardsdermatologists(andotherclinicians)forsav-
ing money by reducing unnecessary use.
While advocating these changes, we must simultane-
ously experiment with alternative delivery models that allow
increased access to timely inpatient dermatologic consulta-
tions while minimizing unintended consequences on clinical
practice schedules. The use of teledermatology for inpatient
triage has been evaluated, but the accuracy and reliability of
teledermatology in patients with presumed cellulitis have not
been determined.25 The number of dermatology consulta-
tions may be reduced by using diagnostic tools such as the
ALT-70 cellulitis score or bedside diagnostics such as thermal
imaging.26,27 Although these efforts may incrementally im-
prove diagnostic accuracy for cellulitis, the ultimate goal for
investigators should be the identification of a sensitive and
specific point-of-care biomarker for cellulitis.
Despite challenges to the implementation of dermatol-
ogy consultation for presumed cellulitis, we believe our find-
ings serve as a call to action for dermatologists nationally to

 become more proactively involved with the treatment and
evaluation of this disease. Although interventions to educate
nondermatological specialties on recognition of pseudocellu-
litis may theoretically decrease misdiagnosis rates, current ef-
forts have been limited in their efficacy.28 While broad-based
change may be difficult, there is a distinct value in incremen-
talism, and optimizing services where possible will play a large
role in improving patient outcomes while reinforcing the role
of dermatology within the house of medicine.
Limitations
Our findings must be interpreted in the context of the study
design. This investigation was carried out at a single institu-
tion, and although patients span a wide range of age and ra-
cial demographics, further evaluation may be needed to as-
sess the generalizability of our findings. We compared the
results of our intervention with recent historical data at our
institution. It is possible that other changes in hospital triage
and flow are affecting patient stay and antibiotic use, al-
though no other major efforts have been undertaken for these
conditions. We estimated complication rates, and additional
large-scale prospective studies may be needed to evaluate the
spectrum of potentially avoidable complications from unnec-
essary antibiotic exposure. In this study, dermatology evalu-
ation was considered the gold standard for evaluation of cel-
lulitis. Among all patients with pseudocellulitis for whom
dermatologists recommended treatment discontinuation and
discharge, none had worsening outcomes during follow-up,
suggesting robust diagnostic accuracy. However, it is pos-
sible that some cases were misclassified as cellulitis and that
pseudocellulitis cases were in fact underdiagnosed.
