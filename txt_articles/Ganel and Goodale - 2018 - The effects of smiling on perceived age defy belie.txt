Abstract It is a common belief that smiling makes people
appear younger. Empirical findings, however, suggest that
smiling faces are actually perceived as older than neutral
faces. Here we show that these two apparently contradictory
phenomena can co-exist in the same person. In the first exper-
iment, participants were first asked to estimate the ages of a
series of smiling or neutral faces. After that, they were asked
to estimate the average age of the set of neutral and smiling
faces they had just evaluated. Finally, they were asked what
effect smiling has on one’s perceived age. In the experimental
session, smiling faces were perceived as older than neutral
faces. Nevertheless, after the experiment, consistent with their
retrospective evaluations, participants recalled smiling faces
as being younger than the neutral faces. Experiment 2 repli-
cated and extended these results to a set of emotional expres-
sions that also included surprised faces. Smiling faces were
again perceived as older than neutral faces, which were in turn
perceived as older than surprised faces. Again, retrospective
evaluations were consistent with the belief that smiling makes
people look younger. The findings show that this belief, well-
rooted in popular media, is a complete misconception.

Smiling is used as a common social token across many every-
day interactions – and photos of smiling faces dominate ad-
vertising and profile pictures on social media. This undoubt-
edly reflects the association of smiling with many positive
characteristics (Jones, Debruine, Little, Conway, & Feinberg,
2006). It is perhaps not surprising therefore that people asso-
ciate smiling with youthfulness (Voelkle, Ebner,
Lindenberger, & Riediger, 2012).
Recent findings from our lab, however, suggest otherwise:
smiling faces were actually perceived as older, not younger,
than the same faces with a neutral expression (Ganel, 2015).
We proposed that the Baging^ effect of smiling originates from
people’s inability to ignore the wrinkles that form around the
eyes during smiling. Still, the scarce literature on the effect of
smiling on perceived age is inconsistent (Hass, Weston, &
Lim, 2016; Voelkle et al., 2012), and this inconsistency may
be due to the clear discrepancy between the actual effect of
smiling on perceived age and the common belief that smiling
makes one look younger. The current study was explicitly
designed to see if this discrepancy between perception and
belief can exist in the same individual.
In Experiment 1, we first asked participants to evaluate the
age of a series of smiling or neutral faces. To avoid effects of
irrelevant differences between smiling and neutral faces,
photos of the same people with either a neutral or a smiling
expression were presented. To minimize the chances that age
evaluations would be biased due to repeated presentations of
the same people expressing different emotions, facial identity
was counterbalanced across participants so that each partici-
pant was presented with a single (smiling or neutral) exemplar
of each face (Ganel, 2015). In a second part of the experiment,
which participants were not expecting, they were asked to rate
the average age of the neutral and the smiling faces they had
just evaluated. They were then asked a more general question
about the effect of smiling on perceived age.

 Experiment 1
Method
Participants
Forty Ben Gurion University of the Negev students (23 fe-
males, mean age: 24.23 years) participated in the experiment.
All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and
received $7.00 or course credit for their participation. The
protocol was approved by the local ethics committee.
Experimental design and procedure
The design and procedure of the first part of the experiment
were similar to those used in a previous study (Ganel, 2015,
Experiment 1a). Photos of 35 women and 35 men (average
age: 25 years), each with neutral and smiling expressions,
were taken from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces
(KDEF) database (Lundqvist, Flykt, & Öhman, 1998). The
photos were cropped to 7 × 9 cm and were presented on a
19-in. monitor using OpenSesame software. The 140 photos
were divided into two equal sets: in Set A, a particular indi-
vidual was smiling, while in Set B, he or she had a neutral
expression (or vice versa). Half the participants were present-
ed with smiling faces from Set A and neutral faces from Set B.
The other participants were presented with the reverse. In each
case, the faces from Sets A and B were presented in a random
intermixed fashion. Participants were asked to evaluate the
age of each face as accurately as possible.
Following the experimental session, participants were pre-
sented with a series of unanticipated questions. They were told
that they had just been presented with a series of smiling and
neutral faces, and were asked to estimate the average age
evaluations they had given. Participants were then asked to
select a general statement about the effect of smiling on per-
ceived age: (1) smiling has no effect on perceived age; (2)
smiling makes people look younger; or (3) smiling makes
people look older.
Results and discussion
Overall, the 70 individuals in the photos were rated as looking
older in the direct evaluation part of the experiment than they
were in retrospective reports, whether or not the individuals in
the photos were smiling. A repeated measures ANOVA design
with task (direct vs. retrospective age evaluations) and expres-
sion (smiling vs. neutral) revealed a main effect of task
[F(1,39) = 23.13, p < .001, ηp
2 = 0.37]. In addition, the main
effect of expression was not significant [F(1,39) = <1]. More
importantly, a significant interaction revealed that smiling had
different effects on the direct and retrospective evaluations of
age [F(1,39) = 40.33, p < .001, ηp
2 = 0.51].
As can be seen in Fig. 1, the results of the direct evalu-
ations of age closely replicate our previous findings
(Ganel, 2015), namely that smiling faces were reliably rat-
ed as older than the same faces with a neutral expression
[F(1,39) = 23.45, p < 0.001, ηp
2 = 0.38]. More importantly,
however, the retrospective reports of how old the people in
the photos looked went in exactly the opposite direction:
participants erroneously reported that they had perceived
the smiling faces as younger than the neutral faces [F(1,39)
= 14.76, p < .001, ηp
2 = 0.27]. This misconception was
also reflected in the fact that 33 of the 40 participants
thought that smiling makes people look younger, and six
thought that smiling has no effect on perceived age. Only
one of the 40 participants managed to capture the actual
relationship between smiling and perceived age and
thought that smiling makes people look older rather than
younger.
The results of Experiment 1 show a clear dissociation be-
tween people’s perception of facial age and between their
beliefs about the effect smiling has on perceived age. In a
recent study, we showed in a series of experiments that smil-
ing faces are perceived as older than neutral faces of the same
people due to the formation of smile-associated wrinkles in
the region of the eye (Ganel, 2015), which is considered as
crucial for face perception (Namdar, Avidan, & Ganel, 2015;
Rossion, 2009). Clearly, the results of Experiment 1 also show
that people believe that smiling makes faces appear younger
rather than older. This effect can probably be accounted for by
the positive value associated with smiling across various so-
cial situations (Ganel, 2015; Jones et al., 2006; Otta, Lira,
Delevati, Cesar, & Pires, 1994).
In Experiment 2 we aimed at replicating and extending the
results of Experiment 1 within the context of a larger set of
facial expressions. More particularly, in addition to neutral

Fig. 1 Effects of smiling on average perceived age and on retrospective
evaluations of age in Experiment 1. Smiling faces were perceived as older
than neutral faces. At the same time, however, participants believed that
they had evaluated the age of the smiling faces as younger than that of
neutral faces. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (Jarmasz &
Hollands, 2009)

 and smiling faces, we now asked participants to evaluate the
perceived age of faces expressing a surprised emotion.
Surprise is unique in that it involves a complete stretching of
different sets of muscles around the region of the eyes
(Ekman, Gowen, & Joseph, 1980). It is not surprising, there-
fore, that surprise leads to a decrease in the number and inten-
sity of wrinkles around the region of the eyes, even compared
to a neutral expression (for an illustration, see Fig. 2a). In
agreement with the idea that age judgments are biased by
the presence of wrinkles in the region of the eyes (Ganel,
2015), we predicted that surprise would therefore have an
opposite effect on perceived age compared to smiling.
Specifically, we predicted that unlike for smiling faces, sur-
prised faces would be perceived as younger compared to neu-
tral faces. In addition, unlike smiling, which is associated with
positive attributes, surprise is not considered as either positive
or negative (Meyer, Reisenzein, & Schützwohl, 1997). Based
on the idea that the belief about the effect of emotion on
perceived age is driven by commonly-held attributes associ-
ated with that particular emotion, we predicted that unlike
smiling, which is associated with positive traits and would
lead to biased retrospective evaluations of faces as being
younger, surprise would not lead to a such a bias in retrospec-
tive age evaluation.
Experiment 2
Method
Participants
Forty-two Ben Gurion University of the Negev students (32
females, mean age: 23.57 years) participated in the experi-
ment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vi-
sion and received $7.00 or course credit for their participation.
One participant did not provide data for the retrospective age
evaluation of neutral faces and her data were excluded from
the associated analyses. The protocol was approved by the
local ethics committee.
Experimental design and procedure
The design and procedure were similar in many aspects to
those used in Experiment 1, with the exception that three
expressions (smiling, neutral, surprise) rather than two ex-
pressions were used. Photos of 30 women and 30 men (av-
erage age: 25 years), with neutral, smiling, and surprised
expressions were taken from the KDEF face database
(Lundqvist, Flykt, & Öhman, 1998). The 180 photos were
divided into three equal sets: in Set A, a particular individ-
ual was smiling, in Set B, he or she had a neutral expres-
sion, and in Set C, he or she had a surprised expression.
Sets A, B, and C were counterbalanced between subjects in
a similar manner to the counterbalancing method used in
Experiment 1 (but now with six different counterbalancing
orders), so that each participant saw the entire set of faces
carrying the three emotions, but was presented with a single
exemplar of each of the faces.
Following the experimental session, participants were
presented with a series of unanticipated questions. They
were told that they had just been presented with a series
of smiling, surprised, and neutral faces, and were asked to
estimate the average age evaluations they had given.
Given the robust results on beliefs about the apparent
age of smiling faces that were found in Experiment 1, a
general statement questionnaire was not included in
Experiment 2.
Results and discussion
A repeated measures ANOVA design with task (direct vs.
retrospective age evaluations) and expression (smiling, neu-
tral, and surprise) was conducted on the direct and on the
retrospective age evaluations data. As can be seen in Fig. 2b,
direct and retrospective age evaluations of smiling and neutral
faces followed the same pattern of results reported in
Experiment 1. Specifically, smiling faces were again per-
ceived as older than neutral faces [F(1,40) = 25.06, p <

smiling, which increases the extent of wrinkles around the region of the

Effects of smiling and surprise on average perceived age and on
retrospective evaluations of age in Experiment 2. Smiling faces were
again perceived as older than neutral faces, but surprised faces were
perceived as younger than neutral faces. As in Experiment 1,
participants believed that they had evaluated the age of the smiling
faces as younger than that of neutral faces. They did not believe that
they had evaluated the surprised faces as appearing younger or older
than the neutral faces. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals

 0.001, ηp
2 = 0.39], but retrospective reports again went in the
opposite direction, with smiling faces erroneously reported as
being younger than neutral faces [F(1,40) = 26.09, p < .001,
ηp
2 = 0.39]. In line with our prediction, direct age evaluations
also showed that surprise, in contrast to smiling, led to facial
age being evaluated as younger, not older, compared to a
neutral expression [F(1,40) = 6.78, p < 0.05, ηp
2 = 0.14].
Moreover, retrospective evaluations of age did not differ be-
tween surprised and between neutral faces [F(1,40) < 1]. A
main effect of task indicated that age was evaluated as overall
older during direct age evaluations [F(1,40) = 29.78, p <
0.001, ηp
2 = 0.43]. A significant interaction between task
and expression indicated that the emotional expression of
the face had different effects on perceived age and on retro-
spective evaluations of age [F(2,80) = 26.67, p < 0.001, ηp
2 =
0.42].
The results of Experiment 2 replicate and extend the find-
ings of Experiment 1 in several ways. First, the results provide
a close replication of the pattern of the opposite effects that
smiling has on direct ratings of age and on people’s common
belief about the effect of smile on perceived age. Furthermore,
the results emphasize the important role that wrinkles around
the region of the eyes have on perceived age. Finally, the
findings of the retrospective age evaluations show that com-
mon beliefs about age are driven by whether or not a particular
emotion is associated with positive values. In the case of smil-
ing, the relationship with positive values leads to the errone-
ous assumption that smiling faces are perceived as younger. In
the case of surprise, which is not associated with positive or
negative values, surprised faces are not considered to be per-
ceived as either older or younger than neutral faces. Note that,
as was the case for smiling, even for surprise there was a
discrepancy between what people actually perceive and their
retrospective assumptions. In other words, participants’ retro-
spective evaluations revealed that they were blind to the fact
that they had rated surprised faces as appearing younger than
neutral faces.
General discussion
The findings show, for the first time, that people can
erroneously believe that smiling makes one appear younger,
while at the same time rating smiling faces as older than neu-
tral faces. Indeed, participants in our experiment were
completely unaware that their perceptual performance defied
their own beliefs.
The erroneous belief that smiling makes one appear
younger could have potentially biased the results of rele-
vant studies that did not consider the effects common be-
liefs have on overt age classifications. For example, Hass
et al. (2016) asked participants to make general age classi-
fications into two broad categories of Bold^ versus Byoung^
for a series of computerized faces that did not include sev-
eral realistic attributes, such as wrinkles. It is possible,
therefore, that decisions in this study were influenced by
semantic knowledge and by commonly-held beliefs about
age, which could have biased the age classifications of
smiling faces as being younger, not older, compared to
neutral faces. In a similar vein, Voelkle and his colleagues
(2012) did not report significant differences between the
perceived age of smiling and neutral faces. In this study,
an extensive set of faces across different ages and expres-
sions was used, and participants were presented with many
different exemplars of the same faces across different emo-
tional expression. Multiple presentations of the same per-
son with different expressions could have biased partici-
pants’ age evaluations by allowing their ratings to be driven
by common beliefs about age rather than by direct ratings
only. The results of the present study, which highlight a
sharp discrepancy between the effect of smiling and sur-
prise on the direct perception of age and common beliefs
about their effect on the perception of age, call for a careful
consideration of the experimental designs used to measure
perceived age in face recognition studies.
The idea that smiling makes one look younger can be found
throughout popular media and is widely promoted by skin and
dental care companies that have a clear financial interest in
emphasizing the positive effect of smiling on how youthful
one appears. Here, we show that this belief, which is well-
rooted in popular culture, is a complete misconception.
Smiling faces are not perceived as younger than neutral faces;
they are perceived as older. Moreover, our results make it clear
that the same person can believe that smiling makes one ap-
pear younger, but at the same time judge smiling faces as older
than neutral faces.
