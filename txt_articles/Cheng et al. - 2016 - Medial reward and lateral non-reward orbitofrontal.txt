The first brain-wide voxel-level resting state functional connectivity neuroimaging analysis of depression is reported, with 421 patients
with major depressive disorder and 488 control subjects. Resting state functional connectivity between different voxels reflects cor-
relations of activity between those voxels and is a fundamental tool in helping to understand the brain regions with altered con-
nectivity and function in depression. One major circuit with altered functional connectivity involved the medial orbitofrontal cortex
Brodmann area 13, which is implicated in reward, and which had reduced functional connectivity in depression with memory systems
in the parahippocampal gyrus and medial temporal lobe, especially involving the perirhinal cortex Brodmann area 36 and entorhinal
cortex Brodmann area 28. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were correlated with weakened functional connectivity of the
medial orbitofrontal cortex Brodmann area 13. Thus in depression there is decreased reward-related and memory system functional
connectivity, and this is related to the depressed symptoms. The lateral orbitofrontal cortex Brodmann area 47/12, involved in non-
reward and punishing events, did not have this reduced functional connectivity with memory systems. Second, the lateral orbitofrontal
cortex Brodmann area 47/12 had increased functional connectivity with the precuneus, the angular gyrus, and the temporal visual
cortex Brodmann area 21. This enhanced functional connectivity of the non-reward/punishment system (Brodmann area 47/12) with
the precuneus (involved in the sense of self and agency), and the angular gyrus (involved in language) is thus related to the explicit
affectively negative sense of the self, and of self-esteem, in depression. A comparison of the functional connectivity in 185 depressed
patients not receiving medication and 182 patients receiving medication showed that the functional connectivity of the lateral
orbitofrontal cortex Brodmann area 47/12 with these three brain areas was lower in the medicated than the unmedicated patients.
This is consistent with the hypothesis that the increased functional connectivity of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex Brodmann area 47/
12 is related to depression. Relating the changes in cortical connectivity to our understanding of the functions of different parts of the
orbitofrontal cortex in emotion helps to provide new insight into the brain changes related to depression.

Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is ranked by the World
Health Organization as the leading cause of years-of-life
lived with disability (Drevets, 2007; Gotlib and Hammen,
2009; Hamilton et al., 2013). Major depressive episodes,
found in both MDD and bipolar disorder are pathological
mood states characterized by persistently sad or depressed
mood. MDDs are generally accompanied by: (i) altered in-
centive and reward processing, evidenced by amotivation,
apathy, and anhedonia; (ii) impaired modulation of anxiety
and worry, manifested by generalized, social and panic
anxiety, and oversensitivity to negative feedback; (iii) in-
flexibility of thought and behaviour in association with
changing reinforcement contingencies, apparent as rumina-
tive thoughts of self-reproach, pessimism, and guilt, and
inertia
toward
initiating
goal-directed
behaviour;
(iv)
altered integration of sensory and social information, as
evidenced by mood-congruent processing biases; (v) im-
paired attention and memory, shown as performance def-
icits on tests of attention set-shifting and maintenance, and
autobiographical and short-term memory; and (vi) visceral
disturbances, including altered weight, appetite, sleep, and
endocrine and autonomic function (Drevets, 2007; Gotlib
and Hammen, 2009).
The ability to measure brain function using non-invasive
neuroimaging techniques has greatly enhanced our under-
standing of this illness (Rigucci et al., 2010). Patients with
depression show impairments in the coordinated activity of
several brain regions considered to be important for several
domains of mental functioning such as emotional process-
ing (amygdala, subgenual anterior cingulate and pallidum)
(Sheline et al., 2010; Disner et al., 2011), self-referential
processes (medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and poster-
ior cingulate cortex) (Price and Drevets, 2010; Sheline
et al., 2010; Kuhn and Gallinat, 2013), cognitive functions
such as memory (hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex)
(Lorenzetti
et
al.,
2009),
visual
processing
(fusiform
gyrus, lingual gyrus and lateral temporal cortex) (Veer
et al., 2010), and attention processing (dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and
insula) (Hamilton et al., 2012).
Research into the pathophysiology of depression has
included the analysis of possible differences in the func-
tional connectivity of different brain areas to elucidate
some of the brain changes that may relate to depression.
Resting-state functional MRI provides a task-free approach
that removes some performance-related confounds, and
provides a reliable measure of ‘baseline’ brain activity
and connectivity (Gusnard et al., 2001). The functional

 connectivity is measured by the correlation between the
functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent signals in
different brain areas when in the resting state, that is
when no task is being performed. The concept is that the
correlations may reveal evidence about which brain systems
may interact differently in neuropsychiatric disorders (Deco
and Kringelbach, 2014). There have been a number of rest-
ing state functional connectivity studies on depression
(Wang et al., 2012; Iwabuchi et al., 2015). Most studies
do not include large numbers of participants, and therefore
there are insufficient data to allow voxel-level analysis,
though this can be very important in helping to reveal
exactly which cortical systems may be connected differently
in mental disorders (Cheng et al., 2015). There is an urgent
need to use methods that will allow large-scale pooling of
data to increase the statistical power to obtain voxel-level
analysis, as well as to reduce the impact of heterogeneity in
the patient population. A meta-analysis of previous inves-
tigations
of
resting
state
functional
connectivity
in
depression was based on seed-based studies each with
tens of participants, and concluded as follows (Kaiser
et al., 2015):
‘Major depressive disorder was characterized by hypoconnectiv-
ity within the frontoparietal network, a set of regions involved
in cognitive control of attention and emotion regulation, and
hypoconnectivity between frontoparietal systems and parietal
regions of the dorsal attention network involved in attending
to the external environment. Major depressive disorder was
also associated with hyperconnectivity within the default net-
work, a network believed to support internally oriented and
self-referential thought, and hyperconnectivity between fronto-
parietal control systems and regions of the default network.
Finally, the MDD groups exhibited hypoconnectivity between
neural systems involved in processing emotion or salience and
midline cortical regions that may mediate top-down regulation
of such functions.’
For comparison, the present study included almost as
many participants as this meta-analysis, was not forced,
because of small numbers of participants, to rely on a
priori,
seed-based
analyses,
and
was
able—given
the
voxel-based approach—to focus on particular brain re-
gions, rather than brain systems identified, for example as
the ‘default mode network’ or ‘fronto-parietal control
systems’.
Given this background, the objective of this investigation
was to perform the first investigation using a voxel-based
unbiased brain-wide association study (BWAS) approach
on resting state functional MRI data in patients with
MDD. The BWAS approach is modelled along the lines
of genome-wide association studies where large genetic
datasets are pooled to identify significant genetic variations
in specific disorders. We aimed to include a large number
of participants in this neuroimaging research to enable
voxel-level
accuracy
and
robustness
of
the
findings
(Button et al., 2013). In this investigation, the voxel-level
resolution of the functional connectivity enabled differ-
ences of functional connectivity to be measured in nearby
but functionally different parts of the orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC), and to reveal with which voxels in other brain
areas
there
was
altered
functional
connectivity.
The
voxel-level analysis enabled this advance to be made.
The value of the unbiased approach was that it enabled
the functional connectivity between every pair of voxels in
the brain to be measured, so that the findings were not
limited by prior hypotheses.

 1960) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck and
Beamesderfer, 1974). One hundred and eighty-five of the pa-
tients were not receiving medication at the time of neuroima-
ging. Table 1 provides a summary of the demographic
information and the psychiatric diagnosis (showing how they
were diagnosed) of the participants. Further details are pro-
vided in the Supplementary material.
Image acquisition and preprocessing
Data for resting state functional connectivity analysis were col-
lected in 3 T MRI scanners in an 8-min period in which the
participants were awake in the scanner not performing a task,
using standard protocols described in the Supplementary
material.
Data preprocessing was performed using DPARSF (Chao-
Gan and Yu-Feng, 2010) (http://restfMRI.net), which is a tool-
box based on the SPM8 software package. The first 10 echo
planar imaging (EPI) scans were discarded to suppress equili-
bration effects. The remaining scans of each subject underwent
slice timing correction by sinc interpolating volume slices,
motion correction for volume to volume displacement, spatial
normalization to standard Montreal Neurological Institute
(MNI) space using affine transformation and non-linear de-
formation with a voxel size of 3 � 3 � 3 mm3 followed by
spatial smoothing (8 mm full-width at half-maximum). To
remove the sources of spurious correlations present in resting
state
blood
oxygen
level-dependent
data,
all
functional
MRI
time
series
underwent
band-pass
temporal
filtering
(0.01–0.1 Hz), nuisance signal removal from the ventricles,
and deep white matter, and regressing out any effects of
head motion using the Friston et al. (1996) 24 head motion
parameters procedure. Finally, we implemented additional
careful volume censoring (‘scrubbing’) movement correction
as reported by Power et al. (2014) to ensure that head-
motion artefacts are not driving observed effects. The mean
framewise displacement was computed with framewise dis-
placement threshold for displacement being 0.5 mm. In add-
ition to the frame corresponding to the displaced time point,
one preceding and two succeeding time points were also
deleted to reduce the ‘spill-over’ effect of head movements.
Subjects with 410% displaced frames flagged were completely
excluded from the analysis as it is likely that such high-level of
movement would have had an influence on several volumes.
Global signals were not regressed out (see Supplementary ma-
terial, where the results with global signal removal are referred
to for completeness).
Any effects of gender ratio, years of education, and age be-
tween the patient and control groups were regressed out in the
analysis. In fact, there were no differences in the gender ratios,
though the number of years of education was lower in the
patients than controls. Additional analyses showed for males
versus females that the overall pattern of functional connect-
ivity differences for patients versus controls were similar, and
that the correlation of the functional connectivity changes be-
tween males and females was high (0.89, P 5 0.0001). Further,
none of the functional connectivity link differences found be-
tween patients and controls was correlated significantly [false
discovery rate (FDR) P 5 0.05] with the number of years of
education. We also note that the Taiwanese sample included
patients
with
depression
in
remission
while
under
antidepressant
treatment,
and
thus
their
scores
on
the
HAMD assessment were in the low range.
Voxel-wise brain-wide association
studies
Step 1: Analysis within each imaging centre
In the present study, each resting state functional MRI image
included 47 619 voxels, which is based on the automated
anatomical labelling (AAL2) atlas (Rolls et al., 2015). For
each pair of voxels, the time series were extracted and their
correlation was calculated for each subject followed by z-
transformation. Two-tailed, two-sample t-tests were performed
on
the

(47 619 � 47 618/2)
Fisher’s
z-
transformed correlation coefficients to identify significantly
altered
functional
links
in
patients
with
depression
compared to controls within each imaging centre. The effect
of age, gender ratios, education and head motion (mean fra-
mewise displacement) were regressed within each dataset in
this step.
Step 2: Combination of results from all imaging
centres
The Liptak-Stouffer z-score method (Liptak, 1958), which is a
well-validated method for multi-site datasets and has previ-
ously been used widely in multi-site MRI data analysis
(Glahn et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2011) was then used to combine
the results from the individual datasets. Specifically, the
P-value of each functional connectivity result from the two-
sample t-test in Step 1 was converted to its corresponding
z-score. This was calculated firstly as in equation:
zi ¼ ��1ð1 � piÞ
ð1Þ
where � is the standard normal cumulative distribution func-
tion and i represents the i site. Next, a combined z-score for a
functional
connectivity
was
calculated
using
the
Liptak-
Stouffer formula:
Z ¼

ð2Þ
which follows a standard normal distribution under the null
hypothesis; where wi ¼
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
samplesize
p
is the weight of the i
dataset. Finally, The Z is transformed into its corresponding
P-value and a FDR procedure was used to correct for multiple
comparisons.
Step 3: Calculating a measure for the association of
voxels
A measure for the association (MA) between a voxel i and the
brain disorder was then defined as: MA ¼ Na, where Na is the
number of links between voxel i and every other voxel in the
brain that have a P-value of less than a (which in the pre-
sent study with FDR correction was P 5 0.01, corresponding
to a P threshold of 2.52 � 10�7 in t-tests). A larger value of
MA
implies
a
more
significant
difference
in
functional
connectivity.
For the functional connectivity of a voxel to be treated as
significantly different (P 5 0.01) after FDR correction from an-
other voxel, the significance level uncorrected had to be

 P 5 2.52 � 10�7. The smallest P-value found was �10�13.
Clusters with less than 10 voxels were not included to
reduce the possibility of false positive results and to ensure
that only consistent differences in functional connectivity
were considered, following earlier practice (Wittmann et al.,
2005; Konrad et al., 2006; Hart et al., 2012).
Although the voxel-level BWAS identifies all altered voxel-
wise different functional connectivities in patients with de-
pression, it is difficult to describe and show all of these chan-
ged links. Accordingly, to facilitate the description of the
voxel-wise results, we conducted post hoc clusterwise ana-
lyses from each cluster of voxels returned by BWAS. It

 should be noted that all cluster-wise analyses are based on
the findings of BWAS, and that it is the BWAS statistics only
on which we rely. The cluster analyses just simplify the de-
scription
of
the
different
functional
connectivities
in
depression.
Clinical correlates
We also investigated whether the differences in functional con-
nectivity between patients and controls were correlated with
clinical variables HAMD (Hamilton, 1960), BDI (Beck and
Beamesderfer,
1974),
and
illness
duration
(Bell-McGinty
et al., 2002; de Diego-Adelino et al., 2014). We used the
Liptak-Stouffer z-score method (Liptak, 1958) to combine
the data from the different neuroimaging sites for this analysis,
for this provides a principled way to take into consideration
possible
differences
in
these
measures
between
sites.
Specifically, we calculated the partial correlation between the
strength of each altered functional connection with HAMD,
BDI score, and with illness duration after removing the effect
of sex and age, in each individual centre, then we used the
Liptak-Stouffer z-score method to combine the results from the
individual datasets.
Results
The functional MRI resting state functional connectivity
analyses were performed with 421 patients with a diagnosis
of major depression, and 488 control subjects, and this
large population was sufficient to allow voxel-level analysis
with fully corrected statistics.
A brain-wide association study of
voxels with different functional con-
nectivity in depressed patients
As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2, there were a number of
voxel clusters with different functional connectivity in pa-
tients with depression compared to controls.
A large cluster of voxels (n = 274) was in the left medial
temporal lobe with peak at (x y z �27 �9 �36). This
cluster was in the parahippocampal gyrus, extending into
the fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal and temporal pole
areas, and indeed these voxels were classified as in areas in
the AAL2 atlas (Rolls et al., 2015) that included left
hippocampus,
parahippocampal
gyrus,
fusiform
gyrus,
middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole (middle temporal
gyrus), and inferior temporal gyrus (Table 2). The voxel
with the highest measure of association [MA, the number
of voxels with which a voxel has a functional connectivity
difference significant at P 5 0.01 (FDR correction)] was
284 (Table 2). It is clear from Fig. 1 that the majority of
these voxels were in the perirhinal cortex Brodmann area
(BA) 36, and the entorhinal cortex BA 28. There was a
corresponding cluster on the right [with peak at (24 12
�39)] (Table 2).
A second large cluster of voxels was in the medial
OFC BA 13 with peak at (�15 12 �15) (Table 2 and
Fig. 1). In the AAL2 atlas this included left olfactory,
rectus, medial OFC, anterior OFC, posterior OFC, insula,
but the locations of these voxels as shown in Fig. 1 was
in BA 13 just extending anteriorly in area 11, according
to the cytoarchitectonic designation (O

13 extends quite far posterior towards what topologically is
close to the anterior ventral insula]. There was a corres-
ponding cluster on the right [with peak at (15 24 �18)].
A third cluster, with a high peak MA value of 136,
was in lateral OFC area 47/12 (O
¨ ngu

peak at (36 36 �12). In Fig. 1 it can be seen in slices at

It
was
in

Frontal_Inf_Orb_2_R.
A fourth cluster was in the anterior cingulate cortex in
the just supracallosal part with peak at (�6 36 21) (Fig. 1
and Table 2).
A fifth cluster was in the precuneus and adjoining pos-
terior cingulate cortex with peak at (�6 �54 30) (Fig. 1
and Table 2).
A sixth cluster was in the left angular gyrus, with peaks
at (�48 �60 21) and (�48 �69 42).
A seventh cluster was in the middle temporal gyrus, in a
part that is BA 21 and is a high order temporal cortical
visual area involved in processing objects and faces.
Other minor clusters in the thalamus and postcentral
cortex are indicated in Table 2.
Analysis of the functional connectivity
links that were different in patients
with depression
To investigate the brain areas between which there was
different functional connectivity in depression, and whether
it was increased or decreased, the functional connectivity of
the voxels with significant differences of functional connect-
ivity (after FDR correction at P 5 0.05, and within the
voxel clusters shown in Table 2) were measured for each
of the AAL2 regions within which the voxels were located.
In this way, 23 regions of interest were identified, and the
functional connectivity differences between the significantly
different voxels in these regions are shown in Fig. 2 as a
connectivity matrix.
First the altered functional connectivity of the medial
OFC, area 13, brain region is considered. The relevant
voxels
are
in
regions
such as
medial
OFC,
anterior
OFC, posterior OFC, olfactory, rectus, and insula in the
AAL2 atlas on the left and the right (Table 2). The
voxels within this area 13 cluster have high positive
Figure 2 Functional connectivity differences between the voxels that are significantly different in the depressed and the
control group, separated by the AAL2 region in which the significant voxels were located. (A) Links with increased functional
connectivities in patients are shown in yellow-red, and decreased connectivities are in blue. The colour bar shows the –log10 of the P-value
for the difference of the functional connectivity. Entries in the matrix are provided where P 5 0.05 (FDR correction). The matrix itself
contains rows and columns for all cases in which there were 10 or more significant voxels within an AAL2 region. (B) The links are shown
in red if they are significantly stronger in the patient group, and in blue if they are significantly weaker in the patient group. The thickness of
the lines indicates the degree of alteration of the functional connectivity. The anatomical abbreviations are for the areas in the automated
anatomical atlas, with abbreviations shown in Supplementary Table 1. The brain regions in the left hemisphere are in the left semicircle of
the diagram.

 correlations between them, and have generally the same
pattern of altered functional connectivity in depression,
and so is described in the remainder of this paper as
OFC13. As shown in Fig. 2, OFC13 has very significantly
reduced functional connectivity with the parahippocampal,
fusiform, temporal pole and temporal_Inf areas (and many
of the voxels in these areas are in the perirhinal cortex area
36 and the entorhinal cortex area 28, as shown in Fig. 1),
which again act similarly in this investigation, so are
referred to as the medial temporal lobe (MedTL) cluster
in the remainder of this paper. OFC13 also has reduced
functional connectivity between the voxels in its different
AAL2 regions (Fig. 2). Some parts of OFC13, in particular
posterior OFC, has increased functional connectivity with
the precuneus.
Second, OFC47/12 on the right (Frontal_Inf_Orb_2_R in
the AAL2 atlas) has increased functional connectivity with
the left angular gyrus, left precuneus, and left and right
Temporal_Mid [e.g. (66 �15 �18) which is BA 21, tem-
poral visual cortex]. OFC47/12 does not have reduced
functional connectivity with the parahippocampal areas
(Fig. 2). This lateral OFC network is therefore very differ-
ent in its change in functional connectivity in depression
from the OFC13 network in the medial OFC.
Third, the anterior cingulate cortex (in which the voxels
are just supracallosal) has reduced functional connectivity
in depressed patients with some temporal cortex areas
including the fusiform gyrus, with the angular cortex, and
no difference in functional connectivity with most medial
orbitofrontal areas (OFC13) (apart from a small increase
with OFC_Med_R).
Other functional connectivity changes include increased
thalamic connectivity with some medial orbitofrontal, and
parahippocampal/temporal cortex regions, and the postcen-
tral gyrus (Fig. 2).
Clinical symptom correlates of the
altered circuits
As can be seen from Table 3, there were significant correl-
ations (P 5 0.05 uncorrected) between some of the region
of interest-wise functional links and the symptom severity
scores
and
illness
duration.
Specifically,
the
HAMD
(Hamilton, 1960) score was correlated with weakened
functional connectivity between some of the areas within
the medial OFC (OFC13). Analysis of the subscores of the
HAMD showed that links involving OFC13 were corre-
lated with most of the 17 subscores apart from 10 and
15. Interestingly, links involving OFC47/12 were negatively
correlated with H6 Insomnia (waking up early), and with
H17 Insight.
The BDI score (available only for the Xinan dataset of
183 patients) was also correlated with decreased func-
tional connectivity between several of the medial OFC13
subregions and several of the parahippocampal/temporal
subregions; and also with decreased functional connectiv-
ity
of
the
temporal
areas
(Temporal_Inf_L
and
Temporal_Pole_L), and of Temporal_Mid-R with the
postcentral
gyrus
(Table

 interest-wise functional connectivity and either the HAMD
or the BDI reached 0.41 (P = 1.6 � 10�11).
The illness duration (Table 3) was negatively correlated
with functional connectivity between the lateral OFC47/12
voxels and the left angular gyrus and Temporal-Mid_L clus-
ter of Table 3. The illness duration was also correlated with
weaker functional connectivity between the posterior part of
the medial OFC13 cluster (specifically the part within
Insula_L in the AAL2 atlas) and some parahippocampal/
temporal areas (Table 3). Illness duration was also correlated
with weaker functional connectivity between the left angular
gyrus and the (supracallosal) anterior cingulate cortex. These
correlations strengthen the interpretation of the changes in
functional connectivity in these regions found in patients
with depression, in that these functional connectivities were
related to the depression that was measured in these patients.
Comparison of functional connectiv-
ity in medicated and unmedicated
patients with depression
Within the depressed group, 185 were not receiving medi-
cation,
and
236
patients
were
receiving
medication.
Although it was not a primary aim of this investigation,
and following a suggestion, the effects of medication were
assessed by comparing the functional connectivity in 185
patients
not
receiving
medication,
and
182
patients
receiving medication, from the Dongbei and Xinan datasets
(see Supplementary material for details including demo-
graphic and clinical details, and limitations). The medica-
tion consisted in most cases of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) including fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertra-
line, citalopram and escitalopram; or serotonin-norepineph-
rine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venflaxine, or a
tetracyclic antidepressant such as mirtazepine. The overall
pattern of functional connectivity differences between pa-
tients
and
controls
is
similar
for
the
unmedicated
(Supplementary
Fig.
1A)
and
the
medicated
(Supplementary Fig. 1B) subgroups of patients, providing
evidence that the main differences between patients and
controls shown in Figs 1–3 were found in depressed pa-
tients whether or not they were receiving medication.
Although the overall pattern of functional connectivity is
similar in the subgroup without medication (Supplementary
Fig. 1A) and with medication (Supplementary Fig. 1B), to
test for significant differences, a t-test was performed be-
tween these two functional connectivity matrices, with the
results shown in Supplementary Fig. 1C. As one of the
main findings for differences of functional connectivity be-
tween patients and controls was increased functional con-
nectivity of the lateral OFC BA 47/12 with the precuneus,
angular gyrus and mid-temporal gyrus (Figs 2 and 3), and
to relieve the burden of multiple comparisons, we tested in
a pre-planned comparison whether these three functional

 connectivity links were weaker in medicated than in unme-
dicated patients. For the Frontal_Inf_Orb_2R with precu-
neus
link
there
is
a
significantly
smaller
functional
connectivity in the medicated than the unmedicated group
(t = 2.17, P = 0.015, one-tailed test of the specific prediction
in all three cases). For the Frontal_Inf_Orb_2R with angu-
lar gyrus link there is a significantly smaller functional con-
nectivity in the medicated than the unmedicated group
(t = 2.55, P = 0.005). For the Frontal_Inf_Orb_2R with
temporal_Mid_L link there is a significantly smaller func-
tional connectivity in the medicated than the unmedicated
group (t = 1.76, P = 0.039). The results overall are thus
consistent with the hypothesis that the increased functional
connectivity of the lateral OFC BA 47/12 with the precu-
neus, angular gyrus, and mid-temporal gyrus is related to
depression, and that treatment with medication reduces the
functional connectivity of these three links.
Discussion
The main findings are first that one major circuit with
altered functional connectivity in depression involves the
medial OFC BA 13, which is implicated in reward, and
which had reduced functional connectivity in depression
with memory systems in the parahippocampal gyrus and
medial temporal lobe, involving especially the perirhinal
cortex BA 36 and entorhinal cortex BA 28. The lateral
OFC BA 47/12, involved in non-reward and punishing
events, did not have this reduced functional connectivity
with memory systems, so that there is an imbalance in de-
pression towards decreased reward-related memory system
functionality. Second, BA 47/12 had increased functional
connectivity with the precuneus, the angular gyrus, and
the temporal visual cortex BA 21. This enhanced functional
connectivity of the non-reward/punishment system (BA 47/
12) with the precuneus (involved in the sense of self and
agency), and the angular gyrus (involved in language) is
thus related to the explicit affectively negative sense of
the self, and of self-esteem, in depression.
In a further analysis, it was shown that the overall pat-
tern of functional connectivity differences between patients
and controls is similar for the unmedicated (Supplementary
Fig. 1A) and the medicated (Supplementary Fig. 1B) sub-
groups of patients, providing evidence that the main differ-
ences between patients and controls shown in Figs 1–3
were found in depressed patients whether or not they
were receiving medication. In preplanned comparisons, it
was further shown that the functional connectivities of
the right lateral OFC BA 47/12 (Frontal_Inf_Orb_2R)
with the precuneus, angular gyrus, and mid-temporal
gyrus, the links highlighted in Fig. 3B, were reduced in
the medicated patients compared to the unmedicated pa-
tients (Supplementary Fig. 1C, with the statistics in the
Supplementary material). The results overall are thus con-
sistent with the hypothesis that the increased functional
connectivity of the lateral OFC BA 47/12 with the precu-
neus, angular gyrus, and mid-temporal gyrus is related to
depression, and that treatment with medication reduces the
functional connectivity of these three links. In addition to
these preplanned tests, it is notable that the medicated pa-
tients had a lower functional connectivity between the lat-
eral OFC and the medial OFC (Supplementary material).
These parts of the OFC have a reciprocal relation with
respect to their activations by rewards (medially) and by
non-reward or loss laterally, and the smaller functional
connectivity in medicated patients than unmedicated pa-
tients may be related to a change in this reciprocal relation.
It is noted that limitations of this analysis of the effects of
medication are that this was not a main aim of this inves-
tigation, that this is a cross-sectional not longitudinal com-
parison, and that the mean illness duration was 28.5
months in the unmedicated group and 58.6 months in the
medicated group.
We now place these findings on functional connectivity
differences in depression in the context of the known func-
tions of the brain regions implicated in this investigation,
which include emotion-related, non-reward and punish-
ment-related regions of the OFC (Rolls, 2014, 2016b),
and of previous investigations into depression. The theory
that depression is associated with the maladaptive re-
sponses to non-reward and punishment and hyposensitivity
to reward has been extensively investigated (Eshel and
Roiser, 2010; Russo and Nestler, 2013; Whitton et al.,
2015; Rolls, 2016b). At the psychological level, Beck’s psy-
chological
theory
of
depression
(Beck,
1979)
and
Seligman’s learned helplessness model (Seligman, 1972),
both focused around punishment and reward, and brain
areas related to punishment and reward have become pri-
mary targets in psychotherapy (Beck, 2008). At the neural
level, networks related to punishment and reward have
been related to depression, and in some cases to mono-
amines (McCabe et al., 2012; Harmer and Cowen, 2013;
Felger et al., 2015; Huys et al., 2015).
Given this background, we first consider voxels in the
medial parts of the OFC shown in Fig. 1 that are within
the OFC13 cluster. Figure 2 shows that in depression the
voxels with altered functional connectivity in these areas
have reduced functional connectivity with the parahippo-
campal/temporal lobe/fusiform cortical left and right clus-
ters, especially involving the perirhinal cortex BA 36 and
entorhinal cortex BA 28 as shown in Fig. 1. These para-
hippocampal areas are involved in memory, and inter alia
provide a gateway to and from the hippocampal memory
system (Kesner and Rolls, 2015). Indeed, the medial and
mid OFC BA13 has direct reciprocal connections with the
perirhinal cortex BA 36 (Kondo et al., 2005), which in turn
connects via the entorhinal cortex BA 28 to the hippocam-
pus (Kesner and Rolls, 2015). There is extensive evidence
that the human medial OFC areas, including OFC13, is
activated by rewarding stimuli that are subjectively pleasant
(including pleasant odours, pleasant touch, pleasant fla-
vour, and monetary reward) (O’Doherty et al., 2001;

 Grabenhorst and Rolls, 2011; Rolls, 2014). The connec-
tions between the medial and mid OFC BA 13 and the
perirhinal cortex BA 36 (which in turn connects to the
entorhinal cortex and thus to the hippocampus) provides
a route for reward/emotion-related information to reach the
hippocampus to become part of an episodic memory; and
during later recall for the reward/emotion-related part of an
episodic memory to be recalled to the OFC (Rolls, 2014,
2016a; Kesner and Rolls, 2015). It has therefore been sug-
gested that there are weaker functional connectivity links in
depression between brain areas involved in pleasant feelings
and rewards with memory systems, and that this may be
part of the mechanism of depression (Rolls, 2016b). This
hypothesis is strengthened by the correlation between the
symptoms of depression and the weakening of links be-
tween the medial OFC13 system and the parahippocam-
pal/medial temporal lobe memory system areas as shown
in Table 3. Consistent with the hypothesis, the anhedonia
of depression can be related to decreased effects of pleasant
rewarding stimuli in the medial OFC during depression,
effects
that
can
be
restored
by
antidepressants
(Ma,
2015). Consistent with the importance of the OFC in de-
pression, grey matter volume reductions are found in this
area in patients with depression (Ballmaier et al., 2004).
Second, the lateral OFC cluster OFC47/12 is in a region
that is activated by many types of non-reward and unpleas-
ant stimuli (Grabenhorst and Rolls, 2011; Rolls, 2014),
including losing money (O’Doherty et al., 2001), not
receiving an expected social reward (Kringelbach and
Rolls, 2003), and unpleasant odours. This region has very
different changed functional connectivity in depression,
with increased functional connectivity with the precuneus,
angular gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus BA 21. The pre-
cuneus is a parietal region implicated in the sense of self
and agency (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006), and the left (not
right) angular gyrus/middle temporal gyrus is implicated in
language processing (Cabeza and Nyberg, 2000). This has
led to the hypothesis that this lateral non-reward/punish-
ment system in OFC47/12 with its increased functional
connectivity with self- and language-related systems relates
to some of the symptoms of depression (Rolls, 2016b). The
BA 21 region is high order visual cortex corresponding to
the macaque inferior temporal visual cortex where faces
and objects are represented (Rolls, 2012), and the increased
functional connectivity of OFC47/12 with BA 21 may
result in more affectively negative processing of visual
inputs (Rolls, 2016b). Indeed, this increased functional con-
nectivity between the inferior temporal visual cortex area
21 and the lateral OFC OFC47/12 non-reward/punishment
system may lead to depressed patients having difficulty in
categorizing happy face stimuli as happy (Harmer and
Cowen, 2013).
Consistent with the hypothesis of disturbed function of
the OFC in depression, there is increased regional cerebral
blood flow in the ventrolateral OFC area 47/12 in depres-
sion (Drevets et al., 1992, 2004; Price and Drevets, 2010).
In
addition,
over-general
autobiographical
memory
manifests in individuals with MDD tested during depressed
(dMDD) or remitted phases (rMDD), and healthy individ-
uals at high risk for developing MDD. During specific auto-
biographical memory recall, high risk individuals have
increased activity relative to rMDDs and healthy controls
in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and lateral
OFC (Young et al., 2015). The increased functional con-
nectivity of the lateral OFC (involved in non-reward and
aversive processing), the precuneus (involved in the sense of
self), and the angular gyrus (involved in language) in de-
pression is of interest, for a sign of the start of a depressive
episode may be negative thoughts about the self and low
self-esteem, all expressed explicitly in language (Wegener
et al., 2015). It is notable that OFC47/12, the non-
reward punishment area, has increased functional connect-
ivity with each of these areas, but that they do not have
increased connectivity with each other. The common hub
to this system is the lateral OFC47/12.
In comparing the medial OFC13 (reward) and lateral
OFC47/12 (non-reward) systems, there is evidence that
they are very different systems, for the correlation between
the functional connectivities within the different AAL2 re-
gions of OFC13 was typically high (r = 0.6–0.9), and the
functional
connectivities
of
each
of
these
areas
with
OFC47/12 were typically low (r = 0.23–0.37) (P 5 10�14).
Both systems though may contribute to the lack of motiv-
ation that is frequent in depression. The medial OFC/
medial temporal lobe memory system reduced functional
connectivity may contribute by making remembered re-
wards, the goals for action, less rewarding, and therefore
less motivating (Rolls, 2014, 2016b). The lateral orbito-
frontal non-reward system with its increased functional
connectivity may make non-reward more potent, and this
facilitation would also be expected to check motivation by
enhancing the inhibiting effects on behaviour of non-
reward and expected non-reward (Rolls, 2014, 2016b).
The anterior cingulate cortex (in which the voxel clusters
are just supracallosal) had reduced functional connectivity
in depressed patients with some temporal cortex areas
including the fusiform gyrus, and with the angular cortex
(Figs 2A and 3A), and no difference in functional connect-
ivity with most medial orbitofrontal areas (OFC13) (apart
from a small increase with OFC_Med_R). This supracallo-
sal part of the far anterior cingulate cortex is at the anterior
end of a supracallosal cingulate region in which many un-
pleasant stimuli are represented (Grabenhorst and Rolls,
2011; Rolls, 2014), and is therefore implicated in mood
(Rolls, 2014). This region is just above and behind the
pregenual cingulate cortex area in which a few additional
voxels with significantly different functional connectivity
were found in the depressed group, and this pregenual cin-
gulate region has representations of pleasant and rewarding
stimuli (Grabenhorst and Rolls, 2011; Rolls, 2014), and is
thereby
also
implicated
in
mood
(Rolls,
2014).
Interestingly, functional connectivity changes were not
found in the subcallosal cingulate cortex including the sub-
genual cingulate cortex (with the area found here more

 ventral, in OFC13), though a few voxels with altered func-
tional connectivity were found in the amygdala, with both
these regions showing increased cerebral blood flow in de-
pression (Drevets et al., 1997; Price and Drevets, 2010).
We now consider the changes in functional connectivity
in depression in other brain areas not typically associated
with mood and emotion. The thalamus had increased func-
tional connectivity with a number of cortical areas, as
shown in Fig. 2, with the coordinate (9 �27 9) indicating
that this is part of the medial pulvinar, which has temporal
lobe connections including visual temporal cortex areas
(Johansen-Berg et al., 2005). The medial thalamus has
increased cerebral blood flow in depression (Price and
Drevets, 2010).
It is interesting to relate these changes in functional con-
nectivity to the level of activity in these different brain areas
in patients with depression. Hyperactivation during affect-
ive processing tasks has been described in the thalamus and
parahippocampal gyrus (Miller et al., 2015), and increased
cerebral blood flow in patients with MDD has been found
in the medial as well as the lateral OFC (Drevets et al.,
1992; Price and Drevets, 2010).
Although changes have been found in some of these re-
gions in previous studies in depression including the precu-
neus, angular gyrus, and hippocampal system (Sundermann
et al., 2014), the present study is statistically more powerful
because of the large number of participants involved (421
patients with a diagnosis of major depression, and 488
controls), and therefore allows analysis at the voxel level,
which as we have seen greatly facilitates the interpretation
of the findings by enabling the functional connectivity to be
related to the different functions of even nearby brain re-
gions such as the medial and lateral OFC.
