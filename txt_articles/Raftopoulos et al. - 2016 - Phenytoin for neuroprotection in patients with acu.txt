Summary 
 
Background: Acute optic neuritis (AON), a common feature of multiple sclerosis, can 
damage vision through neurodegeneration in the retina and optic nerve. Inhibition 
of voltage-gated sodium channels is neuroprotective in preclinical models. In this 
phase 2 trial we assessed whether sodium channel inhibition with phenytoin is also 
neuroprotective in AON. 
Methods: We undertook a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial at two 
UK neuroscience centres. Patients with AON aged 18-60 years and presenting within 
two weeks of onset were randomly assigned 1:1 via a web-based service by 
minimisation to phenytoin (6mg/kg) or placebo for three months.  Participants, 
treating and assessing physicians were all masked to group assignment. The primary 
outcome was affected eye retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness at six months, 
adjusted for fellow eye RNFL thickness at baseline. The primary intention-to-treat 
analysis included all randomised participants assessed at six months. The trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov  (NCT 01451593). 
Findings: We recruited 86 participants between February 2012 and May 2014 (42 
phenytoin, 44 placebo). Primary analysis included 81 participants (39 phenytoin, 42 
placebo). Mean affected eye RNFL thickness at six months was significantly greater 
in the phenytoin group (81·46μm [SD 16·27] vs 74·29μm [SD 15·14] placebo; 
adjusted active-placebo difference 7·15μm [95% CI 1·08-13·22; p=0·021]), a 30% 
beneficial treatment effect when comparing the extent to which the RNFL thickness 
was lost in the two groups. Treatment was well tolerated, with five serious adverse 
events (13%) in the phenytoin group (but only one attributable to phenytoin) and 
two (5%) in the placebo group.  
Interpretation: These findings support the concept of neuroprotection with 
phenytoin in AON. Inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels should also be 
neuroprotective in other relapses of multiple sclerosis, and could thereby address a 
major unmet therapeutic need.

Introduction 
 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central 
nervous system in which disability arises largely from neuroaxonal loss, which occurs 
in relapses and in progressive phases of the disease1.  Corticosteroids hasten 
recovery from relapses without affecting the final prognosis for recovery2,3,4, and 
immunomodulation has so far had limited effects on progressive disability5. Hence, 
neuroprotection for both processes contributing to disability remains a key unmet 
need in MS.  
Different mechanisms are likely to contribute to neurodegeneration in relapses and 
in progressive disease. In acute relapses, there is growing evidence of a cascade 
arising from neuronal energy failure, leading in turn to reduced activity of the 
membrane Na+-K+ ATPase, accumulation of sodium ions entering mainly via NaV1·6 
channels, reverse operation of the membrane Na+:Ca2+ exchanger, and finally toxic 
accumulation of calcium ions6. NaV1·6 channels in microglia are also likely to play an 
important role in their activation and subsequent immune attack7. Consistent with 
this mechanism, voltage-gated sodium channels inhibitors are neuroprotective in 
several preclinical models of neuroinflammation8-10, suggesting that they may also 
be neuroprotective in MS.  
Phenytoin is a selective sodium channel inhibitor at concentrations therapeutic for 
epilepsy and is neuroprotective at these concentrations in experimental models8-,9,11. 
It can be loaded rapidly to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations within days. 
This property is important because experimental studies indicate that 
neuroprotection for relapses should be started as early as possible during the phase 
of acute inflammatory injury10, an inflammatory penumbra which corresponds to 
approximately the first two weeks of a clinical episode, then potentially sustained 
until beyond the period of active inflammation, which may be detected for a median 
of two months after symptom onset12.  
The anterior visual system has many advantages for testing neuroprotection in MS13: 
acute demyelinating optic neuritis (AON) is a common and often presenting 
manifestation of MS; the inflammatory optic nerve lesion is comparable to plaques 
found elsewhere in the central nervous system; and the visual system can be studied 
using clinical, electrophysiological and imaging techniques. In addition, the optic 
nerve lesion leads to retrograde degeneration of the retinal nerve fibre layer 
(RNFL)14, a relatively pure compartment of unmyelinated axons whose thickness can 
be measured sensitively and non-invasively using optical coherence tomography 
(OCT). Therefore, the RNFL thickness provides a plausible biomarker of axonal loss. 
Reduction of RNFL thickness also corresponds with visual loss in AON and with 
changes of disability in MS, suggesting that it may provide information on treatment 
response that is also clinically relevant 14. 
From these considerations we undertook a phase 2 clinical trial to determine 
whether early and sustained sodium channel inhibition with phenytoin is 
neuroprotective in AON.

Methods 
 
Study design 
We carried out an investigator-led, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. There were two trial centres, in London and 
Sheffield UK. Participants were enrolled between February 2012 and May 2014. The 
study was approved by the London-South East UK Research and Ethics Committee. 
The full protocol is available online: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/queen-square-
multiple-sclerosis-centre/trial-protocol-neuroprotection-with-phenytoin-in-optic-
neuritis 
Participants 
Patients who presented to the trial centres, or were referred there from a UK 
network of Patient Identification Centres, were eligible if they were 18-60 years old, 
had a clinical diagnosis of unilateral AON (confirmed by a neuro-ophthalmologist, 
and with no alternative pathology on OCT at presentation), visual acuity ≤6/9, and an 
interval of ≤14 days between onset of vision loss and randomization. Patients with a 
previous diagnosis of relapsing MS were eligible within 10 years of disease onset and 
with an Expanded Disability Status Scale score ≤3. Concurrent treatment with 
glatiramer acetate or beta-interferon was permitted and corticosteroids for AON 
could be given at the treating physician’s discretion (all participants  were offered 
equivalent regimens of methylprednisolone, either 1 g intravenously daily for three 
days, or 500 mg orally daily for five days15. Exclusions were: previous history of AON 
in either eye, co-morbid ocular disease, clinical or biochemical hepatic, renal or 
cardiac dysfunction (including abnormal electrocardiogram), contraindications to 
phenytoin (including pregnancy), disabling temperature dependent MS symptoms, 
use of sodium or calcium channel inhibitors in the preceding 2 weeks, corticosteroids 
(except for treatment of this episode of AON) or other immune therapies in the 
preceding 2 months, or seropositivity for aquaporin-4 antibodies, tested using a cell-
based assay (Euroimmun UK). All participants gave written informed consent before 
entry. 
Randomisation and masking 
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to phenytoin or placebo via a website 
(www.sealedenvelope.com) by minimisation at 0·75 probability, with time from 
onset (≤7 days, >7 days), Centre (London, Sheffield), prior MS diagnosis (yes/no), 
disease modifying treatment (yes/no), and corticosteroids for AON (yes/no), as 
binary minimisation variables.  The minimising allocation to active vs placebo was 
assigned with 0.75 probability, to reduce predictability. Participants were allocated a 
randomization code by the treating physician, which was matched to a confidential 
treatment list by the study pharmacist to assign participants either to phenytoin or 
placebo (which were identical in appearance). Only the pharmacist was aware of 
treatment allocation. Treating and assessing physicians as well as participants 
remained masked to treatment allocation. 
Procedures 
Participants were loaded orally with a total medication dose of 15mg/kg divided into 
three equal doses, each rounded up to the nearest 50mg, over three days, to achieve 
serum concentrations which are therapeutic for epilepsy, and which, as noted 
earlier, are neuroprotective in experimental models . A daily maintenance dose of 
  
5 
4mg/kg (rounded up to the nearest 50mg, with a maximum of 350mg) was given for 
3 months, and was increased to 6 mg/kg from August 2013 at the recommendation 
of the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee to achieve higher serum drug 
concentrations, as concentrations with the lower dose were considered to be 
subtherapeutic; the protocol was amended accordingly. 58 participants were given 
the lower dose, and 28 the higher dose. Participants were assessed by a treating 
physician after one and three months, and blood samples obtained to measure 
phenytoin concentration.  
Outcomes 
The primary endpoint was mean RNFL thickness in the affected eye at six months, 
measured with OCT.  
Secondary structural endpoints were macular volume (MV), measured with OCT, and 
optic nerve cross-sectional area and lesion length, measured with magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). Secondary clinical endpoints were monocular high and low 
contrast letter visual acuities and colour perception. Latencies and amplitudes of the 
visual evoked potential (VEP) were also measured. Brain MRI was obtained at 
baseline for participants without a prior diagnosis of MS. 
Primary and secondary endpoints were measured at baseline and six months by 
trained staff blinded to treatment allocation. The three-month gap between 
cessation of treatment and the final assessment was designed to allow any 
artefactual effects of sodium channel inhibition (eg pseudoatrophy)16 to reverse 
before the final readout.  
Optical coherence tomography: High resolution spectral domain OCT images 
(Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany, Software V 5·4B) were acquired using 
identical protocols at both sites. Appropriate quality assurance was undertaken to 
ensure comparability, with acceptable inter-rater coefficients of variation for 
measurements of the RNFL (0.51%) and MV (0.45%) . RNFL measurements used a 
3·45 mm diameter circle scan. A fast MV scan (20 x20° field, 25 horizontal B scans, 
ART 9) was also performed. Scans were excluded if they had a signal strength of <25 
or violated international consensus quality control criteria17. 
Magnetic resonance imaging: MR images were obtained on two 3T scanners with 
identical scanning protocols at both sites. Each optic nerve was imaged separately 
and for all acquisitions the imaging plane for the optic nerves was set orthogonal to 
the longitudinal axis of the nerve. 
The following sequences were performed: 1) A multi-dynamic fat-suppressed heavily 
T2-weighted multi-slice “single-shot” two-dimensional (2D) turbo spin echo (TSE)18; 
2) a conventional fat-suppressed T2-weighted 2D-TSE; 3) a T1-weighted fluid 
attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) 2D-TSE. Lesion length and position were 
measured by three independent assessors (RR, AT, MY) masked to treatment 
allocation and participant identity, using a combination of the conventional and 
multidynamic T2 weighted sequences, and rare discrepancies were resolved by 
consensus, still based on  the blinded data. Mean optic nerve cross-sectional area 
was measured by a blinded assessor using a semi-automated contouring technique 
on the baseline and six-month T1 weighted images. Mean lesional baseline and six-
month cross-sectional areas were calculated by registering a baseline T2 lesion mask 
to the six-month T1 scan. Measurements were corrected for the corresponding 
  
6 
baseline mean ‘non–lesional’ cross-sectional area in the unaffected eye by applying 
the T2 lesion mask to baseline unaffected eye T1 images. 
Vision: Low contrast letter scores were measured using retro-illuminated 1·25% and 
2·5% Sloan charts (Precision Vision, La Salle, IL) using best refractive correction for 
each eye at two metres. Best corrected high contrast logMAR visual acuity was 
measured using retro-illuminated Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts 
at 4m. When no letters could be correctly identified a score of 1·7 was assigned. 
Colour vision was assessed using the Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue test and recorded 
as the total error score.  This was assessed under standard daylight conditions using 
daylight linear full spectrum bulbs with a colour temperature of 6,500K in 
participants with a logMAR visual acuity better than 1·0. 
Visual evoked potential: VEPs to reversal achromatic checks (subtending 15 mins of 
arc visual angle) were recorded at both sites according to International Federation of 
Neurophysiology guidelines on a Synergy system in standard background office 
lighting. Responses were recorded from Oz using Fz as reference and Cz as ground. 
Latency and amplitude of the P100 component were measured to one decimal place 
in the replicates. Participants with absent VEP latencies or amplitudes were assigned 
a value of 200 and 0 respectively. At baseline 20 affected eyes in each group had 
their absent VEP latencies and amplitudes replaced this way and none in the 
baseline unaffected eye. At 6 months this replacement was made in three 
participants, all in the active group. Although the 200 value is arbitrary, it is higher 
than the highest measured value in the study – 188. It is therefore conservative to 
include these values at 6 months rather than to exclude them which would have 
reduced the mean latency of the active group.  
Adverse events were recorded, and blood samples taken at each study visit to 
measure full blood count, liver and renal function.   
Statistical analysis 
The target sample size of 45 per arm was chosen to give 80% power to detect a 
treatment effect (reduction of the extent of loss of RNFL thickness) of 50% at 5% 
significance level, whilst allowing for a 20% combined rate of loss to follow-up and 
non-adherence. This was based on 35 per arm calculated from longitudinal OCT data 
on participants with acute demyelinating optic neuritis, as detailed in sample size 
calculations published previously18.  This sample size calculation maximized power 
by assuming an active vs placebo comparison of follow-up affected eye RNFL 
thickness, adjusted for baseline fellow eye RNFL thickness.  The fellow eye was 
chosen because acute swelling in the affected eye makes this eye a poor predictor of 
follow-up thickness, and makes affected eye change uninterpretable.  Normal 
individuals have very similar RNFL thickness in both eyes, so the baseline fellow eye 
thickness provides a reliable estimate of affected eye RNFL thickness prior to AON. 
Henderson et al19 found a correlation of r=0.63 (p=0.007) between the baseline 
fellow eye RNFL and the six-month affected RNFL. 
Accordingly, an ANCOVA analysis method was used, using multiple linear regression 
of the follow-up affected eye RNFL on a trial arm indicator with the following pre-
specified covariates: baseline fellow eye value, centre (binary), days between onset 
and baseline assessment, and whether the participant was prescribed 
corticosteroids at the time of baseline assessment (three categories: no/1-5 days 
prior to assessment/6-30 days prior).  Two planned binary covariates were not used 
  
7 
because of a pre-specified minimum of 10 for their smallest category: “Prior MS” (4 
yes, 82 no) and “Prescribed disease-modifying treatment” (1 yes, 85 no).  Secondary 
outcomes were analyzed similarly, with the corresponding baseline fellow-eye value 
and the same pre-specified covariates. An exception was lesion length, for which the 
baseline fellow eye was not specified as covariate; also, for imaging outcomes only, 
centre was not used as a covariate due to only three participants undergoing MRI at 
one of the sites (Sheffield).      
The primary intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses included all randomized participants 
who were followed up.  Secondary per protocol (PP) analyses, after excluding 
participants with a subsequent further episode of optic neuritis, compared all 
placebo participants with just adherent active participants, defined as having 
phenytoin present in their one-month blood; however, this PP comparison has the 
potential for bias since there is no placebo subset corresponding to the adherent 
active subset.  
Where 
regression 
residuals 
showed 
signs 
of 
non-normality 
and/or 
heteroscedasticity, p-values were checked using a permutation test, but none of the 
reported p-values required correction.  Statistical significance, where referred to, 
indicates p<0·05 and all p-values refer to two-tailed tests. Analyses were conducted 
in Stata 13.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA). 
The study was overseen by a Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee independent of

Results 
Participants were recruited between February 2012 and May 2014, and final 
assessments were performed in December 2014. None of the eligible participants 
had antibodies to aquaporin-4; exclusions for other reasons are detailed in figure 1. 
86 participants (70 London, 16 Sheffield) were randomly assigned to receive 
phenytoin (n=42) or placebo (n=44, Figure 1). The two groups had similar baseline 
characteristics (Table 1). 28 participants (33%) either had a prior diagnosis of MS, or 
were diagnosed with MS upon presentation, while 68 (79%) had brain lesions on 
MRI.  
Five participants were lost to follow up, leaving 81 who attended for assessment of 
the primary outcome at six months (39 phenytoin, 42 placebo). Of these, 10 in the 
phenytoin group were withdrawn from treatment due to skin rash after a mean of 
18·4 days from starting treatment, but continued to be followed up. The remaining 
29 in the phenytoin group were serum adherent (mean serum phenytoin 
concentration 7 mg/L). The combined overall rate of loss to follow-up, withdrawal 
from treatment and non-adherence was 19%.  
RNFL thickness and macular volume remained stable in the unaffected eye, with 
insignificant change between baseline and six months (Table 2). Six-month affected 
RNFL was significantly correlated with baseline unaffected RNFL (r=0·50, p<0·001) 
but not with baseline affected RNFL (r=0·13, p=0·253). 
The mean RNFL thickness in the affected eye fell after 6 months compared with the 
baseline unaffected eye by 23·79 μm (24%) in the placebo group, and 16·69 μm 
(17%) in the phenytoin group, giving a significantly higher mean 6-month affected 
eye RNFL thickness in the phenytoin group compared to placebo (Figure 2).  The ITT 
adjusted phenytoin-placebo mean 6-month affected eye RNFL difference was 7·15 
μm (95% CI 1·08, 13·22; p=0·021), indicating a 30% beneficial treatment effect; the 
corresponding PP adjusted difference was similar, 7·40 μm (95% CI 0·76, 14·04; 
p=0·029). 
The mean macular volume in the affected eye fell after six months compared with 
the baseline unaffected eye by 0·59mm3 (7%) and 0·39 mm3 (4%) in placebo and 
phenytoin groups respectively, giving a significantly higher mean 6-month affected 
eye MV in the phenytoin group compared to placebo (Figure 2).  The ITT adjusted 
phenytoin-placebo mean 6-month affected eye RNFL difference was 0·20 mm3 (95% 
CI 0·06, 0·34; p=0·005), a 34% beneficial treatment effect; the corresponding PP 
adjusted difference was again similar, 0·21 mm3 (95% CI 0·05, 0·36; p=0·010) 
ITT comparison showed no significant difference in optic nerve lesion length 
between the groups at 6 months (mean adjusted active-placebo difference -2·45mm, 
CI 95% -6·97, 2·08, p=0·285). However, there was a borderline significant treatment 
effect on lesional optic nerve cross-sectional area, with an adjusted active-placebo 
difference of 0·40 mm2 (95% CI -0·02, 0·83, p=0·061) a 38% treatment effect. The 
corresponding adjusted difference in cross-sectional area in the PP comparison was 
0·47mm2 (95% CI -0·04, 0·97, p=0·070).  
There were no significant ITT or PP active-placebo differences in visual function, VEP 
latency or amplitude at 6 months (Table 3).  
A number of exploratory analyses were undertaken. In 10 active participants who 
discontinued treatment due to skin rash, the adjusted mean active-placebo 
  
9 
difference in affected eye RNFL thickness was 8·29 μm, similar to the difference 
observed in the whole ITT sample. Primary analysis treatment effects for participants 
with normal and abnormal brain MRI brain scans at baseline were 7·90 (p=0·029) 
and 4·34 (p=0·496) respectively, but the difference was not significant (p=0·629); 
however, the study was not powered to explore such subgroup analyses. There were 
no significant associations in the active group between 1-month phenytoin 
concentrations and any of the primary or secondary outcomes, apart from a 
borderline significant positive correlation with optic nerve cross-sectional area 
(r=0·39, p=0·063). There were no significant correlations between any of the primary 
or secondary outcome measurements and the time from onset of visual loss to 
initiation of treatment.  
Similar proportions of participants in the phenytoin and placebo groups experienced 
adverse events (Table 4). A higher, but non-significant, proportion of participants in 
the active group discontinued the study medication due to an adverse event (in all 
cases this was a maculopapular rash typical of a drug reaction). With the exception 
of a severe rash in one participant, serious adverse events were not attributable to 
phenytoin (Table 5). 63% of participants guessed their treatment allocation 
(p=0.033), due to all patients with skin rashes guessing correctly that they were in 
the active group. When these numbers were excluded, correct guesses lost 
significance (58%, p=0.228).  
There was no impairment of vision or other neurological function with initial loading 
or following withdrawal of phenytoin. None of the participants developed steroid 
dependent visual failure, evidence of neuromyelitis optica, or evidence of other 
causes of optic neuritis, during the follow up period. Demyelinating relapses 
occurred in 17% of participants in the phenytoin group, and 21% in the placebo 
group. Of these, 6 participants had another episode of AON (4 placebo, 2 phenytoin). 
Of these, three (one phenytoin, 2 placebo) affected the contralateral eye. These 
participants were excluded from the per protocol analysis. In total, 13 participants 
experienced an MS defining relapse during the study.

Discussion 
 
In this phase 2 clinical trial, use of phenytoin was associated with a 30% reduction of 
the loss of the RNFL after AON compared to placebo, and of loss of MV by 34%. 
Together with a near significant 38% reduction in loss of optic nerve cross-sectional 
area, these results are consistent with the suggestion   that phenytoin protected the 
compartment comprising the retinal ganglion cells (which make up 34% of macular 
volume) and their axons in the RNFL and optic nerve, and they support the concept 
of neuroprotection with partial inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels in an 
episode of inflammatory demyelination.  
In contrast to the beneficial effects of treatment on structural outcomes, we 
observed no significant treatment effects on visual outcomes or on the VEP.  While 
we cannot exclude the possibility that treatment protected neurons and their axons 
which nevertheless remained non-functional, the findings are perhaps more 
consistent with the floor effect we observed on high contrast visual acuity and VEP 
amplitude, which recovered well in both phenytoin and placebo groups, and with 
the fact that the trial was not powered to detect treatment effects on these and on 
low contrast acuity and colour vision. In addition, we relied on central and whole 
field VEPs to measure optic nerve function, whereas more sensitive determination of 
treatment effects may be possible using multifocal VEPs in future trial designs.   
Translation of tissue protection into improved visual function is also limited by 
redundancy in the anterior visual system20 and neuroplasticity in higher visual areas, 
so that better neuroprotection may be required for improved clinical outcomes in 
reasonably sized trials. For this, trials might consider: 1) more potent and specific 
inhibitors of sodium channels; 2) higher drug concentrations (mean phenytoin 
concentration in this trial were possibly sub-therapeutic); and 3) an earlier window 
of treatment in the evolution of relapse. The last two suggestions are consistent with 
the lack of correlation between structural outcomes and the concentration of 
phenytoin and time to initiation of treatment in the present study. Conversely, our 
results do not place a lower limit on the duration for which treatment is required for 
successful neuroprotection. We treated participants for 3 months, which is beyond 
the interval when gadolinium enhancement indicates inflammation in the optic 
nerve12, yet an exploratory analysis showed improved OCT outcomes in those who 
withdrew after receiving phenytoin for only a mean of 18·4 days. 
Concerning potential sources of bias, it is worth noting that the characteristics of the 
placebo and phenytoin groups at baseline were generally comparable, typical of 
AON, and that the loss of RNFL thickness in the placebo group after 6 months was 
consistent with previous natural history studies of AON19,21. Care was taken to 
exclude patients with atypical AON, and none of the participants developed features 
of conditions such as neuromyelitis optica (for which antibodies were also tested at 
presentation), or chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION). After 
the study started, further immunological subtypes of optic neuritis have been 
suggested (for example those with antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte 
glycoprotein22) and it would be important to include appropriate testing for these 
subtypes in future studies for any differences in their response to neuroprotective 
therapies. In the present study, 41 out of 86 participants had (or later developed) 
MS, or had a clinically isolated syndrome. In keeping with a demyelinating aetiology, 
  
11 
three quarters of participants had brain lesions on MRI at baseline23. Those with and 
without brain lesions could not be distinguished clinically or with other 
measurements at baseline, nor during follow up, suggesting that the study involved 
a largely homogeneous AON population. In addition, there was no statistically 
significant difference in the primary treatment effect between the groups with and 
without brain lesions.  
Baseline low contrast letter acuity, a predictor of RNFL thickness at six months19, was 
noted to be a little worse in the active group. This would bias the active group 
towards a lower six month RNFL thickness. The opposite finding, of a higher six 
month RNFL thickness in the active group, is therefore all the more consistent with a 
neuroprotective treatment effect. 
As expected, there was swelling of the RNFL in the affected eye at baseline, 
supporting the use of the fellow eye RNFL at baseline for comparisons of change in 
the affected eye at follow up. This method is prone to error if the fellow eye is not 
actually normal because of previous and possibly subclinical episodes of AON, but 
this is unlikely to have affected the present study: none of the participants had 
experienced visual symptoms previously, and measurements of the fellow eye 
revealed no significant subclinical abnormalities. Future trial designs may avoid this 
issue by using OCT segmentation methods to compare the retinal ganglion cell layer 
at baseline and follow up in the affected eye alone, since this structure does not 
swell acutely in AON24.  
Corticosteroid treatment at presentation is unlikely to have influenced the main 
neuroprotective findings because care was taken to adjust the analysis for the use 
and timing of corticosteroids. Also, measurements of the RNFL and of MV remained 
stable in the fellow eye in both the phenytoin and placebo groups, and previous 
studies show that corticosteroids do not prevent atrophy of the RNFL25 or optic 
nerve26, nor visual recovery after optic neuritis2.   
A final consideration is the extent to which the study excluded people with AON 
whose contribution might reflect the response to treatment in real world settings. 
The details of participation (Fig 1) suggest that the inclusion criteria excluded mainly 
those with characteristics of AON (eg prolonged symptom duration), or alternative 
causes of visual failure, which would be unlikely to benefit from sodium channel 
blockade: only the 25 out of 188 at screening for inclusion, who declined 
participation, were not able to contribute to the study. If successful, the treatment 
might be offered in addition to a small group with AON currently excluded from the 
study, ie those with typical AON and outside the current age range, or else with 
more severe or longstanding MS. It is unlikely that such a group would be vulnerable 
to any additional risk from the treatment. 
Treatment with phenytoin was generally well tolerated, and was not associated with 
significant abnormalities in the blood count or liver function. We did not observe any 
acute deterioration of vision that might be attributed to conduction block from 
inhibition of sodium currents, nor any rebound deterioration upon withdrawal of 
treatment, effects which had previously been considered to potentially limit the use 
of drugs acting on this target in demyelinating disorders. Only one participant 
experienced a severe adverse reaction, a skin rash, attributable to phenytoin, but 
nine further participants developed minor, self-limiting skin rashes and were 
withdrawn from treatment by the investigators according to protocol. As noted 
  
12 
above (Results) blinding of participants to treatment allocation was unmasked in 
some cases due to skin rashes. While this might have an effect on patient based 
clinical assessment, the primary outcome, which was assessed fully blinded, should 
not be affected. 
As a result of patient withdrawal from treatment, 10 of the 39 active participants 
available at follow-up were classified as non-adherent. While this may affect the 
power of the ITT analysis, the robustness of the results is supported by the 
agreement between the ITT and PP analyses, and the consistency of treatment 
effects in the macula, RNFL and optic nerve; and though there were more missing 
values in the optic nerve analysis, these were due to MRI acquisition problems, 
which are very plausibly missing at random and unlikely to cause bias. 
Our results support the utility of OCT for measuring outcome in future trials of 
neuroprotection in AON, and consolidate the experience of OCT in previous small 
trials of other agents27-29. In comparison to OCT, MRI of the optic nerve is limited by 
the effects of myelin and other supporting tissue, and by lower resolution. OCT is 
also easier to use and costs less.  In the previous trials, memantine reduced the loss 
of the RNFL27, while erythropoietin was effective in one trial28 but not in another29.  
Our study addressed limitations of these studies by correcting measurements in the 
affected eye for baseline measurements in the unaffected eye, and reporting MV 
data as well as more detailed MRI data. 
At the average concentration achieved in this trial, phenytoin is an almost pure 
activity-dependent inhibitor of voltage-gated sodium channels30. By analogy, other 
sodium channel inhibitors could also be neuroprotective in AON and, given its 
similarities to other relapses of MS, in those relapses as well. In turn, the present 
trial design should enable proof of concept of neuroprotection after relapse for 
treatments with other modes of action. Implications for treating progressive MS are 
harder to define because of possible differences in pathophysiology: microglial 
activation is likely to remain important in progressive disease, whereas sodium 
channel expression may change31. Previously, we reported a trial of neuroprotection 
using lamotrigine to inhibit sodium channels in secondary progressive MS16.  
Treatment did not affect the rate of cerebral atrophy, although interpretation was 
hampered by a high rate of non-adherence, and there were positive treatment 
signals, including significant slowing of the rate of deterioration of the timed walk 
and lower serum neurofilament concentrations in the adherent group of 
participants32. 
In conclusion, the results of this clinical trial support the concept of neuroprotection 
using phenytoin to inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels in AON. These results 
should encourage larger, phase 3 trials of sodium channel inhibitors in optic neuritis 
and other relapses of MS. Future studies should also establish more precisely the 
optimal therapeutic window for neuroprotection in relapses.

¶ Pre-specified adjustment for baseline unaffected value, centre, days between 
onset and baseline, days between steroid and baseline; centre was dropped for optic 
nerve area, and centre and baseline unaffected value were dropped for lesion length 
a The six month comparison includes three participants on active drug, and none on 
placebo,with vision too poor to obtain VEP response, for which amplitudes of 0μV 
and latencies of 200ms were used.  The baseline summaries include 20 active and 20 
placebo patients with vision too poor, for which these imputations were used.  All 
the unaffected eye VEPs were recordable.  Excluding the three subjects gives active – 
placebo differences of -0.22, p=0.955 (latency) and 0.36, p=0.647 (amplitude).

Figure 1: Trial profile 
 
 
 
* Reasons for ineligibility were as follows:  
• 
28 visual acuity better than allowed 
• 
11 time to presentation longer than allowed 
• 
5 had bilateral optic neuritis  
• 
3 had previous optic neuritis 
• 
1 treated with long term immunosupression 
• 
9 had an uncertain diagnosis 
• 
20 had alternative diagnoses (4 functional visual loss; 3 sarcoidosis; 2 each: 
migraine with aura, posterior scleritis, Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, 
compressive optic nerve lesions; 1 each: uveitis, toxic optic neuropathy, 
neuroretinitis, central serous retinopathy, optic nerve drusen)

Figure 2:  Retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and macular volume, by trial group.  
Retinal nerve fibre layer thickness in the unaffected and affected eyes at baseline (a) 
and at six months (b); macular volume in the unaffected and affected eyes at 
baseline (c) and at six months (d). Active-placebo comparisons were based on the 
difference between the six month active eye and baseline unaffected eye. Bars are 
standard errors around unadjusted group means.
