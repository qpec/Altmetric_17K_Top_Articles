Abstract
Introduction/Background—Although malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is generally a 
disease associated with more advanced age, the association of age, treatment, and outcomes has 
not been well-characterized. We evaluated the impact of age on outcomes in MPM patients to 
provide data for use in the treatment selection process for elderly patients with potentially 
resectable disease.
Patients & Methods—Overall survival (OS) of patients younger than 70 and 70 years or older 
with Stage I–III MPM who underwent cancer-directed surgery or non-operative management in 
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004–2010) was evaluated using 
multivariable Cox proportional hazard models and propensity score-matched analysis.
Results—Cancer-directed surgery was used in 284 of 879 (32%) patients who met inclusion 
criteria, and was associated with improved OS in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 0.71, 
p=0.001). Cancer-directed surgery was used much less commonly in patients 70 and older 
compared to patients younger than 70 (22% [109/497] versus 46% [175/382], p<0.001), but 
patients 70 and older had improved 1-year (59.4% versus 37.9%) and 3-year (15.4% versus 8.0%) 
OS compared to non-operative management. The benefit of surgery in patients 70 and older was 
observed even after propensity score-matched analysis was used to control for selection bias.
Conclusion—Surgical treatment is associated with improved survival compared to non-operative 
management for both patients younger than 70 years and patients age 70 years or older.

 The impact of age on outcomes in 879 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma was 
evaluated using the SEER database with Cox proportional hazard models and propensity score-
matched analysis. Surgery was found to be associated with improved survival compared to non-
operative management for both patients younger and older than 70 years, suggesting a potential 
benefit of surgery to elderly patients.

Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive cancer with a relatively poor 
prognosis and a median survival of approximately 12 months.1–3 Due to a long latent stage, 
58% of patients diagnosed with MPM are over the age of 70 years upon presentation,4 and 
the incidence of elderly patients diagnosed with MPM globally is increasing.5–10 Although 
increasing age has consistently been shown to be associated with worse survival,3 there are 
very few studies that report specific outcomes among elderly patients. In particular, the 
survival benefit of surgery for elderly patients with MPM has not been clearly 
established.3,11 Quantitative data to support difficult treatment decisions about when to offer 
surgery for elderly MPM patients are needed, as a subset of these patients with favorable 
prognostic factors may experience extended survival by undergoing cancer-directed surgery. 
In the present study, we analyzed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
database from 2004–2010 to evaluate the survival of elderly MPM patients and to determine 
how age impacts the potential benefits of surgery for patients with MPM. Our objective is to 
provide clinicians with quantifiable evidence that can be used in the treatment decision 
process for elderly patients with MPM and to specifically test the hypothesis that surgery is 
associated with survival benefit in elderly patients.
Materials and Methods
This study of the SEER program database was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
at Duke University. Patients included in this study were those 18 years or older with 
epithelioid and biphasic MPM diagnosed between 2004 and 2010. Only cases identified 
from 2004–2010 were evaluated because specific American Joint Committee on Cancer’s 
TMN staging (6th edition)12 information was available in SEER only from 2004 to 2010, as 
staging was categorized as “early” and “late” in earlier SEER periods.13 Patients were 
selected using ICD-O-3 morphology codes 9050–9055. Only patients with known 
nonsarcomatoid histology, laterality and surgery information who had pathologically proven 
stage I, II and III malignant mesothelioma of pleura and lung were included. Only 
epithelioid and biphasic histologies are included, although of note, the pathologic diagnosis 
of biphasic may be dependent on the volume of tissue available for analysis. Patients with 
sarcomatoid histology and stage IV disease were excluded because these patients are 
generally not considered candidates for surgery under current guidelines3. Other exclusion 
criteria are similar to as previously described, including all postmortem cases; any case not

 confirmed microscopically; retroperitoneal, peritoneal, genital, heart, mediastinum, soft 
tissue, digestive, other, and unknown primary site.13 Variables analyzed included age, sex, 
race, marital status, laterality, histology, surgery, stage, year of diagnosis, vital status and 
time to last available reported survival time point. Chemotherapy information is not recorded 
in the SEER database.
Patients were stratified into subgroups based on age and SEER-recorded TNM stage. The 
primary analysis examined the effects of patient age strata and stage on overall survival of 
patients undergoing cancer-directed surgery and non-operative management. Differences in 
patient and treatment characteristics were assessed using Pearson’s chi-square test for 
categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. Overall survival 
analyses for patients, stratified by age and treatment, were performed by Kaplan-Meier 
analysis. For the entire cohort, predictors of survival were calculated using a multivariable 
Cox proportional hazards model. In an attempt to better identify patients who were likely to 
benefit from surgery, separate multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were 
performed to estimate predictors of survival for patients who had undergone cancer-directed 
surgery, and for patients age 80 years and older. Covariates included in both Cox models 
were known age, sex, race, marital status, laterality, radiation use, histology, and disease 
stage (I, II, III), according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer’s Cancer Staging 
Manual, 6th ed.12
A propensity-matched analysis which aimed to create a cohort of non-operative patients 
who, based on known and possible confounders, would have a similar propensity to receive 
a cancer-directed operation as the patients undergoing cancer-directed surgery was 
performed as previously described to attempt to control for nonrandom differences between 
patients who did and did not have cancer-directed surgery.14 Briefly, to assess the potential 
impact of age on the survival of cancer-directed surgery, patients were stratified into 2 
groups: patients younger than 70 years old and patients 70 years or older. The patient- and 
disease-related variables chosen for the matching algorithm were felt to most likely act as 
confounders and were entered into a logistic regression model to calculate propensity scores; 
a radius matching algorithm was used to find the most appropriate matched pairs. After 
propensity score matching, differences between groups were assessed using standard 
summary statistics. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess overall survival across 
groups.
Cancer-directed surgery was defined from the SEER “surgery of the primary site” code and 
included codes 30 (simple partial surgical removal of primary site), 40 (total surgical 
removal of primary site), 50 (surgery stated to be “debulking”), and 60 (radical surgery). 
Because it is possible that some of these surgical procedures were palliative and not curative 
in intent, a sensitivity analysis was performed analyzing only patients who received surgery 
coded as “total surgical removal of primary site” and “radical surgery” in the SEER database 
to better estimate the true impact of curative-intent surgery.
Model diagnostics were assessed, no major model assumptions were violated, an affirmative 
decision was made to control for type I error at the level of the comparison and a p value 
<0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance for all comparisons and analyses. All

Results
Baseline Characteristics
A total of 879 patients with stage I–III malignant pleural mesothelioma of non-sarcomatoid 
histology from 2004 through 2010 were identified for inclusion in this study. Cancer-
directed surgery was used in 32% (n=284) of these patients. Baseline demographic, 
treatment, and tumor characteristics of patients who were managed non-operatively and 
patients who underwent surgery are detailed in Table 1. Patients treated with surgery were 
younger, had higher clinical stage disease, slightly higher frequency of biphasic disease, and 
were more likely to be married than patients who did not have surgery. Radiation therapy 
overall was used in the minority of patients, but was more likely to be used in patients who 
were also treated with surgery. The 30-day mortality of patients who did not receive surgery 
was 11.7% versus 4.3% for patients who underwent surgery (p=0.001).
Survival Analysis of Patients who underwent Non-operative management vs Cancer-
directed Surgery
Surgery was associated with better survival compared to non-operative management in 
univariate analysis (p<0.001, Figure 1). Specifically, the improvements in survival associated 
with surgery over non-operative management were observed both in the short-term (1-year 
survival 63% [95% CI, 57–69%] vs 44% [95% CI, 39–48%]) and mid-term (3-year survival 
21% [95% CI, 16–27%] vs 11% [95% CI, 8–15%]). However, long term survival was poor 
for both groups (5-year survival 8% [95% CI, 4–14%] vs 3% [95% CI, 1–6%]) (Figure 1). In 
the Cox proportional hazards survival model, adjusted for available baseline characteristics 
(Table 2), use of cancer-directed surgery (HR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.58–0.86; p=0.001) was the 
strongest predictor of improved survival. Age (HR 1.03; 95%CI: 1.02–1.03; p<0.001) and 
biphasic histology (HR 1.51; 95% CI: 1.22–1.86; p<0.001) were associated with worse 
survival. These results did not significantly change in the sensitivity analysis that only 
included patients who were more likely have undergone curative-intent surgery (data not 
shown).
Outcomes stratified by age group
Baseline demographic characteristics and treatment for patients stratified by age younger 
than 70 years and 70 years and older are detailed in Table 3. As shown in the table, surgery 
was used much less often in the older group. However, cancer-directed surgery was 
associated with significantly better overall survival compared to non-operative management 
in univariate analysis for both patients younger than 70 years (p=0.01, Figure 2A) and 70 
years and older (p<0.001, Figure 2B). The 30-day mortality of patients younger than 70 and 
those 70 and older was 4.6% and 13.0%, respectively (p<0.001). Table 4 details the short-
term, mid-term, and long-term survival associated with surgery over non-operative 
management.

 Survival Analysis of Patients who underwent Cancer-directed Surgery
Although both older and younger patient age groups obtained benefit from surgery, older age 
was a predictor of worse survival in survival analysis that only included patients who 
underwent cancer-directed surgery. Age less than 70 years was associated with superior 
survival when compared to age 70 and over (p=0.03) (Figure 3). In the Cox proportional 
hazards survival model, adjusted for available baseline characteristics (Table 5) and limited 
to patients who had undergone cancer-directed surgery, increasing age and biphasic 
histology were associated with worse survival.
Propensity analysis
Comparison of baseline patient characteristics after propensity matching between patients 
who underwent non-operative management and patients who underwent cancer-directed 
surgery, stratified by age younger than 70 or 70 years and older, is shown in Table 6. After 
propensity matching, there were no statistically significant differences between the operative 
and non-operative groups in any of the patient characteristics, and cancer-directed surgery 
continued to be associated with significantly better overall survival for both patients younger 
and older than 70 years (Figure 4A and Figure 4B). For patients younger than 70 years, the 
30-day mortality was 5.7% in the non-operative group and 3.4% in the surgery group 
(p=0.46). For patients 70 years and older, the 30-day mortality was 12.8% in the non-
operative group and 10.1% in the surgery group (p=0.60). These results did not significantly 
change when we focused the analysis to only patients who underwent likely curative-intent 
surgery.
Survival analysis of patients 80 years and older
The 1-, 3- and 5- year survival of patients 80 years and older of age was 34.1% (95% CI, 
27.1–41.3%), 4.3% (95% CI, 1.5–9.4%), and 0.0% (95% CI, NA), respectively (Figure 5). 
Patients who are over 80 and underwent non-operative management have similar 1-, 3- and 
5- year survival (34.3% [95% CI, 26.9–41.9%], 3.8% [95% CI, 1.1–9.4%] and 0.0% [95% 
CI, NA]), respectively, when compared with patients over 80 who underwent surgery (32.2% 
[95% CI, 12.2–54.3%], 6.4% [95% CI, 0.0–25.2%] and 0.0% [95% CI, NA]. In a separate 
Cox proportional hazards survival model limited to only patients 80 years old or greater, 
surgery was not associated with improved survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI: 0.57–1.61; p=0.87).
Discussion
In this population-based study, we found that age was an important determinant both for 
survival and for the use of cancer-directed surgery. Patients age 70 and older were much less 
likely to have surgery compared to younger patients. Patients 70 years and older who 
underwent cancer-directed surgery had a worse survival compared to patients younger than 
70 years, but surgery was associated with higher survival when compared to non-operative 
management in both patient age groups. However, in a subset analysis of patients greater 
than 80 years old, we found that surgery did not confer a survival advantage after 
multivariable adjustment. These data suggest that while patients >70 years can still derive 
clear benefit from surgery, these potential advantages may not translate in patients >80 
years.

 This data can be used by clinicians when considering treatment for older patients with 
MPM, as currently available evidence generally does not include a significant amount of 
elderly patients or provide specific estimates of the impact of age on outcomes. While 
virtually every study of mesothelioma has shown that increased age is associated with worse 
survival,3 the majority of these studies have a median age ranging from 57 to 63 
years10,11,15–22 and there are very few studies that report specific outcomes for elderly 
patients (>70 years). Spaggiari et al. reported the outcomes of 518 patients with MPM who 
underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy, of whom 62 patients were greater than 70 years15 
and had 1-, and 3-year survivals of 58% and 16%. In 2008, Ceresoli et al. reported the 
outcomes of 48 elderly patients > 70 years who had participated in two phase II trials of 
pemetrexed and carboplatin and were not surgical candidates; 1-year survival for these 
patients was 48%. In 2014, Ceresoli et al. reported the outcomes of 241 patients with MPM 
aged 70 years and older, of whom 18 had underwent surgery. The authors did not report the 
survival for patients who underwent surgery, but did note that for their entire cohort, median 
overall survival was 11.4 months and age > 75 years was associated with worse survival in 
multivariable analysis.10 Our study, with a median age of 74 and 67 in the non-operative and 
surgical groups, respectively, has an older population than most studies of MPM 
patients,10,11,15–22 although our survival results are comparable to those reported by 
Spaggiari and colleagues and Ceresoli and colleagues.
Advantages of using SEER data for this study include the large number of patients available 
for analysis from an unbiased population-based registry, with volume sufficient to perform 
subgroup analyses. The limitations of the current study are similar to as previously 
discussed4,23 and these include lack of information regarding patient comorbidities, 
socioeconomic status, chemotherapy regimens, details regarding the operation, and details 
regarding clinical and pathologic staging. We would expect that most patients would have 
received some form of chemotherapy in addition to cancer-directed surgery to ensure 
complete removal of microresidual disease;24,25 however, there are no details in the SEER 
database regarding the specific treatment type and duration. Another limitation of the SEER 
database is that it does not provide details on the type of cancer-directed surgery the patient 
received. Therefore, our results may have included patients who received palliative-intent 
surgery and may underestimate the impact of curative-intent surgery. To better evaluate 
whether curative-intent surgery is beneficial, a sensitivity analysis was performed analyzing 
only patients who received surgery coded as “total surgical removal of primary site” and 
“radical surgery” in the SEER database. The results from this analysis were consistent with 
the results from our primary analysis of patients receiving any type of cancer-directed 
surgery. An additional limitation, which has been discussed in detail previously,23 is with 
regards to staging data recorded in the SEER database. In SEER, the tumor stage that is 
recorded is based on pathological information when surgery was the initial cancer-directed 
therapy, and clinical information if patients had neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery, or if 
surgery was not performed.23 Thus, patients in the operative group had pathologic staging 
recorded, and patients in the non-operative group had clinical staging recorded. In the 
present study, patients in the surgery group had higher disease stage, which is consistent 
with previous findings from studies showing that clinical staging underestimates disease 
extent.26,27

 In summary, surgical treatment of mesothelioma is associated with improved long-term 
outcomes, even among the elderly, in a national population-based cancer database. Although 
this database has inherent limitations, the analysis does suggest that appropriately selected 
elderly patients potentially derive benefit from surgery. While these results cannot be used to 
show definitive benefit to surgery in all elderly patients, the analysis does suggest that 
advanced age alone should not be used as an absolute contraindication to surgery and that 
even elderly patients should go through a multidisciplinary evaluation to decide if surgery 
should be part of their treatment regimen. While patients older than 70 years may potentially 
derive clear benefit from surgery, these potential advantages may not translate in patients 
older than 80 years. Future research should focus on evaluating the comorbidities and 
characteristics that are most important in the elderly population to optimize both 
perioperative outcomes and long-term survival.

 Clinical Practice Points
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive cancer associated with 
poor survival. It is known that increased age is associated with worse survival, but few 
studies report outcomes for patients with mesothelioma of advanced stage. In particular, 
the survival benefit of surgery for elderly patients with MPM has not been clearly 
established. In this study, surgery was found to be associated with improved survival 
compared to non-operative management for both MPM patients younger and older than 
70 years, even after propensity-score matching. The analysis suggests that surgery 
confers potential survival benefit to appropriately selected elderly patients and that 
advanced age alone should not be an absolute contraindication to surgery. Based on the 
study findings, elderly patients with MPM should go through a multidisciplinary 
evaluation to decide if surgery should be part of their treatment regimen.
