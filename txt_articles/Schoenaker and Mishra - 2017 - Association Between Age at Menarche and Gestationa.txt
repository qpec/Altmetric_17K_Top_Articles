In this study, we aimed to examine the association between age at menarche and gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM). Data were from 4,749 women participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health be-
tween 2000 and 2012. Age at menarche was reported at baseline in 2000 when women were aged 22–27 years.
During 12 years of follow-up, information on GDM diagnosis was obtained for each live birth. Log-binomial regres-
sion analysis was used to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Analyses adjusted for mother’s
highest completed educational qualification, nulliparity, polycystic ovary syndrome, physical activity, and body
mass index. Mean age at menarche was 12.9 years (standard deviation, 1.4). A first diagnosis of GDM was re-
ported by 357 women (7.5%). Compared with women with menarche at age 13 years, women who had their first
menstruation at age ≤11 years had a 51% higher risk of developing GDM (95% confidence interval: 1.10, 2.07)
after adjustment for GDM risk factors. Our findings indicate that a young age at menarche may identify women at
higher risk of GDM. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings and to elucidate the role of
early-life exposures in age at menarche and subsequent GDM risk.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing globally,
with the greatest rise occurring in adults under 50 years of
age (1, 2). It has therefore become increasingly important to
identify risk factors that can be used to promote early pre-
vention. Results from a meta-analysis by Janghorbani et al.
(3) suggested that younger age at menarche (age at onset of
first menstruation in girls) is associated with higher risk of
type 2 diabetes. Age at menarche is determined by genetic
and environmental factors during the perinatal period and
childhood (4), and these findings support the “developmen-
tal origins of health and disease” hypothesis that early-life
influences can alter the risk of later disease.
Type 2 diabetes shares many features with gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM). Pregnancy has been indicated as a
“stress test” for type 2 diabetes relatively early in life, as
more than 50% of women with GDM develop type 2 dia-
betes within 5–10 years following pregnancy (5). GDM is
an increasingly common complication of pregnancy, and it
has long-lasting health consequences for both mothers and
their children (5–7). Examining the association between age
at menarche and risk of developing GDM is of significant
clinical and public health importance, given the global
trends of declining age at menarche and increasing preva-
lence of obesity and GDM (2, 8). Identification of women at
risk of GDM at an early life stage may allow early health
monitoring and intervention. Current evidence on the asso-
ciation between menarche and GDM is limited to inconsis-
tent findings from 2 previously published US studies (9, 10).
Younger age at menarche was associated with higher risk of
GDM among women in Nurses’ Health Study II (9) but not
in the Omega Cohort Study (10). The association needs fur-
ther investigation in different populations.
The aim of this analysis was to examine the relationship
between age at menarche and development of GDM in a

 population-based study of reproductive-aged Australian
women.
METHODS
Study design and participants
The Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health
(ALSWH) is an ongoing population-based cohort study of
factors affecting the health and well-being of Australian
women. Women were randomly selected from the national
Medicare health insurance database, which includes all Aus-
tralian citizens and permanent residents. Women living in
rural and remote areas were intentionally oversampled. Full
details on the study design, recruitment methods, and re-
sponse rates have been published previously (11, 12).
Our analysis included data from a cohort of women born
between 1973 and 1978. The first ALSWH survey, carried
out in 1996, was completed by a nationally representative
sample of 14,427 women aged 18–23 years (11). Self-
administered questionnaires were sent to participants every
3–4 years. Response rates for surveys 2–6 were 67.2%
(n = 9,688), 62.9% (n = 9,081), 63.4% (n = 9,145), 56.8%
(n = 8,200), and 55.5% (n = 8,009) of baseline response, re-
spectively. Nonresponse was found to be related to baseline
characteristics (less education, financial stress, smoking,
being unmarried, and having no children); however, esti-
mates of longitudinal associations were found not to be
biased by the loss to follow-up (13). Age at menarche was
reported in survey 2 in 2000 (ages 22–27 years), and this
was used as the baseline for the present study. Our study in-
cluded 4,749 women who reported a live birth in at least 1
of the consecutive surveys carried out in 2003 (survey 3,
ages 25–30 years), 2006 (survey 4, ages 28–33 years), 2009
(survey 5, ages 31–36 years), and 2012 (survey 6, ages
34–39 years); had no history of GDM or type 1 or type 2
diabetes; and had no missing data on age at menarche,
GDM, or relevant covariates (see Web Figure 1, available at
http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).
Age at menarche
Age at menarche was assessed in survey 2 when the wom-
en were aged 22–27 years, using the question, “What age
were you when you had your first menstrual period?” Age at
menarche was reported in years and was categorized as ≤11,
12, 13, 14, or ≥15 years.
Gestational diabetes mellitus
GDM was ascertained from self-reported physician
diagnosis in each survey and for each live birth, using the
question, “Were you diagnosed or treated for gestational
diabetes?” Women with GDM before survey 2 (baseline)
were excluded. Incidence of GDM was defined as a first
case of GDM between survey 2 (2000) and survey 6
(2012). During the study period, diagnostic criteria for
GDM in Australia included a 1-hour venous plasma glu-
cose level greater than or equal to 7.8 mmol/L after a 50-g
glucose load or a 1-hour venous plasma glucose level
greater than or equal to 8.0 mmol/L after a 75-g glucose
load. Diagnosis was confirmed with a 75-g oral glucose
tolerance test (fasting) with a venous plasma glucose level
of ≥5.5 mmol/L at 0 hours and/or a venous plasma glucose
level of ≥8.0 mmol/L at 2 hours (14). Australia has a stan-
dard of universal GDM screening of all women (15). A reli-
ability study carried out in a subgroup of women from
New South Wales (n = 1,914) demonstrated high agree-
ment (91%) between self-reported GDM diagnosis in our
study and administrative data records (16).
Covariates
Self-reported information on birth weight, weight during
childhood (age 10 years), mother’s highest educational
qualification, the participant’s own highest educational
qualification, nulliparity, and diagnosis of polycystic ovary
syndrome was collected at baseline. Physical activity
scores were derived from validated questions on frequency
and duration of walking (for recreation or transport) and re-
ported information on moderate- and vigorous-intensity
physical activity in the last week. Level of physical activity
was categorized as sedentary/low (<600 metabolic equiva-
lent of task (MET)-minutes/week), moderate (600–1,199
MET-minutes/week), or high (≥1,200 MET-minutes/week)
(17). Body mass index (BMI) was computed as weight (kg)
divided by the square of height (m) and was categorized as
underweight (BMI <18.5), healthy weight (BMI 18.5–24.9),
overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9), or obese (BMI ≥30.0). Wom-
en who were pregnant at the time of the survey were asked
to report their prepregnancy weight.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were determined for women who
developed and did not develop GDM during follow-up ac-
cording to categories of age at menarche. Differences be-
tween groups were compared using t tests, analysis of
variance, or χ2 tests.
Log-binomial regression analysis was used to estimate
relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for the associ-
ation between age at menarche and incident GDM. Covari-
ates were identified based on a priori knowledge of common
causes for age at menarche and GDM (confounders), as well
as known adulthood risk factors for GDM that may also be
associated with age at menarche (potential mediators).
Backward selection was used to identify relevant covariates,
with those that did not affect the estimates not being in-
cluded in the final models. We adjusted for mother’s highest
educational qualification as a marker of early-life exposures
in the first model, before adjusting for the baseline factors
nulliparity, polycystic ovary syndrome, physical activity
(model 2), and BMI (model 3). Birth weight and weight dur-
ing childhood (age 10 years) were not included in the mod-
els, since these were no longer significant covariates when
baseline/adulthood BMI was taken into account. Adjustment
for maternal age, country of birth, the woman’s own highest
completed educational qualification, total energy intake, and
previous macrosomia did not change the estimates.

 We conducted additional analyses to test the consistency
of our findings. First, to evaluate effect modification and
identify potential differences in the magnitude of the associ-
ation between age at menarche and GDM risk in subgroups
of women, we included an interaction term in the model and
performed analyses stratified by risk factors for GDM, in-
cluding birth weight, weight during childhood, mother’s and
participant’s own highest completed educational qualifica-
tion, diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, parity, phys-
ical activity, and BMI. Second, in addition to adjusting the
association for baseline BMI, we examined the influence of
timing of BMI by including prepregnancy BMI at the time
of the survey prior to the index pregnancy as a covariate in
the analysis. Third, we compared baseline characteristics of
women included in and excluded from the analysis due to
missing covariate data using t tests or χ2 tests. A multiple
imputation analysis was performed to assess the influence of
participant exclusions that resulted from missing covariate
data (18). The following SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
North Carolina) procedure was performed. First, PROC MI
was used to create 20 imputed data sets. Covariates included
in the regression analysis, as well as variables on the wom-
an’s own highest completed educational qualification, total
energy intake, birth weight, childhood weight, BMI at the
time of the survey prior to baseline (survey 1; 1996) and the
survey after baseline (survey 3; 2003), preferred weight,
number of times the woman had been on a diet, and number
of times the woman had lost weight on purpose, were in-
cluded in the imputation model. Second, log-binomial re-
gression analyses were performed on each of the imputed
data sets. Third, these results were then analyzed using
MIANALYZE to create combined estimates and confidence
intervals that appropriately accounted for the variance
within and between imputed data sets. Lastly, to examine
the potential influence of unequal follow-up due to attrition,
we performed survival analysis. Survival time for each wom-
an was defined as the time from baseline to GDM pregnancy
or loss to follow-up, whichever came first.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software,
version 9.4. P values less than 0.05 were considered statis-
tically significant.
RESULTS
Among 4,749 women aged 25 years (standard deviation
(SD), 1.4) at baseline who reported having a live birth dur-
ing 12 years of follow-up, 357 women (7.5%) reported a
first diagnosis of GDM. Women who developed GDM
were, at baseline, more likely to not know their mother’s
highest educational qualification, to be nulliparous (no pre-
vious births), to be sedentary or have a low physical activity
level, to be overweight or obese, and to have a diagnosis of
polycystic ovary syndrome (Table 1).
Women had a mean age at menarche of 12.9 years (SD,
1.4). Those with early menarche (≤11 years) were more
likely to report being overweight in childhood and to have a
mother with a low level of education or an unknown highest
educational qualification (Table 2). These women were also
more likely to have a sedentary/low physical activity level
and to be overweight or obese at baseline.
Women with early menarche (≤11 years) had a signifi-
cantly higher risk of developing GDM (relative risk
(RR) = 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23, 2.30) than
women with an age at menarche of 13 years (Table 3, crude
model). This association was slightly attenuated after adjust-
ment for mother’s highest completed educational qualifica-
tion (RR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.27) and when baseline
nulliparity, diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, and
physical activity were taken into account (RR = 1.65, 95%
CI: 1.20, 2.25). Additional adjustment for BMI in the final
model attenuated the estimate further, but the association re-
mained significant, showing a 51% higher risk of GDM for
women with early menarche (95% CI: 1.10, 2.07). For each
year of earlier menarche, risk of developing GDM was 10%
higher (95% CI: 1.02, 1.18) after adjustment for all relevant
GDM risk factors (Table 3).
The association between younger age at menarche and
GDM was not significantly modified by birth weight, weight
during childhood, mother’s or participant’s own highest
educational qualification, diagnosis of polycystic ovary syn-
drome, parity, physical activity, or BMI (all P’s for inter-
action > 0.20). BMI increased slightly over time, from a
mean of 23.5 (SD, 4.5) at survey 2 to 25.4 (SD, 5.2) at sur-
vey 6; however, results were similar when adjusting for pre-
pregnancy BMI at baseline or at the time of the survey prior
to the index pregnancy (data not shown).
Compared with women who were included in the anal-
ysis (n = 4,749), women who were excluded because of
missing covariate data (n = 919) were more likely to have
a mother with an unknown highest educational qualifica-
tion, to have a lower educational qualification themselves,
to be parous (to have given birth at least once), and to have
a sedentary/low level of physical activity (Web Table 1).
No significant differences were found between included
and excluded women regarding age at menarche, GDM in-
cidence, and BMI. Conclusions on the association between
age at menarche and GDM remained similar in an analysis
where missing covariate data were imputed (Web Table 2).
Women who were lost to follow-up were less likely to de-
velop GDM (6.8% of women followed up for 3 years de-
veloped GDM (n = 4,631), as compared with 7.7% who
were followed up for the full 12 years (n = 4,073)). How-
ever, the mean age at menarche and the proportion of
women with early menarche did not differ according to
follow-up time of 3, 6, 9, or 12 years (mean age at menar-
che = 12.9 years (SD, 1.4); menarche at age ≤11 years:
12.5% of women). Results derived using survival analysis
were similar to those derived with log-binomial regression
(data not shown), indicating that the unequal follow-up
due to attrition did not influence our findings.
DISCUSSION
Findings from this population-based cohort study of Aus-
tralian women indicated that earlier menarche is signifi-
cantly associated with higher risk of developing GDM
among women who report a live birth during 12 years of

 follow-up. Compared with women who had their first men-
struation at age 13 years, women with menarche at or before
age 11 years had a 51% higher risk of GDM after control for
early-life, reproductive, and lifestyle factors and BMI.
We are aware of 2 previously published studies from the
United States that have examined this association (9, 10). In
the Omega Cohort Study, Dishi et al. (10) recruited women
who visited prenatal care clinics prior to 16 weeks’ gestation
and followed them until delivery (n = 3,490). Age at menar-
che was not associated with GDM in these women (10). Al-
though a similar proportion of women had early menarche
(14.5% at age ≤11 years) as in our population-based study
(12.5%), women participating in the Omega Cohort Study
had higher educational levels, were more likely to be parous
at baseline, were less likely to be overweight or obese before
pregnancy, and had a lower prevalence of GDM (5.3% vs.

In line with our study, among 27,482 women in Nurses’
Health Study II, age at menarche ≤11 years was associated
with higher risk of developing GDM after adjustment for age,
parity, family history of diabetes, smoking, oral contraceptive
use, physical activity, birth weight, and childhood BMI
(RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.58) as compared with women
with menarche at age ≥14 years (9). In contrast to our find-

 Nurses’ Health Study II was comparable with that in our
study (approximately 40% among women with early menar-
che), differences such as the larger proportion of parous
women (60% as compared with 15% in our study), the older
mean age at pregnancy (34 years (SD, 4.0) as compared
with 29 years (SD, 4.5)), and the inclusion of recurrent cases
(346 of 1,404 cases, compared with merely incident cases in
our study), may have contributed to the inconsistency with
our findings.
Several cohort studies from different countries have ex-
amined the association between age at menarche and risk of
type 2 diabetes among nonpregnant populations. In a meta-
analysis including 315,428 women from 3 cross-sectional
studies and 7 prospective cohort studies that adjusted for
BMI, risk of type 2 diabetes was 22% higher (95% CI: 1.17,
1.28) for the lowest category of age at menarche compared
with the middle or highest category (3). Even though the
overall summary estimate showed significantly increased
risk of type 2 diabetes, individual study findings were incon-
sistent (3). Of the 10 studies included, 3 studies found no as-
sociation (19–21) and 2 studies showed an association
between younger age at menarche and higher risk of type 2
diabetes (22, 23); however, in 5 studies included in the
meta-analysis, this association appeared to be completely
mediated through adult BMI (24–28). The 2 studies that
found an association that was independent of adulthood
BMI included both pre- and postmenopausal women,
whereas studies that did not find an association included
only postmenopausal women (3). Moreover, early menarche
was associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes after ad-
justment for adulthood BMI in younger women in Nurses’
Health Study II, but not in older women in the Nurses’
Health Study (26). This may suggest that other pathways be-
yond BMI, such as hormonal changes, play a role in the as-
sociation between menarche and younger onset of type 2
diabetes (3, 26). This is in line with our finding that BMI did
not completely attenuate the relationship between early
menarche and GDM in our population of reproductive-aged
women.
Several biological mechanisms may explain the associ-
ation between earlier menarche and higher risk of GDM. A
potential pathway may be excessive growth and adiposity in
childhood leading to earlier menarche (29), which in turn is
associated with greater accumulation of adipose tissue that
increases the risk of elevated blood glucose levels and insu-
lin resistance (30, 31), thereby increasing risk of developing
GDM. The nature of the association between earlier menar-
che and greater adulthood adiposity remains unclear; how-
ever, this might reflect the higher childhood body fatness in
girls with earlier menarche and the tracking trajectory of
BMI from childhood to adulthood (32). In our study, we
found that birth weight and childhood weight were no long-
er significant covariates of the association between age at
menarche and GDM when adulthood BMI was taken into
account. The association was substantially attenuated after
additional adjustment for adulthood BMI. Younger age at
menarche is a risk factor for overweight and obesity, which
in turn is a strong risk factor for GDM, indicating that BMI
may lie on the causal pathway of this association.
Despite the large attenuation resulting from adjustment
for BMI, a strong inverse association persisted, suggesting
that in addition to BMI, additional pathways beyond adipos-
ity play a role. Higher estrogen levels and lower sex
hormone-binding globulin levels may be associated with
earlier menarche and have been suggested to play a role in
the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (33, 34). An association
between timing of menarche and GDM independent of BMI
may therefore be biologically plausible through hormone
exposure and changes in glucose metabolism. Genetic fac-
tors may be another possible cause of the higher GDM risk
among women with early menarche. Timing of menarche
has a high degree of heritability; it is estimated to be be-
tween 57% and 82% (35, 36). In animal studies, it was
found that overexpression of the mouse Lin-28 homolog A

Age at Menarche and Gestational Diabetes

 (C. elegans) gene (Lin28a) results in both delayed puberty
and insulin sensitivity and glucose intolerance (37, 38), sug-
gesting a possible direct link between early menarche and
diabetes risk. Childhood diet (39) and exposure to stress
during early life, such as family conflict, divorce, and abuse
(4), are potentially modifiable common causes of young age
at menarche and GDM (40); however, further studies are
needed to examine whether and to what extent early menar-
che can be prevented during childhood.
Strengths of this study include the prospective design and
the large sample size. Furthermore, the ALSWH is a nation-
ally representative population-based study, and results are
generalizable to the Australian population of reproductive-
aged women (11, 13). We adjusted for a wide range of
GDM risk factors, including childhood and adulthood risk
factors. A number of limitations of the study should be ac-
knowledged as well. First, age at menarche was self-
reported and recalled at ages 22–27 years, which could have
caused misclassification. Reporting of age at menarche
could not have been influenced by the subsequent develop-
ment of GDM, however, because of the prospective design
of the study. Moreover, previous studies have shown that
age at menarche is usually well recalled into adulthood (41,
42). Second, the use of self-reported GDM may have intro-
duced bias; however, reliability of self-reported GDM diag-
nosis in our study population showed high agreement with
administrative records (16). The universal GDM screening
policy in Australia minimizes the risk of missing cases (15).
Third, even though extensive data have been collected on
many population characteristics, we were not able to control
for some potential confounding factors. Age at menarche
and GDM may share several risk factors during early life. In
our study, we adjusted for mother’s highest educational
qualification as a marker for early childhood exposures;
however, no information was available on perinatal charac-
teristics such as maternal nutrition and disease or on other
early-life factors (40). Unmeasured or imprecisely measured
factors may have confounded the association.
In conclusion, younger age at menarche was associated
with a significantly higher risk of GDM after control for
known GDM risk factors. A history of early menarche may
be clinically useful for identifying women at higher risk of
developing GDM. Adjustment for adulthood BMI as a po-
tential pathway resulted in substantial attenuation but did
not fully explain the association, suggesting that avoidance
of adulthood overweight and obesity by women with early
menarche may lower their risk of GDM. Our findings sug-
gest that age at menarche may be important in the etiology
of GDM, but these results require replication in other study
populations. Future studies starting before menarche, or
even prenatally, are needed to elucidate the role of early-life
exposures and weight trajectories in the association between
age at menarche and subsequent risk of GDM.
