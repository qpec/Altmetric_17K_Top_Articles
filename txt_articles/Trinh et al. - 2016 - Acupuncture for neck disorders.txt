Background
Neck pain is one of the three most frequently reported complaints of the musculoskeletal system. Treatments for neck pain are varied,
as are perceptions of benefit. Acupuncture has been used as an alternative to more conventional treatment for musculoskeletal pain.
This review summarises the most current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture for acute, subacute and chronic neck
pain. This update replaces our 2006 Cochrane review update on this topic.
Objectives
To determine the effects of acupuncture for adults with neck pain, with focus on pain relief, disability or functional measures, patient
satisfaction and global perceived effect.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Manual, Alternative and
Natural Therapy Index System (MANTIS), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Index to
Chiropractic Literature (ICL) from their beginning to August 2015. We searched reference lists, two trial registers and the acupuncture
database Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS) in China to 2005.
Selection criteria
We included published trials that used random assignment to intervention groups, in full text or abstract form. We excluded quasi-
randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors made independent decisions for each step of the review: article inclusion, data abstraction and assessment of quality
of trial methods. We assessed study quality by using the Cochrane Back Review Group ’Risk of bias’ tool. We used consensus to resolve
disagreements, and when clinical heterogeneity was absent, we combined studies by using random-effects meta-analysis models.

 Main results
Of the 27 included studies, three represented individuals with whiplash-associated disorders (WADs) ranging from acute to chronic (205
participants), five explored chronic myofascial neck pain (186 participants), five chronic pain due to arthritic changes (542 participants),
six chronic non-specific neck pain (4011 participants), two neck pain with radicular signs (43 participants) and six subacute or chronic
mechanical neck pain (5111 participants).
For mechanical neck pain, we found that acupuncture is beneficial at immediate-term follow-up compared with sham acupuncture for
pain intensity; at short-term follow-up compared with sham or inactive treatment for pain intensity; at short-term follow-up compared
with sham treatment for disability; and at short-term follow-up compared with wait-list control for pain intensity and neck disability
improvement. Statistical pooling was appropriate for acupuncture compared with sham for short-term outcomes due to statistical
homogeneity (P value = 0.83; I2 = 20%). Results of the meta-analysis favoured acupuncture (standardised mean difference (SMD) -
0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.20 to -0.07; P value = 0.0006). This effect does not seem sustainable over the long term. Whether
subsequent repeated sessions would be successful was not examined by investigators in our primary studies.
Acupuncture appears to be a safe treatment modality, as adverse effects are minor. Reported adverse effects include increased pain,
bruising, fainting, worsening of symptoms, local swelling and dizziness. These studies reported no life-threatening adverse effects and
found that acupuncture treatments were cost-effective.
Since the time of our previous review, the quality of RCTs has improved, and we have assessed many of them as having low risk of bias.
However, few large trials have provided high-quality evidence.
Authors’ conclusions
Moderate-qualityevidence suggeststhatacupuncture relievespain betterthansham acupuncture, asmeasuredatcompletionof treatment
and at short-term follow-up, and that those who received acupuncture report less pain and disability at short-term follow-up than those
on a wait-list. Moderate-quality evidence also indicates that acupuncture is more effective than inactive treatment for relieving pain at
short-term follow-up.

Acupuncture for neck disorders
Review question
We reviewed the evidence on effects of acupuncture on function, disability, patient satisfaction and global perceived effect among
individuals with neck pain.
Background
Neck pain is one of the three most frequently reported complaints of the musculoskeletal system. Treatments for neck pain are varied,
as are perceptions of benefit. Acupuncture is sometimes used as an alternative to more conventional treatment for musculoskeletal pain.
In this review, acupuncture was defined as stimulation of one or more specific points on the body by insertion of needles to achieve
a therapeutic effect. Acupuncture typically includes manual stimulation of needles, but variations are common, such as electrical or
heat stimulation of the needles, which is called moxibustion (moxa herb, Artemisia vulgaris, is burned at the handle end of the needle).
Injection acupuncture, in which herbal extracts are injected into acupuncture points, is occasionally used as well.
Study characteristics
We included in this review 27 trials (5462 participants) that examined effects of acupuncture for acute to chronic neck pain (lasting a
few days to at least three months). Acupuncture was compared with sham acupuncture, wait-list or inactive treatment (e.g. sham laser).
The evidence is current to August 2015.
Key results
Researchers described variability in populations studied, acupuncture techniques used and outcomes measured, so we could not combine
the results of these trials to get an overall picture of the effectiveness of acupuncture. Therefore, we could draw only limited conclusions.

Acupuncture for neck disorders (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Individuals with chronic neck pain who received acupuncture reported better pain relief immediately after treatment and in the short
term compared to those who received sham treatments. Individuals with chronic neck pain who received acupuncture reported better
pain relief and improvement in disability in the short term than those who were on a wait-list.
Acupuncture treatments appear to be safe, and investigators have reported only minor and short-lasting side effects.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence used to determine whether acupuncture is helpful remains low or moderate. Limitations in the evidence
include few study participants, the tendency of researchers to not keep track of who dropped out of the study and they did not make
sure that patients who entered the study were randomly assigned to a group. These types of flaws introduce bias into the studies and
therefore affect how strongly we believe the results.

Description of the condition
Neck pain is a common health impairment among individu-
als of all ages in the general population (Cote 2004; Haldeman
2008; Hogg-Johnson 2008; Miller 2010). In fact, according to
Haldeman 2008, “most people can expect to experience some de-
gree of neck pain in their lifetime”. The prevalence of neck pain in
adults over a 12-month period ranges from 30% to 50% (Carroll
2008; Hogg-Johnson 2008). Furthermore, neck pain is a com-
monly recurring condition. Neck pain appears to be episodic in
nature and therefore frequently recurs in 50% to 80% of peo-
ple one to five years after a prior incident (Carroll 2008; Cote
2004). Symptoms of neck pain range from mildly discomforting
to severely disabling and can interfere with daily activities and
quality of life. Moreover, incidents of neck pain can be associated
with headache, arm pain or even neurological or sensory deficits
(Haldeman 2008). Neck pain has a substantial impact on health-
care costs; the economic burden of neck pain is widespread because
it affects patients, insurers, governments and employers through
sick leave, disability, visits to healthcare providers and loss of pro-
ductivity (Haldeman 2008; Haraldsson 2006; Miller 2010).
Description of the intervention
A variety of conventional treatments are used to address neck pain,
including massage, physiotherapy, exercise, muscle relaxants and
steroid injections (Fu 2009SR; Haraldsson 2006; Irnich 2001).
Acupuncture has been used increasingly as an alternative to more
conventional treatment for musculoskeletal pain. It is defined as
stimulation of a certain point or points on the body by insertion
of needles to achieve a therapeutic effect. Acupuncture typically
includes manual stimulation of needles, but variations are com-
monly used, such as electrical and heat stimulation of needles,
which is called moxibustion (the moxa herb Artemisia vulgaris is
burned at the handle end of the needle).
How the intervention might work
Research evidence indicates that acupuncture involves the release
of neurotransmitters and hormones such as endorphins (Han
2004), serotonin (Zhang 2012) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
(Goldman 2010).
Best evidence suggests that the release of β-endorphin triggered
by acupuncture acts both as a neurotransmitter involved in central
descending pain inhibitory pathways and as a hormone released
into the blood flow. In addition, evidence indicates that central
release of dynorphines and the expression level of the opioid an-
tagonist cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) (Tang 1997) may
play a role in central mechanisms of acupuncture-induced anal-
gesia. In the peripheral nervous system, β-endorphin seems to be
released from keratinocytes when activated by increased extracel-
lular endocannabinoid concentrations after acupuncture in an in-
flammatory pain model (Chen 2009).
Likewise, serotonin is known to be involved in the analgesic effect
of acupuncture by affecting transmission of pain signals at central
and peripheral levels. Similar to oestrogen, serotonin seems to be
indirectly involved in the antinociceptive effect of acupuncture by
sensitising peripheral afferents and thereby activating endogenous
pain control. In contrast, an increase in extracellular ATP concen-
tration may act directly on afferent neurons expressing purinergic
receptors, leading to nerve fibre activation, which in turn causes
antinociceptive spinal or supraspinal reactions.
Such mechanisms of endogenous pain control triggered by Aδ-
and C-fiber activation are generally distinguished according to the
respective neural structures and neurotransmitters involved and
are termed diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC), segmental
inhibition and descending pain control pathways (Zhao 2008).
Effects of acupuncture on muscles and fascia have also been de-
scribed (Langevin 2006). When effects of acupuncture are ap-
proached from the perspective of mechanical tissue manipula-
tion, it can be concluded that existing evidence shows effects of
acupuncture on structure and alignment of connective tissue or
fasciae (Langevin 2006). Conversely, a reduction in muscle tone
through acupuncture has been proposed, but this proposal is based
mainly on observations of clinical improvement after acupunc-
ture, such as increased cervical range of motion in patients with
neck pain (Irnich 2001). Moreover, recent brain imaging studies
have revealed that acupuncture alters brain activation patterns in
areas associated with pain processing (Huang 2012SR).
Why it is important to do this review
According to several existing reviews, including our own (Trinh
2006), moderate-quality evidence indicates that acupuncture is
effective in the short term for relieving neck pain (Fu 2009; Furlan
2012; Graham 2013; Gross 2007; Vernon 2009). Randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) included in these reviews were based on
small population samples (Irnich 2011; Linde 2007), and more
recent studies are likely to have used improved methods.
Given the heavy public health and economic burden caused by
neck pain and the fact that many sufferers consult complemen-
tary and alternative medicine practitioners for relief of their symp-
toms, a systematic review with new and updated evidence of these
practices was justified. The purpose of this review was to include
more recent studies in an effort to reveal updated evidence for the
use of acupuncture to relieve neck pain and to examine long-term
effects that were absent from previous studies. This review sum-
marises the most current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of
acupuncture for acute, subacute and chronic neck pain.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in full
text or abstract form. We included abstracts if sufficient informa-
tion for analyses could be obtained from study authors. We ex-
cluded quasi-RCTs and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) because
we found numerous RCTs for this update. This is different from
the approach presented in the protocol.
Types of participants
Participants were adults (18 years or older) with the following neck
disorders.
• Mechanical neck disorders (MNDs), including whiplash-
associated disorders (WADs) categories 1 and 2 (Spitzer 1987;
Spitzer 1995), myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) and
degenerative changes (DCs) (Schumacher 1993).
• Neck disorder with headache (Olesen 1988; Olesen 1997;
Sjaastad 1990).
• Neck disorders with radicular symptoms (NDRs),
including WAD category 3 (Spitzer 1987; Spitzer 1995).
For the purposes of this review, we defined symptom duration as
acute (< 30 days), subacute (30 days to 90 days) or chronic (≥ 90
days).
We excluded studies if they investigated neck disorders with:
• definite or possible long tract signs (e.g. myelopathies);
• neck pain caused by other pathological entities
(Schumacher 1993);
• neck pain related to neurological disease (e.g. spasmodic
torticollis);
• neck pain related to fracture and dislocation;
• headache not of cervical origin;
• co-existing headache when neck pain was not dominant or
when headache was not provoked by neck movement or
sustained neck posture; or
• ’mixed’ headache.
Types of interventions
Studies must have used acupuncture techniques involving inser-
tion of needles. Stimulation of needles may involve manual, elec-
trical, heat, laser or other forms of stimulation. Control groups
were treated with sham acupuncture (some form of mock or pre-
tend), wait-list control or inactive treatment control (e.g. sham
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)).
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
Pain relief (e.g. visual analogue scale (VAS), numerical rating scale
(NRS)), disability or functional measures (e.g. Neck Disability
Index (NDI), quality of life (e.g. Short Form (SF)-36), activities of
daily living (ADLs)), patient satisfaction questionnaires and global
perceived effect were the outcomes of interest.
Secondary outcomes
When available, we examined adverse effects and costs of treat-
ment.
The duration of the follow-up period was defined as:
• immediately post treatment: up to one day;
• short-term follow-up: between one day and three months;
• intermediate-term follow-up: longer than three months to
less than one year; or
• long-term follow-up: one year and longer.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the following databases from their inception to Au-
gust 2015.
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL, which includes the Cochrane Back Review Group
(CBRG) Trials Register; Ovid, August 2015).
• MEDLINE (Ovid, 1950 to August 2015 week 4).
• EMBASE (Ovid, 1980 to August 2015).
• Manual, Alternative and Natural Therapy Indexing System
(MANTIS; Ovid, 1980 to November 2013 last available access
date).
• Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
(CINAHL; EBSCO, 1982 to August 2015).
• Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL; August 2015).
• ClinicalTrials.gov (August 2015).
• World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (August 2015).
The Chinese Cochrane Centre searched the Traditional Chinese
Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS) in

 China in September 2005. We did not further update the TCM-
LARS search, as this search yielded no RCTs previously.
See Appendix 1 for the search strategies used for CENTRAL,
MEDLINE, EMBASE, MANTIS, CINAHL and ICL. Subject
headings (MeSHs) and keywords included anatomical terms, dis-
order or syndrome terms, treatment terms and methodological
terms consistent with those advised by the CBRG (Furlan 2009).
Searching other resources
We also screened references, communicated with the Trials Search
Co-ordinator of the CBRG, contacted identified content experts
and reviewed our own personal files.
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The
Cochrane Collaboration and the CBRG.
Selection of studies
At least two review authors independently identified citations,
selected studies and abstracted data. We resolved disagreements
through consensus.
If additional information was required to assess the appropriate-
ness of a study for selection, we contacted study authors for clari-
fication. If this was not forthcoming, we allowed a consensus pro-
cess to determine selection status. If the article or citation post-
ing was written in a non-English language, one investigator and
a translator with a health sciences background conducted study
selection in an unblinded manner.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors independently extracted raw data for demo-
graphics, descriptions of treatment and all outcomes from full
manuscripts onto pre-designed forms.
Using the Chi2 test, we calculated agreement between investiga-
tors for study identification, selection and validity processes be-
fore reaching consensus (Graham 2012). We used the quadratic
weighted kappa statistic (Kw) (Cicchetti 1976) to measure agree-
ment.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
At least two review authors independently assessed each selected
study for methodological quality using pre-piloted forms based on
the CBRG risk of bias (RoB) assessment tool (12 criteria) (Furlan
2009). See Appendix 2 for operationalisation of the RoB tool. We
rated each item as having high, low or unclear risk and entered
ratings into the RoB table. A consensus team met to reach a fi-
nal assessment based on an overview of RoB items; we used no
pre-defined cutoff score for the RoB assessment. We deemed an
RCT acceptable for inclusion if we found no fatal methodological
flaws (e.g. randomisation, allocation concealment, drop-outs, in-
tention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were done appropriately and were
well reported).
Measures of treatment effect
We used descriptive statistics to provide a summary description of
groups, interventions, outcomes, adverse effects of treatment and
costs of care. We reported results on the basis of the sample size
analysed.
We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs) for outcomes reported in a contin-
uous data format. We used the SMD because different measures
were frequently used to address the same clinical outcome. Effect
size (SMD) is a unitless measure reported in standard deviation
units. Generally, effect size can be interpreted as small (-0.20),
medium (-0.50) or large (-0.80), as defined by Cohen (Cohen
1988).
For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and
95% CIs for outcome rates in the treatment versus control group.
For undesirable outcomes, RR less than one represents a beneficial
treatment.
When neither continuous nor dichotomous data were available,
we extracted findings and statistical significance as reported by
authors of the original study and noted them in the Characteristics
of included studies tables.
Unit of analysis issues
For clinical trials using a simple parallel-group design, we collected
from each participant and analysed a single measurement for each
outcome. For clinical trials using a cross-over design, we collected
fromeach participantandanalysedmeasurementsof each outcome
for each participant from each of the interventions. We analysed
only the first phase of the cross-over study and included no cluster-
randomised trials in this review.
Dealing with missing data
Whendatawere notextractable, we contactedthe primaryauthors.
Whenneithercontinuousnordichotomousdatawere available,we
extracted findings and presented statistical significance as reported
by study authors.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We considered the following possible sources of heterogeneity:
symptom duration (acute vs chronic); subtype of neck pain (e.g.
WAD); intervention type (traditional acupuncture vs trigger point
needling); characteristics of treatment (e.g. dosage, technique);
and outcomes (pain relief, measures of function and disability,
patient satisfaction, quality of life).
8
Acupuncture for neck disorders (Review)

 A P value for the Chi2 test (test of heterogeneity) less than 0.05 or
an I2 value greater than 25% would indicate significant statistical
heterogeneity. However, because an acupuncture review includes
few studies, the test of heterogeneity might not have the power to
detect a difference even when one exists; therefore, we determined
that subgroups were statistically heterogeneous if I2 values were
greater than 25% despite failure to reject the null hypothesis with
the Chi2 test.
Assessment of reporting biases
When a published protocol was available, we compared outcomes
reported a priori with outcomes of interest in the RCT.
Data synthesis
Before calculating a pooled effect measure, we assessed the appro-
priateness of pooling on clinical grounds. We planned to combine
outcome measures from individual trials by performing a meta-
analysis when possible (clinical comparability of populations, in-
terventions and outcomes between trials). We planned to use a
random-effects model for these meta-analyses.
We considered each subgroup (e.g. 1.1) to be clinically homoge-
neous. We meta-analysed each subgroup unless we noted statisti-
cal heterogeneity. When a meta-analysis was not possible, we de-
scribed qualitatively in the text the results of clinically comparable
trials.
Regardless of whether available data were sufficient for use in
quantitative analyses to summarise the data, we assessed the over-
all quality of the evidence for each outcome. To accomplish this,
we used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment,
Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach, as rec-
ommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions (Higgins 2011) and adapted in the updated CBRG
method guidelines (Furlan 2009). We considered that the follow-
ing factors may decrease the quality of the evidence, study design
and risk of bias, inconsistency of results, indirectness (not general-
isable), imprecision (sparse data) and other factors (e.g. reporting
bias). We reduced our rating of the quality of the evidence for
a specific outcome by one level according to the performance of
studies against these five factors.
• High-quality evidence: Findings are consistent among at
least 75% of RCTs with low risk of bias; consistent, direct and
precise data; and no known or suspected publication bias.
Further research is unlikely to change the estimate or our
confidence in the results.
• Moderate-quality evidence: One of the domains is not
met. Further research is likely to have an important impact on
our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the
estimate.
• Low-quality evidence: Two domains are not met. Further
research is very likely to have an important impact on our
confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the
estimate.
• Very low-quality evidence: Three domains are not met.
We are very uncertain about the results.
• No evidence: We identified no RCTs that addressed this
outcome.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We did not plan to perform a subgroup analysis.
Sensitivity analysis
We planned to conduct a sensitivity analysis on risks of bias or
meta-regression by type of neck pain and duration of symptoms.
However, we did not find sufficient data for any of these categories.

Results of the search
We identified and screened 1562 citation postings and retrieved
154 studies for more detailed evaluation. We included 27 RCTs
in this review (Figure 1). We identified no RCTs through the
Chinese language search. Additionally, five studies were proto-
cols (Calamita 2015; Kim 2014; Liang 2012; Que 2013; Sun
2014) and two were conference proceeding abstracts (Amos 2012;
Liguori 2012) that are awaiting assessment. One study is awaiting
translation (Simma-Kletscha 2009), and four further studies are
awaiting completion (Bar-Haim 2012; Cerezo-Tellez 2014; Choi
2011; Guo 2014). We found three studies that provided additional
analyses for the primary study (see Witt 2006). We found four
studies after analysis was complete; these are also awaiting assess-
ment (Mejuto-Vázquez 2014; Sterling 2015; Wilke 2014; Zhang
SP 2013).
See Characteristics of included studies tables for additional details

lected, co-interventions provided, absolute benefits noted, results

Agreement between pairs of independent review authors from di-
verse professional backgrounds regarding inclusion of studies was
excellent, with an estimated Kw = 0.9425 (standard error 0.020).
Included studies
Of the 27 included studies, three represented individuals with
WAD (205 participants), five chronic myofascial neck pain (186
participants), five chronic pain due to arthritic changes (n = 506),
six chronic non-specific neck pain (4011 participants), two neck
pain with radicular signs (43 participants) and six subacute or
chronic mechanical neck pain (511 participants).
Excluded studies
We excluded 103 trials after reviewing the full report. Of these, we
excluded 13 studies on the basis of participant characteristics: Two
RCTs included participants with a neck disorder excluded from
this review (i.e. ankylosing spondylitis) (Emery 1986) and spinal
cord stenosis (Li 2006); three included headaches not of cervical
origin (Coeytaux 2005; Venancio 2008; Venancio 2009); seven in-
cluded participants with pain from other areas as well (head, shoul-
der or back) (Gallacchi 1981; Gallacchi 1983; Gaw 1975; Giles
2003; Kisiel 1996; Lundeburg 1988; Muller 2005); and one in-
cluded participants who did not have neck pain (Sato 2014). Fur-
thermore, we excluded two abstracts (Johnson 2000; Teng 1973)
because they did not appear to describe RCTs. We excluded 64
studies on the basis of the comparison performed: Six studies in-
cluded acupuncture as the control (Fernandez-Carnero 2014; Guo
2013; Harvey 2015; Li 2013; Wang G 2014; Zhang J 2013); 31
compared acupuncture types (Ceccherelli 2006; Ceccherilli 2014;

pared acupuncture versus active treatment (Bahadir 2009; Cho
2014; David 1998; Edwards 2003; Eroglu 2013; Falkenberg 2007;

Yang 2013; Yoshimizu 2012; Zhang 2003; Zhang J 2008; Zhou
2014; Ziaeifar 2014). In addition, we excluded 15 RCTs on the
basis of the intervention provided: eight by type (i.e. EMG needle,
mini-scalpel, injection needle) (Calvo-Trujillo 2013; Chu 1997;
Lin 2004; Ma 2010; Seo2014; Zhang X-Z2013; Zheng2014;Zhi
2008) and seven additional studies that used acupuncture as part
of a multi-modal approach (Cohen 2014; Gallego Sendarrubias
2015; Guanygue 2001; Hayek 2014; Hudson 2010; Lundeburg
1991; Soderlund 2001) and could not isolate the acupuncture ef-
fect. We excluded eight studies because they were not randomised
or were quasi-randomised (Ga 2007a; Hua 2009; Loy 1983; Luo
2010; Pan 2008; Peng 1987; Xue 2007; Zhang 1996). We ex-
cluded one study because investigators did not perform between-
group comparisons (Zhu 2002). (See Characteristics of excluded
studies tables.)

 Risk of bias in included studies
We assessed methodological quality using CBRG guidelines
(Furlan 2009). Please see Figure 2 for these results. We assessed 12
of the 27 included studies (44%) as having fatal flaws, including
selection, performance, attrition (related to lack of ITT princi-
ples) and reporting biases. Otherpotential sources of bias included
inadequate reporting of co-interventions and participant compli-

 Allocation
We found that six of the 27 included studies had low risk of bias
on the basis of allocation; 19 had uncertain risk of bias; and two
had high risk of bias. We discussed effects of risks of bias on review
results for each subgroup separately under Effects of interventions.
Blinding
We found that 12 of the 27 included studies had low risk of bias
on blinding of participants; 12 studies had uncertain risk of bias,
and three had high risk of bias. We discussed effects of risks of
bias on review results for each subgroup separately under Effects
of interventions.
Incomplete outcome data
We found that two of the 27 included studies had low risk of bias
on drop-out rate; four studies had uncertain risk of bias, and one
had high risk of bias. We discussed effects of risks of bias on review
results for each subgroup separately under Effects of interventions.
Selective reporting
We found that three of the 27 included studies had low risk of
bias; 24 studies had uncertain risk of bias, and no study had high
risk of bias. We discussed effects of risks of bias on review results
for each subgroup separately under Effects of interventions.
Other potential sources of bias
We assessed 12 of the 27 included studies (44%) as having fatal
flaws, including selection, performance, attrition (related to lack
of ITT principles) and reporting biases. Other potential sources
of bias included inadequate reporting of co-interventions and par-
ticipant compliance.

Acupuncture versus sham acupuncture
Pain intensity (VAS) post treatment
Eleven studies (n = 712) included participants with mechanical
neck disorders or myofascial pain syndrome. Eight of these eleven
studies favoured acupuncture over sham acupuncture. One study
(Sahin 2010) did not favour acupuncture. However, this study had
a fatal methodological flaw involving randomisation issues and the
small number of participants recruited compared with the number
of participants needed for its sample size calculation. This study
was terminated early and is considered to have high risk of bias.
Itoh 2007 studied two methods of acupuncture compared with
sham acupuncture. The trigger point treatment was significantly
different from sham, and the standard acupuncture treatment was
not significantly different from sham. We considered this study to
have high risk of bias. Thomas 1991, a study with high risk of bias,
also did not favour acupuncture for individuals with osteoarthritis.
These studies involved various methods of sham acupuncture or
pretend acupuncture treatments. In some studies, sham group nee-
dles did not penetrate the skin (Chou 2009; Itoh 2007). Some
studies defined their sham treatments as superficial needle inser-
tions (Fu 2009; Sun 2010; Thomas 1991; Tsai 2010); three studies
use a sham control group for whom needles were placed at some
distance (1 to 2 cm) from the acupuncture points (He 2004; Liang
2011; Sahin 2010) or in a remote dermatome (White 2000). Birch
1998 used predetermined irrelevant points in his control group.
We considered five of these 11 studies to have low risk of bias
(Birch 1998; Chou 2009; He 2004; Liang 2011; Tsai 2010) and
six studies to have high risk of bias (Fu 2009; Itoh 2007; Sahin
2010; Sun 2010; Thomas 1991; White 2000).
Statistical pooling was inappropriate in this instance because of
statistical heterogeneity (P value = 0.00001; I2 = 83%). Moderate-
quality evidence suggests that acupuncture is beneficial for indi-
viduals with chronic mechanical neck pain for pain intensity im-
mediately following treatment. (Please see Analysis 1.1.) On the
basis of the GRADE scale, we downgraded the quality level of
evidence to moderate because only five of the 11 studies (46%)
presented low risk.
Pain intensity (VAS) short term
We assigned eight studies (n = 560) (Cameron 2011; Fu 2009;
Liang 2011; Nabeta 2002; Sahin 2010; Sun 2010; Tough 2010;
Itoh 2007) to this category. (Please see Analysis 1.2.) Statistical
pooling was appropriate in this instance because of statistical ho-
mogeneity (P value = 0.83; I2 = 0%). Results of the meta-analy-
sis favoured acupuncture (P value = 0.006). We considered four
studies (Fu 2009; Itoh 2007; Sahin 2010; Sun 2010) to have high
risk of bias. On the basis of the GRADE scale, we downgraded
the quality level to moderate because only four of the eight studies
(50%) presented low risk.
Pain intensity (VAS) intermediate term
Two studies (n = 158) presented low risk of bias: one involving
participants with whiplash (Cameron 2011) and the other involv-
ing participants with mechanical neck disorders (He 2004). Both
14

 studies favoured acupuncture. (Please see Analysis 1.3.) Statistical
pooling was inappropriate in this instance because of statistical
heterogeneity (P value = 0.06; I2 = 71%). On the basis of the
GRADE scale, we downgraded the quality level of evidence to
moderate as the result of imprecision.
Pain intensity (VAS) long term
One study (n = 24) with low risk of bias involved participants
with mechanical neck disorders (He 2004). This study favoured
acupuncture. (Please see Analysis 1.4.)
Disability and quality of life
No convincing evidence favoured acupuncture in all other mea-
sures such as disability (NDI) or quality of life over the short
term, the intermediate term or the long term. (Please see Analysis
1.5, Analysis 1.6, Analysis 1.7, Analysis 1.8, Analysis 1.9, Analysis
1.10, and Analysis 1.11.) Statistical pooling for Analysis 1.6 and
Analysis 1.8 were inappropriate in this instance because of hetero-
geneity.
Some evidence suggests that acupuncture may be more beneficial
than sham acupuncture for disability (Northwick Park Pain Ques-
tionnaire (NPQ)). Two studies (n = 290) involved participants
with mechanical neck disorders, one with low risk of bias (Liang
2011) and the other with high risk of bias (Fu 2009). Meta-anal-
ysis favoured acupuncture (P value = 0.001). (Please see Analysis
1.7.) Statistical pooling was appropriate in this instance because
of statistical homogeneity (P value = 0.88; I2 = 0%). On the basis
of the GRADE scale, we downgraded the quality level of evidence
to moderate because only one of the two studies (50%) presented
low risk.
Acupuncture versus inactive treatment
Pain intensity (VAS) immediate post treatment
We assigned five studies (n = 245) to this category (Ilbuldu 2004;
Irnich 2002; Petrie 1986; Seidel 2002; Thomas 1991). We con-
sidered two of these studies (Irnich 2002; Seidel 2002) to have
low risk of bias and three to have high risk of bias (Ilbuldu 2004;
Petrie 1986; Thomas 1991). Statistical pooling was inappropriate
in this instance because of statistical heterogeneity (P value = 0.20;
I2 = 33%). Most of these studies - four of the five - did not favour
acupuncture (Ilbuldu 2004; Petrie 1986; Seidel 2002; Thomas
1991). (Please see Analysis 2.1.)
Pain intensity (VAS) short term
Five studies (n = 404) (Irnich 2001; Petrie 1986; Seidel 2002;
Vas 2006; White 2004) assessed participants with mechanical
neck disorders. Petrie 1986 found no differences between groups
(Petrie 1986). Another study compared acupuncture versus sham
laser and reported no differences (Irnich 2001). However, Vickers
2004 used regression analysis and adjusted for baseline pain in
re-analysing this study (Vickers 2004) and showed that acupunc-
ture resulted in a 9.4-point greater reduction in pain over sham
laser (0.9 to 18.0 points; P value = 0.031). Another study com-
pared acupuncture versus sham laser (Seidel 2002) and showed
statistically significant results favouring acupuncture at four-week
follow-up. One study compared acupuncture versus sham elec-
troacupuncture stimulator and yielded positive results at one-week
follow-up, but these results were not sustained at eight-week fol-
low-up (White 2004). Vas and colleagues also favoured acupunc-
ture over inactive treatment (Vas 2006).
Statistical pooling was inappropriate in this instance because of
statistical heterogeneity (P value = 0.0001; I2 = 83%). We con-
sidered four of these studies (Irnich 2001; Seidel 2002; Vas 2006;
White 2004) to have low risk of bias and one study (Petrie 1986)
(n = 26) to have high risk of bias.
On the basis of the GRADE scale, we determined that evidence
should be rated as high quality because criteria such as design,
limitations, inconsistency of results, indirectness, imprecision and
other factors were met. However, because of the small sample
size of these studies, it is highly possible that future research may
change the estimate or our confidence in the results. Therefore,
we downgraded the quality level of evidence to moderate. Mod-
erate-quality evidence suggests that acupuncture is beneficial for
individuals with chronic mechanical neck pain for pain intensity
at short-term follow-up. (Please see Analysis 2.2.)
Pain intensity (VAS) intermediate term
Three studies (n = 318) assessed participants with mechanical neck
disorders (Vas 2006; White 2004) or myofascial pain syndrome
(Ilbuldu 2004). One of these studies favoured acupuncture over
inactive treatment (Vas 2006). We considered two of these studies
(Vas 2006; White 2004) to have low risk of bias. Statistical pool-
ing was inappropriate in this instance because of statistical hetero-
geneity (P value = 0.21; I2 = 36%).
Low-quality evidence suggests that acupuncture is beneficial for
individuals with chronic mechanical neck pain for pain intensity
at intermediate-term follow-up. We downgraded the quality of
evidence because of risk of bias (< 75% of the studies presented
low risk) and inconsistency of results. (Please see Analysis 2.3.)
Pain intensity (VAS) long term
We considered White 2004 (n = 124) to have low risk of bias; this
study did not favour acupuncture treatment. No evidence suggests
that acupuncture is effective for long-term pain relief. (Please see
Analysis 2.4.)

Acupuncture versus wait-list control
Pain intensity (VAS) at short-term follow-up
One study (n = 30) involving participants with mechanical
neck disorders with radicular symptoms (Coan 1982) favoured
acupuncture for short-term pain relief. This study had low risk of
bias. However, no evidence suggests that this improvement was
sustained to intermediate follow-up. (Please see Analysis 3.1.)
Disability and quality of life
One study (n = 3766) involving participants with mechanical neck
disorders (Witt 2006) favoured acupuncture for short-term NDI
improvement. This study had low risk of bias, but no evidence
suggests that this improvement was sustained to intermediate fol-
low-up. (Please see Analysis 3.2.)
No convincing evidence favoured acupuncture in all other mea-
sures such as quality of life over the short term or the intermediate
term regarding physical or mental scores (SF-36). In fact, some
evidence suggests that results favoured control on the basis of a
single study in each category. (Please see Analysis 3.3, Analysis 3.4,
Analysis 3.5 and Analysis 3.6.)
Fourteen studies reported adverse effects (Cameron 2011; Fu
2009; Irnich 2001; Irnich 2002; Itoh 2007; Kwak 2012; Liang
2011; Nabeta 2002; Seidel 2002; Sun 2010; Tough 2010; Vas
2006; White 2004; Witt 2006), which included increased pain,
bruising, fainting, worsening of symptoms, local swelling and
dizziness. (See Characteristics of included studies table for full de-
tails.) These studies noted no life-threatening adverse effects.
One large multi-centre trial reported costs of care (Witt 2006) and
indicated that acupuncture is cost-effective.

Acupuncture for neck disorders (Review)

 D I S C U S S I O N
Summary of main results
For mechanical neck pain, we found that acupuncture is more ben-
eficial at immediate-term follow-up compared with sham treat-
ments for pain intensity; at short-term follow-up compared with
sham treatments and inactive treatments for pain intensity; at
short term follow-up compared with sham treatments for disabil-
ity (Northwick Park Pain Questionnaire (NPQ)) and at short-
term follow-up compared with wait-list control for pain intensity
and Neck Disability Index (NDI) improvement. Effects do not
seem sustainable over the long term. Our primary studies did not
examine whether subsequent repeated sessions will be successful.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
In this review, we limited our trials to include acupuncture in-
terventions in the experimental arm and no acupuncture inter-
ventions in the control arm. Control arms could be given sham
acupuncture, an inactive treatment or no treatment. In this way,
we could better study the effects of acupuncture. Our challenge
remains determining what constitutes acupuncture treatments.
In other Cochrane reviews such as acupuncture for back pain,
acupuncture is defined as treatment that uses some type of stan-
dardised acupuncture points, whereas dry needling is treatment
that uses acupuncture needles over trigger points. We found in-
sufficient studies on dry needling alone to justify separating this
needling treatment method for examination in a separate review.
We found that the number of acupuncture treatment sessions was
associated with outcomes (Ezzo 2000). Ideally, treatment should
consist of six or more acupuncture sessions. One study (Irnich
2002) intentionally studied the effects of a single treatment. Five
studies provided underdosing with fewer than six treatment ses-
sions (Chou 2009; Ilbuldu 2004; Nabeta 2002; Tsai 2010; Vas
2006). All remaining studies were adequately dosed on the basis
of this variable alone.
Quality of the evidence
The most difficult challenge faced in this review was clinical het-
erogeneity, which appeared at many levels, as in sample group in-
cluded, acupuncture interventions provided and outcomes mea-
sured. Acupuncture interventions and sham therapies were quite
varied. Among sham therapies, treatment varied from a non-in-
sertion type of inactivated transcutaneous electrical nerve stimula-
tion (TENS) or laser to insertion of needles at different locations
or at different depths. The qualitative method of synthesising ev-
idence has its limitations. We determined consistency of evidence
by group consensus, but this method is sensitive to how studies
are categorised because meeting the criteria for a certain level of
evidence depends on the number of studies included within a cat-
egory.
Fortunately, the quality of acupuncture studies for neck pain seems
to have improved over time. We classified many studies identified
in the latest update of our search as having low risk of bias.
Potential biases in the review process
Weaknesses of this review rest with limitations in the primary
studies. Furthermore, many studies did not report details of drop-
outs. We avoided language bias by including all languages during
study selection; however, we did not search non-English language
databases, and we did not search Chinese databases beyond 2005.
Our approach to summarising the literature has several strengths.
We used a comprehensive, librarian-assisted search of multiple
databases. We relied on teams of healthcare professionals to decide
on article relevance and to assess study quality. At least two review
authors extracted data, and the principal investigator verified data
entry. We used a group consensus approach, coupled with the
Cochrane Back Review Group risk of bias assessment tool. We
avoided professional bias inherent in having members of a single
profession evaluate the literature for that profession.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Our findings are similar to those of our past review in 2006 (Trinh
2006) and to those of Fu et al in 2009 (Fu 2009). This is consistent
with other reviews on acupuncture for migraine headache prophy-
laxis (Linde 2009), elbow pain (Trinh 2004), tension headache
(Linde 2009a) and back pain (Furlan 2005). The result is not sur-
prising. The findings of our review of other therapies for neck dis-
orders were disappointing. It appears that the effect size of treat-
ments for neck disorders is small even for therapies (such as injec-
tions) believed to have a large clinical effect. It is likely that in a
clinical setting, both specific and non-specific effects of treatments
are evident, whereas in a randomised controlled trial (RCT), in-
vestigators observe non-specific effects of treatments in both ex-
perimental and control groups. Therefore, the difference is seen in
the specific effects of treatment, and these effects may be smaller
than those observed clinically.

 compared with sham treatments for pain intensity; at short-term
follow-up compared with sham treatments for disability (NPQ);
at short-term follow-up compared with inactive treatments for
pain intensity; and at short-term follow-up compared with wait-
list control for pain intensity and neck disability improvement.
Effects do not seem sustainable over the long term. Acupuncture
treatments appear to be relatively safe.
Implications for research
Acupuncture trials with adequate sample size are needed to exam-
ine the long-term efficacy or effectiveness of acupuncture com-
pared with sham acupuncture.

INDEX TREATMENT 2
Trigger point acupuncture (TrP)
Local needling of myofascial trigger points (mean number of insertions 2.3)
Needles were inserted 20 mm into the skin over the trigger point by the ’sparrow pecking’
technique. Manipulation was stopped when the local twitch response was elicited, and
the needle was left in place for an additional 10 minutes
INDEX TREATMENT 3:
Non-trigger point acupuncture (non-TrP)
Non-TrP group received the same treatment as above but at non-tender points (mean
number of insertions 2.4). The non-tender point chosen had no tenderness nor taut
muscle band. However, the point was selected in the same muscle but away from the
trigger point by 50 mm
COMPARISON TREATMENT
Sham acupuncture (SH)
SH groups received treatment at trigger points. Similar stainless steel needles were used,

Interventions
Treatment was provided to ’tender points’ on the posterior aspect of the neck and upper
back
”All tender points were carefully detected where the subjects felt dull pain and stiffness
(neck, shoulder, and back) and were used for the acupuncture treatment. All tender
points were treated in each group”
INDEX TREATMENT
’Sparrow pecking’ acupuncture
Disposable stainless needles (0.2 mm × 40 mm) were inserted into the muscle to a depth
of about 20 mm, and the ‘sparrow pecking’ technique was applied. When the participant
felt Deqi, the manipulation was stopped and the needle was retained for 5 more minutes
COMPARISON TREATMENT
Simulated ’sparrow pecking’ acupuncture with no needle insertion
For sham acupuncture, similar stainless needles (0.2 mm × 40 mm) were used, but the
tips had previously been cut off to prevent the needle from penetrating the skin. The cut
endswere smoothedwith sandpapermanuallyundercleanconditions. The acupuncturist
pretended to insert the needle and to use the sparrow pecking technique, then removed

single-use needles (25 mm × 0.25 mm or 40 mm × 0.25 mm). Puncture was effected
by determining the Deqi. Needles were kept in place for 30 minutes and were manually
stimulated every 10 minutes. After the needles were removed, Vaccaria seeds were applied
in the ear auricle and were taped there until the following treatment session. Participants
were told to apply pressure to each ear point for a series of 10 repeats 3 times per day

SMD 3.00 (95% CI random 2.90 to 3.10) at 6 month follow-up
Reasons for drop-out: 315 participants could not be included in the ITT analysis because
the study office did not receive the consent form
Adverse effects: 8.9% of cases (n = 1005); 1216 side effects were reported: 57% minor
local bleeding or hematoma, 10% pain (e.g. needling pain), 4% vegetative symptoms,

Costs of care: acupuncture treatment associated with higher costs (EURO925.53 ±
1551.06 vs EURO648.06 ± 1459.13); however according to assumed threshold values
beyond 3 month follow-up, acupuncture appears cost-effective. Also, over-the-counter
medications were not included in the cost of routine care

Appendix 2. Criteria for assessing risk of bias for internal validity
Random sequence generation (selection bias)
Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomised sequence
Risk of selection bias is low if investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as referring to a
random number table, using a computer random number generator, tossing a coin, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing
lots and minimising (minimisation may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent to being
random).

 Risk of selection bias is high if investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process such as sequence
generated by odd or even date of birth, date (or day) of admission, hospital or clinic record number; or allocation by judgement of the
clinician, preference of the participant, results of a laboratory test or series of tests, or availability of the intervention.
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations before assignment
Risk of selection bias is low if participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the
following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-
controlled randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; or sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed
envelopes.
Risk of bias is high if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection
bias, such as allocation based on using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were
used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or
rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures.
Blinding of participants
Performance bias due to knowledge of allocated interventions by participants during the study
Risk of performance bias is low if blinding of participants was ensured and it was unlikely that blinding could have been broken; or if
no blinding or incomplete blinding was provided but the review authors judged that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack
of blinding.
Blinding of personnel/care providers (performance bias)
Performance bias due to knowledge of allocated interventions by personnel/care providers during the study
Risk of performance bias is low if blinding of personnel was ensured and it was unlikely that blinding could have been broken; or if no
blinding or incomplete blinding was provided but the review authors judged that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of
blinding.
Blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias)
Detection bias due to knowledge of allocated interventions by outcome assessors
Risk of detection bias is low if blinding of the outcome assessment was ensured and it was unlikely that blinding could have been
broken; or if no blinding or incomplete blinding was provided but the review authors judged that the outcome is not likely to be
influenced by lack of blinding, or:
• for patient-reported outcomes in which the participant was the outcome assessor (e.g. pain, disability): Risk of bias for outcome
assessors is low if risk of bias for participant blinding is low (Boutron 2005);
• for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events that will be determined by the interaction between participants and
care providers (e.g. co-interventions, length of hospitalisation, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome assessor:
Risk of bias for outcome assessors is low if risk of bias for care providers is low (Boutron 2005); and
• for outcome criteria that are assessed from data from medical forms: Risk of bias is low if the treatment or adverse effects of the
treatment could not be noticed in the extracted data (Boutron 2005).

 Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
Attrition bias due to amount, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data
Risk of attrition bias is low if no outcome data were missing; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the
true outcome (for survival data, censoring is unlikely to be introducing bias); missing outcome data were balanced in numbers, with
similar reasons for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the
observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome
data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have
a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size, or missing data were imputed using appropriate methods (if drop-outs were very
large, imputation using even ’acceptable’ methods may still suggest high risk of bias) (van Tulder 2003). The percentage of withdrawals
and drop-outs should not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and should not lead to substantial
bias (these percentages are commonly used but arbitrary and are not supported by the literature) (van Tulder 2003).
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting
Risk of reporting bias is low if the study protocol is available and all of the study’s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes of
interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way, or if the study protocol is not available but it is clear that published
reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).
Risk of reporting bias is high if not all of the study’s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary outcomes
were reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified; one or more
reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected
adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review were reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered into a meta-
analysis; or the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.
Group similarity at baseline (selection bias)
Bias due to dissimilarity at baseline for the most important prognostic indicators.
Risk of bias is low if groups were similar at baseline for demographic factors, value of main outcome measure(s) and important prognostic
factors (examples in the field of back and neck pain are duration and severity of complaints, vocational status and percentage of
participants with neurological symptoms) (van Tulder 2003).
Co-interventions (performance bias)
Bias because co-interventions were different across groups
Risk of bias is low if no co-interventions were provided, or if they were similar between index and control groups (van Tulder 2003).
Compliance (performance bias)
Bias due to inappropriate compliance with interventions across groups
Risk of bias is low if compliance with the interventions was acceptable and was based on reported intensity/dosage, duration, number
and frequency for both index and control intervention(s). For single-session interventions (e.g. surgery), this item is irrelevant (van
Tulder 2003).

 Intention-to-treat analysis
Risk of bias is low if all randomised participants were reported/analysed in the group to which they were allocated by randomisation.
Timing of outcome assessments (detection bias)
Bias because important outcomes were not measured at the same time across groups
Risk of bias is low if all important outcome assessments for all intervention groups were measured at the same time (van Tulder 2003).
Other bias
Bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the table
Risk of bias is low if the study appears to be free of other sources of bias not addressed elsewhere (e.g. study funding).
Appendix 3. Questions for clinical relevance
• Are patients described in sufficient detail that you can decide whether they are comparable with those whom you see in your
practice?
• Are interventions and treatment settings described well enough that you can provide the same for your patients?
• Were all clinically relevant outcomes measured and reported?
• Is the size of the effect clinically important?
• Are likely treatment benefits worth potential harms?

D Irnich is an author of two included studies. He did not take part in data extraction.
Use of raters from diverse professional backgrounds (sports medicine physician, rheumatologist, occupational health physician, physi-
atrist, statistician, physiotherapist, manual therapist, chiropractor, massage therapist) should serve to limit any conflicts of interest that
might have been present during the review process.
