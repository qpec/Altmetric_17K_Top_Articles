Abstract
Background—Sleep duration has been implicated in the etiology of obesity but less is known 
about the association between sleep and other behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
Purpose—The aim of this study was to examine the associations among sleep duration, 
chronotype, and physical activity, screen-based sedentary behavior, tobacco use, and dietary 
intake.
Methods—Regression models were used to examine sleep duration and chronotype as the 
predictors and cardiovascular risk factors as outcomes of interest in a cross-sectional sample of 
439,933 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank project.
Results—Short sleepers were 45 % more likely to smoke tobacco than adequate sleepers (9.8 vs. 
6.9 %, respectively). Late chronotypes were more than twice as likely to smoke tobacco than 
intermediate types (14.9 vs. 7.4 %, respectively). Long sleepers reported 0.61 more hours of 
television per day than adequate sleepers. Early chronotypes reported 0.20 fewer daily hours of 
computer use per day than intermediate chronotypes. Early chronotypes had 0.25 more servings of 
fruit and 0.13 more servings of vegetables per day than late chronotypes.

 Conclusions—Short and long sleep duration and late chronotype are associated with greater 
likelihood of cardiovascular risk behaviors. Further work is needed to determine whether these 
findings are maintained in the context of objective sleep and circadian estimates, and in more 
diverse samples. The extent to which promoting adequate sleep duration and earlier sleep timing 
improves heart health should also be examined prospectively.

Introduction
Low levels of physical activity, poor dietary intake, and tobacco use are likely causal 
behaviors in 40 % of all cardiovascular deaths in the USA and UK [1, 2]. Prevention efforts 
to address these risk behaviors have made modest progress. Currently, 49 % of adults do not 
meet the recommendations for regular aerobic physical activity [3], only 20 % consume 
sufficient fruits and vegetables [4], and while smoking rates have steadily declined in the last 
30 years, approximately one-in-five adults smoke tobacco and this rate climbs to as high as 
47.5 % in General Educational Development (GED) test graduates [5]. All told, less than 
5 % of adults meet standards for ideal behaviors that support heart health as defined by the 
American Heart Association [6]. To accelerate progress toward reduced mortality from poor 
health behaviors, there is a need to identify novel behavioral targets that are central to the 
disease risk factors of physical inactivity, screen-based sedentary behavior, dietary intake, 
and tobacco use.
As a common physiologic function that has been implicated in the etiology of cardiovascular 
risk behaviors [7–11], and diseases [12], sleep may be such a target. Sleep is a complex and 
multidimensional function that encompasses independent, but related, metrics including 
duration (e.g., hours of sleep in a 24-h period) and chronotype [13]. Chronotype is a 
demonstrated preference for morning or eveningness that results from endogenous biological 
rhythms and is influenced by environmental (e.g., light) and socio-occupational (e.g., 
employment hours) factors [14–16]. Importantly, sleep duration and chronotype are 
potentially modifiable [17]. If sleep were identified as being independently associated with 
several behavioral cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., tobacco use and physical inactivity), then 
hypothetically, sleep may be a common function that could be leveraged to optimize 
response to interventions designed to address these heart health behaviors.
Before sleep can be identified as a central risk factor for poor heart health behaviors, the 
magnitude of the relationship between sleep and cardiovascular risk behaviors must be 
quantified, and a profile of at-risk sleep behaviors defined. To date, there is evidence that 
sleep duration, and to a lesser extent, chronotype, are associated with physical inactivity, diet 
intake, and tobacco use. For example, higher levels of physical activity have been positively 
associated with sleep duration in younger and middle-aged men, but showed a curvilinear 
relationship in those aged 60 years or older [18]. Higher levels of physical activity were 
observed in younger and middle-aged women who achieved at least 8 hours of sleep per day 
[18]. Low levels of physical activity have been associated with sleep disorders [19]. In terms

 of sleep chronotype, a small number of studies have shown later bedtime, waketime, and 
midpoint of sleep to be associated with lower levels of physical activity [20]. Early 
chronotypes perform activities better during the morning hours [21] while late chronotypes 
may have poorer recovery from morning exercise [22].
With regard to dietary intake, both short and long sleep are predictive of poorer dietary 
intake [23, 24]. Chronotype has been shown to influence dietary intake such that late 
chronotypes consume more calories in the evening [25], eat fewer fruits and vegetables and 
more saturated fats [25–28] than early chronotypes. This is important because later meal 
timing has been associated with weight gain [29] as well as resistance to weight loss 
interventions [30].
Increasing sleep duration may improve eating habits while shifting caloric intake towards the 
morning or limiting intake after 8 pm [25]. In addition, some data show sleep duration and 
chronotype are associated with tobacco use. Short sleep is associated with current or former 
smoking status [31, 32] while both short and long sleep are associated with higher cigarette 
consumption [31, 33]. Tobacco use is more prevalent among late chronotypes in adults [34–
36] and adolescents [37, 38]. Smokers have also been shown to have delayed sleep onset as 
compared to non-smokers, [39] which can promote late chronotype.
Together, these lines of evidence provide a basis to hypothesize that sleep may be central to 
multiple cardiovascular risk behaviors. To advance this work, population studies are needed 
to indicate the magnitude of association between different sleep metrics (i..e, duration and 
chronotype) with a range of leading behavioral risk factors (i.e., physical activity, screen-
based sedentary behavior, dietary intake, and tobacco use), to determine if there is a 
common phenotype of behavioral cardiovascular risk across a range of risk behaviors (i.e., 
short sleepers and late chronotypes associated with poor levels in all risk behaviors). To this 
end, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the main association between sleep duration 
(short, adequate, and long) and chronotype (early, intermediate, late) with physical activity, 
screen-based sedentary behavior (television viewing, computer use), dietary intake (daily 
fruit and vegetable intake), and current smoking, in a population sample of 439,933 adults. 
Consistent with the smaller, single-outcome studies conducted in this area to date [25, 36, 
40], we hypothesize that short sleep and late chronotype will be associated with poor 
cardiovascular health behaviors. A positive signal from this descriptive study would propel 
this area of work by identifying a sleep phenotype for cardiovascular behavioral risk.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
To examine the relationship between sleep duration and chronotype with physical activity, 
sedentary behavior, dietary intake, and tobacco use, population data from the United 
Kingdom (UK) Biobank (application # 3474) were analyzed. The UK Biobank is a 
prospective cohort study that began in 2005. Using patient registers from the UK National 
Health Service (NHS), adults aged 40–69 years who live within a 10-mile radius of one of 
the UK Biobank's 35 assessment centers are invited to participate. At a baseline visit, 
participants provided written informed consent and completed a touch screen questionnaire

 that assessed sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health behavior variables. Between 2006 and 
2010, 502,656 eligible and consenting adults provided baseline data and these data were 
used in the current analysis. More expansive details about the rationale, design, and survey 
methods for UK Biobank have been described elsewhere [41, 42] and information on data 
availability and access procedures are given on the study website [43].
Measures
Independent Variables: Sleep Duration and Chronotype
Sleep Duration: Sleep duration was assessed with the survey item “About how many hours 
sleep do you get in every 24 h? (Please include naps.)” Responses were coded in integers 
and categorized into the following categories for analysis: very short (≤4 h), short (5–6 h), 
adequate (7–8 h), and long (≥9 h) based on previous data linking sleep duration to 
cardiometabolic disease risk in a US population sample [44].
Chronotype: Chronotype assessed using the question “Do you consider yourself to be…?” 
(definitely a morning person, more a morning than an evening person, more an evening than 
a morning person, definitely an evening person) [45]. For analysis, chronotype was 
categorized as early (“definitely morning person”), intermediate-early (“more a morning 
than an evening person”), intermediate-late (“more an evening than a morning person”), and 
late (“definitely evening”). Self-reported chronotype has been validated with self-reported 
sleep-wake times [46].
Dependent Variables: Health Behaviors
Physical Activity: Participants estimated how many days in a typical week they engaged in 
walking, moderate, and vigorous activity for ten or more minutes [47]. Minutes per week 
spent in each activity (walking, moderate, vigorous) were calculated and used in the 
analysis.
Screen-Based Sedentary Behavior: Participants estimated how many hours per day they 
spend using a computer and watching TV on a typical day [47].
Diet Variables: Fruit Consumption: To evaluate fruit intake, participants were asked to 
consider their dietary intake in the last year and to answer: “About how many pieces of 
FRESH fruit would you eat per DAY?” Each piece of fruit counted as one portion and 
median daily fruit intake was calculated and used in the current analysis.
Vegetable Consumption: To evaluate vegetable intake, participants were asked to consider 
their dietary intake in the last year and to answer: “On average how many heaped 
tablespoons of COOKED vegetables would you eat per DAY?” “On average how many 
heaped tablespoons of SALAD or RAW vegetables would you eat per DAY?” Based on the 
UK guidelines [48] that a portion of vegetables is three heaped tablespoons, median 
vegetable consumption on the average day was calculated and used in the current analysis.
Tobacco Use: Self-reported current smoking status was evaluated using a single item: 
“About how many cigarettes did you smoke on average each day?” Participants who

 reported smoking any cigarettes (including less than one per day) were categorized as being 
smokers while the remainder of the sample were considered non-smokers.
Control Variables: Sociodemographic characteristics—Sociodemographic 
variables included in the analysis were age, sex (male/female), ethnicity (coded as White, 
Asian/ Asian British/Chinese, Black/Black British, and mixed/other), attended college 
(coded as yes/no), and employment (coded as employed, not-employed, or retired).
Analysis
Cross-sectional data from 501,766 participants were obtained. Participants with responses 
coded “don't know”, “prefer not to answer”, or missing data for sleep duration or chronotype 
were excluded leaving 439,933 participants in the final sample. Participants included in the 
final analysis were significantly more likely to be female, white, college attendees, and 
employed; thus, all multivariate analyses were adjusted for these variables.
To examine variation in sleep duration and chronotype with health behavior variables, 
descriptive statistics and regression models were estimated. For the descriptive analysis, 
prevalence of very short (<4 h), short (5-6 h), adequate (7-8 h) and long (nine or more hours) 
sleep [44] and chronotype (early, intermediate-early, intermediate-late, and late) were 
computed for all sociodemographic and health behavior characteristics. Normally distributed 
continuous variables were described using means and standard deviations, while non-
normally distributed variables were described using medians and interquartile ranges. 
Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages.
To quantify the association between sleep duration and chronotype with health behavior 
outcomes, a regression model for each health behavior that included both sleep variables 
(duration and chronotype) and adjusted for sex, race, college attendance, and employment 
was generated. A three level sleep duration variable was used that collapsed the very short 
and short sleep categories allowing differences in short versus adequate sleep and long 
versus adequate sleep for each of the health behaviors to be described. A three level 
chronotype variable that collapsed more intermediate-early and intermediate-late into an 
“intermediate” category was used to examine differences in early versus intermediate 
chronotype, late versus intermediate chronotype, and early versus late chronotype for each 
of the health behaviors. General linear and binary logistic regression models were generated 
for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. Parameter estimates, along with 
their standard errors and 95 % confidence intervals, are provided for measures of effect in 
general linear models, while odds ratios are provided for logistic regression models. 
Statistical significance is taken at the 0.05 level. All statistical analyses were accomplished 
using SAS V9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

 mass index of 27.4 kg/m2 (SD=4.8). In terms of sleep duration, 68 % of the sample reported 
7–8 h for sleep in a 24-h period (adequate sleep), 1 % reported getting four or fewer hours 
(very short sleep), 24.5 % reported 5–6 h (short sleep), and 8 % reported nine or more hours 
of sleep (long sleep). Twenty-seven percent of the sample were early chronotype, 36 % 
intermediate-early chronotype, 28 % were intermediate-late chronotype, and 9 % were late 
chronotype.
Participants reported engaging in a mean of 328.5 min (SD =377.0 min) or 6.3 h of walking 
activity each week. Mean minutes of moderate activity per week was 286.4 min (SD=369.4 
min) or 4.8 h, and mean vigorous activity per week was 140.7 min (SD=188.7 min) or 2.3 h. 
Screen time was reported for a median of 1 (computer; IQR=1) to 3 (television; IQR=2) 
hours per day. Median daily servings of fruit was 2.0 (IQR=2) and vegetables was 1.3 
(IQR=1.0). Eight percent of the sample reported current smoking (Table 1).
Association Between Sleep and Physical Activity
Physical activity levels varied by sleep duration. Short sleepers accrued more mean minutes 
of walking, moderate, and vigorous activity than adequate sleepers (Table 1). Across the 
different chronotype categories, early chronotypes reported accruing more mean minutes of 
walking, moderate, and vigorous activity than intermediate or late chronotypes (Table 2).
Linear regression models of walking, moderate, and vigorous physical activity that adjusted 
for age, sex, ethnicity, employment, and college attendance showed that overall, short 
sleepers reported more minutes of physical activity per week than adequate sleepers. Long 
sleepers reported more minutes of moderate and vigorous activity than did adequate 
sleepers, although the differences, while statistically significant, were trivial (Table 3). The 
largest point estimate was noted for vigorous activity whereby short sleepers accrued on 
average, 0.10 more minutes per week of vigorous activity a week than adequate sleepers.
Multivariate examination of the association between chronotype and physical activity (Table 
3) showed that early chronotype was associated with more physical activity. The largest 
effect size for this was seen with vigorous activity: on average, early chronotypes accrued 
0.13 more minutes of vigorous activity per week than intermediate types (independent of 
sleep duration). Similarly, early chronotypes accrued, on average, 0.18 more minutes per 
week of walking and 0.17 more minutes of moderate activity, and 0.17 more minutes of 
vigorous activity per week than late chronotypes (Table 4).
Association Between Screen-Based Sedentary Behavior and Sleep
Little variation was found in screen-based sedentary behaviors (computer use and television 
viewing) across the sleep duration categories. Median computer use was 1 h/day and median 
television use was 3 h/day for short, adequate, and long sleepers. Examination of variation in 
screen-based sedentary behavior by chronotype category showed that early chronotypes had 
lower median hours of computer use per day (0.5) than intermediate or late chronotypes 
(median=1.0). All chronotype groups reported a median of 3.0 h of television viewing per 
day (Table 2).

 In the multivariate analysis of the association between sedentary behavior and sleep, data 
showed that television viewing varied considerably across sleep duration categories: on 
average, short sleepers reported 0.20 more hours of television viewing per day than adequate 
sleepers while long sleepers reported on average 0.61 more hours of television per day than 
adequate sleepers. Late chronotypes reported more screen-based sedentary behavior than 
early chronotypes. For example, early chronotypes had 0.31 fewer hours of computer use 
and 0.14 fewer hours of television viewing per day than late chronotypes (Table 4).
Association Between Dietary Intake, Body Mass Index, and Sleep
Little variation in fruit and vegetable consumption across the sleep duration and chronotype 
categories was seen. Specifically, median fruit consumption was 2.0 (IQR=2.0), and median 
vegetable consumption was 1.3 (IQR=1.0) across all sleep duration categories (Table 1). 
Fruit intake did not vary across chronotype categories (Median=2.0, IQR=2.0) while early 
chronotypes reported a slightly higher median daily vegetable intake of 1.5 servings per day 
as compared to 1.3 median servings reported by intermediate and late groups (Table 2).
The multivariate associations between sleep duration and chronotype with the dietary intake 
variables of fruit and vegetable consumption did not follow a consistent pattern (Tables 3 
and 4). Longer sleep duration was negatively associated with daily fruit intake, but positively 
associated with vegetable intake (Table 3). Short sleepers consumed, on average, 0.02 more 
servings of fruit per day than adequate sleepers. In terms of variation in fruit and vegetable 
consumption across chronotype, early chronotypes consumed, on average, 0.14 more 
servings of fruit and 0.11 more servings of vegetables, per day than intermediate 
chronotypes. Late chronotypes consumed, on average, 0.10 fewer daily servings of fruit and 
0.02 fewer daily servings of vegetables than intermediate chronotypes.
Tobacco Use and Sleep
Considerable variation in tobacco use across the sleep duration and chronotype categories 
was seen. Specifically, 9.8 % of short sleepers, 6.9 % of adequate sleepers, and 9.4 % of 
long sleepers reported current smoking (Table 1). The percentage of respondents who 
smoked cigarettes progressively increased across the early/late chronotype range: 6.4 % of 
early chronotypes and 14.9 % of late chronotypes reported current smoking (Table 2).
Logistic regression models of current smoking show that individuals with short and long 
sleep duration (versus adequate) and late chronotypes (versus intermediate) had an increased 
odds of being current smokers (Tables 3 and 4). As compared to adequate sleepers, short 
sleepers had a 45 % increased odds of being smokers (OR =1.450, SE= 0.018) while 
compared to adequate sleepers, long sleepers had a 36 % greater odds of being smokers (OR 
= 1.359, SE = 0.027) (Table 3). When chronotype was considered, early chronotype had a 
17 % reduced odds of being a current smoker as compared to intermediate types (OR = 
0.833, SE=0.012) while late chronotype had a more than twofold increased odds of being a 
smoker than intermediate types (OR=2.126, SE=0.034) (Table 4), independent of sleep 
duration. Late chronotypes had a 60 % increased odds of being a smoker than morning types 
(OR=0.407, SE=0.11) (Table 4).

 Discussion
The purpose of this population analysis was to explore the association between sleep 
duration, chronotype, and the behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease (physical 
activity, dietary intake, tobacco use) in a large population sample. Consistent with the study 
hypothesis, these population-level data clearly suggest that short and long sleepers and late 
chronotypes are groups at increased risk for poor cardiovascular health behaviors. Notably, 
short (versus adequate) sleepers had a 45 % increased odds of being current smokers and 
late (versus early) chronotypes had a 60 % increased odds of being a smoker. Long sleepers 
accrued 0.61 more hours of television per day than adequate sleepers. Early chronotypes on 
average had 0.31 fewer daily hours of computer use and 0.14 fewer hours of television and 
0.25 more servings of fruit and 0.13 more servings of vegetables than late chronotypes. 
These data converge with previous work demonstrating that adequate sleep is associated 
with beneficial heart health behaviors and extend what is known by suggesting that sleep 
timing, in particular, late chronotype patterns are associated with poor heart health 
behaviors.
Our findings that the odds of current smoking was lower in adequate sleepers and higher in 
short and long sleepers both support and extend previous work. As a stimulant, nicotine use 
has been widely associated with short sleep duration [32, 49], extended sleep latency [39], 
increased perceptions of insufficient sleep [50], and increased risk for insomnia [51]. Night-
time smoking, a frequent cause of disrupted and shortened sleep, occurs in approximately 
41 % of smokers [52]. These findings directly converge with our data showing that short 
sleepers had a 45 % increased odds of being smokers (versus adequate sleepers). Not 
previously shown is our finding that long sleepers had a 36 % increased odds of current 
smoking as compared to adequate sleepers. One possible reason for this association is the 
co-occurrence of depression with long sleep. Clinical and sub-clinical depression occur in up 
to 50 % of current smokers [53, 54] while extended sleep periods, daytime sleepiness, and 
fragmented night-time sleep are all characteristic of individuals with depression [55]. 
Smokers with elevated depressive symptoms may be apt to sleeping for longer periods 
and/or experience more daytime sleeping.
Our result that late chronotype had a 60 % increased odds of being a current smoker as 
compared to early chronotypes is congruent with the few previous studies to have examined 
this relationship in adults [34, 36, 56]. The association between late chronotype and current 
smoking could be at least partially explained by evidence showing that several affective and 
emotional traits are common to both smokers and late chronotypes. For example, sensation 
seeking, impulsivity attention deficit, anger, and negative mood have been reported as more 
common in late versus early chronotypes [57–59] and in smokers versus non-smokers [60, 
61]. Nicotine administration has been shown to ameliorate these negative affective states 
[62, 63]; thus, it could be argued that affect and mood regulation is promoted by continued 
tobacco use in late chronotypes. Relatedly, increases in affective states such as anger [64] 
and impulsivity [65] following smoking cessation predict relapse while cessation has been 
reported by early chronotypes as “easier” [66]. Promoting adequate sleep and earlier sleep 
preference and timing may be a viable smoking cessation intervention component.

 The association between longer sleep duration and late chronotype with lower levels of 
physical activity found in this study was marginal, but did converge with a small number of 
other studies examining this question [40, 67, 68]. More noteworthy was the finding that 
long sleepers accrued on average 0.61 more television viewing hours per day than adequate 
sleepers. Previous work has been mixed in this area. One other study also found long sleep 
duration to be associated with more television viewing than adequate sleep [69], while data 
from the American Time Use Survey showed an inverse relationship between sleep duration 
and amount of time spent watching television [70]. The importance of long sleepers 
reporting significantly more television viewing time lies in the fact that sedentary behavior is 
an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease [71, 72]. For example, ten or more 
hours of sitting per day increased cardiovascular diseases risk by 18 % (Hazard ratio = 1.18; 
95% CI = 1.09–1.29) as compared to five or fewer hours [73], while four or more hours 
(versus ≤1) of screen-based sedentary behavior per day (TV and recreational computer use) 
was associated with an adjusted twofold greater prevalence (Prevalence Ratio = 2.09; 95 % 
CI = 1.16, 3.75) of insulin levels indicative of hyperinsulinemia (N20 μU/mL) [74]. 
Sedentary behavior is also highly associated with higher body mass index and lower activity 
levels [75, 76]. This potential clustering of negative behaviors (television viewing, higher 
body mass index, low physical activity) represents a group at high risk for cardiovascular 
disease.
Longer sleep duration and late chronotype were associated with lower daily fruit and 
vegetable intake, in fact, early chronotypes consumed 0.25 more servings of fruit and 0.133 
more servings of vegetables daily than late chronotypes. Consistent with these data, previous 
studies have also shown late chronotypes to have less healthful dietary habits and a tendency 
for a higher body mass index (BMI) [27, 77]. In terms of relating fruit and vegetable intake 
to risk for cardiovascular disease, a recent meta-analysis showed that adults consuming five 
daily servings of fruit and vegetables (∼400 g) had a 15 % reduced risk of CVDs, while 
those consuming 2.5 daily servings (∼200 g) had a 8 % reduced risk of CVDs compared to 
adults who did not eat any fruit and vegetables over a 10.5-year follow-up period [78]. Thus, 
even incremental differences in daily fruit and vegetable consumption could impact disease 
risk across time.
Our findings that more healthful cardiovascular health behaviors (i.e., more physical activity, 
less screen-based sedentary behavior, higher fruit and vegetable intake, non-tobacco use) 
was associated with early chronotype could also be at least partially explained by personality 
factors. Conscientiousness has been identified as the strongest personality predictor of 
diurnal preference [79], with early chronotype and conscientiousness being highly correlated 
[80]. Early chronotype is also associated with traits related to conscientiousness including 
lower levels of procrastination [81] and higher levels of self-control and emotional stability 
[81, 82]. Given that conscientiousness has been positively associated with habitual physical 
activity [83] and negatively associated with body mass index [84] and current tobacco use 
[85], it could be argued that personality characteristics are an integral part of explaining the 
variance in chronotype and positive health behaviors.
Collectively, our data show that short and long sleepers (i.e., non-adequate sleepers) and late 
chronotypes may benefit from clinical and population level approaches to encourage

 adequate sleep duration and earlier sleep/wake timing. From a health behavior perspective, 
the multiple health behavior change (MHBC) framework has been gathering momentum in 
the last decade [86, 87]. One of the central themes of the MHBC framework is the 
consideration of the sequencing of behaviors to change. For example, does change in one 
behavior incite behavior change in another [88], or is a concurrent approach more effective? 
[89]. Sleep is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [90] and this 
population analysis has shown that sleep is significantly associated with all three of the main 
risk behaviors for poor heart health. Together, this presents the hypothesis that sleep duration 
and timing may both directly and indirectly affect cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 
Indirectly, sleep may influence the incidence and severity of tobacco use, inactivity, and poor 
dietary intake. On this basis, it could be argued that promoting adequate sleep and earlier 
wake/sleep timing may be a necessary precursor in the MHBC sequence of achieving 
optimal change in tobacco, activity, and dietary behaviors.
Reshaping of environmental features to adjust sleep timing and promote adequate sleep 
represents plausible intervention approaches to improving sleep. For example, increasing 
light exposure in the natural environment shifts sleep timing earlier [91], while exposure to 
ambient light at night either from ereaders [92] or urban lighting [93] promotes “lateness.” 
Noise from air conditioning and fans [94] and street noise relate to poorer sleep quality [94, 
95] while improvements in urban housing quality [96] also improve sleep. Given the current 
data showing the vulnerability of long sleepers and late chronotypes to poor heart health 
behaviors, consideration of how environment structures can be manipulated to promote 
better sleep may be important for better cardiovascular health.
The current study is one of the first large-scale population studies to concurrently evaluate 
the association between the sleep metrics of duration and chronotype with physical activity, 
screen-based sedentary behavior, tobacco use, and dietary intake. Main limitations include 
the use of self-report behavioral data and a cross-sectional design that prevents consideration 
of the temporal relationship between these variables. These data should also be interpreted 
with consideration of the fact that the sleep duration variable did not distinguish between 
work days and free days [13] and that portion size for fruit and vegetable intake used UK 
(not USA) guidelines. Moreover, choronotype was estimated using self-categorization and 
not clock times that would have allowed the identification of the sleep mid-point [97]. 
Nevertheless, these results showing that long sleepers and late chronotypes are more 
vulnerable to negative heart health behaviors represent a novel and important contribution to 
this literature. Further work in this area is needed to determine whether objective measures 
of these (and other) sleep metrics are predictive of heart health behaviors in a diverse sample 
across time and subsequently whether improving sleep (i.e., achieving adequate sleep 
duration, earlier timing) effectively promotes heart health. The interactive effects of sleep 
duration and timing on cardiovascular risk behaviors and outcomes also warrant 
consideration. The elucidation of sleep as a novel behavioral target for heart health 
promotion may be a key to reaching the American Heart Association's goal of a 20 % 
improvement in cardiovascular health before the year 2020.
