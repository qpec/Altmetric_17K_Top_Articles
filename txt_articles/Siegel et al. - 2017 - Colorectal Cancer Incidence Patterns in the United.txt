Abstract
Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in the United States is declining rapidly overall but, curiously, is increasing
among young adults. Age-specific and birth cohort patterns can provide etiologic clues, but have not been recently examined.
Methods: CRC incidence trends in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results areas from 1974 to 2013 (n ¼ 490 305) were
analyzed by five-year age group and birth cohort using incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and age-period-cohort modeling.
Results: After decreasing in the previous decade, colon cancer incidence rates increased by 1.0% to 2.4% annually since the
mid-1980s in adults age 20 to 39 years and by 0.5% to 1.3% since the mid-1990s in adults age 40 to 54 years; rectal cancer inci-
dence rates have been increasing longer and faster (eg, 3.2% annually from 1974–2013 in adults age 20–29 years). In adults age
55 years and older, incidence rates generally declined since the mid-1980s for colon cancer and since 1974 for rectal cancer.
From 1989–1990 to 2012–2013, rectal cancer incidence rates in adults age 50 to 54 years went from half those in adults age 55
to 59 to equivalent (24.7 vs 24.5 per 100 000 persons: IRR ¼ 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 0.92 to 1.10), and the proportion
of rectal cancer diagnosed in adults younger than age 55 years doubled from 14.6% (95% CI ¼ 14.0% to 15.2%) to 29.2% (95%
CI ¼ 28.5% to 29.9%). Age-specific relative risk by birth cohort declined from circa 1890 until 1950, but continuously increased
through 1990. Consequently, compared with adults born circa 1950, those born circa 1990 have double the risk of colon cancer
(IRR ¼ 2.40, 95% CI ¼ 1.11 to 5.19) and quadruple the risk of rectal cancer (IRR ¼ 4.32, 95% CI ¼ 2.19 to 8.51).
Conclusions: Age-specific CRC risk has escalated back to the level of those born circa 1890 for contemporary birth cohorts,
underscoring the need for increased awareness among clinicians and the general public, as well as etiologic research to eluci-
date causes for the trend. Further, as nearly one-third of rectal cancer patients are younger than age 55 years, screening initi-
ation before age 50 years should be considered.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rates have been declining in
the United States for several decades, with the pace accelerating
to 3% annually from 2003 to 2012 (1). The reduction in risk from
1975 to 2000 is attributed equally to changes in the prevalence
of risk factors and the uptake of screening (2), while the recent
steep decline is thought to be primarily driven by screening. A
recent study speculated that underlying CRC risk also continues
to decline (3), while others have reported increasing risk in
adults younger than age 50 years, for whom screening is not
recommended for those at average risk (4–8). However, none of
these studies examined the temporal pattern simultaneously
by age, calendar period, and year of birth for a comprehensive
interpretation of the contemporary trend. To our knowledge,
the last paper that examined trends in CRC by period and birth
cohort was published in 1994 based on data through 1990 (9).
Herein, we characterize trends in population-based CRC occur-
rence by tumor location, age at diagnosis, and year of birth
using incidence data from 1974 to 2013 and age-period-cohort
modeling (10). Age-period-cohort modeling is a quantitative
tool used to enhance the understanding of disease trends by

 attempting to disentangle factors that influence all ages (period
effects), such as changes in medical practice, from those that
vary by generation (cohort effects), typically as a consequence
of behavioral changes.
Methods
Study Design and Data Source
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients age 20
years and older diagnosed with invasive CRC from 1974 through
2013 in the nine oldest Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) Program areas (Atlanta [from 1975], Connecticut,
Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Seattle-Puget Sound, San
Francisco-Oakland, and Utah) (11,12). The SEER program is the
only source for historical population-based cancer incidence in
the United States and is considered the gold standard for cancer
registration worldwide because of the high quality of data.
Diagnosis years 1974–2013 were selected to utilize the most
recent available data while maintaining equivalent time period
and age intervals, which are required for age-period-cohort
modeling. Cases were stratified by tumor subsite (colon, ICD-O-
3 codes C18.0, C18.2-C18.9, C26.0 [proximal colon, C18.0, C18.2-
C18.4; distal colon, C18.5-C18.7]; rectum, C19.9, C20.9) and
excluded appendiceal malignancies, which are considered dis-
tinct from those arising in the colorectum (13). Five percent of
colon tumors were coded as overlapping or unspecified ana-
tomic location and could not be included in subsite analysis.
Because incidence trends during this time period are the same
in men and women (14), data were not stratified by sex to
improve statistical power.
Statistical Analysis
SEER*Stat (version 8.3.2; National Cancer Institute [NCI]) was
used to access CRC cases and calculate delay-adjusted inci-
dence rates, which correct for the lag in case capture affecting
recent data years (15), and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with
accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All tests of statis-
tical significance were two-sided, and a P value of less than .05
was considered statistically significant. Incidence rate ratios
were considered statically significant when the 95% confidence
interval did not include one. Incidence rates were calculated for
eleven age groups (20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–54, 55–59. . .80–84,
85þ), presented per 100 000 person-years, and age-adjusted to
the 2000 US standard population for collective age groups (eg,
age > 55 years). The magnitude and direction of temporal trends
were quantified using the Joinpoint Regression Program (ver-
sion 4.3.1.0; NCI), which uses permutation analysis to fit a series
of joined straight lines on a logarithmic scale to observed rates
to estimate the annual percent change (APC) and average
annual percent change (16). We calculated the change in pro-
portion of cases diagnosed in young adults (defined as age < 55
years based on like contemporary incidence trends) between
1989–1990 and 2012–2013 by adjusting to the 2012–2013 popula-
tion in order to account for temporal shifts in underlying age
distribution.
Birth cohort models were fitted using NCI’s Age Period
Cohort web tool (17). Age-period-cohort modeling provides esti-
mates of parameters that describe relationships between observed
incidence rates and age, calendar period, and birth cohort based
on age groups and time periods of equal length (18). Input data
were case and population counts for eight five-year time periods
(1974–1978, 1979–1983...2009–2013) and 14 five-year age groups
(20–24, 25–29. . .80–84, 85þ) spanning 21 partially overlapping
10-year birth cohorts. Cohorts are referred to by mid-year of
birth (1889, 1894. . .1989) corresponding to patients born begin-
ning in 1887 through 1991. Cohort effects are presented graphi-
cally as IRRs adjusted for age and calendar period effects. To
facilitate data interpretation, we chose reference values corre-
sponding to the 1949 cohort, which had the lowest rates. (The
choice of reference values is arbitrary and does not affect the
interpretation of results.) We also present the local drift, which
estimates the age-specific net annual percent change in inci-
dence rates. Heat maps of residuals by age vs period were con-
structed to screen for systematic lack of fit. In addition, we
examined how well observed rates agreed with confidence
bands from the age-period-cohort model when the former
were plotted together with the latter (Supplementary Figure 1,
available online).
Results
There were 490 305 patients age 20 years and older diagnosed
with CRC in the nine oldest SEER registries during 1974–2013.
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, colon cancer incidence
rates were declining in age groups younger than age 50 years
and increasing in those age 50 years and older (Figure 1).
Conversely, from the mid-1980s through 2013, rates declined in
adults age 55 years and older, while increasing by 2.4% per year
in adults age 20–29 years and by 1.0% per year in adults age 30–
39 years. In the mid-1990s, rates also began increasing in adults
age 40 to 49 years (1.3% per year) and 50 to 54 years (0.5% per
year). Increasing trends in adults younger than age 50 years
were confined to tumors in the distal colon, with the exception
of adults age 40 to 49 years, among whom rates are also increas-
ing for proximal tumors (Supplementary Table 1, available
online). This is also the only age group for which tumors of
unspecified or overlapping location are increasing. Notably,
declines in adults age 55 years or older were also generally
larger for distal than for proximal tumors.
Compared with colon cancer, incidence trends for rectal can-
cer are more prolonged for all age groups and the rise in young
adults is steeper. Specifically, rectal cancer incidence rates
increased by 3.2% per year from 1974 to 2013 in adults age 20 to
29 years and since 1980 in adults age 30 to 39 years, and by 2.3%
per year since beginning in the 1990s in adults age 40 to 49 years
and 50 to 54 years (Figure 2). In contrast, rates generally
declined throughout the entire 40-year study period in adults
age 55 years and older. The stronger, more sustained trends for
rectal than for colon tumors are reflected in a notable crossover
in the local drift, with rectal cancer incidence exhibiting a net
increase of 3.9% to 4.0% annually in adults age 20 to 29 years
coupled with a net decrease of 2.1% or more annually in adults
age 75 and older (Figure 3A).
Oppositional trends by age are also causing a convergence in
CRC incidence rates in adults age 50 to 54 years and 55 to 59
years (Supplementary Figure 1, available online). Whereas in
the early 1990s both colon and rectal cancer incidence rates in
adults age 50 to 54 years were half those in adults age 55 to 59
years, in 2012 to 2013 they were just 12.4% lower for colon (31.9
vs 36.4: IRR ¼ 0.88, 95% CI ¼ 0.81 to 0.94) and equivalent for rec-
tum (24.7 vs 24.5: IRR ¼ 1.01, 95% CI ¼ 0.92 to 1.10). In addition,
the age-adjusted proportion of incident cases in adults age 55
years and younger increased from 11.6% (95% CI¼ 11.1% to 12.2%)
in 1989–1990 to 16.6% (95% CI ¼ 16.0% to 17.1%) in 2012 to 2013 for

 colon cancer and from 14.6% (95% CI ¼ 14.0% to 15.2%) to 29.2%
(95% CI ¼ 28.5% to 29.9%) for rectal cancer.
Age-period-cohort modeling of CRC incidence data indicates
both period and cohort effects, with deviations for each gener-
ally statistically significantly different from zero, particularly
for rectal cancer (Supplementary Figure 2, available online).
Quantitatively, however, period effects were dwarfed by cohort
effects, with cohort deviations 10-fold higher than period devia-
tions. Further, the local drift (net age-specific annual percent
change) was statistically significant for all ages for colon cancer
and, with the exception of adults age 50 to 54 years for rectal
cancer (Figure 3A), consistent with the age-specific trend for
that group shown in Figure 2.
Age-specific trends by birth cohort are presented as incidence
rate ratios, for which the 1949 cohort is the referent group.
Relative risks decreased for consecutive cohorts born from the
late 1880s until the 1940s, then increased for subsequent cohorts
(Figure 3B). Specifically, compared with people born circa 1950,
those born circa 1890 had double the age-specific risk of colon
cancer (IRR ¼ 2.12, 95% CI ¼ 1.91 to 2.36) and triple the risk of rec-
tal cancer (IRR ¼ 3.06, 95% CI ¼ 2.71 to 3.47). These age-specific
relative risks are comparable with those for the youngest birth
cohort for both colon (IRR¼ 2.40, 95% CI ¼ 1.11 to 5.19) and rectal
cancer (IRR¼ 4.32, 95% CI ¼ 2.19 to 8.51), despite wider confidence
intervals because data are limited to young individuals, who have
substantially lower disease rates. While the increase for colon can-
cer is primarily driven by distal tumors, risk for proximal tumors
also appears to be increasing (Supplementary Figure 3, available
online). Age-specific incidence trends by year of birth confirm the
strong cohort effect (Supplementary Figure 4, available online).
Residual analysis conducted to evaluate the goodness of fit of the
age-period-cohort models revealed adequate agreement between
the modeled and observed data (Supplementary Figure 1, available
online).
Discussion
We found variations in CRC incidence patterns by age, tumor sub-
site, calendar period, and particularly birth cohort. The age-specific
risk of CRC dropped for successive generations in the first half of
the twentieth century, but has escalated back to the level of those
born circa 1890 for current birth cohorts. The cohort effect was
qualitatively similar for colon and rectal cancers, but quantita-
tively larger for rectal cancer, for which there was a net increase
of 4% annually for people in their 20s coinciding with a net
decrease of 2% annually for those age 75 years and older. As a
consequence of these oppositional trends, the probability of a
rectal cancer diagnosis for someone in their early 50s is now the
same as it is for someone in their late 50s, whereas two decades
ago it was just half.
In contrast to colon cancer, rectal cancer incidence has gen-
erally been declining in age groups older than 55 years since at
least 1974, well before widespread screening, which was self-
reported at less than 25% in 1987 (19). This may partly reflect
detection and removal of precancerous lesions during clinical
inspection of the rectum, which was common practice well
before formal CRC screening (20). Inherent differences within
the colorectum in the way environmental factors initiate and/or
promote carcinogenesis (21), as well as the influence of unknown
risk factors, may also have contributed.
While early-onset CRC has a familial component more often
than late-onset disease, the majority of cases are sporadic (22).
The strong birth cohort effects we observed signal relatively
recent changes in exposures that influence risk. Established
lifestyle factors associated with CRC include excess body
weight, high consumption of processed meat and alcohol, low
levels of physical activity and fiber consumption, and cigarette
smoking (23,24). The rise in CRC in young adults has likely been
attenuated by long-term declines in alcohol consumption and
smoking (25), but fueled by increases in cumulative exposure to
excess body fat, which have been demonstrated by studies of
obesity trends by birth cohort (26). It is not surprising that the
timing of the obesity epidemic parallels the rise in CRC because
many behaviors thought to drive weight gain, such as unhealthy
dietary patterns and sedentary lifestyles (27), independently
increase CRC risk. Moreover, there are undoubtedly complex epi-
genetic interactions between obesity, sedentary behavior, and
diet (28,29). Evolving research suggests that specific, unhealthy
dietary elements, like high–glycemic load carbohydrates, may

 trigger a cascade of detrimental health effects beyond caloric
content (30). A recent study found that de novo introduction of a
Western-style high-fat, low-fiber diet initiates inflammation and
proliferation in the colonic mucosa within two weeks (31). These
findings are consistent with the one-generation jump in CRC
risk that has been observed among Japanese migrants to the
United States that is attributed to diet (32).
Some of the increased CRC in recent birth cohorts may be
due to the detection of prevalent subclinical disease because of
rising colonoscopy utilization for diagnostic and screening pur-
poses. According to the National Health Interview Survey, 13.6%
of adults age 40 to 49 years reported having a colonoscopy in
the past 10 years in 2013, compared with 6.4% in 2000
(Supplementary Table 2, available online) (33). During 2000 to
2011, approximately 17% of colonoscopies were performed in
patients younger than age 50 years based on data from the
National Endoscopic Database (34). Nevertheless, this is prob-
ably not a driving factor for the trends in early-onset disease
because the most rapid gains are for individuals in their 20s and
30s, who are least likely to be screened. Moreover, rates have
risen at a similar magnitude for early- and advanced-stage dis-
ease (7), which is inconsistent with a screening effect.
While primary prevention is the preferable course of action
for cancer control, improving health behaviors and further iden-
tifying etiologic agents for CRC are long-term endeavors. In the
meantime, a number of actions should be taken to ameliorate
the rising burden of CRC in young adults. One is to educate the
public and clinicians about the rising probability of disease in
people younger than age 55 years. Young patients are 58% more
likely than older patients to be diagnosed with distant- vs
localized-stage CRC (35), largely due to delayed follow-up of
symptoms, sometimes for years (36), because cancer is typically
not on the radar of young adults or their providers (37). Another
obstacle to timely diagnosis is less access to medical care;
adults younger than age 55 years are three times more likely to
be uninsured than those age 55 years and older—22% vs 7% in
2013 (38). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) may facilitate earlier
detection for young CRC patients, as it has for other malignan-
cies (39). The Commonwealth Fund ACA Tracking Survey
reported that the proportion of adults age 19 to 34 years who
were uninsured reduced from 28% in 2013, prior to the first
open enrollment, to 18% in 2016, following the third open
enrollment, with a similar decline (18% to 11%) among adults
age 35 to 49 years (40).
Rapid declines in CRC incidence in the past decade in age
groups older than 55 years are likely the result of increased
uptake of screening, which rose from 38% in 2000 to 59% in 2013
in adults age 50 years or older (33). The larger decreases for dis-
tal than proximal tumors may reflect the longstanding effects
of fecal occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopy, which
were the most common screening modalities among older
adults until 2005, and possibly higher efficacy of colonoscopy
for preventing distal cancers (41–43). However, our finding of
rising CRC incidence rates for people in their early 50s, as well
as younger age groups, highlights the need for increased adher-
ence to recommended screening. Guidelines state that screen-
ing should commence at age 50 years for individuals at average
risk of disease, but earlier for those at increased risk, which
includes people with a family history of CRC or adenomatous
polyps (44). Despite these recommendations, among people
with an affected first-degree relative, those younger than age 50
years are half as likely to have had a colonoscopy as those age 50
years or older (45). Nationally, colonoscopy prevalence is lower
in adults age 50 to 54 years than in adults age 55 to 59 years,
although temporal trends are similar; reported receipt of a
colonoscopy in the past 10 years increased from 14% in 2000 to
41% in 2013 in adults age 50 to 54 years and from 16% to 52% in
adults age 55 to 59 years (Supplementary Table 2, available
online). While national surveys do not collect information on
age at screening initiation, one population-based study of non-
Hispanic whites with higher-than-average educational attain-
ment, one-quarter of whom were employed in health care,
found a mean age at CRC screening initiation of 55 years (46).
Reversing increasing trends in adults age 50 to 54 years
requires not only increased adherence to screening guidelines
but also screening before age 50 years because the full benefit of
polypectomy for preventing CRC requires about a decade to
realize (47,48). Beginning screening at age 45 years is not sup-
ported by a recent review of the evidence for CRC screening
(49,50) and would add approximately 20 million people to the
screening-eligible population. Yet it is worth noting that in 2013
there were about 10 400 new CRCs diagnosed in adults age 40 to
49 years and 12 800 cases in adults age 50 to 54 years, similar to
the total number of cervical cancers (12 300) (51), for which
screening of 95 million women age 21 to 65 years is recom-
mended (52). Moreover, Cancer Intervention and Surveillance
Modeling Network (CISNET) researchers recently reported that
beginning screening at age 45 years is “more effective and pro-
vided a more favorable balance between life-years gained and
screening burden than starting at age 50 years” (49). Endoscopic
screening could be particularly useful in stemming the tide of
tumors in the distal colon and rectum (53), which are prepon-
derant in young patients.
Our study is somewhat limited by its ecologic nature and the
assumptions of the age-period-cohort model, specifically that
interactions between age and period can be well described as a
birth cohort phenomenon. Also, although the data fit our mod-
els well, existing models do not incorporate information on
population-level screening or risk factors. Hence, parameters
can help identify emerging trends and generate etiologic
hypotheses, but the results do not provide any direct evidence
about the role of specific exposures or interventions. Even so, as
incidence trends in young adults often provide a bellwether of
the future disease burden, our results are sobering. Additionally,
long-term population-based cancer occurrence data in the
United States are limited to nine SEER registries, and thus may
not be generalizable to the broader population. However, a
recent analysis of age-specific CRC incidence trends from 1998 to
2009 based on national data reported results similar to ours and
those of other SEER-based studies (4,6).
In summary, the age-specific risk of a CRC diagnosis dropped
for successive generations in the first half of the twentieth cen-
tury, but escalated back to the level of those born in the late
1800s for current birth cohorts. As the proportion of rectal
cancer diagnosed in adults younger than age 55 years years
has doubled in just two decades, adherence to guideline-
recommended screening initiation should be emphasized and
initiation before age 50 years should be reconsidered. These
results highlight the need for etiologic research to elucidate
causes for the underlying increase in disease risk in young birth
cohorts, as well as creative new strategies to curb the obesity
epidemic and shift Americans toward healthier eating and
more active lifestyles. Beyond awaiting scientific discovery and
the widespread adoption of healthier living, meaningful action
can be taken to mitigate premature morbidity and mortality
from this disease through educational campaigns about the
importance of timely follow-up of CRC symptoms, regardless of
patient age, and age-appropriate screening.
