Summary
Background Understanding the amount of tuberculosis managed by the private sector in India is crucial to 
understanding the true burden of the disease in the country, and thus globally. In the absence of quality surveillance 
data on privately treated patients, commercial drug sales data off
 er an empirical foundation for disease burden 
estimation.
Methods We used a large, nationally representative commercial dataset on sales of 189 anti-tuberculosis products 
available in India to calculate the amount of anti-tuberculosis treatment in the private sector in 2013–14. We corrected 
estimates using validation studies that audited prescriptions against tuberculosis diagnosis, and estimated uncertainty 
using Monte Carlo simulation. To address implications for numbers of patients with tuberculosis, we explored 
varying assumptions for average duration of tuberculosis treatment and accuracy of private diagnosis.
Findings There were 17·793 million patient-months (95% credible interval 16·709 million to 19·841 million) of anti-
tuberculosis treatment in the private sector in 2014, twice as many as the public sector. If 40–60% of private-sector 
tuberculosis diagnoses are correct, and if private-sector tuberculosis treatment lasts on average 2–6 months, this implies 
that 1·19–5·34 million tuberculosis cases were treated in the private sector in 2014 alone. The midpoint of these ranges 
yields an estimate of 2·2 million cases, two to three times higher than currently assumed.
Interpretation India’s private sector is treating an enormous number of patients for tuberculosis, appreciably higher 
than has been previously recognised. Accordingly, there is a re-doubled need to address this burden and to strengthen 
surveillance. Tuberculosis burden estimates in India and worldwide require revision.

Introduction
Tuberculosis is a major global public health challenge.1 
In 2014, 6·3 million cases of tuberculosis worldwide 
were reported to WHO, with India accounting for over a 
quarter of these cases, the highest of any country.1 
Although standardised tuberculosis treatment in India is 
delivered by the public sector through the Revised 
National TB Control Programme (RNTCP), early 
diagnosis and treatment are hampered by the presence 
of a vast and unregulated private health-care sector.2–5 
Poor diagnostic practices in this sector prolong tuber-
culosis transmission by delaying diagnosis,3,5,6 whereas a 
general lack of counselling and support of treatment 
adherence hampers successful, relapse-free cure.4 More-
over, most cases treated in the private sector are never 
notifi
 ed to public health authorities.7
Estimating the numbers of patients being treated in 
the private sector is important for several reasons: it 
provides information about the performance of a public 
system in detecting tuberculosis cases, while also 
helping in planning for government intervention in the 
private sector.8 Overall, it is crucial to know the scale of 
the problem: the undetected burden that exists outside 
the public health system. However, with a lack of 
systematic data on the private sector, arriving at these 
estimates has proven diffi
  cult.9 Instead, alternative 
approaches—such as that used by WHO—draw from 
expert opinion on the proportion of cases that are 
detected by the public sector.
In this work, we present an alternative approach. We 
build on earlier, innovative work that addressed the 
private market for tuberculosis drugs using com-
prehensive data on the sales of these drugs in the private 
sector.10 In the present study, using corresponding data 
for 2013 and 2014, we explored systematically the 
implications for tuberculosis burden (numbers of 
patients) being managed by the private sector in India, 
and compared this burden directly against that managed 
by the public sector.
Methods
Overview
We drew from a large, nationally representative dataset 
for private sector drug sales across the country, collected 
by the organisation IMS Health. We limited the analysis 
to 189 drugs containing rifampicin, which have fewer 
non-tuberculosis 
indications 
than, 
for 
example, 
fl
 uoro 
 
quinolones. These 189 products capture all

rifampicin-containing drugs being sold in India between 
2013 and 2014. All products were fi
 xed-dose combinations 
or branded drugs: they were thus sold only in the private 
sector and not the public sector, which uses diff
 erent 
product forms (including loose pills) under non-
proprietary names.
We aimed to estimate the treatment volume, or the 
total patient-months of treatment for tuberculosis in the 
private sector, taking account of both the proportion of 
prescriptions for a given drug that are for tuberculosis, 
and the proportion of total drug sales that are captured by 
IMS Health data. We found estimates at the state level in 
India, as well as on the national level, for 2013 and 2014. 
We also estimated 95% credible intervals, informed by 
uncertainty in the input parameters.
Calculating volume (patient-months) of treatment
Each product is uniquely identifi
 ed by its product code, 
indexed i in the analysis. We defi
 ne the following 
parameters for data in a given state and year: Ni is the IMS 
data for total packs of product i sold, ci is the proportion of 
total sales of product i that are captured by IMS data, mi is 
the total months of tuberculosis treatment represented by 
one pack of product i, and pi is the proportion of pre-
scriptions containing product i that are for tuberculosis.
When each of these quantities is specifi
 ed, the total number 
of patient-months of treatment (PM), in a given state and 
year, is then given by a sum over all product codes i: 
That is, adjusting sales data (Ni) for IMS data coverage 
(ci), the duration of treatment associated with each 
product form (mi) and the indications for tuberculosis 
versus other diseases (pi). Ni is measured directly. In 
practice, each of the remaining parameters carries some 
uncertainty, which we captured by modelling them as 
random variables, using distributions described below. 
Using Latin hypercube sampling, we took 10 000 samples 
for each of the parameters (ci, mi, and pi over all product 
codes i), and then calculated PM for each sample using the 
equation. From the resulting ensemble of 10 000 estimates 
for PM, we then obtained the point estimate for the 
patient-months using the median, and the uncertainty 
intervals using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles. We then 
repeated this process for each state and year.
Data sources and probability distributions for input 
parameters
For the total drug sales Ni we used state-specifi
 c data from 
the IMS Health Drug Sales Audit. These are monthly drug 
sales data reported to IMS Health by a recruited panel of 
stockists. We collected monthly drug sales data using 
invoices raised for sales of goods to retailers and sub-
stockists, hospitals and hospital retailers, and dispensing 
doctors. Overall, IMS Health’s combined drug sales audit 
in the retail, hospital, and dispensing doctors sectors was 
estimated to account for over 87% of the total Indian 
pharmaceutical market in 2014.11
For the proportion of prescriptions pi of product i that 
are for tuberculosis, we drew from the IMS Medical 
Health Audit, consisting of monthly prescription data 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Not all incident cases of tuberculosis are reported to public health 
authorities: WHO estimates overall tuberculosis incidence in India 
by estimating the proportion of incident cases that are notifi
 ed 
(the case detection rate [CDR]), and dividing published 
tuberculosis notifi
 cations by this fraction. In 2014, this approach 
suggested that over 800 000 tuberculosis cases in India escaped 
diagnosis by the public health-care system: most of these cases 
are assumed to have been treated in the private sector. However, 
CDR estimates are based on expert opinion, with the most recent 
estimate varying substantially from previous years. We searched 
PubMed for all studies with keywords “India”, “tuberculosis”, 
“private”, and “burden”, fi
 nding 25 studies for articles published 
in English from inception until May 31, 2016. Most of these 
related to the quality of tuberculosis care, whereas one study from 
2011 assessed the amount of drug sales in the private sector in 
India and nine other countries. With a focus on market size 
estimates, this study also presented an illustrative estimate for 
how many patients were on treatment for tuberculosis.
Added value of this study
There is a need for systematic estimates of private sector 
tuberculosis burden that are independent of expert opinion. 
We used updated data from 2013 and 2014 for 
anti-tuberculosis drug sales in the private sector in India, 
adjusted for indication of use and data capture. With that 
empirical data, we built on previous work by systematically 
exploring the eff
 ect of assumptions of duration of treatment, 
and the extent of over-diagnosis of tuberculosis, on the 
number of patients treated in the private sector. Although 
there is limited evidence for either of these parameters, we 
modelled a range of scenarios to assess the feasibility of 
current estimates based on expert opinion.
Implications of all the available evidence
Tuberculosis treatment in the private sector is considerably 
greater than previous estimates suggest, and estimates of 
tuberculosis disease burden for India are implausibly low. 
This study illustrates the need to address the burden of 
tuberculosis treated by the private sector and improve 
surveillance. This study also raises an urgent need to revise 
current estimates of tuberculosis burden, informed by more 
systematic evidence relating to tuberculosis management in 
the private sector.

from a panel of 4600 doctors following internationally 
recognised medical practice, and translating to over 
800 000 prescriptions every month. The panel of doctors is 
recruited through a sampling exercise that takes into 
account the region, specialty type, and patient turnover. In 
these data, if product i has P prescriptions of which T are 
for tuberculosis, then we modelled pi as a β-distributed 
random variable, with shape and scale parameters T + 1 
and P – T + 1, respectively. Data are available at the regional 
level, but not at the state level. Accordingly, for each state 
we selected the data from the relevant region.
For mi, we again drew from the Medical Health Audit 
data. In particular, prescriptions of product code i have a 
certain frequency distribution, available from the audits. 
Putting this together with the duration of treatment 
associated with each dose, we constructed the probability 
distribution for the number of months associated with 
each prescription of product code i. Again, since these 
data are only regionally stratifi
 ed, for each state we used 
the corresponding, region-specifi
 c estimates.
Finally for ci, we used data from IMS Health data 
validation studies. In brief, at the end of each year, 
pharmaceutical companies subscribed to IMS are supplied 
with IMS estimates for their yearly sales volume, for 
comparison with their actual sales volume. Not all 
rifampicin-containing products are included in these 
studies. Accordingly, for each product code in the present 
work (analysis products), we estimated ci using those 
products in the validation study (validation products) 
having a comparable volume of sales. In parti 
cular, we 
grouped validation products by volume (whether high, 
moderate, or low volume products), found the mean and 
variance for each volume category, and then modelled IMS 
coverage within each category as a normal distribution. By 
categorising analysis products in the same way, we 
modelled ci for each required product using the normal 
distribution from the relevant volume category.
Implications of treatment volume for burden (numbers 
of patients)
Given an estimate of PM in a given year, the 
corresponding number of patients receiving tuber-
culosis treatment is given by PM / D, where D is the 
average duration (in months) for which patients take

tuberculosis treatment in the private sector. However, 
not all of these patients might genuinely have 
tuberculosis. To adjust for potential overdiagnosis, we 
incorporated the positive predictive value (PPV) of 
tuberculosis diagnosis in the private sector (ie, the 
proportion of people diagnosed with tuberculosis in the 
private sector who genuinely have tuberculosis). 
Therefore, overall the number of patients with tuber-
culosis receiving private-sector treatment in a given 
year is estimated simply as PM × (PPV / D). In the 
absence of systematic, quantitative estimates for these 
parameters, we present results for a range of scenarios 
for PPV and D.
Patient-months of treatment in the public sector
To compare against the amount of treatment in the public 
sector, we used RNTCP notifi
 cations and, for simplicity, 
assumed 6 months of treatment for new cases and 
9 months of treatment for retreatment. Because some 
patients might not complete treatment even in the public 
sector, this approach yields an upper bound for patient-
months of treatment. Consequently, this approach would 
tend to be conservative with respect to the relative amount 
of treatment in the private versus public sectors (ie, tending 
to underestimate this quantity).

Results
Table 1 shows estimates for the total patient-months of 
treatment (PM) in the private sector in 2013 and 2014, 
with a comparison against corresponding numbers in 
the public sector. Overall, estimates are stable between 
the years, although there is noticeable variation between 
states in the relative amount of treatment between private 
and public sectors. At one extreme, Orissa shows the 
public sector having 1·5–2·8 times as many PM as the 
private sector (taking the inverse of the ratios shown). At 
the other extreme, the private sector in Bihar provides 
over three times as many PM as the public sector. Overall, 
on a national level in both years, there was roughly twice 
as much tuberculosis treatment in the private sector as in 
the public sector. Although the analysis focuses on 
rifampicin-containing drugs, other tuberculosis drugs 
(isoniazid and ethambutol) showed similar sales volumes 
on a national level over this period (appendix).
To translate these population estimates to numbers of 
patients being treated (whether or not they are genuine 
tuberculosis cases), table 2 shows estimates for 2014 
under diff
 erent scenarios ranging from 3 months to 
9 months, with a comparison against numbers of 
patients registered for treatment under RNTCP. The 
appendix shows corresponding estimates for 2013.
Finally, to estimate actual burden of tuberculosis cases in 
the private sector, the fi
 gure shows estimates for 2014, under 
a range of scenarios for the PPV of tuberculosis diagnosis in 
the private sector, and for the average duration of treatment 
in the private sector. For illustration, and in the absence of 
systematic data on either of these parameters, the diamond 
marks a moderate set of parameter values: if a patient 
diagnosed with tuberculosis in the private sector undergoes 
4 months of treatment on average, and if 50% of tuberculosis 
diagnoses in the private sector are genuine cases of 
tuberculosis, then these fi
 gures suggest that 2·2 million 
genuine cases of tuberculosis were treated in the private 
sector in 2014 (compared with 1·42 million patients treated 
in the public sector in the same year). This estimate 
increases when assuming higher values for PPV, and when 
assuming shorter average treatment duration.

Discussion
The vast and fragmented private health-care sector is a 
prominent feature in the health landscape of India. In 
the context of tuberculosis, this sector is diffi
  cult to study 
and systematically characterise, yet remains crucial for 
understanding and managing the overall burden of 
tuber 
culosis. In this work, we took advantage of 
systematic collection of drug sales data in the private 
sector to address this gap, presenting new estimates that 
suggest the burden of tuberculosis might be considerably 
higher than previously recognised.
The key output of this approach is the volume (patient-
months) of patient treatment in the private sector, which 
is twice as much as that provided in the public sector. On 
any given day, this translates on average to 1·46 million 
people being on tuberculosis treatment, more than 0·12% 
of the country’s population. Moreover, tuber 
culosis 
treatment in the private sector is typically paid for by out-
of-pocket expenditure; if a 6-month course of fi
 rst-line, 
anti-tuberculosis medication costs US$20, our estimates 
imply that in 2014, over $59 million was spent in out-of-
pocket expenditure on fi
 rst-line tuberculosis drugs alone.
Estimates by WHO use expert opinion for case detection 
rates to project from notifi
 cations to overall incidence.9 The 
most recent estimates imply that in 2014 about 
800 000 patients went untreated by the public sector.1 Recon-
ciling these estimates with 17·8 million patient-months of 
private-sector treatment in 2014 would require either a very 
low PPV (27% if assuming a 6-month treat 
ment duration) 
or a long treatment duration (over 11 months if assuming a 
PPV of 50%). Instead, taking plausible ranges of 40–60% 
for PPV and 2–6 months for treat 
ment duration suggests 
that in 2014 alone, 1·19–5·34 million tuberculosis patients 
received private-sector tuberculosis treatment. The mid-
point in this range corresponds to a private-sector 
tuberculosis burden of 2·2 million cases, more than twice 
the burden suggested by previous assumptions.
Our fi
 ndings have implications for the tuberculosis 
strategy in India. First, the vast disorganised private 
health-care sector poses major challenges to tuberculosis 
control. India’s RNTCP has committed to providing free, 
high-quality tuberculosis care to patients in the private 
sector.12 Initiatives such as private-sector engagement to 
improve tuberculosis care in this sector, off
 er potential 
mechanisms for realising these goals.8 In this context, our 
results suggest that the scale of the challenge is sub-
stantially larger than has hitherto been appreciated. These 
fi
 ndings underscore the need for redoubled eff
 orts to 
reach patients being treated in the private sector, to deliver 
the highest possible standards of tuberculosis care.
Second, our work points to the urgent need for further 
strengthening of tuberculosis surveillance in the private 
sector. Although there has been increasing notifi
 cation of 
tuberculosis cases by the private sector to public health 
authorities, these accounted in 2014 for 106 414 patients13—a 
level far below that estimated here. Emerg 
ing initiatives, 
such as the proposed provision of free, daily-dosed 
tuberculosis treatment to all those needing it in the private 
sector, could bring about important steps in this direction.14
Third, our fi
 ndings highlight uncertainty around the true 
burden of tuberculosis in India. Methods for estimating 
this burden should be complemented by independent 
approaches generating primary data. In addition to the 
surveillance needs mentioned above, a national prevalence 
survey would provide direct evidence for the numbers of 
patients receiving treatment in the private sector. Moreover 
model-based approaches, such as the Global Burden of 
Disease study,15 off
 er the capability to collate disparate but 
important sources for estimating tuberculosis burden. In 
future, fi
 ndings such as those presented here could 
constitute an additional source of evidence for refi
 ning 
these and other analytical approaches.
Previous work on the role of the private sector used 
interviews of patients diagnosed with tuberculosis in 
30 districts in India, to estimate that nearly half of patients 
were on treatment outside RNTCP.2 Relying as it does on 
self-reported tuberculosis, these estimates can be inter-
preted as a lower bound of the amount of tuberculosis 
treatment in the private sector. Another study, also using 
drug sales in the private sector, cast valuable light on the 
private market for diff
 erent tuberculosis drugs.10 Our 
fi
 ndings for overall treatment volumes in India are broadly 
consistent. Moreover, Delhi features prominently in our 
results for the amount of private-sector treatment relative 
to the public sector (table 1). This result is consistent with

Figure: Implications of treatment volume in 2014 for tuberculosis burden managed by the private sector in India
Estimates are shown for the number of patients with tuberculosis treated by the private sector (see colour bar for 
numbers in millions), under diff
 erent scenarios for the average duration of treatment in the private sector, and the 
proportion of private-sector tuberculosis diagnoses that genuinely have tuberculosis. The diamond illustrates a 
moderate parameter regime, in which 50% of diagnoses in the private sector genuinely have tuberculosis, and the 
average treatment duration is for 4 months. This corresponds to an estimated 2·2 million patients being treated in the 
private sector in 2014.

other fi
 ndings in the city,16 where engagement with private 
sector providers led to a greater than ten times increase in 
tuberculosis notifi
 cations, indicative of a large tuberculosis 
burden being managed by this sector. Although it might 
be tempting to hold India’s large informal health sector 
responsible for the observed high usage of tuberculosis 
drugs, recent work from India, using standardised 
patients, show that anti-tuberculosis drugs are rarely 
dispensed by pharmacists, informal providers, and 
practitioners of alternative medical systems.6,17 Thus, 
qualifi
 ed, allopathic doctors in India are the primary 
source of anti-tuberculosis drug prescriptions, and should 
be the target of engagement and antimicrobial stewardship 
eff
 orts.
Our approach has some limitations. First, we do not have 
reliable estimates for the PPV of tuberculosis diagnosis in 
the private sector, nor for the mean duration of treatment 
(D) in the private sector. The estimates that we present for 
numbers of patients with tuberculosis, under diff
 erent 
scenarios, should thus be taken as illustrative, and not 
defi
 nitive. Estimating such para 
meters in a systematic way 
is a real challenge. None 
theless, new methods are emerging, 
such as the use of standardised patients to assess the quality 
of tuberculosis care in this sector.6 In future, these and other 
approaches could be valuable in quantifying PPV and D 
more precisely, and more broadly for systematically 
studying the private health-care sector.
Second, in the simple estimates in the fi
 gure, we 
neglect complexities such as the potential for a patient to 
receive treatment in the private sector fi
 rst, and 
subsequently in the public sector. However, a nationally 
representative study18 in 2010 estimated that such patients 
accounted for about 8% of all tuberculosis cases that 
were notifi
 ed in that year. These fi
 ndings suggest that the 
numbers are not so great as to considerably bias our 
estimates. Further work could aim to extend these 
fi
 ndings to more recent years.
Third, there are several types of patient with tuber-
culosis that the data do not capture. For example, those 
who could be receiving treatment for tuberculosis in the 
informal health-care sector, those who have not contacted 
the health-care system, or those being treated for 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the private sector. 
Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that some patients 
could be treated for tuberculosis with other drugs such as 
fl
 uoroquinolones in the private sector,6 although there is 
no systematic evidence for the proportion of patients 
receiving these drugs in combination with rifampicin-
containing products. Nonetheless, taken together, all these 
factors would suggest that the true burden of tuberculosis 
is even greater than suggested in the present analysis.
Overall, the approach described here cannot replace 
traditional approaches to surveillance, including routine 
notifi
 cations and periodic surveys. There remains a 
pressing need to strengthen and widen these systems. 
Nonetheless, the implications of this analysis could off
 er 
additional perspectives on such a vast and complex 
health-care system as in India. In future these and other 
approaches, in combination with existing and improved 
sources of data, could help to build a truly comprehensive 
picture of the burden of tuberculosis in India.
