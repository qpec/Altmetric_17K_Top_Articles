BACKGROUND
The 70-gene signature test (MammaPrint) has been shown to improve prediction of 
clinical outcome in women with early-stage breast cancer. We sought to provide prospec-
tive evidence of the clinical utility of the addition of the 70-gene signature to standard 
clinical–pathological criteria in selecting patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.
METHODS
In this randomized, phase 3 study, we enrolled 6693 women with early-stage breast cancer 
and determined their genomic risk (using the 70-gene signature) and their clinical risk (using 
a modified version of Adjuvant! Online). Women at low clinical and genomic risk did not re-
ceive chemotherapy, whereas those at high clinical and genomic risk did receive such therapy. 
In patients with discordant risk results, either the genomic risk or the clinical risk was used 
to determine the use of chemotherapy. The primary goal was to assess whether, among pa-
tients with high-risk clinical features and a low-risk gene-expression profile who did not re-
ceive chemotherapy, the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the rate of 5-year 
survival without distant metastasis would be 92% (i.e., the noninferiority boundary) or higher.
RESULTS
A total of 1550 patients (23.2%) were deemed to be at high clinical risk and low ge-
nomic risk. At 5 years, the rate of survival without distant metastasis in this group was 
94.7% (95% confidence interval, 92.5 to 96.2) among those not receiving chemotherapy. 
The absolute difference in this survival rate between these patients and those who re-
ceived chemother 
apy was 1.5 percentage points, with the rate being lower without chemo-
therapy. Similar rates of survival without distant metastasis were reported in the subgroup 
of patients who had estrogen-receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2–negative, and either node-negative or node-positive disease.
CONCLUSIONS
Among women with early-stage breast cancer who were at high clinical risk and low 
genomic risk for recurrence, the receipt of no chemotherapy on the basis of the 70-gene 
signature led to a 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis that was 1.5 percent-
age points lower than the rate with chemotherapy. Given these findings, approximately 
46% of women with breast cancer who are at high clinical risk might not require chemo-
therapy. (Funded by the European Commission Sixth Framework Program and others;

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
W
omen with early-stage breast 
cancer are often treated with adjuvant 
systemic therapy consisting of chemo-
therapy, endocrine therapy, agents against human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), or 
combinations of these drugs when appropriate. 
Treatment decisions are based on characteristics 
of the tumor (hormonal receptor and HER2 status, 
tumor grade and size, and lymph-node status) and 
of the patient (age, menopausal status, and per-
formance status).1 Tools that incorporate these 
features, such as Adjuvant! Online2,3 and PREDICT 
Plus,4 were created to assist in such decision 
making. However, these algorithms do not take 
into account the individual biologic characteris-
tics of the patient’s tumor.5 A substantial num-
ber of patients with breast cancer are overtreated 
and are thus being exposed to the risk of toxic 
effects from adjuvant therapy without deriving 
significant benefit. In 2007, respondents to an 
international survey identified the use of mo-
lecular signatures to select patients who could 
be spared adjuvant therapy as a high priority.6
Gene-expression profiling studies have distin-
guished at least four molecularly distinct types of 
breast cancer.7,8 Several genomic tests have been 
developed to better predict clinical outcome and 
to determine whether the addition of adjuvant 
chemotherapy to endocrine therapy is worth-
while.8,9 One such test, the 70-gene signature10 
(MammaPrint), classifies tumors into groups 
that are associated with a good prognosis or a 
poor prognosis on the basis of the risk of distant 
recurrence at 5 years and at 10 years.11 An inde-
pendent validation study by the TRANSBIG con-
sortium, a network of some 40 partners in 21 
countries associated with the Breast Interna-
tional Group (BIG), confirmed that the 70-gene 
signature, which has been approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), is able to distin-
guish patients who are at significant risk for 
distant relapse and death from those at low risk.12
In this international, prospective, randomized, 
phase 3 study, called the Microarray in Node-
Negative and 1 to 3 Positive Lymph Node Dis-
ease May Avoid Chemotherapy (EORTC 10041/
BIG 3-04 MINDACT) study, we sought to provide 
evidence of the clinical utility13-15 of the addition 
of the 70-gene signature to standard clinical–
pathological criteria in selecting patients for adju-
vant chemotherapy.16,17 Here, we report 5-year 
outcomes and the results of the treatment ran-
domization for groups with discordance in risk.
Methods
Study Patients
From 2007 through 2011, we enrolled patients at 
112 institutions in nine European countries. Eli-
gible patients were women between the ages of 
18 and 70 years with histologically confirmed 
primary invasive breast cancer (stage T1 or T2 or 
operable T3). In the initial study design, all the 
patients had to have lymph-node–negative dis-
ease, as described in the protocol, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org. As of 
August 2009, the protocol was revised to allow 
the enrollment of women with up to three posi-
tive axillary nodes.18 The study design called for 
following all the patients according to local 
standards for at least 10 years; those receiving 
endocrine therapy will be followed for a mini-
mum of 15 years.
Written informed consent was obtained from 
all the patients. The protocol review committee 
of the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the ethics 
committee at each participating site approved 
the study.
Prognostic Tools
We used the 70-gene signature to determine 
genomic risk and Adjuvant! Online (version 8.0 
with HER2 status) (www.adjuvantonline.com) to 
determine clinical risk (Fig. S7 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). De-
tails regarding clinical risk assessment accord-
ing to the modified version of Adjuvant! Online 
are provided in Table S13 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
A frozen sample of the resected tumor was 
shipped on dry ice to Agendia for molecular 
diagnostic testing. The quantification of the 
tumor-cell percentage was followed by 70-gene 
profiling embedded in a whole-transcriptome 
array that is cleared for use by the FDA.19,20
Categorization into Risk Groups
A low clinical risk was defined as the 10-year 
probability of breast-cancer–specific survival with-
out systemic therapy of more than 88% among 
women with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive 
tumors and more than 92% among women with 
ER-negative tumors, to account for the 4-percent-
age-point average absolute benefit of adjuvant 
endocrine therapy for ER-positive tumors. Pa-
tients with low-risk disease according to both

70-Gene Signature in Early Breast Cancer
clinical and genomic results were advised not to 
receive adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas patients 
who were categorized as having high-risk dis-
ease by both tests were advised to receive chemo-
therapy.
Patients with discordant results (i.e., either 
high clinical risk and low genomic risk or low 
clinical risk and high genomic risk) were ran-
domly assigned to the chemotherapy group or the 
no-chemotherapy group on the basis of either 
the clinical result or the genomic result. The 
treatment randomization used a minimization 
technique that was stratified according to in-
stitution, risk group, hormone-receptor status 
(ER-positive or progesterone [PR]-positive vs. 
ER-negative and PR-negative), nodal involvement 
(yes or no), age (<50 years vs. ≥50 years), HER2 
status (HER2-positive vs. HER2-negative vs. un-
known), axillary treatment (sentinel node only vs. 
dissection), and type of surgery (mastectomy 
vs. breast conservation).
Additional (optional) randomizations were im-
plemented in which patients who were assigned 
to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (either random-
ly because of discordant results or because of 
high-risk concordance of both tests) could be 
randomly assigned to receive an anthracycline-
containing regimen or a docetaxel-plus-capecita-
bine regimen. Similarly, patients with hormone-
receptor–positive breast cancer could undergo 
further randomization to a tamoxifen–letrozole 
regimen or a letrozole-only regimen. Details re-
garding the various therapy regimens are pro-
vided in the legend for Figure S7 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Protocol Revisions
A change in the RNA-extraction solution that 
was used in the calculation of the 70-gene sig-
nature (a change that was not communicated by 
the manufacturer) caused a temporary shift in 
the risk calculation from May 24, 2009, to Janu-
ary 30, 2010, at which time the issue was discov-
ered and rectified (Table S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Because of this shift, 162 patients 
who had been identified as being at high ge-
nomic risk were subsequently identified as being 
at low genomic risk with the use of the correct 
solution (Tables S2 and S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The retroactively recalibrated results 
were communicated to the independent data and 
safety monitoring committee, to all members 
of the ethics committees, to the investigators 
(who oversaw informing the patients), and to the 
TRANSBIG ethics committee. The clinical effect 
of this risk revision was that an additional 28 
patients received chemotherapy before the re-
sults were corrected, although no patient was 
undertreated (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). For 113 additional patients, the des-
ignations of clinical or genomic risk were cor-
rected after enrollment, owing mainly to incor-
rect reporting of tumor characteristics at the 
time of enrollment (Tables S2 and S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The actual risk after 
the correction of all types of errors is referred to 
as the “corrected risk.”
The sample size was modified during the 
trial from 6000 patients to 6600 patients because 
the proportion of patients who were designated 
as being at low clinical and genomic risk was 
higher than was initially projected and because 
of the need to compensate for the change in 
solution used in RNA extraction.
Study End Points
The primary end point was survival without dis-
tant metastasis (event-free rate at 5 years), as 
assessed in a time-to-event analysis. Secondary 
end points were the proportion of patients who 
received chemotherapy according to the clinical 
risk as compared with the genomic risk as well 
as overall survival and disease-free survival, as 
assessed in time-to-event analyses. Survival with-
out distant metastasis was defined as the time 
until the first distant metastatic recurrence or 
death from any cause. Disease-free survival was 
defined as the time until first disease progres-
sion (locoregional, distant relapse, ipsilateral or 
contralateral invasive breast cancer, ductal carci-
noma in situ, or an invasive second primary 
cancer) or death from any cause. Overall sur-
vival was defined as the time until death from 
any cause. Data for patients who had no event at 
the cutoff date for the final analysis were cen-
sored at the time of the last disease assessment 
for survival without distant metastasis and for 
disease-free survival and at the last follow-up 
date for overall survival.
Study Oversight
The trial was overseen by the independent data 
and safety monitoring committee of the EORTC. 
A logistics pilot study validated the real-time 
centralized analysis of frozen samples in several 
European countries.19 The MINDACT pilot phase

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
(involving the first 800 enrolled patients) con-
firmed the feasibility of the study.21 Central 
pathological review revealed high concordance 
between local and central assessments22,23 (Table 
S12 in the Supplementary Appendix).
All randomizations were performed centrally, 
initially at the International Drug Development 
Institute and, as of 2010, at the EORTC. Genom-
ic profiling was performed by Agendia. The 
drugs that were administered during the study 
were provided by Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, and 
F. Hoffmann–La Roche, which had no other role 
in the study, were not involved in the collection 
or analysis of the data, and did not contribute to 
the writing of the manuscript. Data collection 
and statistical analyses were performed at the 
EORTC. The analyses and the final version of the 
manuscript were approved by all the authors, 
who vouch for the accuracy and completeness of 
the data and the adherence of the study to the 
protocol.
Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis was designed to test 
whether, among patients with high-risk clinical 
features and a low-risk gene-expression profile 
who did not receive chemotherapy, the lower 
boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the 
rate of 5-year survival without distant metastasis 
would be 92% (i.e., the noninferiority boundary) 
or higher, at a one-sided significance level of 
0.025. The primary test was to be performed 
when two conditions were met: the standard 
error for the rate of survival without distant metas-
tasis at 5 years was 0.01 or less and the percent-
age of patients in the primary-test population 
with 5-year follow-up was 33% or more. A two-
sided 95% confidence interval for the 5-year rate 
of survival without distant metastasis of more 
than 92% was considered to indicate statistical 
significance. Under these conditions, this test 
has 80% power to reject the null hypothesis if 
the true 5-year rate of survival without distant 
metastasis is 95%.
In addition, three secondary analyses were 
planned. In the first analysis, we evaluated the 
outcomes in patients in the discordant-risk 
groups according to whether they were assigned 
to the chemotherapy group or the no-chemo-
therapy group. In the second analysis, we evalu-
ated outcomes in all patients according to 
whether the use of chemotherapy had been rec-
ommended by either clinical risk or genomic 
risk alone. To have an unbiased estimate for this 
analysis, data for patients in the discordant-risk 
groups were doubly weighted, because they were 
underrepresented by a factor of two in the re-
sulting sample. In the third analysis, we calcu-
lated the percentage of all enrolled patients who 
would be assigned to chemotherapy on the basis 
of either clinical risk or genomic risk.
In the first two secondary analyses, we report 
the results according to the risk category and 
treatment assignment at the time of enrollment 
(intention-to-treat population). In the third sec-
ondary analysis and in all analyses according to 
risk group (namely, those for outcome, patient 
characteristics, eligibility, and adherence), we 
report the results according to the corrected 
risk group.
Exploratory analyses that were defined pro-
spectively in the protocol or in the statistical 
analysis plan or that were deemed to be of high 
clinical relevance are so described in the text 
and in the Supplementary Appendix. All analy-
ses were performed with the use of SAS soft-
ware, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Study Patients
The cutoff date for the current analysis was 
March 1, 2016; the median follow-up was 5.0 
years. Between 2007 and 2011, a total of 11,288 
patients underwent screening and 6693 were 
enrolled in the study (Fig. S7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Of the 4595 patients (40.7%) 
who underwent screening but were not enrolled, 
the main reasons were the unsuitability of tu-
mor material for testing, a decision by the pa-
tient or an investigator not to participate in the 
study, or other ineligibility factor (Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
The patients were divided into four main 
groups, according to their clinical and genomic 
risk: low clinical risk and low genomic risk, 
which included 2745 patients (41.0%); low clini-
cal risk and high genomic risk, which included 
592 patients (8.8%); high clinical risk and low 
genomic risk, which included 1550 patients 
(23.2%); and high clinical risk and high genomic 
risk, which included 1806 patients (27.0%). 
These numbers were calculated on the basis of 
the corrected risk (Fig. 1, and Table S2 in the

70-Gene Signature in Early Breast Cancer
Figure 1. Enrollment and Risk Groups Included in the Analyses.
Patients were categorized into four risk groups on the basis of the 70-gene signature to determine genomic risk and Adjuvant! Online to determine clinical risk. Patients were fur-
ther categorized according to their “corrected risk” after the discovery of risk changes due to factors including a change in the RNA-extraction solution while the study was ongoing 
(genomic risk) and incorrect reporting of clinical risk at enrollment (clinical risk). In the analyses according to risk group (namely, those for outcome, patient characteristics, eligibil-
ity, and adherence), the results are reported according to the corrected risk. The primary analysis was conducted in the primary-test population. This population included patients 
at high clinical risk and low genomic risk, who were randomly assigned to use the genomic risk for the decision to forgo chemotherapy and who adhered to the treatment assign-
ment of no chemotherapy. Patients with changes in clinical or genomic risk were excluded from the primary-test population. Treatment-randomization analyses for the groups with 
discordant clinical and genomic risks were performed with the use of the risk at enrollment (intention-to-treat population). In the intention-to-treat population, patients were ana-
lyzed according to the randomized group, irrespective of adherence. The treatment-randomization analyses were repeated in the per-protocol population, which excluded patients 
who were ineligible, had a change in their clinical or genomic risk, or were nonadherent to the treatment assignment. (Patients could have more than one reason for exclusion.)

70-Gene Signature in Early Breast Cancer
Supplementary Appendix). For reference, the 
clinical classification that is based on the modi-
fied version of Adjuvant! Online is provided in 
Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The characteristics of the patients and the 
tumors are provided in Table 1. The median age 
of the patients was 55 years (range, 23 to 71); 
79.0% of the patients had node-negative disease, 
and 20.9% had one to three positive nodes. 
(Micrometastases measuring 0.2 to 2 mm were 
considered to be node-positive, and isolated tu-
mor cells were considered to be node-negative.) 
A total of 88.4% of the tumors expressed ER, PR, 
or both, and 9.5% were HER2-positive.
Eligibility and Adherence in the Discordant-
Risk Groups
A total of 75 patients (1.1%) were found to be 
ineligible. In the discordant-risk groups, overall 
adherence to the chemotherapy assignment was 
86%. Among patients who were at high clinical 
risk and low genomic risk, the rate of adherence 
was 85% among those in the chemotherapy 
group and 89% among those in the no-chemo-
therapy group. Among patients at low clinical 
risk and high genomic risk, the rates of adher-
ence were 80% and 88%, respectively (Table S11 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary Outcome
The criteria for the primary analysis were met: 
the percentage of patients with 5-year follow-up 
was 60% (>33%), and the standard error for the 
rate of survival without distant metastasis at 
 
5 years was 0.0094 (<0.01). At 5 years, patients 
who were at high clinical risk and low genomic 
risk who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy 
(primary-test population) had a rate of survival 
without distant metastasis of 94.7% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 92.5 to 96.2); thus, the pri-
mary objective of the study (i.e., to show whether 
the lower boundary of the 95% confidence inter-
val for the rate of survival without distant metas-
tasis would be at least 92%) was achieved.

Data were missing for one patient at high clinical and low genomic risk with respect to tumor size, lymph-node status, and hormone- 
receptor status. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. ER denotes estrogen receptor, HER2 human epidermal growth factor 
 
receptor, and PR progesterone receptor.
†  
A majority of patients at high clinical risk and low genomic risk (54%) had tumors measuring 2 to 5 cm in diameter. Most of the patients 
at low clinical and genomic risk (96%) and at low clinical and high genomic risk (98%) had tumors measuring 2 cm or less, as did 52% of 
the patients at high clinical and genomic risk.
‡  
More than three quarters (76%) of patients at high clinical and genomic risk had grade 3 tumors. Most patients at low clinical and genomic 
risk, low clinical and high genomic risk, and high clinical and low genomic risk had grade 1 or 2 tumors (98%, 85%, and 71%, respectively).
§ 
 
The presence of negative lymph nodes was substantially more frequent among patients at low clinical and genomic risk (94%) and low clini-
cal and high genomic risk (97%) than among patients at high clinical and low genomic risk (52%) and high clinical and genomic risk (74%).
¶  
Almost all tumors were positive for hormone receptors except among patients at high clinical and genomic risk, in whom 38% of tumors 
were hormone-receptor–negative. Hormone receptor positivity was defined as the presence of at least 1% of immunoreactive cells, an 
Allred score of more than 2 (on a scale from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating a greater number of receptors), or a level of cytosolic 
protein of at least 10 fmol per milligram.

HER-2 positivity was reported in 4% of patients at low clinical and genomic risk, 12% of those at low clinical and high genomic risk, 8%  
of those at high clinical and low genomic risk, and 19% of those at high clinical and genomic risk.
**  
Specifically, among patients at high clinical and low genomic risk, 48% had node-positive disease, 58% of tumors measured 2 cm or more, 
and 90% had the luminal HER2-negative subtype.

Prespecified Secondary Analyses
Chemotherapy versus no Chemotherapy
Among patients in the intention-to-treat popula-
tion at high clinical risk and low genomic risk at 
enrollment, those who underwent randomiza-
tion on the basis of clinical risk (and therefore 
received chemotherapy) had a 5-year rate of 
survival without distant metastasis of 95.9% 
(95% CI, 94.0 to 97.2), whereas those who un-
derwent randomization on the basis of genomic 
risk (and therefore received no chemotherapy) 
had a rate of 94.4% (95% CI, 92.3 to 95.9) — 1.5 
percentage points lower than the rate among 
those who received chemotherapy (adjusted haz-
ard ratio for distant metastasis or death with 
chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy, 0.78; 95% 
CI, 0.50 to 1.21; P 
= 
0.27) (Fig. 2A and Table S15 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Among patients at low clinical risk and high 
genomic risk, those who underwent randomiza-
tion on the basis of genomic risk (and therefore 
received chemotherapy) had a 5-year rate of sur-
vival without distant metastasis of 95.8% (95% 
CI, 92.9 to 97.6), as compared with a rate of 
95.0% (95% CI, 91.8 to 97.0%) among those who 
underwent randomization on the basis of clini-
cal risk (and therefore received no chemother-
apy) (adjusted hazard ratio for distant metastasis 
or death with chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy, 
1.17; 95% CI, 0.59 to 2.28; P 
= 
0.66) (Fig. 2B). 
This finding does not show any advantage of 
directing therapy on the basis of genomic risk 
among patients at low clinical risk but high ge-
nomic risk, since these patients had no benefit 
from the use of adjuvant chemotherapy.
In addition, among patients in the discordant-
risk groups, there was no significant difference 
between the chemotherapy group and the no-
chemotherapy group with respect to disease-free 
survival (Fig. 2C and 2D) and overall survival 
(Fig. 2E and 2F). Sensitivity analyses in the per-
protocol population are provided in Table 2. 
Data regarding intervals without distant metas-
tasis are shown in Figure S6 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Genomic Risk versus Clinical Risk
Overall, 3356 patients were categorized as being 
at high clinical risk (1550 with low genomic risk 
and 1806 with high genomic risk), and 2398 
were categorized as being at high genomic risk 
(592 with low clinical risk and 1806 with high 
clinical risk). Thus, of the 6693 patients, the dif-
ference between the two strategies (clinical risk 
vs. genomic risk) for chemotherapy administra-
tion would be 958 patients (14.3%). Among all 
patients at high clinical risk, the use of the 70-
gene signature to guide chemotherapy treatment 
would lead to a reduction in the use of adjuvant 
chemotherapy in 1550 of 3356 patients (46.2%).
Chemotherapy Recommendation on the Basis  
of Only Clinical or Genomic Risk
We also estimated outcomes in all patients if 
the use of chemotherapy had been recommend-
ed by either clinical risk or genomic risk alone. 
At 5 years, the rate of survival without distant 
metastasis would have been 95.0% with the 
clinical-risk strategy alone and 94.7% with the 
genomic-risk strategy alone — in other words, 
with similar outcomes but with a much lower 
use of chemotherapy according to the genomic-
risk strategy (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Prespecified Exploratory Analyses
We also conducted a subgroup analysis accord-
ing to nodal status with data from patients at 
high clinical risk and low genomic risk. Among 
patients with node-negative disease, the rate of 
survival without distant metastasis was 95.7% 
(95% CI, 93.0 to 97.4) in the chemotherapy group 
and 93.2% (95% CI, 90.1 to 95.4) in the no-
Figure 2 (facing page). Survival without Distant 
 
Metastasis, Disease-free Survival, and Overall Survival 
in the Two Discordant-Risk Groups, According to 
 
Randomized Treatment.
Shown are the three major survival outcomes — survival 
without distant metastasis (Panels A and B), disease-
free survival (Panels C and D), and overall survival 
(Panels E and F) — among patients with discordant 
risk (i.e., high clinical risk and low genomic risk or low 
clinical risk and high genomic risk), according to the 
randomized treatment. This analysis was performed in 
the intention-to-treat population, which included patients 
who had discordant risk at the time of enrollment and 
who were analyzed according to treatment assignment. 
Time-to-event curves were estimated by means of the 
Kaplan–Meier method. The insets show the same data 
on an expanded y axis.

chemotherapy group; among patients with node-
positive disease, the rates were 96.3% (95% CI, 
93.1 to 98.1) in the chemotherapy group and 
95.6 (95% CI, 92.7 to 97.4) in the no-chemother-
apy group (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). In the subgroup of patients with ER-posi-
tive, HER2-negative, and node-negative disease, 
the rate of survival without distant metastasis 
was 95.5% (95% CI, 92.5 to 97.3) among patients 
in the chemotherapy group and 93.9% (95% CI, 
90.6 to 96.1) in the no-chemotherapy group, a 
survival rate that was 1.6 percentage points 
lower among patients who did not receive chemo-
therapy than among those who did (Fig. S5 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Figure 3 shows the survival without distant 
metastasis for the four risk groups among all 
enrolled patients. (Rates of disease-free and 
overall survival are provided in Table S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.) Overall, 362 of 6693 
patients (5.4%) either had distant metastasis (in 
266 patients [73.5%]) or died from any cause in 
the absence of distant recurrence (96 patients 
[26.5%]).
The 70-gene signature was significantly asso-
ciated with survival without distant metastasis 
after adjustment for chemotherapy use, clinical 
risk, and patient and tumor characteristics in a 
multivariate analysis (hazard ratio for distant 
metastasis or death with chemotherapy vs. no 
chemotherapy, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.79 to 3.26 for

70-Gene Signature in Early Breast Cancer
Discussion
In our study, we found important tradeoffs with 
respect to the use of the 70-gene signature in 
patients with early-stage breast cancer who were 
deemed to be at high risk for recurrence on the 
basis of clinical and pathological factors. At a 
median follow-up of 5 years, patients who were 
classified as high risk according to clinical–
pathological factors and who therefore would 
have been usual candidates for adjuvant chemo-
therapy were able to forgo chemotherapy on the 
basis of a low genomic risk, which resulted in a 
rate of survival without distant metastasis that 
was an average of 1.5 percentage points lower 
than the rate among those who received chemo-
therapy. Among these patients at high clinical 
risk and low genomic risk, 48% had node-positive 
disease, 93% had grade 2 or 3 disease, and 34% 
were 50 years of age or younger — all features 
that usually indicate high risk. Similar results 
were obtained for the subgroup of patients with 
ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors, as well as for 
subgroups of patients who had node-negative 
disease or who had one to three positive nodes.
We found an overall discordance rate of 32% 
between the two risk-assignment methods. For 
patients at high clinical risk who had one posi-
tive node (801 patients) or two or three positive 
nodes (405 patients), the 70-gene signature indi-
cated a low risk of disease for 505 (63.0%) and 
226 (55.8%), respectively. Therefore, the study 
suggests that the biologic characteristics of the 
tumor are as important as tumor burden with 
respect to treatment decisions and patients’ out-
comes, even among patients with one to three 
positive nodes.
We report 5-year median follow-up results. It 
is recognized that adjuvant chemotherapy exerts 
most of its beneficial effects early in the course 
of the disease (i.e., during the first 5 years), thus 
justifying our primary end point.24 Since the 
majority of tumors in our study population were 
considered to be “luminal,” with a continuing 
risk of relapse beyond 5 years, we acknowledge 
that long-term follow-up and outcome data will 
be essential, and we are collecting those data. 
Hazards for events can have a complex time de-
pendence, and Adjuvant! Online and the 70-gene 
signature were validated for 10-year outcomes; 
therefore, the planned 10-year follow-up analysis 
may be of interest.
At 5 years, patients who were classified as 
being at high risk according to both clinical and 
genomic methods had the lowest rate of survival 
without distant metastasis (90.6%), whereas 
those who were classified as being at low risk by 
both methods had the highest rate (97.6%) and 
those with discordant assessments had an inter-
mediate rate (approximately 95%) (Table S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). We used Adjuvant! 
Online for clinical prediction, since it provided a 
practical and homogeneous way of assessing 
clinical–pathological risk and created a trans-
parent, unambiguous control group. The dichoto-
mous cutoff was chosen by a consensus of all 
TRANSBIG partners, including patient represen-
tatives, to define a situation in which the abso-
lute benefit of chemotherapy would balance its 
associated side effects. However, a risk–benefit 
assessment and decisions with respect to the use 
of adjuvant chemotherapy are subjective and 
highly variable among physicians, and even na-
tional and international guidelines differ in their 
recommendations. Ultimately, the decision to re-
ceive or forgo chemotherapy (or any other treat-
ment) lies with each patient who is properly in-
formed about the potential side effects and the

potential benefits of such treatment. For the 
same risk–benefit scenario, different patients may 
make different decisions.
In the critical group of patients at high clini-
cal risk and low genomic risk, the use of adjuvant 
chemotherapy led to a trend toward a higher rate 
of the 5-year outcome than that with no chemo-
therapy, which included a rate of survival with-
out distant metastasis that was 1.5 percentage 
points higher, a rate of disease-free survival that 
was 2.8 percentage points higher, and a rate of 
overall survival that was 1.4 percentage points 
higher with chemotherapy than with no chemo-
therapy in the intention-to-treat population and 
a rate of survival without distant metastasis that 
was 1.9 percentage points higher, a rate of dis-
ease-free survival that was 3 percentage points 
higher, and a rate of overall survival that was 
1.5 percentage points higher with chemotherapy 
than with no chemotherapy in the per-protocol 
population. The study was not powered to assess 
the statistical significance of these differences.
Some 50% of the study patients were defined 
as being at low clinical risk. In this group, we 
did not find any meaningful difference in the 
5-year rate of survival without distant metasta-
sis between patients at high genomic risk who 
received chemotherapy and those who did not 
receive chemotherapy. On the basis of these 
data, the results for the 70-gene signature do not 
provide evidence for making recommendations 
regarding chemotherapy for patients at low 
clinical risk. In clinical practice, genomic testing 
is best used in combination with clinical–patho-
logical factors, since the gene signature has an 
added and independent prognostic value.
In conclusion, in a large group of patients at 
high clinical risk for breast-cancer recurrence, 
the addition of the 70-gene signature to the tra-
ditional clinical and pathological factors pro-
vided valuable information for considering which 
patients might benefit from adjuvant chemo-
therapy. We found that chemotherapy with its 
attendant toxic effects could be avoided in these 
patients at high clinical risk but low genomic 
risk at a cost of a risk of distant metastasis at 
5 years that is 1.5 percentage points higher. 
Follow-up is ongoing to determine whether 
these conclusions remain valid for longer-term 
outcome.
