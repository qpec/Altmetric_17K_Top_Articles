Background and aims: Currently there is considerable interest in ketone metabolism
owing to recently reported benefits of ketosis for human health. Traditionally, ketosis
has been achieved by following a high-fat, low-carbohydrate “ketogenic” diet, but
adherence to such diets can be difficult. An alternative way to increase blood
D-β-hydroxybutyrate (D-βHB) concentrations is ketone drinks, but the metabolic effects
of exogenous ketones are relatively unknown. Here, healthy human volunteers took
part in three randomized metabolic studies of drinks containing a ketone ester (KE);
(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, or ketone salts (KS); sodium plus potassium
βHB.
Methods and Results: In the first study, 15 participants consumed KE or KS drinks
that delivered ∼12 or ∼24 g of βHB. Both drinks elevated blood D-βHB concentrations
(D-βHB Cmax: KE 2.8 mM, KS 1.0 mM, P < 0.001), which returned to baseline within
3–4 h. KS drinks were found to contain 50% of the L-βHB isoform, which remained
elevated in blood for over 8 h, but was not detectable after 24 h. Urinary excretion of
both D-βHB and L-βHB was <1.5% of the total βHB ingested and was in proportion to
the blood AUC. D-βHB, but not L-βHB, was slowly converted to breath acetone. The
KE drink decreased blood pH by 0.10 and the KS drink increased urinary pH from 5.7
to 8.5. In the second study, the effect of a meal before a KE drink on blood D-βHB
concentrations was determined in 16 participants. Food lowered blood D-βHB Cmax by
33% (Fed 2.2 mM, Fasted 3.3 mM, P < 0.001), but did not alter acetoacetate or breath
acetone concentrations. All ketone drinks lowered blood glucose, free fatty acid and
triglyceride concentrations, and had similar effects on blood electrolytes, which remained
normal. In the final study, participants were given KE over 9 h as three drinks (n = 12) or a
continuous nasogastric infusion (n = 4) to maintain blood D-βHB concentrations greater
than 1 mM. Both drinks and infusions gave identical D-βHB AUC of 1.3–1.4 moles.min.
Conclusion: We conclude that exogenous ketone drinks are a practical, efficacious
way to achieve ketosis.

Exogenous Ketone Metabolism
INTRODUCTION
Human’s ability to produce and oxidize ketone bodies arguably
evolved to enhance survival during starvation by providing
an energy source for the brain and slowing the breakdown
of carbohydrate and protein stores (Owen et al., 1967; Sato
et al., 1995; Marshall, 2010). The brain is normally reliant on
carbohydrate as a substrate, being less able to metabolize lipids,
despite adipose tissue representing a far larger energy store
than muscle and liver glycogen. Therefore, during starvation,
lipids are used for hepatic ketogenesis and, via ketone bodies,
lipids sustain the brain. Endogenous production of the ketone
bodies, D-β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc),
increases slowly, driven by interactions between macronutrient
availability (i.e., low glucose and high free fatty acids) and
hormonal signaling (i.e., low insulin, high glucagon and cortisol).
Produced continuously under physiological conditions, blood
ketone concentrations increase during starvation (Cahill, 1970),
when consuming a “ketogenic” (low carbohydrate, high-fat) diet
(Gilbert et al., 2000) or following prolonged exercise (Koeslag
et al., 1980).
Ketogenic diets have been successfully used to treat diseases
that have an underlying metabolic component, effectively
decreasing seizures in recalcitrant pediatric epilepsy (Kossoff
et al., 2003), lowering blood glucose concentrations in type 2
diabetes mellitus (Feinman et al., 2015) and aiding weight-loss
(Bueno et al., 2013). Emerging evidence supports several clinical
uses of ketogenic diets, for example in neurodegenerative diseases
(Vanitallie et al., 2005), specific genetic disorders of metabolism
(Veech, 2004) and as an adjunct to cancer therapy (Nebeling
et al., 1995). Ketone bodies themselves may underlie the efficacy
of the ketogenic diet, either through their role as a respiratory
fuel, by altering the use of carbohydrate, protein and lipids
(Thompson and Wu, 1991; Cox et al., 2016), or through other
extra- and intracellular signaling effects (Newman and Verdin,
2014). Furthermore, ketone metabolism may offer a strategy
to improve endurance performance and recovery from exercise
(Cox et al., 2016; Evans et al., 2017; Holdsworth et al., 2017;
Vandoorne et al., 2017). However, achieving compliance to a
ketogenic diet can be difficult for both patients and athletes
and may have undesirable side effects, such as gastro-intestinal
upset (Cai et al., 2017), dyslipidemia (Kwiterovich et al., 2003)
or decreased exercise “efficiency” (Edwards et al., 2011; Burke
et al., 2016). Hence, alternative methods to raise blood ketone
concentrations have been sought to provide the benefits of a
ketogenic diet with no other dietary changes.
An alternative to the ketogenic diet is consumption of drinks
containing exogenous dietary ketones, such as ketone esters (KE)
and ketone salts (KS). The metabolic effects of KS ingestion
have been reported in rats (Ari et al., 2016; Kesl et al., 2016;
Caminhotto et al., 2017), in three extremely ill pediatric patients

(Plecko et al., 2002; Van Hove et al., 2003; Valayannopoulos
et al., 2011) and in cyclists (O’Malley et al., 2017; Rodger
et al., 2017). However, the concentrations of blood βHB reached
were low (<1 mM) and a high amount of salt, consumed
as sodium, potassium and/or calcium βHB, was required to
achieve ketosis. Furthermore, dietary KS are often racemic
mixtures of the two optical isoforms of βHB, D-βHB, and L-
βHB, despite the metabolism of L-βHB being poorly understood
(Webber and Edmond, 1977; Scofield et al., 1982; Lincoln
et al., 1987; Desrochers et al., 1992). The pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of KS ingestion in healthy humans at rest
have not been reported.
Ketone monoester and diester compounds may circumvent
the problems associated with inorganic ion consumption
in KS drinks. KE ingestion rapidly increased blood ketone
concentrations to >5 mM in animals (Desrochers et al., 1995a,b;
Clarke et al., 2012a) and the first oral, non-racemic KE for human
consumption, (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, raised
blood βHB concentrations to 3–5 mM in healthy adults (Clarke
et al., 2012b; Shivva et al., 2016) and athletes (Cox et al., 2016;
Holdsworth et al., 2017; Vandoorne et al., 2017). However,
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this KE with
confounding factors, such as prandial state or multiple KE drinks,
have not been characterized.
Here we investigated the effects of KE and KS consumption
on blood βHB and metabolite concentrations. As we found that
KE ingestion delivered a >50% higher plasma concentrations
of D-βHB alone, we subsequently determined the reliability and
repeatability of ketosis following KE consumption and the effects
of concomitant meal ingestion on blood ketone and substrate
kinetics. Finally, we determined whether nasogastric infusion
could be used for KE administration, given that some patients
require feeding in this manner.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
Firstly, in a randomized four-arm cross-over study, blood
βHB concentrations were compared following ingestion of
equal amounts of βHB as a KE or a KS at two doses by
healthy volunteers at rest (Study 1; n = 15). Secondly, in
a randomized five-arm cross-over study, inter- and intra-
participant repeatability of ketosis was examined following
ingestion of identical KE drinks, twice whilst fed and twice whilst
fasted. As a control, participants also consumed one isocaloric
(1.9 kCal.kg−1) dextrose drink (Study 2; n = 16). Finally, blood
D-βHB was measured after equal amounts of KE were given as
three drinks (n = 12) or a constant nasogastric (NG) infusion
(n = 4) (Study 3; total n = 14) over 9 h.
Participants and Screening
These studies were approved by external Research Ethics
Committees (London Queen’s Square: 14/LO/0288 and South
West Frenchay: 15/SW/0244) and were conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki (2008). Studies took place at the
University of Oxford between September 2014 and September
2016. Participants were healthy, aged 21–57, non-smokers and

had no history of major illness. Female participants were using
oral contraception to minimize the effects of menstrual phase
on results. Participants provided written informed consent
prior to inclusion, and completed a confidential medical
screening questionnaire to determine eligibility. Anthropometric
characteristics are shown in Table 1. Sample sizes were chosen
following an estimated power calculation based on the effect size
in previous work using KE drinks (Clarke et al., 2012b; Shivva
et al., 2016).
General Visit Procedures
Participants refrained from alcohol and caffeine for 24 h prior
to each visit AND were asked to consume a similar meal
the night before each visit. All studies were carried out at
the University of Oxford Human Physiology Laboratories and
started at 0800 h following an overnight (>8 h) fast, with a
minimum of 72 h between visits. Visit order was randomized
prior to commencement by an administrative investigator using
a pseudo-random number generator to produce a list of
combinations of visit order, which were then allocated based on
order of enrolment by a different investigator.
Fasting blood samples were collected prior to all interventions.
Following consumption of study drinks (details below), blood,
expired gas and urine samples were collected at regular intervals
for 4 h. Water was freely permitted and participants remained
sedentary at the test facility throughout the visit. A subset of
participants returned for samples 8 and 24 h after the ketone
drinks (Study 1).
Blood Sampling and Analysis
Venous blood samples (2 ml) were obtained during all visits
using a 22 G catheter inserted percutaneously into an antecubital
vein. The catheter was kept patent using a saline flush following
each sample collection. Additionally, during Study 1, arterialized
blood from a catheter inserted into a heated hand (Forster et al.,
1972) was collected into heparinized blood gas syringes (PICO
100, Radiometer, Copenhagen) from a subset of participants
(n = 7) and immediately analyzed for pH and electrolytes using
a clinical blood gas analyser (ABL, Radiometer, Copenhagen).
D-βHB was measured immediately on whole blood using a
handheld monitor and enzyme-based reagent strips (Precision
Xtra, Abbott Diabetes Care, UK). Samples were stored on ice,
centrifuged and duplicate plasma aliquots stored at −80◦C. All
urine passed during the visit was collected, the total volume
recorded, and 1 ml aliquots taken, frozen and retained for
analysis.

Plasma glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides (TG) and
urinary D-βHB were assayed using a commercial semi-automated
bench-top analyzer (ABX Pentra, Montpellier, France), and
insulin was measured using a commercially available ELISA assay
(Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). Both the pure liquid KS and KE,
and a subset of plasma (n = 5) and urine (n = 10) samples from
a subset of participants in Study 1 underwent analysis using GC-
MS and a chiral column, and the concentrations of L-βHB was
calculated using the enzymatically determined concentration of
D-βHB and the ratio of the D/L-βHB peaks obtained through
GC-MS. Acetoacetate was assayed using an enzymatic method
(Bergmeyer, 1965), and breath acetone was measured using GC-
MS (Study 1) or with a handheld electrochemical device (Study 2;
NTT DOCOMO, Japan) (Toyooka et al., 2013).
Study Protocols
Study 1
Over four visits, participants (n = 15) consumed 1.6 and 3.2
mmol.kg−1 of βHB as KE (141 mg/kg and 282 mg/kg of R-
3-hydroxybutyl-R-1,3-hydroxybutyrate) or as KS (KetoForce,
KetoSports, USA) sodium and potassium βHB, containing 1.6–
3.2 g of each cation), plus 6 g of sweetener containing 19 kCal
(4 g of carbohydrate) (Symrise, Holzminden, Germany), diluted
to 300 ml using water. Drink blinding was not possible due to
unmaskable differences in taste (bitter vs. salty).
Study 2
Over five visits, participants (n = 16) consumed either 4.4
mmol.kg−1 of βHB (2.2 mmol.kg−1 or 395 mg/kg of KE; 1
mole of KE delivered 2 moles of D-βHB equivalents): twice
whilst fasted, and twice following a standardized meal, or an
isocaloric dextrose drink without a meal. To improve palatability,
drinks were diluted to 500 ml with a commercially available,
citrus flavored drink containing 65 kCal (5 g of carbohydrate)
(Glaceau, UK). The dextrose drink was taste-matched using
a bitterness additive (Symrise, Holzminden, Germany). The
standard meal consisted of porridge oats (54 g), semi-skimmed
milk (360 ml) and banana (120 g), giving 600 kCal per person,
with a macronutrient ratio of Carbohydrate: Protein: Fat of 2:1:1.
Study 3
Participants consumed 13.2 mmol.kg−1 of βHB (6.6 mmol.kg−1
or 1,161 mg/kg of KE) over 9 h, either as 3 drinks of 4.4
mmol.kg−1 of βHB at 3 h intervals (n = 12), or as an initial
bolus of 4.4 mmol.kg−1 of βHB given through a nasogastric tube,
followed by an infusion of 1.1 mmol.kg.h−1, beginning 60 min
after the initial bolus, for 8 h (n = 4). Two participants completed
both conditions (total n = 14). In both conditions, the KE was
diluted to 1.5 L using the same citrus water as used in Study 2.
Statistical Methods
For all studies, the area under the curve (AUC) of blood [βHB]
was calculated using the trapezium rule. In Study 3, for each
of the three drinks, the initial rate of D-βHB appearance was
estimated using D-βHB concentrations at baseline and 30 min
post-drink, and D-βHB elimination was estimated using the AUC

between the post-drink peak (60 min) and trough (180 min) D-
βHB concentrations, with a baseline correction to the value at
180 min.
Unless otherwise stated, statistical analysis was conducted
using Prism 6TM software. Values, expressed as means ± SEM,
were considered significantly different at p < 0.05. Initial
tests were undertaken to ensure that normality and sphericity
assumptions were not violated. Subsequently, either one or two
way repeated measures ANOVA, or Freidman’s test with post-
hoc Tukey or Dunnet’s correction were performed, to compare
changing concentrations of substrates, electrolytes, pH, insulin,
breath and urinary βHB: both over time and between study
interventions. In Study 2, data from each of the two study visits in
each condition (fed and fasted) completed by an individual were
included in the analysis.
In Study 2 a Student’s unequal variance t-test with equal SD
was used to compare urine βHB concentrations. Additionally, a
linear mixed effects model was constructed to estimate partitions
of variance in R, using the lme4 and blme packages (Chung
et al., 2013; Bates et al., 2015). Feeding state and visit number
were fixed effects in this model, and inter-participant variability
was a random effect. Inter-participant variability was calculated
according to the adjusted generalized R2 metric (as proposed by
Nakagawa and Schielzeth, 2013), to partition variance between
the fixed effects of feeding, inter-participant variability, and
residual variability. The coefficient of variation for βHB Cmax and
AUC were calculated using the method of Vangel (1996).
RESULTS
Effect of KE and KS Drinks on Blood
Ketone Bodies and Substrates (Study 1)
Blood D-βHB concentrations rapidly increased to a maximum
of 2.8 ± 0.2 mM following the KE drink and to 1.0 ± 0.1 mM
following the KS drink (Figure 1A). After the peak was reached,
blood D-βHB disappearance was non-linear, and followed first
order elimination kinetics as reported previously (Clarke et al.,
2012b; Shivva et al., 2016). D-βHB Tmax was ∼2-fold longer
following KS drinks vs. KE drinks (p < 0.01, Figure 1B), and KS
D-βHB AUC was ∼30–60% lower than the KE drink (p < 0.01,
Figure 1C).
To determine the reason for the differences in blood D-
βHB concentration, the KE and KS drinks were analyzed for
enantiomeric purity. The KE contained >99% of the D-isoform,
whereas ∼50% of the KS βHB was the L-isoform (Figure 1D).
Plasma samples from participants who consumed the high dose
KS drink (n = 5) were analyzed to reveal higher L-βHB than D-
βHB, the total βHB Cmax being 3.4 ± 0.2 mM (Figure 1E), with
a total βHB AUC of 549 ± 19 mmol.min. After 4 h, plasma L-
βHB remained elevated at 1.9 ± 0.2 mM; differences in urinary
excretion of the two isoforms could not explain this observation
as both D- and L-βHB were excreted in proportion to their
blood AUCs (Figure 1F). Therefore, in order to determine the
time required for L-βHB elimination, a follow-up experiment was
undertaken in which subjects (n = 5) consumed 3.2 mmol.kg−1
of βHB as KE and KS with hourly blood and breath sample
collection up to 4 h, plus additional samples at 8 h and 24 h
post-drink. L-βHB was found to be 1.1 ± 0.1 mM at 4 h, and
0.7 ± 0.2 mM after 8 h, but undetectable after 24 h (Figure 1G).
Low amounts of D-βHB (0.3 ± 0.1 mM) were present at 24 h,
presumably due to endogenous production. Both ketone drinks
significantly increased breath acetone concentration, but at a
slower rate than blood D-βHB, reaching a peak after 3 h that was
twice as high following the KE (87 ± 9 ppm) than the KS (44 ± 10
ppm), suggesting that D-βHB was readily converted to acetone,
but L-βHB was not (p < 0.005, Figure 1H).
For subjects completing the initial experiment (n = 15), the
amount of D-βHB excreted in the urine increased with D-βHB
intake, but was <1.5% of the total βHB ingested and was not
different between matched doses of KE vs. KS (Figure 1I). There
was no change in urine volume produced in different study
conditions. Baseline urinary pH (5.7 ± 0.1) was unchanged by KE
ingestion (pH 6.4 ± 0.2. p = 0.8 vs. baseline) but was significantly
alkalinized by KS consumption (pH 8.5 ± 0.1. p < 0.001 vs.
baseline) (Figure 1J).
Although decreases in FFA, TG and glucose occurred, there
were no significant differences between the KE and KS drinks
or with intake amount. Ingestion of ketone drinks significantly
decreased overall mean plasma FFA from 0.7 to 0.4 mM, TG
from 1.1 to 0.9 mM and glucose from 5.7 to 4.8 mM after 1 h
(all p < 0.05). Concentrations were the same as at baseline by
4 h, with FFA at 0.6 mM, TG at 0.9 mM and glucose 5.1 mM
(Figures 2A–C). There was a rise in insulin concentrations
30 min following all drinks, probably due to the small amount
of carbohydrate in the sweetener (Figure 2D).
In a subset of participants (n = 7) the effect of 3.2 mmol.kg−1
of βHB as KE and KS on blood pH and electrolytes after ketone
drinks was investigated. Blood D-βHB kinetics were similar to
those in the initial experiment (Figure 3A). After 60 min, blood
pH declined from 7.41 to 7.31 following a KE drink (p < 0.001,
Figure 3B). Bicarbonate fell significantly from 23.6 ± 0.7 to 17.0
± 0.8 mM following KE drinks (p < 0.001), but remained within
the normal range (Figure 3C). Both ketone drinks significantly
decreased blood potassium concentrations by 0.7 mM (both
drinks p < 0.05, Figure 3D) and increased sodium and chloride
concentrations (Sodium: both drinks p < 0.05, Chloride: KE = p
< 0.05, KS = p < 0.005, Figures 3E,F).
Effect of Meal Consumption on Blood
D-βHB, Repeatability of Ketone Kinetics
and Substrate Changes Following KE
Drinks (Study 2)
A meal high in carbohydrate and calories significantly decreased
peak D-βHB by ∼ 1 mM (Figure 4A) and reduced the D-
βHB AUC by 27% (p < 0.001, Figure 4B). There were no
significant changes in D-βHB Tmax (fed = 73 ± 6 min vs.
fasted 66 ± 4 min). Despite the differences in D-βHB kinetics
after the meal, there were no effects of food on urinary
ketone excretion (Figure 4C), plasma AcAc (Figure 4D) or
breath acetone (Figure 4E) following KE ingestion. Plasma
AcAc kinetics followed a similar time course to D-βHB, with
the ratio of blood D-βHB: AcAc being 6:1 when KE drinks
were consumed whilst fasted, and 4:1 following the meal.
As observed in Study 1, breath acetone concentrations rose

more slowly than blood ketone concentrations, reaching a
plateau at 150 min and remaining elevated for at least 4 h
(Figure 4E).
The concentrations of blood D-βHB after KE drinks were
highly repeatable whether consumed whilst fasted or fed
(Figures 4F,G). The D-βHB Cmax values ranged from 1.3 to
3.5 mM when fed and 2.3 to 4.7 mM when fasted. There was
no significant effect of visit order on D-βHB kinetics, with the
maximal difference in D-βHB Cmax reached by one individual
being 1.2 mM when fed and 1.9 mM when fasted. Approximately

61% of the variation in the data was attributable to feeding (fed
vs. fasted), <1% to visit order, 16% to inter-participant variability,
and the residual 24% variability due to non-specific random
effects.
KE consumption decreased FFA from 0.6 to 0.2 mM, TG from
1.0 to 0.8 mM, and glucose from 5.5 to 4.7 mM by the end of the
study (4 h). The effect was not altered by a meal (Figures 5A–C).
Dextrose drinks also lowered FFA from 0.6 to 0.2 mM and TG
from 1.0 to 0.7 mM (Figures 5A, B). This was likely mediated by
the transient increase in glucose, which rose from 4.6 to 6.5 mM
following the dextrose drink (Figure 5C). The anti-lypoytic effect
of dextrose drinks was shorter than that of KE drinks as D-βHB
concentrations were elevated for longer after KE drinks than
glucose after dextrose drinks . Insulin increased to ∼ 35 mU.ml−1
after both the meal and the dextrose drink, but also increased to
13 ± 2 mU.ml−1 when KE was consumed whilst fasted owing
to the 15 g of glucose in the flavored drink used as a diluent
(Figure 5D).
Effect of Existing Exogenous Ketosis on
KE Uptake and Elimination (Study 3)
Serial drinks or a continuous NG infusion of KE effectively
kept blood ketone concentrations >1 mM for 9 h (Figure 6).
With drinks every 3 h, blood D-βHB rose and then fell, but
had not returned to baseline (∼ 0.1 mM) when the next drink
was consumed. There was no significant difference in D-βHB
Cmax between drinks 2 and 3 (3.4 ± 0.2 mM vs. 3.8 ± 0.2 mM
p = 0.3), as the rate of D-βHB appearance fell slightly with
successive drinks (0.07 ± 0.01 mmol.min−1 and 0.06 ± 0.01
mmol.min−1 p = 0.6). D-βHB elimination was the same after
each bolus (142 ± 37 mmol.min, 127 ± 45 mmol.min; and 122
± 54 mmol.min). When KE was given via a nasogastric tube,
the initial bolus raised blood D-βHB to 2.9 ± 0.5 mM after 1 h,
thereafter continuous infusion maintained blood D-βHB between
2–3 mM. Total D-βHB appearance in the blood was identical for
both methods of administration (Serial drinks AUC: 1,394 ± 64
mmol.min; NG infusion AUC: 1,305 ± 143 mmol.min. p = 0.6).
DISCUSSION
Main Findings
Exogenous ketones drinks are growing in popularity as a method
to elevate blood ketone concentrations and mimic a ketogenic
diet without the need for dietary changes (Ari et al., 2016; Cox
et al., 2016; Kesl et al., 2016; Caminhotto et al., 2017; Evans
et al., 2017). The present study describes the pharmacokinetic

drinks in humans at rest, and characterizes the effects of a
prior meal, which is pertinent to use as a dietary supplement.
The main findings were that KE drinks elevated blood D-
βHB > 50% higher than KS drinks, the latter significantly
increasing blood L-βHB, which was metabolized more slowly by
the body. Both drinks had similar effects on FFA, TG, glucose
and electrolyte concentrations, although with disparate effects
on pH. A prior meal decreased total blood D-βHB appearance
after a KE drink. Finally, either three KE drinks or nasogastric
feeding effectively maintained nutritional ketosis over 1 mM
for 9 h.
Comparative Effects of Ketone Ester and
Salt Drinks
The difference in peak blood D-βHB concentrations between
matched amounts of βHB as ester or salts arose because the
salt contained L-βHB, as the blood concentrations of D- plus L-
βHB isoforms were similar for both compounds. It is unclear
if kinetic parameters of KE and KS drinks would be similar
if matched D-βHB were taken in the drinks. Unlike D-βHB,
blood L-βHB remained elevated for at least 8 h following the
drink, suggesting an overall lower rate of metabolism of L-
βHB as urinary elimination of L-βHB was in proportion to
plasma concentration. Despite similar concentrations of total

βHB, breath acetone was ∼50% lower following KS drinks
compared to KE, suggesting fundamental differences in the
metabolic fates of D- and L-βHB. These findings support both
previous hypotheses (Veech and King, 2016) and experimental
work in rats (Webber and Edmond, 1977), which suggested that
the L-isoform was less readily oxidized than the D-isoform, and
is processed via different pathways, perhaps in different cellular
compartments. It seems that L-βHB is not a major oxidative fuel
at rest, and may accumulate with repeated KS drinks. However,
the putative signaling role of L-βHB in humans remains unclear.
In rodent cardiomyocytes, L-βHB acts as a signal that modulates
the metabolism of D-βHB and glucose, Tsai et al. (2006) although
no differences in blood glucose were seen here. Furthermore, L-
βHB can act as a cellular antioxidant, although to a lesser extent
than D-βHB (Haces et al., 2008).
The effects of the two exogenous ketone drinks on acid-base
balance and blood pH were disparate. In solution the ketone
salt fully dissociates (giving a total of 3.2–6.4 g of inorganic
cation per drink), allowing βHB− to act as a conjugate base,
mildly raising blood and urine pH, as seen during salt IV

infusions (Balasse and Ooms, 1968; Balasse, 1979). Urinary
pH increased with the salts as the kidneys excreted the excess
cations. In contrast, KE hydrolysis in the gut provides βHB− with
butanediol, which subsequently underwent hepatic metabolism
to form the complete keto-acid, thus briefly lowering blood
pH to 7.31. Electrolyte shifts were similar for both KE and KS
drinks and may have occurred due to βHB− metabolism, causing
cellular potassium influx and sodium efflux (Palmer, 2015).
Ketone Ester Pharmacokinetics
As

higher
D-βHB
concentrations than KS, we investigated factors that may
be important in the use of ketone drinks to achieve nutritional
ketosis. Initially we determined the repeatability of blood
ketosis following KE drinks and found little variation in kinetic
parameters between individuals. Variability between participants
was less than within the population, and accurate individual
prediction of the D-βHB Cmax following a body-weight adjusted
KE drink was achieved. Variability within individuals was likely
due to normal daily changes in GI function, including gastric
emptying, portal blood flow or intestinal transit time, which may
alter KE hydrolysis and absorption.
As ketone drinks can deliver nutritional ketosis without
fasting, we investigated the effect of food on KE uptake and
metabolism. It is well documented that food in the gut can slow,
or prevent, the uptake of small hydrophilic hydrocarbons, such as
βHB (Melander, 1978; Toothaker and Welling, 1980; Horowitz
et al., 1989; Fraser et al., 1995), so decreased gut βHB uptake

is probably the cause of lower blood βHB following the meal.
Despite higher blood βHB concentrations in the fasted state, the
meal did not alter plasma AcAc. This suggests that the rate of
conversion of βHB to AcAc may not match the rate of appearance
of βHB following KE consumption. Alternatively, meal-induced
changes in the hepatic ratio of NAD+:NADH may have altered
the conversion of βHB to AcAc (Himwich et al., 1937; Desrochers
et al., 1992).
As repeated KE consumption would be required to maintain
nutritional ketosis, we investigated the kinetics of drinks in series
and of continuous intra-gastric infusion. During starvation, the
accumulation of ketones (>4 mM) reportedly inhibited ketone
clearance from the blood, however the underlying mechanism is
unknown (Hall et al., 1984; Wastney et al., 1984; Balasse and Fery,
1989). In Study 3, βHB uptake and elimination were identical for
the second and third KE drinks, suggesting that βHB may have
reached a pseudo-steady state should further identical boluses
have been given at similar intervals. Furthermore, when the
KE was given at a constant rate via a NG tube, blood ketone
concentrations remained ∼3 mM. Therefore, repeated KE drinks
effectively maintain ketosis at the intervals and doses studied
here.
Effects of Exogenous Ketones on Blood
Glucose, Lipids and Insulin
The metabolic phenotype of endogenous ketosis is characterized
by lowered blood glucose and elevated FFA concentrations,
whereas both blood glucose and FFA are lowered in exogenous
ketosis. During endogenous ketosis, low insulin and elevated
cortisol increase adipose tissue lipolysis, with hepatic FFA
supply being a key determinant of ketogenesis. Ketone bodies
exert negative feedback on their own production by reducing
hepatic FFA supply through βHB-mediated agonism of the
PUMA-G receptor in adipose tissue, which suppresses lipolysis
(Taggart et al., 2005). Exogenous ketones from either intravenous
infusions (Balasse and Ooms, 1968; Mikkelsen et al., 2015) or
ketone drinks, as studied here, inhibit adipose tissue lipolysis by
the same mechanism, making the co-existence of low FFA and
high βHB unique to exogenous ketosis.
Blood glucose concentrations are decreased during both
exogenous and endogenous ketosis, although by different
mechanisms. During endogenous ketosis, dietary carbohydrate
deficit is the underlying cause of low blood glucose, along
with reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis and increased ketone
production (Cahill et al., 1966). With exogenous ketosis,
carbohydrate stores are plentiful, yet ketones appear to lower
blood glucose through limiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and
increasing peripheral glucose uptake (Mikkelsen et al., 2015).
One clinical use of the ketogenic diet is to improve blood glucose
control, yet the elevated blood FFA may increase the risk of heart
failure (Holloway et al., 2009). Thus, the ability of exogenous
ketones to lower blood glucose without elevating blood FFA
concentrations could deliver the desired effect of the diet, whilst
also decreasing a potential risk.
Interestingly, the effects of exogenous ketones on blood
substrate concentrations were preserved with the metabolic
stimulus of a mixed meal. Following KE drinks, FFA and glucose
fell and remained low in both fed and fasted subjects, despite
higher insulin throughout the fed arm, suggesting that there was
no synergistic effect of insulin and βHB to further lower blood
glucose or FFA. In agreement with previous work, the threshold
for the effects of βHB on glucose and lipids appears to be low
(<1 mM), as there was no significant dose-response relationship
between increasing blood βHB and the small changes in plasma
FFA, TG or glucose across all of the study drinks (Mikkelsen et al.,
2015).
The effects of ketone drinks on endogenous insulin secretion
are unclear. Whilst the small increase in plasma insulin after
KE and KS drinks may have been due to the small quantity of
dextrose in the diluent, it has been proposed that ketones could
potentiate or even stimulate insulin secretion. Isolated pancreatic
islets secreted insulin when stimulated by ketones at glucose
concentrations of >5 mM (Biden and Taylor, 1983), and small
amounts of insulin are secreted in vivo following exposure to
exogenous ketones in animals (Madison et al., 1964; Miles et al.,
1981). In response to an intra-venous 10 mM glucose clamp,
ketone ester drinks increased glucose uptake and plasma insulin
(Holdsworth et al., 2017). The increases in insulin with ketone
drinks taken whilst fasted were small compared to the increases
seen when the ketone ester drink was consumed with a meal
and with consumption of a dextrose drink. Furthermore, the
lack of difference in peak plasma insulin between the two latter
conditions indicates that nutritional ketosis did not inhibit or
increase normal carbohydrate induced insulin production.
Monitoring Exogenous Ketosis
Given that blood βHB after identical ketone drinks can be
affected by factors such as food or exercise (Cox et al., 2016),
the accuracy of tools for non-invasive monitoring of ketosis
should be investigated. Breath acetone and urinary ketone
measurements provide methods to approximate blood ketosis
without repeated blood sampling (Martin and Wick, 1943;
Taboulet et al., 2007). However, breath acetone did not change
as rapidly as blood βHB following KE and KS drinks. Acetone
is a fat-soluble molecule, so may have been sequestered into
lipids before being slowly released, resulting in the differences
observed here. Similarly, significant differences in blood D-βHB
between study conditions were not reflected in the urinary D-
βHB elimination. As the amount of D-βHB excreted in the urine
(≈0.1–0.5 g) represented ∼1.5% of the total consumed (≈23.7 g),
it appears that the major fate of exogenous D-βHB was oxidation
in peripheral tissues. These results suggest that neither breath
acetone nor urinary ketone measurements accurately reflect
the rapid changes in blood ketone concentrations after ketone
drinks, and that blood measurement should be the preferred
method to quantitatively describe ketosis. That said, it should be
noted that although commercial handheld monitors are the most
practical and widely available tool for measuring blood ketones,
they can overestimate blood D-βHB compared to laboratory
measures (Guimont et al., 2015) and these monitors do not
measure L-βHB and so may not provide accurate total blood
ketone concentrations, especially if a racemic ketone salt has been
consumed.

Exogenous Ketone Metabolism
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, drinks containing exogenous ketones, in either
ester or salt form, can raise concentrations of blood βHB in
humans, although elevation of L-βHB lasts longer after racemic
KS consumption. Both KE and KS drinks mildly altered acid-
base balance. Exogenous ketones lowered blood glucose and
lipids without inhibiting endogenous insulin secretion. The
KE delivered highly repeatable blood concentrations of D-
βHB, although ketosis was decreased by a meal. Uptake and
elimination of D-βHB were similar when several drinks were
consumed in succession. The dietary KE could maintain ketosis
using drinks taken regularly around a normal meal pattern, or
using a continuous infusion via a nasogastric tube. Therefore,
ketone drinks are a viable and practical alternative to dietary
strategies to achieve ketosis.
