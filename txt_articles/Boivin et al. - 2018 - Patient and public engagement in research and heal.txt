Abstract
Background: Patient and public engagement is growing, but evaluative efforts re-
main limited. Reviews looking at evaluation tools for patient engagement in individual 
decision making do exist, but no similar articles in research and health systems have 
been published.
Objective: Systematically review and appraise evaluation tools for patient and public 
engagement in research and health system decision making.
Methods: We searched literature published between January 1980 and February 
2016. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews, CINAHL and PsycINFO) were consulted, as well as grey litera-
ture obtained through Google, subject- 
matter experts, social media and engagement 
organization websites. Two independent reviewers appraised the evaluation tools 
based on 4 assessment criteria: scientific rigour, patient and public perspective, com-
prehensiveness and usability.
Results: In total, 10 663 unique references were identified, 27 were included. Most 
of these tools were developed in the last decade and were designed to support im-
provement of engagement activities. Only 11% of tools were explicitly based on a 
literature review, and just 7% were tested for reliability. Patients and members of the 
public were involved in designing 56% of the tools, mainly in the piloting stage, and 
18.5% of tools were designed to report evaluation results to patients and the 
public.
Conclusion: A growing number of evaluation tools are available to support patient 
and public engagement in research and health system decision making. However, the 
scientific rigour with which such evaluation tools are developed could be improved, 
as well as the level of patient and public engagement in their design and reporting.

1 | INTRODUCTION
In the past decade, there have been rapid developments in patient 
and public engagement1,2 as illustrated by a tenfold increase in 
the number of articles published annually on the subject.3 As the 
commitment to patient and public engagement has grown, so too 
has the call for robust evaluations.4,5 Without adequate evaluation 
tools in place, it is difficult to ensure the integrity of engagement 
principles and practices, assess the outcomes of engagement, learn 
from current practices and demonstrate accountability for public 
investments.
Evaluative efforts on patient and public engagement have ex-
panded recently, with the development of evaluation principles 
and frameworks4,6-10 and an increasing number of published eval-
uations.6,11-20 The development of structured evaluation tools has 
been slower, and mostly performed through unpublished, project- 
specific instruments, thus limiting the potential for comparison 
and mutual learning across engagement projects. Systematic re-
views of evaluation instruments have been conducted for patient 
engagement in individual health- 
care decision making,21-23 but 
need to be expanded to other domains of patient engagement, 
including research and health system decision making.
2 | OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to systematically review and appraise ex-
isting evaluation instruments for patient and public engagement in 
research and health system decision making.
This work was conducted as part of the Canadian Strategy for 
Patient- 
Oriented Research (SPOR), which promotes patient engage-
ment in research and health system transformation, hence our focus 
on these 2 engagement domains.24 As part of the SPOR strategy, 
methodological SUPPORT Units (Support for People and Patient- 
Oriented Research and Trials) in each province are mandated with 
strengthening patient and public engagement. We also conducted 
a systematic assessment of identified evaluation tool to charac-
terize their main strengths and weaknesses, guide engagement 
practitioners’ choice of specific instruments and orient the future 
development of such tools.
3 | METHODS
3.1 | Definitions and scope
This systematic review was based on CIHR’s definition of “patient 
engagement” as a meaningful and active collaboration in the govern-
ance, priority setting, and conduct of research, as well as in knowl-
edge translation.24 The “public” includes any “people who bring the 
collective voice of specific, affected communities.”24 “Evaluation” 
refers to “the systematic acquisition and assessment of information 
to provide useful feedback about some object.”25 Within the context 
of this systematic review, evaluations could focus on the context, 
process or impacts of patient and public engagement.6 “Evaluation 
tool” refers to any instrument that can help to systematically acquire 
and assess information about patient and public engagement activi-
ties. This may include questionnaires, scales, interview guides or ob-
servation grids for use by engagement participants, organizational 
sponsors or external evaluators.
3.2 | Review method
We chose a critical interpretive synthesis method to guide our re-
view. Critical interpretive synthesis allows for the conceptual trans-
lation of quantitative and qualitative studies, as well as non- 
empirical 
papers.26 This approach is particularly well suited to the synthesis of 
diverse types of literature, such as quantitative and qualitative, pub-
lished and grey, and health and social sciences, for which the phe-
nomena of interest, populations, interventions and outcomes vary 
and may not be well- 
defined.
3.3 | Search strategy
We searched for literature published between January 1980 and 
February 2016 in the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane database 
of systematic reviews, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases, without 
any language restrictions. An information specialist was consulted 
to help develop, update and execute specific search strategies and 
bibliographic queries for each database (Table 1).
Five additional strategies were used to complement the elec-
tronic database search: (i) contacting authors of published evaluation 
reports; (ii) hand- 
searching bibliographies from retrieved articles;

(iii) searching for unpublished evaluation tools in Google, Google 
Scholar and the websites of select Canadian and international orga-
nizations (eg, the Patient Engagement Resource Hub of the Canadian 
Foundation for Healthcare Improvement and the INVOLVE library in 
the United Kingdom); (iv) soliciting recommendations from Canadian 
and international experts and networks; and (v) soliciting the input 
of a larger audience through social media.
3.4 | Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included original and review articles on evaluations of patient 
and public engagement in research and health system decision mak-
ing that included evaluation tools, and background papers offering 
critical discussions of key evaluation tools that pertain to patient and 
public engagement in research and health system decision making.
Documents were excluded if they focused strictly on patient and 
public communication; patient engagement in individual health- 
care 
decisions; mechanisms to engage patients and the public as research 
subjects; theoretical and/or conceptual frameworks that were not 
linked to an evaluation tool; and evaluation tools not used in the con-
text of research and health system decision making.
3.5 | Data extraction
All search results were transferred to a reference database and du-
plicates were removed. The titles and abstracts were screened by 2 
members of the research team before retrieving the full- 
text versions 
of the references included. Discrepancies between reviewers were 
resolved by consensus. In total, 4 reviewers were involved in the in-
clusion process, and 1 reviewed all citations, abstracts and articles.
Two research team members independently reviewed and 
summarized the peer- 
reviewed articles and grey literature using 
a standardized extraction sheet, compiling the following informa-
tion: authors; year of publication; main stated purpose; and the 
name, dimensions and domains, development procedure, theo-
retical/conceptual foundation and psychometric properties of the 
evaluation tool. Tool developers who did not publish the tools but 
only the process or use of their tool were contacted.
3.6 | Tool assessment
Assessment criteria were developed in collaboration with the evalu-
ation tools’ intended users. Each evaluation tool was assessed based 
on 4 criteria:
1. Scientific rigour: Was the development of the evaluation tool 
scientifically rigourous and based on existing evidence on 
patient and public engagement (eg, based on a literature re-
view in at least 2 databases, assessed for reliability and 
validity)?
2. Patient and public perspective: Does the evaluation tool take into 
account the views of patients and the public (both in its develop-
ment, use and reporting)?
3. Comprehensiveness: Is the tool comprehensive in evaluating the 
context, process, outcomes and impacts of patient and public 
engagement?
4. Usability: Is the evaluation tool easy to use (eg, availability and 
readability level)?
Two members of the research team independently appraised the 
evaluation tools using the assessment grid and its 5- 
point rating sys-
tem. (See Data S1 for the complete assessment grid.) The evaluation 
tools’ readability level was assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease 
test (score of 70 or more, or 7th- 
grade level).
3.7 | Integrated knowledge translation
Evaluation tool users, including patients and members of the public 
with engagement experience, were involved in all stages of the pro-
ject, using an integrated knowledge translation approach.27 One pa-
tient partner was involved in the research team and participated in 
study design, governance, interpretation and knowledge translation. A 
steering committee composed of representatives from all sponsoring 
SUPPORT Units (including patient and public engagement practition-
ers) met 6 times during the project to review the design, assessment 
criteria, preliminary findings and knowledge translation strategy. A 
1- 
day face- 
to- 
face consensus meeting was held mid- 
project to re-
view preliminary findings, discuss assessment criteria and develop the 
knowledge translation strategy. Thirty- 
one people participated in the 
consensus meeting, half of whom were patients and members of the 
public with engagement experience, along with researchers, patient 
engagement practitioners and representatives from national research 
and health- 
care organizations (see Acknowledgement section). An 
open- 
access online evaluation toolkit (www.ceppp.ca/en/our-projects/

tools was published upon project completion to facilitate dissemination 
and uptake. End users’ engagement modified the evaluation criteria (eg, 
adding a focus on usability) and dissemination strategy (eg, open- 
access 
online dissemination).
4 | RESULTS
After removing duplicates, 10 663 unique references were identified 
and 648 full- 
text articles were reviewed (Figure 1). Forty potential 
evaluation tools were identified. Thirteen of those were excluded 
because they were not specific to patient and public engagement 
(n = 9), did not relate to research and health system decision mak-
ing (n = 1) or did not actually include an evaluation tool (n = 3). Few 
evaluation tools’ developers responded to requests for additional 
information and unpublished tools.
4.1 | Description of evaluation tools
Twenty- 
seven patient and public engagement evaluation tools met 
the inclusion criteria (full references for those included are found in 
Table S1). Of the tools included, 14 are specific to research, 11 focus 
on health system decision making and 2 can be applied to both do-
mains. All of the tools were published in English and the majority of 
them (85%) were developed after 2005. Most were developed in the 
United Kingdom (n = 10), Canada (n = 8) and the United States (n = 7). 
Self- 
administered questionnaires and surveys were the most com-
mon type of tool identified (n = 15). T 
he stated purpose behind 
most of the tools was the improvement of patient and public engage-
ment activities. Table 2 describes the included evaluation tools.
4.2 | Assessment of the tools
Table 3 provides a summary of the evaluation tools’ scores for 
each of the 4 assessment domains. Assessment scores for each 
individual assessment criteria are included in Supplementary 
Document 3.
On average, the evaluation tools scored lowest in the scientific 
rigour domain. The tools were mostly developed based on stakeholder 
expertise and experience. Only a small number of tools (11.1%) were 
informed by a review of literature on patient and public engagement in 
at least 2 databases and 63% were grounded in a specific theoretical 
or conceptual framework. Reliability testing was rare (7.4% of tools).
Patients and members of the public were involved in the tools’ 
development more than half the time (59%), but mostly in the piloting 
stage. Most tools (74.1%) were designed to collect information from 
patients and the public. However, very few instruments measured 
the perspectives of patients or members of the public in relation to 
those of their engagement partners (eg, researchers, clinicians and 
managers). Only 18.5% of tools were explicitly designed with the ob-
jective of reporting back evaluation results to patients and the public.
Five of the tools covered all assessment criteria for comprehen-
siveness: 2 covering health system decision making and 3 covering 
research. The outcomes of patient and public engagement were 
least often evaluated (55.6% of tools), in contrast with the engage-
ment process (74.1%) and context (81.5%). For those tools seeking to 
evaluate the outcomes of patient and public engagement, the most 
common focus was on perceived, self- 
reported impacts, as opposed 
to observed impacts by external evaluators.
Two of the tools covered all assessment criteria for usability. 
All tools described the purpose of the instrument, and the majority 
(74.1%) were available free of charge. The most important usability 
issue identified related to readability, with only 11.1% of tools re-
quiring a 7th- 
grade or lower reading level.

evaluation tools for engagement in research and health system deci-
sion making, most of which were developed in the last decade. These 
findings suggest that engagement evaluation activity is increasing 
around the globe and provide an important basis for future evalu-
ation work.
One of this review major contributions is that it not only identi-
fies existing evaluation tools for patient and public engagement, but 
it also systematically assesses their main strengths, weaknesses and 
characteristics using predetermined criteria codeveloped with key 
stakeholders, thus complementing related work in the area.28 The 
goal of our assessment grid was not to provide an overall quality 
score, but aimed to guide user’s selection of tools to fit their own 
evaluation needs. As such, our assessment grid cannot be used to 
“rank” evaluation tools or to identify the “best” tool, but helps iden-
tify the strengths and weaknesses of each.
A number of potential weaknesses were identified regarding 
evaluation tools’ development process. First, scientifically rigorous 
methods must be used to develop evaluation tools, including more 
frequent psychometric testing and validation studies.29 The fact that 
only a small number (11%) of instruments are informed by a literature 
review in at least 2 databases is disconcerting, pointing to a potential 
duplication of effort (new tools being created because existing ones 
are unknown) and misalignment with key dimensions of engage-
ment documented in the scientific literature. Secondly, efforts must 
be made to address the lack of an explicit conceptual framework 
in most tools, which is significant given the importance of linking 
empirical evaluation with an explicit theoretical foundation.6,30,31 
Lastly, the high level of literacy required to understand most in-
struments should be addressed, particularly because patients and 
members of the public are the target users of most evaluation tools 
and because engagement with vulnerable populations is a frequent 
concern.32
In line with the ethos of participation, key stakeholders are often 
engaged in the development of evaluation tools for engagement. 
However, the involvement of patients and the public has largely 
been limited to the data collection stage and rarely extended to 
the design of evaluation instruments or the reporting of evaluation 
results.
The predominance of context and process evaluation instru-
ments is surprising, given the frequent calls for greater evaluation of 
the impact of engagement outcomes.33 Evaluating the context and 
process of engagement is consistent with the objective of develop-
mental and formative evaluation as a means of improving engage-
ment practices.7,12,34,35 The number of evaluation tools measuring 
“perceived self- 
reported impacts” as the main measure for outcomes 
suggests a need for new evaluation tools based on observable 
impacts.36
5.1 | Strengths and limitations of the review
The main strengths of this review are its comprehensive search strat-
egy and rigorous appraisal of existing tools based on predetermined 
criteria codeveloped with a broad group of evaluation users. To limit 
the possibility of omitting relevant material, the search strategy was 
adapted for each type of database with an information specialist.
Two specific issues may have limited our ability to identify all 
relevant tools. First, the poor indexing of evaluation tools in some 
search engines may have contributed to the relatively low number of 
tools identified. In a further update of this review, additional search 
engines could be considered to identify additional material. Second, 
the fact that practitioners rarely publish their evaluation tools—
often because of space limitations and journal editors’ publication 
policies—may also have limited the identification of relevant tools. 
Many tools have been developed for a single project or for internal 
use by organizations without being made publicly available. These 
limitations could be addressed through broader use of publication 
reporting guidelines for patient and public engagement research.14,37 
Evaluators and journal editors should pay special attention to pub-
lishing evaluation instruments, and properly index them to facilitate 
the development and use of common instruments across studies.

Furthermore, a number of assessment criteria could not be fully 
assessed due to a lack of published information. It is possible that 
certain assessment criteria were applied but not reported by tools’ 
developers (eg, literature review was performed but not reported), 
thus reducing the assessment score of the tool. The readability level 
of about a third of the tools could not be assessed because the com-
plete tool was unavailable.
5.2 | Implications for practice and research
Patient and public engagement practitioners have access to a broad set 
of evaluation tools, most of which have been designed to help improve 
the quality of engagement activities. When developing new instru-
ments or refining existing evaluation tools, particular attention should 
be given to literature review; alignment with engagement frameworks 
and theories; readability; impact assessment; psychometric testing; 
and involvement of patients and the public in evaluation design and 
reporting.
Most tools identified are targeted instruments evaluating a 
precise dimension of patient and public engagement, usually con-
centrating on context, process and perceived self- 
reported impact. 
Future developments could complement existing instruments with 
more comprehensive evaluation tools that can be used across mul-
tiple projects, with evaluation tools’ using a dyadic approach to data 
collection (eg, assessing engagement from the perspective of pa-
tients and their research partners), as well as instruments measuring 
observable engagement impacts by external evaluators.
The tools identified in this review were assembled and disseminated 
by means of an open- 
access repository of evaluation instruments (www.
ceppp.ca/en/our-projects/evaluation-toolkit/), thus strengthening en-
gagement practitioners’ capacity for evaluation and reducing duplica-
tion of efforts when appropriate instruments already exist. Given the

rapid growth of the engagement evaluation field, it is possible that rel-
evant evaluation tools are under development or that existing tools are 
being refined: an update of this review is recommended in a few years.
6 | CONCLUSION
A growing set of tools is available for the evaluation of patient and 
public engagement in research and health system decision making. 
Knowledge of the tools’ specific strengths and weaknesses can guide 
practitioners in choosing an appropriate instrument for their evalua-
tion needs. Practitioners developing new tools should place greater 
emphasis on scientific rigour, the involvement of patients and the 
public in evaluation design and reporting, and the readability of 
evaluation instruments. The identification, appraisal and dissemina-
tion of existing evaluation tools in an open- 
access online repository 
constitute an important contribution of this review in strengthening 
collective capacity for evaluating patient and public engagement.
