Abstract
Purpose—Visual impairment presents significant risks for occupational injuries among 
farmworkers, vulnerable population with limited access to vision care. While previous research 
has noted farmworkers’ low lifetime experience with vision screening and high rates of complaints 
of eye ailments and poor vision, there have been few screening data collected to evaluate these 
self-reports. The objectives of this analysis are to (1) describe farmworker visual health using 
standardized visual acuity screening data and self-reported visual function, and (2) to compare the 
screening and self-report data.
Methods—Data are from a cross-sectional study of eye health among Latino migrant 
farmworkers in North Carolina with uncorrected vision (n=289). Workers were recruited using 
methods to achieve a representative sample of a hard-to-reach population. Visual acuity data were 
collected using Snellen Tumbling E charts for nearsightedness and farsightedness. Binocular data 
are reported here. Interviews were conducted to obtain personal characteristics and self-assessed 
visual function.
Results—About 75% of farmworkers reported never having had a vision screening. Based on 
binocular screening, 1.7% (distance vision) and 6.9% (near vision) had moderate to severe visual 
impairment (>20/40). Farmworkers self-reported poorer visual function, compared with screening 
results; only 36.4% reported good or very good vision. Sensitivity of distance and near vision self-
reports were 60% and 20%, respectively, but specificity was high.
Conclusions—This study confirms past reports of little vision screening among farmworkers. 
Visual impairment for distance is comparable to other studies of Latinos in the US, though these 
studies have not reported near vision. Self-reports of vision problems are not a sensitive measure 
of visual acuity among farmworkers. Screening is needed to identify visual impairment that can 
create occupational safety risks in this health disparate population.

Migrant farmworkers are exposed to a variety of environmental risk factors including 
chemicals, mechanical devices, plants, crops, dust, and exposure to sunlight that can result in 
occupational eye injuries and illnesses.1,2,3 Visual impairment has the potential to increase 
the risk of occupational injuries in farmworkers. Workers rely on distance vision when 
driving vehicles or operating farm equipment. They rely on near vision to avoid branches or 
other hazards when picking crops and to see hazard symbols on pesticide labels and posted 
warnings. Environmental conditions in the workplace such as inadequate lighting or sunlight 
glare may compound a farmworker’s poor vision, resulting in higher risks for falls or other 
accidents while performing daily tasks.4,5 While the risks of injury resulting from visual 
impairment are significant for workers in many occupations, the farmworker population is of 
particular interest because this industry sector has fewer safety regulations than other 
industries.6,7 Weaker occupational safety and health regulations in combination with visual 
impairment among this population may significantly enhance the risk of injury.
The majority of migrant farmworkers in the United States are Latino.7 Latinos are more 
likely than other groups in the US to suffer from visual impairment.8 In addition, Latinos 
have high rates of age-related illnesses including hypertension, type II diabetes, and 
pterygium, all of which increase the risk for visual impairment.8,9 Although visual 
impairment is acknowledged among the general Latino population,10 documentation among 
Latino migrant farmworkers is scarce.
Existing studies have relied on self-reported information to measure visual impairment 
among farmworkers.11,12,13 A study in North Carolina found that 22% of farmworkers 
reported fair or poor eyesight, and up to 20% reported difficulty seeing in specific situations 
(i.e., recognizing a friend across the street, conducting specific tasks that require near 
vision).11 Although such self-reported data have been used to document the prevalence of 
perceived visual impairment among farmworkers, they have not been compared to standard 
assessments of refractive error using standardized eye chart protocols. A survey of providers 
from migrant health clinics who administered visual screening tests using an eye chart found 
that refractive error was a common eye problem in migrant farmworkers.13 While the results 
of visual screening tests in migrant health clinics might shed some light on vision problems, 
few farmworkers use healthcare in the US except when injured or experiencing significant 
illness, due to their immigration status, low income, lack of health insurance, and the limited 
number of migrant health facilities.14,15 Therefore, there is a need to conduct vision 
screening among the general farmworker population to assess the prevalence of impaired 
vision as well as a need to compare self-reported vision with more objective screening 
measures. Understanding the prevalence of visual impairment as well as the association of 
self-report and screening measures can help clinicians prioritize the need for visual 
screenings in this at-risk population.

farmworkers with uncorrected vision by gathering data at farmworker residential sites. The

 objectives of this analysis are (1) to describe farmworker visual function using self-report 
and standardized visual acuity screening data, and (2) to compare the self-report and 
screening data. Analyses are restricted to workers not currently using corrective lenses in 
order to describe the burden of uncorrected visual impairment in these workers.
METHODS
Data are from a cross-sectional study of self-reported visual impairment and a standardized 
screening for visual acuity administered among migrant Latino farmworkers in eastern 
North Carolina. Data collection was completed from June through August, 2009.
Sample
Participant recruitment and selection has been described previously.16 Briefly, the study 
employed an approach similar to ones used previously to recruit a representative sample in 
this hard-to-reach population.17–19 This involved two steps: (1) identifying and selecting 
residential camps, and (2) identifying and selecting workers within camps. Farmworker 
residential sites chosen for this study were located in three eastern North Carolina counties: 
Harnett, Johnston, and Sampson. The North Carolina Farmworkers Project, a community 
research partner, served all of the camps in the region and provided a list of camps to the 
study team. Camps from the list were selected in simple random order. If a randomly 
selected camp was not occupied, interviewers went to the next site on the randomized list.
A census was completed at all the selected camps in which farmworkers gave preliminary 
consent to participate. Farmworkers at each camp were recruited from the census list; no 
more than six participants were recruited per camp to ensure that at least 50 camps were 
included in the study. Farmworkers at 62 camps were asked to participate in the study; 
workers at eight camps declined to participate, and growers refused to allow study personnel 
to recruit at two camps. The total number of residents across 52 camps was 1076 (mean = 
20.7 residents per camp); 55 were women. At the 52 camps, 457 individuals were invited to 
participate, and 157 refused, for a participation rate of 66% (300/457). Of the 300 recruited, 
11 reported wearing corrective lenses and were excluded, for a final sample size of 289 
farmworkers with uncorrected vision. Those reporting wearing corrective lenses were 
excluded because some could not produce their corrective lenses, and it was not known if 
these were prescribed for the person wearing them.
Data Collection
Data collection included an interviewer-administered questionnaire and visual acuity 
screening using the Snellen Tumbling E Charts for distance (20 feet) and near (16 inches) 
visual acuity. The questionnaire and visual acuity screening protocol were developed in 
English and translated into Spanish by a native Spanish speaker familiar with vernacular 
specific to Mexican culture and farmworker vocabulary. Five farmworkers were recruited to 
pilot the questionnaire and protocol for the vision screening. Modifications to the 
questionnaire and protocol were made based on farmworker feedback. The questionnaire 
included items addressing demographic variables, background conditions, and eye health. 
Questions on eye health focused on self-assessment of overall vision, distance vision, and

 near vision. Farmworkers were asked to rate their eyesight using both eyes as very good, 
good, moderate, bad, or very bad. They were asked how much difficulty they had in four 
activities requiring far or near vision: (1) recognizing a friend across the street, (2) watching 
television, (3) reading print, and (4) doing work or hobbies that require near vision. The five 
response categories were none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme/cannot do.
Interviewers fluent in Spanish performed both monocular and binocular visual acuity 
screening tests using the Snellen Tumbling E Charts at distance and near. These require the 
worker to indicate the orientation of the E by pointing up, down, left, or right. The Snellen 
Tumbling E chart was chosen to eliminate the variable effect of crowding and use of various 
random letters,20 and to eliminate literacy demands inherent in charts using letters or 
numbers. Original standardized charts (Precision Vision; La Salle, IL) for use in the clinical 
setting were used. Appropriate measures were taken to make sure that the charts were well 
lit and placed in locations free of distractions, light reflections, glare, or visual obstruction.
Interviewers participated in a one-day training program conducted by investigators and 
project coordinators. Interviewers demonstrated mastery of executing all examination 
protocols in Spanish by the end of the training and participated in the pilot testing of the 
examination protocol prior to the study. Project coordinators experienced in administering 
eye screenings supervised the interviewers in the field to ensure standardized protocols were 
followed. Vision screenings and self-reported vision questions were administered by 
different trained interviewers. All procedures were approved by the Wake Forest School of 
Medicine Institutional Review Board. Signed informed consent was obtained from each 
participant.
Values for distance visual impairment, based on visual acuity measurement, were 
categorized as: none (20/10 to 20/40), moderate (> 20/40 to 20/100), and severe (> 20/100). 
Values for near visual impairment are none (20/10 to 20/40), moderate (> 20/40 to < 
20/200), and severe (≥20/200). These categories were based on the literature, which 
frequently reports 20/40 as a threshold for visual impairment.21,22 Visual acuity of 20/100 
has been suggested as a functional threshold for distance in occupational settings.23
Gender and age were obtained during the interview; age was classified into one of three 
groups (18–29, 30–39, >40). Last eye examination was assessed by asking individuals if 
they had their eyes checked: never, 5 or more years ago, 1–4 years ago, or less than a year 
ago. Reason for not having his/her eyes checked in the past 12 months was assessed by 
asking if it was due to: cost or insurance, not having or knowing an eye doctor, 
transportation or traveling distance, there was no reason to go, did not think about it, and 
other, where they were asked to provide a reason.
Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for the sample demographic characteristics and the 
results of the standardized uncorrected visual screening test for distance and near vision. 
Self-reported uncorrected visual acuity data are described by counts and frequencies. Cross-
tabulations were used to compare standardized vision screening with self-reported overall 
vision, self-reported distance, and self-reported near vision. Sensitivities and specificities

 were calculated in order to examine how well self-reported visual function predicts actual 
visual acuity measured by a standardized vision screening in this population.
RESULTS
The sample consisted of 275 men and 14 women (Table 1). Approximately two-thirds 
(69.2%) were between 18 and 39 years of age; the remainder were forty years or older 
(mean=34.6, SD=10.2).
Previous Professional Eye Examination
Most (74.4%) farmworkers had never had their vision screened by a health professional; and 
an additional 17% had not had their vision screened in one or more years. Of those who had 
never had their vision screened, almost three-quarters (70.7%) had never thought about 
doing so; 11.4% stated that cost or lack of insurance was a barrier, and 11.6% reported that 
they did not have or know an eye doctor, could not get to a healthcare site due to long 
distances or transportation, or had no reason to have their vision screened. The remaining 
3.3% farmworkers reported some other reason for not having their vision screened such as 
lack of time or because the doctor spoke only English.
Visual Acuity Screening
Results of the distance vision screening (for the right and left eyes, respectively) showed that 
a small number of farmworkers had moderate (7, 3) or severe impairment (6, 3) (Table 2). 
When binocular distance visual impairment was screened, 98.3% of workers had normal 
vision. The near vision screening found more individuals with abnormal vision: moderate 
visual impairment was found in about 10% of workers for each eye and for 6.6% of the total 
sample for binocular vision. Few workers had severe impairment for near vision.
Age was associated with the prevalence of visual impairment (moderate and severe, 
combined. For binocular distance vision, 4 of 89 (4.5%) farmworkers aged 40 and older had 
impaired vision, compared to only 1 of 200 (0.5%) farmworkers less than 40. Likewise, for 
binocular near vision, 19 of 89 (21.3%) farmworkers aged 40 and older had impaired vision, 
compared to only 1 of 200 (0.5%) farmworkers less than 40.
Self-Reported Vision
Only about a third reported their eyesight to be very good (7.3%) or good (29.1%)(Table 3). 
Over half (58.8%) rated their eyesight as moderate, and the remainder as bad (3.5%) or very 
bad (1.4%). For self-reported distance vision tasks, difficulty recognizing a friend across the 
street was reported by 5.9% and difficulty watching television was reported by 19.7%. 
Approximately a quarter of farmworkers reported mild to extreme difficulty with near vision 
tasks: 23.8% had difficulty reading fine print, and 25% had trouble doing work or hobbies 
requiring up close vision.
Comparing Visual Acuity Screening and Self-Reported Vision
For distance vision, 5 farmworkers were identified as having moderate to severe binocular 
impairment by the screening, but only 3 of those farmworkers identified themselves as

 having bad to very bad vision (sensitivity = 60%) (Table 4). Two hundred and eighty-four 
farmworkers were identified as having no binocular impairment for distance vision by 
screening, and 273 rated themselves as having very good to moderate vision (specificity = 
96.1%). For near vision, 20 farmworkers were identified as having moderate to severe 
binocular impairment by the screening, but only 4 of those farmworkers rated themselves as 
having bad to very bad vision (sensitivity = 20%). Two hundred and sixty-nine farmworkers 
were identified as having no impairment in near vision by screening, and 259 rated 
themselves as having very good to moderate vision (specificity = 96.3%).
Both self-reported distance vision questions about difficulty watching television and 
difficulty recognizing a friend across the street had sensitivities of 0% when compared to the 
distance visual acuity screening (Table 5). In both these cases, none of the 5 farmworkers 
who were identified as having moderate to severe impairment by the distance screening self-
identified as having a vision problem of any kind. The specificities for both distance vision 
questions of difficulty watching television and difficulty recognizing a friend across the 
street were high. Almost all of the farmworkers who were identified as having no distance 
impairment by the screening rated themselves for both distance vision questions as having 
very good to moderate vision.
Similarly, when compared to the screening, both self-reported near vision questions had low 
sensitivities of 10%. For both questions, only 2 of the 20 farmworkers who were identified 
as having moderate to severe vision impairment by the near vision screening rated their near 
vision as bad to very bad. The specificities for near vision items were high. Almost all 
farmworkers who were identified as having no impairment by the administered near vision 
screening also self-identified for both near vision questions as having very good to moderate 
vision.
DISCUSSION
Immigrant Latino communities in the US experience barriers to health services utilization, 
including language and cultural barriers, lack of healthcare insurance, unavailability of 
services and transportation, fears related to immigration status, and different interpretations 
of health and illness.15,17,24–27 Farmworkers, in particular, access health services only when 
necessary,28 and most have never visited a medical clinic or doctor for a vision 
screening.3,11 The California Agricultural Worker Health Survey (CAWHS) indicates that 
two-thirds of all agricultural workers have never had an eye screening,2 a figure close to the 
74.4% of farmworkers in this study. The most common reasons for farmworkers not having 
had a vision screening are similar to those reported previously.2
Latinos are the fastest growing and largest minority group in the United States. A few 
studies have addressed visual impairment among the Latino population29,30; however, visual 
impairment studies among Latino migrant farmworkers are scarce and limited to self-
reported data rather than standardized vision screening.11,12,29 Results from this study 
expand on existing data by documenting the prevalence of visual impairment beyond the 
inherent limitations of self-reported questionnaires.

 Findings from the vision examinations indicate that a number of farmworkers experience 
moderate to severe visual impairment, placing them at risk for occupational injury or further 
vision problems if their vision remains uncorrected.4,31,32,33 The proportion of farmworkers 
with any visual impairment in this study is 1.7% for distance and 6.9% for near. Monocular 
screening results (data not shown) were similar; more farmworkers had impaired near vision 
than distance vision. Farmworkers with visual impairment are at a higher risk of injury 
because they may not recognize cues that can alert them to potential occupational and 
environmental hazards.4,5 For example, poor light during dusk or dawn hours in combination 
with visual impairment may result in higher risks for slips and falls while walking or 
operating farm equipment. The greater proportion with near vision impairment is 
particularly important because of the work farmworkers do in picking crops where branches 
and other parts of plants pose risks for injuries,3 the resistance of workers to wear eye 
protection,11,12,16,34 and the frequent unavailability of eye protection.11,12,16
In this study, visual impairment is more common among individuals aged 40 years and older. 
The overall rate of moderate to severe distance vision impairment in US adults aged 40 years 
and older is 4.3%21 comparable to the rate of 4.5% among farmworkers of the same age. 
Similarly, the rate for near vision impairment among farmworkers 40 and older in this study 
(21.3%) is comparable to the overall national rate (25%) for near vision impairment.35 Rates 
among the 40 years and older group from this study of Latino farmworkers are higher than 
rates reported in a Latino population-based study. The Los Angeles Latino Eye Study 
(LALES) reported that 0.9% of Latinos aged 40 and older had visual impairment or 
blindness.30 It is possible that farmworkers’ poor access to health services results in more 
untreated disease (e.g., diabetes) that impairs vision.29 Alternately, the LALES may have 
lower rates due to differences in the populations studied (e.g., different ethnicities, different 
lifetime experiences with health care).
This study adds to the current literature by comparing results from the standardized vision 
screening, rarely conducted on a general, non-clinic-based farm-working population, to self-
reported assessment questionnaires about farmworker vision that are more commonly used 
in surveys of farmworker health. Self-reported assessment of distance vision (difficulty 
watching television) is slightly worse than that obtained by Quandt et al.11 (19.7% vs. 
13.0%) in a similar farmworker population. Similarly, self-reported near vision assessment 
also indicates that a larger percentage of farmworkers experience a problem with reading 
print (23.8%) and performing tasks requiring up close vision (25%) than that obtained by 
Quandt et al.11 (19.5% and 9.0%, respectively). Farmworkers who have difficulty 
performing close tasks (i.e., cutting crops with sharp blades, sharpening tools, picking 
orchard crops) are at risk of injuring themselves while performing day-to-day occupational 
activities.34 Visual impairment can result in farmworkers receiving fewer visual cues that 
alert them of potential hazards.4,5 Inadequate perception of distances to sharp objects (i.e., 
branches, twigs) resulting from poor near vision can result in eye abrasions or penetrating 
eye wounds.34,36
Assessment questions about overall vision and self-reported ability to perform various tasks 
that require either distance or near vision appear to be inadequate for farmworkers to report 
visual impairment accurately. None of the questions have a sensitivity exceeding 60%, and 
Quandt et al.

 many of the sensitivities are close to 0%, indicating that migrant farmworkers who have a 
visual impairment may not be able to recognize that a problem exists unless they receive a 
vision screening. Self-reported questionnaires appear to be valid only among farmworkers 
who have no visual impairment. Most farmworkers do not seek healthcare due to a variety of 
factors including limited healthcare facilities, pressure to work, and cultural/linguistic 
barriers;29 and their vision status is not usually known. Therefore, relying solely on self-
reported data to identify vision problems is likely to overlook the majority of visual 
impairment cases among migrant farmworkers. These results contrast with those of the 
LALES that reports strong associations in the general Latino population aged 40 years and 
older of self-reported visual functioning and visual impairment.10 The LALES included only 
data from individuals 40 and older, so this may account for the differences: it may be that 
older individuals are better at assessing their visual function deficits, and that their deficits 
are more severe.
This study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. The study had a participation rate 
of 66%. No data are available on selection bias. Farmworkers with the most severe visual 
impairment may have chosen not to participate in fear of losing their jobs or having their 
work tasks restricted. This would result in underestimating of the prevalence of visual 
impairment. The few workers who had corrective lenses were excluded, as there was no way 
to ascertain the source or appropriateness of their lenses. The vision screening was not a 
complete eye examination and does not measure other problems (e.g., impaired peripheral 
vision, depth perception, or ability to perceive contrasts) which could also increase the risk 
of occupational injuries among farmworkers. Additional studies using more comprehensive 
eye examinations are necessary to measure the prevalence of eye conditions that may impact 
the risk of occupational injuries. Finally, specificity and sensitivity results should be 
interpreted with caution, as the vision screenings identified a small number of farmworkers 
with vision impairment or blindness. Additional studies are necessary to establish 
statistically generalizable sensitivity and specificity findings. Self-reported assessments that 
are used to calculate sensitivity and specificity may also be biased, as farmworkers might not 
have reported their vision accurately if they were afraid that it might affect their job and 
questions about other situations of vision use might be more relevant to farmworkers’ life 
experiences.
Nevertheless, this study is among the first to obtain standardized screening data for visual 
impairment from a general, non-clinic-based population of migrant farmworkers. It is also 
one of the only studies to compare self-reported vision assessment to measured visual 
impairment data among these workers. Findings indicate that some farmworkers have 
serious visual impairment, and they do not obtain routine eye examinations. While vision 
exams at farmworker residential sites provide an opportunity for workers to become more 
aware of the importance of a vision screening, future studies are necessary in order to assess 
comprehensive eye health beyond the scope of standardized vision exams.
