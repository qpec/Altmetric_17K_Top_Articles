Abstract
Background: Osteopathic medicine is an emerging and complementary method used in neonatology.
Methods: Outcomes were the mean difference in length of stay (LOS) and costs between osteopathy and alternative treatment
group. A comprehensive literature search of (quasi)- randomized controlled trials (RCTs), was conducted from journal inception to
May, 2015. Eligible studies must have treated preterm infants directly in the crib or bed and Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment
(OMT) must have been performed by osteopaths. A rigorous Cochrane-like method was used for study screening and selection, risk
of bias assessment and data reporting. Fixed effect meta-analysis was performed to synthesize data.
Results: 5 trials enrolling 1306 infants met our inclusion criteria. Although the heterogeneity was moderate (I2=61%, P=0.03),
meta-analysis of all five studies showed that preterm infants treated with OMT had a significant reduction of LOS by 2.71 days (95%
CI �3.99, �1.43; P<0.001). Considering costs, meta-analysis showed reduction in the OMT group (�1,545.66€, �1,888.03€,
�1,203.29€, P<0.0001). All studies reported no adverse events associated to OMT. Subgroup analysis showed that the benefit of
OMT is inversely associated to gestational age.
Conclusions: The present systematic review showed the clinical effectiveness of OMT on the reduction of LOS and costs in a large
population of preterm infants.

1. Introduction
Prematurity is a serious health care problem.[1] Compared to full-
term newborns, the likelihood of being affected by poor health,
developmental and cognitive delays within the first year of life is
higher in premature babies.[2,3] This in turn will result in
extensive psychological, physical, and economic costs.[1–3] One
of the main factor contributing to costs is length of hospital stay
(LOS),[4] also considered a proxy of health infant status.[4–7]
Osteopathic medicine is a noninvasive, drug-free manual
medicine, classified as a complementary and alternative medicine
and works through manual manipulation techniques[8–10], which
has been shown to be 1 emerging strategy to improve newborns’
health outcomes. One of its core concepts is somatic dysfunction
(SD) defined as “impaired or altered function of related
components of the somatic (body framework) system: skeletal,
arthrodial and myofascial structures, and their related vascular,
lymphatic, and neural elements.”[11] SD is diagnosed on the basis
of specific palpation criteria, such as tissue alteration, asymmetry,
range of motion and tenderness, also known as TART.[11] The
cranial strain pattern, consisting in a somatic dysfunction of the
head, is defined as a membranous articular strain due to
abnormal dural tension. The 2 core components of osteopathic
health care are the patient structural diagnostic evaluation,
followed by the application of range of manual manipulative
treatment techniques.[28]. A specific osteopathic evaluation in
newborns has been described in the literature.[12] Studies seem to
report possible correlation between SD and specific clinical
conditions, although more robust data are needed.[13,14]
Specific metabolic and neurological alterations were identified
in SD situ. Those include hypersympathetic state[15] and
metabolic changes.[16,17] Generally, in-vitro and in-vivo research
suggested that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) has
anti-inflammatory and parasympathetic effects.[18–21] Although
recent studies showed promising clinical results for osteopathic
medicine in the context of prematurity, a recent review of the
published literature on pediatrics has demonstrated elusive
results.[22] Despite the arguable methodology used in the review
and the broader topic, the general quality of research included
was considered poor.[22] One understudied aspect regarding
prematurity is the effect of OMT on LOS. No systematic reviews
have been carried out considering this outcome. Therefore, a

 comprehensive review of evidence for this vulnerable population
would be useful in understanding the emerging osteopathic
literature and may help provide a target for future interventions
within the existing NICU health care programs. The aim of the
present systematic review was to assess the extent to which
osteopathic medicine is effective compared to the control group in
reducing LOS, hospital costs, and adverse events in premature
infants.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Studies
The current systematic review included single- and multicenter
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and controlled
clinical trials. Due to the lack of controlled studies on the topic we
included controlled before and after studies, with at least 1
intervention and 1 control site; interrupted time series studies
which present at least 2 points of outcome measurement pre- and
postintervention. Studies which have LOS as the primary
outcome, or those which reported LOS as the secondary outcome
to a health care program, were included. No language restriction
was applied. Trials which were solely concerned with the
collection of data from infants were excluded. In addition, case-
control, case-series, case-report, conference proceedings, and
abstracts were excluded.
2.2. Population
The eligible population for this review was preterm infants
clinically stable and those recuperating from acute illness.
2.3. Intervention
The intervention of interest is OMT. The term OMT currently
includes nearly 25 types of manual manipulative treatment
technique. These techniques are used to treat SD within the
body’s framework, including skeletal, arthrodial, and myofascial
structures.[11] OMT procedures have been classified as direct or
indirect.[11]
Eligible studies had to treat preterm infants directly in the crib
or bed and OMT had to be performed by osteopaths. Due to the
intrinsic clinical variability of manual techniques in terms of
magnitude, frequency and time, no dosage restrictions (frequency
and time) were applied. The comparisons were either sham
therapy or no treatment. Studies including combined manual
treatments were excluded. The OMT intervention and/or sham
treatment could be administered in combination with usual/
routine care.
2.4. Outcomes
The primary outcome was the mean difference in LOS measured
in days between the osteopathy group and the alternative
treatment group.
Secondary outcomes were:
� cost reduction (measured in Euros);
� weight gain, average weight in grams per kilo per day,
considered as either continuous (mean difference) or categori-
cal variable (categorized by the Z score);
� morbidity, measured as adverse clinical events, that is
respiratory,
gastrointestinal,
neurological,
cardiovascular,
and genitourinary side effects (measured as the proportion
of subjects with clinical complications in the osteopathy group
compared to comparisons);
� long-term neuro-developmental outcomes measured at 1, 3, 6,
12, and 24 months using motor and cognitive tests.
2.5. Search methods
The identification of the studies was conducted by a comprehen-
sive computerized search of Science Direct, MEDLINE, SCOPUS,
Scholar Google, clinicaltrial.gov, the Cochrane Library, chiloras/
MANTIS, Pubmed Europe, OSTMED.DR, and Osteopathic
Research Web. Other sources considered were as follows: web
searching, grey literature, conference proceedings, national trials
registers. Terms used for the search were summarized as follows:
osteopathic (MeSH and Free term), manipulat∗ (Free term and
MeSH), treatment (Free Term and MeSH), medicine (MeSH),
premature∗ (Free term and MeSH), infant∗(Free term and
MeSH), preemie∗(MeSH), and newborn∗(MeSH).
The research was conducted from journal inception to May 17,
2015. Duplicate records were identified in EndNOTE and
eliminated.
2.6. Selection of study
Two
reviewers
(DL
and
NR)
conducted
study
selection
independently based on the explicit search strategy. Discrep-
ancies were resolved by consensus with an external arbiter.
According to inclusion criteria, reviewers independently screened
titles and abstracts. Full-texts were then retrieved and assessed.
An independent pediatrician (GL) and an osteopath (MA)
controlled the scientific relevance of the literature.
2.7. Data collection and evaluation
Two reviewers, considering type of interventions, number of
patients, study results, and other descriptive characteristics of the
included trials, carried out data extraction independently.
Disagreements were discussed and reported by consensus. If
data were not reported in the study, the authors were contacted.
All data were kept on a specific hard disk, managed only by the 2
reviewers.
Each study was assessed according to the Cochrane risk of bias
methods. A 4-point Likert scale was used for evaluation and
included: very low, low, high and unclear risk of bias scores
across 5 domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment;
blinding to personnel; blinding to outcome analysis and other
bias.[23] CBA and ITS studies were evaluated using the tools
proposed by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of
Care Group.[24]
2.8. Measures of treatment effect
Continuous data were analyzed using mean differences with 95%
confidence intervals (MD; 95% CI). Dichotomous outcomes
were presented as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence
intervals (CI). Missing data were handled by contacting the
authors for more information. Where missing data were known,
the reasons were described.
2.9. Assessment of heterogeneity
Studies were pooled only if there was significant homogeneity.
This was assessed using the I2 statistic, which assessed how much
Lanaro et al. Medicine (2017) 96:12
Medicine
2
 of the variation between studies is due to heterogeneity rather
than to chance.[25] Values over 75% suggested considerable
heterogeneity, but its significance also depended upon the
magnitude and direction of the effect and the strength of
the evidence. Reasons for heterogeneities may be multiple
including methodological, statistical or clinical heterogeneity.
To identify possible publication bias, funnel plots were used.[25]
2.10. Data synthesis
An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Data were reported
as mean, point estimate, percentage, and range. Dispersion was
presented as standard deviation (SD) and 95% confidence
interval (CI). In the case of dichotomous outcome, the relative
risk (RR) was greater than 1 if more patients were successfully
treated by the osteopathy group than by the intervention group.
An estimated pooled weighted average of RRs, using the
Mantel–Haenszel fixed-effect method, with a 95% CI, was
calculated. Due to the possibility that same studies reported
continuous data as median and range, methods in the estimation
of the sample mean and standard deviation were used.[26]
Where meta-analysis was not possible, results were presented
using summary and descriptive statistics.
When feasible, subgroup analyses were focused on: age at birth
(categorizing in less than 31 weeks, between 32 and 34 weeks,
and between 35 and 37 weeks), time to first osteopathic session,
diagnosis-related group and type of treatment. Review Manager
v. 5.2.6 and R statistical software v3.12, packages “meta” were
used for statistical analysis.
3. Results
The review process is shown in the flowchart of the study (Fig. 1):
670 articles and abstracts were identified from the initial searches.
After removal of duplicates, 613 articles were assessed for
eligibility; 600 were excluded, as it was clear from their abstracts
or titles that they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Common
reasons for rejection included the use of techniques and
approaches different from OMT, focus on a different pediatric
population, the use of noninterventional trials and reviews on
general pediatric sample. The remaining 13 were screened for
full-text review, of which 8 were excluded for the reasons showed
in Fig. 1. Five studies met our inclusion criteria and were finally
included in the systematic review.
3.1. Characteristics of the included studies
The included studies had a total population number of 1306
preterm infants born in European public NICUs. Four studies
were conducted in Italy[27–30] and 1 in Austria.[31] The
publication period ranged from 2007 to 2015.
Methodology used across studies revealed high homogeneity in
terms of method of recruitment, recruitment setting, population,
and type of control group.
All studies considered LOS as clinical outcome, 4 trials as primary
outcome,[27–30] whereas 1 considered it as a secondary outcome.[31]
Further studies’ aims were: average daily gut symptoms,[27]
costs,[28–30] daily weight gain,[28–30] meconium evacuation, full
enteral feeding, and weight gain at discharge home.[31]
A fairly homogeneous study design was revealed, 4 were
RCTs[28–31] and 1 a nonrandomized observational study.[27]
Four out of 5 trials were single-center[27–29,31] and 1 multicen-
ter.[30] Newborns population ranged from severe to late
prematurity (Table 1).
3.2. Intervention details
Four out of 5 studies administered a need-based approach,[27–30]
whereas Haiden et al[31] used a pre-determined structured
treatment protocol. Techniques used were indirect[27–30] and
visceral.[31] Specific indirect techniques were: myofascial release,
balanced ligamentous/membranous tension, indirect fluidic,
and v-spread. The duration of treatment protocol was reported
in 4 trials only[27–30] and ranged from 20 to 30 minutes.
Frequency varied from 2 to 3 times per week and the treatment
period
was
for
either
the
entire
hospitalization[27–30]
or
1 week.[31] The only study, which reported details on the type
and sequence of intervention, and the treatment plan was Haiden
et al.[31]
In
all
studies,
treatment
was
performed
either
by
osteopaths[27–30] or by student in osteopathy,[31] but only 2
studies[28,29] gave data on the number of practitioners enrolled, 4
and 2, respectively.
Control groups used were standard care protocols. In addition
to usual care, 3 studies[28–30] included osteopathic evaluation,
without any treatment, which mimicked the OMT session in
terms of duration, dose, and length. All osteopathic interventions
and control procedures were administered in the hospital.
3.3. Study quality-risk of bias
3.3.1. Allocation. Low risk of sequence generation bias was
scored for all studies, which employed an adequate randomiza-
tion method, except for Pizzolorusso et al.[27] as a non-RCT study
design. Due to the nature of the population, allocation
concealment was assessed as low risk of bias.

 3.3.2. Blinding of personnel and outcome assessors. Three
studies reported that NICU staff was blinded to patient
allocations and also unaware of study design and outcomes.
One study had a high risk of bias as osteopathic physicians and
patients were unblinded,[31] whereas another trial did not report
data on blinding of participants and personnel producing an
unclear risk of performing bias.[27]
3.3.3. Selective bias. Study protocols were made available for
all research except for Pizzolorusso et al.[27] Low risk of attrition
and reporting bias were thus reported for 4 studies,[28–31]
whereas unclear for 1 study only.[27]
3.3.4. Other bias. The quality of studies included was further
assessed considering: conflict of interest, funding source, ethical
approval, informed consent, confidentiality, declaration of
interests, access to data, trial registration, data collection, data
management, and data monitoring committee. All studies
included, apart from Pizzolorusso et al,[27] reported sufficient
and appropriate information on source of funding, ethical
statement, and informed consent approval. Trial registration
details were also reported. Regarding data collection, conflict and
declaration
of
interest,
trials
included
reported
adequate
information. None of the research detailed any information
regarding confidentiality, access to data, data management, and
data monitoring committee (Fig. 2).
3.4. Primary outcome: length of hospital stay (LOS)
3.4.1. OMT vs usual care. All 5 studies assessed the LOS (n=
1306, 645 preterm were allocated in the OMT group and 661 to
the control group). Although the heterogeneity was moderate
(I2=61%, P=0.03), meta-analysis of all 5 studies showed that
preterms who received OMT in addition to usual care had a
significant reduction of LOS by 2.71 days (95% CI –3.99, –1.43;
P<0.001, Fig. 3) compared to those who did not undergo any
osteopathic care.
3.5. Secondary outcomes
3.5.1. Cost per infant per hospitalization. Three of the 5
studies included contained data for costs (n=915, 462 preterm
infants treated with OMT and 453 as control). Meta-analysis of
these 3 studies showed that preterm infants had a significant
lower costs compared to those allocated in the control group
(–1545.66€, –1888.03€, –1203.29€, P<0.0001, Table 2),
although
results
indicated
high
heterogeneity
(I2=90%,
P<0.0001).
3.5.2. Morbidity.
All
studies
reported
no
adverse
events
associated
to
osteopathic
intervention.
Arguably,
Haiden
et al[31] claimed in their study that the longer time to full enteral
feeding in the OMT group could be interpreted as a possible
adverse effect.

 Cerritelli et al[27,30] were the only 2 studies reporting drop-out
data. In the 2015 study, authors showed that the rate in the
OMT-study group was 2.2% (8/360) versus 4.7% (17/360) in the
usual care control group (X2=3.36; RR=0.47; 95% CI
0.21–1.08; Z=1.76, P=0.07), whereas in the 2013 trial, authors
described that 8 preterm infants were lost during the trial
compared to 1 on the control group.
3.5.3. Long-term outcomes. None of the included studies
measured long-term neuro-developmental outcomes at any time-
point and using any neuro-developmental assessments.
3.6. Subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses were carried out according to gestational age,
considering severe (<32 weeks), moderate (32.0–33.6 weeks),
and late (34.0–36.6 weeks) prematurity (Table 2).[32]
3.6.1. Very preterm infants. Two studies enrolled newborns
born before the 32nd week of gestation (n=118, 58 received
OMT and 60 were allocated to the control group). Meta-analysis
showed that preterm infants who underwent osteopathic care
were discharged earlier compared to controls by a mean of
approximately 9 days (95% CI –13.46, –3.81 days; P<0.001;
see Fig. 3).
3.6.2. Moderate preterm infants. Meta-analysis of the 3 studies
that had comparative characteristics for reporting data on
moderate prematurity (n=311, with 163 treated with OMT and
148 controls) showed that preterm infants allocated to the
osteopathy group were discharged significantly earlier than
preterms in the control group by a mean of 3.08 days (95% CI
–5.16, –0.99 days; P<0.01; see Fig. 3).
3.6.3. Late-preterm infants. Late preterm infants were consid-
ered in 3 studies (n=477, with 233 in the OMT group and 244 in
the control group). Meta-analysis showed that infants receiving
OMT were discharged significantly earlier compared to the
control group by a mean of more than 2 days (95% CI –3.63,
–0.78 days; P<0.01; see Fig. 3).
4. Discussion
The present systematic review aimed at evaluating the effective-
ness of OMT on preterm infants. It included 5 RCTs involving
1306 patients. Analysis of the studies available for this review
suggested that the administration of osteopathic medicine to
infants born prematurely produced a significant reduction of LOS
by almost 3 days on average. This will lead to a reduction of costs
for the local health care system of more than €1500 per preterm
per LOS.

 Interestingly, the earlier the OMT intervention, the larger the
benefit for newborns. In fact, it can be highlighted as high
prematurity newborns (<32 wk GA) can benefit of the highest
osteopathic effect (reduction of almost 9 days), whereas late
preterm infants of the lowest (2 days). These results can be better
understood in light of the differences among the 3 preterm
subgroups (GA<32; 32–33.6; 34–36.6 wks): average duration
of LOS, longer for very preterm infants; policy of local hospitals
(likelihood of admitting a late preterm is significant lower), and
need for cure (high premature infants require longer, and more
accurate cares). As far as adverse events were concerned, none of
the trials included reported any adverse event. This could imply
that osteopathic treatment could be considered a safe procedure.
Considering the characteristics of trials: included studies were
conducted in clinical settings and in different European countries,
although 4 out of 5 studies were carried out in Italy, suggesting
that the findings would be best applicable in those contexts.
Research included treatments administered by experienced
practitioners with no apparent impact on outcomes. It should
be pointed out that the studies were homogeneous in design and
study outcomes, therefore suggesting reliability and validity of
results.
4.1. Implications for practice
OMT seems to be effective in the treatment of premature babies
in terms of reducing days of hospitalization and costs (at the net
of osteopathic costs). Moreover, it was shown to be a safe
procedure, considering short-term outcomes.
This review introduces new evidence that the use of osteopathy
in very preterm infants produces greater improvements compared
to late ones. From a clinical standpoint, the use of osteopathic
procedures would seem to be a desirable choice when compared
to usual care only. As a possible impact on local healthcare
system, the use of osteopathy for preterm infants might be
recommended as adjuvant therapy within the NICU routine
practice. This could support the idea of integrated multidisciplin-
ary medicine, promoted from the WHO and be in line with the
aim
of
local
and
central
healthcare
strategies
on
costs’
optimization. From a policy perspective, potential implications
can be predicted in terms of: health care system implementation,
accessibility to complementary care and sustainability of health
care costs. However, the implementation of healthcare system
needs to be considered in light of: (a) robust results: several
aspects of osteopathic research are still missing, that is, specific
disease-based effects, elective care vs acute care; (b) evidence-
based multidisciplinary practice: the role of osteopathy within
routine-based multidisciplinary NICU environment; (c) evolution
of neonatology care: deep understanding of current processes
delivering healthcare procedures in neonatology.
4.2. Possible mechanisms of action
It has been suggested that preterm infants are associated with
higher levels of pro-inflammatory circulating substances and
immaturity of the vegetative system. Matoba et al[33] reported
more recently that levels of 12 biomarkers (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8,
IL-10, MCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, sIL-6ra, sTNF-RI, TNFa and
TREM-1) were higher in preterm compared to term infants,
whereas IL-1b and IL-18 were lower. Another recent study by
McElrath et al[34] observed that cytokines measured on the first
day of life were higher in preterm infants born after complications
associated with infections, compared to preterm infants born
after complications like pre-eclampsia. Furthermore, preterm
infants appear to have an abnormal maturation of autonomic
nervous system. Yiallourou et al[35] reported that compared to
term infants, preterms exhibit a diminished parasympathetic
modulation of the heart associated to greater respiratory-
mediated changes and lower sympathetic modulation of blood
pressure. In addition, Longin et al[36] demonstrated that
gestational age of newborns is correlated with a change in the
heart rate variability.
Speculating on the possible mechanisms of action of osteopa-
thy on preterm infants, it can be argued that OMT seems to be
associated with a reduction of pro-inflammatory substances both
in vitro and in vivo [37,38] hypothesizing an anti-inflammatory
role of OMT, although only partially confirmed by recent
clinical-based research.[39] Therefore, OMT could reduce the
release of cytokines and the sympathetic activity creating a
cascade of biological and neurological events able to modulate
both inflammatory and ANS mechanisms.[40,41]
More recently, preliminary lab-based evidence showed the
effect of specific osteopathic techniques on the enhancement of
the lymphatic and immune system
[42,43] by improving the
leukocytes
count
and
interleukin-8
(IL-8).
Findings
were
confirmed by a research article published in 2014 where
significant differences were detected in the levels of immune
molecules, including IL-8, between OMT and sham light-touch
control.[44] OMT, therefore, could have an effect on the
immunological profile of specific circulating cytokines and
leukocytes. Nevertheless, the lack of specific studies on newborns
prevents any formal assumption on the biological effects of
osteopathy on this population, calling, therefore, for more
systematic and pragmatic trials.
4.3. Limitations
This review followed the recommendations of the Cochrane
Collaboration, using sensitivity analysis as necessary. The
method used for data analysis used assumptions that could
not be verified because there was no access to the original data.
Specifically, it was assumed that data had a parametric
distribution; this may not be correct in particular for costs.
Thus, this may have yielded conservative results, that is,
underestimation of differences. Despite the total number of
patients, the subgroup analyses showed small sample sizes. This
could be considered critical for outcome variables (e.g., LOS). A
further limitation is relative to the medication plan, of which
reporting was lacking in all studies. It can be argued that drugs’
effects can significantly influence the clinical benefit of treatment.
In addition, screening the papers’ authorships it should be noticed
that more authors were involved in 4 out of 5 included papers.
This could potentially lead to bias. However, the likelihood of a
significant influence on the validity of the results is very low, due
to the large sample size included in the review. Finally, another
limitation to the consideration of osteopathic procedure as
necessary within the management of preterm infants, especially
when very premature, consists in the lack of data showing the
effect of OMT on long-term respiratory and neurological
outcomes.
5. Conclusion
The present systematic review showed the clinical effectiveness of
OMT on the reduction of LOS, with subsequent economic
advantages, in a large population of preterm infants. Despite the

 positive results, further research is needed to define potential
limitations on the type of patients for whom osteopathic medicine
is appropriate and to determine the optimal clinical and research
scenario at which to intervene with osteopathic treatment.
Moreover, such trials should aim at monitoring and reporting
adverse events as well as long-term growth and neurodevelop-
mental outcomes, whereas addressing the
possibility that
nutritional intake, drug administration and NICU empowerment
strategies might mask the effects of osteopathic treatment.
Furthermore, upcoming research should study the underpinning
mechanisms of osteopathic treatment in preterms, both healthy
and with specific pathologies, to allow further advances in the
biological understanding of manual medicine effects. This can be
predicted as a milestone to plan future clinical neonatological
applications of osteopathic medicine. In conclusion, based on the
previous literature, osteopathy may offer further advantage over
routine care only.
