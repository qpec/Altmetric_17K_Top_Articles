ABSTRACT
Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of a ‘Do not
interrupt’ bundled intervention to reduce
non-medication-related interruptions to nurses
during medication administration.
Methods A parallel eight cluster randomised
controlled study was conducted in a major
teaching hospital in Adelaide, Australia. Four
wards were randomised to the intervention
which comprised wearing a vest when
administering medications; strategies for
diverting interruptions; clinician and patient
education; and reminders. Control wards were
blinded to the intervention. Structured direct
observations of medication administration
processes were conducted. The primary
outcome was non-medication-related
interruptions during individual medication
dose administrations. The secondary outcomes
were total interruption and multitasking
rates. A survey of nurses’ experiences was
administered.
Results Over 8 weeks and 364.7 hours, 227
nurses were observed administering 4781
medications. At baseline, nurses experienced 57
interruptions/100 administrations, 87.9% were
unrelated to the medication task being observed.
Intervention wards experienced a significant
reduction in non-medication-related interruptions
from 50/100 administrations (95% CI 45 to 55)
to 34/100 (95% CI 30 to 38). Controlling for
clustering, ward type and medication route
showed a significant reduction of 15 non-
medication-related interruptions/100
administrations compared with control wards.
A total of 88 nurses (38.8%) completed the
poststudy survey. Intervention ward nurses
reported that vests were time consuming,
cumbersome and hot. Only 48% indicated that
they would support the intervention becoming
hospital policy.
Discussion Nurses experienced a high rate of
interruptions. Few were related to the medication
task, demonstrating considerable scope to
reduce unnecessary interruptions. While the
intervention was associated with a statistically
significant decline in non-medication-related
interruptions, the magnitude of this reduction
and its likely impact on error rates should be
considered, relative to the effectiveness of
alternate interventions, associated costs, likely
acceptability and long-term sustainability of such
interventions.
INTRODUCTION
In any one hospital, thousands of medica-
tions are administered to patients each
day. Errors in this process are frequent.1–3
Over the last decade, there has been a
steady increase in the number of studies
reporting
interventions
designed
to
reduce interruptions to nurses during the
preparation and administration of medi-
cations.4–6 These interventions are based
on an underlying assumption that inter-
ruptions are significantly associated with
medication administration errors (MAEs).
Thus by reducing interruptions, these
interventions are designed to result in
fewer MAEs and less harm to patients.
One study demonstrated a direct positive
association
between
interruptions
to
nurses and the frequency and severity of
MAEs in two hospitals,1 adding weight to
the argument that reducing interruptions
may also reduce error rates. A systematic
review4
of
interventions
designed
to
reduce interruptions to nurses during

 medication administration however demonstrated that
despite increasing reports of such interventions there
is limited evidence of their effectiveness to reduce
interruptions or MAEs. The review identified key
methodological limitations of previous studies includ-
ing no randomised controlled trials to assess interven-
tion effectiveness; a reliance on self-reported outcome
measures which are subject to bias; small sample sizes;
limited detail regarding the nature of interruptions
recorded (ie, whether they were related to the medica-
tion task or not); a failure to define ‘interruptions’; an
absence of inter-rater reliability measurement when
multiple observers were used; observers who were not
independent from the study sites; and limited statis-
tical analyses including a failure to account for cluster-
ing by ward.
Introducing ‘Do not interrupt’ interventions has
considerable work process and resource implications
and may also result in unintended consequences.7
Thus, evaluations of patients’ and nurses’ experiences
of such interventions are important in determining the
acceptability and likely sustainability of such interven-
tions. Interventions need to account for those interrup-
tions that are necessary and integral to the medication
administration process5 and target the reduction of
interruptions that are unnecessary to the immediate
safety critical task.
Our aims were to:
1. conduct a controlled, cluster, randomised study to evalu-
ate the effectiveness of a ‘Do not interrupt’ bundled
intervention to reduce non-medication-related interrup-
tions to nurses during medication administration, testing
the feasibility of this study design;
2. assess the impact of adjusting for clustering by ward on
the study outcomes;
3. administer a survey to assess nurses’ experiences and
their views about participating in the study and the
intervention.
METHODS
Study design, participants and randomisation
W
e conducted a parallel eight cluster (four medical
and four surgical wards) randomised controlled study
at a major 650-bed teaching hospital in Adelaide,
Australia. The hospital used paper-based prescribing
and medication administration processes. Eight nurse
managers provided guardian consent for their wards
to be enrolled and randomised. All nurses, excluding
agency staff, were invited to participate and 227
(79%) consented. Nurses were informed that the
study was a direct observational study of medication
administration and preparation tasks. Nursing staff
were blinded to the study aim focused on interrup-
tions and at baseline were blinded to the intervention.
Only intervention ward staff were informed of the
intervention
subsequently.
A
cluster
design
was
selected to allow intervention implementation by
ward to minimise contamination.
Randomisation was conducted by two researchers
(LL and JW) independent of the data collection.
W
ards (clusters) were stratified by type (medical or
surgical) with a 1:1 allocation. T
wo wards of each
type were randomly selected to receive the interven-
tion following baseline data collection.
W
e aimed to randomly collect observational data on
300 individual medication dose administrations per
ward in each of the baseline and postintervention
periods. The study was not powered to detect a differ-
ence after intervention between the two study arms as
neither the size of the intracluster correlation coeffi-
cient (ICC) nor the likely intervention effect size was
known. Ethical approval was obtained
from the
Hospital Research Ethics Committee.
Intervention
The ‘Do not interrupt’ intervention, comprising five
‘bundled’ elements, was administered to the four
wards randomised to the intervention and consisted
of (1) wearing of a ‘Do not interrupt’ medication vest
by nurses when preparing and administering medica-
tions; (2) interactive workshops with nurses regarding
the
purpose
of
the
intervention
to
reduce
non-medication-related interruptions and to identify
local barriers and enablers to intervention use (eg,
where to store vests); (3) brief standardised education
sessions with clinical staff (eg, doctors, allied health);
(4) patient information, which included why nurses
were wearing a vest, and a request not to interrupt
nurses during medication administration unless their
concern was serious and urgent, or related to their
medication. Patients were informed of other nurses
and staff from whom to seek help if required, and (5)
the use of reminders such as posters and stickers to
inform health professionals, patients and visitors not
to interrupt nurses during medication rounds for
safety reasons.
Nurses on intervention wards were required to wear
a disposable red plastic vest (see online supplementary
figure S1) for medication preparation and administra-
tion. The vest served as a visible signal that a nurse
was administering medications and should not be
interrupted. The wearing of vests became ‘business as
usual’ regardless of whether individual nurses had
consented to be observed as part of the study, that is,
all nurses on the intervention wards were required to
wear a vest during all medication rounds.
Education
was
provided
by
the
study
project
manager to intervention ward staff over a minimum
of three sessions across a 3-week period. Information
leaflets were addressed to individual staff on the four
intervention
wards
to
explain
the
intervention.
Notices were placed in central locations and all indi-
vidual patient drawers and medication cabinets on the
intervention wards. A separate information leaflet was
prepared and distributed to patients and relatives
admitted to the wards.

 At the completion of the study, nurse participants
were invited to complete a structured survey seeking
their views about study participation and being sha-
dowed by an observer; the intervention and its
impacts on time to administer medications and inter-
ruptions; and whether they would support ongoing
use of the intervention. Response categories used four
or five-point Likert scales (eg, strongly agree to
strongly disagree) or yes/no. The survey is available
from the authors on request.
Study outcomes
Observations were conducted at the individual medi-
cation dose administration level. The primary study
outcome was rate of non-medication-related interrup-
tions per administration and secondary outcomes
were total interruption and multitasking rates per
administration. Interruptions were defined as ceasing
a current task to respond to an external stimulus (eg,
a question, alarm). Non-medication-related interrup-
tions were those whose content did not relate to the
specific medication tasks being undertaken by the
observed nurse. For example, if an observed nurse is
attempting to administer a drug to patient A and is
then interrupted with a request to double check a
drug for patient B, then that interruption is cate-
gorised as a non-medication-related interruption as it
does not relate to the primary medication task of the
observed nurse. Table 2 provides a listing of the major
subcategories of such interruptions. Multitasking was
defined as performing two tasks in parallel, for
example, preparing a medication while answering a
question.8 Medication administration was defined as
the preparation and administration of one dose to one
patient.
Data collection
Nurse
characteristics
(eg,
classification—registered
nurse, enrolled nurse), ward (ie, medical/surgical) and
details of all medication administrations observed
were recorded (eg, route—oral, intravenous/injection
or other).
The
type
of
interruption
(medication
related or not), physical location (eg, bedside, medica-
tion room, corridor) and source of interruption (eg,
nurse, patient) were also recorded. In the postinter-
vention period, observers also recorded whether or
not nurses on the intervention wards used the vest
during each administration. Multitasking was mea-
sured to allow comparison with previous studies that
included multitasking within their definition of an
interruption. All data items were automatically time
stamped by the data collection software. Observers
collected
data
in
real
time
using
the
W
ork
Observational Method by Activity Timing Software
(WOMBAT)9 on a tablet computer.
Observations were conducted between 07:30 and
21:00 on weekdays and consisted of a representative
mix of administrations by type (eg, oral, intravenous),
nurse classification and time of the day (ie, 08:00,
12:00, 18:00, 20:00). Observations were conducted
between October and December 2012. A schedule
was designed to ensure that similar numbers of
observations were conducted on each day of the week
across the main medication administration times.
The
postintervention
data
collection
commenced
2.5 weeks
after
intervention
implementation.
Five
observers independent from the study hospital under-
took observations. Following extensive training, data
collection commenced when kappa scores, calculated
for observation categories (ie, medication administra-
tions vs other tasks) and interruptions (occurrence)
and medication type (ie, intravenous, oral and other)
exceeded 0.85.10
Analyses
Descriptive statistics were calculated for interruptions,
administrations, interruption rates by study group
(control vs intervention) and study period (preinter-
vention and postintervention) and survey responses.
Based on the intention to treat principle, analyses
were conducted at the individual medication adminis-
tration level and all observations were included.
Multilevel negative binomial modelling was used to
estimate the non-medication-related interruption rate
(dependent variable), changes between intervention
and control wards over preintervention and postinter-
vention
periods
(interaction
term
between
study
period and study group), considering the correlation
of
administrations
occurring
in
the
same
ward
(cluster) and also taking into account overdispersion
(ie, variance is significantly larger than the expected
value). Other independent variables, including ward
type and medication route, were controlled for in the
models. ICCs were calculated based on the model.
The same analyses were conducted for the secondary
outcomes, that is, overall interruptions and multitask-
ing events. Results for all interruptions, as well as for
non-medication-related interruptions, are presented to
allow comparison of our findings with those from
published studies where this distinction in type of
interruption is rarely made, and to assess the likely
consequence
of
this
aggregation
on
conclusions.
Results with and without accounting for clustering are
also presented to allow comparison of findings with
published studies, none of which have controlled for
these factors. For the survey data, descriptive statistics
by study group, including frequency and percentage,
were presented for each survey question. Significance
was set at p<0.05. Data analyses were conducted
using SAS V
.9.4.
RESULTS
Over 364.7 observation hours, 227 nurses were
observed administering 4781 medications.

 Frequency, source and location of interruptions at
baseline
At baseline across the eight wards, we observed 1393
interruptions during 2429 administrations (57 inter-
ruptions/100 administrations). The majority were non-
medication-related
interruptions
(87.9%,
n=1224,
50/100). Control and intervention wards experienced
similar
baseline
interruption
rates
of
respectively
51 and 50 non-medication-related interruptions/100
administrations. On both control and intervention
wards, nurses were interrupted by non-medication-
related issues once or more in around one-third of
medication administrations (32.1%, n=387 in control
and 32.1%, n=393 on intervention wards) (table 1).
The most frequent reasons for non-medication-
related interruptions were questions or discussions
about other patients. The majority were from other
nurses and occurred at the bedside (table 2).
Changes in non-medication-related interruption rates
postintervention
In the postintervention period, nurses on the interven-
tion wards experienced a significant reduction in
non-medication-related interruptions from an average
of 50/100 administrations (95% CI 45 to 55) to 34/
100 administrations (95% CI 30 to 38). Nurses on
the control wards experienced no significant change
(51/100 administrations preintervention; 95% CI 46
to 56 vs 53/100 postintervention; 95% CI 47 to 58)
(table 3). Without considering the cluster design, the
non-medication-related interruptions in the interven-
tion
wards
decreased
by
17/100

 compared with the control wards (p=0.0001). After
controlling for clustering, that is, administrations
occurring in the same ward, and adjusting for ward
type and medication route using the multilevel nega-
tive binomial modelling approach, there remained a
significant reduction in non-medication-related inter-
ruptions on the intervention wards compared with
control wards (a reduction of 15 interruptions/100
administrations; p=0.01). The ICC based on the
model was 0.01.
Of 1177 administrations observed on the postinter-
vention wards, for 92.6% (n=1090) nurses were
observed wearing vests. In 2.0% (n=24), nurses wore
the vest for part of the process and in 5.4% (n=63)
of observations no vest was worn.
On the intervention wards, we observed reductions
in the rates at which nurses administering medications
were interrupted by other nurses (31/100 administra-
tions preintervention to 20/100 postintervention),
particularly with questions about other patients (from
23/100
administrations
preintervention
to
10/100
postintervention) (figure 1). There was a small reduc-
tion in the rate at which nurses were interrupted
to double check a medication for another patient
(figure 1). W
e found reductions in the rates at which
enrolled nurses (preintervention 8/100 administra-
tions; postintervention 3/100) and registered nurses
(preintervention
21/100;
postintervention
15/100)
interrupted other nurses. There was little change in the
rate of interruptions from patients. Postintervention
the rate of non-medication-related interruptions at
both the bedside and in the corridor substantially
decreased on the intervention wards (figure 1).
Changes in overall interruption rates postintervention
In the postintervention period, nurses on the interven-
tion wards experienced a reduction in interruptions
from an average of 56/100 administrations (95% CI
50 to 62) to 38/100 administrations (95% CI 34 to
43). Interruption rates on the control wards experi-
enced little change (59/100 admissions; 95% CI 53 to
64 preintervention vs 57/100; 95% CI 52 to 63 post-
intervention). Without considering the cluster design,
a direct comparison of the change in total interrup-
tion rates between the intervention and control wards
before/after the intervention showed a significant
reduction for the intervention wards relative to the
control wards of 16 interruptions/100 administrations
(p=0.0005). Accounting for the randomised cluster
design, the difference disappeared (p=0.4; a differ-
ence between intervention and control wards of 13
interruptions/100 administrations). After adjusting for
ward type (ie, surgical vs medical) and medication
route, there was no significant difference in the
change in interruption rates before and after the inter-
vention versus control wards (p=0.07; intervention
wards
had
an
average
of
12

 administrations fewer than control wards). An ICC of
0.01 was obtained from the model.
Changes in multitasking rates postintervention
In the postintervention period, nurses on the interven-
tion wards experienced a reduction in multitasking
from an average of 487/100 administrations (95% CI
460 to 513) to 435/100 administrations (95% CI 407
to 463). There was little change in multitasking rates
on the control wards (462/100 administrations in pre-
intervention; 95% CI 436 to 488 vs 470/100; 95%
CI 443 to 497). Without considering the cluster
design, multitasking on the intervention wards signifi-
cantly declined (by 60/100 administrations) compared
with control wards (p=0.02). However, accounting
for the cluster randomised design, this effect disap-
peared (p=0.40). After adjusting for ward type and
medication route, there was no significant change in
multitasking rate on the intervention wards relative to
the control wards (p=0.67).
Survey responses from nurses participating in the study
All 227 nurses who had consented to participate in
the study were invited to complete a survey. In total,
88 nurses completed the survey (44 from intervention
and 44 from control wards), a response rate of 38.8%.
The vast majority strongly agreed or agreed that inter-
ruptions occur frequently (88.6%) are a concern for
patient safety (86.2%) and lead to MAEs (81.6%). W
e
asked nurses to indicate the frequency (on a four-point
scale: frequently, sometimes, rarely, never) with which
interruptions during medication administration arise
from a list of 11 potential sources (eg, nurses, patients,
alarms). The sources nominated most often as fre-
quent interruption sources were as follows: patients
(69.8% of respondents), call buttons (60%), nurses
(51%), relatives (43%) and doctors (25.9%).
W
e asked all nurses about their views of being
observed during the study. The majority (60.2%,
n=53) reported that being observed made no differ-
ence to them. A further 17.0% (n=15) responded
that it made them ‘feel valued and/or important’, and
22.7%
(n=20)
that
being
observed
made
them
‘nervous and/or intimidated’. Overall, 53% (n=24
control wards, n=23 intervention wards) thought that
being observed during the study had made them more
aware of interruptions and 17.1% (n=15) that they
paid more attention to medications. To identify the
extent to which blinding of the intervention was suc-
cessful, we asked nurses on the control wards if they
were aware that ‘Do not interrupt’ vests had been
trialled in the hospital and 29.6% (n=13) reported
that they were aware of this intervention.
Nurses on the intervention wards were asked about
their experiences of the intervention. The vast major-
ity (95.5%; n=39) reported that they wore a vest
during the study when preparing and administering
medications, and 52.3% agreed or strongly agreed
that they thought the intervention was effective at
reducing interruptions. Some (27.3%) thought that
wearing the ‘Do not interrupt’ vest was associated
with an increase in the time taken to administer medi-
cations, while others (20.4%) perceived a decrease
and 40.9% no change.

 The majority of nurses on the intervention wards
agreed or strongly agreed that the vests were too hot
to wear (52.3%) and time consuming to put on and
off (52.3%); 38.6% thought that the vests were
cumbersome.
Across the entire sample, we asked nurses if they
would voluntarily wear the vests if they were provided
(yes/no); 56.8% on the control wards indicated that
they
would
(25%
indicated
no;
18%
did
not
respond), as did 43.2% of those on the intervention
wards (38.6% no; 18% did not respond). Similarly,
when asked if participants would support the wearing
of vests becoming hospital policy 52.3% of nurses on
the control wards and 47.7% on the intervention
wards indicated yes. While nearly all survey partici-
pants responded to all questions, we found that for
these last two yes/no questions 18% (n=16 evenly
split across intervention and control wards) did not
respond;
however,
no
option
was
provided
for
undecided.
DISCUSSION
‘Do not interrupt’ intervention effectiveness overall and
compared with other interventions
Using a parallel cluster randomised controlled study,
we found a significant reduction in non-medication-
related interruptions on the intervention wards com-
pared with the control wards. Thus, the intervention
was effective, but the effect size was modest represent-
ing a 30% reduction in interruptions (of 15 interrup-
tions/100 administrations). This result is consistent
with, but lower than, a range of small, non-controlled
studies that report significant reductions in the overall
rate of interruptions per medication dose administered
of 71%11 44%12 and 43%13 following the introduc-
tion of similar interventions. Our lower effect size
is likely attributable to our more stringent study
design and analysis. Of note is an Italian study7 that
demonstrated a significant increase in overall interrup-
tions of 34%.
A central question is, what is the clinical practical
significance of this reduction in interruptions, particu-
larly on error rate reduction? Drawing on findings
from one of our previous studies1 which involved
observation of 4271 medication administrations by 98
nurses across two teaching hospitals and demonstrated
a significant dose–response relationship between inter-
ruptions and MAEs (n=1196),1 we can shed some
light on this question. That study showed that each
interruption was associated with a 12.7% increase in
the incidence of clinical MAEs. Extrapolating from
this finding, the reduction of 15 interruptions/100
medication administrations found in the current study
would translate to a potential absolute reduction in
clinical MAEs of 1.8% (95% CI 1.1% to 2.7%).
To place this result in context, it is helpful to
consider the effectiveness of alternative interventions
also designed to reduce MAEs. The use of electronic
medication administration records (eMARs) as part of
a Computerised Provider Order Entry system (or
e-prescribing system) is such an intervention. In a con-
trolled before (paper-based medication administration
chart) and after study of the introduction of an eMAR
(with no bar coding) at a major teaching hospital,
W
estbrook and Li14 observed 4176 medication admin-
istrations performed by 153 nurses. At baseline, they
showed the rate of clinical MAEs was 30.2/100
administrations. Following the introduction of the
eMAR, there was a significant reduction in the clinical
error rate of 4.2 errors/100 administrations (ie, a 14%
absolute reduction in the MAE rate). Thus, our ‘Do
not interrupt’ intervention has the potential to reduce
MAEs by 1.8% versus a 14% reduction in MAEs
found
following
implementation
of
an
eMAR.
Clearly, these two interventions are very different and
involve substantially different resources. There are no
published cost-effectiveness studies for either interven-
tion types to guide decisions about their relative
value. However, the contrast in magnitude of overall
effectiveness in reducing MAEs highlights the value of
considering opportunity costs when making decisions
about any such interventions designed to reduce
MAEs.
User acceptability and sustainability of ‘Do not
interrupt’ interventions are further important consid-
erations. Few studies have remarked upon the diffi-
culty in sustaining such interventions beyond the
initial enthusiasm and once monitoring of use disap-
pears.4 6 Results from our survey of nurses identified
a number of practical issues, including the difficulty of
taking vests on and off, and concerns that medication
administrations took longer. In other studies, nurses
have highlighted their discomfort with wearing vests,
as well as potential infection-control concerns with
the reuse of cloth vests.15 The use of external props
such as vests and sashes disrupts nurses’ work and
thus the benefits should be substantial to counter this
interference in workflow. Overall, less than half the
nurses on the intervention wards in our study wanted
to continue with the intervention. Understanding in
greater detail the reasons for interruptions and when
they are most likely to be hazardous and using this
information to better design the workflow have been
suggested as potentially valuable approaches to redu-
cing interruptions without the need for vests.16–18
Such changes may include relocating medication-
related
equipment,
using
barriers
to
keep
those
engaged in medication tasks out of sight of others,
and applying demarcated non-interruption zones for
some tasks.19 20 Educating nurses in strategies to deal
with interruptive clinical environments has also been
advocated.21

 and countries.7 22 23 Investigation of the nature of
these interruptions revealed that the vast majority
(88%) had no relevance to the medication task under-
way. Hence, there would appear to be considerable
scope for reducing the cognitive load of these unre-
lated interruptions. The survey results revealed a high
level of recognition by nurses that interruptions are
frequent and that they are a risk to safety and con-
tributor to medication errors. Thus, convincing nurses
of
the
potential
value
of
reducing
interruptions
appears unlikely to be a major barrier to change. This
highlights the need to understand in more depth the
reasons, context and motivations for the high rates of
interruptions and the role they play in helping and
hindering safe and effective care delivery.
W
e found that our intervention was most effective
at reducing interruptions from other nurses. The
intervention had no substantial impact on the rate at
which patients interrupted nurses, contrary to con-
cerns that have been voiced in the literature that such
interventions may inhibit patients from seeking help
when needed.17 In an interesting study, Palese et al24
investigated patients’ interpretation of three different
messages on ‘Do not interrupt’ vests and found that
regardless
of
the
message,
patients
on
average
expressed only modest agreement in terms of whether
they thought that the do not interrupt message was
directed at them (a mean score of 5.6 on a 10-point
scale; 1=message on vest not at all directed at me,
10=message absolutely directed at me).
W
e found high rates of multitasking by nurses
during medication administration tasks, which were
unaffected by the intervention. The impact of this
workload strategy has been substantially underex-
plored in healthcare and requires further attention
given the deleterious effects of multitasking demon-
strated in experimental studies and simulations such as
those of driver distraction.8 25–27
Methodological issues in observing nurses during
medication administration
W
e investigated several methodological issues related
to the conduct of these types of interventional trials.
W
e demonstrated that the use of a single-blinded
cluster randomised controlled study was feasible and
that blinding regarding the nature of the intervention
for the control ward was relatively successful with
70% of control ward nurses indicating at the end of
the study that they had not been aware of the ‘Do not
interrupt’ vest being trialled.
Direct observation is the most frequent and reliable
method for assessing interruptions, yet there are
always concerns that the process of observing may
influence participants’ behaviours consistent with the
Hawthorne effect. W
e found that the majority of
survey respondents indicated that when observed they
did not feel any different, but around half reported it
made them more aware of interruptions and a small
proportion paid more attention to medication tasks.
Both these later effects are likely to dilute the effect
size of any intervention and further emphasises the
importance of control groups in any study design.
To date, the evidence base has relied almost entirely
on uncontrolled before/after studies of intervention
effectiveness, which have measured changes in overall
interruption rates between wards. Our results showed
that not controlling for clustering by ward can signifi-
cantly affect study conclusions. For example, we
found a significant decrease in overall interruption
rates but once we controlled for clustering this effect
disappeared. No previous study has controlled for
such ward effects demonstrating the importance of
our trial.
There are some study limitations. First, it was con-
ducted in one hospital and despite blinding around
30% of nurses on control wards reported that they
knew that nurses on intervention wards were wearing
vests. This may have influenced their own behaviours
(though control wards did not have access to vests).
Overall, around half of the surveyed nurses indicated
that being observed made them more conscious of
interruptions. Both these potential sources of bias
would have diluted any intervention effects. Second,
we had no detailed information about staffing levels,
and while no large differences were apparent during
the observational sessions we were unable to explicitly
consider this factor in the analyses. Third, the impact
of interruptions on MAEs and potential patient harm
was not assessed in this study. W
e used published data
from studies in similar Australian hospitals to estimate
potential reductions in errors to illustrate the clinical
effect size of the intervention. This approach is sub-
stantially more robust than previous attempts using
incident
reports
to
identify
errors.4
Fourth,
the
response rate to the survey was <40% but was spread
evenly across nurses on the intervention and control
wards.
Overall, these results reinforce the importance of
applying rigorous study designs to assess the effective-
ness of ‘medication safety’ interventions, particularly
those requiring substantial work practice change and
resources. The study of interruptions is complex and
study designs to measure and assess their effects
require equally sophisticated approaches.28 Decisions
about the clinical value of ‘Do not interrupt’ interven-
tions must be made in the context of whether there is
a statistically significant reduction in interruptions and
the potential clinical value of that reduction in rela-
tion to the resources the intervention requires and the
likely
acceptability
and
sustainability
of
the
intervention.
