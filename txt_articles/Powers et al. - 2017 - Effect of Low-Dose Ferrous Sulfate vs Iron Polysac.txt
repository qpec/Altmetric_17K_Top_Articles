IMPORTANCE Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) affects millions of persons worldwide, and is
associated with impaired neurodevelopment in infants and children. Ferrous sulfate is the
most commonly prescribed oral iron despite iron polysaccharide complex possibly being
better tolerated.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of ferrous sulfate with iron polysaccharide complex on
hemoglobin concentration in infants and children with nutritional IDA.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blind, superiority randomized clinical trial of
infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with nutritional IDA (assessed by history and
laboratory criteria) that was conducted in an outpatient hematology clinic at a US tertiary
care hospital from September 2013 through November 2015; 12-week follow-up ended
in January 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Three mg/kg of elemental iron once daily as either ferrous sulfate drops or
iron polysaccharide complex drops for 12 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was change in hemoglobin over 12 weeks.
Secondary outcomes included complete resolution of IDA (defined as hemoglobin
concentration >11 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume >70 fL, reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent
>25 pg, serum ferritin level >15 ng/mL, and total iron-binding capacity <425 μg/dL at the
12-week visit), changes in serum ferritin level and total iron-binding capacity, adverse effects.
RESULTS Of 80 randomized infants and children (median age, 22 months; 55% male; 61%
Hispanic white; 40 per group), 59 completed the trial (28 [70%] in ferrous sulfate group; 31
[78%] in iron polysaccharide complex group). From baseline to 12 weeks, mean hemoglobin
increased from 7.9 to 11.9 g/dL (ferrous sulfate group) vs 7.7 to 11.1 g/dL (iron complex group),
a greater difference of 1.0 g/dL (95% CI, 0.4 to 1.6 g/dL; P < .001) with ferrous sulfate (based
on a linear mixed model). Proportion with a complete resolution of IDA was higher in the
ferrous sulfate group (29% vs 6%; P = .04). Median serum ferritin level increased from 3.0 to
15.6 ng/mL (ferrous sulfate) vs 2.0 to 7.5 ng/mL (iron complex) over 12 weeks, a greater
difference of 10.2 ng/mL (95% CI, 6.2 to 14.1 ng/mL; P < .001) with ferrous sulfate. Mean total
iron-binding capacity decreased from 501 to 389 μg/dL (ferrous sulfate) vs 506 to 417 μg/dL
(iron complex) (a greater difference of −50 μg/dL [95% CI, −86 to −14 μg/dL] with ferrous
sulfate; P < .001). There were more reports of diarrhea in the iron complex group than in the
ferrous sulfate group (58% vs 35%, respectively; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with
nutritional iron-deficiency anemia, ferrous sulfate compared with iron polysaccharide complex
resulted in a greater increase in hemoglobin concentration at 12 weeks. Once daily, low-dose
ferrous sulfate should be considered for children with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia.

ron-deficiency anemia (IDA) affected more than 1 billion
persons worldwide in 2010,1,2 including up to 3% of chil-
dren aged 1 to 2 years in the United States.3-5 The most com-
mon cause of IDA in infants and young children is inadequate
dietary iron intake resulting from excessive cow milk con-
sumption, prolonged breastfeeding without appropriate iron
supplementation, or both. It typically occurs in infants and
young children when rapid growth outstrips availability of di-
etaryiron.Consequencesincludeirritability,malaise,pica,and
bothshort-andlong-termneurodevelopmentalimpairment.6-8
Successful treatment of IDA requires recognition and cor-
rectionoftheunderlyingetiologyaccompaniedbyironreplace-
ment therapy to normalize the hemoglobin concentration and
replenishironstores.Treatmentfailureiscommonduetomedi-
cation nonadherence, adverse effects related to excessive dos-
ing, and lack of evidence-based management guidelines.9 Few
randomized clinical trials inform the selection of iron prepara-
tion, dosage schedule, and duration of therapy, irrespective of
the underlying etiology, age, or sex of affected individuals.10,11
In infants and young children, standard dosing recommenda-
tionsare2to6mg/kg/dofelementalirongivenfrom1to3times
daily for a duration of 3 to 6 months.12 The literature on adults
suggests that lower therapeutic dosing strategies may be suffi-
cient for successful treatment.13,14
Dozens of oral iron preparations (most of them over-
the-counter supplements) are available for IDA treatment.
Ferrous sulfate, an iron salt, is the standard and most com-
monly used agent to treat nutritional IDA.15,16 Alternatively,
ironpolysaccharidecomplexpreparationscontainingferriciron
may be prescribed due to their potentially improved tolerabil-
ity and better taste. Given the high prevalence of IDA in infants
andyoungchildren,thisdouble-blind,randomizedclinicaltrial
was designed to investigate whether an iron polysaccharide
complex agent was more efficacious than ferrous sulfate in
increasing hemoglobin concentration in infants and children
aged 9 to 48 months with nutritional IDA.
Methods
The BESTIRON study was a randomized, double-blind single-
center superiority trial designed to compare the efficacy of an
iron polysaccharide complex (NovaFerrum, Gensavis Phar-
maceuticals LLC) vs ferrous sulfate for the treatment of nutri-
tional IDA in infants and young children who were referred for
care at the Children’
s Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.
The institutional review board at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center approved the study. Written in-
formed consent was obtained from the parents of each partici-
pant prior to enrollment. The study was performed and ana-
lyzed in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of
ReportingTrials.ThetrialstartdatewasSeptember3,2013,and
itcontinuedthroughNovember5,2015.Thefinalfollow-update
was January 28, 2016. A single protocol modification regard-
ing inclusion of laboratory criteria was made prior to the en-
rollment of any patients and formal institutional review board
approval was received the day after the first patient was en-
rolled. The study protocol appears in Supplement 1.
Eligible patients were infants and children aged 9 to 48
months with a diagnosis of nutritional IDA resulting from ex-
cessive cow milk intake of greater than 720 mL per day, breast-
feeding without iron supplementation, or both. Given that ra-
cialandethnicminoritygroupsaredisproportionatelyaffected
by IDA, this information was collected and reported for all pa-
tients. Data were obtained from the electronic medical rec-
ord, which contains self-reported racial and ethnic identifica-
tion based on fixed categories. Iron-deficiency anemia was
confirmed by the following hematologic indices: hemoglobin
concentration of 10 g/dL or less, mean corpuscular volume of
70 fL or less, reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent of 25 pg or
less, and either serum ferritin level of 15 ng/mL or less or total
iron-binding capacity of 425 μg/dL or greater.
Patients were excluded from enrollment if they had clini-
cal or laboratory evidence of other causes of anemia (entire list
of eligibility criteria appears in eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Receipt of a packed red blood cell transfusion for severe symp-
tomatic anemia at presentation did not exclude enrollment. All
patients who received a transfusion had repeat hematologic in-
dices assessed after the transfusion to ensure eligibility.
Enrolled patients were randomized with a 1:1 allocation to
receive either oral ferrous sulfate drops (15 mg/mL) or oral iron
polysaccharidecomplexdrops(15mg/mL).Randomizationwas
stratified by degree of anemia (hemoglobin concentration
≥8.0 g/dL vs <8.0 g/dL). Within each stratum, patients were
randomly assigned to either experimental group with a 1:1
allocation by a computer-generated randomization schedule
using permuted blocks of 4.
Allocationconcealmentoccurredaftereachparticipantwas
formally enrolled in the trial, and all baseline measurements
(history, physical examination, laboratory assessment) were
completed. Implementation of the sequence generation and
allocation concealment mechanism was performed by an in-
vestigational pharmacist who had no direct contact with study
patients.Trialinvestigatorsperformedenrollmentandallstudy
procedures after randomization. Except for the investiga-
tionalpharmacist,themembersofthestudyteamwereblinded
to treatment allocation.
Patients were prescribed a single daily dose of 3 mg/kg of
elemental iron administered via oral syringe by the parents or
caregiver at bedtime. Daily doses were rounded up to the near-
est 0.5 mL. Parents or caregivers were asked not to adminis-
ter other iron-containing preparations and instructed not to
Key Points
Question Is iron polysaccharide complex more effective than
ferrous sulfate in improving the hemoglobin concentration in infants
and young children with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia?
Findings In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial that
included 80 patients, those who received ferrous sulfate for
12 weeks had a 1.0 g/dL greater increase in hemoglobin
concentration than those receiving iron polysaccharide complex.
Meaning Among infants and young children with nutritional
iron-deficiency anemia, ferrous sulfate compared with iron
polysaccharide complex resulted in a greater increase in
hemoglobin concentration at 12 weeks.

 mix the study medication with any food or drink and specifi-
cally to avoid milk intake within 1 hour of administering the
study medication. Nutritional counseling about the need to re-
duce cow milk intake to a maximum of 600 mL per day was
provided. A daily diary with the dosing instructions was given
to parents or caregivers at each visit to record medication ad-
ministration and adverse effects.
Subsequentoutpatientstudyvisitswerescheduledatweeks
4, 8, and 12 after enrollment to review between-interval his-
tory and perform laboratory testing (complete blood count, re-
ticulocytecount,reticulocytehemoglobinequivalent,serumfer-
ritin level, serum iron level, total iron-binding capacity, and
blood lead level [the latter performed during week 4 only]).
Treatmentfailurewasdefinedasahemoglobinincrementofless
than 0.5 g/dL above the baseline concentration at week 8. The
final visit at week 12 involved a comprehensive history, includ-
ing whether the study drug had been mixed with other liquids
or foods. Adverse effects were assessed every 2 weeks via tele-
phone contact and at clinic visits. At each follow-up visit, re-
turned medication bottles were submitted to the investiga-
tional pharmacy and the volume of unused study medication
was measured. Further details regarding adverse effect assess-
ment appear in the eMethods in Supplement 2.
The primary outcome was the change in hemoglobin con-
centration during the 12 weeks after initiation of oral iron
therapy. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of pa-
tients with complete resolution of IDA (defined as hemoglo-
bin concentration >11 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume >70 fL,
reticulocytehemoglobinequivalent>25pg,serumferritinlevel
>15 ng/mL, and total iron-binding capacity <425 μg/dL at the
12-week visit), changes in other iron laboratory measures, ad-
verse effects, lost to follow-up rates, resolution of IDA signs
and symptoms, and medication adherence as measured by pa-
tient diary entries and returned medication volume.
Estimates for baseline mean hemoglobin concentration of
7.8 g/dL (SD, 1.5 g/dL) were derived from data on new pa-
tients with IDA seen at the Children’
s Medical Center outpa-
tient hematology clinic during the preceding 4½-year period.9
We hypothesized that at the time of study completion there
would be a 1-g/dL between-group difference in the mean he-
moglobin concentration values (ferrous sulfate: 11 g/dL; iron
polysaccharide complex: 12 g/dL). The effect size of 1 g/dL was
chosen as a clinically significant difference based on an analy-
sis of studies evaluating IDA and neurocognitive outcomes by
the World Health Organization and work examining the rela-
tionship between serum ferritin level and hemoglobin con-
centration in young children.17,18 We assumed a within-
patient correlation of 0.25. Using a linear mixed model and
assuming a lost to follow-up rate of 25%,9 the accrual goal was
40 patients per group (80 total) to allow for a 2-sided type I
error of .05 at 80% power.
We hypothesized that iron polysaccharide complex would
result in a greater hematologic response compared with fer-
rous sulfate as measured by change in hemoglobin concentra-
tion over 12 weeks. The primary analysis consisted of a linear
mixed regression model in an intention-to-treat population.
It included treatment and time as covariates and patient ran-
domeffectstoaccountforcorrelationamonglongitudinalmea-
surements from the same patients. The linear mixed model
readily accommodates missing data so imputation for miss-
ing data was not performed.19 Changes in other continuous
measures were modeled with a similar linear mixed regres-
sion method. The generalized estimation equation approach
was used to estimate model parameters, which accommo-
dates incomplete data and is robust against deviation from the
normality assumption.
The χ2 test was used to compare categorical outcomes, in-
cluding the proportion of patients with a complete response,
dropouts, adverse effects, and adherence measures. The per-
centage volume of unused study medication returned at each
visit was compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. All tests
were 2-sided with a significance level of .05. Adjustment for
multiple comparisons of secondary end points was not per-
formed. Inference about secondary outcomes should be in-
terpreted as exploratory. A post hoc between-group compari-
sonoftheproportionofpatientswhocomplainedofabdominal
pain, constipation, vomiting, and diarrhea (combined gastro-
intestinal adverse effect profile) also was conducted using the
χ2 test. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc).

 Secondary Outcomes
The 59 patients who completed all study visits (28 in the fer-
rous sulfate group and 31 in the iron polysaccharide complex
group) were analyzed for the predefined complete resolution
of IDA (Table 2), which occurred in a larger proportion of pa-
tients receiving ferrous sulfate (29%, n = 8) compared with
those receiving iron polysaccharide complex (6%, n = 2)
(P = .04). There were no significant between-group differ-
ences in iron measurements at baseline.
The median serum ferritin level increased from 3.0 ng/mL
to 15.6 ng/mL in the ferrous sulfate group compared with an
increase from 2.0 ng/mL to 7.5 ng/mL in the iron polysaccha-
ride complex group over 12 weeks (a greater difference of 10.2
ng/mL[95%CI,6.2to14.1ng/mL]withferroussulfate,P < .001;
Table 3). The mean total iron-binding capacity decreased from
501 μg/dL to 389 μg/dL in the ferrous sulfate group compared
with a decrease from 506 μg/dL to 417 μg/dL in the iron poly-
saccharide complex group over 12 weeks (a greater difference
of −50 μg/dL [95% CI, −86 to −14 μg/dL] with ferrous sulfate,
P < .001; Table 3).
Adverse Effects and Events
Theadverseeffectprofilesdemonstratedsignificantlymorepar-
ent reports of diarrhea with iron polysaccharide complex
(Table 4). More parent reports of vomiting were made in the
ferrous sulfate group; however, this difference was not statis-
tically significant. A combined post hoc gastrointestinal ad-
verseeffectprofile(abdominalpain,constipation,vomiting,and
diarrhea) showed no significant between-group differences.
One patient receiving ferrous sulfate experienced a transient
episode of methemoglobinemia of unknown cause during
week 4. The patient was successfully treated with methylene
blue and continued in the study without recurrence.

lution of pallor that were not significantly different (Table 2).
None of the patients had an elevated blood lead level at the
week 4 study visit.
Medication Adherence
Parents reported more successful administration of all indi-
vidual iron doses (ie, the child not spitting out the medica-
tion) with iron polysaccharide complex (94% vs 82% in the
ferrous sulfate group; P = .009). There were no other signifi-

Via patient diaries, 78% of families reported missing no doses
of iron polysaccharide complex compared with 53% of fami-
lies in the ferrous sulfate group (P = .12).
Fifty percent of parents reported difficulty with ad-
ministration of iron polysaccharide complex at any point
in the study compared with 65% in the ferrous sulfate
group (P = .17; Table 4). Returned medication volume indi-
cated no significant difference in adherence with iron poly-
saccharide complex compared with ferrous sulfate. As a
marker of difficulty with medication administration, there
was no significant difference in the proportion of parents
who reported mixing the iron preparation with juice or food
(Table 2).

 Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial of infants and children aged 9
to 48 months with nutritional IDA treated at a single aca-
demicmedicalcenter,ferroussulfatedropscomparedwithiron
polysaccharide complex drops resulted in a greater increase
in hemoglobin concentration at 12 weeks. Studies of neuro-
cognitive outcomes in children with IDA17 have demon-
strated the clinical importance of the between-group differ-
ence in hemoglobin concentration of 1 g/dL found in this trial.
Among the secondary outcomes, the proportion of pa-
tients with a complete resolution of IDA (ie, no further iron
therapyrequired)washigherintheferroussulfategroup.Simi-
lar to the primary outcome, changes in iron indices favored the
ferrous sulfate group. More parent reports of diarrhea were
made in the iron polysaccharide complex group but no other
significant differences in adverse effects were found. Pa-
tients were more likely to ingest the iron polysaccharide com-
plex during administration compared with ferrous sulfate, but
there were otherwise no significant between-group differ-
ences in the lost to follow-up rates, resolution of IDA symp-
toms, or medication adherence.
Iron salts have long been used for the treatment of IDA,
with ferrous sulfate being the most common choice in per-
sons of all ages.16,20 Reports of poor taste and gastrointesti-
naladverseeffectsoftenresultintherecommendationofother
iron salts (eg, ferrous gluconate and fumarate) or iron poly-
saccharide complex preparations.16,21,22 In the current trial, an
iron polysaccharide complex agent developed specifically to
have improved taste and tolerability was hypothesized to pro-
mote a more effective hematologic response. Although both
preparations were effective and well-tolerated, ferrous sul-
fate resulted in a greater increase in hemoglobin concentra-
tion and improved diverse measures of iron homeostasis.
Previous radioisotope studies have demonstrated more ef-
fective use of iron when administered in the form of medici-
nal iron in contrast to iron-fortified foods.23 Small studies in
adults suggest that bivalent salts such as ferrous sulfate are
moreeffectivelyabsorbedthantrivalentones.24,25Limiteddata
from prior studies suggest improved absorption with ferrous
sulfate compared with iron polysaccharide complexes.24,25
A small case series by Diamond et al26 compared a palatable
iron carbohydrate complex with ferrous sulfate, and the lat-
ter resulted in a more rapid hemoglobin concentration in-
crease over 3 weeks.
Oral iron absorption tests were conducted and those pa-
tientsreceivingferroussulfatedemonstratedamarkedlyhigher
increase in serum iron, supporting the notion of more effec-
tive absorption. Therefore, this trial failed to demonstrate the
original hypothesis that iron polysaccharide complex would
be more effective than ferrous sulfate, likely due to more ef-
fective absorption of the latter.
Recommendedtherapeuticdosingofelementalironinchil-
dren ranges widely from 2 to 6 mg/kg/d administered from 1
to 3 times daily.12 In this trial, a daily iron dose at the lower end
of the recommended range (3 mg/kg of elemental iron) ad-
ministered just once daily, at bedtime, and on an empty stom-
ach was chosen. Two prior randomized clinical trials in
children10,11 informed this minimalist strategy aimed to en-
hance adherence and limit adverse effects. One trial10 com-
paredoncedailyferroussulfate(3mg/kgofelementaliron)with
placebo in infants aged 12 months and demonstrated no sig-
nificant differences in adverse gastrointestinal effects. The
other trial11 conducted in rural Ghana documented similar suc-
cess rates in correcting anemia when ferrous sulfate was ad-
ministered once or 3 times daily. Recommendations based pri-
marily on expert opinion from the US Centers for Disease
ControlandPreventionandtheWorldHealthOrganizationhave
endorsed low-dose, once daily iron therapy.27,28
Studies involving adults with IDA also support the use of
low-dose oral iron treatment. In 1 trial,14 octogenarians with
anemia were randomized to 15 mg, 50 mg, or 150 mg of fer-
rous salts (gluconate or citrate) administered once daily and
had virtually identical hematologic responses, but there were
far less gastrointestinal toxic effects in the group receiving
15 mg. A study in women with iron deficiency using stable iron
isotopes demonstrated that a single dose of iron engendered
a prompt increase in serum hepcidin level that resulted in
markedlyreducedabsorptionofsubsequentirondoses12hours
or even 24 hours later.13 Taken together, these findings sug-
gest that once daily low-dose iron therapy might result in
greater fractional absorption of iron in lieu of multiple doses
of iron each day.13,29
Unlike nearly all prior therapeutic studies of oral iron
agents, this trial was designed as a double-blind, randomized
clinical trial. In concert with other literature,13,14 these re-
sults should help stimulate the conduct of further clinical trials
evaluating lower or less frequent dosing of oral iron. Antici-
pated outcomes might include improved patient adherence as
well as enhanced iron absorption leading to a more favorable
hematologic response.
Limitations
The trial has several limitations. First, it was conducted at a
single tertiary care children’
s hospital. Second, there were a
disproportionate number of lower income and minority pa-
tientswhoseanemiawasoftensevere,withapproximately23%
requiring a blood transfusion prior to enrollment. Third, the
trialhadalosttofollow-uprateof25%atthefinal12-weekvisit.
Fourth, these results may not be generalizable to the general
pediatric population due to the strict monitoring involved in
a clinical trial compared with standard community practice.
Yet by choosing to use a simplified dosing regimen, the goal
was to create a practical treatment strategy that could im-
prove outcomes even when applied in a clinical setting.
Conclusions
Among infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with nutri-
tional iron-deficiency anemia, ferrous sulfate compared with
iron polysaccharide complex resulted in a greater increase in
hemoglobin concentration at 12 weeks. Once daily, low-dose
ferrous sulfate should be considered for children with nutri-
tional iron-deficiency anemia.
