background A previous meta-analysis showed 
that maximal oxygen uptake increased by 3.51 mL/
kg/min (95% CI 3.07 to 4.15) during a recreational 
football programme of 3–6 months in comparison with 
continuous moderate-intensity running, strength training 
or a passive control group. In addition, narrative reviews 
have demonstrated beneficial effects of recreational 
football on physical fitness and health status.
Objective The purpose of this systematic review 
and meta-analysis was to evaluate the magnitude of 
effects of recreational football on blood pressure, body 
composition, lipid profile and muscular fitness with 
reference to age, gender and health status.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources MEDLINE, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of 
Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature (CINAHL) and Google Scholar were searched 
prior to 1 February 2017. In addition, Google Scholar 
alerts were set up in January 2012 to identify potential 
papers with the following key terms: recreational 
football, recreational soccer, street football and street 
soccer.
Eligibility criteria for selecting 
studies Randomised and matched controlled trials 
with participants allocated to a recreational football 
group or any other type of exercises or passive control 
group were included. Training programmes had to last at 
least 2 weeks to meet the inclusion criteria. The primary 
outcome measures were blood pressure, resting heart 
rate, body composition, muscular fitness, and blood lipids 
and glucose tolerance. A total of 31 papers met the 
inclusion criteria and were included.
Results The effect of recreational football on systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) versus no-exercise controls was 
most likely extremely largely beneficial (effect size 
(ES)=4.20 mm Hg; 95% CI 1.87 to 6.53). In addition, a 
most likely very large beneficial (ES=3.89 mm Hg; 95% CI 
2.33 to 5.44) effect was observed for diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP), when compared with non-active groups. 
Furthermore, a most likely extremely large beneficial 
effect was shown for SBP and DBP in participants 
with mild hypertension (11 and 7 mm Hg decrease, 
respectively) and participants with prehypertension (10 
and 7 mm Hg decrease, respectively). Meta-analysis 
of recreational football determined the impact on 
resting heart rate as most likely extremely largely 
beneficial (ES=6.03 beats/min; 95% CI 4.43 to 7.64) 
when compared with non-active groups. The observed 
recreational football effect on fat mass was most likely 
largely beneficial (ES=1.72 kg; 95% CI 0.86 to 2.58) and 
the effect on countermovement jump (CMJ) performance 
was most likely very largely beneficial (ES=2.27 cm; 
95% CI 1.29 to 3.25) when compared with non-active 
groups. Possibly beneficial decreases were found in 
low-density lipoprotein levels (ES=0.21 mmol/L; 95% CI 
0.06 to 0.36). Possibly largely beneficial effect was 
observed for DBP in comparison with continuous running 
training. Small harmful and unclear results were noted 
for SBP, fat and lean body mass, body mass index, as well 
as muscular fitness when compared with running and 
Zumba training.
Conclusion The present meta-analysis demonstrated 
multiple broad-spectrum benefits of recreational 
football on health-related physical fitness compared 
with no-exercise controls, including improvements 
in blood pressure, resting heart rate, fat mass, low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol and CMJ performance. 
Additionally, recreational football is efficient and 
effective as Zumba and continuous running exercise 
regimens with highlighted social, motivational and 
competitive components.
InTRODuCTIOn
It is now well established that physical fitness is a 
strong mortality predictor and that physical training 
is a cornerstone in the prevention and treatment 
of lifestyle diseases including hypertension, type 2 
diabetes and osteoporosis.1–4 Conventional training 
approaches such as high-intensity interval training, 
endurance running and strength training are well 
known to be effective in improving cardiovascular, 
metabolic and musculoskeletal fitness, respec-
tively.5–8 However, participation in multifaceted 
exercise training may be effective in simultaneously 
stimulating all three main fitness areas, thereby 
providing broad-spectrum fitness and health bene-
fits.2–5 Over the last decade, there has been growing 
evidence that recreational football is precisely 
this type of multifaceted exercise training. Small-
sided football training for untrained health adults 
across the lifespan as well as several patient groups 
have been shown to elicit average heart rates of 
80%–85% of maximal heart rate (HRmax) during 
60 
min sessions, with 15%–50% of total training 
time in the highest aerobic training zone above 90% 
HRmax.6 In addition, small-sided football training 
comprises multiple strength training elements, with 
more than 100 high-intensity runs and hundreds 
of specific intense actions such as dribbles, shots, 
tackles, turns and jumps in 60 
min training sessions.7 
Many individual studies have reported recreational

football to be an effective type of physical activity with positive 
effects on hypertension in middle-aged men8 and women,9 on 
cardiovascular and metabolic responses in patients with type 2 
diabetes,10 on heart function,11 on physical capacity,12 on muscle 
mass in patients with prostate cancer11 and on bone mineral 
density and mass,13 with positive effects in various age categories 
and populations on cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular fitness, 
health profile and physical capacity,5 and three narrative reviews 
have confirmed the effects of recreational football training on 
cardiovascular, metabolic and musculoskeletal fitness regard-
less of age and health status.9 10 14 To date, only two systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated the effects of recre-
ational football, and these had a predominant focus on aerobic 
fitness. Milanović and colleagues6 meta-analysed 17 studies and 
reported that recreational football produces large improvements 
in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) compared with 
strength training and no-exercise controls, while a moderate 
effect size (ES) was observed in comparison with continuous 
endurance running. Likewise, Oja et al15 showed significant 
positive effects on maximal oxygen consumption and resting 
heart rate (RHR) compared with a no-exercise control, with 
borderline significance for fat percentage. The effects of recre-
ational football on broad-spectrum fitness and health benefits, 
however, have yet to be meta-analysed.
The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was 
therefore to carry an up-to-date evaluation of the broad-spec-
trum health-related fitness effects of recreational football 
training in relation to age and health status, with a specific focus 
on the magnitude of effects on (1) blood pressure, (2) RHR, (3) 
body composition, (4) muscular fitness evaluated as jump perfor-
mance, and (5) blood lipids and glucose tolerance.

search strategy and study selection
The search and study selection strategy applied in this system-
atic review and meta-analysis was similar to that of a previous 
published paper by Milanović et al.6 All procedures relevant 
for papers’ identification were carried out in accordance with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.16 Computerised literature 
searches were conducted on the following databases: MEDLINE, 
PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to 
Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Google 
Scholar. A structured search included papers published prior to 
1 February 2017. In addition, Google Scholar alerts were set up 
in January 2012 to identify potential papers with the following 
key terms: recreational football, recreational soccer, street foot-
ball and street soccer. A manual search was performed covering 
the areas of recreational football/soccer, recreational physical 
activity, recreational small-sided games and physical fitness using 
the following key terms and strings, either singly or in combi-
nation: (‘recreational small-sided games’ (All Fields) OR ‘recre-
ational football’ (All Fields) OR ‘recreational soccer’ (All Fields) 
OR ‘street football’ (All Fields) or ‘street soccer’ (All Fields)) 
AND (‘effect’ (All Fields) OR ‘impact’ (All Fields) OR ‘influence’ 
(All Fields)) AND (‘physical fitness’ (Mesh) OR ‘health status’ 
(Mesh) OR ‘blood pressure’ (Mesh) OR ‘countermovement 
jump’ (Mesh) OR ‘CMJ’ (Mesh) OR ‘body composition’ (Mesh) 
OR ‘body mass index’ (Mesh) OR ‘lean body mass’ (Mesh) OR 
‘body mass’ (Mesh) OR ‘resting heart rate’ (Mesh) OR ‘blood 
lipid’ (Mesh) OR ‘glucose tolerance’ (Mesh)) AND (‘randomised 
controlled trial’ (All fields) OR ‘randomized controlled trial’ 
(Publication T
ype)).
The study selection process is shown in figure 1. T
wo indepen-
dent reviewers (ZM and NČ) performed the literature search, 
identification, screening, quality assessment and data extraction. 
First, the titles were initially screened by the reviewers during the 
electronic searches to assess suitability of papers, and all papers 
beyond the scope of this meta-analysis were excluded. Second, 
abstracts were assessed using predetermined inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria. Third, the full texts of the remaining papers that 
met the inclusion criteria were retrieved for inclusion in the 
ongoing procedure and reviewed by the two reviewers to reach 
a final decision on inclusion in the meta-analysis. Finally, refer-
ence lists from retrieved manuscripts were also examined for any 
other potentially eligible papers. Any disagreements between the 
reviewers were resolved by consensus or arbitration by a third 
reviewer (GS). If full text of any paper was not available, the 
corresponding author was contacted by mail or ResearchGate. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered study charac-
teristics and report characteristics (table 1).
Type of study and participants
Randomised and matched controlled trials were included in 
meta-analysis without any restriction on age and health status 
of participants.
Type of interventions
Training programmes had to last at least 2 
weeks, with partici-
pants allocated to a recreational football group and any other 
type of exercise or a passive control group. Studies with unbal-
anced diet in groups were excluded from analysis.
Type of outcome measure
The primary outcome measures for the meta-analysis were blood 
pressure, RHR, body composition, muscular fitness evaluated as 
jump performance, and blood lipids and glucose tolerance.
Data extraction
The Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group’s 
standardised protocol for data extraction was used to extract (1) 
study characteristics including author(s), title and year of publica-
tion; (2) participant information such as sample size, age, health 
status and gender; (3) description of the training intervention, 
including types of exercise, intensity, duration and frequency; 
and (4) study outcomes, including the following physical fitness 
components: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, RHR, body 
mass, body mass index (BMI), lean body mass (LBM), fat mass, 
and metabolic responses including low-density and high-density 
lipoproteins (LDL and HDL), total cholesterol, triglycerides, 
fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance, and muscular 
fitness (see supplementary file 1 and supplementary file 2). 
When needed, pre-BMI and post-BMI values were manually 
calculated. In most of the studies, mean and SD (also computed 
when dispersion was expressed as SEM) prevalues and postvalues 
were reported, while correlation was not reported. Accordingly, 
in these instances the correlation value was set at 0.5, as used 
previously by Bacon et al.17 Graph digitiser software (Digiti-
zeIt, Braunschweig, Germany) was used to obtain data values 
in studies where only plots were published. Data extraction was 
undertaken by ZM, while NČ checked the extracted data for 
accuracy and completeness. Disagreements were resolved by 
consensus or by GS. The reviewers were not blinded to authors, 
institutions or manuscript journals. The summary of findings 
with appropriate quality of evidence table was created using 
the Grading of  Recommendations, Assessment, Development

Review
and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.18 The methodological 
criteria were dependent on five primary domains (risk of bias, 
inconsistency, indirectness, precision and publication bias), as 
well as the overall quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low 
or very low).
Assessment of risk of bias
Risk of bias was evaluated according to the PRISMA recommen-
dation.19 Physiotherapy Evidence Database(PEDro) scale was 
used to determine the quality of the studies and potential risk 
of bias. T
wo independent reviewers assessed the quality and risk 
of bias using checklists. Agreement between the two reviewers 
was assessed using k statistics for full-text screening and rating 
of relevance and risk of bias. In the event of disagreement about 
the risk of bias, the third reviewer checked the data and took 
the final decision on it. The k agreement rate between reviewers 
was k=0.94.
statistical analysis
Difference in means and 95% CIs were calculated for the 
included studies. The I2 measure of inconsistency was used to 
examine between-study variability, with values greater than 
50% considered indicative of high heterogeneity.20 This statistic, 
expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100, can be interpreted 
as the percentage of heterogeneity in the system or, basically, 
the amount of total variation accounted for by the between-
studies variance.21 Publication bias was assessed by examining 
asymmetry of funnel plots using Egger’s test, and P<0.10 
was 
considered a significant publication bias. Pooled estimates of the 
effect of recreational football on blood pressure, RHR, body

composition, metabolic responses and muscular fitness using ES 
were obtained using random-effects models. ES values were clas-
sified as follows: <0.2 
trivial, 0.2–0.6 small, 0.6–1.2 moderate, 
1.2–2.0 large, and >2.0 
very large and >4.0 
extremely large.22 
The precision of the pooled effect was reported as a 95% CI 
and as probabilities that the true value of the effect was trivial, 
beneficial or harmful in relation to threshold values for benefit 
and harm. The chance of the true effect being trivial, benefi-
cial or harmful was then interpreted using the following scale: 
25%–75%, possibly; 75%–95%, likely; 95%–99.5%, very likely; 
and >99.5%, most likely.17 These probabilities were then used 
to make a qualitative probabilistic inference about the overall 
effect.21 Five moderator variables with appropriate levels 
were selected for additional analysis of all outcomes: (1) type 
of control group (no-exercise, continuous running, strength 
training and Zumba groups); (2) gender (male and female); (3) 
age (18–45, 45–65 or >65 
years); (4) length of training inter-
vention (≤12 
weeks and >12 
weeks); and (5) training frequency 
(≤2 
weeks and >2 
weeks). In addition, the type of hyperten-
sion was used as a moderator for systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) outcome where levels were 
normotensive, mild-hypertensive and hypertensive. All statistical 
analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-analysis 
V
.2 software (Biostat, Englewood, New Jersey, USA). P<0.05 
was 
considered statistically significant.

study selection and characteristics
A total of 712 papers were identified across the databases in the 
initial search and an additional 64 papers were selected on the 
basis of their references. After duplications were removed, 342 
papers remained. Based on a screening of the title and abstract, 
278 articles were discarded (195 excluded after title analysis, 
83 excluded after abstract analysis). The full text of the 64 
remaining papers was assessed in more detail for eligibility. Each 
paper was carefully read and coded for study characteristics, 
participant information, description of the training interven-
tion and study outcomes. Thirty-three papers did not meet the 
inclusion criteria, while 31 papers that met the inclusion criteria 
were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. There 
were 17, 15, 19 and 10 papers included in the meta-analysis of 
blood pressure, RHR, body composition and muscular fitness, 
respectively (table 2). Additionally, 10 papers were included for 
metabolic response comparisons (table 3).
All eligible studies were controlled trials, published in 
English from the beginning of 2009 until February 2017. 
In order to perform meta-analysis from 31 papers that met 
the inclusion criteria, 17 studies5 8 9 23–36 featured data changes

plasma LDL and HDL,5 9 10 24–26 30 31 35 45 8 studies for plasma 
triglycerides,9 10 24–26 30 35 45 9 for total cholesterol5 9 10 24–26 30 35 45

tolerance10 12 24 30 31 35 (figure 1).
Football training intervention
Recreational football training interventions were composed of 
a 10–15 
min warm-up period followed by competitive game 
formats of 4 vs 4, 5 vs 5, 6 vs 6, 7 vs 7, and 9 vs 9 without 
specific tasks. Pitch dimensions ranged from 20×30 
m to 
45×65 
m covered with grass and artificial grass surfaces or 
asphalt as well as indoor surfaces. Authors did not report the 
playing role of the goalkeeper or the specific rules used during 
matches. All subjects trained for between 10 and 72 
weeks. The 
most common intervention periods were 12 
weeks2 5 11 23 24 27 29 41 
and 16 
weeks.12 28 37 Total time in the high aerobic intensity zone 
(>90% 
HRmax) ranged from one-tenth to one-third of overall 
exercise time.
study outcomes for blood pressure
The meta-analysed effects of recreational football on SBP and 
DBP were similar (table 4). The recreational football effect on 
SBP when compared with no-exercises controls was most likely 
extremely largely beneficial. A most likely extremely large benefi-
cial (ES=3.89 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI 2.33 to 5.44) effect on DBP was 
observed for recreational football compared with no-exercise 
groups. A most likely extremely large beneficial ES was observed 
in the group of participants with mild hypertension (decrease 
of 10.8 and 6.8 
mm Hg for SBP and DBP in football group and 
4 and 0 
mm Hg in controls). In the prehypertensive group, the 
observed effects were most likely extremely largely beneficial 
(ES=5.52 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI 3.51 to 7.54; decrease of 7.3 and 
2.0 
mm Hg for football group and controls) and likely extremely 
largely beneficial (ES=4.36 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI 0.02 to 8.70; 
decrease of 9.5 and 4.7 
mm Hg for football group and controls) 
for DBP and SBP
. In the normotensive group, the observed 
effects were possibly largely beneficial for both SBP and DBP 
(ES=1.80 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI −0.04 to 3.65 and ES=1.21 
mm Hg; 
95% 
CI −0.11 to 2.32).
When the results were analysed separately for men and 
women, the meta-analysed effect of recreational football on SBP 
was possibly very largely beneficial and very likely extremely 
largely beneficial for men and women (ES=2.25 
mm Hg; 95%

0.21 to 4.30 and ES=4.17 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI 1.15 to 7.19, respec-
tively). For the DBP results the evidence was stronger for an 
effect in men than in women, with most likely very large benefi-
cial effects for men (ES=3.98 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI 2.32 to 5.64) and 
likely very large beneficial effects for women (ES=2.28 
mm Hg; 
95% 
CI 0.82 to 3.75). When a comparison of recreational 
football effects was performed for the age groups, most likely 
extremely large beneficial and most likely very large beneficial 
effects were noted in the 45–65 age group for both SDP and 
DBP
, as well as for the likely very large beneficial effects for DBP 
in the 18–45 age group. In the 18–45 and +65 groups, the effects 
were unclear for SBP
, and in the +65 
group the effects for DBP 
were unclear. Unclear (ES=0.67 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI −1.90 to 3.24) 
and a likely very largely beneficial (ES=2.15 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI 
0.46 to 3.83) ES were seen for SBP and DBP for the duration 
time of up to 12 
weeks of training. Most likely extremely large 
beneficial effects (ES=4.59 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI 2.46 to 6.72) and 
most likely very large beneficial effects (ES=3.63 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI 
2.14 to 5.12) were observed for training periods lasting more 
than 12 
weeks for SBP and DBP
, respectively. When the results 
were moderated using training frequency, a likely large beneficial 
and most likely extremely large beneficial ES were retrieved for 
moderators (≤2 
and >2 
sessions per week) for DPB. Likely very 
large beneficial effects were observed for SBP for both modera-
tors. A mean decrease of 5.3 
mm Hg and 4.0 
mm Hg for SBP and 
DBP was observed for football group and 3.5 and 0.7 
mm Hg for 
controls, respectively.
The effects on SBP of football when compared with running 
and Zumba groups were possibly moderately harmful, while 
the effect on DBP was unclear when compared with a Zumba 
group. The effect of recreational football on DBP when 
compared with continuous running was possibly largely benefi-
cial (ES=2.21 
mm Hg; 95% 
CI −0.81 to 5.23).

Meta-analysis of the effect of recreational football on RHR 
was determined as most likely extremely largely beneficial

with a non-active control group (table 5). A small unclear effect

was found in comparison with running (ES=0.57

for male and female gender moderators (ES=5.06 
beats/min; 
95% 
CI 2.48 to 7.64 and ES=2.95 
beats/min; 95% 
CI 0.76 to

years old was 
beneficial (ES=3.19 
beats/min; 95% 
CI 0.95 to 5.43, very likely 
very largely beneficial). When compared with the 45–65 and 
65+ age 
groups, the observed effects were most likely extremely

beats/min; 95% 
CI 2.14 to 9.18 and 
ES=6.00 
beats/min; 95%

results were compared by the training intervention duration 
moderators, the results were unclear and beneficial for up to 
12 
weeks (ES=1.99 
beats/min; 95% 
CI −2.09 to 6.08) and 
longer than 12 
weeks (ES=4.70 
beats/min; 95% 
CI 2.76 to 6.65, 
most likely extremely largely beneficial). Most likely extremely 
large beneficial effects were observed when training frequency 
was ≤2, 
while very likely very large beneficial effects were 
reported in the case of two or more sessions per week. Most 
likely very large beneficial (ES=3.83 
beats/min; 95% 
CI 2.16 to 
5.51) effect of recreational football intervention was computed 
for the overall sample.
study outcomes for body composition
Trivial and small effects were observed for BMI compared 
with all other investigated training regimens (table 6). Similar 
results were observed for body mass where the meta-analysed 
effects were trivial to small regardless of the type of control 
moderators, with unlikely small beneficial and very unlikely 
small harmful effects for the no-exercise and running groups 
(table 6). ES values for LBM were trivial and small regardless 
of moderator variables (table 7). In addition, the meta-anal-
ysed effect of recreational football compared with Zumba and 
for participants 46–65 
years old was unclear. With respect to 
the overall gender sample, the effect of football training was 
rated as very likely moderately beneficial (ES=1.10 
kg/m2; 
95% 
CI 0.54 to 1.66). Observed recreational football effect 
values with respect to fat mass were most likely largely beneficial 
(ES=1.72 
kg; 95% 
CI 0.86 to2.58) when compared with no-ex-
ercise controls (table 7). The effects were possibly small harmful 
when compared with running (ES=−0.41 
kg; 95% 
CI −1.24 to 
0.42) and unclear when compared with Zumba (ES=0.35 
kg; 
95% 
CI −1.54 to2.24). With respect to gender, ES was very 
likely largely beneficial and possibly moderately beneficial for 
male and female moderators. Beneficial effects were observed 
in the groups of 18–45 
years old and 45–65 
years old (possibly 
moderately beneficial and most likely large beneficial). When 
subgroup analysis was performed, very likely large beneficial 
and likely moderately beneficial effects were observed for inter-
vention duration of up to 12 
weeks and over 12 
weeks, while 
unlikely small harmful and most likely large beneficial ES was 
seen for up to two sessions per week and over two sessions per 
week.
study outcomes for muscular fitness
Overall change induced by recreational football training on 
countermovement jump (CMJ) was classified as moderately 
likely beneficial (ES=1.08 cm; 95% CI 0.15 to 2.00). The 
meta-analysed effect on CMJ of recreational football compared 
with no-exercise controls was most likely very largely beneficial 
(ES=2.27 cm; 95% CI 1.29 to 3.25; table 5). The effect was 
unclear when compared with running (ES=0.28 cm; 95% CI

with strength training (ES=−1.06 cm; 95% CI −3.40 to 
1.28). In cases where the results were analysed separately for 
men and women, ES values were very likely largely benefi-
cial and unclear. When compared between age groups, for 
18–45 years old ES was unclear, for the group of 46–65 years 
old it was unlikely trivially harmful (ES=−0.01 cm; 95% CI

likely largely beneficial (ES=1.63 cm; 95% CI 0.48 to 2.78). 
For training intervention duration, the effects were classified 
as unclear (ES=0.09 cm; 95% CI −1.86 to 2.03) for the up to

Review
study outcomes for metabolic responses
Effects of recreational football on metabolic responses were 
compared with no-exercise controls, but not compared by 
type of training intervention, sex, age, training frequency and 
duration moderators (figure 2). Overall effect was classified 
as possibly small beneficial (ES=0.21 
mmol/L; 95% 
CI 0.06 to 
0.36) for plasma LDL cholesterol (figure 2). Most likely trivial 
(ES=0.05 
mmol/L; 95% 
CI −0.02 to 0.13) were observed for 
plasma HDL cholesterol. Likely trivial effects were observed for 
total plasma cholesterol (ES=0.13 
mmol/L; 95% 
CI −0.03 to 
0.29), plasma triglycerides (ES=0.15 
mmol/L; 95% 
CI 0.03 to 
0.26) and blood glucose (ES=0.00 
mmol/L; 95% 
CI −0.22 to 
0.22), while possibly trivial effects were seen for glucose toler-
ance (ES=−0.13 mmol/L; 95% 
CI −0.49 to 0.22) (figure 2).
Publication bias
The Egger’s test was performed to provide statistical evidence of 
funnel plot asymmetry. The results indicated publication bias for 
blood pressure and CMJ analysis (P<0.10). Publication bias was 
not observed for the remaining variables (P>0.10).
GRADE recommendations for strength of evidence
Observed results strongly recommend to use recreational foot-
ball to reduce BMI, body mass and LBM because overall quality 
of evidence is high without any publication bias or inconsistency 
among included studies (table 8). Moderate quality of evidence 
was determined for SBP and DBP without inconsistency. Results 
recommended recreational football because of its desirable 
effects on SBP and DBP
. Additionally, certainty of metabolic 
parameters (total plasma cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, fasting 
blood glucose and glucose tolerance) was high without risk of 
bias and inconsistency. In contrast, certainty of fat mass variable 
is low with serious inconsistency as well as strongly suspected 
publication bias.
DIsCussIOn
The principal findings from the 31 papers that met the inclu-
sion criteria were that recreational football has multiple posi-
tive effects on health-related physical fitness in comparison with 
no-exercise controls, including beneficial effects on systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, RHR, fat mass, plasma LDL cholesterol 
and CMJ performance.
Previous meta-analyses have revealed that recreational foot-
ball interventions lasting 3–4 months have a positive impact on 
maximal oxygen uptake compared with no-exercise controls 
in both men and women, with calculated average effects of 
4.11 
mL/kg/min15 and 3.51 
mL/kg/min,6 respectively. One of 
the main findings of the present study is that, when compared 
with no-exercise controls, recreational football interventions 
demonstrate additional positive effects on cardiovascular fitness 
and health profile, including improvements in blood pressure. 
Indeed, the impact of 3–4 months of recreational football organ-
ised as 45–60 
min two to three times per week was most likely 
beneficial for SBP and most likely beneficial for DBP compared 
with no-exercise controls. As expected, a greater blood pressure 
reduction was observed with 3–4 months of recreational football 
interventions for participants with hypertension than for indi-
viduals with normotension.45 The observed reduction in SBP and 
DBP was 11 and 7 
mm Hg in subjects with mild hypertension 
and 10 and 7 
mm Hg in individuals with prehypertension. These 
improvements are comparable with the acute effect of taking 
one standard dose of a blood pressure-lowering drug,46 and have 
important clinical importance as a blood pressure reduction of 
such a magnitude corresponds to a lowered risk of stroke by 
20%–30% in individuals with hypertension.46
The positive effects were observed in both men and women, 
and for age groups of 18–45 
years old and 45–60 
years old. 
Specifically, the meta-analysis showed the effect of recreational 
football on SBP to be possibly very large and very likely extremely 
largely beneficial in men and women, and indicated that the 
effect on DBP was greater for men than for women. When 
recreational football effects were related to age, likely very large 
beneficial effects were observed for DBP in the 18–45 age group 
and most likely very largely beneficial for the 45–65 age group, 
whereas only the 45–65 age group had positive effects on SBP
. It 
was interesting to note that a harmful effect was found for SBP 
and a large beneficial effect for DBP compared with continuous 
running. Aerobic training that lasts between 16 and 52 weeks can 
lower resting blood pressure (both SBP and DBP) by 1%–2%.35 47 
Football training proved to be superior in lowering DBP directly

induced through improved muscle capillarisation, decreased 
arterial stiffness and increased cardiac relaxation time.35 Recre-
ational football effectively lowered SBP
, but in comparison with 
Zumba exercise it had moderately negative effects. Physiological 
effects including cardiovascular response to Zumba activity are 
not fully elucidated and further research is needed.26 27
With regard to the impact of recreational football training 
on RHR, our findings provide further support for the previous 
scientific studies that found that heart rate decreases with 
3–4 
months of recreational football performed for 45–60 
min 
two to three times per week (6 beats per minute).15 Hence, the 
present meta-analysis showed the effect of recreational football

Review
on RHR to be most likely extremely largely beneficial when 
compared with a non-active group, with positive very large 
effects in men as well as women. Positive effects were detected 
across all adult age ranges, including those aged 18–45 
years 
old, 45–65 
years old and over 65 years. No clear evidence was 
obtained when comparing the effects of recreational football on 
RHR with those of other sporting activities.
The present meta-analysis rates the effect of recreational foot-
ball with respect to fat mass to be most likely largely beneficial 
compared with inactive controls, which is in accordance with the 
recent analysis by Oja et al.15 Thus, football training interven-
tions lasting 12–16 weeks (2×60 
min sessions/week) are likely 
to cause a decrease in total fat mass of 1–3 
kg, which is clinically 
significant for overweight and obese adults.15 The present as 
well as other meta-analyses15 provide evidence that recreational 
football training is very likely beneficial for decreasing fat mass 
in both genders. Moreover, the 18–45 and 45–65 age groups 
were observed to respond to this type of physical training. The 
effects of football training are not as clear when compared with 
other exercise training protocols. For example, there are no clear 
effects when compared with Zumba dancing. Considering the 
limited number of studies reporting the effects of other sport 
disciplines, conclusions about the health benefits cannot yet be 
conclusively drawn. When evaluating the impact of recreational 
football on LBM, the effects were rated as trivial to small, when 
performed 2×60 
min per week for 12–16 weeks, while the effect 
of football versus Zumba was unclear. In relation to gender, 
women display a greater effect than their male counterparts. In 
addition, participants in the 18–45 age group tend to respond 
better than older age groups (45–65 and 65+).
The effect of recreational football training on CMJ when 
compared with inactive controls was most likely very largely 
beneficial. The outcome of football training was unclear when 
compared with running and potentially lower when compared 
with strength training. Considering the limited existing data, 
no clear gender effect in women was detected with respect to 
the effects of recreational football training, while in men the 
effect was very likely largely beneficial. In individuals older than 
65 
years, somewhat greater ES were observed compared with the 
18–45 age group. Finally, recreational football training interven-
tions lasting longer than 12 
weeks induced better responses in 
CMJ performance than interventions lasting less than 12 
weeks.
Metabolic responses and their relationship to recreational 
football were displayed through changes in blood lipids, glucose 
concentration and glucose tolerance. It is strongly substanti-
ated that exercise training lowers these metabolic risk factors 
for pathological conditions such as cardiac dysfunctions, 
sudden mortality and morbidity, arteriosclerosis and type II 
diabetes.3 24 35 In a narrative review by Bangsbo et al,3 it was 
reported that changes provoked by recreational football were 
mainly non-significant, including reduced plasma LDL choles-
terol level (4%–15%)5 29 33 and total plasma cholesterol (0.6%–
8%),7 25 33 along with elevated HDL level (0%–9%).7 31 The 
present meta-analysis indicates similar outcomes with possibly 
small beneficial decrease in plasma LDL along with most likely 
and likely trivial in plasma HDL upregulation and triglycerides 
and total cholesterol decrement. The plasma LDL decrease was 
related mainly to increased weekly training frequency for the 
first 12 
weeks, which could not be maintained for an additional 
52 
weeks when training frequency was reduced.24 35 The changes 
were generally caused by the responsive nature of LDL and HDL 
to aerobically induced energy expenditure.10 24 32 Additionally, 
the metabolic responses for fasting blood glucose and glucose 
tolerance (after 2 
hours) were trivial. Although the precise effects 
of recreational football compared with other types of exercise 
were not meta-analysed due to insufficient data, it is evident 
that recreational football displays a greater effect on blood lipids 
compared with other aerobic exercise regimens,5 24 29 and that 
the magnitude of change is associated with sex, baseline obesity 
level and maximal oxidative capacity.32 Further scientific work 
should examine effectiveness of recreational football of different 
formats and in comparison with strength training on various 
health-related physical fitness components.
Despite the multitude benefits elucidated in the present 
systematic review and meta-analysis, there are some limitations. 
For example, it is plausible to suggest that studies reporting 
statistically significant or positive results are more likely to be 
published in scientific journals compared with results showing no 
treatment effects. In line with this statement, one of the limita-
tions in this meta-analysis is the phenomenon of negative results 
publication bias. Additionally, the small number of included 
studies measuring metabolic parameters may be a limitation, 
since ES could not be calculated for moderator variables. Finally, 
the lack of duplicate data extraction could be considered as a 
limitation of this meta-analysis.
COnClusIOn
In conclusion, the present meta-analysis demonstrated multiple 
broad-spectrum positive physical health effects of recreational 
football training in comparison with no-exercise controls, 
including beneficial effects on blood pressure, RHR, fat mass, 
LDL cholesterol and CMJ performance. In addition, it was 
evident that the majority of these effects occurred independently 
of age and gender, and most of the effects, except improvements 
in CMJ, occurred after only 12 
weeks of training. Recreational 
football proved to be similarly effective and beneficial when 
compared with other exercise regimens on health-related phys-
ical fitness components. Thus, recreational football is a worth-
while alternative to Zumba dancing and continuous running 
providing similar decreases in body weight and fat mass.
What is already known?
 
► Recreational football is an intense versatile activity with 
marked positive effects on aerobic fitness.
 
► This exercise modality is suitable for both genders regardless 
of age, fitness level and skills.
 
► Recreational football is a highly motivating activity compared 
with conventional exercise programmes.
What are the findings?
 
► Recreational football displays positive effects on health-
related physical fitness in comparison with no-exercise 
controls, including beneficial effects on cardiovascular, 
metabolic and musculoskeletal health. 
 
► Recreational football induces a broad-spectrum positive 
impact on health-related physical fitness in healthy people 
regardless of gender and fitness level.
 
► Recreational football can be applied as an effective broad-
spectrum non-pharmacological treatment of lifestyle diseases, 
such as hypertension and metabolic syndrome.
