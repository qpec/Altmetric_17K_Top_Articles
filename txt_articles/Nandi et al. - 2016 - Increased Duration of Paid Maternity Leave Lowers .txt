Abstract
Background
Maternity leave reduces neonatal and infant mortality rates in high-income countries. How-
ever, the impact of maternity leave on infant health has not been rigorously evaluated in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this study, we utilized a difference-in-differ-
ences approach to evaluate whether paid maternity leave policies affect infant mortality in
LMICs.
Methods and Findings
We used birth history data collected via the Demographic and Health Surveys to assemble
a panel of approximately 300,000 live births in 20 countries from 2000 to 2008; these obser-
vational data were merged with longitudinal information on the duration of paid maternity
leave provided by each country. We estimated the effect of an increase in maternity leave in
the prior year on the probability of infant (<1 y), neonatal (<28 d), and post-neonatal
(between 28 d and 1 y after birth) mortality. Fixed effects for country and year were included
to control for, respectively, unobserved time-invariant confounders that varied across coun-
tries and temporal trends in mortality that were shared across countries. Average rates of
infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality over the study period were 55.2, 30.7, and
23.0 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Each additional month of paid maternity was associ-
ated with 7.9 fewer infant deaths per 1,000 live births (95% CI 3.7, 12.0), reflecting a 13%
relative reduction. Reductions in infant mortality associated with increases in the duration of
paid maternity leave were concentrated in the post-neonatal period. Estimates were robust
to adjustment for individual, household, and country-level characteristics, although there
may be residual confounding by unmeasured time-varying confounders, such as coincident
policy changes.

 Conclusions
More generous paid maternity leave policies represent a potential instrument for facilitating
early-life interventions and reducing infant mortality in LMICs and warrant further discussion
in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda. From a policy planning perspective, fur-
ther work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that explain the benefits of paid maternity
leave for infant mortality.
Introduction
Paid leave for new parents, often specifically designated for new mothers, is a standard social
benefit in most of the world. Over 180 countries have enacted legislation granting paid leave
from employment in connection with the birth of a child, either in the form of maternity leave
or gender-neutral parental leave [1].
Paid maternity and parental leave policies are consistently associated with improvements in
child health in high-income countries [1–5]. For example, Ruhm found that increases in weeks
of paid leave were associated with lower infant mortality in 16 European countries, although
effects on perinatal and neonatal mortality were more modest [3]. Similarly, Tanaka showed
that increases in paid parental leave were associated with decreases in perinatal, neonatal, post-
neonatal, infant, and child mortality in a sample of 18 Organisation for Economic Co-opera-
tion and Development countries [4]. Recent work also showed that unpaid maternal leave pro-
vided through the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 in the United States was associated
with decreases in neonatal, post-neonatal, and infant mortality, but only among women who
were married and had graduated from college, suggesting that women of lower socioeconomic
position may have been unable to take unpaid leave [5].
Paid maternity leave may affect neonatal and infant mortality through several mechanisms.
First, paid maternity leave may increase access to pre- and postnatal health services. Some
maternity leave policies allow for a short period of leave to be taken immediately prior to birth,
which might increase receipt of third-trimester prenatal care. In the postnatal period, mothers
able to take leave from employment may have more time to care for an ill child and seek medi-
cal care when necessary. Second, policies that provide income and ensure job protection during
maternity leave may benefit women economically, reduce stress in the prenatal period, and
improve maternal health after birth [6–8]; these factors might reduce adverse birth outcomes,
including preterm birth and low birth weight [9–11]. Third, paid maternity leave might facili-
tate preventive care; for example, women able to take leave from employment are more likely
to initiate breastfeeding and to continue breastfeeding for longer durations [12–15]. Paid
maternity leave may also improve adherence to childhood vaccination schedules [16–18].
These mechanisms may interact synergistically; for example, increased income may be associ-
ated with more access to resources to support healthy behaviors and child-rearing practices
[19,20].
Extant evaluations of paid maternity leave policies have been conducted almost exclusively
in high-income countries. Whether these results can be generalized to lower-income contexts
is unclear, given differences in the nature of non-parental child-care options as well as in wom-
en’s participation in the formal economy. In this study, we provide the first evaluation, to our
knowledge, of whether paid maternity leave policies affect infant (<1 y), neonatal (<28 d), and
post-neonatal (between 28 d and 1 y after birth) mortality in low- and middle-income coun-
tries (LMICs). We constructed a database of maternity leave policies for LMICs over time,

 merged this information to a sample of live births occurring between 2000 and 2008 in 20
LMICs surveyed as part of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), and utilized a differ-
ence-in-differences approach to estimate the influence of paid maternity leave on mortality
during the first year of life.
Methods
Sample
Information on birth outcomes was derived from the DHS. The authors had full access to the
DHS data from which the analytic sample is derived. The DHS collect comparable information
on demographic, socioeconomic, nutritional, behavioral, fertility, and health characteristics
from a nationally representative sample of households in LMICs using a two-stage cluster sam-
pling design. Individuals are selected for interviews from household rosters; information is col-
lected on women of reproductive age (15–49 y), men (usually aged 15–54 or 15–59 y), and
children under the age of 5 y. Trained interviewers and standardized tools and measurement
techniques are used to ensure comparability of surveys across countries and survey waves. Fur-
ther details regarding sampling strategies and study procedures are available elsewhere [21,22].
Our sample comprised all live births occurring to DHS respondents from 20 LMICs
between 2000 and 2008. These 20 countries were selected because they administered at least
two DHS surveys between 2001 and 2011, which permitted analyses of policy changes occur-
ring within countries over time. Briefly, mothers surveyed in the DHS were asked to provide
information concerning all children born alive in the previous 5 y. These data were used to
construct a panel of live births, each with information on vital status, over a consistent set of
years and countries. We created two separate samples, one for our analyses of infant and post-
neonatal mortality and the other for analyses of neonatal mortality. We restricted these sam-
ples to the 282,836 and 304,294 live births that occurred at least 1 y and at least 28 d prior to
the DHS interview date, respectively, in order to ascertain whether each child survived the
infant (1 y) and neonatal (28 d) periods following birth. After further excluding observations
with missing information on key covariates, our samples were composed of 282,751 live births
between 2000 and 2007 for analyses of infant and post-neonatal mortality and 304,201 live
births between 2001 and 2008 for analyses of neonatal mortality. Table 1 reports survey years
and sample sizes for the sampled countries. The Institutional Review Board of McGill Univer-
sity reviewed and approved this study.
Measures
The exposure of interest in our study was the legislated length of paid maternity leave for each
country and year. Data on current maternity leave policies for each sampled country were pro-
vided by the University of California Los Angeles World Legal Rights Data Centre, and data on
past maternity leave policies back to 1995 were collected by McGill University’s Maternal and
Child Health Equity (MACHEquity) research program. We defined the duration of paid
maternity leave as the legislated length of paid leave available to mothers only. We did not dis-
tinguish leave that could be taken in the prenatal period from leave that could be taken after
birth; however, few maternity leave policies in LMICs mandate specifically prenatal versus
postnatal leave. Further details regarding the collection and coding of global maternity leave
policies are available elsewhere [1].
The outcome variables—infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality—were measured
using the 5-y birth histories provided by women interviewed in the DHS. We created binary
indicators for infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality to measure whether each child died
within 1 y, within the first 28 d of life, or between 28 d and 1 y after birth, respectively.

 We collected information on potential confounders and other characteristics based on a
review of the literature on determinants of neonatal and infant mortality in LMICs [23–31].
Individual and household-level socio-demographic characteristics included the child’s gender,
mother’s educational attainment in completed years, urban/rural residence, and household
socioeconomic status (SES). Household SES, categorized into five equal groups using quintiles,
was determined from the continuous wealth index provided by the DHS, which is based on
ownership of specific assets (e.g., bicycle, radio, and television), environmental conditions, and
housing characteristics (e.g., type of water source, sanitation facilities, materials used for hous-
ing construction), and was constructed using the method proposed by Filmer and Pritchett
[32,33]. Birth characteristics included the interval between births (defined as short if it was less
than 24 mo), maternal age at the time of each birth (categorized as <20, 20–39, or 40 y and
older), and whether there was a skilled birth attendant present at the time of delivery. Aside

 from the length of paid leave, another defining feature of paid maternity leave policies is the
percentage at which wages are replaced. Because changes in the wage replacement rate some-
times coincided (i.e., in Lesotho) with changes in the legislated length of leave, we controlled
for the wage replacement rate as a potential confounder. Additional time-varying country-level
covariates included levels of economic development (measured by gross domestic product
[GDP] per capita based on purchasing power parity [PPP], in constant 2005 international dol-
lars), female labor force participation (the proportion of women age 15 y and older in the labor
force), per capita total health expenditure (PPP, in constant 2005 international dollars), and
per capita government health expenditure (PPP, in constant 2005 international dollars), which
were available from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators and Global Develop-
ment Finance databases [34].
Statistical Analysis
We linked data on paid maternity leave policies to outcomes and covariates from the DHS by
country and birth year and examined the effects of an increase in the duration of paid maternity
leave on the risk of mortality during the first year of life. Specifically, we estimated for birth i the
effect of an additional month of paid leave (lagged by 1 y to respect the temporal ordering
between the policy and outcome) on the probabilities of infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mor-
tality using a linear probability model of the general form Yijt = αj + βMjt−1 + λt + �ijt, where β
measures the effect of a 1-mo increase in maternity leave in the prior year, Mjt−1 (where j indexes
the country and t the birth year), on infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal death, Yijt. We included
fixed effects for country (αj) and year (λt) to control for unobserved time-invariant confounders
that vary across countries and any temporal trends in mortality that are shared across countries,
respectively. The effects of paid maternity leave policies were therefore identified by changes in
outcomes occurring within countries that modified their maternity leave policies during the
study period (treated countries) relative to corresponding changes in outcomes in countries that
did not modify their policies during the study period (control countries).
In the first model, we estimated the effect of an additional month of paid maternity leave on
infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality after including country and year fixed effects
(Model 1). In the second model, we additionally controlled for measured individual, house-
hold, and country-level characteristics, including the lagged wage replacement rate, natural log
per capita GDP, and female labor force participation (Model 2). In the third model, we
included controls for natural log per capita total and government health expenditures (Model
3); these data were unavailable for all years for Zimbabwe, and observations from Zimbabwe
were therefore dropped from Model 3 analyses. In order to examine potential nonlinearity in
the effect of paid maternity leave, we introduced a quadratic duration-of-paid-leave variable
into our fully adjusted model (Model 3). We also estimated the fully adjusted model on the risk
ratio (RR) scale. All analyses incorporated respondent-level sampling weights to account for
individual survey sample designs. Per DHS guidelines, we used information on the number of
women aged 15–49 y in each survey-year, provided by the Population Division of the United
Nations [35], and applied the de-normalization of standard weights approach described in the
DHS Sampling and Household Listing Manual [36], in order to calculate an appropriate weight
for each observation in the analyses. All models incorporated robust standard errors to account
for clustering at the country level [37].
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our main findings. First, because
there is no standard metric for maternity leave policies, we measured the effects of paid leave in
Paid Maternity Leave and Infant Mortality in LMICs

 full-time equivalent (FTE) units, obtained by multiplying the legislated length of leave by the
wage replacement rate, in addition to the duration of any paid leave. Further details regarding
the calculation of FTE units of paid leave are available elsewhere [1,16]. Second, we examined
whether results were sensitive to the inclusion of sampling weights. Third, we added to our pri-
mary exposure, paid maternity leave in year t − 1, parameters representing paid maternity
leave in preceding years (t − 3, t − 2), the birth year (t), and subsequent years (t + 1, t + 2, t
+ 3). These analyses assessed if there were persistent effects of the policy changes, as well as
whether observed effects were responses to policy changes that occurred in the period during
or before the measurement of our outcomes, as we would expect if the effects of paid maternity
leave policies were causal. Fourth, as described in S1 Text, we assessed whether our findings
were sensitive to the particular selection of control countries. In these analyses, we examined
trends in infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality occurring in the decade before our
treated countries changed their legislated length of paid maternity leave and then restricted the
sample of controls to those countries with parallel pre-intervention trends.
Results
Table 1 shows the rates of infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality for the 20 DHS countries;
average rates of infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality over the study period were 55.2, 30.7,
and 23.0 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Table 2 shows trends in paid maternity leave benefits
and country-level characteristics for the five treated and 15 control countries; baseline values for
key covariates are provided for each country in S1 Table and trends in the duration of paid leave
for individual treated countries are shown in S1 Fig. For treated countries, the average length of
paid leave increased from 7.6 (standard deviation [SD] = 5.4) wk in 2000 to 12.2 (SD = 3.8) wk in
2008. The average length of paid leave in control countries was 12.2 (SD = 3.0) wk.
Tables 3, 4 and 5 show the effects of an additional month of paid maternity leave on the proba-
bility of infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal death, respectively. In the fully adjusted model
(Model 3), an additional month of paid maternity leave was associated with 7.9 (95% CI 3.7, 12.0)
fewer infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Each additional month of paid leave was associated with
2.9 (95% CI –0.2, 6.0) fewer neonatal and 4.4 (95% CI 0.9, 8.0) fewer post-neonatal deaths per
1,000 live births. On the RR scale, each additional month of paid leave was associated with a 13%
(RR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.81, 0.93), 9% (RR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.83, 1.00), and 18% (RR = 0.82, 95% CI
0.64, 1.05) reduction in infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality, respectively (S2 Table).
There was some evidence for a nonlinear effect of an additional month of paid maternity leave on
the probabilities of infant and post-neonatal mortality, but not neonatal mortality (S3 Table). In
particular, an additional month of paid leave was associated with a larger absolute reduction in
infant and post-neonatal mortality when shorter durations of paid leave were available (S2 Fig).
There were pronounced socioeconomic gradients in infant and post-neonatal, but not neo-
natal, mortality; there were, on average, 13.6 (95% CI 7.1, 20.0) fewer infant deaths per 1,000
live births in households in the highest quintile of household SES compared to the lowest quin-
tile. Birth characteristics, including short birth interval (<24 mo) and lower maternal age (<20
y), were consistently associated with neonatal and infant mortality. For example, a short birth
interval was associated with an additional 32.9 (95% CI 22.7, 43.1) infant, 14.2 (95% CI 10.4,
18.0) neonatal, and 15.7 (95% CI 10.8, 20.7) post-neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births. Coun-
try-level characteristics were not associated with mortality.

of leave was associated with a smaller decrease in infant mortality of 3.6 (95% CI −2.4, 9.6)

els that were unweighted (Model B). Additionally, estimates of the effects of paid leave modeled
separately in years before and after the policy change were relatively imprecise (Model C). The
effect of paid maternity leave on post-neonatal mortality was similar in unweighted and
weighted models (Model B); however, the effects of lagged and lead effects were unstable and
difficult to interpret (Model C).

 Discussion
We merged longitudinal information on the legislated duration of paid maternity leave in 20
LMICs with a panel of approximately 300,000 live births recorded in DHS surveys in those
countries between 2000 and 2008 and used this dataset to conduct the first evaluation, to our
knowledge, of the impact of paid maternity leave on infant mortality in LMICs. Difference-in-
differences analyses suggested that each additional month of paid maternal leave was associ-
ated with approximately eight fewer infant deaths per 1,000 live births. These findings were rel-
atively robust to alternative model specifications.
Policies guaranteeing new mothers paid leave from work provide new mothers with the
opportunity to rest and recover after childbirth, increase their job protection and labor force
attachment [38], and may benefit their mental and physical health [7,8,39]. Moreover, a grow-
ing literature suggests that paid maternity leave policies have a beneficial effect on maternal
health behaviors, including breastfeeding [12–15], and infant health in higher-income coun-
tries [3–5]. Given the lack of evidence, it has been unclear if these findings can be generalized
to poorer countries, where rates of female labor force participation in the formal economy are
generally lower. Our results indicate that more generous paid maternity leave policies may
have an even greater potential to reduce infant mortality in LMICs than in higher-income
countries [3,4], both in absolute and relative terms, although prior work in high-income coun-
tries considered parental leave rather than maternity leave per se. Furthermore, our findings
suggest that the benefits of additional paid maternity leave in terms of reducing infant mortal-
ity were larger when shorter durations of paid leave were available. Heterogeneity in the impact
of paid maternity leave across countries warrants further investigation. Although a smaller pro-
portion of women may be eligible for leave in LMICs than in high-income countries, and leave
policy implementation may be poorer, the actual benefit to child health conditional on being
eligible may be substantial, given higher infant mortality rates in poorer contexts. Furthermore,
a greater proportion of women in LMICs may be benefiting from leave benefits than we might
anticipate. Labor reforms targeting the formal economy may have spillover effects that influ-
ence workers in the informal economy. Moreover, many international labor standards and
national laws are constructed to encompass all types of workers.
Similar to observations from higher-income countries [3,4], extending the duration of paid
leave available to new mothers resulted in larger reductions in mortality in the post-neonatal
than in the neonatal period. An increase in the duration of paid leave available to mothers
might influence postnatal factors, including the duration of breastfeeding and vaccination
uptake, which are consistently associated with better infant health [40–42]. Recent work, for
example, showed that increases in paid maternity leave were associated with increased uptake
of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus immunizations [43]. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that
neonatal mortality, by contrast, is determined to a greater extent by antenatal factors that are
less likely to be influenced by increases in maternity leave, unless that leave is taken before
birth; these factors include maternal and reproductive factors, such as maternal age and birth
spacing, as well as health services characteristics, including the use of antenatal care and the
place of delivery [44–50]. Further research into the effects of maternity leave policies on utiliza-
tion of health services and behavioral risk factors for neonatal and infant mortality is needed.
Our findings suggest there is potential for improving infant health by increasing the dura-
tion of paid maternity leave in LMICs. Recently, the Countdown to 2015 report suggested that
only one-third of the 75 “Countdown countries,” those accounting for more than 95% of global
maternal and infant deaths, achieved the Millennium Development Goal 4 of reducing child
(<5 y) mortality by two-thirds by 2015 [51]. As others have argued [52], in order to end pre-
ventable deaths among children, countries will need to address neonatal and infant deaths

 more effectively. Data from the MACHEquity research program showed that one-quarter of
the Countdown countries provided less than 12 wk of paid maternity leave in 2012
(median = 12.9 wk). Our findings suggest that social interventions, in addition to health policy
interventions [53], warrant further discussion in the post-2015 development agenda. More
generous paid maternity leave policies represent a potential instrument for facilitating early-
life interventions and reducing infant mortality in LMICs.
There were limitations to our study. First, as in any non-experimental study, there is the
potential for unmeasured confounding. However, we controlled for potential confounding by
individual, household, and country-level characteristics. We also included fixed effects for
country and year to account for unobserved time-invariant confounders that vary across coun-
tries and any temporal trends in mortality that are shared across countries, respectively. There-
fore, any unmeasured confounders that would remain to bias our estimates would have to
coincide with policy changes occurring within treated countries and also influence mortality,
which markedly reduces the list of potential unobserved confounders. However, the adoption
of several policies, including paid leave policies, simultaneously would conflate effects and
potentially bias our results. Second, the determination of our outcomes, neonatal and infant
mortality, depends on maternal recall, and mothers may underreport the births and deaths of
children who are not alive at the time of the interview. Such underreporting would bias our
estimates only if it were different between our treatment and control countries. Third, our mea-
sure of paid maternity leave is calculated based on legislated maternity leave and does not
account for other leave (i.e., parental leave) that might also be available to mothers. Fourth, in
order to model the longitudinal effect of maternity leave policies on neonatal and infant mor-
tality, we limited our analyses to 20 selected LMICs with at least two DHS surveys between
2001 and 2011; the inclusion of sampling weights allows us to generalize our results to these 20
countries, but not to all LMICs.
Caveats considered, our analyses suggest that an additional month of paid maternity leave is
associated with as much as a 13% reduction in infant mortality in LMICs. From a policy plan-
ning perspective, further work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that explain the beneficial
effects of paid maternity leave on infant mortality and to evaluate the optimal balance of leave
from employment prior to and following delivery, as well as varying levels of compensation.
Further work is also needed to document the effects of paid maternity leave on women’s labor
force participation, health, and well-being in LMICs.

 Editors' Summary
Background
In 1990, 12 million children—most of them living in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs)—died before their fifth birthday. Out of every 1,000 children born alive, 90 died
before they were five years old. In 2000, world leaders set a target of reducing under-five
mortality (deaths) to one-third of its 1990 level by 2015 as Millennium Development Goal
4 (MDG4); this goal, together with seven others, was designed to eradicate extreme pov-
erty globally. Over the years, steady progress was made towards MDG4. Better delivery
facilities and programs that encouraged breastfeeding, immunization, and other practices
that improved the health of young children reduced the global under-five mortality rate.
But, by 2015, the rate had only fallen to 43 deaths per 1,000 live births, and 5.9 million chil-
dren under five died that year from preventable causes such as preterm birth complica-
tions, delivery complications, and infections. Nearly half of these deaths occurred among
neonates (babies less than 28 days old); three-quarters of them occurred among infants
(children less than 1 year old).
Why Was This Study Done?
In high-income countries, paid leave from employment for mothers is associated with
reduced neonatal and infant mortality. Many LMICs now have legislation granting paid
maternity leave or gender-neutral parental leave. But does paid maternity leave have the
same impact on infant health in LMICs as it does in high-income countries? In this quasi-
experimental study, the researchers use the difference-in-differences statistical approach
to investigate whether paid maternity leave policies affect infant mortality in LMICs. A
quasi-experimental study uses observational data to compare outcomes in a group of peo-
ple receiving an intervention (the treatment group) with outcomes in a group of people
not receiving the intervention (control group); unlike a randomized controlled trial, these
groups are not chosen at random. The difference-in-differences approach compares the
average change over time in an outcome variable (here, infant mortality) in a treatment
group (here, babies born in countries with a change—specifically, an increase—in paid
maternity leave duration) with the average change over time in the outcome variable in a
control group (here, babies born in countries without a change in paid maternity leave
duration).
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
The researchers assembled a panel of about 300,000 live births in 20 LMICs between 2000
and 2008 using birth history data collected by the Demographic and Health Surveys
(which collect information on the demographic, health, and other characteristics of a
nationally representative sample of households). The researchers merged these observa-
tional data with information on the duration of paid maternity leave provided by each
country and used the difference-in-differences approach to estimate the effect of an
increase in paid maternity leave duration on the probability of infant (<1 year old), neona-
tal (<28 days old), and post-neonatal (between 28 days and 1 year old) mortality. Average
rates of infant, neonatal, and post-neonatal mortality over the study period were 55.2,
30.7, and 23.0 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Each additional month of paid maternity
leave was associated with 7.9 fewer infant deaths per 1,000 live births, a relative reduction

 in infant mortality of 13%. Notably, the reduction in infant mortality with increased dura-
tion of paid maternity leave was concentrated in the post-neonatal period.
What Do These Findings Mean?
These findings suggest that policies that increase the duration of paid maternity leave
could help to reduce infant mortality in the 20 LMICs included in this study. These find-
ings may not be generalizable to all LMICs. Moreover, their accuracy may be limited by
confounding. That is, unmeasured characteristics—rather than changes in paid maternity
leave duration—could be responsible for the observed changes in infant mortality.
Although the researchers adjusted for many possible confounders in their analysis, there
may be some residual confounding from unmeasured time-varying confounders such as
other policy changes made during the study period. Further work is now needed to deter-
mine the mechanisms that underlie the observed association between increased duration
of paid maternity leave and reduction in infant mortality in LMICs. Paid maternity leave
might, for example, improve infant health by giving new mothers time to breastfeed, care
for ill babies, or ensure that their babies receive their childhood vaccinations. Finally,
before LMICs introduce new policies on paid maternity leave, the optimal balance of paid
leave from employment before and after delivery needs to be evaluated.
