Each year in the United States, cigarette smoking causes an 
estimated 480,000 deaths, including approximately 41,000 
deaths from secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmok-
ing adults (1). Smoke-free policies protect nonsmokers from 
secondhand smoke exposure, reduce the social acceptability of 
smoking, help in preventing youth and young adult smoking 
initiation, and increase smokers’ efforts to quit smoking (1,2). 
Given that 99% of adult cigarette smokers first start smoking 
before age 26 years and many smokers transition to regular, 
daily use during young adulthood (2),* colleges and universities 
represent an important venue for protecting students, faculty, 
staff members, and guests from secondhand smoke exposure 
through tobacco control policies (3). To assess smoke-free and 
tobacco-free policies in U.S. colleges and universities, CDC 
and the American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation (ANRF) 
determined the number of campuses nationwide that com-
pletely prohibit smoking (smoke-free) or both smoking and 
smokeless tobacco product use (tobacco-free) in all indoor and 
outdoor areas. As of November 2017, at least 2,082 U.S. college 
and university campuses had smoke-free policies. Among these 
campuses, 1,743 (83.7%) were tobacco-free; 1,658 (79.6%) 
specifically prohibited electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use; and 
854 (41.0%) specifically prohibited hookah smoking. Smoke-
free and tobacco-free policies on college and university cam-
puses can help reduce secondhand smoke exposure, tobacco 
use initiation, and the social acceptability of tobacco use (1–3).
Data on smoke-free and tobacco-free policies enacted as of 
November 2017 were obtained from ANRF’s College Campus 
Tobacco Policy Database,† the only national repository of 
tobacco restrictions on college campuses in the United States. 
The database is compiled using a daily news digest from 
Internet searches, as well as direct communication with state 
and local health departments, university officials, students, and 
alumni.§ The policies then are analyzed using standardized 
criteria and entered into the database. Campuses eligible for 
consideration are located in all 50 U.S. states, the District of 
Columbia, commonwealths, territories, and in tribal entities.
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/nap18997/pdf.
† https://no-smoke.org/colleges-universities-list-criteria/.
§ Information on school policies is also gathered by ANRF program personnel 
providing technical assistance in this area. Details are confirmed by reviewing 
a copy of the final policy, either on the institution’s website or via an institution 
contact with access to the policy documentation.
College and university campuses were considered smoke-free 
if they completely prohibited smoking in all indoor and out-
door areas, and tobacco-free if they prohibited both smoking 
and smokeless tobacco product use in all indoor and outdoor 
areas.¶ In addition, those that explicitly prohibited use of 
e-cigarettes and hookah smoking were also assessed.** For 
institutions comprising multiple physical learning sites with or 
without distinct policies, each site was evaluated as a separate 
campus. Campuses without smoke-free or tobacco-free poli-
cies were not included in the database, and data on the total 
number of U.S. college and university campuses as defined in 
the context of this report were unavailable. Therefore, it was 
not possible to summarize the number of smoke-free campuses 
as a percentage of total U.S. campuses. Findings were reported 
overall and by state and campus type (public; private; com-
munity college; historically black college or university; and 
tribal).†† Campus type categories were not mutually exclusive, 
and campuses could be categorized as multiple types.
As of November 2017, at least 2,082 U.S. college and 
university campuses were smoke-free (Table 1). Among these 
campuses, 1,743 (83.7%) were tobacco-free; 1,658 (79.6%) 
specifically prohibited e-cigarette use; and 854 (41.0%) specifi-
cally prohibited hookah smoking.
 ¶ For smoke-free campuses, the law or institutional policy prohibits smoking 
of combustible tobacco products on the entire campus property, both indoors 
and out, including remote parking lots, stadiums, theater performances, and 
residential housing (where applicable). For tobacco-free campuses, the law or 
institutional policy prohibits smoking of combustible tobacco products and 
the use of smokeless tobacco products on the entire campus property, both 
indoors and out, including remote parking lots, stadiums, theater 
performances, and residential housing (where applicable). The only possible 
exemptions for smoke-free and tobacco-free campuses include one’s personal 
vehicle, research in a controlled lab setting, or religious ceremonial purposes.
 
** Coverage of hookah smoking is not consistently addressed under smoke-free 
policies for college or university campuses. Therefore, subsequent analyses 
determined the proportion of smoke-free policies that contain language 
specifically prohibiting hookah (e.g. “hookah,” “shisha,” or “water pipe”) use 
anywhere on campus.
 
†† A public college or university was defined as a campus funded by government 
means. A private college or university was defined as a campus not funded by 
government means. A community college was defined as a campus with 
“community college” in the name or that described itself as one in the 
documentation encountered during analysis, confirmed via a reliable source 
familiar with the entity or via Internet research. A historically black college 
or university was defined as a campus that described itself as one in the 
documentation encountered during analysis, confirmed via a reliable source 
familiar with the entity, or via Internet research. A tribal college or university 
was defined as a campus on American Indian/Alaska Native sovereign land.

 ¶ College and university campus types were not mutually exclusive. Campuses could be categorized as multiple campus types and counted more than once (e.g., 
private and community college) and therefore could sum to more than the total. A public college or university was defined as a campus funded by government 
means. A private college or university was defined as a campus not funded by government means. A community college was defined as a campus with “community 
college” in the name, or described itself as one in the documentation encountered during analysis, or a reliable source confirmed this status. A historically black 
college or university was defined as a campus that described itself as one in the documentation encountered during analysis or a reliable source has confirmed 
this status. A tribal college or university was defined as a campus on American Indian/Alaska Native sovereign land.
 ** Indicated as a subset or percentage of smoke-free campuses.
A total of 1,616 public college and university campuses were 
smoke-free. Among these public campuses, 1,375 (85.1%) 
were tobacco-free; 1,373 (85.0%) specifically prohibited 
e-cigarette use; and 692 (42.8%) specifically prohibited hookah 
smoking. Among the 448 private campuses with smoke-free 
policies, 350 (78.1%) were tobacco-free; 282 (63.2%) specifi-
cally prohibited e-cigarette use; and 159 (35.5%) specifically 
prohibited hookah smoking. Among the 1,209 community 
college campuses with smoke-free policies, 1,066 (88.2%) were 
tobacco-free; 1,018 (84.2%) specifically prohibited e-cigarette 
use; and 459 (38.0%) specifically prohibited hookah smoking. 
Among the 58 historically black college or university campuses 
with smoke-free policies, 42 (72.4%) were tobacco-free; 37 
(63.8%) specifically prohibited e-cigarette use; and 28 (48.3%) 
specifically prohibited hookah smoking. Among the 18 tribal 
campuses with smoke-free policies, all 18 were tobacco-free; 
two (11.1%) specifically prohibited e-cigarette use; and three 
(16.7%) specifically prohibited hookah smoking. By state 
or territory, the number of college and university campuses 
with a smoke-free policy ranged from one in Hawaii and the 
Northern Mariana Islands to 108 in California and North 
Carolina (Table 2).
Discussion
In September 2012, the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, the University of Michigan, and the 
American College Health Association collaboratively launched 
the Tobacco-Free College Campus Initiative to promote 
and support the voluntary adoption and implementation of 
tobacco-free policies at universities, colleges, and other institu-
tions of higher learning across the United States. At the time, 
774 colleges and universities were identified as having a smoke-
free campus policy, 562 (72.6%) of which were tobacco-free.§§ 
The findings from this study indicate that, as of November 
2017, the number of campuses with smoke-free or tobacco-free 
policies had risen to 2,082 and 1,743, respectively, suggesting 
that the number of U.S. college and university campuses with 
such policies has more than doubled over the past half-decade. 
Smoke-free and tobacco-free policies at colleges and universi-
ties can help reduce secondhand smoke exposure, tobacco use 
initiation, and the social acceptability of tobacco use (1–3).
These results include campuses that might be smoke-free or 
tobacco-free because of policies at the institutional, local, state, 
or territorial levels. Healthy People 2020 objective TU-13.17 
monitors the number of states and the District of Columbia 
that have enacted laws that prohibit smoking on college and 
university campuses.¶¶ As of 2017, four states (Arkansas, 
Illinois, Iowa, and Louisiana) and the Northern Mariana 
Islands have enacted laws requiring smoke-free policies that 
prohibit smoking in all indoor and outdoor areas of public col-
lege campuses (4,5). Among these smoke-free laws, Arkansas’s 
law specifically prohibits e-cigarettes, Illinois’s law specifically 
prohibits e-cigarettes and hookahs, and the Northern Mariana 
Islands’ law specifically prohibits e-cigarettes and smokeless

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Cigarette smoking causes an estimated 480,000 U.S. deaths 
annually, including 41,000 from secondhand smoke exposure. 
Nearly all adult cigarette smokers start smoking before age 
26 years, making smoke-free and tobacco-free policies at 
colleges and universities important.
What is added by this report?
As of November 2017, at least 2,082 U.S. colleges and universi-
ties had smoke-free policies, twice as many as in 2012. Among 
these campuses, 1,743 (83.7%) had tobacco-free policies and 
some specifically prohibited electronic cigarette use (1,658 
[79.6%]) and hookah smoking (854 [41.0%]).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Efforts to monitor, promote, implement, and enforce smoke-
free and tobacco-free policies in U.S. colleges and universities 
can help reduce the prevalence of tobacco product use and 
secondhand smoke exposure among those who learn, live, 
work, and gather in these environments.
Given the trajectories of tobacco product use and initiation 
among young adults, interventions targeted toward this popula-
tion, including tobacco-free and smoke-free policies in colleges 
and universities, might help accelerate efforts to reduce tobacco 
product use among young persons (1,2).
This study is subject to at least four limitations. First, these 
data might include policies that have been formally adopted but 
are not yet in effect. Second, whereas ANRF’s database is the 
only national repository of smoke-free campus policies, these 
policies are not collected systematically from all campuses in 
the United States and therefore might not contain all policies 
that currently exist. Third, ANRF’s database does not capture 
the total number of U.S. college and university campuses; 
comparable data would be needed to present the percentage 
of U.S. campuses with smoke-free or tobacco-free policies and 
to estimate the percentage of students protected. Finally, there 
is no uniform method for ascertaining how rigorously these 
policies are enforced. Previous research suggests that although 
tobacco-free campuses have increased in recent years, policy 
restrictiveness, implementation, and enforcement vary (8).
The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that there is no 
risk-free level of secondhand smoke (9), and the public health 
benefits of smoke-free policies are well established in the sci-
entific literature (1). Smoke-free and tobacco-free campuses 
can promote the health and well-being of a diverse intersection 
of students, faculty, staff members, and guests by protecting 
nonusers from the harmful effects of secondhand tobacco 
product emissions, reducing the social acceptability of tobacco 
product use, preventing tobacco use initiation, and promot-
ing cessation (1,2,9). Continued efforts to monitor, promote, 
implement, and enforce smoke-free and tobacco-free policies in 
U.S. colleges and universities, in coordination with continued 
implementation of proven population-based interventions and 
tobacco product regulation (10), can help reduce the burden 
of tobacco product use among those who learn, live, work, 
and gather in these environments (1,2,9).
