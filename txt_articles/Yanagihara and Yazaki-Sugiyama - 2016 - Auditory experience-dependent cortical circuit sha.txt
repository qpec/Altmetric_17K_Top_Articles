Auditory experience-dependent cortical circuit
shaping for memory formation in bird song learning
Shin Yanagihara1 & Yoko Yazaki-Sugiyama1
As in human speech acquisition, songbird vocal learning depends on early auditory
experience. During development, juvenile songbirds listen to and form auditory memories of
adult tutor songs, which they use to shape their own vocalizations in later sensorimotor
learning. The higher-level auditory cortex, called the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), is a
potential storage site for tutor song memory, but no direct electrophysiological evidence of
tutor song memory has been found. Here, we identify the neuronal substrate for tutor song
memory by recording single-neuron activity in the NCM of behaving juvenile zebra finches.
After tutor song experience, a small subset of NCM neurons exhibit highly selective
auditory responses to the tutor song. Moreover, blockade of GABAergic inhibition, and sleep
decrease their selectivity. Taken together, these results suggest that experience-dependent
recruitment of GABA-mediated inhibition shapes auditory cortical circuits, leading to sparse
representation of tutor song memory in auditory cortical neurons.

ensory experience shapes neural circuits in early postnatal
development1,2, contributing to higher cognitive functions,
such as learning, in later developmental stages. In rodents,
auditory experience-dependent neuronal plasticity has been
well-studied2,3; however, it has not been possible to link that
plasticity directly to affective cognitive function. In human speech
development, the capacity for phonetic detection depends upon
auditory experience in early life4, and this experience restricts
later language learning. As in human speech acquisition,
songbirds learn complex vocalizations based on early auditory
experience. In the early sensory learning phase, juvenile zebra
finches listen to and memorize a tutor song (normally their
fathers’ song), and in the subsequent sensorimotor learning phase
they match their vocalizations to the memorized tutor song via
auditory feedback. This suggests that early auditory experience
with the tutor song in the sensory learning phase can shape
auditory cortical circuits in the juvenile zebra finch brain,
presumably to form a memory of the song, and this memory
may regulate later sensorimotor learning in the ‘song system’.
However, it remains unclear how and where the tutor song
memory is formed in the juvenile brain based on auditory
experience.
A growing body of evidence suggests that the caudomedial
nidopallium (NCM, a functional homologue of the mammalian
higher-level auditory cortex) is one of the possible storage sites of
tutor song memories5–7. Pharmacological blockade of molecular
signalling pathways in higher auditory cortical areas, including
the NCM, severely impairs imitation of the tutor song in juvenile
birds8. In adult birds, lesions in the NCM disrupt tutor song
memory-related behaviours, such as recognition of the tutor
song9 and recovery from vocal changes induced by aversive
reinforcement10. Furthermore, studies of immediate early gene
expression11–13 as well as electrophysiological recordings from
head-restrained awake birds14–16 imply that the NCM may
contain neural substrates of the tutor song memory. To date,
however, there is no direct electrophysiological evidence to show
that neurons in the NCM represent memorized tutor songs in
juvenile birds.
In this study we aimed to determine whether and how the
memorized tutor song is represented in the songbird auditory
cortex, that is, the NCM. We recorded the activity of single
neurons in the NCM from behaving juvenile zebra finches before
and during song learning. After exposure to a tutor song, a subset
of NCM neurons showed highly selective auditory responsiveness
to the experienced tutor song. Furthermore, the selectivity of
auditory responses was decreased by blocking GABAA receptor-
mediated
inhibition.
These
results
suggest
that
auditory
experience with the tutor song shapes neuronal circuits in the
NCM, presumably through recruitment of GABAergic inhibitory
circuits and that the tutor song memory may be represented in a
subset of NCM neurons.
Results
Tutor experience shapes auditory cortex neuronal selectivity.
To explore the neuronal representation of tutor song memory,
we chronically recorded extracellular single-unit activity from the
zebra finch auditory cortical area, that is, the NCM, before and
during song learning in the tutored birds (n ¼ 340 auditory
responsive neurons, 50–92 days post hatching, 20 birds),
as well as from age-matched isolated control birds (n ¼ 318
auditory responsive neurons, 55–80 days post hatching, 5 birds)
(see Methods section). As shown in a previous study17, we found
at least two types of neurons in the NCM, broad-spiking (BS) and
narrow-spiking (NS) neurons (Fig. 1a), which differed in spike
width (Fig. 1b, BS neuron: 0.50±0.08 ms, n ¼ 469; NS neuron:
0.21±0.05 ms, n ¼ 189 (mean±s.d.), Mann–Whitney U-test,
Po0.001) as well as in their spontaneous firing rates (Fig. 1c,
BS neurons: 1.59±3.54 spikes s � 1, NS neurons: 10.7±10.1
spikes s � 1 (mean±s.d.), Mann–Whitney U-test, Po0.001), as
previously reported17. Because there were no differences in spike
shape between tutored birds and isolated control birds, data from
both groups were pooled.
Interestingly, these neurons showed different auditory response
properties,
especially
after
tutor
song
experience.
Various
behaviourally relevant sound stimuli (nine stimuli), including a
tutor song (TUT), the bird’s own song (BOS), conspecific songs
(CON), and a heterospecific Bengalese finch song (HET), were
presented from a loudspeaker (see Methods section), and neural
responses to each stimulus were quantified in terms of response
strength (RS), which is the difference between the mean firing
rate during the sound stimulus and that during the pre-stimulus
baseline period. We further assessed the neuronal discriminability
of sound stimuli by calculating d values between two sound
stimuli18. If d values for all comparisons between a specific
stimulus and other sound stimuli were greater than 0.5, then the
neurons were categorized as specific song-selective neurons (see
Methods section). Although response habituation with repeated
auditory stimuli in the NCM has been reported14–16, we did not
see it in our recording conditions (chronic recording from freely
behaving birds). Neither was it observed for TUT or for other
songs in either BS or NS neurons. Before tutoring, both BS (93%)
and NS (100%) neurons responded equally well to most sound
stimuli (Figs 2b, 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). With
2 weeks of tutor experience, birds could learn from TUT as their
song similarity to TUT reached appropriate levels by adulthood8,19,
which is in contrast to the birds that were isolated until adulthood
and whose song similarity to TUT remained low (Supplementary
Fig.
1a–c).

(Figs 2b, 3c,d). The emergence of auditory selective BS neurons
did not seem to be an exclusive effect of TUT auditory experience,
as a significant number of BS neurons in the age-matched control
birds that had no TUT experience showed selective responses to
specific songs, although the proportions of selective neurons,
especially for TUT, were smaller (Fig. 2b, isolated). By contrast,
most NS neurons (96%) recorded from tutored birds still
responded non-selectively to multiple sound stimuli (Fig. 2b;
Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). To further evaluate the response
selectivity of each neuron, we quantified the sound stimuli to
which each neuron responded using the following equation:

 selectivity index (SI) ¼ 1 � (n/total number of song stimuli),
where n is the number of auditory stimuli that drive statistically
significant auditory responses (Po0.05). As a population, the SI of
BS neurons was significantly higher than that of NS neurons,
regardless of tutoring experience (Supplementary Fig. 3).
In birds with tutor experience, subsets of BS neurons showed
selective responses to experienced songs. Before tutor experience,
no TUT-selective BS neurons were identified (0/29), whereas after
tutoring in the same birds, 13% of BS neurons (27/207) were TUT
selective (Fig. 2b). In isolated birds that lacked tutor song
experience, TUT (paternal song)-selective BS neurons were rarely
recorded (2/233) in the same age period, even though they had BS
neurons that showed selective responses to other songs (17%,
39/233), suggesting that emergence of TUT-selective neurons
depends on TUT experiences. The proportion of TUT-selective
BS cells after tutoring was significantly higher than before
tutoring, and also higher than in control birds (w2-test, Po0.001,
df ¼ 2). Notably, in addition to emergence of TUT-selective
neurons, spike responses to TUT became precisely time-locked
to specific syllables of TUT (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Fig. 4).
TUT-selective neurons also showed nearly exclusive responses to
TUT (Figs 3c,d, 4a,d, RS for the TUT and other songs, 5.50±0.64
and 0.29±0.09, respectively, mean±s.e.m., Kruskal–Wallis test,
Po0.001, n ¼ 27 neurons, 10 birds). Among 27 TUT-selective BS
neurons, 15 showed weak, but significant responses to one or two
other sound stimuli (no. of other sound stimuli that evoked
significant responses ¼ 1.9±0.4, mean±s.e.m.). The remaining
12 TUT-selective BS neurons responded exclusively to the TUT,
which produced a very high SI (0.72±0.18, mean±s.e.m).
Importantly, TUT-selective BS neurons did not respond even to
the BOS, although in other brain areas important for song
learning, called the ‘song system’, responses to the TUT were
usually accompanied by responses to the BOS18,20. In addition to
TUT-selective BS neurons, a distinct subset of BS neurons showed
exclusive responses to the BOS after tutoring. Previous studies
have demonstrated that neurons in the song system show
apparent BOS-selective auditory responses18,21–26. In the song
system most neurons show responses biased towards the BOS; by
contrast, we found that only 12% of BS neurons (25 out of 207 BS
neurons) selectively responded to the BOS in the NCM after
tutoring (Fig. 2b). Immature developing BOS, which were
recorded at two different time points before electrophysiological
recording started, were selected as song stimuli (old BOS and new
BOS, recorded 47±8 days and 60±8 days (mean±s.d.)). Some

 BS neurons responded to either the old or the new BOS (10 out of
25 BOS-selective BS neurons), while other neurons responded
equally well to both songs (5 out of 25). The remaining
BOS-selective BS neurons (10 out of 25) showed selective
responses to one type of BOS and weaker, but significant
responses to other sound stimuli (no. of other sound stimuli
that evoked significant
responses ¼ 2.5±0.5, mean±s.e.m.).
BOS-selective neurons were also recorded in isolated birds
(11/233; new BOS selective: eight neurons, old BOS selective:
two neurons, new/old BOS selective: one neuron) in the similar
percentage with recordings in before tutoring birds (1/29). Those
percentages were significantly lower than in after-tutoring birds
(Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 5, w2-test, 0.01oPo0.02, df ¼ 2).
As seen in TUT-selective neurons, BOS-selective neurons were
highly biased towards the old and/or new BOS (Fig. 4b,e)
regardless of tutor experience, thus yielding a high SI value in
both tutored and isolated birds (0.67±0.18 and 0.75±0.16,
respectively). Moreover, we found another subset of BS neurons
(nine out of 207 BS neurons) that selectively respond to both the
TUT and the BOS (TUT/BOS-selective neurons), but not to other
stimuli (Figs 2b, 4c,f, RS for TUT, new BOS, old BOS and other
stimuli; 3.62±0.96, 4.61±2.00, 5.18±2.86 and 0.51±0.14,

Kruskal–Wallis
test,
Po0.001,
n ¼ 9 neurons, seven birds), as reported in lateral magnocellular
nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN) neurons18,20 in
tutored birds. While the percentage of TUT/BOS-selective
neurons in after tutored birds was small and there was no way
to evaluate classification of selective neurons, it was significantly
higher than that recorded in isolated control birds (1/233, w2-test,
0.005oPo0.01, df ¼ 1). Using a microdrive, neurons were
recorded from the NCM along with the dorso-ventral axis
within
a
depth
of
0.8–1.8 mm
(Supplementary
Fig.
1f).
Song-selective
neurons
were
found
throughout
the
entire
recording site with no correlation between the song type for
which the neurons were selective, and their depth.
TUT selectivity emerges with auditory not motor experiences.
Neurons in the LMAN, which is necessary for song learning,
respond to TUT in proportion to the amount of song learning,
and not to transiently learned tutor songs20, suggesting that they
respond to songs that are similar to their own vocalizations. We
further assessed whether TUT-selective responses of BS neurons
in the NCM reflect auditory experience, or the level of motor
mimicking. The birds’ songs became more similar to TUT along
with the time after tutoring; however, the proportion of
TUT-selective neurons found in each time period after tutoring
was almost constant (Fig. 5c). Moreover, there was no correlation
between the similarity of BOS (recorded within 3 days of
electrophysiological recording) to TUT and RS to TUT (Fig. 5b),
nor was there any correlation between the amount of song
learning from TUT (similarity at the final song) and the
proportion of TUT-selective neurons in a given bird (Fig. 5a).
Furthermore, there was no correlation between the similarity of
BOS to the stimulus song (CON) and the RS to that song
(Fig. 5b). These observations suggest that auditory selective
responses to a specific song in NCM do not represent vocal motor
learning.
Rather,
it
suggests
that
TUT-selective
responses
represent auditory TUT experiences and the memories formed
from those.
We
then
investigated
how
auditory
experience
altered
physiological properties of NCM neurons. After TUT experience,
about a half (43%, Fig. 2b) of BS neurons showed selective
neuronal responses to specific song stimuli. Interestingly, the
spontaneous firing rate of these selective BS neurons was
significantly lower than that of non-selective BS neurons,
regardless of the song stimulus to which each neuron selectively
responded (Fig. 6a–c). Selective neurons have lower spontaneous
firing rates and responded exclusively to a specific song, whereas
non-selective neurons responded equally well to all stimuli
with higher spontaneous firing rates. Furthermore, with tutor
experience, both non-selective BS-neurons and NS neurons

 (Fig. 6d,e). Interestingly neither decreased spontaneous firing of
selective neurons nor increased auditory responses in non-
selective neurons were provoked by auditory experience with
birds’ own songs (isolated birds). This implies that auditory
experience
with
TUT
(not
their
own
songs
nor
other
vocalizations) alters and differentiates a subset of selective
neurons to form a memory for song learning.
GABA circuits sharpen song selectivity in the NCM. Selective
neuronal responses have been well characterized in sensory
cortical networks27,28, and increases in response bias from less
biased inputs by local GABAergic inhibitory interneurons have
also been reported29. In the zebra finch auditory cortex, the
NCM, approximately half of the neurons are GABAergic30,
and blocking GABAergic inhibition results in alterations in
song-evoked responses17,31. Moreover, decreased spontaneous
firing rates in selective BS-neurons with TUT experience might
be caused by recruiting tonic GABA inhibitory inputs. Thus,
we examined the role of GABAergic inhibition in experience-
dependent selective responses to learned songs in the NCM by
blocking GABAergic inhibition with local injections of the
GABAA receptor antagonist, gabazine. We found that after
local gabazine injection (200 nl of a 1 mM solution in saline),
TUT-selective BS neurons became responsive to other song
stimuli that originally did not evoke significant responses, though
the responses still remained biased to TUT (Fig. 7a,b). Similarly,
BS neurons selective for the BOS, TUT/BOS or other sounds
decreased their response selectivity after local GABA inhibition
was blocked, whereas a control saline injection did not affect
response selectivity (Fig. 7c, left panel, SI, pre, 0.86±0.02,
gabazine, 0.62±0.07, recovery, 0.80±0.03, Wilcoxon signed-rank
test, Po0.005, n ¼ 10 neurons, 6 birds, right panel, pre,
0.85±0.02,

0.87±0.02,

n ¼ 6).
Neuronal
responsiveness increased after gabazine injection with both
preferred and non-preferred stimuli (RS for preferred stimulus,
pre, 3.76±1.10, gabazine, 4.62±1.12, 0.34P40.1, RS for
non-preferred stimulus, pre, 1.26±0.46, gabazine, 2.14±0.42,
Po0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test (one-tailed)). Gabazine
application did not change the spontaneous firing rate in
these neurons (pre, 0.51±0.24, post, 0.61±0.26, P40.2). This
suggests
involvement
of
non-selective
inhibitory
auditory
input into selective neurons that masks small non-preferred
auditory responses, as seen in the sensory tuning of cortical
neurons29,32,33. In contrast, gabazine injection did not change
response selectivity in non-selective NS neurons (Fig. 7d, left

Arousal state modulates song selectivity. In mammalian sensory
cortices, sensory processing is markedly influenced by an animal’s
arousal state34,35. Furthermore, a recent study showed that
anaesthesia leads to an imbalance of excitation and inhibition in
the primary visual cortex, making orientation tuning under
anaesthesia broader than during wakefulness36. By contrast, in
songbirds, neurons in brain areas that are necessary for song
production and learning respond to BOS playback under
anaesthesia or during sleep, but do not respond in awake
animals26,37–42. We investigated whether and how song selectivity

 in the NCM is modulated by arousal state. We found that arousal
states strikingly altered the selectivity of NCM neurons in a
cell-type-specific manner (Fig. 8). Song-selective BS neurons
responded to a greater number of song stimuli while birds
were
sleeping
normally
under
darkness
(Fig.
8a,b).
This
state-dependent selectivity modulation was seen in selective BS
neurons regardless of the song to which the neurons were tuned,
but it was not observed in non-selective BS or NS neurons
(Fig. 8c, SI, selective BS neurons, awake, 0.80±0.02, sleep,

modulated by behavioural states in a cell-type-specific manner.
Discussion
Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence that a memory of
an experienced tutor song is represented in a subset of auditory
cortical neurons in zebra finch brain. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating sharply tuned
tutor song-selective neurons in the juvenile songbird brain during
natural behaviour. Following auditory experience with a tutor
song, we found that a subset of BS neurons in the NCM exhibited
lower spontaneous firing rate and highly selective auditory
responses to the tutor song, suggesting that auditory experiences
shape auditory cortical circuits of juvenile birds and that the
memory of the tutor song is represented in a small, specific subset
of neurons.
Our findings strongly support the notion that the NCM is a
storage site of tutor song memory. Various studies using different
experimental approaches have suggested that the NCM is a
potential locus of tutor song memory. Blockade of molecular
signalling pathways in the NCM prevent normal vocal learning in
juvenile birds8, and lesions in the NCM in adult birds disrupt
behaviours related to tutor song memory9,10. Electrophysiological

 presentations of the tutor song and conspecific songs14–16.
Furthermore,
there
are
positive
correlations
between
the
strength of song learning and the level of immediate early gene
expression in the NCM upon hearing a tutor song12,13. Here, we
demonstrate that after tutor song experience, a small subset of
neurons of one cell type in the NCM showed highly selective
auditory responses to the experienced tutor song. We also found
another subset of neurons of the same cell type that selectively
responded to the BOS, in strong contrast to the song system,
where most neurons show a biased response to the BOS. Neither
the proportion of TUT-selective neurons recorded in NCM, and
RS to TUT showed correlation with the amount of vocal learning
from TUT. This suggests that emergence of TUT-selective
neurons is caused by TUT auditory experience, and not by
vocal motor learning. Furthermore, TUT, but not BOS auditory
experience decreased the spontaneous firing of one subset of BS
neurons. On the other hand emergence of selective neurons itself
did not depend on TUT auditory experience as BOS-selective and
other song-selective neurons were also found in isolated control
birds in the higher percentage than in before tutoring birds. These
results suggest that in addition to normal development, TUT
song, not BOS auditory experience, modifies intrinsic neuronal
properties of selective BS-neurons or local GABA inhibitory
circuits to form a TUT memory. These neurons modified by
auditory experience might regulate later motor learning. Further
experiments will be necessary to identify possible mechanisms for
differentiating selective neurons in which auditory memories are
held, and to determine how TUT memory within them is
associated with subsequent motor learning.
In mammalian sensory cortices, GABAergic inhibition plays
an important role in sensory tuning29,32,33, and the balance of
excitation and inhibition regulates the temporal precision of spike
responses43. Moreover, GABAergic transmission, as well as
GABA-mediated inhibitory short-term plasticity in the auditory
cortex, matures in relation to auditory experience44,45. During
early development, experience-dependent refinement of the
excitation–inhibition balance occurs in the primary auditory
cortex and contributes to maturation of cortical circuits46. As in
primary auditory cortical neurons in mammals, we show that
selective auditory response in higher order auditory cortical
neurons, acquired as a result of TUT auditory experience,
is
regulated
by
local
GABA
inhibition
in
zebra
finches.
Pharmacological blockade of local GABA inhibition decreased
the response selectivity of song-selective BS neurons without
changing their spontaneous firing rates, though their responses
still remained biased. That suggests involvement of non-selective
inhibitory auditory input to TUT-selective neurons (Fig. 9), while
slightly biased responses after GABA blockade still suggests
possible
involvement
of
biased
afferent
inputs
(either
by
weakening of non-preferred or by strengthening of preferred
input). Together, here we suggest that common features of
sensory experience-dependent neuronal plasticity in cortical
circuits1–3 occur with TUT auditory experience in the zebra
finch auditory cortex, and that GABA-mediated sensory tuning
contributes to auditory template formation in zebra finch song
learning. Further studies on TUT auditory experience-dependent
GABA circuit development in zebra finch auditory cortex would
provide us further insights.
In this study, we also showed that song-selective BS neurons
were markedly modulated by the arousal state of the bird.
Song-selective BS neurons showed decreased response selectivity
while the birds were asleep. Previous studies have shown that
behavioural states strongly modulate auditory responses in song
system nuclei. Neurons in the HVC and RA in the song system,
as well as those in the NIf, interface of the auditory and vocal
motor systems47, robustly respond to the BOS during sleep or

 under anaesthesia, but not during wakefulness26,37–42. Gating of
auditory responses by arousal state can be seen in the selective
response to the BOS within song system nuclei, but not in the
primary auditory cortex (field L), where neurons do not show
selective responses to a specific song37. Here, we found state-
dependent modulation of selectivity of auditory responses in the
NCM. Song-selective BS neurons showed markedly decreased
selectivity
while
birds
were
asleep.
On
the
other
hand,
responsiveness to each song itself, not selectivity, increases
during sleep, consistent with previous studies. In mammalian
sensory cortices, behavioural states markedly modulate sensory
processing34 and regulate activity of inhibitory interneurons in a
subtype-specific manner, which consequently leads to modulation
of animal behaviour48. Furthermore, a recent study of the mouse
primary visual cortex showed that anaesthesia (or sleep) leads
to an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, making
orientation tuning during the anaesthetized state broader than
that during wakefulness36. Similar mechanisms of brain state
regulation
of
cortical
activity
might
explain
increased
responsiveness in the NCM. Direct or indirect inputs from the
NCM to the song system can also modulate responses there.

Our study provides clear electrophysiological evidence of
the presence of sharply tuned tutor song-selective neurons,
representing auditory memory of TUT in the higher auditory
cortical area of juvenile zebra finches. We also suggest how early
auditory tutor experience shapes cortical circuits of avian brain
during song learning. At this stage, it remains unclear whether
tutor song-selective or BOS-selective neurons in the NCM
contribute to later sensorimotor learning. To determine how
these song-selective neurons interact with other interrelated brain
areas to guide sensorimotor learning will be an important future
direction toward understanding neural mechanisms underlying
sensorimotor learning in early development.
Methods
Subjects and experimental design. Experiments were performed in accordance
with experimental protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee at Okinawa
Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) Graduate University. Twenty-five male
juvenile zebra finches (20 tutored and 5 isolated), born and reared in our colony,
were used in these experiments. Birds were raised in cages with their parents and
siblings. Then, at 10–12 days of age, the father was removed, and siblings were
reared with their mothers in sound-attenuating boxes until 31–35 days of age,
when they were individually isolated. Thereafter, male juvenile birds were housed
individually in sound-attenuating boxes, and at 53–62 days of age, birds underwent
surgery for electrode implantation. After recovering from surgery, single-unit
activity was recorded to determine auditory responsiveness (before tutoring). After
several neural recordings, juvenile birds were housed together with a tutor bird for
2 weeks, except during the period of electrophysiological recordings (tutored birds).
So as not to disrupt learning of the tutor song, neural recordings were started more
than 5 days after tutoring, and were continued until birds reach adulthood (80±8.6
days) (after tutoring). Five birds were kept isolated, and periodically recorded
electrophysiologically (islolated birds). We also performed electrophysiological
recordings in 6 juvenile birds (54–85 days of age) that were reared with their
parents (father and mother) and siblings in our colony room until 50 days of age,
and then isolated in recording boxes. Electrophysiological data obtained from these
birds, with respect to the ratio of tutor song-selective or BOS-selective neurons,
were comparable to those from birds that were isolated and then tutored. Thus,
data from colony reared birds were included in the same analysis.
Surgery and electrophysiological recording. We recorded single-unit neuronal
activity from the NCM in freely behaving male juvenile zebra finches52. Two
tetrode wire electrodes (nichrome wire, diameter, 12.5 mm,impedance, 300–500 kO,
Kanthal Palm Coast) and one reference electrode attached to a microdrive were
implanted into the NCM using stereotaxic coordinates (anterior: 0.5 mm, lateral:
0.5 mm from the bifurcation of the sagittal sinus) under isoflurane anaesthesia
(1.3%), and fixed to skulls with dental cement. After recovery from anaesthesia,
juvenile birds can freely move with implanted electrodes. Juvenile birds were wired
to the amplifier only during neuronal activity recordings. Neuronal recordings were
done 5–8 h per day, every day from 4 days before until 38 days after tutoring,
except the first 1–5 days of tutoring, to give juvenile birds enough time to learn the
song. Using a microdrive, recordings were obtained from 0.8 to 1.8 mm in depth.
To assess bird arousal states, we monitored EEG activity from the brain surface
through a stainless steel wire. Power spectral density of EEG signals was calculated
using Welch’s method, and sleep state was defined by occurrence of strong EEG
power at low-frequency range (less than 10 Hz)53. Most of the time, single-unit
neuronal activity was recorded in awake behaving birds, and in some cases,
neuronal units were also recorded in the same birds while they were asleep
(35 units from 11 birds, aged 55–87 days). Neuronal signals were amplified 5,000 or
10,000-fold and EEG signals were amplified 1,000-fold. Neuronal and EEG signals
were band-pass filtered at 0.5–9 kHz and 0.7–170 Hz, respectively, digitized (40 and
20 kHz for neuronal and EEG signals, respectively) with the Plexon MAP system,
and stored on a PC. Sound stimulation was presented from a speaker, and neuronal
responses were recorded simultaneously with the presentation of sound stimuli.
We also monitored each bird’s vocalizations during electrophysiological
recordings. Spike sorting was performed off-line using the Offline Sorter (Plexon),
and well-isolated single units were submitted to subsequent analysis with MATLAB
(MathWorks). After completion of electrophysiological recordings, electrical
lesions were made (20 mA for 20 s), and recording and drug injection sites were
histologically verified (Supplementary Fig. 1e,f).
Song recording and analysis. BOS were recorded using an Avisoft recorder
(Avisoft Bioacoustics). The BOS was recorded twice interval of 46 days (old BOS,
49±9 days, new BOS, 64±9 days, mean±s.d.). These recordings were used as
song stimuli for electrophysiological experiments. Song stimuli included a TUT, the
old BOS, a new BOS, 2 different conspecific adult zebra finch songs (CON1,
CON2), a HET, an adult male zebra finch call (Mcall), an adult female zebra finch
call (Fcall), and white noise (WN). These were presented 10 times from a loud-
speaker in a semi-random order with an inter-stimulus interval of 4 s. To evaluate
the degree of vocal learning after tutoring, song similarity of a bird’s song recorded
at adulthood (135±5 days of age), and their tutors’ songs were measured
(%similarity) using SAP 2011 (ref. 19). For each bird, 10 song motifs were
measured for their similarity to the tutor’s song motif, which was used for song
playback during electrophysiological recordings, and averaged (Supplementary
Fig. 1c). For isolated birds, song similarity to their genetic father’s song motif,
which was also used for electrophysiological recordings, was measured.

Figure 9 | Experience-dependent GABA inhibitory circuit recruitment in
zebra finch auditory cortical circuits. Before learning, a BS neuron (open
circle) receives various non-selective auditory inputs (song-1, song-2 and
song-3). At this stage, GABA inhibition is still immature. Tutor song
experience matures GABAergic inhibitory circuits, which suppress unbiased
auditory inputs (song-2 and song-3), leading to selective responses to a
song experienced by the bird (song-1) in a specific BS neuron (closed circle,
after tutor song experience). After blocking GABAergic inhibition or during
sleep, which would cause weak inhibition, the song-selective BS neuron
becomes responsive to other auditory inputs.

 Electrophysiological data analysis. Neurons that showed a significantly higher
firing rate during the song stimulus than during the pre-stimulus baseline period
(Po0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-tailed, unless otherwise noted)) during
at least one song stimulation were submitted to further analysis. We classified
neurons based on the mean spike width and the duration from negative to positive
peak, using 30 spike examples for each neuron. The auditory responses of each
neuron were quantified by response strength (RS), which represents the difference
in mean firing rate during the sound stimulus and during a pre-stimulus
baseline period. To further assess the response bias between two sound stimuli,
we calculated d values using the following equation:
d � primea � b ¼ 2 RSa � RSb

where RS is the mean response strength to the stimulus and s2 is the variance of
the RS (ref. 18). As in previous studies54,55, d-prime40.5 was used as a criterion
for biased response, since it represents an RS to the biased stimulus 42 � as great
as that to other stimuli18. If d value comparisons between a specific song and all
other songs were greater than 0.5, the neuron was categorized as selective for that
specific song. In cases where the absolute d value for TUT-BOS was o0.5, and a
neuron exhibited significant responses to both TUT and BOS
(new BOS and/or old BOS), but not to others, a neuron was classified as
‘TUT/BOS-selective’ (Fig. 4c,f). We further assessed to how many song stimuli each
neuron responded to by calculating the selectivity index: 1 � (n/total number of
song stimuli), where n is the number of auditory stimuli that drive statistically
significant auditory responses (Po0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
Pharmacological experiments. To assess the role of GABAergic inhibition
in neural responses, the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (SR95531,
Sigma-Aldrich) was locally injected during neural recordings. For drug injection
experiments, a cannula was implanted along with the tetrodes. Gabazine was used
at 1 mM because that concentration did not induce seizure-like neural activity in
our preliminary experiments. The single-unit activity was isolated, and auditory
responses to the song stimuli were recorded. Then, a bird was placed in the
stereotaxic apparatus, and gabazine (200 nl of a 1 mM solution in saline) was locally
injected through the guide cannula over a period of 5 min (KDS 310 Nano Pump,
KD Scientific). The bird was returned to the recording chamber, and auditory
responses of the same single unit were again recorded at 20 min (gabazine
condition) and at 1 h after injection (recovery condition). In control experiments,
the same amount of saline was injected, and electrophysiological recordings were
performed before and after injection.
