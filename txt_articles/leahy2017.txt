BACKGROUND: Little is published on patient blood
management (PBM) programs in hematology. In 2008
Western Australia announced a health system–wide
PBM program with PBM staff appointments commencing
in November 2009. Our aim was to assess the impact
this program had on blood utilization and patient
outcomes in intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia
or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective
study of 695 admissions at two tertiary hospitals receiving
intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or undergoing
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between July
2010 and December 2014 was conducted. Main
outcomes included pre–red blood cell (RBC) transfusion
hemoglobin (Hb) levels, single-unit RBC transfusions,
number of RBC and platelet (PLT) units transfused per
admission, subsequent day case transfusions, length of
stay, serious bleeding, and in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: Over the study period, the mean RBC units
transfused per admission decreased 39% from 6.1 to 3.7
(p < 0.001), and the mean PLTunits transfused
decreased 35% from 6.3 to 4.1 (p < 0.001), with mean
RBC and PLTunits transfused for follow-up day cases
decreasing from 0.6 to 0.4 units (p < 0.001). Mean pre-
RBC transfusion Hb level decreased from 8.0 to 6.8 g/dL
(p < 0.001), and single-unit RBC transfusions increased
39% to 67% (p < 0.001). This reduction represents blood
product cost savings of AU$694,886 (US$654,007).
There were no significant changes in unadjusted or
adjusted length of stay, serious bleeding events, or in-
hospital mortality over the study.
CONCLUSION: The health system–wide PBM program
had a significant impact, reducing blood product use and
costs without increased morbidity or mortality in patients
receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
P
atient blood management (PBM) is an evidence-
based bundle of care that optimizes medical and
surgical patient outcomes by clinically managing
and preserving a patient’s blood.1 PBM and the
establishment of PBM programs is a matter of global
interest.2-4 Factors driving this interest include supply
challenges, increasing costs, and most importantly, safety
challenges and limited evidence for benefit.2 There is also
a large body of literature demonstrating transfusion to be
associated with adverse outcomes2,5-8 in a wide range of
patient populations including those undergoing chemo-
therapy for acute myeloid leukemia.9 The implementation
of PBM programs, particularly in surgical patients, is asso-
ciated with reduced transfusion utilization, improved
patient outcomes, and reduced costs.10

 practice,11 there are few publications on the impact of a
PBM program in hematology patients. Attitudes among
physicians have been slow to change.12,13 This may be
due to a longstanding concern among hematologists that
the hemoglobin (Hb) should be maintained higher than
9 g/dL in intensive chemotherapy to avoid adverse out-
comes such as increased bleeding and cardiovascular
compromise, the preferred option being to administer 2-
unit transfusions rather than multiple single-unit transfu-
sions.14 Traditionally, patients were transfused 2 units of
red blood cells (RBCs) as 1 unit was considered insuffi-
cient to correct anemia.15 Changing this ingrained prac-
tice pattern has proved difficult. More recent studies have
shown little change in the attitude of physicians with less
than 10% of intensivists and no hematologists considering
single-unit transfusions in various clinical scenarios.16,17
In November 2008 the Western Australia Department
of Health announced the implementation of a sustainable
health system–wide PBM program.2 This was undertaken
in a jurisdiction that had one of the lowest RBC transfu-
sion issuance rates in the developed world. The program
sought to change transfusion practice from a “product
focus” to a “patient focus” with a view to improving
patient outcomes while reducing costs.1,18 This required a
culture change at all levels of the health care organiza-
tion.1 In the four major adult tertiary care hospitals in the
state of Western Australia, program implementation was
associated with significant reductions in RBC, fresh-
frozen plasma (FFP), and platelet (PLT) utilization and
was concurrently associated with hospital-wide significant
risk-adjusted reductions in mortality, morbidity, and hos-
pital length of stay, while saving millions of dollars.1
Here we present the impact of a health system–wide
PBM program on hematology patients in two tertiary hos-
pitals of the South Metropolitan Health Service of Western
Australia. Although the programs within these hospitals
did not specifically focus on hematology patients, we
hypothesized that they would have broad impact on prac-
tice in all specialties. The aim of this study was to report
on any changes in transfusion practice and outcomes in
patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute
leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
autologous and allogeneic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Program implementation
The PBM program was announced in November 2008 and
was to be phased in over 5 years. Dedicated PBM staff,
including a PBM medical director and a PBM nurse coor-
dinator, were to be appointed in the first year at all major
tertiary care hospitals in the state and servicing all area
health services. Experience has shown these positions are
key to the success of PBM programs. However, the global
financial crisis resulted in delays of staff appointments,
with the
first appointments
commencing
November
2009.1,2,19
One of the hospitals in our health service (Hospital 1)
appointed their PBM program staff in November 2009.20
The second tertiary hospital (Hospital 2) appointed their
PBM medical directors in December 2012 and their PBM
nurse in February 2013.
The program incorporated principles of the Kotter
model for culture change.1 Clinical implementation of the
program was built around the “three pillars” concept of
PBM, namely, optimize the patient’s RBC mass, minimize
blood loss, and harness and optimize the patient’s physio-
logic anemia reserve. In surgical patients this is applied in
the pre-, intra-, and postoperative phases, illustrated as a
three-pillar, nine-field matrix.2 In nonsurgical specialties,
including hematology, this is applied in the pretreatment,
treatment, and posttreatment phases.18
In the early phase of the jurisdiction-wide program,
efforts focused on achieving clinical engagement and uti-
lizing practice change educational initiatives. PBM educa-
tional road shows were conducted in all major hospital
departments including surgical, critical care, trauma,
medical, obstetrics, neonatology, hematology, and oncol-
ogy. Presentations included PBM definition and program
rationale, drivers for urgent change in practice, evidence
for inappropriate use of blood products, the triad of inde-
pendent risk factors for adverse patient outcomes (ane-
mia, blood loss, and transfusion), the three pillars of PBM
to modify the risk factors, updates on current specialty-
specific literature on PBM, evidence-based PBM guide-
lines, and department-specific benchmarking.1
No specific transfusion thresholds were established for
the program. Transfusion decisions were encouraged to
take into account patient-specific clinical and physiologic
factors and accept evidence-based, more restrictive but
individualized thresholds. A single-unit RBC transfusion
policy was adopted in symptomatic, nonactively bleeding
anemic patients.12,20-22 Details of program rationale and
implementation strategies, including computerized pre-
scriber order entry for blood products and informed con-
sent/refusal for transfusion, are reported elsewhere.2,20,23
Data sources
Data included in this study were extracted retrospectively
from electronic databases. We obtained data from the
South Metropolitan Health Service Clinical Activity Data
Warehouse, the Western Australian Patient Blood Manage-
ment Data System, and the hospital Pharmacy Manage-
ment
System
(i.Pharmacy,
Computer
Sciences
Corporation). Inpatient admissions and subsequent day
case presentations to two tertiary hospitals between July
2010 and December 2014 were analyzed. July 2010 was
selected as the start date as this was the first full year data

 needed for this study were available from all electronic
data sources. Patients were included in this study if they
received intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or
underwent a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allogeneic
or autologous) and were treated as inpatients at the two
study hospitals. Our study was registered with the relevant
hospital governance units and, given its nature, was consid-
ered exempt from human research ethics committee
review.
Outcome measures
Outcomes captured included number of units of RBCs
and PLTs transfused. FFP was not included as few patients
in our patient population receive FFP
. Those who do are
administered FFP for a specific reason, namely, bleeding
or severe coagulopathy. Other outcomes were number of
RBC transfusions administered as a single unit, pre-RBC
transfusion Hb value, pre-PLT transfusion PLT counts,
total hospital length of stay, serious bleeding, and in-
hospital mortality. To assess bleeding events we extracted
ICD-10 codes for gastrointestinal, genitourinary, respira-
tory, and intracranial hemorrhage. These codes were for
hemorrhage and therefore interpreted as “serious.” Poten-
tial confounders such as patient age and patient comor-
bidities were included in the analysis of in-hospital
mortality, length of stay, and serious bleeding. To assess
the impact of the PBM program over time, the exposure
measured was the discharging Australian financial year
(July 1 to June 30), with July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 as the
baseline comparator.
Comorbidities were measured using the Charlson
Comorbidity Index (CCI). The CCI is a comorbidity score
used to grade a patient’s level of disease at admission and
is widely used in clinical research. Our CCI application
was based on the Quan method.24
We defined an RBC transfusion event as any RBC
units transfused within a 6-hour window. If within this 6-
hour transfusion event window there is 1 unit of RBCs
transfused this is identified as a single-unit transfusion. If
2 units are transfused within this window this is identified
as a double-unit transfusion. As a surrogate, the PBM data
system uses Hb values to determine possible bleeding sta-
tus for patients not achieving an appropriate incremental
increase in Hb level after transfusion.
Product cost savings are based on prices provided by
the National Blood Authority (Australia). The product costs
are the prices the National Blood Authority has charged
jurisdictions under national blood arrangements.25
Statistical analysis
Unadjusted results were analyzed using the chi-square
test for categorical variables and the independent-samples
t test for mean differences between continuous variables.
Linear regression was used to test the relationship
between year of admission and mean pretransfusion Hb.
A zero truncated negative binomial regression was used to
model changes in hospital length of stay, and logistic
regression tested the changes in proportion of single-unit
transfusions, serious bleeding, and in-hospital mortality.
Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the rate
of blood units transfused per admission between years
and to calculate the rate ratios and test their significance.
RESULTS
Our data set contained 695 inpatient admissions over a
4.5-year period (Table 1). The mean age at admission was
49.3 years (SD, 614.7 years) and 373 (53.7%) were male.
Inpatients were transfused 3384 units of RBCs and 3639
units of PLTs. Inpatients transfused a single unit of RBCs

 had a mean Hb increase of 1.2 g/dL (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.1-1.2 g/dL), while those transfused 2 units
of RBCs had a mean Hb increase of 2.0 g/dL (95% CI, 1.9-
2.0 g/dL).
Of the units of PLTs transfused 99% (n 5 3591) were
apheresis PLTs and 1% (n5 48) were pooled. The mean
pre–PLT transfusion PLT count was 13 3 109/L and the
mean post–PLT transfusion PLT count was 26 3 109/L.
Figure 1 highlights the decreasing trend in mean pre-
RBC transfusion Hb level from 8.0 g/dL in 2010-2011 to
6.8 g/dL in the first half of 2014-2015 (p < 0.001) for inpa-
tients at the study hospitals. The decrease was significant for
the years 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and the first half of 2014-
2015 when compared with the baseline year 2010-2011.
Also represented in Fig. 1 is the increase in single-unit
RBC transfusions. The proportion increased from 39% in
2010-2011 to 67% in the first half of the 2014-2015 year (p <
0.001). The greatest change in single-unit RBC transfusion
rate occurred in 2011-2012 for Hospital 1, increasing from
63% in 2010-2011 to 89% (p < 0.001). The greatest change
in Hospital 2 was in 2013-2014, increasing to 46% from 23%
(p < 0.001) in the previous year.
During the study period there was a significant reduc-
tion in the mean RBC units transfused (Fig. 2) per inpa-
tient admission. The rate decreased from 6.1 units per
admission in 2010-2011 to 3.7 units per admission in the
first half of 2014-2015 (p < 0.001). Compared with the
2010-2011 year the rate ratio for units of RBCs transfused
per admission for 2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and
the first half of 2014-2015 were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.69-0.85),
0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.92), 0.74 (95% CI, 0.67-0.82), and 0.61
(95% CI, 0.54-0.68), respectively.
When compared with 2010-2011, there was also a sig-
nificant reduction in the subsequent RBC units transfused
per day case (Fig. 3). The mean rate decreased from 0.3
units per day case in 2010-2011 to 0.2 units per day case
in the first half of 2014-2015 (p < 0.001).
The mean number of PLT units transfused per in-
patient admission (Fig. 2) decreased significantly from 6.3
units in 2010-2011 to 4.1 units in the first half of 2014-
2015 (p < 0.001). Compared with the 2010-2011 year the
rate ratio for units of PLTs transfused per inpatient admis-
sion for 2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and the first
half of 2014-2015 were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.81), 0.87 (95%
CI, 0.79-0.95), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.77-0.94), and 0.65 (95% CI,
0.57-0.73), respectively. The mean threshold for the
administration of PLTs decreased significantly from 14 3
109 to 11 3 109/L (p < 0.001).
The subsequent numbers of PLT units (Fig. 3) trans-
fused per day case were significantly higher in 2013-2014,
at a mean of 0.3 units per day case, when compared with
2010-2011 at 0.2 units per day case (p 5 0.002). In all other
years the rate remained unchanged.

 Across the study period, the total reduction in in-
patient and day case transfusions translates to 1111 fewer
RBC units and 588 fewer PLT units. This represents direct
product cost savings of AU$389,537 (US$364,177) and
AU$305,349 (US$289,830), respectively.
We observed a nonsignificant reduction in unad-
justed mean length of stay over the study period from 24.5
days in 2010-2011 to 22.6 days in the first half of 2014-
2015 (p 5 0.338). After patient age, patient group, and
comorbidities were adjusted for, this reduction in length
of stay remained nonsignificant (incident rate ratio, 0.88;
95% CI, 0.75-1.04). The unadjusted proportion of episodes
with a serious bleed increased from 5.3% in 2010-2011 to
7.0% in the first half of 2014-2015; however, this was not
significant (p 5 0.582). After patient age, patient group,
and comorbidities were adjusted for, the odds ratio (OR)
for a serious bleed was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.38-3.44; p 5 0.811).
There was a nonsignificant decrease in hospital mortality
from 5.3% in 2010-2011 to 2.0% in the first half of 2014-
2015 (p 5 0.218). After patient age, patient group, and
comorbidities were adjusted for, the OR for in-hospital
mortality was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.06-1.56; p 5 0.154).
DISCUSSION
The comprehensive PBM program in Western Australia
was associated with a significant reduction in blood
product use in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy
for acute leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplan-
tation without adverse outcomes. These results from a
“real-world” nonclinical trial setting26 demonstrate signifi-
cant decreases in RBC and PLT units transfused and mean
pre-RBC transfusion Hb thresholds, and a significant
increase in proportion of single-unit RBC transfusions.
There are multiple factors that can influence length of
stay and mortality in this patient group. These include
neutropenic sepsis, bleeding, and disease progression.
The significant reductions in Hb thresholds for RBC trans-
fusion and RBC and PLT utilization were not associated
with an increase in subsequent day case transfusions,
length of stay, serious bleeding, or in-hospital mortality.
Increased utilization of single-unit RBC transfusion
correlated with the employment of PBM staff at each hos-
pital. The 2012-2013 financial year was the first year both
hospitals had all their PBM staff appointed. In that year,
the
single-unit
RBC
transfusion
rate
increased
significantly.
Little has been published on PBM initiatives in hema-
tology. In 2011 Hofmann and colleagues13 reviewed the lit-
erature on PBM in surgical patients and proposed that
lessons learned in the surgical patient population may be
applied with benefit in the hematology-oncology patient
population. In 2012 Berger and colleagues12 published a
retrospective cohort study comparing single- and double-
unit RBC transfusion policies in patients receiving inten-
sive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplan-
tation.
This
study
showed
no
increase
in
adverse
outcomes with single-unit transfusions and transfusion
thresholds of 6.0 g/dL or less. There was no increase in
bleeding or PLT use in the single-unit cohort. Their change
in RBC transfusion policy from double-unit to single-unit
in patients with hematologic malignancies led to a 25%
reduction in RBC units transfused per therapy cycle.
Our data showed similar results. In the two tertiary
hospitals there were significant increases in single-unit
transfusions and the mean number of RBC units trans-
fused per admission decreased 39% compared to the
baseline year. However, where Berger and colleagues12
found no change in PLT utilization, we observed a 35%
reduction in the mean number of PLT units transfused per
admission.
This reduction in PLT utilization was an unexpected
finding. There was a significant reduction in the mean
PLT count threshold for PLT transfusion but this may
only partially explain the reduction. The PBM program
placed great emphasis on physicians thinking carefully
about the transfusion decision and it is possible that this
had a Hawthorne effect on practice.27 The publication of
studies in 2013 confirming the value of prophylactic PLT
transfusions in this patient group may also have had an
effect on practice.28 A number of studies have shown an
increase in rebleeding with liberal RBC transfusion

 thresholds and a dose-dependent association between
any RBC transfusion and rebleeding in acute upper gas-
trointestinal bleeding.29-32 Sieunarine and colleagues33
described the activation of plasma and cellular systems
in RBC storage that may contribute to coagulopathy.
However, our data did not suggest any decrease in coa-
gulopathy and bleeding due to lower RBC transfusion
rates.
Blumberg and colleagues34 observed a dose-dependent
association between PLT units transfused and decreased
survival in patients undergoing induction therapy for acute
leukemia. Patients receiving lower numbers of PLT transfu-
sions had significant risk-adjusted improved survival. Can-
nas and colleagues9 reported an independent association
between RBC and PLT frequency and poorer survival during
initial presentation and induction chemotherapy in patients
with acute myeloid leukemia. These findings are consistent
with our data, demonstrating an association with decreased
blood product utilization and a trend toward improved sur-
vival. Larger real-world data are needed to provide further
insights regarding this association.
The reductions in units transfused represent product
acquisition cost savings of AU$389,537 (US$364,177) for
RBCs and AU$305,349 (US$289,830) for PLTs. These fig-
ures, however, do not describe the total cost savings. One
multicenter study determined the activity-based costing
(ABC) of RBCs was three to five times higher than the
product acquisition cost.35 In our study this would repre-
sent savings of between AU$1,246,518 and AU$1,869,777
(US$1,165,367 and US$1,748,051) for RBCs alone. While
the ABC of FFP has been determined to be more than
nine times the acquisition cost,36 the ABC of PLTs is
unknown. However, when adding PLT product costs
alone, the total estimated cost savings in our patient
group would be between AU$1.6 and AU$2.2 million
(US$1.5 and US$2.0 million).
Our results highlight that the Western Australia PBM
program’s impact was not restricted to surgical patients.
The program engaged all surgical and nonsurgical disci-
plines and, although not specifically focusing on hematol-
ogy,
was
associated
with
significant
changes
in
transfusion practice in patients receiving intensive che-
motherapy either for acute leukemia or hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation.
Our study has limitations. As an observational study
we can only demonstrate an association between imple-
mentation of a jurisdiction-wide PBM program and out-
comes in this patient population. However, we found a
temporal association consistent with findings from the
overall impact of the program on blood utilization.2,10 The
CCI and bleeding were identified from ICD-10–coded
data. For accurate measurement, good clinical documen-
tation and precise translation into ICD-10 codes by pro-
fessional coders are necessary. Despite these potential
limitations
the
ICD-10
coded
data
are
audited
for
accuracy and completeness and are widely used to assess
clinical practice and outcomes.
Another limitation is the absence of data in our elec-
tronic database on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, intra-
venous (IV) iron, and antifibrinolytic agents. Other stem
cell transplantation programs have used strategies to mini-
mize or avoid RBC transfusion including erythropoiesis-
stimulating agents and IV iron to maximize hematopoiesis,
minimal blood sampling to minimize blood loss, and
hemostatic agents to mitigate bleeding risk.37 The health
system–wide PBM program included strategies to optimize
the patient’s RBC mass and reduce blood loss; however, we
were not able to assess these in this study and it is the sub-
ject for future research.
The implications for practice are substantial. Clinical
hematology is one of the biggest consumers of blood
products.38-40 Any changes in transfusion practice within
this patient population are likely to have a large impact on
product inventory, hospital transfusion laboratory pro-
cesses, and health service resources.5,41
In conclusion, the overall outcomes of the Western
Australia PBM program are made up of the work of indi-
vidual specialties and departments. This study is the first
to examine the impact of a jurisdiction-wide PBM pro-
gram in clinical hematology.
The implementation of a health system–wide PBM
program was associated with significant reductions in
RBC and PLT transfusions in patients receiving intensive
chemotherapy for acute leukemia or undergoing hemato-
poietic stem cell transplantation without an associated
increase in morbidity and mortality. With the aging popu-
lation there is an increasing incidence of hematologic
malignancy requiring transfusion support.38 Implementa-
tion of PBM programs in this patient population is likely
to have a substantial impact on overall hospital and juris-
dictional blood utilization and health service costs.5,42
