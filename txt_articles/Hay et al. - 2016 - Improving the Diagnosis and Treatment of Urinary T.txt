Improving the Diagnosis and Treatment of Urinary Tract 
Infection in Young Children in Primary Care: Results 
from the DUTY Prospective Diagnostic Cohort Study
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Up to 50% of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young children are 
missed in primary care. Urine culture is essential for diagnosis, but urine collec-
tion is often difficult. Our aim was to derive and internally validate a 2-step clini-
cal rule using (1) symptoms and signs to select children for urine collection; and 
(2) symptoms, signs, and dipstick testing to guide antibiotic treatment.
METHODS We recruited acutely unwell children aged under 5 years from 233 
primary care sites across England and Wales. Index tests were parent-reported 
symptoms, clinician-reported signs, urine dipstick results, and clinician opinion 
of UTI likelihood (clinical diagnosis before dipstick and culture). The reference 
standard was microbiologically confirmed UTI cultured from a clean-catch urine 
sample. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver opera-
tor characteristic (AUROC) curve of coefficient-based (graded severity) and points-
based (dichotomized) symptom/sign logistic regression models, and we then 
internally validated the AUROC using bootstrapping.
RESULTS Three thousand thirty-six children provided urine samples, and culture 
results were available for 2,740 (90%). Of these results, 60 (2.2%) were positive: 
the clinical diagnosis was 46.6% sensitive, with an AUROC of 0.77. Previous UTI, 
increasing pain/crying on passing urine, increasingly smelly urine, absence of 
severe cough, increasing clinician impression of severe illness, abdominal tender-
ness on examination, and normal findings on ear examination were associated 
with UTI. The validated coefficient- and points-based model AUROCs were 0.87 
and 0.86, respectively, increasing to 0.90 and 0.90, respectively, by adding dip-
stick nitrites, leukocytes, and blood.
CONCLUSIONS A clinical rule based on symptoms and signs is superior to clini-
cian diagnosis and performs well for identifying young children for noninvasive 
urine sampling. Dipstick results add further diagnostic value for empiric antibi-
otic treatment.

INTRODUCTION
T
he accurate and timely diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) 
in children is important to alleviate short-term suffering1 and pre-
vent the possible long-term consequences, such as renal scarring, 
impaired renal growth, recurrent pyelonephritis, impaired glomerular 
function, hypertension, end-stage renal disease, and preeclampsia.2-4 
Guidelines universally recommend microbiological confirmation using 
urine samples collected by clean catch (preferred in Europe),5 catheteriza-
tion, or suprapubic aspiration for unwell children where clean catch is not 
immediately available (preferred in the United States6 and Australia7).
There are 3 possible explanations why one-half of UTIs are not diag-
nosed at the earliest opportunity in UK primary care.8 First, relevant 
evidence in primary care regarding which children should be suspected 
of having a UTI is scarce. Guidelines, which emphasize the importance

of fever,6,7,9 are largely informed by studies conducted 
in emergency departments.10-12 Second, the symptoms 
and signs of UTI are often nonspecific, especially in 
very young children. Finally, obtaining an uncontami-
nated sample can be challenging, time-consuming, 
and, for invasive catheter- and suprapubic aspiration-
sampling methods, painful13 and frightening,14 and they 
may induce infection.15
We report a large, prospective cohort study 
designed to investigate the diagnostic features of UTI 
in young children in primary care. Our aim was to 
develop and internally validate a 2-step clinical rule: 
step 1 used symptoms and signs to select children for 
urine sampling, and step 2 (once urine was obtained) 
used symptoms, signs, and dipstick testing to guide 
empiric antibiotic treatment. Coefficient- and points-
based clinical rules were developed for use with and 
without computer assistance.
METHODS
Design
Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infection in Young children 
(DUTY) was a multicenter, prospective, diagnostic 
cohort study that recruited children seeking care at 
National Health Service (NHS) primary care sites. 
General practitioners, nurses, and children’s emer-
gency department physicians (from here on clinicians) 
working in primary care sites (general practice clinics, 
emergency departments, and walk-in centers) are those 
who provide primary care for children. Primary care 
site clinicians were recruited, and the staff were trained 
by 4 United Kingdom center hubs (Bristol, Cardiff, 
London, and Southampton).
 Ethical approval was granted by the South West 
Southmead Research Ethics Committee, ref #09/
H0102/64. 
Participants
Children were eligible if aged under 5 years and with 
complaints of any acute (less than 28 days) illness epi-
sode, where the illness was associated with (1) at least 
1 constitutional symptom or sign identified by the 
National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence 
(NICE)5 as a potential marker for UTI (fever, vomiting, 
lethargy/malaise, irritability, poor feeding, and failure 
to thrive), and/or (2) at least 1 urinary tract symptom 
identified by NICE5 as a potential marker of UTI 
(abdominal pain, jaundice in children aged younger 
than 3 months, hematuria, offensive urine odor, cloudy 
urine, loin pain, frequency, apparent pain on passing 
urine, and changes to continence). As a result, constitu-
tionally unwell children consulting with an apparently 
obvious cause for their symptoms (such as acute otitis 
media or bronchiolitis, without a urinary symptom) 
were included. Children were excluded if they were 
constitutionally well (eg, acute conjunctivitis only), had 
a neurogenic or surgically reconstructed bladder, had 
a permanent or intermittent urinary catheter, reported 
trauma as the main problem, or had been taking anti-
biotics within 7 days. Clinicians, aided by research 
nurses where available, were asked to recruit consecu-
tive eligible children, and where it was not possible, 
to log children’s age and sex (Supplemental Appendix, 
Figure 1, http://www.annfammed.org/content/14/4/325/
suppl/DC1).
Index Tests and Urine Collection
Subsequent to consent, results of 107 index tests (symp-
toms, signs, and dipstick results, Supplemental Appen-
dix, http://www.annfammed.org/content/14/4/325/
suppl/DC1) were recorded on a standardized case 
report form by qualified clinicians blinded to the ref-
erence standard. Parent-reported items included the 
child’s medical history and symptoms. Signs gathered 
from a full clinical examination included clinicians’ 
global illness severity impression and abdominal tender-
ness. Before urine dipstick testing, clinicians recorded 
their rating of UTI likelihood (clinical diagnosis).
Our preferred urine collection method was clean 
catch. For toilet-trained children, we used a sterile 
bowl that the parent could hold under the child or 
put in a potty. For other children, the parent cleaned 
the diaper area using water alone and sat the child on 
their knee with the bowl placed under their perineum. 
If it was not possible to obtain a sample at the site, the 
parent was given equipment and advice on taking the 
sample at home. Where a clean catch was not feasible, 
we used NICE-recommended sterile urine collection 
pads (Newcastle SteriSet sterile urine collection packs) 
placed inside the diaper,5 but because of differences in 
contamination rates and children’s ages between clean-
catch and diaper pad samples, the current analysis 
focuses on clean-catch samples.
Urine samples were tested at the site using Sie-
mens/Bayer multistix 8SG dipsticks (Siemens Health-
ineers). Urine samples were split into 2 fractions for 
microbiological analysis. The priority fraction was 
sent to the site’s usual laboratory. When at least 1 
mL was left, the remainder was sent in boric acid 
monovettes using first-class postal Safeboxes (Royal 
Mail Group, Ltd) to the Public Health Wales Microbi-
ology Specialist Antimicrobial Chemotherapy Unit in 
Cardiff, UK (the research laboratory).
Reference Standard
The reference standard was determined at the research 
laboratory, which spiral plated (Don Whitley Sci-

entific) 50 μL of urine onto chromogenic agar and 
standard blood agar. Quantitative total counts were 
recorded for up to 6 organisms, and the presence of 
antimicrobial substances was measured. Two staff 
members processed the samples using a single, stan-
dardized procedure. According to UK guidelines,16 
our microbiological definition of UTI was either the 
pure (single) or predominant growth of a uropathogen 
(Enterobacteriaceae) at ≥105 colony-forming units (CFU)/
mL. We defined predominant growth as ≥105 CFU/mL 
of a uropathogen with a 3-log10 (1,000-fold) or greater 
difference between the growth of this and the next 
species. For comparison, we used the US definition6 of 
a pure uropathogen growth: >50,000 CFU/mL with a 
leukocyte count of ≥25/mm3 on microscopy or leuko-
cyte positive (threshold at nil/trace) on dipstick.
Sample Size Calculation
We assumed a candidate predictor prevalence of 10% 
and UTI prevalence of 2%.17 With 80% power and 
a 2-sided α of .05, 3,000 urine results were required 
to detect an odds ratio of 2.4, whereas 3,100 results 
would give a clinical rule with 80% sensitivity and a 
95% confidence interval width of 10%. We originally 
proposed to recruit 4,000 children with a target of 
recovering urine samples from at least 3,100 (77.5%) 
for clinical rule derivation and a further 2,000 chil-
dren for external validation. We did not anticipate, 
however, the need to stratify analyses by clean-catch 
and diaper pad collection methods. We therefore 
decided to use all available clean-catch results to 
derive the models, with internal bootstrap validation 
instead of external validation.
Summary of Statistical Analysis
A full description of statistical methods is given in the 
Supplemental Appendix (http://www.annfammed.org/
content/14/4/325/suppl/DC1). In summary, we first 
compared the age and sex of the children who were 
recruited with those children whose parents declined 
to participate. Then, using logistic regression, we 
estimated associations of index tests with positive 
urine cultures in 2 steps (reflecting clinical proce-
dure): in step 1 we used symptoms and signs to select 
children for urine sampling, and in step 2 (once urine 
was obtained) we used symptoms, signs, and dipstick 
testing to guide empiric antibiotic treatment. Coef-
ficient- and points-based clinical rules were developed 
for use with and without computer assistance. We 
quantified diagnostic accuracy using the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve 
with 95% confidence intervals and internally validated 
coefficient-based models using the bootstrap proce-
dure described by Steyerberg et al.18 Because children 
with fever of unknown origin is a group of particular 
clinical interest, we investigated the presence of UTI 
among children identified as having fever without 
symptoms or signs suggestive of another source. 
To assess the added value of dipsticks in addition 
to symptoms and signs alone, we (1) quantified the 
change in AUROC, and (2) used a simulation proce-
dure to calculate the change in the probability of UTI 
associated with addition of dipstick results. Finally, 
because UTI laboratory criteria differ between the 
United Kingdom and the United States, we calculated 
the prevalence- and bias-adjusted k statistic to assess 
agreement between UK and US UTI definitions.19 
We also used crude and adjusted odds ratios and the 
AUROC to assess strength of association and diagnos-
tic utility of index tests identified as diagnostic using 
the UK UTI definition.
RESULTS
Between April 2010 and April 2012, 516 staff (61 
research nurses, 182 general practitioners, and 273 site 
nurses) recruited participants from 233 primary care 
sites (225 general practices, 4 walk-in centers, and 4 
children’s emergency departments) across England 
and Wales. Of 14,724 children screened for eligibility, 
4,390 (43%) were ineligible, 1,276 (12.6%) declined 
participation, 1,880 (18.5%) could not be recruited for 
other reasons, and 15 (0.15%) withdrew. We had valid 
consent and index test data for the remaining 7,163 
(Supplemental Appendix Figure 2, http://www.annfa-
mmed.org/content/14/4/325/suppl/DC1), of whom 
6,797 (94.9%) were recruited in general practice sites, 
284 (4.0%) in children’s emergency departments, 
and 82 (1.1%) in walk-in centers. Urine was collected 
using diaper pads from 3,205 (reported in a separate 
article)20 and by clean catch from 3,036 children, 
with reference standard (research laboratory) results 
available for 2,740 (90%) of clean-catch samples. Of 
these 2,740 children, 2,561 (93.5%) were aged 2 years 
or older, and 1,473 (54%) were female (Table 1). The 
most common working diagnoses were upper respira-
tory tract infection (28%), viral illness (15%), otitis 
media (10%), and gastroenteritis (3.6%). One-third of 
samples arrived at the research laboratory within 24 
hours of collection. Transit time did not affect culture 
performance.
Sixty (2.2%) children had urine samples that met 
the laboratory definition for UTI: 50 (83.3%) Esch-
erichia coli, 5 (8.3%) Proteus species, 3 (5.0%) Klebsiella 
species, 1 (1.7%) Morganella morganii, and 1 (1.7%) 
Citrobacter farmeri. Of these samples, 2,627 (96%) were 
provided within 24 hours of the index test measure-
ment. Urinary antimicrobial substances were found in

128 (4.5%) samples and in 4 (6.7%) 
of the UTI-positive samples. A clini-
cal diagnosis of UTI before urine 
dipstick testing was made in 168 
(6.1%) children, of whom 28 (16.7%) 
were UTI positive. Clinical diagnosis 
achieved 46.6% sensitivity, 94.7% 
specificity, and an AUROC of 0.77 
(95% CI, 0.71-0.83). Missing data 
and not known responses were infre-
quent (Table 1).
Step 1. Symptoms and Signs
The parent-reported index tests 
associated with UTI in crude (Table 
1) and adjusted (Table 2) analyses 
were pain/crying while passing 
urine, smelly urine, previous UTI, 
and absence of severe cough. For 
the pain/crying while passing urine 
and smelly urine, there was a graded 
association with increasing symptom 
severity. Clinician-reported index 
tests associated with UTI were 
increasing illness severity (graded 
association), abdominal tenderness, 
and absence of ear abnormalities. 
None of the other index tests (Table 
1 of the Supplemental Appendix, 
http://www.annfammed.org/con-
tent/14/4/325/suppl/DC1) met our 
criteria for model inclusion, and 
there was no evidence of association 
for fever of unknown origin (Table 
3 of the Supplemental Appendix, 
http://www.annfammed.org/con-
tent/14/4/325/suppl/DC1) or prior 
illness duration (data not shown).
The multiple imputation-based 
AUROC for the coefficient-based 
step 1 model was 0.90 (95% CI, 
0.85-0.95, internally validated 
AUROC of 0.88, Table 2, Figure 
1). Table 3 (upper portion) shows 
diagnostic test characteristics (sen-
sitivity, specificity, positive and 
negative predictive values, percent-
age of children defined as positive) 
according to a range of cut points 
for the symptoms and signs model (for any combina-
tion of symptoms and signs, the linear predictor is 
obtained by adding the coefficients corresponding to 
those categories to the constant term in Table 6 of the 
Supplemental Appendix, http://www.annfammed.org/
content/14/4/325/suppl/DC1). To achieve sensitivities 
of 70% (all children with linear predictor of –2.729 
or greater) or 85% (linear predictor –3.717 or greater) 
with the step 1 model would require urine sampling in 
6.8% to 17.6% of children; with corresponding posi-

tive predictive values of 22.6% to 10.6% and specifici-
ties of 94.6% to 83.9%. Although the points-based 
model AUROC of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.81-0.90; validated 
AUROC = 0.85) (Table 2 of the Supplemental Appen-
dix, http://www.annfammed.org/content/14/4/325/
suppl/DC1) was similar to the coefficient-based model, 
other diagnostic parameters were inferior: using an 
85.0% sensitivity (a 3-point or greater cutoff) only 
increased the posttest probability to 6.9% with a lower 
specificity (74.4%) and higher (26.9%) urine collection 
rate (upper portion of Table 4, Supplemental Appen-
dix, http://www.annfammed.org/content/14/4/325/
suppl/DC1). Using a 5-point or greater cutoff (any 
3 of 5 symptoms and signs) increased the posttest 
UTI probability to 17.7%, with increased specificity 
(94.6%) and reduced urine collec-
tion rate (6.4%), but at the expense 
of reduced sensitivity (51.7%, upper 
portion of Table 4, Supplemental 
Appendix, http://www.annfammed.
org/content/14/4/325/suppl/DC1).
Urine samples were available for 
88, 91, and 612 children aged less 
than 12 months, 12 to 23 months, 
and 24 to 35 months, respectively, 
with laboratory confirmed UTI 
in 4, 2, and 16 of these children, 
respectively (Table 1). The coef-
ficient model performed well in 
children younger than 3 years, with 
similar estimated odds and AUROC 
(Table 5 of the Supplemental Appen-
dix, http://www.annfammed.org/
content/14/4/325/suppl/DC1).
Step 2. Symptoms, Signs, and 
Dipstick Testing
Dipstick leukocytes, nitrites, and 
blood were strongly associated 
with UTI (Tables 1 and 2). The 
coefficient-based, multiple imputa-
tion model AUROC was 0.93 (95% 
CI, 0.90-0.97, validated 0.90), an 
increase of 0.03 (P = 0.01) when 
dipstick results were added to symp-
toms and signs (Table 2, Figure 1). 
If all children had a urine sample 
and dipstick test, the dipstick test 
results could maintain sensitivity 
at 80% while improving specificity 
from 88.3% to 93.8% and reducing 
the percentage of children treated 
with antibiotics from 13.2% to 7.8%, 
assuming immediate antibiotic use 
(Table 3). The points-based model AUROC was 0.90 
(95% CI, 0.85-0.95, validated 0.89), and increased (by 
0.04, P < 0.01) when dipstick results were added to 
symptoms and signs (Table 2). Table 7 of the Supple-
mental Appendix (http://www.annfammed.org/con-
tent/14/4/325/suppl/DC1) shows there was a substantial 
impact on the probability of UTI associated with addi-
tion of dipstick test results to the step 1, with a median 
change in post-dipstick test probability of UTI of 9.9% 
(95% CI, 1.4%-55.5%).
Serious Adverse Events
Seventy-nine (1.1%) of the 7,163 recruited children 
were hospitalized; 3 related to dipstick testing (2 with 
UTI and 1 with diabetes).

Effects of Replacing US With UK Definition  
of UTI 
Data were available for all 2,740 (100%) children, 35 
(1.3%) of whom had findings that were UTI posi-
tive using the US definition of UTI . We found good 
agreement (prevalence- and bias-adjusted κ = 0.98), 
and crude and adjusted odds ratios were similar, com-
paring US and UK definitions of UTI , showing the 
same graded associations, except for severe cough US 
(adjusted OR = 0.74 (95% CI, 0.23-2.37) compared 
with 0.29 UK (95% CI, 0.09-.97), data available from 
the authors). Step 1 and step 2 diagnostic utilities 
were stable based on the US definition, with validated 
AUROCs of 0.88 and 0.93 respectively.
DISCUSSION
Summary of Findings
In a large cohort of young children with acute illness 
in primary care, 2.2% of clean-catch urine samples 
met the UK microbiological criteria for UTI. Based on 
data obtained from clean-catch samples, we developed 
novel coefficient (for computer use) and points-based 
clinical rules to help clinicians select children for urine 
sampling and antibiotic treatment with high diagnostic 
utility. For step 1, the coefficient-based rule was diag-
nostically superior to the points-based rule, which in 
turn was superior to clinical diagnosis. For step 2, dip-
stick testing was diagnostically superior to symptoms 
and signs alone (both coefficient and points-based 
rules), and was not diagnostically useful in children 
with the lowest UTI probability, for whom step 1 
would not result in urine collection.
Strengths and Limitations
To our knowledge, this study is the largest and most 
rigorous investigation of diagnostic accuracy of UTI 
in children aged under 5 years in primary care. The 
generalizability of the final sample is supported by the 
similarity between participating children and those 
invited but declining. We achieved high levels of data 
completeness across a large number of primary care 
sites and maintained blinding of recruiting staff to 
the reference standard. Index tests were measured 
according to routine clinical practice using standard-
ized reporting forms and equipment, and nearly all 
tests were completed within 24 hours of urine sample 
retrieval, minimizing disease progression bias. The 
low number of samples with 
antimicrobial substances mini-
mized treatment paradox. Our 
reference standard was specific 
to common uropathogens and 
excluded index tests. Two mem-
bers of the laboratory staff, 
blinded to all index tests but not 
age, performed the microbio-
logical cultures and interpreted 
results using a standardized 
process in a single laboratory. 
Our broad eligibility criteria 
allowed us to identify previously 
unidentified clinical features use-
ful for both increasing (smelly 
urine) and decreasing (absence of 
severe cough, normal ear exami-
nation) UTI probability, as well 
as to demonstrate the absence 
of diagnostic utility of other 
features (such as fever, fever of 
unknown origin, vomiting, leth-
argy, irritability, and poor feed-
ing) widely believed to be diag-
nostically useful.5,6 Our results 
are stable using the more conser-
vative US definition of UTI.
The main limitation is the 
relatively small number of UTI

diagnoses, especially in the youngest children, which 
had an impact on 3 areas. First, we were not able to 
externally validate our rules. Although external valida-
tion is desirable before clinical application, bootstrap 
validation takes account of model overoptimism. By 
analogy, it is reasonable for clinical practice to change 
on the basis of a single, high-quality, well-conducted 
randomized trial, though replication is desirable. That 
said, because we recruited from first-point-of-contact, 
primary care sites, we consider it necessary to evaluate 
the rule’s performance before use in secondary care. 
Second, our rule development breached the widely 
quoted “10 events per candidate predictor.” This rule 
of thumb, however, has little theoretical justification

and has been shown to be conservative,21 and the con-
sequences of variable selection are strongly dependent 
on the strength of association of candidate predictors 
with the outcome. Here, predictors of UTI are biologi-
cally plausible, and associations are substantial. Finally, 
children aged 2 years or younger are underrepresented 
in these analyses because of the difficulty of obtaining 
clean-catch samples in this age-group. We found our 
rule, however, to be diagnostically accurate in children 
aged under 3 years who are able to provide a clean-
catch urine sample. Our secondary care experience, as 
well as a recent report describing a bladder stimulation 
technique for infants,22 suggest that when sufficient 
time, space, and personnel are available, clean-catch 
sampling is possible in most young children.
We mitigated the impact of false-positive urine cul-
tures (arising as a result of asymptomatic bacteriuria23 
or contamination) using 3 design features. First, chil-
dren were eligible only if experiencing constitutional 
and/or urinary tract symptoms; second, the rule was 
developed using only clean-catch samples; and third, 
we used a single research laboratory, which used meth-
ods superior to NHS laboratories to distinguish con-
taminated urine. Incorporation bias could have inflated 
the AUROC for step 2 using the US definition of UTI, 
because dipstick leukocytes were used as both an index 
test and within the reference standard definition.
Results in Context with Other Studies
One systematic review of 8 primary studies (7,892 chil-
dren),24 and 5 primary studies10,11,25-27 of a further 18,796 
children (with only one study25 conducted in general 
practice surgeries) assessed UTI prevalence and the 
diagnostic value of clinical symptoms and signs in chil-
dren aged under 5 years.28 These studies found similar 
UTI prevalence and showed abdominal pain, back pain, 
dysuria, frequency, and new-onset urinary incontinence 
to be positively associated with UTI.24 Stridor, audible 
wheeze, circumcision, temperature less than 39°C with 
a source, abnormal chest sounds, chest crackles, aged 
under 3 years, not feeling hot, and rapid breathing were 
inversely associated with UTI. The largest study, which 
included 16,000 children coming to children’s emer-
gency departments, derived a complex model based on 
27 symptoms and signs, with an AUROC of 0.80 (95% 
CI, 0.78-0.82).26 The only previous study to recruit 
from general practice surgeries found that younger age, 
urinary frequency, and pain/crying on passing urine 
were associated with UTI, but it had an insufficient 
number of children with UTI to develop a clinical 
rule.25 Previous investigation of malodorous urine has 
shown conflicting results,27,29 but our study strongly 
supports its diagnostic value. Dipstick testing has been 
considered diagnostically unhelpful in young children.5
Clinical and Research Implications
In keeping with recently updated US guidelines,6 our 
results support a risk-based approach to the identifica-
tion of children for investigation of UTI. Pain or cry-
ing while passing urine, smelly urine, previous UTI, 
absence of severe cough, severe illness, abdominal ten-
derness, and absence of ear abnormalities can be used 
for deciding which children for whom a urine sample 
(step 1) and dipstick results would improve specific-
ity for antibiotic treatment (step 2). For both steps, 
increasing diagnostic sensitivity can be achieved by 
increasing urine-sampling rates, which may not be fea-
sible or affordable. Precisely how these results are used 
is likely to depend on clinician preference. Some clini-
cians may wish to use these as risk factors to feed into 
clinical judgment. Others may prefer to use a checklist 
approach and use the points-based clinical rules (Fig-
ure 2, which can be used without computer assistance), 
which focus attention on predictive factors rather than 
those (such as fever) with poor diagnostic utility. Cli-
nicians concerned about overdiagnosis and treatment 
could select a higher specificity threshold, whereas 
higher sensitivity thresholds would reduce underdiag-
nosis. When the rule is used, it should supplement, not 
replace, clinical judgment.
Further research is needed to distinguish pathogens 
from contamination and asymptomatic bacteriuria.23 
Given the expense of an external validation study and 
the low rates of routine urine sampling (which render 
routine data sets unsuitable), we consider the most 
cost-effective future research strategy would be to 
assess the impact of the DUTY clinical rule on clinical 
behavior and patient outcome in a randomized trial. 
The strongest design would integrate the presentation 
of the coefficient-based clinical rule within routine 
clinical care, probably via electronic medical records.
Our rule can be used to enhance current clini-
cal practice in the identification of young children 
for noninvasive urine sampling in primary care. Fever 
should not be used to stratify UTI probability, and 
dipstick testing can be used to improve specificity for 
empiric antibiotic treatment in this population.

Figure 2. DUTY (Diagnosis of Urinary Tract infection in Young children) clean-catch criteria.
How to use the DUTY Clean-Catch Urine Criteria
 
1. The DUTY Clean-Catch Urine Criteria are for children in whom a clean-catch sample is possible.
 
2.  
Urinary tract infection (UTI) was def
 ned as ≥105 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of a single or predominant uropathogen cultured 
from a clean-catch urine specimen.
 
3.  
Table A: Use the symptoms and signs to decide whether a clean-catch urine sample should be collected/antibiotics given (≥5 points or can 
be operationalized as ‘any 3 of the 5’ symptoms and signs has been shown to be cost-effective). Clinicians concerned about overdiagnosis and 
treatment can select a higher specif
 city (at least 6 points) threshold. Higher sensitivity thresholds (eg, ≥3 points or ≥4 points) would reduce 
underdiagnosis, but these thresholds have not been shown to be cost-effective.
 
4.  
It is not clear which of the following possible antibiotic treatment strategies is most cost-effective: (i) immediate presumptive treatment 
of all sampled children; (ii) immediate dipstick-guided treatment; or (iii) laboratory-guided (delayed) treatment.
 
5.  
For children with urine samples at the ≥5-point threshold, the probability of UTI will be 18% (Supplemental Appendix, Table 4, 
http://www.annfammed.org/content/14/4/325/suppl/DC1 [upper portion]). Although not demonstrably cost-effective, dipstick testing 
can raise or lower this probability (see Table B). 
 
6.  
Table B: refer to Supplemental Appendix, Table 3, http://www.annfammed.org/content/14/4/325/suppl/DC1 (lower portion) for probability 
of UTI with total score.
 
7.  
Consider advising the parents of all children (with and without urine samples) to seek medical advice if their child gets worse.
 
8.  
The DUTY Clean-Catch Urine Criteria are designed to supplement and not replace clinical judgment.
