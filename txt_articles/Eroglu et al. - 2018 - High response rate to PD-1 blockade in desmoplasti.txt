 Abstract
Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a rare subtype of melanoma characterized by dense fibrous 
stroma, resistance to chemotherapy and a lack of actionable driver mutations, but is highly 
associated with ultraviolet light DNA damage.1 We analysed 60 patients with advanced DM 
treated with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) blocking antibody therapy. 
Objective tumour responses were observed in 42 of the 60 patients (70%, 95% confidence interval 
57–81%), including 19 patients (32% overall) with a complete response. Whole-exome sequencing 
revealed a high mutational load and frequent NF-1 mutations (14 out of 17 cases). 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis from 19 DM and 13 non-DM revealed a higher percentage 
of PD-L1 positive cells in the tumour parenchyma in DM (p = 0.04), highly associated with 
increased CD8 density and PD-L1 expression in the tumour invasive margin. Therefore, patients 
with advanced DM derive significant clinical benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint 
blockade therapy despite being a cancer defined by its dense desmoplastic fibrous stroma. The 
benefit is likely derived from the high mutational burden and a frequent pre-existing adaptive 
immune response limited by PD-L1 expression.
Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) accounts for less than 4% of melanomas. It is characterized 
histologically by spindle-shaped melanoma cells within abundant collagenous stroma with 
scattered lymphoid aggregates, with a high mutational burden from ultraviolet light radiation 
damage.1 Anti-PD-1 antibodies have been approved in many countries for the treatment of 
advanced melanoma with an overall response rate of 33–40%.2 As recognition of 
neoantigens resultant from somatic non-synonymous mutations is associated with improved 
clinical responses to anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapy,3–6 we hypothesized that patients 
with DM may respond well to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapies due to the high mutational 
load.
We conducted a retrospective review of the pathology reports from 1058 patients with 
advanced melanoma treated with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies between 2011 and 
2016 at 10 international sites with high volume melanoma clinical trials. We identified 60 
patients with advanced unresectable DM who received PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy 
(Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). Thirty-seven patients (62%) had visceral metastases or 
elevated lactate dehydrogenase (M1c disease), which are recognized makers of poor 
prognosis.7 Histological sub-classification as pure (n = 25), mixed (n = 30) or indeterminate 
(n = 5) DM subtypes8 was reported by the local pathologists. All cases had the distinctive 
diagnostic features of DM with abundant connective tissue surrounding the tumour cells, 
which can be highlighted by Masson’s trichrome stain (examples in Figure 1a, with the 
collagenous stroma stained in blue). Central review of the H&E stains of 34 cases by two 
pathologists revealed that 65% of cases had a significant fibrous stroma (graded 2–3), and 
that 63% of cases demonstrated lymphoid aggregates within the tumour and/or at the tumour 
stromal interface (graded 1–3) (Supplementary Table 1). Forty-two patients (70%) had 
progressed after prior systemic treatment, most frequently with the cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
antigen-4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody ipilimumab (Extended Data Tables 1 and 
Supplementary Table 1). The most frequently administered anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 drug was 
pembrolizumab in 45 (75%) of patients, while eight (13%) received nivolumab, three (5%)

 the anti-PD-L1 antibody BMS-936559, and an additional three (5%) received a combination 
of nivolumab or pembrolizumab with ipilimumab.
With a median follow up of 22 months, 42 out of the 60 patients (70%, 95% Clopper-
Pearson confidence interval of 57 to 81%) had an objective response by RECIST 1.1 criteria 
(Figure 1b and c). This included 19 (32%) complete responses and 23 (38%) partial 
responses; nine patients with a partial response eventually progressed but none of the 
patients with complete response have progressed. When the four patients treated with a 
combination of anti-PD1 and ipilimumab were excluded, responses were seen in 38 out of 
56 (68%) patients. Three patients with isolated progression (including two who had a partial 
response) underwent surgery and subsequently had no evidence of melanoma with ongoing 
follow up for over 1.8, 5.2, and 5.3 years, respectively. Median progression free survival and 
overall survival have not been reached, with estimated 2-year overall survival of 75% (95% 
confidence interval 65–89) (Extended Data Figure 1a–b). For patients censored in the 
Kaplan-Meier curve, median follow-up was 27+ months. There were no statistically 
significant differences in either objective response rate (65% vs 70%), or overall survival 
between patients with the two DM histological subtypes, pure or mixed. There was also no 
difference in objective responses based on degree of fibrosis or presence of lymphoid 
aggregates (Supplementary Table 1).
Whole exome sequencing from 17 cases in our DM cohort revealed greater than 82% C>T 
transitions as part of a strong signature of ultraviolet light induced DNA damage that is 
common to cutaneous melanoma1,9 (Extended Data Figure 2a–b). There was no difference 
in mutational load comparing locally advanced and metastatic lesions (Extended Data Figure 
3a). Mutations in NF-1 in the absence of BRAF/RAS hotspot mutations were the most 
common driving genetic event (82.4%, 14/17 samples), along with an enrichment for loss-
of-function mutations in TP53 and ARID2 (Figure 2a, Extended Data Figure 3b), similar to 
previously published series of DM.1,10 These features are also characteristic of NF-1 
subtype melanoma, which makes up 8–12% of cutaneous melanoma cases in large cohorts 
and has more than double the mutational load of NRAS, BRAF or triple wild-type subtypes.
11–13 Our DM series had similar mutational load to NF-1 subtype cases (regardless of 
histological classification) in a combined series from two reports of patients with anti-PD-1 
treated advanced melanoma14,15 and in TCGA data. In all three series, NF-1 mutated cases 
had significantly greater mutational load than the non-NF1 subtypes, but there was no 
difference on response to PD-1 blockade (Figure 2b). Patients with DM without a response 
(n=5) showed no difference in mutational load compared with patients with a response (rank 
sum p = 0.87, Figure 2b), a finding which is also true of two previous anti-PD1 treated 
cohorts14,15, in contrast to what has been reported in patients with melanoma treated with 
anti-CTLA416 (Extended Data Figure 3c) or patients with lung and bladder cancer treated 
with anti-PD-1/L1 therapy.3,6 We did not find any genes mutated more frequently in patients 
with DM with or without response to therapy (Extended Data Figure 4a), including when 
doing specific analyses for potential detrimental mutations in the interferon receptor 
pathway or B2M that may result in innate or acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy 
(Extended Data Figure 4b).14,17

 We evaluated whether the presence of CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 in DM was associated with 
response to anti-PD1/L1 therapy18,19 using 19 available pre-treatment DM tumour biopsies 
compared to 13 non-DM samples (seven with a complete or partial response, six with 
progressive disease) using digital quantitative IHC. S100 expression was used to define the 
invasive tumour margin (stromal-tumour edge) and inside tumour parenchyma (tumour 
centre) (examples in Extended Data Figure 7f.). Overall, biopsies of patients with DM had a 
strikingly higher percentage of PD-L1 positive cells in the tumour parenchyma when 
compared to non-DM cases (p = 0.04, Figure 3a), confirming the same observation when 
analysing primary DM lesions.20 There were no significant differences in the density of 
CD8+ cells in the tumour parenchyma, or CD8+ and PD-L1+ cells in the invasive margin (p 
= 0.12, p = 0.41, p = 0.16, Figure 3b, 3c and 3d). Consistent with our previous 
observations18, the strongest correlation with clinical benefit (defined as having a complete 
or partial response, or prolonged stable disease for >12 months) was baseline density of 
CD8+ T cells in the invasive margin in non-DM melanoma (p=0.002, Extended Data Figure 
5a–d).
In DM samples, PD-L1 expression in the tumour parenchyma was significantly associated 
with CD8 density (p=0.007) and PD-L1 expression in the invasive margin (p=0.0003), but 
not with CD8 density inside of the tumour parenchyma (p=0.15, Extended Data Figure 6). 
Similarly, PD-L1 expression in the invasive margin was significantly associated with CD8 
density in the invasive margin (p=0.0003), CD8 density in the tumour parenchyma (p=0.04), 
and PD-L1 expression in the tumour parenchyma (p=0.0003). Among DM cases for which 
we had exome sequencing, we did not detect many of the genetic mechanisms reported to 
cause constitutive PD-L1 expression, including amplification of the PD-L1/PD-L2/JAK2 
(PDJ) locus or MYC, EGFR mutation or amplification, or CDK5 disruption.21–24 The PD-
L1 3′ UTR was not well captured in our exome sequencing, and disruption could not be 
assessed.25 Therefore, the higher PD-L1 expression in DM is likely due to a reactive 
response to CD8 T cell infiltrates reflective of adaptive immune resistance.26
We noted five different patterns of CD8+ cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression in the 
invasive margin and tumour parenchyma, with most patients responding to therapy having 
one of the three patterns characterized by high CD8+ T cells (12 out of 14 with DM and six 
out of seven with non-DM, Extended Data Figure 7a–e). Patients without a tumour response 
tended to have low CD8+ cells regardless of the status of PD-L1 (Extended Data Figure 7g), 
although occasionally (two out of nine) patients whose tumours had low baseline CD8 
infiltrates responded to therapy. We integrated the data of CD8 and PD-L1 expression in 
biopsies with response and mutational load, allowing cases of DM and non-DM to self-
organize based on this data (Extended Data Figure 9a and b). CD8 and PD-L1 levels were 
not different between cases with pure or mixed DM histology (Extended Data Figure 9b). 
Biopsies with higher CD8+ invasive margin density clustered together usually with higher 
PD-L1 expression both intratumoral and in the invasive margin, and were enriched for 
patients with an objective tumour response. Mutational load, which was relatively high in all 
these cases, did not cluster with any particular pattern of CD8 or PD-L1 expression, or with 
response to therapy.

 Dense collagenous stroma as found in DM has been thought to be a major limitation for 
immune infiltration, as it has been described for pancreatic cancer.27 However, our data 
challenges this notion, as there are indeed pre-existing T cell infiltrates in the invasive edge 
of DM lesions, and a much higher response rate to anti-PD1 therapy than any other subtypes 
of melanoma. In fact, the response rate of 71% is among the highest to single agent PD-1 
blockade therapy in any pathologically-defined cancer, together with relapsed Hodgkin’s 
disease and Merkel cell carcinomas.21,28 Our data suggests that DM, and probably the non-
DM NF-1 subtype arising from sun-exposed areas, have a high response rate to PD-1 
blockade therapy due to having a more dynamic pre-existing adaptive immune response 
process.
Supplemental Methods
Analysis of clinical data
To conduct this retrospective analysis, records of 1058 patients with advanced melanoma 
treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy were reviewed across ten institutions to identify those 
with a diagnosis of DM. Each institution conducted its own search to find patients who fit 
these criteria. Study was conducted under Intuitional Review Board approval at each centre 
and complied with all relevant ethical regulations. All patients had signed a local written 
informed consent form for research analyses. Consent to obtain photographs was obtained.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses
Patients were selected for IHC analysis if they had adequate pre-treatment tumour samples 
and had signed a local written informed consent form for research analyses. Tumour samples 
were obtained from eight different institutions. Slides cut from frozen or FFPE tissue 
samples were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s Trichrome stain, or anti-S100, 
anti-CD8, and anti-PD-L1 at the UCLA Anatomic Pathology Immunohistochemistry and 
Histology Laboratory (CLIA-certified). Antibodies used included rabbit polyclonal S100 
(DAKO, 1/1000 dilution, low pH retrieval), CD8 clone C8/144B (Dako, 1/100, low pH 
retrieval), and PD-L1 (Sp142, 1/200 dilution with High pH retrieval Spring Biosciences, 
Pleasanton, CA). IHC was performed on Leica Bond III autostainer using Bond ancillary 
reagents and Refine Polymer Detection system. Slides were examined for the presence of 
CD8 and PD-L1 within the tumour parenchyma and the connective tissue surrounding the 
tumour (invasive margin). We defined the invasive margin (or leading edge) as the interfaces 
between individual tumour bundles and the fibrotic regions, as opposed to the intra-tumour 
staining, which is within the capsule of individual tumours. All slides were scanned at an 
absolute magnification of ×200 (resolution of 0.5 μm per pixel). An algorithm was designed 
based on pattern recognition that quantified immune cells within S100-positive areas 
(tumour) and S100-negative areas (invasive margin). The algorithm calculated the 
percentage cellularity (% positive cells/all nucleated cells) using the Halo platform (Indica 
Labs, Corrales, NM). This analysis system was not able to differentiate between tumour cell 
or infiltrating immune cell PD-L1 staining.29 Immunohistochemical variables were 
compared between biopsies of patients who responded or progressed using Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney test.

 Lymphocytic infiltrate and fibrosis analysis
We analyzed available pathological samples from 34 cases to define their lymphoid 
inflammation and degree of fibrosis. There is no quantitative measure for these readouts, so 
we used a semiquantitative pathological assessment. Examples of each grade were circulated 
to pathology reviewers to ensure reproducibility. When available, metastatic lesions were 
graded by the same schema as primary samples, as not all patients had primary tumor 
samples available for quantification. The hallmark of lymphoid infiltration in desmoplastic 
melanoma is the presence of lymphoid nodules within and occasionally surrounding the 
tumor. Therefore, we developed the grading schema below to describe the location of these 
nodules within the tumors as follows:
0
no lymphoid aggregates
1
lymphoid aggregates within tumor
2
lymphoid aggregates at tumor-stroma interface
3
lymphoid aggregates within tumor and at tumor-stroma interface
A grading schema was also developed to describe the degree of fibrosis in tumors:
0
no significant stroma separates tumor cells
1
mild increase in fibroblasts and/or myxoid stroma separates tumor cells
2
moderate increase in fibroblasts and/myxoid stroma separates tumor cells
3
tumor cells separated by abundant fibromyxoid stroma
Genetic analyses
In brief, whole exome sequencing was performed at the UCLA Clinical Microarray Core 
using the Roche Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v3.0 targeting 65 Mb of 
genome. Mutation calling was performed as previously described.14;17 Out of 22 biopsies of 
DM sequenced, 17 cases (3 complete responses, 8 partial responses, 1 stable disease, 5 
progressive disease) could be analysed by meeting quality control criteria for minimum 
coverage (50x tumour, 30x normal), tumour content (10%), and effective depth (12x 
purity*coverage, representing >80% probability to detect heterozygous mutations with at 
least 4 reads). These were compared with exome sequencing from the TCGA13, a prior DM 
cohort1, and two anti-PD-1 monotherapy treated cohorts, one from our group14 with 23 
cases which included a mix of responders and non-responders, and the second a subset of 30 
patients post-CTLA-4 non-response. From that cohort to include one sample per patient, we 
excluded on-treatment samples in the setting of response; then we selected the biopsy with 
the highest tumour purity, regardless of timepoint, since most patients with >1 biopsy had 
<10% variance in their mutational loads. Response was defined as CR, PR, or SD >12 
months by RECIST1.1 in both cohorts. Mutation calling methods between cohorts all used 
MuTect at their core, and only non-synonymous mutations (Nonsense, Missense, 
Splice_Site, Frameshift indels, In-frame indels, Start_Codon indels or SNPs, and Stoploss/
Nonstop variants) were assessed to minimize differences between exon-capture kits. An 
additional filter was applied to all data sets to exclude mutations at sites of known germline 
variation with an allele frequency >0.0005 in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)

 database v0.3.1. Tumour purity was estimated by Sequenza, or as 2 * median variant allele 
frequency if less than 30%. Loss-of-function burden was determined using the LOF SIgRank 
algorithm1, with the simulation run for 1000 iterations and synonymous mutations for 
background mutation rate defined as silent, 3′UTR, 5′UTR, or exon-flanking intronic 
mutations. Single nucleotide variants and their flanking contexts were analysed for mutation 
signatures for the DM and UCLA non-DM14 cohorts together using a published tool.9
Statistical analyses
Kaplan-Meier method and Greenwood’s formula were used for the estimation of survival 
probabilities (survival rates and overall survival) and the corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). Progression-free survival was defined from start of treatment to disease 
progression or death from any cause. Overall survival was defined from start of treatment to 
death from any cause. The objective response rate was reported as proportion along with 
Clopper-Pearson exact CIs. The chi-square and Fisher’s exact test were used to test for 
differences between groups for categorical variables. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank 
sum test was used to compare mutation rate between groups. Statistical analyses of the 
pathological data were performed using GraphPad Prism and mutation data using R v3.2.5. 
All tests were two-sided; P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

 Figure 1. High response rate to PD-1 blockade in patients with desmoplastic melanoma (DM)
A) Histological examples of three cases of DM compared with two cases of non-
desmoplastic cutaneous melanoma (non-DM) stained with Masson’s Trichrome stain to 
highlight the collagenous stroma characteristic of DM. Top panel: S100 stains (brown). 
Lower panel: Masson’s trichrome stain (blue collagenous stroma, red cytoplasm and brown 
nucleus). B) Images of three cases of DM with response to anti-PD-1/L1 therapy. Left: 
baseline images; right: images while on anti-PD-1 therapy. Of note, case #1 had already 
been depicted in reference30. C) Waterfall plot of best response on therapy of 56 patients 
with DM treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies (data was not available for 4 
patients, three who had progressive disease and one who had a partial response).

 Figure 2. High mutational load and similarity to NF1 subtype in desmoplastic melanoma (DM)
A) Top bar graph represents mutational load. Tiling plot shows mutations in a given gene 
(rows) per sample (columns). In the tiling plot, top line represents response, as either 
primary resistance/progressive disease (red), n=5, or response (partial or complete response 
and stable disease > 12 months, dark blue), n=12. Colour indicates mutation type, with 
truncating mutations (frameshift, nonsense, splice-site) in red, missense in green, and 
synonymous in beige. Darker colour intensity indicates potentially homozygous mutations, 
with variant allele frequency >1.5 times the sample median. * = biopsy from responding 
lesion despite a mixed response and eventual progression. o = patient showed no evidence of 
disease for > 1year after surgical resection of a progressing lesion. B) Non-synonymous 
mutations determined by whole exome sequencing (WES) from the current DM cohort, two 
pooled studies of anti-PD1 treated cutaneous melanoma14,15 and TCGA data. Each cohort is 
split by driver mutation subtype, colour indicates PD1 blockade therapy response (red = 
progression, blue = response), and shape represents desmoplastic pure vs mixed subtype. In

biopsies of patients with desmoplastic (DM) and non-desmoplastic cutaneous melanoma (non-
DM)
A) PD-L1 staining in the tumour centre (non-DM: 1CR/5PR/5PD; DM: 7CR/6PR/1SD/
3PD). B) CD8 staining in the tumour centre (non-DM: 2CR/5PR/6PD; DM: 7CR/7PR/1SD/
3PD). C) PD-L1 staining in the invasive margin (non-DM: 1CR/5PR/5PD; DM: 
6CR/6PR/1SD/3PD). D) CD8 staining in the invasive margin (non-DM: 2CR/5PR/6PD; 
DM: 6CR/7PR/1SD/3PD). Percentage of positively stained cells in all nucleated cells are 
presented. PD: progressive disease; SD: stable disease; CR: complete response; PR: partial 
response. * Indicates statistical significance. See supplementary table for all statistical 
analyses.
