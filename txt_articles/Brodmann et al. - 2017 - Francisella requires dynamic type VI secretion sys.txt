Francisella requires dynamic type VI secretion
system and ClpB to deliver effectors for
phagosomal escape
Maj Brodmann1,*, Roland F. Dreier1,*, Petr Broz1 & Marek Basler1
Francisella tularensis is an intracellular pathogen that causes the fatal zoonotic disease
tularaemia. Critical for its pathogenesis is the ability of the phagocytosed bacteria to escape
into the cell cytosol. For this, the bacteria use a non-canonical type VI secretion system
(T6SS) encoded on the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI). Here we show that in F. novicida
T6SS assembly initiates at the bacterial poles both in vitro and within infected macrophages.
T6SS dynamics and function depends on the general purpose ClpB unfoldase, which
specifically colocalizes with contracted sheaths and is required for their disassembly. T6SS
assembly depends on iglF, iglG, iglI and iglJ, whereas pdpC, pdpD, pdpE and anmK are
dispensable. Importantly, strains lacking pdpC and pdpD are unable to escape from
phagosome, activate AIM2 inflammasome or cause disease in mice. This suggests that PdpC
and PdpD are T6SS effectors involved in phagosome rupture.

 F
rancisella tularensis is a Gram-negative bacterium that
causes the zoonotic disease tularaemia in human and animal
host. The severity of tularaemia varies depending on the
route of infection and the type of strain. The Francisella tularensis
subsp. tularensis
is the most virulent
strain and
aerosol
transmission of a few bacteria can cause lethal pneumonia in
humans1. Given the low infectious dose and the severity of the
infection, subsp. tularensis has been classified as Tier 1 select
agent. The related strain Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida
(F. novicida) has in contrast low virulence in humans, but is
highly virulent in mice and thus often used as a laboratory model
for tularaemia2. The pathogenicity of both Francisella species is
linked to their ability to replicate in the cytosol of phagocytes,
such as macrophages or dendritic cells. After phagocytosis, the
bacteria shortly reside within a membrane-bound phagosome, but
subsequently disrupt the phagosomal membrane and escape into
the host cell cytosol, where they replicate3.
While phagosomal escape is essential for Francisella intracel-
lular replication and virulence in vivo, it also allows the host to
mount anti-microbial and innate immune defenses. Among these
are the production of type I interferons (type I IFNs) via
the cGAS-STING-IRF3 axis, the production of antimicrobial
guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) and the activation of the
AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasome, which controls
the release of mature IL-1b and IL-18 as well as the induction
of host cell death through pyroptosis4–11. Interferon production
and inflammasome activation require the recognition of bacterial
DNA in the cytosol, and have been linked to the lysis of cytosolic
Francisella. Mice deficient in these responses fail to control
bacterial replication, resulting in a fatal disease4–6,8,9. Francisella
virulence and the escape from the phagosomal compartment
requires a gene cluster referred to as the Francisella Pathogenicity
Island (FPI)12. Two nearly identical copies of the FPI are found
in
subspecies
tularensis,
holarctica
and
mediasiatica.
The
F. novicida genome contains only a single FPI copy13, but
features a related island called ‘Francisella novicida Island
(FNI)’14,15. The FPI has been suggested to encode a non-
canonical type VI secretion system (T6SS)16,17, which based on
gene content and phylogeny is proposed to represent a unique
T6SS subtype (T6SSii)18.
T6SS is a nanomachine capable of delivery of effector proteins
across target cell membranes of both bacterial and eukaryotic cells
and thus is often required for bacterial competition and
pathogenesis19–23. One of the hallmarks of this system is its
highly dynamic assembly that can be visualized by live-cell
fluorescence
microscopy24,25.
Assembly
of
T6SS
starts
by
formation of a membrane complex formed of TssJ, TssL and
TssM26. This is followed by assembly of a baseplate complex from
TssE, TssF, TssG, TssK and also VgrG, PAAR spike as well as
TssA in some organisms27–31. Baseplate complex then initiates
assembly of a long Hcp tube and TssB, TssC (or VipA, VipB)
sheath wrapped around the tube32. Both spike and Hcp tube can
associate with effectors and are delivered together into target cells
upon rapid sheath contraction33–39.
Even though the F. novicida sheath is structurally similar to the
sheath of canonical T6SS of V. cholerae40,41, it is unclear to what
extent the canonical T6SS assembly mechanisms apply to
Francisella. The reason is that Francisella T6SS is highly
divergent and clear homologues of several core components are
missing, such as TssE, TssF and TssG. In addition, many
components such as TssK, VgrG, Hcp and PAAR have only low
primary sequence homology to the canonical T6SS components.
For example, IglG was recently shown to be structurally similar to
PAAR proteins, which are required for T6SS function15,29. On the
other hand, the FPI cluster contains many genes of unknown
function, such as iglF, iglI, iglJ, pdpA, pdpC, pdpE, pdpD
and
anmK.

and

for
phagosomal escape, intracellular growth and virulence42–48.
Interestingly, the FPI cluster lacks a homologue of an unfoldase
ClpV, which is present in all canonical T6SS clusters and
recycles contracted sheaths14,24,49,50. Overall, the non-canonical
gene composition suggests a unique mode of action of the
Francisella T6SS.
Here we show that F. novicida T6SS sheath cycles between
assembly, contraction and disassembly. Interestingly, the vast
majority of T6SS sheath assemblies initiate close or at the cell
pole. We show that ClpB colocalizes with contracted sheaths and
is required for sheath disassembly, however, is dispensable for

 sheath assembly and contraction. T6SS dynamics and function
depends on iglF, iglG, iglI and iglJ, while pdpC and pdpD are
specifically required for phagosomal escape and virulence in a
mouse model of tularaemia, but also for the engagement of the
host innate immune response.
Results
Francisella T6SS is dynamic and assembles on the cell pole.
Francisella T6SS has a non-canonical gene composition and lacks
ClpV suggesting unique mode of action (Fig. 1). To understand
Francisella T6SS assembly and function, we searched for
conditions that would allow us to image subcellular localization
of TssB homologue IglA. We have serendipitously discovered
that F. novicida iglA-sfGFP grown to an exponential phase in
BHI media induced expression of IglA-sfGFP upon prolonged
incubation
on
an
agarose
pad
under
a
glass
coverslip.
Importantly, the increase in expression correlated with an
increase in number of IglA-sfGFP structures detected in the
bacteria (Fig. 2a,b). Time-lapse imaging at a rate of 20 frames per
minute showed that IglA-sfGFP structures extended across the
bacteria within 30 and 120 s with assembly speeds between 5 and
15 nm s � 1.
After
full assembly,
the IglA-sfGFP
structures
immediately contracted to approximately half of their original
length and became brighter (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 1a;
Supplementary Movies 1 and 4). After contraction, the sheath
structures were disassembled during the next B2–3 min (Fig. 2c;
Supplementary Fig. 1a). The average fluorescence intensity of the
bacteria before and after one cycle of assembly, contraction and
disassembly was similar, suggesting that IglA-sfGFP remained
stable and folded during this cycle (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
Importantly, no IglA-sfGFP structures were detected in the
bacteria lacking the TssM homologue encoded by pdpB (Fig. 1),
suggesting that assembly of IglA-sfGFP structures is dependent

 on the function of the whole T6SS (Fig. 2d; Supplementary
Movie 2). The dynamics of IglA-sfGFP localization is similar to
that of VipA-sfGFP in V. cholerae and is consistent with the fact
that IglA and IglB form a structure closely resembling V. cholerae
T6SS sheath25,40,41.
Interestingly, we also noticed that IglA-sfGFP sheaths were
preferentially assembled from the bacterial pole and thus often
formed structures as long as the bacterial length. To quantify the
preference for subcellular localization, we divided the bacterial
perimeter equally to a polar region and a mid-cell region (Fig. 2e)
and counted assemblies initiated in these two equally large
regions. Out of 851 assemblies, 821 assemblies (96.5%) were
initiated in the polar region. As a control, we performed the same
analysis for V. cholerae and show that only 53.8% (425 from 790)
assemblies were initiated in the polar region (Fig. 2f) as expected
for
assemblies
without
preferred
localization24,25,51.
Taken
together, we show that F. novicida assembles a dynamic T6SS
sheath on the cell poles and that the sheath cycles through
assembly, contraction and disassembly similarly to what was
previously described for other canonical T6SSs.
ClpB is required for disassembly of contracted sheaths. The fact
that contracted sheaths were quickly disassembled without
apparent degradation of IglA-sfGFP suggested that F. novicida
recycles contracted sheaths using a mechanism similar to the
canonical
ClpV-mediated
sheath
disassembly.
The
closest
homologue of V. cholerae ClpV in F. novicida genome is ClpB
(FTN_1743) (36% sequence identity). Interestingly, clpB was
previously shown to be required for survival of various stresses52
but also essential for intracellular replication and virulence of
F. novicida53,54.
Here we show that F. novicida lacking clpB mainly contained
bright IglA-sfGFP foci (Fig. 3a). Time-lapse imaging showed
that the F. novicida DclpB occasionally assembled new sheaths
with kinetics similar to that of the parental strain but after
contraction, the sheaths were never disassembled and remained
intact in the bacteria (Fig. 3a,b; Supplementary Movies 1 and 4).
Such assembly was still dependent on functional T6SS, as no
sheath extensions and contractions were detected in F. novicida
DclpB/pdpB. However, some bright, non-dynamic IglA-sfGFP
foci were detected in the absence of both clpB and pdpB
(Supplementary Fig. 2a; Supplementary Movie 2). This indicates
that activity of ClpB is required for recycling of contracted
sheaths, however, in case of a defect in ClpB function, some
non-dynamic IglA-sfGFP foci may form also in the absence of a
fully functional T6SS.
To test directly the role of ClpB in disassembly of the
contracted sheaths, we introduced clpB-mCherry2 fusion to the
native locus on the chromosome of the iglA-sfGFP or wild-type
strain. Fusing mCherry2 to ClpB had no influence on the ability
of F. novicida to survive heat shock indicating that such fusion is
fully
functional
(Supplementary
Fig.
2d).
ClpB-mCherry2
subcellular localization cycled between uniform cytosolic and
punctate localization and this dynamics was dependent on
the presence of pdpB (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c, Supplementary
Movie 3). When IglA-sfGFP and ClpB-mCherry2 were imaged
simultaneously, ClpB spots colocalized specifically with the
contracted sheaths (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Movies 3 and 5).
F. novicida uses the T6SS to escape from phagosome of cells
like macrophages and consistently IglA-sfGFP spots could be
detected in intracellular bacteria, implying the assembly of T6SS
sheaths40. To test whether sheath assembly is dynamic under
physiological conditions during infection, we infected primary
murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from
wild-type C57BL/6 mice for 1 h with exponentially grown
F. novicida. After washing away non-phagocytosed bacteria, the
infected cells were fixed, stained with phalloidin and anti-F.

and

sheaths
(Fig. 4a,b). This analysis confirmed that F. novicida reside
inside the macrophage and assemble T6SS sheaths.
Next, we imaged IglA-sfGFP and ClpB-mCherry2 dynamics
within F. novicida in live macrophages and observed that the
sheaths cycled through assembly, contraction and disassembly.
Importantly, ClpB-mCherry2 dynamically localized into spots
that colocalized with the contracted sheaths, suggesting that
ClpB is responsible for disassembly of the contracted sheaths
also within phagosomes of infected macrophages (Fig. 4c;
Supplementary Movie 6). In total, we analysed 30 sheath
assembly, contraction and disassembly events inside live macro-
phages and all of the assemblies originated from the cell pole
(Fig. 4c; Supplementary Movie 6). Together, these data suggest
that sheath dynamics and subcellular localization observed
during imaging of F. novicida on agarose pads is similar to that
of the sheath in the bacteria residing inside of live macrophages.
To determine the importance of ClpB for F. novicida pathogen-
esis, we infected BMDMs with F. novicida wild-type, DpdpB and
DclpB and determined the percentage of phagosomal and cytosolic
bacteria using a phagosome-protection assay based on selective
permeabilization
of
the
plasma
membrane
with
digitonin9.
F. novicida DclpB had a significant defect in phagosomal escape
at 4 h post infection, similarly to bacteria lacking the essential
structural component PdpB (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 3a).
Consistent with reduced cytosolic localization, we observed
significantly reduced levels of pyroptosis induction and cytokine
release in LPS-primed BMDMs infected for 10 h with F. novicida
DpdpB and DclpB, while the wild-type strain elicited strong
immune responses (Fig. 3e). Finally, we evaluated the role of ClpB
in vivo in a mouse model of tularaemia. We infected age- and sex-
matched wild-type C57BL/6 mice subcutaneously with 104 colony-
forming units (CFUs) of F. novicida wild-type, DpdpB and DclpB
and measured the bacterial burden at 2 days post infection. Mice
infected with F. novicida DclpB displayed significantly reduced
bacterial counts in the liver and spleen as compared to the mice
infected with F. novicida wild type, and in many cases no bacteria
could be recovered, similarly to what was observed with F. novicida
DpdpB (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Overall these results indicate that
ClpB acts as an unfoldase for the FPI-encoded T6SS sheath, and
that its activity is essential for T6SS dynamics and consequently
F. novicida virulence.
Differential requirement of FPI genes for sheath dynamics.
Almost all FPI genes were shown to be required for intracellular
replication probably due to a lack of phagosomal escape, however,
many genes of the FPI cluster have no known homologues or
were not characterized in detail14. Importantly, both structural
components of T6SS as well as putative effectors secreted by T6SS
are in principle essential for overall T6SS function, however,
effectors may be to a certain degree dispensable for T6SS
assembly. To provide an insight into which FPI genes are
required for assembly of T6SS and which may potentially encode
secreted effectors, we generated in-frame deletions of genes
for which we were unable to predict function based on homology
to known canonical T6SS components (Fig. 1). IglA-sfGFP
subcellular localization was then imaged in those strains under
the same conditions as used before for the parental strain.
In DiglF and DiglG strains, we detected on average 1 dynamic
sheath assembly per 400 and 500 cells, respectively, in 5 min
(Supplementary Movie 2). This suggests that IglF and IglG may

 be required for efficient initiation of T6SS assembly. On the other
hand, iglI and iglJ are essential for sheath assembly as no sheath
assemblies were detected in more than 1,000 cells in 5 min even
though IglA-sfGFP was expressed to the same level as in the
parental strain (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Movie 2). Consistent with
the defect in T6SS assembly, we found that DiglF, DiglG, DiglI and
DiglJ strains were unable to escape into the cytosol of the infected
macrophages, and consequently failed to activate cytosolic innate
immune signalling (Fig. 5b,c). We cannot completely rule out the
possibility that the observed phenotypes of mutants are due to
polar effects on expression of other T6SS genes. However, defect
in intracellular growth was previously successfully complemented
for iglF, iglG and iglI genes55.
Single deletion of pdpE, pdpC, pdpD and anmK or deletion of
both pdpD and anmK (DpdpD/anmK) or pdpC and pdpD (DpdpC/
pdpD) had no significant influence on sheath dynamics or
localization (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Movie 1). Only deletion of
all three genes pdpC, pdpD and anmK in the same strain decreased
frequency of sheath assembly by 30% from an average of one
structure
per
three
cells to about
one structure per
five
cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Nevertheless, sheath assemblies in
DpdpC/pdpD/anmK still preferentially localized to the cell pole,
assembled with a similar speed and cycled through extension,
contraction
and
disassembly
like
in
the
parental
strain
(Supplementary Fig. 4b,c; Supplementary Movie 1). Importantly,
DpdpE and DpdpC/pdpD/anmK assembled sheaths with dynamics
undistinguishable from the parental strain within infected macro-
phages (Supplementary Fig. 5e,f). In conclusion, our analysis
allowed us to identify FPI genes (iglF, iglG, iglI and iglJ) essential for
T6SS assembly and a distinct set of FPI genes (pdpE, pdpC, pdpD
and anmK) that are dispensable for T6SS assembly.
PdpC and PdpD are required for phagosomal escape. To test
whether pdpE, pdpC, pdpD and anmK genes are required for the
escape of F. novicida from phagosome, we infected BMDMs with

 F. novicida DpdpE, DanmK, DpdpC, DpdpD, DpdpD/anmK or
DpdpC/pdpD/anmK and determined the percentage of phagoso-
mal and cytosolic bacteria compared to wild-type and DpdpB
bacteria as outlined above (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Interestingly,
we found that deletion of pdpC resulted in a very strong defect in
phagosomal escape in comparison to wild-type bacteria, although
the reduction was smaller than with bacteria lacking the
structural component PdpB (Fig. 6b). F. novicida DpdpD and
DpdpD/anmK also showed a defect in phagosomal escape, which
was however less severe than the phenotype of a pdpC or pdpB
deletion. No significant difference in phagosomal escape was
observed between DpdpD and DpdpD/anmK strains, indicating
that AnmK plays no role in phagosomal escape, consistent
with the finding that phagosomal escape of the DanmK strain
was indistinguishable from the wild-type strain (Fig. 6b). To
determine whether the effect of a pdpC and pdpD deletion was
additive, we generated a strain lacking pdpC, pdpD and also
anmK. Interestingly, bacteria lacking pdpC/pdpD/anmK were
unable to escape from the phagosomal compartment similarly to
the DpdpB strain. In contrast, deletion of pdpE had no significant
effect on phagosomal escape (Fig. 6b).
Next, we tested the role of pdpE, pdpC, pdpD and anmK in
cytosolic innate immune detection of F. novicida. Consistent
with the reduced level of cytosolic localization, we found that
F. novicida DpdpC and DpdpC/pdpD/anmK induced significantly
lower levels of type I IFN production in unprimed BMDMs
infected for 10 h at an MOI of 100 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). The
triple mutant DpdpC/pdpD/anmK had the most severe phenotype
and only elicited IFN levels in the range of the DpdpB strain
(Supplementary Fig. 5c).
Since type I IFNs control the activation of the AIM2
inflammasome during F. novicida infection5, we examined the
level
of
inflammasome
activation
in
LPS-primed
infected
macrophages at different time points (Fig. 6c; Supplementary
Fig. 5a). While infection with F. novicida lacking pdpC or pdpD
resulted in significantly reduced levels of inflammasome activation,
only the deletion of both pdpC and pdpD completely abrogated cell
death induction and cytokine production in infected macrophages,
which was consistent with the reduced levels of cytosolic
localization and type I IFN induction in macrophages infected
with mutants lacking both proteins (Fig. 6b; Supplementary
Fig. 5c). Cell death induction and cytokine production in infected
macrophages was unchanged between cells infected with wild-type
and DanmK bacteria indicating that AnmK is not involved in
modulating inflammasome activation (Fig. 6c). Consistently, cell
death and cytokine production was comparable between cells
infected with F. novicida DpdpC/pdpD and DpdpC/pdpD/anmK or
F. novicida DpdpD and DpdpD/anmK. Importantly, the observed

were

of

or

F.
novicida
responded
similarly
(Supplementary Fig. 5b). Deletion of pdpE had no significant
effect on the level of type I IFN induction, pyroptosis and cytokine
release (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c).
Previous work has implicated the FPI in intracellular replication55,
therefore, we also examined intracellular replication of wild-type
or mutant F. novicida. We monitored growth over 24h of infection
in BMDMs lacking the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC as they
fail to trigger pyroptosis in response to bacterial infection8.
F. novicida wild-type and DpdpE replicated over the course of the
infection (Supplementary Fig. 5d), while bacteria that lacked
a dynamic T6SS (DpdpB or DclpB) or bacteria that had a dynamic
T6SS, but were deficient in phagosomal escape (DpdpC or
DpdpC/pdpD/anmK), were cleared over the course of the infection.
Consistent with reduced phagosomal escape, pdpD/anmK-deficient
bacteria also displayed a reduced rate of replication compared to
wild-type bacteria, however, the difference was not significant.
Finally, we examined the role of potential T6SS effectors
in vivo. Age- and sex-matched wild-type C57BL/6 mice were
infected subcutaneously with 104 CFUs of F. novicida wild-type
or strains deficient for the putative effectors, and the bacterial
burden in the liver and spleen as well as serum IL-18 levels were
assessed at 2 days post infection (Fig. 6d,e). The bacterial burden
closely correlated with phagosomal escape, in that a partial
reduction in virulence could be observed in DpdpC and
DpdpD/anmK-infected mice. Deletion of pdpC alone had a
stronger effect than deletion of pdpD/anmK although this
difference was only significant in the liver. Deleting all three
potential effectors, DpdpC/pdpD/anmK, rendered the bacteria
largely avirulent, similarly to the deletion of the T6SS structural
component
pdpB.
Consistent
with
the
reduced
levels
of
inflammasome activation
in vitro
(Fig.
6c; Supplementary
Fig. 5a), we found that deletion of pdpB, pdpC, pdpD/anmK or
pdpC/pdpD/anmK resulted in significantly lower levels of serum
IL-18. A deficiency in pdpE appeared to have no effect on
virulence or host response, since infection with F. novicida DpdpE
resulted in bacterial burden and cytokine levels that were
comparable to infections with F. novicida wild type (Fig. 6d,e).
In summary, these results confirm previous studies indicating
that PdpC and PdpD are T6SS-secreted effectors. Moreover, we
show that PdpC and PdpD are dispensable for T6SS dynamics
and specifically facilitate the escape of F. novicida from the
phagosome into the host cell cytosol and therefore are essential
for Francisella virulence.
Discussion
We show here that Francisella T6SS sheath is under certain
conditions highly dynamic and ClpB is necessary for sheath
disassembly. Since ClpB-mCherry2 specifically colocalizes with

 the contracted sheaths, our data suggest that ClpB is directly
involved in Francisella sheath disassembly similarly to ClpV in
canonical T6SS (refs 24,49,50,56,57). Interestingly, Francisella
ClpB was also shown to alter the immune response in vivo58 and
to be required for heat shock survival52. However, we show here
that T6SS activity is dispensable for heat shock survival
(Supplementary Fig. 2d). This suggests that, in contrast to
canonical T6SS where ClpV is apparently solely dedicated to
sheath disassembly, Francisella ClpB has a dual role. This raises
the question how ClpB recognizes different substrates and
whether a specific adaptor protein is required to recognize
contracted sheaths similarly to adaptor proteins that recognize
substrates for AAA þ -mediated unfolding59–62. We show that
ClpB is important for F. novicida virulence, which is consistent
with what was shown previously52–54,58. Since all virulence
related phenotypes of clpB-negative strain correlated with the
phenotypes of the other strains with impaired T6SS dynamics
(Fig. 3; Supplementary Figs 2 and 3), we propose that in vivo
ClpB is mainly important for T6SS sheath disassembly. However,
refolding of substrates unrelated to T6SS may be required to

 survive certain stresses, which Francisella encounter during
pathogenesis.
Detailed analysis of subcellular localization of dynamic T6SS
sheath shows that Francisella T6SS assembles on the bacterial cell
poles both in vitro as well as during infection of macrophages
(Figs 2e,f and 3c; Supplementary Fig. 5e,f). Interestingly, similarly
to what we show here for Francisella, ClpV-5 from T6SS-5 of
Burkholderia thailandensis was found to preferentially localize to
spots on bacterial poles63. Those spots were however less dynamic
than ClpB spots in Francisella and thus it remains to be directly
tested if assembly of T6SS-5 of B. thailandensis indeed initiates at
the poles. Interestingly, both T6SS-5 of B. thailandensis and
Francisella T6SS are required for manipulation of the eukaryotic
cells after bacterial internalization. However, unlike in Francisella,
T6SS-5 of B. thailandensis is only required for formation of
multinucleated giant cells after bacteria escape from endosomes
using T3SS63–67. Since T6SS sheaths almost always assemble as
long as the bacteria, one possible advantage of the polar
localization could be that the sheaths assembled from the pole
in rod shaped bacteria would be generally longer than the sheaths
assembled from the side of the cells. Given that the T6SS sheaths
only contract to about half of their extended size25, longer sheaths
may increase the distance to which T6SS can deliver effectors.
Interestingly, restricted subcellular localization was shown to
decrease T6SS efficiency in inter-bacterial competitions despite
increased overall activity51. However, since F. novicida is
completely surrounded by phagosome membrane, restricted
directionality of T6SS assembly should have no consequences
for delivery of effectors to the host cell. In addition, polar
localization of T6SS may increase chances of puncturing
phagosomal membranes, as those may be physically closer to
the bacterial poles when bacteria are in a tight membrane
compartment. As it was shown previously for inter-bacterial
interactions, proper aiming of the T6SS apparatus at the target
bacteria increases efficiency of substrate translocation37,51.
The primary function of the Francisella T6SS is to promote the
escape of Francisella from the phagosome. We show that
phagosome escape depends entirely on PdpC and PdpD, which
are dispensable for T6SS assembly and dynamics (Fig. 6a,b;
Supplementary Movie 1), suggesting that these proteins function
as effectors necessary for phagosomal escape. It is also possible
that PdpD and PdpC are required for activity or secretion
of yet uncharacterized T6SS effectors to promote phagosomal
escape, however previous work by Eshraghi et al.42 has shown
that F. novicida PdpC and PdpD are released by the T6SS in an
in vitro secretion assay, supporting the hypothesis that these
proteins function as secreted effectors in the target cell. Moreover,
F. tularensis and F. holarctica lacking pdpC are unable to escape
from
the
phagosome,
induce
cytotoxicity
and
replicate
intracellularly, and they are avirulent in a mouse model of
tularaemia43,44,46–48. These observations support our conclusions
that PdpC contribute to Francisella virulence, independent of the
Francisella tularensis subspecies. Whereas pdpC is conserved in all
subspecies
of
Francisella
tularensis,
pdpD
is
differentially
encoded45. Therefore, PdpD might have subspecies-specific
virulence related functions.
PdpC and PdpD share no homology with known effectors or
pore forming toxins, such as Listeriolysin O, type C phospho-
lipases or phenol-soluble modulins, that allow other cytosolic
bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, Burkholderia
thailandensis or Staphylococcus aureus) to escape from the
phagosome, and thus might represent a novel class of effectors
with membranolytic function68,69. The exact mechanism of how
these effectors destabilize the phagosomal membrane and if
this results in the recruitment of galectin-8, a marker of ruptured
vacuoles that recruits antimicrobial autophagy70, remains to be
analysed. The Francisella O-antigen allows the bacteria to avoid
ubiquitination and uptake into LC3-positive compartments71,
but whether Francisella can actively inhibit or escape autophagy
by injected effectors, as reported for Listeria and Shigella
is unknown72.
PdpE and AnmK, which are dispensable for T6SS assembly and
phagosomal escape (Fig. 6a,b), might be effectors whose function
is required once the bacteria enter the cytosol. However,
their contribution to overall bacterial replication and virulence
in vivo is minor (Fig. 6d,e; Supplementary Fig. 5d). In addition,
OpiA and OpiB, encoded outside of the FPI cluster, were recently
identified as T6SS secreted proteins, however, their contribution
to intracellular replication is also minimal in comparison to
the effects of a pdpC or pdpD deletion42. It is possible that
these effectors have tissue-specific functions, or that they are
required
for
Francisella
replication
in
amoeba
or
within
arthropod hosts73,74.
Live-cell imaging of T6SS sheath dynamics suggests that IglF,
IglG, IglI and IglJ are putative structural components required for
T6SS assembly in Francisella (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Movie 2).
These proteins could be homologues of components of canonical
T6SS baseplate, which are difficult to identify using homology
modelling14,75 (Fig. 1). However, it is also conceivable that some
of these proteins may be secreted effectors or be required for
effector secretion, because deletion of certain effectors decreases
T6SS function in V. cholerae37,76. Nonetheless, our finding that
the dynamics of Francisella T6SS is possible to image in vitro will
help to dissect the assembly of this non-canonical T6SS and to
differentiate between structural components and translocated
substrates. Further analysis of the structural components will
reveal principles of T6SS evolution and defining the molecular
mechanisms by which Francisella effectors modulate host cell
signalling will significantly contribute to our understanding of
Francisella virulence.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions. Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida
strain U112 (hereafter F. novicida) and the derivative strains were grown at
37 �C with aeration in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium supplemented with
0.2% L-cysteine (Sigma) and appropriate antibiotics. Antibiotic concentrations
used were 100 mg ml � 1 ampicillin (AppliChem) or 15 mg ml � 1 kanamycin
(AppliChem). A detailed strain list can be found in Supplementary Table 1. For
infection with F. novicida, BHI medium was inoculated with bacteria from BHI
agar plate (supplemented with 0.2% L-cysteine (Sigma) and appropriate antibiotics)
and were grown overnight at 37 �C with aeration.
Bacterial mutagenesis. All in-frame deletions were generated by homologous
recombination using the suicide vector pDMK3 as previously described77. A list of
plasmids, primers as well as remaining peptides encoded by deleted genes can be
found in Supplementary Table 2. To obtain single colonies after recombination,
bacteria were grown overnight at 37 �C on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA)
supplemented with 0.1% D-glucose (Millipore), 0.1% FCS (BioConcept),
100 mg ml � 1 ampicillin (AppliChem) and 0.1% L-cysteine (Sigma) (hereafter MHA
plate). Cloning product sequences were verified and chromosomal mutations were
tested by PCR using primers located outside of the replaced region. Sites of
homologous recombination of the chromosomal mutations were verified by
sequencing.
Heat shock survival assay. Heat shock survival assay was adapted from ref. 52.
In brief, bacteria were grown overnight as described above, diluted 1:40 in BHI
medium and grown for 3 h at 37 �C with aeration. Then bacteria were diluted
1:10 in 250 ml BHI in a 1.5 ml tube and incubated in a water bath at 50 �C for
0, 15 or 30 min. At each time point the bacteria were transferred on ice and serial
dilutions were plated on MHA plates. The next day, CFUs were counted and the
concentration of surviving bacteria was calculated.
Fluorescence microscopy. Procedures and settings to detect a fluorescence signal
in F. novicida were employed as previously described37,41. All imaging was carried
out at 37 �C and humidity was regulated to 95% using a T-unit (Oko-lab). The
exposure time was set to 150 ms for all channels. For bacterial imaging on agarose
pads, F. novicida strains from BHI plate were washed once with BHI, diluted

 1:40 in BHI medium and grown at 37 �C with aeration for 3–4 h. Bacteria from
1 ml culture were re-suspended in 50–100 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
spotted on a pad of 1% agarose in PBS, covered with a cover glass (Roth) and either
imaged directly or incubated at 37 �C for 1 h before imaging. Images were collected
every 3 s for T6SS assembly speed quantification and every 30 s for assessment of
T6SS dynamics. For imaging of infected macrophages, BMDMs were seeded onto
cover glass (VWR) in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 � 105 cells per well and
infected with F. novicida at a multiplicity of infection of 100 in 1 ml OptiMEM
(Life Technologies) as described below. Thirty minutes post infection, the BMDMs
were washed three times with OptiMEM and the cover glass was mounted on a pad
of 1% agarose in PBS BMDMs facing down. Images were collected every 30 s for
assessment of T6SS dynamics.
Image analysis. Fiji78 was used for all image analysis and manipulations as
described previously37,51. The ‘Time Series Analyzer V3.0’ plugin was used for
quantification of GFP signal intensity. For comparison of GFP signal intensities of
mutants and wild type, only bacteria without assembled T6SS structures were
considered. For quantification of T6SS activity in different mutants from 5 min
time-lapse movies the ‘temporal colour code’ function was used. For kymograms
and T6SS assembly speed quantification the ‘reslice’ function was used. For
determination of subcellular localization of T6SS assembly the surface area of
bacteria was divided into an equally sized polar and mid cell area. The surface area
was calculated based on the model of a capsule using the manually measured length
and width of the bacteria (see formulas below). T6SS assemblies initiating in one of
the two pole areas were considered as T6SS assemblies at pole.

For determination of subcellular localization of T6SS assembly, images of
V. cholerae 2740-80 were reanalysed from ref. 37. Contrast on compared sets of
images was adjusted equally. All imaging experiments were performed with at least
two biological replicates.
Structured illumination microscopy. BMDMs were seeded onto cover glass
(VWR) in 24-well plates at a density of 1.25 � 105 cells per well and infected with
F. novicida at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 1 h as described below. BMDMs
were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 10 min at 37 �C with 4%
paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Science). Cover glass was incubated with
chicken anti-F. novicida (1:2,000; a gift from D.M. Monack, Stanford University)
for 1 h at room temperature, then was washed three times with PBS, incubated with
goat anti-chicken coupled to Alexa 568 (1:500; Life Technologies) and
DY-647-Phalloidin (1:500; Dyomics) for another 45 min at room temperature,
washed three times with PBS and was mounted on glass slides with Vectashield
(Vector labs). 3D-SM was performed on a microscope system DeltaVision
OMX-Blaze version 4 (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Images were acquired
using a Plan Apo N 60 � 1.42 numerical aperture oil immersion objective lens
(Olympus) and four liquid-cooled sCMOS cameras (pco Edge, full frame
2,560 � 2,160; Photometrics). Optical z-sections were separated by 0.125 mm. The
laser lines 488 and 568 were used for 3D-SIM acquisition. Exposure times were
typically between 10 and 140 ms, and the power of each laser was adjusted to
achieve optimal intensities of between 5,000 and 8,000 counts in a raw image of
15-bit dynamic range at the lowest laser power possible to minimize
photobleaching. Phalloidin Alexa-647 was acquired using the widefield mode
of the system. Raw 3D-SIM images were processed and reconstructed using the
DeltaVision OMX SoftWoRx software package (Applied Precision).
Cell culture and infection. Primary wild-type BMDMs from C57BL/6JRj mice
(Janvier) were differentiated in DMEM (Sigma) with 20% M-CSF (supernatants of
L929 mouse fibroblasts), 10% v/v FCS, 10 mM HEPES, nonessential amino acids
and penicillin (100 IU ml � 1)/streptomycin (100 mg ml � 1) (all BioConcept). One
day before infection, BMDMs were seeded into 24- or 96-well plates (Eppendorf) at
a density of 1.5 � 105 or 5 � 104 cells per well in DMEM (Sigma) with 10% M-CSF
(supernatants of L929 mouse fibroblasts), 10% v/v FCS, 10 mM HEPES and
nonessential amino acids (all BioConcept). Where required, BMDMs were
pre-stimulated overnight with LPS (from Escherichia coli strain O111:B4
(InvivoGen; tlr-3pelps)). F. novicida were grown overnight at 37 �C with aeration
as described above. The bacteria were added to the BMDMs at a multiplicity of
infection of 100 or the indicated value. The plates were centrifuged for 5 min at
500g to ensure similar adhesion of the bacteria to the cells and were incubated for
120 min at 37 �C. Next, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing
10 mg ml � 1 gentamicin (BioConcept) to kill extracellular bacteria, then plates were
incubated at 37 �C for the indicated length of time.
Cytokine and LDH release measurement. IL-1b and IL-18 were measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (eBioscience). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
was measured with an LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Takara). To correct for
spontaneous cell lysis and to normalize the values, the percentage of LDH release
was calculated as follows:
LDH valueinfected � LDH valueuninfected
LDH valuetotal lysis � LDH valueuninfected
�100
Phagosome protection assay. The amount of cytoplasmic and vacuolar bacteria
was measured as previously described79. In brief, BMDMs were seeded into 24-well
plates at a density of 1.5 � 105 cells per well and F. novicida were grown for 4 h at
37 �C with aeration as described above. BMDMs were infected with F. novicida at a
multiplicity of infection of 100 for 4 h as outlined above. BMDMs were washed
three times with KHM buffer (110 mM potassium acetate, 20 mM Hepes, 2 mM
MgCl2) and incubated for 1 min with 75 mg ml � 1 digitonin (Sigma) followed by
differential staining of cytoplasmic and total bacteria. Antibodies used for staining
were chicken anti-F. novicida (1:2,000; a gift from D.M. Monack, Stanford
University) and goat anti-chicken coupled to Alexa 647 (cytoplasmic bacteria) or
Alexa 488 (total bacteria) (1:500; both from Life Technologies). Stained bacteria
were analysed on a FACS-Canto-II. Percentage of cytosolic bacteria were
normalized to wild-type F. novicida as follows:
FACS value � FACS valueDpdpB

Intracellular bacterial growth assay. BMDMs were seeded into 24-well plates at
a density of 1.5 � 105 cells per well and infected with F. novicida at a multiplicity of
infection of 1 as described above. After 2 and 24 h of infection, the BMDMs were
washed three times with PBS and lysed with 0.1% Triton-X 100 (Promega) for
10 min at 37 �C. The bacteria were stained for 10 min with chicken anti-F. novicida
(1:2,000; a gift from D.M. Monack, Stanford University), washed once with PBS
and stained for 10 min with goat anti-chicken coupled to Alexa 647 and Alexa 488

(eBioscience) was added to each sample. The samples were analysed on a
FACS-Canto-II by counting the number of bacteria per 5,000 beads. The CFU ratio
was calculated by dividing the number of bacteria at 24 h (output) with the number
of bacteria at 2 h (input).
Type I interferon measurement. One day before infection, ISRE-L929 reporter
cells (a gift from D.M. Monack, Stanford University) were seeded into black 96-well
plates with micro-clear bottom (Greiner) at a density of 1 � 105 cells per well in
DMEM (Sigma) with 10% v/v FCS and penicillin (100 IU ml � 1)/streptomycin
(100 mg ml � 1) (both BioConcept). BMDMs were seeded into 96-well plates at a
density of 5 � 104 cells per well and infected with F. novicida at a multiplicity of
infection of 100 as described above. After 10 h of infection, type I IFN production
was measured with the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) as
previously described80.
Animal infection. All animal experiments were approved (licence 2535-26742,
Kantonales Veterina
¨ramt Basel-Stadt) and were performed according to local
guidelines (Tierschutz-Verordnung, Basel-Stadt) and the Swiss animal protection
law (Tierschutz-Gesetz). Female 10 weeks old wt C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier) were
infected subcutaneously with 104 CFUs of indicated stationary-phase F. novicida
strain in 50 ml PBS. Mice were killed 48 h post infection. Bacterial load of spleen
and liver was analysed by plating the bacteria on MHA plates. The plates were
incubated for 24 h at 37 �C. IL-18 levels in the blood were measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (eBioscience). No randomization or
‘blinding’ of researchers to sample identity was used.
Statistical analysis. Statistical data analysis was done using Prism 6.0h
(GraphPad Software, Inc.). To evaluate the difference between two groups
(T6SS per cell, T6SS assembly speed, subcellular localization of T6SS, bacterial
survival, cell death, cytokine release, phagosomal escape, bacterial growth and
IFN production) the unpaired two-tailed t-test with Welch’s correction was used.
Animal experiments were evaluated with a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. P values
are given in the figure legends.
Data availability. The authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this
study are available within the paper and its Supplementary Information files.
