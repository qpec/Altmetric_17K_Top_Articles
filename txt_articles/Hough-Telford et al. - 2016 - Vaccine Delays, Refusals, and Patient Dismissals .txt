abstract
BACKGROUND: Parental noncompliance with the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention immunization schedule is an increasing public health 
concern. We examined the frequency of requests for vaccine delays and refusals and the 
impact on US pediatricians’ behavior.
METHODS: Using national American Academy of Pediatrics Periodic Surveys from 2006 and 
2013, we describe pediatrician perceptions of prevalence of (1) vaccine refusals and delays, 
(2) parental reasons for refusals and/or delays, and (3) physician dismissals. Questions 
about vaccine delays were asked only in 2013. We examined the frequency, reasons for, 
and management of both vaccine refusals and delays by using bivariate and multivariable 
analyses, which were controlled for practice characteristics, demographics, and survey 
year.
RESULTS: The proportion of pediatricians reporting parental vaccine refusals increased 
from 74.5% in 2006 to 87.0% in 2013 (P < .001). Pediatricians perceive that parents are 
increasingly refusing vaccinations because parents believe they are unnecessary (63.4% 
in 2006 vs 73.1% in 2013; P = .002). A total of 75.0% of pediatricians reported that parents 
delay vaccines because of concern about discomfort, and 72.5% indicated that they delay 
because of concern for immune system burden. In 2006, 6.1% of pediatricians reported 
“always” dismissing patients for continued vaccine refusal, and by 2013 that percentage 
increased to 11.7% (P = .004).
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians reported increased vaccine refusal between 2006 and 2013. 
They perceive that vaccine-refusing parents increasingly believe that immunizations are 
unnecessary. Pediatricians continue to provide vaccine education but are also dismissing 
patients at higher rates.

Vaccine Delays, Refusals, and Patient Dismissals: A Survey 
of Pediatricians. Pediatrics. 2016;138(3):e20162127
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Vaccine 
refusals and delays result in increased numbers of 
undervaccinated and unvaccinated children in the 
United States. The challenges that these refusals and 
delays are placing on pediatric practices appears to 
be increasing.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: We found that almost 
all US pediatricians encounter vaccine delays and 
refusals. They perceive that vaccine refusals are 
increasing and that parental reasons are changing. 
In the past decade, pediatricians have become 
increasingly likely to dismiss patients for continued 
refusals.

Listed as one of the top public health 
achievements of the 20th century 
by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC), vaccines have 
changed the face of childhood and 
adult disease in the United States. 
1, 
 
2 
Among US children born between 
1994 and 2013, vaccinations will 
prevent ~322 million illnesses, 
~21 million hospitalizations, and 
~732 000 deaths in their lifetimes. 
3 
Domestic policies mandating 
childhood immunizations have led 
to high US immunization rates 
4, 
5 
and to the near elimination of most 
vaccine-preventable diseases. 
6, 
 
7 In 
recent years, however, some of these 
illnesses have made a resurgence in 
the United States and globally. 
6, 
 
8 
 
– 
12 
Decreasing parental acceptance of 
the benefits and safety of vaccines 
has resulted in increasing rates of 
nonmedical vaccine exemptions and 
of children who are underimmunized 
and unimmunized. 
13 
 
 
– 
18 Historical 
data suggest that the reasons for 
these refusals and delays (also called 
alternative vaccine schedules) may 
be changing over time.19, 
 
20
Recent behavioral literature 
has examined the complexity 
surrounding parental motivation 
and decision to delay or refuse 
vaccinations, loosely referred to 
as vaccine hesitancy. 
21 
 
– 
24 With the 
regular frequency with which parents 
question vaccines25 
 
 
– 
29 and the 
significant amount of time needed 
to counsel and educate parents 
on this topic (often at the expense 
of other anticipatory guidance27), 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) policymakers and pediatric 
providers have a strong interest 
in understanding US pediatricians’ 
experiences with vaccine refusals, 
delays, and provider responses to 
vaccine refusals.
The AAP has assessed the extent of 
vaccine hesitancy experienced by 
its members through its Periodic 
Surveys. 
30 Using 2 Periodic Surveys 
that asked about vaccines, 1 from 
2006 and the other from 2013, we 
sought to examine pediatrician 
experiences with parental requests 
for vaccine delays and refusals. 
We also aimed to assess the extent 
to which vaccine refusal affects 
pediatricians’ practice, both in the 
provision of education to parents and 
patient dismissal. We hypothesized 
that reasons for vaccine delay and 
refusal, as perceived by physicians, 
are similar; vaccine refusals have 
increased in 2013 compared with 
2006; and pediatricians were more 
likely to dismiss patients in 2013 
than in 2006.
METHODS
Periodic Surveys
Data were obtained from the AAP 
Periodic Survey of Fellows in 2013 
(PS84) and 2006 (PS66). 
30 Periodic 
Surveys are conducted 3 or 4 times 
per year by the AAP on various topics 
of importance to pediatricians. The 
sole topic of both PS66 and PS84 was 
immunizations (see Supplemental 
Information); we analyzed questions 
from the “Vaccine Safety” Section 
in PS66 and from the “Vaccine 
Refusal/Delay” Section in PS84 (see 
Supplemental Information). Both 
surveys used a unique, random 
sample of nonretired US members 
of the AAP. The surveys were pilot 
tested with a random sample of 
about 200 US AAP members. The 
content for both surveys was created 
by pediatrician advisors to the AAP 
and the CDC Childhood Immunization 
Support Program. Both surveys were 
approved by the AAP Institutional 
Review Board as exempt from human 
subjects review.
The 2006 Periodic Survey was 
mailed to 1620 AAP members, with 
6 follow-up contacts made between 
July and November and a postcard 
reminder to nonrespondents 
between the second and third 
mailings. The 2013 Periodic Survey 
was mailed to 1622 AAP members, 
with 6 follow-up contacts made 
between October 2012 and March 
2013. A $2 bill and a flyer were 
included in the first mailing. After 
the second and fourth mailings, 
nonrespondents were contacted via 
e-mail offering the option to respond 
electronically.
In both 2006 and 2013, demographic 
information, practice characteristics, 
and information about vaccine 
refusals and patient dismissals 
were collected. Pediatricians were 
asked in both years whether they 
had encountered vaccine refusals 
within the past 12 months and 
asked to estimate the proportion 
of parents in their practice who 
refused 1, some, or all vaccines. 
Subsequent questions included 
impressions of parental reasons for 
the refusal, how frequently (always, 
sometimes, never) they provide 
vaccine education, how successful 
they thought the education was at 
achieving vaccination, the average 
length of time between initial 
refusal and permission to vaccinate, 
and the frequency with which the 
respondent dismissed patients 
(always, sometimes, never) for 
continued vaccine refusal. Questions 
about vaccine delays (frequency and 
impressions of parental reasons) only 
were included in the 2013 survey. 
Pediatricians were asked to provide 
estimates for the survey questions 
but did not perform chart reviews.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses on both surveys were 
limited to pediatricians who provided 
patient care and age-appropriate 
immunizations as reflected in the 
AAP and CDC Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices 
immunization schedule (n = 629 in 
2006; n = 627 in 2013). Pediatricians 
who do not routinely administer 
vaccines were excluded. We used 
χ2 test and t tests to compare 
differences between the 2 survey 
years for categorical and continuous 
(in  
Table 1) variables, respectively. 
Multiple logistic regression models 
were fitted separately for each

survey year to investigate how US 
region and practice location were 
related to vaccine delays, refusal, and 
pediatrician dismissal of patients. 
In modeling dismissal outcome, 
we also included age and gender of 
the physician. If region or practice 
location was found to be significant 
in the model, we constructed 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
odds ratios to perform pairwise 
comparisons. A priori we were 
interested in 3 pairwise comparisons 
for region (West as reference) and 
for practice location (urban, inner 
city as reference). For pediatrician 
impressions of parental reasons 
for vaccine delays in 2013, we 
constructed a 95% CI for the 
proportion of pediatricians selecting 
a particular reason for parental 
delays. For reasons for refusal, we 
compared the proportions in 2006 
and 2013 by using a χ2 test.
To determine significance of the 
variables in the models for delays 
and refusals, we used a Bonferroni 
method of determining significance 
(ie, P < .0083 [0.05/6]) to account 
for multiple testing due to fitting 
3 different logistic models with 2 
variables being tested in each model. 
Similarly, we used P < .0083 to 
determine significance in comparing 
the proportions between 2006 and 
2013 of pediatricians selecting the 
perceived reasons for refusal (total 
of 6 reasons provided in the survey). 
For all other testing, we used the 
cutoff of P < .05. All analyses were 
conducted in SAS version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Of the 1620 AAP members who 
received surveys in 2006, 852 
completed surveys were received 
(52.6% response). Of the 1622 
members who received surveys in 
2013, 854 total surveys were received 
(52.7% response). Pediatricians were 
excluded if they did not participate 
directly in patient care or did not 
offer age-appropriate immunizations, 
resulting in 629 respondents in 
2006 and 627 respondents in 2013 
who were used in the analyses. 
Characteristics of respondents in each 
survey year are presented in  
Table 1.
Vaccine Delays (Alternative Vaccine 
Schedules)
Questions about vaccine delays 
were asked in 2013 only; 87.6% of 
pediatricians reported experiencing 
parental requests to delay ≥1 
vaccine in the preceding 12 months. 
Pediatricians estimated on average 
that 7.3% of all parents in their 
practice requested to delay 1 
vaccine, 7.1% requested to delay 
some vaccines, and 4.3% requested 
to delay all vaccines, totaling 18.7% 
of all parents who requested to 
delay ≥1 vaccine. The results of 
the multiple logistic regressions 
demonstrated no statistically 
significant differences between 
regions of the United States (P = .06) 
but found significant differences by 
practice location (P < .001) ( 
Table 2), 
with urban, inner-city pediatricians 
being less likely than those in other 
locations to encounter requests for 
delays. Confidence intervals were 
wide among rural pediatricians 
because of the very high percentage 
(98.7%) of parental requests for 
vaccine delays. Therefore, a paucity 
of data exist from rural pediatricians 
who did not experience vaccine 
delays, which would provide more 
reliable estimates for comparison.
Pediatricians’ perceptions of 
parental reasons for vaccine delays 
are summarized in  
Table 3. Their 
perceptions are that the most 
common reasons parents seek to 
delay vaccines are concern for their 
child’s discomfort (75.0%; 95% CI, 
71.3%–78.7%) and the fear that too 
many vaccines are a burden on their 
child’s immune system (72.5%; 95% 
CI, 68.6%–76.3%).

Vaccine Refusals
In 2006, 74.5% of pediatricians 
reported that they had experienced 
parental vaccine refusals in the 
previous 12 months; by 2013 this 
number had increased to 87.0% (P 
< .001, odds ratio [OR] 2.29; 95% CI, 
1.69–3.10). Pediatricians estimated 
the percentage of parents in their 
practice who refused 1 vaccine 
(average of 4.5% in 2006 vs 8.6% in 
2013, P < .001), some vaccines (2.5% 
vs 4.8%, P < .001), and all vaccines 
(2.1% vs 3.3%, P = .07).
 
Figure 1 summarizes respondents’ 
perceptions of parental reasons 
for vaccine refusal in both survey 
years. In 2013, the most commonly 
cited reason pediatricians believe 
parents refuse vaccines was because 
parents view them as unnecessary 
(73.1%). This represents a significant 
increase from 63.4% in 2006 (P = 
.002). However, 3 of the 6 reasons for 
vaccine refusal significantly declined 
in frequency, as perceived by 
pediatricians, including the concern 
for autism and/or thimerosal (74.2% 
in 2006 vs 64.3% in 2013; P = .002).
 
Table 4 demonstrates that both 
region and practice area were 
significant predictors for vaccine 
refusal; region was significant only 
in 2006, with western pediatricians 
being more likely than southern 
or midwestern pediatricians to 
experience vaccine refusals. By 
practice location, results were 
similar for both years: Urban, inner-
city pediatricians were least likely 
to experience vaccine refusals 
compared with pediatricians 
practicing in other locations.
Pediatrician Response
In 2006, 6.1% of pediatricians 
reported “always” dismissing 
patients for continued vaccine 
refusal, and by 2013 this number 
nearly doubled to 11.7% (P = 
.004). Of the pediatricians who had 
dismissed patients, 79.9% in 2013 
and 87.4% in 2006 listed that their 
reason was lack of trust between 
physician and patient. Asked in 2013 
only, 80.5% of pediatricians listed 
concern for other patients as a main 
reason for patient dismissal for 
continued vaccine refusal.
Results from multiple logistic 
regressions of pediatricians who 
reported “always” dismissing 
patients for continued vaccine 
refusals are presented in  
Table 5. 
Increasing age was associated with 
increasing likelihood of patient 
dismissal. In 2006, pediatricians 
who always dismiss were not 
significantly different with regard to 
gender, region of the United States, 
or practice area. By 2013, though, 
significant differences were found 
by US region (P = .03) and practice 
location (P = .02); pediatricians in 
the West were less likely to dismiss 
patients compared with the Midwest 
(OR 3.51; 95% CI, 1.10–11.18) and 
South (OR 4.62; 95% CI, 1.52–14.06). 
Suburban pediatricians in 2013 were 
more likely than those in urban, 
inner-city locations to dismiss (OR 
3.33; 95% CI, 1.11–9.96).
Most pediatricians in both survey 
years reported providing vaccine 
education to vaccine-refusing parents 
(95.8% in 2006, 94.0% in 2013; 
P = .20). In 2006 and 2013, pediatricians 
reported that on average 31.9% 
(SD = 30.7%) and 34.4% (SD = 29.8%), 
respectively, of their patients who 
initially refused a vaccine changed 
their minds after educational 
efforts. In 2013, an average of 15.9 
(SD = 23) weeks elapsed between 
initial refusal and permission 
for the vaccine according to the 
pediatricians’ estimates. However,

DISCUSSION
Pediatricians perceive that 
parents increasingly question 
the need to follow the AAP and 
CDC vaccine schedule. Nearly all 
pediatricians surveyed in 2013 
encountered parents who refused 
and delayed vaccines, which is in 
line with previous literature. 
26, 
 
27, 
 
31 
– 
34 Pediatricians reported that the 
percentage of parents who refuse 
some vaccines almost doubled 
between 2006 and 2013, and they 
described that almost 1 in 5 parents 
in their practice requested to delay 
≥1 vaccines. Our findings highlight 
that in a busy practice, vaccine 
refusals and delays occur daily (if not 
multiple times per day). Pediatricians 
report that they continue to provide 
education to vaccine-refusing and 
delaying parents at high rates. 
Despite these continued efforts, the 
rate of pediatricians who always 
dismiss patients for continued 
vaccine refusal has nearly doubled 
across survey years.
Counter to our original hypothesis, 
we found that the most commonly 
cited reasons perceived by 
pediatricians for vaccine delays 
and refusals are actually different. 
Our study demonstrated that 
pediatricians perceive that parents 
delay vaccines most often because 
of concerns about harmful effects 
of the vaccines on the child, such as 
discomfort or burden to their young 
child’s immune systems. However, 
to our knowledge this is the first 
study to demonstrate the perception 
among pediatricians of increasing 
rates of parents who believe vaccines 
are unnecessary as a reason for 
refusal. Asking parents why they are 
requesting to delay or refuse vaccines 
can provide a window of opportunity 
for providers to tailor their guidance 
accordingly, as suggested in the AAP’s 
new Clinical Report “Countering 
Vaccine Hesitancy, 
” 
35 and our data 
help guide the content of those 
conversations. Future studies should 
focus on specific, unique approaches 
that address parents who refuse and 
those who delay separately.
In both survey years, pediatricians 
reported that they were only able 
to convince about one-third of 
vaccine-refusing parents to change 
their minds by providing education. 
A recent randomized trial assessed 
different communication techniques 
to improve measles–mumps–rubella 
vaccine immunization rates. 
36 
None of the strategies in the study 
increased parental plans to give 
the vaccine, and among those who 
had the least favorable vaccine 
views, the intent to immunize after 
the study actually declined. This 
finding underscores the complex 
psychosocial underpinnings of 
messages aimed at parents who 
delay or refuse vaccines. It illustrates 
the importance of initiating 
conversations about vaccines with 
an understanding of the reasons for 
parents’ concerns, as captured in 
our study, to best devise effective 
strategies to promote vaccinations in 
the refusing and delaying parent.
Previous studies of vaccine hesitancy 
suggest that the relative rarity of 
vaccine-preventable diseases may 
have caused the public’s collective 
memory of the consequences of 
these illnesses to fade, leading 
some parents to view vaccines as 
less crucial to the health of their 
children.

that parents believe vaccines are 
unnecessary supports this possibility. 
Pediatricians continue to perceive 
high rates of refusals due to parental 
concerns about autism and/or 
thimerosal, but our results document 
for the first time that this misplaced 
concern has decreased in frequency 
in recent years (from 74.2% in 2006 
to 64.3% in 2013; P = .002), as have 
concerns about the safety of vaccines 
(from 73.7% in 2006 to 66.6% in 
2013; P = .02). If pediatricians’ 
perceptions are correct about 
parental motivations for refusing 
vaccines, these data represent a 
significant shift in our understanding 
of the motivations behind vaccine 
refusals, and to our knowledge it 
has not been recognized in recent 
literature on this subject. Awareness 
of these misplaced perceptions 
can directly inform research into 
communication techniques to 
effectively address these concerns 
within the short duration of office 
visits. Pediatricians rarely listed cost 
as a reason for delay and refusal, and 
it has probably declined even more 
since 2013 with full implementation 
of the Affordable Care Act.
We identified geographic differences 
in the rates of vaccine refusals 
and patient dismissals; western 
pediatricians were generally 
more likely to experience vaccine 
refusals and less likely to dismiss 
patients. These data are similar 
to those of a recent study on 
patient dismissals 
34 as well as US 
epidemiologic data showing that high 
rates of nonmedical exemptions and 
unvaccinated children are in western 
and midwestern US states.

Although the AAP and CDC continue 
to encourage pediatricians to care for 
underimmunized and unimmunized 
patients, 
 
28, 
 
42 our results show that 
increasing numbers of pediatricians 
are dismissing patients for continued 
vaccine refusal, a finding that is in 
line with recently published literature 
on the subject. 
26, 
 
34 Resolutions have 
been debated at recent AAP Annual 
Leadership Forum meetings to allow 
more flexibility in the AAP position.43, 
 
44 
Our data help explain the growing 
degree of frustration among many 
pediatricians when they are unable to 
guide families to embrace life-saving 
vaccines.
Our study has several limitations. 
First, the potential for recall bias 
among the respondents was present. 
Also, our survey results represent 
pediatrician impressions and 
perceptions about parental vaccine 
hesitancy and may not accurately 
reflect true parental attitudes and 
feelings about vaccines. The surveys 
may have limited generalizability for 
pediatricians who are not members 
of the AAP, although about 62% of 
board-certified pediatricians belong 
to the AAP. 
45 Although there were 
slight differences in age between 
respondents and nonrespondents to 
both surveys, minimal response bias 
has been found across AAP national 
surveys of pediatricians. 
46 Our 
analysis of data was limited because 
we adjusted only for variables of 
interest; confounders that were 
not included for refusal and delay 
analyses were practice setting, 
patient visits per week, percentage of 
patients with public health insurance, 
practice ownership, age, and gender 
(the latter 2 variables were included 
in the patient dismissals outcome 
in  
Table 5). In addition, the survey 
did not define the term alternative 
vaccine schedule, nor was the 
distinction made between parents 
who continually delay vaccines as a 
method for refusal and those who 
accept vaccines on an alternative 
schedule; therefore, the term 
could have been open to different 
interpretations. The survey did not 
ask participants to identify which 
vaccines were most often refused. In 
addition, the survey did not define 
continued refusal when asking about 
patient dismissal. Because the 2006 
survey did not ask about vaccine 
delays, respondents for that survey 
year may have been more likely to 
categorize parents who were actually 
delayers into the refusal questions.
CONCLUSIONS
Pediatricians report that vaccine 
refusals have increased between 
2006 and 2013, and they believe 
that parents who delay vaccines 
have different motivations than 
parents who refuse vaccines. From 
the perspective of the pediatricians, 
parents who delay vaccines may 
do so because of concern for their 
child’s discomfort and concern 
about immune system burden, 
whereas vaccine refusers are more 
likely to believe that vaccines are 
unnecessary. Between 2006 and 
2013, pediatricians were increasingly 
likely to dismiss parents who refuse 
vaccines despite evolving AAP 
recommendations to keep patients in 
their practice who are unvaccinated 
or incompletely vaccinated. More 
research is needed to identify 
effective techniques to address the 
concerns of vaccine-hesitant parents 
as identified in this report.
