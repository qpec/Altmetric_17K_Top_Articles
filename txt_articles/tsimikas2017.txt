 REVIEW TOPIC OF THE WEEK
A Test in Context: Lipoprotein(a)
Diagnosis, Prognosis, Controversies, and Emerging Therapies
Sotirios Tsimikas, MD
ABSTRACT
Evidence that elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and calcific aortic valve
stenosis (CAVS) is substantial. Development of isoform-independent assays, in concert with genetic, epidemiological,
translational, and pathophysiological insights, have established Lp(a) as an independent, genetic, and likely causal risk
factor for CVD and CAVS. These observations are consistent across a broad spectrum of patients, risk factors, and
concomitant therapies, including patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <70 mg/dl. Statins tend to increase
Lp(a) levels, possibly contributing to the “residual risk” noted in outcomes trials and at the bedside. Recently approved
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-type 9 inhibitors and mipomersen lower Lp(a) 20% to 30%, and emerging
RNA-targeted therapies lower Lp(a) >80%. These approaches will allow testing of the “Lp(a) hypothesis” in clinical
trials. This review summarizes the current landscape of Lp(a), discusses controversies, and reviews emerging therapies to
reduce plasma Lp(a) levels to decrease risk of CVD and CAVS. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;69:692–711) © 2017 The Author.

to
the
reduction of CVD mortality. However, despite these
advances, w40% of all deaths can be attributed to
CVD (1). Furthermore, in the short time window in
which clinical trials evaluate therapies, only 20% to
30% of patients benefit, and more events develop
in patients on active therapy than are prevented.
These observations suggest that the presence of
additional

contributes
to
CVD risk.
Lipid disorders can be broadly divided into 4
“clinical” categories: elevated low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (LDL-C), low high-density lipopro-
tein
cholesterol
(HDL-C),
elevated
triglycerides,
and elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]). In the current

containing
lipoproteins (very low-density lipopro-
tein, intermediate-density lipoprotein, LDL, Lp[a]) are

risk. In contrast, variations in genes associated with
higher HDL-C or drugs that raise HDL-C are not asso-
ciated with improvement in cardiovascular risk (2,3).

least studied of these 4 lipid disorders. However, this
is rapidly changing with the awareness of its role in

 CVD and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS), and the
potential of novel therapies to substantially lower
Lp(a). This review summarizes the Lp(a) field from a
translational and clinical perspective with its rela-
tionship with CVD and CAVS.
HOW IS Lp(a) DIFFERENT FROM LDL AND
PLASMINOGEN?
Lp(a) is composed of an LDL-like particle in which
apoB is covalently bound by a single disulfide bond to
apolipoprotein(a)
(apo[a]),
the
pathognomonic
component of Lp(a) (Figure 1). For unknown etiolog-
ical and physiological reasons, apo(a) has evolved
from the plasminogen gene through duplication and
remodeling over the millennia (4). Plasminogen con-
tains 5 kringles (KI to KV) and a protease domain.
Plasminogen is a proenzyme, which is converted to
the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin by plasminogen ac-
tivators, such as urokinase and tissue plasminogen
activator,
either
endogenously
or
iatrogenically.
Apo(a) does not contain KI to KIII of plasminogen, but
instead contains 10 subtypes of KIV (with KIV1 and
KIV3–10 present in 1 copy, and KIV2 present in 1 to >40
copies), 1 copy of KV, and an inactive protease
domain. Unlike apoB, apo(a) does not contain lipid
domains or transport lipid, but instead, it is hydro-
philic, and can bind to denuded and exposed lysine-
rich vascular endothelium, similar to and also in
competition with plasminogen. However, except for
high Lp(a) levels, on a molar basis, plasminogen is
almost always in excess of apo(a), which calls into
question its in vivo potency in inhibiting plasmin-
ogen activity in most patients.
Within populations, there is extensive apo(a) pro-
tein size heterogeneity, with >40 different isoforms,
and thus, >40 different sizes of Lp(a) particles, which
is a unique occurrence unlike other circulating pro-
teins, which usually have 1 defined mass (5). Within
individuals, >80% carry 2 different-sized apo(a) iso-
forms, each inherited from 1 parent. For example, an
individual may carry 2 small isoforms, a small and a
large one, or 2 large isoforms, with plasma Lp(a)
levels determined by the net production of apo(a) in
each isoform, with the major contribution generally
driven by the small isoform (Figure 1).
METABOLISM OF Lp(a)
Circulating Lp(a) levels are primarily determined by
the LPA gene locus, without significant dietary or
environmental influences (6). Apo(a) is synthesized
almost exclusively in the liver, but the site of as-
sembly of Lp(a) has not been confirmed, and may be
within the hepatocyte, the space of Disse, or the
plasma compartment (7). The steps of as-
sembly include apo(a) docking to LDL, and
then formation of a covalent disulfide bond
between KIV-9 of apo(a) and apoB of LDL. It
appears that the LDL component is derived
from a newly synthesized apoB-100 and is
not derived from a very low-density lipo-
protein precursor. Lp(a) has a longer plasma
residence time than LDL. This may due to
the fact that the apo(a) component, which is
covalently attached near the LDL receptor
(LDLR) binding site of apoB and which can
be larger than apoB, interferes with docking
to the LDLR, reduces clearance through the
LDLR, and also requires clearance through
alternative pathways. The size of the apo(a)
isoform correlates modestly and inversely
with plasma Lp(a) levels due to the consti-
tutive hepatocyte production of apo(a), and
because
small
isoforms
can
be
made
in
higher molar quantities per unit time versus
large
isoforms.
The
mechanisms
through
which Lp(a) is cleared from plasma remain
controversial. The LDLR likely has a modest
role, as evidenced by the fact that statins
raise LDLR numbers, yet do not lower Lp(a),
and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-
type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors increase LDLR numbers,
yet
reduce
Lp(a).
However,
animal
and
human
turnover studies with labeled Lp(a) suggest minimal
(if any) effect, but cell culture studies and clinical
phenotypes of LDLR deficiency, such as those in
patients with familial hypercholesterolemia due to
LDLR mutations, show higher Lp(a) levels than un-
affected siblings. The kidney, as well as other un-
defined clearance mechanisms, such as scavenger
receptor B1 and plasminogen receptors, and pro-
teolytic cleavage of apo(a), may also have a role in
catabolism.
WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS THROUGH
WHICH Lp(a) MEDIATES CVD?
Lp(a) contributes to CVD risk via multiple, nonre-
dundant mechanisms. Lp(a) quantitatively carries all
of the atherogenic risk of LDL particles, including
their propensity to oxidize after entry into the vessel
wall,
creating
highly
immunogenic
and
proin-
flammatory oxidized LDL (8). However, on an equi-
molar basis, Lp(a) is more atherogenic than LDL
because, by definition, it not only contains all the
proatherogenic
components
of
LDL,
but
also
of
apo(a). Apo(a) potentiates atherothrombosis through
additional
mechanisms,
including
inflammation

Composition of Lp(a)
Lipoprotein [Lp(a)] is composed of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) covalently bound to apolipoprotein (a) [apo(a)], which is derived from kringle IV (KIV) and KV, and
the protease domain of plasminogen. Plasminogen has 1 copy each of KI to KV and an active protease domain. Apo(a) contains 10 subtypes of KIV repeats, composed of
1 copy each of KIV1, multiple copies of KIV2, and 1 copy of KIV3�10, KV, and an inactive protease-like (P) domain. In these examples, apo(a) isoforms of 4, 8, 24, and 40
KIV2 repeats are shown, representing 13, 17, 33, and 49 total KIV repeats. Oxidized phospholipids (OxPL), represented here by 1-palmitoyl-2-oxovaleroyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphocholine (POVPC), are present covalently bound to apo(a), and also dissolved in the lipid phase of apoB-100.

 through
its
content
of
oxidized
phospholipids
(OxPL), the presence of lysine binding sites that
allow accumulation in the arterial wall, and potential
antifibrinolytic
effects
by
inhibiting
plasminogen
activation
(Figure
2)
(reviewed
in
Spence
and
Koschinsky [9]). However, Lp(a)-mediated CVD risk
should
be
considered
in
a
quantitative
manner
because most patients (70% to 80%) at risk for CVD
have low Lp(a) levels, such that LDL-C is present in
significant excess to Lp(a), and therefore, most of
the apoB-driven risk is due to a higher number of
LDL particles. However, as Lp(a) levels increase to
>25 to 30 mg/dl, which represents w30% of the
population, the risk of Lp(a) rises in a linear fashion
according to absolute circulating Lp(a) mass.
The OxPL components of Lp(a), which can be
present in the lipid phase of Lp(a) and also be
covalently
bound
to
apo(a)
(10–12),
are
proin-
flammatory and impart many of the proatherogenic
properties of Lp(a) (Figure 2). This has been shown in
clinical studies by measuring levels of OxPL on
apoB-containing particles (OxPL-apoB), which pri-
marily reflect the OxPL content of Lp(a) (10,11),
which demonstrates that elevated OxPL-apoB levels
are either similar or superior predictors to Lp(a) in
the diagnosis or prognosis of CVD (13–18) and CAVS
(19,20).
In
a
recent
study
that
validated
these
mechanisms in vivo, patients with elevated Lp(a)
had
increased
arterial
inflammation
detected
by
increased accumulation of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose in
the carotid arteries and aorta. In addition, their
monocytes demonstrated increased production of
proinflammatory cytokines upon stimulation and an
enhanced capacity to transmigrate in an in vitro
system,
which
reflected
vascular
penetration
of
monocytes through an endothelial cell barrier. These
proinflammatory
effects
were
associated
with
enhanced in vivo monocyte trafficking to the arterial
wall using autologous radiolabeled monocytes, and
were abrogated by inactivating OxPL with a specific
antibody or
using recombinant apo(a) constructs
lacking OxPL, which suggested that these effects

 were largely driven by the presence of OxPL on
Lp(a) (12). In separate studies, OxPL on Lp(a) also
up-regulated
inflammatory
genes,
and
induced
release of interleukin-8 (21) and monocyte chemo-
attractant protein-1 (22). Monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 is physically present on Lp(a), and thus,
may enhance its entry into the vessel wall. Finally,
apo(a) contains lysine-binding sites that allows it to
bind tightly to exposed surfaces on denuded endo-
thelium,
enter,
and
accumulate
into
subintimal
spaces
or
aortic
valve
leaflets,
which
leads
to
inflammation. Additional mechanisms are shown in
Figure 2.
Human coronary lesions from subjects with sud-
den
death
or
carotid
endarterectomy
specimens
showed a progressive increase in the presence of
Lp(a) and OxPL as lesions progressed, with the
highest presence of these epitopes in ruptured pla-
ques (Figures 3A to 3D) (23). These findings were
later confirmed in patients who underwent coro-
nary, carotid, renal, and peripheral interventions, in
which similar strong immunostaining for Lp(a) and
OxPL, and the direct presence of OxPL in debris
from
distal
protection
devices
by
liquid
chromatography-tandem
mass
spectrometry,
was
documented (Figures 3E and 3F) (24).
WHAT IS THE CLINICAL EVIDENCE THAT
ELEVATED Lp(a) MEDIATES CVD?
Elevated
Lp(a)
mediates
myocardial
infarction,
stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Over the last
decade, data in subjects without previous CVD from
epidemiological
studies
and
meta-analyses
(25),
Mendelian randomization studies (26), and genome-
wide association studies (27,28) have conclusively
shown that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with a
higher risk of CVD. In 63,746 coronary artery disease
(CAD) cases and 130,681 control subjects from the
CardiogramPlus4CD Consortium, 46 loci and 104 in-
dependent
variants
that
reached
genome-wide
significance for susceptibility for CAD were identi-
fied, with the most potent variants clustered in net-
works linked to lipid metabolism and inflammation.
Analyzing individual variants revealed that the most
potent genetic association with CAD was the LPA lo-
cus, which was numerically more potent than LDL-,
PCSK9-, and 9p21-related variants. This observation
that the LPA gene is 1 of the strongest (if not the
strongest) monogenetic risk factors for CAD is un-
derappreciated, and points to the potential of tar-
geting Lp(a) lowering to reduce CVD risk with specific
therapies (29).
In meta-analyses of clinical outcomes, the risk of
Lp(a) for CVD is curvilinear (25). In contrast, genetic
studies, which reflect life-long elevated Lp(a) and
less
confounding
by
the
multiple
heterogeneous
limitations in meta-analyses, show a more potent
and linear risk, with odds ratios as high as 4 rela-
tive to subjects with low levels (27,30). Figure 4
represents the salient studies that show such asso-
ciations, but the overall data in published reports
are consistent in their preponderance of evidence of
a causal association. Finally, there is evidence that
some individuals have alleles that do not express
apo(a); therefore, they have either very low or ab-
sent circulating Lp(a) levels, have a reduced risk of
CVD, but they are not at increased risk for non-CVD
events, which is consistent with the causality of
Lp(a) for vascular disease (31,32).
WHAT
IS
THE
CLINICAL
EVIDENCE
THAT
Lp(a)
MEDIATES CAVS? Although it has long been sus-
pected that Lp(a) is a risk factor for CAVS; only
recently has Lp(a) become appreciated as a potent
risk factor (33). Recent studies have shown that of
>2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
analyzed, the LPA SNP rs10455872, which is associ-
ated with markedly elevated Lp(a) levels, was the
only monogenetic risk factor for aortic valve calcifi-
cation and CAVS in multiple racial groups (34–37).
Similar to the studies with myocardial infarction, a

 strong case for causality can be made because these
studies linked a genetic trait (LPA SNPs) that could
not be altered by environment or diet to a quantita-
tive and substantial (5- to 20-fold) increase in plasma
Lp(a) levels, and to a clinical phenotype of aortic
valve calcification and CAVS.
However, the genetic readouts are often binary
(i.e., risk of disease; yes/no), and additional insights
into natural history would be helpful to clinicians
who manage such patients over time. In that regard,
recent data from the ASTRONOMER Trial (Aortic
Stenosis Progression Observation: Measuring Effects
of Rosuvastatin) (38) showed that patients with pre-
existing
mild-to-moderate
aortic
stenosis
and
elevated levels of Lp(a) and OxPL-apoB (third tertile
or >58.5 mg/dl and >5.5 nM, respectively) had a faster
progression rate, with annual changes in peak aortic
jet velocities of 0.26 � 0.26 m/s per year versus 0.17 �
0.21 m/s per year in the highest versus the lowest
tertiles (Figures 5A and 5B), and a need for aortic valve
replacement (Figures 5C and 5D), which occurred in
20.4% of the entire group (19). Similar rates of pro-
gression were noted in patients with tricuspid valves
versus bicuspid valves, which represented 48% of the
study
patients.
Interestingly,
younger
patients
(median: younger than 57 years of age) had nearly
double the progression rate and the highest need for
aortic valve replacement, which is consistent with the
primary driver of genetically elevated Lp(a). Inter-
estingly,
rosuvastatin
was
shown
not
to
affect
progression of CAVS, and it actually increased Lp(a)
levels
by
20%
and
OxPL-apoB
levels
by
46%
(Figures 5E and 5F). However, it has been acknowl-
edged that the beneficial effects of lowering LDL-C
may confound the appropriate interpretation of the
effect of statins on CAVS in these trials. There are
several potential explanations for these findings. For
example, an adverse effect of raising Lp(a) with a
statin
might
be
offset
by
a
beneficial
effect
of
lowering LDL-C. Other possibilities include that most
patients had low Lp(a) on entry, only patients with an
initially high Lp(a) level would have been adversely
affected, and that the Lp(a)-raising effect of statins is
modest.
In more recent work, the enzyme autotaxin has
been identified as an important contributor molecule
in CAVS (39). Oxidation of phospholipids generates
lysophosphatidylcholine, which is present in calcified
aortic valves in mouse models and explanted calcified
human valves (39). Autotaxin is a lysophospholipase
that
converts
lysophosphatidylcholine
into
lyso-
phosphatidic acid, which promotes inflammation,
fibrosis, and cell motility. In a case–control study in
150 patients with CAVS plus CAD and 150 matched
patients with CAD without CAVS, patients with CAVS
had
elevated
autotaxin
mass
and
activity,
Lp(a)
(>50 mg/dl) and OxPL-apoB (>2.02 nM), and auto-
taxin activity in combination with either Lp(a) or
OxPL-apoB, which significantly increased the risk of
CAVS, with odds ratios of 3.46 and 5.48, respectively,

 compared with patients with lower levels (Figures 5G
and 5H) (20).
Therefore, a unifying hypothesis for the develop-
ment and progression of CAVS is that Lp(a) carries
both autotaxin and OxPL into aortic valve leaflets,
and
initiates
inflammation
and
calcification
via
OxPL metabolites that induce up-regulation of pro-
calcifying genes, which ultimately results in hemo-
dynamically significant disease and clinical sequelae
(Figure 5I) (33).
AREA OF CONTROVERSY I: WHAT ARE THE
AVAILABLE Lp(a) ASSAYS, AND IS THE
MEASUREMENT OF Lp(a) ADEQUATELY
STANDARDIZED FOR ROUTINE CLINICAL CARE?
Lp(a) levels are generally expressed as milligrams per
deciliter of the mass of the entire particle, which in-
cludes the protein content of apoB-100 and apo(a),
and their associated lipids (cholesterol, cholesteryl
esters, phospholipids, and triglycerides), as well as
carbohydrates attached to apo(a), or in nanomoles per
liter as a particle number of apo(a). Lp(a) mass assays
have an inherent limitation due to the heterogeneity
of Lp(a) particle sizes, making it difficult to stan-
dardize assays with appropriate calibrators. In addi-
tion, because most antibodies used in assays are
polyclonal and cross-react with multiple KIV2 repeats,
these assays may overestimate Lp(a) levels in patients
with large isoforms and underestimate levels in
patients with small isoforms. Most clinical labora-
tories have overcome this limitation by using appro-
priate calibrators, along with linking the results to
the World Health Organization/International Federa-
tion of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine
International Reference Reagent, making the assays
relatively
isoform
independent.
Lp(a)
cholesterol
content can also be estimated with gel electrophoresis
techniques, but these techniques are not validated in
terms of accuracy or in predictive value. This topic
was recently reviewed by Marcovina and Albers (40),
which provided full details of assay methodologies
and limitations. For routine clinical care, currently
available assays, except for Lp(a) cholesterol assays,
can be considered fairly accurate for separating low-
risk patients from high-risk patients, except perhaps
when patients are near the assay thresholds for what is
considered elevated, which is generally >30 mg/dl or
>75 nmol/l in the United States. Currently available
assays linked to the World Health Organization/In-
ternational
Federation
of
Clinical
Chemistry
and
Laboratory Medicine standard are able to detect high-
risk patients (i.e., levels >50 mg/dl or >125 nmol/l)
with acceptable accuracy. Future efforts should focus
on performing comparison studies of different assays
(41), and fully standardizing assays across all plat-
forms and instruments.
AREA OF CONTROVERSY II: WHAT ARE
CONSIDERED ELEVATED Lp(a) LEVELS AND
WHAT ARE APPROPRIATE RISK CUTOFFS
FOR CVD AND CAVS?
Previous data that showed an inflection for risk of
myocardial infarction at Lp(a) >30 mg/dl (42) were
recently
confirmed
by
a
large
meta-analysis
of
126,634 participants and 1.3 million person-years of
follow-up, in which the risk was curvilinear, but
started to accelerate at >24 mg/dl (25). Genome-wide
association studies and Mendelian randomization
studies were also consistent with these estimates
(26,27). In general, the higher the Lp(a) level, the
greater the average risk for CVD. Detailed data on
CAVS are not available for risk according to baseline
Lp(a) levels, except that risk was significantly higher
at >40 to 60 mg/dl (19,20,35,36). The European
Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) proposed <50 mg/dl
(approximately <100 to 125 nmol/l) as an optimal
level, which represents 20% of the population with
higher levels. However, this recommendation misses
risk in patients with levels between 25 and 50 mg/dl,
as shown by the Copenhagen data (43) and recent
Lp(a) analyses of randomized trials (44,45). The
2016 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for
the
Management
of
Dyslipidemia
consider
Lp(a)
>30 mg/dl to be a risk factor, and suggest measuring
Lp(a) to inform decision-making, particularly in pa-
tients at intermediate risk and those with a family
history of premature CAD, and in younger patients
who may not meet treatment risk criteria (46).
Unlike normally distributed LDL-C or other labo-
ratory values, Lp(a) levels are skewed leftward, and
most individuals (w70%) have values in the normal
range of <30 mg/dl. However, it must be emphasized
that
30%
of
the
global
population
amounts
to
w2 billion people with Lp(a) levels in the atherogenic
range. Both the German and U.K. apheresis guidelines
use Lp(a) >60 mg/dl to specifically allow reimburse-
ment for patients with both isolated Lp(a) elevation
and recurrent CVD events, or in conjunction with
uncontrolled elevated LDL-C.

 clinician and patient are most interested in being
able to recategorize the potential risk into a lower or
higher risk category, and to change therapy on the
basis of the value. This was addressed by the Bru-
neck study (47) in 826 subjects from the general
community with a 15-year prospective follow-up. In

 allowed reclassification of 39.6% of individuals into
either lower or higher risk categories, depending on
the Lp(a) level. Allele-specific Lp(a) levels and apo(a)
isoforms did not add to the predictive ability of the
Framingham risk score or Reynolds risk score, or the
Lp(a) level. These findings suggest that measuring
Lp(a) levels in intermediate-risk groups will allow
reclassification of risk in 4 of 10 patients (Figure 6).
The impact of risk restratification in not treating
with a statin has not been assessed prospectively,
whereas
the
benefit
of
a
statin
as
a
result
of
upgrading risk is high. Furthermore, when the dis-
tribution of risk has high frequency near dichoto-
mous boundaries of risk categories, a relatively small
change in absolute predicted risk can result in a
relatively
large
difference
in
classification,
as
demonstrated by Kamstrup et al. (26). Additional
studies
are
needed
to
validate
these
findings,
particularly with the new American College of Car-

 AREA OF CONTROVERSY IV: IS IT POSSIBLE
TO ONLY MEASURE Lp(a) ONCE IN A
PERSON’S LIFETIME TO ASCERTAIN RISK,
AND WHICH PATIENTS SHOULD HAVE A
Lp(a) LEVEL MEASURED?
Because >90% of circulating Lp(a) levels are geneti-
cally determined, and the levels are quantitatively
related to the LPA gene, with little influence from diet
and environment, and because plasma levels do not
fluctuate significantly around a pre-set baseline over a
lifetime,
this
test
can
be
considered
similar
to
measuring a SNP in a gene. However, unlike measuring
a particular SNP, there are tens (if not hundreds) of LPA
SNPs that can influence Lp(a) levels; thus, an Lp(a)
level is the most appropriate measurement (19,25–27).
Most laboratories charge $50 to $100 for an Lp(a) level;
therefore, this is likely to be a cost-effective test
because it only has to be done once for screening or
diagnostic purposes. Because most patients are not
aware of their Lp(a)-mediated risk, there is a rationale
to add an Lp(a) measurement to the lipid panel of a
patient in whom lipids are measured for the first time.
If Lp(a) is in the normal range, then subsequent
measurements are not needed, irrespective of any
change in the patient’s medical therapy.
In 2010, the EAS recommended Lp(a) measurement
once in all patients with premature CVD, and in pa-
tients with intermediate or high CVD risk, familial
hypercholesterolemia, family history of premature
CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite
statin treatment, or a 3% 10-year risk of fatal and/or
10% 10-year risk of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart
disease (44). The U.S. National Lipid Association
provided similar recommendations on testing (48).
The 2016 European Society of Cardiology/EAS guide-
lines recommended measurement of Lp(a) in selected
cases at high risk, in patients with a family history of
premature CVD, and for reclassification in subjects
with
borderline
risk,
with
a
Class
IIa,

Evidence: C (49).

of the Reynolds Risk Score only with a model considering the Reynolds Risk Score plus Lp(a) level. Net reclassification improvement (NRI)
denotes the classic retrospective categorical net NRI with calculations on the basis of 148 subjects with events and 502 subjects without
events and a complete follow-up over the 15-year period. *The Reynolds Risk Score contains information on age, sex, diabetes, smoking,

 (Figures 7A and 7B) (26,27,50–52). For example, in-
dividuals of African descent have the highest levels of
these, and are generally followed by South Asians,
Caucasians, Hispanics, and East Asians. The differ-
ences likely reflect the geographic migration of the
LPA gene out of Africa, with additional changes in
genetic architecture over the past w40 to 60 million
years because the LPA gene duplicated itself from the
plasminogen gene and expanded in humans over the
last 3 million years or so. It is now evident that
elevated Lp(a) is an independent CVD risk factor in all
racial groups studied to date (51,53–57). For example,
in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities)
study, with 20 years of follow-up in 3,467 black and
9,851 white subjects, Lp(a) levels were positively and
similarly associated with CVD events in both groups,
despite a larger range of distribution in black subjects
compared with white subjects (Figure 7C). However,
because the prevalence of elevated Lp(a) is different
among racial groups, the overall clinical expression of
disease and incidence ascribed to Lp(a) relative to
other risk factors may be variable.
AREA OF CONTROVERSY VI: IS Lp(a) A RISK
FACTOR WHEN LDL-C IS CONTROLLED?
Previous data from angiographic progression studies
suggested that Lp(a) was no longer a risk factor
when LDL-C was controlled. For this reason, many
clinicians have practiced with the assumption that
when an elevated Lp(a) level is discovered, the most
appropriate course of action was to treat the LDL-C
and not the Lp(a). Recent studies have suggested
that this is a false assumption, and that elevated
Lp(a) remains a risk factor even in patients who
achieve LDL-C <70 mg/dl (44,45,58). Furthermore,
the concept of diminishing returns is now apparent
in outcomes trials of LDL-C lowering, in which the
starting LDL-C is now often <100 mg/dl, but the
absolute risk reduction is small. For example, in
IMPROVE-IT
(Improved
Reduction
of
Outcomes:
Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) (59), after a
median of 6 years of follow-up, the major adverse
cardiac event (MACE) rate was 32.7% in the simva-
statin/ezetimibe group, which achieved LDL-C of
54 mg/dl, and 34.7% in the simvastatin-alone arm,
which achieved LDL-C of 70 mg/dl. Although this
was a laudatory achievement, a 32.7% recurrent hard
MACE rate in the setting of an LDL-C of 54 mg/dl
suggests that LDL-C–directed risk reduction might
not reduce events optimally, even with PCSK9 in-
hibitors. Recent reports from the AIM-HIGH (Athe-

for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention
Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) (44), and LIPID (Long-
Term
Intervention
with Pravastatin
in
Ischaemic
Disease) (58) trials have suggested that a portion of
this “residual risk” is due to highly elevated Lp(a) in
the setting of controlled LDL-C. For example, in
AIM-HIGH, patients who achieved LDL-C levels of
65.2 mg/dl and had Lp(a) >125 nmol/l (w50 mg/dl),
which was $75th percentile of Lp(a) levels, had an
89% higher risk of MACEs compared with those who
had a similar LDL-C level, but low Lp(a). In JUPITER,
patients who achieved LDL-C of 55.0 mg/dl and Lp(a)
>54 nmol/l (w21 mg/dl) had a 71% higher risk of
MACEs. In LIPID, in patients who achieved LDL-C of
w112 mg/dl and Lp(a) >73.7 mg/dl, a 23% increase in
MACEs was present (Figure 8). The overall data
encompassing 13,167 statin-treated patients shows a
weighed hazard ratio of 1.61 in the setting of LDL-C
of 89.1 mg/dl and Lp(a) of 54.9 mg/dl. These data
strongly support the independent role of Lp(a) in
mediating CVD events that may explain some of the
residual risk in patients on statin therapy. It should
also be acknowledged that clinical benefit has not
been seen in cholesterol ester transfer protein in-
hibitor trials, despite a modest 20% to 30% reduction
in Lp(a), along with LDL-C reductions and HDL-C
increases. These data, together with the AIM-HIGH
study,
suggest
that
a
potential
benefit
of
Lp(a)
lowering may not be seen unless >50% mean re-
ductions in Lp(a) can be achieved with no detri-
mental off-target cardiovascular effects.
AREA OF CONTROVERSY VII:
DO STATINS INCREASE Lp(a) LEVELS?
The knowledge on the effect of statins on Lp(a) is
evolving. It has been believed that statins do not
affect Lp(a) levels because the LDLR is thought to
play either no role or a minor role in Lp(a) clearance.
Although definitive data do not currently exist, a
close assessment of published reports has suggested
that statins tend to raise Lp(a) by 10% to 20%,
particularly when the data are evaluated as pre- and
post-statin levels in individual patients rather than
mean levels in groups. For example, in a recent
analysis of 3,896 patients in whom Lp(a) and OxPL-
apoB were measured pre- and post-statin therapy,
including
atorvastatin,
pravastatin,
rosuvastatin,
pitavastatin, and simvastatin/ezetimibe, the mean
patient-level Lp(a) increased by 11% (and up to 50% in
some studies), and OxPL-apoB increased by 24%
(Figure 9) (60). This might also explain why some
patients do not respond well to LDL-C lowering by
statins, because most of their cholesterol is on Lp(a),
rather than LDL particles (61), and Lp(a) can increase
with statin therapy. This should be a clue to physi-
cians that lack of response to statin therapy could be

 due to highly elevated Lp(a). Thus, although statin
therapy results in overall benefit, it is possible that
patients who have increased Lp(a) post-statin therapy
do not obtain the full benefit of the statin. A formal
patient-level meta-analysis that assesses the role of
baseline and on-treatment Lp(a), and the change in
Lp(a) post-statin therapy would be helpful to confirm
the potential change in Lp(a) and its relationship to
CVD outcomes. The mechanism(s) by which statins
raise Lp(a) and OxPL-apoB on Lp(a) are undefined,
and require further investigation.
AREA OF CONTROVERSY VIII:
ARE CURRENT THERAPIES TO LOWER Lp(a)
EFFECTIVE AND HAVE THEY REALLY FAILED
IN CLINICAL TRIALS?
First, it must be
emphasized that there
are no
approved medications to specifically lower Lp(a),
and until the recent trials with the antisense oligo-
nucleotides
(ASOs),
there
have
never
been
any
randomized trials of Lp(a) lowering (29,62). The
current pharmaceutical armamentarium of approved
drugs to lower Lp(a) levels in broad populations is
essentially limited to niacin, with PCSK9 inhibitors,
mipomersen, and estrogen in more limited pop-
ulations. When apheresis has been performed to
lower Lp(a), a reduction in cardiovascular risk has
been suggested (63,64). However, a firm conclusion
of
benefit
of
apheresis
or
an
estimation
of
the
magnitude of benefit is hindered by the fact that
studies performed to date have had no simulta-
neous control group; rather, the outcomes of pa-
tients
who
underwent
apheresis
were
compared
with historical controls (63). In addition, most sub-
studies
of
Lp(a)
risk
that
have
evaluated
other
therapies have not recruited patients with elevated
Lp(a) levels, and all are post hoc analyses with
most
patients
having
low
levels;
therefore,
a
proper interpretation is difficult. For example, the
AIM-HIGH trial showed that niacin added to excel-
lent LDL-C control did not change CVD outcomes.
The baseline mean Lp(a) level was w13.5 mg/dl, and
niacin reduced Lp(a) 19% to w11 mg/dl (43), changes
which would be unlikely to result in clinical benefit.
However, niacin also did not reduce the event rate
in the subgroup of patients in the fourth quartile of
Lp(a) (>125 nmol/l or approximately >50 mg/dl),
despite achieving a mean Lp(a) reduction of 39%.
However,
this
analysis
was
underpowered,
with
only w700 patients and an event rate of w16%.
Estrogen with progestin lowered Lp(a) by w15% to
20%
in
HERS
(Heart
and
Estrogen/Progestin
Replacement Study) and, in a post hoc analysis,
post-menopausal women with elevated Lp(a) in the
fourth quartile (55
to 236 mg/dl) had the
most
benefit (65), but this is not generally an option in
women at risk of atherothrombosis. Mipomersen
and PCSK9 inhibitors may reduce Lp(a) by 20% to
30%,
but
are
currently
only
indicated

Thus,
it
can
be
concluded that the Lp(a) hypothesis has not been
tested with any currently available therapy.
AREA OF CONTROVERSY IX: IS Lp(a)
PROATHEROGENIC AND PROTHROMBOTIC,
OR ONLY PROATHEROGENIC?
Because of its high homology with plasminogen and
potential for interfering with plasminogen activa-
tion, Lp(a) may not necessarily be prothrombotic a
priori, but may tilt the balance towards thrombosis
due to the potential loss of fibrinolytic activity.
Basic investigations studying plasminogen proper-
ties in vitro have documented loss of plasminogen
activation to plasmin in the presence of apo(a) or
Lp(a) (70). However, a relationship of Lp(a) kringle
repeats or LPA SNPs with elevated Lp(a) levels in
clinical
venous
thrombosis
studies
could not be
shown, but associations with factor V Leiden were
present (71,72). Although further study is needed,
this does suggest that elevated Lp(a) may need
a
second
underlying
propensity
to
propa-
gate thrombus, and that most patients with elevated
Lp(a)
are
at
risk
primarily
for
atherosclerosis.
Interestingly,
in
the
Women’s
Health
Study,
although the overall trial was negative, the one
subgroup
that
benefited
from
aspirin
use
were
women with elevated Lp(a), which suggested risk
could
be
modified
by
antiplatelet
therapy
(73).
Anecdotal evidence exists for use of vitamin K an-
tagonists in patients with recurrent thromboses and
FIGURE 10
Mechanism of ASO Targeted to Apo(a) to Reduce Lp(a) Levels
Because only apo(a) is targeted, the liver can continue to make very low-density lipoprotein and LDL, and export them to the circulation. Antisense oligonucleotide
(ASO) to apo(a) inhibits both alleles of apo(a). Abbreviations as in Figures 1 and 3.

 high Lp(a), but formal studies have not been re-
ported. To test the fibrinolysis side of the hypothe-
sis, future studies with Lp(a)-lowering agents could
directly assess comprehensive coagulation parame-
ters in patients after lowering of Lp(a).
EMERGING THERAPIES FOR LOWERING Lp(a)
Small molecules and antibodies that inhibit enzyme
activity
and/or
receptors
or
inactivate
proteins,
respectively, are the mainstay of current pharma-
ceuticals. Because Lp(a) has no enzyme activity, and
the
circulating
mass
levels
are
relatively
high,
neither of these approaches may reduce Lp(a) levels.
Because apo(a) is synthesized by hepatocytes, ther-
apies directed at the hepatocyte are likely to be most
efficacious. In this regard, Figure 10 demonstrates
the mechanism of ASOs in inhibiting apo(a) synthe-
sis, and thus, Lp(a) secretion. Liver-targeted ASOs
are injected subcutaneously, bind to plasma pro-
teins, and enter the liver, where they accumulate
intracellularly. They then bind to their target mRNA
mainly in the nucleus but also in cytoplasm if mRNA
is present in this compartment. Once a double-
stranded complex is formed, ribonuclease H1 then
cleaves the sense strand to prevent protein synthe-
sis, but the antisense strand (i.e., the ASO) can then
bind to additional mRNA targets (74). In the case of
ASO to apo(a), the hepatocytes can continue to
synthesize LDL particles and export them; therefore,
steatosis should not occur, but both apo(a) alleles
will be inhibited, Lp(a) assembly prevented, and
plasma Lp(a) levels reduced.
Initial studies suggested that mipomersen, an ASO
that inhibited apoB mRNA, could lower Lp(a) and
OxPL-apoB in transgenic Lp(a) (75). Interestingly, the
mechanism was a marked reduction of apoB produc-
tion, such that apoB was limiting Lp(a) assembly.
Mipomersen did not affect production of apo(a),
which continued to be secreted into the circulation as
“free” apo(a). These preclinical findings were subse-
quently confirmed in 4 randomized trials of LDL-C
lowering, with mipomersen showing a 25% reduc-
tion in Lp(a) (76). This observation confirmed that
lowering Lp(a) could be achieved with ASOs, and
subsequently, it was reported that an ASO specific to
apo(a) reduced circulating apo(a) by 86% without
affecting
apoB
in
apo(a)
transgenic
mice
(77).
Recently, optimized ASOs to apo(a) have been re-
ported for human trials (78), and 3 randomized,
controlled
trials
(29,62)
have
reported
dose-
dependent reductions in mean Lp(a) lowering of
>80%. In addition, a significant reduction was noted
in proinflammatory OxPL and in the inflammatory
effects of monocytes, which are cells that initiate
and accelerate CVD, as well as plasma LDL-C (62).
A
subsequent
advance
in
potency
of
ASOs
was
made
with
IONIS-APO(a)-LRx,
which
contains
an
N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNac3)�conjugated mole-
cule designed to be highly and selectively taken up
by hepatocytes, with mean reductions of 66% to 92%
and up to 99% reduction of Lp(a) in some patients
(Figure 11), together with a reduction in OxPL.
CONCLUSIONS
The Central Illustration depicts the current thresholds
for what is considered Lp(a)-driven risk, and the
effects of approved and emerging therapies. Lp(a)
levels <30 mg/dl are considered optimal, with negli-
gible Lp(a)-mediated risk. Lp(a) levels <50 mg/dl are
recommended by the EAS as optimal, and Lp(a) levels
>60 mg/dl are used as a cutoff for the reimbursement
of apheresis in Germany and the United Kingdom. In a
theoretical patient with a Lp(a) level of 150 mg/dl, use
of statins tends to increase Lp(a) by 10% to 20%. In
contrast, use of niacin, PCSK9 inhibitors, cholesterol

The effect of various therapies on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in a hypothetical patient with Lp(a) of 150 mg/dl, which is >98th percentile for Lp(a)
levels. Statins tend to increase the level by 10% to 20%, to 165 to 180 mg/dl. Niacin, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-type 9 (PCSK9)
antibodies, cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors (CETPi), and mipomersen decrease levels by 20% to 30%, to 105 to 120 mg/dl.
Apheresis results in a time-averaged reduction of 30% to 35%, reducing levels to 98 to 105 mg/dl. Antisense oligonucleotides reduce Lp(a)
by 80% to 99%, reaching levels of 1.5 to 30 mg/dl. CAVS ¼ calcific aortic valve stenosis; CVD ¼ cardiovascular disease; EAS ¼ European

 ester transfer protein inhibitors, and mipomersen
leads to a 20% to 30% reduction. Similarly, apheresis
leads to a time-averaged reduction of 30% to 35%. Use
of ASO, which may reduce Lp(a) >80% and up to 99%,
may reach levels in which the risk due to Lp(a) is quite
low in most patients. Such potent and specific thera-
pies are currently being developed clinically in pa-
tients with elevated Lp(a), and will be able to finally
test the hypothesis that pharmacologically reducing
genetically elevated Lp(a) levels may reduce the risk
of CVD and CAVS in the setting of what is considered
optimal medical therapy at present.
