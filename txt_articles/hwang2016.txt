IMPORTANCE Many investigational drugs fail in late-stage clinical development. A better
understanding of why investigational drugs fail can inform clinical practice, regulatory
decisions, and future research.
OBJECTIVE To assess factors associated with regulatory approval or reasons for failure of
investigational therapeutics in phase 3 or pivotal trials and rates of publication of trial results.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using public sources and commercial databases, we
identified investigational therapeutics that entered pivotal trials between 1998 and 2008,
with follow-up through 2015. Agents were classified by therapeutic area, orphan designation
status, fast track designation, novelty of biological pathway, company size, and as a
pharmacologic or biologic product.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES For each product, we identified reasons for failure (efficacy,
safety, commercial) and assessed the rates of publication of trial results. We used
multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate factors associated with regulatory
approval.
RESULTS Among 640 novel therapeutics, 344 (54%) failed in clinical development, 230
(36%) were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and 66 (10%) were
approved in other countries but not by the FDA. Most products failed due to inadequate
efficacy (n = 195; 57%), while 59 (17%) failed because of safety concerns and 74 (22%) failed
due to commercial reasons. The pivotal trial results were published in peer-reviewed journals
for 138 of the 344 (40%) failed agents. Of 74 trials for agents that failed for commercial
reasons, only 6 (8.1%) were published. In analyses adjusted for therapeutic area, agent type,
firm size, orphan designation, fast-track status, trial year, and novelty of biological pathway,
orphan-designated drugs were significantly more likely than nonorphan drugs to be
approved (46% vs 34%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.7). Cancer drugs (27%
vs 39%; aOR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9) and agents sponsored by small and medium-size
companies (28% vs 42%; aOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7) were significantly less likely to be
approved.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Roughly half of investigational drugs entering late-stage
clinical development fail during or after pivotal clinical trials, primarily because of concerns
about safety, efficacy, or both. Results for the majority of studies of investigational drugs that
fail are not published in peer-reviewed journals.

P
hase 3 clinical trials provide the highest level of evi-
dence that an experimental treatment is safe and effi-
cacious. Although these trials, which typically involve
large numbers of patients, require substantial investment on
the part of participants, investigators, and sponsors, many ex-
perimental drugs tested at this stage fail.1 For example, re-
cently, several therapies that demonstrated promise in ani-
mal and early testing have failed in larger studies to show
clinical benefit, while increasing the risk of serious adverse
events and death among participants.2-4
It is difficult to derive lessons from the experiences of un-
successful experimental drugs. Negative clinical trial find-
ings and the reasons for discontinuing the development of in-
vestigationalproducts,includinglackofapprovalbyregulators,
are often not disclosed.5 Trial data are often not reported pub-
licly in a timely manner and may be worse for unapproved
drugs.6 As a result, there are limited systematic data on why
and how frequently novel agents fail in late-stage develop-
ment. Previous studies have found that most new drug appli-
cations not approved by the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) were reported to have efficacy deficiencies, safety
deficiencies, or both. However, these studies did not assess the
reasons for failure of drugs that did not reach regulatory
filing or were not reviewed by the FDA.7,8
Phase 3 trials, even when the agent being tested does not
demonstrate efficacy or safety, generate valuable information.
Understanding the reasons for development failures can in-
form clinical practice, regulatory decisions, and future re-
search.Wesoughttoidentifyreasonsthatinvestigationalthera-
peutics fail in late-stage clinical development, the rate of trial

Methods
Data Sources
We constructed a data set of novel drugs and biologics from 2
commercial databases: Pharmaprojects (Informa plc; Lon-
don, England) and AdisInsight (Springer; Berlin, Germany).
These databases, which are the 2 most widely used by indus-
tryandregulators,trackthedevelopmentofproductsfrompre-
clinical research to marketing using public and proprietary
sources,aswellasdirectcommunicationwithcompanies.They
areassembledintolongitudinaldevelopmenttimelinesforeach
product in the database and updated in real-time. Data from
these registries have been used in prior studies of pharmaceu-
tical research and development.9-12
We obtained information about regulatory approvals and
orphan drug status determinations from public databases
maintainedbytheFDA;EuropeanMedicinesAgency(EMA)and
member states of the European Union, European Economic
Area, and Switzerland; and national regulators in Japan,
Canada, and Australia. As for a previous study,13 for discon-
tinuedproducts,wemanuallyreviewedregulatoryfilings,mar-

public and commercial sources to ascertain the basis for de-
velopment failure as well as regulatory pathway (eTable 1 in
the Supplement). We obtained company financial informa-
tion from McGraw Hill Financial and Bloomberg. All data were
initially downloaded on June 28, 2013, and updated through
December 31, 2015.
Data Extraction
We identified all new drugs, therapeutic biologics, and vac-
cines that entered phase 3 or other pivotal testing between
January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2008, with follow-up
throughDecember31,2015.Weexcludednontherapeuticprod-
ucts, such as diagnostic tests, as well as blood and blood com-
ponent products. This study period was chosen to allow suf-
ficienttimefortrialcompletion(typically2-5years),regulatory
review (up to 1 year), and publication of trial results, resulting
in a total of up to 7 years or more from the start of a phase 3
trial to final approval or discontinuation). We focused on the
lead (or first) indication for which the agent was reported to
beindevelopmentbyPharmaprojects.Forallidentifiedagents,
weextractedpivotaltrialandapprovaldates(ifapplicable)from
the development histories. A pivotal trial is a clinical study de-
signed to provide adequate data on efficacy and safety to serve
as the basis for regulatory approval of the agent for the pro-
posed indication.14 These studies are typically phase 3 trials,
but can also be phase 2 trials (representing approximately 5%
of products in our study).
We also coded the indication, therapeutic area, World
Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
code, agent type (pharmacologic or biologic), mechanism of
action (or putative biological properties if mechanism was un-
known), originator (first firm associated with the drug) and
sponsor (firm[s] conducting the phase 3 trial) name, orphan
designation status (a pathway used by the FDA and European
Medicines Agency [EMA] for agents intended to treat rare dis-
eases), and fast track designation by FDA or EMA (designated
by the EMA as “accelerated assessment”). We defined small
and medium-size companies as those with annual gross rev-
enues less than $1 billion USD at the time of the pivotal trial.
We then assessed whether the drug was directed to a novel
pathway, defined as a target or biological pathway for which
the FDA had not yet approved a therapeutic agent by the piv-
otaltrialstartyear,consistentwiththedefinitionusedbyFDA15
and others.16-18 Two investigators (B.W. and J.C.L.) indepen-
Key Points
Question Why and how often do experimental drugs fail in phase
3 clinical trials, and how often are trial results published?
Findings Using public sources and commercial databases
covering drugs and biologics that started trials between 1998 and
2008, 54% of agents carried into pivotal trials failed, primarily
owing to inadequate efficacy or safety concerns. Trial results were
published for 40% of these failed agents.
Meaning Although many drugs fail in late-stage trials, the rate of
publication of trial results is poor.

dently assessed novelty (Cohen κ, 0.88), with disagreements
resolved by consensus (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Finally, we matched these data to the lists of approved
drugs and biologics. For each discontinued product, the rea-
sons for failure were identified using the data sources listed
above. We categorized failures by whether they were primar-
ily owing to safety (eg, imbalance of deaths in the pivotal trial
treatmentarm,reportedseriousadverseevents,orothersafety-
related reasons), efficacy (eg, failure to show statistically sig-
nificantbenefitoveracomparator),orcommercialorotherstra-
tegic reasons (eg, company went into bankruptcy and ceased
development). Successful regulatory approval was defined as
approval by the FDA; in sensitivity analyses, we also defined
success as approval in the United States or Europe, and as ap-
provalintheUnitedStates,Europe,Japan,Canada,orAustralia.
European approval was defined as centralized approval by the
EMA; approval through the mutual recognition procedure,
which allows approval in 1 member state to be recognized by
other European Union countries; or approval by Iceland,
Liechtenstein,andNorway,whichareEuropeanEconomicArea
countries, or Switzerland.
We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science for
publications of trial results using the product’
s chemical, ge-
neric, and proprietary names, investigator names, and clini-
caltrialtitle(ifapplicable),updatedthroughDecember31,2015.
Statistical Analysis
We used the Fisher exact test, as appropriate, to conduct pair-
wise comparisons of factors associated with failure of an in-
vestigational agent and the publication of trial results.
Wethenconstructedmultivariablelogisticregressionmod-
els to examine factors associated with successful regulatory
approval. Models included all variables of interest regardless
of statistical significance: therapeutic area, agent type (phar-
macologic vs biologic), originator and sponsor firm type (small
vs large), orphan designation, fast track status, novel path-
way, and an indicator variable for trial start year (to account
for secular trends over time). In sensitivity analyses, we re-
peated our analysis using a continuous time variable instead
of an indicator variable for trial year and using an alternate
threshold of $100 million USD to define small and medium-
size companies.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 12
(StataCorp). Two-tailed P values less than .05 were consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
We examined the status of clinical development and basis for
failure or regulatory approval for 640 novel therapeutic agents
(Table 1): 344 (54%) of the agents failed; 230 (36%) were ap-
proved by the FDA, 49 (8%) were granted regulatory approval
in Europe, Japan, Canada, or Australia, but not the United
States, and 17 (3%) were approved in countries other than the
United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia. The ma-
jority of new agents entered pivotal trials during the study pe-
riod for 3 therapeutic areas: cancer (147 [23%]), cardiovascu-
lar disease (102 [16%]), and infectious diseases (100 [16%]).
Orphan designation and fast track review were granted to 125
agents (20%) and 118 agents (18%), respectively; 359 (56%) of
the agents were categorized as targeting a novel pathway.

Reasons for Failure
Among the 344 unapproved agents, the clinical development
for195(57%)failedforlackofefficacy,for59(17%)duetosafety
concerns, and for 74 (22%) due to commercial or other rea-
sons (Table 2). We were unable to identify the reasons for fail-
ure of 16 (5%) agents.
The failures related to safety included 10 (17%) agents with
testing halted due to an increased risk of death; 18 (31%) as-
sociated with serious adverse effects such as cancer, stroke,
and sepsis; 5 (8%) associated with laboratory test abnormali-
ties; 5 (8%) associated with carcinogenicity or other serious ad-
verseeffectsinlong-termpreclinicalstudies;and21(36%)with
undisclosed safety issues or a requirement for further safety
testing.

Factors Associated With Regulatory Approval
In both unadjusted (Figure) and adjusted (Table 3) analyses,
the factors most strongly associated with likelihood of ap-
proval by the FDA were orphan designation, cancer drugs, and
sponsor size. As compared with nonorphan drugs, orphan
drugs were more likely to gain FDA approval than nonorphan
drugs(unadjustedrates,46%vs34%;adjustedoddsratio[aOR],
2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.7; P < .001). Cancer agents were less likely
togainFDAapprovalthannoncanceragents(27%vs39%;aOR,
0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; P = .02), and agents sponsored by small
and medium-size companies were less likely to gain FDA ap-
proval as compared with those sponsored by large companies
(28% vs 42%; aOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7; P < .001). These
associations remained significant when defining success as
regulatory approval in either the United States or Europe, or
as regulatory approval in the United States or any of Europe,
Japan, Australia, and Canada (Table 3).
In sensitivity analyses, we obtained similar results using
a continuous time variable (eTable 3 in the Supplement) and
using a different threshold (annual gross revenues of less than
$100 million) to define small and medium-size companies
(eTable 4 and eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Trial Results Reporting
The pivotal study results for 138 (40%) of the agents were pub-
lished in peer-reviewed journals (Table 4). Agents that failed
owing to efficacy or safety reasons were more likely than those
that failed for commercial reasons to have published trial re-
sults (Fisher exact P < .001 for the comparison across catego-

ries). Of 74 trials for agents that failed for commercial rea-
sons, only 6 (8.1%) were published. Additional predictors of
publication included development by a large company, car-
diovascular agents, and neurological agents (Fisher exact
P < .001 for all univariable tests).
Discussion
In this study of investigational drugs entering late-stage clini-
cal development between 1998 and 2008 with follow-up
through 2015, we found about half of the experimental medi-
cines failed during or after pivotal clinical trials. Most of these
development failures were attributable to inadequate evi-
dence of efficacy. The testing for a further 1 in 5 products was
halted because of an increased risk of death or other poten-
tially serious harms to patients.
Although many experimental treatments may be pub-
licly described in superlatives during their development pro-
cess, true breakthroughs are rare.19,20 In several cases, the
phase 3 studies reversed the encouraging results of earlier in-
vestigations. For example, elesclomol, a first-in-class com-
pound believed to induce oxidative stress, combined with pa-
clitaxel showed a statistically significant improvement in
progression-free survival compared with paclitaxel alone in a
phase2trialofpatientswithadvancedmetastaticmelanoma.21
Yet, in a larger phase 3 trial, the elesclomol combination did
not significantly improve progression-free survival, and the
trialwashaltedwhenmoredeathsinthecombinationarmwere
observed.22
We found that certain categories of products were more
likely to succeed. Orphan-designated drugs, for example, were
highly likely to be approved after late-stage trials. Previous
studieshaveshownthatorphandrugsaremorelikelythannon-
orphan drugs to be approved based on small, single-arm trials,
which may be explained by the difficulty of enrolling pa-
tients with rare diseases.23,24 However, such trial designs may
increase the risk of false-positive results, pointing to the need
for timely completion of rigorous postapproval studies.25 Suc-
cess rates also varied by therapeutic area. For example, our re-
sults are consistent with prior work9 showing that infectious
diseasetrialshavehighsuccessrates.Thisfindingsuggeststhat
recent policy efforts to accelerate the approval of infectious
disease agents may be better targeted at increasing the num-
ber of novel compounds reaching clinical trials, rather than al-
tering the standards for success in such trials.
Despite the importance of the evidence generated by piv-
otaltrialsandthelargenumbersofpatientsinvolved,wefound
thatthestudyresultsforlessthanhalfoftheproductsthatfailed
were eventually published, which is substantially lower than
the previously reported trial publication rates of 76% to 86%
for approved drugs.26-28 This gap in publication rates has im-
portantethicalimplications.First,manypatientsinclinicaltrials
agree to participate to advance scientific understanding of dis-
ease. Researchers and sponsors have a responsibility to en-
sure that the contributions of these patients are honored, even
if the development is discontinued, through timely sharing of
results in the published literature, where the findings and in-
sights from the trials are accessible to other patients, research-
ers, and clinicians. Second, negative results can inform clini-
calpractice:forexample,trialsofanunapproveddrugmayyield
new insights into the safety and pharmacology of other ap-
proved agents in that class or in related drug classes.29,30 Third,
an incomplete publication record can hinder the translational
medicine process.31,32 Without knowledge of safety and effi-
cacy issues found later in the development process, research-
ersmaycontinuetobringforwardinvestigationalagentstoclini-
cal trials that are unlikely to show benefit.33 As a result, future
research subjects might be more likely to be exposed to harms
from toxic or futile treatments.34,35 Such data are also valu-
ablefortherepurposingoffaileddrugsfornewindications,such
as thalidomide for treatment of patients with multiple my-
eloma and leprosy.36 Given the increasing cost of clinical trials,
lack of information sharing wastes resources and diverts at-
tention from more productive areas of research. To that end,
the National Institutes of Health recently proposed a regula-
tion to require that the results of trials for unapproved drugs
be deposited in the public ClinicalTrials.gov repository.37,38 If
it were to take effect, this rule may promote public accessibil-
ity of knowledge gained from clinical trials, even if the results
are not yet published in the medical literature.
Ourstudyhasseverallimitations.First,wefocusedoncom-
pounds that failed in late-stage development, and our results
may not be generalizable to products discontinued in early-
stage testing. Second, although we relied on both public and
commercial sources, it is possible that we did not capture all

of the reasons for failure or all of the products under develop-
ment. A prior study found that sponsors often do not ad-
equately disclose the precise reasons why drugs are not ap-
proved, and complete response letters issued by the FDA for
unapproved products were not available.5 However, we were
abletoidentifybroadlystatedreasonsforfailureformostprod-

vious studies of failures of products in phase 3 trials that oc-
curred from 2007 to 201239 and of products developed by large
pharmaceutical companies, which have found that the ma-
jority of failures are due to inadequate efficacy.40,41 In addi-
tion, we used 2 comprehensive databases; our data set of 640
drugs over a 10-year period is larger than that in a FDA study7
that reported 302 new drug applications submitted between
2000 and 2012. Third, although we chose our study period to
allow sufficient follow-up time for the products in our
cohort, it is possible that some drugs that are currently unap-
proved may gain approval, and more trial results may be pub-
lished. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility of unmea-
sured confounders, such as other types of regulatory pathways
used to expedite approval, which were unavailable in our data
sources. These limitations, however, are unlikely to substan-

tially affect our conclusions that many investigational prod-
ucts are discontinued in late-stage development owing to con-
cerns about efficacy and safety and that trial results for
unapproved drugs frequently remain unpublished.
Conclusions
Recent policymaking aimed at stimulating pharmaceutical in-
novation has focused on allowing drugs to be approved on the
basis of smaller data sets.42 Some commentators have pro-
posed waiving the need for phase 3 testing, although others
have responded that approval before rigorous study could
worsen health outcomes by leading to widespread use of toxic
or ineffective drugs that would have otherwise been shown to
have failed.43-45 As many investigational products fail in late-
stage development because of inadequate efficacy or safety,
our findings suggest that additional efforts to promote drug
development should be directed at improving the validity of
preclinical models for use in translational research and in-
creasingthenumberofinnovativeproductsenteringtrials.The
timely publication of trial results for all investigational agents,
including those that fail in late-stage clinical development, is
imperative.
