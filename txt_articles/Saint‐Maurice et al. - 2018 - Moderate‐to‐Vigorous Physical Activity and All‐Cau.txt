 Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity and All-Cause Mortality: Do
Bouts Matter?
Pedro F. Saint-Maurice, PhD; Richard P. Troiano, PhD; Charles E. Matthews, PhD; William E. Kraus, MD
Background-—The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults accumulate moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity (MVPA) in bouts of ≥10 minutes for substantial health benefits. To what extent the same amount of MVPA
accumulated in bouts versus sporadically reduces mortality risk remains unclear.
Methods and Results-—We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2006 and death
records available through 2011 (follow-up period of �6.6 years; 700 deaths) to examine the associations between objectively
measured physical activity accumulated with and without a bout criteria and all-cause mortality in a representative sample of US
adults 40 years and older (n=4840). Physical activity data were processed to generate minutes per day of total and bouted MVPA.
Bouted MVPA was defined as MVPA accumulated in bouts of a minimum duration of either 5 or 10 minutes allowing for 1- to 2-
minute interruptions. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality associated with total and bouted MVPA were similar and ranged from
0.24 for the third quartile of total to 0.44 for the second quartile of 10-minute bouts. The examination of jointly classified quartiles
of total MVPA and tertiles of proportion of bouted activity revealed that greater amounts of bouted MVPA did not result in
additional risk reductions for mortality.
Conclusions-—These results provide evidence that mortality risk reductions associated with MVPA are independent of how activity
is accumulated and can impact the development of physical activity guidelines and inform clinical practice. (J Am Heart Assoc.

T
he 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans
recommends that adults accumulate at least 150 min/
wk of moderate or 75 min/wk of vigorous-intensity physical
activity for substantial health benefits.1 The guidelines also
direct that activity be performed in bouts of at least 10
minutes. The 10-minute bout criterion originated in 1995 and
was intended to provide flexibility in achieving the recom-
mended dose.2 This messaging shift emphasized the impor-
tance of accumulating a total volume of moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity (MVPA) and has remained a central feature of
guidelines as they evolved. Surprisingly, evidence supporting
a minimum bout of 10 minutes is limited.3 Recent studies
comparing MVPA accumulated in bouts to total minutes
regardless of bouts suggest that bouts provide no additional
benefit regarding metabolic syndrome, waist circumference,
and body mass index.4–8 However, these studies are limited
to cross-sectional designs that evaluated risk factors, making
it difficult to understand the temporal sequence for the
observed associations or the influence of MVPA bouts on end
points, such as all-cause mortality. Thus, whether only bouts
or total accumulated MVPA is more beneficial to mortality
remains uncertain.

Nutrition Examination Survey) 2003–2006 cycles. NHANES
samples noninstitutionalized US civilians using a multistage
probability sampling design that considers geographical area
and minority representation. Sample weights are generated to
create nationally representative estimates for the US popu-
lation and subgroups defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

for more details on NHANES sampling procedures. NHANES
collects data on various health and behavior indicators,
including physical activity and self-reported diagnosis of
prevalent health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, coronary
artery disease, stroke, and cancer. These data were merged
with mortality records from the National Death Index, available
through December 2011. The National Center for Health
Statistics links mortality records available through the National
Death Index with individuals in the respective NHANES
database using various individual information such as social
security number, first name, month of birth, sex, race, and
others.9 The matching process/linkage provides vital status for
each individual that has been shown to accurately identify 87%
to 97% of the true death records and is fairly accurate across
race/ethnicities.10–12 Our study used linked mortality NHANES
data released to the public by the National Center for Health
Statistics and restricted the analytical sample to adults aged
40 years and older with complete data on all variables of
interest (N=4840 respondents). Details of this cohort have
been reported elsewhere.13 The NHANES study was reviewed
and approved by the National Center for Health Statistics
Research Ethics Review Board and all participants provided
signed consent for participation.
Assessment of Physical Activity
Physical activity was measured with a waist-worn uniaxial
accelerometer (AM-7164; ActiGraph) for up to 7 days using a
standardized protocol.14 Data were initially screened for non-
wear time using a previously developed algorithm for NHANES
accelerometer data.14 Days with fewer than 10 hours of wear
time were excluded and participants with at least 1 valid day of
accelerometer data were included in the analysis. A threshold of
760 counts per minute defined MVPA. This threshold was
defined to capture a broader range of lifestyle and ambulatory
activities and has been demonstrated to provide accurate
estimates of time spent in MVPA.15–17 Minutes of activity were
computedfor3measuresofMVPA:totalwithnoboutrestriction,
accumulated in ≥5-minute bouts, and accumulated in ≥10-
minute bouts. MVPA accumulated in bouts of 5 or 10 minutes
allowed for 1 and 2 minutes, respectively, of activity counts
<760 counts per minute to accommodate real-life activity
patterns (eg, stopping at a crosswalk while walking).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted with Cox proportional hazard
models using established covariates of the physical activity–
mortality
association13:
age
(years),
sex,
race-ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, other),
education (less than high school, high school diploma, high
school or more), alcohol consumption (never, former, current),
smoking status (never, former, current), body mass index
(<25, 25–29.9, ≥30 kg/m2), and self-reported diagnosis (yes/
no) of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, stroke,
cancer, and mobility limitation.
First, we examined mortality associations by quartiles for
each of the 3 MVPA measures: total, ≥5-minute, and ≥10-
minute bouts, not accounting for differences in activity
volume. Total MVPA was similar across the 3 measures and
strongly correlated (r=0.7–0.9) (Table S1), suggesting that the
measures were not independent and that individuals who
accumulated the most total MVPA also accumulated high
amounts of MVPA in 5- or 10-minute bouts.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This study examines whether moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity needs to be accumulated in bouts to provide
mortality benefits.
• Accelerometer-measured physical activity data collected in
2003–2006 from a representative sample of US adults
(n=4840) were classified as being accumulated sporadically
or in bouts and linked to mortality records available through
2011.
• Sporadic and bouted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
was similarly and strongly associated with mortality risk.
• Mortality risk reductions associated with moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity are independent of how activity
is accumulated.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• This finding can inform future physical activity guidelines
and guide clinical practice when advising individuals about
the benefits of physical activity.
• The key message based on the results presented is that
total physical activity (ie, of any bout duration) provides
important health benefits.
• Practitioners can promote either long single or multiple
shorter bouts of activity in advising adults how to progress
toward
150 min/wk
of
moderate-to-vigorous
physical
activity.
• This flexibility may be particularly valuable for individuals
who are among the least active and likely at greater risk for
developing chronic conditions.

 To account for the dependence between total and bouted
activity, we jointly classified quartiles of total MVPA by bouted
activity, based on tertiles of the proportion of total MVPA
accumulated in bouts of ≥5 or ≥10 minutes. This resulted in
12 categories of total MVPA and relative contribution of
bouted MVPA. Many participants, particularly in the lower
quartiles of total MVPA, had 0 bouts of ≥10 minutes. This led
to unstable estimates, so analyses focused on bouts of
≥5 minutes. In these analyses, evidence of greater benefit for
bouted activity would be demonstrated by lower hazard ratios
(HRs) as contribution of bouts to total MVPA increased. To
further describe the relationship between these exposures we
plotted the risk estimates for each of the 12 categories
against total MVPA. The assumption of proportional hazards
was tested and held true for our MVPA exposure. All analyses
accounted for the complex survey design in NHANES and
were conducted using the SAS version 9.3 (SAS Insistute Inc)
and SUDAAN (RTI International) statistical packages.
Results
Over a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, 700 deaths were
recorded. Participants were 46.7% male and 77.4% non-
Hispanic white, 17.4% had less than a high school education,
21.1% were current smokers, and 62.0% reported drinking
alcohol.
For each of the 3 MVPA measures, greater MVPA was
associated with lower mortality (P trend <0.01; Figure 1). HRs
ranged from 0.24 to 0.44 and were nearly identical for each
measure. For example, risk was similar in the upper quartiles for
total MVPA (HR, 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16–0.45),
5-minute bouts (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17–0.45), and 10-minute
bouts (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.23–0.53) (Table S2). Among the
categories jointly classified by quartiles of total MVPA and
tertiles of bouted MVPA, greater total MVPA was associated
with lower mortality, but greater proportions of bouted MVPA
showed no additional risk reduction (Table). Specifically, within
a given quartile of MVPA, HRs were similar across tertiles of
bout proportion (Table, columns 2–4). For example, in the first
MVPA quartile, higher contributions of bouted activity resulted
in similar HRs for moderate (0.75; 95% CI, 0.60–0.95) and high
amounts of bouted activity (0.77; 95% CI, 0.60–0.99). HRs
across tertiles within each of the remaining quartiles were also
similar. Analyses replicated with bouts of ≥10 minutes were
unstable in the lowest 2 quartiles because >30% of the sample
had no ≥10-minute bouts, but showed the same pattern for
quartiles 3 and 4 (data not shown). To visualize these
relationships, we plotted the HRs for each of the 12 categories
by total MVPA in each category (Figure 2). Overall, greater total
MVPA was associated with lower mortality, reaching a plateau
at about 100 min/d, with no appreciable additional benefit of
greater relative contributions of bouted activity. It was also

uous bouts of activity.
Discussion
This prospective study examined the relative benefits of
bouted
versus
sporadic
MVPA
on
mortality
in
a
representative sample of US adults, using an objective
measure of physical activity. Greater total MVPA was
strongly associated with lower mortality, and bouted activity
conferred little additional benefit. Thus, these results provide
evidence that mortality risk reductions associated with
MVPA are independent of how activity is accumulated.

 edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and
other recommendations.
Several published studies have examined the associations
between physical activity and mortality and were used to
inform the current physical activity guidelines.3 However,
most of these studies relied on data obtained from self-
reports and only a few explored these associations using
device-based measures of physical activity.13,18–23 Even
though the current physical activity guidelines recommend
that activity be accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes, most of
these studies also examined the relative benefits of sporadic
MVPA. The few studies specifically examining the value of
bouted physical activity showed that sporadic versus bouted
activity had similar associations with the metabolic syndrome,
waist circumference, and body mass index.4–8 However, all of
these studies employed cross-sectional designs and examined
intermediate end points. Thus, these studies could not
address the ancillary question of whether sporadic and
bouted activity can provide similar health benefits. In our
study, similar to earlier published NHANES studies, we found
risk reductions for all-cause mortality to range from 60% to
80% across increased amounts of accumulated sporadic
MVPA. However, the key finding of our study was that lowered
risk for all-cause mortality associated with sporadic MVPA
was no different than the lowered risk associated with activity
accumulated in bouts of ≥5 minutes. This finding aligns with
previous studies examining cross-sectional associations of
sporadic versus bouted activity with various health risk
factors; however, it provides new evidence that benefits for
mortality, a robust health end point, are independent of how
activity is accumulated.
Our study is the first to use data from a representative
sample of US adults with device-based estimates of physical
activity to compare the benefits of sporadic with bouted
activity. Our analyses provide a robust estimate of such
benefits but include a few challenges that are worth
mentioning. We found that total and bouted activity were
highly correlated (r=0.7–0.9) and that few individuals in the
United States accumulate activity in bouts of ≥10 minutes
(>30% of the sample had no 10-minute bouts detected).
These preliminary findings shaped our efforts in modeling the
associations among sporadic versus bouted activity and
mortality. To address these challenges, we jointly classified
quartiles of total MVPA at various contributions of bouted
activity of ≥5 minutes. We were unable to fully analyze the
effects of MVPA accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes;
however, where data were available, results for 5- and 10-
minute bouts were similar. We also recognize that a variety
of published cut points are available to define MVPA
intensity.18
NHANES
studies
have
commonly
employed
2020 counts per minute, which is based on ambulatory
calibration, to define MVPA; however, we chose to use a cut
point calibrated to capture a greater variety of lifestyle
activities in addition to ambulatory movement. Our selected
cut point has been extensively evaluated and demonstrated
to provide valuable insights when examining the associations
between
physical
activity
and
mortality.13,15–17,23
We
explored the use of the ambulatory MVPA threshold (ie,
2020 counts per minute) in our study but found limited utility
as the majority of our sample did not accumulate any MVPA
in bouts of 10 minutes with this threshold. We previously
examined the associations of sporadic activity using either
760 or 2020 counts per minute and found similar associ-
ations with mortality (unpublished findings). Thus, we do not
expect our conclusions to be dependent on our choice of the
760 cut point, and consider that the magnitude of our
associations for both sporadic and bouted activity may be
conservative.
Conclusions
Despite the historical notion that physical activity needs to be
performed for a minimum duration to elicit meaningful health
benefits, we provide novel evidence that sporadic and bouted
Figure 2. Distribution of hazard ratios provided in the Table by
total duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for
jointly classified quartiles of total minutes and tertiles of relative
contribution of bouted minutes. For example, 4,1 is equivalent to
combined quartile 4 of total MVPA and tertile 1 (Table) of the
relative contribution of bouted to total minutes. The relative
contribution (%) of bouted MVPA minutes ranged from 3% (bright
yellow) to 81% (dark red). The joint group 4,1 represents
150 minutes in total MVPA and �50% of the total duration was
accumulated in bouts of ≥5 minutes. The remaining 50% was
accumulated in sporadic activity. The grey error bars indicate the
upper and lower 95% confidence intervals for respective hazard
ratios. Hazard ratios are adjusted for age, sex, race-ethnicity,
education, alcohol consumption, smoking status, body mass
index, and self-reported diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, coronary
artery disease, stroke, cancer, and mobility limitation.

 MVPA are similarly associated with substantially reduced
mortality. This finding can inform future physical activity
guidelines and guide clinical practice when advising individ-
uals about the benefits of physical activity. Practitioners can
promote either long single or multiple shorter episodes of
activity in advising adults on how to progress toward
150 min/wk of MVPA. This flexibility may be particularly
valuable for individuals who are among the least active and
likely at greater risk for developing chronic conditions.
