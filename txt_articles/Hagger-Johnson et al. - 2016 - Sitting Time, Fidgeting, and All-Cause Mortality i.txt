 Sitting time, fidgeting and all-cause mortality in the UK Women's Cohort Study 
Abstract 
Introduction: Sedentary behaviours (including sitting) may increase risk of mortality 
independently of physical activity level. Little is known about how fidgeting behaviours 
might modify the association. 
Methods: Data were drawn from the UK Women’s Cohort Study. In 1999/2002, 12,778 
women (age 37 to 78) provided data on average daily sitting time, overall fidgeting 
(irrespective of posture), and a range of relevant covariates including physical activity, diet, 
smoking status and alcohol consumption. Participants were followed for mortality over a 
mean of 12 years. Proportional hazards Cox regression models were used to estimate the 
relative risk of mortality in the high (vs. low) and medium (vs. low) sitting time groups. 
Results: Fidgeting modified the risk associated with sitting time (p value for interaction = 
0.04), leading us to separate groups for analysis. Adjusting for a range of covariates, sitting 
for 7+ hours/day (vs. <5 hours/day) was associated with 30% increased risk of all-cause 
mortality (HR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.02, 1.66) only among women in the low fidgeting group. 
Among women in the high fidgeting group, sitting for 5/6 (vs. <5 hrs/day) was associated 
with decreased risk of mortality (HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.43, 0.91), adjusting for a range of 
covariates. There was no increased risk of mortality from longer sitting time in the middle 
and high fidgeting groups. 
Conclusions: Fidgeting may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality associated with excessive 
sitting time. More detailed and better validated measures of fidgeting should be identified in 
other studies in order to replicate these findings and identity mechanisms, particularly 
measures that distinguish fidgeting in a seated from standing posture.

Introduction

Current physical activity recommendations suggest that adults aged 18 to 64 years old should 
6 
participate in about 150 minutes of moderate activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (or 
7 
some equivalent combination) per week for optimum health.1 Even among adults who meet 
8 
these recommendations and who sleep for eight hours per night, it is possible to spend over 
9 
15 hours a day being sedentary.  
10 
 
11 
 
12 
Sedentary behavior—defined as “as any waking behavior characterized by an energy 
13 
expenditure ≤1.5 METs while in a sitting or reclining posture”2 such as sitting or watching 
14 
television3 has come under increased scrutiny as a risk factor for mortality,2, 4 needing 
15 
independent consideration from low physical activity.4, 5 Sedentary behavior has been shown 
16 
to predict mortality and other health outcomes even in those achieving the WHO 
17 
recommended physical activity levels.2, 5-7 
18 
 
19 
 
20 
A recent meta-analysis of 18 studies (two cross-sectional and 16 prospective) suggested that 
21 
individuals who spent more time being sedentary had a greater likelihood of developing

diabetes and CVD, and death from CVD or all-causes.6 The associations were largely 
1 
independent of physical activity6. Long-term follow-ups considering the effect of sedentary 
2 
behavior on mortality are still relatively rare. Breaks in sitting time have been shown to 
3 
improve metabolic biomarkers,8, 9 but no study has examined whether fidgeting might modify 
4 
an association between sitting time and all-cause mortality, the starting point for our 
5 
investigation. Fidgeting is typically defined as involving small movements, especially of the 
6 
hands and feet, often through nervousness, restlessness or impatience.10 These movements 
7 
can occur while seated or standing and might involve low levels of energy expenditure, but 
8 
could bring benefits to those who are sedentary for long periods of time.

The current study examined the association between sitting time and mortality in almost 
12 
13,000 women in the UK Women’s Cohort Study with an average of 12 years follow-up. Our 
13 
aim was to determine if fidgeting modified the association between longer sitting times and 
14 
mortality.

Study Sample

4 
Data were drawn from the UK Women’s Cohort Study (UKWCS), a prospective cohort study 
5 
of women in England, Scotland and Wales.11 At recruitment in 1995/98, 61,000 women aged 
6 
35 to 69 who had previously completed a survey from the World Cancer Research Fund were 
7 
invited to complete a food frequency questionnaire (n = 35,372; 58% response rate) and 
8 
provided socio-demographic information. In 1999/2002, 14,245 participants (aged 37 to 78) 
9 
completed a second questionnaire which included questions on health behaviors, chronic 
10 
disease, a 24-hour activity questionnaire, questions about physical activity levels, and 
11 
fidgeting (each presented in that order). Ethical approval for the cohort was provided by 174 
12 
separate National Health Service (NHS) Committees. End of follow-up for our study was 31st 
13 
December 2013; statistical analysis took place in 2014.

Mortality. Vital status was monitored using the NHS number assigned to each UK citizen. In 
20 
our analysis, mortality was monitored from 1999/2002 (our baseline) to 31st December 2013 
21 
(end of follow-up).

Sitting time at baseline. Participants were asked ‘On an average weekday how is your day 
3 
spent?’ They were then required to report the number of hours and/or minutes in a 24 hour 
4 
day spent doing the nine activities: (Sleeping/Sitting/Light activities/Standing/Household 
5 
chores/Lifting heavy objects/Light exercise/Moderate exercise/Strenuous) exercise, which 
6 
included sitting. Participants were also asked ‘On an average weekend day how is your day 
7 
spent?’ with the same response options. Answers for ‘Sitting’ were combined to give a mean 
8 
average sitting time per day [(5*weekday + 2*weekend hours)/7]. The distribution was 
9 
divided into three sitting time groups: low (<5 hours/day), medium (5 or 6 hours/day) and 
10 
high (7 or more hours/day). 
11 
 
12 
 
13 
Fidgeting behavior at baseline. Participants were asked, ‘On a scale from 1-10 please 
14 
indicate how much of your time you spend fidgeting. 1 would represent “no fidgeting at all” 
15 
and 10 would represent “Constant fidgeting”’. The distribution was divided three fidgeting 
16 
groups: low (1 or 2), middle (3 or 4), or high (5 to 10).  
17 
 
18 
 
19 
Covariates recorded at baseline. To record physical activity level, participants were asked, 
20 
‘Which of the following four activity classes best describes your present weekly activity?’ 
21 
Response options were ‘No weekly physical activity (1)’, ‘Only light/moderate physical 
22 
activity in most weeks (2)’, ‘Vigorous activity for at least 20 minutes once or twice a week 
23 
 5 
 
5 
 
(vigorous activity causes shortness of breath, rapid heart rate and sweating) (3)’, ‘Vigorous 
1 
activity at least 20 minutes three or more times per week (4)’. Sleep time was recorded as one 
2 
of the nine activities described above. Participants reported the number of hours they slept on 
3 
an average weekday and weekend, combined to give a mean sleeping time per day 
4 
[(5*weekday + 2*weekend hours)/7]. Participants were asked, ‘In a typical week, how much 
5 
do you drink?’ Participants selected the relevant type of alcohol and reported amount 
6 
consumed as ‘Beer or cider (half pints each week)’, ‘Wine (glasses each week)’, 
7 
‘Sherry/Fortified Wines (glasses each week)’, ‘Spirits (glasses [singles] each week)’. 
8 
Participants were also asked, ‘If less than once per week, then...In a typical month how much 
9 
do you drink?’ with the same response options. Responses to either question were used to 
10 
estimate units of alcohol consumed per week (1 UK unit = 8g ethanol), with those consuming 
11 
15 units or more per week classified as heavy drinkers, 1-14 units as moderate, and those 
12 
reporting 0 units per week were coded as non-drinkers.12 Self-reported smoking status was 
13 
used to classify participants into current, ex, or never-smokers. Average daily fruit/vegetable 
14 
consumption was calculated using responses to two questions: ‘How many servings of 
15 
vegetables or dishes containing vegetables (excluding potatoes) do you usually eat in an 
16 
average week?’ and ‘How many servings of fruit or dishes containing fruit do you usually eat 
17 
in an average week?’ Participants were asked, ‘Has a doctor ever told you that you have, or 
18 
have had, any of the following conditions?’ Chronic disease was defined as any ‘Yes’ 
19 
response to the following: ‘Heart attack, coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction’, 
20 
‘Angina’, ‘Stroke,’ ‘Diabetes’ or ‘Cancer’. To record height and weight, participants were 
21 
asked, ‘Approximately how much do you weight at present?’ (stones and pounds or 
22 
kilograms) and ‘What is your present height?’ (feet and inches or centimetres). Responses 
23 
were converted into kilograms and centimetres then were converted into Body Mass Index 
24 
(BMI) categories using the standard formula and World Health Organisation criteria:13 BMI 
25 
 6 
 
6 
 
< 18.5 (underweight), BMI 18.5-24.99 (healthy weight), BMI 25-29.99 (overweight), BMI 
1 
>=30 (obese). 
2 
 
3 
 
4 
Covariates recorded at recruitment. Participants reported any educational qualifications 
5 
(None, CSE, GCE O Level, City & Guilds, A Level/Highers, Teaching diploma, HNC, 
6 
Degree) which were grouped into the highest level achieved (none, secondary school, 
7 
university degree). Occupational social class was coded from the participant’s main job title 
8 
(or partner’s if missing) according to the NS-SEC method14 and classified as 
9 
professional/managerial (high), intermediate, or routine/manual (low). Women who reported 
10 
not being in employment because they were retired, were classified as retired (vs. working).

Statistical analysis 
14 
 
15 
 
16 
In descriptive analyses, we evaluated differences in study variables across three sitting time 
17 
groups. Cox regression with proportional hazards was used to evaluate the association 
18 
between sitting time and mortality risk. The assumption of proportional hazards was tested by 
19 
creating time-varying covariates (ln(T)*sitting time groups) where T was the follow-up time 
20 
since exposure measurement. These variables were not significant for either the middle (p = 
21 
0.32) or high (p = 0.88) sitting time groups, showing that the proportional hazards assumption 
22 
was not violated. In preliminary analyses, we tested whether fidgeting modified the 
23 
 7 
 
7 
 
association between sitting time and mortality. A model containing an interaction term 
1 
between sitting time (in hours) and fidgeting groups fitted the data significantly better than a 
2 
model containing only the separate effects for sitting time and fidgeting (p = 0.04) using the 
3 
likelihood ratio test. This led us to separate the analytic sample into three fidgeting groups for 
4 
analysis, to compare the association at different levels of fidgeting (low/medium/high). We 
5 
also evaluated effects of the separate exposures and their joint effect, relative to the 
6 
unexposed group. Analyses for all-cause mortality were conducted first in a minimally 
7 
adjusted model (adjusting for age) and then in a fully adjusted model (adjusting for age, 
8 
chronic disease, physical activity (none/vigorous twice weekly/vigorous 3+ times weekly vs. 
9 
light/moderate), smoking (current vs. ex/never), alcohol use (heavy/non-drinker vs. 
10 
moderate), daily fruit/vegetable consumption, daily sleep time, educational attainment, 
11 
occupational social class and retirement. We did not adjust for BMI in the main analysis, 
12 
because this may lie on the causal chain between the exposure and mortality. Missing data 
13 
(on covariates only; 1.1%) were replaced using multiple imputation with 10 replications in 
14 
Mplus in order to reduce bias and increase statistical power.15, 16  Sensitivity analyses were 
15 
undertaken to check whether results differed in complete case data, to evaluate possible 
16 
reverse causation, to compare weekday/weekend sitting, to consider separately chronic 
17 
disease categories as covariates, to consider the 24-hour recall measure of physical activity 
18 
also available, and to consider a possible mediating role for Body Mass Index (BMI). 
19 
Analyses were performed in Stata version 13.1 and Mplus version 7.2.

The analytic sample comprised 10,937 women with data on sitting time, fidgeting, covariates 
2 
and vital status (12,778 after multiple imputation). Compared to the study population at 
3 
recruitment, the analytic sample was younger (51.4 vs. 56.9 years) and contained a higher 
4 
proportion of women with degree-level educational attainment (30.8% vs. 12.5%). 
5 
Characteristics of the analytic sample are shown in Table 1 across sitting time groups, and in 
6 
Appendix Table 1 according to vital status (n = 577 deaths). Women in the highest third of 
7 
sitting time tended to be slightly younger, fidgeted less, be current smokers, drink alcohol 
8 
heavily, have a poor diet, sleep for longer, and perform vigorous physical activity <3 times 
9 
per week. The largest proportion of women with no educational qualifications and routine 
10 
occupations, however, was found in the low sitting time group. For reference, characteristics 
11 
of study variables according to fidgeting groups are shown in Appendix Table 2. The high 
12 
fidgeting group tended to be younger, sit for longer, comprised more cigarettes smokers, 
13 
lower levels of physical activity, longer sleep times, higher levels of educational and higher 
14 
social class positions. 
15 
 
16 
 
17 
Associations between sitting time and behavioral measures, before separating fidgeting 
18 
groups, are shown in Appendix Table 3. The effects of the separate exposures and their 
19 
combined effects, relative to the group unexposed to each exposure were: sitting time (HR 
20 
per hour = 1.09, 95% CI 1.04, 1.14), middle vs. low fidgeting group (HR = 1.52, 95% CI 
21 
0.81, 2.84), high vs. low fidgeting group (HR = 1.47, 95% CI 0.87, 2.48), sitting time*middle 
22 
fidgeting group (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.79, 1.00), sitting time*high fidgeting group (HR = 
23 
0.92, 95% CI 0.79, 1.01). The p value for the interaction term (sitting time*fidget group) was 
24 
 9 
 
9 
 
0.04 in the overall model, combining all three groups, showing evidence of significant effect 
1 
modification. These preliminary analyses led us to separate the fidgeting groups for the main 
2 
analysis, which used the larger analytic sample. 
3 
 
4 
 
5 
Results from the Cox regression models are shown in Table 2. Among women with low 
6 
fidgeting scores, sitting for 7+ hours/day (vs. <5 hours/day) was associated with a 43% 
7 
increase in risk of all-cause mortality in age-adjusted models (HR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.14, 1.80). 
8 
After additional adjustment for age, chronic disease, physical activity level, educational 
9 
attainment, occupational social class, smoking, alcohol use, fruit/vegetable consumption, and 
10 
sleep hours, the association was attenuated but remained (HR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.02, 1.66). No 
11 
association was seen between sitting for 7+ hours/day and all-cause mortality in the middle 
12 
(HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.44, 1.29) or high (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.50, 1.15) fidgeting groups. An 
13 
apparent association between sitting 5/6 hours/day and decreased mortality risk was 
14 
significant in the high fidgeting group (HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.43, 0.91) in the fully adjusted 
15 
model. We evaluated the linear association for sitting hours/day in order to evaluate 
16 
consistency of these results. This and other sensitivity analyses, listed in Appendix Table 4, 
17 
suggested that our results were robust.

Discussion 
1 
 
2 
 
3 
Using data from almost 13,000 women in the UK Women’s Cohort Study followed for an 
4 
average of 12 years, we found that fidgeting modified the association between sitting time 
5 
and mortality, independently of a range of covariates including physical activity level. We 
6 
replicated existing findings that longer sitting times were associated with increased risk of 
7 
all-cause mortality,17-23 even among those meeting physical activity recommendations, but 
8 
did not see this association in medium and high fidgeting groups. Fidgeting appeared to 
9 
remove the association between longer sitting times and subsequent mortality. While physical 
10 
activity guidelines are generally well-represented in public health campaigns, there has been 
11 
limited consideration of the potential negative impact of sitting for long periods.24 The 
12 
current study therefore provides important information that while longer time spent sitting 
13 
may have negative consequences, simple behaviors may have the potential to offset this.  
14 
 
15 
 
16 
The current study did not address the potential mechanisms underlying the association 
17 
between sitting time and mortality, as our focus was on exploring whether fidgeting modified 
18 
the association. There have been suggestions that periods of sitting may be associated with 
19 
abnormal glucose metabolism and the metabolic syndrome,4 though full explanatory 
20 
pathways are still lacking. It is, however, necessary to understand sitting time, fidgeting 
21 
movements and the physiological changes associated with these behaviors so that public 
22 
health policies can be developed that provide guidance on the patterns of sitting that are best 
23 
for health and life expectancy.24 For example, it has been suggested that replacing sedentary 
24 
 11 
 
11 
 
behavior with standing or light-intensity physical activity might be beneficial in reducing 
1 
disease risk and mortality at a population level, independently of moderate or vigorous 
2 
physical activity.6 The current results suggest that more complex movements of the hands and 
3 
feet may be important to measure, in addition to level of physical activity. 
4 
 
5 
 
6 
The current study has a number of strengths and limitations. The cohort consists of a large 
7 
sample followed over an extended period of time from midlife, comparable to those 
8 
previously reported.17 The cohort only contains women however, so replications will be 
9 
necessary in samples of men and women. That said, there has been some indication that 
10 
women may be more adversely affected by excessive sitting.4 The current analysis considered 
11 
a number of known confounders of the association between sitting time and mortality. We 
12 
did not adjust for BMI in the main analysis because it is likely to lie on the causal chain 
13 
between sitting and mortality,6, 25 but we did consider the possible mediating role of BMI in 
14 
supplementary analyses and found that this did not attenuate or mediate the association 
15 
found.  
16 
 
17 
 
18 
The limited measure of fidgeting behavior available was an obvious limitation. We suggest it 
19 
may act as a proxy for individuals who make small movements with the feet or hands, 
20 
perhaps serving little practical function, but which bring benefits to those who sit for long 
21 
periods of time. Low intensity physical movements may influence physiological processes 
22 
even when below levels obtained during moderate or vigorous physical activities.26 These 
23 
movements may occur while standing or sitting, but it is the impact of low intensity 
24 
 12 
 
12 
 
movements throughout the day and particularly while seated that is of most interest for 
1 
further study.27 The validity of a single-item measure of fidgeting needs to be demonstrated 
2 
rather than assumed, and so we encourage others to obtain more reliable and validated 
3 
markers of fidgeting. Fidgeting has been of interest to researchers for many years.28 It may be 
4 
necessary to combine information from self-report,29 tri-axial accelerometers,30, 31 
5 
information about actual sitting position, and record specific limb movements, in order to 
6 
obtain the most valid measures for this exposure.31 Single item measures have been used in 
7 
other studies, for example, in five studies in a recent meta-analysis which estimated a 34% 
8 
higher mortality risk for adults sitting 10 h/day.17 The main effect of sitting time was weak, 
9 
although this may simply reflect heterogeneity of effect sizes known to occur across studies.17 
10 
Weak main effects in the presence of effect modification are commonly found for various 
11 
exposures and outcomes. Nonetheless, measurement error in the exposure and the proposed 
12 
effect modifier, is likely to have led us to underestimate the true size of the association. 
13 
Similarly, sitting time was only available as estimates for weekdays and weekend, rather than 
14 
in different settings (such as occupational leisure time, commuting, etc.). When analysed 
15 
separately, the findings for weekday/weekend sitting time were comparable in the low 
16 
fidgeting group, but the overall association appeared to be stronger for weekend sitting than 
17 
for weekday sitting. We were unable to distinguish between types of sitting (e.g. sitting at 
18 
work, sitting at home)5, 32, 33 but suggest that among women still working, weekend sitting 
19 
may comprise more television watching,3, 22 whereas weekday sitting may comprise more 
20 
occupational sitting.23 We were unable to adjust for other confounding factors such as long 
21 
working hours and symptoms of common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression,33 
22 
or longitudinal changes in sitting time and fidgeting. It has been suggested that sitting time 
23 
and particularly television watching picks up other confounding factors,34 such as additional 
24 
 13 
 
13 
 
‘snacking’, alcohol consumption and smoking. We were not able to consider this possibility, 
1 
but did control for the overall level of major health behaviors reported.

The current study represents a first attempt to examine how movements involved in fidgeting 
5 
may protect against the adverse effects of sitting for long periods. Others have recommended 
6 
that researchers revisit sitting time as an exposure in existing datasets.4 We extend this call 
7 
and additionally recommend that more detailed measures of fidgeting are also identified, with 
8 
a view to replicating our study and extending it to elucidate possible mechanisms.

Appendix Table 3
 Appendix Table 4. Sensitivity analyses 
Concern 
Comments 
 Linear association for 
sitting time in hours 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Comparison with 
complete case data 
 In fully adjusted models, a linear association 
between each additional hour of sitting time per 
day and all-cause mortality was only seen in the 
low fidgeting (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.02, 1.12) but 
not the middle (HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.84, 1.04) or 
high (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.90, 1.06) fidgeting 
groups. The association between each additional 
hour of sitting time and all-cause mortality in the 
low fidgeting group was seen even among those 
at the highest level of physical activity (HR = 
1.14, 95% CI 1.00, 1.30; N = 1111).  
 Reran analyses on complete case data, without 
imputation for missing data on covariates. 
Results were not materially different. 
 Reverse causation 
 We excluded deaths within the first five years of 
follow-up. Results were very similar, addressing 
concerns about reverse causation. 
 Differences in weekday 
vs. weekend sitting 
 The association between each additional hour of 
sitting among the low fidgeting group was nearly 
identical for weekday (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.02, 
1.11) and weekend sitting (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 
1.02, 1.12). We observed, however, that weekend 
sitting became significant when all fidgeting 
groups were combined (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.00, 
1.08), whereas weekday sitting (or total sitting; 
reported above) was not (HR = 1.03, 95% CI 
0.99, 1.06). The specificity of the association 
seen for weekend sitting might reflect different 
kinds of sitting behaviour undertaken at 
weekends, such as longer time for television 
watching, or genuinely smaller effect sizes for 
weekday sitting for other reasons. Our overall 
conclusions were unchanged. 
 Chronic disease as a single 
category 
 Alternative measure 
available of physical 
activity 
 Replacing chronic disease with an indicator for 
each disease separately did not influence results. 
 We also created an alternative measure of 
physical activity level using 24-hour recall of 
‘Moderate’ and ‘Strenuous’ activities. These data 
were not used in the main analysis because they 
corresponded less well with established physical 
activity guidelines, but allowed us to compare 
results using two different methods. Results were 
Appendix Table 4
 very similar and did not change our conclusions. 
 Body Mass Index as a 
possible mediator 
 Additional adjustment for underweight, 
overweight or obesity (all vs. healthy weight) in 
the subsample of 9,606 women with data 
available on BMI did not attenuate the 
association between sitting time and mortality in 
the low fidgeting group. Similarly, additional 
adjustment for BMI as a continuous variable 
after excluding underweight women had little 
effect on the association. 
 Main effect of sitting (i.e. 
effects in the reference 
category of the effect 
modifier) 
 The association minimally adjusted for age (OR 
= 1.07, 95% CI 1.16, 1.25) was attenuated 
following additional adjustment for covariates 
(OR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.92, 1.15), consistent with 
interpretation of a weak or null main effect.
