 Review
A Review of Energy Drinks and Mental Health,
with a Focus on Stress, Anxiety, and Depression
Gareth Richards and Andrew P. Smith
Background: Concerns have been expressed regarding the potential for caffeinated energy drinks to nega-
tively affect mental health, and particularly so in young consumers at whom they are often targeted. The prod-
ucts are frequently marketed with declarations of increasing mental and physical energy, providing a short-
term boost to mood and performance. Although a certain amount of evidence has accumulated to substantiate
some of these claims, the chronic effects of energy drinks on mental health also need to be addressed.
Methods: To review the relevant literature, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched for all peer-reviewed ar-
ticles published in English that addressed associations between energy drink use and mental health outcomes.
Case reports were also considered, though empirical studies investigating acute mood effects were excluded
as a review of such articles had recently been published. Fifty-six articles were retrieved: 20 of these (along
with eight more identified through other means) were included in the current review, and, because the ma-
jority addressed aspects of stress, anxiety, and depression, particular focus was placed on these outcomes.
Results: Though a number of null findings (and one negative relationship) were observed, the majority of
studies examined reported positive associations between energy drink consumption and symptoms of men-
tal health problems.
Conclusions: Though the findings imply that energy drink use may increase the risk of undesirable mental
health outcomes, the majority of research examined utilized cross-sectional designs. In most cases, it was
therefore not possible to determine causation or direction of effect. For this reason, longitudinal and inter-
vention studies are required to increase our understanding of the nature of the relationships observed.
Introduction
E
nergy drinks (sometimes referred to as ‘‘stimulant
drinks’’1) are caffeinated soft drinks that claim to
boost performance and endurance.2 They should not be
confused with sports drinks, which are instead marketed
to rehydrate and replace electrolytes lost through exer-
cise.3 Although highly caffeinated soft drinks appeared
in Europe and Asia in the 1960s,4 energy drinks as we
know them initially became available to the public
with the introduction of Red Bull� to Austria in 1987,
and subsequently to North America in 1997. The energy
drinks industry has since grown exponentially, becoming
a multibillion dollar market.5 Considering that the con-
sumption of such products has been associated with a
number of very serious health complaints,6 it is consid-
ered necessary to develop a better understanding of
their effects in the interests of public health.
Concern has been expressed due to the caffeine con-
tent of energy drinks (reportedly sometimes as high as
505 mg per serving4) having the potential to cause intoxi-
cation.6 In addition, such products often contain numerous
other substances, such as taurine, l-carnitine, glucurono-
lactone, B-vitamins, ginseng, and guarana
´. Some additives
(e.g., guarana
´, kola nut, yerba mate
´, cocoa) may also in-
crease overall caffeine content unbeknownst to the con-
sumer, because in some countries, manufacturers are not
required to list that which is attributable to herbal supple-
ments in the nutritional information.6 It is also concerning
that these additional substances are often under-studied
and unregulated, and that interactions between them (as
well as potentially with prescription drugs) are not yet

 fully understood.6 Furthermore, as these additives vary
considerably both in presence and in concentration be-
tween products, a general problem with research in the
area is that it can be difficult to compare like for like.
Caffeine and mental health
It is important to consider relationships between men-
tal health and caffeine use, as the substance appears to be
the main active ingredient in energy drinks.7
Although caffeine consumption is moderately associated
with a number of psychiatric disorders, the relationships ap-
pear not to be causal,8 and discrepancies in the literature are
common.9 Some studies have observed positive effects: for
example, low doses have been shown to elevate mood.10
Evidence suggests, however, that such outcomes likely de-
pend on the dosage consumed; Kaplan et al.,11 for instance,
reported that 250mg increased elation, whereas 500mg in-
creased irritability. Acute effects may also vary between
studies depending on whether or not the research partici-
pants in question were tested in a state of caffeine with-
drawal. Further to this, baseline characteristics of caffeine
consumers are likely to differ from nonconsumers. For in-
stance, when investigating daily caffeine consumption in
psychology students, Gilliland and Andress12 reported
that trait anxiety and depression were higher in moderate
and high consumers compared to abstainers.
Considering the idea that energy drink use may cause
behavioral problems13 and negatively impact on mental
health and well-being, it is concerning to find that the prod-
ucts are often aggressively marketed at young people.4
Children aged between 12 and 17 are among the fastest
growing population of caffeine users,14 with 30–50% of
adolescents and young adults being known to consume en-
ergy drinks.6 However, as black markets in junk food are
known to exist in secondary schools, and that they may
be a result of restrictive policies intended to improve the
diets of children,15 banning the sale of energy drinks to mi-
nors could be an overly simplistic and ineffective solution.
Although the media often portrays energy drinks in a
negative light, Suzuki16 reported that nutritional and
tonic drinks (under which label they can be classified17)
comprised 43.1% of complementary and alternative med-
icines used in Japan. Smith and Atroch18 also noted that
drinks containing guarana
´ have been used for medicinal
purposes in Brazil for hundreds of years. Due to such con-
flicting accounts, it is important to consider whether en-
ergy drinks do indeed affect mental health, and if so, are
the effects positive, negative, or variable.
Acute effects of energy drink consumption on mood
Energy drink companies often market their products
with claims of boosting physiological functioning, pro-
viding short-term boosts to mood and performance. A
current review article,17 as well as several more recently
published reports,19–21 suggests that there may be some
efficacy to these claims. For instance, double-blind trials
have shown benefits of energy drinks compared to pla-
cebo in relation to well-being, vitality, and social extro-
vertedness,22 depression and anxiety,21 and in improving
or maintaining mood under fatiguing or cognitively de-
manding tasks.23 However, Scholey and Kennedy24 ob-
served no mood effects in relation to drinks containing
caffeine, glucose, ginseng, and ginkgo biloba. A recent
study by Grasser et al.25 also reported no difference in
perceived stress between energy drinks and water condi-
tions after a stress-inducing mental arithmetic task.
Negative effects have also sometimes been reported.
For instance, Wesnes et al.21 observed that tension/anx-
iety scores (measured using the Profile of Mood States)
increased significantly in the energy drink condition rel-
ative to placebo at 1 h postconsumption (although no
such effect was detected thereafter). Salinero et al.19
also observed increased nervousness, insomnia, and ac-
tiveness when energy drinks were consumed rather
than placebos; each of these effects occurred in females,
but only the effect of insomnia was statistically signifi-
cant in males. However, due to the placebo condition
also containing the same ingredients other than caffeine
(i.e., water, taurine, sodium bicarbonate, l-carnitine,
and maltodextrin), these effects may be attributable to
caffeine rather than to energy drinks per se.
Although beneficial acute mood effects of energy drinks
have been frequently reported in the literature, null findings
and undesirable side effects have also been observed. Fur-
thermore, manufacturers have rarely addressed the poten-
tial long-term effects that consuming the products may
have. For this reason, the current article aims to review
the literature relating to chronic energy drink use and its as-
sociations with mental health outcomes.
Method
PubMed and PsycINFO were searched for English
language articles published between 1990 and 2015,
and the following search terms were used: ‘‘energy
drinks’’ and ‘‘mental health,’’ ‘‘well-being,’’ ‘‘wellbeing,’’
‘‘stress,’’ ‘‘anxiety,’’ ‘‘depression.’’ Excluding duplicates,
56 articles were initially identified (for a flow diagram
of their inclusion/exclusion, Fig. 1). Author GR read
each of the abstracts and acquired and read all articles
deemed potentially relevant. Of these, 20 (along with
eight others identified by reading through reference
lists) were included in the review, with the findings of
case reports being considered separately to those of em-
pirical studies.
Results
Case reports of energy drink consumption
and mental health problems
Initial anecdotal evidence to suggest that energy drink
use can be associated with the occurrence/reoccurrence
50
RICHARDS AND SMITH
 of psychiatric symptoms comes from eight articles pre-
senting case reports (Table 1). Of these, only three
were identified by the initial literature search; the other
five were identified from references made in other arti-
cles. Although some of the case reports relate to phenom-
ena outside the general scope of the current review,
they are included because they provide a useful starting
point from which to examine associations between en-
ergy drink use and mental health. Together, 12 cases
have been described, and links have been made between
the use of energy drinks and the exacerbation/relapse
of symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder,26–28 Clus-
ter B personality disorder,28 and schizophrenia.28–30
Although these cases imply that the excessive consump-
tion of energy drinks may act as a trigger for relapse in
certain vulnerable people with pre-existing mental health
problems, cases have also emerged in which serious psy-
chiatric symptoms have occurred in otherwise healthy in-
dividuals. These reports have linked excessive energy
drink consumption to anxiety,31 severe manic symp-
toms,32 and acute suicidality.33 However, although the
individuals in question described by Sharma32 and
Szpak and Allen33 had no previous psychiatric issues,
family
histories
of
mental
health
problems
were
revealed. The only case in which no such prior sus-
ceptibility emerged was that presented by Berigan.31
However, given the symptomatology and extreme con-
sumption (6–8 8oz cans per day for 4 months), this
case may simply reflect the effects of caffeine toxicity.
This idea is supported by findings from other case stud-
ies, which have reported high caffeine consumption to
be capable of inducing manic symptoms.34,35
Although the case reports presented in this section
cannot prove that a causal relationship exists between en-
ergy drink use and the acute onset of psychiatric prob-
lems, the chronicity of such accounts is compelling.
These reports are also not necessarily indicative of en-
ergy drinks being a problem when used moderately by
the general population. To address this concern, the
next section will present findings from studies investigat-
ing chronic energy drink consumption and mental health.
Empirical studies of chronic energy drink consumption
and mental health outcomes
The literature search conducted for this review identi-
fied 17 articles that examined chronic energy drink usage
in relation to mental health; three further articles were
identified from reference lists. For details of all 20 stud-
ies, Table 2.
Walther et al.36 investigated associations between en-
ergy drink use and well-being in 500 adolescents and
young adults from Austria. The study found a higher pro-
portion of high well-being in those who consumed en-
ergy drinks and alcohol once a week or less, and a
higher proportion of low well-being in those who con-
sumed alcohol and energy drinks twice a week or
more. An issue with this article was that the authors con-
sidered alcohol and energy drinks together, making it im-
possible to determine their individual effects. However,
the results presented make it plausible to believe that fre-
quent energy drink consumption may have been associ-
ated with low well-being. This was similar to the
findings of Richards et al.37: high consumption of a fac-
tor analyzed variable named ‘‘Caffeinated Soft Drinks/
Gum’’ (derived from the consumption of energy drinks,
cola, and chewing gum) was associated with low general
health in a large sample of British secondary school chil-
dren (N = 2030), although the analysis presented did not
isolate the effects of energy drinks themselves.
Wing et al.38 conducted an intervention study to im-
prove sleep knowledge in a large sample (N = 3713) of
secondary school children from Hong Kong. The article
reported improvements in the intervention group relative
to the control regarding sleep knowledge, mental health

What was of interest to the current review was that the
intervention group was significantly less likely to con-
sume energy drinks thrice a week or more compared to
the control. Although it is not possible to tell from the
data reported whether this observation was in any way
associated with the changes in mental health, it is con-
ceivable that it may have been. Furthermore, the study
does provide hope that such interventions might be effec-
tive in reducing energy drink consumption and also in
promoting better sleeping habits and mental health in ad-
olescents. The next three sections will aim to address
whether energy drink use is associated with stress, anxi-
ety, and depression.
Stress.
The studies identified that examined energy
drink use in relation to stress generally reported posi-
tive relationships. Hofmeister et al.39 found higher stress
levels in regular energy drink users (i.e., those who con-
sumed more than one per week) compared to nonregular
users (i.e., those who consumed one or fewer per week)
in two samples of students. However, no differences
were detected between energy drink users (i.e., those
who consumed one or more per month) and nonusers.
Trapp et al.40 measured energy drink consumption in
mL/d, with estimates being based on frequency of con-
sumption in days per month/week, and the amount of
consumption in usual number of cans consumed on a
day in which energy drinks were used. The study found
stress to be positively associated with energy drink use
in a large sample (N = 1062) of young adult Australians.
Although these initial relationships disappeared once
other factors were controlled for, higher stress did remain
associated with consuming ‡100 mL/d or ‡250 mL/d.
Compared to nonusers, consumption of ‡250 mL/d was
associated with higher stress levels in the whole sample
and in males separately. However, no such effect was
observed in females. Furthermore, although males who
consumed ‡100 mL/d reported higher stress levels than
nonconsumers, no such effects were observed in females
or in the sample as a whole.
In a large study (N = 988) of US Army and Marine per-
sonnel stationed in Afghanistan, Toblin et al.41 found
that those who consumed three or more energy drinks
per day were more likely to report sleep disruption due
to stress. However, another study of International Secur-
ity Assistance Force personnel in Afghanistan (Waits
et al.42) found that, out of four energy drinks investi-
gated, the number of servings consumed per week only
increased significantly for one brand between predeploy-
ment and deployment. This effect was also considered
likely to reflect the differential availability of brands be-
tween the United States and Afghanistan, and so may
have been unrelated to the increased stress levels associ-
ated with military deployment. Furthermore, certain fac-
tors associated with military deployment make these data
more difficult to interpret than studies that use nonmili-
tary samples. For instance, increased mental and physical
requirements, as well as dysregulated sleep, might ac-
count for increases in both stress and energy drink use,
and the two may not necessarily be causally linked.
Potential for stressful situations to be associated with
increased use of energy drinks was provided by Rizvi
et al.43 This study found that 38.94% of a Pakistani stu-
dent sample claimed to have increased their coffee, tea,
and energy drink consumption during pre-examination
time. However, a limitation of the study was that it did
not report the use of these products individually, making
it impossible to relate the findings specifically to energy
drinks. Furthermore, findings from this study should be
interpreted with caution in light of the fact that the au-
thors made a number of unsubstantiated claims. For in-
stance, they stated, ‘‘it was observed that the intake of
caffeine, tea and energy drinks most commonly affected
metabolism, immunity, moods and sleeping patterns,
which is in accordance with studies previously pub-
lished’’ (p. 153), when their research was cross sectional
in nature and no inferential statistics were reported. The
authors also stated that ‘‘According to our study the stu-
dents consume increased amounts of energy drinks and
caffeine in the form of coffee, tea because they think it
helps lift their mood and improves alertness’’ (p. 154), al-
though no reasons for using the products were actually
reported. The authors then concluded by saying ‘‘In
light of the statistics obtained through this research, we
recommend that students should inculcate physical activ-
ity and regular praying in their lives to combat stress ef-
fectively’’ (p. 154). This suggestion is again unfounded
as no links between such activities and stress levels
were reported in their article.
Pettit and DeBarr44 investigated whether perceived
stress in undergraduate students was related to six mea-
sures of energy drink consumption. Significant positive
correlations were observed with the following three mea-
sures: (1) number of days on which at least one energy
drink was consumed in the previous 30 days, (2) average
number of days per week on which energy drinks were
consumed in the previous 30 days, and (3) the largest
number of energy drinks consumed on any occasion in
the previous 30 days. Although relationships with the
number of energy drinks consumed the previous day,
number of days on which energy drinks were consumed
in the previous 7 days, and the approximate number of
energy drinks consumed on days in which energy
drinks were consumed in the previous 30 days were not
significant, the effects were all in the same (positive)
direction.

´os et al.45 found no difference between those who

RICHARDS AND SMITH
 students, even though nearly half of those surveyed
claimed that using caffeinated products was useful for
coping with stress. However, although soft drink and cof-
fee consumption appeared to increase in times of high
stress, no such effects were observed regarding energy
drinks, hot chocolate, or tea. When interpreting these
findings, it should be noted that the questionnaires were
administered in August, and participants were asked to
answer retrospectively from January to May (term time),
potentially leading to recall bias.
Richards and Smith46 investigated associations be-
tween caffeine and stress, anxiety, and depression in a
large cohort (N = 2307) of British secondary school chil-
dren; the study also differentiated between caffeine con-
sumed from energy drinks, cola, coffee, and tea. Though
stress levels were positively related to total weekly caf-
feine intake (and remained so after other dietary, demo-
graphic, and lifestyle covariates had been controlled
for statistically), no univariate association with caffeine
from energy drinks was observed. At the multivariate
level, however, low (0.1–133 mg/w) caffeine consump-
tion from energy drinks was related to high stress levels,
although no such observation was made regarding high
consumption (‡133 mg/w), and the overall effect was
only marginally significant ( p = 0.067).
Two studies were identified that examined energy
drink usage in relation to posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD). Although it is acknowledged that this phenom-
enon should not be classified under the broader defini-
tions of stress used by other studies discussed in this
section, a consideration of their findings is still deemed
to be useful. Peters et al.47 investigated substance use
by Houstonian youth following Hurricane Ike. Actively
trying to avoid thinking about the event was associated
with a prior 30-day use of antienergy drinks (sometimes
referred to as ‘‘relaxation drinks’’; drinks that include in-
gredients such as melatonin, kava, valerian, and trypto-
phan, which are marketed with claims of promoting
calmness and relaxation48) and energy drinks, although the
latter effect was only marginally significant (p=0.09).
However, although the effect regarding antienergy drinks
was retained in an unadjusted logistic regression model,
which controlled for additional substance use, neither effect
was significant when an adjusted model was used.
Vilija and Romualdas49 found PTSD symptoms to be
positively correlated with frequency of energy drink
consumption in a large sample (N = 1747) of Lithuanian
secondary school children, even after controlling for
sex, index trauma, physical activity, smoking, and sense
of coherence. This article appeared to measure energy
drink consumption based on a previously published
food frequency questionnaire,50 which measured weekly
intake using seven possible responses: ‘‘never,’’ ‘‘less
than once a week,’’ ‘‘about once a week,’’ ‘‘two to four
days a week,’’ ‘‘five to six days a week,’’ ‘‘once a day,
every day,’’ and ‘‘every day, more than once.’’ It should,
however, be noted that a number of other food products
were also associated with PTSD symptoms (e.g., light al-
coholic drinks, spirits, soft drinks, flavored milk, coffee,
fast food, chips, salty snacks, processed foods). More im-
portantly, energy drinks appeared to have been grouped
together with sports drinks, which may have confounded
the analysis.
Anxiety.
Hofmeister et al.39 (described previously)
found anxiety levels to be higher in energy drink con-
sumers compared to nonconsumers in two samples of
students. However, anxiety was only higher in regular
users compared to nonregular users in one of the two
samples, making it difficult to conclude whether such a
relationship may be dose dependent or not. In addition
to this, Evren and Evren51 reported energy drink use in
a very large sample (N = 4957) of 10th grade students
from Turkey to be associated with anxiety; compared
to nonuse in the past year, anxiety scores were higher
in those who had used the products once in their lifetime,
once to three times in a month, once to five times a week,
and every day. However, the effects did not remain sig-
nificant at the multivariate level.
Stasio et al.52 found that 29% of anxiety scores in a
sample of young adults comprising college student ath-
letes, Reserve Officers Training Corps cadets, and psy-
chology students were explained by energy drink
consumption (measured in terms of the number of cans
consumed in the previous 7 days); even one’s sleep qual-
ity and other caffeinated drink consumption were con-
trolled for statistically. In a similar manner, Trapp
et al.40 (described earlier) observed anxiety scores to cor-
relate positively with energy drink use in their total sam-
ple, as well as in males and females separately. However,
in their most conservative multivariate analysis, the ef-
fect only remained significant in males. Those who con-
sumed either ‡100 mL/d or ‡250 mL/d were also found
to report higher anxiety levels than nonconsumers;
these effects were observed in both the total sample
and in males, although not in females. In addition to
these findings, a study of US university students (Mali-
nauskas et al.53) investigated energy drink use in relation
to heart palpitations and ‘‘jolt and crash episodes.’’ The
authors of the study defined this latter term as relating
to ‘‘a feeling of increased alertness and energy (the
jolt) followed by a sudden drop in energy (the crash).’’
The study observed a dose-dependent relationship be-
tween experiencing weekly jolt and crash episodes and
the total number of energy drinks consumed at one
time. A similar association was also reported for heart
palpitations, although was only marginally significant
( p = 0.09).
Richards and Smith46 (described earlier) observed that
total weekly caffeine consumption was positively related
to anxiety. When differentiating between sources of the
substance, no univariate association between caffeine
A REVIEW OF ENERGY DRINKS AND MENTAL HEALTH
59
 from energy drinks and anxiety level was observed.
Although a trend ( p = 0.087) was detected for low con-
sumption (0.1–133 mg/w) of caffeine from energy drinks
to be related to high anxiety at the multivariate level, no
association was made with high consumption (‡133 mg/
w), and the overall effect was not significant.
Although most studies have reported positive relation-
ships, Yudko and McNiece54 found no association be-
tween trait or state anxiety and having used energy
drinks in the previous hour in a sample of polydrug
users attending a rehabilitation clinic in Hawaii. How-
ever, considering the relatively small sample size
(N = 69), and that only nine participants had consumed
an energy drink in the previous hour, it is likely that
this study lacked the level of statistical power required
to detect such effects. In further relation to the use of
other substances, a study of 757 undergraduate students
conducted by Snipes et al.55 found that anxiety sensitiv-
ity was lower in users of alcoholic energy drinks (i.e.,
drinks in which alcohol and energy drinks are mixed
together) compared to alcohol-only users. The explana-
tion given by the authors was that people with high anx-
iety sensitivity might avoid energy drinks due to the
stimulant properties having potential to exacerbate their
symptoms.
Depression.
Although Richards and Smith46 (described
earlier) reported positive associations between total
weekly caffeine intake and depression scores in British
secondary school children, no significant findings were
made when caffeine intake from energy drinks was in-
vestigated separately. Arria et al.56 also found no differ-
ences in depression scores between high-frequency
energy drink users (i.e., ‡52 during the past year), low-
frequency energy drink users (i.e., 1–51 in the past
year), and nonusers in a large sample (N = 1097) of fourth
year US undergraduate students. In a similar manner,
Hofmeister et al.39 (described earlier) observed no differ-
ences between energy drink users and nonusers in two
samples of US veterinary students. However, in one of
these samples, regular users were found to report signif-
icantly higher depression scores than nonregular users. A
very large study of Canadian schoolchildren (N = 8210)
conducted by Azagba et al.57 also observed higher de-
pression scores to be associated with using energy drinks
once per month or more.
Trapp et al.40 (described earlier) found initial positive
relationships between energy drink consumption and de-
pression in a sample of young adult Australians. How-
ever, although these relationships were observed in
both the total sample and in males, they were not ob-
served in females and did not remain significant once
other factors had been controlled for statistically. Inter-
estingly, although consumption of ‡250 mL/d was not
associated with depression in the total sample, or in males
or females separately, those who consumed ‡100mL/d
reported higher levels of depression than those who did
not consume energy drinks at all. However, this relation-
ship was observed only in the total sample and not in ei-
ther sex independently.
Evren and Evren51 (described earlier) observed posi-
tive associations between energy drink use and depres-
sion, self-harming behavior, and suicidal thoughts in
10th grade students from Turkey. In each case, the
effects appeared to be dose dependent. Although the re-
lationships with depression disappeared at the multivari-
ate level, self-harming behavior and suicidal thoughts
remained associated with consuming energy drinks every
day compared to not at all. Snipes et al.55 (described
earlier) reported no difference in hopelessness scores be-
tween users of alcoholic energy drinks and alcohol-only
consumers, and Yudko and McNiece54 (described ear-
lier) observed no relationship between depression scores
and having consumed an energy drink in the previous
hour.
Discussion
Energy drink use and mental health
Although acute mood effects associated with energy
drinks appear often to be positive, chronic use tends to
be associated with undesirable mental health effects.
Ten studies were identified that examined stress or stress-
related outcomes in relation to energy drink use. Of
these, two studies investigated PTSD: one reported a sig-
nificant positive association,49 whereas the other did
not.47 Three further studies did not include a direct mea-
sure of stress,41–43 although one of them (Toblin et al.41)
did report a positive association between energy drink
consumption and instances of sleep disruption due to
stress. Of the five studies that did provide direct measure-
ments of energy drink consumption and stress, two45,46
reported no association; the other three39,40,44 each
reported positive relationships, as well as null findings,
depending on which analyses were evaluated. For exam-
ple, Hofmeister et al.39 presented findings from two dif-
ferent samples and also compared between energy drink
users and nonusers, as well as between regular users and
nonregular users. Some of these analyses yielded signif-
icant results, whereas others did not. Quantifying the
overall outcome of such studies in relation to those that
presented more straightforward analyses was therefore
difficult. Similar issues relating to three studies39,40,51
were also encountered when discussing findings relating
to anxiety and depression.
Eight studies investigated energy drinks and anxi-
ety, or anxiety-related variables. Malinauskas et al.53
utilized indirect measures: a positive association was
observed with weekly jolt and crash episodes, but the re-
lationship with heart palpitations was not significant.
Of the seven studies that provided direct measures,
two46,54 reported no significant relationships, one52 reported
60
RICHARDS AND SMITH
 a positive relationship, three39,40,51 reported both posi-
tive relationships and null findings, depending on
which analyses were examined, and one55 reported a
negative relationship. However, it should be noted that
this last study compared consumers of alcoholic energy
drinks to alcohol-only users, whereas the other studies
listed investigated associations with energy drinks in
the absence of alcohol.
Eight studies examined depression in relation to en-
ergy drink use. Snipes et al.55 investigated a related con-
cept, ‘‘hopelessness,’’ although no association was found
with alcoholic energy drink use. Of the seven studies that
provided direct measures, three46,54,56 reported no signif-
icant relationships, one57 reported a positive relationship,
and three39,40,51 reported both positive relationships and
null findings. In addition, Evren and Evren51 also reported
positive associations between energy drink use and self-
harming behavior and suicidal thoughts.
From the studies identified that related to stress, anx-
iety, and depression, only one (Snipes et al.55) reported
a negative association with energy drink use. Although
null findings were also observed, a considerable num-
ber of studies reported positive relationships. This latter
observation was therefore in line with the case reports
identified in the area, which associated energy drink
usage with a number of mental health conditions, as
well as other studies that reported positive associations be-
tween energy drink use and low well-being36 and general
health.37
Potential mechanisms of action
As caffeine consumption itself has been associated
with a number of psychiatric disorders,9 the findings
reported in the current review uphold the idea that effects
observed in relation to energy drinks may be dependent
on caffeine.7 Although the lack of evidence for causality
may be in accordance with the idea that caffeine use and
mental health problems are simply correlated,8 the vast
majority of studies identified here utilized cross-sectional
designs. In most cases therefore, causality or direction of
effect could not be inferred. One possibility is that those
with low well-being, or mental health problems such as
depression and anxiety, self-medicate58 by using energy
drinks as a short-term ‘‘pick me up.’’ This usage pattern
could therefore explain how the acute mood effects are
often positive, whereas the long-term associations are
not. Support for this idea is provided in that students
are known to use caffeine as a coping strategy during
stressful situations.59,60
Another possibility is that positive relationships ob-
served between energy drink use and mental health prob-
lems are mediated by dysregulated sleep. However,
determining the direction of such relationships may be
difficult. Sleep debt could, for instance, cause fatigue
leading to increased use of energy drinks. Conversely,
as caffeine is known to interfere with sleep, sleep loss
could lead to symptoms associated with mental health
problems. It may also be that the relationship is bidirec-
tional. For instance, children are known to use caffein-
ated products to remain awake at night when using
media-related technology,61 and students have reported
using energy drinks to combat the effects of insufficient
sleep.53
Limitations and directions for future research
A limitation of the current article is that the search cri-
teria did not address additional aspects of mental health
such as schizophrenia, personality disorder, and suicidal-
ity. Although some of the case reports identified suggest
that energy drink use may be associated with such out-
comes, it was deemed beyond the scope of the current ar-
ticle to examine them in greater detail. As this review
aimed instead to focus more upon stress, anxiety, and de-
pression, these phenomena may therefore be an area of
interest for future research.
The majority of studies identified were conducted in
young populations, potentially reflecting their compara-
tively high consumption of energy drinks. However,
the disproportionately large number of studies utilizing
university students might be due to the relative ease
in which such participants can be recruited. Studies
into younger populations may therefore be meritorious
because children are both targeted by energy drinks
advertisers and likely to be relatively naive caffeine con-
sumers. In addition, research into older populations may
be of interest. For instance, late adolescence and early
adulthood are associated with the onset of psychiatric
disorders and stress associated with adjustment to many
life changes, and also represent populations that are
likely to report energy drink use. For these reasons, the
question should be asked as to whether the relationships
observed are unique to young persons or are also found in
older populations.
As the majority of studies identified in this review
were cross sectional, longitudinal and intervention stud-
ies are required. An example of a study design that may
be useful for investigating causality and direction of the
relationships in question comes from Wing et al.38 who
conducted an intervention involving sleep education.
Those in the intervention condition improved in terms
of mental health and, additionally, reduced their energy
drink intake. Further studies of this nature could avoid
ethical concerns regarding administering energy drink
products to participants, while furthering our knowledge
of how sleep, energy drink use, and mental health out-
comes are related. Longitudinal studies could also be
used to track changes in energy drink consumption and
mental health status over time. By doing this, analyses
could be conducted to investigate whether changes in
consumption are predictive of changes in mental health
outcomes.
A REVIEW OF ENERGY DRINKS AND MENTAL HEALTH
61
 Conclusions
The current article has aimed to provide a review of the
literature relating to energy drink use and mental health.
Because most of the studies identified examined stress,
anxiety, and depression, particular focus was placed on
these areas. Although a number of studies investigating
acute effects of energy drinks on mood reported benefits,
only one such observation was made in relation to chronic
use. Although null findings were also relatively common,
most studies of chronic use provided evidence to suggest
that energy drinks are associated with mental health prob-
lems. However, as almost all studies identified were cross
sectional, and some did not control for other relevant fac-
tors, such as sex, socioeconomic status, and additional caf-
feine intake, the nature of these relationships is not yet
fully understood. Therefore, to improve our understanding
of such phenomena, longitudinal and intervention studies
are required.
