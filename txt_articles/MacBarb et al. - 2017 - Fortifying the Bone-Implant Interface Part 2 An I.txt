Abstract
Background
Minimally invasive surgical fusion of the sacroiliac (SI) joint using machined solid triangular titanium plasma spray
(TPS) coated implants has demonstrated positive clinical outcomes in SI joint pain patients. Additive manufac-
tured (AM), i.e. 3D-printed, fenestrated triangular titanium implants with porous surfaces and bioactive agents,
such as nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (HA) or autograft, may further optimize bony fixation and subsequent bio-
mechanical stability.
Methods
A bilateral ovine distal femoral defect model was used to evaluate the cancellous bone-implant interfaces of TPS-
coated and AM implants. Four implant groups (n=6/group/time-point) were included: 1)TPS-coated, 2)AM,
3)AM+HA, and 4)AM+Autograft. The bone-implant interfaces of 6- and 12-week specimens were investigated via
radiographic, biomechanical, and histomorphometric methods.
Results
Imaging showed peri-implant bone formation around all implants. Push-out testing demonstrated forces greater
than 2500 N, with no significant differences among groups. While TPS implants failed primarily at the bone-
implant interface, AM groups failed within bone ~2-3mm away from implant surfaces. All implants exhibited bone
ongrowth, with no significant differences among groups. AM implants had significantly more bone ingrowth into
their porous surfaces than TPS-coated implants (p<0.0001). Of the three AM groups, AM+Auto implants had the
greatest bone ingrowth into the porous surface and through their core (p<0.002).
Conclusions
Both TPS and AM implants exhibited substantial bone ongrowth and ingrowth, with additional bone through
growth into the AM implants’ core. Overall, AM implants experienced significantly more bone infiltration com-
pared to TPS implants. While HA-coating did not further enhance results, the addition of autograft fostered
greater osteointegration for AM implants.
Clinical Relevance
Additive manufactured implants with a porous surface provide a highly interconnected porous surface that has
comparatively greater surface area for bony integration. Results suggest this may prove advantageous toward pro-
moting enhanced biomechanical stability compared to TPS-coated implants for SI joint fusion procedures.

Introduction
Chronic low back pain (LBP) is a widespread public
health burden with a tremendous socio-economic
impact. Cross-sectional population-based surveys
have demonstrated that 13.1% of U.S. adults age 20 –
69 suffer from LBP, with a higher prevalence in
women.1 Health care costs for treatment and lost
wages due to LBP are estimated to exceed $250 bil-
lion annually in the U.S alone.2 The sacroiliac (SI)
joint has been recognized as the source of pain in 15 –
30% of LBP patients.3-7 When conservative approach-

 es fail, surgical intervention, such as a minimally in-
vasive fusion procedure, may be a viable option.
Prospective clinical trials8-10 have shown high levels
of pain relief and improvement in disability scores
and quality of life in patients undergoing SI joint fu-
sion with a series of titanium plasma spray (TPS)
coated triangular implants placed transarticularly
across the SI joint. Computed tomography scan
follow-up in the two U.S. trials have shown high rates
of bone adherence to implants and signs of bridging
bone across the SI joint.8,10 A small number of sub-
jects in the trials (2-3%) experienced recurrent or
persistent pain along with radiolucencies around the
implants, particularly within the sacrum. In some
cases, patients underwent revision surgery (typically
placement of an additional implant, sometimes with
removal of implants placed during the index proce-
dure). The rate of revision surgery after SI joint fu-
sion with triangular titanium implants is low (<4% at
4 years,11i.e., approximately 1/3 of that after lumbar
surgery12); however, there remains room for improve-
ment. Methods to enhance the biological fixation be-
tween these SI joint fusion implants and the sur-
rounding host bone presents as an opportunity to in-
crease the long-term effectiveness of this procedure
and to further reduce the rate of revision surgery.
Since the introduction of porous coatings into the or-
thopedic community in the late 1960s,13 TPS-
coatings have seen the most widespread usage in hip
and knee implants, and more recently in spine im-
plants.14,15. Notable spinal applications include inter-
body fusion cages and artificial discs.16,17 TPS-coated
surfaces are characterized by a graded distribution of
pores ranging from 100-150μm at the surface that
transition to a solid base,18 typically resulting in high-
ly variable surfaces with low pore interconnectivity
that do not emulate native bone structure.14,19,20 Re-
cent articles on engineered bone scaffolds, however,
suggest that highly interconnected porous surfaces
with pore sizes ranging from 200–400μm and porosi-
ties of 45-65% are ideal for maximizing bone-implant
integration.21,22 The recent advent of additive manu-
facturing, i.e. 3D-printing, allows for fabrication of
implants with previously unachievable geometries
that have more consistent and highly controlled
porous surfaces.23 While additive manufactured
(AM) implants are now being used clinically, in situ
data describing their osteointegration characteristics
are limited.
Another means to elicit greater bone apposition to
implant surfaces is to enhance surface bioactivity. Of
the available methods, hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings
have been the most extensively used for orthopedic
implants.24 The most common method to HA-coat
an implant is plasma-spraying. This line-of-site
process, however, cannot uniformly penetrate a
porous structure, and thereby results in variable sur-
face coverage that often occludes desirable surface
features.25 An alternative method is to deliver
nanocrystalline HA particles via dip-coating precipi-
tate. This method has been shown to foster early
bone formation adjacent to smooth titanium and
polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants in vivo,26,27
and to fully penetrate AM porous metal surfaces (see
Part I). However, whether the addition of nanocrys-
talline HA to AM titanium porous implants pro-
motes enhanced bone apposition in vivo remains un-
known.
This study evaluated the bone-implant interface of
TPS-coated implants and AM implants in an ovine
femoral defect model. Control implants were TPS-
coated triangular implants FDA-cleared for SI joint
fusion. The AM implants incorporated a printed
porous surface designed to mimic cancellous bone
architecture and an open fenestrated geometry that
can accept bone graft. It was hypothesized that 1) the
AM implants would display similar or enhanced bio-
mechanical stability and bone integration compared
to TPS-coated implants; 2) the AM implant design
would allow for bone ongrowth and ingrowth to the
porous surface and through the implant’s core; and
3) the addition of nanocrystalline HA to the surface
of the AM implants or placing autograft onto and in-
to the AM implants would further promote osteoin-
tegration.

 BONE, Inc. San Jose, CA). Test implants were addi-
tive manufactured via electron beam melting tech-
nology (Arcam AB, Mölndal, Sweden) using
Ti6Al4V ELI powder per ASTM F3001. All im-
plants were 7.0mm in inscribed solid core diameter,
triangular in cross-section, and 45 mm in length. AM
implants were designed to have an open fenestrated
structure and a ~0.75mm thick porous surface to of-
fer greater available surface area for enhanced os-
teointegration (Figure 1). The porous surface was
generated using parameters previously determined in
vitro (see Part I) to have an average pore size of
300μm to promote osteointegration,22 and an average
porosity of 60% to fall within the range of native can-
cellous bone28. AM implants were either investigated
as is, coated with a nanocrystalline HA-coating
(AM+HA), or augmented with autograft (AM+Au-
to). In total, there were 4 experimental conditions.
For AM+HA implants, a ~20nm layer of HA was ap-
plied to implant surfaces using a dip-coating precipi-
tate technique as previously described.26,27 AM+Auto
implants are described in the Animal Model section
below. All implants were gamma-sterilized prior to
use.
Animal Model
The study protocol was approved by the IACUC at
MPI Research (Mattawan, MI). Implants (n=6 per
group) were placed in 24 healthy skeletally mature fe-
male Suffolk sheep with each animal receiving im-
plants from two different groups. Under general
anesthesia, bilateral triangular distal femoral defects
were created using a guide pin, trephine, and broach
under fluoroscopic guidance such that the implants
were predominantly placed in cancellous bone. For
animals receiving an AM+Auto implant, bilateral
bone cores obtained from the trephines were com-
bined, ground, and pressed into the porous surface
and open fenestrated windows. All implants were
press-fit medial-to-lateral. Prophylactic pre- and
post-operative antibiotics were administered. Once
recovered from anesthesia, sheep were returned to
their housings and were able to walk undisturbed on
the first postoperative day. Sheep were maintained in
housing with normal access to food and water until
euthanasia at 6 or 12 weeks.
Postmortem Evaluations
At necropsy, radiographic images were obtained. Im-
plants were removed en-bloc and bisected (Figure
2A). Biomechanical push-out testing was performed
using a uniaxial testing frame (Instron, series 566A)
with a triangular ram and a base with a triangular
clearance hole. A 10mm thick section was obtained
from the medial side of each specimen, where only
cancellous bone surrounded the segment (Figure
2A). Each specimen was pushed out of cancellous
bone at 5 mm/min until fully separated, as previously
described.29 Maximum push-out force, energy-to-
failure, and ultimate shear strength were calculated
(area for shear strength was calculated as the sum of
the 3 nominal triangular faces). The lateral side of
each implant was fixed in 10% neutral buffered forma-
lin and submitted for microcomputed tomography
(μCT) and histopathology. For μCT, tissue blocks
were scanned at a resolution of 24.5μm3 (Scanco
Micro-CT 100). Specimens were then embedded in
methylmethacrylate. Sections were taken as close as
possible to two targeted locations (A and B in Figure
2A) on all implants and stained with Stevenel’s blue/
van Gieson stain. A blinded pathologist scored the
presence of lamellar bone into quartiles to assess
bone maturation at the surface of all implants and

particles for both the base and porous surface structures. Bottom:

 within the central region of the AM groups. Semi-
quantitative scoring was also conducted to assess
necrosis and inflammation using a similar quartile
scale. Quantitative histomorphometric analysis was
performed on all slides to quantify 1) bone in contact
with the periphery (i.e., bone ongrowth) of the im-
plants, 2) bone area within the porous surfaces (i.e.,
bone ingrowth) of all implants and, and 3) bone area
within the central region (i.e., bone through growth)
of the AM implants for A and B sections (Figure 3),
based on a method previously described.30 For each
implant, data from A and B sections were combined
for analysis. Bone-in-contact assessments are pre-
sented as a percentage of available surface length
(%BIC), while bone area assessments are presented
as a percentage of the associated available area
(%BA).
Statistical Methods
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (ver-
sion 9.0, Cary, NC) and Excel. SAS PROC MIXED
was used to perform linear mixed models using a re-
stricted maximum likelihood estimation method.
Models were constructed with time and treatment as
fixed effects and animal as a random variable. Analy-
sis was conducted considering data from both time-
points together or stratified by each time-point. The
fixed effects estimates were examined for each AM
group compared to the TPS-coated implants. When
type III tests of fixed effects were significant
(p<0.05), a least squares means post hoc comparison
was used to look for treatment level effects. Parame-
ters with p<0.05 were considered statistically signifi-
cant. Data are presented as mean ± standard devia-
tion.
Results
Implants and Sheep Model
The AM implants met all design inputs aside from
the coating thickness, which due to the printing
process was slightly thicker than the design input. All
sheep were skeletally mature as confirmed radi-

 ographically. Pre-operative weights were
93.65±9.3kg. No signs of substantial weight change
were observed at the time of necropsy, and all sheep
completed their in-life phase in good health. All im-
plants were placed without complication. Gross ex-
amination at necropsy demonstrated normal post-
operative healing. Post-mortem radiographic images
showed peri-implant bone formation in all cases (Fig-
ure 2B-D).
Biomechanics
Biomechanical push-out testing showed no signifi-
cant differences among groups at either time-point
for peak push-out force, energy-to-failure, or ulti-
mate shear strength. Peak push-out and energy-to-
failure values are presented in Table 1. Ultimate
shear strength results are presented in Figure 4A. All
metrics were significantly greater at 12 weeks com-
pared to 6 weeks (p<0.05). Gross examination re-
vealed “spot-welds” of bone remaining attached
post-pushout testing to TPS implants, whereas a
~2-3 mm continuous ring of integrated bone re-
mained attached to all AM groups following testing
(Figure 4B). Furthermore, tissue was observed grow-
ing into the open fenestrations and throughout the
core of all AM groups (Figure 4B).
Microcomputed Tomography
Microcomputed tomography results showed evi-
dence of peri-implant bone around all implants, with
dark areas observed around implant corners and cen-
tral regions (Figure 5). Histologic analysis showed
continuous bone formation around the periphery of
all implants and within the core of the AM groups
(Figure 6), verifying the dark areas observed under
μCT to be artifact. Due to this scattering artifact,
bone volume and density were not quantified using
μCT.

Semi-Quantitative Histomorphometry
Semi-quantitative histomorphometric analysis (Table

all treatment groups to be 2 at 6 weeks, i.e. 50:50
lamellar to woven bone. By 12 weeks, the median
scores of TPS and AM+Auto implants increased to 3
(50-75% lamellar bone), while AM and AM+HA
groups remained unchanged at 2. At 6 weeks, the
median score for bone maturation within the center
region of the AM implants was 0 for the AM group,

 while the AM+HA and AM+Auto groups had medi-
an scores of 1 (25-50% lamellar bone). By 12 weeks,
median scores increased to 2 for the AM and
AM+Auto groups, while the AM+HA remained un-
changed at 1. Bone fragments from implantation
were observed within the porous surfaces of all im-
plants, and within the core of the AM implants,
demonstrating self-harvesting of host bone. No
necrosis and very few inflammatory cells (median
scores of 0) were seen in any of the sections at either
time point, providing no evidence of a safety issue.
Quantitative Histomorphometry
Quantitative histomorphometric analysis results are
presented in Table 3. At 6 weeks, %BIC was found to
be significantly greater in TPS implants compared to
all other groups (p<0.003), with no other differences
among groups. By 12 weeks, there were no significant
differences in %BIC among groups. Time was a sig-
nificant factor toward increasing %BIC at 12 weeks
(p<0.004). At 6 weeks, %BA within the porous sur-
faces was found to be significantly greater in TPS im-
plants compared to all other groups (p<0.01). By 12
weeks, there were no significant differences in %BA
within the porous surfaces among TPS, AM and
AM+Auto groups, with AM+HA implants having
significantly less %BA within their porous surfaces
compared to TPS implants at this time (p<0.03). At
6 weeks, % BA within the center region was found be
significantly greater in AM+Auto implants compared
to AM (p<0.049) and AM+HA (p<0.04) implants.
By 12 weeks, the AM+HA implants (p<0.01) had sig-
nificantly lower %BA within the center compared to
AM+Auto implants. Time was a significant factor
(p<0.01).
By design, the porous surface of the AM implants of-
fered comparatively greater available surface length
and area. To quantify these differences, the histolog-
ic A sections of the TPS and AM implants were
compared, revealing that the AM surface provides
1.4x the available surface length (p<0.0001) and 2.8x
the available area (p<0.0001) for osteointegration
compared to the TPS surface per Student’s t-test
(Figure 7A-B). These significant differences in sur-
face structure merited additional analysis on data not
normalized to surface length or surface area to com-
pare the amount of bone contacting the surface and
growing within the porous surface/central region for
the different implant groups (Table 3). Analyzing the
data as such showed no difference in BIC among
groups at either time point, with time again being a
significant factor (p<0.001). On the other hand, at 6
weeks, BA filling the porous surfaces was found to be
significantly greater in all AM groups compared to

treatment groups shown at original magnification (1x). Qualitative
assessment showed that bone ongrowth/ingrowth to all treatment
groups was substantial by 6 weeks and changed with time as the bone
matured. Some soft tissue was also seen in contact with the implants,
which was mainly composed of a collagen-rich transitional tissue. Bone
could also be seen within the central region through the open
fenestrations in all AM implant groups. Note that bone forms
continuously around the periphery of the implants, and within the open
core of the AM implant groups, indicating the dark regions observed
under µCT to be artifact. TPS = titanium plasma spray, AM = additive

Discussion
This study compared the in vivo bone response to
traditional TPS-coated implants versus fenestrated
AM implants. As hypothesized, AM implants with
or without HA coating or autograft displayed similar
biomechanical and, in some cases, enhanced histo-
morphometric results compared to the TPS-implant,
similar to results achieved in vitro (see Part I). Fur-
ther, gross examination and microscopic evaluation
showed bone through growth into the core of the AM
implants. The nanocrystalline HA coating was not
found to further promote osteointegration, corrobo-
rating results previously determined in vitro (see Part
I). Placing autograft onto and into the AM implants,
however, was found to be advantageous, as anticipat-
ed. Specifically, AM+Auto implants had the greatest
(although not significant) push-out measurements
and significantly greater bone ongrowth/ingrowth
compared to all other groups, suggesting the
AM+Auto group may further promote osteointegra-
tion. While all implants investigated formed strong,
stable interfaces with host bone, the AM+Auto group
data suggests that addition of autograft to AM im-
plants may produce an even more fortified bone-
implant interface.
In the present study, quantitative histomorphometric
analysis normalized to available surface length or sur-
face area found the TPS-implants to have significant-
ly greater %BIC and %BA within the porous surface
than all other groups at 6 weeks (Table 3). These re-
sults, however, were not consistent with push-out da-
ta, as the significantly greater %BIC for the TPS im-
plants did not result in significantly different biome-
chanics results at this time point. Although normaliz-
ing BIC and BA to available surface length and area,
respectively, is the most common means to analyze
quantitative histomorphometric data, the significant
differences in the available surface length and area
between the TPS and AM surfaces may suggest BIC
and BA are more appropriate comparative metrics
for this study. Viewing the data in this way showed
no difference in BIC among groups, consistent with
the biomechanics results at either time point. No-
tably, at 12 weeks, the ultimate shear strength of the
AM+Auto group was 1.2x greater than TPS implants
(p=0.050), whereas the BIC of the AM+Auto group

sections for available surface length (A) and available area within the
surface (B). Results for both metrics were significantly greater in the AM
surfaces (averaged across all three AM implant groups) compared to the
TPS implants (‡ = p < 0.0001). Bone area (BA) within the porous surface
and central region is shown in (C). For AM implant groups, the “hashed”
regions of (C) signify the contribution of BA within the central region,
whereas the “unhashed” regions signify the contribution of BA within the
porous surface. Bars having the same letter are significantly different (p <
0.05). Roman letters refer to 6 week results, while Greek letters refer to
12 week results. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation. TPS

 was 1.3x greater than TPS implants (p=0.050) at this
time point. BA within the porous surface and total
BA, on the other hand, were found to be significantly
greater in all AM groups compared to the TPS im-
plants, with AM+Auto implants having the greatest
values at both time points (Figure 7C). Thus, the
AM implants all experienced significantly more bony
ongrowth, ingrowth, and through growth compared
to the TPS implants, which correlates with the dif-
fering biomechanical failure modes between implant
designs (Figure 5C). A study on implant stability in
rabbit tibia showed comparable results, finding simi-
lar trends between implant stability assessed via reso-
nance frequency and bone-implant contact area for
titanium screws.31 While both the TPS and AM im-
plants formed stable interfaces with host bone, these
results indicate that they each have distinct mecha-
nisms for promoting implant stabilization that may
influence the degree of biological fixation.
The differences in porous surface structure and the
solid versus fenestrated architecture of the TPS and
AM implants may further explain the distinctive
push-out failure mechanisms. Specifically, while the
TPS implants failed primarily at the bone-implant in-
terface, a ~2-3mm ring of continuous and integrated
host bone remained securely attached to all three
AM implant groups (Figure 5C). The decreased
depth of bone ingrowth into the TPS coating likely
resulted in the bone failing more cleanly from the
surface. The deeper bone ingrowth into highly inter-
connected pores apparent throughout the full thick-
ness of the AM surface, as well as the additional bone
through growth into the fenestrations, likely resulted
in an enhanced bone interlock throughout the AM
implant’s entire structure. These results are consis-
tent with a study that found the ultimate shear
strength of AM titanium rods with a porous surface
to be significantly greater than TPS-coated rods in
ovine tibial cortical bone at both 4 and 12 weeks.32
Bertollo et al. attributed their results to greater os-
teointegration into the more porous surface of their
AM scaffolds.32 Although the present study did not
similarly find statistical differences in the push-out
testing of the AM versus TPS implants, this may be
due to fact that the testing was conducted on seg-
ments fully surrounded by cancellous bone. While
the ultimate shear strength of sheep cancellous bone
has yet to be reported, the ultimate shear strength of
bovine femoral cancellous bone has been measured at
6.57±2.46 MPa.33 Looking to Figure 5A, it can be
seen that the majority of the tested sample’s ultimate
shear strengths were within the range of cancellous
bone. Unlike the TPS implants, the bone-implant in-
terface of all the AM groups remained intact after ≥
2500N of force; this indicates that the bone-implant
interface is stronger that than the surrounding can-
cellous bone. Taken together, the differing push-out
failure mechanisms encountered in the present study
may demonstrate that the integrity of the bone inte-
gration of AM implants with cancellous bone is
greater than that of the TPS implants.
It is known that the local mechanical environment in
the healing peri-implant interface tissue stimulates
cellular differentiation and tissue synthesis.34 A study
in rabbit femoral condyles found host bone integrated
more rapidly with sintered porous-surfaced implants
during early healing compared to TPS-coated im-
plants.35 A follow-up finite element analysis found the
comparatively more open porous structure of the sin-
tered porous-surfaces provided a local mechanical
environment that favored mineralization compared
to the less porous surface of the TPS-coating.36 Giv-
en the more open and interconnected nature of the
AM porous surfaces, it is possible that the tissue lev-
el stresses and strains are more favorable around the
fenestrated AM implants compared to the TPS im-
plants. Viewing bone formation around the different
implant designs in Figure 8 corroborates this theory.
While bone surrounding the TPS-coated implants is
less-organized and more compacted than native tra-
becular bone, bone surrounding the AM implants is
organized in a more normal trabecular formation,
with bone struts aligning with the porous surface fea-
tures. This could indicate a more physiological load-
transfer through the AM porous surface compared to
the TPS-coated surface, although, given the differ-
ences in load transfer in this model compared to that
in humans, the clinical implications of this finding
warrant further investigation. However, a more
open, fenestrated design of the AM implants com-
pared to the solid-based TPS implants has the poten-
tial for a more physiological interface with cancellous
bone that, based on the previous rabbit study,35,36 po-
tentially integrates more rapidly and effectively.

 There are certain limitations to the present in vivo
study that should be considered. An ovine model is
widely used to investigate orthopedic implants, as it
displays similar bone ingrowth and mineral apposi-
tion rates to humans,37 and its size accommodates
clinically-sized implants,38 although sheep do have
comparatively greater bone density.39 While the pre-
sent results are from a healthy bone environment, the
increased bone integration and better load transmis-
sion of the AM implants may prove beneficial com-
pared to solid TPS implants in instances of impaired
bone health,40 meriting future work in this area. Fur-
ther, the implants in this model were placed in the
distal femur; however, the clinical utility of these im-
plants is to promote SI joint stabilization and fusion.
Although it remains unknown how the AM implants
would respond if placed across the SI joint, it is hy-
pothesized that the additional loads and loading
schemes would require greater implant-bone stabili-
ty. The combined bony integration onto, into, and
through the AM implant may therefore be more sta-
ble and reliable than surface growth alone in the TPS
implants across the joint environment. Future stud-
ies should be conducted to test this hypothesis.
Overall, results presented in this study corroborate
previous clinical investigations of the TPS im-
plant.8-10,41,42 Specifically, the TPS implants were
found to exhibit a substantial degree of bone on-
growth and ingrowth to their surfaces, resulting in a
mechanically stable interface with surrounding host
bone. The AM implants investigated herein provide
a highly interconnected porous surface with an open
fenestrated core structure that offers comparatively
greater surface area for bony integration and the abili-
ty to be pre-packed with graft material, which may
benefit a number of spinal implants, such as fusion,
disc, and SI joint implants. These AM implants like-
wise demonstrated substantial bone ongrowth and in-
growth to their porous surfaces, with additional bone
through growth in the cores. Although similar HA
coatings have previously demonstrated a beneficial
effect on non-porous titanium surfaces or inert struc-
tures, such as PEEK,26,27 the current study showed
that the dip, spin, heat treated nanocrystalline HA
coating did not further enhance results compared to
uncoated AM implants. The addition of autograft, on
the other hand, resulted in significantly increased
bone ingrowth and through growth within the AM
implant, potentially further promoting osteointegra-
tion. As a whole, the AM implants experienced sig-
nificantly more bony infiltration compared to the
TPS implants. Taken together, the AM implant has
the potential of promoting an enhanced bone-
implant interface compared to TPS-coated implants
that could provide additional stabilization upon im-
plantation.

surface features between the two implant designs. Note that the porous
surface of the AM implants is thicker than that of the TPS-coating. New
bone can be seen within the open portion of the AM implant. The
trabecular morphology around the AM implant is well-organized and
aligns with the porous features of the surface, whereas a more
compacted morphology is evident around the TPS-coated implant. This
may indicate more physiological load-transfer through the AM implant
compared to the TPS-coated implant.
