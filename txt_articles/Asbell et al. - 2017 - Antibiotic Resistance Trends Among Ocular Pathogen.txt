Introduction: Mosquito­borne infectious diseases such as dengue,
chikungunya, and now Zika, pose a public health threat to the US,
particularly Florida, the Gulf Coast states, and Hawaii. Recent
autochthonous transmission of dengue and chikungunya in Florida,
the recent dengue outbreak in Hawaii, and the potential for future
local spread of Zika in the US, has led to the consideration of novel
approaches to mosquito management. One such novel approach, the
release of sterile genetically modified mosquitoes, has been proposed
as a possible intervention, and a trial release of GM mosquitoes is
being considered in one Florida community. However, this proposal
has been controversial. The objective of this research was to increase
understanding of community knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs
regarding mosquito control and GM mosquitoes.  
Methods: An 18­question self­administered survey was mailed to all
households in the identified Key West, Florida neighborhood where a
GM mosquito trial has been proposed. This survey was fielded
between July 20, 2015 and November 1, 2015. The main outcome
variable was opposition to the use of GM mosquitoes. Measures
included demographic information and opinions on mosquitoes,
mosquito control, and vector­borne diseases.  
Results: A majority of survey respondents did not support use of GM
mosquitoes as a mosquito control method.
Discussion: Reasons for opposition included general fears about
possible harmful impacts of this intervention, specific worries about
human and animal health impacts from the GM mosquitoes, and
environmental concerns about potential negative effects on the
ecosystem. Residents were more likely to oppose GM mosquito use if
they had a low perception of the potential risks posed by diseases like
dengue and chikungunya, if they were female, and if they were less
concerned about the need to control mosquitoes in general. These
findings suggest a need for new approaches to risk communication,
including educational efforts surrounding mosquito control and
reciprocal dialogue between residents and public health officials.

Mosquito­borne infectious diseases have been a continual threat to
human health for millennia and, with the recent emergence of Zika
virus, have been recognized more fully as a potential concern in the
US. Myriad types of mosquitoes spread many different pathogens.
Among these mosquitoes the Aedes genus serves as the vector for
several epidemiologically significant infections including dengue fever,
chikungunya, Yellow Fever, and Zika virus.
While mosquito­borne illnesses are often associated with tropical and
sub­tropical climates, the temperate climate of the North American
continent has in the past supported autochthonous transmission of
diseases like malaria and yellow fever.
 Prior to Yellow Fever
elimination efforts, which targeted the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in
the 1960’s, nearly erasing that vector from the Americas, vector­borne
Yellow Fever outbreaks occurred seasonally as far north as Boston.
Since the 1980s, vector control efforts have been cut back, or been
hampered by a lack of effective pesticides, allowing the Aedes
species to return to both North and South America and the
Caribbean.  Revised vector surveillance estimates by the CDC show
that Aedes aegypti is present over a wider geographic area in the US
than previously thought–as far North as New York and Northern
California.  Recently, the Aedes vectors have sparked US outbreaks
of dengue and chikungunya in which local transmission has occurred,
and autochthonous transmission of Zika virus is expected to occur in
the US in the coming months.  Such outbreaks have major public
health and economic implications that have spurred more aggressive
control campaigns in some locations in the Southern US and Hawaii.
In the future, temperature and weather variations have the potential to
further expand mosquito habitat ranges and geographic areas with
favorable conditions for transmission of vector­borne diseases.
Importantly, concerns about the potential for outbreaks of of Zika virus
in the US have grown in recent months, prompting discussion of more

aggressive public health and mosquito control responses in the near
future.
Vector control activities directly aim to reduce target vector species
population numbers. Locales utilize a mix of methods tailored to the
specific environment and the particular mosquito’s unique breeding
and biting behaviors. These activities can include aerial and ground
level insecticide spraying, larvicides, and – crucial to Aedes control –
elimination of mosquito breeding sites through reduction in standing
water.
Effective control of mosquito vectors is difficult to accomplish.
Standing water control measures rely on high community compliance
to achieve meaningful reductions of breeding sites, which are often
located on private property. While this intervention is important for
control, it is usually not sufficient. In addition to elimination of standing
water, insecticides/larvicides have traditionally been a primary method
of mosquito control. However, insecticide use for vector control has, in
some cases, sparked concern amongst populations desiring a less
“toxic” approach.
 The use of some insecticides, like
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (commonly known as DDT) – which
are effective against mosquitoes, but can be toxic to humans and
animals in certain contexts – has diminished.
 Additionally, in recent
years, Aedes mosquitoes in certain regions have become increasingly
resistant to some insecticides, rendering this intervention less
effective.
One novel approach to Aedes control that is increasingly being
considered is the release of genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes to
diminish populations of wild type Aedes mosquitoes.
 This
technology relies on gene­edited male mosquitoes that are rendered
sterile, a characteristic that prevents effective procreation of
mosquitoes by outcompeting wild­type males and thereby diminishing
population size. Releases of such mosquitoes have occurred in
Panama, Brazil, and elsewhere with promising results.
While technologically feasible and seemingly efficacious, GM
mosquitoes have generated controversy (as have other GM products)
and varied safety­related concerns among the general public.

of opposition, and moreover, community member approval is essential
to the success of GM mosquito vector control initiatives.
In order to better understand public perceptions, knowledge and
attitudes surrounding vector control and GM mosquito use, we
surveyed members of one community in Key West, Florida, where a
trial of GM mosquitos is under consideration as a targeted intervention
to reduce Aedes mosquito populations and protect against vector­
borne diseases.
 Findings from this study may help public health
practitioners and policymakers communicate more effectively with the
public around the issue of GM mosquitoes in the future.
Study Design
Residents in one community in the Florida Keys, in which GM
mosquito release is being considered, were surveyed to assess
perceptions, knowledge, attitudes and concerns about the use of GM
mosquitoes to control vector­borne disease. An 18­question survey,
which was developed based on prior surveys and expert opinion,
solicited demographic information and opinions on mosquitoes,
mosquito control, and vector­borne diseases (Appendix 1). The self­
administered survey was mailed to all (456) households in the
identified neighborhood and was fielded between July 20, 2015 and
November 1, 2015. Of the distributed surveys, 53 were returned as
undeliverable. Of the remaining 403 potential household respondents,
22% (n = 89) participated in this study. One response was excluded
since very few questions were answered. A total of 88 responses
were analyzed.
Statistical Analysis
Summary statistics were performed to analyze overall trends in survey
responses. The Wilcoxon signed­rank statistical hypothesis test was
used to assess whether population mean ranks differed between sub­
questions when the survey asked participants to rate different
mosquito control methods. Multiple logistic regression was used to
model opposition to GM mosquitoes on a number of variables,

including demographic information and opinions on mosquitoes,
mosquito control, and vector­borne diseases collected for each survey
respondent. Simple logistic regression was used to evaluate individual
relationships between opposition to GM mosquitoes and collected
opinions and demographic information. An expanded set of plausible
explanatory variables including all variables that showed significance
with simple logistic regression was initially analyzed in a full multiple
logistic regression model, but it was determined that a more
parsimonious model should be explored due to lack of significance for
many variables.
Model selection was done using stepwise selection of variables and
analysis of the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) values. The final
model included 3 variables. Because of the high number of unique
patterns, the Hosmer­Lemeshow goodness of fit test was the primary
regression diagnostic used to show good model fit (p=0.6568). Multi­
collinearity was checked using the “collin” command in STATA, which
displays several measures of collinearity, including variance inflation
factor (VIF). All variables showed low VIF values (from 1.12­2.12) with
a mean VIF of 1.59. Data was missing in a small number of
responses. For variables included in the regression analysis, the
maximum number of missing data points was 6 (6.74%).
Outcomes
The main outcome variable was opposition to the use of GM
mosquitoes. The survey included the question:
“The Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD) is considering
using the mosquito control method of introducing male mosquitoes
that have been genetically modified (GM) to be sterile in order to
reduce the mosquito population in [community]. To what extent do you
support of oppose this mosquito control approach in [community]?”
The question included 5 categories of response, including strongly
support, support, neutral, oppose, and strongly oppose. These
responses were divided into two groups, those who specifically
opposed GM mosquitoes (included: oppose and strongly oppose) and
those who did not (included all other responses), to create a

dichotomous outcome variable. A number of potential independent
variables were explored (Appendix 1). After initial data exploration,
gender; opinions about mosquito nuisance; worry about mosquito­
transmitted diseases; likelihood of contracting those diseases;
limitations placed on outdoor activities; and the need to control the
mosquito population in the community were used as independent
variables in the statistical analysis.
This study was determined to be exempt by the University of
Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (IRB # PRO15060289).
Between July 20, 2015 and November 1, 2015, 89 households in a
Key West neighborhood (22%) responded to our survey. One
insufficiently complete response was excluded. Demographic
characteristic of 88 respondents included in our analysis are reported
in Table 1.

Perceptions about Mosquitoes and Mosquito­borne Diseases
Respondents were asked whether they perceived mosquitoes to be a
nuisance where they live. Forty­nine percent (n=41) of 83
respondents strongly disagreed, disagreed, or were neutral, while
51% (n=42) strongly agreed or agreed that mosquitoes are a
nuisance where they live. Sixty­nine percent of residents (n=60),
reported that they rarely or never limit their time outdoors due to
mosquitos while 9% (n=27) responded that they sometimes or often
limit their time outdoors because of mosquitoes. This question was
followed with a yes/no question about whether there is a need to
reduce the mosquito populations in their community. Most residents
who responded answered “yes” (n=67, 79%)
Participants were also asked about their level of worry about
mosquito­spread diseases like dengue fever or chikungunya. Of the
87 respondents to this question, 32 (37%) reported that they “haven’t
thought about it” or were “not worried at all,” while a majority (n=55,
63%) were either “a little worried” or “very worried.” This question was
followed by a question asking whether residents had known anyone
who had been sick with dengue fever or chikungunya. Of the 87
responses to this question, 65 (75%) answered “no” they hadn’t
known anyone with these diseases, and 22 (25%) answered “yes.”

Residents were then questioned about perceived likelihood that they
or someone they know would contract dengue fever or chikungunya
while living in their community. A large majority (n=75, 85%) of the 88
total respondents to this question thought that it was “very unlikely,”
“unlikely,” or “uncertain” that anyone they knew would contract these
diseases. Only 13 (15%) respondents answered that it was “likely” or
“very likely” to happen.
Perceptions about Mosquito Control Methods
The survey next asked a succession of questions about mosquito
control methods. First, residents were asked to rate a series of
mosquito control methods that might be applicable to their community.
Respondents were asked to rate each question from 1­5 (1 being the
method they supported the most, and 5 being the method supported
the least). Based on the mean score of each control method,
residents were most supportive of the method of “draining standing
water on private property to reduce mosquito breeding” (mean=1.98),
followed by treating standing water with larvicides (mean=2.49),
spraying pesticides at ground level (mean=3.01), spraying
insecticides in the air (mean=3.14), and residents were least
supportive of using “GM sterile male mosquitoes to reduce the
mosquito population (mean=4.14). The difference in distributions of
opinions regarding eliminating standing water from private property
and the use of GM mosquitoes to control the mosquito population was
found to be statistically significant using the Wilcoxon signed rank test
(z=­5.57, p=<0.0001).
Perceptions about GM Mosquitoes
Residents were then asked directly to what extent they support using
GM mosquitoes for control in their community. Of the 86 who
responded, 50 (58%) said they either “oppose” or “strongly oppose”
GM mosquito use, while 36 (42%) were either neutral or “support” or
“strongly support” GM mosquito use for vector control in their
community. The question about GM mosquito use was followed up
with two questions aimed at understanding the reasons behind why
they either supported or did not support this control option. Residents
were asked to check all reasons that applied. For those who

supported or were neutral on GM mosquito use, the survey provided 4
possible reasons for support of this method. Of these reasons for
supporting GM mosquito use, respondents chose one reason most
often: “GM mosquitoes could reduce the need to use
pesticides/larvicides in [community] for mosquito control” (n=24).
Other reasons, including reduction in pesticide­resistant mosquitoes
(n=16) concern about mosquito­transmitted disease (n=15) and
reduction of mosquito nuisance (n=14), were chosen less often (See
Figure 1).

For those residents who did not support GM mosquito use, the survey
provided 7 possible reasons for opposition of this method. Of these
reasons, respondents chose the following reasons most often: “I am
concerned about the overall safety of GM mosquitoes” (n=37);
“Introduction of GM mosquitoes could upset the local ecosystem by
eliminating mosquitoes from the food chain” (n=20); and “The use of
GM mosquitoes could lead to the use of other GMO products in
[community]” (n=19). Other reasons included concerns that the
mosquito could make people sick and/or pass on modified genes to
people and animals, but were chosen less and thus were less
important to the respondents (See Figure 2).

Residents were asked to characterize how much they had read, heard
or seen about the use of GM mosquitoes as a method of mosquito
control prior to receiving this survey. A large majority (n=60, 83%) had
been exposed to this information “some” or “a lot,” while only 12
(17%) of the residents who responded had read, heard, or seen “not
much” or “nothing” on this topic. Finally, the survey asked residents
about their opinion of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District
(FKMCD), which is responsible for mosquito control in the community
of interest. Overall, most (n=74, 87%) respondents’ had either “very
favorable,” “favorable” or “neutral” opinions toward the District, while a
minority (n=11, 13%) had “unfavorable” or “very unfavorable” opinions
of FKMCD.
Characteristics associated with opposition to GM mosquitoes
Beyond summary statistics, we sought to assess relationships
between opposition of GM mosquito use in vector control (dependent
variable) and other demographic factors and opinions. First, simple
regression was used to evaluate individual relationships between
opposition to GM mosquito use and demographic variables. In this
analysis only gender was found to be significantly associated with GM
mosquito opposition at the p<0.05 level (OR=5.0, p=0.001), with
females more likely to oppose use than males.
We then sought to evaluate the relationship between GM opposition
and other questions about mosquito control and risk perception. Using
simple logistic regression, we found significant associations between
GM mosquito opposition and opinions about mosquito nuisance,
worry about mosquito­transmitted diseases, likelihood of contracting
those diseases, limitations placed on outdoor activities, and the need
to control the mosquito population in the community (Table 2). Each of
these variables were negatively associated with GM mosquito
opposition. If residents considered mosquitoes to be a nuisance, if
they worried about dengue and Chikungunya or thought that
contracting those diseases was likely, limited outdoor time because of
mosquitoes or thought that mosquito control was very important, they
were less likely to be opposed to GM mosquitoes. When multiple
logistic regression was applied to the same set of variables, only

gender (OR=7.47, p=0.002) and Disease likelihood (OR=7.47,
p=0.01) had significant associations with GM mosquito opposition at
the p<0.05 level (Table 2).

16/29
Because of the lack of significance for many of the variables in the
initial adjusted model, a subsequent model was developed. The final
model included 3 variables: opinion about the likelihood of contracting
a mosquito–transmitted disease, gender, and opinion about the need
to control the mosquito population in the community. In this final
model, opinion about likelihood of contracting a mosquito–transmitted
diseases (OR=0.31, p=0.001) and gender (OR=6.93, p=0.001) were
both significantly associated with opposition to GM mosquitoes , with
those who considered the likelihood of acquiring a mosquito­borne
disease to be low and females being more likely to oppose GM
mosquitoes. Opinion about the need to control the mosquito
population in the community as a variable was found to be borderline
significantly associated with GM mosquito opposition (OR=0.23,
p=0.055), with those who supported a greater need to control the
mosquito population more likely to support GM mosquitoes (Table 3).

Our work represents a baseline evaluation of the level of support or
opposition to GM mosquitoes in an area in which their use is being
contemplated because of recent experience with both dengue and
chikungunya autochthonous transmission. Importantly, this evaluation
took place during a time period before Zika virus became a concern
and provides foundational information to judge potential changes in
attitudes over time and with the introduction of new concerns about
mosquito borne diseases. Not surprisingly, the general cultural animus
against most things labeled as “genetically modified” extends to
genetically modified mosquitoes. However, the nuances of that
opposition merit further study and incorporation into public outreach,
discussion, dialogue and education efforts surrounding this issue.
Of interest is the marked gender­split with females more likely to be
opposed to the use of GM mosquitoes than males. One hypothesis is
that this stance reflects broader concerns about genetically modified
products that have been shown to be heightened among women, and
potential concerns about possible effects on children and future
generations.
 However, we did not query subjects about the
presence of children in their household. A similar gender­skew has
been found in studies of vaccine acceptance, with females being less
accepting than males.

The finding that a person’s estimation of the likelihood of contracting
dengue or chikungunya strongly influences their acceptance or
rejection of GM mosquitoes as a control option is also of particular
interest. This finding has strong face­validity in that risk perception
strongly influences the countermeasures people will support in a
variety of situations.
 Most of our respondents thought it unlikely that
they or someone they know would contract one of the listed illnesses,
and only a minority of respondents believed local disease
transmission to be risk. This finding is puzzling because dengue and
chikungunya cases have occurred in Key West in recent years. Local
outbreaks have been covered extensively by the local media and the
local community was blanketed with information aimed at community
engagement, as our group noted in a prior study.  It is unclear
whether the knowledge of the prior outbreaks was extinguished in the
minds of many respondents or whether risk perception has just waned
since these cases occurred.
An important extension of this work would be evaluate the impact of
the 2015­2016 Zika virus outbreak in the Western Hemisphere on
awareness, risk perception, and attitudes. Zika is a virus also
transmitted by Aedes type mosquitoes. The Zika virus outbreak,
occurring in a post­West African Ebola context, has received a very
high level of media attention. In Florida, the Governor recently
declared public health emergencies in 4 counties due to Zika
concerns, despite there being no evidence of autochthonous
transmission in the state to date.
 In contrast, no emergency
declarations occurred in 2009, or in subsequent years, when there
has been autochthonous transmission of dengue in several Florida
counties,
 or in 2014, when the first locally acquired chikungunya
case was identified in Florida.
 Zika virus, with its association with
adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes, may change the risk perception
of those that live in Aedes­laden regions. Adverse pregnancy
outcomes might also be a factor in shifting females’ perceptions as
they recalibrate risks of Aedes­associated infections with new
information about Zika and its potential threats to children. In a recent
nationwide survey by Purdue University, 78% of participants
supported the use of GM mosquitoes to fight Zika virus.

Purdue study surveyed a much wider population, it may provide an
indication of potential changes in public support for GM mosquito use
that may emerge as communities face the threat of Zika virus
transmission in their neighborhoods. In contrast however, a different
nation­wide survey published in February by the University of
Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center found that 35% of
respondents believed that GM mosquitoes cause the spread of
Zika,
 a belief which may reduce local support for GM mosquitoes.
Limitations
The primary limitations of this study are a potential for self­selection
bias and non­response bias in the group of respondents. It may be
that individuals who were in greater opposition to or more in support
of GM mosquito use were more likely to respond to this survey. Thus
the survey may not be representative of the beliefs and attitudes of
the community at large. This potential limitation may make this study
more representative of those residents with strong positive or negative
feelings about GM mosquito use. While this is a limitation, the survey
still provides insight into how and why motivated and vocal members
of this Florida community might support or oppose these vector
control options, and can be useful to inform future public health
approaches to gathering support for GM mosquitoes or other
alternative methods of mosquito control.
We present the first community­based survey of resident attitudes
towards GMO mosquitoes in a region of a U.S. state in which Aedes­
associated infectious disease risks are extant. Gender and individual
risk­perception were found to be highly predictive of support or
opposition to GM mosquito use. These findings may help public health
practitioners and policymakers to improve communication and
dialogue with the public around potential use of GM mosquitoes in the
future, which may be increasingly important as new mosquito­borne
threats such as Zika emerge.

• GM mosquitoes could reduce the chance that I or someone I know
or love will get a mosquito­transmitted disease like dengue fever or
chikungunya
• GM mosquitoes could reduce the need to use pesticides/larvicides in
Key Haven for mosquito control
• GM mosquitoes could reduce the emergence of pesticide­resistant
mosquitoes
• Not applicable, I do NOT support the use of GM mosquitoes
17) If you oppose or do not support the use of genetically modified
(GM) mosquitoes in Key Haven, please select the reason(s) for your
opposition from the list below (check all that apply).
• GM mosquitoes could bite me or someone I know or love and cause
them to become sick
• GM mosquitoes might pass on modified genes to the wild mosquito
population
• GM mosquitoes might pass on modified genes to people or animals
• Introduction of GM mosquitoes could upset the local ecosystem by
eliminating mosquitoes from the food chain
• The use of GM mosquitoes could lead to the use of other GMO
products in Key Haven
• I am concerned about overall safety of GM mosquitoes
• Use of GM mosquitoes is unnecessary because dengue and
chikungunya are not serious threats in Key Haven
• Not applicable, I support the use of GM mosquitoes
18) Before today, how much had you read, heard, or seen about the
use of genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes as a method of mosquito
