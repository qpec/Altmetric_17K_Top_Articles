MEDICAL EDUCATION 
Healing Medicine’s Future: Prioritizing Physician Trainee Mental Health 
Kathryn Baker, MD, and Srijan Sen, MD, PhD 
 
Abstract 
In this article, we discuss current perceptions of the model physician and 
how these perceptions conflict with stressful realities of training 
environments and contribute to the staggering rates of burnout and 
depression faced by medical students and residents. We suggest a multi-
tiered interventional approach to address these problems, with 
innovations for individual trainees, programs, institutions, and the health 
care system. Finally, we discuss the medical community’s ethical 
obligations to ensure that it is appropriately and thoughtfully investing in 
the wellness of medicine’s next generations of practitioners. 
 
As they develop educationally and clinically, medical students and residents are also 
cultivating their professional identities. This can be a nebulous process, as our model of 
an ideal physician is not easily defined. In fact, what it means to be a “good doctor” has 
been discussed for decades, with physicians debating how that should be defined, 
assessed, and taught [1]. Reviews of literature on professionalism in medicine have 
identified as many as 90 different attributes [2] and shown that there is no 
comprehensive, universally accepted definition of medical professionalism to date [3]. 
Despite these complexities, professional identity formation is considered an important 
aspect of medical training [4], with trainees forming influential ideals about how they 
should think, feel, and behave as physicians. 
 
As relatively recent residency graduates, we (the authors) run a mental health clinic for 
medical students and residents at the University of Michigan, and we frequently hear the 
trainees speaking in the same language with which we were indoctrinated as trainees. 
Common across their stories seems to be a predominant core belief that one’s own pain 
and suffering, occurring in service to the art or science of medicine, should be quietly 
tolerated. One of us was recently speaking with a resident who shared that the mantra 
among his cohort was to “tough it out” and “power through” any physical or emotional 
suffering. We routinely hear phrases like this, coupled with the fear that to do anything 
else would be to risk being seen by peers and supervisors as weak, vulnerable, or flawed 
in some way [5-7].

A predominant assumption in medicine is that we should be supernaturally resilient [5-
7]. Given the rigors of medical education, residency, and a career in medicine, our ability 
to navigate this journey successfully while remaining psychologically and physically 
resilient is an understandable source of pride. But in harboring this ideal and reinforcing it 
throughout training, do we create a culture in which physicians easily lose sight of the 
fact that we are also human beings subject to illness vulnerabilities, just like the patients 
we treat? Do the stressors of training and their psychological consequences negatively 
impact our ability to be “good” doctors? 
 
Stress, Burnout, and Depression 
Physician trainee mental health has been spotlighted recently in prominent newspapers 
and magazines [8-12] as well as in the academic literature [13-18], suggesting a 
growing interest in challenges that developing physicians face and the consequences of 
those challenges. In their influential systematic review on the topic, Dyrbye and 
colleagues found that medical students consistently demonstrate higher overall 
psychological distress relative to samples of both the general population and age-
matched peers [19]. Moreover, a recent survey suggests that psychological distress 
increases during training itself, because compared to age-similar college graduates, 
matriculating medical students at six US medical schools began their medical education 
with lower rates of burnout (27.3 percent versus 37.3 percent) and depression (26.2 
percent versus 42.4 percent) and higher quality of life scores after adjusting for age, sex, 
relationship status, and race/ethnicity [20]. Factors contributing to psychological 
distress include academic pressures [19, 21-22], financial burdens [19, 21-22], student 
mistreatment [19, 23], and developing professional cynicism [19, 24], to name a few. 
The negative impacts of this psychological distress are exacerbated during residency by 
long hours [25], overnight shifts [26], debt [27], dissatisfaction with lifestyle [28] and 
with job [29], and lack of autonomy [29]. Furthermore, there is little time to develop 
aspects of identity unrelated to medicine that could contribute to a solidly grounded 
sense of self [30], and the quality of relationships that might provide a secure base of 
social support often suffer [31]. 
 
Given these psychological challenges, it is not surprising that rates of burnout and 
depression are high among trainees; the largest multicenter study on resident burnout 
showed rates of 51.5 percent in a sample of 16,192 internal medicine residents in the 
2008-2009 academic year [27]. Medical students and residents also have significantly 
higher rates of burnout and depressive symptoms than population control samples [13]. 
A meta-analysis on resident depression published in JAMA in December 2015 by Mata 
and colleagues revealed an overall prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms of 
28.8 percent in 17,560 resident physicians—with similar rates across specialties, post-
graduate year, and country of practice—and a 15.8 percent median increase in 
depressive symptoms within one year of beginning training in 4,255 resident physicians 
[14]. These findings suggest that residency training is fundamentally stressful and that 
  
 
www.amajournalofethics.org 
606 
residents pay a substantial price in terms of their mental health for enduring this stress. 
Furthermore, the literature has consistently shown a correlation between degree of 
burnout, distress, and fatigue and the frequency of perceived or self-reported medical 
errors [32-35], suggesting that it might not only be the physicians who pay the price, but 
their patients as well. 
 
First in 2003 and then again in 2011, the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical 
Education (ACGME) made efforts to implement duty-hour restrictions in order to foster a 
“humanistic environment” promoting “excellent and safe patient care” [36]. A 
longitudinal cohort study has shown that though these changes have led to a small but 
statistically significant reduction in work hours (from 67.0 to 64.3 hours on average), that 
reduction was not associated with statistically significant changes in sleep, depression, 
or well-being; moreover, there was an unexpected increase in self-reported medical 
errors [37]. In their recent narrative review on resident burnout, Dyrbye and Shanafelt 
argue that “work compression” (a concept previously described as the same workload 
and educational requirements being compressed into a shorter time frame [38]) is 
adding additional stress during the shorter hours such that the net effect of work hour 
restriction on resident mental health is zero [18]. Regardless of its cause, it would seem 
that resident burnout and depression cannot be solved solely by addressing work hours. 
 
The Need for a Multifaceted Interventional Approach 
In order to provide medical training that both prepares trainees to become skilled 
physicians and preserves their mental health in the process, we must implement 
innovative, evidence-based interventions aimed at individual trainees, medical schools 
and residency programs, health care institutions, and educational systems. Despite the 
alarmingly high rates of burnout and depression among medical trainees, they do not 
readily seek appropriate mental health treatment from qualified professionals due, in 
part, to concerns about confidentiality and stigma [39]. Understanding more fully the 
barriers to accessing care and finding solutions to overcome those barriers is essential. 
In our House Officer Mental Health Program at the University of Michigan, faculty 
psychiatrists see residents for a confidential initial evaluation that is not documented in 
their medical charts, offer onsite appointments at the hospital, and hope to soon add 
“after hours” appointments. 
 
Since the stigma of seeking treatment persists, we also need academically rigorous 
research on reasonable alternatives to traditional, in-office psychiatric treatment. 
Finding creative and effective ways for trainees to readily and privately utilize 
multimodal technologies (such as telemental health), and grounding these approaches in 
good science, seems like a worthy investment. For example, a recent randomized clinical 
trial showed that a web-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention for the 
prevention of suicide in medical interns was successful in reducing suicidal ideation [15]. 
However, the interventional literature is lacking in such gold-standard studies and more 
 AMA Journal of Ethics, June 2016 
607 
are clearly needed. A 2014 review and meta-analysis of interventions to reduce anxiety, 
stress, and burnout in physicians initially identified 87 studies, but only 12 were 
methodologically sound enough to be included in the analysis [40]. The interventions 
studied did, however, show promise for cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness-based 
interventions [40, 41]. 
 
Nonclinical interventions could also be useful. Mentorship and coaching programs 
addressing personal and professional development and peer-to-peer support systems, 
such as big/little sibling programs and “process” groups in which residents are 
encouraged to speak candidly about their shared experience, may also provide 
opportunities for therapeutic outreach and open communication. A recent randomized 
controlled trial of facilitated small-group intervention for physicians—with protected 
time to focus on mindfulness, reflection, and shared experience—demonstrated 
significant differences between the intervention and control arms in improvements in 
participants’ ratings of meaning and engagement at work but did not show reductions in 
depression [42], suggesting that small group interventions alone may not be sufficient. 
We could be missing a larger foundational issue associated with the nature of medical 
training by focusing our efforts on treatment of depression, anxiety, and burnout once 
they have developed rather than working to innovate our educational and training 
environments so that they would be less likely to cause these problems in the first place.  
 
In fact, within the past decade attention has been paid to prevention through proactively 
improving wellness as opposed to reactively treating the mental health issues that arise 
during medical training [42-45] and to evaluating the impact of wellness programs. The 
American Medical Association (AMA) recently released a learning module intended to 
provide a framework for developing successful wellness programs; the organization also 
outlined several wellness models that have already been implemented at various 
institutions across the country [43]. These wellness programs could prove to be a 
valuable resource at medical school and graduate medical education levels. The 
Vanderbilt Medical School Wellness Program is the first published model of a 
comprehensive medical student wellness initiative [44], and though subsequent analysis 
of the impact of its programming has not, to our knowledge, yet been published, it did 
show high levels of participation and satisfaction [40]. Other physician wellness 
programs have shown reductions in physical and emotional exhaustion [42] as well as 
stress and anxiety [43]. Although preliminary data is promising, a systematic review of 
13 studies on medical school stress management programs revealed that only one study 
was randomized and considered of very high quality [46]. Evaluating our interventions in 
an academically rigorous way to expand the evidence base will be a critical addition to 
the expanding body of literature on this topic. 
 
Finally, research has also shown that institutions have greater influence than specialty 
on residents’ satisfaction with their learning environment and workload, suggesting that 
  
 
www.amajournalofethics.org 
608 
attention to institutional culture will be critical in improving education and reducing 
burnout and psychiatric illness [47]. The ACGME is paying formal attention to the quality 
of training environments through its Clinical Learning Environment Review (CLER) 
program, which sets an expectation that programs provide education about and 
measurements of burnout annually [48]. It is important not only to track burnout, but 
also to address its underlying causes while offering effective interventions to combat it. 
 
Revisiting the “Good Doctor”: An Ethical Obligation 
Given what we now know about the negative mental health consequences of medical 
training, is it ethical for us to maintain the cultural status quo? Can we provide optimal 
care for our patients when one-third of our trainees are depressed [14] and half are 
burned out [27]? And given that it is fundamentally a healing art that we practice, is it 
ethical to ignore the suffering of our own? Our trainees are intelligent, enthusiastic 
people who begin their journey with lower rates of burnout and depression than age-
matched college graduates [20] but are subjected to environmental stressors in training 
that foster a dramatic prevalence of depression, anxiety, and burnout [13, 14, 19]. If the 
nature of our training contributes to this decline in mental health, is it ethical to ignore it? 
The empirical evidence indicates that residency is fundamentally stressful and has 
negative health consequences for trainees; this demands efforts to fundamentally 
change the system, to promote wellness, reduce illness burden, and improve access to 
effective mental health treatments for our own. We must heal a broken system, each 
other, and ourselves in the process. 
 
In medical schools and residency programs, we need to create a culture in which trainees 
are encouraged to take care of themselves, to recognize when they are struggling, and to 
reach out for support when needed. Our faculty leaders must do their part to 
destigmatize mental illness, promote wellness, and encourage trainees to seek help 
when needed. They should not shy away from talking about resident distress, 
depression, anxiety, and burnout, as these are realities that exist as a part of our current 
training environment [13, 14]. We would go a step further and argue that focusing solely 
on burnout without also discussing depression and suicide, the latter of which are real 
risks for trainees [14, 49-50], might reinforce stigma-driven beliefs that it might be 
acceptable for a trainee to be burned out, but not to have depression. We suggest here 
that an open dialogue about mental illness, appropriately named and discussed, should 
be an expectation for training programs. And, finally, we cannot simply react to these 
difficulties once they have arisen. We also need to proactively address the foundational 
stresses of medical training and promote wellness in trainees. 
 
When we see trainees for treatment in our offices, we see bright, empathic, and 
dedicated men and women who are willing to acknowledge their own suffering and take 
action to ameliorate it. We applaud their introspection and courage and their willingness 
to swim against the predominant cultural stream of “power through” and “tough it out.”

The medical community has now shed light on the realities of the physician training 
experience, and we hope it will continue developing innovative ways to promote 
wellness, positive learning environments, and mental health awareness, and to reduce 
the burden of mental illness in physicians. We must change the way we define what it 
means to be a “good doctor” by acknowledging our humanity and our human 
vulnerabilities, and we must encourage medical students and residents to ally with us to 
become champions in these efforts, advocating for themselves and their futures in 
medicine.
