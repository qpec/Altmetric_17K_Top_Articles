 Abstract
Background: Exercise rehabilitation is highly recommended by current guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular
disease, but its implementation is still poor. Many clinicians experience difficulties in prescribing exercise in the presence
of different concomitant cardiovascular diseases and risk factors within the same patient. It was aimed to develop a digital
training and decision support system for exercise prescription in cardiovascular disease patients in clinical practice: the
European Association of Preventive Cardiology Exercise Prescription in Everyday Practice and Rehabilitative Training
(EXPERT) tool.
Methods: EXPERT working group members were requested to define (a) diagnostic criteria for specific cardiovascular
diseases, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and other chronic non-cardiovascular conditions, (b) primary goals of
exercise intervention, (c) disease-specific prescription of exercise training (intensity, frequency, volume, type, session
and programme duration), and (d) exercise training safety advices. The impact of exercise tolerance, common cardio-
vascular medications and adverse events during exercise testing were further taken into account for optimized exercise
prescription.
Results: Exercise training recommendations and safety advices were formulated for 10 cardiovascular diseases, five
cardiovascular disease risk factors (type 1 and 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia), and three
common chronic non-cardiovascular conditions (lung and renal failure and sarcopaenia), but also accounted for baseline
exercise tolerance, common cardiovascular medications and occurrence of adverse events during exercise testing. An
algorithm, supported by an interactive tool, was constructed based on these data. This training and decision support
system automatically provides an exercise prescription according to the variables provided.
Conclusion: This digital training and decision support system may contribute in overcoming barriers in exercise
implementation in common cardiovascular diseases.

Introduction
Exercise training is a cornerstone in the prevention
and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), as it
leads to reductions in cardiovascular (CV) event
rates, hospitalisations, and improves CVD risk pro-
file, exercise capacity, muscle strength and endurance,
quality of life and life expectancy in patients with
CVD
(risk).1-4
Participation
in
preventive
pro-
grammes for therapy optimisation, adherence and
risk factor management, that include exercise train-
ing, are now recommended for patients with CVD to
reduce
disease
recurrence
by
the
2016
European
guidelines for CVD prevention.5
To facilitate implementation of exercise training
intervention in the treatment of patients with CVD
(risk), clinical recommendations have been published.5
In general, it is recommend that CVD patients should
execute >150 min per week of endurance exercise train-
ing, ideally spread over three to five days per week. It is
advised to initiate the exercise training intervention at a
low(er) exercise intensity, and gradually increase this
intensity. An energy expenditure of 1000–2000 kcal
per week should be achieved, and endurance exercise
training should be complemented by resistance exercise
training two times per week at a moderate exercise
intensity.5
Also,
neuromotor
training
involving
balance, agility and coordination exercise are recom-
mended in specific indications.
However, evidence is accumulating that a different
exercise prescription is required when different goals
are aimed at (e.g. for reducing adipose tissue mass,
improving blood lipid profile, exercise tolerance or gly-
caemic control, etc.) and according to the severity of
CVD.6 For example, it has been shown that in type 2
diabetes patients a higher exercise training frequency is
key to greater clinical benefits (improvement in gly-
caemic control),7 while in patients with symptomatic

 peripheral arterial disease walking, but not cycling,
exercise training leads to improvements in walking cap-
acity.8 Tailoring the exercise training programme to
each single patient according to his/her specificity is
thus a crucial aspect in this endeavour. However, clin-
icians are confronted with the difficulty of properly pre-
scribing exercise in the presence of combinations of
CVDs, CVD risk factors and/or other chronic non-
CV diseases within the same patient, and keeping
patients
adherent
to
the
prescribed
programme.
Indeed, a large heterogeneity in exercise prescription
(exercise type, frequency, volume, intensity, session
and programme duration) has been shown in CV
rehabilitation programmes.9-16
With this in mind, the European Association of
Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) aimed to optimise exer-
cise prescription in patients with different CVDs and
risk factors by the publication of recommendations
for prescription of specific exercise training modalities
for
patients
with
different
CVD
risk
factors
or
CVDs.17,18 However, these recommendations remained
distinct between different CVDs and risk factors. Yet,
the challenge for clinical practice is how to combine
these different exercise training guidelines, taking into
account CV medication intake, presence of common
non-CV co-morbidities, and adverse events during exer-
cise testing, when shaping an exercise prescription for a
single individual. We hypothesised that CV rehabilita-
tion specialists could potentially benefit from a digital
training and decision support system that assists them
in exercise prescription.19 Due to the complexity, such a
tool must be able to define or advise automatically
which
exercise
training
programme
should
be
prescribed.
The aim of the present paper is to describe the con-
cept, definitions and construction methodology of a
digital training and decision support system for exercise
prescription for patients with CVD: the EAPC Exercise
Prescription in Everyday Practice and Rehabilitative
Training (EXPERT) tool. This tool is an interactive,
digital training and decision support system that assists
healthcare professionals to prescribe clinically effective
and medically safe exercise training programmes for
CVD patients. With such a tool, we aim to optimise
exercise prescription for patients with CVD (risk),
and hereby to contribute to increased short- and
long-term clinical benefits.
In this article, the activities and composition of the
EXPERT working group are described, and thereafter
the EXPERT tool construction methodology and use.
Finally, exercise training recommendations for five
imaginary cases (see Appendix 1), as generated by the
EXPERT tool, are compared with exercise training rec-
ommendations
generated
by
18
cardiologists/CV
rehabilitation specialists.
EAPC EXPERT working group
A working group of dedicated and experienced rehabili-
tation specialists from different European countries was
first composed. Not all working group members were
involved in the development of the EXPERT tool from
the beginning. Some members agreed to participate at a
later stage of the project. All contributors were chosen
based on their scientific and/or clinical expertise.
Contributors and collaborations within EXPERT
working group
The EXPERT working group involved 33 experts in the
rehabilitation of chronic internal diseases, and three
computer science experts, from 11 European countries
(see author list).
Specific goals of the EXPERT working group
An interactive digital training and decision support
system for exercise prescription was developed by the
EXPERT project working group, and was endorsed by
the EAPC. The goals of the EAPC are to optimise the
implementation of, to spread scientific knowledge of,
and to educate clinicians in secondary CV prevention.
The following targets in the EXPERT project were
agreed:
1. To design a digital training and decision support
system that assists healthcare professionals to
choose and adopt the most optimal exercise train-
ing intervention for CVD (risk) patients. The tool
should act as a decision support/recommendation
generating system.
2. To develop, validate and implement the digital
training and decision support system as a web-
based application, which assists healthcare profes-
sionals to choose and implement effective exercise
training interventions in CVD (risk) patients.
3. To apply the tool in an educational context. The
recommendations suggested by the tool allow the
training of healthcare professionals to better under-
stand state-of-the-art exercise prescription, and to
promote such prescription by an e-learning plat-
form or educational activities.
4. To update and upgrade this digital training and
decision support system according to new scientific
evidence and to experience emerging from research
and clinical use.
5. By the clinical use of this digital training and deci-
sion support system it is possible to collect large
amounts of data concerning exercise prescription
and changes in CVD risk factors from different
centres. By the analysis of such data, it is possible
Hansen et al.

 to inventory how exercise is prescribed in CV
rehabilitation, and the impact of different exercise
prescriptions on clinical benefits.
Target audience of EXPERT tool
The EXPERT tool is made and designed for cardi-
ologists, physiotherapists, clinical exercise physiolo-
gists
and/or
nurses
specifically
involved
in
CV
rehabilitation. The EXPERT tool may also be used
by sport- and exercise medicine specialists, family
physicians or endocrinologists, although it must be
guaranteed
that the
exercise
training intervention
will be implemented in the proper setting with suffi-
cient and specialised supervision. In the end, the
implementation
of
exercise
training
intervention
remains the full responsibility of the healthcare pro-
fessional, i.e. the generated exercise prescription by
the EXPERT tool must always be evaluated by suf-
ficiently
educated
physicians
or
allied
healthcare
professionals.
Methodology of construction of
EXPERT tool
Contributor tasks
The chronology and passed timelines of EXPERT
working group activities are displayed in Appendix 2.
Working group members were allocated to specific
CVDs, CVD risk factors, or other chronic non-CV co-
morbidities after the first official meeting (see author
list), and were requested to (a) provide definitions or
diagnostic criteria, (b) define the primary goal of exer-
cise training intervention, (c) specify exercise training
recommendations, and (d) indicate exercise training
safety advice. These recommendations and definitions
had to be based on (preferably in following order) cur-
rent clinical guidelines and position statements, meta-
analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled
trials, cohort studies, observational studies or expert
opinions.
These
recommendations
and
definitions
were collected by the project coordinator who collabo-
rated with computer science experts to construct the
EXPERT tool.
Definitions and diagnostic criteria of diseases
and risk factors
The different CVDs, commonly presented chronic non-
CV diseases, and CVD risk factors were defined accord-
ing to international guidelines (see Table 1). These
standards and criteria are also used in the EXPERT
tool.
Exercise intervention goals
For each different CVD, CVD risk factor and other
chronic non-CV co-morbidity, specific exercise inter-
vention goals were formulated (see Table 2). These
goals were selected as they are known to be associated
with clinical status or morbidity/mortality. Exercise
training prescriptions were based on these exercise
intervention goals.
Construction and use of the tool
Step 1: patient characteristics
Clinicians using the EXPERT tool have to fill out the
patient’s name, date of birth, body height and weight
(from which body mass index (BMI) is calculated auto-
matically), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood
total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
concentration, fasting glycaemia, resting and peak
heart rate during exercise testing, and peak oxygen
uptake capacity (from which percentage of reference
value is automatically calculated).36 When certain
thresholds of CVD risk factors are exceeded, these
risk factors are automatically activated (with their cor-
responding exercise prescription). Based on percentage
of normal peak oxygen uptake capacity, clinicians are
alerted to adjust the initial exercise intensity accord-
ingly. Resting heart rate and heart rate during peak
exercise are used for detailed exercise intensity prescrip-
tion (based on the Karvonen formula). If certain data
are not available (e.g. from exercise testing) the
EXPERT tool still functions, but does not take into
account these missing values for the generation of exer-
cise prescription.
Step 2: CVDs, CVD risk factors, and other chronic
non-CV co-morbidities
Clinicians using the EXPERT tool are able to select one
or more of the following CVDs and CVD risk factors:
primary indications for rehabilitation (e.g. coronary
artery disease (with or without percutaneous coronary
intervention
(PCI),
coronary
artery
bypass
graft
(CABG) surgery, or endoscopic atraumatic CABG
(endo-ACAB) surgery, heart failure (with preserved or
lowered left ventricular ejection fraction), cardiomyop-
athy, intermittent claudication, implantable cardiover-
ter defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker, ventricular assist
devices, heart transplantation, valve disease or surgery,
congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension),
CVD risk factors (e.g. type 1 and 2 diabetes, obesity,
hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia/dyslipidaemia). In
addition, clinicians can select one or more chronic non-
CV
diseases
to
fine-tune
the
exercise
training

 Table 1. Definition and diagnostic criteria for diseases and risk factors.
Rehabilitation indication
Diagnosis definition or criteria
Stable coronary artery disease (with indication for
percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary
artery bypass graft)20,21
Significant coronary stenosis in one or more coronary arteries (�50% stenosis), or patients with symptoms of angina
pectoris during exercise, with or without coronary revascularisation by percutaneous coronary intervention or cor-
onary artery bypass graft.
Heart failure22
Typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) and signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pul-
monary crackles, and displaced apex beat) resulting from an abnormality of cardiac structure or function (diminished
cardiac output, diagnosed by echocardiography) due to long-standing hypertension, myocardial ischaemia/infarction,
valve disease, obesity and/or diabetes. Both diastolic (preserved left-ventricular ejection fraction) and systolic (reduced
left ventricular ejection fraction) heart failure are included.
Cardiomyopathy23
In an adult, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is defined by a wall thickness �15 mm in one or more left ventricular myocardial
segments–as measured by any imaging technique (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or computed
tomography), that is not explained solely by loading conditions. Genetic and non-genetic disorders can present with
lesser degrees of wall thickening (13–14 mm); in these cases, the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy requires
evaluation of other features including family history, non-cardiac symptoms and signs, electrocardiogram abnormalities,
laboratory tests and multi-modality cardiac imaging.
Obesity24
Body mass index >30 kg/m2 or (preferentially) a waist circumference >94 cm for males and >80 cm for females.
Type 1 diabetes24
Type 1 diabetes: fasting blood glucose level �125 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l), two-hour glycaemia �200 mg/dl (�11.1 mmol/l) during
oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated haemoglobin �6.5% (48 mmol/mol).
Hyperglycaemia is due to (sudden) pancreatic beta-cell destruction leading to absolute insulin deficiency.
Type 2 diabetes24
Type 2 diabetes: fasting blood glucose level �125 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) two-hour glycaemia �200 mg/dl (�11.1 mmol/l) during
oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated haemoglobin �6.5% (48 mmol/mol).
Type 2 diabetes is characterised by a combination of insulin resistance and beta-cell failure, in association with obesity
(typically with an abdominal distribution) and sedentary lifestyle. Insulin resistance and an impaired first-phase insulin
secretion causing postprandial hyperglycaemia characterise the early stage of T2DM. This is followed by a deteriorating
second-phase insulin response and persistent hyperglycaemia in the fasting state.
Hypertension25
Systolic blood pressure �140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure �90 mm Hg.
Hypercholesterolaemia/dyslipidaemia26
Blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol content �100 mg/dl (2.5 mmol/l) for high risk patients or >70 mg/dl
(<1.8 mmol/l) for very high risk patients.
Pulmonary hypertension27
An increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure �25 mm Hg at rest as assessed by right heart catheterisation.
Intermittent claudication28
The development of symptoms (reduced walking capacity and intermittent leg pain that is provoked by walking) related to
peripheral arterial disease: an ankle-brachial index of �0.8 or the mean of three ankle-brachial indexes of �0.90, or
having undergone peripheral arterial revascularisation.
Pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator
Presence of pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
Ventricular assist devices
Presence of ventricular assist device.
Cardiac transplantation
Presence of transplanted heart.
Sarcopaenia29
Lean tissue mass is less than 20%tile of adult reference values or an appendicular lean mass/height2 of �7.23 kg/m2 in men
and at �5.67 kg/m2 in women.

Rehabilitation indication
Diagnosis definition or criteria
Chronic lung disease30–32
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: people with a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<0.70 and reduced FEV.
Restrictive lung disease: total lung capacity �5th percentile and normal FEV1/FVC.
Idiopathic interstitial lung disease: is a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown
cause, occurring primarily in older adults, limited to the lungs, and associated with the histopathologic and/or radiologic
pattern of a usual interstitial pneumonia. It requires exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease (e.g.
domestic and occupational environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, and drug toxicity), the presence of a
usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on high-resolution computed tomography in patients not subjected to surgical lung
biopsy, and specific combinations of high-resolution computed tomography and surgical lung biopsy pattern in patients
subjected to surgical lung biopsy.
Renal failure (patients on dialysis)33
A glomerular filtration rate level less than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 represents loss of half or more of the adult level of normal
kidney function (renal insufficiency). A glomerular filtration rate less than 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 equals renal failure.
Valve disease/surgery (without coronary
artery bypass graft)34
Aortic valve stenosis: valve area <1.0 cm2, indexed valve area <0.6 cm2/m2 body surface area, mean gradient >40 mm Hg,
maximum jet velocity >4.0 m/s, velocity ratio <0.25.
Mitral valve stenosis: valve area <1.0 cm2, mean gradient >10 mm Hg.
Tricuspid valve stenosis: mean gradient �5 mm Hg.
Valve regurgitation is based on qualitative (valve morphology, colour flow regurgitant jet, continuous wave signal of
regurgitant jet, and other features), semi-quantitative (vena contracta width, upstream vein flow, inflow, and other
features) and quantitative (effective regurgitant orifice area, regurgitant volume, and enlargement of cardiac chambers/
vessels) criteria.
Congenital heart disease35
Atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction, coarctation of the aorta, Marfan syndrome, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction,
Ebstein’s anomaly, tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, transposition of the great arteries,
congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, univentricular heart, patients after Fontan operation, right
ventricular to pulmonary artery conduit, Eisenmenger syndrome and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
In-hospital phase
Being hospitalised for at least three consecutive days.
FEV: forced expiratory volume; FVC: forced viral capacity; T2DM: type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 prescription, such as sarcopaenia, chronic pulmonary
disease or renal insufficiency/failure. The decision to
divide the above-mentioned diseases into primary indi-
cations, CVD risk factors, and other chronic non-CV
co-morbidities may be pragmatic, but it reflects the clin-
ical practice in exercise prescription for CVD (risk) and
increases the feasibility and user experience of the
EXPERT tool.
Step 3: CV medication interactions
Medications with significant repercussions for exercise
prescription
and
performance
are
included:
beta-
blockers (they alter target exercise heart rate), statins
(they may cause myopathy and lower exercise tolerance),
and exogenous insulin administration or oral megliti-
nide/sulfonylurea intake (they increase the risk for hypo-
glycaemia during and after exercise training). Clinicians
using the EXPERT tool have the opportunity to select
these medications so that exercise prescription can be
further adapted according to medication intake.
Step 4: Adverse events during exercise testing
Adverse events during exercise testing that significantly
affect
exercise
prescription,
are
also
taken
into

 account: myocardial ischaemia (in which the myocar-
dial ischaemia threshold should be preferred as upper
exercise intensity threshold), exercise-induced atrial fib-
rillation (altering exercise heart rate or the atrial fibril-
lation threshold should be preferred as upper exercise
intensity marker), and presence of ICD (in which 10–20
beats below the ICD firing threshold should be pre-
ferred
as
the
upper
exercise
intensity
threshold).
Clinicians have the opportunity to select these condi-
tions and the exercise prescription will be further
adapted according to these selections. Furthermore,
cardiopulmonary exercise testing should preferentially
be performed in patients with different CVD risk fac-
tors due to increased test-sensitivity for myocardial
ischaemia and other co-morbidities.
Exercise training recommendations and
exercise safety advices
After execution of these four steps, the EXPERT tool is
ready to generate an exercise prescription aiming to
optimise the clinical benefits and medical safety of exer-
cise training (see Figure 1 and 2). In addition, contra-
indications for certain types of exercise, as well as
which safety precautions should be taken into account,
are clearly mentioned in the advice concerning medical
safety. The safety advice includes which symptoms
during exercise training may be anticipated and how
to monitor these, and how to adapt training modalities
to prevent eliciting/worsening in these symptoms. This
exercise prescription can always be individually tailored
by the clinician, stored and consulted during follow-up.
In addition, web links to the most recent EAPC pos-
ition statements on exercise training and rehabilitation
are provided.
Definitions of different ranges of exercise intensity
that were used in the EXPERT tool are mentioned in
Table 3.37
The interactive EXPERT tool: capturing
user requirements and prototyping
The EXPERT tool guides the user in bringing all con-
tributing factors for the particular patient in perspective
and proposes an adaptable exercise training recommen-
dation. In this way, the EXPERT tool invites the user to
explore possibilities and perform simulations, by show-
ing the effect on the exercise training recommendation of
changing the selections of contributing factors (CVDs,
CVD risk factors, medication, etc.). In short, the envi-
sioned EXPERT tool would function as a training and
decision support system for the rehabilitation expert.
An interactive, semi-functional prototype of the
EXPERT tool, focusing on the overall workflow sup-
ported by the tool and on the initial ‘look and feel’ and
interactivity of the tool, was realised by the Human-

 for the EXPERT group in May 2015 at EuroPrevent
Lisbon and was welcomed by positive comments.
Based on the experts’ feedback, the prototype was fur-
ther elaborated upon to be discussed again with the
members of the EXPERT group in August 2015 at
European
Society

(ESC)
London.
Following this second round of expert feedback in the
EXPERT group meetings, a small-scale formative user
test was organised with local rehabilitation experts of
Jessa Hospital in Belgium and members of the EXPERT
working group. In the local setting, HCI techniques
such as observations and thinking aloud were used to
optimally capture user requirements. Throughout the
prototyping process, attention was given to functional
features of the EXPERT tool, the recommendation
algorithm and user experience. Besides assessing the
overall concept of the EXPERT tool as a training and
decision support system recommending exercise pre-
scriptions for CV rehabilitation, this user testing stage
has allowed us to define and test an initial validation
protocol for the next stages of the project.

 modalities
for
five
imaginary
patient
cases
(see
Appendix 1, leading to 81 valid case comparisons).
This exercise advice was then compared with the
advice from the EXPERT tool. From this comparative
study, it was generally noticed that:
The range in prescribed endurance exercise training
intensity (based on percentage maximal heart rate
(HRmax)) by the clinicians was large, and in 60
patient cases (74% of all cases) the exercise intensity
range did not correspond with the EXPERT tool.
In all 81 cases the patient was required to do strength
training exercises, and we observed that clinicians
proposed this activity in 58 cases (72% of all cases).
In all 81 cases the patient was required to execute add-
itional types of exercises, and we observed that clin-
icians proposed these activities in 20 cases (25% of
all cases).
The recommended minimal programme duration by the
clinicians showed a large range (from three up to 52
weeks) and was often shorter when compared to the
EXPERT tool: in 37 patient cases (46% of all cases)
this was <12 weeks.
The proposed exercise frequency and exercise session
duration corresponded well with the EXPERT
tool prescriptions.
Discussion
In the present article, the concept, definitions and con-
struction methodology of the EXPERT tool, a digital
training and decision support system for optimised
exercise prescription in CVD (risk), has been explained
in detail. Such a description allows future users of the
EXPERT tool to understand the fundamentals of its
function.
The EXPERT tool was developed over a three-year
period. The development phase consisted of (a) the for-
mation of a representative working group, (b) multiple
meetings and discussions in the working group to reach
consensus, (c) the construction of this tool, and (d)
multiple validation phases with further optimisation
of the tool. Eventually, a training and decision support
system for exercise prescription in patients with CVD
(risk) has been developed which automatically activates
CVD risk factors (with accessory exercise prescription)
during input of patient characteristics, and allows clin-
icians to select up to 10 primary indications for
rehabilitation, five CVD risk factors and three chronic
non-CV diseases. It also allows clinicians to select cer-
tain CV medications (with significant impact on exer-
cise prescription) and adverse events during exercise
testing. The tool then automatically calculates the
most optimal exercise prescription (exercise training
intensity, frequency, duration, type, session and pro-
gramme duration, additional exercise training modal-
ities) based on this input, and it generates exercise
training safety advices to optimise medical safety of
exercise training. This exercise prescription can be
changed by the clinician anytime and it allows clinicians
to collect patient data and to review exercise prescrip-
tions
during
follow-up.
It
thus
follows
that
the
EXPERT tool is the first digital system that allows
and generates such detailed and comprehensive exercise
prescriptions for patients with CVD, taking so many
clinical aspects into account, and combining this infor-
mation within one patient. However, in this tool cur-
rently no difference in exercise prescription is being
made between inpatient and outpatient settings, or
between supervised and unsupervised programmes. It
thus follows that clinicians who prescribe exercise
should take these factors and circumstances into
account to optimise medical safety and practical imple-
mentation. Despite the automatic calculation of exer-
cise prescription by the EXPERT tool, it remains the
full responsibility of the clinician to guarantee optimal
medical safety and feasibility of exercise intervention.
The need for the standardisation of exercise prescrip-
tion in CV rehabilitation throughout Europe was further
confirmed by our own study in which exercise prescrip-
tions by 18 CV rehabilitation experts for five imaginary
patient cases were compared with exercise prescriptions
generated by the EXPERT tool. The EXPERT tool
interprets current European exercise recommendations
and expert opinions. It was noticed that the prescribed
exercise intensities by the clinicians were very often
higher or lower, strength training exercises and add-
itional exercise training strategies were prescribed less
frequently, and the rehabilitation programme duration
was often shorter, when compared to the EXPERT tool
advice. It is thus felt that by the implementation and use
of the EXPERT tool, many clinicians will be stimulated
to reconsider their exercise prescriptions.
The next step in this project is the clinical implemen-
tation of the EXPERT tool in CV rehabilitation set-
tings and hospitals throughout Europe. This will
allow the EXPERT working group to collect a large
amount of data on many CVD (risk) patients in
rehabilitation programmes to contribute to further
understanding of current exercise training prescription
in Europe and the expected benefits of the selection of
different exercise training modalities on short- and
long-term clinical outcomes or exercise training adher-
ence/drop-out. As such, these data may lead to refine-
ments of current exercise training recommendations.
Moreover,
it
is
speculated
that
the
use
of
the
EXPERT tool in exercise prescription may lead to sig-
nificantly greater clinical benefits, cost savings and
innovative
approaches
to
exercise
prescription
in

 clinical practice. Since the last decade, technological
progress has led to a ‘revolution’ in rehabilitation medi-
cine: tele-rehabilitation of heart disease patients is a
good example of how the use and implementation of
these new technologies in clinical medicine leads to
better treatment and outcomes.38,39 Another potential
opportunity is thus to implement the EXPERT tool in
such tele-rehabilitation programmes.
Future activities within the EXPERT working group
are anticipated to continue to adhere to the EXPERT
working group goals, such as:
1. Further refinement of the EXPERT tool and imple-
mentation throughout the cardiology community.
To provide a state-of-the-art digital tool for exercise
prescription, it is mandatory to regularly update
exercise training recommendations,
2. Epidemiological European study on (a) current exer-
cise prescription in clinical practice and its agree-
ment
with
clinical
guidelines
(within
different
centres, regions and countries), and (b) the clinical
impact of the EXPERT tool-based cardiac rehabili-
tation vs. usual cardiac rehabilitation.
Such studies are needed to further optimise the con-
struct and design of the EXPERT tool, but also to be
able to examine relations between exercise prescription
and clinical benefits or therapy adherence in various
CVD risk factors and diseases, and to examine whether
a digitally supported exercise prescription eventually
leads to significantly greater clinical benefits and cost
savings, as opposed to current exercise prescription
throughout Europe. Such data can also contribute to
a
further
refinement
of
clinical
exercise
training
recommendations.
One current limitation of the EXPERT tool may be
that it has not yet been thoroughly validated in clinical
practice, although we have compared exercise prescrip-
tions as generated by 18 clinicians with exercise pre-
scriptions as generated by the EXPERT tool. As a
result, efforts should be made to continue executing
such studies with this tool.
In conclusion, optimal exercise prescription remains
a challenge due to the complexity of the combination of
different CVDs or CVD risk factors, the influence of
pharmacological treatment and the presence of chronic
non-CV diseases or adverse events during exercise test-
ing. In this project, an interactive training and decision
support system (the EXPERT tool) was developed with
the aim of assisting healthcare providers to better
achieve this goal. The current article gives a detailed
overview of the concept, definitions and construction
methodology of this tool as well as the results of the
testing in order to provide a clear understanding of its
rationale and function.

(EXPERT) working group activities.
In the working group activities, the following chron-
ology was respected:
1. Project proposal official presentation (EuroPrevent
Rome, May 2013).
2. Steering group formation (June–August 2013).
3. Critical review analysis of the evidences by the
group members (September 2013–February 2014).
Working group members first consulted existing
clinical exercise training guidelines or position
statements, and further considered specific studies
(preferentially meta-analyses, systematic reviews or
randomised controlled trials) analysing the impact
of different exercise modalities on cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs) or CVD risk factors. When no
evidence was found, the working group relied on
expert opinions.
4. Summary of literature outcomes, as delivered by
working group members, by project leader (dis-
cussed
during
EuroPrevent
Amsterdam,
May
2014, and ESC Barcelona, August 2014).
5. Design and development of a preliminary, web-
based, interactive training and decision support
system (by UHasselt research institutes Biomed-
Reval and Expertise Centre for Digital Media –
Human-Computer
Interaction
[EDM-HCI])
(September 2014–February 2015).
6. Presentation of first EXPERT tool prototype to
group members (EuroPrevent Lisbon, May 2015).
7. Pilot test phase of implementation and usability of
the first prototype by steering group members: data
on feasibility was collected (June–July 2015).
8. Presentation of updated EXPERT tool to group
members (ESC London, August 2015).
9. Design of a more advanced version of the web-
based, interactive EXPERT tool, developed as a
digital training and decision support system for stu-
dents and healthcare professionals in exercise train-
ing of CVD (September–December 2015).
