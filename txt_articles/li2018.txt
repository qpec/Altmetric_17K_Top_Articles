ABSTRACT: Despite its emerging significant public health concern,
the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in urban air has not
received significant attention. Here, we profiled relative abundances
(as a fraction, normalized by 16S rRNA gene) of 30 ARG subtypes
resistant to seven common classes of antibiotics, which are quinolones,
β-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides,
and vancomycins, in ambient total particulate matter (PM) using a
novel protocol across 19 world cities. In addition, their longitudinal
changes in PM2.5 samples in Xi’an, China as an example were also
studied. Geographically, the ARGs were detected to vary by nearly
100-fold in their abundances, for example, from 0.07 (Bandung,
Indonesia) to 5.6 (San Francisco, USA). The β-lactam resistance gene
blaTEM was found to be most abundant, seconded by quinolone
resistance gene qepA; and their corresponding relative abundances
have increased by 178% and 26%, respectively, from 2004 to 2014 in Xi’an. Independent of cities, gene network analysis
indicates that airborne ARGs were differentially contributed by bacterial taxa. Results here reveal that urban air is being polluted
by ARGs, and different cities are challenged with varying health risks associated with airborne ARG exposure. This work
highlights the threat of urban airborne transmission of ARGs and the need of redefining our current air quality standards in
terms with public health.
■ INTRODUCTION
The world is currently facing a serious health threat resulting
from both increasing antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB)
infections and the multienvironmental spreading of antibiotic
resistance genes (ARGs). For example, global mortality
attributable to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is estimated to

 be near 700 000 per year, and is expected to rise to 10 million
annually by 2050.1,2 Major known contributors for AMR include
animal husbandries, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs),
and hospitals.3−8 In addition to their self-inheritance, ARGs can
be acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from one
bacteria to another; or from the environmental to human-related
commensals and other bacteria with the assistance from mobile
genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids, intergrons,
transposes, and prophages.5,9−15 Previous studies showed a
strong correlation between ARGs and intI1 (class 1 integron-
integrase gene) in both natural and built environments,14,15
which implies a potential for environmental AMR transfer and
its impact on health.
Over the years, evidence for ARG presence and transmission
in various environments is accumulating. For example, Levy et
al. (1976) have earlier confirmed the spread of antibiotic-
resistant plasmids in Escherichia coli from chicken to chicken and
from chicken to human.9 Zhu et al. (2017) investigated diverse
and abundant ARGs in the sediments collected from 18 estuaries
located 4000 km off the coast of China, and detected more than
200 ARG subtypes.15 Airborne pathogens in hospital environ-
ments are frequently found to be multidrug-resistant,4 which
could pose a significant health risk to inhabitants even outside
hospitals via airborne transmission.16 Recently, there is an
intense interest of studying the presence of ARGs and MGE
genes in airborne PM in both occupational (e.g., hospitals, cattle
feed yards, wastewater treatment plants, etc.) and urban
environments.8,17−23 Near concentrated animal feed operations,
Ling et al. (2013) detected tetracycline resistance genes of tetX
(100−200 copies/m3) and tetW (100−400 copies/m3) in
human-occupied indoor environments in Colorado.17 Li et al.
(2016) reported relative abundances of sul2 to sulfonamides and
intI1 in the air samples collected from a WWTP in Beijing.19
Echeverria-Palencia et al. (2017) also detected airborne blaSHA
(up to 102 copies/m3) to β-lactams and sul1 (up to 103 copies/
m3) in urban parks in California.20 By reanalyzing the reported
sequence data, Pal et al. (2016) indicated that bacterial biota in
Beijing smog harbored a higher richness of 64.4 ARG types than
other environments, for example, 38.9 for pharmaceutically
polluted environments, 19.4 for wastewater/sludge, 11.8 for
animals, 1.0−16.6 for humans and 1.6−3.3 for other terrestrial
sources.8 Hu et al. (2018) speculated that on highly polluted
days the airborne particles might provide more adhesion sites
which allow microbes to suspend more stably in the air.22 These
studies suggested that, in addition to other routes, airborne
transmission may play an active role in environmental spread
and exposure of antimicrobial resistance. Evidences show that
such a risk varies with cities with differing antibiotic usages. For
example, Pal et al. (2016) observed comparable relative
abundances of ∼0.2 ARGs per 16S rRNA gene in ambient PM
in Beijing, New York and San Diego, but about 5−8 times higher
richness of ARG types detected in Beijing.8 Using real-time
qPCR technique, Echeverria-Palencia et al. (2017) found that
the relative abundances of PM-borne ARGs in Los Angeles were
approximately an order of magnitude lower than those in San
Diego, Bakersfield and Fresno.20 Hu et al. (2018) pointed out
that in addition to different antibiotic usages, physicochemical
factors, meteorological parameters and bacterial communities
also affected the distribution patterns of PM-borne ARGs.22
Unfortunately, such information on airborne ARGs for geo-
graphically, culturally, and economically disparate cities on a
global scale is substantially lacking and their health impacts are
unknown.
On the other hand, current air pollution health studies rely
heavily on PM mass concentration, without considering
biological parameters such as ARGs or ARB. In addition to
long-range transport, varying levels of airborne ARGs in
different cities with different antibiotic use patterns could create
different exposure and transfer risks. The major objective of this
study is to advance the knowledge of urban airborne ARGs
through a novel global survey. We aim to document the spatial
and temporal differences in the relative abundance profiles of
ARGs in the air of different world cities, to determine the
dominant ARG types, and to detail the airborne bacterial taxa
that host the ARGs. Global information on the abundance and
types of ARGs in ambient air is of great value in understanding
current infectious disease transmission and providing valuable
information for re-evaluating air quality assessment practice.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample Collection and Pretreatment. To study the
spatial variation of airborne ARGs on a global scale, we
employed a previously established automobile air conditioning
(AC) filter method24 to obtain ambient total particulate matter
(PM) samples from 19 cities situated in 13 countries across the
globe under eight different climate zones (Figure 1). A total of
174 used AC filters were collected from randomly selected
automobiles regardless of time or season from the year 2016 to
2017. Although there were some differences among the AC
filters resulting from different automobile and/or filter brand,
the filters will likely behave similar in terms with filtration
efficiency as the PM accumulates over time. Here, the PM
samples were first shaken from the AC filters onto a piece of
white office paper, then poured into a 50 mL centrifuge tube

 (Corning Premium Quality, Acton, MA), subsequently followed
by a gravimetrical weight analysis using an analytical balance
(AL204IC, Mettler Toledo, Inc., Greifensee, Switzerland). The
tubes containing the PM samples from the AC filters were then
extracted by corresponding needed volumes of sterile deionized
(DI) water (Milli-Q, Millipore, Billerica, MA) to obtain the PM
extraction samples which had a PM concentration of ∼1 mg/
mL. The PM extraction solutions were further treated by
vigorous vortexing for 15 min at a rate of 2800 rpm and then
stored at −20 °C until subsequent experiments. As for the
quality control, the same type of white office paper was used
together with a new AC filter (purchased in Beijing, China) to
perform the same procedures described above including
dumping PM, pouring DI water and the extraction processes.
The obtained 50 mL tube containing the DI water poured inside
was used as a negative control.
We additionally investigated the relative abundance profiles of
ARGs in PM2.5 samples available for a 10-year time span in Xi’an,
a northwestern city of China. The PM2.5 samples were collected
over the years at an urban monitoring site located on the rooftop
(∼10 m above the ground) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’
Institute of Earth Environment building (E 108.887°, N
34.229°), surrounded by a residential area of ∼15 km south of
downtown Xi’an. A portable atmospheric particulate matter
sampler, MiniVol Tactical Air Sampler (TAS) (Airmetrics, Inc.,
Springfield, Oregon, USA), with a sampling flow rate of 5 L/min,
was used to collect predefined 24-h PM2.5 samples every day.
PM2.5 samples were collected onto quartz filters (47 mm,
Whatman QM/A, England), which were presterilized by baking
at 780 °C for 3 h prior to use. Each filter sample was sealed and
stored at −20 °C until pretreatment for further analysis. A total
of 72 quartz filter samples, respectively, from 6th or 7th, and
25th of each month (January to December) in 2004, 2009, and
2014 as listed in Supporting Information (SI) Excel file S1 were
selected and analyzed. The PM2.5 samples were extracted from
quartz filters by the following procedure. First, a certain fraction
(the analyzed deposition) (see SI Excel file S1) of each of the
filters was cut out using a sterile cutter. Next, each filter fraction
cut was placed together with 2 mL of sterile purified water
(Milli-Q, Millipore, Billerica, MA) with 0.05% Tween 20
(Solarbio, Inc., Beijing, China) into in a sterile centrifuge tube
(Corning Premium Quality, Acton, MA), then subjected to 20
min of sonication, and followed by vortex mixing (Vortex genie-
2, Scientific Industries, Inc., NY) for 40 min at a speed of 2800
rpm. PM2.5 extraction samples were stored at −20 °C until
further experiments.
Detection of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) in
Air. In this work, a total of 39 ARG subtypes conferring
resistance to 7 types of common antibiotics such as quinolones,
β-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, aminoglyco-
sides, and vancomycins, and two mobile genetic element
(MGE) genes including tnpA encoding transposase and intI1
encoding integrase class I were screened by a high throughput
real-time qPCR platform (Wcgene Biotech, Inc., Shanghai,
China) in each city’s PM extraction solution with a
concentration of 1 mg/mL. For PM2.5 samples collected in
Xi’an, a total of 37 ARG subtypes resistant to β-lactams,
quinolones, macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and amino-
glycosides, and 2 MGE genes of tnpA and intI1 were screened.
PM2.5 extraction samples were respectively grouped by year
(2004, 2009, 2014), and pooled together by season (Spring:
March, April, and May; Summer: June, July, and August;
Autumn: September, October, and November; and Winter:
December, January, and February) for analysis. There were six
samples in each group, as shown in SI Table S1. Samples from
each group were pooled as a single sample with the same
concentration. In doing so, we have obtained a total of 12 such
mixed samples as listed in SI Table S1, respectively, representing
the four seasons from the three mentioned years. Here, we
analyzed the ARGs in Xi’an’s ambient PM2.5 samples and global
ambient PM samples in two separate sequence batches with
slightly different target ARG types.
DNA extractions of samples were performed according to the
manufacture’s guidelines as recommended by the SoilPure kit
(DL127−01, Biomed, Inc., Beijing, China). The previously
reported primer sets7,25 as listed in SI Excel file S2 were used in
this work for screening target resistance genes. The qPCR assay
was carried out in a 10 μL volume containing 0.5 μL of template
DNA, 5 μL of Roche FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master
(ROX) (Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Basel, Switzerland), 3 μL of
ddH2O, 0.75 μL of each primer (10 μM each) using a ViiA7 real
time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA),
with a threshold cycle (CT) of 40 used as the detection limit. In
addition to ARGs and MGE genes, the sequences of primers
for 16s rRNA gene were as follows: forward primer: 5′-
GGGTTGCGCTCGTTGC-3′, reverse primer: 5′-ATG-
GYTGTCGTCAGCTCGTG-3′ (Wcgene Biotech, Inc., Shang-
hai, China). Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10
min, followed by 40 cycles of (95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s),
last 72 °C for 10 min. The DI water from the control tube
described above was used as a negative control for all qPCR
assays and all their threshold cycles were under the detection
limit. Here, we used the 2−ΔCT values26 to compare relative
abundances of ARGs between different samples:

where CT, (ARG) and CT, (16s rRNA) are the threshold cycles,
respectively, for ARG subtypes and 16s rRNA genes from typical
qPCR experiments.
Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing. For bacterial
community analysis, a total of 19 samples for all cities’ ∼1 mg/
mL of PM extraction solution from automobile AC filters as well
as all of the 72 Xi’an PM2.5 extraction samples were studied by a
16S rDNA bacterial amplicon sequencing by the Illumina Miseq
2 × 300 bp sequencing platform (Sangon Biotech, Inc.,
Shanghai, China) with a sequencing depth of 20, 000 reads
per sample. The V3−V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was
chosen to amplify with the forward primer 341F
(CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and the reverse primer 805R
(GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC). Details on sample prep-
aration and sequencing were also provided in SI Section S1.
Statistical Analysis. Heat maps for relative abundance
profiles based on the 2−ΔCT values of ARGs were generated by
HemI 1.0 according to a previous reference.27 Network analysis
based on Spearman’s rank correlations was used to visualize the
co-occurrence of airborne subtypes internally and with bacterial
communities, and analyzed in the R software environment
according to the method described previously.28 Network
visualization was conducted using the interactive platform of
Gephi29 with Fruchterman Reingold placement algorithm.30
One Way ANOVA and Paired t test were respectively performed
using Sigma Plot 12.5 (Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL) to
compare the relative abundances of ARGs among different
seasons and those between 2004 and 2014. Wilcoxon signed
rank test was used using Sigma Plot 12.5 to compare the PM2.5
concentrations between 2004 and 2014 because the correspond-

 ing data were not Gaussian-distributed. Alpha diversity was
calculated in Mothur 1.30.1 according to the literature by
Schloss et al. (2009)31 for bacterial community richness (Ace
and Chao) and diversity (Shannon and Simpson) based on a
similarity confidence level of 97%. Nonmetric Multi-Dimen-
sional Scaling (NMDS) based on Bray−Curtis distance was
used to compare bacterial community structures among
samples. Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) was used to compare
the variations in bacterial community structures among two or
more PM sample groups statistically. NMDS and ANOSIM
were performed by R software (version 3.2) with the vegan
package 2.0−10. A p-value of 0.05 indicates a statistically
significant difference in all statistical analyses.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Spatial Variations of Airborne ARGs and MGE Genes
Observed Across Different Geophysical Locations. In this
work, a total of 39 ARG subtypes were analyzed, but only 30
ARG subtypes were detected in airborne particulate matter
collected from 19 global cities as marked in Figure 1. Figure 2 a)
shows relative abundances of ARG subtypes grouped into the
seven primary antibiotic types and ARG subtype richness in
ambient PM for different cities. Beijing was found to have the
highest richness (up to 18 subtypes) of airborne ARGs,
accounting for 60% of total detected ARGs; while the ambient
PM in Bandung was found to contain only 5 subtypes of ARGs
(Figure 2 b)). As shown in Figure 2a), the genes providing
resistance to β-lactams (0.03−5.6, normalized by 16S rRNA
gene, hereafter) and quinolones (0.02−0.05) were the top two
most abundant types of ARGs in all 19 cities, followed by
macrolide (5.2 × 10−5−5.1 × 10−2), tetracycline (1.9 × 10−4−
5.2 × 10−3), sulfonamide (4.2 × 10−5−9.1 × 10−3), amino-
glycoside (2.9 × 10−5−2.9 × 10−3), and vancomycin (2.5 ×
10−5−7.1 × 10−4). These results agreed with a previous
independent study which showed that β-lactam resistance
genes also predominated in Beijing smog.8 The relative
abundance of β-lactam resistance genes detected here varied
by over 2 orders of magnitude across different cities, with the
highest abundance observed for San Francisco (Figure 2 b)). In
contrast, Johannesburg (0.03), Zurich (0.04), and Hong Kong
(0.04) had the lowest relative abundances of airborne β-lactam
resistance genes. If all detected types of resistance genes
considered, airborne ARGs were found to be the most abundant
for San Francisco (5.6) and the least for Bandung (0.07) as
observed in Figure 2 a). The detected airborne ARGs could be
due to the direct emission of ARGs-carrying bacteria or their
reaerosolization due to natural winds or various ground human
activities from urban city environments.
The above ARG results reflect previously reported resistance
patterns of isolated pathogen strains in hospitals. For example,
early in 1996−1999, resistance rates to ceftazidime (cepha-
losporins), which can be used as the proxy for inducible and
extended-spectrum-β-lactam, of Enterococcus cloacae and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in San Francisco County, were
at 39% and 13%, respectively.32 In a 2015 inpatient data set from
346 U.S. hospitals, the nonsusceptible rates of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin (quinolones), ceftazi-
dime (cephalosporins, hereinafter), cefepime, meropenem, and
piperacillin/tazobactam were, respectively, up to 33.6%, 19.4%,
19.8%, 20.9%, and 14.0%.33 As such, in 2012 in the U.S., an order
for limiting the use of cephalosporin was enacted into law.34 It is
reasonable to conclude that the antibiotic use patterns for
different antibiotic types are responsible for the variations in the
relative abundance distribution of airborne ARG types. Through
reanalyzing the existing global antibiotic drug consumption data
by five major common types (no detailed data for their
subtypes) including β-lactams, quinolones, macrolides, tetracy-
clines, and aminoglycosides,35 we found a positive linear
correlation (Pearsons’ r = 0.989, p-value = 0.001) between the
global relative abundances of airborne ARGs detected and the
above five antibiotic drug hospital consumption data as shown in
Figure 2 c). This ARG relationship with human consumption
stems from the fact that the global PM was collected via
automobile AC filter mainly inside the cities where other ARG

 emission sources such as agriculture lands, wastewater treatment
plants and also animal feeding houses are fewer or located in the
suburbs. Accordingly, different practices for controlling the
antibiotic use for urban hospitals could significantly affect the
emissions of ARGs into the air, thus consequently on the health
and environment in an urban city.
The relative abundances of ARGs divided into 30 subtypes
and two MGE genes such as TnA genes and intI genes for each
of the 19 cities are shown in Figure 3a) and Figure 3b),
respectively. As observed in Figure 3a), qepA (ciprofloxacin,
etc.) and blaTEM (cephalosporins especially in β-lactams, such
as ceftazidime, cefepime, etc.) were found to dominate the
ARGs detected for all cities. Such results are expected as genes of
blaTEM and qepA have been previously observed to be
widespread and abundant across various external environments
such as sediment, water, soil, mine, wastewater/sludge,
pharmaceutical pollution, and high pollution atmosphere.8,36
In comparison with natural environments, macrolide and
tetracycline resistance genes are more abundant in the human
microbiome.8 However, the distribution patterns of airborne
macrolide and tetracycline resistance genes varied greatly with
cities as observed in Figure 3a), and did not correlate with the
population. This observation was obviously expected as people’s
drug use preference, health conditions and so on can differ for
different cities. The relative abundances of sulfonamide
resistance genes in Shanghai (9.1 × 10−3), Beijing (2.8 ×
10−3) and Johannesburg (1.6 × 10−3) were found to be 1−2
orders of magnitude higher than those in other cities (4.2 ×
10−5-7.8 × 10−4). The results indicate that ARG emissions from
certain occupational environments such as wastewater treat-
ment and pharmaceutical plants in or near these cities deserve a
particular attention since sulfonamide resistance genes were
much more frequently detected in these places.7,8 It is certainly
alarming that ARGs providing resistance to vancomycins,
though at low levels (2.5 × 10−5−7.1 × 10−4), were also
detected in PM samples collected from Beijing, Haikou,
Chennai, Melbourne, Paris, and Johannesburg. Vancomycin
has so far been considered to be the most powerful antibiotics

abundances based on 2−ΔCT values.

 and is the last resort to clear methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) that is causing 80−90% of hospital-acquired
infection cases and emerging to resist nearly all current common
antibiotic classes.3,37−40
On another front, MGEs were considered to contribute
significantly to the evolution and proliferation of multiple
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.5,9−15 Here, both airborne intI1 and
tnpA encoding MGEs were detected in 18 of 19 cities studied,
with an exception for Melbourne as shown in Figure 3b).
Expectedly, airborne intI1 was found to be more abundant (9.52
× 10−5−1.25 × 10−2 across 18 of 19 cities) than tnpA (5.54 ×
10−5−1.26 × 10−3 across 4 of 19 cities). IntI1, the class 1
integron-integrase gene, is the most widespread and abundant
MGE gene detected across various environments including
human microbiome, animal-associated environments, sediment,
water, soil, mine, wastewater/sludge, pharmaceutical, and
ambient PM pollutants.8 One recent study indicated that IntI1
might play a diluting role in horizontal gene transfer across the
land use gradients, for example, from rural to urban and
industry.23 Our results indicate that airborne PM is carrying the
ARGs that are emitted from various environments, and further
transported to other places through the atmospheric movement.
The potential integration and subsequent expression of these
ARGs in different receptors such as humans and ecology lands
can have serious societal consequences. For example, these
ARBs could be subsequently dispersed among people as
indicated in a previous study.41 The observed different levels
of airborne ARG subtypes and MGEs as shown in Figure 3
implied different spreading potentials of airborne ARGs in
different cities, accordingly representing different exposure risks
for health and ecology.
Bacterial Genera and ARG Co-Occurrences Regardless
of Geophysical Locations. In this work, we have also analyzed
the bacterial communities associated with the airborne ARGs
detected for different cities. Figure 4 shows the co-occurrence
network of airborne ARG subtypes (a) and associations between
ARG subtypes and 50 most abundant bacterial genera (b) based
on statistically significant correlations (Spearman’s rank
correlation analysis, p-value < 0.05). The relative abundances
of bacterial communities at the genus level for each city are
presented in SI Figure S1. The size of each node in Figure 4 is
proportional to the number of connections, and the thickness of
each edge (connection) between two nodes is proportional to
the value of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (r)
according to a previous reference.42 As seen in Figure 4a),
there are 24 nodes and 37 edges with Spearman’s r-values
ranging from 0.46 to 1.00, and all associations presented here are
statistically significant (p-values < 0.05). According to Newman
(2006),43 the modularity calculated by Gephi-0.9.2 is 0.441,
suggesting that the network could be classified into 6 modules.
As shown in Figure 4, both Module I and II were the largest
modules totally accounting for 50% of the whole co-occurrence
pattern while Module III accounted for 16.67% of the ARG co-
occurrence. The genes of blaCMY2, ermT/tetK, and ermF were
the respective hubs for the Modules I, II, and III. The hubs
detected here show other related co-occurring ARG subtypes in
each module that share the same bacterial communities as their
likely hosts.28 For example, the hub of ermF encoding resistance
to macrolides in the Module III can be the indicator of the genes
of ermX (macrolides), sul2 (sulfonamides) and aac(6′)-Ib
(aminoglycosides) in airborne PM. The results here suggest
that these four genes may be statistically associated with the
same host bacteria across different cities, and thus possibly can
be used as indicators for the airborne 24 ARG subtypes detected.
The detected ARGs were found to be associated differentially

Figure 4. Figure 4b) shows 43 nodes and 38 edges with
Spearman’s r-values ranging from 0.46 to 0.64, and all
associations presented in Figure 4a) are statistically significant
(p-values < 0.05). Data in Figure 4a) reveal potential host
information for the ARGs in complex airborne PM. This also
means that the ARGs and their host bacterial taxa might share
similar trends on the relative abundances among different
cities.22,28,44 As shown in Figure 4b, the gene of aac(6′)-II
encoding resistance to aminoglycosides was found to have
significant associations with seven bacterial genera including

 Brevundimonas, Gemmatimonas, Spartobacteria, etc. The genes of
tetO (tetracyclines) and qepA (quinolones) were also associated
with five and four different bacterial genera, respectively. It is
interesting to note that the MGE gene of tnpA was found to be
associated with Kocuria, Belnapia and Paracoccus in the airborne
microbiota. Among others, the Gemmatimonas genus was shown
to be associated with the most ARG subtypes including the most
dominant ARG of blaTEM as well as aac(6′)-II, qnrB and tetW,
while Microvirga was significantly associated with both the two
dominant ARGs, blaTEM and qepA. Unlike Gemmatimonas and
Microvirga, the Spartobacteria genus was shown to be
predominantly associated with aminoglycoside resistance
genes as it was only significantly associated with the genes of
aac(6′)-II and aac(6′)-Ib. On the other hand, the Hymenobacter
genus was shown to be predominantly associated with
tetracycline resistance genes. Particularly, the dominant
bacterial genus in air, Pseudomonas, consisting human
opportunistic species, was detected to be significantly associated
with the macrolide resistance gene of ermA, suggesting
Pseudomonas might contribute to the dissemination of ermA
gene. These results collectively imply that airborne PM
containing different bacterial community structures from
different cities could impose significantly different AMR
exposure health risks.
Significant Temporal Variations Detected for PM2.5-
borne ARGs and MGEs over the Past Decade. To further
examine the longitudinal dynamics of airborne AMR, we
investigated whether such a risk has increased over the past
years. As an example, we studied a total of 37 ARG subtypes in
Xi’an, but only detected 22 ARG subtypes in PM2.5 samples that
are available for analysis from 2004, 2009, and 2014. Figure 5a)
indicates the patterns and degrees of enrichments of ARGs in 6
types as well as in the total ARGs across different seasons in
2004, 2009, and 2014 in Xi’an. In general, the relative
abundances of PM2.5-borne ARGs in summer (0.86 ± 0.20,
average ± standard deviation, hereafter) were the highest among
all seasons (p-value = 0.023, One Way ANOVA), followed by
winter (0.63 ± 0.15), spring (0.42 ± 0.07) and fall (0.40 ± 0.33).
It was observed here that from the year 2004 to 2014, the relative
abundances of total ARGs in PM2.5 increased in all seasons (by
57% in summer, 60% in winter, 32% in spring, and 2,486% in
autumn). Statistical analysis shows that the relative abundances
of PM2.5-borne ARGs in 2014 were significantly higher than
those a decade ago in Xi’an (p-value = 0.041, Paired t test).
However, there was no significant difference detected in the
PM2.5 concentrations between 2004 and 2014 (p-value = 0.157,
Wilcoxon signed rank test), implying that the differences are
taking place in ground-based human activities that involve use of
antibiotics.
The relative abundances of ARG subtypes and spreading
potentials were also detected to have evolved, for example, in
Xi’an, in this work. The ARG subtypes classified into six types
and MGE genes were respectively shown in Figure 5b) and
Figure 5c) for different seasons of 2004, 2009, and 2014. The
ARGs of qepA (0.322 ± 0.144) and blaTEM (0.183 ± 0.118),
respectively, providing resistance to quinolones and β-lactams
were found to be the top two abundant ARG subtypes over the
past decade in Xi’an (Figure 5b). From the year 2004 to 2014,
the relative abundances of qepA and blaTEM had respectively
increased by 26% (p-value = 0.483, Paired t test) and 178% (p-
value = 0.008, Paired t test). This observation corresponds well
with the findings in Sun and Wang (2012) that the daily defined
doses (DDDs) of the levofloxacin (quinolone) and cepha-
losporins (β-lactam) were reported to have respectively
increased by 109% and 427% from the year 2008 to 2010 in
Xi’an Huashan Central Hospital.45 The gene of blaTEM,
typically encoding resistance to cephalosporins, was recently
found to be prevalent in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter
baumannii isolates (33.33%) and third generation cephalospor-
ins-resistant Enterobacteriaceae including Acinetobacter spp.
(25.9%) and Klebsiella spp. (30.6%).46−48 These species are all
critical priority pathogens according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) global priority pathogens list.49 Interest-
ingly, the MGE genes of intI1 were detected in all PM2.5 samples,
while tnpA was only found for the spring of 2009 as shown in
Figure 5c). Statistically, our study suggests that during the past
decade, the abundances of urban ambient PM2.5-borne ARGs
have increased due to changes from the ground human activities,
for example, hospital usages of antibiotics. Increases in
abundances of airborne ARGs inevitably could lead to increased
“second-hand” inhalation risk of ARGs for city inhabitants.
Different from the chemical products, ARGs could transmit
among people as well as bacterial species, thus increasing the
susceptibility of humans or the environment to bacterial
resistance. The results from Xi’an here also indicate that such
a threat has actually increased over the past decade.

 Temporal Variations of PM2.5-Borne Bacterial Com-
munity during the Past Decade: Potential Impacts from
AMRs. As an example for potential influences of ARGs, we have
investigated the changes in PM2.5-borne bacterial community
structures in Xi’an. We sequenced all the PM2.5 samples in two
batches, respectively, the group from summer grouped with
winter, and that from spring grouped with autumn; however,
there was an unidentified error for the sequencing process
regarding the group of spring and autumn samples. Thus, here
we only show the results for the groups of summer and winter
PM2.5 samples. Phylogentic compositions of PM2.5-borne
bacteria at the genus level and corresponding nonmetric
multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses for summer and
winter among 2004, 2009, and 2014 were provided and analyzed
as shown in Figure 6a) and Figure 6b), respectively. The
statistics reflecting alpha diversity such as Ace, Chao, Shannon,
and Simpson were listed in SI Excel file S3. Interestingly, we have
detected significant differences in the airborne bacterial genus
structures for winter seasons for 2004, 2009, and 2014
(ANOSIM, hereinafter, R = 0.2, p-value = 0.002) as shown in
Figure 6 b); whereas the interdecadal change in bacterial genus
structures for summer was not statistically significant as seen in
Figure 6 b) (p-value = 0.3). In winter, both PM2.5-borne
bacterial community richness and diversity had increased during
the past decade (SI Excel file S3). For both winter and summer,
the bacterial structures for 2004 and 2009 were statistically
separated as seen in Figure 6 b), implying that significant
differences have taken place with respect to bacterial emissions
from the ground from the year 2004 to 2009. For genus level,
compared to earlier years, the average relative abundances of
Faecalibacterium and Methanosarcina in the year 2009, and those
of Delftia, Serratia, and Raoultella in the year 2014 had
significantly increased in winter (Figure 6a)). Most of these
bacterial genera are facultatively anaerobic or strictly anaerobic,
which are often enriched in anthropogenic sources such as guts
of human and animals, composting, biogas, and wastewater
treatment plants according to the literature.50−54 Therefore, the
changes in winter might be explained by the increasing
contribution from anthropogenic sources to airborne PM2.5
that resulted from the increasing population density (from 717
person/km2 in the year 2004 to 807 person/km2 in the year 2014
according to Xi’an Statistical Yearbooks, 2005−2015)55 over the
past decade. Nonetheless, for summer, bacterial community
compositions in the year 2014 were clearly different from those
for both the year 2004 and 2009 as shown in Figure 6b).
Unexpectedly, Alpha diversity statistics (SI Excel file S3) implied
that for summer with more favorable bacterial growth conditions
such as temperature and humidity compared to other seasons
(see the meteorological parameters of different months in Xi’an
in the SI Table S2 and S3), there was a diversity loss detected in
airborne bacterial biota. The changes in airborne ARGs directly
reflected those occurring from the ground. Our results suggest
that different bacterial emissions from the ground were taking
place during the winner, for example, an increase in hospital
usages of antibiotics due to increasing population, thus resulting
in changes in airborne ARGs. The use of antibiotics can
eliminate or diminish certain bacteria by promoting abundances
of antibiotic-resistant genes and bacteria, and thus inhibiting the
growth of other competing bacteria.56−58 Previous studies have
also demonstrated the loss of bacterial community diversity in
various environmental media (e.g., human airways, effluents and
soils from animal husbandry facilities) that are frequently
subjected to a variety of antibiotics.56,59−61 As an emerging
biological pollutant, airborne ARGs when inhaled could likewise
induce the disequilibrium of respiratory tract bacterial
community and thus affect the immune system if up-taken and
further expressed by human-borne bacteria. Due to aerial
transport, remote regions even without using antibiotics could
be exposed to the “second hand” ARGs, which are initially being
developed in other regions but transported elsewhere. Results
here imply that urban air is being polluted by ARGs, and
different regions are challenged with varying but increasing
respiratory health risks related to PM-borne ARGs or ARB.
Among the detected cells in urban air, those airborne viable
bacteria carrying different ARGs can certainly cause more harm
than ARG itself and those ARG-carrying dead cells. However,
the long-term microecological consequences for both atmos-
phere and human respiratory system resulting from exposure of
airborne ARGs remain to be further explored. In future research
endeavors, more cities or regions on the global scale can be also
included for both spatial and temporal pattern analyses of
airborne ARGs. This work highlights the threat of airborne
transmission of ARGs and the need of redefining our current air
quality standards in terms with public health in an urban city.
