Abstract
Objective: Antipsychotics are licensed for psychosis and are also prescribed for behavior control. This study aims to examine
characteristics and outcomes of children prescribed antipsychotics.
Methods: A cohort study using general practice and hospital records linked with education records for 1,488,936 children
living in Wales between 1999 and 2015. The characteristics of the children who were prescribed antipsychotics are presented
using descriptive statistics and outcomes such as respiratory illness, diabetes, and injury were analyzed using multilevel
logistic regression and the prior event rate ratio (PERR).
Results: Children with intellectual difficulty/autism were more likely to be prescribed antipsychotics (2.8% have been
prescribed an antipsychotic [75% with autism] compared with 0.15% of children without intellectual difficulty). Those with
intellectual disabilities/autism were prescribed antipsychotics at a younger age and for a longer period. Antipsychotic use was
associated with a higher rate of respiratory illness for all (PERR of hospital admission: 1.55 [95% CI: 1.51–1.598] or increase
in rate of 2 per 100 per year in those treated), and for those with intellectual difficulty/autism, there was a higher rate of injury
and hospitalized depression. However, among those without intellectual difficulty/autism, there were lower rates of
depression (PERR: 0.55 [95% CI: 0.51–0.59]).
Conclusions: This work shows real-world use of antipsychotics and provides information on the rate of possible adverse events
in children treated. Antipsychotics are predominantly used for those with intellectual difficulty/autism rather than those with a
psychotic diagnosis. There is evidence that rates of respiratory disease, epilepsy, and diabetes are also higher postantipsychotic
use for all. In those with intellectual difficulty/autism, hospital-admitted depression and injury are higher postantipsychotic use.
The use of antipsychotics for behavioral management is likely to have increased cost implications to the healthcare system.

Introduction
A
ntipsychotic medication such as haloperidol, aripiprazole
(for schizophrenia, bipolar [mania]), or risperidone (for con-
duct disorders) are licensed in the United Kingdom for use in
children (Kavanagh et al. 2015). Off-label (not licensed for children
and adolescents) olanzapine, quetiapine, and amisulpride are also
used (Kavanagh et al. 2015) and the majority of antipsychotic
prescriptions is off label (Carton et al. 2015). Side effects of modern
(atypical) antipsychotics include weight gain, diabetes, high cho-
lesterol, and cardiovascular disease, and they are also associated
with an increase in seizure risk (Alper et al. 2007). Long-term use
can in rare cases be associated with tardive dyskinesia—a neuro-
logical disorder resulting in compulsive movement. Despite the

 side effects of antipsychotics, their use does appear to be on the rise
(Cooper et al. 2004; Olfson et al. 2006) and recent studies suggest
that they are prescribed more often for those with intellectual dif-
ficulty especially those with autism (Sheehan et al. 2015). Yet,
people with intellectual difficulty do not have significantly higher
rates of psychosis compared with the general population but are
likely to have more aggressive or disruptive behavior. Many of the
antipsychotics have sedative properties and some are licensed for
rapid tranquilization to manage acute violent behavior. However,
there are ‘‘deep concerns’’ about the overuse of antipsychotic
medicines in people with intellectual difficulty and autism (Health
2012) in terms of the extent to which these drugs are used outside
licensed indications with the aim of managing behavior problems.
In addition, the duration of treatment of the antipsychotic medi-
cations has been increasing (Kalverdijk et al. 2008; Rani et al.
2008; Tyrer and Kendall 2009).
There is some ‘‘limited evidence’’ that antipsychotics (e.g.,
risperidone) can reduce aggression and conduct problems in
children aged 5 to 18 with disruptive behavior in the short term
(4–10 weeks) from a small number of studies in which there was
some risk of bias of overestimating the true intervention effect
(Loy et al. 2012). NICE Conduct Disorder guidelines (NICE,
2013) recommend that clinicians should not offer pharmaco-
logical intervention for the routine management of behavioral
problems but suggest risperidone may be considered in some
cases for the short-term management of young people with ex-
plosive anger and severe emotion dysregulation. In terms of au-
tism, trials show improved behavioral problems, but also higher
levels of adverse events such as somnolence, upper respiratory
infection (Pandina et al. 2007), and higher weight gain (Scahill
et al. 2016; McCracken et al. 2002) Therefore, the evidence base
for behavioral management using antipsychotics is still at an
early stage and there are few studies examining the long-term
effects of this medication when started in childhood. For exam-
ple, the most recent long-term study has found that antipsychotic
use has increased for adolescents and young adults especially
among boys, but this study did not look at long-term outcomes
associated with these medications (Olfson et al. 2015).
Aims
This population-based observational study aimed to examine the
characteristics of children prescribed antipsychotics as found in
general practice (GP) records, before the age of 18, with a special
focus on those with intellectual difficulty and/or autism to examine
how antipsychotics are prescribed in a real-world setting and evi-
dence of long-term effects.
Methods
Study design and setting
A cohort study using routinely collected linked data, including
general practitioner, hospital admission, and education data. All
children in Wales between 1999 and 2015 were selected and
stratified by intellectual difficulty/autism and antipsychotic use.
Data sources
The Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research comprises four
nodes distributed across the United Kingdom. One of the nodes,
CIPHER (Centre for Improvement in Population Health through
E-records), brings together routine health data using the Secure
Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) data bank (Ford et al.
2009; Lyons et al. 2014), which anonymously links a wide range of
person-based data using a unique personal identifier. For the pur-
pose of this study, the GP records were linked with education data
(DECELLS) and hospital admission (inpatient) data. The GP sys-
tem uses READ codes, which are 5-digit codes that relate to diag-
nosis, medication, and process of care codes. This study examines
GP-prescribed prescriptions (but not hospital prescribing) for 70%
of all GP in Wales between 1999 and 2015. The secondary care
inpatient data set uses ICD10 codes for diagnosis and surgical in-
terventions, and the education data set contains information re-
garding special needs status (SNS), key stage achievements, and
attendance, and we used the information on SNS in this study. These
records were linked at the individual level for all children in Wales
and then stratified for subanalysis. Quality of linkage has been as-
sessed and reported as 99.9% for GP records and 99.3% for hospital
records (Lyons et al. 2009). All linkage was at the person level. The
requirement that a participant needed to have GP who was sub-
mitting records to the SAIL data bank meant that this study con-
tained 70% of all children living in Wales between 1999 and 2015.
Ethical approval
The data held by HIRU in the SAIL system are anonymized and
have been obtained with the permission of the relevant Caldicott
Guardian/Data Protection Officer; therefore, the National Research
Ethics Service has stated that no ethical review is required.
Approval was obtained from the SAIL Information Governance
Review Panel to use the SAIL system for this research question.
Participants and diagnosis of interest
Children with intellectual difficulty/autism were identified and
flagged as any child who had codes in the GP data for intellectual
difficulty health assessment, mental retardation, Down’s syn-
drome, learning disability, autism (excluding Asperger’s syn-
drome), or any child who had codes in the hospital admission
for chromosome disorders associated with intellectual disorder,
Down’s syndrome, mental retardation, or autism (excluding As-
perger’s syndrome), or any child in the education database who
was coded as profound and multiple learning disability, autistic
spectrum disorders, severe learning disability, or in the congen-
ital abnormalities data set of mental retardation, pervasive de-
velopmental disorders, or Down’s syndrome (See Supplementary
Table S1 for codes; Supplementary Data are available online at
www.liebertpub.com/cap).
The use of antipsychotic medication was identified to include
first- and second-generation agents (see Supplementary Table S1
for codes). However, we did not include antidepressants, non-
antipsychotic mood stabilizers, anxiolytics, and hypnotics (in-
cluding benzodiazepines), antidementia drugs, or drugs for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Variables.
Descriptive variables for mental health conditions
such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, and potential
outcomes such as diabetes, injury, and seizures were identified (see
Supplementary Table S1 for codes. Injury codes are available on
request) from GP and hospital admission data.
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using STATA 13 to present demographic
and descriptive data of groups stratified by intellectual difficulty/
autism and by antipsychotic use.
PROFILE OF CHILDREN ON ANTIPSYCHOTICS
181
 Logistic regression was used to examine the influence of known
confounders on the odds of having diabetes or epileptic seizure or
injury code during a 12-month period when prescribed an anti-
psychotic drug compared with 12-month periods when not on the
drug, clustered by individual, thus creating a multilevel or hierar-
chical model. For this analysis, all full GP records for a 12-month
period were recorded per individual with the explanatory variable
being a flag for ‘‘prescribed’’ antipsychotic 0 or 1 in that year and
the outcome variable being a flag for any diabetes event, epilepsy
event, or injury event in the GP/hospital in that year. The flag of 0
(no antipsychotic prescription) was given for years before an an-
tipsychotic prescription and for years when a person was no longer
prescribed antipsychotics. Confounders examined were intellectual
difficulty, gender, age, and aggression code. This method can adjust
for known confounders and can give an estimate of association or
the odds ratio for each confounder.
To adjust for unmeasured confounders (e.g., variables such as
family characteristics, diet, comorbidities, or personality traits), the
prior event rate ratio (PERR) was used. This method examines the
rate of diabetes/epilepsy/injury before prescription of the drug and
after prescription compared with a before and after a random date
period in children not prescribed antipsychotics. The PERR ad-
justment method estimates the effects of exposure to antipsy-
chotic medication on the likelihood of experiencing the adverse
medical outcomes of diabetes, epilepsy, or injury. The time to first
event over 3 years of follow-up was calculated from the date of
first antipsychotic (follow-up for 3 years) and for the 3 years
before the date of first antipsychotic. For those not given an an-
tipsychotic, a random date was chosen to calculate time to first
event before and after this random date. The PERR is calculated
as follows:
PERR ¼ Rate ratio during post period
Rate ratio during prior period
Confidence intervals were obtained by bootstrapping. The
method assumes that the confounding effects are constant across
the prior and postexposure periods and that there is no confounder
by treatment interactions (Uddin et al. 2015).
Results
A total of 1,488,936 children younger than 18 years were
identified from GP records (Table 1 and Supplementary Data S2)
and stratified by (1) no intellectual difficulty/autism, no childhood
history of antipsychotic use (n = 1,457,783, [97.9% of population],
51.4% male), (2) no intellectual difficulty/autism, antipsychotic use
(n = 2204 [0.15% of population], 60.4% male), (3) intellectual
difficulty, no childhood history of antipsychotic use (n = 28,125
[1.9% of population], 67% male), and (4) intellectual difficulty and
history of antipsychotic use (n = 824 [0.04% of population], 78.0%
male). Of those with an intellectual difficulty/autism, 2.84% (824/
28,949) had antipsychotics compared with 0.15% (2204/1,459,987)
who did not have an intellectual difficulty/autism (difference 2.7%
[95% CI: 2.5–2.9]). In this cohort, 3028 children were prescribed an
antipsychotic, 25% (n = 766) with intellectual difficulty/autism and
no psychotic disorder code, 1.9% (n = 58) with intellectual diffi-
culty/autism and psychotic disorder code, 11.8% (n = 357) with
psychotic disorder code (and not intellectual difficulty), and 61.3%
(n = 1847) with no intellectual difficulty/autism or psychotic dis-
order code (Table 1). The percentage treated with antipsychotics
per year is seen in Figure 1.
Comparison of groups
Those prescribed an antipsychotic were more likely to have an
intellectual difficulty/autism, be boys, have epilepsy, ADHD, and
more likely to be in a special needs school (Table 1). Those with
intellectual difficulty/autism were less likely to have a diagnosis of
a psychotic disorder but more likely to have an aggression code and
were prescribed antipsychotics at a younger age compared with
those prescribed an antipsychotic without an intellectual difficulty/
autism. Among those with intellectual difficulty/autism, the chil-
dren with aggression codes and especially those with autism (75%
of those on antipsychotics with an intellectual difficulty had a di-
agnosis of autism) were more likely to be prescribed an antipsy-
chotic. Children with Tourette’s (with or without an intellectual
difficulty) were more likely to be prescribed an antipsychotic.
However, among those with intellectual difficulties, children with
Down’s syndrome were less likely to be prescribed an antipsy-
chotic. Those prescribed an antipsychotic and who had intellectual
difficulty were less likely to be from a deprived area compared with
those prescribed an antipsychotic without an intellectual difficulty.
However, when all children with intellectual difficulty were con-
sidered, there was no significant difference in deprivation score
among those prescribed an antipsychotic or those not prescribed
antipsychotics.
Odds of epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, or injury
Epilepsy.
The main predictors of an epilepsy event in the
GP/hospital data were intellectual difficulty/autism and being
prescribed antipsychotics. Taking only those who were prescribed
antipsychotics and comparing the years when on an antipsychotic
with the years not on antipsychotic give a 1.4 higher rate of epilepsy
(when on drug) controlling for gender, intellectual difficulties/au-
tism, age, and aggression codes.
Diabetes.
The odds of a child going to the GP or hospital with
a diabetes event was 2.4 times higher if they were on an antipsy-
chotic, this is controlling for intellectual difficulty/autism, gender,
age, and aggression codes. For those children prescribed an anti-
psychotic, the odds of diabetes increased in the years they were on
the antipsychotic and as they got older, but there was no difference
of having an intellectual difficulty/autism or by gender.
Injury.
The odds of injury increased when taking an antipsy-
chotic drug. Taking only those on an antipsychotic showed lower
injury rates among those with intellectual difficulty/autism com-
pared with those without intellectual disabilities/autism (Table 2).
Injury rates were higher in boys (compared to girls) and increased
with age and the presence of aggression codes.
Respiratory infection.
The odds of respiratory infection in-
creased with antipsychotic prescription compared with those not
on an antipsychotic. However, respiratory infection was not found
to be higher in the years on the antipsychotic compared with years
not on the drug for those treated with this medication.
Depression.
The odds of depression were higher in those on
antipsychotics and higher in the years on an antipsychotic com-
pared with the years not on an antipsychotic. Depression increases
with age and is higher in those with aggression codes but lower in
boys and those with intellectual difficulty/autism.

 Prior event rate ratio.
Children on an antipsychotic were
more likely to attend their GP for epilepsy and/or diabetes events
compared with those not using an antipsychotic and compared to
the period before the antipsychotic prescription (Table 3). How-
ever, they were less likely to have an inpatient stay in hospital for
epilepsy or diabetes after their antipsychotic compared with before
their antipsychotic. The rate of respiratory conditions was higher for
those using an antipsychotic compared to controls in the after period
compared with the before drug period. This was found for both those
with intellectual difficulty/autism and those without. Those with in-
tellectual difficulty/autism were more likely to go to their GP and to
hospital with injury and more likely to go to hospital with depression
while using an antipsychotic (compared with the period before their
antipsychotic), but this was not seen for the general population of
children having an antipsychotic. In fact, in the general population,
the use of antipsychotics was associated with lower levels of
depression-related attendance at the GP and at hospital.
Discussion
This study shows the rates of adverse events in 3028 children
prescribed antipsychotics and can be used to inform the debate
regarding the use of these medications and the implications for the
patient and for services in the NHS. The study found that children
with intellectual difficulty/autism are more likely to be prescribed
an antipsychotic compared with children without intellectual dif-
ficulties, and those with autism are the most likely to have anti-
psychotics. After the prescription of antipsychotics, the number of
contacts at hospital and in the GP for respiratory disease increased
compared with expected numbers, as respiratory disease decreases
with age, so declines in those not prescribed an antipsychotic but
does not decline in those on an antipsychotic. Thus, looking at the
odds ratio of respiratory disease in those taking antipsychotics
(Table 2) does not show higher odds of respiratory infection after
antipsychotic compared with before, but looking at rates compared
to nonantipsychotic patients (Tables 2 and 3) does show relatively
higher rates of respiratory disease. The number of contacts for ep-
ilepsy and diabetes increases for the GP, but the number of inpatient
hospital visits for epilepsy or diabetes decreases. Children with
intellectual difficulty/autism are more likely to have injuries when
prescribed an antipsychotic and more likely to go into hospital with
depression compared with children without intellectual difficulty/
autism. However, those without an intellectual difficulty/autism had
lower rates of depression after the antipsychotic prescription.
This study does find evidence that supports evidence from trials
that antipsychotics are associated with high rates of respiratory
events (Pandina et al. 2007) and provides an assessment of the rate
of infection in this group compared with a control. The study gives
an estimated additional rate of epilepsy events and diabetes events
to inform healthcare planning and decision-making. The findings
suggest that children with intellectual difficulty/autism are pre-
scribed antipsychotics predominately for behavioral control/ag-
gression rather than psychotic disorder and predominately in those
with autism. Arguably, this is in an environment where some
studies show no significant benefit for managing behavioral prob-
lems (Ahmed et al. 2000; Tyrer et al. 2008; de Kuijper et al. 2014),
and evidence supporting behavioral control is limited but there are
significant positive effects on weight and bone density on discon-
tinuation (de Kuijper et al. 2013) of the drug. It could be argued that
there is limited evidence that antipsychotics can help manage this
behavior (Brylewski and Duggan 2004) and arguably that effects
on behavior may be due to the adverse event of somnolence as it

BROPHY ET AL.
 is unclear whether risperidone improves the core social and com-
munication impairment of autism (Posey et al. 2008). For example,
the increase in injury rates among those with intellectual difficulty/
autism may be due to somnolence and this hypothesis may be
supported by the finding of higher depression in this population
after antipsychotics. The reduction in injury in those without in-
tellectual difficulty/autism may be due to lowering self-harm be-
havior in this population and this may be supported by the lower
rate of depression in this population after antipsychotic use.
The findings of this study showed that 2.8% of children with
intellectual difficulty and/or autism were prescribed an antipsy-
chotic; these findings are similar to that seen in England (Glover
et al. 2015) where 2.4% of children and young people with an
intellectual difficulty/autism were given antipsychotic drugs. In this
report from England, the prescriptions rate then rose through adult
life. This study finds that seizures as measured in the GP data may
increase when using an antipsychotic and this finding could have
been predicted as antipsychotic lower seizure threshold (Barry and
Huynh 2001; Kavanagh et al. 2015). The finding that diabetes
events (in GP data) increase with antipsychotic use is also pre-
dictable due to known metabolic adverse effects of antipsychotics,
which have been shown to affect children more than adults (Correll
and Carlson 2006; Vitiello 2009). However, when using an anti-
psychotic, the number of hospital admissions for epilepsy or dia-
betes decreases. It is possible that the lowering of admissions may
be due to those on antipsychotics having more outpatient contacts
rather than emergency admissions. The outpatient records are not
routinely available by specialty and so were not examined in this
study. Therefore, we are not able to evaluate if total hospital con-
tacts change but could only say that hospital admissions decrease
after antipsychotic prescription and with general practitioners
taking on more diabetes care, especially that related to type 2 in-
sulin resistance; this may be a predictable finding. However, one
limitation of this study is we could only examine GP and hospital
admissions but could not capture other types of contact with the
health system such as outpatients, emergency department, or others
such as child and adolescent mental health services contacts. An-
tipsychotics can be prescribed in these other healthcare contacts
and in hospital admissions, but these prescriptions are missing from
this analysis (unless they are then taken over by the GP). Therefore,
the findings in this study will be an underestimate of the proportion
of children prescribed an antipsychotic and their healthcare con-
tacts. Certain aspects of this study were underpowered, for exam-
ple, we could not examine diabetes events in those with intellectual
difficulty/autism due to small numbers of events (e.g., less than 10
in the prior events of those using antipsychotics). Therefore, future
work could extend this analysis to a larger population such as that in
England and Scotland to confirm and validate findings as an in-
crease in diabetes not only leads to a long-term chronic condition in
those affected but also has implications for the NHS. In addition,

 this study examined 3 years of follow-up and this is likely to be too
short to really pick up a long-term diabetes risk. It did not examine
weight gain, insulin resistance, or metabolic syndrome but only
picked up end-stage diabetes and it is likely that true diabetes risk
may not be seen until adulthood; a 3-year period is too short. The
PERR does assume that the prior event does not distort prescribing
behavior and, in theory, a child with prior diabetes or epilepsy
would be less likely to be prescribed an antipsychotic. However,
looking at the prior rate in the PERR, there is no evidence that
prescriptions are less in those with existing comorbidities. In ad-
dition, this analysis did not take into account dose or break down
the antipsychotics by type and it is likely that the rate of adverse
events will be influenced by these factors. Finally, the definition of
intellectual difficulty is not straightforward using routine data and
some of the diagnostic codes used may be broad and there is po-
tential for confounding in that some individuals without intellectual
difficulty but with autism or with borderline problems are included.
Conclusions
Antipsychotics are prescribed predominantly to those with in-
tellectual difficulty/autism and there is evidence that they can in-
crease rates of respiratory disease, epilepsy, diabetes for all, and of
hospital-admitted depression and injury in the intellectual diffi-
culty/autism population. Children in special schools, those with
autism and those with aggression, are especially likely to be pre-
scribed an antipsychotic and this may be a marker that they have
more severe behavioral problems. Children with intellectual diffi-
culties are likely to be prescribed antipsychotic at a younger age
and for a longer period compared with those without intellectual
difficulties. There is evidence of higher rates of long-term adverse
events and this evidence can be used to inform healthcare provision
and costs associated with the use of antipsychotics.
Clinical Significance
This research finds antipsychotics are prescribed mainly for
children with learning difficulty and in this population there are
higher rates of adverse events, they are used at a younger age, and
for a longer time period. This work adds to the evidence base of the
use of antipsychotics in children.
