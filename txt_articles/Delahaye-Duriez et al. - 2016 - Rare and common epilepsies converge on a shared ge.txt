Abstract
Background: The relationship between monogenic and polygenic forms of epilepsy is poorly understood and the
extent to which the genetic and acquired epilepsies share common pathways is unclear. Here, we use an integrated
systems-level analysis of brain gene expression data to identify molecular networks disrupted in epilepsy.
Results: We identified a co-expression network of 320 genes (M30), which is significantly enriched for non-synonymous
de novo mutations ascertained from patients with monogenic epilepsy and for common variants associated with
polygenic epilepsy. The genes in the M30 network are expressed widely in the human brain under tight developmental
control and encode physically interacting proteins involved in synaptic processes. The most highly connected proteins
within the M30 network were preferentially disrupted by deleterious de novo mutations for monogenic epilepsy, in line
with the centrality-lethality hypothesis. Analysis of M30 expression revealed consistent downregulation in the epileptic
brain in heterogeneous forms of epilepsy including human temporal lobe epilepsy, a mouse model of acquired
temporal lobe epilepsy, and a mouse model of monogenic Dravet (SCN1A) disease. These results suggest functional
disruption of M30 via gene mutation or altered expression as a convergent mechanism regulating susceptibility to
epilepsy broadly. Using the large collection of drug-induced gene expression data from Connectivity Map, several
drugs were predicted to preferentially restore the downregulation of M30 in epilepsy toward health, most notably
valproic acid, whose effect on M30 expression was replicated in neurons.
Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest targeting the expression of M30 as a potential new therapeutic
strategy in epilepsy.

 Background
Epilepsy is a common, serious neurological disease princi-
pally characterised by a tendency to recurrent unprovoked
epileptic seizures [1–4]. Despite a large number of antiepi-
leptic drugs (AEDs) currently available to treat epilepsy,
approximately one-third of people with epilepsy have con-
tinuing uncontrolled seizures and there remains a global
imperative to develop new therapeutic approaches [5].
Traditional twin-based estimates of heritability [6–8]
and more recent genomic heritability analyses [9] have
established that epilepsy has a substantial genetic compo-
nent. Idiopathic epilepsy arising from an identified or pre-
sumed genetic etiology is termed ‘genetic epilepsy’ [10].
Analysis of genetic epilepsy segregating in a Mendelian
fashion using traditional linkage analysis led to the identi-
fication of several genes for epilepsy (reviewed in [11, 12]).
The majority of these Mendelian idiopathic epilepsy genes
encode ion channel subunits leading to the concept of the
genetic epilepsies as ‘ion channelopathies’. More recently,
the application of next-generation sequencing to the epi-
leptic encephalopathies (EE), a group of severe childhood-
onset epilepsies associated with refractory seizures and
intellectual disability (ID), have underscored the import-
ance of synaptic dysfunction in epilepsy and established
de novo mutagenesis as a major genetic mechanism for
EE [13, 14].
Common variant contributions to the more common
forms of adult and childhood epilepsy are less well de-
fined, although a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) in genetic generalised and
focal epilepsy identified genome-wide significant variants
in two genes involving synaptic function, SCN1A and
PCDH7 [15]. Analysis of genetic contributions to these
presumed polygenic forms of epilepsy using genotypes
recorded over single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
revealed that common variants collectively explain sub-
stantial phenotypic variation of epilepsy and suggested
that at least 400 variants (and potentially many thousands)
influence disease susceptibility [9]. For these common epi-
lepsies, there is an unresolved debate about whether
genetic susceptibility arises as a result of polygenic contri-
butions from common variants or whether these epilep-
sies comprise a large number of discrete diseases arising
from rare monogenic variation tagged by SNPs (reviewed
in [9, 16]).
As well as genetic contributions to epilepsy, in ap-
proximately 25% of cases the epilepsy has a clearly de-
fined acquired cause, such as following status epilepticus
(SE), head trauma or stroke [17]. While the precise
mechanisms underpinning the development of epilepsy
following brain injury (a process termed ‘epileptogenesis’)
are poorly understood, changes in expression of ion chan-
nels genes and synaptic receptors have been reported [18],
leading to the proposal that acquired epilepsy (AE) may
be a secondary ion channelopathy. These observations
suggest a possible convergence of mechanisms for genetic
and acquired epilepsy.
Systems biology and network analyses provide powerful
approaches to elucidate the molecular processes and
pathways underlying disease [19, 20]. Using genome-wide
transcriptional profiling in tissues relevant to the disease
under investigation, gene co-expression network analysis
can identify gene modules (i.e. sets of co-expressed genes)
as candidate regulators and drivers of disease [21, 22]. The
assumption is that the modular structure of co-expression
reflects the underlying activity of shared regulatory
mechanisms among sets of genes encoding functionally
related proteins [23]. Applications of co-expression net-
work methodology to epilepsy to date have identified a
pro-convulsant inflammatory gene network in the human
epileptic hippocampus [24] and revealed overlap between
genes that cause epileptic encephalopathy when mutated
and those that contribute to variation in healthy human
intelligence [25]. Beyond a better understanding of mo-
lecular drivers of disease, it is increasingly the case that
network analysis can also provide new candidate targets
for drug discovery or repurposing [26, 27].
Here, for the first time, we used a systems-level
approach based on gene co-expression network analysis
of the healthy human brain to identify physiological pro-
cesses and pathways perturbed in epilepsy. We aimed to
address a number of currently unanswered questions,
including whether there are brain-region specific contri-
butions to epilepsy, and the relationship between gene
networks for genetic epilepsy and molecular processes
disrupted in acquired epilepsy. The overall goal of our
study was to discover and prioritise gene networks that
could be targeted for future AED development.
To identify gene-regulatory networks for epilepsy we
chose post-mortem brain samples from healthy subjects
as our starting point because we wanted to identify nor-
mal brain processes perturbed in epilepsy and to avoid the
potential confounding effects of secondary or homeostatic
changes in gene expression related to the occurrence of
seizures themselves. A summary of our experimental de-
sign is shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, we used post-mortem hu-
man brain samples ascertained from individuals with no
history of psychiatric or neurological illness to build gene
co-expression networks (modules) that were expressed
across the whole brain or differential to one brain region
or another. In order to prioritise modules relevant to epi-
lepsy we: (1) integrated modules with a large database of
rare de novo mutations ascertained from patients with
monogenic EE (and neurodevelopmental disease more
generally); and (2) tested modules for enrichment of asso-
ciation to common forms of epilepsy using GWAS data.
Utilising this integrative approach, we report a single net-
work of 320 co-expressed genes genetically associated

 with monogenic and polygenic forms of epilepsy. Further
analysis revealed functional disruption and/or downregu-
lation of this network as a common mechanism regulating
susceptibility to genetic and acquired epilepsy broadly,
suggesting the network itself might be targeted as a novel
therapeutic approach. As proof of concept for this, we
show that among the many drugs capable of inducing
transcriptional changes in cells [28], valproic acid (VPA), a
widely used AED with a broad spectrum of clinical effi-
cacy, is the one that is most significantly predicted to re-
store the expression of the network in epilepsy toward
health.
Results
Gene co-expression network analysis in the brain
We hypothesised that unsupervised genome-wide co-
expression network analysis in the healthy human brain
may be informative for functional pathways disrupted in
epilepsy. As a first step, we aimed to identify gene co-
expression modules that were: (1) specific to an anatomical
brain region; or (2) co-expressed widely across the human
brain. The relationship of co-expression networks to epi-
lepsy was then investigated using an integrated approach,
exploring first the enrichment of co-expression networks
for monogenic and polygenic epilepsy genetic risk factors.
We then evaluated the relationship of networks genetically
associated to epilepsy to acquired forms of epilepsy.
As starting material, we used 88 post-mortem human
brains from the UK Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC)
[29], where genome-wide gene expression had been
assessed across nine brains regions: cerebellar cortex,
temporal cortex, frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippo-
campus, thalamus, white matter, medulla, and putamen.
Co-expression modules were inferred from these datasets
using two approaches: (1) consensus Weighted Gene Co-
expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify co-
expression modules common to all nine brain regions
(‘consensus modules’); and (2) DiffCoEx [30] to construct
modules of differentially co-expressed genes in one or
several brain regions compared to the other regions
(‘differential modules’). This identified 34 consensus
modules and 13 differential modules, respectively (see
Additional file 1: Table S1).
We then investigated whether these modules were re-
producible in separate gene expression datasets. To this
end, we used two unrelated publicly available brain ex-
pression datasets (see Additional file 2: Table S2) and
assessed module conservation using the Zsummary value
[31] (see ‘Methods’). First, we used micro-array gene ex-
pression data spanning fetal and post-natal human brain
development (‘Brainspan’
, GSE25219) [32, 33]; we ob-
served that 32 of 47 (68%) modules were at least moder-
ately preserved (Zsummary >5) in at least one brain region
during fetal development, and that these modules were
generally more significantly (Zsummary >10) preserved in
cortical samples from post-natal brain (see Additional
file 3: Figure S2).
We then analysed the preservation of co-expression
modules using messenger RNA (mRNA)-sequencing
(RNA-seq) expression data across different brain regions
as well as in non-brain tissues (latter to assess specifi-
city) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) pro-
ject [34, 35]. We observed that the brain co-expression
modules from UKBEC data were generally poorly pre-
served in non-cortical tissue (e.g. lymphocytes, fibroblasts)
(see Additional file 3: Figure S2), but well preserved using
GTEx data relating to cortical brain regions; 20 out of 34
(59%) consensus modules and 8 out of the 13 (61%) dif-
ferential modules were highly significantly preserved
(Zsummary >10) in at least one brain region from both the
Brainspan and GTEx datasets. Finally, we assessed module
preservation across-species using RNA-seq data from 100
healthy adult mouse hippocampus samples [24]; 20 out of
34 (59%) human consensus modules and 8 out the 14
(57%) differential modules were at least moderately pre-
served in the healthy mouse hippocampus (Zsummary >5).
In summary, taking into account the overlap of modules
preserved according to these comparative network analyses,
(See figure on previous page.)
Fig. 1 Schematic overview of study design. We hypothesised that gene regulatory networks in the human healthy brain disrupted by de novo
mutations ascertained from patients with epileptic encephalopathy could be informative for molecular processes involved in different types of
epilepsy. We used post-mortem human brain samples ascertained from individuals with no history of psychiatric or neurological illness from the
UK Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC) dataset to build gene co-expression networks (modules) that are expressed across the whole brain
(‘consensus’ modules, using the WCGNA consensus method), or differential to one brain region or another (‘differential’ modules, using DiffCoEx
method). In order to prioritise modules relevant to epilepsy, we integrated modules with whole-exome-sequencing (WES) studies data of rare de
novo mutations ascertained from patients with epileptic encephalopathy (EE) and neurodevelopmental disease more generally (ASD autism spectrum
disorder, SCZ schizophrenia, ID intellectual disabilities, DDD broad developmental disease from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study).
A single module was selected in this way: M30. Our hypothesis was that disruption of this gene network might lead to different types of epilepsy.
M30 was therefore tested for enrichment of association to common forms of epilepsy using GWAS data from the International League against Epilepsy
(ILAE) meta-analysis. Analysis of network genes’ expression in disease in three epilepsies suggested functional disruption and/or downregulation of the
network as a common mechanism regulating susceptibility to epilepsy broadly and therefore that the network itself might be targeted as a novel
therapeutic strategy. As a proof of concept, we show that among the drugs capable of inducing transcriptional changes in cells of the Connectivity
map (Cmap) dataset, VPA, a widely used AED with a broad spectrum of clinical efficacy, is the one that is most significantly predicted to restore the
expression of M30 in epilepsy toward health. Full details relating to datasets, experimental methods and references are provided in the manuscript

 we identified 18 consensus and eighy differential modules
that are reproducible in unrelated brain expression datasets
including between species and across pre- and post-natal
human life. We hypothesised that these preserved gene
networks inferred from healthy human brain samples rep-
resent a transcriptional architecture underpinning critical
brain functions and so investigated their relationship to
epilepsy.
Integration with rare de novo epilepsy variants
De novo single nucleotide variants (de novo mutations,
DNMs) were collated from published whole-exome se-
quencing (WES) studies of probands with monogenic EE
and their unaffected parents (n = 356 trios) [13, 14]. In
view of the established genetic overlap between neurode-
velopmental disorders [25, 36, 37], we extended the ana-
lysis to include WES trio datasets for autism spectrum
disorder (ASD, n = 4186), schizophrenia (SCZ, n = 1004),
ID (n = 192), and broad developmental disease from
the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study (DDD,
n = 1,133) (see ‘Methods’ for cohort references). For
each co-expression module, we tested for the enrich-
ment of DNMs, focusing on non-synonymous DNMs
(consisting of all missense, nonsenses, and splice-site
mutations) and including tests of enrichment for syno-
nymous DNMs as a negative control. We also calculated
enrichment of DNMs among the set of ‘Background’
genes (i.e. all genes significantly expressed in the UKBEC
brain regions used to infer the co-expression modules).
Integrating co-expression modules with DNM data
across these five phenotypic categories (EE, ASD, SCZ,
ID, DDD), we identified only a single module (consensus
module M30), which was highly and specifically enriched
for non-synonymous DNMs for EE (Fisher’s exact test
(FET) P = 2.11 × 10–10, odds ratio (OR) = 5.38, 95% con-
fidence
interval
(CI) = 3.13–9.32).
This
enrichment
remained significant after adjustment for the number of
modules and phenotypes tested (Bonferroni corrected P
value threshold = 6.44 × 10–8). No other module was
significantly enriched for non-synonymous DNM for any
neurodevelopmental phenotype above the Background
(see Fig. 2, Additional file 4: Table S3). There was no
enrichment for any module in disease-ascertained syno-
nymous DNMs.
Functionally, module M30 is highly enriched for
genes relevant to various neural processes, including
‘transmission of nerve impulse’ (Benjamini–Hochberg
(BH) corrected P = 3.25 × 10–17, ratio of enrichment
(r) = 4.0), ‘synaptic transmission’ (BH P = 7.75 × 10–15,
r = 4.0), ‘gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signalling
pathway’ (BH P = 6.64 × 10–6, r = 7.56) and ‘synaptic
vesicle transport’ (BH P = 6.46 × 10–7, r = 18.37) (see
Additional file 1: Table S1).
Since previous studies have shown that gene modules
detected in the brain often correspond to (or reflect)
expression in one or more cell types [38–40], we took
advantage of recently published single-cell RNA-seq
data [41] to annotate M30 for cell type expression (see
‘Methods’). Module M30 was significantly enriched in
marker genes for interneurons (FET P value = 1.65 × 10–8,
OR = 4.37) and pyramidal neurons (FET P value = 7.71 ×
10–4, OR = 3.07). This mixed cell-type enrichment is con-
sistent with the expression profile of M30 genes in the
Allen Brain Institute single-cell RNA-seq brain dataset
[42] (Fig. 3a). We then explored the expression of M30
genes in different stages of human brain development
utilising data from Kang et al. [32] (see ‘Methods’) and
observed a clear developmental gradient of expression of
M30 genes beginning in early mid-fetal development (i.e.
post-conception weeks 16–19), maximal by birth and then
persisting through all post-natal periods (Fig. 3b). This
clear developmental trajectory of expression of M30 led
us to explore its transcriptional regulation. Using the
WebGestalt toolkit [43] to test for enrichment of tran-
scription factor binding sites (TFBS), we found M30 was
highly enriched for NRSF/REST (repressor element 1-
silencing transcription factor) targets (BH P = 2.55 × 10–8,
r = 8.50). REST is a repressor of neuron-specific genes in
early fetal development whose activity is downregulated in
mature neurons [44] and dysregulated in a large array of
brain pathologies including epilepsy [45–48]. The strong
enrichment for REST-target genes in M30 is consistent
with the tightly regulated developmental trajectory of
expression of this module during brain development and
supports the hypothesis that M30 genes non-randomly
share a common regulation.
We then investigated the physical interactions between
the protein products of M30 genes. First, selecting
sources of protein-protein interaction (PPI) from the
STRING database [49], we found highly significant en-
richment for PPI among M30 genes (expected number
of PPI = 120, observed number of PPI = 217, enrichment
P = 1.11 × 10–15) (see ‘Methods’). Then, we tested M30
for enrichment in PPI using the DAPPLE module [50, 51]
of the GenePattern platform [52] and confirmed signifi-
cant enrichment (expected Direct Edges Count (DEC):
59.33, observed DEC: 180, empirical P = 0.001). In
addition, we collated non-redundant physical PPI data
from three different sources: GeneMANIA [53], Hippie
[54] and iRefWeb [55] (see ‘Methods’). Using experi-
mentally derived physical interactions that could be
mapped to gene names using HUGO Gene Nomenclature
Committee database [56], our final database contained in-
formation for 272,348 non-redundant protein interactions
for 17,235 genes, 13,489 of which are expressed in the
UKBEC dataset. We then tested M30 genes for enrich-
ment in proteins involved in intra-modular PPI compared
Delahaye-Duriez et al. Genome Biology  (2016) 17:245 
Page 5 of 18
 to 100,000 simulated random control modules of similar
size (see ‘Methods’). The M30 PPI network (Fig. 4) had
significantly more nodes than the simulated PPI networks
(142 nodes in the M30 PPI network out of 320 genes,
empirical P = 0.02). This significant enrichment of the co-
expression module M30 for direct PPI provides an inde-
pendent line of evidence to support the validity of this
module.
We then investigated the relationship between the top-
ology of the M30 PPI network and epilepsy and to this
aim we determined the degree of each node, i.e. the
number of direct PPI/edges/connections that a node has
with other nodes within the network. We found that genes
disrupted by non-synonymous DNMs in monogenic EE
patients are enriched in genes encoding proteins with a
higher degree within the network (Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) ranking genes according to the degree,
Normalised Enrichment Score (NES) = 2.4, false discovery
rate (FDR) = 0.1%). We also detected a relative enrichment
of non-synonymous DNMs among genes coding for
proteins with a degree superior to two (FET P value =
4.2 × 10–4, OR = 6.77) (see Additional file 3: Figure S3).

DNM in cases compared to controls for all modules. For each co-expression module obtained from consensus WGCNA (circle, n = 34) and DiffCoEx
(plus symbol, n = 13), the enrichment was tested adopting FET (see ‘Methods’). Each dot represents a module and its significance of enrichment in
non-synonymous DNMs (consisting of all missense, nonsenses, and splice-site mutations) is reported on the y-axis. The over-representation of DNM in cases
compared to controls was calculated for several phenotypes: ASD (4186 trios, dark blue dots), SCZ (1004 trios, light blue dots), congenital abnormalities of
the DDD study (1133 trios, grey dots), across four neurodevelopmental disorders consisting of EE, ID, ASD and SCZ (combined, 5738 trios, green dots), ID
(192 trios, orange dots) and EE (356 trios, red dots). b Enrichment of non-synonymous DNM from patients with neurodevelopmental disease in M30 module.

 This suggests that the genes in M30 impacted by non-
synonymous DNMs in EE tend to be more highly con-
nected within the PPI network (Fig. 4).
Integration with common epilepsy variants
The genetic association of M30 with rare monogenic
forms of epilepsy led us to explore the relationship

 between M30 and common forms of focal epilepsy (FE)
and genetic generalised epilepsy (GGE), using GWAS
data from the International League Against Epilepsy
(ILAE) Consortium [15]. This meta-analysis of GWAS
studies in common epilepsies consisted of 5310 FE cases
and 23,606 controls and 2606 GGE cases and 18,990
controls. The enrichment of association of M30 to each
phenotype was tested as previously described (see
‘Methods’) [25]. As a negative control, and to assess the
specificity of the epilepsy GWAS enrichments, each
module was also tested against five large GWAS of clin-
ical phenotypes with no known relationship to epilepsy
(waist/hip ratio, fasting insulin homeostasis, glucose
challenge homeostasis, systolic blood pressure and dia-
stolic blood pressure). We observed significant enrich-
ment of association between M30 and focal epilepsy
(FE: enrichment P = 0.00019, FDR < 5%, Z-score = 3.55)
and between M30 and genetic generalised epilepsy
(GGE: enrichment P = 0.0044, FDR < 5%, Z-score = 2.62)
(see Table 1, Additional file 5: Table S4). None of the nega-
tive control GWAS datasets showed significant enrich-
ment of association (see Additional file 5: Table S4). A
constituent gene within M30 is SCN1A, which is a known
genome-wide significant susceptibility gene for epilepsy
[15, 54, 55]. We therefore re-tested the enrichment of
association between M30 and epilepsy after excluding
SCN1A from the list of M30 genes. After removing
SCN1A from the set of M30 genes, the enrichment of as-
sociation between M30 and epilepsy remained significant
for both focal (FE: enrichment P = 0.0019, Z-score = 2.88)
and generalised (GGE: enrichment P = 0.0097, Z-score =
2.34) epilepsy. In parallel, M30’s enrichment for non-
synonymous rare variant DNM ascertained from patients

In summary, these integrative analyses suggest M30 as
a convergent gene co-expression (and PPI) network in-
volved in the genetic susceptibility to both rare monogenic
and common polygenic forms of epilepsy. We therefore
further explored M30 genes and investigated their rela-
tionship to epilepsy more broadly.
Relationship of M30 expression to broad forms
of epilepsy
We used genome-wide gene expression data from disease
hippocampus tissues to investigate the association be-
tween expression of M30 genes and epilepsy. Differential
expression analysis was carried out using gene expression
data from: (1) the human epileptic hippocampus (24 TLE
patients/23 controls) assayed by microarray; (2) the mouse
epileptic hippocampus from the pilocarpine post-SE
model of chronic TLE (100 cases/100 controls); and (3)
the mouse hippocampus from a model of Dravet (SCN1A)
disease (4 cases/ 4 controls) assayed by RNA-seq (see
‘Methods’). GSEA [57] was applied genome-wide to the
ranked list of gene scores (reflecting both the significance
and the magnitude of expression changes in epilepsy,
see ‘Methods’) to test for enrichment of differentially
expressed genes in the set of M30 network genes. The
GSEA was carried out accounting for the direction of
effect, i.e. considering whether a gene is upregulated or
downregulated in each type of epilepsy.
M30 genes were significantly enriched for genes down-
regulated in the epileptic hippocampus in all three epilep-
sies (human TLE: NES = −4.51, P < 10–5; acquired post-SE
TLE: NES = −5.83, P < 10–5; Dravet model: NES = −3.69,
P < 10–5) (see Additional file 3: Figure S4). In contrast,
the whole set of genes impacted by non-synonymous
DNMs ascertained from EE patients was not signifi-
cantly enriched for downregulated or upregulated genes
(see Additional file 6: Table S5).
The observation that M30 is enriched for genes which
are downregulated in multiple types of epilepsy led us to
investigate the relationship between the level of expression
of M30 genes and seizure frequency using the post-SE
mouse model of TLE. Here, we used seizure frequency data
obtained from 14 days of continuous video monitoring of
epileptic mice beginning 28 days following pilocarpine in-
duced SE [24, 58]. Using 1:1 orthologues, correlation of
M30 gene expression levels with seizure frequency was
undertaken using GSEA (see ‘Methods’). This analysis re-
vealed a significant enrichment in M30 for genes whose ex-
pression in the epileptic hippocampus was anti-correlated
to the frequency of seizures (NES = –6.68, P < 10–4) (i.e. in-
creased expression of M30 genes correlates with fewer
epileptic seizures, see Additional file 3: Figure S5).
Taken together, these analyses suggest functional disrup-
tion by rare or common variation and/or downregulation
of M30 gene expression as a convergent mechanism influ-
encing susceptibility to epilepsy and seizures broadly.
While the precise mechanistic connection between gene-
tic disruption of M30 genes at the DNA sequence level
and dysregulation of expression of M30 genes remains to
be determined, the convergence of these orthogonal func-
tional perturbations on M30 suggest targeting this net-
work might represent a novel therapeutic opportunity.
Valproic acid reverses the downregulation of M30
We hypothesised that M30 represents a potential candi-
date network to target as a therapeutic strategy. We
therefore aimed to identify small molecules whose effect
on gene expression could restore the downregulation of
M30 genes observed in epilepsy toward health. One ap-
proach to identifying drugs with this property is to com-
putationally ‘screen’ drugs according to the extent and
specificity of the overlap between genes differentially
expressed by a drug and the component genes in the
disease network. To date, the largest database reporting
empirical changes in cellular gene expression following
drug exposure is Connectivity Map (CMap), which re-
ports transcriptional signatures for 1300 compounds
[28]. In order to screen drugs in CMap in terms of their
predicted ability to restore M30 expression in epilepsy
toward health, we first carried out differential expression
analysis to identify genes with significant (FDR < 10%)
drug-induced differential expression (DE) (see ‘Methods’).
For the 152 drugs with ≥10 significantly differentially
expressed genes in CMap, we tested the overlap of M30
genes with drug-induced DE, taking into account whether
a gene was upregulated or downregulated by a given drug.
Among the drugs whose induced transcriptional changes
overlapped significantly with M30 in a therapeutic direc-
tion (see Additional file 7: Table S6), the strongest overlap
was with genes differentially expressed by VPA (for MCF7
cell line with the concentration of 0.0005 mol/L, FET
P = 9.93 × 10–5, BH P = 0.0089, OR = 4.81). Moreover,
we observed a dose-dependent effect of VPA on M30 ex-
pression in a direction suggesting higher doses of VPA
would have a greater therapeutic effect (see Additional
file 3: Figure S6). VPA is an established and widely used
AED with an established dose-dependent therapeutic
response and a broad spectrum of clinical efficacy
against different types of epilepsy (reviewed in [59]).
To seek replication for the predicted therapeutic effect
of VPA on M30 gene expression, and to assess the rele-
vance of gene expression changes observed in the cancer
cell lines used by CMap to neurons, we analysed gene
expression changes in 16 day neurons differentiated
from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) before and
after treatment with VPA (here studying VPA as its
Delahaye-Duriez et al. Genome Biology  (2016) 17:245

 sodium salt which is therapeutically equivalent to VPA)
(see ‘Methods’). Using expression profiles from neurons
treated with VPA and untreated control neurons repre-
senting the 5540 mouse genes with one-to-one human
orthologues, and considering genes differentially expressed
by VPA at FDR < 10%, we observed that VPA upregu-
lates 51% of mapped M30 genes (significance of overlap
compared to random expectation P = 4.9 × 10–12, OR =
4.53) and downregulates only 9% of mapped M30 genes
(P = 0.013, OR = 0.42). These data confirm significant
overall upregulation of M30 by VPA (see Additional file 3:
Figure S7), replicating and strengthening the results ob-
tained from the analysis of VPA-induced DE in the cancer
cell lines from CMAP. While these in vitro results will ul-
timately require validation in vivo, they provide replicable
evidence for the potential to use drug-induced upregula-
tion of the epilepsy-related M30 network as a potential
novel therapeutic strategy.
Discussion
The systematic integration of diverse genomic datasets,
including brain gene expression data, de novo mutations
for rare monogenic epilepsies and GWAS data from
common epilepsy reported here, identified a conver-
gence of genetic susceptibility for epilepsy on a gene-
regulatory network (M30). The M30 network consists of
320 genes co-expressed across the human brain under
tight developmental control. We observed that rare de
novo mutations for monogenic epilepsy preferentially
impact the mostly highly connected genes in the network.
These results provide evidence for a shared pathogenesis
between the rare and polygenic forms of epilepsy, al-
though whether the enrichment of association of M30
with polygenic epilepsy reflects tagged rare variant contri-
butions to the disease or true enrichment of common
variants remains to be determined.
The
absence
of
significant
enrichment
in
non-
synonymous DNMs ascertained from patients with ID,
ASD or SCZ for any brain co-expression network was
unexpected given the emerging evidence for overlap in
genetic susceptibility between the different brain develop-
mental disorders [60] and the previously demonstrated
higher connectivity among genes mutated in SCZ [61]
and ASD [62]. One potential biological explanation is that
the pathways disrupted in these diseases (in contrast to
EE) are specific to a particular stage of neurodevelopment
and so unrepresented in the co-expression networks we
built from adult human brain samples [61, 62]. Alterna-
tively, the heterogeneity of pathways disrupted in EE may
be less than for some other neuro-developmental diseases
or potentially, the disrupted pathways are specific to a par-
ticular cell type which is not captured by co-expression
analysis in bulk brain tissue. Future analyses using cell-
type specific RNA-seq at different stages of development
will more fully resolve the co-expression relationships
between genes for the different neurodevelopmental
diseases.
Functionally, the M30 module is highly enriched for
genes involved in neural processes and synaptic func-
tion. The network is highly expressed in interneurons
and pyramidal neurons, is enriched for genes that are
downregulated in the epileptic hippocampus in hetero-
geneous forms of epilepsy including human TLE, a
mouse model of acquired TLE and a mouse model of
monogenic Dravet (SCN1A) disease, and M30’s expres-
sion is significantly negatively correlated with seizures.
These results suggest that M30 may play a role in main-
taining the homeostatic balance between excitation and
inhibition in the mammalian brain which, when dis-
rupted by either genetic variation or altered expression,
contributes to epilepsy susceptibility and seizures. These
findings suggested targeting the expression of M30 as a
potential new therapeutic strategy.
At the level of protein-protein interactions, several
studies based on whole-exome sequencing trio analysis
of neurodevelopmental disease have reported that genes
with de novo loss-of-function mutations code for highly
interconnected protein networks for autism [63], schizo-
phrenia [61] and EE [14]. In keeping with this, we found
that the protein products of M30 genes are also signifi-
cantly enriched for direct protein-protein interactions.
In protein networks, the nodes with high degree (i.e.
highly connected proteins), also termed hubs, are often
functionally important. The most striking examples of this
were initially discovered in worm, fly, yeast and E. coli
proteomes, leading to the ‘centrality-lethality’ hypothesis
which proposes that nodes with higher centrality in a net-
work are more likely to produce disease phenotypes when
removed compared to nodes with lower centrality
[64–66]. In humans, the location of genes that cause
disease within a network is more debated. Defining hu-
man essential genes as orthologues of mouse genes that
result in embryonic or postnatal lethality when disrupted
by homologous recombination, it was argued that it is the
essential genes, and not the disease genes, that encode
hubs [21, 67]. However, the centrality hypothesis of
disease genes has been put forward several times, particu-
larly in cancer [68], but also more generally for genes with
phenotype-causing mutation in OMIM [69]. A more re-
cent study on the structural controllability of human di-
rected protein networks defined indispensable proteins
and demonstrated that these proteins are enriched in
disease-causing mutations [70]. Whether the centrality of
genes disrupted by non-synonymous DNM in highly
penetrant (often monogenic and severe) forms of epilepsy
will hold true also for genes harbouring common risk vari-
ants identified from large-scale epilepsy GWAS remains
to be determined.

 The analysis of differential expression of M30 genes in
epileptic brain tissue versus controls showed a consistent
enrichment in the M30 module for downregulated genes
in epilepsy. Using quantitative data of seizure frequency
in epileptic mice, we observed a significant enrichment
in M30 for genes whose expression in the epileptic
hippocampus was anti-correlated to the frequency of
seizures (higher M30 expression correlated with fewer
seizures). These analyses, together with genetic associ-
ation of M30 to both monogenic and polygenic forms of
epilepsy, suggest M30 may play a role in the mechanistic
pathways leading to epilepsy. This led us to hypothesise
that targeted increases in M30 expression could be
exploited as a novel therapeutic approach in epilepsy.
Using the CMap dataset, we prioritised several drugs
and in particular VPA, a widely used AED, as having a
preferential and therapeutic effect on M30 expression.
No other established AED had a significant effect on
M30 gene expression in the CMap database and the
identification of VPA as a candidate therapy for epilepsy
was entirely independent of its known role in epilepsy or
mechanism of action [59, 71] and based solely on an un-
supervised analysis of disease and drug-related differen-
tial gene expression. Although VPA has a rapid onset of
anticonvulsant activity, suggesting a direct effect on
neuronal electrophysiology, the anticonvulsant activity of
VPA has also been noted to increase during prolonged
treatment [72], suggesting a potential transcriptional
mechanism mediating its antiepileptic activity. These
unsupervised analyses therefore suggest a systematic
screen of drug-like molecules based on their measured
effect on M30 gene expression might represent an effi-
cient therapeutic strategy for new drug discovery in epi-
lepsy. In keeping with this, of the 15 drugs in CMap
predicted to result in an overall significant upregulation
of M30 (see Additional file 7: Table S6), whitaferin A
(WFA) is a steroidal lactone present in Withania somnifera
(also known as Indian ginseng or Ashwagandha), a plant
that has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries in
the treatment of a wide range of diseases including epilepsy
[73] and studies in animal models have also reported the
anticonvulsive effect of this drug [74, 75].
Since M30 is highly expressed in interneurons and
pyramidal neurons our analyses do not currently distin-
guish between specific downregulation of M30 in neurons
or secondary neuronal loss in epilepsy. Loss of neurons
and interneurons can be a feature of human TLE [76], as
well as some animal models of acquired epilepsy [77].
However, in Dravet disease, despite evidence for inter-
neuron dysfunction [78], neuropathological analyses have
shown a striking preservation of interneurons and neu-
rons despite decades of poorly controlled epilepsy [79].
Consistent with this, our analysis of changes in expression
of cell type marker genes (see Additional file 6: Table S5)
found no evidence for interneuron loss in the Dravet,
mouse model, although did suggest pyramidal neurons
may be lost in Dravet. Future analyses focusing on single
cell-type sequencing in the epileptic brain will be required
to distinguish between downregulation of M30 specifically
or differential neuron/interneuron loss. However, regard-
less of the mechanism of reduced M30 expression in epi-
lepsy (i.e. specific downregulation in epileptic neurons/
interneurons or differential cell loss), the suggestion of
targeting upregulation of M30 network as a means of
compensating for the resulting functional deficit is un-
altered as a potential therapeutic rationale.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our results implicate a convergent role for
a synaptic gene network (M30) in rare monogenic and
common (presumed polygenic) forms of epilepsy and
suggest targeting the expression of this network is poten-
tial new therapeutic strategy in epilepsy. Further studies
will be required to clarify the specific contribution of M30
genes to ictogenesis and to identify gene-regulatory factors
or drugs that influence M30 expression in a therapeutic
direction.
Methods
Weighted gene co-expression network analysis of nine
brain regions post-mortem human samples
Brain region expression datasets
The UK Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC) released
genome-wide gene expression data from several brain
regions of individuals of European descent (GSE60862)
[80]. We selected samples for which data were available
for the same 88 neuropathologically normal individuals
in all the nine following brain regions: cerebellar cortex,
frontal cortex, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, hippo-
campus, putamen, thalamus, medulla and white matter.
Raw expression profiles from the Affymetrix Human
Exon 1.0 ST Array were processed to transcript-level
expression
with
Affymetrix
Power
Tools
(APT)
(http://www.affymetrix.com/partners_programs/programs/
developer/tools/powertools.affx) using probe logarith-
mic intensity error (PLIER) normalisation [81] with
probe GC-content correction. Only the most reliable
‘core’ set of probes was used to generate transcript level
expression profiles as defined in the Affymetrix chip
definition file. Probes were retained if more than 50%
of the samples in at least one brain region that had detec-
tion background P values < 0.01. Gene-level expression
was obtained by taking the median of the expression
values of multiple exons mapping to the same gene. These
filtering steps defined a final dataset of 20,388 probes,
representing 15,199 protein coding unique genes (hg19/
GRCh37/Ensembl version 75), which were then used after
Delahaye-Duriez et al. Genome Biology  (2016) 17:245

 quantile normalisation for network analysis and as the
‘background’ gene set for enrichment analyses.
Before inferring gene co-expression networks, we used
the probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER)
package [82] to determine hidden factors that explain
much of the expression variability in the dataset. We used
principal component analysis (PCA) to calculate summary
variables describing the variation in the microarray ex-
pression of the 15,199 genes and estimate the potential
effects of the hidden factors identified by PEER and of the
known clinical covariates on global gene expression vari-
ability. The plotting of hidden factors across samples
allowed us to select the hidden factors F1 and F4 as poten-
tial batch effect without high relation to the variability ex-
plained by brain regions (see Additional file 3: Figure S1).
Gene expression levels were therefore adjusted to remove
the effect of the selected hidden factors and covariates
(F1, F4, age, gender, post-mortem interval, cause of death
and brain-bank ID) by fitting linear models on gene ex-
pression using the lm function in R. The residuals from
the linear model were then used as expression values (for
15,199 genes in 88 samples of each brain region dataset).
Co-expression network construction
Genes were then grouped into modules using co-
expression network approaches on the nine brain regions
datasets: consensus method implemented in WGCNA to
pinpoint co-expression modules common to the nine
brain regions and DiffCoEx [30] to construct modules of
differentially co-expressed genes in one or several regions
compared to the others.
The consensus co-expression network analysis was car-
ried out using the blockwiseConsensusModules function in
the WGCNA R package as previously described [83, 84],
with the following parameters: β = 7 (chosen based on the
scale free topology criterion r2 > 0.8), minModuleSize =
40, mergeCutHeight = 0.25, minBlockSize = 20,000, cor-
Type = ‘bicor’ (to compute robust pairwise correlations
of gene expression using Tukey’s biweight method
[85]). Briefly, for each brain region a pairwise correl-
ation matrix was calculated and then converted to an
adjacency matrix by raising it to the β power. For each
pair of genes, topological overlap matrix (TOM) was
calculated based on the adjacency matrix. After the
TOM of each brain region was scaled to make them
comparable, the consensus TOM was calculated by taking
the component-wise minimum of the TOMs of each indi-
vidual brain region. The consensus TOM was then clus-
tered using average hierarchical clustering based on the
dissimilarity of gene connectivity, defined as 1 – consen-
sus TOM. Consensus co-expression modules were defined
as branches of the resulting clustering tree, using dynamic
tree-cutting [86].
The differential co-expression network analysis was
carried out using the DiffCoEx method with its variant
for multiple conditions [30]. DiffCoEx analyses were car-
ried out in R following the procedure described [30].
Briefly, DiffCoEx builds on WGCNA framework by
computing a TOM generated from a matrix of adjacency
differences between conditions, therefore it focuses on
detecting the differences in co-expression patterns be-
tween these conditions. Tukey’s biweight method [85] was
used to compute robust pairwise correlations of gene ex-
pression and applied β = 7 as soft thresholding value.
Testing preservation and reproducibility of the UKBEC
consensus and differential modules in other datasets
Several independent brain gene-expression datasets were
used to establish that the modules derived from the
UKBEC samples were reproducible in the healthy human
brain during development and at different ages across life,
in different brain regions and tissues, and in the hippo-
campus of mice (see Additional file 2: Table S2).
To test spatio-temporal preservation of modules, we
used transcriptome data from GSE25219 [32, 33]. These
microarray expression data were generated using Affyme-
trix Human Exon 1.0 ST array analysis of 16 brain regions
from 1263 samples collected from 53 clinically unremark-
able post-mortem human brains, spanning embryonic de-
velopment to late adulthood. The quantile normalisation
and filtering using expectation maximisation (EM) algo-
rithm was done as previously described [25]. The RNA-
seq expression data from the GTEx project was used to
analyse the preservation of co-expression modules across
different brain regions but also in other tissues. The fully
processed, normalised and filtered gene level expression
data were downloaded from http://www.gtexportal.org/
(GTEx_Analysis_V6). The raw data of the E-MTAB-3123
dataset of epileptic and normal human hippocampi were
downloaded from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/ex-
periments/E-MTAB-3123/. Data normalisation, adjust-
ment and filtering were applied as previously described
[87]. We also used the human post-mortem hippocampus
microarray expression data from 63 healthy post-
mortem human brains publicly available from Pritzker
Neuropsychiatric Disorders Research Consortium (http://
www.pritzkerneuropsych.org/?page_id=1196, GSE45642).
These data were processed as previously described [25].
Finally, to assess whether the modules were preserved in
another species we used the RNA-seq data from mouse
hippocampi previously generated and processed [24]. The
datasets were annotated with human Ensembl gene ID
using the biomaRt Bioconductor R package [88, 89] and
selecting human genes that were ‘one-to-one’ orthologues
with mouse genes.
We used the function modulePreservation of WGCNA
R package to calculate the Zsummary value for each
Delahaye-Duriez et al. Genome Biology  (2016) 17:245 
Page 12 of 18
 module [31]. This function computes a permutation test
to estimate the mean and variance of several preserva-
tion statistics under the null hypothesis of no relation-
ship between the module assignments in the reference
and test data. The Zsummary value summarises density
and connectivity based Z statistics generated through
these permutations and therefore is indicative of the
module robustness and reproducibility. In general,
modules with Zsummary scores above 10 are interpreted
as strongly preserved (that is, densely connected, distinct
and reproducible modules), Zsummary scores between 2
and 10 are weak to moderately preserved and Zsummary
scores below 2 are not preserved.
Assessing enrichment in rare de novo mutations in
neurodevelopmental disorder
DNM reported in published neurodevelopmental trio
WES studies were collated: EE (n = 356) [13, 14], ASD
(n = 4186) [90, 91], SCZ (n = 1004) [61, 92–95] ID (n = 192)
[96–98] and DDD (n = 1133) [99, 100]. For controls, we
used 1891 non-neurological control samples from seven
published studies [61, 63, 90, 94, 96, 101, 102].
To integrate these data though their variable sources
and coverage, we assumed each gene has 100% of its
CDDS sequence covered across all trios, as previously
described [25]. For each disorder, we included SNV
DNM considering all missense, nonsense and splice-site
SNV mutations. We adopted a FET (two-tail) to empir-
ically compare the rates of DNMs overlapping the CCDS
real estate of a module in case- and control cohorts. The
code of the in-house R function to compute enrichment
in DNMs is available at https://github.com/adelahay/
BrainCell (DNMFET function).
Protein-protein interaction network analysis
First, to test the enrichment of PPI among protein prod-
ucts of M30 genes, we used the tool provided in the ver-
sion 10.0 of STRING database [49]. The enrichment was
calculated selecting known interactions (experimentally
determined and from curated databases). Second, we
tested M30 for enrichment in PPI using the DAPPLE
module [50, 51] of the GenePattern platform [52]. DAP-
PLE looks for significant physical connectivity among
proteins encoded for by genes according to protein-
protein interactions reported in the InWeb database
[103]. Then, we collated protein-protein interactions
(PPI) from three different databases: GeneMANIA [53],
Hippie [54] and iRefWeb [55]. We created 100,000 ran-
dom gene sets that each contained 320 different genes
expressed in the UKBEC dataset (320 corresponding to
the number of genes of M30). PPI networks were con-
structed for M30 module and for each gene set and we
used these simulated networks to generate normal distri-
butions of PPI networks. The P value for enrichment of
genes involved in PPI was estimated by the proportion
of control networks with more genes involved in PPI
network than the 142 ones of M30.
GWAS-enrichment analysis
To test for enrichment of genetic association in a gene-
set (i.e. co-expression module) we used versatile gene-
based association study (VEGAS2) [104] to generate a
gene-based association statistic (P value) controlled for
the number of SNPs in each gene and the LD between
those SNPs. In all analyses gene-based P values were cal-
culated using VEGAS2 and the top 10% option with
100,000 iterations and a gene window consisting of the
transcriptional start and stop position of each gene. For
the ILAE Consortium on Complex Epilepsies and the
control GWAS datasets of waist-hip ratio, fasting insulin
homeostasis,
glucose
challenge
homeostasis,
systolic
blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, the default
1000 Genomes European population was used to control
for LD in the VEGAS2 analysis. The GWAS-enrichment
statistic was calculated for the tested modules from the
gene-based association P values (from VEGAS2) using
the Z-test based bootstrapping method [105] (one-sided)
where, for each network, 100,000 random gene sets of
same size as the network were sampled from the list of
all brain regions expressed genes (n = 15,199). We tested
enrichment M30 module for association to several disease
traits and used FDR method to account for the number of
tests.
Enrichment in differential expressed genes between cases
and controls in epileptic patients and mice models of
epilepsy
Differential expression analysis was performed in three
datasets (see Additional file 2: Table S2). For human
microarray hippocampus expression dataset E-MTAB-
3123 (24 TLE patients/23 controls, https://www.ebi.a-
c.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3123/[90]), the
differential expression analysis of the adjusted dataset
was performed using the limma package [106]. The
mouse datasets were annotated with human Ensembl
gene ID using the biomaRt Bioconductor R package
[88, 89] and selecting human genes that were ‘one-to-
one’ orthologues with mouse genes. The package EdgeR
[107] was used for differential analysis of RNA-seq
mouse hippocampus datasets for both models, the pilo-
carpine mouse model (100 cases/100 controls) and the
Dravet syndrome mouse model (4 cases/ 4 controls).
The pilocarpine mouse model is a mouse model of tem-
poral lobe epilepsy (TLE), where the mice develop spon-
taneous recurrent seizures (SRS) (i.e. epilepsy) a few
weeks following the induction of status epilepticus (SE) by
an injection of pilocarpine [24, 58, 108]. The Dravet syn-
drome mouse model is a Scn1a knock-in mouse model
Delahaye-Duriez et al. Genome Biology  (2016) 17:245 
Page 13 of 18
 (Mouse Genome Informatics MGI:3713740) for which the
hippocampi were collected at 14 days of age, prior to the
onset of seizures [109, 110]. For the Dravet syndrome
mouse model experiments, only male mice were selected
and healthy littermate mice were used as controls.
We multiplied the adjusted P value (the –log10 of P
value) by the log-transformed fold change to generate a
gene-level score, which was used as a metric to ‘rank’
genes. This gene-level score reflects the significance and
the intensity of differential expression. Gene set enrich-
ment analysis (GSEA) [57] was then used to test if a group
of genes (genes from respective co-expression module) oc-
cupy higher (or lower) positions in the ranked gene list
than what it would be expected by chance. Gene set en-
richment scores and significance level of the enrichment
(NES, P value, FDR) and enrichment plots were provided
in the GSEA output format developed by Broad Institute
of MIT and Harvard (permutations = 100,000).
Enrichment in transcripts anti-correlated with frequency
of seizure in the pilocarpine mouse model
To this aim, we used data obtained from 14 days of con-
tinuous video monitoring of behavioural seizures in the
mouse model of TLE beginning 28 days following pilo-
carpine induced SE) [24, 58]. For all genes, the Spearman
correlation coefficient between the number of seizures
and the level of its expression was calculated using the
cor.test function in the stat R-package. We multiplied
the –log10 of P values by the correlation coefficients of
each Spearman’s test to generate a gene-level score,
which was used as a metric as described above to ‘rank’
genes. GSEA [57] was applied to the genome-wide
ranked list of gene scores to test for enrichment of cor-
related genes or anti-correlated genes in the set of M30
genes.
Spatiotemporal analysis of module expression
To determine the spatiotemporal expression dynamics
of modules, we used quantile normalised gene level ex-
pression values (log2 transformed) from GSE25219 [32].
These transcriptome data were generated using Affyme-
trix Human Exon 1.0 ST array analysis of 16 brain re-
gions comprising the cerebellar cortex, mediodorsal
nucleus of the thalamus, striatum, amygdala, hippocam-
pus and 11 areas of the neocortex. The data were gener-
ated from 1263 samples collected from 53 clinically
unremarkable post-mortem human brains, spanning em-
bryonic development to late adulthood (from 10 weeks
of post-conception to 82 years of age, which corre-
sponded to periods 3–15, as previously designated) [32].
The log2-transformed gene expression data follow a bi-
modal distribution contributed by low (likely non-
functional) and high expressed genes [111]. We used
the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm to model
gene expression levels as a mixture of normal distribu-
tions and identify the underlying distributions of low
and high expressed genes. Only the genes, with mean of
log2-transformed expression values over the 95 % percentile
of distribution of low-expressed genes (here > 5.61) were
considered for further analysis (n = 8704). The EM algo-
rithm was implemented using normalMixEM function
from the mixtools R package. Spatio-temporal dynamics of
co-expression modules M1 and M3 across 16 brain regions
and 13 developmental time points were illustrated as a
heatmap, as previously described [33]. Module expression
for each region and developmental time point was calcu-
lated by averaging the scaled expression across all genes in
a module. The resultant heatmap graphs illustrate the
changes in expression of genes of a co-expression module
across brain development and cortical regions. The
code of the in-house R function to build spatiotemporal
heatmap is available at https://github.com/adelahay/
BrainCell (BrainH function).
Cell-type analysis
A publicly available set of cell-type marker genes was
used to determine whether the network is enriched for
genes specific to a particular cell type [41]. Marker genes
were defined as preferentially expressed in a particular
cell type, using single cell RNA-seq from mouse cortex
and hippocampus for nine cell types [41]. All expressed
background genes used to build these sets of marker
genes were annotated with human ENSG gene ID using
the biomaRt Bioconductor R package [88, 89] selecting
‘one-to-one’ orthologues. Module enrichment for each
cell type was performed using FET to empirically com-
pare the rate of genes overlapping the cell-type marker
genes within and outside the module. The code of the
in-house R function to compute enrichment in cell-type
marker genes is available at https://github.com/adelahay/
BrainCell (CellFET function).
To evaluate the pattern of expression of the M30
genes across cell types, we also used another single-cell
RNA-seq mouse brain dataset [42]. The processed and
normalised gene level expression values (reads per kilo-
base par million mapped reads (RPKM)) from GSE71585
[42]. We selected the 1424 single-cell data that were
classified consistently into one of the 49 cell types
(core cells). To display the changes of expression
across cell types, the expression in one cell type was
calculated by averaging the expression of all cells of
this cell type. The M30 genes average expression
values were then scaled and plotted as a heatmap to
show the change of gradients across cell types. The
code of the in-house R function to build the cell-type
heatmap is available at https://github.com/adelahay/

 Drug repurposing analysis
We analysed Connectivity Map (CMap, build 02, http://
www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/)
dataset
that
collected
from four human cell lines treated with ~1300 drugs,
including many Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved, in different concentrations. Here, genome-
wide expression profiling was conducted after 6 h using
the Human Affymetrix U133 microarray platform. Raw
microarray data from CMap were downloaded and
processed using systematic analysis of the impact of
custom (CDF) on GeneChip data analysis [112, 113],
RMA method as implemented in the ‘affy’ R-package
[114], and were normalised using variance stabilisation
with the ‘vsn’ R-package [115]. We selected drugs for
which data were available in at least one replicate and
performed differential expression analysis between ex-
pression profile in cells with the drug and control cells
using the limma package [106]. After filtering of signifi-
cant differentially expressed genes with a cutoff at 10 %
FDR, we obtained lists of significantly upregulated and/
or downregulated genes for 152 drugs in at least one of
the three major cell lines of CMap (HL60, human pro-
myelocytic leukaemia cell line; MCF7, human breast
adenocarcinoma cell line; PC3, human prostate cancer
cell line). For each drug, we tested the overlap of M30
genes with the list of genes upregulated by that drug
using one-tail FET (in order to prioritise drugs pre-
dicted to reverse the downregulation of M30 genes ob-
served in epileptic hippocampi). We then used the BH
method to correct the P values for multiple hypotheses
testing [116].
Replication of enrichment in valproic acid induced
upregulated genes
To replicate the predicted significant upregulation of
M30 by VPA using CMap, we utilised gene expression
data in neurons (Gene Expression Omnibus accession
GSE50215). Here, genome-wide gene expression data
were generated on day 16 neurons differentiated from
mESC before and after treatment with sodium valproate
(the sodium salt of VPA) using Affymetrix Mouse Gene
1.0 ST Array. Gene expression data were obtained from
three biological replicates of vehicle (PBS) and VPA-
treated cells. Here again, raw microarray data were
processed using custom CDF [112, 113, 117], the RMA
method as provided in the ‘affy’ R-package [114] and
normalised using variance stabilisation with the ‘vsn’ R-
package [115], differential expression analysis using the
limma package [106]. Mouse genes were mapped to
human one-to-one orthologues (5540 Ensemble gene
names). The significance of the overlap between genes
upregulated by VPA and genes in M30 genes was calcu-
lated as above.
