Aims
Aircraft noise causes endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Transportation noise increases the
incidence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and stroke. The underlying mechanisms are not well under-
stood. Herein, we investigated effects of phagocyte-type NADPH oxidase (Nox2) knockout and different noise pro-
tocols (around-the-clock, sleep/awake phase noise) on vascular and cerebral complications in mice.

Methods
and results
C57BL/6j and Nox2-/- (gp91phox-/-) mice were exposed to aircraft noise (maximum sound level of 85dB(A), average
sound pressure level of 72dB(A)) around-the-clock or during sleep/awake phases for 1, 2, and 4 days. Adverse effects of
around-the-clock noise on the vasculature and brain were mostly prevented by Nox2 deficiency. Around-the-clock air-
craft noise of the mice caused the most pronounced vascular effects and dysregulation of Foxo3/circadian clock as
revealed by next generation sequencing (NGS), suggesting impaired sleep quality in exposed mice. Accordingly, sleep but
not awake phase noise caused increased blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction, increased markers of vascular/systemic
oxidative stress, and inflammation. Noise also caused cerebral oxidative stress and inflammation, endothelial and neuron-
al nitric oxide synthase (e/nNOS) uncoupling, nNOS mRNA and protein down-regulation, and Nox2 activation. NGS
revealed similarities in adverse gene regulation between around-the-clock and sleep phase noise. In patients with estab-
lished coronary artery disease, night-time aircraft noise increased oxidative stress, and inflammation biomarkers in serum.

Introduction
Transportation noise is becoming recognized as a cardiovascular risk
factor (for review, see Refs1,2). Numerous studies indicate that con-
tinuous road, railway, and aircraft noise is associated with a significant
increase in arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure,
and stroke (for review, see Refs3–5). Simulation of night-time aircraft
noise (for one night) causes stress and endothelial dysfunction in
healthy subjects6 and patients with established coronary artery dis-
ease,7 likely due to increased production of vascular reactive oxygen
species (ROS).8 Importantly, night-time noise is more likely to cause
cardiovascular disease than daytime noise,9–11 a phenomenon,
that may be linked to activation of metabolic, endocrine,12 and immune
pathways.13 Sleep restriction14 or fragmentation15 causes endothelial
dysfunction and increases cerebral oxidative stress and increases
cardiovascular mortality,16 likely due to increased NADPH oxidase
(mainly Nox2) activation. Chronic aircraft noise also causes learning
and memory impairment in children,17 all of which may be linked to an
activation of the cerebral Nox2.18 In addition, Nox2 knockout mice
were protected against endothelial dysfunction in numerous cardio-
vascular disease models including experimental hypertension.19
Thus, with these studies we sought to determine
(1)
the vascular and cerebral consequences of sleep (reflecting night-
time noise) vs. awake phase aircraft noise,
(2)
the role of Nox2 in aircraft noise-induced vascular and cerebral oxi-
dative stress by using a Nox2-/- (gp91phox-/-) knockout mouse,
(3)
the impact of aircraft noise on circadian clock gene regulation, and
(4)
as a translational approach, to investigate for the first time whether
night-time aircraft noise increases oxidative stress biomarkers in
humans.
Materials and methods
Noise exposure
All human data was collected in accordance with the declaration of
Helsinki and Ethical approval was granted by the Landesa
¨rztekammer
Rheinland-Pfalz (Mainz, Germany; permit number: 837.190.12 (8291-F)).
Written consent was received from all included individuals. Human
data are previously unpublished results of the FLuG-Risiko study.7
Serum of each individual was sampled after nights without or with aircraft
noise exposure for 6 h. The aircraft noise consisted of 60 repetitive
noise events, which had been recorded near Du
¨sseldorf airport, inter-
rupted by random silent periods, yielding a mean sound pressure level
of 47dB(A) (compared to 39dB(A) in the silent nights). The detailed
protocol and health status of included individuals was published
previously.7
All animals were treated in accordance with the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted by the U.S. National Institutes
of Health and approval was granted by the Ethical Committee of the
University Medical Center Mainz and the Landesuntersuchungsamt
Rheinland-Pfalz (Koblenz, Germany; permit number: 23 177-07/G 15-1-
094). After the indicated duration and protocol of noise exposure,
animals were killed under isoflurane anaesthesia by transection of the dia-
phragm and removal of the heart and thoracic aorta. Glucose levels were
assessed in whole blood using the ACCU-CHEK Sensor system from
Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany).
For detailed description of all methods, see Supplementary material
online.
Results
Effects of Nox2 (gp91phox) deficiency on
vascular function and systemic oxidative
stress caused by continuous noise
exposure (24 h/day) for 1, 2, and 4 days
Animals were exposed to aircraft noise around-the-clock for 1, 2,
and 4 days. This induced endothelial dysfunction in wild-type mice on
all exposure days, whereas in Nox2-/- (gp91phox-/-) mice endothelial
function was preserved (Figure 1A and B), while endothelium-
independent relaxation in Nox2-/- mice was slightly impaired (see
Supplementary material online, Figure S1). Blood glucose levels
increased on Day 1 of noise exposure in wild type but not in Nox2-/-
mice (Figure 1C). Plasma levels of malondialdehyde- and 3-nitrotyro-
sine-positive proteins, markers of systemic oxidative stress, and
Translational perspective
Noise leads to annoyance, a form of mental stress that is associated with pathophysiological changes such as a pro-atherothrombotic phenotype and
increased incidence of cardiovascular events and disease. This study is the first to demonstrate (i) increased markers of oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion in noise-exposed patients with established coronary artery disease, (ii) an impact of sleep vs. awake phase aircraft noise exposure on the vascula-
ture, (iii) the stimulatory effects of aircraft noise on cerebral superoxide production by uncoupled neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) as well as
induction of a neuroinflammatory phenotype, and (iv) the protective effects of Nox2 deletion on aircraft noise-induced vascular dysfunction, cerebral
superoxide production, and neuroinflammation. Thus, these results may explain at least in part why sleep phase rather than awake phase noise leads
to cardiovascular diseases and may also provide an explanation why aircraft noise is linked with cognitive impairment including retardations of learning
and memory capabilities.

 Figure 1 Effects of continuous noise exposure (24 h/day) on blood glucose, vascular function, systemic oxidative stress, and gene regulation (next
generation sequencing data) in wild-type and Nox2-/- (gp91phox-/-) mice. Around the clock noise exposure (24 h/day) impaired endothelial function
significantly (A and B) and increased blood glucose (C) in wild-type mice. The endothelium-independent relaxation (NTG response) is shown in
Supplementary material online, Figure S1. Levels of 3-nitrotyrosine- and malondialdehyde-positive proteins were significantly increased in mouse
plasma in wild-type mice (D and E). Circulating IL-6 in mouse plasma was significantly elevated in wild-type mice (F). Representative dot blots are
shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S2. Vascular ROS formation as envisaged by DHE staining was increased in noise-exposed wild-type
mice (G). None of the parameters were changed in around-the-clock noise exposed Nox2-/- (gp91phox-/-) mice. Noise-induced aortic superoxide for-
mation as measured by HPLC analysis was higher by trend in wild type than in Nox2-/- (gp91phox-/-) mice (H). Representative HPLC chromatograms
are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S24. The pie chart and box/scatter plots summarize the number of genes that are significantly and
tissue-independently regulated (I). Changes of transcriptional profiles were determined by next generation sequencing in aorta, heart, and kidney of
mice exposed to aircraft noise and unexposed controls. Clustering of genes in heat maps revealed tissue-conserved transcriptional changes in the cir-
cadian clock pathway (J). Most significantly up- or down-regulated genes for all tissues can be found in Supplementary material online, Tables S1–S5.
Data are presented as mean± SD from n = 14–15 (A and B) or 6 (C) animals/group, at least three samples/group (pooled from 2 to 3 mice/sample)
(D–F), 4–6 WT and 7–8 gp91phox-/- (G), and 4 mice/group (H–J). (A and B) Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA comparing the
values of the entire curves; *P < 0.05 vs. control without noise at the same ACh concentration (as indicated by colour code). (H) Unpaired t-test with
Welch’s correction was used. For all other data: normality test passed and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction was used. lfcMLE means Log2
fold change with the unshrunken maximum likelihood estimate (MLE).

circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly increased
(Figure 1D–F, for original blots see Supplementary material online,
Figure S2). Oxidative burst in whole blood was augmented in noise-
exposed wild type but not in Nox2-/- mice (see Supplementary mater-
ial online, Figure S1). Aortic ROS formation was increased by around-
the-clock noise exposure and normalized by Nox2 deficiency (Figure
1G and H). In contrast to our previous observations,8 the cGMP-
dependent kinase-1 (cGK-I) activity (=P-VASP), protein levels of
endothelin-1 (ET-1), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were not modi-
fied in aorta of aircraft noise-exposed Nox2 (gp91phox) deficient
mice pointing to the crucial role of Nox2 in noise-triggered vascular
damage (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3).
Noise-induced changes in circadian clock
genes assessed by next generation
sequencing
Comparative analysis of the transcriptome of aortic tissue from
around-the-clock aircraft noise-treated animals vs. controls showed
numerous differentially expressed genes. Recently, we identified
224 transcripts that were either up- or down-regulated over the
entire exposure period (applying a threshold of P < 0.05 and Log2
fold change >
_0.5).8 Several of these regulated genes are involved in
essential cellular processes such as apoptosis, fibrosis, proliferation,
antioxidant defence, and inflammation, with FOXO transcription fac-
tors representing a central signalling hub.8 Herein, we report that
around-the-clock exposure to aircraft noise regulates almost 2000
genes in aorta (see pie chart as well as box/scatter plots in Figure 1I)
and induces transcriptional changes in circadian rhythm (see heat
map in Figure 1J), inflammation and oxidative stress response (see
heat maps in Supplementary material online, Figure S4) in three differ-
ent tissues (aorta, heart, and kidney) (see also Supplementary material
online, Tables S1–S3). Most significant similarities in the transcriptional
changes between the different tissues were found for circadian
rhythm, which led us to assess the circadian clock system in more de-
tail. Key changes in the aorta comprised impaired insulin signalling and
down-regulation of Foxo3 expression, with significant impact on
Npas2, Arntl, Clock, Bmal1, Cry1, Per1, Prlag1/2, Cul1, NR1D1/2, and
Rora all genes of the circadian clock pathway, as identified by bioinfor-
matic procedures (see Supplementary material online, Figure S5). At
least the Bmal1 promoter has a direct binding site for FOXO3.
Since circadian clock dysregulation seemed to be centred
around Foxo3 we tested the effect of the FOXO3 activator bepridil,20
a calcium antagonist, anti-anginal, and class IV anti-arrhythmic drug.
Bepridil prevented noise-induced endothelial dysfunction, increased
Foxo3 mRNA expression and prevented vascular/cerebral oxidative
stress (see Supplementary material online, Figure S6).
Effects of Nox2 (gp91phox) deficiency on
cerebral oxidative stress and
inflammation caused by around-the-clock
aircraft noise
Around-the-clock aircraft noise increased ROS [dihydroethidium
(DHE) cryo staining] in the frontal cortex of the brain, an effect
that was severely blunted in Nox2-/- (gp91phox-/-) mice (Figure 2A).
L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) increased ROS formation
in the frontal cortex of the control group while decreasing it in noise-
exposed animals, compatible with an uncoupled nitric oxide synthase
(NOS) (Figure 2B), as described already for the vasculature.8 Using
the highly specific inhibitor of nNOS (NOS1), ARL-17477, we identi-
fied uncoupled nNOS as a significant cerebral source of ROS forma-
tion (Figure 2C), while white noise had no adverse effects at all (see
Supplementary material online, Figure S7).
Aircraft noise caused a down-regulation of nNOS in whole brain
homogenate at the mRNA (significant) and the protein levels (by
trend) (Figure 2D and E), which was prevented by genetic Nox2 dele-
tion. nNOS phosphorylation at serine 847, which was reported to
cause nNOS inactivation and to be associated with nNOS uncou-
pling,21,22 was increased in the frontal cortex upon exposure to noise
(see Supplementary material online, Figure S8). Increased cerebral oxi-
dative stress was observed in wild type but not Nox2-/- mice (Figure 2F
and G). In the noise-exposed wild-type mice, cerebral oxidative stress
was mainly derived from increased Nox2 activity secondary to activa-
tion by protein kinase C [increased phospho-MARCKS and p47phox
phosphorylation at Ser328 (see Supplementary material online, Figure
S9)] and due to nNOS uncoupling.
We also established increased mRNA expression of the inflamma-
tion markers inducible NOS, CD68, and IL-6 but decreased antioxi-
dant defence gene catalase upon noise, all of which was prevented by
Nox2 deletion (Figure 2H; 50 most significantly up- or down-regulated
genes in brain are shown in Supplementary material online, Tables S4
and S5). On Day 4, Nox2 was replaced as the significant superoxide
source in the brain by mitochondria (Figure 2I, Supplementary mater-
ial online, Figure S10).
Effects of sleep/awake phase noise on
selected genes
Recently, we identified eight potential risk marker genes that respond
to continuous aircraft noise by next generation sequencing (NGS).8
Among the four most strongly up-regulated genes was Indian
Hedgehog (Ihh), which is involved in cellular signalling, cartilage degen-
eration, and in TGFb-driven processes.23,24 Aircraft noise during the
sleep phase increased vascular Ihh gene expression to a greater extent
than exposure during the awake phase in accordance with an increase
in Ihh in aorta of mice exposed for 4 days to around-the-clock noise
(see Supplementary material online, Figure S11A). The markers of
endothelial cell activation and inflammation, Nos2 and Vcam1, were
increased at the mRNA level in cardiac tissue, mostly of sleep phase
or around-the-clock noise exposed mice (see Supplementary material
online, Figure S11B and C), supporting the recently reported inflamma-
tory phenotype in vessels of aircraft noise-exposed animals.8 We fur-
ther confirmed the above-reported NGS data of previous and the
present study by quantitative analysis of three selected genes of the
postulated circadian clock pathway in Supplementary material online,
Figure S5 using RT–PCR. Arntl was somewhat stronger up-regulated
by exposure to noise during the sleep phase in accordance to 4 days
exposure to around-the-clock aircraft noise (see Supplementary ma-
terial online, Figure S11D). Foxo3 was down-regulated by exposure to
noise during the sleep phase in accordance to 4 days exposure to
around-the-clock aircraft noise (see Supplementary material online,
Figure S11E). Parp1 was increased on almost all days in response to
awake/sleep phase and around-the-clock aircraft noise exposure (see
Supplementary material online, Figure S11F).

 Figure 2 Effects of continuous noise (24 h/day) on cerebral oxidative stress and inflammation in wild type and Nox2-/- (gp91phox-/-) mice. Around
the clock noise (24 h/day) increased oxidative stress in the cortex of wild-type mice significantly, whereas Nox2-/- (gp91phox-/-) mice were protected
on the first two exposure days (A). Modulation of the ROS signal by L-NAME was used to identify ROS formation coming from uncoupled NOS (B).
Representative minimized cerebral cryo-stainings of DHE fluorescence microtopography are shown below the quantification. Supplementary mater-
ial online, Figures S24 and S25 show the full images and higher magnification as well as stainings of the entire brain. Modulation of the ROS signal by
ARL-17477 was used to identify ROS formation coming from uncoupled nNOS (C). Cerebral nNOS expression was quantified at the protein and
mRNA level in wild type and Nox2 deficient mice (D and E). Representative original western blots are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure
S24. Noise-induced superoxide formation in frontal cortex as measured by HPLC analysis was significantly higher in WT than in Nox2�/� (gp91phox-/-)
mice and whole brain tissue without frontal cortex showed the same trend (F and G). Representative HPLC chromatograms and full images of
the representative DHE stainings are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S24, respectively. Markers of inflammation (iNOS, CD68, IL-
6) were increased and catalase was decreased at the mRNA level by noise, all of which was prevented by Nox2 deficiency (H). Cryo-sections of
the frontal cortex were stained with mitoSOX red (1 mM) for detection of mitochondrial ROS formation (I). Representative full size staining
images for all groups are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S10. Data are presented as mean ± SD from n = 8 (A and B), at least 5
(C and D), 4 (F–H), and 7–8 (I) mice/group. (I) Normality test failed and non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s correction was used.
(C) Paired and (F, G) unpaired t-test was used. For all other data: normality test passed and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction was used.

The changes in aircraft noise exposure-induced gene expression
patterns were also supported by NGS data (see pie chart as well as
box/scatter plots in Figure 3A), identifying key genes in cell cycle, tran-
scription, inflammatory response, and circadian rhythm (Ypel2, Ihh,
Per1, Adamts1, Nfkbia, Ccr5, Figure 3B and 27 more genes with a pie
chart summary in Supplementary material online, Figures S12 and S13;
50 most significantly up- or down-regulated genes in Supplementary
material online, Tables S6–S8).
Effects of sleep/awake phase noise on
haemodynamics, vascular function, and
the •NO/cGMP signalling pathway
Four days of aircraft noise exposure during both the sleep and
awake phases increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure
significantly although noise exposure during the sleep phase had a
more pronounced effect than awake phase exposures (Figure 4A
and B; for time-dependence see Supplementary material online,
Figure S14). Sleep phase but not awake phase noise caused endothe-
lial dysfunction, impaired endothelium-independent relaxation by
nitroglycerin (Figure 4C and D and Supplementary material online,
Figure S15) and increased vascular expression of ET-1 (Figure 4E).
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an increase in ET-1 staining
mainly within the endothelium (Figure 4F and see Supplementary
material online, Figure S16). Likewise, an increase in serum
leptin levels was observed (see Supplementary material online,
Figure S17).
Sleep phase noise caused an up-regulation of eNOS expression
over 1–4 days of noise and significant elevation of phosphorylation
Figure 3 Effects of noise during the sleep or awake phase (12 h/day) on gene expression (NGS). The pie chart as well as box/scatter plots summarize
the number of genes that are significantly and noise protocol-independently regulated in aortic tissue (A). NGS data for the three noise exposure proto-
cols were used to identify genes that are similarly regulated in response to around-the-clock or sleep phase aircraft noise for 4 days (B). Most significantly
up- or down-regulated genes (in aorta) for awake and sleep phase as well as around-the-clock noise can be found in Supplementary material online,
Tables S1–S3 and S6–S9. Data are presented as mean± SD from four samples in control group, five samples in sleep or awake group (each pooled from
four mice) (B). Another 27 genes with high regulatory similarity between around-the-clock or sleep phase aircraft noise for 4 days and a summary of
these comparisons can be found in Supplementary material online, Figures S12 and S13. (B, Ihh): Normality test failed and non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis
test with Dunn’s correction was used. For all other data: normality test passed and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction was used.

 Figure 4 Effects of noise during the sleep or awake phase (12 h/day) on blood pressure, vascular function, endothelin-1 levels, and vascular oxidative
stress. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was increased after sleep and awake phase noise. The increase of blood pressure was more pronounced
after sleep phase noise (A and B). Time-dependent changes of blood pressure for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days of noise are shown in Supplementary material on-
line, Figure S14. Relaxation by the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh) was impaired by sleep phase but not awake phase noise
(C and D). The dashed lines are reproduced data of Figure 1A above as reference values of mice exposed to around-the-clock aircraft noise for 4days.
The endothelium-independent relaxation (NTG response) is shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S15. Noise during the sleep phase but not
the awake phase caused an increase in the expression ET-1 in aortic tissue (E). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that noise during the sleep phase
but not the awake phase enhanced vascular ET-1 levels on Day 1, mainly within the endothelium (F). Representative stained images and original blots
are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S16. In vascular tissue, sleep but not awake phase noise increased ROS production as revealed by
DHE cryo staining (G, all staining images and quantification in Supplementary material online, Figure S19). Noise-induced aortic superoxide formation as
measured by HPLC analysis was higher in the sleep than in the awake phase noise group (H). Representative HPLC chromatograms are shown in
Supplementary material online, Figure S26. ROS production in the endothelial cell layer was increased in aortic segments of animals exposed to sleep
phase noise but not awake phase noise and treatment with the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME exerted opposing effects on endothelial superoxide produc-
tion in the sleep (rather down) vs. awake (rather up) phase noise groups on all days (I). Sleep phase but not awake phase noise lead to a substantial in-
crease in S-glutathionylation of eNOS (J). Representative stained images and western blots are shown below the densitometric quantification. Data are
presented as mean± SD from n= 5 (A and B), 15–20 (C and D) mice per group, 6–8 samples (pooled from 2 to 3 mice per sample) (E), and 6–8 (F), 4–6
(H), and 6–10 (I, J) mice/group. Two-way ANOVA (C and D); *P< 0.05 vs. control without noise at the same ACh concentration (as indicated by color
code). (A and I) Normality test failed and non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s correction was used. (H) Unpaired t-test was used. For all
other data: normality test passed and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction was used.

of eNOS at Ser1177 (see Supplementary material online, Figure S18A
and B) and an increase in protein levels of GTP-cyclohydrolase-1
(GCH-1) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), both being respon-
sible for providing the eNOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)
(see Supplementary material online, Figure S18C and D). The •NO/
cGMP/cGK-I signalling pathway was not impaired (data not shown)
suggesting that the observed eNOS uncoupling in the present
studies is not due to a deficit of BH4 synthesis or recycling, but rather
related to eNOS glutathionylation and increased oxidative break-
down of BH4.
Effects of sleep/awake noise on systemic
and vascular oxidative stress and
inflammation
In vascular tissue, noise exposure increased the global aortic ROS
production being more pronounced in the sleep phase noise com-
pared to the awake phase noise group (Figure 4G, H and
Supplementary material online, Figure S19). DHE staining revealed
that endothelial ROS production was increased by exposure to
noise during the sleep phase and treatment with the eNOS inhibitor
L-NAME had differential effects on endothelial superoxide produc-
tion in sleep vs. awake phase noise groups, identifying eNOS as a
significant superoxide source (Figure 4I). This was confirmed by
the substantial increase in S-glutathionylation of eNOS in response
to sleep phase noise (Figure 4J). Sleep but not awake phase noise
increased mRNA of inflammation markers (iNOS, MCP-1, and
CD68) in the aorta (see Supplementary material online, Figures S20
and S21). In the plasma, noise exposure during the sleep phase
increased
malondialdehyde-positive
proteins,
3-nitrotyrosine-
positive proteins, and interleukin-6 as established by dot blot
measurements (see Supplementary material online, Figures S22 and
S23).
Effects of sleep/awake aircraft noise on
oxidative stress and inflammation in the
brain
Aircraft noise during the sleep for 4 days increased cerebral cellular
and mitochondrial ROS formation stronger than noise during the
awake phase (Figure 5A and B). Cellular ROS formation was signifi-
cantly
blocked
by
the
previously
described
Nox2
inhibitor
GSK2795039.25 The inflammatory and pro-oxidative phenotype in
sleep phase noise-exposed mice was also evident by increased glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytic processes and ac-
cumulation of astrocytes in the corpus callosum (CC) (Figure 5C).26,27
Microglia staining by ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1
(Iba1) showed homogenously distributed ramified microglia through-
out the brain (not shown) but this does not necessarily mean that
their function was not altered by noise since even microglia with ap-
parently similar morphologies may exhibit diverse molecular and
functional phenotypes.28 mRNA levels of protective genes (nNOS,
Foxo3, and catalase) were down-regulated and mRNA expression of
ROS generating Nox1 as well as markers of inflammation in the brain
of mice upon noise were up-regulated during the sleep but not the
awake phase (Figure 5D).
Evidence for noise-induced oxidative
stress in human subjects
Noise exposure (simulated aircraft noise for 6 h, peak SPL 60 dB(A),
mean SPL 47 dB(A)) caused a significant increase in 3-nitrotyrosine-
positive proteins and 8-isoprostane concentrations in serum of
human subjects (Figure 6A and B). Markers of inflammation such as IL-
1b (by trend) and IL-18 were also found increased (Figure 6C and D).
Discussion
With this study, we sought to determine the vascular and cerebral
consequences of chronic aircraft noise when applied around-the-
clock, during the awake phase and sleep phase (reflecting night time
noise) for 1, 2, and 4 days. We could demonstrate that aircraft noise
increased oxidative stress in the vasculature and the brain (mainly in
the frontal cortex), caused cerebral nNOS down-regulation, all of
which was almost completely prevented by Nox2 (gp91phox) dele-
tion. Importantly, we established that noise during the sleep but not
during the awake phase makes the difference. Mainly noise applied
during the sleep phase comparable to night-time noise in humans
caused endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and inflam-
mation within plasma, the heart and the vasculature and induced
eNOS uncoupling.
In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that aircraft
noise increases oxidative stress in the brain that is at least in part
mediated by nNOS uncoupling and Nox2, all of which induces a
neuroinflammatory phenotype as reflected by substantial astro-
cyte activation. Adverse gene regulation, as revealed by NGS in
the aorta, kidney, heart, and brain, seems to be a key mechanism
of noise-induced cardiovascular and cerebral damage. We here
identified dysregulated circadian rhythm in different tissues, cen-
tered around Foxo3 down-regulation, which also adversely
affects oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways. The link be-
tween adverse cerebral effects of noise and the subsequent car-
diovascular damage is most likely based on detrimental stress
hormone signalling as shown in animals8,29 and men.6
Aircraft noise and cardiovascular disease
An increasing portion of the population is exposed to aircraft, rail
and road traffic noise and the evidence that transportation noise rep-
resents a significant cardiovascular risk factor has increased substan-
tially. Noise leads to an increased incidence of cardiovascular
diseases including coronary artery disease, stroke, and arterial hyper-
tension30–34 and increases in the risk of diabetes mellitus type 2,35
and obesity30 development. Recent translational studies provided
some mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology underlying aircraft
noise-induced cardiovascular disease. Night-time of aircraft noise
simulation stimulated the release of stress hormones such as adren-
aline and caused endothelial dysfunction in healthy volunteers6 and
patients with established coronary artery disease7 and as expected
the deterioration of endothelial function was stronger in patients
with established coronary artery disease as compared to healthy sub-
jects.5 Importantly, endothelial dysfunction was markedly improved
via acute administration of the antioxidant vitamin C pointing to
increased production of ROS in the vasculature.6 With the present
studies we can expand these observations by demonstrating for the
Nox2, cerebral ROS, and sleep deprivation by noise

 Figure 5 Effects of sleep and awake phase noise (12 h/day for 4 days) on cerebral oxidative stress, inflammation, and gene regulation. Sleep phase
noise caused a more pronounced increase in ROS formation in the frontal cortex than awake phase noise and this signal was blocked by Nox inhib-
ition (DHE staining for cytoplasmic ROS and mitoSOX red for mitochondrial ROS, A). Representative stained images are shown together with the
densitometric quantification. Noise-induced cerebral superoxide formation as measured by HPLC analysis was higher in the sleep than in the awake
phase noise group (B). Representative HPLC chromatograms are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S26. Astrocytes were activated in
sleep phase noise exposed mice in the corpus callosum (C). Representative images for immunohistochemical staining for GFAP are shown at the level
of the hippocampus sector CA1 [corpus callosum (CC), stratum oriens (Or), pyramidale (Py), and radiatum (Rad); 4 mice/group]. Markers of inflam-
mation (iNOS, CD68 significant and IL-6, MCP-1 by trend) and ROS-producing Nox1 were increased (at least by trend), whereas the antioxidant/pro-
tective genes catalase, Foxo3, and nNOS were decreased at the mRNA level by sleep phase noise (D). Data are presented as mean± SD from at least
n = 6 (A), 9–10 (B), and at least 4 (D) mice/group. (D, Catalase): normality test failed and non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s correction
was used. (B) Unpaired t-test was used. For all other data: normality test passed and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction was used.

 Figure 6 Oxidative stress markers in serum of noise-exposed human subjects. ELISA measurements revealed increased 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT)-
positive proteins (A) and 8-isoprostane concentrations (B) in serum of human subjects. Multiplex measurements revealed increased markers of in-
flammation (IL-1b by trend, (C) IL-18 significant, (D)) in serum of human subjects. Data are presented as mean± SD. Samples from n = 18 individuals
(A and B) were compared before and after noise (aircraft noise for 6 h, mean SPL 47dB(A)) using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test.
Cytokine measurements yielded results for n = 10–12 individuals using the unpaired t-test (without (IL-1b) and with Welch’s correction (IL-18)) (C
and D). (E) Summarizing central scheme: around-the-clock and sleep phase noise triggers cerebral oxidative stress and a neuroinflammatory pheno-
type that translates the adverse effects of noise to the vascular and systemic level (e.g. by adverse stress hormone signalling and dysregulation of circa-
dian clock inducing changes in key signalling pathways). Noise via neuronal pathways triggers vascular oxidative stress and inflammation with
subsequent endothelial dysfunction, increases in blood pressure, all of which contributes the development and progression of cardiometabolic
disease.

first time that night-time aircraft noise of patients with established
coronary artery disease leads to increased biomarkers of oxidative
stress and inflammation (Figure 6).
Several studies indicate that in particular night-time aircraft noise
consistently leads to the development of stress and arterial hyperten-
sion. For example, the HYENA trial established a significant
exposure-response relationship for night-time but not daytime air-
craft noise with stress hormone levels36 and the risk for arterial
hypertension, heart disease, and stroke even after adjustment for
major confounders.37–39 A similar phenomenon was recently demon-
strated by more pronounced hypertensive effects of railway noise
when exposure was during night-time.10 In addition, Eze et al.11 estab-
lished that transportation noise may be more relevant than air
pollution in the development of diabetes, potentially acting through
noise-induced sleep disturbances. These observations are not sur-
prising since the commonly used measurements of daytime noise
have been suggested to be a source of exposure bias since during
workdays most people spend their daytime hours out of the home
and therefore night-time noise measurements might alleviate any ex-
posure bias problem.
Studies comparing separately the adverse vascular effects of night-
time vs. daytime aircraft noise are still missing. Around-the-clock air-
craft noise has been demonstrated in a novel animal model to cause a
marked increase in circulating neurohormonal stress hormones, to
cause endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular inflammation, and
oxidative stress in the plasma and within the vasculature occurred al-
ready within 1 day during a 4 days noise period.8 Enzymes being sig-
nificantly involved in increased ROS production were the NADPH
oxidase (Nox2 subunit, likely macrophages and neutrophils) and an
uncoupled eNOS.8 Importantly, identical average SPL Leq(3) of white
noise (72 dBA) were less damaging to the vasculature,8 suggesting
that other parameters than noise energy such as dynamics or the fre-
quency of the noise stimulus may be responsible for the vascular
damage.
With the results of this studies, we provide for the first time the
proof for a significant role of Nox2 for noise-triggered cerebral and
vascular damage supporting the concept that Nox2-dependent oxi-
dative stress represents an important constituent of noise-mediated
cardiovascular disease progression. Nox2 deletion normalized noise-
induced endothelial dysfunction, hyperglycemia, plasma malondialde-
hyde, 3-nitrotyrosine, IL-6 levels, and vascular superoxide produc-
tion. Also around-the-clock noise-induced adversely altered protein
(e.g. P-VASP, ET-1, HO-1) expression was normalized by Nox2
deletion.
Disturbance of sleep likely accounts for
majority of aircraft noise-induced vascu-
lar damage
Importantly, with this studies, we were able to demonstrate that
noise during the sleep (reflecting night-time noise) but not awake
phase markedly adversely affects vascular function. Sleep phase but
not awake phase noise caused endothelial dysfunction, increased vas-
cular ET-1 expression and plasma leptin levels.
Sleep phase but not awake phase noise increased vascular ROS
production and caused an uncoupling of the eNOS and increased
plasma levels of markers for oxidative stress and inflammation such
as malondialdehyde, 3-nitrotyrosine, and IL-6. Especially the increase
in L-NAME-inhibitable endothelial ROS in vessels from animals with
sleep phase noise was striking and goes parallel with observations
made in human vascular tissue where this methodology was used to
identify eNOS uncoupling in patients with an obstructive sleep ap-
noea syndrome and thus interrupted sleep.40 Of note, in that particu-
lar study the endothelial superoxide signal showed significant
correlation with impaired •NO formation in the same samples, all of
which was corrected by ex vivo treatment with eNOS cofactor BH4
and in vivo therapy by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).40
eNOS S-glutathionylation was reported as an important mechan-
ism of eNOS uncoupling,41,42 which was here substantially increased
in vessels from sleep but not awake noise exposed animals. We also
observed an increase in eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 and ex-
pression of the BH4 synthesizing and recycling enzymes GCH-1 and
DHFR, which may be interpreted as a compensatory response to
other causes of eNOS uncoupling.
In our previous studies with healthy subjects and patients with cor-
onary artery disease, exposure to 30 or 60 flight events per night, re-
spectively was paralleled by a marked decrease in sleep quality.6,7
Interestingly, 2 h of sleep deprivation for eight days has been shown
to cause endothelial dysfunction in healthy subjects, and the degree
of deterioration of endothelial function was comparable to that
observed in workers working 24-h shifts43 and in humans exposed to
chronic sleep restriction.44
Using a mouse model, Carreras et al.15 demonstrated that endo-
thelial dysfunction and arterial hypertension will develop upon ex-
posure to 20weeks of sleep deprivation. The authors observed a
marked disruption of vascular elastic fibres and an increase in foam
cells and macrophages within the vascular wall. In addition, sleep frag-
mentation reduced mRNA expression of the senescence markers
TERT and cyclin A, the tumour suppressor p16INK4 and IL-6 levels.15
The same group also demonstrated that sleep fragmentation causes
activation of the NADPH oxidase in the brain45 and increases oxida-
tive stress,46 all of which was associated with insulin resistance. All of
these features were also shared by mouse models of hypertension by
angiotensin-II infusion47,48 and, as for the part on inflammation, oxida-
tive stress, vascular dysfunction, and increases in blood pressure, also
our mouse model of aircraft noise exposure.8
Thus, a likely explanation for the development of endothelial dys-
function caused by sleep phase noise exposure may be sleep depriv-
ation and fragmentation, conditions also being linked with increased
cardiovascular events and mortality.49,50
For more detailed discussion on the effects of night-time noise ex-
posure on circadian clock pathways and vascular function, see
Supplementary material online.
Aircraft noise causes oxidative stress in
the brain
Chronic aircraft noise exposure has also been demonstrated to be
associated with cognitive impairment of children17 and also mental
disease in adults,51,52 all of which may be linked to increased oxidative
stress in the brain located primarily in the frontal cortex.53
With this studies, we can demonstrate for the first time that air-
craft noise markedly increases DHE staining and 2-hydroxyethidium
formation (detected by HPLC) in the frontal cortex of the brain (but

potentially also other brain regions). Importantly, inhibition of NOS
by L-NAME increased the DHE signal indicating that ambient levels
of NO scavenge baseline superoxide production in the brain, an
observation, which goes parallel to observations made in the vascu-
lature in the setting of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and
hypercholesterolemia.54–56 In the brain of aircraft noise exposed
animals, however, inhibition of NOS by L-NAME reduced DHE sig-
nals compatible with NOS uncoupling. To further differentiate be-
tween eNOS and nNOS uncoupling we employed the highly
specific nNOS inhibitor ARL-17477 and could demonstrate a
marked reduction in the DHE signal compatible with nNOS uncou-
pling being a significant ROS source in the frontal cortex. This ob-
servation is further supported by noise-triggered phosphorylation
of nNOS at serine 847, which causes nNOS inactivation and
increased nNOS-dependent ROS formation (uncoupling).21,22 In
addition, we established that Nox2 deletion ameliorated cerebral
ROS production in response to aircraft noise, which could also af-
fect the Ser847 phosphorylation and uncoupling of nNOS that is
redox-regulated at the level of calcium/calmodulin-dependent pro-
tein kinase.22
The location of increased oxidative stress is important because
the frontal cortex, is a critical regulator of autonomic and neuro-
endocrine stress responses57 and thus may contribute to the
development of noise-induced cognitive impairment. The simul-
taneous decrease in nNOS expression in whole brain homogenate
at the protein and mRNA level probably further contributes to
the phenomenon by removing neuroprotective basal NO forma-
tion. Interestingly, sleep deprivation has also been shown to impair
the cerebral redox balance and to cause increased cerebral oxida-
tive stress and abnormal (manic-like) behaviour and memory im-
pairment,58–60 conditions that are triggered by increased activity
of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic
activation and subsequent stress hormone production. In addition,
Nox2 (gp91phox)-mediated
increased oxidative stress was
demonstrated to play an important role for learning and memory
impairment.18 Thus, frequent awakening may cause sleep fragmen-
tation and sleep restriction that may contribute to increased oxi-
dative stress in the brain as well as to vascular damage as observed
in this investigations.
For more detailed discussion on the effects of noise exposure on
the brain see Supplementary material online.
Conclusions and clinical
implications
Noise leads to annoyance, a form of mental stress that is associated
with pathophysiological changes such as a pro-atherothrombotic
phenotype,61,62 also found in response to tangible physical stress con-
ditions such as pneumonia or myocardial infarction.63,64 This study is
the first to demonstrate (i) increased markers of oxidative stress and
inflammation in noise-exposed patients with established coronary ar-
tery disease, (ii) a significant impact of sleep vs. awake phase aircraft
noise exposure on the vasculature, (iii) the stimulatory effects of air-
craft noise on superoxide production in the brain by an uncoupled
nNOS and Nox2 as well as induction of a neuro-inflammatory
phenotype, and (iv) the protective effects of Nox2 deletion on aircraft
noise-induced vascular dysfunction, cerebral superoxide production
and neuro-inflammation. Our results clearly indicate that around-
the-clock and sleep phase but not awake phase noise cause endothe-
lial dysfunction, more inflammation and oxidative stress within
plasma, the heart, the vasculature and the frontal cortex (and poten-
tially other brain regions). It remains to be established which of these
changes are easily reversible and which are more persistent, as al-
ready
discussed
previously.8
All
these
phenomena, including
increased oxidative stress in the brain were strikingly reduced by the
deletion of the Nox2 gene indicating a key role of Nox2 for aircraft
noise-induced cerebrovascular damage.
Thus, the presented results may explain at least in part why
sleep phase rather than awake phase noise leads to cardiovascu-
lar diseases and may also provide an explanation why aircraft
noise is linked with cognitive impairment including retardations
of learning and memory capabilities in children. Thus, preventive
measures should be considered to reduce night-time aircraft
noise.65
