Abstract
Context. Compassion is frequently referenced as a hallmark of quality care by patients, health care providers, health care
administrators, and policy makers. Despite its putative centrality, including its institution in recent health care reform, an
empirical understanding based on the perspectives of patients, the recipients of compassion, is lackingdmaking compassion
one of the most referenced yet poorly understood elements of quality care.
Objectives. The objective of this study was to investigate palliative cancer patients’ understanding and experiences of
compassion to provide a critical perspective on the nature and importance of compassion.
Methods. This grounded theory study used semi-structured interviews to investigate how patients understand and
experience compassion in clinical care. Using convenience and theoretical sampling, 53 advanced cancer inpatients were
recruited over a seven-month period from a specialized palliative care unit and hospital-wide palliative care service within a
Canadian urban setting. Data were analyzed by four members of the research team through the three stages of Straussian
grounded theory.
Results. Qualitative analysis yielded seven categories, each containing distinct themes and subthemes. Together, they
constitute components of the compassion modeldthe first empirically based clinical model of compassion. The model
defines compassion as a virtuous response that seeks to address the suffering and needs of a person through relational
understanding and action.
Conclusion. The components of the compassion model provide insight into how patients understand and experience
compassion, providing the necessary empirical foundation to develop future research, measures, training, and clinical care
based on this vital feature of quality care.

Introduction
Patients, family members, health care providers,
professional bodies, and leading health care organiza-
tions identify compassion as a hallmark of quality care.
The role of compassion in health care is evident in its
prominent position within codes of patients’ rights,1
best practice guidelines,2 health care reform,1e3 and
standards of quality care.1,3,4 Compassion is promi-
nently featured in professional organizations’ codes
of ethics,5,6 including the first principle of the Amer-

 competent medical care, with compassion and respect
for human dignity and rights.’’6
Compassion has been defined as ‘‘suffering with’’
or a deep awareness of the suffering of another,
coupled with a wish to relieve it.7,8 Although the
importance of compassion is given credence across
health care, the importance that patients and family
members place on health care provider qualities
associated
with
compassion
cannot
be
easily
dismissed,9e14 particularly when facing the end of
life.15e17 Studies have reported that patients and
family members consistently identify components
of
compassion,
such
as
receiving
care
that
is
person-centered, responsive, and dialogic, as indica-
tors of quality care,2,13,16 with health care providers
and institutions characterized as compassionate be-
ing less likely to receive patient complaints and
malpractice suits.18,19 Recently, the importance of
compassion was highlighted in the Francis Inquiry
report,3 which identified a lack of compassion as a
leading cause of the failures at the Mid Staffordshire
Health Trust and within the National Health Service
in
general.
Recommendations
included
that
all
health professionals be trained in compassion, that
compassion be considered and evaluated as a core
competency
of
health
care
providers,
and
that
system-wide standards of compassionate care be
adopted and implemented. Although the relevance
of compassionate care seems self-evident, studies
have repeatedly identified the emergence of a gap
between patients’ and clinicians’ perceptions of
compassionate care.11,18e20
Although there is an extensive body of literature
within health care invoking compassion and its impor-
tance, these writings are largely theoretical, rhetorical,
anecdotal, and fail to incorporate the conceptualiza-
tions of patients21,22dthe recipients of compassionate
care. This represents a significant gap, as a compre-
hensive understanding of compassion requires consid-
eration of the sufferer’s perspective.23e26 Although
initial inquiries of patients’ perspectives of compas-
sionate health care22 and associations of compassion27
are emerging, we could only identify one small
(n ¼ 10) study that inquired about the meaning of
compassion from patients directly.28 As a result,
although the clinical relevance of compassion is in-
ferred and is one of the most liberally referenced as-
pects
of
quality
health
care,
an
empirical
understanding of compassion, including key qualities,
facilitators, and inhibitors in a clinical setting, is
lacking.23,24,29
To address these gaps, this qualitative, grounded the-
ory30 study investigated palliative cancer patients’ under-
standing and experiences of compassiondindividuals
who are ideally positioneddbased on their proximity
to suffering and extensive interaction with the health
care systemdto provide a critical perspective on the na-
ture and importance of compassion.
Methods
Study Population
Using
convenience
and
theoretical
sampling,30
data were collected from adult cancer inpatients on
a palliative care unit and a hospital palliative care
consult service at a large acute academic hospital in
Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Patients meeting eligibility
criteria were informed about the study by a member
of
the
palliative
care
team.
Eligibility
criteria
included being at least 18 years of age, able to speak
and read English, an incurable cancer diagnosis, no
demonstrable signs of confusion (as determined by
the clinical team), and a life expectancy of less
than six months. After obtaining written, informed
consent from those patients expressing interest, a
mutually agreeable interview time was arranged with
the research nurse.
From May to December 2013, 151 eligible patients
were referred to the study by palliative care staff. Of
those, 25 were too sick to participate and were, thus,
deemed ineligible. Of the remaining 126 patients,
the following reasons for nonparticipation were cited:
48 (38%) were disinterested, five (4%) were dis-
charged, and 18 (14%) died before the interview
could be conducted. Two patients who consented to
participate were excluded: one participant partially
completed the interview before being transferred to
hospice and the other was excluded because of tech-
nical difficulties with the audio recorder. We estimated
that 50 patients would be needed to reach data satura-
tion/redundancy in the data, but in actuality, a final
sample of 53 patients was required to reach this
threshold (Table 1).
Data Collection
Data were collected using face-to-face semi-struc-
tured interviews. An interview guide was developed
(Table 2) based on a literature review and our
research
team’s
previous
experience
conducting
research with patients approaching end of life.12,31,32
Interviews averaged one hour and were administered
in a private space by an experienced research nurse
who also was responsible for recruitment and data
management under the supervision of the principal
investigator. Interviews were audio-recorded and tran-
scribed verbatim, with emotional content being noted
in the research nurses’ field notes that captured the
194

 contextual and nonverbal features of the interview.
Data
integrity
between
the
audio files
and
the
verbatim transcripts was assured by having both the
transcriptionist and a research team member indepen-
dently verify transcripts line-by-line. The research pro-
tocol was approved by the University of Calgary
Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board.
Using Strauss and Corbin’s approach to grounded
theory, data analysis proceeded through three stages
of coding.30 The first stage of coding, open coding,
involved the analysis team (S.S., S.McCl., S.R.B.,
T.H.) independently coding transcripts line-by-line us-
ing the constant comparative technique, whereby sub-
sequent codes are compared with previous codes both
within and across interviews to discover, name, and
categorize phenomena.30 Investigators met through
videoconference each month to review transcripts,
comparing and contrasting individual codes until
consensus was reached. The second stage of coding,
axial coding, involved assigning codes to themes and
categories by way of a coding schema illustrating the
context in which the category occurs, the purpose it
serves, the intervening constructs influencing the cate-
gory, and the consequences of those categories. The
coding schema was developed after analyzing the first
10 transcripts during a three-day face-to-face meeting.
During this meeting, the analysis team grouped codes
and categories from each transcript under initial con-
cepts, identifying the interview in which the code
occurred and the code’s frequency across transcripts.
The coding schema was used as a guide in subsequent
interviews, with investigators independently recording
the occurrence of a code within the coding schema,
recording additional codes in the transcript margins,
and informing and incorporating the tentative core
variable and the modified coding schema through a
process of consensus. The third stage of analysis, selec-
tive coding, occurred after all transcripts had been
analyzed over the course of a three-day face-to-face
meeting and involved the verification of the core vari-
able and the development of the empirical model.
Results
The key elements of compassion emerging from the
data generated seven categories, each containing
several distinct themes and subthemes (Fig. 1). In
addition
to
these
core
components
(categories,
themes and sub-themes), the relationship between
the key categories and clinical processes are conceptu-
alized within an empirical model of compassionate
practice (Fig. 2). The verbatim quotes here serve as ex-
emplars of their associated categories and themes and
were selected based on their clarity and consistency in
illustrating the collective views and diversity of the
sample.
The core variable of compassion that emerged from
the data, which traversed each component of the con-
ceptual model, was a ‘‘virtuous response to suffering.’’
The identification and verification of the core variable
resulted in the following definition of compassiond‘‘a
virtuous response that seeks to address the suffering
and needs of a person through relational understand-
ing and action.’’
Virtues
Study participants indicated that compassion was
predicated on health care provider virtues, indepen-
dent of patient behavior, relatedness, or deservedness.
Virtues were described as ‘‘good or noble qualities
embodied in the character of the health care pro-
vider.’’ Specifically, patients felt compassion stemmed

Compassion in Health Care: An Empirical Model
 from virtues of genuineness, love, honesty, openness,
care, authenticity, understanding, tolerance, kindness,
and acceptance. Patients felt that the dispositional na-
ture of virtues was experienced largely through their
health care providers’ presence, with disingenuous
or overly prescriptive approaches being easily distin-
guishable from their virtue-based counterpart. Virtues
functioned as antecedents to health care provider
compassion, whereas suffering was the corresponding
patient antecedent in the compassion equationdwith
the former being explicitly identified as a core cate-
gory of compassion while the latter functioned implic-
itly in the subtext of patient narratives. In identifying
virtues as the internal motivator for compassion,
several patients shared experiences where compassion
was lacking, attributing these clinical encounters to
either the absence of health care provider virtues or
to competing vocational motivators that usurped
health care provider virtues.
I think possibly that’s one of the reasons why maybe
they’ve gotten into the healthcare industry . you
still have to have that inner fire to sort of motivate
you to want to do that . if you just learn the out-
ward actions it’ll come across as being a sort of fa-
c
¸ade and really not as meaningful (Patient 51).
It is okay to become a professional and make a
reasonable, genuine decent living but, at the same
time, use those noble qualities to serve people
with compassion (Patient 20).
It’s the acceptance of allowing the person to be
their worse (Patient 7).
Relational Space
The interpersonal nature of compassion engen-
dered and was subsequently delivered within a rela-
tional space, which was defined as ‘‘the context and
content of a compassionate encounter where the per-
son suffering is aware of and is engaged by, the virtues
of the health care provider.’’ The intent and depth of
the health care provider-patient relationship was a
defining feature of compassion, extending beyond
simply acknowledging and understanding the needs
of the patient to relating to them as a fellow human
being and actively engaging their suffering. The cate-
gory of relational space comprised two
themes.
The theme of ‘‘patient awareness’’ describes the extent
to which patients intuitively knew or initially sensed
health care provider capacity for compassion. The sec-
ond theme, ‘‘engaged caregiving,’’ refers to tangible
indicators of health care provider compassion in the
clinical encounter that established and continued to
define the health care provider-patient relationship
over time. Although categories of ‘‘virtuous response,
seeking to understand, relational communicating,
and attending to needs’’ were distinct categories
(Fig. 1), they were subsumed in the broader category
of relational space (Fig. 2) and describe, in greater
detail, the specific attitudes, behaviors and actions
related to compassion that occurred there.
Theme: Patient Awareness.
I would have to say I know it intuitively. You feel it
coming off them (Patient 47).
I can feel people’s compassion. Somebody can
come by and I do not even know or see or nothing
and I can tell that they’re giving me compassion
(Patient 27).
Theme: Engaged Caregiving.
They stop and listen, they establish a relationship
and get to know who you are, they get to know me
as a person and vice versa (Patient 10).
You could feel she was being compassionate . just by
their body language, the way they’re talking to you,
when they come in you can just tell by the feeling
you get off them, their reactions (Patient 33).

Interview Guiding Questions
1. What are the things that you have found to be important to your well-being during your illness? Particularly as it relates to the care you
have received?
2. In terms of your own illness experience, what does compassion mean to you?
3. Can you give me an example of when you experienced care that was compassionate?
4. How do you know when a healthcare professional is being compassionate?
5. Since you have had cancer, has compassionate care always been helpful? Have been there times when health providers’ efforts to be
compassionate missed the mark?
6. What advice would you give health care providers on being compassionate? [Do you think we can train people to be compassionate?
If so, how]?
7. We have talked about compassion, another word that might be related to compassion is sympathy. In your experience are compassion and
sympathy related? [Tell me how they are the same or different].
8. We have talked about compassion and sympathy, another word that might be related to compassion is empathy. In your experience are
compassion and empathy related? [Tell me how they are the same or different].
9. How does what you have told me about compassion relate to your experience of spirituality?
10. Is there anything that that we have not talked about day that we have missed or you were hoping to talk about?

 Virtuous Response
Virtuous response, ‘‘the enactment of a virtue toward
a person in suffering,’’ emerged as both a distinct cate-
gory and an overarching principle of care that func-
tioned as a catalyst to the three core categories of
compassionate caregiving: ‘‘seeking to understand,
relational communicating, and attending to needs’’
(Fig. 2). The category of virtuous response contained
three broad themes within it: knowing the person, per-
son as priority, and beneficence. Health care providers’
latent virtues were considered insufficient for a clinical
encounter to be deemed compassionate, as virtues
needed to generate an externalized response to patient
suffering within the relational space. The first theme
within the category of virtuous response, ‘‘knowing
the person,’’ refers to the extent to which health care
providers approached their patients as persons and
viewed their health issues and suffering from this van-
tage point. The theme ‘‘person as priority’’ involved
health care providers’ ability to prioritize patient needs,
setting aside their own assumptions and health care sys-
tem priorities in the process. ‘‘Beneficence’’ refers to
health care providers desiring the best for the patient,
informing the three more targeted core categories of

Compassion in Health Care: An Empirical Model
 compassionate caregiving: seeking to understand, rela-
tional communicating, and attending to needs.
Theme: Knowing the Person.
Compassion is caring enough to see what you’re
going through, let me see how I can make this expe-
rience better for you (Patient 53).
Take the time to reflect back and think about what
the patient’s going through (Patient 4).
Theme: Person as Priority.
They’re [healthcare providers] going all according
to the law, the legalities of the system but the patient
might have needs that have to override that (Patient
11).
Compassion is not about you, its about the other
person (Patient 23).
Theme: Beneficence.
Not only do they mean well, they also do well (Pa-
tient 40).
Compassion is just a general feeling on a person’s
behalf
that
he
wants
only
good
.
he
feels
only good things should happen for this person
(Patient 9).
Seeking to Understand
Seeking to understand was defined as ‘‘the extent to
which health care providers attempt to understand the
patient as a person and to understand the person’s
unique needs to optimize the effect of compassion.’’
Seeking to understand extended health care pro-
viders’ initial desire to know and prioritize the patient
as a person by pursuing a deeper understanding of the
person and their unique illness experiencedto under-
stand the person behind the disease. Being seen as a
disease, rather than a person living with a disease,
was experienced subtlety and infrequently. However,
when this did occur it often had an enduring and
detrimental effect on the caregiving relationship and
participants’ sense of well-being. The necessity of at-
tempting to understand a person’s needs and then
tailoring care accordingly was identified by most pa-
tients as a fundamental feature of compassion.
Theme: Seeking to Understand the Person.
We’ve got to give space to people to be human, so
just like I want to be treated human, I want to treat
them humanly too, with compassion (Patient 7).
The day I [a male patient] was diagnosed I was seen
by a person from the counseling team . I told her
that I need to get my kids to talk to someone and
she said ‘‘Well I’m busy doing programming next
week and if you want to talk to someone sooner,
I’ll get someone from one of the other cancer
groups to contact you.’’ And I said ‘‘What do you
mean other cancer groups?’’ and she said ‘‘Well we
divide our counseling up by the kind of cancer
you have’’ . It seems a little odd to me that it is
based on the kind of cancer I have because it’s
not the kind of cancer that’s concerning me, it’s
Fig. 2. Compassion model: compassion in clinical practice.
198

Sinclair et al.
 the fact that cancer is killing me. When I was finally
contacted I said ‘‘So which cancer group are your
from?’’ and she said ‘‘I’m from the breast and
ovarian cancer group.’’ What I wanted to say was
‘‘You know what, when my ovaries need cancer
counseling, I’ll give you a call’’ (Patient 53).
Theme: Seeking to Understand the Person’s Needs.
They’ve invested in me, emotionally, to understand
me and my needs (Patient 53).
When someone is trying to be helpful on their
terms, that’s just not going to cut it . to be compas-
sionate is to listen to see what the other person
needs (Patient 17).
Relational Communicating
The category of relational communicating was a
prominent element of compassion identified by pa-
tients consisting of ‘‘verbal and nonverbal displays of
compassion conveyed through health care provider
demeanor, affect, behavior, and engagement with the
person in suffering.’’ A defining characteristic of rela-
tional communicating was that it is mediated through
verbal and nonverbal communication, affecting the
health care provider-patient relationship and patient
well-being in the process. Participants identified four
specific
themes
and
associated
subthemes
that
conveyed compassion within clinical communication:
demeanor (‘‘being’’), affect (‘‘feeling for’’), behavior
(‘‘doing for’’), and engagement (‘‘being with’’).
Theme: Demeanor.
‘‘Demeanor’’ was the expression of
health care provider disposition, conveyed by way of
nonverbal communication such as body language, eye
contact, tone of voice, posturing, and countenanced
functioning as the initial indicators of compassion-
based communication. Demeanor was closely related
to the theme of ‘‘patient awareness’’ within the category
of ‘‘relational space’’ but differed in being more sensory-
based, developed, and contextual to clinical communi-
cation in comparison with the extrasensory character
of patient awareness.
You can hear it in their voice and you can see it in
their tone. They actually care how you are feeling
(Patient 45).
Their demeanor, their body language, how they
speak to you, their tone of voice, the eye contact
that they make with you. I think those are the pri-
mary indicators (Patient 51).
Something in their eyes, in their face. Something in
the way they act toward you. All of these things enter
in the picture (Patient 18).
Theme: Affect.
‘‘Affect’’ described the extent to which
health care providers could actively resonate with their
patients’ emotions and the influence that their virtues
had in this process. In relation to compassion, affect
was
characterized
by
vulnerability
and
action,
requiring health care providers to enter the relational
space and position themselves in the ‘‘patient’s shoes’’
as clinical information was being shared.
They [patient’s health care team] are all good but
there are just some exceptional ones. That’s the
compassion part. Just really loving their patients
and I guess putting themselves out there you
know, it could be their brother or their sister. So
just I guess putting themselves, you know to see
what it could be like if it was me or one of my family
(Patient 21).
Compassion involves feeling with, someone trying
to put themselves in your shoes first, feeling for
you not just as an outsider, by trying to understand
and accordingly act (Patient 26).
Theme: Behaviors.
‘‘Behaviors’’ associated with rela-
tional communicating refer to interpersonal skills
used
in
clinical
communication
that
conveyed
compassion. Compassion-related behaviors varied in
expression; however, each shared an important com-
monality that distinguished them from generalized
caringdthey required health care providers to give
not only of themselves as a professional but as a per-
son. The primary behaviors associated with relational
communicating were described by patients as showing
respect, physical displays of caring, and listening and
supportive words.
There’s the ones that really want to help and then
there’s the ones that will put the gloves on just to
touch me and you know, that can be offensive, it
takes away from compassion as soon as they walk
in, it’s the gloves . . . I feel like I am contagious (Pa-
tient 11).
Compassion means to me someone listening. Really
listening and hearing what I am saying rather than
what they think I am saying. It’s important that
you hear what I’m saying so that we can address
this correctly for me (Patient 32).
Theme: Engagement.
‘‘Engagement’’ involved the de-
gree to which patients felt that health care providers
Vol. 51 No. 2 February 2016
199
Compassion in Health Care: An Empirical Model
 were actively present in the clinical encounter. The
first facet of engagement was attentiveness, evident
through nonverbal (e.g., sitting versus standing at
the patient’s bedside) and temporal indicators (e.g.,
communicating regularly with patients about their
needs or communicating potential health issues to
other members of the patient’s care team). Acknowl-
edgment, the second essential facet of engagement,
involved recognizing the personal impact of suffering,
mirroring this back to the patient, and integrating this
information into subsequent interactions. The final
facet of engagement that participants identified was
dialogue, consisting of health care providers commu-
nicating clinical information accurately and sensi-
tively, including the effective use of silence and
allowing
patients
to
participate
in
the
clinical
conversation.
They’re are actually there, you can see that they’re
there in mind and body, that they’re not off some-
where else (Patient 25).
Just sitting there is all the compassion that they can
give, because you know they cannot do anything for
the person, but they can be there (Patient 15).
Attending to Needs
Attending to needs refers to ‘‘a timely and attuned
desire to actively engage in and address a person’s
multifactorial suffering’’dthe quintessential category
and outcome of compassion. Although other cate-
gories
and
themes
are
essential
components
of
compassion, they culminated into one singular aimd
to actively and tangibly address the needs of a person
in suffering. Attending to needs had three interrelated
themes:
‘‘compassion-related
needs,
timely,
and
action.’’
Theme:
Compassion-Related
Needs.
‘‘Compassion-
related needs’’ refer to the dimensions of suffering
that participants felt compassion ameliorated: phys-
ical, emotional, spiritual, familial, and financial. Par-
ticipants
identified
compassionate
health
care
providers as those who, regardless of their scope of
practice, were willing to actively attend to a patient’s
immediate needs.
Doctors who are more compassionate that way, they
care about your whole being and not just about the
cancer you are living with. It’s just some doctors are
so busy and entrenched in their specialty that they
became maybe a bit hardened (Patient 26).
I started crying [at diagnosis] and the nurse came
and sat beside me and put her arms around me
and held me and I cried enough to soak her uni-
form (Patient 15).
Theme: Timely.
A second distinguishing characteristic
of compassion in relation to attending to needs was
addressing suffering in a ‘‘timely’’ manner. A dual un-
derstanding of time emerged from the data, referring
to both the desire of health care providers to address
suffering in a responsive manner and at an opportune
moment. The responsive dimension of time was
frequently referenced to acute suffering (e.g., a pain
crisis), whereas exemplars related to the opportune
aspect of time were associated with situations where
health care providers sought to sensitively address pro-
tracted suffering. These included addressing existen-
tial distress or sharing prognostic information at a
time when patients were most receptive and supported
to receive it (e.g., such as breaking bad news when
family was present or titrating prognostic information
over time).
Don’t numb them [patients] over the head with the
bald truth, be compassionate about the way you talk
to them . the professionals here have been very
compassionate in terms of how they’re relaying
news to me (Patient 6).
I really feel the most important thing is for peo-
ple to try to understand that with the pain we
have, how bad it can be. And that you know
when we when we’re in pain, just to understand
that if we ask for a breakthrough in medication
in the hospital and it takes 45 minutes to get
it, that’s very, very, painful, that’s not compas-
sionate (Patient 25).
Theme:
Action.
The
prevalence
of
‘‘action’’
throughout the various components of compassion
was
particularly
pronounced
in
the
category
of
attending to needs. Action referred to the initiation
and engagement of a dynamic and tangible process
aimed at alleviating suffering. Although participants
acknowledged action as a general attribute of care-
giving, it was the quintessential feature of compassion.
In particular, participants identified supererogatory
acts, whereby health care providers went ‘‘beyond
the call of duty’’ or ‘‘going the extra mile,’’ as exem-
plars of compassionate action.
Compassion is more action. (Patient 47).
They put themselves out there, they’re doing the
extra little bit that you do not normally get .
They’re
going
above
and
beyond
and
doing
other things that they’ve been taught, [things
they] do not necessarily have to do because it’s
not their job but they’re doing it anyways (Pa-
tient 9).
The girls [nurses] come in [and say] ‘‘would you
like a warm blanket’’? They know you are going to

 be uncovered. Like taking that extra step. Taking
that extra step is compassion (Patient 50).
Patient-Reported Outcomes
The impact of compassion on patients who were
suffering was profound. Patient-reported outcomes re-
fers to ‘‘the effect of compassion on suffering, patient
well-being, and care.’’ Patients did not regard compas-
sion as a panacea to suffering; rather, compassion had
an ameliorating affect on suffering, while concurrently
protecting patient well-being. Although some patients
felt that compassion directly improved health out-
comes, most felt it primarily enhanced their well-
being and the quality of their relationship with their
health care providers. In describing the impact of
compassion, a number of patients noted negative out-
comes resulting from the absence of compassion.
These experiences had an equally enduring, albeit
detrimental, effect on their well-being and the care-
giving relationship, often exacerbating suffering in
the process.
There was absolutely zero compassion that night
[when the emergency room physician communicated
the diagnosis] . I would tell her the way you handled
this situation,ifI wouldhavebeenweak ofmindin any
stretch of the imagination, I would not have been sur-
prised and maybe I would have tried to commit sui-
cide, that’s where it pushed me (Patient 5).
If you’re not receiving compassionate care, you get
frustrated,
your
spirit
drops.
I
become
over-
whelmed, I become completely frustrated by the sit-
uation to the point where little things that should
be relatively manageable become unmanageable,
so I think it has a huge impact on the recipient (Pa-
tient 10).
It’s a very, very strong feeling, it’s a solidifying build-
ing quality that makes a person feel whole, it make
them feel valued and loved, that brings dignity .
it’s such a powerful thing (Patient 7).
Discussion
Despite being espoused as a hallmark of quality
care,1e4,14 a health care priority,1,2,9,15,16 and emerging
research that suggests it has a positive effect on patients’
health,9,13,15 an evidence-based framework on the na-
ture and key domains of compassion in health care
remains nascent. This study addresses this theory-
practice gap and a significant conceptual issue: the
lack of patient perspectives of compassion. Although
theoretical
conceptualizations
and
initial
studies
directly involving patients are beginning to emerge,28,33
they largely use a priori definitions of compassion
conceptualized by scholars, describing the responder’s
perspective, often with disregard to the recipients per-
spectivedin this case, patients.21,24 We could locate
only one exploratory study investigating patients’ per-
ceptions of compassionate nursing, which inquired
about the meaning of compassionate nursing care
from patients directly.28 The present study addresses
these fundamental conceptual and methodologic is-
sues by generating the first clinically informed empir-
ical model of compassion that defines and codifies the
core elements of compassion from the perspective of
patients at the end of life. The various components of
compassion provide an empirical foundation for the
development of a compassion inventory to measure pa-
tients’ experiences of compassion. In addition to its
clinical utility, a measure would provide the means to
conduct future randomized controlled trials and to
evaluate education interventions.
Another notable and related finding of this study
was the identification of health care provider virtues
as antecedents to compassion, affirming theory within
the field of virtue ethics,26 which may distinguish
compassion from related constructs of empathy and
sympathy. Study participants identified compassion
primarily as a disposition, requiring action, consti-
tuting another important demarcation from empathy,
which has been identified as an attitude, emotion, or
state that is situational and contingent on health
care providers’ ability to ‘‘feel for’’ the patient, the de-
gree to which they can personally relate to the patient,
and the perceived deservedness of suffering.34e36 The
distinguishing virtue-based antecedents and action-
based outcomes of compassion affirm studies within
the social neuroscience investigating empathic brain
responses.35 The authors concluded that empathy is
an affective state that is isomorphic with the affective
state of an ‘‘other,’’ that is not necessarily linked with
prosocial motivation or behavior, which was postulated
to be a defining feature of compassion.35
Numerous studies have identified the central role of
nonverbal communication in effective bedside clinical
communication within health care delivery, including
listening, presence, human relatedness, and crea-
tivity.10,12,13,25,32,37,38 These often subtle, yet powerful el-
ements of human communication have been found to
be teachable skills that positively impact patient-
trainee interactions.39 Translating ‘‘clinical communica-
tion skills’’ into ‘‘skilled clinical communication,’’
however, remains a challenge as clinicians afford mini-
mal time to active listening,20,38 despite evidence indi-
cating
that
family
satisfaction
with
physician
communication is significantly predicted by the propor-
tion of time that physicians listen.13 The present study
provides some guidance as compassionate clinical
communication involves not only emotional resonance

Compassion in Health Care: An Empirical Model
 on the part of the health care provider but a willingness
to actively ‘‘suffer with’’7 patients coupled with action
aimed at amelioration.8 As such, compassion implores
vulnerability on the part of health care providers to
engage and relate to patient suffering from a place of
shared humanity.
Although the plausibility of compassion training is
contested,1,36,40 recent research has demonstrated
that aptitude in these areas can and needs to be culti-
vated within health care education.41 This study adds
to this debate, suggesting that although compassion
can be cultivated, it may in part be contingent on
the innate human qualities that learners possess at
baseline. Therefore, it may be beneficial to evaluate
students’ compassion aptitude at an early stage to
determine teachability and to develop individualized
learning plans to enhance these inherent qualities
over time or at the very least buffer against the erosion
of these qualities over the course of health care
training.36,41 Further research is needed, including in-
terventional studies, to explore these pedagogical is-
sues and their impact on clinical communication
scores3,11,15 and patient experience,10,18,19 including
longitudinal studies measuring the retention and ef-
fect of training over time.
Although this study addresses many fundamental
questions on the nature of compassion within clinical
practice, it raises other questions, requiring further
research. Although patients’ perspectives are founda-
tional to an empirical understanding of compassion,26
the
inherently
relational
nature
of
compassion
requires the inclusion of health care provider perspec-
tives to validate and further inform the compassion
model (Fig. 2). Extending the scope of inquiry to
health care providers could help identify: health care
provider outcomes within the compassion model;
patient facilitators, barriers indicators, and outcomes;
contextual variants of compassion, such as personality,
health
care
discipline,
and
specialty;
and
the
relationship between virtues and compassion from
the perspective of the individuals who possess these
qualities.
There are several limitations to be disclosed that
affect the generalizability of our findings. The sample
comprised cancer inpatients being cared for by an
interdisciplinary palliative care team. Their perspec-
tives may not be indicative of noncancer populations
or patients at other points along the disease trajectory.
Despite using an open-ended interview guide allowing
participants to reflect on their experience of compas-
sion throughout their illness, the retrospective nature
of these questions and the palliative care team’s aware-
ness of the study may have caused recall bias or shaped
participant responses. A further limitation of this
study, and the literature in general, is the lack of
clinical research on the nature of suffering in a health
care context42dan important antecedent and the un-
derlying
condition
that
compassion
aims
to
ameliorate.
The findings suggest that compassion, as experi-
enced by patients, is both situational and dispositio-
naldrequiring health care providers to invoke their
personhood along with their clinical proficiencies to
have an optimal effect in alleviating patient suffering.
Although compassion is seemingly intuitive, a gap per-
sists between what patients consider a pillar of quality
care and health care providers’ ability to deliver this
essential component of care from an evidence-based
perspective. Although the compassion model codifies
the key elements of compassion, providing a founda-
tion for clinical practice and research, the nature
and diversity of compassion will be as unique and
particular as the players who enter the clinical
encounter.
