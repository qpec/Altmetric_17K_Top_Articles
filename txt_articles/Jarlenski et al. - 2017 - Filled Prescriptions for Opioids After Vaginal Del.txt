Abstract
Objective—To estimate the prevalence of filled opioid prescriptions after vaginal delivery.
Methods—We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 164,720 Medicaid-enrolled women in 
Pennsylvania who delivered a live born infant vaginally from 2008 to 2013, excluding women who 
used opioids during pregnancy or who had an opioid use disorder. We assessed overall filled 
prescriptions, as well as filled prescriptions in the presence or absence of the following pain-
inducing conditions: bilateral tubal ligation, perineal laceration, or episiotomy. Outcomes included 
a binary measure of whether a woman had any opioid prescription fill ≤5 days after delivery and, 
among those women, a second opioid prescription fill 6–60 days after delivery. Among women 
with no coded pain-inducing conditions at delivery, we used multivariable logistic regression, with 
standard errors clustered to account for within-hospital correlation, to assess the association 
between patient characteristics and odds of a filled opioid prescription.
Results—Twelve percent of women (n=18,131) filled an outpatient opioid prescription ≤5 days 
after vaginal delivery; among those women, 14% (n=2,592, or 1.6% of the total) filled a second 
opioid prescription 6–60 days after delivery. Of the former, 5,110 (28.2%) had one or more pain-
inducing conditions. Predictors of filled opioid prescriptions with no observed pain-inducing 
condition at delivery included tobacco use (AOR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.2–1.4) and mental health 
condition (AOR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.2,1.4). Having a diagnosis of substance use disorder other than 
opioid use disorder was not associated with filling an opioid prescription ≤5 days after delivery,

INTRODUCTION
An average of 39% of Medicaid-enrolled women of reproductive age fill an outpatient 
prescription for opioid pain relievers each year.1 In the last decade, overdose deaths from 
opioid pain relievers have increased fivefold among U.S. women.2 These concerning trends 
along with the quadrupling of the sales of opioid pain relievers between 1999 and 2010 have 
called into question the appropriateness of opioid prescribing for a host of acute and chronic 
conditions.3 Outpatient prescription opioid use for acute pain may be a potential pathway to 
long-term use or opioid use disorders.4
While maternity care is the most common reason for hospitalization in the United States, 
little is known about opioid prescribing practices after obstetric delivery. Prior research 
examined the prevalence of opioid prescribing after cesarean delivery in privately insured 
women, with the finding that about 1 in 300 women became persistent users of opioids after 
filling an initial opioid prescription after cesarean delivery.6
The prevalence and patterns of opioid prescribing after vaginal delivery have been little 
investigated. Our objectives were therefore to determine the prevalence of filled opioid 
prescriptions and to identify demographic and clinical predictors of filled outpatient opioid 
prescriptions after vaginal delivery among a large cohort of Medicaid-enrolled women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cohort study and obtained administrative health care claims 
data from the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services Medicaid program. The data 
included enrollment files, as well as inpatient, professional, and pharmacy claims and 
encounters for all Medicaid enrollees (including those in Medicaid managed care plans and 
in traditional fee-for-service coverage) from January 1, 2008–December 31, 2013. 
Enrollment files contain information about patient demographic characteristics; inpatient 
and professional files contain information about clinical characteristics and health care 
utilization during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum. Pharmacy records contain 
information about all filled outpatient prescriptions, including the National Drug Code 
(NDC), the date the prescription was filled, and the duration of the prescription.
We used an algorithm validated by the National Committee for Quality Assurance to identify 
women who had an inpatient delivery and a live birth (Figure 1).7 Using this method, we

 identified the date of delivery and considered the 280 days prior to the date of delivery to 
approximate the period of pregnancy. In order to measure diagnoses and health care 
utilization that occurred throughout pregnancy, we included women with vaginal deliveries 
with live births from Oct. 1, 2008 to Dec. 31, 2013. We used ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 
(66971, 64981, 64982) and surgical procedure codes (74.0, 74.1, 74.2, 74.4, 74.99) to 
identify and exclude women who had a cesarean delivery. Because we were interested in 
studying filled prescriptions for opioids that were related only to pain control after a 
delivery, we used pharmacy files to identify and exclude women who filled any opioid 
prescription, including opioid pain relievers, buprenorphine, or methadone, during the 280 
days before delivery. We excluded women who were diagnosed with opioid use disorder 
during pregnancy, as well as a small number of women who had >1 outpatient opioid 
prescription fill within 5 days after delivery because this prescription pattern might indicate 
an unusually high level of pain or delivery complication or an opioid use disorder that was 
not diagnosed; excluding such cases ensures our study sample is focused on typical vaginal 
deliveries. Because opioids might be prescribed when NSAIDS are contraindicated, we 
additionally excluded women with renal disease, thrombocytopenia, and other bleeding 
disorders. Our final study sample included 164,720 women. The study was determined to be 
exempt by the University of Pittsburgh Human Research Protection Office.
Our primary outcome was the prevalence of a filled outpatient prescription for any opioid 
within 5 days after delivery, including the quantity of opioid filled. Our secondary outcome 
was the presence of a second filled opioid prescription between 6–60 days after vaginal 
delivery, including the quantity of opioid filled. We used NDCs to identify opioid 
prescriptions that are used for pain management (i.e., excluding drugs used for medication 
assisted treatment for opioid use disorder or intravenous drugs).
We identified women who had a diagnosis that would likely be associated with an increased 
level of pain after delivery, relative to deliveries without such diagnoses. These diagnoses 
included bilateral tubal ligation (ICD-9-CM code V25.2); third degree laceration or anal 
sphincter tear (ICD-9-CM codes 664.2 or 664.6); fourth degree laceration (ICD-9-CM codes 
664.3); or episiotomy (ICD-9-CM procedure codes 73.6, 72.1, 72.2–7). We assessed first 
degree laceration (ICD-9-CM codes 664.0); second degree laceration (ICD-9-CM codes 
664.1); or other trauma, including periurethral trauma, laceration of the cervix, and high 
vaginal laceration (ICD-9-CM codes 664.8, 664.3, 665.4) but note that the prevalence of 
opioid prescriptions did not differ by these diagnoses (data not shown; available from 
authors upon request).
Other measures included categorical measures of patient age (15–19, 20–34, or ≥35 years); 
patient race (black, white, Asian, or other) and Hispanic ethnicity; whether women had a 
prior delivery during the study time period (a proxy measure for parity); and geographic 
region of residence at Medicaid enrollment. We used Medicaid geographic regions because 
they correspond to women’s access to certain Medicaid managed care organizations and 
their health care provider networks. We were particularly interested in whether other types 
of addiction in pregnancy (tobacco use or non-opioid substance use disorder) or mental 
health conditions might be predictive of filling opioid prescriptions after delivery.8 These 
conditions were based on diagnosis codes that occurred during pregnancy or delivery,

 including non-opioid substance use disorder; tobacco use; or mental health conditions 
including major depressive disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.
We calculated descriptive characteristics of our study population, stratified by whether or not 
women filled any outpatient prescription for an opioid within 5 days after vaginal delivery, 
or within 6–60 days after vaginal delivery. Among women who filled an opioid prescription, 
we assessed the distribution of days’ supply of opioid prescriptions, among women with and 
without observed pain-inducing conditions at delivery. Among women who filled an opioid 
prescription after delivery but had no observed pain-inducing conditions at delivery, we 
employed multivariable logistic regression to assess which factors were associated with any 
filled prescription within 5 days after delivery; and among women with an initial filled 
prescription, which factors were associated with a subsequent filled opioid prescription 
within 6–60 days after delivery. Both regression models controlled for demographic 
characteristics, as well as clinical characteristics that were associated with outcomes in 
bivariate analyses. Standard errors were clustered to account for correlation within hospitals 
where deliveries occurred.
RESULTS
The age distribution among women with and without outpatient filled opioid prescriptions 
after vaginal delivery was similar; women with filled opioid prescriptions were more likely 
to be white and reside in the Southwest region of the state relative to those without opioid 
prescription fills (Table 1). Approximately 12% (n=18,131) of women with a vaginal 
delivery filled an outpatient opioid prescription within 5 days after delivery, of which 28.2% 
had any pain inducing condition after delivery. Among women who filled an initial opioid 
prescription, 14.3% (n=2,592, or 1.6% of the total) filled a second opioid prescription 6–60 
days after delivery, of which 26.2% had any pain inducing condition after delivery. Relative 
to women who did not fill an opiod prescription, women who filled an initial opioid 
prescription within 5 days after delivery were more likely to have undergone tubal ligation 
(12.0% vs. 1.4%), sustained a third or fourth degree laceration (3.1% vs. 1.5% and 1% vs. 
0.3%, respectively), or to have undergone episiotomy (14.1% vs. 7.6%). In contrast, the 
prevalence of pain-inducing conditions at delivery did not differ substantially between 
women who did or did not fill a second opioid prescription 6–60 days after vaginal delivery 
(Table 2). The prevalence of tubal ligation, laceration, and episiotomy was similar between 
women who did or did not fill a second opioid prescription.
Among women with vaginal deliveries and who filled a prescription for opioids within 5 
days after delivery, the modal days’ supply of opioid prescription was 3 days (Figure 2). The 
distribution of days’ supply was nearly identical for women with (Figure 2, Panel A) and 
without (Figure 2, Panel B) tubal ligation, third or fourth degree laceration, or episiotomy. 
Although most women received between 3 and 7 days’ supply, a small proportion of women 
with vaginal deliveries received up to 30 days’ supply. Most filled prescription were 
combinations of acetaminophen and oxycodone (53.5%), codeine (20.5%), and hydrocodone 
(19.6%) (Table 3).

 Among women who had no tubal ligation, severe perineal laceration, or episiotomy, white 
race, residing in the Southwest part of the state, tobacco use, and mental health conditions 
were significantly associated with filling an outpatient opioid prescription within 5 days 
after vaginal delivery (Table 4). A diagnosis of tobacco use in pregnancy was associated 
with a small increase in the odds of filling a prescription within 5 days after delivery (AOR: 
1.3, 95% CI 1.2–1.4), as well as filling a second opioid prescription 6–60 days after delivery 
(AOR: 1.4, 95% CI 1.3–1.6), relative to no tobacco use. Having a diagnosis of substance use 
disorder other than opioid use disorder was not associated with filling an opioid prescription 
within 5 days after delivery, but was associated with filling a second opioid prescription 6–
60 days after delivery (AOR: 1.4; 95% CI 1.2–1.6) conditional on filling a first prescription. 
A diagnosis of a mental health condition, relative to not having such a diagnosis, was 
associated with slightly increased odds of filling an opioid prescription within 5 days after 
delivery (AOR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.2,1.4), as well as filling a second opioid prescription 6–60 
days after delivery (AOR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.1,1.5).
DISCUSSION
Among Medicaid-enrolled women, slightly more than one in 10 women with a vaginal 
delivery and no opioid use during pregnancy filled an outpatient prescription for an opioid 
after delivery. Importantly, the majority of women who filled an outpatient opioid 
prescription within 5 days after vaginal delivery had no tubal ligation, severe perineal 
laceration, or episiotomy coded in in our administrative database. Tobacco use was 
associated with a small increase in the odds of filling outpatient opioid prescriptions after 
vaginal delivery, as were mental health conditions. The modal days’ supply of filled opioid 
prescriptions was 3 days, and the distribution of days’ supply was nearly identical for 
women with and without documented pain-inducing conditions at delivery. A small 
proportion of women filled opioid prescriptions with days’ supply ranging from 7 to 30 
days.
Medicaid-enrolled patients have an increased risk of potentially inappropriate use or 
prescribing of opioids relative to privately insured patients.9 Approximately one-third of all 
Medicaid-enrolled women had an outpatient opioid prescription in the prior year.1 Our 
results suggest that many opioid prescriptions after vaginal delivery in Medicaid are 
unexplained by clinical complications or observed pain-inducing conditions that occur 
during the delivery hospitalization.
There are several possible explanations for this finding. First, health care providers may be 
motivated to prescribe opioids for any level of pain after vaginal deliveries after efforts to 
make pain a “fifth vital sign” and to include pain management as part of patient satisfaction 
measures.10. Recently, the American Medical Association recommended that pain not be 
considered a vital sign and that patient satisfaction scores not include pain management 
questions.11 Second, some share of women who have vaginal deliveries may be requesting 
additional pain medication and receiving prescriptions for opioids. Third, health care 
provider preferences for different pain management strategies may explain opioid 
prescribing patterns. Our analyses accounted for correlation at the hospital level, but our data 
did not allow a detailed description of variation of the clinician level. Future work, including

 qualitative interviews or surveys, is warranted to assess the reasons that some obstetric 
health care providers may prescribe opioids after vaginal delivery.
These findings build on prior research suggesting that Medicaid-enrolled women, who have 
low incomes and often face adverse social circumstances, may have greater rates of opioid 
prescription fills compared to privately insured women.12, 13 Our finding that women with 
tobacco use or mental health disorders have a slightly greater odds of filling opioid 
prescriptions after vaginal delivery are consistent with a prior study of opioid use after 
cesarean delivery in Massachusetts.6
Currently, there are no national guidelines regarding outpatient opioid pain relievers for pain 
management after vaginal delivery. Notably, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania recently 
published a report outlining opioid prescribing guidelines for obstetric care. To our 
knowledge, these are the first state-issued opioid prescribing guidelines to specifically 
address pain management after delivery. These guidelines include a hierarchical approach to 
managing postpartum pain after vaginal delivery: First, non-pharmacologic treatments such 
as cold, heat, sitz baths should be offered as first-line interventions for all patients with 
postpartum pain. If non-pharmacologic treatments are ineffective, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen are often sufficient analgesia for women 
with mild to moderate postpartum pain. Finally, only after pain control has not been 
achieved with non-pharmacologic interventions, NSAIDs, or both, especially in women with 
severe perineal trauma, a short-acting opioid can be used for five to seven days.5 Since these 
guidelines were published after our study time period, future research is needed to evaluate 
whether these state-level prescribing guidelines are associated with changes in opioid 
prescribing patterns after vaginal delivery.
This study has limitations. First, our data include only women enrolled in Pennsylvania 
Medicaid, so findings might not be generalizable to other populations or other states. 
However, our results are consistent with data from New York state Medicaid,12 and 
Pennsylvania is in the mid-point among all states in terms of overall opioid prescribing 
patterns.14 Second, our health care claims data do not include any measures of patient pain, 
so we are unable to account for whether differences in patient-reported pain explained filled 
outpatient opioid prescriptions after vaginal delivery. It is possible that some health 
conditions were under-coded in the data; if pain-inducing conditions at delivery were under-
coded, we would under-estimate the proportion of opioid prescriptions that were filled by 
women with documented pain-inducing conditions. Third, we were able to measure only 
filled prescriptions, and cannot determine whether a woman was prescribed an opioid but 
did not fill the prescription. This means that our results likely reflect only a proportion of 
opioid prescriptions that were written. Similarly, we are unable to measure if a woman took 
any or all of the opioids dispensed, so we are unable to draw conclusions about opioid use 
per se. Fourth, although our study excluded women with any opioid prescription during 
pregnancy, it is an imperfect measure of an opioid-naïve population because we did not 
measure pre-pregnancy opioid prescriptions. Because many women become eligible for 
Medicaid because of their pregnancy, it was not feasible for us to measure pre-pregnancy 
opioid prescription fills. Finally, our study does not measure longer-term persistent use of 
opioids after delivery. Nearly 60% of our sample gained Medicaid eligibility due to 
Jarlenski et al.

 pregnancy, and many women therefore lose Medicaid coverage 60 days post-delivery, 
making long-term follow-up challenging in our administrative data. Long-term persistent use 
is an important outcome that should be studied when data are available for years after the 
expansion of Medicaid eligibility to non-pregnant adults, when more women would be 
expected to retain longer-term coverage under Medicaid.
Outpatient opioid prescriptions were not rare after vaginal delivery in our large sample of 
Medicaid-enrolled women, and were not easily explained by any single patient demographic 
or clinical characteristic. Our findings support further investigation into persistent use of 
opioids among women who fill opioid prescriptions after vaginal delivery. Given the 
concerns about prevention and treatment of opioid use disorder in the perinatal period,15 our 
findings also suggest a need for improved clinical guidelines about pain management after 
vaginal delivery.
