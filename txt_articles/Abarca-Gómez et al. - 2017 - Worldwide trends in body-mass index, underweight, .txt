Worldwide trends in body-mass index, underweight, 
overweight, and obesity from 1975 to 2016: a pooled 
analysis of 2416 population-based measurement studies in 
128·9 million children, adolescents, and adults
NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC)*
Summary
Background Underweight, overweight, and obesity in childhood and adolescence are associated with adverse health 
consequences throughout the life-course. Our aim was to estimate worldwide trends in mean body-mass index (BMI) 
and a comprehensive set of BMI categories that cover underweight to obesity in children and adolescents, and to 
compare trends with those of adults.
Methods We pooled 2416 population-based studies with measurements of height and weight on 128·9 million 
participants aged 5 years and older, including 31·5 million aged 5–19 years. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to 
estimate trends from 1975 to 2016 in 200 countries for mean BMI and for prevalence of BMI in the following categories 
for children and adolescents aged 5–19 years: more than 2 SD below the median of the WHO growth reference for 
children and adolescents (referred to as moderate and severe underweight hereafter), 2 SD to more than 1 SD below 
the median (mild underweight), 1 SD below the median to 1 SD above the median (healthy weight), more than 1 SD to 
2 SD above the median (overweight but not obese), and more than 2 SD above the median (obesity).
Findings Regional change in age-standardised mean BMI in girls from 1975 to 2016 ranged from virtually no change 
(–0·01 kg/m² per decade; 95% credible interval –0·42 to 0·39, posterior probability [PP] of the observed decrease being 
a true decrease=0·5098) in eastern Europe to an increase of 1·00 kg/m² per decade (0·69–1·35, PP>0·9999) in central 
Latin America and an increase of 0·95 kg/m² per decade (0·64–1·25, PP>0·9999) in Polynesia and Micronesia. The 
range for boys was from a non-significant increase of 0·09 kg/m² per decade (–0·33 to 0·49, PP=0·6926) in eastern 
Europe to an increase of 0·77 kg/m² per decade (0·50–1·06, PP>0·9999) in Polynesia and Micronesia. Trends in mean 
BMI have recently flattened in northwestern Europe and the high-income English-speaking and Asia-Pacific regions 
for both sexes, southwestern Europe for boys, and central and Andean Latin America for girls. By contrast, the rise in 
BMI has accelerated in east and south Asia for both sexes, and southeast Asia for boys. Global age-standardised 
prevalence of obesity increased from 0·7% (0·4–1·2) in 1975 to 5·6% (4·8–6·5) in 2016 in girls, and from 0·9% 
(0·5–1·3) in 1975 to 7·8% (6·7–9·1) in 2016 in boys; the prevalence of moderate and severe underweight decreased 
from 9·2% (6·0–12·9) in 1975 to 8·4% (6·8–10·1) in 2016 in girls and from 14·8% (10·4–19·5) in 1975 to 12·4% 
(10·3–14·5) in 2016 in boys. Prevalence of moderate and severe underweight was highest in India, at 22·7% (16·7–29·6) 
among girls and 30·7% (23·5–38·0) among boys. Prevalence of obesity was more than 30% in girls in Nauru, the Cook 
Islands, and Palau; and boys in the Cook Islands, Nauru, Palau, Niue, and American Samoa in 2016. Prevalence of 
obesity was about 20% or more in several countries in Polynesia and Micronesia, the Middle East and north Africa, the 
Caribbean, and the USA. In 2016, 75 (44–117) million girls and 117 (70–178) million boys worldwide were moderately 
or severely underweight. In the same year, 50 (24–89) million girls and 74 (39–125) million boys worldwide were obese.
Interpretation The rising trends in children’s and adolescents’ BMI have plateaued in many high-income countries, 
albeit at high levels, but have accelerated in parts of Asia, with trends no longer correlated with those of adults.

Introduction
Being underweight, overweight, or obese during 
childhood and adolescence is associated with adverse 
health consequences throughout the life-course. Under-
weight among children and adolescents is associated with 
higher risk of infectious diseases, and for girls of 
childbearing age, is associated with adverse pregnancy 
outcomes 
including 
maternal 
mortality, 
delivery 
complications, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth 
retardation.1,2 Preventing and reversing excess weight in 
children and adolescents is also important for many 
reasons;3,4 first, weight loss and maintenance after weight 
loss are hard to achieve,5 therefore gaining excess weight 
in childhood and adolescence is likely to lead to lifelong

overweight and obesity.6 Second, being overweight in 
childhood and adolescence is associated with greater risk 
and earlier onset of chronic disorders such as type 2 
diabetes.3,4,7–9 Third, childhood and adolescent obesity 
has adverse psychosocial consequences and lowers 
educational 
attainment.3,4,10,11 
Finally, 
children 
and 
adolescents are more susceptible to food marketing than 
adults, which makes reducing children’s exposure to 
obesogenic foods necessary to protect them from harm.3,12
Although trends in children’s and adolescents’ weight 
status have been documented in individual countries, 
little comparable information exists on worldwide trends, 
and none for mean body-mass index (BMI) and 
underweight. We pooled population-based data to 
estimate trends from 1975 to 2016 in mean BMI and in 
the prevalence of a comprehensive set of BMI categories 
that cover the underweight to obese range among 
children and adolescents for all countries in the world. To 
compare the trajectory of obesity and underweight in 
children and adolescents with that of adults, we also 
generated updated estimates for adults.13
Methods
Study design
We pooled and analysed population-based studies that 
had measured height and weight in people aged 5 years 
and older to estimate trends from 1975 to 2016 in mean 
BMI and BMI categories in 200 countries and territories 
(appendix). We started our analysis from 5 years of age 
because the definitions of underweight, overweight, and 
obesity change at 5 years of age.14 Further, children enter 
school at or around this age, which is associated with a 
change in their nutrition and physical activity.15
We present data on school-aged children and 
adolescents aged 5–19 years and on adults aged 20 years 
and older. We did separate analyses for children and 
adolescents and for adults for two reasons: first, cutoffs 
used to define underweight, overweight, and obesity for 
children and adolescents are different from those for 
adults and vary by age and sex because of the natural 
growth in childhood and adolescence.16 Second, the 
trajectory of the obesity epidemic in children and 
adolescents might be different from that of adults,17 
motivating separate analyses of trends. Similarly, 
underweight in children and adolescents is typically 
targeted through school and community-based nutrition 
programmes, decoupling its trajectory from that of adults.
For children and adolescents, we analysed trends in 
mean BMI and prevalence of BMI in the following 
categories: more than 2 SD below the median of the WHO 
growth reference for children and adolescents16 (hereafter 
referred to as moderate and severe underweight), 2 SD to 
more than 1 SD below the median (mild underweight), 
1 SD below the median to 1 SD above the median (healthy 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) for articles published in 
any language between Jan 1, 1950, and July 12, 2017, using the 
search terms (“body size”[mh:noexp] OR “body 
height”[mh:noexp] OR “body weight”[mh:noexp] OR “birth 
weight”[mh:noexp] OR “overweight”[mh:noexp] OR 
“obesity”[mh] OR “thinness”[mh:noexp] OR “Waist-Hip 
Ratio”[mh:noexp] OR “Waist Circumference”[mh:noexp] OR 
“body mass index”[mh:noexp]) AND (“Humans”[mh]) AND 
(“Health Surveys”[mh] OR “Epidemiological Monitoring”[mh] 
OR “Prevalence”[mh]) NOT Comment[ptyp] NOT Case 
Reports[ptyp]. Articles were screened according to the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria described in the Appendix. 
We identified three prior global analyses of mean body-mass 
index (BMI) or prevalence of overweight and obesity among 
adults. One of these studies also estimated the prevalence of 
underweight in adults. Another study also included data on 
overweight and obesity in children and adolescents, using a 
combination of measured and self-reported height and weight, 
and analysed in the same model as adults. A few multicountry 
studies and systematic reviews have reported, quantitatively or 
qualitatively, trends in overweight and obesity in children and 
adolescents, some also reporting underweight. To our 
knowledge, there is no global analysis of mean BMI, which is a 
summary measure of population distribution, or prevalence of 
underweight among children and adolescents aged 5–19 years.
Added value of this study
This study provides a complete picture of trends in mean BMI 
and prevalence of BMI categories that cover the underweight to 
obese range among children and adolescents aged 5–19 years, 
for all countries in the world with the longest observation 
period, and compares trends with those of adults. It includes 
the first global estimates of mean BMI and underweight 
prevalence for children and adolescents. We also present trends 
in the number of children, adolescents, and adults who are 
moderately or severely underweight and obese, and thus at risk 
of adverse health outcomes.
Implications of all the available evidence
Over the past four decades, mean BMI and obesity in children 
and adolescents aged 5–19 years have increased in most 
regions and countries. Despite this rise, more children and 
adolescents are moderately or severely underweight than 
obese, with the burden of underweight increasingly 
concentrated in south Asia and central, east and west Africa. 
The rise in children’s and adolescents’ BMI has plateaued, 
albeit at high levels, in many high-income countries but has 
accelerated in parts of Asia. There is a need for bridging the 
disconnect between policies that address underweight and 
overweight in children and adolescents to coherently address 
the large remaining underweight burden while curbing and 
reversing the rise in overweight and obesity.

weight), more than 1 SD to 2 SD above the median 
(overweight but not obese), and more than 2 SD above the 
median (obesity). The cutoffs for calculating prevalence in 
these BMI categories were all age-specific and sex-specific 
and were applied to data in 1-year age bands. We used the 
WHO definitions because they include a comprehensive 
set of BMI categories ranging from moderate and severe 
underweight to obesity, defined based on symmetric 
thresholds of SDs from the reference population median. 
For adults, we analysed trends in mean BMI and prevalence 
of a comprehensive set of BMI categories as described in 
detail elsewhere and in the appendix.13 Results for children 
and adolescents are presented here; updated results 
for adults are presented in the appendix except when 
compared with children and adolescents.
Data sources
Our methods for identifying and accessing data sources, 
and our inclusion and exclusion criteria, are described in 
the appendix. In summary, we used a database of 
population-based data on cardiometabolic risk factors 
collated by the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factor 
Collaboration (NCD-RisC), a worldwide network of 
health researchers and practitioners whose aim is to 
document systematically the worldwide trends and 
variations in non-communicable disease risk factors. The 
database was collated through multiple routes for 
identifying and accessing data. We accessed publicly 
available population-based multi-country and national 
measurement surveys, as well as the WHO STEPwise 
approach to Surveillance (STEPS) surveys. We requested, 
via WHO and its regional and country offices, help with 
identification and access to population-based surveys 
from ministries of health and other national health and 
statistical agencies. We also sent requests via the World 
Heart Federation to its national partners. We made a 
similar request to the authors of an earlier pooled 
analysis of cardiometabolic risk factors,18–21 and invited 
them to reanalyse data from their studies and join NCD-
RisC. To identify major sources not accessed through the 
above routes, we searched and reviewed published 
studies as detailed previously,13 and invited all eligible 
studies to join NCD-RisC. Finally, NCD-RisC members 
were periodically asked to review the list of sources from 
their country, to suggest additional sources not in the 
database, and to verify that the included data from their 
country met the inclusion criteria as listed in the 
appendix and that there were no duplicates. 
The list of data sources and their characteristics is 
provided in the appendix. In summary, we included 
data collected on samples of a national, subnational 
(ie, covering one or more subnational regions, or 
more than three communities), or community (one or a 
few communities) population, which had measured 
height and weight. We did not use self-reported height 
and weight because they are subject to biases that 
vary by geography, time, age, sex, and socioeconomic 
characteristics.22–24 Because of these variations, approaches 
to correcting self-reported data leave residual bias.
Statistical analysis
The statistical models used to estimate mean and 
prevalence by country, year, sex, and age are described in 
detail in a statistical paper and related substantive 
papers;13,25–28 the computer code is available from the 
NCD-RisC website. In summary, we organised countries 
into 21 regions, mostly based on geography and national 
income (appendix). The exception was high-income 
English-speaking countries (Australia, Canada, Ireland, 
New Zealand, the UK, and the USA), grouped together in 
one region because BMI and other cardiometabolic risk 
factors have similar trends in these countries, which can 
be distinct from other countries in their geographical 
regions.13,26–28
The model had a hierarchical structure in which 
estimates for each country and year were informed by its 
own data, if available, and by data from other years in the 
same country and from other countries, especially those 
in the same region with data for similar time periods. The 
extent to which estimates for each country-year were 
influenced by data from other years and other countries 
depended on whether the country had data, the sample 
size of data, whether or not they were national, and 
the within-country and within-region variability of the 
available data. The model incorporated non-linear time 
trends comprising linear terms and a second-order 
random walk, all modelled hierarchically. The age 
association of BMI was modelled using a cubic spline to 
allow non-linear age patterns, which might vary across 
countries. The model accounted for the possibility that 
BMI in subnational and community samples might 
systematically differ from nationally representative ones, 
and have larger variation than in national studies. These 
features were implemented by including data-driven 
fixed-effect and random-effect terms for subnational and 
community data. The fixed effects adjusted for systematic 
differences between subnational or community studies 
and national studies. The random effects allowed national 
data to have larger influence on the estimates than 
subnational or community data with similar sample sizes. 
The model also accounted for rural–urban differences in 
BMI, through the use of data-driven fixed effects for rural-
only and urban-only studies. These rural and urban effects 
were weighted by the difference between study-level and 
country-level urbanisation in the year when the study 
was done. The statistical model included a covariate 
(proportion of national population living in urban areas; 
data from the World Urbanization Prospects, 2014 
revision) that is associated with, and helps predict, BMI.29 
Results of model validation are reported elsewhere.13 
We performed all analyses by sex, because there are 
differences in BMI levels and trends in relation to sex.13
We analysed the data on mean BMI and on each of the 
above prevalence categories separately. We re-scaled the

estimated prevalence categories so that the sum of 
different categories was 1·0 in each age, sex, country, and 
year. The average scaling factors across draws ranged 
from 1·03 to 1·07, ie, the sum of the separately estimated 
prevalence categories was close to 1·0.
We fitted the statistical model with the Markov chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and obtained 
5000 
post-burn-in 
samples 
from 
the 
posterior 
distribution of model parameters, which were in turn 
used to obtain the posterior distributions of the above 
primary outcomes, ie, mean BMI and each of the 
prevalence categories. For model fitting, data on 
participants aged 5–19 years were included in the 
analysis of trends in children and adolescents, and on 
participants aged 18 years and older in the analysis of 
trends in adults. Data on participants aged 18 and 
19 years were included in both sets of models because 
these groups form a transitional age from adolescence 
to adulthood, and hence help inform the estimates in 
both groups. Posterior estimates were made in 1-year 
age groups for ages 5–19 years and in 5-year age groups 
for those aged 20 years and older. For presentation, we 
used the posterior estimates for ages 5–19 years for 
children and adolescents, and for ages 20 years 
and older for adults. Age-standardised estimates 
were generated by taking weighted averages of age-
sex-specific estimates, separately for children and 
adolescents and for adults, with use of age weights 
from the WHO standard population.30 Estimates for 
regions and the world were calculated as population-
weighted averages of the constituent country estimates 
by age group and sex. The number of children, 
adolescents, and adults who were underweight, 
overweight, or obese was calculated by multiplying the 
corresponding age-specific prevalence by the population 
by country, year, and sex.
The reported credible intervals (CrI) represent the 
2·5th to 97·5th percentiles of the posterior distributions. 
The uncertainties of our estimates, represented by the 
widths of the credible intervals, arise from uncertainty 
due to sampling in each data source; uncertainty 
associated with the variability of national data beyond 
what is accounted for by sampling; additional uncertainty 
associated with subnational and community data, and 
data that are from rural-only or urban-only samples; and 
uncertainty due to making estimates by country, year, 
and age when data were missing or scarce, in the 
country-year-age group unit for which estimates are 
made, in proximate time periods and ages in that 
country and in other countries in the same region. We 
also report the posterior probability (PP) that an 
estimated increase or decrease represents a truly 
increasing or decreasing trend.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, analysis, interpretation, or writing of the 
report. Country and Regional Data Group members, JB, 
MDC, VB, HB, and BZ had full access to the data in the 
study. The corresponding author had final responsibility 
for the decision to submit for publication.

tribution of data sources and participants is shown in 
the appendix. 1187 (49%) of 2416 data sources were 
from national samples, 390 (16%) covered one or more 
subnational regions, and the remaining 839 (35%) were 
from one or a few communities (appendix). 583 (24%) 
of 2416 data sources were from before 1995 and another 
1833 (76%) were from 1995 and later (appendix). The 
number of data sources per country in different regions 
ranged from 3·4 in the Caribbean to 54·0 in the high-
income Asia-Pacific region (appendix).
In 1975, the global age-standardised mean BMI of 
children and adolescents aged 5–19 years was 17·2 kg/m² 
(95% CrI 16·8–17·6) for girls (figure 1) and 16·8 kg/m² 
(16·3–17·2) for boys (figure 2). Mean BMI was lowest in 
south Asia, with an age-standardised mean of 15·8 kg/m² 
(15·2–16·3) for girls and 15·0 kg/m² (14·5–15·6) for 
boys, followed by east Africa (16·5 kg/m² [14·8–18·2] for 
girls and 15·5 kg/m² [13·6–17·4] for boys). Girls in 
Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia, and the high-
income English-speaking region had the highest age-
standardised mean BMI in 1975, all above 19·0 kg/m². 
The highest mean BMIs for boys were those in Polynesia 
and Micronesia (19·1 kg/m², 18·0–20·2), followed by the 
high-income English-speaking region.
From 1975 to 2016, children’s and adolescents’ age-
standardised mean BMI increased globally and in most 
regions (figures 1 and 2). The global increase was 
0·32 kg/m² per decade (95% CrI 0·23–0·41, PP of the 
observed increase being a true increase>0·9999) for girls 
and 0·40 kg/m² per decade (0·30–0·50, PP>0·9999) for 
boys, leading to virtually identical age-standardised mean 
BMIs of 18·6 kg/m² (18·4–18·7) for girls and 18·5 kg/m² 
(18·3–18·7) for boys in 2016. The corresponding figures 
for adults were 24·8 kg/m² (24·6–25·0) in women and 
24·5 kg/m² (24·3–24·6) in men.
Regional change in girls ranged from virtually no 
change (–0·01 kg/m² per decade [95% CrI –0·42 to 0·39; 
PP 
of 
the 
observed 
decrease 
being 
a 
true 
decrease=0·5098]) in eastern Europe to 1·00 kg/m² 
increase per decade (0·69–1·35, PP>0·9999) in central 
Latin America and 0·95 kg/m² per decade (0·64–1·25, 
PP>0·9999) in Polynesia and Micronesia. The range for 
boys was from 0·09 kg/m² per decade (–0·33 to 0·49; 
PP=0·6926) in eastern Europe to 0·77 kg/m² per decade 
(0·50–1·06, PP>0·9999) in Polynesia and Micronesia. 
In some regions, children’s and adolescents’ BMI 
increased gradually over the four decades of analysis 
(figures 1 and 2). However, there has been a recent 
flattening of trends in northwestern Europe and the 
high-income English-speaking and Asia-Pacific regions 
for both sexes, southwestern Europe for boys, and central 
and Andean Latin America for girls. With the exception 
of women in the high-income Asia-Pacific region, adult 
mean BMI continues to increase in all of these regions 
and sexes (figures 1 and 2). By contrast with this 
plateauing, the rise in mean BMI has accelerated since 
around 2000 in east and south Asia for both sexes, and in 
southeast Asia for boys.
The lowest mean child and adolescent BMIs in 2016 
were still those in south Asia and east Africa, with age-
standardised mean BMIs between 16·9 and 17·9 kg/m² 
for girls and boys; the highest were those in Polynesia 
and Micronesia for both sexes, followed by Melanesia 
and the high-income English-speaking region. Age-
standardised mean BMIs of girls and boys in Polynesia 
and Micronesia, which were 23·1 kg/m² (95% CrI 
22·4–23·8) and 22·4 kg/m² (21·6–23·1), respectively, 
were higher than those of adults in some regions. 
Children’s and adolescents’ age-standardised mean BMI 
was also more than 20 kg/m² in Melanesia and many 
parts of Latin America and the Caribbean.
The regional rankings in 2016 differed slightly between 
children aged 5–9 years and adolescents aged 10–19 years 
(appendix). For example, the lowest mean BMI in 
children aged 5–9 years was seen in east Africa in both 
sexes, whereas in those aged 10–19 years, south Asian 
girls and boys had lower mean BMI than their African 
peers. Polynesians and Micronesians had the highest 
mean BMI in those aged 5–9 and 10–19 years, with the

subsequent spots held by the high-income English-
speaking region, regions in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, and Melanesia. Among these regions, central 
Latin America had a poorer ranking (ie, higher BMI 
relative to other regions) at age 10–19 years than at age 
5–9 years, as did boys in the high-income English-
speaking region. By contrast, east Asia performed worse 
in ranking in 5–9 years of age than it did in 10–19 years.
The lowest age-standardised mean BMI over the 
42 years of analysis among girls was in Bangladesh in 
1975 (15·6 kg/m², 95% CrI 13·2–17·9), and among boys 
was in Ethiopia in 1975 (14·4 kg/m², 11·9–17·0; figures 3 
and 4). Age-standardised mean BMI in 1975 was less 
than 21 kg/m² in every country, except for girls in 
American Samoa, who had an age-standardised mean 
BMI of 21·2 kg/m² (20·6–21·9). From 1975 to 2016, 
age-standardised mean BMI increased by more than 
0·25 kg/m² per decade in 155 countries in girls, with the 
rise more than 1·0 kg/m² per decade in some countries 
in Polynesia and in Mexico (PP of being a true 
rise>0·9999); in boys, the rise was more than 0·25 kg/m² 
per decade in 189 countries and more than 1·0 kg/m² per 
decade in the Cook Islands. When subsets of the analysis 
period are considered, before the year 2000, age-
standardised mean BMI increased in almost every 
country. After 2000, there were non-significant declines 
in mean BMI in 29 countries for girls and 12 (mostly 
high-income) countries for boys.
In 2016, Ethiopia had the lowest age-standardised 
mean BMI for both sexes, 16·8 kg/m² (95% CrI 
15·6–17·9) for girls and 15·5 kg/m² (14·4–16·6) for boys 
(figures 3 and 4). Other countries with low BMI in both 
sexes in 2016 were Niger, Senegal, India, Bangladesh, 
Myanmar, and Cambodia. At the other extreme, age-
standardised mean BMI was more than 24 kg/m² in girls 
and boys in the Cook Islands and Niue and girls in 
Samoa, which was greater than that for adults of the 
same sex in 36 countries for girls and 59 countries 
for boys. Age-standardised mean BMI was between 
22 and 24 kg/m² in another 11 countries for girls and 
10 countries for boys including in Polynesian and 
Micronesian islands, girls in the Bahamas and Chile, 
and boys in Qatar and Kuwait.
The age-standardised mean BMI for children and 
adolescents and for adults were correlated in 1975 and 
2016 (correlation coefficients 0·80 and 0·85 for females 
and 0·92 and 0·89 for males; figure 5). Changes in age-
standardised mean BMI were moderately correlated 
between the two age groups before 2000 (correlation 
coefficient 0·52 for females and 0·51 for males) but only 
weakly after 2000 (correlation coefficient 0·14 for females 
and 0·21 for males; figure 6). The decoupling of BMI 
trends in children and adolescents and those of adults is 
due to a set of distinct regional phenomena: adults 
continued to gain weight in most western countries, 
where children’s and adolescents’ mean BMI stopped 
rising. By contrast, the rise in adult BMI seems to have 
plateaued in Oceania, albeit at high levels, whereas 
children’s and adolescents’ BMI continues to rise. In 
Latin America and the Caribbean, there is more variation 
in the rate of BMI increase in children and adolescents 
than in adults.
In 1975, girls had higher age-standardised mean BMI 
than boys in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, south 
Asia, and the Middle East and north Africa, and lower 
age-standardised mean BMI than boys in many countries 
in Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean 
(figure 7). Higher BMI in girls than boys was still seen in 
2016 in many sub-Saharan African and south Asian 
countries. By contrast, the gap between sexes in BMI in 
the Middle East and north Africa shrank or reversed as 
boys gained more weight than girls. In Europe and Latin 
America, girls gained more weight than boys, closing the 
gap between sexes in BMI.
Over the 42 years of analysis, the global age-
standardised prevalence of obesity in children and 
adolescents increased from 0·7% (95% CrI 0·4–1·2) in 
1975 to 5·6% (4·8–6·5) in 2016 in girls (figure 8), and 
from 0·9% (0·5–1·3) in 1975 to 7·8% (6·7–9·1) in 2016 
in boys (figure 9). Obesity increased in every region, with 
proportional rise being smallest in high-income regions

(on average 30–50% per decade) and largest in southern 
Africa (about 400% per decade, albeit from very low 
levels).
Globally, the prevalence of moderate and severe 
underweight changed less than the rise in obesity, 
from 9·2% (95% CrI 6·0–12·9) in 1975 to 8·4% 
(6·8–10·1) in 2016 in girls and from 14·8% (10·4–19·5) 
in 1975 to 12·4% (10·3–14·5) in 2016 in boys. The 
relatively small change in moderate and severe under-
weight prevalence at the global level, however, was 
partly due to faster population growth in regions where 
underweight prevalence is higher (eg, the share of 
children and adolescents living in south Asia, where 
prevalence is highest, increased from 20·5% in 1975 to 
26·4% in 2016 in girls, and 21·1% in 1975 to 27·1% in 
2016 in boys) while prevalence declined in most 
regions. The largest proportional decline in the 
prevalence of moderate and severe underweight 
occurred in Polynesia and Micronesia and in southern 
Africa in both sexes, where prevalence declined by an 
average of up to one third per decade for girls and by 
about one fifth per decade for boys from 1975 to 2016 
(figures 8 and 9). There was a non-significant rise of 
about 6% per decade (PP=0·6630) in underweight in 
girls in southeast Asia. Nonetheless, in most regions, 
the increase in the prevalence of overweight and 
obesity was larger than the decline in the prevalence of 
underweight (figures 8 and 9), ie, the width of the BMI 
distribution increased.
Regionally, moderate and severe underweight preva-
lence was highest in south Asia over the entire analysis 
period, at 20·3% (95% CrI 15·3–25·8) in girls and 28·6% 
(22·3–35·0) in boys in 2016, having decreased from 
23·0% (13·9–33·6) in girls and 37·8% (26·6–49·2) in 
boys in 1975. Prevalence of obesity was highest in 
Polynesia and Micronesia in both sexes, 25·4% 
(16·8–35·2) in girls and 22·4% (13·4–32·9) in boys, 
followed by the high-income English-speaking region.
Nationally, the prevalence of moderate and severe 
underweight was less than 1% among girls in 
45 countries and among boys in 29 countries in 2016 
(figure 3). Prevalence of moderate and severe under-
weight was high throughout south Asia, reaching 22·7% 
(95% CrI 16·7–29·6) among girls and 30·7% 
(23·5–38·0) among boys in India. Obesity prevalence 
was between 1% and 2% among girls in Cambodia, 
Burkina Faso, Vietnam, Ethiopia, India, Madagascar, 
Republic of the Congo, Japan, Nepal, Niger, and Chad. 
Obesity prevalence was less than 1% among boys in 
Uganda, Rwanda, Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, 
Guinea, Chad, and Senegal and between 1% and 2% in 
another 24 countries.
Conversely, obesity prevalence was more than 30% in 
girls in Nauru, the Cook Islands, and Palau and boys in 
the Cook Islands, Nauru, Palau, Niue, and American 
Samoa in 2016, and was also high, around or above 20%, 
in some countries in Polynesia and Micronesia, the 
Middle East and north Africa (eg, Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, 
and Saudi Arabia), the Caribbean (Bermuda and 
Puerto Rico), and in the USA. In 1975, obesity prevalence 
was less than 10% in every country except Nauru and 
Bermuda, where it was still less than 20%. From 
1975 to 2016, obesity prevalence increased in every 
country, although the increase was not statistically 
significant in some high-income countries.
The number of moderately and severely underweight 
girls and boys worldwide peaked around the year 2000, 
and subsequently decreased to 75 (95% CrI 44–117) 
million girls and 117 (70–178) million boys in 2016, 
slightly higher than in 1975 (figure 10). In most regions, 
the number of moderately and severely underweight 
children and adolescents decreased despite population 
growth. The exceptions were south Asia; southeast Asia; 
and central, east, and west Africa, where population 
growth led to an increase in the absolute underweight 
burden, despite declining prevalence. 47·5 million (63%)

population.
The number of girls with obesity increased from 
5 (95% CrI 1–14) million in 1975 to 50 (24–89) million in

390 (363–418) million in 2016; the number of men with 
obesity increased from 31 (24–39) million in 1975 to 
281 (257–307) million in 2016. An additional 213 million 
children and adolescents and 1·30 billion adults were in 
the overweight range, but below the threshold for obesity.
Discussion
Mean BMI and prevalence of obesity increased worldwide 
in children and adolescents from 1975 to 2016, with the 
rate of change in mean BMI moderately correlated with 
that of adults until around 2000, but only weakly 
correlated afterwards. The trend in children’s and 
adolescents’ mean BMI has plateaued, albeit at high 
levels, in many high-income countries since around 
2000, but has accelerated in east, south, and southeast 
Asia. Despite this rise, more children and adolescents 
worldwide are moderately or severely underweight than 
obese. However, if post-2000 trends continue, child and 
adolescent obesity is expected to surpass moderate and 
severe underweight by 2022.
No prior global analyses of mean BMI and underweight 
have been done in children aged over 5 years and 
adolescents. For overweight and obesity, our results are 
not directly comparable with those of Ng and colleagues31 
because the two studies covered different age ranges 
(2–19 years in Ng and colleagues’31 study compared with 
5–19 years in our study), used different classification 
systems for defining overweight and obesity (WHO in 
our study versus International Obesity Task Force [IOTF], 
by Ng and colleagues31), and differed in criteria for

including data (only measured height and weight in our 
study versus measured and self-reported by Ng and 
colleagues31). Nonetheless, both studies concluded that 
the rise in excess weight in children and adolescents 
has plateaued in high-income countries but continues in 
low-income and middle-income countries. The plateau 
in children’s and adolescents’ overweight and obesity in 
high-income countries32–34 and the relatively rapid 
transition from underweight to overweight and obesity 
in low-income and middle-income countries35,36 have also 
been noted in specific countries.
Our study is the first to make comparable estimates of 
mean BMI and the prevalence of a complete set of BMI 
categories with clinical and public health relevance—
from underweight to obesity. We used an unprecedented 
amount of population-based data from almost all of the 
world’s countries, while maintaining a high standard of 
data quality and using only measured height and weight 
data to avoid the bias in self-reported data. Characteristics 
of data sources were verified through repeated checks 
by NCD-RisC members, and data that could be 
systematically different from the general population 
were excluded, eg, those from samples of students or of 
ever-married women in ages and countries with low 
school enrolment or marriage rates. Data were analysed 
according to a common protocol to obtain the required 
mean and prevalence by age and sex. Finally, we used a 
statistical model that used all available data while giving 
more weight to national data than subnational and 
community studies, and took into account the epi-
demiological features of outcomes such as BMI by using 
non-linear time trends and age associations, and 
differences between rural and urban populations.
Despite using the most comprehensive global data-
base of human anthropometry to date, some countries 
and regions had fewer data sources, especially those in 
the Caribbean, Polynesia and Micronesia, Melanesia, 
and central Asia. The scarcity of data is reflected in 
wider uncertainty intervals of our estimates for these 
countries and regions. Of sources with data on children 
and adolescents, 39·9% had data for 5–9 years of age, 
50·3% for 10–14 years, and 78·9% for 15–19 years. 
Many sources with data on children aged 5–9 years 
were school-based measurement studies in high-
income countries where school enrolment is almost 
universal. The relative paucity of data on children aged 
5–9 years restricted our capacity to compare trends in 
this age group with those of adolescents, despite some 
evidence from high-income countries that trends are 
somewhat different before and after 10 years of age.33 
Finally, although the age-dependent cutoffs for defining 
overweight and obesity in children and adolescents 
reflect natural growth in these ages, they are based on 
BMI distributions in a reference population, and not 
explicitly selected to represent optimal BMI levels for 
health in prospective studies, as done for adults, or 
optimal nutritional status, as done for children younger 
than 5 years. The reference population used by WHO,16 
and the cutoffs for defining overweight and obesity, 
differ from those used by IOTF37,38 and the US Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specifically, 
in the WHO classification, a BMI of 30 kg/m² at 
ages 18–19 years corresponds to 2 SD (ie, about 
the 97·5th percentile) from the median of the 
reference population;16 in the IOTF classification, a 
BMI of 30 kg/m² at age 18 years corres 
ponds to the 
98·6th percentile for girls and the 98·9th percentile for 
boys.38 While at 18 years the two systems classify the 
same children as obese, at younger ages a smaller 
proportion are classified as obese according to the IOTF 
definition compared with the WHO definition.38 For 
this reason, comparisons of overweight and obesity 
prevalence based on the three definitions36,39–42 found 
that prevalence using the WHO classification was 
higher than those of IOTF and CDC, but that trends 
are similar.
The effectiveness of interventions for overweight and 
obesity in children and adolescents has been reviewed in 
several systematic reviews and modelling studies,3,43–47 but 
how they are selected for implementation and their post-
implementation effects at the population level are rarely 
investigated.48 For this reason, there is no systematic 
information on the determinants of the divergent trends 
in BMI in children and adolescents and in adults, be it on 
food environments and behaviours or on policies that 
affect them. The plateauing of children’s and adolescents’ 
BMI in high-income countries as adult BMI continues 
to increase might be due to specific initiatives by 
governments, community groups, schools, and notable 
individuals that have increased public awareness about 
overweight and obesity in children, leading to changes in 
nutrition and activity that are sufficient to curb the rise in 
mean BMI.
A general feature of policies that target overweight 
and obesity in children and adolescents in high-income 
countries is a reluctance to use taxes and industry 
regulations to change eating and drinking behaviours.12,49 
Some middle-income countries are also adopting 
policies to combat overweight and obesity in children 
and adolescents, in some cases with a stronger emphasis 
on regulation and taxes than in high-income countries.48 
While momentum might be gathering to use taxes and 
regulations to reduce the consumption of energy-dense 
foods, few policies and programmes attempt to make 
healthy foods such as whole grains and fresh fruits and 
vegetables more affordable through targeted price 
subsidies, (conditional) cash transfers and food 
vouchers, or healthy school meals.50 Unaffordability of 
healthy food options not only leads to social inequalities 
in overweight and obesity,51,52 but might also limit 
the effect of policies that target unhealthy foods. 
Finally, efforts in population-based prevention of over-
weight and obesity in children and adolescents should 
be matched with enhancing access to health-care

interventions for weight management and for reducing 
the adverse effects of obesity, including intensive 
behavioural therapy to change diet and exercise; 
screening for and management of hypertension, glucose 
intolerance, dyslipidaemia, and abnormal liver function 
in children and adolescents with obesity; and in extreme 
cases bariatric surgery.4,53,54
Our finding that the number of children and 
adolescents aged 5–19 years in the world who are 
moderately or severely underweight remains larger 
than those who are obese shows the continued need for 
policies that enhance food security in low-income 
countries and households, especially in south Asia. Yet 
the experiences of east Asia and Latin America and the 
Caribbean show that the transition from underweight 
to overweight and obesity can be rapid, and overwhelm 
the national capacity needed to engender a healthy 
transition. More broadly, in an unhealthy nutritional 
transition, an increase in nutrient-poor, energy-dense 
foods can lead to stunted growth along with weight 
gain in children, adolescents, and adults, resulting in 
higher BMI and worse health outcomes throughout 
the life-course. Therefore, the findings from our 
comprehensive analysis of trends in underweight, as 
well as overweight and obesity highlight the disconnect 
between the global dialogue on overweight and 
obesity, which has largely overlooked the remaining 
undernutrition burden, and the initiatives and donors 
focusing on undernutrition that have paid little 
attention to the looming burden of overweight and 
obesity, itself a risk factor for adverse pregnancy 
outcomes.2 The Sustainable Development Goals, which 
address poverty, education, nutrition, and universal 
health coverage, provide an opportunity for integrating 
policies that coherently address underweight and 
overweight in children and adolescents, and their 
health consequences, effectively and equitably. Doing 
so would require commitment from national and 
international agencies and donors for replacing the 
fragmented focus with an integrated approach.
