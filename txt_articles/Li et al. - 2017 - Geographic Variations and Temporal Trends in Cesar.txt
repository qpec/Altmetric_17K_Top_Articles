O
veruse of cesarean delivery can jeopardize maternal
and child health.1,2 Concerns about “alarming”3 rates
in China increased after the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO)4 reported that 46.2% of births were delivered by
cesarean in the years 2007 and 2008, based on an analysis of
14 541 deliveries in 21 hospitals in 3 provinces.
With a population of approximately 1.37 billion in
2014, China’
s health care use is of substantial global inter-
est. Over the past 2 decades, the nation has invested in
improving maternal and child health. The Law on Maternal
and Infant Health Care was passed in 1995 to provide a
high-quality hospital delivery to all women.5 Health insur-
ance expansion began in 2003, to provide better financial
access to maternity care.6 In 2009, a comprehensive health
care reform plan included subsidies for in-hospital delivery
to pregnant women in rural areas.7 In 2008, 89.9% of
deliveries occurred in hospitals, and 87.9% of families had
health insurance.6 By 2014, 99.6% of deliveries occurred in
hospitals.8
China’
s increasing cesarean rate has been spurred by
many factors, including expanded access to hospital care,
medicolegal concerns, financial incentives for physicians
to perform cesareans, and parents’ focus on having a
“perfect baby” under the one-child policy.9,10 Since 2002,
reducing the cesarean rate has been a national priority,11 and
a variety of policies, programs, and activities have emerged
at the central government,12 provincial or municipal,13
city,14 and city district or county levels.15 There is no national
IMPORTANCE The increasing use of cesarean delivery is an emerging global health issue.
Prior estimates of China’s cesarean rate have been based on surveys with limited
geographic coverage.
OBJECTIVE To provide updated information about cesarean rates and geographic variation in
cesarean use in China.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND DATA SOURCES Descriptive study, covering every county
(n = 2865) in mainland China’s 31 provinces, using county-level aggregated information
on the number of live births, cesarean deliveries, maternal deaths, and perinatal deaths,
collected by the Office for National Maternal & Child Health Statistics of China, from 2008
through 2014.
EXPOSURES Live births.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual rate of cesarean deliveries.
RESULTS Over the study period, there were 100 873 051 live births, of which 32 947 229
(32.7%) were by cesarean delivery. In 2008, there were 13 160 634 live births, of which
3 788 029 (28.8%) were by cesarean delivery and in 2014 there were 15 123 276 live births, of
which 5 280 124 (34.9%) were by cesarean delivery. Rates varied markedly by province, from
4.0% to 62.5% in 2014. Despite the overall increase, by 2014 rates of cesarean delieries in 14
of the nation’s 17 “
super cities”had declined by 4.1 to 17.5 percentage points from their earlier
peak values (median, 11.4; interquartile range, 6.3-15.4). In 4 super cities with the largest
decreases, there was no increase in maternal or perinatal mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Between 2008 and 2014, the overall annual rate of cesarean
deliveries increased in China, reaching 34.9%. There was major geographic variation in rates
and trends over time, with rates declining in some of the largest urban areas.

system of birth certificates in China, so national estimates
of cesarean rates have been based on surveys with limited
geographic coverage.4,6,9 Given the marked diversity of
geography, economy, and life circumstances throughout
China, survey estimates are likely to be sensitive to the
area sampled.
The Office for National Maternal & Child Health Statistics
began to collect county-level national data on cesarean rates
in 2008. The objectives of this study were to determine the
overall rate and change in rate of cesarean deliveries, exam-
inegeographicvariation,identifydecreasesinratesandinareas
where decreases occurred, and assess changes in maternal and
perinatal mortality.
Methods
Data Sources
The National Maternal & Child Health Statistics (NMCHS) data
set,ourprimarysource,hascollectedmaternalandchildhealth
records since the mid-1990s. The Peking University Health Sci-
ence Center Institutional Review Board did not need to ap-
prove this study because we used previously collected data
containing no information on individual patients.
The dataset consists of county-level indicators of mater-
nal and child health and health care service use, covering all
counties and all births, primarily reported by county mater-
nal and child health care hospitals. Indicators in the dataset
serve as an important data source for government decision
making. The total number of live births has long been consid-
ered gold standard information and has been used as basic
information for the deployment of health resources
nationally.8,16 The set of indicators is reviewed every 2 to 3
years to reflect current health priorities. In 2008, information
on cesarean deliveries was added in response to reports of
increasing cesarean rates.
The total number of births in a county is reported in the
database separately for resident and nonresident births. Resi-
dent births in a county refer to those to mothers or fathers
with “Hukou” status (residential birth status) in the province
in which that county is located. Nonresident births refer to
those whose parents’Hukou status is in other provinces.
Typically, these are births to Chinese nationals working out-
side of their residential birth province. Although all births are
reported, delivery mode (vaginal vs cesarean) is reported
only for births to residents.
Data for in-hospital and out-of-hospital births are col-
lected through China’
s 3-tier system, the national maternal
and child health data reporting network.17 Every county,
every township, and every village countrywide has at least 1
person assigned to the network. In rural areas, village-level
staff jointly work with township staff to collect birth in-
formation (including method of delivery) in the catchment
area. Township staff report to the county every 1 to 6
months. In urban areas, the subdistrict physicians or clini-
cians collect individual-level data and transmit reports to
the city district office every 1 to 6 months. County-level
data are aggregated and reported annually. Until 2014, data
were tabulated on standardized electronic spreadsheets at
county offices and then reported to city and provincial
offices and then to the Office for the National Maternal &
Child Health Statistics by email. Since 2014, the county-
level aggregated data has been reported directly via an
online reporting system.
The Office for the National Maternal & Child Health
Statistics oversees data quality, receives funds to train data
collectors and managers, and provides annual training to
provincial staff, visiting 2 to 3 provinces for quality control
every year. Provincial staff train city staff, who train county
staff. Provincial staff visit 2 to 3 cities, and city staff visit 2
to 3 counties for quality control every year. Quality control
focuses primarily on the source data of all the indicators,
particularly the number of live births and mortality data.
Training on reporting the number of cesarean deliveries is
provided to health workers, with a particular emphasis on
counting the number of cesarean deliveries as the number
of newborns in twin or multiple pregnancies (ie, the num-
ber of cesarean deliveries for twin births is 2). The reports of
cesarean rates have not been validated by audit.
Secondary data sources included the China County Sta-
tistics online database18 and data on geographic boundaries
in China.19
Data Extraction and Cleaning, Calculation of Rates,
and Geographic Aggregation
County-level information on the number of live births,
cesarean deliveries, maternal deaths, stillbirths, and early
neonatal deaths was extracted for all counties from 2008
through 2014. In all, 20 042 county-year records were
extracted, with 24 records excluded for missing data. Prior
to any analysis 2 authors familiar with the data identified
obvious data entry errors, excluding 206 additional county-
years (1.0%). Linkage with county gross domestic product
(GDP) per capita data resulted in the removal of 63 addi-
tional county-years. In all, 19 749 county-years from 2865
counties (98.5% of county-years) were included in the
analyses.
Cesarean rates were defined as the percentage of cesar-
ean deliveries, maternal mortality as the number of mater-
nal deaths (while pregnant or within 42 days of termination
of pregnancy) per 100 000 live births, and perinatal mortal-
ity as the number of stillbirths (≥28 weeks of gestation) and
early neonatal deaths (0-6 days) per 1000 births. As noted
above, information about delivery mode is only available for
Key Points
Question How has the rate of cesarean delivery in China changed
between 2008 and 2014?
Findings Cesarean rates increased from 28.8% in 2008 to 34.9%
in 2014. However, there was substantial variation across China’s 31
provinces, with rates ranging from 4.0% to 62.5% in 2014.
Meaning In 2014, the overall cesarean rate of 34.9% in China was
close to the US rate of 32.4%, but there was large geographic
variation in rates.

resident women. Therefore, we report the total numbers of
births and cesarean rates for resident women as the main
outcome but also performed tests to assess the sensitivity of
our findings to the inclusion of nonresident women, using
varying assumptions about their delivery patterns.
Although data were reported at the county level, some
analyses rates were calculated at higher levels as aggrega-
tions of counties.
Cross-Validation of NMCHS Cesarean Rates
We validated NMCHS county-level cesarean rates against
rates reported in 2 sample-based studies.4,6 We approxi-
mated the aggregate rates that we would have gotten from
the NMCHS data, had we used each of the 2 sampling strate-
gies, using published information about those strategies. For
the 2009-2011 China National Health Services Survey, across
the 94 sampled counties for the 2010 midpoint year, we cal-
culated the arithmetic mean of the NMCHS cesarean rate.6
For the 2008 WHO survey, to each of the 21 sampled hospi-
tals we assigned the NMCHS cesarean rate for the hospital’
s
corresponding geographic unit (city, county, or city district),
and took the arithmetic mean of those 21 cesarean rates.4 We
also validated the rates against audited rates from a major
city (Tianjin in 2009 and 2011).20
Data Analysis
Main Analysis
For each year, the national cesarean rate was calculated by ag-
gregating county-level rates, weighting each county-level rate
by the number of births to resident women in the county for
that year. In other words, the national rate was
Σn
i=1(wi × CSratei)/Σn
i=1wi × 100%
for which n equals the number of counties; wi, the num-
ber of births in the ith county; and CSratei, the cesarean rate in
the ith county.
We compared secular trends in cesarean rates between
subgroups of counties defined by (1) degree of urbanization
(rural counties, general city counties, and super city coun-
ties); rural county refers to rural areas of a city, general city
county refers to urban areas of a city with a population of less
than 5 million, and super city county refers to urban areas of a
city with a population of 5 million or more21; (2) cesarean rate
in 2008, the start of the period (<30.0%, 30.0%-44.9%, and
≥ 45.0%); and (3) GDP per capita tertile in 2008. We per-
formed stratified Poisson regression with generalized esti-
mating equations, using the cesarean rate as the dependent
variable and calendar year as the independent variable to
examine trends in cesarean rates for subgroups. Significant
differences in secular trends between subgroups were
assessed by adding an interaction term between calendar
year and corresponding characteristics defining subgroups.
We used a geographic information system to display cesarean
rates in 2008 and 2014 for all counties, and used funnel plots
to display the extent to which the county-level variation in
cesarean rates exceeded that of random fluctuations alone.22
To assess the clustering effects in county-level cesarean
rates within cities and provinces, we calculated intraclass
correlation coefficients for county cesarean rates by using
multilevel random intercept models, for which cesarean
rates for counties nested within cities and provinces were
considered as repeated measurements at level 1, each city
represented a unit at level 2, and each province represented
a unit at level 3.
We graphed rates of cesarean and perinatal and maternal
mortality to visually inspect whether reductions in cesarean
rates appeared to be accompanied by an increase in maternal
and perinatal deaths in super cities, where high cesarean
rates have been the historical norm.23 We used Poisson
regression with generalized estimating equations, with mor-
tality as the dependent variable and calendar year as the
independent variable, to examine whether perinatal or
maternal mortality increased over the study period, in super
cities with substantial reductions in rates over time (>15%
from the peak rate), in which the greatest effect of substitu-
tion would be expected.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 20.0,
using 2-tailed tests and a significance level of P < .05. Geo-
graphic analysis used ArcGIS 10.2 for Desktop Advanced,
Student Edition.
Sensitivity of National Rates to Inclusion of Nonresident Women
We projected hypothetical overall (resident and nonresident)
national rates under 2 assumptions: (1) rates for nonresident
women are the same as for local resident women, and (2) rates
for nonresident women are one-third lower than rates for lo-
cal resident women, consistent with a recent report from the
same period from Shanghai,24 a super city.
Results
Cross-Validation of Cesarean Rates
In 2010, the arithmetic mean NMCHS rate across the 94
counties that participated in the 2009-2011 Health Services
Survey was 37.3%, close to the national rate of 36.3%
reported by the National Health Services Survey6 (eTable 1
in the Supplement). In 2008, the arithmetic mean NMCHS
rate across the cities, counties, or city districts housing the
21 hospitals sampled by the WHO was 46.5%, close to the
46.2% rate reported by the WHO4 (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). When cesareans were audited by the Tianjin health
department, rates were 68.9% in 2009 and 56.7% in 2011.20

Corresponding rates from the NMCHS were 71.5% and
60.5%, respectively.
Main Findings
From 2008 through 2014, there were 100 873 051 live births
in the 2865 counties. Of these, 32 947 229 were by cesarean
delivery, resulting in an overall national rate of 32.7%.
Cesarean deliveries increased from 3 788 029 of 13 160 634
live births (a rate of 28.8%) in 2008 to 5 280 124 of 15 123 276
live births (a rate of 34.9%) in 2014, a mean increase of
1.0 (SD, 0.5) percentage point per year (Table 1). Growth
was initially faster (1.8 percentage point increase from 2008
to 2009), but slowed by the end of the period (0.3 percent-
age point increase from 2013 to 2014). The range in provin-
cial rates was large: Tibet had the lowest at 4% and Jilin
the highest at 62.5% in 2014 (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
There was substantial geographic clustering of rates
(Figure 1). The intraclass correlation coefficient for county
cesarean rates within cities and provinces was 0.752 in
2008 and 0.774 in 2014. In other words, 75.2% and 77.4%
of the variation in county-level rates was accounted for by
the regional clustering of cesarean rates within cities and
provinces in 2008 and 2014, respectively. As shown by
funnel plots (eFigure in the Supplement), variations in
county cesarean rates far exceeded those expected by ran-
dom fluctuation.
The high variability in rates is further quantified in
Table 2. For example, in 2014, 19.6% of births were in coun-
ties where the cesarean rate was 20% or less, and 35.9%
were in counties with rates greater than 40%. Figure 2
shows some county-level factors that were associated with
levels and trends. As supported by the interaction test,
there were diverse trends in cesarean rates among sub-
groups of counties defined by degree of urbanization, cesar-
ean rate in 2008, and county GDP per capita tertile in 2008;
corresponding P values for interaction tests were all <.001.
Rates were highest in super cities and lowest in rural areas.
Over the period, rates increased linearly in rural and general
urban areas (P values for trend <.001) but declined beyond
baseline rates in super cities (P for trend <.001) (Figure 2, A).
Consistent with this, overall rates decreased over time in
areas that had the highest baseline rates (P for trend <.001),
but increased substantially in those with the lowest and
intermediate rates (P for trend <.001) (Figure 2, B). Local
economic conditions were associated with rates: high GDP
per capita counties started with the highest rates, but
showed the smallest increase over time (Figure 2, C).
In 2008 cesarean rates in the 17 super cities were
between 18.2% and 68.8% (median, 48.7%; interquartile
range [IQR], 40.6% to 64.1%); by 2014 rates in 4 super cities
had declined by more than 15 percentage points from early in
the study period (ie, 2008 or 2009); rates in 5 super cities
decreased by 10.1 to 15 percentage points and in another 5
super cities by 4.1 to 10 percentage points from their peak
values, which generally appeared in the middle of the study
period (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
In the 4 super cities with the most pronounced reduc-
tion in cesarean rates, neither maternal nor perinatal mor-
tality appeared to increase over the period (Figure 3). Statis-
tical tests were consistent with this: the estimated annual
percent change in maternal mortality was −12.8 (95% CI,
−25.2 to 1.8; P = .08) in Beijing, −5.0 (95% CI, −18.5 to 10.8;
P = .52) in Tianjin, −6.5 (95% CI, −20.5 to 10; P = .42) in
Shanghai, and −5.5 (95% CI, −17.7 to 8.5; P = .42) in Hang-
zhou. For perinatal mortality, the corresponding estimates
were −2.6 (95% CI, −4.9 to −0.4; P = .02) in Beijing, −7.1
(95% CI, −10.4 to −3.7; P < .001) in Tianjin, −2.2 (95% CI,
−6.0 to 1.7; P = .26) in Shanghai, and −0.3 (95% CI, −4.4 to
4.0; P = .89) in Hangzhou.
Sensitivity of National Rates to Inclusion
of Nonresident Women
In addition to the 100 873 051 births to resident women
included in the main analysis, there were an additional
10 083 398 births to nonresident women (10% additional
births). The hypothetical overall (resident and nonresident)
national rates under the assumption that cesarean rates
for nonresident women were the same as local resident
women was 33.7% for the entire study period (eTable 5 in
the Supplement). Under the assumption that cesarean rates
were one-third lower for nonresident women, the corre-
sponding rate was 32.4% (eTable 6 in the Supplement). Both
are close to the rate in the resident population (32.7%).
Year-specific rates under both assumptions are also close to

those of the resident population (maximum difference,
1.3 percentage points), suggesting that births to nonresi-
dents have a limited influence on the national rate. How-
ever, since nonresidents cluster in super cities, those rates
are most sensitive to differential delivery patterns. For
example, following the second assumption, the overall rate
in Beijing dropped from 52.4% to 44.6% and in Shanghai
from 60.9% to 50.8%.
Discussion
In this data source with national coverage including 90% of
all deliveries over 7 years in China, estimates of cesarean rates
were substantially lower than those reported previously.4 In
2014, the rate was 34.9%, a figure more comparable with that
of the United States (32.2% in 201425) than rates reported for
such middle-income countries as Brazil (56%26). Despite the
overall increased trend, the growth rate had slowed by the end
of study period.
Rates varied markedly across China. Even in 2014 they re-
mained low in some rural areas, relative to the 19% rate that
was recently estimated as a threshold target for improving ma-
ternal and child health.27 Clinical data that would allow evalu-
ation of the appropriateness of rates were not available, so de-
finitive conclusions about overuse and underuse cannot be

Rural refers to rural areas of a city, general city refers to urban areas of a city
with a population of less than 5 million, and super city refers to urban areas of a
city with a population of �5 million.
A, As estimated by Poisson regression analyses with generalized estimating
equations, the annual percent changes in cesarean delivery rate were −1.6 (95%
CI, −2.1 to −1.0; P < .001) for super cities, 1.3 (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.7; P < .001) for
general cities, and 4.9 (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.2; P < .001) for rural areas. B, −1.1 (95%

to 45%, and 8.8 (95% CI, 8.5 to 9.2; P < .001) for counties with cesarean rates
that are less than 30%. C, 2.4 (95% CI, 2.0 to 2.8; P < .001) for counties with
the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, 5.0 (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.5;
P < .001) for counties with the midrange GDP, and 7.1 (95% CI, 6.4 to 7.7;
P < .001) for counties in the lowest GDP per capita group.

Maternal mortality was defined as the number of maternal deaths (while
pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy) per 100 000 live
births and perinatal mortality as the number of stillbirths (� 28 weeks of
gestation) and early neonatal deaths (0-6 days) per 1000 births.

reached. But in some areas rates so far exceeded the 19%
threshold that overuse seems likely, especially in urban areas,
super cities, and areas with a high GDP per capita.
Rates decreased in 14 of the 17 super cities over the study
period, with more than 15% decreases in 4 super cities. Four
super cities with the greatest reductions did not show in-
creasesinratesofmaternalorperinatalmortality,whichiscon-
sistent with—but does not prove—that the substitution of ce-
sarean with vaginal delivery was not associated with an
increase in mortality. It is possible that concurrent improve-
ments in health or health care outcomes for women and chil-
drenmaskednegativehealtheffectsofsubstitution.Also,other
adverseoutcomespotentiallyrelatingtomodeofdelivery,such
as neonatal injury, neonatal mortality, and maternal morbid-
ity, were not measured, nor were trends in outcomes ex-
plored in areas where cesarean rates increased.
Over the study period, there were many national and
local efforts to reduce the cesarean rate across China. Inter-
ventions included patient and clinician education, hands-on
training for obstetricians and midwives, setting local target
rates, and more recently financial or practice disincentives
for failure to reach target goals.13-15 Causal links to these poli-
cies and programs cannot be evaluated with these data for
many reasons: information about implementation was sparse
and clinical data were limited. However, reduction of cesar-
ean rates in some areas may have coincided with some of
these policies and programs.
During the study period, cesarean rates in poorer and ru-
ral counties increased. The percent of counties with rates of
less than 10% was 18.5% in 2008, decreasing to 7.4% in 2014
(Table 2). This likely reflects the improvement in cesarean ser-
vice capacity of health facilities as well as lower financial bar-
riers to care in rural areas.6,7
Limitations, Caveats, and Strengths
The analysis was based on aggregated data; no patient-level
clinical data were available with which to adjust the rate
estimates, and so some of the variability reported may
reflect cross-area clinical heterogeneity in indications for
cesarean. A recent report from the United Kingdom found
that cesarean rate variability declined after clinical adjust-
ment, but variance in patient population could not explain
persistent wide variation in rates.28 It seems unlikely that
the extreme variability in China was largely accounted for
by variations in clinical factors. Variability could also reflect
a number of different health system factors, including dif-
ferences in clinician training, facility capacity, or financial
incentives. It could also reflect variations in local patient
preferences. Examination of these are beyond the scope of
the study.
This study used a census, rather than a sample. The
NMCHS data emanate from a data collection system that has
been in place since the 1990s, with quality controls at many
levels. However, NMCHS cesarean rates have not yet been
validated via internal audit. It was therefore reassuring that
the NMCHS rates were consistent with rates derived from
prior survey-based studies, after survey sampling strategies
were taken into account. The NMCHS cesarean rates did not
include nonresident women, who contribute approximately
10% of the births nationally. Evidence points to a lower rate
of cesareans among nonresident women,24,29,30 so we did
not present analyses assuming higher rates for nonresi-
dents. Given the known pattern of lower rates for nonresi-
dents, it seems plausible that the rates reported herein are
overestimates rather than underestimates of the true
national rate.
Conclusions
Between 2008 and 2014, the overall annual rate of cesarean
deliveries increased in China, reaching 34.9%. There was ma-
jorgeographicvariationinratesandtrendsovertime,withrates
declining in some of the largest urban areas.
