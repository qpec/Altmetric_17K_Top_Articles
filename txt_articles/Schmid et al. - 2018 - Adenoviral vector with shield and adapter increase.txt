Most systemic viral gene therapies have been limited by sequestration and degradation of
virions, innate and adaptive immunity, and silencing of therapeutic genes within the target
cells. Here we engineer a high-affinity protein coat, shielding the most commonly used vector
in clinical gene therapy, human adenovirus type 5. Using electron microscopy and crystal-
lography we demonstrate a massive coverage of the virion surface through the hexon-
shielding scFv fragment, trimerized to exploit the hexon symmetry and gain avidity. The
shield reduces virion clearance in the liver. When the shielded particles are equipped with
adaptor proteins, the virions deliver their payload genes into human cancer cells expressing
HER2 or EGFR. The combination of shield and adapter also increases viral gene delivery to
xenografted tumors in vivo, reduces liver off-targeting and immune neutralization. Our study
highlights the power of protein engineering for viral vectors overcoming the challenges of
local and systemic viral gene therapies.

ecent innovations in gene editing technologies and ther-
apeutic benefits in clinical trials with protein therapeutics
have brought the idea of viral gene therapy back to center
stage1. This is highlighted by the approval of the first gene
therapy in the United States and Europe2, an adeno-associated
virus (AAV). Adenoviruses (AdVs) are the most widely used
vectors in clinical gene therapy trials3,4. There are over 65 dif-
ferent human AdV types known, including adenovirus 5 from the
species C (HAdV5), which infects respiratory epithelial cells and
is normally well controlled by innate and adaptive immunity in
immune-competent individuals5. HAdV5 is the best character-
ized adenovirus and a promising vector for gene delivery for the
treatment of human diseases, such as cancer or germline defects6.
HAdV5-based vectors are powerful for viral gene therapy since
they have high transduction efficacy of non-dividing and dividing
cells and can be readily produced in large scale and in clinical
grade quality7. Importantly, the adenoviral genome remains
episomal in transduced cells, which provides a safety margin over
integrating vectors such as lentiviruses8. Recently, the develop-
ment of ‘gutless’ AdVs, which are devoid of viral genes and thus
extend safety margins even further, has enabled the utilization of
up to 35 kilobase pairs (kb) for transgene expression, which
exceeds the capacity of AAV vectors by one order of magnitude9.
This will allow the delivery of multiple payload genes at once, and
potentially the secretion of a cocktail of therapeutic proteins upon
delivery of the non-oncolytic vector to a tumor10, without vector
replication and thus with enhanced safety.
Advances in vector development have significantly improved
adenovirus efficacy, yet the targeting of the vectors to the tissue of
interest by systemic delivery remains a challenge. One hurdle is
the strong liver tropism of HAdV5 upon intravenous adminis-
tration, minimizing the delivery efficacy to a tumor11. Other
limitations are the preexisting humoral immunity against the
vector and the innate and adaptive immune responses triggered
by the vector12. Antibody neutralization of the virion can occur at
the level of virus entry into cells, for example, by blocking
receptor binding or endosomal escape of the virion13,14. For
AdVs, antibody-dependent intracellular neutralization (ADIN)
constitutes another pathway of neutralization, which targets the
virion to proteasomal degradation15,16. The innate immune sys-
tem inactivates virions through preexisting immunoglobulin M
(IgM) antibodies and the complement system17,18. Binding of
coagulation factor X (FX) precludes the binding of those anti-
bodies to the virion19. FX binds to the central cavity of a hexon
trimer, thereby creating a shield around the capsid20. On the
other hand, this FX shield enhances the transduction of hepato-
cytes and other cells, likely through virion attachment to heparan
sulfate proteoglycans21. Furthermore, if FX-shielded virions enter
the cytosol, FX can act as a pathogen-associated molecular pat-
tern (PAMP) and trigger innate immunity against the infected
cells, which in turn may reduce the lifetime of the transduced
cells22.
So far, most efforts to shield virions from these undesired
interactions have focused on polymers, like polyethylene glycol
(PEG), N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide or poly(amidoa-
mine), sometimes fused to cationic moieties for simple electro-
static binding to the particles. However, the heterogeneous size of
the polymers, the non-covalent ionic linkage to the capsid and
inherent chemical features of the polymers altered the infectivity
of the virions in unpredictable manners, and largely reduced the
transduction efficiency23,24. Likewise, shielding attempts with
engineered protein coats showed promising results in vitro, but
were ineffective in vivo25.
Besides overcoming detargeting, another challenge for viral
tumor gene therapy is the targeting of the vector to the cancer
cells. Infection of epithelial cells requires interactions of the
vertex-associated fiber and penton base proteins with their cog-
nate receptors, the Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor
(CAR) and αV integrins26,27. These receptor interactions firmly
tether the virion to the cell surface and trigger the first steps of the
virion uncoating program28–31. Virion binding to CAR and
integrin receptors triggers endocytosis and escape to the cytosol
from non-acidic early endosomes32.
Virus retargeting to cancer cell epitopes has been achieved by
genetic
engineering
of
the
fibers32,
or
modular
adapter
systems33,34. The latter has allowed retargeting of HAdV5 to
several cancer biomarkers, such as human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2) or epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)34. The adapter consists of a central fiber knob-binding
Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) fused on one side to
the phage protein SHP, which mediates extremely stable trimer-
ization and thus formation of a highly stable complex of the
DARPins and fiber knob without measureable off-rate over
10 days34. The other end of the fiber knob-binding DARPin is
connected via a flexible linker to an exchangeable retargeting
module that can bind cell surface receptors. In addition to
allowing retargeting to a tumor-specific receptor, the adapter also
blocks large areas of the knob surface, which precludes knob
binding to CAR and thus reduces transduction of CAR-positive
cells.
In order to engineer a protecting function of a coat but without
the liabilities of FX, we designed in this study a ‘stealth’ layer
based on a hexon-binding humanized single-chain antibody
variable fragment (scFv) derived from the murine monoclonal
antibody (mAb) 9C1235. The shield has low pM affinity and
extensively covers the surface of HAdV5, as indicated by single-
particle electron microscopy analyses and an atomic-resolution
crystal structure of the hexon–scFv complex. We demonstrate
maintained in vitro and in vivo transduction efficacy of a novel
engineered FX-ablated non-replicative HAdV5 with a designed
protein shield. By implementing both retargeting and shielding
strategies, we achieved viral gene delivery to two different tumor
models overexpressing HER2 or EGFR in vivo, reduced the off-
targeting to the liver and increased the tumor-to-liver-ratio of the
expressed transgene by a factor of about 2500 compared to naive
HAdV5 vectors.
Results
Adapter-mediated retargeting of capsid-engineered virions.
Biodistribution of therapeutic viruses within the body is subject to
manifold interactions of the virions with tissue-resident and cir-
culating blood cells and lymphoid tissue, as well as soluble factors
like blood coagulation FX. FX endangers the success of an ade-
noviral gene vector as it activates the innate immunity in the
transduced cells22 and mediates liver uptake36. Therefore, we
ablated binding of FX to HAdV5 by mutating the FX binding site
on the hexon as recently reported37. Four mutations in the
hypervariable region 7 (HVR7) of the hexon protein were
introduced (I421G, T423N, E424S and L426Y), resulting in
HAdV5HVR7. To enhance the targeting of virions to tumor cells
of interest, and reduce virion attachment to endogenous fiber
receptors, we made use of the recently developed adapter, which
binds to and blocks the viral fiber knob (Fig. 1a)34.
To test whether FX binding was truly ablated, we infected
SKOV3 cells, which express heparin sulfate proteoglycans on the
cell surface38, with either HAdV5wt or FX-binding-ablated
HAdV5HVR7. With the adapter34 tightly bound to the fiber knob,
CAR-mediated luciferase transgene expression should be reduced,
as only FX-mediated entry was expected to take place. Indeed,
blocking of the fiber knob itself reduced transduction of SKOV3
cells by both HAdV5wt and HAdV5HVR7 (Fig. 1b), and in the

are trimerized through SHP and bind the knob in a quasi-covalent manner34. The retargeting module (orange), a target-specific DARPin, allows binding of
tumor biomarkers like HER2 or EGFR. Non-targeting (control) DARPins are shown in blue. b Hexon-engineered HAdV5HVR7 infects CAR-expressing

 presence of FX, transgene expression of the fiber knob-blocked
HAdV5wt was increased by 100-fold. In contrast, FX had
essentially no effect on the transduction of HAdV5HVR7,
indicating effective inhibition of FX binding.
We further applied the adapter retargeting strategy34 to the FX-
ablated HAdV5HVR7. Depending on the retargeting module, the
virus could be retargeted to cancer cells such as A431, expressing
EGFR, or SKOV3.ip cells, expressing HER2 (Fig. 1c, d). Confocal
microscopy imaging of A431 cells infected with Alexa-Fluor 488-
labeled HAdV5wt indicated that virions with normal or adapter-
blocked fiber knobs bound inefficiently to these cells (Fig. 1e). In
contrast, an EGFR-retargeting adapter led to significant increase
of virion binding to cells. Importantly, the modification of the
viral entry mechanism by targeting a non-native receptor did not
ablate the cell entry and nuclear trafficking of the virus (Fig. 1f
and Supplementary Fig. 1). EGFR retargeting enhanced cell
binding and subsequently increased the number of internalized
particles, which in turn also resulted in higher transgene
expression (Fig. 1g). In conclusion, viral gene delivery by FX-
ablated HAdV5HVR7 to cancer cell lines can be strongly enhanced
with the fiber knob adapter strategy that targets tumor surface
biomarkers.
Retargeting improves gene delivery to xenograft tumors.
Having shown the potential of FX-ablated retargeted viruses
in vitro, we were interested in analyzing their behavior in vivo.
Today, most clinical trials of virotherapy have used direct intra-
tumoral delivery of the virion39, and thus we tested this approach
first. To gain insight into the retargeting of HAdV5HVR7 in vivo
we analyzed viral gene delivery in two subcutaneous xenograft
models in immunodeficient Rag1-/- mice (an immunodeficient
strain that lacks mature T and B lymphocytes)40, thereby testing
the performance of the DARPin adapter. Control experiments in
an A431 cell culture indicated that there the adapter is stable in
Rag1-/- mice serum, since preincubation of adapter in serum had
no significant impact on infection efficacy (Supplementary
Fig. 2a).
Upon intratumoral administration into A431 tumor xeno-
grafts, an EGFR-specific retargeting adapter increased the payload
delivery (luciferase) in the tumor by 20-fold, compared to
HAdV5HVR7 with a free fiber knob, and by 34-fold compared to a
blocked fiber knob virus (Fig. 2a). At the same time, the binding
of the adapter decreased liver targeting by approximately 37-fold
compared to the non-targeted HAdV5HVR7. In lung, spleen and
kidney, the luciferase signal was lower than in the liver, and the
signal was essentially at background levels in kidney and lung
when blocking the fiber knob. In the context of viral therapeutic
gene delivery, the ratio of expressed payload genes between tumor
and liver is of high relevance due to potential off-target side
effects of future payloads. In the A431 EGFR+ tumor model,
intratumoral application of HAdV5HVR7 thus led to a tumor-to-
liver ratio of 50, which was strongly increased to about 7200 by
EGFR targeting and inhibition of the CAR uptake pathway,
representing a 140-fold gain in specificity (Fig. 2b).
A HER2-overexpressing SKOV3.ip xenograft model in Rag1-/-
mice showed similar effects. Using the knob-binding adapters,
liver targeting was significantly reduced by up to 30-fold
(Supplementary Fig. 2b). With the HER2-specific retargeting
module, the payload delivery to the tumor was increased by
eightfold compared to the fiber knob-blocked virus upon
intratumoral virus injection. The signals in kidney and lung were
decreased by the adapters essentially to background levels. Also in
the HER2+ tumor model, the tumor-to-liver ratio of the delivered
viral payload of about 1200 was increased to about 24,600 by
HER2-retargeting and fiber knob blocking, a 20-fold change of
tumor selectivity (Fig. 2c). Thus, the application of a retargeting
and CAR pathway-blocking adapter in combination with FX-
ablated HAdV5HVR7 improved the localization upon intratu-
moral vector administration, being encouraging for future
therapeutic strategies.
EGFR retargeting enhances tumor cell-specific gene delivery.
Next, we evaluated the cellular specificity of viral gene delivery in
A431 tumor xenografts in more detail. Immunohistology for
luciferase transgene expression revealed that the untargeted
HAdV5HVR7 virus almost exclusively infects murine fibroblasts
or fibrocytes after intratumoral administration (Fig. 3). Only an
occasional luciferase-positive tumor cell was observed. The fiber
knob-blocked virus showed a similar result. In contrast, virus
with the EGFR-retargeting adapter resulted in luciferase expres-
sion in tumor cells, which were mainly observed as large patches.
Nonetheless, also the retargeted virus transduced fibroblasts in
the tumor-surrounding stroma. These results show that, even
after intratumoral injection, gene delivery with unmodified
HAdV5HVR7 is limited to murine stromal cells. The present data
reveal the necessity of a tumor-specific targeting adapter module
to infect the A431 tumor cells and demonstrate its functionality
in vivo. It is worth noting that only in the case of the unmodified
HAdV5HVR7, but not for the adapter-bound virions, luciferase-
positive hepatocytes could be detected in the liver (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3a). This is in accordance with the observed reduction of
liver targeting in the xenograft (Fig. 2a).
Adapter reduces liver tropism in systemic injections. Intratu-
moral administration of therapeutics has limited benefit for the
patient with disseminated tumors, as it is not applicable to poorly
accessible tumors. We thus explored systemic delivery of
HAdV5HVR7, where native particles are rapidly scavenged by the
liver41. We investigated the impact of the fiber knob-binding
adapters in EGFR+ (A431) and HER2+ (SKOV3.ip) subcutaneous
xenograft models with HAdV5HVR7 upon intravenous injection.
The retargeting adapter reduced the viral liver tropism around
70- and 20-fold in the A431 and SKOV3.ip xenograft models,
respectively (Fig. 4a, b). Similar results were obtained with viruses
containing the blocking adapter. This suggests that the knob is
playing an active role in liver tropism. Surprisingly, blocking of
the fiber knob with the adapter also strongly reduced off-targeting
to the kidney. In contrast, the signals in spleen and lung remained
unchanged. However, no increase in tumor targeting by the
retargeting adapter was detected after intravenous administration,
compared with the knob-blocking adapter, although the tumor-
to-liver ratio of payload expression was significantly increased by
a factor of around 170 in the EGFR+ tumor model and by 25-fold
in the HER2+ tumor model (Fig. 4c, d), compared to the naked
HAdV5HVR7.
Design of a capsid-binding shield based on a humanized scFv.
We next analyzed viral payload expression in different tumor cell
lines in the presence of the hexon-specific antibody 9C1235. As
expected, immunoglobulin G-mediated ADIN-based neutraliza-
tion prevented viral payload delivery in SKBR3, BT474 and
A431 cells, when cell entry occurred via an adapter targeting the
virion to EGFR or HER2 (Fig. 5a–c). To overcome these limita-
tions, and to protect the virion from undesired interactions with
host factors, we designed an artificial protein-based shield around
the hexon shell protein of the virion.
The construction of a humanized scFv provided the basic
module of the protein shield (Supplementary Fig. 4a). A CDR
(complementarity-determining region) graft from the murine
hexon-binding mAb 9C12 onto a human scFv framework led to a

 stable, monomeric scFv (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 4b)35,42.
To increase the affinity of the shielding scFv to multimers of
hexons as present in the virion capsid, we constructed a trimeric
scFv by fusing a highly stable trimerization domain, SHP of
lambdoid phage 2143, to the carboxy-terminus of the scFv
(Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). This strategy exploits the various
threefold symmetry axes present on the triangular faces of the
icosahedral shell. Trimerization led to an increase in affinity from
low nM of the monovalent scFv to 10 pM of the trivalent scFv to
immobilized hexons (Fig. 5e). In contrast to the monovalent scFv,
the trivalent scFv blocked binding of a bivalent mAb to both
purified hexon and virions (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). We
therefore conclude that the trivalent scFv provides a high-affinity
shield on the virion surface, most likely through avidity effects.
Shield covers virion by binding the domains of a hexon trimer.
To evaluate the arrangement of the shield on the icosahedral
capsid, the structure of the complex between HAdV5HVR7 and
the trimeric scFv shield was determined by single-particle cryo-
electron microscopy to a resolution of 7.4 Å (Supplementary
Fig. 6). A three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction revealed addi-
tional density all around the capsid (Fig. 6a). In the naked capsid,
the deep canyons between the inner capsid shell (red) and the
trimeric hexons (yellow and green) are clearly visible by applying
a color gradient indicating the distance to the center of the virion
(Fig. 6b). The shield expanded the diameter of the hybrid particle
by approximately 10 nm from 88 to 98 nm (Supplementary
Fig. 7a), thereby masking the icosahedral shape of the capsid and
yielding a rather spherical object.
To explore atomic details of the hybrid particle we also
determined the X-ray crystal structure of the scFv–hexon
complex
(Fig.
6c
and
Supplementary
Fig.
8). The
high-
resolution structure of the hexon and a 9C12 antibody fragment
unveiled the complex interaction network between the heavy and
the light chains of the scFv and different domains of a hexon
trimer, especially HVRs 2, 5 and 7. In order to assess possible
differences between the crystal and the in situ structure of the
scFv–hexon complex, we performed molecular dynamics flexible
fitting (MDFF) with the electron microscopy (EM) map of the
shielded capsid. During a 1 ns MDFF run we observed only a very
minor increase of the cross-correlation between map and

transgene signal in all analyzed organs other than kidney. Gene delivery to the liver was reduced by blocking the fiber knob with the adapter (blocked

 structure from an initial value of 0.87 to a plateau value 0.90. This
was mostly caused by a slight reorientation of the scFv on the
hexon that did not affect epitope binding (Supplementary Fig. 7b).
The high similarity between the two structures was also reflected
by a root-mean-square deviation of only 1.5 Å (Supplementary
Fig. 7c). This is further evidence for the validity of the structure of
the complex and underlines the high stability of the trimeric
shield and the hexon trimer.
To analyze the stoichiometry and the surface occupancy of the
shield on the viral capsid, we projected the complex structure
onto 6 asymmetric units (AUs) of one triangular facet of the
icosahedral capsid (Fig. 7a, b). Binding of the scFv is influenced
by the symmetrical arrangement of the neighboring hexons: each
icosahedral facet comprises 72 epitopes of mAb 9C12; at 42
epitopes, the scFvs bind without any clashes. Especially around
the threefold axes between hexons, the binding was sufficient for
the flexibly linked SHP to be resolved in the EM structure. At 18
epitopes two towers of neighboring hexons are facing each other,
resulting in a clash of the respective scFvs. At the 12 epitopes
around the pental vertex, the viral surface is slightly tilted, which
results in less clash volume. As a result, more additional shield
density was observed in the EM structure at these positions.
Shield keeps virus infectivity and inhibits neutralizing Abs. We
next investigated whether the artificial trimeric protein shield
prevented virus neutralization. A single-cell transduction analysis
of A549 cells using high-throughput microscopy showed an
efficient
reduction
in
the
infectivity
of
the
unshielded
HAdV5HVR7 when mAb 9C12 was added, consistent with the
reported ADIN16. This neutralization was significantly blocked by
the shield (Fig. 8a). We next analyzed the effect of the shield in
the context of the retargeting adapter. Single-cell transduction
analysis of SKOV3.ip cells with HER2-retargeted virus confirmed
the efficacy of the shield against antibody-mediated neutralization
(Fig. 8b). It has been shown that this ADIN-mediated viral
degradation is proteasome dependent16 for HAdV5wt using the
CAR pathway. Inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 in
HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 cells diminished ADIN-mediated
viral degradation, indicating proteasome dependency for HER2-
retargeted virions as well (Supplementary Fig. 9a)16. The retar-
geting of a shielded virus was further studied in a panel of
different tumor cell lines (Fig. 8c). The shielded virus efficiently
infected EGFR- and HER2-overexpressing cancer cells, demon-
strating again that the shield does not sterically interfere with
adapter-mediated receptor binding nor does it prevent virion
uptake. In A431 cells the payload expression was slightly reduced
upon shielding (Supplementary Fig. 9b). The analysis of cell
binding and entry with A488-labeled EGFR-retargeted virus
particles suggested a reduction in cell binding of the shielded
virions compared to the control virions in this instance (Sup-
plementary Fig. 9c, d). The underlying reasons are so far
unknown. Importantly, however, the antibody 9C12 did not affect
the payload expression from the shielded virus, in contrast to the
non-shielded virus (Supplementary Fig. 9b).
Next, we analyzed the effect of the shield against neutralizing
factors other than mAb 9C12. It has been described that
preexisting germline IgM antibodies were sufficient to activate
the complement cascade and hence inactivate viral particles,

tumors by immunohistology. Host fibroblasts are detected based on the expression of vimentin; luciferase staining reflects viral transgene expression. With
both free virus and fiber knob-blocked virus, mostly fibroblasts (arrowheads) express the transgene luciferase, both in the tumor and in the surrounding
stroma (asterisks). Luciferase-positive neoplastic cells (blue arrows) occur only rarely. In contrast, EGFR-retargeted virus is mainly found in viable tumor
cells (blue arrows), although stromal fibroblasts are also luciferase positive (arrowheads). Analysis of tumor sections was conducted in a blinded fashion,
and tumor cells were confirmed by their EGFR expression. Scale bar = 50 µm. The lower row provides an overview of the tumor after luciferase staining (N

indeed resulted in a significant decrease of infectivity to 45%,
compared
to
Ig-deficient
Rag1-/-
serum
in
case
of
the
HAdV5HVR7, which was recovered to 84% by the shield (Fig. 8d).
HAdV5 is a common human pathogen with a serum
prevalence of 95%44. We thus tested the ability of the shield to
block neutralization of HAdV5 by human sera. To assess the
impact of anti-hexon antibodies on virus transduction, we
depleted anti-hexon antibodies by competition with soluble
hexon
protein.
The
transduction
of
the
non-shielded
HAdV5HVR7 is reduced to 38% by human serum, compared to
the level after depletion of hexon binders. Strikingly, the
infectivity of the shielded virus was not reduced by the hexon
binders, indicating that immune-epitopes on the hexon were
sufficiently blocked by the shield (Fig. 8e).
Shield reduces viral gene delivery to liver and spleen. We then
studied the effect of the shield on viral biodistribution in an EGFR
and HER2 xenograft model in immunodeficient Rag1-/- mice. In
the subcutaneous SKOV3.ip xenograft, the combination of non-
targeted fiber knob blocking and shielding of the virus reduced
the gene delivery within the tumor by a factor of 10, compared to
unmodified HAdV5HVR7 upon intratumoral injection (Fig. 9a).
In contrast, the HER2-retargeting adapter significantly increased
the tumor-specific gene delivery of the shielded HAdV5HVR7 by
approximately 40-fold compared to the fiber knob-blocked
shielded virus, or 3-fold better than unmodified HAdV5HVR7.
Importantly, the shielding and fiber knob blocking, indepen-
dent of the retargeting DARPin, significantly reduced off-
targeting to all other tissues to background levels. The increased
gene delivery within the tumor and strong reduction in liver off-
targeting led to an improved tumor-to-liver ratio of 1.1 million
for the HER2-retargeted, shielded virus compared to a ratio of
1300
for
the
unmodified
HAdV5HVR7
upon
intratumoral
injection (Fig. 9b), and thus about a 1000-fold improvement.
Similar results were achieved in the EGFR-positive subcuta-
neous A431 xenograft model after intratumoral administration.
The combination of shielding and EGFR retargeting resulted in a
fivefold increased gene delivery to the tumor (Fig. 9c). At the

Fig. 4 Adapter reduces off-targeting and increases tumor–liver ratio after intravenous (IV) injection. a, b 3 × 106 HAdV5HVR7 particles were injected in the
tail vein of Rag1-/-mice, bearing either EGFR- or HER2-overexpressing subcutaneous tumors. Gene delivery was analyzed 48 hpi by luciferase activity,
normalized to total protein amount. a More than 99% of the transgene activity was located in the liver after IV application of the virus alone. The blocking
of the fiber knob by either adapter significantly decreased the gene delivery to liver, kidney and lung. Either knob-binding adapter increased the gene
delivery to the tumor and the spleen. Background signals from control injections with PBS are indicated by dashed lines (each symbol represents one organ,
n=5, two-way ANOVA of log-transformed data, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). b Intravenous injection of blocked, non-targeted
HAdV5HVR7, and HER2-targeted HAdV5HVR7 resulted in strong reduction of liver and kidney transduction. A HER2 adapter-mediated targeting of the
tumor was absent, since the luciferase activity was not higher than for the blocked virus. Background signals from control injections with PBS are indicated

 same time, the off-targeting to the liver and spleen was reduced
through the shield by a factor of 260 and 6, respectively. While
direct application of HAdV5HVR7 to the subcutaneous tumor led
to a tumor-to-liver ratio of 300 of the transgene signal, the
shielded EGFR-retargeted HAdV5HVR7 resulted in 9200 times
higher payload activity in the tumor, in both cases upon
intratumoral injection (Fig. 9d). Immunohistology confirmed
that the shielded and retargeted HAdV5HVR7 infects tumor cells
in a similar manner to the unshielded, retargeted virion
(Supplementary Fig. 3b and Fig. 3).
After intravenous application into tumor-bearing Rag1-/- mice,
we could confirm the very strong liver tropism of HAdV5HVR7
virus
(Fig.
9e).
Strikingly,
a
shielded,
EGFR-retargeted
HAdV5HVR7 showed a robust reduction in liver off-targeting by
a factor of approximately 14,000. While also the tumor targeting
was reduced (×5), the off-targeting to spleen (×11), kidney (×307)
and lung (×26) was more strongly decreased. The liver scavenging
resulted in a tumor-to-liver ratio of 0.001 for unshielded
HAdV5HVR7 (Fig. 9f). However, the shielded and EGFR-
retargeted virus showed a tumor-to-liver ratio of about 3,
constituting an increase by a factor of more than 2500 (Fig. 9e,
f). Similar effects were observed in the HER2 xenograft model
upon intravenous administration (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b).
Here, the liver targeting was massively decreased upon retargeting
and shielding, which led to a tumor-to-liver ratio of 2, a 300-fold
improvement
compared
to
untargeted
and
unshielded
HAdV5HVR7.
Discussion
Although recent progress in gene therapy clinical trials proved the
non-toxicity of adenoviral vectors45–47, off-targeting, especially
liver sequestration11, as well as immune clearance are still major
problems for the application of HAdVs. A tumor-to-liver ratio of
the delivered viral transgene of only 0.001 illustrates this issue
(Figs. 4d and 9f and Supplementary Fig. 10b). Consequently, the
primary goal for the future development of such therapies has to

 be a profound liver detargeting to enable the systemic delivery of
tumor-targeted HAdV5 vectors, including a specific targeting of
the desired cells.
We have developed a viral gene vector with two independent
modules, a retargeting adapter34 and a scFv shield (reported
here), to improve gene delivery to selected tissues (e.g., tumors)
in vivo and to reduce liver off-targeting and protect the viral
vector from immune neutralization (Fig. 10). Importantly, shield
and adapter are separate proteins and can thus be added to virus
carrying any payload, without having to reengineer the virus
itself.
HAdV5 binds FX, and its interactions make the virus hepa-
totropic36 and activate innate immunity as a PAMP22, having
motivated the removal of the FX-binding site from the hexon37. It
has emerged, however, that in the absence of FX HAdV5 remains
hepatotropic19. Recently, HVRs 1, 2, 5 and 7 have been identified
to interact with the Kupffer cell scavenger receptor SRA-II48.
These observations motivate the creation of a reversible shield
around the virion that does not hinder infection nor lead itself to
nonspecific binding.
So far, mainly polymeric shielding approaches based on
unspecific electrostatic interactions with the virus shell have been
reported49,50. Covalent coupling of polymers has been attempted
as well but found to interfere with intracellular trafficking and
uncoating of the capsid51,52, which are key to infection53. Even if
such problems can be solved, the existence of antibodies against
polymers like PEG, as recently discussed54, might represent
another challenge for polymer shields. Another strategy can be
protein shields, but so far their affinities were either too weak and
could be outcompeted by endogenous proteins25 or too strong
and they then impaired viral infection55. Therefore, we designed a
stable, high-affinity multivalent protein shield which binds with

 an affinity of 10 pM (Fig. 5) and could not be outcompeted by,
e.g., the blood-borne FX25. Despite this high affinity, we show
that the shield does not influence the viral transduction efficiency
in vitro (Fig. 8a–b) and in vivo (Fig. 9a–c).
We indeed found that our hexon-specific shield reduced gene
delivery to the liver (Fig. 9). Our high-resolution EM and crystal
structures reveal that the scFv shield binds to HVRs 2, 5 and 7 of
the hexon and, through multimerization, masks the other HVRs,
thereby probably blocking the access of scavenger receptors,
which are highly expressed on macrophages, present also in lung
and spleen. Accordingly, we also observed a reduced viral
transgene expression in these organs (Fig. 9a, c, e). The shield
might also block a soluble blood factor that binds to the virion
and retargets the particle to CAR-expressing tissue. Recently, the
presence of such a factor has been described, but not identified, in
murine Rag2-/- serum56. In conclusion, the combination of
retargeting and shielding improved the tumor-to-liver ratio upon
intratumoral injection from 300 to 7200 for the EGFR+ and from
1300 to 1,100,000 for the HER2+ xenograft.
Upon systemic administration, the shield and the adapter
(providing binding sites for the tumor surface antigens) reduced
liver targeting by 14,000-fold (Fig. 9e). However, the virions were
not preferentially targeted to the tumor (fivefold reduction),
despite showing a gain in specificity and efficacy of tumor tar-
geting upon intratumoral injection (Figs. 3 and 9c). This absence
of increase in tumor targeting (Fig. 4) is consistent with a model
developed by Wittrup and colleagues57, which suggests that for
large particles like nanoparticles or viruses, tumor antigen bind-
ing will not significantly increase the uptake into the tumor
compared to non-targeted particles. In fact, extravasation of large
particles is difficult to achieve, as it depends on the fenestration of
the tumor, and is limited given by the large size of the viral
particles.
We also observed an overall loss of payload signal from the
shielded and retargeted virus in all other analyzed organs,
including kidney, spleen and lung, upon systemic application, a
finding which would be advantageous for tumor applications. At
this point, we do not know whether this is due to a decrease of
uptake and degradation of the virions in these tissues, or, in cells
outside of these tissues, for example, fibroblasts and endothelial
cells. Nevertheless, upon intravenous injection, the shield in
combination with the adapter increased the tumor-to-liver ratio
for the EGFR+ tumor model by a factor of 2500, and for the
HER2+ tumor model 300-fold compared to HAdV5HVR7 alone,
in both cases resulting in a tumor-to-liver ratio of >2. Future
developments will focus on increasing accessibility of the virions
to the tumor.
We further analyzed the influence of the shield on neu-
tralization by the immune system. HAdV5 is well controlled by
the immune system, being inactivated by the innate19 and the
adaptive immune system16. Here we show that our shield protects
the virion from intracellular degradation induced by a mono-
clonal antibody. The shield also protects from complement-
mediated clearance as well as from other, less characterized,
hexon-specific neutralization factors in human blood (Fig. 8).
Consistently, the hexon has been reported to be the major target
of neutralizing antibodies58,59, often directed against highly
repetitive and charged structures that are, e.g., present in HVRs
1–3 of the hexon21,60. The structure of the shielded virion illus-
trates an extensive coverage of the viral surface, consistent with
extensive protection from the immune system (Figs. 6 and 7).
Notably, our structure of the Ab-hexon complex also explains the
recent finding of an ADIN-escape mutant of HAdV5, carrying
the single mutation G443D, selected by directed evolution61. We
speculate that the insertion of a negative charge in the hexon,
facing a cluster of negative charges (Asp32, Asp58 and Asp91) in
the light chain of the antibody (Supplementary Fig. 7d), intro-
duces charge repulsions and steric clashes and thus reduces
binding of the antibody. To circumvent the high seroprevalence
of anti-HAdV5 antibodies, further genetic alterations such as
fiber shaft swapping or mutations in the penton base might be
envisaged.
Our approach here combines several levels of engineering of
different components and improves existing Ad5 vectors. Our
strategy to generate mosaic virions is applicable to other serotypes
with different features12,47. For example, it might be possible to
swap the residues in HVRs 2, 5 and 758 forming the scFv epitope
onto capsids of other serotypes or chimeric adenoviruses and
thereby extend the usage of the available HAdV5 shield.
While the targeting adaptors do not improve net virus locali-
zation to the tumor after systemic treatment, they profoundly
enhance target-mediated viral infection of the respective cells,
demonstrating functionality of the modular adapters in vivo. The
adapter is stable in murine serum, an essential feature for in vivo
applications. Besides providing new cell surface receptor specifi-
city, the knob-binding part covers a large surface on the fiber
knob, and masks the CAR binding site. Similar to others62,63, we
observed, upon systemic administration, a fiber knob-mediated
liver tropism which is reduced by the adapter by approximately
60-fold. This is not dependent on the retargeting moiety per se,
but seems to be due to precluding virion binding to CAR.
Interestingly, viral targeting to the kidney was also significantly

according to the crystal structure. At the threefold symmetry axes between
neighboring hexons, a complete trivalent scFv-SHP could bind. The
projection of the structure predicted a clash if the tower of two neighboring
hexons face each other (orange scFvs or circles). At the vertices close to
the penton, the surface is bent, which results in only a minor clash (red

0.05). For each condition, around 3000 cells were analyzed. c Antibody-dependent neutralization of HAdV5HVR7 can be blocked by the trivalent shield as
shown by infection assays in A431 (EGFR targeting), SKOV3.ip (HER2-targeting), or BT474 (HER2-targeting) cells (mean ± SD, two-sided, unpaired
Welch’s t-test, n=2-3, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). d Incubation of virus with wt mouse serum reduced viral gene delivery to 45% compared to Rag1-/- serum
(set to 100%), while the shielded virus was only slightly affected by the wt serum (84%) (mean normalized to Rag1-/- ctrl ± SD, two-way ANOVA of
normalized data with post hoc Bonferoni, n = 4, *P < 0.05, ****P < 0.0001). e Analysis of whether neutralization by human serum is due to hexon-specific
antibodies. Transduction was performed with or without soluble hexon as competitor for such antibodies; presence of 0.88 µM hexon was set to 100%.
Unshielded HAdV5HVR7 is neutralized by human serum in the presence of hexon binders, i.e., when they are not removed, but the transduction of the
shielded virus is similar in the presence or absence of hexon-specific binders in human serum (mean normalized to hexon-depleted condition ± SD, two-
way ANOVA of normalized data, n = 4, **P < 0.01)

 reduced by the knob adapters. So far, the influence of CAR–fiber
knob interaction on the liver tropism had only been analyzed in
the presence of FX, which in itself contributes to liver tropism36.
Because of FX protection against neutralization by the innate
immune system19,64, biodistribution of FX binding-ablated virus
particles is best studied in immunodeficient animals.
The generic design of the adapter34 allows for the retargeting of
virions to various cell surface receptors, as exemplified by HER2
or EGFR in the present study. After intratumoral administration,
the tumor-specific viral transgene expression was enhanced
through virus retargeting in both HER2+ and EGFR+ xenograft
models by 20- to 34-fold. The retargeting improves the tumor-to-
liver ratio from 51 to 7200 and from 1000 to 10,000 for both the
EGFR+ and HER2+ xenograft, respectively, after intratumoral
injection. Our cell-specific analysis of gene delivery to the tumor
yielded several remarkable findings. First, EGFR retargeting is
indispensable to achieve tumor-specific gene delivery in the
A431 subcutaneous xenograft, demonstrating the functionality of
the adapter. Second, all viruses, independent of retargeting or not,
infected murine cells, i.e., fibroblasts in the tumor stroma. We

Fig. 9 Shielding with retargeting reduces off-targeting and increases tumor–liver ratio. a 1.5 × 106 HAdV5HVR7 particles were injected into subcutaneous
HER2+ SKOV3.ip tumors in Rag1-/- mice. Gene delivery was analyzed 48 hpi by luciferase activity, normalized to total protein amount. Fiber knob blocking
of a shielded virus reduces viral gene delivery to the tumor only slightly compared to virus with free knob. In contrast, HER2 retargeting significantly
increases gene delivery within the tumor by a factor of around 40 compared to the fiber knob-blocked virus. Shielding in combination with a blocked fiber
knob significantly reduces gene delivery to the liver and all other organs, compared to non-modified virus. Presented data are representative for two
independent experiments. b Shielding and retargeting significantly increases the tumor-to-liver ratio of gene delivery from ca. 1300 to ca. 1.1-million-fold, an
improvement by a factor of ca. 900. Tumor-to-liver ratios of individual mice from two independent experiments are presented. c Retargeting of a shielded
virus increased viral gene delivery to the tumor after intratumoral injection in A431 xenografts. In addition, off-targeting to liver and spleen was reduced. d
The ratio of transgene activity between tumor and liver was increased from 300 for the unmodified virus to 9200 for the retargeted and shielded virus.
Tumor-to-liver ratios of individual mice from two independent experiments are presented. e Intravenous delivery: in comparison to unmodified virus,
shielding of an EGFR-targeted virus decreased the gene delivery to the tumor slightly upon intravenous virus injection, but drastically reduced off-targeting
to all organs analyzed. f Systemic biodistribution was changed by the shield. The tumor–liver ratio in the A431 xenograft was increased by more than 2500-
fold (each symbol represents (a, c, e) one organ analyzed with two-way ANOVA of log-transformed data or (b, d, f) the ratio of an individual with two-

 speculate that motifs like the RGD loop in the penton base might
play a role, as fibroblasts have been reported to have low CAR but
high levels of integrins65.
In summary, we describe a proof of principle for a new viral
vector using a multidisciplinary approach, combining genetic
virus engineering, protein design, cryo-EM, protein crystal-
lography and in vitro and in vivo tumor models to construct a
‘stealth’ tumor-targeting adenovirus, resulting in the first high-
affinity yet reversible serum-stable shield described in molecular
detail. We improved the protection of the HAdV5HVR7 gene
delivery vector against immune neutralization and thus improved
the tumor–liver ratio of the viral payload. The reduction in viral
off-targeting and improved specificity of the payload expression
in tumor cells will enable novel concepts for gene delivery of
secreted cancer therapeutics with non-replicative viral vectors,
which do not rely on transduction of each and every neoplastic
cell. Since engineered virions with any payload can be complexed
with our shielding and retargeting modules, further engineering
can be envisioned to extend the versatility of this modular system.
Methods
Virus and cell lines. The human ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3.ip was kindly
provided by Ellen Vitetta, University of Texas, Dallas, TX. All other cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; www.atcc.org) and
have been verified to be free of mycoplasma contaminations. Two different viruses
were used in this project. The replication-deficient HAdV5_ΔE1_GFP, an E1/E3
deletion mutant virus containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)
gene in the E1 region under the control of the cytomegalovirus major immediate
early promoter, was grown in human embryonic retinoblast (HER)-911 cells66. The
replication-deficient HAdV5HVR7 is derived from the AdEasy system (Agilent) and
contains 4 mutations in the HVR7 (I421G, T423N, E424S and L426Y). The virus
was produced in HEK293 cells. Both viruses were purified by a two-step CsCl
gradient ultracentrifugation. The antibody 9C12 was obtained from Developmental
Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and maintained by the Uni-
versity of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, IA.
Purification of retargeting adapters. The DARPin adapters were expressed and
purified in Escherichia coli BL2134. The trivalent adapters were cloned into pQIq
vectors containing a N-terminal 3C-cleavable His10-tag in E. coli XL1 Blue, purified
using immobilized-metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) with subsequent
cleavage of the His-tag. Additional purification steps included anion exchange
chromatography using a MonoQ column (GE Healthcare) and size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg (GE Healthcare).
Analysis of viral gene delivery. The retargeting complex was formed by addition
of purified adapter in a ratio of 2:1 per virus fiber knob if not stated otherwise. For
the shielding, the complex was formed with a 5:1 ratio of trivalent scFv/hexon
trimer. The complexes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature (RT). Two
different viruses encoding virally encoded reporters, either luciferase or GFP, were
used for virus infection assays (see above). 8 × 103 cells were seeded in a 96-well
plate 1 day before transduction. For single-cell analysis, expression of the viral
transgene GFP upon viral gene delivery was measured by high-throughput
microscopy 24 h post infection (hpi) using 8.75 ng virus per well. The cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100
and stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)32. DAPI staining was used
to mark the cell nucleus, and a custom-made script (Matlab; Mathworks, USA) or a
custom-made CellProfiler (version 2.0) pipeline was used to quantify the average
nuclear intensity of GFP, and these served as measures of infection efficacy. The
raw images, MatLab and CellProfiler routines used in this study will be made
available upon request. For luciferase assays, cells were transduced with virus at a
concentration of 1000 VP per cell for 4 h until the virus was washed away and
replaced with fresh medium. For analysis of viral transgene expression, luciferase
activity was determined 48 h post transduction from cell lysate (Luciferase assay
system, Promega). For retargeting and shielding, a complex of the adapter and the
shield with the virus was formed by mixing the components followed by 2 h of
incubation at RT. For the neutralization assays with antibody 9C12, virus was
mixed with the antibody (100 ng per mL if not stated otherwise) directly in the
well. For complement neutralization, fresh serum from Rag1-/- or naive C57BL/6
was obtained and mixed with the virus (2 × 108 VP per10 µL serum) and incubated
at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the mixture was diluted in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and added to the cells.
For neutralization with human serum (Invitrogen), hexon-specific binders were
competed by preincubation with hexon (8.8 pmol hexon per 10 µL human serum)
at RT for 1 h. All neutralization assays were analyzed as described above for
transgene delivery with the retargeting adapters.
For the confocal analysis of cell binding and internalization, cells were seeded
on Alcian blue-coated glass coverslips in 24-well dishes (40,000 cells per well) and
grown for 2 days. NHS-Alexa-Fluor 488-labeled viruses67 (0.23 µg of virus per well,
yielding about 10 to 300 bound particles per cell) were bound to cells on ice for 60
min in RPMI-1640 medium (without NaHCO3; Sigma) supplemented with 20 mM
HEPES and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (RPMI-BSA medium). The
unbound virus was washed away. For the cell binding analysis, cells were fixed with
4% PFA (pH 7.4), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and DAPI stained. Viral
internalization was performed by addition of DMEM medium prewarmed to 37 °C
and containing 10% FCS. After 1 h at 37 °C, cells were fixed and stained as
described above. The samples were imaged with a Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning
microscope using a 63× objective (oil immersion; numerical aperture 1.4) and
zoom factor 2. Excitations were at 405 nm (DAPI) and 488 nm (Alexa-Fluor-

Fig. 10 Overview of subsequent modifications for the generation of a new gene vector. Depicted are subsequent steps of engineering. Based on a wild-type
HAdV5, which binds FX and e.g. upon intravenous administration this leads to very strong liver tropism. The viral capsid was genetically engineered to
ablate the FX interaction. A retargeting adapter allows specific transduction of cancer cells via cell surface markers such as EGFR or HER2. Without the FX
coat, the viral capsid can easily be destroyed by the immune system, e.g., by ADIN. We generated a novel artificial shield based on hexon-binding proteins
and the viral capsid symmetry determined by EM and crystal structures. The retargeted shielded virus was tested for neutralization, e.g., by ADIN, and for
increased gene delivery to the tumor compared to the liver, described as the tumor-to-liver ratio, in both EGFR- and HER2-overexpressing in vivo tumor
models

 labeled virus). Stacks were recorded at 0.5 µm intervals using 4× averaging and
sequential acquisition for the individual channels. Representative images shown in
figures represent maximum projections of confocal stacks and were processed with
ImageJ, applying the same changes in brightness and contrast to all image groups
in the series (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). All conditions, EGFR retargeting and
shielding with retargeting were performed together. For the comparison with the
shielded virus, the EGFR targeting of the labeled virus is reused in Supplementary
Figure 9.
In vivo biodistribution of viral transgene. Rag1-/- mice were kindly provided by
Professor Manfred Kopf, ETH Zürich. The mice were free of all viral, bacterial, and
parasitic pathogens listed in the Federation of European Laboratory Animal
Associations (FELASA) recommendations. Animals were housed in type III plastic
cages (425 × 266 × 150 mm, floor area 820 cm2) with autoclaved dust-free wooden
bedding (80–90 g/cage) (Schill AG, Muttenz, Switzerland) and autoclaved paper
tissues (2/cage) and a paper house as nesting material. They were fed a pelleted
mouse diet (Kliba No. 3431, Provimi Kliba, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) ad libitum
and had unrestricted access to sterilized drinking water. The light/dark cycle in the
room consisted of 12/12 h with artificial light (40 Lux in the cage) from 0700 to
1900 h. The room temperature was 21 ± 1 °C, with a relative humidity of 50±5%
and with 15 complete changes of filtered air per hour (HEPA H 14 filter, Vokes-
Air, Uster, Switzerland); the air pressure was controlled at 50 Pa. The studies were
approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office (Zurich, Switzerland). Housing and
experimental procedures were in accordance with the Swiss animal protection law
and conformed to the European Convention for the protection of vertebrate ani-
mals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (Council of Europe no.
123 Strasbourg 1985).
During all in vivo experiments, the experimenter was blinded in regard to the
applied treatments. Sample size was determined using G*Power (α: 0.05, β: 0.8)
after a pilot experiment. For the xenograft models, 3–6 × 106 tumor cells (SKOV3.
ip or A431) were subcutaneously inoculated in 6–8-week-old Rag1-/- mice. After
tumor establishment (approximately 35 days), all mice were grouped in a stratified
randomization based on average tumor size. Luciferase-encoding HAdV5HVR7
virus particles were injected (for intratumoral administration, 1.5 × 1010 VP in 50
µL PBS, for intravenous injection 3 × 1010 VP in 100 µL phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS)). For retargeted as well as shielded viruses, a complex of virus, retargeting
adapter and shield was formed by mixing the components followed by 2 h of
incubation at RT as described above. Mice were killed 48 h post injection by CO2
and dissected immediately after death. Organs and tumors were harvested. One
half of the tumor and left liver lobe as well as the spleen, the left kidney, and the
lung were used to measure transgene activity. Luciferase activity was determined
from smashed organ samples and normalized to total protein using BCA protein
assays. The remaining half of the tumor with surrounding tissue and half of the left
liver lobe were fixed in 4% PFA (pH 7.4). According to the 3R principle, the
number of mice was kept at a minimum and the retargeting as well as the shielding
analysis in vivo was done in parallel. Therefore, both are compared to the same
mice which received only HAdV5HVR7.
After 24 to 48 h of PFA fixation, the tumor tissue and liver lobe were trimmed
and routinely embedded in paraffin wax for histological and immunohistological
examinations. Consecutive sections (3–5 µm) were prepared and stained with
hematoxylin–eosin or subjected to immunohistology for the demonstration of
luciferase, Her2, EGFR, and vimentin (marker of mesenchymal cells). Briefly, after
deparaffination, sections underwent an antigen retrieval procedure, achieved by
incubation at 98 °C for 20 min in EDTA buffer (pH 9.0; for luciferase) or in citrate
buffer (pH 6.0; for HER2, EGFR, and vimentin). This was followed by incubation
with the primary antibodies, mouse anti-firefly luciferase (clone Luci17; Abcam;
dilution: 1:100) and mouse anti-vimentin (clone Vim 2B4; Dako; dilution: 1:300)
for 1 h at RT; rabbit monoclonal anti-EGFR and rabbit anti-HER2 (clone D38B1
(EGFR); dilution: 1:50 and 29B8 (HER2); dilution: 1:400; Cell Signaling) for 15–18
h at 4 °C, blocking of endogenous peroxidase (peroxidase blocking buffer; Dako)
for 10 min at RT, and incubation with the detection system (Envision System HPR
Mouse and Rabbit, respectively (for luciferase, HER2 and EGFR); DAKO) for 30
min at RT or streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (Dako Real; Dako), with
diaminobenzidine as chromogen and counterstaining with hematoxylin.
Humanization of scFv by CDR grafting. For the CDR grafting of mAb 9C1235
onto a stable human framework, the closest germline family was determined42.
Subsequently, additional stabilizing mutations were introduced (Supplementary
Fig. 4a, b). The resulting scFv was expressed in a modified pFL vectors (Geneva
Biotech, Switzerland) behind a polyhedrin promoter and a mellitin signal sequence
containing a 3C-cleavable His10-tag at the C terminus in insect cells using the
MultiBAC system68. For the trivalent shield, the scFv was fused to one SHP sub-
unit43 using flexible glycine–serine linkers (Supplementary Fig. 4c and d). The scFv
was purified by IMAC with subsequent cleavage of the His-tag by 3C protease.
Further purification steps included cation-exchange chromatography using a
MonoS column (GE Healthcare) and SEC using a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare).
Affinity measurements based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR
measurements were performed on a ProteOn XPR36 instrument (BioRad). Hexon
protein was purified from HAdV5HVR7-infected HEK293 cells with AIEX using
DEAE and MonoQ columns (GE Healthcare)69 and biotinylated using NHS-biotin
(Pierce). The biotinylated hexon was immobilized on a NeutrAvidin NLC sensor
chip (BioRad) until 799 resonance units were reached. Purified scFcs (1 to 32 nM)
were injected at a flow rate of 60 μL/min for 240 s. Dissociation was followed over
at least 600 s. Simple Langmuir kinetic fitting was applied where appropriate (see
Results) with the ProteOn Manager software, otherwise a heterogeneous ligand
model was used.
Crystallization and data collection. For the structural analysis of the scFv binding
to the hexon, purified hexon (from HAdV5HVR7-infected HEK293 cells, using IEX
as described above69) was mixed with a threefold molar excess of scFv (VL-(G4S)3-
VH) purified as described above, and the complex was purified by SEC in HEPES
buffered saline buffer (1 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl). The complex was
concentrated to 7.5 mg/mL and sparse matrix screens from Hampton Research
(Hampton Research, California, USA) and Molecular Dimensions (Molecular
Dimensions, Suffolk, UK) were set up to screen for suitable crystallization condi-
tions. Further details about data collection, structure determination and refinement
are described in the Supplementary Methods. X-ray data collection and refinement
statistics are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Single-particle cryo-EM. Vitrified specimens were prepared by pipetting 4 µL of
sample on glow-discharged 400 mesh holey carbon R2/1 EM grids (Quantifoil,
Jena, Germany) followed by manual plunge-freezing in liquid ethane with blotting
times between 1 and 3 s. Image data were recorded using a FEI Titan Krios
transmission electron microscope equipped with a Quantum energy filter and a
K2-Summit direct electron detector (Gatan, Pleasanton, USA). Further information
about the data collection, 3D refinement, and molecular dynamics are described in
the Supplement and in Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (La
Jolla, CA, USA). All data are expressed as means±standard deviation unless
indicated otherwise. The statistical analysis for two-group comparisons was per-
formed with Welch’s t-test for normally distributed samples with unequal variance.
Multiple sample comparisons were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by post hoc Tukey's test if not stated otherwise. Significance was estab-
lished at the P ≤ 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 levels, as indicated in the figures.
