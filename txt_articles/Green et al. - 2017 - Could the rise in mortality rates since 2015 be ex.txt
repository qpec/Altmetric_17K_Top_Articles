background 2015 saw the largest annual spike 
of mortality rates in England in almost 50 years. We 
examine whether these changes in mortality rates are 
associated with an indicator of poor functioning of 
health and social care: delay in hospital discharges.
Methods Office for National Statistics monthly data of 
death counts and mortality rates for the period August 
2010–March 2016 were compared with delays in 
discharges from National Health Service (NHS) England 
data on transfers of care for acute and non-acute 
patients in England. Autoregressive Integrated Moving 
Average regression models were used in the analysis.
results We estimate that each additional day an acute 
admission was late being discharged was associated 
with an increase in 0.394 deaths (95% CIs 0.220 to 
0.569). For each additional acute patient delayed being 
discharged, we found an increase of 7.322 deaths (95% 
CIs 1.754 to 12.890). Findings for non-acute admissions 
were mixed.
conclusion The increased prevalence of patients 
being delayed in discharge from hospital in 2015 was 
associated with increases in mortality, accounting for 
up to a fifth of mortality increases. Our study provides 
evidence that a lower quality of performance of the NHS 
and adult social care as a result of austerity may be 
having an adverse impact on population health.
IntroductIon
The period July 2014 to June 2015 saw an addi-
tional 39 
074 deaths in England and Wales compared 
with the same period the previous year.1 While 
mortality rates fluctuate year-on-year, this was 
the largest rise for nearly 50 years and the higher 
rate of mortality has been maintained throughout 
2016 and into 2017.2 These recent trends contrast 
with the long-term decline in age-specific mortality 
rates throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.3 The 
majority of these additional deaths were in frail 
elderly individuals.1 4
The increase in mortality rates has occurred 
during a crisis in the National Health Service (NHS). 
The number of NHS trusts with budget deficits has 
increased sharply since 2014/2015,5 as did waiting 
periods for elective surgery in 2015.6 Issues within 
the NHS are being compounded by problems with 
the provision of adult social care to support individ-
uals leaving NHS care7 and pressures of increased 
demand.8
We examine whether increases in the number of 
individuals who are delayed being discharged from 
hospital are associated with changes in the number 
of deaths. Delayed discharges may signal worsening 
health and social care and influence mortality rates 
through delaying transfer to appropriate care and/
or preventing new patients from accessing appro-
priate care.
Methodology
Using data on monthly number of deaths,2 we 
calculated mortality rates. Monthly population 
counts are not produced so we used midyear popu-
lation estimates for England.9 Official estimates are 
produced for the total population count on 31 June 
and were available up to mid-2015 at the time of 
analysis. We then used population projection esti-
mates for periods outside of this period pro rata 
for month.10 While mortality rates are our primary 
outcome, we also test the monthly number of 
deaths since our population data are estimates and 
may introduce bias into our results.
The monthly number of delayed transfers of care 
was used as our explanatory variable.11 A delayed 
transfer of care was defined as where an admitted 
patient was ready to be discharged from the care 
they were receiving but was still occupying a bed. 
T
wo measures were available: the total number 
of patients (defined as the number of patients 
currently identified as being delayed on the last 
Thursday of each month) and the total number of 
cumulative days per month patients were delayed. 
Delayed discharges were also split by acute and 
non-acute admissions to account for patient mix in 
severity. We used data for the months August 2010 
to March 2016 (n=68), the latest available at the 
time of analysis.
Due to the time-series nature of the data, we 
use an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average 
(ARIMA) regression model to examine the number 
of deaths for each month. ARIMA models account 
for the temporal interdependence of observations 
using a series of lagged variables of the outcome 
variable (ie, 1 
month’s observations are predictive 
of the following month) and error terms (observa-
tions are non-independent). ARIMA thus provides 
a fairer estimation of the association of mortality 
rates to our exposures. Models were selected 
based on the ‘ 
auto. 
arima’ R function, which selects 
the model that best fits the data.12 We included 
a seasonal element in the model to account for 
the fact that mortality rates are highest in winter 
and lowest in summer. The model selected was: 
ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,1,0)12 with drift.
Research report
Could the rise in mortality rates since 2015 be 
explained by changes in the number of delayed 
discharges of NHS patients?

results
From 2011, there is an upward trend in the total number of days 
acute patients experienced delays in their discharges, although 
not for the total number of acute patients (figure 1). The rate of 
this increase appears to change in 2014, where both measures 
begin to trend upwards. The trend for non-acute admissions 
differs with a ‘u’-shaped trend of declines up to 2014 and 
increases therein after for both measures.
Table 1 presents the results from four separate regression 
models. Model A uses the total number of deaths within a month 
as the outcome variable and examines the total number of days 
cumulatively patients were late being discharged. We find a posi-
tive association with the total number of days delayed that were 
acute admissions. For each additional day an acute admission 
was late being discharged, we estimate that the number of deaths 
increased by 0.394 (95% CIs 0.220 to 0.569). We also detect a 
negative association for non-acute admissions.
Model B repeats the same analysis with a different exposure: 
the total number of patients who were late being discharged. 
The results show similar trends to those reported in model A but 
with greater uncertainty. Each one unit increase in the number of 
acute patients who were delayed being discharged was associated 
with an increase in the total number of deaths of 7.322 (95% 
CIs 1.754 to 12.890). For non-acute admissions, we also find a 
negative association.
Models C and D repeat the same analyses presented in models 
A and B but with mortality rate used as the outcome variable. 
Both models (C and D) demonstrate positive associations for 
acute admissions. While the associations for non-acute admis-
sions were also negative, the 95% CIs cross a value of 0 and 
hence were non-significant.
dIscussIon
Our analysis shows that changes in the numbers of delayed 
discharges were associated with changes in mortality trends for 
England. Delays in the discharge of acute patients were consis-
tently positively associated with a higher monthly number of 
deaths and overall mortality rates across each of our models; 
associations for non-acute delayed discharges were mixed. We 
interpret the model coefficients to suggest that around one-fifth 
of the observed increase in mortality between 2014 and 2015 
could be due to changes in the numbers of acute patients delayed 
being discharged.
We hypothesise two possible mechanisms through which delayed 
discharges may lead to increases in mortality rates: First, patients 
who are delayed being discharged may be postponed in accessing 
the correct type of care. Delays may also result in stress and anxiety 
among individuals who wish to be discharged. One criticism of 
this hypothesis is that individuals are still receiving care, although

this does not account for the wider context of cuts to services that 
may limit quality of care. Longer stays within hospital may expose 
patients to inadequate care, although they may equally delay expo-
sure to inadequate social care due to cut backs.
Second, delays in discharging patients out of hospital may 
have knock-on effects on individuals outside of hospitals. A lack 
of available beds in hospitals due to blockages in discharging 
patients will harm those who have yet to be admitted and are in 
need of medical care. Given that we observe a stronger associ-
ation for discharge delays among acute patients compared with 
non-acute patients, the hypothesis appears plausible since acute 
patients are likely to require urgent care.
These explanations are unlikely to completely account for 
the rise in mortality rates, and delayed discharges could be a 
symptom of the broader funding crises in the NHS and adult 
social care,5 7 which have resulted in cutbacks to: the availability 
and quality of service provision including; declining ambulance 
response times,13 increased general practitioner workloads14 and 
increased waiting times.6 15 16 Such issues may have begun to 
have a knock-on effect on population health.
Alternative explanations for the rise in mortality rates include: 
the effects of an ageing population, influenza and random fluc-
tuations. None of these explanations appear to fully explain 
trends in mortality.1 15 It is also plausible that the wider context 
of austerity has created conditions for enabling or compounding 
their impacts. For example, having a large population share of 
elderly people may put greater pressure on health and social 
care, but issues will only arise if these services are underfunded 
or operate inefficiently.
There are several limitations to our study. Our analyses are 
observational and associational, so they are limited in their 
ability to draw out causal inferences. We lack adjustment for 
other covariates in our model due to the absence of available 
data (partly due to the very recent release of the data). Our 
results should be interpreted cautiously; the study was explor-
atory in nature but offers a useful starting point for further 
analysis. We also use population-level data and therefore cannot 
detect whether delayed discharges for particular individuals 
actually led to deaths.
In conclusion, we have shown that the increasing prevalence 
of delayed discharges within hospitals occurred as mortality rates 
rose in England. Despite the exploratory nature of our study, the

What is already known on this subject
2015 saw the largest annual increase in mortality rates for 
almost 50 years, and mortality rates have remained high since. 
During the same period, there have been funding crises and 
poorer quality of care within the National Health Service (NHS) 
and adult social care.

What this study adds
We demonstrate a positive association between the number of 
acute patients delayed in being discharged, and the cumulative 
amount of time acute patients were delayed, to the monthly 
number of deaths and mortality rate. Our results present 
evidence that a lower quality of performance between the 
NHS and adult social care may explain part of the increases in 
mortality rates experienced in England from at least 2015 and 
onwards.
research report
implications of our findings are important and require urgent 
attention. Greater investment in the NHS and adult social care 
to address the rising levels of delayed discharges may be needed 
to tackle the rapid rise in mortality rates.
