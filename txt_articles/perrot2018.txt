ABSTRACT  
The introduction of novel agents has led to major improvements in clinical outcomes for 
patients with multiple myeloma. In order to shorten evaluation times for new treatments, 
health agencies are currently examining minimal residual disease (MRD) as a surrogate 
endpoint in clinical trials. We assessed the prognostic value of MRD, measured during 
maintenance therapy by next-generation sequencing. MRD negativity was defined as the 
absence of tumor plasma cell within 1,000,000 bone marrow cells (<10-6). Data were 
analyzed from a recent clinical trial that evaluated the role of transplantation in newly 
diagnosed myeloma patients treated with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone 
(RVD). MRD negativity was achieved at least once during maintenance in 127 patients 
(25%). At the start of maintenance therapy, MRD was a strong prognostic factor for both 
progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.34; 
P<0.001) and overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.24; 95%confidence interval, 0.11 to 
0.54; P=0.001). Patients who were MRD negative had a higher probability of prolonged 
progression-free survival than patients with detectable residual disease, regardless of

treatment group (RVD versus transplant), cytogenetic risk profile or international staging 
system disease stage at diagnosis. These results were similar after completion of maintenance 
therapy. Our findings confirm the value of MRD status, as determined by next-generation 
sequencing, as a prognostic biomarker in multiple myeloma, and suggest that this approach 
could be used to adapt treatment strategies in future clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION 
Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the accumulation of 
malignant plasma cells, usually within the bone marrow.1 This disease has long been 
considered incurable, supporting prolongation of overall survival as the major objective in 
both clinical practice and prospective trials. The introduction of several novel drugs over the 
past decade has dramatically improved patient outcomes, extending survival from 3 years to 
more than 10 years in young, transplant-eligible patients.2-5 As a result, overall survival has 
become an unrealistic objective for clinical trials, and most investigators, as well as health 
agencies, now focus on alternative end points, such as progression-free survival or complete 
remission rates. While these two end points may be more realistic, in terms of the time 
required to answer the question, they are far from perfect. Furthermore, with the current 
highly effective drug combinations, complete response (CR) rates have increased 
dramatically from a few percent to up to 80%,6 making this particular end point less useful. A 
solution to improve upon CR is to use more sensitive response assessment techniques, 
enabling quantification of the so-called ‘minimal residual disease (MRD)’. This approach has 
been successfully used in several hematological malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia,7 acute promyelocytic leukemia,8 or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.9 Number of 
pilot studies have shown benefit of achieving MRD negativity using currently available 
methods in myeloma: next-generation flow,10-12 and next-generation sequencing.13 Each of 
these techniques is capable of detecting a single residual malignant plasma cell within 
1,000,000 bone marrow cells.  
Using data from the recent phase 3, Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome (IFM) 2009 
clinical trial, which evaluated the role of transplantation in patients with newly diagnosed 
myeloma treated with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD),11 we assessed 
the prognostic value of MRD measured during maintenance by next-generation sequencing.

PATIENTS AND METHODS 
PATIENTS 
The protocol and clinical results of the IFM 2009 trial, including MRD results obtained by 
multiparametric flow cytometry, have been previously described in detail.14 Briefly, 700 
patients were enrolled in France, Belgium, and Switzerland between 2010 and 2012. The trial 
was approved by local and national health authorities, and all patients signed an informed 
consent form for MRD analyses. Participants were transplant-eligible patients younger than 
66 years of age, with newly diagnosed, symptomatic multiple myeloma. Patients were 
randomized to receive either a conventional-dose strategy (i.e., eight courses of the RVD 
regimen) or an intensive approach comprising three courses of RVD followed by high-dose 
melphalan (200 mg/m²) with autologous stem cell transplantation, and consolidation with a 
further two cycles of RVD. All patients received lenalidomide maintenance therapy for 12 
months. Randomization was stratified according to International Staging System disease 
stage15 and cytogenetic risk profile, with high-risk patients defined at diagnosis by the 
presence of 17p deletion or either t(4;14) or t(14;16) translocation. When this trial was 
designed in 2008, the next-generation sequencing technique was not available; therefore, 
MRD was assessed by low-sensitivity (10-4; i.e., one malignant plasma cell within 10,000 
bone marrow cells) multiparametric flow cytometry in all patients who achieved at least a 
very good partial response following consolidation. Bone marrow samples were collected 
from all such patients at both the start and end of maintenance therapy (the minimal residual 
disease time points), for the measurement of MRD.

When next-generation sequencing commercial kits became available (Sequenta, San 
Francisco, CA, USA),13 DNA was extracted from the stored bone marrow samples and sent 
for sequencing. Briefly, the technique is based on the sequencing of immunoglobulin genes, 
which are clonally rearranged in all myeloma patients and thus represent unique, patient-
specific biomarkers. As the technique required prior identification of the clonal 
rearrangements, tumor DNA obtained from CD138-positive cells at enrolment were sent to 
Sequenta for assessment. The clonal rearrangements were identified using the LymphoSight 
kit (Sequenta, San Francisco, CA, USA). For minimal residual disease quantification, DNA 
was extracted from the bone marrow samples and amplified by polymerase chain reaction 
using immunoglobulin gene-specific primers; the amplified products were then sequenced. 
The sensitivity was 10-6, i.e, one malignant plasma cell within 1,000,000 bone marrow cells. 
MRD levels were reported as follows: less than 10-6; from 10-6 to less than 10-5; from 10-5 to 
less than 10-4; and 10-4 or greater. Patients who failed to achieve at least a very good partial 
response, or who did not enter the maintenance phase of the trial, were considered minimal 
residual disease positive. Based on the results described below (Table S1 and Figs. S1A and 
S1B in the Supplementary Appendix), patients were considered minimal residual disease 
negative when the level was below 10-6. 
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
We assessed the association between minimal residual disease status during maintenance 
therapy and survival end points using  two populations defined at the start, and after the 
completion, of 12 months of maintenance therapy ( landmark times): including only patients 
in whom MRD status was known at this time; and a modified intent-to-treat population that 
only excluded patients who had achieved VGPR, CR or SCR  at both the start and end of 
maintenance therapy, but in whom minimal residual disease was not measured at either time

point Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization or from the 
landmark points until either the first documentation of progressive disease or death from any 
cause. Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization or from the landmark 
points until death. The data were updated in February 2017, and follow-up was estimated 
using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method.4 Survival functions were compared using the log-
rank test or the Mantel-Byar test,17 and graphed using the Kaplan-Meier method or the 
Kaplan-Meier method modified by the Simon−Makuch method18 in the landmark analyses 
and the modified intent-to-treat analyses, respectively. The prognostic value of MRD was 
evaluated using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model including MRD as a fixed 
covariate or as a time-dependent covariate. These models were adjusted for stratification 
factors and treatment groups. Analyses of progression-free survival in specific subgroups 
were performed entering an interaction term between subgroup and minimal residual disease 
status in the Cox models. The proportionality assumptions were checked with Cox-Snell 
residuals. All models were repeated using imputed values for missing assessments. Minimal 
residual disease negativity rates were compared between groups using Chi-square or Fisher’s 
exact test. A logistic model adjusted for stratification factors was used to determine the 
association between treatment group and minimal residual disease status. Tests were two 
sided, and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant. Given the exploratory nature 
of this post-hoc analysis of the IFM 2009 study, no adjustment was made for multiple testing. 
All analyses were conducted using Stata® Version 14.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, 
USA).

RESULTS 
PATIENTS AND NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING MINIMAL RESIDUAL 
DISEASE ASSESSMENTS 
 Minimal residual disease status was assessed in 224 of 366 patients at the start and 183 of 
239 patients after completing maintenance therapy, as they achieved at least a very good 
partial response and were included in the analyses. In all, 138 patients had MRD status 
assessed twice (Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).  The reasons for missing 
assessments in patients who achieved at least a very good partial response are summarized in 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. We also performed a modified intent-to-treat 
analysis which excluded 191 patients who achieved at least a very good partial response at 
both the start and end of maintenance therapy, but in whom MRD was not assessed at either 
time point. Among the 509 remaining patients, 269 in very good partial response were 
assessed at least once during maintenance therapy. Baseline characteristics were comparable 
between patients with known and unknown MRD status, and between treatment arms both at 
the landmark time points and overall (Tables S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).  
Initially evaluating the depth of MRD, we found progression-free survival to be related to the 
level of minimal residual disease at both time points, with the best outcome observed when 
MRD level was below 10-6 (Table S1 and Figs. S1A and S1B in the Supplementary 
Appendix). This level was hence considered as minimal residual disease negative.   
 
MRD STATUS BY TREATMENT ARM, STRATIFICATION FACTORS, AND 
RESPONSE RATES IN THE MODIFIED INTENT-TO-TREAT POPULATION 
Table 1 summarizes the MRD results by treatment arm, stratification factors, and treatment 
response. In total, 127 patients (25%) achieved MRD negative status at least once during 
maintenance: 54 out of 264 patients (20%) in the RVD-alone arm, and 73 out of 245 patients

(30%) in the transplantation arm (adjusted odds ratio for undetectable minimal residual 
disease 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 2.49; P=0.02). The MRD negativity rate did 
not differ according to International Staging System disease stage or cytogenetic risk profile 
(high versus standard risk). Among patients with high-risk cytogenetics, minimal residual 
disease negativity was achieved in 17 out of 42 patients with t(4;14) (40%), but in only three 
out of 28 patients with del(17p) (11%). Among patients who started maintenance therapy, 
31% and 49% of patients who achieved a very good partial response and a complete 
response, respectively, were MRD negative (P=0.006). Of those 233 patients who had 
previously been found to be MRD negative by multiparametric flow cytometry, 120 (52%) 
were confirmed as MRD negative by next-generation sequencing. Change in MRD status 
before and after maintenance therapy is reported in the supplementary appendix (Table S5). 
 
PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL 
The median duration of follow-up was 55, 50, and 38 months from randomization, start and 
completion of maintenance therapy, respectively. Progression-free survival was significantly 
prolonged in minimal residual disease-negative versus minimal residual disease-positive 
patients (Fig. 1). A similar significant difference is also observed using landmark and 
modified intent to treat population (Supplementary Figure S6). Among the 37 minimal 
residual disease-negative patients who progressed or died during follow-up, 34 had a 
serological relapse.  The progression-free survival benefit associated with MRD negativity 
was similar among the different patient subgroups (supplementary Fig. S3). In multivariate 
Cox models adjusted for stratification factors and treatment group, MRD negativity was the 
strongest prognostic factor for progression-free survival (Table2). Similar results were 
observed after having imputed values for missing minimal residual disease assessments 
(supplementary Table S6). As the summary of the results of the Cox models, adjusted

probabilities of progression-free survival presented in Figure 2 and in supplementary figures 
S4 and S5 shows improvement in progression-free survival in those achieving MRD 
negativity irrespective of the treatment received (Transplantation or RVD only arms); or 
standard versus high-risk group or ISS stage I versus stage II or III.  
 
OVERALL SURVIVAL 
Nine deaths occurred among the 127 minimal residual disease-negative patients (7%): four in 
the RVD-alone group, and five in the transplantation group. Five of these deaths were 
myeloma related. Overall survival was significantly prolonged in minimal residual disease-
negative patients versus minimal residual disease-positive patients (Fig. 3 and Supplementary 
Figure S7). Median overall survival was not reached in either group. Owing to the small 
number of deaths among patients who were minimal residual disease negative, subgroup 
analyses were not performed.  
 
Survival analyses, limited to the population of patients assessed by next-generation 
sequencing and according to the change in MRD status before and after maintenance therapy, 
shows a similar progression-free and overall-survival for patients who maintained MRD 
negativity at both measurements or those who became MRD negative after 12 months of 
maintenance. Their survival was significantly superior to those who were either MRD 
positive at both measurements or became positive at the later measurement. (Supplementary 
Figures S8-S9-S10).

required to evaluate new treatments has become a major objective for the myeloma 
community. Minimal residual disease is one of the most promising such biomarkers 
identified to date.19-21 In a recent meta-analysis of studies published between January 1990 
and January 2016, MRD negativity was found to confer an approximate 50% relative 
reduction in the risk of both progression and mortality.22 Although this risk reduction appears 
to be clinically important, a significant proportion of patients classified as MRD negative still 
relapsed and died from disease. An explanation for this observation is the lower level of 
sensitivity of the older multiparametric flow cytometry techniques used in the studies 
included in the meta-analysis. With the development of more advanced technologies and the 
analysis of larger numbers of cells (10 to 20 million), higher sensitivity is now observed.10  
Using next-generation sequencing,13 a technique that offers sensitivity at the 10-6 level, 
we are able to demonstrate that an ability to measure deeper response provides superior 
outcome; e.g. MRD level below 10-6 is predictive of superior PFS compared to 10-5 or 10-4. 
With 10-6 sensitivity, we found MRD negativity to be a strong prognostic biomarker of 
progression-free survival and overall survival. This approach demonstrated a higher level of 
discrimination than had previously been achieved with the less sensitive multiparametric flow 
cytometry technique.14 However, recent data from the Spanish group showed that 10-6 
sensitivity can be achieved by next-generation flow (NGF) as well. Thus it is important to 
note that the methodology used to measure MRD is not as important, as long as we are able 
to measure deeper levels of MRD. For clinical practice and based on availability, any 
platform which achieves adequate sensitivity and reproducibility can be used. Our findings 
support and enhance the recently published International Myeloma Working Group criteria23. 
Survival was prolonged in both high- and standard-risk myeloma patients who were 
MRD negative versus standard-risk MRD-positive patients. This finding raises the possibility 
that achieving MRD negativity may overcome certain adverse risk factors identified at

diagnosis. These results, coupled with the lack of impact of disease stage or cytogenetic risk 
profile on MRD negativity rates, should be kept in mind when discussing prognoses with 
patients not only at diagnosis, but also during the different phases of treatment, as their 
prognosis could be substantially altered by their achieving MRD negative status.  
We found lower rates of MRD negativity among patients who received RVD alone than 
among those who underwent transplantation. However, due to the 80% relative risk reduction 
conferred by MRD negativity, regardless of treatment assignment, progression-free survival 
in MRD-negative patients in the RVD-alone group was similar to that in patients in the 
transplantation group with the same MRD status. Although the risk of progression was 
reduced in the transplantation group versus the RVD-alone group as a whole, it seems 
possible that the role of transplantation may be less clear in patients who achieve MRD 
negativity after induction therapy. As MRD assessments were only available at the start and 
end of maintenance therapy in our study, we were not able to test this hypothesis. Our study 
now provides the rationale to address these questions in future prospective trials to determine 
whether MRD status can be used to inform induction, consolidation, and/or maintenance 
treatments.  
Despite higher sensitivity, biological relapses still occur in MRD negative patients. This 
finding, along with the observed changes in MRD status over one year of maintenance 
therapy, highlight the requirement for serial minimal residual disease assessments to better 
assess the risk of progression. At present, the feasibility of monitoring MRD over time is 
limited by the invasive bone marrow biopsy procedures, but serum based tests to facilitate 
this monitoring are currently undergoing clinical evaluation.  
Although the characteristics of patients excluded from the analyses were comparable to 
those of patients who were included, we should emphasize that potential bias cannot be 
totally excluded since MRD data were unavailable for 50% of patients at the specified time

points. The main reason that MRD was not assessed was the absence of a sample stored at the 
time of diagnosis to identify the clonal rearrangements.  
In a significant number of patients, MRD evaluation was not feasible mainly because of lack 
of diagnostic sample for calibration. Since MRD evaluation by NGS was not planned in 2008 
(because not existing), we did not make significant efforts to spare plasma cells for 
calibration. This point could be a limitation of NGS vs NGF, but, currently, we are able to 
calibrate > 98% of the patients (personal data, HAL). The main advantage of NGS vs NGF is 
the required number of cells to achieve the 10-6 threshold. With NGS, only 2 millions of cells 
are needed, vs at least 20 millions for NGF. In this study we used the Sequenta/Adaptive 
platform. Other platforms (commercial and academic) are available, but to our knowledge, 
the Adaptive kit is the only one which is (almost) FDA-approved. 
 
In conclusion, next-generation sequencing-determined MRD status enables the 
identification of patient subpopulations with highly different prognoses. Consequently, in the 
future, this end point could be used to inform treatment decisions and provide significant 
reassurance for myeloma patients who achieve MRD negativity, regardless of their 
cytogenetic risk profile or disease stage. It is also clear that MRD opens the door to 
evaluation of stratified therapy for multiple myeloma patients in future randomized clinical 
trials.

Figure 1 A. Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves for Progression-Free Survival According to 
Minimal Residual Disease Status at the Start of Maintenance Therapy.  
The median progression-free survival from the start of maintenance therapy was not reached 
among MRD-negative patients, and was 29 months among MRD-positive patients 
Figure 1 B. Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves for Progression-Free Survival According to 
Minimal Residual Disease Status after 12 months of maintenance therapy.  
The median progression-free survival from the completion of maintenance therapy was not 
reached among MRD-negative patients, and was 20 months among MRD-positive patients.  
Figure 1C. Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves Modified by the Simon−Makuch Method for 
Progression-Free Survival According to Minimal Residual Disease Status. 
The number of patients at risk in the MRD-negative group was 0 at the beginning of follow-
up, because of the time-dependent nature of MRD. Prior to the start of maintenance therapy, 
all patients were included in the MRD-positive group; patients who were found to be MRD-
negative on assessment during maintenance were switched to the MRD-negative group. The 
median progression-free survival from randomization was not reached among MRD-negative 
patients, and was 29 months among MRD-positive patients.  
 
Abbreviation: MRD, minimal residual disease.

Figure 3A. Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves for Overall Survival According to Minimal 
Residual Disease Status at the Start of Maintenance Therapy.  
 The overall survival at 4 years after the start of maintenance therapy was 94% among MRD- 
negative patients, and 79% among MRD-positive patients (adjusted hazard ratio for death, 
0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.54). 
Figure 3B. Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves for Overall Survival According to Minimal 
Residual Disease Status After 12 months of Maintenance Therapy. 
The overall survival at 3 years after the completion of maintenance therapy was 96% among 
MRD-negative patients, and 86% among MRD-positive patients (adjusted hazard ratio for 
death, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.68). 
Figure 3C. Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves Modified by the Simon−Makuch Method for 
Overall Survival According to Minimal Residual Disease Status. 
The number of patients at risk in the MRD-negative group was 0 at the beginning of follow-
up, because of the time-dependent nature of minimal residual disease. Prior to the start of 
maintenance therapy, all patients were included in the MRD-positive group; patients who 
were found to be MRD-negative on assessment during maintenance were switched to the 
MRD-negative group. MRD was a strong prognostic factor for overall survival (adjusted 
hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.32).
