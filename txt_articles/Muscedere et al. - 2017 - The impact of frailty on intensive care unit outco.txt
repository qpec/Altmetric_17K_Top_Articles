Abstract 
Purpose: Functional status and chronic health status are important baseline characteristics of critically ill patients. 
The assessment of frailty on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) may provide objective, prognostic information 
on baseline health. To determine the impact of frailty on the outcome of critically ill patients, we performed a system-
atic review and meta-analysis comparing clinical outcomes in frail and non-frail patients admitted to ICU.
Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and 
Clinicaltrials.gov. All study designs with the exception of narrative reviews, case reports, and editorials were included. 
Included studies assessed frailty in patients greater than 18 years of age admitted to an ICU and compared outcomes 
between fit and frail patients. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria, assessed quality, and extracted 
data. The primary outcomes were hospital and long-term mortality. We also determined the prevalence of frailty, 
the impact on other patient-centered outcomes such as discharge disposition, and health service utilization such as 
length of stay.
Results: Ten observational studies enrolling a total of 3030 patients (927 frail and 2103 fit patients) were included. 
The overall quality of studies was moderate. Frailty was associated with higher hospital mortality [relative risk (RR) 1.71; 
95% CI 1.43, 2.05; p < 0.00001; I2 = 32%] and long-term mortality (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.40, 1.68; p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%). The 
pooled prevalence of frailty was 30% (95% CI 29–32%). Frail patients were less likely to be discharged home than fit 
patients (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.49, 0.71; p < 0.00001; I2 = 12%).
Conclusions: Frailty is common in patients admitted to ICU and is associated with worsened outcomes. Identifica-
tion of this previously unrecognized and vulnerable ICU population should act as the impetus for investigating and 
implementing appropriate care plans for critically ill frail patients. Registration: PROSPERO (ID: CRD42016053910).

Take-home message: Frailty is an important baseline characteristic of 
patients who are critically ill. In this meta-analysis, we show that critically 
ill frail patients, compared to non-frail patients, are at increased risk of 
mortality, adverse outcomes, and are less likely to be discharged home.

Introduction
The concept of clinical frailty describes a state or syn-
drome of reduced physical, physiologic, and cognitive 
reserve [1]. Frail patients are characterized by a hetero-
geneous combination of decreased mobility, weakness, 
reduced muscle mass, poor nutritional status, and dimin-
ished cognitive function; all of these render frail indi-
viduals more susceptible to extrinsic stressors. Although 
frailty is more common in older individuals [2], frailty 
and aging are not synonymous [3], and the former has 
been estimated to occur in approximately 25% of those 
over the age of 65 and over 50% of those over the age of 
85 [4]. Frail individuals are more likely to require assisted 
living, be more susceptible to adverse events, and are 
more likely to die when compared to age-matched non-
frail individuals [5, 6]. Frailty has characteristic molecular 
and physiologic features including increases in inflamma-
tory markers [7] and epigenetic changes characterized by 
increased DNA methylation [8].
A number of validated tools to screen for, identify, and 
quantify frailty have been described [3, 9–14]. Frailty 
is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for poor out-
comes across many disease states and healthcare inter-
ventions [15–17]. Similarly, there is emerging evidence 
that frailty status has important implications for individ-
uals developing critical illness [18].
The increased prevalence of frailty with ageing and 
growing utilization of critical care services by older indi-
viduals [19] imply there is likely to be an increased num-
ber of frail patients being admitted to intensive care units 
(ICUs). Considering the diminished resilience and greater 
vulnerability of frail patients, they may be more likely to 
require and have longer durations of the life-sustaining 
ICU therapies but their effectiveness in this population is 
unclear. Studies to date of critically ill frail patients have 
utilized a variety of designs, include variable populations 
and report on a range of outcomes. There is a need to 
synthesize the evidence in its entirety to understand if it 
can inform prognostication or decision-making and to 
identify knowledge gaps to inform future research includ-
ing the potential for targeted interventions. Therefore, we 
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the 
impact of frailty on outcomes for critically ill frail patients 
admitted to the ICU. We hypothesized that frailty would 
be associated with higher hospital and long-term mor-
tality, increased utilization of healthcare resources, and 
prolonged institutionalization. An abstract of this study 
has been accepted for presentation at the 2017 European 
Society of Intensive Care Medicine Conference [20].
Methods
This systemic review was conducted and reported 
according to Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology (MOOSE) Guidelines (see Appendix for 
Moose checklist) [21, 22]. The protocol was registered on 
PROSPERO (ID: CRD42016053910) in December 2016 
after the initial literature search but before the literature 
search was subsequently updated in January and April 
of 2017. Eligible studies included observational stud-
ies or randomized controlled trials (RCT) that reported 
on frailty in ICU settings. Studies were included if they 
included adults (age ≥18 years) admitted to the ICU, 
reported on patient or health services outcomes, and 
used a validated tool to identify frailty. In order to best 
evaluate the impact of frailty, only studies comparing 
frail and non-frail populations were included. Narrative 
reviews, editorials, case reports, case-series, animal stud-
ies, and duplicate publications were excluded. Published 
abstracts were eligible for inclusion and there were no 
language restrictions.
Search strategy
We 
electronically 
searched 
MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, 
CINAHL, and PubMed databases initially in June 2016 
which was then updated in December 2016 and April 
2017. Our search strategy cross-referenced frailty and 
ICUs using appropriate medical subject headings (MeSH) 
and keywords (Appendix—Search strategies). The ref-
erences from selected articles and reviews were manu-
ally searched for additional studies. We also searched 
trial registries and conference abstracts for completed 
but unpublished studies. The searches were developed 
and conducted in consultation with a research librar-
ian. A protocol for this review has not been published 
separately.
Study selection
Two authors (AV and BW) independently evaluated the 
retrieved titles and abstracts of all articles to identify 
potentially relevant studies. Full-text review was con-
ducted when either reviewer deemed that the abstract 
warranted further investigation on the basis of our a pri-
ori eligibility criteria. Any disagreement was resolved by 
discussion and consensus.
Data extraction
Data were independently extracted by AV and BW and 
subsequently verified by JM. Data extracted included 
the following: author, study design, frailty identification 
method, number of frail and non-frail patients, and out-
comes of interest. Outcomes were chosen a priori and 
based on two domains; patient-centered outcomes and 
health services utilization. We collected both unadjusted 
data and adjusted data. The primary outcomes were in-
hospital and long-term mortality (≥6 months following 
ICU admission). Although hospital mortality was initially 
 1107
chosen as the primary outcome, long-term mortality 
was later added to the primary outcome with increased 
availability of data for this outcome. Secondary patient-
centered outcomes were ICU mortality and health-
related quality-of-life (HRQL). Secondary health service 
utilization outcomes were ICU and hospital length of 
stay, receipt of vasoactive agents, receipt and duration of 
mechanical ventilation (MV), and discharge disposition.
Assessment of quality
The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess 
for study quality [23]. The NOS has three domains based 
on selection of the cohort, comparability of the groups, 
and quality of the outcomes. The NOS is a nine-point 
scale with a maximum of four points allocated to selec-
tion, two points for comparability, and three points for 
outcome. The reference for cohort selection was a gen-
eral medical-surgical adult ICU population and the out-
come reference was in-hospital mortality. Studies scoring 
7 or more were considered high quality; 4–6, moderate 
quality; and 4 or less, low quality.
Data analysis
A meta-analysis was performed, where possible, using 
Review Manager 5.3 software (Cochrane Collabora-
tion). We primarily pooled unadjusted data, although 
where possible we pooled adjusted data. For the pur-
poses of data aggregation where more than one frailty 
scale was reported, we used the scale most commonly 
reported across all the included studies. We calculated 
pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals 
(95% CI) using a random effects model for dichotomous 
outcomes and weighted mean difference with 95% CIs 
for continuous data. Where data were reported as medi-
ans it was converted to means and standard deviation 
[24]. Additional unpublished data were sought from 
authors. A priori planned subgroup analyses were con-
ducted on the basis of the method of frailty identifica-
tion, the severity of frailty, age of included subjects, 
and study quality. We hypothesized that the method 
of frailty identification would significantly change the 
effect estimate on outcomes, that increasing severity of 
frailty would be associated with higher mortality, that 
older frail patients would have higher mortality, and 
that there would be a decrease in the strength of asso-
ciation between frailty and outcomes in high quality 
studies.
Statistical heterogeneity was determined using the 
Mantel–Haenszel (M–H) Chi-squared test and the 
interclass correlation (I2) statistic [25]. Significant het-
erogeneity was defined as I2 > 50% or as p < 0.10 with 
the Mantel–Haenszel Chi-squared test. Funnel plots 
were used to visually inspect for publication bias. We 
considered an unadjusted, two-sided p < 0.05 to be sta-
tistically significant. To assess the probability that the 
results obtained were robust, we conducted trial sequen-
tial analysis (TSA) on long-term mortality with a two-
sided α = 5%, a power of 90%, and the assumption that 
the absence of frailty would be associated with at least a 
20% relative risk reduction in long-term all-cause mor-
tality. The TSA was conducted with version 0.9.5.5 Beta 
(www.ctu.dk/tsa).
Results
Study selection
The initial search identified 1413 articles and abstracts 
(Appendix Fig. 1). After screening the titles and abstracts, 
406 duplicates and 204 unrelated papers were excluded. 
A further 776 titles were excluded on the basis of publica-
tion type. Twenty-nine full-text articles were assessed; 17 
studies did not meet inclusion criteria, leaving a total of 
12 publications from 10 separate studies fulfilling eligibil-
ity since two studies reported new data in two separate 
publications each [26–37].
Summary of studies
The characteristics of the included studies are summa-
rized in Tables 1 and 2. All were prospective observa-
tional cohort studies where frailty was measured on ICU 
admission; the majority were conducted in medical-sur-
gical ICUs. Frailty was assessed using the clinical frailty 
scale (CFS) [3] in seven studies, a frailty index (FI) [38] in 
four, and the frailty physical phenotype (FP) [39] in two 
(Table 3). Of 3030 patients enrolled in the ten studies, 
927 patients were classified as frail and 2103 as non-frail 
patients. The pooled prevalence of frailty in the ICU pop-
ulations studied was 30% (95% CI 29–32%) (Fig. 1).
Study quality
There were no randomized controlled studies and the 
overall quality of the studies was moderate with mean 
(SD) NOS score of 6.5 (1.3) and a range of 5–8 (Table 4). 
There were five high quality studies with a score of 7 or 
above [26, 27, 32, 33, 35].
Mortality
All ten studies reported on mortality. Data could be 
abstracted for hospital mortality in nine studies, ICU 
mortality in six studies, and long-term mortality in six 
studies. Pooled unadjusted data using any frailty meas-
ure revealed an increased risk for frail patients compared 
to non-frail patients for hospital mortality (RR 1.71; 95% 
CI 1.43, 2.05; p < 0.00001; I2 = 32%) and long-term mor-
tality (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.40, 1.68; p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%) 
(Fig. 2). Pooled ICU mortality data revealed significantly 
increased risk of mortality for those identified as frail (RR

Comments
Clinical frailty scale (CFS) [3]
Nine-point scale based on subjective 
assessment of functional status
Scale ranges from very fit (CFS = 1) to very 
severely frail (CFS = 8) and terminally ill 
(CFS = 9). Examples: very fit people are 
robust, active, energetic, and motivated 
while very severely frail is defined as 
someone who is completely dependent, 
approaching end of life
Usually CFS ≥ 4
Yes
Scale is simple and easy to use. It can be 
used by a variety of healthcare profes-
sionals
Frailty index (FI) [37]
Deficit model of frailty assessment where 
the degree of frailty is calculated by 
dividing the total deficits by the total 
number items assessed
Usually 30–70 items are assessed. Any 
item can be included in the index as 
long as it meets the following criteria:
Item deficits increase with age
Item is associated with health
Item does not saturate with increasing 
age
Items must cover a range of systems
Usually
FI > 0.2
Yes
Often based on a comprehensive geriatric 
assessment including cognition, func-
tional status, and co-morbid illnesses. 
Large number of items included can be 
challenging for its routine use, although 
it can be imbedded in clinical systems to 
make use of existing data
Frailty phenotype (FP) [9]
Frailty tool based on the presence of 
physical phenotypic features
Calculated by the number of phenotypic 
features present:
Weakness
Slowness
Physical activity
Weight loss
Self-reported exhaustion
Usually
FP > 2
Yes
Focused on objective and self-reported cri-
teria for physical function. No assessment 
of cognition

1.51; 95% CI 1.31, 1.75; p < 0.00001; I2 = 8%) (Appen-
dix Fig. 2). TSA for long-term mortality found that 
the required information size was 1514 and the Z line 
crossed both conventional boundaries and information 
size indicating that the association of frailty and long-
term mortality was robust (Appendix Fig. 3).
ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS)
Six studies reported hospital LOS [26, 28, 29, 32, 33, 
35] and five studies ICU LOS [26, 28, 29, 32, 35]. Pooled 
hospital and ICU LOS demonstrated non-statistically 
significant longer stays for frail patients with the mean 
differences being 3.39 days (95% CI −0.33, 7.10; p = 0.07; 
I2 = 77%) and 0.33 days (95% CI −0.78, 1.44; p = 0.56; 
I2 = 73%) (Appendix Fig. 4) respectively.
Mechanical ventilation and vasopressors
Five of the 10 studies, which included 703 frail and 1591 
non-frail patients, reported on receipt of MV [26, 27, 29, 
32, 35]. There was no difference between groups in the 
use of MV (80% vs 82% for frail vs. non-frail patients 
respectively: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.93, 1.10; p = 0.81; 
I2 = 67%). Only one study compared MV duration 
between groups and found no difference [28]. In addi-
tion, five of the 10 studies, which included 442 frail and 
1008 non-frail patients, compared the use of vasoactive 
therapy between these groups [26–29, 35]. There was no 
difference in the use of vasoactive therapy (58% vs 56% 
for frail vs. non-frail patients respectively: RR 1.05; 95% 
CI 0.88, 1.26; p = 0.57; I2 = 61%).
Discharge to home versus hospital or assisted living
Five of the 10 studies reported on discharge disposition [26, 
28, 29, 31, 35]. The discharge destinations included home, 
rehabilitation facility, nursing home, or another acute care 
institution. As a result of the variety of post-discharge set-
tings, we were only able to aggregate data for home which 
was reported in four studies [26, 28, 29, 35]. In these stud-
ies, reporting on 416 frail and 912 non-frail patients, frail 
patients were less likely to be discharged home (RR 0.59; 
95% CI 0.49, 0.71; p < 0.00001; I2 = 12%) (Fig. 3).
Quality of life
Only two studies reported on HRQL [26, 32, 40]. Both 
studies reported reduced quality of life at 1 year related 
to poor physical function in those who were identified 
as being frail on ICU admission (Table 2). Bagshaw et al. 
also found worsened quality life related to mental health.
Subgroup analyses
Frailty measure
We conducted subgroup analysis for the association of 
frailty, as measured with the CFS, FI, and FP, with hos-
pital and long-term mortality (Fig. 4, Appendix Fig. 5). 
In the seven studies using the CFS data could be pooled 
including 775 frail and 1875 non-frail patients [26, 28, 
31–33, 35, 37] and the RR for hospital mortality was 1.54; 
95% CI 1.33, 1.77; p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%. For the two stud-
ies pooled on the basis of an FI, the RR for hospital mor-
tality was 3.71; 95% CI 0.22, 63.42; p = 0.36; I2 = 76% [27, 
29] and for two studies reporting on hospital mortality

using the FP [28, 33] RR was 1.24; 95% CI 0.85, 1.81; 
p = 0.32; I2 = 0%. On testing for interaction, there was 
not a statistically significant difference between the 
measures of frailty for the risk of hospital and long-term 
mortality (p = 0.49 and p = 0.26, respectively).
Severity of frailty
Of the ten studies, eight reported on the incremen-
tal risk of adverse outcomes, mainly mortality, with 
increasing frailty score; seven demonstrated increased 
risk with increased frailty severity while only one did

not demonstrate an association. Differences in methods 
of reporting precluded pooling of data. Bagshaw et al. 
reported that increases in frailty severity as measured by 
the CFS incrementally increased risk of death adjusted 
for age, co-morbidities, and severity of illness at 1 year 
relative to those not frail [26]. Similarly, Brummel et al. 
reported a stepwise increase in 12-month mortality with 
each CFS point increase; a CFS of 1 was associated with 
approximately 90% 1-year survival rate, a CFS of 5 had 
50% survival, and those with a CFS of 6/7 had a 35% sur-
vival rate [32]. Heyland et al. found that increasing FI was 
associated with decreased chance of being discharged 
home and that at 12 months, in multivariate mod-
els for every 0.2 increase in FI, the odds ratio of recov-
ery to baseline physical function was 0.32 (0.19, 0.56; 
p < 0.0001) and survival was 0.56 (0.37, 0.85; p = 0.007) 
[35]. Kizilarslanoglu et al. categorized patients as robust 
(FI < 0.25), pre-frail (FI 0.25–0.40), and frail (FI > 0.40); 
6-month mortality increased as the FI increased, 55.9%, 
70.3%, and 84.6% respectively [27]. Le Maguet el al. dem-
onstrated that increasing CFS scores and increasing FP 
frailty characteristics were associated with increased 
risk of mortality at 6 months [28]. Mueller et al. found 
that increasing FI correlated with reduced muscle mass 
as measured by ultrasound [29]. Similarly Zeng et al. 
found that the degree of frailty as measured by FI corre-
lated with increased risk of mortality at both 30 days and 
300 days [34]. Only one single-center study did not find a 
significant correlation between increasing CFS and mor-
tality [31].
Impact of age
Six studies adjusted for age in the association between 
frailty and outcome [26, 27, 32–35] and in all of these 
studies, frailty was independently associated with adverse 
outcomes. Five of the studies included older adults of a 
minimum age as part of their inclusion criteria; one used 
the age of 50 [26], one used 60 [27], two used the age of 
65 [28, 34], and one used the age of 80 [35]. The incidence 
of frailty in studies enrolling only older adults was 33.1% 
(95% CI 23.4, 43.5%) compared to 30% in all the included 
studies.

Study quality
There were five high quality studies [26, 27, 32, 33, 
35] all reporting on hospital and long-term mortal-
ity. In these studies, frailty continued to be associated 
with increased risk of hospital and long-term mortal-
ity (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.38, 1.91; p < 0.0001; I2 = 15% 
and RR 1.51; 95% CI 1.37, 1.66; p < 0.0001, I2 = 0%, 
respectively) (Appendix Figs. 6 and 7). On testing 
for interaction, we found that the increased risk for 
both hospital and long-term mortality was similar in 
both the high and low quality studies, (p = 0.54 and 
p = 0.15, respectively).
Adjusted outcomes
Nine studies reported outcomes adjusted for co-var-
iates including age, illness severity, and co-morbidi-
ties, although there was a large degree of variability in 
the adjusted outcomes reported and the co-variates 
included in the adjustment models. All of the adjusted 
data reported in the studies is summarized in Table 5. 
We were only able to aggregate adjusted data for three 
studies reporting on long-term mortality [26, 28, 32]. In 
this pooled adjusted data (Appendix Fig. 8), frailty was 
associated with increased risk of long-term mortality 
with a hazard ratio of 1.75 (95% CI 1.36, 2.24; p < 0.0001; 
I2 = 43%).
Publication bias
Publication bias was assessed visually using a funnel plot 
for hospital mortality; there was no significant evidence 
of publication bias (Appendix Fig. 9).
Discussion
Key findings
In this systematic review of 10 observational studies we 
found that frailty was common, occurring in approxi-
mately 30% of adult ICU admissions. We also found that 
frailty was associated with increased risk of hospital and 
long-term mortality and that frail patients were less likely 
to have home as a discharge destination. We found no 
significant difference among frail and non-frail patients 
in the receipt of mechanical ventilation, receipt of vaso-
active therapy, or duration of ICU stay. Increasing sever-
ity of frailty was associated with worsened outcomes 
including hospital and long-term mortality and our find-
ings were robust when we analyzed high quality studies, 
adjusted data, and in trial sequential analysis.
Context
Although frailty has been long recognized by geriat-
ric medicine, it has only been recently identified as 
an important determinant of prognosis for critically 
ill patients and our systematic review supports this. 
Our findings are consistent with the observation that 
frail patients are at increased risk of poor outcomes in 
other settings and after healthcare interventions [41, 
42]. Potential causes for poor outcomes experienced by 
critically ill frail patients include its underlying patho-
physiology of neuromuscular weakness, sarcopenia, 
decreased oxygen utilization, inflammation, and immu-
nosenescence [9, 18, 43] reflecting a wide range of age-
related molecular and cellular deficits [44, 45]. These may 
increase susceptibility to inflammatory insults and noso-
comial infections common in critical illness. Diminished 
reserve arising from the multisystem nature of frailty 
may increase adverse effects of critical illness treatments 
such as bed rest, sedation, polypharmacy, instrumenta-
tion, and MV. Additionally, the reduced resilience of frail 
patients and increased likelihood of comorbid conditions 
[46] may make their recovery more difficult [47] and pro-
longed with reduced probability of returning to baseline 
increasing the chances of institutionalization [5, 6, 18]. 
In our study, we found that frail ICU patients were at an 
increased risk of not being discharged home, although 
this was reported in only four studies.
We did not find significant differences in ICU LOS, 
although there was a non-statistically significant increase 
in hospital stay. The only study reporting duration of MV 
found no difference between frail and non-frail patients 
[28]. This is unexpected since there are many factors, 
including diminished resilience, that may increase recov-
ery time in frail patients prolonging their ICU and hospi-
tal stays as compared to non-frail patients. For example, 
frail patients may be more difficult to wean from mechan-
ical ventilation because of weakness, sarcopenia, and 
decreased oxygen uptake [9, 17, 18, 43]. Further, as a result 
of immunosenescence, frail patients may need more time 
to recover from infections including those nosocomially 
acquired [45]. Our results are not in keeping with data in 
surgical populations, which have demonstrated that frail 
patients have longer stays in hospital and recovery time 
[6]. Possible reasons for these results include incomplete 
reporting of data, impact of end-of-life care or limita-
tions of care influenced by frailty status, and discharge 
practices. A further factor that may have influenced the 
LOS data and duration of organ support is survival bias. 
Frail patients may have died earlier than the non-frail and 
this may have been associated with reduced LOS, as well 
as the duration of organ support. Data which would have 
allowed examination of this, such as “days alive and free 
of organ support”
, was rarely reported with only Bagshaw 
et al. finding that hospital LOS was prolonged in frail sur-
vivors. These data should be described in futures studies 
focused on frailty in ICU settings.

Implications for clinicians, policy, and research
An important aspect of this work is to determine if 
ICU processes of care can be modified to improve out-
comes for those identified as frail. Examples of processes 
which may have differential impact in those who are frail 
include nutritional support, sedation practices, inten-
sity of mobilization/rehabilitation etc. While research 
is being conducted on how to improve outcomes, ongo-
ing awareness of frailty as a marker of risk is important 
and may lead to better advanced care planning. Implicit 
in this is the recognition that frailty is not only associ-
ated with the elderly but may even occur in younger 
ages [26, 32]. Moreover, frailty may provide a better 
method to evaluate the trajectory of chronic health and 
its determinants such as cognition, mobility, function, 
and social engagement leading to ICU admission. Cur-
rents methods such as co-morbidity indices and chronic 
health evaluations integrated into illness severity scores 
and mortality prediction models are likely insufficient 
given the incremental impact of frailty on outcomes 
after adjusting for illness. Our work supports the value 
for implementation of frailty screening at the time of 
ICU admission. Since all the scales used in the included 
studies correlated with worsened outcomes; after further 
validation, the CFS which is the most studied, least time 
intensive, and easy to apply would be the most promis-
ing candidate.
ICU researchers and clinicians, who routinely meas-
ure co-morbidities, may question why frailty should be 
additionally measured or measured instead. The value 
of frailty is that it is a reflection of overall function 
which is not the case for co-morbidity, although frailty 
and co-morbidities are inherently intertwined in rela-
tion to the degree of frailty [48]. Fried and colleagues 
attempted to “untangle” these constructs but there 
is considerable overlap which increases with age [11]. 
Work on defining health deficit accumulation through 
network modeling shows that what matters the most 
is the density of a deficits connections to other deficits 
which is not captured by simple counting of deficits 
[49–51]. As an individual ages and accumulates defi-
cits, as would be the case in many older people who are 
critically ill, the more that frailty and co-morbidity are 
inextricably intertwined.
Limitations
Although the association between frailty and poor out-
comes from critical illness is supported by its underly-
ing pathophysiology, it should be emphasized that the 
studies in our review were observational, may have been 
prone to bias, and causation cannot be determined. 
Two key potential biases are selection and confirmation 
biases. None of the studies applied the gold standard for 
frailty determination which is a comprehensive geriatric 
assessment performed by a specialist in geriatric medi-
cine [52]. All these studies identified patients after ICU 
admission and we have no data on frail and non-frail 
patients declined ICU admission. In addition, the percep-
tion and identification of frailty may have influenced care 
received and limitations of care. Similarly we are unable 
to ascertain the role of survival bias in our results. Fur-
thermore, we were limited in our ability to pool adjusted 
data because of heterogeneity in its reporting. However, 
supporting the importance of frailty as a determinant of 
outcome was that high quality studies which controlled 
for age and other co-founders including illness sever-
ity found that frailty was independently associated with 
adverse outcomes. In addition, we found that frail and 
non-frail patients had similar rates of mechanical venti-
lation and use of vasopressors reducing the likelihood of 
care limitations. Moreover, in most of the studies there 
was a frailty dose response where increasing frailty cor-
related with increasingly worse outcomes.
An additional limitation is that the included studies 
used three different frailty measures: the CFS, FP, and 
FI. We included all of these studies since frailty measures 
generally correlate well with each other [13]. When we 
performed subgroup analysis the results remained simi-
lar across all measures of frailty. However, unanswered 
questions remain including which is the most appropri-
ate measure in the ICU setting? Should there be an ICU-
specific frailty measure? Does it matter which measure 
if they all show similar trends for outcome? If this is the 
case, the one that is least time consuming and most fea-
sible may be a reasonable starting point. Limitations also 
include variable reporting of outcomes, data originating 
from different healthcare settings, and need to transform 
data for aggregation. Further, the late registry in PROS-
PERO, the addition of long-term mortality as an out-
come, and lack of a published protocol with a statistical 
plan could all increase the risk of bias.
Conclusions
Clinically frail patients are at increased risk of adverse 
outcomes because of physiological vulnerability when 
stressors are experienced. In this study, we demonstrate 
significantly increased risk of mortality and adverse out-
comes in critically ill frail patients. Routine assessment 
of frailty at ICU admission may provide clinicians prog-
nostic information for survival and recovery for their 
frail ICU patients. Importantly, this may help patients 
and their families make informed decisions about goals-
of-care when they are critically ill. Importantly, further 
research is required to determine if there are modifiable 
factors that can improve outcomes for critically ill frail 
patients.
