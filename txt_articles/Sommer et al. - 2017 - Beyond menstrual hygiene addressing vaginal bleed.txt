AbstrAct
Girls and women experience numerous types of vaginal 
bleeding. These include healthy reproductive processes, 
such as menstruation and bleeding after childbirth, 
but also bleeding related to health conditions, such as 
fibroids or cancer. In most societies, the management 
of menstruation is handled covertly, something girls are 
often instructed about at menarche. The management of 
other vaginal bleeding is often similarly discreet, although 
behaviours are not well documented. In many societies, 
cultural taboos frequently hinder open discussion around 
vaginal bleeding, restricting information and early access 
to healthcare. Additionally, the limited availability of clean, 
accessible water and sanitation facilities in many low 
and middle-income countries augments the challenges 
girls and women face in conducting daily activities while 
managing vaginal bleeding, including participating in 
school or work, going to the market or fetching water. 
This paper aims to highlight the key vaginal bleeding 
experiences throughout a woman’s life course and the 
intersection of these bleeding experiences with their 
access to adequate water and sanitation facilities, 
information and education sources, and supplies. The aim 
is to address the silence around girls and women’s vaginal 
bleeding and their related social, physical and clinical 
management needs across the life course; and highlight 
critical gaps that require attention in research, practice and 
policy around this neglected topic of health and gender 
equality.
IntroductIon
Attention to women and girls’ health risks 
and outcomes beyond the reproductive years 
is increasing,1 2 with life course approaches 
emphasising that health is dynamic and cumu-
lative, and influenced by genetic, biological, 
behavioural, social and economic contexts.3 
This paper assesses the range of vaginal 
bleeding episodes (‘episodes’ herein used to 
represent episodic vaginal bleeding, including 
both menstrual and due to other causes) that 
girls and women may experience during the 
life course, and their associated needs for 
information, supplies water and sanitation. 
Based on the recent, growing knowledge base 
of the challenges women and girls in low and 
middle-income countries (LMIC) face during 
menstruation due to these needs being 
largely unmet,4 5 this paper hypothesises that 
the evidence to date represents the ‘tip of an 
iceberg.’ A life course approach is required, 
one that looks at vaginal bleeding including 
and beyond menstruation, to comprehen-
sively address the critical needs of girls and 
women for information, supplies, water and 
sanitation in LMICs.

Throughout the life course, girls and women experi-
ence numerous episodes of vaginal bleeding, many of 
which remain hidden due to misinformation, fear, embar-
rassment, shame and taboo.6 This features the more 
widely known bleeding experience of monthly menstru-
ation, as well as other less discussed bleeding episodes, 
including those related to pregnancy, childbirth and 
postpartum, miscarriage, cancers and endometriosis (see 
table 1). To navigate these experiences, girls and women 
require factual and supportive information that enables 
them to differentiate between healthy and abnormal 
bleeding, to understand and take care of their bodies or 
those of dependents who may require assisted care, and 
to seek health advice appropriately. To manage vaginal 
bleeding hygienically and with dignity requires adequate 
(clean, safe, private, affordable and accessible at any 
time) water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities, 
and supplies (ie, soap, sanitary products, basins). Basic 
essentials required to manage menstrual needs have 
only recently been characterised (see box 1). The ways 
in which women and girls manage these bleeding expe-
riences can vary greatly depending on factors associated 
with the bleeding itself, their particular life course trajec-
tory (age, agency, previous life experiences) and the 
broader physical and social environments in which they 
operate. For women living in LMICs, support and WASH 
services are particularly lacking.
Definition of adequate menstrual hygiene manage-
ment
Women and adolescent girls are using a clean menstrual 
management material to absorb or collect menstrual 
blood, that can be changed in privacy as often as neces-
sary for the duration of a menstrual period, using soap 
and water for washing the body as required, and having 
access to facilities to dispose of used menstrual manage-
ment materials. They understand the basic facts linked 
to the menstrual cycle and how to manage it with dignity 
and without discomfort or fear.7
the types of bleeding experienced over the life course
There are numerous types of vaginal bleeding experi-
enced by girls and women. Some are part of a healthy 
reproductive cycle over the life course, and others are 
linked to specific disease conditions. The majority of 
girls and women will experience monthly menstruation. 
Given the declining age of puberty (and menarche) and 
decreasing fertility rates in many parts of the world,8–10 
the number of years during which a girl or woman will 
experience monthly menstrual bleeding has expanded 
along with the number of episodes. If the average girl 
reaches menarche around age 12, and the average age 
of menopause is 51–52 years old, that is over 40 years of 
monthly bleeding (480 months, estimated 2400 menstru-
al-related bleeding days for average cycle length of 
5 days), with exceptions for disrupted menstruation due 
to stress, travel, nutrition, pregnancy and breast feeding 
(although many pregnancies include spotting). A propor-
tion of those will experience some form of menorrhagia 
or abnormal bleeding, which can include spotting 
throughout the month, episodes of very heavy and painful 
bleeding or months with no bleeding. Women are likely 
to experience episodes of bleeding for 4–6 weeks after a 
miscarriage and 4 weeks postpartum.11 This has particular 
significance for those in LMIC with high fertility rates (ie, 
multiple pregnancies and/or miscarriages). In addition, 
it is estimated that 5%–15% of women of reproductive 
age globally have abnormal uterine bleeding.12 Episodes 
of vaginal bleeding may occur prior to menarche,13 14 
occur during perimenopause15 and may occur postmeno-
pause due to illness conditions.
Although minimal prevalence data exist across LMIC, 
there are likely to be significant numbers of women who 
experience vaginal bleeding related to reproductive 
health conditions, such as fibroids or endometriosis. 
One study from Nigeria suggested that 29% of women 
of reproductive age have fibroids.16 Both conditions 
can mean extremely heavy irregular bleeding along 
with discomfort. A cross-sectional internet study 
among 21 476 women in eight high and middle-income 
countries found that 33% of women with fibroids experi-
enced bleeding between periods compared with 14% of 
women without, and significantly greater proportions of 
women with fibroids reported heavy menstrual bleeding, 
prolonged menstrual bleeding, and more frequent and 
irregular menses as compared with their counterparts.17 
In Senegal and Mali, 52 and 51 (per 100,000) of disabili-
ty-adjusted life years are estimated for uterine fibroids.18 
The causes of both uterine fibroids and endometriosis 
are unknown.
As life expectancies increase, women across LMIC are 
more likely to experience uterine or cervical cancers,19 
both of which cause vaginal bleeding. Cervical cancer, 
caused by certain strains of human papilloma virus 
(HPV), is the most common form of cancer currently 
reported among women in sub-Saharan Africa, with 
34 000 out of 100 000 diagnosed each year (and limited 
screening suggests underdiagnoses).20 HPV is spread 
through vaginal, anal and oral sex, meaning that previous 
life events influence risk.
These issues suggest significant implications for the 
girls, women and caregivers who may struggle to manage 
illness-related vaginal bleeding for themselves or their 
dependents. All vaginal bleeding episodes potentially 
cause subjective experiences of fear, discomfort and 
anxiety.21–23 Physically, frequent or prolonged bleeds 
add to girls and women’s risk of anaemia, particularly 
for those who are nutritionally compromised, or having 
comorbidities such as HIV.24 Concomitant weakness, 
fatigue and other symptoms may affect their ability 
to complete the heavy burden of chores,25 a challenge 
compounded by insufficient access to safe, private and 
clean WASH facilities, and mechanisms for disposal of 
bloody absorbent materials, or private spaces for washing 
and drying reusable soiled materials, as well as a lack of 
adequate information and support.4

the challenges of managing vaginal bleeding in low-resource 
contexts
Although girls and women living in high-income coun-
tries may struggle to understand the nature and length 
of their menstrual cycle, most will have access to informa-
tion resources and support (ie, internet, clinics, libraries) 
to confirm their bleeding is healthy or if clinical care 
is needed. Nearly all girls and women have access to 
private, clean, safe toilets with water and disposal at 
home, school, work and in public places, and a range of 
sanitary products so they are able to manage regular or 
unexpected/irregular bleeding and differing blood flows 
with dignity, privacy and comfort. This may not be the 
case for homeless26 or hard to reach girls and women 
in high-income countries, or those who are otherwise 
disadvantaged in relation to their access to credible infor-
mation and adequate WASH facilities, such as prisoners27 
and migrant workers.28
Although there exists almost no literature on manage-
ment of other episodes of vaginal bleeding in LMIC, 
there is growing evidence on the menstruation-related 
barriers facing adolescent girls and female teachers 
in school environments.4 These include the inade-
quate provision of guidance and support, supplies and 
WASH facilities in schools.29 30 Girls across LMIC are 
frequently not informed about menarche prior to their 
first bleeding episode,31 and studies have highlighted 
the misconceptions and shame shrouding menstruation 
in many societies,4 29 30 32 and the fear and anxiety many 
girls experience at menarche and when menstruating at 
school.21 Even when menarche’s arrival is celebrated, girls 
are taught to hide and manage menstruation discreetly,33 
with some findings illustrating a wider misunderstanding 
among women and adults in society.34 Studies are 
being conducted currently to assess if the provision of 
improved menstrual hygiene management information 
and supplies impacts girls’ educational, psychosocial, 
sexual and reproductive health outcomes.
the importance of water, sanitation, hygiene and supplies for 
bleeding management in low-income contexts
Sanitation facilities provide a potential private space for 
managing bleeding including washing, changing and 
disposal. Yet, over 2.4 billion people living around the 
world do not have access to improved sanitation.7 And, 
on any given day, more than 800 million girls and women 
between the ages of 15 and 49 are menstruating,35 
suggesting that a significant number of women and girls 
likely do not have access to a place to manage both light 
and heavy episodes of bleeding. Moreover, this number 
is an underestimate given that women do menstruate 
before age 15 and after age 49 and it does not include 
women and girls who are experiencing non-menstrua-
tion-related bleeding. Non-menstrual types of vaginal 
bleeding may impact very young girls and women of 
advanced age who may need supplies and facilities that 
are more appropriate for their size and needs, but that 
may be unavailable. Further, even where facilities exist, 
some girls and women may avoid managing vaginal 
bleeding in toilets, if they consider them too dirty, unsafe 
or lacking necessary supplies. For example, in Niger, only 
44% of women,7 19–45 and in Kaduna State, Nigeria, only 
37% of women report having everything they need to 
manage their menstruation.36
There also exists a gap in empirical evidence on the 
impact of inadequate WASH in the workplace for girls 
and women experiencing vaginal bleeding,5 and on the 
violence-related challenges facing those using communal 
(and even household) WASH facilities when using 
outside toilets at night, or going for open defecation.37 38 
Heavy blood flow is particularly difficult to manage where 
leaking (ie, blood staining the clothes) breaches the 
taboo of secrecy causing shame, and where inadequate 
facilities and supplies for bleeding management may 
disproportionately hinder engaging in daily activities of 
living.
In some contexts, there may be cultural practices 
restricting access to water or comfortable environments 
to manage vaginal bleeding, such as in Nepal where 
menstruating and postpartum girls and women are 
confined to sleeping in a cowshed or hut.39 In some 
cultures, menstruating girls and women are prohibited 
from touching water sources or using sanitation facilities 
given the association of menstruation with impurity.40 
This may have implications for the ability to hygienically 
manage other vaginal bleeding.
There is also growing attention to the challenges 
displaced menstruating girls and women face, including 
those in transit, highlighting the need for increased atten-
tion to menstrual management in humanitarian response 
contexts. This includes, for example, the improved provi-
sion of supplies, information and WASH facilities with 
disposal systems, along with addressing other vaginal 
bleeding needs (ie, pads in health clinics).41 Displaced 
girls and women are often living in crowded conditions, 
with numerous family members or strangers crowded into 
shelters, and sharing WASH facilities that may lack locks 
and water. The hygiene kits handed out to households 
(ie, cloths or sanitary pads, underwear, buckets) may not 
adequately account for the numbers of menstruating 
girls and women in a given household, or for episodes of 
vaginal bleeding beyond menstruation.
In focusing on the intersectionality of bleeding episodes 
and WASH, it is important to highlight the need for facili-
ties to wash or bathe, which are not always the same spaces 
in which girls and women can best manage bleeding-re-
lated materials. It is also important to include disposal 
facilities, so that women and girls do not face stress from 
blood-stained materials being seen by others.35 42
Education and awareness of healthy and abnormal bleeding 
in LMIcs
The structural realities of girls and women’s lives in many 
LMICs create a gap in information through, for example, 
minimum media exposure to health messages, the lack of 
accessible health clinics that are focused on reproductive

health43; the low rates of secondary and tertiary educa-
tion persisting in many countries,44 45 the lower access to 
internet and media that girls and women have in compar-
ison to boys and men46 47; and health clinic staff who may 
be insufficiently trained to conduct differential diag-
nosis or to be adequately supportive of questions about 
vaginal bleeding.48 Girls and women’s access to services 
may also differ depending on their age, marital status, 
geographical location and economic status, along with 
the prevailing gendered norms in the household influ-
encing the seeking of care.49 50
Some studies in LMIC have documented girls and 
women’s questions and concerns about perceived irreg-
ularity of their monthly menstrual flow.51 They may 
fear disclosing new bleeding from a misconception that 
they would be punished, as has been found with girls in 
Ethiopia, Ghana and other countries; or fear disclosing 
irregular menstruation out of concern they will be 
perceived as infertile and unmarriageable.51
ongoing secrecy around vaginal bleeding
Though international development priorities have, 
to some extent, targeted adolescence and reproduc-
tive health related to childbearing, there is a marked 
silence around vaginal bleeding that girls and women 
experience over 40–50 years of the life course. This 
silence hinders attention to the significant informa-
tion, and WASH-related needs that they face to manage 
bleeding, and may hinder the seeking out of healthcare 
as needed.
More specifically, recent studies in India highlighted 
the ‘sanitation-related psychosocial stress’ girls and 
women experience around their sanitation needs 
(ie, urination, defecation, menstruation).52 53 While 
episodes of vaginal bleeding beyond menstruation 
are not noted, menstruation-related behaviours were 
considered the most stressful for women.52 Such stress 
may be exacerbated by a lack of adequate management 
guidance, particularly for bleeding episodes that are 
not openly discussed. For example, it is likely that many 
girls in low-income contexts are inadequately informed 
about irregular monthly bleeding, or that women 
feel inadequately informed about how to manage 
heavy bleeding and discomfort from fibroids or endo-
metriosis. Given the density of obstetricians across 
low-income countries ranges from 0.042 to 12.5 per 
100 000,54 with many healthcare workers who may not 
have quality training in reproductive health conditions 
and illnesses, girls and women may struggle to access 
healthcare to understand what is happening in their 
bodies and to receive treatment for their conditions, 
and to openly discuss an increased need for hygienic 
toilet facilities and supplies.
concLusIon
There is a significant empirical gap in the evidence on 
episodes of vaginal bleeding and the related information 
and management needs of girls and women in LMIC. 
Along with better understanding of the information, 
supplies and WASH-related challenges that girls and 
women encounter in different cultural, economic 
and geographical contexts, there is a need to develop 
appropriate evidence-based policy and programming 
to meet their needs. Individuals’ experience of health 
throughout the life course depends on the resources 
available in the places inhabited, and the agency they 
are able to exercise given physical and social opportuni-
ties and constraints. A first step is breaking the silence 
around the topic of vaginal bleeding, from the global 
to the local level, so that girls and women are able to 
seek out the healthcare and management required with 
confidence and support.
Key recommendations for addressing support for 
women and girls in LMIC around vaginal bleeding in 
the future include the following: (1) a need to system-
atically evaluate the empirical evidence on vaginal 
bleeding to understand the extent to which women and 
girls are impacted and the gaps that need to be addressed 
with further research; (2) a need to develop global and 
national policy and strategic plans with guidelines to 
address these needs and develop relevant programming 
in LMIC, ranging from health promotion to improved 
availability of WASH infrastructure and supplies; (3) a 
need to conduct research with girls and women who 
experience vaginal bleeding unrelated to menstruation 
to understand their needs and how these needs may 
align with or differ from those at menstruation; (4) a 
need to ensure efforts to strengthen health systems and 
health worker capacity to improve women’s health as 
part of the post-2015 agenda actively address vaginal 
bleeding, which may be a symptom of greater health 
problems; (5) a need to expand ‘awareness campaigns’ 
for bleeding-related signs and symptoms of disease in 
LMIC; and (6) a need to engage new actors, including 
encouraging sanitary hygiene manufacturers to include 
easy to read information on difference between normal 
and abnormal bleeding, and when to seek care.
