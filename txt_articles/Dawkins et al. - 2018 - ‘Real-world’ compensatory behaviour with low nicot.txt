ABSTRACT
Aims
To compare the effects of (i) high versus low nicotine concentration e-liquid, (ii) fixed versus adjustable power and
(iii) the interaction between the two on: (a) vaping behaviour, (b) subjective effects, (c) nicotine intake and (d) exposure to
acrolein and formaldehyde in e-cigarette users vaping in their everyday setting. Design
Counterbalanced, repeated mea-
sures with four conditions: (i) low nicotine (6 mg/ml)/fixed power; (ii) low nicotine/adjustable power; (iii) high nicotine
(18 mg/ml)/fixed power; and (iv) high nicotine/adjustable power. Setting
London and the South East, England.
Participants
Twenty experienced e-cigarette users (recruited between September 2016 and February 2017) vaped ad
libitum using an eVic Supreme™ with a ‘Nautilus Aspire’ tank over 4 weeks (1 week per condition).
Measurements
Puffing patterns [daily puff number (PN), puff duration (PD), interpuff interval (IPI)], ml of e-liquid
consumed, changes to power (where permitted) and subjective effects (urge to vape, nicotine withdrawal symptoms)
were measured in each condition. Nicotine intake was measured via salivary cotinine. 3-Hydroxypropylmercapturic acid
(3-HPMA), a metabolite of the toxicant acrolein, and formate, a metabolite of the carcinogen formaldehyde, were mea-
sured in urine. Findings
There was a significant nicotine concentration × power interaction for PD (P < 0.01). PD
was longer with low nicotine/fixed power compared with (i) high nicotine/fixed power (P < 0.001) and (ii) low
nicotine/adjustable power (P < 0.01). PN and liquid consumed were higher in the low versus high nicotine condition
(main effect of nicotine, P < 0.05). Urge to vape and withdrawal symptoms were lower, and nicotine intake was higher,
in the high nicotine condition (main effects of nicotine: P < 0.01). While acrolein levels did not differ, there was a signif-
icant nicotine × power interaction for formaldehyde (P < 0.05). Conclusions
Use of a lower nicotine concentration
e-liquid may be associated with compensatory behaviour (e.g. higher number and duration of puffs) and increases in
negative affect, urge to vape and formaldehyde exposure.

INTRODUCTION
Awareness and use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)
has increased rapidly during recent years, with an esti-
mated 23.1 million smokers in the European Union (EU)
reporting ever trying an e-cigarette in 2012 [1] and 12.9
million people using e-cigarettes in the United States in
2014 [2]. In the United Kingdom, an estimated 2.9 million
people currently use e-cigarettes and, for the first time, in
2017 there were more ex-smokers using e-cigarettes
(52%) than dual users (45% [3]). The most commonly
cited reason for use is to quit smoking, and increasing evi-
dence suggests that e-cigarette use may be an effective tool
for this [4–6].
Nicotine delivery from e-cigarettes varies considerably,
and depends upon a variety of factors: the nicotine

 concentration in the e-liquid [7], the type and power of the
deviceandsettings[8–10]aswellasusercharacteristics,in-
cluding puffing patterns [9,11,12]. Over time, e-cigarette
users (vapers) tend to lower the nicotine concentration in
their e-liquid [13,14]. This may be due to: the belief that it
is healthier; to allow changes to the device/tank (e.g. sub-
ohming—using an atomizer coil with a resistance of < 1
Ohm with increased power); or to wean off e-cigarette/
nicotine use entirely. However, a reduction in nicotine in-
take may not actually followa reduction in nicotine e-liquid
concentration if users engage in compensatory puffing,
such as increasing the total puff number or taking longer
puffs [12,15]. In fact, in 98 vapers tested at baseline and
8 months later, while average nicotine concentration in
e-liquid decreased from 11 to 6 mg/ml, salivary cotinine
levels remained stable [13]. Hence, vapers may self-titrate
toalevelofsatisfactionwhichisoptimaltotheir needswhen
adjusting to a lower nicotine concentration e-liquid.
Compensatory puffing behaviour is seen in tobacco
smoking [16–19], with smokers achieving 60–80% of
their optimal nicotine levels by engaging in this practice
(i.e. by taking longer, larger volume and more frequent
puffs) when switching to lower nicotine yield cigarettes
[20]. To date, there have only been a few studies
on compensatory puffing in e-cigarette use. Ramoa
et al. [15] reported longer and deeper puffs in vapers using
a 0- compared with a 36-mg/ml nicotine e-liquid and, in a
small laboratory-based study (n = 11), Dawkins et al. [12]
observed compensatory behaviour in vapers using 6 com-
pared with 24 mg/ml e-liquid via more frequent and longer
puffs, resulting in a doubling of e-liquid consumed. In a
very recent report, compensatory puffing (increased puff
number and puff duration) was also observed when device
power was set at 6 W compared with 10 W [21]. Aside
from puffing behaviour, vapers may engage in other forms
of compensatory behaviour by adjusting the settings on the
device itself. Newer-generation devices now commonly
house a control head allowing air-flow, voltage or wattage
to be adjusted. Anecdotal reports suggest that use of lower
nicotine concentration e-liquids is accompanied by a lower
atomizer resistance and upward voltage or wattage adjust-
ment. This increases the overall power output of the device
which, in turn, increases aerosol production. This form of
behaviour compensation, however, has received no atten-
tion in the extant empirical literature.
Compensatory behaviour, including more frequent and
longer puffs and increasing power, can increase the tem-
perature of the coil at which glycerine and propylene glycol
(solvents used in e-liquids) undergo decomposition to car-
bonyl compounds [22]. This, in turn, may increase expo-
sure to carcinogens such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde
and acrolein. Four studies have explored biomarker levels
in human vapers’ saliva or urine, and have reported a more
favourable toxicity profile than for tobacco smokers under
normal usage conditions for polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (P
AHs), tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) and
other carcinogens, including acrolein [23]. Reduced
TSNAs, P
AHs and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have
also been found in smokers who switched to vaping over a
2–4-week period compared to those who continued
smoking while nicotine exposure remained unchanged
[24,25]. In a recent study comparing tobacco smokers
with e-cigarette-only and nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT)-only users, carcinogens and toxicants (TSNAs,
VOC) were lower in both e-cigarette and NRT users com-
pared with tobacco smokers [26]. To date, no studies have
explored biomarkers of exposure to the known human
carcinogen formaldehyde or explored the effect of compen-
satory behaviour on carcinogen exposure.
The paucity of research on compensatory behaviour in
e-cigarette use makes it difficult to generate clear
evidenced-based health messages which can inform the
public on the possible subjective, biological and toxicant ef-
fects of increased usage. Currently, the laboratory-based
studies provide some evidence of compensatory puffing,
but these have used restrictive behavioural parameters
which may not reflect true user behaviour. In reality,
vapers are likely to adjust the power (wattage) on their de-
vices (where device type allows) when switching to lower
nicotine concentration e-liquids according to personal
preference and current needs. Vapers can adjust the power
either by increasing battery output voltage or replacing the
atomizer with a heating element of lower resistance (for
example in ‘sub-ohming’). In most cases, given that the
atomizer resistance stays the same, by increasing voltage
vapers are increasing the overall power (wattage) of the
device.
In the present study, participants vaped ad libitum using
an eVic Supreme™ with a ‘Nautilus Aspire’ tank over
4 weeks (1 week per conditions): (i) low nicotine (6 mg/
ml)/fixed
power;
(ii)
low
nicotine/adjustable
power;
(iii) high nicotine (18 mg/ml)/fixed power; and (iv) high
nicotine/adjustable power. Although it was the voltage
rather than the wattage that participants adjusted, given
that the atomizer resistance remained the same, increasing
voltage results in an overall power increase, hence we refer
to changes to power throughout. The aims were: (1) to
compare the effects of nicotine concentration and power
setting on: (a) puffing behaviour [puff number, puff dura-
tion, interpuff interval (IPI)]; (2) product use (e-liquid con-
sumed and voltage adjustment); (b) subjective effects (urge
to vape, nicotine withdrawal symptoms and positive and
negative effects); and (c) nicotine delivery, acrolein and
formaldehyde exposure. We hypothesized significant nico-
tine concentration × power interactions; i.e. the lower nic-
otine concentration e-liquid, especially in combination
with adjustable power, would be associated with compen-
satory behaviour [increased puff number, longer puff

METHODS
Design and ethical approval
The study was approved by London South Bank University
ethics committee (UREC 1604) and conducted in accor-
dance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration
of Helsinki. Participants provided written informed consent
to take part and for the study to be written up for publica-
tion. A randomized, within-participants counterbalanced
design with four conditions (low nicotine/fixed power; high
nicotine/fixed power; low nicotine/adjustable power; high
nicotine/adjustable power) was used. Twenty-two partici-
pants were recruited via social media and university adver-
tising between September 2016 and February 2017. Two
withdrew during week 1 but, as per protocol [27], we con-
tinued to recruit until 20 participants had completed all
four conditions. Participants were asked to vape ad libitum
using an eVic Supreme™ with a ‘Nautilus Aspire’ tank over
4 weeks (1 week per condition). The sample size was based
on puff number and puff duration results from our pilot
study and from Dawkins et al. [12], where effect sizes of be-
tween d = 0.74 and d = 0.79 were found for puff number
and between d = 0.84 and d = 1.09 for puff duration. A
sample of between 14 and 19 for puff number and between
11 and 17 for puff duration would allow us to detect effects
at P < 0.05 with more than 90% power.
Procedure
The published protocol describes the procedure and mea-
sures in detail [27]. Participants were eligible to participate
if they were: aged 18+; experienced and exclusive daily
e-cigarette users (daily use for > 3 months); currently
using a second- or third-generation e-cigarette; using
≥ 12 mg/ml nicotine concentration e-liquid (to ensure par-
ticipants were familiar with higher levels of nicotine) or
sub-ohming (any nicotine level); non-smokers as con-
firmed by carbon monoxide (CO) levels in expired breath
of ≤ 10 parts per million (p.p.m.) We excluded pregnant
or lactating females, current smokers or users of marijuana
or other illicit drugs and those with a serious medical con-
dition (self-reported). Participants met with the researcher
on five separate occasions (at baseline and the end of each
of the four experimental conditions). At baseline partici-
pants provided written informed consent, demographic
characteristics and smoking/vaping history then sampled
four e-liquids (tobacco, fruit, bakery and menthol),
selecting one to be used for the next 4 weeks. Participants
were provided with an eVic Supreme™ by Joytech fitted
with a ‘Nautilus Aspire’ tank housing a BVC atomizer
(1.6 Ohm) and seven 10-ml bottles of e-liquid for the week
(6 or 18 mg/ml according to condition).
For each puff, the eVic records: time of the puff, puff
length (in seconds), atomizer resistance, voltage and watt-
age. To ensure device familiarity before changes were per-
mitted, the first 2 weeks were always fixed at 4.0 V
(10 W) with the widest air-flow setting on the tank.
Changes to voltage and airflow were permitted during the
last 2 weeks. Participants could adjust the airflow by turn-
ing a horizontal dial on the tank. However, no changes to
airflow were made, so this is not reported further. Voltage
could be adjusted (between 3.0 and 6.0 V) by turning a dial
under the display unit on the eVic. Given that the atomizer
resistance was fixed at 1.6 Ohm, adjusting the voltage up-
wards results in increased wattage (overall power output).
Participants were assigned randomly to start on either 6 or
18 mg/ml nicotine concentration e-liquid, giving rise to
four possible orders. Participants were instructed to refrain
from using their own devices and e-liquids for the duration
of the study.
At baseline and each follow-up time-point, breath CO
samples were taken (to confirm that participants had not
smoked recently) and saliva and urine were provided and
sent to Advanced Bioanalytical Service (ABS) Laboratories
Ltd (Welwyn Garden City, UK), where they were frozen at
�20° until assayed. Saliva was assayed for cotinine [28]
to determine nicotine intake. Urine was assayed for
3-HPMA to estimate acrolein exposure [24] and formate
for formaldehyde exposure [29]. Both were adjusted for
creatinine concentration.
At all five visits, participants reported their urge to vape,
withdrawal symptoms and positive and negative effects
during the last week. At the end of each condition, puffing
and power data were downloaded from the device using
myVapor™ software. Volume of e-liquid used was recorded
based on participant self-report. At the end of the study
participants were debriefed, thanked for their participation
and compensated £60 for their time and travel.
Measures
Demographic and smoking- and vaping-related informa-
tion was collected at baseline, including: length of time
since quitting smoking; e-cigarette device used; estimated
daily volume of e-liquid consumed; nicotine concentrations
used; self-rated addiction to e-cigarettes (0–100%); and
e-cigarette dependence (measured using the Penn State
E-cigarette Dependence Index) [30].
At all five visits, participants completed a modified ver-
sion of the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale [31] for
urge to vape and nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Time
spent with urges during the past week was rated from
0 = not at all to 5 = all the time; strength of urges were
rated from 0 = no urges to 5 = extremely strong and

 withdrawal symptoms were rated from 1 = not at all to
5 = extremely. Positive (e.g. hit, satisfaction) and negative
(nausea, headache) effects were rated on visual analogue
scales (V
AS) ranging from 0–100% [11].
Data analysis
Puffing topography and user behaviour
Data from the first/last day of each condition were ex-
cluded from analysis as (a) user behaviour on the first
day is likely to reflect familiarity and adjustment to the
device; and (b) these represented condition change-over
days. Puffing data were screened and all button presses
< 1 second (false button presses or non-starts) were de-
leted. Puffing data from one participant were lost due to
a problem with the device. The mean number of days per
condition was 6, but due to appointment re-arrangements,
occasional use of own device or days of non-use (due to
flights, hospital admission), this ranged from 4 to 13. Aver-
ages (mean for voltage, daily puff number, puff duration
and liquid consumption and median for IPI) for each con-
dition were computed by summing the data points for that
variable and dividing by the number of compliant days in
that condition.
Data were analysed using SPSS version 21. Distribu-
tions for most variables were normal, although withdrawal
symptoms, negative effects, 3-HPMA and formate were
positively skewed. Repeated-measures analyses of variance
(ANOV
A) with nicotine concentration (6 versus 18 mg/ml)
and power type [fixed (F) versus adjustable (A)] were con-
ducted for each variable (except voltage, which was fixed
in two of four conditions). Order of testing was added as
an additional between-subjects variable, but is mentioned
only where a significant main effect or interaction was
found. The accepted alpha level was P < 0.05. Where sig-
nificant nicotine × power interactions were found, post-hoc
paired-sample t-tests were conducted (for 6F versus 6A;
18F versus 18A; 6F versus 18A and 6Aversus 18A, as ap-
propriate). The alpha level for post-hoc tests was subjected
to a Bonferroni adjustment (0.05/4); the accepted alpha
level was therefore 0.01. ANOV
A results for the interaction
and main effects of nicotine concentration and power are
displayed in Table 2. Post-hoc test statistics and any order
effects are included in the text below.
RESULTS
Participants’ characteristics are shown in Table 1. On aver-
age, participants had quit smoking for 26 months, had a
mean score of 12.05 on the Penn State E-cigarette Depen-
dence Index and used a mean of 6.57 ml of e-liquid a day.
Baseline salivary cotinine levels ranged from 39 to
719 ng/ml.
Puffing topography
Puffing topography data for each condition are presented
in Table 2 (individual puffing patterns are available in the
Supporting information).
Puff number
The nicotine × power interaction was not statistically sig-
nificant, but there was a main effect of nicotine with a
higher puff number in the 6 versus 18 mg/ml nicotine
condition.
Puff duration
There was a significant nicotine concentration × power in-
teraction. Puff duration was significantly longer with 6
compared with 18 mg/ml nicotine e-liquid in the fixed
power condition [6F versus 18F: t18 = 5.26, P = 0.000,
mean difference = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = –
0.51 to 1.19) and longer with 6 fixed versus 6 adjustable
power (t18 = 3.15, P = 0.006, mean difference = 0.66,
95% CI = 0.22–1.09). There was also a significant set-
ting × order interaction (F3,15 = 4.61, P = 0.02, ηp
2 = 0.48),
with those starting and finishing on 6 mg/ml demonstrat-
ing a shorter puff duration when settings were adjustable.
IPI
IPI was calculated from information on puff timings in
each condition. The median, rather than mean, IPI was
taken due to the highly skewed data which included long
periods of inactivity/non-use (due presumably to sleeping
or working where vaping is not permitted). IPI could not
be calculated for some conditions for two participants due
to corrupted data files which distorted puff times.
The nicotine × power interaction was statistically sig-
nificant. Inspection of Table 2 reveals that IPI was shortest
under the 6 mg/ml fixed condition and was similar under
all other conditions. These differences however, fell short
of statistical significance in post-hoc tests.
Product use
E-liquid consumption
There was no nicotine × power interaction, although a
significantly greater volume (ml) of e-liquid per day was
consumed in the 6 versus 18 mg/ml nicotine condition
(main effect of nicotine).
Changes to power setting (voltage)
When participants were permitted to adjust the power,
compared to the fixed 4 V (10 W) condition, 13 increased
the voltage, two made no changes and four decreased it in
the 6 mg/ml nicotine condition. In the 18 mg/ml nicotine
condition, six increased the voltage, five made no changes
and seven decreased it. Overall, mean voltage was higher

 in the adjustable [mean = 4.39, standard deviation
(SD) = 0.75] compared with the fixed (4 V) power
condition; participants increased the voltage by a mean
of 0.5 v (95% CI = 0.17–0.84) in the low nicotine
condition and 0.3 v (95% CI = 0.12–0.65) in the high
condition.
Subjective effects
Mean scores for subjective effects in each condition are
presented in Table 2.
Urge to vape
Although there was no significant nicotine concentra-
tion × power interaction for either urge to vape or strength
of urges, both were significantly higher in the 6 compared
with the 18 mg/ml nicotine condition (main effect of
nicotine).
Withdrawal symptoms
The nicotine × power interaction was not statistically sig-
nificant, although nicotine withdrawal symptoms were
higher in the 6 versus 18 mg/ml condition (main effect of
nicotine) and in the fixed versus adjustable power condi-
tion (main effect of power).
Positive effects
There was a significant nicotine × power interaction for
positive effects. Post-hoc tests revealed that positive effects
were lower in the 6 versus the 18 mg/ml nicotine condition
under fixed power (6F versus 18F: t19 = �2.96, P = 0.008,
mean difference = �11.93, 95% CI = �20.38 to �3.49)
and lower under 6F compared with 6A (t19 = �3.74,
P = 0.001, mean difference = �13.14, 95% CI = �20.49
to �5.79).
Negative effects
Self-reported adverse effects were very low across condi-
tions and there was no significant nicotine × power inter-
action. There was a significant main effect of power, with
higher ratings of adverse effects in the fixed versus the ad-
justable power condition.

 Biomarkers analysis
Results of the biomarker analyses are presented in Table 2.
Nicotine delivery (salivary cotinine)
The interaction between nicotine concentration and power
was not statistically significant, but there was a main effect
of nicotine with higher salivary cotinine levels in the
18 mg/ml compared with the 6 mg/ml nicotine condition.
There was also a significant main effect of order, with those
receiving 18 mg/ml first achieving higher overall cotinine
levels (F3,15 = 6.54, P = 0.005, ηp
2 = 0.57).
Acrolein (3-HMPA) and formaldehyde (formate) exposure
Four urine samples were not received for analysis. For
3-HPMA there was no significant nicotine × power inter-
action or main effects. There was a significant nico-
tine × power interaction for formate; levels were higher
in the 6A condition compared with all other conditions, al-
though these differences were not statistically significant in
post-hoc t-tests. As the 3-HPMA and formate variables were
positively skewed by a few extreme high scores, the analysis
was repeated with outliers removed (six in each case). The
results remained unchanged for 3-HPMA. For formate the
interaction
remained
significant
(F1,12
=
13.33,
P = 0.003, ηp
2 = 0.53) and post-hoc tests revealed a signifi-
cant difference between 6A and 18A (t12 = 3.16,
P = 0.008, mean difference = 4.93, 95% CI = 1.53–
8.33), although the 6A versus 6F difference fell short of
the adjusted level of significance (t12 = �2.41, P = 0.03,
mean difference = �2.77, 95% CI = �5.27 to –0.27).
DISCUSSION
Our study is the first to document real-world compensatory
behaviour (puffing patterns and changes to power) with
low nicotine concentration e-liquid and to explore the ef-
fects on nicotine intake and toxicant/carcinogen exposure.
Consistent with our hypothesis and earlier laboratory
study [12], participants increased their puff number
and puff duration, decreased their IPI and consumed more
e-liquid in the low (6 mg/ml) compared with the high
(18 mg/ml) nicotine condition. The effect of nicotine on
puff duration was more pronounced when power settings
were fixed. Despite this evidence of compensatory behav-
iour, nicotine intake (measured via salivary cotinine)
remained higher in the high nicotine condition. Urge to
vape and nicotine withdrawal symptoms were higher and
positive effects were lower in the low nicotine condition,
particularly when the power was fixed. When changes to
power settings were permitted, participants increased the
voltage to a greater extent in the low compared with the
high nicotine condition. While acrolein levels did not differ
across conditions, formaldehyde exposure was higher in
the low nicotine, adjustable power condition. Overall our
findings add to the evidence base supporting compensatory
behaviour with lower nicotine concentration e-liquid,
which results in reduced positive subjective effects and
may increase formaldehyde exposure.
Our puffing topography findings are consistent with
our earlier laboratory-based study which also found
increased puff number and puff duration with a lower nic-
otine concentration e-liquid [12], supporting the notion
that, as with tobacco smokers, vapers engage in compensa-
tory puffing in an attempt to self-titrate with a lower nico-
tine concentration e-liquid. We also permitted changes to
power settings to reflect how experienced vapers using
newer-generation devices behave in real-world conditions.
Participants were more likely to increase the power in the
low nicotine condition, resulting in a shorter puff duration
(but no change to puff number) compared with fixed power
settings. Nevertheless, nicotine intake remained higher in
the high nicotine condition regardless of whether or not
power was fixed, suggesting that compensatory puffing
and changes to power were not adequate to raise nicotine
intake to the level achieved via a high (18 mg/ml) nicotine
e-liquid concentration. In fact, baseline salivary cotinine
levels fell roughly mid-point between the levels achieved
in the high and low nicotine conditions suggesting that,
as with tobacco smoking and with vapers in our earlier
study, upwards and downwards self-titration is incomplete
[12,16,32].
In relation to subjective effects, urge to vape, strength of
urges and withdrawal symptoms were higher, and positive
effects were lower, in the low nicotine condition. Although
urge to vape was unaffected by changes to power-settings,
withdrawal symptoms and positive effects were improved,
suggesting that increasing the power to the battery can im-
prove the subjective experience when using a lower nico-
tine concentration e-liquid. Nevertheless, although the
device used here, as with many newer-generation devices,
allows adjustment to the power, many standard cigalike
and second-generation devices do not. Our sample were
experienced vapers, many of whom reported sub-ohming
(of the whole sample: 40% daily; 75% occasionally) and
were therefore familiar with changing device settings. In
the absence of knowledge or mechanisms to adjust power,
our findings suggest that a lower nicotine concentration
e-liquid is associated with higher urges and withdrawal
symptoms and reduced overall satisfaction.
Levels of 3-HPMA did not differ across nicotine or power
conditions and were within the range found in exclusive
e-cigarette users in other studies [23,25], although slightly
higher than those reported by Shahab et al. [26]. To our
knowledge, we are the first to measure formate as an esti-
mate of formaldehyde exposure, a known human carcino-
gen [33] in e-cigarette users. Levels of formate were higher
in the low versus the high nicotine condition, particularly

 when users were permitted to adjust the power. These find-
ings are consistent with our previous report of increased
formaldehyde in e-cigarette aerosol generated using a more
intensive puffing regimen [34]. Although these results are
suggestive of an effect of compensatory behaviour on form-
aldehyde exposure, they are by no means conclusive; the
sample size was small and the influence of other foods
and drugs (not measured here) known to influence formal-
dehyde exposure cannot be ruled out.
Our study has several limitations. Although partici-
pants were not aware of the study aims, they were not
blinded to the nicotine e-liquid concentration which may
have influenced their puffing patterns and subjective
reporting. In terms of compliance, reports of using
non-study devices was reported occasionally and days of
non-use occurred (e.g. during a flight or hospital admis-
sion). Although these days were removed from the puffing
analysis, this could have influenced the biomarkers analy-
sis. Occasional smoking (including marijuana or hookah
use) may also have occurred; although CO levels were all
below 10 p.p.m., several were between 6 and 9 p.p.m.
and we did not have the resources to confirm lack of mar-
ijuana use biochemically. However, cross-referencing these
higher CO values against nicotine, 3-HPMA and formate
results did not reveal higher levels compared with the
rest of the sample. Our participants were all experienced
e-cigarette users, had vaped on average for 2 years and
40% were daily sub-ohmers. The puffing patterns and be-
haviour of these users may not therefore reflect the typical
vaper or smokers who have recently transitioned to vaping.
Finally, vapers are unlikely to transition directly from avery
high (18 mg/ml) to a very low (6 mg/ml) nicotine concen-
tration and in practice may move through an intermediate
stage (12 mg/ml). Whether smaller changes in nicotine
concentrations are associated with changes to puffing
topography and subjective effects is unknown.
In conclusion, use of a lower nicotine concentration
e-liquid is associated with compensatory puffing, reduced
subjective effects and, where permitted, increases to the
power of the device. Our findings suggest that this compen-
satory behaviour is not sufficient to fully compensate for
lower nicotine delivery and may be associated with in-
creased formaldehyde exposure. Switching to a lower nico-
tine concentration e-liquid may therefore be unsatisfying,
triggering
compensatory
behaviour
which
increases
e-liquid consumption and may increase health risks.
Although our formaldehyde findings require replication,
our data suggest that vapers should carefully consider
switching to lower nicotine concentration e-liquids.
