Abstract 
3 
The current study integrates men’s body attitudes with implicitly and explicitly measured 
4 
motivation to investigate the role of these factors in predicting gym attendance. Male 
5 
participants (N = 99) who regularly attended a gym were recruited to participate in an online 
6 
questionnaire. Participants completed implicit and explicit measures of motivation, explicitly-
7 
measured men’s body attitudes, and reported the average number of gym visits per week. 
8 
Attitudes related to body fat and explicitly-measured autonomous motivation significantly 
9 
predicted typical gym attendance. Implicitly-measured motivation significantly and 
10 
negatively predicted gym attendance. Results indicate some support for a dual-systems 
11 
account of gym attendance. Men’s body attitudes and autonomous motivation influences gym 
12 
attendance; however, implicitly-measured motivation showed antagonistic effects. While 
13 
individuals may explicitly state their autonomous motivation for gym attendance, attendance 
14 
may be influenced at the explicit level. Health and fitness professionals may improve gym 
15 
attendance by focusing on people’s reasons for attending a gym, facilitating autonomous 
16 
motivation in clients, and minimising the influence of controlled reasons for exercise.

INTRODUCTION 
2 
A body of research has focused on how men’s attitudes towards their body influence 
3 
exercise-related behavior [1-5]. Men who experience dissatisfaction with their body are likely 
4 
to spend more time exercising and attend a gym more regularly [6]; however, the 
5 
motivational orientations of such gym-goers (i.e., the nature of the rationales behind engaging 
6 
in exercise at the gym) remains largely under investigated. The current research integrates 
7 
men’s body attitudes and motivation from a self-determination theory perspective [7] to 
8 
assess the relationship with gym attendance. In addition, a recent theoretical development in 
9 
self-determination theory incorporates implicit, non-conscious motivation, which can be 
10 
measured by an implicit association test [IAT; 8]. Incorporating both explicit and implicit 
11 
motivation measures can contribute to theory by examining the extent to which men who 
12 
attend the gym regularly do so due to impulsive, automatic motivation; or reflective, 
13 
conscious motivation. This is the first study, to the authors’ knowledge, to combine men’s 
14 
body attitudes with explicit and implicit measures of motivation. 
15 
A panoply of research outlines men’s desire to become more muscular and lower 
16 
their body fat [5, 9, 10]. Up to 95% of college-age males report being unhappy with their 
17 
body appearance, which may lead to body dysmorphia [11]. In order to better understand 
18 
men’s attitudes toward their body and how they influence exercise and dietary behaviors, 
19 
several scales have been developed. The male body attitudes scale [MBAS; 12] is one such 
20 
scale that reflects dimensions of male body dissatisfaction, based on theoretical and empirical 
21 
literature [13]. The MBAS outlines three dimensions related to muscularity, body fat, and 
22 
height and has been validated in recent research (Tylka et al., 2005). While the majority of 
23 
research has focused on the classification of body dissatisfaction [1, 2], less is known about 
24 
the relationship between motivation and attitudes  and their relation to gym attendance.

Research has shown that attitudes alone are unlikely to lead directly to behavior [14]; 
1 
and may be formed consistent with the qualities of an individual’s motivation towards 
2 
engaging in that behavior [15]. Accordingly,, researchers have included measures of 
3 
motivation to complement attitudinal constructs [e.g., 16]. Self-determination theory [SDT; 7, 
4 
17] is a meta-theory of human motivation that has been applied to a range of health-related 
5 
behaviors, such as physical activity and exercise [18]. Self-determination theory also 
6 
emphasises the role of the individual’s cognitions on the quality of motivation, which is 
7 
separated into autonomous and controlled forms of motivation. Individuals engaging in 
8 
behavior through a sense of volition or choice are autonomously motivated, and likely to feel 
9 
a sense of intrinsic enjoyment or satisfaction when carrying out that behavior [19]. 
10 
Autonomously motivated individuals are likely to persist with gym attendance without 
11 
external contingencies such as rewards or pressure. In contrast, individuals experiencing 
12 
controlled motivation perform behaviors for the attainment of external rewards (e.g., money, 
13 
recognition), or to avoid feelings related to self-esteem such as guilt or shame [20]. For 
14 
instance, males may feel guilty for missing or skipping gym sessions, and fear the outcomes 
15 
(e.g., gaining weight, losing physique). The majority of research using self-determination 
16 
theory has emphasised the need to support autonomy and facilitate autonomous motivation to 
17 
engage and persist in health behaviors [21-23]. However, while autonomous motivation is 
18 
considered important in behavioral engagement and persistence, controlled motivation may 
19 
continue to influence behavior when external or self-esteem-related contingencies remain. 
20 
For instance, individuals who feel ashamed of their body may attend a gym in order to see 
21 
physical results; as long as the perception (shame) regarding their body persists, so too will 
22 
the rationales for gym attendance [20]. 
23 
 
A further premise of SDT relates to individual differences in dispositional 
24 
motivational orientations. These orientations reflect relatively enduring, and distal influences 
25

4 
across a wide range of behaviors, and are outlined in the general causality orientations scale 
1 
[GCOS; 24]. For example, when receiving a promotion at work, an individual might think to 
2 
ask how much money they will make in their new role, reflecting a control orientation; or if 
3 
the new role will be challenging or enjoyable, reflecting an autonomy orientation [17]. 
4 
Recent research has identified that these orientations influence behavior at both explicit and 
5 
implicit levels [25, 26]. While several attempts have been made to measure implicit 
6 
motivation in relation to behavior [25, 27], the implicit association test [IAT; 8] has 
7 
increasingly used. A reaction time-based task, the motivation IAT paradigm suggests 
8 
individuals who hold autonomy orientations will respond quicker to the pairing of self (e.g., 
9 
‘me’) and autonomous (e.g., ‘freely’) words, than the pairing between self and controlled 
10 
(e.g., ‘forced) words. Conversely, individuals who hold exhibit control orientation at the 
11 
implicit level will sort the latter pairing (self and controlled), quicker. Through a number of 
12 
studies, Keatley and colleagues [24,25,29] have found implicitly-measured motivation  
13 
predicts engagement and performance across a range of health behaviors, including physical 
14 
activity. The current research extends these findings by investigating the role of implicit 
15 
motivation alongside other variables related to physical activity (e.g., gym attendance), such 
16 
as body attitudes. 
17 
In order to conceptualise the patterns of effects of explicit and implicit measures on 
18 
behavior, several dual-process or dual-systems models have been proposed [28, 29]. It is 
19 
important to measure implicit and explicit measures together in order to fully investigate the 
20 
patterns of effects between the two measures in predicting behaviour [30-33]. Both the 
21 
implicit and explicit measures may act synergistically or antagonistically to predict behaviour 
22 
[31]. For instance, an additive pattern suggests that both systems affect behaviour 
23 
independently; multiplicative patterns suggest the two measures interact to affect behaviour; 
24 
and double dissociative patterns suggest that implicit processes predicts unplanned 
25

5 
behaviours, while explicit processes better predict planned behaviours [31]. Only by taking 
1 
into account both implicit and explicit measures together, can we understand which patterns 
2 
is supported. In particular, Strack and Deutsch [28] developed the reflective-impulsive model 
3 
(RIM), which attempts to comprehensively and parsimoniously account for the role of 
4 
implicit, impulsive and explicit, reflective processes that influence behavior. In the RIM, the 
5 
reflective system is related to deliberative, planned behaviors, leading to intentions for future 
6 
states and goals. The impulsive system, in contrast, comprises processes that arise from the 
7 
reflective system or perceptual inputs and is underpinned by associative networks. To this 
8 
extent, explicit, self-report measures are proposed to provide an account of the reflective 
9 
system, while implicit measures, such as the IAT, are well-positioned to provide an account 
10 
of the associative networks. 
11 
 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of men’s body attitudes 
12 
alongside implicit and explicit motivation on gym attendance. We measured these influences 
13 
while controlling for body mass index (BMI). From this framework, a number of hypotheses 
14 
were derived. Based on previous research into men’s body attitudes and its effects on 
15 
behavior [13], we hypothesised that men with negative body attitudes would report greater 
16 
gym attendance (H1). We also hypothesised that explicit measures of motivation at the 
17 
proximal (i.e., Perceived Locus Of Causality) and distal (i.e., General Causality Orientations 
18 
Scale) levels would predict gym attendance (H2). Specifically, autonomous motivation would 
19 
predict attending the gym for reasons of choice and enjoyment, while controlled motivation 
20 
would reflect gym attendance due to extrinsic reasons or for reasons related to self-esteem. 
21 
This hypothesis was based on previous literature showing the relationship between types of 
22 
motivation and physical activity behaviors [34, 35]. Last, we hypothesized that implicit 
23 
motivation would predict gym attendance (H3), similar to explicit measures. This hypothesis 
24

is based on previous research showing the relation between implicit autonomous motivation 
1 
and physical activity [18, 36].

METHODS 
3 
Approach to the problem 
4 
 
The current study was a cross-sectional study using online resources to measure 
5 
participants’ body attitudes and motivation types. The variables and types of measure were 
6 
carefully selected based on their precedence in the literature as well as their suitability for 
7 
answering the research questions.  
8 
Subjects 
9 
A total of 100 male participants (Mage = 30.40, SD = 11.10) participated in the study, 
10 
with an average BMI for the sample was 25.83 (SD = 6.62). The majority of the sample 
11 
(57.3%) endorsed health and fitness as their primary reason for attending a gym or fitness 
12 
centre, following by appearance (16.7%), amateur body building (16.7%), training or 
13 
competing (8.3%), and other (1%). Participants reported an average gym or fitness centre 
14 
attendance of 2.46 (SD = 1.71) sessions per week, typically lasting 1.06 (SD = .742) hours. 
15 
We used the Borg Scale [37] to measure typical gym or fitness centre exertion, multiplying 
16 
scores by 10 to approximate heart beats per minute during routines (M = 124.1 [fairly light to 
17 
somewhat hard]; SD = 87.1; Median = 130). All participant data were entered into analyses, 
18 
save for one participant who did not provide data for gym attendance (N = 99). Ethical 
19 
approval was granted by the [name omitted] university ethics committee. Individuals were 
20 
eligible to participate in the study if they were male, fluent English speakers, and attended a 
21 
gym or fitness centre frequently.

before advancing to the questionnaire. The order of presentation of the measures was 
1 
randomised, such that participants received either the IAT before or after the questionnaires. 
2 
The order of scales in the questionnaire was also randomised. Participants progressed through 
3 
the questionnaires at their own pace, which lasted approximately 25 minutes. Completion of 
4 
the IAT took approximately five minutes. All participants were given a $2 USD 
5 
inconvenience allowance for participating. While the IAT was administered online, it is set-
6 
up to download and run using participants’ own operating system; therefore, there were no 
7 
issues relating to lag or internet speeds. 
8 
Measures. The revised male body attitudes scale (MBAS-R)1 incorporates some 
9 
revisions to the original MBAS by Tylka et al. [13], measuring men’s attitudes towards their 
10 
body fat and muscularity. As we were interested in men’s attitudes towards their body that 
11 
could be targeted by attending a gym or fitness centre, we included only the body fat and 
12 
muscularity subscales of the MBAS-R2. Participants responded to a series of statements 
13 
regarding body fat (e.g., seeing my reflection [e.g., in a mirror or window] makes me feel 
14 
badly about my body fat) and muscularity (e.g., I think my arms should be more muscular) on 
15 
a six-point scale from I (never) to 6 (always). Cronbach’s α values for the subscale scores for 
16 
the total muscle (MBASMusc) and body fat (MBASBF) were .87 and .89, respectively.  
17 
The perceived locus of causality (PLOC) was adapted to apply to motivation related 
18 
to attending the gym or fitness centre to exercise and work out. Participants evaluated a series 
19 
of statements reflective of their underlying motivational regulations (e.g., “I feel under 
20 
pressure to exercise or work out regularly from people I know well”) using a scale from 1 
21 
(“not true at all”) to 4 (“very true”). Weighted means were calculated for the resulting PLOC 
22 
                                                           
1 The original MBAS 12. Tylka, T.L., D. Bergeron, and J.P. Schwartz, Development and psychometric 
evaluation of the Male Body Attitudes Scale (MBAS). Body Image, 2005. 2(2): p. 161-175. was also tested in the 
regression models and a similar pattern of results were found. In keeping with developments in the literature, we 
report the revised version in the current article; alternative results using the original MBAS are available from 
the first author, on request.

scores according to previous research to create scales for autonomous motivation (i.e., 2 x 
1 
intrinsic motivation + identified regulation; Cronbach’s α = .83) and controlled motivation 
2 
(i.e., 2 x extrinsic regulation + introjected regulation; Cronbach’s α = .61)3.  
3 
The general causality orientations scale [24] measures individuals’ general or 
4 
dispositional motivation orientations, comprising a series of vignettes and associated responses 
5 
reflective of autonomous and controlled  motivational orientations. An example vignette refers to 
6 
receiving a new position at a company; participants indicate how likely they will respond by 
7 
thinking, “Will I make more at this position?” (i.e., control orientation; Cronbach’s α = .88), or, 
8 
“I wonder if the new work will be interesting?” (i.e., autonomy orientation; Cronbach’s = .71). 
9 
Participants rate the likelihood of responding in these ways on a seven-point Likert-type scale 
10 
from 1 (“very unlikely”) to 7 (“very likely”). There were 12 vignettes in total, each with two 
11 
statements, one pertaining to autonomy orientation, the other pertaining to control orientation. 
12 
 
Implicit autonomous and controlled motivation were measured with the motivational 
13 
IAT [25, 27, 36]. Words relating to autonomous motivation (i.e., Label: autonomous; stimuli: 
14 
choice, free, spontaneous, willing, authentic) and controlled motivation (Label: controlled; 
15 
stimuli: pressured, restricted, forced, should, controlled) have previously been used to show 
16 
distinct representations of the two motivation orientations. Participants were given 
17 
information on what the forms of motivation were, emphasising the differences between 
18 
them. Words relating to ‘self’ (I, me, my, mine, self) and ‘others’ (they, them, their, theirs, 
19 
others) were also adopted from previous research in the area [25, 27, 36]. The category 
20 
‘others’ was described to participants as reflecting ‘not-self’, to prevent comparison with a 
21 
generalised social-comparison group. The standard 5-step IAT was used, in which blocks 1, 
22 
2, and 4 comprised 20 practice trials, and blocks 3 and 5 comprised 60 trials (i.e., 20 practice, 
23 
40 test). The critical blocks were counterbalanced. The improved scoring algorithm [38] was 
24 
                                                           
3 While there is some debate regarding the structure of self-determination theory, and whether it is on a 
continuum [36], the current manuscript opted for the calculations shown here, in order to be parsimonious 
with existing literature in the area.

used to calculate the implicit motivation D-score, with positive scores reflecting an implicit 
1 
bias to autonomous and self word pairings. All participants’ M-IAT data met the inclusion 
2 
criteria, as detailed in the improved scoring algorithm [38].  
3 
 
Gym attending behavior was measured by asking participants indicate the average 
4 
number of times they attended the gym for a work-out or exercise session in a typical week. 
5 
This was used as the outcome variable.  
6 
RESULTS 
7 
Initial data screening for kurtosis and skewness indicated that data could be 
8 
considered normally distributed. Indicators showed no issue with multicollinearity in the 
9 
dataset. Descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations between study variables are shown 
10 
in Table 1. Participants’ average gym sessions per week correlated significantly with 
11 
perceived locus of causality autonomous motivation (r = .52, p < .001) and controlled 
12 
motivation (r = .31, p < .001). Male body attitudes related to muscle (r = .21, p = .03) and 
13 
body fat (r = .22, p = .03) were also significantly correlated. Finally, implicit motivation was 
14 
not correlated with average gym sessions per week (r = -.14, p = .18). 
15 
Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to assess the unique contribution of 
16 
predictors to gym attendance. Body mass index was entered in the first step. In the second 
17 
step, motivation (i.e., PLOCAut, PLOCCon, GCOSAut, GCOSCon, and M-IAT) and male body 
18 
attitudes (i.e., MBASBF and MBASmus ) were entered. Standardised beta coefficients and 
19 
statistics related to the regression analysis are included in Table 2. Body mass index did not 
20 
significantly predict gym attendance in the first step, Adj. R2 = -.01, p = .97,  F(1, 87) = .002, 
21 
p = .97. The inclusion of the predictor variables on gym attendance in the second step led to a 
22 
significant increase in variance accounted for:  Adj. R2 = .35, p <.001; F (8, 87) = 6.87, p < 
23 
.001; ∆R2 = .41, p < .001, with BMI remaining a non-significant predictor (β = -.09, p = .45). 
24 
Average gym sessions per week were significantly predicted by MBASBF (β = .32, p = .01), 
25

10 
but not MBASmus, providing partial support for H1. The PLOCAut significantly predicted 
1 
average number of gym sessions per week (β = .56, p < .001), although prediction by 
2 
PLOCCon was non-significant (β = -.07, p = .51); GCOS variables were similarly non-
3 
significant, indicating partial support for H2. . Implicitly measured motivation significantly 
4 
and negatively predicted average number of gym sessions per week (β = -.21, p = .03), 
5 
supporting hypothesis (H3)4. 
6 
DISCUSSION 
7 
The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of men’s attitudes toward 
8 
their body alongside their implicit and explicit motivation in relation to the number of times 
9 
they attend a gym, per week. The research adopted a dual-systems framework to 
10 
conceptualise the patterns of prediction between men’s body attitudes, alongside explicit and 
11 
implicit measures of motivation. A series of hypotheses based on previous literature in the 
12 
area were systematically tested. The first hypothesis (H1) related to the effect of negative 
13 
body attitudes toward muscle mass and body fat, as measured by the male body attitudes 
14 
scale (MBAS). The current research provided partial support for this hypothesis, indicating 
15 
that men with higher negative views toward their body fat also reported greater average gym 
16 
attendance per week. Considering that body mass index (our control variable) was not a 
17 
significant predictor of gym attendance, it may mean that individuals attend the gym due to 
18 
subjective perceptions of body weight (as measured by the MBAS), rather than actual body 
19 
weight (as measured by the BMI). Given that attitudes towards muscle did not significantly 
20 
predict gym attendance, it may be that the current sample was more motivated to attend the 
21 
gym due to perceptions of body fat, rather than muscle mass. It should be noted, however, 
22 
that participants in the current sample were slightly overweight in terms of their BMI. 
23 
                                                           
4 Interaction terms between explicit generalised measures of motivation (GCOS) and the implicit measure of 
motivation were entered into the third step of the regression model, in additional analyses. These, however, were 
not significant predictors of behaviour and are therefore omitted. Full analyses are available from the 
correspondent author, on request.

Notwithstanding these limitations, the present results may suggest that males with higher 
1 
BMI place more emphasis on weight loss than muscle gain, which is an important 
2 
consideration for health and exercise professionals in terms of focusing interventions, in that 
3 
individuals with higher BMI may be more focused on weight-related issues than muscle. 
4 
 
A second hypothesis (H2) related to the role of explicit motivation types on gym 
5 
attendance. In the present study, context-specific autonomous motivation significantly 
6 
predicted higher gym attendance per week, supporting the link between autonomous 
7 
motivation to engage in physical activity and continued, persistent physical activity behavior 
8 
[22]. This means that individuals who choose to attend the gym with a sense of volition and 
9 
choice are more likely to attend more often. Though controlled motivation was significantly 
10 
correlated with gym sessions per week, it was not a significant predictor of gym attendance in 
11 
our regression analyses, and therefore the hypothesis was not fully supported. It should be 
12 
noted that controlled motivation (PLOC) was a relatively low alpha level in the current study; 
13 
however the scale has been widely used and supported in the literature and it is not 
14 
uncommon for research using these scales to report lower reliability for controlled motivation 
15 
[39, 40]. 
16 
Our final hypothesis (H3) related to implicit motivation, which was found to be a 
17 
significant negative predictor of gym attendance. In the current study, higher implicit 
18 
controlled motivation (i.e., indicated by negative D-scores) was predictive of gym attendance 
19 
as opposed to implicit autonomous motivation. These results indicate that unplanned gym 
20 
attendance may be predicted by implicit processes. In the present study, it is plausible that 
21 
unplanned opportunities to attend the gym are what the implicit measure is predicting, rather 
22 
than habitual responses. The reason for this is that the explicit measure of controlled 
23 
motivation was significantly correlated with gym attendance behavior, but did not show 
24 
significant independent association with gym attendance. Therefore, when planning and 
25

12 
reflecting on reasons to attend the gym (i.e., indicated by the PLOC), individuals are likely to 
1 
be influenced more by explicit autonomous motivations; when individuals do not plan or 
2 
form intentions to attend the gym (i.e., a time during the day in which attending a gym 
3 
becomes suddenly possible, see [32, 33]), implicit controlled motivation may be more 
4 
predictive of gym attendance. 
5 
The present research takes a novel approach in combining self-determination theory 
6 
with men’s attitudes towards their physical appearance for predicting self-reported gym 
7 
attendance. Although there is a large focus on body and muscle dissatisfaction, contemporary 
8 
theories of motivation have, to our knowledge, not yet been applied to further understand the 
9 
influence of differing types of motivation (i.e., controlled or autonomous) and body attitudes 
10 
on gym attendance. The comprehensive testing of the hypotheses through hierarchical 
11 
regression allowed the influence of motivational variables on gym attendance to be observed 
12 
while controlling for BMI. The measurement of motivation at the implicit level can be 
13 
considered a strength of the present study, in light of recent developments in self-
14 
determination theory. Although the Motivation IAT has been supported in various 
15 
applications throughout the literature, there remains a general lack of consensus regarding 
16 
which implicit test best represents influences from the impulsive system [41]. Future research 
17 
should seek to corroborate the present trend in the literature by including other implicit 
18 
measures, such as the single-category implicit association test [42], or the go/no-go 
19 
association task [43]. These measures allow for autonomous and controlled motivation to be 
20 
measured separately, which may clarify the antagonistic patterns of prediction between 
21 
autonomous and controlled motivation types. Furthermore, inclusion of explicit measures of 
22 
habitual behavior, such as the behavioral self-report automaticity indices [44] may also be 
23 
used to establish support for automatic or habitual gym attendance, alongside implicit 
24 
measures.

The present study carries some limitations that should be noted. Firstly, the sample 
1 
average BMI was slightly overweight, which may have influenced the responses on measures 
2 
of body attitude. The cross-sectional design can also be considered a limitation; although the 
3 
study was sufficiently powered, a prospective-correlational or longitudinal design that 
4 
establishes the effect of motivation on gym attendance over time may be a useful avenue for 
5 
future research. The self-reported nature of the scales should also be taken into consideration 
6 
when interpreting these results. Further research may endeavour to incorporate more 
7 
objective measurements of behavior (e.g., data from personal exercise tracking devices, gym 
8 
or fitness centre access logs). Lastly, as autonomous motivation is facilitated by the support 
9 
of psychological needs such as competence and relatedness, the influence of others (e.g., 
10 
personal trainers, gym partners) on individual motivation at the gym or fitness centre is an 
11 
important area for further research. 
12 
 
  
13 
 
In terms of practical recommendations emerging from the current research, findings 
14 
may help to guide health and exercise professionals (e.g., personal trainers, coaches) and 
15 
inform interventions by highlighting the roles of men’s body attitudes and different 
16 
motivation types in influencing gym attendance. Men with negative body attitudes may still 
17 
exhibit autonomous forms of motivation in relation to gym attendance. Therefore, the 
18 
provision of autonomy support that emphasises personally-relevant goals, and planned gym 
19 
attendance over time, whilst minimizing extrinsic, perhaps more fleeting pursuits, may be of 
20 
importance to establishing long-term positive health behavior change [45, 46]. Given the 
21 
poorer psychological and health outcomes associated with forms of controlled motivation 
22 
[20], trainers and coaches should shift focus from external appearance to more intrinsic 
23 
elements of exercise in the gym or fitness centre. The role of implicit, non-conscious 
24 
processes should also be taken into account. Given the indication that these processes may

influence spontaneous gym attendance and the associations between controlled motivation 
1 
and negative psychological outcomes, routines and action plans to reduce unplanned, 
2 
controlled reasons for attending the gym may be better [34]. 
3 
Practical Applications 
4 
 
Gym attendance for men may not always be about increasing muscle mass (i.e., the 
5 
muscular ideal); but, as was the case in this study, can also be driven by the desire to lose 
6 
weight. Autonomous motivation and implicit controlled motivation both positively predict 
7 
gym attendance, this suggests that health practitioners should encourage autonomous forms 
8 
of motivation, while maintaining awareness of the effects of, implicit controlled motivation – 
9 
that is, unplanned attendance potentially due to feelings of shame or guilt about their body 
10 
size and shape.
