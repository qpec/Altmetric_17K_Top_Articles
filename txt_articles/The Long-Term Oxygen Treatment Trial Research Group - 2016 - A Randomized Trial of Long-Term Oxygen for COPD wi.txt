BACKGROUND
Long-term treatment with supplemental oxygen has unknown efficacy in patients with 
stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and resting or exercise-induced 
moderate desaturation.
METHODS
We originally designed the trial to test whether long-term treatment with supplemental 
oxygen would result in a longer time to death than no use of supplemental oxygen among 
patients who had stable COPD with moderate resting desaturation (oxyhemoglobin satu-
ration as measured by pulse oximetry [Spo2], 89 to 93%). After 7 months and the ran-
domization of 34 patients, the trial was redesigned to also include patients who had 
stable COPD with moderate exercise-induced desaturation (during the 6-minute walk test, 
Spo2 ≥80% for ≥5 minutes and <90% for ≥10 seconds) and to incorporate the time to the 
first hospitalization for any cause into the new composite primary outcome. Patients were 
randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive long-term supplemental oxygen (supplemental-
oxygen group) or no long-term supplemental oxygen (no-supplemental-oxygen group). In the 
supplemental-oxygen group, patients with resting desaturation were prescribed 24-hour 
oxygen, and those with desaturation only during exercise were prescribed oxygen during 
exercise and sleep. The trial-group assignment was not masked.
RESULTS
A total of 738 patients at 42 centers were followed for 1 to 6 years. In a time-to-event 
analysis, we found no significant difference between the supplemental-oxygen group and 
the no-supplemental-oxygen group in the time to death or first hospitalization (hazard 
ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.12; P 
= 
0.52), nor in the rates of all 
hospitalizations (rate ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.13), COPD exacerbations (rate ratio, 
1.08; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.19), and COPD-related hospitalizations (rate ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 
0.83 to 1.17). We found no consistent between-group differences in measures of quality 
of life, lung function, and the distance walked in 6 minutes.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation, the 
prescription of long-term supplemental oxygen did not result in a longer time to death or 
first hospitalization than no long-term supplemental oxygen, nor did it provide sustained 
benefit with regard to any of the other measured outcomes. (Funded by the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
wo trials that were conducted in 
the 1970s showed that long-term treat-
ment with supplemental oxygen reduced 
mortality among patients with chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe resting 
hypoxemia.1,2 These results led to the recommen-
dation that supplemental oxygen be adminis-
tered to patients with an oxyhemoglobin satura-
tion, as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2), of less 
than 89%.3,4 In the 1990s, two trials evaluated 
long-term treatment with supplemental oxygen 
in patients with COPD who had mild-to-moderate 
daytime hypoxemia; neither trial showed a mor-
tality benefit, but both were underpowered to 
assess mortality.5,6 The effects of oxygen treat-
ment on hospitalization,7-9 exercise performance, 
and quality of life are unclear.10
Medicare reimbursements for oxygen-related 
costs for patients with COPD exceeded $2 billion 
in 2011.11 If long-term treatment with supple-
mental oxygen reduces the incidence of COPD-
related hospitalizations, increased use could be 
cost-effective. Reliable estimates of the number 
of prescriptions for supplemental oxygen that 
are written for the indication of exercise-induced 
desaturation are unavailable. Data suggest that 
many patients with advanced emphysema who 
are prescribed oxygen may not have severe rest-
ing hypoxemia.12
The Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT) 
was originally designed to test whether the use 
of supplemental oxygen would result in a longer 
time to death than no use of supplemental oxygen 
among patients with COPD and moderate resting 
desaturation (Spo2, 89 to 93%). After 7 months 
and the randomization of 34 patients, the trial 
design was judged to be infeasible owing to lower-
than-projected mortality and the phenotypic 
overlap between patients with moderate resting 
desaturation and those with exercise-induced de-
saturation. Accordingly, the investigators rede-
signed the trial to include patients with exercise-
induced desaturation and to incorporate the 
secondary outcome of hospitalization for any 
cause into the new composite primary outcome. 
Patients who underwent randomization under the 
original design continued in the redesigned trial.
The amended trial tested whether the use of 
supplemental oxygen resulted in a longer time to 
death or first hospitalization for any cause (com-
posite primary outcome) than no use of supple-
mental oxygen among patients with moderate 
resting desaturation or moderate exercise-induced 
desaturation. The original and amended trial 
protocols are available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org. Herein we report the pri-
mary and secondary outcomes and 11 of the 14 
other outcomes listed in the trial protocol (see the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org, 
for the reasons that 3 outcomes are not reported).
Methods
Design
We conducted this parallel-group, randomized 
clinical trial of long-term supplemental oxygen 
versus no long-term supplemental oxygen in 
patients with COPD and moderate resting or 
exercise-induced desaturation. Randomization 
was performed in a 1:1 ratio, and the trial-group 
assignment was not masked. The primary out-
come in the time-to-event analysis, measured 
from randomization, was the composite of death 
or first hospitalization. The protocol specified 
that the consistency of treatment effects would 
be tested in subgroups of patients that were de-
fined according to prespecified baseline charac-
teristics. The protocol and amendments were 
approved by the data and safety monitoring 
board for the trial and by the institutional re-
view board at each center. No materials were 
donated to this trial.
Patients
A total of 14 regional clinical centers and their 
associated sites (a total of 47 centers) screened 
patients who had stable COPD and moderate 
resting desaturation (Spo2, 89 to 93%) or moderate 
exercise-induced desaturation (during the 6-min-
ute walk test, Spo2 ≥80% for ≥5 minutes and 
<90% for ≥10 seconds). All the patients signed 
a contract in which they agreed not to smoke 
while using oxygen, and they provided written 
informed consent. Table S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix lists all the selection criteria.
Interventions
Patients in the supplemental-oxygen group were 
prescribed 24-hour oxygen if their resting Spo2 
was 89 to 93% and oxygen only during sleep and 
exercise if they had desaturation only during ex-
ercise. All the patients in the supplemental-oxygen

Long-Term Oxygen for COPD with Moderate Desaturation
group were prescribed stationary and portable 
oxygen systems and 2 liters of oxygen per minute 
during sleep. Patients in the supplemental-oxygen 
group who had been prescribed 24-hour oxygen 
were prescribed 2 liters of oxygen per minute at 
rest. The ambulatory dose of oxygen was individu-
ally prescribed and reassessed annually: 2 liters 
of oxygen per minute or adjusted higher to main-
tain an Spo2 of 90% or more for at least 2 minutes 
while the patient was walking. The protocol 
specified that patients in the supplemental- 
oxygen group continue the use of supplemental 
oxygen regardless of increase in the Spo2 level 
and that patients in the no-supplemental-oxygen 
group avoid the use of supplemental oxygen un-
less severe resting desaturation (Spo2 ≤88%) or 
severe exercise-induced desaturation (Spo2 <80% 
for ≥1 minute) developed. If either of these con-
ditions developed, oxygen was prescribed and the 
oxygen requirement was reassessed after 30 days.
Each patient in the supplemental-oxygen group 
spoke with an adherence educator regularly to 
discuss barriers to adherence to the assigned 
regimen and to report average daily use. Each 
patient in the group that received no long-term 
supplemental oxygen (no-supplemental-oxygen 
group) spoke with an adherence educator 1 week 
after randomization to discuss living without 
supplemental oxygen. Every 4 months, all the 
patients were asked about supplemental-oxygen 
use; those who reported some oxygen use were 
asked to estimate the average daily use. Patients 
in the supplemental-oxygen group who used 
stationary oxygen concentrators also kept logs 
of meter readings.
Outcomes
In addition to the composite primary outcome 
and its components, outcomes included the inci-
dence of COPD exacerbation, adherence to the 
supplemental-oxygen regimen, development of 
severe resting desaturation (as assessed by means 
of pulse oximetry), development of severe exer-
cise-induced desaturation (as assessed by means 
of pulse oximetry), the distance walked in 6 min-
utes, and scores on the Quality of Well-Being 
Scale (mean daily scores range from 0 to 1, with 
higher scores indicating better quality of life; 
minimum clinically important difference, 0.03)13,14 
and the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire 
(total scores range from 0 to 100, with higher 
scores indicating worse health-related quality 
of life; minimum clinically important difference, 
4).15,16 A total of 33 centers elected to obtain spi-
rometric measurements after randomization and 
to administer the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item 
Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; the summary 
scores for the physical and mental components 
each range from 0 to 100, with higher scores 
indicating better function; minimum clinically 
important difference, 5),17 the Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Scale (scores on each measure 
[anxiety or depression] range from 0 to 21, with 
higher scores indicating greater anxiety or de-
pression; minimum clinically important differ-
ence, 1.5),18,19 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index (total scores range from 0 to 21, with 
higher scores indicating worse sleep quality).20 
The protocol lists three additional outcomes 
(nutritional status, risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease, and neurocognitive function) that are not 
reported here.
Patients attended visits yearly after random-
ization, were interviewed by telephone twice 
yearly, and completed mailed questionnaires at 
4 months and 16 months (Table S2 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Details regarding the as-
certainment of the primary composite outcome 
and procedures for measuring resting and exercise-
induced desaturation are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
Calculation of the final required sample was 
based on a time–to–composite event survival 
model with the use of the log-rank test statistic. 
Assuming 90% power to detect a hazard ratio 
for death or first hospitalization of 0.60 in the 
supplemental-oxygen group versus the no-supple-
mental-oxygen group, a two-sided type I error 
rate of 0.05, an 11.7% overall crossover rate from 
the no-supplemental-oxygen group to the supple-
mental-oxygen group, and a 3.1% overall cross-
over rate from the supplemental-oxygen group 
to the no-supplemental-oxygen group, we calcu-
lated a sample size of 737 patients. The hazard 
ratio of 0.60 corresponds to the smallest differ-
ence in mortality that the investigators judged to 
be clinically worthwhile (a 40% lower rate in the 
supplemental-oxygen group than in the no-supple-
mental-oxygen group), on the basis of the number 
of patients needed to treat. Because supplemen-

tal oxygen is expensive and its use is burdensome, 
the hazard ratio of 0.60 was also judged to be 
appropriate for the composite primary outcome 
of death or first hospitalization in the time-to-
event analysis.
Under the original trial design, we assumed 
that the crossover rate from the no-supplemental-
oxygen group to the supplemental-oxygen group 
would be 21% and the crossover rate from the 
supplemental-oxygen group to the no-supple-
mental-oxygen group would be 50%, on the basis 
of investigator consensus. In March 2012, the 
data and safety monitoring board approved the 
use of the observed crossover rates of 11.7% 
(from the no-supplemental-oxygen group to the 
supplemental-oxygen group) and 3.1% (from the 
supplemental-oxygen group to the no-supple-
mental-oxygen group) to refine the sample-size 
calculation. Additional details about the sample-
size calculation are provided in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Data were analyzed according to the treatment 
group to which the patients were randomly as-
signed (intention-to-treat approach) except as 
otherwise noted. A Cox proportional-hazards 
model21 with one binary covariate for treatment 
group was used to estimate the between-group 
hazard ratio for the primary composite outcome 
in the time-to-event analysis; the log-rank test 
was used for the P value. This method was also 
used for each of the secondary outcomes in the 
time-to-event analysis.
The consistency of the hazard ratio for the 
primary outcome across prespecified subgroups 
was assessed by a series of Cox proportional-
hazard models with covariates that included the 
treatment-group indicator, indicators for the 
levels of the subgroup factor, and treatment-by-
subgroup interaction terms. The P values for 
consistency of hazard ratios across subgroups 
were determined by Wald chi-square tests. Per the 
trial protocol, all reported P values are nominal 
and two-sided and were not corrected for mul-
tiple, prespecified comparisons. A P value of less 
than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical 
significance for the composite primary outcome, 
and a P value of less than 0.01 was considered to 
indicate statistical significance for a treatment-
by-subgroup interaction effect on the primary 
outcome. Bonferroni corrections were used to 
determine the P values that were required for 
statistical significance of the trial-group differ-
ences on the secondary and other outcomes and 
for statistical significance of the multiple treat-
ment-by-subgroup interaction effects on the pri-
mary outcome that were assessed.22 Additional 
details about the statistical analysis are provided 
in the protocol and the Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Trial Population
From January 2009 through August 2014, a total 
of 738 patients at 42 centers underwent random-
ization in the trial: 368 patients were randomly 
assigned to the supplemental-oxygen group and 
370 to the no-supplemental-oxygen group (Fig. S1 
and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In 
the supplemental-oxygen group, 220 patients were 
prescribed 24-hour oxygen and 148 were pre-
scribed oxygen during exercise and sleep only. 
Of the 738 patients who underwent randomiza-
tion, 133 (18%) had resting desaturation only, 319 
(43%) had exercise-induced desaturation only, 
and 286 (39%) had both types of desaturation. 
The trial groups were similar at baseline except 
that the patients in the supplemental-oxygen 
group had a lower BODE index (a scoring system 
incorporating information on the body-mass in-
dex, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and 6-minute 
walk distance; higher scores indicate a greater 
risk of death)23 than those in the no-supplemen-
tal-oxygen group (Table 1, and Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Patients were followed for 1 to 6 years; the 
last visits occurred during the period from May 
through August 2015 (median follow-up, 18.4 
months). Vital status as of August 31, 2015, was 
ascertained in all patients. A total of 97% of the 
patients had at least 1 year of follow-up for hos-
pitalization. Most patients in the supplemental-
oxygen group used 2 liters of oxygen per minute 
during exercise throughout follow-up (Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary Outcome
In a time-to-event analysis, we found no signifi-
cant difference between the trial groups in the 
composite outcome of death or first hospitaliza-
tion for any cause or in either component (Fig. 1 
and Table 2). No significant difference was not-
ed in the subgroups defined according to oxygen

The Quality of Well-Being Scale is a 77-item quality-of-life questionnaire completed by the patient. A score of 0 indicates 
death. The mean daily score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The minimum clini-
cally important difference is 0.03.13,14

ing better health-related qualify of life. The minimum clinically important difference is 4.15,16
¶  
The nadir Spo2 is the 10th lowest Spo2 observed during the 6-minute walk. A total of 10 patients (6 patients in the sup-
plemental-oxygen group and 4 in the no-supplemental-oxygen group) either did not attempt or began but did not com-
plete the 6-minute walk. Reasons included being in a wheelchair, amputation of foot or leg, sciatic pain, starting the walk 
and stopping because of back pain, or other reason; these 10 participants met the resting hypoxemia criterion. The 
 
nadir Spo2 could not be calculated for 146 patients (70 patients in the supplemental-oxygen group and 76 in the no-
supplemental-oxygen group) owing to loss of their oximetry data file or a technical issue with their oximetry data file 
obtained at enrollment.

Figure 1. Kaplan–Meier Analyses of the Primary Outcome of Death or First Hospitalization for Any Cause  
and for the Component Events in the Intention-to-Treat Population.
Panel A shows the results of a time-to-event analysis of the primary outcome, which was a composite of death or first 
hospitalization for any cause; the median follow-up was 18.4 months. Data for 120 patients who were assigned to re-
ceive long-term supplemental oxygen (supplemental-oxygen group) and 120 assigned to receive no long-term supple-
mental oxygen (no-supplemental-oxygen group) who neither died nor had a hospitalization were censored at the date 
of the last interview. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals (assessed every 12 months). For the time-to-event 
analysis of the first hospitalization for any cause, the median follow-up was 18.4 months. Data for 139 patients in the 
supplemental-oxygen group and 133 in the no-supplemental-oxygen group were censored as of their date of death (if 
there was no hospitalization before death) or as of the date of their last interview (if they were alive and had no hospi-
talization). Panel B shows the results of a time-to-event analysis of death; the median follow-up was 41.5 months. 
Data for 302 patients in the supplemental-oxygen group and 297 in the no-supplemental-oxygen group who were alive 
on August 31, 2015, were censored as of that date. The hazard ratios and 95% confidence limits were derived from 
Cox  
regression models, with supplemental oxygen versus no supplemental oxygen as the single model variable. P val-
ues were derived from log-rank tests. For the components of the composite primary outcome (death and first hospi-
talization), a P value of less than 0.025 (0.05 divided by 2) was considered to indicate statistical significance, with the 
use of a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.22

10th lowest Spo2 observed during the 6-minute 
walk), forced expiratory volume in 1 second, 
BODE index, SF-36 physical-component score, 
body-mass index, or history of anemia (Table S6 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Patients in the supplemental-oxygen group 
who reported having had a COPD exacerbation 
1 to 3 months before enrollment had a longer 
time to death or first hospitalization than simi-
lar patients in the no-supplemental-oxygen group 
(hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.39 to 0.88; P 
= 
0.007 for interaction), as did 
patients who were 71 years of age or older at 
enrollment (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 
0.99; P 
= 
0.03 for interaction) and those who had 
a lower quality of life (Quality of Well-Being 
Scale score, <0.55) at enrollment (hazard ratio, 
0.77; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.99; P 
= 
0.03 for interac-
tion). However, none of these subgroup-by-
treatment interaction effects were significant 
when the analysis was adjusted for multiple 
comparisons. In the as-treated analysis, no dif-
ference was found between patients who used 
oxygen for at least 16 hours per day and all 
others. (Details are provided in Tables S6 and 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Adherence to Regimen
Histograms of self-reported use of supplemental 
oxygen as averaged over follow-up indicate much 
longer daily mean (±SD) use in the supplemental-
oxygen group than in the no-supplemental-oxygen 
group (13.6±6.1 vs. 1.8±3.9 hours per day) (Fig. 2). 
There was a separation of patients in the supple-
mental-oxygen group according to prescription 
(15.1±6.2 hours per day in the 24-hour group vs. 
11.3±5.0 hours per day in the sleep–exercise 
group), but there was considerable overlap. A com-
parison of self-reported stationary concentrator 
use with use that was calculated from meter 
readings in 100 patients in the supplemental-
oxygen group who had available data showed a 
significant linear trend in bias (P<0.001), in 
which patients with less-than-average hours of

The primary outcome was death or first hospitalization for any cause, whichever came first, in patients randomly as-
signed to receive supplemental oxygen as compared with those assigned to receive no supplemental oxygen. For the 
composite-event analysis, data from 120 patients in the supplemental-oxygen group and 120 in the no-supplemental-
oxygen group who neither died nor had a hospitalization were censored as of their last interview. For the analysis of 
death, data for 302 patients in the supplemental-oxygen group and 297 in the no-supplemental-oxygen group who were 
alive on August 31, 2015, were censored as of that date. For the analysis of the first hospitalization, data for 139 patients 
in the supplemental-oxygen group and 133 in the no-supplemental-oxygen group were censored as of their date of death 
(if there was no hospitalization before death) or as of the date of their last interview (if they were alive and had no hos-
pitalization). For the components of the composite primary outcome (death and first hospitalization), a P value of less 
than 0.025 (0.05 divided by 2) was considered to indicate statistical significance, with the use of a Bonferroni adjust-
ment for multiplicity of comparisons.22 P values were calculated by the log-rank test. CI denotes confidence interval.

daily use tended to overestimate their use and 
those with greater-than-average hours of daily 
use tended to underestimate their use (Fig. S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Comparison with Design Assumptions
Fewer enrollees than expected were hospitalized 
in the year before screening. However, more 
patients than expected were hospitalized during 
follow-up. Observed mortality rates compared 
well with the design assumptions (Table S8 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Other Outcomes
The two trial groups did not differ significantly 
with regard to the rates of all hospitalizations 
(rate ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.13), COPD 
exacerbations (rate ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98 to 
1.19), COPD-related hospitalizations (rate ratio, 
0.99; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.17), or non–COPD-related 
hospitalizations (rate ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.90 to 
1.18). (Fig. S3 and Table S9 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). We found no consistent differ-
ences between groups in the change from base-
line in measures of quality of life, anxiety,

Shown are histograms of total self-reported hours of supplemental-oxygen use per day (sum of stationary use and 
portable use) according to randomized assignment and prescription for supplemental oxygen (24-hour use or use 
during sleep and exercise). Plus–minus values are means ±SD. The value plotted for a patient is the mean of all the 
patient’s self-reports during follow-up. Self-reports were obtained 3 times yearly in the no-supplemental-oxygen 
group. In the supplemental-oxygen group, self-reports were more frequent during year 1 (12 times) and were ob-
tained 3 times yearly thereafter. The median number of self-reports for a patient was 20 in the supplemental-oxygen 
group (range, 6 to 20) and 8 in the no-supplemental-oxygen group (range, 0 to 18). All the patients in the supple-
mental-oxygen group provided at least one assessment; 363 patients (98%) in the no-supplemental-oxygen group 
provided at least one assessment. IQR denotes interquartile range.

Long-Term Oxygen for COPD with Moderate Desaturation
depression, or in lung function, distance walked 
in 6 minutes, or other measures of functional 
status (Fig. S4 and Table S10 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Adverse Events
A total of 51 adverse events were attributed to 
the use of supplemental oxygen (Table S11 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). There were 23 reports 
of tripping over equipment, with two patients 
requiring hospitalization. Five patients reported 
a total of six instances of fires or burns, with 
one patient requiring hospitalization.
Discussion
We found that the prescription of supplemental 
oxygen for patients with stable COPD and rest-
ing or exercise-induced moderate desaturation 
did not affect the time to death or first hospital-
ization, time to death, time to first hospitaliza-
tion, time to first COPD exacerbation, time to 
first hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation, 
the rate of all hospitalizations, the rate of all 
COPD exacerbations, or changes in measures of 
quality of life, depression, anxiety, or functional 
status. We found no effect on the primary out-
come in subgroups of patients defined according 
to desaturation type, prescription type, or adher-
ence to the regimen. The consistency of the null 
findings strengthens the overall conclusion that 
long-term supplemental oxygen in patients with 
stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced 
moderate desaturation has no benefit with regard 
to the multiple outcomes measured.
Our data support the conclusions of earlier 
studies that among patients with COPD who 
have a resting Spo2 of more than 88%, long-term 
treatment with supplemental oxygen does not re-
sult in longer survival than no long-term supple-
mental oxygen therapy, regardless of whether 
the patients have exercise-induced desaturation.5,6,24 
Our findings contrast with the prolonged survival 
that was observed among patients with COPD 
and severe desaturation who were treated with 
supplemental oxygen.1,2 Possible reasons for this 
discrepancy are the nonlinear threshold effects 
of oxygen saturation on pulmonary vasoconstric-
tion, mediator release, and ventilatory drive,25,26 
which occur with an Spo2 of 88% or less and 
which may be more important in patients with 
chronic hypoxemia.
A systematic review and meta-analysis sug-
gested that oxygen therapy may reduce dyspnea 
in patients with COPD and mild or no hypox-
emia.27 We found no consistent benefit of long-
term supplemental oxygen with regard to mea-
sures of quality of life, depression, anxiety, or 
functional status.
This trial has some limitations. First, some 
patients may not have enrolled in the trial be-
cause they or their providers believed that they 
were too ill or that they benefited from oxygen. 
Highly symptomatic patients who declined en-
rollment might have had a different response to 
oxygen than what we observed in the enrolled 
patients. Second, the lack of masking may have 
influenced some of the patient-reported out-
comes; however, it is unlikely to have influenced 
the primary outcome. Third, we did not use uni-
form devices for oxygen delivery; it is possible 
that there was variability in the amount of oxy-
gen delivered. Fourth, the immediate effects of 
oxygen on symptoms or exercise performance 
were not assessed. We did not measure noctur-
nal oxygen saturation; some patients with COPD 
and severe nocturnal desaturation might benefit 
from nocturnal oxygen supplementation.28,29 Fifth, 
patients’ self-reported adherence may have been 
an overestimate of their actual oxygen use. How-
ever, we found good agreement with the use as 
measured by means of serial meter readings on 
the concentrator. The estimated mean hours per 
day of use in the supplemental-oxygen group 
(15.1±6.2 hours per day in the 24-hour group 
and 11.3±5.0 hours per day in the sleep–exercise 
group) (Fig. 2) was similar to the use observed 
in the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (17.7 hours 
per day in the continuous-oxygen group and 
12.0 hours per day in the nocturnal-oxygen 
group).1 However, we cannot exclude the pos-
sibility that longer exposures to oxygen in the 
supplemental-oxygen group might have given 
different results. Finally, because hospitalization 
was recorded from self-report every 4 months, 
it is possible that we underestimated the num-
ber of hospitalizations; however, there did not 
appear to be systematic bias in follow-up be-
tween groups.
In conclusion, among patients with stable 
COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate 
desaturation, we found that long-term supple-
mental oxygen did not provide any benefit with 
respect to the time to death or first hospitaliza-
