BACKGROUND: It is currently unknown whether intensive blood pressure (BP) 
lowering beyond that recommended would lead to more lowering of the risk 
of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension and whether 
reducing the risk of LVH explains the reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
benefits of intensive BP lowering in this population.
METHODS: This analysis included 8164 participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 
35.3% women; 31.2% blacks) with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus 
from the SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial): 4086 randomly 
assigned to intensive BP lowering (target SBP <120 mm Hg) and 4078 assigned 
to standard BP lowering (target SBP <140 mm Hg). Progression and regression 
of LVH as defined by Cornell voltage criteria derived from standard 12-lead 
ECGs recorded at baseline and biannually were compared between treatment 
arms during a median follow-up of 3.81 years. The effect of intensive (versus 
standard) BP lowering on the SPRINT primary CVD outcome (a composite of 
myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, and CVD 
death) was compared before and after adjustment for LVH as a time-varying 
covariate.
RESULTS: Among SPRINT participants without baseline LVH (n=7559), 
intensive (versus standard) BP lowering was associated with a 46% lower risk 
of developing LVH (hazard ratio=0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.68). 
Similarly, among SPRINT participants with baseline LVH (n=605, 7.4%), those 
assigned to the intensive (versus standard) BP lowering were 66% more likely 
to regress/improve their LVH (hazard ratio=1.66; 95% confidence interval, 
1.31–2.11). Adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate did not substantially 
attenuate the effect of intensive BP therapy on CVD events (hazard ratio of 
intensive versus standard BP lowering on CVD, 0.76 [95% confidence interval, 
0.64–0.90] and 0.77 [95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.91] before and after 
adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus, 
intensive BP lowering (target systolic BP <120 mm 
Hg) compared with standard 
BP lowering (target systolic BP <140 mm 
Hg) resulted in lower rates of developing 
new LVH in those without LVH and higher rates of regression of LVH in those with 
existing LVH. This favorable effect on LVH did not explain most of the reduction in 
CVD events associated with intensive BP lowering in the SPRINT trial.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
L
eft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a common find-
ing in patients with hypertension, is a maladaptive 
response to chronic pressure overload.1 Successful 
management of high blood pressure (BP) modifies this 
response and produces regression of LVH, and selec-
tion of individual antihypertensive drugs appears to be 
less important than the management of BP itself.2 In 
patients with both hypertension and diabetes mellitus, 
we have recently shown that more intensive lower-
ing of BP (target systolic BP [SBP] <120 mm Hg) leads 
to more reduction in the risk of LVH.3 Similar results 
were reported from a small clinical trial in which SBP 
lowering to <130 mm Hg was compared with a goal 
of <140 mm Hg in adults ≥55 years of age without 
diabetes mellitus.4 However, it is yet to be established 
whether a more intensive lowering (target SBP <120 
mm Hg) in a diverse population with hypertension 
without diabetes mellitus will result in a lower risk of 
LVH compared with standard BP lowering (target SBP 
<140 mm Hg).
Development of LVH is known to be associated with 
a greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity 
and mortality, and this risk could be reversed by regres-
sion of LVH.5–11 In the Framingham Heart Study, regres-
sion in the electrocardiographic Cornell voltage LVH 
criteria was associated with a lower risk of clinical CVD, 
whereas progression in Cornell voltage identified indi-
viduals at increased risk of CVD.5 Similar conclusions 
were reported from MRFIT (Multiple Risk-Factor Inter-
vention Trial),6 HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Eval-
uation),7 and LIFE (Losartan Intervention For End Point 
Reduction in Hypertension Study).8–11 In SPRINT (Systolic 
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which included pa-
tients with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus, in-
tensive BP lowering targeting a SBP of <120 mm 
Hg, 
compared with standard SBP lowering targeting <140 
mm 
Hg, resulted in lower rates of CVD events.12 Wheth-
er this effect of intensive BP lowering on reducing CVD 
events could be explained by its effect on LVH is also 
currently unknown.
Therefore, we examined the differential impact of 
intensive BP lowering (target SBP <120 mm 
Hg) ver-
sus standard BP lowering (target SBP <140 mm 
Hg) on 
LVH in SPRINT, a randomized, multicenter trial involving 
middle-aged and older patients with hypertension but 
no diabetes mellitus. We also examined whether the 
positive effect of intensive BP lowering on the CVD out-
comes in SPRINT is explained by its effect on LVH.
METHODS
Study Population and Design
SPRINT was a randomized, controlled, open-label trial that 
was conducted at 102 clinical sites organized into 5 clini-
cal center networks in the United States. The rationale and 
design of the SPRINT trial have been published elsewhere.12,13 
Briefly, SPRINT aimed to test whether reducing SBP to <120 
mm Hg reduces CVD events, defined as a composite of non-
fatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not 
resulting in myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, nonfa-
tal acute decompensated heart failure, and death result-
ing from CVD (SPRINT primary outcome). Participants were 
required to meet all the following criteria: age of at least 
50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg, and an increased risk 
of CVD defined as presence of 1 or more of the following: 
clinical or subclinical CVD, chronic kidney disease, a 10-year 
risk of CVD ≥15% estimated by the Framingham risk score, 
or age ≥75 years. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or 
prior stroke were excluded.
A total of 9361 participants were enrolled between 
November 2010 and March 2013, of whom 4683 were ran-
domized to a SBP target of <140 mm 
Hg (standard treat-
ment arm) and 4678 participants were randomized to <120 
mm 
Hg (intensive treatment arm). Randomization was strati-
fied by clinical site. The SPRINT intervention was stopped early 
(median follow-up, 3.26 years) because of a 25% reduction in 
the primary composite CVD end point and a 27% reduction 
in all-cause mortality in the intensive treatment group. The 
study was approved by the institutional review board at each 
participating site, and written informed consent was obtained 
from all participants.
For the purpose of this analysis, we included SPRINT par-
ticipants with baseline and at least 1 follow-up ECG. On the 
other hand, we excluded participants with missing or uninter-
pretable baseline ECG (n=138) and those without any follow-
up ECG (n=1059).
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In patients with hypertension but no diabetes mel-
litus enrolled in SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure 
Intervention Trial), intensive blood pressure lower-
ing (target <120 mm 
Hg) reduced the risk of left 
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by preventing the 
development of new LVH in those without LVH and 
causing regression of LVH in those with existing 
LVH.
• This favorable impact on LVH, however, did not 
explain most of the reduction in cardiovascular 
events associated with intensive blood pressure 
lowering.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• These findings add further evidence of the benefits 
of intensive blood pressure lowering in patients 
with hypertension and suggest that these benefits 
go beyond reducing the hemodynamic stress on 
the cardiac structure.
• Further research is needed to understand the 
mediating factors and the mechanisms by which 
intensive blood pressure lowering affects the car-
diovascular system.

Ascertainment of LVH
LVH was ascertained from standard 12-lead ECGs obtained 
at baseline, year 2, year 4, and the close-out visit. Digital 
ECG data were recorded with a GE MAC 1200 ECG (GE, 
Milwaukee, WI) at 10-mm/mV calibration and a speed 
of 25 mm/s. ECG reading was performed centrally at the 
Epidemiological Cardiology Research Center, Wake Forest 
School of Medicine (Winston-Salem, NC). All ECG tracings 
were initially inspected visually for technical errors and inad-
equate quality before being automatically processed with GE 
12-SL Marquette version 2001.
LVH was defined by Cornell voltage criteria (RaVL 
amplitude+SV3 amplitude) using the following sex-specific 
cutoff points: ≥2200 µV in women and ≥2800 µV in men.14 
LVH was considered present or absent (or changed from 
one status to another) on the basis of crossing these cutoff 
points up or down. In addition to LVH as a categorical/binary 
variable, Cornell voltage was examined as a continuous vari-
able (referred to here as Cornell index). Using Cornell volt-
age as a continuous variable has the advantage of being 
not dependent on the cutoff points selected to define LVH, 
and it is more sensitive to changes during follow-up than 
LVH as a categorical variable.3 In sensitivity analysis, we 
also used Cornell voltage product ([RaVL amplitude+SV3 
amplitude]×QRS 
duration)15 
and 
Sokolow-Lyon 
(SV1 
amplitude+RV5/V6 amplitude)16 LVH criteria. In addition, we 
used LVH by Minnesota Code ECG classification, which rep-
resents LVH criteria with ST/T abnormalities (LVH with strain 
pattern) in selected analyses that do not requires the use 
of continuous measures (such Cornell index). Minnesota 
Code LVH is defined as high-amplitude R waves (Minnesota 
Code 3.1: R amplitude >26 mm in either V5 or V6; R ampli-
tude >20.0 mm in any of leads I, II, m, or aVF; or R ampli-
tude >12.0 mm in lead aVL) plus major ST/T abnormalities 
(Minnesota Codes 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, or 5.2).17
Events and Other Study Measurements
Demographic data were collected at baseline before random-
ization. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at base-
line and every 3 months thereafter. Details of the assessment 
of BP
, adjustment of medication doses, and antihypertensive 
drug regimens during the trial are provided elsewhere.13
At each visit, trained clinical staff measured BPs with 
an automated BP device (Omron-HEM-907 XL, Omron 
Healthcare, Inc, Bannockburn, IL) using standardized pro-
cedures.13 BP measurement requirements included measur-
ing BP early in the visit and not after stressful examination 
components such as blood draws, proper positioning of 
the participant in a chair with back support, and proper 
cuff size determination. The manual of procedures stated 
that participants should be resting, not completing ques-
tionnaires, and not speaking with study staff during the 
5-minute rest period or while BP measurements were 
being taken. The manual of procedures also stated that 
staff should leave the room during the 5-minute rest period 
and provided a script that staff could use to explain that 
they would be absent during the 5-minute rest period and 
would then enter the room and obtain the measurements 
without speaking to the participant. At 1 year, the SBP fell 
in the intensive treatment group by ≈15 mm Hg more than 
in the standard treatment group (mean SBP, 121.4 versus 
136.2 mm Hg) with administration of an average of 1 more 
antihypertensive medication.
A structured interview was used in both treatment arms 
every 3 months to obtain self-reported CVD outcomes. 
Medical records and ECG data were obtained for documenta-
tion of events. Whenever clinical site staff became aware of 
a death, a standard protocol was used to obtain information 
on the event. Members of a committee who were unaware 
of the study group assignments adjudicated the clinical out-
comes specified in the protocol. Details on the adjudication 
of these outcomes, including the CVD events, have been 
published elsewhere.12 The CVD outcomes in this analysis 
included events through August 20, 2015, similar to the main 
report from the SPRINT trial but limited to the sample with a 
good-quality baseline ECG and at least 1 follow-up ECG.
Statistical Analyses
We used Cox proportional hazards regression to compare the 
time to the first occurrence of LVH in those without baseline 
LVH and to the first occurrence of regression of LVH (ie, recov-
ery from LVH) in those with baseline LVH, separately, between 
the treatment arms. Clinical site at randomization was used 
as a stratification factor. Follow-up time was censored on the 
date of last ECG. Interactions between treatment effect and 
SPRINT prespecified subgroups (age [<75 versus ≥75 years], 
sex, race [black versus nonblack], SBP tertiles [≤132, >132 to 
<145, ≥145 mm 
Hg], prior CVD, and prior chronic kidney dis-
ease) were assessed with a likelihood ratio test for the interac-
tion with the use of Hommel-adjusted18 P values.
To examine whether the impact of intensive BP lowering 
on the primary outcome is explained by its impact on LVH, 
we examined the magnitude of attenuation of the associa-
tion between intensive (versus standard) BP lowering and the 
SPRINT primary CVD outcome after adjusting for LVH as a 
time-varying covariate. Similar to the main SPRINT results 
publication,12 Cox proportional hazards regression with strati-
fication according to clinic was used for this purpose.
Several additional analyses were conducted as follows. 
First, we compared the rate of regression of the mean Cornell 
index during follow-up (as a continuous variable) between 
the intensive and standard arms. In this analysis, we used lin-
ear mixed-effects models adjusting for baseline value of the 
Cornel index. Specifically, we looked at random slope and 
intercept models for each individual to have a separate inter-
cept and slope for the longitudinal change in Cornell index 
over time and for there to be population-averaged intercepts 
and slopes. Second, we conducted sensitivity analysis in which 
we excluded 718 participants with major intraventricular con-
duction delay. This was done because the ECG diagnosis of 
LVH in those individuals needs to be interpreted with caution 
according to the current guidelines for the use of ECG criteria 
for detection of cardiac chamber enlargement.19 Major intra-
ventricular conduction included all participants with complete 
left and right bundle-branch blocks, Wolf-Parkinson-White 
syndrome, ventricular pacemaker, and major nonspecific 
conduction delay (all with QRS duration ≥120 millisecond). 
Finally, we used Cornell voltage product and Sokolow-Lyon 
LVH criteria in analyses similar to those used for Cornell volt-
age to confirm the results, as well as Minnesota Code LVH in

selected analyses that involve LVH as a categorical variable 
only (ie, present versus absent analysis only).
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). For Cox regression models, the 
proportional hazards assumption was checked and was met. 
All P values reported were 2 sided, and statistical significance 
threshold was chosen as 5%.
RESULTS
A total of 8164 participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 
35.3% women; 31.2% blacks) were included in the 
analysis (4086 from the intensive BP lowering and 4078 
from the standard BP lowering). About 7.4% (n=605) of 
the participants had LVH at baseline, with a similar preva-
lence in both arms (302 in the intensive BP-lowering arm 
and 303 in the standard BP arm). The baseline character-
istics of the study participants did not differ by treatment 
arms in the study overall or in subgroups stratified by LVH 
status. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 
overall sample, and Tables I and II in the online-only Data 
Supplement show the baseline characteristics in those 
without and with baseline LVH, respectively.
Among SPRINT participants without LVH at base-
line (n= 7559) and during a median follow-up of 
3.81 years, 324 new cases of LVH occurred (118 in 
the intensive BP-lowering arm and 206 in the stan-
dard BP arm). Intensive (compared with standard) BP 
lowering was associated with a 46% (P<0.001) lower 
risk of developing LVH (Table 2). These results were 
consistent across subgroups of age, sex, race, SBP 
levels, prior CVD, and prior chronic kidney disease 
(Figure 1).
Similarly, regression (improvement) of LVH was more 
common in the intensive versus standard BP-lowering arm. 
Among SPRINT participants with baseline LVH (n=605), 
62% (n=377) showed regression of (recovery from) their 
LVH (211 [70%] in the intensive BP-lowering arm versus 
166 [55%] in the standard BP arm). Participants assigned

to the intensive (compared with standard) BP lowering 
were 66% (P<0.001) more likely to regress their LVH (Ta-
ble 3). These results were consistent among subgroups of 
SPRINT participants stratified by age, sex, race, SBP levels, 
and prior chronic kidney disease, but the effect was stron-
ger in those with prior CVD compared with those without 
prior CVD (interaction P=0.001; Figure 2).
With the use of random-coefficient models in all 
participants with and without baseline LVH, the rate 
of regression of Cornell voltage index (the sum of the 
amplitude of RaVL+SV3) was faster in the intensive BP-
lowering arm than that in the standard arm by −33.7 
µV/y (95% confidence interval [CI], −39.6 to −27.8; 
P<0.001; Table 4).
Similar effects of intensive BP lowering on LVH were 
observed with LVH criteria other than the Cornell volt-
age criteria we used in the main analysis. As shown in 
Table III in the online-only Data Supplement, intensive 
BP lowering was associated with a lower incidence of 
developing new LVH by Cornell voltage product (haz-
ard ratio [HR]=0.59; 95% CI, 0.49–0.71), Sokolow-
Lyon (HR=0.50; 95% CI, 0.36–0.70), and Minnesota 
Code (HR=0.65; 95% CI, 0.46–0.90) in SPRINT partici-
pants without LVH by these criteria at baseline. In ad-
dition, intensive BP lowering was associated with more 
regression (improvement) of LVH by Cornell voltage 
product (HR=1.22; 95% CI, 1.02–1.45), Sokolow-Lyon 
(HR=1.78; 95% CI, 1.34–2.39), and Minnesota Code

(HR=1.57; 95% CI, 1.03, 2.42) in SPRINT participants 
with LVH when these criteria were used at baseline, as 
shown in Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement.
With the use of random-coefficient models in all par-
ticipants with and without baseline LVH, the rates of re-
gression of Cornell voltage product index and Sokolow-
Lyon index (ie, as continuous variables) were also faster 
in the intensive BP-lowering arm than in the standard 
arm, similar to what was observed in the main analysis 
with Cornell voltage index (Table V in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
When we excluded 718 participants with major in-
traventricular conduction delay, the impact of intensive 
(compared with standard) BP lowering on the risk of 
developing new LVH remained similar to that observed 
without this exclusion regardless of the ECG LVH cri-
teria used (HR=0.53 [95% CI, 0.41–0.69] for Cornell 
voltage; HR=0.58 [95% CI, 0.48–0.71] for Cornell 
voltage product; HR=0.47 [95% CI, 0.33–0.67] for 
Sokolow-Lyon; and HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.46–0.92] for 
Minnesota Code LVH; Table VI in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Among SPRINT participants with ECG data who were 
included in the analysis (n=8164), a total of 552 CVD 
events occurred, whereas 10 events occurred among 
those excluded from the analysis because of missing or

uninterpretable ECG data (n=1197). Intensive BP lower-
ing was associated with a 24% (P=0.001) lower risk of 
CVD events, which was marginally attenuated to 23% 
lower risk (P=0.003) after adjustment for LVH as a time-
varying covariate among those with ECG data. Notably, 
in the same model, presence (versus absence) of LVH 
as a time-varying covariate was associated with almost 
twice the risk of CVD events compared with those 
without LVH (HR=1.99; 95% CI, 1.53–2.57; P<0.001; 
Table 5).
A similar magnitude of attenuation was observed 
when Cornell voltage index (as a continuous variable) 
was used in the model as a time-varying covariate in-
stead of ECG LVH. That is to say, the effect of intensive 
BP on lowering the risk of the primary outcome also 
was attenuated from 24% (P=0.001) to 23% (P=0.002; 
Table 5). In the same model, each 1-SD (669 µV) in-
crease in mean Cornell voltage index was associated 
with 23% increased risk of CVD events (HR=1.23; 95% 
CI, 1.13–1.32; P<0.001).
Using Cornell voltage product or Sokolow-Lyon 
Criteria as either a categorical or continuous variable 
instead of Cornell voltage yielded the same marginal 
attenuation of the relationship between intensive BP 
lowering and CVD events (Tables VII and VIII in the 
online-only Data Supplement). In addition, there was 
no effect modification (ie, interaction) by baseline ECG-
LVH status by any of the criteria on the relationship be-
tween intensive BP lowering and the SPRINT primary 
CVD outcome (interaction P=0.52 for Cornell voltage 
LVH, 0.57 for Cornell voltage product LVH, and 0.66 
for Sokolow-Lyon LVH; Table IX in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
DISCUSSION
Principal Findings
In this post hoc analysis from the SPRINT trial, we exam-
ined the effect of intensive BP lowering on the risk of 
LVH and whether this effect explains the reported car-
diovascular benefits of intensive BP lowering in patients 
with hypertension at high risk for CVD but no diabetes 
mellitus. The key findings are the following: (1) Inten-
sive BP lowering compared with standard BP lowering 
resulted in lower rates of developing new LVH in those 
without LVH, with these results consistent among sev-
eral subgroups of SPRINT participants; (2) intensive BP 
lowering compared with standard BP lowering resulted 
in more regression of LVH in those with existing LVH, 
with the effect of intensive BP lowering on regression 
of LVH stronger in those with than in those without 
prior CVD but consistent across other subgroups; (3) 
the benefit of CVD risk reduction associated with inten-
sive BP lowering was not substantially attenuated after 
adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate; and (4) 
there was no effect modification of the baseline LVH 
status on the relationship between intensive BP lower-
ing and SPRINT primary CVD outcome.
These results taken together indicate that inten-
sive BP lowering resulted in lower rates of LVH in the 
SPRINT trial by reducing the risk of developing new 
LVH and improving existing LVH. This favorable im-
pact on LVH, however, appears to explain little of the 
reduction in CVD events associated with intensive BP 
lowering in SPRINT.

Results in Context
LVH is an adaptive response to the wall stress associ-
ated with increased impedance to ventricular empty-
ing caused by increased peripheral resistance occur-
ring as a result of high BP.20 This explains results from 
several prior reports showing that regression of LVH 
is possible by interventions aimed at lowering high 
BP.21–30 However, these studies were not designed to 
examine whether lowering BP beyond a standard goal 
of <140 to 150/90 mm Hg is associated with greater 
reduction of the risk of LVH. Only 2 trials, however, 
have tried to answer this question. In the Cardio-
Sis trial (Controllo della Pressione Arteriosa Sistolica; 
1111 participants without diabetes mellitus and with 
at least 1 CVD risk factor), lowering of SBP to <130 
mm Hg decreased the likelihood of ECG LVH by 39% 
compared with usual lowering to SBP <140 mm Hg.4 
In the ACCORD BP trial (Action to Control Cardiovas-
cular Risk in Diabetes–Blood Pressure; 4331 partici-
pants with hypertension with diabetes mellitus and at 
high risk of CVD), intensive BP lowering (target SBP 
to <120 mm Hg) resulted in a similar 39% reduction 
in LVH risk compared with standard BP lowering (tar-
get <140 mm Hg).3 To the best of our knowledge, our 
results from the SPRINT trial are the first to provide 
evidence from a randomized clinical trial that includes 
a large diverse population of patients with hyperten-
sion without diabetes mellitus to suggest that inten-
sive BP lowering (SBP <120 mm Hg) is associated with 
a lower risk of LVH compared with standard BP lower-
ing (SBP <140 mm Hg).
Although mechanical stress resulting from pressure 
overload is the major driver for LVH in patients with 
hypertension, it is currently recognized that neuro-
hormonal abnormalities also play an important role. 
Neurohormonal substances such as angiotensin II, 
aldosterone, norepinephrine, and insulin can directly 
promote myocyte hypertrophy and matrix deposition 
independently of their effects on systemic arterial 
pressure.31 This could explain why, although success-
ful lowering of SBP in our study caused regression 
of LVH in a large proportion of SPRINT participants 
with baseline LVH (62% total; 70% in intensive arm, 
and 55% in standard arm), some patients remained 
with LVH. It also has been reported that LVH can lead 
to irreversible fibrosis and scars in the myocardium 
that may not be responsive to antihypertensive treat-
ment,32 which also could explain why successful BP 
lowering did not improve all LVH and suggests that 
preventing the development of LVH rather than treat-
ing it may be a better strategy.
We also found that the benefit of intensive BP low-
ering on the risk of CVD events was not meaningfully 
influenced by its favorable effect on LVH. This suggests 
that the effect of intensive BP lowering on CVD may be 
through different mechanisms and LVH is just one of 
many mediating factors. Another possible explanation 
is that LVH perhaps mediates the effect of intensive BP 
lowering on certain CVD outcomes but not others. It 
is notable that intensive BP lowering was associated 
with a lower risk of heart failure but not myocardial 
infarction or acute coronary syndromes in SPRINT; all 
are SPRINT secondary outcomes.34 Compared with a 
composite of CVD events33 or coronary heart disease,34 
LVH is an established predictor heart failure and is a 
component of the Framingham heart failure risk pre-
diction score.35 This may explain why intensive BP low-
ering selectively reduced the risk of heart failure more 
than other SPRINT secondary CVD outcomes. Because 
of the relatively small number of individual SPRINT 
secondary CVD outcomes (heart failure, stoke, myo-
cardial infarction, and death resulting from any cause), 
we could not usefully examine the associations among 
intensive BP lowering, individual CVD outcomes, and 
LVH; that is, there is a statistical power limitation.
On the basis of our results in SPRINT, which included 
patients with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus, 
and taking into account our prior results from the AC-
CORD BP trial, which included patients with hyperten-
sion and diabetes mellitus,3 it could be suggested that 
intensive treatment to a target SBP of <120 mm Hg in 
hypertensive patients at high risk of CVD will reduce 
the risk of LVH. Nevertheless, there could be variations 
in the response to the effect of intensive BP lowering 
on LVH among certain groups. In our subgroup anal-
ysis, those with prior CVD showed more benefit for 
regression of LVH, although they did not show more 
benefit for developing new incident LVH during the 
follow-up period.
Limitations and Strengths
Our results should be read in the context of certain 
limitations and methodological considerations. By de-
sign, the SPRINT trial had an open-label design, which 
could lead to bias in the identification of certain types 
of end points. However, it is unlikely that the open-
label design had an impact on the ascertainment of 
LVH, which was measured from ECGs that were read 
centrally at an ECG core laboratory by investigators 
blinded to treatment assignment. Because SPRINT was 
a treatment strategy trial in the sense that it examined 
the effect of different levels of SBP rather than the 
effect of individual drugs, we could not separate the 
impact of lowering BP from the impact of individual 
medications. Another limitation is that it may not be 
appropriate to generalize our findings to other types of 
hypertension patients not included in SPRINT such as 
those with lower CVD risk, with prior stroke, <50 years 
of age, or with diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, some 
of these groups such as those with hypertension and

diabetes mellitus3 have been examined before, which 
actually makes our study unique.
We defined LVH using ECG, not imaging (echocar-
diography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging). 
Although imaging provides a more accurate assess-
ment of LVH than ECG, any misclassification should 
have affected both arms equally, and hence, the effect 
should be balanced. Nevertheless, significant nondif-
ferential misclassification of LVH could affect our abil-
ity to estimate the true mediation of LVH, which could 
explain the marginal attenuation of the CVD risk as-
sociated with intensive BP after adjustment for LVH 
as a time-varying covariate. More important, LVH de-
tected by ECG has been shown to be predictive of 
poor outcomes in a similar way as LVH detected by 
imaging.36–39 These findings, along with its wide avail-
ability and low cost, have made ECG the ideal tool 
for the initial evaluation of patients with hypertension 
to detect LVH.40 In a related point, we decided to use 
Cornell voltage to define LVH because of its simple cal-
culation that incorporates sex-specific cutoff points. 
As one of the most commonly used LVH criteria, it has 
had good diagnostic performance in multiethnic set-
tings compared with other LVH criteria and high prog-
nostic significance as a predictor for CVD events,41 and 
it is not affected by obesity.42 Because there are several 
other LVH criteria, it could be argued that our results 
should be applied only to Cornell voltage LVH. How-
ever, we performed sensitivity analyses using 3 other 
commonly used LVH criteria (Cornell voltage product, 
Sokolow-Lyon, and Minnesota Code ECG classifica-
tion) and observed similar results. Furthermore, the 
current recommendations for the use of ECG criteria 
for detecting cardiac chamber enlargement18 do not 
favor or recommend one set of LVH criteria over the 
other (ie, any LVH criteria could be used as long as 
specifically named). Therefore, using Cornell voltage 
or another criterion should serve the purpose and be 
in accordance with these recommendations.
Despite these limitations, this analysis is the first re-
port from a well-designed large clinical trial in which the 
effect of intensive BP lowering on LVH in patients with 
hypertension without diabetes mellitus is examined. The 
strengths of our study include large sample size, racially 
diverse population with representation of both sexes, in-
clusion of a large proportion of patients >75 years old, 
random assignment of participants to treatment arms 
resulting in balanced groups at baseline, standardized 
data collection including ECG data that were centrally 
read, and achievement and maintenance of the intended 
differences in SBP between arms throughout the study.
Conclusions
In patients with hypertension but no diabetes mel-
litus, intensive BP lowering (target <120 mm Hg) re-
duces the risk of LVH by preventing the development 
of new LVH in those without LVH and causing the 
regression of LVH in those with existing LVH. This fa-
vorable impact on LVH, however, does not explain 
most of the reduction in CVD events associated with 
intensive BP lowering in SPRINT. These findings add 
further evidence of the benefits of the intensive BP 
lowering in patients with hypertension and suggest 
that these benefits go beyond reducing the hemody-
namic stress on the cardiac structure. Understanding 
the mediating factors and the mechanisms by which 
intensive BP lowering affects the cardiovascular sys-
tem would help in better selection of those who may 
benefit with least harm.
