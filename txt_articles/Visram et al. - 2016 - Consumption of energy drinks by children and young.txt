ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine patterns of energy drink
consumption by children and young people, attitudes
towards these drinks, and any associations with health
or other outcomes.
Design: Rapid evidence assessment and narrative
synthesis.
Data sources: 9 electronic bibliographic databases,
reference lists of relevant studies and searches of the
internet.
Results: A total of 410 studies were located, with 46
meeting the inclusion criteria. The majority employed a
cross-sectional design, involved participants aged
11–18 years, and were conducted in North America or
Europe. Consumption of energy drinks by children and
young people was found to be patterned by gender,
with boys consuming more than girls, and also by
activity levels, with the highest consumption observed
in the most and least sedentary individuals. Several
studies identified a strong, positive association
between the use of energy drinks and higher odds of
health-damaging behaviours, as well as physical health
symptoms such as headaches, stomach aches,
hyperactivity and insomnia. There was some evidence
of a dose–response effect. 2 experimental studies
involving small numbers of junior athletes
demonstrated a positive impact on limited aspects of
sports performance. 3 themes emerged from the
qualitative studies: reasons for use; influences on use;
and perceived efficacy and impact. Taste and energy-
seeking were identified as key drivers, and branding
and marketing were highlighted as major influences on
young people’s consumption choices. Awareness of
possible negative effects was low.
Conclusions: There is growing evidence that
consumption of energy drinks is associated with a
range of adverse outcomes and risk behaviours in
terms of children’s health and well-being. However,
taste, brand loyalty and perceived positive effects
combine to ensure their popularity with young
consumers. More research is needed to explore the
short-term and long-term impacts in all spheres,
including health, behaviour and education.
Trial registration number: CRD42014010192.
INTRODUCTION
Energy drinks are non-alcoholic beverages
that typically contain high levels of caffeine
(>150 mg/L) and sugar in combination with
other ingredients known to have stimulant
properties. They are marketed explicitly as a
way to relieve fatigue and improve mental
alertness, in contrast with sports or isotonic
drinks which are intended to help athletes
rehydrate after exercise. There are implicit
claims that energy drinks promote a more
active and healthy lifestyle, in spite of the
British
Soft
Drinks
Association
(BSDA)
pledging that they ‘will not be marketed as
sports beverages which deliver a rehydration
benefit’.1 Between 2006 and 2014, consump-
tion of energy drinks in the UK increased
by
155%,
from
235
to
600 million
L.2
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is the first independent review of the scien-
tific literature relating solely to the consumption
of energy drinks by children and young people.
▪ Key strengths include the comprehensiveness of
the searches, the systematic study selection
process and rigorous synthesis methods used.
▪ The inclusion of qualitative research exploring
children and young people’s views, alongside
quantitative studies on health and other effects,
helps to enhance the relevance of the findings
for the design and evaluation of future policy
and practice interventions.
▪ The strength of the conclusions is limited by the
quality of the individual studies, which varied due
to factors such as the sample sizes, cross-
sectional designs and reliance on self-report data.
▪ Few studies examined educational or social out-
comes, highlighting a need for further research
that examines the short-term and long-term
impact of energy drinks in relation to a wider
range of outcomes.

 This equated to a per capita consumption of 9.4 L and a
total value of £1.48 billion. Despite the growing energy
drinks market and media reports of serious adverse
events associated with their consumption, research into
their use and effects has been sparse. In 2011, the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) commissioned
a study to gather consumption data for energy drinks in
16 countries of the European Union.3 They found that
young people aged 10–18 years had the highest reported
consumption prevalence (68%), compared with adults
over 18 years (30%) and children under 10 years (18%).
On average, young people in the UK were found
to consume more energy drinks than their counterparts
in other EU countries (3.1 L/month in comparison
with 2.1 L).
The scientific literature focuses largely on the effects
of energy drink consumption in adults, who may experi-
ence temporary benefits such as increased cognitive
performance, enhanced mood, more physical energy
and promotion of wakefulness.4–7 However, evidence is
emerging on the harmful physiological and psycho-
logical effects of these drinks, and it is possible that
prolonged use may affect physical and mental well-
being.8 With children and young people, anecdotal evi-
dence suggests that those who regularly consume energy
drinks can become dependent on them and even mod-
erate consumption may be detrimental.9–11 Based on
the known effects of caffeine, consumption of energy
drinks may lead to: caffeine intoxication and withdrawal;
sleep disruption and insomnia; and disruptive, hyper-
active and risky behaviour.12–14 There are also likely to
be longer term health implications associated with exces-
sive sugar intake, such as dental erosion, obesity and
type 2 diabetes.15–18
Based on the importance and impact of energy drink
consumption outlined above, the objectives of this study
were to review the existing literature in order to:
(1) examine evidence of associations (if any) between
children and young people’s consumption of energy
drinks and their health and well-being, social, behav-
ioural or educational outcomes; (2) determine whether
the magnitude and direction of these associations vary
according to the quantity or frequency of energy drinks
consumed and (3) explore children and young people’s
attitudes towards energy drinks and, in particular, what
factors motivate them to consume or to abstain from
consuming these drinks.
METHODS
We undertook a time-limited review of the literature
following the guidance on rapid evidence assessments
(REAs).19 REAs aim to be rigorous and explicit in
method, but make concessions to breadth or depth by
limiting particular aspects of the review process; for
example, less exhaustive use of ‘grey’ sources and a pref-
erence for electronically available texts. Rapid or prag-
matic reviews have been shown to produce similar results,
more quickly and at a lower cost when compared with sys-
tematic reviews, suggesting that the approach employed
here was useful and valid.20 21
Search methods
Searches of the following major bibliographic databases
were undertaken: ASSIA, CINAHL, Cochrane Library,
DARE, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web
of Science. We also conducted searches of OpenGrey
and the internet using Google to locate grey literature.
Specific search strategies were employed for each data-
base. See box 1 for lists of the key terms used. The
results of each search were exported to an independent
database using EndNote 7 software. These databases
were subsequently merged into a single unique database
and duplicates were removed automatically.
We adopted an inclusive approach to locating original
and review articles published between January 2000 and
April 2016 that examined the consumption of energy
drinks by children and young people aged 0–18 years
(or up to 20 years if still in secondary education). This
period was chosen to reflect the time when major
brands became widely available; for example, Red Bull
was introduced in the USA in 1997 and Monster was
created in 2002. The inclusion of studies was not
restricted according to outcome type or study setting,
although we excluded studies that only involved college
or university students. Animal studies, articles not pub-
lished in English and studies focusing on individual
ingredients (eg, caffeine or taurine) rather than energy
drinks as a whole were excluded. We also excluded
opinion pieces, editorials and descriptive papers without
empirical findings.

 Study selection
Titles of studies identified from the searches were
scanned by two researchers to make an initial assessment
of relevance. In cases where there was any doubt,
abstracts were retrieved in order to make a further
judgement. Where possible, we obtained the full text of
all references included after the title/abstract screening
stage and PDF files were added to the bibliographic
database. Articles deemed potentially relevant were
reviewed independently by two researchers based on the
inclusion criteria. Any disagreements (26 in total) were
resolved by discussion between the researchers, with
referral to a third member of the team where necessary.
Information regarding the eligibility of a reference—
relevant or not relevant—was recorded in the database
to monitor the screening process. The process is sum-
marised in the study selection flow chart (figure 1).
Quality assessment
Formal appraisal of eligible studies was undertaken using
the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies
developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project
(EPHPP) and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme
checklist for qualitative studies.22 23 Both checklists have
been widely used in previous systematic reviews and allow
for rapid evaluation of study quality. Each paper was inde-
pendently appraised by two researchers and disagree-
ments (four in total) were resolved through discussion to
reach an overall judgement concerning the quality of the
available evidence (strong, moderate or weak). Studies
rated as weak were excluded from the review. The six pre-
vious reviews located through our searches were either
judged to be of insufficient quality to provide reliable evi-
dence or they included studies involving adults or non-
human animals, making it difficult to extract results relat-
ing specifically to children and young people.12 13 24–27
However, they contributed to the identification of rele-
vant primary studies.
Data extraction
Eligible studies were divided between members of the
research team. Data were then extracted onto a template
by the lead researcher for each study. Variables to be
extracted included: bibliographic information; country
of origin; study setting; methods; participant character-
istics; outcomes; time frame; and results of the critical
appraisal. This information was stored in a Microsoft
Access database. As the object was to explore all possible
health, behavioural, educational and social impacts of
energy drink consumption, data were extracted on any
outcomes and measures used in the studies.
Data synthesis
A quantitative synthesis proved to be inappropriate due
to the heterogeneity of study designs, contexts and out-
comes. Data from all studies that met the inclusion and
quality criteria have therefore been descriptively sum-
marised and narratively synthesised. Narrative synthesis
relies primarily on the use of text rather than statistics to
‘tell the story’ of the findings from the included
studies.28 This method is often used to increase the
chances of the findings of a review being used in policy
and practice. In the present review, the main narratives
concerned the reported effects of energy drink con-
sumption and the experiences and attitudes of young
consumers, clearly related to the stated objectives.
RESULTS
Study characteristics and quality
Forty-two quantitative studies and four qualitative or
mixed method studies met our inclusion criteria. The
quantitative studies included 31 cross-sectional surveys,
four longitudinal studies, four papers reporting retro-
spective analyses of national or regional poison centre
data and three experimental studies (tables 1–4). Most
(n=38) explored the use of energy drinks by young

Independent variables conferring a
higher likelihood of being at least
once-a-week ED consumers were
smoking and alcohol consumption.
Awareness of the damage caused by
EDs emerged as a protective factor
that reduced the likelihood of young

44% of adolescents used EDs at

of boys used them daily, 0.5%
several times a day)
Daily use of EDs was strongly
associated with the four health
symptoms. In adjusted models,
health symptoms among those who

Effects of energy drink consumption
Consumption patterns and associations with health-related
behaviours
Cross-sectional survey data suggest that the use of energy
drinks is patterned by gender, with several studies indi-
cating that boys were more likely to report consumption
than girls, and in greater quantities.29–46 Larson et al33
found a significant association between regular con-
sumption and lower frequency of breakfast for girls only,
while Bryant Ludden and Wolfson36 found that girls
were more likely than boys to report expectations around
appetite suppression. Patterns of use according to age
were
less
clear
cut,
with
some
studies
showing
that consumption levels increased with age32 38 40 46–50
and
others
demonstrating
that
the
converse
was
true.29 43 48 51 Mixed racial and ethnic patterns were also
identified. Martz et al found that black students were less
likely to consume energy drinks than their white or
Hispanic counterparts, whereas other studies have sug-
gested that consumption levels are highest among black,
Hispanic and/or Aboriginal students.44 48 52 Higher con-
sumption levels were positively associated with being
underweight or obese, being from a single parent family,
receiving free school meals, having special educational
needs and higher spending money.44
46
48–50 Young
people with higher academic averages, higher sense of
coherence, higher levels of parental monitoring and
more educated parents were less likely to consume
energy drinks.14 41 48 53 54
The main health-related behaviours found to be posi-
tively and consistently associated with energy drink con-
sumption were use of alcohol and/or binge drinking,
smoking or susceptibility to smoking and other substance
use.14 30 33 34 38 39 41 47 55–57 Recent longitudinal studies
have found that the use of energy drinks at baseline pre-
dicted either number of drinking days or frequency of
alcohol consumption at follow-up (12 or 16 months).53 58
Furthermore, young people who consumed alcohol
mixed with energy drinks were more likely to feel and be
perceived as more intoxicated, and to have greater odds
of driving violations and accidents, after controlling
for all other factors.59 60 Consumption of energy drinks
has been linked to sensation-seeking,29 38 39 53 57 self-
destructive
behaviour,39
problems
with
behavioural
regulation and metacognitive skills,61 and poor lifestyle
behaviours,49 including regularly eating junk food or fast
food.46 52 Al-Hazzaa et al62 found that energy drink use
was associated with increased sedentary behaviour and
with higher levels of physical activity. This finding was
reinforced by Larson et al33 and Park et al,52 who found

 that energy drink use was correlated with hours spent
watching TV or playing video games, and Azagba et al48
and Nowak and Jasionowski,43 who found that consump-
tion was more likely among young people who partici-
pated in sports, suggesting a link with diverse leisure
activities.
Detrimental health and other effects
Using a representative sample of Finns aged 12–18 years,
Huhtinen et al31 found that daily use of energy drinks
was strongly associated with four health symptoms: head-
ache, sleeping problems, irritation and tiredness/fatigue.
Those who used energy drinks several times a day were
4.5 times as likely to experience headaches and 3.5 times
as likely to experience sleeping problems, in comparison
with those who did not consume these drinks. However,
a more recent study found that the relationship between
energy drinks and health symptoms was partly mediated
through going to bed late.63 A similar survey of 10–12
years in Iceland found that prevalence of physical symp-
toms such as headaches, stomach aches and sleeping
problems generally increased with greater energy drink
use for boys and girls, although the frequency of these
symptoms was less common among boys on all occasions
(p<0.001).42 Other cross-sectional studies have demon-
strated positive correlations between energy drink con-
sumption
and
sleeping
problems,46
61
self-reported
medical treatment for an injury,57 odds of sustaining a
recent or lifetime traumatic brain injury41 and hyper-
activity/inattention symptoms.45
The link between adverse health outcomes and inges-
tion of energy drinks is supported by routinely collected
poison centre data from Australia and the USA.64–66
However, these are based on self-report data and the
numbers are relatively small. For example, 62 children
(mean age 36 months) who had accidentally ingested
energy drinks were reported to the New South Wales
Poisons Information Centre between 2004 and 2010.65
Fourteen had symptoms probably related to energy
drink consumption—most commonly hyperactivity—and
nine required assessment in hospital. In the USA, 4854
calls (0.2%) received by the National Poison Data
System in 2010–2011 were for energy drink exposure
cases.64 Almost half (46%) were under 6 years, but older
children reported the largest proportion of moderate or
major effects, such as cardiac rhythm disturbances,
hypertension and hyperthermia.
Impact on sports performance
Of the three experimental studies identified through
the review, two measured the effects of a commercially
available energy drink on aspects of sports performance
in junior athletes. Pre-exercise ingestion of an energy
drink significantly improved handgrip force, running
pace at high intensity and number of sprints during a
simulated match among tennis players,67 and enhanced
jump performance, mean leg muscle power output, per-
ception of muscle power and perceived endurance
among basketball players.68 However, it did not have any
influence on mean running pace, peak running speed
or ball velocity in the first study, or the precision of bas-
ketball shots, number of free throws per second or dis-
tances covered by the players in the second study.
During the simulated tennis match, sweat rate was
slightly higher in the experimental group, producing sig-
nificantly higher dehydration (p<0.05).67
Attitudes towards energy drink consumption
Three major themes emerged through our analysis of
the qualitative or mixed method studies and relevant
survey results: reasons for use; influences on use and
perceived efficacy and impact.
Reasons for use
Taste was consistently reported as the primary driver
motivating the purchase and consumption of energy
drinks, with energy-seeking emerging as an important
but secondary driver.69–72 Participants involved in sports,
particularly boys, reported using energy drinks as stimu-
lants to enhance their sports performance. Others
described using energy drinks as an alternative to soft
drinks but only when they had enough money, as they
were reported to be more expensive. Typical responses
included: “Wakes you up, makes you feel alert and it
tastes nice”; “It makes me go hyper” and “I drink it
before soccer and I don’t lose energy as fast”.72 Jones71
explored perceptions of alcohol-energy drinks (AEDs)
among 12–17 years and suggested that young people
liked them because they increased the ‘fun’ at parties
and acted as a ‘pick me up’. They also found that the
packaging of AEDs (to look like soft drinks) was a factor,
particularly for younger teenagers and girls.
Influences on use
Advertising and brand loyalty emerged as major influ-
ences on young people’s use of energy drinks, with parti-
cipants reporting seeing them advertised on TV, the
internet, through games promotions, via sports sponsor-
ship and in shops. In a focus group study involving three
age groups (16–21, 22–28 and 29–35 years), industry
marketing was seen to target specific drinks at men or
women,
using
sexualised
imagery
and
humour.69
Participants in the youngest age group appeared to be
more conscious than those in the older groups of the
social image they were portraying in their choices, as
well as being more sensitive to peer influences when
making
purchasing
decisions.
Social
situations—and
spending
time
with
friends—provided
a
common
context for energy drink consumption across the studies.
Parents also played a key role in influencing partici-
pants’ use of energy drinks, either by disapproving and
prohibiting or encouraging and endorsing their use.70 It
was generally agreed that energy drinks were easily
accessible, from convenience stores or supermarkets,
provided by parents, shared by siblings or friends, or
obtained free at sponsored events.

 Perceived efficacy and impact
Energy drinks were perceived to confer various benefi-
cial effects on young people’s bodies and their sports
performance. Participants in one study described short-
term health benefits, prevention of illness, improved
immunity and a desire to rectify a poor diet.72 Others
described scenarios where adults used energy drinks to
effectively alleviate tiredness related to work, travel or
family commitments, leading Costa et al70 to suggest that
these drinks were ‘normalised and perceived as neces-
sary to meet the demands of a busy lifestyle’ (p. 187).
Few participants across the studies raised any negative or
harmful effects, suggesting young people were either
unaware of, or chose to ignore, the possible risks.
Negative consequences associated with using AEDs were
perceived to relate to the inclusion of a stimulant and
depressant in one drink, and difficulties sleeping after
consumption.71 In the study by Bunting et al,69 more
negative connotations became apparent in the older,
adult age groups (22–28 and 29–35 years), who dis-
played greater scepticism as to whether energy drinks
were safe. However, concerns regarding sugar content
emerged across all groups and moderation was stressed
due to the perceived risks of overconsumption, as
opposed to general consumption of energy drinks. The
youngest age group (16–21 years) believed these drinks
were safe as they would not be on sale if caffeine levels
were too high. Findings from other studies highlight
limited knowledge of the ingredients of energy drinks,
particularly among younger participants.70 71
DISCUSSION
Summary of principal findings
This review set out to examine evidence of any associa-
tions between children and young people’s health and
well-being,
social,
behavioural
and
educational
out-
comes, and their consumption of energy drinks. It also
sought to explore consumer experiences and attitudes
towards these drinks.
The evidence demonstrates that the use of energy
drinks by children and young people is associated with a
number of
adverse
outcomes
and
health-damaging
behaviours. A total of 410 studies were located, with 46
meeting our inclusion criteria. Two randomised con-
trolled trials demonstrated that pre-exercise ingestion of
an energy drink had a positive impact on some aspects
of sports performance. However, both studies involved
small numbers of elite junior athletes and the results
should therefore be treated with some caution. Several
cross-sectional studies indicated that energy drink use by
children and young people was strongly and positively
associated with higher rates of smoking, alcohol and
other substance use, as well as being linked to physical
health symptoms such as headaches, stomach aches,
hyperactivity and insomnia. Two studies provided some
evidence of a dose–response effect, although none of
the studies was able to determine causality. Use was
found to be patterned by gender, with boys consuming
more energy drinks than girls, and also by age, although
there was some disagreement between studies on the
direction of the association. Interestingly, the highest
consumption levels have been observed in sedentary
individuals and in physically active individuals, suggest-
ing a link with sport as well as screen-based leisure activi-
ties. Previous qualitative studies have reported perceived
beneficial effects on young people’s bodies and sports
performance, with little mention of any negative effects
and limited knowledge of energy drink ingredients
among participants. Taste and energy-seeking were iden-
tified as key drivers for consumption. Advertising and
brand loyalty have been highlighted as major influences
on young people’s attitudes towards energy drinks, and
peers, parents and siblings were also found to play an
important role.
Comparison with other studies
This is the first comprehensive review of the scientific
literature to focus exclusively on evidence relating to the
consumption of energy drinks by children and young
people. Previous reviews have tended to examine the
benefits and risks associated with specific energy drink
components, such as sugar or caffeine. These studies
provide important insights but fail to account for the
fact that the presence of other substances such as
guarana, ginseng and taurine in variable quantities may
generate uncertain interactions and exacerbate any
risks.73 In addition, there is an established biochemical
interaction between energy drink contents and alcohol,
resulting in physical and psychological side effects and
increased risk-taking behaviour.74
75 The aforemen-
tioned EFSA study found that more than half of young
energy drink consumers (53%) reported co-consump-
tion with alcohol.3 Qualitative studies suggest that young
adults use energy drinks to continue partying and drink-
ing alcohol over a longer period, and that they may
experience negative effects ranging from difficulty sleep-
ing to being admitted to hospital.76 77 Further evidence
is provided by the numerous clinical case reports relat-
ing to young people receiving emergency treatment for
overconsumption of energy drinks with or without
alcohol in recent years (for examples, see:78–82).
Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by chil-
dren and young people has been shown to result in
greater weight gain, increased body mass index and
higher incidence of type 2 diabetes.18 83 A review on the
suitability of caffeinated drinks for children found that
high caffeine intakes (>5 mg/kg body weight per day)
were associated with an increased risk of anxiety and
withdrawal symptoms.84 However, evidence from adult
studies and expert panels was used to suggest that rela-
tively small amounts of caffeine may benefit cognitive
function and sports performance, as well as contributing
to daily fluid intakes. Furthermore, the author was a
paid member of the Tea Advisory Panel and the work
was funded by the UK Tea Council. Several other studies

24–27 A report by the Committee on
Nutrition and the Council on Sports Medicine and
Fitness in the US raises concerns about the uninten-
tional (through the use of energy drinks for rehydra-
tion) and intentional (through the use of energy drinks
to
combat
fatigue)
ingestion
of
potentially
large
amounts of caffeine and other stimulant substances.12
They suggest that paediatricians have a role to play in
educating children and parents on the differences
between sports and energy drinks, and to counsel that
routine ingestion of sugar-sweetened beverages should
be avoided or restricted.
Strengths and limitations of the study
The strengths of our review include the comprehensive-
ness of our searches, the systematic study selection
process and rigorous synthesis methods used. The review
was undertaken by a multidisciplinary team of independ-
ent academic researchers. The inclusion of qualitative
research exploring children and young people’s views on
energy drinks, alongside quantitative studies on health
and other effects associated with their consumption,
helps to enhance the relevance of the findings for the
design and evaluation of future policy and practice
interventions.
As with any literature review, the strength of our con-
clusions is limited by the quality of the individual
studies, which varied. The small sample sizes in the
experimental and retrospective studies, reliance on self-
report data in many of the observational studies and
small number of qualitative studies located are all limita-
tions of the review. Very few of the included studies
examined educational or social outcomes, highlighting a
need for further research that examines the short-term
and long-term impact of energy drinks in relation to a
wider range of outcomes. Almost half of the studies were
conducted in North America and most involved high
school students rather than younger children. Owing to
time and resource constraints, we excluded non-English
language publications and may not have identified all
unpublished studies.
Conclusion and policy implications
This review adds to the growing evidence base on the
health effects associated with energy drink consumption
and suggests that there may be more negative than
positive implications for children and young people.
However,
factors
such
as
taste,
brand
loyalty
and
perceived beneficial effects help to enhance their popu-
larity among young consumers. Consideration of the
patterns and reasons for energy drink consumption
identified in this review may help future interventions to
ensure appropriate behaviours are targeted and are rele-
vant to the population. Gender was identified as an
important factor, in combination with gendered market-
ing and perceived links to sports performance, particu-
larly among
boys.
The
challenge
for
policies
and
interventions that seek to address this issue is to recog-
nise the complexities of children and young people’s
consumption choices. Although health education target-
ing individuals is unlikely to achieve a substantial impact,
definitive information about the safety of energy drink
consumption should be provided by healthcare and
other professionals, who may in turn need guidance, for
example, from the UK National Institute of Health and
Care Excellence (NICE). More research is needed to
explore the longer-term health impacts, given that child-
hood and adolescence are critical yet understudied
periods in the development of health-related behaviours.
The potential effects of heavy and long-term energy
drink consumption on child development, behaviour and
educational outcomes also warrant further study.
