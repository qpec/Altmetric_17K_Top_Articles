 challenge for systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and computational 
analysis using a temporal mixtures of Gaussian processes model, termed GPfates, we 
reconstructed the developmental trajectories of Th1 and Tfh cells during blood-stage Plasmodium 
infection in mice. By tracking clonality using endogenous TCR sequences, we first demonstrated 
that Th1/Tfh bifurcation had occurred at both population and single-clone levels. Next, we 
identified genes whose expression was associated with Th1 or Tfh fates, and demonstrated a T-cell 
intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting a Th1 differentiation. We also revealed the close 
molecular relationship between Th1 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells in this infection. Th1 and Tfh 
fates emerged from a highly proliferative precursor that upregulated aerobic glycolysis and 
accelerated cell cycling as cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene expression of chemokine 
receptors around bifurcation predicted roles for cell-cell in driving Th1/Tfh fates. In particular, we 
found that precursor Th cells were coached towards a Th1 but not a Tfh fate by inflammatory 
monocytes. Thus, by integrating genomic and computational approaches, our study has provided 
two unique resources, a database www.PlasmoTH.org, which facilitates discovery of novel factors 
controlling Th1/Tfh fate commitment, and more generally, GPfates, a modelling framework for 
characterizing cell differentiation towards multiple fates.
Introduction
CD4+ T cells are key instructors of the immune system. They can display extensive 
phenotypic and functional diversity, by differentiating into a range of T helper (Th) subsets 
including Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Th22, Treg and Th9 cells, that are distinguished mainly by 
cytokine and transcription factor expression profiles. Since Th cells can control infections 
and drive immune-mediated diseases there remains tremendous interest in the molecular 
mechanisms that mediate their in vivo differentiation.
Malaria, caused by the protozoan parasite Plasmodium, afflicted 212 million humans in 
2015 (1). Both Th1 responses (2) and Tfh-dependent antibody responses (3) can 
independently protect against malaria, and are elicited simultaneously in malaria-infected 
individuals (4), as well as in mice challenged with rodent-infective strains such as P. 
chabaudi chabaudi AS (PcAS) (5). However, the molecular relationships between Th1 and 
Tfh cells remain unclear during Plasmodium infection, and more generally during any 
immune challenge. A recent study has demonstrated that the unique T cell receptor of a 
naïve CD4+ T cell imparted a strong preference for either a Th1 or Tfh fate (6). 
Nevertheless, for many clones both fates could still emerge, implying that other 
mechanisms, such as internal stochasticity and cell-extrinsic factors also govern fate choices 
in vivo. Transcription factors including T-bet, Gata3, RORγT and Bcl6 have been reported 
to drive and stabilize Th fates, leading to their characterisation as “lineage-defining” 
molecules. This has tended to present Th differentiation as a choice between mutually 
exclusive linear pathways. However, transient co-expression of these transcription factors, 
e.g. of Bcl6/T-bet, and Foxp3/RORγT suggests that overlapping intermediate Th states also 
exist in vivo. Moreover, substantial heterogeneity occurs in the kinetics of CD4+ T cell 
responses, resulting in a complex mixture of intermediate states during differentiation, 
which is not easily resolved via assessment of a small number of molecules.

 Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are the dominant initial source of antigenic signalling to 
naïve CD4+ T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues, for example in the spleens of 
Plasmodium-infected mice (7). In other models, it was shown that cDCs made long-lasting 
stable contacts with naïve CD4+ T cells to initiate priming (8). Once activated, CD4+ T cells 
regained motility, permitting further cellular interactions. Consistent with this observation, 
activated CD4+ T cells required further antigenic stimulation to optimize clonal expansion 
and Th differentiation (9); cDC were considered the most likely candidates, (8, 10), with 
other cell types remaining less explored. Studies of mice with altered monocytic responses 
suggested roles for these cells in CD4+ T cell priming, specifically in tissues with few cDCs 
(11). Other reports employed cDC-deficiency to illustrate that monocytes could activate 
naive CD4+ T cells (12). However, few in vivo studies have explored roles for monocytes in 
Th differentiation where cDC responses remain intact.
Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study Plasmodium-specific TCR 
transgenic CD4+ T (PbTII) cells during blood-stage PcAS infection in mice. We then 
employed a computational modelling strategy to reconstruct the molecular trajectories of 
Th1 and Tfh cells. Finally, we investigated cell-cell interactions based on dynamic 
expression of chemokines and their receptors, and examined roles for inflammatory 
monocytes in supporting activated CD4+ T cells towards a Th fate.
Results
scRNA-seq resolves Th1 and Tfh cell fates during Plasmodium infection in mice
We used scRNA-seq to elucidate the development and heterogeneity of Th1 and Tfh cells 
during PcAS infection (Figure 1A, Figure S1). We transferred naïve, proliferative dye-
labeled PbTII cells into congenic wild-type mice, and recovered them at days 2, 3, 4, and 7 
post-infection (p.i.) by cell sorting those expressing the early activation marker, CD69, or 
displaying dilution of the proliferative dye (Figure S2). Flow cytometric measurements of 
the canonical Th1 markers, T-bet (coded by Tbx21) and Interferon-γ, and Tfh markers, 
CXCR5 and Bcl6, indicated that these subsets emerged in parallel by day 7 p.i. (13, 14) 
(Figure 1B-D and S3). Notably, markers of Th2, Th17 or Treg subsets were not upregulated 
by PbTII cells (Figure S4).
Initially, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to explore the overall transcriptomic 
landscape of the PbTII cells (Figure S5A). The top principal components were strongly 
associated with the number of detected unique transcripts (reflective of mRNA content and 
proliferative status (Figure S5B)), and differentiation (Figures S5C and S6-7, Table S1). As 
expected, the variability related to previously established Th1 and Tfh gene expression 
signatures became more prominent with time, separating two subpopulations at day 7 (15) 
(Figure 1E-1F). Taken together, these results suggested a progressive commitment to Th1 
and Tfh fates, and indicated that single-cell transcriptomes could be used for estimating both 
proliferative states and degrees of differentiation of individual cells.

 Delineation of Th1 and Tfh trajectories using a Mixture of Gaussian Processes model
The results from the PCA suggested that variation in PbTII transcriptomes could be used to 
reconstruct the transcriptional programs that is underlying the Th1 and Tfh differentiation. 
To more explicitly model the temporal dynamics of this differentiation process, we 
developed GPfates, a temporal mixture model that builds on the Gaussian Process Latent 
Variable Model (GPLVM) (16) and Overlapping Mixtures of Gaussian Processes (OMGP) 
(17). Briefly, this approach is based on first reconstructing the differentiation trajectory from 
the observed data (“pseudotime”, Figure 2A-B), thereby establishing an order for the cells. 
While our model uses the sample time as prior information, the inferred orderings did not 
strictly adhere to the experimental time points (Figure S8). For example, cells from day 4 
p.i. were mixed with some of the cells from day 3 and day 7 at either end of the day 4 
pseudotime distribution. This result is consistent with the idea that bulk assessments of cells 
at specific time points fail to account for the heterogeneity and differential kinetics of 
responses made by single cells. To assess the robustness of the established ordering, we 
repeated this analysis without supplying the experimental sampling times to the model, 
finding overall consistent results (Comp. Supp. Figure 8).
In a second step, GPfates uses the inferred temporal orders as input for a non-parametric 
time series mixture model (OMGP, (17)). This approach revealed two simultaneous trends 
emerging during pseudotime (Figure 2C-D), which separated from each other, indicating 
that a developmental bifurcation occurred.
In a third step, GPfates employs a change point model (Section 4.2 of the Computational 
Supplement), thereby facilitating to annotate pseudotime after bifurcation. The cell fate split 
appeared to initiate amongst early day 4 p.i. cells (in pseudo time, Figure 2C-D), an 
inference that was robust when using bootstrapped subsets of cells (Section 6.2 of 
Computational Supplement).
We found that differentially expressed genes between the identified trajectories were in 
agreement with known Th1/Tfh signature genes (15) (Figure 3A-B, and S9), strongly 
suggesting that the fitted mixture components corresponded to cells with Th1 and Tfh 
phenotypes. Notably, these bifurcation trends could not be identified by other published 
methods for reconstructing bifurcating single-cell trajectories (18–22) (Comp. Supp. Figure 
14). We also successfully applied GPfates to resolve bifurcation events in other published 
datasets, (Comp. Supp. Figure 11) (23, 24) (Comp. Supp. Figure 12), suggesting that our 
approach is more generally applicable for studying cellular differentiation using scRNA-seq 
data.
Lineage barcoding using endogenous TCR sequences reveals Th1/Tfh bifurcation from 
single CD4+ T cells
While the TCR transgenic approach employed in this study minimized the influence of TCR 
sequence variability on cell fate determination (6), the strain was Rag-sufficient, thus 
retaining potential for expression of diverse endogenous TCR chains in addition to the 
transgenic TCR. Sequence analysis of TCR transcripts in single PbTII cells confirmed 
universal expression of the PbTII Vα2 and Vβ12 chains (Supplementary Tables 2 & 3), as 
Lönnberg et al.

 well as highly diverse, though lower levels of expression of endogenous TCRα chains in 
many cells (Figure S10). Importantly, Rag-sufficient PbTII cells differentiated as effectively 
as Rag1-/- PbTII cells into both Th1 and Tfh cells (Figure S11), indicating that endogenous 
TCR sequences had not influenced Th fate bifurcation.
Given the vast combinatorial diversity of the endogenous TCR sequences, we employed 
these as unique molecular barcodes to identify ancestrally-related PbTII clones. We 
identified six clones comprising multiple sibling cells. Of these, two consisted of sibling 
cells that mapped close to the bifurcation point. For the remaining four clones, siblings 
exhibited highly diverging patterns of differentiation, with three sibling pairs falling at the 
extremities of the Th1-Tfh phenotype spectrum (Figure 3C). These results demonstrated that 
Th1/Tfh bifurcation had occurred at both population and at single clone levels in our system, 
with the progeny of a single cell populating both Th1 and Tfh compartments.
Transcriptional signatures associated with bifurcation of Th1 and Tfh fates
Next, we sought to identify genes whose expression differed between the Th1 and Tfh 
branches. We derived a bifurcation statistic to estimate the concordance with bifurcation for 
individual genes (see section 4.2 of the Computational Supplement text for details, Figure 
3D). Among the highest-ranking genes, the most common pattern was up-regulation along 
the Th1 branch (Figure 3D). This suggested that Tfh cells were in fact developmentally 
closer to the shared progenitor state than Th1 cells, since the Th1 fate involved up-regulation 
of numerous genes not expressed in either the progenitor or Tfh states.
To validate the robustness of these gene signatures and the timing of the bifurcation, we 
repeated the infection, and at days 0, 4 and 7 sequenced additional PbTII cells using the 
Smart-seq2 protocol (Figure 1A & S12A). A non-linear dimensionality reduction indicated 
that the single cells from both experiments populated similar transcriptional landscapes 
(Figure S12B) and that the subset-characteristic co-expression patterns of the bifurcating 
genes identified by GPfates emerged by day 7 (Figure S12C). Notably, the day 7 cells from 
each mouse could be separated into distinct Th1 and Tfh subpopulations using the top 
bifurcating genes (Figure S12D). These results indicated that the bifurcation-associated gene 
expression patterns were reproducible across experiments and sequencing platforms.
The highest-ranking transcription factors for the bifurcation included Tcf7 for the Tfh fate, 
and Id2 for the Th1 fate (Figure 3D & 3E). Tcf7 is required for T cell development, and has 
been recently shown to be instrumental for Tfh differentiation (25, 26). It also represented 
one of the rare genes defined by a decrease in expression when moving towards the Th1 fate. 
Id2 is an antagonist of Tcf7 and was recently identified as a key driver of Th1 responses 
(27). As expected, the hallmark Tfh transcription factor Bcl6 was also strongly associated 
with the Tfh fate. In Th1 cells, many bifurcating genes encoded immune-related receptors 
(Figure 3D-E), such as Cxcr6 (Figure S13A and S13B), Ifngr1 and S1pr1, which mediate 
egress from secondary lymphoid organs. This was consistent with the notion that Th1 cells 
can migrate to peripheral tissues and remain receptive to external signals. In contrast, the 
only bifurcating chemokine receptor associated with a Tfh fate was Cxcr5, which is 
important for trafficking into B cell follicles (28).

 Many of the bifurcating genes had no known role in Th differentiation. For example, lgals1 
(encoding Galectin-1), a molecule generally implicated in cDC (29) and Treg function (30), 
was unexpectedly upregulated in PbTII cells around bifurcation, and maintained along the 
Th1, but not the Tfh trajectory (Figure S14A). This observation was confirmed at protein 
level (Figure S14B). Next, comparison of Th1/Tfh fates in co-transferred WT and lgals1-/- 
PbTII cells during PcAS infection (Figure S14C) revealed a specific role for Galectin-1 in 
supporting Th1 but not Tfh fate (Figure S14D). Together, these data illustrate the potential 
for the GPfates model to enable identification of factors controlling Th1 and Tfh fates. 
Further examination of bifurcating genes is facilitated by the online database, 
www.PlasmoTH.org, accompanying this paper (Figure 3F).
Coinciding with Th1/Tfh differentiation, we also noted up-regulation of Il10 particularly in 
the Th1 branch (Figure S15A). Most of the Il10-expressing cells also expressed Ifng at equal 
or higher levels as those expressing Ifng alone (Figure S15B-C). These data revealed the 
development of Tr1 cells, defined as IL-10/IFNγ co-expressing CD4+ T cells. Given that 
Il10 expression was associated with the Th1 branch, this suggested that Tr1 cells were 
developmentally related to Th1 cells. Surprisingly, we found that aside from Il10, only two 
genes, Trib2 and BC017643, were differentially expressed between Il10/Ifng co-expressing 
Tr1 cells and Ifng-expressing Th1 cells (Figure S15D). Furthermore, a comparison of gene 
expression frequencies between Tr1 and Th1 cells, revealed a substantial degree of similarity 
across the genome (Figure S15E). Together these data strongly suggest that Tr1 cells derive 
directly from Th1 cells during blood-stage Plasmodium infection.
Pseudotemporal relationships between cell cycling, aerobic glycolysis and cytokine 
expression
Clonal expansion, increased aerobic glycolysis, and cytokine expression, are hallmarks of 
Th cell development whose temporal relationships with each other remain to be fully 
resolved in vivo. We noted that PbTII cells became highly proliferative around bifurcation, 
as shown by the upregulation of Mki67 (Figure 4A-B and S16A) and other known 
proliferation marker genes (31) (Figure S16B). This correlated with cell cycle activity, as 
inferred from the scRNA-seq data using the Cyclone tool, and confirmed by flow cytometric 
measurements of DNA content and cell size (Figure 4C-D, Figure S16C). On Day 4 p.i., the 
cells also increased expression of genes associated with aerobic glycolysis but not oxidative 
phosphorylation (Figure 4F), an indication of increased metabolic requirements being met 
by glucose metabolism and increased mTORC1 activity. Consistent with this was the 
observed elevated levels of ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation on day 4 p.i. (Figure 4E).
By day 4 p.i., PbTII cells had gone through several rounds of cell division with differing 
kinetics, and with some cells expressing IFNγ. By comparing Ifng-expressing and non-
expressing cells on day 4 p.i., we noted that early Ifng-expressing cells cycled faster and 
expressed aerobic glycolysis genes more highly than non-cytokine expressing counterparts 
(Figure 4G). Taken together, our data suggest that around bifurcation, PbTII cells exhibited a 
highly proliferative and metabolically active state, with those cells cycling fastest and 
exhibiting most glycolytic activity being the first to acquire the capacity to secrete IFNγ.

 Gene dynamics identifies potential decision-making molecules
To elucidate how PbTII cells transitioned from the proliferative precursor state to Th1 and 
Tfh fates we sought to resolve the hierarchy of gene expression before and during cell fate 
bifurcation. In addition to genes directly following the bifurcation trend, we reasoned that 
expression of genes encoding key decision-making molecules might also be likely to be 
dynamic and peak prior to the bifurcation. To identify these, we selected those genes 
displaying interesting non-linear trends in their expression patterns over pseudotime by 
Gaussian Process regression. This was achieved firstly via a D-statistic (model likelihood 
ratio) where each gene’s expression pattern over pseudotime was tested for variation 
unexplained by random noise (32). Based on the D-statistic (> 50.0, figure 5C) we identified 
2061 dynamic genes (Figure 5A). Secondly, we ordered these genes according to their peak 
expression time to provide a temporal overview (Figure 5A), and noted that a substantial 
fraction of them peaked around bifurcation. These included the Th1-driving genes Tbx21, 
Il2ra, and Il2rb, supporting our initial hypothesis. Moreover, cells around bifurcation also 
transcribed the highest number of genes compared to those at all other points in pseudotime 
(Figure 5B).
This model also infers the lengthscale of the dynamic model, namely the degree of fast-
acting behaviour over pseudotime (Figure 5C). Using this additional feature, we noted 
roughly equivalent dynamics for Tbx21, Il2ra and Il2rb. Furthermore, we noted similar 
dynamics, though with slightly later peak times, for the chemokine receptors, Cxcr5 and 
Cxcr3. Closer examination of all chemokine receptor genes also revealed peak expression 
around bifurcation for Ccr4, but not others (Figure S17). Given that Cxcr5 and Cxcr3 have 
been associated with Tfh and Th1 cells, respectively (10, 33, 34), and since they exhibited 
similar dynamics, we hypothesized these were competing receptors that directly influenced 
Th1/Tfh fate (Figure 5D). Indeed, assessment of Cxcr3/Cxcr5 co-expression around 
bifurcation revealed a substantial portion of cells expressing both receptors (Figure S18). 
Thus, our examination of gene expression dynamics revealed large numbers of genes being 
expressed and peaking around bifurcation, including not only those associated with clonal 
expansion, but also numerous sequentially-expressed transcription factors and receptors with 
potential to influence Th fate.
Monocytes support activated PbTII cells towards a Th1 but not a Tfh fate
Given similar dynamics and peak expression times for Cxcr3 and Cxcr5, and peak 
expression around bifurcation for Ccr4 (Figure S17), we reasoned that cell-cell interactions 
via these receptors controlled Th1/Tfh fate. Hence we considered cell-types that could 
control Th fate, specifically around bifurcation. Since B cells supported a Tfh fate (Figure 
S19), we hypothesized that co-ordinated action by myeloid cells provided competing signals 
to support a Th1 fate.
To study this, we examined splenic cDCs and inflammatory monocytes prior to PbTII 
bifurcation. We sorted CD8α+ and CD11b+ cDCs and Ly6Chi monocytes from naïve and 
infected mice (Figure S20) and performed scRNA-seq. PCA of cDCs distinguished the two 
naïve cell types along PC2 (Figure 6A & S21) with an efficiency consistent with recent data 
(35), and further highlighted a number of expected and previously unknown cDC subset-

 specific genes (Figure S22). We next compared naïve cDCs with those from infection 
(Figure 6A & S21), and separated these along PC6 (Figure 6A). Analysis of differential gene 
expression in cDCs due to infection identified 30 genes, 29 of which were upregulated 
(Figure 6B & S23), including transcription factors Stat1 and Irf1, and CXCR3-attractant 
chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10. Notably, gene expression patterns amongst individual cDCs 
varied according to the gene. For example, Stat1 and Irf1 were expressed by several naïve 
cDCs, and further upregulated during infection (Figure 6C). This was similar for Cxcl9, 
which was expressed by CD8α+ cDCs in naive mice, while Cxcl10 was induced only upon 
infection (Figure 6C). These data suggested interactions between cDCs and uncommitted 
CXCR3+ PbTII cells, consistent with a recent study (10). Next, PCA of Ly6Chi monocytes 
from naïve and infected mice distinguished them from each other along PC2 (Figure 6D & 
S24). Differential gene expression analysis between naïve and infected groups uncovered 
~100 genes, both up- and down-regulated during infection (Figure 6E & S25). A high 
proportion (~40%) of genes upregulated in cDCs were also induced in Ly6Chi monocytes, 
including Stat1, Irf1, and Cxcl10 (Figure 6E & F), suggesting possible overlapping 
functionality. In addition, monocytes expressed other chemokines, including Cxcl2, Ccl2 
and Ccl3 (Figure 6E & F). Furthermore, specific examination of all immune cellular 
interaction genes (Figure S26) revealed emerging variable expression of Tnf, Cd40, Pdl1, 
Ccl4, Ccl5, Cxcl16, Cxcl9 and Cxcl11 in monocytes, thus suggesting complex cell-cell 
interactions for Ly6Chi monocytes during infection.
Since Cxcl9-11, Ccl2, Ccl3 and Ccl5 signal through Cxcr3 or Ccr4, which were expressed 
by activated PbTII cells, we next hypothesized that Ly6Chi monocytes, in addition to cDCs 
(10), interacted with PbTII cells and influenced Th1/Tfh fate. To test this, we first assessed 
chemokine expression at protein level by Ly6Chi monocytes (Figure 6G). Kinetics of 
CXCL9 production was similar in cDCs and Ly6Chi monocytes. Next, we employed 
LysMCre x iDTR mice, in which Ly6Chi monocytes were depleted after PbTII cell activation, 
but before bifurcation (Figure 6H, Figure S27). We noted a modest reduction in CD68+ 
splenic macrophages using this approach (Figure S27B). Using this approach, we found that 
monocytes/macrophages supported a Th1 but not a Tfh fate (Figure 6H). Together, our data 
support a model in which activated, PbTII cells are supported towards either a Tfh fate by B 
cells (Figure S19), or a Th1 fate by chemokine-expressing myeloid cells, including Ly6Chi 
inflammatory monocytes.
Discussion
By capturing single CD4+ T cell transcriptomes during an experimental malaria infection, 
and computationally reconstructing the course of events, we have resolved the bifurcation of 
naïve CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Tfh cells at a molecular level. Importantly, GPfates 
modelling of scRNA-seq data is not limited to immune cells or single bifurcation events. 
This model can also be combined with existing computational workflows, including 
alternative methods to estimate pseudo-temporal dynamics (19, 36) (see section 5.2 of the 
Computational Supplement). The GPfates approach permits analysis of cellular 
differentiation towards two fates (Comp. Supp. Figure 11), and in principle, towards 
multiple fates (Comp. Supp. Figure 12). However, GPfates exhibits some limitations. Most 
notably, the ability to identify and time bifurcation events is linked to changes in the

 transcriptome that reflect these cellular decisions. In particular, because scRNA-seq profiles 
are subject to high levels of noise, this means that changes will only be detectable with some 
lag time (Computational Supplement). The processed expression data and the GPfates model 
presented in this study can be accessed at www.plasmoTH.org, where users can visualise 
their genes of interest.
Our data provide the framework for revealing molecular insights into the early stages of Th 
cell differentiation, and describe the sequence of transcriptional events before and after the 
bifurcation of Th1 and Tfh fates. Transcriptomic profiling previously suggested 
developmental similarities between Tfh and Th1 cells (37). However, highly immunogenic 
viral or bacterial infections induced CD4+ T cells to segregate into Bcl6+ (Tfh) or Blimp-1+ 
(Th1) subpopulations within two days (38, 39). In our parasitic model, single CD4+ T cell 
transcriptomes remained remarkably similar until four days of infection. Although it is 
difficult to directly compare infection models, we speculate that Plasmodium infection in 
mice may not drive Th bifurcation as early as observed with highly immunogenic viruses or 
bacteria, particularly given evidence of immune-suppression (40).
IL-10-producing Tr1 cells can suppress immune responses, which could aid the treatment of 
immune-mediated disorders (41), or be detrimental for chronic infections (42). Despite this, 
their relationship to Th1 cells is not clear (43). In our model, Tr1 cells emerged from the Th1 
trajectory. This observation, coupled with similar transcriptomes for Th1 and Tr1 cells 
provides evidence that Tr1 cells are highly related to, and derive directly from Th1 cells in 
this model. Thus, our modelling of scRNA-seq data revealed molecular relationships 
between Th1, Tr1 and Tfh cells, and showed that a single naïve CD4+ T cell can 
simultaneously give rise to more than one cell fate during experimental malaria.
Activated CD4+ T cells may experience different microenvironments within secondary 
lymphoid tissue. The observation that bifurcation towards Th1 and Tfh fates was preceded 
by upregulation of chemokine receptors prompted us to investigate possible cell-cell 
interactions with chemokine-expressing myeloid cells. Previous studies have highlighted the 
potential for cDCs in lymph nodes to produce Th1-associated chemokines (10). Our study, 
which focused on the spleen further implicated inflammatory monocytes in Th1 support. 
However, since our transgenic approach for depleting monocytes also removed a small 
portion of splenic red pulp macrophages, we cannot fully discount the possibility that they 
may partly contribute to a Th1 fate. Nevertheless, we propose that splenic monocytes/
macrophages influence bifurcation by supporting a Th1 fate during Plasmodium infection. 
Our studies emphasise that although cDCs are key for initiating CD4+T cell activation in the 
spleen, other myeloid cells can also promote a Th1 fate in the presence of cDCs. In contrast, 
given that CXCR5 was the only chemokine receptor significantly associated with bifurcation 
towards a Tfh fate, cellular interaction with B-cell follicles may be the primary mechanism 
for supporting a Tfh fate. Our model proposes that activated, uncommitted CD4+ T cells 
become receptive to competing chemoattractant signals from different zones of the spleen, 
and suggests intercellular communication as a major driver of bifurcation. However, 
upstream of these processes, internal stochasticity in uncommitted CD4+ T cells may control 
the balance of chemokine receptor expression. Future experiments combining our integrated 
single-cell genomics and computational modelling with in vivo positional and trafficking

Materials and Methods
Study design
The goal of this study was to use scRNA-seq to capture the transcriptomes of individual 
splenic PbTII cells at various time points during the first week of a blood-stage PcAS 
infection. Multiple mice were used for most time points to test for possible batch effects, 
with an independent experimental repeat performed on a different scRNA-seq platform. 
scRNA-seq data was modelled using Gaussian processes, with statistical testing for 
significance of both genes and cells associated with the Gaussian processes.
Experimental mice and infections
Wild-type and transgenic inbred mouse strains were housed, and employed in blood-stage 
Plasmodium infections, as described in the supplementary materials and methods.
Flow Cytometry
Splenocytes were isolated and assessed by flow cytometry as described in the supplementary 
materials and methods.
Single-cell mRNA sequencing
Single-cell capture and processing, as well as quality control analysis of scRNA-seq data 
was performed as described in the supplementary material and methods.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were conducted using R, or Python, or GraphPad prism. The types of 
statistical tests and significance levels are described in respective figure legends.

 Figure 2. GPfates modelling of bifurcation processes using scRNA-seq data.
(A) Overview of the analysis workflow that underlies GPfates, consisting of dimensionality 
reduction of high-dimensional single-cell transcriptomes (left), inference of a pseudo 
temporal ordering of the cells (middle) and the reconstruction of trajectories using temporal 
mixture modelling (right). These individual steps build on models derived using the 
Gaussian process framework. Once fitted, GPfates enables for different downstream 
analyses, including cell orderings, bifurcation time point estimates and inference of the 
genes that drive bifurcation events.

infected mouse, and (D-F) Ly6Chi monocytes from naïve and infected mice were analysed 
by scRNA-seq, with mRNA reads filtered by minimum expression of 100 TPM in at least 2 
cells. (A& D) PCA showing clustering of (A) cDCs or (D) monocytes. (B & E) Fold-change 
and confidence for differentially expressed genes (19) between infected and naive (B) cDCs 
or (E) monocytes; genes filtered on expression in >10 cells; genes satisfying qval < 0.05 are 
colored per function. (C& F) Differentially expressed genes (qval<0.05) in (C) cDCs and (F)

 monocytes, between naive and infected mice: cells and genes are ordered according to PC 
score and loading respectively. Common genes between heatmaps are annotated in (F). (G) 
Representative FACS histograms and proportions of splenic CD8α+ cDCs, CD8α- cDCs and 
Ly6Chi monocytes expressing CXCL9 in naive and infected mice; data shows individual 
mice with line at mean, and is representative of two independent experiments (n=4 mice/
time point/experiment). (H) PbTII cells were transferred into LysMCre x iDTR mice 1 day 
prior to infection. At 3 days p.i., mice were treated with diphtheria toxin (DT) or saline. 
Proportions of Th1 (T-bethiIFNγ+) and Tfh (CXCR5+) PbTII cells at 7 days p.i.; data pooled 
from three independent experiments (n=5-6/experiment). Statistics: Mann-Whitney U Test. 
****p<0.0001; NS, not significant. (I) Summary model proposing chemokine interactions 
between non-bifurcated PbTII cells and myeloid cells support a Th1 fate, while B cells 
support a Tfh fate.
