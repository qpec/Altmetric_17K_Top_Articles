ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is defined by a dilated and impaired left ventricle due to chronic
excess alcohol consumption. It is largely unknown which factors determine cardiac toxicity on exposure to alcohol.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the role of variation in cardiomyopathy-associated genes in the patho-
physiology of ACM, and to examine the effects of alcohol intake and genotype on dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) severity.
METHODS The authors characterized 141 ACM cases, 716 DCM cases, and 445 healthy volunteers. The authors
compared the prevalence of rare, protein-altering variants in 9 genes associated with inherited DCM. They evaluated the
effect of genotype and alcohol consumption on phenotype in DCM.
RESULTS Variants in well-characterized DCM-causing genes were more prevalent in patients with ACM than control
subjects (13.5% vs. 2.9%; p ¼ 1.2 �10�5), but similar between patients with ACM and DCM (19.4%; p ¼ 0.12) and with a
predominant burden of titin truncating variants (TTNtv) (9.9%). Separately, we identified an interaction between TTN
genotype and excess alcohol consumption in a cohort of DCM patients not meeting ACM criteria. On multivariate analysis,
DCM patients with a TTNtv who consumed excess alcohol had an 8.7% absolute reduction in ejection fraction (95%
confidence interval: �2.3% to �15.1%; p < 0.007) compared with those without TTNtv and excess alcohol consumption.
The presence of TTNtv did not predict phenotype, outcome, or functional recovery on treatment in ACM patients.
CONCLUSIONS TTNtv represent a prevalent genetic predisposition for ACM, and are also associated with a worse left
ventricular ejection fraction in DCM patients who consume alcohol above recommended levels. Familial evaluation
and genetic testing should be considered in patients presenting with ACM. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2018;71:2293–302)

 A
lcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is
caused by chronic and excessive
alcohol intake (1–4). Although mod-
erate levels of alcohol consumption may
have some beneficial cardiovascular effects
(3,5), prolonged and excessive consumption
can
lead
to
deleterious
consequences
including cardiac arrhythmias and a dilated
cardiomyopathy
(DCM)
phenotype
(2–5).
The pathophysiology of ACM is not fully un-
derstood, and the relationship between the
degree of alcohol exposure and severity of end-
organ damage is not simple (2,6). In particular, not
all individuals
with high alcohol intake develop
ACM, and this heterogeneity in response indicates
differences in underlying susceptibility, likely both
genetic and environmental. However, studies of her-
itable contributors to ACM are currently
limited
(7,8). Prognosis in ACM is poor, but is considered
more favorable than DCM generally, with recovery
observed in up to one-third of cases, especially
when alcohol intake is reduced (3). Current manage-
ment
of
ACM
individuals
includes
cessation
of
alcohol exposure, standard heart failure medications,
and prevention of sudden cardiac death (2,6,9). As
the genetic contribution to ACM is currently un-
known,
familial
evaluation
is
not
part
of
ACM
management.
DCM is estimated to affect up to 1 in 250 in-
dividuals (10) and has a significant genetic contribu-
tion, with truncation variants in the gene encoding
titin (TTNtv), a key sarcomeric protein, representing
the predominant genetic cause, seen in 10% to 20% of
cases (11–13). It is also recognized that up to 1% of the
general population carry a TTNtv, presenting a sig-
nificant
challenge
to
interpretation
(12).
Genetic
and/or
environmental
factors
likely
underlie
the
variable penetrance and expressivity. In line with
this, recent evidence has shown that over 10% of
patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy carry a
TTNtv, suggesting that in some patients, the DCM
phenotype results from a combination of pregnancy
with a genetic predisposing background (14).
Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that
TTNtv
found
in
the
general
population
are
not
phenotypically silent (15); although the population
prevalence of TTNtv exceeds the prevalence of DCM,
careful phenotyping reveals differences in cardiac
volumes in subjects with and without TTNtv. Using a
rat model, we found essentially normal resting car-
diac function, but subclinical metabolic abnormalities
in TTNtv carriers and impaired cardiac physiology
under conditions of cardiac stress (15). Together,
these data suggest that TTNtv may predispose to
cardiomyopathy, with environmental factors modu-
lating penetrance and expressivity.
Here, we sought to evaluate genetic determinants
in the pathophysiology of ACM by characterizing ge-
netic variation in known DCM-causing genes in a
large ACM cohort. We sequenced 141 individuals with
ACM and compared these with healthy volunteers
(n ¼ 445), individuals with DCM (n ¼ 366), and
population-based
variant
frequency
data
(Exome
Aggregation Consortium [ExAC]; n ¼ 60,706). We
further evaluated the phenotypic effect of excessive
alcohol intake (below the levels required for a diag-
nosis of ACM) in the context of TTNtv in a wider
cohort of 716 DCM subjects.
METHODS
The study conformed to the ethical principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
local institutional review board of Hospital Uni-
versitario Puerta de Hierro and a National Health
Service Health Research Authority Research Ethics
Committee. All patients provided written informed
consent.

 ACM CASES. A total of 141 unrelated patients with
ACM (Table 1) were recruited for this study from 6
Spanish hospitals. ACM was defined as DCM with a
history of prolonged and heavy alcohol consumption:
that is, a self-reported history of alcohol intake of
>80 g/day over a period of at least 5 years (2,3,6),
with excess intake continuing up to no <3 months
before initial diagnosis of ACM, in combination with
DCM defined by established criteria of left ventricular
dilation and reduced ejection fraction in the absence
of coronary artery disease (invasive or computed to-
mography angiographic evidence of >50% stenosis in
any major epicardial coronary artery, or previous
percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary ar-
tery bypass grafting) or abnormal loading conditions
(uncontrolled hypertension or significant primary
valvular disease). Outcome information was collected
until last available follow-up, or at death or trans-
plantation, and follow-up time was truncated at 12
years.
Although
a
specific
program
for
alcohol
discontinuation was not provided, complete absti-
nence from alcohol was recommended to all ACM
patients. Endpoints were pre-specified as: 1) death or
cardiac transplantation; and 2) recovery defined as an
absolute increase in left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) $10% to a final value of $40% (16). Survival
analyses measured time from diagnosis (first assess-
ment in heart failure clinic) to first event. Although
genotype, which defined groups for comparison in
survival analysis, was ascertained retrospectively,
both clinical care and outcome adjudication were
blinded to genotype.
DCM CASES. A total of 716 consecutive patients with
DCM confirmed by late gadolinium enhancement car-
diac magnetic resonance were prospectively enrolled
in
the
Royal
Brompton
Hospital
Cardiovascular
Research Centre Biobank between 2009 and 2015 as
previously described (17). DCM was diagnosed based
on established criteria of left ventricular dilation and
reduced ejection fraction with reference to age- and
sex-adjusted nomograms (18) in the absence of known
coronary artery disease (defined as presence of sub-
endocardial late gadolinium enhancement suggestive
of previous myocardial infarction or >50% stenosis in
any major epicardial coronary artery or previous
percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary ar-
tery bypass grafting) or abnormal loading conditions
as for ACM. The complete 716 DCM cohort was evalu-
ated for phenotypic correlates of TTN genotype and
alcohol exposure (described in the following text), and
a subset of 366 unrelated cases that were matched
both technically and by ethnicity with the ACM cohort
were used for comparative genetic analysis.

VOLUNTEERS. A

of
445
healthy

self-reported
cardiovascular
disease or a family history of disease were recruited
prospectively via advertisement to the U.K. Digital

All
participants
underwent
clinical
assessment, including cardiac magnetic resonance, to

ANALYSIS. See the Online Methods in the Online
Appendix for full details on sequencing, variant
filtering, and annotation. In brief, sequencing was
carried
out
using
the
Illumina

kit
(San

California)
(19)
or
a
custom Agilent SureSelect XT target capture (Santa
Clara, California) with similar content and run on
Illumina
platforms
or
Life
Technologies
5500XL
(Waltham, Massachusetts). Rare (ExAC filtering allele
frequency [20] <8.4 � 10�5) protein-altering variants
were identified in genes and variant classes proven
to be robustly associated with DCM (Online Table 1).
In the case of titin, analysis was further restricted to
truncating variants in exons constitutively expressed
in the heart as described (12). Although the Illumina
TruSight Cardio sequencing kit captures 61 genes
purportedly associated with DCM (full gene list and
variants detected are given in Online Table 7), we
decided
to
be
conservative
and
pre-specified
a
focused analysis on 9 genes with the most robust
evidence of disease association (TTN, DSP, MYH7,
LMNA, TTNT2, TCAP, SNC5A, BAG3, and TNNC1) and
compared the prevalence of rare protein-altering
variants
in
subjects
who
were
matched
both
technically
(TruSight
Cardio
panel

platform [both Illumina]) and by ethnicity (self-
reported

[see Online Methods in the Online Appendix]). The
9 genes assessed are those with a demonstrated
excess of rare variation in DCM clinical cohorts over

EVALUATION
OF
ALCOHOL
AS
A
PHENOTYPIC
MODIFIER IN DCM. We investigated the effect of
alcohol consumption on phenotype in DCM patients
using
self-reported
weekly
consumption
together
with a review of hospital and primary care medical
records for a history of alcohol excess prior to study
recruitment. No patients had a history of prolonged
heavy alcohol consumption for a diagnosis of ACM.
“Excess alcohol consumption” in DCM was defined as
a binary variable indicating a history of consumption
>21 U/week for men and >14 U/week for women (1 U
of alcohol ¼ 10 ml or 8 g of pure alcohol, an amount
the average adult metabolizes in 1 h) (22), levels
representing the “sensible limits” for alcohol con-
sumption from U.K. consensus medical advice (23)
from 1987 to 2016.
Univariable linear regression was performed to
identify
variables
predictive
of
LVEF
at
study
recruitment. LVEF was measured while blind to
genotype. Variables with p < 0.10 in univariable
analysis were included in a multivariable model,
which was then optimized by reverse stepwise se-
lection
until
only
significant
variables
were
included. The pre-specified main analysis assessed
the
significance
of
an
interaction
term
between
TTNtv and “excess alcohol consumption” added to
this
optimized
multivariable
model
predicting
LVEF,
to
determine
whether
TTNtv
and
alcohol
consumption in combination have any additional
effect
beyond
the
effects
of
TTNtv
and
alcohol
separately. A p value #0.05 was considered statis-
tically significant.
Statistical analyses were conducted in the R envi-
ronment, version 3.0 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing,
Vienna,
Austria).
All
data
and
code
required to reproduce these analyses are available
online (24).

 genes to ACM, we examined cases for the presence of
rare protein-altering variants in 9 genes known to
cause DCM that were selected according to their
previously reported excess of rare variants in DCM
compared with control subjects (21). The frequency of
variants was then compared between ACM cases,
technically and ethnically matched DCM cases, and
healthy volunteers (n ¼ 141, n ¼ 366, and n ¼ 445,
respectively) (cohort characteristics are shown in
Table 1). We identified 20 distinct variants in 19 ACM
cases involving 4 different genes (Table 2, Online
Tables 2 and 3A and 3B). The prevalence of variants
in ACM was significantly higher than in healthy vol-
unteers (13.5% of ACM cases carry at least 1 variant vs.
2.9% of healthy volunteers; p ¼ 0.000012), but not
statistically different from the prevalence in the DCM
cohort (19.4%; p ¼ 0.12). The rate in healthy volun-
teers was as expected for the general population
(Online Table 2). TTNtv accounted for the majority of
variants detected in ACM cases (9.9%) and were
found with a frequency similar to that seen in DCM
(12.0%; p ¼ 0.64), and significantly higher than in
control subjects (0.7%; p ¼ 4.4 � 10�7). In line with
studies in DCM (10–12,15), TTNtv found in ACM were
in exons constitutively expressed in the heart and
distributed across the gene (Online Figure 1) with 13
of 14 being novel (i.e., absent from previous DCM
cases, healthy volunteers, and ExAC).
We identified 6 ACM cases with rare, protein-
altering variants in other DCM genes: 1 carrying a
BAG3 truncating variant previously reported in DCM
(25) and classified as pathogenic for DCM under cur-
rent
variant
interpretation
guidelines
from
the
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics
and the Association for Molecular Pathology (Online
Tables 3A and 3B) (26), 1 carrying a novel BAG3
missense variant, 1 carrying both a TTNtv and a novel
LMNA missense mutation, and 3 cases each carrying
different MYH7 variants.
There were no detectable differences in phenotype
or
demographics
between
ACM
cases
with
and
without TTNtv (Table 3, Online Table 4), with the
notable exception of family history of cardiomyopa-
thy. On follow-up (overall mean follow-up ¼ 5.9 � 5.2

ALCOHOL AS A PHENOTYPIC MODIFIER IN DCM.

proportion of cases, primarily driven by TTNtv, we
investigated
the
interaction
between
TTNtv
and
alcohol consumption in the context of DCM but in the
absence of prolonged and heavy alcohol consumption
meeting criteria for ACM. A total of 111 of 716 DCM
cases (15.5%) had a history of excess consumption
(above U.K. guidelines, see the Methods section).
These individuals were more likely to be male, and in
univariate
analyses
had
modestly
reduced
LVEF
(median: 37.0% vs. 41.0%; p ¼ 0.02) and right ven-
tricular ejection fraction (median: 48.0% vs. 54.0%;
p < 0.001) compared with DCM patients without a
history
of
excess
alcohol
consumption
(Online
Table 5). A total of 83 DCM cases carried a TTNtv
(11.6%). The presence of a TTNtv alone did not predict
LVEF. In multivariable analysis accounting for co-
variate predictors of baseline LVEF, neither TTNtv
nor
excess
alcohol
consumption
were
significant
predictors in isolation, but patients with both TTNtv
and excess alcohol consumption (n ¼ 13) had a sta-
tistically
significant
and
biologically
important
reduction in LVEF (Figure 2, Online Tables 6A and
6B), with an 8.7% absolute reduction (95% confi-
dence interval: �15.1 to �2.3; p ¼ 0.007) compared
with DCM with neither TTNtv nor excess alcohol
consumption.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates an important genetic pre-
disposition to ACM. We present a large series of ACM
patients genotyped for variants in 9 genes associated
with inherited DCM, and identified rare, protein-
altering variants in 19 of 141 ACM cases (13.5%), a
frequency significantly higher than that observed in
healthy volunteers (2.9%; p ¼ 0.000012) and popu-
lation controls (ExAC, 4.3%; p ¼ 0.0000059), but
similar to that seen in DCM cases (19.4%; p ¼ 0.12)
(Central Illustration). Our findings demonstrate that in
a proportion of ACM subjects, the disease has a ge-
netic etiology.
The data presented here indicate that patients with
alcohol-related cardiomyopathy should undergo a 3-
generation pedigree and should be considered for
familial evaluation, such as clinical screening and
genetic testing, to identify family members at risk for
developing DCM (in line with current practice for
idiopathic DCM).
An illustration of the utility of genetic management
in ACM is shown in Figure 3, where familial evaluation
identified several individuals with DCM, and molec-
ular genetic testing enabled informed genetic coun-
seling including reproductive advice. This reveals the
importance of recognizing genetic disease and famil-
ial assessment, although future work will be needed
to more fully understand the risk associated with ge-
netic variants found in the absence of overt familial
disease, to balance the costs and benefits associated
with genetic testing and clinical surveillance, and to
allow for fully informed genetic counseling.
We further identified a direct interaction between
TTNtv and alcohol consumption in the context of

 typical DCM: cases with a TTNtv and excess alcohol
consumption
have
a
markedly
reduced
LVEF
compared with those with low alcohol intake. Taken
together, these 2 lines of evidence both support a
model whereby alcohol and cardiac genotype interact,
contributing both to the development of ACM and to
disease severity in the context of DCM (Central
Illustration). Although we acknowledge that many
factors may contribute to the development of ACM, we
identified an illustrative family where alcohol abuse
and TTNtv were present in multiple relatives and
probably acted in conjunction to promote disease ex-
pressivity in certain family members. In this pedigree,
all 3 affected individuals both carried the TTNtv and
reported
prolonged
heavy
alcohol
consumption,
whereas 2 individuals who reported prolonged heavy
alcohol consumption without the TTNtv and 3 in-
dividuals with the TTNtv but without excess alcohol
consumption were all free from DCM (Figure 3).
There is still much to understand. The molecular
mechanisms underlying ACM are not fully under-
stood, and this study only explores some of the ge-
netic factors that may influence susceptibility to
cardiomyopathy on exposure to alcohol. Although
there is strong evidence for an interaction between
alcohol and TTNtv, there is much more to learn about
the mechanisms underlying the variable penetrance
of TTNtv. In some families with DCM, TTNtv appear
highly penetrant and sufficient to cause disease in
isolation, but TTNtv are also seen in approximately
1% of the general population (12), a level well above
the prevalence of DCM and suggesting that other ge-
netic or environmental factors contribute to the car-
diomyopathic process (27).
The overall effect of alcohol on the occurrence of
DCM is also difficult to assess, but previous reports
have suggested that it may be involved in as many as
47% of cases (6), and a recent population-based study

ACM patients exhibit a higher prevalence of rare variants in DCM-associated genes than control subjects. In DCM patients, neither the
presence of a TTNtv nor excess alcohol consumption had a significant effect on baseline LVEF in isolation, but the combination was
associated with a significantly lower baseline LVEF. Values shown are absolute ejection fraction in each group. The p value is derived from
multivariate analysis. ACM ¼ alcoholic cardiomyopathy; DCM ¼ dilated cardiomyopathy; LVEF ¼ left ventricular ejection fraction;

(Top) Family 978: coexistence of ACM and DCM. The proband (arrow) was diagnosed with ACM and underwent cardiac transplantation. When genetic and clinical
familial evaluation was performed, multiple individuals without excessive alcohol consumption were diagnosed with DCM and found to carry TTN truncating variants.
(Bottom) Family 1016: combined effect of excessive alcohol consumption and genetic background. The proband (arrow) was diagnosed with ACM at age 44 years and
was identified as carrying a TTNtv variant (TTN c.64453C>T; p.R21485X). One brother and 1 sister with prolonged heavy alcohol consumption (red asterisk) and TTNtv
also show ACM. Two family members with TTNtv but no regular alcohol intake, and 2 individuals with prolonged heavy alcohol consumption but without TTNtv, did
not show cardiac involvement. Standard pedigree notation is used: squares and circles indicate male and female subjects, respectively, a strike-through indicates a
deceased individual, an arrow indicates the proband in each family, and filled symbols indicate affected individuals with ACM or DCM. Symbols containing an N
represent individuals confirmed as unaffected. D/L symbols indicate genetic evaluation: D indicates carry TTNtv; L are noncarriers, oD are obligate carriers.
Red asterisks indicate cases with documented prolonged heavy alcohol consumption. CTx ¼ cardiac transplant; DCM ¼ dilated cardiomyopathy; MI ¼ myocardial
infarction; SCA ¼ sudden cardiac arrest; VHD ¼ valvular heart disease; other abbreviations as in Figure 1.

 genetic factors, may account for a substantial pro-
portion of disease risk.
Additional environmental factors that may act in
concert with TTNtv include viral myocarditis (29),
nutritional deficiencies (30), recreational drug use
(31), and certain drugs (32). Our data therefore also
have wider potential implications both for lifestyle
choices and for exploring the potential interaction of
genetics with other environmental factors.
ACM has a poor prognosis, although somewhat
better than DCM overall (2,3). In the ACM cohort
studied here, of the 139 cases with outcome data, 62
(44.6%) showed functional recovery following heart
failure therapy and reduction in alcohol, 52 (37.4%)
remained stable but without functional recovery, and
25 (17.9%) died or received a cardiac transplant, in
agreement with recent studies (3,16). We saw no dif-
ference between TTNtv and non-TTNtv cases with
respect
to
outcome,
with
equivalent
proportions
showing improved cardiac function (50.0% vs. 45.8%,
respectively) (Table 3), indicating that the presence of
a TTNtv does not of itself preclude recovery. Func-
tional recovery in DCM resulting from TTNtv has been
previously reported both in severe end-stage failure
requiring LVAD support (33) and in milder cases
following
medical
therapy
(34).
Likewise,
we
observed no difference in survival analysis (freedom
from
death
or
cardiac
transplantation)
between
TTNtvþ and TTNtv� groups.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. First, in the absence of a cohort
with prolonged and heavy alcohol consumption but
no cardiomyopathy, our comparison of ACM and
healthy volunteers cannot formally exclude the pos-
sibility that TTNtv are associated with increased
alcohol consumption, rather than the development of
ACM on exposure to alcohol. However, this would
seem highly unlikely and cannot explain the observed
interaction between excess alcohol consumption and
TTNtv as predictors of severity in an independent
DCM cohort. Second, one might postulate that the
individuals with coincident ACM and TTNtv simply
represent conventional familial DCM: because pro-
longed heavy alcohol consumption is not uncommon
in the population, a proportion of DCM cases will be
exposed; thus, the TTNtv could be the causative
driver, and the alcohol consumption a coincidental
bystander. However, the positive cardiac response on
reduction
or
cessation
of
alcohol
points
to
an
etiological role of alcohol in the disease process, and
the observed synergistic interaction between genetic
predisposition and environmental toxin in the DCM
cohort once again points to a biological interaction.
Third, although the association between aggre-
gated rare variation in this gene set and ACM can be
robustly interpreted as demonstrating an etiological
role, the interpretation of specific variants in indi-
vidual patients often remains uncertain. Improve-
ment
in
clinical
variant
interpretation
would
substantially improve the utility of genetic testing in
cardiomyopathies more widely. We also restricted our
analysis to robustly validated DCM genes with a
published excess of rare variants in DCM compared
with control subjects. We acknowledge that rare
variants in other genes that might have a role in DCM
may make a further contribution to a genetic predis-
position to ACM.
Finally, self-reported alcohol consumption lacks
precision
and
is
likely
under-reported,
which,
together with modest cohort size, limits our power to
detect
modest
effect
sizes
on
phenotype
and
outcome, to evaluate the contribution of genes that
are more rarely variant, and to fully dissect the in-
teractions
between
genetic
and
environmental
influences.
CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that TTNtv represent an important
genetic predisposition to ACM, and that the combi-
nation of TTNtv and excess alcohol consumption is
associated with worse LVEF in DCM patients. These
findings support a model whereby alcohol and other
environmental
factors
interact
with
genotype
to
determine
the
cardiac
phenotype.
Furthermore,
based on our findings, familial evaluation and genetic
testing should be considered in patients presenting
with ACM.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Variants
in DCM-associated genes are more frequent in patients
with ACM than in the general population, and patients
with DCM and TTNtv who drink alcohol excessively are
more prone to decline in LVEF than those who drink less
or lack these genetic variants.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are
needed to understand how family history and genetic
testing can be used to identify patients at risk of devel-
oping ACM, and effectively employed in counseling and
other psychosocial interventions to reduce the incidence
of this form of DCM.
