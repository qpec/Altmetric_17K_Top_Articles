Background: The effect of systemic therapy on malignancy risk among patients with psoriasis is not fully
understood.
Objective: Evaluate the impact of systemic treatment on malignancy risk among patients with psoriasis in
the Psoriasis Longitudinal Assessment and Registry (PSOLAR).
Methods: Nested case-control analyses were performed among patients with no history of malignancy.
Cases were defined as first malignancy (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) in the Psoriasis Longitudinal
Assessment and Registry, and controls were matched by age, sex, geographic region, and time on registry.
Study therapies included methotrexate, ustekinumab, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) inhibitors.
Exposure was defined as 1 or more doses of study therapy within 12 months of malignancy onset and
further stratified by duration of therapy. Multivariate conditional logistic regression, adjusted for potential
confounders, was used to estimate odds ratios of malignancies associated with therapy.
Results: Among 12,090 patients, 252 malignancy cases were identified and 1008 controls were matched.
Treatment with methotrexate or ustekinumab for more than 0 months to less than 3 months, 3 months to
less than 12 months, or 12 months or longer was not associated with increased malignancy risk versus no
exposure. Longer-term ($12 months) (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.15; P = .01), but not
shorter-term treatment, with a TNF-a inhibitor was associated with increased malignancy risk.
Limitations: Cases and controls could belong to 1 or more therapy categories.
Conclusions: Long-term ($12 months) treatment with a TNF-a inhibitor, but not methotrexate and
ustekinumab, may increase risk for malignancy in patients with psoriasis. ( J Am Acad Dermatol

 Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflam-
matory
disease
that
affects
the
skin
and
has
important systemic manifestations.1,2 In the United
States, psoriasis affects nearly 7 million adults age
20 years or older.3 Results of observational studies
and a large meta-analysis have indicated that patients
with psoriasis have an increased risk for deve-
lopment
of
malignancies,
including
lymphoma
and
nonmelanoma skin cancer
(NMSC),
compared
with
those without psoriasis.4-10
Understanding
whether
the risk for malignancy is
attributable to the disease
state itself or to immunosup-
pressive systemic therapy is a
key
consideration
for
providers and patients. Data
quantifying
the
effect
of
treatment
on
malignancy
development on the basis
of long-term extensions of
clinical trials in psoriasis have not demonstrated
increased
risk
for
malignancy
with
tumor
necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) inhibitors (etanercept,
adalimumab, infliximab) or the antieinterleukin
12/23 antibody, ustekinumab.11-15 Although studies
regarding the risk for malignancy with other systemic
treatments
(eg,
methotrexate)
are
limited
in
psoriasis,
data regarding
malignancy
risk
with
long-term
exposure
to
a
TNF-a
inhibitor
in
rheumatoid arthritis and across immune-related
diseases (including psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s
disease) have led to mixed conclusions, with a few
studies indicating increased risk.16-22
The current study was conducted using data from
the
large,
disease-based
Psoriasis
Longitudinal
Assessment and Registry (PSOLAR) of patients with
psoriasis. Previous PSOLAR analyses using safety
surveillance methodologies and safety data from
smaller
registries,
including
Biobadaderm
and
PsoBEST,
suggest
no
association
between
use
of conventional systemic therapies or biologic
agents and malignancy.23-26 This comprehensive
case-control analysis assessed whether exposure to
commonly used systemic psoriasis therapies and
biologic agents is associated with an increased risk
for malignancy (excluding NMSC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Data source and study population
The study design and methodology of PSOLAR
have been detailed elsewhere.27,28 Briefly, the regis-
try (established in 2007) comprises a long-term,
prospective, observational cohort of patients with
moderate-to-severe psoriasis (aged $18 years) who
were receiving, or were candidates to receive,
systemic therapy (including phototherapy) at clinics
across North and South America and Europe.
Information related to demographic characteristics,
disease activity and severity, comorbidities, and
psoriasis medication use is
collected every 6 months.
Planned
follow-up
for
each patient is at least 8 years
from
registry
enrollment.
Governing
ethical
bodies
approved the registry proto-
col, and all patients provided
written informed consent. As
of the registry cutoff date for
this
analysis
(August
23,
2015), 12,090 registry parti-
cipants had been followed
for a median of 4.17 years,
with a maximum follow-up
of 8.2 years (total patient-
years [PYs], 48,870).
To calculate risk associated with study therapy, a
nested case-control analysis was performed. Cases
consisted
of
patients
with
newly
diagnosed
malignancy (other than NMSC) during PSOLAR
participation; malignancies in those with a history
of malignancy (other than NMSC) were excluded.
The date of first malignancy diagnosis is referred to
as the index date. Four randomly chosen control
patients were matched with each case by age at
index date (66 months), sex, geographic region, and
enrollment
date
(61
year).
The
duration
of
follow-up for each case was the difference between
index date and enrollment date. The index date for
the matched control was imputed as the enrollment
date for that control plus the index duration of
follow-up for the matched case. Matched controls
were selected without replacement.
Exposure assessment
For the primary analysis, exposure was defined
as
having
received
a
dose
of
study
therapy
within 1 year of the index date. Exposure was
further stratified by duration of therapy into 3
discreet categories for each study therapy: more
than 0 months to less than 3 months, 3 months to
less than 12 months, and 12 or more months. No
exposure (ie, no dose of study therapy within 1 year
of the index date) was referred to as 0 months.
Exposure to multiple therapies was allowed; patients
in each category could have been exposed to other
study or nonstudy therapies.
CAPSULE SUMMARY
d Systemic therapy may alter the risk for
malignancy in patients with psoriasis.
d Long-term ($12 months) treatment with
TNF-a inhibitor therapy, but not
ustekinumab or methotrexate, may
increase risk for malignancy.
d Consideration of malignancy risk
associated with individual treatments
will help clinicians make informed
therapeutic decisions.

 Malignancy outcomes
Malignancies were considered adverse events of
special interest in PSOLAR and were reported by the
treating dermatologist and subject to enhanced
follow-up efforts. Malignancies were defined as
events captured within the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (version 17.1) system organ
class (SOC) neoplasms benign, malignant, and
unspecified (including cysts and polyps). First
occurrences
of
malignancy
(excluding
NMSC)
during the registry participation were included
here; recurrences or second malignancies in the
same
patient
were
excluded.
Benign
events
within this SOC were excluded per study physician
review. Any event not categorized in this SOC was
considered out of scope. Reported malignancies
were coded to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities preferred terms, which were grouped
where appropriate, to represent each malignancy
subtype.
The
5
most
common
malignancies
presented in subanalyses were prespecified on the
basis of cumulative rates in all PSOLAR patients;
malignancies not captured in 1 of these 5 categories
were
pooled
as
‘‘other’’
malignancies
in
the
subanalyses.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using SAS software,
version
9.4
(SAS
Institute
Inc.,
Cary,
NC).
Characteristics were compared between cases and
matched controls using the Wald chi-square test.
Malignancy incidence rates were expressed per 100
PYs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate
conditional
logistic
regression
methodology,
adjusted for potential confounding variables known
to be associated with malignancy and to influence
the selection of the psoriasis therapy, was used to
estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI of
malignancy incidence, comparing varying durations
of therapy ([0 to\3 months, $3 to\12 months, or
$12 months) with no exposure (0 months). Potential
confounding variables tested for inclusion in the
model were ethnicity, family history of malignancy,
body mass index, smoking status, alcohol use,
number of comorbidities, psoriatic arthritis, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, duration of psoriasis,
severity of psoriasis, past psoriasis therapy (systemic
or phototherapy), and use of other study therapies
(eg, the OR for ustekinumab was adjusted for
methotrexate and TNF-a inhibitor use). Sensitivity
analyses were conducted by defining exposure as 1
or more doses of study therapy within 6 months or
24 months of the index date. We also performed a
prespecified sensitivity analysis (the most recent
therapy analysis), which attributed malignancy cases
only to the systemic therapy immediately preceding
the index date, and a post hoc sensitivity analysis
(the monotherapy analysis), which excluded cases
and controls with exposure to more than 1 therapy in
the year before index date.
RESULTS
Overall,
252
PSOLAR
participants
met
the
eligibility criteria for malignancy cases; 1008 controls
were matched (4:1) to the cases (Fig 1). The overall
incidence rate of first malignancy among patients
who did not have a history of malignancy (excluding
NMSC) was 0.55 per 100 PYs (95% CI, 0.48-0.62)
(total PYs, 46,041). The 5 most frequently occurring
malignancies were breast cancer (n = 40), prostate
cancer (n = 36), lung cancer (n = 29), melanoma
(n = 28), and lymphoma (n = 14). Individual
incidence rates were 0.09 per 100 PYs (95% CI,
0.06-0.12), 0.08 per 100 PYs (95% CI, 0.06-0.11), 0.06
per 100 PYs (95% CI, 0.04-0.09), 0.06 per 100 PYs
(95% CI, 0.04-0.09), and 0.03 per 100 PYs (95% CI,
0.02-0.05) for breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung
cancer, melanoma (including melanoma in situ), and
lymphoma,
respectively.
Other
malignancies
reported in more than 1 patient were colorectal
cancer (n = 14), other cancers (n = 13), endometrial
cancer (n = 9), bladder cancer (n = 8), pancreatic
cancer (n = 7), renal cancer (n = 6), thyroid cancer
(n = 6), hepatic cancer (n = 5), leukemia (n = 5),
esophageal cancer (n = 5), head and neck cancer
(n = 4), ovarian cancer (n = 4), sarcoma (n = 4),
myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 3), myeloma (n = 3),
carcinoid tumor (n = 2), and neuroendocrine cancer
(n = 2).
Table I compares patient characteristics of the 252
malignancy cases with those of the 1008 controls. As
expected,
some
patient
characteristics
differed
between cases and controls (ie, cases showed a
higher proportion with family history of malignancy,
less alcohol use, a higher proportion with 2
comorbidities, and greater use of phototherapy).
Demographics, disease characteristics, and prior
treatments were generally comparable between
patients who had exposure to study therapies and

 those who had no exposure, but some differences
were noted (Supplemental Tables I-III; available at
http://www.jaad.org).
Study therapy exposure and ORs are presented in
Table II and Fig 2. No overall increased risk for
malignancy was seen for methotrexate for any
duration of treatment (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 1.30
[0.34-5.01] for [0 months to \3 months, 1.01
[0.45-2.28] for $3 months to \12 months, and 0.98
[0.63-1.54]
for
$12
months)
relative
to
no
methotrexate treatment (Fig 2). Similarly, no overall
increased risk for malignancy was observed for
ustekinumab when compared with no ustekinumab
treatment for any duration of treatment (OR [95% CI]:
0.66 [0.14-3.07] for [0 months to \3 months, 1.12
[0.63-2.01] for $3 months to \12 months, and 0.98
[0.63-1.53] for $12 months). In the case of a TNF-a
inhibitor, although neither more than 0 months to
less than 3 months nor 3 months or more to less than
12 months of treatment increased malignancy risk
(OR [95% CI]: 2.05 [0.82-5.12] and 1.15 [0.63-2.09],
respectively), 12 or more months of treatment
yielded a statistically significantly higher risk for
malignancy
development
(OR,
1.54;
95%
CI,
1.10-2.15; P = .01) versus no TNF-a inhibitor
treatment.
When
the
adjusted
analysis
was
performed for 12 or more months of exposure to
an individual TNF-a inhibitor, the results were
not statistically significant for infliximab (OR, 1.01;
95% CI, 0.59-1.74; P = .9577), adalimumab (OR, 1.37;
95% CI, 0.93-2.02; P = 1.099), or etanercept (OR, 1.37;
95% CI, 0.94-2.01; P = .1007). However, the point
estimates were elevated and the lower limits of the CI
was close to 1 for adalimumab and etanercept,
suggesting possible elevated risk (Supplemental
Table IV; available at http://www.jaad.org).
When each of the 5 most common malignancies in
PSOLAR was considered individually, there was no
increased risk for ustekinumab or methotrexate
treatment (Supplemental Fig 1; available at http://
www.jaad.org), whereas TNF-a inhibitor treatment
for 12 or more months significantly increased the risk
for lung cancer (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.15-10.92;
P = .028); however, these data were difficult to
interpret because of the wide CIs and the low
numbers of events.
Results of sensitivity analyses based on varying
the
definition
of
exposure
before
index
date
(ie,
6 months
or 24
months)
were
generally
consistent
with
those
of
the
primary
analysis
(12 months) (Table II and Fig 2). However, the
most recent therapy analysis (Table III) and the
monotherapy
analysis
(Table
IV)
found
no
significant association between increased risk and
treatment for any of the study therapies. Note that in
the monotherapy analysis, the total number of
cases of malignancy decreased from 252 to 210
(those who had received treatment with more than
1 study agent in the year preceding the index date
were excluded).
DISCUSSION
Findings
from
this
large
psoriasis
registry
indicate no increased risk for overall or frequently
observed
malignancies
with
any
duration
of
treatment for either methotrexate or ustekinumab
when compared with no treatment with these
systemic therapies. Treatment with a TNF-a inhibitor

malignancy risk in the primary analysis. These
results were supported by findings derived from
sensitivity analyses that varied the definition of
exposure (6 and 24 months). However, additional
sensitivity analyses that attributed malignancies to
the most recent systemic psoriasis treatment or
excluded cases with exposure to multiple study
therapies did not corroborate the elevated risk with
a TNF-a inhibitor.

 There is a relative paucity of data regarding
long-term malignancy risk associated with systemic
treatment of psoriasis. Current data regarding the
malignancy
risk
associated
with
methotrexate
derives from small series and case studies,29,30 and
our findings did not indicate an increased risk for
malignancy with methotrexate exposure. In the
long-term extension of the pivotal PHOENIX I and
II trials of ustekinumab, malignancy rates up to
5 years of follow-up remained low and comparable
to the expected rate from the National Cancer
Institute
Surveillance,
Epidemiology,
and
End
Results database.14,15,31 As in all randomized trials,
however, patients had to qualify for the study on the
basis of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria,
and the long-term follow-up included only a limited
number of patients; therefore, outcomes for patients
in clinical trials may not necessarily be representative
of
the
general
population.
Nonetheless,
these
findings from this PSOLAR study, which represents
a real-world population, demonstrate no increased
risk for malignancy with long-term exposure to
ustekinumab, which is consistent with the results
from long-term clinical trials.
The potential malignancy risk associated with
TNF-a inhibitor use for other indications has been
widely studied and debated. An early meta-analysis
of
rheumatoid
arthritis
trials
found
a
3.3-fold
increased risk for malignancy with exposure to
infliximab or adalimumab16; however, this finding
was not replicated in subsequent studies.17-21 In
psoriasis, the long-term extension of pivotal trials
for infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept11-13 have
generally shown low and stable rates of malignancy
that, in some cases, are comparable to the rates from
databases such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results database.
In our primary analysis, an elevated risk for
malignancy was seen with longer-term exposure to
a TNF-a inhibitor (etanercept, adalimumab, and
infliximab). By design, this analysis allowed for
inclusion of cases/controls with possible exposure
to multiple study agents within 12 or more months of
the index date, and logistic regression was used to
adjust for the effect of multiple exposures. Two
sensitivity
analyses
were
conducted
to
further
explore the effect of multiple exposures. The first,
which attributed malignancies to the most recent
exposure, showed a trend toward increased risk with
long-term TNF-a inhibitor exposure; however, the
results were not statistically significant. In the
second, which excluded malignancies with multiple
exposures and reduced the number of cases for
consideration, no elevated risk was observed for any
of the study agents. The reason for these conflicting
results is unclear, although a plausible explanation is
that much of the malignancy risk in the TNF-a
inhibitor exposure group might be attributed to
combination therapy that includes a TNF-a inhibitor.

 cases,
mutually
exclusive
groups,
and
longer
follow-up are needed to clarify malignancy risk
with long-term TNF-a inhibitor exposure.
We chose not to separate individual TNF-a
inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept)
in the primary analysis because of the inadequate
statistical power of this approach. Additionally, there
were a number of cases and controls who switched
from one TNF-a inhibitor to another; this cumulative
exposure is captured only in the pooled analysis.
Nevertheless, the results of the individual TNF-a
inhibitor analysis suggest that the elevated risk seen
in the pooled analysis (OR of 1.54) was driven by
etanercept and adalimumab (ORs of 1.37 for both)
rather than by infliximab (OR of 1.01). Also, judging
by the higher OR in the pooled analysis versus any of
the ORs in the individual analyses, cumulative
exposure to a TNF-a inhibitor might be meaningful
to malignancy risk. Again, studies with greater power
for each individual TNF-a inhibitor are needed to
help clarify the risk.
The current study has several key strengths. The
study
population
derives
from
a
longitudinal,
disease-based registry of patients recruited from
academic, community-based, and hospital-affiliated
settings at which therapy is administered per local
practice. Thus, the results are generalizable to
various
real-world
practice
settings.
The
case-
control design,32 as opposed to a longitudinal cohort
design, allows inclusion of all incident malignancies
(which are a relatively rare event) and maintenance
of power. Also, given that treatment bias may play a
role (ie, those patients who were at higher risk for
malignancy
might
have
preferentially
received
long-term systemic therapy), the analytical model
adjusted for variables such as duration of disease,
psoriasis severity, and past psoriasis therapy. Unlike
in previous studies,4,8,9 treatment history was not
used as a proxy for disease severity because PSOLAR
measures both directly. The analytical model also
controlled for other factors that affect malignancy
risk, including alcohol use, smoking, and family
history of malignancy.
This observational study also has some important
limitations. Exposure is not randomized, and despite
adjustment for important covariates, it was not
possible to control for all treatment bias. In the
primary
analysis,
exposure
to
concurrent
and
sequential therapies (by switching) was allowed,
meaning cases or controls could belong to 1 or more
of the 3 systemic psoriasis therapy categories, and
malignancy risk could not be attributed to a single
therapy. Information regarding several established
malignancy risk factors (eg, occupational exposures,
socioeconomic elements, reproductive factors for
women, and nonpsoriasis concomitant medications)
is not collected systematically in PSOLAR, leading to
potential
residual
confounders.
Data
collection
regarding smoking and alcohol use was limited to
information gathered only at registry entry, which
lacked quantifiable measures. Not all malignancy
cases were confirmed by pathology report or

 medical records from the treating oncologist. Finally,
the numbers of common malignancy types were
small, (n = 14-40), thus limiting the precision of risk
estimates
for
the
most
frequently
occurring
individual malignancy types.
In summary, the results from this large disease-
based registry of patients with psoriasis treated with
systemic therapies provide evidence that neither
methotrexate nor ustekinumab increase the overall
malignancy
risk
(excluding
NMSC),
whereas
longer-term TNF-a inhibitor therapy may increase
such risk. Additional studies with a larger number of
events are needed to further investigate these
associations.

Supplemental Fig 1. Psoriasis. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of
individual malignancies with exposure in the primary analysis for exposure to methotrexate
within 12 months (A), exposure to tumor necrosis factor-a inhibitors (TNF-a) within 12 months
(B), and exposure to ustekinumab within 12 months (C).*The P value comparing lung cancer
cases with matched controls was significant for TNF-a inhibitor treatment (P = .028).
