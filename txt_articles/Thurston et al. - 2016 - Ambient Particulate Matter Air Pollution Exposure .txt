Introduction
Over the past several decades, numerous 
published epidemiologic studies have docu-
mented a consistent association between 
long-term exposure to fine particulate matter 
mass (≤ 2.5 μm; PM2.5) air pollution and an 
increase in the risk of mortality around the 
globe (e.g., Beelen et al. 2014; Brook et al. 
2010; Crouse et al. 2012; Dockery et al.1993; 
Eftim et al. 2008; Ostro et al. 2010; 
Ozkaynak and Thurston 1987; Pope et al. 
1995, 2002, 2004). Pope and collaborators 
notably found elevated relative risks of cardio-
vascular (CVD) mortality in association with 
long-term PM2.5 exposure [hazard ratio (HR) 
per 10 μg/m3 = 1.12; 95% confidence interval 
(CI): 1.08, 1.15] in the largest and most 
definitive U.S. nationwide cohort considered 
to date (Pope et al. 2002, 2004), providing 
a cardio 
vascular mortality HR of 1.12 per 
10 μg/m3 (95% CI: 1.08,1.15). However, 
existing U.S. cohort studies of PM2.5 health 
effects are still being questioned (e.g., Reis 
2013). In addition, particulate matter air 
pollution levels have been declining in recent 
years in the United States, so there is a need to 
confirm whether studies conducted in the past 
at higher levels are replicable today. Thus, it is 
important to test these associations in another 
large U.S. cohort with detailed individual-
level risk factor information on participants, 
especially one for which pollution exposures 
can be estimated at the individual participant 
residence level, and in more recent lower 
PM2.5 exposure years, as we report here. This 
research addresses these needs using the newly 
available U.S. National Institutes of Health–
AARP Diet & Health cohort (NIH-AARP 
Study) (Schatzkin et al. 2001).
Methods
Study population. The NIH-AARP Study 
was initiated when members of the AARP, 
50–71 years of age from six U.S. states 
(California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, 
North Carolina, and Pennsylvania) and two 
metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Georgia, and 
Detroit, Michigan), responded to a mailed 
questionnaire in 1995 and 1996. Details of 
the NIH-AARP Study have been described 
previously (Schatzkin et al. 2001). Among 
566,398 participants enrolled in the 
NIH-AARP cohort and available for analysis 
in 2014, we first excluded for this analysis 
those individuals for whom the forms were 
filled out by a proxy (n = 15,760, or 2.8%); 
who moved out of their study region before 
January 2000 (n = 13,863, or 2.4%); who 
died before 1 January 2000 (n = 21,415, 
or 3.8%); and those for whom census-level 
outdoor PM2.5 exposure was not estimable 
using the methods discussed below (n = 737, 
or 0.1%). After accounting for overlapping 
exclusions, the analytic cohort includes 
517,041 (91.3%) participants for whom 
matching PM2.5 air pollution data were 
available. The NIH-AARP cohort question-
naires elicited information on demographic 
and anthropometric characteristics, dietary 
intake, and numerous health-related variables 
(e.g., marital status, body mass index, educa-
tion, race, smoking status, physical activity, 
and alcohol consumption) at enrollment 
only. Contextual environment characteristics 
(e.g., median income) for the census tract of 
each of this cohort’s participants have also 
been compiled for this population by the 
NIH-AARP Study (NIH-AARP 2006), 
allowing us to also incorporate contextual 
socioeconomic variables at the census-tract 
level. All participants provided informed 
consent before completing the study

Background: Outdoor fine particulate matter (≤ 2.5 μm; PM2.5) has been identified as a global 
health threat, but the number of large U.S. prospective cohort studies with individual participant 
data remains limited, especially at lower recent exposures.
oBjectives: We aimed to test the relationship between long-term exposure PM2.5 and death risk 
from all nonaccidental causes, cardiovascular (CVD), and respiratory diseases in 517,041 men and 
women enrolled in the National Institutes of Health-AARP cohort.
Methods: Individual participant data were linked with residence PM2.5 exposure estimates across 
the continental United States for a 2000–2009 follow-up period when matching census tract–level 
PM2.5 exposure data were available. Participants enrolled ranged from 50 to 71 years of age, 
residing in six U.S. states and two cities. Cox proportional hazard models yielded hazard ratio (HR) 
estimates per 10 μg/m3 of PM2.5 exposure.
results: PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with total mortality (HR = 1.03; 95% CI: 
1.00, 1.05) and CVD mortality (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.15), but the association with 
respiratory mortality was not statistically significant (HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.13). A signifi-
cant association was found with respiratory mortality only among never smokers (HR = 1.27; 
95% CI: 1.03, 1.56). Associations with 10-μg/m3 PM2.5 exposures in yearly participant residential 
annual mean, or in metropolitan area-wide mean, were consistent with baseline exposure model 
results. Associations with PM2.5 were similar when adjusted for ozone exposures. Analyses of 
California residents alone also yielded statistically significant PM2.5 mortality HRs for total and 
CVD mortality.
conclusions: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 air pollution was associated with an increased risk of 
total and CVD mortality, providing an independent test of the PM2.5–mortality relationship in a 
new large U.S. prospective cohort experiencing lower post-2000 PM2.5 exposure levels.

questionnaire. The study was approved by the 
institutional review boards of the National 
Cancer Institute and New York University 
School of Medicine.
Cohort follow-up and mortality ascertain-
ment. Vital status was ascertained through a 
periodic linkage of the cohort to the Social 
Security Administration Death Master File 
and follow-up searches of the National Death 
Index Plus for participants who matched to 
the Social Security Administration Death 
Master File (unpublished data, available on 
request from https://www.ssa.gov/dataex-
change/), cancer registry linkage, questionnaire 
responses, and responses to other mailings. 
Participants were followed for address changes 
using the U.S. Postal Service’s National 
Change of Address database, responses to 
other study-related mailings such as newslet-
ters, and directly from cohort members’ 
notifications (Michaud et al. 2005). We used 
the International Classification of Diseases, 
9th Revision (ICD-9) and the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision to define death due to CVD 
(ICD-10: I00–I99), nonmalignant respira-
tory disease (ICD-10: J00–J99), and deaths 
from nonexternal and nonaccidental deaths 
(ICD-10 A00–R99). During the follow-up 
period considered here (2000 through 2009), 
86,864 (16.8%) participants died, of whom 
84,404 (97.2% of deaths) participants died of 
 
nonexternal and nonaccidental causes.
Air pollution exposure assessment. Outdoor 
annual PM2.5-related exposures at the census-
tract level for residences at NIH-AARP 
cohort entry were estimated using data from 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) nationwide Air Quality System (AQS, 
formerly AIRS) (http://www.epa.gov/airdata/). 
The nationwide AQS Network includes nearly 
3,000 sites, has operated since the 1970s, and 
has included measurement of PM2.5 mass 
since mid-1999. The year 2000 was selected 
as the start of follow-up in this study because 
that is the first full year that outdoor PM2.5 
exposure data were available nationwide. The 
contiguous U.S. map in Figure 1 displays the 
census tracts in which the members of this 
cohort resided at the start of the study. Private 
residence locations were not included in the 
original NIH-AARP Cohort data set in order 
to protect participant privacy. As a result, 
we employed census tract centroid estimates 
of monthly average PM2.5 mass exposures 
available through the year 2008, as obtained 
from a published hybrid land-use regression 
(LUR) geostatistical model (Beckerman et al. 
2013), and as matched with individuals by 
NIH to further protect participant anonymity. 
Exposure was considered only through 2008 
because the time-dependent model matched 
deaths with exposure in each prior year, and 
follow-up ended in 2009 for these analyses. 
These estimates used ambient AQS PM2.5 as 
the dependent variable and traffic and land use 
information as predictors (Beckerman et al. 
2013). Residuals from this model were inter-
polated with a Bayesian maximum entropy 
(BME) model, and the estimates from the 
LUR and BME were combined post hoc to 
derive monthly estimates of PM2.5. To allow 
investigation of possible confounding by O3 
exposure, annual primary metropolitan statis-
tical area (PMSA) mean ozone (O3) exposures 
were also estimated for the year 2000 by 
averaging annual O3 means from all ambient 
monitoring sites with > 75% of possible days 
of data in each PMSA (including 391 sites 
among 93 PMSAs) (U.S. EPA 2014). The 
PMSA mean PM2.5 mass concentrations in 
2008, at the end of the exposure period, were 
lower than but highly correlated with their 
paired PMSA mean concentration in 2000 
(R2 = 0.77), suggesting that the spatial rank 
ordering of PM2.5 concentrations remained 
consistent over the follow-up period. However, 
the number of cohort participants living below 
the U.S. annual PM2.5 standard (12 μg/m3) 
increased over time, rising steadily from 
only 33% of cohort participants in 2000 
(mean ± SD = 13.6 ± 3.6 μg/m3) up to 78% of 
cohort participants living below the 12 μg/m3 
annual PM2.5 standard in 2008 (mean ± SD 
= 10.2 ± 2.3 μg/m3). Therefore, to incorporate 
these exposure level changes over the follow-up 
time, we also developed annual mean expo-
sures at the census tract centroid of each partic-
ipant’s residence at baseline to incorporate into 
a time-dependent sensitivity analysis of the 
PM2.5–mortality association, with censoring 
for those known to have moved.
Statistical methods. Person-years of 
follow-up were included for each participant 
from 1 January 2000 to the date of death, 
the end of follow-up (31 December 2009), 
or the date the participant moved out of 
the state or city where s/he lived at enroll-
ment, whichever occurred first. This period 
was selected because that is the time period 
for which outdoor PM2.5 exposure estimates 
were available nationwide at the census-tract 
level for matching with the cohort mortality 
data (Beckerman et al. 2013). For the time-
independent exposure model, the exposure 
metric was each participants’s annual mean 
enrollment census tract–centroid PM2.5 
exposure in the first year of this mortality 
analysis, 2000, which was the first complete 
year of PM2.5 data availability across the 
United States. In addition, we also considered 
a time-dependent (annual mean) model, for 
which annual mean census tract–level exposure 
to PM2.5 was treated as time-varying, with a 
1-year lag. For example, mortality risk during 
2000 was related to each participant’s enroll-
ment residence census tract–specific average 
PM2.5 for 1999.
We used the Cox proportional hazards 
models (Cox and Oakes 1984; Fleming and 
Harrington 1991) to estimate relative risks 
(RRs) of mortality and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) in relation to ambient PM2.5 (per 
10 μg/m3). In multivariate models including 
individual-level variables, we treated age (in 
3-year groupings), sex and region (six U.S. 
States and two municipalities of residence 
at study entry) as strata and adjusted for the 
following individual covariates and potential 
risk factors at enrollment: race (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, other), educa-
tion (< 8 years, 8–11 years, high school, 
some college, college graduate), marital status 
(married, never married, or other, including 
widowed/divorced/separated and unknown), 
body mass index (BMI; < 18.5, 18.5 to < 25.0, 
25.0 to < 30.0, 30 to < 35, and ≥ 35 kg/m2), 
alcohol consumption (none, < 1, 1–2, 2–5, 
and ≥ 5 drinks per day), and smoking history 
(never smoker, former smoker who quit at least 
1 year ago of ≤ 1 pack/day, former smoker 
who quit at least 1 years ago of > 1 pack/day, 
quit less than 1 year ago or current smoker 
of ≤ 1 pack/day, quit less than 1 year ago or 
current smoker of > 1 pack/day). We also 
included two contextual characteristics of the

participants’ residential census tracts found 
to modify the PM2.5–mortality HR estimates 
and have statistical significance in our analyses 
(data not shown): a) median census tract 
household income; and b) percent of census 
tract population with less than a high school 
education, based on the 2000 decennial census 
for the residence at study entry, as included 
in the cohort data set (NIH-AARP 2006). 
Potential effect modification was assessed by 
including multiplicative interaction terms 
between PM2.5 concentrations and each 
covariate [e.g., sex, age < 65 or ≥ 65 years, age 
and sex combined, education (< high school, 
high school, > high school), and smoking 
(never, former, current) at baseline] in the 
proportional hazards models. Likelihood ratio 
statistic p-values (two-sided) comparing model 
fit with and without interaction terms were 
used to test the statistical significance of each 
interaction, with p-values of < 0.05 defined as 
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were 
carried out in SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute 
Inc.) and R (version 3.0.1), using the “survival” 
package (R Core Team 2013).
Additional sensitivity analyses were 
conducted, including models without adjusting 
for contextual variables; limiting the analysis 
to California residents; without censoring data 
after people moved; adjusting for O3, and 
using PM2.5 exposures estimated at the metro-
politan area average level (rather than at the 
census tract level). In addition, other contextual 
characteristics were also considered: a) Gini 
coefficient, a metric of income inequality; b) 
percent of census tract population who are 
black; c) percent of census tract population 
who are unemployed; and d) percent of census 
tract population living below the poverty level, 
but were not included in the final model, as 
addition of these variables did not significantly 
affect results. To allow more direct compari-
sons with past work applying random effects 
methods (e.g., Krewski et al. 2009), we also 
evaluated HRs in relation to baseline (2000) 
PM2.5 exposure levels while incorporating 
random effects for state of residence using the 
“coxme” package in R.
To show how the shape of the 
PM2.5–mortality relationship response varies 
with concentration in this cohort, PM2.5 
natural spline (ns) plots with 4 degrees of 
freedom (df) were prepared for both total 
(all cause) and cardiovascular mortality using 
standard Cox models for the baseline case, 
stratified by age and sex, and adjusted for all 
individual-level covariates and contextual 
variables, as described above.
Results
The cohort was exposed to a wide range 
of PM2.5 concentrations (Table 1), with a 
concentration range similar to the nation as 
a whole (U.S. EPA 2009). Except for race 
(for which Table 1 indicates a rising exposure 
with increasing percentage of black partici-
pants), cohort characteristics were generally 
similar across PM2.5 exposure level, limiting 
the potential for confounding in our PM2.5 
mortality relationship analyses.
In our time-independent baseline exposure 
Cox model analyses of the selected cohort 
(using the study entry tract of residence 
PM2.5 mean as the exposure reference for 
each participant), higher levels of ambient 
PM2.5 exposure were significantly associated 
with increased mortality due to all causes 
of (nonaccidental) death (HR = 1.03 per 
10 μg/m3 PM2.5; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.05) and 
cardiovascular disease (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 
1.05, 1.15), as presented in Table 2. Stratified 
analyses by sex, age, and education for this 
cohort did not indicate significant differences 
in PM2.5 effect estimates across categories 
(Table 2). However, although PM2.5 exposure 
was not significantly associated overall 
with increased risk of respiratory mortality 
(HR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.13), an associa-
tion was found for never smokers (HR = 1.27; 
95% CI: 1.03, 1.56). Figure 2 graphically 
demonstrates, for the time-independent 
model, the monotonically rising nature of 
the concentration–response curve for both 
all-cause and CVD mortality (vs. a referent 
HR = 1.0 at the mean level of exposure).
A number of sensitivity analyses for alter-
native models were also conducted (Table 3). 
In general, associations were stronger and 
p-values were smaller when we did not 
adjust for census tract–level contextual 
environmental variables, including the asso-
ciation with respiratory mortality (HR = 1.09; 
95% CI: 1.02, 1.18). Adding random-
effects terms to the time-independent model 
yielded very similar results to those without 
random-effects terms. Time-dependent 
yearly exposure models gave comparable 
results to the year 2000 time-independent 
baseline exposure model for total mortality 
(HR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.05), CVD 
mortality (HR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.16), 
and respiratory mortality (HR = 1.05; 
95% CI: 0.97, 1.15). Limiting the analysis 
to only California (the state with the largest 
number of cohort participants) gave similar 
results to the entire cohort. To assess the 
extent to which our censoring of those who 
moved out of the study state/city might 
have affected the results, we also present 
overall results for participants without that 
censoring, retaining those who moved after 
2000, finding that it gave similar results 
to our base model case with censoring (as 
shown in Table 2). In addition, in a model 
that simultaneously also included exposure to 
the gaseous pollutant O3 along with PM2.5, 
the PM2.5 effect estimate was found to be 
still significant and its CVD mortality effect 
estimate not statistically different from the 
model without the addition of O3, indicating 
the PM2.5–CVD mortality association to be 
robust to the addition of O3.
Discussion
In this large prospective cohort study with 
detailed baseline individual-level risk factor 
information on study participants (e.g., 
smoking, BMI, alcohol use), we confirmed 
a monotonically increasing, and statistically 
significant, relationship between long-term 
exposure to PM2.5 air pollution and both 
all-cause and CVD mortality, even at the 
decreased PM2.5 levels experienced in the 
United States since 2000. Comparisons by 
sex, age, and education for this cohort did 
not indicate statistically significant differ-
ences in the mortality–PM2.5 association 
across categories.
With significant overall associations 
with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, 
the results presented here are consistent with 
many, but not all, of the prior published 
results examining PM2.5 and mortality. We 
estimated a 3% increase (95% CI: 0, 5%) 
in all-cause mortality for a 10-μg/m3 annual 
increase in PM2.5 that, though statistically 
significant in this large cohort, is lower than 
many other past estimates. For example, 
a recent literature review reported a pooled 
effect estimate of 6% per 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 
(95% CI: 4, 8%) for all-cause mortality (Hoek 
et al. 2013). Our overall estimate for CVD 
mortality (10% effect per 10 μg/m3; 95% CI: 
5, 15%), agrees more closely with the 
pooled estimate for CVD mortality reported 
by Hoek et al. (2013) (11% per 10 μg/m3; 
95% CI: 6, 16%).
Comparisons with the American Cancer 
Society (ACS) cohort, a similarly large nation-
wide cohort, provides an opportunity to 
evaluate the issue of association consistency 
over time in the United States. Although 
participants in the ACS cohort (Pope et al. 
2002) were somewhat younger (mean 
56 years at recruitment, vs. mean 65 years 
in the NIH-AARP cohort in 2000), and 
were exposed during that study’s follow-
up to pollution at an earlier period of time 
(when the mix of air pollution sources was 
likely different), it has a similar racial (> 90% 
white) and educational (> 50% post–high 
school education) composition, is of similar 
size (> 500,000 participants), and also spans 
the United States, making it probably the 
most similar U.S. cohort for comparison here. 
The ACS cohort reported that a 10-μg/m3 
increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 4% 
increase in all-cause mortality (95% CI: 
1, 8%) (Pope et al. 2002), which is consis-
tent with the corresponding estimate from the 
present analysis (3% per 10 μg/m3; 95% CI: 
0, 5%), as shown in Figure 3. Moreover, 
 PM2.5 air pollution and mortality in a U.S. cohort

the PM2.5–CVD mortality effect estimate 
reported for the ACS cohort (12% per 
10 μg/m3; 95% CI: 8, 15%) (Pope et al. 
2004) is very similar to the corresponding 
association in the NIH-AARP cohort (10% 
per 10 μg/m3; 95% CI: 5, 15%) (Figure 3). 
This new prospective cohort study’s follow-up 
begins at approximately the time that most 
of the published ACS cohort’s follow-up 
analyses ended, providing an independent test 
as to whether the effects continue to the lower 
PM2.5 levels in the 21st century. The ACS 
cohort study started in 1982 with follow-up 
through 1998, with an annual PM2.5 study 
period mean ± SD = 17.7 ± 3.7 μg/m3 
(Pope et al. 2002); in contrast, this new 
NIH-AARP analysis started in 2000 with 
much lower study follow-up mean PM2.5 of 
12.2 ± 3.4 μg/m3 through 2008. Our study 
therefore documents for the first time that 
the PM2.5–mortality effects still occur at the 
much lower post-2000 levels of exposures 
across the United States. In California, the 
ACS follow-up ended with a mean 1998–
2002 PM2.5 concentration of 14.1 μg/m3 
(Jerrett et al. 2013), versus a much lower 
end of follow-up mean 2008 PM2.5 concen-
tration of 10.4 μg/m3 in the present study. 
Figure 3 provides comparative plots of these 
two cohort’s PM2.5 mortality estimates across 
mortality outcomes, for both the United 
States and the State of California (Jerrett 
et al. 2013; Krewski et al. 2009; Pope et al. 
2002, 2004), indicating consistency in their 
effect estimates, despite the notable decline in 
pollution levels after 2000.
We have also considered and compared 
effect estimates per 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 as a 
function of alternative PM2.5 exposure 
metrics. In addition to the year 2000 base 
PM2.5 exposure index, we also considered 
time-dependent annual mean exposure 
models for each mortality outcome that 
directly addressed the declining concentration 
levels of PM2.5 exposures during follow-up.

The fixed exposure model has the advantage 
that it provides results using methods directly 
comparable to those used in many past such 
analyses (e.g., the ACS CP-II cohort). We 
found that the annual mean model yielded 
results consistent with the baseline (year 
2000) exposure time-independent model. 
Lepeule et al. (2012) also found that varying 
the exposure metric choice had little effect 
on PM2.5 effect estimates in their analysis of 
the Harvard Six Cities Study cohort. Not

of the study areas between 2000 and 2006 
(n = 28,923) had little effect on these results. 
We also compared the results using both 
PMSA and census tract–level mean exposure 
metrics, finding similar and confirmatory 
results with either approach. This may suggest 
that the fact that people are mobile, and often 
do not stay at their home residence all day, 
may limit the exposure assessment accuracy 
gain derived from knowing home residence 
locale versus an area-wide average. Overall, 
we found that the PM2.5–mortality associa-
tions in this work are robust to various PM2.5 
exposure modeling choices.
Numerous past long-term PM2.5–mortality 
analyses have found higher relative risks 
among those with less education. For example, 
Krewski et al. (2000), in their reanalysis of 
the Six Cities and ACS cohorts, found that 
the relative risk of mortality associated with 
fine particles was greater among individuals 
with high school education or less, compared 
to those with more than high school educa-
tion in the Six Cities Study, and that the fine 
particle air pollution mortality risk decreased 
significantly (p < 0.05) with increasing educa-
tional attainment in the ACS cohort. They 
concluded that “it is possible that educational 
attainment is a marker for socioeconomic 
status, which in turn may be correlated 
with exposure to fine particle air pollution.” 
Similarly, Brunekreef et al. (2009) found in 
their NLCS (Netherlands Cohort Study on 
Diet and Cancer)–AIR cohort examination 
of long-term exposure to traffic air pollution 
that associations with mortality tended to 
be stronger in case–cohort participants with 
lower levels of education, but that differences 
between strata were not statistically significant. 
Ostro et al. (2008) also estimated stronger 
associations with components of PM2.5 among 
individuals with lower educational attainment, 
attributing this trend to the effects of lower 
socioeconomic status. However, no such trend 
was found in this NIH-AARP cohort, perhaps 
because the reported annual incomes of this 
cohort did not vary with PM2.5 concentration 
(Table 1). Indeed, although the association of 
education with median income in this cohort 
was strong (r = 0.49), the correlation between 
PM2.5 and median income was much lower 
(p = 0.03). Thus, it may be that the lack of a 
strong  
socioeconomic– 
PM2.5 covariation in 
this cohort is the reason we did not see the 
mortality effect modification by education 
status found in past studies.
This study has both strengths and limi-
tations relative to past such studies. One 
strength is that we have employed estimates 
of PM2.5 exposure at the participant residence 
census tract level, rather than applying the 
overall county or metropolitan area average 
exposure that has been used in some major 
prior studies (e.g., the Medicare and ACS 
cohorts, respectively) (Eftim et al. 2008; 
Krewski et al. 2009). In addition, most 
previous studies have assigned only a single 
fixed exposure level for each study participant 
(e.g., at the start of the follow-up), whereas we 
also considered a sensitivity model applying 
time-varying exposure estimates to address 
the declining PM2.5 exposure levels over time. 
Another strength of this study is that covariate 
risk factors were collected at the individual 
level, but a limitation is that this was ascer-
tained only at enrollment, and we could not 
account for temporal changes in risk factors 
(e.g., smoking and BMI) during follow up. 
Another limitation is that, other than knowing 
if and when participants leave the NIH-AARP 
cohort study areas, we presently lack infor-
mation on residence location after those 
participants moved out of the study region. 
Despite these limitations, as discussed above, 
our derived effect estimates were found to be 
largely consistent with other PM2.5 mortality 
results, notably the ACS cohort study (Pope 
et al. 2002, 2004), the only prior prospective 
U.S. cohort study of such size with detailed 
individual-level risk factor information.
Conclusions
Long-term exposure to PM2.5 air pollution 
was associated with a significant increase in 
CVD and total nonaccidental mortality in the 
cohort as a whole, as well as with a significant 
increase in respiratory mortality among never 
smokers, in a new, large, U.S. cohort having 
detailed individual level participant data and 
census tract–level PM2.5 exposure informa-
tion. This independent evaluation of the 
PM2.5–mortality association, in this new large 
cohort, was robust to various model specifica-
tion and PM2.5 exposure assessment sensitivity 
analyses, and has found effect estimates (per 
10 μg/m3 of PM2.5 exposure) that are consis-
tent with past estimates, even at the much 
lower PM2.5 air pollution levels experienced in 
the United States since 2000.
