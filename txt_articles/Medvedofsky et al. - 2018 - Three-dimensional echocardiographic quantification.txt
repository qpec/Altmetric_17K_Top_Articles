Aims
Although recommended by current guidelines, adoption of three-dimensional echocardiographic (3DE) chamber
quantification in clinical practice has lagged because of time-consuming analysis. We recently validated an auto-
mated algorithm that measures left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF). This
study aimed to determine the accuracy and reproducibility of these measurements in a multicentre setting.

Methods
and results
180 patients underwent 3DE imaging (Philips) at six sites. Images were analysed using automated HeartModel (HM)
software with endocardial border correction when necessary and by manual tracing. Measurements were per-
formed by each site and by the Core Laboratory (CL) as the reference. Inter-technique comparisons included HM
measurements by the sites against manual tracing by CL, and showed strong correlations (r-values: LVEDV: 0.97,
LVESV: 0.97, LVEF: 0.88, LAV: 0.96), with the automated technique slightly underestimating LV volumes (biases:
LVEDV: -14 ± 20 ml, LVESV: -6 ± 20 ml), LVEF (-2 ± 7%) and LAV (-9 ± 10 ml). Intra-technique comparisons included
HM measurements by the sites against CL, with and without corrections. Corrections were unnecessary or minimal
in most patients, and improved the measurements only modestly. Comparisons without corrections showed per-
fect agreement for all parameters. With corrections, correlations were better (r-values: LVEDV: 0.99, LVESV: 0.99,
LVEF: 0.94, LAV: 0.99) and biases (LVEDV: -8 ± 12 ml, LVESV: -6 ± 12 ml, LVEF: 1 ± 5%, LAV: -10 ± 6 ml) smaller
than in inter-technique comparison. All automated measurements with corrections were more reproducible than
manual measurements.

Conclusion
Automated 3DE analysis of left-heart chambers is an accurate alternative to conventional manual methodology,
which yields almost the same values across laboratories and is more reproducible. This technique may contribute
towards full integration of 3DE quantification into clinical routine.

Introduction
Over the past decade, real-time three-dimensional (3D) imaging has
become an integral part of the echocardiography landscape because of
its proven advantages over two-dimensional (2D) imaging in multiple
areas. With the wide availability of 3D echocardiography (3DE) equip-
ment and analysis software and the rapidly growing body of knowledge,
this novel methodology is earning its place as the new standard in
many areas. One area where its advantages over 2D echocardiography
(2DE) are particularly well established is the quantification of cardiac
chambers’ size and function, with benefits of increased accuracy and
improved clinical prognostic significance. This is because the 3DE ap-
proach does not rely on geometric assumptions and thus avoids the
risk of underestimating chamber volumes because of the use of fore-
shortened views,1–3 which are common with 2DE. Because the use of
the additional dimension translates into improved accuracy and repro-
ducibility, recently published guidelines recommend the use of 3DE
quantification of left-heart chambers when possible.4 However, the
current software implementation of this approach relies on extensive
user input, making it time consuming, which adversely affects the work-
flow of a busy clinical laboratory. As a result, this methodology has not
been widely embraced nor fully integrated into the routine clinical
work in most centres,1,5,6 which continue to rely on traditional, fre-
quently qualitative 2DE assessment of cardiac function.
To bridge this gap between available technology and routine clin-
ical work, we recently tested the feasibility of a new automated ap-
proach for left-heart chamber quantification based on an adaptive
analytics algorithm, which was trained on a large number of 3DE
datasets obtained in patients with a variety of normal and abnormal
hearts, including common asymmetric left ventricular (LV) shapes,
but excluding aneurysms (Figure 1). In a single-centre study, we
showed good accuracy and reproducibility, and improved speed of
analysis, compared with the conventional 3DE methodology.7 As the
development of the algorithm continued, multiple refinements were
made, resulting in improved endocardial boundary detection that re-
quires minimal to no manual corrections, as well as improved ability
to analyse a larger percentage of the patient population. We
hypothesized that in its current form, the automated 3DE analysis
that simultaneously quantifies LV and left atrial (LA) volumes and LV
ejection fraction (EF) would universally provide accurate and repro-
ducible measurements, and would therefore be suitable for wide-
spread clinical use. To test this hypothesis, we designed a prospective
validation study with a standardized protocol in a multicentre setting.
The validation included comparisons of the automated measure-
ments made by the participating sites with and without corrections
against two sets of reference values, both generated by trained per-
sonnel at a highly experienced Core Laboratory (CL): (i) conven-
tional 3DE chamber quantification methodology (inter-technique
comparisons), and (ii) the new automated measurements (intra-tech-
nique comparisons).
Methods
Population and study design
We studied patients referred for clinically indicated echocardiograms for
a wide range of suspected cardiovascular conditions, who underwent
transthoracic 2DE and 3DE imaging at six institutions. Participating sites
underwent brief training by the developers of the new software in both
3DE image acquisition and analysis. The protocol was approved by the in-
stitutional review board of each participating institution. Written in-
formed consent was obtained from each patient.
Each institution enrolled 30 patients into four groups defined accord-
ing to the biplane 2DE LVEF (group 1 <
_20%, group 2 = 21–40%, group
3 = 41–55%, group 4 >55%), to ensure a wide range of chamber size and
function. Exclusion criteria were: complex congenital heart disease, his-
tory of mechanical valve replacement, pacemaker or defibrillator leads,
arrhythmia during acquisition, moderate or severe right ventricular en-
largement, LV aneurysm, and poor quality images, defined as poor endo-
cardial visualization on 2DE or 3DE in >2 contiguous segments using a
17-segment model. Patients with common asymmetric ventricular shapes
were not excluded from the study. All images were submitted to the CL
at the University of Chicago for quality approval. Studies with incomplete
acquisitions, corrupt files, missing images, or studies not fully compliant
with the inclusion criteria were rejected, and the site was asked to enrol
another patient into the same slot.
3DE images of patients approved by the CL (N = 180, age
57± 18years,
66%
men
and
34%
women,

surface
area
1.80± 0.29m2, see Table 1 for clinical characteristics) were analysed by
both the enrolling site and the CL to measure LV volumes and EF and LA
volume (LAV) using two 3DE techniques: the conventional manual ana-
lysis and the new automated analysis. These measurements were used
for the aforementioned inter- and intra-technique comparisons. In add-
ition, to determine the effects of the choice of a cardiac cycle for analysis,
we analysed two different cardiac cycles in a randomly selected subgroup
of 60 patients using the fully automated approach without any manual
corrections. Finally, reproducibility of both the new technique and the
conventional methodology in our study population was assessed using
blinded repeated measurements.
Echocardiographic imaging
Imaging was performed using the EPIQ system (version 1.3 or greater,
Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA) and an X5-1 phased-array
transducer with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Before
each acquisition, images were optimized for endocardial visualization by
modifying the gain, compress, and time gain-compensation controls.
Image acquisition included: (i) 2DE images in the apical 2- and 4-chamber
views containing six cardiac cycles in each view, and (ii) a wide-angled
‘full-volume’ 3DE datasets of one cardiac cycle each from the apical pos-
ition during a single breath-hold (HM ACQ key on EPIQ 7C). Care was
taken to include the entire LV and LA cavity within the 2DE and 3DE
images. Images were optimized to obtain the highest possible frame rate.
2DE image analysis
2DE images collected at all sites were initially analysed by each site using
standard methodology. In each view (apical 2- and 4-chamber), the LV
end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) frames were chosen with the
corresponding largest (the first frame after mitral valve closure) and
smallest (the frame after aortic valve closure) LV cavity, respectively. In
these frames, LV boundaries were manually traced in both views to ob-
tain ED and ES volumes (EDV, ESV) and EF was calculated using the bi-
plane method of disks. These EF values were used to enrol patients into
particular slots in the four groups described above.
3DE image analysis
All 3DE images were reviewed by the enrolling site to select the
best dataset, which was analysed by both the site and the CL.

investigators and included: LV EDV, ESV, EF, and LAV at end-ventricular
systole by two 3DE techniques: the new automated analysis (Philips,
HeartModel (HM)) and the conventional manual analysis (Philips, 3DQ).
In each case, the reader was blinded to the results of all previous analyses.
A: Automated 3DE LV and LAV measurements
The automated 3DE software was described in our recent publication.7
Briefly, the software simultaneously detects LV and LA endocardial sur-
faces using an adaptive analytics algorithm, which uses knowledge-based
identification to orient and locate chambers and patient specific adapta-
tion of endocardial borders. The algorithm automatically identifies the
ED and ES phases of the cardiac cycle, and creates ED and ES 3D casts of
the LV cavity and an ES cast of the LA cavity, from which LV and LAVs are
derived directly without geometric assumptions. Because of the fully
automated nature of the algorithm, it has a deterministic convergence re-
sponse, thus yielding the exact same result when repeating the analysis
on the same dataset. However, manual corrections of the resultant LV
and LA endocardial surfaces are possible, when the operator judges the
automatically detected surface as inadequate. This is achieved by display-
ing the LA and LV contours on ED and ES 4-, 3- and 2-chamber cut-
planes extracted from the 3DE datasets using the same default setting for
all patients (74 for ED and 68 for ES), optimized in the training set by max-
imizing the agreement between automated and manual measurements
performed by three readers.7 The user has the option to edit the con-
tours in order to optimize the match between the detected and the per-
ceived endocardial boundary in the corresponding focused views
(Figure 2). The LV casts can be edited by either changing the entire border
globally (dilating or contracting the entire surface uniformly by the same
distance) or by editing it regionally. In contrast, the LA cast can be edited
only regionally. The readers were instructed to include endocardial tra-
beculae in the LV volume.
B: Manual 3DE LV and LA measurements
Manual 3DE measurements of LV EDV, ESV, and LAV were performed
using commercial software (3DQ, QLAB, Philips). The ED and ES frames
used for analysis were the same ones chosen by the automated
Figure 1 Different left ventricular shapes that the automated software was trained to recognize. In addition to normal ventricles, the training set
included a number of common abnormal/asymmetrical ventricular shapes. (Note that the program displays RV and RA casts but no volume values
are provided because they have not been validated).

technique. Users were asked whether they agreed or not with the choice
made by the automated software, based on their visual identification of
valve closures/openings, and their responses were recorded. The follow-
ing steps were performed on the ED and ES frames. First, the user
selected from the 3DE dataset the anatomically correct, non-
foreshortened apical 2- and 4-chamber views focused on the relevant
chamber (LV or LA), in which the long-axis dimension of the respective
chamber was maximized. Then, four mitral annular points were marked
in each of the views, and an additional point was placed to mark either
the LV apex for LV analysis, or the most distal point on the LA roof for
the LA analysis. The endocardial border was automatically generated and
then manually edited to optimize its position. Finally, LV EDV, ESV, and
LAV were obtained and LVEF calculated.
Reproducibility assessment
The reproducibility of the LV and LAV measurements using the two 3DE
techniques (manual and automated) was tested in a randomly selected
subgroup of 90 patients. One week after the initial analysis, the same
loops of the original 3DE datasets were re-analysed using both programs,
at the enrolling site by the same investigator who was blinded to all prior
measurements. These repeated measurements were used to determine
the intra-observer variability. Inter-observer variability was assessed by
comparing measurements performed by the enrolling sites and the CL on
the same 90 patients.
In addition, test–retest variability of the automated technique was as-
sessed in a subgroup of 72 patients (randomly chosen three patients from
each LVEF subgroup at each site, total of 12 patients per site). After the
initial 3DE dataset was obtained, the sonographer removed the probe
from the patient’s chest, and 5 min later repositioned the transducer to
obtain a second dataset.
Inter-measurement variability (inter-observer, intra-observer and
test–retest) of each parameter was expressed as an absolute difference
between the corresponding pair of repeated measurements in percent of
their mean in each patient and then averaged over the relevant subgroup.
Comparison with conventional four-beat
full-volume images
In order to determine how the automated analysis of the HM ACQ
single-beat acquisitions compares with conventional manual analysis of
four-beat acquisitions, we analysed 30 patients enrolled by one of the
sites that had both types of images acquired. The four-beat acquisitions
were analysed using the conventional methodology (3DQ software,
QLAB, Philips), and the results were compared with the automated
measurements.
Statistics
For each parameter, the aforementioned intra- and inter-technique com-
parisons included linear regression with Pearson correlation coefficients
and Bland–Altman analyses to assess the bias and limits of agreement
(defined as 2 SD around the mean). In addition, biases were expressed in
percent of the mean measured value of each parameter, to put the biases
in perspective of the absolute value of the relevant parameter. Paired
t-tests were used to verify the significance of the biases. Values of P < 0.05
were considered significant.
Figure 2 Automated technique for left-heart 3D chamber quantification. Following initial fully-automated detection of left ventricular and left atrial
endocardial surfaces (left), the software allows the user to perform manual corrections of the endocardial boundaries when needed (centre), result-
ing in final 3D casts of the cardiac chambers. The optional correction are performed in anatomically correct non-foreshortened 2D planes showing
focused long-axis views of the left ventricle (top) and left atrium (bottom), both automatically extracted from the 3D dataset.

Results
Average frame rate for the 3D volume sets was 17± 4 Hz. Manual
3DE derived maximal LVEDV ranged between 53 and 524 ml (me-
dian 190ml), LVESV ranged between 17 and 453 ml (median 110 ml),
LVEF ranged between 10% and 72% (median 39%), LAV ranged be-
tween 23 and 170 ml (median 80 ml). Despite the initial exclusion of
patients with inadequate image quality, of the images submitted by
the sites to the CL, 10% were rejected, and their slots were repopu-
lated with new patients.
Inter-technique comparisons against
conventional Core Lab measurements
Automated choices of frames for analysis were in agreement with vis-
ual assessment of the phases of the cardiac cycle in 71% of the cases
for ED and 64% for ES. In the remaining patients, the difference in the
number of frames was one. Inter-technique comparisons showed ex-
cellent agreement between the automated 3DE volume measure-
ments performed by the sites without boundary corrections and the
CL manual 3DE measurements, with measured values being similar
between the two techniques (Table 2, rows 1 and 2). The correl-
ations for the volumes were excellent (r = 0.97, 0.97, and 0.96 for
LVEDV, LVESV, and LAV, respectively), while that for LV EF was
lower (r = 0.88) (Figures 3–6A, top). Volumes were underestimated
with small biases (-14 ± 20 ml for LVEDV, -6± 20ml for LVESV, and -
9 ± 10 ml for LAV), and the bias in LVEF was also minimal (-2 ± 7%)
(Figures 3–6A, bottom).
Manual contour corrections of the automatically detected bounda-
ries resulted in minimal changes in the measurements as a percent of
the mean measured value (Table 2, row 4) and in the correlations:
r = 0.97, 0.98, 0.90, 0.96 for LVEDV, LVESV, LVEF, and LAV, respect-
ively (Figures 3–6B, top). The biases became smaller, with the excep-
tion of LAV, and a minimal decrease was noted in the limits of
agreement (Figures 3–6B, bottom). When expressed as percent of
the mean measured value, the biases were 3–7% for the LV volumes
and only 2% for LV EF, and were not significant for LV parameters;
however, LAV was significantly underestimated by 11% (Table 2,
rows 3). These biases were not clearly affected by contour correc-
tions (Table 2, rows 5).
One observation from the Bland–Altman plots was that the limits
of agreement in LV and LAV measurements were wider in patients
with larger volumes, as reflected by the bigger spread of the data
points in the higher end of the scale (Figures 3, 4 and 6A and B, bot-
tom). In contrast, the limits of agreement in LV EF were independent
of EF magnitude (Figure 5A and B, bottom).
Intra-technique comparisons against
automated Core Lab measurements
Intra-technique comparisons showed perfect agreement between all
automated measurements made by the sites against those made by
the CL, when no contour corrections were made by either the sites
or the CL. This perfect agreement was reflected by volumes and EF
that were identical (Table 3, rows 1 and 2), correlations that were all
r = 1.0 and biases all zero (Figures 3–6C).
With contour corrections made by both the sites and the CL,
intra-technique comparisons showed excellent agreement with
volumes and EF values being similar (Table 3, rows 4 and 5) and the
correlations being: r = 0.99, 0.99, 0.94, 0.99 for LVEDV, LVESV, LVEF,
and LAV, respectively (Figures 3–6D, top). These correlations were
all higher than in the inter-technique comparisons with contour cor-
rections (Figures 3–6B, top). In contrast, biases were similar to those
noted in the inter-technique comparisons with contour corrections,
but importantly the limits of agreement were considerably narrower
(Figures 3–6D, bottom compared with B, bottom). The biases were
5–6% of the measured values for the LV volumes and only 3% for LV
EF, and 12% for LAV, which remained the only significant bias (Table
3, rows 6).
Effects of contour corrections on volume
measurements
Overall, readers determined that no contour corrections were
needed in 35 (19%) patients for EDV, in 40 (22%) patients for ESV,
and in 72 (40%) patients for LAV, while some contour correction
was performed in the remaining patients. Of note, in the majority of
the patients only global contour corrections were performed for LV
volumes: 98 patients for EDV (54%) and 90 patients for ESV (50%),
while no global editing is available for LAV. Importantly, the rela-
tive changes in volumes caused by contour corrections were <
_4%
(Table 4).
Effects of heartbeat selection on the
automated measurements
The results of the comparisons between two cardiac cycles meas-
ured using the fully automated approach are shown in Figure 7.
The correlation between the two measurements for LV EDV, and
ESV was r = 1.00, while those for LV EF, and LAV were slightly
lower (upper panels). The biases between these measurements
have not exceeded a single measurement unit (1 ml for volumes
or 1% for EF), and the limits of agreement were reasonably nar-
row relative to the mean measured value of each parameter. As
expected, these comparisons showed lower levels of agreement
than the intra-technique comparisons of the fully-automated
measurements performed on the same beat (Figures 3–6C), but
better agreement than those performed using manual corrections
(Figures 3–6D).
Effects of acquisition modes
The results of the comparisons between the automated analysis of
the HM ACQ single-beat acquisitions and conventional manual ana-
lysis of four-beat acquisitions in a subgroup of 30 patients are shown
in Figure 8. We found very good agreement between the two tech-
niques, which was similar to that between measurements performed
using the automated analysis on two different cardiac cycles acquired
in the HM ACQ mode (Figure 7).
Reproducibility
Reproducibility results are presented in Table 5. Not surprisingly, for
all four parameters measured by both techniques, the inter-observer
variability was higher than the intra-observer variability. Importantly,
both the inter- and intra-observer variability levels were lower for
the automated measurements than for conventional manual tech-
nique for all four parameters. Variability in LV volume measurements

was always <10%, while that in LAV and EF reached slightly higher
levels.
Figure 9 shows the intra- and inter-observer variability analyses of
the automated measurements with a break-up by level of contour
corrections. For LV EDV, ESV, and EF, most variability was caused by
global editing, while the addition of regional editing resulted in only
minimal increase in variability. No clear differences were found in the
reproducibility of the automated analysis between subgroups of pa-
tients with low and normal EF.
The test–retest variability of the automated program was similar
to that when the automated measurements were performed twice
on the same datasets: for LV EDV, ESV, EF, and LAV it was 4 ± 4%,
4 ± 4%, 9 ± 11%, and 7 ± 7%, respectively, without contour correc-
tions, and, 6 ± 5%, 10 ± 9%, 14± 9%, and 9 ± 8% with contour correc-
tion (compare with data in Table 5).
Differences between sites
No clear differences were noted in the agreement between the
measurements performed by the six participating sites and the CL
reference values in either the inter- or intra-technique compari-
sons. Of note, reproducibility of the automated technique was
better than that of the conventional manual analysis for each indi-
vidual site.
Discussion
Left-heart chamber quantification is critical for both clinical manage-
ment and clinical trials. The recent guidelines emphasize that 3DE
measurements should be preferred over 2DE. However, 3DE has
not been widely incorporated into the routine practice because of
the workflow constraints, including the fact that it is currently time
consuming and requires special expertise. The new automated tech-
nique evaluated in this international multicentre study is able to over-
come the current workflow limitations associated with conventional
3DE chamber quantification, resulting in significant time savings, as
shown in our previous study.7 Because of its simplicity, minimal train-
ing is needed, in contrast to the conventional manual 3DE
methodology.8,9
Although most previously published reports have endorsed earlier
automated techniques for 3DE evaluation of LV volumes for clinical
use, their conclusions were based on single centre studies, in which
data were acquired and measured by highly trained personnel.10–13
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multicentre study to
test the new automated 3DE approach for simultaneous LV and
LAVs, and LV function assessment based on an adaptive analytics al-
gorithm. This study shows that experienced readers in different parts
of the world can obtain accurate and reproducible automated meas-
urements of LVEDV, LVESV, and LVEF with clinically non-significant

differences, contrary to previous studies that tested other automated
algorithms.14–16 Moreover, in the current study, the new software
was more accurate than its previous version tested in our recent
study,7 as reflected by smaller biases and tighter limits of agreement
with the conventional manual tracing based reference values.
This new automated software has the option to perform rapid glo-
bal and/or regional corrections, as needed. Such border correction
was deemed necessary in the majority of patients in this study.
Importantly, however, the fully automated analysis was accurate and
with endocardial border editing, the accuracy improved only slightly
on the average. Nevertheless, one should not disregard the import-
ance of boundary corrections in individual patients, when judged ne-
cessary, especially in patients with enlarged chambers. Moreover,
with border corrections, the reproducibility was better than that of
the conventional manual measurements.
On top of these advantages in terms of LV quantification, the new
automated 3DE algorithm also simultaneously measures LAV
without additional time or effort involved. Also, unlike 2DE, where
dedicated LA focused views are needed to perform accurate bi-plane
measurements, with 3DE, the LA is included in the pyramidal dataset
and no additional image acquisition is needed either. Similar to LV
endocardial contour editing, the new software allows correction of
the LA borders, albeit on a regional basis only. These corrections are
also performed on three anatomically correct non-foreshortened
LA-focused views, which are also automatically extracted from the
3DE dataset, and displayed similar to that used for LV border editing
(Figure 2, bottom). With this approach, automated reasonably accur-
ate and reproducible LAV measurements were obtained in this multi-
centre study.
Furthermore, in contrast to the conventional manual 3DE analysis,
in the automated software, the endocardial borders of both the LV
and LA can be easily followed through the entire chamber both in ED
and ES by changing the view angle. This feature may prove especially
useful in patients with LV aneurysms, who were not included in this

study, because in these patients, border corrections are truly needed
and would have bigger effects on volume measurements.
The inter- and intra-technique comparisons between the auto-
mated analyses by the sites against the different reference standards
generated by the CL showed that the new methodology can be used
universally and provide similar results. An unexpected finding of these
analyses is that contour editing, although judged as necessary by the
readers in the majority of patients, had only limited effects on the
measurements on the average in the entire cohort. One might sug-
gest that these differences would not be clinically significant, because
the largest bias we found in LV EF was 3% of the measured value,
which, with a median EF value of 39% in our patients, translates to an
actual difference of only 1.2% (in actual EF units), which is below the
accuracy of any cardiac imaging technique that measures EF.
However, boundary corrections are likely to be important in individ-
ual patients, where they can result in considerably larger volume and
EF differences that may have important clinical implications.
Another interesting finding was that the automated technique with
corrections was more reproducible than the conventional manual
technique for all four parameters, in terms of both inter- and intra-
observer variability. This may be related to the fact that the auto-
mated software starts from endocardial border position that is based
on algorithm settings that were optimized on images obtained in
thousands of patients. In contrast, the manual analysis starts with no
pre-determined endocardial border, and the user determines the
border position according to their personal preferences. This is likely
to cause inter-measurement variability that may be larger than when
the same reader has to decide how much a reasonable default pos-
ition needs to be adjusted.
Another potential source of variability of the conventional
technique is the need to visually identify the non-foreshortened
apical views. In addition, the automated software identifies the
ED and ES frames which are analysed, unlike the manual analysis,
wherein the user needs to select the correct frames, which
would in itself result in inter-measurement variability. In this
study, the readers were instructed to use for their manual ana-
lyses the same frames chosen by the automated software, in
order to eliminate this source of variability. Also, both inter- and

intra-technique comparisons were performed using the same
heartbeat. Our analysis of the different beats showed the level of
variability this source may account for. Therefore, our study
underestimated the true real-world variability of the conven-
tional manual methodology, which further underscores the value
of the new automated approach. This is because by reducing
measurement variability, this new software may allow true
changes in LV and LAVs or LV function to be detected with more
confidence. In addition, comparisons between imaging modes
(HM ACQ vs. conventional four-beat) showed differences of the
same order of magnitude as those resulting from using the algo-
rithm on different cardiac cycles.
Study limitations
First, one of the inclusion criteria was the need for sufficiently good
image quality to allow automated measurements. Therefore, our
results cannot be extrapolated to consecutive patients, and future
studies are needed to determine the feasibility of this automated ap-
proach in the general patient population. However, no technique, ei-
ther automated or manual can be expected to accurately measure
cardiac chambers on images of substandard quality. On the basis of
our experience with the new software, we estimate that it is likely to
provide accurate and reproducible measurements in �2/3 of con-
secutive patients.
Secondly, all six participating sites were selected for the study
based on their expertise with 3DE imaging and analysis, which again
limits the generalizability of our results that involve user input.
However, one of our main findings is that the need for user input in
the automated analysis is questionable.
Low frame rates are a known limitation of 3DE imaging, especially
of the single-beat acquisition, because low frame-rate datasets may
miss the true end of systole. However, in this study, both inter- and

lated with no contour corrections, with global correction only (for EDV, ESV and EF) and with additional regional adjustments (for all four param-
eters), as deemed necessary by the readers.

intra-technique comparisons were always performed on the same
ED and ES frames. As a result, the low frame rates could not have af-
fected our findings.
Finally, this study only analysed patients in sinus rhythm, without
pacemaker or ICD leads, dilated RV or severely abnormal LV shapes.
Thus these results cannot be extrapolated to patients with atrial fib-
rillation or ectopic rhythm, or patients with exclusion criteria for this
study. The applicability and accuracy in these populations remains to
be determined in future studies.
It is worthwhile noting that the automated algorithm is currently
available from a single vendor. Therefore, it cannot be applied retro-
spectively to images obtained using other formats.
Conclusions
In summary, automated volumetric analysis of left-heart chambers is
an accurate and robust alternative to conventional manual method-
ology, which yields almost the same values across laboratories and is
more reproducible. This technique may contribute towards full inte-
gration of 3DE quantification into clinical routine, when such algo-
rithms become universally available.
