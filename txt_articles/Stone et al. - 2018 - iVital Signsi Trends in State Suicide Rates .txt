Abstract
Introduction: Suicide rates in the United States have risen nearly 30% since 1999, and mental health conditions are 
one of several factors contributing to suicide. Examining state-level trends in suicide and the multiple circumstances 
contributing to it can inform comprehensive state suicide prevention planning.
Methods: Trends in age-adjusted suicide rates among persons aged ≥10 years, by state and sex, across six consecutive 3-year 
periods (1999–2016), were assessed using data from the National Vital Statistics System for 50 states and the District of 
Columbia. Data from the National Violent Death Reporting System, covering 27 states in 2015, were used to examine 
contributing circumstances among decedents with and without known mental health conditions.
Results: During 1999–2016, suicide rates increased significantly in 44 states, with 25 states experiencing increases >30%. Rates 
increased significantly among males and females in 34 and 43 states, respectively. Fifty-four percent of decedents in 27 states 
in 2015 did not have a known mental health condition. 
Among decedents with available information, several 
circumstances were significantly more likely among 
those without known mental health conditions than 
among those with mental health conditions, including 
relationship problems/loss (45.1% versus 39.6%), life 
stressors (50.5% versus 47.2%), and recent/impending 
crises (32.9% versus 26.0%), but these circumstances 
were common across groups.
Conclusions: Suicide rates increased significantly 
across most states during 1999–2016. Various 
circumstances contributed to suicides among persons 
with and without known mental health conditions.
Implications for Public Health Practice: States 
can use a comprehensive evidence-based public 
health approach to prevent suicide risk before it 
occurs, identify and support persons at risk, prevent 
reattempts, and help friends and family members in 
the aftermath of a suicide.

Introduction
In 2016, nearly 45,000 suicides (15.6/100,000 population 
[age-adjusted]) occurred in the United States among persons 
aged ≥10 years (1). From 1999 to 2015, suicide rates increased 
among both sexes, all racial/ethnic groups, and all urbanization 
levels (2,3). Suicide rates have also increased among persons in 
all age groups <75 years, with adults aged 45–64 having the 
largest absolute rate increase (from 13.2 per 100,000 persons 
[1999] to 19.2 per 100,000 [2016]) and the greatest number 
of suicides (232,108) during the same period (1,3). Suicide is 
the tenth leading cause of death and is one of just three leading 
causes that are increasing (1,4). In addition, rates of emergency 
department visits for nonfatal self-harm, a main risk factor 
for suicide, increased 42% from 2001 to 2016 (1). Together, 
suicides and self-harm injuries cost the nation approximately 
$70 billion per year in direct medical and work loss costs (1).
The National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (5) calls for a 
public health approach to suicide prevention with efforts span-
ning multiple levels (individual, family/relationship, community, 
and societal). Such a comprehensive approach underscores that 
suicide is rarely caused by any single factor, but rather, is deter-
mined by multiple factors. Despite this call to action, suicide 
prevention largely focuses on identifying and referring suicidal 
persons to mental health treatment and preventing reattempts 
(6). In addition to mental health conditions and prior suicide 
attempts, other contributing circumstances include social and 
economic problems, access to lethal means (e.g., substances, 
firearms) among persons at risk, and poor coping and problem-
solving skills (5). Expanded awareness of these additional circum-
stances contributing to suicide risk and action to address them can 
help reach the national goal, established by the National Action 
Alliance of Suicide Prevention and the American Foundation for 
Suicide Prevention, of reducing the annual suicide rate 20% by 
2025 (7). To assist states in achieving this goal, CDC analyzed 
state-specific trends in suicide rates and assessed the multiple 
contributing factors to suicide; this report presents options for 
strategies to include in comprehensive suicide prevention efforts 
that are based on the best available evidence.
Methods
Suicide rates were analyzed for persons aged ≥10 years 
because determining suicidal intent in younger children can be 
difficult (8). Age-specific suicide counts were tabulated based 
on National Vital Statistics System coded death certificate 
records (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, 
underlying-cause-of death codes X60–X84, Y87.0, U03). Age-
specific population estimates were obtained from U.S. Census 
Bureau/National Center for Health Statistics bridged-race 
population data releases.
National and state-level suicide rate estimates were calculated 
for six consecutive 3-year aggregate periods spanning 1999–
2016 (1999–2001; 2002–2004; 2005–2007; 2008–2010; 
2011–2013; and 2014–2016). Rate estimates were age-
adjusted to the U.S. 2000 standard population and expressed

per 100,000 persons per year. Age-adjusted suicide rate trends 
were modeled using the same 3-year data aggregates, employ-
ing weighted least-squares regression with inverse-variance 
weighting. Modeled rate trends are reported in terms of average 
annual percentage changes.
Characteristics of persons aged ≥10 years who died by suicide, 
with and without known mental health conditions, and the 
circumstances surrounding the suicides were compared in the 
27 states* with complete data participating in CDC’s National 
Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) in 2015. NVDRS 
defines mental health conditions as disorders and syndromes 
listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fifth Edition (9), with the exception of problematic alcohol use 
and other substance use that are captured separately in NVDRS. 
NVDRS aggregates data from three primary data sources: death 
certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports (including toxi-
cology), and law enforcement reports. A range of circumstances 
(relationship problems, life stressors, and recent or impending 
crises) have been identified as potential risk factors for suicide 
in NVDRS. Circumstances captured are those identified as con-
tributing to suicide in coroner/medical examiner or law enforce-
ment reports, which reflect information provided by family and 
friends at the time of death. Decedents could have experienced 
multiple circumstances. Decedents with and without known 
mental health conditions were compared using chi-square tests. 
Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate adjusted odds 
ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling 
for sex, age group, and race/ethnicity.
Results
The most recent overall suicide rates (representing 2014–
2016) varied fourfold, from 6.9 (District of Columbia) to 
29.2 (Montana) per 100,000 persons per year (Supplementary 
Table; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/53785). Across the 
study period, rates increased in all states except Nevada 
(where the rate was consistently high throughout the study 
period), with absolute increases ranging from 0.8 per 100,000 
(Delaware) to 8.1 (Wyoming). Percentage increases in rates 
ranged from 5.9% (Delaware) to 57.6% (North Dakota), with 
increases >30% observed in 25 states (Supplementary Table; 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/53785) (Figure).
Modeled suicide rate trends indicated significant increases 
in 44 states, among males (34 states) and females (43 states), 
as well as for the United States overall (Supplementary Table; 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/53785). Nationally, the model-
estimated average annual percentage change for the overall

suicide rate was an increase of 1.5%. By sex, estimated national 
rate trends further indicated significant average annual per-
centage change increases for males (1.1%) and females (2.6%) 
(Supplementary Table; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/53785).
Suicide decedents without known mental health conditions 
(11,039; 54.0%) were compared with those with known mental 
health conditions (9,407; 46.0%) for 27 states. Whereas dece-
dents were predominantly male (76.8%) (Table 1) and non-
Hispanic white (83.6%), those without known mental health 
conditions, relative to those with mental health conditions, 
were more likely to be male (83.6% versus 68.8%; odds ratio 
[OR] = 2.3, 95% CI = 2.2–2.5) and belong to a racial/ethnic 
minority (OR range = 1.2–2.0). Suicide decedents without 
known mental health conditions also had significantly higher 
odds of perpetrating homicide followed by suicide (aOR = 2.9, 
95% CI = 2.2–3.8). Among decedents aged ≥18 years, 20.1% 
of those without known mental health conditions and 15.3% 
of those with mental health conditions had previously served in 
the U.S. military or were serving at the time of death.
Whereas firearms were the most common method of suicide 
overall (48.5%), decedents without known mental health 
conditions were more likely to die by firearm (55.3%) and less 
likely to die by hanging/strangulation/suffocation (26.9%) or 
poisoning (10.4%) than were those with known mental health 
conditions (40.6%, 31.3%, and 19.8%, respectively). These 
differences remained significant in the adjusted models.
Toxicology testing was less likely to be performed for dece-
dents without known mental health conditions. Among those 
with toxicology results, decedents without known mental health

conditions were less likely to test positive for any substance 
overall (aOR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.7–0.8), including opioids 
(aOR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.81–0.99), but were more likely 
to test positive for alcohol (aOR = 1.2, 95%, CI = 1.1–1.3).
Information on circumstances surrounding suicide were 
available for all decedents with mental health conditions 
(9,407) and approximately 85% of those without known 
mental health conditions (9,357) in 27 states (Table 2). 
Persons without known mental health conditions were less 
likely to have any problematic substance use (aOR = 0.7, 
95% CI = 0.7–0.8) than were persons with known mental 
health conditions. Whereas two thirds of decedents with 
known mental health conditions had a history of mental health 
or substance use treatment (67.2%), just over half (54.0%) 
were in treatment at the time of death.
Decedents without known mental health conditions had a 
significantly higher likelihood of any relationship problem/loss 
(45.1%) than did those with known mental health conditions 
(39.6%), specifically intimate partner problems (30.2% ver-
sus 24.1%), arguments/conflicts (17.5% versus 13.6%), and 
perpetrating interpersonal violence in the past month (3.0% 
versus 1.4%). Decedents without known mental health condi-
tions were also more likely than were those with known mental 
health conditions to have experienced any life stressors (50.5% 
versus 47.2%) such as recent criminal legal problems (10.7% 
versus 6.2%) or eviction/loss of home (4.3% versus 3.4%) and 
were more likely to have had a recent or impending (within the 
preceding or upcoming 2 weeks, respectively) crisis (a current 
or acute event thought to contribute to the suicide) (32.9% ver-
sus 26.0%). All of these differences remained significant in the 
adjusted models. Physical health problems and job/financial 
problems were commonly contributing stressors among both 
persons without mental health conditions (23.2% and 15.6%, 
respectively) and those with mental health conditions (21.4%

and 16.8%, respectively). Similarly, among all persons with 
recent crises, intimate partner problems were the most com-
mon types and did not differ by group.
Decedents without known mental health conditions had 
significantly lower odds of recent release from any institu-
tion (aOR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.4–0.5). Among those recently 
released, decedents without known mental health conditions 
were significantly more likely than decedents with mental 
health conditions to have been released from a correctional 
facility (25.7% versus 8.7%), hospital (43.7% versus 33.0%), 
or other facility, such as an alcohol/substance use treatment 
facility (24.2% versus 11.6%). Among decedents with known 
mental health conditions who were recently released from an 
institution, 46.7% were released from psychiatric facilities.
Decedents without known mental health conditions were 
significantly less likely to have a history of suicidal ideation 
(23.0%) or prior suicide attempts (10.3%) compared with 
those with known mental health conditions (40.8% and 
29.4%, respectively). Suicide intent was disclosed by 22.4% 
and 24.5% of persons without and with known mental health 
conditions, respectively.
Conclusions and Comments
During 1999–2016, suicide rates increased significantly 
in 44 states, and 25 states experienced increases >30%. 
Rates increased significantly among males in 34 states, and 
females in 43 states. Additional research into the specific 
causes of these trends is needed. Data from the 27 states 
participating in NVDRS provide important insight into cir-
cumstances surrounding suicide and can help states identify 
prevention priorities.

Suicidologists regularly state that suicide is not caused by 
a single factor (5); however, suicide prevention is often ori-
ented toward mental health conditions alone with regard to 
downstream identification of suicidal persons, treatment of 
mental health conditions, and prevention of reattempts. This 
study found that approximately half of suicide decedents in 
NVDRS did not have a known mental health condition, 
indicating that additional focus on nonmental health factors 
further upstream could provide important information for a 
public health approach (10). Those without a known mental 
health condition suffered more from relationship problems and 
other life stressors such as criminal/legal matters, eviction/loss 
of home, and recent or impending crises.
Similarly, persons with mental health conditions also often 
experienced other circumstances such as relationship problems 
and job/financial or physical health problems that contributed 
to their suicide. These findings point to the need to both prevent 
the circumstances associated with the onset of mental health 
conditions and support persons with known mental health 
conditions to decrease their risk for poor outcomes (11). Two 
thirds of suicide decedents with mental health conditions had a 
history of treatment for mental health or substance use disorders,

with approximately half in treatment when they died. This find-
ing suggests the need for additional safety supports, including 
broader implementation of affordable and effective treatment 
modalities, such as doctor-patient collaborative care models and 
proven cognitive-behavioral therapies. In addition, increased 
access to behavioral health providers in underserved areas is 
needed, as is expansion of health care systems that integrate 
physical and behavioral health, with a priority on suicide preven-
tion and patient safety, especially through care transitions (12).
Comprehensive statewide suicide prevention activities are 
needed to address the full range of factors contributing to suicide. 
Prevention strategies include strengthening economic supports 
(e.g., housing stabilization policies, household financial support); 
teaching coping and problem-solving skills to manage everyday 
stressors and prevent future relationship problems, especially 
early in life; promoting social connectedness to increase a sense 
of belonging and access to informational, tangible, emotional, 
and social support; and identifying and better supporting 
persons at risk (e.g., military veterans, persons with physical/
mental health conditions) (12). Other strategies include creating 
protective environments (e.g., reducing access to lethal means 
among persons at risk for suicide, creating organizational and 
workplace policies to promote help-seeking, easing transitions 
into and out of work for persons with mental health conditions 
and other life challenges), strengthening access to and delivery of 
care, supporting family and friends after a suicide, and encourag-
ing the media to follow safe reporting recommendations (12). 
Some states, such as Colorado, are planning to implement such 
a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, in the state-level analysis, rankings for four states 
(Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Utah) might 
have been affected by large proportions of injury deaths of 
undetermined intent (potentially biasing reported suicide rates 
downward) or decreased percentages of such deaths over time 
(potentially biasing estimated rate trends upward). Second, 
NVDRS is not yet nationally representative; the 27 states 
included represent 49.6% of the population (https://factfinder.
census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml). 
Finally, abstractors of NVDRS data are limited to informa-
tion contained in investigative reports. Therefore, the extent of 
informant knowledge can affect data completeness and accuracy. 
Studies that include more in-depth interviews with next-of-kin 
often identify greater attributions to mental health disorders

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2016, nearly 45,000 persons died by suicide in the United States. 
Mental health conditions are one of several contributors to suicide.
What is added by this report?
During 1999–2016, suicide rates increased in nearly every 
state, including >30% increases in 25 states. 2015 data from 
27 states indicate 54% of suicide decedents were not known 
to have mental health conditions. Relationship, substance use, 
health, and job or financial problems are among the other 
circumstances contributing to suicide.
What are the implications for public health practice?
A comprehensive approach using proven prevention strategies, 
such as those in CDC’s Preventing Suicide: A Technical Package of 
Policy, Programs, and Practices, can help reach the national goal 
of reducing the annual suicide rate 20% by 2025.
(13); however, many methodological variations across studies 
exist (14). It is likely that some persons without known mental 
health conditions in the current study were experiencing men-
tal health challenges that were unknown, undiagnosed, or not 
reported by key informants. Nonetheless, the high prevalence of 
diverse contributing circumstances among those with and with-
out known mental health conditions suggests the importance of 
addressing the broad range of factors that contribute to suicide.
Suicide is a growing public health problem. Effective 
approaches to prevent the many suicide risk factors are avail-
able. States and communities can use data from NVDRS 
and resources such as CDC’s Preventing Suicide: A Technical 
Package of Policy, Programs, and Practices (12) to better under-
stand suicide in their populations, prioritize evidence-based 
comprehensive suicide prevention, and save lives.
