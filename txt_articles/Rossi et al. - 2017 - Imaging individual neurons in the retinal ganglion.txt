Although imaging of the living retina with adaptive optics scanning
light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) provides microscopic access to
individual cells, such as photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelial
cells, and blood cells in the retinal vasculature, other important cell
classes, such as retinal ganglion cells, have proven much more
challenging to image. The near transparency of inner retinal cells is
advantageous for vision, as light must pass through them to reach
the photoreceptors, but it has prevented them from being directly
imaged in vivo. Here we show that the individual somas of
neurons within the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer can be imaged
with a modification of confocal AOSLO, in both monkeys and
humans. Human images of RGC layer neurons did not match the
quality of monkey images for several reasons, including safety
concerns that limited the light levels permissible for human
imaging. We also show that the same technique applied to the
photoreceptor layer can resolve ambiguity about cone survival in
age-related macular degeneration. The capability to noninvasively
image RGC layer neurons in the living eye may one day allow for a
better understanding of diseases, such as glaucoma, and acceler-
ate the development of therapeutic strategies that aim to protect
these cells. This method may also prove useful for imaging other
structures, such as neurons in the brain.

L
ight traverses several layers of nearly transparent neurons
before reaching the photopigment in the photoreceptors,
initiating the first step in seeing. Information from photorecep-
tors is then relayed back through this tissue and processed by
numerous parallel neural circuits before reaching the retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs), whose axons form the optic nerve (1).
Retinal disease can impact any of several classes of retinal
neurons. However, vision loss from the diseases that cause the
most cases of acquired blindness in the world (2), age-related
macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma, is primarily due to
the progressive death of photoreceptors (3, 4) and RGCs (5),
respectively. Although adaptive optics (AO) ophthalmoscopy can
image photoreceptors, their survival can be uncertain when pa-
thology has altered the retina. RGCs and other inner retinal
neurons have proven difficult to image directly, even with AO (6).
New methods are needed to monitor these cell classes on a mi-
croscopic scale in the living eye to better understand the patho-
genesis and progression of these diseases and detect them earlier,
before irreversible cell death occurs.
Ordinary fundus cameras lack the axial resolution to selec-
tively image the different layers of the retina. Optical coherence
tomography, the standard for clinical assessment of RGCs in
glaucoma (7), permits gross measurement of all RGC axons to-
gether [i.e., retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness]. However,
segmenting just the RGC layer is difficult (8) and conventional
optical coherence tomography lacks the transverse resolution to
evaluate individual cells. A statistically significant RNFL thinning,
indicative of glaucomatous damage, may represent the death of
tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of RGCs (9). A
noninvasive in vivo imaging method permitting early detection of
morphological changes in RGCs at a cellular or subcellular level
would be transformative for understanding the early pathoge-
netic mechanisms of glaucoma and facilitate earlier diagnosis
and treatment (6).
AO enables near diffraction-limited imaging in the living eye
(10, 11). AO scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) (12) has
been used to investigate how our visual capabilities are formed
from discrete sampling by individual cones (13, 14), and how
disease alters the living retina at a cellular level (15–18). AOSLO
has proven to be a powerful platform for translating existing
microscopy and ophthalmoscopy methods for high-resolution
in vivo imaging. Off-axis detection methods, such as “dark-field”
(19), “offset-aperture” (20), and “split-detection” (21) have been
adapted to AOSLO to image the retinal pigment epithelium (22),
blood vessel walls (23), and putative cone inner segments (24).
Split-detection resolved uncertainty about cone survival in ach-
romatopsia (24) and may be useful for doing the same in AMD.
However, despite these continuous advances, several types of
retinal cells, including Müller, bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and
RGCs have remained inaccessible to imaging in humans.
Intrinsic two-photon excitation fluorescence (25) (TPEF) was
recently deployed in AOSLO to image monkeys and resolved
structural features at multiple retinal layers. Contrast is achieved
Significance
Retinal ganglion cells are the primary output neurons of the
retina that process visual information and transmit it to the
brain. We developed a method to reveal these cells in the living
eye that does not require the fluorescent labels or high light
levels that characterize more invasive methods. The death of
these cells causes vision loss in glaucoma, the second leading
cause of blindness worldwide. The ability to image these cells
in the living eye could accelerate our understanding of their
role in normal vision and provide a diagnostic tool for evalu-
ating new therapies for retinal disease.

TPEF revealed Müller cells and RGC layer neurons in monkeys
and was validated through ex vivo tissue comparisons (26).
However, a significant limitation of TPEF is the need for high
light levels that restrict its use to animals. More work is needed
to optimize TPEF for safe human imaging. In the meantime, off-
axis detection methods offer promise for imaging these cells.
These methods share the property that they integrate photons
from regions of the retinal conjugate focal plane other than that
sampled by the usual confocal pinhole centered on the optical
axis, and differ primarily in the specific regions light is detected
from and in the number of detectors used (Fig. S1). The expla-
nation for the difference between these modalities and conven-
tional on-axis confocal imaging put forth by Elsner et al., is that
shifting detection away from the optical axis increases the frac-
tion of light reaching the detector that is multiply scattered by
the retina (20, 23, 27). Here we sought through empirical in-
vestigations to better understand how detection can be optimized
to image the nearly transparent inner retina.
We used the simplest off-axis detection scheme, offset-aperture
(20, 23), and explored how offset distance (that we extend to po-
sitions far beyond those previously measured), offset direction, and
aperture size impacted image content in both monkeys and humans.
We then combined images from different aperture positions to en-
hance structural contrast. Because our ultimate goal was to image
RGCs in humans but we had no secondary mechanism to identify
these cells (e.g., TPEF), we imaged macaque monkeys, an animal with
a retina similar to humans, using simultaneous TPEF (26) to validate
the approach. Here we show that by combining multiple offset-
aperture images, structural contrast can be enhanced through the
entire retinal thickness and that the somas of individual cells within
the RGC layer can be revealed using this “multioffset” approach.
Results
Outer Retina. Individual rods and cones were visible at all offsets
(Fig. 1 A–K and M–W) in monkeys, albeit with variable contrast
as signal intensity dropped considerably with increasing offset.
Cones were clearly discernable and in register in all imaging
modes but rod visibility varied (Fig. S2); it should be noted that
rod imaging was not optimized in confocal (and perhaps offset-
aperture) as a relatively large aperture and long wavelength of
light was used. Most cones had a characteristic appearance in
offset-aperture of an intensity gradient across the cell, with the
gradient oriented orthogonal to offset direction. This asymmetry is
illustrated in the SD image (Fig. 1X), where brighter pixels rep-
resent higher SD and most cones appear as bright rings. Differ-
encing offset-aperture images enhanced photoreceptor contrast
(Fig. 1Y). Low spatial frequency contrast that may be derived from
the absorption/scattering properties of the underlying retinal pig-
ment epithelium or choroid was visible at all offsets.
Offset-aperture images of humans similarly showed an oriented
gradient of intensity across most cones (Fig. S3). Confocal AOSLO
images of an AMD patient showed gaps in the cone mosaic (Fig.
S3E, arrow), but multioffset images revealed cones in correspond-
ing areas (e.g., Fig. S3N, arrow). Offset-aperture images could be
combined in numerous ways to enhance contrast (Fig. S3 J–N).
Feature contrast usually improved when offset-aperture images
were differenced and could appear very similar to split-detection
(Fig. S3O), depending on the images combined. The best subjective
feature contrast was often generated when images from aperture
positions on exact opposite sides of the point spread function (PSF)
were differenced; however, this was not always the case.
It is often difficult to visualize cones in confocal AOSLO (Fig.
2A) in areas where drusen or early atrophy are seen clinically
(Fig. S4); these cones may be misaligned, lacking outer segments,
or lost completely. However, more cones could be visualized
near drusen and in areas of early atrophy in multioffset images
(Fig. 2B). A contiguous mosaic of cones was seen in some re-
gions where cones were not visible in the confocal image (Fig. 2,
arrows). Multioffset images also revealed discrete circular sub-
structures within drusen (Fig. 2B, arrowhead); corresponding
areas contained structures consistent with cones in the confocal
image (Fig. 2A, arrowhead).
Focusing Through the Retina. Multioffset is compared with TPEF
and confocal at multiple focal planes in a monkey in Fig. 3. As
demonstrated previously (26), mosaic-like or lamina-like struc-
tures were visible in TPEF images captured at different planes
throughout the retinal thickness (Fig. 3, Center column). These
structures were indistinct at some focal planes (Fig. 3 E and H)
but cells were visible at the RGC layer (Fig. 3B), where they
appeared as bright TPEF surrounded by a dark center (pre-
sumably the cell nucleus) (26, 28, 29). Multioffset images showed
similar cellular features (Fig. 3C) that were often in nearly perfect
register with the cells seen in TPEF (Fig. S5). Corresponding
confocal images (Fig. 3A) lacked the characteristic pattern of axon
bundles typically seen, as these bundles are sparse or not present
in this area of the temporal raphe.
Similar to TPEF, contrast for mosaic-like features was di-
minished in multioffset at the next two deeper focal planes (Fig. 3 F
Fig. 1.
Offset-aperture images (A–K and M–W) show characteristic intensity
gradients across cones. Images positioned to reflect sampling pattern (ap-
erture: ∼4 ADD; offset: ∼8–21 ADD). SD of offset-aperture images (X) re-
flects asymmetry as cones appear as rings. Differencing enhances contrast; Y
is the difference of P and H. Confocal (L) and TPEF (Z) shown for comparison.
Light was focused to maximum cone TPEF, assumed to be at plane of cone
outer segments. Images are 100 × 100 μm.
Fig. 2.
Cones were not visible in some areas adjacent to drusen or on margin
of hypo-autofluorescence (see Fig. S4) in confocal AOSLO (A, arrows) but
multioffset images (B, arrows) showed a contiguous cone mosaic in some of
these regions. Drusen substructures were seen in multioffset images as well
circumscribed circular features (B, arrowhead); cones were visible at corre-
sponding locations in confocal image (A, arrowhead). Corresponding clinical
images are shown in Fig. S4. (Scale bar, 50 μm.)

 and I). Retinal blood vessels (and the cells flowing through them)
are usually the only well-defined microscopic structures visible in
confocal AOSLO between the inner and outer layers of the neural
retina (12) and, as expected, vessels were visible in confocal images
at these planes (Fig. 3 D, G, and J) but little other discernable
cellular structure was seen. When focused on the lumen of a blood
vessel in these intermediate focal planes, certain multioffset de-
tection configurations either enhanced or nearly completely mini-
mized vessel contrast (Fig. S6).
TPEF and multioffset images from the same layers appeared
to contain some different information, particularly at inner and
intermediate layers. It is possible that photoreceptor nuclei were
visible in multioffset at a focal plane just above the photoreceptor
inner segments (Fig. 3L); this image also contained structures that
appeared as horizontal striations, the origin of which is unknown.
Putative cone inner segments were discernable in both TPEF and
multioffset at the next deeper focal plane (Fig. 3 N and O). As
shown in Fig. 1, rods and cone outer segments were visible in all
imaging modalities at the deepest focal plane imaged (Fig. 3 P–R).
Some sparsely arranged cones appeared darker in TPEF images
(Fig. 3 K, N, and Q); these were most likely S-cones that, because
of their relative insensitivity to the two-photon excitation wave-
length, produced less retinol (the candidate fluorophore) than
L- and M-cones.
Inner Retina. RGC layer somal contrast varied depending on
distance from the PSF (Fig. 4). Offset-aperture images from
positions nearest to the PSF [offset = 8 Airy disk diameter
(ADD)] did not contain visually discernable somas (Fig. 4A). It
was only at the more distant aperture positions (∼13.7–20.1
ADD) that they became visible (Fig. 4 B and C). The SD image
from all offset-aperture images enhanced the contrast of some
cells, particularly those near a large blood vessel (Fig. 4D, Left).
Differencing of offset-aperture images from the more distant
positions improved cell contrast substantially (Fig. 4 E and F).
However, not all cells were visible across the field-of-view of a
single difference image (compare arrows and arrowheads in Fig.
4 E and F). Averaging several multioffset images allowed somas
to be visualized across the entire field-of-view (Fig. 4G). Distinct
subcellular features were visible within some somas, including
putative cell nuclei and nucleoli (Fig. 4 H–K). High light levels
were not required to obtain images of individual somas, as the
same cells were visible at the lower levels typically used in hu-
mans (Fig. S7).
Cellular structure consistent with inner retinal neuron somas
was also seen in multioffset images of the RGC layer of two
different normal human eyes (Fig. 5). Somas were visible in each
despite minor differences in detection pattern. Images in Fig. 5A
were acquired with a radial sampling pattern (3.4 ADD aperture;
11.9 ADD offset; 36° intervals) using near infrared (NIR) light;
the averages of three offset-aperture images were differenced to
generate the multioffset image (similar to Fig. S3M). Images in
Fig. 5B were also acquired using NIR light with a radial sampling
pattern but with a larger aperture and greater offset (7.2 ADD
aperture; 13.4 ADD offset; 60° intervals); several difference
images were averaged to generate the multioffset image in Fig.
5B (similar to Fig. 4G). Overlying axon bundles did not appear to
obstruct cell somas, as they were visible even in locations where
axon bundles were present in the confocal image (Fig. S8B) and
often lined up along the axon bundles. This characteristic mor-
phometry of RGC layer neurons known from ex vivo microscopy
(30) was also seen in monkey images (Fig. S9).
Mean equivalent somal diameter was 12.8 μm (range: 4–31.9;
SD: 3.9; n = 502) for the monkey images and 12.6 μm (range:
5.2–22; SD: 2.7; n = 492) for the human images. Mean somal
area was 141.6 μm2 (range: 12.9–797; SD: 87.5; n = 502) for the
monkey images and 130.7 μm2 (range: 21.2–382.2; SD: 55.3; n =
492) for the human images. The distribution of cell sizes com-
puted for the ∼500 cells segmented from RGC layer images of
each species (one monkey and two humans), from images shown
herein (e.g., in Figs. 4 and 5 and Fig. S9), and additional images
of surrounding areas, were within the range expected from the
literature (Fig. 6 and Fig. S10).

layer in TPEF (B) and multioffset (C) images but not confocal (A). Focal planes
between the outer and inner layers contained laminar and mosaic-like
structures in TPEF (E and H) and multioffset (F and I). Photoreceptor somas
may be visible in TPEF and multioffset at the next focal plane (K and L).
When focused at a more inner plane, cones appeared differently in multioffset
(O) than at a deeper plane (R), where they appear similar to cones in split-
detection. Approximate axial depth relative to the ganglion cell layer: (A–C)

 Discussion
Individual somas of RGC layer neurons can be imaged directly in
the living eye of monkeys and humans using existing AOSLO
instrumentation with only minor modifications. Photoreceptor
pathology in AMD can also be visualized with this method that
enhances cone contrast in a similar manner to split-detection
(24). The capability to image individual neurons through the full
thickness of the retina could be transformative for the study of
human retinal diseases. However, the demonstration of an im-
aging capability in a small number of eyes, such as we have shown
here, does not necessarily guarantee that it can be quickly deployed
productively in the clinic. As we have seen with the development of
in vivo photoreceptor imaging (31), for example, improvements are
still being made two decades later to translate this capability into a
clinically useful tool. Human images of RGC layer neurons did not
match the quality of those from the monkey for several reasons,
chief among them being the much lower light levels used for safety
concerns. Nonetheless, refinements using existing technologies,
particularly those recently developed for autofluorescence imaging
(32, 33), have the potential to improve image quality (SI Materials
and Methods).
More work is needed to determine a success rate for multi-
offset RGC layer imaging and document reproducibility in hu-
mans. Although the photoreceptor layer was successfully imaged
in all eyes tested, we modified our detection strategy to improve
RGC layer imaging as new data were acquired, so each individual
was not imaged using the same detection configuration, pre-
venting a success rate from being determined from the present
data. Based on monkey results, it appears that many of our early
attempts to image inner retinal neurons in humans were not
successful because we did not use an appropriate combination of
aperture size and offset. Monkey results demonstrated re-
producibility (Fig. S7) and axial sectioning comparable to con-
focal AOSLO (Fig. 3), but the axial resolution of multioffset
detection and its usefulness at eccentricities where the RGC layer
is thicker and consists of many layers of cells needs further study.
Measurement of somal size in populations of RGC layer
neurons may be advantageous for studying glaucoma pathogenesis
and response to treatment, as mean RGC area has been shown to
decrease in glaucoma before cell death (34). Subcellular resolu-
tion could also reveal in vivo the substantial changes that sub-
cellular structures undergo during apoptosis in glaucoma (35).
This level of resolution may also permit RGCs to be differentiated
from the displaced amacrine cells that represent a larger pro-
portion of RGC layer somas as distance from the fovea increases
(36), although whether this is possible remains to be demon-
strated. In humans, the percentage of amacrine cell somas in the
RGC layer rises from ∼15% at 3 mm to ∼25% at 4 mm (36).
Fig. 4.
Somas were not visible in offset-aperture images nearest to the PSF (A) but were visible at more distant positions (B and C). The SD image increased
the contrast of some somas, particularly cells adjacent to a blood vessel on the left edge (D). Multioffset difference images enhanced somal contrast (E and F),
but not all cells were visible across each image (e.g., cell in E, arrowheads vs. cell in F, arrows). Averaging many difference images and enhancing local contrast
with contrast limited histogram equalization, improved cell contrast, and visualized cells across the entire field-of-view (G). Some cells had visible subcellular
structures (H–K). Arrows in G denote locations of H–K. Somas outlined with solid lines (I and K) contained putative nuclei (dashed circles) and nucleoli (dotted
circles). Insets in A–G show detection pattern; shaded circle is aperture position of offset-aperture image (A–C) or multioffset images (D–G); dot is 1 ADD and

 Assuming monkey proportions are similar, ∼20% of the cells in
our images (from 3 to 4 mm) are likely displaced amacrine cells.
Somas of several types of amacrine cells exist in the RGC layer.
Some rare types have large somas similar in size to parasol RGCs
(37), but most are relatively small (i.e., <10 μm diameter) (36–38).
We assume that the vast majority of cells in our sample are RGCs
(75–85%), with ∼95% of those being midget RGCs (39).
Somal size distributions (Fig. 6 and Fig. S10) fell within the
expected range for the cell types assumed to be present based on
data from the literature (34–45). However, this is the first in vivo
dataset, so direct comparisons are not possible. Sharma et al.
(26) did not measure somal diameter in their TPEF images; this
would be difficult because TPEF contrast appears to be from the
cell nucleus (26, 28, 29). We did not see a bimodal distribution of
somal diameters, as Curcio et al. (36) did, likely because of the
relatively smaller proportion of larger somas present in our
samples from 3 to 4 mm than theirs at 5 mm, where the percentage
of larger parasol RGCs is greater (∼20%) (39). We saw only a
small percentage of cells greater than 20 μm in diameter (∼3.5% in
humans and ∼8.8% in the monkey); these values are close to ex-
pectations from the literature for human, but perhaps a little high
for monkey (36–44). However, it is likely that there are inaccura-
cies in our segmentation because of the low contrast of somas in
the human images (Fig. S8 C and D) and because of the contrast
of subcellular structures (such as putative cell nuclei) for some
larger cells in monkey images (Fig. S5). More work is needed to
develop unbiased segmentation methods for these images.
Despite the success of off-axis detection methods for visualizing
retinal structure, they lack a complete theoretical framework. Elsner
et al. (20, 23) have suggested light backscattered from the retina
forms the core of the PSF that is detected in confocal imaging,
whereas the light outside that area is more laterally scattered, mul-
tiply scattered, or scattered from different focal planes (20). In this
framework, the scattering properties of the structures present at the
position of the focused point source in the retina govern the pro-
portion of light that falls within and outside the confocal detection
area. For example, the strong waveguide properties of cones (46, 47)
ensure that a large proportion of the light that returns from the
photoreceptor layer is highly directionally backscattered, making
them particularly well-suited targets for confocal imaging; empirical
results are consistent with this expectation.
Monkey photoreceptor layer results suggest that contrast en-
hancement for normal cones is not affected much by the direction
or distance of the offset from the center of the PSF (Fig. 1). In the
multiply scattered light-detection framework, it appears that light
from healthy cones is symmetrically detectable in all directions
outside the confocal area. Contrary to cones, blood vessels appear
to be very asymmetrically scattering structures (Fig. S6), scattering
light that interacts with them to areas outside the core of the PSF in
a direction normal to the surface of the vessel wall. RGC layer
somas were somewhat more variable, as some were visible regard-
less of offset direction (as long as the offset distance was sufficient)
but not all cells could be seen across the field-of-view of each image
(Fig. 4). It is not clear why a greater offset was required to image
RGC layer neurons relative to photoreceptors and vasculature. We
are currently developing an optical model to better understand this
phenomenon and the mechanism of cellular contrast.
Some ambiguity exists as to the source of the signal in split-
detection thought to arise from cone inner segments (24). Multi-
offset images appeared similar to split-detection (24) at a focal
plane assumed to be near the outer segments (Fig. 3R). However,
at a plane assumed to be closer to the inner segments, their ap-
pearance changed (Fig. 3O). This may result from improved axial
resolution in multioffset because of the smaller light-collection
apertures used. Thus, some of the signal in split-detection attrib-
uted to inner segments may arise from the outer segments. It is
possible that inner segments are visualized best in split-detection
when outer segments are lost or misaligned. However, our results
suggest that success in imaging misaligned cones in split-detection
may depend on the orientation of the split. Future work is needed
to more precisely compare these two closely related methods.
Multioffset detection may be advantageous for imaging some
forms of pathology compared with split-detection where only a
single detection configuration is possible (because of the fixed na-
ture of the split). Similar to what Scoles et al. showed for achro-
matopsia with split-detection (24), the multioffset method could
visualize cone structure in AMD patients in locations where cone
presence was ambiguous or cones were absent in the confocal im-
age. Our results suggest multioffset detection can be optimized to
visualize cones altered by AMD (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3). Other features,
such as the well-circumscribed discrete circular substructures within
drusen that we observed (Fig. 2B, arrowhead), warrant further study
and may provide insight into drusen formation and development.
Future study should also be directed at more sophisticated sorting/
combining of images and a more efficient mechanism for sampling
the light distribution at the retinal conjugate focal plane.
A perhaps ideal approach would be to sample the entire focal
plane with a matrix detector, where all “offsets” are acquired
simultaneously. Such a detection scheme could be implemented
in other imaging systems (e.g., scanning laser microscopy) and
potentially be useful for imaging other nearly transparent tissues,
such as neurons in the brain. Simultaneous acquisition could solve
many problems encountered in human imaging; it would obviate
the need for a separate confocal channel and ensure all images are
acquired from the exact same location. Imaging duration could be
substantially reduced, permitting the use of higher light levels that
could further improve image quality. With sufficient detector
sensitivity and sampling density, it would also allow for shaping of
the detection configuration arbitrarily and after imaging (e.g., by
binning detection units). This flexibility would allow images formed
and combined to be altered in postprocessing to optimize them for
the imaging conditions and structures of interest. We demonstrated
here that when a point source is imaged onto the retina in AOSLO,
valuable information exists across the entire aerial image plane;
future work should determine the most efficient way to harvest
this light.

Somal diameter distribution (A) was within the expected range (B).
Means (±2 SD) are compared with values from the literature in B. Data points in B
are mean (±2 SD) of measurements digitized for eccentricities of 2–4 mm from
figures 4 in ref. 42, 8 in ref. 44, and 16 in ref. 41. Values are from text of ref. 43 for
a 10-mm-diameter area centered on the fovea and from a retinal eccentricity of
4–8 mm for ref. 45.

after the experiment was described both verbally and in writing. All experiments
were approved by the research subjects review board of the University of
Rochester and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Multioffset Imaging. Experiments were carried out on three different AOSLO
systems capable of simultaneous confocal and off-axis detection: a human
research AOSLO (48, 49), a compact commercial prototype human AOSLO (50),
and a nonhuman primate two-photon AOSLO (TPAOSLO) (26, 51). Some hu-
mans were imaged on both systems, permitting comparison between systems,
but some major differences between them prevented direct comparisons (see
SI Materials and Methods for details). On the research instruments, at each
retinal location and focal plane, image sequences were obtained at several
offset-aperture positions across the 2D retinal conjugate focal plane. Images
were obtained at retinal eccentricities of 3–4 mm temporal to the fovea,
within or superior to the raphe. Because of factors including light scatter,
residual aberrations, and the double-pass nature of AOSLO, the PSF at the
retinal conjugate focal plane is much broader than the theoretical ADD (22).
However, for convenience and reproducibility, all detection parameters are
expressed in these units. Aperture diameters tested ranged in size from ∼1.2 to
9 ADD. Two detection patterns were used: “radial,” with apertures offset to a
fixed distance from the center of the PSF at various angles (Fig. S1E), and
“triangular,” with positions arranged in a triangular grid (Fig. S1F). We tested
several different radial patterns in humans, in a range of offsets from 6 to 14
ADD, and both patterns in monkeys, with offsets extending to beyond 20
ADD. We imaged the outer retina in AMD patients and both inner and outer
retina in normal eyes. Precision aperture positioning and image-processing
methods are described in detail in SI Materials and Methods.
Macaque Experiments. For macaque experiments, animals were handled in
accordance with the protocols prescribed and approved by the University of
Rochester’s committee for animal research and in accordance with the As-
sociation for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Animal Statement for
the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.
