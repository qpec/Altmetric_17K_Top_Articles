abstract
OBJECTIVES: To assess the prospective associations between mother-adolescent and father-
adolescent relationship quality and early sexual intercourse initiation (ie, ≤16 years) among 
a large sample of Dutch adolescents.
METHODS: Two waves of data from the Rotterdam Youth Monitor, a longitudinal study in the 
Netherlands, were used. The analysis sample consisted of 2931 adolescents aged 12 to 16 
years (Meanage@T1 = 12.5 years, SD = 0.61; Meanage@T2 = 14.3 years, SD = 0.60). Variables 
were assessed by means of self-report questionnaires. Prospective associations between 
mother-adolescent and father-adolescent relationships and early sexual initiation were 
assessed by logistic regression analyses, stratified by gender, controlling for various 
potential confounders.
RESULTS: We found that only girls (not boys) having a higher-quality relationship with 
mothers were significantly less likely to have initiated early sexual intercourse between 
T1 and T2. Bivariate findings showed that both girls and boys having a higher-quality 
relationship with their father at T1 were significantly less likely to have engaged in early 
sexual intercourse between T1 and T2, but when assessed multivariately, these associations 
were no longer significant, neither for boys nor for girls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a higher-quality relationship between adolescents 
and their parents, especially between mothers and daughters, may help to protect against 
early sexual initiation. Pediatricians and other health care professionals should be able to 
explain to parents that early sexual intercourse initiation can be associated with negative 
health outcomes, but that parents can play an important role in promoting healthy sexual 
behaviors.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: A poor parent-
adolescent relationship has been associated with 
early sexual intercourse in adolescence; however, 
most studies have focused only on the role of mothers. 
Hence, only a little is known about the role of fathers.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Using a prospective 
design, this study assessed the role of fathers 
additionally to the role of mothers in the associations 
between mother-adolescent and father-adolescent 
relationship quality and early sexual intercourse 
initiation in a large population of Dutch adolescents.

Adolescence is a period in which 
many adolescents start exploring 
intimate relationships and sexual 
behaviors, including intercourse. 
1, 
 
2 
Although the initiation of sexual 
intercourse is a normative step in 
adolescents’ sexual development, 
 
1, 
 
2 
early sexual intercourse initiation 
(ie, before the average age) may 
be problematic.3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
12 Early sexual 
intercourse has been associated 
with risky sexual behaviors (eg, 
unprotected sex), 
3 
 
– 
6 sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs), 
 
7 
– 
10 
and unwanted pregnancy. 
7, 
 
11 Early 
sexual starters tend to lack social, 
emotional, and cognitive skills 
that are normally gained with 
general life experiences, including 
experiences with romantic and 
sexual partnerships.13 
– 
15 In addition, 
early sexual starters have limited 
knowledge about the risks involved 
in unprotected sexual intercourse, 
such as the possibility of contracting 
STIs. 
16 These specificities of young 
adolescents may partly explain why 
early sexual intercourse is associated 
with negative outcomes. 
13 
– 
16 
Understanding the determinants 
of early sexual intercourse may 
contribute to promote effective 
preventive strategies to improve 
adolescents’ sexual health.
According to the ecological systems 
theory, both the social environment 
(eg, family) and the quality of the 
relationships within the social 
environment (eg, parent-adolescent 
relationships), play a role in 
adolescents’ sexual development. 
17 
The literature consistently shows 
that a poor parent-adolescent 
relationship quality, defined as 
adolescents’ perception of little 
warmth, support, and closeness in 
the relationship with their parents, 
 
18 
is associated with a higher likelihood 
of engaging in sexual intercourse 
at an early age. 
19 
 
– 
23 However, most 
studies on the parent-adolescent 
relationship quality and adolescents’ 
sexual behavior have focused only 
on the role of mothers. 
19 
–
21 This can 
be partly explained by a cultural 
aspect; in many societies mothers 
are the primary caregivers of 
children, and the primary providers 
of education on sexuality, for both 
boys and girls. 
24 
– 
26 Recently, studies 
have begun to look at the role 
of fathers in adolescents’ sexual 
development, showing that, for 
instance, fathers’ involvement may 
positively affect their children’s 
sexual development. 
27– 
29 To the 
authors’ knowledge, 2 studies have 
investigated the association between 
the quality of the father-adolescent 
relationship and adolescents’ sexual 
intercourse initiation. 
27, 
 
28 These 2 
studies found that adolescents who 
reported higher-quality relationships 
with their fathers at baseline 
(age = 15–
19 years) were less likely to 
report sexual intercourse experience 
at follow-up (age = 16–
19 years). 
27, 
28 
However, 1 study included girls only, 
 
28 and both studies were conducted 
in the United States. 
27, 
 
28 As mother-
adolescent and father-adolescent 
relationships may differ for boys and 
girls, 
 
19, 
30 
 
– 
33 and vary across cultures, 
 
34 
results from these studies may not 
be generalizable to all adolescents or 
other countries.
In the current study, we assessed 
prospective associations between 
mother-adolescent and father-
adolescent relationship quality 
and early sexual intercourse 
initiation among Dutch adolescents, 
defined as first sexual intercourse 
experience before the age of 16 
years, which is the average age at 
which Dutch adolescents initiate 
sexual intercourse (ie 16.7 years). 
Firstly, based on previous studies’ 
findings, 
 
19 
 
 
–
23, 
 
35, 
 
36 we hypothesized 
that adolescents who would report 
a higher-quality relationship with 
their mother and/or father would 
be less likely to initiate early sexual 
intercourse at ≤16 years. Second, 
as the literature also shows that 
the associations between parent-
adolescent relationship quality and 
the timing of sexual intercourse are 
stronger for girls than for boys, 
19, 
 
30 
– 
33 
we hypothesized that a higher-quality 
relationship with their mother and/
or father would be more strongly 
associated with a lower likelihood of 
engaging in early sexual intercourse 
for girls than for boys.
METHODS
Study Design
We used data that were collected 
as part of the Rotterdam Youth 
Monitor (RYM), a longitudinal youth 
health surveillance system that is 
incorporated into the preventive 
youth health care system of 
Rotterdam, 1 of the 4 largest cities 
in the Netherlands. 
37 Data were 
collected among a community 
sample of adolescents who were 
enrolled in secondary schools located 
in Rotterdam and surroundings. 
For the current study, data from 
2 waves were used, with a 2-year 
interval between measurements. 
At T1 (2008–
2009), 76 schools and 
8272 students in the first year of 
secondary school participated in the 
measurement (ie, 100% school and 
95% student participation rate). At 
T2 (2010–
2011), 45 schools and 
3184 students participated in the 
follow-up measurement (ie, 59% 
school and 38% student participation 
rate). The main reason for 
nonresponse at follow-up was that 
some schools were no longer able to 
participate. 
37 Administration of the 
questionnaires at schools was guided 
by trained researchers, school nurses 
from the Municipal Public Health 
Service, and teachers.
Study Sample
For our analyses, we selected 
only students who participated in 
both measurements (n = 3184). 
In addition, to be able to predict 
the initiation of early sexual 
intercourse (ie, ≤16 years), we 
selected only participants who 
never had sexual intercourse at T1 
(n = 70 excluded) and who were

≤16 years old at both T1 and T2 
(n = 3 excluded). Furthermore, we 
excluded participants with missing 
information on the following 
variables: age at T1 and/or at T2 
(n = 3), mother-adolescent or father-
adolescent relationship quality at 
T1 (n = 167), and sexual intercourse 
at T1 and/or at T2 (n = 10). Results 
from χ2 tests and 1-way analyses 
of variance (ANOVAs) showed that 
adolescents who were included in 
the final analysis sample (n = 2931) 
were more often younger (P < .01), 
enrolled in higher educational 
levels (P < .001), non-native Dutch 
(P < .001), more often lived with 
both biological parents (P < .001), 
and also reported a higher-quality 
relationship with their mother 
(P < .001) than adolescents who 
were excluded from the analyses 
(n = 4808).
Ethics Statement
Activities of the preventive youth 
health care system of Rotterdam, of 
which the RYM is part, have been 
approved by the Dutch government. 
The data of the RYM are protected 
by the Municipal Health Service of 
Rotterdam, which follows the Code 
of Conduct Health Research of the 
Netherlands. Adolescents received 
verbal information about the 
questionnaires each time they were 
applied, and their parents received 
written information regarding 
every assessment. Adolescents and 
their parents were free to decline 
participation. The questionnaires 
were completed on a voluntary basis, 
and confidentiality of responses 
was guaranteed. 
38 Observational 
research (ie, not experimental) 
with confidential data gathered in 
routine health care does not fall 
within the ambit of the Dutch Act on 
research involving human subjects, 
and therefore does not require the 
approval of an ethics review board; 
separate informed consent was 
therefore not required. 
37 Data were 
de-identified before the analyses.
Measures
Early Sexual Intercourse
Early sexual intercourse was 
measured using 1 item: “Have you 
ever had sexual intercourse? (With 
sexual intercourse we mean penile-
vaginal intercourse)” (1 = never; 
2 = once; 3 = a couple of times; 4 = 
regularly). For the present analyses, 
the item was dichotomized (0 = 
never; 1 = ever). 
39
Mother-Adolescent Relationship
The quality of the mother-
adolescent relationship was 
measured at baseline by using the 
Family Attachment Scale of The 
Communities That Care Youth 
Survey, for which a good validity and 
reliability have been reported. 
18, 
 
40, 
 
41 
This scale included 3 items (ie, “Do 
you feel close to your mother?” “Do 
you share your thoughts and feelings 
with your mother?” “Do you enjoy 
spending time with your mother?”), 
which were scored on a 4-point 
scale (0 = NO!; 1 = no; 2 = yes; 3 = 
YES!). A total score was calculated by 
averaging the scores on the 3 items 
(α = 0.72), where higher scores mean 
higher-quality mother-adolescent 
relationship (Mean = 2.60).
Father-Adolescent Relationship
The quality of the father-adolescent 
relationship was operationalized 
in the same way as the mother-
adolescent relationship quality, but 
“mother” was replaced by “father” in 
the 3 items (α = 0.78; Mean = 2.44).
Parental Monitoring
Parental monitoring was included 
as a potential confounder, and was 
assessed as the level at which parents 
monitored adolescents’ behaviors. 
41 
This variable was also measured 
at baseline by using the Family 
Attachment Scale, 
 
40 by 5 items (ie, 
“When I am not at home, one of my 
parents knows where I am and who 
I am with”; “My parents ask if I’ve 
gotten my homework done”; “Would 
your parents know if you did not 
come home on time?”; “My family has 
clear rules about alcohol and drug 
use”; “Would your parents find out 
if you were using drugs?”), which 
were scored on a 4-point scale (0 = 
NO!; 1 = no; 2 = yes; 3 = YES!). A total 
score was calculated by averaging 
the scores on the 5 items (α = 0.71), 
where higher scores mean a higher 
level of parental monitoring (Mean = 
2.42).
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were used 
to portray the analysis sample 
characteristics at baseline. One-
way ANOVA tests were applied to 
compare differences in T1 variables 
between adolescents who did and 
did not engage in early sexual 
intercourse between T1 and T2. 
Prospective associations between 
mother-adolescent and father-
adolescent relationship quality and 
early sexual intercourse initiation 
were assessed by a series of logistic 
regression analyses, stratified by 
gender. In the first 2 regression 
models, mother-adolescent 
relationship quality and father-
adolescent relationship quality were 
included in the models separately. In 
the third model, mother-adolescent 
and father-adolescent relationship 
quality were added to the model 
simultaneously, to adjust for each 
other’s independent contribution. We 
also tested gender-interaction effects 
(ie, gender × mother-adolescent 
relationships, gender × father-
adolescent relationships), to assess 
whether the found effects from the 
stratified analyses were indeed really 
statistically different for boys and 
girls. All regression models included 
the following potential confounders: 
gender, 
 
39 age, 
 
39 educational level, 
 
19, 
 
ethnic background, 
 
42 family 
structure, 
42 
– 
44 and parental 
monitoring. 
45 
–
47 A significance 
level of P < .05 was used to indicate 
significant effects.

RESULTS
The final sample for the prospective 
analyses included 2931 adolescents 
aged 12 to 16 years (Meanage@T1 = 
12.5 years, SD = 0.61; Meanage@T2 = 
14.3 years, SD = 0.60).  
Table 1 
presents participants’ descriptive 
characteristics at T1. A total of 233 
adolescents (8.0%), including 77 girls 
(2.6%) and 156 boys (5.4%), had 
initiated sexual intercourse between 
T1 and T2.
 
Table 2 shows the bivariate 
differences in T1 parenting variables 
between early and later sexual 
initiators. Girls who had initiated 
sexual intercourse between T1 
and T2 scored significantly lower 
on parental monitoring and on 
relationship quality with their 
mothers and fathers than girls who 
had not initiated sex. Boys who had 
initiated sexual intercourse between 
T1 and T2 scored significantly lower 
on parental monitoring and on 
relationship quality with their fathers 
than boys who had not initiated sex.
Results from the logistic regression 
analyses stratified by gender ( 
Table 3) 
show that for girls, higher-quality 
relationship with mothers (Crude 
Model Mothers) and with fathers 
(Crude Model Fathers) were 
significantly associated with a lower 
likelihood of early sexual intercourse 
initiation. However, when mothers 
and fathers were combined in 1 
model simultaneously (Full Model), 
only higher-quality relationship 
with mothers remained a significant 
protective factor against early sexual 
intercourse initiation, whereas the 
relationship with fathers became 
nonsignificant ( 
Table 3).
For boys, neither relationship 
(with mothers or fathers) was 
significantly associated with early 
sexual initiation, neither in the Crude 
models, nor in the Full Model.
In the full model for the total analysis 
sample ( 
Table 4), we found 1 
significant gender-interaction effect, 
indicating that only for girls (not 
for boys) having a higher-quality 
relationship with mothers was linked 
to a lower likelihood to initiate 
early sexual intercourse between 
T1 and T2 (odds ratio [OR] 0.66; 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50–
0.88, = P.01).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we assessed 
prospective associations between 
mother-adolescent and father-
adolescent relationship quality and 
early sexual intercourse initiation 
(ie, ≤16 years) among a large sample 
of Dutch adolescents. The results

of both bivariate and multivariate 
analyses showed that only for girls 
(not for boys) having a higher-
quality relationship with mothers 
was prospectively linked to a lower 
likelihood to initiate early sexual 
intercourse. Furthermore, bivariate 
findings showed that both girls and 
boys who reported a higher-quality 
relationship with their father at T1 
were significantly less likely to have 
engaged in early sexual intercourse 
between T1 and T2. However, 
when assessed multivariately, 
the associations between father-
adolescent relationship quality and 
early sexual initiation were no longer 
significant, neither for boys nor for 
girls. Overall, our results are partially 
in line with our hypotheses and 
consistent with previous studies. Yet 
our findings also expand the existing 
literature in several ways.
First, our finding that a higher-
quality relationship with mothers is a 
protective factor against early sexual 
initiation for girls, but not for boys, is 
in line with previous studies. 
19, 
 
30 
 
–
33 
This may be related to the fact 
that mothers are still the primary 
providers of sexuality education 
within families, and also that mothers 
talk more often about sexuality 
with daughters than with sons. 
48 
 
 
–
52 
According to social learning theory, 
 
53 
girls tend to learn more from and 
behave more according to their 
mothers’ role modeling, whereas 
boys tend to learn more from and 
behave more according to their 
fathers’ role modeling. 
53 
– 
55 Thus, 
having a high-quality relationship 
with mothers may contribute to more 
frequent parent-adolescent sexual 
communication, 
48 
– 
50 which in turn 
has been associated with a lower 
likelihood of early sexual intercourse 
initiation, particularly for girls. 
48, 
 
51 
Future studies should further 
examine the exact mechanisms 
underlying the protective effects 
of a high-quality relationship with 
mothers.

Second, although our bivariate 
findings suggested that a higher-
quality relationship with fathers 
may protect both girls and boys 
against early sexual initiation, 
the multivariate analysis results 
indicated no significant protective 
effect from fathers, neither for 
boys nor for girls. This finding 
differed from findings of previous 
studies. 
27, 
 
28 It may be that in our 
multivariate regression models, we 
have accounted for variables that 
have been consistently associated 
with adolescents’ sexual initiation, 
such as family structure, 
 
42 
–
44 and 
parental monitoring, 
 
45 
– 
47 which in 
turn may have reduced the unique 
predictive value of father-adolescent 
relationship quality. Also, our study 
included younger adolescents (ie, 
12–
15 years at T1 and 12–
16 years 
at T2) than previous studies, which 
included older adolescents (ie, 15–
19 
years, 
 
28 and 16–
19 years, 
27). This 
could suggest that fathers may be 
more influential on adolescents’ 
sexual initiation when their children 
are older, perhaps because they start 
communicating about sexuality after 
their children have already formed 
interest in sex. 
48 Finally, our different 
findings for fathers compared with 
American studies also may be related 
to specificities of Dutch society. 
25 
Dutch fathers spend, on average, half 
as much time with their children 
compared with Dutch mothers. 
26 In 
fact, of all Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development 
countries, Dutch fathers spend the 
least time with their children (except 
for Austria). 
56 As a consequence, 
Dutch fathers share relatively few 
activities with their children, 
56 
which also may contribute to their 
reduced influence on the timing of 
adolescents’ sexual initiation. More 
research is needed to investigate 
other possible mechanisms through 
which Dutch fathers may play a role 
in adolescents’ sexual development, 
above and beyond the quality of the 
relationship between adolescents 
and their fathers. Assessing the role 
of fathers’ participation in shared 
activities with their children, 
 
29, 
 
57 
fathers’ (dis)approval of their 
children engaging in sex, 
 
58 fathers’ 
behavioral control or autonomy 
stimulation, 
 
29 and the frequency of 
father-adolescent communication 
about sexuality, 
51 may be relevant 
directions for future research.
Overall, the current study contributes 
to the ample scientific evidence 
showing that a high-quality 
relationship between adolescents 
and their parents, especially between 
mothers and daughters, may help to 
protect against early sexual initiation. 
Furthermore, our findings are in 
line with socioecological theory 
17 
and family systems theory, 
 
59 which 
emphasize that various aspects 
of complex family environments, 
including the quality of parent-
adolescent relationships and parental 
monitoring, contribute to the timing 
of adolescents’ sexual initiation. 
More empirical research is needed to 
further advance our understanding of 
how different family relationships (ie, 
father-son, father-daughter, mother-
daughter, and mother-son dyads) 
29, 
 
60 
and other parenting practices (eg, 
levels of involvement, control, and 
sexual communication) interact with 
each other and influence adolescents’ 
sexual development.
Strengths and Limitations
The current study has several 
strengths, including the longitudinal 
design, which allowed us to assess 
prospective associations between 
parent-adolescent relationship 
quality and early sexual intercourse 
initiation. Another innovative 
aspect was that, whereas previous 
studies have focused exclusively on 
the role of mothers, 
 
19 
 
– 
22, 
48 we also 
investigated the role of fathers in 
early sexual intercourse initiation. 
Furthermore, whereas most studies 
that assessed the associations 
between parent-adolescent 
relationship quality and early sexual 
intercourse initiation have been 
conducted in United States, our study 
was conducted in the Netherlands, 
where adolescents are known 
for relatively better sexual health 
outcomes compared with other 
countries., 
 
48
However, a few limitations should be 
taken into account when interpreting 
the results. First, information on all 
variables was assessed by self-report 
questionnaires, which may have 
led to socially desirable answers. 
Second, nonresponse analyses 
showed significant differences

between adolescents included in 
the analysis sample and those who 
were excluded, with the latter being 
significantly older, enrolled in lower 
educational levels, living less often 
with both parents, reporting lower 
levels of parental monitoring, and 
reporting lower-quality relationships 
with their mothers and fathers. These 
differences allow one to infer that 
the effects of mother-adolescent and 
father-adolescent relationships on 
early sexual intercourse initiation 
may have been underestimated. 
Finally, the assessment of sexual 
intercourse as a single outcome may 
be a potential limitation of our study, 
because most Dutch adolescents 
(73.0%) follow a so-called 
progressive sexual trajectory, 
initiating different sexual behaviors 
in a stepwise manner: touching at 
Meanage = 15.1 years, manual sex 
at Meanage = 16.1 years, and sexual 
intercourse at Meanage = 16.6 years. 
31 
These other types of sexual activities 
may also carry potential health 
risks. Yet, assessing early sexual 
intercourse initiation is specifically 
relevant for our understanding of 
adolescents’ risky sexual behavior 
and healthy sexual development, 
because of its evidenced link with 
unprotected sex,

Clinical Implications
Notwithstanding the need for 
more research, the findings from 
the current study have relevant 
implications for pediatricians and 
other health care professionals. 
International guidelines published 
by the American Academy of 
Pediatrics 
61, 
 
62 describe the 
engagement in sexual behaviors 
as a normative aspect of the 
developmental stage of adolescence, 
and suggest that pediatricians and 
other health care professionals have 
a responsibility to help promote 
a healthy sexual development of 
adolescents. 
61, 
 
62 Hence, they should 
be able to explain to parents that 
early sexual intercourse initiation 
can be associated with negative 
health outcomes (eg, STIs, unwanted 
pregnancy), but that parents can 
play an important role in promoting 
healthy sexual behaviors.17 
Specifically, by cultivating a high-
quality relationship with their child, 
parents can contribute to create a 
healthy developmental environment 
that may help adolescents to develop 
responsible decision-making 
skills, 
 
29, 
 
63, 
 
64 which may positively 
affect their sexual behaviors, for 
instance regarding the right time 
to initiate sexual intercourse. 
29, 
63 
By increasing awareness about this 
topic, pediatricians and other health 
care professionals can help parents 
to promote healthy adolescent sexual 
development.
