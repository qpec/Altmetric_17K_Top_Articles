Abstract
Background: Although Primary care is crucial for suicide prevention, clinicians tend to report completed suicides in
their care as non-preventable. We aimed to examine systemic inadequacies in suicide prevention from the
perspectives of bereaved family members and GPs.
Methods: Qualitative study of 72 relatives or close friends bereaved by suicide and 19 General Practitioners who
have experienced the suicide of patients.
Results: Relatives highlight failures in detecting symptoms and behavioral changes and the inability of GPs to
understand the needs of patients and their social contexts. A perceived overreliance on anti-depressant treatment is
a major source of criticism by family members. GPs tend to lack confidence in the recognition and management of
suicidal patients, and report structural inadequacies in service provision.
Conclusions: Mental health and primary care services must find innovative and ethical ways to involve families in
the decision-making process for patients at risk of suicide.

Background
Most patients who die by suicide, have been in contact
with family doctors in the year prior to death [1–3]. Al-
though General Practitioners (GPs) in the UK routinely
ask depressed patients screening questions for suicidality
[4] many risk factors for suicide are highly prevalent
(e.g. depression) and therefore not usefully predictive.
Further, impulsivity noted in certain psychiatric disor-
ders and non-diagnosed individuals, has also been linked
to suicide and many patients with co-morbid alcohol
and substance misuse disorders are difficult to manage
[1]. Interventions for the detection, management and
outcome of depression and anxiety in primary care indi-
cate positive results for combined strategies of clinician
and patient education, nurse case management, shared
care with psychiatric services and medication although
only with short-term effects [5, 6]. Although various na-
tional strategies highlight the importance of primary care
in suicide prevention strategies [7, 8] the complexity of
recognition and management of suicidal patients by
GPs, is seldom acknowledged. Similarly, families are vital
in preventing suicide but their experiences in getting
and
providing
care
is
under-researched.
Suicide-
bereaved family members have an increased risk for de-
pression, often accompanied by feelings of guilt and
blame linked to a quest to understand why the suicide
happened [9, 10]. While GPs may be of help to bereaved
families, they may also be a source of recrimination
when perceived as having failed to prevent it. As part of
a multi-perspective programme of research on suicide
help-seeking [11] we sought to examine the barriers to
effective identification and management of suicidal pa-
tients in primary care from the perspectives of GPs and
bereaved family members.

 Method
Individual in-depth interviews with (a) relatives bereaved
by suicide: and (b) GPs who had experienced the death
of at least one patient through suicide.
Recruitment of sample
Family participants: People bereaved by suicide over a
24-month1 period were contacted through the Coroners
Office Northern Ireland (NI). Seventy-two family mem-
bers agreed to participate. Following written informed
consent, we undertook in-depth interviews with the help
of a topic guide that covered the circumstances of the sui-
cide event (e.g. life events, causal attributions), help-
seeking and service contacts prior to death. In the latter,
we explored difficulties in obtaining appropriate treatment
and support within primary care and other services.
GP
Participants:
The
GP
sample
was
recruited
through the Royal College of General Practitioners (NI).
GPs working in Northern Ireland who had experienced
the suicide of at least one patient in their care were invited
by the College to participate. We were unable to match
GPs with the bereaved family sample. Using a narrative
approach, we asked GPs to discuss patients who died by
suicide, within which we explored (1) contact, recognition
and management of suicidal patient; (2) primary care li-
aison with psychiatric and other services and (3) recom-
mendations for improved care and suicide prevention. We
requested that GPs avoid identifying characteristics.
Analysis
We entered the qualitative data gathered through in-
depth interviews with bereaved family members/friends
into Atlas-ti 7; a software programme for the management
and analysis of text data. The aims of this strand of the
study were to obtain a better understanding of help-
seeking in relation to the person who died by suicide and
then, to examine the impact of suicide on the people who
are bereaved by suicide, usually a close family member.
Subsidiary areas related to these broad questions included:
(a) an understanding of what families believed to have
provoked suicide and what might have prevented it; (b)
service provision to the deceased and also, the needs and
access to services among bereaved families. In undertaking
these qualitative interviews, we were not seeking to de-
velop a specific theory, usually associated with grounded
theory studies, [12] on help-seeking or the impact on be-
reaved relatives, but, rather, to offer a detailed, more ‘real-
ist’ picture of relatives’ understanding of the events and
experiences leading up to the suicide and a phenomeno-
logical grasp of what happens to individuals and their fam-
ilies in the aftermath of suicide. We recognise that this
knowledge is always limited and contingent. The partici-
pants can only offer a personal view of events, or at times,
assisted by the views and knowledge of others, as narrated
to them. Nevertheless, the participants must be accepted
as ‘close informants’ who knew the people who died by
suicide, often intimately. Adopting a realist stance, we
have not attempted to ‘interrogate’ their witnessing of the
suicide circumstances. Nevertheless, where these emerge,
we have sought to show the inconsistencies and paradoxes
in the data. Importantly, we have attempted a systematic
and comprehensive depiction of the experiences, issues
and processes as presented by families without overlaying
these accounts with too much intrusive interpretation.
As part of the analytical process, different members of
the team examined copies of the first 10 interviews and
then met to develop a coding structure, which at first,
loosely followed the topic guide in terms of the overall
areas of interest and then proceeded to a more detailed
thematic analysis of these areas. The codes (and coding
frame) were revised at various stages throughout the
indexing stage by the team, usually when ambiguities
emerged. The 764 codes initially generated from reading
and re-reading the interviews were systematized in con-
ceptually clustered matrices [13] as a ‘strategy for con-
ducting thematic analysis to order and synthesise data’
[14]. Wherever possible and without losing all meaning
in the transcripts, we have completely removed all iden-
tifying characteristics of the people who died and the
participants who provided these accounts. The data are
mainly presented in a thematic analysis and therefore
may be prone to a degree of fragmentation or discon-
nection between beliefs, attitudes, events and experi-
ences, in which the ‘full narratives’ appear to get lost.
Results
Sample
Close informants: 72 women and men closely con-
nected to the person who died. The participants lived in
a spread of urban and rural areas. The informants age-
bands and relationship to the deceased are given in
Table 1. Sociodemographic details of the deceased have
not been published to secure anonymity.
General Practitioners: 11 women and 8 men, from a
diverse range of primary care settings, (socio-economic
and urban, semi-urban and rural populations). The par-
ticipants were all long-serving practitioners, between 15
and 30 years’ experience. Each had been involved in the
care of more than 2 people who died by suicide, with
several GPs indicating more than 10 cases.2
Family perspectives on primary care
In the first section, we highlight the positive aspects
of primary care. The main section covers the barriers
to effective care and suicide prevention. The themes
relate to recognition, management and poor continu-
ity of care (Table 2).

 Compassionate care
Relatives were satisfied with GPs who showed a humane
as well as a professional interest in the suicidal patient,
maintained contact, discussed treatment options, were
flexible and communicated with relatives. They also
made domiciliary visits if requested.
Consultations with the same GP reassured relatives
that ‘nothing was being missed’
, which, in turn, patients’
and families’ trust. Such GPs were perceived to be more
aware of the patient’s and family needs, and their specific
contexts and environments. They were considered to
‘have done their best’ to prevent the suicide:
The GP was quite proactive. He had a good
relationship with the GP and actually spoke at length
with the GP, yeah, because he had the same GP
throughout and he would have spoken quite highly of
his GP (P71, Wife).
She really thought a lot of him [the GP]. He was
actually the GP that came down the night that she
had to go to the hospital to get her stomach pumped
and he knew the build up to it and knew her
circumstances and knew everything. … Possibly she
had told Dr. [name of doctor] the whole story and he
knew what was happening. So, he maybe tried to keep
the husband at a distance (P15, Sister).
In this last quote, we get an indication of the fine balance
that GPs are obliged to preserve; keeping family members
involved (some of whom may have contributed to the pa-
tient’s problems) while securing patient confidentiality.
GP recognition
Patient concealment
Participants, generally, acknowledged that the GP’s assess-
ment of risk is grounded in the patient’s communication
of emotions and intentions. In many cases, families de-
scribed their relative’s refusal to ‘open up’. Consequently,
some families accompanied the patient to the surgery but
were then thwarted by the patient’s denials of depression
or suicidality. These ‘contests’
, between the patient and
other family members sometimes provoked inter-family
frustration and resentment. Various participants reported
difficulties in discussing depression with GPs or how

 doctors misinterpret, or possibly ignore, patient communi-
cation. In other cases, GPs failed to recognise the signifi-
cance of an unusual visit by a depressed patient. Failure of
GP suicide risk assessment was common among patients
living with chronic pain. In the following quote, a daughter
attributes her father’s suicide to unmanaged arthritic pain:
I think it was only about two weeks before he died he
had to go back to the doctor for his pain relief and he
really needed them upped but the doctor gave him his
usual prescription, and he had mentioned being quite
down about it all. The doctor had … because my
mum always went with him, and the doctor had said,
‘Well, are you so depressed (that you might) harm
yourself?’ And my daddy just shrugged his shoulders.
But then the doctor said, ‘Well, there's your pain relief
and make another appointment and we’ll deal with
your depression.’ So, to me, if somebody shrugs that
should be enough. That doesn’t mean, ‘No, I’m fine.’
(P12, Daughter).
Others asserted that GPs missed the signs of depression
expressed in frequent contact with the surgery.
To me, the doctor should have noticed it. She was in
the doctor’s maybe twice a day. […] She was
neglected, pure neglect, wasn’t given the appropriate
treatment or assessed right or anything, and I do
blame the GP. (P49, Sister).
Brief consultations: “The ten-minute rule”
In many narratives, families complained that GPs missed
suicidality because of a busy appointments schedule, an
argument that recurs in the GP interviews. Limited time
was thus regarded as a key barrier to securing patient
trust, communication about mental illness and suicide
risk assessment:
Doctors are ten minutes and you’re out and it’s not
easy for anybody to go, there's always the stigma of
mental health problems … (P37, Father).
Antidepressants and limited treatment options
Anti-depressant medication and limited alternative treat-
ment options, was a major source of dissatisfaction. In
several cases, patients stopped taking medication be-
cause they feared addiction or experienced side-effects,
e.g. lethargy, erectile dysfunction. The term ‘reluctant’
was commonly used, often expressed as ‘common know-
ledge’ by the suicidal person that antidepressants are in-
effective, or took too long to ‘work’.
He didn’t like taking them so he stopped taking them
for whatever reason. He should have been taking
them maybe. There’s a lot of people don't like taking
them because they think, ‘I’m hooked on these things
now forever’ (P8, Friend).
In other cases, patients rejected medication because it
conflicted with their explanatory model of the problem.
For example, as reported by a family member, one pa-
tient with post-natal depression felt that her problems
were related to her “marriage and no matter how much
medication she took it wasn’t going to help her”. She
was given anti-depressants but didn’t take them.
A recurrent complaint was that GPs were over-reliant
on medication and took little account of patient reluc-
tance and family concerns
I wanted an appointment to see the doctor and asked
the receptionist, I said, ‘I’m here about my husband.
Could you give me an appointment?’ ‘No need,’ she
said ‘at all, there’s another prescription.’ […] My
husband was given different types of … sleeping
tablets, tranquilizers. I said, ‘What do I do with the
rest of them? He’ll not take them; that is why I want to
see the doctor. He thinks I’m drugging him.’ […] I was
at the end of my tether. (P58, Wife).
Failure to review
A lack of effective monitoring added to the perceptions
by relatives that patients were ‘being fed’ medication, as
one person expressed it. The family’s inability to monitor
medication is also noted.
The only treatment … he was on anti-depressants;
[…] and what we didn’t know, he had opted to stop
taking them without medical advice. How long he had
stopped taking them, I’m not aware even at this stage.
I presume it would probably … it could be months, it
could be a year, I don't know. But he had elected him-
self to stop taking them (P19, Brother).
General practitioners perspectives
The key thematic areas identified by GPs in describing
barriers to suicide prevention are as follows: (1) Recog-
nition and management of suicidal people; (2) Liaison
and communication with Mental Health Services; (3)
Dealing with bereaved families; (4) Professional and per-
sonal impact of patient suicide.
Recognition and management
No contact
GPs noted that suicides on their register, predominantly
men, had seldom or never made any contact. Others,
known to the GP as having a history of psychiatric prob-
lems, had quit the area and didn’t re-register elsewhere.
Leavey et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:369 
Page 4 of 10
 When patients don’t contact or attend appointments,
the default assumption among GPs is that they are well.
Stigma
GPs substantiated the relatives’ narratives as to the de-
terrent strength of stigma about seeking help for mental
illness; especially in their accounts of suicide among
men from small and rural communities where for cul-
tural and professional reasons, the shame of mental ill-
ness is profound.
Out in farming communities in particular, people are
very … they pride themselves in being very robust,
and men in particular don't seek help unless it’s
something quite seriously wrong with them, be it on a
physical level, and often you don't see people who are
farmers with mental problems unless they are brought
in by other relatives. … It would be seen as unmanly
(…) if you have to come in and tell the doctor that
you’re depressed or you’re not coping or whatever.
(GP1)
Assessing risk
GPs acknowledged the lack training or confidence in
dealing with psychiatric disorders. With severe and en-
during mental illness, psychosis for example, GPs felt
safer referring to secondary care. With common mental
disorders and suicidality, recognition and management is
unclear. Thus, many of the GPs in deprived, inner-city
areas contend with problems of drug abuse and gang
violence. Some report feeling overwhelmed by the de-
mand for sick notes and psychiatric medication, accord-
ing to some, often illegitimately. One GP described
being confronted by patients who “demanded diazepam
or they would kill themselves.”
A lot of people sick, mentally ill, and a lot of people
pretending to be mentally ill to get disability living
allowance. (GP9)
GP scepticism
It was commonly argued that general practice is cur-
rently dominated by a concern for suicide rather than
mental illness. One view is that many people who con-
tact the GP stating suicidality, are unlikely to be so. The
suicidal declaration is regarded as a recently emerging
form of presentation, in which the patient, because of
current adverse events or circumstances, is finding life
very difficult; interpreted by some, as a strategy to rouse
medical care or secure disability allowance. In the next
quote, the GP indicates something of a cultural response
to personal problems.
I suppose the problem is that the people who come in
saying they’re suicidal are then, I suppose, taking up
work … they take up quite a considerable amount of
work, and there are one particular family going
through here at the minute who have had three or
four people from the same family, girls perhaps one
or two years older than each other, presenting with
the same suicidal ideation over the last few weeks,
which takes up a considerable amount of time for
CPNs. So the lag then that you see is people who
perhaps aren’t perceived as being suicidal but have
acute mental health problems that probably need
dealing with but the system’s stretched trying to deal
with people that are presenting with these crises
situations. (GP14)
Nevertheless, we also noted that although GPs suggest a
degree of awareness that the patient may have other
anxieties, these remain unexplored.
Risk assessment process
GPs are now required to screen for potential suicidality
using standard questions, which, commonly, are consid-
ered to be counterproductive and provoke defensiveness
among patients. One GP mentioned patients “bristling”
or getting upset; asking, “Do you think I’m mad!”. Typic-
ally, GPs find the suicide protocol as a barrier to thera-
peutic engagement or more suited to GPs who are not
confident, commenting that they find “more sensitive”
ways of determining suicidal thoughts among patients.
You have to ask them about their alcohol and their
social history and their debt and their family support,
and stuff you did anyway but never actually ticked
boxes, especially if you actually print it out and sit in
front of the patient and do it, that totally
depersonalises somebody, because “why does the
doctor want to know how much I earn or whether
I’ve got any credit card debt?” (GP3)
The ten-minute rule
“I think that we need more time with patients. The
demand is the problem, accident and emergency is on
its knees. It is not a problem about GPs, it is a
problem of impossible demand.”
As noted previously, the stigma of mental illness and pa-
tient reticence to discuss ‘personal’ problems often in-
hibits any meaningful intervention by GPs. Patients
often require gentle encouragement to disclose their
troubles. The issue of limited time was universally noted
as a barrier to the recognition and management of any
underlying mental health or emotional problems.
Leavey et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:369 
Page 5 of 10
 Personally, I … if somebody needs to talk, they need
to talk and the waiting time goes out the window, and
my patients tend to know that and my reception staff
are very good at saying ‘she’s running a bit behind
today’. (GP5)
Few GPs were as relaxed about the 10-min rule as the
GP above. Patients often begin to discuss the ‘true’ pre-
senting problem as their 10 min come to an end, leaving
the GP with difficult choices to make. In the following
quote, the participant relates that counselling, an im-
portant GP skill is being eroded by work overload and
bureaucratisation. From this perspective, GPs decreas-
ingly provide the humane and compassionate aspects of
primary care.
My job is changing, that little bit of counselling I do
as I go through my job, there’s not time for it
anymore. I have to pass that onto somebody else. It’s
a bit of a struggle to state some of the things I do
well, there's not time for this anymore; that's
becoming someone’s else’s job, whether my patients
want it to be or not or whether I want it to be or not.
I can't keep doing my job and stay sane and do all of
this anymore because there's just not time. (GP8)
Suicide as unpredictable
He wasn't on drugs, he didn't drink, he had friends,
he hadn’t had a relationship bust up; there was
nothing that you could point other than his cousin
did it. (GP5)
The unpredictability of suicide was a repeated issue. In
the above quote, the GP reflects that this young man’s
suicide was emulative. GPs remarked on the heterogen-
eity of the suicide, in terms of the patient characteristics,
social contexts and presenting problems. The unpredict-
ability may arise in various ways. For example, through
somatic
presentations
or
when
patients
may
have
attended surgery for some time but show no indication
that they may be depressed or suicidal. Such consulta-
tions are often for physical problems, common among
older patients, some of who have been managing
chronic, complex conditions. Such patients are highly
regarded for their long-term stoicism, presenting a
‘cheery front’ and then leaving doctors “quite taken
aback” when suicide occurs.
No, he never ever presented with any psychiatric
illness. Even in the bad times when there were
assassinations going on and all sorts of things where
he really was at risk, he never sought any help with
anxiety, depression, nothing. (…) So I knew him
reasonably well and he didn’t use drugs, he took a
drink but not to excess. He was not predictable; I
could never have spotted him for suicide, no way.
(GP3)
In other cases, the presenting problems seemed minor
or non-existent.
The day I saw him, for example, he was more
concerned about how he looked rather than basically
… and I sort of said what is actually bothering you
and he said the spots on his face. He didn't sort of
have any … it didn't seem to be a body image
problem and we did explore other sort of symptoms. I
did ask about sleep, appetite and his general
enjoyment of things, and he certainly didn’t seem
unkempt or anything like that. He seemed a typical
sort of young person. (GP12)
Paradoxical presentation
Patients who have been treated for depression may
complete suicide in the midst of ostensibly positive signs
and outcomes. Thus, they appear to be responding well
to treatment, returning to work, engaging with commu-
nity. In the following case, the patient met the GP and
reported that her “life was on-track”; she had a new job
and a new house.
She said, “Doctor, everything is fine…and then, two
days later, the police walked in; she had been on the
booze and hanged herself. What do you do about
that?”
Continuity of care and poor engagement
In various narratives, suicides happen despite an appar-
ent high level of attention by services, both statutory
and voluntary. In one case, a young man had a difficult
existence that included family breakup, a previous sui-
cide attempt aged 14 years, unemployment and sub-
stance misuse. His history of poor engagement with
mental health services echoes other interviews.
Two or three months prior to his suicide he consulted
with a couple of the different doctors and we changed
his anti-depressants and we’d brought him back for
review. He didn't keep the review dates and when he
did come in it was about some other health problem.
He denied any self-harm and he denied any sort of
suicidal tendencies. He did display some anger man-
agement problems, which we’d referred him to men-
to -men project and also to a counsellor. He had been
seen also by (a voluntary sector organization) and
then prior to his committing suicide he actually had
been seen in A&E but we didn’t get the letter until
Leavey et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:369 
Page 6 of 10
 after his demise. So, he’d actually been seen by Crisis
Response Team. (GP12)
The problem of poor engagement noted by this GP was
balanced against the issue of continuity of care. She re-
ported that the patient was somewhat manipulative and
had deliberately sought the assistance of different GPs
and had been offered a range of support. In other cases,
continuity of care was influenced by family behavior,
often driven by stigma. For example, in one case, the GP
reported that the family had “protected” their son for a
considerable time before seeking treatment. When they
did so, they also tried to obtain care from private health-
care (described as a “disaster”). Moreover, the family
neglected to convey to the GP, various indicators of sui-
cidal intent; revealed only after his death.
Alcohol and drug use
GPs describe the lives of various suicide patients as cha-
otic and in which alcohol plays a significant role, either as
self-medication when depression hits or as a precursor
factor in the loss of job, family and contact with the crim-
inal justice system. The presence of alcohol is regarded as
obscuring diagnosis and hindering treatment.
There’s been a few who are almost regulars where you
just don’t know are they really suicidal or is it a cry
for help, and there's been a few repeated ones would
take overdoses who we’re all aware of, or maybe the
odd cut wrist and stuff, but more tentative wounds.
But mostly overdoses, quite often tied in with drugs,
or alcohol particularly (GP15)
Psychiatric services
GPs’ relationships with mental health services were vari-
able, shifting from complementary and highly satisfied
to the fractious and disturbing. The variance was partly
determined by locale and the structural organization of
psychiatric services. Although some GPs had good rela-
tionships with local mental health services, particularly
crisis intervention and home treatment teams, they de-
scribed substantial gaps within the community care of
people with severe depressive disorders. Additionally, ac-
knowledging that many suicides appear unpreventable,
they point to instances when suicide should not have
been the outcome. In brief however, the dominant issues
documented by GPs regarding mental health services re-
late to the following: (1) Perceived inadequate assess-
ment; (2) Delays to hospitalization; (3) Inadequate or
absent follow-up in the community; (4) Lack of commu-
nication with primary care; (5) Absence of shared know-
ledge and expertise..3
Inadequate response
There was a strong perception that psychiatrists are
sceptical of the GP’s professional judgment or at least, a
tendency to minimize the GP’s assessment of the ur-
gency of the problem. One GP felt that the structure of
a ‘One-point referral’ system was unhelpful. In other in-
stances,
GPs
believed
that
patients
were
sketchily
assessed and then discharged with minimal safeguarding.
In the following case, the GP felt that sufficient warning
signs had been raised but that the assessment arrange-
ment had been “dragging on for days”. She argued with
psychiatry that she knew the patient very well, much
better than mental health services.
I was very upset because I felt that if he had been
sectioned, he would have been alive and we could
have worked through the issues he had. (GP1)
Providing a psychiatric assessment via the telephone was
problematic when the patient was present in the surgery
but wanting to leave. In some cases, the GPs could not
convince the clinician on the other end of the phone
that the patient required admission. In other cases, dif-
fering clinical judgments are made about the patient’s
mental state and the assessment of risk. In one case, a
female
patient
experienced
an
alarming
personality
change. Just over 65 years, the patient fell between adult
mental health and old age psychiatry. Clinicians dis-
agreed as to her mental state and capacity. The patient
took her own life in the midst of clinical wrangling.
Other suicides may happen because psychiatric services
were stretched too thinly.
After his discharge from hospital into the care of the
home treatment team, he was due to have daily
reviews (…). The day after his discharge, they (home
treatment team) reviewed by home and decided with
him that they didn’t need to see him the next day. So,
the first contact with (services) was to downgrade his
review and the next day he killed himself. (GP13)
The same GP argued that psychiatric services tend to neg-
lect people who are depressed, concentrating on severe
and enduring disorders instead. In several cases, con-
cerned about their deterioration, he referred patients with
a severe depression to psychiatric services, only to be told,
“we don’t think this is our problem, could you send the
patient to some of the voluntary services”. He stated that
it was not reasonable for a GP to undertake outreach for
people with severe depression and who may be suicidal.
Communication and liaison with psychiatry
GPs complained of attempting, desperately on many oc-
casions, to convince the psychiatric gatekeepers of the

 need for an emergency referral.4 In other instances,
some patients were described as being at increased risk
because of transitional boundaries. For example, young
people who having been seen in Child and Adolescent
Mental Health Services (CAMHS) but were not trans-
ferred into adult care. When connections and relation-
ships dissolved in these structures, so too did the
continuity of care and some GPs felt that some people
might still be alive today had these barriers to communi-
cation and referral not existed.
The organisation of mental health services in some
Health & Social Care Trusts had undergone considerable
change leading to a fragmentation of psychiatric services
into different specialist sectors (for example, recovery,
addiction, emergency).
They would overlap and you’d have the difficulties of
getting the right person; people would get lost
between the cracks. But the actual individual, when
you got them, was super. I felt that there was a loss of
continuity. The GP is the only person, really, that had
any picture of continuity. (GP6)
Thus, the functional split within psychiatric services re-
moved a valued, direct and personal connection between
primary care and psychiatrists, through which advice or
concern about a patient’s mental state could be quickly re-
solved by a phone call. Once removed, GPs felt that men-
tal health services may not be operating in the best
interests of the GP or the patient. The suspicion that men-
tal health services are “off-loading” was noted elsewhere.
There is some concern that the voluntary sector is ex-
pected to fill in the gaps but this is becomes part of a ‘re-
volving door’ scenario. There were various views about the
value of voluntary sector provision of psychological ther-
apies but most found it hard to comment, simply because
communication between primary care and the sector was
minimal with no feedback about patients referred. The
disjunction between primary care and mental health ser-
vices had deeper implications and GPs wanted the devel-
opment of closer liaison and knowledge sharing.
Greater co-operation between the services, at present
I have no contact with the psychiatric services at all.
There is no personal contact, it would really help if
we had more regular meeting or case discussions with
them that would be a learning opportunity for us; we
might be able to fill them in on some of the pressures.
Probably a greater appreciation for each other’s roles
and what we can do. (GP14)
Discussion
Contact with primary care services prior to suicide is
common, leaving opportunities for intervention [3, 15].
In previous work from this study we found that most
primary care contacts were related to mental health
problems, increasing over time [16]. The likelihood of
contact was increased among women, older people and
among people with substance misuse problems and
common mental disorders [16]. The prevention of sui-
cide often depends on a delicate collaboration between
multiple agents and agencies in which availability and
timing, knowledge and communication, relationships
and trust, all contribute. Certainly, prevention is not
clear cut [17] In common with other research in this
area we found considerable and complex challenges to
engagement with the health care system, some struc-
tural, others cultural [18, 19].
In this paper we sought to explore these relationships
from the perspectives of families and general practi-
tioners. Families, while not universally reproachful of
health services, raise important concerns about the rec-
ognition and management of suicidal risk in patients.
Other evidence from the UK indicates that a high pro-
portion of patients take their own lives within a month
of discharge from services, suggesting a poor follow-up
and engagement with the families into whose care they
are often left [20]. The brevity of the GP consultation
was regarded as the foremost barrier to recognition and
treatment of mental illness. Bearing in mind that the
stigma of mental illness in many cases had consistently
delayed any contact with services, families were espe-
cially distraught when, despite their efforts to get help,
GP’s appeared to accept the patient’s misleading presen-
tation of the problem. In such cases, suicides sometimes
occurred shortly after contact or in the midst of being
treated for other chronic, physical health conditions.
General
practitioners
provided
an
alternative
but
sometimes, complimentary perspective, to that of the
family participants. Theirs was a complicated and uncer-
tain position in suicide prevention in primary care, as it
was regarded commonly as unpredictable. Thus, even
when individuals are diagnosed and treated appropri-
ately, suicide still happens. Nevertheless, in line with evi-
dence from the USA and elsewhere, [21]. GPs also
acknowledged, that some suicides may have been pre-
ventable, ‘failures’ regarded either as limited personal
competency or a systemic failure, the result of poor li-
aison and decision-making. We found widespread agree-
ment that GPs are ill prepared and ill equipped in the
management of mental illness, compounded by the pres-
sure of patient waiting rooms and waiting lists [22]. In
views that chimed with those of relatives, high levels of
demand ensures that people with complex psycho-social
needs are afforded only superficial opportunity to articu-
late their problems. Given that some GPs feel that ‘pro-
forma’ questions about an individual’s suicidal ideas and
behaviours undermine patient trust and engagement,
Leavey et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:369 
Page 8 of 10
 there is a need for research on how best to support GPs
in screening for suicidality in ways that don’t comprom-
ise patient trust.
The pressure of time and low confidence in mental
health care, appears to push GPs into an overreliance on
pharmacological treatment, leaving little space for pa-
tient preference or extended discussions with patients
about the benefits of such treatments. While, some GPs
presented the notion of patient-GP partnership, a psy-
chological contract with obligations and responsibilities
on both sides, the dominant approach, albeit for prag-
matic reasons, appears to be, ‘take it or leave it’. As
noted in the participant interviews, many of those who
died by suicide were dissatisfied with their medication
and simply stopped using it. This and many other issues
raised by families, run contrary to current NHS clinical
guidelines [23] for patient-centred care, communication
and self-management. Moreover, evidence suggests that
outpatient contact, rather than hospitalisation, and psy-
chotherapy or other brief psychological treatments may
be effective for patients following a suicide attempt or
high risk of repeat self-injury [24].
Systemic failures refer predominantly to communica-
tion breakdown between primary care and psychiatry.
These arise from the split between the traditional ap-
proach, that is, a sectorised model and the functional
split model [25]. In the former, a single consultant pro-
vides both hospital and community care within a desig-
nated geographical catchment area. In the functional
split model, various other specialist teams are established
such as recovery, crisis resolution and home treatment
teams. Where this model has been adopted, consultant
psychiatrists are no longer responsible for patients
across the range of treatment settings. For many GPs,
this lack of a central contact is a challenge to GP care of
people with mental illness, on a range of levels and is-
sues. Social capital in the form of knowledge-sharing,
advice and trust-building, is quick to disappear.
Conclusions
Our study provides first-hand accounts of the difficulties
of managing suicidal patients within primary care ser-
vices. While some completed suicide events can appear
spontaneous or impulsive, suggesting that they were un-
avoidable, there may be considerable failures to detect
individuals at risk. Fragmentation of care is poor and in-
efficient care. The costs to society and families are con-
siderable. We know that GPs lack training in mental
disorders and therefore it is imperative that we find in-
novative ways of integrating mental health services
within primary care settings, perhaps funding for mental
health nurse specialists within practice or regular mental
health clinics led by psychiatric teams. The failure of ser-
vices to prevent suicide is heightened by an inability to
engage families in a much more constructive and helpful
partnership. Communication and liaison between psy-
chiatric services, primary care and families requires bet-
ter is currently poor and E-technology has the potential
to monitor change and deterioration in mental states
and to rapidly transfer these data easily between care-
givers and services. Lastly, too often psychiatric and
medical services deny families the knowledge they need
to provide support and care; they do so on the grounds
of patient confidentiality. While this is sacrosanct, these
can be set aside where a life is at risk. Physicians can
and should be better informed on these issues.
Endnotes
11st March 2007-28th February 2009
2Within the interviews, three doctors acknowledged a
personal connection with suicides outside their profes-
sional role. These deaths are likely to have influenced
such doctors’ views on suicide and their professional en-
gagement with suicidal people.
3Other, perhaps more minor points that were men-
tioned in the interviews relate to concerns about the
long waiting lists and the refusal of mental health assess-
ment teams to see people who are intoxicated or have
taken drugs.
4The issue of alcohol use by patients was mentioned
as a barrier to emergency referral. Again, given the asso-
ciation between alcohol use and suicidal behaviour, the
rejection of such people by emergency services seems to
be contrary to suicide prevention.
