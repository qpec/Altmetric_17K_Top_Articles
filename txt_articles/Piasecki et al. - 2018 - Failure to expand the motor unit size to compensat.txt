Key points
r The age-related loss of muscle mass is related to the loss of innervating motor neurons and
denervation of muscle fibres.
r Not all denervated muscle fibres are degraded; some may be reinnervated by an adjacent
surviving neuron, which expands the innervating motor unit proportional to the numbers of
fibres rescued.
r Enlarged motor units have larger motor unit potentials when measured using electro-
physiological techniques.
r We recorded much larger motor unit potentials in relatively healthy older men compared to
young men, but the older men with the smallest muscles (sarcopenia) had smaller motor unit
potentials than healthy older men.
r These findings suggest that healthy older men reinnervate large numbers of muscle fibres to
compensate for declining motor neuron numbers, but a failure to do so contributes to muscle
loss in sarcopenic men.
Abstract Sarcopenia results from the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and reduced
function in older age. It is likely to be associated with the well-documented reduction of motor
unit numbers innervating limb muscles and the increase in size of surviving motor units via
reinnervation of denervated fibres. However, no evidence exists to confirm the extent of motor
unit remodelling in sarcopenic individuals. The aim of the present study was to compare motor

and applied methods to investigate the structure and function of human motor units. This is currently applied

unit size and number between young (n = 48), non-sarcopenic old (n = 13), pre-sarcopenic
(n = 53) and sarcopenic (n = 29) men. Motor unit potentials (MUPs) were isolated from
intramuscular and surface EMG recordings. The motor unit numbers were reduced in all groups
of old compared with young men (all P < 0.001). MUPs were higher in non-sarcopenic and
pre-sarcopenic men compared with young men (P = 0.039 and 0.001 respectively), but not in
the vastus lateralis of sarcopenic old (P = 0.485). The results suggest that extensive motor unit
remodelling occurs relatively early during ageing, exceeds the loss of muscle mass and precedes
sarcopenia. Reinnervation of denervated muscle fibres probably expands the motor unit size in
the non-sarcopenic and pre-sarcopenic old, but not in the sarcopenic old. These findings suggest
that a failure to expand the motor unit size distinguishes sarcopenic from pre-sarcopenic muscles.

Introduction
Low skeletal muscle mass and function in old age, known
as sarcopenia, is widely recognised as a serious and
independent condition of ageing (Cao & Morley, 2016).
An estimated 10–20% of people aged over 65 years have
sarcopenia, which is projected to equate to 20–30 million
Europeans by 2045 (Ethgen et al. 2017).
The progressive loss of muscle mass with increasing age
is due to both atrophy and loss of muscle fibres (Lexell et al.
1988). Fibre atrophy can be overcome, at least in part, by
physical rehabilitation (Doherty, 2003; Brook et al. 2016)
and pharmaceutical interventions (Dennison et al. 2017)
but these treatments do nothing to recover lost fibres.
These age-related changes affecting skeletal muscles are
likely to be related to declining numbers of motor units
(Piasecki et al. 2015). A motor unit includes a single alpha
motor neuron and all of the muscle fibres it innervates.
Anatomical counts estimate 35,000 motor neurons of the
upper limbs (Gesslbauer et al. 2017) and around 60,000
of the lower limbs (Tomlinson & Irving, 1977), with
each innervating hundreds or thousands of muscle fibres
(Feinstein et al. 1955; Gath & St˚
alberg, 1981). If a motor
neuron is impaired or degraded during ageing, its muscle
fibres may lose their innervation and will be vulnerable to
apoptosis.
Early indications that motor unit numbers decline with
increasing age in humans came from direct counts of
neuron cell bodies in the anterior horn of the spinal cord
in autopsy samples (Kawamura et al. 1977; Tomlinson &
Irving, 1977). At around the same time, in vivo EMG
techniques also revealed decreasing numbers of motor
units in a small foot muscle with increasing age (McComas
et al. 1971). This has since been confirmed for other limb
muscles using modern enhanced decomposition EMG
techniques (for reviews see Gooch et al. 2014; Piasecki
et al. 2015).
The available evidence not only points towards fewer,
but also larger motor units in older adults compared with
young (Stalberg & Fawcett, 1982; McNeil et al. 2005; Power
et al. 2012; Hourigan et al. 2015; Piasecki et al. 2016a,b).
Larger motor units are thought to result from branching of
nearby motor neurons to reinnervate recently denervated
muscle fibres (Luff, 1998; Deschenes, 2011; Hepple & Rice,
2016). In this case, the relative success of reinnervation
processes would be expected to determine the extent of
muscle atrophy and the progression of sarcopenia.
Despite considerable interest, surprisingly little is
known about how motor unit remodelling associates
with sarcopenia. Most previous studies did not assess the
sarcopenia status of participants, or they included small
sample sizes and examined the tibialis anterior, which
is relatively well preserved with ageing compared with
larger quadriceps muscles (Abe et al. 2011; Pannerec et al.
2016). Other studies used surface EMG decomposition
techniques (Kaya et al. 2013; Drey et al. 2014), which only
sample from the superficial parts of muscles (Muceli et al.
2015) and reveal nothing about the size of surviving motor
units.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to
compare motor unit size and number between young,
non-sarcopenic, pre-sarcopenic and sarcopenic men using
intramuscular EMG. We hypothesised that (a) there
would be a graded decline in motor unit numbers from
young through to healthy older men, pre-sarcopenic
and sarcopenic men (i.e. loss of muscle mass would be
proportional to the loss of motor units); and (b) there
would be a progressive increase in motor unit size from
young through to non-sarcopenic, pre-sarcopenic and
sarcopenic men.

Anthropometry
Body weight (kg) and height (m) were measured and BMI
was calculated as weight/height2.
Muscle cross sectional area (CSA) and the thickness
measured as distance from the superficial to the deep
aponeurosis of the quadriceps (QCSA), vastus lateralis
(VL)andtibialisanterior(TA)weremeasuredbymagnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) using a T1-weighted turbo
three-dimensional sequence on a 0.25-T G-Scan imager
(Esaote, Genoe, Italy). The scanning coil was positioned
over the motor point of the VL and, in separate scans,
of the TA. Contiguous 6 mm thick transverse-plane slices
were collected along a 14 cm length with the participant
lying rested and supine. Osirix imaging software (OsiriX
medical imaging, OsiriX, Atlanta, GA, USA) was used
offline to measure the CSA of images by tracing around the
quadricepsmuscles,andseparatelytheVLmuscleforthigh
scans, or the TA muscle for lower limb scans following the
contour of the aponeurosis. The slice with the highest CSA
was recorded as peak CSA (Maden-Wilkinson et al. 2014).
In 14 of the participants (9% of the total sample), MRI
was not used due to the presence of medical implants,
such as cardiac pacemakers. In these cases, ultrasound
was used to measure the muscle thickness and the CSA
was then estimated from the regression equation of the
very strong linear relationship between muscle thickness
and muscle CSA in participants from this study (Pearson
product-moment correlation was r = 0.917).
Total body composition was assessed by dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Lunar Prodigy Advance,
version EnCore 10.50.086, GE Healthcare, Madison, WI,
USA) with the participant lying supine with legs and
arms fully extended and wearing light cotton clothing.
Appendicular lean mass (ALM) excluding the bone
mineral content (Goodpaster et al. 2006) was measured
as the sum of the lean mass of arms and legs combined
using standard regions of interest to determine arms and
legs as previously reported (McPhee et al. 2013).
EMG setup
The motor points of VL (proximal) and TA were identified
by low-intensity percutaneous electrical stimulations as
previously described (Piasecki et al. 2016a,b). For VL, the
motor point was located along the centre line of the muscle
around 220 mm from the lateral femoral condyle. The TA
motor point was located approximately 120 mm from the
tibial head, over the muscle belly (Bowden & McNulty,
2012). The skin directly overlying the motor points was
prepared by shaving away any hair and then cleansing with
an alcohol swab.
The active surface EMG (sEMG) recording electrode
(disposable self-adhering Ag-AgCl electrodes; 95 mm2,
AmbuNeuroline,Baltorpbakken,Ballerup,Denmark)was
placed over the motor point. The reference electrode
was placed over the patella tendon for both muscles.
Intramuscular EMG (iEMG) signals were recorded using
disposable concentric needle electrodes (Model N53153;
Teca, Hawthorne, NY, USA). A common ground electrode
was used for sEMG and iEMG signals, which was placed
over the patella for both muscles. The sEMG and iEMG
signals were bandpass filtered at 5 Hz to 5 kHz and
at 10 Hz to 10 kHz, respectively, using two CED 1902
amplifiers (Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge,
UK).AllsignalsweredigitizedwithaCEDMicro1401data
acquisitionunit(CambridgeElectronicDesign).Sampling
rates were 10 kHz for sEMG and 25 kHz for iEMG.
Both EMG signals and the force signal were recorded

and displayed in real-time using Spike2 software (v8.01,
Cambridge Electronics Design).
Experimental procedures
Toassessthekneeextensormaximalvoluntarycontraction
force (MVC), the participant’s right leg was fastened to the
force transducer 30 cm below the centre of the knee joint,
with hip and knees flexed at 90°. For ankle dorsiflexion,
participants sat with hips flexed at approximately 60° and
both legs fully extended. The right foot was strapped
to the force transducer with the ankle at 80° (Jones
et al. 2009). Before testing MVC, participants performed
a standardised warm up of several contractions, after
which they were asked to perform a maximal effort lasting
approximately3swithreal-timevisualfeedbackandverbal
encouragement provided. This was repeated twice more
with short rest intervals between efforts. The highest of the
three values was accepted as the MVC. In all cases, the knee
extensors were first tested and participants then rested for
a minimum of 10 min before the ankle dorsiflexors were
tested.
In the VL, the maximal compound muscle action
potential
(CMAP)
was
obtained
via
percutaneous
stimulation of the femoral nerve. The cathode was placed
over the skin overlying the femoral nerve (approximately
halfway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the
pubic tubercle, proximal to the groin crease but distal to
the inguinal nerve) and a carbon-rubber anode electrode
(Dermatrodeself-adheringelectrode,5.08cmindiameter;
Farmadomo Linde Homecare Benelux Bv, Leiden, The
Netherlands)wasplacedovertheskinoverlyingthegluteus
muscle. In the TA, a bar electrode with the anode and
cathode spaced 3 cm apart (Model MLADDF30; AD
Instruments, Oxford, UK) was held over the common
peroneal nerve around 5–10 mm distal of the fibular
notch. Stimulation was applied using a manually triggered
stimulator (model DS7AH; Digitimer, Welwyn Garden
City, UK). Across a sequence of stimulations the current
was increased incrementally until there was no further
increase in CMAP. This generally occurred at 100–200 mA.
To ensure supra-maximal stimulation, the current was
then increased by a further 30 mA.
After measuring the CMAP, the participant was asked
to relax the muscle and an intramuscular needle electrode
was inserted at approximately 60° angle to ensure
the tip was beneath the active sEMG electrode and
at approximately 2–3 cm depth. The needle position
was adjusted to ensure the detection of motor unit
potentials (MUPs) with sharp rise-times during brief,
low-intensity voluntary contractions. The participant was
then instructed to perform a muscle contraction to match
as closely as possible a target line presented on a computer
monitor set at 25% of the MVC. The contraction was
held for 15 s, with real-time visual feedback available
throughout. Between four and six contractions were sub-
sequently performed following the same procedures, with
short rest intervals and the needle repositioned between
contractionstosamplefromarangeofdepthsandspatially
distinct areas. This was done by combinations of rotating
the needle 180° and withdrawing it by around 5 mm.
All EMG signals were recorded for offline analysis
withdecomposition-basedquantitativeelectromyography
(DQEMG) (Stashuk, 1999). Our protocol required
a minimum of 10 iEMG-measured MUPs and the
corresponding surface-measured MUPs (sMUPs) to be
recorded from each muscle for the data to be included in
analysis. MUP area was defined as the total area within the
MUP duration (Piasecki et al. 2016a,b).
Motor unit number estimates: MUNE and iMUNE
The traditional motor unit number estimate (MUNE)
methodology compares the average sMUP with the CMAP
recorded following maximal electrical stimulation (Gooch
et al. 2014; Piasecki et al. 2015). MUNE values were
obtained using spike-triggered ensemble-averaging, in
which MUP occurrence times identified from the iEMG
signal were used to trigger sEMG signal epochs which were
then ensemble-averaged allowing sMUPs to be extracted
(Brown et al. 1988). The sMUPs were then aligned based
on onset time to create an ensemble-averaged mean sMUP.
The negative peak amplitude of the averaged sMUP was
divided into the negative peak amplitude of the electrically
evoked maximal CMAP to obtain an MUNE value. A
further estimate of motor unit number, the intramuscular
MUNE (iMUNE), was also made. This assumes that the
MUP area recorded from iEMG is proportional to the
CSA of the fibres of the active motor unit (Nandedkar
et al. 1988a). Dividing the CSA of a muscle by the mean
MUP area (cm2/mV/ms) provides a value proportional
to the total number of MUs within that cross-section of
muscle (Piasecki et al. 2016a,b, 2018).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean (SD) where normally
distributed or median (interquartile range, IQR) where
not normally distributed. All VL QCSA data were
converted to z-scores relative to values in younger
participants (where the values for young would be:
mean = 0; SD = 1). Stages of sarcopenia in older
participants were determined from QCSA threshold
values in younger participants: sarcopenia was defined as
axz-score � −2 to identify older men with muscle mass
lower than values found within the 95% range of the
normal distribution of young men, and corresponding
knee

weakness.
Pre-sarcopenic
men
were
identified as having muscle mass in the lower quartile of
the distribution of young men (z-score −1 to −1.99), and

corresponding knee extensor weakness, but not meeting
the criteria for sarcopenia. The non-sarcopenic men were
identified as older men who were not pre-sarcopenic nor
sarcopenic (z-score > −0.99).
Where data were normally distributed, between-group
differences were compared using one-way ANOVA. When
significantdifferenceswereobservedaBonferroni post-hoc
test was performed. Where the data were not normally
distributed, between-group differences were compared
using a Kruskal–Wallis test. When significant differences
were observed, a Dunn–Bonferroni post-hoc test was
performed. Linear mixed models were used to assess
group by muscle interactions, in which these factors were
the fixed effects, and participants were random effects.
Analysis was performed using SPSS Version 21 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA) software and P � 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Sarcopenia groups
Older participants were classified as non-sarcopenic,
pre-sarcopenicorsarcopenicbasedontheirQCSAz-scores
relative to values in younger people (Fig. 1). These groups
had similar weight, BMI and body fat percentage. Younger
men were taller than older men and this difference
increased through the stages of sarcopenia. In the older
men, the presence of sarcopenia was related to older age
(Table 1).
Muscle size and maximal force
As per the experimental design, muscle size decreased
through the stages of non-sarcopenic, pre-sarcopenic and
sarcopenic men (Table 1). Compared with young men,
mean QCSA was 8% lower in the non-sarcopenic men,
30% lower in the pre-sarcopenic men and 44% lower in
the sarcopenic men. Normalising QCSA to femur CSA
to account for differences between people in body size
produced similar results.
Height-adjusted appendicular lean mass (ALM/h2) was
similar for young and non-sarcopenic old, but was 12%
lower in pre-sarcopenic men and 22% lower in sarcopenic
men compared with the young. The mean value of
6.66 kg m−2 in the sarcopenic group was lower than
the 7.26 kg m−2 cut-off value commonly used to define
sarcopenia (Cruz-Jentoft et al. 2010).
Knee extensor MVC was 34, 39 and 49% lower
for non-sarcopenic old, pre-sarcopenic and sarcopenic
groups,
respectively,
compared
with
young
men.
Sarcopenic men had a lower MVC than pre-sarcopenic
and non-sarcopenic old men (Table 1).
The ankle dorsiflexors were relatively well preserved
compared to the age-dependent differences seen in the
knee extensors (4 group × 2 muscle interaction effect for
CSA and MVC, both P < 0.001). TA CSA and dorsiflexion
MVC were similar for young and non-sarcopenic old men;
but were 19 and 23%, respectively, lower in pre-sarcopenic
old, and 20 and 33%, respectively, lower in sarcopenic old
than young men.
Motor unit potential size
In the VL muscle, sMUPs did not differ between groups
(Table 1), but intramuscularly measured MUPs were
larger by 26 and 41%, respectively, in non-sarcopenic
and pre-sarcopenic old than young men. MUPs were
significantly
smaller
in
sarcopenic
compared
with
pre-sarcopenic men (Fig. 2).
In the TA muscle, sMUPs and MUPs were larger in all
older groups compared with young, with no difference
between healthy old, pre-sarcopenic or sarcopenic groups.
There was a significant group × muscle interaction effect
(4 groups, 2 muscles) for sMUPs (P = 0.001), but not for
MUPs (P = 0.173).
Age was not significantly correlated with sMUP or
intramuscular MUP size in VL or TA (all r < 0.02;
P > 0.30) and adjusting for age in groups of older
adults made no difference to the results of between-group
comparisons.
Motor unit numbers
The
MUNE
value
is
derived
from
the
ratio
of
CMAP/sMUP and is commonly used to indicate motor
unitnumbersintheTA.MUNEvaluesforTAwere63–65%
lower in older men compared with young men, with no
differencebetweenthenon-sarcopenicold,pre-sarcopenic
and sarcopenic groups (Table 1).
The iMUNE method provides values proportional to
motor unit number after accounting for muscle size. TA
iMUNE was 48% lower in all older groups compared with
young men, with no difference between non-sarcopenic
old, pre-sarcopenic and sarcopenic groups (Fig. 2). VL
iMUNE was 33, 47 and 50% lower in non-sarcopenic old,
pre-sarcopenic and sarcopenic, respectively, compared
with young. Values in pre-sarcopenic and sarcopenic
groups were similar, and both were significantly lower
than the non-sarcopenic old. A significant group × muscle
interaction (4 groups × 2 muscle) showed the difference
between groups in iMUNE was greater in TA than in VL
(P < 0.001).
When looking at groups of older men, age was not
significantlycorrelatedwithiMUNEineitherVLorTA(all
r < 0.02; P > 0.50), and adjusting for age in groups of older
adults made no difference to the results of between-group
comparisons.

Motor unit remodelling and sarcopenia
1633
Discussion
Our study is the first to directly compare motor unit
number and size estimates in adults with different levels
of sarcopenia. The results show that loss of motor units
occurs relatively early during ageing, exceeds the loss
of muscle mass and precedes sarcopenia. The surviving
motor units were enlarged in the non-sarcopenic and
pre-sarcopenic old, but not in the sarcopenic old. These
findings suggest that a failure to expand the motor unit size
distinguishes sarcopenic from pre-sarcopenic muscles.
A recent study compared TA motor unit numbers in
groups described as pre-sarcopenic, sarcopenic and severe
sarcopenic (Gilmore et al. 2017). In agreement with our
findings for TA, they found that motor unit numbers
were similar across groups. However, the small sample size
(n = 7 sarcopenic; n = 5 severely sarcopenic), and the fact
that muscle size did not differ significantly between the
groups described as pre-sarcopenic, sarcopenic and severe
sarcopenic limits the conclusions of this study. Definitions
of sarcopenia have evolved over the past two decades, but
low muscle mass is the definitive criterion (Cruz-Jentoft
et al. 2010).
In the present study, both the MRI and the DXA
measurements clearly demonstrated a progressive decline
of muscle mass across groups (Fig. 1, Table 1).
The 26 sarcopenic men would be classified as such
by all commonly used definitions due to their low
knee extensor strength, and the average ALM/h2 of
6.66 kg m−2 was well below accepted cut-offs, such as
the 7.26 kg m−2 recommended by a European Working
Group (Cruz-Jentoft et al. 2010).
Motor unit number estimates
Recent technical advances enable enhanced decompo-
sition of intramuscular EMG signals into MUPs and
identification of the corresponding sMUPs (Parsaei et al.
2012; Parsaei & Stashuk, 2013), proportional to motor
unit size (Nandedkar et al. 1988a,b). Normalising the
ensemble-averaged sMUP to the CMAP provides an
estimate of motor unit number by asking, how many
motor units fit into the CMAP? (Bromberg, 2007; Gooch
et al. 2014). A technique was adapted for the larger VL
(also relevant to the TA) to reduce effects of EMG signal
attenuation from deeper muscle regions (Muceli et al.
2015). It normalises the motor unit size to the muscle
cross-section (known as iMUNE; Piasecki et al. 2018) to
ask simply, how many motor units fit into the muscle
cross-section? Both techniques suggest that the group of
non-sarcopenic men (mean age 68 years) with similar
size muscles to young men had approximately 40% fewer
TA motor units than young, and the iMUNE estimated
approximately 30% fewer VL motor units than young
(Table 1, Fig. 2).
Our hypothesis that motor unit numbers would
progressively decrease from young adults through to
healthy old, pre-sarcopenic and sarcopenic men was not
supported in the TA. TA motor unit numbers were already

low in the non-sarcopenic group and remained at similar
levels in pre-sarcopenic and sarcopenic men (Table 1).
This hypothesis was based on the assumption that
muscle size would decrease with increasing sarcopenia
in older participants, but this was not the case for TA
(Fig. 2). In line with previous reports (Abe et al. 2011;
Pannerec et al. 2016), the TA was only 10–15% smaller in
older participants compared with the young, which was
significantly less than the 30–44% quadriceps atrophy
affecting pre-sarcopenic and sarcopenic men (Table 1,
Fig. 2).
The VL iMUNE values were highest in the young,
intermediate in the non-sarcopenic old and lowest in
the pre-sarcopenic and sarcopenic men (Fig. 2). The
younger average age of the non-sarcopenic men might
have been a reason for their higher VL iMUNE and muscle
mass when compared to sarcopenic men (McNeil et al.
2005). However, we found that when looking at all older
men together, there was no relationship between age and
MUNE, iMUNE or muscle size, so advancing older age
per se does not appear to be the critical factor determining
limb motor unit numbers or sarcopenia status.

Motor unit remodelling and sarcopenia
1635
Our observation that TA had considerably fewer motor
units in older men but muscle size was relatively well pre-
served, and that pre-sarcopenic and sarcopenic groups had
different muscle mass but similar motor unit numbers
in VL, does not support our original study hypothesis.
Rather, these data suggest that loss of muscle mass does
not occur in direct proportion to declining motor unit
numbers. The observation that the size of motor units
differed across older groups suggests that this factor also
contributes to muscle lost during ageing.
Motor unit size estimates
Previous work from several sources indicates that muscle
size can be preserved despite the considerable loss of
motor units if the surviving units expand by sprouting
new branches to innervate the denervated muscle fibres
(Deschenes, 2011; Kung et al. 2014). Because loss of motor
units is age-related, this process leads to larger motor
units in older compared to young people. A summary
of results from different studies found 49% larger motor
unit potentials in older compared with younger people,
but there was large heterogeneity in findings between
muscles and between studies (Dalton et al. 2008; Hourigan
et al. 2015; Piasecki et al. 2016a,b). In the present study,
we observed that in non-sarcopenic and pre-sarcopenic
elderly men, a doubling of motor unit size in TA and a
26–42% higher motor unit size in VL (Fig. 2) was not
associated with preservation of muscle mass (10–15%
lower in TA and 30–44% lower in quadriceps; Table 1).
A failure to rescue some fibres leading to fewer fibres
in older than younger men, alongside age-related muscle
fibre atrophy (primarily affecting type 2 fibres) (Lexell
et al. 1988; Barnouin et al. 2017), accounts for the net loss
of muscle mass.
Crucially, our results show for the first time that
sarcopenic muscles do not follow the expected trend
towards increasing motor unit size. Instead, motor
units were significantly smaller in sarcopenic than in
pre-sarcopenic men (Fig. 2). There are two probable
explanations for this. First, the average muscle fibre
CSAs of sarcopenic individuals may be relatively small,
similar to those found in very old adults (Scelsi et al.
1980) Secondly, sarcopenic muscle may experience a
failureofreinnervation,similartomuscleofoctogenarians
(Spendiff et al. 2016), which would precipitate myofibre
loss, leaving motor units with lower innervation ratios and
smaller motor unit potentials. Similar characteristics are
seen in severely atrophied rodent muscles with increased
numbers of very small fibres expressing markers of
denervation (Rowan et al. 2012), probably due to a failure
of reinnervation (Aare et al. 2016).
Overall, these findings have important implications
for the progression of sarcopenia and the prospects
of reversing this condition. When motor neurons or
muscle fibres are lost, it is possible that they can
never be replaced and this could limit the efficacy
of any therapeutic interventions and, consequently,
more emphasis should be placed on the prevention of
sarcopenia.Thepathophysiologicalprocesses determining
the fate of motor neurons and denervated fibres remain
unknown and this is clearly an important area for future
research. Some results suggest that long-term exercise
training might prevent the loss of motor units (Power et al.
2010, 2016), but others show no obvious sparing of motor
unitnumberswithlife-longexercise(Piaseckietal.2016a).
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths: (a) it is the first to directly
compare motor unit number and size in adults with
different levels of sarcopenia; (b) the largest sample size
of any studies of motor units in older age gives higher
statistical power to identify important relationships when
compared to previous studies; and (c) the latest iEMG and
decomposition techniques were used to determine MUPs
and accurate imaging including MRI and DEXA scanning
enabled accurate determination of muscle size and thus
sarcopenic status.
Thereareseverallimitations.(a)Asinallclinicalstudies,
direct motor unit counts were not possible (Piasecki
et al. 2015; Hepple & Rice, 2016), so indirect estimates
from intramuscular EMG were used to derive values
proportional to motor unit numbers. These techniques
are very well established and take the MUP size as
representative of motor unit size (Nandedkar et al. 1988a).
Normalisation to the CMAP for the MUNE, or muscle
CSA for the iMUNE, is straightforward. (b) We were only
able to confidently decompose individual motor units
from EMG signals during moderate-intensity contra-
ctions. According to the ‘size principle’ (Henneman et al.
1965), the larger, high-threshold motor units may not
have been active and may have differed between groups.
However, this has the added advantage that the active
motor units would be mainly composed of the earlier
recruited type 1 muscle fibres, and because old and
young adults have similar type 1 fibre CSA (Lexell et al.
1988; Barnouin et al. 2017) we can be confident that
the increase in MUPs from young to non-sarcopenic and
pre-sarcopenic men is due to increased motor unit size
rather than increased fibre CSA or circumference.
Conclusions
We have shown that motor unit losses occur relatively
early during the ageing process and this contributes
to the sarcopenic condition. The data suggest that the
expansion of surviving motor units provides a regulatory
mechanism to preserve muscle mass. Importantly, what
distinguished sarcopenic from pre-sarcopenic men was

a failure to expand motor unit size. Overall, our results
suggest that both the loss of motor neurons per se and the
collateral sprouting from surviving motor nerve branches
to reinnervate muscle fibres of defunct motor units are
critical factors determining the progression of sarcopenia.
