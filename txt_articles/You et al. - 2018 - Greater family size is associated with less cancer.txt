Abstract
Background: Greater family size measured with total fertility rate (TFR) and with household size, may offer more life
satisfaction to the family members. Positive psychological well-being has been postulated to decrease cancer
initiation risk. This ecological study aims to examine the worldwide correlation between family size, used as the
measure of positive psychological well-being, and total cancer incidence rates.
Methods: Country specific estimates obtained from United Nations agencies on total cancer incidence rates (total,
female and male rates in age range 0–49 years and all ages respectively), all ages site cancer incidence (bladder,
breast, cervix uteri, colorectum, corpus uteri, lung, ovary and stomach), TFR, household size, life expectancy,
urbanization, per capita GDP PPP and self-calculated Biological State Index (Ibs) were matched for data analysis.
Pearson’s, non-parametric Spearman’s, partial correlations, independent T-test and multivariate regressions were
conducted in SPSS.
Results: Worldwide, TFR and household size were significantly and negatively correlated to all the cancer incidence
variables. These correlations remained significant in partial correlation analysis when GDP, life expectancy, Ibs and
urbanization were controlled for. TFR correlated to male cancer incidence rate (all ages) significantly stronger than it
did to female cancer incidence rate (all ages) in both Pearson’s and partial correlations. Multivariate stepwise
regression analysis indicated that TFR and household size were consistently significant predictors of all cancer
incidence variables.
Conclusions: Countries with greater family size have lower cancer risk in both females, and especially males. Our
results seem to suggest that it may be worthwhile further examining correlations between family size and cancer
risk in males and females through the cohort and case-control studies based on large samples.

Background
Total fertility rate (TFR) representing the total number
of births during a lifetime of a female [1, 2] has been
used to measure childbearing and family size [3–5] in a
number of studies. The prevalent conclusions were that
more childbearing (greater TFR) may protect against
female breast cancer [6, 7], corpus uteri cancer [8] and
ovarian cancer [9] due to less oestrogen production or
less menstrual cycles [10] and more oxytocin secretion
[11, 12], but may contribute to cervix uteri cancer
because of more exposure to infection risk [13].
The number of children born into a family does not
only influence the mother’s physiological health of her
reproductive system, but also has effects on health,
including cancer development, and on her other systems
and on all the other family members. For instance,
greater family size has been postulated to protect family
members from developing colorectal cancer [5], melan-
oma of skin [5], bladder cancer [5], breast cancer [5] and
stomach cancer (in males only) [14]. Relationships
between greater family size /household size and lung
cancer [5, 15] and stomach cancer (females) [14] were

 explored, but without much success of seeing a clear
trend. Aldrich et al. [15] reported that household size
was in significant association with a risk of developing
lung cancer in African Americans, but not in Latinos.
These controversial and circumstantial correlations
between reproductive behaviour and a comprehensive
health effect on all family members directed our atten-
tion to seeking alternative explanation of the relationship
between TFR and risk factors for cancer. Psychological
factors have been suggested to be linked with cancer initi-
ation, but the mechanism has been intriguing profes-
sionals and laypeople for decades [16, 17]. Although
studies on the possible effects of positive and negative psy-
chological factors arising from life events on cancer inci-
dence and prognosis are numerous, the literature remains
contradictory as to methods and impacts [15, 18–20].
Extensive studies have suggested that adverse life events
and the associated psychological stress may predispose to
cancers in various body sites [21–25]. Everson et al. [26]
reported that more stress may increase the cancer risk.
This might be because people tend to recall adverse life
events, but easily forget those positive ones, which con-
stantly happen in the daily life. Cancer patients may more
easily recall those negative life events which have been
considered as cancer risks [27–31]. Only a limited number
of studies have addressed the relationship between life
satisfaction and cancer risk [15, 32], but the conclusions
were controversial.
Research conducted into health effects of positive
psychological well-being has concluded that family life
satisfaction may stimulate oxytocin production in the
human body [33–39], which may have the inhibitory
effect on specific cancers [11, 12, 40, 41]. For example,
positive psychological wellbeing has been postulated to
protect against cancer risk in Israeli women [32], reduce
the number of American cancer patients from going into
metastasis [42] and help cancer patients with cancer’s
detection, treatment, and survival [42]. Large families
have greater life satisfaction in both Western and
Eastern populations [43, 44]. Nan et al. [44] have also
concluded that the bigger family size is, the higher
Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) result is in the family,
regardless of cultural backgrounds.
Therefore, in this study, we assessed, from a global
perspective, whether greater family size, measured with
TFR [3] and household size may lower cancer risk using
empirical, macro-level data obtained from international
organizations.
Methods
Data sources
The population specific data were collected for this
ecological study.
1. The GLOBOCAN 2012 estimates of incidence rates
(age standardised, world) of all cancers excluding
non-melanoma skin cancer (C00–97, but C44) in
total, and separately for males and females of all
ages [45] were used. Crude estimates of incidence
rates of all cancers excluding non-melanoma skin
cancer (C00–97, but C44) in total, and for males and
females in age group 0–49 years were also obtained.
The incidence rates of the individual site-specific
cancers (bladder, breast, cervix uteri, colorectum,
corpus uteri, lung, melanoma and ovary) were
extracted as the dependent variables for data
analysis in this study. The results from this study
were aligned with the findings of previous studies of
the relationships between family/household size and
each of these site-specific cancers namely lung
cancer [15], bladder cancer, melanoma and colon
cancer [5].
GLOBOCAN is a project conducted by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) of the World Health Organization. This
project provides contemporary population level
estimates by cancer site and sex using the best
available data in each population and uses nine
comprehensive methods of estimation [46].
2. The United Nations Statistics Division estimates of
the life expectancy [47], the total population in
households and the number of households [48].
Life expectancy is the average number of years a
person of a given age, residing in a given country is
expected to live. We extracted the life expectancy at
age 60 years (e60, 2005–2010) from abridged life
Tables (1950–2100) [47] published online. Ageing
has been a significant risk predictor of cancer. In
this study, life expectancy (e60) was considered as
the indicator of ageing.
As instructed by the United Nations Statistics
Division, we created a new variable, household size,
through dividing the total population in households
[48] by the number of households [48] in each
country.
3. The World Bank published data [1] on Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), total fertility rate (TFR)
and urbanization.
GDP was expressed in per capita purchasing power
parity (PPP in current international $) in 2010. The
World Bank also clusters countries into 4
classifications in terms of their GDP per capita
(High Income, Upper Middle Income, Low Middle
Income and Low Income). In this study, we
grouped countries with High Income and Upper
Middle Income as developed countries, and
countries with Low Middle Income and Low
Income as developing countries.
You et al. BMC Cancer  (2018) 18:924

 Urbanization was expressed with the percentage of
total population living in urban areas in 2010.
Total Fertility Rate (TFR) represents total births per
woman during her lifetime. It indicates the number
of children that would be born to a woman if she
were to live to the end of her childbearing years
and bear children in accordance with age-specific
fertility rates of the specified year.
Total births per woman have been used to indicate
the family size in studies at an individual level [3, 4].
Therefore, we used TFR as the measure of family size
in this study, and terms “TFR” and “family size” were
interchangeably used thereafter. Household size is
used as the proxy of family size in this study that has
been calculated from data independent from those
used for TFR.
4. Biological State Index (Ibs) was self-calculated
[49, 50] with the fertility data of each country
published by United Nations in 2008 [51] and the
mortality data of life Tables (2009) published by
World Health Organization (WHO) in 2012 [52].
Ibs was included as one of the confounding factors
that indicates the level of adaptation of a population
[53]. The Ibs values range between 0 and 1.0. A
greater Ibs value of a population means less
opportunity for natural selection, and vice versa.
The simplest interpretation of Ibs is that it indicates
a probability with which an average person born
into a population is able to pass her/his genes to
the next generation. Recent studies have postulated
that Ibs may indicate the magnitude of deleterious
gene/mutation accumulation in a population due to
relaxed natural selection [53–56]. The greater Ibs
value means that a population has accumulated
more deleterious gene/mutations of cancer [54],
obesity [55] and type 1 diabetes [56], and vice versa
[53–56]. Inclusion of Ibs as a confounder may
remove the influence of cancer gene/mutation
accumulation on the correlation between family size
and cancer incidence.
Data selection
We used country specific cancer incidence rates, TFR,
GDP, urbanization, household size and life expectancies
for all countries where the most updated and recent data
were available (N = 178). In order to capture as many
countries as we could for this study, we aligned country
specific TFR with all cancer incidence rates, and then we
matched other country-specific variables with the TFR.
Each country was treated as an individual subject in
the analysis. Numbers of countries included in analyses
of relationships with other variables may differ some-
what because all information was not uniformly available
for all countries. The list of countries included in this
study can be found in Additional file 1.
We singled out the population segment aged 0–49 years
because females enter menopause at around 50 years of
age and since then they produce less and less female
hormones. Numerous studies have associated female
oestrogen level with cancer risk [10, 11].
All the aforementioned data were freely available from
the websites of the UN agencies. No ethical approval or
written informed consent for participation was required.
Data analysis
Scatter plots were produced in Excel (Microsoft® 2016)
to explore and visualize the correlations between family
size and cancer incidence rates for all ages in total popu-
lation, males and females respectively. Scatterplots were
repeated in the age group (0–49) for further testing the
relationships between family size and cancer incidence
rates. Scatter plots allowed us to assess data quality and
distributions of variables. In the supplemental material,
family
size
was
replaced
with
household
size
for
performing the scatter plots (Additional file 2).
Prior
to
correlation/regression
analyses
all
data
were
log-transformed
(ln)
in
order
to
reduce
non-homoscedascity
of
their
distributions
and
possible curvilinearity of regressions. To assess the
relationships between each cancer incidence rate and
family size, the analysis proceeded in four steps.
1. Pearson’s and nonparametric correlations
(Spearman’s rho) were used to evaluate the strength
and direction of the associations between family
size and all other variables, including independent
variables and confounders.
2. Partial correlation of Pearson’s moment-product
approach was used to assess the relationship
between each cancer incidence rate and family size
respectively while we controlled for GDP PPP
[45, 46], urbanization [57, 58], Ibs and life
expectancy [59] which have been commonly
considered as the contributing factors of cancer.
Fisher’s r-to-z transformation was performed to test
significance of differences between correlation
coefficients.
3. Standard multiple linear regression (stepwise) was
performed to identify the most significant
predictor(s) of cancer risk. The dependent variables
included cancer incidence rate by sex (total, male
and female, age group 0–49 and all ages
respectively). The independent variables/predictors
entered into analyses were family size, urbanization,
GDP, Ibs and life expectancy (not for cancer
variables for 0–49 years).
You et al. BMC Cancer  (2018) 18:924 
Page 3 of 14
 4. The independent samples t-test was performed to
compare the means of each cancer variable in high
and low fertility countries divided at the cut point
of TFR = 2.36. We used 2.36 as the cut point
because it is the world average TFR published by
the United Nations for the period of 2010–2015 [60].
Socioeconomic level plays a critical role in family
happiness. In parallel to the analyses of the relationship
between family size and cancer variables worldwide, the
relationships between family size and each cancer vari-
able in developed and developing country groupings
were also examined respectively. Descriptive statistics
including standard
deviations
of
all
variables
were
calculated for analysing and comparing the covariance
(relationship between family size and cancer incidence)
in all countries (n = 178), in developed world (n = 98)
and in developing world (n = 80).
Subsequently, family size was substituted with house-
hold size for reanalysing the associations and regressions.
The results were reported in Additional files 3 and 4
(Tables S2 and S3). There was no stratification of country
grouping in the supplemental analyses due to limited
sample size of countries for which household size was
available (n = 58).
Pearson’s, non-parametric Spearman’s rho correlations,
partial correlation, stepwise multiple linear regression,
independent samples t-test analyses and descriptive
statistics were calculated using SPSS v. 22 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago Il USA). To increase homoscedasticity of data
distributions, log-transformed variables were used for
correlation analyses. The significance was reported when
P-value was < 0.05, but the significance levels of p < 0.01
and
p < 0.001
were
also
indicated
in
the
tables.
Regression analysis criteria were set at probability of F
to enter ≤0.05 and probability of F to remove ≥0.10. The
raw data were used for scatter plots.
Results
Figure 1 shows a negative and strong correlation of family
size to cancer incidence rates in total population and in
males and females separately (all ages). The non-linear
relationships between family size and group cancer
incidence variables (total population, males, females in all
ages) identified in the scatterplots show the strong
correlation between family size and cancer incidence rate
(R2 = 0.4901,
0.3755
and
0.5637
respectively).
The
relationships are also true in the age (0–49) group (Fig. 2).
Household size as the proxy of family size has shown the
similar correlation to all cancers incidence rates (total,
female and male) (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
The
subsequent
analyses
of
log-transformed
data
proved these relationships. Globally (n = 178), Spear-
man’s rank correlation showed that family size was in
significant negative correlation to all cancers incidence
rates (both sexes) in all ages (r = − 0.716, p < 0.001) and
in age group 0–49 years (r = − 0.752, p < 0.001), separ-
ately in females of all ages (r = − 0.640, p < 0.001) and
age group 0–49 years (r = − 0.762, p < 0.001) and in
males of all ages (r = − 0.761, p < 0.001) and age group
0–49 years (r = − 0.765, p < 0.001) (Table 1). Pearson’s r
showed quite similar relationship trends between family
size and the cancer variables (Table 1).
When family size was replaced with household size for
supplemental data analysis, household size also showed
significant, negative and strong correlation to each cancer
variable (both sexes, female and male in age groups, 0–49
and all ages respectively) (Additional file 3: Table S1).
In developed countries grouping (n = 98), Spearman’s
rank correlation showed that family size was in signifi-
cant negative correlation to all cancers incidence rates
(both sexes) in all ages (r = − 0.540, p < 0.001) and age
group 0–49 years (r = − 0.705, p < 0.001), separately in
females of all ages (r = − 0.477, p < 0.001) and age group
0–49 years (r = − 0.581, p < 0.001) (Table 1) and in males
of all ages (r = − 0.582, p < 0.001) and age group 0–
49 years (r = − 0.705, p < 0.001). Pearson’s r showed quite
similar relationship trends between family size and the
cancer variables (Table 1).
In developing countries grouping (n = 80), Spear-
man’s rank correlation showed that family size was in
significant negative correlation to all cancers inci-
dence rates in all ages (r = − 0.334, p < 0.001) and age
group 0–49 years (r = − 0.498, p < 0.001), separately in
females of age group 0–49 years (r = − 0.482, p < 0.001)
but not at all ages (r = − 0.140) and in males of all
ages (r = − 0.457, p < 0.001) and age group 0–49 years
(r = − 0.449, p < 0.001) (Table 1). Pearson’s r showed
quite similar relationship trends between family size
and the cancer variables, except for all cancers inci-
dence rate in females at all ages (r = − 0.200, r < 0.05)
(Table 1).
When, in the partial correlation analyses, we controlled
for the major confounders (GDP, urbanization, life expect-
ancy (not for cancer variable in age group 0–49 years) and
Ibs): 1) globally (n = 178), family size remained in the
significant correlation to all cancer incidence rates (both
sexes) in all ages (r = − 0.362, p < 0.001) and the age group
0–49 years (r = − 0.534, p < 0.001), in females of all
ages (r = − 0.230 p < 0.001) and age group 0–49 years
(r = − 0.492, p < 0.001) and in males of all ages (r = −
0.449, p < 0.001) and age group 0–49 years (r = −
0.542,
p < 0.001)
(Table
1).

 In developed world (n = 98), family size also remained
in the significant correlation to all cancers incidence
rates (both sexes) in all ages (r = − 0.625, p < 0.001)
and the age group 0–49 years (r = − 0.658, p < 0.001),
in males of all ages (r = − 0.470, p < 0.001) and age
group
0–49
years
(r = − 0.581,
p < 0.001)
and
in
females of all ages (r = − 0.362, p < 0.001) and the age
group 0–49 years (r = − 0.534, p < 0.001) (Table 1). 3)
In developing world (n = 80), family size remained in
the significant correlation to all cancer incidence rates
(both sexes) in the age group 0–49 years (r = − 0.430,
p < 0.001) but not at all ages group, in females of age
group 0–49 years (r = − 0.384, p < 0.001) but not at all
ages and in males of all ages (r = − 0.303, p < 0.05)
and the age group 0–49 years (r = − 0.430, p < 0.001)
(Table 1).
Table 1 also shows that, globally (n = 178) and in
developed world (n = 98), each of the incidence rates (all
ages) of individual site cancers in bladder, breast,
colorectum, corpus uteri, lung, skin (melanoma), ovary
and stomach was in significant, negative and strong
correlation to family size in both Pearson’s and partial
correlation analyses (Table 1). Globally (n = 178), cervix
uteri cancer correlated with family size significantly and
positively in both Pearson’s r and non-parametric correl-
ation,
but
the
correlation
was
neither
strong
nor
significant in partial correlation (Table 1). In developed
world (n = 80), cervix uteri cancer did not show correl-
ation (partial) or very weak correlation (Pearson’s r) with
family size (Table 1) although it statistically significantly
correlated with family size (r = 0.223, p < 0.05). In devel-
oping world (n = 80), only correlations between family
size and lung cancer and cervix uteri cancer were con-
sistent with those revealed globally and in developed
world (Table 1).
The correlations, especially the partial correlations
between family size and cancer variables in all coun-
tries (n = 178) and in developed world (n = 98) were
stronger and more significant than those in develop-
ing world. Variances of cancer incidence variables in
developing world (n = 80) were smaller than their
counterparts in the developed world and all countries
grouping (Additional file 5).
Table 2 shows that, globally (n = 178), the mean in-
cidence rate of each cancer variable in country group
(n = 95)
with TFR ≥ 2.36 was significantly (p < 0.001)
lower than that of country group (n = 83) with TFR < 2.36
except cervix uteri cancer. This trend remained in the
developed country grouping (n = 98) except cervix uteri
and stomach cancers, and in developing grouping (n = 80)
except cancers in breast, cervix uteri, melanoma (skin)
and ovary.

 In the standard multiple linear (stepwise) regression
analyses, family size was the significant predictor of the
total, male and female cancer incidence rates (with
exception of all female cancers at all ages) in samples of
all ages and in age group 0–49 years respectively when
family size, GDP, life expectancy (not for age group
0–49 years) and Ibs were entered as the independent
variables/predictors (Table 3). Although family size is
a significant predictor of the variable of all cancers in
females at all ages, the value of its beta coefficient
was smaller than for the variable of all cancers in
males at all ages. This finding was consistent with
those reported in Table 1 that family size was in
significantly
stronger
negative
association
with
all
cancers in males at all ages than it was with all can-
cers in females at all ages in both Pearson’s (z = 2.43,
p = 0.015) and partial (z = 2.22, p = 0.026) correlation
analyses. This means that greater family size may
have more protective effects on male cancer risk than
on female (cancer risk.
Comparing with those correlations in all countries and
in developed world, correlations between family size and
cancer variables became weak and/or insignificant in the
developing country grouping when standard deviation of
cancer variable became low (Additional file 4: Table S2).
As the proxy of family size, household size was identi-
fied as the significant predictor of the total, male and
female cancer incidence rates in samples of all ages and
in age group 0–49 years respectively when household
size, GDP, urbanisation, life expectancy (not for age
group 0–49 years) and Ibs were entered as the independ-
ent variables/predictors in the standard multiple linear
(stepwise) regression analysis (Additional file 5: Table S3).
Discussion
Cancer risk has been associated with multiple aetiol-
ogies, which may act through various mechanisms. Our
results showed that: 1) Worldwide, smaller family size
may be an independent determinant of increased cancer
risk. 2) increased family size may show more protecting
effects on cancer risk in males than females.
It is necessary to note the limitations of our work
before analysing the public health implications of this
study:
First, the observational data were used in our work,
which makes the results subject to inherent bias, i.e.
“correlation
between
two
variables does
not
mean
causality”.
Second,
we
must
highlight
the
ecological
fallacy
(intrinsic limitation) arising from the ecological study

 approach which was adopted in this study. The data in-
cluded in this study were calculated for country/popula-
tions as a whole. Thus, values for risk-modifying factors
do not always hold true for individuals to predict their
cancer risk. However, we would like to note that it is
nearly impossible to test the relationships at the individ-
ual family level due to rare occurrence rate of cancers,
and even rarer in some individual site-specific cancers,
such as ovarian cancer.
Finally, data compiled and/or collected by the major
international agencies (WHO, IARC, the United Nations
and the World Bank) might be crude, and may contain
some random errors arising from methods of reporting
incidence of specific diseases, reliability of diagnoses and
possible administrative errors.
Despite these limitations, findings from different data
analyses in this study consistently show that country
with greater TFR (family size) has lower cancer inci-
dence rate regardless of age range and sex. This relation-
ship
trend
has
been
observed
in
the
correlations
between family size and not only the individual site can-
cers, but also all cancers (in males, females and both
sexes). The broad correlations between family size and
cancers expressed in different individual sites, sexes and
groups, may not be simply explained by the female hor-
monal fluctuation due to pregnancy and breastfeeding.
The relationship between psychological well-being and
diseases (body and mind) has been an old issue. In the
past, research into well-being has mainly focused on
negative attitudes and affects. The majority of the stud-
ies documented that negative life events (death, divorce,
injury, car crash etc.,), stressful life style, depression and/
or anxiety, may lead to developing cancers [32, 61].
However, there is a documented bias in the data col-
lected from the individual based surveys. In general, can-
cer patients tend to report negative events in excess
compared to other people with average or positive atti-
tudes [28, 30, 31]. This has been reported or reflected in
a number of studies [27–30] regarding the relationship
between cancer risk and adverse life events. According
to the ancient Chinese medicine textbook, which was
compiled 2200 years ago, it has been believed that
people have five internal organs of five gases (five
emotions), i.e. happiness, anger, sadness, worry and fear.
Among these five gases, only happiness makes the gas
smooth [62], which keeps people healthy.
Family has long been cited as a health promoting
factor [63, 64], and family size has been associated with
life satisfaction [43, 44, 65]. From the perspective of evolu-
tion, humans have adapted early to cooperative breeding
[66, 67], and then evolved alloparental care [68], and bio-
logical foundations of such human love may be heritable
generation by generation [69]. Our study has revealed that
greater family size, and possibly its associated positive
psychological well-being, may play a protective role
against cancer initiation. The mechanisms may include
following aspects:
1. Physiological and pathological functions of oxytocin
in human health
Positive
psychological
well-being
may
make
the
functions of neuroendocrine and immune systems more
efficient, which may reduce the risk of developing cancer
[61, 70–72].
Oxytocin is a peptide hormone and neuropeptide. Its
production
is
associated
with
good
feelings
and
emotions [73]. Males and females can produce and
release similar quantities of oxytocin [74] within the
hypothalamo-pituitary magnocellular systems. Researches
constantly revealed that family related activities are the
major promotors of oxytocin production. A stream of
studies in the last decade reported that oxytocin release is
not only associated with giving birth [75] and lactation
[76], but also with daily interactions between family mem-
bers, such as spouses [33–35], mother and children [36],
and father and children [37]. Oxytocin may be able to
keep family happy and stable as it makes females and
males stay monogamous [38, 39] and as it may bring posi-
tive psychological well-being to the family members. A
self-reinforcing cycle is formed between family members
interactions and oxytocin production.
Concurrently with the research into oxytocin produc-
tion, physiological and pathological functions of oxytocin
in humans have been the foci of numerous studies.
Oxytocin has been postulated to have a role in inhibiting
proliferation of human cancer cells, which may offer
protective role in preventing cancer initiation [41]. The
inhibitory role of oxytocin has been tested in individ-
ual site specific cancers, such as human breast cancer
[41, 77] and ovarian cancer (animal model) [12]. A
recent study reported that oxytocin, selectively acti-
vated by peptidylglycine α -amidating monooxygenase
(PAM), may play a role in preventing and controlling
a small cell lung cancer [78].
Bai et al. [27] reported that women with overall life
satisfaction had less chance developing breast cancer.
This may partly be true because life satisfaction may
promote women to produce more oxytocin to prevent
breast cancer cell initiation and proliferation. Another
mechanism may be that greater TFR may make women
produce less oestrogen and less menstrual cycles [10].
2. Less cancer genes/mutations accumulated in
population with greater TFR/family size
Natural selection acts on each population [53, 79]. The
total opportunity for natural selection in each population
You et al. BMC Cancer  (2018) 18:924 
Page 10 of 14
 has been previously measured with the Biological State
Index (Ibs) [49, 50, 53–56, 80]. An Ibs value of one indi-
cates total adaptation of the population to their environ-
ment. An Ibs value of zero signifies a total lack of
adaptation
(inability
to
overcome
natural
selection
pressures that are present), and an impossibility to give
life to the next generation [49, 50, 53–56, 80].
Our study indicated that Biological State Index (Ibs)
was in negative, strong and significant correlation to
TFR/family size globally, in developed world and devel-
oping country groups respectively (Table 1). This means
that population with greater TFR/family size is subject
to more effective natural selection. As the consequence
of less fitness, mortality rate due to various diseases,
such as cancers, may increase [49, 50, 53–56, 79, 80].
Thus, cancer genes/mutations would be more often
eliminated from a population with greater TFR/family
size. Moreover, greater total fertility rates indicate less
birth control therefore allowing more biological variation
in fertility [81]. A portion of this variation, however
small, provides opportunity for natural selection [81].
3. Family support and healthy lifestyle
Family members from the greater family size may
interact with each other more often to create life
satisfaction [43, 44]. Meanwhile, one family member can
remind and/or recommend other members to have ne-
cessary medical examination and have a healthy lifestyle
[42].
Bai et al. [27] reported that people with positive
psychological well-being may practice healthy lifestyle,
have the knowledge of cancer risks and benefits of
regular physical examination. It was reported that such
positive psychological well-being may decrease the risk
in the development of breast cancer [27, 32, 82].
In this study, we have also observed in Fisher’s analysis
that family size was in significantly stronger correlation
with all cancers incidence in males (all ages) than it was
with all cancers incidence in females (all ages). This find-
ing is supported by the studies which found that males
psychologically benefited more from having an extended
kinship network than females [42, 63, 64]. However, this
finding is inconsistent with Feller’s finding that reduced
life satisfaction was more related to the development of
cancer in women than in men [83]. The reason for this
inconsistency might be that Feller’s data collection was
based on the individual survey, which could be easily
biased [31].
Family size has been implicated in the aetiologies of
several individual site cancers, in previous studies based
on the data collected at the individual level. Our findings
were in agreement with the conclusions from the previ-
ous studies that greater family size was negatively
correlated to the risks of developing bladder cancer [5],
breast cancer [5, 6], colorectum cancer [5] and melan-
oma of skin. Although correlation does not necessarily
imply causality, it may be suggested that increased family
size may protect against the incidence of corpus uteri
cancer and ovary cancer, but increase the risk of devel-
oping cervical cancer. These findings were in agreement
with
the
prevailing
dogma
about
the
relationship
between parity and gynecologic cancers, that is that
more childbearing (greater TFR) may protect against
corpus uteri cancer [8] and ovary cancer [9] due to less
oestrogen production (less menstrual cycles) [10], but
may contribute to cervix uteri cancer because of more
exposure to infection risk [13]. However, our results
were not supported by the findings from the study
conducted by Hemminki et al. [5] that there were no
reportable significant correlations between family size
and risks of cervix uteri cancer, corpus uteri cancer and
ovarian cancer. A number of studies have reported that
ageing is one of the major contributors of corpus uteri
cancer [84] and ovary cancer [42]. That findings of
Hemminki et al. [5] were not compatible with our
findings may be because only young females (aged
mostly 5–43 years, up to 55 years) were included in their
studies.
Poor hygiene level related infection with human papil-
lomavirus is associated with cervical cancer initiation
[85]. In the developed world, like Sweden, high level of
hygiene or sanitation is accessible to almost all the
residents. This reduces risk for females to have human
papilloma virus infection, which
may
decrease the
cervical cancer risk. This may be the explanation why
Hemminki et al. [5] did not find the correlation between
family size and cervical cancer incidence.
Blaser et al. [14] have reported that greater family
size increased the risk of developing stomach cancer
only for male family members, but not for all family
members or female family members [14]. Aldrich et
al. [15] reported that greater household size corre-
lated with higher risk of lung cancer only in African
Americans, but not in Latinos. However, sex specific
or ancestry specific site cancer incidence was not
included in our study. Thus, we may not be able to
align our findings with the conclusions drawn by
Blaser et al. [14] or Aldrich et al. [15].
The correlations, especially the partial correlations
between family size and cancer variables in developing
world
were
not
as
strong
or
significant
as
those
identified in all countries (n = 178) and developed world
(n = 98). This may be due to small variances (low stand-
ard deviations) of cancer incidence variables, which may
reduce the covariance (correlation between family size
and cancer variable), compared to those in the devel-
oped world and all countries grouping.

 We must note an important strength of our study.
Cancer risk studies based on surveys of individual per-
sons have demonstrated a bias that is, in general, cancer
patients tend to exaggerate negative life events in com-
parison to people with average or positive attitudes [31].
The methods employed in this study may have excluded
this major bias because: 1) we used the objective meas-
urement (TFR), instead of individual subjective psycho-
logical feeling assuming that TFR may be the family
happiness index; 2) ecological study at population/group
level, rather than individual based research method was
adopted in this study. Ecological studies are based on ag-
gregated quantitative data, not on the interviews with in-
dividual patients, so they are often used to determine
the presence of effect of cancer risk-modifying factors in
advance of, or impossible to identify in other epidemio-
logical or laboratory approaches. Therefore, ecological
study may be a better method to conduct the study of
cancer incidence and its potential predictors, as cancer
is one of the relatively rare diseases.
Conclusions
Overall, this ecological study indicated that family size
was negatively correlated with cancer incidence at popu-
lation level. We also observed that family size correlated
negatively with cancer incidence in males significantly
stronger than with cancer incidence in females. Our re-
sults seem to suggest that it may be worthwhile further
examining correlations between family size and cancer
risk in males and females through the cohort and
case-control studies based on large samples.
