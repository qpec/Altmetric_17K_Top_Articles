Summary
Background Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus have substantial unmet medical need. Baricitinib is an oral 
selective Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2 inhibitor that we hypothesised might have therapeutic benefit in patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus.
Methods In this double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, 24-week phase 2 study, patients were 
recruited from 78 centres in 11 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a diagnosis of systemic 
lupus erythematosus, and had active disease involving skin or joints. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) to receive 
once-daily baricitinib 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of 
patients achieving resolution of arthritis or rash at week 24, as defined by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease 
Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K). Efficacy and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02708095.
Findings Between March 24, 2016, and April 27, 2017, 314 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo 
(n=105), baricitinib 2 mg (n=105), or baricitinib 4 mg (n=104). At week 24, resolution of SLEDAI-2K arthritis or rash 
was achieved by 70 (67%) of 104 patients receiving baricitinib 4 mg (odds ratio [OR] vs placebo 1·8, 95% CI 1·0–3·3; 
p=0·0414) and 61 (58%) of 105 patients receiving baricitinib 2 mg (OR 1·3, 0·7–2·3; p=0·39). Adverse events were 
reported in 68 (65%) patients in the placebo group, 75 (71%) patients in the baricitinib 2 mg group, and 76 (73%) 
patients in the baricitinib 4 mg group. Serious adverse events were reported in ten (10%) patients receiving 
baricitinib 4 mg, 11 (10%) receiving baricitinib 2 mg, and five (5%) receiving placebo; no deaths were reported. 
Serious infections were reported in six (6%) patients with baricitinib 4 mg, two (2%) with baricitinib 2 mg, and 
one (1%) with placebo.
Interpretation The baricitinib 4 mg dose, but not the 2 mg dose, significantly improved the signs and symptoms of 
active systemic lupus erythematosus in patients who were not adequately controlled despite standard of care therapy, 
with a safety profile consistent with previous studies of baricitinib. This study provides the foundation for future 
phase 3 trials of JAK1/2 inhibition with baricitinib as a new potential oral therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus.

Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem, chronic 
autoimmune disease characterised by the presence of 
antibodies directed at self-antigens, and broad immune 
dysregulation.1 It is believed that abnormalities of both 
the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, 
interconnected by a positive feedback loop, contribute to 
disease pathogenesis.2
Many key cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis 
of systemic lupus erythematosus are dependent on 
activation of Janus kinases (JAKs) for intracellular 
signalling.1,3,4 The JAK family of cytoplasmic protein 
tyrosine kinases mediates the signalling of several 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as type l inter-
ferons (JAK1/tyrosine kinase [TYK] 2), interleukin 6 
(JAK1/JAK2/TYK2), and interleukin 12 and interleukin 23 
(JAK2/TYK2).3 Baricitinib is an orally administered 
selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2,5 
which has been approved for the treatment of moderately 
to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in adults in over 
40 countries, including European countries, the USA, 
and Japan. This molecular mechanism of action suggests 
that baricitinib might inhibit cytokines central to the 
dysregulated innate and adaptive immune function 
observed in systemic lupus erythematosus.
We designed this international, double-blind, random-
ised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial to assess the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral baricitinib (2 mg or 
4 mg) once-daily in patients with active systemic lupus 
erythematosus, who were receiving standard background 
therapy.

11 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and South 
America. The study protocol is available from the 
sponsor.
Eligible participants were 18 years or older and had 
been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus 
at least 24 weeks before screening by fulfilling four 
or more of the revised American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR) criteria for classification of sys 
temic lupus erythe-
matosus, or the 2012 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification 
criteria.6–8 At baseline, patients were required to have 
a positive antinuclear antibody (HEp-2 titre ≥1:80), a 
positive 
anti-double-stranded 
DNA 
(anti-dsDNA; 
≥30 IU/mL), IgG INOVA QUANTA Lite SC ELISA 
(INOVA Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA), a Systemic 
Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 
(SLEDAI-2K) score of 4 or greater based on clinical 
manifestations, or active arthritis or rash as defined by 
the SLEDAI-2K. Study drug was added to existing 
stable background standard of care ther 
apy, which could 
be non-steroidal anti-inflam 
matory drugs, corticosteroids, 
a single antimalarial (such as chloroquine or hydroxy-
chloroquine), or a single immuno 
suppressant (such 
as azathioprine, metho 
trexate, or mycophenolate). The 
corticosteroid dose was limited to 20 mg or less of 
prednisone per day (or equivalent), and was required to 
be stable for 2 weeks before randomisation; increases in 
dose were not permitted after randomisation. Decreases 
in cor 
ticosteroid dose were permitted from baseline to 
week 16. No changes in corticosteroid dose were 
permitted between week 16 and week 24. No increases 
in antimalarials or immunosuppressants were allowed 
at any time. Key exclusion criteria included active 
severe lupus nephritis, active severe CNS lupus, recent 
clinically serious infection, and selected laboratory 
abnormalities. A full list of exclusion criteria are shown 
in the appendix.
The study was done in accordance with the ethical 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines. All investigation sites 
received approval from the appropriate authorised 
institutional review board or ethics committee. All 
patients provided written informed consent before the 
study-related procedures were done.
Randomisation and masking
We used a computer-generated random sequence to 
allocate patients (1:1:1) to placebo, baricitinib 2 mg, or 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed using the terms “systemic lupus 
erythematosus”, “treatment”, and “JAK inhibitor” for articles in 
English published up to March 1, 2016, regardless of article 
type. We considered previous clinical trials of investigational 
medication in systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as 
previous clinical trials of the Janus kinase (JAK)1/2 inhibitor, 
baricitinib, before doing this study. Current treatment 
regimens for the management of systemic lupus 
erythematosus have resulted in a reduction of morbidity and 
mortality over previous decades; however, many patients still 
have incompletely controlled disease and can progress to 
end-stage organ involvement. There are a small number of 
medications approved for the treatment of systemic lupus 
erythematosus and other medications are used off-label; 
collectively, these include antimalarials, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, corticosteroids, azathioprine, 
mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 
belimumab, and rituximab. Because of their limited efficacy, 
these drugs are often used in multiple combinations, rather 
than as single agents, resulting in added risk of toxicity. New 
treatment options with an acceptable safety profile that reduce 
disease activity, reduce flares, delay organ damage, and reduce 
the requirement for corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs are 
urgently needed for patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus. Additionally, the need for treatments that 
improve quality of life, including control of pain and fatigue, 
has been articulated by patients and physicians. Clinical and 
laboratory studies have showed a central role for JAK and 
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) in 
cytokine-mediated immune signalling and inflammation. This 
pathway includes JAK/STAT-mediated signalling through 
type 1 interferons, which have been shown to have an 
important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus 
erythematosus.
Added value of this study
In this phase 2 trial, baricitinib improved the signs and 
symptoms of active disease in patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus who were receiving standard background 
therapy. Baricitinib 4 mg treatment resulted in a greater 
proportion of patients achieving resolution of arthritis, as 
defined by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity 
Index-2000, than with placebo. The safety profile of baricitinib 
was consistent with other drugs used to treat active systemic 
lupus erythematosus.
Implications of all the available evidence
These findings support the evidence that JAK/STAT signalling 
could have a central role in the pathogenesis of systemic 
lupus erythematosus. To our knowledge, this is the first study 
to show clinical benefit of JAK inhibition in the treatment of 
systemic lupus erythematosus. This work provides the 
foundation for additional study of JAK1/2 inhibition with 
baricitinib as a potentially effective oral treatment option for 
active systemic lupus erythematosus in patients who have 
not achieved adequate disease control with available 
standard of care therapies.

baricitinib 4 mg. Patients were stratified according to 
disease severity (SLEDAI-2K score <10 or ≥10), anti-
dsDNA status (positive or negative), and region (USA, 
Europe, Asia, or rest of world). Patients and investigators 
were masked to allocation. Daily doses were provided 
at each visit in two bottles containing identical 
investigational product tablets supplied by Eli Lilly and 
Company. All study investigators remained masked until 
the week 24 analysis.
Procedures
All interventions were given orally. Patients were 
instructed to take one tablet from each bottle each day 
(one tablet of placebo, one tablet of study drug). Safety 
outcomes (clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and other 
safety assessments) and efficacy outcomes were assessed 
on scheduled study visits (baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 
16, 20, and 24) during the double-blind treatment period, 
as indicated in the protocol schedule of events. Patients 
were also assessed approximately 28 days after receiving 
their last dose of study drug.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients 
achieving resolution of arthritis or rash, as defined by the 
SLEDAI-2K, at week 24.
The proportion of patients achieving a Systemic 
Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) 
response at week 24 was a secondary objective. SRI-4 
response is defined as a reduction of at least 4 points 
from baseline in SLEDAI-2K score, no worsening in 
British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A or B 
disease activity scores (no new BILAG A score or no 
more than one new BILAG B score), and no worsening 
(defined as an increase of ≥0·3 points [10 mm] from 
baseline) in the Physician’s Global Assessment of 
Disease Activity (PGA). Other secondary endpoints 
were the proportion of patients achieving a reduction 
of 4 points or more from baseline in SLEDAI-2K score, 
and change from baseline in SLEDAI-2K total score 
and PGA at week 24. We analysed plasma baricitinib 
concen 
trations using a population pharmaco 
kinetic 
approach, to characterise the exposure response for 
SLEDAI-2K and SRI-4 across 24 weeks (data not 
shown). Exploratory assessments were change from 
baseline in 28-tender joint count and 28-swollen joint 
count, Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease 
Area and Severity Index (CLASI) activity score, and 
SLICC/ACR Damage index; risk of flares of any severity, 
and severe flares on the Safety of Estrogens in 
Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA)-
SLEDAI Flare Index (SSFI); and proportion of patients 
achieving Lupus Low Disease Activity Score (LLDAS). 
We also recorded corticosteroid doses and measured 
changes in serological markers, including anti-dsDNA 
and complement component (C) 3 and C4. We assessed 
change in the patient-reported outcomes Worst Joint 
Pain numeric rating scale (NRS), Worst Pain NRS, and 
Worst Fatigue NRS (appendix pp 20–23).
Incidence and severity of all adverse events were 
recorded between baseline and week 24, and up to 
30 days after treatment had ended, and the Quick 
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Rated-16 
was assessed. We used the National Institutes of 
Health Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) to describe laboratory abnormalities 
(version 4.03).
Statistical analysis
With approximately 100 patients per treatment group, 
this study had approximately 81% power to detect a 
difference of 20% between baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg 
and placebo for the primary endpoint. The expected 
treatment difference was based on an expected overall 
placebo response rate of 40% and an expected response 
rate of 60% with baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg. We calculated 
the power for planned sample size with a two-group 
χ² test of equal proportions, using nQuery Advisor 
(version 7
.0).
We analysed the primary, secondary, and exploratory 
endpoints according to the prespecified statistical 
analysis plan.
We made no multiplicity adjustments. We analysed 
efficacy and patient-reported outcomes (PGA, Worst 
Pain NRS, Worst Joint Pain NRS, Worst Fatigue NRS) in 
the modified intention-to-treat population, defined as all 
randomly assigned patients treated with at least one 
dose of study drug. We made treatment comparisons of 
categorical efficacy endpoints using logistic regression,

with treatment, region, baseline disease severity 
(SLEDAI-2K score <10 vs ≥10), and baseline anti-dsDNA 
status (positive or negative) in the model. We made 
treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy endpoints 
using pairwise comparisons in mixed models repeated 
measures for outcomes with multiple post-baseline 
values, or ANCOVA for outcomes with a single post-
baseline value. The mixed models repeated measures 
model included treatment, baseline score, baseline 
disease severity (SLEDAI-2K score <10 vs ≥10), baseline 
anti-dsDNA status (positive or negative), region, visit, 
and the interaction of treatment-by-visit as fixed 
factors. The ANCOVA model included treatment, 
baseline score, baseline disease severity (SLEDAI-2K 
score <10 vs ≥10), baseline anti-dsDNA status (positive 
or negative), and region as explanatory variables. We 
made treatment comparisons for the time to first 
systemic lupus erythematosus flare (SSFI) using a Cox 
proportional hazards model with treatment group, 
baseline disease severity (SLEDAI-2K score <10 vs ≥10), 
baseline anti-dsDNA status (positive or negative), and 
region fitted as explanatory variables. We assessed safety 
in patients who received at least one dose of study 
drug and who were not lost to follow-up before the 
first post-baseline visit. Adverse events were inclusive 
of the treatment period and up to 30 days after treat-
ment, and laboratory abnormality summaries included 
the treatment period and up 60 days after treatment. 
We used the Fisher exact test for all adverse events, 
discontinuation, and other categorical safety data. We 
analysed continuous safety data using ANCOVA, 
adjusting for baseline value and treatment. All analyses 
were assessed at a two-sided α of 0·05.
For categorical efficacy analyses, patients were con-
sidered non-responders at each visit if they were not 
responders at that visit; permanently discontinued study 
treatment at any time before that visit for any reason; 
required initiation or increase (from baseline) in dose 
of non-steroidal anti-inflamma 
tory drugs (for 30 or 
more consecutive days), cortico 
steroids, antimalarials, 
or immunosuppressants, after randomisation; or had 
missing data at that visit. No imputation was needed 
with mixed models repeated measures for analysing the 
continuous efficacy endpoints. This study is registered 
with ClincialTrials.gov, number NCT02708095.

Baseline demographics and disease activity were 
similar among groups (table 1; appendix). 294 (94%) 
patients were female and the mean age at baseline was 
44 years (SD 12). At baseline, the mean duration of 
systemic lupus erythematosus was 11 years (SD 9), with 
a mean SLICC/ACR index of 0·5 (SD 0·9). Patients 
had a baseline mean SLEDAI-2K score of 8·9 (SD 3), 
mean tender joint count of 8·3 (SD 6), and mean 
swollen joint count of 5·3 (SD 5). Patients had a mean 
baseline CLASI index score of 4·2 (SD 5). 187 (60%) 
patients had worsening of disease, as indicated by 
BILAG score criteria. At baseline, 230 (73%) patients 
were receiving corticosteroids, 222 (71%) were receiving 
antimalarials, and 142 (45%) were receiving immuno-
suppressants.
The proportion of patients who achieved resolution 
of arthritis or rash (SLEDAI-2K), the primary outcome, 
was significantly higher in the baricitinib 4 mg group 
than in the placebo group (70 [67%] of 104 patients; 
odds ratio [OR] vs placebo 1·8, 95% CI 1·0–3·3; 
p=0·0414; figure 2A, table 2). There was also 
improvement in the primary outcome measure for the 
baricitinib 2 mg group (61 [58%] of 105 patients; 
OR 1·3, 95% CI 0·7–2·3; p=0·39), but this was not 
statistically significant. The proportion of patients 
achieving an SRI-4 response at week 24 was higher in 
the baricitinib 4 mg group than in the placebo group 
(67 [64%] patients; OR 2·0, 95% CI 1·2–3·6; p=0·0151); 
the result did not reach significance for baricitinib 
2 mg (54 [51%] patients; OR 1·3, 95% CI 0·7–2·2; 
p=0·44; figure 2, table 2). The achievement of SRI-4 at 
week 24 was primarily driven by the SLEDAI-2K 
component (67 [64%] patients in the baricitinib 4 mg 
group, OR vs placebo 2·0, 95% CI 1·1–3·5, p=0·0220; 
55 [52%] patients in the baricitinib 2 mg group, 1·2, 
0·7–2·2, p=0·45; table 2). For the other secondary 
endpoints, there was a significant decrease in PGA at 
week 24 for patients who received baricitinib 4 mg 
versus placebo; results were not significant for the 
baricitinib 2 mg group (table 2, figure 2). Pharma-
cokinetic and pharma 
codynamic models showed that 
the majority of patients in the baricitinib 4 mg

group had exposure at the plateau of the curve (data 
not shown).
There were some improvements in exploratory 
outcomes, including patient-reported outcomes, with 
baricitinib treatment. A greater proportion of patients 
attained LLDAS with baricitinib 4 mg than with placebo 
at week 24 (p=0·0391); the result did not reach 
significance for baricitinib 2 mg (table 2). A decreased 
risk of any flare, as measured by the SSFI, was observed 
for patients receiving baricitinib 4 mg compared 
with placebo at week 24 (p=0·0193); the result did not 
reach significance for baricitinib 2 mg (table 2, 
figure 3). There were significant improvements in 
28-tender joint count (p=0·0377), Worst Joint Pain NRS 
(p=0·0157), and Worst Pain NRS (p=0·0403) for 
patients receiving baricitinib 4 mg compared with 
those receiving placebo at week 24 (table 2, figure 3; 
appendix). Treatment with baricitinib 4 mg did not 
result in significant improve 
ments at week 24 in other 
exploratory assessments. Results of the exploratory 
analyses were not significant for the baricitinib 2 mg 
group compared with placebo at week 24, for most 
measures (table 2).
Rates of treatment discontinuation because of adverse 
events are shown in table 3. Serious adverse events 
were reported in five (5%) patients receiving placebo, 
11 (10%) patients receiving baricitinib 2 mg, and 
ten (10%) patients receiving baricitinib 4 mg (table 3, 
appendix). There were no deaths, malignancies, or 
major adverse cardiovascular events in the study. One 
serious adverse event of deep-vein thrombosis was 
reported in the baricitinib 4 mg group, 46 days after the 
patient’s first dose of baricitinib, in a patient with 
antiphospholipid antibodies (table 3). There were more 
serious infections reported in the baricitinib 4 mg 
group (six [6%] patients) than in the 2 mg group

(two [2%] patients) or placebo group (one [1%] patient; 
table 3, appendix). There were no cases of serious 
or multi 
dermatomal herpes zoster virus infection or 
opportunistic infection, and no reports of tuberculosis. 
There was one occurrence of non-serious herpes zoster 
virus infection in the placebo group, none in the 
baricitinib 2 mg group, and one in the baricitinib 
4 mg group. 
Mean changes from baseline and CTCAE grade 
increases for selected laboratory analytes from baseline 
to week 24 are shown in the appendix. There were 
modest dose-associated decreases in haemoglobin and 
neutrophil concentrations. There were early increases 
in lymphocyte concentration with baricitinib treatment, 
but lymphocytes returned to baseline concentrations by 
week 24. At week 12, there were statistically significant 
dose-associated increases in platelet counts, creatine 
phosphokinase, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol 
(appendix). There were modest dose-associated inc-
reases in triglyceride concentrations in the baricitinib 
groups. There were no clinically meaningful differences 
in laboratory abnormalities. Laboratory changes were 
generally of low grade and consistent with changes 
observed for other conditions,9–14 and four led to 
discontinuation of study drug (n=2 in baricitinib 2 mg 
and n=2 in baricitinib 4 mg).
Discussion
Use of 4 mg daily oral baricitinib treatment, in addition 
to standard of care therapy, was superior to placebo plus 
standard of care in improving signs and symptoms of 
active systemic lupus erythematosus.
We chose the primary objective, resolution of arthritis 
or rash by SLEDAI-2K, for this phase 2 trial because 
arthritis and rash are among the most common 
manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus and are 
the two most frequent clinical manifestations at entry 
in recent clinical trials of extra-renal systemic lupus 
erythematosus. The SLEDAI-2K organ domain scoring 
is a validated, widely used outcome measure for the 
study of systemic lupus erythematosus.15,16 Arthritis, as 
well as musculoskeletal pain, is a prominent symptom 
in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and 
improvement in musculoskeletal symptoms, assessed 
with several measures, is associated with improvement in 
quality of life.17–20 Treatment with 4 mg baricitinib showed,

by physician assessment, improve 
ment in the proportion 
of patients with arthritis, as measured using the 
SLEDAI-2K arthritis organ domain score (data not 
shown), and improvement in the proportion with joint 
tenderness, as measured by 28-joint examination. 
Treatment with 4 mg baricitinib also showed a significant 
reduction in the proportion of patients with Worst Joint 
Pain and Worst Pain when compared with placebo. 
In this phase 2 study, it was also important to bench 
mark 
improvement with an established composite endpoint, 
SRI-4, which assesses overall disease activity improvement 
with a global disease index. SRI-4 is a validated, widely 
accepted clinical trial and global regulatory endpoint for 
studies of systemic lupus erythematosus.21 Additional 
results supporting the findings for the primary endpoint 
were the significant improvements in SRI-4 for patients 
in the baricitinib 4 mg group, as well as other important 
general measures of disease activity, such as PGA, 
LLDAS, SSFI flares, and patient-reported outcomes. 
Baricitinib 2 mg did not show any significant differences 
from placebo across the primary and secondary efficacy 
objectives studied at week 24, although there were 
improvements compared with placebo.
There were no significant improvements in the signs 
or symptoms of skin disease, whether measured using 
proportions of patients meeting the SLEDAI-2K muco-
cutaneous organ domain score (data not shown) or using 
the CLASI activity score for severity, when comparing 
placebo with baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg. Although the 
percentage of patients at baseline with mucocutaneous 
disease activity, measured by SLEDAI-2K, was high 
(84%), the overall activity score for severity, as measured 
by CLASI, was low. Currently, there are limited data 
about the use of CLASI in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials in 
systemic lupus erythematosus; hence, the use of CLASI 
remains uncertain. A mean baseline CLASI activity score 
of 4·2, as seen in this study, might be inadequate to 
discern a difference between placebo and treatment with 
baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg, and the study was not powered 
to observe small changes in CLASI. Notably, however, 
JAK inhibitors have been reported to have positive effects 
on skin in several dermatological conditions including 
atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, graft-versus-host disease, 
and alopecia areata, and there remains reason to 
anticipate JAK inhibitors could have potential efficacy in 
treating the mucocutaneous features of systemic lupus 
erythematosus.3,13,14,22
The safety profile of baricitinib in patients with active 
systemic lupus erythematosus receiving standard of 
care treatment was consistent with published findings 
in patients receiving baricitinib in other studies. No 
notable safety observations emerged, compared with 
results 
from 
studies 
of 
baricitinib 
for 
other 
conditions.9–14 Compared with placebo, baricitinib 
treatment was associated with a higher proportion of 
patients who discontinued study treatment because of 
adverse events, and serious adverse events were more 
frequent with baricitinib treatment. However in this 
study, serious infection rates were more frequent with 
baricitinib 4 mg (6%) than with baricitinib 2 mg (2%) or 
placebo (1%). The serious infection rate with baricitinib 
4 mg was similar to that reported in other trials, such as 
those for belimumab, which reported 5% for the 
placebo plus standard of care arm, and 6% for 
belimumab.23 The rate of serious infections might be 
affected by the frequent use of potent immune-
modifying standard of care medication as background 
therapy. There were no reports of death, malignancies, 
major adverse cardiovascular events, tuberculosis, or 
serious herpes zoster.
The occurrence of thrombosis with JAK inhibition is 
an area of increased attention and debate. There was a 
single episode of deep-vein thrombosis in this study, 
which occurred in a patient receiving baricitinib 4 mg, 
who was positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. It is 
noteworthy that only one event was observed in the trial, 
despite a study population in which nearly 30% of 
patients had antiphospholipid antibodies (data not 
shown). No patients were excluded from the study based 
on risk factors, including history of thrombosis (unless 
the occurrence was recent—ie, within the previous 
24 weeks).
Although there were no clinically meaningful 
differences in laboratory abnormalities, baricitinib 
treatment resulted in modest dose-associated decreases 
in haemoglobin neutrophil, and triglyceride concen-
trations, and statistically significant increases in platelet 
counts, concentrations of creatine phosphokinase, HDL 
cholesterol, and total cholesterol.
There are limitations to the conclusions that can be 
drawn from this study. Notably, this trial is among few 
other phase 2 studies that have shown a positive 
outcome within 24 weeks.24,25 However, this timeframe 
limited the ability to assess long-term outcomes and 
damage. Further improvements in efficacy might be 
seen in a 52-week study. Patients were allowed to

continue existing stable background standard of care 
therapy, including corticosteroids, and while baseline 
standard of care use was balanced across groups, 
background therapy could potentially confound the 
results and contribute to the high placebo response rate. 
This is a recurring issue in trials for systemic lupus 
erythematosus,26 but despite this confounder, the results 
were positive.
Despite treatment advances, systemic lupus erythema-
tosus remains a disease with unacceptable morbidity 
and mortality.27 Existing treatments can be associated 
with incomplete efficacy or substantial toxicity.28 Since 
baricitinib has selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2,5 it could 
inhibit pathways that have been implicated as central to 
the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, and 
we hypothesised that baricitinib could have clinical 
benefit in active systemic lupus erythematosus. We 
found that once-daily baricitinib 4 mg was associated 
with significant clinical improvements compared with 
placebo. Baricitinib treatment was not associated with 
any notable safety findings compared with results 
from baricitinib studies for other conditions.9-14 These 
findings support further study of baricitinib as a 
potential therapy for patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus.
