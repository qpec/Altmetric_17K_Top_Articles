Objective
To evaluate the sexual function response to 30 weeks’
treatment with long-acting testosterone undecanoate (TU) or
placebo in 199 men with type 2 diabetes and either severe or
mild hypogonadism (HG).
Patients and Methods
Men with HG were identified from seven primary care type 2
diabetes registers. A 30-week randomized placebo-controlled
study of TU was carried out in 199 of these men (placebo,
n = 107, TU, n = 92). The patient-reported outcome measure
was the 15-item International Index of Erectile Function
score. Men completing the study (n=189) were stratified,
firstly, by baseline total testosterone (TT) or free testosterone
(FT) into mild HG (TT 8.1–12 nmol/L or FT 0.18–
0.25 nmol/L) and severe HG groups (TT ≤8 nmol/L and FT
≤0.18 nmol/L), and secondly, by intervention (placebo or
TU), thereby creating four groups: mild HG/placebo; mild
HG/TU; severe HG/placebo and severe HG/TU.
Statistical Analysis
Changes in sexual function score (a secondary outcome of the
study) at each visit within group (from baseline) and between
groups (TU vs placebo) at each assessment (6, 18 and
30 weeks) were compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank and
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, respectively.
Results
Significant improvement in erectile function was evident only
in the severe HG group after 30 weeks of TU treatment; this
finding persisted when TU was compared with placebo.
Intercourse satisfaction and sexual desire scores were also
improved at 6, 18 and 30 weeks in the severe HG group after
TU treatment; this increase in scores was also evident when
compared with placebo. TU did not appear to alter orgasmic
function significantly in any of the patient groups.
Conclusions
The present study suggests that benefit in sexual symptoms
after TU treatment is evident principally in patients with HG
with TT levels ≤8 nmol/L and FT levels ≤0.18 nmol/L. We
also suggest that 30 weeks of treatment is necessary before
evaluating improvement in erectile function.

Introduction
Hypogonadism (HG) is characterized by reduced serum
testosterone levels with associated symptoms. Although
guidelines on the management of HG do not recommend
routine population screening, they strongly endorse
testosterone measurement in men with sexual dysfunction
and those at high risk of HG, such as men with type 2
diabetes (T2DM) [1,2]. A broad consensus exists that men
with a total testosterone (TT) level <8 nmol/L or free
testosterone (FT) level <0.18 nmol/L may benefit from
testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) [1,2]. Furthermore, it
is suggested that individuals with TT levels of 8–12 nmol/L
and/or FT levels 0.18–0.25 nmol/L be considered for a 3–6-
month trial of TRT, depending on symptom severity [1–3];
however, there is no consensus as to which symptoms are

 important or how benefit after TRT should be assessed.
Zitzmann et al. [3] described the levels at which symptoms
appear with falling TT level, concluding that sexual desire
may decline at levels ≤15 nmol/L, while erectile function is
affected at levels ≤8 nmol/L. Our hypothesis was that, if
erectile dysfunction (ED) was associated with TT <8 nmol/L,
then TRT would only benefit men with baseline levels
<8 nmol/L (severe HG). Further, other domains of sexual
function might improve with treatment at baseline levels of
8–12 nmol/L (mild HG).
The BLAST study (acronym derived from patient recruiting
in the Midlands cities and towns of Birmingham, Lichfield,
Atherstone, Sutton Coldfield and Tamworth, UK) carried out
by our group was the first double-blind placebo-controlled
intervention study in a primary care population with T2DM,
describing the effects of long-acting testosterone undecanoate
(TU) 1 000 mg on metabolic variables [4]. The objectives of
the present study were to describe the magnitude, time to
onset and clinical significance of changes in sexual function
scores that occur after TU therapy. The primary outcome was
change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline
(published elsewhere), with a secondary outcome being
change in sexual function [4].
Subjects and Methods
The BLAST study, a 30-week randomized double-blind
placebo-controlled multicentre study was conducted at seven
midland primary care centres in England between September
2008 and June 2012 [4]. The 30-week duration was chosen
because guidelines recommend a TRT trial period of 3–
6 months in men with HG [1,2]. The study was conducted in
accordance with the revised guidelines of the World Medical
Association Declaration of Helsinki (2000) and national and
local UK regulatory requirements (Multicentre Research
Ethics Committee approval 08/H1208/30).
After excluding men in the primary care practice registers
considered to be of too advanced age or too frail and those
with associated serious comorbid conditions, 550 men were
approached to be pre-screened with a morning TT level
(08:00–11:00 h) and 488 gave written informed consent for
pre-screening. The major barrier was the requirement to
complete regular sexual function questionnaires, as diabetes
nurses expressed discomfort at regularly raising the topic.
Men aged 18–80 years were eligible to enter the study after
discussion with their GP, the T2DM population having been
screened at routine diabetes visits in accordance with national
guidelines [5]. Inclusion criteria for the BLAST intervention
study were men aged 18–80 years with an initial finding of
either TT level 8.1–12 nmol/L or FT level 0.18–0.25 nmol/L
(mild HG group) or TT level ≤8.0 nmol/L or 0.18 nmol/L or
FT level ≤0.18 nmol/L (severe HG group), according to the
current European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines
[1], with symptoms of HG defined according to the Aging
Male Symptom scale. Exclusion criteria included men
considered too frail for TRT, previous TRT, abnormal DRE,
PSA >4 lg/L, haematocrit >0.50 L/L, history of prostate,
breast or hepatic carcinoma and other serious comorbidities.
Anticoagulation therapy was not allowed, and physicians were
instructed, where possible, to avoid changes in diabetes,
antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy throughout the
30 weeks of the study. Adverse events (AEs) were elicited
from the patient at each visit by a non-leading question. At
visit 2, all men were assessed for eligibility on the basis of the
screening and baseline TT and FT measurements (two
measurements taken at least 6 weeks apart). If eligible on the
basis of two abnormal levels TU 1 000 mg (or matched
placebo) was given at visit 2. Exercise and dietary advice
using standard literature issued by NHS diabetes was also
administered at visit 2.
Of the 550 men pre-screened (blood for TT measurement
taken between 08:00 and 11:00 h), 488 men provided written
informed consent and 211 of them had TT ≤12 nmol/L and/
or FT ≤0.25 nmol/L (Fig. 1). Elevated LH levels were found
in 3% of men (n = 7), suggesting primary HG. LH levels were
within the normal range in the remainder (n = 10). On this
basis LH was not included in baseline study measurements.
A total of 11 men were excluded at this stage (elevated PSA,
n = 10; atrial fibrillation, n = 1) and recruitment was closed
when the target of 200 men was reached. One man withdrew
consent at the baseline attendance, hence, 199 men were
randomized to either TU or placebo administration (TU,
n = 92, placebo, n = 107) at 0, 6 and 18 weeks. Of these, 189
(TU, n = 86; placebo, n = 103) completed the 30 weeks
(reasons for non-completion and details of AEs are provided
in Fig. 1 and the Results section). For the present analysis,
the TU and placebo groups were further stratified by TT and
FT levels into mild HG (TT 8.1–12 nmol/L or FT 0.181–
0.25 nmol/L) and severe HG (TT ≤8.0 nmol/L or FT
≤0.18 nmol/L), based on the current EAU guidelines [1]. The
four groups studied were: mild HG/placebo, n = 51; mild
HG/TU, n =56; severe HG/placebo, n = 52; and severe HG/
TU, n = 30.
The validated, full 15-item International Index of Erectile
Function (IIEF) questionnaire was used to assess domains of
sexual function (erectile function, intercourse satisfaction,
orgasmic function and sexual desire) [6].
Testosterone Treatment Regime
Subjects were randomized to receive either TU 1 000 mg at
weeks 0, 6 and 18, administered over 5 min into the right or
left upper outer buttock, or matching placebo. The study
medication was prepared by the manufacturer of TU (Nebido
Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) and randomized in

Testosterone undeanoate in men with type 2 diabetes and hypogonadism
 blocks according to the standard processes used throughout
the drug development programme. The placebo was an
analogue of the same appearance, but without any active
substance, containing the vehicle castor oil and benzyl
benzoate. The long-acting preparation achieves maximum
serum concentration of 24 and 45 nmol/L after 14 and 7
days, respectively, with an estimated half-life of 53 days [7].
After repeated injections of 1 000 mg, stable therapeutic
serum TT levels over approximately three to five injections
with Cmax and Cmin values at steady state between 42 and
17 nmol/L were achieved [7]. Identification of the trial
medication was by numbered sealed packages, and each
subject was assigned to the next lowest numbered sealed
package. The code breaks were retained by the study
statisticians until the last man completed the study and the
codes were not broken until the last study procedure was
carried out and databases were locked. The dose interval was
in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended interval
and was fixed at 12 weeks between doses two and three
because of the blinded nature of the study.
Laboratory Testing
Fasting blood samples were taken at screening visits between
8:00 and 11:00 h, at �2 (baseline), 6, 18 and 30 weeks for
measurement of haematocrit, HbA1c and serum TT, sex
hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and PSA levels. All
laboratory work was carried out at the Heart of England
Foundation NHS Trust Laboratories. TT level was measured
using a common platform immunoassay which had been
validated against mass spectrometry [8]. SHBG, albumin and
total PSA levels were measured in serum using a Roche
Modular automated analyser (Roche Diagnostics, Burgess
Hill, UK). FT level was estimated using an online calculator,
based on the equations of Vermeulen et al. [9].
Statistical Analysis
The planned sample size of 100 patients per group has an
80% chance of showing a statistically significant treatment
difference if the true treatment difference in HbA1c is 0.4%.
This calculation is based on a standard deviation of 1%, a
significance level of 5% (two-sided), and analysis of
covariance, with HbA1c at baseline as the covariate. An
HbA1c change of 0.4% was clinically accepted as significant
and a (baseline corrected-) standard deviation of 1% was
derived from previous trials.
The safety assessment was to comprise all men recruited
unless study medication was known not to have been taken,

 and the intention-to-treat population was to comprise all
subjects in the safety population who provided efficacy data.
The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c and
secondary endpoints included changes in IIEF scores. No
adjustment was made for multiple significance testing, as the
secondary outcome endpoints were regarded as exploratory.
Missing values were not replaced.
Baseline differences in characteristics between the stratified
groups (mild HG/placebo, mild HG/TU, severe HG/placebo
and severe HG/TU) were studied using the unpaired t-test
(continuous variables) and Wilcoxon rank-sum test (IIEF
sexual function ordinal scores). Changes in sexual function
scores from baseline within each group were assessed by
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The effect of TU (vs placebo) on
change in IIEF sexual function scores from baseline in the
men with mild HG or severe HG was assessed by Wilcoxon
rank-sum test. An exploratory linear regression analysis was
carried out to compare erectile function scores in the mild
HG/TU vs mild HG/placebo and severe HG/TU vs severe
HG/placebo groups at 6, 18 and 30 weeks. The regression
model included baseline sexual function scores and age as
independent variables, as in many cases these were
independently associated with the outcome. We were aware
that the outcome was ordinal, restricted and not a continuous
variable; however, because the scale was wide (0–30) and had
been used in a similar way in other studies investigating
erectile function, it was felt that this exploratory analysis was
some value. All analyses in this report were conducted using
STATA software version 8 (College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Baseline Data
Tables 1 and 2 show the baseline characteristics of the four
groups: mild HG/placebo; mild HG/TU; severe HG/placebo;
and severe HG/TU. As previously reported, significant
differences were observed between the mild HG (mild HG/
placebo and mild HG/TU) and severe HG (severe HG/
placebo and severe HG/TU) groups in body mass index
(BMI), weight and waist circumference (unpaired t-test) and
sexual function scores (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) [4]. Severe
HG was associated with higher BMI, greater weight and
larger waist circumference compared with the mild HG
cohort. All four IIEF domain scores studied were lower in
men with severe HG [4]. No differences in baseline IIEF
scores were seen between the men receiving TU and those
receiving placebo in either the mild HG or the severe HG
group (Table 2: Wilcoxon rank-sum test). There were fewer
men in the severe HG/TU group (n = 30) than in the severe
HG/placebo group (n = 52), despite randomization.
Oral diabetes medication was taken by 150 men: metformin,
n = 132, gliclazide, n = 47; tolbutamide, n = 1; pioglitazone,
n = 6; sitagliptin, n = 3; insulin, n = 45; and exenatide, n = 1.
Statins were taken by 76.4%, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors by 53%, angiotensin receptor blockers by 20.5%,
calcium channel blockers by 23%, b-blockers by 14.7% and
nitrates by 9% of the men, with no significant differences
among the groups. The number of men being prescribed
phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors at baseline was as
follows: mild HG/TU, n = 9; mild HG/placebo, n = 8; severe
HG/TU, n = 1; and severe HG/placebo, n = 8.
Longitudinal Within-Group Changes in Sexual
Function Scores
Table 2 shows sexual function scores at baseline, 6, 18 and
30 weeks in each of the groups. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test
was carried out to assess improvements in sexual function in
each of the groups compared with the baseline scores. Erectile
function only significantly improved in the severe HG/TU
group after 30 weeks (P = 0.038). Intercourse satisfaction
worsened in the severe HG/placebo group (6 weeks: P =
0.030, 18 weeks: P = 0.008, 30 weeks: P = 0.004), whilst it

Testosterone undeanoate in men with type 2 diabetes and hypogonadism
 improved in the severe HG/TU group (6 weeks: P = 0.027,
18 weeks: P = 0.010, 30 weeks: P = 0.050) compared with
baseline. Orgasmic function did not significantly change in
any of the groups. Sexual desire only significantly improved
in the severe HG/TU group (6 weeks: P = 0.004, 18 weeks:
P = 0.001, 30 weeks: P < 0.001). In the other groups
significant change in sexual symptoms was evident at certain
time points, but, no consistent pattern of change emerged
(Table 2).
Changes in Sexual Function Scores Between
Testosterone Undecanoate and Placebo
Treatments at Different Time Points
Changes in IIEF sexual function scores (from baseline values)
at 6, 18 and 30 weeks after TU and placebo treatment in men
with mild HG and severe HG are shown in Fig. 2A–H.
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were carried out to determine
whether TU significantly changed sexual function scores
compared with placebo.
Changes in erectile function, intercourse satisfaction and
orgasmic function scores (from baseline) were no different
after TU treatment compared with placebo at any of the time
points in men with mild HG (Fig. 2A, C and E). Erectile
function in men with severe HG was significantly higher
(mean erectile function score was 5.8 points greater than the
placebo counterparts) after 30 weeks (P = 0.0036) of TU
treatment (Fig. 2B). Similarly, a linear regression analyses was
carried out to study the effects of TU (vs placebo) on erectile
function at 6, 18 and 30 weeks, in the mild HG/TU and
severe HG/TU groups, the analysis corrected for baseline
erectile function and age at in initial visit. Significant
improvement was seen in the severe HG/TU group at 6
(P = 0.042), 18 (P = 0.005) and 30 (P = 0.003) weeks, but not
in the mild HG/TU group. Baseline erectile function scores
were significant in all the analyses.
Intercourse satisfaction after TU was significantly greater
compared with placebo at 6 (P = 0.002), 18 (P < 0.001) and
30 (P = 0.005) weeks in the severe HG/TU group (Fig. 2D),

 but no significant treatment benefit appeared regarding
orgasmic function in the severe HG/TU group (Fig. 2F).
Change in sexual desire was higher in the men with mild HG
after TU compared with placebo at 18 (P = 0.031) and 30
(P = 0.05) weeks (Fig. 2G). The corresponding change was
greater in the severe HG/TU group, the difference being
significant at 6 (P = 0.0002), 18 (P < 0.001) and 30
(P < 0.001) weeks (Fig. 2H).
Adverse Events
There were four serious AEs: one man in each group
developed bowel malignancy, considered unrelated to
treatment, one man in the placebo group died from
postoperative septicaemia after elective knee replacement and
one man in the placebo group developed prostate cancer
without a rise in PSA level, diagnosed by DRE. Of the six
men who withdrew consent, only one (placebo) was because
of injection-related pain. The mean (range) PSA level
increased from 1.2 (0.14–4.23) lg/L at baseline to 1.5
(0.32–4.6) lg/L at 30 weeks in the severe HG/TU group
(paired t-test, P = 0.002), but, not in the other groups. There
was a significant rise in haematocrit within the normal range
(43.5% at baseline to 45.6% after 30 weeks) in the severe HG/
TU group (paired t-test, P = 0.013). No change in
haematocrit was observed in the other groups.
In the TU group (n = 86), there were 116 AEs, 19 possibly
treatment-related and two (injection pain) definitely

Testosterone undeanoate in men with type 2 diabetes and hypogonadism
 treatment-related. In the placebo group (n = 103), there were
129 AEs, 31 possibly treatment-related with three (injection
pain) considered definite.
Discussion
Changes in IIEF sexual function scores after TU treatment, a
secondary endpoint of the BLAST study, are reported in the
present paper. We analysed the changes in sexual function
scores after TU or placebo administration, longitudinally
within each of the groups, and also compared change in
sexual function scores between TU and placebo. It appears
that benefit in erectile function was evident only in the severe
HG/TU group after 30 weeks; this finding was also present
when TU was compared with placebo. Intercourse satisfaction
and sexual desire scores were also seen to improve in the
severe HG/TU group at 6, 18 and 30 weeks; this increase in
scores was also evident when compared with placebo.
Interestingly, intercourse satisfaction and sexual desire scores
often decreased in mild and severe HG/placebo groups at
several time points, often reaching statistical significance,
hence, sexual function scores in TU-treated men when
compared with placebo-treated men were often greater than
the within-group analysis. Thus, all the analyses indicated
that TU was effective in men with severe HG, with 30 weeks
of treatment required before a significant change in erectile
function was reached.
In an earlier publication, we reported that HG was only
significantly associated with ED in men with TT levels
≤8 nmol/L (severe HG). Earlier BLAST studies confirmed the
high prevalence of ED in the T2DM population (77%) with
severe ED (assessed by IIEF) observed at baseline in >60% of
the men with severe HG [4]. This supports the Endocrine

 Society’s view that the influence of HG on sexual function
should be considered independently of the vascular and
neuropathic burden associated with T2DM [1]. They stressed
the importance of measuring testosterone levels in men with
T2DM and those with sexual dysfunction, stopping short of
recommending screening for HG in T2DM [1]. The present
findings of high prevalence of ED and HG in T2DM and the
significant impact of TRT would suggest that routine
screening for HG in men with T2DM and ED is clinically
indicated. The results support those of Zitzmann et al. [3],
who studied 433 men with HG, reporting that sexual desire
levels declined with TT levels <15 nmol/L and that erectile
function declined with TT <8 nmol/L.
We found that benefits with regard to erectile function,
intercourse satisfaction and orgasmic function with TRT were
only likely to be seen in patients with severe HG, whereas
prompt improvements in sexual desire were likely to be seen
in both those with mild HG and those with severe HG.
Studies have suggested that ~22 and 35% of men with T2DM
will fall into the severe HG and mild HG groups, respectively
[10,11]. Merging of the two groups (mild HG and severe HG)
in clinical studies, may have led to the authors concluding
that the effects of TRT on sexual function were ‘variable’ or
‘inconclusive’. Grossmann et al. [12] studied the effect of
40 weeks of TU treatment on sexual function in 88 men with
T2DM, and concluded that these were insignificant; however,
only 10 men in that study had baseline TT <8 nmol/L.
Corona et al. [13] conducted a meta-analysis of randomized
controlled trials on HG and sexual function and concluded
that TRT significantly improved desire, erectile function,
intercourse frequency and orgasm (all P = 0.001).
The Testosterone trial recently reported on 790 men with HG
(cut-off 275 ng/dL or ~10 nmol/L) aged ≥65 years, treated for
12 months and randomized to either 1% testosterone gel or
placebo [14]. A total of 51 085 men were screened, to arrive
at 790 men for the trial. There were 30% with diabetes and
60% with hypertension, with no mention of PDE5 inhibitor
use over the 12 months. A total of 459 men enrolled in the
sexual function arm and significant improvement was found,
as assessed by the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning
in Men-II and 2.64 points on the erectile function domain of
the IIEF. The authors concluded that the erectile function
response was mild and less than would be expected with
PDE5 inhibitors; however, The P values suggest that their
conclusions should be reconsidered. Firstly, they merged all
men with TT levels <275 ng/dL (10 nmol/L), whereas the
present results suggest that responses would have been seen
only in those with TT ≤8 nmol/L, which may have
constituted only ~50% of their cohort based on our findings
that most men with HG were in the mild group. An analysis
using a threshold of 8 nmol/L, based on our findings, may
have led to different conclusions. Studies with PDE5
inhibitors were conducted on men, presenting with a wish to
have ED treated and fulfilling run-in criteria for a minimum
number of attempts. In the present cohort and in the
Testosterone trial, men were included who were not
necessarily attempting intercourse at all, as the global effect of
testosterone on sexual function, particularly desire was being
evaluated. The referenced study in the Testosterone trial was
actually a compilation of sildenafil studies, from which men
with untreated HG or poorly controlled diabetes had been
excluded, based on baseline screening [15]. As the baseline
erectile function score in the Testosterone trial was 8, similar
to BLAST. A more logical conclusion would have been that
men with severe HG would require testosterone therapy plus
a PDE5 inhibitor to achieve responses approaching normal
sexual function. We believe that suggesting that treatment of
these men is an either/or choice is misleading. Results from
BLAST are more likely to reflect everyday practice than the
highly selected group involved in the Testosterone trial.
This raises the important question as to ‘what constitutes
meaningful improvement’ in IIEF scores. Rosen et al. [16]
addressed this issue, reviewing studies of PDE5 inhibitors in
ED, concluding that an improvement of seven points in
erectile function score was clinically meaningful in severe ED
(erectile function score: 6–10), five in mild/moderate (erectile
function:11–21) and two in mild ED (erectile function: 22–
25). We found a treatment effect (vs placebo) of 5.8 points
for our severe HG cohort at 30 weeks, with mean baseline
IIEF of ≤10 constituting a clinically meaningful response. In
patients with erectile function scores of 6–10 the mean
difference after TU was 9.0 points.
Lifestyle modification has been suggested as frontline therapy
in men with severe HG in some guidelines [1,2]; however,
evidence suggests that these even after several years, have
little impact on sexual function in men with T2DM [17].
Response to PDE5 inhibitors is often disappointing in men
with T2DM with, at best, 55% achieving a five-point erectile
function improvement, even after protocols excluded
untreated HG and poorly controlled diabetes [15]. The
present analysis suggests that 30 weeks of TRT is required to
establish significant benefit in erectile function in men with
severe HG and that additional ED-specific therapy is likely to
be required to achieve near-normal erectile function scores.
Long-term registry studies suggest that sexual function
continues to improve with prolonged use of long-acting TU
with symptoms recurring when therapy is interrupted [18].
Gan et al. [19] and Handelsman et al. [20] highlighted the
increase in blood testing and prescribing costs over the past
10 years, suggesting that men are being unnecessarily treated
as a result of industry advertising, despite several publications
linking HG with increased mortality and development of
T2DM [21–25]. Interestingly, our group recently showed TU
therapy to be associated with significantly reduced mortality
in men with T2DM and TT <12 nmol/L [25]. Early use of

Testosterone undeanoate in men with type 2 diabetes and hypogonadism
 TRT in men with ED is suggested by guidelines, especially in
those failing to respond to PDE5 inhibitors [1,2,26]. In recent
years, targeted screening of sexual dysfunction in T2DM,
consistent with NICE guidance [5], has inevitably increased
HG detection and Testosterone prescribing [27], although
testosterone therapy is associated with impaired
spermatogenesis in placebo-controlled studies [28]. The
present results strongly suggest that TU therapy in men with
TT ≤8 nmol/L will probably see significant improvement in
sexual function when treated for up to 30 weeks.
This is the first published double-blind placebo-controlled
study of long-acting TU on sexual function exclusively in
men with T2DM. Its strengths include the representative
nature of this group, who were screened from complete
primary care databases and therefore more like to reflect the
general community. High compliance and low withdrawal
rates were probably related to the use of long-acting
injections administered in a familiar healthcare environment.
A limitation was the smaller number of men in the severe
HG/TU group (n = 30) vs the severe HG/placebo group
(n = 52), which occurred by chance during the randomization
process.
In conclusion, the present study endorses the view of the
Endocrine Society that the burden of HG-related sexual
dysfunction in men is evident at TT levels ≤8 nmol/L. TU
produced significant benefit in all the domains of sexual
function that we studied in men with TT levels ≤8 nmol/L.
By contrast, only sexual desire improved significantly with
TRT in those with mild HG. The present findings also
suggest that therapeutic trials of TRT, especially with TU,
should be of >30 weeks’ duration, not 3 months as suggested
by some guidelines.
