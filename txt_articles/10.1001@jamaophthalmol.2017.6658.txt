IMPORTANCE Mice with oxygen-induced retinopathy fed matched diets except for ω-3
long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) vs ω-6 LC-PUFAs demonstrate relative
antiangiogenic and neuroprotective associations of ω-3 LC-PUFAs. However, supplementing
preterm infants with LC-PUFAs has been inconsistent in reducing major preterm morbidities.
However, few studies measured serum lipid levels after supplementation.
OBJECTIVE To examine the associated risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) from the
levels of circulating ω-3 and ω-6 LC-PUFAs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal clinical study was a further analysis of
serum lipid levels from a randomized controlled trial cohort of 90 infants born at gestational
age (GA) less than 28 weeks. From April 4, 2013, to September 22, 2015, cord blood samples,
followed by venous blood samples, were obtained at birth and at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days after
birth and then at postmenstrual age (PMA) 32, 36, and 40 weeks at the neonatal intensive
care unit at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Göteborg, Sweden.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Serum phospholipid fatty acids were transmethylated and
measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Mann-Whitney test, logistic
regression Spearman rank correlation, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
were used to compare differences between infants with no ROP and infants who developed
ROP.
RESULTS Serum levels from 78 infants (43 male [55%]; mean [SD] GA, 25.5 [1.4] weeks) with
a known ROP outcome were evaluated. Lower area under the curve (AUC) of arachidonic acid
(AA) (20:4 ω-6) was seen in infants with a later diagnosis of ROP compared with infants with
no ROP in the first month of life (mean, 34.05 [95% CI, 32.10-36.00] vs 37.15 [95% CI,
34.85-39.46]; P < .05). In addition, lower levels of AA at 32 weeks’PMA were seen in infants
with later severe ROP compared with in those without ROP (mean, 7.06 [95% CI, 6.60-7.52]
vs 8.74 [95% CI, 7.80-9.67]; P < .001). In logistic modeling, low postnatal serum levels of AA
and GA at birth identified with a sensitivity greater than 90% of infants who developed ROP.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Low postnatal levels of the ω-6 LC-PUFAs (AA) are strongly
associated with ROP development. Evaluating postnatal AA fraction after birth in addition to
GA may be useful for ROP prediction.

 R
etinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially
sight-threatening neurovascular disease that in
settings of high-quality care affects primarily
extremely preterm infants. It is a condition in which a vari-
ety of factors induce a first phase of reduced retinal vessel
growth and microvascular degeneration, followed by a sec-
ond phase of pathologic neovascularization, which may
lead to retinal detachment.1 Oxygen supplementation is a
major risk factor for ROP, and higher oxygen saturation tar-
gets are associated with increased ROP risk.2 In rodents,
hyperoxia3 and fluctuating oxygenation4 lead to delayed
physiologic retinal vascularization and subsequent neovas-
cularization. Control of oxygen administration has been
critical to ROP prevention.5 However, the optimal degree of
oxygenation of a very immature individual is still not
known.
The challenge of neonatal intensive care is to balance
between the needs of a fetus at a certain developmental
stage and the conditions required to sustain growth and
development during extrauterine life. When rapid brain and
retina development take place during the third trimester,
long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), which
are structural and functional components of most cell mem-
branes, are selectively transferred from the mother to the
fetus.6,7 Of these, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6 ω-3)
and arachidonic acid (AA) (20:4 ω-6) are the most abundant
LC-PUFAs in the central nervous system.8 With current
standard care, extremely preterm infants receive insuffi-
cient amounts of both DHA and AA in parenteral nutrition,
as reflected in low serum levels of these fatty acids (FAs).9-11
Results of in vivo animal studies12-15 comparing diets with
ω-3 vs ω-6 LC-PUFAs suggest that these essential dietary lip-
ids affect retinal health and disease. Research on LC-PUFAs
in preterm infants has focused mainly on the role of ω-3
LC-PUFAs and in particular on DHA, which is crucial for
brain and eye development. In the retina, DHA is enriched
in rod photoreceptor outer segments16 and is essential
for their differentiation and survival17 and signal trans-
duction.18 A recently published clinical trial (the Donna Mega
Study19) comparing the effects of the parenteral emulsion
SMOFlipid with 15% fish oil (Fresenius Kabi) vs Clinoleic
(Baxter) on ROP and other morbidities and growth failed to
find any effect on outcome measurements.20 In other studies
performed in Europe, Turkey, and Australia, the use of
dietary supplementation with ω-3 LC-PUFAs has been incon-
sistent in preventing ROP, with a reduction in any ROP but
not a reduction in severe ROP in very preterm infants in
one study21 and no reduction of ROP with enteral DHA
supplementation22 or with parenteral nutrition23 in a second
study.
Fish oil supplementation20-24 has been shown to affect
serum and plasma levels20,24; to our knowledge, however,
the influence on longitudinal levels from birth to 40
weeks’postmenstrual age (PMA) has not been evaluated in
extremely preterm infants, who are at most risk of develop-
ing severe ROP. The aim of this study was to examine the
association between circulating longitudinal levels of
LC-PUFAs and ROP in extremely preterm infants.
Methods
Study Design
The Donna Mega Study19 was a randomized, open-label, con-
trolled trial conducted at a single site in Sweden designed to
compare the effects of the parenteral emulsion SMOFlipid
(containing 15% fish oil rich in ω-3 LC-PUFAs) with olive oil–
based Clinoleic (without fish oil) on ROP and other morbidi-
ties and growth. The trial was approved by the Regional Ethi-
cal Board, Gothenburg (Dnr 303-11) at the University of
Gothenburg, Göteborg, Sweden. Informed written consent
was obtained for all participants from their parents or guard-
ians. No manufacturer of the parenteral products contributed
to the design of the study, the accrual or analysis of the data,
or the preparation of the manuscript. The protocol for the
Donna Mega Study is available online.19 The major outcome
of evaluating an association between parenteral nutrition
with and without fish oil and ROP and other morbidities and
growth was described in 2017 by Najm et al.20
Patients and Nutritional Management
Infants born at gestational age (GA) less than 28 weeks were
enrolled from the neonatal intensive care unit at Sahlgrenska
University Hospital in Göteborg, Sweden, from April 4, 2013,
to September 22, 2015. Exclusion criteria were major malfor-
mations. Parents of 90 of 138 eligible infants agreed to par-
ticipation after written informed consent. The nutritional
strategy has been described previously.20,25 Briefly, all
infants received parenteral and enteral nutrition according to
clinical routine. Parenteral nutrition was initiated as soon as
possible after birth. The parenteral lipid dosing strategy was
to deliver a dose of 2 to 3 g/kg of body weight every 24
hours. Enteral nutrition used either maternal or donor breast
milk with individualized fortification. Minimal enteral feed-
ing was started within 3 hours of birth and was administered
every 2 to 3 hours (1-2 mL per meal), with a gradual increase
in volume. Seventy-eight infants (43 male [55%]; mean [SD]
GA, 25.5 [1.4] weeks) with a known ROP outcome were
evaluated.
Key Points
Question How are circulatory levels of ω-3 and ω-6 long-chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids associated with retinopathy of
prematurity?
Findings In this secondary analysis of data from a randomized
clinical trial of 78 infants, higher ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid
arachidonic acid serum levels were associated with a lower risk of
developing any retinopathy of prematurity, as well as
sight-threatening retinopathy of prematurity.
Meaning The ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid is
associated with a lower risk of developing retinopathy of
prematurity; while these findings do not indicate a
cause-and-effect relationship, they support testing the hypothesis
of supplementation of arachidonic acid in extremely preterm
infants to reduce the risk of developing retinopathy of
prematurity.

 Eye Examinations
Retinopathy of prematurity screening started at 5 to 6 weeks’
postnatal age but not before 31 weeks’PMA. Retinal examina-
tions through dilated pupils were performed biweekly to twice
a week depending on ROP severity. Retinopathy of prematu-
ritywasclassifiedaccordingtotheinternationalclassification,26
and the recommendations of the Early Treatment for Reti-
nopathy of Prematurity Cooperative Group27 were followed for
treatment.
Morbidities
Diagnoses of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing en-
terocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus, and sepsis were re-
trievedfromclinicalrecords.Bronchopulmonarydysplasiawas
defined as moderate to severe lung disease with a need for oxy-
gen supplementation at 36 weeks’PMA, necrotizing entero-
colitis was diagnosed by clinical signs and radiologic findings
(Bell stages 2-3), and patent ductus arteriosus was registered
when the infant had clinical symptoms that required either
pharmacological or surgical treatment. Sepsis was diagnosed
by clinical symptoms accompanied by a blood culture posi-
tive for bacteria or fungi. When the culture contained Staphy-
lococcus epidermidis, an elevated C-reactive protein level (>20
mg/L) was required for diagnosis (to convert C-reactive pro-
tein level to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524).
Blood Sampling and Laboratory Analyses
Cord blood samples, followed by venous blood samples, were
obtained at birth and at postnatal days 1, 7, 14, and 28, as well
as at PMA of 32, 36, and 40 weeks. The serum phospholipids
were extracted28 and then fractionated on a single aminopro-
pyl cartridge (Sep-Pak; Waters Corporation). The FA methyl es-
ters derived from the serum phospholipids were measured by
gaschromatography–massspectrometryandexpressedasmo-
lar percentage.20 Longitudinal phospholipid LC-PUFA pro-
files were analyzed, and the quantified FAs are listed in the
eTable in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
It was previously found that supplementation with SMOFlipid
containing 15% fish oil during parenteral nutrition increases ei-
cosapentaenoic acid (EPA) substantially and DHA marginally,
reduces AA, and decreases the AA to DHA ratio.20 As expected,

program (SPSS 23 for Microsoft Windows; IBM). In all analyses,

Results
Clinical Characteristics of the Patients
Among the 90 infants recruited for the original study, 78 (87%)
survived to the final examination for ROP and were included
in this longitudinal clinical study. Seventeen infants did not
develop ROP, 8 developed stage 1 ROP, 22 developed stage 2
ROP, and 31 infants developed stage 3 ROP. In total, 22 infants
had type 1 ROP and were treated. The clinical characteristics
of the study infants are listed in Table 1.
Serum Fractions of LC-PUFAs and ROP
First Postnatal Month
Area under the curve analysis demonstrated that during the
first month of life AA was the only LC-PUFA that had signifi-
cantly lower serum fractions in infants who later developed
any or severe ROP compared with infants without ROP. There
was no correlation between GA at birth and the first month of
life AA AUC. There were no differences in any of the other ω-3
or ω-6 LC-PUFA AUCs during the first postnatal month be-
tween ROP groups (Table 2).
At 32 Weeks’PMA
The fraction of ω-3 LC-PUFA 18:3 ω-3 (α-linolenic acid) was sig-
nificantly lower at 32 weeks’PMA in infants with severe ROP
than in infants with no ROP, but no difference in 18:3 ω-3 lev-
els was seen between the groups with any ROP vs no ROP. Re-
garding the fraction of ω-3 LC-PUFAs EPA and DHA, no differ-
ences were found between infants with no ROP compared with
those with any or severe ROP at this time point. At 32 weeks,
thefractionofω-6LC-PUFA20:3ω-6(dihomo-γ-linolenicacid)
was significantly lower in infants with severe ROP compared
with infants with no ROP, but no difference in 20:3 ω-6 levels
was seen in infants with any vs no ROP (Table 3). There was
correlation between GA at birth and AA serum fractions at 32
weeks’PMA (r = 0.234, P < .05). However, the ω-6 LC-PUFA
20:4 ω-6 (AA) fraction was lower at 32 weeks’ PMA in
infants with no ROP (mean, 8.74 [95% CI, 7.80-9.67]), in
infants with severe ROP (mean, 7.06 [95% CI, 6.60-7.52]),
and in infants with any ROP (mean, 7.26 [95% CI, 6.91-7.60])
after adjustment for GA (Table 3 and Figure 1). No differ-
ences in AA fractions circulating in the serum were found
between any of the groups with ROP vs without ROP at 36
weeks’and 40 weeks’PMA.
Prediction of ROP
The probability of developing either any or severe ROP was af-
fected by (1) GA at birth of the infant and (2) the AUC AA level
during the first month of life, as demonstrated by logistic re-
gressionanalysis.Receiveroperatingcharacteristiccurveanaly-
sis revealed that the combination of circulating fraction of AA
in the serum and GA can differentiate between infants with-
out and with any ROP, with an AUC of 0.806, a sensitivity of
95.1%, and a specificity of 41.2%. An even stronger differen-
tiation was found between infants without any ROP and in-
fants with severe ROP, with an AUC of 0.886, a sensitivity of
90.3%, and a specificity of 70.6% (Figure 2A and B).
In addition, ROC curve analysis for the panel of AA at 32
weeks’PMA and GA at birth had excellent predictive ability to
differentiatebetweeninfantswithnoROPandinfantswithlater
ROP, with an AUC of 0.825, a sensitivity of 96.6%, and a speci-
ficity of 53.3%. It had close to excellent prognostic ability to
differentiatebetweeninfantswithnoROPandinfantswithlater
severe ROP, with an AUC of 0.894, a sensitivity of 96.8%, and
a specificity of 78.6% (Figure 2C and D).

 Discussion
We found that low postnatal serum phospholipid levels con-
taining ω-6 LC-PUFA AA (20:4 ω-6) were strongly associated
with and highly predictive of later ROP (any ROP and severe
ROP). To the best of our knowledge, this finding has not been
reported previously. Low levels of serum fractions of AA in the
firstmonthoflifehavebeenfoundinverypreterminfantswith
late onset of sepsis.11 Serum fractions of AA decreased signifi-
cantly after birth and remained significantly lower through-
out the postnatal course in infants with ROP compared with
infants with no ROP. Overall, our analysis showed that 3
of the 8 analyzed LC-PUFAs were associated with ROP.
Together with LC-PUFAs, fractions of AA and the monoun-
saturated FAs 18:3 ω-3 (α-linolenic acid) and 20:3 ω-6
(dihomo-γ-linolenic acid) were higher in the group of
infants without ROP than in those with severe ROP. Of these
FAs, the most predictive LC-PUFA in logistic modeling was
AA, even after adjusting for GA at birth.
Both DHA and AA are selectively transferred from the
mother to the fetus during the third trimester. The relative pro-
portion of AA in fetal blood is 2-fold higher than in maternal
bloodduringthistrimester,andfetalDHAlevelincreasesabove
maternal levels after approximately 30 weeks of gestation.26
Although DHA is the most abundant FA in cell membrane lip-
ids in the brain and retina, AA is a dominant FA in mem-
branes of the vascular endothelium.27 In brain and retina, AA
is the predominant LC-PUFA up to approximately 37 and 32
gestational weeks, respectively.29
A large proportion (28% [22 of 78]) of the infants in this
study were treated for ROP compared with infants born be-
tween 2008 and 2009 who participated in a Swedish na-
tional population-based study,30 where 12.8% of infants born
withGAlessthan28weeksweretreated.Thereareseveralpos-
sible explanations for this discrepancy. The present study was
not population based, and only 90 of 138 eligible infants were
enrolled, of which 78 survived. In addition, an increase in ROP
treatment has been seen in Sweden, with large regional varia-
tions after implementation in 2014 of higher oxygen satura-
tion targets.31
Many studies have focused on DHA and its importance for
vision and cognitive development, but few studies have ad-
dressed the role of AA during fetal and neonatal life and after
preterm birth. Like DHA, AA is an important component of cell
membranes, where a change in composition results in changed
function.32 Arachidonic acid is particularly enriched in the
vasculature, and its metabolites can both stimulate and in-
hibit angiogenesis and inflammation.33 In addition, AA de-
rivatives stimulate both relaxation and contraction of blood

Our finding of an association between low serum frac-
tions of AA and ROP indicates that low fractions of AA in the
serum may be involved in the pathogenesis of ROP. This re-
sult is in accord with work by Crawford et al,27 who proposed
that an important component of preterm morbidities, such as
ROP, is impaired vascular integrity resulting from a lack of DHA
and AA in endothelial membranes.
Fish oil–based lipid solutions containing EPA may in-
creaseplasmaEPAconcentrationstononphysiologiclevelsand
decrease AA concentrations.20,22,39 Therefore, the use of fish
oil in preterm infants without supplementation of extra AA is
questionable. Reports indicate that early gavage feeding of oil
with DHA from algae40 or low-EPA fish oil–derived DHA41 and
algae-derived DHA plus AA from fungi42 successfully raises
blood concentrations of these FAs, without adverse effects.
We found no association between DHA and ROP in this
study. However, considering the importance of DHA for reti-
nal development, DHA deficiency likely alters retinal devel-
opmentthroughouttheperinatalperiod.Docosahexaenoicacid
promotes photoreceptor differentiation, protects cells from
apoptosis, and is essential for photoreceptor function.17 In ad-
dition, retinal ganglion cells have a high DHA uptake and ap-
pear to be especially vulnerable to DHA deficiency.43
Limitations
Thiswasasmallclinicalstudy,inwhichwedonotknowtowhat
extent the FA provided by the parenteral supplementation is
absorbed. Therefore, we can only speculate that low levels of
AA may be involved in the pathogenesis of ROP.
Conclusions
After birth, extremely preterm infants in this study had a defi-
cit of AA, which was associated with later ROP development.
Therefore, the role of AA in ROP development and predic-
tion, as well as AA supplementation, for preterm infants needs
further study.
