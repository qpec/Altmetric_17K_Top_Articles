ABSTRACT
Objective: Obesity is one of the primary healthcare challenges of the 21st century. Signals relaying information regarding energy needs are
integrated within the brain to influence body weight. Central among these integration nodes are the brain pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) peptides,
perturbations of which disrupt energy balance and promote severe obesity. However, POMC neurons are neurochemically diverse and the crucial
source of POMC peptides that regulate energy homeostasis and body weight remains to be fully clarified.
Methods: Given that a 5-hydroxytryptamine 2c receptor (5-HT2CR) agonist is a current obesity medication and 5-HT2CR agonist’s effects on
appetite are primarily mediated via POMC neurons, we hypothesized that a critical source of POMC regulating food intake and body weight is
specifically synthesized in cells containing 5-HT2CRs. To exclusively manipulate Pomc synthesis only within 5-HT2CR containing cells, we
generated a novel 5-HT2CRCRE mouse line and intercrossed it with Cre recombinase-dependent and hypothalamic specific reactivatable PomcNEO
mice to restrict Pomc synthesis to the subset of hypothalamic cells containing 5-HT2CRs. This provided a means to clarify the specific contribution
of a defined subgroup of POMC peptides in energy balance and body weight.
Results: Here we transform genetically programed obese and hyperinsulinemic male mice lacking hypothalamic Pomc with increased appetite,
reduced physical activity and compromised brown adipose tissue (BAT) into lean, healthy mice via targeted restoration of Pomc function only
within 5-HT2CR expressing cells. Remarkably, the same metabolic transformation does not occur in females, who despite corrected feeding
behavior and normalized insulin levels remain physically inactive, have lower energy expenditure, compromised BAT and develop obesity.
Conclusions: These data provide support for the functional heterogeneity of hypothalamic POMC neurons, revealing that Pomc expression within
5-HT2CR expressing neurons is sufficient to regulate energy intake and insulin sensitivity in male and female mice. However, an unexpected sex
difference in the function of this subset of POMC neurons was identified with regard to energy expenditure. We reveal that a large sex difference in
physical activity, energy expenditure and the development of obesity is driven by this subpopulation, which constitutes approximately 40% of all
POMC neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. This may have broad implications for strategies utilized to combat obesity, which at present
largely ignore the sex of the obese individual.

 1. INTRODUCTION
When energy intake exceeds energetic demands, energy is stored
primarily as fat. Excess adipose accumulation is the hallmark feature of
obesity. Though men and women are exposed to the same environ-
mental conditions, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports higher
rates of obesity in women worldwide, reaching twice the prevalence of
men in some regions of the world [1]. Obesity has a significant and
widespread impact on human health, placing it at the forefront of
healthcare priorities and challenges of this century. Obesity medica-
tions are in general prescribed without attention to the sex of the obese
individual, implying the absence of sex-based differences in the mo-
lecular regulation of energy balance.
Insights from genetic research have led to the discovery of key reg-
ulators of energy balance [2], such as the melanocortin peptides
encoded by the pro-opiomelanocortin gene (Pomc) [3]. Humans and
animals unable to synthesize melanocortins or the receptor through
which they primarily signal to influence energy balance, the melano-
cortin4 receptor (MC4R/Mc4r), have dramatically increased food
intake, reduced physical activity or energy expenditure and develop
profound obesity [4,5]. POMC/Pomc function also has broader appli-
cation to common obesity; in both high fat diet-induced obesity and
middle-age associated obesity, POMC neuron activity within the
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) is diminished, which has
been proposed to have a causal role in the increased acquisition of
body
weight
and
adiposity
[6e8].
Treatment
with
a
5-
hydroxytryptamine 2c receptor (5-HT2CR) agonist, such as the new
obesity medication lorcaserin (Arena Pharmaceuticals), restores
diminished POMC neuron function and improves obesity [9e11].
Furthermore, inactivating 5-HT2CRs specifically on POMC neurons in
mice, a genetic strategy employed to manipulate 5-HT2CR expression,
prevents the anorectic effect of 5-HT2CR agonists [12], thereby
revealing that 5-HT2CR agonists modulate food intake via POMC
neurons. Thus, POMC peptides are an important driver of body weight
and POMC expressing neurons are amenable to pharmacological
manipulation. Here, we sought to clarify the source of POMC peptides
that critically mediate body weight using a newly developed genetic
approach.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Mice
5-HT2CRCRE line. 5.6 kb of genomic DNA containing portions of the final
exon and the 30 UTR of the murine Htr2c gene was amplified by PCR
from R1 ES cells [(129X1/SvJ � 129S1)F1 genetic background] and
cloned into a plasmid for insertion of a FRT-NEO-FRT-IRES-CRE
cassette between the STOP codon and the polyadenylation site, as
previously described [17]. The targeting construct was linearized using
NotI and electroporated into R1 mouse embryonic stem cells at the
University of Michigan Transgenic Animal Model Core. Neomycin-
resistant clones were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR [18] for
copy number of the native Htr2c allele and further confirmed by
Southern blotting using an external probe. Correctly targeted ES cells
were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts to generate chimeras. Male
chimeras were then bred to C57BL/6J females, and pups were gen-
otyped to confirm insertion of IRES-Cre into the appropriate locus.
These 5-HT2CRCRE pups were then bred to a germline FlpO deleter
strain (129S4/SvJae-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm2(FLP*)Sor/J; Jackson Labora-
tory) to remove the Neo cassette. Pups positive for FlpO and 5-
HT2CRCRE were genotyped for loss of the neo cassette in 5-HT2CRCRE
and further bred away from the FlpO allele.
5-HT2CRCRE mice were then intercrossed with either ROSA26-stop-
enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (B6.129X1-Gt(ROSA)
26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos/J; Jackson Laboratory) to create a reporter 5-
HT2CRYFP line or PomcNEO mice [13] to generate wild type, 5-
HT2CRCRE, ARC Pomc null (PomcNEO), and restored Pomc specifically
in 5-HT2CR expressing cells (Pomc5-HT2CR) littermates.
All mice were group housed and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle
with ad libitum access to water and standard laboratory chow diet. All
experiments were in accordance with guidelines and approvals of the
University of Michigan or the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act
1986.
2.2. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Tissue was processed for endogenous POMC and for 5-HT2CRYFP as
previously described [9e11]. Briefly, under deep terminal anesthesia,
mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma). Brains were
extracted, post-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 4 �C, cry-
oprotected in 20% sucrose at 4 �C and then sectioned coronally on a
freezing sliding microtome at 25 mm. Tissue was processed for POMC-
immunoreactivity (IR) and 5-HT2CRYFP (GFP-IR) as previously described
[14,15] using rabbit anti-POMC primary antibody (1:1000; H-029-30,
Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, USA), chicken anti-GFP
(1:500; ab13970, AbCam, Cambridge, UK) and Alexa Fluor second-
ary antibodies (1:500 A-11012, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK),
respectively. Single and dual-labeled POMC-IR and GFP-IR cells were
counted in the ARC [16]. Analysis was carried out on 7 levels of ARC
(�1.46 to �2.18 from Bregma) for each mouse (n ¼ 4/sex).
2.3. Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was purified from whole hypothalamus, brainstem and
interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) using RNA STAT 60 (AMS
Biotechnology, Abington, UK) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions and as previously described (9 months of age; n ¼ 5e9/
genotype/sex) [13]. cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of
500 ng hypothalamic RNA, 1000 ng brainstem RNA and 500 ng BAT
RNA. Real-time PCR analysis of cDNA was performed in duplicate on
an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system using Taqman or Sybr
assays

expressed in arbitrary units corrected to the geometric average of four
housekeeping genes: 18s, 36b4, bactin and glyceraldehyde-3-

2.4. Metabolic profile
Body weight was measured from weaning up to 1 year of age (n ¼ 7e
17/genotype/sex). Home cage 24-h food intake was measured up to 6
months of age (n ¼ 5e9/genotype/sex). At 9 months of age, a more
detailed energy balance profile was performed, including light and dark
cycle food intake, locomotor activity and energy expenditure assess-
ment using indirect calorimetry in a Metabolic-Trace (Meta-Trace)
system (Ideas Studio, UK; n ¼ 5e9/genotype/sex). Body composition
was also analyzed at 7e9 months of age using dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) Lunar PIXImus2 mouse densitometer (General
Electric Medical Systems, Fitchburg, WI, USA; n ¼ 5e11/genotype/

 paraffin, cut into 5 mm sections and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. WAT cell diameter (mm) and BAT lipid droplet size (% of total
area) was measured on an inverted light microscope (Olympus BX41,
Olympus UK Ltd, Southend-on-Sea, UK) using Cell
^
D Olympus Software
(Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan). Analysis was carried out on 5-9 sections for
each mouse (9 months of age; n ¼ 4e6/genotype/sex).
Blood samples were taken from the left ventricle in 6 h light cycle
fasted terminally anesthetized mice (9 months of age; n ¼ 5e9/ge-
notype/sex) (phenobarbital sodium (Dolethal); Vétoquinol, UK). Insulin
and leptin were assayed using a two-plex electrochemical lumines-
cence microtiter plate immunoassay (MesoScale Discovery, Gaithers-
burg, MD, USA).
2.5. Insulin tolerance test
Mice (6e8 months of age; n ¼ 5e9/genotype/sex) were fasted for 6 h
during the light cycle. Blood was sampled from tail vein immediately
prior to insulin (1.1 U/kg IP, males; 0.8 U/kg IP, females) bolus, and 15,
30, 45, 60 and 90 min following bolus administration. Blood glucose
was analyzed using AlphaTrak glucometer (Chicago, IL, USA).
2.6. Statistics
Data were analyzed with One-way, Two-way or Repeated Measures
ANOVA or ANCOVA followed by Tukey’s or Bonferroni post hoc tests.
General linear models were also performed for energy expenditure
analysis. For all analyses, significance was assigned at P < 0.05. Data
are presented as mean � SEM.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Generation of 5-HT2CRCRE line
To clarify the source of POMC peptides that underpin energy balance
and body weight regulation, we utilized a Cre recombinase-dependent
and ARC specific reactivatable PomcNEO line [13] to restore Pomc
synthesis within the discrete subset of cells expressing 5-HT2CRs. To
achieve this, we first generated a 5-HT2CRCRE line. To confirm that 5-
HT2CRCRE is contained in cells expressing endogenous 5-HT2CR, 5-
HT2CRCRE mice were intercrossed with B6.129X1-Gt(ROSA)26Sort-
m1(EYFP)Cos/J (Rosa26YFP) mice, which have a loxP-flanked STOP
sequence followed by an YFP gene inserted into the Gt(ROSA)26Sor
locus. Intercrossing with 5-HT2CRCRE mice removes the STOP
sequence and YFP is visualized in 5-HT2CRCRE expressing cells
(Figure S1A). Performing immunofluorescent staining in the ARC for
YFP-immunoreactivity (IR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to
label endogenous 5-HT2CR mRNA revealed that the majority of Cre
containing cells expressed endogenous 5-HT2CR mRNA (Figure S1B).
3.2. Anatomical localization and genetic manipulation of subset of
hypothalamic Pomc co-expressing 5-HT2CRs
To determine the anatomical localization of the subset of ARC POMC
neurons specifically co-expressing 5-HT2CRs, dual-immunofluorescent
analysis was performed for GFP-IR and POMC-IR in the 5-HT2CRYPF
line. This analysis revealed that approximately 40% of ARC POMC
neurons co-express 5-HT2CRs in male and female mice (Figure 1AeC).
This co-expression profile is similar to that previously observed in rats
[9]. Further analysis of anatomical co-localization indicated that this
40% co-expression rate was consistent across the rostral-caudal
extent of the ARC (Figure 1C).
To investigate the physiological importance of this specific source of
POMC peptides in the regulation of energy balance and body weight,
we intercrossed a Cre recombinase-dependent and ARC specific
reactivatable PomcNEO line to restore Pomc expression only within cells
expressing 5-HT2CRs (Figure 1D). As expected, PomcNEO mice had no
detectable hypothalamic Pomc mRNA, whereas Pomc was restored by
44% in male and 41% in female Pomc5-HT2CR mice (Figure 1E,F). This
Pomc reactivation level is consistent with the anatomical co-
localization determined above. No differences in Pomc expression
among genotypes were detected in the brainstem, which includes the
nucleus tractus solitarius (Figure S1C). Therefore, we created a genetic
means to probe the specific function of a subset of ARC POMC neurons
in the regulation of whole body energy balance and body weight.
3.3. Hypothalamic Pomc expressed exclusively within 5-HT2CR
containing cells modulates energy intake in male and female mice
Given that current obesity medication 5-HT2CR agonist lorcaserin im-
proves obesity by influencing appetite, but not energy expenditure [19],
and that 5-HT2CR agonists reduce food intake via increased activity of
POMC neurons [9,20], we surmised that POMC peptides synthesized
exclusively in neurons expressing 5-HT2CRs perform an essential role
in the regulation of energy intake. To investigate this, we compared
24-hour food intake in PomcNEO, 5-HT2CRCRE, wild type and mice with
restored Pomc expression only in cells expressing 5-HT2CRs (Pomc5-
HT2CR). As expected, male and female PomcNEO mice exhibited sig-
nificant hyperphagia (Figure 2A,B; Figure S2AeC, S2G-I), consistent
with previous reports [13]. Restoration of hypothalamic Pomc
expression only within 5-HT2CR cells normalized 24-h food intake in
both male and female mice (Figure 2A,B). Additional circadian analysis
revealed that PomcNEO energy intake was significantly higher during
the dark cycle in male (Figure S2B,C) and female (Figure S2H,I) mice,
and this was normalized by the restoration of Pomc expression in 5-
HT2CR cells in both sexes. Next, we tracked 24-h food intake in
male and female mice by genotype until 6 months of age. We observed
that PomcNEO hyperphagia persisted with age, whereas Pomc5-HT2CR
mice continued to consume food at a level consistent with control 5-
HT2CRCRE and wild type littermates (Figure S2A,G). Consequently,
these data indicate that POMC peptides synthesized exclusively in
neurons expressing 5-HT2CRs are sufficient to mediate POMC’s effects
on food intake.
3.4. Unexpected sex difference in physical activity and energy
expenditure modulated by hypothalamic Pomc exclusively expressed
within 5-HT2CR containing cells
Analysis of energy homeostasis in Pomc5-HT2CR mice uncovered a
substantial and unexpected sex difference in the molecular regulation
of physical activity and energy expenditure. In both males and females,
PomcNEO mice exhibited significantly reduced 24-h locomotor activity,
which was accounted for by a reduction in activity within the dark, but
not light cycle (Figure 2C,D; Figure S2E,F,K,L). However, restoration of
Pomc5-HT2CR function fully normalized physical activity only in male
mice (Figure 2C; Figure S2E,F). While a significant effect of body fat
mass on total daily energy expenditure was detected in males
(Figure 2E), this did not vary by genotype. Conversely, in female mice,
restoration of Pomc5-HT2CR function had no impact on reduced physical
activity (Figure 2D, Figure S2K,L) or total daily energy expenditure
(Figure 2F). Thus, in females, a significant genotype effect of fat mass
on total daily energy expenditure was observed. A general linear model
using both fat and lean mass explained 80% of the variance in energy
expenditure in pooled female wild type and 5-HT2CRCRE mice. Both
Pomc5-HT2CR and PomcNEO female mice displayed significantly reduced
total daily energy expenditure compared to wild type and 5-HT2CRCRE
female siblings (Tukey’s post hoc P < 0.01) but did not differ from
each other (P > 0.05). We next explored the impact of genotype and
body composition on resting metabolic rate in female mice (Figure 2G).

 A general linear model using both fat and lean mass explained 91.8%
of the variance in energy expenditure in pooled female wild type and 5-
HT2CRCRE mice. These results reveal that both PomcNEO and Pomc5-
HT2CR female mice had significantly reduced resting energy expendi-
ture compared to wild type and 5-HT2CRCRE siblings (Tukey’s post hoc
P < 0.01) but did not differ from each other (P > 0.05).
Brown adipocytes contain a large number of mitochondria for ther-
mogenesis, and nutrient oxidation in BAT can account for up to 60% of
the total energy expenditure of mice [21,22]. Melanocortinergic
regulation of BAT thermogenesis and energy expenditure has been
reported via Mc4rs expressed by cholinergic preganglionic sympa-
thetic neurons within the intermediolateral nucleus of the thoracic
spinal cord (IML) [23e25]. The IML is directly innervated by ARC POMC
neurons [26,27] and postganglionic neurons innervating brown adi-
pose tissue receive projections from the IML [28e30], suggesting a
pathway through which POMC neurons may participate in the regu-
lation of BAT thermogenesis and energy expenditure.
We therefore next examined whether Pomc exclusively synthesized
within 5-HT2CR expressing neurons influences BAT function. In male
and female mice, genetic inactivation of ARC Pomc was associated
with increased lipid accumulation in BAT (Figure 2HeJ) and reduced
expression of Pgc-1a and Elolv3, mitochondrial genes important for
BAT thermogenesis (Figure 2KeL). In male mice, restoration of
Pomc5-HT2CR function normalized BAT lipid accumulation (Figure 2H,I)
and Pgc-1a and Elolv3 expression (Figure 2K). In contrast, Pomc5-
HT2CR female mice displayed an increase in BAT lipid content
(Figure 2H,J) and a downregulation in thermogenic gene expression
(Figure 2L) compared to control littermates. These data suggest that
impaired BAT thermogenesis in female PomcNEO and Pomc5-HT2CR
mice contributes to the observed reduction in whole body energy
expenditure.
Taken together, these data signify that ARC POMC regulates both
physical activity related energy demands and resting metabolism and
that restoration of POMC function within the subset of 5-HT2CR
expressing neurons is not sufficient to appropriately regulate energy
expenditure or BAT function in female mice. No differences in respi-
ratory exchange ratio (RER) were detected by genotype in either sex,
and, in the combined data set, there was no sex effect on the RER
(Figure S2D,J). However, we uncovered an unexpected sex difference
in the molecular underpinnings driving physical activity and deter-
mined that Pomc5-HT2CR have a broader, sex-specific, function in the
regulation of energy usage.

 3.5. Unexpected sex difference in body weight regulation
modulated by hypothalamic Pomc exclusively expressed within 5-
HT2CR containing cells
We next investigated the ramifications of this discrete source of ARC
POMC peptides on body weight and adiposity. Consistent with the
metabolic consequence of restored energy balance in male Pomc5-
HT2CR mice, a prevention of obesity in male Pomc5-HT2CR mice was
observed compared to PomcNEO littermates (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
male Pomc5-HT2CR mice displayed levels of lean mass (Figure 3C,D), fat
mass (Figure 3F) and leptin levels (Figure S3A) that were comparable
to control 5-HT2CRCRE and wild type littermates. Likewise, male

 PomcNEO mice had larger white adipocytes and this phenotype was
normalized in male Pomc5-HT2CR mice (Figure 3H,I).
In contrast, ARC Pomc synthesized within neurons expressing 5-
HT2CRs was not sufficient to regulate adiposity in female mice. Fe-
male Pomc5-HT2CR mice were genetically predisposed to develop
obesity compared to wild type and 5-HT2CRCRE female siblings
(Figure 3B), with increased fat mass (Figure 3C,G) and displayed
significantly larger white adipocytes (Figure 3H,J). This elevation in
body weight and fat mass was less severe than that produced by full
ARC Pomc nulls, though both PomcNEO and Pomc5-HT2CR mice showed
comparable increases in white adipocyte size. However, only PomcNEO
mice exhibited statistically increased lean mass (Figure 3E) and leptin
levels (Figure S3B) and this was corrected in Pomc5-HT2CR mice. These
data reveal that the subpopulation of ARC POMC expressed within 5-
HT2CR containing neurons is sufficient to regulate whole body en-
ergy balance, body weight and adiposity in male, but not female, mice.
3.6. Hypothalamic Pomc expressed exclusively within 5-HT2CR
containing cells modulates insulin sensitivity in male and female
mice
Recent reports revealed that though PomcNEO mice exhibit insulin
resistance, they display normal glucose levels and improved glucose
tolerance, primarily by increasing glycosuria [31,32]. We next
considered whether Pomc synthesized exclusively within 5-HT2CR
expressing cells is sufficient to normalize PomcNEO hyperinsulinemia
and impaired insulin tolerance. As expected, severely hyperphagic and
obese male and female PomcNEO mice exhibited pronounced
hyperinsulinemia (Figure 4A,B) with normal fasting blood glucose
(Figure 4C,D), a pattern indicating insulin resistance compensated by
increased insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Consistent with
the metabolic consequence of normalized energy balance and
adiposity in male Pomc5-HT2CR mice, hyperinsulinemia was corrected in
male Pomc5-HT2CR mice compared to PomcNEO littermates (Figure 4A).
Despite disrupted energy balance and pronounced obesity, female
Pomc5-HT2CR mice also displayed insulin levels comparable to wild type
and 5-HT2CRCRE siblings (Figure 4B). Examining insulin sensitivity
further, we found that both male (Figure 4E,F) and female (Figure 4G,H)
PomcNEO mice exhibited impaired responses in an insulin tolerance
test compared with control littermates, and this was normalized by
restoring Pomc within 5-HT2CR expressing cells. Taken together, these
results indicate that despite a sex difference in energy balance and
obesity, Pomc synthesized in 5-HT2CR expressing cells is sufficient to
mediate POMC’s effects on insulin sensitivity in both male and female
mice.
These data reveal a discrete and specific sex difference in the regu-
lation of body weight, fat accumulation and adipocyte size driven by the
subpopulation of hypothalamic POMC peptides exclusively synthesized
in neurons expressing 5-HT2CRs. Interestingly, POMC within the sub-
population of ARC leptin receptor expressing neurons was sufficient to
normalize energy balance and body weight in both male and female
PomcNEO mice [32]. Thus, these data reveal a specific and functionally
distinct role of POMC within the subset of cells examined here,
providing further support for the functional heterogeneity of ARC
derived POMC peptides.

female F3,19 ¼ 60.80, P < 0.001), (C, F, G) fat mass (male F3,20 ¼ 9.43, P < 0.001; female F3,22 ¼ 42.04, P < 0.001), (HeJ) gonadal white adipocyte diameter
(male F3,14 ¼ 13.98, P < 0.001; female F3,13 ¼ 11.87, P < 0.001) were increased in ARC Pomc null (PomcNEO) mice and normalized by restoration of Pomc in 5-HT2CR neurons
(Pomc5-HT2CR) in male but not female mice. However, female PomcNEO mice still exhibited significantly greater body weight and fat mass, but not adipocyte size, compared with
Pomc5-HT2CR mice. (D, E) Both male and female PomcNEO mice exhibited significantly greater lean mass compared to Pomc5-HT2CR mice and controls. Scale bar, 2000 mm
*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 compared to control PomcWT and 5-HT2CRCRE siblings, except where noted in D, E, G and I.

 The sex difference in energy storage is consistent with significantly
reduced energy usage in female Pomc5-HT2CR mice. Given that food
intake is normalized in female Pomc5-HT2CR mice, this genetic model
reflects a new example of the cumulative impact of reduced physical
activity and energy expenditure on body weight and adiposity with
time. It may be noted that in the PomcNEO mice, the impact on energy
expenditure was much greater in the females compared to males
(compare Figure 2E,F) and the corresponding fat mass also much
greater (compare Figure 3FeG). Therefore, the localized synthesis of
POMC peptides within a subset of neurons within the discrete brain
region the ARC produces a substantial difference in the magnitude of
adiposity accumulation in male and female mice. This phenotype
cannot simply be explained by impairing POMC activity by estrogens,
because the inactivation of estrogen receptor specifically within ARC
POMC neurons does not impact fat mass or reduce energy expenditure
[33].
4. CONCLUSIONS
These findings support the functional heterogeneity of ARC POMC,
revealing that the source synthesized within 5-HT2CR expressing
neurons is sufficient to regulate energy intake and insulin sensitivity in
male and female mice. Moreover, these data provide evidence for a
specific neurochemical basis for levels of reduced physical activity and
reveal that the molecular underpinnings of the impetus to engage in
physical activity are differentially modulated in males and females.
However, physical activity comprises only one means of utilizing en-
ergy and our data further show that the same neuronal population
plays a key role, modulated by sex, in the regulation of resting rates of
expenditure. Consequently, these data uncovered an unexpected sex
difference, mediated by POMC, in total energy expenditure, thermo-
genic activity of BAT and adiposity. These findings provide evidence
that males and females are hardwired differently in their regulation of
energy balance. Given the reported reduction of POMC neuron activity
in middle age in mice [7], these data may have translational relevance
by providing a potential molecular explanation for the global sex dif-
ferences in obesity prevalence. Finally, these data may have broad
implications for future sex-specific strategies in treating overweight
and obesity.
