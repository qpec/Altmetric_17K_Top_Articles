Introduction
Most review articles support carbamazepine as a first-line pharmacotherapy for 
idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia.1–3 However, the empirical support for this recom-
mendation is somewhat suspect. Phenytoin, as the prototype for all anticonvulsants, 
was already positioned as an analgesic compound 70 years ago. Since these initial 
findings, the data that have been gathered have supported the use of anticonvulsants 
as painkillers – from phenytoin up to and including more recent anticonvulsants such 
as gabapentin and pregabalin. Since 1942, a number of papers supported phenytoin’s 
therapeutic effects in trigeminal neuralgia (Table 1). The introduction of carbamazepine 
in 1962 by Geigy shifted the interest of neurologists from phenytoin as a treatment 
for trigeminal neuralgia to carbamazepine, without sound scientific evidence. To date, 
no convincing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published supporting 
the role of carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia, and we could not identify a single 
study comparing the effects of phenytoin with those of carbamazepine. Accordingly, 
phenytoin should probably be considered more often as a viable therapy for (treatment-
resistant) trigeminal neuralgia.
Trigeminal neuralgia: one of the first repositioning 
indications of phenytoin
The exploration of phenytoin as an analgesic in neuralgic pain started 5 years after 
Putnam and Merritt identified the compound in 1937 as a treatment for convulsions.4 In 
1942, a French otolaryngologist reported that 200–300 mg phenytoin daily was effec-
tive in reducing pain in three patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia.5 In 1944, a 
case study of a patient suffering from paroxysmal abdominal pain but responding well 
to phenytoin was presented; the pain attacks in his case were (perhaps erroneously) 
interpreted as a form of focal symptomatic epilepsy.6 The first indication in the field 
of pain that was explored intensively as a new indication (repositioning) for phenytoin 
was trigeminal neuralgia, most likely due to its paroxysmal character – reminiscent 
of epileptic discharges.
Based on some of these anecdotal reports of a possible analgesic role of phenytoin 
in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia or “tic douloureux,” phenytoin was identified 
as a putative anti-trigeminal pain therapy in a number of sources published as early 
as the 1950s.7–10

Keppel Hesselink and Schatman
Bergouignan and d’Aulnay continued his work in this 
field and, in 1951, reported on the successful treatment with 
phenytoin in 17 patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia 
(300–600 mg/day). There was only one non-responder in his 
study, and the clinical effect was reported to emerge quickly 
(within 24 hours).11
This indication was supported by electrophysiological 
studies of the inhibition of potentials in the trigeminal nerve 
by phenytoin.12 Evoked delayed potentials in the trigeminal 
nerve could be abolished by the intravenous administration 
of 50 mg phenytoin.13
In 1954, a case series of 45 patients suffering from trigem-
inal neuralgia who were treated with 300–600 mg phenytoin/
day was published. Sixteen patients were full responders, 
23 patients responded partially, and there were five non-
responders.14 In a follow-up study by the same author, 59 
patients diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia were treated 
with 300–600 mg phenytoin/day, and 57 became completely 
free of pain whereas only two were non-responders.15,16 A 
further series of 20 patients were reported in 1960, with 
symptomatic relief reported by 14 of the subjects.17
At the National Workshop of Clinical Use of Phenytoin 
in Chengdu, People’s Republic of China, in 1995, the authors 
presented the results of 36 patients with trigeminal neuralgia, 
who had been randomly assigned to three treatment groups: 
phenytoin (17 patients); carbamazepine (11 patients); and 
combined phenytoin and carbamazepine (8 patients). After 
4 weeks of treatment, the effects of phenytoin and carbam-
azepine were comparable (82.35% and 81.81% responders, 
respectively), whereas combination treatment was superior.18
All studies were published between 1942 and 1995; after 
1995, we could not identify any outcome study evaluating 
phenytoin in trigeminal neuralgia.
In 2012, the Cochrane collaboration could not identify 
any RCTs of phenytoin in neuropathic pain.27
the entrance of Geigy 32883: 
carbamazepine
In 1958, the chemist Walter Schindler first described a 
number of N-heterocyclic compounds in a patent, one being 
carbamazepine; a year later, a second patent related to this 
matter was filed by Geigy. The inventors were Schindler and 
Charles Gansser. Initially, the compound was known as Geigy 
32883 and, in 1962, G32883 was registered for the treatment 
of trigeminal neuralgia.
In 1962, the first clinical article was published in The 
Lancet by Blom from the University of Uppsala, Sweden.28 
He directly linked the general clinical experiences known up 
to that point for phenytoin to the effects of the new Geigy 
drug in his own hands. Blom stated: “It soon became evident 
that the effect was very good – probably better than that of 
diphenylhydantoin.” (p.839) This conclusion was based only 
on his experience with 11 patients in an open study, yet it 
seemingly legitimized the new Geigy drug (which was patent 
protected) as a superior treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. 
Seven of these 11 patients were previously treated with phe-
nytoin: there were two non-responders on phenytoin, both 
responding to carbamazepine; two responders on phenytoin 
became non-responders after 2 years and subsequently 
responded to carbamazepine; two patients could not  
tolerate

Phenytoin and carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia
phenytoin; and two responded as well on phenytoin as on 
carbamazepine. Plasma levels were not measured. Blom 
published a comparable paper in the Archives of Neurology, 
and other uncontrolled case studies followed in the same 
period.29–33 The initial placebo controlled study was reported 
in 1966 by the hand of clinicians from Guy’s Hospital, Lon-
don (UK), who included 77 patients and analyzed the results 
of 70 patients, excluding seven dropouts.34 Carbamazepine 
was better compared to placebo (no statistics), but half of all 
patients experienced at least one side effect on carbamazepine 
compared to only 24% on a placebo.
In 1995, a systematic review was published in the BMJ 
covering all RCTs related to anticonvulsants prescribed for 
analgesia.35 Since 1995, no new RCTs have been indexed in 
this field in PubMed. The authors were able to identify only 
two RCTs on the efficacy of carbamazepine in trigeminal 
neuralgia. These RCTs both followed a crossover design 
and recruited only 27 patients and 20 patients, respectively, 
gauging outcomes after 5 days of treatment and 14 days, 
respectively. All other studies conducted were not random-
ized controlled studies. The authors also identified only three 
comparator studies wherein carbamazepine was compared 
to tizanidine, tocainide, and pimozide, but none comparing 
carbamazepine to phenytoin.
Most recent review articles state that first-line phar-
macotherapy for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia should be 
carbamazepine.36 However, given our review of the limited 
literature, the alternative statement supporting phenytoin as 
the first choice seems equally valid.
Commercial and iP reasons for 
shifting attention from phenytoin to 
carbamazepine
Interestingly, it was only after Geigy became the official 
developer of carbamazepine in the 1960s as pharmacotherapy 
for idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia that clinicians began to 
resort to the drug as their first choice for this indication, irre-
spective of the lack of convincing evidence of its superiority 
to phenytoin. Phenytoin, however, unlike carbamazepine, 
was not patent protected. It is extremely likely that carbam-
azepine’s patent protection in conjunction with aggressive 
marketing by Geigy explains why the research and clinical 
focus shifted from phenytoin to carbamazepine. To date, 
there are still no convincing RCTs proving the superiority 
of carbamazepine over phenytoin in trigeminal neuralgia. 
There is as much evidence supporting phenytoin as the first 
choice for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia rather than 
carbamazepine. Furthermore, given the complex side effects 
of carbamazepine, one might even argue for phenytoin as the 
rational first choice.
In 1975, in a JAMA article on “new uses of phenytoin” 
the authors concluded in line with our arguments: “controlled 
studies have not demonstrated conclusively the efficacy of 
either phenytoin or carbamazepine, and there is no good 
evidence to support the use of either or both agents.”37
From an ethical perspective, we struggle with this. To 
substitute patent protection and aggressive marketing for 
scientific evidence of superiority or even non-inferiority 
potentially puts our patients at risk for oligoanalgesia in the 
name of corporate profits. Although we have highlighted the 
unfortunate histories of phenytoin and carbamazepine, these 
are certainly not the only pain medications with regard to 
which the wool has been pulled over the eyes of unsuspecting 
prescribers and their patients. Our hope is that clinicians will 
accept this editorial as a warning to familiarize themselves 
with the empirical data supporting the prescription of one 
drug over another, as our cautionary tale demonstrates that 
“the next great thing” is not necessarily all that great.
