Long-standing racial differences in US life expectancy suggest that
black Americans would be exposed to significantly more family
member deaths than white Americans from childhood through
adulthood, which, given the health risks posed by grief and
bereavement, would add to the disadvantages that they face. We
analyze nationally representative US data from the National Longi-
tudinal Study of Youth (n = 7,617) and the Health and Retirement
Study (n = 34,757) to estimate racial differences in exposure to the
death of family members at different ages, beginning in childhood.
Results indicate that blacks are significantly more likely than whites to
have experienced the death of a mother, a father, and a sibling from
childhood through midlife. From young adulthood through later life,
blacks are also more likely than whites to have experienced the death
of a child and of a spouse. These results reveal an underappreciated
layer of racial inequality in the United States, one that could contrib-
ute to the intergenerational transmission of health disadvantage. By
calling attention to this heightened vulnerability of black Americans,
our findings underscore the need to address the potential impact of
more frequent and earlier exposure to family member deaths in the
process of cumulative disadvantage.
race | life expectancy | bereavement | family | disparities
T
he evidence for racial disparities in life expectancy and
mortality risk in the United States is long-standing and irre-
futable (1–3), but the potentially substantial damage to surviving
family members is a largely overlooked area of racial disadvan-
tage. The death of a family member has well-documented adverse
effects on health and other life outcomes, particularly when the
death occurs “off time” or earlier than expected (4). However, no
prior study has assessed racial disparities in exposure to the death of
multiple family members over the life course. Doing so is important
given that, despite a recent decline, the large mortality differential
between blacks and whites persists today, especially at younger ages (3,
5, 6). These statistics lead us to hypothesize that the death of specific
and multiple family members is more common among black than
among white Americans from childhood through mid to later life.
We draw on fundamental cause theory and a life course per-
spective to argue that exposure to death is a unique source of
adversity for black Americans that contributes to lifelong racial
inequality. This approach emphasizes that strains and resources
associated with stratified social conditions accumulate through-
out the life course to produce advantages and disadvantages in
wide-ranging life outcomes including socioeconomic status, the
formation and quality of relationships, and mental and physical
health (7–13). Indeed, stress experienced in childhood undermines
health years and even decades later—a fact at the cornerstone of
theoretical work on race and cumulative disadvantage across the
life course (14–18). Geronimus et al. (5, 19) describe a process of
“weathering” whereby repeated exposure to stressors associated
with racial discrimination and disadvantage contribute to early-
onset disability and death for black Americans, particularly from
young adulthood to midlife. Loss of a family member could be
central to this process of cumulative disadvantage, with each ad-
ditional loss furthering the weathering process. Indeed, research
shows that losing a child, spouse, or parent is the most stressful life
event people experience and one that affects them for years (4,
20). That stress may be widely disruptive to life in ways that in-
crease the likelihood of exposure to more stressful life events (e.g.,
residential disruption, divorce, job loss) and lead to chronic
stressors (e.g., poverty, relationship strain) is well established (7–
11). In these ways, a loss at one point in the life course can fuel
cumulative disadvantage—and the weathering resulting from this
disadvantage—over time (21). Surprisingly, although recent news
reports and protests highlight the trauma of premature deaths of
blacks in the United States, repeated and earlier exposure to loss
of family members as a unique source of disadvantage and in-
equality for black Americans has never been documented.
There are many reasons to expect that the death of a family
member is a powerful and unique type of adversity resulting from
social inequality. Developmental psychologists emphasize that
social connections are essential to human development (22, 23),
and social epidemiologists have clearly established that social ties
are fundamental to human health (24, 25). A substantial literature
on bereavement shows that the death of even one family member
(whether spouse, child, parent, or sibling) undermines physical
health and increases mortality risk (4, 26, 27). Notably, not all losses
have the same effects. A loss may be particularly consequential if it
occurs earlier in the life course than expected (28–30). For example,
the death of a parent in childhood is particularly likely to trigger
biopsychosocial sequelae that undermine health (9, 29–32). Off-time
losses in adulthood—such as losing a spouse as a young adult—may
also have a more pronounced impact (4, 33). Such early or off-time
Significance
Due to historical racial inequalities in the United States, in-
cluding poverty, inadequate health care, and criminal victimi-
zation, black Americans die at much higher rates than white
Americans. How the consequences of these elevated rates re-
verberate across family networks warrants attention. If blacks
die at higher rates and earlier in the life course than whites,
then blacks lose more loved ones from childhood through
adulthood. Through the damaging effects of grief and other
mechanisms, such losses are likely to undermine multiple life
course outcomes. By analyzing nationally representative
datasets to compare black and white Americans on the likeli-
hood of losing family members over the life course, this study
documents an intergenerational process with corrosive effects
on black families and communities.

 losses may trigger a cascade of adverse social consequences and
maladaptive biopsychosocial responses that disrupt life course
trajectories well after the losses occur. For example, one qualitative
study suggests that death of a parent during childhood or adoles-
cence may increase risk for residential instability and homelessness,
putting young women’s long-term futures at risk (34). Another
qualitative study found that the murder of close friends and rela-
tives—a common life course experience for young black men—was
often a turning point in behaviors, relationships, and outlooks (35).
Thus, if losing a family member is a disadvantage in the present in
ways that disrupt the future, racial disparities in these losses over
the life course is a tangible manifestation of racial inequality that
needs to be systematically documented.
In this spirit, this study provides a population-based investiga-
tion of racial disparities in the extent and timing of life course
exposure to the death of family members in the United States.
Conducting survival analysis with nationally representative longi-
tudinal datasets, we compare non-Hispanic blacks and whites on
exposure to the death of biological mothers, biological fathers,
siblings, children, and spouses while also considering the total
number of such deaths experienced by different ages. In doing so,
we draw attention to an underexplored racial disparity (i.e., ex-
posure to death) that likely contributes to racial disadvantage in
multiple and intersecting outcomes (e.g., health behaviors and
health) at the heart of the weathering process over the life course.
Results
We estimated racial differences in exposure to family member
deaths with data from two national datasets that are represen-
tative of an earlier birth cohort [Health and Retirement Study
(HRS); born 1900–1965] and a later birth cohort [National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY-97); born 1980–1984].
We replicated results with two additional datasets that include an
earlier birth cohort [National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979
(NLSY-79); born 1957–1965] and a later birth cohort [National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health);
born 1974–1984]. These two replication datasets yield patterns
consistent with those based on the HRS and NLSY-97 reported
below (Tables S1–S3 and Figs. S1–S4). Description of Data and
Measures provides details on measurement of variables, including
all control variables. In the HRS and NLSY-97 analyses (and in
replication datasets), we consider deaths of mothers, fathers,
siblings, spouses, and children. To take into account variability in
risk of death exposures, we limit analyses of sibling deaths to
respondents who report ever having a sibling, we restrict analyses
of child death to respondents who report ever having a live birth,
and we restrict analysis of spouse death to those who were ever
married. Additionally, for mother and father death, we restrict
the analysis to biological parents, including noncustodial parents.
Measures of parental death were coded as missing if the re-
spondent reported not knowing whether their parent was alive.
We now turn to results from the HRS and NLSY-97.
Risk of Exposure to Specific Family Member Deaths. Our non-
parametric life table approach compares blacks and whites on
the cumulative risk of exposure to specific family member deaths
at different ages. Table 1 presents the cumulative probabilities of
family member loss at each age for blacks and whites; Fig. 1 sum-
marizes ratios of cumulative risk for blacks compared with whites.
Table 1 (NLSY-97) and Fig. 1A report on black/white comparisons
with the NLSY-97 (n = 7,617); and Table 1 (HRS) and Fig. 1B
show results from the HRS (n = 34,757).
Overall, the results suggest that, for each type of family member
death and by each age considered, the cumulative risk of death
exposure is greater for blacks than whites in both datasets. For
example, in the younger NLSY-97 cohort (Fig. 1A), blacks were at
three times greater risk than whites of losing a mother, more than
twice the risk of losing a father, and 20% more likely to have lost a
sibling by age 10. Blacks were also 2.5 times more likely to have lost
a child by age 20. In the older HRS cohort (Fig. 1B), the patterns
were similar. Blacks were at twice the risk of losing a mother and
about 50% greater risk of losing a father by age 20. Blacks were also
at much greater risk than whites of losing a child during mid to later
life—about two times more likely to lose a child between the ages of
50 and 60, and over three times more likely to lose a child between
the ages of 50 and 70. Blacks were also nearly twice as likely to lose
a spouse by age 60, and 50% more likely to lose a sibling by age 60.
Although the magnitude of effects fluctuates according to family
member type, varies by age, and differs across cohorts, effects are
consistently in the same direction. The overall point is that they are sub-
stantial and always show more loss among black than white Americans.
Cumulative Exposures to Family Member Death. Next, negative bi-
nomial regressions test whether blacks are at greater risk for
cumulative death exposures—the total number of deaths accu-
mulated throughout the study period in each dataset and up to
the respondent’s age during the last survey assessment. Results
in Table 2 indicate that, in both the NLSY-97 and HRS, blacks
experience more family member deaths than do whites, net of
controls for age, gender, educational attainment of parents,
currently living in the South, mother’s age at respondent birth,

 and household size at baseline; for HRS respondents, additional
controls include born in the South and birth cohort. We also
estimated logistic regressions to predict the odds of experiencing
two or more losses by age 30 in the NLSY-97 and four or more
losses in the HRS by age 60, net of controls. Fig. 2A shows that,
in the NLSY, blacks have significantly lower odds than whites of
experiencing no family losses by the age of 30 (P < 0.001), but
over three times higher odds of experiencing the death of two or
more family members by the age of 30 (P < 0.001). Fig. 2B shows
that, in the HRS data, blacks are about 90% more likely than
whites to have experienced four or more deaths by age 60 (P <
0.001). In stark contrast, whites are 30% more likely than blacks
to have never experienced a family loss by age 60 (P < 0.001).
Life Course Timing of Death Exposures. To shed light on the life
course timing of specific deaths, we calculated the age-specific
hazard of death exposures for blacks and whites. Results are il-
lustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. Hazards are shown for ages at which data
were available and sufficient sample sizes were present. In the
NLSY-97 (Fig. 3), age-specific hazards indicate that, compared
with whites, blacks were at greater risk of losing a mother from
early childhood through young adulthood, losing a father through
their midteens, losing a sibling in their teens, and losing a child
through their late twenties. We also estimated semiparametric Cox
hazard models to predict black–white disparities in each type of death
taking into account background variables that might help to explain
the overall pattern of results (control variables noted above) (Table
S4). In the NLSY-97 data, racial differences were statistically sig-
nificant and robust to controls with the exception that the race dif-
ference in father and sibling death was no longer significant, although in
the expected direction; thus, family social and demographic contexts
help to explain racial disparities in father and sibling deaths. Even net
of controls, however, blacks experience greater risk of losing a mother
and of losing a child up to age 30 in the younger NLSY-97 cohort.
Fig. 4 illustrates the losses that occurred in the older HRS co-
horts. The race gap in the age-specific hazard of exposure to death
of mother, father, spouse, and sibling is apparent at most ages
until later in life. Blacks are at greater risk of losing a parent
(mother or father) until their mid-50s, and a spouse or a sibling
through their 80s. The racial disparity in death of a child occurring
after age 50 grows with advancing age without convergence even
at the oldest ages, consistent with the cumulative disadvantage
mechanism. The significantly greater risks for blacks than whites
were robust to controls in Cox regression models (Table S4).
Discussion
This study provides a population-based documentation of earlier and
repeated bereavement experiences for black Americans, who are
more likely to experience the deaths of mothers, fathers, siblings,
spouses, and children and to experience multiple family member
deaths. Moreover, racial differences in exposure to death of mothers,
fathers, and siblings appear early in childhood. By early to mid-
adulthood, racial differences in exposure to the death of children and
spouses are also significant. Understanding exposure to family deaths
from childhood through mid to later life is important because be-
reavement experiences almost certainly add to cumulative disadvan-
tage in multiple life outcomes. Past research has generally focused on
the effects of only one loss on subsequent life outcomes, clearly
demonstrating adverse effects of bereavement on socioeconomic
status, mental health, health behaviors, physical health, and mortality
risk (20). Few studies have considered the impact of repeated be-
reavements (36), and none has focused on racial differences in life
course exposure to the death of family members, which may be
central to processes of cumulative disadvantage associated with race.
Death of family members is highly likely to disrupt and strain other
family relationships as well as the formation, duration, and quality of
relationships across the life course, further contributing to a broad
range of adverse life outcomes (22, 37). Again, bereavement is a
known risk factor for mental and physical health (20), and childhood
through early adulthood may be a period of the life course during
which bereavement is especially likely to have lasting consequences
(14–18). Although the United States has made progress in recent
decades in reducing the life expectancy gap between blacks and whites,
significant racial differences persist (5, 6), with important implications
for surviving family members. Clearly, the most effective strategy for
reducing risk of family member losses for black Americans would be
to eliminate racial disparities in life expectancy, but current patterns of
life expectancy in the United States call for immediate attention to the
extent and impact of loss on surviving family members.
Future research should address limitations of this study and ex-
tend the scope. First, some of the measures of family death relied
on retrospective accounts, which likely underestimated the actual

 number of deaths experienced (38). Second, the datasets we exam-
ined lacked detailed information about family size at different points
in the life course or about family members and family-like friends
beyond parents, children, siblings, and spouses. In light of the im-
portant role of extended kin networks in black communities (39),
future studies should collect information on a broader range of kin
and kin-like ties that may contribute to additional death exposures for
children raised by extended kin. Future work should also consider
other forms of family member loss that vary by race and add to cu-
mulative loss of family members; for example, black children are
much more likely than white children to experience the effects of
parental loss due to incarceration of the parent (40). Third, future
research should go beyond the simple black–white comparison con-
ducted here to consider disparities across diverse populations. Fourth,
this study focused on several age cohorts, but future studies should
investigate the potentially different experiences of a range of cohorts.
Earlier birth cohorts were characterized by greater racial disadvantage
(41), which may have resulted in higher levels of early-life exposure to
death, but family deaths may be even more consequential for later
birth cohorts because these deaths are less expected. Future research
should also consider possible variation in racial patterns of death
exposures based on geographic concentrations of poverty (5) and
violence (42) that may vary across urban/rural and South/non-South
regions as well as across neighborhoods and cities; this approach may
reveal variation in spatial concentrations of disadvantage (43, 44).
Conclusion
Bereavement is a risk factor for varied and interconnected life
outcomes, and black Americans are more likely to experience
the death of multiple family members from childhood through
mid to later life compared with whites. Indeed, experiences of
loss are central themes in African American literature as well as
critical race and black feminist theory (45–48). In this study, we
almost certainly underestimated racial differences in exposure to
death due to lack of information on the deaths of other important
people in black Americans’ lives. The effects of losing nuclear family
members, extended family, friends, and other loved ones may be
further compounded by the highly publicized deaths of black
Americans, especially youth, in the United States. The frequent news
accounts of young black people dying as a result of police shootings
and gang violence almost certainly add to a sense of collective loss
and personal vulnerability (41) as dramatized in decades of poetry,
literature, and nonfiction writings by and about black Americans, and
as underscored in the Black Lives Matter movement. Scholars and
policymakers need to attend to the ways in which such losses have
reverberating effects throughout family networks. Indeed, earlier and
more frequent exposure to death is a distinctive stressor that adds to
racial disparities in overall stress exposure and almost certainly results
in lifelong cumulative disadvantage for children, adults, and families.
Our findings highlight the spiraling damage of racial disparities in life
expectancy and point to the need for interventions and policies that
address bereavement and loss in high-risk populations.
Materials and Methods
We analyzed data from the HRS and the NLSY-97. The HRS is a longitudinal
study of men and women aged 50 and older in the United States who were
not institutionalized at baseline. The study began in 1992 with individuals
born in 1931–1941 and their spouses. Participants have been interviewed
approximately every 2 y since then, and several other cohorts have since
been added to the original HRS participants. Data are publicly available
(hrsonline.isr.umich.edu). The HRS analytic sample included 34,757 respon-
dents who were either non-Hispanic black (n = 6,681) or non-Hispanic white
(n = 28,076). The NLSY-97 follows a nationally representative sample of
youth born 1981–1984. Respondents were interviewed at 16 times points,
from 1997 to 2013–2014. We used data from the baseline survey and from
the most recent data collection in 2013, which are publicly available (https://
www.nlsinfo.org/investigator). The analytic sample included 7,617 youth
who were either non-Hispanic black (n = 2,386) or non-Hispanic white (n =
5,231). The NLSY-97 sample was selected by household; household infor-
mants were asked whether there were any persons for whom the housing
unit was the usual place of residence but who were away from the housing
unit at the time of the survey (e.g., college students, persons in the military,
and persons in prisons or other institutions); imprisoned/institutionalized
respondents were excluded from the analysis. Additional information on
datasets is available in Description of Data and Measures.
Analyses occurred in three steps using Stata. First, we estimated a non-
parametric life table approach to consider whether blacks were at greater
cumulative risk for exposure to specific family member deaths compared with
whites by different ages. An abridged life table was constructed based on
each individual’s age, grouped into 10-y age intervals. The life table esti-
mates are based on the following parameters:
i) The number at risk: the number of individuals at age t who are at risk
for a given family member’s death: lt;
ii) The number of deaths: the number of deaths between ages t and
t + n: ndt = lt – lt+n;
iii) Age-specific hazard: the probability of a given family member’s death
between ages t and t + n: nqt = ndt/lt;
iv) Survival:

We calculated cumulative risk for exposure to family member death by
each age for blacks and whites by assessing the number of deaths that oc-
curred by that age and dividing this by the number of black (or white) re-
spondents in the sample. Then, risk ratios for 10-y intervals (shown in Fig. 1)
were calculated by dividing the risk of blacks by the risk of whites by age t
(i.e., by the time the respondent was age 10, age 20, age 30, etc.).

 Second, we estimated negative binomial regression models predicting
multiple family member death exposures and tested whether blacks were at
greater risk for cumulative death exposures—the total number of deaths
accumulated up to the respondent’s age during the last survey period (Table
2). Count of cumulative death exposures was calculated for all respondents,
including those with missing data on one of the specific deaths considered.
We also estimated logistic regression models and used those results to
illustrate calculated odds of exposure to no family member death or mul-
tiple family member deaths for blacks compared with whites in Fig. 2. All
negative binomial and logistic regression models control for respondent age
at baseline, gender, educational attainment of the respondent’s parents
(measured in years), binary indicators of whether the respondent resided in
the South at baseline, maternal age at respondent’s birth, and household size
at baseline. Given the multicohort design of the HRS and the older age of the

 HRS sample, we also adjust for birth cohort (born before 1924; 1924–1930;
1942–1947, 1948–1953, and 1954–1959), and, given lower life expectancy in
the South, we control for whether the respondent was born in the South.
More detailed geocode data are not publicly available for the HRS and
NLSY-97. Stata’s mi suite of commands do not allow the combination of
survival analysis and weights; therefore, we use listwise deletion. In total, we
deleted 4% of HRS cases and 14% of NLSY-97 cases due to missing data on
mortality, and 9% of HRS cases and 4% of NLSY-97 cases due to missing data
on controls. As a sensitivity check, however, missingness on control variables
was multiply imputed, and results were consistent with those presented.
Third, we evaluated age-specific hazard ratios for black and white ex-
posure to family member death (Figs. 3 and 4) and estimated semiparametric
Cox hazard models to predict black–white disparities in each type of death
including the control variables described above. The hazard function for
individual i at time j is modeled as follows:
h
�
tij
�
= h0
�
tj
�
exp
�
Raceiβl + Z’
iω
�
,
where h(tij) is the hazard of a given family member’s death at the ith indi-
vidual’s age tj, h0(tj) is the baseline hazard function, β1 is the coefficient for
the effect of race (coded 1 for black and 0 for white participants), Zi are
time-invariant control variables, and ω is a vector of parameters. Across
datasets, hazards were estimated for all ages at which data were available
and sufficient sample size was present.
All analyses apply sampling weights appropriate to each dataset, and re-
gression models also adjust for clustering by household in the NLSY-97 and HRS.
Sampling weights were used to adjust for differential probability of selection
into the sample and differential nonresponse. With the use of sampling
weights, the NLSY-97 and HRS are designed to be nationally representative.
We replicated the HRS and NLSY-97 analyses with two additional datasets:
the NLSY-79 and the Add Health; these datasets are described in Description
of Data and Measures, and replication results are provided in Tables S1–S3
and Figs. S1–S4.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. This research uses data from Add Health, a program
project directed by Kathleen Mullan Harris and designed by J. Richard Udry,
Peter S. Bearman, and Kathleen Mullan Harris at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, and funded by Grant P01-HD31921 from the Eunice
Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-
ment, with cooperative funding from 23 other federal agencies and
foundations. Special acknowledgment is due Ronald R. Rindfuss and Barbara
Entwisle for assistance in the original design. Information on how to obtain
the Add Health data files is available on the Add Health website (www.cpc.
unc.edu/projects/addhealth). No direct support was received from Grant P01-
HD31921 for this analysis. We gratefully acknowledge support from an in-
frastructure grant (Grant R24 HD042849) to the Population Research Center
from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development. This research also received support from Grant T32 HD007081,
