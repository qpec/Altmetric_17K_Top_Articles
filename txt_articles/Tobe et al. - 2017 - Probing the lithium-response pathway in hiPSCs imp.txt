The molecular pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BPD) is poorly
understood. Using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to
unravel such mechanisms in polygenic diseases is generally challenging.
However, hiPSCs from BPD patients responsive to lithium offered
unique opportunities to discern lithium’s target and hence gain mo-
lecular insight into BPD. By profiling the proteomics of BDP–hiPSC-
derived neurons, we found that lithium alters the phosphorylation
state of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2). Active non-
phosphorylated CRMP2, which binds cytoskeleton, is present through-
out the neuron; inactive phosphorylated CRMP2, which dissociates
from cytoskeleton, exits dendritic spines. CRMP2 elimination yields ab-
errant dendritogenesis with diminished spine density and lost lithium
responsiveness (LiR). The “set-point” for the ratio of pCRMP2:CRMP2 is
elevated uniquely in hiPSC-derived neurons from LiR BPD patients, but
not with other psychiatric (including lithium-nonresponsive BPD) and
neurological disorders. Lithium (and other pathway modulators) lowers
pCRMP2, increasing spine area and density. Human BPD brains show
similarly elevated ratios and diminished spine densities; lithium therapy
normalizes the ratios and spines. Consistent with such “spine-opathies,”
human LiR BPD neurons with abnormal ratios evince abnormally steep
slopes for calcium flux; lithium normalizes both. Behaviorally, transgenic
mice that reproduce lithium’s postulated site-of-action in dephosphory-
lating CRMP2 emulate LiR in BPD. These data suggest that the “lithium
response pathway” in BPD governs CRMP2’s phosphorylation, which
regulates cytoskeletal organization, particularly in spines, modulating
neural networks. Aberrations in the posttranslational regulation of
this developmentally critical molecule may underlie LiR BPD pathogen-
esis. Instructively, examining the proteomic profile in hiPSCs of a func-
tional agent—even one whose mechanism-of-action is unknown—
might reveal otherwise inscrutable intracellular pathogenic pathways.

lthough human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)
have proven valuable for studying the molecular pathology
of monogenic diseases, one of the technique’s greatest challenges
has been to offer similar insights into the molecular pathogenesis
of polygenic, multifactorial disorders for which the underlying
pathophysiology is unknown. The struggle has been to go beyond
phenotypic description to discerning underlying molecular mech-
anisms. Neuropsychiatric illnesses are a prototype for such com-
plex conditions (1–3). They are difficult to model not only because
of the likelihood of polygenic influences, but also because of the
subjectivity with which these diseases must often be diagnosed, the
empirical fashion with which drugs are prescribed, and the het-
erogeneity of patient response. Of such maladies, bipolar disorder

 (BPD) type 1, a chronic illness of episodic mania with intervening
periods of depression for which the interplay between genetic and
environmental factors is poorly understood, is unique in that, for
unclear reasons, ∼35% of patients respond to monotherapy with
lithium salts (4–7); indeed, lithium responsiveness (LiR) is often
regarded as pathognomic of BPD. However, despite our knowl-
edge of lithium’s ubiquitous multisystemic influences and pleio-
tropic actions (4), the molecular mechanism underlying this drug
responsiveness specifically in BPD, as well as BPD’s molecular
pathogenesis, are poorly understood. The former, however, could
lend insight into the latter. For example, although lithium may
suppress hyperexcitability of a subset of neurons in culture (2) [many
mechanisms have been proffered (4)], clinical trials have shown that
drugs that simply suppress neuronal activity, such as calcium channel
blockers, are ineffective in BPD (7). Furthermore, of the one-third of
patients who are LiR, many become noncompliant because of fre-
quent adverse side effects (e.g., weight gain, hypothyroidism, tremor,
kidney dysfunction, dermatologic reactions, teratogenicity). Such
pleiotropic effects underscore our ignorance with regard to lithium’s
action specifically for BPD. Additionally, the safety index of lithium
is narrow (5, 8). In view of its prevalence (the sixth leading cause of
disability worldwide), suboptimal treatment options, and absence of
biomarkers for onset and progression, neuropsychiatric disorders
in general—and BPD in particular—represent a pressing unmet
medical need (1 in 250 sufferers die from complications of BPD).
Two obstacles to developing safer, more effective mood stabilizers
have been a lack of known clinically relevant molecular drug targets
and of drug-screening assays that are rooted in the molecular
pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder. Although heri-
tability of BPD is ∼80%, few disease-specific gene associations have
been identified with sufficient consistency and statistical significance
to guide further studies (9, 10); multiple loci are more likely to
contribute to LiR than any single reliable genetic marker, making it
challenging for hiPSC disease-modeling technology. The approach
presented here might help address these challenges.
Because most of lithium’s actions have been linked to post-
translational regulation rather than to transcription (4), we elected
to start with an unbiased differential proteomic approach. Thus,
whereas lithium’s action as a modifier of kinase signaling has been
described for numerous substrates (4), precisely how phosphory-
lation plays a role, and what the substrate of that phosphorylation
might be that is relevant to BPD, are not understood. Here we
describe inroads into probing, mapping, and understanding the
regulation of the molecular “lithium-response pathway” in BPD
initially using proteomic profiling (by two independent techniques)
of patient-derived hiPSCs to identify putative lithium targets,
followed by bioinformatic pathway analyses to determine the hi-
erarchy and convergence of these candidates. We validated our
conclusions in: (i) biochemical analyses comparing hiPSC-derived
neurons from LiR, lithium-nonresponsive (LiNR), and unaffected
individuals (as well as those with other psychiatric and neurological
conditions); (ii) assays of neuronal function; (iii) neurocytological
and behavioral analyses of transgenic mice in which the pathway’s
putative central node is eliminated or lithium’s putative site-of-
action is reproduced; and (iv) biochemical and histological as-
sessment of primary human patient brain specimens. Extrapolating
from the mediators of LiR to conclusions regarding the molecular
underpinnings of BPD, our data implicate not a gene defect per
se, but rather aberrant posttranslational modification of a de-
velopmentally critical molecule: an abnormally high phosphor-
egulatory set-point for the central cytoskeletal modulator Collapsin
Response Mediator Protein-2 (CRMP2) (11–16) which, by determining
CRMP2’s active state, in turn influences dendritic form and function
and hence, presumably, neural network development and activity.
Results
We generated hiPSCs from cohorts of LiR and LiNR BPD, and
unaffected patients, which included two sets of first-degree rela-
tives, each set with an LiR patient and an unaffected family
member and one set with a family member with the diagnosis of
unipolar/major depression (MD) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Addi-
tionally, we generated hiPSCs from a patient with Parkinson’s
disease (PD) as a neurologically affected nonpsychiatric control
(SI Appendix, Fig. S1). hiPSC clones (typically duplicates for each
patient sample) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) were validated to confirm
that they: (i) retained a SNP pattern identical to their somatic
cell-of-origin; (ii) were immunopositive for OCT4, NANOG,
SSEA4, and Tra-1-81 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A); (iii) showed gene-
expression profiles consistent with the pluripotent state (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S2B); and (iv) were capable of forming embryoid
bodies or teratomas containing derivatives of the three primitive
germ layers (SI Appendix, Figs. S2 C and D). We observed no
differences in neuronal induction efficiency and yield among
LiR, LiNR, or unaffected patient-derived hiPSCs, all of which
showed similar expression of neuronal markers [Tau, βIII-tubulin
(Tuj1), MAP2, vGLUT, GABA] and produced neural progenitor
cells (NPCs) and electrophysiologically active (17) glutamatergic
(vGLUT+) and GABAergic (GABA+) neurons that initially
expressed markers consistent with a dorsal anterior forebrain cortical
phenotype (SI Appendix, Figs. S2 E–L and S3 A–J) (17–20). For our
in vitro studies, we elected to preserve the distinction made by cli-
nicians between LiR and LiNR patients (5–8) and to probe lithium’s
protein targets within LiR BPD neurons (SI Appendix, Figs. S1).
We began unbiased differential proteomic analysis of a single
clone of BPD hiPSC-derived neurons by comparing lithium treated
to untreated neurons. By 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-
DIGE), we identified 26 differentially represented protein spots
yielding 15 distinct proteins identified by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1A
and SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). The genes corresponding to the 15 pro-
teins were queried against a publicly available human gene-expression
database constructed from the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex of
30 BPD patient brains compared with 31 control patient brains
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS2190):
three genes, whose products changed significantly in response to
lithium in the 2D-DIGE dataset (and hence were candidate lithium
targets), were also differentially expressed in BPD compared with
control brains (P < 0.03): CRMP2, mitochondrial ribosomal protein
S22 (MRPS22), and cystatin B (CSTB). Interrogation of the Sullivan
Lab Evidence Project (SLEP) was performed to indicate proteins
whose encoding genes might already be linked to psychiatric dis-
orders by genome-wide association studies or genetic linkages. In-
terrogation of SLEP (<50 kb for linkage, P < 1 × 10−3 for genome-
wide association studies, logarithm of the odds score of 3) showed
microsatellite enrichment of 4 of the 15 protein-encoding genes—
CRMP2, WD repeat and FYVE domain containing protein-1
(WDFY1), and reticulocalbin-1 (RCN1)—and SNP enrichment of
two: nuclear transport factor-2 (NUTF2) and RCN1. Finally, be-
cause, 8p21 has been implicated as a susceptibility locus for
schizophrenia (21–23), genes linked to that region have also been
Significance
One-third of bipolar disorder (BPD) patients are lithium-responsive
(LiR) for unknown reasons. Were lithium’s target to be identified,
then BPD’s pathogenesis might be unraveled. We identified and
mapped the “lithium-response pathway,” which governs the
phosphorylation of CRMP2, a cytoskeleton regulator, particularly
for dendritic spines: hence, a neural network modulator. Although
“toggling” between inactive (phosphorylated) and active (non-
phosphorylated) CRMP2 is physiologic, the “set-point” in LiR BPD
is abnormal. Lithium (and other pathway-modulators) normalize
that set-point. Hence, BPD is a disorder not of a gene but of the
posttranslational regulation of a developmentally critical mole-
cule. Such knowledge should enable better mechanistically based
treatments and bioassays. Instructively, lithium was our “molec-
ular can-opener” for “prying” intracellularly to reveal otherwise
inscrutable pathophysiology in this complex polygenic disorder.

 viewed as risk factors for psychiatric disease more broadly, although
the mechanism by which they might predispose to a mental disorder
is unknown (21–23). Among the 2D-DIGE candidate proteins, only
CRMP2 is encoded within chromosomal region 8p22-21.
The 2D-DIGE candidates were then subjected to Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA), as well as modeling with the STRING
Network tool (string-db.org) to generate a canonical pathway
dendrogram that might indicate the functional relationships be-
tween gene products using gene ontology terms (SI Appendix, Fig.
S4B). This analysis revealed that lithium treatment of human neurons
appears to modulate four pathways significantly: semaphorin (SEMA)
signaling in neurons, uracil degradation II (reductive), thymine deg-
radation, and axonal guidance signaling. We noted that CRMP2 was a
constituent of each of the four pathways. Additionally, axonal guid-
ance signaling appeared most centralized; its function connected with
75% of the pathways identified in the IPA analysis. Of the 15 candi-
date protein targets, the one most pivotal to axonal guidance and
cytoskeletal dynamics was CRMP2, originally discovered as the me-
diator of Sema3A’s (initially named “collapsin”) guidance of neurite
extension and axonal growth cone development (5–11).
Given the converging proteomic and bioinformatics results, we
focused on CRMP2 (a central node in cytoskeletal dynamics). It
is known that phosphorylation of CRMP2 at threonine (T) 514
(CRMP2-p-T514) causes its dissociation from cytoskeletal pro-
teins (e.g., tubulin heterodimers) (24–26). However, phosphory-
lation of CRMP2-T514 (as well as of CRMP2-S518 and CRMP2-
T509) must first be primed by phosphorylation at CRMP2-S522.
Phosphorylation of CRMP2 by kinases is balanced by its de-
phosphorylation by phosphatases (24–26) (Fig. 1B). (Note: Although
lithium is known to have numerous targets, these 2D-DIGE experi-
ments were designed to highlight ideally only those that differed
specifically in BPD in response to lithium; those targets that were not
specifically relevant to BPD would cancel each other out.)
IPA of the 2D-DIGE results showed the lithium-response
pathway in BPD neurons overlaps significantly with the glycogen
synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) signaling axis, reinforcing presump-
tions that GSK3β is a major node upstream of CRMP2 (15), and
suggesting that phosphorylation of CRMP2 at T514 is significantly
influenced, although not necessarily exclusively, by GSK3β, a known
substrate of lithium-mediated inhibition (but not the paralog
GSK3α) (27). Therefore, we next questioned whether CRMP2 is
the primary GSK3β substrate in BPD hiPSC neurons, or if addi-
tional substrates downstream of GSK3β may be involved. Sur-
prisingly, bioinformatic analysis revealed that none of the other
15 candidates from our 2D-DIGE analysis contained GSK3β
phosphorylation sites, suggesting that CRMP2 may be the major
direct downstream effector of GSK3β in the specific context of
human NPCs and neurons, particularly from BPD patients.
To further ascertain the extent of the molecular consequences
of GSK3β inhibition within neural cells, we used “stable isotope
labeling by amino acids in cell culture” (SILAC)-labeled (28) hiPSC-
derived neural cells with a highly specific GSK3β inhibitor,
CHIR99021, and compared proteolytic digests of treated and un-
treated cells using high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify differentially
enriched peptides and proteins (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). As expected,
CRMP2-p-T514 peptide was substantially reduced by CHIR99021 (SI
Appendix, Fig. S5A). Of putative GSK3β substrates, CRMP2 was
among the most robust in terms of overall peptide coverage and dose-
dependency. Overall, these data suggested that CRMP2 is a primary
mediator of GSK3β-dependent lithium action in human neurons.
We next monitored the time course of CRMP2 and CRMP2-p-
T514 levels during differentiation of hiPSCs to neurons. Interestingly,
CRMP2-p-T514 is largely restricted to NPCs and neurons, and most
abundant in the latter (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). Note that CRMP2-p-
T514 in these neural lineages evolves into three isoforms of slightly
different molecular weight, known to result from transcription initi-
ation from alternate start codons, although all transcripts maintain
the coding region for the phospho-motif containing T514. [Only
isoform 2 shows any detectable phosphorylation in hiPSCs, likely
reflecting the microtubule-dependence of the reprogramming process
(29).] Isoform 3 (the top, heaviest band in SI Appendix, Fig. S6A)
appears most pertinent to neural lineages, does not appear until the
NPC stage, increases with maturation, and appears in our hands to be
the one most influenced by lithium and CHIR99021 treatment;
hence, we focused on the phospho-state of that isoform.
These findings prompted us to study in greater detail the
phosphoregulation of CRMP2 in hiPSC-derived neurons, with an
eye toward discerning how lithium interposes itself upon that
Fig. 1.
CRMP2 appears to be the central node in the lithium-response pathway
in hiPSC-derived neurons from LiR BPD patients. (A) Differential proteomic
analysis by 2D-DIGE of BPD patient hiPSC-derived neurons identified CRMP2 as a
target of lithium. Patient-derived dermal fibroblasts were reprogrammed into
hiPSCs and differentiated to cortical interneurons (17). (Scale bar: 400 μm, Top;
200 μm, Bottom.) Neurons from a single clone were treated or left untreated
with LiCl [red (Cy3) and green (Cy5), respectively], and then subjected to 2D-DIGE,
separating proteins based on their molecular weight, charge, and degree of
enrichment under each condition. In an overlay of gels, proteins unchanged in
response to LiCl fluoresce both green and red, and hence, look yellow; proteins
altered by LiCl fluoresce solely red or solely green. Differential protein spots
(encircled white) were picked and identified by MS (SI Appendix, Fig. S2), with
spots #2 and #5 (enlarged) identified as CRMP2. (B) Proposed model of the
lithium-response pathway in BPD, regulating CRMP2’s phosphorylation-state
and, hence, its association with cytoskeletal elements. The proposed action of
lithium in this context—as mediated by its presumptive direct and indirect targets
(black lines radiating from lithium working in concert) (Figs. 2 and 3 and SI Ap-
pendix, Figs. S6–S10)—is to promote dephosphorylation of CRMP2 at T514: that
is, to reduce the CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 ratio, the set-point for which, we pro-
pose, is excessively high in LiR BPD (Figs. 2, 3 D and F, and 5 and SI Appendix, Figs.
S10 and S12). It does so through both GSK3β-dependent and independent routes.
Putative components: phosphorylation of CRMP2 at T514 inactivates CRMP2, such
that it dissociates from cytoskeletal molecules (e.g., tubulin heterodimers). That
phosphorylation, as well as at S518, T509, and T555 (suggested by IPA analysis to be
by GSK3β), must first be “primed” by phosphorylation of S522 (believed to be
mediated by CDK5). Phosphorylation of CRMP2 by kinases is balanced by its de-
phosphorylation by phosphatases (e.g., PP2A, which must be released by i2PP2A
and complexed with β-arrestin-2 to function). Lithium can inactivate GSK3β by
promoting its phosphorylation at S9 or by increasing p-AKT that can also phospho-
inactivate GSK3β. Lithium can also block phosphorylation of S522 or increase
phosphatase (PP2A) action. [Not schematized: The influence of PP2A/β-arrestin-
2 complexes on AKT in the GSK3β-dependent portion of the schematic (30).]

 regulation (Fig. 1B). We therefore began our delineation of the
lithium-response pathway to and from CRMP2 by applying lithium
to neurons derived from LiR BPD hiPSCs compared with LiNR
BPD and unaffected patients, as well compared with other psy-
chiatric and nonpsychiatric neurological conditions (e.g., MD and PD,
respectively). (The patients used in the specific experiments described
are specified in the appropriate figure legends, in SI Appendix, Sup-
plementary Methods and in the table in SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
We found by immunostaining (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S6B)
and Western blotting (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig. S6C) that
lithium significantly decreased CRMP-p-T514 in all hiPSC-derived
NPCs (Fig. 3B) and neurons, but without significant effect on
nonphosphorylated or the total level of CRMP2 protein (Figs. 2A
and 3 A and C–E, and SI Appendix, Figs. S3K, S6 B and C, S10, and
S11). The effect of LiCl on CRMP-p-T514 was not emulated
by other chloride salts: for example, NaCl or MgCl2 (SI Appendix,
Fig. S6C). We reasoned that, if lithium lowers CRMP2-p-T514, at
least in part, by inhibiting downstream GSK3β, then direct appli-
cation of a GSK3β inhibitor (e.g., CHIR99021) should similarly
lower CRMP2-p-T514 abundance, reducing the CRMP2-p-T514:
CRMP2 ratio. This was found to be the case by SILAC (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S5), immunocytochemical (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig.
S7), and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3), starting as early as the NPC
stage (Fig. 3B) and persisting into the more mature neuronal stage
(Figs. 2 and 3 A and C–E, and SI Appendix, Figs. S5A and S7).
[Suppression of isoform 3 at the developmentally earlier NPC
stage (Fig. 3B) appears more complete than in neurons because
βIII-tubulin is less abundant in NPCs (Fig. 3A).] LiCl increased the
inactive form of GSK3β (GSK3β-p-S9) (30) (within 1 h of expo-
sure) (Fig. 3A), and both LiCl and direct GSK3β inhibition de-
creased CRMP2-p-T514 in a dose-dependent manner, but not
total CRMP2 levels (Figs. 3 A–C and SI Appendix, Figs. S5A and
S10C). All inhibitors of GSK3β tested (including CHIR99021,
SB216763, and SB415286) lowered CRMP2-p-T514; CHIR99021
had the greatest effect and is the most selective of the three
compounds (Fig. 3F). As per the model in Fig. 1B, the reduction of
CRMP2-p-T514 (by lithium or GSK3β inhibition) restores the
association of CRMP2 with tubulin in BPD hiPSC-derived neurons
(without affecting total tubulin) based on coimmunoprecipitation
pull-down experiments (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
Finally, further fleshing out lithium’s putative interposition
upon the phosphoregulation of CRMP2 in hiPSC neural deriv-
atives, we observed that LiCl increased the active AKT phospho-
form, AKT-p-T308 (SI Appendix, Fig. S9A), for which GSK3β-
S9 is a known substrate, hence indirectly decreasing GSK3β’s
activity because pf elevation of GSK3β-p-S9 levels.
Although inhibition of GSK3β is a prominent node in the
lithium-response pathway’s reduction of CRMP2-p-T514, we ob-
served LiCl treatment also resulted in a reduction of phosphory-
lation at CRMP2-S522 (and subsequent decrease in CRMP2-
p-T514) (SI Appendix, Fig. S9B), implicating other parallel (or
additive) GSK3β-independent lithium interactions (Fig. 1B). In-
terestingly, inhibitors of CDK5 (cyclin-dependent kinase-5), the
presumed S522 kinase that primes other CRMP2 sites for subsequent
GSK3β phosphorylation (25), did not decrease CRMP2-p-T514,
suggesting that lithium decreases CRMP2-p-S522 independently of
CDK5 in human neurons (SI Appendix, Fig. S9C).
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (26, 27) dephosphorylates
CRMP2 as a counterpoise to the kinases (Fig. 1B), Among the
15 putative lithium candidates revealed by 2D-DIGE, i2PP2A, an
inhibitor of PP2A, was decreased 1.5-fold in response to lithium
(SI Appendix, Fig. S4A), suggesting that lithium relieves inhibition
of PP2A, thereby decreasing CRMP2-p-T514. Following its dis-
sociation from i2PP2A, PP2A requires binding to β-arrestin-2 for
it to be active (26, 27); lithium increased β-arrestin-2 levels (SI
Appendix, Fig. S9D). LiCl does not alter the phosphorylation of
CRMP2-p-T555, the kinase for which is Rho-associated protein
kinase. Finally, we also assessed the possibility that lithium may
affect other upstream interactors of CRMP2. However, neither
lithium nor CHIR99021 altered protein levels of SEMA3A
(CRMP2’s most prominent upstream partner) (SI Appendix, Fig.
S9E) nor the tyrosine kinase YES1.
We next determined whether these actions on CRMP2 regu-
lation (i.e., decreasing CRMP2-p-T514 in hiPSC-derived neurons)
was specific to lithium among mood-stabilizing medications. In
contrast to lithium, other psychotropic agents, including those
routinely used clinically in LiNR BPD patients and other psychiatric
disorders (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, clozapine, valproic acid),
did not similarly reduce CRMP2-p-T514 (Fig. 3G). Furthermore, of
these drugs, only lithium appeared to increase phosphorylation of
GSK3β-S9, thereby inhibiting GSK3β action (Fig. 3G).
“Toggling” between active and inactive CRMP2 is a normal phys-
iologic process speculated to facilitate corticogenic lamination during
development and to inhibit abnormal sprouting following acute CNS
trauma (12, 13, 16, 24). Accordingly, it was not unexpected that
lithium reduced CRMP2-p-T514 (and hence the CRMP2-p-T514:
CRMP2 ratio) in all hiPSC-derived NPCs and neurons regardless of
the donor patient’s diagnosis, including unaffected individuals with no
psychiatric or neurologic disease (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Strikingly, the

 baseline level of CRMP2-p-T514 was significantly higher in hiPSC-
derived neurons from LiR BPD patients compared with those from
other individuals, including those with LiNR BPD. Even at the single
human neuron level, quantitative analysis of the intracellular immu-
nofluorescence signal demonstrated a significantly higher baseline level
of CRMP2-p-T514 immunoreactivity within BPD compared with un-
affected neurons (Fig. 2). Intriguingly, lithium treatment, as well as
GSK3β inhibition, of BPD neurons reduced elevated CRMP2-p-
T514 levels to that of normal neurons (Fig. 2B).
To test the generalizability of this observation in hiPSC-derived
neurons across many patient samples, we extended our study to
semiquantitative Western blot analysis of the CRMP2-p-T514:
CRMP2 ratios across a spectrum of conditions and patients (Fig.
3 and SI Appendix, Figs. S1, S10, and S11): again, CRMP2-p-
T514 was abnormally high in LiR BPD neurons in contrast to
neurons from unaffected patients, patients with other neuropsy-
chiatric disorders (e.g., MD, including first-degree relatives of
LiR BPD patients), other neurologic diseases (e.g., PD), and
strikingly, even LiNR BPD. Again, although lithium (and GSK3β
inhibition) decreased CRMP2-p-T514 in hiPSC-derived neurons
from all patients (without altering CRMP2), abnormally high
CRMP2-p-T514 levels in LiR BPD were reduced to a level ap-
proximating the baseline level of unaffected individuals, which, in
turn, was not significantly different from the baseline levels in
patients with LiNR BPD, MD, and Parkinsonism. Hence, an ab-
normally high CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 ratio appeared to be disease-
specific, prompting the hypothesis that the set-point for the CRMP2-
p-T514:CRMP2 ratio may be abnormally high in LiR BPD and, at
least with respect to hiPSC-based analysis, a molecular hallmark of
LiR BPD (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, we did not observe decreased
baseline levels of GSK3β-p-S9 in LiR BPD cells. Given that
CRMP2 is a GSK3β substrate, one explanation for an abnormally
high inactive CRMP2-p-T514 might be that the inactive inhibitory
form of GSK3β (i.e., GSK3β-p-S9) is simply too low, allowing GSK3β
levels to rise, and hence rendering the observation of an elevated
CRMP2-p-T514 as just the manifestation of a GSK3β problem.
However, in not finding decreased baseline levels of GSK3β-p-S9 in
LiR BPD cells, the abnormal regulation of CRMP2 (a central actor in
its own right) must be attributable to additional converging upstream
pathways independent of GSK3β regulation (Fig. 3E).
Given these observations from hiPSCs in vitro, we next needed
to (i) validate their relevance to actual primary patient specimens
(Fig. 4), as well as (ii) determine what physiological relevance
CRMP2 might have to BPD (Figs. 5–7). These investigations were
pursued in parallel, the latter providing guidance as to what
metrics should be assessed in the former.
Because determining CRMP2’s role in neurons in situ entails
experimental manipulations in living systems not feasible in humans
Fig. 3.
Western analyses show that the baseline
CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 ratio is higher in LiR BPD than in
unaffected or LiNR BPD neurons (although GSK3β-p-S9:
GSK3β is not reduced), and is normalized by LiCl (an
action replicated by direct GSK3β inhibition but not by
other psychotropic drugs) and, in so doing, promotes
reassociation of CRMP2 with cytoskeletal elements. (A)
LiCl reduces CRMP2-p-T514 (but not CRMP2) in mature
hiPSC-derived BPD neurons in part by inhibiting (phos-
phorylating) GSK3β-S9 (orange arrow). Decreased T514-
CRMP2 phosphorylation is most prominent in isoform 3
(Top band; red arrow), the isoform most pertinent to
neural lineages. (Data are shown for patient Pt-LiR-1,
although similar results were observed for all clones
from at least eight patients examined in this manner:
Pt-LiR-2, Pt-LiR-3, Pt-LiR4, Pt-UC-1, Pt-UC-2, Pt-UC-3, Pt-
UC-4; six biological replicates, each with two technical
replicates. See SI Appendix, Fig. S1 for patient infor-
mation.) Neuronal protein was normalized to neuron-
specific enolase (NSE; which also served as the loading
control) to eliminate confounding protein contami-
nants. (B) LiCl’s suppression of CRMP2 phosphoryla-
tion starts as early as the NPC stage shown here, an
action matched by direct chemical inhibition of GSK3β
with CHIR99021. Only isoform 3 is shown, suppression
of which, at this younger stage, is more complete
because βIII-tubulin is less abundant than in neurons. (C) Reduction of CRMP2-p-T514 (red arrow) increases CRMP2’s association with tubulin in BPD hiPSC-derived neurons,
as illustrated here by increased coimmunoprecipitation of CRMP2 and tubulin (green arrow) in a manner not seen under high CRMP2-p-T514 conditions. (Performed on all
clones from Pt-LiR-1, Pt-LiR-3, Pt-UC-2, Pt-UC-1, Pt-UC-6; two technical replicates each.) See also SI Appendix, Fig. S8. (D) Across multiple patients, the baseline CRMP2-p-T514:
CRMP2 ratio is higher in LiR BPD neurons (red arrow) than in neurons from unaffected or LiNR BPD patients (the latter approximating each other). Lithium reduced CRMP2-
p-T514 in all patient groups (see SI Appendix, Figs. S10 and S11 for expanded data), and hence, by shifting the balance away from phosphorylated CRMP2, established a
lower CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 ratio in LiR BPD neurons now comparable to the baseline of untreated unaffected control neurons (green arrow). (Western blot in F is
representative of the primary data from which pixel intensity was measured, normalized to NSE, and ratios calculated. Western blots in F are representative of the primary
data from which pixel intensity was measured, normalized to NSE, and ratios calculated. Statistics based on Pt-UC-2, Pt-UC-3, Pt-UC-4, Pt-LiR-2, Pt-LiR-3, Pt-LiR-4, Pt-LiR-5,
Pt-LiNR-1, Pt-LiNR-2, Pt-LiNR-3, each with three technical replicates; t test; *P < 0.0001; ns, not significant in D and E.) (E) Inhibitory S9 phosphorylation of GSK3β was
increased in all neurons treated with LiCl. However, surprisingly, across the same patients as in D, baseline GSK3β-p-S9:GSK3β ratios did not differ. Given that CRMP2 is a
GSK3β substrate, one explanation for the abnormally high baseline inactive CRMP2-p-T514 seen in D might have been that baseline GSK3β-p-S9 is too low, allowing GSK3β
levels to rise, and hence elevating CRMP2-p-T514 in LiR BPD neurons: that is, a manifestation solely of GSK3β dysregulation. However, in the absence of decreased baseline
GSK3β-p-S9 in those neurons, their abnormal regulation of CRMP2 must be attributable to upstream pathways independent of GSK3β regulation (Fig. 1B; see also SI
Appendix, Fig. S10). (F) Representative Western blot on which the statistical analyses in D were performed, suggesting that the baseline CRMP2-p-T514 level in LiR BPD
patients is higher than normal (red arrow), but that lithium exposure or GSK3β inhibition (shown here) reduces it to a level as low (or lower than) that in untreated
unaffected patients (green arrows). (The patients shown here—Pt-LiR-1 and Pt-UC-1—are first-degree relatives.) High baseline CRMP2-p-T514 is not seen in LiNR BPD (D), in
other psychiatric disorders (e.g., MD; another first-degree relative with MD is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S11), or in other neurologic disorder [e.g., PD (SI Appendix, Fig.
S11)], which have levels no higher than in unaffected patients, suggesting that elevated ratios have disease-specificity. All GSK3β inhibitors tested (CHIR99021, SB216763,
SB415286) lowered CRMP2-p-T514; CHIR99021, the most specific, had the greatest impact. (G) Western analyses of hiPSC-derived neurons suggest that
CRMP2-p-T514 reduction (without altering CRMP2) and GSK3β inhibition by increased S9 phosphorylation are drug-specific actions of lithium (red box), but not of other
mood-stabilizing agents often prescribed for LiNR BPD (risperidone and haloperidol shown). (Shown are representative patients Pt-UC-1 and Pt-LiR-1, each with two
technical replicates, but applies also to all clones from Pt-LiR-2, Pt-LiR-3, Pt-LiR4, Pt-UC-2, Pt-UC-3, Pt-UC-4. See SI Appendix, Fig. S1 for patient information.)

 or human postmortem material and beyond the state-of-the-art for
hiPSCs (e.g., high-resolution dendrite and dendritic spine mor-
phometrics), we turned to rodents for a series of studies to provide
guidance. We performed an immunohistochemical survey of the
intact adult mouse brain and determined that CRMP2 is highly
expressed in neurons of the hippocampus (e.g., CA1 pyramidal
neurons) (Fig. 6A), cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum
(Purkinje neurons), regions postulated to be involved in BPD (31).
We verified that, as was seen in BPD hiPSC-derived neurons in
vitro, lithium administration to mice increases the inactive form of
GSK3β (GSK3β-p-S9) and lowers CRMP2-p-T514 in vivo (Fig.
6B). We next eliminated CRMP2 function systemically by gener-
ating a constitutive CRMP2-KO mouse strain (recognizing that
CRMP2 is also expressed in nonneural systems and that lithium is a
systemically administered drug). In contrast to a brain-specific
CRMP2-deleted mouse generated contemporaneously (32), these
animals had grossly normal bodies and brains (as per actual BPD
patients), except for a unique dendrite aberrancy: The brains of adult
CRMP2-KO mice were characterized by a fivefold increase in bi-
furcation of apical dendrites proximally (creating increased dendritic
branching points at the expense of main trunk dendrites) (33) (Fig. 6
C and D). Prominent as well was the loss of dendritic spine density
(25% fewer spines in CRMP2-KO mice compared with WT) (Fig. 6
E and F). These perturbations in dendritogenesis prompted us to
examine the subcellular localization of CRMP2 in neurons, partic-
ularly in relation to its phosphorylation state as modified by lithium.
(Examining the dendritic arbor of primary hippocampal neurons in
situ across the stratum radiatum is regarded as the most valid and
reproducible system for rigorously evaluating anatomical dendritic
spine parameters and cannot yet be reproduced in cell culture.)
An antibody that detects CRMP2 independent of phosphoryla-
tion state showed that CRMP2 was expressed throughout the
neuron, including the dendritic shaft, branches, and spines (Fig.
6G). In contrast, inactive CRMP2-p-T514, which dissociates from
tubulin, was not detectable in dendritic spines (Fig. 6G), suggesting
that, when CRMP2 becomes phosphorylated (i.e., inactivated), it
exits or is excluded from the spines. LiCl administration, however,
which, as noted above, decreases the proportion of phosphorylated
inactive CRMP2 in vitro and in vivo (hence increasing the amount
of active CRMP2), induced a 60% increase in dendritic spine area
(Figs. 6 H and I) and a 36% increase in spine density. This lithium
response is lost in CRMP2-null neurons (an informative loss-of-
function observation) (Fig. 6J). (Interestingly, CRMP2-KO mice
are hyperactive and overanxious in stressful environments and show
briefer social interactions compared with WT littermates).
Given that subcellular localization of CRMP2 (based on its
lithium-modifiable phosphorylation state) might influence den-
dritic spine regulation, we next sought validation in actual human
BPD patients (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S12). Our prediction
was that, in BPD patients, levels of inactive CRMP2-p-T514 would
be abnormally high and that, accordingly (as in the CRMP-KO
mouse), dendritic spine densities would be diminished (compared
with unaffected patients). First we performed Western blot anal-
ysis on protein preparations from primary postmortem brains of
BPD patients. Indeed, CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 ratios were ele-
vated in samples from unmedicated BPD compared with un-
affected patients, suggesting that CRMP2 might be aberrantly
regulated (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Fig. S12). Next we observed
cytoarchitecturally that BPD patients, compared with unaffected
patients, had diminished dendritic spine densities (Fig. 4A), a
picture reminiscent of that seen in the CRMP-KO mouse (Fig. 6 E
and F). As presented in Fig. 4 B–F, we next determined that there
was a moderately strong coefficient-of-correlation (0.61) between
abnormally elevated CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 ratios in BPD pa-
tient brains (compared with brains of unaffected patients with
lower ratios) and diminished dendritic spine density and decreased
dendritic length [a metric of excess proximal branching, as per the
CRMP2-KO mice (Fig. 6 C and D)] in those brains. As further
shown in Fig. 4 E and F, LiR BPD patients placed on lithium had a
decrease in their levels of CRMP2-p-T514 toward normal ratios, as
well as an improvement in dendritic spine density such that it was no
longer significantly different from unaffected individuals, again with a
moderately strong correlation, suggesting (within the limitations of
assessing archived postmortem material) that lithium treatment
might have a normalizing influence in LiR BPD patients on both
CRMP2 ratios and dendritic spine abnormalities that appear linked.
At a minimum, these data support the hypothesis that the set-point
for CRMP2-p-T514 is higher than normal in LiR BPD patients.
Whereas actual primary patient specimens provide the ultimate
histopathologic and biochemical validation, because one cannot glean
functionality from postmortem material, we turned again to living
human neurons derived from BPD patient hiPSCs. Diminished
dendritic spine density, as seen in primary human neurons in situ in
BPD patient pathological specimens, predicts that there should be
altered regulation of intracellular Cai
2+ transients within individual
neurons (i.e., more rapid calcium flux) (34, 35). Altered calcium dy-
namics has long been suspected in BPD (2, 36), although calcium

Excessively elevated CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 ratios are associated with di-
minished dendritic spine morphology in primary human postmortem specimens,
both of which are improved by lithium. Shown are data from the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex of BPD patients (n = 9 patients) in which CRMP2-p-T514 ratios
(by Western blot) were observed to correlate with dendritic spine morphologies
(based on Golgi stain analysis). (A) Golgi-stained dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
from a representative BPD and unaffected patient showing diminished spine
density in the former. (Compare with similar data from the CRMP2-KO mouse in
Fig. 6 E and F.) (Scale bar: 0.3 μm, Upper and 0.15 μm, Lower.) The average
CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 ratio was significantly (*) increased (P = 0.01) (B) and the
dendritic length (P = 0.011) (C) and spine density (P = 0.003) (D) were significantly
(*) reduced in BPD patients not treated with lithium compared with unaffected
individuals (n = 5 and n = 16, respectively). Diminished dendritic spine density had
a moderately strong coefficient-of-correlation of 0.61 with the elevated ratio.
Treatment of BPD patients with lithium (n = 4 patients) provided a normalizing
effect for both decreasing the ratio (E) and increasing spine density (F), such that
they were no longer significantly different from unaffected patients (“ns”). Note
that spine density was confirmed by two separate measurements which were in
agreement: “number of spines per dendrite” and “number of spines per 100-μm
dendrite length.” (See also biochemical data in SI Appendix, Fig. S12.)

 channel blockers have proved clinically ineffective as a mono-
therapy for this condition (13), speaking against hyperexcitability
as the primary target of LiR (2). Although previous studies looked
at the total number of firings of populations of neurons over a
given period (2), we sought to analyze Cai
2+ flux in individual
LiR BPD neurons (Fig. 5A) with abnormally high CRMP2-p-
T514 levels (as per Fig. 2). Cai
2+ imaging of LiR BPD hiPSC-
derived neurons (Fig. 5 B–D) showed a more rapid ingress and
egress of Ca2+, reflected as steeper slopes (35, 36), compared with
neurons from LiNR and unaffected patients (the latter two ap-
proximating each other) (Fig. 5 B–D and Movie S1), as would be
expected under conditions of diminished spine density. In other
words, LiR BPD neurons flux Cai
2+ at a greater rate; they not only
fire and resolve at a quicker rate, as shown by graphs of their rise/
influx and decay/efflux slopes, but also have a more intense firing
as shown by their amplitudes (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Lithium
administration to the LiR BPD neurons shifted their slopes to
approximate those of the other two categories of patient-derived
neurons, unaffected and LiNR BPD (Fig. 5 C and D). In other
words, the LiR BPD neurons’ Cai
2+ influx, efflux, and amplitude
now showed a significant reduction toward normal.
Given its regulation by lithium, we next questioned whether
CRMP2 may be required for lithium-mediated behavioral changes
in widely accepted animal models of LiR BPD. One such model
is methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion/mania, which is
known to be responsive to lithium in many mouse strains (37).
Interestingly, although no molecular mechanisms have been of-
fered, methamphetamine has also been suspected of modulating
GSK3β signaling in the nucleus accumbens (38), impinging on
dendritic spine formation (39) and effecting Ca2+ channel ex-
pression (40). We therefore questioned whether methamphet-
amine may also influence CRMP2 ratios (Fig. 7 A–D). Indeed, we
observed that treatment of primary rat hippocampal neurons in
vitro with methamphetamine (hence independent of dopamine
handling) (Fig. 7A), as well as administration of methamphet-
amine to mice in vivo, significantly increased the proportion of
phosphorylated CRMP2 (both CRMP2-p-S522 and CRMP2-p-
T415) without influencing total CRMP2, hence increasing the
inactive:active CRMP2 ratio (Fig. 7 B–D). Methamphetamine
administration to normal mice provokes characteristic LiR BPD
behavior, including manic exploring of the periphery of an open field
with little time spent in the unprotected center (37). We predicted
that, were the lithium-response pathway in BPD to be one that con-
verges on inhibiting CRMP2-p-T514, then the behavior of a mouse in
which CRMP2 is incapable of being phosphorylated at that motif
(CRMP2ki/ki)—lithium’s
postulated site-of-action—would emulate
chronic lithium treatment (Fig. 7C). Indeed, CRMP2ki/ki mice failed to
experience methamphetamine-mediated phosphorylation of CRMP2
(Fig. 7D) and were resistant to functional methamphetamine provo-
cation, abrogating LiR BPD-like behaviors (peripheral circling, mania,
hyperlocomotion) in contrast to methamphetamine-exposed WT mice
(Fig. 7 E–H) (which would require lithium treatment). This observa-
tion (both a critical loss-of-function and reproduction-of-function ex-
periment) suggested that CRMP2 phosphorylation is required, at least
in part, for methamphetamine-induced BPD-like mania, lending fur-
ther support to our model of BPD pathogenesis based on aberrant
CRMP2 phosphoregulation and lithium’s therapeutic modification of
it at that motif (Fig. 1B).
Discussion
In summary, through a combination of unbiased, differential pro-
teomic and bioinformatic pathway analyses of hiPSC-derived NPCs
and neurons from LiR BPD patients (and control patients with
other disorders, including LiNR BPD and other psychiatric and
neurological conditions), followed by node-by-node mapping, ani-
mal modeling, functional validation in vitro and in vivo, and cor-
roboration in human BPD postmortem brains, our results suggest
that the molecular lithium-response pathway in BPD acts via
CRMP2 to alter neuronal cytoskeletal dynamics, most particularly
dendrite and dendritic spine formation, and presumably function:
hence, neural network development and activity. By “mapping” the
upstream and downstream interactors of CRMP2, we observed
that lithium does not impact its direct upstream activator, collapsin
(SEMA3A), but does regulate GSK3β and AKT kinases, the
arrestin–PP2A complex, and hence, the phospho-sites (e.g., T514,
S522) that govern CRMP2’s central role in cytoskeleton regulation.
The phosphorylation state of CRMP2 (influenced by both GSK3β-
dependent and -independent pathways) determines its association
with cytoskeletal elements: nonphosphorylated active CRMP2
binds them, phosphorylated inactive CRMP2 dissociates from
them. Our observations in hiPSCs and then in human postmortem
brain specimens suggests that the inactive CRMP2-p-T514:active
CRMP2 ratio set-point is uniquely elevated in LiR BPD patients.
Lithium lowers this ratio to a level observed in unaffected patients.
Nullifying CRMP2 function entirely by KO elicits dendrite and
spine pathology. It also eliminates lithium’s increase of spine
density. Abrogating phosphorylation of CRMP2 at lithium’s pos-
tulated site of action, hence emulating lithium’s proposed action,
also reproduces lithium’s therapeutic action in accepted behav-
ioral models of LiR BPD. Data from primary BPD patient brains

higher (*P < 0.01) than those in LiNR and unaffected neurons, which are not
significantly different (“ns”) from each other. LiCl treatment makes the influx
and efflux slopes for LiR BPD patient neurons decrease to match those of the
unaffected and LiNR neurons, eliminating any statistical differences between
disease categories (“ns”). Additional data presented in SI Appendix, Fig. S13.

 further confirm the predicted link between abnormally elevated
CRMP2-p-T514 and dendritic spine abnormalities, as well as ev-
idence that lithium treatment of patients acts to normalize both
CRMP2 ratios and dendritic spine density and length.
We emphasize that these actions of lithium in BPD do not rule
out potential roles for that cation’s multiple other actions (4–7),
which may function additively or synergistically in this condition.
We now simply identify a promising regulatable molecular path-
way upon which to focus etiologically and pharmacologically.
Elevated baseline CRMP2-p-T514 might be associated with LiR
as a clinical classification of BPD (potentially a biomarker). (Pro-
spective studies in large cohorts of living patients will inevitably
be required to help define what the critical clinical threshold
for a CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 ratio should be.) Our data cannot
yet determine whether the CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 set-point is
chronically high in LiR BPD patients or rather that the response of
LiR BPD patients to stimuli that increase CRMP2-p-T514 is more
pronounced, prolonged, or of earlier onset than in unaffected pa-
tients, or a combination of these. Nevertheless, these results may
provide impetus for biomarker assay development, for example
measuring CRMP2-p-T514:CRMP2 ratios in reprogrammed
patient-derived cells (including those obtained from the peripheral
blood, like some of ours) as a diagnostic aid to predict drug
responsiveness. A qualitative, not just quantitative, distinction be-
tween LiR and LiNR BPD based on an abnormally high set-point for
an otherwise physiologic posttranslational modification of a cytoskeletal
regulator (uniquely in LiR BPD) invites speculation that LiNR BPD is
actually a separate disease that “pheno-copies” BPD but is unrelated

CRMP2 function is pivotal for proper dendritic
branching and spine organization in vivo. (A) Representative
photomicrographs from an immunohistochemical survey of the
adult mouse brain determining the regions and cell types
expressing phosphorylated CRMP2 in situ. Shown are sections
through the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Upper) and the
cerebellum (Lower), costained with an antibody against
CRMP2-p-T514 (yellow) and DAPI (blue). Regions in the red
boxes are magnified (Left) to visualize the pyramidal and Pur-
kinje cell layers, respectively. Other regions in which neurons
showed expression were cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and
striatum. (Scale bar: 250 μm, Right, and 100 μm, Left.) (B) LiCl
administration to mice increases levels of inactive (phosphory-
lated) GSK3β (red arrow) and lowers levels of inactive CRMP2-p-
T514 (red arrow) compared with water (H2O) (based on quan-
tification of Western blot analysis of hippocampal protein). (n =
7, H2O-treated; n = 7, LiCl-treated, *P = 0.05.) (C–F) Constitutive
Crmp2-KO mice have grossly normal bodies and brains but are
characterized at adulthood by defects in dendritic morphology
(compared with WT) in the regions where CRMP2 is expressed
[e.g., in CA1 of the hippocampus, as shown here in Golgi stains
examined along the stratum radiatum (33), but also seen in
striatum and cortex]. (C and D) CRMP2-KO mice show a fivefold
increase in bifurcation of apical dendrites proximally (creating
increased dendritic branching points at the expense of main
trunk dendrites). The representative pyramidal neurons in-
dicated by red arrows in C are each magnified in the respective
Insets below the overview and are quantified in D. (Scale bar,
100 μm.) (Data shown are mean ± SEM from 49 to 76 neurons
from three mice of each genotype; Student t test: *P <
0.001 compared with WT.) (E and F) The dendrites themselves
are characterized by a decreased density of spines (i.e., average
number of spines per micrometer). The red blocked areas in E
are magnified in the Insets and the data are quantified in F.
(Scale bar: 10 μm; 2.5 μm in Insets.) (Data shown are mean ± SEM
from >20 dendrites from each of three WT and three CRMP2-KO
mice; **P = 0.0006 compared with WT.) This diminished dendritic
spine density and length in the CRMP2-KO mouse is strikingly
similar to that seen in the primary human postmortem brain
specimens from LiR BPD patients (Fig. 4 A, C, and D) and would
be consistent with the functional consequences seen in LiR
BPD neurons (Fig. 5). (G) Differential localization of non-
phosphorylated and phosphorylated CRMP2, in and out of
spines, respectively. A representative field of neurons examined
in situ along the stratum radiatum in the rat hippocampus. Cyan
boxes (first row) indicate the dendritic regions magnified in the second row and stained, respectively, for filamentous actin (F-actin, white), the neuronal marker MAP2
(blue), CRMP2 (red), and CRMP2-p-T514 (green); these same regions, in their respective columns in the third row, are costained with combinations of the other markers and
the images merged. Arrowheads indicate phalloidin-stained dendritic spines; they contain nonphosphorylated CRMP2 (red) but do not stain for CRMP2-p-T514 (green).
Magnified images from the white boxed areas in the third row are magnified in the fourth row and again show that nonphosphorylated CRMP2 (red) is expressed
throughout the neuron, including the dendritic shaft, branches, and spines; CRMP2-p-T514 (green) is not expressed in the spines, suggesting that, when CRMP2 becomes
phosphorylated, it leaves or is excluded from the spines. In the fourth row, a white arrow points to the same representative dendritic spines in both Left and Right panels
nicely showing that, although nonphosphorylated CRMP2 fills the spines, phosphorylated CRMP2 is absent. (Scale bar: 90 μm, first row; 40 μm, second and third rows;
15 μm, fourth row.) (H–J) LiCl increases dendritic spine volume and density, an action abrogated by KO of CRMP2. Rat hippocampal neurons (MAP2+, green) show an
increase in F-actin staining (red) after 7 d of incubation with LiCl (3 mM) (H), presented quantitatively in I. (Scale bar: 15 μm, Top; 7 μm, Bottom.) F-actin area correlates with
dendritic spine volume (44, 45). LiCl induced a 60% increase in the area of F-actin puncta associated with dendritic spines and increased spine density by 36% [11 spines/
10 μm (untreated) vs. 15 spines/10 μm (LiCl)]. (Data expressed as mean ± SEM; ***P < 0.001 unpaired Student’s t test; n = 23 neurons per group; 3,255 actin spines
measured in control neurons, 3,812 spines in LiCl-treated neurons.) (J) In contrast, hippocampal neurons from the CRMP2-KO mouse evince no increase in spine density
from their baseline when similarly treated with LiCl, in contrast to WT littermates. (KO untreated, n = 13; KO+LiCl, n = 11; WT+LiCl, n = 9. One-way ANOVA, **P = 0.0013.)

 pathophysiologically to the lithium-response pathway. (See SI Appen-
dix, Figs. S9 and S12 for further discussion of this possibility based on
biochemical and functional data, respectively.) Although CRMP2 may
play a role in other neuropsychiatric diseases—for example, total
CRMP2 levels may be abnormal in postmortem brains of schizo-
phrenics—aberrantly elevated inactive:active CRMP2 ratios with ex-
cessively high CRMP2-p-T514 seems specific to LiR BPD.
The lithium-response pathway impinging on CRMP2 likely has
additional modes of input that go beyond those illustrated in Fig.
1B. For example, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) also
reduced CRMP2-p-T514 in a manner similar to lithium (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S13A), suggesting that systems downstream of tyrosine
receptor kinase B (TRKB, the BDNF receptor) might be in-
tegrated into the pathway (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B). Moreover,
CRMP2 has been associated with tauopathies via its interactions
with microtubule-associated protein tau and presenillin 1. Indeed,
CRMP2 interacts with amyloid precursor protein, and has been noted
to be a component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease
(41). Hence, not only might this axis be implicated in diseases other
than BPD (cytoskeletal dynamics coming to be recognized as central
to a growing number of neuropathological processes), but also drugs
that lower CRMP2-p-T514 may potentially be more widely thera-
peutic (particularly in disorders characterized by deposition of cyto-
skeletal elements such as tau either as a cause or a biomarker).
If our premise is correct that identifying a therapeutic pathway
also implicates that pathway as central to that disease’s patho-
genesis, then certain broader ideas warrant mentioning. First,
whereas BPD has heritable features and developmental under-
pinnings, it would appear to be a disorder not of a defective gene
per se but rather of dysregulated posttranslational modulation of a
normally produced gene product that, although developmentally
critical, plays a physiologic role in all individuals throughout life.
Second, attributing pathophysiology to aberrant cytoskeletal dy-
namics (dendritic disorganization representing one consequence)
would appear to implicate not merely defective neurons but also
dysregulated interneuronal networks. Whether these observations
are particular to LiR BPD or are applicable more widely to other
neuropsychiatric disorders warrants study.

Blocking phosphorylation of CRMP2 pro-
motes behavioral improvement in animal models of
LiR BPD. (A and B) Methamphetamine (“Meth”; 200 μM),
an accepted agent for experimentally-inducing LiR BPD-
like behavior (e.g., mania) in mice, increases CRMP2-
p-S522 and CRMP2-p-T514 levels (although not total
CRMP2) in mouse hippocampal neurons both (A) in vitro
[mean ± SEM; unpaired t test *P < 0.005, number of
fields: control (“ctrl”) = 41, Meth = 43] and (B) in vivo
(9-wk-old C57BL/6J mice, 60 min postinjection of 2 mg/kg
Meth i.p., relative to β-actin; compared with saline,
*P < 0.05, **P < 0.001; data expressed as means ±
SEM; n = 3 mice-per-condition). Striatum is pre-
sented here but all CRMP2-expressing regions yield
similar findings (Dunnett test). (C) In CRMP2ki/ki
mice, the S522 priming phospho-site is eliminated
preventing phosphorylation of T509, T514, and
S518. We postulate that T514 and S522 are lithium’s
site-of-action, suppressing CRMP2 phosphorylation;
the mutation mimics lithium’s posited action.
(D) Western blot confirming that Meth (2 mg/kg,
i.p.) increases (within 60 min) phosphorylation of
CRMP2 at S522 and T514 in WT but not CRMP2ki/ki
mouse brains. (Residual bands at S522 reflect minor
cross-reactivity of the antibody with CRMP1-p-S522.)
(E) Open-field test for quantifying nonmanic be-
havior (time spent exploring the unprotected cen-
ter) vs. manic behavior (little time in the center,
more time “manically” circling the periphery). (F–H)
Comparisons of CRMP2ki/ki and WT mouse behavior
after Meth administration confirms that the muta-
tion preventing CRMP2 phosphorylation (emulating
lithium’s posited site-of-action) decreases BPD-like
behaviors. (F) WT littermates (7- to 12-wk-old, n =
10) (○) injected with Meth (2 mg/kg, i.p.; green ar-
row) become “manic” and hyperlocomotor, spend-
ing less time in the center (red arrow), whereas the
nonphosphorylatable CRMP2ki/ki mice (n = 17) (△),
similarly treated with Meth, spend no less time in
the center, (i.e., no change from their untreated
baseline; means ± SEM), not displaying this BPD-like
behavior. (In order not to contaminate this assay of
anxiety/mania, the two vertical hash marks on the
x axis represent a 20- to 30-min recording gap to
allow the mice to reacclimate to the cage after
handling and receiving an injection and for Meth to
reach a steady-state brain level.) (G) Meth-treated
CRMP2ki/ki mice (“KI”, red dots) display less loco-
motor activity compared with Meth-treated WT lit-
termates (green dots) (means ± SEM by repeated measures ANOVA: †P < 0.05; by Bonferroni posttest: **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; n.s., not significant; WT+
Meth, n = 10; KI+Meth, n = 17; WT+saline, n = 7; KI+saline, n = 9). (H) Hyperlocomotor WT mice travel a greater distance following Meth administration
than Meth-treated but nonmanic CRMP2ki/ki mice (means ± SEM by Bonferroni, *P < 0.05; n as per G). In short, the nonphosphorylatable CRMP2ki/ki mouse
remains nonmanic and minimally affected by Meth as if on chronic lithium.

 With regard to disease modeling in general, this study suggests a
strategy for merging hiPSC technology with proteomics to discern
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in complex, polygenic,
multifactorial diseases in which causative genes, cells, proteins,
and pathways are not well-understood. If there exists an agent that is
known to be functionally impactful even if its molecular mechanism-
of-action is uncertain (like lithium in BPD), such an agent may allow
an investigator to probe otherwise inscrutable intracellular signaling by
identifying its target and then reconstructing the regulatory molecular
routes upstream and downstream of that node with an eye toward
mapping underlying pathogenic pathways and identifying more spe-
cific drug targets for the development of safer, cheaper, or more ef-
fective pharmacotherapeutics. In this way, hiPSCs may be used in the
most challenging diseases not only to reflect phenomenology and a
phenotype, but also to identify underlying molecular mechanisms.
Materials and Methods
Human fibroblasts or lymphoblasts from multiple well-sourced patients (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S1) were reprogrammed to hiPSCs via nonintegrating episomal-
mediated (42), lentivirus-mediated (1), or retrovirus-mediated (19) gene transfer,
characterized (43), and differentiated to NPCs and cortical interneurons, as per our
routine and as previously described (17–20). Protein isolation, 2D-DIGE and SILAC,
Western blotting, and coimmunoprecipitation were performed as described pre-
viously (17, 28). Immunofluorescence was quantified by pixel number captured via
image analysis software using unbiased stereology. All MS data are publicly ac-
cessible; for SILAC data, the mass spectra may be downloaded from MassIVE
(massive.ucsd.edu) using accession no. MSV000080975; the data are directly ac-
cessible via ftp://massive.ucsd.edu (MSV000080975). Creation and analysis of
CRMP2 knockout and knockin mice used standard transgenic techniques. Analysis
of primary cultures of rodent hippocampal neurons also followed standard tech-
niques (44). Cai
2+ transients and flux were measured via kinetic imaging analysis
(34, 35). Animal modeling of BPD behavior (to determine the response to lithium-
response pathway manipulation) was as described previously (37–39). All animal
use was conducted in accordance with the NIH guidelines and approved by the
Yokohama City University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Human
postmortem material was obtained from the University of Pittsburgh and from the
McLean Hospital. Patient samples were obtained following informed consent; all
patient identification was removed and the material was processed according to
IRB approvals including from Nova Scotia Health Authority Research Ethics Board,
National Institutes of Mental Health, and the Sanford-Burnham Prebys Medical
Discovery Institute. Dendrite and dendritic spine morphology were assessed as per
routine procedures with Golgi stains and image-assisted quantification (44, 45).
Bioinformatic analysis was performed as per the Sullivan Lab Evidence Project,
ProtKIN, and IPA. See SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods for details.
