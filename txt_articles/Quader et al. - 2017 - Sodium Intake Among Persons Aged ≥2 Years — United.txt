High sodium consumption can increase hypertension, a 
major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (1). Reducing 
sodium intake can lower blood pressure, and sodium reduc-
tion in the U.S. population of 40% over 10 years might save 
at least 280,000 lives (2). Average sodium intake in the United 
States remains in excess of Healthy People 2020 objectives,* and 
monitoring sources of sodium in the U.S. population can help 
focus sodium reduction measures (3,4). Data from 2013–2014 
What We Eat in America (WWEIA), the dietary intake 
portion of the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES),† were analyzed to determine the ranked 
percentage sodium contribution of selected food categories and 
sources of sodium intake from all reported foods and beverages, 
both overall and by demographic subgroups. These latest data 
include updated food codes and separate estimates for intake 
among non-Hispanic Asians.§ In 2013–2014, 70% of dietary 
sodium consumed by persons in the United States came from 
25 food categories; breads were the top contributor, accounting 
for 6% of sodium consumed. A majority of sodium consumed 
was from food obtained at stores; however, sodium density 
(mg/1,000 kcal) was highest in food obtained at restaurants. 
A variety of commonly consumed foods contributes to U.S. 
sodium intake, emphasizing the importance of sodium reduc-
tion across the food supply (4).
NHANES is a nationally representative sample of the U.S. 
noninstitutionalized population that uses a multistage prob-
ability sampling design, with oversampling of certain popula-
tion subgroups, including non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, 
and since 2011–12, non-Hispanic Asians. In 2013–2014, 
interviews and examinations were conducted among 9,813 
participants (68.5% overall response rate), 8,067 of whom were 
aged ≥2 years and had a complete and reliable 24-hour dietary 
recall. The dietary recall was conducted in the NHANES 
mobile examination center, and information on types and 
amounts of all foods and beverages consumed during the previ-
ous 24 hours were self-reported by the participant to a trained 
interviewer using U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) 
automated multiple-pass method.¶ Each reported food or 
beverage was assigned a food code from the USDA Food 
and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) with

corresponding nutrient content by weight.** Nutrient intake 
from each food for each person was estimated by multiplying the 
reported amount of food consumed by the nutrient intake per 
amount. The amount of salt added to food at the table was not 
collected; thus estimates of sodium intake exclude salt added at 
the table.†† Each of the 8,537 FNDDS food codes was assigned 
to one of 153 WWEIA food categories, grouped on the basis 
of consumption and nutrient content.§§ Similar categories were 
further combined into 109 categories for this analysis.
The top 25 food categories contributing to sodium consump-
tion were identified and ranked based on their contribution 
to sodium consumed from all reported foods and beverages, 
excluding salt added at the table (the sum of the amount of 
sodium consumed from all foods within a specific category, or 
source, for all persons, divided by the sum of the amount of 
sodium consumed from all foods for all persons, and multiplied 
by 100). Sodium density was used to account for differences 
in the amount of calories consumed. Analyses were conducted 
using statistical software that accounts for the complex survey 
design, and for all estimates, 1-day dietary sample weights 
were used.
The mean daily sodium intake from foods and beverages 
among the U.S. population aged ≥2 years was 3,409 mg, and 
the mean sodium density was 1,683 mg/1,000 kcal. Across 
age subgroups, sodium intake was highest among persons 
aged 20–50 years (Table 1). Men had significantly higher 
sodium intake than did women (T-tests, p<0.001) and non-
Hispanic Asians consumed a more sodium-dense diet and fewer 
calories compared with non-Hispanic whites (T-tests, p<0.05) 
(Table 2). Overall, 44% of sodium consumed came from 10 
food categories, with 70% from 25 food categories, ranging 
from 3.8% to 6.2% from the top five: breads (rank = 1), pizza 
(2), sandwiches (3), cold cuts and cured meats (4), and soups 
(5), to 1.3% from rice (25) (Table 1). For almost all popula-
tion subgroups, the top five food categories contributing to 
sodium intake were among the top 10 categories for the overall 
population aged ≥2 years. Exceptions to this were milk (fourth 
highest contributor to sodium intake among children aged 
2–5 years), meat mixed dishes (fifth highest contributor among

† A measure that accounts for differences in the amount of calories consumed from foods obtained from each source, defined as mg of sodium per 1,000 kcal.
§ Food source categories were analyzed from responses to the question, “Where did you get this (most of the ingredients for this) [food name]?” “Cafeteria at school” 
and “child care center” were combined in one category. Sources other than those shown were combined under “other” and included “from someone else/gift”
, and 
19 other sources (e.g., vending machine), including “missing,” “do not know,” and “other/specify”

children aged 2–19 years). The remaining sodium (9.8%) was 
consumed from other listed sources. Among the total popula-
tion and among children, food obtained from restaurants with 
waitstaff were the most sodium-dense, whereas among adults, 
food obtained from cafeterias/care centers were as sodium-
dense as those from restaurants (Table 3).
Discussion
This analysis found that approximately 70% of sodium 
consumed by the U.S. population aged ≥2 years came from 25 
food categories, with 44% from the top 10 categories alone, 
and provides the most current data on sources of U.S. sodium 
intake. These results are consistent with previous reports that 
found that store-bought and restaurant foods are the main con-
tributors to sodium in the diets of persons in the United States, 
emphasizing the importance of monitoring sodium content of 
these foods (5,6). Average U.S. daily sodium intake continues 
to exceed the Healthy People 2020 objective of 2,300 mg (3).
Since 2007–2008, a majority of the major food categories 
contributing to population sodium intake have not changed, 
with the exception of burritos and tacos, which were previously 
not ranked in the top 10, but were the sixth highest contribu-
tor in 2013–2014 (5). This might be attributable in part to an 
actual increase in consumption of these foods, but more likely 
represents a difference in collection and coding methodology 
that capture Mexican mixed dishes as a single food code.¶¶
In addition, rankings for some food categories differed 
among racial/ethnic groups. Among Hispanics, burritos and

tacos contributed 8.9% of sodium intake, compared with 
3.8% among the general population. Most notably, among 
non-Hispanic Asians, the top two sources of sodium were soups 
and rice, contributing much more dietary sodium than among 
other racial/ethnic groups. However, FNDDS food codes for 
rice include sodium from salt added in cooking; this might 
partially explain the high contribution to sodium, since rice 
without salt added is naturally low in sodium. Asian-Americans 
are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States; 
as a group, their diets and cardiovascular health and risk factors 
might differ from those of other racial/ethnic populations in 
the United States, although data on this subject are limited 
(7,8). The racial/ethnic differences in food types contributing 
to sodium intake suggest the importance of sodium reduction 
across the food supply, rather than in just a few categories, to 
reflect diversity in food choices.
While the majority of sodium was obtained from food pur-
chased at stores, 27% of sodium consumed came from food 
obtained at restaurants, and restaurant food contributed more 
sodium per calorie than did food obtained from stores, which 
supports the need to monitor and reduce sodium levels in food 
across these venues (4,5).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, dietary data are self-reported and therefore subject 
to recall bias and underreporting; however, USDA’s automated 
multiple-pass method is a valid measure of population level 
sodium intake (9). Second, the results of this analysis are not 
generalizable to institutionalized populations. Third, the rank-
ing of food categories by their contribution to sodium intake 
is influenced by methods of categorizing and defining specific

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Reducing sodium intake can reduce blood pressure; hyperten-
sion is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. According to data 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
2007–2008, average daily U.S. sodium intake was 3,266 mg, 
exceeding Healthy People 2020 objectives, and 44% of sodium 
consumed came from just 10 food types.
What is added by this report?
The most recent data, from 2013–2014, indicate that average 
daily U.S. sodium intake is 3,409 mg (excluding salt added at the 
table), with 44% of intake from 10 food types and 70% from 25 
food types, 61% from food obtained at stores, and highest 
sodium density (mg/1,000 kcal) from food obtained at restau-
rants. Food types contributing to intake differ by racial /ethnic 
group, with current data indicating that non-Hispanic Asians 
might consume a slightly more sodium-dense diet than that of 
non-Hispanic whites.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Sodium intake remains high and comes from a variety of food 
types and places. Monitoring differences in types and sources of 
intake can help focus sodium reduction measures to reduce 
blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.
foods. For example, sandwiches, when defined as both single-
code sandwiches and combinations of individual sandwich 
ingredients, contribute about one fifth of total sodium intake 
by U.S. adults (10). Fourth, the data are subject to errors in 
food coding and composition. Finally, estimates of sodium con-
sumption exclude sodium from salt added at the table, which 
accounts for an estimated 5%–6% of total sodium intake.
Monitoring population sodium intake and sources of sodium 
can inform measures to reduce sodium content of the food 
supply. Since publication of previous reports on sodium intake 
in the U.S. population, initiatives including CDC’s Sodium 
Reduction in Communities Program,*** New York City’s 
National Sodium Reduction Initiative,††† and the Healthy 
Hunger-Free Kids Act§§§ are aimed at reducing the sodium 
content of foods in specific venues and communities, including 
stores, restaurants and school cafeterias. In 2016, the Food and 
Drug Administration issued draft voluntary sodium targets 
to encourage food manufacturers and restaurants to gradu-
ally lower the sodium content of food products.¶¶¶ Persons

can compare Nutrition Facts labels when shopping, choose 
lower sodium options, and request nutrition information 
when dining out. The current data can serve as a baseline to 
monitor changes in the population’s sodium intake and food 
types contributing to sodium intake overall, and by subgroup 
to help target initiatives. The results of this study indicate that 
U.S. sodium intake continues to exceed Healthy People 2020 
targets and comes from a variety of foods and sources. Moderate 
sodium reduction in the food supply is a key recommended 
public health strategy to prevent cardiovascular disease (4).
