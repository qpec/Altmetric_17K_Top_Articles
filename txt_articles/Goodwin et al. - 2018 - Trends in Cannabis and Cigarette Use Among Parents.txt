BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated trends in cannabis use among parents with 
children at home in the United States and estimated changes in prevalence of any cannabis 
use and daily cannabis use among parents who identified as cigarette smokers and 
nonsmokers with children in the home from 2002 to 2015.
METHODS: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health is an annual, nationally representative, 
cross-sectional study conducted in the United States. Using logistic regression models, 
associations between cigarette smoking and any past-month and daily past-month 
cannabis use among parents with children in the home from 2002 to 2015 were estimated. 
Moderation of these associations by demographics and trends over time was examined.
RESULTS: Past-month cannabis use among parents with children in the home increased from 
4.9% in 2002 to 6.8% in 2015, whereas cigarette smoking declined from 27.6% to 20.2%. 
Cannabis use increased from 11.0% in 2002 to 17.4% in 2015 among cigarette-smoking 
parents and from 2.4% to 4.0% among non–cigarette-smoking parents (P value for trends 
<.0001). Cannabis use was nearly 4 times more common among cigarette smokers versus 
nonsmokers (17.4% vs 4.0%; adjusted odds ratio = 3.88 [3.16–4.75]), as was daily cannabis 
use (4.6% vs 0.8%; adjusted odds ratio = 3.70 [2.46–5.55]). The overall percentage of 
parents who used either cigarettes and/or cannabis decreased from 29.7% in 2002 to 
23.5% in 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to decrease secondhand smoke exposure via cigarette smoking cessation 
may be complicated by increases in cannabis use. Educating parents about secondhand 
cannabis smoke exposure should be integrated into public education programs on 
secondhand tobacco smoke exposure.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Tobacco control 
efforts have been successful in reducing the extent to 
which children are exposed to secondhand cigarette 
smoke in the home. Little is known about current trends 
in the use of cannabis among parents with children in 
the home.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Parental cannabis use is 
increasing in homes with children. Cannabis use is 
substantially higher among parents who use cigarettes. 
Exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke continues to 
decline, yet exposure to cannabis smoke among children 
appears to be an increasing concern.

 Exposure to the mixture of 
sidestream and exhaled mainstream 
smoke from cigarettes (secondhand 
tobacco smoke [STS]) is associated 
with a range of health risks in 
children.1 Residential parental 
smoking is the primary source of 
child STS exposure.2, 
 
3 The effects 
of child exposure to secondhand 
cannabis smoke (SCS) may be 
harmful as well.4, 
5 For example, 
laboratory studies of the chemical 
composition of mainstream and 
sidestream smoke from marijuana 
cigarettes confirm the presence 
of known carcinogens and other 
chemicals linked to respiratory 
disease.6 Detectable levels of 
marijuana metabolites have been 
found in children exposed to SCS, 
7, 
 
8  
and some toxic chemicals found 
in both SCS and STS have higher 
concentrations in SCS than in STS.9 
There are emerging data on adverse 
effects of child exposure to both 
tobacco and cannabis, but little 
is known about the prevalence of 
exposure to both and/or which 
populations might be at greatest risk.
Child exposure to residential STS 
has decreased over the past several 
decades with the declining smoking 
prevalence and increased awareness 
of the heightened vulnerability of 
children to STS risks.10, 
 
11 As tobacco 
use declines, 2 potentially relevant 
SHS-exposure trends are emerging. 
First, cannabis use in the overall US 
population is increasing.12, 
 
13 Second, 
this increase (especially in daily 
cannabis use) appears concentrated 
among cigarette smokers relative 
to nonsmokers.14 Thus, despite 
declining STS exposure rates, the 
degree to which these declines are 
occurring among children living with 
cigarette smoking parents remains 
unclear given the disproportionately 
high prevalence of cannabis use 
among cigarette smokers in general. 
Moreover, an overall population 
increase in cannabis use and child 
SCS exposure may thwart the public 
health gains achieved in reducing 
child exposure to STS. Relatedly, 
cigarette use and children’s STS 
exposure is disproportionately 
common in the most vulnerable 
demographic groups (eg, African 
American, low income, and 
those with lower levels of formal 
education).15 For instance, Homa 
et al11 showed in a review that 
bioverified STS exposure is highest 
among low-income individuals, 
African Americans, and children 
under age 11. Therefore, it is possible 
that trends in the co-occurring 
use of cigarettes and cannabis are 
concentrated in specific populations. 
Understanding these patterns and 
trends can facilitate the targeting 
of vulnerable populations and 
intervention resources.
To fill these gaps, we first examined 
the prevalence of current cigarette 
smoking and cannabis use among 
parents with children living in 
the same home in the United 
States. Second, we investigated 
the relationship between cigarette 
smoking and current cannabis 
use and current daily cannabis 
use among parents overall, and by 
demographic subgroups. Third, we 
estimated the annual prevalence 
of current cannabis use and daily 
cannabis use among current cigarette 
smoking and nonsmoking parents 
living in homes with children from 
2002 to 2015 and assessed trends 
over time.
METHODS
Data and Population
Data were drawn from the public-use 
data files from the National Survey 
on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) 
from the years 2002 to 2015. NSDUH 
provided annual cross-sectional 
national data on the use of tobacco, 
other substances, and mental health 
in the United States, as described 
elsewhere. The weighted overall 
response rates for NSDUH during 
these years ranged from 55.2% 
(2015) to 71.9% (2002). The median 
response rate was 65.9%. Analyses 
were restricted to adult respondents 
(aged ≥18 years) with children aged 
<18 years living in the home (N = 
173 082). Of these respondents, 2.2% 
were excluded because they could 
not be classified per our definitions 
of current smokers or current 
nonsmokers (see below), resulting  
in a total study population of  
N = 169 259.
Measures
Current Cigarette Smoking
Respondents were categorized as 
current cigarette smokers if they 
reported the following: (1) smoking 
all or part of a cigarette in the past 
30 days and (2) lifetime use of ≥100 
cigarettes. Otherwise, respondents 
were classified as nonsmokers. 
Respondents (n = 3573) who 
reported cigarette smoking in the 
past 30 days but <100 cigarettes used 
in their lifetime or who reported 
smoking in the past but were missing 
information on use of cigarettes 
in the past 30 days (n = 250) were 
excluded from analyses.
Current cigarette smokers were 
categorized as daily smokers if they 
reported using cigarettes 30 out of 
the past 30 days and as nondaily 
smokers otherwise.
Current Cannabis Use
Respondents were classified as 
current cannabis users if they 
reported using marijuana or hashish 
at least 1 out of the past 30 days; 
current daily users were defined as 
those who reported using cannabis 
on 30 of the past 30 days.
Covariates
The following demographic 
covariates were incorporated to 
address potential confounding 
and to explore moderation of the 
association between current smoking 
and current cannabis use among 
parents with children in the home: 
respondent sex, age, highest level 
of education, current marital status,

 current household income, and race. 
Categorical measures were used 
for each covariate as shown in the 
footnote to Table 1.
Statistical Analysis
The annual prevalence of current 
cigarette smoking and current and 
daily cannabis use among adult 
parents with children in the home 
was calculated for each year from 
2002 to 2015. Separate logistic 
regression models were fit for 
each by using a continuous term 
for calendar year to assess overall 
linear time trends in prevalence 
over the study period. Models 
were unadjusted and adjusted 
for demographic covariates. This 
adjustment was repeated for 
each combination of cigarette and 
cannabis use.
Logistic regression models were 
fit to determine if current cigarette 
smoking was associated with 
current or current daily cannabis 
use, unadjusted and adjusted 
for demographic covariates and 
calendar year (categorical). We 
used additional models to examine 
current cigarette smokers as daily 
versus nondaily. Moderation of the 
association between current cannabis 
use with current cigarette smoking 
was assessed by adding smoking ×  
demographic covariate product 
terms to the model. Stratum-specific 
adjusted risk differences (aRDs) for 
cannabis use in current smokers 
versus nonsmokers were calculated 
by using the average marginal 
predictions from logistic regression 
models. Comparisons between 
strata were performed by using the 
difference in difference P values.
The annual prevalence of current 
cigarette smoking, current cannabis 
use, and current daily cannabis use 
among adult parents with children 
in the home was calculated for each 
year from 2002 to 2015. Separate 
logistic regression models were fit 
for each by using a continuous term 
for calendar year to assess overall 
linear time trends in prevalence 
over the study period. Models 
were unadjusted and adjusted for 
demographic covariates. This process 
was repeated for each combination of 
cigarette smoking and cannabis use.
Finally, the annual prevalence of 
current any cannabis use and current 
daily cannabis use was calculated 
by current cigarette smoking status. 
Variation in time trends in cannabis 
use by cigarette smoking status 
was assessed by using logistic 
regression models with a continuous 
term for calendar year and year × 
smoking interaction, unadjusted and 
adjusted for covariates. The aRDs 
for cannabis use between 2002 and 
2015 were calculated by current 
smoking status by using the average 
marginal predictions from the logistic 
regression models.
All analyses were conducted by using 
SAS-callable SUDAAN version 11.0.1 
(RTI International, Research Triangle 
Park, NC) and incorporated survey 
weights to account for the NSDUH 
complex sampling design. All results, 
other than raw counts, were adjusted 
for sampling weights.
RESULTS
Prevalence of Current Cigarette Use, 
Cannabis Use, and Daily Cannabis 
Use Over Time
From 2002 to 2015, there was a 
significant decreasing trend in the 
prevalence of current smoking from 
27.6% in 2002 to 20.2% in 2015  
(P < .0001; see Fig 1). In contrast, there 
were significant increasing trends in 
the prevalence of current cannabis 
use from 4.9% to 6.8% (P < .0001) 
and daily cannabis use from 0.7% 
to 1.6% (P < .0001). Overall, there 
was a decrease in the prevalence of 
either cigarette or cannabis use in 
homes with children from 29.7% in 
2002 to 23.5% in 2015. All trends 
were statistically significant when 
unadjusted and when adjusted for 
demographic covariates.
Association Between Cannabis Use 
and Cigarette Smoking Status
Current Cannabis Use
In 2015, the adjusted odds ratio 
(aOR) for current cannabis use 
among current cigarette smokers 
versus nonsmokers was 3.88 
(3.16–4.75). The corresponding 
aORs for current cannabis use 
among daily cigarette smokers and 
nondaily cigarette smokers versus 
nonsmokers were 3.99 (3.19–5.00) 
and 3.69 (2.90–4.70) (see Table 1). 
Consistent patterns were observed in 
the data from all years combined (see 
Supplemental Table 4).

 Daily Cannabis Use
In 2015, the aOR for daily cannabis 
use in current smokers versus 
nonsmokers was 3.70 (2.46–5.55). 
Daily cannabis use was more common 
among nondaily (aOR = 2.68 [1.63–
4.40]) and daily (aOR = 4.28 [2.71–
6.76]) cigarette smokers relative 
to nonsmokers (Table 1). Similar 
associations were observed when 
data from all years were combined 
(see Supplemental Table 4).
The Prevalence of Cannabis Use 
and Association With Cigarette 
Smoking, Stratified by Demographic 
Characteristics
Between the years 2002 and 2015 
combined, current cannabis use 
was significantly more common 
among cigarette smokers compared 
with nonsmokers with a child in 
the home (13.1% vs 2.6%, aRD = 
7.9%; see Table 2). The stratum-
specific aRD of current cannabis use 
between current cigarette smokers 
versus nonsmokers was statistically 
significant at the P < .0001  
level within each demographic 
group.
The risk differences for current 
cannabis use associated with current 
cigarette smoking varied significantly 
across strata defined by sex, age, 
marital status, education, and race.
The increased current prevalence 
of cannabis use associated with 
smoking was greater among men 
(aRD = 10.2%) than women (aRD = 
6.3%) and among the younger  
people with children in the home 
(aRD = 11.2%, 18–25-year-olds) 
compared with those 50 and older 
(aRD = 3.8%). In terms of education, 
the largest difference in risk for 
current cannabis use between 
current smokers and nonsmokers 
occurred among college graduates 
(aRD = 9.4%). In terms of race, the 
increase in risk of current cannabis 
use in current smokers versus 
nonsmokers was highest among 
African American respondents  
(aRD = 10.4%). Although the 
relationship between current 
cannabis use and smoking was 
significant at each income stratum, 
the magnitude of the difference was 
similar for all levels of income.
Time Trends in the Prevalence of 
Current Cannabis Use and Daily 
Cannabis Use Among Adult Parents 
With Children Aged <18 in the Home, 
by Current Cigarette Smoking Status
In 2015, nearly 1 in 5 current 
cigarette smokers used cannabis 
in the past month (17.4%, up 
from 11.0% in 2002; see Table 
3). Meanwhile, 4.0% of current 
nonsmokers used cannabis in the 
past month in 2015 versus 2.4% in 
2002. Tests for trend revealed that 
the prevalence of current cannabis 
use increased both among current 
cigarette smokers (aOR = 1.04  
[1.03–1.05]) and nonsmokers (aOR =  
1.05 [1.04–1.07]) with children in 
the home from 2002 to 2015; there 
was no difference in the rate of this 
increase between the groups (P = 
.21). However, the aRD for current 
cannabis use in 2015 vs 2002 was 
higher among current smokers 
(aRD = 4.9%) than among current 
nonsmokers (aRD = 1.8%; P value for 
difference in differences < .0001).
The prevalence of daily cannabis 
use was higher in 2015 than in 2002 
among current cigarette smokers 
(4.6% vs 1.7%) and among current 
nonsmokers (0.76% vs 0.28%; see 
 
Table 3). Tests for trend revealed 
that these increases were significant 
and did not differ by smoking status 
(see Table 3). However, the aRD 
for daily use in 2015 vs 2002 was 
higher among current smokers 
(aRD = 1.9%) than among current 
nonsmokers (aRD = 0.6%; P value 
for difference in differences < .0001). 
From 2002 to 2015, the percentage 
of parents with children under age 
18 in the home who used neither 
cigarettes nor cannabis in the past 
month increased. The prevalence of 
smoking only decreased, whereas 
the prevalence of cannabis use alone 
or in combination with cigarette 
smoking increased (see Fig 2).

 DISCUSSION
Recent data suggest that children’s 
exposure to SCS carries health 
risks similar to, or worse than, 
exposure to STS.6 There is scant 
research on the effects of exposure 
to both cannabis and tobacco on 
children’s health and development. 
However, recent studies suggest 
that children exposed to both SCS 
and STS may be at heightened 
risk for cognitive and emotional 
problems.16, 
 
17 To understand the 
prevalence of joint exposure to 
SCS and STS, we estimated changes 
in the prevalence of cannabis use 
among current cigarette smokers 
and nonsmokers living in homes 
with children from 2002 to 2015, 
investigated the relationship 
between cigarette smoking and 
cannabis use among adults  
living in homes with children 
aged <18 in the United States, and 
identified high-risk groups. The 
results of this study support the 
public health gains in reducing 
overall child STS but raise other 
public health concerns about  
child exposure to SCS and 
especially high risk for combined 
exposures to SCS and STS in certain 
subpopulations.
Despite the declining prevalence 
of cigarette smoking in households 
with children over this period, 
an estimated 15.2 to 25.0 million 
children were living with a parent 
who was a current cigarette smoker 
in 2015.18 Moreover, cannabis use 
increased among parents with 
children in the home from 2002 to 
2015. This occurred among both 
cigarette smokers and nonsmokers. 
Although the net effect shows an 
overall decline in use of either 
cigarettes or cannabis in homes 
with children from 29.7% in 2002 
to 23.5% in 2015, there was an 
increase in the percent of homes 
with both. Therefore, the increase 
in cannabis use appears to be 
compromising progress of tobacco 
control, especially for vulnerable 
groups. An estimated 5.3 to 8.0 
million children in the United States 
were living with a parent who was 
a current cannabis user in 2015. In 
addition, the prevalence of cannabis 
use is nearly 4 times as high among 
cigarette smokers and is increasing 
rapidly in this group, suggesting 
that the potential for dual STS-SCS 
exposure may be even greater now 
than in the past due to children living 
with cigarette smokers.
Our findings that both any current 
cannabis use and daily cannabis 
use are more common among 
tobacco smokers compared with 
nonsmokers are consistent with 
previous studies.19 
– 
21 This is a 
concern for 2 reasons. First, there is 
the potential for synergistic and/or 
at least additive effects of exposure to 
common toxins found in both tobacco 
and cannabis smoke, increasing risks 
associated with child exposure in the 
home. Second, the combination of 
unique toxins between tobacco and 
cannabis smoke exposure increases 
the number of potential risks and 
consequences for exposed children. 
Although there is still room for 
improving STS reduction efforts 
in homes, public health campaigns 
have had notable success in reducing

from exposure to STS.23 
– 
25 Our 
results reveal a potential need to 
translate these efforts to address 
child exposure to SCS in the home. 
To the extent that cannabis use is an 
obstacle to smoking cessation, 
26, 
 
27 
going forward, protecting children 
from any type of secondhand smoke 
exposure may require assessment of 
both tobacco and cannabis smoking 
among parents and more intensive 
and innovative approaches to 
smoking cessation for those parents.
Several demographic differences 
were identified in the relationship 
between cannabis use and cigarette 
smoking among parents. The 
prevalence of cannabis use was 
highest among young parents who 
smoke cigarettes, with 1 in 5 ages 
18 to 25 using cannabis versus 7% 
of those over 50, and relative to only 
1 in 20 parents ages 18 to 25 who 
were non–cigarette smokers having 
used cannabis. This suggests that 
young children may be at particularly 
high risk for exposure because they 
spend more time in the home and 
in closer proximity to a parent than 
older children and teenagers who 
may be at school, out with friends, 
or working for much of the day. 
Cannabis use was most common in 
the lowest income group for both 
cigarette smokers and nonsmokers. 
This finding highlights another 
public health priority to address this 
disparity: ensuring that vulnerable 
groups have access and exposure to 
education and treatment designed to 
protect children from exposure.
We are unable with the current data 
to address completely the degree 
to which use among parents affects 
children’s exposure in the home for 
at least 2 reasons: (1) we do not have 
information on location of smoking, 
whether it occurs in the house and/
or in the proximity of children; (2)

Downloaded from 
 we do not have information about 
the quantity of smoke (1 cannabis 
cigarette per day versus 2 packs 
of cigarettes), which is relevant 
because even daily cannabis use is 
likely to produce a different quantity 
than cigarettes. Unlike cigarettes, 
it remains illegal in most places to 
smoke cannabis outdoors and in 
a range of public areas. Therefore, 
there is reason to believe that 
cannabis use is even more likely to 
occur in the home than cigarette 
smoking given their differences in 
legal status. In addition, although 
we did not have information about 
the methods of cannabis use among 
parents, which would affect the 
level of possible SCS exposure, 
recent evidence indicates the vast 
majority of cannabis use occurs 
via smoking, whereas edible forms 
account for <10% of use among US 
adults.28, 
 
29 Future researchers need 
to obtain specific estimates of the 
degree to which level of exposure 
is changing among children in the 
home. Researchers using biomarkers 
of cannabis and tobacco exposure 
in children of different ages and in 
households implementing varying 
degrees of protection (eg, household 
smoking bans) are needed to advance 
the field.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite the decline in cigarette use 
among parents with children in the 
home in the United States, we suggest 
that cannabis use is increasing among 
parents with children aged <18 years 
in the home, particularly among 
parents who also smoke cigarettes. 
Public health efforts that have shown 
success in decreasing exposure to 
STS in the home may be complicated 
by increased use of other smoked 
products, such as cannabis. Parents 
may benefit from education about 
protecting children from marijuana 
products, paraphernalia, waste, and 
smoke.
