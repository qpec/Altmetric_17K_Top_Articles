The article presents the results of the prospective study of 266 patients with dirofilariasis who received medical
and diagnostic assistance in Rostov Scientific Research Institute of Microbiology and Parasitology in Rostov-on-
Don, Russia from 2000 to 2016. We have assessed the features of the dynamics of epidemiology of this infection
in several territories of the Russian Federation, depending on the social structure of patients. Immature females
of dirofilaria were found most commonly in humans (82.9 ± 2.6%), the proportion of maturity females and
adult males of worms respectively was 10.5 ± 2.1% and 0.9 ± 0.6%. All mature worms were localized inside a
capsule. Peripheral blood eosinophilia was detected only in patients with the migration of helminths (19 of 116
persons – 16.4%). Blood samples of patients examined by the method of concentration in 3% acetic acid for
detection of microfilariae, showed negative result in all patients.
Our data are consistent with the opinion of KI Skriabin about that human as «dual facultative host» for
dirofiliaria. It is rare that parasite in human body is able to develop to the imago stage (according to our
observations – 11.4%). The immune response to invasion by dirofiliaria in human is manifested as dense con-
nective tissue which forms a capsule. According to our study the rare cases (22) of detection the sexual mature D.
repens (10.4%) were localized inside the capsule. Observations of patients with D. repens infection allowed
concluding that human for this helminth is «a biological deadend».
Introduction
For the past several years problem of human infection caused by
Dirofilaria spp. has attracted great attention of researchers. Several au-
thors have discussed the obligate and facultative relationships between
human and the dirofilariasis pathogen Dirofilaria (Nochtiella) repens
infection [1], as well as the role of the human as a potential source of
this roundworm infection in nature [1,2]. This hypothesis is based on
the cases of detection of larvae, adult, and gravid females of D. repens in
subcutaneous nodes [3]. Russian literature described the case where D.
repens larvae detected in human peripheral blood [2,4]. There are a few
reports about autochthonous pleuropulmonary dirofilariasis caused by
D. repens in Russia [4].
In the 1920s, KI Skriabin systematized some cases, which were
described by both foreign and Russian researchers, and came to the
conclusion that the cause of infection was the nematode – Dirofilaria
repens Railliet et Henry, 1911 [5]. In 1930, KI Skriabin, AJ Altgauzen
and ES.Shulman described the case of detection of mature males of D.
repens in the subcutaneous node on the right lower eyelid [6]. As
suggested by KI Skriabin, humans are a «double facultative host» for
dirofilariasis due to quantitative restrictions cases of invasion, and
failure for parasite to reach the sexual maturity in human. Because of
the immune response, human organism forms dense connective tissue
capsule, which prevents the completion of ontogenesis of dirofilaria
[7].
Until 2014 human dirofilariasis in the Russian Federation was
considered as a rare helminthiasis. But now, due to the sudden increase
of infectious cases, the human dirofiliriasis is recording separately from
other Helminthiasis in the official statistical reports. According to in-
formation
by
the
Center
of
Hygiene
and
Epidemiology
of
Rospotrebnadzor, at the end of 2012, 1093 cases infected by D. repens
have been recorded in Russian Federation. The largest number of cases
was revealed in the Rostov, Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod regions.
At the beginning of 2013, 242 patients with dirofilariasis were recorded
in the Rostov region. This is 22.1% of all cases recorded in the Russian
Federation.
The purpose of this work is to describe and analyse the clinical and
laboratory features of human infection of D. repens in the Rostov,

MARK
 Volgograd, Novgorod, Krasnodar regions during the period from 2000
to 2016.
Materials and methods
We observed 266 patients with dirofilariasis aged from 2 to 79 years
who received medical and diagnostic assistance in Rostov Scientific
Research Institute of Microbiology and Parasitology in Rostov-on-Don
from 2000 to 2016.
The diagnosis of dirofilariasis in humans was based on the micro-
scopy of removed parasites or their fragments, morphological and his-
topathological features, histological analysis of tissue sections of pa-
tients as well as objective data (photo, video) or visualization of moving
threadlike parasite beneath skin of patients.
To identify microfilariae in blood of the patients, the samples as-
sayed by concentration method with 3% acetic acid [8]. Serum of blood
examined by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) to detect Dirofilaria-spe-
cific antibodies [9]. We studied morphological and histological ex-
amination of the biological material: 211 nematode D. repens were
studied directly, 31 histologically and 24 were not available for vi-
sualization. Sexual maturity determined by the presence of helminthic
eggs in the uterus and according to the maturation of male reproductive
apparatus [10].
Results
Epidemiologically, all patients denied travel into areas of pre-
valence of anthroponotic filariasis, not leaving the territory of their
residence for 2 years or more. Of the 266 patients with dirofilariosis the
proportion of patients of active working age (20–49 years) was 59.0%
(Fig. 1). The study included 24 children, among them there were 2
infants (under 3 years old). Women significantly dominated in gender
structure (72.5%). The infection was more common among the urban
population. However, since 2008, we observed an increase of incidence
of dirofilariasis in rural areas. From 2000 to 2007 the proportion of
rural residents with D. repens was 8.9 ± 1.75%, and since 2008 to
2016 this number has increased more than 3 times – to 31.2 ± 2.84%
(p < 0,05).
Patients sought medical assistance due to the detection of fixed
cutaneous nodules up to 1.5 cm, or in cases of the visualization of
thread like moving worms under the skin in various localization. The
proportion of patients with encapsulated parasites was 56.4% (Fig. 2);
active migration of the parasite was observed in 43.6% of patients
(Fig. 3). In 17.7% cases worms moved considerable distances: from the
knee to the groin area; lower back, upper eyelid or from periorbital
region to shin and buttocks. Common localizations of Dirofilaria were
head and neck (most often in the periorbital area, and conjunctivitis
(face, scalp and forehead), or more rarely in the area of the trunk and
extremities). In 6 patients (2.3%), worms were found in the external
genitals. More than 1 nematodes was observed in three cases: in the first
case – immature male and female, in the second – two immature fe-
males, in the third – two mature females.
In 2005 only one patient was complaining on the floating object in
the right eye view, which was changing the form permanently, some-
times becoming like a slowly squirming worm. At the ophthalmology
examination in the vitreous body a threadlike worm was discovered
(Fig. 4) [11]. Due to the high risk of total damage of eye, surgical
treatment was not performed, therefore, determination the species of
dirofilaria was not possible. According to our data it was the only case
of detection of nematode inside the organ.
Peripheral blood eosinophilia was detected only in patients with the
migration of helminthes (19 of 116 – 16.4%). Biochemical tests of liver
and pancreas function in the most of patients were within the limits of
age norm or were abnormal due to their premorbid conditions such as
chronic cholecystitis, pancreatitis and diabetes, etc.
Blood samples of patients examined by the method of concentration
in 3% acetic acid to detect microfilariae, showed negative results in all
patients. Morphological examination of 211 removed parasites showed
that length of the extracted roundworms varied from 75 to 170 mm, the
most frequent nematode length was 110–120 mm (57.0%). The pro-
portion of immature females was 82.9 ± 2.6% and significantly pre-
vailed over the share of mature females (10.5 ± 2.1%), immature
males (5.7 ± 1.6%), adult males (0.9 ± 0.6%) (Fig. 5).
Due to the active migration of parasites, and the impossibility of

 surgical treatment conservative treatment of 24 adult patients was
conducted. Albendazole therapy was performed 800 mg/day and dox-
ycycline 200 mg/day in 2 divided doses with intervals of 12 h for
5 days. Due to individual intolerance of doxycycline 2 patients were
treated only with albendazole. In these patients, treatment failure was
observed: after 10–12 days dirofilarias reappeared under the skin and
were surgically removed.
Discussion
Dirofilariasis is the only vector-borne worm infection in countries
with a temperate climate. The definitive hosts of D. repens are animals
of the families Canidae, Felidae and Viverridae. The intermediate hosts
are mosquitoes of the family Culicidae. People become infected when
bitten by mosquitoes that contain third-stage filariform larvae of dir-
ofilariae The territory of south Russia is an area of high risk of trans-
mission of dirofiliariasis due to the suitable climatic conditions and
high prevalence of worm in definitive and intermediate hosts [8]. The
result is a significant number of cases of human invasion. The incidence
of human infestation correlated with the extent of infestation of the
definitive hosts [12,13]. In recent decades, in the most part of the cities,
diagnosis, prevention and treatment of dirofilariasis in definitive hosts
(pet dogs) were optimized so that treatment could be given whereas in
the rural areas their prevalence remains high [14]. This circumstance
explains the significant increase in cases of human dirofilariasis in the
rural area.
All cases of subcutaneous dirofilariasis were autochthonous.
The data of our observations are consistent with the opinion of KI
Scriabin that the human is a «dual facultative host» for dirofiliaria [7].
It is extremely rare that parasite in human body is able to develop to the
imago stage (according to our observations – 11.4%, according to the
observations of KI Scriabin – 1 case). The immune response to invasion
of the human organism by dirofiliaria manifested as dense connective
tissue which forming a capsule where the parasite is unable to fully
exercise its biological cycle [15]. According to our study the rare cases
(22) of detection, the sexual mature of D. repens (10.4%) were localized
inside the capsule, which is also consistent with the observations of KI

 Skriabin.
According to foreign researchers, pleuropulmonary and intraorganic
damage in humans were reported only in cases of the infection with D.
immitis [16,17]. During our observation only 1 case with the parasite
inside the vitreous humor was registered, but due to the threat of ser-
ious complications the surgery was not performed, so the species of the
helminth was not estimated. Results of epidemiological monitoring in
the Rostov region indicate that from 2011, the extent of infestation of
definitive hosts with D. immitis is beginning to prevail over D. repens
[12]. Perhaps in the future cases of human infestation by D. immitis will
be registered in this area.
According to some scientists, human dirofilariasis is not a serious
disease and has value mainly in the aspect of the differential diagnosis
of tumors [16,17].
Rare cases of complications after subcutaneous dirofilariasis were
associated with surgery [9] and the formation of allergic reactions [18].
Our observations of patients with D. repens infection correspond to a
row of European scientists from Slovakia [19], Czech Republic [20],
Greece [21], Italy [13], Austria [22], and others who came to conclu-
sion that the human is a biological deadend for this helminth.
Conclusion
For completion of biological cycle of Dirofilaria newborn larvae
must circulate in human blood for two weeks to become infectious, then
actively migrate to the lung capillaries. Under the favorable conditions
for the start of the circulation phase, larvae must appear in the per-
ipheral blood and become accessible for the vector of transmission. The
only case of the detection of microfilariae in the peripheral human
blood was observed in 2012 [2,4], but this patient returned after a
travel in South East Asia which is endemic for anthroponotic filariasis.
In our study, the hypothesis about the obligate relationship between
human and pleuropulmonary dirofilariasis, caused by D. repens [1,4] in
the Russian Federation today cannot be considered proven.
