Purpose
Cigarette smoking increases overall mortality, but it is not established whether smoking is asso-
ciated with breast cancer prognosis.
Methods
We evaluated the association between smoking status before and after breast cancer diagnosis and
mortality in the Collaborative Breast Cancer and Women’s Longevity Study, a population-based
prospective observational study conducted in Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.
Participants included 20,691 women, ages 20 to 79 years, diagnosed with incident localized or
regional invasive breast cancer between 1988 and 2008; a subset of 4,562 of these women were
recontacted a median of 6 years after diagnosis. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated
according to smoking status for death as a result of breast cancer; cancers of the lung, pharynx, or
intrathoracic organs; other cancer; respiratory disease; and cardiovascular disease.
Results
During a median of 12 years, 6,778 women died, including 2,894 who died as a result of breast cancer.
Active smokers 1 year before breast cancer diagnosis were more likely than never smokers to die of
breast cancer (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.37), respiratory cancer (HR, 14.48; 95% CI, 9.89 to 21.21),
other respiratory disease (HR, 6.02; 95% CI, 4.55 to 7.97), and cardiovascular disease (HR, 2.08; 95% CI,
1.80 to 2.41). The 10% of women who continued to smoke after diagnosis were more likely than never
smokers to die of breast cancer (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.60). When compared with women who
continued to smoke after diagnosis, those who quit smoking after diagnosis had lower mortality from
breast cancer (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.19) and respiratory cancer (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.95).
Conclusion
Smoking before or after diagnosis was associated with a higher mortality from breast cancer and
several other causes.

INTRODUCTION
Cigarette smoking is responsible for nearly half of
a million premature deaths in the United States
annually,1 and it continues to be one of the most
important public health issues today.2,3 Smoking
affects hormone concentrations,4 and a number
of studies have observed that the association
between smoking and the risk of developing
breast cancer may depend on the years of
smoking, the lifetime amount of smoking, and
the age at initiation.5-10 The 2014 Report of the
Surgeon General on the health consequences of
smoking concluded that there is sufficient
evidence of biologic mechanisms by which
breast cancer may be caused by smoking and
suggestive, but not sufficient, evidence to infer a
causal relationship.11
There are more than 3 million breast cancer
survivors in the United States,12 but only recently
has adequate follow-up accrued in large cohorts
to assess whether lifetime smoking is associated
with long-term prognosis. Several studies have
linked prediagnosis smoking history to higher
risk of death as a result of breast cancer,13-23 but
very little is known about women who continue to
smoke after diagnosis. To investigate cigarette
smoking habits of breast cancer cases and mor-
tality from breast cancer and other common

 smoking-related causes of death, we analyzed data from the
population-based Collaborative Breast Cancer Study (CBCS) and
Collaborative Women’s Longevity Study (CWLS).24,25 The CBCS
enrolled more than 22,000 women diagnosed with incident
invasive breast cancer through a series of case-control studies, and
the CWLS recontacted nearly 5,000 breast cancer survivors from
the CBCS to assess postdiagnosis exposures and health events.
METHODS
CBCS
The CBCS consisted of multisite population-based case-control
studies in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin, which were
conducted over a 20-year period beginning in 1988. The study enrolled
women with incident invasive breast cancer diagnosed from age 20 to
74 years from 1988 to 1991, to age 79 years from 1992 to 1996, and to age
69 years from 1997 to 2008. In total, 23,344 women with breast cancer
participated. All women completed a telephone interview, including a
questionnaire to assess prediagnosis exposures and health histories. For
recent exposures, participants were instructed to focus on those that
occurred approximately 1 year before breast cancer diagnosis. The median
time between diagnosis and completion of the CBCS questionnaire was
approximately 16 months (interquartile range, 12 to 19 months). Addi-
tional details, including full eligibility criteria, data collection procedures,
and participation rates, have been previously reported.24,25 The CBCS
protocols were approved by the institutional review boards of the medical
centers at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the University of
Wisconsin.
CWLS
Between 1998 and 2001, a total of 14,621 women with breast cancer
from the CBCS known to still be alive were identified and invited to
participate in the CWLS. Approximately 40% participated by completing a
mailed questionnaire that focused on postdiagnosis exposures and health
events. The median time between diagnosis and completion of the CWLS
questionnaire was approximately 6 years (interquartile range, 3 to 9 years).
Additional information on the design of the CWLS and the characteristics
of participants also has been previously reported.26-29 The CWLS protocols
were approved at the same institutional review boards as the CBCS.
Ascertainment and Definition of Cigarette Smoking History
Women enrolled in the CBCS were asked to report whether they had
smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime; their age at smoking
initiation; the total years of smoking; the average number of cigarettes
smoked per day; whether they continued to smoke 1 year before diagnosis
(ie, recent smokers); and, for those who quit (ie, former smokers), their age
at cessation. Pack-years were calculated for prediagnosis smokers by
multiplying the average number of cigarettes smoked per day by the
number of years smoked and dividing by 20 cigarettes per pack. Women in
the CWLS were asked to report whether they were currently smoking
cigarettes at the time of the questionnaire (ie, current smokers).
Ascertainment and Definition of Other Exposure Data
The CBCS interview collected information on demographics, height
and weight, reproductive history (including parity, age at first birth, and
menopausal status), use of medications (including exogenous hormones),
alcohol consumption, mammography history, and first-degree family
history of breast cancer. Menopause was defined as natural menopause,
hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, reaching age 55 years without
bilateral oophorectomy, or hormone therapy use without bilateral
oophorectomy. An alcoholic drink was defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5
ounces of red or white wine, or 1.5 ounces of spirits.30 In addition to
smoking history, the CWLS participants reported their height, weight, and
alcohol consumption habits after diagnosis, as of the time of questionnaire
completion.
Ascertainment and Definition of Tumor Characteristics and
Mortality Data
Date of breast cancer diagnosis, stage of disease at diagnosis, and
tumor histology were ascertained from state cancer registries according to
summarization guidelines from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results program.31 Vital status and cause of death were determined for all
women in the CBCS, including those who later enrolled in the CWLS, by
linkage to the National Death Index from the National Center for Health
Statistics.32 Identification of deaths was complete through December 31,
2009.
Underlying causes of death were classified into five broad groups
according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), ninth
revision33 (before 1999) or tenth revision34 (1999 and after): breast cancer;
respiratory cancer, including neoplasms of the nasopharynx, larynx,
trachea, bronchus, lung, pleura, and intrathoracic organs; other cancer;
noncancer respiratory disease, including acute upper and lower respiratory
infections and syndromes, influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, emphysema,
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory
disorders; and cardiovascular disease, including rheumatic heart disease,
hypertensive heart disease, ischemic heart disease, pulmonary heart disease,
cerebrovascular disease, arterial and/or vascular diseases, embolism, throm-
bosis, and other disorders of the circulatory system. ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes
for these five groups are summarized in Appendix Table A1 (online only).
Statistical Analyses
Of the 23,344 CBCS participants, we excluded 188 women who were
missing data on prediagnostic smoking status, 215 women for whom
prediagnostic pack-years could not be calculated, 475 women diagnosed
with distant-stage disease at diagnosis, 1,753 who had an unknown stage at
diagnosis, and 22 women who were missing vital status. In total, 20,691
women with localized or regional-stage breast cancer were included in
analyses of smoking before diagnosis.
For prediagnosis smoking considerations, survival time was calcu-
lated from the date of breast cancer diagnosis to the date of death or the end
of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression with staggered entry was
used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs. Models
stratified the baseline hazard on age at diagnosis, study phase, state of
residence, and stage, and they adjusted for several potential confounding
variables selected a priori, including education, body mass index, parous
status, age at first birth, menopausal status, use of postmenopausal hor-
mone therapy, mammography history, alcohol consumption, and first-
degree family history of breast cancer. All adjustment variables were
measured from the CBCS questionnaire and were intended to reflect
exposures approximately 1 year before breast cancer diagnosis. A separate
model was used for each cause of death.
Of 5,784 CWLS participants, a total of 5,168 were available for
analyses after the exclusions we imposed on women in the CBCS.
Additionally, we excluded 552 women who reported a breast cancer
recurrence that occurred between the CBCS and CWLS questionnaires,
and we excluded 45 women who indicated that they were in poor health at
the time of the CWLS questionnaire. Nine women reported smoking after
diagnosis who did not indicate smoking before diagnosis. Although
smoking initiation after diagnosis was possible, misclassification is also a
likely explanation, so we excluded these nine women. In total, 4,562
women with localized or regional-stage breast cancer at baseline were
included in analyses of smoking after diagnosis.
For postdiagnosis smoking considerations, survival time was cal-
culated from the date of return of the CWLS questionnaire to the date of
death or the end of follow-up. Smoking status was parameterized to
account for each possible pair of before/after diagnosis types (never/never,
former/former, recent/former, recent/current). Proportional hazards

 regression models for postdiagnosis smoking included the same covariates
as models for prediagnostic smoking and included postdiagnosis body
mass index, postdiagnosis alcohol consumption, and the number of years
between date of diagnosis and return of the CWLS questionnaire. The
assumption of proportion hazards was examined by testing for the stat-
istical significance of interactions with log-transformed survival time.
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
P values were two sided, and P #.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Prediagnosis Cigarette Smoking and Mortality
Nearly all participants were white, and the mean age at
diagnosis was 58 years (standard deviation, 11 years). Half of the
women had ever smoked, and 20% reported actively smoking 1
year before breast cancer diagnosis. These recent smokers were
generally younger, less educated, leaner, more likely to be heavy
drinkers ($ 10 drinks per week), and less likely to have undergone
mammography screening than former or never smokers (Table 1).
Compared with never smokers, those who quit before being
diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to have been
postmenopausal, used hormone therapy, consumed alcohol, and
undergone mammography. Never, former, and recent smokers had
nearly identical distributions of localized and regional-stage disease
at diagnosis.
A total of 6,778 deaths occurred over a median follow-up of
12 years. The two leading causes of death were breast cancer (2,894
deaths) and cardiovascular disease (1,394 deaths). Of 1,123 deaths
as a result of cancers other than breast, 294 deaths were results of
malignancies of the pharynx, lung, or intrathoracic organs. Pre-
diagnostic recent smokers, but not former smokers, were more
likely than never smokers to die of breast cancer (Table 2). The
highest relative risks of death as a result of breast cancer were
observed among long-term smokers ($ 30 years), high–pack-year
smokers ($ 30 pack years), and former smokers having quit fewer
than 5 years before breast cancer diagnosis (Table 3). Both former
and recent smokers had higher mortality from noncancer respi-
ratory diseases (367 deaths total) and cardiovascular diseases
(Appendix Table A2). HR estimates were substantially higher for
those who reported increasing duration of smoking and number of
lifetime pack years, particularly for recent smokers, as well as for
those who reported fewer years since quitting.
Postdiagnosis Cigarette Smoking and Mortality
The CWLS subcohort was generally similar to the entire CBCS
cohort with regard to baseline characteristics, including age (mean,
59 years for CWLS v 58 years for CBCS) and stage at breast cancer
diagnosis (73% localized for CWLS v 68% localized for CBCS;
Appendix Table A3). A total of 434 women (10%) reported actively
smoking after their breast cancer diagnoses (Appendix Table A4).
During a median follow-up of 11 years from return of the post-
diagnosis questionnaire, 988 deaths occurred. The two leading
causes of death were cardiovascular disease (258 deaths) and breast
cancer (246 deaths).
In the CWLS subcohort, ever smoking before or after diag-
nosis was associated with higher overall mortality and with risk of
death from breast cancer (Table 4) and from respiratory cancer,
noncancer
respiratory
disease,
and
cardiovascular
disease
(Appendix Table A5). Associations were strongest for women still
smoking after breast cancer diagnosis and who had heavy usage
(Table 5). Women who quit after diagnosis had elevated breast
cancer mortality relative to never smokers, but the difference was
not statistically significant (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.90).
Conversely, women who quit a minimum of 1 year before diagnosis
had equivalent breast cancer mortality as never smokers (HR, 0.98;
95% CI, 0.72 to 1.34). Although not reaching statistical sig-
nificance, when compared with women who continued to smoke
after diagnosis (a change in reference group from Table 4), those
who quit smoking after diagnosis had lower mortality from breast
cancer (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.19) and all causes (HR, 0.91;
95% CI, 0.67 to 1.20).
DISCUSSION
In this large prospective study of breast cancer survivors, recent
prediagnostic cigarette smokers were 25% more likely to die of
breast cancer than were those who never smoked. Although not
statistically significant, the women who quit smoking after their
breast cancer diagnosis had 33% lower risk of death as a result of
breast cancer than did women who continued to smoke after
diagnosis. Postdiagnosis quitters had a 9% lower risk of death as a
result of all causes than postdiagnosis smokers; this difference
included a statistically significant 60% lower risk of death from
respiratory cancer and a 20% lower risk of death as a result of
cardiovascular disease. Whether these findings are suggestive of a
biologic mechanism related to the carcinogenic properties of
tobacco smoke on tumor progression and metastasis or are related
to demographic, behavioral, or clinical factors is presently unclear.
This is, to our knowledge, the largest study to date of survival
outcomes according to smoking habits in women with a history of
breast cancer. The After Breast Cancer Pooling Project,35 a col-
laboration of three American cohort studies that enrolled nearly
10,000 patients with breast cancer, of whom approximately 1,000
had died of the disease, reported a statistically significant higher
mortality from breast cancer for active smokers near the time of
diagnosis relative to never smokers (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.28 to
2.03).22 A separate data pooling effort from five American cohort
studies that collectively observed 2,022 deaths from breast cancer
reported a more modest association (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.5).23
The CWLS is unique in the assessment of smoking habits both
before and after diagnosis. The Life After Cancer Epidemiology
study enrolled women with breast cancer, on average, approx-
imately 2 years after diagnosis (observing 244 deaths as a result of
breast cancer among 2,258 with the disease) and reported a strong
association with breast cancer–specific mortality for smokers
relative to never smokers at their baseline assessment (HR, 2.01;
95% CI, 1.27 to 3.18).19 In contrast, we used separate baseline and
postdiagnosis assessments, which permitted us to distinguish
prediagnosis and postdiagnosis quitters among former smokers.
In addition to characterizing smoking habits, including amount
and duration, the postdiagnosis assessment allowed incorporation
of important covariates that may have changed after diagnosis,
such as alcohol consumption36 and body mass index.37 The
relatively long follow-up period for the CWLS allowed us to

 comprehensively evaluate several different causes of death,
including respiratory diseases that have not traditionally been
assessed as outcomes in studies of breast cancer. Confidence in our
results for breast cancer–specific mortality are bolstered by the
striking, but expected, magnitude of associations observed for
respiratory cancer, respiratory disease, and cardiovascular disease.
We acknowledge a few specific study limitations. It is possible
that cancer survivors may misrepresent their smoking status.38
However, the observed prevalence of current smoking among long-
term breast cancer survivors (10%) was consistent with previous
reports.39,40 Participants were provided only a single occasion to
report postdiagnosis smoking habits, and we do not know whether
women who reported actively smoking at the time of the CWLS
questionnaire quit smoking thereafter. Although we evaluated
duration and intensity of smoking, we did not observe evidence of a
trend in breast cancer or overall mortality for age at smoking initiation
and for smoking status before first full-term pregnancy (data not
shown). Lifetime exposure to second-hand smoke was not considered.

Cigarette Smoking and Breast Cancer Mortality
 On the basis of the CBCS and CWLS designs, the post-
diagnosis subcohort included women with varied lengths of time
since diagnosis. Postdiagnosis HRs were calculated with respect to
time from follow-up questionnaire, not diagnosis. We adjusted for
the duration between diagnosis and questionnaire return, but we
found that results were not substantially different without this
adjustment. In light of these considerations, our results are
probably most generalizable to the population of long-term breast
cancer survivors.
We attempted to control for confounding by using multi-
variable regression and baseline hazard stratification. Statistical
models accounted for several breast cancer risk factors that we
hypothesized may also be related to survival and to stage at
diagnosis and mammography screening history. Alcohol con-
sumption and body mass index, important disease risk factors also
potentially related to survival and highly associated with cigarette
smoking habits, were included in models for prediagnosis smoking
and in models for postdiagnosis smoking by using updated
measurements from the CWLS questionnaire.
We lacked information on hormone receptor status of breast
tumors and could not separately evaluate breast cancer mortality
by estrogen-receptor, progesterone-receptor, or human epidermal

 growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu-status. Evidence of whether
the risk of developing hormone receptor–positive breast cancer
depends on smoking history is inconsistent.41-43 Detailed infor-
mation on second primaries and treatment of breast cancer was
also unavailable; thus, we could not evaluate the possibility that
smokers differentially have diminished efficacy of some treatments
or suffer from late effects of therapy, including cardiotoxicity.44,45
Our study was observational, and variables unaccounted for in our
analyses may contribute to confound the association between
cigarette smoking and breast cancer death. A randomized con-
trolled study of women diagnosed with breast cancer that compares
aggressive smoking cessation strategies to standard practice would
help establish a causal link.
Attributions of cause of death in those with cancer may
depend on numerous factors related to the long-term care of the
patient.46 In the CBCS cohort, fewer women died of breast cancer
(n = 2,894) than as a result of all other causes (n = 3,884). We did
not use competing risks models, which may explain why some
estimated HRs for breast cancer survival are less than 1 in com-
parisons of former to never smokers. Any cause-specific reduced
risk of death as a result of smoking likely reflects the overwhelming
higher risk of death as a result of another cause. Nonetheless, these
results underline the severity of comorbidities faced by both active
and former smokers with a history of breast cancer.
This large population-based study clarifies the long-term
adverse health consequences of women who quit smoking
before breast cancer diagnosis, those who quit smoking after breast
cancer diagnosis, and those who continue to smoke after breast
cancer diagnosis. Regardless of a diagnosis of breast cancer,
smokers should undergo recommended respiratory and car-
diovascular disease surveillance to reduce smoking-related mor-
tality. Our study reinforces the importance of cigarette smoking
cessation in women with breast cancer.47-49 For the minority of
breast cancer survivors who continue to smoke after their diag-
noses, these results should provide additional motivation to quit.

NOTE. Of the 1,000 deaths not attributed to breast cancer, respiratory cancer, other cancer, noncancer respiratory disease, or cardiovascular disease, the two most common causes of death were diseases of the
nervous system (ICD-9: 320-359; ICD-10: G00-G99), including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (n = 163 deaths), and mental and behavioral disorders (ICD-9: 290-319; ICD-10: F00-F99), including dementia (n = 149
deaths).
Abbreviations: HR, hazard ratio; ICD-9, International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision; ICD-10, International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision.
*Respiratory cancer includes neoplasms of the nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchus, lung, pleura, and intrathoracic organs.
†Noncancer respiratory disease includes acute upper and lower respiratory infections/syndromes, influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory
disorders.
‡Cardiovascular disease includes rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, ischemic heart disease, pulmonary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, arterial/vascular diseases, embolism, thrombosis, and
other disorders of the circulatory system.
§HR stratified by age at diagnosis, study phase, state of residence, and stage at diagnosis and adjusted for education, body mass index, parous status, age at first birth, menopausal status, use of postmenopausal
hormone therapy, mammography history, alcohol consumption, and first-degree family history of breast cancer.

NOTE. Of the 1,000 deaths not attributed to breast cancer, respiratory cancer, other cancer, noncancer respiratory disease, or cardiovascular disease, the two most common causes of death were diseases of the
nervous system (ICD-9: 320-359; ICD-10: G00-G99), including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (n = 163 deaths), and mental and behavioral disorders (ICD-9: 290-319; ICD-10: F00-F99), including dementia (n = 149
deaths).
Abbreviations: HR, hazard ratio; ICD-9, International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision; ICD-10, International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision.
*Respiratory cancer includes neoplasms of the nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchus, lung, pleura, and intrathoracic organs.
†Noncancer respiratory disease includes acute upper and lower respiratory infections/syndromes, influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory
