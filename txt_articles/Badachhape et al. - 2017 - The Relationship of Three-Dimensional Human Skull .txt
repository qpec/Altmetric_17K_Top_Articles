The Relationship of Three-
Dimensional Human Skull
Motion to Brain Tissue
Deformation in Magnetic
Resonance Elastography Studies
In traumatic brain injury (TBI), membranes such as the dura mater, arachnoid mater,
and pia mater play a vital role in transmitting motion from the skull to brain tissue. Mag-
netic resonance elastography (MRE) is an imaging technique developed for noninvasive
estimation of soft tissue material parameters. In MRE, dynamic deformation of brain tis-
sue is induced by skull vibrations during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); however,
skull motion and its mode of transmission to the brain remain largely uncharacterized. In
this study, displacements of points in the skull, reconstructed using data from an array of
MRI-safe accelerometers, were compared to displacements of neighboring material
points in brain tissue, estimated from MRE measurements. Comparison of the relative
amplitudes, directions, and temporal phases of harmonic motion in the skulls and brains
of six human subjects shows that the skull–brain interface significantly attenuates and
delays transmission of motion from skull to brain. In contrast, in a cylindrical gelatin
“phantom,” displacements of the rigid case (reconstructed from accelerometer data)
were transmitted to the gelatin inside (estimated from MRE data) with little attenuation
or phase lag. This quantitative characterization of the skull–brain interface will be valua-
ble in the parameterization and validation of computer models of TBI. [DOI: 10.1115/

Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent neurological disor-
der where brain tissue is damaged by an external force [1]. Diffuse
axonal injury, or shearing and stretching of axonal fibers, is a
common type of TBI often caused by sudden linear or angular
accelerations of the head [2]. While the effects of TBI are well
documented, the mechanisms linking mechanical insult and neu-
rological injury are not well understood. Mathematical modeling
and computer simulation of TBI can provide insight into these
mechanisms, and guide the development of new methods for
injury prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and management. How-
ever, to be useful, computer models require accurate descriptions
of material behavior, boundary conditions, and loading. Recent
research has largely focused on the material properties of brain
tissue; however, quantitative characterization of the skull–brain
interface in vivo remains an important need.
Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a prominent tool
for assessing the properties of brain tissue in vivo. MRE is a non-
invasive MRI technique that enables assessment of the dynamic
mechanical properties of living biological tissues [3,4]. In MRE
of the brain, vibrations are applied to the skull in order to induce
shear waves throughout the brain [5–7]. These shear waves are
observed using MRE imaging sequences with motion-encoding
gradients that oscillate at the vibration frequency, producing phase
contrast images proportional to displacement [3,4]. The speeds of
shear waves in soft tissue are determined by its mechanical prop-
erties [5–7]. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of
MRE to provide local estimates of the mechanical properties of
healthy brain tissue [8–11], as well as changes in brain material
properties due to development, aging, injury, or disease [12–15].
MRE is also a valuable tool for parameterizing and validating
computational models of TBI [16,17]. A number of methods exist
to estimate material properties in soft tissue, such as local direct
inversion (LDI) [18], nonlinear inversion (NLI) [19,20], or local
frequency estimation (LFE) [21].
In contrast to the substantial progress on estimation of brain
material properties, the transmission of skull motion to brain tis-
sue motion has not been extensively characterized. Inside the
skull, the brain is encased in multiple membranes including the
dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. As the skull moves,
these membranes, together with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
blood contained between the various layers, cushion the brain and
limit its displacement [22,23]. Together, these membranes and
fluid layers comprise the skull–brain interface and play an impor-
tant role in injury mechanics. Modeling the characteristics of the
skull–brain interface is challenging, however [24]. While experi-
mental studies of ex vivo tissue samples have provided some

 insight into the properties of the constituent materials [5,6,8],
characterization of the intact skull–brain interface in vivo is desir-
able [22–24].
To characterize the role of the intact skull–brain interface in
transmitting forces and motion to brain tissue, we record skull
motion during MRE studies using an array of three MRI-safe tri-
axial accelerometers, and then compare skull kinematics to brain
tissue displacements estimated from MRE measurements. By con-
trasting the transmission of motion from skull to brain in human
subjects to the analogous motion transmission from case to gel in
a homogenous gelatin phantom, we quantify how the skull–brain
interface attenuates and delays the brain’s response to skull
motion.

Methods
2.1
MRE Imaging Procedures and Instrumentation. MRE
imaging of six adult, male human subjects and a cylindrical gela-
tin phantom was performed on Siemens TrioV
R 3T MRI scanners
located at the Beckman Institute at University of Illinois in
Urbana-Champaign and the Center for Clinical Imaging Research
at Washington University in St. Louis, MO. All studies were
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the respec-
tive institutions.
Subjects lay supine with their heads centered in a Siemens 12
channel head coil. Skull vibrations were induced at a frequency of
50 Hz through a commercially available mechanical actuator
(ResoundantTM, Rochester, MN) using a pillow-like actuator
(Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) positioned on the back of the sub-
ject’s head at the skull occipital protuberance [12]. The head rests
on the pillow, and is stabilized by pads placed laterally. Skull vibra-
tions were induced at 18% ResoundantTM amplitude. Three-
dimensional skull kinematics were measured using three MRI safe
tri-axial accelerometers (TSD109C2-MRI, BIOPAC#, Goleta,
CA) embedded in an array constructed from a commercial sports
mouth guard and three-dimensional (3D)-printed interface (Fig. 1).
This accelerometer mouth-guard array (MGA) was designed to
allow for rigid placement of the accelerometers and easy retrieval
from the subject during the scanning protocol. The relative posi-
tions of the MGA and the pillow actuator were identified with vita-
min E capsules that appeared with high signal in the field of view
of T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. Subject brain
volume (1378 6 192 cm3) was calculated through segmentation of
gray and white matter tracts in T1-weighted MRI data [25].
A multishot spiral MRE sequence with 2 mm isotropic voxels
was used to measure brain tissue displacement, which is encoded
as phase in the resulting MR images [20]. Imaging parameters
included 26 mT/m motion-encoding gradient strength (MEGS),
6 k-space interleaves, eight phase offsets, and twenty axial slice
acquisition in the region of the corpus callosum (Fig. 2(b)), with
an image volume of 240 mm � 240 mm � 40 mm and a scan dura-
tion of approximately 11 min. The accelerometers are MRI-safe,
meaning they are composed of material that poses no hazard
within an MRI environment. While MRI-safe, the accelerometers
induced imaging artifacts, thus a single slice scan with duration of
approximately 36 s was performed in order to record skull acceler-
ation during the MRE sequence. After this scan, The MGA was
removed while the subject’s head remained in the head coil and
the full, 20 slice MRE scan was performed.
To provide an MR phantom with simpler properties that could
be used to validate techniques and compare behavior, a cylindrical
phantom (�13 cm long and 13 cm in diameter) was fabricated

 from a plastic case filled with 1.65 L (1.81 kg) of a gelatin-glycerol-
water solution (4% gelatin, 48% glycerol, and 48% water by weight
[26]). For brevity, this mixture is referred to as gelatin. The gelatin
phantom was refrigerated for a minimum of 12 h to allow the gelatin
to set. The gelatin phantom was equilibrated for 3 h at room temper-
ature before imaging. The storage modulus, or real part of the visco-
elastic shear modulus, of gelatin samples was 1.8 kPa, as measured
with dynamic shear testing at 50 Hz [26]. A 3D printed holder was
used to rigidly attach the MGA to the outer surface of the gelatin
phantom’s cylindrical plastic case. The gelatin phantom was posi-
tioned in the head coil, stabilized laterally with pads, and vibrated
using the pillow actuator at 50Hz. The lower weight of the gelatin
phantom, 1.8 kg compared to approximately 3.5–4.5kg for the
human skull [27], necessitated a ResoundantTM actuation amplitude
of 3% to minimize phase wrapping of the MRE images.
Our experimental protocol thus involved the following steps:
(1) Position subject outside the scanner bore with the acceler-
ometer MGA.
(2) Record skull accelerations in response to the pillow actua-
tor without the spiral MRE sequence running.
(3) Move subject into the scanner bore and acquire accelerom-
eter data from a single-slice MRE sequence.
(4) Remove the MGA without removing the subject’s head
from the coil.
(5) Run anatomical scan (T1-weighted: 3D magnetization pre-
pared rapid gradient, 0.9 mm isotropic voxels) and 20-slice
spiral MRE sequence.
This protocol enabled comparison of skull dynamics (recon-
structed from accelerometer data) and brain tissue displacement
(estimated from MRE measurements) in the same subject.
2.2
Estimation of 3D Skull Kinematics. Skull motion during
MRE at 50 Hz is well approximated as rigid-body motion [28];
standard 3D kinematic equations for rigid-body acceleration (Eqs.
(1a)–(1c)) [29] are used. Here, a is linear acceleration, a is angular
acceleration, r defines the distance between some point and the
skull origin (approximated as the posterior clinoid process), and x
is angular velocity. Each of these vectors consists of three compo-
nents, denoted as x, y, and z, to represent the right–left (RL),
anterior–posterior (AP), and superior–inferior (SI) directions.
Thus, (aO
x , aO
y ; aO
z ) are, respectively, the RL, AP, and SI linear
accelerations of the skull origin; (xx, xy, xz) are rates of rotation
(angular velocity) about the RL, AP, and SI directions, respec-
tively; and (ax, ay, az) are the components of angular acceleration.
(ax, ay; az) are the components of linear acceleration of a point
whose position, measured from the skull origin, is (rx; ry; rz).
The right-hand side of these equations will contain nine unknowns
(three components of motion for each of a, a, and x at the skull
origin), which can be solved using the known values of linear
acceleration at the positions of the tri-axial accelerometers

To provide additional information, rigid-body velocity expres-

Displacements at four discrete points: anterior (A) near the
forehead, right (R) by the right temple, left (L) by the left temple,
and posterior (P) near the skull occipital protuberance (Figs. 2(a)
and 2(c)) were reconstructed from acceleration data. Reconstruc-
tion points and the skull origin were located from T1-weighted
anatomical scans (Fig. 2(b)). On the gelatin phantom, anterior,
right, left, and posterior reconstruction points were similarly cho-
sen as central points along each cylinder edge.
To test the accuracy of motion reconstruction, we performed
known translational and rotational motions (Fig. 3), measured
accelerations with an independent sensor, and compared these
data to the accelerations reconstructed from simultaneous meas-
urements with the accelerometer array (MGA). Oscillatory rota-
tional motion was generated by a Torsional Plant 205 (ECP#,
Bell Canyon, CA) at a frequency of 10 Hz while translational
motion was generated with an Electro-seis 113 Long Stroke
Shaker (APS Dynamics#, San Juan Capistrano, CA) at a fre-
quency of 50 Hz. The MGA was mounted on the moving section
of each device. An additional accelerometer was placed on each
device to serve as a reference. For rotational experiments, the
MGA was oriented so that the motion corresponded to rotation
about the RL axis. For linear motion, the MGA was oriented so
translation was in the AP direction. The normalized root-mean-
square error (NRMSE) was calculated from the RMS difference
between the acceleration reconstructed from the MGA and the
recorded signal from the reference accelerometer, normalized by
the reference acceleration magnitude. In the rotational experi-
ment, NRMSE was 0.04 in the AP direction and 0.02 in the SI
direction. In the translational experiment, NRMSE was 0.04 in the
AP direction and 0.08 in the SI direction. Noise, nonrigid motion,
and nonlinearity can contribute to reconstruction error; these are
more apparent in low-amplitude harmonic signal, such as in the
translational experiment SI motion. However, since the SI compo-
nent is a small fraction of the acceleration magnitude, its contribu-
tion to the overall error is small.
2.3
Analysis of MRE Displacement
Measurements. In
MRE, motion-encoding gradients in the MRI sequence encode
displacement as phase of the MR signal [20,31]. Oscillating gra-
dients are applied along three orthogonal directions to capture
motion-induced phase at each voxel in space. The resulting
motion-induced MRE phase contrast (U) is proportional to the
component of the oscillatory displacement (u) in the direction of
the gradient [3,31]. MRE phase contrast includes the effects of
oscillatory rigid-body motion, longitudinal wave motion, and
shear wave motion. During imaging, oscillatory, rigid-body
motion can be described through both translation in the x, y; and z
directions along with rotation about each of those axes. Addition-
ally, when the amplitude of motion is large, motion-induced phase
wrapping may occur. This was commonly seen in the phase-
encoded anterior–posterior component of motion. Wrapped phase
was spatially unwrapped using FSL PRELUDE [32] and tempo-
rally
unwrapped
using

algorithm
described in Appendix A.1. A separate experiment using variable
gradient strength in MRE of a single subject provided validation
of the unwrapping approach used in this study (Fig. 10).
After unwrapping the MRE phase data, the three complex dis-
placement components at each voxel were obtained by converting
phase to displacement (Appendix A.2) and extracting the first har-
monic using a temporal Fourier transform. Components of rigid-
body displacement (�
u) were estimated for comparison with skull
motion reconstructed from the accelerometers. A set of three rota-
tion components (hx; hy; and hz) and three translation compo-
nents (�
uO
x , �
uO
y , and �
uO
z ) about the brain origin were used to
describe 3D, rigid-body displacement in the brain at each voxel
location (denoted by position r with respect to the brain origin).
These complex components were solved by least squares fitting of
the total displacement (estimated from MRE data) at all voxels
within the brain to a model of rigid-body displacement

The contribution of shear and longitudinal waves to the dis-
placement field (~
u) was estimated by removing rigid-body motion
from the total displacement field estimate. In addition, in an iso-
tropic, uniform, elastic or viscoelastic material, the curl of the dis-
placement field contains only contributions of shear waves. The
curl (CÞ was estimated through local polynomial fitting and differ-
entiation of the displacement field to provide a separate estimate
of the contribution of shear waves. Wave motion for both human
subjects and the gelatin phantom are reported in terms of both
wave displacement and curl. Strain magnitudes resulting from
wave propagation are reported as octahedral shear strain (es) [33].
For comparison with estimates of strain and curl (nondimensional
measures of displacement per unit length), the displacement of the
case or skull was normalized by the radius of the case or the major
semi-axis of the skull.
To characterize brain tissue displacements in different regions
and compare them with skull motion at specific locations, MRE
measurements were separated into twelve regions of interest
(ROI) including three shells (outer, middle, and inner) and four
quadrants (anterior, A; right, R; left, L; and posterior, P) (Fig.
2(d)). MRE measurements in the gelatin phantom were separated
similarly into 12 ROIs: four corresponding A, P, R, and L quad-
rants, and three shells.

mates of skull displacement at four material points in the skull

 points in the brain (estimated from MRE measurements). In gen-
eral harmonic motion, where the three components of motion are
not exactly in phase, the 3D trajectory of each point in the
brain and skull is an ellipse, represented as a complex coefficient
vector, u0, multiplied by a complex exponential in time, uðtÞ ¼
u0 expðiXtÞ (Appendix A.3). The elliptical trajectories of material
points in skull and brain tissue were described by their relative
amplitudes, spatial orientations, and temporal phase. The amplitude
of each elliptical trajectory is reported as its mean radius: the cir-
cumference of the corresponding ellipse divided by 2p.
Consider two 3D complex coefficient vectors u0 and v0, corre-
sponding to elliptical trajectories of skull motion and brain tissue
rigid-body motion, respectively. The vectors normal to the two
elliptical trajectories are used to calculate the spatial, angle, b.
The dot product of the two complex coefficient vectors can be
used to calculate temporal phase shift, u [34]. The vector normal
to each ellipse is found from the cross product of the real and
imaginary components of the coefficient vectors, as shown in the
below equations
Nu ¼ Re½u0� � Im½u0�

In order to compare the phases of skull and brain motion captured

3.1
Motion of the Human Skull and Gelatin Phantom Case
Reconstructed From Acceleration Data. During MRE imaging
of human subjects, the ResoundantTM system causes the pillow
actuator to vibrate the back of the skull. Examples of accelerations
reconstructed at the anterior, right, and posterior points are shown
in Fig. 4. The acceleration magnitudes typically ranged from 2 to
5 m/s2. Acceleration components reconstructed at the left (L) and
right (R) skull points were similar in magnitude and phase. The SI
component of acceleration was largest at the posterior. AP accel-
eration magnitudes were similar at all reconstruction points. Data
generally suggest a combination of AP linear acceleration and
rotation of the skull about the RL axis. The mean magnitudes of
the components of skull acceleration for the six human subjects
are compared to those of the gelatin phantom case in Table 1. The
gelatin phantom case had lower acceleration amplitude than
the human skull, and the largest component was consistently in
the AP direction, even at the posterior reconstruction point.
To characterize the uncertainty in the accelerometer measure-
ments obtained during MRE in the absence of a reference acceler-
ometer, we compared the accelerations reconstructed at the
positions of the embedded accelerometers to the recorded acceler-
ometer data. NRMSE for each acceleration component was
obtained by averaging the NRMSE of that component for the
three accelerometers in the MGA. Normalized errors for recon-
structed accelerations in human studies were: NRMSE ¼ 0.05 (RL
direction), NRMSE ¼ 0.10 (AP direction), and NRMSE ¼ 0.07 (SI
direction). In the gelatin phantom, reconstructed data also showed
reasonable agreement with recorded values: NRMSE ¼ 0.13 (RL
direction), NRMSE ¼ 0.10 (AP direction), and NRMSE ¼ 0.16 (SI
direction). The higher NRMSE in the gel phantom is likely due to
the lower amplitude of acceleration, which leads to a lower
signal-to-noise ratio in the data.

Motion of Human Brain Tissue and Phantom Gelatin
Estimated From MRE Measurements. Rigid-body motion and
wave motion in both gelatin and brain tissue were estimated from
MRE measurements, as described previously. In the gelatin
phantom, most of the total displacement field is due to wave dis-
placement (Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)). In human subjects, the MRE
measurements reflect a relatively uniform displacement field with
high amplitude in the AP direction (Fig. 5(d)), suggesting a larger
contribution from rigid-body motion than from wave displace-
ment fields. Amplitudes of wave displacement and curl in the gel-
atin phantom (Figs. 5(b) and 5(c)) were higher relative to total
displacement than in human brain tissue.
3.3
Comparison of Case and Gelatin Motion in the Gelatin
Phantom. Motion trajectories at four points on the case (esti-
mated from accelerometer measurements) were compared to tra-
jectories at four material points inside the gelatin (estimated from
MRE measurements). These comparisons were characterized by
relative amplitude, orientation, and phase (Fig. 6). The rigid-body
motion of the gelatin and case were similar in amplitude, particu-
larly the dominant components of rotation (hRL) and translation
(�
uO
AP). The spatial angle between rigid-body motion of the gelatin
and rigid-body motion of the case indicated high alignment of gel
and case motion (Table 2). The phase shift between case and gela-
tin rigid-body motion was consistently low.
The magnitudes of wave displacement in gelatin were larger
than the amplitudes of rigid-body motion of both the case and gel-
atin (Fig. 7). No qualitative differences in curl, displacement, or
strain amplitudes were seen between shells or quadrants.

Comparison of Skull and Brain Motion in Human
Subjects. Brain motion (estimated from MRE measurements) and
skull motion (reconstructed from accelerometer measurements)
were compared for six subjects. As in the gelatin phantom, ellipti-
cal trajectories of neighboring material points were used to com-
pare brain and skull rigid-body motion (Fig. 8). In contrast to the
gelatin phantom, the amplitude of rigid-body motion in the brain
differed from the amplitude of nearby skull motion. At each of the
brain material points, the AP component of translation was consis-
tently the highest amplitude, while the skull experienced high
amplitudes in both AP and SI directions. Rigid-body motion of the
brain and skull exhibited greater differences in spatial angle than
were seen between the case and contents of the gelatin phantom
(Table 3). The phase shift between rigid-body motion in brain and
skull was consistently longer than between case and gelatin in the
gelatin phantom.
The amplitude of wave motion in brain tissue was lower than
the amplitude of reconstructed skull motion (Fig. 9) in all quad-
rants and shells. The displacement amplitudes in the outer and

amplitudes of curl and strain also decreased progressively in
regions closer to the center of the brain.

Discussion and Conclusion
In this study, we directly characterized skull kinematics using
accelerometers in order to relate skull motion to brain tissue
motion. To describe brain tissue motion, MRE measurements of
displacement were decomposed into wave motion and rigid-body
motion. Comparing skull kinematics with brain tissue motion
in vivo enables assessment of relative motion and deformation.
Furthermore, comparison of data from human subjects to data
from a gelatin phantom (in which the gelatin adheres to the cylin-
drical case) provides insight into how the skull–brain interface (a
more complex material interface) affects motion transmission.

 The effects of the skull–brain interface are illuminated by com-
parison to the coupling of case to gelatin in the gelatin phantom.
In the phantom, harmonic, rigid-body displacements of both gela-
tin and case were similar. Material points in the case and material
points in gelatin exhibited elliptical trajectories due to rigid-body
motion. The elliptical trajectories of neighboring points on oppo-
site sides of the adherent interface exhibited similar amplitude,
direction (spatial angle), and temporal phase. While we expect
particles in the case and in the gelatin at the interface to have
almost identical trajectories, discrepancies in the rigid-body
motions are apparent (for example, Fig. 6). There are several
likely reasons: (i) gelatin motion includes both rigid-body and
wave motion; (ii) the case is not perfectly rigid (which introduces
some error into the estimate of case motion); (iii) motion esti-
mates from MRE are average values within a finite region of inter-
est. Displacements in the gelatin due to waves were consistently
higher than the displacements due to rigid-body motion of the gel-
atin and case. It is likely that harmonic excitation at 50 Hz induces
constructive wave interactions in the weakly dissipative gelatin,
causing higher displacement fields in the interior.
In contrast, displacement fields in the human brain exhibited
higher amplitudes of rigid-body motion than wave motion. Fur-
thermore, rigid-body motion of the brain differed strongly from
rigid-body motion of the skull. Considering first the rigid-body
components of motion, elliptical trajectories of material points in
the brain exhibited significant differences in amplitude, orienta-
tion (spatial angle), and temporal phase compared to elliptical tra-
jectories of neighboring points on the skull. Wave components of
displacement in the brain were even smaller relative to skull
motion; displacements due to waves at material points in the brain
were an order of magnitude smaller than displacements of neigh-
boring material points in the skull. In addition, waves were attenu-
ated significantly as they propagated inward from the outer
cortical surface toward the midbrain.
These results indicate significant mechanical compliance and
dissipation at the skull–brain interface. These properties are attrib-
utable to the dural membranes, blood vessels, and fluids that com-
prise the interface. In contrast, the gelatin phantom has none of
these structures, and the adherent interface between gelatin and
case exhibits dramatically simpler behavior.
Some experimental limitations are acknowledged. All analyses
performed in this study assumed perfect coupling between the
accelerometers and the skull. In practice, this is unlikely; slip or
compliance will affect the transmission of motion from the jaw,
via the commercial mouth guard, to the accelerometer array. How-
ever, by using the same array in the gel phantom, we demonstrate
that these effects are not dominant. Accelerations were assumed
to be harmonic; Fourier components at a single frequency were
converted to displacement in the frequency domain for compari-
son with MRE measurements. As noted in the description of
experimental methods, and in the Appendix, the methods for mea-
surement and reconstruction of skull kinematics from accelerome-
ter data were validated in separate experiments.
Substantial variation in acceleration (Table 1) and spatial angle
(Table 3) between skull and brain motion is seen over the cohort of
six subjects. These variations likely reflect intersubject differences
in head size, shape, and anatomy, as well as individual responses to
actuation and variations in subject and actuator positioning.
Despite intersubject variability, subjects consistently showed
higher amplitudes of skull translation in the AP and SI directions,
relative to RL translation, and higher amplitudes of rotation about
the RL axis, relative to other rotation components. Additionally,
recorded human MRE data are consistent with results reported by
other groups using a similar actuation system [20].
Future work should explore the possibility of frequency-
dependent, anisotropic, and nonlinear mechanical behavior of the
skull–brain interface. Different actuation locations and frequen-
cies could be used to investigate such behavior. Additionally,
MRE data from the entire brain could be compared to a more
extensive set of reconstruction points on the skull.
This study confirms that the skull–brain interface is a critical
determinant of brain tissue deformation due to skull loading, and
thus is a major factor in TBI. The properties of this interface are
measurable; the quantitative data from this study should be of
immediate use in the parameterization and validation of computer
models and simulations of TBI. The properties of the skull–brain
interface are also critical to the development of strategies for
MRE of the brain, in which enhanced transmission of waves into
the brain is desirable. The compliant and dissipative nature of the
skull–brain interface clearly protects the brain during mild skull
accelerations. Further studies are needed to determine the condi-
tions under which this protective system may fail.

Unwrapping MRE Phase Contrast
MRE phase contrast (U) is originally constrained to the principal
range ð�p; p�, which can cause wrapping and complicate recovery
of the original amplitude. To validate our unwrapping approach, an
echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used to acquire MRE data
from a single human subject at motion-encoding gradient strengths
(MEGS) between 4 and 25.9 mT/m (Fig. 10). Imaging parameters
included 3 mm isotropic voxels, 240 mm field of view, and 24 axial
slices. As in the two-dimensional spiral sequence, MRE data that
encoded displacements in the AP direction were often wrapped
when acquired at high motion-encoding gradient strengths. In addi-
tion to phase wrapping in space (which is already a challenging
problem [35,36]), the harmonic data may also be wrapped in time.
Unwrapping in time is further challenging due to the very coarse
sampling: eight points per period. Therefore, to accurately recover

 the harmonic time series, we used a custom temporal postprocessing
algorithm following initial spatial unwrapping of 3D volumes with
a widely used, third-party algorithm (FSL PRELUDE [32]). The
temporal postprocessing algorithm consisted of tabulating all possi-
ble permutations of the motion-encoded phase at a selected voxel,
with a value of 0; �2p; or 2p added at each time point. This
resulted in 38, or 6561 permutations. The eight-point FFT of each
permutation was calculated, and the permutation that contained the
highest fraction of power at the fundamental frequency FFT, was
then selected as the unwrapping solution. As Fig. 10 shows, the
rigid-body motion is homogeneous across the field of view, mean-
ing that the same unwrapping scheme was used for each voxel. We
then acquired MRE data at lower MEGS to view an unwrapped AP
phase contrast waveform in the same subject. Data from this proto-
col confirmed that MRE phase contrast was proportional to the
strength of the motion encoding gradients. The MRE phase wave-
form acquired at lower MEGS was used as a template to check the
unwrapped solution for the waveform at higher MEGS.

Relating MR Sequence Timing With
Accelerometer Recordings
Artifacts such as aliasing and sudden changes in amplitude in the
accelerometer trace corresponded with landmarks in the MRE
sequence such as the spiral gradients and refocusing pulse (Fig. 11).
To relate the phases of skull motion and brain motion, the center of
the 180 deg refocusing pulse was chosen as a common temporal
landmark for synchronizing the accelerometer and MRE signals.
The relative phase of the accelerometer recordings was determined
from the FFT of the accelerometer time series, setting the initial
time point at the center of the refocusing pulse. The relative phase
shift of the MRE signal was found directly from the FFT of the
time series of MRE phase contrast, which is already referenced to
the center of the refocusing pulse.

monic displacement field uðr; tÞ is

Elliptical Trajectories Described by Complex

where rn is the amplitude and wn is the phase of each component.
In harmonic motion, the trajectory shape is determined by the rel-
ative amplitudes and phases of these components as shown in
Fig. 12. When all three components are exactly in phase, that is
w1 ¼ w2 ¼ w3, the trajectory collapses to a straight line (Fig.
12(a)). If the three components have different temporal phase,
however, then the resulting trajectory is an ellipse (Fig. 12(b)).
For our analysis, we determined the relative spatial orientation of
two elliptical trajectories by finding the spatial angle between the
vectors normal to the plane of each ellipse (Fig. 12(c)). The nor-
mal vectors are calculated from the cross product of the real and
imaginary parts of the coefficient vectors.
