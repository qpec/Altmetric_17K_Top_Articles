Abstract
Many non-cigarette tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, contain various flavorings, such as 
fruit flavours. Although many flavorings used in e-cigarettes are generally recognized as safe 
when used in food products, concerns have been raised about the potential inhalation toxicity of 
these chemicals. Benzaldehyde, which is a key ingredient in natural fruit flavors, has been shown 
to cause irritation of respiratory airways in animal and occupational exposure studies. Given the 
potential inhalation toxicity of this compound, we measured benzaldehyde in aerosol generated in 
a laboratory setting from flavored e-cigarettes purchased online and detected benzaldehyde in 108 
out of 145 products. The highest levels of benzaldehyde were detected in cherry flavored products. 
The benzaldehyde doses inhaled with 30 puffs from flavored e-cigarettes were often higher than 
doses inhaled from a conventional cigarette. Levels in cherry flavored products were over 1000 
times lower than doses inhaled in the workplace. While e-cigarettes seem to be a promising harm 
reduction tool for smokers, findings indicate that using these products could result in repeated 
inhalation of benzaldehyde, with long-term users risking regular exposure to the substance. Given 
the uncertainty surrounding adverse health effects stemming from long-term inhalation of 
flavoring ingredients such as benzaldehyde, clinicians need to be aware of this emerging risk and 
ask their patients about use of flavored e-cigarettes.

  To the editor
Current estimates show that 12.6% of U.S. adults report ever use of electronic cigarettes (e-
cigarettes), a number which continues to rise. [1] Recent studies confirm that e-cigarettes 
presumably pose lower health risks to the user due to the disparity in toxic compounds found 
in e-cigarettes relative to tobacco cigarettes. [2] While the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention 
and Tobacco Control Act gave rise to a U.S. ban on added, non-menthol flavorings in 
cigarettes [3], currently, non-cigarette tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, are permitted 
to have added flavorings (ex: candy, fruit). Although many flavorings used in e-cigarettes are 
generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in food products, concerns have been raised 
about the potential inhalation toxicity of these chemicals [4]. The potential effects flavor 
compounds may have on the respiratory health of e-cigarette users is unclear. A recent report 
by Barrington-Trimis et al (2014) outlined the need for research on flavor additives used in 
e-cigarettes, noting the lack of safety data on long-term health effects from inhaling 
flavoring chemicals [4].
One such flavoring compound, benzaldehyde, is an aromatic aldehyde used in food and 
cosmetics. [5] Although data suggest little to no toxicity from oral and dermal exposure to 
benzaldehyde, occupational exposure has been linked to irritation of the eyes and mucous 
membranes of the respiratory passages. [5] Given the potential inhalation toxicity of 
benzaldehyde to e-cigarette users, we examined benzaldehyde levels generated from 
flavored e-cigarettes. We hypothesized that aerosol generated from flavored e-cigarettes 
would contain significant amounts of benzaldehyde.
 Methods
We measured benzaldehyde in aerosol generated from an e-cigarette refilled with 145 
flavored nicotine-containing solutions purchased from international online retailers. The 
solutions were classified into eight flavor groups according to labelled characteristics: berry/
tropical fruit (n=40), tobacco (n=37), alcohol related/drink (n=15), chocolate/sweet flavor 
(n=11), coffee/tea (n=11), mint/menthol (n=10), cherry (n=10), and other, non-identifiable 
flavor varieties (e.g, “Indian Summer”, “Cosmopolitan”) (n=11). A refillable eGo e-cigarette 
(heater resistance 2.4 ohm, battery 900 mAh, 3.4 V) was used for testing. Aerosol was 
generated using an automatic smoking simulator following protocols used in previous 
studies (inhalation time 1.8 s, puff volume 70 ml, interval between puffs 17 s). [6] For each 
experiment, 30 puffs were taken from each e-cigarette in two series of 15 puffs, with a 5-min 
interval between series. Benzaldehyde from aerosol was trapped on sorbent tubes, extracted, 
and analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method as 
recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [7]. The lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ) was 0.025 μg/30 puffs. A Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to assess 
differences in the distributions of benzaldehyde levels according to flavor grouping. For each 
product tested, we calculated a daily inhaled dose of benzaldehyde, assuming that an 
experienced e-cigarette user puffs on an e-cigarette 163 times a day [8]. We compared the 
inhaled dose using 30 puffs from a flavored e-cigarette with an inhaled dose from a single 
tobacco cigarette (0.5–4.5 μg/cigarette)[9]. We also compared the inhaled dose from flavored 
e-cigarettes with a hypothetical dose inhaled by healthy workers who would be exposed

 during an 8-hr work shift to the permissible exposure limit (PEL) of benzaldehyde as 
defined by the U.S. Workplace Environmental Exposure Level (WEEL) Guides. [10] 
(90.5mg = inhalation rate 1.3 4m3/hr × 8 hrs × 8.7 mg/m3 PEL).
 Results
Benzaldehyde was detected in 108 out of 145 examined products (levels above LLOQ). The 
highest yields of benzaldehyde were observed in cherry-flavored products (5.129 – 141.2 
μg/30 puffs). Benzaldehyde yields in aerosol generated from cherry-flavored nicotine 
solutions were significantly higher than in other products (χ2(7)=43.70, p<0.0001; Kruskal-
Wallis Test). Benzaldehyde yields in non-cherry flavored products were within the range of 
0.025 to 10.27 μg/30 puffs (Table 1). The benzaldehyde doses inhaled using 30 puffs from 
flavored e-cigarettes were often higher than doses inhaled from a conventional cigarette. The 
estimated median daily inhaled dose of benzaldehyde from cherry-flavored e-cigarettes was 
70.3 μg, which would be over one thousand times lower than the PEL dose for benzaldehyde 
concentrations in the workplace (Figure 1).
 Discussion
By examining benzaldehyde levels in aerosols generated from a wide range of flavored 
nicotine solutions, our study demonstrated that elevated levels of benzaldehyde exist in 
cherry flavored products. Users of cherry flavored products may inhale significantly higher 
doses of benzaldehyde compared to users of other flavored products. Although this study has 
several limitations, including an arbitrarily selected testing protocol which may not reflect 
actual product use, this study points out a potential risk associated with using flavored e-
cigarettes.
As e-cigarette popularity increases, respiratory clinicians need to be aware of potential risks 
that may result from use. Although e-cigarettes may be a promising harm reduction tool for 
smokers, findings indicate that using these products could result in repeated inhalation of 
benzaldehyde, with long-term users risking regular exposure to the substance. Given the 
uncertainty surrounding adverse health effects stemming from long-term inhalation of 
flavoring ingredients such as benzaldehyde, patients should be asked about use of flavored 
products, particularly patients with respiratory diseases.
