Accumulation of Tau is a characteristic hallmark of several neurode-
generative diseases but the mode of toxic action of Tau is poorly
understood. Here, we show that the Tau protein is toxic due to its
aggregation propensity, whereas phosphorylation and/or missort-
ing is not sufficient to cause neuronal dysfunction. Aggregate-prone
Tau accumulates, when expressed in vitro at near-endogenous levels,
in axons as spindle-shaped grains. These axonal grains contain Tau
that is folded in a pathological (MC-1) conformation. Proaggregant
Tau induces a reduction of neuronal ATP, concomitant with loss of
dendritic spines. Counterintuitively, axonal grains of Tau are not
targeted for degradation and do not induce a molecular stress
response. Proaggregant Tau causes neuronal and astrocytic hypo-
activity and presynaptic dysfunction instead. Here, we show that
the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline (KW-3902) is alle-
viating the presynaptic dysfunction and restores neuronal activity
as well as dendritic spine levels in vitro. Oral administration of
rolofylline for 2-wk to 14-mo-old proaggregant Tau transgenic
mice restores the spatial memory deficits and normalizes the basic
synaptic transmission. These findings make rolofylline an interest-
ing candidate to combat the hypometabolism and neuronal dys-
function associated with Tau-induced neurodegenerative diseases.

T
he Tau protein is well known for stabilizing microtubules in
neurons, although in a subset of neurodegenerative disorders
called tauopathies [e.g., Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal
lobar degeneration (FTLD), Pick disease, etc.] Tau becomes
modified (e.g., by hyperphosphorylation, acetylation, proteolytic
processing, etc.), leading to neurofibrillary tangles (1). Alterna-
tively, Tau can assemble as spindle-shaped grains, as in argyrophilic
grain disease (AGD). Mutations within the repeat domain of the
Tau protein can increase its β-sheet propensity (e.g., mutations
P301L, ΔK280, and others), leading to missorting and aggregation
of Tau (2, 3). In humans, such mutations can cause typical FTLD
pathology with corresponding neurofibrillary tangles (4). In trans-
genic mice expressing human Tau with the ΔK280 mutation, the
Tau protein is missorted into the somatodendritic compartment,
(hyper)phosphorylated, and folded into a pathological conforma-
tion (MC-1 epitope) (5). These mice are still functionally impaired
from ∼12 mo onward despite the absence of neurofibrillary tangles
(6). Here, we use this transgenic human Tau model (ΔK280,
proaggregant) in parallel with its antiaggregant counterpart
(ΔK280-PP line) where Tau cannot aggregate because of Ile-to-
Pro mutations that serve as β-sheet breakers (7). Both types of
Tau bind similarly to microtubules but differ in their aggregation
potential (8). Noxious stimuli [e.g., hypoxia or amyloid-β (Aβ)]
increase adenosine levels 30–100 times in the brain (9). Adenosine
is a neuromodulator and has a depressant effect on neuronal
activity when bound to the ubiquitously expressed adenosine A1
receptor, a Gi/G0-protein coupled receptor (10, 11). Hypometabolism
(i.e., diminished neuronal activity) is strongly associated with neu-
rodegeneration (12–14). Moreover, pathological Tau can disrupt
ongoing network activity even at early asymptomatic stages (15). The
relationship between hypometabolism seen in human tauopathies,
Tau aggregation, and its effect on neuronal activity is not well
established. Here, we show that moderate levels of aggregation-
prone Tau protein induces hypoactivity of neurons with a reduction
in neuronal ATP levels, loss of dendritic spines, and impaired
synaptic functioning. The neuronal activity and impaired pre-
synaptic compartment can be restored by application of the
adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline in vitro and in vivo,
suggesting that restoration of the diminished neuronal activity may
be a yet-unexplored treatment strategy to combat cognitive impair-
ment in tauopathies.
Results
High Aggregation Propensity Is Not Necessary for Tau Missorting but
Causes Tau to Accumulate in Axons as Grains. In organotypic hip-
pocampal slices, both proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau is
missorted to the somatodendritic compartment as has been shown
before (Fig. 1 A and B, asterisks) (5). This missorted Tau in trans-
genic slices consists of, at least partially, transgenic human Tau
(Fig. S1). Only proaggregant Tau transgenic slices reveal Tau-
positive beaded structures in the neuropil oriented mostly perpen-
dicular to the apical dendrites of the CA1 pyramidal cells (Fig. 1 C
and D, arrowheads) resembling grains in human AGD (16). This
suggests that proaggregant Tau accumulates in the axons as grains.
Transgenic proaggregant Tau is expressed at 83% of wild-type
Tau levels, whereas antiaggregant Tau is expressed at 50% of
wild-type Tau levels in 30 d in vitro (DIV30) organotypic slices (Fig.
1E), which is approximately threefold less as has been found in the
in vivo Tau transgenic mouse brain (6). The quantitative difference
between proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau could be partially
Significance
Tau-driven neurotoxicity occurs in multiple neurodegenerative
diseases that have a severe impact on families and the society at
large. However, its mode of toxicity is poorly understood, and
therefore no effective drug treatments have been discovered.
Here, we show that aggregate-prone Tau accumulates in axons
where it causes presynaptic dysfunction and matching neuronal
hypoactivity. The adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline, a
drug developed for patients with acute heart failure and renal
dysfunction, normalizes neuronal functioning in vitro and re-
stores cognition in Tau-transgenic mice. We hypothesize that
rolofylline could be used as a treatment by increasing bona fide
neuronal activity, which is diminished in tauopathy patients. In
turn, this should delay the onset or the progression of these
neurodegenerative diseases.

 explained by the fact that proaggregant Tau accumulates in the
neuropil as well, whereas antiaggregant Tau does not. To confirm
the axonal nature of the grains of Tau, we performed a biolistic
cotransfection of the red fluorescent protein TandemTomato (for
morphology) and proaggregant Tau (Fig. 1 F–I). Single neurons
are cotransfected, for example, in Fig. 1F, which shows a trans-
fected CA1 neuron or a dentate gyrus granule cell in Fig. 1H and
Fig. S2. The axons of transfected neurons (Fig. 1 G and I) clearly
reveal small inclusions of Tau (∼1 μm in size, arrowheads), al-
though presynaptic boutons (e.g., giant mossy fiber boutons) are
only marginally stained for Tau (Fig. 1I and Fig. S2 A and B;
arrow), indicating that Tau does not accumulate at presynaptic
boutons in these slices. Furthermore, we did not see colocalization
of the grains of Tau and presynaptic marker synaptophysin (Fig. S3).
We also observed that Tau missorts into a subgroup of proximal
dendrites, which correlates with a dramatic spine loss in the affected
dendrites (Fig. S2 C and F). By contrast, dendrites that do not
contain Tau are richly decorated with spines (>1 spines per μm),
indicating that there is only local impairment of dendritic function
in case of proaggregant Tau missorting.
Both Proaggregant and Antiaggregant Tau Are Phosphorylated, but
Only the Grains of Proaggregant Axonal Tau Appear in a Pathological
Conformation. The proaggregant transgenic mice have aberrantly
phosphorylated human Tau-ΔK280, although the relation be-
tween these posttranslational modifications and Tau toxicity is
poorly understood (6). Therefore, to differentiate between toxic
and nontoxic modifications of Tau, we compared the phosphory-
lation status of Tau in proaggregant (ΔK280) and antiaggregant
(ΔK280-PP) transgenic organotypic hippocampal slices (Fig. 2
and Table S1). Slices from both types of transgenic mice show the
12E8 epitope (pSer262/pSer356, Fig. 2 A and B) in the somato-
dendritic compartment (asterisks). Phosphorylation of these ser-
ines is known to induce detachment of Tau from microtubules and
to promote missorting of Tau (17). Indeed, the axonal grains of
Tau are not 12E8 positive (arrowheads), emphasizing that 12E8
staining is found only in mislocalized Tau. When corrected for the
difference in total Tau, 12E8 phosphorylation does not differ
between proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau (Fig. 2C). The PHF-1
epitope (pSer396+pSer404, Fig. 2 D–F) is seen in both types of
Tau transgenic slices where it appears in the somatodendritic
compartment (asterisks) and in the axonal grains (arrowheads).
PHF-1 phosphorylation levels are similar for antiaggregant or
proaggregant Tau when corrected for total Tau input (Fig. 2F).
The antibody AT180 (Tau pThr231) (18) shows (very) weak
staining in the cell soma of both types of Tau transgenic slices (Fig. 2

 G and H, asterisks) contrasting the high degree of Tau phos-
phorylated at Ser202/Thr205 [asterisks (somata) and long arrows
(apical dendrites)] (AT8 antibody, Fig. 2 I and J). We also
studied pathologically folded Tau using the MC-1 antibody
(Fig. 2K). MC-1–positive Tau accumulates in the axonal grains
of proaggregant Tau as described above (arrowheads), whereas
antiaggregant slices remain unstained. By contrast, Tau mis-
sorted in the somatodendritic compartment in either proag-
gregant or antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices is negative for
the MC-1 epitope (asterisks), consistent with the absence of
grains in dendrites. We also attempted to costain Tau (K9JA)
with dendritic marker MAP2. Although Tau frequently colo-
calized with MAP2 in dendrites (missorting), the grains never
colocalized with MAP2, emphasizing the axonal nature of the
grains (Fig. S4). Surprisingly, the axonal grains of Tau appear to
resist protein degradation because they are negative for markers of
degradation (vimentin, ubiquitin, Lamp1, Sqstm1/P62, Hsc70, and
Tia-1) (Fig. S5). Taken together, most phosphoepitopes are pre-
sent in both antiaggregant and proaggregant Tau transgenic
slices. Grains of pathologically folded Tau accumulate only in the
axons of proaggregant Tau transgenic neurons, which suggests
that these grains play a critical role in Tau-induced neuronal
dysfunction. However, these grains are not targeted for degrada-
tion, nor do they appear to induce an unfolded protein response
within the axon.
Proaggregant Tau Causes Spine Loss, Reduces Axonal Mitochondria, and
Lowers Cytoplasmic ATP. We labeled neurons of the organotypic
slices diolistically with DiI to investigate the effect of the proag-
gregant and antiaggregant Tau on spine density and morphology.
Proaggregant Tau transgenic slices showed a significant reduction
of spines compared with littermate control slices, whereas spine
density of antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices was similar to
controls (Fig. 3 A and B). Dendritic spines are usually classified
into different categories based on their shape, which represents
different functional properties (19). We could not detect a dif-
ference in classes of spines between slices of both transgenic lines
and littermate controls (Fig. 3C). We determined mitochondrial
movements in live organotypic slices because aggregation-prone
Tau is known to impair mitochondrial transport (Fig. 3 D and E).
Mitochondria transport is similar in both kinds of Tau transgenic
slices (Fig. 3E) with only a moderately lower mitochondrial density
in proaggregant Tau transgenic slices compared with antiaggregant
slices (Fig. 3F and Table S2). We also investigated the effect of
proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau on energy status (ATP level).
Transgenic slices were biolistically transfected with the FRET-
based ATP sensor (ATeam) (Fig. 3 G and H) (20). ATP is re-
duced in the proaggregant transgenic slices, matching the lower
mitochondrial density, compared with littermate controls or
antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices (Fig. 3H). This suggests that
the energy status of the neurons is compromised by proaggregant
but not by antiaggregant Tau.
The Proaggregant Tau-Induced Phenotype Can Be Rescued with the
Adenosine A1 Receptor Antagonist Rolofylline. The markers described
so far did not reveal any clear mode of action of toxic proaggregant
Tau despite the functional impairment reported previously in
transgenic mice (6). We therefore designed a quantitative PCR-
based miniscreen of key genes known to be (up-)regulated at
the mRNA level as a result of specific stressors serving as markers
for insults (Table S3). Surprisingly, expression of neuronal activity
marker cFos, astrocytic activity marker Gfap, and oxidative stress
marker Hmox1 were reduced in the proaggregant Tau transgenic
slices, whereas antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices were not dif-
ferent from littermate controls (Fig. 4A). Signs of molecular stress
(e.g., protein misfolding, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, etc.)
reflected by an increase in stress markers (Hspa1a, Osp94, Hmox1,
etc.), however, could not be found in the proaggregant Tau
transgenic slices. This confirms the lack of a classical cytotoxicity
by this species of aggregate-prone Tau (e.g., chaperones, aggre-
somes, stress granules, etc.), as has been reported above (Fig. S5).
Given that grains of Tau accumulate within axons (Fig. 1) and that
axonal mitochondria density is reduced (Fig. 3), we tested next
whether axonal (presynaptic) functioning is indeed impaired in
organotypic hippocampal slices. We therefore measured the paired-
pulse ratio (PPR) by applying a paired-pulse stimulus of the
Schaffer collaterals (Fig. 4 B and C). We observed a typical
paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) response in littermate controls
and antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices, whereas in proaggregant
Tau transgenic slices, the same stimulus paradigm resulted in a
paired-pulse depression (Fig. 4B). This indicates that proag-
gregant Tau induces presynaptic impairment, whereas presynapses
of antiaggregant Tau slices are unaffected. Adenosine down-
modulates neuronal activity (cFos levels), impairs the presynapse,
and attenuates long-term potentiation (LTP) via the A1 receptor
(21). Because this resembles our presynaptic phenotype (Fig. 4B)
and the outcome of the miniscreen, we attempted to counterbalance
the observed phenotype by using the adenosine A1 receptor antago-
nist rolofylline. An adenosine A2A receptor antagonist (ZM-241385),
an adenosine A1 receptor agonist (N6-cyclopentyladenosine), and a
Tau aggregation inhibitor (BSc3094) were used as controls (Table
S4) (22–24). Rolofylline increases neuronal activity (Fos mRNA)
both in proaggregant Tau transgenic slices and controls, although
in case of the proaggregant slices neuronal activity is almost
doubled, yielding levels similar to those of treated littermate
control slices (Fig. 4D). In line with these observations, the pre-
synaptic impairment in proaggregant Tau transgenic slices can be
reversed by rolofylline or BSc3094 without causing adverse effects
in controls (Fig. 4F and Fig. S6).

 Rolofylline Treatment Restores Dendritic Spine Levels in Proaggregant Tau
Transgenic Slices, Rescues Long-Term Memory Deficits, and Normalizes
Basal Synaptic Transmission in Proaggregant Tau Transgenic Mice.
Because the electrophysiological parameters in the proaggregant
Tau transgenic slices were normalized by rolofylline treatment, we
investigated whether it would also restore the level of dendritic
spines in these slices. Indeed, the reduced level of spines seen in
proaggregant Tau transgenic slices are normalized when treated
with rolofylline, whereas no significant changes are found in
antiaggregant Tau transgenic slices or littermate controls (Fig. 5 A
and B). The axonal density of mitochondria, which is slightly lower
in proaggregant compared with antiaggregant Tau transgenic sli-
ces, is marginally decreased by rolofylline treatment albeit in a
genotype-independent manner (Fig. S7). Having observed that
rolofylline restores presynaptic functioning (i.e., PPF, Fig. 4F),
neuronal activity (induction of Fos, Fig. 4D), and dendritic
spine levels in proaggregant Tau transgenic organotypic slices
(Fig. 5 A and B), we tested whether we could restore long-term
spatial memory in proaggregant Tau transgenic mice as well.
We therefore performed the Y-maze test, novel object recog-
nition test (NORT), and the fear conditioning test with 14-mo-
old proaggregant Tau transgenic and littermate control mice
within 10–20 d of oral rolofylline treatment. In the Y-maze test,
(treated) control mice spent more time in the novel arm, whereas
untreated proaggregant mice did not show any arm preference
(Fig. 5C). Rolofylline reestablished novel arm preference in
proaggregant mice, suggesting that rolofylline restores spatial
memory in these animals. In the NORT, (treated) control mice
explored the novel object more compared with the old object,
whereas the proaggregant mice did not show any preference for
the new or the old object (Fig. 5D). Rolofylline treatment im-
proved long-term object recognition memory in proaggregant
Tau transgenic mice, as shown by increased novel object pref-
erence. For fear conditioning testing, the effects of systemic
rolofylline administration on different stages of contextual and
clue-based (sound) fear learning were investigated 24 h after
the training session (Fig. 5 E and F). Contextual memory was
unaltered as all groups showed similar freezing when reintroduced
into the chamber. Control groups and the rolofylline-treated
proaggregant group showed a clue-induced freezing response,
whereas no effect was seen in the untreated proaggregant mice
(Fig. 5F). This result suggests an impaired learning association
between the sound and the foot shock in proaggregant mice, which
can be rescued by rolofylline treatment. Ten weeks of posttreat-
ment (starting at 14 mo), we assessed the electrophysiological
properties of the CA1 region of the hippocampus in treated
proaggregant Tau transgenic animals and controls (Fig. 5 G and
H). Compared with untreated proaggregant Tau transgenic
mice, treated mice (proaggregant Tau transgenics and littermate
controls) have significantly larger maximal excitatory postsynaptic
potential amplitudes (Fig. 5 G–I). The slope of the input/output
(I/O) curve is significantly reduced in proaggregant Tau transgenic
mice compared with controls, indicative of impaired basal synaptic
transmission (Fig. 5I). Treatment with rolofylline increases the slope
of the I/O curve in both proaggregant Tau transgenic slices and
littermate controls (Fig. 5I). The impairment of the presynapse, as
determined by application of a paired-pulse protocol is ambiguous
in the acute slices (Fig. S8A). However, at the shortest pulse interval
(20 ms), PPF is normally strongly suppressed by the feedforward in-
hibition (25). For the proaggregant Tau transgenic slices, feedforward
inhibition seems to be impaired because the PPR is as high as the
ratios seen with larger pulse intervals. Synaptic plasticity, measured as
the ability to elicit LTP by theta-burst stimulation, is not altered in any
condition compared with untreated littermate controls (Fig. S8B).
Discussion
In the present paper, we compared an aggregation-prone species
of Tau with its antiaggregant counterpart as well as nontransgenic
littermates. We used an organotypic hippocampal slice model to
show that both proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau is (hyper)
phosphorylated and mislocalized to the somatodendritic com-
partment in the absence of frank Tau aggregation. Although
missorting and/or hyperphosphorylation of Tau may be a pre-
requisite for Tau pathology to occur, we clearly show here that
it is not sufficient to cause neuronal dysfunction. This argues
that increased aggregation propensity (the only difference be-
tween proaggregant and antiaggregant Tau) is essential for Tau
toxicity. Despite of the high (>99.5%) homology of the two Tau
species, only proaggregant Tau accumulates as axonal spindle-
shaped grains in a pathological “pretangle” conformation, similar
to argyrophilic grains in humans. Proaggregant Tau, but not
antiaggregant Tau, decreases dendritic spine number and the ATP
levels in neurons, which further supports the role of aggregation
propensity as the mode of toxic action. Surprisingly, the axonal ag-
gregates of Tau do not colocalize with known aggregation markers.
Instead, presynapses are impaired in proaggregant Tau transgenic
slices, giving rise to a general reduction of neuronal activity, which
has been reported previously for Tau P301L-expressing mice as well
Fig. 4.
Organotypic slices expressing proaggregant Tau show reduced
neuronal and astrocytic activity and impaired axonal functioning. This can be
alleviated by antagonizing Tau aggregation propensity or stimulation of cell
activity with adenosine A1 receptor antagonist rolofylline. (A) The mRNA

 (15). The reduced ATP levels, dendritic spine loss, diminished
neuronal activity, and impaired presynaptic functioning are remi-
niscent of adenosine A1 receptor signaling. We therefore hy-
pothesized that inhibition of the adenosine A1 receptor signaling
may be able to restore neuronal functioning. Indeed, presynaptic
functioning, neuronal activity, as well as the reduction of dendritic
spines in the proaggregant Tau transgenic organotypic slices are
normalized by application of the highly selective adenosine A1
receptor antagonist rolofylline. When administrated orally to
proaggregant Tau transgenic mice, rolofylline restores cognitive
functioning and strengthens basal synaptic transmission, which is
known to be subdued as a result of adenosine signaling (26).
Adenosine, when bound to the A1 receptor, has an inhibitory
function on many organs including the brain where it reduces
neurotransmitter release (11). Adenosine is normally produced
both extracellularly and intracellularly where adenosine is formed
by degradation of AMP. Because intracellular ATP levels are 50
times higher than AMP levels, small changes in the ATP catabo-
lism lead to dramatic changes in AMP and subsequently adenosine
levels. The exact mechanism by which Tau is able to reduce pre-
synaptic functioning and subdue neuronal activity remains to be
determined. However, we see a reduction of ATP in proaggregant
Tau transgenic neurons, which may be caused by a release of ATP
from the neurons or a shift from ATP to AMP intraneuronally,
both leading to high extracellular adenosine levels (27). The role
for adenosine in the CNS is ambiguous. Adenosine is very im-
portant for the circadian rhythm and for neuroprotective effects
when bound to the adenosine A1 receptor (28). Concomitantly,
the impaired neurotransmitter release by adenosine A1 receptor
signaling blocks memory formation (29). So adenosine A1 signaling
seems to drive neuronal networks from the (highly) excitable state
to the rest and repair state, both of which are important for
maintaining synaptic functioning as well as learning and memory.
However, prolonged activation of the adenosine A1 receptor (due to
pathological Tau, Aβ, or other chronic stressors) may bring the
neurons in a permanent state of hypoexcitability impairing neuronal
functioning. In this study, we provide evidence that antagonizing the
adenosine A1 receptor can restore the Tau-induced neuronal dys-
function in a tauopathy mouse model. Rolofylline has never been
tested as a treatment for any human neurodegenerative disease. As a
diuretic, it failed in a phase III trial for patients suffering from acute
heart failure due to unimproved renal function. Adverse effects were,
however, limited (30). It has been reported that adenosine receptors
are increased in neurons in the degenerating human brain and that
administration of an adenosine A1 receptor agonist induces Aβ
production, Tau phosphorylation, and Tau missorting in vitro (31).
Down syndrome patients, known to suffer from early-onset AD, have
higher levels of adenosine than aged matched controls (32). How-
ever, due to the very short half-life of adenosine (<10 s in blood),
there have been no studies on adenosine levels in human brain
(33). Brain hypometabolism (i.e., neuronal hypoactivity), on the
other hand, is a characteristic hallmark during and preceding
neurodegeneration (34, 35). Cognitively normal ApoE4 homozy-
gous subjects show reduced glucose metabolism as is seen in AD
patients (36). The same reduction of glucose metabolism occurs in
preclinical individuals with a genetic predisposition for familial
AD, long before the onset of cognitive decline (37). Systemic
administration of GABAA agonists (benzodiazepines), which in-
hibit neuronal activity, almost double the risk for AD when taken
for more than 6 mo (38). On the other hand, the most common
psychoactive drug in the world (caffeine), an adenosine receptor
antagonist that boosts neuronal activity, protects against AD (39).
Stimulation of the perforant path in an Aβ-based mouse model is
sufficient to restore memory retrieval (40). Similarly, transcranial

NEUROSCIENCE
 magnetic stimulation in humans increases brain network activity and
performance of associative memory, emphasizing the benefit of in-
creased bona fide network activity (41). In conclusion, we show that
Tau protein impairs neurons through its ability to aggregate, which
in turn leads to reduced neuronal activity, lowered ATP levels, and
dendritic spine loss. In both the organotypic slice model as well as in
transgenic mice, one can alleviate the process of neuronal dysfunc-
tion by administration of the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist
rolofylline, a compound that is proven to be safe in humans. Since
neuronal hypoactivity/hypometabolism precedes human neurode-
generative diseases as well, restoration of normal neuronal activity
by rolofylline administration may prove to be a successful treatment
to counteract the Tau-induced brain dysfunction.
Materials and Methods
See SI Materials and Methods for detailed descriptions. All experiments were
approved by an animal welfare committee of the agency for Nature, Envi-
ronment, and Consumer Protection in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Slices were analyzed at DIV30 to DIV35. The localization of (phosphorylated)
Tau was examined by immunofluorescence in organotypic hippocampal slices.
Axonal localization of Tau, intraneuronal ATP levels, and mitochondrial motility
were studied by using biolistic transfection of organotypic hippocampal slices. The
mRNA quantification was performed by using real-time PCR. The synaptic
transmission was analyzed by assessing the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials
applied in a paired-pulse protocol. Dendritic spine levels in organotypic slices were
quantified by biolistic transfection of TandemTomato or diolistic labeling using
DiI. Organotypic proaggregant Tau transgenic mice and age-matched controls of
14 mo of age were used to test the effectiveness of rolofylline as a treatment for
Tau-induced dysfunction by oral administration. The behavioral performance of
mice treated with rolofylline was tested using the Y-maze, novel object recog-
nition task, and fear conditioning testing. The basic synaptic transmission in acute
slices was assessed by measuring the I/O responses of field excitatory postsynaptic
potentials. All results are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons
between two groups were tested using Student’s t test. Comparisons among
groups were tested using one-way or two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test or
Dunnett’s test for post hoc testing. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
