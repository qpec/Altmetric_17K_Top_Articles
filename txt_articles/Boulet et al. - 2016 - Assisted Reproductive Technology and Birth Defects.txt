IMPORTANCE Use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has been associated with
increased risks for birth defects. Variations in birth defect risks according to type of ART
procedure have been noted, but findings are inconsistent.
OBJECTIVES To examine the prevalence of birth defects among liveborn infants conceived
with and without ART and to evaluate risks associated with certain ART procedures among
ART-conceived infants.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Used linked ART surveillance, birth certificates, and
birth defects registry data for 3 states (Florida, Massachusetts, and Michigan). Methods for
ascertaining birth defect cases varied by state. Resident live births during 2000 to 2010
were included, and the analysis was conducted between Feburary 2015 and August 2015.
EXPOSURES Use of ART among all live births and use of certain ART procedures among
ART births.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Prevalence of selected chromosomal and nonchromosomal
birth defects that are usually diagnosed at or immediately after birth.
RESULTS Of the 4 618 076 liveborn infants between 2000 and 2010, 64 861 (1.4%) were
conceived using ART. Overall, the prevalence of 1 or more of the selected nonchromosomal
defects was 58.59 per 10 000 for ART infants (n = 389) vs 47.50 per 10 000 for non-ART
infants (n = 22 036). The association remained significant after adjusting for maternal
characteristics and year of birth (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.15-1.42). Similar
differences were observed for singleton ART births vs their non-ART counterparts (63.69 per
10 000 [n = 218] vs 47.17 per 10 000 [n = 21 251]; aRR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.21-1.59). Among
multiple births, the prevalence of rectal and large intestinal atresia/stenosis was higher for
ART births compared with non-ART births (aRR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.38-4.12). Among ART births
conceived after fresh embryo transfer, infants born to mothers with ovulation disorders had a
higher prevalence of nonchromosomal birth defects (aRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.13-2.06) than those
born to mothers without the diagnosis, and use of assisted hatching was associated with birth
defects among singleton births (aRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.10-2.19). Multiplicity-adjusted P values
for these associations were greater than .05.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Infants conceived after ART had a higher prevalence of
certain birth defects. Assisted hatching and diagnosis of ovulation disorder were marginally
associated with increased risks for nonchromosomal birth defects; however, these
associations may be caused by other underlying factors.

I
n2012,approximately1.5%ofliveborninfantsintheUnited
States were conceived using assisted reproductive tech-
nology (ART), defined as fertility treatments in which eggs
or embryos are handled outside the body.1 Since the birth
of the first ART-conceived infant in the United States in 1981,
ART use has increased rapidly; more than 157 000 cycles were
performed in 2012.2 Although ART is generally considered
safe, findings from registry-based cohort studies3-5 and
meta-analyses,6-8 primarily conducted in non-US popula-
tions, suggest that children conceived with ART have in-
creased risks for birth defects compared with their spontane-
ously conceived counterparts, particularly among singleton
infants.
Information on the degree to which certain ART proce-
dures influence the risk of birth defects is limited and often
inconclusive. Results from a 2012 cohort study3 indicated that
use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a procedure in
which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg, was as-
sociated with increased odds of birth defects relative to spon-
taneouslyconceivedpregnancies,whereasnoeffectwasnoted
for conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) without ICSI. How-
ever, pooled risk estimates for the association between birth
defects and conventional IVF vs those for the association be-
tween birth defects and ICSI have not been found to be mark-
edly different.6,7
Similarly,whileseveralstudiescomparingfreshandfrozen-
thawed embryo transfers identified similar risks for birth de-
fects regardless of embryo state,5,9-12 1 study found an in-
creased prevalence of birth defects for fresh but not frozen
embryo cycles when compared with spontaneously con-
ceived births.3 In addition, results from another study indi-
catedthattheoddsofblastogenesisdefectswere3timeshigher
for ART births after fresh embryo transfer vs non-ART con-
trols, while no effect was found for frozen-thawed embryo
transfers.13 There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the risk
of birth defects following the use of other ART procedures such
asassistedhatching14,15anddonoroocytes16orforembryostage
at transfer.17,18
Because both ART and birth defects are infrequent events,
sufficiently powered studies are needed to evaluate associa-
tions,particularlywithregardtospecificARTprocedures.Thus,
the aim of our study was to use population-based data from
3 US states to assess the prevalence of birth defects among
liveborn infants conceived using ART compared with their
non-ART counterparts and to examine the risk of birth de-
fects associated with different types of ART procedures among
ART-conceived infants.
Methods
We used data from the States Monitoring ART (SMART) Col-
laborative, a consortium of participating states and the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Reproduc-
tiveHealththatpromotesstate-basedsurveillanceandresearch
on the maternal and child health outcomes of ART.19 We used
linked ART surveillance, birth certificates, and birth defects
registry data for Florida, Massachusetts, and Michigan from
2000 to 2010. These states linked their birth defects registry
information with birth certificate data and provided deiden-
tified linked data sets to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Then, data from the Centers for Disease Control
andPrevention’
sNationalARTSurveillanceSystemwerelinked
with the state vital records information using a probabilistic
method. Maternal and infant date of birth, plurality, mater-
nalresidencezipcode,andgravidity(livebirthorderpluspreg-
nancy losses) were primary linkage variables.20 Ancillary in-
formation such as maternal race/ethnicity, infant sex, and
infant birth weight were used to resolve duplicate links. The
overall linkage rate was 90.5%.
We included all resident live births in Florida, Massachu-
setts, and Michigan between 2000 and 2010; ART births were
those that were successfully linked with the National ART Sur-
veillance System. We excluded births with missing informa-
tiononpluralityandARTbirthsusingmethodsotherthantran-
scervical IVF such as gamete intrafallopian transfer and zygote
intrafallopian transfer (<1% for all states). The unit of analysis
was a liveborn infant. The study was approved by the institu-
tional review boards at the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, Florida Department of Health, Massachusetts Depart-
ment of Health, and Michigan Department of Health and
Human Services. Informed consent was waived because the
research involved no more than minimal risk, the rights and
welfare of the subjects were not adversely affected, and the
research could not practicably be carried out without such a
waiver.
The methods for ascertaining birth defect cases varied by
state. The Florida Birth Defects Registry uses passive case-
finding methods and ascertains birth defects diagnosed in live-
born infants before 1 year of age. Records are identified from
hospital discharge abstracts, the state regional perinatal cen-
ter database, and the state Children’
s Medical Services rec-
ords and are linked to birth certificates. The Massachusetts
Birth Defects Monitoring Program uses active case finding
whereby birth hospitals and pediatric care facilities submit dis-
charge records with a birth defect diagnosis. Inclusion critera
are being a liveborn infant or a fetal death of more than 20
weeks’gestation or weighing more than 350 g, having a struc-
tural defect that meets the diagnostic criteria and was diag-
nosedbefore1yearofage,andbeingborntomotherswhowere

Key Points
Question Is assisted reproductive technology associated with an
increased risk of birth defects?
Findings In this cohort study of more than 4 million liveborn
infants in 3 states, the prevalence of nonchromosomal birth
defects among singleton infants was higher for those conceived
using assisted reproductive technology compared with
non–assisted reproductive technology singletons. This difference
was significant after controlling for maternal characteristics.
Meaning Infants conceived after assisted reproductive
technology had a higher prevalence of certain birth defects;
however, this association could be owing to underlying subfertility.

Defects Registry uses passive case ascertainment based on re-
porting from hospitals, cytogenetic laboratories, and pediat-
ric genetics clinics. Reporting is required for liveborn infants
diagnosed with a reportable condition before the second birth-
day and for fetal deaths after 20 weeks’gestation or more or
after they reach 400 g or higher. Michigan data are aug-
mentedbyinformationfromChildren’
sSpecialHealthCareSer-
vices enrollments; confirmed cases are identified as a result
ofnewbornmetabolic,hearing,orgeneticscreeningandlinked
birth and death record information.
Because of differences in case ascertainment across states,
we evaluated a limited number of birth defects. We selected
defects that were used in previously published national
estimates21,22 because they are usually diagnosed at or imme-
diatelyafterbirthandarelikelytobeconsistentlycollectedand
reported across different surveillance systems. The nonchro-
mosomal birth defects assessed in this study were spina bi-
fida with or without anencephaly, encephalocele, anophthal-
mia and microphthalmia, common truncus, transposition of
great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot, atrioventricular septal de-
fects,hypoplasticleftheartsyndrome,cleftpalatewithoutcleft
lip, cleft lip with and without cleft palate, esophageal atresia/
tracheoesophageal fistula, rectal and large intestinal atresia/
stenosis, reduction defects of the upper limbs, reduction de-
fects of the lower limbs, gastroschisis, omphalocele, and
diaphragmatic hernia. The chromosomal defects were tri-
somy 13, trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), and trisomy 18.
We examined the distribution of sociodemographic fac-
tors for all ART and non-ART liveborn infants. The variables
were derived from the birth certificate and included mater-
nalstateofresidence,age,race/ethnicity,education,parity(de-
rived from live birth order), tobacco use during pregnancy, dia-
betes (chronic or gestational), hypertension (chronic or
pregnancy-induced), infant plurality, sex of the infant, birth
weight, and gestational age. We also compared the preva-
lence of birth defects for all ART and non-ART births and strati-
fiedbysingletonandmultiplebirths.Forallcomparisons,chro-
mosomal defects were stratified by maternal age younger than
35 years and 35 years and older because of known age effects.23
The prevalence of specific birth defects was reported if the de-
fect was diagnosed in 20 or more infants.
Next, we restricted the study population to ART-
conceived infants and evaluated the prevalence of 1 or more
nonchromosomal birth defects for certain ART procedures in-
cluding cycle type (fresh nondonor, fresh donor, frozen-
thawed nondonor, or frozen-thawed donor embryos), num-
ber of embryos transferred, use of assisted hatching (the
purposeful disruption of an embryo’
s zona pellucida by laser,
mechanical,orchemicalmeans),andinfertilitydiagnosis(tubal
factor, ovulation disorder, diminished ovarian reserve, endo-
metriosis, male factor, or unexplained infertility). Because in-
formation on use of ICSI and day of embryo transfer was only
available for fresh embryo cycles, we further restricted the
study population to infants resulting from fresh embryo trans-
fer and examined the prevalence of birth defects for all afore-
mentionedproceduresandICSIwithmalefactorinfertility,ICSI
withoutmalefactorinfertility,anddayofembryotransfer(days
2-3 vs days 5-6). We conducted the analyses for all live births

and singleton live births; small numbers precluded evalua-
tion of multiple live births.
We used 2-tailed Satterthwaite-adjusted χ2 tests to assess
differences in the distribution of sociodemographic charac-
teristics for ART vs non-ART liveborn infants. We used multi-
variable predicted marginal proportions from logistic regres-
sion models to compute adjusted risk ratios for the association
between use of ART and birth defects. The models were ad-
justedformaternalage,race/ethnicity,education,parity,smok-
ing during pregnancy, diabetes, hypertension, state of resi-
dence, and year of birth. We also used predicted marginal
proportions to calculate adjusted risk ratios for the associa-
tion between use of specified ART procedures and nonchro-
mosomal birth defects. Models for births resulting from fresh
andfrozen-thawedembryotransfersincludedcycletype,num-
ber of embryos transferred, use of assisted hatching, and in-
fertility diagnosis. Models for births resulting from fresh em-
bryo transfers included type of ART (conventional IVF vs ICSI
with and without male factor infertility), cycle type, number
of embryos transferred, day of transfer, use of assisted hatch-
ing, and infertility diagnosis. Because information on mater-
nal body mass index was not available for Massachusetts dur-
ing the study period and was only available from autumn 2007
onward for Michigan and March 2004 onward for Florida, we
were unable to evaluate this factor as a potential confounder.
We applied the Holm-Bonferroni method to the primary and
subgroup analyses to account for multiple comparisons and
report multiplicity-adjusted P values. P values less than .05
were considered significant.
Allanalysesaccountedforclusteringofinfantswithinalive
birth delivery and clustering of sibling births. We used SAS ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS Institute) and SUDAAN version 11.0 (RTI Inter-
national) for analysis. Cohort sizes of less than 20 infants were
suppressed and complementary suppression was applied.
Results
Between 2000 and 2010, there were 4 618 076 liveborn in-
fants in Florida, Massachusetts, and Michigan; of those in-
fants, 64 861 (1.4%) were conceived using ART. Compared with
non-ART infants, those conceived using ART had higher fre-
quencies of multiple births, a birth weight of less than 2500 g
and less than 1500 g, and gestational age of less than 37 weeks
and less than 32 weeks (Table 1). There was no difference in

of ART-conceived infants were born to mothers who were Mas-
sachusettsresidents,comparedwith18.7%(n = 853 165)ofnon-
ART infants. Mothers of ART infants were more likely to be 30
years or older, non-Hispanic white, college graduates, and nul-
liparous than mothers of non-ART infants. Tobacco use dur-
ing pregnancy was less common in mothers of ART vs non-

ARTbirthsvsnon-ARTbirths.Forwomenyoungerthan35years,
the prevalence of Down syndrome was higher for ART vs non-
ARTbirths(aRR,1.63;95%CI,1.05-2.54),buttheassociationwas
not significant after accounting for multiple comparisons (P =
.18). For women 35 years and older, the prevalence of chromo-
somaldefectswaslowerforARTbirthsthannon-ARTbirths(aRR,
0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.88). With the exception of increased risk
forrectalandlargeintestinalatresia/stenosis(aRR,2.39;95%CI,
1.38-4.12), no significant associations with ART were observed
for multiple births.
When the study population was restricted to ART births
conceived by fresh or frozen embryo transfer, no significant
associationsbetweenARTproceduresandriskof1ormorenon-
chromosomal birth defects were detected (Table 4). After fur-
ther restriction to ART births conceived by fresh embryo trans-
fer, diagnosis of ovulation disorder was marginally associated
with nonchromosomal defects among all live births (aRR, 1.53;
95% CI, 1.13-2.06; P = .05) (Table 5). The prevalence of non-
chromosomaldefectswasalsoincreasedforalllivebirths(aRR,
1.32; 95% CI, 1.02-1.71) and singleton live births where as-
sisted hatching was used (aRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.10-2.19); how-
ever, the multiplicity-adjusted P values were >.05.
Discussion
UsingdatafromanationalARTsurveillancesystemlinkedwith
vital records and information from 3 state-based birth de-
fects registries, we found that ART use was associated with an
increased risk for certain birth defects. These findings con-
firm previous reports based on smaller populations3-5 and pro-
vide additional information on variations in risk according to
the type of ART procedure used. While we did not find con-
siderable differences in risk by procedure type, the preva-
lence of nonchromosomal defects was higher for ART births
where assisted hatching was used compared with ART births
without the technique; however, the association was not sta-
tistically significant after accounting for multiple compari-
sons. Two studies that assessed the risk of birth defects fol-

lowing assisted hatching did not detect an effect14,15; however,
such an association is plausible because the procedure could
damage the embryo and is often used for patients with a poor
prognosis who may have other risks for adverse birth
outcomes.24 In addition, we observed a marginally increased
prevalence of nonchromosomal defects among births to
women with an ovulation disorder, a finding that may be as-
sociated with high rates of obesity, a known risk factor for birth
defects,25 among women with polycystic ovary syndrome.26
While we adjusted for diabetes in our models, it is possible that
undiagnosed diabetes among obese women with polycystic
ovary syndrome may partially explain this association.
Overall, the prevalence of the selected birth defects in our
study population is consistent with national estimates.22 How-
ever, because we used a limited group of conditions, our preva-
lence estimates of 1% are lower than national estimates for all
typesofbirthdefects(approximately3%).27Inaccordancewith
otherstudies,3-5,7,28-32wefoundthattheriskofbirthdefectsfol-

Theprimarystrengthofourstudyistheuseofalargepopu-
lation- and registry-based cohort with accurate information on
ART procedures. To our knowledge, this is the largest US study
of birth defects and ART to date. Furthermore, we limited our
analysistobirthdefectsthatareapparentatbirthandthuslikely
to be reliably ascertained across different states. However, our
findings have several limitations. First, we did not have infor-
mation on the occurrence of birth defects among fetal deaths
or pregnancy terminations. As such, our prevalence estimates
almost certainly understate the true prevalence of the birth de-
fects included in our study. This may also result in risk ratios
that are biased toward or away from the null,39 depending on
theextenttowhichmothersofARTinfantsaremoreorlesslikely
than mothers of non-ART infants to have a miscarriage or ter-
minate a pregnancy affected by birth defects. It is also possible
that differences in case ascertainment across states influenced
thecombinedprevalenceestimates.Assistedreproductivetech-
nology–conceivedinfantsmaybemonitoredmoreclosely,thus
resulting in increased detection of birth defects in those in-
fants compared with the general population. Because of varia-
tions among states in the collection of information on mater-
nalbodymassindex,wewereunabletocontrolforthispotential
confounder.Finally,someofthebirthcertificatevariablesused
in the adjustment are under-reported and may be differen-
tially reported among ART and non-ART groups.
Conclusions
We found that ART use conferred an increased risk for non-
chromosomalbirthdefects,particularlythoseaffectingthegas-
trointestinal and musculoskeletal systems; however, we were
unable to evaluate the potential effect of underlying subfer-
tility on this association. Among ART births, no single proce-
dure was found to substantially increase risk, although use of
assisted hatching and diagnosis of ovulation disorders were as-
sociated with marginal increases in the prevalence of birth de-
fects.Intotal,thesefindingssuggestthatfactorsrelatedtosub-
fertility may explain the association between use of ART and
birth defects, although additional studies on specific ART pro-
cedures are needed. As use of ART continues to increase, care-
ful evaluation of the long-term outcomes of children con-
ceived using these technologies becomes increasingly
important. These findings provide additional information on
risks of ART that can be used when counselling patients.
