among the study population was 49%, which is signifi-
cantly higher than the general population (<1%).
Conclusions Our results suggest that the healthy eating 
community on Instagram has a high prevalence of ortho-
rexia symptoms, with higher Instagram use being linked to 
increased symptoms. These findings highlight the implica-
tions social media can have on psychological wellbeing, 
and the influence social media ‘celebrities’ may have over 
hundreds of thousands of individuals. These results may 
also have clinical implications for eating disorder develop-
ment and recovery.

Introduction
Social media use is constantly increasing, with now 90% 
of UK young adults (aged 16–34 years) accessing social 
media platforms [1]. As such it is important to better under-
stand the effects that social media use may have on mental 
wellbeing. One example is the social media based healthy 
eating community, which has recently grown in popularity 
[2]. While overall this movement has been positive, with 
members striving to eat more fruits and vegetables and 
fewer processed foods, there is a growing concern around 
it triggering negative behaviours and eating disorders [3]. 
One eating disorder of interest in this context is orthorexia 
nervosa (ON), an obsession with eating healthily [4]. Pre-
vious work around similar disorders suggests that social 
media use may contribute to an ‘echo-chamber’ effect, 
where users perceive their values and world-views to be 
more common than they actually are, due to selectively 
viewing contributions of other, similarly minded people 
Abstract 
Purpose Social media use is ever increasing amongst 
young adults and has previously been shown to have nega-
tive effects on body image, depression, social comparison, 
and disordered eating. One eating disorder of interest in 
this context is orthorexia nervosa, an obsession with eat-
ing healthily. High orthorexia nervosa prevalence has been 
found in populations who take an active interest in their 
health and body and is frequently comorbid with anorexia 
nervosa. Here, we investigate links between social media 
use, in particularly Instagram and orthorexia nervosa 
symptoms.
Methods We conducted an online survey of social 
media users (N = 680) following health food accounts. 
We assessed their social media use, eating behaviours, 
and orthorexia nervosa symptoms using the ORTO-15 
inventory.
Results Higher Instagram use was associated with a 
greater tendency towards orthorexia nervosa, with no other 
social media channel having this effect. In exploratory 
analyses Twitter showed a small positive association with 
orthorexia symptoms. BMI and age had no association with 
orthorexia nervosa. The prevalence of orthorexia nervosa

[5]. In light of this effect, here we investigated whether 
time spent on social media is associated with symptoms of 
ON. We focus on Instagram, as it is most prevalent in the 
healthy-eating movement [3] but also assess other social 
media channels in an exploratory analysis.
Instagram, launched in 2010, is an online social net-
working service that is currently used by 53% of Ameri-
can young adults (aged 18–29 years) with internet access 
[6]. The platform enables users to post pictures and videos 
to their profiles, add a caption, use hashtags (# symbol) 
to describe the photos, and tag other users (@ symbol). 
Users can follow any number of accounts and view a steady 
stream of content posted by the users they follow where 
they can “like” or “comment” on posts. Instagram suggests 
new accounts to follow based on the content that the user is 
already exposed to. Posts are dominated by the content of 
the images rather than any captions or comments. In June 
2016 Instagram had 500 million registered users worldwide 
[7], making it the third biggest social media platform after 
Facebook and Tumblr. A US poll showed the average user 
spends 21.2 min on Instagram each day, with the 18–29 age 
group spending the most time at 30 min [8].
The hashtag #food is one of the top 25 most popular 
hashtags on Instagram.1 A more detailed analysis of Insta-
gram photo content found it to be one of eight popular cat-
egories along with self-portraits (or “selfies”), friends, 
activities, captioned photos, gadgets, fashion, and pets [9], 
suggesting the importance of Instagram for the sharing of 
food-related content. Healthy food posts tend to receive 
more support from users than less healthy images [10], 
indicating a positive attitude towards healthy foods and 
healthy eating. Research also suggests that social media is 
used to inform actual food choices, with 54% of consumers 
using social media to discover and share food experiences, 
and 42% using social media to seek advice about food [11]. 
Documentation, surveillance, and creativity have all been 
identified as motivations for Instagram use [12, 13], which 
corresponds well with the sharing of food images—both as 
a food diary (documentation/creativity) and searching for 
recipes and inspiration (surveillance).
Instagram and social media more broadly have been 
associated with mental health problems. For example, 
social media use has been associated with higher lev-
els of depression in young adults [14], as well as eat-
ing disorders and related behaviours [15]. For example, 
adolescents who view health and fitness-related content 
on social media are more likely to have an eating disor-
der [15]. In patients with AN, extensive Facebook use 
is associated with greater levels of symptoms [16], and 
viewing pro-anorexia websites worsened psychological

symptoms in an experimental study when compared to 
control participants who viewed neutral websites [17]. 
More frequent Instagram use has been directly associ-
ated with greater levels of depressive symptoms, and fol-
lowing a greater number of strangers is associated with 
greater levels of negative social comparison [18]. An 
analysis of the #fitspiration tag on Instagram, a tag used 
to denote images intended to inspire people to become fit 
and healthy, found that the majority of images of women 
showed a thin and toned body type with objectifying ele-
ments, which could have negative effects on body image 
and self-esteem [19]. Moreover, researchers have pointed 
out the key role of social comparison in body image dis-
turbance [20]. However, image-based platforms such as 
Instagram have also been shown to confer a significant 
decrease in self-reported loneliness to users, whereas 
text-based platforms such as Twitter do not [21]. Taken 
together, while there is some evidence for negative links 
between social media use and mental health, the picture 
is far from clear and social media may indeed also have 
positive or protective qualities in certain circumstances.
Recently there has been much media coverage on the 
role of social media, particularly Instagram, in the ‘healthy 
eating movement’ in the UK [2, 22], despite a lack of cur-
rent academic literature on the subject. Pioneers of this 
movement have a powerful social media presence, particu-
larly on Instagram, reaching and influencing hundreds of 
thousands of people, despite often having no formal train-
ing in health sciences or nutrition. Because Instagram is 
an image-based platform, users may be more likely to fol-
low advice or imitate the diets of Instagram ‘celebrities’ as 
they feel a more personal connection than they would on 
a text-based platform. Although often not based on scien-
tific evidence, individuals are encouraged to cut out vari-
ous food groups from their diets, potentially leading to an 
unbalanced diet and deficiencies. Moreover, this advice 
may encourage psychological problems around food, and in 
some cases, lead to eating disorders such as anorexia ner-
vosa (AN) [3] or ON.
Orthorexia nervosa is defined as an unhealthy obses-
sion with eating healthy food. The term is derived from 
the Greek “orthos,” meaning “correct”, and was coined 
by Steven Bratman [4]. Despite not appearing in the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 
[23], ON has sparked a body of research. The proposed 
diagnostic criteria for ON [24] include obsessive focus on 
healthy eating, food anxiety, and dietary restrictions, with 
these behaviours causing clinical impairments. There is 
some overlap between ON, AN and obsessive compulsive 
disorder (OCD) [25]. Both AN and ON share traits of per-
fectionism, cognitive rigidity, and guilt over food transgres-
sions, while OCD and ON share intrusive thoughts and 
ritualised food preparation. However, while AN patients are 
 279

preoccupied with the quantity of food, ON patients are pre-
occupied with the quality of food.
Orthorexia symptoms are associated with healthy life-
style choices such as eating more fruit and vegetables, eat-
ing less white cereals, shopping in health food stores, exer-
cise, and reduced alcohol consumption [26]. But ON is also 
associated with significant dietary restrictions, malnutri-
tion, and social isolation [27], although there is no appar-
ent association with BMI [26, 28]. Currently the ORTO-15 
questionnaire [29] is used to determine the presence of ON. 
Higher prevalence has been found in yoga instructors [30], 
dieticians, [31], nutrition students [32], and exercise sci-
ence students [33] compared to the general population. The 
prevalence of ON in the general population was recently 
estimated to be less than 1% [34].
There are several reasons as to why ON does not cur-
rently appear in the DSM. For example, Varga et al. point 
out that there are psychometric limitations to the ORTO-
15 questionnaire, such as issues with internal consistency, 
lack of standardisation, and cultural variation [24, 26, 35]. 
Furthermore, the high cut-off score may lead to false posi-
tives [36], arguably rendering the questionnaire unsuitable 
as a diagnostic tool. In addition, questions have been raised 
as to whether ON can simply be described as a subtype of 
another disorder, such as AN, OCD, or Avoidant/Restric-
tive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) [37]. However, Dunn 
and Bratman [24] make a compelling argument that there 
is sufficient evidence to suggest ON is a distinct condition.
Currently the relationship between ON and social media 
use is unclear, although links between social media use and 
AN have been reported. Taken together, the reported nega-
tive effects of social media on psychological wellbeing, the 
role of Instagram in food sharing and negative social com-
parison, and the popularity of the healthy eating movement 
on Instagram suggests that there may be a positive relation-
ship between ON and use of social media, and that Insta-
gram may play a key role in the development and mainte-
nance of disordered eating patterns. Accordingly, here we 
assess whether there is a link between Instagram use and 
symptoms of ON.
Methods and materials
Participants
Participants were recruited via not-paid-for advertisements 
on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, as well as the blog 
“Plantbased Pixie”2 and the “Heath Bloggers Community”

social-media/.
newsletter. Data were collected from 713 participants (23 
males, 686 females, 4 other/prefer not to say. Mean age 
24.96 ± 8.17 years). Non-female participants (N = 27) and 
participants for whom an ORTO-15 score could not be cal-
culated due to missing data (N = 6) were excluded from the 
main analysis. We decided to concentrate on female partici-
pants as the N recruited for men was too low to provide 
adequate power for statistical analyses.
The final sample thus consisted of 680 females, age 
18–75 years (mean = 24.70 ± 7.87) with an average healthy 
BMI (mean = 22.14 ± 3.89). 44.6% of participants lived in 
UK, 26.7% in the US, with the remainder living in an addi-
tional 40 countries. All participants gave their informed 
consent before starting the questionnaire and the study was 
approved by the UCL ethics committee.
Survey
Our online survey was developed using Qualtrics (http://
www.qualtrics.com). The questions we asked are detailed 
in the following.
Social media use
Participants were asked “Which social media channels do 
you use?” and could select multiple responses out of: Insta-
gram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, Tumblr, and 
LinkedIn. These are all content-based social media chan-
nels which have a ‘newsfeed’, and where other users can be 
added/followed. While Instagram and Pinterest are mainly 
image-based, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn 
focus on text entries, with Tumblr having elements of 
both. Next, participants were asked about the amount of 
time spent on each channel they use: (1) “How often do 
you access [channel]?” with multiple-choice answers of 
“Less than once per month, 1–3 times per month, once a 
week, 2–3 times per week, 4–5 times per week, once a day, 
several times per day”, and (2) “On a typical day where 
you access [channel], how much time do you spend on it 
in total?” with multiple-choice answers of “Less than 15, 
15–30, 31–60, 60+ min”. In addition, participants who 
indicated using Instagram were asked to rank-order Hu 
et al. [9] eight popular content types for the frequency with 
which they typically appear on their feed.
Dietary choices
Participants were asked which of 19 food types they 
included in their diet: red meat, white meat, processed 
meat, fish, dairy products, eggs, fruit, vegetables, whole-
grains, refined grains, refined sugars, wheat, gluten, salt, 
oils, beans and pulses, processed/prepared foods, alcohol, 
and nightshades. Participants were also asked which label 
 280

best described their diet: omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, pes-
catarian, paleo, plant-based, high-carb low-fat, raw vegan, 
other.
Orthorexia nervosa measure
The ORTO-15 questionnaire [29] was used to assess for 
orthorexic symptoms. ORTO-15 is a multiple-choice ques-
tionnaire consisting of 15 items with 4-point Likert-scale 
response options. A score of 1 is assigned to behaviours 
that most reflect orthorexic symptoms, with a score of 4 
assigned to the most normal behaviours, meaning lower 
scores indicate higher levels of ON symptoms.
Demographics
Participants were asked their age (years), sex (male, female, 
other/prefer not to say), ethnicity, country of residence, 
height (cm or feet/inches), and weight (kg or lbs).
Assessment and analysis
An ORTO-15 score was calculated for each participant. We 
used two cut-off scores due to disagreement in the literature 
over the appropriate cut-off point: less than 40 (following 
[28]), and less than 35 (following [35]). Participants’ social 
media time was converted into a score of approximate min-
utes per week spent on each channel (following [38]).
Height was converted to meters and weight to kg to cal-
culate BMI. Only a small percentage of data was missing 
(3.82%), most of which was height and weight data.
Analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel 2016 and 
SPSS Version 24. Because data on social media use was 
non-parametric, Spearman’s rank order correlations were 
used to determine relationships between ORTO-15 score 
and social media use. Data on ORTO-15 scores was nor-
mally distributed, therefore, Pearson product-moment cor-
relations were used to determine relationships between 
ORTO-15 scores and the variables age and BMI. Post-hoc 
analysis used Spearman’s rank order correlations to deter-
mine the relationship between ORTO-15 scores and both 
number of food types and number of social media channels.

ranked food as 1st or 2nd most frequent image category 
appearing on their Instagram feed.
28.4% of participants reported following a vegan diet, 
24.7% an omnivorous diet, and the remainder either a veg-
etarian, pescatarian, paleo, plant-based, high-carb low fat, 
raw vegan, or other diet. The mean number of food types 
eaten was 11.88 ± 3.67 of a possible 19.
The prevalence of ON in our sample was 90.6% with a 
cut-off score of <40, or 49.0% with a cut-off score of <35. 
This did not change amongst the sub-sample of Instagram 
users (N = 669; 90.4% <40, or 49.3% <35).
Inferential Results
No relationship was found between ORTO-15 scores and 
number of food types eaten (r = −0.01; p = 0.87), num-
ber of social media channels used (r < 0.01; p = 0.99), age 
(r = −0.06; p = 0.13), or BMI (r = −0.03; p = 0.47). There 
were also no significant differences in ORTO-15 score 
between diet types as determined by one-way ANOVA 
[F(5,674) = 0.705, p = 0.620]. We, therefore, did not control 
for these variables in our correlational analyses.
As predicted, there was a negative correlation between 
ORTO-15 score and Instagram use (r = −0.10; p = 0.01) 
(Fig. 1). No significant relationship was found between 
ORTO-15 score and other social media use (Table 3), 
except Twitter which showed a small positive correlation 
(r = 0.12, p = 0.04).
To assess the robustness of the correlation between 
ORTO-15 and Instagram use when controlling for poten-
tially confounding demographic variables, we addition-
ally conducted linear regression analysis with ORTO-15 
score as the outcome measure and Instagram use, age, 
BMI, ethnicity (dummy coded as white/non-white), and 
country of residence (dummy coded as UK/non-UK) as 
the predictor variables. The overall model was signifi-
cant [F(5,648) = 9.58, p < 0.001)] with Instagram use (β 
= −0.12, p = 0.003) and country of residence (β = 0.23, 
p < 0.001) being significant predictors. The remaining vari-
ables were not significant (all p > 0.22).
Discussion
This study investigated the relationship between social 
media use and ON. We found a significant relationship 
between symptoms of ON as measured by the ORTO-15 
test and Instagram use, with higher Instagram use being 
associated with a greater tendency towards ON. No other 
social media channels were found to have this effect, 
although Twitter seemed to have a small protective associa-
tion. While the effect size was small, the large population 
of social media users, now over 500 million on Instagram 
alone, means that this is a meaningful effect at population 
level.
There are several factors that likely contribute to the 
association between Instagram use and ON symptoms:

First, the image-focused nature of Instagram, which plays 
to the picture-superiority effect—whereby images are more 
likely to be remembered than words [39]—and makes Ins-
tagram ideal for sharing food images. Second, social media 
allows for and encourages selective exposure, as users 
choose which accounts they wish to follow, and so are then 
continually exposed to the type of content these accounts 
produce. This limited exposure in turn may lead to users 
believing a behaviour is more prevalent or normal than is 
actually the case, and may lead to perceived social pres-
sures to conform to such behaviours. Moreover, problem-
atic behaviours may be continuously reinforced through 
image exposure and personal interactions on the platform. 
Third, there is likely a prevalence of eminence-based prac-
tice by which users with a large following may be perceived 
as authorities, allowing healthy eating ‘celebrities’ to influ-
ence large numbers of individuals by giving their followers 
a constant and curated feed of images portraying a certain 
diet or behaviour. Overall, these factors may explain why 
Instagram, an image-based social media, has been the plat-
form of choice for the healthy eating community [3].
Although only Instagram was predicted to have an asso-
ciation with ON, exploratory analysis into other social 
media channels showed that Twitter had a positive associa-
tion with ON symptoms. While purely exploratory, this is 
an interesting result that future work should seek to repli-
cate. If correct, we speculate that this effect may be linked 
to the text-focused and strictly character-limited nature of 
twitter, which does not compliment a food-focused commu-
nity as well as an image-based platform such as Instagram.
We believe this is the first study investigating a link 
between social media and ON, and it contributes to the 
growing body of literature on ON and its causes. The 
high prevalence of ON in the current study population is 
reflected in previous studies, where higher prevalence was 
found in yoga instructors (86%) [30], dieticians (41.9%) 
[31], nutrition students (35.9%) [32], exercise science stu-
dents (84.5%) [33], and patients recovering from AN or 
bulimia nervosa (58%) [40] compared to the general popu-
lation (<1%) [29, 34]. These are all populations who take 
an active interest in their health and body, in the same way 
that the healthy eating community on Instagram might be. 
When using the higher cut-off <40, the prevalence of ON 
in the current study population was higher than any other 
previously studied population, and occurred despite par-
ticipants spending no more time on Instagram per day, on 
average, than the general population (15–30 vs. 21.2 min 
[8]). Even when using the lower cut-off <35, which may be 
more specific, the prevalence was still considerably higher 
than the general population. It is possible that we tapped 
a sub-group of Instagram users who are using it predomi-
nantly for food-related enquiries and who prescribe to the 
‘healthy eating movement’.
The relationship between Instagram use and ON symp-
toms reported here has potential clinical implications, as 
there are overlaps between ON and AN [25], and ON has 
been found to be a frequent comorbidity with both AN 
and bulimia nervosa [40]. In fact, ON symptoms have 
been found to worsen following treatment for other eating 
disorders, suggesting that ON may be a compromise by 
which patients continue to exercise control over food and 
their body, although to a lesser degree than in AN. This 
is consistent with the finding that ON and BMI are not 
related [26, 28]. A lack of relationship between ON and 
type of diet further suggests that orthorexic behaviour is 
not limited to eliminating specific food groups.
Limitations and further research
Participants were recruited through convenient non-
random sampling, with the majority coming from the 
author’s Instagram account (83%), which is not represent-
ative of the general population. In addition, the research 
title (Health habits on social media) may have attracted 
individuals with an interest in health. Furthermore, BMI 
was calculated from self-report rather than measured, 
accordingly, we cannot rule out error and deliberate miss-
reporting. Finally, we did not assess whether some par-
ticipants followed a strict diet for medical reasons. While 
this is unlikely to affect the overall results, its omission 
may have introduced unnecessary noise.
Because a large proportion of our study sample used 
more than one social media channel, we cannot exclude 
the possibility of interactions between these channels. 
While this was not the focus of the current study, consid-
ering over half of online-active adults use more than one 
social media channel [6], such interactions may present 
an interesting avenue for future research. Future research 
may wish to further address these open questions. In the 
current study, we cannot establish a causal relationship 
between Instagram use and ON symptoms due to the cor-
relational nature of our study, and future research may 
wish to assess possible causal link between these vari-
ables as well as possibly test intervention strategies for 
alleviating negative effects of Instagram use.
Conclusion
The current findings suggest that within the study popula-
tion, higher Instagram use was associated with stronger 
orthorexic symptoms. No other social media channel had 
this effect, although Twitter had a small positive associa-
tion. Age, BMI, number of social media channels, and

type of diet had no effect on orthorexia nervosa symp-
toms. Overall, these findings provide an initial indica-
tion of the role that modern social media may play in the 
onset and progression of eating disorders.
