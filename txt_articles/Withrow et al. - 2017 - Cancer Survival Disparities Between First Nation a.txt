Abstract
Background: The burden of cancer among indigenous people
in Canada has been understudied due to a lack of ethnic identifiers
in cancer registries. We compared cancer survival among First
Nations to that among non-Aboriginal adults in Canada in the
first national study of its kind to date.
Methods: A population-based cohort of approximately 2
million respondents to the 1991 Canadian Long Form Census
was followed for cancer diagnoses and deaths using probabi-
listic linkage to cancer and death registries until 2009. Excess
mortality rate ratios (EMRR) and 5-year age-standardized rel-
ative survival rates were calculated for 15 cancers using age, sex,
ethnicity, and calendar-time–specific life tables derived from
the cohort at large.
Results: First Nations diagnosed with cancers of the colon and
rectum, lung and bronchus, breast, prostate, oral cavity and
pharynx, cervix, ovary, or with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and
leukemia all had significantly poorer 5-year survival than
their non-Aboriginal peers. For colorectal cancer, a significant
disparity was only present between 2001 and 2009 (EMRR: 1.52;
95% CI, 1.28–1.80). For prostate cancer, a significant disparity
was only present between 1992 and 2000 (EMRR: 2.76; 95% CI,
1.81–4.21). Adjusting for income and rurality had little impact on
the EMRRs.
Conclusions: Compared with non-Aboriginals, First Nations
people had poorer survival for 14 of 15 of the most common
cancers, and disparities could not be explained by income and
rurality.
Impact: The results of this study can serve as a benchmark
for monitoring progress toward narrowing the gap in survival.

Introduction
People indigenous to Canada are recognized by the Constitu-
tion as "Aboriginal" and comprise three groups: First Nations,
M�
etis, and Inuit (1). As of 2011, the 1.4 million people belonging
to these groups accounted for just over 4% of Canada's popula-
tion. The First Nations are the largest of the groups and number
approximately 850,000 (2).
Adult life expectancy for First Nations is significantly lower than
the national average, and cancer is among the leading causes of
death. (3, 4). Despite the presence of a comprehensive system of
population-based cancer registries in Canada, however, cancer
patterns for First Nations and indigenous people more generally
have been understudied because, like most administrative health
data systems in Canada, cancer registries do not routinely collect
information about the ethnicity of cases.
Of the three most common metrics of cancer burden (inci-
dence, survival, mortality), information about survival is par-
ticularly sparse. Provincial studies of cancer survival among
First Nations have been limited by small numbers of any
particular cancer. Canadian indigenous populations are accord-
ingly lacking an up-to-date perspective on cancer survival.
These knowledge and data gaps are barriers to progress, plan-
ning, and monitoring of needed cancer control programs tai-
lored to these populations (5–9).
In this article, we describe the results of a study conducted using
linkage of four national administrative databases to estimate
cancer survival in First Nation people Canada-wide from 1992
to 2009. We compare their survival to the survival of non-
Aboriginal people and consider the extent to which differences
in income and rurality explain the differences in survival between
these populations. The study is large, inclusive, and methodo-
logically rigorous and will contribute to a better understanding
of the cancer burden in these populations and how to reduce it.
Materials and Methods
Data sources and study population
The 1991 Census Mortality Cohort is the largest population-
based cohort in Canada (10, 11). The cohort has been described in
detail elsewhere and has since been updated to include longer
follow-up (10–12). In brief, individuals were eligible for the
cohort if they were aged 25 years and older on June 4, 1991
(Census day), enumerated by the 1991 Long Form Census of the
Population and matched to a 1990 and/or 1991 tax filing using
standard probabilistic techniques. In the general population,
the long form version of the census was distributed to 1 in 5

 households. On participating First Nation reserves, in many
northern and remote communities, and in non-institutional
collective dwellings (e.g., hotels, school dormitories), however,
all residents were administered the long form.
On the basis of these criteria, approximately 2.7 million indi-
viduals were eligible to be linked to the Canadian Cancer Registry
(1992-2009), the Canadian Mortality Database (1992–2009)
and tax summary files including name changes, deaths, and
updated postal codes up until 2009 (11, 12). Because of incom-
patibilities between cancer registration in Quebec and the rest
of Canada, residents of Quebec were excluded from the cohort
for this study, as they have been from other national-level survival
analyses (13–15). This reduced the cohort to approximately
2 million persons.
Respondents were categorized as First Nation if they met any of
the following criteria: (i) reported registration under the Indian
Act (the principal statute through which the federal government
administers Indian status, local First Nations governments, and
the management of reserve land and communal monies); (ii)
reported membership in a First Nation band, or (iii) reported
North American Indian (First Nation) as their singular ancestry.
Respondents were categorized as non-Aboriginal if they (i) were
not First Nation according to the above definitions; (ii) did not
report M�
etis as one of two or fewer ancestries, and (iii) did not
report Inuit ancestry only.
First and higher order invasive cancers were eligible for inclu-
sion in the survival analyses if they were diagnosed between
January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2009, in cohort members
aged 45 to 90 years at diagnosis. This age range was chosen
because background mortality rates could be more precisely
estimated (see "Statistical analysis" section below). Cases that
were registered based on death certificate only, autopsy only, or
had negative survival time were excluded. Multiple cancers in the
same individual were counted according to the International
Agency for Research on Cancer multiple primary rules (16).
Cancers were grouped according to the SEER Site Recode for
ICD-O-3 (17).
Area-level income adequacy quintiles were constructed by
Statistics Canada based on all responses to the Long Form Census.
Income adequacy is based on a ratio of total income from all
sources combined across all members of an economic family unit
to low-income cutoffs from the 1991 Census Dictionary. Quin-
tiles of income adequacy were constructed within each census
metropolitan area, census agglomeration, or rural and small town
area to take account of regional differences in housing costs that
are not reflected in low-income cutoffs (18). Rurality was a
dichotomous variable defined by Statistics Canada and deter-
mined at the census subdivision level.
Statistical analysis
We measured net survival using relative survival methods.
Advantages of relative survival over more commonly used
cause-specific approaches are that information about the cause
of death is not required and that by using this method, one
measures the excess mortality associated with the cancer irrespec-
tive of whether the death was directly or indirectly attributable to
cancer (19, 20).
Relative survival has rarely been used to measure or compare
survival in indigenous populations because indigenous-specific
life tables (tables of expected survival) are not available or are
suspected to suffer from numerator–denominator bias (21–23).
Using information from the cohort at large (not restricted to
cancer cases), however, we were able to construct ethnicity, age,
sex, and calendar-time–specific life tables that were not subject to
numerator–denominator bias.
Life tables were constructed using flexible parametric models
implemented with the stpm2 command in Stata version 13
(StataCorp LP; refs. 24, 25). Given the relatively large amount
of random variation in the observed mortality rates at either end
of the age spectrum for First Nations, we restricted our life tables
to ages 45 to 90 years. Within this age range, mortality rates
were more precise and therefore deviation of the models from
empirical rates could be identified and model fit improved.
To produce the excess mortality rate ratios for First Nations we
used flexible parametric survival models fitted on the log cumu-
lative hazard scale. In the first model (Model A), First Nation
ethnicity, age, sex, and decade of diagnosis (1992–2000 vs. 2001–
2009) were included as main effects. In Model B, income quintile
and rurality were included in the model. We tested all covariates
for time-varying effects, where the primary time scale was time
since diagnosis. For each cancer, the best fit model and the
number of knots for the restricted cubic splines, were determined
on the basis of a combination of Akaike's Information Criterion
(AIC), Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), log likelihood ratio
tests, and subjective judgment of graphical displays since simple
use of AIC and BIC can occasionally lead to over-fitting (24).
To generate 5-year survival estimates, we produced a marginal
estimate of survival for each age group based on the best-fit model
and
applied
standardization
weights.
The
standardization
weights are those described by Corazziari and colleagues (26).
Five-year survival estimates were restricted to cancers diagnosed in
the 2001–2009 time period because while excess mortality rate
ratios tended not to change significantly over time, survival
improves over time. During the later time period, there were a
sufficient number of cases in First Nations to produce estimates of
survival that conformed to Statistics Canada data release guide-
lines for most cancers.
Results
The 1991 Canadian Census Mortality Study followed 2.7
million adults for incident cancers from January 1, 1992 until
death or the end of the study period, December 31, 2009. After
excluding residents of Quebec, nearly 2 million persons were
included in the cohort, of whom 54 605 were categorized as
First Nations (Table 1). Just over 55% of the First Nations
cohort was female. Women made up more than half of all
Status First Nation long form respondents and the gender
imbalance was further exaggerated by a greater success rate of
linkage to 1990 and 1991 tax filings among First Nation women
than among men (4).
Non-Aboriginal members of the cohort were more affluent
than the population of Canada at large, which is evident based on
the unequal distribution of non-Aboriginal cohort members
across the five income quintiles. First Nation people were more
likely than non-Aboriginal people to fall within the lowest
income quintile, to be young, and to live in a rural area. Nearly
two thirds of First Nation people included in the cohort lived on
reserve at census enumeration and over 90% were registered
under the Indian Act (data not shown).
A total of 237 905 cancers occurred among non-Aboriginal (n ¼
234 035) and First Nation (n ¼ 3 870) cohort members during the

 study period. We excluded 1.3% of non-Aboriginal and 1.9% of
First Nation cancer cases based on registration by death certifi-
cate or autopsy only or negative survival time. After restricting to
the 15 most common cancers among First Nations, a total of
187,475 cases among non-Aboriginals and 3,290 cases among
First Nations contributed to our analyses.
After taking into account differences in age, time period, and sex
(Model A), First Nation adults appeared to have poorer survival
than non-Aboriginals from all cancers except for multiple myelo-
ma, indicated by EMRRs that exceed 1 (Tables 2 and 3). Sex did not
act as effect modifier of the association between ethnicity and
survival and accordingly, the reported EMRRs are not sex-specific.
For colorectal and prostate cancers, the survival disparities associ-
ated with being First Nation varied by time period. For colorectal
cancer, a significant disparity in survival was only present in the
later time period (2001–2009, EMRR: 1.52; 95% CI, 1.28–1.80).
For prostate cancer, a disparity in survival was only present in the
earlier time period (1992–2000, EMRR: 2.76; 95% CI, 1.81–4.21).
For non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the EMRR associated with being
First Nations varied over time since diagnosis. Within the first
year, First Nations had an EMRR of 1.78 (95% CI, 1.18–2.69);
however, by 5 years post-diagnosis, there was no excess risk
associated with being a First Nation person (Table 3). Apart from
the exceptional cases listed above, EMRRs for cancers with a
significant association between being First Nations and survival
ranged from 1.25 (95% CI, 1.14–1.37) for lung and bronchial
cancers to 1.90 (95% CI, 1.52–2.39) for breast cancer.
Adjusting for income and rurality (Model B) tended to dampen
the association between First Nation ethnicity and survival. For
most cancers, the rate ratio reduced by between 15% and 20%
after taking income and rurality into account.
Sex- and ethnicity-specific 5-year age-standardized relative sur-
vival rates for cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2009 are
presented in Table 4. The largest absolute differences in survival
rates between First Nations and non-Aboriginals were for cervical
and ovarian cancers, where 5-year relative survival was at least 20
percentage points higher among non-Aboriginals. For colorectal
cancer, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia,
deficits in survival for First Nations were between 10 and 20
percentage points.

 Discussion
For all 15 cancers examined, First Nation adults had equal or
poorer cancer survival than their non-Aboriginal peers. The largest
relative differences in survival were for prostate and breast cancers.
Controlling for income and rurality explained little of the dis-
parities between the populations. In this section, we place
our results in the context of other studies of indigenous cancer
survival, consider reasons for the disparities we have reported, and
highlight strengths and limitations that should be considered
while interpreting the results.
We are aware of two contemporaneous studies in Canada
measuring differences in cancer survival between First Nation
people and their non-Aboriginal peers. A small study of 19 oral
cavity squamous cell carcinomas diagnosed among First Nations
in Alberta between 1998 and 2009 found that First Nations had
significantly poorer survival than their non-First Nation peers
(27). A much larger study included just fewer than 4,000 cancers
diagnosed in First Nations between 1968 and 2001 in Ontario. It
found significantly poorer survival among First Nation people for
colorectal, breast, prostate, cervical, and lung cancers (the lung
cancer disparity was only significant in males; ref. 28). The
findings of both these studies are consistent with what we found
Canada-wide, with the exception of the lung cancer disparity,
which in the current study was consistent across sexes.
Reasons for the disparities reported here are multifactorial and
originate at the tumor, patient, and health care system levels. At
the tumor level, differences in stage, tumor size, anatomic site,
grade, and hormonal status may all contribute to differences in
survival (29). These are mediators of disparity to the extent that
differences in these factors may represent differential exposures
and/or access to timely diagnosis.
Stage at diagnosis has been cited as one of the most
important explanatory factors for ethnic disparities in cancer
survival (30–32). Studies of stage distribution among Aborig-
inal people in Canada are limited and have shown mixed
results. In Manitoba, First Nation ethnicity was not associated
with stage at colorectal cancer diagnosis (33). In studies from
Manitoba and Ontario, however, First Nation women were
more likely than non-First Nations to be diagnosed with breast
cancer at a later stage (33, 34) In Ontario, differences in
survival between First Nations and non-First Nations were
only present among women diagnosed with stage I breast
cancer (35). Internationally, stage has only been found to
account for a portion of the survival disparity between indig-
enous and no indigenous persons, and stage-specific ethnic
disparities persist (36–38).
At the patient level, psychosocial factors including social sup-
port, stigma, and the associated delay in seeking care have been
shown to be associated with socioeconomic disparities in cancer
survival (29), but the effects of these on survival disparities have
not to our knowledge been quantified for indigenous populations
(39, 40).
The prevalence of comorbidities, quality of nutrition, and other
aspects of general health (smoking, physical activity etc.) are other

 patient level factors that are likely to mediate the association
between ethnicity and survival. Comorbidities may prevent
patients from being candidates for certain treatment modalities
or make them less able to withstand treatment that is received.
Comorbidities have been found to explain indigenous disparities
in survival at least as much as treatment (34, 35, 41, 42).
Health care system–level factors include treatment and
screening. Treatment-related disparities in survival between
indigenous and non-indigenous people have been reported in
the United States, Australia, and New Zealand (38, 41–47).
These studies have reported that indigenous patients are less
likely to undergo definitive surgery, and in some cases radio-
therapy and chemotherapy (36, 37, 41, 42, 47, 48). Some of
these differences in treatment have been attributed to poor
communication between service providers and indigenous
patients (49). Among Ontario breast cancer patients, however,
the proportion of patients receiving appropriate treatment for
age and stage did not differ between First Nations and non-
Aboriginals (34, 35).
Surveys and linkage studies measuring the uptake of breast,
cervical, and colorectal cancer screening among First Nations have
had mixed findings (50–54). Screening could result in true
differences in survival but may also exaggerate differences in
survival between two populations with different screening uptake
as a result of lead-time. In recent decades, prostate cancer was
often diagnosed through prostate-specific antigen (PSA) "screen-
ing" and resulted in the detection of cancers that may never
have presented symptomatically. From 1991 to 2001, mortality
from prostate cancer among Registered First Nations within this
cohort was comparable with that in the general population
despite the much poorer survival, suggesting that overdetection
of latent disease through higher uptake of PSA tests among
non-Aboriginals could explain, at least in part, the exceptionally
large survival disparity (4, 55, 56).
Increasing the uptake of screening among First Nations to meet
guideline levels may improve survival and decrease cancer mor-
tality for screen-detectable cancers. Detection of other cancers,
however, will often occur through primary health care encounters
and subsequent referral to specialized services (57). Each step
along this cancer care continuum is an opportunity for inequal-
ities in survival to be initiated or widened.
In summary, the disparities in cancer survival measured in this
study are likely a result of differences in tumor, patient, and health
care–level factors occurring across the cancer continuum. Evi-
dence from international literature suggests that screening, stage
at diagnosis, the prevalence of comorbidities, and differential
treatment are interrelated and important contributors to the
disparity.
Strengths and limitations
This study makes a novel contribution to the literature. It is the
first multi-province/territory study to estimate cancer survival
among First Nations in Canada. The census-based cohort was
sufficiently large and had sufficient follow-up to report cancer
survival for 15 different cancers among First Nations, making it
the first time cancer survival has been estimated among First
Nations for nine of these cancers.
We took advantage of the population-based cohort to pro-
duce life tables specific to the First Nations using the same
identifiers that identified First Nation cancer cases, thereby avoid-
ing numerator-denominator bias (21, 22). This is the first North
American study we are aware in over 30 years to have estimated
relative survival for an indigenous-population with indigenous-
specific life tables. Using these life tables allows us to take dif-
ferences in background mortality into account.
Having the census as the foundation of the study has other
advantages. We were able to consider the role of rurality and
individual-level income on the disparities in survival that we
measured. Further, using the census allowed us to identify First
Nations according to self-report. This is preferable to ethnic
identifiers derived from the medical record that have been shown
in the United States to markedly underestimate the number of
American Indians and Alaskan Natives (58–62). Self-report tends
also to be superior to geographic identifiers, which suffer from a
trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, either by restricting
the scope to people who live in areas densely populated with
Aboriginal people (i.e., reserves) or by using a broader definition
and including non-Aboriginal cases (63).
Some potential limitations to generalizability should be dis-
cussed. First, inconsistencies in registration methods between
Quebec and the other Canadian provinces and territories neces-
sitated the exclusion of Quebec from our analyses. As a result,
findings from this work may not be generalizable to the
Quebec population. Quebec is Canada's second largest prov-
ince and home to just under 10% of the national First Nation
population (2).
The representativeness of the cohort at large to the population
of Canada has been discussed elsewhere and is overall considered
to be good. The cohort does have an over-representation of people
who are married, of higher income and/or education (10, 11).
Because relative survival was used, however, and the expected
mortality came from the same population from which the cancer
cases were drawn, we do not expect the EMRRs from the cohort to
vary significantly from those that would have been estimated
based on the population at large. The mortality of cohort mem-
bers is very similar to that of the Canadian Population as a whole
(12).
Demographically, Registered First Nations who were eligible
for the cohort (i.e., responders to the census) did not differ from
those finally included in the cohort. Registered First Nations living
in communities of less than 10,000 people, however, are over-
represented in the cohort compared with their true share of the
population because all residents of participating reserves and
remote communities were administered the long-form census,
rather than the one in five households that were administered the
long form elsewhere (64). In exploratory analyses stratified by
residence on reserve, EMRRs were similar for First Nations living
on- and off-reserve suggesting that this over-representation had
little impact on the results overall. There were too few cases to
formally assess and report differences in survival and survival
disparities between those residing on- and off-reserve and this is a
limitation of the work.
With respect to completeness of the source files, we believe
the Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR) to have high case ascertain-
ment since each province and territory has a mandated responsi-
bility for collection and reporting of cancers. Death ascertainment
in the Canadian Mortality Database is, according to Statistics
Canada, "virtually complete" with very few exceptions (65). By
also including deaths reported in tax filings and in the Canadian
Cancer Registry, death ascertainment is even higher.
With respect to the linkage, based on comparable cancer
incidence patterns in the cohort at large to the general Canadian

 population, linkage to the CCR appears to have been successful.
Given that there are no gold standard incidence rates for First
Nations, it is impossible to determine whether this was differen-
tial by ethnicity (12). If linkage to cancer records was differential
by ethnicity, however, bias would only arise if linkage was also
associated with cancer survival and we see no mechanism through
which such a bias could arise.
As mentioned earlier, an important limitation is that while the
registries currently collect information on stage at diagnosis, a key
prognostic indicator, this was not the case in all provinces his-
torically and accordingly, we were unable to explore the role of
stage in the survival disparities we observed.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated that the survival rates for the majority
of cancers studied were worse for First Nation adults compared
with their non-Aboriginal peers. Just as determinants of survival
disparities exist at the tumor, patient, and health care levels, so
must the interventions to reduce them. Across this spectrum, data
and evidence for how disparities in cancer survival between First
Nation and non-Aboriginal persons in Canada are initiated and
sustained are sparse. Going forward research and surveillance
activities that will help elucidate the best path to a reduced cancer
burden are needed.
In the face of cancer incidence rates among First Nations that are
rising more steeply than the general population, improving
survival to match that in the general population is necessary to
reduce the burden of cancer in these populations (33, 66). The
findings presented here serve as a benchmark for monitoring
progress toward that end.
