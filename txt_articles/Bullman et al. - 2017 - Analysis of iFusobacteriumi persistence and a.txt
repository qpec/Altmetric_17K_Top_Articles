Colorectal cancers comprise a complex mixture of malignant cells, nontransformed cells,
and microorganisms. Fusobacterium nucleatum is among the most prevalent bacterial
species in colorectal cancer tissues. Here we show that colonization of human colorectal
cancers with Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome—including Bacteroides,
Selenomonas, and Prevotella species—is maintained in distal metastases, demonstrating
microbiome stability between paired primary and metastatic tumors. In situ hybridization
analysis revealed that Fusobacterium is predominantly associated with cancer cells in
the metastatic lesions. Mouse xenografts of human primary colorectal adenocarcinomas
were found to retain viable Fusobacterium and its associated microbiome through successive
passages. Treatment of mice bearing a colon cancer xenograft with the antibiotic
metronidazole reduced Fusobacterium load, cancer cell proliferation, and overall tumor
growth.These observations argue for further investigation of antimicrobial interventions as
a potential treatment for patients with Fusobacterium-associated colorectal cancer.
T
he cancer-associated microbiota are known
to influence cancer development and pro-
gression, most notably for colorectal can-
cer (1–5). Unbiased genomic analyses have
revealed an enrichment of Fusobacterium
nucleatum in human colon cancers and adeno-
mas relative to noncancerous colon tissues (6, 7).
These observations have been confirmed in studies
of multiple colon cancer patient cohorts from
around the world (8–12). Increased tumor levels
of F. nucleatum have been correlated with lower
T cell infiltration (13); with advanced disease stage
and poorer patient survival (10, 11, 14); and with
clinical and molecular characteristics such as
right-sided anatomic location, BRAF mutation,
and hypermutation with microsatellite instability
(9, 12, 15).
Studies in diverse experimental models have
suggested a pro-tumorigenic role for Fusobacterium.
Feeding mice with Fusobacterium (16–18), infection
of colorectal cancer cell lines with Fusobacterium
(19–21), and generation of xenografts derived from
Fusobacterium-infected colorectal cancer cell
lines (17) were all observed to potentiate tumor
cell growth. Suggested mechanisms have ranged
from enhanced tumor cell adhesion and invasion
(17, 19, 22) to modulation of the host immune
response (16, 23) to activation of the Toll-like
receptor 4 pathway (17, 20, 21). However, not all
animal or cellular studies of Fusobacterium have
demonstrated a cancer-promoting effect (24). A
recent editorial has highlighted the importance
of studying Fusobacterium infection in colon can-
cer as a component of the diverse microbiota with-
in the native tumor microenvironment (25).
To investigate the role of Fusobacterium and
its associated microbiota in native human colo-
rectal cancers, we analyzed five independent co-
horts of patient-derived colorectal cancers for
Fusobacterium and microbiome RNA and/or
DNA. Where technically possible, we performed
Fusobacterium culture and tested the effect of
antibiotic treatment upon the growth of propa-
gated patient-derived colon cancer xenografts.
These cohorts (table S1) include: (i) 11 fresh-
frozen primary colorectal cancers and paired
liver metastases (frozen paired cohort); (ii) 77
fresh-frozen primary colorectal cancers with de-
tailed recurrence information (frozen primary
cohort); (iii) published data from 430 resected
fresh-frozen colon carcinomas from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (26) (TCGA cohort), together with
data from 201 resected fresh-frozen hepatocellular
carcinomas from TCGA (27); (iv) 101 formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded colorectal carcinomas
and paired liver metastases (FFPE paired cohort);
and (v) 13 fresh primary colorectal cancers used
for patient-derived xenograft studies (xenograft
cohort).
Using the frozen paired cohort, we tested
whether we could culture viable Fusobacterium
species from primary colorectal carcinomas and
corresponding liver metastases. Quantitative poly-
merase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed
that 9 of 11 (82%) snap-frozen primary tumors
(table S2) were positive for Fusobacterium in the
primary tumor [patients one through nine (P1
through P9)]; we could isolate Fusobacterium spe-
cies from 73% of these tumors (n = 8 of 11 tumors;
P1 through P8) (Fig. 1A). In addition, we cultured
Fusobacterium species from two liver metastases
(P1 and P2) from Fusobacterium-positive primary
tumors. Five metastatic specimens had inadequate
amounts of tissue for culture but were positive
for Fusobacterium by qPCR (P3 through P7), for
a total of seven primary-metastatic tumor pairs
(64%) testing positive for Fusobacterium by qPCR
(Fig. 1A). This finding extends previous results
showing the presence of Fusobacterium nucleic
acids in hepatic and lymph node metastases of
colon cancer (7, 22, 28) to now demonstrate that
viable Fusobacterium species are present in dis-
tant metastases.
To address whether the same Fusobacterium
is present in primary cancers and metastases,
we performed whole-genome sequencing of pure
Fusobacterium isolates from primary and meta-
static tumors from two patients (P1 and P2). For
both patients, the primary-metastatic tumor pairs
harbored highly similar strains of Fusobacterium,
with >99.9% average nucleotide identity, despite
the tissue being collected months (P2) or even
years (P1) apart (Fig. 1B and fig. S1). We cultured
Fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. funduliforme
from the primary colorectal tumor and liver meta-
stasis of P1 and F. nucleatum subsp. animalis from
the primary tumor and metastasis of P2. We also
cultured other anaerobes, including Bacteroides
species, from the primary-metastasis pairs (table S3).
Our finding of nearly identical, viable Fusobacterium
strains in matched primary and metastatic colo-
rectal cancers confirms the persistence of viable
Fusobacterium species through the metastatic pro-
cess and suggests that Fusobacterium species
may migrate with the colorectal cancer cells to
the metastatic site.
To quantitate the relative abundance of Fuso-
bacterium and to evaluate the overall microbiome
in the paired primary and metastatic tumors,
we performed RNA sequencing of 10 primary
cancers and their matched liver metastases from
the frozen paired cohort (P1 to P6 and P8 to P11).
PathSeq analysis (29) of the RNA sequencing
data showed that the same Fusobacterium spe-
cies were present, at a similar relative abundance,
in the paired primary-metastatic tumors (Fig. 1C,
samples P1 to P6) and that the overall dominant
microbiome was also qualitatively similar. In ad-
dition to F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum,
primary cancer microbes that persisted in the
liver metastases included Bacteroides fragilis,
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and several typically
oral anaerobes such as Prevotella intermedia and
Selenomonas sputigena (Fig. 1C). In contrast, there

 tumors, (ii) the relative abundance of Fusobacte-
rium is correlated between primary tumors and
metastases, and (iii) the dominant microbial
genera in the liver metastases correspond to those
in the primary tumors, demonstrating micro-
biome stability between paired Fusobacterium-
positive primary-metastatic tumors (P = 0.01)
(fig. S3).
To investigate the relationship between
Fusobacterium and cancer recurrence, we per-
formed microbial culture and bacterial 16S rRNA
gene sequencing in a blinded fashion on the fro-
zen primary cohort of 77 snap-frozen colorectal
cancers lacking paired metastases (n = 21 with
recurrence, n = 56 without recurrence) (table S4).
We discovered that 44 of 77 tumors (57%) had
cultivable Fusobacterium species and 45 of 77
had >1% Fusobacterium relative abundance.
We found no correlation between Fusobacterium
load or culture with either recurrence or stable
disease in this cohort (fig. S4).
To assess Fusobacterium persistence and its
correlation with clinical parameters, we ana-
lyzed the 101 primary-metastasis pairs from the
FFPE paired cohort (table S5). We found that
43% (n = 44 of 101) of primary colorectal cancers
tested positive for Fusobacterium by qPCR and
45% (n = 20 of 44) of liver metastases arising
from these primary tumors were Fusobacterium-
positive (fig. S5A).
To determine the spatial distribution of
Fusobacterium in these tumors, Fusobacterium
RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis was per-
formed on five qPCR-positive primary-metastasis
pairs from this cohort (table S6, Fig. 2, and fig.
S6). Both biofilm and invasive F. nucleatum were
observed in primary colorectal cancer (Fig. 2,
A to D). Invasive F. nucleatum distribution was
highly heterogeneous and focal, found in isolated
or small groups of cells with morphology consist-
ent with that of malignant cells and located close
to the lumen and ulcerated regions. F. nucleatum
was also observed in glandular structures present
in the tumor center and invasive margins, but to
a lesser extent. In adjacent normal mucosa (when
present), F. nucleatum was exclusively located in
the biofilm. In liver metastasis, F. nucleatum was
predominantly localized in isolated cells whose
histomorphology is consistent with colon cancer
cells (Fig. 2, E to H), although occasional stro-
mal F. nucleatum could be observed as well. No
F. nucleatum was detected in the adjacent residual
liver parenchyma.
Notably, none of the 57 Fusobacterium-negative
primary colorectal tumors were associated with a
Fusobacterium-positive liver metastasis (n = 0 of
57; P = 0) (fig. S5A). Consistent with previous re-
ports (15), the presence of Fusobacterium in paired
primary tumors and corresponding metastases
was enriched in metastatic cancers of the cecum
and ascending colon (n = 10 of 20 Fusobacterium-
positive primary-metastasis pairs, P = 0.002),
(fig. S5B), whereas cancers that were Fusobacterium-
negative in both primary and metastatic lesions
were more likely to be rectal cancers (n = 29 of 57
of the Fusobacterium-negative primary-metastasis
pairs, P = 0.016) (fig. S5B).
To assess the relationship between patient
survival and Fusobacterium presence in the pri-
mary cecum and ascending colon, we carried out
PathSeq (29) analysis on RNA sequencing data
from the 430 primary colon adenocarcinomas in
the TCGA cohort. Patients with cancer of the ce-
cum and ascending colon exhibited worse overall
survival than patients with non-cecum ascend-
ing colon cancer (P = 0.01) (fig. S5C). Among
patients with cecum and ascending colon tumors,
we observed poorer overall survival in correla-
tion with tumor Fusobacterium load (fig. S5D)
(P = 0.004).
To determine whether Fusobacterium is associ-
ated with primary liver hepatocellular carcinoma,
we performed PathSeq analysis (29) of RNA se-
quencing data from 201 primary liver tumors from
the TCGA cohort. This analysis demonstrated that
Fusobacterium is rare in primary liver carcinomas
and that the relative abundance of Fusobacterium
is significantly enriched in liver metastases arising
from colorectal cancers compared with primary
liver cancers (P = 0.008) (Fig. 1E).
PathSeq analysis of data from the TCGA co-
hort also confirmed that the microbes present in
liver metastases of Fusobacterium-positive colo-
rectal carcinomas are similar to those associated
with Fusobacterium in primary colorectal carci-
noma. Selenomonas, Bacteroides, and Prevotella

 genera were shared between primary and meta-
static colorectal cancers and also correlated with
Fusobacterium abundance in primary colon ade-
nocarcinoma (Fig. 1F, fig. S7, and table S7).
Given that metastatic colorectal carcinomas
harbored cultivable Fusobacterium species, we
wondered whether viable Fusobacterium could
persist in xenografts from human colorectal can-
cers, which would provide a valuable model system
for evaluating the effects of microbiota modulation
on cancer growth. In a double-blinded approach,
13 fresh human primary colorectal tumors from
the xenograft cohort were evaluated, by culture
or qPCR, for the presence of Fusobacterium. In
parallel, these tumors were implanted subcutane-
ously, by an independent investigator, into Nu/Nu
mice to establish patient-derived xenografts (PDXs)
(table S8). All five Fusobacterium–culture positive
tumors resulted in successful xenografts (fig. S8),
one of four qPCR-positive but culture-negative
tumors gave rise to a successful xenograft, and
none of the four Fusobacterium-negative tumors
generated successful xenografts (P = 0.003). Tu-
mor grade did not appear to significantly influ-
ence successful xenograft formation (P = 0.1)
(fig. S9A), although we noted a modest associa-
tion between Fusobacterium cultivability and high-
grade tumors in this cohort (n = 4 of 5 tumors, P =
0.03) (fig. S9B).
Next, we sought to determine whether
Fusobacterium species would remain viable and
stably associated with a xenograft. A PDX derived
from an F. nucleatum culture–positive colon can-
cer (COCA36) was passaged to xenograft genera-
tion F8 over 29 weeks and tested for F. nucleatum.
We cultured F. nucleatum from this PDX for up to
four generations and 124 days in vivo. Allxenograft
generations, from F1 through F8, were positive
for Fusobacterium by qPCR (Fig. 3A). Additional-
ly, we cultured other anaerobic bacteria, including
B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron, from both the
primary tumor and PDXs. We further cultured
Fusobacterium species from PDXs generated
from two additional patient tumors (table S9).
qPCR and microbiome analysis of fecal pellets and
oral swabs from the PDX-bearing animals were
negative for Fusobacterium species (fig. S10), ar-
guing against the possibility of Fusobacterium spe-
ciesarisingfromtheendogenousmurinemicrobiota.
To evaluate the overall microbiome stability
and to identify bacteria that are persistently asso-
ciated with the primary colorectal tumor and de-
rived xenografts, we carried out unbiased total
RNA sequencing followed by PathSeq analysis,
which revealed that F. nucleatum and other
Gram-negative anaerobes, including B. fragilis
and S. sputigena, persist in these PDX models
for multiple generations (Fig. 3B). The bacteria
that persist within the PDX include the genera
that we report to persist in distant-site metastases
to the liver (Fig. 1C) and that are enriched in
Fusobacterium-associated colorectal cancer from
analysis of TCGA data (Fig. 1F). Bacterial 16S rRNA
gene sequencing further confirmed the persistence
of Fusobacterium and co-occurring anaerobes in
these primary colorectal tumors and derived xeno-
grafts (fig. S11).
Transmission electron microscopy showed that
F. nucleatum isolates from both the primary co-
lon carcinoma and PDX were invasive when incu-
bated with human colon cancer cell lines HT-29
and HCT-116. Upon infection with F. nucleatum,
we saw evidence of bacterial cells within vesicle-
like structures in the cancer cell (fig. S12, A to C).
We also observed evidence of bacterial adhesion
and invasion in the respective patient xenograft
tissue (fig. S12D).
Finally, we asked whether treatment of
Fusobacterium-positive colon cancer xenografts with
either (i) an antibiotic to which Fusobacterium is
resistantor(ii)anantibiotictowhichFusobacterium
is sensitive would affect tumor growth. We chose
erythromycin as a resistant antibiotic because the
F. nucleatum clinical isolates were resistant to
high concentrations of erythromycin (minimum
inhibitory concentration >25 mg/ml) (fig. S13A).
After oral gavage of the Fusobacterium-harboring
PDX COCA36, with erythromycin, we observed a
slight decrease in tumor volume compared with
mice treated with the vehicle control. However,
erythromycin did not significantly affect the tra-
jectory of tumor growth (P = 0.073) (fig. S13B),
Fusobacterium tumor load (P = 0.98) (fig. S13C),
or tumor cell proliferation (P = 0.3) (fig. S13D).
For a Fusobacterium-killing antibiotic, we chose
metronidazole because fusobacteria are known
to be highly sensitive to this drug (30). We then
confirmed sensitivity of the F. nucleatum isolate
from PDX COCA36 (minimum inhibitory concen-
tration < 0.01 mg/ml)(fig. S14). Because PDXs could
not be generated from Fusobacterium-negative
primary tumors, we treated Fusobacterium-free
xenografts derived from HT-29 colon adeno-
carcinoma cells with metronidazole to assess
whether metronidazole inhibits the growth of
Fusobacterium-negative colorectal carcinomas.
This experiment revealed no significant change
in tumor growth (P = 0.88) (Fig. 4A).
Finally, oral administration of metronidazole
to mice bearing Fusobacterium-positive PDXs re-
sulted in a statistically significant decrease in the
trajectory of tumor growth, compared with PDXs
in mice treated with vehicle (P = 0.0005) (Fig. 4A).

nificant reduction in tumor cell proliferation (P =

We have shown that (i) Fusobacterium is per-
sistently associated with distant metastases from
primary human colorectal cancers; (ii) invasive
Fusobacterium can be detected in liver metastases
by ISH; (iii) Fusobacterium co-occurs with other
Gram-negative anaerobes in primary and matched

tions;and(v)treatmentofaFusobacterium-harboring

eration, and tumor growth.
The persistence of Fusobacterium and its asso-
ciated microbiome in both metastasis and PDXs,
as well as the ability of antibiotic treatment to
reduce PDX growth, point to the potential of
Fusobacterium, and its associated microbiota,
to contribute to colorectal cancer growth and
metastasis. On the basis of our observation that
the dominant microbiome is highly similar in
primary-metastatic pairs and the concordance
of Fusobacterium strains found in primary tu-
mors and paired metastases, we hypothesize that
Fusobacterium travels with the primary tumor
cells to distant sites, as part of metastatic tissue
colonization. This suggests that the tumor micro-
biota are intrinsic and essential components of
the cancer microenvironment.
Our results highlight the need for further
studies on microbiota modulation as a potential
treatment for Fusobacterium-associated colorec-
tal carcinomas. One concern is the negative effect
of broad spectrum antibiotics on the healthy
intestinal microbiota. Given that metronida-
zole targets a range of anaerobic bacteria, in-
cluding co-occurring anaerobes that persist
with Fusobacterium, one would ideally want
to develop a Fusobacterium-specific antimicrobial
agent to assess the effect of selective targeting of
Fusobacterium on tumor growth. Important ques-
tions raised by our findings are whether conven-
tional chemotherapeutic regimens for colorectal
cancer will affect the colon cancer microbiota and
whether the microbiota will modulate the re-
sponse to such therapies. A recent study, reporting
that colorectal tumors with a high Fusobacterium
load are more likely to develop recurrence (21),
supports the concept that Fusobacterium-positive
tumors may benefit from anti-fusobacterial ther-
apy. Our results provide a strong foundation for
pursuing targeted approaches for colorectal can-
cer treatment directed against Fusobacterium and
other key constituents of the cancer microbiota.

Fig. 4. Treatment of Fusobacterium-colonized PDXs with metronidazole reduces tumor
growth in vivo. (A) (Left) Tumor volume percentage of Fusobacterium-free xenografts
derived from HT-29 cells treated with metronidazole (treated; 19 animals) or with vehicle
(untreated; 20 animals). (Right) Tumor volume percentage of Fusobacterium-positive
PDX tumors (COCA36) treated with metronidazole (treated; 25 animals) or with vehicle
(untreated; 22 animals). P values were determined by the Wald test. Tumors were measured
in a blinded fashion on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays each week. Error bars represent
mean ± SEM. The remaining number of HT-29-derived xenografts and PDX-implanted animals
at each time point is included in the supplementary materials. (B) Assessment of Fusobacterium
tissue load. Fusobacterium-targeted qPCR on PDX tissue (COCA36) after treatment with
metronidazole (treated) or with vehicle (untreated). ND, not detected. The center bar represents
the mean; error bars indicate SEM. P values were determined using Welch’s two-sample t test.
DCt, delta cycle threshold; PTG, prostaglandin transporter. (C) Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
immunohistochemistry of PDX tumors to assess cell proliferation. The bar plot represents
the percentage of cells with BrdU incorporation in treated and untreated PDXs (n = 6 animals
per arm); error bars denote mean ± SEM. P values were determined using the Welch’s
two-sample t test.
