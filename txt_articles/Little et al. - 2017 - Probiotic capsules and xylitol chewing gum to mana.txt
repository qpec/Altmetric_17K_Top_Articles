here are 800 consultations per 10 000 patients annually 
in the United States for pharyngotonsillitis.1 Although 
most cases are viral, a substantial proportion are caused 
by pathogenic streptococci.2–4 Despite the risk of antibiotic resis-
tance from the prescribing of antibiotics in primary care, most 
patients who present with pharyngitis still receive these drugs.5–9 
The risk of antibiotic resistance increases with the use of 
broader-spectrum antibiotics, an approach that has been advo-
cated because of the waning effectiveness of penicillin V.10,11
Both patients and health professionals are concerned about 
complications of infections,12 but symptom control is actually 
patients’ main concern;13 therefore, finding alternatives to imme-
diate antibiotics to help control symptoms is a priority. A major 
economic argument for using antibiotics is the assumption that 
individuals who are ill and the parents of children with illness will 
take more time off work.14 However, if simple treatments could 
limit the effects of both bacterial and viral infections and help 
patients to manage symptoms, enabling a quicker return to 
work, the societal arguments to use antibiotics would be weaker.
Xylitol is a birch sugar that causes local “bacterial interfer-
ence” by inhibiting bacterial growth and adherence to the 
pharyn 
geal wall,15–18 which should reduce the inflammation and 
the severity of symptoms caused by bacterial infections. 
Although sorbitol has no such effect, chewing gum could plau-

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Reducing the use of anti-
biotics for upper respiratory tract infec-
tions is needed to limit the global threat 
of antibiotic resistance. We estimated 
the effectiveness of probiotics and xyli-
tol for the management of pharyngitis.
METHODS: In this parallel-group fac-
torial randomized controlled trial, par-
ticipants in primary care (aged 3 years 
or older) with pharyngitis underwent 
randomization by nurses who provided 
sequential intervention packs. Pack 
contents for 3 kinds of material and 
advice were previously determined by 
computer-generated random numbers: 
no chewing gum, xylitol-based chewing 
gum (15% xylitol; 5 pieces daily) and sor-
bitol gum (5 pieces daily). Half of each 
group were also randomly assigned to 
receive either probiotic capsules (con-
taining 24 × 109 colony-forming units of 
lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) or pla-
cebo. The primary outcome was mean 
self-reported severity of sore throat and 
difficulty swallowing (scale 0–6) in the 
first 3 days. We used multiple imputation 
to avoid the assumption that data were 
missing completely at random.
RESULTS: A total of 1009 individuals 
consented, 934 completed the baseline 
assessment, and 689 provided complete 
data for the primary outcome. Probiot-
ics were not effective in reducing the 
severity of symptoms: mean severity 
scores 2.75 with no probiotic and 2.78 
with probiotic (adjusted difference 
–0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
–0.24 to 0.24). Chewing gum was also 
ineffective: mean severity scores 2.73 
without gum, 2.72 with sorbitol gum 
(adjusted difference 0.07, 95% CI –0.23 
to 0.37) and 2.73 with xylitol gum 
(adjusted difference 0.01, 95% CI –0.29 
to 0.30). None of the secondary out-
comes differed significantly between 
groups, and no harms were reported.
INTERPRETATION: Neither probiotics 
nor advice to chew xylitol-based chew-
ing gum was effective for managing 
pharyngitis. Trial registration: ISRCTN, 
no. ISRCTN51472596

sibly help both bacterial and viral throat infections by generat-
ing more saliva. Probiotics are benign, nonpathogenic bacteria 
that may act through both local “interference” and the immune 
system — thus affecting both viral and bacterial infections — 
including local activation of immunoglobulin A and T cells.19,20 
Cochrane reviews have suggested that probiotics can prevent 
recurrence of upper respiratory tract infections21 (although the 
quality of the evidence is limited) and that xylitol can also 
reduce recurrence.22
It is plausible that both probiotics and xylitol could limit the 
severity of pharyngeal infections and help with symptom control, 
but there is no direct evidence to support this supposition. Our 
aim was to estimate the efficacy of probiotics and xylitol chewing 
gum in the symptomatic management of pharyngitis. 
Methods
Design and setting
This parallel-group, individually randomized controlled trial had 
an equal allocation ratio. We invited practices around the study 
centre in Southampton, England, to participate. There were no 
exclusion criteria for practices.
Participant recruitment and eligibility
We used a variety of recruitment mechanisms. We sent letters to 
individuals who had previously consulted with pharyngitis, 
inviting them to participate should a new episode develop. Par-
ticipants were also identified opportunistically when presenting 
to their general practitioner. Participants were assessed by 
either the physician or a practice nurse to determine eligibility 
for the study. 
We included previously well people, aged 3 years or older, 
with an acute illness (≤ 21 d), with sore throat as the main symp-
tom and abnormal results on throat examination.
We excluded individuals with a history of peritonsillar 
abscess, rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis; those reporting 
allergy to any constituents of the gum; and those with serious 
chronic disorders mandating antibiotics (e.g., cystic fibrosis). We 
also excluded individuals with suspected pregnancy or immune 
deficiency.
Intervention
We used a 3 × 2 factorial design, based on a xylitol factor and a 
probiotic factor.
The xylitol factor had 3 alternatives: xylitol gum (Wrigley Orbit 
gum with 15% xylitol), sorbitol gum (Wrigley Extra gum with no 
xylitol [i.e., no active ingredient]) or advice not to chew gum. 
Patients in the 2 gum groups were advised to chew 5 sticks 
per day for 3 months, based on a similar regimen in prior 
studies,16–18,22 and were provided with supplies of chewing gum. 
We included the nonchewing group to ensure that chewing itself 
was not important. 
Each patient in these 3 groups was then randomly assigned to 
receive probiotic capsules or placebo capsules (all capsules sup-
plied by Cultech), to be taken daily, with milk, for 3 months. Each 
active probiotic capsule contained a mixture of lactobacilli and 
bifidobacteria species (Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL60 [NCIMB 
30157], Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL21 [NCIMB 30156], Bifido­
bacterium bifidum CUL20 [NCIMB 30153], Bifidobacterium ani­
malis ssp. lactis CUL34 [NCIMB 30172]), which provided, in com-
bination, 24 × 109 colony-forming units.
All study participants had access to usual care. Prescription of 
medication or referral was at the physicians’ discretion, accord-
ing to their usual practices (i.e., not standardized).
Randomization
Randomization was carried out by nurses, who gave an interven-
tion pack to each eligible patient, according to a predefined 
sequential order. The contents of each pack were previously 
determined by a University of Southampton statistician (inde-
pendent of the main study team), who used computer-generated 
random numbers to determine 3 kinds of material and advice for 
each pack: no offer of chewing gum, advice to use xylitol-based 
chewing gum or advice to use sorbitol-based chewing gum. The 
patients in each group were also randomly assigned to receive 
either probiotic capsules or placebo probiotic capsules, as 
described above. Participants were blinded as to whether they 
were receiving probiotics; they could not be blinded as to 
whether they chewed gum or not, but were blinded to the 
hypothesis that xylitol could help. 
We used sequential packs for 2 reasons. The complex factorial 
design made group differentiation more difficult to guarantee, so 
use of the packs facilitated immediate access to the correct 
structured materials and advice sheets for each group, ensuring 
robust group differentiation and greater logistic simplicity for 
recruiters. In addition, with its attention to equipoise, this 
method has resulted in robust randomization in several previous 
studies.23–26 In the current study, there was no evidence of selec-
tive use of numbered packs or of meaningful differences in group 
characteristics.
Baseline clinical data
We recorded the following baseline symptoms and signs, 
included in previous clinical scores:2,27–29 inflammation of the 
pharynx, presence of cough, temperature (using Tempa-DOT 
thermometers, 3M), pus on the tonsils, cervical nodes and dura-
tion of prior infection. The number of episodes of sore throat in 
the previous 3 months was also recorded, as was past tonsillec-
tomy and smoking status. We did not take throat samples for cul-
ture: this approach is not recommended routinely in the United 
Kingdom and would have increased barriers to study entry.
Outcome measurement
Each participant was given a symptom diary, with instructions 
to complete the diary at the end of each day, for up to 14 days, 
docu 
menting the severity of sore throat, difficulty swallowing, 
feeling unwell, fever and sleep disturbance. For very young chil-
dren who were unable to complete the diary, parents were 
asked to supply the information. The format of the symptom 
diaries has been validated for use for both sore throat and 
other respiratory infections, each symptom being scored from 0 
(no problem) to 6 (as bad as it could be).2,23,30,31 If a patient did

E1545
not return the symptom diary, we sent a brief questionnaire to 
document the key outcomes; we have previously shown the 
reliability of this questionnaire.23 If the patient did not respond 
to the questionnaire, we made telephone calls to collect the 
same data.
The primary outcome was the severity of sore throat and diffi-
culty swallowing on days 2–5. Before day 2, interventions are 
unlikely to affect symptoms, and after day 5 the symptoms usu-
ally present little or no problem. Data for several days (i.e., days 
2–5) provide a more reliable estimate of symptomatic burden 
than data for a single day. We chose the 2-item score (sore throat 
and difficulty swallowing) as the main outcome because it is 
more reliable than either item alone and is internally very reli-
able (Cronbach α = 0.92).2
We also collected data for the following additional outcomes: 
time to complete resolution of symptoms and time to resolution 
of symptoms rated as moderately bad or worse in the symptom 
diary (reported as median number of days), time to return to 
work or normal activities, and reported episodes of sore throat in 
the previous 3 months. We also reviewed medical records for up 
to 6 months to document complications, recurrence of pharyn-
gitis, new consultations and referrals. These assessments were 
blinded as to treatment group, an approach that has been shown 
to be reliable and unbiased.7

Changes to the protocol
Before the study began, our initial plan was to use a xylitol 
spray; however, the manufacturer of the spray declined to par-
ticipate, so xylitol chewing gum was used instead, and a no-gum 
group was included to assess whether chewing itself was help-
ful. We originally allowed for a response rate of 80% and initially 
included only adults. Following commencement of the study, 
the Trial Steering Committee recommended that the sample 
size be increased, for 2 reasons: to include children as a sub-
group and because of a lower-than-expected response rate 
(about 70%) for the primary outcome. This lower response rate 
also meant that our original plan for the primary analysis of 
complete cases was changed to an analysis using multiple 
imputed data (since we could not assume that missing data 
were missing completely at random). Nevertheless, for compari-
son, we also present here the complete case analysis for the pri-
mary outcome. We originally planned to measure patient satis-
faction with the consultation using a measure developed 
specifically for a trial of management of acute pharyngitis;23 
however, given the context of a longer treatment course and 
blinding of one of the interventions, this item was judged inap-
propriate and was dropped from the study. 
Statistical analysis
We performed an intention-to-treat analysis using regression 
models (Cox regression for time to resolution of symptoms; 
nega 
tive binomial regression for number of sore throats and 
number of days to return to work; and multivariable binomial 
regression for reconsultation), controlling for variables that 
were judged on clinical grounds to be potential confounders, 
including antibiotics prescribed (as listed at the bottom of each 
table). We estimated the main effects of intervention group sep-
arately, as well as comparing the xylitol and no-xylitol groups 
and determining the interaction between xylitol and probiotics. 
We performed multiple imputation in Stata software (StataCorp 
LLC), using a chained equation model, including participants’ 
baseline characteristics, the outcome variables and the random-
ization group.
We performed the following subgroup analyses: children, 
patients with 3 or more of the criteria of Centor and colleagues27 
and patients with higher temperature (> 37.5°C).23 
We did not allow for multiple comparisons; rather, each group 
was treated as an experimental group in its own right, for com-
parison with control, following Freidlin and colleagues.32 The trial 
was originally powered a priori for adults for the 3 xylitol factor 
groups: to detect a standardized effect of 0.36 (0.5 points in the 
sore throat score, which would represent 1 person in 2 rating 
sore throat as a little problem instead of a moderately bad prob-
lem), assuming a 5% 2-sided significance level, required 123 
(80% power) or 164 (90% power) participants per group. We ini-
tially allowed for 20% loss to follow-up, but with lower response 
rates, we revised the total sample size to 528 (80% power) and 
705 (90% power), allowing for 30% loss to follow-up.
For children, we estimated that to detect a standardized 
effect size of 0.5 between groups, assuming a 5% 2-sided signifi-
cance level, would require 64 children per group (80% power) or 
a total sample size of 276 children, allowing for 30% loss to 
follow-up.
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the Southampton Research Ethics 
Committee for Southampton and Southwest Hampshire (ref. no. 
05/Q1702/11).
Results
Participants were recruited between June 25, 2010, and June 
30, 2014, with 1009 patients undergoing initial randomization. 
Of these, 934 had complete baseline data, and the primary out-
come was recorded for 689 (73.8%) of these participants with 
baseline data (Figure 1). Because of consultation pressures dur-
ing winter, practices kept poor records for eligible participants 
who were not recruited to the study. The main reason reported 
for not recruiting participants was being too busy, so physi-
cians were also too busy to document data for those not 
recruited. Forty-nine people who did not want to participate 
gave reasons: 16 did not wish to chew gum, 24 did not have 
enough time, 6 were unwell, and 3 were pregnant or trying to 
become pregnant. 
Participants recorded in their diaries the numbers of pro-
biotic capsules and pieces of gum used each day. We agreed 
that participants who used 75% of more of their study medica-
tion would be considered “compliant.” According to that defini-
tion, 95.6% (281/294) of the probiotic group and 85.9% 
(317/369) of the gum group (84.4% [157/186] of the sorbitol 
group and 87.4% [160/183] of the xylitol group) were compliant 
in the first 14 days. 
Patient characteristics were well balanced for the factorial 
groups (probiotic v. no probiotic; sorbitol or xylitol gum v. no 
gum) and also for the comparison between no xylitol (i.e., sorbitol 
and no-gum groups combined) and xylitol (Table 1). The partici-
pants had problems with recurrent infections, with more than 
50% having had 2 or more episodes of sore throat during the 
3 months before the study; in addition, about 10% of participants 
had a prior tonsillectomy.
There was no evidence of an interaction between xylitol and 
probiotics for the primary outcome, the mean score for sore 
throat and difficulty swallowing on days 2–5 after the consulta-
tion (interaction term –0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] –0.57 to 
0.41). Table 2 documents the primary outcome: there were no 
significant differences between groups for both the xylitol and 
the probiotic groups, which suggests that neither intervention 
helped in controlling acute symptoms. The results were similar 
for the complete case analysis (Appendix 1, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170599/-/DC1). 
There was no evidence of an important effect in any of the pre-
defined subgroups: children, participants with 3 or more of the 
Centor criteria and those with temperature above 37.5°C (Table 
3). For all comparisons, there was no significant difference 
between groups in terms of symptom resolution (Table 4), recur-
rence of sore throat (Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170599/-/DC1) or reconsultations

(Appendix 3, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.170599/-/DC1). The only comparison of borderline significance 
was a modest reduction in the number of sore throat episodes for 
those using xylitol relative to the other groups (adjusted risk ratio 
[RR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01); this result was likely due to chance. 
There were no differences between groups in terms of work-
related absences, and number of days to return to work or normal 
activities was not significantly different between groups (RR for 
probiotic group 1.02 [95% CI 0.70 to 1.50] and for xylitol group 1.22 
[95% CI 0.82 to 1.81]).  No harms were reported.
Interpretation
This is one of the few studies to address the 
effectiveness of 2 promising over-the-coun-
ter remedies for acute pharyngitis. The 
results show that neither probiotics nor xyli-
tol is likely to have a meaningful effect.
Previous studies have not addressed 
short-term symptom control. Although prior 
evidence suggested that probiotics and xyli-
tol may prevent recurrence,21,22 we docu-
mented only a nonsignificant 15% reduction 
in recurrence with xylitol. 
Limitations
Follow-up was lower than in our previous 
trials,2,23 but the imputed estimates were 
similar to the complete data, and we 
assume that participants with follow-up 
were also more likely to comply with study 
recommendations, which makes the null 
results even more convincing. The extent of 
attrition may reflect suboptimal engage-
ment of practices in the consent process, 
problems with the recruitment mechanism 
or participants’ distaste for chewing gum; 
the latter explanation seems less likely, 
given similar follow-up for all groups for the 
xylitol factor. The symptomatic outcomes 
were all self-reported, but self-reported 
symptom diaries are known to be reliable, 
valid and sensitive to change.23,25,30,33 Despite 
an open design for the xylitol factor, there 
was no evidence of any placebo effect that 
would have biased the outcome assess-
ment. The follow-up period was short, so 
the effect of treatments on recurrence of 
pharyngitis could not be reliably assessed. 
Practices’ records for patients who were not 
recruited were poor, because the main rea-
son for not recruiting was being too busy. 
The clinical characteristics were similar to 
those of recent cohorts,7 except for more 
frequent sore throats, more participants 
having had tonsillectomy and a longer 
duration of illness (10 d v. mean of 5 d seen 
previously23); as such, we may have under-
estimated the effect of the interventions in 
a less severely affected group. The border-

the number of recurrences is likely to represent type I error, 
given the number of outcomes assessed. We did not have suffi-
cient power to assess the subgroup of children separately, so its 
negative findings must be interpreted with caution.
Conclusion
Neither probiotics nor xylitol chewing gum was effective in con-
trolling the symptoms of pharyngitis. As such, there is no reason 
for clinicians to advise patients to use either of these treatments 
for the symptomatic management of pharyngitis.
