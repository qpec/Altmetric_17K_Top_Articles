Abstract
Employer-sponsored well-being programs have been growing in popularity as a means to control rising health
care costs and increase workplace productivity. Engagement by employees is necessary for these programs to
achieve their desired effects. Extrinsic motivators in the form of incentives and surcharges are commonly
introduced by employer program sponsors to promote meaningful engagement. Although these may be suc-
cessful in achieving a degree of engagement, individuals benefit by being intrinsically motivated as they modify
behaviors and improve short- and long-term well-being. Telephonic guides equipped with motivational inter-
viewing and other behavioral strategies to improve engagement may bridge the gap between extrinsic and
intrinsic motivation. The objectives of this study are to determine characteristics associated with employee
utilization of these guides when offered and to compare subsequent program engagement rates between utilizers
to a propensity score matched group of employees who were not offered the service. The data were retrieved
from a well-being program provider’s database. The study examined 166,258 employees across 35 employers. It
found utilizers were older, proportionally more female, in the manufacturing industry, incented to use the guide
service, offered a larger incentive for program participation, had healthier self-reported behaviors, and had a
higher perception of their employer’s focus on well-being. The study found that guide utilizers were signifi-
cantly more likely to engage in telephonic coaching, digital coaching, and activity tracking up to 6 months. The
study’s findings suggest telephonic guides using a range of behavioral techniques are an effective strategy to
drive well-being program engagement.

Introduction
A
growing number of large employers in the United
States have adopted a well-being or health promotion
program as a component of their employee health benefit.1,2
Although these programs are aimed at helping individuals
improve their health status in myriad ways, including placing
an increased value on health, setting well-being–related
goals, participating in specific activities, and promoting so-
cial connectivity3,4 to improve specific health risks, the study
team and others recognize that most individuals will infre-
quently spontaneously change their health-related behaviors.
Without meaningful engagement by employees, programs
cannot achieve their desired effect. Variance in observed
participation rates has prompted a vein of research dedicated
to understanding what characteristics determine individual
engagement.5 Although individual characteristics (eg, age,
sex, education level) associated with participation are out of
an employer’s hands, there are strategies that may be em-
ployed to boost engagement rates.
To stimulate engagement, employers often introduce ex-
trinsic motivators, in the form of incentives (direct payments,
health plan premium reductions, drawing entries) and/or
penalties (surcharges).6 These extrinsic motivators do not
necessarily guarantee long-term success in molding positive
behaviors.7,8 With a lack of intrinsic motivation, participation
in well-being programs and achievement of long-term health
status improvement may simply be seen by individuals as a

 task to be completed to earn an incentive or avoid a penalty.
Therefore, successful well-being initiatives must effectuate
the transition of those who initially engage as a result of
extrinsic motivators to an intrinsically motivated state.9
A successful approach often benefits from an individual
exploring opportunities for change and making a commit-
ment to another human being as manifested in the technique
of motivational interviewing (MI).10–12 MI leverages an in-
dividual’s innate proclivity to regulate his or her behavior -
to grow and integrate in pursuit of personal well-being.13 MI
is utilized in the context of collaborative guided conversation
with an individual to elicit personal goals, listening for and
reinforcing ‘‘change talk,’’ informing about relevant options,
and closing a conversation with a commitment to make even
a small change.12,14,15 Successful MI leads to an intrinsically
motivated individual more able to successfully take specific
action to change their behavior.16
There are additional techniques and strategies that can be
employed within the context of the motivational interview to
promote an individual’s successful behavior change. The
principles of ethical influence capture the effects of personal,
social, and environmental impact on behavior.17–20 Habit
formation techniques21 have been incorporated in many ini-
tiatives designed to improve successful adoption of a wide
range of behaviors. The cognitive behavioral model, pro-
motion of self-efficacy, mental contrasting techniques,22–25
and incorporation of the transtheoretical model26–29 have
been demonstrated to improve the likelihood of success in
making otherwise difficult behavior changes, such as in-
creasing physical activity, eating healthier, and quitting
smoking.30–32 Mental contrasting consists of soliciting one to
envision the desired future state and contrast that with current
reality along with overcoming obstacles for achieving the
future state.33 Transtheoretical model-based consultation in-
volves establishing the current stage of the individual,
‘‘precontemplation’’ through ‘‘maintenance,’’ and consulting
them based on where they are along the continuum. Scholars
agree that a combination of techniques is ideal for successful
interventions.31
This study evaluates of the impact of a 1-time, short tele-
phonic engagement support consultation with a guide (‘‘Next
Step Consult’’ [NSC]), based on a multi-foundational be-
havioral framework inclusive of the aforementioned princi-
ples and models. The primary goal of the consultation is to
improve engagement in employer-sponsored health and well-
being programs. The objectives of this paper are 2-fold. First,
to determine individual, employer, and incentive character-
istics associated with utilization of the consult service when
offered. Second, to determine the short- and long-term effects
of the consult service on participation in 3 types of well-being
programs: telephonic coaching, digital coaching, and activity
tracking.
Methods
Intervention: NSC
The telephonic engagement support session is referred to as
‘‘Next Step Consult’’ (NSC) as it is intended to help individ-
uals take the next step to participate in well-being programs to
improve their health after completing a health risk assessment
(HRA) questionnaire or a biometric screening. Following
completion of an HRA or biometric screening, individuals are
able to schedule the NSC with a health guide trained in the
aforementioned behavioral methods via a web portal or over
the phone. The average NSC lasts 10 to 15 minutes.
During the consultation, the trained guide uses elements
from the aforementioned behavioral change techniques ap-
propriate for each individual to encourage him or her to
commit to health improvement goals and engage in sup-
portive well-being programs. The guide (a) ensures that the
individual understands their personal health risks (obtained
from HRA and/or biometric screening), (b) assists the indi-
vidual in identifying and understanding underlying personal
motivators, (c) facilitates the individual setting relevant
health goals and breaking these into smaller and more easily
achieved steps, and then (d) encourages enrollment in ap-
propriate well-being programs chosen by the individual.
Individuals included in this study were presented an on-
line privacy policy through the wellness portal that describes
the measures in place to protect their Personal Health In-
formation and the use of data in accordance with the Privacy
Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996 and employer-specific agreements. All data
were de-identified prior to attainment by researchers for
analysis.
Setting
This is a longitudinal observational study across 35 self-
insured employers who were contracted with a single well-
being program provider as of January 1, 2014. Typically,
decisions regarding well-being program offerings are made in
collaboration between the employer, the well-being program
provider, and third-party benefit consultants. Employers may
offer different programs to subpopulations defined by indi-
vidual characteristics such as relation to employee, benefit
enrollment status, and other occupational characteristics such
as whether an employee is full time. Available well-being
programs were promoted on a personalized web portal. Fol-
lowing completion of an HRA and often a biometric screen-
ing, individuals were presented a series of recommended
well-being programs and also were able to explore other
available programs. When offered, NSC was presented at this
point. Email communications encouraging use of NSC and
well-being programs were frequently used to encourage par-
ticipation. Additionally, print mailings, workplace signage or
flyers, and portal notifications were used to promote well-
being program participation.
Inclusion criteria and outcomes
Inclusion criteria for employees studied were: being con-
tinuously eligible throughout the employer-specific benefit
season (1 year), completing an HRA, being offered all 3 well-
being program modalities (telephonic coaching, digital
coaching, and activity tracking), and having data available for
all control variables of interest.
For the objective of determining characteristics associated
with NSC utilization, the outcome of interest was whether
an employee completed a call during their employer’s spe-
cific benefit season. Employees not offered NSC were ex-
cluded from this analysis.
For the objective of estimating the effect of NSC call
completion on longitudinal participation, the outcomes of
interest were engagement in telephonic coaching, digital

 coaching, and activity tracking at 1 month, 3 months, and 6
months follow-up. Employees who were offered NSC and
did not utilize it were excluded from this analysis to limit
selection bias from the control sample. For the group of
employees who completed a NSC call, the study team ob-
served the month the call was completed and assigned that
as their reference month. For the control group, comprised
of employees not offered NSC, the team used the month of
HRA completion as their reference month. Follow-up en-
gagement months were then defined as the first, third, and
sixth month following each individual’s reference month.
Participation definitions for each modality were: active en-
rollment in a telephonic coaching program, progressing in a
digital coaching program, and logging activity (manually or
using a sync device) during the respective follow-up month.
Telephonic coaching involves a series of scheduled calls
with a well-being professional to set goals and improve
health status across a spectrum of well-being domains. En-
rollment in telephonic coaching begins following the com-
pletion of an initial assessment call, which is distinct from
NSC, and continues with follow-up calls throughout the
course of enrollment. Digital coaching programs are online,
self-driven, nonhuman interactions allowing individuals to
choose from a variety of steps or tasks to commit to and
complete within a specific well-being focus area. Focus
areas include tobacco cessation, nutrition, physical activity,
weight loss, financial management, stress management, and
disease management, among others. Activity tracking in-
volves logging physical activity, either manually online or
using a synced electronic device such as a pedometer, to
allow individuals to monitor and evaluate self-advancement
toward wellness goals.
Control variables
Age and sex were retrieved from personnel files received
from employers. Incentive structure documentation from the
well-being program provider included incentive amounts for
utilization of NSC as well as for participation in well-being
programs. Employer industry was derived using the North
American Industry Classification System.34 Of those in-
cented to utilize NSC, 75.0% were offered $50 and the rest
were offered some amount less than that. Given lack of
variability in the amount incented, the study team dichoto-
mized individuals as incented or not. Variability in program
participation amounts (total available for telephonic coach-
ing, digital coaching, and activity tracker) was limited as
well. Amounts were categorized at $0, $1-$399, and $400+.
Derived from the HRA were perceived employer support
of health (culture) and composite health score. The 5 re-
sponse categories describing perceived employer focus on
employee health ranged from ‘‘[employer] is not focused on
employee health and has work practices that are actually bad
for health’’ to ‘‘[employer] actively promotes the health of
employees.’’ Responses concentrated on the latter (62.7% of
responses). Responses were dichotomized so that respond-
ing in the highest category was labeled ‘‘high’’ and the other
4 were combined into ‘‘low.’’ The composite health score
was continuous and based on weighted responses to ques-
tions across a multitude of domains including tobacco ex-
posure, cardiovascular health, stress and coping, nutrition,
physical activity, among others. Higher scores represented
preferred health behaviors and favorable biometrics. As the
health score was highly left-skewed, quartiles were applied
to categorize responses across the continuous spectrum.
Other relation types (eg, spouses, adult dependents) were
excluded from the analysis for multiple reasons. The study
team did not know if and where nonemployees were em-
ployed and could not prescribe their workplaces’ industries.
The perceived employer focus on employee health question
from the HRA could potentially be interpreted by nonem-
ployees in a number of ways: in regard to the employee’s
employer, their own employer, or not applicable if they are
unemployed. The overall experience of nonemployees dif-
fers from that of employees in intangible ways that make
their inclusion in this analysis untenable.
Statistical analysis
Three statistical tests were employed throughout the
course of this research. Chi-square testing was used to
compare covariate differences between 2 sets of study co-
horts: employees who were offered and utilized NSC versus
those who were offered and did not utilize (describing who
uses this service when offered), and employees who were
offered and utilized NSC versus those who were not offered
(before and after matching, to answer whether the groups
used in propensity score matching differed systematically).
A probit model regression was run on the former cohort to
determine characteristics associated with completion of a
NSC call when offered. Finally, a propensity score matching
technique was employed to estimate the effects of NSC call
completion on longitudinal well-being program participa-
tion. All analyses were run using Stata version 13 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, TX).35
Individuals who were not offered NSC (control cohort)
were matched without replacement using propensity scores
to individuals who completed a NSC call (treated cohort).
Average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) were esti-
mated across each of the 3 program modalities at each of the
follow-up months.
Results
A total population of 166,258 employees met the criteria
for inclusion in the study. Within the total population,
60,506 (36.4%) were eligible to utilize NSC based on their
product offering. Of those eligible, 11,302 (18.7%) utilized
the service.
Descriptive statistics of the study sample are shown in
Table 1. All covariates were significantly different. NSC uti-
lizers were proportionally younger and more were male. The
proportion who were incented to utilize NSC was greater and
they distributed toward the higher participation incentive ca-
tegories. Utilizers were more likely to be in the manufacturing
industry, distributed more heavily into higher (healthier)
composite health score quartiles, and more likely to respond to
the highest perceived employer support category.

 (Table 2). Using the youngest age group (18–29 years old)
as reference, all other age groups were significantly more
likely to utilize NSC. Utilization of NSC was 3.5 times
higher for employees offered an incentive to use it than
those not incented. Employees with incentives tied to par-
ticipation in the program modalities were significantly more
likely to utilize NSC. Employees in the manufacturing in-
dustry had a significantly greater likelihood of utilizing than
the professional and service industries. Relative to the
lowest HRA score quartile each of the other quartiles had a
significantly greater likelihood of utilizing NSC. Employees
perceiving their employer to be highly focused on their
health were significantly more likely to utilize (Table 2).
Estimated effects of NSC on longitudinal participation
There were 11,302 eligible employees who were offered
and utilized NSC. A cohort of 11,302 controls was then
matched using a 1:1 non-replacement propensity score
matching technique. Table 3 offers a comparison of cov-
ariates between NSC utilizers and controls after matching.
None are statistically different.
Table 4 offers the ATT for each outcome of interest post
match. Participation rates across all program modalities
were significantly greater for individuals in the NSC cohort.
All were statistically significant.
For both cohorts, telephonic coaching enrollment in-
creased between 1 month and 3 months and then decreased
at 6 months (Table 4). The other 2 modalities decreased over
time from 1 month through 6 months for both cohorts.
Active engagement in digital coaching tapered 15.4% for
NSC utilizers and 4.1% for nonutilizers over the time period
between 1 and 6 months. Active engagement in activity
tracking tapered 11% for NSC utilizers and .9% for non-
utilizers over the same time period. In all instances rate
ratios decreased over time. To provide context for these
engagement rates, the study team observed 13,485 (59.7%)
of the total matched cohort engaged in at least 1 of the
program modalities in the 6 months following their refer-
ence month.

IMPACT OF TELEPHONIC GUIDES ON PARTICIPATION

 Discussion
The purpose of this research was to identify characteristics
of NSC utilizers compared to nonutilizers and to estimate
the effect of NSC utilization on engagement in well-being
programs.
Characteristics of NSC call completers
This study presents a significant gender effect in NSC
utilization. Previous research has found females participate
in well-being programs at higher rates than men,36 a finding
observed in the present study. In studying workplace well-
ness programs of Fortune 100 employers, Mattke et al found
females were more likely to complete an HRA but men were
more likely to participate in lifestyle management and dis-
ease management programs.2 NSC occurs after the HRA in
this study and would be somewhat comparable to a lifestyle
or disease management program in terms of individual in-
volvement, although it is a single interaction rather than an
ongoing program. The influence of sex on well-being is
complex and would benefit from further investigation.
The youngest age group was least likely to utilize NSC. In
other studies it has been generally observed that older age
groups demonstrated an increased willingness to utilize
well-being program opportunities.2,36,37 Aging is associated
with increased condition prevalence, health care expendi-
tures, and poorer health status such as obesity,38 which may
be cause for increased health awareness and willingness to
engage in opportunities to improve health. Similar to sex,
age has a complex relationship with if and how an indi-
vidual engages in their well-being.
The way programs are incented affects whether or not an
individual chooses to engage in them, especially if the indi-
vidual is not intrinsically motivated. Having a direct financial
incentive tied to NSC was associated with increased utiliza-
tion. Having incentives tied to program participation also was
associated with greater utilization of NSC. A greater overall
incentive offering may be indicative of an overall stronger
well-being promotion culture at a given employer. Previous
literature has concluded that insufficient incentives are a
barrier to well-being program participation.39 Effectiveness
of incentives may be assessed a variety of ways. In the case of
a telephonic guide service, incentive effectiveness may be

 measured first by an increased likelihood of utilizing the
service and, second, an increased likelihood of program
participation after utilization of the service.
Work environment and varying job requirements by in-
dustry are important considerations when attempting to ef-
fectively engage a specific employee population. Others have
noted that engagement in telephonic coaching varied by in-
dustry and that both employer support (physical environment
and communications) and employee characteristics (female
and being older) influenced program engagement and com-
pletion.40 In this study, the employees in the manufacturing
industry were significantly more likely to utilize the guide
service than both the professional and service industry em-
ployees. Employees in the manufacturing industry likely
have less access to computers while at work, which may lead
them to prefer telephonic engagement options over digital.40
There may be different cultural and interpersonal preference
differences as well. This finding underscores the need for
employers to offer well-being support through a variety of
modalities to meet diverse needs across their employee
population.
Estimated effects of NSC on longitudinal participation
Telephonic consultation with a guide was associated with
a significant increase in short- and long-term engagement
across all well-being program modalities. There were dif-
ferences in relative rates for each of the modalities mea-
sured. Engagement rate ratios between NSC utilizers and
nonutilizers were considerably smaller for digital coaching
and activity tracking relative to phone coaching. This may
be because NSC utilizers have an overall predisposition
toward human interaction compared to digital interaction.
Nonutilizers may be less interested in personal interactions
regarding their health and may avoid NSC as well as phone
coaching, preferring to engage in self-directed program
options.
The most utilized program modality for both groups at all
time frames was activity tracking. In addition to being
useful as a stand-alone modality, activity tracking comple-
ments the other modalities as it allows an individual to
easily evaluate his or her nutrition and physical activity
behaviors, which are aspects of virtually every focus area in
the telephonic and digital coaching modalities.
Limitations
Although this paper did show that NSC support resulted
in higher rates of program participation, some limitations
should be noted. One limitation is that the study focused
solely on downstream well-being program engagement.
Changes in health risks and other metrics such as health care
claims were beyond the scope of this study. Follow-up re-
search would be useful to document the impact of NSC on
these measures as well.
For methods, the use of one-to-one nearest neighbor
matching without replacement effectively reduced bias
within observable variables and was possible because of a
large data set with a majority of observations being controls
(not offered service). However, it is appropriate to note that
propensity score matching could not control for all differ-
ences between NSC utilizers and nonutilizers. Given the
observational data underlying this study, unmeasured cov-
ariates are not necessarily evenly distributed among groups.
One can nonetheless reasonably assume that the present
study findings are reliably controlling for observable ex-
traneous differences between NSC utilizers and matched
controls.
Lack of variance in incentive structures (eg, specific
program modality amounts, NSC amounts, payout cadence)
led to issues in collinearity and an inability to measure the
specific effects of these characteristics. In addition to in-
creasing confidence in the models, further research on the
effects of incentive structures on NSC utilization as well as
longitudinal participation would lend itself to strategic rec-
ommendations on resource allocation for optimizing em-
ployee engagement in well-being programs.
How well-being program opportunities were communi-
cated by employers varied in frequency, medium (eg,
workplace flyers, electronic communications), and may
have been focused on certain segments of the employee
population. Data points on communications were not readily
available and represent a limitation of this study. This is
another facet of workplace wellness deserving of research to
increase engagement.
The phone coaching outcome used was active enrollment
during the respective month. This measure was used because
engagement in the phone coaching program was episodic
and individual calls could occur multiple times per month
but also were not necessarily occurring each month mea-
sured. Using call completion would have opened the pos-
sibility for an actively enrolled individual to be counted as
not engaged in a given month depending on their call ca-
dence. Phone enrollments were extended time frames and
rather insensitive, at least relative to digital coaching pro-
grams and activity tracking. A discrete measure such as call
completion would have been more aligned with the other
modalities’ definitions but would open the possibility of
misclassification.
Given that employee health benefit seasons were 12
months, extending participation time frames past 6 months
would increasingly open the possibility for overlap into the
following season. In excess this overlap could obscure results
because of additional exposure to reference interventions
(HRAs and NSCs) and seasonal changes to the well-being
program. Future research may investigate whether additional
intervention continues to stimulate well-being program en-
gagement and in what estimated dosing gradient.
Conclusions
The impact of a behavior change model
The well-being industry has long offered an introductory
telephonic interaction (often referred to as health advisor) to
present options for employees to engage in healthy activities
within well-being programs. The study team has no avail-
able data regarding the impact of these traditional ap-
proaches but employers have noted consistently that these
have had minimal impact on program engagement. The
professional guides providing the NSC service studied had
received specific training in a wide range of behavior change
methods and most have prior credentials and training in
areas of clinical lifestyle improvement such as registered
dietitian, exercise physiology, social work, health education,
and/or public health. The interaction model developed for

 this service incorporates a wide range of behavioral change
methods, in combination with fundamental MI techniques to
personalize the approach with each individual. This process
takes advantage of the personal accountability to another
human resulting from the commitments made during this
conversation. The study’s findings suggest telephonic guides
using a range of behavioral techniques are an effective
strategy to drive well-being program engagement.
