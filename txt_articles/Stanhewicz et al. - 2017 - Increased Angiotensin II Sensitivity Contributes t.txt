ardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of 
death for women in the United States,1 and as such, 
CVD risk in women is an important public health concern. In 
addition to the sex-independent classical risk factors for the 
development of CVD observed in both men and women, his-
tory of preeclampsia during pregnancy has recently emerged 
as a women-specific risk factor for the development of 
CVD. Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy 
that affects ≈5% to 8% of pregnancies in the United States 
and ≈8 million pregnancies worldwide.2 Otherwise healthy 
women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are at 
a significantly (2–7×) greater risk for the development of 
CVD3 and develop primary hypertension at a younger age 
and with greater frequency than women who have healthy 
pregnancies.4–7 Furthermore, women who have had pre-
eclampsia are significantly more likely to die of CVD8–10 
and represent an important at-risk cohort that requires early 
mechanism-specific intervention strategies to prevent or miti-
gate CVD morbidity and mortality.
Although the association between preeclampsia and 
chronic elevated CVD risk is apparent, the mechanism(s) 
responsible for this association are unknown. One emerging 
hypothesis for this association is irreversible endothelial dam-
age sustained during the preeclamptic pregnancy. In support of 
this hypothesis, healthy women with a history of preeclamp-
tic pregnancy demonstrate increased arterial stiffness11–14 and 
attenuated brachial artery flow-mediated dilation11,15 compared 
with women with a history of normal pregnancy. However, 
despite this compelling evidence for lasting endothelial dam-
age in formerly preeclamptic women, few, if any, in vivo 
human studies investigated the mechanism(s) responsible for 
this persistent vessel dysfunction in postpartum women.
Vascular studies in animal models of preeclampsia demon-
strate an increased vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II. This 
Abstract—Women who have had preeclampsia have increased cardiovascular disease risk; however, the mechanism(s) 
responsible for this association remain unclear. Microvascular damage sustained during a preeclamptic pregnancy may 
persist postpartum. The putative mechanisms mediating this dysfunction include a reduction in NO-dependent dilation 
and an increased sensitivity to angiotensin II. In this study, we evaluated endothelium-dependent dilation, angiotensin II 
sensitivity, and the therapeutic effect of angiotensin II receptor blockade (losartan) on endothelium-dependent dilation 
in vivo in the microvasculature of women with a history of preeclampsia (n=12) and control women who had a healthy 
pregnancy (n=12). We hypothesized that preeclampsia would have (1) reduced endothelium-dependent dilation, (2) 
reduced NO-mediated dilation, and (3) increased sensitivity to angiotensin II. We further hypothesized that localized 
losartan would increase endothelium-dependent vasodilation in preeclampsia. We assessed microvascular endothelium-
dependent vasodilator function by measurement of cutaneous vascular conductance responses to graded infusion of 
acetylcholine (acetylcholine; 10−7–102 mmol/L) and a standardized local heating protocol in control sites and sites treated 
with 15 mmol/L L-NAME (NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; NO-synthase inhibitor) or 43 µmol/L losartan. Further, we 
assessed microvascular vasoconstrictor sensitivity to angiotensin II (10−20–10−4 mol/L). Preeclampsia had significantly 
reduced endothelium-dependent dilation (−0.3±0.5 versus −1.0±0.4 logEC50; P<0.001) and NO-dependent dilation (16±3% 
versus 39±6%; P=0.006). Preeclampsia also had augmented vasoconstrictor sensitivity to angiotensin II (−10.2±1.3 
versus −8.3±0.5; P=0.006). Angiotensin II type I receptor inhibition augmented endothelium-dependent vasodilation and 
NO-dependent dilation in preeclampsia but had no effect in healthy pregnancy. These data suggest that women who have 
had preeclampsia have persistent microvascular dysfunction postpartum, mediated, in part, by increased sensitivity to 
angiotensin II.  (Hypertension. 2017;70:382-389. DOI: 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.09386.)

 Stanhewicz et al  Angiotensin II and Vascular Dysfunction After Preeclampsia  383
increased sensitivity to angiotensin II is mediated, in part, through 
an increased concentration of agonistic autoantibodies (AT1-AA) 
to the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) and contributes to the 
sequelae of vascular symptoms experienced during preeclamp-
sia.16,17 Similarly, pregnant women with preeclampsia have an 
exaggerated presser response to angiotensin II18–20 and exhibit 
elevated AT1-AA.21,22 Despite the remission of symptoms post-
partum, women who have had preeclampsia exhibit an increased 
sensitivity to systemic angiotensin II infusion.23 However, to date, 
the role of increased angiotensin II sensitivity in persistent endo-
thelial dysfunction has not been mechanistically examined in 
vivo in postpartum women who have had preeclampsia.
The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the 
mechanisms mediating persistent microvascular dysfunction in 
women who have had a preeclamptic pregnancy. Specifically we 
examined endothelium-dependent dilation, angiotensin II sensi-
tivity, and the therapeutic effect of AT1R blockade (losartan) on 
endothelium-dependent dilation in vivo in the cutaneous micro-
vasculature—a validated in vivo bioassay of systemic microvas-
cular function24–29—of women with a history of preeclampsia 
compared with control women who had a healthy pregnancy 
(HC). Complementary to our functional measures, we performed 
ex vivo analysis of receptor expression and endothelium-depen-
dent signaling pathways on cutaneous biopsy samples obtained 
from HC and preeclampsia. We hypothesized that preeclamp-
sia would have (1) reduced endothelium-dependent dilation, (2) 
reduced NO-mediated dilation, and (3) increased sensitivity to 
angiotensin II. We further hypothesized that localized losartan 
treatment would increase endothelium-dependent dilation in 
preeclampsia and that this increase would be mediated by an 
increase in NO-dependent dilation.
Methods
Study Population
Twenty-four healthy, normotensive, postpartum women who had 
delivered within the past 12 months participated in the study. Twelve 
of these women had a history of preeclampsia diagnosed by their 
obstetrician and confirmed according to the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria for severe preeclampsia.30 
Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of the Pennsylvania State University and the Food and Drug 
Administration. Written and verbal consent were obtained voluntarily 
from all subjects before participation according to the Declaration of 
Helsinki and the US Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46. Subjects 
were screened for neurologic, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases 
and underwent a complete medical screening, including physical 
examination, lipid profile, and blood chemistry (Quest Diagnostics, 
Pittsburgh, PA). All subjects were normally active, nonhypertensive, 
nondiabetic, healthy nonsmokers who were not taking prescription 
medications with primary or secondary vascular effects (eg, statins, 
antihypertensives, anticoagulants, etc). All women met the inclusion 
criteria of no history of gestational diabetes mellitus and no history 
of hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic 
blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg31) before or after pregnancy. Subjects were 
matched for age, time postpartum (months), body mass index, and 
blood chemistry. Control women had higher blood urea nitrogen and 
blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio; however, all values were within 
clinically normal range. Subject characteristics are presented in Table.
In Vivo Microvascular Reactivity Studies
Each subject participated in 2 separate laboratory visits. Intradermal 
microdialysis fibers (CMA Microdialysis, Holliston, MA) were 
placed into the dermal layer of the ventral forearm for the local 
delivery of pharmacological agents.32 Pharmacological agents were 
mixed just before use, dissolved in lactated Ringer solution, sterilized 
using syringe microfilters (Acrodisc; Pall, Ann Arbor, MI), wrapped 
in foil to prevent degradation because of light exposure, and perfused 
through the microdialysis fibers at a rate of 2 µL/min (Bee Hive con-
troller and Baby Bee microinfusion pumps; Bioanalytical Systems). 
Each protocol commenced after an initial hyperemia-resolution 
period (≈60–90 minutes). Cutaneous red blood cell flux was continu-
ally measured directly over each microdialysis site with an integrated 
laser Doppler flowmetry probe placed in a local heating unit (Moor 
Instruments, Wilmington, DE), which was set to thermoneutral 
(33°C) unless otherwise noted. Automated brachial blood pressure 
(Cardiocap; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) was measured every 5 
minutes throughout each protocol.
Cutaneous Vasodilator Responsiveness to 
Exogenous Acetylcholine and Local Heat
Three intradermal microdialysis fibers were placed and randomly 
assigned for the delivery of lactated Ringer (control), 15 mmol/L 
L-NAME (NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; Calbiochem; EMD 
Millipore, Billerica, MA) for the inhibition of NO synthase (NOS), 
or 43 µmol/L losartan (United States Pharmacopeial, Rockville, MD) 
for inhibition of AT1R.33
Acetylcholine Dose–Response Protocol
After baseline measurements, ascending concentrations of acetylcho-
line (10–7–102 mmol/L; United States Pharmacopeial), mixed with the 
site-specific inhibitor, were perfused sequentially for 5 minutes each 
to ensure a plateau. After acetylcholine doses, 28 mmol/L sodium 
nitroprusside (United States Pharmacopeial) was perfused and local 
temperature increased to 43°C to elicit maximal dilation (CVCmax).34
Local Heating Protocol
After baseline measurements, the temperature of the local heaters 
was raised to 42°C following a standardized local skin heating pro-
tocol.35–37 Once skin blood flow reached a plateau (≈30–40 minutes),

15 mmol/L L-NAME was perfused at each site to quantify in-site 
NO-dependent dilation. After a post-L-NAME plateau was estab-
lished, maximal dilation was achieved as described above.
Cutaneous Vasoconstrictor Responsiveness to 
Exogenous Angiotensin II and Norepinephrine
Two intradermal microdialysis fibers were placed and randomly 
assigned for the local delivery of angiotensin II or norepinephrine. 
After baseline measurement (lactated Ringer perfusion) sites received 
ascending concentrations of angiotensin II (10−20–10−4 mol/L; Tocris, 
Ellisville, MO) or norepinephrine (10–12–10–2 mol/L; Sigma, St. 
Louis, MO), doses were perfused sequentially for 5 minutes each to 
ensure a plateau.
Ex Vivo Skin Biopsy Sample Analysis
Two 3 mm3 ventral forearm skin samples were obtained under 
local anesthesia (2% lidocaine without epinephrine) as previously 
described.35 Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen 
and stored at −80°C until analysis. The expression levels of different 
proteins were determined by Western blotting. Samples were lysed 
in ice-cold 1× radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Upstate) con-
taining protease inhibitors (Roche), and total protein concentration 
was determined (Bio-Rad protein assay reagent). Equal amounts of 
lysate proteins (25 μg) from each sample were resolved by Sodium 
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotrans-
ferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk 
for 1 hour at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with 
primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase–conjugated 
antirabbit or antimouse antibody (1:1 000) for 1 hour at room tem-
perature. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was 
used as loading control. Rabbit monoclonal antiphospho (Ser1177) 
endothelial NO synthase (eNOS; 1:1 000; CellSignaling), mouse anti-
eNOS (1:1 000; BD Bioscience), Rabbit antiphospho (Ser239) VASP 
(vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; 1:1 000; CellSignaling), 
rabbit monoclonal anti-VASP (1:1 000; Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-
AT1R (1:1 000; Abcam), and mouse anti-GAPDH (1:5 000; Novus 
Biologicals) were used. Blots were developed using enhanced chemi-
luminescence using a ChemiDoc Touch Imaging system (Bio-Rad) 
and quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).
Data and Statistical Analysis
All data collection and analysis procedures were standardized before 
testing. Blood flow data were digitized at 40 Hz, recorded, and stored 
for offline analysis using Windaq software and Dataq data acquisition 
system (Dataq Instruments, Akron, OH). Blood flow data were ana-
lyzed by 2 independent investigators blinded to microdialysis drug 
treatment. CVC (cutaneous vascular conductance) was calculated 
(CVC=laser Doppler flux/mean arterial pressure) and normalized 
to a percentage of site-specific maximum (%max) for dilation and 
site-specific baseline (%base) for vasoconstriction. Acetylcholine-
mediated NO-dependent dilation was calculated as the difference 
between L-NAME treated and lactated Ringer sites at 102 mmol/L 
acetylcholine administration. In the local heating protocol, within-
site NO-dependent dilation was calculated as the difference between 
the local heating plateau and the post-L-NAME plateau.
Sample size (n=12 in each group) was determined a priori by pow-
er analysis (power=0.08; α=0.05), and significance was set a priori 
at α=0.05. Briefly, using previously published data with similar pri-
mary outcomes in subjects with microvascular dysfunction,33,35 we 
determined that 12 subjects per group would be sufficient to mea-
sure a meaningful physiological difference of at least 15% between 
microdialysis treatment sites (within subject) and between groups. 
Student unpaired t tests were used to compare subject characteristics 
and to examine differences in the densitometry analysis of Western 
blots. Dose–response CVC data were analyzed using sigmoidal dose–
response curve with variable slope.38 Absolute CVC data and %NO-
dependent dilation were analyzed using a 2-way repeated measures 
ANOVA (group×pharmacological site; SAS 9.4, Cary, IN) with post 
hoc Bonferroni corrections applied for specific planned comparisons 
when appropriate. Values are presented as mean±SEM.

Discussion
The primary findings of this study are that women who have had 
a preeclamptic pregnancy exhibit reduced endothelium-depen-
dent vasodilation and exaggerated vasoconstrictor sensitivity 
to angiotensin II postpartum, compared with parity-matched 
women who had a HC. Furthermore, the reduced endothe-
lium-dependent dilation is mediated, in part, by reductions in

NO-mediated mechanisms and is rescued by AT1R blockade. Ex 
vivo analysis showed that preeclampsia has preserved eNOS and 
VASP expression and phosphorylation, but has greater expres-
sion of AT1R compared with HC, suggesting that the increased 
sensitivity to angiotensin II is likely mediated by increased 
AT1R expression. Together, these findings suggest that despite 
the remission of clinical symptoms postpartum, women who 
have had a preeclamptic pregnancy exhibit persistent microvas-
cular dysfunction, which may contribute to increased lifetime 
CVD risk in these patients. Furthermore, AT1R inhibition may 
be a clinically relevant therapeutic strategy for the management 
of elevated CVD risk in this population.
The few in vivo human studies of vessel dysfunction after 
preeclamptic pregnancy have been qualitative, linking conduit 
vessel dysfunction with circulating vasoactive factors. These 
studies demonstrate attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodi-
lation after preeclampsia, evidenced by attenuated flow-medi-
ated dilation15 and increased retrograde shear rate.39 In the current 
study, we used the human cutaneous circulation as an in vivo 
bioassay to examine mechanisms of microvascular dysfunction. 
There is a significant relation between microvascular dysfunc-
tion assessed in the cutaneous microcirculation and that mea-
sured invasively in deeper microvascular beds,24–29 and in vivo 
mechanistic studies can be performed in the skin that would not 
otherwise be possible on a systemic level.40 Consistent with pre-
vious reports of dysfunction in large arteries, the current study 
shows that endothelium-dependent dilation responses to both 
pharmacological and physiological stimuli are attenuated in the 
microvasculature of otherwise healthy postpartum women who 
have had preeclampsia. Furthermore, the present data suggest 
that this reduced endothelial function is due, in part, to reduc-
tions in functional NO-mediated dilation. These findings suggest 
that women who have had preeclampsia may have a reduced 
NO bioavailability or secondary mechanisms are inhibiting 
NO-mediated relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle.
Interestingly, ex vivo analysis of cutaneous tissue samples 
indicate that women who have had preeclampsia have simi-
lar eNOS protein expression and phosphorylation to that of 
women who have had a HC. We also did not detect group dif-
ferences in VASP expression or phosphorylation. It is impor-
tant to note that the skin biopsy tissue represents a mixture of 
tissue types (cutaneous vessels, keratinocytes, nerve endings, 
etc), and we are limited by our inability to specifically assess 
protein expression in the vascular endothelium or vascular 
smooth muscle alone. However, these ex vivo data comple-
ment our functional findings and suggest that women who 
have had preeclampsia do not have attenuated NO production 
and that the NO is reaching the vascular smooth muscle. As 
such, it is likely that mechanisms secondary to NO production 
and diffusion to the vascular smooth muscle, such as increased 
vasoconstrictor tone, are affecting both endothelium- and 
NO-dependent dilation in these women.
Vasoconstrictor sensitivity to circulating angiotensin II is 
attenuated in normal pregnancy and this reduced sensitivity

contributes to the normal reduction in systemic vascular resis-
tance observed in HC.19 In contrast, women who develop 
preeclampsia have an exaggerated pressor response to angio-
tensin II during pregnancy—an effect that is likely mediated 
by increased circulating inflammatory cytokines and con-
comitant increases in circulating AT1-AA.16,17,41 Similarly, 
previously preeclamptic women demonstrate an augmented 
presser response to systemic angiotensin II infusion postpar-
tum, suggesting that this augmented sensitivity that arises dur-
ing pregnancy persists postpartum.23 Our data build on these 
findings and clearly demonstrate that women who have had 
preeclampsia exhibit a greater microvascular vasoconstric-
tor response to angiotensin II than control women matched 
for age and time postpartum. To test whether this enhanced 
constriction is specific to angiotensin II, we also assessed 
vasoconstrictor sensitivity to the adrenergic agonist norepi-
nephrine. The lack of difference in norepinephrine-mediated 
vasoconstriction between groups suggests that the increased 
sensitivity to angiotensin II observed in formerly preeclamptic 
women is specific to angiotensin II-activated receptor and sig-
naling mechanisms, and not generalized to receptor-mediated 
vasoconstrictor stimuli. Furthermore, ex vivo analysis showed 
that women who have had preeclampsia have increased AT1R 
protein expression. It is likely that this increased AT1R expres-
sion contributes, at least in part, to the increased sensitivity to 
angiotensin II observed in these women.
To examine the role of increased angiotensin II sensitiv-
ity in the attenuated microvascular vasodilator response in 
women who have had preeclampsia, we locally administered 
the AT1R inhibitor losartan during assessments of endothe-
lium- and NO-dependent dilation. We found that localized 
losartan treatment augmented endothelium-dependent and 
NO-dependent dilation in formerly preeclamptic women but 
had no effect in women with a history of HC. These data fur-
ther demonstrate that augmented angiotensin II sensitivity 
contributes to persistent microvascular dysfunction in women 
who have had preeclampsia.
Although circulating angiotensin II is not elevated dur-
ing or postpregnancy in women with preeclampsia,42 AT1-AA 
concentrations increase in women during a preeclamptic preg-
nancy21,22,43 and remain elevated postpartum.44 Although we 
did not assess circulating angiotensin II or AT1-AA in our sub-
jects, it is likely that chronically elevated AT1-AA contributes 
to persistent endothelial dysfunction in women who have had 
preeclampsia, independent of endogenous angiotensin II con-
centrations. In animal models of preeclampsia, AT1-AA induces 
a dose-dependent vasoconstriction response, which is abolished 
by AT1R blockade.45 As such, a possible alternative explanation 
for our finding that localized losartan treatment improved endo-
thelial function is that AT1R inhibition ameliorated chronic con-
strictor tone attributable to AT1-AA signaling. It is likely that a 
combination of both chronically elevated AT1-AA and increased 
AT1R sensitivity contribute to persistent endothelial dysfunction 
in women who have had preeclampsia, and the mechanisms 
mediating this balance require further investigation.
For the purpose of this study, we specifically recruited 
women who had delivered within the past year to examine 
persistent vascular dysfunction within the first 12 months 
after preeclamptic pregnancy. Within that timeframe, the 
variability of time postpartum may have modified our results. 
Importantly, our groups were matched for time postpartum. 
Our data clearly indicated that women who have had pre-
eclampsia exhibit microvascular dysfunction postpartum, 
even after the remission of clinical symptoms. However, our 
smaller sample size precluded subanalysis to explore the 
effect of time postpartum on indices of endothelial dysfunc-
tion. These studies speak solely to the first year postdeliv-
ery, and it remains unclear whether endothelial function may 
recover in these women over time. Vascular studies of con-
duit vessel endothelial function and arterial stiffness suggest 
that vascular impairments are detectable in women who have 
had preeclampsia ≤4 years, and possibly even 20 years after 
delivery.14,46–48 As such, the vascular injury that occurs dur-
ing a preeclamptic pregnancy likely persists throughout the 
patient’s life. Although our mechanistic findings focused on 
the first year postpartum, it is likely that increased sensitiv-
ity to angiotensin II and endothelial dysfunction persist in the 
years following, and in the absence of intervention, contribute 
to the development of overt CVD in these women.
Aside from its primary antihypertensive effects, systemic 
AT1R inhibition prevents the production of inflammatory 
mediators49,50 and reduces biomarkers of inflammation in pop-
ulations with known CVD.51–53 Similarly, chronic AT1R inhi-
bition improves endothelium-dependent dilation in patients 
with vascular dysfunction54,55 independent of reductions in 
blood pressure.56 Within this context, our findings suggest that 
women who have had preeclampsia may benefit from chronic 
AT1R inhibition to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis 
and mitigate elevated CVD risk.
To isolate history of preeclampsia as the primary factor 
contributing to vascular dysfunction, we limited our sample 
to women who were otherwise free of clinical, cardiovascular, 
and metabolic disease before, and post, pregnancy. However, 
our investigation is limited by our inability to characterize ves-
sel function in these women prepregnancy and we cannot rule 
out the possibility that these subjects had subclinical altera-
tions in microvascular function before pregnancy. Although 
not statistically different, our preeclamptic cohort did tend to 
have slightly elevated total cholesterol, low-density lipopro-
tein, and body mass index compared with our control group, 
and these differences may reflect an increased risk of develop-
ing preeclampsia and may contribute to increased risk of CVD 
postpartum. Classical CVD risk factors, such as hypertension,57 
obesity,58 and hyperlipidemia,59 have all been implicated in the 
development of preeclampsia and elevated CVD risk postpar-
tum. Recent evidence suggests that women who have had pre-
eclampsia demonstrate increased cardiovascular reactivity to 
sympathetic stressors, which may also contribute to increased 
risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.60 Overall, our 
data indicate that angiotensin II sensitivity is increased and 
contributes to impaired microvascular function in otherwise 
healthy women who have had preeclampsia; however, addi-
tional contributing mechanisms should not be discounted.
Perspectives
The clinical symptoms of preeclampsia (high blood pressure, 
proteinuria, edema, etc) typically resolve within 12 weeks post-
partum. However, our data demonstrate that despite this absence

of clinical CVD symptoms, otherwise healthy women who have 
had preeclampsia demonstrate attenuated endothelium-depen-
dent dilation and augmented angiotensin II sensitivity postpar-
tum, indicating the need for early intervention. Given that women 
who have had preeclampsia have a greater sensitivity to angio-
tensin II and that local AT1R inhibition rescues microvascular 
endothelium-dependent vasodilation in these women, systemic 
AT1R inhibition may be a mechanistically specific intervention 
strategy to improve endothelial function and slow or prevent the 
development of clinical CVD in this at-risk population.

What Is New?
• Women who have had a preeclamptic pregnancy have reduced vasodila-
tor function in their microvessels even after their blood pressure has 
returned to normal.
• These women also have increased vasoconstriction of the microvessels 
in response to angiotensin II.
• When we inhibit the actions of angiotensin II, we improve vasodilator 
function in these patients.
What Is Relevant?
• Women who have had preeclampsia are more likely to develop and die 
of cardiovascular diseases.
• Inhibiting the actions of angiotensin II may be an effective strategy to 
prevent the development of cardiovascular disease in these women.
Summary
Our study suggests that vessel function remains altered postpar-
tum in women who have had preeclampsia and provides evidence 
that inhibiting angiotensin II receptors may improve vessel function 
in these patients.
