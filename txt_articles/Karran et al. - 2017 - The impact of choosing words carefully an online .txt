ABSTRACT
Background. Low back pain clinical practice guidelines consistently recommend
against the routine ordering of spinal imaging; however, imaging is frequently requested
in primary care, without evidence of benefit. Imaging reports frequently identify
degenerative features which are likely to be interpreted as ‘abnormal’, despite their
high prevalence in symptom-free individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate
whether post-imaging back-related perceptions are influenced by providing prior
information about normal findings, and to compare the effect of receiving imaging
results with best practice care (without imaging). The impact of introducing novel,
‘enhanced’ reporting strategies was also explored.
Methods. This study was a simulated-patient, randomised, multiple-arm experiment.
Patient scenarios were presented to volunteer healthy adult participants via an online
survey. In the scenarios, ‘virtual’ patients with low back pain were randomised to one of
three groups. Group 1 received imaging and was pre-informed about normal findings.
Group 2 received imaging (without pre-information). Group 3 received best practice
care: quality information without imaging. Group 1 was further divided to receive
either a standard report, or an ‘enhanced’ report (containing altered terminology and
epidemiological information). The primary outcome was back-related perceptions
(BRP), a composite score derived from three numeric rating scale scores exploring
perceptions of spinal condition, recovery concerns and planned activity. The secondary
outcomes were satisfaction and kinesiophobia.
Results. Full data were available from 660 participants (68% female). Analysis of
covariance revealed a significant effect of group after controlling for baseline BRP scores
(F(2,74) = 10.4,p < 0.001,η2
p = .04). Pairwise comparisons indicated that receiving
best practice care resulted in more positive BRPs than receiving imaging results, and
receiving prior information about normal findings had no impact. Enhanced reporting
strategies also positively impacted BRPs (F(1,275) = 13.06,p < 0.001,η2
p = .05).
Significant relationships between group allocation and both satisfaction (F(2,553) =
7.5,p = 0.001,η2
p = .03) and kinaesiophobia (F(2,553) = 3.0,p = 0.050,η2
p = .01) were
found, with statistically significant pairwise comparisions again in favour of best-
practice care.

 Conclusion. Intervention strategies such as enhanced reporting methods and the
provision of quality information (without imaging) have the potential to improve the
outcome of patients with recent-onset LBP and should be further considered by primary

INTRODUCTION
Low back pain (LBP) is a highly prevalent condition which is most often self-limiting and
does not require investigations (Maher, Underwood & Buchbinder, 2016). Current clinical
practice guidelines for the management of recent-onset LBP outline specific circumstances
in which spinal imaging should be considered (Chou et al., 2011; Koes et al., 2010)—but
otherwise recommend against routine imaging. Despite this guideline consensus, spinal
imaging is frequently requested by primary care providers (Dagenais, Galloway & Roffey,
2014; Williams et al., 2010); most often inappropriately (Emery et al., 2013) and without
evidence of benefit (Chou et al., 2009).
General Practitioners (GP)s order spinal imaging for reasons including insufficient
time to discuss the risks and benefits of scans, concerns regarding their vulnerability for
malpractice and a desire to meet patient expectations (Sears et al., 2016). Imaging is also
often requested for the purpose of providing patients with reassurance (Howard & Wessely,
1996). In principle, providing reassurance to patients presenting to primary care with
recent-onset low back pain is a consistent recommendation in care guidelines (Koes et al.,
2010). However, while there is evidence for the reassuring value of medical investigations
for some conditions (Devcich et al., 2012; Howard et al., 2005), the reassuring potential of
imaging for patients with LBP has not been demonstrated (Rolfe & Burton, 2013).
The failure of spinal imaging to reduce patient concern is hardly surprising when the
high prevalence of degenerative changes observed on the scans of asymptomatic adults
is considered (Brinjikji et al., 2014). Descriptions of these ‘normal’ changes in imaging
reports (using terms suggestive of structural deterioration) are likely to have unwarranted
and unnecessary effects on patient perceptions and behaviour (Sloan & Walsh, 2010).
In 1998, Roland & Van Tulder (1998) suggested that: ‘‘Radiologists must take some
responsibility for the way their reports are used and interpreted’’ (p. 230) in order
to reduce the potential for harmful mis interpretation of imaging findings. A recent
study (McCullough et al., 2012) has retrospectively examined the effect of including
epidemiological information (i.e., a statement reporting the prevalence rates of common
imaging findings in asymptomatic adults) alongside lumbar MRI reports, with some
promising indications. Also of interest is evidence that providing patients with information
about normal cardiac test results—prior to their receipt of their own results—may optimise
the reassuring potential of normal test findings (Petrie et al., 2007).
In this online study, we investigated varied approaches to imaging reporting and their
influence on patient perceptions regarding the condition of their back, concerns about

 recovery and plans to engage in activity. We also compared the reassuring value of receiving
spinal imaging with the delivery of quality information without imaging, consistent with
guideline-based ‘best practice’ care.
The primary aims of this study were:
i. To investigate whether post-imaging back-related perceptions are influenced by the
provision of prior information about normal findings;
ii. To compare the effect of receiving imaging results with the effect of receiving best
practice care that does not include imaging.
The secondary aims of this study were:
i. To investigate the effect of receiving imaging results compared to best practice care
(that does not include imaging) on kinesiophobia;
ii. To investigate whether patients with back pain who receive best practice care from
their GP are as satisfied as those who receive spinal imaging;
iii. To compare back-related perceptions following standard reporting of imaging findings
with back-related perceptions following ‘enhanced’ reporting.
METHODS
This study was approved by the University of South Australia Human Research Ethics
Committee (ID 0000035363). A study protocol was registered on Open Science Framework
prior to completion of data collection (https://osf.io/4axy6/). Any deviations from that
protocol are noted in this manuscript. The reporting of this study is consistent (wherever
possible) with the CONSORT 2010 checklist (http://www.consort-statement.org/).
Design and overview
We used a simulated patient, 3-armed, randomised online experiment to investigate the
impact of varied imaging reporting strategies and GP-delivered best practice care on patient
cognitions, planned behaviour and satisfaction with healthcare. Adult volunteers were
presented with an age-matched hypothetical patient scenario and requested to respond to
survey questions as if they were the patient described. Participants were randomly allocated
to the three study groups (via the survey software randomisation feature) and blinded to
conditions other than their own.
Participants
We recruited participants via an online strategy involving email (using personal and
professional networks of the authors), social media and website advertising. Participants
were invited to ‘‘opt-in’’ to the study by following a link to the study information and
confirmed consent through voluntarily commencing the survey. Individuals were eligible
for inclusion if they were aged over 18 years and had sufficient English language proficiency
to complete the questionnaire.
Procedure
Participants used their personal computers or smartphones to access the survey via
web-based survey software. They completed a 4–item demographic questionnaire and six

baseline screening questions, and were provided with a scenario describing a person who
injures their back while lifting. Participants were asked to imagine that they were person
described in the scenario as they completed the baseline primary outcome measures. The
scenario was developed to describe the person’s concern about their slow recovery (three
weeks later) and their decision to go to see their GP. Participants were randomly allocated
to three groups:
i. A scan is recommended and the GP provides information about normal scan findings;
ii. A scan is recommended (but no information about normal findings is provided);
iii. The GP provides best practice care (and does not recommend a scan).
Patients who received a scan were further randomised to a type of reporting strategy
as detailed in Fig. 1. All participants then completed the primary and secondary outcome
measures. Details of the manipulations (and examples) are provided in Supplemental
Information 1.
Measures
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was a composite score derived from three numeric rating
scale (NRS) responses (see Supplemental Information 2). The summed outcome score
was labelled the Back-Related Perceptions (BRP) score, with higher scores indicating more
positive perceptions. We considered that ‘patient’ reassurance (reduced fear and concern)
would be reflected by higher BRP scores. Reassurance is variably defined and measured; we
considered that a change in reassurance would be more likely to be detected by a composite
outcome measure than a single NRS question.
The two secondary outcome measures were the Tampa Scale of Kinesphobia (TSK-
11) (Tkachuk & Harris, 2012) and a patient satisfaction rating (see Supplemental
Information 3).

 Demographics and baseline screening
Self-report data were collected on age, gender, country of residence, language, and education
level attained. Participants completed the Back Pain Attitudes Questionnaire (Darlow et
al., 2014) (at baseline) and were asked to indicate ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ responses to questions
relating to previous back pain, recent back pain, current ‘chronic’ back pain and history of
back scans.
Data analysis
Sample size calculation
The study was powered to detect a small effect size, (Cohen, 1998) with a power of 80%
and an alpha value of 0.05. Assuming a correlation 0.7, the minimum sample size required
for each of the three groups was 195 participants.
Statistical analysis plan
To address each of the primary research aims an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was
conducted to determine if there was a significant effect of group on the primary outcome
(BRP scores) after controlling for the effect of baseline BRP scores. Tukey corrected
post-hoc pairwise comparisons (with bootstrapped significance and confidence intervals)
investigated whether there was a significant difference between the best practice group and
either (or both) of the imaging groups, and between the two imaging groups.
To address the secondary research aims (i) and (ii) we performed one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) to determine the relationship between the group variable and the
secondary outcome measures. If a significant effect was identified, Tukey’s post-hoc tests
with Bonferroni correction were conducted to identify the between-group differences.
To address secondary research aim (iii) we used ANCOVA to investigate whether there
was a significant effect of group after controlling for the effect of baseline BRP scores. The
level of significance for this sub-study was set at P ≤ 0.025 to adjust for multiple compar-
isons. The level of significance for all other studies was set at P ≤ 0.05. Statistical analyses
was undertaken using SPSS Statistics software (v22.0.0.0, IBM Corporation, New York).

significant difference in BRP between the 2 groups who received scans (p = 0.202). For both
of the significant comparisons, mean BRP scores (indicating more positive perceptions)
were higher for the group who received best practice care.

One-way ANOVA revealed a significant relationship between group and kinesiophobia

difference between the ‘no pre-information’ group and the ‘best practice’ group (p = 0.044,

practice care.
There was a significant relationship between group and satisfaction ratings (F(2,553) =

p = .03). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences
between the ‘no pre-information’ group and the ‘best practice’ group (p = 0.009, d = .34),

There was a significant effect of group on BRP after controlling for the effect of baseline
BRP scores (F(1,275) = 13.06,p < 0.001,η2

who received enhanced reporting.
The individual effects of the two components of enhanced reporting were also
examined. When compared with standard reporting, the effect of altering the summary
terminology (alone) was significant (F(1,221) = 7.70,p = 0.006,η2
p = .03) as was the effect
of both altering the summary terminology and including epidemiological information
(F(1,207) = 8.40,p = 0.004,η2
p = .04). There was no statistically significant difference
between the two versions of enhanced reporting practices (p = 0.85).

 DISCUSSION
Summary
This investigation examined the impact of novel spinal imaging reporting practices on
‘virtual’ patient BRPs, and provided comparison with best-practice care that does not
include imaging. In summary, receiving high quality information (without imaging)
resulted in more positive BRPs than receiving imaging results, and was associated with
higher satisfaction. Small-to-medium effect sizes indicate the importance of these findings.
For patients who were referred for spinal imaging—altering the terminology of the report
summary and including epidemiological information on the report improved perceptions,
but whether or not information about normal findings was delivered prior to receiving an
imaging report had no impact.
Strengths and limitations
This online study was a novel approach which accessed a large adult population. To our
knowledge it is the first investigation to directly compare the reassuring potential of spinal
imaging with best practice care, and consider the impact of varied reporting strategies in a
randomised design. There are however, some weaknesses with the online scenario-based
study design. Participant engagement in the task and understanding of the questions could
not be monitored. The usefulness of participants imagining that they were the person
described in the scenario is uncertain and issues relating to the reliability and validity of
this approach are not known. Participants may have had difficulty relating to the patient
described, but that 94% reported previous back pain might suggest that they were able to
partially identify with the ‘patient’ experience. Not collecting this information and more
detailed data on participant characteristics were shortcomings of this study.
There may also be limitations related to using the primary outcome measure (BRP)
as a proxy for reassurance, and the identification of patients’ planned behaviour (which
does not offer information about how someone would actually behave in a real situation).
In addition, BRP was an outcome measure developed specifically for this study and has
not undergone psychometric evaluation. This limitation should be considered when
interpreting the strength of this study’s findings.
The potential for recruitment bias associated with using the authors’ networks to recruit
participants was minimised by instructing individuals who were likely to be knowledgeable
about ‘pain’ or ‘imaging’ to not complete the study themselves but to disseminate
the advertisement to uninformed members of their own networks. However, the high
proportion of University educated participants (80%) suggests that the study population
is not representative of the general population. The supposed higher health literacy and
cognitive ability of study participants is likely to have impacted their interpretation of
information and may limit study generalisability.
Relevance to existing literature
Previous studies have suggested that diagnostic tests for some conditions can offer
reassurance, but evidence for the reassuring value of imaging for LBP has been lacking.
This study cautiously supports that spinal imaging results—at least when reported in
Karran et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4151
8/12
 a ‘standard’ fashion—are not in themselves reassuring. Findings are also consistent
with recent indications that adopting ‘enhanced’ reporting practices (such as including
epidemiological information) can offer benefit (McCullough et al., 2012) and supports the
view of Roland & Van Tulder (1998) that attention to the content and language of spinal
imaging reports is warranted. A current randomised trial investigating the inclusion of
epidemiological information in lumbar spine imaging reports is likely to further inform
the need for practice change (Jarvik et al., 2015).
Implications
The findings of this study have the potential to beneficially inform future health care
delivery. General Practitioners are likely to be able to reassure patients with recent-onset
LBP more effectively if they offer carefully considered information than if they order a
scan. This finding challenges the frequent belief that spinal imaging (for patients with
a low likelihood of serious pathology) offers opportunity to alleviate patients’ fears and
concerns (Howard & Wessely, 1996; Rolfe & Burton, 2013). Further to this, the suggestion
that patients are also likely to be more satisfied with this approach offers that avoidance of
a scan is likely to be readily accepted by patients if high-quality information is provided.
It is worthwhile acknowledging that this study did not investigate the effect of offering
both scans and information. This approach—which is probably common in clinical
practice—should be addressed in future studies.
Kinaesiophobia was found to be lower for the ‘best practice’ group than for the ‘no pre-
information’ group; however, a four-point decrease in TSK-11 scores has been suggested
to be required to reflect a clinically important reduction in fear of movement (Woby et al.,
2005). The two-point between-group difference observed in this study, while statistically
significant, may not represent a meaningful difference. Further, although our randomised
design and a priori sample size justified not collecting baseline TSK scores, and the BPAQ
data showed no difference between groups on that measure at baseline, the between-group
differences for TSK and for patient satisfaction were small and we cannot completely
eliminate the possibility that they reflect baseline differences. As such, they should be
interpreted with caution.
This exploratory study suggests that simply offering best practice care is indeed likely
to be effective management for recent-onset LBP. That LBP outcomes are not, in general,
improving may indicate limited application of the current recommendations or a need
to offer clinicians further guidance regarding the provision of quality information. We
consider that the information provided to participants in this study (see Supplemental
Information 1.) (guided by current literature (TOP, 2015; NICE, 2016; Moseley &
Butler, 2015; Stochkendahl et al., 2017; Traeger et al., 2017)) may not represent routine
management and that the potential to improve best practice care currently exists.
This study also suggests that dedicating further attention to the content of spinal imaging
reports is likely to be worthwhile. Providing explanations of ‘normal’ age-related features,
carefully adapting summary terminology and accurately interpreting imaging findings
offer the potential to positively impact patients’ beliefs and concerns, and their subsequent
engagement in activity.
