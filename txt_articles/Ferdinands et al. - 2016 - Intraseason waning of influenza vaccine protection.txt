Background. Recent studies suggest that influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) may wane over the course of an influenza season, 
leading to suboptimal VE during late influenza seasons.
Methods. We examined the association between influenza VE and time since vaccination among patients ≥9 years old with 
medically attended acute respiratory illness in the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network using data pooled from the 2011–
2012 through 2014–2015 influenza seasons. We used multivariate logistic regression with polymerase chain reaction–confirmed 
influenza infection as the outcome and vaccination status defined by days between vaccination and symptom onset as the predictor. 
Models were adjusted for calendar time and other potential confounding factors.
Results. We observed decreasing VE with increasing time since vaccination for influenza A(H3N2) (P = .004), influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 (P = .01), and influenza B viruses (P = .04). Maximum VE was observed shortly after vaccination, followed by 
a decline in VE of about 7% (absolute) per month for influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B and 6%–11% per month for influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. VE remained greater than zero for at least 6 months for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B and 
at least 5 months for influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Decline in VE was more pronounced among patients with prior-season influenza 
vaccination. A similar pattern of increasing influenza risk with increasing time since vaccination was seen in analyses limited to 
vaccinees.
Conclusions. We observed decreasing influenza vaccine protection with increasing time since vaccination across influenza 
types/subtypes. This association is consistent with intraseason waning of host immunity, but bias or residual confounding could 
explain these findings.

The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices recommends that US residents aged ≥6 months receive 
annual influenza vaccination by October of each year to allow 
sufficient time for development of immune protection prior 
to onset of influenza activity [1, 2]. During the past 18 years 
(excluding the pandemic influenza season of 2009–2010), the 
annual influenza season in the United States typically began in 
December or early January, as defined by the first week in which 
the number of influenza cases contributed ≥2% of cumulative 
influenza cases during the season among specimens tested by 
World Health Organization and US collaborating laboratories. 
However, early or late starts to the influenza season were not 
uncommon: In 3 seasons, the influenza season started by the 
beginning of December, and in 3 seasons, the influenza season 
started in or later than the third week of January. Duration of 
the annual influenza epidemic averaged about 13 weeks, with 
some seasons lasting as long as 17 weeks [3].
Influenza vaccine is often available in the United States by 
the end of July [4]. The early availability of influenza vaccine 
and late arrival of the 2011–2012 influenza season prompted 
questions about the potential for intraseason waning of influ-
enza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Several studies of influenza VE 
in Europe suggested that vaccinated persons more often pre-
sented later in the 2011–2012 season, an observation consistent 
with intraseason waning of influenza VE [5–8]. Evidence for 
intraseason waning of effectiveness of the 2011–2012 south-
ern hemisphere influenza vaccine was equivocal in Australia, 
which did not experience a late influenza epidemic that year [9]. 
In the following season (2012–2013) in the United Kingdom, 
Andrews et al observed a pattern of lower VE with longer time 
since vaccination, but the finding was not statistically signif-
icant [10]. A pooled analysis of 5 recent influenza seasons in

Europe found evidence of moderate waning of VE against influ-
enza A(H3N2), mild waning of VE against influenza B, and no 
evidence of waning of VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
virus infection [11].
In this analysis, we examined the association between effec-
tiveness of influenza vaccine and time since receipt of influ-
enza vaccine among enrollees in the US Influenza VE Network 
case-control study of influenza VE for the 2011–2012 through 
2014–2015 influenza seasons.
METHODS
The US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network has been 
described previously [12, 13]. Adults and children seeking out-
patient care for acute respiratory illnesses were enrolled at 5 
locations in the United States (Seattle, Washington; Marshfield, 
Wisconsin; Southeast Michigan; Temple, Texas; and Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania) after influenza circulation was confirmed by local 
surveillance. Patients aged ≥6 months were eligible if they had 
illness with cough (in 2012–2013 through 2014–2015) or cough 
and/or fever/feverishness (in 2011–2012) of ≤7 days’ duration. 
Consented patients were interviewed and provided throat and 
nasal swab specimens tested for influenza virus at Network lab-
oratories with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) with primers, probes, and testing protocols pro-
vided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 
this “test-negative case-control” study, patients who tested positive 
for influenza were cases and patients who tested negative were the 
control group. Subjects were considered vaccinated if they had 
documented evidence in medical records or immunization reg-
istries of receipt of ≥1 dose of influenza vaccine for the current 
influenza season at least 14 days before illness onset.
Here, we examined the association between influenza VE 
and time since vaccination using data pooled from 4 influenza 
seasons and multivariate logistic regression models with PCR-
confirmed outpatient influenza infection as the outcome and 
time between vaccination and symptom onset as the predictor. 
We excluded adults who received >1 dose of influenza vaccine 
in a given season and children ≤9 years of age to avoid difficulty 
introduced by receipt of 2 influenza vaccine doses at variable 
times within a single season. We excluded controls enrolled 
prior to the first case for each type/subtype-specific analysis. 
The analysis of VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 excluded 
the 2014–2015 season, during which <5 cases were enrolled.
To examine variation in VE associated with time since vac-
cination rather than variation associated with any receipt of 
influenza vaccine, the model included both a term for receipt 
of influenza vaccine at any time at least 14 days prior to illness 
onset and a variable representing number of days between vac-
cination and illness onset specified as a natural cubic spline 
(details are shown in the Supplementary Data). We excluded 
subjects with vaccination between 0 and 13 days before illness 
onset for 2 reasons. First, immunologic studies suggest that 
14 days is needed to mount an immune response to vaccina-
tion, and thus exposure status is effectively unknown during 
the period from 0 to 13 days after vaccination. Second, initial 
models that included subjects vaccinated 0–13 days prior to 
illness were unstable, with the direction of the spline unpredict-
able and contrary to the pattern suggested by studies of post-
vaccination antibody titers. To specify the spline representing 
time between vaccination and onset, we selected the number 
and placement of internal knots to maximize goodness of fit (by 
lowest Akaike information criterion) and best characterize the 
association between VE and time since vaccination assuming 
no functional form (Supplementary Data). If 2 or more splines 
fit the data equally well, we chose the more parsimonious. 
Unvaccinated individuals were the reference group. Variation 
in VE associated with time since vaccination was tested using 
a likelihood ratio test comparing a model including the spline 
terms representing time since vaccination and a dichotomous 
indicator of receipt of influenza vaccine receipt at any time at 
least 14 days prior to illness onset to a nested model excluding 
the spline terms. Because controls tended to have later onset 
than influenza A cases and earlier onset than influenza B cases, 
we restricted each pooled dataset to cases and 3–4 controls per 
case matched on onset date percentile (Supplementary Data). 
This restriction substantially improved balance between cases 
and controls on this confounding factor. Multivariate (uncon-
ditional) logistic regression models using the restricted datasets 
produced substantively similar results to models using exact 
case:control matching on onset date analyzed with conditional 
logistic regression and were preferred for computational ease.
We tested for 2-way interactions (effect modification) 
between time since vaccination and (i) age group and (ii) pri-
or-season influenza vaccination status. Prior-season vaccina-
tion was defined as documented receipt of influenza vaccine in 
the immediately preceding influenza season. We examined the 
primary association for 3 time periods: the full study period, 
the earlier half of the study period (prior to and including the 
median influenza case onset date), and the latter half of the 
study period (after the median case onset date). In addition, 
we examined the association between influenza positivity and 
time since vaccination in models limited to vaccinees. To min-
imize misclassification of influenza status, study eligibility was 
limited to patients presenting to care within 7 days of illness 
onset and all eligible patients were tested by highly sensitive 
PCR. Analyses were conducted using R software version 3.3.0 
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and 
SAS software version 9.3 (Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
The number and temporal distribution of influenza cases varied 
substantially across the 4 seasons (study enrollment prior to data-
set restriction is shown in Figure 1). Median case onset ranged 
from the first week of January in 2014–2015 to the first week

of March in 2011–2012. After exclusions and restrictions, the 
pooled analytic datasets included 11 200 observations for analysis 
of VE against influenza A(H3N2), 4100 observations for analysis 
of VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 5525 observations 
for analysis of VE against influenza B virus infection.
Age and sex distributions significantly differed for influenza 
cases and test-negative controls within each type/subtype anal-
ysis (Table 1). Median subject age was 41 years in the influenza 
A analyses and 39 years in the influenza B analysis. Compared 
with influenza B cases, controls were older (P < .001). Compared 
with influenza cases of all type/subtypes, controls were more 
likely to be female (P < .05), to report poor health (P < .001), 
and to have received influenza vaccine (P ≤ .002). Median inter-
val between vaccination and symptom onset was 95, 94, and 
117 days for the influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and B 
virus analyses, respectively.
Adjusted VE against influenza A(H3N2) virus infection 
decreased with increasing time since vaccination, with maximum 
VE of 35% at 14 days postvaccination, and VE reaching zero at 
158 days postvaccination (Figure 2A; P = .004). Approximating 
this decline in VE as linear is equivalent to approximately a 7% 
(absolute) decline in VE per 30 days. Adjusted VE without 
including time since vaccination in the model was 24% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 15%–32%). In a model limited to 
vaccinees, predicted risk of influenza A(H3N2) virus infection 
increased with time since vaccination (Figure 2B; P = .001).
Adjusted VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection 
decreased with increasing time since vaccination, with maximum 
VE of 80% at 14 days postvaccination and minimum VE of 37% 
at 128 days postvaccination; estimated VE was 46% at 180 days 
postvaccination (Figure 3A; P = .01). Approximating this decline 
as linear is equivalent to a 6%–11% decline in VE per 30 days, 
comparing maximum observed VE to VE observed at 180 days 
postvaccination or to minimum observed VE, respectively. 
Adjusted VE without including time since vaccination in the 
model was 48% (95% CI, 36%–58%). In a model limited to vac-
cinees, predicted risk of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infec-
tion increased with time since vaccination (Figure 3B; P = .04).
Adjusted VE against influenza B virus infection decreased with 
increasing time since vaccination, with maximum VE of 59% 
at 14 days postvaccination and minimum VE of 23% at 180 days 
postvaccination (Figure 4A; P = .04). Approximating this decline 
as linear is equivalent to approximately a 7% decline in VE per 
30 days. Adjusted VE without including time since vaccination in 
the model was 45% (95% CI, 33%–54%). In a model limited to vac-
cinees, predicted risk of influenza B virus infection increased with 
time since vaccination, but this result was not statistically significant 
(Figure 4B; P = .33). The observed decline in VE against influenza 
A(H3N2) virus infection with longer time since vaccination was 
more pronounced for subjects with onset later in the study period 
(P = .008 for interaction); however, this pattern was inconsistent 
across types/subtypes (Supplementary Figures 4–9). We observed

no interaction between time since vaccination and age group for 
any type/subtype, although among subjects <60 years old there 
was a trend toward higher VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
and lower VE against influenza B virus infection (Supplementary 
Figures 10–15). We observed an interaction between prior-season 
vaccination and time since vaccination for VE against each type/
subtype, with the decline in VE with increasing time since vaccina-
tion more pronounced among subjects with prior-season vaccina-
tion (P = .04, P = .006, and P = .01 for influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)
pdm09, and B virus infection, respectively; Supplementary Figures 
16–21). Season-specific results are presented in the Supplementary 
Data for seasons and influenza types/subtypes with at least 30 vacci-
nated cases (Supplementary Figures 22–27).
DISCUSSION
In combined data from 4 recent US influenza seasons, we observed 
a decrease in effectiveness of influenza vaccine with increas-
ing time since vaccination for influenza A(H3N2), influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B virus infections. Maximum VE 
was observed shortly after vaccination, followed by a decline in 
VE of about 7% per month for influenza A(H3N2) and influenza 
B and 6%–11% per month for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus 
infections. VE remained greater than zero for at least 6 months 
for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B and at least 
5 months for influenza A(H3N2) virus infection. This finding is 
similar to several reports that suggested waning effectiveness for 
the influenza A(H3N2) vaccine component observed in Europe,

although our results showed a somewhat less pronounced rate 
of decline. Unlike a recent study of 5 pooled European influenza 
seasons [11], we observed similar rates of decline in VE across 
types/subtypes, including for VE against influenza B viruses. Our 
findings for influenza A(H3N2) viruses are consistent with those 
of Belongia et al [14] and Petrie et al [15], who observed mod-
est but detectable waning of influenza VE during the influenza 
A(H3N2)–predominant 2007–2008 US season.
In our study, the observed decline in VE with longer time 
since vaccination was more pronounced among subjects with 
prior-season influenza vaccination. Human serologic studies 
suggest that repeat vaccination may blunt the antibody response 
to influenza vaccine [16–19], but the immunologic relationship 
between prior- and current-season vaccination and the influence 
of age and history of natural influenza infection on that relation-
ship are poorly understood. Observational studies of repeat vac-
cination have demonstrated residual protection from influenza 
vaccination received more than a year prior [12, 13, 20], con-
sistent with a mild or moderate, but not pronounced, decline of 
vaccine protection over the course of an influenza season.
Studies of the serologic persistence of antibodies to influenza 
hemagglutinin among both elderly and healthy young adults found 
that seroprotection, if initially attained after vaccination, typically 
persisted for ≥4 months for the influenza A(H3N2) component 
of the vaccine [21–26]. A person vaccinated early in a late-arriv-
ing influenza season could face an elapsed time of 6–7 months 
between vaccination and peak of influenza circulation, and there 
are too few studies to draw firm conclusions about persistence of 
host seroprotection over that time span. However, a randomized 
study of antibody persistence in healthy adults found that it took 
>58 weeks for geometric mean antibody titers to decrease 2-fold 
following vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine [21], 
and that this decrease in antibody titers was paralleled by a slow 
decrease in vaccine efficacy [15]. Overall, human serologic stud-
ies appear consistent with a modest rather than a sharp decline in 
influenza vaccine protection within a given season.
Alternative explanations for an observed decline in vaccine 
protection during an influenza season include emergence and 
circulation of a drifted variant less well-matched to the vaccine 
strain, as was observed in 2011–2012 in Europe, confounding by 
factors associated with both timing of vaccine receipt and likeli-
hood of being influenza positive (for example, if cases presenting 
sooner after vaccination differ from other cases), bias introduced 
by changes in the composition of the at-risk population over the

course of the season [27–29], and bias arising from the so-called 
leaky vaccine effect [30, 31]. With the latter 2 situations, there 
may appear to be a decline in vaccine protection because unvac-
cinated individuals, who have a higher risk for infection (assum-
ing vaccine confers at least some benefit), become infected and 
exit the at-risk population sooner, leaving proportionally more 
vaccinated individuals in the at-risk population over the course 
of the season, ultimately leading to vaccinated cases being over-
represented later in the season. Bias due to heterogeneity of the 
at-risk population and the leaky vaccine effect cannot be ruled 
out as causes of the decline in VE that we observed; however, 
models restricted to vaccinees, in which these biases would be 
expected to be less pronounced, gave similar results.
Although we attempted to control for characteristics associ-
ated with a tendency to be vaccinated earlier (such as age and 
presence of underlying health conditions), it is possible that the 
observed pattern of decreasing vaccine protection arose from 
uncontrolled confounding. It was particularly challenging to 
control for calendar time, and the trend toward steeper decline 
in VE observed in the later study period may reflect residual 
confounding by time. Small sample sizes required that we pool 
data across influenza seasons, which could have obscured sea-
son-by-season differences and necessitated the use of percen-
tile of onset date rather than calendar date of onset to adjust 
for calendar time. Finally, VE estimated at the extremes of the 
range of time since vaccination were sensitive to the choice of 
spline specifying time since vaccination. Typically, the spline 
function tended to slightly overestimate VE at the early end of 
the range and underestimate VE at the late end of the range. 
For this reason, values at the extremes should be interpreted 
with caution.
There is no established method for modeling the association 
between VE and time since vaccination, and how best to exam-
ine the question of duration of VE remains a challenge. One 
possibility is a trial in which vaccine recipients are randomized 
to receive vaccine at different points in time prior to influenza 
season, similar to a “step wedge” design [32]. However, even 
randomized trials can be prone to biases that give the illusion 
of waning VE in the absence of such a phenomenon [27, 30, 
31]. A definitive observational study is unlikely to be feasible, 
given it would require a large cohort in which influenza VE is 
measured at multiple time points during a season with data suf-
ficiently rich to describe time-varying influenza exposure pat-
terns and allow discrimination between putative mechanisms of 
vaccine action (ie, all-or-none vs leaky vaccine models).
Influenza seasons vary considerably in length, severity, and 
arrival time, and although vaccine is now available earlier, there 
is little evidence that large numbers of people in the United States 
are getting vaccinated considerably earlier than has previously 
occurred [33]. Evidence for intraseason waning of influenza vac-
cine protection is growing but inconsistent [5–10, 13, 15]. The 
possibility of waning VE merits further investigation; however, 
the current uncertainty in its nature and magnitude makes draw-
ing conclusions difficult and suggests that careful consideration 
of the risks and benefits of delaying vaccination is needed before 
contemplating changes to current vaccine recommendations.
