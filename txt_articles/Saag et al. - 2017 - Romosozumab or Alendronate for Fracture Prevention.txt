BACKGROUND
Romosozumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits sclerostin, 
increases bone formation, and decreases bone resorption.
METHODS
We enrolled 4093 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and a fragility fracture 
and randomly assigned them in a 1:1 ratio to receive monthly subcutaneous romo-
sozumab (210 mg) or weekly oral alendronate (70 mg) in a blinded fashion for 12 
months, followed by open-label alendronate in both groups. The primary end points 
were the cumulative incidence of new vertebral fracture at 24 months and the cumu-
lative incidence of clinical fracture (nonvertebral and symptomatic vertebral fracture) 
at the time of the primary analysis (after clinical fractures had been confirmed in 
≥330 patients). Secondary end points included the incidences of nonvertebral and hip 
fracture at the time of the primary analysis. Serious cardiovascular adverse events, 
osteonecrosis of the jaw, and atypical femoral fractures were adjudicated.
RESULTS
Over a period of 24 months, a 48% lower risk of new vertebral fractures was observed 
in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group (6.2% [127 of 2046 patients]) than in the 
alendronate-to-alendronate group (11.9% [243 of 2047 patients]) (P<0.001). Clinical 
fractures occurred in 198 of 2046 patients (9.7%) in the romosozumab-to-alendro-
nate group versus 266 of 2047 patients (13.0%) in the alendronate-to-alendronate 
group, representing a 27% lower risk with romosozumab (P<0.001). The risk of 
nonvertebral fractures was lower by 19% in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group 
than in the alendronate-to-alendronate group (178 of 2046 patients [8.7%] vs. 217 
of 2047 patients [10.6%]; P 
= 
0.04), and the risk of hip fracture was lower by 38% 
(41 of 2046 patients [2.0%] vs. 66 of 2047 patients [3.2%]; P 
= 
0.02). Overall adverse 
events and serious adverse events were balanced between the two groups. During 
year 1, positively adjudicated serious cardiovascular adverse events were observed 
more often with romosozumab than with alendronate (50 of 2040 patients [2.5%] vs. 
38 of 2014 patients [1.9%]). During the open-label alendronate period, adjudicated 
events of osteonecrosis of the jaw (1 event each in the romosozumab-to-alendronate 
and alendronate-to-alendronate groups) and atypical femoral fracture (2 events and 
4 events, respectively) were observed.
CONCLUSIONS
In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who were at high risk for fracture, ro-
mosozumab treatment for 12 months followed by alendronate resulted in a signifi-
cantly lower risk of fracture than alendronate alone. (Funded by Amgen and others;

F
ragility fractures are common and 
increase morbidity and mortality.1,2 Romo-
sozumab (Amgen and UCB Pharma) is a new 
bone-forming monoclonal antibody that binds to 
and inhibits sclerostin, with a dual effect of in-
creasing bone formation and decreasing bone 
resorption.3,4
In a randomized, controlled trial,5 1 year of 
romosozumab treatment was associated with 
significantly lower risks of new vertebral fracture 
and clinical fracture (a composite of nonvertebral 
fracture and symptomatic vertebral fracture) than 
placebo among postmenopausal women with os-
teoporosis. That trial excluded patients with se-
vere osteoporosis and thus enrolled a relatively 
low-risk population.6-10 In that context, the risk of 
nonvertebral fracture was not significantly lower 
with romosozumab than with placebo.
Alendronate is an antiresorptive agent com-
monly used as first-line therapy for osteoporosis. 
In a trial involving postmenopausal women with 
prevalent fractures, the risks of vertebral and clini-
cal (in particular, hip) fractures were lower with 
alendronate than with placebo.10
There are few head-to-head studies of osteo-
porosis therapy with fracture end points, and only 
one trial evaluating bone-building versus anti-
resorptive therapy was designed with fracture as 
the primary end point.11 In the Active-Controlled 
Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women with 
Osteoporosis at High Risk (ARCH), we compared 
the effectiveness of a treatment regimen starting 
with romosozumab and transitioning to alendro-
nate with alendronate treatment alone in reduc-
ing the risk of fracture among postmenopausal 
women with osteoporosis and a previous fracture.
Methods
Trial Design
In this phase 3, multicenter, international, ran-
domized, double-blind trial, women were ran-
domly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of an 
interactive voice-response system, to receive 
monthly subcutaneous romosozumab (210 mg) 
or weekly oral alendronate (Merck; 70 mg) for 12 
months (Fig. 1). Randomization was stratified 
according to age (<75 vs. ≥75 years). After com-
pletion of the double-blind trial period, all the 
patients received open-label weekly oral alendro-
nate (70 mg) until the end of the trial, with blind-
ing to the initial treatment assignment main-
tained. Patients received daily calcium and vitamin 
D, as described previously.5 In this trial designed to 
show the superiority of romosozumab over alen-
dronate, the primary analysis was performed when 
clinical-fracture events had been confirmed in at 
least 330 patients and all the patients had com-
pleted the month 24 visit.
Trial Oversight
The trial protocol, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org, was approved by the ethics 
committee or institutional review board at each 
trial center. Patients provided written informed 
consent before any trial procedures were per-
formed. Amgen and UCB Pharma designed the 
trial, and Amgen was responsible for trial over-
sight and data analyses per a prespecified sta-
tistical analysis plan. An external independent 
data monitoring committee monitored unblind-
ed safety data.
Three authors (one academic author and two 
employees of Amgen) vouch for the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and analyses reported 
and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. All 
the authors had access to the data. The first and 
last authors wrote the first draft of the manu-
script, with medical-writing assistance funded by 
Amgen and UCB Pharma. All the authors contrib-
uted to subsequent drafts and made the decision 
to submit the manuscript for publication. Trial 
investigators signed agreements with the spon-
sors relating to data confidentiality.
Patients
Ambulatory postmenopausal women 55 to 90 years 
of age who met at least one of the following cri-
teria were eligible: a bone mineral density T score 
of –2.5 or less at the total hip or femoral neck and 
either one or more moderate or severe vertebral 
fractures or two or more mild vertebral fractures; 
or a bone mineral density T score of –2.0 or less 
at the total hip or femoral neck and either two 
or more moderate or severe vertebral fractures or 
a fracture of the proximal femur sustained 3 to 
24 months before randomization. Women were 
excluded as described previously5 and for an in-
ability to take alendronate oral tablets or contra-
indications to alendronate, including a glomeru-
lar filtration rate below 35 ml per minute per 
1.73 m2 of body-surface area.

Romosozumab or Alendronate for Fracture Prevention
Procedures
Lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar 
spine were obtained at screening, at months 12 
and 24, and every 12 months thereafter until the 
time of the primary analysis. Radiographs were 
assessed at a central imaging center, as described 
previously, as were nonvertebral fractures (addi-
tional details are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org).5
The bone mineral density at the lumbar spine 
and proximal femur was evaluated by means of 
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar or Ho-
logic) at baseline and every 12 months thereafter; 
in a subgroup of 167 patients, assessment was also 
performed at months 6 and 18. Serum concentra-
tions of the bone-turnover markers β-isomer of 
C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX; 
LabCorp) and procollagen type 1 N-terminal pro-
peptide (P1NP; Covance) were measured in a 
subgroup of 277 patients.
Adverse events were reported by individual trial 
sites. Serious cardiovascular adverse events were 
adjudicated by the Duke Clinical Research Insti-
tute, and potential cases of osteonecrosis of the 
jaw and atypical femoral fracture were adjudicated 
by independent committees. Serum was tested for 
anti-romosozumab antibodies at day 1 and until 
month 24; samples that were positive for binding 
antibodies were assessed for neutralizing anti-
bodies.
Primary and Secondary End Points
The primary end points of this trial were the 
cumulative incidence of new vertebral fracture at 
24 months and the cumulative incidence of clini-
cal fracture (nonvertebral and symptomatic verte-
bral fracture) at the time of the primary analysis. 
Bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, total 
hip, and femoral neck at 12 and 24 months and 
the incidence of nonvertebral fracture at the time 
of the primary analysis were key secondary end 
points. Other fracture categories, including hip 
fracture, were evaluated as additional secondary 
end points.
Figure 1. Trial Schema.
Women were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive 210 mg of romosozumab by subcutaneous injection once 
monthly or 70 mg of alendronate orally every week for 12 months for the double-blind period of the trial, followed 
by open-label alendronate until the time of the primary analysis; the initial treatment assignment remained blinded. 
The primary analysis was performed when events of clinical fracture (nonvertebral and symptomatic vertebral frac-
ture) had been confirmed in at least 330 patients and all the patients had completed the month 24 visit. The median 
follow-up at the time of the primary analysis was 2.7 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 3.3). Bone mineral density was 
assessed at the lumbar spine and proximal femur in all the patients at baseline and every 12 months thereafter, and 
also at months 6 and 18 in a substudy of the total patient population that involved 167 patients. Levels of bone-
turnover markers were assessed at baseline (day 1) and months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, and 36 or until the primary 
analysis, whichever came first, in a subgroup of 277 patients from the total patient population.

Statistical Analysis
The trial was powered to show superiority, with 
94% power to detect a 30% lower risk of clinical 
fracture in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group 
than in the alendronate-to-alendronate group at 
the time of the primary analysis and 95% power 
to detect a 50% lower risk of new vertebral frac-
ture over a period of 24 months. If the differ-
ences in both primary end points were signifi-
cant with the use of the Hochberg procedure,12 a 
fixed-sequence testing procedure was to be used 
for bone mineral density and the key secondary 
end point of nonvertebral fracture to adjust for 
multiple comparisons and to maintain an overall 
significance level of 0.05. The nonvertebral-frac-
ture end point was tested by means of a group 
sequential approach at the time of the primary 
analysis with the use of a Lan–DeMets alpha 
spending function (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). All remaining secondary and explor-
atory efficacy end points were analyzed at a sig-
nificance level of 0.05 (two-sided).
All analyses of treatment effect used an inten-
tion-to-treat approach. Analyses of vertebral-frac-
ture end points included all randomly assigned 
patients with a baseline radiograph and at least 
one radiograph obtained after baseline. When a 
radiograph assessment after baseline was miss-
ing, the status was imputed with the status from 
the last nonmissing visit after baseline. A post 
hoc analysis of vertebral fractures was also per-
formed for all randomly assigned patients with 
the use of a multiple-imputation method that in-
cluded treatment group and the following base-
line variables: age, years since menopause, body-
mass index, number of prevalent vertebral fractures, 
worst vertebral fracture severity, and bone mineral 
density T score at the lumbar spine, total hip, and 
femoral neck.
For the incidence of clinical, nonvertebral, 
major nonvertebral, hip, osteoporotic, symptom-
atic vertebral, and major osteoporotic fractures, 
the treatment groups were compared on the basis 
of a Cox proportional-hazards model with ad-
justment for age (<75 vs. ≥75 years), the presence 
or absence of severe vertebral fracture at baseline, 
and baseline bone mineral density T score at the 
total hip. For the incidence of new vertebral and 
new or worsening vertebral fractures, risk ratios 
were determined by means of the Mantel–Haenszel 
method, with treatment comparison assessed with 
the use of a logistic-regression model with ad-
justment for age (<75 vs. ≥75 years), the presence 
or absence of severe vertebral fracture at baseline, 
and baseline bone mineral density T score at the 
total hip. A total of 11 subgroup categories were 
prespecified and analyzed for treatment-by-sub-
group interactions, as described previously.5
Percentage changes from baseline in bone min-
eral density were assessed in patients who had a 
baseline measurement and at least one measure-
ment after baseline. Between-group comparisons 
of the percentage change from baseline in bone 
mineral density were analyzed by means of a re-
peated-measures model with adjustment for treat-
ment, age category, the presence or absence of 
severe vertebral fracture at baseline, visit, treat-
ment-by-visit interaction, and baseline bone min-
eral density as fixed effects, with machine type and 
interaction between baseline bone mineral den-
sity and machine type as covariates, with the use 
of an unstructured variance–covariance structure. 
Percentage changes from baseline in bone-turn-
over markers were assessed in patients enrolled in 
the biomarker substudy, as described previously.5
The safety analysis included all randomly as-
signed patients who received at least one dose of 
romosozumab or alendronate in the double-blind 
period. Incidence rates at the time of the primary 
analysis were cumulative and included all events 
in the double-blind and open-label periods in pa-
tients who received at least one dose of open-label 
alendronate. Odds ratios and confidence intervals 
were estimated for serious cardiovascular adverse 
events with the use of a logistic-regression model.
Results
Patients
A total of 4093 patients underwent randomiza-
tion; 3654 patients (89.3%) completed 12 months 
of the trial (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix), and 3150 (77.0%) completed the primary 
analysis period. The reasons for discontinuation 
were similar in the two treatment groups (Fig. S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The demographic 
and clinical characteristics of the patients at base-
line were balanced between the two groups (Ta-
ble 1). The mean age of the patients was 74.3 years, 
99.0% had a previous osteoporotic fracture at 45 
years of age or older, 96.1% had a prevalent verte-
bral fracture, and the mean bone mineral density 
T scores were –2.96 at the lumbar spine, –2.80 at 
the total hip, and –2.90 at the femoral neck.

Romosozumab or Alendronate for Fracture Prevention
Efficacy
Fracture
Over a period of 24 months, treatment with ro-
mosozumab followed by alendronate resulted in 
a 48% lower risk of new vertebral fractures than 
alendronate alone (6.2% [127 of 2046 patients] 
vs. 11.9% [243 of 2047 patients]; risk ratio, 0.52; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.66; P<0.001) 
with the use of multiple imputation for missing 
fracture status (Fig. 2A); similarly, a 50% lower 
risk with romosozumab was observed with the 
use of the last observation carried forward (Ta-
ble S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). At the 
time of the primary analysis, romosozumab fol-
lowed by alendronate resulted in a 27% lower risk 
of clinical fracture than alendronate alone (haz-
ard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.88; P<0.001) 
(Fig. 2B). The cumulative incidence of clinical 
fracture in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group 
was 9.7% (198 of 2046 patients) versus 13.0% 
(266 of 2047 patients) in the alendronate-to-
alendronate group.
At the time of the primary analysis, romoso-
zumab followed by alendronate also resulted in a 
19% lower risk of nonvertebral fracture than alen-
dronate alone (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66 to 
0.99; P 
= 
0.04) (Fig. 2C), with fractures occurring 
in 178 of 2046 patients (8.7%) in the romoso-
zumab-to-alendronate group versus 217 of 2047 
patients (10.6%) in the alendronate-to-alendro-
nate group (Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Hip fractures occurred in 41 of 2046 
patients (2.0%) in the romosozumab-to-alendro-
nate group as compared with 66 of 2047 patients 
(3.2%) in the alendronate-to-alendronate group 
at the time of the primary analysis, representing 
a 38% lower risk with romosozumab (hazard ra-
tio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.92; P 
= 
0.02).
Between-group differences in favor of romo-
sozumab were observed by month 12, including 
in new vertebral fractures (risk ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 
0.47 to 0.85) and clinical fractures (hazard ratio, 
0.72; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96). The risk of nonverte-
bral fracture was 26% lower with romosozumab 
than with alendronate, but the difference was not 
significant (P 
= 
0.06). Table S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix shows details of these and other 
fracture end points.
Bone Mineral Density
Patients who received romosozumab had greater 
gains in bone mineral density from baseline at 
all measured sites and at all time points than pa-
tients who received alendronate alone. The differ-
ential greater gains achieved by month 12 with 
romosozumab were maintained at month 36, after 
the transition to alendronate (P<0.001 for all com-
parisons) (Fig. 3A and 3B, and Fig. S3 and Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). In a subgroup 
of patients assessed every 6 months, greater gains 
with romosozumab were observed beginning at 
month 6 (P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Bone-Turnover Markers
Romosozumab increased levels of the bone-for-
mation marker P1NP and decreased levels of the 
bone-resorption marker β-CTX within 12 months 
(Fig. 3C and 3D). After the transition to alendro-
nate, levels of P1NP and β-CTX decreased and 
remained below baseline levels at 36 months. In 
patients receiving alendronate alone, levels of P1NP 
and β-CTX decreased within 1 month and remained 
below baseline levels at 36 months.
Safety
The incidences of adverse events and serious ad-
verse events were similar overall between the two 
treatment groups during the 12-month double-
blind period, and cumulative incidences were 
similar between the two groups during the pri-
mary analysis period (Table 2). In the first 12 
months, injection-site reactions (mostly mild in 
severity) were reported in more patients receiv-
ing romosozumab (90 of 2040 patients [4.4%]) 
than in those receiving alendronate (53 of 2014 
patients [2.6%]).
An imbalance in adjudicated serious cardio-
vascular adverse events was observed during the 
double-blind period, with 50 patients (2.5%) in 
the romosozumab group and 38 (1.9%) in the 
alendronate group reporting these events (odds 
ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.85 to 2.00). A total of 16 
patients (0.8%) in the romosozumab group and 
6 (0.3%) in the alendronate group reported car-
diac ischemic events (odds ratio, 2.65; 95% CI, 
1.03 to 6.77), and 16 patients (0.8%) in the romo-
sozumab group and 7 (0.3%) in the alendronate 
group reported cerebrovascular events (odds ra-
tio, 2.27; 95% CI, 0.93 to 5.22), whereas heart 
failure, noncoronary revascularization, and periph-
eral vascular ischemic events not requiring revas-
cularization were numerically lower in the romo-
sozumab group (Table 2). Cardiovascular risk

Romosozumab or Alendronate for Fracture Prevention
factors in patients with positively adjudicated car-
diovascular events are shown in Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
No adjudicated events of osteonecrosis of the 
jaw or atypical femoral fracture were reported in 
the 12-month double-blind period. During the 
open-label period, 2 events of osteonecrosis of 
the jaw (1 [<0.1%] in each treatment group) and 
6 events of atypical femoral fracture (2 [<0.1%] 
in the romosozumab-to-alendronate group and 
4 [0.2%] in the alendronate-to-alendronate group) 
were positively adjudicated.
During the first 18 months of the trial, bind-
ing anti-romosozumab antibodies were observed 
in 310 of 2028 patients (15.3%) in the romoso-
zumab group; neutralizing antibodies were ob-
Figure 2. Incidence of New Vertebral, Clinical, and Nonvertebral Fracture.
The primary end points were the cumulative incidence of new vertebral fracture at 24 months (Panel A) and the cumulative incidence of 
clinical fracture at the time of the primary analysis (Panel B). For new vertebral fractures, the risk ratio was assessed among patients in 
the romosozumab group as compared with those in the alendronate group (at 12 months) and among patients in the romosozumab-to-
alendronate group as compared with those in the alendronate-to-alendronate group (at 24 months). Risks presented are based on a mul-
tiple-imputation method for patients with missing fracture status. For Kaplan–Meier curves of the first clinical fracture and the first 
nonvertebral fracture (Panel C) in the time-to-event analysis, data from patients who withdrew or reached the end of the reporting peri-
od without having a fracture were censored at the last observation time. P values for clinical and nonvertebral fractures were calculated 
with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model; P values for new vertebral fracture were calculated with the use of a logistic-regres-
sion model.

Discussion
In this phase 3 trial involving postmenopausal 
women with osteoporosis and a previous fracture, 
treatment with romosozumab for 12 months be-
fore alendronate was superior to alendronate 
alone with respect to the risks of a new verte-
bral, clinical, nonvertebral, and hip fracture. It is 
worth noting that romosozumab outperformed 
an effective drug; in large meta-analyses, alen-
dronate has been shown to consistently reduce 
vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures by up 
to 50%13,14 among patients with osteoporosis. In 
our trial, the effect of romosozumab on the risk 
of fracture was rapid: the risks of new vertebral 
fracture and clinical fracture were significantly 
lower with romosozumab than with alendronate 
at 12 months, findings that imply both a near-
term and persistent reduction in fracture risk 
with the initiation of romosozumab before anti-
Figure 3. Percentage Change from Baseline in Bone Mineral Density and Levels of Bone-Turnover Markers.
The least-squares mean percentage changes in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine (Panel A) and total hip (Panel B) are shown for 
patients who had a baseline measurement and at least one measurement obtained at a postbaseline visit at or before month 36. Be-
tween-group comparisons of the percentage change in bone mineral density were analyzed with the use of a repeated-measures model; 
P<0.001 for all comparisons. The median percentage change from baseline in the levels of serum procollagen type 1 N-terminal propep-
tide (P1NP) (Panel C) and β-isomer of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX) (Panel D) are shown for a subgroup of 266 pa-
tients who had serial assessments of bone-turnover markers as part of the biomarker substudy and had a baseline measurement and at 
least one measurement after the baseline visit. The substudy population was representative of the overall trial population. Between-
group comparisons of the percentage change from baseline in levels of P1NP and β-CTX were calculated with the use of the Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test; P<0.001 for the comparisons at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. I bars indicate pointwise 95% confidence intervals for the val-
ues of bone mineral density and interquartile ranges for the levels of P1NP and β-CTX.

resorptive therapy in patients at high risk for frac-
ture. Although the placebo-controlled Fracture 
Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporo-
sis (FRAME) showed that 12 months of romoso-
zumab had preventive effects with respect to verte-
bral and clinical but not nonvertebral fractures 
(potentially influenced by the lower baseline frac-
ture risk),5 the present trial assessed efficacy in a 
higher-risk population and showed broad bene-
ficial effects on fracture risk as compared with 
a commonly used active drug.
Romosozumab rapidly increased bone mineral 
density, a finding consistent with those of previ-
ous studies.5,15 We found significantly greater 
gains with romosozumab than with alendronate 
at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck 
by month 6. After the transition to alendronate, 
the significant difference between treatment 
groups was maintained. A plateau in bone mineral 
density was observed with ongoing alendronate 
therapy, a finding similar to results from other 
studies.10
Overall, adverse events and serious adverse 
events were balanced between the two groups. 
No cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical 
femoral fracture were identified during the pe-
riod of romosozumab-alone treatment. Events 
were observed in the alendronate open-label peri-
od, with four events of atypical femoral fracture in 
the alendronate-to-alendronate group and two in 
the romosozumab-to-alendronate group. Adjudi-
cated serious cardiovascular adverse events were 
more frequent in the romosozumab group than 
in the alendronate group during the double-blind 
period, with cardiac ischemic events and cerebro-
vascular events contributing to the imbalance.
There are theoretical considerations that scleros-
tin inhibition could be associated with cardio-
vascular risk. Sclerostin is constitutively expressed 
in the aorta16-18 and up-regulated in foci of vas-
cular and valvular calcification.19-22 The function 
of sclerostin in the vasculature is unknown. Al-
though sclerostin may function as a negative regu-
lator of vascular calcification and sclerostin inhibi-
tion could promote vascular calcification, studies 
have shown conflicting results.22,23 In long-term 
toxicology studies in rats17 and monkeys,17,24 there 
was no histologic or radiographic evidence of the 
development or exacerbation of vascular mineral-
ization. Vascular calcification, although not spe-
cifically examined, has not been reported in Sost 
knockout mice or patients with sclerosteosis or 
van Buchem’s disease.25-28
Further evaluation is needed to determine the 
cause of the observed imbalance in cardiovascular 
events. Such an imbalance was not seen in FRAME, 
a larger (7180 patients), placebo-controlled trial 
that enrolled a somewhat younger population 
with less advanced osteoporosis.5 Another impor-
tant contrast is the comparison drug. Alendronate 
has been associated with a reduction in the risk 
of cardiovascular disease in some studies29 but 
not in two meta-analyses,30,31 perhaps related to 
differences in the patient populations studied or 
the dosing of alendronate.32
Strengths of this trial include an active-com-
parator design involving patients with osteopo-
rosis and a high risk of fracture. Limitations 
include the facts that the trial was not designed 
as a cardiovascular-outcomes trial and that it did 
not include a placebo control. Investigation is on-
going, including evaluation of cardiovascular risk 
factors; however, the small number of events 
makes interpretation difficult.
In conclusion, rapid gains in bone mineral 
density from bone-forming therapy with romo-
sozumab were associated with a lower risk of 
fracture than with alendronate within 1 year and 
over the course of romosozumab followed by 
alendronate. Hip fractures were less frequent with 
romosozumab followed by alendronate than 
with alendronate alone, suggesting an important 
benefit and challenging the common treatment 
practice of first-line use of alendronate in wom-
en who have had a previous fracture. An imbalance 
in serious cardiovascular adverse events in com-
parison with alendronate was also found, which 
was not observed in a previous large, placebo-
controlled trial.
