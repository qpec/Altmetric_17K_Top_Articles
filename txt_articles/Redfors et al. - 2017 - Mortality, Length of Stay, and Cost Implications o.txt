IMPORTANCE Bleeding complications after percutaneous transcatheter interventions that
used large-bore catheters are frequent and associated with high mortality and morbidity.
OBJECTIVE To describe the incidence of bleeding complications among patients undergoing
contemporary endovascular interventions involving large-bore catheters and its association
with in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and health care cost.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study analyzed all 17 672
patients from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’
s National Inpatient Sample
database who were recorded as having undergone a transcatheter aortic valve replacement
(n = 3223), an endovascular aneurysm repair (n = 12 633), or a percutaneous left ventricular
assist device implant (n = 1816) between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013. Bleeding
complication was defined as any transfusion, any hemorrhage or hematoma, or the need for
percutaneous or surgical intervention to control the bleeding event. Health care costs were
determined by multiplying the total charge for each visit by the cost to charge ratios reported
for each hospital code in the database. Data were collected from the database on April 29,
2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Adjusted association between bleeding complications and
mortality was determined by multivariable logistic regression. Length of stay and total health
care costs were compared using multivariable linear regression between patients who did
and patients who did not have bleeding complications.
RESULTS Bleeding complications occurred in 3128 patients (17.7%) (1984 men and 1144
women, with a mean [SD] age of 75.6 [11.9] years). Bleeding was associated with higher
mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.27-3.22; P < .001) and longer hospital stay
(adjusted multiplicative difference, 2.14; 95% CI, 2.06-2.16; P < .001). Median (interquartile
range) total health care costs were $48 663 ($32 620-$71 547) for patients with bleeding
complications compared with $29 968 ($21 924-$43 287) for patients without a bleeding
complication (adjusted multiplicative difference, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.52-1.59; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Periprocedural bleeding was common among patients who
underwent transcatheter intervention using large-bore catheters and was associated with a
statistically significant increase in mortality, length of stay, and cost.

 S
everal endovascular techniques involving transcatheter
devices have emerged as treatment alternatives for pa-
tients with cardiovascular disease, including transcath-
eter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), endovascular aneurysm
repair (EVAR), and percutaneous ventricular assist device
(PVAD)implant.Theseproceduresrequiretheuseoflarge-bore
catheters, which are intrinsically associated with bleeding
complications.1,2Comprisingalargecohortofconsecutivereal-
world patients, this study describes the prevalence of bleeding
complications among patients who underwent contemporary
transcatheter therapies that used large-bore catheters and as-
sesses the effects of bleeding complications and transfusions
on in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and health care cost.
Methods
Study Cohort
We included all patients in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project’
s National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database who were
documented as having undergone TAVR, EVAR, or a PVAD im-
plant between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013. The NIS
is a sample of all discharges from hospitals participating in the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, which includes more
than7millioninpatientstaysperyearandhasasamplingframe
that covers more than 95% of the US population. No institu-
tional review board or patient informed consent approval was
requested,granted,orwaivedforthisstudybecausetheNISda-
tabasecontainednopatientidentifyinginformation.Datawere
collected from the database on April 29, 2016.
Definitions
Bleeding complication was defined as any transfusion (Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] proce-
durecodes99.00-99.09orICD-9diagnosiscodeV58.2,E873.0,
E934.7, or E876.0), any hemorrhage or hematoma (ICD-9 diag-
nosis code 998.11 or 998.12), or the need for percutaneous or
surgical intervention to control the bleeding event (ICD-9 pro-
cedurecode34.09,21.01-21.09,42.33,45.43,44.44,54.19,39.41,
60.94, 6.02, 34.03, 54.12, 49.95, or 57.93). For patients who re-
ceived multiple transfusions, transfusion event count was de-
termined by the total number of procedure codes entered for
blood product transfusions. Health care costs were derived by
multiplying the total charge for each visit by the cost to charge
ratios reported for each hospital code in the NIS database.
Objectives
We sought to (1) determine the incidence of bleeding complica-
tions among patients who underwent transcatheter interven-
tionsusinglarge-borecathetersand(2)studytheassociationof
bleeding complications (more precisely, transfusion) with in-
hospitalmortalityrisk,lengthofstay,andoverallhealthcarecost.
Statistical Analysis
We compared variables between patients with and patients
without bleeding complications using the χ2 test (categori-
cal) or unpaired, 2-tailed t test (continuous). A 2-sided P < .05
was considered statistically significant. Multivariable com-
parisons of patients with and patients without bleeding com-
plications as well as per number of documented transfusion
events were performed by logistic regression (mortality) and
linear regression (log-transformed total health care costs and
length of stay) and were adjusted for the covariates listed in
eTable 1 in the Supplement, with treating center as a random
effect. To determine whether bleeding complications af-
fected the outcomes differently depending on the procedure
(TAVR, EVAR, or PVAD), we included interaction terms in the
statistical models. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using
a propensity score derived from the variables in eTable 1 in the
Supplement.
Results
Study Cohort
Between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, there were
17 672 patients who underwent TAVR (n = 3223), EVAR
(n = 12 633), or PVAD implant (n = 1816). Bleeding complica-
tions occurred in 3128 patients (17.7%) (1984 men and 1144
women,withamean[SD]ageof75.6[11.9]years),2525(80.7%)
of whom required at least 1 transfusion (Figure). The inci-
denceofbleedingwas30.2%(972of3223)amongpatientswho
underwent TAVR, 13.4% (1687 of 12 633) among patients
who underwent EVAR, and 25.8% (469 of 1816) among pa-
tients who had a PVAD implant. Among patients who re-
ceived a transfusion, the proportion of patients who had more
than 1 transfusion event was 16.6% (130 of 782) among pa-
tients who underwent TAVR, 20.1% (288 of 1435) among
patients who underwent EVAR, and 27.6% (85 of 308)
among patients who had a PVAD implant.
In-Hospital Mortality, Length of Stay,
and Health Care Cost
Data on in-hospital mortality were available for 17 670 of 17 672
patients (99.9%) in the cohort. For the entire cohort, 993 of
17 670 patients (5.6%) died in the hospital (402 of 3128 pa-
tients [12.9%] with vs 591 of 14 542 patients [4.1%] without a
bleedingevent;P < .001);themedian(interquartilerange[IQR])
Key Points
Question What are the incidence of and association with
mortality, length of stay, and health care cost of bleeding
complications after percutaneous interventions using large-bore
catheters?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 17 672 consecutive
patients who underwent a transcatheter aortic valve replacement,
endovascular aneurysm repair, or percutaneous left ventricular
assist device implant, 18% experienced bleeding complications.
Patients with bleeding complications (compared with those
without) had increased in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and
health care cost.
Meaning Bleeding complications after percutaneous
interventions using large-bore catheters are common and
associated with poor prognosis and increased cost.

 lengthofstaywas7(3-12)daysforpatientswithableedingcom-
plication and 2 (1-5) days for patients without a bleeding com-
plication;P < .001;andthemedian(IQR)healthcarecostswere
$48 663 ($32 620-$71 547) for patients with a bleeding com-
plication and $29 968 ($21 924-$43 287) for patients without
a bleeding complication; P < .001. When stratified by proce-
dure type, unadjusted and adjusted in-hospital mortality,
length of stay, and health care costs were considerably greater
for patients with than for patients without a bleeding compli-
cation (Table 1; eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Impact of Transfusion
Receiving 1 or more transfusions was associated with in-
creased in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; 95%
CI, 1.63-2.21; P < .001), length of stay (adjusted multiplicative
difference, 2.10; 95% CI, 11.96-2.25; P < .001), and health care
cost (adjusted multiplicative difference, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.64-
1.81; P < .001), compared with receiving no transfusion. The
risk of dying (22.02% to 38.56% vs 8.21%), length of stay
(median [IQR], 8 [2-15] to 13 [7-15] days vs 6 [3-11] days), and
health care cost (median [IQR], $55 874 [$37 706-$83 460] to
$76 855 [$61 877-$138 596] vs $45 498 [$31 100-$64 387]) were
all higher for patients who had more than 1 transfusion event
than for patients who had only 1 documented transfusion
event (Table 2).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study represents the largest study of
the effect of bleeding complications after contemporary
transcatheter therapies that used large-bore catheters. The
principal findings were as follows: (1) Bleeding complica-
tions were common, occurring in almost 1 of 5 patients who
underwent transcatheter therapies; (2) bleeding complica-
tions were associated with a more than 2-fold higher
adjusted risk of dying, longer hospitalization, and higher
health care cost; and (3) the mortality risk, duration of hos-
pital stay, and costs increased as the number of transfusions
increased.
This study shows that almost 1 in 5 patients who had a
transcatheter intervention using a large-bore catheter had
a periprocedural bleeding complication, with approximately
1 in 7 patients requiring at least 1 transfusion, a finding
consistent with findings in previous (smaller) studies.4
One may argue that improvement in transcatheter tech-
nology over time would reduce the risk of bleeding.5,6
However, the widening adoption of percutaneous devices,
often being used by less experienced operators, is likely to
counterbalance the expected benefits of technological
improvements.4,7,8

reintervention was 2.8%, the incidence of blood transfusion was 11.4%, and
the incidence of reintervention was 0.6%. Among patients who underwent
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), the incidence rates were
9.1%, 24.3%, and 1.1%, respectively. The incidence rates for patients who had
percutaneous ventricular assist device (PVAD) implant were 10.1%, 17%, and
2.6%, respectively.

 The occurrence of bleeding complications was associ-
ated with an adjusted risk of in-hospital mortality that was
more than double compared with no bleeding complications,
which is consistent with previous reports.4,9 Patients who had
ableedingcomplicationwerehospitalizedmorethan3 times as
longaspatientswhodidnothaveableedingcomplication,with
healthcarecostsbeingalmosttwiceashigh.Furthermore,hav-
ing more than 1 transfusion considerably affected in-hospital
survival, length of stay, and cost, underscoring the detrimen-
tal effect of more severe bleeding that has been described in
several clinical settings, including the intensive care unit and
surgical theater.4,10-12
Ofnote,themortalityriskwasrelativelylowforpatientswho
underwent TAVR or EVAR and did not experience bleeding,
but the risk increased dramatically if a bleeding complication
occurred,particularlyforpatientswhounderwentEVAR.Better
preventive and bleeding avoidance strategies are needed if the
full benefits of these new techniques are to be achieved.5,13-15
Limitations
The NIS database does not contain detailed information on
the exact nature of the bleeding, such as its origin or the
magnitude of the reduction in plasma hemoglobin level, or
on the specific device type or profile used, which precludes
us from performing a more detailed analysis. In addition, a
single transfusion could require multiple units of bloods,
which may lead to an underestimation of the effect of blood
transfusions on the variables evaluated. Despite these limi-
tations, the present study consists of a large, consecutive,
and unselected population of all-comers patients, which
provides considerable statistical power to evaluate the
effect of bleeding events on hard end points, such as mortal-
ity, length of stay, and health care cost.
Conclusions
Procedural bleeding complications were common among pa-
tients who underwent transcatheter interventions that used
large-bore catheters and were associated with a significant
increase in mortality, length of stay, and health care cost. Given
the growing adoption of these procedures, bleeding avoid-
ance strategies are needed, including earlier detection and
better management of bleeding events.
