Isoxazolines are oral insecticidal drugs currently licensed for
ectoparasite control in companion animals. Here we propose their
use in humans for the reduction of vector-borne disease incidence.
Fluralaner and afoxolaner rapidly killed Anopheles, Aedes, and
Culex mosquitoes and Phlebotomus sand flies after feeding on a
drug-supplemented blood meal, with IC50 values ranging from
33 to 575 nM, and were fully active against strains with preexist-
ing resistance to common insecticides. Based on allometric scaling
of preclinical pharmacokinetics data, we predict that a single hu-
man median dose of 260 mg (IQR, 177–407 mg) for afoxolaner, or
410 mg (IQR, 278–648 mg) for fluralaner, could provide an insecti-
cidal effect lasting 50–90 days against mosquitoes and Phleboto-
mus sand flies. Computational modeling showed that seasonal
mass drug administration of such a single dose to a fraction of a
regional population would dramatically reduce clinical cases of
Zika and malaria in endemic settings. Isoxazolines therefore rep-
resent a promising new component of drug-based vector control.

ector-borne diseases, including malaria, Zika fever, and
leishmaniasis, remain major causes of mortality and mor-
bidity in (sub)tropical regions (1, 2). Temperate areas are also at
risk for such diseases, for instance, due to the reintroduction of
West Nile Virus in Europe (3). Elimination of these diseases will
require not only clinical development of new drugs and vaccines,
but also effective control of vector populations (4, 5). Drug-
based vector control is a new strategy that involves administra-
tion of an oral insecticidal drug to a human population at risk to
kill the insect vector on blood feeding, thereby reducing the
vector population and preventing disease transmission (6). This
approach has the advantage of being effective against mosquito
populations feeding outdoors, which are increasingly important
for malaria transmission (7) and escape the killing effects of
traditional vector control methods such as insecticide-treated
bed nets and indoor residual spraying. In contrast to approaches
targeting livestock, administering an insecticidal drug to a human
population would directly prevent onward transmission of hu-
man vector-borne pathogens and reduce the population size of
fully anthropophilic mosquitoes and sand flies, which play major
roles in the transmission of malaria in Africa and of visceral
leishmaniasis in India, respectively (8). An oral insecticidal drug
should preferentially have a long-lasting effect at a single dose to
minimize logistical challenges and cost of mass drug adminis-
tration (9), have a very broad safety window, and show activity
against a wide range of disease vector species.
Isoxazolines are a class of compounds recently licensed as
veterinary drugs for protection of companion animals against
fleas and ticks (10, 11), with very long in vivo half-lives that
provide weeks to months of protection after a single oral ad-
ministration (12, 13). Even though these compounds have neu-
ronal targets (Fig. 1A), they have been generally shown to be safe
in mammals, as they show limited brain penetration (14) and
significant selectivity for insect over mammalian receptors (12,
15). Herein we evaluate two representatives of this compound
class in multiple disease-carrying vector species and support the
case for their potential use as human oral vector-control drugs.
Results and Discussion
Insecticidal Activity of Fluralaner and Afoxolaner. The isoxazolines
afoxolaner and fluralaner (Fig. 1B) were tested on various strains
of Anopheles, Aedes aegypti, and Culex pipiens, which are im-
portant vectors for malaria, Zika/dengue, and West Nile virus,
respectively. Mosquitoes were fed on drug-supplemented human
blood by membrane feeding. At 24 h after the blood meal,
fluralaner showed IC50 values in the range of 33–92 nM against
all mosquito strains tested, whereas afoxolaner was slightly less
active, with IC50 values ranging from 90 to 177 nM (Fig. 1C and
Table 1). Isoxazolines occupy a binding site that is distinct from
the targets of known modulators of ionotropic GABA receptors
Significance
Reduction in clinical cases of vector-borne diseases is strongly
dependent on the ability to reduce the number of infectious
insect bites. Here we describe a treatment concept based on
single-dose administration of an insecticidal isoxazoline drug
to a human population, which leads to killing of blood-fed in-
sect vectors and a predicted sharp decline in disease trans-
mission. Based on the long half-life observed in preclinical
species, a single human dose of <500 mg is predicted to pro-
vide plasma exposure above the insecticidal threshold for
longer than 2 months. Importantly, we show that isoxazolines
are active against a range of vector species, which holds
promise for expanding the concept of drug-based vector con-
trol from malaria to leishmaniasis and arboviral diseases.

 (Fig. 1A) (16, 17). In line with this notion, fluralaner and afoxolaner
were fully active against the Anopheles gambiae Tiassalé 13 strain
that carries the resistance-to-dieldrin (rdl) mutation in the GABA
receptor (Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Table S1). In addition, they were
equipotent against pyrethroid- and carbamate-resistant strains car-
rying mutations in the kdr sodium channel and acetylcholine es-
terase (ace-1) genes (Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Table S1).
The compounds were further tested by membrane feeding of
sand flies, which are important vectors of Leishmania. Afox-
olaner and fluralaner showed IC50 values of 305 and 575 nM,
respectively, against Phlebotomus argentipes (Fig. 1C and Table
1), a vector of Leishmania donovani on the Indian subcontinent
(2). Both compounds were less active against the South Ameri-
can vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis, with IC50 values of 1–3 μM
(Fig. 1C and Table 1). The difference in isoxazoline activity seen
between sand flies and mosquitoes suggests that the targeted
pocket in the GABA receptor is not conserved among insects.
Human Dose Prediction. Neither fluralaner nor afoxolaner was
measurably metabolized when incubated with dog or human
hepatocytes, suggesting that the low in vivo intrinsic clearance
observed in dogs (12, 13) could be similar in humans (Table 2).
Both compounds were highly bound to plasma proteins (Table
2), which could further contribute to a long in vivo half-life.
Using published dog pharmacokinetic parameters (SI Appendix,
Table S2) (12, 18), we performed allometric scaling to predict
human plasma exposure following oral dosing. Obviously, plasma
concentrations after dosing of an eventual drug product will vary
among human subjects due to variations in absorption rates,
genotypes and expression of CYP450 drug metabolizing en-
zymes, etc. The exact distribution of human pharmacokinetic
parameters will not be known until human population pharma-
cokinetics data become available. However, to estimate vari-
ability, a stochastic simulation approach was adopted using a
fixed coefficient of variation (CV) of 20% with a log-normal
distribution for each parameter used in the single compart-
ment model, i.e., clearance (Cl), volume of distribution (V),
absorption rate (Ka) and bioavailability (F). This variation is in
line with data reported for the dog studies, where CV values
ranged from 14 to 24% (12, 18). Using this approach, we pre-
dicted the human dose resulting in circulating drug concentra-
tions above the mosquitocidal IC99 of Anopheles and Aedes for
90 d (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). The results indicate an estimated
single total human median dose level of 260 mg (IQR, 177–
407 mg) of afoxolaner or 410 mg (IQR, 278–648 mg) of flur-
alaner. For Culex, this dose would lead to circulating drug levels
above IC99 for 74 d. As sand flies appeared less sensitive to the
compounds (Table 1), a 410-mg dose of fluralaner would not

 yield sufficient plasma exposure for a sand fly killing effect,
whereas a 260-mg dose of afoxolaner would yield plasma con-
centrations above the Phlebotomus IC99 for 50 d.
Since the dose levels described above are reasonable amounts
to be formulated and delivered in a single-dose mass drug ad-
ministration, we used the associated 90-d period of efficacy in
Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes to model the potential effect on
two mosquito-borne diseases.
Modeled Impact on Zika Fever Incidence. Zika is an immunizing
infection, meaning that once an individual has been infected, he
or she is no longer susceptible to new infections. We modeled
the effect of an intervention in a population with historical ex-
posure to Zika at a moment in time when herd immunity had
declined to a degree that permits a new epidemic (19). Two
scenarios in which different proportions of the human pop-
ulation over age 5 years would be treated were explored. A 30%
coverage scenario assumes that women of childbearing potential
are excluded from treatment, because of the absence of human
teratogenicity data on initial entry of an isoxazoline drug on the
market. A second 80% coverage scenario implies that sufficient
data have been gathered to also treat women who are potentially
pregnant. The results show little difference between the two
scenarios and indicate that administration of an isoxazoline drug
once yearly is predicted to prevent >97% of all clinical cases
during the years of administration, even if only 30% of the
population is treated (Fig. 2A). As soon as the intervention
ceases, transmission restarts, then it peaks in the second year
after cessation of the intervention and wanes again thereafter.
The rebound in transmission may result in a higher cumulative
number of cases in the years postintervention compared with a
scenario without treatment. The data presented in Fig. 2A show
that in the absence of an intervention, 15% of the population
would be affected by the epidemic, whereas an epidemic delayed
by a 2-y isoxazoline intervention would affect 18% of the pop-
ulation. The overshoot in the number of cases after intervention
is explained by a reduction in herd immunity (due to deaths of
immune individuals) and an increase in the susceptible pop-
ulation (due to births) during the years of intervention.
The time scale and magnitude of the modeled epidemic are
consistent with past incidence data for Zika, most notably from
multiple Latin American countries in 2015–2017 (20, 21). Thus,
mass drug administration of a mosquitocidal drug is very efficient
in delaying Zika transmission in populations but needs to be
maintained to sustainably prevent outbreaks. This risk of disease
rebound is well known from mass drug administration programs
(22, 23), and the duration and coverage of any such campaigns
must be carefully chosen to optimize the risk-benefit ratio.
Modeled Impact on Malaria Incidence. Naturally acquired immunity
to malaria is mainly nonsterilizing but reduces the severity of in-
fections, and any infectious mosquito bite could potentially cause a
new infection. Therefore, a transient intervention, such as afox-
olaner/fluralaner administration, would result in a temporary re-
duction in malaria incidence and a large reduction in cumulative
incidence over a specified period. For example, in a transmission
setting with 17% malaria parasite prevalence by microscopy and a
short transmission season (approximately 5–6 mo), 80% coverage
of the population with the drug would result in a 75% reduction in
malaria cases in the intervention year (Fig. 2B). Under the same
conditions, 66% reduction in cases is achieved with a population
coverage of only 30% (Fig. 2B). Despite a slight rebound in
clinical incidence after cessation of treatment, the total relative
reduction in numbers of cases over a period of 4 y (with in-
tervention in the first 2 y) is 28% and 33% for scenarios with 30%
and 80% population coverage, respectively, compared with a
scenario with 0% coverage (no intervention). The potential impact
of an isooxazoline-based intervention seems much greater than
the predicted impact of mosquitocidal doses of ivermectin, which
is in line with the notion that the duration of the mosquitocidal
effect is one of the main drivers of clinical efficacy (24).
To further study the impact of prevalence and seasonality, we
estimated the reduction in clinical malaria cases for the malaria
endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa based on previously used
parameterization of malaria transmission heterogeneity (25) (SI
Appendix, Fig. S2). This model is based on data from 2015 and
does not take into account the results of continuing efforts in
malaria control and prevention that may have changed the
malaria landscape at the time when an isoxazoline drug will
reach the market (26). However, it is in line with current as-
sessments of mass “screening and treatment” and drug admin-
istration campaigns as provided by the Malaria Modeling
Consortium and does provide a comparison with the current
state of the art (27). Assuming a population coverage of 30%,
the modeling results show that the intervention has the greatest

 impact (>70% reduction in clinical cases) in areas with low and
very seasonal transmission, such as Senegal, Sudan, Madagascar,
Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe (Fig. 3). In these countries, a
large proportion of annual transmission occurs in a short period.
Therefore, administration of a single dose of an isoxazoline drug
at the beginning of this season would dramatically decrease the
number of cases over the full year. In the rest of the continent,
isoxazoline administration is predicted to have less impact but
still to result in a minimum 30% reduction in clinical cases. In
terms of absolute impact, a 30% reduction in cases in countries
like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the World
Health Organization estimated 16–26 million cases in 2015,
may be more significant than a 70% reduction in, for example,
Senegal, where the estimated number of cases was 1.1–2.8
million (28).
Because up-to-date information on population size at the
administrative unit scale is lacking (29), data on the absolute
reduction in cases cannot be provided here. Nevertheless, from

 this simplified but illustrative approach (see Materials and
Methods for limitations), the key message is that this intervention
is predicted to have a significant impact on malaria transmission,
with the greatest efficacy in areas with low transmission and a
short transmission season.
Preliminary Assessment of Human Safety. Nonclinical safety studies
of fluralaner (30, 31) and afoxolaner (32–34) have been con-
ducted for veterinary indications and can be leveraged to offer a
preliminary assessment of the human safety of a single dose of
these isoxazoline molecules. The reported oral toxicity profile of
afoxolaner consists of a diuretic effect (rats only), effects sec-
ondary to a reduction in food consumption (rats and rabbits
only), and occasional vomiting and/or diarrhea in dogs following
high oral doses. No treatment-related effects on vomiting or
diarrhea were noted in dogs following oral afoxolaner doses of
up to 31.5 mg/kg once monthly for 3 mo (33). Fluralaner showed
similar mild gastrointestinal events (diarrhea, vomiting, in-
appetence, and drooling) in dogs, no adverse events in a single-
dose toxicity study in rats, and some histopathological abnor-
malities in lung, thymus, and liver in a repeat dose study in rats in
the highest dose groups (400–600 mg/kg) with liver as the main
target, showing hepatocellular fatty changes (30). Importantly,
there was no significant neurotoxicity findings in rats or beagle
dogs. This is consistent with both in vitro and in vivo data
showing that these compounds have no significant interaction
with the mammalian GABA receptor (12, 15). Overall, isoxazo-
lines were well tolerated and showed mild and clinically moni-
torable adverse events. Moreover, both fluralaner and afoxolaner
were negative in mutagenicity/genotoxicity studies, and no effects
on embryo-fetal development in rats were observed below ma-
ternal toxic levels.
To assess a maximum human tolerated dose, we used the
guidelines provided by the US Food and Drug Administration to
translate the reported rat and dog no-adverse effect levels
(NOAELs) to cognate human dose levels. These allometry
guidelines are based on data showing that toxic endpoints scale
well between species when doses are normalized to body surface
area (35). The results show that anticipated median single doses
of fluralaner (410 mg) and afoxolaner (260 mg) in humans are
comparable to or lower than equivalent doses considered to be
NOAELs based on acute and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats
and dogs (SI Appendix, Table S3). Interestingly, veterinary for-
mulations of afoxolaner and fluralaner are based on racemic
mixtures, whereas the S-enantiomer has been reported to be the
active component against ectoparasites (15, 36). Thus, future
development of a human application of these molecules will
benefit from further characterization of the activity and toxi-
cology profile of the active enantiomer, which may lead to a 50%
reduction in the required dose. The veterinary application of the
racemic form of these drugs provides a first assessment of their
safety. Given the indirect clinical benefit of an isoxazoline-based
intervention, an extremely favorable human safety margin would
be essential, and detailed additional nonclinical studies (toxi-
cology, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism) will be required be-
fore a first-in-human isoxazoline drug application can be filed
with a regulatory authority. Alternatively, administration to
livestock could be considered as a means of controlling the

 vector population. This could be effective in areas where a large
proportion of blood meals is of livestock origin but would be less
effective in areas where insects are mainly anthropophilic (37).
Furthermore, the clinical impact would be significantly less
compared with a scenario of human administration, as the direct
effect on pathogen transmission would be lacking.
Conclusion
Drug-based vector control holds great promise for reducing
disease burden. Pioneering work with ivermectin, a broadly used
antihelminthic that shows adulticidal activity against Anopheles
mosquitoes, has delivered an important proof of concept by
demonstrating reduced survival of blood-fed mosquitoes and
likelihood of malaria transmission (38, 39). However, ivermec-
tin’s half-life (18 h in human) necessitates the use of multiple
doses, a limitation that poses challenges in terms of logistics and
drug compliance (6). Long-lasting formulations and higher doses
are being pursued to solve this issue (9, 38), but these will require
de novo safety studies, delaying entry into clinical studies and
ultimate market approval. Effectively, development times of
novel ivermectin formulations may be comparable to those of an
isoxazoline drug, although the latter cannot benefit from the vast
amount of pharmacovigilance data available for ivermectin. The
doses of ivermectin used today to impact anopheline mosquitoes
are insufficient for control of Aedes or Culex mosquitoes that
transmit arboviral diseases (40, 41). In contrast, our data show
potent effects of isoxazolines against a range of disease vectors.
The impact of mass isoxazoline drug administration may be
greatest in diseases where human is the single vertebrate host, as
opposed to diseases that cycle between a human and an animal
reservoir (e.g., West Nile Virus, leishmaniasis) (3, 42). As shown
in our modeling data, even a 30% population coverage could
lead to a substantial reduction in the clinical incidence of malaria
or Zika fever. In conclusion, repurposing of isoxazoline com-
pounds offers substantial promise for the development of a
single-dose vector-control drug based on a novel mode of action
compared with commonly used insecticides, with activity against
a broad range of relevant disease vectors.
Materials and Methods
Chemical
Extraction
and
Purification.
Fluralaner
and
afoxolaner
were
obtained by extraction and purification from Bravecto (Merck Animal Health)
and Nexgard (Merial) pills, respectively. The pills were smashed into fine
powder by mortar and pestle. A solvent of dichloromethane and methanol
(1:1) was then added to the powder. The mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 1 h and then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under a
rotary evaporator, and the product was purified by silica gel chromatogra-
phy. LCMS and NMR matched values reported in the literature (43, 44).
Mosquito Colonies. The colony of Anopheles stephensi (Sind-Kasur Nijmegen
strain) (45) was maintained at the Radboud University Medical Center at
30 °C and 70–80% humidity and on a 12/12-h day/night cycle. The A. gam-
biae strains Kisumu and Tiassalé 13 and the A. aegypti strains New Orleans
and Cayman were reared at the Liverpool Insect Testing Establishment.
Kisumu and New Orleans are insecticide-susceptible laboratory strains (46).
The New Orleans strain was originally colonized by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (47). The Tiassalé 13 strain was colonized from
southern Côte D’Ivoire, where resistance to all classes of insecticide is found
(46), and the Cayman strain was colonized from Grand Cayman, where A.
aegypti are highly resistant to DDT and pyrethroid insecticides (47). Both
resistant strains are routinely selected with insecticides to ensure the
maintenance of resistance (0.75% permethrin for Cayman and 0.05% del-
tamethrin for Tiassalé), and profiled for resistance to a range of insecticides,
including 4% dieldrin, to which Tiassalé is resistant but Cayman is susceptible
(SI Appendix, Table S1). The colony of C. pipiens biotype pipiens originated
from egg rafts collected from aboveground habitats in 2015 in Best, The
Netherlands, and was maintained at Wageningen University, The Nether-
lands, on a 16/8-h day/night cycle at 23 °C and 60% humidity (48).

50% human red blood cells and 50% human serum were supplemented with
different doses of either isoxazoline (3.16 μM, 1 μM, 316 nM, 100 nM,
31.6 nM, 10 nM, 3.16 nM, or 1 nM) diluted first in DMSO and then in serum
to reach a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%. A vehicle control (0.1% DMSO)
was included in all experiments. The supplemented blood meals were then
fed to 3-to 10-d old female mosquitoes in a membrane feeder system pre-
viously described for standard membrane feeding assays (49). At 24 h after
feeding, the numbers of dead and live mosquitoes among the fed pop-
ulation were recorded. Survival was calculated as the percentage of live
mosquitoes at 24 h postfeeding out of the total number of fed mosquitoes
per treatment.
Sand Fly Colonies and Feeding. P. argentipes (originating from India, 2008)
and L. longipalpis (originating from Brazil, 1991) have been reared at Lab-
oratory of Vector Biology, Charles University, Prague, for many generations.
Sand flies were maintained under standard conditions as described pre-
viously (50). For evaluation of insecticidal activity of isoxazolines on sand
flies, we tested different doses of fluralaner and afoxolaner (31.6 nM,
100 nM, 316 nM, 1 μM, 3.16 μM, and 10 μM) diluted in DMSO and mixed with
sterile defibrinated rabbit blood. One hundred females (3–5 d old) of both
species were fed through a chick-skin membrane on rabbit blood with dif-
ferent doses of insecticides. Fully blood fed females were separated, and
mortality was recorded at 24 h after a blood meal. The experiments with
both isoxazolines were done twice in P. argentipes and once in L. long-
ipalpis. A negative control (0.1% DMSO diluted in rabbit blood) was used in
all experiments. The displayed results are normalized to control mortality
(<3% in all experiments).
Data Analysis for Viability Assays. IC50 values were calculated by applying a
four-parameter logistic regression model using a least squares method to
find the best fit using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software package.
WHO Insecticide Susceptibility Test. The 2- to 5-d-old female mosquitoes were
routinely profiled for resistance to insecticides and colonies selected fol-
lowing the methodology recommended by the World Health Organization
(51) and using test kits and insecticide impregnated papers supplied by
Universiti Sains Malaysia.
Hepatocyte Metabolism Assays. Isoxazolines and control compounds (7-
ethoxycoumarin and 7-hydroxycoumarin; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in
DMSO at 10 and 30 mM, respectively, then diluted first 20-fold with 45%
methanol in water and another 10-fold in prewarmed Williams’ Medium E.
Cryopreserved human, dog, and rat hepatocytes (In Vitro Technologies) were
thawed, isolated by Percoll gradient, and suspended in Williams’ Medium E.
They were then dispensed into the wells of 96-well plates containing 10 μL of
diluted compounds, to reach a final concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/mL and
either 1 μM isoxazolines or 3 μM control. After an incubation at 37 °C of 0, 15,
30, 60 or 90 min, the reaction was stopped with acetonitrile. The samples were
then shaken for 10 min at 500 rpm and then centrifuged at 3,220 × g for 20 min.
Supernatants were transferred and stored at 4 °C until LC-MS-MS analysis.
Human Dose Prediction. Dog pharmacokinetic parameters reported previously
(12, 18) were used to estimate corresponding human parameters and derive
drug doses necessary to reach human plasma concentrations with insecticidal
activity. Details of the allometry methods are provided in SI Appendix.
Modeling of Mosquito-Borne Disease Incidence. The models of malaria and
Zika fever incidence were adapted from published transmission models (19,
24) to include yearly administration of an isoxazoline drug efficacious
against Anopheles and Aedes mosquitoes for 90 d. Details of the model
parameters are provided in SI Appendix.
Estimation of Human No Adverse Effect Levels. Mouse, rat, and dog NOAELs
obtained from publicly available safety studies on fluralaner (30, 31) and afoxolaner
(32–34) have been scaled to human values using allometry factors of 0.08, 0.16,
and 0.54 respectively, assuming a body weight of 60 kg for humans (35).
