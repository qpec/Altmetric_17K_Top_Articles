Objectives Our aim was to determine whether 
emergency physicians (EPs) felt their standard patient 
evaluation practice was modified by two non-private 
clinical encounters: hallway encounters and encounters 
during which a companion was present.
Methods We administered an iteratively developed 
cross-sectional survey at an annual national professional 
meeting. We used logistic regression to compare 
relationships among non-private clinical encounters and 
predictors of interest.
results 409 EPs completed the survey. EPs deviated 
from standard history-taking when practising in a 
hallway location (78%) and when patients had a 
companion (84%). EPs altered their standard physical 
exam when practising in a hallway location (90%) and 
when patients had a companion (77%). EPs with at 
least a decade of experience were less likely to alter 
history-taking in the hallway (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 
0.99). Clinicians who frequently evaluated patients in 
the hallway reported delays or diagnostic error-related 
to altered history-taking (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.11). 
The genitourinary system was the most common organ 
system linked to a delay or diagnostic error. Modifications 
in history-taking were linked to delays or failure to 
diagnose suicidal ideation or self-harm (25%), intimate 
partner violence (40%), child abuse (12%), human 
trafficking (8%), substance abuse (47%) and elder abuse 
(17%).
Conclusions Our study suggests that alterations in 
EP usual practice occurs when the doctor–patient dyad 
is disrupted by evaluation in a hallway or presence 
of a companion. Furthermore, these disruptions are 
associated with delays in care and failure to diagnosis 
medical, social and psychiatric conditions.
InTrOduCTIOn
Emergency physicians (EPs) often treat patients 
for whom privacy and confidentiality are of vital 
importance in settings where privacy and confiden-
tiality are difficult to protect.1 2 T
wo phenomena, 
the practice of evaluating patients in the hallway 
and the presence of a patient’s companion, change 
the environment for EPs as they perform their 
history and physical examination.
Evaluations that take place in the hallway may 
lead patients to be reluctant to divulge sensitive 
information and practitioners may omit parts of the 
physical exam that they would ordinarily perform. 
For example, in the evaluation of a patient with 
a fever, a single small skin lesion may be the key 
physical finding leading to the correct diagnosis. 
In this case, disrobing the patient is essential, and 
the hallway setting is a significant barrier. Balancing 
privacy and confidentiality with performing the 
indicated history and exam is often extremely diffi-
cult in the care of hallway patients and may ulti-
mately lead to adverse clinical outcomes.3 4
Furthermore, while one may intuitively under-
stand that the presence of an accompanying indi-
vidual would affect the dynamics of the EP–patient 
relationship and evaluation, the studies that have 
explored 
triadic 
(patient–companion–provider) 
encounters are concentrated in geriatric, oncolog-
ical, endocrine and primary care settings. There is 
no literature exploring the triadic clinical encounter 
in the emergency medicine department setting or 
patient outcomes related to triadic encounters 
beyond patient satisfaction.5–7
Little is known about how the hallway envi-
ronment or a companion’s presence impacts EP 
practice or patient outcomes. Our aim was to deter-
mine whether EPs perceived their standard patient 
Key messages
What is already known on this subject
 
► Previous studies that look at emergency 
medicine hallway care have not explored the 
effects of lack of privacy on the physician's 
physical exam and history-taking. Another 
potential mediator of physician behaviour is 
the triadic relationship  (patient-companion-
provider). This has been studied in geriatric, 
oncologic, endocrine, and primary care settings, 
but not in emergency medicine settings.
What this study adds
 
► In a survey of physicians attending a large 
emergency medicine conference, physicians 
reported alteration in practice occurs when the 
clinical encounter is in a hallway or because 
of the presence of a companion. Physicians 
perceived these alterations were associated 
with delays in care and failure to diagnosis 
medical, social, and psychiatric conditions. To 
maximize patient-centred, trauma-informed 
care for emergency department patients, the 
effects of non-private clinical encounters need 
further exploration.

evaluation practice was altered by two non-private clinical 
encounters: hallway encounters and encounters during which a 
companion was present. The aspects of the EP standard evalu-
ation we explored were history-taking and the physical exam.
MeThOds
study setting and population
Our study used a cross-sectional convenience sample survey 
of emergency medicine physicians. All study procedures were 
reviewed and approved by our IRB.
Survey respondents were recruited at the 2015 American 
College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Scientific Assembly 
conference in Boston, Massachusetts. We established a booth in 
the exhibit hall using funding from the department of emergency 
medicine at our hospital. Our inclusion criterion was that the 
respondent should be a practising EP
. Non-practising physicians 
and non-physicians were not eligible.
The booth remained open during exhibit hours (10:00 to 
15:00) for two consecutive days. Participants were entered into 
a daily raffle for a chance to win a $100 gift card to a local 
restaurant. A team consisting of three of the authors (JSB, 
ZM and AH) staffed the booth. Individuals were approached 
with scripted language and asked (A) if they were a practising 
emergency medicine physician and (B) if they were ‘willing to 
complete a short survey about their everyday practice’. The 
booth displayed posters with the study title (‘Dyad to Triad’) but 
no explanation of the content of the survey.
Methods of measurement
The study involved a 22-item survey instrument (online supple-
mentary data 1) to assess an emergency medicine practitioner’s 
modification of his or her standard patient interview or physical 
exam in relation to two types of non-private clinical encounters. 
These encounters included hallway encounters and ones where 
the patient was accompanied by another individual. Further-
more, the survey asked the respondents to report whether 
alterations in practice ever led to a delay or failure in diagnosis 
and, if so, the duration of the delay and the nature of the organ 
system, social issue or psychiatric condition involved. The survey 
was administered via laptop computers, using Qualtrics survey 
software.
The initial draft of the survey was developed in conjunction 
with the survey experts after a literature review. Pilot testing of 
the survey was conducted with 25 emergency medicine practi-
tioners across two academic institutions. First, a focus group of 
17 emergency medicine clinicians was convened, followed by 
qualitative analysis and revision, and then cognitive interviews 
were conducted with eight emergency medicine practitioners to 
hone language and wording precision.
Survey items were divided into three broad sections: demo-
graphics, history-taking practices and physical exam practices. 
The survey instrument used Likert scale (ie, never, rarely, some-
times, often and always) to allow EPs to report the likelihood of 
various behaviours.
Sample size calculations for the project were performed using 
the Stata V
.14 sampsi program. Briefly, based on the assumption 
that 50% of EPs who did not usually examine patients in the 
hallway would alter their physical exam in a non-private setting, 
a sample size of 400 would be necessary to detect an OR of 1.8 
at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. Further-
more, a sample size of 400 would have been necessary to detect 
an OR of 2.0 at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 
0.92.
Logistic regression was used to understand associations among 
respondent characteristics (years of practice, frequency of seeing 
patient in hallways and gender) and the effect of disruption of 
the dyadic (provider–patient) relationship on clinical practice.
resulTs
demographics and practice settings of study subjects
Four hundred and nine practising EPs were recruited to complete 
the survey. All clinicians who completed the consent statement 
completed the survey in its entirety with no missing questions. 
Of the 6140 physician attendees at the ACEP Scientific Assembly, 
568 eligible physicians were approached, 158 declined to partic-
ipate and 409 gave their consent and completed the survey, for a 
response rate of 72% (see figure 1).
Study respondents reported up to 40 years of clinical practice, 
with a mean of 11 years (table 1). Other characteristics of the

EP respondents, including gender and frequency of providing 
care in the hallway can be found in table 1. Ninety per cent of 
respondents reported that they altered history-taking and 56% 
of respondents altered physical exams based on the presence 
of other people (table 2). The 369 respondents who reported 
modifying their history-taking were further queried about the 
reasons for alteration. T
wo hundred and eighty-six individuals 
(77%) replied at least ‘sometimes’ to their alteration based 
on the patient’s location in the hallway, while 310 individuals 
(84%) identified the presence of a family member, friend or 
acquaintance led them to alter their clinical history-taking. The 
majority of respondents, 306 individuals (83%), responded that 
the patient’s gender played no role in the provider’s decision to 
alter the patient interview.
Self-report of alterations in physical exam mirrored those 
seen in history-taking. Of the 230 individuals who reported 
altering physical exam, a total of 206 respondents (90%) altered 
their exam at least ‘sometimes’ based on patients’ presence in 
the hallway, while 178 (77%) responded at least ‘sometimes’ 
to altering their physical exam due to the presence of someone 
known to the patient. A slightly smaller majority of providers, 
177 individuals (77%), reported that gender played no role in 
their decision to alter their physical exam.
delay and failures in diagnoses
Of the 369 respondents who reported alterations in their histo-
ry-taking and 230 individuals who reported alterations in their 
physical exams, 129 and 94 individuals (35% and 41%), respec-
tively, reported delays or failures in diagnoses related with these 
alterations. A similar proportion of delays (57% and 60%) in 
both categories were characterised as ‘by hours’ while only a 
very small percentage (2% and 2%) in both categories were 
delays on the order of ‘days’.
Of those who reported alteration in history-taking, 92 individ-
uals (71%) of the 129 respondents reported a delay or failure in 
diagnosis related to the genitourinary system. This finding corre-
sponds to those who reported alterations in the physical exam, 
with 68 individuals (72%) of the 94 respondents identifying a 
delay or failure in diagnosis related to the genitourinary system. 
A majority in both history-taking and physical exam modification 
groups, 82 and 67 individuals (64% and 71%) respectively, iden-
tified no relation or delay or failures in diagnoses of psychiatric 
illness. Yet, nearly a quarter (25%, n=32) of those who altered 
clinical histories based on the presence of third parties reported 
a delay or failure to diagnose suicidal ideation or self-harm. 
Moreover, alterations in the patient interview yielded delays or 
failure to diagnose intimate partner violence (40%, n=51), child 
abuse (12%, n=16), human trafficking (8%, n=10), substance 
abuse (47%, n=60) and elder abuse (17%, n=22).
Alterations in history-taking for patients seen in the hallway 
were significantly less common among EPs who had practised 
10 or more years (OR 0.55, 95% 
CI 0.31 to 0.99) but were not 
associated with frequency of evaluating patients in the hallway 
(OR 0.90, 95% 
CI 0.90 to 1.76) (table 3). Both clinicians who 
practised in the ED for 10 or more years and those who usually 
evaluated patients in the hallways were more likely to alter their 
physical exam in response to the presence of others (OR 1.49, 
95% 
CI 1.00 to 2.22 and OR 1.938, 95% 
CI 1.19 to 3.14, respec-
tively). Clinicians who usually evaluated patients in the hallway 
were more likely than those who did not to report delays in 
diagnosis due to alteration of history-taking (OR 2.34, 95% 
CI 
1.33 to 4.11). There was no association with alteration in patient 
interview due to a companion or due to provider gender.

Our study suggests that alterations in EP ‘usual’ practice 
commonly happens when the doctor–patient dyad is disrupted 
due to clinical care in the hallway or the presence of a companion. 
Furthermore, these disruptions lead to delays in care and failure 
to diagnosis medical, social and psychiatric conditions.
relation to other literature
Due to ED crowding, hallway patient care is becoming increas-
ingly commonplace. Care of the patient in the hallway caries 
logistical and ethical challenges, including affronts to human 
dignity, privacy and exacerbation of socioeconomic and race-re-
lated disparities.8 The results of this survey indicate a majority 
of EPs’ report altering their clinical history-taking (90%) during 
hallway care. These findings are similar to other studies exam-
ining communication between healthcare professionals and 
patients in non-private settings. A study by Chang9 demon-
strated patients experienced worse communication when they 
received care in the hallway.9 The literature on ED crowding has 
demonstrated poor clinical outcomes, but hallway patient care as 
a disaggregated phenomenon is minimally explored as of yet.10–12 
Our study adds to the hallway-specific literature on patient 
harms by showing that greater than one third of EP respondents 
reported delays or failures in diagnosis related to their deviations 
from their standard practice, and this delay was strongly associ-
ated with frequently seeing patients in the hallway. Notably, our 
finding of the predominance of delays and failure to diagnose 
conditions related to the genitourinary system is understandable 
as clinicians are forced to balance privacy considerations with 
quality care.
Non-ED literature on triadic clinical relationships demon-
strates that the presence of a companion adds complexity to the 
clinical encounter. Our findings of alterations in provider–patient 
communication based on triadic encounters is corroborated 
by geriatric studies. Barone and Greene found that the pres-
ence of caregivers can inhibit the candour of geriatric patients, 
preventing them from speaking openly about sensitive issues.13 
Furthermore, Ishikawa and colleagues14 found physicians and 
patients spoke significantly less when there was a companion 
present.14 In addition, literature on interpersonal violence finds 
that victims may be accompanied by a third party who may be an 
exploiter or abuser and underlines the importance of separation 
of the companion from the patient.15–17 Many questions remain 
about the best way to engage a companion, use the collateral 
history and support they provide and still maintain principles 
of patient-centred care, shared decision making and trauma-in-
formed care.18

meeting, walk through the exhibit hall and ultimately partici-
pate may differ significantly from other EPs in the USA. Despite 
this, our study’s gender composition is similar to national esti-
mates of EPs (males=62%, in our study 63%).19 Our sample 
captured a diversity of clinical experience, from 0 to 40 years 
of practice, with a mean of 11 years. Moreover, our response 
rate was 72%. As we did not collect data from non-responders, 
it is possible that there were significant differences between 
responders and non-responders. Interestingly, while we found 
that a general non-dyad clinical encounter affected the phys-
ical exam for those who usually see patients in the hallway, this 
relationship was not significant when examining the specific 
types of non-dyad encounters (ie hallway patient or accompa-
nied by someone). It is possible these results were null because 
of sample size. Furthermore, as with any survey study, social 
desirability bias may have caused respondents to under-report 
less socially desirable behaviours. We attempted to mitigate 
this effect by reinforcing the survey’s confidential nature in the 
consent process. Therefore, the fact that 93% of those surveyed 
noted that they changed their usual practice and more than a 
third of participants noted an adverse outcome (either an error 
in or a delay in diagnosis) may be under-reports. Furthermore, 
our ability to capture patient outcome through self-report relies 
on memory and knowledge of adverse outcomes. Due to the 
transient nature of EP–patient clinical encounters, and lack of 
longitudinal follow-up, our data likely underestimate the occur-
rence of such errors. In order to capture patient outcome data 
better, other methodologies such as retrospective chart reviews 
and prospective trials could be employed. Other mechanisms to 
measure alteration in usual behaviour include video or direct 
observation, which may suffer from the Hawthorne effect, and 
become complicated in terms of patient confidentiality especially 
with concern to hallway patients. By using a survey methodology 
at a national meeting, we were able to efficiently capture the 
perspective of hundreds of EPs from across the USA, which 
would not be feasible through a direct observation study.
Implications for practice
ED patients may disproportionately have past and active histories 
of trauma, including intimate partner violence and human traf-
ficking.20 Care in a hallway for patients who are victims of violence 
can be re-traumatising and may inhibit identification of and inter-
vention in their abuse. For example, ‘the exposure to others of 
intimate body parts and invasive treatments may evoke feelings 
of violation, acute embarrassment, shame, or resentment’.9 Trau-
ma-informed guidelines call for universal separation from accom-
panying individuals20 to allow for a private interview. This allows 
for the creation of a safe space for communication and examina-
tion. Our findings of delay or failure to diagnose intimate partner 
violence, child abuse, human trafficking, elder abuse, suicidal 
ideation and substance abuse reinforce the need for a universal 
trauma-informed approach, which allows for the occurrence of a 
one-on-one, dyadic patient provider discussion and exam.20–22
Moreover, our findings of delays and misdiagnosis have implica-
tions for exacerbating socioeconomic and racial disparities. Stiffler 
found, on average, patients who were treated in the hallway were 
more often black and had Medicaid or no health insurance.8
Hallway patient care is fundamentally driven by ED crowding, 
often secondary to the inability to transfer emergency patients to 
inpatient beds and resultant boarding of admitted patients in the 
ED.9 Further study of innovative approaches to control patient 
flow are necessary to mitigate the harms to hallway patients and 
increase the privacy of patient encounters.12 23 24
Our study suggests that alterations in EP usual practice occurs 
when the doctor–patient dyad relationship is disrupted by two 
phenomena: clinical evaluation in the hallway and the presence 
of a companion. Furthermore, these disruptions lead to delays in 
care and failure to diagnosis medical, social and psychiatric condi-
tions. Triadic clinical encounters, especially in the ED setting, are 
still poorly understood. To maximise patient-centred, trauma-in-
formed care for ED patients, the effects of non-private clinical 
encounters need further exploration.
