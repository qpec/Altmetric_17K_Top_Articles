Abstract
Influenza pandemics occur unpredictably when zoonotic influenza viruses with novel antigenicity 
acquire the ability to transmit amongst humans 1. Incompatibilities between avian virus 
components and the human host limit host range breaches. Barriers include receptor preference, 
virion stability and poor activity of the avian virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in human 
cells 2. Mutants of the heterotrimeric viral polymerase components, particularly PB2 protein, are 
selected during mammalian adaptation, but their mode of action is unknown 3–6. We show that a 
species-specific difference in host protein ANP32A accounts for the suboptimal function of avian 
virus polymerase in mammalian cells. Avian ANP32A possesses an additional 33 amino acids 
between the LRR and LCAR domains. In mammalian cells, avian ANP32A rescued the 
suboptimal function of avian virus polymerase to levels similar to mammalian adapted 
polymerase. Deletion of the avian-specific sequence from chicken ANP32A abrogated this activity 
whereas its insertion into human ANP32A, or closely related ANP32B, supported avian virus 
polymerase function. Substitutions, such as PB2 E627K, rapidly selected upon infection of 
humans with avian H5N1 or H7N9 influenza viruses, adapt the viral polymerase for the shorter

 mammalian ANP32A. Thus ANP32A represents an essential host partner co-opted to support 
influenza virus replication and is a candidate host target for novel antivirals.
The negative sense RNA genome of influenza virus is delivered into host cells associated 
with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a heterotrimeric complex of PB1, PB2 and 
PA proteins and the viral nucleoprotein NP. The viral ribonucleoprotein complex traffics to 
the cell nucleus where, in complex with various co-opted host factors, the viral polymerase 
directs transcription and replication of the genome 7. This intimate virus:host interaction is 
suboptimal for an avian influenza virus in mammalian cells, such that productive replication 
or onwards transmission do not occur until adaptive mutations are selected 3,4,8,9. The host 
range restriction of influenza A virus polymerase can be recapitulated in vitro, whereby 
functional viral polymerase, reconstituted by expression of PB1, PB2, PA and NP, directs 
amplification and expression of a model viral-like RNA 10. In mammalian cells, the low 
activity of reconstituted avian virus polymerase can be significantly increased by a single 
amino acid substitution (E627K) in PB2 11,12. In contrast, in avian cells, polymerases 
bearing either E or K at PB2 627 are active 11,16. Influenza A viruses that circulate in 
humans either have lysine at PB2 627 or, as in 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, substitutions at 
residues 271, 590 and 591 13,14 that map close to 627 on the polymerase structure 15, 
suggesting a common mechanism of host adaptation.
We previously showed that heterokaryons formed by fusing human and avian cells supported 
avian virus polymerase activity suggesting that host range restriction was explained by a 
species-specific difference in a positive avian host factor that was either lacking or different 
in mammals 10. To identify this factor, we took advantage of a chicken genome radiation 
hybrid (RH) panel based on the Wg3H hamster cell line and harbouring different fragments 
of chicken chromosomes 17. Each RH clone was screened for the ability to support activity 
of a H5N1 avian influenza virus polymerase (A/turkey/England/50-92/91 virus (50-92)) 
compared with its human-adapted isoform bearing PB2 E627K. Four of 53 clones supported 
activity of the avian virus polymerase (Figure 1a). Due to instability of the chicken 
chromosome content, one positive clone lost this phenotype by passage 12. To identify 
chicken genes expressed in the positive RH clones but not in negatives, total RNA was 
analysed using an Affymetrix™ chicken gene array. The four early passage positive clones 
had 35 chicken genes in common (Figure 1b). After P12, the remaining positive hybrids 
shared only 12 genes in common, all present on a region of chicken chromosome 10 (Figure 
1c and Extended Data Table 1). Genetic instability of the clones is revealed by PCA 
mapping analysis, as is variation between negative clones (Extended Data Fig 1).
We targeted candidate genes within this region and co-expressed each individually in human 
293T cells with reconstituted H5N1 50-92 influenza virus polymerase. Expression of a 
single chicken gene, chANP32A (chicken Acidic (Leucine-rich) Nuclear Phosphoprotein 32 
Family, Member A), rescued avian virus polymerase activity to levels similar to human-
adapted PB2 627K viral polymerase (Figure 1d). All positive hybrid clones expressed 
chANP32A (Extended Data Fig. 2). Knockdown of chANP32A abrogated the ability of 
positive RH clone 476 to support avian virus polymerase, suggesting this single chicken 
gene was responsible for the phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 3). Chicken homologues of

 DDX17 and members of the importin alpha family previously implicated in host range 
restriction of influenza virus polymerase did not rescue avian virus polymerase activity in 
human cells (Figure 1d) 18,19.
ANP32A is a member of a family of nuclear proteins implicated in multiple cellular 
pathways; including transcriptional regulation by chromatin remodelling, mRNA export and 
cell death 20. ANP32 proteins share conserved N terminal domains, comprised of leucine 
rich repeats (LRR) and C-terminal low complexity acidic regions (LCAR) comprised of 
60-75% glutamic or aspartic acid (Figure 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8). We expressed 
cloned human homologue (huANP32A) as well as human and chicken genes for the related 
family member ANP32B. Expression of chANP32A, but not huANP32A, in human cells 
rescued activity of several different avian influenza polymerases including those from low 
(H1N1 A/duck/Bavaria/79 (Bav), H9N2 A/UDL/2008 (UDL)), and high (H5N1 (A/turkey/
Turkey/05/2005 (Ty05) and A/turkey/England/50-92/91 (50-92)) pathogenicity avian 
viruses, and a human H3N2 virus (A/Victoria/3/75 (Vic)) when PB2 bore 627E (Extended 
Data Fig. 4). Expression of chANP32A but not huANP32A, chANP32B or huANP32B, 
increased levels of all three species of minigenome RNA produced by reconstituted avian 
viral polymerase in human cells (Figure 2a-c). Increase in levels of viral genomic RNA 
(vRNA) and complementary antigenomic RNA (cRNA) in the polymerase assay indicates 
that RNA replication, and not only mRNA transcription or stability, was enhanced by the 
expression of the chicken host factor in mammalian cells. Expression of chANP32A in 
human cells did not affect levels or nuclear accumulation of PB2, suggesting that its ability 
to support polymerase activity in the cell nucleus is not mediated by enhanced nuclear 
trafficking (Extended Data Fig. 5).
Additionally, expression of chANP32A enhanced avian virus replication in human cells. 
Levels of all three influenza RNA species derived from avian virus segment 1 were 
increased by expressed chANP32A but not huANP32A (Figure 2d-f). Moreover, the yield of 
infectious avian-like influenza virus was enhanced whether chANP32A was expressed in 
human cells at 33°C (Figure 2 g) or 37°C (Extended Data Fig. 4c). In contrast, chANP32A 
did not enhance yields of an isogenic PB2 627K recombinant virus, and over-expression of 
huANP32A reduced its titre (Figure 2g and Extended Data Fig. 4c).
We confirmed a role for ANP32A in supporting virus replication in avian cells. In chicken 
cells (DF-1, immortalized chicken fibroblasts), shRNA (Figure 3 a and Extended Data Fig. 
6) and siRNA (Figure 3b ) targeting chANP32A decreased activity of avian virus 
polymerase (PB2 627E). Knockdown of ANP32A in DF-1 cells also decreased the yield of 
infectious avian-like influenza virus (Figure 3c).
We next investigated whether the human homologues of ANP32A or B support activity of 
influenza polymerase in human cells. Human ANP32A and B were previously listed in the 
human influenza A virus interactome 21, and depletion of huANP32A and/or huANP32B 
from human cells decreased polymerase activity and replication of human influenza 
virus 22,23. We used sh or siRNA to target huANP32A and B in human cells. Human-
adapted viral polymerase (50-92 PB2 627K) activity was reduced when levels of either 
ANP32A or B were decreased, and further reduced in cells from which both proteins were

 depleted, suggesting a dependence on both family members (Figure 3d and Extended Data 
Fig.7). Yields of influenza virus A/England/691/2010, a seasonal H3N2 human virus, were 
decreased in cells depleted of ANP32A and/or ANP32B (Figure 3e). We note with interest 
that both depletion and overexpression of human ANP32A or B were deleterious for 
polymerase activity and virus yields in human cells (Figure 2) which suggests that influenza 
virus relies on balanced expression of ANP32 proteins.
Sequence alignment of avian and mammalian ANP32A revealed that avian (except ratite) 
ANP32A harbours an additional 33 amino acids (176-208), derived partly by a repeat of 
amino acids 149-175, expressed from an additional exon absent from mammals and ostrich 
(Extended Data Fig. 8). Avian ANP32B does not contain the additional sequence (Extended 
Data Fig. 8). We cloned and FLAG-tagged ANP32A cDNA from chicken, turkey, duck, and 
zebrafinch, all of which encode homologues with the additional sequence, and also from 
ostrich, human, mouse, and pig, all of which were mammalian-like in length (Figure 4a, b 
and d). The four longer avian proteins increased avian, but not human-adapted, influenza 
virus polymerase activity in human cells (Figure 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9). In contrast, 
the ostrich protein, or any of the mammalian homologues, did not rescue avian virus 
polymerase activity. Interestingly, replication of avian influenza viruses in ostrich and other 
ratites selects for mammalian-adapted PB2 mutants 24.
Deletion of amino acids 176-208 from chANP32A abrogated its ability to support avian 
virus polymerase. Conversely, insertion of the additional avian-specific 33 amino acids 
bestowed upon either huANP32A or huANP32B the ability to support avian virus 
polymerase (Figure 4c and d).
In summary, we conducted a novel screen of chicken genome RH cells and identified a 
single chicken gene, ANP32A, which supports avian influenza virus polymerase activity in 
human cells. We suggest that avian influenza virus has co-evolved with its natural hosts, 
wild birds, to co-opt avian ANP32A as a host factor that supports its polymerase activity in 
the nucleus. The avian influenza polymerase cannot efficiently utilize shorter ANP32 
proteins, such as ANP32B or mammalian ANP32A homologues, for this activity. 
Acquisition of host-adapting mutations, such as PB2 E627K, enables polymerase activity to 
be supported by the shorter ANP32 proteins typical of mammalian hosts. The underlying 
mechanism of avian influenza polymerase restriction in human cells has evaded researchers 
for decades. Others have previously demonstrated a role for PB2 residue 627 in its 
interaction with NP 12,25, and viral RNA promoter sequences 26,27 that may influence 
recognition of incoming vRNPS by RIG-I 28. The nature of residue 627 has also been linked 
with a PB2 dependency on specific importin family members 19,29. How these observations 
are linked with the species difference in host factor ANP32A we describe here remains to be 
elucidated.
Substitutions in PB2 are rapidly selected after avian influenza viruses enter mammalian 
hosts and PB2 adaptation is essential to support the pandemic potential of emerging avian 
influenza viruses. This stringent requirement for the virus to optimize replication efficiency 
in the human host suggests that disrupting the virus’ interaction with ANP32A may be a 
novel means for virus control.

 Methods
Cells and cell culture
Chinese Hamster cell line (Wg3h), chicken genome RH clones (Laboratoire de génétique 
cellulaire, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Castanet-Tolosan, France) 17, 
human embryonic kidney (293T) (ATCC), human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells 
(A549) (ATCC) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC) were maintained in 
cell culture media (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) 
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Biosera) and with 1% penicillin-
streptomycin (Invitrogen)). Chicken fibroblast (DF-1) (ATCC) cells were maintained in 
DF-1 cell culture media (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 5% tryptose phosphate broth 
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% Penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen)). Cell lines were maintained 
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell lines were authenticated by RT-PCR and verified 
negative for mycoplasma.
Microarray analysis
Total RNA was extracted from 1×106 cells that were of the same passage as those tested for 
polymerase, using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. On-
column DNA digestion was performed using RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) to remove 
contaminating genomic DNA. RNA samples were quantified using a Nanodrop 
Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and checked for quality using a 2100 Bioanalyzer 
(Agilent Technologies). All RNA samples had an RNA integrity number (RIN) ≥ 9.8. Array 
hybridisation was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix). 
Labelled samples were hybridized to the Affymetrix Chicken Gene 1.0 ST Arrays in a 
GeneChip Hybridization Oven for 16 h at 45°C and 60 rpm in an Affymetrix Hybridization 
Oven 645. After washing and staining, the arrays were scanned with the Affymetrix 
GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Gene-level expression signal estimates were derived from CEL 
files generated from raw data using the multi-array analysis (RMA) algorithm implemented 
from the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console Software Version 3.0.1. Data Pre-
Processing and filtering was done using Partek Software Version 6.6 and included: RMA 
background correction, quantile normalization across all chips in the experiment, log2 
transformation and median polish summarization. Statistically significant genes were 
discovered by comparisons between the positive RH clones, parent cells and negative RH 
clones by two-way ANOVA (variables: clone and passage number) adjusted with the 
Benjamini–Hochberg multiple-testing correction (false discovery rate (FDR) of P<0.05). 
Statistically significant genes were identified and those with fold-change values <|±1.5| were 
removed.
Cloning of candidate cDNAs
Sequence specific primers were used to amplify targeted cellular transcripts of chicken 
genes from chromosome 10, including: ANP32A, RAB11A (Ras-related protein Rab-11A), 
TIPIN (TIMELESS Interacting Protein), RPL4 (Ribosomal Protein L4), PIAS1 (Protein 
Inhibitor Of Activated STAT, 1), TLE3 (Transducin-Like Enhancer Of Split 3), EIF3J 
(Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3, Subunit J) and CTDSPL2 (CTD (Carboxy-
Terminal Domain, RNA Polymerase II, Polypeptide A) Small Phosphatase Like 2) from

 total RNA extracted from RH clone 476, using SuperScript® III One-Step RT-PCR System 
(Invitrogen). Chicken ANP32B, DDX17 (DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) Box Helicase 17), 
IMPα1, 3 and 7 (Importin α-1,3 and 7) cDNAs were amplified from RNA extracted from 
DF-1 cells. PCR products were cloned into the pCAGGS expression vector. cDNAs of full 
length ANP32A isoforms of several species were generated by gene synthesis (GeneArt® 
Strings™ DNA Fragments) and inserted into the pCAGGS expression vector, based on the 
following sequences: Chicken ANP32A (chANP32A) (Gallus gallus, XP_413932.3), 
Human ANP32A (huANP32A) (Homo sapiens, NP_006296.1), Zebra finch ANP32A 
(zfANP32A) (Taeniopygia guttata, XP_012424064.1), Duck ANP32A (dkANP32A) (Anas 
platyrhynchos, XP_005023024.1), Turkey ANP32A (tyANP32A) (Meleagris gallopavo, 
XP_010715918.1), Ostrich ANP32A (osANP32A) (Struthio camelus australis, 
XP_009665579.1), Pig ANP32A (pgANP32A) (Sus scrofa, XP_003121807.3), Mouse 
ANP32A (muANP32A) (Mus musculus, NP_033802.2), Chicken ANP32B (chANP32B) 
(Gallus gallus, NP_001026105.1) and Human ANP32B (huANP32B) (Homo sapiens, 
NP_006392.1). The sequence of dkANP32A was amended to contain the sequence encoding 
the intact N-terminus by comparison with duck RNA-seq data (from ENA_ERP005909) that 
had been de novo assembled (using CLC Genomic Workbench 7.5.1), where the appropriate 
contig was identified by BLASTX against the chicken ANP32A protein sequence. 
Furthermore, the duck sequence was confirmed by reverse-transcription of ANP32A mRNA 
derived from duck embryonic fibroblast cells and DNA sequencing. Mutants of these 
sequences were also generated by gene synthesis, as above, and included: chANP32AΔ33 
(chANP32A with the ‘avian insertion’ deleted (aa176-208)), huANP32A+33 and 
huANP32B+33 (huANP32A and B with the avian sequence – 
VLSLVKDRDDKEAPDSDAEGYVEGLDDEEEDED– inserted after aa175 (huANP32A) 
and aa173 (huANP32B)). All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Primers 
and sequence information are available upon request.
Generation of recombinant and clinical Influenza A virus
Reverse genetics systems for the following virus strains were used in this study: PR8 (H1N1 
A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) 30, UDL (H9N2 A/chicken/UDL-01/08) 31 (developed in 
collaboration with M. Iqbal, Pirbright Institute, UK) and Ty05 (H5N1 A/Turkey/Turkey/
5/2005) (a kind gift from R. Fouchier, Erasmus University, Netherlands). The PB2 E627K 
substitution was made to 50-92, Ty05 (K627E) by overlapping PCR of the PB2 plasmid as 
previously described 11. Ty05:PR8 6:2 recombinant virus was generated with the HA and 
NA derived from PR8 and the internal genes of Ty05; virus rescue was performed by co-
transfection of the 12-plasmid system: 8 polI plasmids as described above and 4 helper 
expression plasmids encoding A/Victoria/3/75 (VIC) polymerase components and NP 
expressed by the pCAGGS vector, as previously described 32,33. UDL virus rescue was 
performed by co-transfection of a 9 plasmid system including: 7 bidirectional pHW2000 
plasmids 34 encoding PB2, PA, HA, NA, NP, NS and M genes, together with a polI plasmid 
encoding PB1 and a pCAGGS expression plasmid of the UDL-PB1 gene. Ty05 virus stocks 
were propagated in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs incubated at 37°C. UDL virus 
stocks were generated in MDCK cells with infection media (serum free DMEM 
supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 1μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin (Lorne 
Labs)) and incubated at 37°C. Clinical isolate A/England/691/2010 (H3N2) (Public Health

 England) was propagated in MDCK cells with infection media. Aliquots of infectious virus 
were stored at −80°C. Infectious titres were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells.
Influenza A virus infection
293T cells were transfected with ANP32A (500ng, 24-well) using Lipofectamine 3000 
(Invitrogen) and after 20hrs infected with virus diluted in serum free DMEM for 1hr at 33 or 
37°C (MOI as indicated in the relevant figure legends) and replaced with cell culture 
medium (for qRT-PCR analysis) or DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FCS and 1μg/ml TPCK 
trypsin (Worthington-Biochemical) (for infectious virus titres). shRNA A549 cells were 
infected with virus as for 293T cells, except infection media lacked FCS. Infected cell 
lysates and cell supernatants were harvested at 12 and/or 24hrs post-infection. Infectious 
titres were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells.
Safety/biosecurity
All work with infectious agents was conducted in biosafety level 2 facilities, approved by the 
Health and Safety Executive of the UK and in accordance with local rules, at Imperial 
College London, UK.
Polymerase assay
Influenza polymerase activity was measured by use of a minigenome reporter which 
contains the firefly luciferase gene flanked by the non-coding regions of the influenza NS 
gene segment, transcribed from a species-specific polI plasmid with a mouse terminator 
sequence 35. The human and chicken polI minigenomes (pHOM1-Firefly and pCOM1-
Firefly) are described previously 36 ; pMouse-PolI-Firefly was generated by substituting in 
the mouse polI promoter sequence 37. pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding each 
polymerase component and NP for 50-92 (H5N1 A/Turkey/England/50-92/91), Ty05, VIC 
and BAV (A/Duck/Bavaria/1/77) are described previously11,36,38. UDL PB1, PB2, PA and 
NP genes were sub-cloned into the pCAGGS plasmid. Mutagenesis of PB2 genes to encode 
PB2 627K or 627E was performed by overlapping PCR as described previously 11,36. All 
plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Primers and sequence information are 
available upon request. To measure influenza polymerase activity, 293T cells were 
transfected in 48-well plates with pCAGGS plasmids encoding the PB1 (20ng), PB2 (20ng), 
PA (10ng) and NP (40ng) proteins, together with 20ng species-specific minigenome reporter 
and 10ng Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (pCAGGS-Renilla)39 as an internal control, 
using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers’ 
instructions. Wg3h, RH clones and DF-1 cells were transfected as 293T cells but with twice 
the concentration of DNA and using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated 
at 37°C. 20hrs after transfection, cells were lysed with 50 μl of passive lysis buffer 
(Promega), and firefly and Renilla luciferase bioluminescence was measured using a Dual-
luciferase® system (Promega) with a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). The 
effect of cellular factors on influenza polymerase was examined by polymerase assay after 
expression of constructs (250ng) for 24hrs.

 shRNA mediated silencing
Silencing was achieved by lentivirus delivery of shRNA encoding transgenes. Lentiviral 
vectors were generated using the TRC1.5-pLKO.1-puro plasmid (MISSION® Sigma-
Aldrich) containing the shRNA sequence and puromycin selection gene. shRNA sequences 
for target genes were as follows: huANP32A (TRCN0000006905, 5’-

TT-3’ (target sequence, 5’-CCTGAAGATGAGGGAGAAGAT-3’)), huANP32B

T-3’ (target sequence, 5’-CCTATTGTGATTTGACTGTTT-3’)) and Negative (SHC002, 
Non-Mammalian shRNA Control) (MISSION® Sigma-Aldrich). Lentiviruses were 
generated by co-transfection in 293T cells with pCMV-delta8.2 40, pCAGG-VSV G 41 and 
TRC1.5-pLKO.1-puro at a ratio of 1:0.25:1 using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen), cell 
culture media was replaced after 16hrs at a reduced volume and supernatant harvested at 
36hrs post-transfection before being filtered (0.45μm) and aliquots frozen at −80°C. 293T, 
A549 or DF-1 cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors for 16hrs before media was 
replaced. After 72hrs incubation, cells were split and cell culture media was replaced 
containing 0.5μg/ml puromycin (Invivogen). Cells were incubated a further 72hrs after 
selection before analysis.
siRNA mediated silencing
DF-1, 293T or RH clone 476 cells were transfected with 100nM of siRNA using HiPerFect 
transfection reagent in 48-well plates, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). 
48hrs later cells were transfected with polymerase and minigenome constructs and harvested 
after a further 20hrs, for luciferase quantification and knockdown analysis. Total RNA was 
extracted as described previously but with 100μl of cell lysate added to AVL buffer before 
continuing with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). siRNAs for target genes were as follows:, 
AllStars Negative Control, huANP32A (SI02655212 FlexiTube), huANP32B (SI02655380 
FlexiTube) (Qiagen), 50-92 NP (5’-AAGGAUCUUAUUUCUUCGGAG-3’), chANP32A 
(5’-GAGCTGGAATTCTTGAGTACA-3’) (custom RNA oligos, Sigma-Aldrich).
Quantification of chANP32A and B mRNA levels
Total RNA from RH clones and DF-1 cells were extracted using an RNeasy mini kit 
(Qiagen), following manufacturer’s instructions. During extraction of RNA, RNeasy 
columns were treated with RNase-Free DNase (Qiagen). RNA samples were quantified 
using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Equal concentrations of RNA

 GTTTGCAACTGAGGCTAAGC-3’) and chANP32B (5’-
ATGAGCATCGTCACCTCGC-3’). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed 
(Applied Biosystems ® ViiA™ 7 Real-Time PCR System) and absolute copy numbers of 
either chANP32A or B calculated using a standard curve of known concentrations of the 
corresponding cDNA expression plasmid. Primers were designed to be specific to their 
target transcripts by using BLASTX against both the hamster and chicken genomes.
Quantification of RNA generated by influenza polymerase
Purified total RNA (1000ng) was subject to first-strand cDNA synthesis with gene specific 
primers, oligo(dT)20 or random hexamers (to amplify mRNA) using SuperScript® III 
(Invitrogen) followed by RNaseH treatment (Invitrogen). Primer design was based on 
Obayashi et al. (2008) 42 for quantification of RNA species of the luciferase minigenome 
driven by reconstituted polymerase, and UDL PB2 RNA species were quantified using a 
tagged-primer system adapted from Kawakami et al. (2011) 43. First strand primers 
included: luciferase vRNA (5’- TATGAACATTTCGCAGCCTACCGTAGTGTT-3’), 
luciferase cRNA (5’-AGTAGAAACAAGGGTG-3’), luciferase mRNA (Oligo(dT)20), UDL 
PB2 vRNA (5’-GGCCGTCATGGTGGCGAAT(tag)GATGCGTGATGTATTGGGAAC-3’), 
UDL PB2 cRNA (5’-GCTAGCTTCAGCTAGGCATC(tag)AGTAGAAACAAGGTCGTT-3’), 
UDL PB2 mRNA (Oligo(dT)20) and 18S ribosomal RNA (Random Hexamers (Invitrogen)). 
After first strand synthesis, 1ul of cDNA was subject to real-time quantitative PCR analysis 
with a gene specific primer pair using SYBR green PCR mix (Applied Biosystems) and 
analysed on the Applied Biosystems ® ViiA™ 7 Real-Time PCR System. Gene specific 
primer pairs were as follows: Luciferase gene (5’-CCGGAATGATTTGATTGCCA-3’ and 
5’-TATGAACATTTCGCAGCCTACCGTAGTGTT-3’), UDL PB2 vRNA (5’-
GGCCGTCATGGTGGCGAAT(tag)-3’ and 5’-CCTCTCAACACTGCAGATTCC-3’), UDL 
PB2 cRNA (5’-GCTAGCTTCAGCTAGGCATC(tag)-3’ and 5’-
GGAATCTGCAGTGTTGAGAGG-3’), UDL PB2 mRNA (5’-
GATGCGTGATGTATTGGGAAC-3’ and 5’- CCTCTCAACACTGCAGATTCC-3’) and 
18S ribosomal RNA (5’-GCAAATTACCCACTCCCG-3’ and 5’-
CTGCAGCAACTTTAATATACGC-3’). Fold change RNA to PB2 627E with Empty vector 
was calculated by ΔΔCT including normalisation to ct values of 18S ribosomal RNA.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed in Passive Lysis buffer (Promega) or NP40 lysis buffer (for cellular 
fractionation) and prepared in Laemmli 2xbuffer (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell proteins were 
resolved by SDS-PAGE using Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Gels (Bio-Rad). 
Immunoblotting was carried out using the following primary antibodies: α-chANP32A 
rabbit polyclonal (LS-B10851, LifeSpan BioSciences, Inc.), α-huANP32A rabbit polyclonal 
(AB51013, Abcam), α-huANP32B rabbit monoclonal (AB184565, Abcam), α-vinculin

 Figure 1. Identification of a positive avian cellular factor that permits avian influenza virus 
polymerase activity in mammalian cells by screening radiation hybrid clones
a, RH clones transfected with mouse-polI-firefly minigenome reporter, avian influenza virus 
H5N1 50-92 polymerase (either PB2 627E or PB2 627K) and Renilla expression control. 
Passage 1 clones black bars, Passage 12 clones grey bars. (Data as a ratio of PB2 627E/K 
polymerase activity (firefly normalised to Renilla); n=3 biological replicates; one-way 
ANOVA, comparisons to Wg3h, ****p<0.0001; error as SEM of the ratio). b, VENN 
diagram of microarray data analysis of P1 positive hybrid clones vs Parent Wg3h cells. c, 
VENN diagram of P12 positive hybrid clones vs parent and 365P1 (positive RH clone) vs 
365P12 (reverted RH clone) (total gene numbers in brackets); Two-way ANOVA (variables: 
clone and passage number) adjusted by Benjamini–Hochberg multiple-testing correction 
(false discovery rate (FDR) of P<0.05). Statistically significant genes identified and those 
with fold-change values <±1.5 removed. d, Cloned chicken genes from chromosome 10 or 
chicken homologues of genes previously implicated with PB2 host range (underlined) 
expressed in 293T cells for 20hrs before transfection with pHOM1-firefly minigenome 
reporter, avian virus 50-92 polymerase (either PB2 627E (Black bars) or PB2 627K (grey 
bars)) and Renilla expression control. Luciferase activity was assayed after a further 24hrs. 
(Data are firefly activity normalised to Renilla; error as SEM; n=3 biological replicates; 
pattern of results consistent in at least three independent experiments).
