LixiLan-O Randomized Trial
Diabetes Care 2016;39:2026–2035 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-0917
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate efficacy and safety of LixiLan (iGlarLixi), a novel titratable fixed-ratio
combination of insulin glargine (iGlar) and lixisenatide (Lixi), compared with both
components, iGlar and Lixi, given separately in type 2 diabetes inadequately
controlled on metformin with or without a second oral glucose-lowering drug.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
After a 4-week run-in to optimize metformin and stop other oral antidiabetic
drugs, participants (N = 1,170, mean diabetes duration ∼8.8 years, BMI
∼31.7 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to open-label once-daily iGlarLixi or iGlar,
both titrated to fasting plasma glucose <100 mg/dL (<5.6 mmol/L) up to a maxi-
mum insulin dose of 60 units/day, or to once-daily Lixi (20 mg/day) while continuing
with metformin. The primary outcome was HbA1c change at 30 weeks.
RESULTS
Greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline (8.1% [65 mmol/mol]) were achieved
with iGlarLixi compared with iGlar and Lixi (21.6%, 21.3%, 20.9%, respectively),
reaching mean final HbA1c levels of 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) for iGlarLixi versus 6.8%
(51 mmol/mol) and 7.3% (56 mmol/mol) for iGlar and Lixi, respectively (both P <
0.0001). More subjects reached target HbA1c <7% with iGlarLixi (74%) versus iGlar
(59%) or Lixi (33%) (P < 0.0001 for all). Mean body weight decreased with iGlarLixi
(20.3 kg) and Lixi (22.3 kg) and increased with iGlar (+1.1 kg, difference 1.4 kg, P <
0.0001). Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (£70 mg/dL) was similar with
iGlarLixi and iGlar (1.4 and 1.2 events/patient-year) and lower with Lixi (0.3 events/
patient-year). iGlarLixi improved postprandial glycemic control versus iGlar and dem-
onstrated considerably fewer nausea (9.6%) and vomiting (3.2%) events than Lixi (24%
and 6.4%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS
iGlarLixi complemented iGlar and Lixi effects to achieve meaningful HbA1c re-
ductions, close to near normoglycemia without increases in either hypoglycemia
or weight, compared with iGlar, and had low gastrointestinal adverse effects
compared with Lixi.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THERAPEUTICS
 The most recent American Diabetes
Association/European Association for
the Study of Diabetes recommendations
suggest that if the individualized HbA1c
target is not achieved with lifestyle
modifications and metformin, a combi-
nation of metformin with any one of six
options should be considered, includ-
ing the choice of injectable basal insulin
or a GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) (1).
However, most clinicians and patients
prefer to choose dual or even triple oral
therapy before deciding between in-
jectable basal insulin and a GLP-1 RA
to reach the patient’s individualized
glycemic target.
Numerous reports have established
the value of basal insulin in achieving
HbA1c targets. Targets can be met with
basal insulin in 50–60% of people with
type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with oral
agents if the basal insulin is properly ti-
trated and especially when it is initiated
during the early stages of diabetes in
combination with metformin (2). Basal
insulin therapy improves glycemic con-
trol primarily by reducing nocturnal and
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (3). Post-
prandial plasma glucose (PPG) excursions
cannot be normalized or considerably im-
proved with basal insulin alone. Thus,
those 40–50% with type 2 diabetes who
are unable to achieve their individualized
glycemic targets with basal insulin alone
(4–6) can benefit from the addition of
PPG-lowering agents.
GLP-1 RAs stimulate postprandial in-
sulin secretion and suppress glucagon
release in a glucose-dependent fash-
ion, and short-acting agents like exena-
tide and lixisenatide (Lixi) have a
pronounced effect on delaying gastric
emptying, resulting in a robust lower-
ing of PPG (7). Numerous reports have
confirmed the HbA1c-lowering capabil-
ities of GLP-1 RAs when added to oral
agents in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes
alongside a low risk of hypoglycemia
and potential for weight reduction,
similar to basal insulin.
However, clinical inertia and aversion
to injectable therapy remain barriers for
the use of basal insulin and/or GLP-1 RAs
in type 2 diabetes. More specifically,
concerns about hypoglycemia risk and
weight gain (8,9) often delay insulin ini-
tiation for many years, and gastrointes-
tinal adverse events (GI AEs) such as
nausea and vomiting make GLP-1 RA in-
tolerable for some patients, prompting
low adherence and frequent drug dis-
continuation (10).
Lixi (Lyxumia; Sanofi, Paris, France) is a
once-daily, prandial GLP-1 RA with a pre-
dominant PPG-lowering effect mainly
through delayed gastric emptying and re-
duction of glucagon release (11). Lixi and
insulin glargine (iGlar) 100 units have sim-
ilar physicochemical features, allowing
both components to be mixed as a de-
fined fixed-ratio iGlar:Lixi formulation
(iGlarLixi or LixiLan) and delivered
through a single daily injection. iGlarLixi
can deliver iGlar over a range of 10–60
units/day in steps of 1 unit in a 2:1 or a
3:1 ratio with Lixi. For example, 2 units
iGlar will deliver 1 mg Lixi for pen A,
whereas for pen B, the 3:1 ratio results
in 3 units iGlar to 1 mg Lixi. The fixed-
ratio combination limits Lixi to a maxi-
mum dose of 20 mg/day and allows a
slow increase in the Lixi dose that fol-
lows the basal insulin titration.
The clinical rationale for the combina-
tion of basal insulin with a short-acting
GLP-1 RA is based on the complemen-
tary effects of the two agents and on the
potential for mitigating barriers to their
individual use; iGlar improves FPG, and
Lixi decreases PPG without increasing
hypoglycemia risk and may attenuate
the risk of weight gain experienced
with iGlar alone (3,12–16). In addition,
the known GI AEs of Lixi can potentially
be mitigated by the gradual Lixi dose
increments that follow iGlar titration,
which is guided solely by the FPG level
response and by hypoglycemia and GI
tolerance (1).
In a proof-of-concept study, iGlarLixi
(2 units iGlar to 1 mg Lixi) achieved ro-
bust HbA1c reductions, with weight
loss and no increased hypoglycemia
compared with iGlar, as well as a very
low frequency of GI AEs in patients
with type 2 diabetes inadequately
controlled on metformin (17). The
main objective of the LixiLan-O (Effi-
cacy and Safety of Insulin Glargine/
Lixisenatide Fixed Ratio Combination
Compared to Insulin Glargine Alone and
Lixisenatide Alone on Top of Metformin in
Patients With T2DM) study (NCT02058147)
was to further those findings by compar-
ing the effects of the titratable fixed-
ratio combination of LixiLan (iGlarLixi)
with iGlar or Lixi alone on glycemic con-
trol in a population of insulin-naive pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes inadequately
controlled on metformin with or without
another glucose-lowering agent, which
was discontinued at run-in.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Design
The LixiLan-O study was an open-label,
randomized, parallel-group, multina-
tional, multicenter phase III clinical trial
initiated (first patient enrolled) on
12 February 2014 and ending (last pa-
tient completed) on 17 June 2015.
Supplementary Fig. 1 summarizes the
study design. Patients (aged $18 years)
with type 2 diabetes diagnosed at least
1 year before screening were eligible if
they showed inadequate glycemic con-
trol despite being treated for at least
3 months with metformin with or with-
out a second oral glucose-lowering ther-
apy. Inadequate glycemic control was
defined as HbA1c $7.5% and #10.0%
(58–86 mmol/mol) for patients treated
with metformin alone and $7.0%
and #9.0% (53–75 mmol/mol) for those
previously treated with metformin and a
second oral glucose-lowering therapy,
namely a sulfonylurea, glinide, sodium-
glucose cotransporter 2, or dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 inhibitor.
Major exclusion criteria were use of
an oral agent other than the aforemen-
tioned during the 3 months before
screening, previous treatment with in-
sulin (except short-term treatment due
to intercurrent illness, including gesta-
tional diabetes mellitus), and previous
discontinuation of a GLP-1 RA due to
safety, tolerability, or lack of efficacy.
Additional exclusion criteria were amy-
lase and/or lipase more than three
times the upper limit of normal or
calcitonin $20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L).
Eligible patients entered a 4-week
run-in phase during which those re-
ceiving metformin plus another oral
glucose-lowering therapy at screening
were required to stop the second oral
agent at the start of the run-in. For all
patients, the dose of metformin was
titrated to at least 2,000 mg/day or to
the maximum tolerated dose, which
had to be $1,500 mg/day. At the end
of the run-in phase, patients with an
HbA1c $7.0% and #10.0% (53–86
mmol/mol), and an FPG #250 mg/dL
(#13.9 mmol/L) were randomly as-
signed in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive iGlarLixi,
iGlar, or Lixi, respectively, for 30 weeks,
stratified by HbA1c (,8%, $8% [,64,
$64 mmol/mol]) and for second oral

 glucose-lowering therapy use at screen-
ing (yes, no). An interactive voice/Web
response system generated patient
randomization. The study was designed
and monitored in accordance with
Good Clinical Practice, the International
Conference on Harmonization, and the
Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional re-
view boards or ethics committees at
each study site approved the protocol.
Each patient gave written informed
consent.
Interventions
iGlarLixi was administered once daily us-
ing one of two SoloSTAR (Sanofi) pen in-
jectors: pen A, with a 2:1 ratio of 2 units
iGlar to 1 mg Lixi, delivers corresponding
insulin doses from 10 to 40 units, allowing
administration of iGlarLixi doses from
10 units/5 mg up to 40 units/20 mg, and
pen B, with a 3:1 ratio of 3 units iGlar to
1 mg Lixi, delivers corresponding insulin
doses from 30 to 60 units, allowing ad-
ministration of iGlarLixi doses from
30 units/10 mg up to 60 units/20 mg. All
patients were started on pen A at 10 units
(10 units/5 mg) and continued on the
same pen A up to a dose of 40 units.
When patients required doses .40 units
(40 units/20 mg), they were switched to
pen B. Only the window for the insulin
dose was visible in both pens. Treatment
was titrated once a week to reach and
maintain a self-measured FPG of 80–
100 mg/dL (4.4–5.6 mmol/L) while avoid-
ing hypoglycemia. Titration for iGlarLixi
and iGlar by only 2–4 units weekly was
similarly guided only by the required
dose for iGlar onthe basisofthe following
algorithm: +2 units (if FPG was .100
and#140mg/dL[.5.6and#7.8mmol/L])
or +4 units (if FPG was .140 mg/dL
[.7.8 mmol/L]). The use of the two
pens allowed doses of the com-
ponent iGlar to be between 10 and 60
units/day while always limiting the Lixi
component to a maximum of 20 mg/day
regardless of the pen used. iGlarLixi was
self-administered once daily 0–60 min
before breakfast.
iGlar was supplied in a prefilled dis-
posable Lantus SoloSTAR (Sanofi U.S.
LLC, Bridgewater, NJ) pen injector
(100 units/mL). The pen can deliver
doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of
1 unit. In the current study, the maxi-
mum iGlar once-daily dose allowed was
60 units. Injection time was at the dis-
cretion of patients and investigators but
remained at about the same time through-
out treatment. The initial daily dose of
iGlar during the first week of treatment
was 10 units, and the titration regimen
was the same as for iGlarLixi.
Lixi was supplied in disposable pre-
filled pens containing 50 mg/mL for the
starting dose of 10 mg for the first
2 weeks and a different pen containing
100 mg/mL for the 20 mg maintenance
dose during the remainder of the study.
Lixi was self-administered once daily,
0–60 min before breakfast or the eve-
ning meal at the discretion of patients
and investigators but remained at about
the same time throughout treatment.
Efficacy End Points
The primary efficacy end point was
change in HbA1c from baseline to week
30. Changes in the following continuous
secondary efficacy end points from base-
line to week 30 were assessed: 2-h PPG
levels during a standardized meal test,
body weight, seven-point self-mea-
sured plasma glucose (SMPG) profiles,
and FPG.
Categorical secondary efficacy end
points at week 30 included percentages
of patients reaching HbA1c ,7% (53
mmol/mol) and #6.5% (48 mmol/mol),
composite end points of HbA1c ,7%
(53 mmol/mol) with no body weight
gain, HbA1c ,7% (53 mmol/mol) with
no documented symptomatic hypogly-
cemia (#70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) during
treatment,andHbA1c,7%(53mmol/mol)
with no body weight gain and with no
documented symptomatic hypoglyce-
mia. For seven-point SMPG profiles,
the average daily change from baseline
to week 30 and the change from base-
line to week 30 for each of the seven
points were evaluated.
Safety End Points
The safety end points assessed were
symptomatic hypoglycemia and AEs, in-
cluding allergic reactions, major cardio-
vascular events, and pancreatic events,
adjudicated by specific independent
committees. Severe symptomatic hypo-
glycemia was defined as requiring an-
other person’s assistance to actively
administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or
other resuscitative actions. Documen-
ted symptomatic hypoglycemia was
defined as typical symptoms of hypogly-
cemiaaccompaniedbyameasuredplasma
glucose concentration of #70 mg/dL
(3.9 mmol/L).
Laboratory safety variables analyzed
were hematology; clinical chemistry;
lipid parameters; serum amylase, li-
pase, and calcitonin levels; and urine
albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Clinical
safety was assessed by physical exam-
ination, systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, heart rate, and electrocardio-
graphic variables. Anti-Lixi antibodies
and/or anti-insulin antibodies were
measured at day 1 and at week 30 at
centralized laboratories using validated
assay methodologies.
Statistical Methods
Enrolling 450 patients in each of the
iGlarLixi and iGlar groups would pro-
vide .95% power to show noninferior-
ity of the iGlarLixi group to the iGlar
group in the HbA1c change from base-
line to week 30 on the basis of a true
difference between the two groups of
zero and a noninferiority upper margin
of 0.3% (SD 1.1%, 2.5% significance
level one-sided t test). A sample size of
450 patients in the iGlarLixi group and
225 patients in the Lixi group would
provide .95% power to detect a differ-
ence of 0.4% in the HbA1c change from
baseline to week 30 between the
groups (SD 1.1%, 5% significance level
two-sided t test).
Efficacy analyses were evaluated
with a modified intent-to-treat (mITT)
population of all randomly assigned pa-
tients who had a baseline assessment
and at least one postbaseline assess-
ment of any primary or secondary effi-
cacy variables. The primary efficacy end
point was analyzed by a mixed-effect
model with repeated measures that in-
cluded the treatment groups, randomi-
zation strata, visit, treatment-by-visit
interaction, and country as fixed-effect
factors and the baseline HbA1c-by-visit
interaction as covariates. The adjusted
mean change in HbA1c from baseline to
week 30 for each treatment group was
estimated as well as the between-group
difference and the 95% CI for the ad-
justed mean. A similar mixed-effect model
with repeated measures or ANCOVA was
applied for continuous secondary efficacy
end points, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel
method stratified by randomization strata
was applied on categorical efficacy end
points.
The coprimary hypotheses of statistical
superiority of iGlarLixi to Lixi alone and
noninferiority of iGlarLixi to iGlar alone

 were tested for the primary efficacy end
point. Both coprimary hypotheses were
required to be established for the primary
efficacy end point before the step-down
testing procedure for the secondary effi-
cacy end points, and a test of superiority
of iGlarLixi over iGlar alone was per-
formed at an a-level of 0.05 (two-sided).
An estimate of the composite end
point of HbA1c ,7% (53 mmol/mol)
at week 30 with no documented symp-
tomatic hypoglycemia in the iGlarLixi
group versus iGlar or Lixi was made.
This exploratory composite end point
was not included in the testing order.
The safety population was defined
as all randomly assigned patients
who received at least one dose of
open-label iGlarLixi, iGlar, or Lixi regard-
less of the amount of treatment admin-
istered. Patients were analyzed for
safety according to the treatment re-
ceived rather than the group to which
they were assigned.
RESULTS
Patient Disposition and Baseline
Characteristics
A total of 1,170 patients were randomly
assigned at 240 centers in 23 countries,
with 469 patients assigned to the iGlarLixi
group, 467 to the iGlar group, and 234 to
the Lixi group (Supplementary Fig. 2). The
mITT and safety populations included
1,167 and 1,169 patients, respectively.
Demographics and baseline characteris-
tics were similar across the treatment
groups (Table 1). Patients had an average
age of 58 years, were predominantly Cau-
casian (;90%), were overweightorobese
(BMI ;32 kg/m2), and had a mean dura-
tion of diabetes of ;9 years.
Primary Efficacy End Point
Baseline HbA1c was 8.1% (65 mmol/mol)
in all three groups. Mean HbA1c levels
achieved at week 30 were 6.5% (48
mmol/mol) for iGlarLixi, 6.8% (51
mmol/mol) for iGlar, and 7.3% (56
mmol/mol) for Lixi (Fig. 1A). The least
squares (LS) mean changes from base-
line to week 30 in HbA1c were 21.63%
for iGlarLixi, 21.34% for iGlar, and
20.85% for Lixi (Table 2 and Fig. 1B).
Statistical superiority of iGlarLixi over
Lixi was demonstrated for the change in
HbA1c from baseline to week 30 (LS mean
differencevs.Lixi20.8%[28.5mmol/mol]
[95% CI 20.9 to 20.7% (29.8 to 27.3
mmol/mol)], P , 0.0001). The LS mean
HbA1c difference at week 30 bet-
ween iGlarLixi and iGlar (20.3% [23.2
mmol/mol] [95% CI 20.4 to 20.2%
(24.2 to 22.1 mmol/mol)], P , 0.0001)
met noninferiority of iGlarLixi compared
with iGlar and demonstrated superiority
for this primary efficacy end point (P ,
0.0001) on the basis of the step-down
testing procedure.
Secondary Efficacy End Points
A significantly higher proportion of pa-
tients in the iGlarLixi group (74%)
reached the HbA1c target of ,7%
(53 mmol/mol) compared with patients
receiving iGlar (59%) or Lixi (33%), or the
HbA1c target of #6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
(P , 0.0001 for all comparisons) (Table
2). Body weight increased in the iGlar
group (+1.1 kg) and decreased in the
iGlarLixi (–0.3 kg) and Lixi (–2.3 kg)
groups. A significant difference of
1.4 kg in body weight change from base-
line to week 30 was found between the
iGlarLixi and iGlar groups (P , 0.0001)
(Table 2 and Fig. 1C).
The LS mean reduction from baseline
to week 30 in FPG was similar in the
iGlarLixi and iGlar groups, reflecting sim-
ilar basal insulin titration in both groups,
but was smaller with Lixi (Table 2 and
Fig. 1D). In addition, iGlarLixi substan-
tially improved 2-h PPG compared
with iGlar after a standardized breakfast
(Table 2 and Fig. 1E).
Patients treated with iGlarLixi had a sig-
nificantly greater decrease in average
seven-point SMPG profile compared
with those treated with iGlar (LS mean
difference 212.5 mg/dL [20.69 mmol/L]
[95% CI 216.1 to 28.9 mg/dL (20.89 to
20.50 mmol/L)], P , 0.0001) and Lixi
(225.2 mg/dL [21.40 mmol/L] [95%

 with no body weight gain and with no
documented symptomatic hypoglycemia
(#70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) during the
study. By week 30, a higher proportion
ofpatients receivingiGlarLixialso reached
the composite end point of HbA1c ,7%
(53 mmol/mol) with no documented
symptomatic hypoglycemia (54% for
iGlarLixi vs. 44% and 31% for iGlar and
Lixi, respectively).
The final mean basal insulin daily
dose was similar between the iGlarLixi
group (39.8 6 14.9 units) and the iGlar
group (40.3 6 14.9 units) determined
by the FPG titration. The analysis of the
percentage of patients by average daily
iGlar dose category at week 30 showed
that the proportion of patients per
dose category was generally similar be-
tween the two treatment groups. The
majority of patients in both treat-
ment groups had a final daily insulin
dose $30 units and #60 units (71%
in the iGlarLixi group, 70% in the iGlar
group) with 44% and 45% receiv-
ing .40 to #60 units; only 16%
and 20% received the maximum per-
missible dose of 60 units of insulin,
respectively.
Safety Profile
Hypoglycemia
The incidence of symptomatic docu-
mented hypoglycemia (#70 mg/dL)
was similar with iGlarLixi and iGlar
(26% and 24%, respectively) (Table 3).
The corresponding number of events
per patient-year was generally low and
comparable between the two groups
(1.4 and 1.2 for iGlarLixi and iGlar, re-
spectively). The incidence and event
rates were lower in the Lixi group (6%,
0.3 events/patient-year). One severe
symptomatic hypoglycemic episode
was reported, which occurred in the
iGlar group.
Overall Safety
All treatments were well tolerated. The
safety profile of iGlarLixi reflected the
established safety profiles of its com-
ponents except for considerably fewer
GI AEs compared with Lixi (Table 3).
Most AEs were considered mild or
moderate in intensity. Nausea (9.6%,
24.0%) and diarrhea (both 9.0%) were
the most frequent GI AEs associated
with the iGlarLixi and Lixi groups, re-
spectively; these subsided over time
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Vomiting was

 also less common with iGlarLixi than
with Lixi (3.2% vs. 6.4%). Adjudicated
allergic reactions and major cardiovas-
cular events occurred in low percent-
ages of patients in all three treatment
groups. No events were adjudicated as
pancreatitis in any treatment group.
One patient in the iGlar group had pan-
creatic cancer.
A similar proportion of patients report-
ed serious AEs across the three treatment
groups (Table 3). A higher proportion of
patients withdrew from the Lixi group
(9.0%) due to AEs than from the iGlarLixi
(2.6%) or iGlar (1.9%) groups. A higher
proportion of withdrawals followed GI
AEs in the Lixi group than in the iGlarLixi
and iGlar groups (Table 3).
The proportions of patients with any
AEs adjudicated as allergic reactions
were low and similar among groups
(1.3%, 0.6%, and 0.9% in the iGlarLixi,
iGlar, and Lixi groups, respectively). In
the iGlarLixi group, three cases (0.6%)
of urticaria were adjudicated as possibly
related to study drug, and three cases
(0.6%) of angioedema were adjudicated
as not related. In the iGlar group, no
event was adjudicated as related, and
in the Lixi group, one case of urticaria
(0.4%) and one case of anaphylaxis
(0.4%) were classified as possibly re-
lated to study drug. With regard to
positively adjudicated cardiovascular
events, two patients experienced events
in the iGlarLixi group (one cardiovascu-
lar death and one unstable angina),
seven in the iGlar group (two cardiovas-
cular deaths; two hospitalizations for
heart failure; and one each of nonfatal
stroke, unstable angina, and coronary
revascularization procedure), and two
in the Lixi group (one cardiovascular
death and one nonfatal stroke). No clin-
ically significant safety issues were iden-
tified on the basis of a review of clinical
laboratory parameters (including lipase,
amylase, and calcitonin) (Supplementary
Table 1), vital signs, physical examina-
tions, electrocardiograms, and antibody
levels or compared with AEs in antibody-
positive and antibody-negative popula-
tions (data not shown).
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates that LixiLan
(iGlarLixi), a novel titratable fixed-ratio
combination of iGlar and Lixi, is more ef-
fective in achieving meaningful improve-
ments in glycemic control than iGlar or
Lixi alone, reaching a near-normal HbA1c
level of 6.5%, which was attained with no
weight gain and without increasing the
risk of hypoglycemia, thus contrasting
with the known outcomes in insulin-naive
patients with type 2 diabetes initiating
basal insulin treatment. Most treat-to-
target trials using basal insulin in insulin-
naive patients have achieved HbA1c levels
in the 7.0–7.3% range (53–56 mmol/mol)
(18–20), have reported weight gain, and,
depending on the type of insulin and
HbA1c achieved, most found significant
rates of hypoglycemia. Of note, the iGlar
group in the current trial achieved an un-
usual HbA1c level of 6.8% (51 mmol/mol),
attesting to a well-conducted study with
insulin optimization, but still, iGlarLixi
achieved further HbA1c reductions. More-
over, iGlarLixi was not associated with the
weight gain often seen with the initiation
of insulin therapy and showed no in-
creased risk of hypoglycemia despite the
lower HbA1c levels compared with iGlar,
while being associated with considerably
fewer nausea and vomiting events than
Lixi. The improvement in HbA1c was also
reflected in the substantially higher pro-
portion of iGlarLixi-treated patients (74%)
reaching the HbA1c target of ,7.0% ver-
sus patients in the iGlar (59%) and Lixi
(33%) groups.
Fear of weight gain and hypoglycemia
are some of the reasons why insulin-
naive patients and their physicians may
resist initiating insulin treatment de-
spite poor glycemic control (13). In the
current study, the Lixi component of
iGlarLixi prevented the potential for
weight gain classically seen with the in-
troduction of insulin, with a significant
weight difference of 1.4 kg between the
iGlarLixi and iGlar arms (P , 0.0001). The
composite end points further confirmed
that the glycemic control achieved with
iGlarLixi did not come with the burden
of increased body weight: 43% of patients
achieved HbA1c ,7% with noweight gain.
Glycemic control with iGlarLixi was also
achieved without increasing the risk of
hypoglycemia compared with iGlar: the
number of documented symptomatic hy-
poglycemia events per patient-year was
generally low and comparable between
iGlarLixi and iGlar (1.4 and 1.2, respec-
tively), and no severe hypoglycemic
events occurred in the iGlarLixi group.
Most notably, iGlarLixi had markedly
lower rates of nausea (9.6%) and vomit-
ing (3.2%) than Lixi (nausea 24.0%,

 vomiting 6.4%), leading to fewer perma-
nent treatment discontinuations and
better tolerance. The rate of nausea
in the iGlarLixi group was also lower
than that observed in previous studies
where Lixi was coadministered with
basal insulin as a separate injection
(25–27% and 8–9%, respectively)
(14,15,21). These findings are likely a re-
sult of the gradual small increases of the
Lixi dose parallel to the iGlar titration
according to fasting glucose targets,
mitigating the risk of GI AEs seen
when Lixi is administered separately
in a fixed-dose fashion. This low fre-
quency of GI AEs confirms the findings
of the iGlarLixi proof-of-concept study
in which the rates of nausea and vom-
iting were 7.5% and 2.5%, respec-
tively (17).
The current study did not compare
the efficacy of the fixed-ratio combina-
tion with that of a regimen consisting of
basal insulin with a GLP-1 RA added as a
separate injection. However, a cautious
indirect comparison suggests that the
sequential administration of basal insu-
lin given first followed by the addition
of a GLP-1 RA in insulin-naive patients
with type 2 diabetes on metformin does
not appear to achieve the same robust
improvements in glycemic control as
the simultaneous administration of
both components demonstrated in
this study. Perhaps, to support the hy-
pothesis that simultaneous administra-
tion with iGlarLixi is more effective and
better tolerated than sequentially adding
Lixi to basal insulin, the findings of the
GetGoal-Duo 1 study may provide some
valid hints. Although not directly com-
parable, in part due to no capping (free
titration) of iGlar dose, the GetGoal-
Duo 1 study in a similar patient popula-
tion, which started basal iGlar first and
then added Lixi 3 months later in those
whose HbA1c was .7%, achieved a final
HbA1c of 7.0%, and 56% of participants
reached HbA1c ,7% by using the se-
quential regimen (10). In the current
study, however, the final HbA1c was
6.5%, and 74% of patients reached the
goal of HbA1c ,7%. A head-to-head trial
comparing the efficacy of iGlarLixi with
that of a sequential basal insulin-GLP-1
RA approach has not been conducted
and would be needed to determine
any additional benefit of the fixed-
ratio combination. Nevertheless, the
LixiLan-O data challenge the current
treatment paradigm of type 2 diabetes,
which continues to rely on the sequen-
tial addition of therapies to control
blood glucose levels, and provide evi-
dence for the value of a titratable
fixed-ratio combination of injectable
agents with complementary actions to
achieve stronger efficacy and poten-
tially better compliance (1).
Studies of other fixed-ratio combina-
tions of basal insulin and a GLP-1 RA
have produced fairly similar results. The
DUAL 1 study (NCT01336023) showed that
a fixed-ratio combination of basal insulin
degludec and the GLP-1 RA liraglutide
(IDegLira) substantially improved glycemic
control compared with each of its com-
ponents. After 26 weeks, mean HbA1c
decreased from a baseline of 8.3%
(67 mmol/mol) to 6.4% (46 mmol/mol)
with IDegLira, compared with 6.9%
(52 mmol/mol) with insulin degludec
and 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) with liraglu-
tide. As in the current study, GI AEs
developed in a lower proportion of pa-
tients receiving the fixed-ratio combina-
tion compared with those receiving
liraglutide alone (22). However, the
GLP-1 RA component of IDegLira
has a different mode of action from
that of iGlarLixi in that liraglutide po-
tentiates the FPG control of degludec,
whereas Lixi targets postprandial glu-
cose levels.
Limitations of the current study in-
clude its open-label design. However,
the differences in administration pat-
terns of the injectable interventions
meant that a double-blind study design
would have been impractical. An addi-
tional limitation is the 30-week study
duration; longer trials will be needed
to assess durability of the glucose-
lowering effects.

 as basal insulin or a GLP-1 RA, are appro-
priate as add-on therapies in patients
with type 2 diabetes inadequately con-
trolled on metformin alone or in com-
bination with other oral agents (1).
Considerable time and energy have
been devoted to debating the decision-
making process for selecting the first in-
jectable agent, weighing the pros and
cons of basal insulin or a GLP-1 RA for
achieving individualized glycemic targets
limited both by specific barriers and by
misconceptions, safety profiles, and clin-
ical inertia. The use of titratable fixed-
ratio formulations of basal insulin
with a GLP-1 RA proposes a new treat-
ment paradigm that takes advantage of
the complementary action of these two
therapies while mitigating AEs, in a ma-
jority of patients, reaching robust
HbA1c reductions to levels previously
unattainable with any of the individual
therapies.
In conclusion, insulin-naive patients
with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes ran-
domly assigned to LixiLan (iGlarLixi)
achieved near-normoglycemic control
with modest weight loss (mitigating
the weight gain observed with iGlar
alone), saw no increase in hypoglyce-
mia risk compared with iGlar, and had
low levels of GI AEs compared with Lixi.
These findings support revisiting the
treatment paradigm and, potentially,
moving away from the sequential addi-
tion of injectable therapies toward the
use of a titratable fixed-ratio combina-
tion of basal insulin and GLP-1 RA ther-
apy in the same formulation.
