IMPORTANCE Aromatase inhibitors (AI) are associated with significant urogenital atrophy,
affecting quality of life and drug compliance.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate safety of intravaginal testosterone cream (IVT) or an
estradiol-releasing vaginal ring (7.5 μg/d) in patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC)
receiving an AI. Intervention was considered unsafe if more than 25% of patients had
persistent elevation in estradiol (E2), defined as E2 greater than 10 pg/mL (to convert to
pmol/L, multiply by 3.671) and at least 10 pg/mL above baseline after treatment initiation
on 2 consecutive tests at least 2 weeks apart.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Postmenopausal (PM) women with hormone receptor
(HR)–positive stage I to III BC taking AIs with self-reported vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, or
decreased libido were randomized to 12 weeks of IVT or an estradiol vaginal ring. Estradiol
was measured at baseline and weeks 4 and 12 using a commercially available liquid
chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assay; follicle-stimulating hormone levels
were measured at baseline and week 4. Gynecologic examinations and sexual quality-of-life
questionnaires were completed at baseline and week 12. This randomized noncomparative
design allowed safety evaluation of 2 interventions concurrently in the same population of
patients, reducing the possibility of E2 assay variability over time and between the 2
interventions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate safety of
IVT or an estradiol vaginal ring in patients with early-stage BC receiving an AI; secondary
objectives included evaluation of adverse events, changes in sexual quality of life using the
Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System sexuality subscales, changes in vaginal atrophy using
a validated 4-point scale, and comparison of E2 levels.
RESULTS Overall, 76 women signed consent (mean [range] age, 56 [37-78] years), 75 started
treatment, and 69 completed 12 weeks of treatment. Mean (range) baseline E2 was 20 (<2 to
127) pg/mL. At baseline, E2 was above the postmenopausal range (>10 pg/mL) in 28 of 76
women (37%). Persistent E2 elevation was observed in none with a vaginal ring and in 4 of
34 women (12%) with IVT. Transient E2 elevation was seen in 4 of 35 (11%) with a vaginal ring
and in 4 of 34 (12%) with IVT. Vaginal atrophy and sexual interest and dysfunction improved
for all patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In PM women with early-stage BC receiving AIs, treatment
with a vaginal ring or IVT over 12 weeks met the primary safety end point. Baseline elevation
in E2 was common and complicates this assessment. Vaginal atrophy, sexual interest, and
sexual dysfunction were improved. Further study is required to understand E2 variability in
this setting.

A
romatase inhibitors (AIs) are the preferred adjuvant
therapy for postmenopausal (PM) women with hor-
mone receptor–positive (HR+) early-stage breast can-
cer (BC).1,2 Vaginal dryness and decreased libido may lead to
poor compliance and early discontinuation, and may ad-
versely affect quality of life (QOL).3,4 Sexual dysfunction in pa-
tients taking AIs is common, with up to 50% reporting low
sexual interest and 74% reporting insufficient lubrication.5
Vaginal estrogens are an effective treatment for urogeni-
tal atrophy, but safety is uncertain in patients with BC due to
potentialsystemicabsorption.Elevatedestradiol(E2)wasdocu-
mented in patients taking AIs using the 25-μg Vagifem (Novo
Nordisk) insert.6 Estring 2 mg (Pfizer), a 17 β-estradiol–

were observed in PM women at high risk for or with a history
ofHR+breastcancer.8Vaginaltestosteronecreamhasalsobeen

cacy of intravaginal testosterone cream (IVT) or a vaginal ring

Methods
The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate safety of
IVT or a vaginal ring in patients with early-stage BC receiving
an AI. Intervention was considered unsafe if more than 25%
of patients had persistent elevation in E2, defined as E2
greater than 10 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by
3.671) and at least 10 pg/mL above baseline after treatment
initiation on 2 consecutive tests at least 2 weeks apart. Defi-
nition of transient elevation in E2 was elevation without con-
firmation on consecutive blood draw with ongoing use of
assigned product.
Secondary objectives included evaluation of adverse
events, changes in sexual QOL using the Cancer Rehabilita-
tion Evaluation System sexuality subscales,13 changes in vagi-
nal atrophy using a validated 4-point scale,14,15 and compari-
son of E2 measured by a commercially available LC/MS assay
or RIA.
The trial protocol is available in Supplement 1.
Patients
The study was approved by the University of California-San
Francisco (UCSF) Committee on Human Research. All pa-
tients provided written informed consent. Eligible patients in-
cluded PM women with stage I to III HR+ BC treated with at
least 30 days of AI who also had vaginal dryness, dyspareu-
nia,ordecreasedlibido.Postmenopausalwasdefinedasamen-
orrhea for at least 12 months in the absence of chemotherapy
or bilateral oophorectomy. Women with chemotherapy-
induced amenorrhea within 2 years of study entry, or pre-
menopausalwomenreceivingovariansuppressionandAIwere
eligible providing E2 was 10 pg/mL or less during the 30-day
screening period. Exclusion criteria included history of vagi-
nal or vulvar radiation, gynecologic cancer, abnormal pap
smear test within 1 year, or concurrent estrogen or androgen
treatmentwithin30days.Initiationoftopicalmoisturizerswas
prohibited, although continuation of previously used prod-
ucts was permitted.
Treatment
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive IVT or a vaginal ring
for 12 weeks. Intravaginal testosterone cream was prepared by
the UCSF Drug Product Services Laboratory as follows: mi-
cronized, United States Pharmacopeia (USP)-grade testoste-
rone powder (synonym 4-Androsten-17β-ol-3-one) was levi-
gated with USP-grade mineral oil to form a paste, mixed with
a water-miscible odorless compounding vehicle (Velvachol),
to produce a 1% IVT concentration. Patients were instructed
to insert 0.5 mg of cream vaginally using a calibrated applica-
tor daily for 2 weeks, then 0.5 mg 3 times a week for the re-
maining 10 weeks. After 24 patients were enrolled, the proto-
col was amended to reduce the frequency of IVT insertion to
3 times per week for patient convenience.
Estring 2 mg is a silicone ring for vaginal insertion that re-
leases 7.5 μg of estradiol every 24 hours for 90 days. Partici-
pants or a study investigator inserted the ring on day 1.
Measurements
A commercially available ultrasensitive LC/MS method was
used to measure E2 at baseline, 4, and 12 weeks (Quest
Diagnostics)16; those randomized to IVT also had serum
ultrasensitive total testosterone levels measured (Quest
Diagnostics).17PatientswerenotifiediftheirE2wasgreaterthan
10 pg/mL and were given the opportunity to withdraw from
study. Patients with E2 greater than 10 pg/mL at week 4 or 12,
or with a greater than 10 pg/mL increase in E2 (if baseline was
Key Points
Question Does the use of an estradiol-releasing vaginal ring
(7.5 μg/d) or intravaginal testosterone cream (IVT) lead to
elevation in systemic estradiol in postmenopausal patients with
breast cancer using aromatase inhibitors?
Findings In this randomized, noncomparative trial, persistent
estradiol elevation was observed in no patients using a vaginal ring
and in a small portion of IVT patients. Vaginal atrophy, sexual
interest, and sexual dysfunction improved in both groups.
Meaning Persistent estradiol elevation was rare among patients
with breast cancer on aromatase inhibitors using a vaginal ring or
IVT, and use of these products is reasonable to consider for
patients experiencing urogenital atrophy.

>10 pg/mL) had E2 drawn between weeks 6 to 8 (for week 4
elevations), or weeks 14 to 18 (for week 12 elevations). Base-
line follicle-stimulating hormone levels were measured in a
subset of patients.
Gynecologic examination was performed at baseline and
week 12 or at end of study therapy. Vaginal epithelium was as-
sessed using a 4-point scale evaluating rugae, pallor, pete-
chiae, elasticity, and dryness. Changes were characterized as
none, mild, moderate, or severe compared with normal
epithelium.14,15 Patients completed the Cancer Rehabilita-
tion Evaluation System sexual interest and sexual dysfunc-
tion subscales13 and single-item sexual satisfaction at base-
line, week 4, and week 12.
Adverseeventsweremonitoredbytelephoneatweek4and
at the week 12 visit and graded using the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE) version 3.
Statistical Methods
This was an open-label, noncomparative phase 2 trial de-
signed to test the null hypothesis that each treatment is un-
safe (as defined in the Methods section) at a 5% level of
significance.
Randomization was performed by the study coordinator
in permuted blocks accounting for use of antidepressants and
relationship status (single vs partnered) to balance for poten-
tial confounding factors. Each treatment arm was evaluated
separately, with an early stopping rule if more than 25% of pa-
tients in either arm had persistent E2 elevation. With 35 pa-
tients in each arm, the trial was designed to have a 98% power
of concluding treatment is safe if the true failure rate is 5% and
70% power when the true failure rate is 10%.
Changes between baseline and week 12 individual and
composite vaginal atrophy scores were compared using stan-
dard t tests. Changes in the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation
System sexual interest and dysfunction subscales, and single
item sexual satisfaction were calculated for each arm. Ad-
verse events and reasons for treatment discontinuation were
collected at baseline and weeks 4 and 12.
Results
Patient Population and Tolerability
Seventy-six patients were enrolled between October 2007 and
June2011.Sixty-ninepatients(35vaginalringand34IVT)com-
pleted 12 weeks of treatment, and 68 patients (35 vaginal ring
and33IVT)wereevaluablefortheprimaryendpoint(Figure1).
Baseline characteristics were well balanced (eTable 1 in
Supplement 2). One patient randomized to the vaginal ring
signed consent but did not start treatment. Four patients dis-
continued the vaginal ring (2 patients during week 3 for in-
ability to maintain ring in vaginal vault, 1 patient during week
3 for vaginal odor/discomfort, and 1 patient during week 8 for
a family emergency). Two patients discontinued IVT (1 pa-
tient for a herpes outbreak with vulvar cellulitis at week 3, and
another patient due to concern related to increase in week-4
E2 to 20 pg/mL). One IVT patient was lost to follow-up after
week 12 with E2 of 22 pg/mL.
Baseline Levels of Estradiol
At baseline, mean and median E2 were 20 pg/mL and 6 pg/mL
(range, <2 to 127 pg/mL), respectively, and were similar in the
6 patients receiving ovarian suppression plus AI. Mean base-
line E2 was 26.8 pg/mL (95% CI, 14.5-39.1 pg/mL) for the vagi-
nal ring and 9.0 pg/mL (95% CI, 5.1-12.9 pg/mL) for IVT pa-
tients (P = .04). Baseline E2 was elevated in 37% of patients (19
of 40 [48%] with the vaginal ring and 9 of 36 [25%] with IVT;
χ2 P < .05); eTable 2 in Supplement 2 describes the character-
istics of patients with baseline elevations. One patient who un-

inthePMrangedespitevaginalringtreatment.Baselinefollicle-
stimulating hormone levels were PM in 21 of 24 patients (88%)
with baseline E2 elevation. Three patients with premeno-
pausalfollicle-stimulatinghormonelevelswerereceivingovar-
ian suppression plus AI and met eligibility criteria with a PM
E2 (<10 pg/mL) during screening, with low-level E2 elevation
onday1rangingfrom11pg/mLto16pg/mL.Noassociationwas
found between baseline E2 and age, weight, AI type, or body
mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) for all enrolled patients.
Persistent and Transient Elevations in Estradiol
Both treatment arms met the protocol defined primary safety
endpoint. Figure 2 shows the individual values and mean E2
at each time point for patients completing 12 weeks of therapy.
For the vaginal ring, 4 of 35 patients (11%) experienced a tran-
sient E2 elevation (range, 11-29 pg/mL), and none had persis-
tent elevations. For IVT, 4 of 34 patients (12%) had persistent
elevation (range, 16-45 pg/mL) and another 4 of 34 patients
(12%) had transient E2 elevation (range, 11-113 pg/mL). Al-
though there was no protocol defined plan to compare treat-
ment arms, more IVT patients had persistent E2 elevation than
patients using the vaginal ring (4 vs 0). One vaginal ring pa-
tient and 1 IVT patient had isolated week-4 E2 elevations. Two
patients using the vaginal ring and 1 IVT patient had an el-
evated week-12 E2 that dropped at week 14 to 18 following
treatment discontinuation. In 1 IVT patient, week 4 E2 was
23 pg/mL, fell to less than 2 pg/mL at week 6, but increased to
22 pg/mL at week 12 with continued IVT use. The patient was
subsequentlylosttofollow-up.Estradiollevelsinpatientswith
a protocol defined elevation are detailed in eTable 3 in
Supplement 2. There was no relationship between baseline E2
and subsequent elevations. Only 1 patient with baseline E2 el-
evation experienced a subsequent protocol-defined eleva-
tion—an IVT patient with baseline E2 of 31 pg/mL increasing
to 113 pg/mL at week 4. She elected to remain on study; week
6 E2 was 11 pg/mL.
Elevations in Testosterone
Mean and median baseline total testosterone levels mea-
sured in 27 IVT patients were 33 ng/dL (to convert to nmol/L,
multiply by 0.0347) and 27 ng/dL, respectively. Mean and me-
dian testosterone levels increased to 186 ng/dL and 82 ng/dL
at week 4 and then fell to 171 ng/dL and 67 ng/dL at week 12.
Elevations in total testosterone outside the normal female PM
range (2 ng/dL-45 ng/dl) were common with only 3 of 27 pa-
tients remaining in the PM range at both time points (eFigure
1 in Supplement 2).

respectively); baseline E2 was highly correlated between tests
(Pearsonr = 0.78;P < .001andSpearmanρ = 0.43;P < .001).For
patients with matched samples, baseline E2 was above PM in 9
of 63 patients (14%; all vaginal ring) by RIA, and in 25 of 63 pa-
tients (39%; 16 vaginal ring, 9 IVT) by LC/MS. Discordant E2 el-

in 19% of patients, compared with 1.5% by RIA.

Sixty-nine patients had baseline and week 12 vaginal atrophy
evaluations (Figure 3). Individual and composite scores im-
proved from baseline to week 12 for both vaginal ring and IVT.
In patients using the vaginal ring, atrophy scores (lower score
represents improvement) for rugae declined from 1.6 to 0.6,
pallor from 1.4 to 0.6, petechiae from 1.1 to 0.1, elasticity from

ity from 1.2 to 0.4, and dryness from 1.5 to 0.8 (P < .001 for all

Sexual Quality of Life
Sixty-two patients completed all questionnaires (32 vaginal

the vaginal ring, mean (SD) sexual interest improved from 1.2
(0.9) at baseline to 0.9 (0.7) at week 12 (P = .021) and for IVT
patients, from 1.4 (0.8) to 1.0 (0.6) (P = .02). Mean (SD) sexual
dysfunction improved from 2.9 (1.1) at baseline to 2.0 (1.1) at
week 12 in vaginal ring patients and from 2.9 (0.8) to 1.9 (1.1)
in IVT patients (both P < .001). Mean (SD) single-item Cancer

(Figure 4; eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
Toxic Effects
All treatment-related adverse events were grade 1 or 2. Events
occurring in more than 2% of participants included vaginal dis-
charge (4 vaginal ring, 2 IVT [8% overall]), facial hair growth
(1 vaginal ring, 5 IVT [8% overall]), vaginal or vulvar itching
and/or irritation (4 vaginal ring [5% overall]), vaginal odor
(3 IVT [4% overall]), and urinary tract or yeast infection (1 vagi-
nalring,3IVT[5%overall]).Twopatientsdiscontinuedtherapy
for toxic effects (vaginal odor or irritation in vaginal ring and
vulvar irritation in IVT).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date describing
changes in E2, vaginal atrophy, and sexual quality of life in pa-
tients with BC using the vaginal ring or IVT for AI-related uro-
genital symptoms. Both the vaginal ring and IVT met the pro-
tocol-defined primary safety end point with 12% modest
sustained E2 elevations with IVT compared with none with the
vaginal ring.
Safety of vaginal testosterone for treating urogenital
atrophy was previously evaluated in 21 patients with BC
taking AIs.8 Using a lower dose of testosterone propionate
(150-300 μg daily), no significant E2 elevation was reported at
4 weeks. The higher dose in our study (5000 μg 3 times/week)
wasbasedondatatreatingsexualdesiredisordersinPMwomen18
and resulted in testosterone levels above PM in most patients.
While elevated testosterone levels may increase risk for BC,19
higherbaselinetestosteronelevelswerenotassociatedwithrisk
of recurrence in the WHEL study.20
Surprisingly, 37% of patients had elevated E2 at baseline by
LC/MS. These results are intriguing, particularly given that 21%
with elevated baseline E2 had undergone oophorectomy, and
mosthadPMfollicle-stimulatinghormonelevels.Thereasonfor
thesignificantdifferenceinelevatedbaselineE2betweentreat-
ment arms is unclear because the arms were evenly paired for
age,causeofmenopause,BMI,race,andtimeonAI.Higherthan
expectedE2levelsinAI-treatedpatientshasbeenreported,21al-
thoughnolargetrialcomparingAIswithtamoxifeninPMpatients
has measured baseline or longitudinal E2 levels.
Potential explanations for baseline E2 elevations include
sporadic residual ovarian function or use of estrogen-
containingsupplements.Aromataseinhibitorcompliancecould
have contributed to E2 variations, but this data was not for-
mallycollected.Althoughtheprotocolexcludedtreatmentwith
oral,injectable,ortopicalformofestrogenorandrogentherapy
including natural supplements marketed as hormone replace-
ment products, we did not specifically query on use of herbs.
Use of dietary phytoestrogens and supplements including eve-
ning primrose, black cohosh, red clover extract, flaxseed, and
wild yam is extremely common among patients with BC. Other
less well-known products including epimedium, rehmannia,
deer antler velvet, and cordyceps have estrogenic activity, and
some have been demonstrated to contain E2 and increase se-
rumE2uponconsumption.22-24Lackofregulatoryoversightand
unclear labeling makes it difficult to monitor the content and
safetyofsupplementsandherbs,andcontaminationwithnatu-
ralorsyntheticestrogensincomplementarytherapieshasbeen
documented.25 The presence of significant estrogen levels has
been reported in youth-enhancing skin care products, none of
which listed estrogenic molecules on their ingredient list.26
Affected patients were informed of their elevated base-
line E2 and were advised to avoid supplements that might con-
tain estrogen. All opted to continue study treatment. Subse-
quently, week-4 E2 was lower in 27 of 28 patients (96%) with
baseline elevation, and only 5 of 28 (18%) had week-4 E2 above
10 pg/mL. The effect of sporadic E2 variations, use of herbs
and/or supplements, and compliance will be even more im-
portantwithincreasedAIuseinpremenopausalpatientsbased
on data from the SOFT trial.27 In the SOFT-EST substudy, over
17% of patients receiving triptorelin plus exemestane had an
E2 above the PM threshold at 1 or more time points,27 demon-
strating that chemical ovarian suppression is inconsistent.

We found that results from a commercially available ul-
trasensitive E2 assay (LC/MS) were largely concordant with
those from an ultrasensitive RIA. Estradiol elevations were
more frequently detected by LC/MS than RIA, where half were
only modestly increased above PM range (14 of 28 of baseline
E2 elevations by LC/MS were ≤20 pg/mL).
Both the vaginal ring and IVT improved vaginal atrophy,
sexual interest, and desire, while only the vaginal ring im-
proved sexual satisfaction. At the end of 12 weeks, patients had
worse values for sexual interest, dysfunction, and satisfaction
than previously reported in patients with BC several years out
fromacutetreatment,manyofwhomwerestillontamoxifen.28
This is likely owing to the greater effect of AIs on sexual func-
tion, as was observed in the SOFT27 and TEXT trials.29
The American Menopausal Society and American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that in pa-
tients with a history of estrogen-sensitive cancers, nonhor-
monal options including vaginal moisturizers, pH balanced
gels, topical oils, and lubricants be tried first for urogenital at-
rophy, and vaginal estrogens be reserved for patients who are
nonresponsive and only after consultation with the medical
oncologist.30,31
Limitations
This study has several limitations, including relatively small
size and the high percentage of patients with elevated base-
line E2 levels before any intervention. Additionally, the con-
clusion that these interventions are safe based on lack of sus-
tained E2 elevation may be considered arbitrary because there
was no nonhormonal intervention for comparison and the
study did not have statistical power or a long-term follow-up
to explore whether there was a higher rate of recurrences in
our study population vs historical controls.
Conclusions
This study provides further evidence that both an estradiol-
releasing vaginal ring and IVT are effective in treating urogeni-
tal symptoms in patients with BC taking AIs. A small number of
patientswithsustainedE2elevationsandhightestosteronelev-
elsobservedintheIVTarmsuggestthatlower-dosetestosterone
may be warranted. Elevated baseline E2 in patients who met all
eligibility criteria was a surprising finding. Prospective data in
