Abstract 
Purpose: To provide evidence‑based guidelines for early enteral nutrition (EEN) during critical illness.
Methods: We aimed to compare EEN vs. early parenteral nutrition (PN) and vs. delayed EN. We defined “early” EN as 
EN started within 48 h independent of type or amount. We listed, a priori, conditions in which EN is often delayed, and 
performed systematic reviews in 24 such subtopics. If sufficient evidence was available, we performed meta‑analyses; 
if not, we qualitatively summarized the evidence and based our recommendations on expert opinion. We used the 
GRADE approach for guideline development. The final recommendations were compiled via Delphi rounds.
Results: We formulated 17 recommendations favouring initiation of EEN and seven recommendations favouring 
delaying EN. We performed five meta‑analyses: in unselected critically ill patients, and specifically in traumatic brain 
injury, severe acute pancreatitis, gastrointestinal (GI) surgery and abdominal trauma. EEN reduced infectious compli‑
cations in unselected critically ill patients, in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, and after GI surgery. We did not 
detect any evidence of superiority for early PN or delayed EN over EEN. All recommendations are weak because of the 
low quality of evidence, with several based only on expert opinion.
Conclusions: We suggest using EEN in the majority of critically ill under certain precautions. In the absence of 
evidence, we suggest delaying EN in critically ill patients with uncontrolled shock, uncontrolled hypoxaemia and aci‑
dosis, uncontrolled upper GI bleeding, gastric aspirate >500 ml/6 h, bowel ischaemia, bowel obstruction, abdominal 
compartment syndrome, and high‑output fistula without distal feeding access.

Introduction
Existing guidelines recommend initiating enteral nutri-
tion (EN) within the first 24–48 h after intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission if patients are unable to eat, not 
clearly defining reasons to delay EN [1–3]. The present 
guideline is issued by the Working Group on Gastroin-
testinal Function within the Metabolism, Endocrinology 
and Nutrition (MEN) Section of the European Society

Take-home message: The administration of early EN appears to reduce 
infections and should be used for the majority of critically ill patients. 
However, there are certain situations when we recommend EN be 
delayed.

of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) and is endorsed by 
ESICM. Our objective was to provide evidence-based 
guidelines for early enteral nutrition (EEN) in critically 
ill patients, focusing on specific clinical conditions fre-
quently associated with delayed EN. Caloric and protein 
requirements, time to reach targets, type and route of 
EN, and timing of supplemental or full parenteral nutri-
tion (PN) were not addressed. A full version of the intro-
duction with references is available in Supplement 1.
Methods
A full version of methods with references is available in 
Supplement 1.
We performed a systematic review of “early” EN (EEN) 
vs. early parenteral nutrition (PN) and EEN vs. delayed 
EN in adult critically ill patients. After critical appraisal 
of identified studies and in accordance with current 
guidelines [1–3], we defined EEN as EN started within 
48 h of admission independent of the type or amount.
Thereafter, we predefined conditions in which EN is 
frequently delayed and performed a systematic review for 
each of these questions.
If randomised controlled trials (RCT) were available, 
we gave an evidence-based recommendation; if not, our 
recommendations were based on expert opinion (very 
low quality evidence), as all observational studies evalu-
ating EEN are intrinsically biased, because patients who 
are less severely ill are more likely to receive and tolerate 
EEN.
General considerations
We focussed on specific conditions in which EN is fre-
quently delayed and tolerance of EN might be impaired. 
Therefore, all our recommendations are based on general 
principles and precaution measures outlined in Table 1 
[4–9]. All study questions and recommendations refer to 
adult critically ill patients.
Results
All recommendations with the final agreed results are 
presented in Table 2.
A flow chart with evidence identification process (Sup-
plement 2), number of identified abstracts and assessed 
full texts for each study question (Supplement 3), Pub-
med search formulas (Supplement 4), evidence tables for 
each question with respective references (Supplement 5), 
evidence profiles for questions with meta-analyses 
(Table 3), evidence profiles for additional meta-analyses 
for Question 1 and 11 (Supplement 6), Forest plots for 
meta-analyses (Figs. 1, 2 and Supplement 7) are provided.  
Question 1: Should we use EEN in critically ill adult 
patients?
The methodology is described in Supplement 1.
Table 1 General principles and precautions for using EEN in critically ill patients at risk of intolerance
Starting and continuing EEN
Start EN at a slow rate (10–20 ml/h) while carefully monitoring abdominal/
gastrointestinal symptoms
Increase EN slowly once previous symptoms are resolving and no new 
symptoms occur
Do not increase EN in cases of intolerance or new symptoms, such as pain, 
abdominal distension or increasing intra‑abdominal pressure. In these 
circumstances EN should be either continued at a slow rate or ceased 
depending on the severity of symptoms and suspected underlying 
sinister pathology (e.g. mesenteric ischaemia)
Energy target during EEN
Do not aim to cover full energy target with EEN. The optimal energy and 
protein target in the early phase of acute critical illness is not known. EEN 
that exceeds actual energy expenditure appears harmful and should be 
avoided [4, 5], whereas hypocaloric EEN may be safe [6–8]
Monitoring and protocolised management of GI dysfunction during EEN
In case of gastric retention without other new abdominal symptoms use 
prokinetics and/or postpyloric feeding in a protocolised way [9]
During introduction and increasing the rate of EN, measurement of intra‑
abdominal pressure (IAP) provides an additional numeric value to detect 
negative dynamics of IAP during EN in patients with severe abdominal 
pathology, hypoperfusion or fluid overload
Individualized approach
For patients with diminished consciousness and inadequate swallowing, 
precautions to prevent aspiration of gastric contents may be useful, 
including considering postpyloric feeding
Premorbid health and course of the acute illness may differ between 
patients with similar diagnose; therefore an individual approach should 
always be applied

Comments
1. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients rather than early PN (conditional 
recommendation based on low quality evidence = Grade 2C) or delaying EN (condi‑
tional recommendation based on low quality evidence = Grade 2C)
100
2. We suggest delaying EN if shock is uncontrolled and haemodynamic and tissue 
perfusion goals are not reached, but start low dose EN as soon as shock is controlled 
with fluids and vasopressors/inotropes (conditional recommendation based on expert 
opinion = Grade 2D)
91.4
Concern regards applying EN when very high doses of vasopressors (e.g. noradrenalin 
>1 μg/kg/min) are required and hyperlactatemia is persisting or other signs of end organ 
hypoperfusion are present
3. We suggest delaying EN in case of uncontrolled life‑threatening hypoxaemia, hyper‑
capnia or acidosis, but using EEN in patients with stable hypoxaemia, and compen‑
sated or permissive hypercapnia and acidosis (conditional recommendation based on 
expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
4. We suggest that EN should not be delayed solely because of the concomitant use 
of neuromuscular blocking agents (conditional recommendation based on expert 
opinion = Grade 2D)
91.4
Concern regards very seldom patients in whom continuous infusion of neuromuscular 
blocking agents is needed, because these patients are in a very critical situation
5. We suggest starting low dose EEN in patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia and 
increase the dose after rewarming (conditional recommendation based on expert 
opinion = Grade 2D)
100
6. We suggest using EEN in adult patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygena‑
tion (conditional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
7. We suggest that EN should not be delayed solely because of prone positioning (condi‑
tional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D).
91.4
Concern regards tolerance of EN
8. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients with traumatic brain injury (condi‑
tional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
95.7
No agreement regards strength of recommendation
9. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients with stroke (ischaemic or haemor‑
rhagic) (conditional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
10. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients with spinal cord injury (conditional 
recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
11. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients with severe acute pancreatitis 
(conditional recommendation based on low quality evidence = Grade 2C)
100
12. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients after gastrointestinal surgery (con‑
ditional recommendation based on low quality evidence = Grade 2C)
100
13. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients after abdominal aortic surgery 
(conditional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
14. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients with abdominal trauma after the 
continuity of the GI tract is confirmed/restored (conditional recommendation based 
on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
Adequate gut perfusion needs to be confirmed
15. We suggest delaying EN in critically ill adult patients with overt bowel ischaemia 
(conditional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)

16. We suggest delaying EN in critically ill adult patients with high‑output intestinal 
fistula if reliable feeding access distal to the fistula is not achievable (conditional rec‑
ommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
17. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients with an open abdomen (condi‑
tional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
18a. We suggest using EEN in patients with intra‑abdominal hypertension without 
abdominal compartment syndrome, but consider temporary reduction or discontinua‑
tion of EN when intra‑abdominal pressure values further increase under EN (condi‑
tional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
87.1
Concern regards impaired gut perfusion and tolerance of EN. Monitoring trend of IAH and 
tolerance of EN are essential
18b. We suggest delaying EN in critically ill adult patients with abdominal compartment 
syndrome (conditional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
19. We suggest delaying EN in patients with active upper GI bleeding, and starting EN 
when the bleeding has stopped and no signs of rebleeding are observed (conditional 
recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
20. We suggest starting low dose enteral nutrition when acute, immediately life‑threat‑
ening metabolic derangements are controlled with or without liver support strategies, 
independent on grade of encephalopathy (conditional recommendation based on 
expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
21. We suggest delaying EN in critically ill adult patients if gastric aspirate volume is 
above 500 ml/6 h (conditional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D
91.4
Single large gastric aspirate volume should trigger administration of prokinetics and reas‑
sessment, but not prolonged withholding of EN
22. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients regardless of the presence of 
bowel sounds unless bowel ischaemia or obstruction is suspected (conditional recom‑
mendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)
100
23. We suggest using EEN in critically ill adult patients presenting with diarrhoea (condi‑
tional recommendation based on expert opinion = Grade 2D)

Question 1A: Should we use EEN rather than early 
PN?
Eight trials fulfilled the criteria and were included in 
meta-analyses (Supplement 5, Table 1A). Results are pre-
sented in Fig. 1.
For mortality, we included seven RCTs (2686 patients). 
EEN did not reduce mortality compared to early PN (RR 
0.95; 95% CI 0.76–1.19; P = 0.64; I2 = 9%). The certainty 
of evidence was moderate. We rated down for impreci-
sion (Table 3).
For infection, we included seven RCTs (2729 patients). 
EEN reduced the risk of infections compared to early PN 
(RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.35–0.86; P = 0.009; I2 = 65%). The 
certainty of evidence was low. We rated down for risk of 
bias and inconsistency (Table 3).
Adding 11 additional studies identified during searches 
for questions in specified patient groups did not signifi-
cantly change our results (included studies are presented 
in Supplement 5, Table 1C; evidence profiles in Supple-
ment 6 and Forest plots in Supplement 7, Fig. 3).

Comments: 
1. 
Although the randomization method was inappropriate or unclear in four RCTs out of �ive, we did not downgrade for risk of bias because the overall results did not change after 
excluding high risk of bias trials from the analysis, it is unlikely that risk of bias affected the mortality estimate. 
2. 
We did not downgrade for inconsistency (I2 = 9%)

Question 1B: Should we use EEN rather than delay

Fourteen studies fulfilled the criteria and were included in 
the meta-analysis (Supplement 5, Table 1B). Results of the 
meta-analyses on EEN vs. delayed nutritional intake (includ-
ing delayed EN, oral diet or PN) are presented in Fig. 2.
For mortality, we included 12 RCTs (662 patients). EEN 
did not reduce mortality compared to delayed nutritional 
intake (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.52–1.11; P = 0.149; I2 = 0%).
For infection, we included 11 RCTs (597 patients). EEN 
reduced risk of infection compared to delayed EN (RR 
0.64; 95% CI 0.46–0.90; P = 0.010; I2 = 25%).

The certainty of evidence was low. We rated down for 
risk of bias and imprecision (Table 3).
In one study it was not possible to determine whether 
early PN was also used in some patients in the EEN 
group [10]. Adding eight additional studies identified 
via specific searches did not significantly change the 
results (included studies are presented in Supplement 5, 
Table 1D; evidence profiles in Supplement 6 and Forest 
plots in Supplement 7, Fig. 4).
Recommendation 1. We suggest using EEN in critically ill 
adult patients rather than early PN (Grade 2C) or delaying 
EN (Grade 2C).
Question 2: Should we delay EN in patients with shock 
receiving vasopressors or inotropes?
No RCTs were retrieved. We identified and analysed four 
prospective cohort studies, four case series/retrospective 
cohort studies and two reviews (Supplement 5, Table 2).

There is concern that EN in shock further jeopard-
izes the already impaired splanchnic perfusion. Non-
occlusive bowel necrosis or non-occlusive mesenteric 
ischaemia (NOMI) has been reported in fewer than 1% 
of patients [11, 12], without evidence for causal rela-
tionship between shock, vasopressors, EN and NOMI 
[11–14]. In a large observational study, EEN (<48 h) in 
patients with ‘stable’ haemodynamics after fluid resus-
citation, whilst receiving at least one vasopressor, was 
associated with reduced mortality compared to late EN 
(>48 h) [15]. These results suggest that the use of con-
comitant vasopressors (especially with stable or decreas-
ing doses) should not preclude a trial of EN, despite 
a high prevalence of feeding intolerance [16]. In very 
unstable patients, EN may not have priority and poten-
tial positive effects of EN are unlikely to help improve 
instability. Persisting lactic acidosis may help identify 
uncontrolled shock.

Recommendation 2. We suggest delaying EN if shock is 
uncontrolled and haemodynamic and tissue perfusion 
goals are not reached, but start low dose EN as soon 
as shock is controlled with fluids and vasopressors/
inotropes (Grade 2D).
Question 3:
Should we delay EN in patients with:
A. Hypoxaemia;
B. Hypercapnia;
C. Acidosis?
We found no direct evidence on these subquestions in 
the literature, and RCTs in this population are unlikely to 
become available.
The rationale to withhold EN in patients with hypox-
aemia, hypercapnia and acidosis is to limit oxygen con-
sumption and CO2 production. However, the process of 
starving mobilises endogenous stores and is energy-con-
suming [17]. Acidosis may represent persistent shock and 
possibly contribute to gut dysfunction. Identifying and 
treating the cause of shock has priority over the initiation 
of EN. Similarly, in uncontrolled life-threatening hypox-
aemia and hypercapnia, EN should be delayed until the 
symptoms are resolving.

 389
In patients with acute lung injury, an RCT comparing 
trophic to full EN for up to 6 days was associated with less 
gastrointestinal intolerance when compared to full EN, 
without affecting ventilator-free days, infectious complica-
tions, physical function, or survival [7, 18]. There are no data 
suggesting EN in patients with chronic, subacute, compen-
sated or permissive hypercapnia is unsafe or not feasible.
Recommendation 3. We suggest delaying EN in case 
of uncontrolled life‑threatening hypoxaemia, hypercapnia 
or acidosis, but using EEN in patients with stable 
hypoxaemia, and compensated or permissive hypercapnia 
and acidosis (Grade 2D).
Question 4: Should we delay EN in patients receiving 
neuromuscular blocking agents?
One prospective study was identified (Supplement 5, 
Table 4), reporting similar gastric emptying as measured 
by gastric residual volume (GRV) in sedated patients 
with or without concomitant use of neuromuscular 
blocking agents [19]. The critical condition necessitating 
the use of neuromuscular blocking agents always needs 
to be considered, but these agents per se should not pre-
clude EN. Analgosedation is known to slow gastric emp-
tying [20]. Increased rate of EN intolerance is expected in 
deeply sedated patients with/without concomitant use of 
neuromuscular blocking agents.
Recommendation 4. We suggest that EN should not 
be delayed solely because of the concomitant use 
of neuromuscular blocking agents (Grade 2D).
Question 5: Should we delay EN in patients receiving 
therapeutic hypothermia?
One case series study addressing EN during thera-
peutic hypothermia was identified [21] (Supplement 5, 
Table 5).
During therapeutic hypothermia, energy metabo-
lism might be markedly reduced [22, 23] when shiver-
ing is prevented. The rationale to withhold EN during 
therapeutic hypothermia is based on the presumed 
decrease in gut motility due to hypothermia [24, 25] 
and required analgosedation [20]. It has been sug-
gested that EN could be successfully administered to 
Fig. 1 Forest plots (a mortality; b infections) Question 1A: early EN (EEN) vs. early PN (EPN) in unselected critically ill patients
 390
these patients [21]. Tolerance to enteral feeding was 
impaired during hypothermia, but improved during 
rewarming [21].
Recommendation 5. We suggest starting low dose 
EEN in patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia 
and increase the dose after rewarming (Grade 2D).
Question 6: Should we delay EN in patients receiving 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)?
No RCTs and no prospective cohort studies were iden-
tified. Four case series in adult patients with ECMO were 
assessed (Supplement 5, Table 6), suggesting that EN is 
feasible during ECMO.
Recommendation 6. We suggest using EEN in patients 
receiving ECMO (Grade 2D).
Question 7: Should we delay EN during prone 
position?
One prospective cross-over, one cohort and three case 
series studies were identified (Supplement 5, Table 7).
Data on tolerance of EN in prone position are con-
troversial. Observational studies found similar GRVs in 
prone and supine position [26], whereas poor feeding tol-
erance was improved with semi-recumbent position dur-
ing supine periods and prokinetics [27, 28]. Although no 
RCTs on EN tolerance during prone position are avail-
able, reported studies do not support withholding EN in 
a Mortality

prone position. Gastric emptying seems not to be signifi-
cantly influenced by prone position and adverse events in 
most studies not increased.
Recommendation 7. We suggest that EN should not be 
delayed solely because of prone positioning (Grade 2D).
Remark: We suggest considering early use of prokinet-
ics followed by post-pyloric feeding in case of persisting 
gastric retention.
Question 8: Should we delay EN in patients with trau-
matic brain injury?
We identified a Cochrane review with two updates and 
one recent meta-analysis, comparing early vs. late feed-
ing, independent on the route of nutrition (EN or PN) 
(Supplement 5, Table 8C). We identified three RCTs 
comparing EEN vs. early PN, three RCTs comparing EEN 
vs. delayed EN (one with restricted randomisation), and 
one RCT comparing early PN vs. delayed EN (Supple-
ment 5, Table 8A).
Question 8A: EEN vs. early PN
Three RCTs (116 patients) were included. EEN com-
pared to early PN in patients with traumatic brain injury 
did not affect mortality (RR 1.91; 95% CI 0.59–6.18; 
P = 0.279; I2 = 0%) or the risk of pneumonia (RR 1.23; 
95% CI 0.79–1.90; P = 0.36; I2 = 0%). The certainty of 
evidence for mortality outcome was low, for pneumo-
nia it was very low. We rated down for risk of bias and 
imprecision (Table 3). Supplement 7, Fig. 5.
Question 8B: EEN vs. delayed EN
For mortality, two RCTs (86 patients) were included. 
EEN did not affect mortality compared to delayed EN 
(RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.18–2.45; P = 0.53; I2 = 0%). The cer-
tainty of evidence was low. We rated down for impreci-
sion (Table 3).
For pneumonia, three RCTs (118 patients) were 
included. EEN did not affect the risk of pneumonia 
compared to delayed EN (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.55–1.35; 
P = 0.51; I2 = 0%). The certainty of evidence was very 
low. We rated down for risk of bias and imprecision 
(Table 3). Supplement 7, Fig. 6.
In addition to RCTs, five cohort studies addressing this 
question were identified (Supplement 5, Table 8B).
Existing evidence did not allow determining or exclud-
ing any benefit or harm of EEN, therefore our recom-
mendation is based on expert opinion.
Recommendation 8. We suggest using EEN in patients 
with traumatic brain injury (Grade 2D).
Question 9: Should we delay EN in patients with 
stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic)?
We identified two RCTs in patients with ischaemic 
stroke and one retrospective study in patients with 
hypertensive intracerebral haemorrhage (Supplement 5, 
Tables 9A, B).
One small RCT compared early vs. delayed EN and 
reported amelioration of cell-mediated immunity [29]; 
however, both groups received PN to meet caloric targets 
from day 1. A large RCT compared EEN (“as soon as pos-
sible”) to no nutrition within 7 days and reported a trend 
towards reduction of long-term mortality (6 months) 
with EN, with an increased risk of poor neurologic out-
come in survivors [30]. An observational study reported 
reduction in infectious complications with EEN vs. 
delayed EN [31].
Recommendation 9. We suggest using EEN in patients 
with stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) (Grade 2D).
Question 10: Should we delay EN in patients with spi-
nal cord injury?
One RCT addressed EEN (<72 h) vs. delayed EN in 
cervical spinal injury [32]. No differences in outcome 
variables were identified. One retrospective cohort study 
addressed safety of EN early after spinal cord injury and 
reported no major complications [33] (Supplement 5, 
Tables 10A, B).
Recommendation 10. We suggest using EEN in patients 
with spinal cord injury (Grade 2D).
Question 11: Should we delay EN in patients with 
severe acute pancreatitis (SAP)?
We identified five systematic reviews with meta-anal-
yses comparing EN to PN while not considering timing 
(Supplement 5, Table 11B). All meta-analyses concluded 
that EN was beneficial in reducing infections and three 
reported reduced mortality [3, 34, 35].
We identified five RCTs addressing EEN (“early” as 
defined by the authors) vs. early PN in SAP whereas 
only two studies defined “early” as <48 h. Three further 
RCTs addressed EEN vs. early PN and one RCT EEN vs. 
delayed EN in “predicted SAP”
. Two RCTs addressing 
acute pancreatitis independent of severity and one RCT 
 392
studying mixed patients undergoing abdominal surgery 
were not included. Supplement 5, Table 11A.
We performed three separate meta-analyses all com-
paring EEN vs. early PN: (A) SAP and “early” as defined 
by the authors of the original study; (B) predicted SAP 
and “early” as defined by the authors of the original study; 
(C) predicted SAP and early defined as <48 h.
Question 11A: SAP (as stated by the authors). Early 
(“early” as defined by the authors) EN vs. PN
For mortality we included five RCTs (283 patients). 
EEN did not reduce the risk of death compared to PN 
(RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.23–1.38; P = 0.21; I2 = 35.1%). The 
certainty of evidence was low. We rated down for impre-
cision (Table 3).
For any infections we included five RCTs (283 patients). 
EEN reduced the risk of infections compared to PN (RR 
0.48; 95% CI 0.23–0.98; P = 0.045; I2 = 76%). The cer-
tainty of evidence was low. We rated down for inconsist-
ency and imprecision (Table 3).
For pancreatic infections we included four RCTs (233 
patients). EEN reduced the risk of pancreatic infections 
compared to PN (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.21–0.52; P < 0.0001; 
I2 = 0%) The certainty of evidence was low. We rated 
down for risk of bias and imprecision (Table 3). Supple-
ment 7, Fig. 7.
Question 11B: Predicted SAP. Early (“early” as defined 
by the authors) EN vs. PN
For mortality we included eight RCTs (417 patients). 
EEN did not reduce the risk of death compared to PN 
(RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.22–1.13; P = 0.09; I2 = 38%). The cer-
tainty of evidence was low. We rated down for impreci-
sion (Supplement 6).
For any infections we included eight RCTs (417 
patients). EEN reduced the risk of infections compared to 
PN (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.30–0.91; P = 0.023; I2 = 63.5%). 
The certainty of evidence was low. We rated down for 
risk of bias and inconsistency (Supplement 6).
For pancreatic infections we included five RCTs (202 
patients). The use of EEN reduced the risk of pancreatic 
infections compared to PN (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.24–0.52; 
P < 0.0001; I2 = 0%). The certainty of evidence was low. 
We rated down for risk of bias and imprecision (Supple-
ment 6). Supplement 7, Fig. 8.
Question 11C: Predicted SAP. Early (<48 h) EN vs. PN
For mortality we included five RCTs (232 patients). 
EEN (<48 h) did not reduce the risk of death compared to 
PN (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.15–2.55; P = 0.50; I2 = 41%). The 
certainty of evidence was low. We rated down for impre-
cision (Supplement 6).
For any infections we included five RCT (232 patients), 
EEN (<48 h) reduced the risk of infections compared to 
PN (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.28–0.83; P = 0.008, I2 = 9%). The 
certainty of evidence was low. We rated down for risk of 
bias, inconsistency and imprecision (Supplement 6).
For pancreatic infections we included three RCTs (167 
patients). EEN (<48 h) reduced the risk of pancreatic 
infections compared to PN (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.22–0.73; 
P = 0.003; I2 = 0%). The certainty of evidence was low. 
We rated down for risk of bias and imprecision (Supple-
ment 6). Supplement 7, Fig. 9.
Taken together, the studies in different subpopulations 
have demonstrated a reduction of infections but no con-
vincing effect of EEN on mortality.
Recommendation 11. We suggest using EEN in patients 
with severe acute pancreatitis (Grade 2C).
Question 12: Should we delay EN in patients after GI 
surgery?
Out of three published meta-analyses [36–38] address-
ing early postoperative feeding including early oral diet, 
the two more recent papers [36, 37] reached different 
conclusions: reduced mortality and length of stay (LOS) 
but increased risk of vomiting analysing 15 RCTs [37] vs. 
no difference in mortality and LOS, but reduced compli-
cations in early group from 13 RCTs [36].
We identified three RCTs comparing early vs. delayed 
EN after emergency GI surgery and six RCTs in elective GI 
surgery. Two RCTs compared EEN vs. early PN in patients 
after elective GI surgery (Supplement 5, Table 12).
Question 12A: Emergency GI surgery. EEN vs delayed EN
Three RCTs (343 patients) were included. EEN did not 
affect mortality compared to delayed EN (RR 0.80; 95% 
CI 0.46–1.40; P = 0.44; I2 = 0%). EEN reduced the risk 
of infections compared to delayed EN (RR 0.61; 95% CI 
0.40–0.93; P = 0.02; I2 = 0%). The certainty of evidence 
was low. We rated down for risk of bias and imprecision 
(Table 3). Supplement 7, Fig. 10.
Question 12B: Elective GI surgery. EEN vs. delayed EN
For mortality three RCTs (346 patients) were included. 
EEN did not affect mortality compared to delayed EN in 
patients after elective GI surgery (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.25–
2.81; P = 0.77; I2 = 17%). The certainty of evidence was 
low. We rated down for imprecision (Table 3).
For any infections six RCTs (432 patients) were 
included. EEN reduced the risk of infections compared 
to delayed EN (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23–0.82; P = 0.01; 
I2 = 46%). The certainty of evidence was low. We rated 
down for risk of bias and imprecision (Table 3).
 393
Five RCTs (404 patients) reported anastomotic 
leak. EEN reduced the risk of surgical leak compared 
to delayed EN (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.20–0.93; P = 0.03; 
I2 = 0%). The certainty of evidence was low. We rated 
down for imprecision (Table 3). Supplement 7, Fig. 11.
Question 12C: Elective GI surgery. EEN vs early PN
Two RCTs (440 patients) were included. EEN did not 
reduce the risk of pneumonia compared to early PN (RR 
0.59; 95% CI 0.31–1.14; P = 0.12, I2 = 0%), but reduced the 
risk of anastomotic leak compared to early PN (RR 0.42; 
95% CI 0.19–0.95; P = 0.04; I2 = 63%). The certainty of evi-
dence was low. We rated down for risk of bias, inconsist-
ency and imprecision (Table 3). Supplement 7, Fig. 12.
Recommendation 12. We suggest using EEN in patients 
after GI surgery (Grade 2C).
Question 13: Should we delay EN in patients after 
abdominal aortic surgery?
No RCTs but two cohort studies were identified (Sup-
plement 5, Table 13). Cohort studies both in elective [39] 
and emergency repair [40] did not compare EEN with 
any of our comparators, but showed that EEN was suc-
cessful in a minority of patients. A multimodal approach 
has been proposed [41], including early removal of 
nasogastric tubes, immediate postoperative mobilisation 
early oral or enteral feeding, accepting GRV up to 500 ml 
and use of prokinetics. Although these patients are at risk 
of bowel ischaemia with prevalence reported between 7 
and 17% [42, 43], the risk itself should not lead to with-
holding EN, unless bowel ischaemia is suspected (see also 
Recommendation 15).
Recommendation 13. We suggest using EEN in patients 
after abdominal aortic surgery (Grade 2D).
Question 14: Should we delay EN in patients with 
abdominal trauma?
Ten RCTs and ten cohort studies addressing EEN in 
trauma patients (RCTs: within 6–48 h; cohort studies: 
within 12–96 h) were identified, but abdominal trauma 
specifically was addressed in six RCTs, four of them com-
pared EEN to early PN and two EEN to delayed EN (Sup-
plement 5, Table 14A).
Question 14A: EEN vs early PN
For mortality two RCTs (142 patients) were included. 
EEN did not affect mortality compared to early PN (RR 
0.49; 95% CI 0.09–2.69; P = 0.41; I2 = 0%). The certainty 
of evidence was very low. We rated down for risk of bias 
and imprecision (Table 3).
For any infection four RCTs (219 patients) were 
included. EEN did not affect the risk of infections com-
pared to early PN (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.24–1.42; P = 0.24; 
I2 = 59%). The certainty of evidence was very low. We 
rated down for risk of bias, inconsistency and impreci-
sion (Table 3). Supplement 7, Fig. 13.
Question 14B: EEN vs delayed EN
Two RCTs (101 patients) were included. EEN did not 
affect mortality compared to delayed EN (RR 0.74; 95% 
CI 0.18–3.11; P = 0.708). The certainty of evidence was 
very low. We rated down for risk of bias and imprecision 
(Table 3).
EEN did not affect the risk of infections compared to 
delayed EN (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.41–1.70; P = 0.837). The 
certainty of evidence was very low. We rated down for 
risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision (Table 3). See 
Supplement 7, Fig. 14.
Of note, earlier studies in this patient group almost 
exclusively used surgical jejunostomy for EN.
Existing evidence did not allow verifying or excluding 
any benefit or harm of EEN; therefore our recommen-
dation is based on expert opinion. In addition to RCTs, 
nine observational studies were identified (Supplement 5, 
Table 14B).
An earlier meta-analysis in adult trauma patients in 
ICU (not specifically abdominal trauma) showed survival 
benefit in EEN commenced within 24 h after trauma [44].
Recommendation 14. We suggest using EEN in patients 
with abdominal trauma when the continuity of the GI tract 
is confirmed/restored (Grade 2D).
Question 15: Should we delay EN in patients with 
bowel ischaemia?
We identified no clinical studies, but physiological 
knowledge and common sense support withholding 
EN in patients with overt bowel ischaemia. However, 
patients with endoscopic evidence of mild to moderate 
large bowel mucosal ischaemia, without signs of trans-
mural ischaemia or bowel distension, might profit from 
low dose EN. In this case we support considering EN. In a 
recent retrospective study, survivors were more often fed 
enterally before the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischae-
mia, but no independent association between EN and 
mortality was demonstrated [45].

Recommendation 15. We suggest delaying EN in patients 
with overt bowel ischaemia (Grade 2D).
Question 16: Should we delay EN in critically ill adult 
patients with intestinal fistula?
We identified one retrospective cohort study and two 
case series, all showing outcome benefit of “early” EN 
(Supplement 5, Table 16). However, “early” was defined 
as EN started within 7 days or 14 days of admission. Ret-
rospective design further diminishes the importance of 
these studies.
Intolerance of EN or increasing fistula output causing 
skin breakdown or fluid/electrolyte imbalance are evi-
dent reasons to decrease or discontinue EN [46].
Recommendation 16. We suggest delaying EN in patients 
with high‑output intestinal fistula if reliable feeding access 
distal to the fistula is not achievable (Grade 2D).
Question 17: Should we delay EN in patients with an 
open abdomen?
Seven observational studies (one prospective cohort 
study, three retrospective cohort studies and four case 
series) were identified; two studies compared EEN (dif-
ferent definitions) vs delayed EN and reported higher 
rate of early abdominal closure, less fistula formation and 
lower incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in 
the “early” EN group (Supplement 5, Table 17). The larg-
est study comparing EN to no EN in patients with open 
abdomen after abdominal trauma reported independent 
associations between EN and ultimate fascial closure and 
decreased mortality rate in patients without bowel injury, 
but no difference in a subgroup of patients with bowel 
injury [47].
Recommendation 17. We suggest using EEN in patients 
with open abdomen (Grade 2D).
Question 18: Should we delay EN in patients with 
intra-abdominal hypertension?
Four observational studies were identified (Supple-
ment 5, Table 18), only one addressed early vs. delayed 
EN [48]. All studies reported high incidence of feeding 
intolerance associated with intra-abdominal hyperten-
sion, but data are not conclusive regarding causality. A 
recently published study demonstrated that EEN did not 
increase intra-abdominal pressure, but values exceeding 
15 mmHg were associated with higher rates of feeding 
intolerance in patients with severe acute pancreatitis [48].
No prospective study addressing EN in patients with 
abdominal compartment syndrome [49] was identified. 
As abdominal compartment syndrome is an immediately 
life-threatening condition with jeopardized splanchnic 
perfusion, we suggest to withhold or stop EN and try to 
lower intra-abdominal pressure.
Recommendation 18a. We suggest using EEN in patients 
with intra‑abdominal hypertension without abdominal 
compartment syndrome, but consider temporary 
reduction or discontinuation of EN when intra‑abdominal 
pressure values further increase under EN (Grade 2D).
Recommendation 18b. We suggest delaying EN in patients 
with abdominal compartment syndrome (Grade 2D).
Question 19: Should we delay EN in patients with 
upper GI bleeding?
No studies addressing EEN were identified. One RCT 
in bleeding due to gastric or duodenal ulcer reported 
shorter hospital stay (4.2 ± 1.2 vs. 5.9 ± 1.4 days, 
P < 0.001) in the early oral feeding group [50].
EN as protection against stress ulceration and GI 
bleeding is suggested in one meta-analysis [51], one 
retrospective study in burns [52] and several reviews 
[53–55]. An RCT comparing ranitidine and sucralfate 
reported EN as an independently protective factor 
against GI bleeding [56]. The main rationale to pro-
hibit eating/EN is based on fear for disturbed visibility 
in a further endoscopy/intervention due to rebleeding. 
Therefore, delaying EN for 48–72 h in patients with a 
high risk of rebleeding has been suggested [57]. Con-
sidering the absence of evidence to support this time 
frame, we suggest starting EN during the first 24–48 h 
after bleeding has been stopped; prolonged postpone-
ment of EN is unnecessary or even harmful because of 
increased risk of stress ulceration. Importantly, there 
is no evidence that fine-bore nasogastric tubes cause 
variceal bleeding [57].
Recommendation 19. We suggest delaying EN in patients 
with active upper GI bleeding, and starting EN when the 
bleeding has stopped and no signs of rebleeding are 
observed (Grade 2D).
Question 20: Should we delay EN in patients with 
acute liver failure?
We could not identify any study in acute or acute-on-
chronic liver failure patients. Some benefits of EN have 
been shown in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, mal-
nourished patients with cirrhosis and patients with liver 
transplantation [58–60], where glycogen stores may be 
depleted after an overnight fast and metabolic conditions 
resemble prolonged starvation in healthy individuals 
[61]. EN in fulminant acute liver failure has never been 
studied. These patients often present with hypoglycae-
mia, which should be corrected with intravenous glucose, 
 395
sometimes together with insulin. Fulminant liver failure 
is associated with increased serum amino acid concen-
trations, especially glutamine [62, 63]. It seems likely 
that a failing liver is unable to provide effective metabolic 
support required for nutrition. The pathophysiological 
rationale to delay EN in fulminant hepatic failure would 
be to “spare” the severely injured liver from the duties 
of metabolising and storing nutrition during a period of 
stress and also to avoid additional increases in ammonia. 
Intravenous provision of nutrients except correction of 
hypoglycemia and appropriate provision of vitamins and 
trace elements may be futile or harmful early in the clini-
cal course [64].
Recommendation 20. We suggest starting low dose EN 
when acute, immediately life‑threatening metabolic 
derangements are controlled with or without liver support 
strategies, independent on grade of encephalopathy 
(Grade 2D).
Remark: Arterial ammonia levels should be monitored.
Question 21: Should we delay EN in patients with 
large gastric aspirate volumes (GAV)?
We identified no study addressing this question. Based 
on existing evidence from two RCTs comparing the 
threshold volumes to stop already started EN [65, 66], 
a clear threshold volume (in ranges up to 500 ml) that 
increased the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia 
was not identified. Measurements of GAV/GRV are not 
a gold standard and alternative methods (like ultrasound) 
can be applied to diagnose overfilling of the stomach. 
Gross distension of the stomach is likely to be undesir-
able and therefore we suggest that EN should be delayed 
when GAV/GRV is >500 ml/6 h [65], either for a lim-
ited time period or until administration of prokinetics. 
For patients with persistently large GAV/GRVs the use 
of postpyloric feeding should be considered rather than 
withholding EN, unless bowel ischaemia or obstruction is 
suspected (see also Recommendation 15).
Recommendation 21. We suggest delaying EN if gastric 
aspirate volume is above 500 ml/6 h (Grade 2D).
Question 22: Should we delay EN in patients with 
absent bowel sounds?
One cohort study was identified [67] (Supplement 5, 
Table 22). Bowel sounds are frequently absent in mechan-
ically ventilated patients and this is associated with 
impaired outcome [68]. The concept that bowel sounds 
must be present before initiation of enteral feeding is 
not based on evidence and should be abandoned [69]. 
After laparotomy small intestinal motility is frequently 
preserved despite gastric and colonic paresis. The small 
intestine may contract silently (absence of gas), while 
feeding is well tolerated [69]. Gastric and colonic paresis 
may effectively be treated with prokinetics [70]. Initiation 
of EN in absence of bowel sounds might be associated 
with earlier return of bowel sounds, fewer episodes of 
vomiting, and shorter ICU and hospital stay [67].
Recommendation 22. We suggest using EEN regardless 
of the presence of bowel sounds unless bowel ischaemia or 
obstruction is suspected (Grade 2D).
Question 23: Should we delay EN in patients with 
diarrhoea?
There were no studies testing delay of EN in case of 
diarrhoea, but diarrhoea is often considered as a reason 
to delay EN [71]. Prevalence of diarrhoea in unselected 
ICU population is between 14 and 21% [72, 73]. Causes 
include impaired digestion/absorption, bacterial over-
growth or infection such as Clostridium difficile. Obser-
vational studies [74, 75] suggest that diarrhoea can be 
effectively managed with protocolised measures other 
than immediate cessation in EN. We recommend analys-
ing the causes of diarrhoea and treat appropriately (e.g. 
C. difficile colitis). We also suggest considering treating 
bacterial overgrowth by selective decontamination, fibre-
enriched or semi-elementary diet or digestive enzymes to 
reduce diarrhoea.
Recommendation 23. We suggest using EEN in patients 
with diarrhoea (Grade 2D).
Conclusions
We suggest using EEN, initiated at a low rate, in the 
majority of critically ill patients; however, the evidence 
is weak. Beneficial effects in terms of infection preven-
tion have been demonstrated in unselected critically ill 
patients, as well as in patients with severe acute pancrea-
titis and after GI surgery. However, we suggest delaying 
EN in patients with uncontrolled shock (haemodynamic 
and tissue perfusion goals are not met despite of fluids 
and vasopressors), uncontrolled hypoxaemia and aci-
dosis, uncontrolled GI bleeding, overt bowel ischaemia 
(occlusive or non-occlusive), bowel obstruction (mechan-
ical ileus), abdominal compartment syndrome, gastric 
aspirate volume >500 ml/6 h or high-output fistula if reli-
able distal feeding access is not achievable.
