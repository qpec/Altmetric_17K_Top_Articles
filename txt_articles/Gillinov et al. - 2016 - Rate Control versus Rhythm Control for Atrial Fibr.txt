Abstract
BACKGROUND—Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery is associated with increased rates of 
death, complications, and hospitalizations. In patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation who are 
in stable condition, the best initial treatment strategy — heart-rate control or rhythm control — 
remains controversial.
METHODS—Patients with new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation were randomly assigned to 
undergo either rate control or rhythm control. The primary end point was the total number of days 
of hospitalization within 60 days after randomization, as assessed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
RESULTS—Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 695 of the 2109 patients (33.0%) who 
were enrolled preoperatively; of these patients, 523 underwent randomization. The total numbers 
of hospital days in the rate-control group and the rhythm-control group were similar (median, 5.1 
days and 5.0 days, respectively; P = 0.76). There were no significant between-group differences in 
the rates of death (P = 0.64) or overall serious adverse events (24.8 per 100 patient-months in the 
rate-control group and 26.4 per 100 patient-months in the rhythm-control group, P = 0.61), 
including thromboembolic and bleeding events. About 25% of the patients in each group deviated 
from the assigned therapy, mainly because of drug ineffectiveness (in the rate-control group) or 
amiodarone side effects or adverse drug reactions (in the rhythm-control group). At 60 days, 
93.8% of the patients in the rate-control group and 97.9% of those in the rhythm-control group had 
had a stable heart rhythm without atrial fibrillation for the previous 30 days (P = 0.02), and 84.2% 
and 86.9%, respectively, had been free from atrial fibrillation from discharge to 60 days (P = 0.41).
CONCLUSIONS—Strategies for rate control and rhythm control to treat postoperative atrial 
fibrillation were associated with equal numbers of days of hospitalization, similar complication 
rates, and similarly low rates of persistent atrial fibrillation 60 days after onset. Neither treatment 
strategy showed a net clinical advantage over the other. (Funded by the National Institutes of

In recent years, much research has focused on the prevention of atrial fibrillation after 
cardiac surgery, but highly effective interventions are lacking. Thus, postoperative atrial 
fibrillation remains the most common complication after cardiac surgery, with an incidence 
of 20 to 50%.1–4 This complication has major adverse consequences for patients and the 
health care system, including increased rates of death, complications, and hospitalizations 
and inflated costs.1–9 Therefore, efforts to determine the most effective preventive strategies 
and management practices are important. There are two general approaches to managing 
postoperative atrial fibrillation: heart-rate control (hereafter “rate control”) and rhythm 
control with the use of antiarrhythmic drugs, direct-current cardioversion, or both.
In the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial, 
in which investigators studied the use of rate control versus rhythm control in nonsurgical 
patients with atrial fibrillation, the use of rhythm control was shown to offer no survival 
advantage but was associated with more frequent hospitalizations and adverse drug effects.10 
However, some studies involving patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac 
surgery have suggested that rhythm control may offer advantages over rate control, although 
the evidence is inconclusive.3,11–13
The lack of consensus regarding best practices for the management of atrial fibrillation after 
cardiac surgery has led to major variations in practice patterns.1,3,14–16 Treatment 
approaches aim to reduce the severity of associated symptoms, limit adverse hemodynamic 
effects, decrease the length of hospital stay, prevent read-missions, and improve survival. 
Advocates of a rhythm-control strategy contend that a more rapid conversion to sinus rhythm 
might reduce thromboembolic risk, minimize exposure to anticoagulation, and restore 
functional capacity more quickly than rate control. Proponents of rate control counter that 
this approach averts the potential adverse effects of antiarrhythmic drugs and complications 
associated with cardioversion.
Determining the risks and benefits of rate control versus rhythm control for postoperative 
atrial fibrillation may provide information to improve clinical decision making and resource 
utilization for this highly prevalent condition. The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network 
(CTSN), therefore, conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 
rate control versus rhythm control for new-onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter after 
cardiac surgery.
METHODS
TRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
This trial was conducted at 23 sites in the United States and Canada; the institutional review 
board at each site approved the protocol. A coordinating center, independent adjudication 
committee, and data and safety monitoring board oversaw the progress of the trial. The 
investigators vouch for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol, which is available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org.

 PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS
The trial enrolled adult patients in hemodynamically stable condition who were undergoing 
elective cardiac surgery to treat coronary artery disease or heart-valve disease; none of the 
patients had a history of atrial fibrillation (see the eligibility criteria in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org). All the patients provided written informed consent.
The patients were enrolled in the study and underwent randomization if they had 
postoperative atrial fibrillation that persisted for more than 60 minutes or recurrent episodes 
of atrial fibrillation during the index hospitalization (≤7 days after surgery). Patients with a 
history of atrial fibrillation were excluded to avoid making changes to their established 
preoperative medication regimen for atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation.
Patients in the rate-control group received medications to slow the heart rate, with a goal of 
achieving a resting heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute. Patients in whom sinus 
rhythm did not return after an initial strategy of rate control could be switched to rhythm 
control if their provider thought that such treatment was necessary to improve their 
hemodynamic status or alleviate symptoms.
Patients in the rhythm-control group were treated with amiodarone with or without a rate-
slowing agent. If atrial fibrillation persisted for 24 to 48 hours after randomization, direct-
current cardioversion was recommended. The recommended dose of amiodarone was the 
equivalent of 3 g of oral amiodarone before hospital discharge, with a maintenance dose of 
200 mg per day or less if direct-current cardioversion was successful. It was recommended 
that the use of amiodarone be extended for 60 days, but discontinuation was allowed for 
amiodarone-related adverse events (e.g., symptomatic bradycardia, a corrected QT interval 
of >480 msec, or neuropathy).
If patients remained in atrial fibrillation or had recurrent atrial fibrillation 48 hours after 
randomization, anticoagulation with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2 to 3) 
was recommended, and bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin was allowed. 
Anticoagulation was recommended to be continued for 60 days, unless complications 
occurred.
To control for noncardiovascular reasons for hospitalization, we defined readiness for 
discharge from an atrial fibrillation perspective. For patients in the rate-control group with 
continuing atrial fibrillation, the readiness-for-discharge criteria included a target resting 
heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute. Patients in the rhythm-control group met the 
discharge criteria if they received a full amiodarone loading dose and were either free of 
atrial fibrillation for more than 24 hours and had no atrial fibrillation at the time of discharge 
or remained in atrial fibrillation after treatment with amiodarone for at least 48 hours or 
received direct-current cardioversion with adequate control of rate.
TRIAL END POINTS
The primary end point was the total number of days in the hospital (including emergency 
department visits) within 60 days after randomization. Secondary end points included the 
duration of the hospital stay from randomization to the time of eligibility for discharge on

 the basis of criteria regarding atrial fibrillation, the length of the index hospitalization, the 
need for readmission, heart rhythm and time to conversion to a sustained stable rhythm 
without atrial fibrillation, the need for permanent placement of a pacemaker, and the rates of 
death and adverse events. The status of patients with respect to atrial fibrillation was 
determined by means of telemetry during the first 7 days and by means of 
electrocardiography at the time of hospital discharge and at 30 days and 60 days. (Details 
about trial end points are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.) Follow-up assessments 
were performed 30 days and 60 days after randomization.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The primary null hypothesis of the trial was that there would be no between-group 
difference in the total number of days of hospitalization at 60 days after randomization. The 
sample size was based on estimates of the length of hospital stay and rate of 
rehospitalization,17 in addition to a blinded reestimation of sample size. Using a 
conservative estimate of a standard deviation of 6.3 days for the primary end point, we 
determined that enrollment of 520 patients assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two groups 
would give the study 90% power to detect a difference of 2.0 days between the groups. We 
tested the primary end point in an intention-to-treat analysis using a two-tailed Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test with an alpha level of 0.05. The test accommodated nonignorable missing 
outcomes because of death by assigning such patients the worst ranks on the basis of the 
date of death. We used Poisson regression to analyze rates of adverse events and Kaplan–
Meier analysis and the log-rank test to assess the time until conversion to a sustained, stable 
heart rhythm without atrial fibrillation. Sensitivity analyses to determine the influence of 
treatment nonadherence were performed with the use of an instrumental variable approach 
with the randomization assignment as the instrument.
RESULTS
PATIENTS
From May 2014 through May 2015, a total of 2109 patients met the eligibility criteria and 
were enrolled preoperatively (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among these 
patients, postoperative atrial fibrillation developed in 695 (33.0%); 523 of these patients 
underwent randomization. The characteristics of the two groups were similar at baseline 
(Table 1). The mean age was 68.8±9.1 years, and 24% of the patients were women. Isolated 
coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in approximately 40%, isolated 
valve surgery in 40%, and both procedures in 20%. The proportion of patients in whom 
postoperative atrial fibrillation developed was 28.1% among those who had undergone 
isolated CABG, 33.7% among those who had undergone isolated valve surgery, and 47.3% 
among those who had undergone combined procedures.
Approximately 24% of the patients in the rhythm-control group did not complete the full 
course of amiodarone and received beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or both (Table 
2). Among the patients in the rate-control group, 26.7% received amiodarone or direct-
current cardioversion. The majority of patients who discontinued or switched therapy did so 
for protocol-specified clinical reasons (80.0% in the rate-control group and 64.5% in the

 rhythm-control group). The timing of such changes in therapy differed between the groups, 
with more patients in the rate-control group than in the rhythm-control group changing 
therapy during the index hospitalization (83% vs. 48%). Overall, 60 patients (11.5%) 
received direct-current cardioversion (9.2% in the rate-control group and 13.8% in the 
rhythm-control group).
HOSPITALIZATION DAYS
The primary outcome, the number of hospital days from randomization until 60 days, did 
not differ significantly between the rate-control group and the rhythm-control group (mean, 
6.4 days and 7.0 days, respectively; median, 5.1 days and 5.0 days, respectively; P = 0.76) 
(Table 3). The mean length of stay for the index hospitalization after randomization was 5.5 
days in the rate-control group and 5.8 days in the rhythm-control group (median, 4.3 in each 
group; P = 0.88). A sensitivity analysis to determine the influence of treatment 
nonadherence confirmed the results of the intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.51 for the total 
hospital stay, P = 0.72 for the index hospital stay). (Details regarding the sensitivity analysis 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.) When the length of stay for the index 
hospitalization was adjusted for discharge readiness on the basis of status regarding atrial 
fibrillation, the mean length of stay was 5.0 days in the rate-control group and 5.2 in the 
rhythm-control group, with a median of 4.0 days in each group (P = 0.99).
During the study period, there were 159 hospital readmissions, including emergency 
department visits, with no significant between-group difference in the rate per 100 patient-
months (Table 3). Rates of readmission for cardiovascular causes were 6.8 per 100 patient-
months in the rate-control group and 8.1 per 100 patient-months in the rhythm-control group 
(P = 0.48); readmission rates for the treatment of atrial fibrillation were 2.6 and 3.9 per 100 
patient-months, respectively (P = 0.27). The proportion of patients who were readmitted 
within 30 days after hospital discharge was 22.8% in the rate-control group and 21.4% in the 
rhythm-control group (P = 0.71).
TIMING OF ONSET AND RESOLUTION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
The average time to the onset of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 2.4 days (range, 0 to 7) 
after surgery. A total of 46.2% of the patients in the rate-control group and 31.8% of those in 
the rhythm-control group met the protocol-specified indications for the initiation of 
anticoagulation. At the time of hospital discharge, warfarin had been prescribed for 42.7% of 
the patients in the rate-control group and for 43.3% of those in the rhythm-control group, 
with an average duration of anticoagulation of 44.8 days and 44.9 days, respectively.
A total of 89.9% of the patients in the rate-control group and 93.5% of those in the rhythm-
control group had a stable, sustained heart rhythm without atrial fibrillation at hospital 
discharge (P = 0.14). At 60 days, a stable heart rhythm without atrial fibrillation had been 
achieved for the previous 30 days in 93.8% of the patients in the rate-control group and in 
97.9% of those in the rhythm-control group (P = 0.02); from discharge to 60 days, the 
percentages were 84.2% in the rate-control group and 86.9% in the rhythm-control group (P 
= 0.41) (Fig. 1).

 DEATH AND ADVERSE EVENTS
At 60 days, five patients had died: three in the rate-control group and two in the rhythm-
control group (P = 0.64). There were no significant differences in the overall rates of serious 
adverse events between the rate-control group and the rhythm-control group (24.8 per 100 
patient-months and 26.4 per 100 patient-months, respectively; P = 0.61) (Table 4). The 
overall rates of cerebrovascular thromboembolism (0.8 per 100 patient-months in the rate-
control group and 0.4 per 100 patient-months in the rhythm-control group) and noncerebral 
thromboembolism (0.6 per 100 patient-months and 0.2 per 100 patient-months) were low 
and did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.40 for the cerebrovascular 
thromboembolism comparison and P = 0.31 for the noncerebral thromboembolism 
comparison). The rates of serious bleeding (a score of ≥3 on the Bleeding Academic 
Research Consortium scale, with scores ranging from 0 [no bleeding] to 5 [fatal bleeding]) 
were 2.2 per 100 patient-months in the rate-control group and 1.2 per 100 patient-months in 
the rhythm-control group (P = 0.21). The most common protocol-defined adverse events 
(either serious or nonserious) were major infections (9.3 per 100 patient-months in the rate-
control group and 6.6 per 100 patient-months in the rhythm-control group, P = 0.13), cardiac 
arrhythmias (4.7 and 6.2 per 100 patient-months, respectively; P = 0.30), and pleural 
effusions (3.0 and 4.8 per 100 patient-months, respectively; P = 0.16).
DISCUSSION
Our findings confirm that new-onset atrial fibrillation remains a common complication after 
cardiac surgery. More than 30% of the patients who underwent cardiac surgery in our trial 
had either sustained or recurrent postoperative atrial fibrillation. These rates approached 
50% among patients who underwent combined CABG and valve surgery. Postoperative 
atrial fibrillation is associated with several adverse consequences and independently predicts 
increased rates of death and complications, including stroke, heart failure, and 
infection.1,2,6,8 Moreover, postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery significantly 
increases the length of hospital stay, readmission risk, and resource utilization. Estimates of 
the average annual cost of treatment of postoperative atrial fibrillation and its sequelae 
approach $1 billion in the United States.1,18,19
Despite the importance of postoperative atrial fibrillation, the most effective management 
strategy for this common surgical complication remains uncertain, a factor that had led to a 
substantial variation in treatments. The joint guidelines of the American College of 
Cardiology, American Heart Association, and Heart Rhythm Society, which were published 
when our trial was far along in enrollment, recommend rate control with beta-blockers as the 
first-line therapy in patients whose condition is hemodynamically stable (i.e., class I, level of 
evidence A).20 These recommendations are based partly on studies regarding the prevention 
of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery and extrapolation from the AFFIRM trial, which 
compared rate control with rhythm control in nonsurgical patients with atrial fibrillation. 
The AFFIRM trial showed that management of nonsurgical atrial fibrillation with rhythm 
control offered no survival advantage over rate control and that patients who were treated 
with a rhythm-control strategy were more likely to require hospitalization and have adverse 
drug effects than were those who were treated with a rate-control strategy.10 By comparison,

 rigorous evidence in the cardiac surgical setting is sparse and limited to several 
retrospective, observational studies and one pilot randomized trial comparing rate control 
with rhythm control in 50 patients.5–9,11,13
In our trial, in which the number of patients enrolled was 10 times that in the previous 
studies, we discovered important insights into the benefits and risks of rate control versus 
rhythm control for the treatment of postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. We 
found no significant difference between treatment strategies with respect to the primary end 
point, the total number of hospital days, including the primary admission and any 
subsequent readmissions occurring within 60 days after randomization. Postoperative atrial 
fibrillation is usually a transient condition that resolves spontaneously but that may have 
hemodynamic consequences and result in treatment-related adverse events, such as bleeding, 
thromboembolic complications, drug-related toxic effects, and complications related to the 
use of direct-current cardioversion, events that may in turn lead to prolonged hospitalizations 
and repeat admissions. The primary end point that we used in this trial captures the short-
term effect of a very diverse set of adverse events. Moreover, further insight into the trade-
offs between rate control and rhythm control can help improve clinical decision making and 
resource utilization. The importance of this end point is reflected in the finding that the rate 
of hospital readmission at 30 days was more than 28%, with nearly one fifth of such 
readmissions resulting from recurrent atrial fibrillation.
Patients in the rhythm-control group achieved a stable heart rhythm without atrial fibrillation 
earlier than those in the rate-control group. In addition, the proportion of patients who were 
free of atrial fibrillation between day 30 and day 60 was significantly lower in the rhythm-
control group than in the rate-control group. However, the overall proportion of patients who 
were free of atrial fibrillation between hospital discharge and 60 days was much lower than 
the proportion who were free of atrial fibrillation between 30 days and 60 days, but the 
between-group difference was not significant. Although we did not compare strategies for 
anticoagulation in patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation, the results provide data that 
may inform clinical decision making. The protocol specified that anticoagulation therapy 
should be initiated in patients who had atrial fibrillation for more than 48 hours and those 
who had more than a single episode of atrial fibrillation during the index hospitalization. 
More patients in the rate-control group than in the rhythm-control group met this indication 
(46.2% vs. 31.8%). However, the proportions of patients who were prescribed warfarin at 
discharge were similar in the two groups, which may reflect additional considerations 
regarding the need for anticoagulation. The median duration of anticoagulation was 
approximately 45 days in each group.
With the anticoagulation strategy used in this trial, the incidence of serious thromboembolic 
events (2%) was low overall and did not differ significantly between the two groups. The 
overall percentage of patients with serious bleeding was approximately 3%, a frequency that 
did not differ significantly between the two groups. Nearly 90% of the bleeding events 
occurred in patients who were receiving anticoagulation. Thus, the relatively low incidence 
of thromboembolic events came at the expense of serious bleeding, which suggests the need 
to further study the trade-off between the risks and benefits of anticoagulation for atrial 
fibrillation after cardiac surgery.

 In this comparative effectiveness trial, we evaluated an initial strategy of rate control versus 
rhythm control in a clinical context in which changes in the status of patients can prompt 
alterations in the treatment regimen. Approximately 25% of the patients could not adhere to 
the assigned treatment strategy. Among the patients in the rate-control group, 26.7% 
received amiodarone or direct-current cardioversion, and 23.8% of the patients in the 
rhythm-control group did not complete the full course of amiodarone. The majority of 
treatment nonadherence occurred for prespecified clinical indications. Deviation from rate 
control was largely a result of drug ineffectiveness, whereas amiodarone was discontinued 
mostly due to drug-related toxic effects. In the AFFIRM trial, investigators noted crossover 
rates of 15 to 38% during the course of the trial in nonsurgical patients who were not as 
acutely ill as those in our trial.10
Our study has several limitations. First, the primary end point was a proxy for important 
clinical outcomes, such as stroke and serious bleeding. A randomized trial with the power to 
detect differences in these end points would have required the enrollment of thousands of 
patients. Second, the results of our trial pertain only to patients with new-onset postoperative 
atrial fibrillation. Third, there was a relatively high rate of treatment discontinuation, but in 
sensitivity analyses we confirmed the results of the intention-to-treat analysis. Fourth, we 
did not include quality-of-life measures because of the short duration of the trial and the 
likelihood that the effects of surgery would overshadow the effects of postoperative atrial 
fibrillation on quality of life. However, the inclusion of such measures might have provided 
insights into the burden of treatment and its trade-offs. Finally, we did not assess 
postoperative atrial fibrillation by means of continuous home monitoring, an approach that 
might have led to an underestimation of its prevalence.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation is common after cardiac surgery and amenable to either a 
rate-control or rhythm-control strategy. Approximately 85% of the patients in our trial had a 
stable heart rhythm without atrial fibrillation from the time of hospital discharge onward, 
and about 95% were free of atrial fibrillation by the end of the study. Anticipating this result, 
we chose an end point that was related to resource utilization and the experience of patients: 
days in the hospital after randomization. The study-group assignments did not influence this 
end point. However, we did observe clinical differences between the two approaches. An 
initial strategy of rate control averted much of the toxic effects and side effects associated 
with amiodarone but was associated with a slower resolution of atrial fibrillation, thereby 
leading to a greater need for anticoagulation (with its attendant risks) and a slightly higher 
prevalence of atrial fibrillation during follow-up. The faster resolution of atrial fibrillation in 
the rhythm-control group came at the price of amiodarone-related side effects in many 
patients, often necessitating discontinuation of amiodarone after hospital discharge. In 
patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation who are in hemodynamically stable condition, 
one strategy does not appear to have a net clinical advantage over the other. In such cases, 
the preferences of patients and physicians should dictate whether a rhythm-control approach 
that uses amiodarone with or without direct-current cardioversion is worth the benefit over a 
rate-control approach.

 Figure 1. Patients with No Atrial Fibrillation at 7 Days and Status at 30 Days and 60 Days
Panel A shows the proportion of patients undergoing cardiac surgery who had a stable heart 
rhythm without atrial fibrillation during the first week after randomization in the rate-control 
group and the rhythm-control group. Panel B shows the status with respect to atrial 
fibrillation at the time of discharge from the index hospitalization, at 30 days, and at 60 days, 
according to treatment group. The pink boxes denote patients in atrial fibrillation, and the 
blue boxes denote patients with a stable heart rhythm without atrial fibrillation. The patients’ 
status with respect to atrial fibrillation was determined by means of electrocardiography at 
the time of hospital discharge and at 30 days and 60 days. The accounting for atrial

 fibrillation included patients who had recurrent atrial fibrillation (as adjudicated by the 
clinical events committee) or who were readmitted to the hospital for recurrent atrial 
fibrillation during the interval periods. Overall, 11.5% of patients underwent direct-current 
cardioversion (9.2% in the rate-control group and 13.8% in the rhythm-control group). Of 
the direct-current cardioversions, 85% occurred during the index hospitalization. Among the 
patients who were discharged from the hospital with atrial fibrillation, direct-current 
cardioversion was performed during the index hospitalization in 3 of 26 patients (12%) in 
the rate-control group and in 7 of 17 patients (41%) in the rhythm-control group.
