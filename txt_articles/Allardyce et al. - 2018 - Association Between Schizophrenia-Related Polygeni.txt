IMPORTANCE Bipolar disorder (BD) overlaps schizophrenia in its clinical presentation and
genetic liability. Alternative approaches to patient stratification beyond current diagnostic
categories are needed to understand the underlying disease processes and mechanisms.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between common-variant liability for
schizophrenia, indexed by polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and psychotic presentations of BD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This case-control study in the United Kingdom used
multinomial logistic regression to estimate differential PRS associations across categories of
cases and controls. Participants included in the final analyses were 4436 cases of BD from the
Bipolar Disorder Research Network. These cases were compared with the genotypic data for
4976 cases of schizophrenia and 9012 controls from the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics
Consortium study and the Generation Scotland study. Data were collected between January
1, 2000, and December 31, 2013. Data analysis was conducted from March 1, 2016,
to February 28, 2017.
EXPOSURES Standardized PRSs, calculated using alleles with an association threshold of
P < .05 in the second Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study
of schizophrenia, were adjusted for the first 10 population principal components and
genotyping platforms.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Multinomial logit models estimated PRS associations with
BD stratified by Research Diagnostic Criteria subtypes of BD, by lifetime occurrence of
psychosis, and by lifetime mood-incongruent psychotic features. Ordinal logistic regression
examined PRS associations across levels of mood incongruence. Ratings were derived from
the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry interview and the Bipolar Affective
Disorder Dimension Scale.
RESULTS Of the 4436 cases of BD, 2966 (67%) were female patients, and the mean (SD) age
at interview was 46 [12] years. Across clinical phenotypes, there was an exposure-response
gradient, with the strongest PRS association for schizophrenia (risk ratio [RR] = 1.94; 95% CI,
1.86-2.01), followed by schizoaffective BD (RR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.22-1.54), bipolar I disorder
subtype (RR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.24-1.36), and bipolar II disorder subtype (RR = 1.04; 95% CI,
0.97-1.11). Within BD cases, there was an effect gradient, indexed by the nature of psychosis.
Prominent mood-incongruent psychotic features had the strongest association (RR = 1.46;
95% CI, 1.36-1.57), followed by mood-congruent psychosis (RR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.33) and
BD with no history of psychosis (RR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.15).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For the first time to date, a study shows a polygenic-risk
gradient across schizophrenia and BD, indexed by the occurrence and level of
mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms.

 A
lthough classified as a discrete diagnostic category,1-3
bipolardisorder(BD)overlapsconsiderablywithschizo-
phrenia (SCZ) in both its clinical presentation4-13 and
genetic liability.14-22 Bipolar disorder is a phenomenologi-
cally heterogeneous construct, and within the diagnostic
category, individuals with BD may have quite different symp-
tom profiles. It has been proposed that this clinical heteroge-
neity indicates underlying etiological heterogeneity and that
the degree of clinical similarity between BD and SCZ reflects
overlappingalleles,whichselectivelyinfluencespecific,shared
clinical characteristics rather than the global risk for the
disorder.23-25
Delusions and hallucinations are common in BD,26,27
with approximately one-third of all psychotic features
judged to be mood incongruent.28,29 Mood-incongruent
psychotic features are associated with poor prognosis and
poor lithium response and are qualitatively similar to the
prototypic symptoms of SCZ,30-32 suggesting that BD with
psychosis and particularly mood-incongruent psychotic fea-
tures may specify a subgroup or stratum with stronger etio-
logical links to SCZ. Stratified linkage and candidate-gene
studies of BD associations with chromosomal regions and
genes implicated in SCZ show stronger effects in psychosis
and mood-incongruent subsamples,33-36 providing some
support for this causal heterogeneity hypothesis; however,
lack of consistency in earlier linkage and candidate-gene
studies renders the overall support weak.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found a
substantial polygenic component to both BD and SCZ
risks, with a large proportion of the disorders’genetic vari-
ance explained by common alleles partially shared by the 2
disorders.20 This polygenic risk can be calculated for indi-
viduals with a single summary measure: the polygenic risk
score (PRS; with higher scores indicating a higher burden of
risk alleles), which allows us to examine the genetic basis of
symptom domains within and across the 2 disorders37-39
with greater power than do the historical linkage and
candidate-gene approaches. The PRS-SCZ differentiates BD
cases from controls,16,20 and there are differential PRS
associations across subtypes with schizoaffective bipolar
disorder (SABD) (an intermediate subtype characterized by
admixture of SCZ and BD symptoms) having a relatively
larger burden of SCZ risk, compared with other BD
subtypes.15,40 To date, lack of power in well-phenotyped
samples has hindered fine-scale examination of the
association of SCZ polygenic-risk with psychotic symp-
toms in BD.
This study aimed to examine the association between
polygenic liability for SCZ and psychotic presentations of
BD using the PRSs generated from the most powerful
SCZ-GWAS discovery set currently available.21 Measures rel-
evant to the occurrence and nature of psychotic symptoms
were considered. We hypothesized that BD with psychosis
would be associated with higher polygenic risk for SCZ and
that this association would be stronger when mood-
incongruent psychotic features were present, given their
phenotypic similarity to the psychotic symptoms of proto-
typic SCZ.

Key Points
Question What is the association between schizophrenia-related
polygenic liability and the occurrence and level of
mood-incongruence of psychotic symptoms in bipolar disorder?
Findings In this case-control study involving 4436 cases of
bipolar disorder, 4976 cases of schizophrenia, and 9012 controls,
there was an exposure-response gradient of polygenic risk.
Schizophrenia had the strongest association, followed by bipolar
disorder with prominent mood-incongruent psychotic features,
bipolar disorder with mood-congruent psychotic features, and
bipolar disorder with no psychosis; all differential associations
were statistically significant.
Meaning This study shows a gradient of genetic liability across
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, indexed by the occurrence of
psychosis and level of mood incongruence.

 GWAS.21Inprinciple,treatment-resistantSCZmaycarryhigher
polygenic risk burden; however, the PRSs in the CLOZUK
sample are similar to the PRSs in other SCZ samples used by
the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.21 The CLOZUK proce-
dures and methods were approved by the National Research
Ethics and were in line with the UK Human Tissue Act regu-
lations in partnership with the Leyden Delta.
Control Samples
The controls came from 2 UK sources: (1) the Type 1 Diabetes
GeneticsConsortiumstudy,whichcomprisedunscreenedcon-
trols (n = 2532) recruited through the 1958 Birth Cohort,48 and
(2) a subsample (n = 6480) of the Generation Scotland study
screened for psychiatric disorders.49 Controls were not asso-
ciated (pi-hat <0.2) with individuals in the Psychiatric Genom-
ics Consortium-SCZ discovery set and were matched ances-
trally to our case data sets.47 The Generation Scotland Access
Committee approved this application to use Generation Scot-
land as controls.
Genotyping, Quality Control, Phasing, and Imputation
Bipolar Cases
Genotypic data for the BD cases were processed in 3 batches,
each on a different platform. To mitigate against potential bias
from batch effects,50 stringent quality control (QC) was per-
formed on each platform separately prior to merging. Single-
nucleotidepolymorphisms(SNPs)wereexcludedifthecallrate
was less than 98%, the minor allele frequency (MAF) was less
than0.01,ortheSNPsdeviatedfromtheHardy-Weinbergequi-
librium(HWE)atP < 1 × 10−6.Individualswereexcludedifthey
had minimal or excessive autosomal homozygosity (F|>0.1),
high pairwise relatedness (pi-hat >0.2), or mismatch be-
tween recorded and genotypic sex. Following QC, the data for
eachplatformwerephasedusingSHAPEIT,51version3.4.0.1023
(OlivierDelaneau),andimputedwithIMPUTE2,52version2.3.0
(University of Oxford), using the 1000 Genomes Project ref-
erence panel (phase 3). Imputed data were converted into the
most probable genotypes (probability >0.9) and merged on
shared SNPs. After QC, 4399 BD cases remained.
CLOZUK Cases and Controls
The CLOZUK and control samples went through strict QC sepa-
ratelybeforebeingphasedandimputedsimultaneouslyaspart
of a larger SCZ study.47
Merging Imputed Genotypic Data Sets
After SNPs with stand ambiguity were excluded, BD, CLOZUK,
and control samples were merged and the imputed markers
underwent a second QC filter.50 This second QC excluded SNPs
with a missingness rate of more than 5% of individuals, an in-
formation content score lower than 0.8, an MAF of less than
0.01, or deviation from HWE at P < 1 × 10−6.
Principal Component Analysis
To adjust for potential confounding from population structure,
we performed principal components analysis. We used PLINK,
version 1.9 (Christopher Chang), after pruning the linkage dis-
equilibrium and frequency filtering the SNPs from the merged
sample, keeping the eigenvectors for the first 10 principal com-
ponents to use as covariates in the association analysis.
Polygenic Risk Scores
We generated the PRSs20 using the 2014 Psychiatric Genom-
ics Consortium-SCZ meta-analysis as our discovery set21 cal-
culated for each individual on the basis of a set of alleles with
association P < .05. This decision was informed by the Psy-
chiatricGenomicsConsortiumleave-one-cohort-outPRSanaly-
ses for all SNP selection P value thresholds, which found the
median and the mode was P = .05, which represents the as-
sociation that best optimizes the balance of false and true risk
alleles at the current discovery sample size.21 The most infor-
mative and independent markers were selected to minimize
statistical noise where possible, by using P value–informed
clumping at r2 < 0.2 with 1-MB windows and by excluding the
extended major histocompatibility complex (chromosome 6:
position 25-35 MB) because of its complex linkage disequilib-
rium structure.
Outcome Measure of Lifetime Psychosis
and Mood Incongruence
Subtypes of BD
The RDC subtypes were used as categorical outcomes in case-
control analyses. The RDC3 and the DSM-5,2 although not the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health-
Related Disorders, Tenth Revision, Classification of Mental and
Behavioural Disorders,1 subdivides BD into bipolar I disorder
(BD I) and bipolar II disorder (BD II) depending on the nature
of the mood states, mania in BD I, and hypomania in BD II. All
classification systems recognize SABD. Psychotic symptoms
are most prominent in SABD and then BD I and are least promi-
nent in BD II.53,54
Bipolar Affective Disorder Dimension Scale
Outcome measures were generated from the Bipolar Affec-
tive Disorder Dimension Scale (BADDS) subscales of psycho-
sis and mood incongruence, which provide an ordered, but not
necessarily linear, measure of lifetime symptom domain
severity.55Aninterraterreliabilityexerciseforthissampledem-
onstrates excellent interclass correlation: (psychosis) 0.91 and
(mood incongruence) 0.89.
1. A binary categorical outcome measure for lifetime occur-
rence of psychosis, defined as an unambiguous episode of
positive and/or disorganized psychotic symptoms, gener-
ated by dichotomizing the psychosis domain scale at a score
higher than 9.55
2. A binary categorical outcome measure for lifetime occur-
rence of predominant mood-incongruent psychotic fea-
tures, defined as high or low prominence of mood incongru-
ence, generated by dichotomizing the mood incongruence
domain scale at a score higher than 19.
3. An ordinal measure of mood-incongruent psychotic fea-
tures that assesses the overall balance between mood-
congruent and mood-incongruent psychosis across the life-
time, rated using all available information according to the
Bipolar Disorder Research Network protocol (see eNote 1 in
the eAppendix in the Supplement).

zoaffective BD (RR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.22-1.54), BD I (RR = 1.30;
95% CI, 1.24-1.36), and BD II (RR = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.11).
PRS Associations Within Cases
The PRSs discriminated SCZ from all BD subtypes (Table 2).
Within BD, the PRSs discriminated BD II from both BD I and
SABD (Figure 1). The percentage of CLOZUK cases increased
monotonically with increasing decile of PRS, while the per-
centage of bipolar subtypes decreased (Figure 2).
PRS Associations With Psychotic BD
Compared with controls, the PRSs were higher in BD, regard-
less of whether there was a history of psychosis (Table 1 and
Figure 2). However, the PRSs were significantly higher in BD
with psychosis, compared with BD without psychosis (Table 1
and Figure 3). Within BD cases, PRSs discriminated those with
and without psychosis (RR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.16-1.33; P < .001).

(RR = 1.38;95%CI,1.31-1.46).Thisassociationwassignificantly
stronger than that of the composite BD I without psychosis
(RR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08-1.25). Within BD II, there was no differ-
ential association across subgroups, defined by presence or ab-
senceofpsychosis,ascomparedwiththedifferentialassociation
in controls (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
PRSAssociationsWithMood-Incongruent
PsychoticFeatures
Psychotic BD characterized by high mood incongruence had
a higher SCZ polygenic risk burden than that in controls,
with a 1-SD increase in PRS increasing the RR of being in the
high mood-incongruence category by 46% (RR = 1.46; 95%
CI, 1.36-1.57) (Figure 3 and Table 1). Although the associa-
tion was significantly weaker than for the high mood-
incongruent group, SCZ risk alleles were enriched in those
with low mood-incongruence, compared with controls
(RR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.33). Sensitivity analysis excluding
the SABD group from analyses found comparable results
(Table 1). Finally, a within-BD case analysis, measuring
mood incongruence on an ordinal scale, found the odds of
having higher levels of mood incongruence increased with
increasing PRS (OR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.27; P < .001).
Analyses excluding the SABD sample found comparable
results (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32; P < .001).

lows: the PRSs were constructed using alleles derived from a

BD sample.61 This group has shown that PRS-SCZ significantly
differentiatesSABDfromnon-SABDsubtypes,whilefindingno
statistically significant differential between BD stratified by

toms rather than their presence that better indexes the liability

sion, by the SABD diagnostic category.
Psychosis and mood-incongruent psychotic features are
known to be correlated with poorer prognosis and treatment
response.30-32 It is possible the transdiagnostic exposure-
response gradient for the PRS, with the occurrence and na-
ture of psychotic symptoms presented here, could be the re-
sult of a general psychopathological factor that cuts across
psychiatric disorders and influences the severity of psycho-
pathology generally as well as, or rather than, a psychosis-
specific domain. The PRS derived from SCZ-GWAS may be in-
dexing a general liability for psychopathological severity (at
least in part)63 rather than a (SCZ) disease-specific liability.
Implications
Our study supports the hypothesis that, within BD, positive
and disorganized psychotic symptoms—particularly, mood-
incongruent psychotic features—represent a dimensionally de-
fined stratum with underpinning biological validity. These fea-
tures are not only phenotypically similar to those observed in
prototypal SCZ but also index a greater shared-genetic liability,
which suggests BD and SCZ share more pathophysiological
features.64Notably,inthosediagnosedwithBDIwithnohistory
of psychosis, the association with SCZ liability was weaker but
still higher than in the control group, while there was no over-
lapwithSCZliabilityintheBDIIsubsample.Wearenotsuggest-

current GWAS.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this study is the first to show a gradient of
polygenic liability across SCZ and BD, indexed by the occur-
rence and level of mood incongruence of positive and disor-
ganized psychotic symptoms. These results highlight the use-
fulness of genetic data to dissect clinical heterogeneity within
and across disorders and suggest further research could po-
tentially aid in defining patient stratifiers with improved bio-
logicalprecisionandvalidity,movingustentativelytowardpre-
cision medicine in psychiatry.
