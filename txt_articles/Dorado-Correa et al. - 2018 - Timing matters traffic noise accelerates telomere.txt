Abstract
Background: Noise pollution is one of the leading environmental health risks for humans, linked to a myriad of
stress-related health problems. Yet little is known about the long-term effects of noise on the health and fitness of
wildlife. We experimentally investigated the direct and cross-generational effects of traffic noise on telomeres; a
measure of cellular ageing that is predictive of disease and longevity in humans and other organisms. We exposed
zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata) to three different treatment groups: 1) parents were exposed to traffic noise
before and during breeding, together with their nestling young, 2) fledged juveniles but not their parents were
exposed to traffic noise, and 3) control group birds were never exposed to traffic noise.
Results: Although there was no significant effect of traffic noise exposure at early (pre-fledging) stages of offspring
telomere length or loss rate, traffic noise exposure accelerated telomere loss in older (post-fledging) juveniles.
Conclusions: The age-dependent differences found in this study in telomere loss could occur if parents buffer
younger offspring against the detrimental effects of noise exposure and/or if younger offspring are less sensitive to
noise exposure. Telomere length during early life has been shown to be positively related to lifespan and the observed
noise-induced increase of telomere attrition rate could reduce the fitness of the affected birds and potentially alter the
population dynamics of birds in noise polluted areas. Our data highlight the need to consider the developmental stage
of an organism to better understand the ecological consequences of anthropogenic change.

Background
Rapid environmental change due to urbanization, can be
detrimental for many organisms, including humans [1–3].
The growth of urban areas is linked to severe environ-
mental contamination, including chemical, light, and noise
pollution and these anthropogenic changes can often be
regarded as environmental stressors [4]. For example, in
humans and other mammals, noise is related to delays in
brain development, impaired cognitive function and defi-
cits in learning and memory as well as high blood
pressure, hyperglycemia, and elevated cholesterol levels
[5–12]. However, to understand the causal effects of
urbanization on organisms it is important to identify
model systems that can be experimentally manipulated.
Such investigations are necessary to disentangle the im-
pacts of different environmental factors associated with
urban habitats on the development, health, behaviour, and
fitness of exposed individuals.
Moreover, the mechanisms that underlie the negative
effects of increased noise exposure on health and fitness
are poorly understood. In diverse organisms, environ-
mental conditions experienced during early life often
have delayed impacts on phenotypic development and
fitness [13, 14]. Telomere loss is a mechanism that may
provide a link between early stress exposure and longev-
ity [15]. Telomeres are non-coding, repetitive DNA se-
quences that cap the ends of eukaryote chromosomes
and enhance genome stability [16]. Telomeres shorten
during cell division and limit cellular lifespan [16] and
telomere length has often been shown to be positively

 associated with longevity [17]. Telomeres have also been
shown to shorten in response to stress in mammals and
some birds [17–19].
In humans and in birds, there is also evidence that
stress experienced by parents can impact offspring telo-
mere length and loss rate [20–29]. For example, human
mothers that reported experiencing stressful conditions
during pregnancy produced offspring with shorter telo-
meres at birth [22] and in adulthood [21]. As these stud-
ies are necessarily correlative it is difficult to separate
cause and effect. But, these findings are also supported
by a recent experimental study in birds where experi-
mentally elevated stress hormone levels in the yolk re-
sulted in chicks with shorter telomeres at the end of
post-natal development [20]. However, the relative im-
portance of stress exposure experienced by parents and
offspring at different developmental stages has rarely
been disentangled.
Information regarding effects of urbanization on telo-
mere length or attrition rates in birds is still scarce.
However, two recent studies have found links between
urbanization and telomere length in juvenile songbirds.
In a cross-fostering experiment, it was found that great
tits (Parus major) reared from 2 days of age in urban en-
vironments had significantly shorter telomeres at 15 days
of age than birds reared in rural areas [30]. It remains
unclear which aspects of urbanization may have contrib-
uted to this effect of living in an urban environment on
telomere dynamics. In another study, playback of traffic
noise in the field resulted in shorter telomeres in
9-day-old house sparrows (Passer domesticus) [31]. In
addition, one field study showed that telomere length
may predict post-fledging survival and recruitment of
great tits in urban and rural areas. However, in urban
environments adult great tits had longer telomeres, on
average than tits in rural populations, possibly due to se-
lective disappearance of individuals with shorter telo-
meres in early life [32]. Yet, neither of these studies
investigated
whether
exposure
to
traffic
noise
had
longer-term
effects
on
telomere
attrition
rates,
or
whether chronic noise exposure affects individuals at dif-
ferent ontogenetic stages.
We experimentally tested for direct and cross-gener-
ational effects of traffic noise exposure across develop-
mental stages in zebra finches bred in aviaries in our
laboratory. In this experiment we compared telomere
lengths at 21 and 120 days post-hatch in (1) birds that
hatched to parents that were exposed to noise during
courtship, egg-laying, and nestling care periods, with the
offspring themselves also exposed to noise until ca.
18 days post-hatch, (2) birds that hatched to non-noise
exposed parents, but which were themselves exposed to
noise from day 18 to 120, and (3) controls in which nei-
ther the parents nor the chicks were exposed to noise. If
physiological stress responses in female birds during
courtship and egg-laying are elevated due to chronic noise
exposure, their eggs could contain more maternal gluco-
corticoids than those of non-stressed females. Therefore,
we hypothesized that the offspring of noise-stressed fe-
males may have elevated levels of glucorcorticoids and/or
oxidative damage, both of which could result in shorter
telomeres. If the effects of noise as a stressor are direct, ra-
ther than cross-generational, we predicted that offspring
who were chronically exposed to noise themselves would
suffer higher rates of telomere loss, but those whose par-
ents had noise exposure would not suffer the same degree
of telomere damage.
Methods
Study system
We bred adult zebra finches (2–3 years old) from the col-
onies at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in See-
wiesen, Germany. Each of three experimental rooms
consisted of three aviaries (1 × 2 × 2 m), each housing 7–8
pairs of birds. Each aviary was provided with 12 wooden
nest boxes and ad libitum nesting materials, seeds, com-
mercial finch egg food and water. In addition, birds were
provided with fresh vegetables and hard-boiled eggs twice
weekly throughout the experimental period. Our experi-
mental birds were the offspring of these breeding adults.
Each aviary produced an average of 29 offspring (16–42),
with a total of 263 offspring from all treatment groups. Off-
spring that died before they reached 120 days post-hatch
were not included in the experiment. Animal housing and
care was all in accordance with European and local laws
governing the care and use of laboratory animals (Council
of Europe Treaty ETS-123). All experimental procedures
were approved by and done under license from the Gov-
ernment of Upper Bavaria (Regierung von Oberbayern), li-
cence number 55.2–1–54-2532-51-2013.
Experimental treatment
To determine if typical city traffic noise affects telomere
dynamics in juvenile birds, we designed three noise expos-
ure treatments: 1) the parents were exposed to noise dur-
ing
breeding,
egg-laying
and
nestling
care
periods
(PNoise), 2) juvenile birds were exposed to noise exposure
from fledging throughout the sensory motor learning
period, 18–120 days post-hatch (JNoise), and 3) a control
group that was not exposed to noise at any time point
(NoNoise) (Additional file 1: Table S1). Thus, the offspring
in the PNoise treatment group were not exposed to traffic
noise after fledging, and the offspring in the JNoise treat-
ment were not exposed before fledging, nor were their
parents. The PNoise group had a total of 95 offspring
from 32 broods, the JNoise group 59 from 17 broods, and
the control group (NoNoise) had 109 offspring from 35
broods. The difference in sample size between treatments

 is because the parents of the treatments PNoise and NoN-
oise bred twice, once in PNoise and once in NoNoise
treatments. To control for potential effects of breeding ex-
perience we considered the number of breeding rounds in
the statistical analysis (see below).
Noise playback consisted of 80, 5-min long recordings
of street traffic noise, which was recorded at several busy
intersections in Munich, Germany during April 2013.
During the daylight hours (06:30–20:30), the 80 record-
ings were played continuously, in randomized order,
with playback levels (measured at the position of the
nest boxes) averaging between 65 and 85 dB(A) re 20
μPa. Nighttime playback (20:30–06:30) consisted of ran-
domized playback of 40 noise recordings, which were
less dense in the rate of passing than the daytime re-
cordings and were reduced in overall amplitude, with
playback
level
averages
ranging
between
45
and
75 dB(A). Therefore, noise playback mimicked typical
urban noise patterns, according to published noise maps
[33]. We played noise from a laptop computer to an
array of 12 pairs of amplified portable speakers (Hama
Sonic Mobil 400 Alu PS1032), with 4 pairs arranged
above each of the three aviaries in the room. Noise play-
back was run using a script written in MatLab (version
7.5.0;
Natick,
MA,
USA;
www.mathworks.com)
to
randomize playback during day and night. For the
PNoise group, playback of noise began 4 weeks before
the introduction of nesting materials and nest boxes and
continued until the median juvenile in the room had
fledged (the date when half of the offspring had fledged).
For the JNoise group, the noise playback began when
the median juvenile was 18 days post-hatch, and contin-
ued until all juveniles had reached 120 days.
Telomere measurement
Blood samples were collected by brachial venipuncture for
each bird at 21 and 120 days post-hatch to measure telo-
mere length and loss rate. Telomere length at 25 days has
previously been shown to be positively related to lifespan
in zebra finches [17]. Blood was collected into heparinized
capillary tubes (1.4 × 75 mm), transferred into Eppendorf
tubes, and centrifuged to separate the cells from the
plasma. The cells were then stored at − 80 °C until DNA
extraction. We analyzed samples for 263 birds in total,
137 females, and 126 males, at both ages. We used the
DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) to extract genomic
DNA from the red blood cells following the manufac-
turer’s protocol. We used a NanoDrop 8000 spectropho-
tometer (Thermo Scientific) to measure the quantity of
the DNA. To measure relative telomere length we used
quantitative PCR (Stratagene MX3000P), as described in
[34], and adapted to zebra finches [35].
The relative telomere length of each sample was mea-
sured by calculating the ratio (T/S) of telomere repeat
copy number (T) to single control gene copy number
(S), relative to a reference sample. As the control gene,
we used the Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). The following forward and reverse primers
were used to amplify the telomere: Tel1b (5′-CGGT
TTGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGG
TT-3′), Tel2b (5′-GGCTTGCCTTACCCTTACCCTTA
CCCTTACCCTTACCCT-3′) and zebra finch-specific
GAPDH sequences: GAPDH-F (5′-AACCAGCCAAGT
ACGATGACAT-3′), GAPDH-R (5′-CCATCAGCAGCA
GCCTTCA-3′). The telomere and GAPDH reactions
were carried out on different plates, the number of PCR
cycles required for the products to accumulate enough
fluorescent signals to cross a threshold was determined.
The detailed description of the conditions of the PCR
can be found in [35]. A standard curve was included to
measure the efficiencies of the reactions on every plate.
The reference sample was from a zebra finch that was
21 days old at the time of collection. The efficiencies
were within
an acceptable
range
(plate mean ± SD
GADPH
100.82 ± 3.31;

in
all
cases. All samples, including the standard curve, were
run in triplicate, and average values were used to calcu-
late the relative T/S ratios for each sample relative to the
reference sample (for details see [17]). All of the sam-
ples of an individual were run on the same plate, i.e.
the samples from each individual, taken on day 21
and 120 were run in the same plate in triplicate. In
total, 23 plates were run for telomeres and GAPDH.
The mean ± SD intraplate coefficient of variation of
the Ct values was calculated per plate by dividing the
standard deviation by the mean of the 20 ng concen-
tration wells in the standard curve, multiplied by 100
(3 replicates). As a result, we got 1.99 ± 1.00 intraplate
variation for the telomere assays and 0.15 ± 0.09 for
the GAPDH assays, respectively. The average inter-
plate variation for the ΔCt values was 3.96% and was
calculated using the standard deviation value of ΔCt
of the 20 ng wells of the standard curve of all plates
divided by the mean, multiplied by 100.
Paternity analysis
To account for possible genetic effects on telomere loss,
we considered the identity of parents in the analysis (see
below). Since there is typically a considerable amount of
extra pair young in captive zebra finch colonies [36],
genetic paternity analysis is necessary to reliably assign
parentage. To this end, all offspring were genotyped at
11 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers [37] and
parentage was assigned by exclusion.
Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed with R 3.1.1 (R
Core Team 2013). We fitted linear mixed-effects models
Dorado-Correa et al. Frontiers in Zoology           (2018) 15:29

 to analyze our data, using the “lmer” function (package
lme4). Additionally, we used the “sim” function (package
arm) to simulate the posterior distribution of the model
parameters and values were extracted based on 2000 sim-
ulations [38]. The statistical significance of fixed effects
and interactions were assessed based on the 95% credible
intervals (CI) around the mean (estimate). We considered
an effect to be “significant” in the frequentist’s sense (p <
0.05) when the 95% CI did not overlap zero [39]. Telo-
mere length (log-transformed) was set as the dependent
variable, treatment (NoNoise, PNoise, JNoise), age when
the sample was taken (21 or 120 days old), sex, mass of
every individual at 21 and 120 days (mass) and breeding
round as independent factors. Breeding round is the num-
ber of times the adults have reproduced. The individual
ID, the ID of the genetic parents, and the aviary (to ac-
count for effects of the common aviary) were included as
random effects. Genetic parentage was determined by ex-
clusion using the R package SOLOMON [40]. The model
used in the paper included interaction between treatment
and age and was compared to other models using the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), REML was set to
FALSE [41]. The repeatability was calculated based on
random effects of the model, for the individual repeatabil-
ity parents ID were not taken into account.
Results
Telomere length decreased with age in all treatment
groups (Table 1, Fig. 1). At 21 days, telomere lengths
did not significantly differ between treatments (mean ±
SD NoNoise: 1.40 ± 0.55 T/S ratio; PNoise: 1.46 ±
0.53 T/S ratio; JNoise: 1.46 ± 0.50 T/S ratio). The
JNoise group experienced significantly greater telomere
shortening between days 21 and 120 days than the
PNoise and NoNoise groups (Table 1, Fig. 1 and Add-
itional file 1: Figure S1). Zebra finch juveniles exposed
to noise post-fledging (JNoise treatment) had shorter
telomeres at 120 days (mean ± SD: 0.87 ± 0.33 T/S ratio)
than the offspring from the PNoise treatment (mean ±
SD: 1.17 ± 0.42 T/S ratio) and NoNoise treatment
(mean ± SD: 1.19 ± 0.53 T/S ratio) groups. The estimate
of individual repeatability was 0.38 CI 0.27, 0.47. The
estimate of mother repeatability was 0.19 CI 0.07, 0.31
and father repeatability was 0.08 CI 0.05, 0.29. The
values of telomere length at 21 days in all three groups
were within the range of telomere lengths found in pre-
vious studies in zebra finches [17]. There were no sig-
nificant effects of sex, breeding round, or body mass on
telomere length (Table 1).
Discussion
This study is the first to experimentally examine the ef-
fects of traffic noise on telomere length and attrition rate
under controlled laboratory conditions. We found that
traffic noise had a direct impact on the rate of telomere
loss in post-fledge juvenile zebra finches. However, there
were no significant effects of noise experienced by parents,
or directly by nestlings at an earlier developmental stage
(pre-fledging). At day 21 post-hatch, birds from the three
different treatments did not differ significantly in telomere
length. Importantly though, we found that the juveniles
directly exposed to noise during the post-fledging period
(18 to 120 days post-hatch) experienced significantly more
telomere shortening and had significantly shorter telo-
meres at 120 days than birds in the control treatment, or
those whose parents were exposed to noise. Therefore,
noise exposure during the later stages of ontogeny (be-
tween 18 and 120 days) resulted in an increased rate of
telomere loss. We did not find significant differences in
telomere length or attrition rates between sexes. Our data
suggest that juveniles that experience traffic noise will
have greater telomere attrition, which may serve as a bio-
marker that predicts reduced longevity with negative con-
sequences for fitness.
The pattern of noise-induced telomere loss in older ju-
veniles may suggest that zebra finches are less sensitive
to traffic noise when exposure occurs while they are still
in the nest. One explanation is that the expression of tel-
omerase, the enzyme that repairs telomeres, may be in-
creased during some developmental stages. In zebra

 finches, telomerase activity is highest during the hatch-
ling age period, when the proliferative demands of most
organs are the highest [42], which may mean that very
young birds are buffered against stress-induced telomere
loss by higher rates of repair, compared to older juve-
niles. However, two field studies on other songbird spe-
cies
have found
differences
in
telomere
length
in
response to noise exposure or urbanization as early as
day 9 and day 15 [30, 31]. Alternatively, it could be that
the effect was more pronounced during young adult-
hood in zebra finches because the period between18 and
120 days post-hatch is a critical period. Zebra finches
typically leave the nest around day 18 and continue to
be fed entirely or partially by their parents or other
adults until approximately 30 days post-hatch when ju-
veniles become independent from their parents. In
addition to the stress of weaning from parental nutri-
tional support, this time period (ca. day 20) is approxi-
mately when zebra finches enter the song learning
period [43]. This could mean that birds are more sensi-
tive to noise or that it is a more potent stressor during
this stage, than at earlier life stages. Corroborative evi-
dence for this notion comes from a recent study that
found that noise exposure affects the size of brain re-
gions associated with song learning in zebra finches dur-
ing their song learning period although it did not affect
corticosterone levels [44].
There are many reasons that noise experienced by par-
ents or by offspring at earlier stages may not have af-
fected offspring telomeres. For example if parents in
noisy environments make behavioural changes, this
could potentially mitigate any negative effects of noise
exposure on telomere loss to their offspring and/or if
parents habituate to noise in the weeks before eggs are
produced. Previous studies have found that parental be-
haviours often change in the presence of noise [45]
which can reduce reproductive success [46, 47] . In our
study, it could be that parents exposed to traffic noise

 found ways to alleviate the effect of noise on their off-
spring. Such mitigation could have been mediated by in-
creased parental care behaviour or even earlier in the
gamete formation stage. For example, if young chicks (<
18 days) experienced higher rates of telomere loss than
controls, noise-exposed parents may have produced off-
spring with longer telomeres at hatching, which were
then lost at a higher rate during their first 20 days
post-hatch. Thus, this rapid change may be indistin-
guishable from the other treatment groups when the
first samples were taken at day 21. However, when the
noise treatment ceased at day 18, their rate of telomere
loss may have decreased, so that the rate of loss from
that point matched that of the control birds. Alterna-
tively, it may be that noise-exposed parents invest more
in parental care, which may buffer noise-induced telo-
mere loss, and as a result telomere length in their off-
spring is not significantly different to offspring from the
control group. Such an adjustment of parental care
could, at least partly, be triggered by the chicks, e.g.,
hatchlings increase the amplitude of their begging calls
in noise [48], which may increase feeding rates by the
parents. Additionally, it could be that the parents in
noise habituated to the noise before their eggs were pro-
duced, or offspring hatched, then the lack of an effect of
noise exposure on the young from noise-exposed par-
ents might reflect this habituation, whereas in the JNoise
treatment, the noise exposure may have occurred at a
more vulnerable time in the young birds’ lives. However,
whether the parents were able to habituate to noise is
unknown. While they had noise exposure for 3 weeks
before nest building began, the noise treatment also
began for them at a sensitive time in their life histories.
It was present as soon as they were added to a new
mixed sex aviary. Therefore, they were in an early stage
of pair formation and getting used to a new flock com-
position, which is also a vulnerable period.
Telomere length in zebra finches is thought to be herit-
able [49], and this is supported by our data, wherein parents
explain 27% of the variation in our model. However,
whether rates of telomere attrition are also heritable is not
clear.
We
found
that
juveniles
exposed
to
noise
post-fledging had higher rates of attrition, even though their
telomere length at day 21 was not different from the other
groups (Additional file 1: Figure S1). This suggests that en-
vironmental conditions, in this case traffic noise, have an
impact on the attrition rate of telomeres in juvenile zebra
finches, regardless of inherited differences in telomere
length. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the dif-
ferences observed between our groups, and the degree to
which heritability may impact rates of telomere loss inde-
pendent of environmental conditions needs further study.
The first sample in our study was taken when juveniles
were 21 days old post-hatch, around 10 days after the
sampling day in other studies [30, 31]. In contrast to this
prior research [30, 31], our results showed that traffic
noise exposure did not have an effect on telomere
length. That our birds did not respond to traffic noise
exposure in the same way as the birds in these previous
studies may be an indicator of species differences in sen-
sitivity to traffic noise, or may represent a difference be-
tween how captive birds and wild birds respond to
noise. It may also be that in our study, parents were ex-
posed to noise continuously (like in the city) and while
our playback consisted of randomized, unpredictable
fluctuations in noise, parents may have habituated more
to this chronic noise condition than to shorter daily pe-
riods of playback, such as in Meillère et al. (2015).
Conclusions
Our study contributes critical new data to our understand-
ing of the long-term effects of traffic noise pollution on
avian health and fitness. We show that chronic exposure to
realistic levels of traffic noise increases rates of telomere
loss in older, but not very young juvenile zebra finches.
Since telomere length has been shown to predict longevity
in zebra finches [17], a noise-induced increase of telomere
attrition rate may serve as a biomarker for reduced
long-term survival, which, eventually, may even affect
population dynamics of birds in noise polluted areas. Previ-
ous evidence in juvenile great tits suggests that urban envi-
ronments increase rates of telomere loss [32]. However, our
study suggests that anthropogenic noise alone, independent
from the many other urban factors, increases telomere loss
and may contribute to organismal ageing. Urbanization
consists of a complex suite of ecological changes, and our
study is a first step towards identifying the causal mecha-
nisms that may underlie differences observed between
urban dwellers and their rural conspecifics. As suggested by
our findings, it is essential to consider developmental stage
and parental effects when studying these mechanisms and
how they ultimately affect eco-evolutionary processes.

 represent the treatments: parents exposed to noise (orange circles), juveniles
exposed to noise themselves (red circles) and control (blue circles). The lines
show the regression lines per treatment. Figure S2. scatter plot of telomere
length values of zebra finches obtained with Cawthon method against Pfaffl
method. According to Pearson correlation test the values are highly
correlated (0.95, p-value < 2.2e-16). Table S4. Outcome of linear models
testing the effects of noise on the telomere length of juvenile zebra finches
that had parents exposed to noise (PNoise), or that were themselves
exposed to noise (JNoise) and a no-noise control group. The asterisks
represent “significant” differences in the frequentist’s sense, i.e. when the
95% credible intervals did not overlap zero [39]. This data did not include
the outline point from treatment JNoise. (PDF 137 kb)
