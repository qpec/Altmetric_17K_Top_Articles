Abstract
Aims—The hypothesis of “metabolically healthy obesity” implies that, in the absence of 
metabolic dysfunction, individuals with excess adiposity are not at greater cardiovascular risk. We 
tested this hypothesis in a large pan-European prospective study.
Methods and results—We conducted a case-cohort analysis in the 520,000-person European 
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study (“EPIC-CVD”). During median follow-
up of 12.2 years, we recorded 7,637 incident coronary heart disease (CHD) cases. Using cut-offs 
recommended by guidelines, we defined obesity and overweight using BMI, and metabolic 
dysfunction (“unhealthy”) as ≥3 of elevated blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-
cholesterol, hyperglycemia, elevated waist circumference. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) within each country using Prentice-weighted Cox proportional 
hazard regressions, accounting for age, sex, centre, education, smoking, diet and physical activity. 
Compared to metabolically healthy normal weight people (reference), HRs were 2.15 (95%CI:

 1.79; 2.57) for unhealthy normal weight, 2.33 (1.97; 2.76) for unhealthy overweight, and 2.54 
(2.21; 2.92) for unhealthy obese people. Compared to the reference group, HRs were 1.26 (1.17; 
1.36) and 1.28 (1.05; 1.56) for metabolically healthy overweight and obese people, respectively. 
These results were robust to various sensitivity analyses.
Conclusion—Irrespective of BMI, metabolically unhealthy individuals had higher CHD risk 
than their healthy counterparts. Conversely, irrespective of metabolic health, overweight and obese 
people had higher CHD risk than lean people. These findings challenge the concept of 
“metabolically healthy obesity”, encouraging population-wide strategies to tackle obesity.

Introduction
Overall and abdominal obesity, commonly measured by body mass index (BMI) and waist 
circumference (WC), are important risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) (1–3). The 
effects of obesity on CHD are thought to be largely mediated by other cardiometabolic risk 
factors such as insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes (4). 
However, many obese people have few or no elevated metabolic risk factors included in the 
definition of the Metabolic Syndrome (5), suggesting that there may be a group of obese 
people – the “metabolically healthy obese” – who are not at higher cardiovascular risk (6). 
There is no consensus on the criteria to define this subtype, and an estimated 3 to 57% of 
obese individuals are considered “metabolically healthy obese” depending on the population 
under study and the definition used (7). There has been conflicting evidence on whether 
metabolically healthy obese people are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or 
type 2 diabetes (8–17), with recent meta-analyses challenging the concept of the 
metabolically healthy obesity by showing higher cardiovascular risk among obese 
individuals with no metabolic syndrome (14, 15, 17, 18). The existence of “metabolically 
healthy obesity” has also been questioned by the latest European Society of Cardiology 
(ESC) guidelines for CVD prevention (19). However, previous studies have been limited by 
incomplete adjustment for potentially important confounders (such as physical activity and 
smoking), short duration of follow-up (and hence small numbers of incident CHD events) 
and use of composite outcomes, such as all-cause mortality. More powerful and detailed 
studies with precisely defined outcomes are therefore needed to clarify the association with 
CHD risk, since heterogeneous effects of obesity according to metabolic health could have 
important implications for risk prevention strategies.
To address this, we analysed 7,637 incident CHD cases recorded during 12.2 years of 
follow-up from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 
cardiovascular disease (EPIC-CVD) case-cohort study. Our primary aim was to examine the 
separate and combined associations of obesity and metabolic health with CHD.

 Methods
Study population
EPIC-CVD is a prospective case-cohort study nested within the European Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Briefly, EPIC includes 366,521 
women and 153,457 men, mostly aged 35 to 70 years old at baseline, recruited between 
1991 and 1999 at 23 centres across 10 European countries: Denmark, France, Germany, 
Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Adults 
were invited from the local general population except in the French centre (women in a 
national health insurance plan), some Italian and Spanish centres (recruited through local 
blood donor associations), Utrecht (The Netherlands) and Florence (Italy) (women invited 
for population-based breast cancer screening programmes) and Oxford (UK) (specifically 
recruited a substantial proportion of vegetarians). At baseline, participants gave a blood 
sample and completed questionnaires on diet, lifestyle, and medical history. Detailed 
baseline characteristics of the EPIC cohort have been previously described (20).
A case-cohort study nested in a large prospective cohort is similar to a nested case-control 
study with the difference that a random subcohort is selected for use as a reference group, 
rather than matched controls. This design is efficient as it does not require all study 
participants to have exposure measurement and has the advantages of a longitudinal cohort 
study with prospective assessment of key exposures that are not subject to recall bias. Unlike 
the nested case-control design, it allows risk to be measured at any time until the end of 
follow-up and permits time-to-event analysis (21). A representative random subcohort of 
18,249 participants (62% women), stratified by centre, was selected for the EPIC-CVD 
project, constituting a case-cohort design. After exclusion of 609 participants with a prior 
history of myocardial infarction or stroke at baseline, 17,640 subcohort members remained. 
In total in the EPIC study, 13,964 incident CHD cases developed during follow-up, of whom 
631 belong to the subcohort. Ethical review boards of the International Agency for Research 
on Cancer and all local institutions where participants had been recruited gave approval for 
the original EPIC study, and all participants gave written informed consent.
Blood pressure measurements were not available for the centres in Norway, Asturias, or 
Navarra, and WC was not recorded in Norway and Umea (22). These centres were excluded 
from the analyses, as well as the French centre due to the limited number of incident CHD 
events (n=41). Further exclusions were performed based on missing exposure and covariate 
data, described below. All analyses were performed in a sample restricted to participants 
with no missing data (complete-case analysis). Because exclusions due to missing data may 
result in a selected sample, we also used a multiple imputation approach as a sensitivity 
analysis to compare the results with the complete-case approach. A schematic representation 
of the EPIC-CVD case-cohort design and sample selection is given in Supplemental Figure 
1.
Definitions of obesity and metabolic disorders
Trained health professionals measured blood pressure (BP) (23), weight, height, and waist 
circumference (WC) (24), except in the France and Oxford centres where body size

 measurements were self-reported (25). BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by the 
square of height (m2). Obesity was defined according to the World Health Organization (26) 
as BMI≥30 kg/m2, overweight as 25≤BMI<30 kg/m2, and normal weight as 18.5≤BMI<25 
kg/m2. Underweight (BMI<18.5) participants were excluded due to the limited number 
(n=264, less than 1% of the subcohort).
Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose were measured in baseline 
serum samples on a Roche auto-analyser (Roche diagnostics, USA) and HbA1c was 
measured in the erythrocyte fraction using the Tosoh-G8 HPLC analyser (Tosoh Bioscience, 
Japan) at Stichting Huisartsen Laboratorium (Etten-Leur, Netherlands). Fasting status was 
available for 87% of participants. Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) was defined according to the 
2009 Joint Interim Statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on 
Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart 
Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and 
International Association for the Study of Obesity (5) as having three or more of the 
following metabolic abnormalities: 1) elevated BP, defined as systolic BP≥130 and/or 
diastolic BP≥85 mm Hg and/or use of antihypertensive medication at baseline and/or self-
reported history of hypertension; 2) hypertriglyceridemia, defined as 
triglycerides≥1.7mmol/L (150mg/dL) or current use of lipid-lowering medication at 
baseline; 3) low HDL-cholesterol, defined as <1.0mmol/L (40mg/dL) for men and 
<1.3mmol/L (50mg/dL) for women; 4) hyperglycemia, defined as fasting blood glucose 
≥5.6mmol/L (100mg/dL) or non-fasting blood glucose≥7.8mmol/L (140mg/dL, with fasting 
defined as ≥3 hours between last meal and blood draw (27)), and/or current use of 
antidiabetic medication at baseline and/or self-reported history of diabetes; or 5) elevated 
waist circumference, defined as WC≥94cm for men and WC≥80cm for women. Where 
information on fasting status was not available (23% of participants), the non-fasting cut-off 
was used for glucose. Diabetes was defined as a self-reported history and/or HbA1c≥6.5%.
Covariate definition
Validated questionnaires were used to obtain information on education, smoking habits, 
dietary intake (including alcohol intake), and physical activity at study baseline. The 
Cambridge Index of physical activity was derived by combining occupational with 
recreational activity level to produce four groups: active, moderately active, moderately 
inactive and inactive (28). Usual diet over the previous 12 months was assessed using 
validated country/centre-specific dietary questionnaires (24), allowing the calculation of 
food group, individual energy and nutrient intakes (derived from the EPIC nutrient database 
(29)). To summarize diet quality for adjustment purposes, we computed a Mediterranean diet 
score, ranging from 0-18, with greater scores given to higher intakes of fruit, vegetables, 
legumes, nuts, grains, and fish, lower intakes of red meat and dairy, and moderate intake of 
alcohol (30).
Outcome ascertainment
Incident CHD cases were defined as first CHD events, whether non-fatal or fatal, consisting 
of ICD-10 codes I20-I25, which include myocardial infarction, other acute ischemic heart 
diseases, chronic ischemic heart disease and angina pectoris (31). EPIC centres used 
Lassale et al.

 methods including self-report, linkage to primary and secondary care registers, hospital 
admissions and mortality data to ascertain events. Non-fatal CHD events were further 
validated by additional review of individual medical records and/or linkage with registries 
with validation rates ranging from 82% to 100% (32), while fatal CHD events were 
generally ascertained through mortality registries. End of follow-up for CHD events varied 
between centres and ranged between 2003 and 2010. Participants known to have left the 
country were considered lost to follow-up and censored at their date of last follow-up.
Statistical analyses
Characteristics of participants in the subcohort were described across body size phenotypes 
and compared using ANCOVA, giving adjusted least square means and percentages (and 
standard error) across the six phenotypes. Adjustments were made for centre, sex, age, 
education, smoking status and energy intake (for description of dietary intake only).
To assess the association of adiposity markers and metabolically-defined body size 
phenotypes with incident CHD, we used Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards 
models with robust standard errors to account for the case-cohort design (21). Age was the 
underlying time scale, with entry time defined as the participant’s age at recruitment and exit 
time as age at first fatal or non-fatal CHD event or censoring (whichever came first). For all 
analyses, we stratified the models by sex and centre. To account for the multi-country 
design, we followed a 2-stage approach where models were fitted separately within country 
and then country-specific HRs were combined using multivariate random-effects meta-
analysis (33).
To assess the shape of associations of BMI and WC with CHD risk, country-specific HRs 
were calculated by comparing quintiles (defined using all participants) of baseline adiposity 
values with the lowest quintile. The pooled hazard ratios were then plotted against mean 
values of the adiposity measure within each quintile, accompanied by a group-specific 
confidence interval derived only from the variance of the log risk in that category (including 
the reference quintile) (34). As associations were approximately log-linear, we calculated 
HRs associated with 1 standard deviation (SD) higher baseline value (4.10 kg/m2 for BMI, 
12.7 cm for WC). Heterogeneity between countries was quantified using the I2 statistic (35).
For analyses of adiposity measures, Model 0 was adjusted for baseline age and smoking 
status (never, former, current). Model 1 was further adjusted for highest educational level 
(no schooling/primary, secondary, vocational/university), physical activity, Mediterranean 
diet score, energy and alcohol intake. Model 2 was further adjusted for the different body 
size markers, i.e. WC for BMI and BMI for WC. In Model 3, to explore biological pathways 
potentially underlying the associations, we adjusted for baseline age, smoking status, and 
intermediate cardiovascular risk factors: blood cholesterol (total and HDL), systolic blood 
pressure and diabetes. Interactions on the multiplicative scale between BMI and WC and 
between BMI and MetS were formally tested.
For analyses of metabolically-defined body size phenotypes, Model A was adjusted for 
baseline age, smoking status (never, former, current) and highest educational level (no 
schooling/primary, secondary, vocational/university). To investigate the potential mediating

 effect of lifestyle habits (36, 37) on the association between metabolically-defined body size 
phenotypes and CHD risk, we compared Model A to Model B, which further included 
adjustment for physical activity (Cambridge index: inactive, moderately inactive, moderately 
active, active), alcohol consumption (g ethanol/day), Mediterranean diet score and energy 
intake (kcal/day).
The primary complete-case analyses included only participants with non-missing data on 
anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, blood biomarkers and all covariates, with 
sensitivity analyses that maximised the number of participants by only excluding those with 
missing data on the covariates in each analysis model. Additional sensitivity analyses 
performed were: 1) excluding the first 2 years of follow-up to minimise the potential for 
reverse causality; 2) including only “hard” CHD events, i.e. myocardial infarction and 
coronary death; 3) including only events validated with a high level of certainty; 4) 
restricting analyses to “never smokers” only to apply more rigid control for smoking; 5) 
separately for men and women to investigate potential differences by sex. For comparability 
with other studies, we also performed sensitivity analyses with different definitions of 
obesity or metabolic health: 6) excluding the WC criterion from the definition of MetS, 
modifying the definition of metabolically healthy to be <2 abnormalities (17, 38); 7) 
defining metabolically healthy participants as having none of four possible abnormalities 
(elevated blood pressure, triglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, low HDL-cholesterol); 8) using 
abdominal obesity index defined as WC≥102cm for men and WC≥88cm for women. For the 
latter, a model (Model C) was fitted including BMI as a continuous covariate. Finally, 9) we 
used a multiple imputation approach to impute the missing values for the non-systematically 
missing variables (i.e. after exclusion of the centres with no data on blood pressure or waist 
circumference). Five imputed datasets were generated and estimates were combined using 
Rubin’s rules.
All analyses were performed with SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and STATA MP 13.1. 
We summarize the key aspects of the modelling strategy in Supplemental Figure 2.
Results
After exclusions, there were 10,474 subcohort participants and 7,637 incident CHD cases 
(394 of whom are also in the subcohort) comprising a total of 17,733 participants who 
contributed 117,829 person-years at risk in the complete-case analysis. 63% of subcohort 
participants were female and the mean (SD) age and BMI were 53.6 (9.3) years and 26.1 
(4.1) kg/m2 respectively (Table 1). Median follow-up was 12.2 years (interquartile range: 9.7 
– 13.6). 15.8% of subcohort participants were obese, 25.6% had MetS, whilst 45.2% of 
obese participants were “metabolically healthy”. Metabolically healthy obese participants 
were younger and had lower BMI than obese participants with MetS (p<0.0001). The 
metabolically healthy obese had worse metabolic parameters (higher lipid levels, blood 
pressure, HbA1c, C-reactive protein), had higher red meat intake, were less likely to be 
current smokers, more likely to be inactive and less educated than healthy normal weight 
participants (all p<0.0001, Table 1). The proportion of obese participants ranged from 11% 
in the UK to 30% in Greece and the proportion of obese participants who were metabolically 
healthy ranged from 31.7% in Germany to 57.9% in Spain (Supplemental Table 1).

 Associations between body size and CHD
There was a positive approximately log linear association between BMI and CHD risk 
(Figure 1 and Table 2) after adjusting for potential confounders (Model 1): HR per-standard 
deviation = 1.25 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.32), p<0.0001. While the association was almost perfectly 
log-linear from quintile 1 to 4, departure from log-linearity was observed at the highest 
quintile. The risk of CHD almost doubled comparing the highest quintile (mean BMI = 32.7 
kg/m2) to the lowest quintile (mean BMI=21.5 kg/m2) (HR=1.96 [95% CI 1.66, 2.32], 
p<0.0001). The association was substantially less strong after adjustment for WC (HR =1.06 
[95% CI 0.97, 1.15], p=0.20), likely reflecting the effect of lean mass and peripheral adipose 
tissue. The association was also substantially attenuated in a model adjusted for intermediate 
cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure, total and HDL-cholesterol, diabetes) (HR 
=1.05 [95% CI 1.01, 1.10], p=0.03, Table 2). There was moderate heterogeneity across 
countries. Results were very similar in sensitivity analyses that use all available individuals 
with complete data for each model in turn (Supplemental Table 2). However, results with 
multiply imputed data showed that, despite being strongly attenuated, the HRs remained 
significant when adjusted for WC or for intermediate CVD risk factors (Supplemental Table 
3). WC also had positive approximately linear associations with CHD (Figure 1, Table 2), 
which were robust to adjustment for BMI (HR=1.24 [95% CI 1.10, 1.40], p<0.0001). 
Adjustment for cardiometabolic factors substantially attenuated the association (Figure 1, 
Table 2).
There was a significant interaction between BMI and WC (p=0.005), with a weaker 
association in the upper tertile of each anthropometric factor (Figure 2). For BMI, the HR 
per-standard deviation increase was 1.27 (95% CI 1.17, 1.38) in the lowest tertile of WC, 
whereas it was 1.10 (95% CI 1.03, 1.16) in the highest tertile. The association of WC with 
CHD was stronger at every level of BMI than any of the associations of BMI with CHD 
across the tertiles of WC: the HR per-standard deviation increase of WC was 1.65 (95% CI 
1.43, 1.89) in the lowest tertile of BMI and 1.29 (95% CI 1.21, 1.38) in the highest tertile of 
BMI.
Associations between metabolically-defined body size phenotypes and CHD
Compared to the normal weight participants without MetS (reference group), all other 
metabolically-defined body size phenotypes were at significantly higher risk of CHD 
(Figure 3) in a fully adjusted model (Model B). Metabolically healthy obese individuals 
were at higher risk of CHD (HR=1.28 [95% CI 1.03, 1.58], p=0.02) but this was 
considerably lower than the risk in metabolically unhealthy groups. MetS was strongly 
positively associated with CHD risk, regardless of adiposity, with a HR of 2.15 (95% CI 
1.79, 2.57: p<0.0001) for metabolically unhealthy normal weight participants with MetS and 
a HR of 2.54 (95% CI 2.21, 2.92: p<0.0001) in their obese counterparts. In a model only 
adjusted for age, smoking and educational level (not diet or physical activity), the HRs were 
as follows: 1.25 (95% CI 1.14, 1.38) and 1.27 (95% CI 1.03 – 1.57) in the healthy 
overweight and obese, and 2.17 (95% CI 1.82, 2.59), 2.35 (95% CI 2.02, 2.74) and 2.63 
(95% CI 2.30, 3.01) in the unhealthy normal weight, overweight and obese, respectively. 
Results were generally consistent across countries (Supplemental Figure 3; Figure 3). 
Similar results were obtained from models unadjusted for physical activity and diet (Model 
Lassale et al.

 A, footnote of Figure 3).There were no significant interactions between BMI and MetS 
(p=0.19).
Sensitivity analyses show similar results after excluding the first 2 years of follow-up 
(Supplemental Table 4), when analyses were restricted to “harder” CHD events only 
(Supplemental Table 5), or when restricting the sample to non-smokers only (Supplemental 
Table 6). Analyses restricted to events only validated to the highest level of certainty were 
qualitatively similar but less precise (Supplemental Table 7). There was no difference 
between men and women (p for interaction=0.63, Supplemental Table 8). Estimates from the 
multiple imputation showed similar trends with the exception of an HR of greater magnitude 
for the metabolically healthy obese (1.67 [95% CI 1.39; 1.99]) (Supplemental Table 3).
Sensitivity analyses using a definition of MetS that excludes the WC criterion showed 
somewhat stronger positive associations for all phenotypes (Supplemental Table 9). Results 
were qualitatively similar to the main analysis (but less precise) when a stricter definition of 
metabolically healthy was used (i.e. having none of the MetS abnormalities) (Supplemental 
Table 10). Finally, when obesity was defined by WC (and not by BMI), and MetS did not 
include the WC criteria, HRs were again qualitatively similar to the main analysis although 
somewhat stronger (Supplemental Table 11). When further adjusted for BMI, HRs were 
attenuated. Agreement between the two definitions of metabolically-defined body size 
phenotypes where body size is defined by BMI or by WC was only moderate, with a 
weighted kappa of 0.667 (Supplemental Table 12).
Discussion
In this prospective case-cohort study with 7,637 CHD cases from 8 European countries 
followed-up for a median of 12.2 years, we assessed the separate and combined effects of 
body size and metabolic health on CHD. We observed higher CHD risk for general and 
central adiposity, as defined by BMI and WC, respectively. Whilst the effect of BMI was 
substantially attenuated on adjustment for WC, the effect of WC appeared to be robust to 
adjustment for BMI. Metabolically healthy overweight and obese individuals were at higher 
risk of CHD compared to their normal weight counterparts. However, CHD risk in 
metabolically unhealthy individuals was markedly higher than in their metabolically healthy 
counterparts across all BMI categories.
Our study, which is the largest to address this question in terms of the number of incident 
CHD events, suggests that “metabolically healthy” obesity is not a benign condition. This is 
of particular importance as overweight people (BMI ≥25 and <30) with no traditional 
cardiometabolic risk factors are not recommended for weight loss treatment by recent UK or 
US guidelines (39, 40). The risk of CHD in metabolically healthy overweight or obese 
individuals was significantly lower than in the “metabolically unhealthy” groups, suggesting 
that obese and overweight individuals without metabolic abnormalities are at intermediate 
cardiovascular risk between metabolically healthy normal weight individuals and 
metabolically unhealthy individuals. In support of this hypothesis, we showed that only 6% 
of the obese had strictly no cardiometabolic abnormality vs 31% of the normal weight, and 
that metabolically healthy obese individuals have worse cardiometabolic health than their

 normal weight counterparts, reflected by higher blood pressure, HbA1c, pro-atherogenic 
lipids, and C-reactive protein. These data concur with studies that used repeated 
measurements to evaluate the evolution of metabolically healthy obesity over time, showing 
that metabolically healthy obese people were more likely to go on to develop metabolic 
abnormalities (and become metabolically unhealthy obese) than their normal weight 
counterparts (41–47). Despite being acknowledged as a risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease, excess weight is not included in the prediction model SCORE (48). This algorithm 
estimates the 10 year risk of fatal CVD and its use is recommended by the ESC Guidelines 
for CVD risk assessment of patients to assist health professionals in their prevention and 
treatment strategies (19). Our results suggest that, even in the absence of multiple traditional 
CVD risk factors (smoking, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol), 
weight-loss strategies through intensive lifestyle advice (diet, exercise and behaviour 
modifications) or medical therapy (orlistat or bariatric surgery) should be recommended for 
obese patients to try to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight to decrease CVD risk. 
Overall, these results support a population-wide strategy for prevention of obesity and 
overweight regardless of the initial metabolic status of individuals.
In accordance with previous evidence on CVD, type 2 diabetes, breast and colorectal cancer 
(14, 17, 49–51), normal weight individuals with metabolic abnormalities had twice the risk 
of normal weight individuals without metabolic abnormalities. This is consistent with the 
adverse effects of metabolic factors in cardiovascular health, which are independent of 
obesity and accumulation of fat, and could involve inflammation, high blood pressure, 
lipotoxicity and atherosclerosis (4, 52). We also found that a higher WC was associated with 
higher risk of CHD at all levels of BMI, including for those in the normal weight category. 
This is in line with pooled results from 11 prospective studies which found a linear positive 
association between WC and mortality risk at all levels of BMI ranging from 20 to 50 kg/m2 
(53), advocating for the importance of an increased waistline at whole spectrum of BMI. 
Furthermore, a growing body of literature based on novel imaging markers has shown 
heterogeneity in the cardiovascular phenotype of obesity depending on location of adipose 
depots, with increased risk observed with visceral adipose tissue compared to subcutaneous 
fat (54–56). This implies that targeted visceral fat loss, rather than overall weight loss, may 
be a more efficient treatment of obesity to prevent cardiovascular events. Medical therapy 
with orlistat, which leads to greater reduction in visceral adipose tissue compared to placebo 
in clinical trials (57, 58), is a treatment option recommended by the latest ESC guidelines 
(19).
Positive associations between BMI and WC and CHD are also consistent with previous 
evidence (1–4). Our study confirms both the shape and magnitude of a combined analysis of 
39 prospective studies (5,259 CHD cases) by the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (3), 
which found a HR of 1.29 (1.22-1.37) for an increase in BMI of 4.56kg/m2 and 1.32 
(1.24-1.40) for an increase in WC of 12.6cm. Our results also align with those of the recent 
study by the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration, which found a significantly higher risk of 
CHD death in both the overweight and obesity groups compared with the normal weight 
group in an analysis including 3,599,426 participants and 54,872 CHD deaths (1). Although 
substantially attenuated, an independent effect of BMI and WC remained after adjustment 
for major potential mediators (SBP, cholesterol, diabetes), indicating that the excess risk for

 CHD due to high BMI or WC is at least partially mediated by other factors. This is 
consistent with a pooled analysis of 97 prospective cohort studies from the Prospective 
Studies Collaboration (57,161 CHD cases), which estimated that these three factors 
collectively explained 46% of the excess risk due to adiposity (4). The association between 
adiposity and CHD has been suggested to be causal by Mendelian randomization studies, 
which have shown that genetic scores indexing BMI or waist-to-hip ratio are associated with 
risk of CHD (59–61). Similar studies have shown causal associations of adiposity with 
cardiovascular risk factors, supporting the hypothesis of mediation by blood pressure and 
cholesterol (62).
Our study had various strengths, including its prospective design and its large sample size, 
allowing assessment of risk in various subgroups. Anthropometric factors were mostly 
measured by trained health professionals, which should reduce measurement error, and 
concomitant measurement of weight, height and waist circumference allowed direct 
comparison of BMI and WC in the same participants. The biomarkers measured and 
information on medical history permitted exploration of various commonly used definitions 
of metabolic syndrome, and the extensive information on covariates (smoking, physical 
activity, diet quality, alcohol, education) allowed adjustment for a range of potential 
confounders. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of unmeasured confounding. In 
particular, as behaviors like physical activity and diet are self-reported at a single time point 
and were therefore prone to measurement error (28, 63), it is likely that they were not fully 
captured.
Study limitations
A potential limitation when comparing our results with previous studies is the lack of 
consistency in the definition of metabolically healthy obesity (38, 64). Moreover, by 
definition, the MetS gives a simplified picture of diverse and complex phenotypes. To 
overcome this limitation, we chose the most common definition (14, 15, 17) (absence of the 
MetS (5)), and compared several alternative definitions in sensitivity analyses, all of which 
gave qualitatively similar results. The absence of repeated assessment of metabolic health or 
adiposity during follow-up meant we were unable to assess within-person variability in 
adiposity and shed light on the proportion of metabolically healthy obese individuals who 
became metabolically unhealthy, preventing analyses of “stable metabolically healthy 
obesity” and “transient metabolically healthy obesity”. Finally, we acknowledge that some 
of the centres included in the EPIC study are not representative of the general population, 
potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. For example, the prevalence of 
metabolically healthy obesity within obese participants (45%) in EPIC-CVD is higher than 
in some other population-based studies (64), suggesting that EPIC participants are likely to 
be healthier than the general population. However, even if the participants are different from 
the general population, as long as there is enough variability in the exposure (here, obesity 
and metabolic health markers), CHD risk estimates and generalizability of the associations 
are unlikely to be affected.

 Conclusions
In this large pan-European study, overweight and obesity were associated with higher risk of 
CHD, even in the absence of metabolic syndrome. The presence of metabolic abnormalities 
was associated with a higher risk of CHD at all levels of adiposity, including in normal 
weight individuals. Overweight and obese individuals without metabolic dysfunction were at 
intermediate risk of CHD between healthy normal weight and metabolically unhealthy 
individuals. Our results highlight the importance of both obesity and metabolic health in 
CHD prevention and do not support the concept of “metabolically healthy obesity”. 
Population-wide prevention and treatment of obesity is therefore warranted, regardless of 
metabolic health.

Country-specific HRs were estimated from Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards 
models, and 95%CI estimated with robust variance, to take into account the case-cohort 
design. HRs were combined by multivariate random-effects meta-analysis across 8 countries 
and accompanied by a group-specific confidence interval (allowing a confidence interval to 
be attributed to the reference category). Age was used as the primary time variable, and 
analyses were stratified by sex and centre. n=17,733 (7,637 cases)
Model 1 (a and d). Adjusted for age, smoking, physical activity, Mediterranean diet score, 
energy and alcohol intake, educational level
Model 2. Model 1 + adjusted for WC (for BMI, b) or BMI (for WC, e)
Model 3 (c and f). Adjusted for age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total 
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, history of diabetes
Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; WC, waist circumference, CHD, coronary heart 
disease

 Figure 3. Multivariate hazard ratios of CHD in metabolically-defined body size phenotypes.
a Country-specific HRs of CHD were estimated from Prentice-weighted Cox proportional 
hazards models, and 95%CI estimated with robust variance, to take into account the case-
cohort design. HRs were combined by multivariate random-effects meta-analysis across 8 
countries. Age was used as the underlying time scale, models were stratified by sex and 
centre, adjusted for age, smoking, educational level, physical activity, Mediterranean diet 
score, energy and alcohol intake (Model B). n=17,733 participants (7,637 CHD cases). P for 
interaction between BMI and MetS = 0.19.
