 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
recommends annual influenza vaccination for all health care 
personnel to reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality 
among both health care personnel and their patients (1–4). 
To estimate influenza vaccination coverage among U.S. health 
care personnel for the 2015–16 influenza season, CDC con-
ducted an opt-in Internet panel survey of 2,258 health care 
personnel during March 28–April 14, 2016. Overall, 79.0% 
of survey participants reported receiving an influenza vaccina-
tion during the 2015–16 season, similar to the 77.3% coverage 
reported for the 2014–15 season (5). Coverage in long-term 
care settings increased by 5.3 percentage points compared 
with the previous season. Vaccination coverage continued to 
be higher among health care personnel working in hospitals 
(91.2%) and lower among health care personnel working in 
ambulatory (79.8%) and long-term care settings (69.2%). 
Coverage continued to be highest among physicians (95.6%) 
and lowest among assistants and aides (64.1%), and highest 
overall among health care personnel who were required by 
their employer to be vaccinated (96.5%). Among health care 
personnel working in settings where vaccination was neither 
required, promoted, nor offered onsite, vaccination coverage 
continued to be low (44.9%). An increased percentage of health 
care personnel reporting a vaccination requirement or onsite 
vaccination availability compared with earlier influenza seasons 
might have contributed to the overall increase in vaccination 
coverage during the past 6 influenza seasons.
The Internet panel survey was conducted for CDC by 
Abt Associates, Inc. (Cambridge, Massachusetts) during 
March 28–April 14, 2016, to provide estimates of influenza 
vaccination coverage among health care personnel during the 
2015–16 influenza season. Similar surveys have been conducted 
since the 2010–11 influenza season, and survey methodology 
has been reported previously (5). Health care personnel were 
recruited from two preexisting national opt-in Internet sources: 
Medscape, a medical website managed by WebMD Health 
Professional Network,* and general population Internet panels 
operated by Survey Sampling International (SSI).† Responses 
were weighted to the distribution of the U.S. population of 
health care personnel by occupation, age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
work setting, and Census region.§ Because the study sample was 
based on health care personnel from opt-in Internet panels rather 
than probability samples, no statistical tests were performed (6). 
A change was considered as an increase or decrease when there 
was at least a 5-percentage point difference between estimates; 
estimates with smaller differences were considered similar.
Among the 2,396 health care personnel who started the 
survey from either source (Medscape or SSI) and had eligible 
responses to the screening questions, 2,316 (96.7%) completed 
the survey.¶ Fifty-seven respondents with completed surveys 
who reported working in “other health care settings” were 
excluded because examination of their other survey responses 
indicated that they were either unlikely to have contact with 
patients or that their work setting was not one of the health 
care settings of interest for this analysis, and one respondent 
was excluded because vaccination status was unknown, leaving 
a final analytic sample of 2,258 health care personnel.
Overall, 79.0% of respondents reported having received an 
influenza vaccination during the 2015–16 season, an increase 
of 15.5 percentage points compared with the 2010–11 season 
estimate, but similar to the 77.3% coverage estimate reported 
in the 2014–15 season (Figure) (Table 1). Coverage continued 
to be highest among physicians (95.6%) and lowest among 
assistants and aides (64.1%) (Figure). Among vaccinated health 
care personnel, 72.7% were vaccinated at their workplace.
* Physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, dentists, 
pharmacists, allied health professionals, technicians, and technologists) were 
recruited from the current membership roster of Medscape. Additional 
information on Medscape is available at http://www.medscape.com.
† Assistants, aides, and nonclinical personnel (such as administrators, clerical 
support workers, janitors, food service workers, and housekeepers) were recruited 
from general population Internet panels operated by Survey Sampling 
International. Additional information on Survey Sampling International and 
its incentives for online survey participants is available at https://www.
surveysampling.com.
§ Population control totals of U.S. health care personnel by occupation and work 
setting were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of 
Labor, Occupational Employment Statistics, May 2014 National Industry-
specific Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates (http://www.bls.gov/
oes/current/oessrci.htm). Population control totals by other demographic 
characteristics were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population 
Survey Monthly Labor Force Data, September 2015 (http://www.census.gov/
programs-surveys/cps/data-detail.html).
¶ A survey response rate requires specification of the denominator at each stage 
of sampling. During recruitment of an online opt-in survey sample, such as 
the Internet panels described in this report, these numbers are not available; 
therefore, a response rate cannot be calculated. Instead, the survey cooperation 
rate is provided.

Coverage among health care personnel work-
ing in long-term care settings increased from 
63.9% in the 2014–15 season to 69.2% in the 
2015–16 season; for all other work settings, 
coverage in the 2015–16 season was similar 
to coverage in the 2014–15 season (Figure) 
(Table 1). Although influenza vaccination cov-
erage has increased in all work settings since the 
2011–12 season, health care providers in long-
term care settings have consistently had lower 
coverage than health care personnel working in 
hospital and ambulatory care settings (Figure).
During the 2015–16 influenza season, vac-
cination coverage was 96.5% among health 
care personnel working in settings where 
vaccination was required (Table 2). Overall, 
37.8% of surveyed health care personnel were 
required to be vaccinated against influenza, 
similar to the percentages in the 2013–14 
and 2014–15 seasons. Sixty-one percent of 
health care personnel working in hospitals 
had requirements for influenza vaccination, 
which is at least 27 percentage points more 
than the proportion in any other work set-
ting. By occupation, physicians (51.0%), 
nurses (49.8%), and other clinical personnel 
(47.4%) reported the highest prevalences of 
influenza vaccination requirements in the 
2015–16 season, and assistants and aides 
reported the lowest requirement prevalence of 
influenza vaccination requirements (22.5%, 
data not shown).
Among health care personnel whose 
employers did not have a requirement for 
vaccination, coverage was higher among 
personnel who worked in locations where 
vaccination was available at the worksite 
at no cost for >1 day (82.8%) or 1 day 
(82.1%) than among personnel who 
worked in locations where their employer 
did not provide influenza vaccination 
onsite at no cost but actively promoted 
vaccination through other mechanisms** 
(67.8%). Vaccination coverage was lowest (44.9%) among 
health care personnel working in locations where employers 
neither required vaccination, provided vaccination onsite 
at no cost, nor promoted vaccination (Table 2). Health 
care personnel working in ambulatory, long-term care, 
and other clinical settings more frequently reported that 
their employer neither required, provided, nor promoted

The overall estimate of influenza vaccination coverage among 
health care personnel during the 2015–16 season was 79.0%, 
similar to the previous two influenza seasons. The percentage

percentage of employees receiving vaccination, or making vaccination available at special events organized on site. Restricted to respondents without an employer 
requirement for vaccination or on-site vaccination.

substantially since the 2013–14 season. As in previous influ-
enza seasons, higher influenza vaccination coverage among 
health care personnel was associated with employer vaccination 
requirements and with access to vaccination at the workplace at 
no cost (5), highlighting the value of vaccination requirements 
and access to influenza vaccination at the worksite as effective 
tools for increasing overall coverage.
Coverage among health care personnel working in long-term 
care settings increased compared with the 2014–15 season, and 
has increased by approximately 17 percentage points since the 
2011–12 influenza season. Although low, this is the only set-
ting with an appreciable increase in coverage compared with 
last season. Influenza vaccination among health care person-
nel in long-term care settings is especially important because 
influenza vaccine effectiveness is generally lowest in the elderly 
(3). In addition, multiple studies have demonstrated that vac-
cination of health care personnel in long-term care settings 
confers a health benefit to patients, including reduced risk for 
mortality (2–4). Health care personnel working in long-term 
care settings consistently are the least likely to report that their 
employer either required or promoted vaccination, or made 
vaccination available onsite at no cost.
Implementing strategies shown to improve vaccination 
coverage among health care personnel in a workplace, includ-
ing vaccination requirements or offering onsite vaccinations 
at no cost over multiple days, can help protect long-term care 
patients from influenza (7). Employers can use the long-term 
care web-based toolkit†† developed by CDC and the National 
Vaccine Program Office to access resources, strategies, and edu-
cational materials for increasing influenza vaccination among 
health care personnel in long-term care settings.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, the study used a nonprobability sample of 
volunteer health care personnel members of Medscape and SSI 
Internet panels. Second, vaccination status was self-reported 
and might be subject to recall bias. Finally, coverage findings 
from Internet survey panels have differed from population-
based estimates from the National Health Interview Survey 
in past influenza seasons (8,9). These limitations might affect 
the representativeness of these findings to the U.S. population 
of health care personnel (10).
The highest influenza vaccination coverage among health 
care personnel continues to be reported in worksites with 
employer requirements for vaccination. Health care person-
nel working in long-term care settings had the largest increase 
in vaccination coverage; despite these increases, this group 
continues to have the lowest levels of coverage. Employer 
vaccination requirements likely contributed to the observed 
gradual increase in vaccination among health care personnel 
working in settings with the lowest coverage. In the absence of 
vaccination requirements, expanding the number of health care 
locations offering vaccination onsite, over multiple days, and at 
no cost might help sustain and improve influenza vaccination 
coverage among health care personnel, including in long-term 
care settings. Employers and health care administrators can 
make use of the Guide to Community Preventive Services, which 
presents evidence to support onsite vaccination at no or low 
cost to health care personnel to increase influenza vaccination 
coverage among health care personnel (7).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recom-
mends annual influenza vaccination for all health care person-
nel to reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality in 
health care settings. For the 2014–15 influenza season, the 
estimated overall influenza vaccination coverage among health 
care personnel was 77.3%.
What is added by this report?
Influenza vaccination coverage among health care personnel 
during the 2015–16 influenza season, assessed using an opt-in 
Internet panel survey, was 79.0%, similar to coverage during the 
2014–15 season. Coverage was highest among physicians, 
nurse practitioners/physician assistants, nurses, pharmacists, 
and health care personnel working in hospital settings. 
Coverage was lowest among assistants and aides and personnel 
working in long-term care settings. Employer vaccination 
requirements and offering vaccination at the workplace at no 
cost were associated with higher vaccination coverage.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Employer vaccination requirements, offering influenza vaccina-
tion onsite at no cost, or both can achieve high health care 
personnel vaccination coverage. Implementing comprehensive 
evidence-based worksite intervention strategies will be 
important to ensure health care personnel and patients are 
protected against influenza.
