Borrelia burgdorferi sl is a complex of pathogen bacteria transmitted to the host by Ixodes
ticks. European Ixodes ricinus ticks transmit different B. burgdorferi species, pathogenic
to human. Bacteria are principally present in unfed tick midgut, then migrate to salivary
glands during blood meal and infect a new host via saliva. In this study, efficiency of
transmission in a mouse model of three pathogen species belonging to the B. burgdorferi
sl complex, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (B31, N40, and BRE-13), B. afzelii (IBS-5), and
B. bavariensis (PBi) is examined in order to evaluate infection risk after tick bite. We
compared the dissemination of the Borrelia species in mice after tick bite and needle
injection. Location in the ticks and transmission to mice were also determined for the
three species by following infection kinetics. After inoculation, we found a significant
prevalence in the brain for PBi and BRE-13, in the heart, for PBi, in the skin where
B31 was more prevalent than PBi and in the ankle where both B31 and N40 were
more present than PBi. After tick bite, statistical analyses showed that BRE-13 was
more prevalent than N40 in the brain, in the bladder and in the inguinal lymph node.
When Borrelia dissemination was compared after inoculation and tick bite, we observed
heart infection only after tick inoculation of BRE-13, and PBi was only detected after
tick bite in the skin. For N40, a higher number of positive organs was found after
inoculation compared to tick bite. All European B. burgdorferi sl strains studied were
detected in female salivary glands before blood meal and infected mice within 24 h of
tick bite. Moreover, Borrelia-infected nymphs were able to infect mice as early as 12 h
of tick attachment. Our study shows the need to remove ticks as early as possible after
attachment. Moreover, Borrelia tropism varied according to the strain as well as between
ticks bite and needle inoculation, confirming the association between some strains and
clinical manifestation of Lyme borreliosis, as well as the role played by tick saliva in the
efficiency of Borrelia infection and dissemination in vertebrates.

Tropism and Transmission Kinetics of B. burgdorferi
INTRODUCTION
Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most commonly occurring vector-
borne disease in Europe. It is caused by spirochetes belonging
to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) complex. This
complex comprises species: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss),
B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. bavariensis, B. spielmanii, B. valaisiana
and B. lusitaniae (Rijpkema et al., 1997; Collares-Pereira et al.,
2004; Rudenko et al., 2011; Stanek et al., 2011). The bacteria
are transmitted by a hard tick bite of Ixodes genus. Ticks can
parasitize a wide range of hosts. Some of them may be reservoirs
for Borrelia, humans being considered as accidental hosts.
In Europe, nearly 85,000 cases are reported each year,
an underestimated figure due to the many undeclared or
undiagnosed cases. The highest number of cases is reported in
Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and the Balkans
(Lindgren and Jaenson, 2006). In France, the LB incidence rate is
around 42 per 100,000 inhabitants (Vandenesch et al., 2014). LB is
contracted by both forest professionals and recreational visitors.
Lyme borreliosis (LB) can affect a wide range of tissues
including skin, the nervous system, joints, heart, and less
frequently other organs (Stanek and Reiter, 2011). The most
common presenting symptom is erythema migrans, a typical skin
lesion that generally appears within 3–30 days subsequently to the
infectious tick bite. Days to weeks after infection, B. burgdorferi
disseminates through the bloodstream and/or lymphatic system
to invade and colonize various tissues, such as the synovial fluid
of joints, the heart and the nervous system. Neuroborreliosis is
the most common manifestation in Europe and is due to the
geographic spread of B. garinii (Stanek and Reiter, 2011; Koedel
et al., 2015). Arthritis, a late manifestation targeting large joints,
is commonly reported in North America, where B. burgdorferi ss
species are dominant. Cardiac manifestations have been reported
during both the acute phase and the chronic stage, but is rare
(<5%). Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is associated with
Borrelia afzelii (Coipan et al., 2016).
The epidemiological chain of LB comprises three links: natural
reservoirs (small mammals, birds), the vector and animal species
known to amplify the tick cycle (large mammals). In Europe, the
vector of B. burgdorferi sl is the hard tick Ixodes ricinus. This tick
is present especially in humid and forest areas. It is a mandatory
bloodsucking parasite, with a development cycle implying three
stages (larva, nymph, adult) interspersed with bloodmeals and
molts.
I. ricinus is able to feed on more than 240 different species.
Reservoirs provide both host and prolonged survival of the
pathogen, which increases the likelihood that a tick contracts the
bacteria from gorging on the host (Skotarczak, 2009). For most
tick-borne pathogens, transmission to the vertebrate host occurs
during a blood meal via the saliva of the vector. Both salivary
glands and saliva play an important role in the transmission
process. Tick saliva contains a large variety of components able
to counteract host haemostasis and play a role on the tuning
of host immune responses (Šimo et al., 2017). Enhancement
of pathogen transmission by tick saliva has been reported for
several tick-pathogen associations (Labuda and Nuttall, 2004).
Interestingly, the mode of inoculation of B. burgdorferi sl was
shown to influence infection in inbred strains of mouse (Gern
et al., 1993).
Humans are considered accidental hosts and transmission can
occur when in contact with a vector-adapted environment, where
vertebrate hosts and their associated ticks are present, or when
animals transport ticks into areas of human dwelling. It is usually
specified in health agency guidelines that the risk of LB rises with
duration of attachment of the tick. In the same way, it is regularly
specified that the danger of transmission is very low or absent if
the tick is removed within 24–48 h (Eisen, 2018).
In this study, we were interested in defining kinetics of mouse
infection by ticks (nymphs and adults) infected by different
Borrelia strains or species. We also compared the dissemination
of various Borrelia strains and species in mice infected by various
modes of inoculation (via infected ticks or by needle injection).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Specific-pathogen-free mice C3H/HeN (5–7-week-old females)
were purchased from Janvier (St Berthevin, France). Mice were
housed in the Institut Pasteur’s Animal facilities, accredited by
the French Ministry of Agriculture to perform experiments on
live mice, in appliance with the French and European regulations
on care and protection of Laboratory animals. The protocol of
our experiments was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee
of Pasteur Institute (CETEA-Institut Pasteur) and by the French
Ministry of Higher Education and Research (MESR 00762.02).
Bacterial Strains
Table 1 listed the B. burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) strains used
in this study. They were all cultivated in BSK medium
(Sigma) at 33◦C. The number and motility of spirochetes were
determined by dark-field microscopy with a Petroff Hausser
counting chamber (Hausser scientific). The presence of ospC
was verified by PCR using the following primers: forward
BRE-13, B31 and N40: AAAAAAAAGGATCCGGAAAAGATG
GGAATGC; forward PBi: AAAAAAAAGGATCCGGTGGGG
ATTCTGCATC; forward IBS-5: AAAAAAAAGGATCCGGGA
AAGGTGGGTC; reverse for all strains and species: AAAAAA
AACTCGAGCTAAGGTTTTTTTGGACTTCT TGC.
Infection of Ticks
I. ricinus nymphs and larvae were obtained from the pathogen-
free breeding colony at the UMR BioEpAR (Oniris, France).
Ticks were reared and maintained in chambers with a relative
humidity of 80–90% at room temperature before feeding.
Each cohort (200 ticks) was controlled for the absence of
B. burgdorferi sl DNA by PCR.
To obtain infected nymphs or adults, larvae and nymphs
were allowed to feed on infected mice until repletion 14–28 days
after mouse infection, depending on the result of ear biopsies
(Figure 1). For each strain, 2 series of 40 larvae or 20 nymphs
were allowed to feed per mouse at 1 week interval. Replete
ticks were maintained at 20◦C and 95% relative humidity and
used about 2 months after they molted into potentially infected
nymphs and adults. Tick infection rates were evaluated by DNA

FIGURE 1 | Data acquisition workflow. (A) Mice were infected by subcutaneous inoculation of 105 bacteria. Their infection status was controlled by PCR after ear
biopsy. Borrelia-positive mice were either used for infecting larvae or nymphs (B,C respectively) or dissected 38 days after infection; B and C. Borrelia-negative larvae
or nymphs were fed on Borrelia-positive mice. After molting, their rate of infection was determined; (D) Ten Borrelia-exposed nymphs or 3 Borrelia-exposed females
were fed on Borrelia-negative mice. The kinetics of infection of their salivary glands was determined after different duration of tick attachment; (E) Mice exposed to the

adults depending on the Borrelia strain.
Infection of Mice With B. burgdorferi sl
1. Infection of mice by subcutaneous inoculation (Figure 1A).
For each strain, ten mice were subcutaneously inoculated with
0.1 ml of the culture material (105 spirochetes). Mice from the
control group were injected at the same time with an equal
volume of BSK medium.
2. Infection of mice by infected tick-bite (Figures 1B,C). The
nymphs and females that were used in all these experiments
were fed on Borrelia-infected mice at the preceding stage. The
back of mice was shaved and a hollow plastic cap was glued
with wax (Mbow et al., 1994). Ticks were placed in the plastic

cap that is closed by a plaster. They were observed twice a
day.
- Tropism of the various Borrelia strains inoculated by tick
bites (comparison with needle inoculation of the various
strains). Three females were placed in the plastic cap. Five
to seven mice were infected up to 5 days [120 h] of female
tick attachment.
- Kinetics of infection of tick salivary glands and of
transmission of the different strains after infected tick bite
(Figures 1D,E). It was analyzed using ten nymphs or 2–3
females that were allowed to feed on 3 healthy mice for each
time of the kinetics. Experiments were repeated 2 or 3 times.
The duration of infection was controlled by removing ticks
at 12, 24, and 36 h of feeding for nymphs, and at 24, 72, 120
and repletion for adults. The presence of spirochetes in tick
salivary glands and in tick organs was analyzed by PCR.
3. Detection of Borrelia in mice infected by inoculation or
tick bite (Figures 1A,E). To determine Borrelia infection
in mice, ear biopsies were collected each 7 days after 2
weeks of infection until Borrelia DNA detection. After 38
days of B. burgdorferi sl inoculation or tick bite infection
(the timing started as soon as the tick was attached), mice
were dissected and spirochete DNA presence was investigated
from different organs (brain, heart, back skin, ankle, bladder,
muscle, spleen, liver, mesentery and inguinal lymph nodes),
collected aseptically.
Dissections
Tick dissections were performed under microscope in sterile PBS.
All dissection materials were cleaned with alcohol 70% and rinsed
with sterile water between each sample. Individual pairs of tick
salivary glands, the remaining tick carcasses and all organs from
mice were analyzed immediately or frozen at −80◦C until DNA
extraction.
B. burgdorferi sl DNA Detection in Ticks
and Mice
DNA extraction from ticks or mice was performed using the
DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The
purified DNA was eluted with sterile water in 20 µl for salivary
gland, 50 µl for nymph carcasses, 100 µl for adult carcasses and
between 100 and 200 µl for each mouse organ.
A nested PCR was performed on each sample to amplify the
variable spacer region between two tandemly duplicated genes
encoding for ribosomal 23 and 5S. The first set of primers used
was Ins1 (5’-GAAAAGAGGAAACACCTGTT-3’) and S23R (5′-
TCGGTAATCTTGGGATCAAT-3′) which amplified a 360-bp
fragment. The second amplification was performed with RRC (5′-
CTGCGAGTTCGCGGGAGAG-3′) and RRB (5′-AAGCTCCTA
GGCATTCACCATA-3′) primers resulting in a 257-bp fragment
(Schwartz et al., 1992).
For each PCR, 5 µl of DNA from the extract or from the
first amplification were used. The PCR cycles were carried out
with an initial denaturation step for 4 min at 94◦C; 35 cycles of
denaturation for 1 min at 94◦C, annealing for 1 min at 55◦C for
Ins1-S23R and 59◦C for RRB’-RRC’
, and extension for 1 min at
72◦C; and a final extension step at 72◦C for 10 min.
Each reaction was conducted in a total volume of 25 µl with
0.3 µmol/µl of each primer, 200 µmol/L of each dNTP, 2.5 µl of
10× PCR buffer, and 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Taq CORE
Kits, Q-biogene). All PCRs were performed in a thermocycler My
cycler (Bio-Rad, France). Positive control (B. burgdorferi sl strain
different from the strain used for infection) and negative control
(PCR mix) were used in each PCR.
PCR products were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel with
ethidium bromide and visualized with a Gel DocTM XR (Bio-
Rad).
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were done in Simstat (Provalis Research)
using the non-parametric tests Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-
Whitney, taking into account the Bonferroni correction.
RESULTS
Infection of Mice After B. burgdorferi sl
Needle Inoculation
All DNA extraction from ear biopsies of mice infected
by B. burgdorferi ss B31 strain allowed identification of
B. burgdorferi sl DNA after 21 days of infection. For B. burgdorferi
ss BRE-13 strain, Borrelia DNA was detected in ear biopsies from
20% of mice after 14 days and 70% of mice after 21 days. 90%
of mice were found positive by specific DNA amplification 14
days after inoculation of the B. burgdorferi ss N40 strain. DNA
B. burgdorferi sl was detected in the ears of mice infected with
B. bavariensis PBi strain after 3 weeks in 60% of them and in 80%
of mice after 28 days. Borrelia DNA was amplified in 40% of mice
2 weeks after B. afzelii IBS-5 inoculation and 80% of them were
positive 1 week later. Thirty eight days after needle inoculation,
all mice were found positive for all Borrelia strains.
For the 5 strains, ten organs were studied in order to detect
B. burgdorferi sl infection by nested PCR (Table 2, Figure 2).
If we consider the three strains of B. burgdorferi ss, B31, BRE-
13 and N40, specific bacterial amplification was obtained from
bladder, back skin and ankle. No B. burgdorferi sl DNA was
detected in brain 38 days after inoculation of B31 and N40 strains.
BRE-13 strain was the only one for which DNA amplification
was observed in the brain while B31 was the only strain of
B. burgdorferi ss to be found in the heart.
After inoculation with B. bavariensis PBi strain, bacterial DNA
amplification was obtained from bladders, brains and hearts. No
bacterial DNA was amplified from back skins and ankles.
Specific DNA was amplified after B. afzelii IBS-5 inoculation
from hearts, brains, back skins, ankles and bladders.
We then compared the tropism of the various B. burgdorferi sl
strains after injection. Difference of prevalence was observed in
various organs: brain, heart, back skin and ankle. As described
above, the three B. burgdorferi ss strains did not give similar
results. B31 and N40 were never present in the brain at the
difference of BRE-13 and PBi (p = 0.0003). BRE-13 and N40 were
not identified in the heart at the difference of PBi (p = 0.0002).
B31 and N40 were more prevalent in the ankle than PBi

Mice were infected with the various strains/species of Borrelia burgdorferi sl either by needle injection of 105 Borrelia/mouse or by tick bite during 120 h (see Figure 1). Mice were dissected 38 days after beginning of tick attachment.
DNA was extracted as described in the Material and Methods section and a specific nested PCR was performed. The percent of organs found infected in the mice analyzed was reported according to the type of infection (inoculation/tick
bite). 5–7 mice were used for each experiment. Statistical comparisons of organ infection between Borrelia strain after infection (inoculation or tick bite) are presented in bold:*BRE-13 = PBi > B31 = N40; §PBi > BRE-13 = N40;

B. burgdorferi sl Infection in I. ricinus Ticks
After Infection on Needle-Infected Mice
A total of 2,400 nymphs and about 1,500 larvae were used to
obtain infected ticks.
On 400 nymphs used for each strain, 224 (56%), 284 (71%),
315 (79%), 233 (58%), and 270 (68%) were engorged and
spontaneously detached from mice infected respectively with
B. burgdorferi ss B31, BRE-13, and N40, B. bavariensis PBi and
B. afzelii IBS-5 strains. After 3 months, respectively 145 (65%),
247 (87%), 255 (81%), 116 (50%), and 261 (97%) nymphs molted
into adults from which 79, 93, 120, 45, and 109 females were
obtained for each strain.
Female infection rates of the 3 B. burgdorferi ss strains reached
70% for B31 (16/23), 78% (28/36) for N40 and 96% for BRE-
13 (27/28), the latter strain having the highest rate of infection
of the B. burgdorferi ss strains (p = 0.008). Infection rates in
females were 70% (23/33) for B. bavariensis PBi and 70% (21/30)
for B. afzelii IBS-5. When all strains were compared, their rate of
infection was similar.
Concerning larvae, 338, 360, and 390 of them were engorged
from mice infected respectively with B. burgdorferi ss BRE-13,
B. bavariensis PBi and B. afzelii IBS-5 strains. After 3 months,
respectively 59, 60, and 61% of BRE-13, B. bavariensis PBi
and B. afzelii IBS-5 engorged larvae molted into nymphs. The
infection rates in nymphs were 90% (27/30) for B. burgdorferi ss
BRE-13, 70% (21/30) for B. bavariensis PBi and 77% (23/30) for
B. afzelii IBS-5.
B. burgdorferi sl Tropism in Mice After
Infected Tick Bite: Comparison With
Needle Injection
Mice were infected by ticks that were removed at 120 h of tick
attachment. They were sacrificed at 38 days post-infection and
their organs dissected. Borrelia DNA was detected after nested
PCR. The percent of positive organs as function of the strain is
reported in Table 2.
After tick bite infection with B. burgdorferi ss B31 and BRE-
13 strain, all organs presented bacterial DNA amplification with
various infection rates while in N40-infected mice, only ankles
and back skin were found infected. After bite of B. bavariensis PBi
infected ticks, bacterial DNA amplification was obtained from
all organs except heart and mesentery. B. burgdorferi DNA was
amplified after bite of B. afzelii IBS-5 infected females from all
tested organs.
When the prevalence of all strains were compared in each
organ, statistical analyses showed that B. burgdorferi ss BRE-
13 was more prevalent than B. burgdorferi ss N40 in the brain
(p < 0.018), in the bladder (p < 0.016) and in the inguinal lymph
node (p < 0.017) after tick bite.

Tropism and Transmission Kinetics of B. burgdorferi
We compared the dissemination of each strain in the various
organs after inoculation or tick bite. We observed the infection
of the heart after tick inoculation of B. burgdorferi ss BRE-13
whereas this organ was found uninfected after inoculation. The
same trend was also observed for B. bavariensis PBi for which an
infection of the back skin was only detected after tick bite. For
the other comparisons, more organs were found infected after
inoculation than after tick bite. For instance, a higher number
of positive organs was statistically found after inoculation of
B. burgdorferi ss N40 compared with tick bite.
Adult Tick Infection Kinetics of Salivary
Glands and Mice by B. Burgdorferi sl After
Female Tick Bite
All results of B. burgdorferi sl DNA detection in female salivary
glands and corresponding mice are reported in Table 3. Mouse
infection was detected 38 days after removing infected female
ticks.
Concerning B. burgdorferi ss B31 infected ticks, salivary
gland extract DNA showed no Borrelia amplification for tick
attachment of 24 h. But after 120 h of female feeding, the specific
DNA fragment was amplified from 67% of the salivary glands
tested. 100% of the mice were found infected for tick attachment
of 120 h.
The B. burgdorferi ss N40 strain was detected in tick salivary
glands collected at 24 h of tick fixation with bacterial DNA
amplification from 50% of female salivary glands. At respectively
72 and 120 h of tick attachment, 100 and 83% of salivary glands
showed B. burgdorferi sl DNA amplification. Furthermore, 100%
of mice became infected by N40 strain up to 24 h of tick
attachment as well as up to 72 and 120 h of tick bite.
Concerning the 3 other strains, B. burgdorferi ss BRE-13,
B. bavariensis PBi and B. afzelii IBS-5, B. burgdorferi sl DNA
was amplified from 100% of female salivary glands infected at
the preceding stage prior to their fixation on mice. From 24 h
to repletion, the rate of infection of tick salivary glands with the
three different strains was shown to vary depending on the time
(Table 3).
When ticks were removed at 24 h of tick attachment,
B. burgdorferi sl DNA was detected in mice for the three strains:
100 % was infected by B. burgdorferi ss BRE-13, B. bavariensis
PBi and B. afzelii IBS-5. This rate of infection was constant after
bite of B. burgdorferi ss BRE-13 and B. afzelii IBS-5 whatever tick
attachment time, whereas a slight decrease was observed at 120 h
of tick attachment for B. bavariensis PBi (Table 3).
We then tested the tropism of the various strains as function
of the time of attachment of infected ticks (Table 4). Again,
significant differences were found between the various strains of
B. burgdorferi ss. BRE-13 was the one for which all organs tested
except the heart was found infected after 24 h of tick attachment,
whereas only the skin and ankle were found infected by N40 and
none by B31. Ankles were found positive for all strains except B31
while only BRE-13 and PBi were found in the bladder and in the
lymph nodes. The tropism of IBS-5 and N40 was similar.
After removing the ticks at 72 h, PBi was found in all organs
except the lymph node and the heart, this latter was never
infected by this strain whatever the time of attachment. PBi was
found in the brain at 72 h of tick attachment and was still detected
at 120 h but not any more after repletion of the tick. The bladder
was found positive for all strains except N40 after removing the
ticks at 120 h or after repletion. Interestingly, we found fewer
organs infected after repletion of the tick whatever the strain.
B. burgdorferi sl Infection Kinetics After
Nymph Bites
No B. burgdorferi sl DNA was amplified from nymph salivary
glands infected at the preceding stage prior to their fixation on
mice. Mice were found infected as soon as 12 h of attachment
of B. burgdorferi ss BRE-13, B. bavariensis PBi and B. afzelii
IBS-5 infected nymphs (Table 5). All organs except lymph node

Adult female ticks were infected on mice injected with different strains of Borrelia burgdorferi sl. Tick salivary glands were dissected before and after different times of attachment
on non-infected mice. Mice exposed to infected tick bites were dissected 38 days after infection. Their rate of infection was determined based on the detection Borrelia DNA in the
examined organs (see Figure 1). Two to three ticks were placed on the back of each mouse depending on the time of attachment. After this time, ticks were removed and their salivary
glands were dissected and the percentage of Borrelia-positive salivary glands was determined by nested PCR. Statistical comparison of salivary gland infection by the various strains:

DISCUSSION
Borrelia burgdorferi sl is transmitted to the host during Ixodes
ticks blood feeding. Several studies have shown the role that tick
saliva could play in tick feeding and pathogen transmission. The
minimal infected tick attachment time on a vertebrate host for
efficient transmission is still a matter of debate (Cook, 2015).
Indeed, it is frequently specified that the risk of infection is lower
if the tick is removed within 24–48 h (Piesman et al., 1987; des
Vignes et al., 2001). An increased risk of infection is observed
with longer tick attachment durations. Several studies showed
that a blood meal is able to trigger the downregulation of OspA/B
(involved in the colonization and survival of the tick midgut) and
the upregulation of OspC (involved in the dissemination from
the midgut to the salivary glands in the tick, and the interaction
with the vertebrate host) (Grimm et al., 2004; Stewart et al., 2006;
Fingerle et al., 2007; Kenedy et al., 2012). These processes are
suggested to prepare the bacteria for the infection of vertebrate
hosts.
However, data from the literature showed that transmission
can occur in less than 16 h (Hynote et al., 2012). In most unfed
ticks, spirochetes were shown to be present in the midgut and
need to migrate during blood feeding to the salivary glands, from
which they are transmitted to the host via saliva (Ribeiro et al.,
1987; Zung et al., 1989). However, disseminated infection was
observed in ticks before feeding (Piesman et al., 1987). Moreover,
there is evidence that Borrelia transmission and virulence depend
on tick and Borrelia species (Moskvitina et al., 1995a,b).
In the present study, the efficiency and the kinetics at which
Ixodes ricinus ticks are able to transmit B. afzelii, B. bavariensis
and several strains of B. burgdorferi ss to mice were examined
in relation to blood meal length. We also examined the tropism
of these various strains according to the transmission mode:
infected tick bite vs. needle inoculation.
B31 and N40 are two widely studied strains of B. burgdorferi
ss, which belong to two different 16 S-23 S rRNA spacer types and
outer surface protein C (OspC) allelic groups. They were both
isolated from Ixodes scapularis ticks, and both are very infectious
in the mouse model (Burgdorfer et al., 1982; Barthold et al.,
1988). Although phylogenetic analyses predicted B31 to be more
infectious, Chan et al. (Chan et al., 2012) indicated that N40
strain was more infectious at lower doses of inoculation. BRE-13
belongs to another group of OspC and was isolated from the CSF
of a patient with neurological symptoms (B. Degeilh, personal
communication).
Our observations showed that the two B. burgdorferi ss N40
and B31 strains were not present in unfed adult tick salivary
glands and that the transmission to mice was observed earlier
(24 h) for N40 and from 120 h after tick attachment for B31.
This was not what we observed for BRE-13, another strain
of B. burdorferi ss, for which unfed adult ticks had systemic
infections. We thus observed a strain-specific variation in the
tissue tropism in ticks. However, since we set the first infection
duration at 24 h, we were not able to see any difference in the
kinetics of infection in mouse between BRE-13 and N40.
B. afzelii IBS-5 and B. bavariensis PBi were also present in
unfed adult tick salivary glands, as was previously shown for
nymphs infected by B. garinii and B. afzelii (Kahl et al., 1998).
In agreement with this observation, mice were found infected as
early as 24 h of tick attachment.
For ticks with systemic infection, we did not find that
the risk of transmission increased with the contact duration
with host since all mice were found infected whatever the
duration of attachment. For strains like B31 and N40 that
were not found in salivary glands before feeding, we found

Ten Borrelia-exposed nymphs were placed in plastic caps on 3 mice for each strain. Nymphs were detached at the indicated time points. Mice were sacrificed 38 days post-infection

a difference in the kinetics of infection. B31 has not reached
the salivary glands at 24 h after tick attachment while N40 was
certainly present in this organ before 24 h and able to infect
the mice. We were also able to show that the dissemination
of the various strains differed according to the duration of
attachment. For instance, BRE-13 was isolated in several organs
except the heart after only 24 h of tick attachment, the heart
being found infected after 72 h of tick feeding. PBi was only
identified in the brain when removing the tick after 72 h but
not before. For IBS-5, all organs were found infected only at
120 h of tick attachment. These observations may suggest that
the symptomatology and thereby the severity of the infection
may be correlated to the duration of attachment, at least for
some strains, since BRE-13 seems virulent shortly after tick
attachment and N40 infects the same organs whatever the time
of feeding.
We also studied the infected nymph attachment duration to
obtain infected mice. We did not find any systemic infection
in B. burdorferi ss BRE-13, B. bavariensis PBi and Borrelia
afzelii IBS-5 infected nymphs. However, mice were infected when
nymphs were attached for less than 12 h. Again almost all organs
tested, including the brain and the heart are infected after 12 h of
BRE-13-infected nymph feeding, while PBi was only detected in
the ankle and in the lymph nodes and IBS-was identified in the
brain.
The ticks, vertebrate hosts and pathogens co-evolution has led
to the development of strategies to use salivary components in
order to guarantee both pathogen acquisition and transmission,
as well as local and disseminated infection in the host (Šimo
et al., 2017). Various studies have shown a higher efficiency in
Borrelia transmission in presence of saliva or saliva components
(Wikel, 2013). The salivary gland protein Salp15 plays an
immunosuppressive role and may thereby facilitate infection
by the low numbers of spirochetes that are released in the
skin during tick feeding (Anguita et al., 2002; Ramamoorthi
et al., 2005). A tick antioxidant was shown to facilitate tick
acquisition of spirochetes from infected animals (Narasimhan
et al., 2007). We were therefore interested in comparing the
various B. burgdorferi sl strains tropism after needle injection or
tick bite. In the murine model, mice can be infected by needle
inoculation or tick feeding (Tilly et al., 2008). Most mouse strains,
as well as the natural reservoir hosts, display no sign of disease,
but develop a serological response to B. burgdorferi proteins and
a persistent infection (Schwan et al., 1988; Barthold et al., 1990;
Wu et al., 2013).
After needle injection, we found a difference of tropism in
the brain, in the heart, in the back skin and in the ankle for the
different strains tested. B. burdorferi ss BRE-13 and B. bavariensis
PBi were detected in the brain of mice while B. burdorferi ss
B31 and N40 were never detected. The B. burgdorferi ss strains
that we used in this study were shown to present differential
tropism. They belong to different OspC groups (Table 1). OspC
is known to be involved in the early stages of mouse infection as
well as in dissemination (Kenedy et al., 2012). We can therefore
hypothesize that this could explain the altered dissemination
observed in the brain for B31 and N40 compared to BRE-13.
Interestingly, Wu et al. showed that B. burdorferi ss B31 infected
mouse brain but it was after intraperitoneal injection of the
spirochetes (Wu et al., 2013) suggesting that the intraperitoneal
vs. subcutaneous injection route may affect Borrelia bacteria
tropism. Moreover, the strain of the mice used in our studies are
not the same, Balb/C vs. C3H/HeN, this latter being the most
relevant animal model for Lyme borreliosis for discriminating
infectivity and pathogenicity of various B. burgdorferi strains
(Chan et al., 2012). However, in agreement with Wu et al. (2013)
we were also able to show that statistical differences existed
between the tropism of B31 and PBi (B. bavariensis but formerly
B. garinii) in the brain and in the heart.

the association between some clinical manifestations of LB and
the species of B. burgdorferi sl. Arthritis was shown to be
caused prevalently by B. burgdorferi ss, and neuroborreliosis
by B. burgdorferi ss and B. garinii/B. bavariensis (Balmelli and
Piffaretti, 1995).
All organs were found positive after feeding with ticks
infected with Borrelia burgdorferi ss B31 and BRE-13 and with
Borrelia afzelii IBS-5. Interestingly, all strains except N40 were
neurotropic after 120 h of tick feeding.
When we compared the tropism of the various Borrelia species
between tick bite and needle inoculation, it appears that most
of the time the percentage of positive organs was higher after
inoculation, except for B. burdorferi ss BRE-13 that was found
in the heart and for B. bavariensis PBi, which is detected in the
back skin only after tick bite. These two examples could illustrate

the role of tick saliva in Borrelia dissemination and tropism.
N40 was the strain for which the highest number of positive
organs was observed after needle injection while it was detected
in only two organs after tick bite: the back skin and the ankle.
These results suggest that the number of Borrelia injected by
needle (105) may exceed by far what is injected by the tick. When
Borrelia bacteria were quantified by Q-PCR in salivary glands of
Ixodes ricinus infected by different strains, their level was shown
to differ according to the strain (Cotté et al., 2014). The highest
level was found in B. burdorferi ss BRE-13-infected salivary
glands (106), while 104 bacteria were detected in B. burdorferi
ss B31 and B. bavariensis PBi infected glands, the lowest
amount, 103, being found in B. afzelii IBS-5 infected salivary
glands.
In conclusion, we showed that salivary glands of adult ticks
infected by the strains B. burdorferi ss BRE-13, B. burdorferi
ss PBi and B. afzelii IBS-5 are infected before feeding. The
spirochetes are thus present in the salivary glands, thereby
potentially able to be injected immediately after tick attachment
to host. One hundred percent of mice were found infected as
early as 24 h of tick attachment. Interestingly, in contradiction
with other studies, we did not report any increase in mice
infection rate depending on feeding time, while it is observed
for B. burdorferi ss B31. We also showed that even though the
salivary glands of unfed nymphs infected by B. burgdorferi ss
BRE-13 B. bavariensis PBi and B. afzelii IBS-5 are not infected,
Borrelia transmission was shown to occur as early as 12 h of
tick attachment. It is therefore important to remove nymphs
or adult ticks as soon as possible after bite to prevent any
transmission.
Borrelia bacteria tropism tested in this study was shown to
vary according to the strain as well as between ticks bite and
needle inoculation. These results confirm the association between
some strains and clinical manifestation of the LB, as well as the
role played by tick saliva in the efficiency of Borrelia bacterial
infection and dissemination in vertebrates.
