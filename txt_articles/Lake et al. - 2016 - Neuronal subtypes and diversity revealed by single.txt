The human brain has enormouslycomplexcellulardiversity and connectivities fundamental to our
neural functions, yet difficulties in interrogating individual neurons has impeded understanding
of the underlying transcriptional landscape. We developed a scalable approach to sequence
and quantify RNA molecules in isolated neuronal nuclei from a postmortem brain, generating
3227 sets of single-neuron data from six distinct regions of the cerebral cortex. Using an iterative
clustering and classification approach, we identified 16 neuronal subtypes that were further
annotated on the basis of known markers and cortical cytoarchitecture.These data demonstrate
a robust and scalable method for identifying and categorizing single nuclear transcriptomes,
revealing shared genes sufficient to distinguish previously unknown and orthologous neuronal
subtypes as well as regional identity and transcriptomic heterogeneity within the human brain.
A
lthough substantial progress has been
achieved in mice (1–3), comprehensive clas-
sification of adult human brain neurons on
the basis of their single-cell transcriptomes
has yet to be realized. Examination of in-
dividual neuronal gene expression profiles for
functional patterns could provide unbiased in-
sights into subtypes from defined neuroanatomical
regions, which are missed by gross anatomical
studies that report limited transcriptomic differ-
ences across the neocortex (4–7). Previous analyses
of single adult human neurons have been depen-
dent on methods compatible with freshly isolated
neurosurgical tissues (8), which can be difficult
to obtain, with limited regional sampling and
depth. In contrast, postmortem tissues provide a
vastly more accessible source of both normal and
diseased brain, in which challenges to interrogating
single neuronal genomes can be overcome by
using single nuclei (9, 10) combined with RNA
sequencing. Here, we report the development of a
scalable pipeline from postmortem brain through
nuclear transcriptome analyses that identifies
both known and previously unknown neuronal
subtypes across the cerebral cortex in humans.
With the goal of defining transcriptomic profiles
of single neurons, neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN)
was used (9) to isolate neuronal nuclei (fig. S1)
from the postmortem brain of a normal, 51-year-old
female (Fig. 1A). We focused on six classically
definedBrodmannAreas(BAs)withwell-documented
anatomical and electrophysiological properties that
were derived from a single cortical hemisphere be-
cause interhemispheric and interindividual tran-
scriptome differences were reported to be minimal
(4–7). Isolation of nuclei was used to reduce tran-
scriptomic contamination from other cells or
degradation encountered with whole-neuron dis-
sociation or laser caption microdissection (fig. S2).
Furthermore,sequencingofRNAfromsinglenuclei
on a limited scale has found gene expression values
comparable with that of the whole cell (11, 12).
Therefore, we developed and implemented a highly
scalable, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (SNS)
pipeline (13) (Fig. 1A and figs. S1 and S3 to S8) that
has broad applicability for postmortem brains
derived from multiple brain banks or repositories
(fig. S4F).
Using this pipeline, we processed 86 Fluidigm
C1 chips and sequenced 4488 single nuclei to an
average depth of 8.34 million reads (table S1 and
fig. S5). Genomic mapping rates revealed a high
proportion of reads that corresponded to intronic
sequences (Fig. 1A and fig. S5A). The low percent-
age of intergenic reads argues against possible
genomic contamination. Instead, the intronic reads
likely captured an abundance of nascent RNA
transcripts present in the nuclei. Intronic reads
can be used to predict de novo expression (14), as
well as whole-cell gene transcription levels (15).
Additionally, our single-nuclei expression data in-
clusive of intronic reads accurately predicted cel-
lular identity (fig. S7), providing initial validation
for our SNS pipeline.
After quality filtering, including removal of
doublets misclassified as single nuclei (Fig. 1A and
fig. S6) (13), we achieved 3227 data sets across the
sixcorticalregions (Fig.1Aandtable S2). Toidentify
neuronal subtypes, we developed a clustering and
classification strategy that was capable of resolving
17 clusters (fig. S8A) (13) on the basis of differential
expression of neuronally annotated marker genes
(tables S3 and S4 and fig. S8B). These clusters
showed distinct subgroup aggregation (Fig. 1B and
fig. S9A) and specific gene expression profiles asso-
ciated with neuronal ontologies (Fig. 1C, fig. S9B,
and tables S5 and S6). With the exception of a
single cluster (NoN, n = 44 data sets) deriving from
one C1 chip having reduced mapping rates, 16 of
these clusters were generated independent of de-
tectable batch effects (table S2 and fig. S10). Dif-
ferential expressionof inhibitory markers associated
with GABAergic interneurons (table S3) distin-
guished potential inhibitory (In) from excitatory
(Ex) neuronal subtypes (Fig. 1B), which is con-
sistent with mutually exclusive positivity of asso-
ciated marker genes using a fraction of positive
(FOP) thresholding method (Fig. 2A) (2). As such,
our data set first differentiated two major classifi-
cations within the cerebral cortex: 972 inhibitory

 neurons that generally encompass interneurons and
2253 excitatory neurons that generally encompass
pyramidalorprojectionneurons(16).Furthermore,
each subgroup within these classifications showed
distinct contributions from each brain region
(Fig. 2A and table S7), likely reflecting varied pro-
portions of these neuronal subtypes across BAs,
with most variability present in the visual cor-
tex (BA17), which is known to have distinct cyto-
architecture and gene expression profiles (7, 17).
In order to further annotate inhibitory neuron
subtypes,weexaminedexpressionofknownmarker
genesassociatedwith corticallayers, developmental
origin, and interneuron classification (Fig. 2B) (13).
On the basis of in situ human brain expression
data (fig. S11) (17), our inhibitory neuron subtypes
were found to distribute spatially from the pial
surface (most superficial boundary) to white matter
(deepest boundary) of the neocortex and could
be grouped by the developmental origin of inter-
neurons from subcortical regions of the medial,
lateral, or caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE, LGE,
or CGE) (Fig. 2B) (18, 19). Furthermore, distinct
profiles of interneuron classification markers re-
vealed subtypes that parallel those identified from
the mouse somatosensory cortex (Fig. 2, B and C,
and fig. S12A) (3). Cortical regional heterogeneity
within subtypes was also observed, as evident by
a layer 3 population (In4) that showed a specific
absence of RELN/SST expression in BA17 (Fig. 2C
and fig. S11, B and D). As such, our data distin-
guished inhibitory neuron subtypes having hetero-
geneous distributions within the neocortex.
Most excitatory cortical projection or pyram-
idal neurons can be categorized by their layer
position established during neocortical develop-
ment (17) combined with their axonal projections
(Fig. 3A) (16). Our excitatory neuron subgroups,
which were also in high concordance with sub-
types identified in mice (fig. S12B) (3), expressed
known markers associated with a superficial-to-
deepcorticaldistribution(Fig.3,B toD,andfig.S13)
(13), with more than one subtype occupying most
layers. Our data set was able to resolve cortical
region specificity, as seen for the BHLHE22-positive
(Fig. 3C and fig. S13, A and D) layer 4 subtypes Ex2
and Ex3 (Fig. 4A), where Ex2 derived predom-
inantly from rostral regions, BA8 and BA10, and
Ex3 from caudal regions, BA17 and BA41/42 (Figs.
2A and 4B). Consistently, these subgroups showed
distinct gene expression (Fig. 4C and table S8) as-
sociated with neuronal electrophysiology and con-
nectivity (table S9). Furthermore, we were able to
resolve intrasubtype heterogeneity, in terms of BA-
specific expression patterns, which was observed in
all subtypes (Fig. 4B), such as within the Ex3 sub-
type between BA17 and BA41/42 regions (Fig. 4, B
and D, and table S10). As such, regional neuro-
physiological differences in cortical regions may be
attributed to not only variations in the propor-
tions of interneuron and projection neuron subtypes,
but also to cell-intrinsic transcriptomic differences
among single neurons within a subtype. Con-
sistent with this possibility, we found that genes
having known variability between the visual and
temporal cortices from in situ hybridization (ISH)
studies (17) also had transcriptomic differences
that could be attributed to subtypes defined by
our data set (fig. S14A and table S11) (13). There-
fore, our data highlight subtle yet region-defining
gene expression signatures among specific neuro-
nal subtypes that could not be detected from
bulk analyses (fig. S14B).
To further understand the extent of hetero-
geneity that may exist within subtypes, we iden-
tified genes varying globally (table S12 and fig. S15A)
or expressed differentially within each BA (table
S13 and fig. S15B) for each subgroup. Although a
subset of In and Ex subgroup-variable genes was
associatedwithdifferentialexpressionbetweenbrain
regions, a large proportion were distinct (fig. S15C).

 Therefore, the potential exists for not only intra-
regional cortical transcriptomic differences, but
alsofurtherintrasubtypeheterogeneity. Thismight
reflect a technical need for increased sampling
depth for further subtype resolution, yet may also
indicate the potential for even more diversity
within subtypes associated with a broader range
of individualized neuronal activities. Consistent
with these observations, proportions of subgroup-
variable genes were associated with neuronal sub-
type classification, postsynaptic function, and known
regional expression variability (fig. S15C). These
data support further local and regional functional
heterogeneity existing among defined subtypes.
Our results demonstrate that postmortem SNS
can identify expected and previously unidentified
neuronal subtypes that provide insight into brain
function through distinct profiles of activity-
defininggenes(fig. S16 andtableS14). Furthermore,
given that only a very small subset of layer-specific
markers used in our analyses (CARTPT, CHRNA7,
PDYN, and RELN) was found to have ISH differ-
ences between individual donors (17), our subtypes
can be expected to be globally representative. In-
deed, our subtypes remain highly conserved in
mice (3), with differences highlighting evolutionary
changes in potential orthologs (fig. S12). Our data
sets reveal shared gene expression signatures that
can distinguish subtypes and regional identity,
supporting a transcriptional basis for well-known
differences in cortical cytoarchitecture. Additional
heterogeneity found within single neuronal tran-
scriptomes may further reflect activities of complex
neuronal networks that vary with function and
time, as well as underlying genomic mosaicism that
exists in human cortical neurons (10, 20–23). Our
studythuslaysthegroundworkforhigh-throughput

BIOCHEMISTRY
Synthetic evolutionary origin of a
proofreading reverse transcriptase
Jared W. Ellefson,* Jimmy Gollihar, Raghav Shroff, Haridha Shivram,
Vishwanath R. Iyer, Andrew D. Ellington*
Most reverse transcriptase (RT) enzymes belong to a single protein family of ancient
evolutionary origin. These polymerases are inherently error prone, owing to their lack of a
proofreading (3′- 5′ exonuclease) domain. To determine if the lack of proofreading is a
historical coincidence or a functional limitation of reverse transcription, we attempted to
evolve a high-fidelity, thermostable DNA polymerase to use RNA templates efficiently. The
evolutionarily distinct reverse transcription xenopolymerase (RTX) actively proofreads on
DNA and RNA templates, which greatly improves RT fidelity. In addition, RTX enables
applications such as single-enzyme reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and
direct RNA sequencing without complementary DNA isolation. The creation of RTX
confirms that proofreading is compatible with reverse transcription.
T
he molecular basis for life rests on the in-
formation flow between DNA, RNA, and pro-
teins (1). Early notions of a unidirectional
central dogma were amended after the dis-
covery of the reverse transcriptase (RT) en-
zyme (2, 3). The RT family has a single ancient
evolutionary origin based on amino acid homol-
ogy and the presence of RT across multiple do-
mains of life (4). RTs are involved in processes
such as telomere addition, mitochondrial plasmid
replication, transposition, and the proliferation of
retroviral genomes (5). It is also hypothesized to
be the catalyst in the transition of the RNA to
DNA world by providing an avenue to copy RNA
into more stable DNA genomes (6).
The progenitor of RT is postulated to be an
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Because RNA
polymerases generally lack an error-checking 3′-
5′ exonuclease domain (4, 7), proofreading activity
is also not present across the RT family, resulting
in low-fidelity reverse transcription and charac-
teristic quasispecies behavior in organisms that
rely upon it for replication (8). In contrast to RTs,
other DNA polymerase families have evolved ex-
quisite proofreading mechanisms to increase DNA
synthesis fidelity during genome replication (9).
To determine whether the evolutionary divide
between RTs and DNA polymerases is a matter
of history or function, we have attempted to
directly evolve a reverse transcription xenopo-
lymerase (RTX; Fig. 1A) from an error-correcting
DNA polymerase using a modified directed
evolution strategy (10), reverse transcription–
compartmentalized self-replication (RT-CSR) (Fig.
1B). RT-CSR enables the simultaneous screening
of up to 109 polymerase variants for RT activity.
We chose the Archaeal family-B DNA poly-
merases (polB) for directed evolution of the RTX
as they are monomeric, hyperthermostable, high-
ly processive, and contain proofreading domains.
Attempts to rationally design these enzymes to
use RNA templates have met with limited suc-
cess (11, 12), and initial experiments confirmed
that two common polB enzymes from Pyrococcus
furiosus and Thermococcus kodakarensis (KOD)
(13, 14) failed to polymerize across five template
RNA bases (fig. S1). Modeling to identify mutations
enabling RT activity was deemed impractical,
given the extensive contacts these polymerases
make with the template (>50 direct interactions).
We initiated evolution using low-stringency RT-
CSR (10 RNA residues) with a random library
