ABSTRACT
Background Coeliac disease (CD) incidence has
increased in recent decades, characterised by variations
according to sex, age at diagnosis, year of birth, month
of birth and region of birth. Genetic susceptibility and
exposure to gluten are the necessary factors in CD
aetiology, although several environmental factors are
considered.
Methods A nationwide prospective cohort longitudinal
study was conducted consisting of 1 912 204 children
aged 0–14.9 years born in Sweden from 1991 to 2009.
A total of 6569 children were diagnosed with biopsy-
verified CD from 47 paediatric departments. Using Cox
regression, we examined the association between CD
diagnosis and season of birth, region of birth and year
of birth.
Results Overall, CD risk was higher for children born
during spring, summer and autumn as compared with
children born during winter: adjusted HR for spring 1.08
(95% CI 1.01 to 1.16), summer 1.10 (95% CI 1.03 to
1.18) and autumn 1.10 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.18).
Increased CD risk was highest if born in the south,
followed by central Sweden when compared with
children born in northern Sweden. Children diagnosed at
<2 years had an increased CD risk if born in spring
while those diagnosed at 2–14.9 years the risk was
increased for summer and autumn births. The birth
cohort of 1991–1996 had increased CD risk if born
during spring, for the 1997–2002 birth cohort the risk
increased for summer and autumn births, while for the
birth cohort of 2003–2009 the risk was increased if
born during autumn.
Conclusions Season of birth and region of birth are
independently and jointly associated with increased risk
of developing CD during the first 15 years of life.
Seasonal variation in infectious load is the likely
explanation.
INTRODUCTION
Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enter-
opathy
with
a
multifactorial
aetiology.1
Only
persons ingesting gluten and expressing human
leucocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 or DQ8 can develop
CD.1
Apart
from
gluten
other
environmental
factors have been suggested including: mode of
delivery, infant feeding, gut microbiota, infections,
socioeconomic status and season of birth, though
evidence is contradictory.2–7 Several studies have
shown that spring/summer birth is more common
in patients with CD compared with their healthy
counterparts8–11 suggesting a role of seasonal expo-
sures. A seasonal pattern has also been shown for
type 1 diabetes,12
in
children with
a
double
diagnosis of CD and type 1 diabetes6 and, in other
immune-mediated diseases.13 Viral infections have
a seasonal pattern and have also been associated
with increased CD5–14
15 and type 1 diabetes
risk.16
In areas of high latitude such as Sweden, a sea-
sonal
pattern
in
exposure
to
sunlight
and
ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is an exposure of
interest. UV-B is needed for the synthesis of
vitamin D in the skin yet in higher latitudes little
vitamin D is synthesised during winter thus popula-
tions depend on dietary vitamin D or supplementa-
tion. Vitamin D deficiency might be associated to
seasonal variations in birth seen in autoimmune dis-
eases including CD. It has also been suggested that
vitamin D supplementation could contribute to
increased
CD
risk.17
Geographically,
Sweden
stretches about 1570 km from north to south, lying
between latitudes 55° and 69° North. Southern
Sweden is characterised by intense sunlight in spring
and summer, while in northern Sweden spring is
generally colder and summer is shorter.18

What is already known on this topic?
▸ Coeliac disease (CD) is increasing worldwide
suggesting environmental factors in the
aetiology.
▸ CD incidence varies with sex, age at diagnosis,
year of birth, month of birth and by
geographical location.
What this study adds?
▸ Spring births was associated with increased
coeliac disease (CD) risk if diagnosed before
2 years of age while summer and autumn
births were associated with high risk if
diagnosed after 2 years of age.
▸ CD risk is higher in southern Sweden compared
with the north with differences in seasonal
incidence pattern.
▸ Seasonal viral infections during a vulnerable
period of immune development are the likely
explanation to observed seasonality but does
not explain geographical differences.

 observed between birth cohorts during the CD epidemic (1985–
1995) and postepidemic years, possibly related to variations in
environmental exposures.22 The objective of this study was to
explore the effects of season of birth on the risk of CD compar-
ing different areas and time-periods in order to generate
hypotheses about environmental factors associated with CD
seasonality.
METHODS
The study used a prospective cohort longitudinal design with
data obtained through the Swedish national registers, accessed
through the Umeå SIMSAM Lab (SIMSAM: Swedish Initiative
for
Research
on
Microdata
in
the
Medical
and
Social
Sciences).23 Individual data obtained from Statistics Sweden and
the Swedish National Childhood CD Incidence Register was
linked using the Swedish personal identity number.24
The study consisted all children aged 0–14.9 years, born
between 1991 and 2009. A total of 1 912 204 children were
identified of which 6596 were diagnosed with CD, from 47
paediatric departments. CD diagnostic criteria were a small
intestinal mucosa with villous atrophy, according to the 1990
European Society for Paediatric Gastroentology, Hepatology and
Nutrition criteria.25
Definition of explanatory variables
Season of birth was classified according to four seasons: winter
(December, January, February), spring (March, April, May),
summer ( June, July, August) and autumn (September, October,
November). Region of birth was classified according to the
Swedish national areas of the nomenclature of territorial units
for statistics (NUTS 1), a geocode standard developed by the
European Union for referencing administrative divisions of
countries for statistical purposes. Age at diagnosis was defined
as age when the first positive small intestinal biopsy was
obtained and was estimated in years, divided into two categor-
ies:
0–1.9
(children
<2 years)
and
2–14.9 years
(children
between 2 and <15 years of age). Year of birth was categorised
into four birth cohorts; the cohort of 1991–1996 represented
children
born
during
CD
epidemic,
1997–2002
included
children born immediately after the epidemic and 2003–2009
were born after the epidemic had abated.
Statistical analysis
Average CD incidence rates were calculated per month of birth
and region of birth by dividing the number of cases diagnosed
by the number of person years of follow-up, and reported per
100 000 person years. Cox proportional hazard regression
models were used to estimate the HR for CD diagnosis. For CD
cases we considered age at diagnosis, while non-cases were con-
sidered censored at 15 years of age (the highest age included) or
age at the end of the study follow-up (31 December 2009). The
proportional hazards assumption for the independent variables
was tested graphically with Kaplan–Meier curves. Bivariable
(unadjusted) analyses were performed to explore the associa-
tions between CD and each of the explanatory variables. In the
multivariable analysis (adjusted), each variable was adjusted for
other studied factors. Both analyses were repeated while stratify-
ing for age, region and birth cohort. Interaction was investigated
for independent variables as cross terms pairwise in the adjusted
model and checked for significance. Incidence rates were calcu-
lated using Microsoft Excel 2008 (V
.12.3.2) and Cox propor-
tional hazard was done using SPSS V
.22.0 for Windows (SPSS,
Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Ethical considerations
The Regional Ethical Vetting Board in Umeå approved research
based on data obtained from the Umeå SIMSAM Lab.
STUDY FINDINGS
Characteristics of the study population
The total number of children, irrespective of their CD status
is given in relation to season and region of birth and sex in
table 1. The proportional hazards assumption was fulfilled for
all studied variables and no significant interaction between inde-
pendent variables and CD was found (results not shown). CD
risk was higher for children born during spring, summer and
autumn as compared with children born during winter. After
adjusting for region of birth and sex, the effect of season of
birth remained the same as observed in the unadjusted model,

 except for minor changes. In the unadjusted and the adjusted
analyses, the risk of developing CD was lowest in northern
region compared with southern and central Sweden. CD risk
was more pronounced in girls in both unadjusted and adjusted
analyses (table 1).
CD incidence rate in relation to region and season of birth
The incidence rate pattern for the NUTS regions differed by
month of birth as shown in figure 1. In northern Sweden, the
incidence rate was low throughout the year except for an
increase in April and May. In central Sweden, an increase in CD
incidence began in February to May. In the remaining months
of June to November, the incidence rate appeared to drop aside
from an increase in August. In southern Sweden, December to
May were marked by a gradual increase, except for a decrease
from June to November.
CD risk in relation to region and season of birth stratified
for age
Among children below 2 years of age, CD risk was higher
when born during spring compared with winter, no major dif-
ferences were observed for other seasons, region of birth was
not associated with CD risk (table 2). Children 2–14.9 years
born during summer and autumn had an increased CD risk
compared with those born during winter. This age group had
the highest risk if born in southern Sweden, followed by
central Sweden. This effect remained after adjusting for season
and sex (table 2). CD risk was higher in girls than in boys
regardless of age, although children aged 2–14.9 years had
higher OR (table 2).
CD risk in relation to region and season of birth stratified
by birth cohort
Among children born 1991–1996 the risk of developing CD
was significantly increased if born during spring compared with
winter. In the 1997–2002 birth cohort, CD risk was increased if
born during summer and autumn. In the 2003–2009 cohort,
CD risk was increased if born in autumn compared with winter
(table 3). For children born between 1991 and 1996, the risk
was increased for central and southern Sweden compared with
northern Sweden. For children born in 1997–2002, increased
CD risk was associated to being born in southern Sweden com-
pared with the north, no association was observed for those
born in central Sweden. Among children born between 2003
and 2009, the risk was increased for both central and south
births compared with northern births (table 3). Girls had higher
risk compared with boys in all years. The risk was highest
among girls in the 2003–2009 birth cohort, followed by the
birth cohort of 1997–2002 (table 3).
DISCUSSION
Spring birth was associated with increased CD risk in children
diagnosed before 2 years of age while summer and autumn
births were associated with high risk in children diagnosed
after
2 years
of
age
with
noticeable
changes
over
time.
Seasonal pattern differed between regions, with increased CD
incidence rates in southern Sweden from December to May. In
central Sweden the increase started in February, while in north
this started later and was more pronounced than in other
regions. Stratification by age at diagnosis showed spring births
to be associated with increased CD risk in children diagnosed
before 2 years of age while summer and autumn births were
associated with high CD risk in children diagnosed after
2 years.
One of the limitations of this study is lack of data on infec-
tions and vitamin D level, thus at the moment inference on how
these might influence seasonality and subsequently CD risk
remains speculative and calls for further investigation. CD risk
may have been underestimated because CD cases without a PIN
code were excluded. Lacking a PIN code was mainly due to not
seeking parental consent, also a few declined to participate.
Underestimation of CD risk is also possible since Marsh 3 was
the standard for CD diagnosis; by implication potential cases,
that is, with Marsh 1–2 or with elevated serological markers
were excluded.
This is the first Swedish study investigating CD risk while
taking into account four seasons and looking at geographical
variations. The association between season of birth and CD has
been the subject of several studies from Sweden. The first study
followed children up to 1997, and found summer to be asso-
ciated with increased risk in children diagnosed before the age
of 2 years.8 Lebwohl et al using Swedish pathology data showed
a slightly increased risk in adults born during summer.9 Lewy
et al reported increased CD risk in girls born during summer
and in children diagnosed before 2 years of age but not in boys
or in older children.10 A US study reported spring birth to be
associated with increased CD risk in boys younger than 15 years
of age at diagnosis.11 All evidence supports a seasonal environ-
mental exposure in CD aetiology except for one Finnish
study.26
Children born in southern Sweden had the highest CD risk,
followed by central and the lowest in northern Sweden. The
Swedish population is considered genetically homogenous with
>50% prevalence of HLA risk genes.27 Consequently, geo-
graphical differences in CD risk are not fully explained by
genetic clustering, suggesting the role of other environmental
factors. Interestingly, CD is associated with acute viral infections
like rotavirus, astrovirus and adenovirus and other viral infec-
tions.5

28 One hypothesis for increased CD risk and
spring/summer birth is that, those infants are more likely to be
weaned and introduced to gluten during autumn/winter, a time
characterised by exposure to seasonal viral infections. Some
studies suggested breast feeding to be protective against CD3
and there are several possible mechanisms for this including a
modulatory effect on gut microbiota and its direct effect on the
immune system.29 However, more recent studies could not
confirm breast feeding’s protective effect.4 30–33 Viral infections
influence the intestinal microbiota, the barrier function and

 increase mucosal permeability, which might be the mechanism
of action in CD pathogenesis; however, this requires further
investigation.34
In the north, the high incidence period started later compared
with the south and central parts of Sweden. Geographical differ-
ence in awareness is a possible explanation, though it cannot
fully explain these variations since our previous screening
studies reported a similar pattern between north and south as
reported in this paper with a 1/3 prescreening detection rate in
all regions.20 Among Swedish physicians, it is known that the
yearly epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus and
influenza start in southern Sweden and spread northwards over
a couple of months,35 which supports our findings. Moreover,
there is a difference in distribution of rotavirus genotypes
between Swedish regions.35
Another suggested mechanism for seasonal variation in CD
risk is vitamin D deficiency due to differences in sunlight and
UV-B exposure.36 Suboptimal levels of vitamin D during early
childhood are a risk factor for immune-mediated diseases
including multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and
type 1 diabetes mellitus.13 37 Sweden has large regional differ-
ences in sunlight and UV-B exposure,38 thus the low CD risk in
the north does not support this hypothesis as this region
receives few hours of sun exposure throughout the year.
Moreover, in Sweden every child is recommended and offered
government-funded vitamin D supplementation from 1 week to
2 years of age, ensuring adequate levels. A remaining possible
link to sunlight and vitamin D is that pregnant women who give
birth in spring have the lowest levels of vitamin D during late
gestation when important programming and development of the
fetal immune system takes place.39 Another hypothesis suggests
increased CD risk due to high levels of vitamin D; this fits the
situation in south Sweden.17 This hypothesis is still new and is
based on comparisons between countries. Tanpowpong and
Camargo suggested a model where introduction of gluten, low
levels of vitamin D and exposure to viral infections are

plausible remains to be confirmed.
CONCLUSION
W
e have confirmed a statistically significant effect of season of
birth on the risk of being diagnosed with CD during childhood
with the highest CD risk if born in south Sweden. Viral infec-
tions are the strongest possible risk factor in favour of our find-
ings, although the role of vitamin D during pregnancy is still
plausible. Whatever exposures are important in explaining sea-
sonality, they have to work in a well-defined period, that is,
during early life when the immune system is in an important
developmental phase, otherwise there would be no seasonal
pattern.
