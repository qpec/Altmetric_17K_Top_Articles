Abstract 
Purpose: Care bundles are recommended in patients at high risk for acute kidney injury (AKI), although they have 
not been proven to improve outcomes. We sought to establish the efficacy of an implementation of the Kidney Dis-
ease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines to prevent cardiac surgery-associated AKI in high risk patients 
defined by renal biomarkers.
Methods: In this single-center trial, we examined the effect of a “KDIGO bundle” consisting of optimization of volume 
status and hemodynamics, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, and preventing hyperglycemia in high risk patients 
defined as urinary [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] > 0.3 undergoing cardiac surgery. The primary endpoint was the rate of AKI 
defined by KDIGO criteria within the first 72 h after surgery. Secondary endpoints included AKI severity, need for dialy-
sis, length of stay, and major adverse kidney events (MAKE) at days 30, 60, and 90.
Results: AKI was significantly reduced with the intervention compared to controls [55.1 vs. 71.7%; ARR 16.6% (95 CI 
5.5–27.9%); p = 0.004]. The implementation of the bundle resulted in significantly improved hemodynamic param-
eters at different time points (p < 0.05), less hyperglycemia (p < 0.001) and use of ACEi/ARBs (p < 0.001) compared to 
controls. Rates of moderate to severe AKI were also significantly reduced by the intervention compared to controls. 
There were no significant effects on other secondary outcomes.
Conclusion: An implementation of the KDIGO guidelines compared with standard care reduced the frequency 
and severity of AKI after cardiac surgery in high risk patients. Adequately powered multicenter trials are warranted to 
examine mortality and long-term renal outcomes.

Introduction
 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-recognized com-
plication following cardiac surgery and significantly 
affects morbidity and mortality [1]. Up to 30% of patients 
develop AKI after cardiac surgery, whereas severe AKI 
requiring dialysis is relatively rare [1]. Approximately 
1% of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery develop a 
severe dialysis-dependent AKI, and this severity of AKI 
is associated with especially poor outcomes [1]. Although

Take home message: An implementation of the KDIGO guidelines 
compared with standard care reduced the frequency and severity of 
cardiac surgery-associated AKI (CSA-AKI) in high risk patients identified 
by biomarkers. Future studies will be needed to address whether this 
approach has an impact on long-term outcomes.

the mechanisms of AKI are not fully understood, injury 
to renal tubular epithelial cells is a universal aspect of 
the disease. Despite numerous clinical trials using sev-
eral interventions [2], a reliable means to prevent AKI 
remains elusive.
In earlier studies, interventions for AKI were started 
after a change in kidney function, a surrogate for kidney 
damage, had occurred [3, 4]. However, no intervention 
has yet demonstrated an effect in treating AKI once it has 
occurred [3, 4]. In contrast to these studies, the Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guide-
lines for AKI recommend to initiate different supportive 
measures (volume management, maintenance of adequate 
blood pressure, and judicious avoidance of nephrotox-
ins) in patients at high risk for AKI [5], although it has 
not been proven that this approach reduces the occur-
rence or severity of AKI. High risk patients can be identi-
fied by renal biomarkers, but measuring biomarkers in all 
patients reduces the specificity of biomarkers. Therefore, 
it was suggested that renal biomarkers should be used in 
patients with a certain risk profile consisting of different 
risk factors and/or certain clinical conditions (e.g., sepsis 
or major surgery) [6, 7].
In contrast to the conventional biomarkers serum cre-
atinine and urine output, which are markers of kidney 
function, new biomarkers allow a diagnosis to be made 
earlier and they allow kidney injury to be diagnosed even 
in the absence of concurrent or subsequent dysfunc-
tion [7]. A biomarker-based approach was first used in 
the EARLYARF trial but the applied biomarkers showed 
poor predictive performance [8]. The two new renal bio-
markers, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 
(IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 
(TIMP-2), are involved in G1 cell cycle arrest and are 
able to identify patients at high risk for AKI [9]. We have 
previously shown that urinary [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] has 
excellent performance in predicting cardiac surgery-
associated AKI (CSA-AKI) [10].
To investigate whether an implementation of a sup-
portive care “bundle” in high risk patients for AKI as 
suggested by the KDIGO guidelines can reduce the 
occurrence and severity of CSA-AKI, we performed a 
single-center, clinical randomized controlled trial. Our 
goal was to acquire phase 2 equivalent data to support 
a larger multicenter trial to examine the effectiveness of 
a KDIGO bundle in reducing mortality and long-term 
renal dysfunction.
Methods
Participants
Eligible patients were adults at high risk for AKI 
who underwent cardiac surgery with the use of 
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at the University of 
Muenster (Germany), between August 2014 and Decem-
ber 2015. High risk for AKI was defined as urinary 
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] ≥ 0.3 (Nephrocheck® Test) 4 h after 
CPB.
Procedures
The surgical procedure and perioperative care were per-
formed according to the standard of care for the center. 
All cardiac surgery patients received a central venous 
catheter and an arterial line. In the intraoperative period, 
patients with a low ejection fraction, known regional 
wall motion abnormalities, and/or valvular dysfunctions 
received a transesophageal echocardiography to moni-
tor heart function during the operation (the probe was 
removed after surgery). [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] was meas-
ured in every patient undergoing on-pump cardiac sur-
gery 4 h after CPB disconnection. According to recently 
published trials [9, 10], patients with an increased 
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] are at high risk for the develop-
ment of AKI and we therefore used this test to enrich the 
study population. Discarded urine was used to measure 
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] and identify patients eligible for the 
study. Prior to patients being randomized into the study, 
the trial investigators obtained informed consent for par-
ticipation in the study. Patients assigned to the control 
group received standard care including the specification 
to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg and 
central venous pressure (CVP) between 8 and 10 mmHg. 
Patients received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibi-
tors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) 
once the hemodynamic situation stabilized and hyper-
tension occurred (according to the recommendations of 
the American College of Cardiology Foundation 2011). 
Patients assigned to the intervention group received a 
strictly controlled implementation of the KDIGO guide-
lines (“KDIGO CT surgery bundle”) consisting of the 
following measures: avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, 
discontinuation of ACEi and ARBs for the first 48 h after 
surgery, close monitoring of serum creatinine and urine 
output, avoidance of hyperglycemia for the first 72 h 
after surgery, consideration of alternatives to radiocon-
trast agents, close hemodynamic monitoring by using 
a PICCO catheter with an optimization of the volume 
status and hemodynamic parameters according to a pre-
specified algorithm (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the occurrence of AKI 
within the first 72 h after cardiac surgery. We defined 
AKI according to the KDIGO criteria (Supplementary 
Table S1). Secondary endpoints were severity of AKI 
 1553
within 72 h, the 30-, 60-, and 90-day all-cause mortal-
ity, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) during 
index hospitalization and after 30, 60, and 90 days, per-
sistent renal dysfunction (PRD) at days 30, 60, and 90 
(defined as serum creatinine ≥0.5 mg/dl as compared to 
baseline), MAKEn (major adverse kidney events defined 
as combination of mortality, need for RRT, and PRD at 
day n; n = 30, 60, and 90, respectively), length of stay in 
the intensive care unit (ICU), and length of hospital stay.
We abstracted clinical variables from the medical 
record. The adherence to the hemodynamic protocol was 
documented every 3 h. Initiation of RRT was at the dis-
cretion of the ICU clinicians. Criteria for RRT were not 
included in the protocol.
Statistical analysis
We calculated a necessary sample size based on the 
primary endpoint, using nQuery Advisor version 7. 
According to previous trials, 80% of patients with a 
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] ≥ 0.3 developed CSA-AKI [10]. The 
primary efficacy analysis was intended to show superior-
ity of the validation strategy, applying a two-sided χ 2 test 
on significance level α = 0.05. As a result of a lack of ref-
erence values, we hypothesized to reduce the incidence 
of AKI to 65%. Resulting from these considerations and 
a power of 80%, the required sample size was calculated 
to be 138 evaluable patients per treatment group, i.e., 276 
in total.
The primary efficacy analysis included all randomized 
patients (full analysis set) and was performed according 
to the intent-to-treat principle, i.e., all patients were ana-
lyzed according to their randomization. For the primary 
outcome and the secondary endpoint AKI severity all 
patients had complete data.
Categorical variables were summarized by frequency 
tables. Treatment groups were compared with the χ 2 test 
(or Fisher’s exact test if the respective frequency tables 
contained cells with expected counts <5). We estimated 
the odds ratio (OR) as well as the absolute risk reduc-
tion (ARR) between treatment groups, including 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). Normally distributed continu-
ous variables were expressed as mean (standard devia-
tion, SD), and were compared between groups with an 
unpaired Student’s t test. Continuous variables, which 
were not normally distributed, were analyzed using a 
nonparametric test (Mann–Whitney U test). Median val-
ues were compared between treatment groups using the 
Hodges–Lehmann estimator of location shift with asso-
ciated 95% CI. In exploratory analyses two-sided p values 
were considered noticeable (“significant”) at p ≤ 0.05. 
Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS soft-
ware (version 9.4 for Windows, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, 
NC, USA).
Results
A total of 1046 patients underwent cardiac surgery dur-
ing the recruitment period and 882 patients were prop-
erly screened because in 164 patients no PICCO device 
was available. Of these, 276 patients were enrolled and 
randomized to either the intervention group (n = 138) 
or the control group (n = 138) and included in the pri-
mary analysis (Fig. 1). All randomly assigned patients 
received their allocated treatment. Median urine 
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] was 0.50 (Q1, Q3; 0.38, 0.87) in 
the intervention and 0.61 (Q1, Q3; 0.39, 1.09) in the 
control group (p = 0.149) (Table 1). The baseline and 
intraoperative characteristics did not differ between 
groups (Table 1). Clinical care outside the trial inter-
vention was also similar (Table 1), including operative 
characteristics, volume administration, and the use of 
catecholamines. Use of catecholamines and adminis-
tered volume at the time of randomization were similar 
in both groups (Supplementary Table S2). During the 
study period, significantly more patients in the inter-
vention group [43 (31.2%)] received dobutamine com-
pared to the sham group [13 (9.4%); p < 0.001] resulting 
in a significantly increased MAP and CVP at different 
time points (Table 2). Although the use of inotropes 
was significantly higher in the intervention group, the 
occurrence of atrial fibrillation within the first 12 h 
(Table 2) and the concentration of cardiac biomark-
ers was similar between the two groups (CK-MB: 
p = 0.229, troponin I: p = 0.140). In addition, the rate 
of hyperglycemia (p < 0.001) and use of ACEi and ARBs 
(p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the interven-
tion group compared to the control group (Table 2). 
However, the total administered volume was not differ-
ent between the two groups (Table 2), but the patients 
in the intervention group received significantly less 
volume during the last 3 h of the intervention period 
(p = 0.024) (Supplementary Table S3).
The overall AKI incidence was 63.4% (175/276). Of 
the 276 study subjects, in 24 patients AKI was diag-
nosed by serum creatinine while in 143 patients, urine 
output criteria were met although the postoperative use 
of diuretics was similar in the two groups (Table 3). In 
eight patients, serum creatinine and urine output crite-
ria were met. At 12 h after randomization, median urine 
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] was 0.58 (Q1, Q3; 0.26, 1.20) in the 
intervention and 0.84 (Q1, Q3; 0.35, 1.57) in the control 
group (p = 0.045) (Table 2). Patients in the control group 
showed a non-significant change in [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] 
from 0.61 to 0.84 (p = 0.098) as compared to from 0.50 to 
0.58 (p = 0.536) in the intervention group.
The primary outcome, occurrence of AKI within 72 h 
after cardiac surgery according to the KDIGO classifi-
cation system, occurred in significantly fewer patients 
 1554
in the intervention group [76 (55.1%)] compared to the 
control [99 (71.7%)] group [p = 0.004; OR, 0.483 (95% CI, 
0.293–0.796); ARR, 16.6% (95% CI, 5.5–27.9%)] (Table 3; 
Fig. 2). In the intervention group significantly lower rates 
of moderate and severe AKI were observed compared 
to the control group [41/138 (29.7%) vs 62/138 (44.9%); 
p = 0.009; OR, 0.518 (95% CI, 0.316–0.851); ARR, 15.2% 
(95% CI, 4.0–26.5%)] (Table 3). Patients with [TIMP-
2]·[IGFBP7] > 2.0 at 4 h after cardiac surgery were at 
highest risk for developing AKI (81.3% in the interven-
tion and 83.3% in the control group). There were no 
significant differences for any of the other secondary 
outcomes, including requirement of RRT during hospital 
stay, ICU and hospital stay as well as major adverse kid-
ney events (MAKE) at day 30, 60, and 90 (Table 3).
Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial of patients undergoing 
cardiac surgery, the implementation of a bundle of sup-
portive measures in high risk patients identified by ele-
vated biomarker levels reduced the occurrence of AKI 
within 72 h compared to standard care.
The diagnosis of AKI relies on functional parameters 
that cannot be used for the early diagnosis of AKI. In 
contrast, AKI biomarkers may increase in response to a 
wide variety of insults and therefore they might be used 
to identify a status of kidney stress or an increased sus-
ceptibility to insults. Under such circumstances, bio-
markers may allow one to implement preventive and 
protective measures well before clinical AKI becomes 
manifest according to well-established definitions [11]. In

other fields of medicine, biomarkers allow an early start 
of the therapy as well as the initiation of molecularly tar-
geted therapies [12–14]. As a result, experts in the field 
of critical care nephrology asked for an implementation 
of treatment strategies in high risk patients to prevent 
AKI [15, 16]. On the basis of the good performance of 
[TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] in predicting AKI [9, 10] and the fact 
that [TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7] can be measured at the bedside, 
we decided to use these two AKI biomarkers to identify 
patients at high risk for CSA-AKI.
The pathophysiology of CSA-AKI is very complex and 
consists of renal ischemia, reperfusion, inflammation, 
oxidative stress, hemolysis, and toxins. Pharmacologi-
cal and non-pharmacological preventive strategies have 
largely failed to reduce the occurrence of CSA-AKI in 
clinical trials [17, 18], although some treatments may be 
effective in specific patient populations [19]. As several 
signaling pathways are involved in the pathophysiology of 
CSA-AKI, we implemented a bundle of supportive meas-
ures which are recommended by the KDIGO guidelines. 
This multifactorial approach may improve renal perfu-
sion [20] and reduces inflammation [21] and oxidative 
stress [21]. One would assume that these supportive bun-
dles should be implemented in the whole cardiac surgery. 
However, some of the measures are not harmful whereas 
other measures might be harmful or even against other 
guidelines and should only be applied in high risk 
patients. Here we demonstrate that the implementation 
of the KDIGO guidelines resulted in more use of dobu-
tamine, a reduced rate of hyperglycemia, and higher rate 
of discontinuing ACEi and ARBs. Although the increased 
use of dobutamine in the intervention group was asso-
ciated with a significantly increased blood pressure at 
different time points, this difference and the small sig-
nificant difference in fluids are probably not clinically 
relevant. In addition to the increased use of dobutamine, 
patients in the intervention group received a better 
hemodynamic monitoring resulting in the possibility of 
a more personalized medicine. The discontinuation of 
ACEi and ARBs might result in a change in serum creati-
nine not representing a structural AKI. However, patients 
in the intervention group showed lower tubular damage 
biomarker levels ([TIMP-2]·[IGFBP7]) at 12 h after ran-
domization, supporting the hypothesis that the imple-
mentation of the bundle dampens tubular damage and 
protects from AKI. Hyperglycemia is a common com-
plication after surgery and is reported to occur in 33.7–
74% in non-diabetic patients after cardiac surgery [22]. 
By implementing the KDIGO guidelines, we were able 
to significantly reduce the rate of hyperglycemia in the 
intervention group. However, we do not know whether 
one measure or the combination of different measures is 
responsible for the reduced AKI rate in the study group.
Recently, Osawa et al. showed that a goal-directed ther-
apy resulted in a significant reduction of the combined 
endpoint 30-day mortality and major complications 
but did not affect the occurrence of AKI [23]. However, 
patients included in this trial were not at high risk for 
AKI and the occurrence of AKI was far lower than in the 
PrevAKI trial. Our findings are in line with other studies, 
showing that a supportive bundle can reduce the occur-
rence of AKI [20, 24–26].
CSA-AKI is associated with an increased morbid-
ity and mortality [1, 27]. One would assume that reduc-
ing the incidence of AKI has an impact on morbidity and 
mortality. Although we demonstrated in this trial that the 
implementation of the KDIGO guidelines significantly 
reduced the occurrence of AKI within 72 h after cardiac 
surgery, this intervention had no impact on secondary out-
comes (ICU and hospital stay, MAKE at days 30, 60, and

90). We offer several possible reasons for these observed 
results. First, a follow-up duration of 90 days may be too 
short (e.g., in patients with relatively healthy kidneys and 
ample renal reserve before surgery). However, the associa-
tion was robust at 90 days in prior observational studies 
[28]. A between-group difference during longer follow-
up might be more likely if a benefit was not evident after 
such a short period. Second, mild to moderate AKI (as 
defined by the KDIGO classification system [5]) may not 
cause substantial chronic kidney disease (CKD). Multiple 
observational studies demonstrate a robust association 
between mild to moderate AKI and long-term declines in 
kidney function. However, patients who develop AKI (ver-
sus those who do not) in almost all observational studies 
are sicker and have more comorbidities, which also con-
tribute to the development and progression of CKD. Third, 
the rate of complications was low and the study was not 
powered to show a difference. These factors may confound 
some of the observed associations between AKI and PRD 
[29]. Fourth, we used the KDIGO criteria to diagnose AKI 
and most AKIs were diagnosed on the basis of a decreased 
urine output. The association of oliguria with patient-cen-
tered outcomes has been shown in a general ICU popula-
tion (where it is mainly shown for the higher AKI stages) 
[30], but not in a cardiac surgery population which could 
be explained by the relatively higher incidence of prerenal 
causes [31]. Further studies have to be performed to inves-
tigate whether an association of the oliguric component 
and long-term outcomes in cardiac surgery patients exists.
One strength of the PrevAKI trial is the generalizability 
of the data, because the number of exclusion criteria was 
limited. However, our active intervention was only used 
in selected patients with positive biomarker results.
The study is not without limitations. Hemodynamic 
optimization, glycemic control, and deferring ACEi/ARBs 
for the first 48 h after cardiac surgery may be already part 
of the postoperative management in other centers. How-
ever, it is known from other fields in medicine (e.g., sepsis) 
that the compliance to adhere to guidelines is low [32, 33]. 
According to the EuroSCORE, the 30-day mortality rate 
of patients in our institution is comparable with the treat-
ment in other centers. Therefore, our data suggest that 
the adherence to guidelines can reduce the occurrence 
of CSA-AKI. Although a large difference in the AKI rate 
was detected, this was not a multicenter trial and, as with 
many single-center studies, the observed effect size is likely 
inflated. Another reason why larger trials are needed is that 
small trials cannot avoid small baseline differences. There-
fore, an adequately powered multicenter trial is needed to 
confirm our results and establish a bundle of supportive 
measures to reduce the occurrence of CSA-AKI. In addi-
tion, this study was not blinded, which could contribute to 
measurement bias. Finally, we found a non-significant trend 
towards higher adverse kidney events (MAKE, requirement 
of RRT, and persistent renal dysfunction) in the interven-
tion group early after surgery. Although the power analysis 
was performed for the primary endpoint AKI within 72 h 
after cardiac surgery, it might be possible that implement-
ing this bundle of measures in cardiac surgery patients at 
high risk for AKI causes a deteriorated patient-centered out-
come. Therefore, caution needs to be exercised by interpret-
ing these results and future trials addressing this issue are 
required.
