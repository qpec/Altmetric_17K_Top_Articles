Abstract
Background
Since 2015, a major economic crisis in Brazil has led to increasing poverty and the imple-
mentation of long-term fiscal austerity measures that will substantially reduce expenditure
on social welfare programmes as a percentage of the country’s GDP over the next 20 years.
The Bolsa Famı
´lia Programme (BFP)—one of the largest conditional cash transfer pro-
grammes in the world—and the nationwide primary healthcare strategy (Estrate
´gia Sau
´de
da Famı
´lia [ESF]) are affected by fiscal austerity, despite being among the policy interven-
tions with the strongest estimated impact on child mortality in the country. We investigated
how reduced coverage of the BFP and ESF—compared to an alternative scenario where
the level of social protection under these programmes is maintained—may affect the under-
five mortality rate (U5MR) and socioeconomic inequalities in child health in the country until
2030, the end date of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Methods and findings
We developed and validated a microsimulation model, creating a synthetic cohort of all
5,507 Brazilian municipalities for the period 2017–2030. This model was based on the longi-
tudinal dataset and effect estimates from a previously published study that evaluated the
effects of poverty, the BFP, and the ESF on child health. We forecast the economic crisis
and the effect of reductions in BFP and ESF coverage due to current fiscal austerity on the
U5MR, and compared this scenario with a scenario where these programmes maintain the

 levels of social protection by increasing or decreasing with the size of Brazil’s vulnerable
populations (policy response scenarios). We used fixed effects multivariate regression mod-
els including BFP and ESF coverage and accounting for secular trends, demographic and
socioeconomic changes, and programme duration effects. With the maintenance of the lev-
els of social protection provided by the BFP and ESF, in the most likely economic crisis sce-
nario the U5MR is expected to be 8.57% (95% CI: 6.88%–10.24%) lower in 2030 than under
fiscal austerity—a cumulative 19,732 (95% CI: 10,207–29,285) averted under-five deaths
between 2017 and 2030. U5MRs from diarrhoea, malnutrition, and lower respiratory tract
infections are projected to be 39.3% (95% CI: 36.9%–41.8%), 35.8% (95% CI: 31.5%–
39.9%), and 8.5% (95% CI: 4.1%–12.0%) lower, respectively, in 2030 under the mainte-
nance of BFP and ESF coverage, with 123,549 fewer under-five hospitalisations from all
causes over the study period. Reduced coverage of the BFP and ESF will also dispropor-
tionately affect U5MR in the most vulnerable areas, with the U5MR in the poorest quintile of
municipalities expected to be 11.0% (95% CI: 8.0%–13.8%) lower in 2030 under the mainte-
nance of BFP and ESF levels of social protection than under fiscal austerity, compared to
no difference in the richest quintile. Declines in health inequalities over the last decade will
also stop under a fiscal austerity scenario: the U5MR concentration index is expected to
remain stable over the period 2017–2030, compared to a 13.3% (95% CI: 5.6%–21.8%)
reduction under the maintenance of BFP and ESF levels of protection. Limitations of our
analysis are the ecological nature of the study, uncertainty around future macroeconomic
scenarios, and potential changes in other factors affecting child health. A wide range of sen-
sitivity analyses were conducted to minimise these limitations.
Conclusions
The implementation of fiscal austerity measures in Brazil can be responsible for substan-
tively higher childhood morbidity and mortality than expected under maintenance of social
protection—threatening attainment of Sustainable Development Goals for child health and
reducing inequality.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• There is little evidence on the health impacts of economic crisis and fiscal austerity mea-
sures in low- and middle-income countries with fragile social protection systems and
high poverty rates. Furthermore, there is poor understanding of how austerity measures
could threaten attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in these
countries.
• A platform of long-term fiscal austerity measures is underway in Brazil in response to
acute economic and political crises. Little is known about the possible impact of the
planned reductions (as percentage of country GDP) in expenditure on social welfare
programmes over the next two decades on health outcomes.

 What did the researchers do and find?
• We forecast the effects of the economic crisis and austerity measures on two key social
welfare programmes (the Bolsa Famı

Famı
´lia [ESF]) and on child morbidity and mortality in Brazil using a synthetic cohort
of 5,507 municipalities using a robust modelling technique—discrete-time microsimu-
lation—with municipality-specific time trends and parameters.
• Our forecasts indicate that over the period 2017–2030, reducing coverage of the BFP
and ESF, compared with maintaining their coverage, could result in a higher child mor-
tality rate—up to 8.6% higher in 2030. These austerity measures would then be responsi-
ble for almost 20,000 avoidable childhood deaths and 124,000 avoidable childhood
hospitalisations between 2017 and 2030.
• According to our estimates, poorer municipalities would be disproportionately affected,
ensuring that Brazil’s already high inequalities would persist until at least 2030. In con-
trast, maintaining BFP and ESF coverage would contribute to reducing these high
inequalities, in line with the SDGs.
• A range of sensitivity analyses show that, even under different simulated intensities and
durations of economic crisis and reductions in BFP and ESF coverage, the numbers of
avoidable childhood deaths and hospitalisations under austerity measures are expected
to be high.
What do these findings mean?
• Our study suggests that reduced coverage of poverty-alleviation and primary care pro-
grammes may result in a substantial number of preventable child deaths and hospitalisa-
tions in Brazil.
• These austerity measures will disproportionately impact child mortality in the poorest
municipalities, disrupting previous declines in inequality in child health outcomes.
• The implementation of austerity measures in LMICs during economic crises is likely to
threaten achievement of the SDGs related to poverty reduction, improving health, and
reducing health inequality.
Introduction
Several studies have examined the effects of economic crises on health outcomes in high-
income countries [1], but very little evidence covers low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs). Some studies suggest that economic crises in LMICs may have particularly detrimen-
tal impacts on child health [2,3], but evidence remains sparse. This is an important knowledge
gap given that the global economic crisis has now affected many LMICs and may impede prog-
ress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Poverty is one of the most important
social determinants of child health, and poverty-reduction programmes have contributed to
the decrease of under-five morbidity and mortality in several countries [4,5].

 The Brazilian economy experienced one of its strongest economic crises in recent years,
with GDP falling by more than 8% since mid-2014 [6,7]. Amid a deep political crisis, a new
government came to power on a platform to stabilise the public finances through long-term
fiscal austerity measures that will substantially reduce expenditure on social welfare pro-
grammes as a percentage of the country’s GDP. The most impactful austerity measure is the
Constitutional Amendment 95 (EC95), which will not be limited to the economic crisis, but
will last for the next 20 years, reducing the dimension of the already fragile welfare state in Bra-
zil (Box 1) [8,9].
Effectively, there is no possibility of real growth in healthcare and social protection expendi-
tures from the federal government, which is important given the current low expenditure on
health from public sources (relative to other middle-income countries and countries in Latin
America), sizeable predicted population growth in Brazil, and near certain growth in costly
Box 1. Economic crisis and Brazil’s austerity measures
Economic crisis scenarios
Since 2014, a sharp and deep recession in Brazil has unfolded, with annual GDP con-
tractions of 3.8% and 3.6% in 2015 and 2016, respectively [10]. The economic crisis led
to increasing unemployment, mainly in low-income populations, and the poverty rate
(those with an income of less than US$43 a month) has increased from 7.4% in 2014 to
8.7% in 2015, with the extreme poverty rate (those with an income of less than US$21 a
month) increasing from 2.8% to 3.4%. We model three economic crisis scenarios in
our analysis based on 2017 World Bank projections [7]. These estimated that poverty
rates for 2016 and 2017 would increase to 9.7% and 9.8%, respectively, in a milder eco-
nomic crisis (called scenario 1 in the study) and 9.8% and 10.3%, respectively, in a
stronger crisis (scenario 2). In scenario 1 the economic crisis would end in 2018, whilst
in scenario 2 it would end in 2020. A third economic crisis scenario (scenario 3) was
also examined that prolonged scenario 2 until 2022. While the recession technically
ended, in terms of GDP growth, in late 2017, the economic crisis persists, with unem-
ployment rates, income inequality, and poverty levels worsening. At the moment of
writing, scenario 2 is the most probable: even if GDP grows in 2018, there will be a
time lag until the poverty rate starts to decline, considering the high income inequality
of the country [7,11].
Policy response scenarios
Since 2016, in the depths of the economic crisis, a newly installed government has initi-
ated a range of fiscal austerity measures [12–14]. The most controversial, and potentially
most impactful, was the Constitutional Amendment 95 (EC95), which was approved in
2016 and implemented in 2017 [8,9]. It abolished minimum federal expenditures on
social protection and health that were established in the 1988 constitution, and limited
the growth in annual federal expenditure on social protection and healthcare to inflation
for the next 20 years. Simulations of the effects of EC95 on social assistance and health-
care budgets have been performed by the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic
Research [8,9]. Fig 1 has been drawn based on these data.

 health burdens. It is highly likely that the Bolsa Famı
´lia Programme (BFP) and Estrate
´gia
Sau
´de da Famı
´lia (ESF) budgets, as major components of the federal health and social protec-
tion budget, will be directly affected and their coverage reduced proportionally to EC95 budget
reductions (see S1 Text for more detail).
We envision two policy response scenarios: one that follows EC95, with reductions in BFP
and ESF coverage (the austerity scenario), and a second hypothetical situation, where funds
for the BFP and ESF are increased in line with increases in poverty (a maintenance of social
protection scenario).
While economic recession in Brazil technically ended in late 2017, recovery is likely to be
fragile given the depth of the economic contraction since 2014 and the ongoing political crisis
in the country; continued increases in unemployment, income inequality, and poverty are
indicative of a persistent economic crisis [6,7].
The programmes most likely to be affected by austerity measures include the BFP—one of the
largest conditional cash transfer programmes of the world—and the ESF—Brazil’s national pri-
mary healthcare strategy and principal vehicle for achieving universal health coverage. Available
evidence indicates that these programmes have reduced child mortality and health inequalities
[4,15,16], and contributed to Brazil’s achievement of Millennium Development Goal 4 (a two-
thirds reduction in under-five mortality rate [U5MR]) 2 years early in 2013 (Box 2).

spending, the comparison is between the real spending in the period 2004–2015 and the simulated spending if the Constitutional Amendment 95 (EC95) were applied
during the same period; for social assistance, the comparison is between the simulated spending necessary to maintain the existing levels of protection for the years
2017–2028 and the simulated spending according to the currently implemented EC95.

 Despite an increasing number of retrospective studies on the effects of economic crisis on
health outcomes, systematic literature searches yielded no studies forecasting health impacts of
economic crisis or austerity measures in LMICs (S1 Text). These types of studies are vital for
evidence-based decision-making in these settings. We forecast the effects of the ongoing eco-
nomic crisis in Brazil on child mortality and hospitalisations during the period 2017–2030
under reductions in BFP and ESF coverage—proportional to the budget constraints of fiscal
austerity—or maintenance of the level of social protection currently provided by these pro-
grammes. We also evaluate if these reductions will affect Brazil’s progress towards the third
and tenth SDGs (improving health and reducing inequalities, respectively). Our forecasts are
based on previously documented health impacts of the BFP and ESF using a nationwide cohort
of 5,507 Brazilian municipalities [4,15].
Box 2. The Bolsa Famı
´lia Programme and Estrate
´gia Sau
´de da
Famı
´lia in Brazil
The BFP was launched in 2003 and expanded quickly. In 2016, it covered 13.6 million
families (approximately 25% of the Brazilian population) with a budget of US$8.8 billion
—one of the largest conditional cash transfer programmes in the world. Conditional
cash transfer programmes are social security systems that provide funds for eligible low-
income families, but only if conditions (or conditionalities), usually related to the health
and education of their children, are met [5]. The BFP covers extremely poor families
(with an income of <US$21 per month) and poor families (with an income between US
$21 and US$43) with vulnerable individuals, such as pregnant women, new mothers,
children, or adolescents. Monthly cash transfers range from US$18 to US$175 depend-
ing on household poverty and the number of vulnerable individuals. Funds are received,
when present, by the mother of the family. In the BFP, the conditionalities that must be
satisfied include school attendance of children, vaccination and regular health check-ups
for children, and prenatal and postnatal visit attendance for expecting and new mothers
[17]. Evidence demonstrates that the BFP has improved child nutrition and reduced
child mortality in Brazil, with high municipal BFP coverage associated with a 17% reduc-
tion in U5MR over the period 2004–2009 [4,18].
The ESF is a community-based model of primary healthcare, centred on family health
teams staffed by a doctor, nurse, nurse assistant, and community health workers provid-
ing healthcare to locally defined populations. Approximately 3,500 individuals are regis-
tered per team and receive a broad package of primary care services including basic
curative care, health promotion, health education, and specific targeted programmes
addressing women and children’s health, HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, and cardiovas-
cular health. A sizeable evidence base has grown demonstrating the impact of the ESF,
including on child health. High municipal ESF coverage was associated with a 12%
reduction in U5MR over the period 2004–2009 [4]; in addition, there are studies show-
ing that ESF expansion was associated with declines in hospitalisations and mortality
from amenable causes [15,16]. A more detailed explanation of how the BFP and ESF
affect child health is provided in S2 Text and represented in Fig 2.

 Methods
Modelling approach and underlying assumptions
This study uses discrete-time microsimulation to forecast the impact of the economic crisis
and policy response scenarios in Brazil on overall and cause-specific U5MRs and the under-
five hospitalisation rate (U5HR) from 2017 to 2030.
Microsimulation is increasingly used in epidemiology and is particularly useful to evaluate
both overall and subgroup impacts of public policies [19–21]. It can provide more accurate
estimates of policy effects than traditional compartmental models or time-series forecasting
models, which use only the average values in the population. This is because microsimulation
allows the modelling of individual-specific characteristics and associated probabilities of the
outcome, and when both are derived from existing datasets, the original correlation structure
between variables and non-linear effects can be taken into account [21,22]. In our study, we
exploited the large number of municipalities in Brazil (using the 5,507 present in 2000 of the
5,570 present today) to deploy a novel ecological-level approach, which both draws on the
strengths of microsimulation described above, but additionally captures spillover effects of
poverty-alleviation and primary care programmes at the community level [4].
The modelling approach adopted for this study was developed in two stages. First, we cre-
ated a synthetic cohort of all Brazilian municipalities for the period 2010–2030 as an extension,
or post-sample forecasting, of a longitudinal dataset for the period 2000–2010 used previously
in retrospective impact evaluations [4,15]. This dataset included all municipalities and all vari-
ables. In the previous studies, longitudinal fixed effects multivariate regressions, adjusted for
demographic and socioeconomic factors, were used to estimate the effectiveness of the BFP
and ESF in decreasing child mortality and hospitalisations. Municipalities were our unit of
analysis, and all Brazilian municipalities used the previous study were considered in the study
and its sensitivity analyses (n = 5,507).

 We simulated municipality-specific changes in poverty rates and the other socioeconomic
variables over time according to economic crisis scenarios for the years 2010–2030, and BFP
and ESF coverage according to policy response scenarios. Changes in relevant demographic
variables over time, such as fertility rate and number of live births per municipality, were also
modelled.
Second, for each year and each municipality, U5MR and U5HR were estimated as out-
comes of the same longitudinal fixed effects regressions using the forecast demographic,
socioeconomic, and exposure variables (BFP and ESF coverage) as input values. Fixed
effects are used in impact evaluations, both retrospective and forecast, because they include
a term to control for unobserved characteristics of the unit of analysis that are constant
during the study period, such as some geographical, historical, or sociocultural aspects of
each municipality [23]. Mean U5MRs and U5HRs were calculated for the whole country
and for subgroups of municipalities. A detailed description of the modelling process and its
parameters is provided in S3 Text in accordance with international reporting guidelines
(ISPOR-SMDM) [24].
Data sources
Two types of input data were introduced as parameters in the models (Table 1): the first were
municipality-specific demographic and socioeconomic variable values including their munici-
pal time trends, in addition to BFP and ESF coverage values; the second were the effect sizes of
all independent variables from regressions on child mortality (overall and from specific causes)
and hospitalisations. Demographic and socioeconomic determinants of the U5MRs and
U5HRs included in the model were as follows: mean monthly income per capita (Brazilian
reais), poverty rate (percentage of individuals with a monthly income of less than US$43), illit-
eracy rate (of those over 15 years of age), fertility rate, and percentage of the population living
in households with adequate sanitation. Values for these variables for the year 2010 were
obtained from national census data [25], and values for the years 2011–2030 were extrapolated
through exponential decay formulas using the municipality-specific changes over time from
the retrospective dataset [4]. For each variable, the parameters of the prediction formula were
calibrated comparing the forecast country-level changes over time with the country-level
changes over time estimated from the National Household Surveys for the period 2011–2015
[26]. For the two exposure variables, municipal BFP and ESF coverage, values were obtained
for 2010–2016 from the Ministry of Health’s Department of Primary Care and Ministry of
Social Development [27–29]. Forecast (2017–2030) BFP and ESF coverage data points were
simulated according to the economic crisis and policy response scenarios defined below. All
variables were modelled as continuous and successively categorised according to cutoffs used

Modelled scenarios: Economic crisis and policy response
We simulated three economic crisis scenarios using poverty rates and mean per capita income
from National Household Surveys for the years 2011–2015 and microsimulation from the
World Bank for the time periods indicated below [7]. The scenarios considered in this analysis
were as follows:
• Economic crisis scenario 1: A milder and shorter economic crisis with a smaller yearly
increase (0.55%) in the poverty rate lasting 3 years (from 2015 to 2017)
• Economic crisis scenario 2: A medium economic crisis with a larger yearly increase (0.80%)
in the poverty rate sustained over 5 years (from 2015 to 2019), the most probable at the time

 • Economic crisis scenario 3: A longer economic crisis with the same percent increase in the
poverty rate as scenario 2, but sustained over 7 years (from 2015 to 2021)
In response to the economic crisis, two policy responses were considered in the main analy-
sis, both starting from 2017 (the current year of the study):
• Fiscal austerity: This started to be implemented at the beginning of 2017. Estimates were
based on simulations of the impact of the already implemented austerity measures (mainly
EC95) on the budget for social protection and healthcare until 2030 [8,9,12]. Reductions in
BFP and ESF coverage were modelled as proportional to reductions in the budget.
• Social protection: Maintaining social assistance and healthcare coverage in response to the
economic crisis in the period 2017–2030. This response was projected as increases in BFP
and ESF coverage proportional to increases in the poverty rate and also, at the end of the eco-
nomic crisis, decreases in the BFP proportional to poverty reductions and a return to pre-cri-
sis coverage levels for the ESF.
Additionally, a broad range of economic crisis and policy response scenarios were modelled
as sensitivity analyses (see S3 Text).
Simulation of the effects on child morbidity and mortality
Using the 2010–2030 synthetic cohort of covariates and exposure variables (BFP and ESF cov-
erage)—an extension of the retrospective cohort based, as explained above, on real data—for
different scenarios, a post-sample forecasting of the U5MRs and U5HRs was performed. Fixed
effects predictors were used based on the fixed effects negative binomial regression models in
the previous retrospective impact evaluation [4]. In summary, each outcome, for a specific
year and specific municipality, was estimated as the product of the fixed effects term of the
municipality and the independent variables, with their effects expressed as rate ratios, accord-
ing to the regression model equation. A detailed explanation of the equations used is provided
in S3 Text.
U5MRs for specific causes was modelled based on estimates from the reference retro-
spective study, which showed a stronger effect of consolidated BFP and ESF coverage
(high coverage for at least 4 years) on deaths from malnutrition, diarrhoeal diseases, and
lower respiratory infections, than on deaths from other causes, with reductions in munic-
ipalities with consolidated coverage of 65%, 53%, and 20%, respectively [4], as detailed in
S3 Text.
For each outcome and each scenario, 10,000 simulations were performed using the Monte
Carlo sampling method. This allows parameter values to vary in each simulation cycle accord-
ing to their assumed underlying distribution. Mortality rates were modelled as negative bino-
mial distributions, and other parameters as normal distributions. The effects of the
independent variables—expressed as incidence rate ratios (IRRs)—were sampled from normal
distributions calibrated with the mean and 95% confidence intervals of the IRR from the retro-
spective impact evaluation. For each year and each scenario, we obtained a distribution of
10,000 possible values of the outcome (U5MR or U5HR). We estimated the mean and the con-
fidence interval using the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles from this distribution. CIs are used in
microsimulation to represent the uncertainty of the estimates [19,21].
To compare and quantify the expected differences in U5MR and U5HR for our policy
response scenarios, we estimated the rate ratios between the two scenarios for each simulation,
dividing the U5MR and U5HR in the social protection scenario by the U5MR and U5HR in
the fiscal austerity scenario, and obtained the mean IRR with CI for all the simulations. These

 comparisons were also evaluated in terms of the differences in the total number of deaths and
hospitalisations during the study period.
The models were coded and implemented in R version 3.4.0.
Stratification and inequality analysis
Municipalities were stratified based on quintiles of poverty rate in the baseline year of the sim-
ulation (2010), and comparisons between the scenarios described above were performed for
each quintile. Changes in U5MR inequalities over time across municipalities were estimated
using the U5MR concentration index by municipal poverty rate in the baseline year. Concen-
tration indices are relative measures of inequality that, within health, quantify the gradient of a
health outcome across the socioeconomic range. They are well-used measures of inequality as
they indicate the extent to which health outcomes are concentrated among the disadvantaged
(or the advantaged) [30].
Calibration and validation of the models
All model parameters were derived from a retrospective impact evaluation [4], the variable of
the model that was calibrated was the effect size of the time variable, representing secular
changes in U5MR over time. Internal validity of the model was assessed by fitting the fixed
effects negative binomial multivariate regression used in the retrospective evaluation [4] to the
synthetic dataset created for the period 2010–2030, and verifying that all the obtained coeffi-
cients were identical to those introduced as inputs in the model.
External validation of the model was undertaken by comparing the overall national U5MR
forecast by our microsimulation with the official Brazilian U5MR estimates during the years
2010–2013 [29]. These were the most accurate and up-to-date data on U5MR available. We
estimated the linear regression of predicted versus observed values and the proportion of vari-
ance (R2) explained, obtaining a beta coefficient of 0.95 and an R2 of 0.98, and we verified that
all the observed values where included in the 95% CIs of our simulation. A detailed explana-
tion of the calibration and validation process is available in S3 Text.
Sensitivity analysis
The robustness of the results was verified through multiple sensitivity analyses. First, we tested
the effect of different lengths and intensities of poverty rate increases during our simulated
economic crisis scenarios. Differential poverty rate increases according to municipal charac-
teristics at baseline (2010) were also tested, with larger increases in poverty in poorer munici-
palities and smaller increases in the wealthier municipalities. Second, a broad range of policy
responses were tested, including slower reductions in BFP and ESF coverage (less than 4%
yearly) under austerity scenarios and heterogeneous BFP and ESF reductions. Third, different
values for the effect of the time variable representing secular changes over time were tested.
We also evaluated the possibility that the fiscal austerity scenario would be able to reduce and
shorten the economic crisis, while the maintenance of social protection would extend the
period of economic crisis, comparing the two possible scenarios. All sensitivity analyses are
detailed in S3 and S4 Texts.
Results
Modelled scenarios: Economic crisis and policy response
Under all economic crisis scenarios, poverty rates are forecast to increase, and income per cap-
ita to fall, in the coming years (Table 2). In economic scenario 1 (a milder and shorter crisis),

 decreases in income and increases in the poverty rate are estimated to cease from 2018
onwards, whilst for scenario 2 (a medium crisis), this occurs 2 years later, in 2020, and in sce-
nario 3 (a longer crisis), in 2022. Other socioeconomic variables included in the analysis follow
historical changes over time, showing reductions in illiteracy, declining fertility, and improve-
ments in access to sanitation.
Fig 3 shows mean poverty rates of all municipalities (from World Bank estimates) under
economic scenarios of shorter, medium, and longer crisis and mean municipal BFP and ESF
coverage under both policy response scenarios (current fiscal austerity or maintenance of
social protection).
Values of all variables in the study period are shown in S3 Text. In all economic crisis and
policy response scenarios, mean U5MR is forecast to continue declining, although the magni-
tude of the reduction varies (Fig 4). In 2015, at the beginning of the economic crisis, we
observe a sharp slowing in the annual reduction of the U5MR (0.2% a year) in comparison
with the 2010–2015 period (0.8% a year) due to increasing poverty rates.
From 2017 onwards, the two policy responses are associated with different U5MRs (Fig 4).
Continuing austerity and the concomitant reductions in ESF and BFP coverage would slow
the decline in U5MR relative to maintaining social protection. In the scenario of a milder cri-
sis, which consequently requires smaller increases in BFP and ESF coverage under the mainte-
nance of social protection scenario, the U5MR in 2030 would be 6.98% (95% CI: 5.26%–
8.67%) lower compared to fiscal austerity, with 13,954 (95% CI: 4,559–23,418) under-five
deaths averted over the period 2017–2030. In the scenario of medium crisis, with maintenance
of social protection the U5MR would be 8.57% (95% CI: 6.88%–10.24%) lower in 2030 than
under austerity, representing a cumulative 19,732 (95% CI: 10,207–29,285) averted under-five
deaths over the period 2017–2030. In the scenario of a longer crisis, the U5MR by 2030 would
be 9.53% (95% CI: 7.92%–11.17%) lower with maintenance of social protection compared to
the austerity scenario, with 23,424 (95% CI: 13,829–32,880) averted under-five deaths over the
study period. Table 3 shows the U5MR rate ratios between the two policy responses for differ-
ent intensities and duration of economic crisis.

tract infections, in addition to overall U5HR, under a medium intensity economic crisis—the

 most probable at the time of writing (results for scenarios of shorter and longer crisis are
detailed in S4 Text).
Attenuations in annual reductions in U5MR and U5HR are observed for both policy
responses, but under the austerity scenario, increases in the U5MR are forecast for diarrhoeal
diseases and malnutrition. Under the maintenance of social protection scenario, mortality
from these causes would continue to decline, albeit at a slower rate, resulting in U5MRs in
2030 that are 39.3% (95% CI: 36.9%–41.8%) and 35.8% (95% CI: 31.5%–39.9%) lower for diar-
rhoeal diseases and malnutrition, respectively, than under austerity. For lower respiratory tract
infections, by 2030 the U5MR would be 8.45% (95% CI: 4.16%–12.01%) lower with mainte-
nance of social protection. The rate ratios for these causes of death are larger than for overall
U5MR because the effects of the BFP and ESF were larger in the retrospective analysis (see S3
Text). Annual declines in the U5HR continue under both policy response scenarios, albeit at a
slower rate under the austerity scenario. Under the policy response of maintenance of social
protection there would be a greater reduction in the U5HR, which by 2030 would be 3.07%
(95% CI: 0.99%–5.12%) lower, corresponding to 123,549 (95% CI: 21,248–226,292) averted
under-five hospitalisations over the study period 2017–2030.
Stratification and inequality analysis
Stratification of changes in U5MR by quintiles of municipal-level poverty shows that the
effects of the maintenance of social protection are greatest in the poorest municipalities
(Fig 6).
Under maintenance of social protection, the U5MR would be 11.01% (95% CI: 7.97%–
13.83%) lower than under austerity in 2030 in the first (poorest) quintile (Table 4). This com-
pares to no significant difference (between social protection and austerity) in the fifth (richest)
quintile. Concerning inequalities, while the concentration index of U5MR among municipali-
ties is not predicted to decrease under austerity (0.129 [95% CI: 0.122–0.137] in 2015 versus
0.128 [95% CI: 0.121–0.135] in 2030), under the maintenance of social protection it would be
0.111 (95% CI: 0.104–0.119) in 2030, which is 13.3% (95% CI: 5.6%–21.8%) lower than under
austerity.
Sensitivity analysis
Results on the U5MRs from diarrhoea, malnutrition, and lower respiratory infections and hos-
pitalisations are similar under the different economic crisis scenarios and have a similar dose–
response relationship with the intensity of the crisis as for overall U5MR. Alternative inequal-
ity analyses under different economic scenarios also produce similar results. Even if different
secular changes in U5MRs over time are introduced in the model, the comparison (in terms of
either the IRR or avoided deaths) between scenarios remains unchanged. Sensitivity analyses
show that varying the magnitude of BFP and ESF coverage reductions due to austerity

 measures do not affect our conclusions as all modelled reductions were associated with strong
and statistically significant child mortality impacts. Our simulation where fiscal austerity
shortened the economic crisis, while the maintenance of social protection extended it until
2030 shows that child mortality would still be 4.43% (95% CI: 2.79%–6.32%) lower in 2030
under the latter scenario.
Discussion
Our findings show that levels of child mortality in Brazil are likely to be substantially different
under a fiscal austerity scenario, modelled as a reduction in coverage of poverty-alleviation
and primary care programmes, compared with a scenario where existing levels of social pro-
tection of these programmes are maintained and provide coverage of vulnerable populations.
Our forecasts indicate that under a scenario that maintains social protection the U5MR would
be 8.6% lower in 2030 than under an austerity scenario—with a cumulative impact of almost

 20,000 averted under-five deaths over the period 2017–2030. U5MRs from diarrhoeal diseases
and malnutrition would be 39.3% and 35.8% lower in 2030, respectively, and there would be
123,000 fewer under-five hospitalisations under the maintenance of social protection. Accord-
ing to our estimates, BFP and ESF coverage reductions would disproportionately impact child
mortality in the poorest municipalities and contribute to the persistence of sizeable health
inequalities, compromising efforts towards achieving both the third and tenth SDGs.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of fiscal austerity measures
on health during an ongoing economic crisis in a middle-income country. Similar to Brazil,
many other Latin American countries are experiencing economic crises that have stimulated
policy-makers to consider fiscal austerity, potentially undermining the longstanding efforts to
strengthen their welfare states [31]. A small number of studies in high-income countries have
shown mixed results on the impact of economic crises on child health and mortality [2,3]. For
example, in Canada and Ireland no effect was detected, but in Spain recession has been shown
to affect general health and use of healthcare services in children from vulnerable groups [32].
A combination of economic crisis and externally imposed austerity measures in Greece has

 been associated with small increases in infant mortality [33]. There is less evidence available
from LMICs, although it is plausible that economic shocks may have greater impact in coun-
tries where children are more vulnerable and have less social protection than in high-income
countries [34]. Approximate estimates for the 2008–2009 crisis in sub-Saharan countries
showed an excess of 28,000–50,000 infant deaths [35], while in Bangladesh the prevalence of
wasting in children increased 6.7% following the economic crisis [36]. No studies to our
knowledge have focused on the impact of austerity measures during an economic crisis in
LMICs.
Our prediction of higher mortality from diarrhoea and malnutrition under austerity is con-
sistent with our retrospective evaluation, where the BFP and ESF had a considerably stronger
effect on mortality from these causes than on overall U5MR [4] (S3 Text), and with studies
showing that these conditions are strongly associated with poverty [37]. Few studies have
examined wider, medium-term health system impacts of austerity measures, which are likely
to be especially important if disinvestments occur in poverty-alleviation programmes and pri-
mary healthcare [38,39]. The predicted health impacts of austerity through the BFP and ESF
coverage reductions may occur through multiple ways and multiple mechanisms. Evidence
shows that the BFP improves both the quality and quantity of food for poor families [40], lead-
ing to better nutritional status of children in the poorest regions of Brazil [18], and likely
explaining reductions in U5MR [4,41]. The BFP also improves child health more directly by
promoting prenatal care for pregnant women and vaccination coverage and routine check-ups
for children as key conditions that must be fulfilled to receive funds [4,41]. Regarding the ESF,
evidence suggests that programme expansion reduces child mortality by increasing access to
prenatal care and improving vaccination coverage [15,42]. Furthermore, the ESF increases the
number of basic medical activities and domiciliary visits in its area of coverage [15], and also
reduces inequalities by exerting a greater impact in municipalities with lower Human Devel-
opment Index [42].
The main strength of this study is the use of a synthetic cohort of 5,507 municipalities built
as an extension of a pre-existing 10-year retrospective cohort used in previous impact evalua-
tions [4,15]. This synthetic cohort is able to incorporate the real correlation structure between
variables and to model real municipality-specific parameters and changes in municipal-spe-
cific variables over time, which have been calibrated with national-level data. The external vali-
dation of the models—using a different data source than the one used for the calibration
process—is another strength of the study, together with the extensive sensitivity analyses per-
formed (S3 and S4 Texts). The use of estimates of programme effectiveness coming from the
same country under study is an important advantage of the models, given that similar public
policies could be implemented differently and have different effectiveness in other countries
[23,39].
There are pertinent limitations of the study, mainly stemming from uncertainty around the
future macroeconomic scenarios in Brazil. This is due to the current unstable political and eco-
nomic situation, creating uncertainty around the forecasting of poverty rates, income, and the
other independent variables. Therefore, additional scenarios were forecast in sensitivity analy-
ses, with all—even simulation of different intensities and lengths of the economic crisis—
showing that the differences between the two policy scenarios (long-term austerity versus
maintenance of social protection) remain large and of comparable magnitude (S4 Text). We
modelled the impact of austerity on BFP and ESF coverage as there is strong evidence these
policies confer large protective effects for child morbidity and mortality [4,15,41,42], but this
study is also limited in that austerity may affect other government policies and parts of the
economy we have not considered. It is likely our estimates of the negative impact of austerity
on child health are conservative as they do not reflect public spending constraints in other

 areas, e.g., education, housing, and other welfare programmes [8,9,12]. Another limitation of
the study is our modelling of policy effectiveness at an ecological rather than individual level.
Studies evaluating mortality impacts of public policy using individual-level data are uncom-
mon—mainly due to the rarity of the outcome and the extensive follow-up time required.
Additionally, individual-level studies are not able to evaluate important spillover effects of pov-
erty-alleviation programmes in the community [4,43]. We used a measurement of the intensity
of the intervention (coverage of the BFP and ESF) specifically linked to the population group
most vulnerable to poverty-related mortality, thus reducing the possibility of changes in mor-
tality being derived from non-exposed populations [4]. Impact evaluations using ecological
panel data have been extensively used to evaluate the effectiveness of country-wide, and often
heterogeneous, implementations of public policies in Brazil, and achieve higher external valid-
ity than individual-level studies [4,15,41,42,44]. Our findings show that, even if we model that
austerity measures (EC95) will shorten the duration of the economic crisis in Brazil, its
medium and long-term effects on child mortality remain strongly detrimental.
Brazil has implemented bold policies to reduce poverty and achieve universal health cover-
age over the past 20 years [45,46], with two-thirds of the population now covered by the ESF
and one-fourth by the BFP [4,15,27,28]. These policies have contributed to important
improvements in health outcomes and have decreased health inequalities [46]. Our findings
indicate that the current economic crisis together with the package of austerity measures may
jeopardise further gains in poverty reduction and improvements in health outcomes, especially
among poor Brazilians. Ongoing monitoring of the poverty and health impacts of austerity
policies in Brazil and the extent to which these constrain achievement of key SDGs will afford
important learning for policy-makers globally.
In conclusion, the results of our study show that implementation of fiscal austerity mea-
sures could contribute to a large number of preventable child deaths and hospitalisations in
Brazil, threatening attainment of the SDGs related to child health and inequalities.
