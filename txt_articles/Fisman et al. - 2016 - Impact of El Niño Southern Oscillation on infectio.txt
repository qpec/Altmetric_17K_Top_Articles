Although the global climate is changing at an unprecedented rate,
links between weather and infectious disease have received little
attention in high income countries. The “El Niño Southern Oscilla-
tion” (ENSO) occurs irregularly and is associated with changing
temperature and precipitation patterns. We studied the impact
of ENSO on infectious diseases in four census regions in the United
States. We evaluated infectious diseases requiring hospitalization
using the US National Hospital Discharge Survey (1970–2010) and
five disease groupings that may undergo epidemiological shifts
with changing climate: (i) vector-borne diseases, (ii) pneumonia
and influenza, (iii) enteric disease, (iv) zoonotic bacterial disease,
and (v) fungal disease. ENSO exposure was based on the Multivar-
iate ENSO Index. Distributed lag models, with adjustment for sea-
sonal oscillation and long-term trends, were used to evaluate the
impact of ENSO on disease incidence over lags of up to 12 mo.
ENSO was associated more with vector-borne disease [relative risk
(RR) 2.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–8.48] and less with
enteric disease (0.73, 95% CI 0.62–0.87) in the Western region;
the increase in vector-borne disease was attributable to increased
risk of rickettsioses and tick-borne infectious diseases. By contrast,
ENSO was associated with more enteric disease in non-Western
regions (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02–1.15). The periodic nature of ENSO
may make it a useful natural experiment for evaluation of the
impact of climatic shifts on infectious disease risk. The impact of
ENSO suggests that warmer temperatures and extreme variation
in precipitation events influence risks of vector-borne and enteric
disease in the United States.

T
he global environment is changing at an unprecedented rate
and in a manner that is attributable in large part to climate
change mediated by anthropogenic “greenhouse gases” (1). Di-
rect linkage between the physical environment and infection risk
has been recognized since the time of Hippocrates (∼400 BCE)
(2, 3). Such linkages (e.g., surges in diarrheal disease and vector-
borne disease risk with changing weather patterns) are evident
in low income countries with limited health-enhancing infra-
structure (4–6). The impact of the physical environment on in-
fection risk has been less well-studied in high income countries
perhaps because of the perception that wealth, strong public
health institutions, and strong infrastructure mitigate such risks
(7). For example, Brunkard et al. evaluated dengue virus sero-
prevalence on the Texas–Mexico border and demonstrated com-
pellingly that wealth, and the infrastructure it buys, can have
important protective effects against infectious disease, even within
a given geographical area (8). However, risk mitigation is not
equivalent to risk elimination, and, as climate and weather con-
tinue to shift ever more rapidly, infectious disease control practi-
tioners in high, middle, and low income countries all need to
develop improved understanding of the impact such shifts may
have on infectious disease epidemiology.
Although it would be desirable to directly measure the effects
of long-term anthropogenic climate change on infectious disease
risk, the long time scale of these changes and their unprecedented
and global nature make the design of “controlled studies” chal-
lenging (9). The interactions between environment, ecosystems,
and disease dynamic systems are highly complex and depend on
threshold effects for disease emergence and persistence; conse-
quently, model-based projections are associated with great un-
certainty (10). The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a
major, irregular, periodic global climatic phenomenon that results
from thermal inversion in the Pacific Ocean (11). ENSO has
profound effects on weather and climate worldwide (12) and
causes regional surges in rainfall in the United States (particularly
in the “Great Basin” in the Southwest and also along the Gulf of
Mexico) (13, 14), with increased temperatures in northwestern
states (15). However, ENSO is associated with anomalous pre-
cipitation (both unusually wet and unusually dry) and tempera-
tures (warmer than usual in northern states, cooler than usual in
southern states) throughout the continental United States (14,
16), with effects predominantly on wintertime weather (14).
ENSO events may become more frequent under climate change
scenarios (17–19). Furthermore, although ENSO effects are global,
there is variability in the magnitude of impact of ENSO effects, with
some regions considered “teleconnected” to ENSO (i.e., they
experience climatic anomalies linked to ENSO anomalies despite
being many thousands of kilometers away) whereas other regions
are nonteleconnected (12, 14). As such, ENSO represents a useful
natural experiment that may be used to infer effects of altered
climatic patterns on a variety of phenomena, including conflict
(12), vegetation abundance (17), health of fisheries (20), agricul-
tural productivity (21), and infectious diseases (22).
Most attempts to evaluate ENSO effects on infectious disease
occurrence have occurred in relatively small geographic areas
(22–24) or in low or middle income countries (5, 25–27). A
systematic review of data on ENSO and health by Kovats et al.
did identify several studies in high income countries, with most of
these focusing on arboviral disease risk in Australia (28); studies
of ENSO impact on viral respiratory disease have been per-
formed in California (29), including one multicity study (24, 29),
and the impact of ENSO on plague occurrence has been evalu-
ated in New Mexico (29). As such, evaluations of the potential

 impact of ENSO on changing infectious disease dynamics across
multiple regions in high income countries remain limited.
We combined ENSO exposure data with the National Hos-
pital Discharge Survey (NHDS), a large, nationally representa-
tive, multiregional hospital discharge survey from the United
States (30). Our objectives were as follows: (i) to evaluate as-
sociations between ENSO and infectious disease hospitalization
risk in multiple US regions, and (ii) to evaluate between-region
heterogeneity in such effects and, in particular, to identify dif-
ferences in ENSO effect between the more teleconnected West-
ern region of the US and other regions.
Methods
Data Sources.
Candidate disease groupings. We identified five disease groupings of interest
that could reasonably be expected to undergo epidemiological shifts due to
ENSO, either because of profound seasonality, or because disease natural
history is dependent on animal reservoirs or vectors that are sensitive to shifts
in precipitation and temperature. The five groupings were as follows: (i) vector-
borne disease (including both arthropod-borne viral disease and tick-borne
and rickettsial diseases), (ii) pneumonia and influenza, (iii) enteric disease,
(iv) zoonotic bacterial diseases, and (v) fungal disease.
National Hospital Discharge Survey. Estimates of hospitalized case burden and
total discharge volume by month and census region were derived from the
NHDS (30), a national survey conducted on an annual basis by the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention from 1970 to 2010 (41 complete years of
data). The survey consists of diagnostic and demographic data for a prob-
ability sample of patient discharge records (31). Cases of infectious diseases
of interest were identified and grouped by month and region, based on
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM) codes outlined in Table 1. Due to the complex sampling design of
the NHDS, case counts and total discharges were estimated using included
sample weights.
El Niño Southern Oscillation indices. ENSO is a complex phenomenon manifested
by changes in sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure over the
Pacific Ocean and can be characterized using a large number of measures.
Our primary exposure of interest was the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) Multivariable ENSO Index (MEI), a widely used bi-
monthly indicator of ENSO activity that incorporates surface wind, sea sur-
face temperature, air temperature, and cloudiness data into a single index.
The MEI is scaled with values ranging from −3 (lower values consistent with
“La Niña” events) to +3 (higher values consistent with ENSO events). How-
ever, we evaluated the robustness of associations identified with MEI by
performing sensitivity analyses in which nine other potential measures of
ENSO (including monthly average sea surface temperature measurements
from several Pacific Ocean regions, the Southern Oscillation Index, Equato-
rial Southern Oscillation Index, and Oceanic Niño Index) were used as ex-
posures. These indices, and links to data sources and supporting materials,
can be found in Table S1.
Statistical Methods. Regional variation in disease incidence, temporal trends,
and confidence intervals for incidence were estimated using Poisson re-
gression models, with weighted monthly case counts as the outcome and
weighted discharge estimates used as model offsets.
The effects of ENSO on disease risk at lags of up to 12 mo were evaluated
using distributed lag nonlinear lag models (4, 32, 33). Briefly, these models
represent exposure as a two-dimensional risk plane, known as a cross-basis,
defined by level of exposure × lag (32, 33). The cross-basis can be incorporated
along with other covariates into multivariable regression models, to generate
three-dimensional estimates of risk as a function of exposure level and lag (33).
We assumed that the effects of ENSO at a given lag would be linear, but lag
structure was modeled as a cubic polynomial. ENSO effects were evaluated at
the most extreme (most “El Niño-like” value) of a given index, with the
midpoint between “El Niño-like” and “La Niña-like” values used as the ref-
erent (relative risk = 1.0) in models.
Because nonlinear trends in incidence, and significant seasonality, were
identified in initial exploratory analyses for all disease groupings, we mod-
eled long-term trends by incorporating linear and quadratic temporal terms
into models and by including fast Fourier transforms to adjust for disease
seasonality (3). Models were constructed for the following: (i) pooled na-
tional estimates, (ii) all census regions excluding the Western United States
census region, and (iii) each of the four census regions individually (North-
east, Midwest, South, and West) (34). Effects were assessed through genera-
tion of three-dimensional risk surfaces and contour plots and by estimating the
cumulative (integrated) relative risk (RR) of disease occurrence over the entire
12-mo period downstream from an ENSO-like signal (33).
Because we hypothesized a priori that ENSO effects would be stronger in
the teleconnected Western region than in other regions, we evaluated dif-
ferential effects using a “ratio of ratios” (RoR) approach, with the integrated
relative risk (RR) of disease in the Western region divided by the integrated
RR in non-Western regions. The 95% credible intervals were approximated
through bootstrap resampling of the 95% confidence limits for Western and
non-Western relative risk (RR), calculating ratios of resampled values, and
identifying the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile ranks of ratios. We performed
10,000 bootstrap replicates for each ratio. We also used the metaanalytic
Q-statistic to evaluate heterogeneity in effects between Western and non-
Western regions (35). Metaanalytic evaluations were performed, and initial
descriptive Poisson models were constructed, in Stata version 10.1 (Stata Corpo-
ration); distributed lag nonlinear lag models were constructed using the dlnm
package in R (R Project); bootstrap resampling was accomplished in Microsoft
Excel version 14.1 using the NORMINV command (Microsoft Corporation).
Results
Disease group-specific monthly rates of discharge are presented
in Fig. 1. Discharges due to respiratory illness (pneumonia and
influenza) were most frequent whereas discharges due to zoo-
noses were least frequent. Although fractions of discharges due
to these diseases varied across the four health regions, there
were no differences between regions with respect to the rank-
ordering of discharge frequency (Fig. 1).
Significant nonlinear multiyear temporal trends and significant
seasonal oscillation were observed for all disease groupings, as was
significant interregional variation in disease frequency (Table 2).
The largest between-region difference in disease burden was seen
for vector-borne disease in the Northeast region, which was 2.7
times higher than that in the referent Western region, consistent
with the known high incidence of Lyme disease in this area (36).
No trend was seen over the study period in the intensity of
ENSO indices or interval between ENSO events. At the national
level, no significant effect of ENSO was seen in any disease
grouping (Table 3). However, in analyses restricted to the
Western region, ENSO (defined as MEI = +3) was associated
with a cumulative increase in vector-borne disease risk [RR 2.96,
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–8.48] and a cumulative de-
crease in enteric disease risk (0.73, 95% CI 0.62–0.87) over the
subsequent 12-mo period (Fig. 2). By contrast, ENSO was as-
sociated with an increased risk of enteric disease in non-Western
regions as a whole (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02–1.15), an effect driven
mostly by a marked increase in risk in the Northeastern region
(RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01–1.32). Other regional effects included
decreases in zoonotic bacterial disease risk in the Midwest region
(RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13–0.97) and fungal disease risk in the South
(RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66–0.97).
The relative-relative risk of vector-borne disease in the Western
region compared with non-Western regions was 2.80, but 95%
credible intervals (0.91–8.52) overlapped the null, and a meta-
analytic Q-statistic did not provide strong evidence for heteroge-
neity (0.99 on 1 degree of freedom, P = 0.39). By contrast, the

 RoR for enteric disease in Western vs. non-Western regions did
not overlap the null (RoR 0.65, 95% credible interval 0.54–0.79),
with strong statistical evidence of heterogeneity (Q-statistic
22.48 on 1 degree of freedom, P < 0.001). No other significant
heterogeneity was seen between Western and non-Western
regions.
Exploratory analyses on Western region vector-borne disease
effects suggested that increase in risk was likely attributable to
changes in Rickettsioses and other tick-borne infections (cu-
mulative RR 3.27, 95% CI 0.98–10.91), rather than arboviral
disease (cumulative RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.03–61.38). We performed
a series of sensitivity analyses on ENSO effects using alternate
indices of El Niño (Tables S2–S7). For vector-borne disease and
enteric disease analyses, findings remained robust when alternate
indices were used, except that analyses using Nino12 (sea surface
temperature in easternmost Pacific Ocean regions) were associ-
ated with imprecise confidence intervals. Fungal disease effects
noted in the Southern region were not robust when alternate
ENSO indices were used. Zoonotic bacterial disease risk estimates
for the Midwestern region were identical in direction and similar
in magnitude to those seen in the base case analysis, but confi-
dence limits for some indices overlapped the null.
Discussion
The irregular periodicity of ENSO makes this phenomenon a
useful natural experiment for evaluating the impact of changing

borne disease is visible even on a log scale, with hospitalizations 2.7 times higher in the Northeastern region than the Western region.

 temperature and precipitation patterns on infectious disease risk
(28). Our hypothesis a priori had been that ENSO would be
associated with changes in the epidemiology of infectious dis-
eases in the more teleconnected Western US region than in
other regions. Indeed, we did observe a large (but imprecise)
impact of ENSO on vector-borne disease risk in the Western
region of the United States, without changes in disease burden in
other regions. The impact of ENSO was concentrated at a lag of
10–12 mo and seemed to be largely on tick-borne disease. This
finding is consistent with potential effects of precipitation and
elevated temperatures on tick vectors as well as increased rodent
disease reservoirs (37–40) although such observations have not
been universal (41).
However, our findings on enteric disease risk were more
complex. We identified heterogeneous effects of ENSO on risk,
with an unexpected decrease in enteric disease risk in Western
regions, but an increase in risk in other regions taken together. If
this finding is valid, it yields a key insight into the potential im-
pact of environmental impacts on infectious disease risk: A given
environmental change may result in different effects on disease
risk in different ecosystems. It has been noted that both unusually
wet and unusually dry conditions may enhance enteric disease risk
(42). In the Southwestern United States, major metropolitan
areas are dependent on reservoirs and aquifers (43, 44), which
may be depleted in drought conditions, with concentration of
nutrients and pathogens; by contrast, other regions that depend
more heavily on surface waters may be vulnerable to runoff that
attends heavier rainfalls. Although we have regarded Western
regions as teleconnected to ENSO and used non-Western regions
as controls, ENSO has impacts on the weather across the conti-
nental United States, and, as such, the effects we observe are
plausible. Furthermore, there is dissociation between regionally
predominant ENSO effects and the boundaries of US census
regions used in this analysis; the Northwestern United States
experiences less precipitation under ENSO influence whereas the
Southwestern United States experiences heavier precipitation
(13, 14); because these regions are aggregated in our analysis, it is
difficult to determine the precise mechanism whereby ENSO
would change risk.

The 3D risk surfaces for ENSO and disease in the Western Region. Strong ENSO signals are associated with a surge in risk of vector-borne disease at a
12-mo lag, whereas the same signals are associated with a decrease in enteric disease risk at 12- and 2- to 6-mo lags. Multivariate ENSO Index values are
plotted on the x axis (+3 = more El Niño-like), whereas lag (months) is plotted on the y axis and relative risk on the z axis. Note the difference in z axis scales
between the two plots.

Fisman et al.
 Similarly, the regional impacts on zoonotic bacterial disease
and fungal disease risk that we observed in Midwestern and
Southern regions could represent true effects although the latter
effect was not robust in the face of sensitivity analyses. Given
strong precipitation effects (positive and negative) associated
with ENSO across the US Gulf Coast and Ohio River Valley
(13), it should be clear that our consideration of only Western
regions as ENSO-teleconnected represents a heuristic approach.
Further verification and characterization of effects we report will
require analyses at more localized geographic scales that will
make it possible to identify specific environmental contributors
to risk, as well as interaction between multiple exposures at
different lags.
Furthermore, the absence of other clear effects of ENSO on
disease risk for other disease groupings could reflect a true ab-
sence of effects, could reflect lack of statistical power to find such
differences, or could represent nondifferential misclassification of
exposure due to the large geographic regions under study and
dissociation between boundaries of ENSO effects and census re-
gions. Notably, we failed to identify impacts of ENSO on pneu-
monia and influenza risk, in contrast to the work of Choi et al.,
who found ENSO to be associated with attenuation of influenza
risk in California (24). Our use of hospitalized case data means
that we are of necessity studying only a small subset of disease
cases of interest, all of which are more likely to have been man-
aged in the outpatient setting or to have involved not seeking
medical care at all (45).
Finally, it is important to note that our study focuses on changes
in risk of diseases, most of which are endemic, rather than emer-
gence of novel infectious diseases. Climatic change could favor the
emergence of novel infectious diseases, by shifting communicable
disease reproductive numbers past threshold values that permit
disease emergence, allowing imported infectious diseases to be-
come endemic rather than undergo stochastic extinction (46). Some
infectious diseases [e.g., legionellosis (47) and West Nile virus in-
fection (48)] either were initially recognized or truly emerged in
North America, during the period under study. However, the lack
of microbial specificity in our dataset and the relative rarity of such
events limit our ability to study the impact of climate on disease
emergence using the approach outlined above.
We identified impacts of ENSO on infection risk, with the
implication that ongoing climate change may also impact in-
fectious disease epidemiology in the United States. The magni-
tude and direction of such effects may be regionally variable.
This finding highlights the importance of better understanding
the linkages between environment and infection risk in high in-
come regions and the need for investment in robust public health
surveillance systems that are able to detect changing disease
burdens. The transdisciplinary nature of the questions begged
by our analysis can be answered through collaboration between
data scientists and modelers and across the disciplines of ep-
idemiology, ecology, and climate science.
