The influenza endonuclease is an essential subdomain of the viral
RNA polymerase. It processes host pre-mRNAs to serve as primers
for viral mRNA and is an attractive target for antiinfluenza drug
discovery. Compound L-742,001 is a prototypical endonuclease in-
hibitor, and we found that repeated passaging of influenza virus in
the presence of this drug did not lead to the development of resistant
mutant strains. Reduced sensitivity to L-742,001 could only be induced
by creating point mutations via a random mutagenesis strategy.
These mutations mapped to the endonuclease active site where
they can directly impact inhibitor binding. Engineered viruses con-
taining the mutations showed resistance to L-742,001 both in vitro
and in vivo, with only a modest reduction in fitness. Introduction of
the mutations into a second virus also increased its resistance to
the inhibitor. Using the isolated wild-type and mutant endonucle-
ase domains, we used kinetics, inhibitor binding and crystallogra-
phy to characterize how the two most significant mutations elicit
resistance to L-742,001. These studies lay the foundation for the
development of a new class of influenza therapeutics with reduced
potential for the development of clinical endonuclease inhibitor-
resistant influenza strains.

nfluenza A viruses cause disease in a variety of species in-
cluding humans (1). Seasonal influenza viruses infect 5–20% of
the human population annually, and studies using data collected
during the 1990s estimated that an average of 36,000 influenza
related mortalities occurred each year in the United States alone
(2). Vaccines are currently the first line of defense against sea-
sonally circulating influenza viruses, and given their relative
effectiveness, it is perhaps not surprising that innovative antiin-
fluenza drug discovery has not been considered a high priority by
government or commercial interests. However, vaccine efficacy
is limited by changes in the circulating viruses and by waning
protection in the elderly (3, 4). Seasonal vaccines are also pre-
dicted to have limited efficacy against zoonotic strains that
represent a serious and ongoing threat to human health. The
recent 2009 pandemic showed that effective matching vaccines
are unlikely to be available during the first wave of a pandemic
(5). There have been four influenza pandemics within the past
100 y, including the devastating H1N1 outbreak in 1918 (6) and
the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 (7). Although zoonotic avian viruses
of the H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8 subtypes
have failed to spread in humans, fatality rates have approached
60% for some of these outbreaks (8, 9). Mutations that can fa-
cilitate human transmission of these zoonotic viruses are being
identified (10, 11).
Subtype independent antiviral drugs represent excellent alter-
native antiinfluenza therapies. Historically, the development of
effective antiviral therapies has been successful for the treatment
of diseases caused by the HIV (12) and the Hepatitis C virus
(HCV) (13). Considering that HIV and HCV diseases were con-
sidered to be “untreatable” in the not so distant past, the current
treatment regimens are remarkably effective and can even lead to
complete cures in the case of HCV. An attractive antiinfluenza
drug target is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
that synthesizes both genomic RNA and viral mRNA (14, 15). The
recently determined crystal structure of the heterotrimeric com-
plex comprising subunits PA, PB1 and PB2 has provided key in-
sights into its mechanism (16, 17). Early work to identify RdRp
inhibitory compounds established that the endonuclease activity is
an attractive target for influenza drug development (18). Trans-
lation of viral mRNAs by the host ribosome requires that they be 5′
capped, and this is achieved in cells infected with influenza virus by
a “cap-snatching” mechanism in which the endonuclease cleaves 5′
caps from host mRNAs, which then act as transcription primers
(19). The endonuclease domain occupies the N-terminal half of PA
(PAN) (20, 21) and contains a two-metal (Mn2+) active site that
preferentially cleaves the pre-mRNA substrate at the 3′ end of a
guanine located 12 nucleotides from the 5′ cap (22). The active site
is well conserved (23), and crystal structures have revealed how it
Significance
The endonuclease domain within the influenza virus hetero-
trimeric replication machinery is essential and represents an
attractive drug target. It is important to understand the struc-
tural basis of potential inhibitor resistance, to design appro-
priate inhibitors and to prioritize drug candidates that are
unlikely to cause the rapid development of clinically-relevant
resistance mutations. Using a prototypical endonuclease in-
hibitor (L-742,001), we used mutagenesis to select for replica-
tion competent resistant mutants and studied the structural
and functional basis for the observed resistance. These studies
confirm that the endonuclease domain is an excellent drug
target for treating influenza. They also provide reagents (mu-
tant viruses and constructs) and crucial pharmacophore knowl-
edge that will aid in the development of new drug candidates
for urgently needed influenza therapies.

 engages the centrally bound nucleotide of the substrate (24). Recent
studies revealed how inhibitory compounds engage the active site
(24–26).
In the case of HIV and HCV, the development of single-agent
drug associated resistance via Darwinian selection was observed
early in the drug discovery process. The error-prone nature of
influenza viral replication can likewise rapidly generate point
mutants for the selection of resistance that have seriously com-
promised the efficacy of influenza therapeutics (27). Here we
have investigated this phenomenon with respect to compounds
that target the influenza virus endonuclease domain. We used
the inhibitor L-742,001, a 4-substituted 2,4-dioxobutanoic acid
that effectively inhibits viral growth in both cell culture and
mouse models (18, 28, 29). We recently confirmed that L-742,001
inhibits the activity of the isolated endonuclease domain and
structurally characterized its binding at the active site (26). Here,
we demonstrate that resistant mutations do not emerge by simply
passaging the virus repeatedly in the presence of the compound.
Viruses with reduced sensitivity were only observed after ran-
domly introducing mutations into the endonuclease domain and
then selecting for viable strains in the presence of the inhibitor.
Four mutations within the endonuclease active site are able to
generate resistance while maintaining viral fitness. These results
confirm that L-742,001 indeed targets the endonuclease within the
intact virus and reveal that resistance does not emerge unless the
mutational landscape for selection is artificially increased.
Results
Selection of Variants Resistant to L-742,001. L-742,001 has a trefoil-
like structure and is therefore an ideal molecule to probe the
resistance landscape of the rather large endonuclease active site
locale. L-742,001 (26) and related compounds (24) engage the
central two-metal core and interact with many of the surrounding
residues. We initially attempted to obtain resistant variants by
passaging wild-type A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (henceforth PR8) virus
in the presence of L-742,001 with a gradual increase in inhibitor
concentration (10 μM, 20 μM, and 40 μM). After ten passages
followed by whole virus genome sequencing, we found only one
mutation within the PB2 gene, but viruses containing this mu-
tation remained susceptible to L-742,001 at levels similar to that
of the wild-type virus (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig. S1). As-
suming that this approach was too inefficient to generate the
necessary pool of selectable mutations, we expanded the diversity
by randomly introducing mutations into the endonuclease coding
sequence (nucleotides 1–588 of the PA gene) to create a library
of “PAN-rm” plasmids in the reverse genetics vector pHW2000.
We sequenced 24 clones from this library and about 42% con-
tained mutations that lead to the truncation of the PA ORF. The
remaining clones had between 0 and 11 mutations distributed
throughout the domain showing that our approach provided good
coverage across the region of interest. This plasmid library was
cotransfected with the remaining seven PR8 genes to generate a
large pool of PAN-rm viruses. Five hundred microliters of this pool
was then passaged in MDCK cells in the presence of L-742,001 to
select for resistant viruses. After three to four passages, the PA
genes from resistant viruses were sequenced from all replicates.
The sequencing revealed the following point mutations resulting
from single nucleotide changes; I79L, E119D, and T20A-F105S.
Functional Impact of the Resistance Mutations. To ensure that all
subsequent experiments were conducted with clonal isolates, six
PR8 viruses containing wild-type PAN and PAN with mutations
T20A, I79L, E119D, F105S, or T20A-F105S were generated by
reverse genetics (30), and these were compared for susceptibility
to L-742,001 in vitro. We first monitored their growth properties
in MDCK cells in the presence or absence of 10 μM L-742,001
(Fig. 1). Wild-type PR8 showed a dramatic reduction in viral
growth (4–5 log10TCID50/mL decrease in viral titers) in the
presence of inhibitor at all time-points. However, the T20A,
I79L, and F105S mutants were only mildly affected by the in-
hibitor (2–3 log10TCID50/mL decrease) and the growth of the
E119D and T20A-F105S mutants was completely unaffected by
the inhibitor at all time-points. IC50 values derived from a plaque
inhibition assay showed a similar trend (Table 1). In the absence
of inhibitor, there was no significant difference in fitness between
the wild-type and mutant viruses (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Fig.
S2A). To determine their in vivo viral fitness, 104 PFU of the wild-
type and mutant viruses were inoculated into mice. Mice infected
with wild-type virus lost weight from 2 d post inoculation (dpi) (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3A) and succumbed to infection within seven dpi (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3B). Mice infected with the five mutant viruses all
showed similar patterns of weight loss and survival (SI Appendix,
Fig. S3 A and B). The mouse LD50 values (LD50) of the mutants did
not significantly differ from those of the wild-type virus and ranged
between 2.2–2.7 MLD50 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). Although there
were small but significant titer differences between viruses over the
course of the study, all viral lung titers peaked between 3 and 5 dpi
(6.1–7.3 log10TCID50 per g) and were maintained until 7 dpi (more
than 5.5 log10TCID50 per g) (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). To confirm that
all mutations were maintained during replication in vitro and
in vivo, and that no additional changes had taken place during the
experiments, cell supernatants and mice lungs at the last time point
were collected and sequenced (SI Appendix, Table S2).
To directly assess the impact of the identified resistance mu-
tations on polymerase activity, we used a luciferase-based mini-
genome assay (31). Similar to the results from the viral growth
and plaque inhibition assays, the T20A, I79L, and F105S muta-
tions increased resistance to L-742,001 by a modest two- to
fivefold compared with wild type whereas E119D and T20A-
F105S showed significantly higher resistance values of 29.4- and
10.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 2A). The polymerase activities of the
mutant viruses in the absence of L-742,001 were all maintained
at above 80% of the wild type (Fig. 2B).
Phenotypically important mutations in influenza viruses can be
genetically context dependent and have different effects in dif-
ferent viruses. To address this issue with the L-742,001 resistance
mutations, we introduced I79L, F105S, and E119D into a pan-
demic H1N1 2009 (A/Tennessee/1–560/2009) virus (pH1N1
henceforth). This virus naturally possesses an alanine at position
20 within the endonuclease domain that was shown to be asso-
ciated with decreased susceptibility to L-742,001 (29). Consistent
with this observation, wild-type pH1N1 virus showed a 7.8-fold
higher IC50 to L-742,001 than the wild-type PR8 virus (Table 1).
The introduction of the three mutations I79L, E119D and F105S
increased resistance 2.8-, 4.2-, and 9.7-fold, respectively (Table 1).

Impact of endonuclease resistance mutations on the growth of the
PR8 influenza virus. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10−4 of wild-type (A)
and PR8 mutant (B–F) viruses was used to infect MDCK cells in the presence
(red) or absence (blue) of 10 μM of inhibitory compound L-742,001. Super-
natants were collected at 8, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h post inoculation and viral
titers determined on MDCK cells by using the Reed–Muench 50% endpoint
method (47). Virus titers are displayed as log10 50% tissue culture infectious
doses (TCID50). The limit of virus detection was 1.8 log10 TCID50 per mL. Error
bars represent SEM derived from three independent experiments. The Stu-
dent’s t test was used for statistical comparisons (*P < 0.05; ns, not significant).

 Similar to the PR8 virus, there was no significant difference in
fitness between the wild-type and mutant viruses in the absence of
inhibitor (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B).
Kinetic and Structural Analyses of the Wild-Type Endonuclease.
Studies by others (24) have shown that the endonuclease do-
main from pH1N1 yields superior crystal structures of inhibitor
complexes than the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) strain that we
previously studied (26). Having demonstrated that the selected
resistance mutations are also effective in the pH1N1, we switched
to this strain for our kinetic, binding and structural analyses of the
resistance mutants. We specifically used the PAN domain from
A/California/04/2009, which is genetically very similar to A/Tennessee/
1–560/2009, and created the construct PAN
ΔLoop. This construct is
similar to that previously studied (24) apart from a nonessential
flexible loop (residues 51–72) that was deleted in our previous
studies (26). Crystals of this construct routinely produced apo and
complex structures at 2.3 Å resolution or better (SI Appendix,
Tables S3–S5).
Using a previously developed FRET-based assay (20, 32), we
first confirmed that PAN
ΔLoop has a robust nuclease activity. Fig.
3A shows the Michaelis–Menten curve using 200 nM of protein,
and SI Appendix, Fig. S5A shows the full kinetic analysis from
which Vmax and KM values of 3764190 s−1 and 1566 nM, respec-
tively, were derived. We then measured the binding of our fluo-
rescent probe (25) to PAN
ΔLoop by fluorescent polarization, and
the Kd was found to be 44 nM (Fig. 3B). We also used L-742,001
to remove the prebound probe (Fig. 3C) and measured IC50 and
Ki values of 0.89 μM and 0.34 μM, respectively.
Finally, we structurally characterized the interaction of PAN
ΔLoop
with the mononucleotides dTMP and rUMP (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6), and with L-742,001 (Fig. 4 A and D). The mononucleotides
bind in the same manner as previously reported (24) with the
phosphate group interacting with the paired Mn2+ ions and the
base engaging the side chains of Tyr24 and Lys34. L-742,001
engages the active site in the same manner as the related com-
pound R05-2 (24), with the p-chlorobenzene arm forming a
stacking interaction with Phe105 and the phenyl arm engaging
Ala20, Tyr24, and Ile38. This is a key result because our pre-
viously reported L-742,001 complex structure using the endo-
nuclease from H5N1 showed significant differences (26).
Kinetic and Structural Analyses of the Resistant Endonucleases. The
I79L mutation generated minimal resistance to L-742,001 in
both the PR8 and pH1N1 strains and we therefore focused on
the F105S and E119D mutations. These were individually in-
troduced into the PAN
ΔLoop construct that naturally contains
the T20A substitution. The kinetic assay revealed that F105S is
only marginally impaired compared with the wild-type enzyme
whereas E119D is seriously impaired (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
Fig. S5 B and C). The Vmax values were calculated as 2854244
and 537470 s−1 (76% and 14%, respectively, of the wild-
type values). The KM value for F105S was slightly increased
(2645 nM) but we were unable to estimate the KM for E119D.
Binding studies using the fluorescent probe (Fig. 3B) also showed
the greatest effect with E119D. The Kd with E119D (949 nM) was
∼20 times larger than that of the wild-type protein, whereas the Kd
value for F105S was largely unaffected (22 nM). The IC50 and Ki
values for F105S derived from the probe displacement assay (Fig.
3C) were similar to the wild-type (1.49 μM and 0.39 μM, re-
spectively), but much higher with E119D (7.08 μM and 1.98 μM).
We then addressed the impact of the F105S (Fig. 5A and SI
Appendix, Fig. S7A) and E119D (Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Fig.
S7B) mutations on the PAN
ΔLoop structure. Both structures are
very similar to the wild-type structure, but a significant difference
in the E119D protein is the loss of an active site Mn2+ ion. The
“proximal” Mn2+ ion coordinated by His41, Asp108, Asp119,
and Ile120 is present, but the “distal” Mn2+ coordinated by Glu80
and Asp108 is missing. The crystal structures of F105S and E119D
in complex with mononucleotides were also determined. F105S in
complex with dTMP and rUMP are identical to the wild-type
complexes with both Mn2+ ions present (Fig. 5C and SI Appendix,
Fig. S7 C and E). However, the two E119D complexes showed
significant differences (Fig. 5D and SI Appendix, Fig. S7 D and F).
Although the rUMP complex is very similar to that of the wild
type, the distal Mn2+ ion only became visible in the presence of 10-
fold higher concentrations of metal (50 mM MnCl2 and MgCl2)
and substrate (200 mM rUMP). In the dTMP complex, the distal
Mn2+ ion is never present and the nucleotide phosphate group
compensates by moving to displace a water molecule and form
a hydrogen bond with the main chain amino group of Val122.
Perhaps as a result of this movement, the base no longer engages
Tyr24 but moves to occupy a different pocket surrounded by
Lys34, Ala37, Val122, and Arg124.
The crystal structures of the mutant proteins in complex with
L-742,001 were also resolved. Although the inhibitor is clearly
present in both structures, no electron density was observed for
the phenyl arm, presumably due to free rotation of this group.
The electron density for the phenyl arm was not seen even at higher
concentrations of the inhibitor in the crystallization solution. In the

PHARMACOLOGY
 F105S complex (Fig. 4 B and E), the loss of the Phe105 side chain
removes the key stacking interaction with the p-chlorobenzene arm
that relocates to a new position adjacent to Lys34. In the E119D
complex (Fig. 4 C and F), the p-chlorobenzene arm occupies the
wild-type location adjacent to Phe105, but the phenyl arm remains
disordered despite its binding pocket adjacent to Tyr24 being
available. The reason may be a decrease in the binding affinity of
Mn2+ ions leading to destabilization of the stacking interaction of
the phenyl group with Tyr24. In the case of the E119D complex
with rUMP, both Mn2+ ions were only observed at a 10-fold higher
concentration of MnCl2 and MgCl2. The apparent ease by which
the two similar arms of L-742,001 can rotate and occupy different
pockets within the open active site in response to these mutations
while maintaining the interaction of the diketo moiety with the two-
metal site may explain why the compound adopts a different con-
formation in pH1N1 (Fig. 4B) compared with H5N1 (26).
Discussion
Current antiinfluenza drugs target the M2 ion channel (aman-
tadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase (zanamivir and
oseltamivir), but the rapid emergence of resistant strains has
severely reduced their clinical usefulness (33, 34). Structural
studies have now revealed new opportunities for drug discovery
that target the essential endonuclease activity of the virus (24–
26). In the current study, we had two primary goals; to confirm
that the known endonuclease inhibitor L-742,001 targets the
enzyme within the intact virus by generating resistant mutants,
and to survey the resistance potential of the endonuclease by
characterizing the sites of mutation. We failed to generate viable
resistant viruses using traditional in vitro approaches, but succeeded
by developing a directed mutagenesis approach. Four resistance
mutations were identified, T20A, I79L, F105S, and E119D, and all
map to the endonuclease active site thereby confirming it as the
target of L-742,001. These mutations partially overlap with those
identified in an earlier L-742,001 study (35), and elicited resistance
in both of the influenza strains tested.
Structural analyses of the wild-type and mutant pH1N1 en-
donuclease domains with and without bound L-742,001 revealed
how these mutations compromise drug binding. Phe105 interacts
with the p-chlorobenzene arm of L-742,001, and its mutation to
serine presumably reduces the binding affinity. The resistance
effect of F105S in strain PR8 is increased by the additional T20A
mutation. T20A may not be a bona fide resistant mutation be-
cause over 98% of deposited sequences harbor this variation (SI
Appendix, Table S6). Nonetheless, alanine provides a selective
advantage when L-742,001 is present and T20A was also iden-
tified in the earlier studies (35). This residue is located on the
opposite side of the active site to Phe105, and they may act in
concert to influence the positioning of the p-chlorobenzene and
phenyl arms of L-742,001 (Fig. 4A). Glu119 contributes to the
coordination shells of the two Mn2+ ions, directly to the proximal
Mn2+ ion and indirectly via a water molecule to the distal Mn2+
ion. The mutation appears to adjust the two-metal coordination
geometry and weaken the binding of the distal Mn2+. The distal
and proximal Mn2+ ions are coordinated by two and four side
chains, respectively, which explains their different binding affini-
ties (24). As regards the I79L mutation, this residue is adjacent to
the two-metal locale and can potentially impact its conformation.
The two major resistance mutations that we identified were
F105S and E119D. F105S is the weaker of the two in terms of its
impact on the binding of L-742,001 and its sensitivity to in-
hibition by the compound. F105S is also the least catalytically
impaired enzyme, consistent with its lack of interaction with the
mononucleotide at the active site (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). E119D
generates the least active enzyme, consistent with its role in
coordinating the proximal Mn2+ ion, and the aspartic acid re-
placement is clearly unable to efficiently fulfill this role. Sur-
prisingly, these two mutations had a less than anticipated impact
on viral replication in cells and mice, although the more de-
fective E119D did have the lowest titers at the conclusion of both
infection experiments (Fig. 1E and SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S4).
Thus, the compromised endonuclease activities of F105S and
E119D when measured with PA in isolation are less apparent in
terms of viral fitness in the absence of L-742,001. During in-
fection, both mutations evidently permit adequate levels of cat-
alytic activity for viral replication while selectively disfavoring
inhibitor binding. One explanation, supported by the polymerase
assay (Fig. 2B) and the structure of the heterotrimeric (16, 17), is
that the mutations have less effect in the context of the intact
RdRp complex where the RNA substrate is also bound by the
CAP-binding domain.

 Overall, our studies support the notion that the endonuclease
domain is an attractive target for influenza antiviral drug discovery.
Although we were able to generate resistant viruses synthetically, it
was not possible to induce resistant mutations to L-742,001 in wild-
type virus even after 10 passages in the presence of the compound.
In contrast, viruses resistant to adamantanes and neuraminidase
inhibitors can be readily generated using this approach (36–40).
Although it is encouraging that resistance appears difficult to gen-
erate naturally, the relatively minor impact on viral fitness of the
F105S and E119D mutations does raise caution as to whether re-
sistant viruses would have the capacity for community spread if they
were to develop under extended drug pressure. Tempering this
concern is the fact that Phe105 and Glu119 are highly conserved
and account for greater than 99.5% of all human and avian in-
fluenza viruses (41) (SI Appendix, Table S6), suggesting that these
residues have a selection pressure acting upon them that favors their
retention. The evolution of viral strains is a complex process, and it
is well established that even a modest reduction in the relative fit-
ness of a mutation can lead to the extinction, or near extinction, of a
less fit mutant viral strain (42). Thus, the slightly reduced replication
of viruses containing E119D might be critical in the context of
competition with wild-type strains when drug pressure is removed.
Similarly, the use of more sensitive fitness models, such as
ferret transmission, may identify fitness costs of the F105S
substitution that we were unable to detect here. Regardless
and reflecting the importance of our studies, the FDA has
provided guidelines on the preclinical and clinical monitoring
of influenza drugs that are under development in regard to
potential resistance development (www.fda.gov/downloads/
drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/
ucm091219.pdf). These guidelines also suggest that the future
treatment of influenza will benefit from a “mixture” of drugs
targeting multiple therapeutic vulnerabilities of influenza. Combi-
nation drug treatment has been highly effective in the clinical man-
agement of HIV and hepatitis C (12, 13).
L-742,001 was ultimately found to be unsuitable for drug devel-
opment. However, with the availability of effective endonuclease
assays and high resolution crystal structures, there have been nu-
merous reports of novel chemotypes that inhibit this enzyme and an
upsurge in accompanying medicinal chemistry (43–46). Our studies
have revealed some of the structural origins of how resistance can
emerge, and this information can now guide medicinal chemists in
their optimization of new inhibitor scaffolds and prioritization of
early lead compounds. For example, inhibitors that make critical
contacts around Phe105 and Glu119 should not be highly ranked in
the lead optimization process. In this way, the identified resistance
mutations can be used to guide future drug discovery efforts and to
design and select compounds that are less prone to the develop-
ment of drug resistance. In addition, our approach of using random
mutagenesis to identify resistance mutations and then introducing
them into intact viruses and expression constructs for screening will
be invaluable to all researchers in field of antiviral drug discovery.
Experimental Procedures
Additional experimental procedures are available in SI Appendix.
Random Mutagenesis. The coding region of the 196 residue PR8 virus endo-
nuclease domain within the RdRp PA subunit gene was randomly mutated
using the GeneMorph II EZClone Domain Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the
resulting PCR-based plasmid library was transformed into competent cells
(DH5α, Invitrogen). Mutations within the library were confirmed by sequenc-
ing representative clones. Three plasmid libraries were generated and in-
dependently used to rescue viruses.
Selection of Resistant Variants and Reverse Genetics. PR8 variants containing
random mutations in the PA endonuclease domain were generated as de-
scribed (30). Variants that displayed growth in the presence of high doses of
the compound were sequenced within the endonuclease domain of the PA
gene. The identified mutations were then introduced into the wild-type PA
gene by site directed mutagenesis. The same mutations were also introduced
into the TN09 virus. Reverse genetically generated wild-type viruses (PR8 and
TN09) were used as the control in each case. All rescued viruses were sequenced
to confirm that there are no additional mutations elsewhere in the genome.
Viral Polymerase Inhibition Assay. vRNPs, NP-, PA-, PB1-, and PB2-pHW2000 were
cotransfected with the firefly luciferase reporter and a β-galactosidase plasmid
into 293T cells using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) and the manufacturer’s protocols. For
inhibition of polymerase activity by L-742,001, 0–400 μM of the compound were
added at 6 h after transfection. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C, luciferase activity
was determined (Promega) and normalized against the β-galactosidase activity
level of the cells. The IC50 was calculated as the compound concentration
causing 50% reduction of luciferase signal using Prism software (Prism 5.0).
Viral Growth Kinetics in Vitro. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10−4 of PR8
variants and wild-type were infected to MDCK cells to compare their growth
kinetics. Supernatants were collected at 8, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h post in-
oculation for virus titration and endpoint-titrated by the 50% tissue culture
infectious doses (TCID50) of viruses in MDCK cells (47). The limit of virus de-
tection was 1.8 log10 TCID50/mL and Student’s t test was used for statistical
comparisons (P < 0.05) and calculated by using Prism 5.0.
In Vivo Characterization. Groups of 20 6-wk-old female BALB/c mice were
lightly anesthetized by isoflouran and inoculated intranasally with 104 PFU
of viruses. Virus infected mice were monitored for up to 13 d for weight
change and mortality, and three mice from each group were euthanized at
1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 dpi for lung viral titrations. The mice lungs were subjected to
titer by TCID50/mL in MDCK cells. When the mice lost 25% or more of their
initial body weight, they were euthanized. The LD50s in mice (MLD50s) were
determined in 10-fold serial dilution groups (102 to 106 TCID50 per 50 μL) (47).
Cloning, Overexpression, and Protein Purification. A loop-deleted version of
PAN from pandemic H1N1 influenza virus A/Tennessee/1–560/2009, in which
residues 51–72 were replaced with the three-residue linker sequence GGS,

structure is shown in gray/blue, amino acids in stick representation with green
carbons, water molecules as red spheres, and metal ions as teal spheres. In C and
D, the two substrate-bound structures are superimposed. The amino acids with
green carbons correspond to the rUMP (peach carbons) complex structure, and
those with pink carbons correspond to the dTMP (also pink carbons) complex. In
the F105S complexes (C), the structures are almost identical apart from the ori-
entation of Tyr24. In the E119D complexes (D), there are substantial differences
between the two structures. Hydrogen bonds and metal coordination are dis-
played by dashed lines. The electron densities are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S7.

 was cloned with a C-terminal 10xHis tag as described earlier (26). We refer to
this construct as PAN
ΔLoop. Two derivative clones containing the point mu-
tations F105S and E119D were created by site-directed mutagenesis. The
three proteins were expressed using BL21(DE3) cells, and purified by affinity
chromatography and gel filtration. For E119D, it subsequently proved nec-
essary to move the 10xHis tag to the N terminus.
Nuclease Activity and Fluorescence Polarization Binding Assays. We followed
previously developed procedures for both assays. For the FRET-based activity
assay, the substrate is 5′-Cy5-GAATACTCAAGCTATGCATC-3IAbRQSp (20, 32).
Details of our fluorescent binding probe and the fluorescent polarization
assay have been described (25).
Crystallographic Analyses. Crystallization screening was carried out at 18 °C
using the Phoenix crystallization robot (Art Robbins Instruments). Crystals of
the various complexes were obtained by soaking apo crystals in mother
liquor supplemented with the ligand and MnCl2/MgCl2. Diffraction data were
collected from cryo-protected crystals at the SERCAT 22-ID or 22-BM beam
lines at the Advanced Photon Source. Data sets were indexed, integrated, and
scaled using HKL2000 (48), and the structures were determined by molecular
replacement and refined using the CCP4 suite (49). Model building and re-
finement was conducted using Coot (50). For data collection and refinement
statistics, see SI Appendix, Tables S3–S5.
