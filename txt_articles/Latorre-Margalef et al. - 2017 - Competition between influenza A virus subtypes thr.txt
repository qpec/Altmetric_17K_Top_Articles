Abstract
Our overall hypothesis is that host population immunity directed at multiple antigens will
influence the prevalence, diversity and evolution of influenza A virus (IAV) in avian popula-
tions where the vast subtype diversity is maintained. To investigate how initial infection
influences the outcome of later infections with homologous or heterologous IAV subtypes
and how viruses interact through host immune responses, we carried out experimental
infections in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Mallards were pre-challenged with an
H3N8 low-pathogenic IAV and were divided into six groups. At five weeks post H3N8 inoc-
ulation, each group was challenged with a different IAV subtype (H4N5, H10N7, H6N2,
H12N5) or the same H3N8. Two additional pre-challenged groups were inoculated with
the homologous H3N8 virus at weeks 11 and 15 after pre-challenge to evaluate the dura-
tion of protection. The results showed that mallards were still resistant to re-infection after
15 weeks. There was a significant reduction in shedding for all pre-challenged groups
compared to controls and the outcome of the heterologous challenges varied according to
hemagglutinin (HA) phylogenetic relatedness between the viruses used. There was a
boost in the H3 antibody titer after re-infection with H4N5, which is consistent with original
antigenic sin or antigenic seniority and suggest a putative strategy of virus evasion. These
results imply competition between related subtypes that could regulate IAV subtype popu-
lation dynamics in nature. Collectively, we provide new insights into within-host IAV com-
plex interactions as drivers of IAV antigenic diversity that could allow the circulation of
multiple subtypes in wild ducks.

 Author summary
Many features of pathogen diversification remain poorly explored although host immu-
nity is recognized as a major driver of pathogen evolution. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) can
infect many avian and mammalian hosts, but while few IAV subtypes circulate in human
populations, subtype diversity is extensive in wild bird populations. How do these sub-
types coexist in wild avian populations and do they compete within these natural host
populations? Here we experimentally challenged mallard ducks with different IAVs to
study how an initial infection with H3N8 determines the outcome of later infections
(duration of infection and virus load) and antibody responses. There was complete protec-
tion to re-infection with the same H3N8 virus based on virus isolation. In addition, there
was partial protection induced by H3N8 pre-challenge to other subtypes and development
of heterosubtypic immunity indicated by significantly shorter infections and reduction in
viral load compared to controls. This indicates that subtype dynamics in the host popula-
tion are not independent. Amongst H3N8 pre-challenged groups, the highest protection
was conferred to the H4N5 subtype which was most genetically related to H3N8. The
H4N5 challenge also induced an increase in H3 antibody levels in that challenge group
and evidence for original antigenic sin or antigenic seniority. Thus, previous infections
with IAV can influence the outcome of subsequent challenge with different IAV subtypes.
These results not only have relevance to understanding naturally occurring subtype diver-
sity in wild avian populations but also in understanding potential outcomes associated
with introduction of novel viruses such as highly pathogenic IAV H5 viruses in wild bird
populations.
Introduction
Diversification is a common feature in pathogen populations and this often involves the evolu-
tion of antigenic variants [1]. Examples of this exist in various pathogen systems: viruses (influ-
enza A virus, Dengue virus, Bluetongue virus, and rotaviruses), bacteria (Borrelia spp, Neisseria
meningitis, and Pneumococcus) and protozoan parasites (Plasmodium spp. and trypanosomes).
Antigenic variation within specific hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes is
well described with influenza A viruses (IAVs) as this is an important consideration in devel-
oping vaccines and vaccination strategies associated with seasonal influenza viruses in humans
and IAV affecting domestic livestock and poultry. Though multiple IAV subtypes circulate in
these host systems, antigenic interactions between these subtypes are equally important but
less understood. Shared epitopes between different HA subtypes associated with the HA stalk
have been described and these may be important target epitopes for universal IAV vaccines.
Immunity to these shared epitopes also may provide partial protection in subsequent infec-
tions with heterologous IAV [2] and could potentially influence clinical outcome and regulate
subtype diversity in host populations through competition [3].
IAV have the capacity to infect many different hosts, from birds to mammals; however
the vast majority of influenza subtype diversity is found in wild birds, especially waterfowl,
gull, and shorebird populations where low-pathogenic IAV (LPIAV) representing 16 HA and
9 NA subtypes are maintained [4]. In these wild bird populations, many HA/NA subtype com-
binations co-circulate and it is notable that their abundance and relative diversity appears to
vary over time and space [5–7]. In addition, individual birds are often co-infected or sequen-
tially infected with multiple IAV subtypes in a given season or year [8, 9] and naturally infected

 heterosubtypic cross-immunity [9]. Experimental infections have demonstrated that initial
infection with a specific IAV induces immune responses and protection against infection with
homologous strains [10]. Additionally, initial viral infections could induce a partial protection
to heterologous subtypes in experimental settings [10–13] and several studies have shown that
LPIAV pre-exposure protects against a lethal highly pathogenic IAV (HPIAV) challenge [11,
14, 15]. Despite these observations little is known about the mechanisms, extent (strength and
specificity) and persistence of these immune responses and the outcomes of re-exposures that
have critical significance to understanding the maintenance of IAV antigenic diversity in
multi-strain/subtype-pathogen systems such as occur with IAV and ducks.
In this study, mallards were pre-challenged with a strain of H3N8 LPIAV, one of the most
common subtypes in waterfowl, and pre-challenged ducks were subsequently re-challenged
with the same strain (homologous challenge) or with different strains representing various
subtypes (heterologous challenges). Groups of ducks in the homologous challenge were
exposed at different time intervals to evaluate long-term antibody responses and potential pro-
tection as well as to further investigate the potential influence of age [16]. The different strains
used in the re-challenge were chosen to represented a gradient in the degree of phylogenetic
relatedness between the HA and belonged to subtypes commonly found in waterfowl
populations.
The objective of the present study was to experimentally mimic re-exposures that com-
monly occur in mallards and other ducks in nature to determine the effects of subsequent chal-
lenge on susceptibility, duration and intensity of viral shedding and to characterize the
humoral immune response.
Results
Variation in virus load and duration of shedding
Homologous challenge.
Mallards were initially inoculated at 4 weeks of age with LPIAV
H3N8 (pre-challenge) and all were susceptible to infection and shed virus. The study design
can be found as supporting information (S1 Table). Virus shedding was evaluated using an
AIV Matrix Real-time Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RRT-PCR) protocol [17] and the PCR
cycle threshold (Ct-value) was used as a proxy for virus load. Virus replication occurred in all
the control groups for the H3N8 re-challenge where Ct-values were lowest in cloacal (CL) sam-
ples at 2 days post infection (dpi) (Fig 1), indicating a peak in virus load/shedding; as also seen
in Fig 1, Ct-values thereafter increased over time showing that virus load/shedding decreased
(Fig 1). None of the swabs from H3 pre-challenged groups were positive by virus isolation
after the homologous re-challenge; however, some swabs tested positive by Matrix RRT-PCR
(Fig 1; there were 12, 3, and 4 positive samples in the 5-, 11-, and 15-week re-challenge groups,
respectively). In all cases (5-, 11-, and 15-week re-challenge), Ct-values were higher in pre-
challenged birds than in controls indicating that pre-challenged birds shed fewer virus copies
than naïve birds when challenged with the same strain.
The variation in Ct-values between groups was evaluated using Generalized Additive
Mixed Models (GAMM) as described later in the methods section. The variables included in
the models were: treatment group (pre-challenged or control), dpi and the interaction between
both variables. A random effect was included for individual due to the repeated sampling of
the same individuals over the course of infection. Model selection and comparison of the mod-
els were performed based on Akaike Information Criterion [18] corrected for small sample
size (AICc). The best models with the lowest AICc score and tables with p-values are presented
in S2–S4 Tables for all groups (5-, 11-, and 15- week re-challenges). Significant effects of group
(p-value = 0.04) and dpi (p-value < 0.001) were observed for the 11- week group (S3 Table).

 Best models for the 5- and 15- week groups included effects of group (p-value = 0.001 and
0.06) and a significant interaction between dpi and group (p-value = 0.02 and 0.029) (S2 and
S4 Tables).
In order to estimate the total shedding, the Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated
(based on 40 minus the Ct-value). The AUCs were significantly lower for the pre-challenged
groups for all three time intervals compared to controls (5- week interval 6.62 ± 0.71 compared
to 101.19 ± 6.99 for controls, 11- week 6.38 ± 2.69 compared to 53.05 ± 7.1 for controls, 15-
week 4.96 ± 3.19 compared to 45.25 ± 4.64 for controls) (Krustal-Wallis test [hereafter K-W],
p-values < 0.001) (S1 Fig and S5 Table). In all groups, oropharyngeal (OP) shedding was gen-
erally lower than CL shedding (S2 Fig). Individuals did not show overt symptoms of disease
and all gained weight throughout the trial.
Based on comparisons of viral shedding of H3N8 during primary challenge (H3 pre-chal-
lenge and control groups), younger individuals (4 and 9 weeks of age) had significantly lower
Ct-values (higher viral shedding) than older individuals (19 weeks) (Fig 1, S6 Table). Based on
the best GAMM model by AICc, there were significant differences in Ct-values as a function
of dpi and age group (S6 Table). Comparison of the AUC also showed significant differences
in the total shedding between the age groups (mean and SE for the pre-challenge: 72.74 ± 5.22;
9 weeks of age: 101.19 ± 6.99; 15 weeks: 53.05 ± 7.1; 19 weeks: 45.25 ± 4.64) (K-W p-
value < 0.001; S5 Table). The mean duration of infection for H3N8 in controls was 4.8 to 8.4
days (primary infections) (Fig 2, S5 Table) and there was a significant difference in the dura-
tion of infection between age groups (K-W p-value = 0.02) where the duration of infection was
shorter for older birds.
Heterologous challenge: Subtype interaction.
All birds were susceptible to H3N8 infec-
tion in the pre-challenge and all were already negative by virus isolation on CL swabs on 21
and 35 dpi, prior to transfer to poultry isolators for the re-challenge trial. All viruses used in
the re-challenge replicated in control birds as detected by virus isolation and RRT-PCR, except
for the H12N5 strain (therefore data from the H12N5 groups could not be used for compari-
son, results for this group are shown in S2 Fig). For the H4N5, H10N7 and H6N2 viruses, Ct-
values in H3 pre-challenged groups were high and higher than in the control groups indicating
a reduction in virus replication and partial protection compared to controls (Fig 3). There
were significant differences in Ct-values between the pre-challenged group H3N8 x H4N5
group and the H4N5 controls and best GAMM model included significant effects of dpi (p-

 value < 0.001), group (p-value = 0.022) and the interaction between dpi and group (p-
value = 0.049), which means a difference in clearance rate for the different groups (S7 Table).
For the H3N8 x H10N7 and H3N8 x H6N2 groups, the best models indicated significant dif-
ferences in Ct-values when compared with their respective controls and both dpi (p-
values < 0.001) and group (p-value = 0.001 and 0.024) had significant p-values (S8 and S9
Tables). Summaries of the model selection (AICc, ΔAICc, AICc weights) and significance p-
values are provided as supplementary material (S7–S9 Tables). If differences in Ct-values from
pre-challenged and controls are translated into log scale (as a difference of 3.3 Ct-values is
equivalent to one log) the reduction in shedding ranges between 0.70 and 4.75 logs depending
on the groups which corresponds to logs of Matrix RNA gene copies.

 Further, the AUC estimates also showed significant differences for total shedding between
pre-challenged and controls (mean and SE for the groups after challenge with: H4N5
8.63 ± 3.46 and 64.21 ± 9.3, H10N7 30.78 ± 7.62 and 66.57 ± 2.49, H6N2 36.76 ± 7.58 and
86.5 ± 2.58) (K-W p-values < 0.001) (S3 Fig and S5 Table) and support differences in shedding
intensity with a lower shedding in pre-challenged groups.
Mean duration of infection (as determined by detectable viral shedding, S5 Table) in the
control groups at 9 weeks of age was 8 days (SE 0.66, range 7–8.8 days) while in the pre-chal-
lenged groups the mean duration of shedding was 2.6 days (SE 0.63) ranging from 0 days in
the homologous challenge to 2.4 days (SE 1.6) for H3N8 x H4N5 group with only two individ-
ual birds infected (two CL samples), to 3.6 days for the H3N8 x H10N7 group (SE 0.98) where
all individuals were infected (nine CL isolates recovered), and 5 days for H3N8 x H6N2 group
(SE 0.58) where all individuals were also infected (nine CL isolates). There were no differences
in the duration of shedding between the different subtypes (K-W p-value = 0.83) on the naïve
control groups. There were significant differences in the duration of infection between pre-
challenged groups (K-W p-value = 0.034) (Fig 4).
Interestingly, total shedding (AUC) and duration of infection were significantly correlated
(for both homo- and heterologous challenge groups) (Pearson’s correlation coefficient
r = 0.92, df = 11, p-value < 0.001, regression n = 13, r2 = 0.86, p-value < 0.001) (Fig 5).
To test if genetic distance between HA subtypes was an important determinant in the
strength of protection, the relationship between HA amino acid sequences and reduction of
infection was evaluated. There was a negative correlation between the amino acid distance and
the relative reduction in duration of infection per group ranging from 100% to 21.4% depend-
ing on the subtype in the re-challenge (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = -0.98, df = 2, p-
value = 0.014, regression n = 4, r2 = 0.97, p-value = 0.014),) (Fig 6).
Infectivity: Variation in Ct-values and virus isolation.
We evaluated the factors that
influenced isolation success of Matrix RRT-PCR positive samples using Generalized Linear
Mixed Models (glmer function) including individual as random effect (S10 Table). There was
a significant negative relationship between isolation and Ct-values (slope = -0.41 ± 0.005;
Wald score [z] = -76.4, p-value < 0.001). As anticipated, samples with high Ct-values tended
to have a lower isolation success that those with low Ct-values (high number of viral RNA cop-
ies). Remarkably, there were significant negative relationships in the model for both the H3N8
pre-challenge treatment (whether samples derived from primary or secondary infections)
(intercept difference = -1.85 ± 0.005; Wald score [z] = -365.5, p-value < 0.001) and dpi (slope
= -0.32 ± 0.005; Wald score [z] = -63.5, p-value < 0.001). This indicates that the probability of
detecting IAV in RRT-PCR positive samples by virus isolation varies related to infection his-
tory and the days since infection. This was not dependent on sample type (CL or OP) (S10
Table).
Serology
Long-term persistence of antibodies in the homologous challenge.
All individuals were
seronegative to IAV prior to infection and seroconverted as measured by NP-ELISA on 14 dpi
after pre-challenge and all but one also had H3 specific antibodies as measured by micro neu-
tralization (MN) using the homologous antigen. NP-antibodies and H3 specific antibodies
were detectable 5 weeks after initial H3N8 infection. There was no boost in the H3 antibody
response in the 5- week interval group (5.82 ± 0.85 compared to 5.92 ± 0.5, paired t-test p-
value = 0.326). For the 11- and 15- week challenge groups, there was a slight decrease in anti-
body titer over time with a boost and a significant increase in the H3 specific antibody
response following re-challenge (tested differences in H3 MN titers before and after re-

 challenge: 11- week 6.12 ± 0.66 compared to 8.50 ± 0.58, paired t-test p-value = 0.003; 15-
week 6.32 ± 0.31 compared to 7.70 ±0.36, paired t-test p-value = 0.032) (Fig 7, panels a and c
and S11 Table with mean H3 log2 titer and SE).
Antibody responses to heterologous challenge.
All individuals tested by IAV NP-ELISA
were seronegative prior to infection. Individuals pre-challenged with H3N8 seroconverted on
both NP-ELISA and H3 MN by 14 dpi. Based on the NP-ELISA response there was an increase
in S/N ratios in all groups after the secondary challenge including the group challenged with
H12N5 (Fig 7, panel b). There were no differences in H3 MN titers between groups of birds
assigned to the different heterologous groups after initial H3N8 infection (K-W p-
value = 0.261, 14 dpi) and prior to secondary infection (K-W p-value = 0.242, 35 dpi) (mean
H3 titers and SE are presented S11 Table). An increase in the H3 MN titer was observed in the
H3N8 x H4N5 challenge group because of an increase in the H3 MN titer for 3 individuals
though there were no significant differences (6.32 ± 0.63 at 0 dpi and 7.32 ± 0.63 at 14 dpi,
paired t-test p-value = 0.200) (Fig 7, S11 Table); antibodies to H4 were also detected (Fig 8).
Similarly the group H3N8 x H10N7 did not show a significant increase in the H3 MN titer
(4.57 ± 0.22 at 0 dpi and 5.66 ± 0.51 at 14 dpi, paired t-test p-value = 0.997). To evaluate the

 variation in H3 MN titers between H3 pre-challenged groups and the influence of time (i.e.
prior to and after re-challenge) we used as before GAMM models. The best model included a
significant effect of dpi (p-value = 0.02, S12 Table). All groups and most individuals developed
detectable antibodies against the challenge subtype used in secondary challenges (Fig 8). MN
results from sera collected at the termination of the experiment using a panel of H1-H15 pro-
totype strains are shown in Fig 8. Most individuals had antibodies specific to the HA subtypes
they were challenged with; however, one sample in the homologous group (5 week interval)
was detected MN positive to H1N1.
Discussion
Homologous challenge
Here, we studied the persistence of protection to homologous IAV challenge by initially infect-
ing mallards with H3N8 and re-challenging three groups with the same virus at different time
intervals. The initial H3N8 induced long-term protection against homologous re-infection for
up to 15 weeks post-challenge, which is much longer than expected. None of the re-challenged
birds, regardless of time interval, shed virus as determined by virus isolation and that was true
for all age groups and time intervals. Although some RRT-PCR positives were detected in re-
challenged individuals, the Ct-values were high and significantly higher than in control groups
indicating a low number of RNA copies possibly associated with non-infective virus. The
observed protection and detectable antibody response is inconsistent with results from previ-
ous studies that concluded that infection conferred no protection against re-infection and that
detectable antibody responses in ducks were short-lived [19, 20]. It was considered that anti-
body responses may not be detectable or protective due to the truncated structure of some of

 the IgY forms. A possible explanation of this inconsistency is that these truncated antibodies
neutralize IAV but lack Hemagglutinin Inhibitory (HI) activity and the proportion between
these forms vary over time being the truncated from most prevalent later in the immune
response [21]. Our results are in agreement with other studies in both ducks and gulls that
reported partial to complete protection against re-infection depending on the viruses, time
between infections, host species and age and detection method [10, 22, 23]. The long-term per-
sistence of antibodies after natural infection, artificial challenge or vaccination has been
reported in captive birds up to 6 to 9 months post-exposure [24–26] though it is not know
which parameters (i.e. HI or MN titers) are correlated to protection. When examining patterns
in H3N8 infections for the different age classes in the naïve controls, all individuals were sus-
ceptible and competent to infection. The duration of infection and viral load in controls varied
according to age and birds of 5 and 9 weeks of age experienced the highest replication based
on AUC and duration of infection. This is consistent with earlier findings and indicative of
older birds being more resistant to infection and having shorter infections [16]. This age effect
could influence subsequent transmission risk and subtype diversity in cases were subtypes dis-
play seasonal patterns.
Heterologous challenge
Results from IAV heterologous challenge experiments of ducks, geese and gulls have reported
varying levels of partial protection upon re-challenge (11, 29, 30, 35). Such protection has also
been reported from field-based studies [9, 27] and from experimental work where birds were
challenged with HPIAV and effects could be measured by morbidity/mortality responses[11,
Fig 6. Correlation between amino acid distance between hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes in infections
and the relative reduction in the duration of infection (mean and SE). This demonstrates that the
reduction in duration of infection in the re-challenge is correlated to the similarity between HA involved in the
challenges.

 14]. It has also been reported that the order in which IAV subtypes are used to challenge the
host is important. For instance, H3 appears to be poorly immunogenic and less protective as a
primary infection compared to H4 that induced a stronger protective response [13]. The varia-
tion in reported protection from previous studies may be the result of asymmetric responses

 associated with strain or subtype specific variation that may be dependent on the virus causing
primary infections [12, 13, 28].
We observed a partial protection to re-challenge in the individuals subsequently infected
with heterologous subtypes indicating development of heterosubtypic cross-immunity by
H3N8. When assessing the outcome of re-challenge there was a significantly lower viral load
and shorter duration of infection in CL samples for all the groups pre-challenged with
H3N8 compared to the naïve controls. This shorter period of detectable viral shedding is in
agreement with estimates from the field [29, 30] and was observed for all re-challenged
viruses.
The extent of partial protection, as measured by a decrease in duration of detectable viral
shedding following re-infection was influenced by the genetic relatedness of the HA. This sug-
gests immune mediated competition through cross-reactive responses [31, 32] and this could
be related to both acquired humoral and cell mediated mechanisms [33]. Broadly neutralizing
antibodies have been defined across HA groups [34] and within HA group [35, 36] that target
conserved epitopes in the stalk [37, 38]. HA stalk antibodies are boosted upon re-infection and
it is therefore thought that cross-reactive anti-stalk as well as anti-NA antibodies [39] can
diminish the severity of disease in re-infections. Studies in humans have found consistent pat-
terns of cross-immunity within HA group with increased severity of the disease in cohorts
exposed with an HA of the opposite group during childhood when studying age-specific mor-
tality caused by 1918 H1N1 and by HPIAV H5 and H7 [40, 41]. It has been proposed that
extinction of influenza strains in humans could be driven by population immunity by HA
stalk and NA antibodies [39] through competitive exclusion between strains [3]. Moreover,
initial infections with a specific virus increases the probability of later infections by viruses

 from a different HA clade and group in wild mallards [9]. Comparable processes are likely act-
ing in the avian IAV system where lineage replacement with strains from different continents
has been reported [42, 43]. Theory predicts that antigenic variants tend to organize as discrete
non-overlapping strains [1] in populations where cross-reactivity between viruses induces
competition (i.e. case of H13 and H16) contrasting to the situation where cross-reactivity
induces enhancement or facilitation, like Dengue, and variants may be antigenically clustered
[44]. Here, after the heterologous re-challenge mallards shed viruses even if they were able to
clear infections rapidly. An implication of this is the potential for selective processes like viral
escape and antigenic drift to act in the same way as leaky vaccines [45, 46] which in turn could
drive antigenic evolution as observed for H5N1 HPIAV [47] or similarly for seasonal H3N2 in
humans [48]. Indeed, the estimates of divergence for some HA subtype indicate that diver-
gence is relatively recent [40].
Infectivity
Isolation success from RRT-PCR positive samples from secondary infections (re-challenge),
as expected, was correlated with Ct-value, but was significantly lower compared to isolation
results from primary infections in controls. This discrepancy has implications when inter-
preting field data and assigning infection states based on molecular diagnostics rather than
virus isolation as uncertainty needs to be incorporated [49] and may explain why isolation
rates from PCR positive samples often vary. This relationship also corroborates findings
from the field where samples from adults have a lower isolation success than samples from
juveniles [50] and where RRT-PCR positive samples used in experimental trials have not
infected ducks [51]. It is therefore prudent to be cautious when using transformations of Ct-
values (proxy for RNA copies) to EID50/ml or TCID50/ml by a standard curve based on a
virus grown at optimal conditions such as cell culture or embryonated eggs as infectivity in
hosts varies according to several parameters (age of host, previous exposure, specific virus
and infection dose. . .).
Antibody dynamics
Antibody levels (NP and H3 MN) after H3N8 infection decreased over time but most indi-
viduals remained positive for the duration of the experiment (15 weeks); all birds remained
protected against homologous challenge. There was a significant boost in the antibody
responses after homologous challenge for the long-term groups (11 and 15 weeks) but not
for the group re-infected after 5 weeks where a rapid blocking of the infection may not have
activated antibody recall. Additionally, the hyperimmune sera after homologous challenge
did not cross-react with other IAV subtypes, except for one individual positive by H1 at a
low titer of 20.
The heterologous re-infections resulted in a boost in the NP-antibody responses in all H3
pre-challenged groups. Interestingly most of the individuals had neutralizing antibodies
against the HA antigens they had been exposed to. This also includes the H12N5 that repli-
cated poorly but resulted in serological imprinting in three of the five individuals per group.
Additionally no cross-reactivity to other subtypes was observed when tested by MN with a
panel of HA (H1-H12 and H14-H15). H3-specific antibodies were detected by MN after
H3N8 primary infection and persisted in the majority of individuals until the end of the
experiment. There were interesting H3 patterns of antibody dynamics for the H3N8 X H4N5
group that showed a boost in H3 titer (Fig 7) consistent with original antigenic sin (OAS);
H4 antibodies were also detected in this challenge group (Fig 8). This phenomenon of inter-
ference was first described after sequential influenza re-infections in humans [52, 53]. Older

 individuals can have a broader immunity through repeated exposure with highest titers to
the strains individuals were exposed to early in life. These “senior strains”, are a singularity
known as antigenic seniority or imprinting [40, 54]. Currently, we report OAS in avian hosts
and between different HA subtypes (H3/H4 and possibly for H3/H10), however we expect
that phenomenon could also arise between other IAV subtypes. Thus the order in which
individuals are challenged with a specific virus could influence the future recognition of
viruses and the specificity of the responses that ultimately shapes the outcome of later expo-
sures in life. Since population immunity influences the emergence and spread of new strains
and can influence vaccination success, it is critical to have a better understanding of these
processes in different host species. We need to increase our understanding of cross-reactivity
patterns and boost dynamics in re-infections to ultimately predict risks of IAV spread into
different host populations in a context of non-naïve populations, for instance by using anti-
body landscapes [55].
The high degree of heterosubtypic immunity and subsequent competition found between
common HA subtypes from ducks indicates that the transmission success and perpetuation of
any subtype is dependent on the other viruses in the population and may explain the cyclic or
chaotic nature in the prevalence of some subtypes. Partial immunity or complete immunity
induced by pre-infection may reduce transmission potential in subsequent infections but also
may promote the high degree of IAV antigenic diversity observed in wild avian populations.
This competition may also result in subtype succession over time, like the predominance of
H3 and H4 in fall migration [5–7] and spring blooming of other subtypes within Group 2 such
as H7 or H10 [56]. With equal strength of HA immunity to all subtypes the present antigenic
diversity found in wild birds would be unlikely. Surprisingly, the results from H13 and H16
experimental infections in black-headed gulls showed limited cross-immunity between sub-
types and suggest independent cycles for these viruses [22].
However, for some strains or subtypes, cross-immunity may not be the only factor explain-
ing their dynamics in the pathogen population. Pathogen fitness or success is usually measured
by transmission risk that could be based on different transmission parameters such as the
duration of infection and pathogen load [57] as well as how long viruses could remain infec-
tious in the environment [58, 59]. We believe that virus fitness linked to host-specificity and
functionality of IAV proteins [60] is also playing an important role as evidenced by the fact
that the H12N5 IAV used in this study did not successfully replicate in mallards even though it
was isolated from that host.
A possible interpretation of these results is that population immunity can reduce the proba-
bility of transmission and potential introduction success of exotic antigenic variants [61]. Pre-
vious studies have reported protection to HPIAV induced by pre-exposure to LPIAV strains in
different bird species [11, 14]. In the context of H5N8 HPIAV clade 2.3.4.4 or other HPIAV
the present results suggest that cross-immunity could also reduce viral shedding and contrib-
ute to stopping the spread of specific virus in wild ducks that have naturally been exposed to
LPIAV [62–64].
We believe that the competitive processes described here and in other studies occur in
nature; however, in natural host populations the complexity of the system increases due to the
extensive subtype diversity of co-circulating viruses that these birds are continuously exposed
to. Based on our results we propose that the extent of competition at individual level through
host immunity could be determined by many different interacting parameters: the strains
involved in infections, the exposure history (or boost responses like OAS) and likely time
between exposure/s (assuming that immune memory decreases over time). These are many of
the same factors that are considered in evaluating immune responses and protection against
influenza in humans and domestic animals.

 Material and methods
Virus selection, stock preparation and titrations
All LPIAV viruses used in these trials represented common North American subtypes and
were originally isolated from wild mallards in Minnesota, USA [6]. Viruses included: A/Mal-
lard/MN/AI07-4724/2007 (H3N8), A/Mallard/MN/AI11-4213/2011(H4N5), A/Mallard/MN/
AI11-4982/2011(H6N2), A/Mallard/MN/AI11-4412/2011(H10N7) and A/Mallard/MN/AI11-
3866/2011(H12N5). Virus stocks were propagated by a second passage in specific pathogen
free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). Stocks were endpoint titrated using the Reed and
Muench Method [65] in ECE to determine the median egg infectious dose (EID50/0.1 ml).
Ducks were inoculated with 0.1ml at an approximate dose/dilution of 106.0 EID50/0.1ml;
the inoculum was split between intranasal and oropharyngeal routes. Previous work has
shown that different routes of infection (intranasal, intratracheal, intraocular, intracloacal, or
intra-ingluvial) result in 100% infection and similar shedding patterns [66]. Based on back
titration, the titers of the inocula, expressed in EID50/ 0.1 ml, were 105.8 for H3N8 pre-chal-
lenge, 106.5 for H12N8 and H6N2, 106.4 for H3N8 (5 week challenge), 106.8 for H10N7, 106.0
for H3N8 (11 week challenge), 106.2 for H4N5 and 106.3 for H3N8 (15 week challenge).
The HA and NA segments of the isolates were amplified [67] and later sequenced
using Sanger method. Geneious (version mac6_4_8_0_4) was used for sequence alignments
and to calculate amino acid distances. Sequences are publicly available in GenBank
(KX814369-KX814375).
Ethics statement
All procedures were in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and US regulations. All
protocols for raising, infecting, and sampling mallards were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Georgia (UGA; AUP#: A2013 05-
021-Y1-A1).
Experimental infections
One-day-old mallards (Murray McMurray Hatchery, Webster City, IA, USA) were raised in
captivity at the animal resources facilities of the College of Veterinary Medicine, UGA. Food
and water were supplied ad libitum. All individuals were identified with bands and unique ID
numbers. Individuals did not exhibit behavioral changes or overt symptoms of disease during
the duration of the trial. All birds gained weight before and throughout the challenge studies.
At four weeks of age, 40 ducks were moved to Biosafety Level (BSL) 2+ facilities and were pre-
challenged with the H3N8 LPIAV.
The study design included re-challenges with homologous and heterologous viruses (S1
Table). Prior to the re-challenges, ducks were randomly divided into groups (five individuals
per group, approximate ratio 1:1 females: males) and were moved into BSL 2+ poultry isolators
at the Poultry Diagnostic Research Center, Athens, GA, USA that are intended to house up to
five adult size mallards. After 2 days of acclimation, the re-challenge was conducted as previ-
ously described [12]. Each pre-challenged group had a control group (i.e. age matched naïve
individuals). Ducks were humanely euthanized at the end of all challenge trials at 14 dpi fol-
lowing protocols approved at the UGA. For the homologous challenge, one group of five
ducks was challenged with the same H3N8 at five weeks after the initial H3N8 pre-challenge
and two additional groups were re-challenged with the H3N8 virus at weeks 11 and 15 post-
H3N8 inoculation. Groups in the heterologous challenges were inoculated five weeks after ini-
tial H3N8 infection with subtypes representing different levels of relatedness between the key

 antigenic proteins HA and NA of the H3N8 used in the pre-challenge: H4N5, H10N7, H6N2
and H12N5.
Sampling, extraction and virus isolations
Swabs were collected from the cloaca (CL) and oropharynx, (OP) and were placed in separate
tubes containing 2 ml BHI transport media supplemented with antimicrobials [12]. Swab sam-
ples were collected on 0–8, 10, 12 and 14 and 21 (only after H3N8 pre-challenge) days post
infection (dpi) and kept cold until transfer to the laboratory where they were stored at -80 C˚
until processing.
Virus isolations was performed on swabs from all birds during all challenges on 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,
10, 12, 14 dpi as previously described [68] using two 9 to 11 days-old SPF ECE. To insure that
all birds were IAV negative before any bird movement or subsequent challenge, all birds were
tested by virus isolation on 21 dpi after the H3N8 pre-challenge and on 0 dpi prior to all subse-
quent viral challenges.
RNA extraction and RRT-PCR
Viral RNA from samples collected on 1 to 14 dpi were extracted using the MagMAX-96 AI/
ND Viral RNA Isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) on the Thermo Electron KingFisher
magnetic particle processor (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) [68]. Nega-
tive (BHI media) and positive (diluted isolate) controls were included in each extraction.
Molecular detection of the IAV Matrix gene by Real-time Reverse Transcriptase PCR
(RRT-PCR) [17] was conducted with the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA,
USA) and the Cepheid SmartCycler System (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) [68]. Negative
and positive controls were used on the extraction step and an IAV Matrix gene transcript
(National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, IA, USA) was included as positive control in
the RRT-PCR. Ct–value stands for the cycle threshold when there is initial detection of the
fluorescence signal at the beginning of the exponential phase of DNA duplication and is pro-
portional to the initial number of RNA copies in a sample. Ct-values were therefore used as a
proxy for viral load (S4 Fig). By using the same detection protocol and stock of the Matrix
gene transcript (NVSL, Ames, IA, USA) it was previously established that Ct-values signifi-
cantly correlate with the number of Matrix RNA gene copies when diluting the Matrix gene
RNA transcript to generate a standard curve [57]. Samples with cycle (Ct) values lower than 40
were considered positive
Serology
Serum samples were collected from the right jugular vein and transferred into serum separator
tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), centrifuged upon arrival
to the lab and serum was stored at -20 C˚ until analysis. Serum samples were taken immedi-
ately prior to H3N8 pre-challenge and prior to all subsequent challenges as well as at 14 dpi
and between challenges for the homosubtypic long-term groups. Serum samples were tested
with a commercially available nucleoprotein (NP)-ELISA kit (bELISA; FlockChek AI Multi-
S-Screen antibody test kit; IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA). Specific antibodies
against the different HA subtypes used in the trial were detected using a virus microneutraliza-
tion (MN) assay in Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells (MDCK; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) as
described previously [61]. Sera were additionally tested using the same viruses used for inocu-
lation in the challenge and with prototype strains for H1-H12 and H14-H15 [69] (S1 Appen-
dix) to detect cross-reactivity. These antigens also were prepared in MDCK and tests were run
using an antigen concentration of 100 TCID50 /25 μl.

 Statistical analysis
All analyses were run on the R software [70] using the GAMM, nlme and lme4 packages.
Model selection was done using AIC [18] corrected for small sample size (AICc) within the
package AICcmodavg. To evaluate the viral shedding or load, Ct-values from the Matrix
RRT-PCR runs that are proportional to the RNA copy numbers from original samples were
used. First, we analyzed the variation in Ct-values in pre-challenged and naïve controls for the
different treatment groups with different time periods between infections. The strategy was to
use linear models and include individuals as random effect using mixed models (package
GAMM) due to repeated sampling of the same individuals over the course of infection. The
models that were evaluated included the factors: dpi, treatment group, both factors and the
interaction. Ct-values from 1 dpi were not included in the analysis as they likely represented
residual inoculum rather than true virus replication (at 1 dpi the Ct-values were close to 40).
Models including the random effect of individual and the additive effect of dpi were tested but
the increased complexity of the models was penalized based on the AICc and some of them
had convergence problems. In the same way, the variation of Ct-values from all H3N8 control
groups including age as factor was assessed. For the heterologous re-challenge, the variation in
Ct-values from control and pre-challenged groups for each of the different viruses was evalu-
ated as described before. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated by using the Ct-val-
ues after subtracting them from the cut-off value of 40 as previously done [22]. The total
duration of infection or shedding was estimated by counting the days between inoculation and
last positive virus isolations in CL swabs (which also includes cases of intermittent shedding).
Birds that died or were euthanized before 14 dpi were not included in analysis. AUC and dura-
tion of infection between groups was compared using Krustal-Wallis test.
To study the correlation between AUC and duration of infection the Pearson correlation
test was performed followed by a linear regression. To explore the relation between HA simi-
larity and the degree of protection, we estimated the amino acid distance between the H3 and
the different HA of re-challenges and the relative reduction in the duration of infection within
groups. The amino acid distance was then correlated with the reduction in shedding per group
where the mean and SE were estimated using a bootstrapping approach.
Next, to explore the influence of different variables on isolation success (binomial response:
successful or unsuccessful) we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) as in [50].
The explanatory variables included in the models were: Ct-value, sample type (OP and CL
swabs), dpi and treatment (pre-challenged or naïve individuals which means samples from a
primary or secondary infection). Additionally, since individual birds were re-sampled and
samples are not independent we added the individual as a random effect in the models. Inter-
actions were not included to avoid convergence problems.
Last, MN antibody titers (as log2 transformed) at a single day of sampling were compared
between groups using the Krustal-Wallis test and the paired t-test was used to compare values
in two different days within groups. Samples with an MN titer lower than 20 were arbitrarily
given a titer of log2 (2.5) for the model testing. The variation in antibody titers to H3 by MN
was explored based on the different sampling occasions (dpi) and groups also using General-
ized Additive Mixed Models in the package GAMM.
One duck died (12 dpi in group H6N2) and swabs were already IAV negative; necropsy
showed no gross lesions caused by LPIAV. Another duck was euthanized due to difficulty walk-
ing which was associated with husbandry in captivity (6 dpi in group H3N8 X H6N8). These
birds were not included in the analysis. The H3N8 x H12N5 group was not included in the anal-
ysis because of poor replication of this virus in the pre-exposed and naïve groups. All relevant
data are available as Supporting Information files (Supplementary tables and S1 Dataset).
