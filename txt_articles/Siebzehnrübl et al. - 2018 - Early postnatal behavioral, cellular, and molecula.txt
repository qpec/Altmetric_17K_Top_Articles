Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenera-
tive disorder caused by expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene
(HTT). Although mutant HTT is expressed during embryonic develop-
ment and throughout life, clinical HD usually manifests later in adult-
hood. A number of studies document neurodevelopmental changes
associated with mutant HTT, but whether these are reversible under
therapy remains unclear. Here, we identify very early behavioral,
molecular, and cellular changes in preweaning transgenic HD rats
and mice. Reduced ultrasonic vocalization, loss of prepulse inhibition,
and increased risk taking are accompanied by disturbances of dopa-
minergic regulation in vivo, reduced neuronal differentiation capacity
in subventricular zone stem/progenitor cells, and impaired neuronal
and oligodendrocyte differentiation of mouse embryo-derived neural
stem cells in vitro. Interventional treatment of this early phenotype
with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) LBH589 led to signifi-
cant improvement in behavioral changes and markers of dopaminer-
gic neurotransmission and complete reversal of aberrant neuronal
differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Our data support the notion that
neurodevelopmental changes contribute to the prodromal phase of
HD and that early, presymptomatic intervention using HDACi may
represent a promising novel treatment approach for HD.

athological CAG repeat expansions in the human Huntingtin
(HTT) gene on chromosome 4p16.3 cause autosomal domi-
nant Huntington disease (HD), which is clinically characterized
by the triad of chorea, cognitive dysfunction, and psychiatric
symptoms (1, 2). After clinical onset the disease inevitably pro-
gresses, leading to severe disability and premature death with no
effective disease-modifying treatments available.
The CNS pathology in advanced stages of HD is characterized by a
loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (3) and cortical structures (4) as
well as the presence of HTT+ and ubiquitin+ cytoplasmic and nuclear
protein aggregates in neurons (5–7). The lengths of pathological
CAG repeat expansions, which extend the polyglutamine stretch
within HTT, correlate with earlier disease onset and greater severity
(1, 8, 9). Over the past decades, the field has shifted from considering
HD solely as a late-onset neurodegenerative disease: Instead HD is
more recognized as a developmental disorder with various effects of
mutant HTT (mHTT) on early neurodevelopment (10, 11).
HTT is expressed in preimplantation stages of the embryo (12,
13), and loss of HTT expression in mice is embryonic lethal (14–
16), underlining its developmental importance. Several studies
document mHTT-dependent changes during development, both
Significance
In Huntington disease (HD) gene carriers the disease-causing
mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) is already present during early de-
velopmental stages, but, surprisingly, HD patients develop
clinical symptoms only many years later. While a develop-
mental role of Huntingtin has been described, so far new
therapeutic approaches targeting those early neurodevelop-
mental processes are lacking. Here, we show that behavioral,
cellular, and molecular changes associated with mHTT in the
postnatal period of genetic animal models of HD can be
reverted using low-dose treatment with a histone deacetyla-
tion inhibitor. Our findings support a neurodevelopmental
basis for HD and provide proof of concept that pre-HD symp-
toms, including aberrant neuronal differentiation, are re-
versible by early therapeutic intervention in vivo.

 in vivo and in stem cell-derived culture paradigms (11, 17–21).
Specifically, mHTT affects striatal development in the Hdh-
Q111 embryo (22), and conditional mHTT expression during de-
velopment is sufficient to generate HD-like symptoms (23, 24). In
animal models, early behavioral, cellular, and metabolic abnor-
malities are discernible in 4-wk-old tgHD rats and R6/2 mice, and
changes in myelination were found in 14-d-old Hdh-Q250 mice
(25–28). These studies indicate that HD pathology includes a
neurodevelopmental phase that is present long before the onset of
HD-like neurodegeneration and which not only contributes to the
classical disease symptoms but is also likely to shape prodromal
stages of HD.
In contrast to the later stages of symptomatic HD, prodromal
manifestations are much less clearly defined. Previous studies
indicate that emotional dysfunction and minor motor signs may
precede the characteristic symptomatology (29, 30). Longitudi-
nal studies of HD carriers aim to define the spectrum of early
psychiatric symptoms in HD (29, 31). Additionally, differences in
cranial volume and growth have been observed in young, pre-
symptomatic gene carriers (32). Thus, the clinical and molecular
delineation of the early stages of HD is a central issue in the
implementation of future targeted treatment strategies and the
identification of new biomarkers.
Here, we provide evidence that changes in neuronal differ-
entiation continue postnatally in two mouse and rat HD animal
models and that molecular, cellular, and behavioral alterations
may be reversible through early therapeutic intervention with
histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). HDACi are promising
compounds that are neuroprotective in HD mice (33), alleviate
motor symptoms in the R6/2 model (34, 35), and were in clinical
trials for HD (36).
A previous study showed that mHTT affects neural development
pathways in HD-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
(21), and we extend these findings to the systems level, revealing
cellular and behavioral correlates of neurodevelopmental gene-
expression pathways. Importantly, these mHTT-induced changes
are reversible by low-dose therapy with the histone deacetylase
inhibitor LBH589 (Panobinostat), which restores neural differen-
tiation phenotypes in vitro and in vivo.
Results
Transgenic Rodent HD Models Display a Postnatal Behavioral Phenotype
with Decreased Anxiety. We began by investigating if the presence of
mHTT in the developing CNS causes measurable changes in early
postnatal HD animals. Therefore, we employed the earliest quan-
tifiable behavioral assays and tested transgenic tgHD (51 CAG
repeats, adult onset) and BACHD mouse (97 CAG repeats, juve-
nile onset) pups for emotional behavior (ultrasonic vocalization,
USV) at postnatal day (P) 10, sensorimotor gating (prepulse in-
hibition, PPI) at P17, and risk-taking behavior [novel cage test, NCT
(37)] at P21. USV analysis revealed a decreased number and
shorter duration of ultrasonic calls from both tgHD rat and
BACHD transgenic pups separated from their dam compared with
WT littermates (Fig. 1 A and B), indicating changes in perception
(reduced awareness), emotionality (reduced anxiety), and/or exec-
utive functions (reduced pattern to vocalize as an indicator of
emotional and/or motor functions). We employed PPI to test for a
reduction in sensorimotor gating and observed a loss of PPI in
tgHD rats but not in BACHD mice (Fig. 1 C and D). In a test for
anxiety and risk-taking behavior, transgenic pups from both models
showed greater mobility and remained in the center area of a new
cage for significantly longer durations than WT pups, suggesting
reduced anxiety and increased risk-taking behavior (Fig. 1 E and F).
These combined tests indicate decreased anxiety levels in early
postnatal HD rodents. Fig. 1 G and H summarize the behavioral
phenotypes of the tgHD rat model and the BACHD mouse
model, respectively.
Dopaminergic and Glutamatergic Imbalance in Postnatal tgHD Rat
Striatum. We then analyzed gene expression in the striatum of
homozygous tgHD P10 rat pups and age-matched WT littermates
using Affymetrix arrays to identify molecular changes that may be
the underlying cause for the early behavioral symptoms. This

Early behavioral phenotyping in transgenic models of Huntington dis-
ease. Rat (SPRDtgHD) and mouse (BACHD) pups were screened for a behavioral
phenotype between P10 and P21. (A and B) The number and total duration of
ultrasonic calls in WT, hemizygous (HET), and homozygous (HOM) rat pups (n >
30) (A) and WT and hemizygous (BACHD) mouse pups (n > 7) (B) were de-
termined at P10. Transgenic pups emitted significantly fewer calls of shorter
duration. (C and D) Startle response and PPI were measured at P17. Transgenic
HD rat pups showed a significant loss of PPI at a prepulse of 80 dB white noise
(n > 8) (C), while no differences were observed in BACHD mice at this age (n = 10)
(D). (E and F) Altered exploration and risk behavior were detected in transgenic
preweaning rats (E) as well as in transgenic mice at P21 (F) using the NCT. The
time spent in the center of the cage was significantly increased in tgHD homo-
zygous rat pups (n = 5) (E) and BACHD mouse pups (n = 8) (F), while the time
spent in the wall area was significantly decreased. (G and H) A time-course graph
illustrates the development of the behavioral phenotype of the transgenic tgHD
rats (G) and BACHD mice (H). Data represent means ± SEM. Statistical analyses

 revealed a high number of differentially regulated genes (Fig. 2A and
Dataset S1). Using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software to
classify genes according to function, we identified 17 aberrantly
regulated candidate genes associated with “behavior” (Fig. 2 B and
C). qRT-PCR validation confirmed aberrant regulation of seven
candidates: angiotensinogen (Agt), ATPase, Ca2+ transport (Atp2A2),
Forkhead box G1B (FoxG1B), hypocretin (orexin) receptor (Hcrtr2),
potassium channel, member 1 (Kcnc1), solute carrier family 6, 3
(dopamine transporter) (Slc6A3), and tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) (Fig.
2B). Since the two most up-regulated of these seven candidates were
related to dopaminergic signaling (Fig. 2C), we analyzed striatal
dopaminergic circuits in more detail and further quantified the
mRNA levels of DARPP-32, the dopamine receptor D1A, and pro-
tein kinase A (PKA) by qRT-PCR. In contrast to the observed up-
regulation of Slc6A3 and Th, we found that all three genes were sig-
nificantly down-regulated in the striatum of tgHD P10 pups (Fig. 2D).
Western blot analyses of total protein extracts from striatal
tissue at P10 confirmed significantly reduced protein levels of
DARPP-32 (Fig. 2E). Of note, there was a trend toward in-
creased phosphorylation at Thr75 and Thr34 in DARPP-32.
These studies were complemented by autoradiography for
striatal expression of D1A, D2, NMDA, 5-HT2, adenosine A1,

Molecular analyses of tgHD P10 striata. (A) Microarray analysis of rat striata at P10 (WT vs. HOM, n = 5 each) demonstrated clusters of up- (yellow) and
down- (blue) regulated gene expression. (B) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed 17 target mRNAs associated with behavior, 7 of which (#) were validated by
qRT-PCR (P values are from ANOVA vs. WT; n > 8). (C) Network analysis indicated deregulation of dopaminergic signaling; relevant pathways are highlighted
in yellow). Rat P10 striatal mRNA expression of DARPP-32, PKA, and dopamine receptor D1A is down-regulated, whereas the expression of the dopamine

different in WT and transgenic pups. (F) Receptor autoradiography revealed a significant reduction of dopamine receptor D1A density and NMDAR density in
the striata of transgenic rat pups (two-tailed t test; n = 5). Representative autoradiographs of coronal sections of P10 rats are presented. (G) Immunohis-
tochemistry confirmed the reduced expression of DARPP32 and TH in the striatum of P10 tgHD pups (shown are representative images from n = 10 pups).

 and adenosine A2A receptors in P10 rat pups. We found de-
creased levels of the dopaminergic receptor D1A (Fig. 2F) and
NMDA receptor (NMDAR) density (Fig. 2F and SI Appendix,
Fig. S1A). Further Western blot analyses of NMDAR subunits
revealed down-regulation of NR1, NR2B, and NR2C (SI Appen-
dix, Fig. S1B). Immunohistochemical analysis of P10 tgHD striata
confirmed reduced expression of DARPP32 and TH (Fig. 1G).
As mRNA expression changes do not always translate into
altered protein levels, and because other regulatory mechanisms
may also affect protein synthesis, we performed proteomic
analysis using 2D electrophoresis and subsequent MALDI-TOF
of P10 pup striata as well. In the R6/2 model, large-scale alter-
ations of protein levels precede the onset of classical symptoms
(38). Similarly, we found 156 proteins to be significantly altered
in pre-HD tgHD rat brains. These could be classified into six
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways,
confirming the observed alterations in metabolic pathways (38)
and further identifying changes in axon sprouting and neurode-
generative pathways (Dataset S2). These studies revealed an
additional down-regulated regulatory subunit of protein phos-
phatase 1 (PPP1R7) (39, 40). Taken together, these data reveal
imbalances in dopaminergic and glutamatergic pathways in the
early postnatal period of tgHD rats sufficient to explain the
behavioral phenotype.
Altered Neuronal and Oligodendroglial Differentiation Capacity in
HD. Olfactory dysfunction is among the earliest discernible
symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson,
Alzheimer, and Huntington disease (41). Because of the well-
established link between subventricular zone (SVZ) neuro-
genesis and the olfactory system, the observed association of
aberrant SVZ neurogenesis and olfactory dysfunction in neuro-
degenerative diseases (42), the reported regulatory functions of
dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling for neurogenesis (43),
and the potential implications of the olfactory system for our
observations of animal behavior, we investigated SVZ neuro-
genesis in our model.
While neurodegeneration is characteristic of HD, previous
studies observed aberrant neuronal differentiation during em-
bryonic development in vitro and in vivo in the Hdh-Q111 model
(22, 23), as well as in iPSC-derived neural precursors from HD
patients (21). Therefore it is likely that any aberrations on the
cellular and molecular level underlying behavioral changes
are the product of aberrant neurodevelopmental rather than
neurodegenerative processes. Consequently, we asked whether
mHTT affected neuronal differentiation capacities of SVZ
neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) during postnatal develop-
ment. We cultured NSCs from P10 WT, tgHD+/−, and tgHD+/+
pups and differentiated them into glial and neuronal lineages.
This resulted in a significant, gene dose-dependent reduction in
neuronal numbers at all time points (Fig. 3 A–C). Analysis of
differentiation to mature neuronal phenotypes revealed a re-
duction in bIII tubulin+ neurons at 7 d in vitro (DIV) (Fig. 3B),
as well as lower numbers of NeuN+ neurons at 14 and 28 DIV
(Fig. 3B). Likewise, Darpp32+ cell numbers were reduced in
tgHD+/+ cultures at 14 and 28 DIV, while we observed an in-
crease at 14 DIV and a decrease at 28 DIV in tgHD+/− cultures
(Fig. 3C). Astrocyte numbers were unchanged, but oligoden-
drocyte counts were significantly increased after differentiation
(Fig. 3 A and B). These findings demonstrate an increase in
oligodendroglial differentiation at the expense of neuron pro-
duction from SVZ-derived NSC cultures in heterozygous and
homozygous tgHD pups. Differentiation of tgHD cultures was
accompanied by an increase in apoptotic cells identified by active
caspase 3 staining. This is also reflected in reduced total cell
counts in tgHD+/− and tgHD+/+ cultures compared with WT
cultures (Fig. 3D).
To determine if neuronal, oligodendroglial, and glial differ-
entiation capacity was also affected in BACHD mice, we gen-
erated neurospheres from BACHD and WT littermates at E13.5.
We detected significant reductions in the total number of cells,
MAP2-immunopositive neurons, and 2′3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-
phosphodiesterase (CNPase)-immunopositive oligodendrocytes
in BACHD cultures compared with WT cultures at 7 DIV, while
astrocyte numbers remained unchanged (Fig. 3E).
Because of the profound changes in differentiation capacity
between WT and tgHD NSC cultures, we were interested in
whether in vivo neurogenesis was affected by the presence of
mHTT. To address this, we crossbred tgHD rats with a model
expressing the reporter dsRed2 under control of the Dcx pro-
moter (dcx::dsRed2,tgHD) (44). Dcx is a marker of newborn,
migratory neurons and is expressed up to 14 d after the birth of
new neurons (45). We analyzed sagittal sections of dsRed2+ WT
and tgHD pups, revealing minor differences in rostral migratory
stream (RMS) and olfactory bulb (OB) volumes and a significant
reduction in the content of Dcx+ neurons (proportional to the
relative fluorescence intensity; see heatmaps in Fig. 3F). This
corroborates the reduced capacity for SVZ neurogenesis in the
tgHD model.
Of note, diffusion tensor imaging (46) revealed a trend toward
an increase in axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean dif-
fusivity and a reduction in fractional anisotropy in tgHD pups
compared with WT pups (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C).
Low-Dose LBH589 Treatment Restores the Early Behavioral, Cellular,
and Molecular Phenotype in HD. The observed mHTT-associated
aberrations at the molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels in
these HD models extend previously reported alterations in em-
bryonic development to the early postnatal phase, a time of
neuronal maturation and gliogenesis. We next tested whether
therapeutic intervention can restore these changes.
HDACi have a long history of use for their mood-stabilizing
and antiepileptic effects. In models of HD, previous studies have
demonstrated that the HDACi SAHA (Vorinostat) could re-
verse motor symptoms and improve phenotypes in the R6/
2 model (34, 35). Because of the neuroprotective effects of
LBH589 in mouse models of HD (33) and its ability to cross the
blood–brain barrier (Dataset S3) (47), we treated tgHD pups
with this HDACi. TgHD rat pups and WT littermates were
subjected to four different dose regiments, administered every
other day between P8 and P20 (Fig. 4A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2
A and B). We analyzed USV at P11, startle response and PPI at
P17, and the NCT at P21. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg
LBH589 led to significantly increased USV in transgenic rat
pups (Fig. 4B). LBH589 had a suppressive effect on PPI and
startle response independent of the individual genotype at all
doses (Fig. 4C). In addition, performance in the NCT was im-
proved in tgHD rats: Duration in the center was reduced, and
duration in the wall areas increased to match values of vehicle-
treated WT animals (Fig. 4D). In contrast, LBH589 had no effect
on WT animals in this test. Furthermore, the average velocity
and track length in tgHD pups were restored to WT levels (SI
Appendix, Fig. S2A), while in the 0.01 mg/kg WT group the av-
erage velocity and track length were significantly decreased
compared with vehicle-treated WT animals. The improved per-
formance of LBH589-treated tgHD pups in USV and NCT tests
indicates that this compound alleviates the reduced anxiety and
increases risk-taking behavior in these animals.
We have previously demonstrated that HDACi increase the
neuronal differentiation capacities of NSCs (48). Therefore, we
tested whether exposure to LBH589 could restore neuronal
differentiation of tgHD NSCs in vitro. After testing for optimal
dose regimens (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C), we found that treatment
of differentiating NSC cultures with 10 nM LBH589 for 24 h
restored neuronal differentiation of tgHD cultures to WT levels.

 Comparing bIII tubulin+ cells at 7 DIV and NeuN+ and
Darpp32+ cells at 14 DIV, we observed a significant increase
in neurons at all time points (Fig. 4E), indicating improved
regenerative capacities of SVZ stem/progenitor cells after treat-
ment. LBH589 treatment had no effect on total cell numbers in WT
controls but increased tgHD total cell numbers (Fig. 4F).
Similarly, treatment of E13.5-derived BACHD NSC cultures
with 10 nM LBH589 increased the percentage of MAP2+ neu-
rons in both WT and BACHD cultures at 7 DIV (Fig. 4G).
LBH589 exerted a positive effect in WT cultures at 1 nM, whereas
BACHD cultures required 10 nM to increase the percentage of
MAP2 cells. Furthermore, treatment increased the percentage of
CNPase+ oligodendrocytes at 7 DIV. There were no differences in
GFAP+ astrocyte numbers between any treatment conditions in
BACHD and WT cultures (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 D–G).
Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling (Fig. 2, SI Appendix,

(A, Left) Cellular analysis of tgHD P10 neurogenesis. Quantitative analysis of P10 rat neurosphere differentiation demonstrated reduced neuronal (bIII
tubulin, green, Upper) and increased oligodendroglial (CNP, green, Lower) differentiation, while astroglial (GFAP, red, Upper ) fates were unaffected (Scale bar,
20 μm applies to all images.). (Right) Graphical representation indicates percentages ± SEM of individual cell types. (B) After 7 d in vitro (DIV) differentiation,
neuron numbers were significantly decreased, while oligodendrocyte counts were increased. Astrocyte numbers were not affected significantly. Numbers of
mature, NeuN-expressing neurons were significantly reduced at 14 DIV and 28 DIV. (C) Similarly, DARPP32+ cell counts were significantly reduced at both time
points. (D) The differentiation phenotype was accompanied by an increase in apoptosis, which is reflected in lower cell counts after differentiation. In A–D:
ANOVA; n = 3 independent experiments with 10 replicates. (E) Differentiation of BACHD embryonic (E13.5) neurospheres revealed significantly lower numbers of
total cells and MAP2+ and CNPase+ cells compared with WT cultures (ANOVA; n = 8). GFAP+ astrocyte counts were unchanged. (F) In vivo changes in neuronal
differentiation are reflected in the RMS and OB of P10 Dcx-dsRed2-tgHD double transgenic pups (Mann–Whitney U test, n = 7). (Upper Left) Inverted fluorescence

(A) Treatment of early phenotype using HDAC inhibitor LBH589. tgHD HOM pups and WT controls were treated with the HDACi LBH589 from P8 to
P20 (n = 10 each). Behavioral readouts were USV (P11), startle response and PPI (P17), and NCT (P21). Four different doses (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg body
weight) were administered i.p. every other day. (B) The numbers of ultrasonic calls were significantly increased in transgenic animals treated with
LBH589 compared with vehicle controls. The increase in the total duration in transgenic animals did not reach significance except for the 0.1 mg/kg group
(0.001 mg/kg: P = 0.2561; 0.01 mg/kg: P = 0.1949; 0.1 mg/kg: P = 0.0016; ANOVA; n > 10). (C) PPI was suppressed in animals treated with LBH589 in all doses
tested compared with WT (ANOVA; n > 3). (D) LBH589 treatment significantly decreased the time spent in center areas and increased the time spent in wall
areas in transgenic rats compared with corresponding vehicle-treated transgenic animals (ANOVA; n > 4). LBH589 had no significant effect on WT animals.
(E) LBH589 treatment of differentiating neurosphere cultures restored tgHD HOM neuron numbers to WT levels. Shown are representative images of cultures
treated with 10 nM LBH589 for 24 h. (Scale bar, 20 μm in both images.) TuJ+ neurons were counted after 7 d, and NeuN+ and Darpp32+ neurons were
quantified after 14 d. TuJ+, NeuN+, and Darpp32+ cells were within the range of WT cultures (ANOVA; n = 3 independent experiments with 10 replicates).
(F) LBH589 treatment resulted in increased cell counts in transgenic but not in WT cell cultures. (G, Right) The percentage of MAP2-immunopositive neurons was
significantly increased with 10 nM LBH589 in WT and BACHD E13.5 neurosphere cultures (ANOVA; n = 8). (Left) A representative photomicrograph showing
MAP2+ neurons (green) and DAPI (blue) from WT and BACHD cultures. (Scale bar, 100 μm.) (H) LBH589 treatment (0.001 mg/kg) increased striatal RasGRP2

 Appendix, Fig. S4). We therefore tested whether in vivo
LBH589 treatment affected expression of a target gene of the
dopamine pathway in medium spiny neurons (RasGRP2), which
is down-regulated in HD (49). LBH589 treatment increased
RasGRP2 expression and restored protein levels of two addi-
tional markers of striatal development, DARPP-32 and PPP1R7
(Fig. 4H and SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
To determine whether LBH589 was capable of restoring neu-
rogenesis in vivo, we quantified RMS volume and Dcx staining
intensity in vehicle- and LBH589-treated WT and tgHD pups at
P21. Continuous administration of 0.001 mg/kg LBH589 from
P8 to P20 (seven doses) could restore in vivo neuronal differen-
tiation and neurogenesis in tgHD pups to WT levels (Fig. 4I).
Thus, early postnatal behavioral, cellular, and molecular alter-
ations of HD can be alleviated by low-dose therapy with LBH589.
Discussion
Here we describe behavioral, cellular, and molecular changes
during a developmental phase of gliogenesis and neuronal mat-
uration that is comparable to the third trimester of human ges-
tation (50). Importantly, these changes can be reversed by
treatment with HDACi, which fully restores alterations in neu-
ronal differentiation in HD pups. Hence, these data contribute
to the increasing evidence of neurodevelopmental aberrations in
genetic animal models of HD and suggest that HD should be
considered a neurodevelopmental disorder.
We identify reduced separation-induced USV at P10 and in-
creased risk-taking behavior at P21 as key features of an early
behavioral phenotype in transgenic HD mice and rats. These
features may correspond to an anxiolytic phenotype similar to
the reduced anxiety-like behavior found in transgenic HD rats at
1 mo of age (26) or may be attributable to depression-like fea-
tures as described in 2-mo-old BACHD mice (51). Dopaminergic
and glutamatergic signaling regulate neuronal differentiation
during development, and deregulation of these pathways may
provide a molecular basis for HD-associated behavioral changes.
These species-independent behavioral abnormalities provide a
readout for the prodromal phase of HD, which is characterized
by neurodevelopmental rather than neurodegenerative mecha-
nisms. mHTT causes aberrant neuronal differentiation during
embryonic development and from iPSCs (21–24). Our findings
link alterations in neuronal differentiation and molecular path-
ways to behavior on the systems level.
These observations support the notion that HD pathology
consists of at least three phases: (i) an early phase with successful
adaptation to the effects of accumulating mutant Htt, likely to be
outbalanced by changes in early neurodevelopment. This early
phenotype presents with signs of overcompensation and is fol-
lowed by an intermediate and largely silent phase, which,
depending on the number of CAG repeats at mid-age, shifts into
a third phase of overt decompensation and neurodegeneration.
The notion that this early phase of HD may be viewed as a slowly
progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that ultimately trans-
forms into a neurodegenerative disease is documented in many
studies identifying symptoms long before the onset of neuro-
degeneration in animal models (25–28, 52). In view of this evi-
dence for a “pre-HD syndrome,” it should be mentioned that
such changes may not be “disease-like” but instead may reflect a
whole spectrum of signs and symptoms attributable to higher
glutamine availability in the CNS and/or successful compensa-
tion and repair of the very early damage associated with mHTT.
The former would be in line with the hypothesis of polyglutamine
diseases arising from evolutionary search mechanisms (53)
attempting to increase central glutamine storage in the brain,
while the latter would imply that neurotrophic factors are in-
duced, which may affect development in all its dimensions of
growth, maturation, and learning. Whether mHTT causes de-
velopmental aberrations in gene carriers is still unclear, but re-
cent studies have found differences in growth and development
as well as in cranial volume in both adult (32) and juvenile (54)
premanifest gene carriers.
Microarray analyses detected deregulation of the dopamine-
signaling pathway in postnatal tgHD rats. This was corroborated
by findings of deficits in the D1/cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32 signaling
cascade of P10 tgHD rats. These findings in the postnatal tgHD
rat brain mirror previous imaging studies in asymptomatic HD
gene carriers (55, 56), which revealed a reduction of striatal
D1 and D2 receptors. Evidence of dopaminergic deregulation and
receptor imbalance has been further substantiated in molecular
studies of postmortem HD brains (57–59) and imaging studies of
symptomatic HD patients (60, 61). Previous studies in 4-wk-old
HD mice also demonstrated a reduction of total levels of DARPP-
32 and D1 receptor protein levels (62). We previously showed that
a significant loss of striatal D1 receptor expression and DARPP-
32+ cells is present in 14-mo-old male tgHD animals. Beyond
deregulation of dopaminergic-signaling pathways, we observed
significantly reduced NMDAR density in the striatum of tgHD
P10 rat pups. NMDAR numbers are reduced, particularly in the
basal ganglia, in both symptomatic (63, 64) and presymptomatic
(65) HD patients. Early changes in extrasynaptic NMDAR sig-
naling and expression have also been reported in 1-mo-old pre-
symptomatic YAC72 and YAC128 mice before the onset of motor
dysfunction and neuronal loss (66). Furthermore, there is evidence
indicating that mHTT increases NR2B-containing extrasynaptic
NMDARs in the striatum of young YAC72 and YAC128 mice
(67). By contrast, our own data in P10 rat tissue show a down-
regulation of the NR1, NR2B, and NR2C subunits of NMDARs.
A pathogenic link between dopamine and glutamate signaling is
provided by studies showing that striatal dopamine modulates
ionotropic glutamate receptors by altering glutamate currents and
by modifying glutamate receptor surface localization (68, 69).
Since D1 receptors and NMDARs are capable of direct in-
teraction, which affects receptor activity (70), it is possible that the
aberrant striatal receptor expression observed in P10 tgHD rats is
due to abnormal glutamate/dopamine receptor interactions. Al-
ternatively, down-regulation of D1A receptors and NMDARs
could also suggest a developmental delay in tgHD pups.
SVZ neurogenesis has been shown to affect social behavior
(71), and aberrations in olfaction and SVZ neurogenesis are
among the earliest symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases (41,
42). SVZ neurogenesis is modulated by dopamine and glutamate
(43); thus it is likely that the observed deregulation of both
pathways extends to neural stem cells as well. We demonstrate
that SVZ-derived NSC cultures show a prominent reduction of
their neuronal differentiation in both tgHD and BACHD models,
which is corroborated by a reduction of NeuN+ neurons at 14 and
28 DIV in tgHD. The different results in oligodendrocyte differ-
entiation between tgHD and BACHD models may be explained
by their different ages at isolation. Oligodendroglial maturation
and myelination start around P14 in vivo; thus embryonic-derived
BACHD cultures may be too early to reflect mHtt effects on the
oligodendrocyte lineage. Altered SVZ neurogenesis could be
confirmed in vivo in P10 tgHD rats. Others have shown the rel-
evance of mHTT during development (22, 23) as well as its impact
on the differentiation capacities of pluripotent SC-derived neural
precursors (21, 72). mHTT has been shown to affect the pro-
liferation and cell fate of cortical progenitor cells (18). Conse-
quently, the reduced neuronal differentiation observed here is
likely due to direct effects of mHTT in neural precursors.
Bystander microenvironmental effects, e.g., from microglia,
may contribute as well, as it has been shown that these cells affect
SVZ neurogenesis in vitro (73). The specific effects of mHTT on
postnatal neurogenesis in symptomatic HD models are somewhat
controversial. While some studies did not find changes in SVZ
proliferation or differentiation in R6/2 or YAC128 mice (74, 75),
others detected reduced levels of neurogenesis in the R6/2 model

 (76, 77) and aberrant neuronal differentiation in tgHD rats (78).
In HD patients, cell proliferation in the SVZ is increased, which
correlates with disease grade (79). Importantly, our observations
are made long before the onset of classical symptoms. Thus, it is
conceivable that mHTT reduces the generation of new neurons
during earlier stages, while SVZ cell proliferation as a reaction to
neurodegenerative processes dominates later stages of the disease.
Reduced neurogenesis may ultimately contribute to disease
progression, i.e., lack of regeneration of striatal cell loss and
dysfunction. This hypothesis is further supported by the obser-
vation of reduced numbers of striatal neurons (80) and reduced
numbers of medium spiny neurons (81) in the tgHD rat model.
Transcriptional deregulation is known to be part of the patho-
genesis of HD (82, 83). A number of studies showed that HDACi
ameliorate neurodegeneration in cell systems and fly models (84)
as well as motor deficits in a mouse model of HD (34, 85). Here
we treated postnatal tgHD rats with the HDACi LBH589 (86) to
intervene with neurodevelopmental changes in a preclinical set-
ting. LBH589 is known to cross the blood–brain barrier efficiently
and has already been tested in preclinical studies (33, 47). Low-
dose treatment with LBH589 led to a partial reversal of behavioral
symptoms and restored aberrant neuronal differentiation in tgHD
and BACHD cultures in vitro and in tgHD pups in vivo. We
conclude that very early LBH589 treatment may be a promising
treatment approach in HD.
Methods
Animals. We used several tgHD litters derived from mating male and female
tgHD+/− rats carrying a truncated human HTT fragment of 51 CAG repeats
under control of the native rat HTT promoter (87). BACHD mouse pups were
derived from mating hemizygous male BACHD mice (expressing floxed HTT
with 97 CAG repeats) with female FVB/N dams (88). All animal experiments
presented here were approved by local ethical boards of the District Gov-
ernment of Middle Franconia, Bavaria, Germany (approval no. 54-2532.1-16/08)
and the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee,
and were conducted according to local, NIH, and ARRIVE guidelines (89).
Behavioral Phenotyping.
USV. P10 rat and mouse pups were placed into a recording cage in a sound-
isolation box. The detection sessions were initiated directly thereafter and
were always performed by the same experienced experimenter between
8 and 10 AM. A maximum of two pups per litter were tested for 5 min each.
For P10 rats and mice signals were recorded at a 35–250 kHz range using an
Avisoft Ultra Sound Gate 116Hb (Avisoft Bioacoustics). Incoming signals
were displayed as a time–event plot by Avisoft recorder software. For fur-
ther statistical analysis, the parameters number of events (n) and total du-
ration of cues (s) were analyzed using one-way ANOVA.
Acoustic startle response and PPI. Startle response and PPI were measured in
homozygous (+/+; n ≥ 10), hemizygous (+/−; n ≥ 10), and WT (−/−; n ≥ 10) tgHD
rats and hemizygous (+/−; n ≥ 10) and WT (−/−; n ≥ 10) BACHD mice at P17.
The test point was validated in preliminary experiments. Pups were placed in
a startle chamber, and the protocol was conducted as described previously
(90). Results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and are displayed as the
percentage of startle-response inhibition.
NCT. The NCT was performed in P21 preweaning homozygous (+/+; n ≥ 5),
hemizygous (+/−; n ≥ 5), and WT pups analyzed using one-way ANOVA.
Treatment with HDACi LBH589. Pups were genotyped 3 d after birth, divided
into groups of 10 according to genotype, and marked daily throughout the
experiment. The animals were treated with LBH589 (Novartis) using the
following doses: 0.001 mg salt/kg body weight, 0.01 mg salt/kg body weight,
0.1 mg salt/kg body weight, and 1 mg salt/kg body weight. Control animals
were treated with vehicle: 0.03 M lactic acid/5% dextrose in water buffered to
pH 4.2–4.5 with 0.1 M NaOH. LBH589 was administered i.p. every 48 h from
P8 to P20. The behavioral tests were performed at P11 (USV), P17 (startle
response and PPI), and P21 (NCT). Pups were killed at day 21 for histology.
Double-Transgenic Model and in Vivo Neurogenesis. tgHD rats were crossbred
with a rat model expressing dsRed2 under control of the dcx promoter (Dcx::
dsRed2) (91). The resulting offspring were interbred to generate hemizygous
tgHD rats that were either homozygous or WT for dcx-dsRed2 (tgHD+/−
dsRed2−/− or tgHD+/− dsRed2+/+). Interbreeding these animals generated
tgHD WT and homozygous offspring that were heterozygous for dcx-dsRed2
(tgHD−/− dsRed+/− or tgHD+/+ dsRed2+/−). Animals from these litters were
genotyped at P3 and were used for experiments at P10. Pups were anes-
thetized on ice and then were transcardially perfused using 4% para-
formaldehyde (PFA), and their brains were removed and postfixed in 4%
PFA overnight. Fixed brains were washed twice in PBS and then were sec-
tioned at 100 microns in the sagittal plane on a Leica VT-1000S vibratome.
Serial sections from one hemisphere were mounted onto glass slides, air-
dried, and coverslipped using VECTASHIELD with DAPI (Vector Laboratories).
Low-power fluorescent images were taken on a Leica DMLB epifluorescence
microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Spot Imaging Solutions). To obtain
full images of brain sections, multiple gray-scale images were acquired per
section using Spot Advanced software (Spot Imaging Solutions) and were
merged into a full image and inverted into black-on-white images using
Photoshop CS4 (Adobe Systems). Merged images were imported into ImageJ
(NIH), and area size and mean pixel values of RMS and OB were analyzed.
Data Analysis. All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prizm 7.0 (GraphPad
Software), and statistical significance was determined using appropriate
statistical tests, as indicated in the figure legends. A P value of < 0.05 was
deemed significant for all analyses. We used the D’Agostino–Pearson
method to test for normal distribution of data points.
Additional methods are listed in SI Appendix.
