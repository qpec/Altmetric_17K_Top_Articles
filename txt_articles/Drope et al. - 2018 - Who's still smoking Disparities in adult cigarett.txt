Abstract: The continuing high prevalence of cigarette smoking among specific sub-
populations, many of them vulnerable, is one of the most pressing challenges facing
the tobacco control community. These populations include individuals in lower edu-
cation and/or socioeconomic groups; from certain racial/ethnic groups; in the les-
bian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community; with mental illness; and in the
military, particularly among those in the lowest pay grades. Although traditional
tobacco control measures are having positive health effects for most groups, the
effects are not sufficient for others. More attention to and support for promising
novel interventions, in addition to new attempts at reaching these populations
through conventional interventions that have proven to be effective, are crucial going
forward to find new ways to address these disparities. CA Cancer J Clin

Introduction
Despite the overall substantial decrease in the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the
United States in the last 50 years, there remain persistent intergroup disparities in
cigarette smoking prevalence and secondhand smoke exposure. This article focuses
on cigarette smoking as opposed to pipes, cigars, hookah, or other products. This is
not to deny the importance of these other types of smoking; rather, we are focusing
on tobacco cigarettes both to enhance the consistency of the comparisons that we
are making and because of the overwhelming harms that stem from this particular
product. Accordingly, the rest of this article will refer to “cigarette smoking” as sim-
ply “smoking.” Figure 1 (methodology discussed below) demonstrates the decrease
in adult smoking prevalence from 42% in 1965 to 15% in 2015. Despite this pro-
gress, the absolute number of smokers has declined more slowly because of overall
population growth, and there remain approximately 40 million smokers in the
United States. This high absolute number of smokers begs an important question:
who is still smoking? Tobacco use and associated disease burden is increasingly con-
centrated among vulnerable and frequently overlapping populations. When we
incorporate disparities around access to care in this already problematic dynamic, the
interaction is devastating from the standpoint of both health and equity.
Smokers tend to be disadvantaged socially and economically, and these demo-
graphic segments consequently tend to bear the majority of morbidity and prema-
ture mortality associated with smoking.1 To illustrate, Jha et al2 found that, among
middle-aged males (ages 35-69 years) with a high-school education or less (12
years or less) in the United States, smoking-related deaths accounted for 40.5% of
total deaths in 1996. By contrast, smoking-related deaths for those with more than
a high-school education accounted for 22% of deaths in the same age group.
Extrapolating further from these data, those authors calculated that the probability
of a premature death from smoking was 15% for men with a high-school education
or less versus 4% for those with more than a high school education. Although the
data Jha et al used are now more than a decade old, we demonstrate in this review

 that many of the behavioral inequities that contribute to the
health inequities that Jha et al observed remain.
This research examines some of the major disparities in
smoking prevalence in the United States that persist by edu-
cation, income, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, mental ill-
ness diagnosis, geography, and active military status. Our
primary goal is descriptive: to determine who is still smok-
ing. However, we will point to other reviews and articles
that have attempted the difficult task of disentangling the
precise causal mechanisms of these differences. Causal attri-
bution is difficult in part because individuals often belong to
multiple groups (eg, an individual might suffer from mental
illness and be in a lower socioeconomic group). We begin
by demonstrating trends in smoking prevalence in these
key groups. We also briefly discuss similar dynamics in sec-
ondhand smoke exposure. We then discuss some of the vari-
ables
that
appear to be
significant drivers
of
these
differences, and finally highlight some new initiatives to
address these disparities.
Methods
We used the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to
create Figures 1 through 4 and data from the National Sur-
vey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to create Figure 5.
Both the NHIS and the NSDUH are nationally representa-
tive surveys of the noninstitutionalized civilian American
population, and each is conducted in person with more than
70,000 individuals annually. The NHIS covers the popula-
tion of persons aged 18 years and older, whereas the
NSDUH covers the population aged 12 years and older.
We calculated past-month cigarette smoking prevalence in
each survey to include those who had smoked at least
100 cigarettes in their lifetime and had smoked a cigarette
on at least 1 day in the 30 days before the survey. Prevalence
point estimates were adjusted by final person weights in
each survey. Current cigarette smoking prevalence among
Americans aged 18 years and older in the NHIS was multi-
plied by the population size of that group in each year to
obtain the number of smokers displayed in Figure 1. NHIS
respondents were divided by consistent categories of their
highest educational attainment back to 1965 to create Fig-
ure 2. Figures 3 and 4 combined publicly available estimates
of current smoking by poverty status and racial/ethnic
groups with newer data from the 2015 to 2016 NHIS
divided along the same categories by sex. To create Figure
5, NSDUH respondents between 2009 and 2014 were
divided according to whether they reported suffering from a
serious mental illness in the past year. For Figure 7 (sexual
orientation),3 we used reported survey results from the 2012
and 2013 National Adult Tobacco Survey, which is a strati-
fied, national random-digit–dialed, mobile and landline
telephone survey of approximately 60,000 noninstitutional-
ized US adults aged 18 years or older. To examine geo-
graphic disparity, we use the Behavioral Risk Factors
Surveillance System because of its very wide geographic cov-
erage in all 50 states (Figs. 10 and 11). Because we were
unable to find very recent data for several indicators, for Fig-
ure 6 (lifetime mental illness)4-6 and for Figures 8 and 9
(military tobacco use), we used secondary sources.
Results
Education
Although smoking prevalence in the United States has
decreased in all education groups over the last one-half
century (Fig. 2), the largest decrease has been among those
who are college-educated. Fifty years ago, smoking prevalence
for all education groups was fairly clustered, with nearly 40%
of college-educated individuals smoking along with approxi-
mately 45% of individuals in all other education groups. Five
decades later, 6.5% of college-educated individuals continue
to smoke, while the prevalence is more than triple that among
those with a high school education or less (23.1%).

 Economists have been particularly interested in disentangling
the causal effect of education on health outcomes, with smok-
ing considered to be a major driver of these outcomes. They
have generally found both a substantial causal role of school-
ing and a strong tendency for schooling to select for factors
such as cognitive ability and early life stability that also drive
smoking rates.7,8
Poverty
Although all income groups experienced overall declines in
smoking over the last few decades, the largest relative
decreases have been with higher socioeconomic groups
(Fig. 3). Research consistently indicates that smoking has a
strong socioeconomic dimension, with the lowest groups
most likely to experience the worst outcomes. Siahpush et al

 use the International Tobacco Control 4-country survey
(which includes the United States) to show that smokers
from socioeconomically disadvantaged groups tend to smoke
more than wealthier smokers and to be more dependent on
nicotine.9 Smokers with low socioeconomic status (SES) face
disproportionate smoking-related illness as a result.10 Addi-
tional factors associated with lower SES, such as unhealthy
diet and higher stress levels, tend to compound their health
risk.11 In 2015 and 2016, current tobacco use prevalence was
about 10% for adults in higher income households (greater
than 400% of the Federal Poverty Level) compared with
almost 25% for adults in households below the poverty line.
Figure 3 illustrates the downward trend for all socioeconomic
groups from 1990 to 2016 for both men and women, but
note that the lowest income group for men experienced a
25% relative decrease (from 40.50% to 30.22%), while the
highest income group experienced a 54% relative drop (from
22.50% to 10.42%). For women, it was a 21% relative
decrease for the lowest income group (from 30.70% to
24.24%), while it was a 59% decline for those in the highest
income group (from 19.00% to 7.87%).
Various other reviews have attempted the difficult task of
allocating the relative causal weight of all the various factors
associated with poverty, or at least of cataloguing the various
ways that poverty is linked to poor health behaviors, such as
smoking.12-14 In addition to other disparities mentioned
explicitly in this review, such as education and geography,
lower income is often associated with challenges to health

 insurance access,15 particularly in states that have maintained
a restrictive Medicaid program.15-17 The rate of current ciga-
rette smoking (28%) for adults who lack health insurance or
rely on public health insurance is double compared with the
rate for those who have private insurance (14%).18
Race/Ethnicity
Among all racial and ethnic groups, there has mostly been a
downward trend for both men and women, but there also
remains considerable variation, as illustrated in Figure 4.
Individuals who are of American Indian or Alaskan Native
descent exhibit the highest smoking prevalence (24.3% men
and 23.4% women), and women in this group also experi-
enced a recent upward trend (after a nearly 2-decade down-
ward trend). Individuals of Asian and Hispanic/Latino
descent demonstrate the lowest prevalence (12.6% men and
3.5% women). The causal mechanisms of these differences
are not well understood, although some research suggests
that sociocultural differences and/or practices may explain
some of the variation.19,20
Mental Illness
The burden from smoking has been particularly high on
individuals struggling with mental illness. Tam et al linked
NHIS data from 1997 through 2009 to the 2011 National
Death Index to construct life tables that enabled the estima-
tion of hazard ratios for smoking status and serious psycho-
logical
distress.
They
reported
that
smoking
among
individuals with a serious psychological distress accounted
for two-thirds of the difference in life expectancy relative to
nonsmokers without a serious psychiatric disorder.21 Evi-
dence suggests that some individuals with mental illness
may have a genetic predisposition toward addiction and/or
may self-medicate using nicotine.22,23 Figure 5 presents
everyday cigarette smoking prevalence among people with a
past-year serious mental illness versus those without a past-
year mental illness. There is a stark gap between the 5% of
the population with a serious recent mental illness versus
those without. Past 30-day cigarette smoking prevalence
among people with a past-year serious mental illness was
more than double those without a past-year mental illness
(27.9% versus 12.9%).
There is also significant variation among different mental
illnesses, as illustrated in Figure 6.4-6 For example, nicotine
addiction has proven to be particularly challenging for many
suffering from psychiatric disorders, such as schizophre-
nia.24 Smoking prevalence was highest among those with
schizophrenia, at nearly 60%. Individuals with such disor-
ders may also experience additional risk factors, such as the
easy availability of tobacco in some treatment centers.25

 Sexual Orientation
Smoking prevalence rates among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgender (LGBT) men and women in the United States are
much higher than those among heterosexuals, as presented in
Figure 7.3 The social stresses of living in a society that can be
hostile to individuals in the LGBT community contribute to
the higher prevalence.26,27 Furthermore, it is particularly well
documented that, for many years, the tobacco industry has mar-
keted specifically to the LGBT community,28 placing advertise-
ments in community media outlets,29 attending pride festivals
to hand out coupons for discounted cigarettes,30 and promoting
their products in LGBT bars to gain customers and leverage
aligned groups in the industry’s fight against smoking bans.31
Military
Persistently higher smoking prevalence in the military has
received scholarly attention in recent years.32,33 Figure 8 illus-
illustrates that, similar to the overall US population, smok-
ing in the military has trended significantly downward in
recent decades. In 1980, more than one-half of military per-
sonnel reported smoking. By 2011, smoking prevalence had
dropped to less than one-quarter. Although unadjusted prev-
alence is still significantly higher than that in the general
population, there has been a notable downward shift after a
spike in the early 2000s.
However, as Figure 9 illustrates, disparities by pay grade
within the military persist.32,34 For service members in the
lowest 4 pay grades of enlisted members (E1-E4), smoking
prevalence remained around 30% in 2011. In contrast,
smoking prevalence in the highest 6 pay grades of commis-
sioned officers (O4-O10) had dropped below 5%. Other
disparities within this population included that smokers
were more often male, high school-educated or less, and sta-
tioned outside of the United States.32
Geography
There are substantial geographic differences in smoking
prevalence. First, smoking prevalence varies considerably
FIGURE 9. Any Past 30-Day Cigarette Use by Pay Grade, All Services, 2011.32 “Grade” describes both rank and pay. The E1 grade represents the
lowest ranked enlisted members (E), continuing rightward to the O10 grade, which represents the highest ranking commissioned officers (O). Pay is
less straightforward: warrant officers (W) are outranked by commissioned officers, but they make very similar base pay (ie, W1 officers receive only
slightly less income than O1 officers). Pay is also determined by years in service (Smith S. United States Military Ranks and Rates. The Balance34).

 across states. Figure 7 shows how these rates vary, from 8.7%
in Utah to 26.2% in Kentucky. There is a notable dark stripe
on the map leading from Michigan to Mississippi, including
several adjacent states in the Midwest and Appalachia, where
smoking prevalence is substantially above the national aver-
age. The Truth Initiative calls this “Tobacco Nation” and
points to several driving factors, including policy, culture, and
the strong and persistent influence of the tobacco industry in
this region.35 Not surprisingly, findings from recent analysis
of tobacco-attributable cancer mortality by state show poorer
outcomes in most Tobacco Nation states.36
In addition to interstate disparities, there are considerable
disparities within states at the county level (and lower). To
demonstrate such disparity, Figure 11 illustrates county-level
smoking prevalence in Ohio. Generally, there is considerably
higher prevalence in the more rural areas, including some in
or bordering on Appalachia. Strong intrastate variation at
the county level can be observed throughout the United
States.37 In addition, geographic disparities exist within
counties across cities, precincts, and neighborhoods.38
Secondhand Smoke
Not surprisingly, secondhand smoke exposure is associated
with demographic characteristics similar to those of active
smoking. Recent estimates suggest that 58 million people,
including 45% of children, are still exposed to secondhand
smoke, especially in the home. Moreover, 40,000 annual
deaths are attributed to secondhand smoke exposure.18 The
prevalence of secondhand smoke exposure in the home
varies by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity, with those
from lower socioeconomic groups in particular experiencing
much greater exposure to secondhand smoke.39,40 However,
some additional factors drive secondhand smoke disparities.
Differences among socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups
may be driven in part by large differences between owners
and renters.40 Housing differences might help to explain
why black nonsmokers of all ages face far greater exposure
to secondhand smoke, as measured by serum cotinine levels,
although there is not a large disparity between black and
white smoking prevalence. In addition to being more likely
to rent, black smokers are less likely to report a (self-
imposed) ban on smoking in the home. Recent US Housing
and Urban Development policy to promote smoke-free
homes and common areas in multiunit public housing seeks
to address this challenge. Although secondhand smoke
exposure has declined across all racial and SES groups, the
lowest SES individuals have experienced the smallest
decline, as has the black population, meaning that the SES

cinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland.

 and racial disparities have worsened over time.39,40 Work-
place smoking is also a driver of exposure to secondhand
smoke, and research suggests that the patterns of those
more likely to be exposed are similar to the smoking trends
described above, including individuals with less education
and in lower socioeconomic groups.41
Discussion
Why the Disparities?
Recent research demonstrates that individuals in specific
groups—including certain education, income, and racial/eth-
nic groups, among others—face increased exposure to tobacco
industry marketing that promotes smoking.42,43 This is often
because of the purposeful targeting of vulnerable populations,
such as working class youth,44 inner cities areas that are pre-
dominantly black and/or low-income,45 and the LGBT com-
munity.28-31 In all cases, the industry is keen to target youth
and young adults, who comprise nearly all of the total smok-
ing uptake. Smoking rates in this population represent a bell-
wether for predicting future smoking patterns.
Disparities may also arise because of environmental fac-
tors that may or may not result from intentional industry
targeting. For example, there are persistent neighborhood
disparities in the tobacco retail environment. Research
shows evidence not only of increased tobacco marketing but
also of higher retailer density in neighborhoods with a larger
proportion of African Americans and same-sex cou-
ples.4,46,47 It is more common for African American teens
and those living in low-income households to be within
walking distance of a tobacco retailer.47 Similarly, a recent
study in the San Francisco Bay area indicated that adult
smokers with serious mental illnesses live in neighborhoods
with twice the tobacco retail density as individuals who do
not have a mental illness. This environmental exposure was
associated with greater nicotine dependence and lower effi-
cacy to quit smoking.5 These causal relationships may work
in both directions: more retailers sell tobacco because there
are more tobacco users, and current tobacco users use more
tobacco because there is heightened exposure to these
tobacco retail environments.
Similarly, many groups disproportionately lack exposure to
effective tobacco control policies and messages. For example,
workplace smoking bans will not encourage cessation among
people who work outdoors or are unemployed. More gener-
ally, per-capita tobacco control expenditures vary considerably
across states, and higher levels are associated with lower smok-
ing prevalence among both youths48 and adults.49
Addressing Disparities
Eliminating disparities in tobacco use through approaches
specifically geared toward these populations is vital for
achieving not only broader prevalence reduction goals but
also improved health equity. The 2014 Surgeon General’s
Report recognized the need to reduce smoking prevalence
“more rapidly than the current trajectory” and called for
eliminating the use of combustible tobacco products, which
are responsible for 480,000 deaths in the United States each
year (see National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention
and Health Promotion, p 870-87110). There is clearly a
need to target interventions and make cessation services
more widely available, particularly to vulnerable population
groups. These innovations should include creative efforts to
extend traditional approaches to groups that have proven
difficult to reach in addition to novel approaches that are
tailored to the subpopulation of interest. Some examples of
novel and innovative interventions and tools that have
recently been developed and implemented at the national,
state, and community levels in the United States to address
smoking disparities include the following:
� The US Food and Drug Administration’s “This Free
Life” campaign aimed at the LGBT community50;
� The establishment of strategic partnerships with the 2-1-1
information and referral system to promote smoke-free,
low-income homes and to support cessation among 2-1-1
callers who are disproportionally low-income, unemployed,
and/or uninsured4,51;
� Reducing sales of untaxed or low-tax cigarettes on
tribal lands4;
� Setting minimum floor pricing policies across states4;
� The
development
of
simplified
and
standardized
tobacco-assessment tools for retail settings to allow
state and local partners to record their own retail data
about product packaging, price, and placement to
inform regulation of the retail environment4;
� The development of antitobacco media campaigns using
nonsmokers and/or former smokers to help smokers to
quit, such as the Tips From Former Smokers campaign52;
� Using social branding interventions to counter the tobacco
industry’s marketing efforts in social environments like
bars and nightclubs and on social media to aggressively
target young adults and groups outside of the cultural
mainstream53-55;
� Expand health care access among low-income adults
with attendant smoking-cessation counseling and medi-
cation benefits via Medicaid expansion and insurance
exchange subsidies; and
� Support the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s ban on smoking in public housing.56
Many high-income countries have enjoyed considerable
success in reducing adult smoking prevalence over the past
decades, but very few have succeeded in lowering it below
10%. Reducing prevalence among disadvantaged population

113
 groups tends to be particularly challenging. Given the con-
tinuing nicotine dependence of many smokers who are eco-
nomically or socially challenged, to achieve further dramatic
reductions in smoking prevalence in addition to continuing to
vigorously use existing evidence-based interventions, additional
innovative efforts are necessary to sufficiently increase cessation
rates and prevent initiation in those groups.
Limitations
Because the emphases and goals of different national surveys
vary, we were unable to rely on the same source of data for
every figure in this research. Where possible, we relied on the
NHIS to produce nationally representative estimates of
tobacco use disparities over time. Unfortunately, the NHIS
does not capture the proper measure of mental health needed
for our work, which made us turn to the NSDUH for that
information. Because neither the NHIS nor the NSDUH
public data set contained state-level or county-level data, we
used the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System, which
provides such geographic information. Although the data sets
do not produce the same point estimates of cigarette smoking
prevalence, there is ample evidence that these data sets are
capturing the same larger trends in the data over time.
Conclusions
The high prevalence of cigarette smoking among vulnerable
populations is one of the most pressing challenges facing
the tobacco control community. Included among these pop-
ulations are individuals in lower education and/or socioeco-
nomic groups, from certain racial/ethnic groups, in the
LGBT community, with mental illness, in the military, and
in certain geographic areas. The main challenge is that,
although the evidence demonstrates that traditional tobacco
control measures are having positive health effects for most
groups, the effects have often not been as large as needed
for some. More attention to and support for promising
novel interventions, in addition to new attempts at reaching
these populations through conventional interventions that
have proven to be effective, are crucial going forward to find
new ways to address these disparities. �
