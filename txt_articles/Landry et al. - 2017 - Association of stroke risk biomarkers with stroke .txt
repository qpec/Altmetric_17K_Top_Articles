Essentials
• Stroke symptom history predicts future stroke and may
indicate prior unrecognized stroke.
• We studied associations of stroke symptoms with stroke
risk biomarkers.
• Several stroke risk biomarkers were independently asso-
ciated with stroke symptom history.
• Findings support a hypothesis that stroke symptoms
may represent unrecognized stroke.
Summary. Background: History of stroke symptoms in the
absence of prior diagnosed stroke or transient ischemic
attack (TIA) is associated with future stroke risk, as are
biomarkers
of
inflammation,
cardiac
function
and
hemostasis. Objective: To better elucidate the pathobiol-
ogy of stroke symptoms, we studied associations of these
biomarkers with history of stroke symptoms. Methods:
The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in
Stroke (REGARDS) cohort enrolled 30 239 black and
white Americans age 45 years and older in 2003–7. In
cross-sectional analyses in a random sample of 960 partic-
ipants without prior stroke or TIA, levels of N-terminal
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), fibrinogen,
factor VIII (FVIII), factor XI (FXI), C-reactive protein
(CRP) and D-dimer were studied in relation to self-
reported
history
of
six
sudden
onset
stroke
symp-
toms. Results: There were 190 participants with at least
one stroke symptom and 770 without. Adjusting for age,
race, sex and stroke risk factors, NT-proBNP, FXI, CRP
and D-dimer in the top vs. bottom quartile were associ-
ated with prevalent stroke symptoms with odds ratios
2.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45–4.98), 1.65 (95%
CI, 1.00–2.73), 2.21 (95% CI, 1.32–3.71) and 2.14 (95%
CI, 1.22–3.75), respectively. Conclusions: Strong associa-
tions of stroke risk biomarkers with stroke symptoms in
persons without a clinical history of cerebrovascular dis-
ease support a hypothesis that some of these stroke symp-
toms
represent
unrecognized
cerebrovascular
disease.
Future
work
is
needed
to
determine
whether
these
biomarkers identify persons with stroke symptoms who
have a particularly high stroke risk.

Introduction
Stroke symptom history can be ascertained using self-
report questionnaires in persons without a history of cere-
brovascular disease. Stroke symptoms, as defined by such
questionnaires, are common among people without a clin-
ical history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA),
present in 18% of adults ≥ 45 years of age in one study
[1]. Moreover, presence of stroke symptoms, ascertained
with these questionnaires, is associated with increased risk
of future stroke and mortality [2–6]. These findings under-
score the importance of evaluating reasons why stroke
symptoms are associated with stroke risk. A prior study
demonstrated that six individual stroke symptoms on
such self-report tools are not uniformly associated with

 stroke risk factors, emphasizing the importance of further
inquiry into the underlying causes of these symptoms [7].
In recent years several promising biomarkers have been
reported in association with stroke risk and mortality. These
include inflammation biomarkers such as C-reactive protein
(CRP)
[8,9]
and
fibrinogen
[10,11],
cardiac
function
biomarkers such as N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic pep-
tide (NT-proBNP) [12–15], and markers of hemostasis, such
as the procoagulant factors [11,16] and D-dimer [17]. Study
of associations of these biomarkers with self-reported stroke
symptoms could provide insight into whether stroke symp-
toms represent silent cerebrovascular disease.
We hypothesized that, among those without history of
stroke or TIA, NT-proBNP and biomarkers of inflamma-
tion and hemostasis would be higher among individuals
with a history of stroke symptoms compared with those
without such history, and that observed associations
would be independent of other stroke risk factors.
Methods
Subjects
Between 2003 and 2007, the Reasons for Geographic and
Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study enrolled
30 239 adults ≥ 45 years old, 42% black and 58% white,
45% men and 55% women, from the contiguous USA to
study reasons for geographic and black–white disparities
in stroke mortality [18]. The study was approved by insti-
tutional
review
boards
of
participating
centers
and
detailed study methods have been published [1,18]. Partic-
ipants were recruited from commercially available lists
(Genesys, Inc, Daly City, CA, USA) by a mailing fol-
lowed by a phone call. For verbally consenting partici-
pants, a telephone interview was conducted to collect
demographics, risk factors and medical history. Trained
professionals then visited participants’ homes to collect
written consent, fasting morning blood and urine samples,
blood pressure and other physical measurements, medica-
tion inventory and an electrocardiogram (ECG).
Blood was collected in a standardized fashion with
phlebotomy and sample processing methods previously
described [19]. Blood was kept on ice and centrifuged,
with serum or plasma separated within 120 min of phle-
botomy. Samples were shipped overnight on gel ice packs
to the University of Vermont Laboratory for Clinical Bio-
chemistry Research. Samples were re-centrifuged at 4 °C
for 30 000 g, and stored at �80 °C.
For this study we used data from a random sample of
1099 participants stratified for age, sex and race who were
selected for a prior case-cohort study [13]. Strata were
used
to
ensure
sufficient
representation
of
high-risk
groups to achieve: 50% black, 50% white; 50% women,
50% men; and age groups 45–54 (20%), 55–64 (20%),
65–74 (25%), 75–84 (25%) and ≥ 85 (10%) years. Partici-
pants with self-reported history of stroke (n = 82) or TIA
(n = 57) were excluded from analysis, leaving 960 partici-
pants for analysis.
Study definitions
Stroke symptoms were defined as positive response to any
of these six questions from the Questionnaire for Verifying
Stroke-Free Status [20]: sudden onset of any of unilateral
painless weakness, unilateral numbness or dead feeling,
painless loss of vision unilaterally or bilaterally, hemifield
vision loss, loss of ability to understand what people were
saying, or loss of ability to express oneself verbally or in
writing [21]. Pre-baseline stroke or TIA was defined by self-
report elicited using the following questions. ‘Were you
ever told by a physician that you had a stroke?’ ‘Were you
ever told by a physician that you had a mini-stroke or TIA,
also known as a transient ischemic attack?’
Age, race, sex and current smoking were determined by
self-report. Hypertension was defined as self-reported use
of blood pressure lowering medications or blood pressure
≥ 140/90 mmHg. Diabetes was defined as fasting glucose
≥ 126 mg dL�1 (or non-fasting glucose ≥ 200 mg dL�1) or
self-reported medication for glucose control. Dyslipidemia
was defined as triglycerides ≥ 240 mg dL�1, low-density
lipoprotein ≥ 160 mg dL�1 or high-density lipoprotein
≤ 40 mg dL�1. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was
classified by ECG [22]. Atrial fibrillation was defined as
self-report or ECG evidence. History of heart disease was
defined as self-reported pre-baseline myocardial infarction
(MI), coronary artery bypass surgery, coronary angio-
plasty/stenting, or evidence of MI on ECG.
Laboratory methods
We previously reported that the studied biomarkers were
accurately measured using REGARDS sample processing
methods [19]. D-dimer was measured on the STAR
automated coagulation analyzer, using an immuno-turbi-
dometric assay (Liatest D-DI; Diagnostica Stago, Parsip-
pany, NJ, USA) with coefficient of variation (CV) ranging
from 5% to 14% at different levels. Factors VIII and XI
antigen were determined using enzyme linked immunosor-
bent assays (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend,
IN, USA) with CVs of 4–7%. Fibrinogen antigen and CRP
were measured using the BNII nephelometer (N Antiserum
to Human Fibrinogen, N High-sensitivity CRP; Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL, USA) with CVs of
3–5%
and
2.1–5.7%,
respectively.
NT-proBNP
was
measured by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay using
the Roche Elecsys 2010 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indi-
anapolis, IN, USA; CV < 5%).
Statistical methods
Sample weights, using inverse probability weighting, from
the cohort sample were applied to all analyses to report

 results reflecting the entire REGARDS cohort with stroke
symptoms
(n = 4990)
and
controls
(n = 21 469).
NT-proBNP, FVIII, FXI, CRP and D-dimer were log-
transformed when necessary to correct for their skewed
distributions.
Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio
of presence of any stroke symptom by quartiles of each
biomarker, using the first quartile as the reference group.
We also calculated the odds ratio of stroke symptoms per
standard deviation (SD) increment of each biomarker.
Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex and race. Model 2 was
further adjusted for Framingham stroke risk factors (his-
tory of heart disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperten-
sion medication use, current smoking, systolic blood
pressure, and LVH by ECG), statin use and regular
aspirin use. Interaction terms for each biomarker with
race and sex were tested with a P value to denote signifi-
cance of < 0.10.
We
used
two
strategies
to
study
associations
of
biomarkers with individual stroke symptoms. Logistic
regression
models
following
the
above
method
were
undertaken
for
each
stroke
symptom.
In
addition,
because there were relatively low numbers of partici-
pants
with
some
stroke
symptoms,
we
used
linear
regression to examine each individual stroke symptom
as
a
predictor
of
each
biomarker
as
the
outcome,
expressed as the level divided by the SD to yield stan-
dardized regression coefficients for the association of
each stroke symptom with a 1 SD higher level of each
biomarker. To minimize the impact of false-positive
findings due to multiple testing we only performed mul-
tivariable analysis for Model 2 if, in Model 1, a P-value
< 0.10 was observed for the association of a biomarker
with a stroke symptom.
Results
Among 960 included participants, 190 (20%) reported a
history of any individual stroke symptom, and 770 (80%)
without a history of stroke symptoms were considered
controls. Participants with stroke symptoms were older,
more likely to be black and more likely to have a history
of heart disease than controls (Table 1). Those with
stroke symptoms also had higher levels of all biomarkers
than controls, although this difference was small for fib-
rinogen and FVIII (Table 1).
The most common stroke symptom was sudden unilat-
eral numbness (n = 77), followed by sudden painless uni-
lateral weakness (n = 66), sudden loss of vision in one or
both eyes (n = 51), sudden loss of ability to communicate
verbally or in writing (n = 40), sudden hemifield vision
loss (n = 33), and sudden loss of ability to understand
people (n = 32).
As shown in Table 2, in Model 1, NT-proBNP, CRP
and D-dimer in the top vs. bottom quartiles were each
associated with history of any stroke symptom, with odds
ratios (ORs) of 1.99–3.06. The SD increments of these
biomarkers and higher FXI (on the log scale where
appropriate) were also significantly associated with inci-
dence of any stroke symptom, with ORs of 1.21–1.54.
The upper three quartiles of CRP and NT-pro-BNP were
all associated with increased odds of stroke symptoms. In
Model 2, the ORs for biomarkers were little changed; the
highest
quartile
of
NT-proBNP,
CRP
and
D-dimer
remained strongly associated with a history of any stroke
symptom, as was the highest quartile of FXI. In Model 2,
SD increments of NT-proBNP, FXI and CRP also
remained significantly associated with a history of any
stroke symptom, whereas the association of D-dimer per-
sisted but lost statistical significance. Fibrinogen and
FVIII were not associated with a history of stroke symp-
toms in the minimally or fully adjusted model. There were
no significant interactions by race or sex for any of the
biomarkers.
Table 3 shows the ORs of individual stroke symptoms
by biomarker levels. Because of low numbers of partici-
pants with some individual stroke symptoms, analysis
was limited to three of the six stroke symptoms: sudden
onset of unilateral numbness, painless unilateral weakness
and painless vision loss in one or both eyes. Similar to
analyses in Table 2, there was little confounding by
stroke risk factors. In Model 2, the top quartile of CRP
was associated with a 2.39-fold increased odds of unilat-
eral numbness (95% CI, 1.08, 5.26) and a 4.77-fold
increased odds of painless vision loss (95% CI, 1.92–
11.83), but CRP was not significantly associated with

 unilateral weakness (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.70–3.68). Con-
versely, the top quartile of D-dimer was associated with
increased odds of unilateral weakness (OR, 3.87; 95% CI,
1.55–9.64). Higher D-dimer was associated with over
twice the odds of unilateral numbness or vision loss but
these odds ratios were not statistically significant. There
was no association of NT-proBNP, fibrinogen, FVIII or
FXI quartiles with unilateral numbness, vision loss or
unilateral weakness in fully adjusted models. Considering
SD increments of all the biomarkers (on log scale where
appropriate), the only positive association in adjusted
models was for CRP and painless loss of vision (OR,
1.38; 95% CI, 1.09–1.75).
Similar to the logistic regression results in Table 3, in
linear regression analysis of associations of stroke symp-
toms with biomarker levels, shown in Table 4, higher
CRP was also associated with painless vision loss, and
D-dimer and FXI were associated with unilateral painless
weakness in Models 1 and 2. In contrast to the results in
Table 3, in Model 2, NT-proBNP was associated with
multiple stroke symptoms, including painless vision loss,
hemifield vision loss, and loss of ability to understand
others. Fibrinogen was associated with loss of ability to
communicate; however, this association was attenuated in
Model 2.
Discussion
In this national cohort of US black and white adults,
higher levels of the stroke risk biomarkers NT-proBNP,
CRP,
FXI
and
D-dimer
were
each
associated
with
increased odds of prevalent stroke symptoms in partici-
pants without prior stroke or TIA. Associations were
strongest
for
NT-proBNP
and
CRP.
Analysis
of
biomarker associations with individual stroke symptoms
was somewhat limited by power; however, distinct pat-
terns of associations did emerge for the three more com-
mon stroke symptoms. Strong associations were seen
between CRP and painless vision loss in one or both eyes
as well as between D-dimer and unilateral painless weak-
ness. The robust association between NT-proBNP and
history of any stroke symptom appeared to be because of
its association with multiple individual stroke symptoms
rather than a more specific pattern.
Prior REGARDS reports demonstrated the clinical
importance of a history of stroke symptoms as defined
here [1,3–5]. We are not aware of other studies examining
stroke biomarker levels in relation to history of stroke
symptoms. Prior studies showed an association of NT-
proBNP and CRP with MRI-defined silent brain infarcts
[23,24]. Silent stroke is common in middle and older age

 [25–27], and is strongly associated with future stroke and
mortality [28,29]. Using similar stroke symptoms to the
present study, Windham et al. demonstrated an associa-
tion of stroke symptoms with silent brain infarction and
clinical stroke [5]. These studies, taken together with the
current findings, suggest that a history of stroke symp-
toms
represents
unrecognized
cerebrovascular
disease,
and the biomarker associations observed here support
that hypothesis.
Previous studies reported associations between the stud-
ied biomarkers and future stroke risk, with NT-proBNP
having the most robust relationship [8–15]. In this analy-
sis most of these biomarkers were also associated with a
history of stroke symptoms, except for FVIII and fibrino-
gen. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that
FVIII and fibrinogen relate more closely to more severe
strokes that are more likely to come to medical attention.
The associations of NT-proBNP, CRP, D-dimer and
FXI with a history of stroke symptoms supports our pre-
sent understanding of the involvement of heart disease,
inflammation and thrombosis in stroke pathophysiology.
Furthermore, our analysis of individual stroke symptoms
showed patterns of association with specific biomarkers,
suggesting each symptom may have a unique risk factor
profile. For example, an inverse relationship between
FVIII and loss of ability to communicate might indicate
small brain hemorrhage in association with lower FVIII.
The variable patterns of association that emerged in our
present study agree with prior studies demonstrating

Stroke risk biomarkers and stroke symptoms 25
 non-uniformity in associations between stroke symptoms
and stroke risk factors [1,7].
Strengths of this study include the use of a national
general population sample of black and white adults with
objectively measured risk factors. There are also limita-
tions to consider. Prior validation studies of the Question-
naire for Verifying Stroke-Free Status demonstrated high
sensitivity but modest specificity in detecting stroke; posi-
tive answers to the questions may be given because of
conditions unrelated to cerebrovascular disease [21]. For
example, weakness or numbness may be a result of recent
surgery; higher D-dimer or CRP might be expected in
such cases. We believe the impact of this is small because
participants
might
be
less
likely
to
undertake
their
REGARDS enrolment in-home visit right after acute ill-
ness. Another limitation is low power for associations of
biomarkers with individual stroke symptoms as a result
of relatively few participants with some symptoms. We
used linear regression analysis to try to overcome this,
and associations were mostly consistent with the logistic
regression analysis, supporting the validity of the associa-
tions found for rarer stroke symptoms only in the linear
regression, including hemifield vision loss, loss of ability
to understand and loss of speech or ability to write.
Finally, REGARDS does not have brain imaging to con-
firm that stroke symptoms represent cerebrovascular dis-
ease and confirm that biomarker changes with stroke
symptoms are clinically important.
In conclusion, we report associations of NT-proBNP,
CRP, FXI and D-dimer with presence of a history of
stroke symptoms, and with some individual symptoms.
In the right clinical context, elevated levels of these
biomarkers
may
suggest
undiagnosed
cerebrovascular
disease. Future work is needed to determine whether
these biomarkers identify persons with a history of
stroke symptoms who have a particularly high risk of
stroke.
