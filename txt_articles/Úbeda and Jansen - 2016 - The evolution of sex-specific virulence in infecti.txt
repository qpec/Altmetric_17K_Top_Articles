The evolution of sex-specific virulence in infectious
diseases
Francisco U
´beda1 & Vincent A.A. Jansen1
Fatality rates of infectious diseases are often higher in men than women. Although this
difference is often attributed to a stronger immune response in women, we show that
differences in the transmission routes that the sexes provide can result in evolution favouring
pathogens with sex-specific virulence. Because women can transmit pathogens during
pregnancy, birth or breast-feeding, pathogens adapt, evolving lower virulence in women. This
can resolve the long-standing puzzle on progression from Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus
Type 1 (HTLV-1) infection to lethal Adult T-cell Leukaemia (ATL); a progression that is more
likely in Japanese men than women, while it is equally likely in Caribbean women and men.
We argue that breastfeeding, being more prolonged in Japan than in the Caribbean, may have
driven the difference in virulence between the two populations. Our finding signifies the
importance of investigating the differences in genetic expression profile of pathogens in
males and females.

 T
he progression and fatality rates (virulence) of many
infectious diseases that do not affect sex-specific organs
differ substantially between men and women1,2. For
example, infection with the tubercle bacillus, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (MTB), may progress to active tuberculosis disease
with high probability of causing death. Men infected with MTB
are 1.5 times more likely to die than infected women are (shown
in refs 3–5). Oral infection with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)
may progress to tonsil cancer, which is lethal. Men infected with
HPV are five times more likely to develop cancer than women are
(shown in refs 6–11). Men are at least twice more likely than
women to develop Hodgkin’s lymphoma following infectious
mononucleosis–related Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection12.
Infection with Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1
(HTLV-1) may progress to Adult T-cell Leukaemia (ATL)
causing death. In Japan, men infected with HTLV-1 are
between 2 and 3.5 times more likely to develop ATL and die
than women are (shown in refs 13–15).
In spite of the mounting evidence suggesting that infectious
diseases behave differently in each sex medical doctors tend to
provide the same treatment to male and female patients1,16,17.
One of the reasons why a sex-specific treatment has not been
implemented is that the causes of sex-differences in virulence are
not well understood18. The prevailing explanation posits that the
interaction between sex-hormones and the immune system
renders men more vulnerable to the action of the pathogen
than women1,16. In general, females tend to mount a stronger
immune response that helps them to clear infections faster and
reduces the risk of persistence—although this response helps to
fight infecting pathogens, it makes women more susceptible to
immune pathologies1,16. While this hypothesis may account for
some of the sex-differences observed, it does not provide a fully
satisfactory answer; most prominently it does not explain why the
sex-differences in virulence do not become apparent immediately
after puberty—when sex-hormones are first produced—but
almost a decade later19.
Seeking to improve our understanding of sex-differences in
virulence, we move away from host-centred hypotheses—as
previous explanations are—towards an alternative pathogen-
centred hypothesis20. We propose that natural selection acting
differently on pathogens in male and female hosts leads to
pathogens exhibiting different virulence in men and women.
There is some evidence for the existence of such sex-specific
strategies: bacteria can have different strategies to exploit their
hosts, depending on whether the host are male or female. For
instance,
several
strictly
maternally
transmitted
bacterial
symbionts selectively kill male, but not female offspring21.
Pasteuria ramosa, a parasite of Daphnia magna, can cause
gigantism when in females, but not in males22. We will explore
which factors lead to selection for differential exploitation
strategies in pathogens residing in female and male hosts, and
focus on the evolutionary implications of the different routes of
transmission provided by each sex to the pathogens that they
host. While both sexes are vectors of transmission to another
individual in the same population (horizontal transmission),
transmission from parent to offspring through pregnancy, birth
or breast-feeding (maternal vertical transmission; henceforth
vertical transmission) is limited to women.
Here we explore whether this fundamental biological difference
alone can drive the evolution of sex-specific virulence in the
pathogen.We advance evolutionary theory by formulating and
solving analytically an extension of the classical susceptible-
infected-recovered individuals (SIR) model23 that incorporates
vertical and horizontal transmission between male and female
hosts. We use this model to explore whether mixed transmission
is expected to result in the evolution of sex-differences in
virulence. We apply our results to explain the observed
differences in virulence between men and women infected with
HTLV-1 in two endemic regions: Japan and the Caribbean.
Results
Model formulation. We extend the classical SIR model23
incorporating vertical and horizontal transmission between
male and female hosts (see Fig. 1 and Methods for details).
We solve this model allowing pathogens to exhibit different
virulence in men and women.
There is a large literature on epidemiological models exploring
the evolution of virulence in pathogens that are horizontally
transmitted
only24,25.
There
is
a
limited
literature
on
epidemiological models exploring the evolution of virulence in
pathogens that are vertically transmitted only26, showing that
natural
selection
disfavours
pathogens
that
are
vertically
transmitted only (when vertical transmission is uniparental) if
they exhibit any degree of virulence26,27. Pathogens can only be
maintained if they exhibit some special feature that compensates
for the fitness loss caused by the death of their host26,28.
Epidemiological models of pathogens that are only horizontally
or vertically transmitted do not consider pathogens that may
exhibit different virulence in men and women (but see ref. 29 for
sex-specific virulence as a result of different resistance of male
and female hosts).
There is also a large literature on behavioural models exploring
the evolution of male killing by pathogens transmitted exclusively
through
cytoplasmic
inheritance
(male-killers)30,31,
that
is,
equivalent to male limited virulence in pathogens that are
vertically transmitted only. Natural selection does not disfavour
male-killers because their virulence is limited to the sex that does
not transmit them and thus does not translate in any fitness

 loss32. However, natural selection favours male-killers only when
the death of a male translates into greater fitness of females
closely related to the male-killer (fitness compensation)28.
Here we formulate an epidemiological model exploring the
evolution of virulence in pathogens that are horizontally and
vertically transmitted (mixed transmission). When there is
mixed transmission, pathogens that are vertically transmitted
can
be
maintained
because
they
are
also
horizontally
transmitted and not because they exhibit any form of fitness
compensation26,27,33,34.
Because
of
their
complex
nature,
epidemiological models of mixed transmission are rare27,33–36,
and they do not consider pathogens that may have different
virulence in men and women. Thus, to the extent of our
knowledge, ours is the first epidemiological model to consider
pathogens with a sex-specific virulence. Most importantly, this
model allows us to investigate the evolution of sex-specific
virulence
in
pathogens
causing
infectious
diseases—where
horizontal transmission plays a role—when the only difference
between the sexes is the presence of vertical transmission in
women.
In our model, infection can take place either through vertical
transmission at a rate a or horizontal transmission at a rate b per
contact (Fig. 1). Horizontal transmission can either be from males
or females, that is bm and bf, where subscripts m and f denote
males and females. Contacts can be established between any of
the sexes, taking place at rates gmm, gmf, gfm, and gff with the first
subscript indicating origin and the second destination. We
assume that the number of contacts per unit of time is
independent of the number of individuals in the population.
An infected individual either recovers at a rate s, dies from causes
unrelated to the infection at a rate m (natural mortality), or dies
from causes related to the infection at a rate n (virulence) (Fig. 1).
Therefore, infections are lost from the population at a rate d equal
to the sum of these rates (d ¼ s þ m þ n; Fig. 1). Another way of
interpreting d is as the reciprocal of the average duration of the
infection: the higher the d, the shorter the average duration of the
infection will be. The rate of loss of infection d is the pathogen’s
strategy to exploit its host (exploitation strategy). Crucially,
we allow the pathogen’s exploitation strategy to be different in
men (dm) and women (df) (Fig. 1).
Trade-off between virulence and recovery and transmission.
The higher the virulence n, (and therefore the shorter the
duration of the infection), the higher the horizontal transmission
rate b37–40, that is b0(d)40 where prime denotes the derivative
(see
Supplementary
Methods,
Supplementary
Table
1
for
the notation used). We make the assumption—standard in
evolutionary
epidemiology
models24,25,41—that
there
is
a
saturating trade-off between the horizontal transmission rate of
a pathogen b from males and females, that is bm and bf, and its
virulence n in males and females, that is nm and nf, mediated by
the sex-specific strategies dm and df (refs 24,25,41), that is bm(dm),
bf(df) and nm(dm), nf(df). Following classic vertical transmission
models33,34
we
make
the
assumption
that
the
vertical
transmission of a pathogen, a, is independent of its virulence,
n. Because we are interested in researching whether adding
vertical transmission favours the pathogen to have different
strategies in men and women (that is, whether evolution favours
values of dm and df that are not equal), we make the conservative
assumption that the transmission-virulence trade-off is the same
in pathogens residing in hosts of either sex, that is bm ¼ bf ¼ b
and nm ¼ nf ¼ n. Because transmission and virulence depend
on the sex-specific exploitation strategies, this allows for the
transmission and virulence of pathogens in women (b(df)
and n(df)) to be different from those residing in men (b(dm)
and n(dm)).
ESS for a non-sex-specific strategy. We derive the fitness
of a mutant pathogen and the exploitation strategy that once
established in the population cannot be beaten by any alternative
exploitation strategy (ESS)32,42. We do this by finding the
exploitation for which the selection gradient is zero (see Methods

summary of results.
Using a graphical method43 to analyse result (1) we confirm
existing results indicating that a pathogen that is horizontally and
vertically transmitted evolves to be less virulent than a pathogen
that is horizontally transmitted only (Fig. 3a)34,44. Using the same
graphical method to analyse results (2) and (3) we make two
novel predictions: first, a pathogen that is horizontally and
vertically transmitted is under selective pressure to evolve sex-
specific virulence with lower virulence in females than males
(Fig. 3b). The intuitive reason is that the existence of an
additional route of transmission makes the life of hosts that
transmit vertically—females but not males—more valuable to the
pathogen. Second, the greater the vertical transmission the greater
the difference in virulence between males and females a pathogen
is selected for (Fig. 4). Therefore, given two populations that
differ in their rates of vertical transmission, sex-specific virulence
is more likely to be observed in the population with the greater
rate of vertical transmission. Although this result is generic, the
magnitude of the difference can depend on the model parameters
(Supplementary Methods).
Evolutionary predictions are often hard to validate. However,
in this case there is a unique natural experiment that allows us to
test our prediction. HTLV-1 is a retrovirus that is horizontally
transmitted via sexual intercourse and vertically transmitted via
breast-feeding13. Infection with HTLV-1 can progress to ATL
that is lethal. The Tax protein—encoded by the viral gene
tax—orchestrates the oncogenic potential of the virus45,46, and
therefore expression of the Tax protein is positively correlated to
the virulence of the pathogen. The presence of anti-Tax
antibodies
is
also
an
independent
risk
factor
for
sexual
transmission47
but
not
for
transmission
through
breast-
feeding48. Therefore, the synthesis of Tax by HTLV-1 generates
a trade-off between horizontal transmission and virulence in
accordance with the assumptions of our model.
HTLV-1 is highly prevalent in two foci located in Southern
Japan and the Caribbean13. These foci differ in the relative
importance of each transmission route with breast-feeding being
more important in Japan and sexual intercourse being more
important in the Caribbean. This claim is sustained by three
observations: (i) in Japan the spatial distribution of HTLV-1 has a
patchy structure characteristic of vertical transmission49–51 while
in
the
Caribbean
the
distribution
is
more
uniform52,53;
(ii)
HTLV-1
transmission
through
breast-feeding
(vertical
transmission) is not sex-biased but transmission through sexual
contact (horizontal transmission) is female-biased. In Japan
prevalence of HTLV-1 is unbiased early in life and female biased
later in life (from age 40-50) which is consistent with vertical
transmission being more important there50,51,54 while in the
Caribbean prevalence of HTLV-1 is female biased all through
adult life (from age 20)53,55; (iii) Japanese women include breast-
milk in their children’s diet for longer time and in greater
proportion than Caribbean women56–58 thus increasing the rate
of vertical transmission per child59.
That vertical transmission rate is larger in Japan than in the
Caribbean leads us to predict that HTLV-1 should be less virulent
in women relative to men in Japan than in the Caribbean (Fig. 5).
This prediction is borne out by epidemiological data: Japanese
men infected with HTLV-1 are between 2 and 3.5 times more
likely to develop ATL than Japanese women are13,14,45. In
contrast, Caribbean men infected with HTLV-1 are as likely to
develop ATL as Caribbean women13,52,60 (Fig. 6). While it would
be possible that this difference is caused by men being worse at
fighting infectious diseases than women are in Japan but not in
Jamaica it is unlikely. The male-to-female mortality ratio because
of infectious diseases is 1.04 in Japan and 1.11 in Jamaica (GBD
2013 (ref. 61)). Notice that we would need the mortality ratio of
those already infected in each country (which is not available) to
provide a definitive answer but these figures suggest that the
health of men relative to women in these countries do not differ
significantly. There is also some indication that the virus acts

 differently between these two locations: significantly fewer
Japanese carriers show an anti-Tax antibody response than
Caribbean carriers do, which implies that the virus acts differently
in the two regions and produces less Tax protein, and thus less
leukaemia, in Japan45.
We
suggest
that
the
geographical
differences
regarding
progression to ATL that have puzzled scientists in the last two
decades13,14,45 are, at least in part, caused by a sex-specific
adaptation of HTLV-1 virulence. In Japan, where the importance
of breast-feeding transmission relative to sexual transmission
is
greater,
natural
selection
on
HTLV-1
favours
slower
progression to ATL in women than men thus preserving
women as a viral route of transmission. However, in the
Caribbean where the importance of breast-feeding relative to
sexual transmission is lower, natural selection on HTLV-1 does
not favour any difference in progression to ATL between women
and men.
Discussion
Our work shows that natural selection favours pathogens causing
differential mortality in men and women when they are
horizontally and vertically transmitted. In particular, pathogens
are expected to evolve a degree of male virulence equal to that of
pathogens in a population without vertical transmission and a
degree of female virulence lower than that of pathogens in a
population without vertical transmission (Fig. 3). Alternatively,
pathogens are expected to evolve a degree of male virulence
higher than that of pathogens in a population with mixed
transmission but without sex-specific virulence and a degree of
female virulence lower than that of pathogens in a population
with mixed transmission but without sex-specific virulence
(Figs 3 and 4). The intuitive reason why is that females, but not
males, provide an additional route of transmission, making these
hosts more valuable to the pathogen.
Our model predicts that pathogens that are transmitted
horizontally and vertically through breastfeeding are more likely
to evolve lower virulence in women in societies which breast-feed
more or longer (greater rates of vertical transmission). This
prediction matches the sex-specific virulence of HTLV-1 in Japan
where vertical transmission is significant and the absence of
differences in virulence in male and female hosts of the same
virus in the Caribbean where vertical transmission is less
important. Interestingly, this implies a social dilemma where
extended breast-feeding practices may result, in the long run, in
saving the life of women (who may experience a less virulent
infection) by risking the lives of their children (who are more
likely to acquire their mother’s infection). A similar pattern is
found in MTB, HPV and EBV which are all infections that can be
transmitted from mother to child, and all these pathogens are
significantly more virulent in males than in females. We hope this
match between predictions and data will motivate the collection
of more epidemiological data on sex-specific progression on other
diseases that can ultimately validate the link between vertical
transmission and sex-specific virulence.
Our work advances existing theory on the evolution of
virulence by considering pathogens that can induce different
mortality in male and female hosts. We provide a general analytic
solution for the evolutionarily stable strategy of a pathogen that
can be transmitted horizontally and vertically. This solution can
accommodate any sex-specific contact structure and other
sex-specific demographic parameters of their host. Furthermore,
this solution can account for sex-specific (and non-sex-specific)
virulence of the pathogen.

 Our work puts the spotlight on pathogens responsible for
infectious diseases as the potential cause of the observed
difference in virulence between men and women. We model a
fundamental biological difference between men and women—
vertical transmission through breast-feeding, live birth or other
means—and show that natural selection favours a departure in
virulence between the sexes. Our work assumes no other
biological difference between men and women, but in practice
of course there are. Less fundamental differences, like sex-specific
rates of horizontal transmission, sex-specific contact structures,
may add to the difference in virulence between the sexes that can
be attributed to the pathogen.
Our work questions the prevailing hypothesis that observed
differences in virulence between the sexes have to be explained by
differences in the reaction of the immune systems of men and
women to an infection. On the debate of what causes the observed
differences between the sexes (hormones, genes) we move away
from hosts, where the debate is centred, to bring the pathogen’s
eye view. We argue that the cause can lie in the action of the
pathogen and that the immune system of hosts alone will not
provide a fully satisfactory answer—the action of pathogens alone
will not either.

sex-specific differences in virulence focuses on the expression

 profile of host genes18 our work invites to compare the expression
profile of pathogen genes in pathogens infecting men and women.
Current medical thinking implies manipulating the expression of
host genes underpinning the immune reaction of men to provide
an immune response in men similar to that in women. If evidence
were to be found of different expression profiles of pathogen
genes in pathogens infecting different sexes, medical research
could attempt manipulating the cues used by pathogens to
determine the sex of their host. By manipulating these cues, it
may be possible to switch on the phenotype for women’s
virulence in pathogens infecting men thus reducing the mortality
they induce.
A better understanding of what causes the observed virulence
differences between men and women should bring us closer
to
implementing
sex-specific
medical
treatment
improving
therapeutic choices.
Methods
The model. Here we develop a mathematical model that incorporates horizontal
and vertical transmission between male and female hosts.
As we show in Supplementary Methods, a generic model for the change over
time, t, in the fraction of susceptible and infected males, denoted as ms, mi, is:
dms=dt¼ 1 � afi
ð
ÞBm � Hmms � mmms
ð2:aÞ
dmi=dt¼afiBm þ Hmms � dmmi
ð2:bÞ
while the change in the fraction of susceptible and infected females, fs, fi, is:
dfs=dt¼ 1 � afi
ð
ÞBf � Hf fs � mf fs
ð3:aÞ
dfi=dt¼afiBf þ Hf fs � df fi
ð3:bÞ
where Bm and Bf are the average birth rates of males per male (the total male birth
rate divided by the number of males) and females per female and
Hm¼b dm
ð
Þgfmfi þ b df
�
�
gmmmi and Hf ¼b df
�
�
gff fi þ b dm
ð
Þgmf mi are the forces of
infection on the male and female populations respectively. The fractions of
recovered males and females, mr, fr can be obtained from ms þ mi þ mr ¼ 1 and
fs þ fi þ fr ¼ 1 respectively (see Supplementary Methods; Supplementary Table 1 for
a list of parameters and variables used).
Fitness. Next, consider the fate of a rare novel pathogen strain (which we will refer
to as the mutant) entering a population with an established pathogen (which we
will refer as the wild type) at equilibrium, with equilibrium values ^
ms and ^
mi and
females, ^
fs and ^
fi. At equilibrium the number of births equals the number of deaths
(both natural and caused by the disease) so that the total number of individuals in
the population remains constant and we have the equilibrium birth rates
^
Bm¼mm þ n dm
ð
Þ^
mi and Bf ¼mf þ nðdf Þ^
fi.
The mutant differs from the wild type in the parameters that govern host
exploitation,: d�

The fitness, W, of the mutant pathogen in a population dominated by the wild type
is the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix K*V* � 1 (refs 62,63),
which makes W a function of the traits of mutant and wild type pathogens. The
ESS is the exploitation strategy that maximizes the fitness of the mutant when the
mutant plays the wild type’s strategy. Therefore at the ESS the selection gradient of
the mutant pathogen is equal to zero64.
ESS calculation. To calculate the selection gradient we need the right and left
eigenvectors of the matrix A*, associated with eigenvalue 0, when the mutant’s
strategy is the same as the wild type strategy (see Supplementary Methods for a
more detailed derivation). The right eigenvector is w¼ð^

eigenvector is vT¼ð^
Tf =^

as the fraction of time the infection spends in males. Using this methodology we
were able to find the ESS strategy in general.
We next calculate the ESS strategy in three specific cases: (1) when the mutant
strategy has an effect on males only (male-specific), (2) when the mutant strategy
has an effect on females only (female-specific) and (3) when the mutant strategy
has the same effect in males and females (not sex-specific). We do this under the
assumption that there are no inherent physiological differences between the sexes
and that the trade offs work the same in both sexes, that is mf ¼ mm ¼ m,
