Abstract
Introduction
The US Surgeon General has concluded that e-cigarette aerosol is
not harmless and can contain harmful and potentially harmful
chemicals, including nicotine. We assessed factors associated with
adults’ perceptions of harm related to children’s exposure to
secondhand aerosol from electronic vapor products (EVPs).
Methods
Data came from the 2015 Styles, an Internet panel survey of US
adults aged 18 years or older (n = 4,127). Respondents were asked
whether they believe aerosol from other people’s EVPs causes
children harm. Harm perceptions were assessed overall and by ci-
garette smoking, EVP use, and sociodemographic characteristics.
Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess odds of per-
ceived harm.
Results
Overall, 5.3% of adults responded that secondhand EVP exposure
caused “no harm” to children, 39.9% responded “little harm” or
“some harm,” 21.5% responded “a lot of harm,” and 33.3% re-
sponded “don’t know.” Odds of “no harm” response were greater
among men than among women, current and former cigarette
smokers than among never smokers, and current and former EVP
users than among never users; odds were lower among non-His-
panic blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic other races than among
non-Hispanic whites. Odds of responding “don’t know” were
greater among men, current cigarette smokers, and current and
former EVP users; odds were lower among those aged 45 to 64
years than those aged 18 to 24 years and lower among non-His-
panic other races and Hispanics than non-Hispanic whites.
Conclusion
Two-fifths of US adults believe that children’s exposure to
secondhand EVP aerosol causes some or little harm, while one-
third do not know whether it causes harm. Efforts are warranted to
educate the public about the health risks of secondhand EVP aero-
sol, particularly for children.
Introduction
Electronic vapor products (EVPs), also called electronic nicotine
delivery systems, are devices designed to deliver nicotine and oth-
er additives to the user in the form of an aerosol, which is then ex-
haled by the user into the environment. Depending on the brand,
EVP cartridges typically contain nicotine, a component to pro-
duce the aerosol (eg, propylene glycol or glycerol), and flavorings
(eg, fruit, mint, chocolate). There are multiple types of EVPs on
the US market, including e-cigarettes, e-hookahs, hookah pens,
vape pens, and e-cigars; some of these products are disposable,
while others can be refilled or recharged for repeated use. Some
EVP marketing claims that they emit “harmless water vapor” (1,2)
However, scientific evidence indicates that the aerosol emitted by
EVPs may expose nonusers, including children and infants, to aer-
osolized nicotine and other potentially harmful substances, includ-
ing heavy metals, ultrafine particulates, and volatile organic com-
pounds; thus, this aerosol is not as safe as clean air (3). The US
Surgeon General has concluded that e-cigarette aerosol is not
harmless and that it can contain harmful and potentially harmful
chemicals, including nicotine (4). Animal and human studies
found that fetal and adolescent nicotine exposure can result in ad-
verse health effects, including impaired brain and lung develop-

 ment (4,5). Nicotine exposure during pregnancy could result in
low birthweight, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and sudden infant
death syndrome (4).
Children and infants can be exposed to nicotine from secondhand
EVP aerosol in numerous ways. Components of exhaled EVP aer-
osol are released into the atmosphere where it can be inhaled by
others (2). These components can also settle on surfaces, where
they can be ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin by
children and infants (2,3). Children and infants can be exposed to
secondhand aerosol in numerous places, including private settings
such as homes and vehicles as well as public places such as res-
taurants (5). Infants and children may be especially vulnerable to
the possible harmful effects of substances in EVP aerosol in lower
concentrations because of their smaller body weight and develop-
ing respiratory systems (3,5). Nicotine is toxic to infants and chil-
dren if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through skin. Additionally,
nicotine exposure during periods of developmental vulnerability,
from fetal through adolescent stages, can have multiple adverse
health effects, including impaired brain and lung development (6).
Some studies indicate that young people and adults perceive EVPs
as a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, and some e-cigar-
ette users perceive these products as a substitute for conventional
cigarettes in places where smoking is not allowed (7–9). A 2014
analysis found that 88% of e-cigarette websites noted that they can
be used anywhere, with 71% talking about the circumvention of
public smoke-free laws (1). The potential for involuntary second-
hand exposure to EVP aerosol among nonusers, children and
adults alike, in public indoor environments is of increasing con-
cern given that use of EVPs has increased considerably among US
youths and adults in recent years (10,11).
One study of adults’ perceptions of harm from secondhand EVP
aerosol was conducted in Spain during 2013 through 2014; it
found that nearly 70% of those surveyed believed that aerosol
from EVP exposure was not harmful to nonusers in general (12).
However, to our knowledge, no national study has examined per-
ceived harm from secondhand EVP exposure in the United States
among either adults or children. Because of the higher potential
vulnerability of children to secondhand EVP exposure and the im-
portance of determining population groups that will benefit most
from public health messaging and interventions to reduce second-
hand EVP exposure, we assessed perceptions of harm related to
children’s exposure to EVP aerosol among a nationally represent-
ative sample of US adults.
 
 
Methods
Data source
Data came from 2015 Styles, a series of seasonal national con-
sumer surveys developed and fielded by Porter Novelli. Styles
draws from KnowledgePanel, an Internet panel recruited by using
address-based probability sampling to reach respondents regard-
less of landline telephone or Internet access (10). If needed, house-
holds are provided with a laptop computer and Internet access.
Styles is conducted among a nationally representative sample of
US adults aged 18 years or older. In 2015, a total of 4,127 parti-
cipants  completed  Styles,  a  67%  response  rate.  Data  were
weighted to the US Census Current Population Survey distribu-
tions by using 9 factors: sex, age, annual household income, race/
ethnicity, household size, education level, US Census region,
whether the respondent resided in a metropolitan statistical area,
and whether the respondent had Internet access before the start of
the survey (13). Data were de-identified for analysis, and the study
was determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion’s Institutional Review Board to be exempt from human sub-
jects review.
Measures
Adults’ harm perceptions related to children’s exposure to second-
hand aerosol were assessed by the question “Do you believe that
when children breathe the aerosol from other people’s electronic
vapor products that it causes . . . ?” Reponses options were “no
harm,” “little harm,” “some harm,” “a lot of harm,” and “don’t
know.” This measure was developed using established measures
of tobacco-related harm perceptions, in consultation with subject
matter experts, and subsequently cognitively tested to ensure
validity.
Current cigarette smokers were respondents who reported smoking
at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and who smoked cigar-
ettes every day or some days at the time of the survey. Former
smokers were respondents who reported having smoked at least
100 cigarettes in their lifetime and who smoked not at all at the
time of survey. Never cigarette smokers were respondents who re-
ported not having smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.
Current EVP users were respondents who reported using any of
the following EVPs in their lifetime and within the previous 30
days: “electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), such as Blu, 21st Cen-
tury Smoke, or NJOY”; “electronic hookahs (e-hookahs), hookah
pens, or vape pens, such as Starbuzz or Fantasia”; or “some other
electronic vapor product such as electronic cigars (e-cigars) or
electronic pipes (e-pipes).” Former EVP users were respondents
who reported using EVPs at least once in their lifetime and who

 reported not using EVPs in the previous 30 days. Never EVP users
were respondents who reported not using EVPs in their lifetime
and not using EVPs in the previous 30 days. Four (<1%) respond-
ents were excluded from the analyses because they answered that
they had never used EVPs in their lifetime but had used EVPs in
the previous 30 days.
Assessed sociodemographic variables were sex, age, race/ethni-
city, educational attainment, annual household income, marital
status, US Census region, and whether at least 1 child younger
than 18 years lived in the respondent’s household.
Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated to assess the distribution of
harm perceptions by cigarette smoking, EVP use, and sociodemo-
graphic characteristics. We used χ2 tests to assess significant dif-
ferences between groups (P < .05). Adjusted multinomial logistic
regression was conducted to determine the odds of “no harm,”
“little harm” or “some harm,” and “don’t know” responses com-
pared with “a lot of harm” response. The adjusted model included
all of the aforementioned cigarette smoking, EVP use, and so-
ciodemographic characteristics. Analyses were conducted by us-
ing SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc), and data were weighted
to adjust for selection and nonresponse.
Results
A total of 4,127 adults completed the survey. The sociodemo-
graphic distribution of respondents was as follows: women, 52%;
aged 45 to 64 years, 35%; non-Hispanic white, 66%; high school
graduates, 30%; annual household income of $50,000 to $99,999,
35%; married, 60%; live in the South, 37%; and no children
younger than 18 years living in the household, 72%. Approxim-
ately 14% were current cigarette smokers and 5% were current
EVP users.
Overall, 5.3% responded that children’s exposure to secondhand
aerosol from EVPs caused “no harm,” 39.9% responded “little
harm” or “some harm,” 21.5% responded “a lot of harm,” and
33.3% responded “don’t know” (Table 1). Significant variation in
harm perceptions were observed by sex, age, race/ethnicity, educa-
tional attainment, annual household income, US Census region, ci-
garette smoking status, and EVP use (P < .05).
Following adjustment, the odds of perceiving “no harm” from
secondhand EVP aerosol exposure were greater among men than
women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.7–3.9) (Table 2). The odds of perceiving “no harm” were
lower among non-Hispanic blacks (AOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.7),
Hispanics (AOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.9), and non-Hispanic other
race (AOR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.8) than among non-Hispanic
whites. The odds of perceiving “no harm” were greater among
current (AOR, 4.1; 95% CI, 2.1–7.8) and former (AOR, 1.9; 95%
CI, 1.2–2.8) cigarette smokers compared with never smokers. In
addition, compared with never EVP users, the odds of perceiving
“no harm” were greater among current (AOR, 17.9; 95% CI,
8.0–39.9), and former (AOR, 7.5; 95% CI, 3.9–14.2) EVP users.
The odds of perceiving “little harm” or “some harm” were greater
among men than women (AOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4–2.1), and lower
among adults aged 65 years or older (AOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4–0.9)
compared with adults aged 18 to 24 years, as well as among His-
panics (AOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4–0.8) and non-Hispanic other race
(AOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4–0.8) compared with non-Hispanic whites.
The odds of perceiving “little harm” or “some harm” were greater
among current smokers (AOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.8) compared
with never smokers, and among current (AOR, 2.3; 95% CI,
1.1–4.9) and former (AOR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7–4.5) EVP users com-
pared with never EVP users.
The odds of reporting “don’t know” were greater among men than
women (AOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7), and adults aged 45 to 64
years compared with adults aged 18 to 24 years (AOR, 1.6; 95%
CI, 1.1–2.4). In contrast, the odds of reporting “don’t know” were
lower among non-Hispanic blacks (AOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4–0.9),
Hispanics (AOR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7), and non-Hispanic races
other than white or black (AOR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2–0.5) compared
with non-Hispanic whites, as well as among adults living in the
West (AOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4–0.9) compared with those in the
Northeast. The odds of reporting “don’t know” were greater
among current smokers (AOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4–3.5) than among
never smokers and among current (AOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1–4.7)
and former (AOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0) EVP users compared
with never EVP users.
Discussion
Our findings reveal that 22% of US adults believe that exposure to
secondhand EVP aerosol causes a lot of harm to children, 40% be-
lieve it causes little or some harm, 5% believe it causes no harm,
and an additional one-third of adults reported not knowing wheth-
er secondhand EVP aerosol exposure causes harm to children.
Current cigarette smokers and EVP users had greater odds of re-
porting that exposure to secondhand EVP aerosol causes “no
harm” or “little harm” or “some harm” to children compared with
never cigarette smokers and never EVP users. However, scientific
evidence indicates that EVP aerosol exhaled into the air poten-
tially exposes nonusers to aerosolized nicotine and other harmful
and potentially harmful substances, including heavy metals, ul-
trafine particulates, and volatile organic compounds (1–5). Nicot-
ine exposure during periods of developmental vulnerability, from

 fetal through adolescent stages, may have multiple adverse health
effects, including impaired brain and lung development (2–6). The
fact that many adults did not know whether there are harms associ-
ated with children’s exposure to EVP aerosol, and some incor-
rectly believed there were no harms, underscores the importance
of educating the public on the health risks of secondhand EVP aer-
osol exposure for nonusers, particularly children (4).
Variations in perceived harm were observed across sociodemo-
graphic groups, even after adjusting for current cigarette smoking
and EVP use. More specifically, the odds of responding “no
harm,” “little harm” or “some harm,” or “don’t know” was
greatest among men and non-Hispanic whites. These variations in
harm perceptions may be the result of multiple factors, including
use of other forms of tobacco use among these individuals, mar-
keting messages that downplay the potential health risks of EVP
use or exposure to EVP aerosol, or factors related to social disap-
proval of smoking or EVP use (4,14). These sociodemographic
differences suggest that public health education may be warranted
to inform the public about the potential health risks of exposure to
EVP aerosol, especially for children.
The 2016 Surgeon General’s Report on e-cigarette use among
youth and young adults concluded that e-cigarette aerosol is not
harmless and stated, “Smokefree indoor air policies should be up-
dated to prohibit the use of both conventional cigarettes and e-ci-
garettes, thereby preserving standard for clean indoor air” (4). As
of December 2016, eight states (California, Delaware, Hawaii,
Maine, North Dakota, New Jersey, Oregon, and Utah) and 507
localities have enacted comprehensive smoke-free laws that pro-
hibit conventional smoking and EVP use in all indoor areas of
work sites, restaurants, and bars (15). However, most of the US
population is not protected by laws that specifically prohibit EVP
use (16). Momentum to protect nonusers, particularly children,
from exposure to secondhand aerosol in public areas may be im-
peded by lack of knowledge about the potential harms of second-
hand EVP aerosol as well EVP advertising messages. Some EVP
marketing includes unproven claims of safety as well as state-
ments that the products are exempt from smoke-free policies,
which may not be true in all states (1). These messages could un-
dermine clean indoor air standards by encouraging people to use
EVPs as substitutes for conventional smoking in areas where con-
ventional smoking is prohibited. Clean indoor air standards pro-
tect from exposure to secondhand smoke and aerosol and have
been shown to help reduce initiation of smoking and use of to-
bacco among young people by denormalizing tobacco use. (17). In
addition, because some e-cigarettes (eg, cigalikes) are designed to
mimic smoking, allowing EVP use in places where smoking is
prohibited could complicate enforcement of smoke-free policies
(15). In addition to public places, private settings such as homes
and vehicles are locations where children may also be exposed to
secondhand EVP aerosol. Across the United States, 18.9% of
adults do not have voluntary smoke-free home rules and 26.4% do
not have smoke-free vehicle rules (18). By establishing 100%
smoke-free home and vehicle rules that also include EVPs, par-
ents and caregivers can protect the health of their children and
help prevent exposure to secondhand EVP aerosol among chil-
dren in their care.
In addition to prohibiting EVP use in indoor areas, other popula-
tion-based public health interventions are warranted to protect the
public, particularly children, from possible harmful effects of
secondhand EVP aerosol exposure. Strategies could include in-
forming the public about the potential harmful effects of second-
hand EVP aerosol (15). Promoting tobacco-free norms, fully en-
forcing smoke-free laws that include EVP use, and educating the
public about the harms related to secondhand EVP exposure for
children could reduce the risk of exposure in children (15). When
addressing potential public health harms associated with EVP use
and secondhand exposure to EVP aerosol, it is important to imple-
ment the strategies promoted by the US Surgeon General to pre-
vent and reduce the use of all forms of tobacco, including tobacco
price increases, comprehensive smoke-free laws that include
EVPs, high-impact antitobacco media campaigns, barrier-free ces-
sation treatment and services, and comprehensive statewide to-
bacco control programs (18). Using a comprehensive approach, as
well as educating the public on the dangers of nicotine exposure
among children and adolescents, could reduce secondhand EVP
exposure among nonusers and the misperception that EVP aerosol
is harmless.
The findings of this study are subject to some limitations. First, re-
spondents were recruited from a list of web panelists, which may
limit generalizability. However, Styles data were weighted to be
nationally representative of the US adult population, and tobacco
use estimates from Styles are consistent with other national house-
hold surveys of US adults (19). Second, because of the questions
available on the Styles survey, former EVP use was ascertained
using ever use as a threshold for regular use. Given that it was not
possible to distinguish between former EVP users who routinely
used the products and those who only briefly experimented with
the products, this classification could introduce bias. Third, limita-
tions related to questionnaire content and variations in question
comparability prevented the assessment of harm perceptions by
other tobacco product use, cigarette smoking behaviors (eg, quit
attempts), and type of EVP use (eg, disposable, mid-sized, tank
system). We attempted to study dual use; however, because the
number of respondents that reported being current cigarette
smokers and current EVP users in our sample was low (113
[2.9%] using weighted data), it was not possible to assess this

 measure in more nuance because of unstable estimates and large
relative standard errors. Fourth, self-reporting of smoking status
and EVP use could lead to misclassification bias; the validity of
self-reported smoking is well-established (20), but the validity of
self-reported EVP use is uncertain. Finally, because the EVP
product landscape is rapidly changing, EVP use may be underes-
timated if EVP users referred to the products they used with ter-
minology other than what was provided in the questionnaire.
However, multiple EVP product examples and terminologies were
included in the question to minimize the potential for misclassific-
ation bias.
In conclusion, current and former cigarette smokers and EVP
users had greater odds than nonusers of perceiving no harm to-
ward children exposed to EVP aerosol. Variations in harm percep-
tions were also observed across sexes and race/ethnicities. EVP
use potentially exposes nonusers, including children, to aerosol-
ized nicotine and other harmful substances (1–6). Therefore, clean
air — free of both smoke and EVP aerosol — remains the stand-
ard to protect health. In coordination with a comprehensive ap-
proach to prevent and reduce secondhand smoke exposure and to-
bacco use by young people, efforts are warranted to educate the
public, particularly current and former cigarette smokers and EVP
users, about the potential health risks of secondhand EVP aerosol
exposure among children.

a Data came from 2015 Styles, a series of seasonal national consumer surveys developed and fielded by Porter Novelli. Styles draws from KnowledgePanel, an In-
ternet panel recruited by using address-based probability sampling to reach respondents regardless of landline telephone or Internet access (10). If needed, house-
holds are provided with a laptop computer and Internet access. Styles is conducted among a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 18 years or older.
