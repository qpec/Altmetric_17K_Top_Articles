Abstract
Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk of childhood diseases by disrupting 
hormonally mediated processes critical for growth and development during gestation, infancy, or 
childhood. The fetus, infant, and child may have enhanced sensitivity to environmental stressors 
like EDCs due to rapid development and greater exposure to some EDCs that results from their 
developmentally appropriate behavior, anatomy, and physiology. This review summarizes 
epidemiological studies examining the relations of early-life exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), 
phthalates, triclosan, and perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) with childhood neurobehavioral 
disorders and obesity. The available epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to 
several of these ubiquitous EDCs is associated with adverse neurobehavior (BPA and phthalates) 
and excess adiposity or increased risk of obesity/overweight (PFAS). Quantifying the effects of 
EDC mixtures, improving EDC exposure assessment, reducing bias from confounding, identifying 
periods of heightened vulnerability, and elucidating the presence and nature of sexually dimorphic 
EDC effects would result in stronger inferences from epidemiological studies. Ultimately, better 
estimates of the causal effects of EDC exposures on child health could help identify susceptible 
sub-populations and lead to public health interventions to reduce these exposures.
Introduction
Accumulating research shows that environmental stressors during gestation, infancy, and 
early childhood are risk factors for diseases in childhood and adulthood.1,2 These studies 
demonstrate that perturbation of sensitive biological processes during distinct periods of 
development can increase the risk of adverse health outcomes years or decades after 
exposure to the stressor. For example, exposure to environmental chemicals, 
pharmaceuticals, tobacco smoke, alcohol, and stress increase the risk of obesity, type 2 
diabetes, reproductive disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders/deficits, and cancer.3–9 Well-
established examples include the increased risk of vaginal clear cell carcinoma following 
prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure; cognitive decrements among children with prenatal or 
childhood exposure to lead or mercury; and childhood obesity among offspring born to 
smokers, despite lower birth weight.3–5,10

 Environmental chemical exposures are one stressor that may adversely affect normal human 
development. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a class of chemicals that could 
increase the risk of disease across the lifespan by altering the homeostasis or action of 
endogenous hormones or other signalling chemicals of the endocrine system.11 EDCs may 
increase the risk of disease by altering the production, release, transport, metabolism, 
binding, action, or elimination of endogenous hormones that program or maintain normal 
growth and development (Figure 1). There is particular concern that the fetus, infant, or 
child may have higher exposure to some EDCs or be more vulnerable compared to adults.
The fetus, infant, and child may have higher exposure to some EDCs than adults. because of 
developmentally appropriate differences in diet, behavior, physiology, anatomy, and 
toxicokinetics.12 For instance, infants and children may have higher exposure to some EDCs 
than adults because they consume more water and greater quantities of specific foods, and 
have higher ventilation rates, intestinal absorption, surface area to volume ratios, and hand-
to-mouth activity.13 In addition, breastfed infants may have higher serum concentrations of 
some peristent EDCs than their mothers becaues of lactational exposure.14
In addition to higher exposure to some EDCs, the fetus, infant, and child may be more 
sensitive to the effects of EDCs than adults for two reasons. First, differences in 
toxicokinetics can result in higher circulating or tissue concentrations of an EDC for a given 
dose. For example, compared to adults, the fetus has lower levels of several cytochrome 
P450 enzymes that metabolize environmental chemicals and pharmaceuticals.15,16 Second, 
there are many time-dependent and synchronized processes that are programmed during 
early development that could increase the risk of childhood disease if perturbed. For 
instance, disruption of neurulation, neuronal differentiation/proliferation/migration, 
gliogenesis, synaptogenesis, dendritic growth, myelination, apoptosis, synaptic pruning, or 
neurotransmitter systems could increase the risk of behavioral disorders or cognitive 
deficits.17,18 In addition, epigenetic mechanisms, some of which are hormonally regulated, 
may mediate some of the effects of early life EDCs exposures on long term health 
outcomes.19 Thus, there is concern that early life exposure to EDCs may increase the risk of 
childhood diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and obesity. 20,21
EDCs may increase the risk of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders by interfering with 
early life thyroid hormone signaling or metabolism. Thyroid hormones play a critical role in 
neuronal migration, synaptogenesis, and myelination during gestation and childhood.22 Even 
clinically non-significant variations in maternal thyroxine or thyroid stimultaing hormone 
(TSH) levels during pregnancy are associated with reduced cognitive abilities, 23 attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms,24 and increased autism risk.23–26 Studies 
show that the timing of thyroid hormone availability influences the neurobehavioral 
phenotype. Gestational thyroxine reductions are associated with deficits in visual processing, 
visuomotor abilities, and motor skills, while postnatal reductions are associated with deficits 
in language, fine motor skills, attention, and memory.27–30 That both pre- and postnatal 
thyroid hormones are necessary for different aspects of neurodevelopment illustrates the 
potential time-dependent sensitivity of the developing brain to thyroid hormone disruptions.

 Early life EDC exposures may perturb neuroendocrine systems involved in growth, energy 
metabolism, appetite, adipogenesis, and glucose-insulin homeostasis to promote childhood 
obesity, cardiometabolic dysfunction, and liver dysfunction.31–34 These perturbations may 
lead to a ‘thrifty phenotype’ that promotes more efficient energy storage, rapid early life 
weight gain, and excess adipose mass.35–41 Rapid growth and excess adiposity lead to 
increased circulating levels of free fatty acids, in turn causing a cascade of metabolic 
changes that reduce the capacity for liver and muscle to absorb, store, and metabolize 
glucose,42–44 which in turn casues increased pancreatic insulin secretion and resistance. In 
the setting of insulin resistance, excess adipose tissue lipolysis contributes to increased 
delivery of free fatty acids to the liver, de novo hepatic lipogenesis, accumulation of 
triglycerides in the liver vacuoles, and hepatic steatosis (i.e., non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease).45
Despite their seemingly unrelated nature, shared neuroendocrine pathways could be 
disrupted by EDC exposures to influence the risk of both childhood obesity and 
neurodevelopment disorders (Figure 1).46–48 Indeed, the prevalence of excess adiposity is 
higher among children with behavioral disorders, like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD), and obese children have lower academic achievement, impaired attention and 
working memory, and reduced cortical thickness and white matter integrity compared to lean 
children.49–51 Moreover, up to 30% of the genes associated with adiposity are the same as 
those associated with processing speed.52 Finally, increased impulsivity, a key feature of 
ADHD, is related to food responsivity in adolescents53 and administration of the 
adipocytokine ghrelin to rodents increases impulsive behaviors.54
There is concern over the health effects of EDC mixtures.55 Despite biomonitoring studies 
documenting that humans are exposed to dozens of potential EDCs across the lifespan and 
that some EDC exposures are correlated with each other,56,57 most epidemiological studies 
have examined the health effects of EDCs as if they occur in isolation from one another. 
Without accounting for EDC mixtures, the available literature may fail to quanitfy the 
synergistic or cumulative healht effects of EDCs, as well as confounding due to correlated 
co-pollutants.
Given the above, this narrative review has three objectives. First, this review will discuss 
epidemiological studies examining associations between early-life exposure to several EDCs 
and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders and obesity. It will focus on select EDCs for 
which there is widespread general population exposure, specifically phthalates, bisphenol A 
(BPA), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and triclosan (Table 1). There are other excellent 
reviews for readers interested in chemicals with declining exposure that have been banned or 
phased out of production (e.g., organochlorine compounds).58 As a second objective, this 
review will describe some limitations to making stronger inferences from epidemiological 
studies about the impact of EDC exposures on child health and propose how researchers 
might address these limitations through better study designs and methods. Finally, this 
review closes with some guidance for clinicians to address patients’ concerns about EDC 
exposure reduction.

 Phthalates
Phthalate Uses, Exposure, and Measurement
Phthalates are a class of EDCs used in a multitude of consumer products, including personal 
care products, medications, and plastics (Table 1). Biomonitoring studies from around the 
world indicate that there is universal phthalate exposure among pregnant women, infants, 
and children.59–72 Phthalate exposure occurs through ingestion, inhalation, or dermal 
absorption.73–76 Additionally, phthalates can cross the placenta, resulting in exposure to the 
fetus.77
After entering the body, phthalates are rapidly hydrolyzed to their respective monoester 
metabolites (Table 1).78 Low molecular weight phthalates (di-ethyl phthalate [DEP], di-n-
butyl phthalate, and di-iso-butyl phthalate) are excreted in the urine as glucuronide or sulfate 
conjugated hydrolytic monoesters, while mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, the hydrolytic 
metabolite of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), undergoes additional enzymatic oxidation 
before being conjugated and excreted. Although phthalates do not persist in the body and 
have short biological half-lives (<24 hours), there is repeated, episodic, and long-term 
exposure. Phthalate exposure is assessed using urine biospecimens since phthalates are 
predominately excreted in the urine and blood levels, which are considerably lower, may be 
subject to exogenous contamination during sample collection, storage, or processing.79
Misclassification of phthalate exposure is a concern in epidemiological studies due to their 
short biological half-lives and the episodic nature of phthalate exposures from diet (e.g., 
DEHP) or personal care products (e.g., DEP). To address this concern, accurate phthalate 
exposure assessment necessitates the collection and analysis of multiple urine samples.80
Biological Mechanisms of Phthalate Action
Phthalates may interfere with the action or metabolism of androgens, thyroid hormones, and 
glucocorticoids. Some phthalates are anti-androgenic and reduce testicular testosterone 
production by decreasing the expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis and steroid 
trafficking.81,82 Animal and human studies show that some phthalates may reduce thyroxine 
and triiodothyronine concentration in pregnant women and children,83–85 antagonize T3 
binding to thyroid receptor-β,86 reduce cellular T3 uptake,87 and affect transcription of the 
sodium-iodine transporter.88 Phthalates can also inhibit 11-β-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase-2, which deactivates cortisol.89 In addition, phthalate exposure may affect 
offspring health by causing oxidative stress90 or via epigenetic re-programming of the fetus 
and placenta.91
There is concern about the health effects of phthalate mixtures since humans are exposed to 
multiple phthalates at once and rodent studies demonstrate that phthalates have 
concentration additive effects on fetal androgen production.82,92 Thus, the aggregate of 
individual phthalate exposures may have an additive impact on human health since 
individual phthalates share a common mechanism of action.

 Phthalates and Neurodevelopment
Six publications from four prospective cohort studies report that prenatal exposure to several 
different phthalates is associated with ADHD behaviors,59,60,93,94 autistic behaviors,61 
reduced mental and psychomotor development,60,62 emotional problems,60 and reduced 
IQ.63 In a prospective cohort of 328 mothers, the reductions in child IQ associated with 
increasing maternal urinary phthalate concentrations were as large as or larger than the 
cognitive decrements observed with childhood lead exposure (5th vs. 1st quintile: 7-points; 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 2, 11).3,63 It is important to note that three other publications 
did not find associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and child neurobehavior.64–66
Three publications report that childhood exposure to some phthalates is associated with 
reduced cognitive abilities65 and behavioral problems.67,68 However, these studies were 
cross-sectional and reverse causality may explain these findings.
In summary, the epidemiological literature to date suggests that prenatal phthalate exposure 
may be associated with behavioral problems and cognitive decrements in children. 
Inconsistencies across studies may be due to differences in the timing of when phthalate 
exposure was assessed (e.g., early vs. late gestation), misclassification of phthalate exposure 
from studies using a single urine sample to assess exposure, or differences in child age at 
neurodevelopment assessment.
Phthalates and Adiposity/Obesity
Three publications from prospective cohorts examined prenatal phthalate exposure and 
childhood adiposity.70–72 One publication reported that prenatal DEHP exposure is 
associated with decreased body mass index (BMI) in boys and increased BMI in girls,70 
whereas another publication found that non-DEHP phthalate exposures were associated with 
decreased BMI in boys, but not girls.71 A third publication did not report any association 
between prenatal phthalate exposure and childhood adiposity.72 In a pooled cohort including 
US participants from two of the previously mentioned cohort studies, increasing maternal 
urinary mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate concentrations during pregnancy were associated 
with a doubling in the risk of being overweight or obese (95% CI: 1.2, 4.0).95
Four publications have examined childhood phthalate exposure and adiposity.71,96–98 Three 
of these reported that childhood exposure to DEP was associated with excess adiposity and 
increased prevalence of obesity or excess adiposity,98 but another did not.71 In a prospective 
cohort of over 1,000 US girls, higher DEP exposure at 6–8 years of age was associated with 
increased BMI scores and waist circumference at 7–13 years of age.97 In a cross-sectional 
study of US children, increasing urine concentrations of low molecular weight phthalates 
was associated with a 22% increase in the prevalence of obesity.99
In summary, the associations between early-life phthalate exposure and child adiposity or 
obesity risk have been inconsistent and do not support the hypothesis that phthalates are 
chemical obesogens. The one exception to this was the association between childhood DEP 
exposure and child adiposity or obesity prevalence. However, this association may be due to 
children with higher adiposity also having greater surface area, leading to the application of

 greater amounts of phthalate-containing personal care products to their skin, which in turn 
results in higher urinary MEP concentrations.99
BPA
BPA Uses, Exposure, and Measurement
BPA is used to produce polycarbonate plastics and resins that are used in a wide range of 
consumer products (Table 1). Oral ingestion is the predominant exposure route since BPA 
can leach into food and beverage containers; however, dermal absorption and inhalation may 
be additional routes of exposure among persons working with BPA-containing 
receipts.100–102 BPA is excreted in the urine as glucuronide/sulfate conjugates, does not 
persist in the body, and has an estimated biological half-life of ~6 hours.103 BPA exposure is 
assessed by measuring urine concentrations of free and conjugated BPA. Urine is used since 
BPA is almost exclusively excreted in the urine, and blood levels are considerably lower and 
subject to exogenous contamination.79 Biomonitoring studies around the world indicate 
nearly universal BPA exposure among pregnant women, infants, and children.56,64,104–120 
Much like some phthalates, urinary BPA concentrations have considerable within-person 
variation due to diet being the predominant source of exposure. Thus, it is essential to collect 
multiple urine samples to ensure accurate exposure assessment.
Biological Mechanisms of BPA Action
BPA may interact with a variety of hormonal systems that affect growth, metabolism, and 
neurodevelopment. Dodds and Lawson recognized BPA as a weak estrogen in 1936.121 BPA 
is a weak agonist of the nuclear estrogen receptors α and β compared to estradiol.122 
However, BPA may also act on plasma protein bound estrogen receptors allowing BPA to 
interfere with estrogenic signaling at nanomolar and picomolar levels.123,124 In vitro studies 
show that BPA may affect androgen/estrogen concentrations by inhibiting key enzymes 
involved in gonadal hormone synthesis and metabolism,125 but results from human studies 
are not consistent.126–128 Rodent studies have found that prenatal BPA exposure is 
associated with higher T4 levels in offspring129 and thyroid-specific gene expression.130 
Some epidemiological studies show that BPA exposure is associated with altered maternal, 
neonatal, or adolescent thyroid parameters.131–133
BPA and Neurodevelopment
In 2008, the National Toxicology Program concluded that there was “some concern” over 
the effect of BPA on neurobehavioral endpoints based on findings in animal studies.134 
Since then, there have been eight studies from five prospective cohorts examining prenatal 
BPA exposure and child neurobehavior.64,110–116 Four publications from three of these 
prospective cohorts reported that prenatal BPA exposure was associated with more 
internalizing behaviors in children, with stronger associations in boys than girls.110,113–115 
Two publications from another cohort reported that prenatal BPA exposure was associated 
with more internalizing and externalizing behaviors in girls, but not boys.111,112 One 
publication reported that prenatal BPA concentrations were associated with increased risk of 
ADHD-related behaviors at 4 years of age, with stronger associations in boys.116 Two other 
publications have reported that prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were not associated

 with parent-reported reciprocal social behaviors.61,64 The association between prenatal BPA 
exposures and children’s cognitive abilities has not been thoroughly examined, with one 
study reporting that prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with parent-
reported executive function in 3-year old girls.112
Seven publications have examined the relation between childhood BPA exposures and 
behavior problems or ADHD-related behaviors.67,110,112–114,135,136 Generally, the results 
are inconsistent. Some report that childhood BPA exposures were associated with ADHD 
behaviors in boys,135 ADHD behaviors in both boys and girls,135 anxious/depressive/
aggressive behaviors in girls,110,113,114 or learning problems.137 Some publications report 
null associations between childhood BPA exposures and neurobehavior.67,112
In summary, these studies suggest that both prenatal and postnatal BPA exposure is 
associated with parent-reported behavior problems in children, but there are inconsistencies 
across these studies with regard to the period of life with the greatest vulnerability to 
exposure (prenatal vs. infancy vs. childhood) and sex-specific effects. The heterogeneity of 
these findings could be due to the substantial within-person variation of urinary BPA 
concentrations that results in BPA exposure misclassification.
BPA and Adiposity/Obesity
Seven publications from prospective cohort studies have examined whether early-life BPA 
exposure is obesogenic.104–107,117,118,138 Three publications report that higher prenatal BPA 
exposure was associated with lower BMI and that these associations were stronger in 
girls.104–106 Two other publications reported that prenatal BPA exposure was associated with 
increased waist circumference, BMI, and risk of being overweight or obese.107,117 Two 
other publications reported no association between prenatal BPA exposure and child 
adiposity measures.118,138
Some of the aforementioned studies have prospectively examined the relation between infant 
or childhood BPA exposure and subsequent adiposity,104–107 and several cross-sectional 
studies have been conducted.119,120 Among publications with prospective measures of BPA 
exposure during infancy or childhood, there is little evidence to suggest that BPA exposure is 
associated with excess adiposity.104–107 However, cross-sectional studies show that BPA 
exposure is positively correlated with adiposity or the prevalence of being overweight or 
obese.105,106,120 For instance, in a nationally representative sample of US children, children 
in the top 3 quartiles of urinary BPA concentrations were ~25% more likely to be 
overweight and >2-fold more likely to be obese compared to children in the lowest 
quartile.119 However, the strength of this association did not monotonically increase across 
quartiles of BPA exposure, suggesting a threshold effect or potential residual confounding. 
Still, other publications report no association between infant or childhood BPA exposure and 
childhood obesity.104,107
The available epidemiological literature is equivocal about the obesogenic effects of early-
life BPA exposure, with studies showing both increases and decreases in adiposity or risk of 
being overweight or obese with higher early-life BPA exposure. Cross-sectional associations 
between urinary BPA concentrations and childhood adiposity could be due to residual

 confounding from dietary factors that are associated with both BPA exposure and adiposity. 
In addition, reverse causality could be responsible for these correlations if persons with 
excess adiposity have different dietary patterns that increase their exposure to BPA.
Triclosan
Triclosan Uses, Exposure, and Measurement
Triclosan is an antimicrobial chemical that disrupts bacterial lipid synthesis and cell 
membrane integrity and is used in numerous consumer products (Table 1).139 Exposure is 
predominately through oral and dermal routes.139 Triclosan is not persistent, has a biological 
half-life <24 hours, and is predominately excreted in the urine as a glucuronide or sulfate 
conjugate.140 Triclosan exposure is measured using urine biospecimens for the same reasons 
BPA and phthalates are measured using urine biospecimens.79 Biomonitoring studies 
indicate nearly universal triclosan exposure among pregnant women and children.56,108,141 
While triclosan has a short biological half-life similar to that of BPA and some phthalates, 
unlike BPA and some phthalates, urinary triclosan concentrations are relatively stable over 
time within a person.
Biological Mechanisms of Triclosan Action
Triclosan can disrupt gonadal and thyroid hormone homeostasis. In rodents, triclosan 
reduces testosterone production by disrupting cholesterol biosynthesis in Leydig cells.142,143 
In a systematic review and meta-analysis of eight rodent studies, triclosan exposure reduced 
thyroxine concentrations in the fetus, dam, neonate, and juvenile.144 Triclosan may reduce 
thyroxine concentrations by activating nuclear receptors to increase hepatic catabolism of 
thyroxine.145 Results from epidemiological studies of triclosan and thyroid function are not 
consistent.146,147 However, there are no prospective epidemiological studies examining the 
relation between triclosan and thyroid hormone biomarkers during gestation, infancy, or 
childhood. Finally, given its antimicrobial activity, triclosan may be capable of altering the 
composition or function of the microbiota, but there is little research examining this 
hypothesis.148
Triclosan and Neurodevelopment
Currently, there are no animal or epidemiological studies directly examining the 
neurotoxicity of early-life triclosan exposure. As noted, triclosan exposure may reduce 
serum thyroxine concentrations during pregnancy and this could cause adverse 
neurodevelopment given the important role that thyroxine plays in fetal brain 
development.23 Three epidemiological studies report suggestive inverse associations 
between prenatal triclosan exposure and neonatal anthropometry.118,149,150 Thus, given that 
head circumference is positively correlated with later life IQ, early-life triclosan exposure 
could adversely impact neurodevelopment.151
Triclosan and Adiposity/Obesity
Four publications have reported on the relation between triclosan exposure and childhood 
obesity or excess adiposity.152,153 Two cross-sectional studies using 6–19 year old children 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey report conflicting results. One

 publication (years: 2007–2010), found no association between urinary triclosan 
concentrations and BMI z-score, waist circumference, or prevalence of being overweight or 
obese.154 In the second publication (years: 2003–2010), urinary triclosan concentrations 
were associated with a monotonic decrease BMI and waist circumference.153 Another 
publication a reported that urinary triclosan concentrations were similar in lean and 
overweight/obese children.155 In a prospective cohort study, prenatal triclosan exposure was 
not associated with child adiposity at 4 to 9 years of age.138
In summary, there is insufficient evidence to determine if early-life triclosan exposure is 
associated with childhood obesity. The inconsistent results between studies using the 
NHANES speaks to the importance of replication when examining the potential health 
effects of EDCs.
Perfluoroalkyl Substances
PFAS Uses, Exposure, and Measurement
PFAS are a class of man-made fluorinated chemicals used in stain/water resistant coatings 
for textiles, non-stick cookware, food container coatings, floor polish, fire-fighting foam, 
and industrial surfactants (Table 1).156 The strong C-F chemical bond makes PFAS 
extremely resistant to thermal, chemical, and biological degradation, which results in 
bioaccumulation and persistence in human tissues for years.157 Four perfluoroalkyl acids - 
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid 
(PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) - are almost universally detected in the 
serum of pregnant women, neonates, and children worldwide, indicating that exposure is 
ubiquitous and these chemicals can cross the placenta.56,64,158–176
Unlike phthalates, BPA, and triclosan, PFAS have long biological half-lives in humans, 
ranging from 3.8 to 7.3 years.177 Thus, a single serum or plasma concentration is sufficient 
to characterize exposure for epidemiological studies. The sources and relative contributions 
of different PFAS to human exposure vary according to age-related behavioral factors and 
dietary patterns, and PFAS exposures during infancy can equal or exceed prenatal exposures 
derived from the mother.156,178 For instance, breast milk and formula may contribute almost 
exclusively to infant’s exposure since PFAS are found in breast milk and water, and infants 
consume up to 6 times as much fluid as adults (150 vs. 26 ml/kg/day).179–181
Biological Mechanisms of PFAS Action
PFAS may act on a number of endocrine pathways to affect the risk of neurodevelopmental 
disorders and obesity. In epidemiological studies, PFOA and PFOS exposures are associated 
with lower global DNA cytosine methylation, higher Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 
methylation, and changes in the expression of genes involved in cholesterol 
metabolism.182–184 PFOA and PFOS can bind to and activate the peroxisome proliferator 
activated receptor (PPAR)-α/γ to increase adipocyte differentiation and increase body 
fat.185–187 In addition, PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS inhibit 11-β-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase-2 to increase glucocorticoid concentrations in rodents, which might affect

 growth and brain development.89 Animal studies show that PFAS are capable of inducing 
changes in thyroid function,188 but results from human studies are not consistent.189
PFAS and Neurodevelopment
Eleven publications from prospective cohorts have examined the relations between prenatal 
PFAS exposure and cognitive abilities,165,166 attainment of developmental milestones,167 
parent or teacher reported behaviors and executive function,64,167–170 psychomotor 
development,169 academic achievement,171 or risk of autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, or 
cerebral palsy.172–174 With regard to the most commonly detected PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, 
PFNA, and PFHxS), these publications report inconsistent results. In a prospective birth 
cohort of 218 mother-child pairs, higher prenatal PFOS exposure was associated with worse 
parent-reported executive function.170 In another prospective birth cohort, increasing 
prenatal PFOS and PFOA exposures were associated with 70 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.8) and 110% 
(95% CI: 1.2, 3.6) increased risk of cerebral palsy, respectively.172 Several studies report 
protective or null associations between prenatal PFAS exposure and child 
neurobehavior.64,165–167,169,173
Four publications have examined the relations between childhood PFAS exposure and 
neurodevelopment.165,168,175,176 Two publications from cross-sectional studies report that 
children’s serum PFAS concentrations were associated with increased prevalence of parent-
reported ADHD or ADHD medication use.168,175 However, in a prospective cohort study 
with exceptionally high PFOA exposure, children’s serum PFOA concentrations were not 
consistently associated with parent- or teacher-reported ADHD-related behaviors or other 
neuropsychological measurements.165,172
The available body of evidence does not consistently suggest that early-life PFAS exposures 
are associated with neurodevelopment. While some studies suggest adverse neurobehavioral 
outcomes among children with elevated prenatal or childhood PFAS exposures, there are 
inconsistencies regarding which individual PFAS exposures may be associated with 
neurobehavior and whether there are heightened periods of vulnerability to PFAS exposures. 
The protective associations between early-life PFAS exposure and neurodevelopment is 
biologically plausible because in vitro studies report that PFOA and PFOS are agonists of 
PPAR-γ and activation of this receptor may be neuroprotective.190 Additional studies with 
longitudinal measures of exposure and comprehensive assessment of neurodevelopment are 
warranted given the ubiquity and persistence of PFAS exposure.
PFAS and Adiposity/Obesity
There is a compelling body of evidence suggesting that prenatal PFAS exposure could affect 
fetal growth and subsequent risk of childhood obesity. In a systematic review of 18 
publications, and subsequent meta-analysis of nine of these, increasing prenatal PFOA 
exposure was associated with a 19 gram decrease in birth weight (95% CI: −30, −8).158 
These results in humans are similar to those observed in 21 rodent studies where each 1 
mg/kg/d increase in PFOA exposure was associated with a 0.023 gram decrease in pup birth 
weight (95% CI: −0.029, −0.016).191 Altered fetal growth patterns related to PFAS exposure 
may increase the risk of subsequent obesity and cardiometabolic disorders as prior studies

 show that fetal growth deceleration and infancy growth acceleration are associated with 
increased adiposity and cardiometabolic risk markers in later childhood.39,192,193
Consistent with this hypothesis, five publications from prospective cohort studies report that 
prenatal PFAS exposure is associated with alterations in infant or child growth,160,163 
increased adiposity during childhood and adulthood,159–161 and higher waist-to-height 
ratio.162 Two publications from other prospective cohort studies, including one with 
exceptionally high PFOA exposure, did not observe an association between prenatal PFAS 
exposure and child or adult adiposity or risk of being overweight or obese.164,194 These two 
studies used self- or parent-reported anthropometry, which could be responsible for the null 
results since there are well-documented errors in self- and parent-reported anthropometry 
that could misclassify adiposity and attenuate associations towards the null.195,196
Two studies have examined childhood PFAS exposure and adiposity. In a cross-sectional 
study of US adolescents, PFOS exposure was associated with decreased BMI and waist 
circumference, while other PFAS were not associated with BMI or waist circumference.197 
In a prospective cohort study, PFOS exposure at 9 years of age (and to a less precise extent 
PFOA exposure) was associated with increased adiposity at 15 and 21 years of age.198
Challenges to Making Stronger Inferences about EDCs and Child Health
Chemical mixtures, exposure misclassification, confounding, periods of heightened 
vulnerability, and sexually dimorphic associations are challenges to making stronger 
inferences about the causal links between early-life EDC exposures and the risk of 
childhood diseases. I discuss below some tractable solutions that if incorporated into study 
design or statistical analysis, could improve our confidence in making causal inferences.
Chemical Mixtures
Exposure to a mixture of EDCs occurs across the lifespan, yet researchers primarily examine 
exposures as if they occur in isolation from one another. This “one chemical at a time” 
approach has left us with insufficient knowledge about the individual, interactive, and 
cumulative health effects of EDC mixtures. Epidemiological studies can address three broad 
questions related to EDC mixtures.199 First, given the large number of environmental agents 
to which humans are exposed, there is a need to identify those most strongly associated with 
adverse child health outcomes, particularly when little data are available about the toxicity 
of individual exposures. Second, multiple EDCs may have a synergistic association with 
health outcomes by disrupting the homeostasis of compensatory mechanisms. Finally, 
cumulative exposure to certain classes of EDCs (e.g., phthalates) could adversely impact 
child health when individual components of the mixture act via common biological 
pathways and cumulative exposure to these individual agents is sufficient to induce an 
adverse effect.
A recent workshop at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences brought 
together leaders in the fields of epidemiology, biostatistics, and toxicology to develop, 
implement, and compare different methods of quantifying the health effects of 
environmental chemical mixtures.200,201 Several methods showed promise in addressing

 questions related to EDC mixtures. For instance, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection 
Operator and elastic net methods can identify individual EDCs associated with health 
outcomes and their interactions while controlling for co-pollutant confounding. Bayesian 
Kernel Machine Regression is another method that can estimate the health effects of 
individual EDCs of concern while also examining potential interactions, non-linear dose-
response functions, and co-pollutant confounding.202
Weighted quantile sum regression is a method that shows promise for quantifying the 
cumulative effect of EDC exposures while also estimating the relative contribution of 
individual components of the mixture to the health outcome of interest.203,204 Other 
methods of estimating the cumulative effect of EDC mixtures include mathematically 
weighting the sum of individual components of the mixture by their biological potency (e.g., 
toxic equivalency factors for dioxins),205 or quantifying the biological activity in 
biospecimens.206 These summation methods of examining cumulative exposures are likely 
too simplistic since they assume a single mechanism of EDC action. Thus, there is a need to 
develop methods that incorporate the potency of EDCs on multiple biological pathways.
By implementing methods that account for chemical mixtures, we are likely to identify 
previously undocumented chemical risk factors for childhood disease, susceptible 
subgroups, or aggregate exposures that should be considered in the risk assessment process. 
However, the performance of these methods has not been fully evaluated and a simulation 
study showed that some of these methods do not have perfect sensitivity and in some 
situations, there may be a high rate of false positives. 207
Exposure Misclassification
The episodic nature of many EDC exposures and short biological half-lives of their 
biomarkers can cause exposure misclassification. Exposure misclassification represents a 
signal to noise problem, where the misclassification results in a less precise estimate of an 
individual’s exposure and this makes it more difficult to rank their exposure relative to other 
individuals in the study. If misclassification is not systematically different with respect to 
childhood health outcomes, then the study will have reduced statistical power to detect an 
association and observed associations will be attenuated towards the null.
A simulation study showed that at least 10 estimates of exposure per individual may be 
required to ensure adequate statistical power, especially for chemical exposures like BPA 
and DEHP.80 One solution is to collect multiple urine samples from the same individual 
during a specific developmental period (e.g., 2nd trimester) and then create a pooled 
specimen for each individual using an equal volume of sample from their repeated 
samples.79,80 One disadvantage to the pooling method is that it does not allow for the 
examination of discrete periods of heightened vulnerability unless multiple pools are created 
for different periods of development. When a single measurement of exposure is available, 
statistical techniques like regression calibration could correct non-differential measurement 
error.80 To date, studies have not used regression calibration methods to correct for non-
differential EDC exposure misclassification, but studies of air pollutants have successfully 
used these methods to study a variety of health effects while accounting for exposure 
measurement error.208

 Despite the potential for non-differential misclassification of BPA and phthalate exposures, 
several studies have observed that early life BPA or phthalate exposures are associated with 
adverse child neurodevelopment. If non-differential misclassification is present, then this 
suggests that observed associations may be attenuated towards the null and true associations 
may be much stronger. However, non-causal explanations should not be ruled out, including 
confounding by traditional risk factors for adverse neurodevelopment or correlated co-
pollutants.
Confounding
As is the case for all observational studies, there is the potential for confounding factors 
associated with both early-life EDC exposures and child health to bias study results. 
Socioeconomic factors are important determinants of childhood health and some chemical 
exposures. For instance, in the case of obesogens, many strong determinants of adiposity 
(e.g., diet) are correlated with lifestyle factors (e.g., maternal diet) that may also be 
associated with EDC exposures (Figure 2). Thus, to determine if a given EDC has 
obesogenic effects independent of other predictors of obesity, it is necessary to measure and 
control for factors like diet, physical activity, breast feeding, etc. When examining 
neurotoxic EDCs, many socioeconomic factors associated with exposure are also associated 
with parental IQ or behavior and the quality of caregiving environment, which are important 
determinants of child IQ and behavior. Finally, it is necessary to consider potential 
confounding from other EDC exposures since the effect of one EDC may be misattributed to 
another correlated co-pollutant.
Subject matter knowledge should guide the selection of potential confounders and various 
approaches can be used to identify a parsimonious statistical model (For an example, see the 
directed acyclic graphs and change in estimate approach development by Weng and 
colleagues).209 It is imperative to note that it is not appropriate to adjust for variables that 
are caused by EDC exposure and causes of poor childhood health (i.e., causal intermediates) 
since this ‘over-adjustment bias’ may mask causal associations.210 For instance, prenatal 
PFAS exposures are associated with lower birth weight and increased risk of childhood 
obesity. Moreover, birth weight is a determinant of childhood obesity risk.211 Thus, 
adjusting for birth weight might bias associations between PFAS and risk of childhood 
obesity.
Discrete Periods of Heightened Vulnerability
The potential effects of EDCs could be dependent on the timing of exposure given the 
possibility of unique periods of vulnerability to environmental stressors. For instance, the 
effect of EDC exposures on neurodevelopment could depend on different biological 
mechanisms specific to prenatal (e.g., neurulation) and postnatal (e.g., synaptic pruning) 
neurodevelopmental processes.18 This could be a reason for some of the heterogeneity in the 
results of the studies discussed above. This highlights the need for prospective studies with 
serial measures of EDC exposure across the lifespan, as well as appropriate statistical 
methods to identify periods of heightened vulnerability.199

 Sexually Dimorphic Associations
Some associations between EDC exposures and childhood health are sexually dimorphic and 
EDCs may be capable of acting in a sex-specific manner given the important role that 
gonadal hormones play in shaping some sexually dimorphic traits.59,60,69,112,117 For 
instance, in a prospective cohort, prenatal exposure to anti-androgenic phthalates was 
associated with reduced masculine play behavior in boys, but not girls.69 The identification 
of sex-specific effects in epidemiological studies will require larger sample sizes than most 
studies conducted to date.
Advice for Clinicians and Concerned Patients
Presently, there are no evidence-based methods for reducing EDC exposures, but there are 
some general recommendations that clinicians could give to concerned patients. For EDCs 
found in the diet (e.g., BPA, DEHP, and PFAS), eating a balanced diet may be one way to 
avoid exposure from any one foodstuff, but this advice has not been empirically evaluated. 
Intervention studies show that decreasing or eliminating canned or packaged food 
consumption is effective at reducing BPA and DEHP exposure.73,100 An intervention study 
showed that handling BPA-containing thermal receipts was an important route of exposure 
and that wearing gloves could reduce BPA exposure from this route.102 Another study found 
some evidence that children who have handle thermal receipts may have higher BPA 
exposure.109
Individuals may be able to reduce their exposure to DEP and DnBP by reducing or 
eliminating the use of some lotions, cosmetics, and colognes/perfumes.76,212 However, there 
are no requirements for personal care products to include these phthalates in their ingredient 
list, making it difficult to avoid this source of exposure. Individuals can reduce triclosan 
exposure by avoiding triclosan-containing toothpastes. However, because triclosan-
containing toothpastes are clinically indicated for some individuals, the benefits and risk of 
continued use should consider the specific conditions and susceptibilities of the individual 
(e.g., pregnancy). Finally, granular activated carbon water filtration systems may be effective 
at reducing PFAS exposure when consuming PFAS contaminated water,213 but this may 
have a minimal effect on total PFAS body burden when diet is the predominant source of 
PFAS exposure.214
Conclusions
Exposure to BPA, phthalates, triclosan, and PFAS is ubiquitous and occurs during 
potentially sensitive periods of development that are important in the etiology of childhood 
neurodevelopmental disorders and obesity. The available research suggests that prenatal 
BPA and phthalate exposures are related to adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in children. 
Furthermore, prenatal PFAS exposure is related to reduced fetal growth and excess 
childhood adiposity. While this review did not compare the findings of animal or laboratory 
studies to the results of epidemiological ones, future reviews or risk assessments of these 
chemicals should include this important feature of establishing causality.215

 We can make stronger inferences about the role of EDCs in the etiology of childhood 
disease by quantifying the impact of chemical mixtures, reducing exposure misclassification, 
identifying sexually-dimorphic associations and periods of enhanced vulnerability, and 
collecting data on relevant potential confounders in prospective cohort studies. Ultimately, 
quantifying the impact of EDC exposures on child health could lead to the identification of 
susceptible sub-populations and reduction of EDC exposures via public health interventions.

Neurodevelopmental Disorders of Childhood
Many neurodevelopmental disorders develop during childhood, with prevalence in the 
United States of 1.5% for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), 6.7% for attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 7.7% for specific learning disabilities (LD).216,217 The 
clinical presentation of these disorders varies between and within a diagnosis. For ASD, 
children have deficits in social communication and interactions, as well as repetitive, 
restricted, and stereotypic behaviors. Within the ASD diagnosis, deficits can be mild or 
severe and accompanied by intellectual disabilities (IQ<70) and substantial 
comorbidities.218 For ADHD, children present with hyperactivity, inattention, and poor 
impulse control, and display deficits in executive function (e.g., inhibition, behavioral 
regulation, and planning/organizing). ADHD diagnosis is classified into hyperactive/
impulsive or inattentive subtypes.219 LD is characterized by difficulties learning and 
using specific academic skills (e.g., reading and mathematics) and is distinct from 
intellectual disability, which is defined by global impairments in cognitive function.
Many epidemiological studies assess continuously distributed measures of functional 
domains related to clinical phenotypes instead of clinical diagnoses.220,221 For instance, 
global measures of cognition (i.e., IQ) and academic performance can be used to study 
whether EDC exposures affect intellectual abilities and specific academic skills, 
respectively. Continuous outcomes are advantageous since they provide a relative ranking 
of an individual’s ability/behavior, which enhances statistical power. Moreover, clinical 
diagnosis could misclassify individuals since they may fail to detect earlier 
manifestations of disease and diagnostic thresholds are often set at arbitrary levels that 
change over time. By examining continuous neurobehavioral measures, epidemiological 
studies can determine if EDC exposures are associated with shifts in these traits at the 
population level, which could result in increased prevalence/incidence of clinical 
disorders (Figure B1).

 Figure B1. 
Density Distribution of IQ in EDC Unexposed and Exposed Populations
Figure B1 represents the distribution of IQ in two populations of one million individuals 
each. The grey line signifies the threshold for IQ scores consistent with intellectual 
disabilities (IQ<70).
In the unexposed population, the mean IQ is 100 (standard deviation=15), while in the 
exposed population the mean IQ is 95 (standard deviation=15). This 5-point shift in IQ 
results in nearly a doubling in the proportion of people with IQ scores consistent with 
intellectual disabilities (IQ<70) in the exposed population (4.48%) compared to the 
unexposed population (2.27%).

Prevalence and Origins of Childhood Obesity
Childhood obesity is a major threat to public health in the United States, with the 
prevalence rising from 7% in 1980 to 17% in 2012.222 Obesity is also a major public 
health problem globally, with 10–14% of adults worldwide being overweight or obese in 
2008.223 Childhood obesity increases the risk of type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
and metabolic syndrome, and has adverse effects on pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and

The principal cause of obesity is caloric imbalance from excess calorie intake and 
insufficient physical activity. However, there is considerable evidence that the in utero 
and neonatal environments program the developing fetus and infant for obesity risk.1,2 A 
non-optimal fetal or infant environment can lead to enduring functional and structural 
changes to the body that increase obesity risk by re-programming neuroendocrine 
systems involved in growth, energy metabolism, appetite, adipogenesis, and glucose-
insulin homeostasis.32–34 These environmental stressors may program the fetus or infant 
towards a ‘thrifty phenotype’ that efficiently stores excess calories in a postnatal 
environment with abundant calories and reduced physical activity. Thus, children with 
this phenotype will efficiently store excess calories as fat, have altered insulin 
homeostasis, and ultimately develop a cardiometabolic disease profile.

 Key Points
•
Endocrine disrupting chemicals may increase the risk of childhood 
neurodevelopmental disorders or obesity by disrupting hormonally-mediated 
processes during critical periods of development.
•
The developing fetus, infant, and child may have enhanced sensitivity to 
environmental stressors like EDCs and greater exposure to some EDCs 
because of developmentally appropriate behavior, anatomy, and physiology.
•
The available epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal bisphenol A 
and phthalate exposure is associated with adverse neurobehavioral outcomes 
in children, but not excess adiposity or risk of obesity/overweight.
•
Epidemiological studies show that prenatal PFAS exposure is associated with 
reduced fetal growth, excess adiposity, and risk of being overweight or obese, 
but not neurobehavioral outcomes.
•
Improving EDC exposure measurement, reducing confounding bias, 
identifying discrete periods of vulnerability and sexually dimorphic 
associations, and quantifying the effects of EDC mixtures will enhance 
inferences made from epidemiological studies.
