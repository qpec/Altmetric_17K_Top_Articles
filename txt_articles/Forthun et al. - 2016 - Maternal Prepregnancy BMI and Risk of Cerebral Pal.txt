OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and risk of 
cerebral palsy (CP) in offspring.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 188 788 children in the Mothers and Babies in 
Norway and Denmark CP study, using data from 2 population-based, prospective birth 
cohorts: the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and the Danish National Birth 
Cohort. Prepregnancy BMI was classified as underweight (BMI <18.5), lower normal weight 
(BMI 18.5–22.9), upper normal weight (BMI 23.0–24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9), and 
obese (BMI ≥30). CP diagnoses were obtained from the national CP registries. Associations 
between maternal prepregnancy BMI and CP in offspring were investigated by using log-
binomial regression models.
RESULTS: The 2 cohorts had 390 eligible cases of CP (2.1 per 1000 live-born children). 
Compared with mothers in the lower normal weight group, mothers in the upper normal 
group had a 40% excess risk of having a child with CP (relative risk [RR], 1.35; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.78). Excess risk was 60% (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.21–2.01) for 
overweight mothers and 60% (RR, 1.55; 95% CI 1.11–2.18) for obese mothers. The risk of 
CP increased ∼4% for each unit increase in BMI (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02–1.06). Estimates 
changed little with adjustment for mother’s occupational status, age, and smoking habits.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher prepregnancy maternal BMI was associated with increased risk of CP in 
offspring.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Cerebral palsy 
(CP) is the most common physical disability in 
childhood, but little is known about its underlying 
causes. Several prenatal risk factors for CP have 
been identifi
 ed including maternal infection, 
diseases, and nutritional defi
 ciencies, suggesting 
that maternal factors may be important.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Our study suggests that 
the risk of CP in offspring increases with maternal 
prepregnancy BMI.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group 
of disorders characterized by 
disturbances in motor function 
caused by a nonprogressive lesion 
of the fetal or infant brain, often 
accompanied by visual and hearing 
impairment, learning disabilities, 
or epilepsy. 
1 CP affects around 2 
per 1000 children and is the most 
common cause of physical disability 
in childhood. 
2 CP may be divided 
into subtypes that differ in severity, 
type of motor impairment, and 
possibly etiology. Preterm birth and 
intrauterine growth restriction are 
strongly associated with CP, 
but it is not clear if they are causal 
factors or not. 
3 Several other 
prenatal risk factors including 
maternal infection, diseases, and 
nutritional deficiencies have 
also been identified, indicating 
that maternal conditions may be 
important.

The prevalence of overweight and 
obesity among pregnant women is 
increasing worldwide with adverse 
effects on maternal and child 
health. 
6 Obese pregnant women 
(BMI >29.9) have increased risk of 
gestational diabetes, hypertension, 
and preeclampsia, and their offspring 
are at increased risk of preterm birth, 
macrosomia, complications during 
delivery, and perinatal death. 
6 
 
–9 
Maternal obesity is also associated 
with birth defects, in particular 
neural tube defects. 
10 We used 
pooled data from 2 large prospective 
Nordic birth cohorts to investigate 
the association between BMI before 
pregnancy and risk of CP in offspring, 
both overall and for various subtypes 
of CP.
METHODS
Study Population
The study is based on data from 
the Mothers and Babies in Norway 
and Denmark (MOBAND CP) cohort 
of 211 010 births. MOBAND CP 
comprises harmonized data from 2 
population-based, prospective birth 
cohorts: the Norwegian Mother and 
Child Cohort Study (MoBa) 
11 and 
the Danish National Birth Cohort 
(DNBC). 
12 In the DNBC, 100 417 
pregnant women were recruited by 
their general practitioner nationwide 
at the first pregnancy visit in the 
period from 1996 to 2002. In MoBa, 
112 509 pregnant women, in the 
period from 1999 to 2008, were 
recruited when invited to the first 
ultrasound examination of the fetus 
at around pregnancy week 17 to 18. 
The recruitment was nationwide 
and included 50 of 52 hospitals with 
maternity units. Information was 
collected at the same time during 
pregnancy in both cohorts, although 
in Denmark, telephone interviews 
were used whereas in Norway, 
information was collected by postal 
questionnaires. We used data from 
the first interview/questionnaire 
at around pregnancy week 17, with 
supplemental Danish data from the 
fourth interview 18 months after 
birth for selected variables. Data 
from the DNBC were linked to the 
Danish Medical Birth Registry, 
 
13 
and data from MoBa were linked 
to the Norwegian Medical Birth 
Registry. 
14 We identified cases of CP 
by linkage to the Danish Cerebral 
Palsy Registry15 and the Norwegian 
Cerebral Palsy Registry. 
16 The Danish 
Cerebral Palsy Registry is regarded 
as complete for the birth cohort in 
the DNBC, whereas the Norwegian 
CP registry is not complete for 
MoBa. To identify the missing cases, 
the Norwegian cohort was linked 
to the Norwegian Patient Registry 
(NPR). The NPR comprises data 
from all hospitals and outpatient 
clinics, including all institutions 
that diagnose children with CP. 
17 
Diagnoses of CP in the registry were 
validated through medical record 
review by 2 pediatric neurologists. 
18 
The maximum follow-up time in 
the Norwegian cohort was 6 to 16 
years, whereas in Denmark, the 
maximum follow-up time was 9 to 15 
years. Only nonacquired cases were 
included in the study. Variables were 
harmonized through discussions 
and revisions by both Danish and 
Norwegian collaborators.
In the study population of 211 010 
births, we excluded all stillbirths, all 
children who died before 1 year of 
age (as these are not included in the 
CP registries), and those with missing 
information on maternal BMI ( 
Fig 1).

Maternal Prepregnancy BMI
Maternal BMI (kg/m2) was 
estimated from self-reported 
prepregnancy weight and height in 
the first interview/questionnaire and 
included either as a continuous or 
categorized variable in the models. 
BMI was categorized according to 
the World Health Organization’s 
guidelines as underweight (BMI 
<18.5), lower normal weight (BMI 
18.5–22.9), upper normal weight 
(BMI 23.0–24.9), overweight (BMI 
25–29.9) and obese (BMI ≥30). 
19
CP
CP overall and the main subtypes 
of CP were used as outcomes in 
the analyses. Subtypes of CP were 
classified as spastic unilateral, spastic 
bilateral, dyskinetic, and ataxic 
according to the classification used 
by the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy 
in Europe. 
1
Covariates
We assessed potential confounding 
by exploring the following covariates: 
maternal socioeconomic status, 
smoking, age, physical activity, and 
paternal BMI. Socioeconomic status 
was based on available information 
on occupational status given in 
the first interview/questionnaire 
around pregnancy week 17. Level of 
education is generally considered a 
more valid proxy of socioeconomic 
status than occupational status. 
20 
Information on years of completed 
education reported in the first 
questionnaire was available in the 
Norwegian cohort. In the Danish 
cohort, however, women were not 
asked about education until the 
interview conducted when the child 
was 18 months old, and only about 
70% responded to this interview. 
Therefore, we used information on 
education from the Norwegian cohort 
only in the sensitivity analyses, 
whereas in the main analyses, 
socioeconomic status was based on 
occupational status. Women were 
classified as employed, unemployed, 
student, or receiving benefits or 
pension. Maternal smoking was 
based on number of cigarettes per 
day reported in the first interview/
questionnaire, categorized as 0, 1 
to 9, and ≥10 cigarettes per day, 
and thereby reflect the amount of 
smoking at the time of the interview/
filling in the questionnaire. Maternal 
age was categorized as <20, 20 to 24, 
25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, and ≥40 
years. Paternal BMI was reported by 
mothers in the first questionnaire in 
the Norwegian cohort (prepregnancy 
BMI) and in the fourth interview 
(18 months after birth) in the 
Danish cohort and was categorized 
in the same way as maternal BMI. 
Information on physical activity 
in the first part of pregnancy was 
retrieved from the first interview/
questionnaire. Recreational physical 
activity included brisk walking, 
running/jogging/orienteering, 
bicycling, training studio/weight 
training, aerobics, dancing, skiing, 
ball sports, swimming, and riding. 
Being physically active was defined 
as taking part in physical activity at 
least once a week.
Factors that are associated with CP, 
but which may be consequences of 
the brain injury rather than causes 
of it (preterm birth and conditions 
of the newborn) were not adjusted 
for. In addition, we did not adjust for 
risk factors potentially on the causal 
pathway between prepregnancy 
BMI and CP (mediators), such as 
preeclampsia and diabetes, because 
this may result in “collider bias.” 
21
Statistical Analyses
Differences in proportions between 
the cohorts were tested by using 
χ2 tests. The prevalence of CP was 
calculated overall, within each group 
of BMI, and within deciles of BMI. We 
estimated crude relative risks (RR) 
of CP from log-binomial regression 
models with corresponding 95% 
confidence interval (CI). BMI was 
included either as a continuous 
(including 1 decimal) or categorized 
variable. In the subtype analyses, 
each subtype was coded as a binary 
outcome, with children not diagnosed 
with CP as controls. To account for 
possible dependency among births 
by the same mother, we used robust 
SEs that allowed for within-mother 
clustering. We investigated whether 
the effect of BMI and physical activity 
on the risk of CP differed between 
the Danish and Norwegian cohorts by 
including an interaction term in the 
models. Analyses were performed by 
using Intercooled Stata, version 12.1 
(Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
Written informed consent was 
obtained from all participating 
mothers in MoBa and DNBC at the 
time of enrollment, and licenses from 
the national data protecting agencies 
were obtained. Linkage of MoBa with 
the National CP registry of Norway 
and the NPR was additionally 
approved by Regional Committees for 
Medical and Health Research Ethics 
South-East, Norway (2012/1738). 
The DNBC has been approved by the 
Danish Committee on Biomedical 
Research Ethics (case no. [KF] 
01-471/94).
RESULTS
Among the 188 788 children 
included in the total study cohort, we 
identified 390 with CP (2.1 per 1000 
children): 177 cases from DNBC (2.0 
per 1000 children) and 213 cases 
from MoBa (2.2 per 1000 children) 
(P = .5). About 21% of the children 
had mothers who were overweight, 
and 9% had mothers who were obese 
before pregnancy ( 
Table 1). In both 
cohorts, obese women were more 
likely to be unemployed or receive 
benefits or pension and to smoke 
during pregnancy, and were less 
likely to be physically active than 
normal weight women ( 
Table 1). The 
proportion of obese fathers increased 
with increasing maternal BMI. 
Overall, Danish women were more 
likely to smoke or receive benefits

or pensions than Norwegian women 
(Supplemental Table 4).
The prevalence of CP increased 
steadily with maternal BMI, ranging 
from 1.4 per 1000 children in the 
first decile (BMI, 13.2–19.4) to 2.5 
per 1000 children in the 10th decile 
(BMI, 29.4–64.4). This increase was 
seen within each cohort separately 
( 
Fig 2). The prevalences of CP were 
statistically significantly different 
between the cohorts in only the 10th 
decile (1.6 per 1000 children in DNBC 
and 3.3 per 1000 children in MoBa 
(P = .02). We therefore pooled the 2 
cohorts for the main analyses.
When considering BMI as a 
continuous variable, the risk of CP 
increased by ∼4% for each unit 
increase in BMI (RR, 1.04; 95% CI,

1.02–1.06). Mothers with upper 
normal BMI had a 40% excess risk 
of having a child with CP (RR, 1.35; 
95% CI, 1.03–1.78) compared with 
women in the lower normal BMI 
group ( 
Table 2). Excess risks were 
∼60% for both overweight and 
obese mothers (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 
1.21–2.01 and RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 
1.11–2.18, respectively). Adjusting 
for maternal occupational status, 
smoking habits in the first part of 
pregnancy and maternal age at birth 
hardly affected the results ( 
Table 2). 
Among obese women, a difference 
was observed between the cohorts. 
Although no significant excess risk of 
having a child with CP was observed 
among obese Danish women (RR, 
0.78; 95% CI, 0.42–1.48), in Norway, 
obesity was associated with a 
130% excess risk (RR, 2.32; 95% CI, 
1.53–3.50) (P = .008) (Supplemental 
Table 5).
With regard to CP subtypes, we 
observed an increasing risk with 
increasing BMI for all subtypes 
( 
Fig 3). The risks of unilateral and 
bilateral spastic CP increased by 
∼3% (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00–1.07 
and RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.06, 
respectively). Stronger but more 
imprecise associations were found 
for dyskinetic CP (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 
1.02–1.12) and ataxic CP (RR, 1.11; 
95% CI, 1.05–1.18).
Paternal obesity has previously been 
found to be an independent risk 
factor for autism spectrum disorders 
(ASDs) within the Norwegian 
cohort. 
22 Paternal BMI was not 
associated with CP in offspring 
( 
Table 3), nor did adjustment for 
paternal BMI affect the results when 
using maternal prepregnancy BMI 
as a continuous predictor (RR, 1.05; 
95% CI, 1.03–1.07). Similarly, the 
prevalence of CP was not affected 
by mothers’ level of physical activity 
( 
Table 3). Adjusting for physical 
activity did not affect the association 
between continuous prepregnancy 
BMI and CP (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 
1.02–1.06).
As a sensitivity analyses, we 
performed all analyses adjusting for 
education instead of employment 
status in the Norwegian cohort. 
Results were similar (upper normal 
weight RR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.11–2.42; 
overweight RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.32–
2.74; and obese RR, 2.64; 95% CI, 
1.71–4.06).
DISCUSSION
We found an increasing risk of CP in 
offspring with increasing maternal 
prepregnancy BMI. Compared with 
women in the lower normal BMI 
group, women in the upper normal 
BMI group had a 40% excess risk, and 
women in the overweight and obese 
groups each had a 60% excess risk 
of CP in their offspring. Continuously 
increased risks with increasing BMI 
were found for all individual CP 
subtypes.

Our findings are in agreement 
with recently published studies on 
maternal obesity and risk of CP, 
 
23, 
 
24 
but demonstrate an association 
across the entire BMI scale less 
explored in previous studies. In a 
Swedish case-control study, Ahlin 
et al 
25 found a 7% increased odds 
of CP for every 1 unit increase in 
maternal BMI (odds ratio, 1.07; 
95% CI, 1.03–1.12) for babies born 
at term, but the authors did not 
state when BMI was measured. An 
increased risk was found for all 
subtypes, but the estimates were 
only statistically significant for all 
spastic and unilateral spastic CP. In 
contrast, a case-control study from 
Australia including 587 cases and 
1154 controls found no association 
between maternal BMI at the 
beginning of pregnancy and odds of 
CP. 
26 The information on maternal 
BMI was based on self-report at 
recruitment when the children were 
between 5 and 18 years old. Recall 
bias as well as bias in recruitment 
may have contributed to the null 
finding.
The major strengths of this study 
are the prospective design, the large 
sample of cases, and the possibility 
of investigating CP subtypes. By 
combining 2 of the world’s largest 
birth cohorts, we are able to examine 
a prospective sample of exceptional 
size, not affected by maternal recall 
bias. Both pregnancy cohorts were 
linked to national CP registries where 
all diagnoses have been validated by 
neuropediatricians.
The Danish and Norwegian birth 
cohorts were planned in close 
collaboration and have many 
similarities in design and type of 
information collected. Even so, there 
are some important differences in 
how the information was obtained 
and in the format and content of 
the questions. This can lead to loss 
of information when harmonizing 
variables and reduce the ability 
to control for confounding in the 
analyses. There was a self-selection 
of healthier women into both 
cohorts. 
11, 
 
27 This could result in effect 
estimates that differ from those in 
the source population, to the degree 
that such selection depends both 
on prepregnancy BMI and CP risk. 
It is reassuring, however, that other 
well-established exposure–outcome 
associations have not been found 
to be affected in either the Danish 
or Norwegian cohort, even though 
self-selection can affect prevalence 
estimates in the cohorts. 
28, 
 
29 Another 
possible limitation is that BMI is self-
reported. Maternal BMI has not been 
validated in MoBa, but a previous 
study validating self-reported BMI in 
DNBC found a slight but consistent 
and increasing underreporting 
of weight across the entire BMI 
scale when compared with weight 
reported in antenatal care.30 This 
could result in an underestimation of 
the adverse effect of overweight and 
obesity on CP. However, the same 
study found agreement with regard 
to BMI categories between maternal 
self-reported data in DNBC and data 
recorded by general practitioners in 
antenatal care in 91% of cases. 
30
We excluded all stillborn and infant 
deaths in the analyses. Children born 
with CP probably have a higher risk 
of dying in their first year of life, 
before they have a chance of being 
diagnosed. Because maternal obesity 
also increases the risk of infant death, 
 
8 
it is possible that the exclusion of 
early deaths biases our estimates 
toward the null.
As far as we know, no previous 
studies on maternal BMI and risk of 
CP in offspring have taken paternal 
BMI into account. We found no 
association between paternal BMI 
and risk of CP, and paternal BMI did 
not attenuate the effect of maternal 
BMI on risk of CP. This suggests 
that the observed association is 
not due to genetic factors related 
to overweight, but could be 
due to a direct harmful effect of 
maternal overweight through the 
intrauterine environment. Maternal 
obesity increases the risk of 
pregnancy complications, including 
preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, 
and cesarean delivery, all of which 
are associated with CP. 
4, 
 
5 Infants 
of obese mothers are more often 
macrosomic, increasing the risk of 
a difficult labor and, consequently, 
birth injury. It is well known that the

risk of CP is increased in children 
who are small for their gestational 
age, but the risk is also elevated in 
children who are born large for their 
gestational age. 
31
Previous studies have found 
an increased risk of congenital 
abnormalities with high BMI (BMI 
> 30), in particular neural tube 
defects. It has been suggested 
that adiposity might impair folate 
status, reducing the amount of 
folate available to the fetus (low 
folate being a well-established risk 
factor for neural tube defects). 
10 
We are not aware of any studies 
linking maternal intake of folate 
and risk of CP in offspring. Folic 
acid supplements have been 
associated with a lower risk of other 
neurodevelopmental disorders, such 
as ASDs 
32 and language delay, 
 
33 
although the association with ASDs 
was not replicated in a recent study 
within the Danish birth cohort. 
34
Another biologically plausible 
hypothesis linking BMI and CP is 
through the effects of inflammation. 
Intrauterine infection and 
inflammation are established risk 
factors for CP. 
35 Obesity is a chronic 
low-grade inflammatory condition, 
 
36 
but it is not clear whether maternal 
obesity-induced inflammation 
might have adverse effects on the 
developing human brain. However, 
a study in offspring of rats fed a 
high-fat diet during pregnancy found 
increased inflammation within the 
brain at birth. 
37
For obese women (BMI ≥30), 
there was a difference between 
the cohorts; offspring of obese 
Danish women had no excess 
risk of CP, whereas offspring of 
obese Norwegian women did. 
We explored various possible 
explanations for this difference, 
without success. If, because of 
cultural differences, Danish obese 
mothers were more physically 
active and generally healthier than 
Norwegian obese mothers, then 
that could possibly explain the 
contradictory difference in results. 
However, there was no evidence 
of a stronger selection of healthier 
obese women into the Danish 
cohort. The rates of stillbirth and 
infant death are similar among 
the obese in the DNBC as among 
the obese in the Danish population. 
8, 
 
30 
Obstetric care is very similar in 
Norway and Denmark. We could 
not find any important differences 
in the rate of complications among 
overweight women in the 2 cohorts. 
In addition, a higher proportion 
of obese women in the Norwegian 
cohort were physically active 
compared with obese women in 
the Danish cohort. The apparent 
difference may be because of 
unmeasured differences between 
the 2 cohorts, or random variation.
CONCLUSIONS
We found a continuously increasing 
risk of CP with increasing maternal 
prepregnancy BMI. The risk was 
significantly elevated both for 
women in the upper normal weight, 
overweight, and obese groups 
compared with normal weight 
women. Although we cannot draw 
any conclusions about the underlying 
mechanisms for this association, the 
clinical implications may become all 
the more important if prepregnancy 
BMI continues to increase.
