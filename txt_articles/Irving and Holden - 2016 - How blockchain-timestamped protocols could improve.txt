Abstract
Trust in scientific research is diminished by evidence that data are being
manipulated. Outcome switching, data dredging and selective publication
are some of the problems that undermine the integrity of published
research. Here we report a proof-of-concept study  using a ‘blockchain’ as a
low cost, independently verifiable method that could be widely and readily
used to audit and confirm the reliability of scientific studies.

 Trust in scientific research is diminished by evidence that data are 
being manipulated1. Outcome switching, data dredging and selective 
publication are some of the problems that undermine the integrity 
of published research. The declaration of Helsinki states that every 
clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database 
before recruitment of the first subject2. Yet despite the creation of 
numerous trial registries problems such as differences between pre-
specified and reported outcomes persist3–5. If readers doubt the trust-
worthiness of scientific research then it is largely valueless to them 
and those they influence. Here we propose using a ‘blockchain’ as a 
low cost, independently verifiable method that could be widely and 
readily used to audit and confirm the reliability of scientific studies.
A blockchain is a distributed, permanent, timestamped public ledger 
of transactions. In doing so it provides a method for establishing 
the existence of a document at a particular time that can be inde-
pendently verified by any interested party. When someone wishes 
to add to it, participants in the network – all of whom have copies 
of the existing blockchain – run algorithms to evaluate and verify 
the proposed action. Once the majority of ‘nodes’ confirm that a 
transaction is valid i.e. matches the blockchain history then the new 
transaction will be approved and added to the chain. Once a block 
of data is recorded on a blockchain ledger it is extremely difficult to 
change or remove it as doing so would require changing the record 
on many thousands computers worldwide. This prevents tamper-
ing or future revision of a submitted timestamped record. Such dis-
tributive version control has been increasingly used in fields such as 
software development, engineering and genetics but to date has not 
been applied to the reporting of clinical studies.
Methods
In this proof-of-concept study we used publically available docu-
mentation from a recently reported randomized control trial6,7. 
A copy of the clinicaltrials.gov study protocol was prepared based 
on it’s pre-specified endpoints and planned analyses which was 
saved as an unformatted text file6 (Dataset 1). The document’s 
SHA256 digest for the text was then calculated by entering text 
from the trial protocol into an SHA256 calculator (Xorbin©). This 
was then converted into a bitcoin private key and corresponding 
public key using a bitcoin wallet. To do this a new account was cre-
ated in Strongcoin©8 and the SHA256 digest used as the account 
password (private key). From this Strongcoin© automatically gen-
erated a corresponding Advanced Encryption Standard 256 bit 
public key. An arbitrary amount of bitcoin was then sent to a cor-
responding bitcoin address. To verify the existence of the document 
a second researcher was sent the originally prepared unformatted 
document. An SHA256 digest was created as previously described 
and a corresponding private key and public key generated. The exact 
replication of the public key (1AHjCz2oEUTH8js4S8vViC8N-
Kph4zCACXH) was then used to prove the documents existence 
in the blockchain using blockchain.info©9. The protocol document 
was then edited to reflect any changes to pre-specified outcomes as 
reported by the COMPare group3. This was used to create a further 
SHA256 and corresponding public and private keys3.

Results
Incorporating a transaction into the blockchain using a public 
and private key generated from the SHA256 digest of the trial 
protocol provided a timestamped record that the protocol was 
at least as old as the transaction generated. The transaction took 
under five minutes to complete. The process cost was free as the 
nominal bitcoin transaction could be retrieved. Researchers were 
able to search for the transaction on the blockchain, confirm the 
date when the transaction occurred and verify the authenticity of 
the original protocol by generating identical public and private 
keys. Any changes made to the original document generated dif-
ferent public and private keys indicating that protocol had been 
altered. This included assessment of the edited protocol reflecting 
pre-specified outcomes not reported or non-pre-specified outcomes 
now reported in the final paper.
Discussion
Fraud or carelessness in scientific methods erodes the confidence 
in medicine as a whole which is essential to the performance of 
its function1. The method described here provides an immutable 
record of the existence, integrity and ownership of a specific trial 
protocol. It is a simple and cheap way of allowing a third party 
to audit and externally validate outcomes and analyses specified 
a-priori with the findings reported a-posteriori. The method pre-
vents researchers from changing endpoints or analyses after see-
ing their study results without reporting such changes. Transaction 
codes could be recorded in scientific papers, reference databases 
or trial registries to facilitate external verification. Making changes 
to pre-specified text in a document or trying to bury a protocol in 
a trial registry would simply not be possible. Attempts to fraudu-
lently prepare multiple protocols in advance would be technically 
possible but would require a considerable amount of advanced 
planning and would leave behind a publically available trail of 
evidence that could not be destroyed.
The blockchain offers a number of advantages over trial registries 
or publishing protocols. Firstly, the blockchain would not be con-
fined to the validation of clinical trials. The approach could be 
used for a whole range of observational and experimental studies 
where registries do not currently exist. Secondly, the blockchain 
provides a real-time timestamped record of a protocol. Such preci-
sion is important given persistent problems with protocol registra-
tion after trial initiation10. Thirdly, with over 30,000 trials currently 
published annually and rising, manual outcome verification is 
simply not possible11.
Conclusion
The method we have described allows anyone to verify the exact 
wording and existence of a protocol at a given point in time. It has 
the potential to support automated, extremely robust verification of 
pre-specified and reported outcomes. This evidence should increase 
trust and diminish suspicion in reported data and the conclusions 
that are drawn.

This concept paper describes the potential use of blockchain technology in scientific publishing as a way
to establish a timestamped record of study protocols.
The paper presents a logical structure and the individual parts form a coherent whole. The language is
clear and objective, and the arguments relevant.
The title is elucidative and enticing. The abstract is presented in a synthetic and meaningful way.
The methods are ingenious and relevant to the formulated aims. Sufficient details is provided, allowing for
replication of the experiment. Yet, a more clear delineation of the methodological aspects could be useful
for readers not accustomed with the technical standards and tools used by the authors.
The conclusions are supported by the findings. Logical implications are drawn by the authors.
Timestamped blockchain technology, as proposed by the authors, could revolutionize scientific
publishing.

The title is informative and appropriate. The abstract is well done and provides considerable detail in an
elegant way that focuses on an original innovation for data security.
The research article is a proof of concept study that explains the model and the rationale for why it is
needed and how it will be fit for purpose.
Blockchain improves and expands the role for trial registries or publishing protocols. The approach could
be used for RCTs and a whole range of observational and experimental studies where registries are
needed but do not currently exist. A blockchain provides a real-time time-stamped record of any study
protocol.
Security for data and time stamps that are secure and tamper resistant are a welcome addition for clinical
trials databases as is one secure shared location for all trials registry entries. This needs to be flexible
enough to register change easily and efficiently. The authors supply real data and it is feasible to
accomplish this however for professionals with little time to spare the outside interface will need to be
simplified and steps minimized to retain users. Somewhat like GOOGLE search on a white page. Only
typing a word from one link is required and the search does all the background algorithm loading to
accomplish the task. I am sure this will be the next step in the project.
This present research can be replicated by those with sufficient IT skills and it fulfills a significant gap in
research. Social media is full of information on security breaches, data fraud and altered protocols, this
would be one way to make registering a valid protocol secure and to reduce concerns about trials
transparency as research needs to be registered and reported.
The conclusions are justified and balanced.
