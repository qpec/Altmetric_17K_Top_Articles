ABSTRACT
Background: The state of the economy, changes in federal food
assistance programs, and policies related to nutrition and the food
supply in the United States may influence dietary quality in children
and adolescents.
Objective: We investigated dietary quality trends from 1999 to
2012 in the US child and adolescent population and their associa-
tions with socioeconomic status and participation in federal food
assistance programs.
Design: In this study, a nationally representative sample of 38,487
children and adolescents, aged 2–18 y, in the NHANES from 1999
to 2012 were included. Dietary information was collected with the
use of a 24-h dietary recall. Dietary quality was measured with the
use of the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010).
Results: The mean HEI-2010 increased significantly from 42.5 (95%
CI: 41.2, 43.8) to 50.9 (95% CI: 50.0, 51.8) from 1999 to 2012 (P-linear
trend , 0.001). The reduction in empty calorie intake contributed to
greater than one-third of this improvement in the total HEI-2010. We
also observed significant increases in 9 other HEI-2010 component
scores. However, the HEI-2010 component score for sodium decreased
significantly, which reflected an increase in sodium consumption. We
calculated the covariate-adjusted mean HEI-2010 score in subgroups
that were defined by sociodemographic status and participation in nu-
trition assistance program at each NHANES cycle. Non-Hispanic black
children and adolescents had a consistently lower HEI-2010 than that
of other groups across all NHANES cycles. We observed a trend to-
ward a lower HEI-2010 in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP) participants than in nonparticipants after the 2003–2004 cycle.
We also observed a lower HEI-2010 in participants in the National
School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program
(SBP) than in nonparticipants. In general, participants in the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
appeared to have a higher HEI-2010 than that of nonparticipants.
Conclusions: Although HEI-2010 scores in children and adoles-
cents improved steadily, the overall dietary quality remained poor.
Participants in the SNAP and participants in the National School
Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, or both have lower di-
etary quality than do nonparticipants. Future policy interventions
are needed to continue improvement in dietary quality and to ad-
dress disparities.

INTRODUCTION
Childhood is a critical window for shaping food preferences
and eating behaviors that can, in turn, affect dietary behaviors in
adulthood and life-long risks of chronic diseases (1–4). A
summary indicator for evaluating heathy eating behaviors is
dietary quality. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI),5 which is
a predefined multiple-dimensional dietary index, is one vali-
dated tool for measuring dietary quality (5, 6). Dietary quality of
children and adolescents is influenced by multiple factors in-
cluding parental feeding practices, food advertisements, and the
social context of food desirability and availability (7–11).
Since the beginning of the 21st century, many changes that
may have affected the food environment, including the reau-
thorization of the Child Nutrition Act, updates to the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (12), and expansion of federal food
assistance programs (13), have occurred in the United States.
Therefore, determining the net effect of these changes on dietary
quality is essential for developing future strategies to improve
diets. However, few studies have investigated the temporal trends
in dietary quality in children and adolescents. Most published
studies in children and adolescents have investigated individual
dietary factors such as energy intake or snacking behavior (14,

 15) rather than overall dietary quality. For example, Nielsen et al.
(14) showed that US children and adolescents have obtained more
energy from fast-food and food outlets over time.
Disparities in dietary quality across socioeconomic group
and food insecurity in underserved populations have contributed
to disproportional chronic disease burdens in individuals who
are eligible for federal nutrition assistance programs including
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
and Children (WIC), the National School Lunch Program
(NSLP), and the School Breakfast Program (SBP) that have
aimed to address these disparities and problems of food in-
security and poor nutrition. From 1999 to 2012, the number of
participation in the SNAP increased from 18,183 to 46,609; the
total federal cost of the SNAP increased from $17,821 million
to $78,409 million. However, the effect of these federal pro-
grams on dietary quality in children and adolescents remains
controversial (16). Some programs (e.g., the NSLP) had, until
recently, been based on outdated dietary recommendations and
provided meals that were high in sodium and saturated fat (17),
whereas some evidence has suggested improved dietary quality in
WIC participants (18). Because of reauthorizations of corresponding
legislation, policies and enrollment of these federal programs
have evolved over time.
Therefore, to investigate the disparities in dietary quality in
different socioeconomic groups and the impact of federal nu-
trition assistance programs over time, we examined time trends in
dietary quality and their relation to socioeconomic status and
participants in federal food and nutrition assistance programs
with the use of the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010) in
participants aged 2–18 y in the NHANES from 1999 to 2012.
METHODS
Study design and population
We used data from the NHANES from 1999 through 2012. The
NHANES was approved by the National Center for Health
Statistics Research Ethics Review Board. This study included
a nationally representative sample of 38,487 children and adoles-
cents, aged 2–18 y, in the United States (Supplemental Figure 1).

 according to survey cycles of the NHANES. The detailed study
design of the NHANES has been described elsewhere (19).
Dietary assessment
Dietary information was collected by an interviewer-
administered, computer-assisted, 24-h dietary recall. From
1999 to 2001, a 1-d recall was conducted in person. Since 2002,
an additional day of dietary recall was collected by telephone, and
we took the mean of the 2 dietary recalls. Participants aged $12 y
completed the interview on their own. For children aged #5 y
and those who could not self-report, proxy respondents were
asked to report for them (20). Nutrient intake was calculated
with the use of the USDA nutrient database (21). Food grouping
for data from 1999 to 2004 was based on the MyPyramid
Equivalence Database 2.0 with an addendum from the Center for
Nutrition Policy and Promotion, and food grouping for data
from 2005 to 2012 was based on the USDA’s Food Patterns
Equivalents Database (22).
Sociodemographic information
We used the family poverty-income ratio (PIR) as an indicator
of economic status. Families with a PIR #1.3 were categorized
as low income; families with a PIR between 1.3 and 3.5 were
categorized as medium income; and families with PIR .3.5
were considered high income. The education level and marital
status of the reference person were also collected. The NHANES
classified race as Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and other race
(including mixed race). To improve the sample size, we
combined other Hispanic and other race together as a new other-
race group. On the basis of the age- and sex-specific cutoffs of
the BMI-percentile chart from the CDC, the weight status of
children and adolescents was categorized into 3 groups as fol-
lows: BMI ,85th percentile, BMI from 85th to 95th percentiles,
and BMI $95th percentile (23). There were 2577 missing values
for the PIR (6.7%) and 610 missing values for BMI (1.6%).
Nutrition assistance program participation
We considered 4 federal nutrition assistance programs that are
supported by the USDA including the SNAP; the WIC; and the
National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program,
or both (NSLP/SBP). We treated program participation as binary
variables. Individuals who received the SNAP in the past 12 mo
of the survey were considered to be SNAP participants. Because
the SNAP offers assistance to low-income individuals or
households with limited countable resources and income #130%
of the poverty level (24), we restricted our analysis to in-
dividuals with a PIR #1.3 (n = 15,587). The WIC provides
supplemental foods to infants and children up to the age of 5 y
who are at nutrition risk or living in household with income
#185% of the federal poverty income guidelines (25). Subjects
who received WIC in the past 12 mo of the survey were con-
sidered to be WIC participants. We restricted our analysis of
WIC participation to participants aged 2–5 y who were living in
households with a PIR #1.85 (n = 6151). Participants in the
NSLP/SBP included children who participated in the NSLP,
SBP, or both. Our analyses of the NSLP/SBP were conducted in
participants aged 5–18 y because the NSLP/SBP provide as-
sistance to children and adolescents in school who were living in
households with income #185% of the PIR (n = 18,398) (26,
27). Students who received either full meals, reduced-price
meals, or both were considered to be NSLP/SBP participants.
HEI-2010
We calculated the HEI-2010 for all cycles of the continuous
NHANES with the use of the methods recommended by the
USDA and the National Cancer Institute on the basis of individual
food- and nutrient-intake data (28). The HEI quantitatively as-
sesses an individual’s adherence to the federal Dietary Guide-
lines for Americans. The HEI-2010 is the updated measuring
index that is based on the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans. The HEI-2010 consists of 12 components including 9 ad-
equacy components (total fruit; whole fruit; total vegetables;
greens and beans; whole grains; dairy; total protein foods; sea-
food and plant proteins; and fatty acids), for which higher scores
reflecting higher intakes, and 3 moderation components (refined
grains, sodium, and empty calories) for which higher scores
reflected lower intakes. Empty calories refers to calories from
solid fats, added sugars, and alcohol (6). In HEI-2010 compo-
nents, 6 components including total fruit, whole fruit, total veg-
etables, greens and beans, total protein foods, and seafood and
plant proteins were scored from 0 to 5; 5 components including
whole grains, dairy, fatty acids, refined grains, and sodium were
scored from 0 to 10; and empty calories were scored 0–20. The
total HEI was scored from 0 to 100. For adequacy components,
higher scores indicated higher intakes (Supplemental Table 1).

through 2012, HEI-2010 score increased from 42.5 (95% CI: 41.2, 43.8) to
50.9 (95% CI: 50.0, 51.8) with a significant time trend (P-trend , 0.001).

 Statistical analysis
We incorporated the NHANES complex survey design weights
into our calculations to permit inference to a nationally repre-
sentative population. A multivariable linear regression analysis was
used to investigate associations between independent and depen-
dent variables. To quantify the time trend, we used the midpoint of
each cycle as a scored variable and modeled it continuously. In
addition to the linear time trend, we also investigated the nonlinear
time trend in the HEI-2010 score by further adding a quadratic term
in the model. All models were adjusted for sex, age, total energy
intake, race/ethnicity, PIR, household size, and reference person’s
education level and marital status. When we examined the asso-
ciations of the WIC and NSLP with the HEI-2010, we also further
adjusted for SNAP participation. We further added a product term
of the time and variable of stratification into the linear regression
model to test the significance of this interaction.
RESULTS
From 1999 through 2012, the mean HEI-2010 score increased
from 42.5 (95% CI: 41.2, 43.8) to 50.9 (95% CI: 50.0, 51.8) with
a significant time trend (Figure 1). The HEI-2010 component
score increased by 1.1 points for whole grains; 0.9 points for
dairy; 0.8 points for whole fruit; 0.6 points for total fruit; 0.5
points for seafood and plant proteins, greens and beans, and fatty
acids; 0.4 points for total protein foods (all P-linear trend , 0.001);
and 0.2 points for refined grains (P-linear trend = 0.01). An
increase of 3.8 points in the component score for empty calories,
which indicated decreased consumption, contributed one-third
of the overall improvement (P-linear trend , 0.001). However,
the score for sodium intake decreased by 0.2 points, which in-
dicated increased consumption of sodium (P-trend , 0.001).
Total vegetable intake did not show a significant improvement
over the period (Figure 2, Supplemental Table 2). Time trends

foods, seafood and plant proteins, and fatty acids, higher scores corresponded to higher intakes. For refined grains, sodium, and empty calories, higher scores
corresponded to lower intakes. The HEI-2010 component score increased by 3.8 points for empty calories; 1.1 points for whole grains; 0.9 points for dairy;
0.8 points for whole fruit; 0.6 points for total fruit; 0.5 points for seafood and plant proteins, greens and beans, and fatty acids; 0.4 points for total protein foods

 in component HEI-2010 scores were generally similar across
different age groups (Supplemental Figure 2).
Table 2 shows the significant improvements in the HEI-2010
in all subgroups. Over follow-up, younger participants had
higher HEI-2010 scores compared with those of older partici-
pants. In race/ethnicity groups, Mexican American participants
had the highest HEI-2010 score, whereas non-Hispanic black
participants had the lowest HEI-2010 score. From 1999 to 2012,
the difference in the HEI-2010 between non-Hispanic blacks
and non-Hispanic whites decreased from 2.5 to 1.8 points. Al-
though participants in higher PIR categories did not have
a consistently higher HEI-2010 over the 14-y period, subjects
with a PIR .3.5 showed a greater improvement over time in the
HEI-2010 than was shown in the other 2 income categories
(percentage of change: PIR #1.3, 18.2%; PIR between 1.31 and
3.50, 19.2%; and PIR .3.50, 23.8%; P-quadratic trend = 0.01).
Trends in dietary quality were similar across different body
weights although participants with healthier body weights ap-
peared to have a higher HEI-2010 score at most NHANES cycles.
Although dietary quality did not differ significantly between
SNAP participants and nonparticipants in the combined analysis
(Figure 3), we observed a tendency toward a lower HEI-2010 in
SNAP participants than in nonparticipants after the 2003–2004
cycle (Table 2) within the SNAP eligible population. In general,
participants in the WIC appeared to have a higher HEI-2010
than that of nonparticipants. When 7 cycles were combined
together, the difference between WIC participants and non-
participants was significant (Table 2, Figure 3). In contrast,
participants in the NSLP/SBP had a lower HEI-2010 score
compared with that of nonparticipants in the combined analysis
(Figure 3). During the 2007–2008 cycle, the HEI-2010 score
appeared to drop in minority lower-income children but not in
higher-income children within the otherwise increasing trend.
DISCUSSION
Overall dietary quality in children and adolescents in the
United States improved steadily from 1999 to 2012. Multiple
factors, including increased intakes of whole grains, dairy, whole
fruit, total fruit, seafood and plant proteins, greens and beans, and
total protein foods, an increased ratio of unsaturated to saturated
fat, and decreased consumption of refined grains and empty
calories, contributed to this improvement. In the HEI-2010
components, a reduction in empty calories contributed approx-
imately one-third of the overall improvement. However, current
dietary quality in children and adolescents remains below opti-
mal. Gaps in dietary quality across different socioeconomic
groups persisted over time. Dietary quality also varied between
participants and nonparticipants of 3 federal nutrition assistance
programs.
Consistent with a previous report on the consumption of solid
fats and added sugars, we showed a significant improvement in
the HEI-2010 component score of empty calorie intake, which
reflected a decreasing trend in consumption (29). However, mean
intake of empty calories was still higher than the upper limit in
the HEI-2010 at 19% of total energy intake. Multiple factors
could have played significant roles in decreasing intake of empty
calories. First, nutrition education programs and public dialogues
have heightened awareness of health risks from excess intakes of
unhealthy fats and sugary beverages (30). Second, policy changes
at the state level, such as restrictions on ingredients and portions
of sugar-sweetened beverages at school, have also contributed to
this improvement (31–33). In contrast, the HEI-2010 score for
sodium intake worsened over time, which indicated increased
consumption. Increased consumption of snacks, which are
a major source of sodium for children and adolescents, could
have been responsible for this increase in sodium intake (34).
Total vegetable intake showed a slight (albeit NS) decrease
despite the consistent emphasis on vegetable consumption in
various dietary guidelines (35). There were moderate improve-
ments in the remaining HEI-2010 components. However, most
of these subscores remained at ,50% of their optimal score, and
overall dietary quality remains poor.
Our findings suggest that disparities in dietary quality have
persisted across sociodemographic groups. Children ,6 y of age
generally had better dietary quality than that of older children.
Potential explanations include the likelihood that children who
were under school age had fewer opportunities to eat away from
home where foods are more processed and less nutritious. In
race/ethnicity groups, non-Hispanic black children and adoles-
cents showed poorest dietary quality, whereas Mexican Ameri-
cans had better dietary quality than did other groups. The greater
prevalence of low socioeconomic status in non-Hispanic blacks
could have limited their access to healthy food retailers and
nutrition knowledge (36). Previous studies in adults from the
NHANES have reported similar disparities across race/ethnicity
groups, thereby suggesting that differences between non-
Hispanic white and Mexican American children may be due to
cultural differences in food preferences and eating behaviors,
whereas differences between non-Hispanic white and non-
Hispanic black children are likely attributable to socioeconomic
inequity (37). Children and adolescents with higher BMI
showed nonsignificantly lower dietary quality. Despite a dra-
matic decrease in empty calories and a small improvement in
physical activity levels in the past decade (38), the obesity and
overweight prevalence did not decline significantly (39). Our
findings provide support that the improvement of overall dietary
quality could play a more powerful role than would simply re-
ducing total energy intake in achieving a healthy body weight
(40). The association between lower socioeconomic status and
poorer dietary quality has been reported previously. The un-
derlying mechanism for this relation is multilayered. First,
lower-income households may be less likely to buy healthier
foods that generally have higher prices (41). Second, underserved
communities often have limited access to healthy foods (42).
Last, a lack of nutrition knowledge is more common in people of
lower socioeconomic status with a generally lower education
level (43).
We observed lower dietary quality in SNAP participants.
Similar to our findings in children and adolescents, previous
studies have also related SNAP participation to low dietary
quality, adiposity, and metabolic risk factors in the adult pop-
ulation (16). The SNAP aims to relieve the hunger burden in the
United States by providing benefits to people with low income to
purchase healthy foods. Although the SNAP includes nutrition
education to promote healthy eating in participants, SNAP
benefits may still be used to purchase unhealthy foods. For ex-
ample, one study reported that w$4 billion of SNAP benefits in
2011 were used to purchase soft drinks (44). A program that
solely relies on personal responsibility in making informed

2 Midpoint of each survey cycle was used as the time-trend variable in the linear regression model. P values were calculated with the use of Wald’s test on the time variable.
3 Product term of the time and variable of stratification was added into the linear regression model for calculating the P-interaction.
4 Quadratic term of the time variable was added into the linear regression model to test the nonlinear trend. P values were calculated with the use of Wald’s test on the quadratic term.
5 Linear regression model was adjusted for sex, age, total energy intake, race/ethnicity, PIR, household size, and reference person’s education level and marriage status except for the variable of stratification.
6 Linear regression model was adjusted for sex, age, total energy intake, race/ethnicity, PIR, household size, and reference person’s education level and marriage status. For analyses of the WIC and school
meal, the model was further adjusted for the participation in the SNAP.
7 Values were calculated in participants with a PIR #1.3 (n = 15,587).
8 Values were calculated in participants aged #5 y with a PIR #1.85 (n = 6151).

DIETARY QUALITY IN US CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS

 choices may be insufficient to result in substantial dietary be-
havior changes and, therefore, to address disparities in nutrition.
Although the Healthy Incentives Pilot Program showed that fi-
nancial incentives were associated with higher total spending
on fruit and vegetables, the sustainability of such programs is
questionable because of the high cost (45). Instead, collective
actions, such as taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages and the
improved availability of affordable healthy foods, should be
priorities in future nutrition policy.
We also observed lower dietary quality in NSLP/SBP par-
ticipants than in nonparticipants. Although recent legislative
changes have required that school meals must meet federal
nutrition requirements, snacks and dinners that students eat
outside school cannot be controlled. Children and adolescents
from low-income families appeared to be particularly vulnerable
to the lack of healthy food outside of school (26). The voluntary
participation in nutrition assistance programs may be associated
with a parents’ lack of meal-preparation abilities or motivation.
Previous studies have also shown that participation in school
meal programs was associated with low family income (46). The
restricted analysis and statistical adjustment for socioeconomic
status that were done in the current analysis reduced the like-
lihood that the observed difference in dietary quality between
participants and nonparticipants of the NSLP/SBP was due to
differences in socioeconomic status, but residual confounding
may have existed. Our finding that higher dietary quality in WIC
participants, especially the significantly higher HEI-2010 score
in the 2011–2012 cycle, is consistent with a previous study (47)
that reported that healthier dietary intake was related to the
addition of more-nutritious foods in the WIC food-package re-
vision in 2009.
There were some limitations in our study. The 24-h dietary
recall relied on short-term memory; although this aspect may not
well represent an individual’s usual diet, it can provide accurate
population means (48). Since 2002, an additional day of 24-h
recall was obtained via telephone on the basis of evidence that
telephone-administered 24-h dietary recalls can provide similar
estimates of nutrient intake as are provided by in-person in-
terviews (49). The methods of food grouping and coding
changed in updates of nutrition databases. However, we do not
believe that these changes influenced our measure of the HEI
particularly because we showed a linear, rather than abrupt,
change in dietary quality over time. It is also possible that, with
increased media attention of healthy eating in children, there
may have been some reporting bias over time. Finally, direct
causal effects of socioeconomic factors or of food programs on
dietary quality could not be shown because of the cross-sectional
nature of the NHANES study design.
In conclusion, we show that the overall dietary quality in
children and adolescents in the United States has improved
modestly from 1999 to 2012 but remains far below optimal.
Multiple HEI-2010 components contribute to this improvement.
There are clear disparities in dietary quality across socioeconomic

 groups. Although federal nutrition assistance programs such as the
SNAP, NSLP, and WIC remain important, our results suggest that
additional inputs are needed including improved access to and
education about healthy choices to address disparities in dietary
quality in children and adolescents. Initiatives that focus on
changing the food environment through collective action, such as
taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages, may also be effective in
enhancing the current momentum of dietary quality improvement
and addressing disparities in dietary quality across different
socioeconomic groups (50).
