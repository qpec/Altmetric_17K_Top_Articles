IMPORTANCE In an effort to regulate physician conflicts of interest, some US academic
medical centers (AMCs) enacted policies restricting pharmaceutical representative sales visits
to physicians (known as detailing) between 2006 and 2012. Little is known about the effect
of these policies on physician prescribing.
OBJECTIVE To analyze the association between detailing policies enacted at AMCs and
physician prescribing of actively detailed and not detailed drugs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study used a difference-in-differences multivariable
regression analysis to compare changes in prescribing by physicians before and after
implementation of detailing policies at AMCs in 5 states (California, Illinois, Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, and New York) that made up the intervention group with changes in
prescribing by a matched control group of similar physicians not subject to a detailing policy.
EXPOSURES Academic medical center implementation of policies regulating pharmaceutical
salesperson visits to attending physicians.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The monthly within-drug class market share of
prescriptions written by an individual physician for detailed and nondetailed drugs in 8 drug
classes (lipid-lowering drugs, gastroesophageal reflux disease drugs, diabetes drugs,
antihypertensive drugs, hypnotic drugs approved for the treatment of insomnia [sleep aids],
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drugs, antidepressant drugs, and antipsychotic
drugs) comparing the 10- to 36-month period before implementation of the detailing policies
with the 12- to 36-month period after implementation, depending on data availability.
RESULTS The analysis included 16 121 483 prescriptions written between January 2006 and
June 2012 by 2126 attending physicians at the 19 intervention group AMCs and by 24 593
matched control group physicians. The sample mean market share at the physician-drug-month
level for detailed and nondetailed drugs prior to enactment of policies was 19.3% and 14.2%,
respectively. Exposure to an AMC detailing policy was associated with a decrease in the market
share of detailed drugs of 1.67 percentage points (95% CI, −2.18 to −1.18 percentage points;
P < .001) and an increase in the market share of nondetailed drugs of 0.84 percentage points
(95% CI, 0.54 to 1.14 percentage points; P < .001). Associations were statistically significant for
6 of 8 study drug classes for detailed drugs (lipid-lowering drugs, gastroesophageal reflux
disease drugs, antihypertensive drugs, sleep aids, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
drugs, and antidepressant drugs) and for 9 of the 19 AMCs that implemented policies.
Eleven of the 19 AMCs regulated salesperson gifts to physicians, restricted salesperson
access to facilities, and incorporated explicit enforcement mechanisms. For 8 of these
11 AMCs, there was a significant change in prescribing. In contrast, there was a significant
change at only 1 of 8 AMCs that did not enact policies in all 3 areas.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Implementation of policies at AMCs that restricted
pharmaceutical detailing between 2006 and 2012 was associated with modest but significant
reductions in prescribing of detailed drugs across 6 of 8 major drug classes; however, changes
were not seen in all of the AMCs that enacted policies.

B
etween 2006 and 2012, a number of academic medi-
cal centers enacted policies restricting sales visits from
pharmaceutical representatives to their practicing phy-
sicians (known as detailing), by far the most common form of
interaction between physicians and the pharmaceutical
industry.1 Between the same dates, the number of academic
medical centers receiving A or B grades from the American
Medical Student Association’
s conflict of interest scorecard
(which evaluates the strictness and comprehensiveness of aca-
demic medical center policies dealing with physician interac-
tions with pharmaceutical and medical device companies and
assigns each academic medical center a letter grade) in-
creased from 22 to 91, and the number receiving an F grade or
incomplete grade declined from 100 to 26.2
Two studies have examined the relationship between
academic medical center detailing policies and antipsychotic
prescribing. In the first study,3 enactment of an academic
medical center detailing policy was associated with a re-
duction in off-label prescribing of detailed drugs by ped-
iatricians. In the second study,4 there was no association
between academic medical center policies and prescribing of
antipsychotics by psychiatrists. Both studies focused on a
single physician specialty and a single drug class. In a third
study,5 private practice physicians who did not routinely see
pharmaceutical sales representatives were slower to change
their prescribing after the release of new positive or negative
information on 3 specific drugs; however, the study did not
distinguish between physicians who chose not to receive
sales visits and those who were not visited due to policies at
their medical practice.
To our knowledge, no large-scale study has evaluated the
association between academic medical center detailing
policies and changes in prescribing, despite the large clinical
and economic importance of the topic. The objective of this
study was to examine the association between detailing
policy enactment and prescribing behavior by (1) including
prescribing data of physicians in all specialties (including
generalists), (2) examining drugs in multiple drug classes
containing a mix of actively detailed and generic drugs, and
(3) estimating changes in prescribing after policy enactment
across all academic medical centers in multiple states com-
pared with a matched control group of physicians not subject
to similar policies.
Methods
Study Design
The study received institutional review board approval with
a waiver on informed consent from Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity. The data contained no patient-identifying information.
The study used a difference-in-differences multivariable
regression design to compare changes in the prescribing
behavior of physicians at academic medical centers that
implemented new detailing policies between January 2006
and June 2012 (the intervention group) with changes in the
prescribing behavior of a matched control group of physi-
cians not subject to such policies. The analysis compared the
change in prescribing behavior of intervention group physi-
cians before and after their affiliated academic medical cen-
ter’
s policy went into effect with the change in prescribing
behavior of matched control physicians at the same points in
time. Difference-in-differences models are commonly used
to examine large-scale policy changes when randomized
clinical trials are infeasible.6
Data
The analysis focused on US academic medical centers in the 5
states (California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and
New York) with the largest number of academically affiliated
physicians. These 5 states have 20.8% of all US academic
medical centers7 and represented nearly 35% of all prescrip-
tions written in the United States in 2015.8 The study period
of January 2006 to June 2012 was selected because a large
number of academic medical centers changed policies during
this time frame.
Information about the content of each academic medical
center’
s policy was coded based on telephone and in-person
interviews conducted from 2012 to 2013 with administrators
at29ofthe33academicmedicalcentersinthe5states.Intotal,
9 of 29 interviews were conducted in person. For the 4 aca-
demic medical centers that did not respond to interview re-
quests, coding was based on policy databases at the Institute
on Medicine as a Profession9 and the American Medical Stu-
dent Association.2
The detailing policy of each academic medical center was
compared with the code of conduct10 established in 2002 by
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
(PhRMA), which placed some voluntary limits on detailing for
allitscorporatemembers.Theselimitsbannedallpersonalgifts

Key Points
Question How did physician prescribing behavior change after US
academic medical centers implemented policies that limited
pharmaceutical salesperson detailing?
Findings Using a difference-in-differences design, the study
compared changes in the prescribing behavior of 2126 physicians
at 19 academic medical centers during the periods before and after
enactment of detailing policies with changes in the prescribing
behavior of 24 593 matched control physicians during the same
period for 262 drugs in 8 drug classes. Policy enactment was
associated with a 1.67 percentage point decrease in the market
share of detailed drugs and a 0.84 percentage point increase in
the market share of nondetailed drugs. Both estimates were
statistically significant in the full sample, but were only statistically
significant for 9 of the 19 individual academic medical centers.
Meaning Academic medical center policies to regulate detailing
were associated with modest but significant changes in
prescribing behavior for some but not all of the centers that
enacted policies.

continued to allow meals and educational gifts. These poli-
cies applied nationwide to all sales visits, and therefore pro-
vided a baseline set of regulations for the study.
Of the 33 academic medical centers, 9 enacted policies
stricter than the PhRMA code of conduct before the start of
the study period and were excluded from the analysis be-
cause the study design required adequate data from both be-
fore and after the intervention. Of the remaining 24 aca-
demic medical centers, 20 implemented policies during the
study period that were stricter than the PhRMA code of con-
duct. Specific regulations for these academic medical centers
were coded in 3 areas: (1) salesperson gifts to physicians,
(2) salesperson access to academic medical center facilities,
and (3) mechanisms for enforcement of the policies.
The market research firm IMS provided data based on
quarterly surveys of the physicians affiliated with each indi-
vidual hospital within these 20 academic medical centers.
The hospitals covered by each academic medical center
policy are listed in eTable 1 in the Supplement. The study
included all intervention group physicians who were full-
time attending physicians at an academic medical center hos-
pital for at least 1 quarter during the study period, and who
wrote at least 50 prescriptions that were processed by CVS
Caremark, a major pharmacy benefits manager. A physician
who was reported by the IMS survey as having left the aca-
demic medical center was dropped from the intervention
group beginning at that point in time.
Physicians who likely wrote prescriptions in environ-
ments outside the academic medical center, such as part-
time attending physicians or other physicians who merely
had admitting privileges at an academic medical center hos-
pital, were excluded from the intervention group because the
policies would not apply to them for prescriptions written in
their main practice outside the academic medical center hos-
pital. One academic medical center (Stony Brook University
Medical Center) was excluded from the analysis because
there were too few physicians (<25 full-time attending physi-
cians during the study period according to the IMS data) to
conduct reliable statistical testing, leaving the intervention
group with 19 academic medical centers.
Data at the individual drug level regarding national sales
force size for specific drugs were provided by the market re-
search firm SDI Health. Drug classes were selected based on 2
criteriachosenbytheresearcherstoensurethatthedrugclasses
in the study had a mix of highly detailed drugs and at least 1
widelyprescribednondetaileddrug.First,theoveralldrugclass
wasrequiredtohaveatleast2000salespeopleduringthestudy
period. Second, the detailed drugs within the drug class were
requiredtohaveatleast25%butnotmorethan75%ofthetotal
market share during the study period.
The 8 drug classes meeting these criteria were lipid-
lowering drugs, gastroesophageal reflux disease drugs,
diabetes drugs, antihypertensive drugs, attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder drugs, antidepressant drugs, antipsy-
chotic drugs, and hypnotic drugs approved for the treatment of
insomnia(referredtoassleepaids).Alldrugswithinthese8drug
classesthathadawithin-drugclassmarketshareofatleast0.5%
were included.
All 262 drugs included in the study appear in eTable 2 in
the Supplement. The number of drugs in the database was
not static during the study period because the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved a number of new drugs
between 2006 and 2012. Of the included drugs, 87 were
detailed at some point during the study, although many of
them were detailed for only part of the study period. Fifty
drugs were detailed during the entire study period. Twenty-
five generic drugs were approved during the study period in
which the bioequivalent brand-name drug in question had
never previously faced generic competition. Twelve brand-
name drugs were newly approved by the FDA during the
study period.
Among the 175 drugs never detailed during the study, 114
were generic drugs, meaning they did not have a brand name
and were only referred to by their chemical name. The remain-
ing 61 were brand-name drugs that were not detailed during
thestudyperiod.Genericandbioequivalentbrand-namedrugs
were treated as separate in the analysis.
The pharmacy benefits manager provided a database
of potential control physicians whose prescriptions were
filled in the 5 states in the study, and data on all prescrip-
tions filled through its pharmacy benefits system. The
resulting database contained more than 250 000 potential
control physicians.
A strict matching protocol was used to create a control
group of physicians who were similar to intervention group
physicians in terms of background and prescribing habits.
Intervention group physicians were matched to potential
control physicians in the same metropolitan statistical area
based on pharmacy location for the majority of each physi-
cian’
s prescriptions. Control physicians also had to exactly
match an intervention physician’
s specialty and year of birth,
which were identified using the American Medical Associa-
tion Masterfile.
To ensure that matched physicians had similar prescrib-
ing habits, a control physician was required to be within 10%
of the intervention group physician’
s prescribing volume for
all 8 of the drug classes within the first 6 months of the study
period (before any of the academic medical centers had en-
acted policies). We included all physicians outside the 19 in-
tervention academic medical centers who met these criteria
as matched controls, which led to an overall ratio of control
to intervention physicians of 11.7 to 1.
Statistical Analysis
The dependent variable in the statistical analysis was a phy-
sician’
s market share during a given month for a given drug
within a drug class. For example, if a physician prescribed
drug A 5 times, drug B 10 times, drug C 15 times, drug D
20 times, and drug E 0 times within a month, the physician
wrote 50 total prescriptions within that drug class and had a
marketshareof10%fordrugA,20%fordrugB,30%fordrugC,
40% for drug D, and 0% for drug E. The sum of each physi-
cian’
s market share within a drug class and within a month was
100%.Drugsthataphysicianneverprescribedduringthestudy
period were not included in the data for that physician. Within
a given drug class, a physician was only included if that

physicianprescribeddrugswithinthatdrugclassatsomepoint
during the study period. Market share is frequently used as a
dependent variable in studies on physician prescribing, espe-
cially when data on all drugs within a drug class are included.11
The regression approach modeled the change in prescrib-
ing after enactment of an academic medical center policy by
calculating a regression coefficient that estimated the post-
intervention between-group difference in prescribing com-
paredwiththepreinterventionbetween-groupdifference.This
coefficient was calculated separately for drugs detailed and
those not detailed because policies regulating detailing might
affect these 2 drug categories in opposite ways, reducing the
likelihood a physician would prescribe a detailed drug for a pa-
tient, and increasing the likelihood a physician would in-
stead prescribe a nondetailed drug.
Thestudydistinguishedbetweenthese2categoriesbyusing
2 indicator variables. The first variable took a value of 1 if a drug
wasdetailedwithinagivenmonth,andthesecondvariabletook
a value of 1 if the drug was not detailed within that month. For
each drug within each month, exactly 1 of these indicators took
a value of 1. These indicator variables were then each inter-
acted with an indicator variable that designated whether the
physician was in the intervention group, and an indicator vari-
able that took a value of 1 for all periods after which a specific
academic medical center had adopted its policy.
To focus on the changes in prescribing related to the in-
tervention, the sample was limited to prescriptions written up
to 3 years before and 3 years after each academic medical cen-
ter’
s policy intervention, with the preintervention data trun-
cated for the centers that implemented their policy less than
3 years after the beginning of the study period and the post-
intervention period truncated for the centers that imple-
mented their intervention less than 3 years before the end date
of the study period.
Fixed effects were included in the regression analyses for
individual physicians, months, and drugs. The fixed effects
controlled for baseline differences in prescribing behavior
across physicians, hospitals, geographies, drugs, and drug
classes. The inclusion of physician fixed effects meant that any
difference across physicians that did not vary over time did not
affect the regression coefficients, even if these differences
caused dissimilar prescribing behavior, because each indi-
vidual physician was compared only with himself or herself
before and after intervention.12 This is a conservative estima-
tion strategy because observing an association between imple-
mentation of the policies and changes in prescribing required
individual physicians to change their prescribing propensity
after the policy was implemented. Similarly, the use of drug
fixed effects limited the regression estimates to within-drug
changes in market share following policy implementation.
Month fixed effects accounted for time trends, and an inter-
action between each month fixed effect and the control group
indicator variable allowed time trends to differ for the con-
trol and intervention groups.
Difference-in-differences models can produce spurious
findings if an unobserved and unexpected event that af-
fected only 1 group (eg, a news story about conflicts of inter-
est at a particular academic medical center) occurred shortly
before or after the intervention, or if the 2 groups being com-
pared had different time trends before the intervention
occurred.13 Two additional analyses were conducted to exam-
ine the exact timing of prescribing changes identified in the
regression analyses to rule out these problems.
First, raw data plots were generated to show changes in
the actual data across time. Because academic medical cen-
ters enacted policies at different points in time, the data for
each academic medical center and its matched control group
were centered on the date that the academic medical center
implemented the policy. This meant that the raw data were
analyzed not according to calendar months, but according
to months before or months after the intervention, a variable
termed months to intervention. For example, data from
November 2007 for an academic medical center that enacted
policies in December 2007 were paired with data from June
2007foradifferentacademicmedicalcenterthatenactedpoli-
cies in July 2007 because in both cases the data were from the
month before intervention.
The market share data used in the raw data plots were
calculated at the academic medical center level, not at the
physician level, so that each academic medical center and
control group pair had a single observation for each month
before the intervention. This avoided the overweighting of
data for any particular period so that time trends could be
accurately assessed. One version of the raw data plot con-
tained data on all drugs in the database. However, generic
equivalents of 25 proprietary study drugs were introduced
for the first time during the study period according to the
FDA Orange Book data files.14
The sudden introduction of generic drugs and the phar-
macy benefit manager’
s policy of mandated generic inter-
change caused a decline in the market share of detailed drugs
at the time of such generic entry, which made plots of time
trends more difficult to interpret. A second version of the raw
data plot therefore excluded brand-name drugs that faced ini-
tial bioequivalent generic entry during the study period, and
theircorrespondinggenericequivalents.Specifically,ifthefirst
time a generic version of a proprietary drug as listed in the FDA
Orange Book occurred during the study period, both the pro-
prietary and generic equivalent drug were dropped for the
plot’
ssecondversion.Allofthedetailedandnondetaileddrugs
included in this second plot, therefore, were actively pre-
scribed throughout the study interval.
A second regression-based investigation of the timing
of the changes in prescribing associated with the interven-
tion was conducted. Instead of a single regression coefficient
for the entire postintervention period, as in the main regres-
sionmodel,thisregressionmodelestimatedaseriesofmonthly
regression coefficients (capturing the interactions between the
months to intervention variables and the intervention group
and postintervention variables) for each month within a 12-
month window both before and after policy implementation.
The regression provided a coefficient for each month before
the intervention, representing the estimated between-group
difference compared with the estimated difference in the
month before intervention, which was the omitted month in
the regression.

Ordinary least squares was used to estimate the regres-
sions due to the ease of interpreting the coefficients. Obser-
vations were weighted by a physician’
s total number of pre-
scriptions within a given drug class within a given month.
Standard errors were clustered at the physician level and were
block bootstrapped with 1000 iterations.
Alternative versions of the regression model were esti-
mated to assess the robustness of the model. These included
(1)estimatingtheassociationsbetweentheinterventionandpre-
scribing for generalists and specialists separately, (2) using the
number of prescriptions rather than the market share
asadependentvariableforagivenphysician,drug,andmonth,
(3) limiting each intervention physician to his or her closest 5
control matches rather than all matches that met the matching
criteria, (4) using a nonlinear maximum likelihood specifica-
tion (the fractional logit) rather than ordinary least squares to
estimate the regressions, and (5) conducting a series of 27 re-
gressionsinwhichallobservationsfromasingleacademicmedi-
cal center or drug class were omitted to ensure that no single
academic medical center or drug class was driving the results.
Testing was done at the 95% significance level using 2-sided
tests. Stata version 14 (StataCorp) was used for all analyses.
Results
The analysis included 16 121 483 prescriptions written by 2126
attending physicians at the 19 intervention group academic
medical centers between January 2006 and June 2012 and by
the 24 593 matched control group physicians. Most interven-
tion and control physicians only prescribed within a limited
number of the study’
s 8 drug classes.

period, usually several years after the initial policy.
bProhibitions on gifts that were stricter than the Pharmaceutical Research

dPenalized salespeople, physicians, or both for noncompliance.
e The maximum value of this variable is 72 months because the study was
limited to 3 years before and 3 years after each AMC’
s policy intervention.
Because the data start in January 2006 and the end in June 2012,
the effective maximum for most AMCs is less than 72 months.

The number of intervention physicians ranged from 34 to
285 across academic medical centers, and the number of con-
trol physicians they were matched to ranged from 241 to 4724
(Table 1). The policies enacted between October 2006 and May
2011atthe19interventiongroupacademicmedicalcentersdif-
fered in their focus, but all included limits or bans on pharma-
ceutical representatives providing meals, branded items, and
educational gifts that went further than the PhRMA code of
conduct. Seventeen academic medical centers placed limits on
hospitalaccesssuchasbansonsalespeopleinpatientcareareas
or requiring salesperson registration and training. The poli-
cies for 11 academic medical centers contained penalties for
salespeople, physicians, or both for noncompliance.
The introduction of academic medical center policies
was not uniform across the study period (Figure 1). Specifi-
cally, 9 of 19 intervention academic medical centers, repre-
senting 53% of intervention physicians, introduced policies
during the 9 months between June 2007 and February
2008. Several widely prescribed brand-name drugs faced
initial generic competition during the months just around
this period, most notably the brand-name version of the
sleep aid zolpidem, whose generic equivalent was intro-
duced in April 2007 (Figure 1).
At the physician level, the intervention group had a
greater percentage of specialists than the control group
(74.6% vs 54.0%, respectively) because intervention group
specialists matched to many more control physicians in the
pharmacy benefit manager’
s database, according to the pre-
determined matching criteria (Table 2). The number of
prescriptions written by control physicians was greater than
those written by intervention physicians (mean prescrip-
tions, 609.73 vs 530.36, respectively; median prescriptions,
401 vs 312). Within the combination unit of observation for
physician, drug, and month used in the regression analyses,
control physicians prescribed a larger number of drugs per
month during the preintervention period and a higher pro-
portion of detailed drugs.
The analysis of the data that includes all 262 study drugs
appears in Figure 2A. The levels of market share and time
trends for detailed drugs were similar for the intervention
and control groups during the preintervention period. After
the intervention period, trends diverged between the 2
groups. The analysis of the data that excluded brand-name
drugs that faced initial generic entry during the study period,
and their generic equivalents, appears in Figure 2B. With
these drugs removed, the preintervention trend against

prescribing of detailed drugs is diminished for both groups.
The preintervention trends are again similar in both the inter-
vention and control groups, and there is a postintervention
divergence in trends. The differences between the preinter-
vention trends indicate that the initial generic entry affected
the slopes of the time trends; however, both plots in Figure 2
show a postintervention divergence between the 2 groups in
the prescribing of detailed drugs.
Implementation of academic medical center policies was
associated with a mean decrease in market share of detailed
drugs of 1.67 percentage points (95% CI, −2.18 to −1.18 per-
centage points; P < .001) and an increase in the market share

Months to intervention refers to the number of months relative to each
academic medical center’
s intervention. Data for each academic medical center
is centered by the date of its intervention. Each data point represents the mean
market share for detailed drugs across the 8 drug classes. For each academic
medical center, the mean market share of detailed drugs in a given month to
intervention was calculated separately for all 8 drug classes. This calculation
yielded a total of 152 drug class mean market share values. Lines represent best
linear fit, and both intercepts and slopes were allowed to vary before and after
the intervention at each academic medical center. The market shares were
calculated at the academic medical center level, not the individual physician
level (which is the level of observation for the regressions). The mean market
shares are not directly comparable with the sample means reported in Table 3.
Eighteen academic medical centers are represented in every month to the
intervention. A ± 12-month window was selected because pre- and
postintervention data were available in that window for all but 1 academic
medical center. One academic medical center, Stanford University, and its
control group are not present in months to the intervention between -10 and -12
because this represented the last 3 months of 2005, which was before the
study period.
a Data are from all study drugs.
bData from 25 proprietary drugs that faced initial generic entry during the study
period, and their corresponding generic equivalents, were removed from this
analysis. The remaining 212 drugs were composed of 123 brand-name drugs
that did not face initial generic entry during the study period, and 89 generic
drugs that were introduced before the study period.

of nondetailed drugs by 0.84 percentage points (95% CI, 0.54
to 1.14 percentage points; P < .001) (Table 3). Of the 19 aca-
demic medical centers, results were statistically significant for
9 academic medical centers for detailed drugs and for 8 aca-
demic medical centers for nondetailed drugs.
Of the 11 academic medical centers with policies
that limited salesperson gifts to physicians, regulated sales-
person access to facilities, and provided enforcement
mechanisms such as penalties for salespeople and physi-
cians who violated the policy, there were significant re-
sults at 8 (University of California, Los Angeles; Boston
University; University of Illinois, Chicago; University of
Southern California; University of Pittsburgh; University
of Massachusetts; State University of New York, Downstate;
and Tufts University) and nonsignificant results at 3
(Rush Medical College, New York Medical Center, and Uni-
versity of Rochester). In contrast, there was a significant
change at only 1 of 8 academic medical centers (University of
California, San Diego) that failed to enact 1 or more of these
policies and nonsignificant results at 7 (Stanford University;
Northwestern University; University of California, Davis;
University of California, San Francisco; Mount Sinai; Temple
University; and Thomas Jefferson University).
At the drug class level, detailing policies were associated
with statistically significant changes in market share for 6 of
the 8 drug classes (Table 3). Sleep aid drugs, drugs for gastro-
esophageal reflux disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactiv-
ity disorder drugs all showed decreases of greater than 5 per-
centagepointsinmarketsharefordetaileddrugs.Marketshare
of detailed drugs for antidepressant agents, antihypertensive
drugs, and lipid-lowering drugs decreased by 0.84 to 2.32 per-
centage points. All of these results were statistically signifi-
cant. Coefficients for change in market share of nondetailed
attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorderdrugs,anddetailedand
nondetailed antipsychotic drugs and diabetes drugs, were not
statistically significant.

Figure 3 and in eTable 3 in the Supplement. The estimated
between-group difference was not statistically significant and
close to 0 for the preintervention months, but was positive and
statistically significant during all postintervention months.
In each of the 5 classes of alternative models intended to
test for the robustness of the results, the signs of coefficients
of interest were the same as those for the main model, and the
statistical significance of the results for both detailed and non-
detailed drugs remained at P < .001. The results of these tests
appear in eTable 4 in the Supplement.
Discussion
In this study comparing changes in the prescribing behavior
of 2126 physicians at 19 academic medical centers with the
prescribingbehaviorof24 593matchedcontrolphysiciansdur-
ing the 10- to 36-month period before vs the 12- to 36-month
period after implementation of detailing policies at academic
medical centers, enactment of detailing restrictions at aca-
demic medical centers was associated with a decrease in the
prescribingofdetaileddrugsof1.67percentagepointsofmarket
share, and an increase in prescribing of nondetailed drugs of
0.84 percentage points. Evaluated at a sample mean market
share of 19.3% for detailed drugs, the 1.67 percentage point re-
duction represented an 8.7% relative decrease in market share
after the intervention. At the 14.2% sample mean market
share for nondetailed drugs, the 0.84 percentage point in-
crease represented a 5.6% relative increase in market share fol-
lowing the intervention.
Due to mandated generic interchange, whereby the phar-
macy benefits manager automatically substituted generics
for brand-name drugs when generic equivalents were avail-
able and when allowed by state law, more than 95% of non-
detailedprescriptionsinthedatawereforgenericdrugs.There-
fore, across academic medical centers and drug classes,
prescriptions shifted away from detailed drugs and toward ge-
neric drugs following the introduction of policies restricting
pharmaceutical detailing.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the observational de-
signprecludesprovingcausalrelationshipsbecauseothersecu-
lar changes may have occurred that could have influenced the
study results. For instance, some academic medical centers
likely underwent other changes around the time that they en-
acteddetailingpolicies,suchasinitiatingacultureofevidence-
based practice or providing education and training around in-
dustry interactions. However, the results in Figure 3, showing
that the changes in prescribing started during the exact month

of policy enactment, support the hypothesis that enactment
ofthepolicieswasassociatedwithchangesinprescribing.Nev-
ertheless, it is not possible to rule out that the prescribing
changes observed in the study reflected other changes at aca-
demic medical centers that coincided with detailing policies.
Second, control group physicians were mainly in private
practice, whereas intervention group physicians were associ-
ated with academic medical centers. Even though the use of
fixed effects in the analysis controls for baseline physician
differences in prescribing behavior, it is possible that control
group physicians would have responded differently if ex-
posed to the policies than did intervention group physicians.
Third, the study used data sources for which accuracy has not
been validated or for which there are known accuracy issues
(ie, the American Medical Association Masterfile to code type
of physician specialty, the affiliation data provided by IMS,
and the detailing data provided by SDI Health). Fourth, re-
searcher judgment was used to determine the 8 drug classes
to include in the study. It is possible that examination of other
drug classes may have produced different results. Fifth, the
study period ended in 2012, and many academic medical cen-
ters have taken further measures since 2012 to limit conflicts
of interest, so it is unknown whether the findings would trans-
late to the current environment.
However, the study had several strengths that suggest that
the most likely explanation for the associations identified in
the results was that the policies influenced prescribing behav-
ior. The difference-in-differences design used in the study is
superior to the purely cross-sectional approaches used in sev-
eral other studies addressing the same question. This design
is commonly used to assess the effects of changes in policies
when, as is true of the implementation of detailing policies,
randomized clinical trials are impractical.
The study was also more comprehensive than previous
studies examining drug detailing and conflicts of interest.
The data set included all widely prescribed drugs within 8
major drug classes, prescribed by both generalist and spe-
cialist physicians. The academic medical centers in the
study encompassed a large number of physicians who were
exposed to the policies in the middle of an ongoing stream
of prescribing, and an even larger control group of physi-
cians matched on geography, age, specialty, and drug pre-
scribing prior to policy enactment.
Academic medical centers in the study implemented poli-
cies at different points in time, which helps to reduce con-
cern that unobserved events distinct from the policies can ac-
count for the results. Although implementation of the policies
was not associated with significant changes in prescribing for
all drug classes and academic medical centers, the aggregate
results were highly significant, and this was true even when
individualdrugclassesandacademicmedicalcentersweresuc-
cessively removed from the analysis.
Even though the overall results of the study demonstrated
a significant association between implementation of detailing
policiesandchangeinprescribingofdetaileddrugs,thefactthat
only9ofthe19academicmedicalcentersincludedinthestudy
had statistically significant results may suggest that the results
lack generalizability. However, as shown in Table 1, academic
medicalcenterdetailingpoliciesvariedwidely.Futureresearch
should examine the relationship between the content of aca-
demicmedicalcenterdetailingpoliciesandtheprescribingpat-
ternsofphysicians,especiallybecausesuchpoliciesareincreas-
ingly being adopted by private medical practices.
These results complement findings from other studies15-17
that have documented correlations between physician pre-
scribingofdetaileddrugsanddetailingstrategiessuchasmeals,
as well as 2 studies18,19 that reported that physicians who had
graduated from medical schools with strict conflict of inter-
est policies prescribed fewer marketed (detailed) medica-
tions. The current study provides new evidence relevant to the
evaluation of detailing policies by examining changes in the
prescribing of detailed and nondetailed drugs by physicians
who were and were not subject to detailing policies imple-
mented at academic medical centers.
The reduction in the prescribing of detailed drugs and the
increaseintheprescribingofnondetaileddrugspotentiallyrep-
resentsalargereductionincosts.In2010,pharmaceuticalcom-
panies earned more than $60 billion in revenues for detailed
drugs included in the study,20 and generic drugs are on aver-
age 80% to 85% less expensive than brand-name drugs.21 A
1-percentage point change in market share could represent ap-
proximately a 5% relative change in revenue for the average
detailed drug, suggesting that the observed changes in pre-
scribing could have important economic implications.
Conclusions
Implementation of policies at academic medical centers that
restricted pharmaceutical detailing between 2006 and 2012
was associated with modest but significant reductions in pre-
scribingofdetaileddrugsacross6of8majordrugclasses;how-
ever, changes were not seen in all of the academic medical cen-
ters that enacted policies.
