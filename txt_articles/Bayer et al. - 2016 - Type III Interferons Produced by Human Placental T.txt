In Brief
Bayer et al. find that primary human
placental trophoblasts are refractory to
ZIKV infection due to their constitutive
release of antiviral type III interferons,
which also serves to protect non-
placental cells. These data suggest that
rather than directly infecting the placenta,
ZIKV likely uses alternative strategies to
cross the placenta.

SUMMARY
During mammalian pregnancy, the placenta acts as a
barrier between the maternal and fetal compart-
ments. The recently observed association between
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during human pregnancy
and fetal microcephaly and other anomalies sug-
gests that ZIKV may bypass the placenta to reach
the fetus. This led us to investigate ZIKV infection
of primary human trophoblasts (PHTs), which are
the barrier cells of the placenta. We discovered that
PHT cells from full-term placentas are refractory to
ZIKV infection. In addition, medium from uninfected
PHT cells protects non-placental cells from ZIKV
infection. PHT cells constitutively release the type
III interferon (IFN) IFNl1, which functions in both a
paracrine and autocrine manner to protect tropho-
blast and non-trophoblast cells from ZIKV infection.
Our data suggest that for ZIKV to access the fetal
compartment, it must evade restriction by tropho-
blast-derived IFNl1 and other trophoblast-specific
antiviral factors and/or use alternative strategies to
cross the placental barrier.
INTRODUCTION
In eutherian organisms, the placenta acts as a physical and
immunological barrier between the maternal and fetal compart-
ments and protects the developing fetus from the vertical trans-
mission of viruses. In the human hemochorial placenta, the front-
line of fetal protection are the syncytiotrophoblasts, which cover
the surfaces of the human placental villous tree and are directly
bathed in maternal blood following the establishment of the
maternal circulatory system during the later stages of the first
trimester.
The mechanisms by which viruses can be transmitted verti-
cally are multifaceted and can involve entry into the gestational
sac via direct hematogenous spread, trophoblastic transcellular
or paracellular pathways, transport within immune cells or
infected sperm, pre-pregnancy uterine colonization, introduction
during invasive procedures during pregnancy, and/or trans-
vaginal ascending infection. The emerging Zika virus (ZIKV)
pandemic poses a new threat to the developing fetus. While usu-
ally causing relatively mild symptoms in non-pregnant individ-
uals, ZIKV infection in Brazil has been associated with increased
incidence of microcephaly (Cauchemez et al., 2016; Oliveira
Melo et al., 2016; Schuler-Faccini et al., 2016; Ventura et al.,
2016a). In addition, ZIKV infections have also been associated
with other disorders such as placental insufficiency and fetal
growth restriction, ocular disorders, other CNS anomalies, and
even fetal death (Brasil et al., 2016; Ventura et al., 2016b).
While direct evidence for a causal relationship between ZIKV
infections and the development of abnormal pregnancy out-
comes is still emerging, recent reports have directly identified
the presence of viral RNA (vRNA) and infectious virus in the pla-
centas, amniotic cavity, and brains of fetuses that had devel-
oped fetal anomalies (Calvet et al., 2016; Martines et al., 2016;
Mlakar et al., 2016). Interestingly, other flaviviruses, such as
dengue virus (DENV), which is endemic in the regions of Brazil
most impacted by the recent ZIKV outbreak, have not been
associated with microcephaly or other congenital disorders,
suggesting that ZIKV may exhibit unique mechanism(s) to
directly infect and/or bypass the placental barrier and to access
the fetal compartment and cause organ-specific damage.
The innate immune system is a primary host defense strategy
to suppress viral infections and converges on the induction of
interferons (IFNs), which function in autocrine and paracrine
manners to upregulate a cadre of other genes, known as IFN-
stimulated genes (ISGs). The effects of IFNs and ISGs are
potent and wide-ranging; they are pro-inflammatory, enhance
adaptive immunity, and are directly antiviral (Schneider et al.,
2014). In most cell types, type I IFNs, which include IFNa and
IFNb, are the primary IFNs that are generated in response to
viral infections. In contrast, cells of epithelial origin mount
antiviral responses primarily mediated by type III IFNs, which
include IFNl1–4 (also known as IL-29, IL-28A–C) (Lazear et al.,
2015b). The role of IFN signaling in the protection of placental

 trophoblasts from viral infections is unclear. Previous work has
pointed to unidentified IFN(s) present in first-trimester human
placentas (Lefe
` vre and Boulay, 1993). Ruminants express IFNt
at various stages of gestation (Bazer et al., 1996), and the mouse
placenta can produce IFNls in response to Listeria monocyto-
genes infection (Bierne et al., 2012).
Here we show that primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells, iso-
lated from full-term placentas, are refractory to infection by
two strains of ZIKV, one derived from an African lineage, and
one derived from an Asian lineage that exhibits > 99% amino
acid sequence similarity to strains currently circulating in Brazil
(Haddow et al., 2012). We also found that conditioned medium
(CM) isolated from PHT cells protected non-trophoblast cells
from ZIKV infection through the constitutive release of the type
III IFN IFNl1. Our findings thus suggest that for ZIKV to infect
syncytiotrophoblasts, it must overcome the restriction imparted
by IFNl1 and other syncytiotrophoblast-specific antiviral factors
and/or gain access to the fetal compartment by a mechanism
that does not involve syncytiotrophoblast infection, at least in
the latter stages of pregnancy.
RESULTS
PHT Cells Resist ZIKV Infection
To assess the ability of ZIKV to replicate in human placental tro-
phoblasts, we measured the replication of two strains of ZIKV,
one of African lineage (Haddow et al., 2012) (MR766, termed
ZIKVM hereafter) and one of Asian lineage (Haddow et al.,
2012) (FSS13025, termed ZIKVC hereafter) in PHT cells and a
panel of trophoblast-derived cell lines including BeWo, JEG-3,
and JAR choriocarcinoma cells and the extravillous trophoblast
cell line HTR8/SVneo (Graham et al., 1993). In addition, we
compared the level of infection of these cell types by DENV.
We also compared the infectivity of these cell types with that
of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), a
cell-based model of the blood-brain barrier (Stins et al., 2001)
that is permissive to DENV and both strains of ZIKV (Figure 1A,
Figure S1A). We found that BeWo, JEG-3, JAR, and HTR8/
SVneo cells supported infection by both ZIKVM and ZIKVC,
although BeWo cells were less susceptible to infection by
both DENV and ZIKV than the other trophoblast-derived cells
lines (Figure 1A, Figure S1A). In contrast, we were unable to
detect any evidence of ZIKV or DENV replication in PHT cells
by immunofluorescence microscopy (not shown). Consistent
with this, we found that PHT cells resisted infection by ZIKVM,
ZIKVC, and DENV, as evidenced by very low levels of total
vRNA (Figures S1B and S1C) and the lack of production of
the negative strand of vRNA, which is only produced during
viral replication (Figure 1B). These results are consistent with
our previous observations that PHT cells resist infection by
diverse RNA and DNA viruses (Delorme-Axford et al., 2013)
and show that ZIKV is unable to replicate efficiently in primary
trophoblasts.
CM Isolated from PHT Cells Protects Non-placental
Cells from ZIKV Infection
In addition to the resistance of PHT cells to ZIKV infection, we
found that CM isolated from uninfected PHT cells protected
non-placental recipient cells from infection by both isolates of
ZIKV and DENV (Figure 1C). Interestingly, we found that this pro-
tection was lost when CM was added after the establishment of
viral replication, as PHT CM exhibited no inhibitory effects on the
production of vRNA in cells stably propagating a DENV subge-
nomic replicon (Figure 1D, Figures S1D and S1E).
Using microarrays, we found that exposure of human fibrosar-
coma HT1080 (2fTGH) cells to PHT CM induced a subset of pre-
viously characterized ISGs (Schoggins et al., 2011), which did
not occur in HT1080 cells with defective signal transducer and
activator of transcription 1 (STAT1; 2fTGH-U3A cells) signaling
(McKendry et al., 1991) (Figure 2A, Table S1). We obtained

 similar results when cells were treated with IFNb (Figure 2A) as
previously described (Shu et al., 2015). We confirmed these re-
sults by RT-qPCR in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells that
were exposed to PHT CM, which led to the robust induction of
two known ISGs, IFN-induced protein 44-like (IFI44L) and IFN-
induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) (Fig-
ure 2B), and in human monocyte THP-1 cells as determined by
an IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-inducible SEAP reporter assay
(Figure S2A). In addition, RNA-seq revealed that PHT cells ex-
press high levels of ISGs (Figure 2C, Table S2). In contrast, the
trophoblast cell line JEG-3 did not endogenously express ISGs
(Figure 2C, Table S2), and CM isolated from these cells did not
induce ISGs in non-placental recipient cells (Figure S2B).
During culturing in vitro, PHT cells undergo fusion to form syn-
cytiotrophoblasts (Figure S2C) similar to their natural differentia-
tion process in vivo, which can be inhibited by exposing the cul-
tures to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Thirkill and Douglas, 1997).
We found that attenuation of PHT differentiation by DMSO
reduced the ability of PHT CM to induce IFI44L in recipient cells
(Figure 2D). Consistent with a role for syncytiotrophoblast fusion
in the induction of ISGs, we found that exposure of PHT cells to
epidermal growth factor (EGF), which promotes cell-cell fusion of

 trophoblasts (Morrish et al., 1987), enhanced the ISG-inducing
properties of PHT CM (Figure 2E). Importantly, ISG induction in
recipient cells was specific for PHT CM and did not occur
when cells were exposed to CM from the trophoblast-derived
cell lines BeWo, JEG-3, JAR, or HTR8 cells, suggesting that
this induction is specific for CM derived from primary tropho-
blasts (Figure 2E, Figure S2B). Furthermore, although BeWo
cell fusion can be stimulated by forskolin treatment (Wice
et al., 1990), this treatment did not confer ISG-inducing proper-
ties to BeWo CM (Figure 2F), suggesting that cell-cell fusion
alone is not sufficient to confer ISG-inducing properties to tro-
phoblasts. Lastly, we previously showed that PHT-derived exo-
somes released into PHT CM mediated some of the antiviral
properties of PHT CM (Delorme-Axford et al., 2013). We found
that CM depleted of vesicles was still capable of inducing ISGs
in recipient cells (Figure S2D), indicating that an ISG-inducing
pathway is present in PHT CM and bestows antiviral properties
independently from PHT-derived exosomes.
PHT Cells Release the Type III IFN IFNl1
We found by ELISAs that PHT CM contained negligible levels of
IFNb that were comparable to those in control non-CM, but
contained IFNl1 and, to a lesser extent, IFNl2, which was de-
tected in one PHT preparation (Figure 3A). In addition, PHT
cells expressed high levels of IFNl1 mRNA (Figure 3B), which
were consistent with the levels induced in non-PHT cells
(HBMECs) transfected with the synthetic ligand polyinosinic-
polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) to induce IFN production (Fig-
ure 3B). In addition, we found that anti-IFNl1/2 neutralizing
antibodies partially inhibited the induction of the ISG IFI44L
by PHT CM (Figure 3C). Furthermore, although CM isolated
from uninfected trophoblast-derived cell lines did not contain
detectable levels of IFNl1 (Figure S3A), we found that these
cells potently induced type III IFNs, primarily IFNl1, in response
to infection by Sendai virus (SeV, Figure 3D) and by both DENV
and ZIKV (Figure 3E). In contrast, PHT cells did not induce
IFNl1 or the ISG 20-50-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in
response to ZIKV or DENV infection, yet were highly resistant
to infection when compared to JEG-3 cells (Figure 3F, Fig-
ure S3B). However, PHT cells do induce both IFNl1 and
ISGs in response to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation by
poly I:C (Figure S3C). Finally, we found that RNAi-mediated
silencing of a subunit of the type III IFN receptor (IL28RA)
partially restored ZIKV infection in recipient cells exposed to
PHT CM depleted of vesicles (Figure 3G). Collectively, these
data point to a direct role for type III IFNs, particularly IFNl1,
in the antiviral signaling of placental syncytiotrophoblasts to
restrict viral infections, including ZIKV.
DISCUSSION
The strong association between ZIKV infection in pregnant
women with the development of fetal growth restriction and/or
CNS and other fetal congenital abnormalities, in addition to the
positive culture of ZIKV from feto-placental tissues of affected
pregnancies, suggests that ZIKV is capable of gaining access
into the intrauterine cavity to directly affect fetal development.
Our work presented here suggests that ZIKV is unlikely to access
the fetal compartment by its direct replication in placental syncy-
tiotrophoblasts, at least in the later stages of pregnancy, unless
ZIKV can bypass the antiviral properties of type III IFNs and other
syncytiotrophoblast-derived antiviral pathways during in vivo
infection of pregnant women. Because we observed potent pro-
tection from ZIKV infection by type III IFNs, specifically IFNl1,
which is constitutively produced by syncytiotrophoblasts, it is
likely functioning in an autocrine manner to protect these cells
from viral infections. In addition, we show that trophoblast-
derived IFNl1 protects non-placental cells from ZIKV infection
in a paracrine manner. A schematic of the human placenta and
the mechanisms by which IFNl1 protects syncytiotrophoblasts
from ZIKV infection is shown in Figure 4. Our work thus provides
evidence that ZIKV may not directly infect placental villous syn-
cytiotrophoblasts during later stages of pregnancy, suggesting
instead that the virus must either evade the potent type III IFN
antiviral signaling pathways generated by these cells and/or
bypass these cells through an as-yet-unknown pathway to
gain access to the fetal compartment.
Our previous studies implicated a role for trophoblast-
specific miRNAs associated with the placental-specific chro-
mosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC), contained within PHT-
derived exosomes, as part of the antiviral arsenal secreted by
PHT cells (Bayer et al., 2015; Delorme-Axford et al., 2013).
Indeed, our work presented here demonstrates another facet
of the antiviral mechanisms engaged by PHTs to protect the
developing fetus. These potent antiviral pathways likely func-
tion in parallel to provide multiple mechanisms to protect syncy-
tiotrophoblasts and other cell types at the maternal-fetal inter-
face from ZIKV and other viruses. It is also possible that other
as-yet-undiscovered pathways intrinsic to placental tropho-
blasts provide additional mechanisms to protect these cells
from viral infections. While we have not been able to reliably
measure IFNl in the plasma of pregnant women, this may be
because IFNl is below the limits of detection in the expanded
plasma volume of pregnant women and/or that the effects of
IFNl are local, affecting trophoblastic and non-trophoblastic
placental cells (such as villous fibroblasts) in the immediate vi-
cinity of the feto-placental unit.
Type III IFNs share significant structural homology with mem-
bers of the IL-10 cytokine family (Gad et al., 2009), but induce
ISGs similar to type I IFNs (Kotenko et al., 2003) through a
distinct receptor (Sheppard et al., 2003). We found that PHT cells
expressed high levels of IFNl1. Remarkably, IFNl1 was consti-
tutively released from PHT cells and did not require the activation
of antiviral innate immune signaling pathways to become
induced. Thus, in addition to studies that implicate an important
role for type III IFNs in antiviral signaling in the respiratory and
gastrointestinal tracts and the blood-brain barrier (Lazear et al.,
2015b), our work directly points to a role for type III IFNs, specif-
ically IFNl1, in antiviral signaling at the maternal-fetal interface.
Although type I IFNs are conserved between mice and humans,
there is significant divergence in the type III IFN pathway,
where humans express IFNl1–4 and mice express only IFNl2
and IFNl3. PHT cells expressed IFNl2 at significantly lower
levels than IFNl1 and did not express mRNA for either IFNl3
or IFNl4. Thus, in addition to the morphological differences
between the human and mouse placentas (Maltepe et al.,
2010), these data suggest that the IFNl1-mediated antiviral
properties of placental syncytiotrophoblasts may be distinct
708
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 705–712, May 11, 2016
 between humans and mice, which may complicate the use of the
mouse placenta as a model for viral infections of the placenta
during human pregnancy.
Another important implication of our work is that cells that do
not express the type III IFN receptor or do not respond robustly
to type III IFNs may be more susceptible to ZIKV infection, partic-
ularly at the maternal-fetal interface. In mice, the expression of
the a subunit of the IFNl receptor (IL-28RA) is restricted to
epithelial-derived cells, which respond most robustly to type III
IFNs (Sommereyns et al., 2008). Recent evidence also supports
a role for type III IFNs in the microvascular endothelium com-
prising the blood-brain barrier (Lazear et al., 2015a). Because
syncytiotrophoblasts and other trophoblasts that are epithelial
are likely protected by the potent stimulation of ISGs in response
to their constitutive production of IFNl1, our data suggest that
ZIKV may invade the intrauterine cavity by mechanisms that
are independent of direct trophoblast infection. In addition to
the trophoblast cell layers, the human placenta is also composed
of mesenchymal cells, placental-specific macrophages (termed
Hofbauer cells), and fibroblasts located within the villous core
between trophoblasts and fetal vessels that may exhibit differ-
ences in their responsiveness to IFNls. In addition, it is also

 possible that less differentiated, first-trimester trophoblasts as
well as extravillous trophoblasts are more permissive than late-
pregnancy villous trophoblasts to ZIKV infection and/or the anti-
viral effects of IFNls. Finally, it is possible that the levels of IFNl1
vary throughout pregnancy, or between individuals, which could
markedly impact the ability of the virus to infect the syncytiotro-
phoblast cell layer at specific times during pregnancy or in spe-
cific individuals.
The rapidly emerging human health crisis associated with the
ZIKV epidemic highlights the growing need to identify mecha-
nisms by which ZIKV accesses the fetal compartment. These
data will be instrumental in order to design therapeutic measures
to limit ZIKV replication and/or spread. Our experimental cell
system is directly relevant to the study of congenital ZIKV infec-
tions, by defining unique antiviral mechanisms at play in this
specialized environment. We provide evidence that ZIKV is un-
likely to access the fetal compartment by its direct infection of
late-pregnancy villous syncytiotrophoblasts and potentially
neighboring cells that express IL28RA, due to the role of type
III IFNs in the antiviral defense produced by human trophoblasts,
which suggests that the virus may circumnavigate these cells or
overcome this restriction in vivo in order to bypass the placental
barrier.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Culture of PHTs
PHT cells were isolated from healthy singleton term placentas using the
trypsin-DNase-dispase/Percoll method as described (Kliman et al., 1986),
with previously published modifications under an exempt protocol approved
by the institutional review board at the University of Pittsburgh. Patients pro-
vided written consent for the use of de-identified and discarded tissues for
research purposes upon admission to the hospital. Cells were maintained in
DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% FBS (HyClone) and antibiotics at 37�C in a
5% CO2 air atmosphere. Cells were then maintained for 72 hr after plating,
with cell quality ensured by microscopy and production of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG), determined by ELISA (DRG International). The cells ex-
hibited a characteristic increase in medium hCG levels as the cytotrophoblasts
differentiated into syncytiotrophoblasts.
Cells and Viruses
Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, Vero cells, 2fTGH (STAT1 wild-type) cells,
and U3A (STAT1 mutant) fibrosarcoma cells (previously described in McKen-
dry et al., 1991) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and an-
tibiotics. BeWo cells were maintained in F12K Kaighn’s modified medium sup-
plemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. JAR cells and immortalized, human,
first-trimester, extravillous trophoblast cells (HTR8/SVneo) were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS with antibiotics. Human
choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells were maintained in Eagle’s Minimum Essential
Medium (EMEM), supplemented with 10% FBS with antibiotics. HBMECs
were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10%
NuSerum, Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) vitamins, non-essential amino
acids, sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. HeLa CCL-2 cells were maintained
in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, non-essential amino acids, sodium py-
ruvate, and antibiotics. Development of HeLa cells stably propagating a DENV
subgenomic replicon has been previously described (Ansarah-Sobrinho et al.,
2008). Plasmids used to generate stable replicon cells were provided by The-
odore Pierson (Viral Pathogenesis Section Laboratory of Viral Diseases, NIH/
NIAID). Aedes albopictus midgut C6/36 cells were maintained in DMEM sup-
plemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics at 28�C in a 5% CO2 air atmosphere.
DENV2 16681 and ZIKV FSS13025 (Cambodian origin) were propagated in
C6/36 cells, as previously described (Vasilakis et al., 2008). ZIKV MR766
(Ugandan origin) was propagated in Vero cells. Viral titers were determined
by fluorescent focus assay, as previously described (Payne et al., 2006), using
anti-DENV envelope protein monoclonal antibody 4G2 (provided by Margaret
Kielian, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) for DENV and anti-double-
stranded RNA monoclonal antibody J2 (provided by Saumendra Sarkar, Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh) for ZIKV (specificity of the J2 antibody is shown in Fig-
ure S1G). SeV was purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Experiments
measuring productive DENV and ZIKV infection were performed with 1–3
focus-forming units/cell for 24 hr, unless otherwise stated, and SeV was
used at 100 hemagglutination units/cell for 24 hr. Infection was determined
by either RT-qPCR or immunofluorescence microscopy, as stated in the figure
legends.
Preparation and Characterization of CM
CM samples from PHT cells or other cells were harvested at 72 hr after plating,
followed by centrifugation at 8003 g for 5 min. Non-conditioned medium
Figure 4. Schematic Depicting the Structure of the Human Placenta and the Role of IFNl1 in Protecting against ZIKV Infection
(A) The intrauterine environment during human pregnancy. Embryonic structures include the villous tree of the human hemochorial placenta and the umbilical
cord, which transfers blood between the placenta and the fetus.
(B) An overview of a single placental villus. Extravillous trophoblasts invade and anchor the placenta to the maternal decidua and to the inner third of the my-
ometrium. The villous tree consists of both floating and anchoring villi. Multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts overlie the surfaces of the villous tree and are in direct
contact with maternal blood, which fills the intervillous space (IVS) once the placenta is fully formed. Mononuclear cytotrophoblasts are subjacent to the syn-
cytiotrophoblasts and the basement membrane of the villous tree and serve to replenish the syncytiotrophoblast layer throughout pregnancy.
(C) In the work presented here, we show that syncytiotrophoblasts release IFNl1 that can act in both autocrine and paracrine manners to induce ISGs, which
protect against ZIKV and other viral infections. The paracrine function of IFNl could work locally within the direct maternal-fetal compartment or might circulate
more systemically to act on other maternal target cells.

 (NCM) was complete PHT medium (described above) that had not been
exposed to PHT cells. Recipient cells were exposed to CM for �24 hr before
assays. Vesicle-depleted CM was generated by three centrifugation steps:
2,5003 g for 5 min at room temperature, followed by 12,0003 g for 20 min
at room temperature, and 100,0003 g for 2 hr at 4�C. Antiviral activity of CM
preparations was determined in HBMECs exposed to CM for 24 hr prior to
infection with DENV, ZIKVM, or ZIKVC.
RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and RT-qPCR
For cellular mRNA analysis, total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (MRC)
or GenElute total RNA miniprep kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (QIAGEN or
Sigma). Total RNA was reverse transcribedusing High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-
Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Strand-specific cDNA was
produced with primers targeting the negative RNA strand DENV or ZIKV using
iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). RT-qPCR was performed using
SYBR Select or iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a StepOnePlus real-
time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), ViiA 7 System (Applied Biosystems),
or CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). Gene expression was calculated using
the 2-delta delta CT method normalized to GAPDH or actin. Primer sequences
are located in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. The specificity of
ZIKV and DENV primers were confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis (Figure S1F).
RNA-Seq and Microarray Analyses
RNA-seq from JEG-3 and PHT cells was performed as previously described
(McConkey et al., 2016). Briefly, libraries were prepared with the NEB Ultra Li-
brary Preparation Kit, and library quality was determined using the Qubit Assay
and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Sequencing was performed with the Illumina
HiSeq 2500 rapid-run mode on one flow cell (two lanes). CLC Genomics Work-
bench 8 (QIAGEN) was used to process, normalize, and map sequence data to
the human reference genome (hg19). Differentially expressed genes were
identified using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) with a significance cut-off of
0.05, and heat maps were generated using MeViewer software. Files associ-
ated with RNA-seq studies have been deposited into Sequence Read Archive
under accession number SRA: SRP067137.
We used high-throughput microarray analysis as previously described (Shu
et al., 2015) to screen for transcriptional changes in control (2fTGH) versus
STAT1 signaling-deficient (U3A) HT1080 cells, both exposed to 100 U of puri-
fied IFNb (PBL) or PHT CM for 24 hr. In parallel, mock-treated 2fTGH and U3A
were also included and were used to identify differentially expressed genes in
IFNb- and CM-treated cells. Datasets related to these arrays have been
deposited in GEO: GSE72342.
Statistics
Experiments were performed at least three times as indicated in the figure leg-
ends or as detailed. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Except where specified,
a Student’s t test was used to determine statistical significance for virus infec-
tion assays when two sets were compared, and one-way ANOVA with Bonfer-
roni’s correction used for post hoc multiple comparisons was used to deter-
mine statistical significance. Specific p values are detailed in the figure legends.
