Abstract
BACKGROUND—The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) assesses the function of all nephrons, and 
the single-nephron GFR assesses the function of individual nephrons. How the single-nephron 
GFR relates to demographic and clinical characteristics and kidney-biopsy findings in humans is 
unknown.
METHODS—We identified 1388 living kidney donors at the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland 
Clinic who underwent a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the kidney with the use of contrast 
material and an iothalamate-based measurement of the GFR during donor evaluation and who 
underwent a kidney biopsy at donation. The mean single-nephron GFR was calculated as the GFR 
divided by the number of nephrons (calculated as the cortical volume of both kidneys as assessed 
on CT times the biopsy-determined glomerular density). Demographic and clinical characteristics 
and biopsy findings were correlated with the single-nephron GFR.
RESULTS—A total of 58% of the donors were women, and the mean (±SD) age of the donors 
was 44±12 years. The mean GFR was 115±24 ml per minute, the mean number of nephrons was 
860,000±370,000 per kidney, and the mean single-nephron GFR was 80±40 nl per minute. The 
single-nephron GFR did not vary significantly according to age (among donors <70 years of age), 
sex, or height (among donors ≤190 cm tall). A higher single-nephron GFR was independently 
associated with larger nephrons on biopsy and more glomerulosclerosis and arteriosclerosis than 
would be expected for age. A higher single-nephron GFR was associated with a height of more 
than 190 cm, obesity, and a family history of end-stage renal disease.
CONCLUSIONS—Among healthy adult kidney donors, the single-nephron GFR was fairly 
constant with regard to age, sex, and height (if ≤190 cm). A higher single-nephron GFR was 
associated with certain risk factors for chronic kidney disease and certain kidney-biopsy findings.

 The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is considered to be the most important assessment of 
kidney function. In clinical practice, the total GFR, which is the sum of all the single-
nephron GFRs, is determined. Previous studies that have counted glomeruli at autopsy have 
shown considerable variation in the number of nephrons (210,000 to 2,700,000 nephrons per 
kidney),1,2 owing to congenital factors (nephron endowment at birth) and acquired factors 
(loss of nephrons). Variation in the number of nephrons hinders the assessment of function at 
the nephron level. In particular, nephron loss may result in a compensatory increase in the 
single-nephron GFR, which allows the total GFR to remain unchanged.
Pioneering work in animals, in which glomeruli underwent direct in vivo measurement of 
the single-nephron GFR, showed that the single-nephron GFR increases to adapt to either a 
reduced number of nephrons or increased metabolic demand.3,4 The single-nephron GFR 
varies according to genetic strains, decreases with volume depletion, and increases with age, 
body weight, acute volume expansion, and surgical removal of one kidney.4–7 The extent to 
which data from animals apply to humans has proved elusive. Enlarged glomeruli in humans 
suggest maladaptive increases in the single-nephron GFR or hyperfiltration.8–11 An increase 
in the single-nephron GFR is often inferred from an increase in the total GFR (since new 
nephrons are not generated).12 However, to our knowledge, the determination of the actual 
single-nephron GFR in humans has not been possible.
We developed a method to determine the single-nephron GFR in living kidney donors. 
Kidney donors are selected on the basis of good health and thus do not have clinically 
evident chronic kidney disease or major risk factors for chronic kidney disease, such as 
diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, substantial variation exists among donors 
across categories of age, sex, height, kidney function, kidney-biopsy findings, and some risk 
factors for chronic kidney disease. Studying the association of the single-nephron GFR with 
these characteristics may provide insights into the function of the human nephron.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
We analyzed data from the Aging Kidney Anatomy study as described previously.13–15 Data 
sources were all from the usual care of kidney donors, and the study was approved by an 
institutional review board with a waiver of informed consent.
The study population included living kidney donors from 2000 through 2011 at the Mayo 
Clinic, in Minnesota, and the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio. Before donation, the donors 
underwent a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the kidneys with the use of contrast 
material and measurement of iothalamate clearance for the assessment of the total GFR, and 
at the time of donation, they underwent a needle-core biopsy of the donated kidney. 
Additional donors 65 years of age or older who had been patients at the Mayo Clinic in the 
period from 2012 through 2015 were included in the study to increase the sample of older 
donors. All the donors underwent a thorough medical evaluation before donation, with a 
prescheduled battery of tests.

 Hypertension was defined as a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg or the use of anti-
hypertensive medication to lower blood pressure. Only donors with mild hypertension 
(defined as a blood pressure that was either slightly elevated or controlled with one 
antihypertensive agent, with or without the use of a thiazide diuretic) were accepted. A 
family history of end-stage renal disease was determined according to biologic relationship 
to the kidney recipient. The predonation evaluation also included the determination of the 
body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in 
meters), the 24-hour urinary albumin excretion, and the serum uric acid level. Acceptable 
criteria for donation varied according to study site and calendar year, but mild hypertension 
in older donors and moderate obesity (BMI, 30 to 35) were generally allowed; the 24-hour 
urinary albumin excretion had to be less than 30 mg, and the total GFR had to be normal for 
the donor’s age.16
KIDNEY-BIOPSY MORPHOMETRIC AND STEREOLOGIC ASSESSMENTS
A needle-core biopsy sample of the kidney cortex was obtained during the transplantation 
surgery. The tissue specimen was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Two 
consecutive 3-μm sections were stained (one with periodic acid–Schiff and one with 
Masson’s trichrome) and scanned into high-resolution digital images (Aperio XT System 
scanner). The inclusion criteria for all the biopsy sections were that they could not contain 
an artifact that severely distorted microstructures, they had to have an area with at least 2 
mm2 of cortex, and they had to have at least four glomeruli.
Specific measurements of nephron size were the mean nonsclerotic glomerular volume and 
the mean cross-sectional tubular area (Fig. 1). Specific measurements of nephrosclerosis 
were glomerulosclerosis (globally sclerosed glomeruli in ≥10% of all glomeruli), interstitial 
fibrosis (fibrosis and tubular atrophy of >5% of the cortex), and arteriosclerosis (intimal 
thickening of >50% of an artery lumen within the biopsy sample) (Fig. 1). The total number 
of nephrons was calculated as the density of nonsclerotic glomeruli in the biopsy sample 
times the cortical volume of both kidneys and rounded to the nearest 10,000 nephrons. The 
single-nephron GFR was then calculated as the total GFR divided by the calculated total 
number of nephrons (see the Detailed Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Age was categorized as 18 to 29 years, 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, 60 to 
64 years, 65 to 69 years, and 70 to 75 years. The mean total GFR, the mean number of 
nephrons, and the mean single-nephron GFR were calculated for each age group. 
Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the relation between the single-nephron 
GFR and age (as a continuous variable), sex, BMI (continuous variable), height (continuous 
variable), the serum uric acid level (continuous variable), family history of end-stage renal 
disease (yes vs. no), and hypertension (yes vs. no). An additional model included the 24-
hour urinary albumin excretion as a predictor with the use of only the donors at the 
Minnesota site (data not available at the Ohio site). Separate multivariable regression models 
examined the relation between the single-nephron GFR and the findings of nephrosclerosis

 and the measurement of nephron size on biopsy. The associations of the number of nephrons 
and the total GFR with these same demographic, clinical, and biopsy-sample characteristics 
were also assessed in multivariable models. To assess the robustness of the associations, 
sensitivity analyses were performed that limited the sample to donors with at least 4 mm2 of 
cortex in the tissue obtained during biopsy or to donors younger than 70 years of age, and 
site-specific analysis was performed. All the statistical analyses were performed with the use 
of JMP software, version 10.0 (SAS Institute).
RESULTS
DONOR CHARACTERISTICS
We identified 1388 living kidney donors (1282 donors at the Mayo Clinic [25 of whom were 
added to increase the sample of donors ≥65 years of age] and 106 at the Cleveland Clinic) 
who had undergone a CT scan and kidney biopsy to determine the number of nephrons and 
an iothalamate clearance to determine the total GFR. Arteriosclerosis was assessed in the 
1210 donors who had an artery present in the kidney-biopsy sample, and 24-hour urinary 
albumin excretion values were available in 1221 donors. The demographic, clinical, biopsy-
sample, and CT characteristics of the donors are presented in Table 1.
ASSOCIATIONS WITH DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS
The number of nephrons per kidney and the total GFR both declined with age, whereas the 
single-nephron GFR remained stable at approximately 79 nl per minute until 70 years of age 
(Table 2, and Fig. S1A in the Supplementary Appendix). The single-nephron GFR was 
higher among the 13 donors who were 70 to 75 years of age at donation than among donors 
younger than 70 years of age (110 vs. 79 nl per minute, P<0.001), which reflects nephron 
loss that exceeds the age-related decline in the total GFR. The total GFR did not show the 
expected decline from the subgroup of donors 65 to 69 years of age to the subgroup of 
donors 70 to 75 years of age, but there were few donors in the oldest group. The number of 
nephrons was higher in men than in women (910,000 vs. 830,000, P<0.001), as was the total 
GFR (124 vs. 108 ml per minute, P<0.001). However, the single-nephron GFR did not differ 
significantly between men and women (81 nl per minute and 79 nl per minute, respectively; 
P = 0.28) (Fig. S1B, S1C, and S1D in the Supplementary Appendix).
In an analysis that was adjusted for each of the other clinical characteristics, higher BMI, 
taller height, and family history of end-stage renal disease were associated with a higher 
single-nephron GFR (Table 3). Of these variables, higher BMI and taller height were also 
associated with higher total GFR. Older age, female sex, shorter height, and higher uric acid 
levels were associated with a lower total GFR because these characteristics were associated 
with a lower number of nephrons. The association of a family history of end-stage renal 
disease with both a lower number of nephrons and a higher single-nephron GFR resulted in 
no association with the total GFR. Mild hypertension was not associated with the number of 
nephrons, the single-nephron GFR, or the total GFR. In models that included 24-hour 
urinary albumin excretion values, a higher urinary albumin excretion was associated with a 
higher total GFR but was not associated with either the number of nephrons or the single-
nephron GFR (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

 In an unadjusted analysis, we also observed an increase in the single-nephron GFR with 
higher BMI (P<0.001 for trend). The single-nephron GFR was not associated with height (as 
a continuous variable) up to 190 cm in men or women (P>0.05 for the comparisons in each 
sex subgroup), but the 31 participants who were taller than 190 cm (all men) had a higher 
single-nephron GFR than did other donors (98 vs. 79 nl per minute, P=0.008). These tall 
donors also had a higher total GFR than other donors (147 vs. 114 ml per minute, P<0.001), 
although the number of nephrons was similar (900,000 and 860,000, respectively; P=0.55). 
Donors with a family history of end-stage renal disease had a higher single-nephron GFR 
than did those without such a family history (83 vs. 75 nl per minute, P = 0.002). Details are 
provided in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
ASSOCIATIONS WITH BIOPSY FINDINGS
The kidney-biopsy findings of glomerulosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, larger glomerular 
volume, and larger tubular area were independently associated with a higher single-nephron 
GFR (Table 4, and Figs. S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Nephrosclerosis 
(specifically, glomerulosclerosis or arteriosclerosis) was associated with both a lower 
number of nephrons and a higher single-nephron GFR, and the net effect was no association 
with total GFR. The status of having larger nephrons (larger glomerular volume or tubular 
cross-sectional area) was also associated with both a lower number of nephrons and a higher 
single-nephron GFR, but the net effect was an association with a higher total GFR.
To estimate whether the clinical characteristics that were associated with the single-nephron 
GFR were mediated by larger nephron size or nephrosclerosis, we performed multivariable 
analyses with demographic and clinical characteristics and with biopsy-sample 
characteristics (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The associations of a higher 
single-nephron GFR with higher BMI, taller height, and family history of end-stage renal 
disease were attenuated in the analysis that was adjusted for nephron size, which suggests 
that larger nephrons are the main reason that a higher single-nephron GFR is associated with 
these clinical characteristics.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
The associations of demographic, clinical, and biopsy-sample characteristics with the single-
nephron GFR did not differ significantly according to age (P>0.05 for all age-by-
characteristic interactions), nor did they substantially change in analyses that were limited 
either to donors who had a biopsy sample with at least 4 mm2 of cortex or to donors younger 
than 70 years of age. Associations were consistent between the two study sites except that 
we found that higher BMI was not associated with a higher single-nephron GFR at the Ohio 
site. Details are provided in Tables S3 through S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.
DISCUSSION
A key finding in the present study is that the single-nephron GFR varied little according to 
age, sex, and height (if ≤190 cm), despite substantial variation in the number of nephrons in 
this population of normal, healthy kidney donors. This absence of significant variation in the 
single-nephron GFR suggests that nephron function is similar across common physiological

 differences among healthy humans. Certain acquired risk factors for chronic kidney disease 
(e.g., obesity) or inherent risk factors for chronic kidney disease (e.g., family history of end-
stage renal disease) were associated with a higher single-nephron GFR, which appears to be 
driven by larger individual nephron size. Nephrosclerosis that was observed in a biopsy 
sample and that exceeded a level that would be expected for age was correlated with a higher 
single-nephron GFR, independent of nephron size.
We observed a higher single-nephron GFR among the very few donors who were 70 years of 
age or older than among younger donors, which we speculate is attributable to the selection 
bias that probably occurs with the oldest donors. Although age-based criteria were used to 
select donors, persons with a total GFR below a threshold of approximately 70 to 80 ml per 
minute are not accepted as donors, regardless of age.
The number of nephrons declines with age, owing to nephrosclerosis15; but the single-
nephron GFR in the remaining nonsclerotic glomeruli does not increase with age (at least 
among persons <70 years of age). The mechanisms underlying the failure to compensate for 
this loss of nephrons are unclear but might be due to a concurrent decrease in metabolic 
demand that could influence the GFR. The absence of an increase in glomerular volume14 or 
glomerular filtering capacity17 with healthy aging is consistent with that observation. There 
was no evidence of effect modification according to age on the higher single-nephron GFR 
that was associated with other characteristics.
Several plausible mechanisms may account for the associations of clinical characteristics 
and biopsy-sample findings with a higher single-nephron GFR. Obesity is a risk factor for 
chronic kidney disease18 and is known to increase the total GFR.19 Obesity increases renal 
metabolic demand, leading to an increase in the single-nephron GFR that can become 
maladaptive, resulting in obesity-related glomerulopathy.10 Patients with a family history of 
end-stage renal disease may have a familial predisposition toward fewer nephrons because of 
genetic and epigenetic factors.1 However, an increased single-nephron GFR compensates for 
fewer nephrons, resulting in a sustained total GFR.
Height was associated with a higher total GFR, which was related primarily to a higher 
number of nephrons but also possibly related to a higher single-nephron GFR in the 
relatively few participants who were taller than 190 cm. Adult height correlates directly with 
birth weight,20 and birth weight may be considered to be a surrogate for nephron 
endowment.21 To our knowledge, there is no evidence that tall stature (>190 cm) is a risk 
factor for chronic kidney disease. However, tall stature in a person who had a low birth 
weight (and for whom there may be low nephron endowment) has been linked to 
hypertension,22,23 which is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease.
Nephrosclerosis is an ischemic process that leads to nephron loss. The presence of 
nephrosclerosis probably explains the age-related decline in the total GFR over time.14,15,24 
Seemingly healthy persons can also have more nephrosclerosis than expected for their age, 
yet may not have a further reduction in the total GFR.14,24 This study showed that 
nephrosclerosis exceeding that expected for age decreased the number of nephrons but was 
generally accompanied by a compensatory higher single-nephron GFR, which maintained

 the total GFR. The apparent failure of the single-nephron GFR to increase with the expected 
age-related nephron loss, whereas it increased with nephro-sclerosis beyond the level 
expected for age, may support an age-based approach to the identification of chronic kidney 
disease.25
Previous studies have linked larger nephrons to a higher single-nephron GFR in an animal 
model,26 and the present study extends this finding to humans. In studies in animals, surgical 
renal ablation leads to a higher glomerular pressure and blood flow, which drives increases 
in both glomerular size and single-nephron GFR.11 Indeed, glomerular enlargement with a 
higher single-nephron GFR may prevent nephron destruction caused by glomerular 
hypertension.27 In the present study, we observed an association of some clinical 
characteristics with a higher single-nephron GFR (obesity, family history of end-stage renal 
disease, and height >190 cm), and these findings are also associated with larger nephrons.14 
Nephrosclerosis was associated with a higher single-nephron GFR, independent of nephron 
size. Thus, a larger nephron size on biopsy is an imperfect surrogate for a higher single-
nephron GFR. The identification of the point at which a high single-nephron GFR becomes 
maladaptive and leads to chronic kidney disease would entail additional studies in 
populations that are less healthy than the donors we studied.
Our study has certain limitations. The Weibel–Gomez stereologic models do not account for 
variation in the glomerular volume distribution within biopsy samples, which may have 
introduced a small level of bias in the nephron-number estimates. Nonetheless, our estimates 
of the number of nephrons in living humans are similar to those calculated by the disector–
fractionator method that is applied to kidneys obtained from an autopsy.15,28 There is also 
good agreement between the Weibel–Gomez method and a method based on assessment of 
multiple consecutive kidney-biopsy sections.29 We could determine only the mean single-
nephron GFR, which might be higher in deep glomeruli than in superficial glomeru-li.30 The 
coefficient of variation for repeat-test single-nephron GFR is estimated at 41% on the basis 
of a coefficient of variation of 33% for the number of nephrons15 and a coefficient of 
variation of 8% for the total GFR.31 Therefore, for population-level inferences, the mean 
number of nephrons could be reasonably estimated only to the nearest 10,000 nephrons, and 
the mean single-nephron GFR to the nearest 1 nl per minute; neither may have sufficient 
reliability for individual-level inferences. The study population was limited in that most of 
the living kidney donors were white. Selection on the basis of health probably biased the 
associations toward the null hypothesis. A higher single-nephron GFR might be associated 
with more severe hypertension and albuminuria than was seen in our study.
In conclusion, the single-nephron GFR can be calculated in living humans when a measured 
total GFR, kidney-biopsy sample, and cortical volume of the kidneys determined by means 
of radiographic imaging are available.

 Figure 1. Kidney-Biopsy Sample with Structural Measurements
The volume and density of nonsclerotic glomeruli were calculated with the use of 
stereologic assessments from the area of their cross sections (red outline) and the area of the 
cortex (green outline) (Panel A). The number of tubules in an area of cortex measuring 1 
mm2 (excluding glomeruli, fibrosis, and arteries) was used to calculate the mean cross-
sectional tubular area. The volume of the kidney cortex was determined by means of CT 
scans with the use of contrast material (Panel B) and was multiplied by the nonsclerotic 
glomerular density to calculate the number of nephrons. Panel C shows a specimen with 
glomerulosclerosis (in >10% of glomeruli); the number of globally sclerotic glomeruli (pink 
outlined areas with arrowheads) was divided by the number of both nonsclerotic glomeruli 
(red outline) and globally sclerotic glomeruli. Panel D shows a specimen with interstitial 
fibrosis (in >5% of the cortex); the percentage of the cortex that had fibrosis with tubular 
atrophy (black dashed outline) was estimated by means of visual inspection. Panel E shows a 
specimen with arteriosclerosis (intimal thickening of >50% of an artery lumen within the 
biopsy sample; a threshold just met by the specimen shown); the percent of artery luminal 
stenosis was calculated from the area of intima (shown between the yellow and red outlines) 
divided by the area of intima plus lumen (inside the red outline).

*The estimate is the difference with the presence of the characteristic versus its absence (female sex vs. male sex; presence vs. absence of family history of end-stage renal disease; and mild hypertension vs. 
no hypertension) or with the level increase of the characteristic (for age, body-mass index, height, and uric acid level). The standard deviation (SD) was 4.9 for body-mass index, 9.5 cm for height, and 1.4 
mg per deciliter (80 μmol per liter) for uric acid. The analysis was adjusted for each of the other demographic or clinical characteristics in the 1388 donors.
†Statistical significance for the single-nephron GFR was influenced by donors with a height of more than 190 cm.

*The estimate is the difference with the presence of the characteristic versus its absence (for each nephrosclerosis category) or with the level increase of the characteristic (for nephron size). The standard 
deviation (SD) was 0.0010 mm3 for glomerular volume and 1490 μm2 for tubular area. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, and each of the other biopsy-sample characteristics in the 1210 donors who 
had an artery present within the kidney-biopsy sample.
