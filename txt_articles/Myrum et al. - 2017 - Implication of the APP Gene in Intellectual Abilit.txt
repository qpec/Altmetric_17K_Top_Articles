Abstract.
Background: Cognitive functions are highly heritable and polygenic, though the source of this genetic influence is unclear.
On the neurobiological level, these functions rely on effective neuroplasticity, in which the activity-regulated cytoskeleton
associated protein (ARC) plays an essential role.
Objectives: To examine whether the ARC gene complex may contribute to the genetic components of intellectual function
given the crucial role of ARC in brain plasticity and memory formation.
Methods: The ARC complex was tested for association with intelligence (IQ) in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study
of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 5,165). As Alzheimer’s disease (AD) shares genetics with cognitive functioning, the
association was followed up in an AD sample (17,008 cases, 37,154 controls).
Results: The ARC complex revealed association with verbal and total IQ (empirical p = 0.027 and 0.041, respectively) in the
ALSPAC. The strongest single variant signal (rs2830077; empirical p = 0.018), within the APP gene, was confirmed in the
AD sample (p = 2.76E-03). Functional analyses of this variant showed its preferential binding to the transcription factor CP2.
Discussion: This study implicates APP in childhood IQ. While follow-up studies are needed, this observation could help
elucidate the etiology of disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction, such as AD.

INTRODUCTION
Cognitive function varies between individuals, and
is a key predictor of important life outcomes such
as mental and physical health as well as longevity
[1]. General intellectual function, commonly mea-
sured by an aggregated score (intelligence quotient,
IQ) across a wide range of cognitive tasks, can be
considered a main trait behind this variation [2]. It
is well established that intelligence is highly herita-
ble and polygenic [3]. Nonetheless, the extent and
nature of this genetic influence is still unknown [4]
and warrants further investigation.

Intelligence captures a broad scope of cognitive
abilities and can be enumerated by measures of
verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ), often
differentiated into crystallized and fluid types. Crys-
tallized and fluid IQ represent different aspects of
intelligence, both behaviorally and biologically [5].
Crystallized intelligence includes knowledge accu-
mulated throughout life, determined by education
and experience, while fluid intelligence consists of
problem solving and reasoning abilities that has little
reliance on stored knowledge [6]. Fluid intelligence is
strongly correlated with working memory and func-
tional activity observed by magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) during cognitive tasks [7, 8]. Although
these two IQ measures can be combined into a full
scale IQ (FSIQ), research on the neural basis of intel-
ligence suggests that it could be best represented by
at least two dimensions rather than one [5].

C. Myrum et al. / Implication of the APP Gene in Intellectual Abilities
The heritability of intelligence has been estimated
to increase with age, from ∼30% in childhood up to
80% in adulthood [9]. However, despite such high
heritability, intelligence-related phenotypes have not
been robustly associated with any single gene or
variant [3, 10]. Only recently did a large-scale
genome-wide association study (GWAS) on these
traits identify 13 variants associated with general
cognitive function [11]. This confirms that genetic
architecture of intelligence involves many genes of
small effect, suggesting that the impact of a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may not be detected
without large sample sizes.
The lack of robust association is common in the
search for genes behind polygenic traits, such as intel-
ligence [3, 11, 12]. Little progress has been made in
finding loci that explain even a small fraction of the
phenotypic variance in complex traits [13], posing
one of the biggest challenges in present-day behav-
ioral genetics. One promising approach to address
this limitation is the examination of functionally
related genes as a complex, thereby combining their
effects [14].
At the neurobiological level, intellectual and cog-
nitive functions rely on effective neuroplasticity, the
brain’s ability to alter neural networks and synapses.
Activity-regulated cytoskeleton associated protein
(Arc) and its regulators and interactors have been
extensively studied due to their essential role in multi-
ple forms of synaptic plasticity [15–17]. Arc appears
to play hub-like role in its regulation [18], at least
partially by modifying actin cytoskeleton dynamics,
receptor endocytosis, and glutamate receptor tran-
scription [15–17]. Thus, ARC (here we refer to the
gene as “ARC” and its RNA/protein as “Arc”) and its
partners provide a promising set of candidate genes
for uncovering genetic components of intellectual
function. Here, we collectively refer to these func-
tionally linked genes as the “ARC complex” (Table 1).
The genes in the ARC complex have been impli-
cated in a number of conditions characterized by
cognitive disabilities, including schizophrenia [19],
Angelman syndrome [20], normal cognitive aging
[21], and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [22]. Notably, the
ARC complex contains multiple AD-related genes,
including amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose
proteolysis generates an AD hallmark, amyloid-�
(A�).
In this study, we hypothesized that the ARC com-
plex may contribute to individual differences in
intellectual function. We curated the complex and
tested whether its SNPs are associated with IQ scores
in children of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Par-
ents and Children (ALSPAC). Since polygenic risk
for AD is highly correlated with cognitive function
[23], we next determined whether SNPs revealing
significant association with intelligence in children
were also associated with AD in adults in the Inter-
national Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP).
Lastly, we examined whether the most strongly asso-
ciated SNPs may have functional relevance in gene
expression.
METHODS
Curation and Assessment of ARC Functional
Complex
The ARC gene set was constructed based on
Arc interaction partners and regulators, as evidenced
in the literature (Table 1). We followed the Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Statement [24]. PubMed
entries linked to human, mouse, and rat ARC genes
(NCBI Gene IDs: 23237, 11838, and 54323, respec-
tively) were obtained on December 14, 2014 using
an NCBI cross-reference query. The search yielded
185 papers, all of which were screened to iden-
tify those papers showing experimental evidence for
Arc interaction partners and regulators (n = 13). The
remaining papers’ references were then examined
further, which led to the identification of six addi-
tional relevant papers. From these 19 sources, a total
of 37 experimentally-verified interaction partners
and regulators were identified (Supplementary Fig-
ure 1). The gene complex was evaluated in STRING
database, version 10 [25], to confirm its network con-
nectivity and assess its enrichment for the biological
and cellular processes based on gene ontology (GO).
False discovery rate (FDR) was applied to correct for
multiple testing.
Participants and genotyping
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC) sample
The ALSPAC sample was derived from a well-
characterized population-based study carried out in
southwest England [26]. Pregnant women residing
in the Bristol area of the United Kingdom, who
had an estimated date of delivery between April 1,
1991 and December 31, 1992, were recruited to
take part. Of the original 14,541 pregnancies, 13,988
children were alive at one year. An additional 713

children were enrolled after age seven, resulting in
a total sample of 14,701 children. These mother-
child pairs have been followed for over 20 years
generating an immense amount of data through bio-
logical samples, measurements, and questionnaires.
The study website contains details of all the data that
is available through a fully searchable data dictio-
nary: http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-
access/data-dictionary/. Ethical approval for the
study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and
Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics
Committees. Phenotype-matched genotype data were
available for up to 6,832 children, depending on the
variables.
Assessment of intellectual function was performed
at 8.5 years of age using the third edition of the
Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III)
[27]. Intellectual function was measured by the full-
scale IQ score (FSIQ), comprised of both a verbal
score (VIQ) generated from the vocabulary subtest
and a performance score (PIQ) generated from the
matrix reasoning subtest. For more details, refer
to the ALSPAC data dictionary (http://www.bris.ac.
uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/).
Normal distribution of these variables was assured
and all outliers were removed (mean ± 3 standard
deviations (SD)). ALSPAC participants’ DNA was
extracted from whole blood or buccal swab samples

and prepared for genotyping using standard proto-
cols. A total of 9,912 participants were genotyped
using the Illumina HumanHap550 platform. SNPs
with a minor allele frequency of <1% and call rate
of <95% were removed. Furthermore, only SNPs
passing the exact test of Hardy–Weinberg equilib-
rium (p > 5.00 × 10–7) were considered for analyses.
Detailed quality control measures can be found at
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/alspac/mi
grated/documents/gwas-data-generation.pdf. Known
autosomal variants were imputed with MACH 1.0.16
Markov Chain Haplotyping software [28], using
CEPH individuals from phase 2 of the HapMap
project (HG18) as a reference (release 22). Only
SNPs with imputation quality estimates above 0.3
were examined.
Additional quality control was performed in the
subset of individuals with available IQ measures to
ensure that no SNPs or individuals had poor geno-
typing rates (<95%) and that no SNPs were rare
(minor allele frequency, MAF <1%) or out of Hardy-
Weinberg Equilibrium (p < 1.00E-05).
International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project
(IGAP) sample
ARC complex SNPs were extracted from the sum-
mary statistics of the IGAP GWAS (http://www.pa
steur-lille.fr/en/recherche/u744/igap/igap download.
php) on individuals of European ancestry. IGAP used
genotyped and imputed data on 7,055,881 SNPs
to meta-analyze four previously-published GWAS
datasets [namely, the European Alzheimer’s Disease
Initiative (EADI), the Alzheimer Disease Genetics
Consortium (ADGC), the Cohorts for Heart and
Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consor-
tium (CHARGE), and the Genetic and Environmental
Risk in AD consortium (GERAD)], consisting of
17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls [29].
Statistical analyses
To examine the contribution of ARC complex to
cognitive function, we carried out the following anal-
yses: (1) tests for association between ARC complex
genes and IQ scores in ALSPAC (gene-set tests); (2)
genes found to be significant in the gene-set test were
further examined for single SNP-based association
in ALSPAC; and (3) given reported shared genetics
between cognitive function and AD, significant SNPs
in ALSPAC were examined in the IGAP to check for
association with AD. These analyses are described in
more detail below.
Gene-set tests of ARC complex
Here, we tested the entire ARC complex, followed
by “ARC expression” and “Arc function” subgroups
individually (Table 1) in ALSPAC. The “ARC expres-
sion” subgroup included proteins implicated in the
regulation of ARC transcription, mRNA processing,
transport, Arc protein translation and degradation,
while the Arc function subgroup included proteins
that bind Arc or are closely associated with Arc func-
tion. ARC itself was not considered as a member of
“ARC expression” or “Arc function” subgroups as by
examining those subgroups we aimed at elucidating
the role of ARC regulators and interactors only. SNPs
within each gene in the complex (including those
within 5,000 base pairs upstream and 1,500 base
pairs downstream of each gene) were analyzed in
MAGMA, version 1.05 [30], where first the linkage
disequilibrium (LD) adjusted gene-based p-values
were calculated and then converted to Z-values to
regress on gene-set membership, as a predictor.
Gene size and gene-sets’ gene density were added
as covariates to account for possible confounding
effects. Only genes on autosomal chromosomes
were examined. Bonferroni correction was applied
to correct for multiple testing, with the significance
threshold set to 4.17E-03 (12 tests).
Single SNP-based tests
Genes revealing significant association in the gene-
set tests were further examined on a single SNP level.
Linear regressions were performed to test for associa-
tionbetweenSNPsandALSPACIQscoresinPLINK,
version 1.9 [31]. Sex was set as a covariate, and
only SNPs on autosomal chromosomes were exam-
ined. Correction for multiple testing was achieved
by one million permutations, producing a family-
wise empirical p-value. SNPs reaching family-wise
p-value below 0.05 were considered significant.
Variants found to be significantly associated with
IQ after correction for multiple testing were then
looked up in the IGAP to check for association with
AD.
Functional analyses
In silico assessment
SNPs surviving correction for multiple testing in
association analyses were examined in silico. We
used RegulomeDB [32] and HaploReg (version 4.1;
CEU population code; http://www.broadinstitute.
org/mammals/haploreg/) [33] to explore whether any
of the SNPs may affect gene expression. Given

the central role of hippocampus in ARC complex
processes and memory formation, we focused on
expression in hippocampal tissue. To investigate
whether any of the SNPs are located within transcrip-
tion factor binding sites, we utilized MatInspector
(Matrix Library 9.3; http://www.genomatix.de/soluti
ons/genomatix-genome-analyzer.html) and MATCH
(version 1.0; http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/
programs.html) engines. Variants with predicted
functional significance were then assessed further,
using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)
and luciferase reporter assays.

ing rs2830077 (NC 000021.9 : 26130583-26130284,

Phusion® High-FidelityDNAPolymerase(NEB)and
specific primers tagged with XhoI restriction sites
(forward: 5�-ATCCTCGAGTAGTTTCTTAAAACA

cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega),
and the A allele of rs2830077 was created by site-
directed mutagenesis using QuikChange Lightning
Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). The
fragment was then excised from the pGEM-T Easy
vector using XhoI restriction enzyme (NEB) and lig-
ated into the same site within the pGL3-Basic vector
(Promega) to ensure that the vector backbone used for
all the promoter constructs remained the same. The
sequences and orientation of inserts of all plasmids
were verified by direct sequencing.
HEK293FT cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were
cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), sodium pyruvate
(1 mM), glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/ml) and
streptomycin (100 �g/ml). Cells were plated into 96-
well plates (1 × 104 cells/well) and co-transfected
after24 husingLipofectamine2000(Invitrogen)with
80 ng pGL3 vector constructs and 20 ng pRL-TK
control plasmid (Promega) to allow normalization
of transfection efficiency. Transfections were car-
ried out in at least triplicates and repeated six times
in independent experiments. Cells were assayed for
firefly and Renilla luciferase activities 48 h after
transfection using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter
Assay System (Promega). Measurements were per-
formed on a VICTOR3 Multilabel Plate Reader
(Perkin Elmer). The ratio of firefly to Renilla
luciferase activity was calculated.
Image quantification and statistical analyses
Densitometric analysis was done using NIH
ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) and its differences
were assessed by one-way analyses of variance
(ANOVA), using SigmaPlot 13.0 (Systat Software).
RESULTS
Curation and Assessment of ARC Functional
Complex
After assembling our ARC complex (Table 1),
we evaluated its functional network in STRING
database, which uses experimental and predicted
protein-protein interaction information to assess con-
nectivity (Fig. 1). Protein-protein interactions were
significantly enriched (p = 4.8E-14) in the full ARC
complex, indicating that the proteins in the curated
gene set are biologically connected as a group. The
most significant enrichment of the ARC complex as
a whole was noted for cellular components (neu-
ron projection, GO:0043005, FDR = 2.59E-07 and
neuron part, GO:0097458, FDR = 2.59E-07). Supple-
mentary Table 1 reflects the main findings from these
assessments.
Similar to ARC complex, STRING examination
of its subgroups (“ARC expression” and “Arc func-
tion,” Table 1) revealed that both of them show
indication of biological protein-protein interactions,
with the “Arc function” subgroup displaying stronger
evidence (p = 1.52E-09) than the “ARC expression”

ter also showed less implication in GO pathways
(Supplementary Figure 2) compared to the “Arc
function” subgroup, where the strongest enrich-
ment was observed for neuron projection (GO:
0043005, FDR = 1.47E-07), followed by protein
binding (GO:0005515, FDR = 1.52E-07). Supple-
mentary Figure 2 depicts the results of ARC complex
subgroups STRING examination.
Participants and genotyping
The features of ALSPAC and IGAP samples are
summarized in Table 2. The characteristics of IGAP
sample were derived from its publication [29], com-
bining 18 datasets. The distribution of the three IQ
scores in ALSPAC is presented in Supplementary
Figure 3.
Statistical analyses
Gene-set tests of ARC complex
Tentative association was observed between the
functional subgroup (Table 1) of ARC complex and
VIQ as well as FSIQ in the ALSPAC (p = 0.027
and 0.041, respectively). No association signal sur-
vived correction for multiple testing. Supplementary
Table 2 shows the association results of all gene sets,
and individual genes comprising those, for all IQ
measures.
Single SNP-based tests
Since tentative association was observed for “ARC
function” subgroup only, we tested individual SNPs
in those genes for association with IQ measures
in ALSPAC. The strongest signals were observed
between 13 SNPs in the APP gene and PIQ, with 10
variants surviving the correction for multiple testing
(Table 3, Supplementary Figure 4). Another strong
signal was noted between rs1491579 in the SH3-
domain GRB2-like 3 (SH3GL3) gene (Table 3) and
FIQ, though it did not survive multiple test correction.
Supplementary Table 3 shows results of associa-
tion for all the variants reaching point-wise p-values
below 1.00E-03.
The 10 APP SNPs surviving the correction for
multiple testing in association analyses with the PIQ
score were then examined for association with AD
in IGAP. All 10 SNPs also revealed association sig-
nals with AD. Seven of these survived the Bonferroni
correction (p < 0.005; Table 3 and Supplementary
Figure 4).

within active chromatin compartments, with tran-
scription enhancer properties in hippocampus as well
as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) activity in
whole blood (Table 3).
H3K27Ac modification and DNAseI hypersen-
sitivity data at rs2830077 also suggested that this
region may be an enhancer (Supplementary Fig-
ure 5). The potential functional importance of this
SNP was supported in HaploReg, which implicated
rs2830077 in APP expression [34]. Further, Regu-
lomeDB, MatInspector, and MATCH all indicated
the presence of a putative transcription factor CP2
(TFCP2; also known as LBP-1c/CP2/LSF) binding
site at rs2830077. We also found that the matrix score
of rs2830077[A] is lower than that of the reference
allele C, suggesting that the TFCP2 may have higher
binding affinity to the C allele than to the A.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
To validate in silico predictions, we performed
EMSA using pure recombinant TFCP2 and synthetic
double-stranded oligonucleotides of the two alleles
of rs2830077. EMSA demonstrated a shifted band
of a DNA-protein complex, with a stronger intensity
corresponding to its C allele (46% greater intensity of
retarded band; Supplementary Figure 6), confirming
its higher binding affinity of TFCP2.

Luciferase reporter assay
To validate the ability of rs2830077 to modulate
transcription, we performed a luciferase assay with
thefirstAPPintronharboringthisSNP.Theluciferase
activities for both orientations of the A allele were
lower than corresponding activities of the C allele
(28% and 23% lower luciferase activity for antisense
and sense orientation, respectively; Fig. 2), confirm-
ing that rs2830077 may alter enhancer-like activity
of this region.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we utilized a pathway approach to
studygeneticsofcognitioninchildren(ALSPAC)and
followeduptheobservedassociationsignalsinasam-
ple of adults with and without AD (IGAP). Further,
we performed a functional examination of associated
variants in cell culture. Our experimental approach
was prompted by evidence that: (1) cognitive ability
may be influenced by genetic variation in synaptic
plasticity-related genes [35], (2) AD shares polygenic
etiologywithcognitivefunctioning[23],and(3)path-
way analyses of functionally related genes can be
advantageous as they combine the effect of multiple
genes that may be biologically meaningful [14]. Our
analyses led us to uncover a common APP variant
association with PIQ in children, which was repli-
cated in AD in adults. We further found that this SNP
could influence APP expression by affecting TFCP2
binding affinity.
APP encodes the amyloid-� protein precursor
(A�PP) that forms A�-containing neuritic plaques,
the accumulation of which is one of the key
histopathological hallmarks in AD. While the role of
APP in AD has long been known, its involvement
in childhood intelligence has not been previously
reported. The association signal observed in this
study is between the APP and PIQ (Table 3), believed
to reflect fluid intelligence. Examining the data from
a recent large-scale GWAS on cognitive functions
(N = 112,151) [36], we noted that APP gene revealed
signs of association with reaction time (efficiency of
information processing) and memory (p = 0.048 and
0.095, respectively; Supplementary Figure 7), further
suggesting possible involvement of APP in cognition.
General fluid cognitive functioning in childhood
has been proposed to be linked to late-onset demen-
tia [37, 38], with genetic influences possibly being
the driving force behind stability of cognitive func-
tioning [39]. In a recent study, carriers of the APOE
ε4 variant (the best replicated known genetic factor
for AD) revealed correlation with working memory
and attention in children [40]. Thus, we hypothesize
that the genetics of PIQ may be an important deter-
minant of cognitive abilities throughout the lifespan
and of age-related dementia.
Genetic overlap between IQ and dementia has pre-
viously been reported in other studies, including a
large genome-wide analysis in over 100,000 individ-
uals [23]. Another GWAS on general fluid cognitive
ability in adults (N = 53,949) identified four genes
(namely TOMM40, APOE, ABCG1, and MEF2C)
previously associated with AD or neuropathological
features of AD and related dementias [11]. Such over-
lap has also been noted for the APP gene, where a
coding variant was shown to be protective against
both normal age-related cognitive decline and AD
 732
C. Myrum et al. / Implication of the APP Gene in Intellectual Abilities
[41]. While the APOE has shown robust association
with AD and normal cognitive aging, more in-depth
functional studies are needed to more thoroughly
understand the functional significance of all genetic
contributions of cognitive ability.
In this study, the most prominent significant signal
was noted in APP, between the intronic rs2830077
and PIQ in children, also showing association with
AD in adults (Table 3). In silico analyses of this SNP
prompted its functional evaluation after noting that
rs2830077: (1) is located within a region of active
chromatin; (2) may have transcriptional enhancer
activity in hippocampal tissue; (3) possesses eQTL
activity; and (4) is located at a putative TFCP2 bind-
ingsite.WeconfirmedviaEMSAthatTFCP2bindsto
this putative enhancer region, with rs2830077 allele-
specific binding affinity (Supplementary Figure 5).
Further, luciferase assays indicate that the C allele
of this SNP confers enhanced expression of APP
(Fig. 2). The TFCP2 transcription factor has been
implicated in erythroid gene expression [42], repres-
sion of HIV transcription [43], and in different cancer
types [44, 45]. No direct connections between TFCP2
and A�PP expression have been reported, though a
number of studies show association between TFCP2
gene and AD [46, 47]. The activity of TFCP2 itself
is regulated by A�PP-interacting protein Fe65 [48]
and the intracellular domain of APP-like protein 2
[49]. Another APP SNP (rs467021), in linkage dis-
equilibrium with rs2830077 (r2 = 0.99952), has been
reported to be associated with cognitive decline in
AD [50].
The dosage of A�PP has been implicated in altered
neuronal endocytosis associated with increased A�
production and age-related brain atrophy and degen-
eration, observed in patients with AD and Down
syndrome (DS) [51]. Furthermore, duplication of the
APP locus is thought to lead to early-onset AD [52]
and the trisomy of this locus is likely to contribute
to dementia in DS [53]. Indeed, the triplication of
the Hsa21 segment including APP in people with-
out DS has been associated with AD [53]. As both
AD and DS display dementia, the observed associa-
tion between PIQ and a SNP potentially altering the
expression of APP, and thus its dosage, may help to
elucidate the link between variation in intelligence
and development of dementia.
We should note that to better estimate the contri-
bution of genetics to IQ through life, examination
of longitudinal samples where IQ is measured at
early and late ages is desirable. However, since such
samples were not available, we took the alternative
approach of looking up significant child IQ associ-
ation signals (ALSPAC) in late adulthood (IGAP).
While our findings are intriguing, a direct replication
in an independent childhood sample is warranted.
In summary, this study implicates APP in general
cognitive abilities. We also show that evidence-based
pathway analyses can be useful in identifying genetic
factors underlying cognitive function. Follow-up
studies are needed to more precisely determine how
variants in APP may exert their effects on cogni-
tive function over a lifespan. Such studies may have
valuable implications for our understanding of etiol-
ogy and, eventually, treatment of disorders associated
with cognitive dysfunction, such as AD.
