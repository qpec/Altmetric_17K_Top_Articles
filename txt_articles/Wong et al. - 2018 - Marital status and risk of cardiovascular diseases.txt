background the influence of marital status on the 
incidence of cardiovascular disease (cVD) and prognosis 
after cVD is inconclusive. We systematically reviewed 
the literature to determine how marital status influences 
cVD and prognosis after cVD.
Methods a search of MeDline and embase in January 
2018 without language restriction was performed to 
identify studies that evaluated the association between 
marital status and risk of cVD. search terms related to 
both marital status and cVD were used and included 
studies had to be prospective in design. the outcomes 
of interest were cVD, coronary heart disease (chD) or 
stroke incidence and mortality. We performed random 
effects meta-analysis stratified by the types of population 
by calculating odds ratios (Or) and 95% confidence 
intervals (95% ci).
results Our analysis included 34 studies with more 
than two million participants. compared with married 
participants, being unmarried (never married, divorced 
or widowed) was associated with increased odds 
of cVD (Or 1.42; 95% ci 1.00 to 2.01), chD (Or 
1.16,95% ci 1.04 to 1.28), chD death (Or 1.43,95% 
ci 1.28 to 1.60) and stroke death (Or 1.55,95% 1.16 
to 2.08). Being divorced was associated with increased 
odds of chD (P<0.001) for both men and women 
while widowers were more likely to develop a stroke 
(P<0.001). single men and women with myocardial 
infarction had increased mortality (Or 1.42, 95% ci 1.14 
to 1.76) compared with married participants.
Conclusions Marital status appears to influence cVD 
and prognosis after cVD. these findings may suggest 
that marital status should be considered in the risk 
assessment for cVD and outcomes of cVD based on 
marital status merits further investigation.
InTroduCTIon
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality.1 In order to 
reduce the burden of CVD, there is great interest 
in identifying risk factors in the general population 
so that those deemed to be at high risk for future 
cardiovascular events can be targeted for interven-
tion. While 80% of the risk for future CVD can be 
predicted from known cardiovascular risk factors 
such as old age, male sex, hypertension, hyperlipi-
daemia, smoking and diabetes mellitus, the determi-
nants for the remaining 20% risk remain unclear.2
One factor which may be associated with 
CVD is marital status and studies have reported 
inconsistent findings. The benefits of marriage on 
health and mortality have been demonstrated for 
both sexes, in different ethnic groups and appear 
to be independent of various sociodemographic 
characteristics.3 4 Better prognosis in married 
individuals has been reported both after myocar-
dial infarction3 5–10 and stroke,11 12 whereas, other 
studies found no influence of marital status on risk 
of future CVD.13–15 In addition, sex differences 
have been observed where the degree of ‘protec-
tion’ conferred in men from being married tends to 
be greater.16 17 The interpretation of marital status 
and CVD becomes more complex with the addition 
of divorced and widowed groups.15 18–20
In view of these disparate findings reported in the 
literature, we conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of CVD based on 
marital status and the influence of marital status on 
prognosis after CVD.
MeThods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was 
conducted and reported according to the guidance 
of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA).21
eligibility criteria
We selected studies which evaluated cardiovas-
cular events or mortality in participants according 
to marital status. The included studies had at least 
two groups (married and unmarried, divorced or 
widowed) and followed participants for incident 
cardiovascular events or mortality outcome after 
incident CVD. Studies of patients with suspected 
coronary heart disease were also included but not 
pooled with other studies with myocardial infarc-
tion. Only prospective studies published since 
2000 were retained for analysis to limit issues 
related to quality of study reporting and general-
isability to contemporary clinical practice. There 
was no exclusion of studies based on the length of 
follow-up, language of publication or definition 
of cardiovascular events such as ischaemic heart 
disease, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarc-
tion and stroke. However, we excluded studies of 
heart failure, retrospective analyses, case–control 
studies and those studies which did not report the 
numerical association between marital status and 
outcome. Reviews were examined for additional 
studies that met the inclusion criteria.

search strategy
We searched MEDLINE and Embase from 2000 onwards using 
OVID SP with no date or language restriction. This search 
was last updated in January 2018. The exact free search terms 
were (‘marital status’ or ‘married’ or ‘unmarried’ or ‘widowed’ 
or ‘divorced’) AND (‘myocardial infarction’ or ‘acute coro-
nary syndrome’ or ‘coronary heart disease’ or ‘ischaemic heart 
disease’ or ‘ischaemic heart disease’ or ‘heart attack’ or ‘stroke’ 
or ‘cerebrovascular disease’ or ‘cerebrovascular accident’). We 
checked the bibliography of relevant studies and reviews for 
additional studies that met the inclusion criteria.
study selection process and data collection process
T
wo reviewers (CWW and CSK) independently screened all 
titles and abstracts retrieved from the search for studies that met 
the inclusion criteria. The full articles of studies that potentially 
met the inclusion criteria were reviewed and the final decision 
to include or exclude was made with the other reviewers. Inde-
pendent double extractions were performed by two reviewers 
(CWW and CSK) collecting data on study design, year, country, 
number of participants, mean age, % male, participant inclu-
sion criteria, comparison groups and results, while independent 
double extractions for quality assessment table were completed 
by CWW and another reviewer (AN).
risk of bias assessment
Quality assessment of the studies was conducted based on the 
recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic 
Review and previous published systematic reviews of observa-
tional studies.22
data analysis
We used Review Manager V
.5.3.5 (Nordic Cochrane Centre) to 
conduct random effects meta-analysis stratified by the type of 
population which were either general population, post stroke or 
post myocardial infarction and marital status. We used random 
effects because the studies were conducted in a wide range of 
settings in different populations, hence the need to take hetero-
geneity into account for the pooled effect estimate. Where 
possible, we chose to pool reported adjusted risk estimates from 
primary studies and when these data were not available, raw data 
were used to calculate unadjusted risk estimates. We used the I2 
statistic to assess statistical heterogeneity. I2 values of 30–60% 
represent moderate levels of heterogeneity and sensitivity anal-
ysis was performed to evaluate analyses with high statistical 
heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by asymmetry 
testing with funnel plots if there was no evidence of significant 
heterogeneity.23 Further subgroup analyses were performed to 
investigate the impact of sex differences combined with marital 
status on various cardiovascular outcomes. Further analyses 
were also performed with the exclusion of studies with unclear 
marital status ascertainment and another with the exclusion of 
studies with only crude results or unadjusted results available.

description of studies included in analysis
The process of study selection is shown in figure 1. After 
screening, 32 studies were retained for inclusion and two addi-
tional studies were identified from a review yielding a total of 
34 studies for analysis. Table 1 summarises the study designs 
and participant characteristics. These 34 studies, which took 
place in various countries including Russia, Denmark, Spain, 
USA, Sweden, UK, Canada, Israel, Gulf States, Japan, Finland, 
Greece, Turkey, Norway and China between 1963 and 2015. 
The follow-up period from these studies ranged from 30 days to 
34 years. There were more than 2 million participants (ranging 
from 135 to 7 
34 
626 participants). Data on age are available for 
1 137 571 participants from 25 studies with a mean of 58.4 
years 
(range 42 to 77 years). The definition of unmarried used in each 
study is presented in the online supplementary table 1.

Mortality in the general population
The results for the general population as well as by gender are 
summarised in tables 2-4 (and online supplementary table 2 and 
online supplementary figures 1–2 and 4–13). Compared with 
married participants, unmarried participants were more likely to 
die from both CHD (OR 1.43, 95% 
CI 1.28 to 1.60, I2=57%, 
P<0.001, n=5) and stroke (OR 1.55, 95% 
CI 1.16 to 2.08, 
I2=0%, P=0.003, n=2) (figure 2A and figure 2B).
Being divorced was associated with an increased odds of CHD 
mortality (OR 1.33, 95%

possible coronary artery disease or acutely following a myocar-
dial infarction, there was no significant difference in all-cause 
mortality in the unmarried, divorced and widowed groups when

dIsCussIon
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence synthesis 
to quantify the evidence base using meta-analysis to evaluate the 
relationship between marital status and cardiovascular disease. 
Our analysis showed that compared with married individuals, 
being unmarried was associated with increased CHD and both 
CHD and stroke mortality in the general population. Simi-
larly, we observed greater odds of death from CHD and stroke 
in divorced compared with married individuals. Finally, in the 
widowed population only stroke incidence was elevated with 
similar odds in both sexes. Our analysis also describes important 
differences in prognosis with regard to mortality according to 
marital status in patients with incident cardiovascular disease. In 
participants who suffered a myocardial infarction, being unmar-
ried was associated with greater odds of mortality compared with 
a married individual, with a non-significant trend in widowed 
or divorced individuals. In our analysis, no significant gender 
effect was observed for the association between marital status 
and developing CVD and death from CVD in any groups of 
participants, although differences in total mortality were noted.
We have built on the current understanding of marital status 
and adverse outcomes in several ways. First, a previous meta-anal-
ysis of 53 studies demonstrated higher all-cause mortality in 
never married, divorced and widowed married versus married 
individuals,41 but the study did not explore any specific causes of 
death or cardiovascular disease. A more recent review published 
by Manfredini et al describes the improved health status and 
reduced cardiovascular risk with married status but it did not 
quantify the relationships with meta-analysis.42 Our updated 
review with 34 studies has built on the findings of these reviews 
to quantify the relationship between marital status and CVD 
while considering the unmarried, divorced and widowed status 
of the populations assessed.

CVD, cardiovascular disease; MACE, major adverse cardiac events; MI, myocardial infarction.
Several mechanisms have been suggested to account for the 
observed protective effect of marital status on CVD, espe-
cially in men. Social causation theory suggests that individuals 
benefit from spousal support.43 For example, living with another 
person allows earlier recognition and response to warning symp-
toms,16 25 especially if a myocardial infarction becomes instantly 
disabling.25 Studies have reported that unmarried patients had 
longer delays in seeking medical help7 8 16 44 and longer total 
ischaemic times44 which directly influences both the timing and 
proportion of participants being treated with either thrombol-
ysis or invasive cardiac procedures that reduce mortality.7 8 In 
addition, spouses, particularly wives, encourage concordant 
health behaviour such as a healthy lifestyle13 16 19 45 and adher-
ence to treatment5 13 16 19 45 that promote cardiovascular health. 
In contrast, marital dissolution is noted to affect the health 
behaviour mentioned above negatively.29 Moreover, Wu et 
al reported that compared with married individuals, unmar-
ried individuals were twice more likely to be non-adherent to 
their prescribed medications which was the strongest predictor 
of better outcome in their study.45 There are greater financial 
resources, especially in households with a dual income, making 
better healthcare more accessible.13 16 30 Furthermore, one of the 
benefits of being married or with a partner may be increased 
participation in cardiac rehabilitation which improves outcomes 
after cardiovascular disease.46
Stress-related theory suggests that partner loss or poor-
quality relationships may have a negative impact on the 
economic, behavioural and emotional well-being of an indi-
vidual which may reduce one's ability to prevent, detect and 
treat illness.33 Biologically, stress may ultimately worsen 
cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, reduced 
heart rate variability, impaired vagal tone, hyperlipidaemia, 
diabetes and the progression of atherosclerosis.9 29 32 The 
buffering hypothesis suggests that informational or emotional 
resources from a spouse promote adaptive behaviour and may 
reduce excessive neuroendocrine response to acute or chronic 
stressors.17 35 This translates into a decrease in progression of 
atherosclerosis and other pathological processes, thus reducing 
the risk of CVD.
Furthermore, selection theory has been introduced which 
assumes that individuals with poor health are less likely to estab-
lish or maintain long-term relationships such as marriage.5 33 
Also, Floud et al suggested the possibility that healthy women 
may be less likely to divorce,13 although Akimova et al reported 
that divorced and single women were more highly educated and 
had a higher qualified occupation which results in greater finan-
cial independence and better quality of life.35
In widowed populations, there is less variation in CVD inci-
dence and mortality  between sexes with some studies showing 
women do more poorly than men. Vujcic et al showed that 
the proportion of women who lived alone increased with age 
while the proportion of men who lived alone decreased with 
age.9 Possible explanations include women tend to be younger 
than their husbands and have a longer life expectancy.9 Thus, it 
is postulated that widowed women tend to be older and more 
support is needed to meet their healthcare requirement. This 
study has several strengths and limitations. This is the largest 
study to date with a sample size of more than 2 million compared 
with the smaller sample sizes of previous reviews.41 42 We were 
able to quantify the risk with meta-analysis which was not 
performed in the previous studies.42 In terms of generalisability, 
the current review included populations from various age

groups, ethnicities and geographic locations making the findings 
generalisable to different populations. We used a comprehensive 
search strategy of the literature and excluded case-control and 
retrospective studies to reduce the possibility of bias. Finally, 
results with the greatest extent of adjustments were used for the 
analysis in this study.
The major limitation of this study is the inconsistent variable 
adjustments across studies, which poses a risk of confounding. 
Adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors was often incomplete 
in many of the studies analysed, which may have influenced 
our result. In addition, this review is not an individual patient

material. The lack of information on same-sex spouses and quality 
of marriage limit further insight into the impact of marriage. 
Moreover, heterogeneity exists across studies in terms of study 
methodology. For example, the definition of CVD varied across 
the studies and the follow-up period was inconsistent with some 
long-term studies (>15 years of follow-up) where management 
might have changed over time.7 19 20 30 36 37
Future work should focus on whether marital status is a surro-
gate marker of other adverse health behaviour or cardiovascular 
risk profiles that underlies our reported findings and whether 
targeted interventions should focus on such high-risk groups. 
The association between cohabitation/living with someone and 
CVD should be explored as it may be a confounding factor in 
this study. In Quinones et al, the replacement of marital status 
with cohabitation yielded the same protective effect although 
slightly less pronounced.33 Fournier et al suggested that having 
information of ‘living alone’ versus ‘living with someone’ instead 
of married versus not married would have been more useful.43
In conclusion, being married appears to be associated a lower 
cardiovascular mortality and incidence of CVD in a general 
population and mortality after myocardial infarction. While 
current evidence may demonstrate an association between 
marital status and mortality and CVD, lack of social support 
might be a mitigating factor. Future research should focus 
around whether marital status is a surrogate marker for other 
adverse health behaviour or cardiovascular risk profiles that 
underlies our reported findings, or whether marital status should 
be considered as a risk factor by itself.
Key questions
What is already known about this subject?
 
► While 80% of the risk for future cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
can be predicted from known cardiovascular risk factors 
such as hypertension, smoking and diabetes mellitus, the 
determinants for the remaining 20% risk remain unclear.
 
► One factor which may be associated with CVD is marital 
status and studies have reported inconsistent findings.
What does this study add?
 
► Our analysis showed that compared with married individuals, 
being unmarried was associated with increased all cause 
mortality, coronary heart disease (CHD) and both CHD and 
stroke mortality in the general population.
 
► Similarly, we observed a greater odds of death from CHD and 
stroke in divorced compared with married individuals.
 
► In the widowed population only stroke incidence was 
elevated with similar odds in both sexes.
how might this impact on clinical practice?
 
► These findings may suggest that marital status should be 
considered in the risk assessment for CVD.
