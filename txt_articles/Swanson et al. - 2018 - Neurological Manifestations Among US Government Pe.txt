IMPORTANCE From late 2016 through August 2017, US government personnel serving
on diplomatic assignment in Havana, Cuba, reported neurological symptoms associated
with exposure to auditory and sensory phenomena.
OBJECTIVE To describe the neurological manifestations that followed exposure to an
unknown energy source associated with auditory and sensory phenomena.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Preliminary results from a retrospective case series of
US government personnel in Havana, Cuba. Following reported exposure to auditory and
sensory phenomena in their homes or hotel rooms, the individuals reported a similar
constellation of neurological symptoms resembling brain injury. These individuals were
referred to an academic brain injury center for multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment.
EXPOSURES Report of experiencing audible and sensory phenomena emanating from a
distinct direction (directional phenomena) associated with an undetermined source, while
serving on US government assignments in Havana, Cuba, since 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Descriptions of the exposures and symptoms were
obtained from medical record review of multidisciplinary clinical interviews and
examinations. Additional objective assessments included clinical tests of vestibular (dynamic
and static balance, vestibulo-ocular reflex testing, caloric testing), oculomotor (measurement
of convergence, saccadic, and smooth pursuit eye movements), cognitive (comprehensive
neuropsychological battery), and audiometric (pure tone and speech audiometry)
functioning. Neuroimaging was also obtained.
RESULTS Of 24 individuals with suspected exposure identified by the US Department of State,
21 completed multidisciplinary evaluation an average of 203 days after exposure. Persistent
symptoms (>3 months after exposure) were reported by these individuals including cognitive
(n = 17, 81%), balance (n = 15, 71%), visual (n = 18, 86%), and auditory (n = 15, 68%)
dysfunction, sleep impairment (n = 18, 86%), and headaches (n = 16, 76%). Objective findings
included cognitive (n = 16, 76%), vestibular (n = 17, 81%), and oculomotor (n = 15, 71%)
abnormalities. Moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss was identified in 3 individuals.
Pharmacologic intervention was required for persistent sleep dysfunction (n = 15, 71%) and
headache (n = 12, 57%). Fourteen individuals (67%) were held from work at the time of
multidisciplinary evaluation. Of those, 7 began graduated return to work with restrictions in
place, home exercise programs, and higher-level work-focused cognitive rehabilitation.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this preliminary report of a retrospective case series,
persistent cognitive, vestibular, and oculomotor dysfunction, as well as sleep impairment and
headaches, were observed among US government personnel in Havana, Cuba, associated
with reports of directional audible and/or sensory phenomena of unclear origin. These
individuals appeared to have sustained injury to widespread brain networks without an
associated history of head trauma.

n late 2016, US government personnel serving in Havana,
Cuba, began presenting to their embassy medical unit
after experiencing unusual auditory and/or sensory
stimuli of variable intensity and character, with associated
onset of varied neurological manifestations. Initial signs and
symptoms pointed toward injury of the auditory system,
leading to the establishment of a triage program at the
University of Miami centered around otolaryngology evalua-
tion. Eighty embassy community members underwent
initial evaluation between February and April 2017, and 16
individuals were identified with similar exposure history
and a constellation of neurological signs and symptoms
commonly seen following mild traumatic brain injury, also
referred to as concussion.1 Exposures continued with time
and 8 additional individuals were identified who had similar
findings. The US Department of State, Bureau of Medical Ser-
vices, subsequently convened an expert panel in July 2017,
which came to consensus that the triage findings were most
likely related to neurotrauma from a nonnatural source and
recommended that further investigation into this novel clus-
ter of findings was necessary.
The University of Pennsylvania’
s Center for Brain Injury
and Repair was subsequently selected to coordinate multidis-
ciplinary clinical evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation of
individuals identified during initial triage and additional pa-
tients with exposure. The purpose of this preliminary com-
munication is to describe preliminary findings from 21 pa-
tients who were exposed to the same nonnatural source.1
Methods
Design
This retrospective study was approved by the institutional re-
viewboardoftheUniversityofPennsylvania’
sPerelmanSchool
of Medicine, which waived the need for informed consent.
The participants signed general consent forms for treatment
permitting use of their data in research. Because of security
and confidentiality considerations, individual-level demo-
graphic data cannot be reported.
Clinical Approach
The US Department of State directly referred individuals with
suspected exposure to the University of Pennsylvania for
comprehensive evaluation and treatment. A multidisci-
plinary team was convened consisting of physical medicine
and rehabilitation, occupational medicine, neurology, neuro-
radiology, and neurosurgery. Each specialist independently
obtained clinical histories and conducted comprehensive
assessments. Reported signs and symptoms were extracted
from these interviews.
Based on individual clinical indication, additional refer-
rals were made to vestibular physical therapy, neuro-
optometry, neuropsychology, occupational therapy, speech
therapy, audiology, otorhinolaryngology, and sleep medicine
for focused evaluation and treatment. Patients were referred
to the University of Pennsylvania for clinical care, as opposed
to enrollment in a structured research study. The Box shows
an abbreviated list of objective measures used during clinical
assessments and supplements for additional information.2-29
Cognitive, Neurobehavioral, and Mood Evaluations
When clinically indicated, comprehensive neuropsychologi-
cal assessments were conducted by experienced neuropsy-
chologists, who were not blinded to patient status. Neuro-
psychological test batteries included assessment of the
following domains: (1) auditory attention, (2) auditory and
visual working memory, (3) auditory and visual memory,
(4) visual-spatial perception, (5) visual-motor construction,
(6) motor function, (7) language function, (8) executive func-
tion, (9) processing speed, (10) academic achievement,
(11) reasoning, (12) mood functioning, and (13) effort (Box
and eAppendix in the Supplement). Following neuropsycho-
logical testing, individuals with cognitive deficits were
referred for cognitive rehabilitation with occupational
therapy, speech therapy, or both, depending on the indi-
vidual clinical indication. Cognitive rehabilitation was inten-
tionally not started prior to completion of neuropsychologi-
cal testing to avoid affecting results.
Balance and Vestibular Evaluations
Clinical evaluations identifying balance abnormalities
prompted referral to vestibular physical therapy. Focused
vestibular evaluation included expert clinical assessment and
the use of validated measures of static and dynamic balance
(Box).15-21 Also per clinical indications, patients were referred
to audiology for comprehensive evaluation of the peripheral
vestibular system, including caloric reflex testing.23,24 Indi-
viduals confirmed to have a unilateral peripheral vestibu-
lopathy (ie, relative vestibular reduction of ≥25% on caloric
reflex testing) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
of the head with and without gadolinium contrast, with
focus on the internal auditory canals in addition to the MRI
sequences detailed.
Oculomotor Evaluations
Individuals found on clinical evaluation to have abnormalities
of oculomotor function were referred to neuro-optometry for
further evaluation and treatment. Oculomotor function was
Key Points
Question Are there neurological manifestations associated with
reports of audible and sensory phenomena among US government
personnel in Havana, Cuba?
Findings In this case series of 21 individuals exposed to directional
audible and sensory phenomena, a constellation of acute and
persistent signs and symptoms were identified, in the absence of
an associated history of blunt head trauma. Following exposure,
patients experienced cognitive, vestibular, and oculomotor
dysfunction, along with auditory symptoms, sleep abnormalities,
and headache.
Meaning The unique circumstances of these patients and the
consistency of the clinical manifestations raised concern for a
novel mechanism of a possible acquired brain injury from a
directional exposure of undetermined etiology.

 quantified using the following standard optometric clinical
measures (Box).25,26 Vergence testing included step vergence
with prism bar, vergence facility with prisms, and near point
of convergence. Accommodative testing in nonpresbyopic pa-
tients included amplitude of accommodation, accommoda-
tive facility with plus and minus lenses, and accommodative
lag. Pursuit and saccadic testing was done qualitatively to
assess accuracy of tracking eye movements and whether
symptoms were provoked as with Vestibular/Ocular Motor
Screening.29 Saccadic speed and accuracy were quantified
using the Developmental Eye Movement test,26,28 a timed
visual-verbal test. Diagnoses of accommodative, vergence,
and/or saccadic/pursuit dysfunction were made using stan-
dardizedcriteria,inconjunctionwithsymptomaticreporting,26
which were quantified using the Convergence Insufficiency
Symptoms Survey.27
Auditory Evaluations
Audiometry evaluations were performed prior to referral for
care at the University of Pennsylvania. However, when pa-
tients had balance function testing as described here, com-
prehensive audiology evaluation included both pure tone and
speech audiometry.
Imaging Evaluations
Initial conventional MRI sequences were acquired at 3T on
a Siemens Magnetom Prismafit scanner, and included high-
resolution sagittal 3-dimensional MP-RAGE, T2 SPACE and
FLAIR SPACE, coronal 2-dimensional T2-weighted imaging,
axial 2-dimensional diffusion-weighted imaging, and axial T2*
gradient echo. Resulting images were clinically interpreted
by neuroradiology clinicians.
Results
There were 21 individuals evaluated (11 women and 10 men,
with a mean age of 43 years). Multidisciplinary evaluations be-
gananaverageof203days(range,3-331days;median,189days;
interquartile range, 125 days) following exposure (Table 1).
Exposure
For 18 of the 21 individuals (86%), there were reports of hear-
ing a novel, localized sound at the onset of symptoms in their
homes and hotel rooms (Table 2). Affected individuals de-
scribedthesoundsasdirectional,intenselyloud,andwithpure
andsustainedtonality.Ofthepatients,high-pitchedsoundwas
reported by 16 (76%), although 2 (10%) noted a low-pitched
sound. Words used to describe the sound include “buzzing,”
“grinding metal,” “piercing squeals,” and “humming.”
The sounds were often associated with pressurelike
(n = 9, 43%) or vibratory (n = 3, 14%) sensory stimuli, which
were also experienced by 2 of the 3 patients who did not hear
a sound. The sensory stimuli were likened to air “baffling” in-
side a moving car with the windows partially rolled down.
Both the sound and sensory stimuli were often described
as directional in that the individuals perceived a distinct di-
rection from which the sensation emanated (hereafter re-
ferred to as directional phenomena). Further, the directional
phenomena appeared to be localized to a precise area, as in-
dividuals (n = 12, 57%) noted that after changing location, the
sensation disappeared and the associated symptoms re-
duced. Five individuals (24%) reported covering their head
and/or ears, although doing so did not result in attenuation of
the directional phenomena.
Accurately determining the dose and duration of expo-
sure has been difficult because of the limitations of patient
recall. Some patients were awakened by sounds and were
unsure of the start of the event. The shortest reported event
involved two 10-second pulses reported as a single exposure
episode, whereas other patients reported that they perceived
sound continuously for longer than 30 minutes. Owing to
security concerns, further details of potential dosage cannot
be provided.
Of the affected individuals, 20 (95%) reported immedi-
ate onset of neurological symptoms associated with direc-
tional phenomena (eTable 1 in the Supplement). One indi-
vidual awoke from sleep with acute symptoms (including
headache, unilateral ear pain, and hearing changes) but did not
perceive directional phenomena. From days to weeks after ex-
posure, individuals reported that they experienced the onset

 of additional cognitive, neurobehavioral/mood, and physical
symptoms. Twenty individuals (95%) reported that they ex-
perienced persistent (>3 months) symptoms, and 18 individu-
als (86%) exhibited objective clinical manifestations in 6 pre-
dominant domains (Table 3).
Cognitive, Neurobehavioral, and Mood Findings
Persistent cognitive manifestations were reported by 17 indi-
viduals (81%). Subjective symptoms included memory prob-
lems (n = 16, 76%), feeling mentally foggy (n = 16, 76%), im-
paired concentration (n = 15, 71%), and feeling cognitively
slowed (n = 14, 67%) (Table 3). In addition, they reported neu-
robehavioraldifficultiesincludingirritability(n = 14,67%),ner-
vousness (n = 12, 57%), feeling more emotional (n = 11, 52%),
andsadness(n = 5,24%).Foratleast6individuals(29%),aclear
changeinworkperformancewasnotedbysupervisorsandcol-
leagues (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Individuals also re-
ported a “good day–bad day” pattern where significant cog-
nitive or physical exertion would be followed by exacerbation
of their symptoms for several days. Cognitive symptoms, as
well as disequilibrium and headache, reportedly were also fre-
quently exacerbated by cardiovascular exercise.
Multidisciplinary evaluations raised concern for cogni-
tive impairment in 16 individuals (76%). Prior to referral, 4 of
these individuals underwent neuropsychological evaluation
(data not shown as generated outside of the University of
Pennsylvania). Repetition of comprehensive neuropsycho-
logical testing is precluded within 1 year due of practice
effects when material is presented within this timeframe.
With previous exposure to material, the individual may score
higher on a repeated neuropsychological evaluation within 1
year. Neuropsychological assessments were performed on 10
individuals after referral. Of those, interpretation was ongo-
ing in 4 at the time of this publication. Per their preference, 2
individuals did not complete neuropsychological testing.
For the 6 individuals with complete neuropsychological
testing data and analysis at the University of Pennsylvania,
all had significant areas of cognitive weakness and/or impair-
ment (eTables 2, 3, and 4 in the Supplement). Impairments
were found in executive function (n = 6), motor function
(n = 5), auditory and visual memory (n = 4), visual-spatial
perception and visual-motor construction (n = 4), auditory
attention and working memory (n = 3), language (n = 3), pro-
cessing speed (n = 4), and reasoning (n = 1). All individuals

 demonstrated a high level of effort during testing and had
intact cognitive domains including visual working memory
and academic achievement.
Neurobehavioral function was evaluated using the Frontal
System Behavior Scale, a self-report measure of frontal lobe
dysfunction. Specifically, comparing before and after expo-
sure retrospectively via patient recall and self-report, indi-
vidualsnotedapathy(n = 5),executivedysfunction(n = 4),and
disinhibition (n = 2). Two individuals met criteria for post-
traumatic stress disorder and endorsed severe levels of anger
on the Brief Mood Survey, 1 of whom also endorsed moderate
to severe levels of depression and anxiety.
Balance and Vestibular Findings
Individuals described acute nausea (n = 7, 33%) and dizziness
(n = 5, 24%) during exposure, which continued to progress
in the subacute and persistent stages (acute stage = during
or hours following exposure; subacute stage = days to weeks
after exposure patient recall]; and persistent stage = more
than 3 months after exposure). Specifically, more than
3 months after exposure, individuals reported a higher
prevalence of dizziness (n = 13, 62%) and nausea (n = 7, 33%),
in addition to general balance problems (n = 14, 67%)
(Table 3). These symptoms were exacerbated by walking
quickly, tasks involving head movements, complex visual
environments, or in some cases while simply standing still.
Balance symptoms were also worsened with eyes closed or in
low light conditions.
Clinical examinations raised concern for balance impair-
mentin17patients(81%),promptingreferraltovestibularphysi-
cal therapy. Focused vestibular evaluations demonstrated im-
pairments in static postural stability (n = 16, 76%), dynamic

 balance (n = 16, 76%), and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (n = 15,
71%) (eTables 5, 6, and 7 in the Supplement). Patients with the
mostseverebalanceimpairmentsonclinicalevaluationunder-
went caloric reflex testing, which demonstrated peripheral
vestibular dysfunction in 4 of 13 patients evaluated. MRI find-
ings focusing on the internal auditory canals on these 4 pa-
tients were normal. Taken together, these balance symptoms
andevaluationfindingsareconsistentwithcentraland,insome
cases, peripheral vestibular abnormalities.
Oculomotor Findings
Of the individuals with persistent symptoms, 16 (76%) re-
ported visual problems (Table 3). Light sensitivity (n = 13, 62%)
and difficulty reading (n = 12, 57%) were also frequently re-
ported. Eye strain (n = 11, 52%) was experienced particularly
with reading and was associated with headaches, disequilib-
rium, and nausea.
Clinical examinations raised concern for oculomotor dys-
function in 15 individuals (71%), prompting referral to neuro-
optometry. The most common findings confirmed on focused
oculomotor evaluation were convergence insufficiency (n = 11,
52%),abnormalsmoothpursuits(n = 11,52%),andsaccadicdys-
function(n = 10,47%)(eTables8and9intheSupplement).Simi-
lar to vestibular testing that provoked symptoms, oculomotor
examination elicited headache and disequilibrium.
Auditory Findings
At the onset of the directional phenomena, affected individu-
alsreportedhearingaloudsound(n = 18,86%),associatedwith
ear pain (n = 7,33%) and tinnitus (n = 6, 29%). Within days to
weeks following exposure, individuals continued to report tin-
nitus (n = 12, 57%) and ear pain (n = 5, 24%), with the addi-
tion of a change in hearing (n = 7, 33%) and sensitivity to noise
(n = 5, 24%). More than 3 months after exposure, sound sen-
sitivity was the most common auditory concern (n = 14, 67%),
followedbytinnitus(n = 12,57%)andearpressure(n = 8,38%).
While 9 individuals (43%) reported persistent hearing re-
duction, pure tone audiometry, including pure tone average
and word identification, revealed moderate to severe senso-
rineural hearing loss in 3 individuals (23%) (eTable 10 in the
Supplement), who were fitted with hearing aids. For 2 indi-
viduals, the moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss was
unilateral and corresponded with the side of peripheral ves-
tibular dysfunction on caloric testing. Otoscopy and tympa-
nometry findings were unremarkable.
Sleep
Individualscommonlyreportedissueswithsleep(n = 18,86%),
including reduced sleep duration (n = 15, 71%) and difficulty
falling asleep (n = 14, 67%). In addition, individuals experi-
enced significant daytime fatigue (n = 16, 76%). Most indi-
vidualsrequiredpharmacologicalinterventiontoimprovesub-
jective report of sleep architecture (n = 15, 71%) (eTable 11 in
the Supplement).
Headaches
At the initiation of directional phenomena exposure, 8 indi-
viduals (38%) reported immediate onset of headache, while 5
(24%) reported intense head pressure. In the days to weeks fol-
lowing exposure, 17 individuals (81%) developed headaches,
with 16 (76%) experiencing persistent headaches longer than
3 months after exposure (Table 3).
In the persistent stage, headaches were reported to be ex-
acerbated or associated with cognitive tasks (n = 13, 62%), re-
habilitative therapies (n = 11, 52%), photophobia (n = 9, 43%),
and phonophobia (n = 6, 29%). Patients with antecedent head-
aches were able to differentiate the character of these head-
aches from that of their standard headaches. Headaches were
generally reported to improve with medications (n = 12, 57%)
and appropriate therapies for oculomotor and vestibular im-
pairments (eTable 11 in the Supplement).
Imaging
MRI neuroimaging was obtained in all 21 patients. Most
patients had conventional imaging findings, which were
within normal limits, at most showing a few small nonspe-
cific T2-bright foci in the white matter (n =9, 43%). There
were 3 patients with multiple T2-bright white matter foci,
which were more than expected for age, 2 mild in degree,
and 1 with moderate changes. The pattern of conventional
imaging findings in these cases was nonspecific with regard
to the exposure/insult experienced, and the findings could
perhaps be attributed to other preexisting disease processes
or risk factors. Advanced structural and functional neuroim-
aging studies are ongoing.
Rehabilitation and Return to Work
Individualized rehabilitation programs were developed,
which included combinations of neuro-optometric rehabili-
tation (n = 14, 67%), vestibular physical therapy (n = 17, 81%),
and cognitive rehabilitation with speech pathology and/or
occupational therapy (n = 13, 62%). The most symptomatic
patients (n = 14, 67%) requiring multiple therapies did not
return to work.
Vestibular physical therapy sessions focused on balance
retraining, static and dynamic posture control with substitu-
tion via visual and somatosensory systems, gaze stabiliza-
tion exercises, habituation, smooth pursuits, and saccadic eye
movement exercises. Patients treated with vestibular reha-
bilitation have demonstrated a positive response with im-
proved balance and reduction of disequilibrium.
Formal neuro-optometric rehabilitation, including ma-
nipulation of disparity vergence and accommodative ampli-
tude and latency, has been used to treat ocular motor defi-
cits. Rehabilitation for abnormal smooth pursuit and saccadic
dysfunction was coordinated between neuro-optometric re-
habilitation, vestibular physical therapy, and occupational
therapy. Vestibular physical therapy focused on oculomotor
function with the body in motion and occupational therapy
emphasized functional tasks such as visual scanning in a simu-
lated work environment.
Following comprehensive neuropsychological testing,
a formal cognitive rehabilitation program was initiated in the
form of occupational therapy and/or speech therapy.

Discussion
Preliminary findings are described of a case series of indi-
viduals stationed in Havana, Cuba, nearly all of whom re-
porteddirectionalaudibleand/orsensoryphenomenathatwas
followed by the development of a consistent cluster of neu-
rological signs and symptoms. The clinical manifestations
may represent a novel clinical entity, which appears to have
resulted from a widespread brain network dysfunction
(ie, cognitive, oculomotor, and central vestibular) as seen
in mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion,30 as well as in-
jury to the peripheral vestibular system in some cases. It is
currently unclear if or how the noise is related to the re-
ported symptoms. In particular, sound in the audible range
(20 Hz-20 000 Hz) is not known to cause persistent injury to
thecentralnervoussystemandthereforethedescribedsounds
may have been associated with another form of exposure.
Cognitive symptoms, including difficulty remembering
(n=16, 76%) and feeling cognitively slowed (n=14, 67%) were
the most problematic for individuals in this series more than
3monthsafterexposure,withneuropsychologicaltestingiden-
tifying impairments in at least 1 cognitive domain in all 6 pa-
tients who completed neuropsychological evaluation to date
(eTables 2, 3, and 4 in the Supplement). Cognitive difficulties
interfered with these patients’ability to multitask, process in-
formationquicklywithaccuraterecall,solveproblems,andper-
form rapid decision making. Compared with vestibular and
oculomotor impairments, cognitive impairments are often
the slowest to improve following acquired brain injury,
which was observed in this series. Therefore, extended cog-
nitive rehabilitation with emphasis on return to work was
used. In addition, it is not uncommon for patients with neu-
rologicalinjuryresultingincognitiveimpairmenttohavemood
disturbances such as depression, anxiety, and/or posttrau-
matic stress disorder. Mood dysfunction can directly result
from acquired brain injury or develop in response to the pre-
cipitating event and novel deficits.31-33
The presence of subjective neurological symptoms pre-
senting in a cohesive community has raised concerns for col-
lective delusional disorders, including mass psychogenic ill-
ness. However, neurological examination and cognitive
screens did not reveal evidence of malingering, and objective
testing and behavioral observations during cognitive testing
indicated high levels of effort and motivation. Several of the
objective manifestations consistently found in this cohort
(such as oculomotor and vestibular testing abnormalities)
could not have been consciously or unconsciously manipu-
lated. Furthermore, mass psychogenic illness is often associ-
ated with transient, benign symptoms with rapid onset and
recovery often beginning with older individuals.34,35 In con-
trast, the Havana cohort experienced persisting disability of
a significant nature and are broadly distributed in age. Rather
than seeking time away from the workplace, the patients
were largely determined to continue to work or return to full
duty, even when encouraged by health care professionals
to take sick leave.
While not systematically excluded, viral etiologies, chemi-
cal etiologies, or both associated with acute onset of persis-
tent neurological impairment and peripheral vestibulopathy
with the directional nature of exposure descriptions are not
readily apparent. No other manifestations of viral illness, such
as preceding fever, were identified. It is unlikely a chemical
agent could produce these neurological manifestations in the
absence of other organ involvement, particularly given that
some individuals developed symptoms within 24 hours of ar-
riving in Havana.
There are important considerations in this investigation.
In particular, the anatomic substrates causing the symptoms
have not yet been identified. This may represent a significant
challenge because even the designation of “concussion,
” is not
yet a true diagnosis, as no definitions include the underlying
cause. Nonetheless, there is an emerging consensus that con-
cussion, or mild traumatic brain injury, is a type of brain net-
work disorder, based on classic symptoms (eg, slowed pro-
cessing speed and memory dysfunction) as well as changes in
the white matter tracts and consecutive connectivity, as de-
tected with advanced neuroimaging studies.30,36
Beyond the absence of blunt head trauma, there were ad-
ditional notable differences between the manifestations ob-
served in the Havana cohort and characteristic acute and per-
sistent symptoms of concussion. For example, individuals
experiencedunilateralearpainandtinnitusafterexposure,and
some were later detected to have a unilateral peripheral ves-
tibulopathy (along with central vestibular dysfunction), a find-
ing uncommon in concussion. Further, studies have reported
that while most individuals following concussion have a rela-
tively rapid full recovery, at least 15% are thought to experi-
encecharacteristicpersistingsymptoms.37,38Incontrasttoclas-
sic concussions, most patients referred following suspected
exposure in Havana exhibited significant impairment that per-
sisted for months with no significant improvement in mul-
tiple cases until rehabilitation was initiated.
For practicing clinicians, if a patient presents reporting a
similar potential exposure and symptoms similar to those
observed in mild traumatic brain injury, in addition to a thor-
ough history, objective evaluation should include screening
assessments of vestibular, oculomotor, and cognitive func-
tioning. Based on findings of this assessment, appropriate
referrals to subspecialists should be considered including
neurorehabilitation physiatry, vestibular physical therapy,
neuro-optometry, neuropsychology, and audiology.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, due to the sensitive
nature of this publication, certain details typically reported
in a case series of exposure were omitted, including specifics
about geography, relationships between individuals, and
individual demographics. Second, because these patients’
first evaluation was elsewhere, each patient did not undergo
each of the tests described. In particular, neuropsychological
characterization was incomplete at the time of publication.

 Preliminary results were presented given the importance
and strong public interest in this case series. Third, the reha-
bilitative course of this Havana cohort may not be represen-
tative because this represents a referral population. There
may be additional individuals exposed while in Havana,
Cuba, who have not been identified due to subtler manifes-
tations that either resolved spontaneously or did not prompt
presentation for medical treatment. Therefore, the actual
number of individuals exposed is unknown, and the relative
“dose” of exposure that causes acute and chronic symptoms
remains unclear.
Conclusions
In this preliminary report of a retrospective case series, per-
sistent cognitive, vestibular, and oculomotor dysfunction, as

US government personnel in Havana, Cuba, associated with
reports of directional audible and/or sensory phenomena of
