Summary
Background People with mental illness and substance use disorder are over-represented in prisons. Injury-related 
mortality is elevated in people released from prison, and both mental illness and substance use disorder are risk 
factors for injury. Effective care coordination during the transition between criminal justice and community service 
providers improves health outcomes for people released from prison. However, the health outcomes and support 
needs of people with dual diagnosis (co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorder) released from prison 
are poorly understood. Here we aim to examine the association between dual diagnosis and non-fatal injury in adults 
released from prison.
Methods Pre-release interview data collected between Aug 1, 2008, and July 31, 2010, from a representative sample of 
sentenced adults (≥18 years) in Queensland, Australia, were linked, retrospectively and prospectively, to person-level, 
state-wide emergency department and hospital records. We identified dual diagnoses from inpatient, emergency 
department, and prison medical records. We modelled the association between mental health status and all injury 
resulting in hospital contact by fitting a multivariate Cox regression, adjusting for sociodemographic, health, and 
criminogenic covariates, and replacing missing covariate data by multiple imputation.
Findings In 1307 adults released from prison, there were 2056 person-years of follow-up (median 495 days, 
IQR 163–958). The crude injury rates were 996 (95% CI 893–1112) per 1000 person-years for the dual diagnosis group, 
538 (441–657) per 1000 person-years for the mental illness only group, 413 (354–482) per 1000 person-years for the 
substance use disorder only group, and 275 (247–307) per 1000 person-years for the no mental disorder group. After 
adjusting for model covariates, the dual diagnosis (adjusted hazard rate ratio 3·27, 95% CI 2·30–4·64; p<0·0001) and 
mental illness only (1·87, 1·19–2·95; p=0·0071) groups were at increased risk of injury after release from prison 
compared with the group with no mental health disorders.
Interpretation People released from prison experience high rates of injury compared with the general population. 
Among people released from prison, dual diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of injury. Contact with the 
criminal justice system is a key opportunity to prevent subsequent injury morbidity in people with co-occurring 
mental health disorders. Engagement with integrated psychiatric and addiction treatment delivered without 
interruption during the transition from prison into the community might prevent the injury-related disparities 
experienced by this vulnerable group. The development of targeted injury prevention strategies for people with dual 
diagnosis released from prison is warranted.

Introduction
Injury is a major cause of death and morbidity globally.1,2 
In Australia, injury accounts for 9% of the total health 
burden3 and is the principal diagnosis in 25·2% of all 
emergency department presentations4 and 6·4% of all 
hospital admissions,5 representing substantial public 
expenditure. Although the rate of injury-related mortality 
is elevated in people recently released from prison,6 non-
fatal injury requiring hospital contact is more common 
than fatal injury and carries a risk of enduring morbidity.7 
However, studies of non-fatal injury in people released 
from prison are scarce and have mostly been restricted to 
non-fatal overdose8 and self-harm.9
Mental illness and substance use disorder are the 
leading causes of non-fatal burden of disease globally,10 
and are risk factors for injury.11 Determinants of social 
exclusion such as homelessness, unemployment, and 
multimorbidity have been shown to interact and 
exacerbate the risk of injury mortality among people who 
experience incarceration.12 The co-occurrence of mental 
illness and substance use disorder is often described as 
dual diagnosis.13 The prevalence of dual diagnosis is high

among people in prison, ranging from 18% to 56%.14,15 
When compared with people with mental illness only, 
substance use disorder only, or those without any mental 
disorder, a dual diagnosis has been associated with 
increased risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, 
interpersonal violence, hospitalisation, traumatic brain 
injury, poorer treatment outcomes, criminal justice 
system involve 
ment, and premature death.16,17 Evidence 
suggests that mental disorders are common causes of 
hospitalisation following release from prison.18 An 
Australian data-linkage study19 found that mental 
disorders and injury were the two most prevalent causes 
of hospital admission after release from prison, and 
accounted for most bed-days and total costs.
Recently, National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the UK have highlighted 
the profound scarcity of evidence on the physical health 
and support needs of people with dual diagnosis in the 
criminal justice system, and how this impedes effective 
care coordination during the transition between criminal 
justice and community service providers.20,21 Improved 
understanding of the clinical needs of people with dual 
diagnosis released from prison is therefore a key research 
priority.22 However, the relationship between dual 
diagnosis and injury in people released from prison 
remains poorly understood.
In a large, representative cohort of adults released from 
prison in Queensland, Australia, we aimed to determine 
three key things: (1) the association between dual diagnosis 
and injury; (2) rates of drug-related and other-cause injury 
over time and by mental health status; and (3) the clinical 
characteristics of hospital contacts for injury.
Methods
Study population
We used cohort data from the Passports study,23 a 
randomised controlled trial of a service brokerage 
intervention for people released from prison. The sample 
is representative of adults released from prison in 
Queensland in terms of demographic and criminal justice 
variables, except that women were intentionally over-
sampled to increase power for sex-stratified analyses.23
Briefly, 1325 sentenced adult (≥18 years) prisoners were 
administered a baseline interview within 6 weeks of 
their expected release from one of seven prisons in 
Queensland between Aug 1, 2008, and July 31, 2010.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a title and abstract search of PubMed for papers 
published up to Nov 30, 2017, using the following search terms: 
prison* OR ex-prison* OR offend* OR jail OR gaol OR custod* 
AND injur* OR accident* OR assault* OR self-harm* OR “self 
harm*” OR overdos* OR poison* OR hospital* OR emergenc* OR 
trauma* OR fracture* OR wound* OR burn* OR “toxic effects” 
AND “dual diagnos*” OR co-occur* OR comorbid*. Our search 
yielded 115 results. After removing duplicates, 114 potential 
articles were identified. We excluded articles that were not 
peer-reviewed (n=1), were not written in English (n=8), did not 
examine the relationship between dual diagnosis (co-occurring 
mental illness and substance use disorder) and injury (n=42), 
and were not conducted in adults released from prison (n=63). 
After full-text screening, no study fulfilled our inclusion criteria. 
Two prior studies have examined the association between dual 
diagnosis and a history of suicide attempts or ideation in adults 
in prison. These studies had no specific focus on injury or 
outcomes after release from prison. Three prior studies have 
investigated the relationship between dual diagnosis and 
emergency department presentation or hospitalisation in adults 
released from prison. However, none of these studies 
disaggregated by cause of the hospital contact. Our literature 
search indicated that no study has explicitly investigated the 
relationship between dual diagnosis and injury in adults released 
from prison and, thus, it remains poorly understood.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the 
association between dual diagnosis and injury in a 
representative sample of adults released from prison. Using a 
unique combination of baseline survey, prison medical records, 
and person-level, prospectively linked administrative data, 
we have shown that adults released from prison are at high risk 
of injury. Compared with those without a mental health 
disorder, we found that people with dual diagnosis had a three-
times higher risk of injury, with a rate of injury resulting in 
hospital admission that is 12 times higher than in the general 
population. Importantly, our study provides evidence that 
adults with dual diagnosis are disproportionately at risk of 
drug-related injury within the first 30 days after release from 
prison, accounting for eight out of ten drug-related injuries in 
our cohort within this period. However, we also found that the 
burden of preventable injury after release from prison is 
principally due to causes other than drug overdose, even in 
adults with substance use disorder or dual diagnosis. 
Furthermore, our findings provide evidence that people 
released from prison with dual diagnosis might be at risk of 
more severe injuries compared with those with mental illness 
only, substance use disorder only, or no mental disorder.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings show the extent and the time-dependent risk of 
injury in adults released from prison and highlight the 
disproportionate risk of injury in adults with dual diagnosis in 
an already highly marginalised population. Our results can be 
used to target scarce clinical resources to those at greatest risk 
of injury, and in time periods when this risk is greatest, after 
release from prison. Furthermore, our findings indicate a need 
for systemic changes to ensure greater continuity of care 
between forensic and community services, and foster deeper 
integration between mental health and addiction services.

The prison sentence during which participants were 
recruited is hereafter referred to as the index prison 
sentence. Informed, written consent was obtained from 
all participants.
The study was approved by the University of 
Queensland Behavioural and Social Sciences Ethical 
Review Committee (#2007000607), Queensland Health 
Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/11/QHC/40), 
and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Ethics 
Committee (EC2012/4/58).
Baseline measures
Self-report measures at baseline included sex; age; 
Indigenous status; relationship status (stable or un-
stable); years of school completed (<10 or ≥10); social 
visits in prison in the past month (none or at least one); 
participation in transitional programmes such as brief 
financial, health-care, or employment case management 
prior to release from prison (yes or no); pre-incarceration 
accommodation (stable or unstable); pre-incarceration 
employment status (employed or unemployed); and 
history of juvenile detention (yes or no).
Validated screening tools administered at baseline 
included the Hayes Ability Screening Index24 for 
identification of probable intellectual disability; the 
Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)25 for predicting 
severe mental illness; the Alcohol, Smoking and 
Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST)26 
for ascertaining harmful substance use; the Patient 
Activation Measure (PAM)27 for measuring capacity to 
self-manage health care; the Enriched Social Support 
Inventory28 to quantify perceived social support; and the 
Short-Form 36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2),29 from 
which we derived the physical component summary 
(PCS) score, a standardised measure of physical health-
related functioning and quality of life. Further detail on 
measures is provided in the appendix (p 1).
Health records
Prison medical records were coded by two trained 
graduate researchers using the International Classification 
of Primary Care, second edition (ICPC-2),30 which codes 
for problems and diagnoses managed, date of contact, and 
type of health professional seen.
Baseline data were probabilistically linked, retro-
spectively and prospectively, to person-level, state-wide 
emergency department and hospital records. Variables 
obtained from emergency department records included 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, 
Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM)31 diagnosis code 
(representing the principal discharge diagnosis), triage 
category,32 time and date of emergency department 
arrival and departure, departure destination, and 
departure status. Length of stay was calculated as the 
total time between arrival and departure timestamps. 
Variables obtained from hospital records included 
primary and secondary diagnoses (up to 20 were coded), 
external cause of morbidity ICD-10-AM codes, dates 
of admission and discharge, and number of hospital 
bed-days.
From deterministic linkage with correctional records, 
we obtained data on prior adult prison sentences 
(first or repeat), length of index prison sentence 
(<90 days, 90–365 days, or >365 days), parole on release 
(yes or no), risk of re-offending score (from a screening 
tool administered by corrections), and dates of reincar-
ceration during follow-up. Deaths during follow-up were 
identified through probabilistic linkage with the National 
Death Index.
Emergency department records were linked from 
June 1, 2002, to July 31, 2012, and hospital records were 
linked from July 1, 1999, to July 31, 2012; the starting 
dates were chosen on the basis of when data from these 
sources began to be recorded in a consistent and robust 
manner. Correctional records included all prison 
admissions and releases from Sept 1, 2008, to 
Dec 31, 2013. Death records were linked from the date of 
index prison release to May 31, 2013. Follow-up was 
censored at July 31, 2012, to ensure complete coverage of 
all data sources.
For the observation period prior to, and time spent in 
prison during the index prison sentence, we used 
ICD-10-AM codes to identify emergency department 
presentations and hospital admissions in which mental 
illness (F01–09 and F20–99) or a substance use disorder 
(F10–19) was recorded as a primary or secondary 
diagnosis.31 Diagnoses of both mental illness and 
substance use disorder in the same hospital admission 
or emergency department presentations for mental 
illness and substance use disorder, respectively, were 
considered evidence of dual diagnosis.
We used ICPC-2 codes to identify prison health service 
contacts in which a general practitioner, psychologist, or 
psychiatrist had made a diagnosis of mental illness 
(P70–76, P79–82, P86–98, and P99) or substance use 
disorder (P15, P18, and P19).30 A diagnosis of both mental 
illness and substance use disorder during the index 
prison sentence was considered evidence of dual 
diagnosis.
We aggregated pre-release ICD-10-AM diagnoses and 
ICPC-2 diagnoses in prison to create a composite 
exposure variable with exclusive categories for no mental 
disorder, substance use disorder only, mental illness 
only, and dual diagnosis.
We ascertained prescribed and illicit drug-related 
poisoning events from emergency department diagnoses 
and from primary and secondary hospital diagnoses 
(appendix p 3). We categorised the body region and 
nature of injury using the Barell Injury Diagno 
sis Matrix33 
(appendix p 4). We identified traumatic brain injury 
using a standard set of ICD-10-AM codes (appendix p 5). 
We ascertained external cause of in 
jury codes (V00–36) 
for each injury-related hos 
pital admission according to 
ICD-10-AM subchapter groupings (appendix p 6).5

Outcomes
The primary outcome was hospital contact (ie, 
emergency 
department 
presentation 
or 
hospital 
admission) for all injury (ICD-10-AM codes S00–99, 
T00–79, and T89) after release from prison. We included 
all emergency depart 
ment presentations with external 
cause of injury ICD-10-AM codes, and injuries from 
both principal and secondary diagnoses in hospital 
records in our definition of injury. Further information 
regarding our definition of injury is provided in the 
appendix (p 1).
Statistical analyses
We compared crude differences between mental health 
exposure groups at baseline using χ² tests for categorical 
measures and unadjusted linear regression for con-
tinuous measures.
We calculated crude incidence rates of injury during 
all follow-up and piecewise for 0–30 days, 31–90 days, 
91–180 days, 181–365 days, and 1–2 years after release 
from prison, separately for each mental health exposure 
group. Time at risk started on the date the participant 
was released from their index prison sentence and 
was censored at reincarceration, date of death, or the 
last day of the study observation period, whichever 
occurred first.
We modelled the association between pre-release 
mental health status and recurrent injury by fitting a 
multivariate Cox regression using the Andersen-Gill 
model,34 an extension that accommodates multiple event 
data. We modelled the underlying distribution by fitting 
a flexible parametric survival model.35 Models were 
adjusted for sex, age, Indigenous status, years of 
school completed, relationship status, accommodation, 
employment 
status, 
participation 
in 
transitional 
programmes, intellectual disability, K10 score, ASSIST 
scores (for alcohol, methamphetamine, and heroin), 
PAM score, SF-36v2 PCS score, history of juvenile 
detention, prior adult incarceration, duration of index 
prison sentence, parole on release, risk of reoffending 
score, and receipt of the Passports intervention.23 To 
compare the risk of drug-related poisonings versus all 
other injury, we plotted the predicted hazard rates over 
time separately, stratified by mental health exposure 
group.
We replaced missing covariate data by multiple 
imputation (with 100 imputed datasets) using multivariate 
chained equations.36 We did sensitivity analyses to 
examine assumptions made in ascertaining our outcome 
and to investigate the possibility of informative censoring 
(see appendix pp 1–2 for further details).
We did all analyses using STATA version 14.2.

and ten who were not linked to administrative health 
records.
Most of the cohort was male and a quarter identified 
as Indigenous (table 1). Overall, 277 (21%) participants 
had dual diagnosis, 99 (8%) had mental illness only, 
314 (24%) had substance use disorder only, and 
617 (47%) had no recent history of a diagnosed mental 
disorder. Mental disorder diagnoses are displayed by 
ICD-10-AM chapter and mental health exposure status 
in the appendix (p 7). 591 (45%) participants had a 
substance use disorder and the most common diagnosis 
was polydrug use and other psychoactive substance 
disorders (363 [28%] participants). The most common 
mental illness diagnoses were neurotic, stress-related, 
and somatoform disorders (175 [13%] participants); 
mood 
disorders 
(163 
[12%] 
participants); 
and 
schizophrenia, schizotypal, and delusional disorders 
(135 [10%] participants; appendix p 7).
A principal diagnosis of injury was the leading cause 
of emergency department presentation (680 [31%] 
of 
2173 
presentations) 
and 
hospital 
admission 
(199 [24%] of 819 admissions), and accounted for the 
largest and second largest proportion of emergency 
department hours (3524 [35%] of 10 052 h) and hospital 
bed-days (678 [24%] of 2784 days), respectively. Mental 
disorders accounted for the largest proportion of hospital 
bed-days (732 [26%] of 2784 days).
There were 2056 person-years of follow-up, with a 
median 
of 
495 
days 
(IQR 
163–958). 
In 
total, 
407 (31%) individuals had 898 injuries resulting in 
hospital contact during follow-up, giving a crude 
incidence rate of 436 injuries (95% CI 408–466) per 
1000 person-years. The crude injury rates per 1000 person-
years for each exposure group were 996 injuries 
(893–1112) for the dual diagnosis group, 538 (441–657) for 
the mental illness only group, 413 (354–482) for the 
substance use disorder only group, and 275 (247–307) for 
participants with no mental disorder. Overall, the rate of 
hospital admission for injury (ie, excluding emergency 
department 
presentations) 
was 
97 
injuries 
per 
1000 person-years (95% CI 85–111). The rate of hospital 
admission for the dual diagnosis group was 263 injuries 
per 1000 person-years (214–323).
Overall, 111 (12%) injury events were drug related. The 
crude incidence of drug-related injury (ie, drug-related 
poisonings) was 54 injuries (95% CI 45–65) per 
1000 person-years compared with 383 injuries (356–411) 
per 1000 person-years from all other causes. Piecewise 
incidence rates within 2 years of release from prison 
show that in the first 30 days after release, the rate of 
drug-related injury for the dual diagnosis group 
(1615 injuries per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 1160–2250) 
was significantly higher than for all other exposure 
groups (p=0·0010 for mental illness only and p<0·0001 
for substance use disorder only and for no mental 
disorder; figure 1). After 30 days of release from prison 
(ie, from 31 days to 2 years after release) in the dual 
diagnosis group, the rate of drug-related injury decreased 
to 199 (154–257) per 1000 person-years compared with 
752 (660–858) per 1000 person-years for injury from all 
other causes (figure 2). Drug-related injury accounted for 
11% (91 of 840 events) of all injury events after 30 days of 
release from prison. Over the entire follow-up period, the 
rate of drug-related injury was 738 events (452–1205) per 
1000 person-years compared with 877 injuries (559–1374) 
from all other causes per 1000 person-years for the dual 
diagnosis group.
Compared with all other mental health exposure groups, 
the dual diagnosis group had increased rates of drug-
related injury during follow-up that peaked immediately 
upon release and declined quickly thereafter to plateau at 
around 45 days post release (figure 2). By contrast, the rate 
of injury from all other causes was consistently elevated 
within 2 years of release (figure 2).
After adjusting for covariate effects, the dual diagnosis 
and mental illness only groups were at increased risk of 
injury after release from prison compared with the no 
mental disorder group (table 2). The median survival

time to first injury event was 246 days (IQR 73–522) for 
the dual diagnosis group, 453 days (226–840) for the 
mental illness only group, 575 days (261–1213) for 
the substance use disorder only group, and 929 days 
(368–not reached) for the no mental disorder group. 
Being younger at release, released from an index sentence 
of less than 90 days, and poorer physical health (as 
measured by PCS) prior to release from custody predicted 
increased rates of injury in the community (table 2).
The dual diagnosis group had greater rates of injury 
diagnoses that were system wide or affecting multiple 
body regions, poisoning or toxic effects injury, and injury 
from self-harm than did all other mental health exposure 
groups (figure 3). The incidence of head or neck injuries, 
traumatic brain injury, amputations or open wounds, and 
injuries from exposure to mechanical force was particularly 
pronounced in the dual diagnosis group. Incidence rates 
by body region, nature of injury, and external cause of 
injury are presented in the appendix (p 8).
The dual diagnosis group, which made up 21% of the 
cohort, accounted for 226 (33%) of the 680 emergency 
department presentations for injury during follow-up; 
45 (56%) of the 80 injuries that were classified as system 
wide or multiple body regions; 37 (69%) of the 54 self-
harm injury events; 73 (50%) of the 147 emergency 
department presentations categorised as resuscitation

(to be seen immediately) or emergent (to be seen within 
10 min) at triage; and 123 (43%) of the 288 emergency 
department presentations that required a stay longer 
than 4 h in duration (appendix p 9).
Hospital admissions for injury accounted for 756 bed-
days during the study period, 52 (7%) of which were 
psychiatric 
bed-days. 
The 
dual 
diagnosis 
group 
accounted for 372 (49%) of all hospital bed-days and 
49 (94%) of all psychiatric bed-days during follow-up 
(appendix p 10).
Sensitivity analyses supported our primary analysis 
(appendix p 11); however, when restricted to hospital 
admissions only, a larger effect size was observed for the 
dual diagnosis group (adjusted hazard rate ratio without 
imputed values 5·31, 95% CI 3·39–8·32; p<0·0001) than 
when analysed for emergency department presentations 
and hospital admissions combined. Conversely, when 
restricted to emergency department presentations only, 
a smaller effect size was observed for the dual diagnosis 
group (2·55; 1·74–3·72; appendix p 11).
Discussion
In a representative cohort of adults released from prison 
in Queensland, Australia, we found that those with dual 
diagnosis of mental illness and substance use disorder 
had approximately three times the rate of injury resulting 
in hospital contact after release from prison compared 
with adults without a mental disorder, whereas adults 
with mental illness and no substance use disorder had 
almost twice the rate of injury. Adults released from 
prison are at high risk of injury: injuries accounted for 
one in three emergency department presentations and

one in four hospitalisations during follow-up. Our 
findings show that risk is concentrated in people with a 
mental illness, particularly those with a co-occurring 
substance use disorder. Targeted preventive efforts are 
urgently needed to reduce the burden of injury in people 
with a dual diagnosis after release from prison. However, 
a recent review37 of effective interventions in socially 
excluded groups highlighted the substantial gaps in our 
understanding of prevention strategies for people 
released from prison. Mental health service providers 
should be aware that young adults, those with poor 
physical health, and those serving sentences shorter than 
90 days in duration are particularly vulnerable to injury 
after release from prison.
Compared with all other mental health exposure 
groups, the rate of injury within 30 days of release from 
prison was higher for the dual diagnosis group, and 
peaked within the first week after release from prison. 
However, the rate of injury from all other causes exceeded 
that from drug-related injury within 30 days of release for 
all exposure groups. Considerable research and policy 
attention has been devoted to the risk of acute, drug-
related death after release from prison.38 We observed an 
acutely elevated risk of drug-related injury in people with 
a recent history of dual diagnosis, who accounted for 
eight of ten drug-related injuries within the first 30 days 
of release from prison. Our findings provide new evidence 
to help to target the prevention of drug-related harm after 
release from prison and suggest that, rather than focusing 
on all drug users, scarce resources should be allocated to 
those with a recent history of dual diagnosis.
After adjusting for model covariates, the association 
between substance use disorder only and injury was 
attenuated. Injury from all other causes substantially 
exceeded drug-related injury after 30 days from prison 
release for all exposure groups, accounting for 
approximately nine of ten injuries resulting in hospital 
contact thereafter. Previous research and policy responses 
have predominantly focused on overdose in people 
released from prison.38 Although drug-related harm is a 
substantial concern for people recently released from 
prison, our findings indicate that even among people 
with substance use disorder, the burden of preventable 
injury is primarily due to causes other than drug overdose.
The rate of hospital admission for injury after release 
from prison in our cohort was approximately four times 
greater overall and 12 times greater in the dual diagnosis 
group than in the general population, which is estimated

at 22 injuries per 1000 person-years, excluding com-
plications of medical care and surgical care.5 This 
observation is consistent with prior research that has 
found that injury was the leading cause of hospitalisation 
and accounted for the second-most bed-days within 
12 months of release from prison.19 Importantly, in our 
study we were able to identify the characteristics most 
strongly associated with injury in this population.
We found that one in five adults released from prison 
had a recent history of dual diagnosis, which is ten times 
higher than the estimated 12-month prevalence in the 
general Australian population.39 The dual diagnosis group 
accounted for half of the most severe resuscitation or 
emergent emergency department presentations and half 
of all hospital bed-days. These findings suggest that 
individuals with dual diagnosis might be at particular risk 
of more severe injuries. Prior research in the general 
population has reported a high prevalence of traumatic 
brain injury, particularly severe and repeat traumatic brain 
injury, among people with dual diagnosis.17 Among people 
with a history of incarceration, some forms of injury such 
as traumatic brain injury might increase the risk of future 
offending, providing a further reason to prioritise and 
invest in prevention for this marginalised group.
Recent NICE guidelines20 have highlighted that in-
carceration provides a key public health opportunity to 
target clinical care and develop tailored care pathways for 
people with co-occurring disorders. People with dual 
diagnosis being released from prison have increased 
health and social service needs compared with those with 
one mental disorder alone,40 and there is good evidence 
that coordinated and continuous care improves health 
outcomes for this population.41 However, in most 
settings, care for people released from prison is neither 
coordinated nor continuous,42 and services for dual 
diagnosis are typically limited both in prison and in the 
community.43 Although appropriate care has resource 
implications, the financial cost of injury-related hospital 
contacts alone is substantial.19 A randomised trial and 
economic evaluation of enhanced care for people with 
dual diagnosis transitioning from prison to the 
community is both feasible44 and strongly needed.
Strategies to reduce injury in the community 
predominantly rely on a universal prevention approach. 
However, for groups at high risk of injury, such as adults 
with dual diagnosis released from prison, universal 
injury prevention strategies are probably not sufficient 
and such efforts should be complemented by intensive, 
tailored responses.45 Although the association between 
Indigeneity and recurrent injury after release from 
prison was attenuated to the null after covariate 
adjustment, given that Indigenous Australians are over-
represented in prison by an age-adjusted factor of 13,46 
incarceration remains an important driver of health 
disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
Australians. The development of tailored injury 
prevention strategies for Indigenous adults released 
from prison could be an important component of efforts 
to reduce the health disparities experienced by 
Indigenous Australians.
Our study had several strengths. It was well powered to 
answer the research questions and the sample was 
broadly representative of all people released from prison 
in Queensland during the study period.23 Our study 
included a unique combination of rich baseline survey, 
prison medical records, and person-level linked ad-
ministrative emergency department, inpatient, and 
mortality data. To our knowledge, it is the first study to 
permit such comprehensive adjustment for potential 
confounders. Whereas prior studies have been limited by 
no access to private hospital records,47 our study linked 
emergency department and hospital records with state-
wide coverage using gold-standard probabilistic linkage 
methodology that has been validated previously to have 
false linkage rates of less than 0·1%.48
Our study also had several potential limitations. First, it 
was done in Australia, such that caution should be taken 
when generalising these findings to other countries, 
especially those with different health-care and correction 
al 
systems. 
Second, 
we 
ascertained 
mental 
illness 
and substance use disorder exposures from hospital, 
emergency department, and prison medical records. 
Psychiatric discharge diagnoses in hospital contacts have 
been found to have adequate reliability, particularly for 
broad categories of mental disorders.49 However, common 
mental disorders such as anxiety and conditions of lower 
severity are often not reliably diagnosed in acute care 
settings50 and it is thus likely that we under-ascertained 
these conditions in our mental health exposure, resulting 
in a conservative estimate of the association between 
mental disorder and injury. Third, our outcome was 
restricted to injury events resulting in hospital contact and 
as such we did not capture the entire burden of injury 
experienced by adults released from prison. Fourth, we 
ascertained injury events from state-based emergency 
department and hospital records, thus we did not capture 
events outside of the state of Queensland. However, for 
people residing in Queensland, interstate hospitalisations 
account for less than 1% of all hospital stays.51 Fifth, to 
maximise power, we included both the intervention and 
control arms of the Passports study in our analyses. This 
low-intensity intervention was designed to increase 
contact with primary care23 and had no effect on rates of 
emergency department or hospital contact. Furthermore, 
we 
observed 
no 
significant 
association 
between 
randomisation group and mental health exposure group 
(p>0·05). Our final model was nevertheless adjusted for 
randomisation group. Finally, we cannot eliminate the 
possibility of informative censoring due to re 
incarceration. 
However, sensitivity analyses made possible by our access 
to correctional records indicate that any such effect would 
be modest, and would attenuate the association between 
exposure and outcome, such that our estimates are likely 
conservative.

In conclusion, people with dual diagnosis are at 
increased risk of injury resulting in hospital contact after 
release from prison. Contact with the criminal justice 
system provides an opportunity to prevent subsequent 
injury morbidity in people with co-occurring disorders. 
Engagement with integrated psychiatric and addiction 
treatment, complemented by targeted injury prevention 
and delivered without interruption during the transition 
from prison into the community, might prevent the injury-
related disparities experienced by this vulnerable group.
