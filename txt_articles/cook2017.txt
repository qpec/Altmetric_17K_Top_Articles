Summary
Despite being infrequent, complications of airway management remain an important contributor to morbidity and
mortality during anaesthesia and care of the critically ill. Developments in the last three decades have made anaes-
thesia safer, and this has been mirrored in the equipment and techniques available for airway management. Modern
technology including novel oxygenation modalities, widespread availability of capnography, second-generation supra-
glottic airway devices and videolaryngoscopy provide the tools to make airway management safer still. However,
technology will only take safety so far, and non-technical aspects of airway management are critically important for
communication and decision making during airway crises, acknowledging a ‘cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate’ situ-
ation and transitioning to emergency front of neck airway. Randomised controlled trials provide little useful informa-
tion about safety in this setting, and data from registries and databases are likely to be of more value. This narrative
review focuses on recent evidence in this area.

Introduction
Although most airway management undertaken by
anaesthetists, intensivists and emergency physicians is
routine, uneventful and uncomplicated, when compli-
cations do arise they can be catastrophic, with devas-
tating outcomes for patients and clinicians alike [1, 2].
These events account for a significant proportion of
fatalities [3] and litigation related to anaesthesia [4].
Anaesthesia is increasingly safe, with current esti-
mates of anaesthesia-related mortality falling almost
ten-fold in the 20 years up to 1990 (3.6 per 10,000
pre-1970, 0.5 per 10,000 1970–1980s, 0.3 per 10,000
after 1990) [5]. The proportion of these deaths that
are due to airway complications is unknown, and is
likely to vary according to setting. In a 2005 study of
> 1 million ASA physical status 1–2 patients, the risk
of death or other serious complications from anaesthe-
sia was about 10 per million anaesthetics, with 40% of
events related to airway problems [6], whereas another
Japanese study reported cardiac arrest in 100 per mil-
lion anaesthetics, with airway complications and aspi-
ration accounting for 11% of events [7]. The 4th
National Audit Project of the Royal College of Anaes-
thetists and Difficult Airway Society (NAP4) reported
an incidence of airway-related death and brain damage
of 7 per million general anaesthetics in the UK [1, 2].
However, in less well-resourced settings, it is likely that
anaesthesia-related
mortality,
including
those

 airway events, is considerably higher. In Togo, the
mortality rate 24 h after surgery was 2.6%, with 93%
of deaths judged avoidable; 50% were attributed to
anaesthesia, including 30% attributed to ‘respiratory
management’ [8].
The nature and incidence of complications related
to airway management is well described and has been
subject to numerous reviews. It is not possible in a sin-
gle review to examine the full breadth of developments
in this topic. Previous reviews describe complications
and failure of airway management and the topics of
pulmonary aspiration, airway trauma and respiratory
complications of lung ventilation [9, 10]. Rather than
duplicate data available elsewhere, this narrative review
instead focuses on recent literature and, in particular,
how this provides information on the prevention of
such complications.
Research into complications – why
randomised controlled trials are of
limited value
A recent editorial commented on the “hegemony of the
randomised controlled trial (RCT) as the poster child of
evidence-based
medicine”,
and
the
importance
of
embracing other research modalities [11]. This is par-
ticularly the case when considering rare complications.
The typical airway RCT will be designed with a pri-
mary outcome that is a measure of efficacy (e.g. first
insertion
success
with
supraglottic
airway
devices
(SADs) or videolaryngoscopy) or, worse, a surrogate of
efficacy (e.g. airway leak pressure with SADs, laryngeal
view with videolaryngoscopes). Use of this primary
outcome measure will lead to a trial of usually 40–100
patients that is powered to detect a clinically relevant
difference in performance. These studies are invariably
performed in elective, healthy patients, without risk
factors for difficult airway management or hypox-
aemia,
and
often
performed
by
expert
clinicians.
Indeed, it has recently been argued that these are pre-
requisites for safe and appropriate airway research
[12]. As a result, there are a profusion of airway RCTs
that only provide information about aspects of device
efficacy. These studies generally show that most new
devices work reasonably well (> 90% efficacy) in these
low-risk settings. Meta-analyses of these same studies
inform us that these devices perform similarly (in
these low-risk settings) [13–15], even when that does
not ring true among clinicians using the devices on a
daily basis in normal clinical practice.
However, in modern airway management, SADs
are used for a variety of situations and patient groups
including: the obese; patients with high Mallampati
scores and other risk factors for difficult airway man-
agement; patients with varying degrees of gastro-
oesophageal
reflux;
prolonged
surgical
procedures;
abdominal surgery; surgery in lithotomy or prone posi-
tions; airway rescue; during cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion; and as a conduit for tracheal intubation [16].
Modern tracheal intubation equipment is used in
increasingly comorbid and obese patients. In each of
these settings the key decision in choosing a device is
safety. It is highly likely that devices determined to be
‘similarly efficacious’ in small RCTs differ in perfor-
mance when stressed by clinical setting or use in
higher risk populations/procedures [17]. Randomised
controlled trials performed in low-risk patients are
unable to answer questions about safety in complex
patient populations or high-risk settings, and these
data must be sought elsewhere.
The role of registries and databases
Databases collect large amounts of information about
routine cases, whereas registries more commonly col-
lect data about specialist procedures or subspecialty
practice. Databases not only have the potential to rep-
resent outcomes of everyday practice but also have
limitations. Common limitations include the popula-
tion captured (single hospital or atypical hospital pop-
ulation), and data collected (if data are collected for
billing or administrative purposes it may lead to omis-
sions or perverse associations). Several institutional
databases are relevant for exploring complications of
airway management:
•
The Danish Anaesthesia Database includes data
collected from almost half a million patients from
approximately 30 hospitals. The database has led to
the publication of useful papers examining the inci-
dence of and risk factors for patients for whom
there was difficulty in mask ventilation [18] and
tracheal intubation [18–23], and most recently on
emergency front of neck airway (eFONA) [24].

 •
A North American database from a small number
of academic hospitals, now forming the multi-cen-
tre peri-operative outcomes group, has also pro-
duced important analyses of routinely collected
data [25–30].
•
The ASA Closed Claims Project has also provided
considerable
insight
into
the
more
severe
airway misadventures over a period of two decades
[31, 32].
Relevant registries include:
•
NAP4 (described below) [1, 2].
•
Australia and New Zealand Emergency Department
Airway Registry (http://www.airwayregistry.org.au/).
This was established in 2011 and covering approxi-
mately 20 emergency departments (EDs) but with
limited output at present [33].
•
National Emergency Airway Registry (http://www.
near.edu/index.cfm) established in 2003. An emer-
gency medicine registry based in the USA collect-
ing data from > 20 hospitals in five countries.
The registry includes data from > 15,000 ED tra-
cheal intubations and aims to collect data on all
tracheal intubations, providing the opportunity to
report the incidence and prevalence of complica-
tions. The registry has tracked the impact of
practice changes, particularly the increasing use
of videolaryngoscopy, and has reported rates of
eFONA [34–36].
•
National Emergency Airway Registry for Children
(http://www.near.edu/near4kids/welcome.cfm).
A
paediatric intensive care unit (ICU)-based registry
in 22 hospitals which has published on major air-
way complications and the value of videolaryn-
goscopy in a cohort of > 1000 difficult paediatric
intubations [37, 38].
•
The Airway App (http://www.airwaycollaboration.
org/). This is a novel undertaking in which the
authors
have
created
an
open
platform
for
reporting
anonymised
data
on
awake
tracheal
intubations and eFONA. The database is mobile
phone-based and accepts data from any location
globally. In its first year, data were collected on
> 50 eFONA.
Fatal case reviews
Case reviews may include local critical event analyses,
coronial
cases,
medico-legal
cases,
published
case
reports (usually describing rarities) or analyses of reg-
istries and national audits. Apart from registries and
national audits, these involve single cases analysed by
individual clinicians and provide limited benefit in
terms of learning from thematic analysis and case sim-
ilarities. Through involvement in all such types of fatal
case
reviews,
common
themes
can
be
identified
(Fig. 1). It is likely that as much can be learnt from
the review of cases of difficulty where difficulty was
resolved with a favourable outcome, but that resource
is currently rarely examined.
Epidemiology of major and minor
airway events
NAP4 is considered by many to be the current bench-
mark in terms of quantitative data about the epidemi-
ology of important airway complications [1, 2]. It
comprised a one-year national registry of major airway
complications arising during anaesthesia and in the
ICU or ED that lead to death, brain damage, eFONA,
ICU admission or prolongation of ICU stay. This was
supported by a numerator survey and in-depth analy-
sis of each submitted case.
NAP4 reported 46 events per million general
anaesthetics
(95%CI
38–54)
or
1:22,000
(95%CI
1:26,000–18,000). Among approximately 3 million gen-
eral anaesthetics, there were 16 airway-related deaths
and three cases of persistent brain damage, equating to
a mortality rate of 5.6 per million general anaesthetics
(95%CI
2.8–8.3)
or
1:180,000
(95%CI
1:352,000–
120,000) (Table 1).
Several themes were identified in NAP4:
•
In three-quarters of cases, care quality was judged to
be ‘poor’ or ‘good and poor’. In a follow-up study,
human factors were identified in all cases, with an
average of four factors per case [39]. Poor judge-
ment, education and training were the commonest
contributory factors. Anaesthetists using ‘their usual
technique’ when this was not in the patient’s interest
was common. Best care may require involvement of
colleagues with other skillsets.

 •
Omission of airway assessment (risk of difficulty
and
of
aspiration)
and
failure
to
respond
to
findings at assessment contributed to poor out-
comes.
•
Poor planning and ‘failure to plan for failure’.
There were unstructured responses to difficulty and
unexpected failure. Airway strategies were advo-
cated, namely a logical sequence of plans, designed
to manage failure at each step and thereby achieve
oxygenation, ventilation and prevent aspiration.
•
Difficulty and failure was often managed with
repeated attempts, especially at tracheal intubation,
and was associated with deterioration to a ‘cannot
intubate,
cannot
oxygenate’
situation
(CICO).
Adopting a limited number of attempts as part of a
strategy was advocated.
•
Choice of technique was sometimes illogical; this
included using routine care in the face of known
difficulty and avoiding awake fibreoptic intubation
when
this
was
strongly
indicated.
Lack
of
experience, judgement, skills, confidence and equip-
ment all contributed.
•
First generation SADs were used in patients with
high aspiration risk or marked obesity, and were
followed by aspiration. Use of SADs by junior doc-
tors, and accepting a poorly functioning airway led
to
non-aspiration
events.
Supraglottic
airway
devices were also used to avoid anticipated difficult
tracheal intubation, but without a rescue plan. Sub-
sequent problems led to emergencies, including
deaths. Use of awake techniques or planned tra-
cheal intubation via the SAD early on would likely
have avoided such events.
•
Obese and morbidly obese patients were over-
represented in all areas of the project.
•
The need for multidisciplinary communication and
involvement of senior anaesthetic and surgical staff
in head and neck surgery cases was emphasised, as
these cases were prominent.
•
The obstructed airway accounted for many cases,
and these often progressed to CICO. Issues of poor
planning, communication, teamwork, equipment
and situation awareness were recorded. Tracheost-
omy with local anaesthesia appeared to be rarely
considered, and was encouraged. When difficulty
occurred in anaesthetised patients, and a surgical
airway performed by a surgeon was the backup
plan,
transition
was
often
delayed;
this
plan
requires a surgeon to be instantly available and
ready to act.

 •
During CICO, transition to eFONA was often
delayed and
often
failed. The
authors recom-
mended anaesthetists should be skilled and prac-
ticed in surgical (now ‘scalpel’) cricothyroidotomy.
•
Aspiration was the single commonest cause of
death in anaesthesia events, and approximately half
of the cases involved tracheal intubation. Poor
judgement was causative in many cases, including
poor assessment of patient and operation risk, and
choosing techniques that provided little or no pro-
tection against aspiration. The authors supported
rapid sequence induction (RSI) as a technique.
•
Unrecognised oesophageal intubation was (surpris-
ingly) still a cause of events and harm, accounting
for 6% of cases. Capnography should be used for
all tracheal intubations. Even during cardiac arrest
an attenuated capnography trace is present if the
tube is in the trachea. A flat capnograph trace indi-
cates failure of lung ventilation, and oesophageal
intubation or airway occlusion must be actively
excluded.
•
Emergence and recovery events accounted for 25%
of events and were associated with blood in the air-
way, airway obstruction and postobstructive pul-
monary oedema. Planning tracheal extubation of
the high-risk airway is as important as planning
tracheal intubation [40].
•
One in four events reported to NAP4 occurred in
the ICU or ED. In the ICU, displaced airways
(especially tracheostomy) were the greatest cause of
major morbidity and mortality. Obese patients were
again over-represented. Delayed recognition and
lack of a structured plan for such an event was
prominent. In the ED, most complications followed
RSI. In both areas, there were concerns about the
lack of equipment, skills, assistance and planning
for failure during RSI.
•
Compared with anaesthesia, events leading to death
or brain damage were 35-fold higher in ED cases
and 55-fold higher in ICU cases. Permanent harm
or death occurred in 14% of anaesthesia cases, 33%
of ED cases and 61% of ICU cases. The gaps in
care that were identified in ICU and ED cases were
more marked than in anaesthesia cases. These
included: lack of identification of at-risk patients;
poor planning; inadequate access to appropriately
skilled staff or equipment; delayed recognition of
events; and lack of structured and rehearsed strate-
gies for managing predictable airway complications.
The project findings suggest avoidable deaths due
to airway complications occur in the ICU and ED.
•
Failure to use capnography in patients whose lungs
were ventilated likely contributed to more than
70% of ICU-related deaths. This included contribu-
tions to failure to identify airway displacements or
to diagnose correct or failed rescue, including oeso-
phageal intubation. Failure of interpretation of
capnography also contributed. Increasing use of
capnography on ICUs was judged the single change
with the greatest potential to prevent deaths such
as those reported to NAP4.
The
project
made
many
recommendations
designed
to
improve
individual,
institutional
and
national resilience in airway management. Two years
after the publication of NAP4, a survey identified that
practice changes had been instituted in response to
NAP4 in 98% of UK hospitals [41]. The survey used a
safety gap analysis (assuming compliance with the rec-
ommendations to be a metric of safety) to measure
change. The highest safety gaps were in the ICU and
ED. The extent to which these safety gaps were closed
was 39% closure in anaesthesia, 48% in ED and 59%
in ICU.
Huitink et al. adopted a different approach, and
attempted to capture all potential and actual significant
airway events in a Dutch University hospital’s operat-
ing theatre over a 60-day period [42]. Cases were iden-
tified
by
daily
interviews
with
clinicians,
being
volunteered by clinicians and by triggered interviews
when the anaesthesia information system detected an
episode of oxygen desaturation (SpO2 < 93%). Epi-
sodes were divided into airway problems (unavoidable
events not leading to harm) and complications (avoid-
able events with the potential or causing actual harm).
Degree of harm was scaled, with ‘serious’ harm equiva-
lent to NAP4 entry criteria. During 2803 general
anaesthetics (81% elective, 19% emergency; 75% adult,
25% paediatric) there were 168 (6%) airway-related
complications. Events included: 24 (0.9%) serious com-
plications (events which would have triggered inclu-
sion
in
NAP4);

Forty-four
(1.5%) patients desaturated to SpO2 < 93% and eight
(0.3%) to < 50%. As a proportion of events, tracheal
intubation difficulty accounted for 23%, failed mask
ventilation 3%, aspiration 1.8% and laryngospasm 7%.
Events were most common in healthy, male patients,
in adults aged > 40 years or children aged < 10 years,
and in those with an elevated body mass index (BMI)
(48% of events in patients with BMI > 26 kg.m�2).
Timing of events was at induction of anaesthesia in
69%, during maintenance in 12%, and after surgery in
14%. This study provides an important counterpoint
to NAP4, emphasising how NAP4 only examined the
‘tip of the iceberg’; for every case captured by NAP4
there may be another 720 potential airway events
occurring that do not progress, for whatever reason.
This emphasises the importance of airway vigilance
and skills in anaesthetic practice.
De Jong et al. studied the epidemiology of airway
complications in obese ICU patients [43]. This study
compared two sequential cohorts of obese patients
whose
tracheas were
intubated during
anaesthesia
(n = 11,035, 19% obese) or in the ICU (n = 1400,
20%
obese).
Difficulty
during
tracheal
intubation
occurred twice as often in obese patients in ICU com-
pared with anaesthesia (16% vs. 8%). More impor-
tantly,
advanced
‘difficult
airway
management’
techniques were rarely used in the ICU compared with
during anaesthesia (10% vs. 36%), and life-threatening
complications were significantly more common in the
ICU than during anaesthesia (41.1% vs. 1.9%, relative
risk (RR) 95%CI 21.6 (15.4–30.3); p = 0.01). Among
the
obese
ICU
patients
with
difficult
tracheal
intubation, the rates of severe hypoxaemia (39%), sev-
ere cardiovascular collapse (22%), cardiac arrest (11%)
and death (4%) were of great concern. This important
study reinforces many of the findings of NAP4 regard-
ing the dangers of airway management in the ICU,
issues
around
preparedness
and
management
of
high-risk patients and the importance of obesity. The
study further identified risk factors for difficult tracheal
intubation
in
the
obese:
Mallampati
score
3–4;
obstructive sleep apnoea; and reduced cervical spine
mobility.
Of note, NAP4 and the studies by Huitink et al.
and de Jong et al. all emphasise the association of
elevated BMI and adverse airway events. Although
obesity may impact on the ease or success of facemask
ventilation,
SAD
insertion,
laryngoscopy (modestly
[44]) and eFONA, its most profound impact is on the
speed and extent of hypoxia during routine and diffi-
cult airway management, which dramatically reduces
the time during which success must be achieved [45].
Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea are at even
higher risk of increased airway difficulty and airway
obstruction leading to rapid hypoxia.
Martin reported a series of 3423 emergency out of
theatre tracheal intubations, all performed by experi-
enced operators [27]. Tracheal intubation difficulty
(Cormack–Lehane grade 3–4 or > 2 attempts) was
reported in 10%, and complications (4.2% overall)
included aspiration (2.8%) and oesophageal intubation
(1.3%). As in Mort’s previous work [46], multiple
attempts (> 2) were associated with an increase in
complications (OR 95%CI 6.7 (3.2–14.2)) as was tra-
cheal intubation in the ED (OR 95%CI 4.7 (1.1–20.4)).
The eFONA rate was 1:380. Videolaryngoscopy was
not in routine use, and approximately 30% did not
receive a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA).
In contrast, a Scottish national survey of tracheal
intubation performed by critical care doctors of similar
experience noted much lower rates of airway complica-
tions [47]. In this series of 794 patients (92% of whom
received NMBA), first-attempt tracheal intubation suc-
cess was 91%, despite 6% being Cormack–Lehane
grade 3–4; only 1% required more than two attempts.
Oesophageal intubation occurred in 2% and there was
one eFONA (1:794). Severe hypoxia and hypotension
both occurred in approximately 20%.

 Failure of routine airway techniques
Defining failure is part of the problem. Most anaes-
thetists experience airway management failure every
day or so; a poor seal is achieved with facemask venti-
lation; a SAD needs to be repositioned; or tracheal
intubation requires more than one attempt or needs
patent repositioning to be successful. In most studies
of airway device performance, these would be judged
‘failures’. In clinical practice, the anaesthetist moves to
another technique and is usually successful, and these
minor failures are of little or no consequence in the
majority of cases. However, failures such as these are
likely to be the first step in many more important and
potentially life-threatening complications.
Failure rates (i.e. inability to perform a technique
after multiple attempts) for routine anaesthetic airway
management techniques are as follows: facemask venti-
lation < 1:700; insertion and ventilation via SAD < 1:50;
tracheal
intubation
< 1:1500;
CICO < 1:5000;
and
requirement for eFONA ~ 1:50,000.
Multiple attempts without changing some aspect of
technique are illogical, and rarely effective. For example,
after failed tracheal intubation, subsequent attempts
have a success rate of approximately 20% [48]. Multiple
attempts also increase the risk of airway trauma and
development of airway obstruction, and compromise
the chances of success of other techniques [32]. Limiting
the number of attempts at a given technique is a funda-
mental aim during difficult airway events.
Several airway techniques have common risk fac-
tors for difficulty, including: obesity; reduced mouth
opening; Mallampati class 3–4; neck rigidity; and pre-
vious neck irradiation. When one airway technique
fails, the risk of failure of other techniques is higher
than
anticipated
(‘composite
airway
failure’
[10]).
Specific examples include: when tracheal intubation
fails, mask ventilation may fail in up to 10% of cases
[49]; when mask ventilation is difficult, the risk of
failed tracheal intubation increases more than 10-fold
[50]; and when SAD insertion fails, the risk of diffi-
culty in mask ventilation is increased threefold [29].
In order to minimise the risk of complications,
when one technique is predicted to be difficult it is
important to focus carefully on assessing the likely ease
of other techniques that may be used for rescue.
Avoiding complications
The commonest modes of airway management in
anaesthesia are SAD insertion and tracheal intubation
[50], accounting for 95% of airway management tech-
niques. These are also, with facemask ventilation, the
methods for maintaining the airway in emergencies
and crises. Therefore, the main priorities in avoiding
airway complications are:
•
avoiding hypoxia;
•
avoiding failure and complications of SAD inser-
tion and ventilation;
•
avoiding failure and complications of tracheal intu-
bation;
•
preventing CICO; and
•
managing CICO.
These are also the main principles embedded in
the Difficult Airway Society (DAS) 2015 guidelines on
difficult airway management [51].
Avoiding hypoxia
The most feared complication of airway management
is hypoxic death or brain injury. This is rare during
anaesthesia (1:180,000), but more common as a com-
plication of airway management and maintenance in
the ICU (approximately 50- to 60-fold higher) or in
the ED (approximately 30-fold higher) [1, 2]. NAP4
showed that approximately 40% of such events are ini-
tiated
by
delayed
or
difficult
tracheal
intubation.
Although many airway algorithms now adopt an
‘ABCD’
approach,
oxygenation
is
not
explicitly
addressed within this, and it might be useful if this
were changed to ‘OABCD’, in order to emphasise the
priority of maintaining high circulating levels of oxy-
gen in the blood, both before and during all attempts
at airway management.
Previously established pre-oxygenation practice has
included breathing 100% oxygen for 3–5 min via a
tight-fitting facemask. In the critically ill and in the
obese (both at higher risk of early and severe hypoxia)
[45], both sitting up/reverse Trendelenburg positioning
[52] and the use of continuous positive airways pres-
sure have been shown to be beneficial [53].

high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) delivered by cannulae

 at up to 60 l.min�1 to prolong the safe apnoeic time.
This technology has been shown to be highly effective
during elective apnoeic oxygenation (although less
effective in obese patients) [54]. However, its value is
less certain during RSI, where its use did not improve
oxygenation at the time of tracheal intubation [55]. In
the critically ill, trial designs that include small groups,
and control arms with non-standard methods of pre-
oxygenation [56], have led to literature without clear
evidence of benefit. A recent pilot study of the addi-
tion
of
HFNO
to
non-invasive
ventilation
(10/
5 cmH2O) in 48 critically ill hypoxic patients, reported
a reduction in the incidence of severe hypoxia from
21% to 0%, but no other outcome benefits [57].
There are alternative methods to deliver oxygen
during airway management (‘per-oxygenation’) and
these include: use of simple nasal cannulae at a flow of
≥ 15 l.min�1 once the patient is unconscious [58]; or
buccal oxygen [59]. Both prolong safe apnoea time. In
paediatric practice, pharyngeal oxygen delivered via the
laryngoscope [60] is a well-established technique, and
this might also have utility in the adult population [61].
The present level of evidence indicates that per-oxy-
genation should be used for all patients in whom diffi-
cult airway management is anticipated, and arguably in
all patients undergoing general anaesthesia. Following
loss of consciousness, it is logical to continue efforts at
per-oxygenation. This is particularly so for those with
high oxygen demand (the obese, critically ill, septic and
pregnant) and in those in whom airway management
may be predicted to be prolonged. The optimal method
of delivering per-oxygenation has not yet been estab-
lished and further research is needed to define the safest,
most effective and most economical solution.
As no method of pre- or per-oxygenation is effec-
tive if the airway becomes obstructed [62], all efforts
should be made to ensure a patent airway throughout
any period of pre- and per-oxygenation. Patients at
particularly high risk of obstruction are the obese,
those with pre-existing airway obstruction and those
with obstructive sleep apnoea (most of whom are likely
to be undiagnosed [63]).
Avoiding complications of SADs
Harm from use of SADs derives mostly from airway
failure (failed ventilation) or pulmonary aspiration.
Mechanical injury (direct trauma, nerve injury) is
considerably less common than when using a tra-
cheal tube. Basic principles should be followed and
SADs should only be used according to, and in set-
tings consistent with, manufacturers’ instructions for
use. Basic good practice includes avoiding SAD use
where there is a clinically significant risk of aspira-
tion (which is an undefined status, recognised by
most anaesthetists but open to considerable interpre-
tation). Training in device use should be meticulous,
and when used, devices should be tied in place; a
poorly seated or poorly performing device should
not be accepted, as these are prone to cause prob-
lems [1, 10].
However, in deciding the safe limits of SAD prac-
tice, many manufacturer’s instructions are not specific
and most rely hugely on clinical judgement. The
breadth of indications for which SADs are now used is
enormous, ranging from neonatal resuscitation, to
abdominal, cardiac, neurological or prone surgery and
even within ICU. Different clinicians will have a wide
range of personal views on what is a safe limit [64]
and individual clinician skill and experience may con-
tribute to the limits of safe practice. The absolute ‘lim-
its
of
safety’
are
still
undefined.
It
is,
however,
pertinent to remember that those limits will only be
established by passing beyond safe use and contribut-
ing to patient harm.
As described above, the current evidence base
regarding RCTs of SADs involves small studies per-
formed in low-risk patients. There have been three
meta-analyses of SADs: LMA�^ ProSeal
TM (PLMA;
Teleflex Medical, Wayne, PA, USA) vs. LMA Supreme
TM
(SLMA; Teleflex Medical) (seven studies, n = 666) [13];
PLMA vs. i-gel (14 studies, n = 1104) [14]; and SLMA
vs. i-gel� (Intersurgical, Wokingham, UK) (10 studies,
n = 860) [15]. There has also been a review comparing
the PLMA and LMA Classic
TM (Teleflex Medical) (nine
studies, n = 1436) [65]. This equates to a total of 4066
patients in 40 studies, an average of 101 patients per
study. With less than 50 patients on average exposed to
the novel SAD in each study, it is unlikely that any
study provides much evidence regarding safety; if no

 adverse events occur in a series of 50 cases the lower
limit of the 95%CI for such an event is 3/50 (6%) [66].
If RCT were set up to examine the risk of aspiration
when using the LMA Classic and another SAD in a low-
risk population (baseline risk of aspiration 1:10,000
[67]), using standard power calculations (power of 90%
and a type 2 error of 5%) the study would require
1.3 million patients in each group. Even then there
would be a 10% risk of a false negative and a 5% chance
of a false positive result.
Evidence of safety of SADs may more usefully be
derived from large cases series, ideally in representative
populations. For many devices in current use there are
no series of > 100 patients.
Theiler et al. reported on 2049 uses of the i-gel
[68]. First-attempt insertion success was 93% and
overall
success
96%.
Median
airway
seal
was
26 cmH2O. Premature removal occurred in 0.75% and
failure/complications in 5.4%. Failure was associated
with male sex, poor teeth, small jaw and older age.
Complications
included
laryngospasm
1.2%,
nerve
injury 0.1%, glottic haematoma 0.05%, vagal response
and cardiac arrest 0.05%.
Cook reported a series of 1000 PLMA uses by one
operator [69]. One-quarter of patients weighed > 90 kg
and 17% underwent abdominal surgery (12% laparo-
scopic, 5% open). The PLMA was inserted and used for
ventilation on first attempt in 85% and overall in 99.4%.
Of the six failures, two occurred during difficult airway
management. Median airway seal was 32 cmH2O. Pre-
mature removal occurred in 0.4% and failure/complica-
tions in 3.4% patients. Complications included minor
airway obstruction not requiring removal 2.7%, failure
(need for removal after an initially successful insertion)
0.4% and nerve injury 0.1% [70].
There are two large series of LMA Classic uses,
although both provide less detail than the above stud-
ies. Verghese and Brimacombe studied 11,910 cases of
LMA Classic use reporting a 0.19% failure rate and an
incidence of 0.15% for ‘critical airway incidents’ [71].
Bernardini and Natalini retrospectively compared aspi-
ration risk with the LMA Classic and tracheal tube
and reported three episodes in 38,200 LMA Classic
uses and an adjusted OR (95% CI) for aspiration with
the LMA Classic compared with the tracheal tube of
1.06 (0.20–5.62) [72]. Ramachandran reported on the
use of the LMA Unique (ULMA; Teleflex Medical)) in
15,795 cases [29]. Failure rate was 1.1%, predomi-
nantly due to leak or ventilation failure, and such fail-
ures were associated with hypoxia, hypercapnia and
airway obstruction. When the ULMA failed there was
a threefold increased risk of difficulty in mask ventila-
tion. Those in whom the device failed were at an
increased risk of unplanned hospital admission (14%)
of whom 5.6% required ICU admission. Risk factors
for failed use were male sex, poor dentition, increased
BMI and surgical table rotation. Further specialty-spe-
cific series exist for the PLMA [73] and SLMA [74],
both in the obstetric setting.
With the current literature and the pre-existing lim-
itations of RCTs in this setting, especially when com-
pared with the greatly expanded and extended routine
practice, clinicians must make choices about SADs
based on device design, device material and evidence
from benchtop, cadaver [75, 76] and clinical trials not
restricted to RCTs [16]. There is an increasing consen-
sus (particularly in mainland Europe, north America
and Australasia) that routine use of second-generation
SADs (i.e. those designed with the intent of reducing
the risk of aspiration [77]) is good practice [16]. Using
this strategy will provide the following performance
characteristics compared with the LMA Classic:
•
an airway that is secured at least as quickly;
•
a better airway seal;
•
usually a better oesophageal seal;
•
the capacity to check anatomical positioning;
•
functional separation of the gastro-intestinal and
respiratory tracts;
•
usually a bite block; and
•
a drain tube (for most devices) which enables gas-
tro-intestinal access to drain the stomach, facilitates
egress of regurgitated matter without airway soiling,
and provides an early indicator of regurgitation.
However, for the reasons described above, it is not
possible to prove that this strategy improves safety or
clinical outcomes.

 approximately 40% of major airway events [1, 2], and
occurs during the progression of the event in the
majority of such incidents. It is also associated with
airway trauma and aspiration [1, 2, 32] and precedes,
by definition, all cases of CICO. Difficult or failed tra-
cheal intubation may arise because of difficult laryn-
goscopy (difficulty seeing the laryngeal inlet), difficulty
passing the tracheal tube, or both.
An important strategy for avoiding difficult tra-
cheal intubation is avoiding intubation altogether when
it is not indicated. The increased performance of sec-
ond-generation SADs is one driver to reduced use of
tracheal intubation. However, such decisions require
significant clinical judgement, and it is likely that the
most difficult airway cases will remain predominantly
managed by tracheal intubation, whether asleep or
awake. Where difficulty is anticipated, tracheal intuba-
tion should generally be performed awake and the
options now include both fibreoptic and videolaryngo-
scopic techniques.
There is little robust evidence around the inci-
dence of difficult tracheal tube passage but it certainly
occurs. Strategies to reduce this include:
•
pre- and per-oxygenation to maximise available
time;
•
neuromuscular
blockade
(NMB)
(Difficulty
in
tracheal intubation without NMB OR 95%CI 13
[18–21], number needed to harm < 2) [23, 78];
•
optimal laryngoscopic technique to achieve a full
view of the laryngeal inlet;
•
using a curved tracheal tube so that its tip aligns
with the axis of the tip of the laryngoscope and the
axis of the trachea;
•
using a ‘beak bevelled tracheal tube’ (e.g. intubating
laryngeal mask (LMA Fastrach, Teleflex Medical)
or GlideRite tracheal tube (Verathon, Bothell, WA,
USA) to avoid hold-up at the cords [79];
•
using a bougie or stylet followed by tracheal tube
railroading where the view is imperfect [80];
•
rotating the tracheal tube during railroading to
avoid hold-up on periglottic structures, especially
where a bevelled tracheal tube is used [81];
When the above techniques are adopted, difficult
tracheal tube passage should become a very rare prob-
lem indeed. The problem much more commonly
associated with difficult tracheal intubation is, there-
fore, that of difficult laryngoscopy. Approximately 6%
of patients without features predictive of major diffi-
culty will be Cormack–Lehane grade 3–4 at laryn-
goscopy [82], and in a recent analysis of > 180,000
intubations from the Danish Airway Database, 93% of
difficult tracheal intubations were not anticipated [18].
Difficult laryngoscopy is associated with failure of
tracheal intubation, multiple attempts, airway trauma
and oedema in addition to major airway complications
such as hypoxia, aspiration, cardiac arrest, CICO and
death [1, 2, 10]. Although Cormack–Lehane grade-4
laryngeal views are most strongly associated with failed
tracheal intubation, they are rare and the majority of
failures (> 70%) arise from grade-3a or even grade-2b
laryngeal views [10] (i.e. ‘restricted views’ in Cook’s
classification [83]). Videolaryngoscopy has an impor-
tant role in both preventing and managing difficult
laryngoscopy.
In a prospective study, unanticipated difficulty in
tracheal intubation occurred at a rate of 0.1% [42]; res-
olution of these difficulties was achieved with a video-
laryngoscope in 52%, with fibreoptic intubation in 14%
and with a combination technique in 10%. A Cochrane
systematic review (64 RCTs, > 7000 patients, overall
moderate quality evidence) reported numerous benefits
of videolaryngoscopy vs. direct laryngoscopy for tra-
cheal intubation [84]. These included:
•
less failed tracheal intubation overall (OR (95%CI)
0.35 (0.19–0.65));
•
less failed tracheal intubation in patients with pre-
dicted difficult tracheal intubation (OR (95%CI)
0.25 (0.13–0.49));
•
more Cormack–Lehane grade-1 (OR (95%CI) 6.77
(4.1–10.98)) and fewer grade 3–4 views (OR (95%
CI) 18 (0.13–0.27));
•
greater ease of use (OR (95%CI) 7.13 (3.1–16.3));
•
less airway trauma (OR (95%CI) 0.74 (0.57–0.96));
and
•
less postoperative hoarseness (OR (95%CI) 0.57
(0.37–0.87)).
The outcomes ‘time taken for tracheal intubation’,
‘hypoxia’ and ‘mortality’ were not analysable due to
variations in definitions of these outcomes or lack of
data. There was a lack of evidence of impact of

 videolaryngoscopy
on
the
development
of
a
sore
throat, on the number of attempts taken, or in failed
tracheal intubation when difficulty was not predicted
(OR (95%CI) 0.61 (0.22–1.67)). In pre-planned sub-
group analyses, there were inadequate data to report
on the impact of videolaryngoscopy in specific clinical
locations (e.g. ICU or ED) or in obese patients. How-
ever, the data showed that benefits of videolaryn-
goscopy were only statistically significant when used
by an operator who was experienced (defined as > 20
prior uses) (OR (95%CI) 0.32 (0.13–0.75)).
The review also provides some evidence of differ-
ential performance between different videolaryngo-
scopes. The C-MAC� (Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen,
Germany) standard blade reduced failed tracheal intu-
bation (OR (95%CI) (0.15–0.68)), but reductions in
failure with other devices did not reach statistical sig-
nificance. Conversely, a recent RCT suggested a mod-
est increase in first-time success during use of the
Glidescope (Verathon) compared with the C-MAC D-
blade (Karl Storz GmbH), although this difference was
not sustained after multiple attempts or in the hands
of senior staff [85].
Further studies are required in order to determine
the relative value of different videolaryngoscopes and
in different clinical settings and locations. In particular,
the
literature
regarding
videolaryngoscope
use
in
obstetrics and ICU is particularly unclear. Several
recent registry studies have reported increased utility
of videolaryngoscopy in the ED setting. Sakles et al.
compared the relative success of direct and videolaryn-
goscopy on first-attempt tracheal intubation success in
2423 patients (Fig. 2) [86]. Videolaryngoscopy outper-
formed direct laryngoscopy in all settings with an
overall OR of success of 2–3 across all patients. The
same group also reported that in 460 failed tracheal
intubations in the ED, videolaryngoscopy was success-
ful in rescuing tracheal intubation in 82% of attempts,
compared with 61.7% of direct laryngoscopy attempts
(OR (95%CI) 3.5 (1.9–6.7)) [87]. Direct laryngoscopy
had a first-attempt success rate of 58%, with 78% of
these tracheal intubation failures rescued on first
attempt with videolaryngoscopy [88].
The National Emergency Airway Registry (NEAR)
has also measured the impact of videolaryngoscopy on
emergency tracheal intubations [34–36]. In a series of
8000 cases between 1997 and 2002, a change in tra-
cheal intubation technique was required in 5%, failure
occurred in 1%, complications occurred in 9% and
eFONA in 1:120, increasing to 1:59 for trauma cases
[35]. Using the C-MAC videolaryngoscope, the group
reported a higher rate of good views (Cormack–Lehane
grade 1–2) (93% vs. 80%; p < 0.0001). In those with a
poor direct view, videolaryngoscopy improved the view
in 78%, and in those with a good view on direct laryn-
goscopy, videolaryngoscopy worsened the view in 4%
[34]. More recently, NEAR reported on 17,583 ED tra-
cheal intubations (85% RSI) in USA, Canada and

 Australia between 2002 and 2012 [36]. During the
study, use of videolaryngoscopy increased from < 1%
to 27%; first-attempt success increased from 80% to
86% as videolaryngoscope use increased.
As a note of caution, there are two recent studies
suggesting harm associated with videolaryngoscopy.
Both involved critically ill patients, and there is a pau-
city of good quality evidence in this area. In a well-
designed study, Yeatts et al. examined the impact of
GlideScope use on outcome in a major trauma centre
[89]. Although GlideScope use had no effect on overall
survival
(p = 0.43),
in
a
retrospectively
identified
cohort of patients with severe brain injury, its use was
associated with increased mortality (p = 0.047). Use of
the GlideScope was associated with an increased time
for tracheal intubation and increased rates of hypoxia.
The MACMAN study, compared use of the McGrath
TM
MAC (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MA, USA) videolaryn-
goscope with direct laryngoscopy in critical care [90]
Use of the videolaryngoscope was associated with
improved glottic view, but not with increased speed or
success at tracheal intubation and after post hoc analy-
sis, videolaryngoscopy was associated with an increase
in severe life-threatening complications (9.5% vs. 2.8%,
p = 0.01). Although both studies may cause concern
among proponents of videolaryngoscopy, the study
findings have several potential explanations. In the
study by Yeatts et al. the finding was both a post hoc
analysis and statistically fragile. Notwithstanding that,
if use of videolaryngoscopy slows down tracheal intu-
bation this may have an important impact in the criti-
cally ill. This is perhaps an argument for favouring
(for routine use) a videolaryngoscope that can be used
for both direct and videolaryngoscopy rather than an
angulated videolaryngoscope which cannot be used
directly; an
angulated
videolaryngoscope
could
be
reserved for genuinely difficult laryngoscopy [91]. In
the MACMAN study, although the study was generally
well designed, the protocol had a few anomalies which
included the use of predominantly inexperienced tra-
cheal intubators, and uncertainty over the extent of
training with the videolaryngoscope. The McGrath
MAC videolaryngoscope has also been studied in rou-
tine anaesthesia, without showing any apparent benefit
over direct laryngoscopy [92]. It would be of value to
repeat this study using a device of proven benefit in
the anaesthetic setting and used by operators trained
and expert in the device.
Cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate
The term CICO is increasingly used for the previously
described ‘cannot intubate, cannot ventilate’ (CICV). It
better describes the problem and the priority and,
therefore, is advocated [93].
Cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate is more com-
mon
during
emergency
airway
management,
in
patients with head and neck cancers and in obesity,
trauma, obstetrics and locations outside the operating
theatre [1, 2]. In the elective setting, it occurs most
commonly after multiple attempts at tracheal intuba-
tion or other airway manoeuvres in patients in whom
ventilation was previously possible [1, 2, 32].
Avoiding CICO
Although
pre-operative
assessment
is
designed
to
detect an increased risk of airway difficulty, in a recent
analysis of > 180,000 intubations from the Danish Air-
way Database 94% of episodes of difficult mask venti-
lation
were
not
anticipated
[18].
Kheterpal
et al.
identified that difficult facemask ventilation occurred
in 5% of cases and difficult laryngoscopy in 5.8%
(n = 176,679) [30]. Difficult facemask ventilation was
almost twice as frequent when NMB was not adminis-
tered
and
administration
of
NMB
was
noted
to
improve mask ventilation in 3% of cases, but never to
worsen it. This is compelling evidence of the value of
muscle paralysis when trying to optimise mask ventila-
tion. Of note, if difficulty in mask ventilation and tra-
cheal intubation are independent of each other, one
would anticipate an incidence of 0.29% (1:330); how-
ever, the authors reported an incidence of difficulty in
mask ventilation with difficult laryngoscopy of 0.4%
(1:250), suggesting that the two factors interact. Of 678
patients who had both difficult mask ventilation and
difficult laryngoscopy, 461 were rescued with direct
laryngoscopy alone or with a bougie, 163 with a video-
laryngoscope, 35 with a fibreoptic technique and six
with an LMA Fastrach. In another large series of
53,000 anaesthetics, there were 77 (0.15%, 1 in 690)
cases of impossible mask ventilation [26]. Factors pre-
dictive of this were: neck radiation; male sex; sleep
apnoea; Mallampati score 3–4; and a beard). In 25% of
104

 the cases there was associated difficult laryngoscopy
(1:2800 overall).
Considerable discussion has taken place in the
anaesthetic literature recently on how best to manage
CICO, and which eFONA technique to use. Perhaps a
more useful strategy would be to increase efforts on
those techniques that are likely to prevent CICO.
These are central to the DAS 2015 guidance [51]
but can be expanded:
•
full
patient
assessment
and
development
of
a
patient-specific
airway
strategy
that
is
imple-
mentable by the present staff with the present
equipment,
communicated
to
all
present
and
understood by all [3, 4];
•
maintenance
of
oxygenation
throughout
airway
management
(pre-
and
per-oxygenation
via
a
patent airway);
•
avoidance of trauma in all techniques used;
•
optimal
laryngoscopy,
particularly
emphasising
early
videolaryngoscopy
and
avoiding
multiple
attempts;
•
airway rescue with a reliable (second generation)
SAD inserted by a trained individual with good
technique and avoiding multiple attempts;
•
neuromuscular blockade when airway management
becomes difficult, to facilitate mask ventilation [30]
and tracheal intubation [23, 78];
•
good communication within the team to ensure
transition to the next step of the strategy occurs in
a timely fashion and is communicated to all pre-
sent [51]; and
•
an overarching understanding of how human fac-
tors impact on performance and outcome; cognitive
aids and ‘action cards’ may have a role in avoiding
task fixation.
These guidelines advocate the use of videolaryn-
goscopy and second-generation SADs when difficulty
occurs. This begs the question, as they are considered
more effective and safer, as to why they are not used
as first choice for all patients. This will likely improve
speed, efficiency and safety of airway management. In
some hospitals, there is a move towards exactly this
practice.
Cognitive aids such as physical representations of
algorithms or aide memoires are likely to improve
compliance with guidelines [94, 95], but their utility is
impacted by design, and linear algorithms appear to be
better followed than others [96]. In this respect the
DAS 2015 guidelines are well constructed. Despite this,
it is uncertain whether algorithms help in a crisis and
augmentation by, for instance smart-phone apps [97]
or read-aloud action cards, may further enhance com-
pleteness of performance. In a simulation study, the
use of read-aloud cards significantly increased compli-
ance with the best practice steps of eFONA, but slo-
wed the procedure [98]. This area remains ripe for
research.
The Vortex approach© originates from Australia,
and is an intuitively appealing approach to any evolving
airway crisis. It divides airway management into a ‘green
zone’ of safety and a ‘vortex’ of progressive failure cul-
minating in eFONA for management of CICO [99]
(Fig. 3). Circling around the vortex are the three airway
options: facemask ventilation; SAD insertion; and laryn-
goscopy. The Vortex approach allows a maximum of
three attempts at each technique while the patient is in
the green zone, but rapid transition to eFONA if the
vortex is entered or after three attempts at each tech-
nique. If one ‘best attempt’ at each of the rescue tech-
niques is attempted while in the green zone, further
attempts are not mandated. The cognitive aid is
designed to ensure focus on the key parts of airway res-
cue, while avoiding delay, task fixation or cognitive over-
load. Despite its appeal, the Vortex approach has not
undergone formal evaluation to demonstrate whether
theoretical benefits are realised in clinical practice.
Managing CICO
Perhaps the most important aspect of managing CICO
is the decision to manage it. Death after CICO is nota-
bly more common due to failure to act than because
of procedural complications [1, 2, 32]. Although minor
complications of the technique are common, fatal
complications are very rare. The Australian and New
Zealand College of Anaesthetists has been progressive
about this issue, both in publishing a robust document
regarding the transition to CICO [100] and in mandat-
ing that management of CICO is practiced by anaes-
thetists on a biennial basis [101].
It is now standard practice to recommend both
full
neuromuscular
blockade
and
an
attempt
at

 insertion of a SAD [1, 2, 51]. The CICO situation
should be explicitly declared and there should be
immediate transition to eFONA [51]. In an efficient
setting, this will have been anticipated (e.g. through
use of the Vortex approach) and equipment will be
available, open and prepared. If SAD insertion has not
been attempted, this should be done immediately, as it
will rescue most cases of CICO [102].
Despite much debate and many strong opinions,
the optimal technique for eFONA is not known. In the
UK, the DAS guidelines are generally supportive of the
scalpel-bougie-tube technique [51], whereas in Aus-
tralasia the narrow-bore needle is generally favoured
[103].
NAP4 is often quoted as supporting the arguments
put down by those favouring the scalpel-cricothyroi-
dotomy technique [1, 2]. This is based on a misinter-
pretation of the NAP4 data and recommendations. In
NAP4, there were 80 eFONAs: 58 in the operating
room; 15 in the ED; and seven in ICU. Anaesthetists
were considerably more likely to choose a cannula-
based technique, and in the operating theatre 15 out of
25 attempts performed by anaesthetists failed. Overall
failure rate with cannulae (narrow and wide bored)
was 65% (22 out of 34). Technical, equipment and
operator failings all contributed. A total of 45 ‘surgical
or scalpel eFONAs’ were performed, and 44 (98%)
were successful in re-establishing the airway, although
not all patients survived. However, it is essential to
note that almost all surgical eFONAs were performed
by surgeons, and in this setting the anaesthetist often
maintained the airway and oxygenation from above.
The surgical procedure was often prolonged, in some
cases up to an hour in length [104]. In contrast, needle
techniques used by anaesthetists were generally in a
perimortem situation and other efforts at oxygenation
had to be abandoned. Overall, NAP4 does not inform
us whether the scalpel technique is more effective in
the hands of anaesthetists. Given the rarity of such
events it is unlikely that further useful information will
emerge without registry-based data collections. Such
databases are under development in the UK and Aus-
tralasia.
More important than NAP4 in this discussion is
the review by Duggan et al. published in 2016 [105].
This systematically examined efficacy and complica-
tions of ‘transtracheal jet ventilation’ (more correctly
termed ‘high pressure source ventilation’) [106]. The
analysis indicated reasonably high rates of success of
high pressure source ventilation in the elective setting,
but extremely high failure and complication rates
when the same technique was used in an CICO

 emergency (42% device failure, 32% barotrauma and
51% overall complication rate). The technique was
associated with failure and the development of subcu-
taneous emphysema that then hampered alternative
rescue techniques.
The Danish Airway Database recently reported
results of eFONAs from a cohort of approximately
450,000 general anaesthetics over a 7-year period [24];
eFONA occurred in 1 in 1700 anaesthetics. One-third
of cases were not predicted to be difficult tracheal
intubations. Approximately half the cases occurred
during ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery, with an
almost threefold higher incidence (1:625), and ENT
surgeons performed two-thirds of the procedures. Cur-
rently recommended techniques to manage CICO (i.e.
SAD insertion and paralysis) were used in a quarter
and half of patients, respectively. Anaesthetists per-
formed only a very small number of procedures, but
failed in half of those they attempted. Remarkably,
despite these shortcomings, the authors reported that
no patient died or developed brain damage as a result
of the airway event.
Where a narrow-bore cannula technique is used
for eFONA, active expiratory assist provides a new
method to provide normal ventilation. Using the Ber-
noulli principle, the Ventrain (Ventinova, Eindhoven,
the Netherlands) device facilitates active expiration via
a narrow cannula, thus enabling ventilation at conven-
tional rates and achieving normal minute volumes
[107]. The technology has been extensively used in
benchtop and animal models [107–109]. Recently there
have been reports of its use in the elective clinical set-
ting [110] and in paediatric airway rescue [111]. The
technology
provides
a
significant
potential
benefit
when CICO is managed with a narrow-bore cannula,
and more data are awaited.
Finally, the role of sugammadex in management of
a CICO situation has been debated. In a minority of
such situations, where neuromuscular blockade is con-
tributing to or causing the airway obstruction, sugam-
madex may be of value. However, sugammadex will
not reverse the hypnotic elements of anaesthesia, will
not reverse mechanical airway obstruction [112], may
cause laryngospasm [113, 114] and if CICO persists it
will be necessary to re-paralyse the patient with a non-
aminosteroid NMB before proceeding to eFONA [51].
Conclusions
Avoidance of major airway complications during rou-
tine and emergency care requires avoidance of hypox-
aemia, preservation of a clear airway and prevention of
pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.
Anaesthesia has become increasingly safe over the
last few decades, arguably as a result of improved
monitoring and equipment. In airway management,
there have been enormous technological advances and
the available equipment has the potential to make
every anaesthetic safe from an airway perspective.
With the advent of new modalities of oxygen delivery
that enable effective per-oxygenation, widespread avail-
ability of capnography [115], second-generation SADs
and videolaryngoscopy, airway management has the
potential to become safer still. Despite this, fatalities
from failed airway management continue to occur at
regular intervals in most countries.
Assessing safety and the impact of interventions is
unlikely to be revealed by RCTs that are primarily
focussed on efficacy. It is therefore likely that databases
and registries will provide data on safety in the future.
Technology can only provide safety benefits when
it is used, and used optimally. It is likely that future
improvements in safety will be brought about by
implementing the technology we already have and
using a human factors approach to ensure that it is
used to its best effect. This applies particularly to areas
such as communication and decision making during
airway crises, transitioning between techniques and
especially during management of CICO.
