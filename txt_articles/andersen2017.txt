ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND The diagnosis of heart failure may be challenging because symptoms are rather nonspecific. Elevated
left ventricular (LV) filling pressure may be used to confirm the diagnosis, but cardiac catheterization is often not
practical. Echocardiographic indexes are therefore used as markers of filling pressure.
OBJECTIVES This study investigated the feasibility and accuracy of comprehensive echocardiography in identifying
patients with elevated LV filling pressure.
METHODS We conducted a multicenter study of 450 patients with a wide spectrum of cardiac diseases referred for
cardiac catheterization. Left atrial volume index, in combination with flow velocities and tissue Doppler velocities, was
used to estimate LV filling pressure. Invasively measured pressure was used as the gold standard.
RESULTS Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 47%, with 209 patients having an LVEF <50%. Invasive
measurements showed elevated LV filling pressure in 58% of patients. Clinical assessment had an accuracy of 72% in
identifying patients with elevated filling pressure, whereas echocardiography had an accuracy of 87% (p < 0.001 vs.
clinical assessment). The combination of clinical and echocardiographic assessment was incremental, with a net reclas-
sification improvement of 1.5 versus clinical assessment (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS Echocardiographic assessment of LV filling pressure is feasible and accurate. When combined with
clinical data, it leads to a more accurate diagnosis, regardless of LVEF. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;69:1937–48)

H
eart failure (HF) is a major public health
problem that accounts for >1 million hospi-
talization discharges annually in the United
States (1) and nearly as many emergency room visits
(2). For patients presenting with dyspnea, the clinical
diagnosis can be challenging because HF symptoms
are relatively nonspecific and may be due to noncar-
diac disease. In that regard, cardiac imaging can be
helpful for reaching the correct diagnosis and subse-
quently guiding patient management. Echocardiogra-
phy is usually the first imaging test to obtain, as it
provides immediate information on left ventricular
(LV) size and function, including ejection fraction
(EF) and valvular function (3). However, the presence
of normal EF does not exclude a cardiac etiology for
dyspnea, as approximately 50% of patients with HF
have only mildly reduced EF or preserved EF (heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]) (4).
A diagnostic hallmark of HF is elevated LV filling
pressure,
a
compensatory
response
to
maintain
cardiac output that is observed regardless of LVEF.
Information about filling pressure is important not
only to diagnose HF, but also to better appreciate its
severity and, subsequently, the response to treat-
ment. Although cardiac catheterization remains the
gold standard, it is not practical to submit many pa-
tients presenting with dyspnea and suspicion of HF to
invasive studies. Accordingly, there is a continuing
search for noninvasive markers of elevated LV filling
pressure. In that regard, there are recent guide-
lines on how to apply echocardiography to estimate
LV
filling
pressures
that
are
based
on
expert
consensus but have not been validated against inva-
sively measured filling pressure (5). This multicenter
study sought to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy
of echocardiographic parameters recommended in
recent
clinical
practice
guidelines
in
identifying
the presence of elevated LV filling pressure and

 to determine the incremental value of combined
echocardiographic and clinical assessment for esti-
mating LV filling pressure.
METHODS
The
multicenter
study
sites
included
Methodist
DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center (Houston, Texas),
McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada),
Oslo University Hospital (Oslo, Norway), Yonsei Uni-
versity Severance Hospital (Seoul, South Korea), and
the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio). Echocardiog-
raphy was performed in 450 patients referred for
right- and/or left-sided heart catheterization (180
patients from previous studies [6–8] and 270 patients
included prospectively), either during or immediately
post-procedure
and
without
intervening
clinical
change or administration of medications. Catheteri-
zation was obtained to help guide diagnosis and pa-
tient management. All patients age >18 years were
included if willing and able to give informed consent.
Patients with prior cardiac transplantation or complex
congenital heart disease that limited the application
of
standard
2-dimensional
(2D)
echocardiography
Doppler methodology were excluded.
Clinical data were evaluated by an experienced
cardiologist. The evaluation, based on chart review,
determined whether patients were in HF or not given
their
symptoms
(exertional
dyspnea,
paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea); physical examination
findings
(S3,
pulmonary
rales,
increased
jugular
venous
pressure,
hepatomegaly,
hepatojugular
reflux, and pedal edema or anasarca); additional tests
(such as electrocardiography for rhythm analysis and
evidence of LV hypertrophy, acute coronary syn-
drome, or old myocardial infarction; or chest x-ray to
look for cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, pul-
monary edema, or pulmonary infiltrates); laboratory
tests for abnormally elevated biomarkers; plus past
and present medical history, blinded to invasive
measurements of LV filling pressure and echocardio-
graphic estimation of LV filling pressure. We investi-
gated
whether
the
available
clinical
information
could be used to determine whether LV filling pres-
sure was elevated. Echocardiographic data (2D and
Doppler) were applied to estimate LV filling pressure
as recommended in recent guidelines (5).
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC IMAGING AND ANALYSIS. Pa-
tients were imaged with ultrasound systems equip-
ped with multifrequency transducers. A complete
echocardiographic study was performed using stan-
dard views, with care taken to avoid foreshortening.
From
the
apical
window,
pulsed
wave
Doppler was used to record mitral inflow for 3
to 5 cardiac cycles at the level of the mitral
valve annulus and at the mitral tips. Pulmo-
nary venous flow was recorded from 1 of the
pulmonary veins, guided by color Doppler.
Tissue Doppler was applied to record mitral
annular velocities at the septal and lateral
sides of the annulus. The resulting annular
velocities
by
pulsed
wave
Doppler
were
recorded for 3 to 5 cardiac cycles at a sweep
speed of 100 mm/s. Tricuspid regurgitation
signals were recorded by continuous wave
Doppler
from
multiple
windows.
Saline
contrast was used in 11 patients, and echo-
cardiographic contrast was injected intrave-
nously in another 11 patients. It was feasible
to record inferior vena caval diameter (IVC)
and its collapse and hepatic venous flow from
the subcostal view in 314 patients. The Central
Illustration shows a schematic illustration of the
parameters used to estimate LV filling pressure (5).
Measurements were performed on computerized
off-line analysis stations without knowledge of inva-
sively derived hemodynamic data. LV volumes, EF,
and left atrial (LA) maximal volume were measured as
recently recommended (9). Right ventricular function
and valvular regurgitation were evaluated following
American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) recom-
mendations (10,11). Mitral inflow from tips level was
analyzed for peak early diastolic velocity (E) as well as
late diastolic velocity (A), E/A ratio, and deceleration
time. Pulmonary venous flow was analyzed for the
peak velocity of systolic, diastolic, and atrial reversal
signals. The ratio between pulmonary vein peak sys-
tolic and diastolic velocity and the difference in
duration between pulmonary vein atrial reversal ve-
locity and mitral A velocity were obtained (5). Mitral
annulus early diastolic velocity (e0) and late diastolic
velocity were measured at septal and lateral mitral
annulus and E/e0 ratios were computed. Interobserver
error (mean � SD) for mitral E velocity was 4 � 3%,
and for annulus e0 velocity was 5 � 2%. Intraobserver
error (mean � SD) for mitral E velocity was 3 � 2% and
for annulus e0 velocity was 3 � 2% (analysis repro-
ducibility). Measurements were averaged over 3 car-
diac cycles when patients had sinus rhythm, and over
5 cycles for patients in atrial fibrillation (AF).

CATHETERIZATION. Mean
right
atrial
pressure, pulmonary artery pressures (systolic, dia-
stolic, and mean), and pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure (PCWP) were measured with a pulmonary

 293 patients. The wedge position was verified by
fluoroscopy, changes in the waveform, and when
needed, changes in pulmonary vein oxygen satura-
tion (O2 saturation >95%). Invasive measurements
were acquired without knowledge of echo data. All of
them were derived at end expiration at an average of
5
cycles.
Fluid-filled
transducers
were
balanced
before the study with the 0 level at the midaxillary
line. Cardiac output (average of 3 cycles with <10%
variation in patients in sinus rhythm and 5 cardiac
cycles in patients with AF) was derived by thermo-
dilution only or both thermodilution and the Fick
method
using
nomograms
for
oxygen
uptake
in
conjunction with the Fick method. When a discrep-
ancy was present between both methods, cardiac
output by thermodilution was used. In 157 patients,
left heart catheterization only was performed and LV
diastolic pressures were obtained. In these 157 pa-
tients, LV pre-atrial contraction (pre-A) pressure was
measured and used as an estimate of PCWP, as PCWP
and LV pre-A are known to correlate well (12). All
patients in AF (except for 2 cases) underwent right
heart catheterization, and PCWP measurements were
used for analysis, whereas mid-LV diastolic pressure
was used in the 2 patients who underwent left heart
catheterization only. PCWP or LV pre-A pressure
>12 mm Hg was considered abnormally elevated (13).

CENTRAL ILLUSTRATION Continued
Elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressure may be used to confirm a diagnosis of heart failure. We sought to determine if echocardiographic indexes could be used
instead of cardiac catheterization for such a confirmation. (A) Of the echocardiographic parameters used, tricuspid regurgitation velocity is related to peak systolic
pulmonary artery pressure, the early diastolic mitral annulus velocity (e0) and the early (E) and atrial induced (A) mitral inflow velocities are related to LV diastolic
pressures, and left atrial volume index is related to left atrial pressure (LAP). (B) In the algorithm to estimate LV filling pressure, we incorporated recommendations
from recent guidelines (5), setting criteria of elevated LV filling pressures as either E/A ratio $2 in the presence of myocardial disease, or if E/A is <2, at least 2 of the
3 parameters shown must be above cutoff values (table in A). The algorithm was applied in patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or normal
LVEF but with myocardial disease. Echocardiography had an accuracy of 87% versus 72% for clinical assessment (p < 0.001), and the combination of clinical and
echocardiographic assessment demonstrated a net reclassification improvement of 1.5 versus clinical assessment (p < 0.001). E/A ¼ mitral early diastolic velocity/
atrial diastolic velocity ratio; E/e0 ¼ mitral early diastolic velocity/average early diastolic e0 velocity ratio.

Area

 of patients, mean PCWP was 17 � 9 mm Hg, and mean
LV pre-A pressure in the patients who underwent left
heart catheterization was 15 � 8 mm Hg. Elevated
LV filling pressure, as verified by invasive pressure
measurements, was present in 60% of patients with
EFs <50% and in 57% of patients with EFs $50%.
Moderately severe or severe mitral regurgitation (MR)
was present in 19 patients (elevated LV filling pressure
in 14 but normal in 5 patients), aortic stenosis of at
least moderate severity in 8 patients, pulmonary
parenchymal or vascular disease (type I pulmonary
arterial hypertension) in 71 patients, and end-stage
liver disease in 5 patients. The majority were in sinus
rhythm, with 41 patients having left bundle branch
block (LBBB) or paced rhythm and 18 patients with AF.
PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL DOPPLER AND 2D
PARAMETERS. When all patients were considered,
significant correlations were observed between 2D
and Doppler signals and LV filling pressure (Table 2).
Figures 1 and 2 show examples of echocardiography
Doppler and pressure recordings. For average E/e0
ratio, the correlation coefficient (r ¼ 0.65; p < 0.0001)
(Figure 3) was higher in patients who were not in
LBBB or on ventricular pacing and who did not have
significant MR (r ¼ 0.48; p < 0.01). The relation of LA
maximal volume index with LV filling pressure was
unchanged when patients in AF were excluded.

guidelines (5), the distribution of mitral E/A ratio, E/e0
ratio, LA maximal volume index, and peak tricuspid

2 of 3 variables meeting cutoff values was consistent with elevated LV filling pressure. Abbreviations as in Figure 1.

identified
patients
with
elevated LV filling pressure (Table 3) excluding pa-
tients with moderately severe or severe MR, paced
rhythm, and AF (which have different algorithms) and
the 31 patients where the method was inconclusive.
To investigate the accuracy of the algorithm in
patients with markedly reduced systolic function, an
additional analysis was carried out in the 159 patients
with EF #35%. In this subgroup, LV filling pressure
could not be assessed by echocardiography in 11
patients (indeterminate per the algorithm). In 129
patients with low EF and elevated LV filling pressure
by cardiac catheterization, the algorithm correctly
identified elevated filling pressure in 117 (91%); in 12,
however, filling pressure was incorrectly classified as
normal. Prediction was correct in 18 of the 19 (95%)
patients with normal LV filling pressure; the incorrect
prediction in 1 patient was elevated. When testing
average E/e0 ratio as a single predictor of LV filling
pressure, in these patients with low EF, prediction
was correct in 18 of 24 (75%) with normal filling
pressure during cardiac catheterization. Of the 135
patients with elevated LV filling pressure, prediction
by E/e0 was correct in 111 (82%).
LV filling pressure was significantly different be-
tween the 3 grades of diastolic dysfunction (analysis
of variance on ranks: p < 0.001). It increased from
10 mm Hg in grade I (interquartile range [IQR]: 7 to
12 mm Hg) to 18 mm Hg in grade II (IQR: 14 to 24 mm Hg)
and 24 mm Hg in grade III (IQR: 19 to 30 mm Hg) (grade I
vs. grade II: p < 0.001; grade I vs. grade III: p < 0.001;
grade II vs. grade III: p ¼ 0.006 by Dunn method).
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC
ASSESSMENT
OF
FILLING
PRESSURES VERSUS CLINICAL EVALUATION. Clin-
ical assessment of LV filling pressure was feasible in
448 of 450 (99.6%) patients; clinical status could not
be reliably assessed in 2 patients. The echocardio-
graphic approach was feasible in 419 (93.1%) and
inconclusive in 31 due to inability to acquire the
complete set of signals needed for estimating PCWP
as recommended in the guidelines. The comparison
of clinical diagnosis against echocardiographic diag-
nosis of elevated filling pressure (with invasive mea-
surement as the gold standard) is presented in Tables 4
and 5. The clinical diagnosis of HF and normal LVEF
had a sensitivity of 45%, a specificity of 76%, and an
accuracy of 64% in identifying patients with HFpEF
(13). N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-
proBNP) levels obtained on the same day as cardiac
catheterization were related to LV filling pressure in a
subset of 123 patients. In 41 patients with normal LVEF
and normal LV filling pressure, NT-proBNP levels
were <300 pg/ml, and levels were elevated and
consistent with increased filling pressure in 7 patients
who met the invasive diagnostic criteria of HFpEF.
However, the biomarker level was also elevated in 7
patients with normal LV filling pressure and normal
EF, and was <300 pg/ml in another 12 patients who had
an LV filling pressure >12 mm Hg. NT-proBNP levels
correctly identified 28 patients with depressed LVEF
and elevated LV filling pressure and 5 patients with
depressed LVEF and normal LV filling pressure. How-
ever, 17 patients with depressed EF and elevated LV
filling pressure and 2 with normal LV filling pressure
were not correctly identified by NT-proBNP levels.

patients with EF $50% (Table 5). The echocardio-
graphic diagnosis of elevated LV filling pressure
against the invasive gold standard was good for
patients with LBBB or a paced rhythm (AUC ¼ 0.84),
AF (AUC ¼ 0.83), or moderately-severe to severe
MR (AUC ¼ 0.96). For these disorders, the specific
approach
recommended
in
the
guidelines
was
applied (5).
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrated that echocardiogra-
phy can reliably identify patients with elevated LV
filling pressure with high feasibility and good accu-
racy. This was observed in a large sample from mul-
tiple institutions, including several patients who pose
challenges to the acquisition and interpretation of
echo data. Our study validated the recently published
ASE/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging
(EACVI) guidelines (5).
The study was unique given the large sample size,
the inclusion of patients with a wide spectrum of
underlying cardiac diseases, and a proportion of pa-
tients with normal LVEF, which is consistent with
what is seen in clinical practice (4). As recommended
in the guidelines, the study combines LA volume in-
dex as an indicator of long-term elevation of LV filling
pressure with Doppler velocities, which reflect filling
pressure at the time of echocardiographic examina-
tion (5). Given the performance of individual signals,
an approach combining different measurements, as
recommended in the 2016 guidelines, is essential to
correctly estimate LV filling pressure.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC ESTIMATION OF LV FILLING
PRESSURE BY EF. Patients with depressed LVEF and
normal wedge pressure usually have an impaired LV
relaxation pattern. However, when LV filling pressure
increases, predominant early diastolic filling occurs
(grade II and III diastolic dysfunction) with short
deceleration time and isovolumic relaxation time,
elevated E/e0 ratio, and increased pulmonary artery
pressures. These findings were verified in stable pa-
tients with HFrEF (14–24) as well as in patients with
acute decompensated heart failure (6,25). The current
study supports the important role of echocardiogra-
phy in estimating LV filling pressure in patients with
HFrEF, where concerns were raised about the accu-
racy of single indexes and reproducibility of tech-
nique (26,27). These concerns were expressed despite
numerous published studies from several laboratories
across the globe showing not only the diagnostic
aspect of the methodology but also its ability to pre-
dict outcome events. Notably, some of the studies
tried to apply the methodology to patients with
normal EF, but without cardiac disease where the

 are different from those in patients with abnormal
myocardial function (for example mitral annulus e0
velocity, which is directly related to filling pressure in
normal subjects). Other studies had technically chal-
lenging signals that were nevertheless still used to
derive conclusions or used the same general approach
to special patient groups where a specific approach is
recommended. Patients with EF <50% constituted
46% of our study population, and we noted similar
results. The comprehensive approach recommended
in the 2016 guidelines improved the diagnostic accu-
racy, which was 81% for clinical assessment alone to
91% by echocardiography (Table 5).
Estimation of LV filling pressure is more chal-
lenging in patients with normal EF. In our study, in-
dividual 2D and Doppler signals had significant but

Evaluation of diastolic function and LV filling pressure
(LVFP) in patients with dyspnea
To identify patients with cardiac disease in whom the algorithm (Central Illustration) can be applied, the evaluations start with clinical and
2-dimensional (2D) findings, followed by Doppler signals, and if needed, cardiac catheterization with or without noninvasive or invasive
diastolic stress testing. For diastolic function assessment in the absence of abnormal clinical and 2D findings, the evaluation begins with mitral
annular velocities, LA maximal volume index, average E/e0 ratio, and peak TR signal. When findings are indeterminate, other abnormalities
that point to cardiac disease could be considered, including LV global longitudinal strain (GLS), mitral annulus systolic plane excursion
(MAPSE), and LA strain. The latter approach needs validation. CHF ¼ congestive heart failure; echo ¼ echocardiography; LVFP ¼ left

 modest relations with LV filling pressure, similar to
previous studies (19–22). However, a comprehensive
approach, as recommended in the guidelines, resul-
ted in good accuracy that surpassed clinical assess-
ment alone (84% vs. 64%; p < 0.001).
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS. There are practical impli-
cations to our findings, as patients with previous HF
history, whether with normal or reduced EF, can have
other reasons for dyspnea, such as chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease. By accurately identifying the
correct cause of dyspnea in a patient, the appropriate
treatment can be implemented.
The starting point for evaluation is the history and
physical examination and, as needed, chest x-ray and
laboratory tests. In some patients, this can be enough
to reach the correct diagnosis. However, there are
challenges for clinical assessment, as noted in this
study for obese patients and for patients with pul-
monary disease, 2 groups with a high frequency of
concomitant cardiac pathology. Our findings high-
lighted the important role of echocardiography in
estimating LV filling pressure in patients who pose
problems to clinical evaluation.
Many clinicians utilize echocardiography mainly to
assess LV volumes and EF in trying to draw conclu-
sions about the etiology of dyspnea. LV filling param-
eters
are
often overlooked and some
physicians
assume that patients with depressed EF have elevated
LV filling pressure as the reason for shortness of
breath. We have shown that this is not the case for 40%
of patients with LV systolic dysfunction and depressed
EF, highlighting the need to acquire and analyze
Doppler signals in this patient population. Likewise,
although the majority of patients (57%) with normal EF
had elevated LV filling pressure, many patients did
not. Figure 4 presents our recommended approach to
the evaluation of patients suspected of having dys-
pnea due to elevated LV filling pressure.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. The current ASE/EACVI algo-
rithm recommends performing the diastolic stress test
in symptomatic patients who have normal filling
pressure at rest. Stress testing was not performed, and
it is possible that echocardiographic Doppler mea-
surements
during
exercise
could
have
revealed
elevated filling pressure in some of these patients
(28,29). For other subgroups with nonsinus rhythm
and for patients with hemodynamically significant
MR, the existing echocardiographic methodology is
promising but needs additional validation in larger
samples given the small number of patients in these
subgroups in our study. The algorithm is based on the
interpretation of 2D and Doppler signals in patients
with cardiovascular diseases and not in patients
without cardiac diseases, who are explicitly excluded
from the algorithm (5). The accuracy of echocardio-
graphic evaluation of LV filling pressure likely will be
lower when applied in populations with lower preva-
lence of cardiac disease. Echocardiography and car-
diac catheterization were not simultaneous in all
patients. However, there were no significant differ-
ences in heart rate and blood pressure between the 2
studies. The evaluation of the accuracy of clinical and
echocardiographic assessment was performed in the
same sample and needs validation in a separate group.
CONCLUSIONS
Echocardiographic assessment of LV filling is readily
available with high feasibility and good accuracy to
estimate LV filling pressure. Our study validated the
recently published ASE/EACVI guidelines. When used
in the proper context, it leads to a more accurate
diagnosis of elevated LV filling pressure, irrespective
of LVEF.
