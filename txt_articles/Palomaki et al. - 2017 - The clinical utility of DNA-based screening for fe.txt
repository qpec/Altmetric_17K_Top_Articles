 INTRODUCTION
Clinical validity and clinical utility were first applied to genetic 
testing by the US Department of Health and Human Services’ 
Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing.1 These 
concepts were further developed in projects such as the ACCE 
model2,3 (analytic validity, clinical validity, clinical utility, and 
ethical, legal, and social implications; Supplementary Figure 
S1 online, Supplementary Table S1 online) and the Evaluation 
of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention project 
sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.4 
Studies documenting the clinical validity of screening tests 
focus on quantifying the detection and false-positive rates 
under controlled conditions (e.g., karyotype-confirmed out-
comes, case/control, or high-risk setting). Often, these studies 
are performed in settings that do not represent clinical testing 
(e.g., bulk testing of stored samples, omission of patient report-
ing, little or no retesting of failures). However, studies of clinical 
utility are designed to be performed in a clinical care setting 
(e.g., patients informed of testing options, clinical test results 
returned and used in patient decision making). In addition 
to verifying test performance as determined by case/control 
or retrospective cohort studies, clinical utility studies can also 
examine process-related components of implementation such 
as provider education and experience, patient education and 
knowledge, screening uptake rates, and women’s decision mak-
ing. They can also explore other issues such as the economics 
of screening, long-term program evaluation, and availability of 
suitable facilities.3
Integrated screening is the most effective serum-based test 
for Down syndrome (90% detection rate, 3% false-positive 
rate), with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 6% in the general 
pregnancy population.5 In 1997, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was 
found in maternal circulation,6 and next-generation sequenc-
ing (NGS) enabled proof-of-concept studies identifying com-
mon fetal aneuploidies in 2008.7,8 In 2011, the first external 
clinical validation study reported 98.6% of 212 Down syn-
drome pregnancies were screen-positive, 0.2% of euploid preg-
nancies were false-positives, and 0.8% resulted in test failures 
(no calls) after duplicate sample testing.9 This test efficiency has 
been confirmed by others.10 The term “cfDNA screening” here 
refers to the NGS of placental and maternal DNA fragments 
in maternal plasma to identify common fetal aneuploidies (aka 
“noninvasive prenatal screening” (NIPS)11,12). After defining the 
term “cfDNA screening,” we used that term in all provider and

Objective: To assess the clinical utility of cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-
based screening for aneuploidies offered through primary obstetrical 
care providers to a general pregnancy population.
Methods: Patient educational materials were developed and validated 
and providers were trained. Serum was collected for reflexive testing 
of cfDNA failures. Providers and patients were surveyed concerning 
knowledge, decision making, and satisfaction. Pregnancy outcome 
was determined by active or passive ascertainment.
Results: Between September 2014 and July 2015, 72 provid-
ers screened 2,691 women. The five largest participating practices 
increased uptake by 8 to 40%. Among 2,681 reports, 16 women (0.6%) 
were screen-positive for trisomy 21, 18, or 13; all saw genetic profes-
sionals. Twelve were confirmed (positive predictive value (PPV), 
75%; 95% CI, 48–93%) and four were false-positives (0.15%). Of 150 
failures (5.6%), 79% had a negative serum or subsequent cfDNA test; 
no aneuploidies were identified. Of 100 women surveyed, 99 under-
stood that testing was optional, 96 had their questions answered, and 
95 received sufficient information. Pretest information was provided 
by the physician/certified nurse midwife (55) or office nurse/educa-
tor (40); none was provided by genetic professionals.
Conclusion: This first clinical utility study of cfDNA screening 
found higher uptake rates, patient understanding of basic concepts, 
and easy incorporation into routine obstetrical practices. There were 
no reported cases of aneuploidy among cfDNA test failures.

materials, individual patient reports, and surveys.
In 2012, the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists (ACOG)9 recommended offering cfDNA as 
secondary screening in high-risk pregnancies, with diagnostic 
testing offered to those with a screen-positive or failed result. 
ACOG13 and others14–18 recommended against cfDNA screen-
ing in the “lower-risk” population pending more information. 
At that time, the American College of Medical Genetics and 
Genomics did not directly address testing based on risk stratifi-
cation,11 although their most recent recommendations suggest 
offering testing regardless of initial risk.12 To avoid the impreci-
sion regarding testing “low-risk” or “high-risk” populations, we 
examined the utility of cfDNA testing with primary screening 
in the general pregnancy population (including the 15 to 20% 
of women age 35 and older). No study has yet demonstrated 
that a complex molecular test such as cfDNA screening can be 
offered successfully through primary obstetrical care offices.
Our process-oriented project aimed to document several 
clinical utility aspects of cfDNA screening for common aneu-
ploidies through the implementation of a statewide program 
called DNAFirst. DNAFirst would be offered through pri-
mary obstetrical care providers19 as a routine first-line prenatal 
screen for the general pregnancy population. The study’s fund-
ing source (Natera, San Carlos, CA) was not involved in study 
design, data collection or analysis, manuscript preparation, or 
final approval. There was no charge to patients or their insur-
ance for the DNAFirst test (the cfDNA portion of testing was 
provided by Natera), ensuring that women’s decisions about 
choice of screening test (integrated versus DNAFirst) would not 
be influenced by patient out-of-pocket expenses. The observed 
false-positive rates, PPV, and failure rates could be compared 
with those derived from previous clinical validity studies. 
Clinical utility issues addressed included comparing screening 
uptake rates before and after introducing DNAFirst, evaluat-
ing an innovative reflexive serum testing protocol for cfDNA 
failures, and exploring women’s decision-making. A survey 
was included to document experience, knowledge, and choices 
made by a subset of enrolled women. Participating providers 
were also surveyed to assess their ability to include DNAFirst 
into routine practice and to identify perceived advantages and 
impediments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Overview
The institutional review board at Women & Infants Hospital 
(WIH) approved the project (13-0013), which is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01966991). The DNAFirst screen 
begins with cfDNA testing performed by a commercial labora-
tory using a SNP genotyping method (Natera)20,21 with reflex-
ive serum/ultrasound screening in the event of cfDNA test 
failure. New DNAFirst patient materials specifically targeted 
for the general pregnancy population were developed, evalu-
ated,22 and validated using an approach reported previously.23 
Providers were offered a short in-service education program 
at each practice site. All pretest education was delivered to 
the pregnant women by primary obstetrical care providers 
in Rhode Island; logistics and materials resembled those of 
well-established serum screening protocols. Phlebotomists 
were trained and customized requisitions (Supplementary 
Figure S3 online) and reports (Supplementary Figure S4 
online) were tailored for our local practices (e.g., all reports 
included a reminder that serum screening for open neural 
tube defects should be considered). The DNAFirst program 
focused on trisomies 21, 18, and 13, as well as monosomy 
X, because these are identifiable by current integrated 
screening. Interpreting cfDNA results for common sex tri-
somies (e.g., 47, XXY)24–26 is not recommended by ACOG27 
but was included as a DNAFirst “opt-in” (including report-
ing the fetal sex). Women with screen-positive results were 
referred to the WIH Prenatal Diagnosis Center for genetic 
counseling and diagnostic testing. A subset of women with 
screen-negative or failed cfDNA tests was surveyed to learn 
about how DNAFirst test information was obtained, level 
of knowledge, satisfaction, and decision-making processes. 
Detailed methods are available in the supplement materials 
(Supplementary Methods online).
Data collection and statistical methods
Active enrollment was designed to run for at least 9 months 
allowing time for providers to reach a “steady state” of screen-
ing. This was also considered sufficient time to accumulate a 
minimum of 10 autosomal trisomies. Follow-up test results 
(e.g., reflexive serum testing, cfDNA testing after failure on 
a subsequent plasma sample, diagnostic testing results, preg-
nancy outcomes, newborn karyotypes) were sought for women 
with screen-positive results or initial cfDNA test failures. The 
95% confidence intervals (CI) of proportions were based on 
the binomial distribution (TrueEpistat, Round Rock, TX). 
Significance was two-tailed at the 0.05 level.
RESULTS
Enrolling providers
Primary obstetrical care practices were approached in June 
2014; five of the seven largest group practices in Rhode Island 
(>400 new patients per year) agreed to participate. Two 
declined, citing anticipated complexity and/or the 2012 ACOG 
recommendations against offering cfDNA screening to “low-
risk” women.13 Subsequently, smaller practices were informed 
and encouraged to participate. Between September 2014 and 
July 2015 (11 months), 2,691 women agreed to undergo screen-
ing through 72 providers. The five large practices included 78% 
of all providers and accounted for 82% of the women screened. 
DNAFirst became their primary screen within 2 to 11 weeks 
after introduction (i.e., when weekly DNAFirst tests exceeded 
those for serum screening in the previous 6 months). All five 
large practices eventually exceeded historical serum screening 
rates by 8 to 40% (average, 18%) (Figure 1). Insufficient num-
bers of screened women in the smaller/solo practices precluded 
performing a similar analysis.

 Characteristics of screened women
Figure 2 shows DNAFirst screening flow for the 2,691 women 
and focuses on trisomies 21, 18, and 13. Testing was not initiated 
for samples from 19 women, including 14 from a single lost ship-
ment. Thirteen women submitted a second sample (68%); the 
remaining six did not. After cfDNA testing, four samples were 
ineligible due to unreported exclusion criteria (three dizygotic 
twins and one donated egg). Of the three twin pregnancies, one 
was known and submission of the sample was in error, another 
was unrecognized at the time, and details were unavailable for 
the third case. Table 1 shows characteristics of the remaining 
2,681 women. Median gestational age was 12 weeks, with 1.6% 
collected after 20 weeks. Of the 43 initial samples collected 
after 20 weeks, 29 (67%) were collected by 24 weeks, which was 
beyond our recommended limit of 20 weeks for the study but 
still considered acceptable clinical practice. None of the samples 
collected at 25 weeks or later had an abnormal ultrasound find-
ing as an indication. Median maternal age was 31 years, with 
21% age 35 years or older—a rate similar to the 17% who under-
went serum screening in the previous 6 months. Self-reported 
race included 85% Caucasian, 6% African American, and 4% 
Asian American; 15% reported being of Hispanic ethnicity. 
Testing indication was primary screening for 88%, advanced 
maternal age for 10% (these were considered part of a general 
pregnancy population), and history of a spontaneous loss for 
1%. Requisitions for only eight women (0.3%) reported abnor-
mal ultrasound or abnormal serum screen results, support-
ing our contention that this cohort represents an unscreened 
general pregnancy population. We honored requests outside 
the recommended testing protocols if reliable testing was still

 possible (e.g., collection at 21 weeks was acceptable). This is in 
contrast to pregnancies with a donor egg, when testing using 
this methodology is not possible. No samples submitted for 
DNAFirst testing were excluded from this report.
Screen-positive results for trisomies 21, 18, and 13
The cfDNA screen-positive rate for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 was 
0.60% (Figure 2; 16/2,691; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.97%). Of these, 11 
were true positive and four were false positives; all were con-
firmed by invasive testing and diagnostic testing (e.g., karyo-
typing). The sixteenth result (screen-positive for trisomy 13) 
was clinically consistent with trisomy 13 (bilateral polydactyly, 
cystic hygroma, and spontaneous loss at 15 weeks with findings 
confirmed on abortus) but not karyotyped; it was also classi-
fied as a true positive. All 16 were referred to the WIH Prenatal 
Diagnosis Center and all were seen by genetic professionals. 
Nine true positives were prenatally confirmed and seven were 
terminated (78%). Based on maternal and gestational ages, 13.1 
autosomal trisomies were expected28 (9.4, 2.8, and 0.9 for tri-
somies 21, 18, and 13, respectively) and 12 were identified (7, 
3, and 2, respectively). The PPV was 75% (12/16; 95% CI, 48 to 
93%) and the false-positive rate was 0.15% (4/2,681; 95% CI, 
0.04 to 0.38%). Of the eight enrolled women with a previous 
abnormal ultrasound or serum screen result, one was screen-
positive for monosomy X and confirmed.
Screen-negative results
The screen-negative rate was 93.8% (Figure 2; 2,515/2,681); 
these were subject to passive ascertainment. Review of new-
born and infant karyotypes at WIH identified no additional 
aneuploidies and none were reported from participating pro-
viders. However, we were made aware of two monozygotic twin 
pregnancies with screen-negative cfDNA tests (cfDNA testing 
using the SNP-based methodology does not identify monozy-
gotic twins).
Failed cfDNA testing
The initial cfDNA test failure rate was 5.6% (150/2,681; 95% CI, 
4.8 to 6.5%) and all were subject to active outcome ascertain-
ment. For the 85 plasma samples subsequently submitted for 
cfDNA testing, 65 (76%) results were reported; all were screen-
negative (Figure 2). An additional 63 women relied on reflexive 
Figure 2 Flowchart showing DNAFirst testing for trisomies 21, 18, and 
13, along with additional testing for initial test failures and selected 
outcomes. Overall, 2,691 women agreed to testing and 2,685 samples 
had DNA sequencing. Of the 2,681 cfDNA tests reported, 0.6% (16) were 
screen-positive, 5.6% (150) failed to report at least one chromosome, and

 serum/ultrasound results; 54 (86%) were screen-negative and 9 
(14%) were screen-positive. Eight of these nine women deliv-
ered a normal infant (four also had a subsequent screen-
negative cfDNA test). The ninth woman was diagnosed with 
a mosaic condition after a positive cfDNA test from another 
sequencing laboratory; a normal female infant was delivered. 
Figure 2 lists outcomes for the remaining pregnancies with test 
failures. Our follow-up revealed that none of these 150 women 
chose invasive testing. To verify provider awareness that open 
neural tube defect screening is indicated despite normal cfDNA 
test results, records from 100 women consecutively screened 
in May 2015 (near the end of the study) were reviewed: 72% 
had serum alpha-fetoprotein screening for open neural tube 
defects, with no screen-positive results (≥2.0 MoM). It was not 
possible to determine whether the 28% of women who did not 
undergo open neural tube defect screening were not offered 
serum screening, declined serum screening, or underwent 
alternative testing such as a level II ultrasound.
Changes in testing over time
The numbers of providers and women screened increased 
over time, most rapidly in the first 6 months (Table 2). Three-
quarters of samples shipped the day of collection, with a median 
turnaround of 10 days (sample collection to report received 
by provider); 95% of results were returned within 15 days. In 
the first 2 months, a higher failure rate was noted in 35% of 
samples collected at 10 weeks. The 60 failures due to low fetal 
fraction occurred more frequently at 10 weeks versus 11–21 
weeks (risk ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3 to 4.5; P = 0.007). In month 
3, this prompted a recommendation that the optimal earliest 
time for collection would be 11 weeks although 10-week sam-
ples would be accepted. Subsequently, less than 8% of samples 
were collected at 10 weeks (Table 2). DNA failures were also 
confirmed29 to be strongly associated with maternal weight of 
80 kg or higher (risk ratio, 11.4; 95% CI, 6.3 to 21; P < 0.001; 
Supplementary Figure S5 online). In months 7 and 8, 22 addi-
tional failures at 3 weeks were attributed to a laboratory reagent 
problem that raised the rate to 7.1%.
Sex chromosome screening
All pregnancies were routinely screened for monosomy X and 
three (0.11%) were screen-positive (3/2,681; 95% CI, 0.03 to 
0.33%). Two were true positives; both ended in spontaneous 
losses. The third resulted in a late-first-trimester fetal loss with 
no diagnostic information (Supplementary Figure S6 online). 
Optional sex trisomy (and fetal sex) interpretations were chosen 
by 91.2% of the women (2,445/2,681). Two were screen-positive 
for a sex trisomy; both women received posttest genetic counsel-
ing and both declined prenatal diagnostic testing. Both infants 
were live-born; one was confirmed by postnatal karyotype. 
Thirteen additional sex chromosome failures occurred (0.5%). 
No discrepancies regarding the predicted fetal sex were reported.
Surveys of screened women
The test requisitions of two-thirds of women (Table 2) included 
permission to be contacted (an institutional review board 
requirement); a pool of 140 was selected. Seven phone num-
bers were incorrect or out of service, and contact was unsuc-
cessful for another 20. Of the remaining 113 women, 100 (88%) 
completed the 15-min survey after providing verbal consent. 
Interviews occurred 3 to 5 months after testing, but all women 
were still pregnant. This time frame was chosen to ensure that 
participants had completed all decision making about screen-
ing and follow-up prior to being contacted.
A complete list of responses to selected questions is shown in 
Table 3. Women reported receiving information from their phy-
sician or certified nurse midwife (55%) or an office nurse/educa-
tor (40%) in less than 5 min (36%) or in 5 to 9 min (39%). They 
reported sufficient time to talk with their provider (95%), hav-
ing their questions answered (96%), and feeling that the optional 
nature of screening was conveyed (99%). Although 85% under-
stood that the test identified Down syndrome, 15% thought it 
identified all genetic problems. Most (79%) understood that 
a negative result did not rule out Down syndrome but 13% 
thought it did. Overall, 69% knew that “the test could not tell for 
certain if the baby has Down syndrome”; however, 28% thought 
it could. Women were not nervous about testing (mean, 2.4; 1

 = not at all, 5 = very) and 93% rated their decision as “good” 
or “great” (mean, 4.2; 1 = terrible, 5 = great). Nearly all (97%) 
remembered reviewing DNAFirst results with office personnel, 
98% would recommend testing to friends, and 95% said they 
would undergo the test in their next pregnancy. They reported 
a willingness to pay $10 to $50 (38%) or $51 to $100 (33%) out 
of pocket. Eighty-seven women remembered making decisions 
regarding sex chromosome trisomy screening/fetal sex. The 78 
women who chose such screening wanted to know the baby’s sex 
(77%), wanted as much information as possible (67%), and liked 
not being required to pay (47%). Of nine women who did not 
choose sex chromosome trisomy testing, eight did not want to 
know the fetal sex. Knowing fetal sex was “very important” for 
46% and “not important for 34%”; 20% “did not want to know.” 
Surveying the obstetrical care providers
Surveys were completed by 33 of 72 providers (46%) and 
included 21 physicians and 8 certified nurse midwives. Among 
physicians, 90% reported personally discussing DNAFirst 
with women. An average of 6 min was spent informing and 
answering women’s questions (range, 2.5–15 min), which was 
consistent with women’s estimates. Providers felt their staff was 
adequately prepared (83%) and that 60 to 100% of women they 
talked to about DNAFirst accepted screening. Respondents 
thought women accepted screening to reveal fetal sex (90%), 
receive better/more accurate results (28%), receive earlier 
results (14%), simplify screening (10%), and undergo testing 
at no charge (7%). Providers were positive about the ease of 
offering DNAFirst, screening program support, and test perfor-
mance; however, they expressed concerns about the DNA fail-
ure rate, turnaround time, and costs of testing when the project 
ended.
DISCUSSION
This is the first report documenting multiple clinical utility 
aspects of a cfDNA-based prenatal screening test for common 
aneuploidies in a general US pregnancy population, offered 
through nonacademic, community-based obstetrical care prac-
tices. Patient educational materials were designed and validated 
specifically for use by the general population. The DNAFirst test

Utility of DNA screening in primary care  |  PALOMAKI et al
Original research article
 (cfDNA coupled with reflexive serum screening) was designed 
to address test failures in a population at general risk and to 
examine patient interest in sex chromosome screening as a 
test option. The associated programmatic activities were coor-
dinated through an experienced prenatal screening program 
whose structure was based on ACOG recommendations pro-
mulgated in 1982 that recommended a “coordinated system of 
care resulting in prompt, accurate diagnoses and appropriate 
follow-up services.”30
Concerns regarding the use of cfDNA in the general preg-
nancy population include the reliability of PPV estimates. 
Among our 16 trisomy 21, 18, or 13 screen-positives, the PPV 
was 75% (three true positives for each false positive or 3:1). 
These odds are 50 times higher than the 6% (1:17) achievable by 
integrated screening but 33 times lower than the >99% (>98:1) 
reported by several commercial laboratories. Individual risks or 
PPV of >99% are almost certainly overestimates because they 
do not account for rare clinical false-positive results that may 
even be analytically correct (e.g., confined placental mosaicism, 
vanished affected twin, maternal mosaicism, maternal can-
cer). Such high risks also tend to undermine the “screening” 
nature of this testing. Our PPV is consistent with the estimates 
reported from controlled clinical validity studies in the general 
pregnancy population.31,32
When screening in the general population, DNA test failures 
are a major concern. In the high-risk setting, women with test 
failures can be offered diagnostic testing due to their existing 
risk. It seems inappropriate to offer diagnostic testing to all 
women with a test failure in the general pregnancy population. 
For example, the risk of aneuploidy is likely to be quite low in 
a 21-year-old woman weighing 250 pounds whose test result 
is a failure due to low fetal fraction. We report a failure rate of 
5.6%, which is at the lower end of the published rates for this 
methodology6 but is still high. For DNAFirst, a new blood draw 
was required for a repeat cfDNA analysis in the event of a test 
failure and, although it delayed final reporting, no aneuploidies 
were identified. Our innovative reflexive serum testing proto-
col worked as intended to provide an acceptable alternative to 
repeat testing.
Recently, both the ACOG33 and ACMG12 recommended that 
genetic counseling and comprehensive ultrasound and diagnos-
tic testing be offered after an initial cfDNA test failure for both 
high-risk and general pregnancy populations.33 These recom-
mendations were based on only three published studies.21,32,34 
Of these, two did not perform routine repeat testing for all fail-
ures,21,32 but the other did.34 However, this latter study did not 
provide pregnancy outcomes among those failures. It is critical 
to distinguish between cfDNA test failure rates (and associated 
risk of aneuploidy) when only an initial test is performed ver-
sus those same rates after a duplicate or subsequent sample has 
been tested. Further analyses of the usefulness of repeat testing 
based on all relevant published studies are warranted.
Obstetrical care providers received in-person training and 
had program-specific, validated, and grade-appropriate patient 
educational materials available. Given this, our patient survey 
results indicated that most women understood the basic con-
cepts of cfDNA screening. The patient and provider survey 
results were unique in that they focused on pregnant women 
from the general population choosing cfDNA testing as a clini-
cal test after being informed by primary obstetrical care pro-
viders during routine clinical practice. None of the women 
received pretest education from genetic professionals because 
the lack of resources made this impractical. Such a practice 
would also deviate from established prenatal serum screening 
protocols. Although not perfect, levels of knowledge were at 
least as good as in studies of women undergoing genetic coun-
seling for cfDNA screening35–37 and in older studies of women’s 
knowledge regarding serum screening.38,39
A recent study performed in Indiana40 reported a similar 
patient survey. In that study, 98 women with a screen-negative 
cfDNA test completed a questionnaire about their understand-
ing. Nearly half (49%) said they “agreed” or “strongly agreed” 
with the (false) statement that “There is no longer a chance 
for my baby to have Down syndrome.” This contrasts with our 
survey, in which a similar question resulted in only 13% incor-
rect responses that there is “no chance” (another 3% reported 
“a 50/50 chance” and 5% said “didn’t know”). Our results are 
even more impressive given that most women in the Indiana 
population had high-risk pregnancies (67% were ≥35 years old, 
20% had an abnormal ultrasound result) and many had formal 
genetic counseling.
Our study has limitations. The size of the group tested (2,681 
women) allowed a confident estimate of only the false-positive 
rate (upper CI, 0.38%) and combined PPV (lower CI, 48% 
or >1:1). Also, the fact that there was no financial cost to the 
patient or her insurance may have resulted in higher uptake. 
However, our project was designed to simulate the low financial 
barriers to serum screening due to broad insurance coverage 
in Rhode Island. Such coverage may exist for cfDNA screen-
ing in the near future. We documented an average 18% higher 
uptake of DNAFirst than for serum screening among five large 
practices; a recent survey-based study found similar results.41 
Unfortunately, we could not determine the reason for this. 
It may be related to the higher detection and lower false-positive 
rates, the ability to learn the fetal sex earlier in pregnancy, the 
availability of testing at no charge, the simplicity of offering one 
test over a wide gestational age range, or a combination of these 
or other factors. Regardless, the findings have implications for 
future economic analyses. cfDNA testing may have a higher 
uptake than current serum screening when offered to a general 
pregnancy population, leading to a higher proportion of cases 
detected in the population. We did not have access to measures 
of socioeconomic status, but all the enrolled group practices 
accepted Medicaid recipients. In our project, 13.1 common tri-
somies were predicted, 12 were identified, and none were found 
among the 150 initial test failures. There were four spontane-
ous losses among these 150 women and the occurrence of an 
unidentified trisomic loss cannot be ruled out. Our popula-
tion was 85% Caucasian; this was the most common race indi-
cated by the 15% self-reporting Hispanic ethnicity. Thus, the

 transferability to racial/ethnic groups such as blacks and Asians 
may be more limited.
This study contributes new information about the clinical 
utility of cfDNA sequencing of maternal plasma to screen for 
aneuploidy in the general pregnancy population (as described 
by the ACCE model; Supplementary Figure S1 online, 
Supplementary Table S1 online). We successfully implemented 
such screening with validated pretest educational information 
delivered by primary obstetrical care providers. The women 
were adequately informed and providers were able to inte-
grate cfDNA screening into daily routines. The false- 
positive 
rate was confirmed to be very low and the PPV was confirmed 
to be much higher than that with current technologies. Test 
failures were adequately addressed through a combination of 
repeat cfDNA sampling and reflexive serum screening, and 
screening for neural tube defects continued successfully. We 
found higher failure rates at 10 weeks; this may suggest that an 
optimal window for general population screening is between 
11 and 18 weeks of gestation, with samples at 10 or 19 weeks 
or later still being acceptable. Given that such a program has 
now been shown to be feasible, laboratories must strive to offer 
affordable cfDNA sequencing that third-party payers could 
routinely cover in order to improve access to better aneuploidy 
screening for the more than 2 million pregnant women in the 
United States currently choosing prenatal screening for Down 
syndrome.42
