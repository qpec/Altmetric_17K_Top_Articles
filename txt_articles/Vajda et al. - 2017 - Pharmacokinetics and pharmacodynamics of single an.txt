Funding information: Both studies were
sponsored by Ligand Pharmaceuticals
Incorporated. No other funding was provided.
Aim: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and
multiple doses of a novel, oral glucagon receptor antagonist, LGD-6972, in healthy subjects
and subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
Methods: In the single ascending dose study, LGD-6972 (2-480 mg) was administered to
healthy subjects (n = 48) and T2DM subjects (n = 8). In the multiple ascending dose study,
healthy subjects (n = 12) received a dose of 15 mg LGD-6972 and T2DM subjects (n = 36)
received doses of 5, 10 or 15 mg of LGD-6972 daily for 14 days.
Results: LGD-6972 had linear plasma pharmacokinetics consistent with once-daily dosing that
was comparable in healthy and T2DM subjects. Dose-dependent decreases in fasting plasma
glucose were observed in all groups with a maximum of 3.15 mmol/L (56.8 mg/dL) on day
14 in T2DM subjects. LGD-6972 also reduced plasma glucose in the postprandial state. Dose-
dependent increases in fasting plasma glucagon were observed, but glucagon levels decreased
and insulin levels increased after an oral glucose load in T2DM subjects. LGD-6972 was well
tolerated at the doses tested without dose-related or clinically meaningful changes in clinical
laboratory parameters. No subject experienced hypoglycaemia.
Conclusion: Inhibition of glucagon action by LGD-6972 was associated with decreases in glucose
in both healthy and T2DM subjects, the magnitude of which was sufficient to predict improve-
ment in glycaemic control with longer treatment duration in T2DM patients. The safety and phar-
macological profile of LGD-6972 after 14 days of dosing supports continued clinical development.

INTRODUCTION
Elevated glucagon levels observed in T2DM exacerbate the hyper-
glycaemic state and its associated complications by increasing
hepatic glucose production.1 Animal models of T2DM have demon-
strated
the
utility
of
inhibiting
glucagon
action
for
treating
T2DM.2–4 Glucagon receptor (GCGR) neutralizing antibodies, anti-
sense oligonucleotides and/or peptide and small molecule glucagon
receptor antagonists (GRAs) have been shown to significantly
reduce blood glucose levels and improve glucose tolerance in vari-
ous rodent obesity and/or diabetes models.5–16 In T2DM patients,
small molecule GRAs suppress fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels.17–22 Thus, GCGR antagonism is a
validated mechanism to control hyperglycaemia and is a logical tar-
get
for
the
treatment
of
T2DM
and
other
hyperglycaemic
conditions.23–25

 LGD-6972 is a novel, orally bioavailable small molecule GRA
being developed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycae-
mic control in adults with T2DM. In vitro, LGD-6972 binds competi-
tively to GCGR with high affinity and selectivity, suppressing both
cAMP and glucose production.26 In vivo, LGD-6972 reduced acute
glucagon-stimulated hyperglycaemia as well as the hyperglycaemia
observed in diabetic mouse models.26 The pharmacological activity of
LGD-6972 appears to be mediated primarily by inhibiting GCGR sig-
naling. Herein, we describe the results of clinical studies evaluating
single and multiple doses of LGD-6972 in healthy subjects and sub-
jects with T2DM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1
| Study designs
Studies L6972-01 (NCT01919684) and L6972-02 (NCT02250222)
were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
guidelines.
An
Institutional
Review
Board
(IRB)
reviewed
and
approved the protocols prior to initiating the studies. All subjects pro-
vided written informed consent to participate. The primary objective
of both studies was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral
doses of LGD-6972. Secondary objectives were to characterize the
pharmacokinetic
(PK)
and
pharmacodynamic
(PD)
profile
of
LGD-6972.
Study L6972-01 was a single centre, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) study conducted in
two parts. Part 1 evaluated LGD-6972 in six groups of normal healthy
subjects (eight/group) and Part 2 evaluated LGD-6972 in a single
group of eight subjects with T2DM. In Part 1, healthy subjects were
randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either a single oral dose of
2, 10, 40, 120, 240 or 480 mg of LGD-6972 or placebo administered
in a fasted state. Dose escalation occurred after review of safety, tol-
erability and preliminary PK data from previous dose levels. Following
a 21-day washout period, subjects who received the 40 mg dose in a
fasted state received a second 40 mg dose after a high-fat breakfast
to explore food effects on pharmacokinetics of LGD-6972. In Part
2, T2DM subjects received a single dose of 40 mg LGD-6972 in a
fasted state after the equivalent dose had been administered to
healthy subjects and safety data had been reviewed. All subjects
were confined at the site for 48 hours after dosing, and returned to
the site 5, 7 and 14 days after dosing for follow-up visits.
Study L6972-02 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, sequential, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study conducted
at three sites in normoglycaemic healthy subjects (n = 12) and sub-
jects with T2DM who were inadequately controlled with stable met-
formin
monotherapy
(n = 36).
Twelve
healthy
subjects
were
randomized (3:1) to oral doses of 15 mg LGD-6972 or placebo once
daily in a fasted state for 14 days. T2DM subjects (12 subjects/dose
group) were randomized (3:1) to 5, 10 or 15 mg LGD 6972 or pla-
cebo once daily in the fasted state for 14 days. Subjects were con-
fined at the site for the entire 14-day treatment period, and returned
to the site for up to three weekly follow-up visits. Initiation of dosing
and dose escalation occurred in the T2DM subjects after review of
safety, tolerability and preliminary PK data from previous dose levels.
In both studies, subjects received once-daily placebo or LGD-
6972 as an aqueous solution formulated with CAPTISOL® (betadex
[β-cyclodextrin] sulfobutylether sodium). Subjects received standar-
dized meals during confinement in the clinical pharmacology unit.
Safety and tolerability were assessed during periodic physical exami-
nations and measurement of vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, 12-
lead
electrocardiograms
(ECGs)
and
continual
adverse
event
observation.
2.2
| Subjects
In the SAD study, subjects were healthy men and women, 21-
65 years of age. Eligibility criteria for T2DM subjects included
HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and ≤ 10%, FPG < 12.21 mmol/L, and BMI of 18.5-
38.0 kg/m2. T2DM subjects were required to discontinue any antidia-
betic medication 2 weeks prior to admission until after the last
follow-up visit. In the MAD study, subjects were men and women,
21-65 years of age. T2DM subjects were required to be on a stable
dose of metformin for ≥12 weeks without use of other antidiabetic
medications for >3 weeks, and have HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and ≤ 10.5%,
FPG ≥ 6.94 mmol/L and ≤ 14.43 mmol/dL, and BMI of 20 and
45 kg/m2.
Key exclusion criteria for both studies included: significant illness
such as cardiovascular, haematologic, respiratory, renal or gastrointes-
tinal disease; history of uncontrolled blood pressure; liver transami-
nase
levels
(AST,
alanine
aminotransferase
or
ALT,
aspartate
aminotransferase) > 10% × ULN;
creatine
kinase
(CK)
levels
> 2 × ULN; serum triglyceride level > 4.52 mmol/L. To be eligible,
women had to be either postmenopausal, surgically sterile or practi-
cing an effective method of birth control. Male subjects must either
have had a vasectomy or agreed that they and any female partners
would use two acceptable forms of contraception.

| Measurements
2.3.1
|
Pharmacokinetics
Plasma concentrations of LGD-6972 were measured by a validated
LC-MS/MS method. A time-exposure profile was measured through-
out a 24-hour period on day 1 in the SAD study, and on day 1 and
day 14 in the MAD study. Additional trough concentrations were
measured at several time points in the MAD study to investigate
steady state pharmacokinetics and clearance rates.
2.3.2
|
Pharmacodynamics
In the SAD study, FPG, fasting plasma glucagon, insulin and glucagon-
like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were evaluated in healthy and T2DM subjects.
In the MAD study, PD variables in both healthy and T2DM subjects
included FPG, fasting glucagon, total and active glucagon-like peptide-
1, and insulin measured at baseline and throughout the 14-day treat-
ment. Seven-point plasma glucose measurements were performed at
baseline (day −1) and at day 14 in all T2DM subjects. A 4-hour oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in T2DM subjects
receiving 10-mg LGD-6972 on day −1 and day 14 for measurement of
VAJDA ET AL.

 within-subject change from baseline for glucose, glucagon, insulin and
active and total GLP-1.
A direct Emax model was developed to evaluate the relationship
between plasma LGD-6972 concentration and change from baseline
fasting plasma glucose. The model estimated the maximum glucose
lowering effect (Emax) and plasma LGD-6972 concentration required
to attain 50% of the maximum glucose effect (EC50).
Descriptions of the analytical and statistical methods are availa-
ble online (Appendix S1, Supporting Information).

RESULTS
3.1
| Subjects and demographics
Baseline characteristics and demographics for the SAD and the
MAD studies are shown in Table S1, Supporting Information. In both
studies, all subjects completed the study as planned and no subjects
discontinued the study. No meaningful differences in demographic
or baseline characteristics were noted across treatment groups for
healthy subjects or T2DM subjects in either study. Mean baseline
HbA1c for subjects with T2DM was 7.3% in the SAD study and
8.3% in the MAD study, with no differences between treatment
groups.
3.2
| Pharmacokinetics
3.2.1
|
SAD study
LGD-6972 was well absorbed after single oral doses ranging from
2 to 480 mg. Figure 1A displays the mean LGD-6972 plasma con-
centrations by dose for healthy and T2DM subjects following fasted
administration. Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was achieved
for most doses approximately 6-8 hours postdose (Table S2, Sup-
porting Information). The maximum concentration (Cmax) and overall
exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] increased with increasing
doses of LGD-6972 in healthy subjects. The elimination half-life
across all dose groups ranged from 39.2 to 58.5 hours. LGD-6972
was not detected in urine (data not shown). The Cmax and AUCs
were 22.5% higher in fasted condition than in fed condition in
healthy
subjects
after
administration
of
40 mg
of
LGD-6972
(Table S2, Supporting Information). The Cmax was higher in T2DM
subjects than in healthy subjects, but overall exposure (AUC) was
similar between T2DM and healthy subjects (Table S2, Supporting
Information).
3.2.2
|
MAD study
The plasma PK of LGD-6972 following repeat dosing was comparable
and predictable from what was observed in the SAD study. The mean
plasma LGD-6972 concentrations over time on day 14, as well as
mean
plasma
LGD-6972
trough
concentrations,
are
shown
in
Figure 1B and C. Group mean plasma LGD-6972 PK parameters are
presented in Table S3, Supporting Information. The Cmax and expo-
sures increased dose-proportionately. The PK profiles were similar
between healthy and T2DM subjects following 14 days of treatment
with 15 mg LGD-6972 (Figure 1B). LGD-6972, as in the SAD study,
exhibited a long half-life in all dose groups (ranging from 43.7 to
58.6 hours), resulting in accumulation ratios of 2.5 to 3.1 in AUC0-
24hr following 14 days of treatment in T2DM subjects (Table S3, Sup-
porting Information). Steady state PK was achieved in all groups by
end of treatment (Figure 1C).

| Safety and tolerability
3.3.1
|
SAD study
LGD-6972 was well tolerated up to the highest dose tested
(480 mg). No healthy subjects or T2DM subjects had a serious
adverse event (SAE) or were discontinued from the study because of
an AE. There were no clinically significant or dose-dependent changes
in haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, ECG or vital signs, and
there were no reports of hypoglycaemia. Study drug-related treat-
ment emergent adverse events (TEAE) were observed in healthy sub-
jects but not in any T2DM subjects. Table 1 provides an overview of
AEs by treatment for healthy subjects. The most common TEAEs
were headache (n = 5) and gastrointestinal disorders (n = 4). Most

MAD study
LGD-6972 was well tolerated in healthy and T2DM subjects follow-
ing 14 days of dosing, with no clinically significant or dose-dependent
changes in haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, ECG or vital
signs. There were no serious adverse events and no study disconti-
nuations. Table 2 provides an overview of AEs for healthy and T2DM
subjects. Two healthy subjects who received 15 mg LGD-6972 expe-
rienced study drug-related TEAEs (headache). For T2DM subjects,
the most common study drug-related TEAEs were headache (n = 4)
and gastrointestinal disorders (n = 4). No other specific TEAEs were
experienced by more than one subject. Most TEAEs were of mild or
moderate severity (grade 1 or 2); however, one T2DM subject who
received 15 mg LGD-6972 had TEAEs with a maximum severity of
grade 3 (abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, headache and nau-
sea). One T2DM subject who received 5 mg LGD-6972 developed
increased ALT (>3X ULN), AST and gamma-glutamyl-transferase
(GGT), along with elevated per cent neutrophil and white blood cells
and haematuria during the follow-up period (14 days after dosing
ended). Bilirubin was not elevated (no Hy’s Law violation). All findings
were mild in severity and resolved by the end of study participation.
There were no cases of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. Small increases
in ALT from baseline were observed by day 14 in the T2DM subjects
given 5, 10 or 15 mg LGD-6972 (15.6, 2.6 and 5.6 U/L, respectively).
However, these increases were not dose dependent and group means

SAD study
LGD-6972 decreased FPG 24 hours after dosing in healthy subjects,
approximating dose-dependency (Figure 2A). In T2DM subjects
(Figure 2B), a single dose of 40 mg LGD-6972 decreased FPG by
2.78 mmol/L. The maximum effect was observed at 24 hours post-
dose but a reduction in FPG compared to baseline persisted through-
out the 144 hours of measurement.
LGD-6972 increased fasting plasma glucagon in healthy subjects
in a dose-dependent manner and in T2DM subjects given a 40 mg
dose (Figure S2, Supporting Information). LGD-6972 increased fasting
plasma total GLP-1 in healthy and T2DM subjects; however, active
GLP-1 and insulin were not consistently altered following LGD-6972
administration (data not shown).
3.4.2

MAD study
Treatment with 15 mg LGD-6972 once daily for 14 days resulted in
a slight decrease in FPG from baseline in healthy subjects and a larger
dose-dependent decrease in T2DM subjects (Figure 2C). PK/PD mod-
eling

an
Emax
model
predicted
a
maximal
decrease
of
−3.31 mmol/L (−59.6 mg/dL) with an EC50 of 42.2 ng/dL (Figure 2D).
LGD-6972 effects were reversible during the follow-up period.
Mean weighted average 7-point glucose was lower on day 14 rel-
ative to day −1 for T2DM subjects who received 5 mg (−2.28 mmol/
L), 10 mg (−2.36 mmol/L) or 15 mg LGD-6972 (−2.72 mmol/L). No
change from day −1 was observed for subjects who received placebo
(Figure S3, Supporting Information). Day 14 mean glucose was
decreased at all seven time points pre- and postmeal across all LGD-
6972 treatments versus the placebo group.
Effects on glycaemia were accompanied by increases from base-
line in fasting glucagon (305.0 ng/L) and total GLP-1 (2.1 pmol/L)
following 14 days of treatment in healthy subjects who received
15 mg LGD-6972 (Table S6, Supporting Information). Similarly, in
T2DM subjects who received 5, 10 or 15 mg LGD-6972, dose-
related increases from baseline in fasting glucagon (168.9, 211.9 or

dose-related effect of LGD-6972 on fasting insulin was observed
for healthy or T2DM subjects.
Figure 3 displays the mean change from preglucose load on day −1
and day 14 for glucose, glucagon and insulin in T2DM subjects in the
10-mg LGD-6972 group who received an OGTT. Placebo-treated
T2DM subjects had comparable OGTT results on day −1 and day 14.
As expected, there was a transient increase in plasma glucagon, fol-
lowed by a late rise in insulin levels.30 Although fasting glucagon
levels were elevated on day 14 in T2DM subjects receiving 10 mg
LGD-6972, the incremental change [area under the curve from time
0 to 4 hours (AUC0-4hr)] in glucagon following a glucose load gener-
ally decreased on day 14, relative to the AUC0-4hours on day −1
(Figure 3C and D). In contrast, while fasting insulin levels were
unchanged on day 14, there was an increase in insulin AUC0-4hours
when compared with day −1 (Figure 3E and F). Although baseline
fasting glucose was decreased on day 14, there was no difference in
the incremental change (AUC0-4hours) in glucose (Figure 3A and B) or
in total or active GLP-1 (Figure S4A–D, Supporting Information) dur-
ing the OGTT on day 14 relative to day −1.

DISCUSSION
GCGR antagonism provides a novel mechanism to modulate plasma
hyperglycaemia for the treatment of T2DM that would be comple-
mentary to some of the currently marketed agents.23 GCGR antago-
nism has also been proposed as an effective treatment for stress-
induced hyperglycaemia.25 GRAs reduce hepatic glucose production
by inhibiting the action of glucagon. Recently, it has been shown that
small molecule GRAs,17–22 a GCGR monoclonal antibody27 and an
antisense GCGR antagonist28 can reduce fasting plasma glucose
(FPG) and HbA1c in T2DM patients. Herein we report that treatment
with the novel, potent GRA, LGD-6972, results in dose-related
decreases from baseline in FPG in subjects with T2DM. Glucose
reduction was observed in fasting and postprandial states. The effects
on glycaemia in T2DM subjects were accompanied by dose-related
increases from baseline in fasting glucagon, total GLP-1 and active
GLP-1. As expected, in normal healthy subjects the reductions in FPG
were more modest but nearly equivalent proportional increases in
glucagon and total GLP-1 were observed. Decreases in FPG and
increases in glucagon and GLP-1 were expected because similar

However, unlike reports concerning other small molecule GRAs, the
robust glycaemic responses in T2DM subjects treated with LGD-
6972 were not associated with dose-related or clinically meaningful
changes in liver enzymes during the 14-day treatment or follow-up
period.
In the MAD study, the decreases in FPG in healthy subjects and
T2DM subjects treated with metformin monotherapy were apparent
24 hours after the first dose, reached maximal effect by day 5 and
were sustained at this level through the end of dosing. Decreases
from baseline in mean weighted average 7-point glucose were also
observed in T2DM subjects. Indeed, mean glucose values were
decreased at all seven time points on day 14 across all LGD-6972
treatments versus placebo, indicating that LGD-6972 was effective
throughout the day at modulating glucagon effects on fasting, pre-
meal and postprandial glucose. Based on the mean change from base-
line in the weighted average 7-point glucose on day 14, the projected
HbA1c reduction with longer-term chronic dosing is estimated to be
as much as 1.5%.29
For T2DM subjects, no dose-related effect on fasting insulin was
detected after 14 days of treatment compared to baseline. Consid-
ered in the context of decreased FPG, this result may reflect
decreased insulin resistance in the fasting state.
In contrast to the effects of fasting glycaemia, the pharmacody-
namic response observed during the OGTT was not anticipated. As
previously reported by Rizza,30 glucagon levels increased “paradoxi-
cally” in placebo-treated T2DM subjects on metformin only after an
oral glucose load. However, in this study, the mean change in gluca-
gon levels from baseline and the incremental change in glucagon
AUC0-4hours were decreased in LGD-6972-treated T2DM subjects
versus those receiving placebo. The observed decrease in glucagon
levels in response to an oral glucose load may reflect the accompa-
nied increased peak OGTT insulin levels and incremental change in
insulin AUC0-4hours observed on day 14 versus day −1. As might be
expected, the increased insulin levels in subjects who received
LGD-6972 were followed by a greater decrement in subsequent
glucose levels when compared to the response in subjects who
received placebo. This apparent improvement in insulin sensitivity
and insulin secretion in response to glucose load, accompanied by
increases that occurred in both active and total GLP-1, may be
responsible for the unexpected decrease in glucagon levels, as glu-
cagon secretion is normally highly sensitive to insulin and GLP-1
levels. If confirmed in subsequent studies of longer duration, the
clinical significance of these findings suggests that inhibition of the
glucagon response by LGD-6972 in the fasted state may abrogate
the increased overnight gluconeogenesis found in early T2DM,
while the potential concomitant improvements in fasting insulin
sensitivity and insulin secretion in response to an oral glucose load
may address the impaired insulin action in the fed state in clinically
manifest T2DM.
LGD-6972 was generally well tolerated in these studies, with a
safety profile supporting further development. There were no SAEs
and TEAEs were generally mild to moderate and related to head-
aches or gastrointestinal disorders. There was a trend towards
increased AEs with increased dose and larger, longer term studies
will be needed to better define the safety profile of LGD-6972. One
potential concern with this mechanism of action is hypoglycaemia.
In both studies, no healthy subjects or T2DM subjects experienced
a hypoglycaemic event during the treatment or follow-up periods.
Likewise, in studies with LY2409021 in T2DM, events of hypogly-
caemia were mild and infrequent, even at high drug exposure.19,20
This
suggests
that
glucagon-independent
counter-regulatory
mechanisms, such as a sympathomimetic response, may be ade-
quate in this setting to minimize hypoglycaemia in the presence of
competitive GCGR blockade.
Elevations in liver enzymes, predominantly ALT and to a lesser
extent AST, have been observed in the clinical trials of other GRAs,
including small molecules,17–22 a monoclonal antibody27 and an anti-
sense oligonucleotide,28 suggesting that it may be a pharmacologic
effect of GCGR blockade, although the mechanism is not known.
The increases in liver enzymes were reversible, and were not
reported to be associated with elevated bilirubin levels or other
signs or symptoms of liver injury in any of the studies. Elevations in
liver enzymes observed after treatment with LGD-6972 were not
dose dependent, and were not regarded as clinically significant
despite robust glycaemic efficacy. Larger clinical trials of longer
duration will be required to fully examine the effects of LGD-6972
on liver metabolism.
The GRAs MK-0893, MK 3577 and LY240902117,18,31,32 were
reported to have effects on plasma lipids, bodyweight and blood
pressure. These effects were not observed during treatment with
LGD-6972 or ISIS-GCGRRX28 at doses that displayed significant glu-
cose lowering. Whether this discrepancy is explained by differences
in study design, patient population or pharmacological effects among
the compounds is currently unknown.
In conclusion, the results of the Phase 1 studies reported here
demonstrate
that
oral
administration
of
LGD-6972
once
daily
achieved sustained, pharmacologically relevant plasma levels of drug
that were associated with glycaemic response in both normal and
T2DM subjects. The reduction in glucose with LGD-6972 was
observed in both fasting and postprandial states, and was accompa-
nied by an increase in insulin and a decrease in glucagon in response
to an oral glucose load. The extent and magnitude of the glycaemic
response in subjects with T2DM was sufficient to predict a significant
beneficial effect on glycaemic control when testing longer duration of
treatment in patients with T2DM. No meaningful safety or tolerability
issues were observed. These results support continuation of the
development of once-daily LGD-6972 into Phase 2 in patients
with T2DM.
