Purpose: To evaluate the sustained effect (up to 1 year) of a single, 12-minute vectored thermal 
pulsation (VTP) treatment in improving meibomian gland function and dry eye symptoms in 
patients with meibomian gland dysfunction and evaporative dry eye.
Methods: The prospective, multicenter, open-label clinical trial included 200 subjects (400 eyes) 
who were randomized to a single VTP treatment (treatment group) or twice-daily, 3-month, 
conventional warm compress and eyelid hygiene therapy (control group). Control group subjects 
received crossover VTP treatment at 3 months (crossover group). Effectiveness measures of 
meibomian gland secretion (MGS) and dry eye symptoms were evaluated at baseline and 1, 3, 
6, 9, and 12 months. Subjects with inadequate symptom relief could receive additional meibomian 
gland dysfunction therapy after 3 (treatment group) and 6 months (crossover group).
Results: At 3 months, the treatment group had greater mean improvement in MGS (P,0.0001) 
and dry eye symptoms (P=0.0068), compared to controls. At 12 months, 86% of the treatment 
group had received only one VTP treatment, and sustained a mean improvement in MGS from 
6.4±3.7 (baseline) to 17.3±9.1 (P,0.0001) and dry eye symptoms from 44.1±20.4 to 21.6±21.3 
(P,0.0001); 89% of the crossover group had received only one VTP treatment with sustained 
mean improvement in MGS from 6.3±3.6 to 18.4±11.1 (P,0.0001) and dry eye symptoms 
from 49.1±21.0 to 24.0±23.2 (P,0.0001). Greater mean improvement in MGS was associated 
with less severe baseline MGS (P=0.0017) and shorter duration of time between diagnosis and 
treatment (P=0.0378).
Conclusion: A single VTP treatment can deliver a sustained mean improvement in meibomian 
gland function and mean reduction in dry eye symptoms, over 12 months. A single VTP treat-
ment provides significantly greater mean improvement in meibomian gland function and dry eye 
symptoms as compared to a conventional, twice-daily, 3-month regimen. Early VTP intervention 
for meibomian gland dysfunction is associated with improved treatment outcomes.

Introduction
Dry eye is currently understood to be a multifactorial disease state that afflicts many 
millions of people worldwide.1 While our awareness of the disease has expanded 
exponentially since it was first documented in 1950,2 as a collective, we continue to 
struggle with formulating a comprehensive definition for this disease.3 Currently, the 
definition is constrained to that of measureable dry eye sequelae with no mention of 
an etiology. Despite the limitations of the current definition of dry eye, there is strong

consensus that meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is likely 
the leading cause of dry eye.4,5
This recent conclusion by the prestigious MGD Workshop 
report5 that MGD is likely the leading cause of all dry eye is 
supported by a large body of evidence-based medicine report-
ing that compromise to meibomian gland function negatively 
impacts all aspects of ocular surface health.4–10 This aware-
ness has thus impacted dry eye management in general, not 
only dry eye secondary to MGD. As an example, there are 
a growing number of reports indicating that patients with 
refractory dry eye, including those with Sjogren’s syndrome, 
show significant improvement when they receive effective 
therapy for MGD.3,11,12 These findings are in alignment with 
a statement that Wolff made in 1946 when he concluded that 
the meibomian glands “are essentially the glands proper to 
the cornea, which in the interests of vision have been moved 
out of the way.”13 The clinical science to substantiate that 
the health of the ocular surface is indeed dependent upon 
healthy meibomian gland function has taken several decades 
to emerge.9,14–16 The result is a growing awareness that ocular 
surface health cannot be sustained, optimized, or rehabilitated 
in the absence of a healthy meibomian gland function.3,17
It has been known for over 150 years that optimal treat-
ment of MGD requires that some method of evacuating 
meibomian gland contents be employed.18–21 In combination 
with the core-therapeutic step of gland evacuation, or as a 
limited home therapy, warm compresses for MGD continue 
to be recommended.22–25 (Warm compresses, or other methods 
of front surface lid heating, do not evacuate gland contents 
and are, therefore, best considered adjunctive therapy.17) 
Prior to the introduction of vectored thermal pulsation (VTP) 
therapy, the limitation of in-office gland evacuation was the 
pain caused by forceful gland evacuation.26
VTP therapy was specifically designed to bypass obstacles 
to heat transfer and simultaneously evacuate the gland con-
tents while heating the glands to therapeutic levels, $40°C.6,23 
Described fully elsewhere, the LipiFlow® System (TearScience 
Inc., Morrisville, NC, USA) applies heat (42.5°C) to both inner 
eyelid surfaces (insulating the eye from the heat) while pul-
sating pressure is simultaneously applied to the outer eyelids 
using an inflatable air bladder.20,27 This temperature allows for 
effective heating of the meibomian gland contents,6 while oper-
ating within a safe zone so as not to cause thermal injury.28,29 
As such, the LipiFlow® System is designed to evacuate the 
meibomian glands of the upper and lower eyelids simultane-
ously and with minimal discomfort, on average.20,27
The numerous peer-reviewed reports on the LipiFlow® 
System in both randomized controlled and uncontrolled 
clinical trials consistently show that the single 12-minute 
procedure is surprisingly effective and that the effect can be 
sustained.17,20,30–33 What has not been adequately investigated 
is the potential for a sustained effect (longer than 6 months) 
of a single VTP procedure. Uncontrolled reported case series 
evidence the effects can last longer than 12 months (up to 
3 years following a single treatment33) but these results remain 
open to question due to the absence of study controls.
In addition, prior published randomized clinical trials 
have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of VTP 
treatment for MGD as compared to conventional MGD 
therapy.17,20,30,31 However, only one study30 has compared a 
single VTP treatment to a robust, twice-daily, warm compress 
and lid massage home therapy, over 3 months, and the sample 
size in this study was small (n=31). Therefore, confirmation 
of these results with a larger study population is warranted.
Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to evaluate 
the long-term (up to 1 year) effectiveness in improving 
meibomian gland function and dry eye symptoms after a 
single, in-office, 12-minute VTP procedure for treatment 
of MGD by: 1) comparing its effectiveness to a twice-daily 
conventional MGD therapy over 3 months and 2) evaluating 
its effectiveness over 12 months.
Methods
This prospective, multicenter clinical trial was conducted in 
compliance with US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR): 
21 CFR Parts 50, 54, and 56. The study was performed under 
the approval of the Oak Lawn Institutional Review Board 
(Oak Lawn, IL) as a nonsignificant risk postmarket study, and 
all tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki for the protection of 
human subjects in medical research were strictly observed. 
This study was registered at the US National Institutes 
of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov) #NCT01521507. Between 
February 19, 2012 and October 15, 2012, a total of 200 adult 
subjects (400 eyes) with MGD and dry eye symptoms were 
randomized in the study at nine US sites. Subjects were not 
required to pay for their designated treatment.
Study design
The study was divided into two stages (Figure 1). Stage 
1: enrollment to 3 months was an open-label, randomized 
controlled study design to compare the effectiveness of a 
single VTP treatment with the LipiFlow® System (treatment 
group) to a standardized twice-daily warm compress and 
eyelid hygiene control therapy (control group). At the end 
of stage 1 (3 months) was a crossover VTP treatment of the 
control subjects (crossover group). Stage 2: between 3 and

VTp procedure for MGD and evaporative dry eye
12 months, an observational study was performed to evaluate 
the potential sustained effect of a single VTP treatment alone 
or in combination with other MGD and dry eye treatments 
deemed necessary during the study period. Subjects were 
entered into the following subgroups based on the subject’s 
self-assessment of the adequacy of symptom relief and the 
physician’s assessment that additional treatment was or was 
not necessary. 1) One VTP treatment: subjects received only 
one VTP treatment; 2) two VTP treatments: subjects received 
two VTP treatments; 3) combination treatment: subjects

received one or two VTP treatments followed by other pre-
scribed MGD or dry eye treatment. All subjects provided 
written informed consent prior to study participation.
inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows: Age at least 
18 years; willing to comply with the study procedures and 
follow-up; evidence of meibomian gland obstruction (based 
on a meibomian gland secretion (MGS) score of #12 for 
15 glands of the lower lid) in both eyes; reported dry eye 
symptoms within the past 3 months and a score $6 in both 
eyes using the Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness 
questionnaire;34 Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) 
questionnaire score $13 in both eyes;35 and mean lipid layer 
thickness of #80 nm in both eyes.34
exclusion criteria
Exclusion criteria were conditions that could potentially 
increase the risk of a procedure-related injury, limit effective-
ness of the study treatment, or interfere with the assessment 
of effectiveness. These included active ocular infection or 
inflammation (including allergic, vernal, or giant papillary 
conjunctivitis and severe eyelid inflammation); ocular sur-
face abnormality that may compromise corneal integrity; 
eyelid abnormalities that affect lid function; recent (within 
the past 3 months) ocular surgery, trauma, herpes, or recur-
rent inflammation; systemic disease condition that causes 
dry eye; punctal plugs or punctal occlusion within the past 
3 months; unwilling to abstain from the use of systemic 
medications known to cause dryness for the study duration; 
unwilling to abstain from the use of systemic or topical treat-
ments for MGD or dry eye for the study duration (except for 
over-the-counter [OTC] artificial tears, ocular lubricants, 
or dietary supplements); pregnant, nursing, or females of 
childbearing potential and not utilizing adequate birth control 
measures; and participation in another ophthalmic clinical 
trial involving a therapeutic drug or device within the past 
30 days. Prior to the baseline visit, subjects were required 
to discontinue use of systemic antihistamines or isotretin-
oin for at least 1 month, cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 
(Restasis®; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) for at least 2 
months, all other prescription medications used for dry eye 
or MGD (eg, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs) for at least 2 weeks, and all other 
MGD treatments (eg, at-home warm compress therapy, 
eyelid hygiene, eyelid massage, and manual lid expression) 
for at least 2 weeks.
Randomization and subject disposition
A total of 101 subjects (202 eyes) were randomized to the 
treatment group (VTP treatment) and 99 subjects (198 eyes) 
were randomized to the control group (warm compress and 
eyelid hygiene). Subjects in the treatment group received 
a single 12-minute VTP treatment and those in the control 
group were instructed to perform twice-daily, 10-minute 
warm compress, and eyelid hygiene treatment of both 
eyes for 3 months, which was standardized using the OTC 
EyeGiene® Insta-Warmth™ System (Eyedetec Medical, 
Inc. Danville, CA, USA) and OCuSOFT® Lid Scrub™ 
Original (OCuSoft, Rosenberg, TX, USA). Control subjects 
documented daily therapy use on a diary. In stage 1, treat-
ment and control group subjects were followed at 1 and 
3 months after the treatment visit. After the 3-month exam, 
control subjects were instructed to stop the control therapy 
and received crossover VTP treatment. In stage 2, treatment 
group subjects were followed at 6, 9, and 12 months. Control 
subjects who became crossover group subjects were followed 
at 4, 6, 9, and 12 months. The complete subject disposition is 
given in the form of an abbreviated Consolidated Standards 
of Reporting Trials flow diagram in Figure 1.
During the study, the use of any prescribed medication 
or treatment as deemed necessary by the physician to alle-
viate an adverse event was allowed. In addition, subjects 
were permitted the use of OTC supplements during the 
study. No prescription MGD or dry eye treatment was 
permitted for treatment group subjects for the first 3 months 
and for control/crossover group subjects through the first 
6 months. In stage 2, subjects were assessed at each visit for 
adequacy of symptom relief to determine which subgroup 
the subjects entered for the subsequent visit. Subjects who 
reported adequate symptom relief remained in the one VTP 
subgroup, and no additional treatment was prescribed until 
the next visit, when the adequacy of symptom relief was 
assessed again. Subjects who reported inadequate symp-
tom relief were provided either a second VTP treatment 
(two VTP subgroups) or other MGD and dry eye treat-
ment (combination subgroup). If the subject self-initiated 
other MGD or dry eye treatment during the study (except 
for OTC supplements), the subject was entered into the 
combination subgroup and was no longer eligible for a 
second VTP treatment. For the combination subgroup, 
the type of other MGD or dry eye treatments prescribed 
by the physician included warm compress, lid hygiene, 
lid massage, systemic antibiotic, topical antibiotic, and 
topical steroid.

VTp procedure for MGD and evaporative dry eye
The lipiFlow® System
The LipiFlow® Vectored Thermal Pulsation System is a 
prescription device intended for the application of local-
ized heat and pressure therapy in adult patients with 
chronic cystic conditions of the eyelids, including MGD, 
also known as evaporative dry eye or lipid deficiency dry 
eye. The LipiFlow® System is used by a physician in an 
in-office procedure to provide controlled heat to the inner 
eyelid surface and intermittent pressure to the outer eyelid 
to facilitate release of lipid from the glands. The device has 
been described in detail elsewhere.20
Study parameters
Study effectiveness endpoint parameters were Meibomian 
Gland Assessment and the OSDI Questionnaire. Meibomian 
gland assessment was performed using a handheld instru-
ment, Meibomian Gland Evaluator, to apply standardized 
pressure to the eyelid margin, which simulates a blink in 
yielding gland secretions. A total of 15 glands were evalu-
ated along the lower eyelid margin, consisting of five glands 
located in each of the temporal, central, and nasal regions. 
For each of the 15 glands, expressed secretion character-
istics were graded as 3 (clear liquid secretion), 2 (cloudy 
liquid secretion), 1 (inspissated/toothpaste consistency), and 
0 (no secretion). For data analysis, the MGS score for each 
eye was calculated based on the sum of the secretion grades 
for all 15 glands evaluated with a range of 0 to 45.
The OSDI questionnaire assessed the subjects’ frequency 
of dry eye symptoms and problems with their eyes in situa-
tions and conditions of daily living. The dry eye questionnaire 
was explained to the subjects prior to completion to ensure 
understanding of the instructions without coaching or influ-
encing the subjects’ responses. The subjects completed the 
questionnaire directly and signed and dated the form. The 
OSDI score was calculated as the sum of frequency scores 
for all symptoms multiplied by 25 and divided by the number 
of questions answered with a range from 0 to 100.33
Study endpoints
Stage 1 primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints were 
to compare the mean change from baseline to 3 months in 
MGS and OSDI scores, respectively, between the treatment 
and control groups. Stage 2 primary and secondary effec-
tiveness endpoints were to evaluate the sustained treatment 
effect at 6 and 12 months based on the mean MGS score and 
mean OSDI score, respectively, with comparison between 
the stage 2 subgroups. There was no safety endpoint in this 
study because the LipiFlow® System is a nonsignificant risk 
device and safety has been demonstrated through a previous 
study.20 However, adverse event data were collected at all 
study visits.
Study populations
Three populations were used for analysis. 1) The intention-
to-treat (ITT) population included all subjects who were ran-
domized in the study and was used for analysis of the stage 1 
primary and secondary endpoints and adverse events. 2) The 
per protocol (PP) population, which included all subjects who 
completed stage 1 with no significant protocol deviations that 
could affect the effectiveness endpoints, was also used for 
stage 1 endpoint analyses. Control subjects who did not meet 
the minimum acceptable compliance for use of the control 
therapy as defined in the protocol were excluded from the 
PP population. Of the control subjects who completed the 
3-month visit, 84.0% met the minimum acceptable compli-
ance. 3) The completed cases (CC) population included all 
subjects who completed 12 months and was analyzed for the 
stage 2 primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC, USA) software version 9.2. A comparability 
analysis by treatment group was performed for demographics 
(age, sex, race, and ethnicity) and baseline characteristics 
(MGS score, OSDI score, duration of dry eye symptoms and 
duration of dry eye, or MGD diagnosis). Wilcoxon rank sum 
test was used for comparison of continuous variables. For 
categorical variables, Fisher’s exact test or Fisher–Freeman–
Halton test was used. A P,0.1 was used to determine 
imbalance between groups. Any significant variables were 
included in supportive multivariate models of study endpoints 
to control for the imbalance.
To assess poolability of the multicenter data, a multivari-
ate mixed models analysis of variance of the stage 1 primary 
and secondary effectiveness endpoints was employed to 
test whether a site by treatment group interaction existed. 
A two-sided test with a P-value ,0.10 was used to determine 
a significant site by treatment interaction. If the effect size 
was homogeneous by site, the stage 1 endpoint was analyzed 
by a two-sample t-test. If the effect size was heterogeneous 
by site, the overall effect size across sites for the stage 1 
endpoint was obtained by taking the weighted average of 
the difference in scores between groups at each site, using 
the inverse of the variance of the difference in scores as the

weight, and dividing the sum of these weighted differences 
by the sum of the weights. The test of significance was a 
z-statistic. To avoid multiplicity issues, the stage 1 primary 
and secondary endpoints were tested in order under a closed 
form testing method. The secondary hypothesis was tested 
only if the primary hypothesis was statistically significant. 
If both hypotheses were statistically significant, the overall 
study alpha is 0.025.
Supportive multivariate generalized linear mixed models 
for the stage 1 endpoints were analyzed with covariates, 
including treatment group, demographics, baseline charac-
teristics, and any variables found to be out of balance from 
the comparability analyses. The data were modeled based 
on subject as the independent unit of measure to account for 
any clustering and correlation between right and left eyes of 
each subject.
Stage 2 primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints 
were analyzed with a multivariable mixed model with stage 2 
subgroup as a fixed effect. Covariates for the model included 
treatment group, demographics, and baseline characteristics. 
Stage 2 endpoints were analyzed at 12 months with compari-
son of the one VTP subgroup to the combination subgroup 
only because there were too few subjects in the two VTP 
subgroup (n=3 subjects) at 12 months for meaningful analy-
sis. Stage 2 endpoints were not analyzed at 6 months because 
there were too few subjects in the two VTP (n=1 subject) 
and combination (n=6 subjects) subgroups at 6 months for 
a meaningful comparative analysis.
Exploratory analyses included analysis of the sustained 
effect by assessing the mean change in MGS and OSDI 
scores from baseline to 12 months using a paired t-test and 
the CC population of the one VTP subgroup in the treat-
ment and crossover groups. In addition, to determine patient 
characteristics significantly associated with greater MGS 
improvement after VTP treatment, the change in MGS score 
from baseline to 3 months was analyzed for the treatment 
group using a multivariate mixed model and the ITT popula-
tion. Model covariates included demographics and baseline 
characteristics.
Results
The mean age of the subjects was 56.2±15.3 years (range: 
22 to 85 years) with 71% females. Most subjects were of 
non-Hispanic or non-Latino ethnicity (93.0%) and White 
or Caucasian race (97.0%). There were no statistically 
significant differences (P.0.10) in demographics, baseline 
total MGS score or duration of MGD, or dry eye diagnosis 
between the treatment and control groups (Table 1). The 
retention of subjects over the study duration was excellent. 
Of the 200 randomized subjects, 192 (96.0% accountability) 
completed stage 1 (3 months) and 186 (93.0% accountability) 
completed stage 2 (12 months).
Stage 1 primary and secondary 
effectiveness endpoints
Table 2 displays the mean change in MGS score and OSDI 
score for the treatment and control groups from baseline to 
3 months for the ITT and PP populations. The treatment 
group had a statistically significant greater mean improve-
ment in MGS score (P,0.0001) between baseline and 
3 months as compared to the control group after accounting 
for heterogeneity across sites. Furthermore, the treatment 
group had a statistically significant greater mean reduction 
in OSDI score (P=0.0068 for ITT population; P=0.0018 for 
PP population) between baseline and 3 months as compared 
to the control group. In the supportive multivariate models 
of the stage 1 endpoints controlling for demographic and 
baseline covariates (including imbalanced variables from the 
comparability analysis), the treatment group showed a statis-
tically significant greater mean improvement in MGS score

VTp procedure for MGD and evaporative dry eye
(P=0.0020) and OSDI score (P=0.0419) between baseline 
and 3 months as compared to the control group.
Stage 2 primary and secondary 
effectiveness endpoints
Stage 2 subgroup classification and posttreatment care 
regimen depended upon the subject’s report of adequacy 
of symptom relief at 3, 6, and 9 months for treatment 
group subjects and at 6 and 9 months for crossover group 
subjects. Most treatment group subjects remained in the 
one VTP subgroup at 6 months (94.8%), 9 months (87.2%), 
and 12 months (86.2%). Similarly, most crossover group 
subjects remained in the one VTP subgroup at 6 months 
(97.8%), 9 months (90.2%), and 12 months (89.1%). Subjects 
with inadequate symptom relief moved from the one VTP 
subgroup to the two VTP and/or combination subgroups 
over time. At 12 months, 11.7% and 9.8% of subjects in the 
treatment and crossover groups, respectively, were in the 
combination subgroup, and 2.1% and 1.1% of subjects in 
the treatment and crossover groups, respectively, were in 
the two VTP subgroup.
Table 3 displays the mean MGS score and mean OSDI 
score at 12 months with comparison between the one VTP 
and combination subgroups for the CC population. In the 
multivariate model controlling for other covariates, there was 
no statistically significant difference in the 12-month mean 
MGS score between one VTP and combination subgroups 
(P=0.9098). Conversely, the one VTP subgroup had a sta-
tistically significantly lower (less dry eye symptoms) mean 
OSDI score at 12 months as compared to the combination 
subgroup (P=0.0237), after controlling for the baseline 
OSDI score and other covariates in the multivariate model. 
No significant difference was found between treatment and 
crossover groups at 12 months in MGS score (P=0.7062) or 
OSDI score (P=0.8773), supporting comparable outcomes 
in the treatment and crossover groups.
Sustained effect over 12 months
For the 12-month cohort (CC population) of the one VTP 
subgroup in both the treatment and crossover groups, the 
mean MGS score over time is shown in Figure 2 and the mean 
OSDI score over time is shown in Figure 3. The treatment 
group received only one VTP treatment and no other pre-
scribed MGD or dry eye therapy. The results reflect a signifi-
cant and sustained mean improvement in MGS score from 
baseline to 12 months (6.4±3.7 to 17.3±9.1; P,0.0001) for 
the 86.2% of treatment group subjects who received only 
one VTP treatment through 12 months. Furthermore, a sig-
nificant and sustained mean reduction in OSDI score from 
baseline to 12 months (44.1±20.4 to 21.6±21.3; P,0.0001) 
was observed in treatment group subjects who received only 
one VTP treatment from baseline to 12 months.
The crossover group received 3 months of twice-daily 
warm compress and eyelid hygiene control therapy, fol-
lowed by only one VTP treatment and no other prescribed 
MGD or dry eye therapy. While the mean MGS improved 
from baseline after 3 months of control therapy (6.3±3.6 to 
11.0±8.0), the mean MGS improved further 1 month after

crossover treatment at 4 months (18.5±10.3), similar to the 
1 month mean for the treatment group. For the 89.1% of 
crossover subjects who received only one VTP® treatment 
through 12 months, there was significant and consistent 
mean improvement from baseline to 12 months in MGS 
score (6.3±3.6 to 18.4±11.1; P,0.0001) and OSDI score 
(44.1±20.4 to 21.6±21.3; P,0.0001).
patient characteristics associated with 
MGS improvement
Baseline patient characteristics that significantly associated 
with greater improvement in MGS score from baseline to 
3 months after VTP treatment based on simple univariate 
models included: higher (less severe) baseline MGS score 
(P=0.0007), shorter duration of dry eye or MGD diagnosis 
(P=0.0059), previous history of chalazia (P=0.0271), and 
shorter duration of dry eye symptoms (P=0.0273). In the mul-
tivariate mixed model, only baseline MGS score (P=0.0017) 
and duration of dry eye or MGD diagnosis (P=0.0378) 
remained significantly associated with the mean change in 
MGS score from baseline to 3 months. Specifically, subjects 
with a less severe baseline MGD and/or shorter duration of 
time from diagnosis to treatment had a greater mean improve-
ment in MGS score between baseline and 3 months.
Although duration of dry eye symptoms was not signifi-
cant in the multivariate model, the data show the same trend

adverse events
There were no serious device-related adverse events and no 
unanticipated adverse device effects reported in the study. 
All device-related adverse events were anticipated, transient, 
nonserious ocular events that resolved without sequelae. 
There were 19 device-related events, including ten related 
to VTP® treatment, eight related to control therapy, and 
one related to a study procedure (combination treatment use) 
reported in 16 subjects (26 eyes). VTP®-related events were 
reported for 5.1% of subjects (3.9% of eyes) who attempted 
VTP® or crossover VTP® treatment. Control-related events 
were reported for 7.1% of subjects (6.6% of eyes) who used 
control therapy. The most common device-related event by 
type was eye/eyelid discomfort/pain (1.5%) for all VTP®-
treated eyes and eyelid skin dermatitis (1.5%) for control 
group eyes.
Discussion
The goal of treatment for MGD is to improve meibomian 
gland function. Intrinsic to the definition of MGD is gland 
obstruction.4,5 Thus, treatment should primarily involve the 
evacuation of stagnated gland contents.17 Supplementary 
therapy, which includes front surface lid heating in various 
forms, lid margin scrubs, lid margin debridement-scaling, 
and additional disease comanagement, can then help maintain 
the improvement of gland function achieved by evacuating 
the gland contents.4,5,11,17,36 The conventional method of 
evacuating stagnated contents is to manually express the 
glands. Although the procedure is effective, it is painful and 
needs to be repeated several times a year.26
LipiFlow® System is an innovative, automated VTP 
system, which overcomes the limitations of conventional 
methods and offers an effective treatment for meibomian 
gland obstruction. The device safely delivers a therapeutic 
level of heat to the palpebral surfaces of the upper and 
lower eyelids directly over the meibomian glands while 
graded pulsatile pressure simultaneously evacuates the 
meibomian glands during heating.17 The single, 12-minute 
in-office treatment has been found to be highly effective in 
the treatment of MGD and associated evaporative dry eye 
by increasing meibomian gland function, thereby improv-
ing tear break-up time, tear film stability and reducing dry 
eye symptoms.17
The active control in this study was standardized, twice-
daily warm compress and eyelid hygiene based on the 
recommended standard of care for MGD and evaporative 
dry eye.36 The study results (Table 2) indicate that after 
3 months, a single 12-minute VTP treatment was signifi-
cantly more effective in improving meibomian gland func-
tion and reducing dry eye symptoms than twice-daily warm 
compress application combined with eyelid hygiene. This 
significant difference between treatment and control groups 
in these outcomes was maintained after controlling for patient 
demographic and baseline characteristics in the multivariate

analysis. These results in a larger population concur with a 
prior report showing the efficacy of a single VTP treatment 
compared to a similar conventional control after 3 months of 
daily at-home therapy.30 While it was not possible to mask the 
patients to the therapy, a significant limitation of this study is 
that the investigators were not masked. In a prior study where 
the investigators were masked, the results of the treatment 
were clinically and statistically significant.30
The sustained effect of the single VTP treatment, with 
respect to meibomian gland function and dry eye symptoms, 
was evaluated over a 12-month period. With excellent study 
retention (93%), a high percentage, 86.2%, of treatment group 
subjects and 89.1% of crossover subjects remained in the one 
VTP subgroup until 12 months. Both treatment and crossover 
group subjects demonstrated consistent mean improvement in 
MGS score, as well as a sustained mean reduction in OSDI 
score over the 12-month study period (Figures 2 and 3). These 
patients did not receive any additional prescribed therapy for 
MGD or dry eye to further ameliorate their symptoms after 
the initial single VTP® treatment. This clinical trial lasted 
twice as long as a prior randomized controlled trial, which 
followed the patients who had received a single VTP treat-
ment out to 6 months and also showed a sustained effect of 
the single treatment.31
In a prior report, structural gland loss in excess of 
67% resulted in relatively reduced symptomatic relief and 
improvement in gland function compared to that of patients 
who had retained 33% or more of their gland structure.30 
In the current study, gland imaging was not utilized to evalu-
ate the structural integrity of the glands prior to treatment. 
While the correlation between gland structure and gland 
function is weak, gland imaging should be an integral part of 
any MGD workup to assist in the setting of expectations for 
treatment based on the findings of the prior report.30,31
MGD is understood to be a chronic progressive 
disease.17,37 Later stage disease increases the likelihood of 
irreversible anatomical changes, for example, rounding of 
posterior lid margin, conjunctivalization of Marx’s line, 
meibomian gland truncation, or atrophy.38 A reasonable 
prediction would be that early intervention for MGD would 
lead to improved treatment outcomes and this view has been 
previously presented.3,17 As predicted, the effect of disease 
chronicity is demonstrated by the significant association 
between greater mean improvement in MGS score between 
baseline and 3 months and the patient characteristics of 
shorter duration of MGD or dry eye diagnosis and less severe 
baseline MGD. These results support the view that early inter-
vention improves treatment outcomes for MGD, as measured 
by improvement in gland function. In addition, the baseline 
mean duration of dry eye symptoms was 1.6 years longer than 
the mean duration of diagnosis in the treatment group and 
3.2 years longer in the control group (Table 1), reflecting that 
many patients are not diagnosed with MGD until after they 
are symptomatic for some time. Early intervention requires 
early detection, and patients should be routinely assessed for 
MGD even in the absence of dry eye symptoms.
In this study, a small percentage of patients received 
additional prescribed therapy (combination or two VTP treat-
ments) for further symptom relief through 12 months. In the 
comparison of outcomes for subjects who received only one 
VTP treatment versus those who received combination treat-
ment, there was no significant difference in the mean MGS 
score but the one VTP subjects had a statistically significantly 
lower mean OSDI score (less symptoms) at 12 months. Not 
surprisingly, the combination subjects, who were selected 
into this subgroup based on inadequate symptom relief, had 
more severe baseline dry eye symptoms on average than 
the one VTP subjects. In addition, the combination subjects 
were often not compliant with their prescribed therapy, thus 
limiting the conclusions that we can draw regarding these 
subjects. However, as other MGD or dry therapy did not 
further improve the mean MGS score in the combination 
subgroup, it is likely that factors other than MGD specifi-
cally were contributing to the greater dry eye symptoms at 
12 months. This is not atypical of patients with chronic dry 
eye where multiple therapies may be indicated.22
The safety of the LipiFlow® System has been previously 
evaluated and reported.20 The type and rate of nonserious and 
transient adverse events related to the LipiFlow® System in 
this trial were consistent with prior studies.
Conclusion
A single VTP treatment can deliver a sustained effect over 
1 year, as shown by mean improvement in meibomian gland 
function and mean reduction in dry eye symptoms from 
baseline. These results also show that most patients, 86.2%, 
did not receive additional prescribed therapy for symptom 
relief after a single VTP treatment during the 12-month 
study period. Furthermore, a single VTP treatment provides 
significantly greater mean improvement in meibomian 
gland function and dry eye symptoms as compared to a 
robust, conventional regimen used twice-daily for 3 months. 
These results also suggest that early intervention for MGD 
improves treatment outcomes. This study strongly supports 
a previously published perspective that no other single dose 
therapy offers a comparable efficacy profile for reducing dry 
eye symptoms and improving meibomian gland function as 
well as VTP for MGD.17
