Abstract
Background: models projecting future disease burden have focussed on one or two diseases. Little is known on how risk
factors of younger cohorts will play out in the future burden of multi-morbidity (two or more concurrent long-term
conditions).
Design: a dynamic microsimulation model, the Population Ageing and Care Simulation (PACSim) model, simulates the
characteristics (sociodemographic factors, health behaviours, chronic diseases and geriatric conditions) of individuals over
the period 2014–2040.
Population: about 303,589 individuals aged 35 years and over (a 1% random sample of the 2014 England population) created
from Understanding Society, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II.
Main outcome measures: the prevalence of, numbers with, and years lived with, chronic diseases, geriatric conditions and
multi-morbidity.
Results: between 2015 and 2035, multi-morbidity prevalence is estimated to increase, the proportion with 4+ diseases
almost doubling (2015:9.8%; 2035:17.0%) and two-thirds of those with 4+ diseases will have mental ill-health (dementia,
depression, cognitive impairment no dementia). Multi-morbidity prevalence in incoming cohorts aged 65–74 years will rise
(2015:45.7%; 2035:52.8%). Life expectancy gains (men 3.6 years, women: 2.9 years) will be spent mostly with 4+ diseases
(men: 2.4 years, 65.9%; women: 2.5 years, 85.2%), resulting from increased prevalence of rather than longer survival with
multi-morbidity.
Conclusions: our findings indicate that over the next 20 years there will be an expansion of morbidity, particularly complex
multi-morbidity (4+ diseases). We advocate for a new focus on prevention of, and appropriate and efficient service provi-
sion for those with, complex multi-morbidity.

Introduction
Healthcare delivery was built, and generally remains centred,
on the treatment of single diseases. Over the last decade, the
growing number of older people (aged 65 years and over) has
become a considerable challenge to health and social care ser-
vice provision and funding, as over 50% have at least two
chronic conditions (multi-morbidity) [1, 2]. Moreover num-
bers of the very old, aged 85 years and over, are set to dou-
ble over the next 20 years [3], with multi-morbidity the
norm in this age group [4]. Multi-morbidity increases the
likelihood of hospital admission, length of stay and readmis-
sion, raises healthcare costs, reduces quality of life, and
increases dependency, polypharmacy and mortality [2, 5]. In

 addition to multi-morbidity, many of the very old have sen-
sory impairment and incontinence [4], making a single
disease-focused model of healthcare unsuitable [6].
Poor health behaviours such as obesity and physical
inactivity are risk factors common to a number of diseases,
but have received little attention as risk factors for multi-
morbidity [5]. Younger cohorts have a higher prevalence of
obesity than their equivalents a generation ago [7], which may
contribute to the increased prevalence of multi-morbidity in
those under 65 years of age [1]. A systematic review suggests
that better risk factor management could be the key to
improving outcomes for people with multi-morbidity [8].
This is in keeping with NICE guidelines for reshaping treat-
ment for people with multi-morbidity in an all-inclusive
framework, with care package delivery accounting for indivi-
duals’ disease profiles as a whole [9]. Other risk factors for
disease have improved in recent decades, with higher levels of
education in more recent cohorts contributing to the reduc-
tion in prevalence and incidence of dementia [10].
The contribution of younger cohorts with multi-morbidity
as they age into the older population, along with growing
numbers of the very old, could dramatically increase the
health and social care burden in the coming years [11].
However, reliable projections of the prevalence of, and num-
bers with, multi-morbidity are lacking since, to date, projec-
tion models have focussed either on a single disease (such
as coronary heart disease, dementia, or diabetes) [12–14]; on
a combination of two diseases (cardiovascular disease and
dementia) [15]; or on risk factors (such as obesity and phys-
ical activity) rather than disease [16]. The aim of this paper
is to examine how key long-term conditions and multi-
morbidity will evolve between 2015 and 2035 in the popula-
tion aged 65 years and over in England, using a new
dynamic microsimulation model, Population Ageing and
Care Simulation (PACSim).
Methods
Model design
We developed a discrete time dynamic microsimulation
model PACSim, based on a similar dynamic microsimula-
tion model DYNOPTASim [17] and a previous macrosi-
mulation model [18]. PACSim simulates the survival and
characteristics (disease and associated risk factors) of a set
of real individuals (the base population) as they age over
time, to estimate future prevalence, incidence, and life and
health expectancies. Movements between states of each
characteristic are determined by applying age, sex and state-
specific transition probabilities derived from longitudinal
data. Here we provide brief details of the overall design of
PACSim and the construction of the base population; fur-
ther information is available online [19].
Data sources
Three surveys were combined to create the base population
of PACSim: Understanding Society wave 1; the English
Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) wave 5; and the
Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) II. To enable
projections to be made for the population aged 65 years
and over up to 2040, the base population includes indivi-
duals aged 35 years and over.
Sociodemographic and health states
Individual characteristics included in PACSim and relevant
for this paper fall into three broad categories: sociodemo-
graphic (age, sex, marital status, education, socio-economic
status); health behaviours (smoking status, physical inactivity,
BMI); chronic diseases and geriatric conditions (CHD, stroke,
hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, cancer, respiratory disease,
dementia, depression, hearing impairment, vision impairment
and cognitive impairment). With the exception of dementia,
chronic
diseases
were
self-report
of
doctor-diagnosis.
Dementia status was only available in CFAS and was there-
fore allocated probabilistically, and outwith the simulation,
conditional on age group, MMSE category and community/
care home residence. Vision and hearing impairments were
self-report of current condition and cognitive impairment was
defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score
[20] 0–20. Fuller details of data, harmonisation and imput-
ation of missing values are given in online [19].
Individuals’ characteristics are updated monthly over the
full time period of the simulation to achieve a more realistic
evolution for characteristics which jointly influence each other.
All characteristics are stochastic apart from sex, education and
socio-economic status which are fixed, and age which is deter-
ministic. Transition models for stochastic characteristics were
calculated by fitting binary, ordinal or generalised logistic regres-
sion models (dependent upon the characteristic) to the base
and 2-year follow-up waves of the combined studies (prior to
any imputation for missing values). The coefficients of each
model were applied to current characteristics to produce the 2-
year probability of moving to a given state; this was converted
to a monthly probability. Details of the risk factors included in
each transition model are shown in the online report (Table 2)
[19]. Dementia did not contribute as an explanatory variable
for transition probabilities as dementia status was allocated after
the simulation. Monthly survival probabilities were derived
from the annual probabilities underlying the 2014-based princi-
pal population projection for England [3].
Model validation
Agreement between the numbers in 5-year age groups at each
year of the simulation to the Office for National Statistics
2014 projections for England were good (online report
Figure 2) [19]. The age–sex-specific prevalence of stroke, dia-
betes, current smoking, overweight and obesity from PACSim
were compared with those from the Health Survey for
England 2014 [21] (online report Table 4) [19]. Generally,
there was good agreement apart from the prevalence of obes-
ity where PACSim prevalence was lower by around 8 percent-
age points for men aged 35–64 and for women of all ages.

 Model outputs
We defined multi-morbidity in two ways: diseases only; and
diseases and impairments (vision, hearing, and cognitive
impairment no dementia (CIND)—defined as MMSE 0–20
but no dementia), with both measures categorised as none, 1,
2, 3 and 4+ diseases/impairments. Years with and without a
disease (or impairment or multi-morbidity) were calculated by
year of projection using Sullivan’s method [22], i.e. by apply-
ing the age–sex-specific prevalence of the disease/impairment
to the age–sex-specific lifetable population generated from
the survival probabilities. In addition, using decomposition
techniques we derived the relative contributions of rising
prevalence of multi-morbidity and increasing life expectancy
to changes between 2015 and 2035 in expected years lived
with multi-morbidity after age 65 years [23].
Results presented in this paper are predominantly from
a single run of PACSim over the time period 2014 to 2035,
with the range of values over 10 simulations provided for
selected outcomes.
Data harmonisation for the three studies was under-
taken in STATA version 12.1, while PACSim was imple-
mented in SAS version 9.4.
Results
Between 2015 and 2035 increases of more than 50% are
projected in the number of older people affected by most
individual diseases and impairments, the largest increases
being for numbers having cancer (179.4%) and diabetes
(118.1%) (Table 1); exceptions are CHD (22.1%), depression
(−15.1%) and CIND (25.6%). Arthritis and cancer will see
the greatest rise in prevalence of 14.0 and 15.1 percentage
points respectively. In the 85+ age group, all diseases apart
from dementia and depression more than double in abso-
lute numbers between 2015 and 2035 (see Appendix
Table 1 in the Supplementary data, available in Age and
Ageing online).
Multi-morbidity
Over half (54.0%) of the population aged 65+ in 2015 have
two
or
more
diseases.
As
expected,
multi-morbidity
increases with age: in 2015, from 45.7% for those aged
65–74 to 68.7% for those aged 85+; and over time: to
64.4% in 2025 and 67.8% in 2035, for those aged 65+
(Table 2). When four or more diseases are considered, tem-
poral increases at age 65+ occur mostly at age 85+
(Table 2). Although the proportion of the young old (aged
65–74 years) with four or more diseases decreases slightly
over time (from 7.0% in 2015 to 6.5% in 2035), the preva-
lence of multi-morbidity (two or more diseases) is higher in
successive
young-old
cohorts:
from
45.7%
in
2015
(1941–1950 birth cohort) to 52.8% in 2035 (1961–1970
birth cohort) (Table 2). Similar patterns emerge when
multi-morbidity is defined by diseases or impairments (see
Appendix Table 2 in the Supplementary data, available in
Age and Ageing online).
The contribution of mental ill-health (defined as demen-
tia, depression or CIND) to the morbidity burden in 2015
rises strongly with the number of diseases or impairments,
with mental ill-health co-existing in 4.1% of those with one
other disease or impairment, to 34.1% of those with four
or more diseases or impairments (see Appendix Table 3 is
available in the Supplementary data, available in Age and
Ageing online). This pattern is projected to change little
between 2015 and 2035 although the contribution of mental
ill-health declines slightly over time (see Appendix Table 3 in
the Supplementary data, available in Age and Ageing online),
due to the declines in prevalence of depression and CIND
(Table 1).
Years lived with multi-morbidity
Life expectancy at age 65 for men in 2015 is 18.6 years of
which 9.9 years (53.2%) on average will be spent with multi-
morbidity (two or more diseases) and 1.9 years (10.0%) with

 four or more diseases. Women’s life expectancy is longer
(21.2 years) with more years spent with two or more
diseases (12.2 years, 57.5%) and four or more diseases
(2.2 years, 10.6%) (see Appendix Figure 1A in the
Supplementary data, available in Age and Ageing online). In
2015, most of the remaining years for both sexes will be
spent with one or two diseases. Between 2015 and 2035
average years lived free of or with one disease are projected
to decrease, and years with multi-morbidity to increase, par-
ticularly years with four or more diseases which will double
(see Appendix Figure 1A in the Supplementary data, avail-
able in Age and Ageing online). Similar patterns are seen if
impairments are included, though years spent with four or
more conditions will form most of the remaining years for
both sexes by 2035 (see Appendix Figure 1B in the
Supplementary data, available in Age and Ageing online).
The gain in life expectancy at age 65 between 2015 and
2035 (men: 3.6 years, women: 2.9 years) comprises a reduc-
tion in years spent with no or one disease and an increase
in years spent with two or more diseases (men: 5.5 years,
women: 5.0 years) and with four or more diseases (men:
2.4 years; women: 2.5 years) (Figure 1). The gain in years
lived with two or more diseases will be almost equally a
result of longer survival with, and increased prevalence of,
multi-morbidity. However, the gain in years lived with four
or more diseases will be mainly due to an increased preva-
lence of multi-morbidity (men: 64.2%, women: 68.4%) (see
Appendix Table 4 in the Supplementary data, available in
Age and Ageing online).
Sensitivity analyses
In addition to the results presented above derived from a
single run of PACSim, a further nine simulations were per-
formed (total n = 10). The range in the prevalence of
multi-morbidity (defined as two or more diseases, and four
or more diseases) were small at less than one percentage

 point (Appendix Table 5 in the Supplementary data, avail-
able in Age and Ageing online), as were the ranges in life
expectancy and years spent with multi-morbidity at age 65
(Appendix Table 6 in the Supplementary data, available in
Age and Ageing online).
Discussion
PACSim provides, for the first time, projections of a range
of fatal and non-fatal chronic diseases and geriatric condi-
tions conditional on the sociodemographic characteristics,
health behaviours and existing morbidities of a real popula-
tion aged 35 years and over as they age. We estimate that,
over the next 20 years, there will be greater numbers of old-
er people aged 65 years and over, both with individual dis-
eases and with multi-morbidity, particularly with four or
more diseases for which numbers will double, as will num-
bers with cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes. In add-
ition, around a third of those with four or more morbidities
will have mental ill-health (depression, dementia or cogni-
tive impairment with no dementia). There will be an expan-
sion of morbidity, with the gain in life expectancy at age 65
between 2015 and 2035 (3.6 years for men, 2.9 years for
women) being less than the gain in years spent with multi-
morbidity (5.5 years for men, 5.0 years for women), and
two-thirds or more of the gain in life expectancy will be
spent with four or more diseases. These findings suggest a
new focus on those with four or more long-term conditions
which we will term ‘complex multi-morbidity’.
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge PACSim includes more major chronic dis-
eases than any other microsimulation model, thereby enabling
a realistic prediction of the future burden of multi-morbidity.
Limitations are focussed around the morbidities included, the
time period for calculation of transitions, the assumptions
underlying the transitions and the lack of confidence intervals.
Firstly, most of the morbidities are self-reported, though all
three surveys ascertained doctor-diagnosed disease. The
exception to self-reported morbidities are cognitive impair-
ment and dementia, both of which were only available in
CFAS and therefore were imputed for participants in the two
other surveys. Although PACSim covers the main sociodemo-
graphic and lifestyle risk factors for disease, inclusion of other
factors was limited by incomparability of items across the
three surveys. Secondly, the transition rates for all characteris-
tics were based upon observations from two consecutive
waves of each survey, a time period of around 2 years. A long-
er time period might provide more precise estimates of coeffi-
cients in the transition models but we were constrained by
CFAS having only two waves and yet being crucial for provid-
ing information on dementia and cognitive impairment.
Thirdly, the model assumes that transitions between states of
all characteristics are independent of time, though incorporat-
ing time-varying transitions is a future possibility. Finally, pro-
viding confidence intervals around all outcomes that account
for the error in the transition rates is non-trivial in a dynamic
microsimulation model with as many outcomes and character-
istics as PACSim. However running the simulation multiple
times has provided evidence that the range of the prevalence
of multi-morbidity is small (less than one percentage point)
albeit when the error in the transition rates is ignored.
Strengths include that: PACSim is based on three large, nation-
ally representative surveys; baseline disease prevalence is
broadly comparable with the Health Survey for England 2014
[21]; basing the simulation on monthly transitions which pro-
vides more realistic evolutions of characteristics that are co-
dependent; and the ability to add scenarios which will allow us
to see the effect of future interventions.
PACSim improves upon our earlier macrosimulation mod-
el [18] and other models by including real younger individuals
with their own health and disease characteristics, rather than
assuming that incoming cohorts to the older population have
the same characteristics as previous cohorts at 65 years. The
higher education levels of real younger cohorts may have a
positive effect on some conditions (i.e. lower prevalence) [10],
while their higher levels of obesity are likely to have negative
consequences [7]. Other projection models assume trends in
disease will continue [15]. Given our findings of an increase in
multi-morbidity prevalence over time, such assumptions will
overestimate the years lived with no or one disease (or impair-
ment) and underestimate the years spent with four or more
conditions.
Comparisons with other studies
Comparisons of the prevalence of multi-morbidity between
studies is difficult due to the number and definition of dis-
eases and the age groups included [1, 5]. Nevertheless, our
estimate of the prevalence of multi-morbidity of 54% in those
aged 65 years and over in 2015 in England is in keeping with
others [1]. Risk factors and the prevalence of individual dis-
eases differ between countries, but multi-morbidity is an
increasing challenge for all countries, not least low- and
middle-income countries (LMIC) in which populations are
ageing much more rapidly than in high-income countries [24].
Indeed our finding of a greater likelihood of poor mental
health with multi-morbidity, particularly four or more dis-
eases, confirms findings for LMICs [24].
Policy implications
Geriatricians have long recognised the challenges of multi-
morbidity in balancing treatment and intervention options
with quality of life and function, particularly in very old and
frail people. However, healthcare policy in England has
transferred chronic disease management from specialist ser-
vices to primary care, which through initiatives such as the
Quality Outcomes Framework [25] has reinforced a long-
standing single-disease paradigm, an approach which does
not adequately address the needs of older people. For
example, the application of single-disease guidelines from the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)

 for an older person with five conditions (Type 2 diabetes,
previous myocardial infarction, osteoarthritis, COPD and
depression) may result in a minimum of 11 medications
(with up to 10 other drugs routinely recommended), 8–10
routine primary care appointments and 4–6 GP appoint-
ments, as well as multiple self-care/lifestyle modifications
[26]. Moreover, these findings are not restricted to England,
nor to older people: similar levels of polypharmacy and
healthcare visits are reported in the US for those in mid-life
(aged 45–64 years) with three chronic conditions [27]. The
recent NICE guidelines for management of multi-morbidity
are, therefore, welcome, especially as they aim to involve
patients’ goals and preferences in clinical decision-making
[28], though implementation will require training, longer con-
sultations and more funding as primary care, not only in
England, is already over-stretched [29].
Our findings indicate that over the next 20 years, the
extra years spent with multi-morbidity after age 65 will
exceed the gains in life expectancy with an expansion of
morbidity, resulting in greater primary and secondary
healthcare utilisation [30]. There is also a pressing need to
consider the implications for social care, both from formal
care services and from unpaid family and other carers,
given the strong association between multi-morbidity and
reduced functional capacity [30].
We advocate renewed efforts on three fronts: primary
prevention by addressing mid- and later-life risk factors;
prevention of complex multi-morbidity by targeting older
people who have just acquired their second chronic condi-
tion; and more efficient future health and social service pro-
vision which is more appropriate for people with four or
more long-term conditions.
Key Points
• Between 2015 and 2035, numbers of older people with
4+ diseases will double and a third of these will have
mental ill-health.
• Two-thirds or more of the gain in years of life at age 65
will be years with 4+ long-term conditions (complex mul-
ti-morbidity).
• Our findings suggest the need for a focus on prevention
of, and service provision for those with, complex multi-
morbidity.

Council funded Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing
Research (CEPAR) project (2014–2017) on which C.J. was
an international partner. No funding body has had any
influence over the design of PACSim, the collection, ana-
lysis or interpretation of data, or the writing of this
manuscript.
