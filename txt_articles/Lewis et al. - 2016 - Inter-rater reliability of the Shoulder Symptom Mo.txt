ABSTRACT
Background: Musculoskeletal conditions involving the
shoulder are common and, because of the importance
of the upper limb and hand in daily function,
symptoms in this region are commonly associated with
functional impairment in athletic and non-athletic
populations. Deriving a definitive diagnosis as to the
cause of shoulder symptoms is fraught with difficulty.
Limitations have been recognised for imaging and for
orthopaedic special tests. 1 solution is to partially base
management on the response to tests aimed at
reducing the severity of the patient’s perception of
symptoms. 1 (of many) such tests is the Shoulder
Symptom Modification Procedure (SSMP). The
reliability of this procedure is unknown.
Methods: 37 clinician participants independently
watched the videos of 11 patient participants
undergoing the SSMP and recorded each patient’s
response as improved (partially or completely), no
change or worse. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by
Krippendorff’s α, which ranges from 0 to 1.
Results: Krippendorff’s α was found to range from
0.762 to 1.000, indicating moderate to substantial
reliability. In addition, short (3-hour) and longer
(1-day) durations of training were associated with
similar levels of reliability across the techniques.
Conclusions: Deriving a definitive structural diagnosis
for a person presenting with a musculoskeletal
condition involving the shoulder is difficult. The
findings of the present study suggest that the SSMP
demonstrates a high level of reliability. More research
is needed to better understand the relevance of such
procedures.
Trial registration number: ISRCTN95412360.
BACKGROUND
As a group, musculoskeletal conditions are
associated with the second highest number of
‘years
lived
with
disability’.1
Within
this
group,
conditions
affecting
the
shoulder
occur frequently in sporting and non-sporting
populations,2–4 and their prevalence increases
with age.5 Annually, 1–2% of the general
population present to their general practi-
tioner (family physician) with a first episode
of shoulder pain,6–8 and of concern, these
conditions are associated with high levels of
morbidity lasting for 1 year or longer.3 8
To understand the basis of the presenting
shoulder
symptoms,
clinicians
typically
perform
a
clinical
examination,
which
usually includes: taking a history, collecting
disability and impairment data and perform-
ing special orthopaedic tests that have been
designed to incriminate pathology, such as
that involving the rotator cuff tendons, suba-
cromial bursa or glenoid labrum, or to rule
in conditions, such as subacromial impinge-
ment syndrome.9
Although orthopaedic tests are commonly
used,9
findings
from
narrative10–13
and
systematic reviews14 15 and research investiga-
tions16 have consistently questioned the value
What are the new findings?
▪ Deriving a definitive structural diagnosis for
musculoskeletal conditions involving the shoul-
der is difficult.
▪ Symptom
improvement/correction/modification
tests have been suggested by clinicians as one
method
of
developing
a
management
programme.
▪ This study demonstrated inter-rater reliability of
the Shoulder Symptom Modification Procedure.
How might it impact on clinical practice in
the near future?
▪ A graduated exercise programme is the most
common form of management, for people with
the
majority
of
musculoskeletal
conditions
involving the shoulder.
▪ If future research demonstrates that techniques
used in the Shoulder Symptom Modification
Procedure confer additional benefit when incor-
porated into a graduated shoulder exercise pro-
gramme over exercises alone, then methods
such as these may have a role in the manage-
ment of musculoskeletal conditions involving the
shoulder.

 of these procedures as a method of implicating the
structures associated with the presenting symptoms.
Imaging is commonly used to support the clinical assess-
ment.17 Likewise, the certainty with which imaging find-
ings
support
or
confirm
the
clinical
diagnosis
is
challenged by myriad studies reporting asymptomatic
structural deficits, including full-thickness rotator cuff
tears and glenoid labral tears, in populations including
elite athletes.18–21 One implication of current clinical
practice is that people with shoulder pain may undergo
operations to repair tissues that are not related to their
presenting symptoms.13
The findings of these clinical and radiological investi-
gations have challenged the basis on which a structural
diagnosis may be achieved.10 13 22 This has been recog-
nised previously and researchers have suggested that
assessment and management could be based on the pre-
senting symptoms without the need for a definite struc-
tural diagnosis.23
24 One such model, known as the
Shoulder Symptom Modification Procedure (SSMP), was
first described by Lewis10 as a systematic approach to
assess clinical variables that may be associated with
shoulder symptoms, to determine their relationship with
the presenting symptoms. Similar to the Mulligan and
McKenzie et al approaches,23 24 procedures identified
that partially or completely improve the presenting
symptoms may be considered in patient management.
By placing the individual patient at the centre of the
assessment and management decision process, these
methods are compatible with patient-centred practice,
clinical reasoning and evidence-based practice.22 25 26
Shoulder Symptom Modification Procedure
The first stage of the SSMP is for the patient to identify
the movements, activities or postures that reproduce
symptoms. This may include symptoms experienced
while sitting at a desk, lifting a pan or kettle, dressing,
swimming, performing weight-bearing activities such as
push-ups and in high-powered explosive activities com-
monplace in sport. Pain is the most commonly reported
symptom, but symptoms may also include reduction in
movement, instability and symptoms that may be asso-
ciated with neurovascular compromise. Once defined,
the component parts of the SSMP are then applied while
the patient performs the symptom-provoking movements,
activities or postures to determine if an immediate
change is achievable. This type of ‘real-time’ process has
been recommended previously,23 24 and evidence (albeit
limited) suggests that procedures found to improve symp-
toms in the cervical and lumbar regions within a session
may be useful in guiding treatment selection and may
help predict between-session changes in symptoms.27–29
The SSMP comprises three main sections. The first
section aims to assess the relationship between thoracic
posture and symptoms, the second aims to evaluate the
effect of scapular position on symptoms and the third
aims to assess the effect of the relationship between the
humeral head and scapula on symptoms. In reality, the
assessment procedures do not isolate one structure. For
example, reducing the thoracic kyphosis also relatively
posteriorly tilts the scapula, changes length-tension rela-
tionships of muscles, tendons and related soft tissues
and may influence joint biomechanics. As all procedures
involve touch, another reason for perceiving a change in
symptoms may be the experience of this sensation.30
Additionally, there is only very limited evidence that
humeral head procedures actually influence humeral
head position.31
The SSMP assessment form is detailed in figure 1. The
specific assessment procedures have been described else-
where.10
11
13
Following
agreement
between
both
parties, the person with shoulder symptoms informs the
clinician if an individual procedure: partially or com-
pletely alleviates symptoms; has no change on symptoms;
or makes the symptoms worse. Techniques may be com-
bined; for example, if reducing the thoracic kyphosis
and elevating the scapula independently partially reduce
symptoms, then the clinician may assess the response of
combining both these procedures. If the SSMP com-
pletely and consistently alleviates symptoms, then the
procedures found to alleviate the symptoms are used to
inform treatment.
It is important for clinicians to appreciate that the
SSMP is not a stand-alone procedure and if the SSMP
does not change symptoms or only partially alleviates
them, other rehabilitation based on the clinician’s clin-
ical reasoning and the patient’s acceptance of that man-
agement
need
to
be
considered,
such
as
advice,
education, rotator cuff rehabilitation exercises,11 13 injec-
tion therapy or surgery.32 33
Although in clinical use,11 the reliability of the SSMP
is uncertain. The primary aim of this investigation was to
evaluate the intertester reliability of clinicians in deter-
mining how people with shoulder symptoms respond to
SSMP procedures. The secondary aim was to investigate
the differences in reliability between those that partici-
pated in long training (over 1 day) and short training
(3 hours) in the SSMP
. GRAAS recommendations for
reporting reliability studies were used as a guide.34
METHODS
Ethical approval and study registration
Ethical approval for the investigation was granted by the
Faculty of Education and Health Sciences Research
Ethics
Committee,
University
of
Limerick,
Ireland
(2015_12_13_EHS), and from the Health and Human
Sciences Ethics Committee, University of Hertfordshire,
UK. The investigation was registered—ISRCTN95412360.
Patients
A sample of convenience of 11 people with unilateral
shoulder pain, recruited from community and clinical
settings, consented to participate in the investigation.
They were provided with participant information docu-
mentation and informed of their rights, including the

 Clinicians
A sample of convenience of 40 clinicians from physio-
therapy and osteopathy were approached to participate
in the investigation.
Clinician participants worked in variety of health set-
tings, including the public and private sectors and in
primary and secondary care. They had varied training in
the SSMP
. Some had previous experience with the SSMP
and were using it in current clinical practice, while
others were new to the procedure. A number of clini-
cians had participated in previous training (∼1 day) and
to varying extents had incorporated the SSMP into their
clinical practice. Others were recruited for the purpose
of the investigation and received short training (3 hours
duration). As such, clinician participants were not ran-
domised into these long and short training subgroups.
The clinicians were given consent documentation, and
were made aware of their rights, including the right to
withdraw from the study at any stage. Those providing
consent also provided demographic data.
Procedure
Video analysis has been used in previous musculoskeletal
conditions to
investigate
the
reliability of
assessing
posture
and
movement,35–39
including
shoulder
research,40–42 and was determined to be the most appro-
priate method for the current investigation. The use of
videos ensured that a large number of assessors were
able to observe the patient’s response to the SSMP con-
currently from the same angle.
Video filming occurred in a clinical research room at
the University of Limerick, Ireland. Videos were made of
one of the investigators (JSL) conducting the SSMP on
the 11 patient participants. All videos were filmed on
the same day. The videos were filmed and audio record-
ings were made using two JVC Everio Camcorders
(Model
No.
GZ-MS210BEK)
cameras
(Yokohama,
Japan),
mounted
on
extendable
tripods
positioned
∼1.5 m from the patient participants. To standardise the
position, patients were instructed to stand on a cross
taped to the floor in front of the cameras. To reduce dis-
tortion, the cameras were positioned as close to perpen-
dicular to the patients as possible. Initially, the patient
participants were requested to identify and demonstrate
the
movement
that
reproduced
their
symptoms.
Following this, the SSMP assessment procedures were
performed and the patients’ responses filmed, and the
patients were asked whether the symptoms were the
same, worse or better. At the end of data collection, 167
unique video recordings were available for analysis. The
video recordings
were initially edited
using Adobe
Creative Cloud Premier Pro (http://www.abobe.com)
and then converted to .avi files using PRISM video con-
verter
software
(http://www.nchsoftware.com).
These
.avi files were played using Windows Media Player
(http://www.microsoft.com).
The
duration
of
each
audio and video clip ranged from 26 to 150 s, with most
being under 1 min. The video recordings were uploaded
onto
a secure server
located
at
the
University of
Limerick.
Clinician participants were provided with a unique log
in and password to the server and independently
watched the video clips and completed the data collec-
tion documentation. Each video was assigned a separate
table on the documentation sheet and after watching
each video, the clinician participants were required to
record if the SSMP technique had produced no change,
made the patient worse or resulted in either partial or
complete improvement. The clinicians were informed
that responses were to be informed by the responses
provided by the patients and not by their own interpreta-
tions. Owing to technical constraints, the order of the
video clips was not randomised and the clinician partici-
pants could choose to watch the video clips in any order.
They were encouraged to carry out the task in their own
time and in a quiet place without interruptions, and to
take breaks as necessary. Clinicians were instructed that
ideally they should only watch the video on one occasion
but were permitted to watch on two occasions if they
were unsure of the patient’s responses. Confirmation of
this type would occur in clinical practice in such cases of
uncertainty. Clinician participants were instructed that
they should record:
▸ ‘no-change’ if the patient reported that the technique
had not changed their symptoms,
▸ ‘worse’ if the patient reported that the technique had
increased their symptoms,
▸ ‘partial improvement’ if the patient reported that the
technique had partially improved their symptoms,
which was defined as anything between 1% and 99%
improvement, and
▸ ‘complete improvement’ if the patient reported that
the technique had completely alleviated their symp-
toms (ie, 100% improvement).
To reduce bias, clinicians’ scores were entered into a
database by a research assistant who was unaware of the
purpose of the investigation. Once the data sheet was
complete, the clinicians’ involvement in the study was
complete. At the end of the data collection period, to
protect patient confidentiality, the videos were removed
from the secure server and destroyed.
The focus of the analysis of the data was on inter-rater
reliability. No attempt was made to assess intrarater reli-
ability, for the following reasons:
1. intrarater reliability can be assumed to be at least as
good as inter-rater reliability, and as the primary prac-
tical concern is to assess the lower limit of reliability,
a separate assessment of intrarater reliability is of
little interest;
2. a repeated assessment of the same videotaped tech-
nique by the same clinician would have little rele-
vance to clinical practice;
3. given that the SSMP aims to improve symptoms, if the
technique had been videotaped twice, the technique
itself might have altered, such that a subsequent test of
the same procedure would not be testing the same

Description of techniques
Table 1 describes the techniques assessed in the current
investigation.
Table 1
Description of techniques
Technique
Description
Thoracic extension
The patient is asked to place a finger (typically from the asymptomatic upper limb) on the sternum and while still
maintaining contact with the sternum, gently ‘lift’ the finger superiorly, aiming to extend the thoracic kyphosis
Scapular elevation
The therapist gently places one hand over the lateral border of the scapular and elevates (ie, upwardly rotates)
the scapula ∼1–2 cm using the other hand on top of the shoulder girdle as a guide. This then becomes the new
‘starting position’ for shoulder movement. The scapula is free to move during arm movement but starts and
returns in the elevated position
Scapular depression
The opposite direction to scapular elevation
Scapular retraction
The therapist gently places one hand over the lateral border of the scapular and retracts the scapula ∼1–2 cm
using the other hand on top of the shoulder girdle as a guide. This then becomes the new ‘starting position’ for
shoulder movement. The scapula is free to move during arm movement but starts and returns to the new
retracted position
Scapular posterior tilt
The therapist gently places one hand over the lateral border of the scapular and the thumb over the inferior
angle of the scapula. The other hand on top of the shoulder girdle gently displaces the superior aspect of the
scapula (and other structures) posteriorly. This then becomes the new ‘starting position’ for shoulder movement.
The scapula is free to move during arm movement but starts and returns to the new posterior tilted position
Combinations
If a number of scapular positions are found to be partially reduce symptoms, they can be combined to
determine if further improvement if achieved (eg, elevation and posterior tilt; retraction, depression and posterior
tilt)
Depression—flexion
In sitting or standing, the patient’s shoulder is flexed as close to 90° flexion as possible (maybe in less or more
range, depending on symptoms), the elbow is flexed (ie, shortened lever arm). The therapist places his/her
hand on the posterior surface of the distal end of the humerus, 2–3 cm proximal to the point of the elbow. The
patient is then asked to push the elbow towards the ground with the therapist resisting isometrically for 5–6 s.
The contraction is repeated 3–4 times and the arm gently lowered to the side and the provocative movement
retested
Depression—abduction
The same as for depression—flexion but the starting position is with the shoulder in the plane of the scapula or
closer to anatomical abduction if appropriate
Depression—flexion
(supine)
This technique is the same as depression—flexion but is performed in supine and in addition to the muscle
contraction procedure, a series of inferiorly directed gliding pressures are applied to the region of the humeral
head. Following the technique, the provocative movement is retested
Depression—abduction
(supine)
The same as for depression—flexion (supine), but the starting position is with the shoulder in the plane of the
scapula or closer to anatomical abduction if appropriate
Eccentric flexion
In sitting or standing with the shoulder flexed just before the onset of symptoms, the hand loosely grips an
elastic rubber resistance tube, which is firmly suspended from above (ie, over the top of a door). With the arm in
the same position, tension is applied to the tube and then the hand firmly holds the tube. Following this, the
patient is instructed to extend the shoulder ∼20–30° hold isometrically for 5–6 s and then slowly return to the
starting position (ie, concentric, isometric and eccentric contractions). This is repeated 3–4 times, the tube
released and the provocative movement retested
Eccentric abduction
The same as for eccentric flexion but the starting position is with the shoulder in the plane of the scapula or
closer to anatomical abduction if appropriate
External rotation
If the provocative movement is shoulder flexion or abduction, the movements are performed with increased
shoulder external rotator activity. This could be achieved by using the resistance of an elastic rubber band, the
therapists hand or pushing against a wall using a towel, plastic bag or polishing cloth to reduce resistance
Internal rotation
The same as for external rotation with resistance aimed at increasing an internal rotation force. In addition to the
suggestions above, internal rotation resistance can be achieved by asking the patient to flex the shoulders while
applying pressure to a ball the size of a soccer or basketball
AP|AP with inclination
Using a mobilisation belt, heavy resistance elastic rubber band, or a neoprene strap placed over the region
corresponding to the anatomical location of the humeral head a posteriorly directed force is applied by the
therapist with the therapists other hand stabilising the scapula. While the pressure is applied, the provocative
movement is retested. This may be shoulder abduction-external rotation as may occur in someone with an
anteriorly unstable shoulder. Care needs to be taken. In addition to trialling different amounts of posteriorly
directed force, the therapist can apply a posteriorly directed force with a superior inclination to assess if this
combination more effectively reduces symptoms
PA|PA with inclination
The same as for AP|AP with inclination, but with the pressure applied to produce an anteriorly directed force
AP, anterior to posterior; PA, posterior to anterior.

 Statistical analysis
The inter-rater reliability of clinicians’ assessment of the
response to SSMP procedures was calculated by analys-
ing the responses provided by the clinicians (no change,
worse, partial improvement, complete improvement)
using Krippendorff’s α.46 This statistic is a reliability
coefficient suitable for analysing responses from mul-
tiple raters, and accommodates missing data. It ranges
from 0 to 1, with 1 representing perfect agreement, and
was calculated with the ratings defined as ordinal. A
95% CI for α and the probability of not attaining a coef-
ficient of at least 0.800 were obtained through bootstrap-
ping (10 000 samples). The 95% CI gives a range of
plausible values for the ‘true’ reliability, such that we can
be 95% confident that the true reliability is at least the
lower limit of the CI, while the probability value indi-
cates the probability of the ‘true’ reliability not attaining
a minimum threshold of 0.800. Reliability was only calcu-
lated where at least three patients were assessed with any
one procedure. The rate of missing values for each pro-
cedure was calculated as the number of times that a
rater did not provide a rating, out of the total number
of possible ratings (n of patients×n of raters). Analyses
were conducted in SPSS V.23.
Sample size
There do not appear to be formal methods of calculat-
ing sample size for reliability studies with ordinal out-
comes
and
multiple
raters.
However,
methods
for
continuous outcomes, such as those described by Walter
et al,47 may provide some guidance. For example, with
20 or more raters, 10 patients would provide at least
80% power to detect a coefficient of 0.800 as greater
than a null value of 0.500, at a 5% significance level.
RESULTS
Eleven patient participants consented to participate.
Each presented with unilateral shoulder pain and was
naïve to the SSMP procedure. The mean age was
53.7 years. Seven were men and six had symptoms involv-
ing the right shoulder. Patient participant demographic
information is detailed in table 2.
Of the 40 clinicians approached (as a sample of con-
venience) to participate in the investigation, 37 (92.5%)
provided responses. Of the three who did not respond,
two cited insufficient time as being the reason for not
completing the data sheets; the reason for the other
clinician is unknown. There were 20 female and 17 male
clinician participants (36 physiotherapists and 1 osteo-
path). Eighteen had participated in a short (∼3 hours)
training programme to explain and practice the SSMP
.
Nineteen had participated in a longer training pro-
gramme (∼1 day). Clinician participant demographic
information is detailed in table 3.
Response to the SSMP
In total, 19 procedures and combinations were tested,
representing isolated procedures (eg, scapular elevation)
and, when indicated, procedures tested in combination
(eg, thoracic extension and scapular posterior tilt). The
responses to the procedures are detailed in table 4.
Responses to each of these procedures were assessed by

reported a worsening of symptoms and no change was
reported 29 (21.6%) times. On 91 occasions (67.9%),
participants reported a partial or complete reduction in
symptoms. The intertester reliability of the clinicians’
ratings is presented in table 5.
Nineteen clinicians had participated in longer training
(over 1 day) and 18 clinicians over a shorter period
(∼3 hours). The α coefficients for these two subgroups
are presented in table 6. The mean difference in esti-
mates of these coefficients (long training subgroup
minus short training subgroup) was calculated as −0.001
(95% CI −0.052 to 0.0510). Figure 2 indicates the extent
of the discrepancy in the reliability of assessments
between clinicians in these subgroups. The ends of each
horizontal bar indicate the value of α for each subgroup,
such that the length of the bar indicates the magnitude
of difference between these values.
DISCUSSION
Deriving a definitive structural diagnosis for an individ-
ual presenting with shoulder pain is fraught with diffi-
culty. Suggesting care pathways based on the responses
to orthopaedic tests and imaging may not correctly rep-
resent the mechanisms underlying the presenting symp-
toms.

 structural changes and symptoms and poor accuracy of
the clinical orthopaedic tests themselves. Clinical diag-
nosis is further challenged by the need to appreciate,
for those presenting with pain as the main symptom,
whether the symptoms have a peripheral nociceptive
driver or occur as the result of altered central pain pro-
cessing.48 Owing to these complexities, for many, clinical
practice is currently based on assessing the response to
techniques that do not require a structural diagnosis
and using the responses of the assessment procedures to
inform management.24 49 The SSMP falls within this cat-
egory of clinical assessment. The findings of the current
investigation suggest that clinicians are able to assess the
patient’s individual responses to the components of the
SSMP with a good degree of reliability; the lowest point
estimate of α was 0.762, for internal rotation in flexion,
which is close to the threshold value for ‘substantial’ reli-
ability of ≥0.810 proposed by Shrout.50 The estimates
were generally similar for those clinicians who had
undertaken longer training (1 day) and those who had
undertaken shorter training (3 hours); the largest dis-
crepancy was for internal rotation in flexion. Moreover,
there was no consistent pattern in these differences; reli-
ability was higher in the short training subgroup for
nine techniques and was higher in the long training sub-
group for eight techniques.
Although the number of raters was constant, the
number of patients in whom the reliability of the assess-
ment of each technique could be assessed varied from 3
to 11, and the precision of the estimates of α (as repre-
sented by the width of the associated 95% CI) varied
accordingly. Nonetheless, owing to the large number of
raters and the low rate of missing values, a reasonable
degree of precision was obtained even for estimates
based on just three patients.
In this investigation, reliability was assessed using video
analysis playback. This was chosen as pilot work prior to
this research clearly demonstrated that the response to a
technique could substantially change the ‘baseline’ for
the second tester and therefore confound the possibility
of determining the reliability of assessment. The use of
videotapes ensured that all clinicians were assessing the
same response. Before the SSMP should be considered
to be a reliable clinical assessment procedure, the find-
ings of this investigation need to be repeated in a larger
sample of patients, as well as testing other methods of
reliability such as direct observation of patients being
assessed clinically.
Our findings suggest that clinicians can learn the com-
ponent techniques of the SSMP and reliably determine
if they have influenced the patient’s symptoms in a rela-
tively short period of time, and there do not appear to
be substantial clinical differences in reliability if training
is conducted over a 3 hour period or over the course of
1 day. However, it should be remembered that clinicians
were not randomly allocated to the two durations of
training, and a conclusive comparison of the two sub-
groups cannot therefore be made. It is important to

 ‘real-time’ improvement in symptoms associated with
changes to scapular posture during active shoulder ele-
vation10 51 was the most consistent positive biomechan-
ical prognostic factor identified at 6 months.52 An
improvement in symptoms and/or range of shoulder
elevation was demonstrated during manual facilitation
of the scapula in 41% (n=426) of participants and
near-complete or complete reduction in pain and/or
restoration of shoulder elevation in 12% (n=122) of
participants.52
One of the potential benefits of assessment and man-
agement systems such as the SSMP is that demonstrating
to a patient that symptoms are modifiable may give the
individual confidence to move, due to the reduction or
cessation of symptoms, which, in turn, may facilitate
adherence to treatment.53 Poor adherence has been
shown to compromise the effectiveness of treatment,53 54
and as self-management is required in most chronic con-
ditions, finding a technique that reduces or alleviates
symptoms may encourage the patient and facilitate the
management process. Therapy-related factors are one of
the five dimensions influencing adherence to treat-
ment.54 Although there are many subcategories within
this dimension, the immediacy of beneficial effect is
cited as a factor influencing adherence (p. 30). From
the patient’s perspective, the perception that treatment
is effective in ameliorating unpleasant symptoms is a pre-
condition
for
continued
compliance
(adherence).55
Although there is no empirical evidence to support this
contention, procedures such as the SSMP
, which may
demonstrate immediate improvement in symptoms, may
support adherence to an agreed management plan. Of
relevance, people with chronic low back pain preferred
exercises that were individualised and made sense, and
felt their individualised needs were addressed; they were
less likely to engage with exercises that were boring or
lacked challenge.56 Appropriate and balanced communi-
cation with patients is vital to frame the entirety of the
management plan.
When asked if they attribute the cause of presenting
symptoms to anything specific, people presenting with
shoulder symptoms commonly implicate ‘poor posture’.
Although deviations in posture (from an idealised
norm) are frequently cited as the cause of shoulder pain
and symptoms,57 58 this relationship has been repeatedly
challenged,59–62 and this in turn calls into question the
extent to which clinical reasoning should be based on
static observation of posture. Components of the SSMP
involve changing posture during symptomatic activities.
If symptoms consistently change, then these changes
can be incorporated into the management plan. Also of
relevance is that for an individual who is convinced, or
who has been convinced, that posture is a key factor
underlying the presenting symptoms, demonstrating no
change or a worsening in symptoms when changing
posture may alter this perception and this may thereby
facilitate the acceptance of alternative management
strategies.
Of importance, the SSMP is not a stand-alone proced-
ure and must be embedded within a complete patient
care management programme that includes education,
support, advice, consideration of lifestyle and psycho-
social factors, general fitness and other local manage-
ment strategies. If SSMP techniques do not positively
influence symptoms, other treatments or interventions
may need to be considered. These may include (but are
not restricted to) graduated shoulder exercises aimed at
the rotator cuff and shoulder muscles.11 63–66

 Limitations
The findings of this investigation need to be interpreted in
the light of certain limitations. Foremost of these is that the
clinicians only viewed one physiotherapist performing the
SSMP in video format. If the clinician participants had
observed other clinicians performing the SSMP procedures,
different estimates of reliability might have resulted. The
use of videos was necessary owing to the large number of
assessors and the need for them to observe the same
responses to each technique; however, although not practic-
able in this study, it would be more clinically realistic to dir-
ectly observe the clinician and the patient’s responses.
The use of a larger sample of patients would have
allowed the reliability of the SSMP to be evaluated over a
wider range of clinical presentation. There was, however,
a
relatively
large
clinician
sample,
which
provided
precise estimates of the reliability coefficients. It also
allowed the relative influence of short-duration and
long-duration training on reliability to be determined,
though this was not a randomised comparison and is
subject to confounding by other factors. In addition, it is
important to emphasise that the findings only relate to
the reliability of clinicians’ interpretation of the SSMP pro-
cedures; the consistency with which such procedures are
applied is a separate issue. Finally, being a university
laboratory, the environment where the procedures were
conducted and filmed was a controlled environment
that may not reflect the realities of clinical practice.
Future research
The purpose of this research was to investigate the inter-
tester reliability of the SSMP
. Suggestions to assess the
influence of symptom modification in a systematic way
have been made23 24 49 and the responses used to guide
treatment. There is a pressing need to understand the
relevance (if any) of these types of approaches in their
ability to support patient management, not only in
terms of clinical outcome (type of change, magnitude of
change, duration of change), but also in terms of the
mechanism(s), by which they may produce a change.
There is need to determine if SSMP procedures, embed-
ded within a framework of care (advice, education, grad-
uated exercise), add any additional value to overall
management. If they have contributed positively, their
continued use should be considered and if not, concepts
such as this should be abandoned. There would be
benefit in qualitative research to better understand
patients’ perceptions of SSMP procedures.
CONCLUSIONS
Deriving a definitive structural diagnosis for a person
presenting with a musculoskeletal condition involving
the shoulder is difficult. Limitations have been recog-
nised for imaging as well as for orthopaedic special tests.
One solution is partially to base management on the
response to tests aimed at reducing the severity of the
patient’s
perception
of
symptoms.
One
(of
many)
methods
is
the
Shoulder
Symptom
Modification
Procedure. The findings of the present study suggest
that the procedure demonstrates a good level of reliabil-
ity. More research is needed to better understand the
relevance and importance of such procedures.
