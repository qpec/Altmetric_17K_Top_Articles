Abstract
Context: To date, there is no Level 1 evidence comparing the efficacy of radical
prostatectomy and radiotherapy for patients with clinically-localized prostate cancer.
Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis assessing the overall and prostate cancer-specific
mortality among patients treated with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for
clinically-localized prostate cancer.
Evidence acquisition: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library through
June 2015 without year or language restriction, supplemented with hand search, using
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and Meta-analysis
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We used multivariable adjusted
hazard ratios (aHRs) to assess each endpoint. Risk of bias was assessed using the
Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
Evidence synthesis: Nineteen studies of low to moderate risk of bias were selected and
up to 118 830 patients were pooled. Inclusion criteria and follow-up length varied
between studies. Most studies assessed patients treated with external beam radiother-
apy, although some included those treated with brachytherapy separately or with the
external beam radiation therapy group. The risk of overall (10 studies, aHR 1.63, 95%
confidence interval 1.54–1.73, p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%) and prostate cancer-specific
(15 studies, aHR 2.08, 95% confidence interval 1.76–2.47, p < 0.00001; I2 = 48%)
mortality were higher for patients treated with radiotherapy compared with those
treated with surgery. Subgroup analyses by risk group, radiation regimen, time period,
and follow-up length did not alter the direction of results.
Conclusions: Radiotherapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of
overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality compared with surgery based on obser-
vational data with low to moderate risk of bias. These data, combined with the
forthcoming randomized data, may aid clinical decision making.
Patient summary: We reviewed available studies assessing mortality after prostate
cancer treatment with surgery or radiotherapy. While the studies used have a potential
for bias due to their observational design, we demonstrated consistently higher mor-
tality for patients treated with radiotherapy rather than surgery.

 1. 
Introduction
Nonconservative treatment options for patients diagnosed
with clinically-localized prostate cancer include radical
prostatectomy and radiotherapy [1]. Currently, there are no
published randomized controlled trials comparing their
efficacy. For patients desiring nonconservative treatment,
established clinical guidelines recommend either treatment
option and patients must ultimately decide for themselves
which treatment to undertake [2,3].
Few reviews and meta-analyses have been published on
this subject. Recent reviews have focused on patients with
high-risk prostate cancer [4,5]. These have reported a benefit
of radical prostatectomy over radiotherapy for both overall
and prostate cancer specific mortality [4,5]. The limited scope
of previous reviews and recent publication of a number of
studies assessing prostate cancer-specific and overall surviv-
al for patients treated with contemporary forms of radio-
therapy [6–8] requires a new, comprehensive meta-analysis.
Our objective was to systematically review and conduct
a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare efficacy
data on overall and prostate cancer-specific survival among
patients treated with radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy
for clinically-localized prostate cancer.
2. 
Evidence acquisition
2.1. 
Research question
Do patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinical-
ly-localized prostate cancer have improved overall or
prostate cancer-specific mortality compared with those
treated with radiotherapy?
2.2. 
Types of studies
We included randomized controlled trials, cohort, and case-
control studies. Case series lacking comparator groups were
excluded. Other publications including editorials, commen-
taries, and review articles were excluded. Publications not
subject to peer-review (ie, reports of data from vital statistics
and dissertations or theses) were also excluded. Where there
was more than one publication resulting from the same
patient cohort, to prevent the duplication of patients from
one cohort, for each of our analyses we selected one study
based on a hierarchical assessment of comparability of study
groups, time period of study (preference for more recent),
and number of patients (Supplementary data).
2.3. 
Types of participants and exposure
We reviewed studies reporting on men of any age with
nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with any commonly-
utilized form of radiotherapy including conformal external
beam (EBRT), intensity-modulated (IMRT), brachytherapy,
or a combination of radiotherapy modalities with curative
treatment intent. We excluded studies assessing adjuvant
or salvage therapies as the specific objective. We included
studies irrespective of dose and duration of radiotherapy. In
order to be included, studies had to have a comparison
group comprising patients treated with radical prostatec-
tomy. Studies assessing nonstandard treatments (such as
cryotherapy) were excluded.
2.4. 
Outcome measures
The primary outcome was overall mortality and the
secondary outcome was prostate cancer-specific mortality.
Studies reporting surrogate endpoints such as biochemical
recurrence only were excluded. Since age, comorbidity, and
histologic factors such as grade and stage significantly
impact overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality [8,9],
we considered studies only reporting multivariable adjust-
ed hazard ratios (aHR). We excluded crude or unadjusted
outcome measures since these would provide biased
estimates given the known differences in age and comor-
bidity between patients treated with radiotherapy and
surgery.
2.5. 
Methods of review
We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses and Meta-analysis of Observational
studies in Epidemiology guidelines for reporting of this
systematic review and meta-analysis [10,11].
2.6. 
Search strategy
Medline, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched using
the OvidSP search platform for studies indexed from
database inception to June 1, 2015 with the assistance of a
professional librarian. We used both subject headings and
text-word terms for ‘‘radical prostatectomy’’, ‘‘prostate
cancer surgery’’, ‘‘radiotherapy’’, ‘‘outcome’’, ‘‘survival/mor-
tality’’, and related and exploded terms including medical
subject headings terms in combination with keyword
searching. A full search strategy is presented in the
Supplementary data. No limitations were placed with respect
to publication language or publication year. Following the
literature search, all duplicates were excluded. References
from review articles, commentaries, editorials, included
studies, and conference publications of relevant medical
societies were reviewed and cross-referenced to ensure
completeness. Conference abstracts were excluded.
2.7. 
Review methods
Two authors performed the study selection independently
(C.J.D.W. 
and 
R.S.). 
Disagreements 
were 
resolved 
by
consensus with the senior author (R.K.N.). Titles and
abstracts were used to screen for initial study inclusion.
Full-text review was used where abstracts were insufficient
to determine if the study met inclusion or exclusion criteria.
The final list of selected studies was agreed upon by
urologists (C.J.D.W. and R.K.N.), radiation oncologists (R.C.
and C.D.), and an epidemiologist (R.S.). One author (C.J.D.W.)
performed all data abstraction including evaluation of study

 characteristics, risk of bias, and outcome measures with
independent verification performed by other authors.
2.8. 
Risk of bias assessment
We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for risk of bias
assessment. This scale assesses risk of bias in three domains
[12]: (1) selection of the study groups; (2) comparability of
groups; and (3) ascertainment of exposure and outcome
[13]. Studies with scores � 7 were considered as having a
low risk of bias, scores of 4–6 as having a moderate risk of
bias, and scores < 4 as having a high risk of bias. We
assessed that follow-up was adequate if the median or
mean follow-up was in excess of 5 yr.
2.9. 
Measures of treatment effect
We assessed the aHR for mortality for patients treated with
radiotherapy and surgery.
2.10. 
Assessment of heterogeneity
We identified heterogeneity using the Q test, estimated it
using the DerSimonian-Laird method, and quantified it
using I2 values [14]. Furthermore, we employed random-
effects models for each of our analyses given the identified
clinical heterogeneity.
2.11. 
Assessment of reporting bias
We assessed publication bias for outcomes with more than
10 included studies using funnel plots.
2.12. 
Data synthesis
Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3
(Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane
Collaboration, 2014) software. We used the inverse variance
technique for meta-analysis of hazard ratios. Due to the
clinical heterogeneity inherent in our data, random-effects
models were used for all meta-analyses.
2.13. 
Subgroup analysis
We performed a number of a priori subgroup analyses. We
planned subgroup 
analyses 
restricted 
to 
EBRT, IMRT,
brachytherapy, and brachytherapy with EBRT boost. How-
ever, data were only available for subgroup analyses of EBRT,
IMRT, and brachytherapy. We also performed subgroup
analysis assessing the impact of: (1) prostate cancer risk stage
(low, intermediate, and high); (2) duration of follow-up (<5
yr, 5–8 yr, >8 yr); (3) study era (‘‘old’’ if the accrual started
prior to 1990 or ended prior to 2005 and ‘‘newer’’ otherwise);
and (4) study location (USA and rest of the world).
We 
did 
not 
encounter 
any 
issues 
with 
repeated
measures, unit of analyses, or missing data.
3. 
Evidence synthesis
Our literature search identified 1624 unique references
(Fig. 1). After full text review of 73 manuscripts, 19 were
selected for inclusion. The reasons for exclusion are
provided in Figure 1 and the Supplementary data. In
particular, there were multiple publications arising from
Fig. 1 – Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram outlining search strategy and final included and excluded studies.

 the same clinical cohorts over the same time period. To
prevent the duplication of patients, a single study was
chosen to represent each cohort for each comparison as
outlined in the Supplementary data.
3.1. 
Study description
Three studies were from single centers, five were from
multiple institutions, and the remaining 11 were from
administrative databases (Table 1). The inclusion criteria
and length of follow-up varied significantly between
included studies (Table 1). Some studies imposed minimum
age requirements while others imposed maximum age
requirements which resulted in significant differences in
age distribution between studies. Patients treated with
radiotherapy were generally older in all of the included
studies.
Most studies assessed the efficacy of EBRT with some
including patients treated with brachytherapy. Two studies
provided data restricted to patients treated with IMRT. The
dosage of radiation was only available for eight of 19 (42%)
studies. 
Brachytherapy 
dosage 
was 
in 
keeping 
with
standard recommended doses, while only two studies
provided ‘‘dose-escalated’’ EBRT treatments to all patients
[7,15]. There was considerable variability in the use of
adjuvant or salvage therapies. In some studies, patients
receiving these treatments were excluded while in others
all patients received adjuvant therapies.
Study inclusion criteria, including patient age and
disease characteristics, significantly affected mortality rates
for both all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality
(Table 2). Overall mortality rates significantly exceeded
prostate cancer-specific mortality, particular in patients
with low-risk disease. Covariates included in the adjusted
models varied significantly between studies though typi-
cally included age, clinical stage, Gleason score, and
Charlson comorbidity (Supplementary Table 1).
3.2. 
Risk of bias assessment
The majority of included studies were felt to have low to
moderate risk of bias (Table 3). Some studies used

Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Eur Urol (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2015.11.010
 Patients treated with radiotherapy experienced an increased
risk of overall mortality compared with those treated with
radical prostatectomy (aHR 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.54–1.73, p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%; Fig. 2a). Where authors
provided outcome data for patients treated with radiothera-
py alone and radiotherapy with androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT), we used the aggregate results for both groups.
We found a similar direction of effect when we examined
patients with low risk prostate cancer (aHR 1.47, 95% CI
1.19–1.83, p = 0.0004, I2 = 59%), intermediate risk prostate
cancer (aHR1.50, 95% CI 1.24–1.82, p < 0.0001; I2 = N/A), or
high risk prostate cancer (aHR 1.88, 95% CI 1.64–2.16,
p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%).
Further subgroup analyses did not differ in direction from
the primary results (Table 4). Patients treated with radio-
therapy who were treated in the earlier era (study accrual
period prior to 2005) had similar outcomes to those treated in
the newer era (p = 0.14; Table 4). While assessing by
radiotherapy modality, we found a similar risk for patients
treated with EBRT (conformal radiation therapy [CRT] or
IMRT) and with brachytherapy (Table 4). No studies were
identified that reported on the risk of overall survival while
comparing IMRT to surgery. There were no ‘‘between group’’
differences observed with respect to duration of follow-up
(p = 0.24; I2 = 30%; Table 4). One study did not report follow-
up duration. Similarly, there were no differences between the
treatment eras (p = 0.14; I2 = 53%). Finally, there was no
difference observed whether the study cohort was from the
USA or the rest of the world (p = 0.52; I2 = 0%; Table 4).
3.4. 
Prostate cancer-specific mortality
Fifteen 
studies 
reporting 
on 
118 
830 
patients 
were
aggregated to assess the effect of treatment modality on
prostate cancer specific mortality. Patients treated with
radiotherapy had an increased risk of prostate cancer-
specific mortality (aHR 2.08, 95% CI 1.76–2.47, p < 0.00001;
I2 = 48%; Fig. 2b) compared with those treated with surgery.
We found similar results when we examined only
patients with low risk prostate cancer (aHR 1.70, 95% CI
1.36–2.13, p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%), intermediate risk prostate
cancer (aHR1.80, 95% CI 1.45–2.25, p < 0.0001; I2 = 0%), or
high risk prostate cancer (aHR 1.83, 95% CI 1.51–2.22,
p = 0.0001; I2 = 42%).
Subanalyses for this endpoint also had similar direction
of results to the primary analysis. We observed no between-
subgroup differences when examining the effect of study
era (p = 0.85; I2 = 0%; Table 4). Assessing the effect of
specific radiotherapy modalities, we found an increased risk
for those treated with EBRT (CRT or IMRT), IMRT alone, and
brachytherapy alone (Table 4). There were no ‘‘between-
group’’ differences observed with respect to duration of
follow-up (p = 0.47; I2 = 0%), although the magnitude of
effect 
increased 
with 
increasing 
length 
of 
follow-up
(Table 4). Two studies did not report follow-up duration.
Similarly, results were consistent regardless of geographic
location of publication (p = 0.26; I2 = 22%; Table 4).
3.5. 
Publication bias
We assessed publication bias using funnel plots comparing
effect size and measure of precision of the effect size for the
main analysis of our primary and secondary analyses
(Supplementary Fig. 1). We did not identify any evidence of
publication bias.

Discussion
In this review and meta-analysis of 19 studies with low to
moderate risk of bias, we identified an increased overall and
prostate cancer-specific mortality for patients treated with
radiotherapy compared with those treated with surgery for

 clinically localized prostate cancer. These findings were
supported with subgroup analyses which assessed the
impact of prostate cancer risk category, radiotherapy
modality, duration of follow-up, era of study accrual, and
geographic region.
To our knowledge, this represents the most comprehen-
sive and up-to-date review on this topic. Petrelli et al [5]
conducted a meta-analysis examining the survival out-
comes among patients with only high risk prostate cancer
treated with surgery or radiotherapy [5]. They found better
overall and prostate cancer-specific survival for patients
treated with surgery compared with radiotherapy. A key
limitation of this study was that they used adjusted and
unadjusted odds ratios which do not take into account the
time-to-event outcome measures as our study has done
[16]. 
Other 
recent 
reviews 
have 
been 
restricted 
to
randomized controlled trials [17], to high-risk patients
[4], or did not provide aggregate risk estimates [18].
Two small randomized controlled trials have compared
survival outcomes for patients treated with surgery or
radiotherapy for prostate cancer [19,20]. These were largely
underpowered and have not been used to guide treatment
decision making. Other trials have closed prematurely due
to poor accrual [21] because of patients’ unwillingness to
leave their treatment to chance [22].
We performed a number of prespecified subgroup
analyses to explore potential areas of bias, but analyses
stratified by prostate cancer risk category, radiotherapy
modality, duration of follow-up, era of study accrual, and
geographic region did not differ from the overall analysis.
Recently, radiation dose escalation was associated with
improved overall survival in patients with intermediate-
and high-risk prostate cancer compared with standard
dosing [23]. While we were not able to ascertain specific
radiation doses from many studies, the majority of included
patients 
were 
treated 
with 
standard-dose 
regimens.
Zelefsky et al [15] used dose-escalated IMRT (>81 Gy)
and found results similar to the other included studies.
We found statistically significant between-study het-
erogeneity for our pooled analysis of prostate cancer-
specific mortality, but not overall mortality. This is likely
due to increased uncertainty and methodologic differences
in assigning cause of death. Some studies used administra-
tive death records. Other studies used outcome determina-
tion at the discretion of the treating physician [15,24], and
yet others used a combination of death certificates and
physician correspondence [25,9].
Major strengths of this review include a comprehensive
search strategy, careful selection of studies, critical and
thorough quality appraisal of included studies, a priori
subgroup analyses, and the use an outcome measure which
incorporates the time-to-event nature of the data and
adjusts for known confounders. A meta-analysis depends on
the validity of the included studies to draw accurate
conclusions. Therefore, a key limitation of our study is the
effect of residual confounding as this analysis is based on
observational data. It is well established that patients
treated with radiotherapy tend to be older and have a higher
level of comorbidity. As the vast majority of the included
studies measured comorbidity using the Charlson comor-
bidity index, there remains the potential for heterogeneity
within the categories resulting in residual confounding.
Giordano et al [26] postulate that this may be driven by
unmeasured differences in functional status and self-
reported health. While current statistical methodologies
such as regression and matching are unable to fully adjust for
selection bias and unmeasured confounders [26], we only
used multivariable aHRs in our study in an attempt to provide
more accurate risk estimates. Also, the use of salvage
therapies may explain some of the survival differences
between the groups. Patients initially treated with surgery
may undergo salvage radiotherapy while patients who fail
after radiotherapy are less often offered salvage surgery. In
contrast, patients with recurrence following radiotherapy are
typically managed with ADT. In the included studies, the use
of adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy varied—many did not
specify the use of this therapy, some excluded these patients,
and usage ranged from 3–10% in the remainder. Additionally,
the use of ADT, either as adjuvant or salvage therapy, varied
widely as expected given the heterogeneity of prostate
cancer disease characteristics included. ADT usage was
higher in patients treated with radiotherapy in the vast
majority of studies. This is in keeping with expectations as
the use of neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant ADT is often
part of standard care in the radiotherapy setting, as its benefit
has been shown in several large randomized radiotherapy
studies. Also, for overall survival, there were insufficient data
to assess the efficacy of IMRT, which has largely supplanted
three-dimensional CRT in many jurisdictions [27]. Finally, a
pathological review is rarely undertaken in large databases.
As a result, heterogeneity may exist within pathological
grading in these data sources due to interobserver variability.
Implications for future research assessing the compara-
tive efficacy of surgery and radiotherapy in prostate cancer
will largely depend on the results of the upcoming
randomized ProtecT trial [28]. Clinical implications will
likely depend on the congruence of the observational and
randomized data. Prospective data derived from random-
ized controlled trials will allow for better management of
confounding in addition to allowing for longitudinal
quality-of-life assessment which is unavailable from large
administrative datasets. As is emphasized in current clinical
guidelines, both treatment modalities should be discussed
with eligible patients prior to initiation of either therapy
[1]. Given that current clinical guidelines do not discrimi-
nate patients by age and comorbidity level, the results of
this study would be an important consideration for patients
and physicians.
5. 
Conclusions
We identified an increased risk of overall and prostate
cancer-specific mortality for patients treated with radio-
therapy compared with surgery after adjustment for
common patient and tumor prognostic factors. Methodo-
logic limitations of the observational studies included
should be considered while interpreting these results.
