Abstract Many species use social networks to buffer the effects of stress. The mere absence of
a social network, however, may also be stressful. We examined neuroendocrine, PVN CRH neurons
and report that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of these cells in sexually dimorphic
fashion. Specifically, isolating preadolescent female mice from littermates for <24 hr increased first
spike latency (FSL) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons. These changes were not evident in
age-matched males. By contrast, subjecting either males (isolated or grouped) or group housed
females to acute physical stress (swim), increased FSL. The increase in FSL following either social
isolation or acute physical stress was blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone
and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. The increase in FSL results in a decrease in the
excitability of CRH neurons. Our observations demonstrate that social isolation, but not acute
physical stress has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons.

Introduction
Survival threats trigger a repertoire of behavioral and endocrine adjustments (Cannon, 1932). The
endocrine changes rely on the immediate engagement of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)
axis which is controlled by corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Although it is essential for survival, the dysregulation of the
stress response is implicated in the emergence of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases (Tost et al.,
2015). Interestingly, many of these psychopathologies show sex-specific differences which may be a
consequence of sexual dimorphism of the neuroendocrine response to stress (Bale and Epperson,
2015). This sexual dimorphism may result in different response sensitivity to the same stressor and/
or differences in which stimuli males and females perceive as stressful. Human studies demonstrating
that young girls exhibit greater corticosteroid (CORT) stress reactivity to social stress tests than
boys (Gunnar et al., 2009; de Veld et al., 2012) suggest, for example, that young females are more
responsive to changes in social situations. Consistent with this idea, are demonstrations that, in com-
parison to males, females take greater advantage of social support and group dynamics to manage
stress (Taylor et al., 2000). Here we hypothesized that disrupting the social network would elicit
neurobiological changes preferentially in female mice.
Results
To test this idea, mice were housed in same-sex groups (3–5 animals per group) from weaning (p21)
until the day of the experiment (p22–35). This developmental window allows us to interrogate the
contributions
of
sex
differences

of

hormones (Nelson et al., 1990). Mice were either in same-sex groups, pairs, or isolated from litter-
mates for sixteen to eighteen hours. We then prepared hypothalamic brain slices and examined

slices (Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013b) (Figure 1a). Activation of these cells is obligatory for
launching the neuroendocrine response to stress (Denver, 2009).
The cellular heterogeneity in the PVN has necessitated various approaches to distinguish cell
types. One of the most widely used has been to identify cells based on their voltage responses to a
protocol of current steps. This reveals an ‘electrical fingerprint’ that has been used to distinguish
among magnocellular (oxytocin, vasopressin) (Tasker and Dudek, 1991) and parvocellular (CRH,
TRH, somatostatin) neurosecretory cells (Hoffman et al., 1991) and pre-autonomic neurons. Reports
of changes in the intrinsic properties of neurons following experimental manipulations ex
vivo (Shah et al., 2010; O’Leary et al., 2014; Kourrich et al., 2015), however, raise the possibility
that electrical fingerprints are dynamic and potentially unreliable as a classification tool. We have
recently described a transgenic reporter mouse in which CRH neurons can be identified and tar-
geted directly for electrophysiological recording (Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013b). In male mice,
the electrical fingerprint of CRH cells was consistent with previous reports on parvocellular neurose-
cretory cells (Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013b). These cells had a linear current voltage relation-
ship and, unlike the magnocellular neurosecretory cells, did not have a long delay to first spike (first
spike latency (FSL)) when depolarized from hyperpolarizing membrane potentials.
We first examined FSL of CRH neurons from group-housed vs isolated mice. FSL can play a key
role in integrating synaptic events and influence probability of firing (Molineux et al., 2005) and
changes in the underlying currents can tune neuronal frequency (Ellis et al., 2007). Social isolation
had no effect on FSL in males (malegroup: 48.7 ± 2.1 ms, n = 53 vs malesingle: 46.1 ± 1.8 ms, n = 76,
p=0.9; Figure 1b,c). By contrast, FSL in isolated females was significantly longer than FSL in group-
housed females (femalegroup: 45.1 ± 1.9 ms, n = 42; femalesingle: 65.6 ± 1.9, n = 177,
p<0.0001; Figure 1b,d). We then conducted experiments in which female mice were housed in pairs
prior to electrophysiology experiments. This manipulation revealed an intermediate phenotype, with
pair-housed females exhibiting FSLs that were longer than those observed in group housed female
mice, but shorter than those observed in single-housed female mice (femalepaired: 56.5 ± 2.0 ms, n =
105, p=0.0029 vs femalesingle and p=0.0017 vs femalegroup, F4,471 = 10.6). There was no difference in
the input resistance of isolated males vs isolated females (malesingle: 796 ± 31 MW, n = 157, vs fema-
lesingle: 869 ± 23 MW, n = 273; unpaired t-test, p=0.063; Figure 1—figure supplement 1) or spike
eLife digest Many species, including humans, use social interaction to reduce the effects of
stress. In fact, the lack of a social network may itself be a source of stress. Recent research suggests
that young girls are more sensitive to social stress than boys. This could mean that social networks
are more important for females in general, and that young females from different species, such as
mice, may be more sensitive to social isolation than males. However, few studies have examined
how social isolation affects the brain cells that control the release of stress hormones.As such, it
remains unknown whether isolating individuals from their social group impacts on the brain in sex-
specific ways.
Senst, Baimoukhametova et al. now show that the brains of young male and female mice react
differently to social isolation. Less than a day after separation from their littermates, the activity in
the brain cells of female mice became markedly different from that of isolated males. In contrast to
social isolation, the physical stress of being made to swim produced similar changes in the brains of
both male and female mice. Further experiments then showed that the changes in the brain cells
that control the release of stress hormones required a signalling chemical called corticosterone,
which is produced in response to stressful situations. This suggests that, in repsonse to soical
isolation, the females are experiencing more stress than the males.
Following on from this work, one future challenge will be to investigate if reuniting a social group
erases the effects of social isolation on the brain. Further experiments could also examine the
behavioural and physiological effects of social isolation, including how females respond to later
stressful events.

p=0.86; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We also examined properties of glutamate and GABA
synapses on CRH neurons in hypothalamic slices from single-housed females and males. We
observed no differences in basal glutamate (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) or GABA (Figure 1—
figure supplement 3) synaptic transmission. These observations indicate that social isolation alters
the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in female, but not age-matched male mice.
Next, we hypothesized that female mice, but not male mice, may interpret social isolation as a
stress. If true, we reasoned that subjecting single-housed male mice to an acute swim stress should
also increase FSL. In females, however, the prior isolation should occlude the effects of an acute
stress. To test this idea, single -housed male and female mice were subjected to swim stress for 20

 min and intrinsic properties of CRH neurons were assessed (Figure 2a). Following swim stress, FSL in
male mice (maleswim) was 64.0 ± 4.6 ms, n = 37, Figure 2b,c; this is significantly longer than FSL in
the single males reported above (maleswim vs malesingle, 1 way ANOVA, p=0.0004). FSL in single
female mice subjected to swim stress was 65.8 ± 4.9 ms, n = 32, Figure 2b,c; this is not different
from FSL in female mice subjected to social isolation (femaleswim vs femalesingle, p=0.67). Finally, FSL
in single males subjected to swim was not different from FSL in single females subjected to swim
(p=0.9, Figure 2b,c). This suggests that either increases in FSL following social isolation occlude fur-
ther effects of stress on CRH neurons or that females do not respond to swim stress. To test the
effects of swim stress independent of any potential effects of social isolation, we conducted experi-
ments in which group-housed females and males were subjected to swim stress. Following swim,
FSL in group-housed males (malegroup swim: 58.8 ± 2.8 ms, n = 23, Figure 2d) was significantly longer
than FSL in naı
¨ve, group -housed males (p<0.001). FSL of group-housed males subjected to swim
was not different than FSL in females subjected to swim (femalegroup swim:58.7 ± 1.9 ms, n = 27,
p>0.05 vs malegroup, Figure 2d). Similarly, CRH neurons in group-housed females subjected to swim
had a significantly longer FSL than CRH neurons in naive, group-housed females (p=0.0001). These
observations demonstrate that both females and males show equivalent sensitivity to an acute physi-
cal stress (i.e. forced swim). Additionally, a prior social isolation occludes the effects of subsequent
physical stress on FSL in females, but has no effect on FSL in males.
Since stress increases CORT, we examined the relationship between circulating CORT and FSL. In
order to assess CORT during a defined temporal window, we subjected single male mice to swim
stress and obtained samples thirty minutes after the protocol. We noted a positive correlation
between plasma CORT and FSL (r2 = 0.3, p=0.024, n = 17, Figure 3a). CORT, however, is one of
many signaling molecules that is altered in response to stress. To determine whether CORT is neces-
sary for increases in FSL following social isolation, we conducted experiments in which female mice
were given access to drinking water containing the CORT-synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone prior to,
and during, isolation (Figure 3b). Metyrapone treatment blocked the effects of social isolation on
FSL in female mice (femalesingle
metyrapone = 47.2 ± 2.0 ms, n = 24, p=0.001 vs femalesingle,

 Figure 3c). Next, to determine whether CORT is necessary for increases in FSL following swim stress,
we administered metyrapone prior to swim stress in single males (Figure 3d). This eliminated the
stress-induced increase in FSL in males (malemetyrapone = 50.2 ± 2.4 ms, n = 35, vs malevehicle = 66.7 ±
2.4, n = 23, p=0.007, Figure 3e). These observations demonstrate that CORT is necessary for stress-
induced changes in FSL in both males and females. In order to determine whether CORT is sufficient
for increasing FSL, we incubated slices from either single-housed males or group-housed females
with 100 nM CORT for 1 hr prior to electrophysiological assessment. This incubation time is sufficient
to
mimic
CORT-dependent
changes
in
synaptic
metaplasticity
observed
after
acute
stress (Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013a). CORT-incubation increased FSL in slices from single-
housed males (59.2 ± 4.1 ms, n = 36, p<0.021 vs malesingle) and in slices from group-housed females
(64.1 ± 4.8 ms, n = 32, p<0.0001 vs femalegroup, Figure 3f). Collectively, these observations demon-
strate that CORT is both necessary (during stress) and sufficient (in the absence of stress) to increase
FSL in male and female mice.
Next we investigated the underlying conductance that controls FSL in single-housed males and
females. A rapidly activating, rapidly inactivating potassium (K) conductance contributes to FSL in a
number of different cell types throughout the nervous system (Meng et al., 2011). The channels
responsible for this conductance are largely inactive at resting membrane potential, but this inactiva-
tion can be removed by a membrane hyperpolarization (Yellen, 2002; Maffie and Rudy, 2008). To
test whether similar K channels contribute to the FSL in CRH neurons, we conducted experiments in
which we did not deliver a membrane hyperpolarization prior to a depolarizing current step. The
absence of this hyperpolarizing pre-pulse decreased the FSL in CRH neurons from socially-isolated
females (FSLnoHP: 37.8 ± 3.1 ms vs FSLHP: 55.3 ± 4.5 ms, paired t-test, p=0.0022, Figure 4—
figure supplement 1). Rapidly activating and inactivating K currents are sensitive to millimolar con-
centrations of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) (Alexander et al., 2015), and consistent with this, we
observed shorter FSL in the presence of 2 mM 4-AP (FSL4-AP: 36.8 ± 5.6 ms vs FSLcontrol: 62.8 ± 7.6
ms unpaired t-test, p=0.015 n = 8, Figure 4a). We obtained voltage clamp recordings and

 characterized the currents responsible for regulating FSL (malesingle n = 11, femalesingle n = 12).
These currents were largely inactive at resting membrane potential, inactivated quickly and required
membrane hyperpolarization to relieve inactivation (Figure 4b). They were partially blocked by
2 mM 4-AP, fully blocked by 6 mM 4-AP (n = 4, Figure 4c), but were unaffected by a lower
concentration of 4-AP(500 uM, data not shown) (Anderson et al., 2010). In addition, these currents
were insensitive to 20 mM TEA (data not shown). Neurons from socially-isolated females showed no
difference in activation or recovery from inactivation in comparison to isolated males (Figure 4d).
There was no difference in current density in socially-isolated females when compared to socially-iso-
lated males (data not shown), arguing against an increase in channel number or conductance. We
next asked whether channel kinetics might explain the differences in FSL. There was no difference in
the activation kinetics between males and females, but currents from female mice had a longer
decay time constant in comparison to males (tfemale single: 55.8 ± 5.6 ms, n = 11, vs tmale single: 41.9 ±
2.9 ms, n = 11, unpaired t-test, p=0.019, Figure 4e,f). These findings indicate that a slowing in the
decay of a rapidly activating, rapidly inactivating voltage-gated K current is causative for the increase
in FSL.

 Next, we asked whether these differences in the biophysical properties of the rapidly inactivating
K current observed in socially-isolated females compared to males would be sufficient to alter the
spike output of CRH neurons. We conducted experiments in which depolarizing current steps
(20 pA intervals) were preceded by a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse. CRH neurons from female isolated
mice required a greater depolarization to generate a spike compared to CRH neurons from socially
isolated males. This is revealed as a rightward shift in the relationship between spike probability and
current step (female: I50 = 49.5 ± 1.2 mV, n = 104 vs male: I50 = 55.0 ± 1.6 mV, n = 88, p<0.0001,
K-S statistic). Finally, we compared the excitability of CRH neurons from isolated females and males.
We used a protocol (hyperpolarizing pre-pulse followed by a family of depolarizing steps) that
allowed for maximal activation of the rapidly activating K current described above. The rightward
shift in the F-I plot indicates that CRH neurons from isolated females had lower excitability in com-
parison to isolated males (p<0.0001, K-S statistic, Figure 5b).
Discussion
Our findings demonstrate that brief social isolation (<24 hr) affects the biophysical properties of
PVN CRH neurons in a sexually dimorphic fashion. We report an increase in FSL and a decrease in
neuronal excitability in socially-isolated female, but not in age-matched, male mice. By contrast, an
acute physical stress (swim) increased FSL in group-housed females and single-housed males. In
addition, social isolation occluded the effects of swim stress on female mice. CORT is both necessary
for the isolation (females) and swim stress (males and females) induced increases in FSL and sufficient
to increase FSL in the absence of stress. Finally, we noted the effect of social isolation was graded in
female mice with paired mice exhibiting FSLs that were intermediate to those observed from group-
housed or single mice.

 We examined the underlying conductance and report that it is sensitive to millimolar concentra-
tions of 4-AP and insensitive to millimolar concentrations of TEA. In addition, FSL was profoundly
sensitive to pre-hyperpolarizing pulses, which remove channel inactivation and make rapidly inacti-
vating K channels available for opening in response to depolarizations. The features of these chan-
nels are consistent with Kv4 channels previously described in the PVN (Lee et al., 2012). They do,
however, exhibit a more hyperpolarized activation threshold in comparison to kinetically similar 4-AP
sensitive channels reported in PVN parvocellular neurosecretory cells in rat (Luther and Tasker,
2000). We failed to note any differences in overall current density or voltage-dependent activation
or recovery from inactivation. We did, however, observe an increase in the decay time constant of
rapidly inactivating K currents in socially-isolated female mice compared to male mice, providing a
potential underlying mechanism for the prolonged FSL in response to depolarization. The longer
FSL we observed is not a classically defined characteristic of CRH neurons and, in fact, the absence
of this delay has been used previously to categorize putative CRH neurons (Hoffman et al., 1991;
Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013b).
Our findings demonstrate that the biophysical characteristics of neurons are flexible and exqui-
sitely sensitive to specific experiences. Whilst synaptic changes in the PVN (Inoue et al., 2013;
Kuzmiski et al., 2010; Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013a) and other brain regions have been inves-
tigated, this is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first reports of rapid intrinsic plasticity in
neurons following acute stress. Our observations add to a number of observations that intrinsic (syn-
apse
autonomous)
plasticity
can
have
a
profound
effect
on
the
output
of
neural
networks (Shah et al., 2010; Kourrich et al., 2015;O’Leary et al., 2014). In addition, as electrical
fingerprints have been used to identify specific cell types, investigators should use caution when
interpreting the data as the physiological or psychological state of the animal may have a dramatic
impact on these fingerprints. Similarly, since neurons in the PVN can express multiple neuromodula-
tors, caution must also be exercised when interpreting data from a genetically identified cell popula-
tion. We have previously shown, using immunohistochemistry, that overlap between the genetically
identified CRH cell population in PVN and non-CRH neurons is minimal (<5% for vasopressin/CRH or
oxytocin/CRH;
<<1%
for
thyrotropin
releasing
hormone/CRH
or
somatostatin/CRH)
(Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013b).
These findings demonstrate that males and females react differently to some stressors but not
others. Specifically, social isolation has definitive, CORT-dependent effects on CRH neurons in
female, but not male mice. By contrast, both males and females show indistinguishable responses to
an acute physical swim stress. These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering both
the sex of the animal and the stressor modality when designing studies investigating neurobiological
effects of stress. Indeed recent work demonstrating sex-specific expression of fear responses in
rodents (Gruene et al., 2015) serves as a corollary to our observations and when taken together
suggests that strategies for coping with stress are sex-specific. In particular, our findings highlight
the importance of a social network in females and provides a neurobiological framework for further
testing the underlying thesis of ‘tend and befriend’ strategy for females in response to
stress (Taylor et al., 2000). Finally, as our observations report sex-specific differences in response to
stress in the first two weeks post-weaning, they provide clear evidence for biological effects on the
stress axis that are independent of circulating gonadal hormones (McCarthy and Arnold, 2011).
This exquisite sensitivity of the brain during the pre-adolescent period (Foilb et al., 2011) raises
intriguing questions about the long-term consequences of subtle environmental and social manipula-
tions on stress responses and behavior in males and females later in life.

age (Nelson et al., 1990; Mayer et al., 2010). Mice were individually housed on a 12 hr:12 hr light:
dark cycle (lights on at 7:00) with ad libitum access to food and water. Pairs of either homozygous
Crh-IRES-Cre or Ai14 genotypes were mated, and the resulting heterozygous Crh-IRES-Cre;Ai14 off-
spring used in subsequent experiments. Sixteen hours prior to the acute stress protocol or slice
preparation, mice were housed either individually, in same-sex pairs or same-sex groups (3–5 mice
per group). Single or group -housed mice were randomly assigned to naive or stress conditions. For
stress experiments, mice were exposed to a forced swim stress (between 8:00 and 9:30 during the
light phase) consisting of 20 min in a glass cylinder (14 cm internal diameter) filled with 30–32˚C
water. Following one hour of recovery in their home cage, mice were anesthetized and brain slices
were prepared as described below.
Slice preparation
Experimental animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The brain was quickly
removed, and coronal brain slices (250 mm) containing the PVN of the hypothalamus were obtained
using a vibrating slicer (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) while submerged in ice cold slicing solution (0˚C,
95% O2/5% CO2 saturated), containing (in mM): 87 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 25 NaHCO3,
25 D-glucose, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 75 sucrose. Slices were then allowed a recovery period, of a minimum
60 min, in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (32.5˚C, 95% O2/5% CO2 saturated) containing (in
mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose. The CORT
synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone was dissolved in polyethylene glycol and injected i.p. 60 min prior to
swim stress at a dose of 75 mg/kg in a volume of 50 mL. For female isolation experiments, CORT
was dissolved in the drinking water (500 mg/ml) and given for 24 hr prior to isolation and during the
entire isolation period.
Electrophysiology
Hypothalamic slices were transferred to a recording chamber and superfused with 30–32˚C aCSF at
a flow rate of 1–2 ml/min. Slices were visualized using an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus) fit-
ted with infrared differential interference contrast optics. CRH neurons were identified by their
expression of tdTomato. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from CRH neurons using
borosilicate glass microelectrodes with tip resistance between 2–5 MW. The normal intracellular solu-
tion contained (in mM): 108 K-gluconate, 2 MgCl2, 8 Na-gluconate, 8 KCl, 1 K2-EGTA, 4 K2-ATP, and
0.3 Na3-GTP buffered with 10 mM HEPES. For images of filled cells, 0.2 mM Alexa-488 hydrazide
and 10 mg�mL�1 biocytin were added to internal solution. Microscope images were captured using
a Retiga EXi camera (Qimaging) and processed using ImageJ.
Recordings were amplified using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City,
CA), low-pass filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz using the Digidata 1322 (Molecular Devices).
Data were recorded (pClamp 9.2; Molecular Devices) and stored on a computer for offline analysis.
During all experiments, initial access resistance (Ra) was below 20 MW. Cell membrane properties
were monitored for the duration of the experiments and only recordings in which changes to Ra Cm
did not exceed 15% were accepted for analysis. For synaptic experiments, the cell membrane was
voltage clamped at �80 mV. Spontaneous inhibitory ionotropic GABAA receptor postsynaptic cur-
rents (sIPSCs) were isolated by blocking AMPA- and kainate-receptor-mediated glutamatergic syn-
aptic
transmission
with
6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione
(DNQX,
10 mM).
When
measuring
spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), the GABAA channel blocker picrotoxin
(100 mM) was included in the bath to isolate excitatory currents mediated by AMPA and kainate
receptors. These spontaneous currents representing stochastic transmitter release were analyzed
using MiniAnalysis 6.0.3 (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). Event detection was set at three times the base-
line noise and confirmed as synaptic events by eye.

 To determine RMP, cells were recorded in zero current (I = 0) mode. Latency to spike initiation
and firing thresholds were both measured using a current clamp depolarization step protocols. First,
a baseline current injection that maintained the membrane voltage near �80 mV was chosen individ-
ually for each cell, which served to exclude the possible confounding influence of variable resting
membrane potentials between cells. Next, a 200 ms/30 pA hyperpolarizing current injection was
given followed by 250 ms/20 pA depolarizing current steps up to 140 pA. The latency time was mea-
sured as the duration from the point of initiating the depolarizing pulse to the initiation of the first
spike. Firing threshold was determined as the membrane potential at the initiation of the first spike.
Both firing threshold and membrane potential are corrected for a liquid junction potential of 12 mV,
as calculated with solution ion concentrations.
In experiments examining cell properties following 4-AP administration, baseline recordings were
obtained, and then a ten-minute treatment period was allowed before secondary data were
obtained. Synaptic currents were evoked by paired afferent stimulation (every 5 s with an interstimu-
lus interval of 50 ms) and analyzed using Clampfit 9.2 (Molecular Devices). Evoked postsynaptic cur-
rent (ePSC) amplitudes were calculated from the baseline (current before the first evoked response)
to peak of each evoked response. The paired pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated using the ratio of the
amplitudes of the evoked pair (peak 2/peak 1) from a minimum of a one-minute epoch within each
cell. To isolate the voltage gated fast inactivating K current the following cocktail was applied to the
slices for at least of 15 minutes prior recording: Bicuculline 10 mM, DNQX 10 mM, dAPV 50 mM, TTX
1 mM, TEA 20 mM.
Data analysis
Each group represents a minimum of three animals for pharmacology experiments, or a minimum of
four for stress experiments. Data points are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses for
sIPSCs, and current clamp step data were performed in GraphPad Prism 4 using a one way ANOVA
for multiple groups followed by a post-hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; unpaired student’s
t-test were used for two group comparisons, and a K-S statistic for comparing two distributions.
Drugs
Drugs were dissolved into aCSF daily prior to experiments from frozen aliquots stored at �20˚C and
added to the bath by perfusion pump. The drugs were dissolved in accordance with guidelines
either in DMSO, PEG, ethanol or distilled water. DNQX, 4-AP, d APV and metyrapone were
obtained from Tocris (Tocris Cookson, Ellisville, MO). Picrotoxin, bicuculline, TEA and corticosterone
were obtained from Sigma (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). TTX was obtained from Alomone labs
(Jerusalem BioPark (JBP), Hadassah Ein Kerem, P.O.Box 4287 Jerusalem 9104201, Israel).
