Abstract
The widespread distribution of unconventional oil and gas (UO&G) wells and other facilities in 
the United States potentially exposes millions of people to air and water pollutants, including 
known or suspected carcinogens. Childhood leukemia is a particular concern because of the 
disease severity, vulnerable population, and short disease latency. A comprehensive review of 
carcinogens and leukemogens associated with UO&G development is not available and could 
inform future exposure monitoring studies and human health assessments. The objective of this 
analysis was to assess the evidence of carcinogenicity of water contaminants and air pollutants 
related to UO&G development. We obtained a list of 1,177 chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids 
and wastewater from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and constructed a list of 143 
UO&G-related air pollutants through a review of scientific papers published through 2015 using 
PubMed and ProQuest databases. We assessed carcinogenicity and evidence of increased risk for 
leukemia/lymphoma of these chemicals using International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) monographs. The majority of compounds (>80%) were not evaluated by IARC and 
therefore could not be reviewed. Of the 111 potential water contaminants and 29 potential air 
pollutants evaluated by IARC (119 unique compounds), 49 water and 20 air pollutants were 
known, probable, or possible human carcinogens (55 unique compounds). A total of 17 water and 
11 air pollutants (20 unique compounds) had evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma, 
including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, diesel exhaust, and several polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons. Though information on the carcinogenicity of compounds associated with UO&G 
development was limited, our assessment identified 20 known or suspected carcinogens that could 
be measured in future studies to advance exposure and risk assessments of cancer-causing agents. 
Our findings support the need for investigation into the relationship between UO&G development 
and risk of cancer in general and childhood leukemia in particular.

 1. INTRODUCTION
Unconventional oil and gas (UO&G) development is a complex, multi-phase process of 
extracting oil and natural gas from low-permeable rock formations that were inaccessible 
prior to recent technological advances in hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling. It has 
expanded rapidly in the past decade and now occurs in as many as 30 states within the 
United States, with millions of people living within 1 mile of a hydraulically fractured well 
(US EPA, 2015). Concerns have been raised about the potential exposures to water and air 
pollutants and related health impacts (Adgate et al., 2014). Chemicals involved in or 
produced by UO&G development may include reproductive/developmental toxicants (Elliott 
et al., 2016; Kahrilas et al., 2015; Wattenberg et al., 2015), endocrine disruptors (Kassotis et 
al., 2014), or known or suspected carcinogenic agents (McKenzie et al., 2012). The limited 
epidemiologic studies of UO&G development have observed an increase in adverse perinatal 
outcomes (Casey et al., 2016; McKenzie et al., 2014; Stacy et al., 2015), asthma 
exacerbations (Rasmussen et al., 2016), dermal irritation (Rabinowitz et al., 2015), 
hospitalization rates (Jemielita et al., 2015), and nasal, headache, and fatigue symptoms 
(Tustin et al., 2016).
Childhood leukemia in particular is a public health concern related to UO&G development, 
and it may be an early indicator of exposure to environmental carcinogens due to the 
relatively short disease latency and vulnerability of the exposed population (Rothwell et al., 
1991; Shy et al., 1994). The age-adjusted incidence rate of leukemia in the United States for 
children under the age of 15 was 5.3 per 100,000 persons in 2011, the highest among all 
types of childhood cancer, and the peak age of incidence is 2–5 years (CDC, 2015). The 
U.S. incidence rates for acute lymphocytic leukemia, the most common subtype of 
childhood leukemia, increased annually by 1.4% from 2000–2010 (Gittleman et al., 2015). 
Environmental exposures, such as ionizing radiation, benzene, traffic exhaust, tobacco 
smoke, and pesticides, have been linked to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, though 
evidence is generally limited or inconsistent (Bailey et al., 2015a; Bailey et al., 2015b; Tong 
et al., 2012; Ward et al., 2014; Wiemels, 2012; Zachek et al., 2015). A comprehensive 
review of the carcinogens and leukemogens associated with UO&G development is not 
available and could inform future environmental and biological monitoring and human 
health studies. In this analysis, we aimed to systematically assess the evidence for a possible 
carcinogenic/leukemogenic role of (1) water contaminants and (2) air pollutants associated 
with UO&G development.
1.1 Unconventional oil and gas development: description of the process
In oil and gas extraction, a well pad must first be constructed. This involves the use of 
construction vehicles, heavy equipment, and diesel generators in continuous operation to 
create roads, clear and set up a well site, and transport materials to the site (Moore et al., 
2014). After well pad construction is complete, drilling rigs drill vertically past the deepest 
freshwater aquifer down to the level of the source formation, such as shale rock, turn and 
drill horizontally for distances up to 3,000 meters (Laurenzi and Jersey, 2013). After drilling, 
the well is hydraulically fractured. In this step, large volumes of fracturing fluids consisting 
of water, chemicals, and proppants (sand or ceramic beads) are forced into wells under high

 pressure, creating fissures or fractures in the rock along the horizontal section of the 
wellbore to release oil or gas. Typically, about 15–100 million liters of fluid are used for 
each well, of which approximately 1–2% are chemical additives, representing a substantial 
volume of chemicals used per well (estimated as upwards of 114,000 liters) (US DOE, 2013; 
US EPA, 2012). Chemical additives in fracturing fluids include biocides, surfactants, and 
anti-corrosive agents (US EPA, 2015). After fracturing, wastewater flows up the wells. 
Within 1–4 weeks about 30% of injected fracturing fluids rapidly return to the surface 
through the well as “flowback” water; subsequently, “produced” water returns up the well 
more slowly. The produced water includes the injected fluids along with mobilized, 
naturally-occurring compounds (e.g., heavy metals, bromides, radionuclides) (Ferrar et al., 
2013; Vidic et al., 2013). Flowback and produced wastewater are stored in large open pits or 
storage tanks until they can be treated, reused, or disposed of offsite, such as in injection 
wells. Oil, gas, and produced water flow up the well for years or decades during the 
production phase of the well (Barbot et al., 2013; Nicot et al., 2014). During production, 
diesel-power trucks may be used to maintain the wells or transport oil or gas off the well 
pad. This stage also includes the processing and distribution of the produced oil and gas at 
other facilities (NYS DEC, 2011).
1.2 Possible pathways of environmental exposure to carcinogenic agents
Possible pathways of water contamination during fracturing and production include faulty or 
deteriorating well casings, equipment failure, surface spills of fracturing fluids or wastewater 
on-site or from tanker trucks transporting these liquids, migration of chemicals from 
fractures to shallow aquifers, leakage from wastewater pits, and unauthorized discharge and 
release of inadequately treated wastewater into the environment (Adgate et al., 2014; 
Brantley et al., 2014; Ferrar et al., 2013; Gross et al., 2013; Jackson et al., 2013b; Osborn et 
al., 2011; Rozell and Reaven, 2012; Shonkoff et al., 2014; US EPA, 2015; Vengosh et al., 
2014; Vengosh et al., 2013; Warner et al., 2012). Surface activities may pose the greater 
potential threat in the near-term (Drollette et al., 2015), with sub-surface activities 
potentially presenting a hazard over a longer period of time. Several water quality studies 
have measured total dissolved solids, isotopes, and other chemicals to characterize a 
geochemical fingerprint of UO&G development (Jackson et al., 2013a; Vengosh et al., 2013; 
Warner et al., 2013; Warner et al., 2012); these studies are not necessarily focused on 
compounds with evidence of toxicity to humans. Studies measuring concentrations of 
health-relevant chemicals in drinking water sources are emerging (Harkness et al., 2015; 
Hildenbrand et al., 2015; Llewellyn et al., 2015), but data are limited.
UO&G development activities that could generate air pollution include operation of diesel-
powered equipment, use of vehicles to transport materials and waste to and from the site, 
addition of sand (silica) to the fracturing fluid mixture, volatilization of compounds from 
wastewater, and processing and distribution of the oil and gas (Moore et al., 2014). Air 
pollutants, such as diesel exhaust, fine and coarse air particulates, crystalline silica, and 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are a few examples commonly cited as being 
generated as part of the various phases of UO&G development (Burnham et al., 2012; 
McCawley, 2015; Moore et al., 2014). To our knowledge, no comprehensive list of air

 pollutants potentially related to UO&G development is available in the published literature 
or government reports.
1.3 Epidemiologic studies of unconventional oil and gas development
Knowledge of the health risks of UO&G development is sparse, though epidemiologic 
studies on this topic are emerging. Studies using proximity-based metrics observed 
associations between UO&G development and congenital heart defects in children 
(McKenzie et al., 2014), self-reported dermal irritation (Rabinowitz et al., 2015), decreased 
birth weight and increased incidence of small for gestational age (Stacy et al., 2015), 
increased preterm birth (Casey et al., 2016), increased in mild, moderate, and severe asthma 
exacerbations (Rasmussen et al., 2016), and increasesd chronic rhinosinusitis, migraine 
headache, and fatigue symptoms (Tustin et al., 2016). The number of wells per ZIP code was 
associated with increased hospitalization rates, particularly in the areas of dermatology, 
neurology, oncology, and urology (Jemielita et al., 2015).
The only epidemiologic analysis of the association between UO&G development and risk of 
cancer published in the scientific literature reported similar county-level standardized 
incidence ratios for childhood leukemia before and after drilling of any oil and gas wells in 
any Pennsylvania counties during 1990–2009 (Fryzek et al., 2013). Also in this analysis, 
standardized incidence ratios were similar before and after drilling started in counties with 
unconventional wells, specifically. However, several important shortcomings of this study 
have been noted. For example, this ecologic study did not account for a latency period 
between exposure and cancer incidence. In addition, though the study objective was to 
examine risk associated with hydraulic fracturing, 98% of the wells included in the study 
were “non-horizontal” wells that likely did not involve the practice of hydraulic fracturing 
(Goldstein and Malone, 2013). Case-control studies of proximity to other petroleum-based 
sources provide some evidence of an association with childhood leukemia risk. Two case-
control studies in France reported increased odds of childhood leukemia among those living 
in proximity to the petroleum-based sources of petrol stations and automotive repair garages 
(Brosselin et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2004). Another case-control study reported elevated 
odds of childhood leukemia with proximity to petrol stations, but the relationship was not 
statistically significant, possibly due to small sample size (Harrison et al., 1999). Another 
study observed an association with proximity to petrochemical plants and increased odds of 
leukemia in young adults (20–29 years), but not children ages 0–15 (Yu et al., 2006). 
Additionally, a human health risk assessment found an increased risk of cancer for residents 
living ≤0.5 versus >0.5 mile from a well, attributable primarily to benzene, a known human 
carcinogen associated with leukemia risk (McKenzie et al., 2012). Taken together, these 
findings support the plausibility of an increased risk of childhood leukemia related to oil and 
gas development. The current analysis investigates whether there is additional evidence for 
the plausibility of a carcinogenic risk from air or water contaminants and provides 
information to improve the specificity of exposure assessments and human health research 
of the potential adverse effects of UO&G development.

 2. METHODS
2.1 Identification of potential water contaminants
We compiled a list of all chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluids, detected in hydraulic 
fracturing wastewater, or both from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) 
Appendices A of the progress report “Study of the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing 
on Drinking Water Resources” and draft report “Assessment of the Potential Impacts of 
Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas on Drinking Water Resources” (US EPA, 2012; US 
EPA, 2015). We eliminated duplicate entries and combined the entries for xylene isomers. 
This yielded a total of 1,177 distinct compounds or groups of compounds (1,043 in 
fracturing fluids only, 98 in wastewater only, 36 in both). The U.S. EPA developed these 
chemical lists from federal and state databases of well permits and construction records, 
industry disclosures and monitoring reports, trade journals, the scientific literature, and 
governmental and non-governmental reports. The fracturing fluid list contains a greater 
number of substances because it reflects reported usage and includes disclosed substances 
used across varying companies, locations, and geological formations. The list of wastewater 
constituents is shorter because it is based on the limited wastewater measurement data 
available from industry, government reports, or the published literature.
2.2 Classification of carcinogenicity of potential water contaminants
We searched the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monographs for 
evidence of carcinogenicity of the potential water contaminants. IARC is an internationally 
recognized authority on carcinogenicity of chemicals and other agents (Pearce et al., 2015). 
The monographs are written by working groups of international experts convened by IARC, 
and they provide detailed evaluations of the quality and strength of evidence of 
carcinogenicity of agents. The agents are selected for evaluation based on exposure 
prevalence and suggestive evidence of likelihood to pose a cancer hazard to humans 
(Tomatis, 1976). Other organizations evaluate environmental agents for carcinogenicity, such 
as the U.S. EPA through their Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) or the National 
Institutes of Health through their National Toxicology Program (NTP). Their lists of agents 
evaluated for their carcinogenicity contain much overlap with IARC and are less 
comprehensive; IARC, IRIS, and NTP have evaluated 1,050, 264, and 243 compounds, 
respectively (IARC, 2016; IRIS, 2016; NTP, 2014).
Chemicals were designated as “no information available” if they were not evaluated in an 
IARC monograph. For chemicals that were evaluated, we indicated their IARC 
carcinogenicity classification: carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), probably carcinogenic to 
humans (Group 2A), possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B), not classifiable as to 
their carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3), and probably not carcinogenic to humans (Group 
4). We calculated frequencies and percentages of the potential water contaminants in each 
carcinogenicity classification. For chemicals in Groups 1, 2A, or 2B, we assessed whether 
these chemicals had evidence linked to leukemia and/or lymphoma specifically, based on the 
available information on human and animal study data provided in the monograph summary 
or synthesis.

 2.3 Identification of potential air pollutants
We constructed a list of potential air pollutants associated with UO&G development by 
conducting a comprehensive review of the scientific literature. First, we systematically 
searched the biomedical and health-oriented PubMed database for papers published through 
December 31, 2015 using the terms “fracking air”, “hydraulic fracturing air”, 
“unconventional gas air”, “shale gas air,” “unconventional oil air,” and “shale oil air,” which 
yielded 136 unique publications. Next, we searched the ProQuest Environmental Science 
Collection database for papers published in environmental science-oriented journals through 
December 31, 2015 using the terms “fracking”, “hydraulic fracturing”, “unconventional 
gas”, “shale gas”, “unconventional oil”, and “shale oil” with the term “air pollution.” This 
search yielded 42 publications (31 additional, unique publications and 11 previously 
identified through PubMed). We included three types of studies in this analysis: 1) studies 
that collected primary air pollutant measurements or presented air pollutant measurements 
from secondary data sources, such as a state or county dataset (“measurement” studies), 2) 
studies that modeled air pollutant concentrations using inputs from primary or secondary 
measurements, emission rates from equipment or UO&G activities, and/or meteorological 
data (“modeling” studies), and 3) studies with qualitative assessments of potential or 
expected air pollutants based on review of the scientific literature, government or non-
governmental reports, and/or expert judgement about the types of pollutants likely to be 
generated from UO&G activities (“descriptive” studies). We excluded papers not directly 
related to environmental air pollution associated with UO&G development (n=86), papers 
describing generic chemical classes (e.g., volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) but not 
specific chemical names (e.g., benzene) (n=25), publications that were not peer-reviewed 
original research or review papers or were corrected and updated after 2015 (n=4), and 
papers written in foreign languages (n=3). From the 49 publications meeting our criteria, we 
abstracted chemical names of air pollutants from tables, text, and figures, if explicitly 
reported as present or predicted to be present at UO&G sites. For example, we abstracted 
names of target analytes from tables and figures presenting measured or estimated 
concentrations of pollutants near UO&G sites. This approach is consistent with the U.S. 
EPA water list construction, which included any compounds reportedly used in hydraulic 
fracturing fluids or detected in wastewater. We combined individual chemicals into one 
category if these agents were evaluated as a group by IARC (e.g. xylenes, particulate 
matter).
2.4 Classification of carcinogenicity of potential air contaminants
We searched the IARC monographs for evidence of carcinogenicity using chemical names 
of the potential air pollutants. Following the same procedure as for potential water 
contaminants (Section 2.2), chemicals were designated as “no information available” if they 
were not present in the IARC monographs; or else were reported as Groups 1, 2A, 2B, 3, or 
4. For the compounds in Groups 1, 2A, and 2B, we determined whether the monograph 
summary or synthesis indicated that there was sufficient evidence of increased risk of 
leukemia and/or lymphoma specifically, based on human or animal data.

 3. RESULTS
3.1 Carcinogenicity of potential water contaminants
Of the 1,177 potential water contaminants assessed, 1,066 compounds (91%) had not been 
evaluated for carcinogenicity by IARC. The 111 potential water contaminants evaluated 
included 14 (13%) known human carcinogens (Group 1), 6 (5%) probable human 
carcinogens (Group 2A), and 29 (26%) possible human carcinogens (Group 2B), and 62 
(56%) compounds were not classifiable with respect to their carcinogenicity (Group 3) 
(Figure 1). None were designated as probably not carcinogenic to humans, though only one 
compound has ever been assigned this classification. The distribution of compounds among 
the carcinogenicity classifications was similar between the fracturing fluid compounds and 
wastewater compounds (Figure 1). Of the 49 potential water contaminants classified as 
known, probable, or possible human carcinogens (Groups 1, 2A, 2B), 17 had evidence of an 
increased risk of leukemia and/or lymphoma (Table 1). This included 7 known human 
carcinogens (1,3-butadiene, benzene, cadmium, ethanol, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, and 
quartz), 3 probable carcinogens (dibenz[a,h]anthracene, dichloromethane, 
tetrachloroethylene), and 7 possible carcinogens (1,2-propylene oxide, 
benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, heptachlor, hydrazine, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, 
styrene). This list reflects petroleum-related volatile organic compounds (e.g., benzene), 
metals (e.g., cadmium), solvents (e.g., dichloromethane, tetrachloroethylene), and PAHs 
(benzo[b]fluoranthene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, benzo[k]fluoranthene).
3.2 Identification of potential air pollutants
Our literature review yielded 143 distinct potential air pollutants or groups of pollutants 
related to UO&G development from 49 studies (Supplemental Table S1, Table 2). Of the 143 
compounds, 97 had also been identified in water and 46 were unique to air. A total of 27 
studies included measurements, 19 used modeling, and 15 were descriptive in nature; some 
studies incorporated a combination of these approaches (Table 2). There were 31 studies of 
gas development, 1 of oil development, and 17 of both. Studies reporting primary 
measurements or modeled estimates of air pollutants were conducted mainly in Colorado, 
Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wyoming. Frequently reported air pollutants (reported in ≥5 
studies) included benzene, ethylbenzene, hydrogen sulfide, methane, nitrogen oxides, ozone, 
particulate matter, toluene, and styrene (Supplemental Table S1). Sampling locations 
included perimeters of UO&G well sites, mobile monitoring stations, and fixed community 
sites. Sampling durations varied, such as one-time grab samples of 2 to 3 minutes (Macey et 
al. 2014) and weekly 24-hour integrated samples collected over a period of two years 
(McKenzie et al. 2012).
3.3 Carcinogenicity of potential air pollutants
Of the 143 potential air pollutants, 114 compounds (80%) had not been evaluated for 
carcinogenicity by IARC. Of the 29 potential air pollutants evaluated, 7 (24%) were 
considered carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), 2 (7%) were considered probably 
carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A), and 11 (38%) were considered possibly carcinogenic to 
humans (Group 2B) (Figure 1). A total of 9 (31%) compounds were not classifiable with

 respect to their carcinogenicity (Group 3) (Figure 1). None were designated as probably not 
carcinogenic to humans (Group 4).
Of the 20 known, probable, or possible carcinogens (Groups 1, 2A, 2B), 11 had evidence of 
an increased risk of leukemia and/or lymphoma (Table 3). This included 5 known human 
carcinogens (1,3-butadiene, benzene, ethanol, formaldehyde, diesel engine exhaust), 2 
probable human carcinogens (dibenz[a,h]anthracene, tetrachloroethylene), and 4 possible 
human carcinogens (carbon tetrachloroethylene, chrysene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, styrene). 
This list includes constituents of oil and gas resources (e.g., benzene) and diesel exhaust 
(e.g., formaldehyde, PAHs, 1,3-butadiene).
4. DISCUSSION
We evaluated the evidence that potential exposures from UO&G development are risk 
factors for cancer in general and leukemia in particular. Our analysis of 1,177 chemicals in 
hydraulic fracturing fluids or wastewater and 143 potential air pollutants identified 55 
possible, probable, and known carcinogens related to UO&G development activities. 
However, the vast majority of chemicals (91% of potential water contaminants, 80% of 
potential air pollutants) were not evaluated for their carcinogenicity by IARC. Of the 55 
known, probable, or possible human carcinogens, 20 had some evidence for increased risk of 
leukemia and/or lymphoma: 1,2-propylene oxide, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, 
benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, cadmium, carbon tetrachloroethylene, 
chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, dichloromethane, engine exhaust (diesel), ethanol, ethylene 
oxide, formaldehyde, heptachlor, hydrazine, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, quartz, styrene, and 
tetrachloroethylene. These findings support the hypothesis that exposure to UO&G 
development could increase the risk of leukemia.
Our findings demonstrate the presence of known and suspected carcinogens surrounding 
UO&G facilities, but drawing conclusions about cancer or leukemia risk is challenging, due 
to the varied and limited water and air measurement data. With respect to water, for 
example, Fontenot et al. (2013) measured metals in private drinking water wells in a 
community proximate to UO&G activity and observed concentrations of the known 
carcinogen arsenic in exceedance of U.S. EPA Maximum Contaminant Levels, although 
possible sources included mobilization of natural constituents and hydrogeochemical 
changes in addition to UO&G activities. Drollette et al. (2015) detected trace levels of 
organic compounds, such as the known leukomogen benzene and possible carcinogen 
ethylbenzene, in private drinking water wells in areas with UO&G development in 
Pennsylvania, with highest observed concentrations within 1 kilometer of active UO&G 
operations. Although the observed concentrations were below U.S. EPA Maximum 
Contaminant Levels, cancer risk is generally assumed not to have a threshold below which 
there is a safe level of exposure.
With respect to air, our literature review identified six studies measuring hazardous air 
pollutants associated with childhood leukemia (e.g., benzene, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons) near UO&G facilities (Bunch et al., 2014; Macey et al., 2014; McKenzie et 
al., 2012; Pekney et al., 2014; Rich et al., 2014; Rutter et al., 2015). Differences in location,

 sampling duration, target agents, and sampling methodology in the air pollution literature 
hindered our ability to synthesize the air data and place it into context of human health risk. 
However, some individual studies used the air monitoring data to estimate cancer or health 
risk. Macey et al. (2014) identified concentrations of benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and 
formaldehyde in exceedance of EPA IRIS cancer risk levels; however, these were based on 
grab samples that represented high-exposure scenarios (e.g. ≤20 meters of UO&G separator, 
compressor station, discharge canal, and well pad). McKenzie et al. (2012) estimated risk to 
communities based on Colorado measurement data collected over nearly three years from a 
fixed monitoring station in a rural community. They observed an excess risk of cancer for 
residents living <0.5 mile from the nearest well, mainly attributable to benzene and 1,3-
butadiene. Bunch et al. (2014) used VOC measurements collected over ten years by the 
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality from seven fixed-site monitors in the Dallas/
Fort Worth area to conduct deterministic and probabilistic risk assessments and found that 
all but one of the cancer risk estimates were within the acceptable cancer risk range. Pekney 
et al. (2014) collected mobile measurements of ambient concentrations of pollutants in 
Pennsylvania and found no exceedances of National Ambient Air Quality Standards for 
criteria pollutants. These studies indicate that water and air pollution related to UO&G 
activities may pose a public health and potential cancer risk. More environmental 
measurements of health-relevant chemicals associated with UO&G development, 
particularly at residences in close proximity to these facilities, are needed to better 
characterize human exposures and determine whether confirmed or suspected carcinogens 
and toxicants are present and at what levels. In particular, studies with longer sampling 
durations or integrated over longer periods of time would be more relevant to chronic 
outcomes like cancer.
To our knowledge, our analysis represents the most expansive review of carcinogenicity of 
hydraulic fracturing-related chemicals in the published literature. Previous studies have 
examined the carcinogenicity of more selective lists of chemicals. For example, Kahrilas et 
al. (2015) reviewed the toxicological properties of biocide constituents of fracturing fluids 
and their degradation and reaction products and found that few had been evaluated by IARC. 
Compounds identified by Kahrilas et al. included formaldehyde (a known carcinogen 
associated with an increased risk of leukemia and lymphoma, identified in our analysis), 
dibromoacetonitrile (a possible carcinogen, identified in our analysis), nitrosamines 
(includes probable carcinogens, not identified in our analysis), and trihalomethanes (includes 
possible and probable carcinogens, four identified in our analysis: bromodichloromethane, 
chloroform, chlorodibromomethane, and bromoform). Stringfellow et al. (2014) assessed 81 
common hydraulic fracturing fluid additives and identified five confirmed or suspected 
carcinogens using the U.S. NTP carcinogenicity evaluations (Stringfellow et al., 2014). Our 
analysis also identified four of these five chemicals: ethanol (known carcinogen associated 
with an increased risk of leukemia and lymphoma), acetaldehyde (possible carcinogen), 
diethanolamine (possible carcinogen), and naphthalene (possible carcinogen). The fifth 
compound, thiourea, was included in our analysis, but was considered not classifiable with 
respect to human carcinogenicity by IARC. Colborn et al. (2011) abstracted a list of 
chemical additives of hydraulic fracturing fluids using information on Material Safety Data

 found that 25% of the 353 chemicals evaluated could cause cancer and mutations. However, 
the inclusion criteria for this carcinogenicity evaluation were not provided to make a direct 
comparison with our findings.
An experimental study on the carcinogenicity of hydraulic fracturing wastewater observed 
that immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to flowback water collected from 
unconventional natural gas drilling of the Marcellus Shale underwent malignant 
transformation and exhibited altered morphology compared to parental cells (Yao et al., 
2015). The flowback water sample contained relatively high concentrations of barium and 
strontium. However, these metals were not evaluated for carcinogenicity to humans by IARC 
and therefore were not included in our evaluation. Strontium was not evaluated by the NTP 
or U.S. EPA IRIS programs; barium was not evaluated by NTP, and it was deemed not 
classifiable with respect to carcinogenicity by the U.S. EPA.
Looking broadly at UO&G development and cancer risk, other risk factors should also be 
considered. For example, UO&G development could pose a risk for childhood leukemia 
through a phenomenon known as population mixing (Belson et al., 2007; Kinlen, 2012). 
This refers to the migration of new populations into previously contained rural areas, 
introducing new infectious agents. This could give rise to increasing underlying infections, 
for which childhood leukemia is a possible complication (Kinlen, 1988; Kinlen, 2012). An 
alternative hypothesis is that a delayed exposure to infectious agents among individuals who 
experienced an absence of exposure in very early life could increase the risk of an 
inappropriate immune response and lead to leukemia (Greaves, 2006; Greaves, 1997). 
UO&G development is a rapidly expanding industry that creates an influx of specialized, 
external workers into less populated areas to fill industry jobs (Brasier et al., 2011; Filteau, 
2015b; Jacquet, 2014). Additionally, previous examples of resource extraction or energy 
development have reported population increases up to 80% and worker influx-related 
impacts on public health and local communities (Ennis and Finlayson, 2015; Filteau, 2015a; 
Keough, 2015). More research would be needed to demonstrate risk to newly introduced 
infectious agents. Another possible risk factor for childhood leukemia is parental 
occupational exposures to agents such as benzene or PAHs from work in the oil and gas 
industry during the pregnancy period, a critical window of vulnerability for childhood 
leukemia (Fusion et al., 2001). In addition, parents employed by oil and gas companies 
could introduce contaminants into the home environment through clothing, shoes, and skin 
(Newman et al., 2015; Sahmel et al., 2014). Also, the introduction of bromide constituents 
from hydraulic fracturing wastewater into drinking water sources could increase the 
subsequent, downstream formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts and increase the 
risk of cancer, such as bladder cancer (Regli et al., 2015). Further, agents released from other 
components of oil and gas infrastructure, such as petroleum storage tanks (Zusman et al., 
2012), petrochemical plants (Yu et al., 2006), and petrol stations (Brosselin et al., 2009; 
Harrison et al., 1999; Steffen et al., 2004) could pose a leukemia risk.
This analysis has several limitations. The list of potential water contaminants from fracturing 
fluids is limited to non-proprietary chemicals that were reported to the U.S. EPA by oil and 
gas companies and included in the U.S. EPA reports on hydraulic fracturing (US EPA, 2012; 
US EPA, 2015). Our identification of potential air pollutants was based on information 
Elliott et al.

 available in the PubMed and ProQuest Environmental Science databases and may not 
include all potential air pollutants associated with UO&G development. The published 
literature may be more likely to report air pollutants for which health data are available, 
which could explain why a greater percentage of chemicals in air were evaluated by IARC 
compared to chemicals that were potential water pollutants. Additionally, IARC only 
evaluates chemicals with suspected carcinogenicity. Therefore, the proportion of known, 
probable, and possible carcinogens among those compounds evaluated may not be 
representative of the proportion of carcinogens among those not evaluated. Although the 
IARC monographs are the most comprehensive, systematic carcinogenicity evaluations, a 
comprehensive literature review of all 1,177 water contaminants and 143 air pollutants could 
identify additional compounds that pose an increased risk of cancer.
Conducting a well-designed sampling campaign for UO&G development is challenging, 
given the wide variety of potential target pollutants and the limited information available to 
identify which pollutants have the highest probability of exposure or health impact. Our list 
of 143 air pollutants associated with UO&G development (Supplemental Table S1) may 
serve as a useful resource for researchers designing future studies. Furthermore, our list of 
known, probable, and possible carcinogens linked to UO&G development can be used as a 
target analyte list for environmental or biological measurements in future exposure and 
health studies. Measurements of these compounds in air or water in residences proximate to 
this activity would provide insights into whether exposures are occurring and at what levels. 
Additionally, air pollution measurements corresponding to the different phases of UO&G 
development would provide critical information about the relative contribution of exposures 
from various aspects of the development activities and priorities for exposure mitigation. 
Furthermore, geographical and seasonal variations could influence release, concentration, 
and dispersion of potential air pollutants. Therefore, additional water and air measurement 
studies are urgently needed to investigate the potential for spatial and temporal variations in 
exposures.
This analysis could also inform design of exposure metrics for epidemiologic studies. 
Epidemiologic studies have generally used individual-level, geographic information 
systems-based inverse-distance weighted metrics to estimate exposure to UO&G 
development, which characterize UO&G development as a collective process. More specific 
metrics or measurements could offer improvements to the exposure assessment and potential 
insights into etiologic agents. Future studies could incorporate environmental and/or 
biological monitoring of health-relevant chemicals, such as the 55 known, probable, and 
possible carcinogens in water or air, and examine the relationship between chemical 
concentrations and proximity and density-based metrics, to determine the extent to which 
proximity is associated with exposure. Though more measurement data is needed to better 
understand whether exposures are occurring and at what concentrations, release of any 
carcinogens from UO&G development should be minimized.
5. CONCLUSIONS
There is a need to better understand the potential risks of UO&G development with carefully 
designed exposure and epidemiologic studies. We identified 55 known, probable, or possible

 carcinogens (20 compounds associated with leukemia and/or lymphoma specifically) that 
are potential water contaminants and/or air pollutants related to UO&G development. Our 
study provides some support for the hypothesis that exposure to UO&G development could 
increase the risk of leukemia. Because children are a vulnerable population, research efforts 
should first be directed towards investigating whether exposure to UO&G development is 
associated with an increased risk in childhood leukemia. Environmental and biological 
measurements of the compounds identified in this analysis in communities proximate to 
UO&G development would be critical for future research on the potential public health 
impact.

2We abstracted leukemia/lymphoma association information from the IARC monographs report of an association with an increased risk of leukemia and/or lymphoma. If the association with leukemia 
and/or lymphoma was not reported in the monographs due to no/insufficient evidence of an association with an increased risk of leukemia and/or lymphoma, or if there was a null association, we determined 
the chemical not to be associated with leukemia and/or lymphoma (“-”).

1All compounds were abstracted from the scientific literature through systematic review of studies (n=49) including measurement, modeling, or descriptive summary of air pollutants potentially associated 
with unconventional oil and gas development.
2If an association with leukemia and/or lymphoma was not reported in the IARC monographs due to no/insufficient evidence, or if there was a null association, we determined the chemical not to be 
associated with leukemia and/or lymphoma (“-”).
