BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines can potentially prevent greater than 90% of cervical and anal cancers as well
as a substantial proportion of vulvar, vaginal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers caused by certain HPV types. Because more than
38,000 HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed annually in the United States, current studies are needed to understand how relative
survival varies for each of these cancers by certain demographic characteristics, such as race and age. METHODS: The authors exam-
ined high-quality data from 27 population-based cancer registries covering approximately 59% of the US population. The analyses
were limited to invasive cancers that were diagnosed during 2001 through 2011 and followed through 2011 and met specified histo-
logic criteria for HPV-associated cancers. Five-year relative survival was calculated from diagnosis until death for these cancers by
age, race, and sex. RESULTS: The 5-year age-standardized relative survival rate was 64.2% for cervical carcinomas, 52.8% for vaginal
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 66% for vulvar SCCs, 47.4% for penile SCCs, 65.9% for anal SCCs, 56.2% for rectal SCCs, and 51.2%
for oropharyngeal SCCs. Five-year relative survival was consistently higher among white patients compared with black patients for all
HPV-associated cancers across all age groups; the greatest differences by race were observed for oropharyngeal SCCs among those
aged <60 years and for penile SCCs among those ages 40 to 49 years compared with other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: There are
large disparities in relative survival among patients with HPV-associated cancers by sex, race, and age. HPV vaccination and improved
access to screening (of cancers for which screening tests are available) and treatment, especially among groups that experience
higher incidence and lower survival, may reduce disparities in survival from HPV-associated cancers. Cancer 2018;124:203-211. Pub-

INTRODUCTION
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection among men and women in
the United States, with approximately 14 million new infections occurring each year.1 Persistent infections with high-risk
HPV (including HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) cause nearly all cervical cancers and a substantial proportion of
other cancers.2,3 HPV-associated cancers can be defined as invasive cancers at anatomic sites (cervix, vulva, vagina, penis,
oropharynx, anus, and rectum) with cell types in which HPV DNA is frequently identified—all carcinomas of the cervix,
including adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and SCCs only for the other anatomic sites. A recent
genotyping study estimated that HPV DNA was present in 91% of cervical cancers, 75% of vaginal cancers, 69% of vulvar
cancers, 91% of anal cancers, 63% of penile cancers, and 71% oropharyngeal cancers.4 However, cancer registries do not
routinely collect information on the presence of HPV DNA in cancer tissues. Therefore, to estimate the number of cancers
attributed to HPV, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) multiplied the number of HPV-associated
cancers by the percentage of each cancer type attributable to HPV based on the genotyping study. On the basis of these
attributable fractions, 79% of the 38,793 “HPV-associated cancers” diagnosed annually in the United States during 2008
through 2012 could be attributed to HPV.5
Many studies to date have focused on cervical cancers, because almost all of these cancers are associated with HPV
infection. Furthermore, cervical and oropharyngeal cancers account for greater than one-half of all HPV-associated can-
cers.5 However, in recent years, considerable attention has been given to oropharyngeal cancers and the role of HPV infec-
tion in these cancers. Although many studies have focused on the incidence of HPV-associated cancers, very few have

 examined survival, and most of these have focused on cer-
vical and oropharyngeal cancers.3,5-8 Survival reports on
less common HPV-associated cancers, such as vaginal,
vulvar, penile, anal, and rectal malignancies, are lacking.
Thus, to better understand survival in HPV-associated
cancers in the United States along with any disparities by
sex, race, or age that may exist, the objective of this study
was to examine survival among patients diagnosed with
HPV-associated cancers using data from the CDC’s
National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) from
2001 through 2011.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The NPCR data set includes cancer incidence data from
central cancer registries funded by the NPCR in 45 states,
the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.9 Data on all
new diagnoses of cancer from patient records at such medi-
cal facilities as hospitals, physicians’ offices, therapeutic radi-
ation facilities, freestanding surgical centers, and pathology
laboratories are reported to central cancer registries, which
collate these data and use state vital records to collect infor-
mation about any cancer deaths that were not reported as
cases. The central cancer registries use uniform data items
and codes as documented by the North American Associa-
tion of Central Cancer Registries. These data are submitted
annually in November to the CDC and are combined into
1 data set. Cancer registries demonstrate that data are of
high quality by meeting US Cancer Statistics publication
criteria. Information on primary site and histology is coded
according to the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology, Third Edition and categorized according to the
revised Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) recodes dated January 27, 2003, which define stan-
dard groupings of primary cancer sites (available at; https://
seer.cancer.gov/siterecode accessed December, 2016). The
data include information about diagnostic confirmation of
each case, including whether histologic type was determined
by microscopic examination of tumor tissue.
For the current analysis we used survival data for
invasive cancer cases diagnosed during 2000 through
2011 using the NPCR November 2014 data submis-
sion.10 We limited our analysis to registries that met the
NPCR data-quality standards for inclusion in US Cancer
Statistics publications11 and also performed active patient
follow-up or linkage with the National Death Index.
These 27 registries represent 59% of the US population.
We limited our analysis to invasive cancers that were
microscopically confirmed and met specified histologic
criteria for HPV-associated cancers using the same frame-
work as in prior studies.7,12 Cancers were classified by
anatomic site using International Classification of Diseases
for Oncology, Third Edition codes.13 All epithelial carcino-
mas (histology codes 8010-8671 and 8940-8941) were
included for cervical cancers (site codes C53.0-C53.9).14
For other sites, we included SCCs (histology codes 8050-
8084 and 8120-8131) for sites in the vulva (site codes
C51.0-C51.9), vagina (site code C52.9), penis (site codes
C60.0-60.9), anus and rectum (site codes C21.0-C21.9
and C20.9), and certain subsites of the oropharynx (site
codes C01.9, C02.4, C02.8, C05.1, C05.2, C09.0,
C09.1, C09.8, C09.9, C10.0, C10.1, C10.2, C10.3,
C10.4, C10.8, C10.9, C14.0, C14.2, and C14.8).5 Oro-
pharyngeal subsites (including the base of tongue; pharyn-
geal tonsils, anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars, and
glossotonsillar sulci; anterior surface of soft palate and
uvula; and lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls) were
based on sites in which HPV DNA is frequently identi-
fied.4,5,7,12,14-17 Although rectal SCC was not included in
the genotyping study,4 we included it in this analysis,
because recent studies indicate that rectal SCCs, although
rare, are similar to anal SCCs and probably misclassified
anal SCCs, and are likely to be HPV-associated.3,18
By using sex-specific and state-specific life tables for
all races and black and white race from the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics, we calculated 5-year relative sur-
vival percentages for patients diagnosed during 2001
through 2011 on all those who had follow-up through
2011. Relative survival was defined as the ratio of the
observed all-cause survival in a group of individuals with
cancer to the expected all-cause survival of the general
population. For this study, 5-year relative survival was
calculated using the Ederer II relative survival method.19
Relative survival was calculated for each of the HPV-
associated cancers by age at diagnosis, race, sex, and SEER
Summary Stage 2000 (local, regional, distant). For
patients who had multiple HPV-associated cancers diag-
nosed during the study period, all cancers were included
in the analysis. All analyses were age-standardized using
the International Cancer Survival Standard.20 Survival
was calculated only for white and black racial groups,
because expected life tables were not available for other
racial/ethnic groups. SEER*Stat software version 8.3.2
was used for analysis.21
Survival estimates were calculated as a ratio and esti-
mates with counts <25 suppressed. Formal statistical test-
ing for pairwise comparisons was not performed to avoid
multiple comparison problems. Ninety-five percent confi-
dence intervals (95% CIs) are provided to allow for infor-
mal

 in estimates is conservative, the sample sizes from more
than 10 years of national data are generally large for most
groups.
RESULTS
In total, 220,211 HPV-associated cancers were diag-
nosed during 2001 through 2011, and the majority con-
sisted of oropharyngeal SCCs (OPSCCs) and cervical
carcinomas (36.4% and 36.1%, respectively) followed by
anal SCCs (11.8%) (Table 1). When comparing survival
by cancer site, 5-year age-standardized relative survival
was highest for vulvar and anal SCCs (66% and 65.9%,
respectively) and lowest for penile and oropharyngeal
SCCs (47.4% and 51.2%, respectively) compared with
other sites (Table 2).
For many HPV-associated cancers, 5-year age-stan-
dardized relative survival decreased with increasing age at
diagnosis; however, we observed slightly increased survival
for cancers diagnosed among those ages 40 to 49 years
compared with those aged <40 years at the time of diag-
nosis for vaginal SCCs (66.6% and 62.7%, respectively),
vulvar SCCs (85.9% and 84.5%, respectively), and anal
SCCs (72.6% and 66.1%, respectively). Survival consis-
tently decreased with increasing age for cervical carcino-
mas, penile SCCs, and OPSCCs (Table 2). The difference
in 5-year relative survival was at least 10% higher for those
aged <40 years at the time of diagnosis compared with
those aged �60 years at the time of diagnosis for all HPV-
associated cancers, with the exception of anal SCCs, in
which the difference was <2% (Table 2). A greater per-
centage of cases were diagnosed at older ages for most can-
cer types, except cervical cancer (73% were diagnosed at
age <60 years), anal cancer (53% were diagnosed at aged
<60 years), and oropharyngeal cancer (51% were diag-
nosed at age <60 years).
Most of our study population was white (83%).
More than 85% of each of the HPV-associated cancers
were diagnosed among whites, with the exception of cervi-
cal carcinomas and vaginal SCCs, in which smaller pro-
portions were diagnosed among whites (77.2% and
80.9%, respectively) (Table 1). Five-year age-standardized
relative survival was consistently higher for whites com-
pared with blacks for all HPV-associated cancers, with
higher survival observed for cervical carcinomas (64.8%
and 57%, respectively), penile SCCs (48.4% and 34.7%,
respectively), anal SCCs (69.3% and 59.8%, respec-
tively), rectal SCCs (61.2% and 45.5%, respectively), and
OPSCCs (53.5% and 32.4%, respectively) (Table 2). The
lowest survival and the greatest differences by race were
observed for blacks compared with whites for OPSCCs
and penile SCCs (32.4% vs 53.5% and 34.7% vs 48.4%,
respectively) (Table 2).
When examining survival by age at diagnosis and
race, the largest differences in survival between whites and
blacks were observed for patients with OPSCCs ages 40 to
49 years (73.2% and. 40%, respectively), 50 to 59 years
(67.6% and 38.6%, respectively), and <40 years (76%
and 51.7%, respectively) at the time of diagnosis. In addi-
tion, large differences in survival between whites and
blacks were observed for men ages 40 to 49 years with
penile SCCs (58.5% and 34.5%, respectively) (Fig. 1).
For cancers that occurred among both men and
women, more than one-half of anal and rectal SCCs
occurred among women compared with only 20% of
OPSCCs (Table 1). Compared with men, women had
higher 5-year relative survival for anal SCCs (69.3% and
59.8%, respectively) and rectal SCCs (61.2% and 45.5%,
respectively) and slightly decreased survival for OPSCCs
(Table 2). The greatest differences in survival by sex were
observed for rectal SCCs.

HPV-Associated Cancer Survival/Razzaghi et al
Cancer
January 1, 2018
207
 More than one-third of all HPV-associated cancers
were diagnosed at localized stage, with the exception of
OPSCCs, in which 16% were diagnosed at localized stage
(Table 1). The 5-year relative survival rate was higher for
all HPV-associated cancers diagnosed at localized stage
and decreased for cancers diagnosed at regional and dis-
tant stages. The 5-year age-standardized relative survival
rate ranged from 59.4% to 86% for cancers diagnosed in
localized stage, from 41.2% to 58.5% for cancers diag-
nosed in regional stage, and from 13.3% to 31.7% for
cancers diagnosed in distant stages. The shortest survival
was observed for rectal SCCs diagnosed at distant stage
(13.3%). The greatest differences in survival between can-
cers diagnosed in localized and distant stages were
observed for vulvar SCCs (79% and 16.5%, respectively)
and OPSCCs (59.4% and 30.8%, respectively) (Table 2).
When examining 5-year relative survival by population
characteristics and disease stage at diagnosis, the poorest
survival was observed for men who had rectal SCCs and
for patients aged �60 years who had rectal and vulvar
SCCs diagnosed at distant stage (6.9%, 10.5%, and
10.9%, respectively) (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
This study is the largest population-based study of survival
for HPV-associated cancers in the United States, covering
59% of the population. Previous studies covered a smaller
number of the US population, ranging from <100 to
approximately 50,000 cases, whereas the current analysis
included 220,211 cases.22-30 Furthermore, this study is
the first comprehensive survival analysis for all HPV-
associated cancers that includes 7 cancer sites. We report
the highest 5-year age-standardized relative survival for
cervical carcinomas, vulvar, and anal SCCs and the lowest
for penile SCCs and OPSCCs. Our overall findings
include higher survival rates for whites compared with
blacks, with the largest differences observed among those
with OPSCCs, as well as higher survival rates for those
Figure 1. Age-standardized 5-year relative survival is illustrated for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers by race and
age at diagnosis (data from the National Program of Cancer Registries, 2001-2011). Cervical carcinomas were age standardized
to the International Cancer Survival Standard 2 (ages � 15 years). Vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal, rectal, and oropharyngeal squamous
cell carcinomas (SCCs) were age standardized to the International Cancer Survival Standard 1 (ages � 15 years). Data from the
National Program of Cancer Registries (2001-2011) were compiled from 27 population-based cancer registries that participate in
the National Program of Cancer Registries, meet the data-quality standards for inclusion in US Cancer Statistics, and meet the
criteria for inclusion in the survival data set, which covers approximately 59% of the US population. Note that statistics could not
be displayed for blacks aged <40 years for penile SCC because there were <25 patients.

 who had cancers diagnosed at localized stage compared
with those diagnosed at regional or distant stages. In addi-
tion, although survival usually decreased with age, we
observed slightly higher 5-year age-standardized relative
survival rates for those diagnosed between ages 40 and 49
years with vaginal SCC, vulvar SCC, and anal SCC com-
pared with those diagnosed at age �40 years with these
cancers, a finding that merits further investigation (eg,
whether there were differences by sex or human immuno-
deficiency virus status for anal SCCs).
More than two-thirds of cases in our study were cer-
vical carcinomas or HPV-associated OPSCCs. For
patients with cervical carcinoma, the 5-year relative sur-
vival rate was high, which may be because of screening
and early detection (almost one-half of cervical carcino-
mas in our study were detected at localized stage). For
patients with OPSCC, the survival rate was lower com-
pared with that for patients with other HPV-associated
cancers, which is concerning given the recent increase in
OPSCCs as well as the lack of routinely recommended,
population-based screening tests.31 Similar to previous
findings, we report that most HPV-associated OPSCCs
were observed among whites and men, and about one-half
occurred in patients aged �60 years.12,22,23,32,33 These
findings, combined with the observation that survival was
consistently lower among patients with OPSCC, is trou-
bling. Furthermore, similar to the report by Goodman
and colleagues, we observed that a large proportion of
HPV-associated OPSCCs were diagnosed at regional
stage; > 60% of HPV-associated OPSCCs, compared
with <40% of other HPV-associated cancers, were diag-
nosed at regional stage.7 The few studies that have exam-
ined whether there is a difference in survival by HPV
status among patients with OPSCC have indicated that
patients with HPV-positive OPSCC survive longer than
those with HPV-negative OPSCC.7,32 We could not
examine survival by HPV status, because our classification
of HPV-associated cancers was based on histologic type
and not on actual assessments of individual tumor status
for the presence of HPV DNA.
For other rare HPV-associated cancers, we observed
the highest survival for anal SCC and the lowest for penile
SCC. The published evidence about survival from these
cancers is limited and includes smaller populations as well
as various definitions of HPV-associated cancers. In a
study of HPV-associated anal cancers that included rectal
SCCs in the United States, Joseph et al reported that
more than one-half of these cancers were diagnosed in
localized stage, similar to our findings. Those authors also
observed higher survival among women compared with
men and among whites compared with blacks.30 Rela-
tively little is known about the epidemiology of penile
SCCs, and recent survival studies for penile cancers are
lacking.34 A small study representing 12% of the US pop-
ulation and with data from 1973 through 1998 reported
that the average duration of disease-specific survival
was < 5 years and decreased for localized, regional, and
distant tumors, which is similar to our findings of
decreased survival with advanced stages of cancer at
diagnosis.35
Several factors highlight the importance of primary
prevention of HPV-associated cancers. First, the inci-
dence of HPV-associated cancers increased during 2004
through 2012 in the United States, indicating an
increased burden from HPV infection.5 Second, the pro-
portion of OPSCCs in all age groups with HPV-positive
status increased from 21% before the 1990s to > 70%
today8,15,31,36; and, if increasing trends continue, then
OPSCC will become the most common HPV-associated
cancer by 2020.31 Third, our study demonstrated that
survival from HPV-associated cancers is poor compared
with survival from all sites combined (67%) and com-
pared with other cancers, such as breast cancers (90%)
and prostate cancers (99%).37 In the absence of routine
screening recommendations for any HPV-associated can-
cers, with the exception of cervical carcinomas, primary
prevention through HPV vaccine is essential, especially
for OPSCC, in which there is an increasing trend in inci-
dence. HPV vaccines are approved and recommended for
use among both boys and girls.38 Beyond primary preven-
tion, assessing tumor HPV status is essential for OPSCC
management and treatment, because some studies have
noted differential responses to therapy in HPV-positive
versus HPV-negative head and neck cancers.23,31,39-42
There are a few limitations to our study. The main
limitation includes the classification of HPV-associated
cancers, which was based on histologic criteria and not on
actual assessment of individual tumor status for the pres-
ence of HPV DNA. In addition, we were not able to
examine survival for any other racial/ethnic groups,
because current life tables are only available for whites and
blacks. Although, to our knowledge, this is the largest
study to date of survival for HPV-associated cancers
among blacks, the 95% CIs were wider for blacks than for
whites, indicating that comparisons should be made with
caution. Finally, treatment data were not available; there-
fore, we were not able to account for treatment differences
in this analysis.
Although it is not a limitation, it is important to
note that relative survival is not disease-specific and is a

 net survival measure representing the likelihood that a
patient will not die from causes associated specifically
with the cancer under study. Furthermore, patients with
cancer can die from comorbidities unrelated to their can-
cer diagnosis. A recent study concluded that, of all deaths
that occurred in patients diagnosed with breast, prostate,
colon, and rectal cancers at localized stage, a small propor-
tion were because of cancer compared with other comor-
bidities, and the proportions of death from cancer
increased with increasing stages of cancer at diagnosis.43
On the basis of the largest population-based study of
survival for HPV-associated cancers in the United States,
we observed large disparities in relative survival for HPV-
associated cancers by sex, race, and age, especially by race
and age for penile and oropharyngeal SCCs and by sex for
rectal SCCs. HPV vaccination and improved access to
screening and treatment, especially among groups that
experience higher incidence and lower survival, may
reduce disparities in survival from HPV-associated
cancers.
