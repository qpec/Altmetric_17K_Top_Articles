results.
The 6-step technique was microbiologically more effective at reducing the median log10 bacterial count. The 6-step technique
reduced the count from 3.28 CFU/mL (95% CI, 3.11–3.38 CFU/mL) to 2.58 CFU/mL (2.08–2.93 CFU/mL), whereas the 3-step reduced it from
3.08 CFU/mL (2.977–3.27 CFU/mL) to 2.88 CFU/mL (−2.58 to 3.15 CFU/mL) (P = .02). However, the 6-step technique did not increase the
total hand coverage area (98.8% vs 99.0%, P = .15) and required 15% (95% CI, 6%-24%) more time (42.50 seconds vs 35.0 seconds, P = .002).
Total hand coverage was not related to the reduction in bacterial count.
conclusions.
Two techniques for hand hygiene using alcohol-based handrub are promoted in international guidance, the 6-step by the
World Health Organization and 3-step by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study provides the first evidence in a randomized
controlled trial that the 6-step technique is superior, thus these international guidance documents should consider this evidence, as should
healthcare organizations using the 3-step technique in practice.

Hand hygiene is argued to be the most important intervention
in preventing healthcare-associated infection.1 Despite this, a
recent systematic review2 identified that there is limited
evidence to support hand hygiene techniques, and compliance
with hand hygiene remains suboptimal. There is little point in
getting the opportunity, or the “5 Moments,”1 correct for hand
hygiene if a technique effective in reducing the bacterial load
on the hand thereafter is not evident.
There are 2 main techniques in international guidance on
hand hygiene: the first of these is the World Health Organization
6-step technique,1 which involves applying a palmful of
alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) in a cupped hand, covering all
surfaces, and rubbing 6 different aspects of the hands.
This technique has a limited evidence base for use in clinical
practice because it was developed as a standardized technique to
test hand hygiene products in a laboratory setting.3 Furthermore,
this technique has no evidence of microbiologic effectiveness in
clinical settings with ABHR. The second technique is the 3-step
technique. This technique involves first, applying ABHR to the
palm of one hand and rubbing hands together; second, covering
all surfaces; third, continuing to rub until hands are dry.4 There
is some observational evidence base5 and 1 randomized
controlled trial (RCT) to support this technique on the basis of
shorter duration, although not for ABHR use specifically.6
Given that most hand hygiene opportunities in developed
countries uses ABHR and compliance is suboptimal, this study
aimed to evaluate the microbiologic effectiveness of the 2 current
techniques used internationally on residual bacterial load.

 or hand-rubbing with ABHR using the 6-step technique. The aim
was to compare the microbiologic effectiveness of the techniques
on hand coverage and reduction of bacterial contamination on
the hands of healthcare workers (HCWs) in a large university
teaching hospital in the United Kingdom, where the 6-step
technique was current practice. Ethics committee approval

Participants
Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were a nurse
or doctor present on the ward, providing direct patient
care not requiring the use of gloves or hand washing with
chlorhexidine, and if they agreed to participate. There were no
ineligible participants and 4 refusals. They were excluded if
they had a self-declared active skin condition at the time of the
study or had already taken part in the study, or if their hands
became contaminated during the procedure thus requiring
them to wash their hands.
All wards in the hospital were included and a random order
was used to determine which wards to study on a particular
day. Participants were informed about the study via email
and posters in advance of data collection, and in person on the
day by the researchers. Verbal consent was obtained from
participants to protect their identity and anonymity.
Randomization and Masking
To avoid staff knowing in advance, randomization was not
disclosed until the day of data collection. Sealed opaque
envelopes were used to randomly allocate participants into hand
hygiene protocols, either (1) 3-step or (2) 6-step technique.
An infection control practitioner who was experienced in hand
hygiene audit and a research nurse collected the data. A study
number was assigned to each participant using pre-numbered
data collection forms. The data collectors had no involvement in
the analyses or writing. The specimens were processed and
reported by a microbiologist (K.S.) who was masked to the
group allocations. The microbiology interpretation and analyses
were conducted by S.L. and C.R., respectively, who were both
masked to the allocation of groups.
Procedures and Interventions
The data collectors were trained in the study protocol and to use
glove juice technique.7 They observed the patient care activities
in the ward and identified activities involving direct patient
contact. Staff who had agreed to participate were then
approached for data collection. To standardize the techniques,
each participating HCW was shown a diagram on an instruction
card demonstrating the allocated technique and 3 mL of ABHR
(Softcare Med; Diversey), which contained a blend of isopropyl
alcohol and n-propanol, was used via a pump dispenser.
After the patient interaction, a glove juice sample7 was
taken by the data collector from the dominant hand of the
participant. Participants then used the ABHR, with the
respective allocated technique, after which a second glove juice
sample was taken. One data collector recorded the duration of
the technique with an electronic stop watch and collected the
glove juice technique specimen.7 Hands were then rinsed and
dried, and a handrub with a fluorescent dye (Spirigel; Ecolab)
was applied to evaluate adherence to the allocated technique
and hand coverage. Hand coverage was determined by
observation of the hands for any areas not covered with
fluorescent dye. To identify these areas hands were evaluated
under ultraviolet light following application of the dye. The
location and size of areas not covered by dye were documented
on a standard hand drawing. The total area not covered for
each participant was placed in one of 4 categories: 0%,
up to 5%, 5%–15%, and greater than 15%, on the basis
of the drawings.5 To standardize data collection one data
collector observed and recorded whether each step of the
technique was completed during application of the Spirigel
and coverage of the hands.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was residual bacterial load on
the hands of the HCW after using the hand hygiene technique.
Secondary outcomes included compliance with the technique
(%), hand coverage and sites missed, and duration (seconds).
There were no adverse events recorded and the ABHR
used was that of the study hospital, so no risk to safety was
anticipated with the study.
Statistical Analysis
A sample of 120 clinical participants was required to detect
differences, at 90% statistical power, with a mean bacterial load
of at least 0.38 log10 colony-forming units (CFU).6 Owing to
the lower number of doctors available on the wards, it was
anticipated that randomization would be performed in a
manner to allow more nurses to be recruited, if required, but
to maintain the 1:1 allocation of both nursing and medical
participants in each arm of the trial. The data were analyzed by
one of the authors (C.R.).
To rule out the influence from the prior hand hygiene
practice, we used ratios of the post–hand hygiene bacterial
colony counts over the prior hand hygiene counts. A linear
regression model was fitted to identify significant difference in
the ratios between these 2 hand hygiene techniques, using a log
transformation. A quantile-quantile plot was produced to
check the validity of the normal assumption and a Wilcoxon
rank sum test was used if there was a significant deviation from
normality. This test was used to examine the difference of the
time taken for hand hygiene and the percentage of the hand

 area not covered between the techniques. Detailed hand
part comparisons of coverage between the 2 techniques were
performed using contingency tables. A χ2 test was applied to
examine the difference in coverage and the Fisher exact test
was applied if the counts in the table were small. The same
procedure was applied to the observation data for duration
of applying the ABHR. The 95% confidence limits for the medians
were obtained from 10,000 boot strap samples. All analysis was
conducted using R, version 3.0.3 (R Core Team).
results
A total of 120 participants were recruited into this study on
weekdays (February 1 to March 31, 2014), inclusive of 78 nurses
and 42 doctors from 15 acute wards, including intensive
care units, and a range of medical and surgical specialities. For the
6-step technique, the median log10 bacterial colony counts before
hand hygiene were 3.28CFU/mL (95% CI, 3.11–3.38CFU/mL),
which reduced significantly to 2.58CFU/mL (2.08–2.93CFU/mL)
(Table 1) after hand hygiene. For the 3-step technique, there was a
smaller reduction, from 3.08CFU/mL (95% CI, 2.97–3.27
CFU/mL) to 2.88CFU/mL (2.58–3.15CFU/mL). The ratios of the
post-handrub bacterial counts over the pre-handrub counts were
significantly lower (P=.02) for the 6-step technique; the median
ratio of pre- to postcleaning bacterial load for those using the
6-step technique was approximately half the ratio for those using
the 3-step (median post- to pre-ratios were 0.31 for 6-step and 0.65
for 3-step). For the 6-step, the time taken was generally longer,
with a median value of 42.5 seconds (95% CI, 39.0–45.0 seconds)
compared with 35.0 seconds (33.0–37.0 seconds) for the 3-step
technique (Table 1). The regression results showed that the
time taken was 15% (95% CI, 6%–24%) longer for the 6-step
technique (P=.002).
Table 1 shows that for both techniques, the magnitude of
the area covered during hand hygiene was not related to a
greater reduction in bacterial loads. The detailed observation
data for hand coverage are summarized in Figure 1; the 6-step
technique generally covered more parts of the hands. Only 39
(65%) of 60 participants were fully compliant—that is,
followed the instructions entirely for the 6-step technique.
When the subgroup of those who performed the technique
correctly was compared with those who had not, a significant
difference was found in the reduction in bacterial load
(P = .01), in favor of those who complied 100% with the
technique. Among those fully compliant, the median bacterial
load went from 3.18 (before) to 2.08 (after hand hygiene) log10
CFU/mL, compared with 3.36 (before) to 2.55 (after hand
hygiene) log10 CFU/mL among those not fully compliant;
the median ratio of post-handrubbing to pre-handrubbing
bacterial load for those fully compliant was 0.31 times that of
those who were partially compliant. There was no difference in
time taken to perform technique (P = .51) or total surface
coverage (P = .14) between these subgroups.
The vast proportion of the colonies that constituted the
total aerobic bacterial counts were phenotypically identified as
staphylococci. With the exception of 1 sample, aerobic
bacteria were recovered from all pre–hand hygiene samples
and 103 (86%) of the 120 participants also had these
organisms present after hand hygiene. There was no significant
difference between technique used and aerobic bacteria being
detected;
49
(82%)
of
60
participants
had
detectable
bacteria on the hand surface after the 6-step and 54 (90%) of
60 participants after the 3-step.
The percentage of the hand area covered by the ABHR did
not differ on average between the 2 techniques. The detailed
coverage data are summarized in Figure 2, which illustrates
that the back of the hands and the fingers were generally less
likely to be covered in full compared with the palm of the
hands and the fingers for both techniques. The back of
the hands, the back of the thumbs, and the back of the
index fingers were most frequently missed regardless of the
techniques used. There was no significant difference between

with the back of the hands not fully covered (P = .002), but
there were fewer participants with the back of the index

and 63% (median [interquartile range] of 0.37 [0.08–1.06])
in nurses—that is, nurses had a 14.1% (95% CI, −61% to 54.3%)
greater reduction relative to doctors but this was not significant
(P=.64). Doctors and nurses achieved a comparable level of hand
coverage with similar areas of the hands not covered: a median of
1.2% for doctors and 1.1% for nurses.
discussion
This
pragmatic
RCT
with
90%
power
evaluated
the
microbiologic effectiveness of 6-step versus 3-step ABHR hand
hygiene technique in terms of residual microbial load, hand
surface coverage, and duration of application. Our results
demonstrate that, contrary to the findings from a systematic
review,2 the 6-step technique with ABHR was more effective
than the 3-step hand hygiene technique in terms of residual
bacterial load.
Contrary
to
earlier
observational
studies
on
hand
washing,5,8–12 larger coverage area of the hand was not related
to a larger reduction in bacterial loads. This may because the
6-step technique took a longer time owing to the greater
number of maneuvers required compared with the 3-step
technique. Other authors9 have identified that a reduction in
bacterial load can also be influenced by the amount of ABHR
applied to the hands. However, in this study the amount used
was the same for both techniques.
Nine (15%) of 59 participants performing the 3-step
covered all areas of the hand as defined in the 6 steps. This
indicates that specific site coverage, rather than overall
coverage, was much less effective in 3-step. For the 6-step
technique, the back of hands were more frequently missed,
whereas the back of the index and the middle finger of the right
hand were less frequently missed, compared with 3-step. Only
one other study6 has compared these 2 techniques to date, and
this study examined hand washing with chlorhexidine rather
than ABHR specifically and did not address sites missed, thus
the evidence arising from this part of our study is novel. Other

 observation by 2 researchers and use of a printed instruction
card demonstrating the technique, compliance with the 6-step
technique was only 65%, compared with 100% compliance
with
3-step
technique.
Those
participants
with
100%
compliance with 6-step technique had a significantly greater
log reduction in bacterial load with no additional time or
difference in coverage compared with those with 65%
compliance with 6-step technique (P = .01). This finding is
reinforced by previous studies,9 which have indicated that
compliance, after training, with the 6-step technique rose
from 31% to 74% in HCWs. Studies have indicated that
this reduces over time, emphasizing the need for ongoing
reinforcement,
education,
and
training.11
Unlike
other
studies to date,11 we found no difference in compliance
between doctors and nurses. Other studies have found
higher compliance with technique amongst nurses compared
with doctors.11 Our result may have arisen by the use of an
instruction card on the technique to minimize potential for
confounding from variation in prior training in hand hygiene
technique.
For the 6-step technique, the time taken for hand hygiene
was longer compared with the 3-step technique. This finding is
supported by previous work,6 wherein the 3-step was found to
be significantly quicker (26 vs 38.5 seconds; P = .04). Kampf
et al5 similarly demonstrated a median time of 25 seconds
with the 3-step technique. Time taken for hand hygiene
is an important consideration but microbiologic effectiveness
is more important. Although both of the techniques reduce
the bacterial load, it is not known whether the reduction
with 3-step is sufficient to stop transmission of healthcare-
associated infections. If it is, then efficiency in time taken may
make this a preferable option.
Our study had several strengths. It was an RCT in a clinical
setting.5 very few of which are seen in infection prevention
and control studies.15 It had a high recruitment rate with 120
(97%) of 124 agreeing to participate in the study. There were
no withdrawals from the study. The hand sites missed as well
as time taken and bacterial residue were measured; this is the
first time all of these have been accounted for in an RCT in
practice. We used the accepted gold standard in microbiology
of glove juice technique,16 hence providing an accurate
assessment of bacterial burden that can be transferred via hand
contact. The masking of the microbiologist to the assigned
protocols also strengthens our study because detection bias
was minimized.
There were some limitations. The glove juice technique
sampling
potentially
removed
a
large
amount
of
the
bacteria
present
on
participants’
hands
before
ABHR
application, thus overestimating the bacterial reduction.
Compliance with the technique may have been influenced
by
the
Hawthorne
effect
because
hand
hygiene
was
directly observed and assessed.17 Despite this observation,
compliance with the 6-step technique was only 65%. However,
as stated earlier, compliance was higher than in other
studies and probably higher than in routine practice because
HCWs
were
given
instructions
on
performing
the
hand hygiene techniques. Alternatively, 100% compliance
with hand hygiene technique may be unachievable in practice.
There were separate procedures for cleaning the hands
and using the fluorescent dye; thus, we cannot be certain
that participants did exactly the same technique in these
2 different procedures, limiting the attempt to correlate
bacterial reduction with the hand surface coverage.
To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence
of applied research from an RCT that the 6-step technique
is
superior
to
the
3-step
technique
in
reducing
the
residual bacterial load after ABHR hand hygiene. The reduc-
tion
was
not
related
to
coverage,
type
of
organism,
or staff group. Duration was longer for the 6-step technique
and areas missed differed for the 2 techniques. A potentially
simpler,
more
time-efficient
3-step
technique
was
neither better than nor equivalent to the 6-step technique in
reducing bacterial load.
