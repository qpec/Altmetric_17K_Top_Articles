Background-—The original non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) trials in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) enrolled
patients with native valve pathologies. The object of this study was to quantify the benefit–risk profiles of NOACs versus warfarin in
AF patients with native valvular heart disease (VHD).
Methods and Results-—Trials were identified by exhaustive literature search. Trial data were combined using inverse variance
weighting to produce a meta-analytic summary hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of efficacy and safety of NOACs
versus warfarin. Our final analysis included 4 randomized controlled trials that enrolled 71 526 participants, including 13 574 with
VHD. Pooling results from included trials showed that NOACs versus warfarin reduced stroke or systemic embolism (HR: 0.70; 95%
CI, 0.60–0.82) and intracranial hemorrhage (HR: 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24–0.92) in AF patients with VHD. However, risk reduction of
major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage was driven by apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran (HR for major bleeding: 0.79 [95%
CI, 0.69–0.91]; HR for intracranial hemorrhage: 0.33 [95% CI, 0.25–0.45]) but not rivaroxaban (HR for major bleeding: 1.56 [95% CI,
1.20–2.04]; HR for intracranial hemorrhage: 1.27 [95% CI, 0.77–2.10]).
Conclusions-—Among patients with AF and native VHD, NOACs reduce stroke and systemic embolism compared with warfarin.
Evidence shows that apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban also reduce bleeding in this patient subgroup, whereas major bleeding
(but not intracranial hemorrhage or mortality rate) is significantly increased in VHD patients treated with rivaroxaban. NOACs are a
reasonable alternative to warfarin in AF patients with VHD. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2017;6:e005835. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.
005835.)
Key Words: anticoagulant • atrial fibrillation • bleeding • stroke • valve
P
atients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a 4-fold increased
risk of ischemic stroke compared with patients with
sinus rhythm,1–3 and the risk of stroke is up to 17-fold higher
in AF patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis.1 Oral antico-
agulation with vitamin K antagonists, including warfarin, is
indicated for AF patients with mitral stenosis or mechanical
heart valve,4 and these 2 types of valvular heart disease (VHD)
were generally excluded from randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) that evaluated non–vitamin K antagonist oral antico-
agulants
(NOACs)
versus
warfarin
in
nonvalvular
AF
patients.5–8 However, the aforementioned trials actually
enrolled patients with other native valve pathologies,5–8
rendering the term nonvalvular AF a misnomer. The term
nonvalvular heart disease, used in the original NOAC trials,
may cause some clinicians to hesitate before prescribing
NOACs to AF patients with any form of VHD.
Several post hoc analyses evaluating the effect of NOACs
in comparison with warfarin in AF patients with VHD have
been published.9–11 A review of NOACs in AF patients with
VHD, based on the aforementioned publications, suggested
that little direct evidence exists to support treatment
recommendations in clinical practice12; however, relevant
data13 from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagula-
tion with factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-
Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) trial were not
included. The objective of this study was to systematically
review the totality of the published literature to qualitatively

 and quantitatively evaluate the overall efficacy and safety
profiles (ie, stroke or systemic embolism, all-cause mortality,
major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage) of NOACs,
compared with warfarin, in AF patients with and without VHD.
Methods
This study was performed in accordance with the recommen-
dations of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) statement.14 This
study
was
prospectively
registered
in
PROSPERO
(CRD42016052243). Regarding the Declaration of Helsinki,
because this is a meta-analysis of published articles, it is not
necessary to obtain approval from the locally appointed ethics
committee or informed consent from patients.
Data Sources and Searches
We searched PubMed (1966 to May 2017), Embase and
Medline (1980 to May 2017), the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and presentations at major
cardiology conferences within the past year (American Heart
Association, American College of Cardiology, European Soci-
ety of Cardiology) using the terms novel oral anticoagulants or
non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants or direct oral
anticoagulants or dabigatran or rivaroxaban or apixaban or
edoxaban AND stroke or systemic embolism or mortality or
major bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage AND valvular heart
disease or mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation or
tricuspid regurgitation or mitral stenosis or aortic stenosis.
There were no language restrictions. We also reviewed the
Introduction and Discussion sections of retrieved trials and
relevant review articles to identify additional trials.
Study Selection
Criteria for inclusion of a study were as follows: (1) The
study
design
was
an
RCT;
(2)
the
study
included
a
comparison of a NOAC with warfarin; (3) quantitative
estimates of the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence
interval (CI) were reported for stroke or systemic embolism
with NOACs versus warfarin among AF patients with and
without VHD. Studies were excluded if the outcome of
stroke or systemic embolism was not either prespecified or
adjudicated as a major (primary or secondary) end point.
Participants of any age and of either sex were included. One
investigator (M.L.) developed selection criteria and con-
ducted literature searches. Another investigator (K.L.P.)
assessed these criteria and independently checked the
enrolled trials. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion
with a third investigator (B.O.) and by referencing the
original report.
Data Extraction
All data from eligible studies were extracted by 2 independent
investigators according to a standard protocol. Discrepancies
were resolved by discussion with a third investigator and by
referencing the original report. Recorded data variables were
trial name, eligibility criteria, types of VHD, mean age,
proportion of women in the study, baseline characteristics,
percentage of persistent or permanent AF, baseline CHADS2
scores, history of stroke, history of myocardial infarction,
history of heart failure, percentage of prior warfarin use, renal
status, and follow-up duration.
Study Quality Assessment
All included studies were derived from RCTs. The risk of bias
(eg, selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition
bias, and reporting bias) of the original included trials was
assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias algorithm (http://
www.cochrane.org/training/cochranehandbook).
Objectives
The objectives of these analyses were (1) to evaluate
differences in baseline characteristics among AF patients
with and without VHD; (2) to compare the rates of stroke or
systemic embolism, all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and
intracranial hemorrhage in AF patients with and without VHD;
and (3) to assess the efficacy (stroke or systemic embolism,
all-cause mortality) and safety (major bleeding, intracranial
hemorrhage) of NOACs in comparison to warfarin in AF
patients with and without VHD.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Data on baseline characteristics are reported as median
and interquartile range, mean and standard deviation, or
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, compared
with warfarin, reduced stroke or systemic embolism and
intracranial hemorrhage in atrial fibrillation patients with or
without valvular heart disease.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are a reason-
able alternative to warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients with
native valvular heart disease.

 number and percentage, as appropriate. To explore differ-
ences in baseline characteristics among AF patients with
and without VHD, we pooled data across trials. Hetero-
geneity was considered significant when the P value of v2
statistics was <0.05 or the I2 value exceeded 25%. Because
the different types of NOACs may have somewhat different
treatment effects, a random-effects model was used. We
used HRs with 95% CIs to compare the rates of stroke or
systemic embolism, all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and
intracranial hemorrhage in AF patients with and without
VHD and to assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs
versus warfarin in AF patients with and without VHD. In
each study, we converted these values to their natural
logarithms, and we calculated the standard errors from
these logarithmic numbers with their corresponding 95%
CIs. For the statistical analysis, we combined log HRs and
standard errors using the inverse variance approach. If 2
groups of active treatment existed in a trial, we pooled
results only from the higher dose NOAC in a trial (eg,
dabigatran 150 mg twice daily in the RE-LY trial [Rando-
mized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy] and
edoxaban 60 mg once daily in the ENGAGE - AF-TIMI 48
trial). The Cochrane Collaboration’s Review Manager soft-
ware package (RevMan 5.3) was used for this meta-
analysis.15
Results
Basic Characteristics of AF Patients With and
Without VHD
The literature review identified 13 articles for detailed
assessment, of which 8 were excluded for not reporting
relevant data in patients with VHD and 1 was excluded
because it was derived from the same study population as
another report.16 Our final analysis included 4 RCTs that
enrolled 71 526 patients (Figure 1).9–11,13 The baseline
characteristics of these RCTs based on VHD status are
shown in Table 1. Of these patients, 13 574 (19%) had VHD
at baseline. The majority of patients with VHD had mitral
regurgitation; a smaller proportion had tricuspid regurgitation,
aortic stenosis or regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, or
previous valve surgery. The prevalence of female patients,
persistent or permanent AF, history of heart failure, history of
myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease, and prior
warfarin usage was higher in AF patients with than without
VHD (Figure 2). AF patients with VHD, compared with no
VHD, also had higher rates of moderate renal disease9,10 and
lower creatinine clearance.10,11,13 Patients in the ROCKET AF

 and without VHD, had substantially higher CHADS2 stroke risk
scores. The median follow-up duration ranged from 1.8 years9
to 2.8 years.13 The assessment of risk of bias in the original
RCTs5–8 is shown in Table 2, and all 4 relevant trials were of
good quality with low risk of bias.
Outcomes According to VHD Status
Pooling results from included trials, AF patients with versus
without VHD had similar rates of stroke (ischemic or
hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism (HR: 1.10; 95% CI,
0.95–1.28; P=0.04 for heterogeneity, I2=63%) and intracranial
hemorrhage (HR: 1.15; 95% CI, 0.95–1.40; P=0.35 for
heterogeneity, I2=4%). AF patients with VHD had higher rates
of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07–1.47; P<0.0001
for heterogeneity; I2=86%) and major bleeding (HR: 1.24; 95%
CI, 1.14–1.34; P=0.25 for heterogeneity; I2=26%) than AF
patients without VHD (Figure 3).
Efficacy and Safety of NOACs and Warfarin in
Patients With and Without VHD
Pooling results from the 4 included trials showed that the
benefits of NOACs in comparison with warfarin in reducing
stroke or systemic embolism were consistent in AF patients
with VHD (HR: 0.70;
95%
CI, 0.60–0.82;
P=0.60
for
heterogeneity; I2=0%) and without VHD (HR: 0.84; 95% CI,
0.74–0.94; P=0.13 for heterogeneity; I2=46%; Figure 4A).

Discussion
In this meta-analysis of 4 RCTs comparing NOACs and
warfarin in >70 000 AF patients, we found that one-fifth of
patients with “nonvalvular” AF had moderate or severe VHD.
AF patients with VHD were at modestly higher risk of all-cause
mortality and major bleeding than those without VHD.
Importantly, the benefits of NOACs in comparison with
warfarin in reducing stroke or systemic embolism were
consistent in AF patients with or without VHD.
Prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with AF cannot
be overemphasized. Traditionally, the vitamin K antagonists,
notably warfarin, have been the cornerstone for stroke
prevention in patients with AF17; however, warfarin has a
narrow window of therapeutic benefit, marked variation in its
effect in different patients, a need for a long-term coagulation
monitor, and increased risks of major bleeding, especially
devastating intracranial hemorrhage.18 Although the original
individual NOAC trials were designed as noninferiority trials
and not superiority, this meta-analysis of the pooled trials
shows the NOACs, in aggregate, to be superior to warfarin for
patients both with and without VHD. We observed substantial
heterogeneity in major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage
end points among AF patients with VHD for which dabigatran,
edoxaban, and apixaban reduced major bleeding and intracra-
nial
hemorrhage
versus
warfarin,
whereas
rivaroxaban
appeared to increase major bleeding and did not reduce
intracranial hemorrhage. Although rivaroxaban significantly
reduced intracranial hemorrhage overall in the ROCKET trial,
this effect was not seen in patients with VHD.16 Still, there
was no increase in mortality risk in VHD patients treated with
rivaroxaban versus warfarin. We noted that several recent
observational analyses of real-world outcomes with NOACs
have been reported recently. Those results have been mixed
regarding extracranial bleeding risk with rivaroxaban.
A meta-analysis comprising the overall patient population
of 4 large clinical trials showed that NOACs, compared with
warfarin, further decreased the risk of stroke or systemic
embolism, death, and intracranial hemorrhage in nonvalvular
AF patients.19 Although experts may well understand that the
term nonvalvular actually denotes that these trial patients do
not have significant mitral valve stenosis or prosthetic heart
valves, others may be hesitant to apply NOACs to AF patients
with other types of VHD. The current study makes it clear that
NOACs have similar benefits in terms of reducing stroke or
systemic embolism as well as intracranial hemorrhage in AF
patients both with and without VHD.
No dedicated clinical trial to date has compared NOACs
with warfarin in AF patients with moderate or severe mitral
valve stenosis, and so warfarin use in these patients is
suggested.4 The use of a NOAC, dabigatran, in patients with
mechanical heart valves was associated with increased rates
of thromboembolic and bleeding complications compared
with warfarin and thus is not justified for these patients.20
This study has limitations. First, a meta-analysis is a
retrospective approach, and subgroup analysis in patients
with and without VHD was not prespecified in the original
clinical trials. Second, AF patients with and without VHD had
different baseline characteristics, as did patients enrolled in
the 4 trials. Substantial bias might remain despite statistical
adjustment. Third, the RE-LY and ENGAGE AF trials used both
higher and lower dose NOACs as active treatment agents, and
their comparisons with warfarin were reported separately.
Because this was a study-level meta-analysis, we were unable
to combine groups of NOAC in a trial to create a single
pairwise comparison. Consequently, only data from the higher
dose NOACs versus warfarin were used in this meta-analysis.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis showed that AF patients
with native VHD had a higher risk of all-cause mortality and
major bleeding. NOACs, compared with warfarin, reduced
stroke or systemic embolism as well as intracranial hemor-
rhage in AF patients with or without VHD. Although evidence
supported increased extracranial bleeding risk among VHD
patients treated with rivaroxaban versus warfarin, there was
no increase in mortality risk. Our results further establish that
for AF patients with native VHD, NOACs are an attractive
alternative to warfarin for stroke preventive therapy.
