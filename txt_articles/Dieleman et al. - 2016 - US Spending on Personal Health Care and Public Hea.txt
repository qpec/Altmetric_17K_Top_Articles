 IMPORTANCE—US health care spending has continued to increase, and now accounts for more 
than 17% of the US economy. Despite the size and growth of this spending, little is known about 
how spending on each condition varies by age and across time.
OBJECTIVE—To systematically and comprehensively estimate US spending on personal health 
care and public health, according to condition, age and sex group, and type of care.
DESIGN AND SETTING—Government budgets, insurance claims, facility surveys, household 
surveys, and official US records from 1996 through 2013 were collected and combined. In total, 
183 sources of data were used to estimate spending for 155 conditions (including cancer, which 
was disaggregated into 29 conditions). For each record, spending was extracted, along with the age 
and sex of the patient, and the type of care. Spending was adjusted to reflect the health condition 
treated, rather than the primary diagnosis.
EXPOSURES—Encounter with US health care system.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—National spending estimates stratified by condition, 
age and sex group, and type of care.
RESULTS—From 1996 through 2013, $30.1 trillion of personal health care spending was 
disaggregated by 155 conditions, age and sex group, and type of care. Among these 155 
conditions, diabetes had the highest health care spending in 2013, with an estimated $101.4 billion 
(uncertainty interval [UI], $96.7 billion–$106.5 billion) in spending, including 57.6% (UI, 53.8%–
62.1%) spent on pharmaceuticals and 23.5% (UI, 21.7%–25.7%) spent on ambulatory care. 
Ischemic heart disease accounted for the second-highest amount of health care spending in 2013, 
with estimated spending of $88.1 billion (UI, $82.7 billion–$92.9 billion), and low back and neck 
pain accounted for the third-highest amount, with estimated health care spending of $87.6 billion 
(UI, $67.5 billion–$94.1 billion). The conditions with the highest spending levels varied by age, 
sex, type of care, and year. Personal health care spending increased for 143 of the 155 conditions 
from 1996 through 2013. Spending on low back and neck pain and on diabetes increased the most 
over the 18 years, by an estimated $57.2 billion (UI, $47.4 billion–$64.4 billion) and $64.4 billion 
(UI, $57.8 billion–$70.7 billion), respectively. From 1996 through 2013, spending on emergency 
care and retail pharmaceuticals increased at the fastest rates (6.4% [UI, 6.4%–6.4%] and 5.6% [UI, 
5.6%–5.6%] annual growth rate, respectively), which were higher than annual rates for spending 
on inpatient care (2.8% [UI, 2.8%–2.8%] and nursing facility care (2.5% [UI, 2.5%–2.5%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Modeled estimates of US spending on personal health 
care and public health showed substantial increases from 1996 through 2013; with spending on 
diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and low back and neck pain accounting for the highest amounts 
of spending by disease category. The rate of change in annual spending varied considerably among 
different conditions and types of care. This information may have implications for efforts to 
control US health care spending.
Health care spending in the United States is greater than in any other country in the world.1 
According to official US estimates, spending on health care reached $2.9 trillion in 2014, 
amounting to more than 17% of the US economy and more than $9110 per person.2 
Between 2013 and 2014 alone, spending on health care increased 5.3%.2

 Despite the resources spent on health care, much remains unknown about how much is spent 
for each condition, or how spending on these conditions differs across ages and time. 
Understanding how health care spending varies can help health system researchers and 
policy makers identify which conditions, age and sex groups, and types of care are driving 
spending increases. In particular, this information can be used to identify where new 
technologies and processes may yield a potential return on investment.
The objective of this study was to systematically and comprehensively estimate US spending 
on personal health care and public health, according to condition (ie, disease or health 
category), age and sex group, and type of care.
Methods
Conceptual Framework
This project received review and approval from the University of Washington institutional 
review board, and because data was used from a deidentified database, informed consent 
was waived. The strategy of this research was to use nationally representative data 
containing information about patient interactions with the health care system to estimate 
spending by condition, age and sex group, and type of health care. Data were scaled to 
reflect the official US government estimate of personal health care spending for each type of 
care for each year of the study. These official estimates, reported in the National Health 
Expenditure Accounts (NHEA), disaggregate total health spending into personal health 
spending, government public health activities, investment, and 2 administrative cost 
categories associated with public health insurance such as Medicare and Medicaid. Personal 
health spending, which composed 89.5% of total health spending in 2013, was the focus of 
this study and was defined in the NHEA as “the total amount spent to treat individuals with 
specific medical conditions.”3 In addition to estimating personal health care spending, this 
study also made preliminary estimates disaggregating federally funded public health 
spending.
The NHEA divided total personal health care spending into 10 mutually exclusive types of 
care, which included hospital care, physician and clinical services, nursing facility care, and 
prescribed retail pharmaceutical spending, among others. These types of care are not 
routinely ascribed to specific health conditions.2 To better align the NHEA personal health 
spending accounts with health system encounter data, spending fractions from the Medical 
Expenditure Panel Survey4 and methods described by Roehrig5 were used to group these 10 
categories into 6 types of personal health care: inpatient care, ambulatory care, emergency 
department care, nursing facility care, and dental care, along with spending on prescribed 
retail pharmaceuticals. Ambulatory care included health care in urgent care facilities, and 
prescribed retail pharmaceuticals only included prescribed medicine that was purchased in a 
retail setting, rather than that provided during an inpatient or ambulatory care visit. Spending 
on physicians was included in inpatient, ambulatory, emergency department care, and 
nursing facility care, depending on the type of care provided. Together, health care spending 
incurred in these 6 types of care constituted between 84.0% and 85.2% of annual personal 
health care spending from 1996 through 2013.2 Across all 18 years of this study, personal 
health care spending that fell outside of the 6 types of care tracked was on over-the-counter

 pharmaceuticals (6.6%), nondurable and durable medical devices (5.1%), and home health 
(3.6%). A detailed Supplement provides additional information about all the methods used 
for this analysis.
Spending on the 6 types of personal health care was then disaggregated across 155 mutually 
exclusive and collectively exhaustive conditions and 38 age and sex groups. Each sex was 
divided into 19 5-year age groups, with the exception of the group aged 0 to 4 years, which 
was split into 2 categories (<1 year and 1–4 years) for more granular analysis. Of the 155 
conditions, 140 were based on the disease categories used in the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) 2013 study.6 The remaining 15 conditions were associated with substantial health 
care spending but were not underlying conditions of health burden, and were thus excluded 
from the GBD or included as a part of other underlying conditions. Examples of these 
additional categories include well visits, routine dental visits, pregnancy and postpartum 
care, septicemia, renal failure, and treatment of 4 major risk factors—hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, obesity, and tobacco use. For these 4 risk factors, spending on the treatment 
of the risk factor was reported separately, whereas spending on the treatment of diseases the 
risk factor may have caused were allocated to the actual disease. For example, spending on 
statins for hyperlipidemia was considered spending on the treatment of each risk factor, and 
spending on treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD) reported spending for the treatment 
of the disease. Spending on these 4 risk factors was reported separately because of the large 
amount of spending associated with these risk factors and the ability to estimate this 
spending in the underlying health system encounter data. Spending on treatment of other 
risk factors, such as dietary risks or high fasting glucose, was allocated to the conditions 
resulting from these risks. All 155 conditions of health care spending and the major 
spending in each category is shown in eTables 8.1, 9.1, and 10.1 of the Supplement. More 
information about the framework of this study is included in section 1 of the Supplement.
Data
For the 6 types of personal health care tracked in this study, encounter-level microdata were 
used to determine the amount of resources spent on each condition and age and sex group 
for each year. An encounter was defined as an interaction with the medical system, such as 
an inpatient or nursing care facility admission; an emergency department, dental, or 
ambulatory care visit; or the purchase of a prescribed pharmaceutical.7 Health care 
spending, patient age and sex, type of care, and patient diagnoses were extracted from 
insurance claims, facility surveys, and household surveys. In addition, sample weights were 
used to make the studies nationally representative. Table 1 reports all microdata sources used 
for this study. Together, these sources included more than 163 million health system 
encounters.
The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey began in 1996.4 The Medical Expenditure Panel 
Survey was used as an input into the ambulatory, dental, emergency department, and 
prescribed retail pharmaceutical spending estimates. Because of the importance of the 
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to this analysis, this study made annual estimates 
extending back to 1996 but not before. More information about the data sources used for this 
study is included in section 2 of the Supplement.

 Identifying the Condition of Health Care Spending
In these microdata, households, physicians, or health system administrators reported a 
primary diagnosis using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) 
coding. In the rare case that the primary diagnosis was not identified and more than 1 
diagnosis was reported, the diagnosis listed first was assumed the primary diagnosis unless 
an injury diagnosis was included. With the exception of injuries occurring within a medical 
facility, injury codes, such as “fall” and “street or highway accident,” were prioritized over 
other diagnoses. This was done because many data sources report injuries separately from 
other diagnoses and it was unclear which diagnosis was the primary.
ICD-9 diagnoses were grouped to form 155 conditions using methods described in the GBD 
study.6 ICD-9 diagnoses related to the nature of an injury (rather than the condition) or 
diagnoses providing imprecise information, such as “certain early complications of trauma” 
and “care involving use of rehabilitation procedures,” were proportionally redistributed to 1 
of the 155 condition categories using methods developed for the GBD.6,8 More information 
about how encounters were stratified by condition is included in section 3 of the 
Supplement.
Estimating Spending
Spending on encounters with the same primary diagnosis, age and sex group, year, and type 
of health care were aggregated. Sampling weights were used to ensure that the estimates 
remained nationally representative.
On average, comorbidities make health care more complicated and more expensive.9–11 
Attributing all of the resources used in a health care encounter to the primary diagnosis 
biases the estimates.7 To account for the presence of comorbidities, a previously developed 
regression-based method was used to adjust health care spending. As a consequence, 
conditions that are often accompanied by costly comorbidities decreased after comorbidity 
adjustment, whereas conditions often considered comorbidities increased after adjustment. 
Thus, the adjusted spending estimates reflect the spending attributed to each condition, 
rather than the spending attributed to primary diagnoses. More information about adjusting 
the spending estimates for the presence of comorbidities is included in section 5 of the 
Supplement.
The spending estimates for each type of care were scaled to reflect the adjusted annual 
health care spending reported by the NHEA. This procedure is common, as no single data 
source offers a census of spending in all health care settings.12,13 This scaling procedure 
assumed that the spending captured in data used for this study was representative of 
spending in the total population. Spending was adjusted for inflation before any modeling, 
and all estimates are reported in 2015 US dollars. More information about scaling these 
estimates to reflect the NHEA type of care total is included in section 5 of the Supplement.
Addressing Data Nonrepresentativeness
Several data limitations made additional adjustments necessary. First, health care charges, 
rather than spending, were reported in the National Inpatient Sample, which was used to

 measure inpatient care spending.14 Because actual spending is generally a fraction of the 
charge, charge data were adjusted to reflect actual spending using a previously developed 
regression-based adjustment.15 This adjustment was stratified by condition, primary payer, 
and year because the average amount paid per $1 charged varied systematically across these 
dimensions. This adjustment allowed high-quality inpatient charge data to be used and is 
described in section 5 of the Supplement.
Second, to address concerns related to small sample sizes and undersampled rare conditions, 
a Bayesian hierarchical model was applied. For all types of care except prescribed retail 
pharmaceuticals and emergency department care, 2 or 3 data sources were combined to 
generate spending estimates with complete time and age trends, and to leverage the strength 
of each data source. A large number of models were considered for this process. The final 
model was selected because of its flexibility, responsiveness to patterns in the raw data, and 
ability to combine disparate data to produce a single estimate. The model was employed 
independently for each condition, sex, and type of care combination. More information 
about this modeling is included in section 4 of the Supplement.
The third adjustment addressed the fact that ambulatory and inpatient care data sources used 
for this study underestimate spending at specialty mental health and substance abuse 
facilities.4,14 To address this problem, spending on these types of care was split into portions 
that reflect mental health spending and substance abuse spending, and spending was scaled 
to an appropriate total reported by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration.16 This adjustment ensured that the total spending on mental health and 
substance abuse in these settings was commensurate with official US records. More 
information about this adjustment is included in section 5 of the Supplement.
Fourth, nursing facility care data were adjusted to account for differences in short-term and 
long-term stays. US Medicare reimburses nursing facilities for up to 100 days of care after a 
qualifying hospital event. To incorporate the best data available, Medicare data were used to 
measure spending for these short-term nursing facility stays, and 2 other sources of 
nationally representative data were used to estimate spending for nursing facility stays 
longer than 100 days.17–19 Spending on short-term and long-term nursing facility stays were 
added together and formed the total amount of spending in nursing facility care. This 
adjustment ensured the best data available were used to measure spending in nursing 
facilities, and ensured that disparate patterns of health care spending in short-term and long-
term nursing facility care were considered. More information about this adjustment is 
included in section 5 of the Supplement.
Quantifying Uncertainty for Personal Health Care Spending
For all types of care, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated by bootstrapping the 
underlying encounter-level data 1000 times. The entire estimation process was completed 
for each bootstrap sample independently, and 1000 estimates were generated for each 
condition, age and sex group, year, and type of care. The estimates reported in this article are 
the mean of these 1000 estimates. A UI was constructed using the 2.5th and 97.5th 
percentiles. Bootstrapping methods assume that the empirical distribution of errors in the 
sample data approximates the population’s distribution. This may not be true for our most

 disaggregated estimates. Furthermore, bootstrapping methods capture only some types of 
uncertainty and do not reflect the uncertainty associated with some modeling and process 
decisions. Because of these limitations, the reported UIs should not be considered precise. 
Furthermore, the UIs have not been derived analytically or been calibrated to reflect a 
specific degree of uncertainty. The UIs are included to reflect relative uncertainty across the 
disparate set of measurements. More information about generating UIs for personal health 
spending estimates is included in section 6 of the Supplement.
Estimating Federal Public Health Care Spending
In addition to the 6 types of personal health care spending, this study also generated 
preliminary estimates disaggregating federally funded public health spending by condition, 
age and sex group, and year from 1996 through 2013. Encounter-level data did not exist for 
public health spending. Instead, federal public health program budget data were extracted 
from the 4 primary federal agencies providing public health funding: the Health Resources 
and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the US Food and Drug 
Administration. For each of these agencies, individual programs were mapped to the 
associated conditions. Spending estimates were extracted from audited appropriations 
reports. A series of linear regressions was used to fill in program spending when not 
available. Population estimates and program-specific information were used to disaggregate 
program spending across age and sex groups. Because the NHEA does not include resources 
transferred to state and local public health offices in its estimate of federal public health 
spending, disaggregated public health spending estimates were not scaled. More information 
about how public health spending was estimated is included in section 7 of the Supplement. 
All data manipulation and statistical analyses were completed using Stata (StataCorp), 
version 13.1; R (R Foundation), version 3.3.1; Python (Python Software Foundation), 
version 3.5.1; and PyMC2,20 version 2.3.6.21,22
Results
Conditions Leading to the Most Personal Health Care Spending in 2013
Among the aggregated condition categories (Table 2), cardiovascular disease, which 
includes IHD and cerebrovascular disease but excludes spending on the treatment of 
hyperlipidemia and hypertension, was the largest category of spending, with an estimated 
$231.1 billion (UI, $218.5 billion–$240.7 billion) spent in 2013. Of this spending, 57.3% 
(UI, 52.6%–60.9%) was in an inpatient setting, whereas 65.2% (UI, 61.3%–68.2%) was for 
patients 65 years and older. Diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases made up the 
second-largest category with an estimated $224.5 billion (UI, $216.4 billion–$233.5 billion), 
and the spending was spread relatively evenly across ambulatory care, prescribed retail 
pharmaceuticals, and inpatient care. Of the aggregated conditions, spending on the risk 
factors (the treatment of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, and tobacco cessation) 
and musculoskeletal disorders were estimated to increase the fastest, with estimated rates of 
6.6% (UI, 5.9%–7.3%) and 5.4% (UI, 4.7%–6.0%), respectively.

 In 2013, among all 155 conditions, the 20 top conditions accounted for an estimated 57.6% 
(UI, 56.9%–58.3%) of personal health care spending, which totaled $1.2 trillion (Table 3). 
More resources were estimated to be spent on diabetes than any other condition, with an 
estimated $101.4 billion (UI, $96.7 billion–$106.5 billion) spent in 2013. Prescribed retail 
pharmaceutical spending accounted for an estimated 57.6% (UI, 53.8%–62.1%) of total 
diabetes health care spending, whereas an estimated 87.1% (UI, 83.0%–91.6%) of spending 
on diabetes was incurred by those 45 years and older. IHD was estimated to account for the 
second-highest amount of health care spending, at $88.1 billion (UI, $82.7 billion–$92.9 
billion). Most IHD spending occurred in inpatient care settings (56.5% [UI, 51.7%–60.6%]) 
and was accounted for by those 65 years or older (61.2% [UI, 57.0%–64.8%]). Spending on 
IHD excludes spending on the treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which 
contribute to IHD and for which treatment often requires substantial spending on prescribed 
retail pharmaceuticals. Spending on the treatment of these 2 risk factors in 2013 was 
estimated to be $83.9 billion (UI, $80.2 billion–$88.8 billion) and $51.8 billion (UI, $48.9 
billion–$54.6 billion), respectively. Low back and neck pain was estimated to be the third-
largest condition of health care spending, at $87.6 billion (UI, $67.5 billion–$94.1 billion), 
with the majority of this spending (60.5% [UI, 49.3%–63.8%]) in ambulatory care. Because 
cancer was disaggregated into 29 conditions, none were among the top 20 conditions with 
the highest spending. Estimates reported in this article can be interactively explored at http://
vizhub.healthdata.org/dex/ (Interactive).
Personal Health Care Spending by Condition, Age and Sex Group, and Type of Care in 
2013
Figure 1 illustrates health care spending by condition, age group, and type of care. Spending 
among working-age adults (ages 20–44 years and 45–64 years), which totaled an estimated 
$1070.1 billion (UI, $1062.8 billion–$1077.3 billion) in 2013, was attributed to many 
conditions and types of care. Among persons 65 years or older, an estimated $796.5 billion 
(UI, $788.9 billion–$802.7 billion) was spent in 2013, 21.7% (UI, 21.4%–21.9%) of which 
occurred in nursing facility care. The smallest amount of health care spending was for 
persons under age 20 years, and was estimated at $233.5 billion (UI, $226.9 billion–$239.8 
billion), which accounted for 11.1% (UI, 10.8%–11.4%) of total personal health care 
spending in 2013. Ambulatory and inpatient health care were the types of care with the most 
spending in 2013, each accounting for more than 33% of personal health care spending.
Personal Health Care Spending by Age and Sex
Figure 2 illustrates how health care spending was distributed across age and sex groups and 
conditions in 2013. Panel A shows that ages with the greatest spending were between 50 and 
74 years. After this age, spending gradually declined as the size of the population began to 
decrease due to age-related mortality. Spending is highest for women 85 years and older. 
Life expectancy for older men is lower, resulting in less spending in the 85 years and older 
age group for men. Estimated spending differed the most between sexes at age 10 to 14 
years, when males have health care spending associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, and at age 20 to 44 years, when women have spending associated with pregnancy 
and postpartum care, family planning, and maternal conditions. Together these conditions 
were estimated to constitute 25.6% (UI, 24.3%–27.0%) of all health care spending for

 women from age 20 through 44 years in 2013. Excluding this spending, females spent 
24.6% (UI, 21.9%–27.3%) more overall than males in 2013.
Panel B of Figure 2 shows that spending per person generally increases with age, with the 
exception of neonates and infants younger than 1 year. Modeled per-person spending on 
those younger than 1 year was greater than spending on any other age group younger than 70 
years. When aggregating across all types of care, those 85 years or older spent more per 
person on health care than any other age group, although this pattern varied across the 6 
types of personal health care and was driven by spending in nursing facilities. In all other 
types of care, spending per person decreased for the oldest age groups, a pattern that has 
been observed elsewhere.23 Although more was spent on females than males for every age 
group starting at age 15, spending per person in 2013 shows a different pattern. Estimated 
spending per person was greater among females than males for age 15 through 64 years and 
for age 75 years and older, whereas spending per person was greater among males than 
females for age 65 through 74 years and for younger than 15 years. Across all ages and 
conditions that were present for both sexes, the greatest absolute difference between female 
and male estimated spending per person was for IHD, for which males were estimated to 
spend more, and for depressive disorders and Alzheimer disease and other dementias, for 
which females were estimated to spend more.
Changes in US Personal Health Care Spending, 1996–2013
Between 1996 and 2013, health care spending was estimated to increase between 3% and 
4% annually for most age groups. Annual growth was estimated to be highest for emergency 
care (6.4%) and prescribed retail pharmaceuticals (5.6%). Figure 3 and Figure 4 highlight 
the conditions with the greatest rates of annualized spending growth by condition. Growth 
rates vary across the age groups. Of conditions with at least $10 billion of spending in 1996, 
spending on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was estimated to have increased the 
fastest for age 0 to 19 years (5.9% annually [UI, 3.5%–8.1%]), whereas spending on 
diabetes had the highest annual growth rates for those aged 20 to 44 years. In the older 2 age 
groups (45–64 years and ≥65 years), it was estimated that annual spending for 
hyperlipidemia increased faster than any other condition. Other conditions that had large 
rates of annualized increase were septicemia and low back and neck pain. Figure 5 shows 
total increase in spending and the 7 conditions with the largest absolute increase in spending. 
Diabetes increased $64.4 billion (UI, $57.8 billion–$70.7 billion) from 1996 through 2013. 
Spending on prescribed retail pharmaceuticals increased the most, especially from 2009 
through 2013. Diabetes spending on ambulatory care also increased substantially.
Federal Government Public Health Spending
In 2013, 23.8% (UI, 20.6%–27.3%) of government public health spending was provided by 
the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the US 
Food and Drug Administration. Some of these resources were spent via federally run 
programs, whereas some of the spending was used to finance public health programs run by 
state and local governments. Table 4 reports estimated spending on the 20 conditions with 
the most public health spending. HIV/AIDS was estimated to be the condition in 2013 with

 the most federal public health spending, with an estimated $3.5 billion (UI, $3.3billion–
$4.3billion) spent in 2013. The second-largest and third-largest conditions of federal public 
health spending in 2013 were estimated to be lower respiratory tract infections and diarrheal 
diseases, with an estimated $1.8 billion (UI, $1.2 billion–$2.1 billion) and $0.9 billion (UI, 
$0.7 billion–$1.0 billion) spent, respectively.
Discussion
This research estimated personal health care spending from 1996 through 2013 for 155 
conditions, 6 types of health care, and 38 age and sex categories using a standardized set of 
methods that adjusted for data imperfections. In addition, federal public health spending 
from 4 US agencies was disaggregated by condition, age and sex group, and type of care. 
Across all age and sex groups and types of care, diabetes, IHD, and low back and neck pain 
accounted for the highest amounts of health care spending in 2013. Personal health care 
spending increased for 143 of the 155 conditions from 1996 through 2013. Spending on low 
back and neck pain and on diabetes increased the most over the 18 years. From 1996 
through 2013, spending on emergency care and pharmaceuticals increased at the fastest 
rates, which were higher than annual rates for spending on inpatient care and nursing facility 
care.
Personal Health Care Conditions With Highest Spending
The conditions with highest health care spending in 2013 were a diverse group, with distinct 
patterns across age and sex, type of care, and time. Some of the top 20 conditions of health 
care spending in 2013 were chronic diseases with relatively high disease prevalence and 
health burden.6 These conditions included diabetes, IHD, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, and cerebrovascular disease, all of which have an underlying health burden nearly 
exclusively attributable to modifiable risk factors. For example, diabetes was 100% 
attributed to behavioral or metabolic risk factors that included diet, obesity, high fasting 
plasma glucose, tobacco use, and low physical activity. Similarly, IHD, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and cerebrovascular disease each have more than 78% of their disease 
burden attributable to similar risks.24 Cancer was not included in the leading causes of 
spending because it was disaggregated into 29 conditions.
In addition to the chronic diseases mentioned above, a varied set of diseases, injuries, and 
risk factors composed the list of top 20 conditions causing health care spending. Many 
disorders related to pain were among these conditions, including low back and neck pain, 
osteoarthritis, other musculoskeletal disorders, and some neurological disorders associated 
with pain syndromes and muscular dystrophy. Unlike the 4 chronic conditions already 
mentioned, spending on these pain-related conditions was highest for working-age adults. 
Low back and neck pain, which also accounts for a sizable health burden in the United 
States, was the third-largest condition of spending in 2013 and one of the conditions for 
which spending increased the most from 1996 through 2013.6
The treatment of 2 risk factors, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, were also among the top 
20 conditions incurring spending. Spending for these conditions has collectively increased at 
more than double the rate of total health spending, and together led to an estimated $135.7

 billion (UI, $131.1 billion–$142.1 billion) in spending in 2013. Although a great deal of 
health burden is attributable to obesity and tobacco, the treatment of these 2 risk factors was 
not among the top 20 conditions of spending. Growth rates on spending for both of these 
risk factors were comparable with growth rates on spending for hypertension and 
hyperlipidemia, but these 2 risk factors had much less spending in 1996, and consequently 
continued to have much less spending in 2013.
Other disorders among the top 20 conditions accounting for health care spending were 
injuries resulting from falls and depressive disorders. Falls was the only injury on the top 20 
list. Similarly, depressive disorders was the only mental health condition on the list, although 
when combined with other mental health and substance abuse conditions, this aggregated 
category became one of the largest aggregated categories of health care spending (Figure 1). 
There was also a large amount of health care spending for skin disorders, which included 
acne and eczema; sense disorders, which included vision correction and adult hearing loss; 2 
conditions of spending related to dental care; and urinary diseases, which included male 
infertility, urinary tract infections, and cyst of the kidney. Health care spending on pregnancy 
and postpartum care was restricted to spending on healthy pregnancy, and excluded costs 
associated with maternal or neonatal complications, or well-newborn care. Pregnancy and 
postpartum care was the tenth-largest condition of spending. When combined with well-
newborn care, this aggregated category was estimated to compose $83.5 billion (UI, $78.3 
billion–$89.5 billion) of spending and accounted for the fifth-highest amount of US health 
care spending. Lower respiratory tract infection was the condition with the 20th-highest 
amount of spending, and Alzheimer disease had the 21st-highest amount. Although 
Alzheimer disease is often the focus of attention due to concerns about accelerated spending 
growth, this condition has had relatively minor growth (an estimated 1.9% [UI, 0.7%–3.2%]) 
from 1996 through 2013.
Conditions With the Highest Annual Increases in Personal Health Care Spending
In addition to highlighting conditions with large amounts of spending, this research also 
traced spending growth over time and identified the largest categories of spending growth. 
From 1996 through 2013, personal health care spending occurring in the 6 types of care 
tracked in this study increased by an estimated $933.5 billion. The conditions for which 
spending increased the most were diabetes, low back and neck pain, hypertension, and 
hyperlipidemia (Figure 5). Across all conditions, spending on prescribed retail 
pharmaceuticals increased at an annualized rate of 5.6% from 1996 through 2013. Of the 6 
types of personal health care, only spending in emergency departments grew faster (6.4% 
annually), whereas the share of health care spending for inpatient hospitals and nursing 
facilities actually decreased. Although spending on prescribed retail pharmaceuticals and 
emergency department care increased at the fastest rates, the majority of the increase in 
spending occurred where spending was already concentrated—in ambulatory and inpatient 
care. Spending for these 2 types of care, which increased by an estimated $324.9 billion and 
$259.2 billion, respectively, from 1996 through 2013, remained higher than all other types of 
care.

 Spending on Those 65 Years and Older
Because of the aging US population and political concerns about the financing of Medicare, 
there is increasing interest in health care spending on the oldest age groups. An estimated 
37.9% (UI, 37.6%–38.2%) of personal health care spending was for those 65 years and older 
in 2013. Spending per person was greatest in the oldest age group, reaching an estimated 
$24 160 (UI, $23 149–$25 270) per man and $24 047 (UI, $23 551–$24 650) per woman. 
For those 65 years and older, 36.8% (UI, 36.2%–37.2%) of spending was in inpatient 
hospitals and 21.7% (UI, 21.4%–21.9%) was in nursing facility care, and the largest 
conditions of health care spending were estimated to be IHD, hypertension, and diabetes.
Comparing Personal Health Care Spending and Public Health Spending
In addition to estimating personal health spending, this study disaggregated public health 
spending from 4 federal agencies by condition and age and sex group. Prior to this research, 
studies of government public health programs were primarily focused on state and local 
programs. Disaggregating federal public health spending shows a focus on a variety of 
conditions and ages. Top conditions include infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, lower 
respiratory tract infections, and diarrheal diseases. This list is different from the list in 
personal health care spending, where noncommunicable diseases comprise the majority of 
the spending. Although public health initiatives, such as screening, immunizations, health 
behavior interventions, and surveillance programs have been shown to be cost-effective, 
public health spending remains very small compared with personal health spending; in 2013, 
total government public health spending amounted to an estimated $77.9 billion, or about 
2.8% of total health spending.
Comparison With Existing Literature
This research differs from cost of illness studies that measure spending for a single or small 
set of conditions, as this research used a comprehensive set of conditions and the total 
amount of spending attributed to these conditions reflects official US personal health 
spending estimates.25–27 Because of the comprehensive nature of this project, spending 
estimation was protected from the double counting that can occur in other cost-of-illness 
studies, in which the same spending may be attributed to multiple conditions.7
Although distinct from most cost-of-illness studies, this research was most similar to 
previous research by Thorpe and colleagues,5,12,28–30 who have each published work 
disaggregating health care spending by condition or age and sex groups. Previous research 
disaggregating spending by conditions showed that mental conditions and cardiovascular 
diseases accounted for the greatest amount of spending,5,12 and that spending on different 
conditions was changing at different rates from 2000 through 2010.29 Additionally, previous 
research disaggregating spending by age and sex groups showed that female spending per 
person was greater than male spending per person, and spending per person on those 65 
years and older was 5 times as much as spending on those 18 years and younger.30 Although 
the condition list and age groups used in these other projects did not perfectly align with the 
mapping used in this study, the findings presented here are consistent with these previous 
findings. Results from this study estimated that in 2013 cardiovascular diseases and mental 
disorders were the largest aggregate condition categories accounting for health care

 spending, particularly when Alzheimer disease was included with other mental disorders as 
it was in these other studies. Similarly, this research confirms that spending per capita 
among persons 65 years and older was substantially more than spending on the other age 
groups, and particularly greater than that spent on children younger than 20 years. This 
study also shows that spending per person on males was generally less than spending on 
females.
However, the present study contains information and methodological improvements that 
were lacking in existing studies. The present study added to this literature by disaggregating 
spending at a more granular level. The condition categories used to disaggregate personal 
spending span 155 conditions, whereas previous studies used larger, more aggregated 
categories based on ICD-9 chapters. More importantly, the present study disaggregated 
personal health care spending simultaneously by condition, age and sex group, and type of 
care. Simultaneous disaggregation allows researchers and policy makers to focus more 
precisely on which conditions had increased spending, as well as on the ages and types of 
care where growth in health care spending is most acute. In addition to this more granular 
disaggregation, spending estimates for this study were adjusted to account for comorbidities.
Limitations
This research had 4 categories of limitations, all caused by imperfect data. The first category 
of limitations was technical and occurred because a high-quality census of US health care 
spending was not available. This problem manifests in several specific problems, all of 
which require modeling and at-time assumptions that may not be tenable. First, scaling of 
the estimates to reflect total US health care spending relied upon the assumption that the 
population-weighted data were representative of total national spending. As has been 
pointed out elsewhere, this scaling may be biased because some populations—such as 
incarcerated persons, those receiving care from Veterans Affairs facilities, or those serving 
on active military duty—were not represented in the raw data.31,32 These groups were 
estimated to together make up less than 3% of total health care spending.5 Second, health 
system encounters with exceedingly high health care spending, may not be captured fully in 
survey data.33 Third, imprecise ICD-9 codes that could not be directly mapped to a health 
condition required additional modeling and spending redistribution. Fourth, charge data 
were used for estimation of spending in inpatient care and nursing facility care. Inpatient 
care charges were adjusted using statistical methods and charge to payment ratios measured 
using an additional data source, but nursing facility care charges were assumed to reflect 
spending patterns. If the charge to payment ratios in nursing facility care vary by condition, 
this assumption will have biased the results. Fifth, this study made spending estimates at a 
very granular level. In some cases, a small number of cases were used as a basis for 
estimation.
In all of these cases, multiple data sources were leveraged and statistical smoothing was used 
to correct potential biases. Although these methods were applied consistently across all data 
sources and UIs were calculated for all estimates, a diverse set of assumptions and 
simplifications were necessary. In some cases, these assumptions may not be accurate and 
may bias the results. Statistical estimation and adjustments should never replace an effort to

 collect more specific, complete, and publicly available health care data. Given the size and 
complexity of the US health care system, additional resources are needed to improve patient-
level resource tracking across time and types of care.
The second category of limitation was related to the quantification of uncertainty. This study 
relied on empirical bootstrapping to approximate UIs but these calculations depend on 
important assumptions that may not hold at the most granular reporting levels. Furthermore, 
these methods were not calibrated to reflect a precise range of confidence and do not 
account for all types of uncertainty. Thus, the reported UIs should be interpreted as relative 
measures of uncertainty, used to compare the uncertainty across the large set of spending 
estimates.
The third category of limitations was related to unavailable data. In particular, a critical mass 
of data did not provide information with spending stratified by geographic area, patient race, 
or socioeconomic status. In addition to this, the most granular GBD condition taxonomy was 
not used for this study, because at that level of granularity, the underlying data were too 
sparse to enable resource tracking. Similarly, these estimates extend only to 2013, rather 
than through the present because more recent data were not sufficiently available. From a 
policy perspective, these important demographic, socioeconomic, geographic, and 
epidemiological distinctions could motivate and inform necessary health system 
improvements, and warrant further research.
The fourth category of limitations was related to public health spending data availability. 
The fragmentation of the US public health system and lack of a comprehensive data source 
prevented a disaggregation of total government public health spending, and forced this study 
to focus exclusively on resources channeled through 4 federal agencies. These agencies 
make up only 23.8% (UI, 20.6%–27.3%) of total government public health spending. This 
research was included in this study as a valuable description to juxtapose the foci of public 
health spending and personal health spending and to highlight the need for ongoing research 
assessing public health spending.
Conclusions
Modeled estimates of US spending on personal health care and public health showed 
substantial increases from 1996 through 2013; with spending on diabetes, IHD, and low 
back and neck pain accounting for the highest amounts of spending by disease category. The 
rate of change in annual spending varied considerably among different conditions and types 
of care. This information may have implications for efforts to control US health care 
spending.
