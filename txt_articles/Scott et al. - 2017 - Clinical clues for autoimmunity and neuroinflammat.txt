AIM Autistic regression is a unique variant within the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs),
with recent reports raising the possibility of immune aetiology. This study explores clinical
clues for an association between autistic regression and autoimmunity.
METHOD Single-centre charts of children diagnosed with ASD in 2014 were reviewed. We
compared the rates of: (1) familial autoimmunity in first-degree and second-degree relatives; (2)
febrile illness preceding initial parental concern, as a potential precipitant of immune activation;
and (3) possible non-immune precipitants such as pregnancy and postnatal complications.
RESULTS The charts of 206 children with ASD and 33 diagnosed with autistic regression
variant were reviewed. The incidence of febrile illness in the 6 months prior to initial parental
concern was significantly higher in the children with autistic regression compared with those
with ASD (30% vs 0%; p<0.001). The overall prevalence of familial autoimmunity was also
higher in children with autistic regression compared with those with ASD (33% vs 12%;
p<0.001). Type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroiditis were both more common in families
with children with autistic regression. Other non-immune risk factors did not differ between
the two groups.
INTERPRETATION Our findings suggest that predisposition to autoimmunity, and immune/
inflammatory activation, may be associated with autistic regression.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represent an array of neu-
rodevelopmental entities of varying severities. Diagnostic
criteria include impairments in social, cognitive, and com-
munication skills, stereotypical and repetitive behaviours,
and restricted areas of interest.1 The majority of patients
present with ongoing developmental delay that begins at
infancy; however, up to a third of patients demonstrate
regression and loss of milestones between 18 months and
24 months of age.2 The latter variant is known as autistic
regression.
The autistic regression variant is poorly understood, and
its aetiology may differ from that of ASD. In search of possi-
ble precipitants, some reports suggested early neonatal
insults, prematurity, or seizures as possible culprits;3,4
however, others have not been able to confirm such an
association.5,6 One emerging theory suggests that immune
dysregulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of some
cases of autistic regression.7,8 Impetus for this theory origi-
nates in the field of psychiatry, demonstrating the presence
of serum antineuronal antibodies in patients with acute psy-
chiatric presentations.9 With regard to autistic regression,
some reports have documented development of autistic
regression in the context of the autoimmune anti-N-methyl-
D-aspartate
receptor
(anti-NMDAR)
encephalitis.10,11
Another case study reported on autistic language regression
in the context of autoimmune proliferative syndrome; the
patient responded remarkably to corticosteroid treatment.12
This aim of this chart review study was to further
explore the relationship between autoimmunity and autistic
regression. Our research questions were as follows: (1) Is
the prevalence of familial autoimmunity different between
patients with autistic regression and those with ASD? (2)
Given the role of infectious pathogens in autoimmune acti-
vation,13 is a preceding febrile illness more common in
autistic regression compared with ASD?
A comparison of other previously suggested precipitants,
including pregnancy and perinatal complications, was also
performed.
METHOD
Patients
This study was conducted at the Glenrose Rehabilitation
Hospital, University of Alberta. The study was approved
by the University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board,
and adhered to all of the committee’s recommendations.
Charts of all patients diagnosed with ASD in 2014 were
reviewed for possible inclusion in the study. The criteria
for inclusion in the study were an ASD diagnosis made in

 2014, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria,1 as well
as medical files containing a completed parental question-
naire, administered to all new patients in our clinic prior
to first visit, and a full physician assessment. Exclusion cri-
teria included a history of any known genetic syndromes,
seizure disorders, movement disorders, congenital anoma-
lies, or a history of any acquired brain injury, resulting
from trauma, stroke, or meningitis. Exclusion of children
with known genetic conditions and inborn errors of meta-
bolism was done, because some of these have a known
association with regression, which may have served as a
confounding factor, impeding our ability to interpret the
study results.
Diagnosis of autistic regression was determined based on
the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised criteria,14 which
stipulate onset of developmental regression prior to 3 years
of
age.
A
developmental
regression
must
have
been
observed by parents in at least one of the following
domains,
according
to
Autism
Diagnostic
Interview-
Revised: (1) speech and language development; (2) social
interaction and play skills (pointing to express interest, eye
contact, use of gestures such as wave ‘goodbye’ or blow a
kiss, facial expressions used to communicate, social smiling,
showing and directing attention, offering to share, ability
for reciprocal conversation, imitative social play, interest,
and interaction with other children); (3) fine motor skills
related to purposeful hand movements (ability to hold and
grip, self-feed, self-dress, and drawing); or (4) gross motor
skills. The developmental milestone must have been main-
tained for at least 3 months, followed by loss of skill for at
least 3 months.14
Diagnosis of ASD was determined based on DSM-V cri-
teria.1 Children included in the ASD group had demon-
strated
core,
persistent
deficits
in
their
social
or
communication skills, and exhibited behavioural descriptors
that were atypical for age since early infancy. These chil-
dren were never reported as typically developing according
to parental report, medical records, and health care profes-
sionals’ reports.
Data collection
Following identification of charts to be included in the
study, each chart was assigned a number and all names
were
removed.
The
anonymized
charts
were
then
separately reviewed by a member of the study team who
was not familiar with the patients, for purposes of data
extraction.
The following information was gathered from patient
charts: (1) sex; (2) ASD versus autistic regression; (3) preg-
nancy complications (maternal hypertension, infections,
teratogen exposure, gestational diabetes, or other maternal
illness); (4) gestational age at birth (term or preterm); (5)
mode of delivery: spontaneous vaginal delivery versus other
(forceps/vacuum-assisted, or Caesarean section); and (6)
immediate postnatal complications, such as oxygen require-
ment
or
neonatal
intensive
care
unit
stay.
We
also
collected information about any preceding febrile illness in
the 6-month period prior to first parental concern. The
family history data collected included any known first-
degree
or
second-degree
relatives
with
the
following
autoimmune
conditions:
autoimmune
thyroid
disease
(Graves or Hashimoto thyroiditis), type 1 diabetes mellitus,
rheumatoid arthritis, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel
disease (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis), and psoriasis.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of extracted anonymized data was per-
formed by an analyst who was not a member of the study
team. Analysis was done using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA) and R version 3.1.3 (IBM, Stanford,
CA, USA). Patients were grouped according to diagnosis
(autistic regression vs ASD) and the data were summarized
for each group (e.g. frequencies, percentages, and means
with standard deviations [SDs]). A two-sample z-test was
used to compare the incidence of various autoimmune dis-
eases in participants’ family histories. v2 tests were used to
compare groups in terms of sex, preceding febrile illness,
pregnancy complications, delivery, gestational age at birth,
and the existence of postnatal complications. Normality
assumption was verified for all parametric analyses.
Logistic regression models were fitted, adjusting for sex
and the presence of preceding illnesses, to predict how a
patient’s family history of autoimmune diseases affected
the odds of the patient having autistic regression rather
than ASD. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) are reported.
Causal mediation analyses were performed using the
‘mediation’ package in R and implementing the Baron and
Kenny method,15 to investigate whether the association
between autistic regression and the odds of having a family
history of autoimmune diseases was mediated by preceding
febrile illnesses. The effect of the potential mediator on
the estimated OR was examined by including the mediator
in the logistic regression model and observing the change
in the estimated OR. Then, the proportion of the total
effect size mediated by the mediator was tested for statisti-
cal significance. In all statistical tests, p<0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
RESULTS
The charts of 299 patients diagnosed with ASD in 2014
were reviewed. Of those, 37 were excluded owing to chart
incompleteness and 23 patient charts were excluded owing
to previously diagnosed genetic disorders or congenital

 anomalies. Of the 239 patients included in the study, 206
(86.2%) had ASD and 33 (13.8%) were diagnosed with
autistic regression variant. The sex ratio was similar in
both groups: eight patients (24.2%) in the autistic regres-
sion group were female versus 58 (28.2%) in the ASD
group (see Table I). All the children in the autistic regres-
sion group had sudden acute deterioration without fluctua-
tions or a plateau. Regression data regarding specific
domains of initial concern are provided in Table II.
The proportion of pregnancy complications, prematu-
rity, modes of delivery other than spontaneous vaginal
delivery, and postnatal complications were not significantly
different between the two groups. The incidence of a pre-
ceding febrile illnesses differed significantly between the
groups: the parents of 10 patients (30.3%) in the autistic
regression group reported a febrile illness in the 6 months
prior to first concern versus none reported (0%) in the
ASD group (p<0.001; Table I). Testing for serum anti-
NMDAR antibodies had been performed in three of the
children with autistic regression, all of whom had negative
results. Neuronal antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid had
not been measured for any of the patients.
With respect to family history, the autistic regression
group had a significantly higher proportion of patients
with first-degree or second-degree relatives who had an
autoimmune
condition
(11
[33.3%]
vs
24
[11.7%];
p=0.003). When examining the prevalence of maternal
autoimmunity in particular, eight out of 33 (24.2%) chil-
dren in the autistic regression group had a mother with an
autoimmune condition versus seven out of 206 in the ASD
group (3.4%) who had an affected mother (p<0.001). None
of the patients in either group had any siblings with ASD.
Regarding
specific
conditions,
patients
with
autistic
regression had a significantly higher number of relatives
with autoimmune thyroid disease (8 [24.2%] vs 17 [8.3%];
p=0.011) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (4 [12.1%] vs 3
[1.5%]; p=0.008). The proportion of familial coeliac disease
(1 [3.0%] vs 0 [0%]; p=0.138), rheumatoid arthritis (2
[6.1%] vs 3 [1.5%]; p=0.142), psoriasis (1 [3.0%] vs
2 [1.0%]; p=0.361), and inflammatory bowel disease (2
[6.1%] vs 2 [1.0%]; p=0.093) did not differ significantly
between the groups (Table I). Of note, seven patients in
the autistic regression group and three patients in the ASD
group had family members who had two autoimmune
conditions.
When stratifying the family history by sex, of the 35
patients with family histories of autoimmune diseases, five
(14.3%) were female and 30 (85.7%) were male; however,
sex was not associated with family history of autoimmune
diseases (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.15–1.06). The sex ratio for
family history of autoimmunity was similar in the two
groups: nine of the 11 patients in the autistic regression
group with a family history of autoimmunity were male
(81.8%) versus 20 male patients out of the 24 (83.3%) in
the ASD group.
The results from fitting bivariate models indicate signifi-
cant associations between autistic regression and the odds
of a family history of autoimmunity (OR 3.79, 95% CI
1.64–8.78) and the odds of a preceding febrile illnesses
(OR 6.07, 95% CI 2.79–13.21). After adjusting for sex,
autistic regression was found to be significantly associated
with the odds of having a family history of autoimmunity
(adjusted OR 3.78, 95% CI 1.61–8.83), as well as having a
preceding
febrile illness (adjusted OR 6.12, 95% CI
2.81–13.33).

 regression and family history of autoimmunity was medi-
ated by the preceding febrile illness. After adjusting for the
presence of a preceding febrile illness, the estimated OR
increased from 3.78 (95% CI 1.61–8.83) to 4.43 (95% CI
1.75–11.24). Hence, the indirect influence of preceding
febrile illness on the association between autistic regression
and a history of family autoimmunity was 2%, which was
not statistically significant (p=0.840).
DISCUSSION
Autistic regression is a unique variant of ASD, postulated
to involve immune dysregulation.7,8 Our study demon-
strated that children with autistic regression differ from
those with ASD with respect to family history of autoim-
munity – and, in particular, maternal autoimmunity – and
occurrence of a febrile illness in the 6 months prior to first
concern. Sex ratios, as well as complications of pregnancy,
delivery, and early postnatal life, did not differ significantly
between the two groups.
The possibility of immune involvement in ASD has been
previously raised. Indeed, a number of studies report on
altered profiles of inflammatory markers, cytokines, and
immunoglobulins in the sera of patients with ASD.16,17
Moreover, immune-mediated conditions are known to be
more prevalent in people with ASD and their unaffected
family members than in the general population.18 Never-
theless, to date, no specific or consistent pattern has been
established. This may be owing to the heterogeneity of
ASD, suggesting the need to explore separately various
subgroups within the ASD population.7,19
Recently, a study by Molloy et al.19 demonstrated a
link between autistic regression and familial autoimmune
thyroid
disease.
Further,
our
study
found
an
overall
higher
prevalence
of
familial
autoimmunity
among
patients with autistic regression than in patients in the
ASD
group.
Conditions
that
were
significantly
more
prevalent in families of children with autistic regression
included type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid
disease. Our study also found a higher prevalence of
maternal autoimmunity in the autistic regression group.
The notion of maternal autoimmunity as contributing to
neurodevelopmental disability has been previously pro-
posed. Dalton et al.20 isolated neuronal autoantibodies
from the serum of a mother of three children, of whom
one had ASD and another had severe language delay.
When injecting these antibodies in pregnant mice, the
investigators reported alterations in fetal brain develop-
ment, whereas the dams remained asymptomatic.20 More
recently, a large cohort study involving mothers of chil-
dren with ASD demonstrated a higher prevalence of
brain-reactive autoantibodies than unselected females of
child-bearing age.21 Finally, a study by Vinet et al.22
recently found a higher incidence of ASD in children
born to mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus than
in those born to females without this condition. Interest-
ingly, none of our study participants in either group had
siblings affected by ASD, suggesting that even if maternal
autoimmunity is a contributor, other factors may play a
role in development of ASD.
The incidence of a febrile illness in the 6 months prior
to first concern was significantly higher in the autistic
regression group than in the ASD group. As infectious
pathogens are thought to be major environmental triggers
of autoimmune activation,13 this finding may suggest an
inflammatory or immune pathology underlying the devel-
opment of autistic regression in some patients. Interest-
ingly, our causal mediation
analysis showed that the
association between autistic regression and family history
of autoimmunity was not significantly mediated by the
presence of a preceding febrile illness.
When examining the role of possible non-immunologi-
cal precipitants, our study found no difference between
the groups with respect to pregnancy and delivery com-
plications, neonatal need for oxygen support, or neonatal
intensive care unit stay. This is in keeping with previous
studies, which did not find an association between autis-
tic regression and various obstetrical and neonatal risk
factors.5,6
The notion of autoimmune and inflammatory pathology
in autistic regression is of particular interest when consid-
ering potential immune-modulatory interventions. A num-
ber of reports have already documented improvement in
various developmental parameters in patients with autistic
regression
following
treatment
with
corticosteroids.8,23
Less evidence is currently available for the use of intra-
venous immunoglobulin; studies in patients with ASD
show improvement in autistic features in some participants
treated with intravenous immunoglobulin.24,25 However,
these studies were characterized by heterogenic patient
populations with respect to autism subgroup (autistic
regression vs ASD). More recently, reports of three chil-
dren with anti-NMDAR receptor encephalitis and autistic
regression demonstrated significant symptom amelioration
with intravenous immunoglobulin; however, these cases
were marked by associated neurological symptomatology,
including seizures and movement disorders.10,11 It would
be interesting to investigate whether the use of immune-
modulatory interventions in children with autistic regres-
sion shortly after the onset of symptoms is beneficial in
ameliorating autistic features, outside of the context of
anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
Some limitations of our study include the small sample
size of patients with autistic regression, owing to the rela-
tively smaller proportion of this subgroup within the ASD
patient population diagnosed in 2014. Another limitation is
that information regarding preceding febrile illness, as well
as regression of milestones, was based solely on parental
recall, and not directly observed by clinicians. These limi-
tations call for careful interpretation of the study results, as
the notion of regression as a whole is still a subject of
debate in the literature. Certainly, more extensive data will
be
needed
in
order
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
immunotherapy
in
the
context
of
autistic
regression.
Finally,

 comparisons issue; for example, when breaking down com-
parison of familial autoimmunity into a set of separate
comparisons for each condition. However, given that the
presence of one autoimmune condition may not be inde-
pendent from another (as is evident by some family
members with more than one autoimmune condition),
performing a correction is challenging in this case. Inter-
pretation of our analysis should therefore be done with
caution.
Follow-up
studies
in
the
form
of
whole
genome
sequencing may be warranted to further elucidate whether
a particular genetic factor underlies susceptibility to autis-
tic regression.
CONCLUSION
Patients with autistic regression represent a unique sub-
group within the spectrum of autistic disorders. Our study
shows higher familial incidence of autoimmunity, in partic-
ular maternal autoimmunity, and increased incidence of
febrile illness in autistic regression. These findings may
help further define the specific features of autistic regres-
sion, suggesting possible directions for research into both
pathophysiology and treatment of this intriguing entity.
