BACKGROUND
Recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (cerliponase alfa) is an enzyme- 
replacement therapy that has been developed to treat neuronal ceroid lipofusci-
nosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, a rare lysosomal disorder that causes progressive 
dementia in children.
METHODS
In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of intraventricular infu-
sion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with CLN2 disease who were 
between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was initiated at a dose of 30 mg, 
100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received the 300-mg dose for at least 
96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a 2-point decline in the score 
on the motor and language domains of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale (which 
ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 representing no function and 3 representing normal 
function in each of the two domains), which was compared with the rate of decline 
in 42 historical controls. We also compared the rate of decline in the motor– 
language score between the two groups, using data from baseline to the last 
assessment with a score of more than 0, divided by the length of follow-up (in units 
of 48 weeks).
RESULTS
Twenty-four patients were enrolled, 23 of whom constituted the efficacy popula-
tion. The median time until a 2-point decline in the motor–language score was not 
reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls. The mean 
(±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor–language score per 48-week period 
was 0.27±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12±0.98 points in 42 historical 
controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events included con-
vulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure of the intraven-
tricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the intraventricular device 
that was used to administer the infusion, which required antibiotic treatment and 
device replacement.
CONCLUSIONS
Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 disease resulted 
in less decline in motor and language function than that in historical controls. 
Serious adverse events included failure of the intraventricular device and device-
related infections. (Funded by BioMarin Pharmaceutical and others; CLN2 
ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01907087 and NCT02485899.)

N
euronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 
type 2 (CLN2) disease, a form of Batten’s 
disease, is a rare, autosomal recessive, 
pediatric neurodegenerative disease resulting from 
pathogenic variants in the gene encoding lyso-
somal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1).1,2 A 
deficiency of TPP1 results in accumulation of lyso-
somal storage material that causes degenerative 
changes in neurons throughout the central nervous 
system and retina.3 Affected children are function-
ally normal until the age of 2 to 4 years and sub-
sequently have seizures and delayed language 
acquisition followed by a rapid decline in motor, 
language, cognitive, and visual function over a 
period of 4 to 6 years and death by early adoles-
cence.4,5 There has been no approved therapy for 
this disorder.
Natural-history cohorts of children with 
CLN2 disease have shown progressive decline 
in motor and language function.6-8 A database 
of children with the disease has characterized 
disease severity and progression with a disease-
specific clinical rating scale, including motor, 
language, and visual function, and incorpo-
rates the frequency of grand mal seizures.9 
Specific disease genotypes do not consistent-
ly correlate with phenotype, although patho-
logic variants other than the two most com-
mon ones (c.622C→T nonsense mutation and 
c.509-1G→C splice defect) may be associated 
with an increased probability of a later onset 
of the disease.10
Cerliponase alfa, a recombinant proenzyme 
(also called zymogen) form of human TPP1, is 
an enzyme-replacement therapy that has poten-
tial use in patients with CLN2 disease. The 
administration of enzyme into the ventricular 
cerebrospinal fluid of young dogs that were 
spontaneously homozygous for TPP1 deficiency 
resulted in widespread distribution and uptake 
in the brain, clearance of lysosomal storage 
material, preservation of neuronal morphologic 
features, and a reduction in brain inflamma-
tion.11,12 The treated dogs also had delayed on-
set and slower progression of neurologic signs 
and brain atrophy, preserved cognitive function, 
and an extended life span in a dose-dependent 
manner.11,13,14 These findings led to this clinical 
study of recombinant human TPP1 administered 
by intraventricular infusion in children with CLN2 
disease.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
We performed the open-label study from Septem-
ber 2013 through November 2015 at five centers 
(one each in Germany, Italy, and the United 
States and two in the United Kingdom) to assess 
the efficacy and safety of intraventricular cerli-
ponase alfa in children with CLN2 disease. Writ-
ten informed consent from a parent or legal 
guardian of each patient was obtained, and as-
sent was obtained from the patient, if appropri-
ate. The studies were performed in accordance 
with the provisions of the Declaration of Hel-
sinki. The study protocol was approved by the 
relevant ethics boards and is available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org.
The study was designed and funded and data 
were analyzed by the sponsor, BioMarin Pharma-
ceutical. Assistance with manuscript preparation 
was provided by a medical writer who was paid 
by the sponsor, with review by the authors. All 
the authors vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the study results, adherence to the 
protocol, and reporting of adverse events.
Study Patients
Eligible patients were between the ages of 3 and 
16 years and had received a diagnosis of CLN2 
disease. All the patients had a combined score of 
3 to 6 on the motor and language domains of 
the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale (which ranges 
from 0 to 6, with 0 representing no function and 
3 representing normal function for each of the 
two domains)6,7 (Fig. 1) and a score of at least 
1 in each of the two domains at screening. Ex-
clusion criteria included the presence of another 
inherited neurologic disease or illness that might 
have caused cognitive decline; previous stem-cell 
therapy, gene therapy, or enzyme-replacement 
therapy for CLN2 disease; contraindications for 
neurosurgery or for magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI); generalized motor status epilepticus 
or severe infection within 4 weeks before the 
initiation of treatment; and known hypersensi-
tivity to any component of the study drug. Patients 
were referred to study centers by their diagnos-
ing physicians; all the patients who were screened 
for eligibility were enrolled.

label study with a score of more than 0 on the

Intraventricular Cerliponase Alfa for CLN2 Disease
CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale were eligible to 
enroll in a 240-week extension study of 300 mg 
of intraventricular cerliponase alfa adminis-
tered every 2 weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT02485899). Data from the extension study 
through November 1, 2016, are included in this 
report.
Patients who were enrolled in the Dementia 
in Childhood database, which includes children 
in whom CLN2 disease has been diagnosed in 
Hamburg, Germany, and Verona, Italy,9 served 
as a historical control group. (Details regarding 
the inclusion criteria for the historical control 
group are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available at NEJM.org.)
Treatment
An Ommaya or Rickham ventricular reservoir was 
surgically implanted, with the reservoir placed 
under the scalp and the catheter placed in the 
cerebral lateral ventricle in each patient, with 
placement confirmed on MRI. Cerliponase alfa 
was administered by means of intraventricular 
infusion at a rate of 2.5 ml per hour for 4 hours. 
An antihistamine drug was administered approxi-
mately 30 minutes before each infusion.
We conducted a dose-escalation phase in which 
the study drug was initiated at 30 mg, 100 mg, 
or 300 mg every 2 weeks, a regimen that was 
intended to establish an acceptable side-effect 
profile. During the dose-escalation phase, patients 
received at least two infusions at each dose level; 
3 patients who started at 30 mg received two to 
six doses, 3 patients who started at 100 mg re-
ceived two to five doses, and 4 patients who 
started at 300 mg received one to three doses. 
This phase was followed by a 48-week period 
in which the patients received a stable dose of 
300 mg every 2 weeks. Details regarding the 
study design are provided in Figure S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
At the parents’ request, one patient dropped 
out of the study after the receipt of one dose of 
the study drug owing to an unwillingness to 
continue with study visits and procedures; this 
patient was not included in the efficacy analysis 
but was included in the safety analysis. A data 
and safety monitoring committee approved the 
dose escalations. (Details are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Outcome Measures
The primary efficacy outcome was the time until 
the first unreversed 2-point decline in the score 
on the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale measuring 
motor and language skills or until the attain-
ment of a combined motor–language score of 0, 
as compared with the time in the historical con-
trol group. The same analysis was performed for 
the language score and motor score individually. 
The performance was assessed over a period of 
at least 96 weeks during which patients received 
the 300-mg dose of cerliponase alfa in both the 
primary and the extension studies. We also com-
pared the absolute scores with those in matched 
historical controls, along with scores on an 
extended CLN2 scale in four domains — motor 
skills, language, vision, and seizure — that 
Figure 1. Scoring for Motor and Language Function on the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale.
The primary end point of the study was an aggregate score in the domains for motor and language function on the 
CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale. Each domain is scored from 0 (no function) to 3 (normal function) for a maximal possi-
ble score of 6 for the two domains.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
ranges from 0 to 12, with 0 indicating no func-
tion and 3 representing normal function in each 
of the four domains (Table S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Trained raters administered the clinical rat-
ing scales in a standardized manner. Brain gray-
matter volumes were measured with the use of 
high-resolution MRI. Data regarding adverse 
events and concomitant medications were re-
ported at every visit. The attribution of adverse 
events to cerliponase alfa were determined by 
the site investigator and were not adjudicated. 
(Details regarding these data, including the tim-
ing of visits during the infusion, dose escalation, 
and stable dose periods, are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.)
Statistical Analysis
All the patients who had received more than one 
dose of cerliponase alfa were included in all the 
efficacy analyses. Study patients were compared 
with a historical control group of 42 patients, 
who were selected from 69 patients in the CLN2 
database after the exclusion of 27 patients (1 twin 
of a historical control, 7 patients who later en-
rolled in the treatment study, 17 patients who 
lacked sufficient data regarding scores on the 
motor and language scale, and 2 patients who 
did not meet clinical criteria) (see the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The baseline measurement 
was the last observation preceding the first 
administration of 300 mg of cerliponase alfa. 
Safety results are relative to the last observation 
preceding device implantation. Among patients 
in the historical control cohort, baseline scores 
on the motor and language scale were defined 
as the first score of less than 6 at the age of 36 
months or more; the baseline age of assessment 
was the midpoint of the age range of assess-
ments at the time this score was obtained.
For the primary efficacy outcome, we calcu-
lated the rate of decline in the motor–language 
score as the change from baseline to the last 
assessment with a score of more than 0, divided 
by the length of follow-up (in units of 48 weeks). 
The mean rate of decline on the motor–language 
score was compared with the use of a two-
sample t-test with Satterthwaite’s approximation 
to accommodate unequal variances and was es-
timated by analysis of covariance after adjust-
ment for baseline variables (motor–language 
score, age, genotype, and sex). We used Kaplan–
Meier methods and a Cox proportional-hazards 
model to compare the time until the primary 
outcome, after adjustment for the baseline motor–
language score, motor score alone, language 
score alone, age, genotype, and sex.
We compared the change from baseline in 
the total CLN2 score on the four-domain scale 
(range, 0 to 12) between treated patients and 
1:1 matched patients in the historical control 
group who had the closest values with respect to 
the baseline motor–language score, age (within 
3 months), and genotype (equal number of 
common alleles c.622C→T and c.509-1G→C).10 
We performed a sensitivity analysis in which 
we matched one treated patient with many his-
torical controls to confirm the robustness of 
the results (see the Supplementary Appendix). 
Changes from baseline in MRI measurement of 
gray-matter volume were summarized descrip-
tively.
Results
Characteristics of the Patients
The efficacy population consisted of 23 patients, 
all of whom continued to participate in the ex-
tension study. The demographic and clinical 
characteristics of the patients are summarized 
in Table 1. At the time of screening, most of the 
patients were at the lower boundary of the com-
bined motor–language score for inclusion in the 
study; 20 of the patients had a combined motor–
language score of 3 or 4 out of 6, and the me-
dian score among all the patients was 3. By the 
time of the initiation of the regimen of 300 mg 
of cerliponase alfa, the patients’ scores ranged 
from 1 to 6 (median, 3).
In the matched comparison between study 
patients and historical controls, six study pa-
tients could not be matched according to all 
three prespecified criteria with any of the chil-
dren in the control group, which resulted in 17 
matched pairs of patients for the analysis.
Administration of Study Drug
The mean (±SD) duration of treatment with any 
dose of cerliponase alfa was 117±33 weeks (range, 
1 to 161); the mean duration at the 300-mg dose 
was 115±30 weeks (range, 1 to 145). All the pa-
tients in the efficacy population received at least 
96 weeks of treatment at the 300-mg dose and 
received 99% of all planned doses.

Intraventricular Cerliponase Alfa for CLN2 Disease
Outcomes
Treated patients were less likely than historical 
controls to have an unreversed 2-point decline in 
the combined motor–language score (hazard ra-
tio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02 to 
0.23; P<0.001), as well as in the motor score 
alone (hazard ratio, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.29; 
P 
= 
0.002) and in the language score alone (haz-
ard ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.52; P 
= 
0.003) 
(Fig. 2). The median time until a 2-point decline 
in the score on the motor–language scale was 
not reached among the treated patients and was 
345 days (49.3 weeks) among the historical con-
trols; 9% of the treated patients had a decline of 
2 points at 345 days.
The unadjusted mean rate of decline in the 
score on the motor–language scale per 48-week 
period was 0.27±0.35 points among the 23 treated 
patients as compared with 2.12±0.98 among the 
42 historical controls, a difference of 1.85±0.21 
points (95% CI, 1.51 to 2.18; P<0.001). After ad-
justment for the baseline covariates (age, motor–
language score, and genotype), the rate of de-
cline was 0.38±0.10 points among the treated 
patients and 2.06±0.15 among the historical 
controls, a mean difference of 1.68 points (95% 
CI, 1.29 to 2.06; P<0.001).
In the comparison of 17 matched pairs of 
children, the treated patients had a mean de-
crease from baseline in the motor–language score 
of 0.20±0.67 points after 48 weeks of treatment, 
as compared with a decrease of 1.90±1.23 points 
among the historical controls during the same 
period (Fig. 3A). After 96 weeks, the mean de-
crease in the motor–language score was 0.50±0.71 
points among the treated patients and 2.80±1.10 
points among the historical controls. Two of 
the treated patients who had a baseline motor–
language score of 6 did not lose a point during 
the study period.
On the total four-domain scale, the treated 
patients had a mean increase of 0.30±1.70 
points, as compared with a decrease of 2.80±2.04 
points in the historical controls, after 48 weeks 
of treatment (Fig. 3B). After 96 weeks, the mean 
increase in the total score among treated pa-
tients was 0.40±2.08 points, as compared with a 
decrease of 4.30±2.26 points among the histori-
cal controls. Between-group differences for the 
entire set of matched comparisons are provided 
in Figure S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
In the treatment group, the mean percent 
change in gray-matter volume was a decrease 
of 12.4±9.2% from baseline to 96 weeks, which 
represented an annualized decrease of 6.7% (a 
decrease of 10.5% in the first year and 3.3% in 
the second year) (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The rate of change in gray-matter 
volume was not measured in the control group.
Adverse Events
The safety population consisted of 24 patients, 
including 1 patient who had dropped out after 
only one dose of the study drug because of an 
unwillingness to continue with study visits and 
procedures. There were no deaths and no study 
discontinuations because of an adverse event.

Intraventricular Cerliponase Alfa for CLN2 Disease
Figure 3. Mean Change from Baseline in Two-Domain and Four-Domain Scores in Matched Comparisons with Historical 
Controls.
Shown is the change from baseline in the score for motor and language function (Panel A) and in the score for all 
four domains of the CLN2 Rating Scale (motor, language, vision, and seizure domains) (Panel B) in the two matched 
study groups. At 49 weeks, the mean change from baseline in the combined score for motor and language function 
was −0.2 among treated patients and −1.9 among historical controls; at 97 weeks, the mean change was −0.5 and 
−2.8, respectively. At 49 weeks, the mean change from baseline in the four-domain score was 0.3 among treated pa-
tients and −2.8 among historical controls; at 97 weeks, the mean change was 0.4 and −4.3, respectively. The I bars 
indicate standard errors.

Figure 2 (facing page). Time until the First 2-Point Decline on the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale.
Shown are Kaplan–Meier curves for the time until the primary efficacy outcome, which was defined as an unreversed decrease from base-
line of 2 or more points in the combined score for motor and language function or a combined score of 0 on the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale. 
The same analysis was performed for the language score and motor score individually. Baseline was defined as the last observation before 
the initiation of a 300-mg regimen of cerliponase alfa. After adjustment for baseline scores on the rating scale (for combined motor and 
 
language function, motor function, and language function), age, genotype, and sex, patients who received the study drug were significant-
ly less likely than those in the historical control group to have the primary efficacy outcome for combined motor and language function 
(Panel A), for motor function alone (Panel B), and for language function alone (Panel C). Tick marks indicate censoring of data.

patients had at least one adverse event (Table 2, 
and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The most common adverse events were convul-
sions (96%), pyrexia (71%), vomiting (63%), hyper-
sensitivity reactions (63%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (54%), and nasopharyngitis and rhini-
tis (42% each). Ten patients (42%) had an ad-
verse event with a maximum severity of grade 1 
or 2; 14 patients (58%) had at least one adverse 
event of grade 3 or higher. There was one serious 
grade 4 adverse event of unprovoked status epi-
lepticus, which occurred 7 days after the last 
infusion and lasted for 45 minutes.
Among the 55 serious adverse events that 
were reported in 20 patients (83%), 11 were con-
sidered by investigators to be related to either 
the study drug or the intraventricular device 
(Table 2, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The most common serious adverse 
events were hypersensitivity (29%), upper respi-
ratory tract infection (21%), epilepsy (17%), 
pharyngitis (17%), gastroenteritis (13%), pyrexia 
(8%), and device-related infection (8%). All the 
adverse events resolved spontaneously or with 
appropriate medical management, which allowed 
for subsequent administration of the study drug.
Fifteen patients (63%) had a total of 37 hyper-
sensitivity adverse events, most of which were of 
grade 1 or 2 (Table S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The 8 patients who had a serious or 
grade 3 hypersensitivity adverse event had nega-
tive results on testing for serum drug-specific 
IgE. There were no adverse events of anaphy-
laxis or anaphylactoid reactions, according to 
the criteria of the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases.
Twelve patients (50%) had 34 device-related 
adverse events, of which 5 events were of grade 
3 in 4 patients (Table S7 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Three of these events were device-
related infections that were detected on moni-
toring of cerebrospinal fluid in 2 patients; the 
culture of a sample obtained from 1 patient 
grew Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the other pa-
tient had two episodes of Propionibacterium acnes 
infection. These device-related infections were 
diagnosed by culture and occurred without re-
ports of headache, fever, photophobia, or nuchal 
rigidity. The 2 patients were treated with anti-
biotics and removal of the intraventricular de-
vice, which led to an interruption in treatment. 
The patients continued treatment after device 
replacement. One patient had grade 3 device 
leakage owing to the rupture of the silicone dome 
of the intraventricular device, and 1 patient had 
a grade 3 increase in the white-cell count in the 
cerebrospinal fluid. Other device-related adverse 
events, including needle displacement and de-
vice leakage, were grade 1 in severity.

Intraventricular Cerliponase Alfa for CLN2 Disease
The cerebrospinal fluid was tested before 
each infusion. An increased white-cell count was 
seen throughout the study in 4 patients (17%) 
who were asymptomatic without evidence of in-
fection on Gram’s staining and culture. Changes 
that were seen on 12-lead electrocardiography 
(nonspecific repolarization abnormalities, sinus 
arrhythmia, superventricular extrasystoles, and 
biphasic T waves) in 17 patients (71%) were de-
termined not to be clinically adverse by the in-
vestigators. Transient asymptomatic decreases 
in blood pressure that occurred in more than 
2 consecutive measurements were observed in 
8 patients (33%).
Discussion
In a small group of children with CLN2 disease 
who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years, 
the rate of clinical decline was lower among 
those who received intraventricular infusion of 
cerliponase alfa than among historical controls. 
The study was designed as an open-label, single-
group study and an extension study. A statistical 
comparison with a historical control group (in-
cluding patient-level matching and covariate ad-
justments) was used to control for possible con-
founders. A treatment benefit was shown in the 
efficacy population over a period of at least 96 
weeks, although the treatment period was longer 
for most patients at the time of the data cutoff 
(median, 116 weeks; range, 96 to 145). All 23 
patients in the efficacy population continued in 
the extension study. Among the treated patients, 
the annual rate of loss of total gray-matter vol-
ume during a 96-week period was 6.7%, with 
larger decreases seen during the first year of 
treatment than during the second year.
Intraventricular administration maximizes de-
livery of cerliponase alfa to the central nervous 
system and may reduce the risk of immune-
mediated adverse events that have been associ-
ated with systemic enzyme-replacement thera-
py.15-17 Serious adverse events reflected treatment 
with exogenous protein into the ventricular sys-
tem and complications from the intraventricular 
device. Three serious device-related infections oc-
curred in two patients. Both patients continued 
therapy after removal of the intraventricular de-
vice, treatment with antibiotics, and subsequent 
replacement of the device, but treatment with 
cerliponase alfa was delayed. Serious adverse 
events also included device leakage and hyper-
sensitivity reactions. Further study is required 
to determine whether intraventricular enzyme-
replacement treatment is appropriate in other 
lysosomal storage disorders that have manifesta-
tions in the central nervous system.
In conclusion, intraventricular administration 
of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks at a dose of 
300 mg in children with CLN2 disease resulted 
in a slower rate of decline in motor and language 
function than that in historical controls. The po-
tential uses of intraventricular cerliponase alfa 
to prevent the onset of symptoms in young pa-
tients and to delay or prevent changes in vision 
warrant further study. Intraventricular enzyme-
replacement therapy was associated with device-
related complications, including grade 3 infec-
tion, leakage, and an increased white-cell count 
in cerebrospinal fluid in half the patients.
