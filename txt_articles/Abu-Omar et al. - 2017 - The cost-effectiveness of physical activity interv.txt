Background: Despite growing recognition of the need to promote physical activity, the existing evidence base on
the cost-effectiveness of relevant interventions appears scant and scattered. This systematic review of reviews set
out to take stock of the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions.
Methods: Ten literature databases were systematically searched for available reviews on the cost-effectiveness of
physical activity interventions, complemented by a hand search. Out of the 515 articles identified, 18 reviews
met the inclusion criteria. A quality appraisal of the 18 reviews was undertaken.
Results: Of the 18 reviews, 4 contained information on the target group of children and adolescents, 12 on
adults, 3 on older adults, and 6 on the general population. Across the reviews some intervention strategies were
identified as being particularly cost-effective, including certain school-based interventions (children and ado-
lescents), interventions using pedometers (adults), fall prevention programs (older people), mass media cam-
paigns and environmental approaches (general population). However, for some of these approaches (e.g. mass
media campaigns), the underlying evidence of being able to change physical activity behavior remains incon-
sistent.
Conclusion: Available evidence for the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions is scattered, but points
towards the cost-effectiveness of certain interventions. Until this moment, cost-effectiveness has more often been
studied for individual-level interventions. This is potentially due to some methodological challenges in assessing
the cost-effectiveness of population-based interventions.
1. Introduction
Arguments for efforts to promote physical activity on the population
level are increasingly based on calculations of the costs of inactivity.
For example, a recent study estimated the costs for health care systems
attributable to physical inactivity to be 54 billion (INT$) worldwide in
2013 (Ding et al., 2016). In another study, it has been stated that a 20%
reduction of inactivity rates on the population level would already yield
important cost savings (ISCA/CEBR, 2015). Such figures might have
contributed to international calls for increasing physical activity pro-
motion efforts (European Union, 2008; World Health Organization,
2004; World Health Organization, 2013).
In order to make informed public health decisions on how to pro-
mote physical activity, information on the overall effectiveness of dif-
ferent intervention types to increase physical activity, and considera-
tions of cost-effectiveness of different interventions types are highly
relevant. While an impressive number of reviews have been conducted
on the topic of effectiveness of physical activity promotion (a recent
scoping review yielded more than 350 reviews; Rütten et al., 2016), the
interest in assessing the cost-effectiveness of physical activity inter-
ventions appears to have grown only recently, as evidenced by a series
of relevant systematic reviews that have been published in the last
5 years (Campbell et al., 2015; GC et al., 2015; Laine et al., 2014; Foster
et al., 2013; Balzer et al., 2012; Lehnert et al., 2012). Mainly, existing
reviews on the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions have
focused on particular target groups (e.g. older people; Balzer et al.,
2012), specific intervention types (e.g. face-to-face interventions;
Gordon et al., 2007), or specific settings where interventions were
conducted (e.g. worksite; van Van Dongen et al., 2011). Only some
reviews have presented findings across different target groups, inter-
vention types, and settings (e.g. Laine et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2011).

 all relevant studies, bias can be minimized in well conducted systematic
reviews. More recently, overviews of systematic reviews have been used
to summarize research evidence relevant to a wide range of health in-
terventions (Hartling et al., 2014; Thomson et al., 2010). In the present
paper we took stock of the state of the evidence on the cost-effective-
ness of physical activity interventions by critically reviewing and syn-
thesizing published systematic reviews on the topic.
To the best of our knowledge, the present systematic review of re-
views on the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions is the
first such endeavor. We utilized rigorous methodology, systematically
screened the international literature, and appraised and summarized
the evidence. The intention of this endeavor was to provide a more
comprehensive overview regarding the available evidence for the cost-
effectiveness of physical activity promotion efforts. Such knowledge
might be valuable to inform decisions regarding efforts to promote
physical activity on the population level.
2. Methods
This systematic review of reviews was based on a literature search
in each of the following 10 databases: PubMed, Scopus, EBSCOHost,
PsychInfo, SPORTDiscus, EBSCON-ECON LIT, Pro-Quest, ERIC, IBSS
and NHSEED. A title and abstract search was conducted and restricted
to reviews published between January 2000 and October 2015. Search
terms linked with ‘AND’ were “physical activity”, “cost”, “interven-
tion”, “systematic review”, and “health outcome”. For each search term,
related terms were added as alternatives using ‘OR’ (e.g. for “physical
activity”: physical fitness, active lifestyle, moving, move*, sport*, ex-
ercis*, biking, bike*, bicycl*, cycling, cycle, walk*, active transport*,
active travel, active commut*, human powered transport). Additionally,
a hand search was conducted, which included a systematic search of
websites (e.g. WHO, NICE UK) that featured articles or reports that are
not necessarily indexed in peer-reviewed journals. Additionally, the
authors gathered reviews of which they were aware and that were not
located by the systematic literature search.
Two reviewers firstly screened the titles and abstracts from all
search results and later the full text. Reviews were included if they met
the following criteria:
• Language of the article was English or German.
• The article was a review that either modeled or summarized health
economic evaluations of physical activity interventions.
• The article included a description of how the literature was identi-
fied, and stated inclusion and exclusion criteria.

 • Interventions included in the article aimed at increasing physical
activity or improving health (via increasing physical activity).
• Interventions targeted healthy individuals.
All included reviews were summarized independently by two re-
viewers following an extraction table. Disagreements were resolved by
discussion, and by a third reviewer analyzing the review. In analyzing
the results of the different reviews, we used the term “cost saving” to
indicate that the costs of an intervention were actually outweighed by
the benefits (e.g. saved medical costs) it achieved. In comparison, “cost-
effectiveness” implied that the costs of an intervention were not out-
weighed by the benefits, but rather that the intervention provided
“good value for money” compared to alternative intervention options
(Drummond et al., 2015; Kelly et al., 2005).
Quality appraisals were performed by following the Quality
Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies of the National Collaborating
Centre for Methods and Tools (National Collaborating Centre for
Methods and Tools, 2008). The tool appraises the methodological
quality of reviews by different criteria (e.g. focused research question,
appropriate inclusion criteria, comprehensive search strategy, descrip-
tion of level of evidence, assessment of methodological quality of pri-
mary studies, appropriateness of combining results across studies). The
more criteria are fulfilled, the higher the quality of the review is rated.
Results were categorized by target group (children and adolescents,
adults, older people and the general population), taking a life-course
perspective. Within these different target groups, results were cate-
gorized by settings (e.g. for children and adolescents: family and home
setting, child care facilities, schools). This categorization was developed
and utilized in the German Recommendations for Physical Activity and
Physical Activity Promotion (Rütten and Pfeifer, 2016).
3. Results
3.1. Literature search
In the first step of the literature search, 515 references (excluding
247 duplicates) were identified. After reviewing titles and abstracts, 41
documents were selected for further analysis by reading the full text. Of
those, 8 met the inclusion criteria and were selected. Additionally, 10
reviews were identified via hand search. In total, the analysis included
18 reviews (Fig. 1).
For the most part, the methodological quality of the reviews was
high. Fourteen out of the 18 reviews were assigned a high methodo-
logical quality (Table 1). Most reviews focused on more than one target
group. Four reviews were concerned with children and adolescents. The
target group of adults was covered in 12 reviews, and the target group
of older people in 3 reviews. Six reviews covered the general population
(Table 2).
3.2. Reviews on the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions in
children and adolescents
Three of the four reviews on this target group (Laine et al., 2014;
Lehnert et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2011) dealt with physical activity in-
terventions in schools. Laine et al. (2014), and Wu et al. (2011) both
cautiously considered school interventions to be cost-effective. How-
ever, both reviews included a diverse set of school-based interventions
(from health education to environmental modifications) that varied
substantially regarding the size of cost-effectiveness. Lehnert et al.
(2012) primarily included school-based interventions that promoted
active commuting in the review. In this review, such interventions were
unlikely to be cost-effective.
Lewis et al. (2010) investigated physical activity interventions in
the family and home, school, and community settings. The review
found some interventions to be cost-effective (e.g. dance classes and
walking school bus programs), whereas others were found to be cost-
effective only for a particular group of children (e.g. curriculum-based
interventions for healthy diet and physical activity in girls only), or not
cost-effective at all (e.g. free swimming classes).
3.3. Reviews on the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions in
adults
Twelve reviews focused on interventions in adults. Of those, three
investigated interventions in the workplace setting (Van Dongen et al.,
2011; Lewis et al., 2010; Müller-Riemenschneider et al., 2009). Results
across
the
three
reviews
remained
inconclusive,
with
Müller-
Riemenschneider et al. (2009) reporting no cost-effectiveness, Van
Dongen et al. (2011) reporting no cost-effectiveness when investiga-
tions utilized RCT trial designs, and cost-effectiveness when other study
designs were utilized, and Lewis et al. (2010) reporting worksite in-
terventions as being cost-effective or even cost-saving.
Two reviews analyzed the cost-effectiveness of pedometer interventions
(GC et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2010). Such interventions had the highest cost-
effectiveness compared to other interventions in the review of GC et al.
(2015). Lewis et al. (2010) identified pedometer based interventions as
being cost-effective or cost-saving in two out of three included studies.
Eight reviews investigated the cost-effectiveness of interventions for
physical activity promotion in the health care setting (Campbell et al.,
2015; GC et al., 2015; Pavey et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2011; Garrett et al.,
2011; Lewis et al., 2010; Müller-Riemenschneider et al., 2009; Williams
et al., 2007). The review of Garrett et al. (2011) blended interventions
that take place in the health-care or community setting.
Of the reviews, 3 saw good cost-effectiveness for such interventions
(GC et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2010; Müller-Riemenschneider et al.,
2009). Two reviews saw either no cost-effectiveness (Williams et al.,
2007) or only in a very limited way (Campbell et al., 2015). The re-
views of Garrett et al. (2011), Pavey et al. (2011) and Wu et al. (2011)
pointed towards some more specific results. In all 3, rather brief advice
and/or unsupervised exercise programs reached good cost-effective-
ness. On the other hand, more extensive advice and supervised exercise
programs seemed to achieve lower cost-effectiveness.
Gordon et al. (2007) investigated face-to-face interventions. These
were mainly structured exercise programs or physical activity coun-
seling in different setting. The authors concluded that the interventions
among this target group were, in general, cost-effective.
Foster et al. (2013) reported a lack of studies to deduce cost-effec-
tiveness regarding computer-based and other new technology-driven
interventions.
Wolfenstetter and Wenig (2010) investigated various interventions
in the worksite, health care and community setting. As intervention
types, this review includes among others exercise referral schemes,
physical activity counseling and exercise programmes. Most studies
included were deemed as being cost-effective.
3.4. Reviews on the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions in
older adults
The reviews of Balzer et al. (2012), Davis et al. (2009) and Windle
et al. (2010) concentrated on physical activity interventions targeting
older people.
Windle et al. (2010) investigated studies that attempted to promote
mental health and well-being through physical activity. Only one of
these studies included an economic evaluation, rating the intervention
as being cost-effective.
Davis et al. (2009) and Balzer et al. (2012) focused on studies of fall
prevention. Davis et al. (2009) showed that tailored interventions that
include strength and balance training and multi-component interven-
tions are cost-effective or cost-saving. Balzer et al. (2012) included
quite similar studies in their review. Also in this review, such physical
activity interventions for fall prevention were deemed to be cost-ef-
fective.

 3.5. Reviews on the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions in
the general population
The reviews of Lehnert et al. (2012) and Lewis et al. (2010) in-
vestigated the cost-effectiveness of mass-media campaigns for the pro-
motion of physical activity. Both identified such mass media campaigns
as being highly cost-effective.
Wu et al. (2011) rated point-of-decision prompts as being highly
cost-effective.
Community-based multi-component approaches were covered in the
reviews of Lehnert et al. (2012) and Wu et al. (2011). Both reviews
reported inconclusive evidence, stating that cost-effectiveness measures
outcomes differed greatly between single studies. Nevertheless, in both
reviews some community campaigns were cost-effective.
Environmental modifications are an important physical activity
promotion strategy. The review of Cavill et al. (2008) synthesized ex-
clusively interventions designed to improve the infrastructures for
human-powered transportation. While the review could only build on a
methodologically limited and diverse set of primary studies, the authors
saw evidence for the cost-effectiveness of such approaches. Laine et al.
(2014) also reported highly diverse results, with the most cost-effective
and the least cost-effective interventions being simultaneously the de-
velopment of rail-trails. Large differences in estimates of cost-effec-
tiveness across single studies were also reported by Wu et al. (2011).
Lewis et al. (2010) saw strong evidence for environmental modifica-
tions to be cost-effective. Also, in the review of Müller-Riemenschneider
et al. (2009), the development of trails was seen as being cost-effective.
Table 3 summarizes the findings across age groups and settings.
4. Discussion
4.1. Main findings
This systematic review of reviews conducted a comprehensive
summary and analysis of the existing literature on the cost-effectiveness
of physical activity interventions. While our review pointed to favor-
able cost-effectiveness of many physical activity interventions, it also
identified a number of methodological limitations from previous stu-
dies, and highlighted challenges for future research that will outline in
this section.
As a key result, there was some evidence that physical activity in-
terventions are cost-effective. However, there remain considerable gaps
in the literature regarding cost-effectiveness of different types of in-
terventions. Nevertheless, evidence for cost-effectiveness, could be
found for most school-based interventions except for the promotion of
active transport (for children and adolescents), for pedometer inter-
ventions and brief intervention in the health care setting (in adults), for
interventions on fall prevention (in older people), and for environ-
mental approaches and mass media campaigns (general population).
The evidence mostly comes from a limited number of reviews.
Placing these findings within a public health perspective is im-
portant: For children and adolescents, there is an urgent need to more
specifically investigate which type of school-based physical activity
interventions are cost-effective. One review concluded that multi-
component interventions that do not require the hiring of additional
staff seem to be particularly cost-effective (Wu et al., 2011). Another

 review concluded that interventions promoting active transport in
children are not cost-effective (Lehnert et al., 2012).
Regarding adults, exercise referral schemes were investigated in
several reviews. Results remain inconclusive. There might be some in-
dication that such schemes are more cost-effective when targeting in-
dividuals carrying risk factors, compared to healthy individuals. Not
surprisingly, the cost-effectiveness results of any such schemes will
crucially depend on how costly such schemes are in the first place (e.g.
hiring professional instructors for exercise groups compared to lay
people). Such findings point in the direction of the need to carefully
plan exercise referral schemes (e.g. in terms of target group and inter-
vention costs) prior to potential scale-up.
Some cautious remarks are called for regarding mass media cam-
paigns in the general population: The WHO (2011) considers mass
media campaigns as a “best buy” for the prevention of chronic diseases.
This was supported by two reviews included in our analysis that saw
good cost-effectiveness of this intervention type (Lehnert et al., 2012;
Lewis et al., 2010). However, there has been considerable debate about
the effectiveness of such interventions in initiating behavior change
(Brown et al., 2012; Vos et al., 2010), thus questioning the results of
these cost-effectiveness analyses. Also, it has been shown that mass
media campaigns might rather increase health inequalities (Lorenc
et al., 2012). Regarding point-of-decision-prompts, review results also
indicated a high potential for cost-effectiveness. However, it has to be
taken into account that such interventions only seem to result in very
minor physical activity increases for individuals (Wu et al., 2011).
4.2. Methodological limitations and challenges
This review has identified a number of methodological limitations
of previous studies and challenges for future research (Wolfenstetter
and Wenig, 2010).
Across reviews and included single studies, it is apparent that in-
dividual level interventions are investigated for cost-effectiveness more
often. Compared to e.g. population level interventions, these studies are
more likely to be based on widely accepted study designs, in particular
randomized-controlled trials. At the same time, it seems apparent from
the reviewed studies that population-level interventions have higher
potential for cost-effectiveness. As such, it might be warranted to con-
duct more research investigating these types of interventions. However,
study designs often perceived as having a high methodological quality
are generally much more difficult to apply, and may even be in-
appropriate to population-level interventions. For example, policy and
environmental approaches to physical activity promotion are highly
“contextual”, i.e. depending on certain collective decisions within a
specific environment (e.g. a municipality that wants to establish bi-
cycle-friendly infrastructures). Studies on such approaches often have
to be designed as an evaluation of a “natural experiment”, with the
attendant challenge of identifying a truly causal impact of the inter-
vention (Brownson et al., 2006). As a consequence, our review found a
general lack of studies on population-level physical activity interven-
tions. Moreover, many of the articles on environmental approaches
included in the reviews, e.g. on promoting active transport, are simu-
lation studies, and as such not based on “real world” interventions
(Macmillan et al., 2014; Cavill et al., 2008; Rutter, 2006).
We identified several contradicting conclusions between reviews.
Those might be caused by the heterogeneity of methodological ap-
proaches used in the different reviews: First, across reviews, quite dif-
ferent interventions have been included in any given category. For
example, regarding the school setting, Wu et al. (2011) and Laine et al.
(2014) mainly included studies on multi-component and environmental
approaches to promote physical activity, and both draw positive
conclusions on cost-effectiveness. Contrastingly, Lehnert et al. (2012)
mainly included studies on active transport to school with more nega-
tive results. Second, the reviews tend to report on different outcomes:
For example physical activity at school (Laine et al., 2014), total phy-
sical activity (Campbell et al., 2015; Müller-Riemenschneider et al.,
2009) or overweight/obesity rates (Lehnert et al., 2012). Third, dif-
ferent definitions of benefits are used. For example, “Quality Adjusted
Life Years” (GC et al., 2015), reduction of absenteeism (Pavey et al.,
2011), reduced medical costs (Williams et al., 2007), or productivity
gained (Van Dongen et al., 2011). Fourth, differences existed across
reviews regarding how to conduct the health economic analysis: while
most reviews conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-benefit ana-
lysis was frequently used when investigating the effects of physical
activity interventions in the worksite setting (Van Dongen et al., 2011)
or active transport (Cavill et al., 2008).
In spite of the many differences between reviews, one rather
methodological issue seemed to permeate analyses of cost-effectiveness:
The existing curvilinear relationship between physical activity level and
health benefits. It is a well established fact in physical activity research
that the more active an individual is prior to the physical activity in-
tervention, the smaller the health gains of this individual will be if he/
she engages in additional physical activity (Warburton and Bredin,
2016). That is to say that, for instance, a sedentary individual who takes
up exercise twice a week will likely have bigger health gains when
compared to an individual that increased her/his exercise behavior
from twice to four times a week. To our knowledge, very few cost-
effectiveness studies consider such a curvilinear relationship between
physical activity and health benefits. This might influence results re-
garding the cost-effectiveness of different interventions.
4.3. The public health relevance of cost-effectiveness reviews of physical
activity interventions
The most important finding of our review of reviews might be that
existing knowledge on cost-effectiveness of physical activity interven-
tions is currently scattered and of somewhat limited practical public
health value. Taking a national or global perspective (which would
need to include developing and developed nations), few interventions
for physical activity have consistently shown to be cost-effective across
reviews. For these interventions, the reviews contained very little in-
formation regarding their impact on health inequalities, scale-up costs,
and distribution of costs and benefits between the public and other
sectors.
In order to overcome such limitations, we would suggest the fol-
lowing way forward:
(1) Increasing efforts to conduct natural experiments to investigate the
effectiveness of policy and environmental approaches to physical
activity promotion. Based on the promising result of such inter-
ventions to promote physical activity and their potential to combat
health inequalities (Lorenc et al., 2012), more efforts should be
dedicated to strengthening the evidence-base for the cost-effec-
tiveness of these intervention strategies.
(2) Relaxing inclusion criteria for reviews on the cost-effectiveness of
physical activity promotion studies to allow for the inclusion of
natural experiments. Limiting such reviews to rigorous study de-
signs such as randomized-controlled studies might be counter-pro-
ductive, since this leaves out more promising interventions that
cannot easily be studied by these designs.
(3) Agreeing on a common classification of interventions and outcome
measures in order to increase the comparability of results across
studies and reviews. The value of conducting reviews could be

 vastly increased if their results could be more directly compared,
and if they were built upon agreed categorizations of intervention
types and outcome measures.
(4) Developing a research agenda that more clearly seeks to provide
specific answers to which intervention strategies should be inter-
nationally scaled-up for physical activity promotion. Such an
agenda should be concerned, beyond health equity, with identifying
important target groups for physical activity promotion efforts,
intervention strategies that require little upfront costs and are thus
suitable for e.g. developing nations, and intervention strategies that
can be used within certain contexts.
