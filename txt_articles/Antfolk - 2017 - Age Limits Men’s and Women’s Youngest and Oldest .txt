Age Limits: Men’s and Women’s
Youngest and Oldest Considered
and Actual Sex Partners
Jan Antfolk1
Abstract
Whereas women of all ages prefer slightly older sexual partners, men—regardless of their age—have a preference for women in
their 20s. Earlier research has suggested that this difference between the sexes’ age preferences is resolved according to women’s
preferences. This research has not, however, sufficiently considered that the age range of considered partners might change over
the life span. Here we investigated the age limits (youngest and oldest) of considered and actual sex partners in a population-based
sample of 2,655 adults (aged 18-50 years). Over the investigated age span, women reported a narrower age range than men and
women tended to prefer slightly older men. We also show that men’s age range widens as they get older: While they continue to
consider sex with young women, men also consider sex with women their own age or older. Contrary to earlier suggestions,
men’s sexual activity thus reflects also their own age range, although their potential interest in younger women is not likely
converted into sexual activity. Compared to homosexual men, bisexual and heterosexual men were more unlikely to convert
young preferences into actual behavior, supporting female-choice theory.

In several studies men’s and women’s sexual age preferences
(i.e., the preferred age of a potential partner) and/or the age of
actual sex partners have been investigated. In their seminal
paper, Kenrick and Keefe (1992) showed that men’s and
women’s sexual age preferences have different developmental
trajectories. As a person grows older, the person’s sexual age
preferences tend to change, and, as a general rule, the age of
desirable partners also increases. The magnitude of this
increase differs between the sexes. For women, a year’s
increase in her own age is relatively closely matched to a
similar increase in the desired partners’ age. Women tend to
prefer partners who are similar to or somewhat older than they
themselves are (e.g., Kenrick & Keefe, 1992). Men, on the
other hand, clearly age faster than their desired partners, and
a year’s increase in his own age is accompanied by a smaller
increase in the desired partner’s age (e.g., Antfolk et al., 2015).
Young men (aged < 20 years) are interested in somewhat older
partners than themselves, but as time passes and men age, the
interest in partners in their mid-20s is maintained. The result is
that older men tend to be interested in women younger than
themselves (Antfolk et al., 2015; Kenrick, Gabrielidis, Keefe,
& Cornelius, 1996). Generally speaking, earlier studies suggest
that heterosexual men—irrespective of their own age—are
attracted to women in their 20s and that very few men are
exclusively interested in very young or very old women (e.g.,
Santtila et al., 2015; Tripodi et al., 2015). This pattern has been
demonstrated in modern Western and non-Western cultures
(Buss, 1989; Buunk, Dijkstra, Kenrick, & Wrantjes, 2001;
Sohn, 2016; Souza, Conroy-Beam, & Buss, 2016) and is
accompanied by some indirect evidence from hunter-gatherer
societies (e.g., Early & Peters, 2000; Marlowe, 2004) and pre-
industrial societies (e.g., Dribe & Lundh, 2009). Studies have
used various measures, including surveys (Antfolk et al., 2015;

 Buss, 1989; Kenrick et al., 1996), dating advertisements (Dunn,
Brinton, & Clark, 2010; Hayes, 1995; Pawlowski & Dunbar,
1999), marriage announcements (Otta, da Silva Queiroz, de
Sousa Campos, Dowbor Da Silva, & Telles Silveira, 1999),
online chat rooms (Bergen, Antfolk, Jern, Alanko, & Sant-
tila, 2013), and by investigating earnings by prostitutes
(Sohn, 2016). In this context, it is also important to separate
between studies investigating sexual interest, actual sexual
behavior, or age disparity in long-term relationships. Age
disparity in long-term relationships is likely a compromise
between both women’s and men’s interests (although the
relative weight of these two interests likely differ across
cultural contexts). This is also true for sexual behavior. Sex,
in most cases, necessitates that the sexual interest of two
individuals overlap. For example, studies looking at mar-
riage announcements will be informative regarding age dis-
parity in relationships and provide only limited information
regarding differences in sexual interest. For example,
Buunk, Dijkstra, Kenrick, and Wrantjes (2001) showed that
men prefer older partners for short-term versus long-term
mating, suggesting that age preferences depend on the
amount of involvement. A similar finding was later pre-
sented in a study by Young, Critelli, and Keith (2005).
Heterosexual women’s sexual interest in slightly older
men has been explained as reflecting the human bi-
maturation process, by which females mature earlier than
males (van den Berghe, 1992), and/or as a trade-off
between the increased social dominance and the decrease
in remaining life span in older men (Antfolk et al., 2015).
That heterosexual men’s sexual age preferences is focused
at women in their 20s has been explained as the evolution-
ary consequence of this age being associated with high
female fecundity and peak copulation to conception ratios
(Sozou & Hartshorne, 2012; Tietze, 1957; Wood, 1989).
The risk for miscarriages and chromosomal abnormalities
in the offspring also becomes approximately 10 times
higher in 40-year-old mothers compared to 25-year-old
mothers (Hecht & Hook, 1996; Heffner, 2004), and this
increase is paired with an increased risk of neuropsychiatric
disorders such as autism in offspring (Shelton, Tancredi, &
Hertz-Picciotto, 2010).
A female partner’s age is thus associated with men’s
probability of producing offspring (and this offspring being
healthy), and men who prefer sex with relatively old
women would thus have left relatively few allele copies
to future generations. To the extent these alleles are asso-
ciated with sexual age preferences, such preferences would
become decreasingly rare in the population (e.g., Kenrick &
Keefe, 1992).
What about sexual age preferences in homosexual (vs. het-
erosexual) men and women? Studies on this topic suggest that
age preferences in homosexual individuals are largely similar
to those of heterosexual individuals: Like their heterosexual
counterparts, homosexual men show a tendency to be sexually
interested in young men and homosexual women show a ten-
dency to be interested in women in their own age range (Hayes,
1995; Kenrick, Keefe, Bryan, Barr, & Brown, 1995; Sil-
verthorne & Quinsey, 2000). These findings have been taken
to support the modularity hypothesis of sexual orientation. The
modularity hypothesis (e.g., Symons, 1979) explains homo-
sexuality as different from heterosexuality only with respect
to the sex of the desired partner and suggests that homosexual
and heterosexual individuals show similar patterns regarding
other aspects of sexual psychology. Thus, no differences in age
preferences would be expected based on sexual orientation
alone. Very little is known about age preferences in bisexuals.
A study by Adam (2000) suggests, however, that both homo-
sexual men and bisexual men display the same interest in
young partners as heterosexual men do.
Another, related observation is that both heterosexual
men’s and heterosexual women’s actual sexual behavior is
predicted by women’s sexual age preferences, and much
less by men’s sexual age preferences (Kenrick & Keefe,
1992). This finding has been explained as a function of
female choice. Parental investment theory (Trivers, 1972)
predicts that women are choosier than men with respect to
the characteristics of a potential sexual partner. The reason
for this is that women invest more than men in pregnancy,
child birth, and nurturing a child and therefore invest more
energy in the case of a pregnancy—a very possible conse-
quence of sex (Trivers, 1972). If female choosiness explains
the discrepancy between heterosexual men’s preferences
and actual behavior, a different pattern ought to emerge in
homosexual and heterosexual men. Homosexual men seek to
mate mainly with other men, and, if these men are less
choosy than women, homosexual men’s sexual interest
would more likely be converted into actual behavior. Hence,
in the context of sexual interest, no large differences in age
preferences is expected, but in the context of sexual beha-
vior, homosexual men are expected to have younger sexual
partners compared to heterosexual men.
One limitation in previous research is that scholars have
focused on either the most desirable age of partners or a
more abstract “mean age preference.” This approach has at
least two limitations: it does not appropriately consider the
range of an individual’s age preferences, as it assumes that
the upper age limit and the lower age limit change similarly
over the life span. Neglecting to look at the upper and lower
limits separately may therefore bias the results and lead to
wrongful conclusions. More specifically, this approach may
lead to overlooking the possibility that men’s age prefer-
ences widen over the years and that heterosexual men there-
fore also are sexually interested in the (older) women they
tend to have sex with.
The Current Study
In the current study, the aim was to expand on earlier find-
ings on sexual age preferences by investigating the age
limits representing the youngest and oldest individuals that
men and women could consider having sex with. We
expected (i) both women’s youngest and oldest considered
2
Evolutionary Psychology
 sex partners to be strongly and positively associated with
their own age. For men, we expected the oldest considered
sex partners would be strongly positively associated with
their own age, but that the youngest considered partners would
show a weaker association with their own age. In other words,
we expected men to throughout their life maintain an interest
in young women while also becoming interested in older and
older women. We also aimed to (ii) replicate the finding that
actual sexual behavior in heterosexual men and heterosexual
women is more closely predicted by women’s interests com-
pared to men’s interests. Moreover, we aimed to investigate
the effects of sexual orientation on age-related sexual interest
and sexual activity. In line with previous literature, we
expected that (iii) sexual orientation (within one sex) would
not be strongly associated with the age of considered partners.
As a further test of the female choice theory, we, however,
also aimed to test the expectation that (iv) actual sexual beha-
vior would not be as strongly associated with the age of con-
sidered partners in heterosexual men as it is in homosexual
men. We also explored age preferences in bisexual men
and women.
Method
Participants
Our final sample included observations from 2,676 individuals.
Of these individuals, 878 were male and 1,798 were female.
Female participants (M ¼ 33.35, SD ¼ 8.85) were slightly
younger than male participants (M ¼ 36.01, SD ¼ 8.46),
t(2,674) ¼ 7.40, p < .001. All participants included in the
analyses were between 18 and 50 years old (see Figure 3 in
Appendix for frequencies of participants across age and sex).
Data were obtained from the Finn-Kin data collection
(Albrecht et al., 2014), which contains a population-based sam-
ple of people living in Finland. This data collection was the
result of inviting a randomized sample of individuals aged 18–
49 to participate in an online survey of sex and family-related
topics. Invitations were sent out, obtaining addresses from the
central Population Registry of Finland that keeps information
about all individuals residing in Finland. Due to differences in
response rates, more women than men participated in the sur-
vey. (For more details on this data collection, see Albrecht
et al., 2014.)
Measures
Participants’ age. Participants reported their age using a
drop-down menu with answer options between 18 and 99
years of age.
Sexual orientation. To categorize individuals as homosexual,
bisexual, or heterosexual, we summed the responses to two
variables measuring sexual behavior with or sexual interest in
individuals of the same and opposite sexes. The reason to sum
responses across both actual behavior and interest was that
behavior is not always the result of interest. By summing
variables, both interest and behavior could be considered and
given equal weight. Thus, the responses to the two questions “if
there was a scale from heterosexual to homosexual, regarding
sexual behavior/erotic attraction” where would you place your-
self on this scale” were summed. Individuals with the sum
value 2 (lowest possible value) were coded as “heterosexual”
(n ¼ 1,604). Individuals with values 3 and 4 were coded as
“bisexual” (n ¼ 900), and individuals with values above 4 were
coded as “homosexual” (n ¼ 171).
The age of the youngest and oldest considered sex partner. Parti-
cipants reported the age of the youngest and oldest considered
sexual partner using a drop-down menu (answer options ranged
between 0 and 99) to answer the following questions: “With
how young a person could you consider having sex?” and
“With how old a person could you consider having sex?”
The age of the youngest and oldest actual sex partner. Participants
reported the age of the youngest and oldest sex partner they had
during the last 5 years. They used a drop-down menu (answer
options ranged between 0 and 99) to answer the following
questions: “With how young a person have you had sex during
the last 5 years?” and “With how old a person have you had sex
during the last 5 years?” (see Appendix for Swedish versions of
the questions).
Statistical Analyses
We first expected the variables of interest for possible out-
liers. Because our data included some extreme values (e.g.,
observations above 99 or younger than 10 years of age), we
removed these observations (3.1%, n ¼ 86) from the data file.
We decided to also include young teenagers to capture possi-
ble hebephilic interest. Although some observations remained
outside the 95% confidence intervals of the mean, we consid-
ered it possible that these observations were true observations
of the natural variation in age preferences (e.g., young respon-
dents displaying interest in young teenagers or old respon-
dents displaying an interest in older individuals) and chose
to keep them in the data file. The very low number of such
extreme observations would also not affect our main findings
in any major way. We also removed participants who reported
being older (0.4%, n ¼ 11) than the actual age limits for the
sampling frame (i.e., above 50 years old [50-year-olds were
included, because some individuals who was 49 years old at
the time of sampling could have turned 50 before respond-
ing]). Thus, the original sample size (n ¼ 2,773) was reduced
into its current size.
Results
Descriptive Results
A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that female
participants differed in age across the groups of sexual orienta-
tion, F(2) ¼ 48.42, p < .001. Also male participants differed in
age across groups of sexual orientation, F(2) ¼ 28.81, p < .001.

 One-way ANOVAs also showed significant differences
between groups of sexual orientation in female participants
for youngest, F(2) ¼ 88.84, p < .001, and oldest, F(2) ¼ 4.48,
p < .05, considered sex partners as well as for youngest,
F(2) ¼ 60.27, p < .001, and oldest, F(2) ¼ 21.25, p < .001, sex
partners. For male participants, there was a significant dif-
ference between the groups of sexual orientation for youngest,
F(2) ¼ 15.59, p < .001, but not oldest, F(2) ¼ 2.35, p ¼ .096,
considered sex partners. For youngest, F(2) ¼ 32.82, p < .001,
and oldest, F(2) ¼ 10.50, p < .001, actual partners, the differ-
ences were again significant (Table 1).
The Association Between Participant Age and the Age of
Considered Sex Partners
We then inspected the distribution of data across participant
age. This was first done by calculating the probability (propor-
tion of participants of a given age considering sex with a part-
ner of a certain age/number of participants of that given age)
that a partner would be included in the range of considered
partners, while accounting for both the participants’ and the
partners’ ages. For heterosexual male and female participants,
the distribution is visualized in Figure 1.
The relatively larger green area on the right panel compared
to the left panel in Figure 1 indicated that heterosexual female
participants were, on average, more likely to not consider sex
with men of certain ages than vice versa. Indeed, the probabil-
ity that female participants of a certain age could consider sex
with men of a certain age was below .33 in 36.5% of the
included ages and above .66 in only 44.4% of the included
ages. The probability that heterosexual male participants of a
certain age could consider sex with women of a certain age was
below .33 in only 12.9% of the included ages and above .66 in
as much as 68.0% of the included ages.
Considered and Actual Sex Partners by Participant Sex,
Age, and Sexual Orientation
To investigate the associations between participant age and the
age of concerning considered and actual sex partners, we con-
ducted a set of linear regressions. Here we conducted separate
regressions for the three groups of sexual orientation within
both male and female participants. All associations were pos-
itive, and all but two associations were statistically significant
(see Table 2 and Figure 2).
The age of the youngest considered sex partner increased
with the age of the participant in all groups apart from homo-
sexual male participants. In homosexual male participants, the
age of the youngest considered sex partner remained the same
across the measured life span. A comparison of confidence
intervals revealed that in bisexual and heterosexual male parti-
cipants, the age-related incline for age of the youngest consid-
ered sex partner was steeper than in homosexual male
participants. At the same time, the age-related incline in all
male groups was not as steep as in the female groups. Within
female participants, there were no noteworthy differences
between groups of sexual orientation.
The age of the oldest considered sex partner increased with
the age of the participant in all groups. Although the age-
related incline differed statistically between heterosexual and
bisexual male participants (slightly more horizontal) and het-
erosexual and bisexual female participants (slightly more
vertical), the difference was small. No other differences
were observed.
Female participants’ youngest and oldest considered sex
partners were strongly and positively associated with their own
age. For male participants, the age of the oldest considered sex
partners was strongly positively associated with their own age.
In the case of youngest considered partners, a weaker associa-
tion with participant age was found.
The age of the youngest actual sex partner also increased
with the age of the participant in all groups. Although there
were some small differences in the age-related incline between
male and female participants, the incline was similar in all
groups apart from homosexual men. Homosexual men showed
a less steep age-related incline than any other group. This sug-
gests that among male participants, sexual behavior was most
likely to reflect a preference for young partners in the homo-
sexual group.
The age-related incline for oldest actual sex partner was
strong in all participant groups and no noteworthy differences
were found.

Evolutionary Psychology
 Female Choice: Converting Interest Into Behavior
As a final test of female choice, we tested whether homosexual
men would be more likely than heterosexual male participants
to show a high correlation between the age of the youngest
considered sex partner and their youngest actual sex partner.
We investigated this by first calculating the partial correlation
between youngest considered sex partner and youngest actual
sex partner while controlling for own age. The partial correla-
tion between youngest imagined age and youngest actual part-
ner was weaker in heterosexual male participants (r ¼ .224,
p < .001) and bisexual male participants (r ¼ .205, p < .01) than
in homosexual male participants (r ¼ .540, p < .01).

(x-axis, left panel); and the proportion of hetero- and bisexual females of a certain age (y-axis, right panel), who could consider sex with men of a
certain age (y-axis, right panel). The terms “male” and “female” are used to describe participants, and the terms “men” and “women” are used to
describe considered partners. Red indicates high probabilities and green indicates low probabilities.

 Discussion
In the current study, we investigated the youngest and oldest
considered age for a sex partner and the youngest and oldest
age of a recent actual sex partner. Our population-based sample
of 2,655 individuals included both male and female partici-
pants. Participants of both sexes were grouped as heterosexual,
bisexual, and homosexual.
We expected to find patterns similar to previous studies
showing that women’s youngest and oldest considered sex
partners are strongly associated with their own age. For men,
however, we expected that only the oldest considered age
would be strongly associated with their own age, but that the
youngest considered age would show a weaker association with
their own age.
In line with earlier studies, we found that the sexual
age preferences change as a person ages, and that this
change is different between men and women. The major
difference between male and female participants related
to the age of the youngest considered sex partner. In
female participants, the youngest considered sex partner
aged with an average of 4.5 months each year. In male
participants this number was lower and the youngest con-
sidered sex partner aged with only 2 months each year.
Due to different starting points, this means that the
youngest considered age of a sex partner differed by as
much as 11 years between 50 years old male and female
participants. With respect to the oldest considered age of a
sex partner, there were only small differences between the
sexes. When taking the upper age limit into account, it
becomes clear that men’s sexual preferences also can explain
men’s sexual activity. Indeed, very few male participants
reported having sex with individuals they would consider too
old. This means that a comparison of men’s and women’s
age preferences and sexual behavior does not, as such, lend
conclusive support to the notion that heterosexual men’s sex-
ual behavior is restricted by female choice.

on the Y-axis and the participant’s age is presented on the X-axis. The black line is the reference line (Y ¼ X).

Evolutionary Psychology
 We also investigated the effects of sexual orientation (het-
erosexual vs. homosexual) on sexual age preferences and sex-
ual activity. We expected homosexual and heterosexual
individuals within one sex to have similar age preferences.
Indeed, the age limits were very similar between groups of
sexual orientation within both sexes. We also investigated
whether actual sexual behavior with young partners corre-
lated more strongly with an interest in young individuals in
homosexual male participants than in heterosexual male par-
ticipants. Homosexual male participants reported a closer
match between behavior and preferences than heterosexual
male participants. This strongly suggests that women’s sex-
ual interest constrain men’s behavior on the heterosexual
mating market.
Bisexual male and female participants reported similar
preferences as heterosexual male and female participants.
Before drawing any conclusions based on these patterns, it
is important to note that the operational definition of
“bisexual” included also individuals reporting low levels of
sexual interest in same-sex individuals. These individuals
might consider themselves heterosexual or “bicurious” and
might differ from individuals who more precisely fit the term
“bisexual.” Given the lack of research on age preferences in
bisexual individuals, the results of the current provide novel,
but tentative, information.
The current study was conducted in Finland, a modern,
industrialized society high in gender equality (World Eco-
nomic Forum, 2015). Studies have shown that populations
with high gender equality tend to be low in sexual dimorph-
ism (e.g., Manning, Fink, & Trivers, 2014). In the current
context of age preferences, this could mean that on average
the difference between men and women is smaller than in
other, less equal, populations. At the same time, there is
evidence of women maturing earlier in more industrialized
(vs. less industrialized) societies (Parent et al., 2003). This
would also mean that Finnish women tend to show physical
signs of maturation at a relatively young age. This could
mean that Finnish men, on average, are interested in
slightly younger women than men are in less industrialized
and less gender equal societies. With this in mind, cross-
cultural data on the development of age preferences across
the life span could elucidate potential variability over dif-
ferent social contexts.
The current study focused on sexual interest. Romantic
interest or preferences for long-term partners were not mea-
sured. This is important to consider, because reproduction in
most cases occur within the stability of a long-term pair bond
(e.g., Gray & Garcia, 2013). This means that the choice of a
long-term partner is likely a more important evolutionary factor
to consider when uncovering the selection pressure on age-
related sexual preferences.
A final thing to consider is that age is only one of many
characteristics evaluated in a potential partner. In fact, age is
likely not very important in itself but acts as a proxy for several
other important factors. These factors include, for example,
remaining life span, fertility (in women), health, and status.
Age also affects other aspects of sexuality. For example, sexual
desire decreases as humans grow older and more so in women
compared to men (e.g., DeLamater & Sill, 2004). This age-
related sex discrepancy in sexual desire in older men and
women (compared to young men and women), with sexual
desire being higher in men compared to women, could
drive men to “strategically” widen their age limits as they
grow older.
Limitations of the Current Study
One limitation in our study is a possible skewing of data
regarding youngest actual partner for our youngest
respondents. Given that the mean age of first intercourse
in Finland is approximately 17.5 years for both sexes
(Johansson et al., 2013), respondents below 22 years of age
are likely to report that their youngest partner during the
last 5 years was, on average, 17 years old. These observa-
tions, however, represent the true limit and do not invalidate
our conclusions.
It is also important to note that we did not include men
or women older than 50 years of age in the current study.
Although there is relatively little data on age preferences
in older age-groups, we predict that the difference
between ages continues to grow as men and women age.
Nevertheless, this prediction is not tested in the current
study, and we hope future studies are designed to test
this claim.
Conclusions and Future Directions
The results of this study indicate that men’s and women’s
sexual age preferences develop differently. As women grow
older, age limits regarding both younger and older sex part-
ners follow their own aging. As men grow older, they
become interested in older individuals but maintain an inter-
est in younger individuals. Homosexual men are more likely
than heterosexual men to convert a preference for young
individuals into actual sexual behavior, supporting female-
choice theory.
We also found that homosexual male participants differed
from other male participants regarding the youngest consid-
ered age. Although this difference was small, this collateral
finding could suggest that men interested in women self-
modulate their preferences to better fit the interest of their
potential female partners. This finding is tentative and studies
designed to test this hypothesis are necessary before any con-
clusions can be drawn.
Although participants’ own age explained a large propor-
tion of the variance in age preferences and sexual behavior,
we note that an interesting aspect remains unexplored:
Between-individual variation (while controlling for age dif-
ferences) in understanding the differences in both prefer-
ences and behavior have not received a lot of attention in
the literature.
