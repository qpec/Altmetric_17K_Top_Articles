Abstract
The medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, has been implicated in social memory. 
However, it remains unknown which parts of these brain regions and their circuits hold social 
memory. Here, we show that ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) neurons of a mouse and their 
projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell play a necessary and sufficient role in social 
memory. Both the proportion of activated vCA1 cells and the strength and stability of the 
responding cells are greater in response to a familiar mouse than to a novel mouse. Optogenetic 
reactivation of vCA1 neurons that respond to the familiar mouse enabled memory retrieval and the 
association of these neurons with unconditioned stimuli. Thus, vCA1 neurons and their NAc shell 
projections are a component of the storage site of social memory.
The ability to recognize and memorize familiar conspecifics (social memory) is crucial for 
animals that exhibit social interactions (1, 2). Lesion and recording studies in humans and 
monkeys have suggested that the medial temporal lobe or the hippocampus play an essential 
role in social memory (3–6). In mice, most early lesion or recording studies concluded that 
the hippocampus is dispensable for recognizing a familiar conspecific (7–9), while a few 
recent studies suggested the contrary (10–12). Although these human and animal studies 
identified brain areas important for social memory, the precise cellular populations storing 
this type of memory and their essential circuits are unknown.
The intrinsic pattern of connectivity in the hippocampus is fairly invariable along the 
longitudinal axis (13) across many species (14). However, the afferent and efferent 
connectivity along this axis changes from one end to the other, suggesting that dorsal and 
ventral hippocampus of rodents (corresponding to posterior and anterior hippocampus, 
respectively, of primates) may have distinct functions (14, 15). It is well established that the

 rodent dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) plays an essential role in episodic memory (15). In 
contrast, the memory function of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is poorly known. In this 
study, we generated a transgenic mouse line, Trpc4-Cre, to investigate the potential role and 
physiological characteristics of the pyramidal neurons in the CA1 subfield of the ventral 
hippocampus (vCA1) in social memory.
Mice naturally spend more time interacting with a novel mouse rather than a familiar one 
(16); social memory can be quantified by measuring the relative interaction durations with a 
novel and a familiar mouse under free choice conditions (social discrimination test or SDT) 
(Fig. 1, A and B). This ability to socially discriminate between the novel and familiar mice 
persisted for 30 min following a familiarization session, but disappeared by 24 h (Fig. 1C). 
In order to investigate the potential role of vHPC and dHPC in social memory, we targeted 
bilateral injections of AAV8-CaMKII:eArchT-EYFP and optic fiber implants to vCA1 or 
dorsal CA1 (dCA1) of wild-type mice (Fig. 1D). Expression of eArchT-EYFP was abundant 
in vCA1 or dCA1, although it was also observed to a lesser extent in CA3 and the dentate 
gyrus (DG) (Fig. 1, E and F). Optogenetic cell body inhibition of vHPC but not dHPC 
resulted in a deficit in SDT (Fig. 1, G, H, O, and P). In the resident-intruder test (Fig. 1I and 
fig. S1), optogenetic inhibition of vHPC but not dHPC increased the sniffing duration 
towards a familiar intruder with no effect when a novel intruder was used (Fig. 1, J and K).
To identify downstream brain region(s) involved in social memory, AAV9-
TRE:channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-EYFP was injected into vCA1 of c-fos:tTA mice to label 
neurons activated by social interaction (17, 18). NAc shell, olfactory bulb (OB), and 
basolateral amygdala (BLA) were the major targets of the social interaction-specific vCA1 
neuronal projections (fig. S2). Moreover, retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB)-
Alexa555 injection into NAc, OB, or BLA labeled vCA1 but not dCA1 neurons (fig. S3). 
We then examined whether any of these projections are necessary for social memory by 
bilaterally injecting AAV8-CaMKII:eArchT-EYFP into vHPC and then optogenetically 
inhibiting axonal terminals of the vCA1 neurons in the respective target areas while the mice 
went through SDT (Fig. 1, L to N, Q to S, and fig. S4). vHPC-NAc projections, but not 
vHPC-OB or vHPC-BLA, were essential for social discrimination behavior.
To more rigorously establish the functional role of the vCA1-NAc connection, we generated 
a CA1 pyramidal cell-specific Cre mouse line, Trpc4-Cre that covers both vCA1 and dCA1 
(fig. S5, and Methods). Using Trpc4-Cre mice, vCA1 excitatory pyramidal neurons were 
selectively targeted by injecting AAV9-hsyn:DIO-eArchT-EYFP into vCA1 (Fig. 2, A and 
B, and fig. S6). We confirmed that the vCA1 neurons specifically project to the NAc shell 
but not to the NAc core, as identified by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining (Fig. 2C). 
Further, CTB injection into NAc labeled the Trpc4-expressing deep layer (vCA1d), but not 
the superficial layer (vCA1s) pyramidal cells in vCA1 (Fig. 2B). Bilateral injections of 
AAV9-hsyn:DIO-eArchT-EYFP into the vCA1 of Trpc4-Cre mice and optogenetic 
inhibition of vCA1 cell body (Fig. 2, D and H) or its axonal terminals in NAc (Fig. 2, F, G, 
and J) resulted in a SDT deficit similar to that observed by vHPC-NAc inhibition (compare 
Fig. 2G with Fig. 1L). Optogenetic inhibition of vCA1 cell body during the familiarization 
period also led to a similar SDT defect (fig. S8). The possibility that these deficits are due to 
inhibition of dorsal CA2 (dCA2) activity is excluded because dCA2 is unlabeled with

 eArchT-EYFP in these mice (fig. S6C). dCA1 cell body inhibition was carried out using 
Wfs1-Cre mouse line expressing Cre in dCA1 but not in vCA1 or dCA2 (fig. S9) (19), 
which showed no deficit in SDT (Fig. 2, E and I).
Inhibition of vCA1-NAc shell projections in Trpc4-Cre mice only during the interaction 
with a novel mouse did not affect SDT (Fig. 2K, middle, and fig. S7A), whereas inhibition 
only during interaction with a familiar mouse disrupted social discrimination between the 
two mice (Fig. 2K, right, and fig. S7A). In contrast, when a pair of novel mice (Fig. 2L and 
fig. S7B), novel and familiar objects (fig. S10A), or novel and familiar contexts (fig. S10B) 
were used, there was no effect of vCA1-NAc shell inhibition.
We performed SDT using Trpc4-Cre mice expressing AAV9-EF1α:DIO-ChR2-EYFP in 
vCA1 while stimulating vCA1-NAc shell projections (Fig. 2, M and N, and fig. S7). 
Optogenetic activation of vCA1-NAc shell terminals during social interaction with a novel 
mouse disrupted SDT (Fig. 2M, middle, and fig. S7C). With a pair of novel mice as the 
targets, stimulating vCA1-NAc shell projections during interactions with one of the novel 
mice greatly reduced the sniffing duration of that mouse compared to the other novel mouse 
(Fig. 2N, and fig. S7D). Optogenetic activation of vCA1-NAc shell terminal during 
interaction with a familiar mouse had no effect in SDT (Fig. 2M, right, and fig. S7C). Light 
activation did not affect SDT in the EYFP control groups (fig. S11, A and B). With novel 
objects in place of mice, interactions of the test-mouse were not affected by activation of the 
vCA1-NAc shell projections (fig. S11C). These results suggest that increased activation of 
the vCA1-NAc shell projections while the test mouse was in the novel mouse domain 
disrupted the discriminatory social behavior by making the test mouse perceive the novel 
mouse as familiar.
In order to monitor the activity of vCA1 cells before and after the familiarization of a 
conspecific mouse, AAV5-hsyn:DIO-GCaMP6f was injected into the vCA1 of Trpc4-Cre 
mice and implanted a microprism grin lens targeting the pyramidal cell layer in vCA1 (Fig. 
3, A and B, and Methods) (20, 21). Ca2+ events in vCA1 neurons (Fig. 3, D and E) were 
recorded during exposure to two novel mice (A and B) in two consecutive 5 min sessions 
with mouse-A and mouse-B in counterbalanced positions, followed by a 5 min control 
session with no mice (Before Group). The test mice were subjected to 3 day-long or 2 h-long 
familiarization with mouse-A and the recording sequence was repeated after 30 min or 24 h 
separation (After-1 Group) (Fig. 3F). For each neuron, we calculated a “Preference Score” 
based on the head position of the test-mouse during each recorded Ca2+ event, and identified 
vCA1 cells that exhibited selective activation by mouse-A or mouse-B (Fig. 3G and fig. 
S12). There was a significant increase in the proportion of mouse-A neurons after 3 days or 
2 h familiarization to mouse-A (Fig. 3H). In contrast, there was no effect of familiarization 
on the proportion of cells active around mouse sampling locations in control sessions (No 
mouse). Similarly, familiarization had no effect on the proportion of mouse-A neurons in 
dCA1 of Wfs1-Cre transgenic mice (Fig. 3, C and H).
We determined the Preference Score of mouse-A neurons in Before Group and After-1 
Group as well as After-2 Group that had a second 3 day familiarization. The Preference 
Scores of individual mouse-A neurons were not correlated between Before Group and 
Okuyama et al.

 After-1 Group while these score were correlated between After-1 Group and After-2 Group 
(Fig. 3, I to L). In addition, mouse-A neurons of After-1 Group showed an increase in Ca2+ 
event probability around the mouse-A sniffing area while mouse-A neurons did not show 
such an increase in Ca2+ probability in the mouse B sniffing area. (Fig. 3M). Although the 
individual mouse-A neurons were still significantly activated by mouse-A (Fig. 3, N and O), 
Ca2+ event probability of these neurons in mouse-A area was reduced when the recordings 
were conducted after 24 h separation following familiarization (Fig. 3P).
The c-fos-tTA/TRE system permits labeling and manipulations of memory engram cells (17, 
24). We used this technology to characterize mouse-A neurons. First, we injected AAV9-
TRE:fluorescent timer (FT)-Slow into the vCA1 of c-fos:tTA mice and induced expression 
of FT-Slow in neurons activated by social interaction (Fig. 4A). The fluorescence of FT-
Slow naturally changes over time (22), from blue (pseudo-green) 12 h after induction to red 
72 h after induction (Fig. 4, A and B, and fig. S13). Test-mice interacted with mouse-A 
twice, or with mouse-A and then mouse-B, with a 72 h separation (Fig. 4, C and D). The 
proportions of reactivated cells with an overlap of red and blue signal was significantly 
higher in test-mice exposed to the same mouse-A twice, versus those exposed to mouse-A 
followed by mouse-B (Fig. 4E, and fig. S13). A similar quantitative analysis of vCA1 
reactivation using H2B-EGFP (nuclear localized EGFP) and c-Fos expression showed 
comparable results (fig. S14).
Second, we targeted injection of AAV9-TRE:ChR2-EYFP and optic fibers to vCA1 of c-
fos:tTA mice and labeled with ChR2 vCA1 cells that were activated by 2 h exposure to a 
mouse-A while OFF-Dox (Fig. 4, F and G, and fig. S2). As expected, social memory was 
absent in the SDT conducted after 24 h separation (Fig. 4H, left), but was present when blue 
light was shone to the whole test box (Fig. 4H, right). Control experiments conducted with 
no ChR2 mice (Fig. 4I) or a pair of novel mice during SDT (fig. S15A) did not show social 
memory. Restricting blue light to mouse-A area but not mouse-B area, also caused the 
restoration of social memory (Fig. 4J). These results suggest that even after social memory 
cannot be retrieved by natural cues the memory engram cells for the familiar mouse are 
sufficiently retained and can be reactivated optogenetically for memory retrieval (17, 23). 
Indeed, the proportion of mouse-A neurons reactivated by blue light is much greater than 
that reactivated by natural cues (i.e. mouse-A) after 3 day separation (compare fig. S16G and 
Fig. 4E). We further investigated the parameters that affect social memory, including the 
post-familiarization separation periods, the proportion of reactivated familiar mouse-A 
neurons, the nature of recall cues (natural vs. optogenetic) and the strength of the 
reactivation methods (figs. S14 and S16). The data indicate that optogenetic stimulation is 
more effective than natural stimulation in re-activating memory engram cells, and that a 
certain minimum threshold level of reactivation of mouse-A neurons will have to be reached 
in order for social memory to be expressed in the SDT paradigm.
Third, we employed the memory inception protocol (Fig. 4K) (24). After 24 h separation 
ChR2-labeled mouse-A neurons were light-activated simultaneously with foot-shock 
delivery (i.e. negative US) or cocaine administration (i.e. positive US). The test mouse 
exhibited avoidance or approach behavior toward mouse-A, respectively, in SDT conducted 
the following day (Fig. 4, K to N). Negative control groups with no ChR2 (i.e. AAV9-

 TRE:EYFP alone) (Fig. 4, O and P) or no-US (fig. S15B) did not show any behavioral 
alterations. No avoidance or approaching behavior was observed when two novel mice (B 
and B′) were used as the target mice during the test (fig. S15, C and D). AAV9-TRE:ChR2-
EYFP injection into dCA1 of c-fos:tTA mice did not lead to memory inception (fig. S17). 
The possibility that the observed optogenetic recall or memory inception is due to memory 
held in adjacent dCA2 is excluded because no labeling of dCA2 cells with ChR2 could be 
observed under our experimental conditions (fig. S17, D to F).
We have established that vCA1 and its projections to NAc shell play a necessary and 
sufficient role in social memory in the mouse. Furthermore, we have provided evidence 
supporting that vCA1 pyramidal cells hold the memory of a familiar mouse; a population of 
vCA1 pyramidal cells are activated by exposure to a familiar mouse, a large fraction of these 
cells are reactivated by re-exposure to the same mouse, and optogenetic re-activation of the 
vCA1 cells previously activated by exposure to a familiar mouse elicited recall of the 
specific social memory as monitored by a social discrimination test. Thus, the vCA1 cells 
activated by the exposure to a familiar mouse satisfy the criteria to be met by engram cells 
for a specific memory (25). It is interesting that this recall of the social memory by light can 
occur even after the mice have fallen into an amnesic state. This indicates that the specific 
social memory information is retained in the specific vCA1 cell population during at least 
one day after encoding but that natural recall cues are not strong enough to reactivate these 
cells for memory recall; in contrast, the 20 Hz blue light is stronger and reactivates the 
engram cells above the threshold necessary for recall. This interpretation of light-mediated 
recall of the social memory is supported by the inception experiment; the social memory is 
retained in the amnesic mice and the light reactivated engram serves as a CS and becomes 
associated with a high valence US (footshocks or cocaine) to evoke avoidance or preference 
behavior.
The present study helped resolve the controversy (7–9) regarding necessity of mouse 
hippocampus for social memory and corroborates previous observations made in primates 
(4–6). In macaques, a large population of neurons in the anterior hippocampus responded to 
socially relevant cues such as faces and voices of individuals (6). In human medial temporal 
lobe, including the anterior hippocampus, there are cells that respond more to famous or 
personally relevant people than to unfamiliar people (4, 5). The overall results suggest 
evolutionary conservation of the role of the hippocampal areas as the sites of social memory.
Recent studies have shown that dCA2 is critical for sociocognitive memory processing (10, 
11, 26). dCA2 neurons have longitudinal rostro-caudal projections to vCA1 (fig. S18) (27, 
28) and connect with the deep layer of CA1 more strongly than with the superficial layer 
(28). It is thus possible that the dCA2-vCA1d-NAc circuit composes the engram cell 
ensemble pathway for social memory (25). However, it is also possible that the role of dCA2 
in social memory is to convey to vCA1d appropriately processed and socially relevant cues, 
rather than holding memory information per se.
Compared to other forms of episodic memory, social memory lasts no more than a few hours 
(Fig. 1C) under laboratory conditions (29, 30), although it can be prolonged to a week by 
vasopressin release, or to 24 h by group housing (12, 29, 31). We demonstrated by 
Okuyama et al.

 optogenetics that the engram cells for social memory formed in a laboratory environment 
can be retained in vCA1 for at least two days. Thus, the relatively short duration of social 
memory is apparently due to inefficient retrieval rather than failed retention of the memory. 
It would be interesting to test the hypothesis that increased vasopressin and/or group housing 
prolongs social memory duration by promoting the retrieval process.
Overall, our study establishes vCA1 and its NAc projections as a site of social memory and 
provides insights and clues to the neuronal mechanisms underlying this important form of 
memory (fig. S19).
