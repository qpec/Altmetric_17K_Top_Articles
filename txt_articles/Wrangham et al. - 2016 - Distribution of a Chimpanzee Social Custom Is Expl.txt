Summary 
 
High-arm grooming is a form of chimpanzee grooming in which two 
individuals mutually groom while each raising one arm. Palm-to-palm-clasping 
(PPC) is a distinct style of high-arm grooming in which the grooming partners clasp 
each other’s raised palms. In wild communities samples of at least 100 observed 
dyads grooming with raised hands showed PPC frequencies varying from <5% (M-
group, Mahale) to >30% dyads grooming (Kanyawara, Kibale), and in a large free-
ranging sanctuary group the frequency reached >80% dyads (Group 1, Chimfunshi) 
[1, 2]. Because between-community differences in frequency of PPC apparently 
result from social learning, are stable across generations and last for at least 9 years, 
they are thought to be cultural, but the mechanism of transmission is unknown [2]. 
Here we examine factors responsible for individual variation in PPC frequency 
within a single wild community. We found that in the Kanyawara community 
(Kibale, Uganda) adults of both sexes varied widely in their PPC frequency (from 
<10% to >50%), and did not converge on a central group tendency. However 
frequencies of PPC were highly consistent within matrilines, indicating that 
individuals maintained lifelong fidelity to the grooming style of their mothers. 
Matrilineal inheritance of socially learned behaviors has previously been reported 
for tool-using in chimpanzees[3], and in the vocal and feeding behavior of cetaceans 
[4, 5]. Our evidence indicates that matrilineal inheritance can be sufficiently strong 
in nonhuman primates to account for longterm differences in community traditions.

Results and Discussion 
 
Hand-clasp grooming was originally defined as a form of mutual grooming in 
which each partner holds his or her hand above the head while clasping the other’s raised 
hand, wrist or arm [6]. However the term “hand-clasp grooming” has become 
inappropriate because it has been used to include all cases in which two groomers hold 
their arms high and in physical contact, regardless of whether there is any clasping (Fig. 
1). To reduce confusion we use the term “high-arm mutual grooming” (high-arm 
grooming for short) for episodes of mutual grooming when two partners sit facing each 
other, each holds an elbow higher than either of their shoulders, and their raised hand, 
wrist or arm is touching the similarly raised hand, wrist or arm of the partner. In three of 
eleven wild populations high-arm grooming is absent, suggesting that elsewhere it is 
socially learned [7] (see SI). In support of social learning, the western and eastern sub-
species each include at least one population in which the pattern is present, and at least 
one in which it is absent [7]; high-arm grooming has been observed to be socially 
propagated in captivity[8]; and wild mothers sometimes mold their young offspring’s 
high-arm grooming behavior [9].  
Within communities that practice high-arm grooming there is little evidence of 
variation in how often individuals use it. However substantial variation has been reported 
in the style of grooming used. Following McGrew et al. (2001) we define a “palm-to-
palm-clasp” (PPC) as the sub-category of high-arm grooming in which the hands are 
clasped with mutual palmar contact (Fig. 1a) [10]; and %PPC is the proportion of an 
individual’s high-arm grooming bouts featuring palm-to-palm-clasping. Our aim is to 
  
5 
understand how and why individuals vary in their tendency to use PPC during high-arm 
grooming. 
We studied chimpanzees in the Kanyawara community of Kibale National Park, 
western Uganda. All adults engaged frequently in high-arm grooming (Table S1), and all 
also sometimes performed PPC, albeit with varying frequency (Table S2). In 2011-2015 a 
total of 35 members of the Kanyawara community were photographed in 932 
independent bouts of high-arm grooming. Unless stated otherwise we restricted analysis 
to the 18 individuals for whom at least 40 episodes of high-arm contact grooming were 
photographed and for which both raised hands were intact (mean ± standard deviation = 
76.5 ± 28.6 per individual, range 42-128). Across individuals %PPC ranged from 6.8% to 
57.8% (mean ± standard deviation 32.6% ± 18.9%).  
One hypothesis for the distribution of PPC values is that individuals would show 
conformity, defined as adopting the preferred strategy of the majority of group members 
[11]. In accordance with the conformity hypothesis we would predict a single peak of 
values. In contrast to this expectation, individual %PPC values were distributed 
bimodally, peaking in the ranges of 0-20% and 40-60% PPC, either side of the median 
value of 35.1% (Fig. 2). Given that chimpanzees are male philopatric and have therefore 
spent their lives in this community, whereas most females immigrate as adolescents, the 
conformity hypothesis suggests that adult males would have a more centralized tendency 
than females. However Fig. 2 shows that males varied widely, with no evidence of a sex 
difference in variance. To find out whether duration of exposure to the group influenced 
%PPC we examined whether younger individuals or more recent immigrants had %PPC 
values that were furthest from the group median. We found no correlation between 
  
6 
number of years of exposure to the group (from age 10 onwards) and difference between 
an individual’s %PPC score and the group median (Pearson r = 0.14, n = 18, p ns). In 
sum we found no evidence that individuals converged in their frequencies of palm-to-
palm-clasping. 
 
We therefore considered factors that might explain individual variation in %PPC. 
Males spent a higher proportion of time engaged in high-arm grooming than females did 
(median number of minutes per day in high-arm grooming: males 2.1 (n = 16 
individuals), females 0.7 (n = 16; Mann-Whitney U = 25, z = 3.86, P < 0.001). However 
because this sex difference was due entirely to a sex difference in the rate of mutual 
grooming, it had no impact on %PPC. First, the rate of high-arm grooming as a 
percentage of all mutual grooming did not differ between females and males (females 
44.9% ± 25.9%, n = 16; males 48.8% ± 17.9%, n = 16; Mann-Whitney U = 89.5, z = 
0.93, P n.s.; Table S1). Thus the sex difference in time spent in high-arm grooming was 
explicable entirely by a sex difference in rates of mutual grooming. Second %PPC did 
not differ between males and females (male mean 32.0% ± 17.3%, n = 13; female 34.1% 
± 24.7%, n = 5 Mann-Whitney U = 31, z = 0.099, P = .92; Table S2). There was also no 
relationship between %PPC and age (r = .03, n = 18, P ns, range 9 – ~58 years; Table 
S2). Thus %PPC was not related to either sex or age. 
A higher tendency for palm-to-palm-clasping could in theory result from some 
individuals being more motivated to engage in high-arm grooming. To test this idea we 
indexed motivational strength by two factors that might relate positively to the intensity 
of interest in grooming, i.e. the proportion of time spent in high-arm grooming, and the 
duration of episodes of high-arm-grooming. First, among individuals with at least 10 
  
7 
hours of focal observation for every hour of the day from 0700h to 1800h, there was no 
relationship between the frequency of high-arm grooming and %PPC (both sexes: r = -
.101, n = 18, P = 0.69; males only: r = -0.114, n = 13, P = 0.71). Second, the periods 
during which dyads remained in a given high-arm grooming posture varied from 3 to 155 
seconds (overall mean 46.7 s ± 27.4 s, n = 249 episodes). For adult males whose duration 
of high-arm grooming was recorded at least 20 times, we found no relationship between 
duration of high-arm grooming and the frequency of engaging in PPC (r = -.24, n = 7, P 
ns). Thus neither of our potential indices of motivational interest in high-arm grooming 
showed any relationship to %PPC. 
With regard to social factors, %PPC did not differ between dyads in which the 
partner was a close matrilineal kin (mother, offspring or sibling) and those that were 
unrelated (%PPC in kin dyads 37.3% ± 34.8%, n = 12; non-kin dyads 31.2% ± 24.3%, n 
= 13; dyads with at least 10 photographs, Mann-Whitney z = 0.027, P ns). We also 
attempted to test whether %PPC was related to affiliative relationships between partners. 
We assessed the influence of strength of social relationship among 12 adult males by 
comparing %PPC with a combined association index (CAI). The CAI measured a dyad’s 
deviation from the mean value across three independent indices of association, i.e. time 
spent in the same party, the frequency of the two individuals being within 5 meters of 
each other when they were in the same party, and the frequency of being nearest 
neighbors, given that they were within 5 meters of each other [12]. For the 13 male-male 
dyads with at least 10 photographed episodes there was no hint of a positive correlation 
between %PPC and CAI (r = -0.31, n = 13).

Previous research has shown that young chimpanzees learn how to use feeding 
tools partly from their mothers, leading to similarities in tool-using behavior [3]. 
Similarly there is evidence for maternal influence on the ontogeny of high-arm grooming. 
Thus in Mahale, mothers tend to initiate such grooming with their offspring, remain their 
only high-arm grooming partner for up to 7 years, and have been seen to mold their 
young’s high-arm posture [9]. We therefore examined maternal influences on %PPC. We 
found that mothers accounted for more than 80% of an offspring’s high-arm grooming 
until the offspring reached 12 years old, i.e. early adulthood. To test the strength of 
maternal influences we compared the PPC prevalence exhibited by all available adults or 
adolescents (those at least ten years old, with at least 10 photographs of high-arm 
grooming, where matrilineal kinship was known). Fig. 3 shows that individual 
differences in %PPC were closely related to matrilineal relationships (intra-class 
correlation = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.84 P < 0.0001). For example % PPC scores for three 
individuals in one matriline were all below 11%, while in another they were all above 
50%. In two cases the matriarch had died several years earlier (deaths: PU in 2003, LP in 
2004), but in each case the remaining adult offspring resembled each other closely in 
their %PPC tendency (Fig. 3). 
 
Family differences in PPC tendencies were particularly pronounced when 
individuals groomed within matrilines. When chimpanzees high-arm groomed with 
mothers, offspring or siblings, mean %PPC within matrilines varied over an order of 
magnitude, from 8.9% ± 4.2% (the OU family) to 91.6% ± 1.1% (the LP family) 
(Kruskal-Wallis K = 11.9, df = 4, P < 0.02) (Table 1). Even when grooming with 
individuals from other matrilines, which would often require at least one member of the 
  
9 
dyad to adjust his/her grooming style, differences among family tendencies remained. For 
example comparing episodes when they groomed outside their matrilines, the five 
members of the two matrilines showing the lowest %PPC (OU, PU) all engaged less 
frequently in PPC than any of the six members of the two matrilines showing the highest 
%PPC (AL, LP) (Table 1). 
 
An intriguing question concerns the probability of palm-to-palm-clasping when 
individuals from high-%PPC and low-%PPC families groomed with each other, since this 
context required one of the individuals to abandon its usual style. A predictable tendency 
for a class of individuals (such as low-%PPC individuals, or those who have a low 
dominance rank) to adopt the style of their partner in these circumstances would suggest 
a mechanism by which horizontal transmission of grooming style could occur. For 
instance the mechanism could be a rule such as: “if your partner is dominant, allow him 
or her to initiate and then accept their grooming style”.  
We identified high-%PPC individuals as those with the top ten %PPC scores 
regardless of who their partner was (n = 3 females, 7 males; %PPC score range 35.7 – 
62.0%). To find individuals who tended to have a frequent form of high-arm grooming 
contact other than PPC, we classified all contacts as palm-to-palm, palm-to-wrist, palm-
to-forearm, wrist-to-wrist, wrist-to-forearm, forearm-to-forearm, or another combination 
(e.g. involving the fingers or the back of the hand) (SI, Table 2). The second most 
frequent form was wrist-to-wrist (WW), defined as wrists providing the main contact for 
both partners. We identified high-%WW individuals as those with the top ten %WW 
scores (n = 1 female, 9 males; %WW score range 18.6 – 41.4%).  
  
10 
For 14 dyads with at least 10 high-arm grooming episodes involving one high-
%PPC partner (>60% PPC) and one high-%WW partner (>35% wrist-wrist contact), the 
dyad sometimes used PPC and sometimes did not. The sample size was small but no 
overall pattern was noted, and age, sex and social dominance played no detectable 
influence. For example out of 9 dyads in which one partner “won” more often (in the 
sense that the pair adopted that partner’s most frequent type of contact), the older partner 
“won” in four cases and “lost” in five cases. Thus currently we have no evidence of any 
horizontal transmission biases. 
 
In high-arm grooming the angles of the wrist and elbow can vary between bouts 
[1]. In most cases of palm-to-palm-clasping (64.2%) the elevated arms of both partners 
were straight, i.e. the angle of the elbow was judged to be 150 o -180o (Fig. 1). This raised 
the possibility that individual or family preference for the palm-to-palm-clasp contact 
was associated with, and could be due to, a preference for keeping an arm straight. 
However, we found no indication that matrilines varied in their tendency to groom with 
straight as opposed to flexed arms. For individuals with >40 photographs the median 
percentage of high-arm grooming with two straight arms was 45.3%, and within every 
matriline at least one member was above, and one below, the median. Variation among 
individuals in %PPC was therefore due to variation in the preference for palm-to-palm-
clasping more than for holding arms straight. 
 
The high consistency of %PPC within matrilines (Figure 3, Table 1) indicates 
relatively faithful transmission. Current evidence indicates a role for social learning, but 
genetic influences are also plausible since they have not been ruled out for behavioral 
variants among chimpanzee communities even where some degree of social learning is 
  
11 
known to occur [13, 14]. Comparison with patrilineal relationships will eventually afford 
a test of genetic influences. 
 
Why matrilines varied is unknown. Ultimately we assume that differences come 
from non-faithful transmission, i.e. a daughter adopting a style other than her mother’s. 
Possible sources of such ‘cultural mutation’ could include injuries to a mother that 
constrain the nature of her hand or arm contact, or a female orphan adopting the PPC 
style of non-kin. Alternatively, in theory some individuals might develop strong personal 
preferences that lead them to reject their mother’s style.  
 
Shifts in average PPC tendency within a community are expected from various 
demographic events. Mothers with many daughters who breed in their natal community, 
as can occur in Gombe, Tanzania [15], will disproportionately transmit their style over at 
least two generations. In contrast, mothers who have only sons, or whose daughters all 
breed in other communities (as happens routinely in chimpanzees [16]) will have an 
impact over one generation only.  Changes in the group average are therefore expected 
across generations. 
Chimpanzees have sometimes been suggested to change their behavioral styles so 
as “to aid social cohesion and the maintenance of group dynamics” [17-19] (quote is from 
p. 1200 in ref. 17). In support of that idea, in two cases (nut-smashing, ant-dipping) 
neighboring communities of wild chimpanzees have been shown to use tools in different 
ways for solving what appeared to be ecologically identical problems [20, 21]. If palm-
to-palm-clasping signals social affiliation, however, our evidence suggests that it does so 
only at the level of the matrilineal family. 
  
12 
Results support the role of individual conservatism as an explanation for the 
frequency distribution of palm-to-palm-clasping, and they provide the first observational 
data from the wild in support of experiments showing that when incentives are low, 
chimpanzees tend to maintain their first-learned strategy rather than conform to the group 
[22]. Individuals learning a novel technique of tool use in captivity showed a similar 
tendency [23]. Whether the same mechanism accounts for the distribution of PPC 
elsewhere in the wild is unknown. In the Chimfunshi sanctuary, where community 
members have no longterm matrilineal lineages, %PPC reaches more than 80% [2]. This 
suggests that other mechanisms are possible. The importance of matrilineal inheritance 
for cultural traditions in general is therefore an interesting open question.
