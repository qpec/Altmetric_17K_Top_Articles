In Brief
FGF21 has well-established beneficial
metabolic effects. Talukdar et al. now
extend this repertoire and reveal that
FGF21 also suppresses sweet and
alcohol preference in mice, and sweet
preference in monkeys, by acting on the
CNS. These effects are associated with
decreased dopamine, a key
neurotransmitter used in reward
pathways.

SUMMARY
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone
induced by various metabolic stresses, including
ketogenic and high-carbohydrate diets, that regu-
lates energy homeostasis. In humans, SNPs in and
around the FGF21 gene have been associated with
macronutrient preference, including carbohydrate,
fat, and protein intake. Here we show that FGF21
administration markedly reduces sweet and alcohol
preference in mice and sweet preference in cynomol-
gus monkeys. In mice, these effects require the
FGF21 co-receptor b-Klotho in the central nervous
system and correlate with reductions in dopamine
concentrations in the nucleus accumbens. Since
analogs of FGF21 are currently undergoing clinical
evaluation for the treatment of obesity and type 2 dia-
betes, our findings raise the possibility that FGF21
administration could affect nutrient preference and
other reward behaviors in humans.
INTRODUCTION
FGF21 is induced in liver in response to fasting and other forms
of metabolic stress including ketogenic and high-carbohydrate
diets (Badman et al., 2007; Dushay et al., 2015; Inagaki et al.,
2007; Sa
´ nchez et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2015). FGF21 in turn reg-
ulates diverse aspects of energy homeostasis, including hepatic
fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, circadian behavior, growth,
and female reproduction (Owen et al., 2015). Pharmacologically,
FGF21 causes weight loss and improves insulin sensitivity in
obese mice, monkeys, and humans (Gimeno and Moller, 2014).
Long-acting analogs of FGF21 are currently in clinical trials for
the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.
FGF21 acts through a cell-surface receptor composed of a
conventional FGF receptor in complex with b-Klotho, a single-
pass transmembrane protein (Owen et al., 2015). FGF21 crosses
the blood-brain barrier (Hsuchou et al., 2007) and exerts many of
its actions, including its effects on growth, female reproduction,
and weight loss, by acting on its cognate receptor in the CNS
(Bookout et al., 2013; Douris et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2014;
Owen et al., 2013, 2014; Sarruf et al., 2010). Among its central
actions, FGF21 induces corticotropin-releasing factor and sup-
presses arginine vasopressin expression in the hypothalamus
(Bookout et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2014; Owen et al., 2013, 2014).
In humans, SNPs in and around the FGF21 gene are associ-
ated with changes in macronutrient preference, including in-
creases in carbohydrate consumption and decreases in fat and
protein intake (Chu et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2013). These find-
ings raise the possibility of additional effects of FGF21 on the
brain. In this report, we examine the effect of FGF21 on sweet
and alcohol preference in mice and monkeys.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Since FGF21 is induced by carbohydrates in rodents and hu-
mans (Dushay et al., 2015; Sa
´ nchez et al., 2009), and SNPs in
the FGF21 gene are associated with carbohydrate intake in hu-
mans (Chu et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2013), we investigated
whether chronic FGF21 exposure affects sweet preference.
Two-bottle preference assays with water and either 3%
sucrose or 0.2% saccharin (Krishnan et al., 2007; Tordoff and
Bachmanov, 2003) were performed using wild-type (WT) and
Fgf21-transgenic (Tg) mice expressing supraphysiological con-
centrations of FGF21 (Inagaki et al., 2007). Saccharin was
included to eliminate the potentially confounding effect of caloric
content. As expected, WT mice showed a strong preference for
drinking water sweetened with either sucrose or saccharin (Fig-
ures 1A and 1B, Table S1). Notably, the Tg(Fgf21) mice had sig-
nificant decreases in both sucrose and saccharin preference
(Figures 1A and 1B).

 To determine whether FGF21 acts on the CNS to regulate
sweet preference, we administered recombinant FGF21 or
vehicle by osmotic minipump to groups of control mice with
floxed b-Klotho alleles (Klbfl/fl) or mice specifically lacking
b-Klotho in the CNS (KlbCamk2a), and two-bottle saccharin
preference tests were performed. FGF21 strongly suppressed
saccharin preference in Klbfl/fl mice but had no effect in KlbCamk2a
mice (Figure 1C, Table S2). As reported (Camporez et al., 2013),
administration of recombinant FGF21 increased total fluid
intake, and this effect required b-Klotho in the CNS (Table S2).
In contrast, total fluid intake was unchanged in Tg(Fgf21)
compared to control mice (Table S1). The reason for this
difference between Tg FGF21 overexpression and recombinant
FGF21 administration on fluid intake is not known. Nevertheless,
FGF21 decreased sweet preference in both contexts.
In additional two-bottle preference tests, FGF21 had no
effect on preference for 1% sunflower oil (data not shown)
or quinine (Figure 1D), indicating that FGF21 does not affect
responses to fatty acids or bitter taste. FGF21 administration
also had no effect on either tail-suspension or forced-swim
tests, both standard measures of behavioral despair (Figures
S1A and S1B). We conclude that FGF21 acts directly on
the brain to regulate sweet preference without causing
despair.
To determine whether FGF21 also affects sweet preference in
primates, we analyzed saccharin preference in obese cynomol-
gus monkeys administered PF-05231023, a long-acting FGF21
analog consisting of two molecules of modified FGF21 linked
by an antibody scaffold (Dong et al., 2015; Giragossian et al.,
2015; Weng et al., 2015). We first tested this analog in mice.
PF-05231023 administration decreased saccharin preference
to a degree similar to native FGF21, with maximal efficacy
observed 3–5 days after dosing (Figure 2A). For the monkey
study, PF-05231023 or vehicle was administered on days 1, 4,
and 7 of the 3-week experiment. Notably, PF-05231023 admin-
istration significantly decreased saccharin preference in the
monkeys (Figure 2B). The effect on saccharin intake in the mon-
keys was striking even within 1 day of receiving a single dose of
the FGF21 analog, and the effect was sustained for several days
after receiving the last dose. Thus, FGF21 also affects sweet
preference in primates.
The neurotransmitter dopamine has a central role in regulating
reward behavior, including sucrose and saccharin preference
(Fernstrom et al., 2012). To examine whether FGF21 affects
dopamine signaling, including the mesolimbic pathway, we first
measured b-Klotho expression in the ventral tegmental area
(VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), medial prefrontal cortex
(PFC), and caudate putamen (CP) of Klb+/� and Klb�/� mice,
with the latter mice serving as a negative control. As expected
(Bookout et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2014), Klb mRNA was de-
tected in the suprachiasmatic nucleus/paraventricular (SCN/
PVN) nucleus region of the hypothalamus in Klb+/� mice by
quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Figure 3A). Klb mRNA was also de-
tected in VTA and NAc in Klb+/� mice, albeit at relatively low
levels, but not the PFC or CP (Figure 3A). As expected, Klb
mRNA was not detected in any of the regions in the Klb�/� con-
trol mice (Figure 3A). Consistent with the qPCR data, Klb mRNA
was detected by in situ hybridization in SCN and a small subset
of cells in the VTA and NAc (Figure S2A). Expression of FGF
receptor 1, which partners with b-Klotho to form the FGF21 re-
ceptor, was detected by qPCR in all of these brain regions
(Figure S2B).
The FGF21 receptor expression data led us to examine
whether FGF21 affects the levels of dopamine and its metabo-
lites in NAc, which coordinates reward behaviors. Notably,
FGF21 administration for 2 weeks significantly decreased dopa-
mine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic
acid (HVA), and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) concentrations (Fig-
ure 3B). FGF21 administration did not decrease dopamine,
DOPAC, HVA, or 3-MT concentrations in the CP (Figure S2C).
FGF21 administration also caused changes in the expression
of dopamine-related genes, including an increase in the dopa-
mine transporter in the NAc and CP and a decrease in cate-
chol-O-methyl transferase in the VTA and CP (Figures 3C and
3D). FGF21 had little or no effect on the mRNA levels of tyrosine
hydroxylase or dopamine receptor 1 in these brain regions (Fig-
ures S2D and S2E), nor did it change the levels of total and

 phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase in VTA (Figure S2F). Taken
together, these data suggest that FGF21 may affect sweet pref-
erence via effects on dopamine signaling. However, additional
experiments will be required to confirm this possibility and to
determine the mechanism whereby FGF21 reduces dopamine
concentrations.
Since dopamine signaling impacts ethanol drinking behavior
(Gonzales et al., 2004), we examined whether FGF21 also
affects alcohol preference. Groups of WT and Tg(Fgf21) mice
were exposed stepwise to increasing concentrations of ethanol
in a two-bottle preference assay. Tg(Fgf21) mice had a
decreased ethanol preference ratio at the 4%, 8%, 12%, and
16% ethanol concentrations (Figure 4A, Table S3). In an
ethanol bioavailability test, there was no difference between
WT and Tg(Fgf21) mice in plasma ethanol concentrations at
1 and 3 hr after ethanol administration (Figure 4B). Thus,
FGF21 suppresses ethanol preference without affecting its
bioavailability.
In summary, we show that FGF21 regulates sweet and
alcohol preference in mice and sweet preference in monkeys.
Since circulating levels of FGF21 increase in response to
carbohydrate consumption in rodents and humans (Dushay
et al., 2015; Sa
´ nchez et al., 2009) and alcohol consumption in
rodents (Zhao et al., 2015), this may represent a feedforward
regulatory pathway for limiting consumption. In mice, the ef-
fects on sweet and alcohol preference correlate with reductions
in dopamine concentrations in the NAc, which coordinates
reward behavior. These results suggest a mechanistic basis
for the association between SNPs in and around the FGF21
gene with macronutrient preference in humans (Chu et al.,
2013; Tanaka et al., 2013). Moreover, since FGF21 is currently
in clinical trials for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes, these
findings suggest that additional studies are warranted to
assess the effects of FGF21 on sweet and alcohol preference
and other reward behavior in humans.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mouse Experiments with FGF21
All mouse experiments involving native FGF21 were approved by the
Internal Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas South-
western Medical Center. WT and Tg(Fgf21) mice were on a C57BL/6J back-
ground. Klbfl/fl and KlbCamk2a mice were on a mixed C57BL/6J;129/Sv back-
ground as described (Bookout et al., 2013). All experiments were performed
with 2- to 4-month-old male mice. Tg(Fgf21) and Klbfl/fl mouse experiments
were performed with littermates. Mice were housed on a standard 12 hr
light/dark cycle and had free access to chow. Recombinant human
FGF21
protein
was
provided
by
Novo
Nordisk
and
administered
by subcutaneous osmotic minipumps (Alzet) at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day.
Mice were allowed to recover from minipump surgery for 1 week prior to
preference tests. Mice were single-caged following minipump surgery,
which was conducted under isoflurane anesthesia and 24 hr buprenorphine
analgesia.
Two-Bottle Preference Assays
For the two-bottle sucrose and saccharin preference assays, mice were accli-
mated to cages with two bottles of just water for 4 days. Mice were then given
access to bottles with water and water containing 3% sucrose or 0.2%
saccharin (w/v). For the quinine preference assay, mice were given access
to water and water containing 2 mg/dl quinine. In each case, consumption
was measured daily for at least 3 days. For ethanol preference assays, mice
were given access to two bottles, one containing water and the other contain-
ing either 2%, 4%, 8%, 12%, or 16% ethanol (v/v) in water. The same mice
were exposed to an ascending concentration of each ethanol concentration
for 5 days. The position of the two bottles was changed every 2 days to
exclude position effects. Water and ethanol-containing water intake were
measured each day.
Mouse Immobility Assays
Tail-suspension and forced-swim tests were performed as described (Can
et al., 2012a, 2012b) on mice administered either FGF21 or vehicle by osmotic
minipump for 7–14 days. In both tests, the experimenter was blinded to the
treatment group. For the forced-swim test, mice were placed in cylindrical
tanks (20 cm in diameter) filled with water (25 ± 2�C). The cylinder was filled
to a depth of 12 cm to prevent the mice from using their tails to support

bile was recorded over the course of a 6 min experiment.
Ethanol Clearance Assays
Mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with ethanol (4 g/kg) in saline, and
tail vein blood was drawn at regular intervals. Plasma ethanol levels were
measured using the EnzyChrom Ethanol Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems).
Microdissection of Brain Regions
Mouse brains were extracted from the skull and kept under dry ice vapor for all
dissections. Coronal sections (1-mm thick) were cut using a brain-slicing ma-
trix (Braintree Scientific). Medial prefrontal cortex, whole NAc (shell and core),
the hypothalamic SCN/PVN region, CP (striatum), and VTA were identified by
gross architectural landmarks (Paxinos and Franklin, 2004). Medial prefrontal
cortex and the hypothalamic SCN/PVN region were dissected using a 14G tis-
sue punch. NAc, CPA, and the VTA were dissected using a 16G tissue punch.

In Situ Hybridization Analysis
Brains were dissected from male C57BL/6J mice,
embedded in OCT compound (Sakura), and flash
frozen in cooled isopentane. Coronal sections (14–
16 mm) were cut using a cryostat (Leica) followed by
fixation for 15 min at 4�C with 10% neutral buffered
formalin. In situ hybridization was performed using
the RNAscope 2.5 brown chromogenic assay pre-
treatment and detection kits (Advanced Cell Diagnos-
tics). Probes for cyclophilin B (positive control), dapB
(negative control), and Klb were purchased from
Advanced Cell Diagnostics.
Hybridized sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated,
cleared, and mounted with Ecomount (Biocare Med-
ical). Images were taken using a Zeiss Axioscan Z1 at
403 magnification. The signal from the mRNA was highlighted using the color
threshold function in ImageJ.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies for total (Cell Signaling,
#2792) and Ser40-phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase (AbCam, #51206).
Data were acquired and quantified using an ImageQuant LAS 4000 and Multi
Gauge v3.1 software (Fujifilm).
Dopamine Measurements
Dopamine and its metabolites were measured by HPLC by the Vanderbilt
Neurochemistry Core.
Mouse and Monkey Experiments with PF-05231023
All animal care and experimental procedures for studies involving PF-
05231023 were conducted in compliance with the U.S. Animal Welfare Act

 and the ILAR Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 1996. The pro-
cedures used in these studies were reviewed and approved by the Pfizer Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP #GTN-2013-00793).
Male C57BL/6J mice fed a 60% high-fat diet (Research Diets D12492i) for
12–14 weeks were used for the saccharin studies. Mice were single-housed
with access to regular water and 0.1% saccharin (S6047, Sigma-Aldrich) water
throughout the study. Water intake was monitored using a BioDaq system
(Research Diets Inc.). The position of sweetened and unsweetened water bot-
tles was switched each day to eliminate positional preference. Mice were
acclimatized to the cage for 10–14 days, after which they were stratified based
on body weight and baseline saccharin water intake. PF-05231023 (Huang
et al., 2013; Weng et al., 2015) or vehicle was administered subcutaneously
twice per week for a total of three doses at 10 mg/kg.
Male Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus monkeys) from Charles River Labo-
ratories were single-housed under a 12 hr light/dark cycle. Monkeys were be-
tween 7 and 24 years of age and weighed between 7 and 12 kg. Monkeys were
provided standard lab diet 5K91 (LabDiet) supplemented once a day with fruits
and peanuts. The two-bottle saccharin preference assay was performed as
described (Tordoff and Bachmanov, 2003). The monkeys underwent a training
period during which the standard water system was shut off and two bottles,
one with water and the other with water containing 0.2% saccharin, were
attached side-by-side to the cage. To determine the amount of water
consumed, bottles were weighed before and after filling, with the difference
in weight equated to the volume consumed. The position of sweetened and
unsweetened water bottles was switched each day to eliminate positional
preference. Several animals in the original cohort were eliminated from the
study due to water bottle damage, failure to adapt to the water bottle, or if
one of the allocation endpoints represented an outlier.
Fifteen monkeys were divided into two groups based on body weight, tri-
glyceride and fasted glucose levels, and baseline daily food and water con-
sumption. Following a baseline period, PF-05231023 or vehicle (30 mM lactate
[pH 4.8], 9% Trehalose, 0.05 mg/ml EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml L-methionine, 0.5 mg/ml
Tween 20) was administered intravenously to eight and seven animals, respec-
tively, on days 1, 4, and 7. Dosing was performed in a blinded manner. Water
consumption was monitored at least twice daily.
Statistical Analyses
All data are expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical analysis between the two
groups was performed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test using Excel or
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) or by using R software (Fraley
et al., 2012; Pinheiro et al., 2013).
