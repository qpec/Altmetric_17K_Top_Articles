Temperate phages drive genomic diversification in bacterial patho-
gens. Phage-derived sequences are more common in pathogenic than
nonpathogenic taxa and are associated with changes in pathogen
virulence. High abundance and mobilization of temperate phages
within hosts suggests that temperate phages could promote within-
host evolution of bacterial pathogens. However, their role in pathogen
evolution has not been experimentally tested. We experimentally
evolved replicate populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with or
without a community of three temperate phages active in cystic
fibrosis (CF) lung infections, including the transposable phage, ɸ4,
which is closely related to phage D3112. Populations grew as free-
floating biofilms in artificial sputum medium, mimicking sputum of CF
lungs where P. aeruginosa is an important pathogen and undergoes
evolutionary adaptation and diversification during chronic infection.
Although bacterial populations adapted to the biofilm environment
in both treatments, population genomic analysis revealed that
phages altered both the trajectory and mode of evolution. Popu-
lations evolving with phages exhibited a greater degree of parallel
evolution and faster selective sweeps than populations without
phages. Phage ɸ4 integrated randomly into the bacterial chromo-
some, but integrations into motility-associated genes and regulators
of quorum sensing systems essential for virulence were selected in
parallel, strongly suggesting that these insertional inactivation mu-
tations were adaptive. Temperate phages, and in particular transpos-
able phages, are therefore likely to facilitate adaptive evolution of
bacterial pathogens within hosts.

omparative genomics suggests that temperate phages play an
important role in the evolution and genomic diversification
of bacterial pathogens (1). Bacterial genomes often contain a range
of intact and remnant prophage elements (1–3), and ecologically
important bacterial traits are believed to be phage-derived (e.g.,
phage-derived bacteriocins) (4). Phage-related sequences are ob-
served more frequently in pathogenic than nonpathogenic strains
(5), and prophage acquisition can be associated with changes in
pathogen virulence (6, 7). Prophages can directly contribute acces-
sory gene functions (1, 8) or disrupt bacterial genes by insertional
inactivation. Of particular note are the transposable class of tem-
perate phages (also known as mutator phages), including D3112 of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9, 10), which integrate throughout the
chromosome disrupting existing genes and increasing the supply of
mutations available to selection. Recent reports of high rates of
phage mobilization within hosts (11) and high temperate phage
abundance in humans (12), including at sites of chronic infection
where phage particles have been observed to exceed bacterial host
densities by 10- to 100-fold (13), suggests that temperate phages
could play an important role in driving within-host evolution of
bacterial pathogens. However, experimental tests of the hypothesis
that temperate phages contribute to rapid evolutionary adaptation of
pathogenic bacteria are lacking.
P. aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen and the
major cause of chronic lung infection leading to morbidity
and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (14). Populations of
P. aeruginosa in the CF lung grow as microcolony biofilms suspended
within lung sputum and undergo extensive genetic diversification
(15–17) and rapid evolutionary adaptation (18, 19) to this host en-
vironment. Characteristic bacterial adaptations to life in the CF lung
and the transition to chronicity include the evolution of mucoidy,
altered metabolism, loss of motility, quorum sensing defects, and
resistance to antibiotics (18, 20). Despite detailed knowledge of the
targets of selection, we still have only a very limited understanding of
the causes of selection driving the evolution of these phenotypes.
Phages are known to be present in the CF lung, have been cultured
from lung sputa (21, 22), and have been detected at high abundance
using culture-independent molecular approaches (13). Moreover,
prophages are a common feature of P. aeruginosa sequenced
genomes (23), and lysogenic conversion has been linked to the
evolution of key clinical phenotypes (e.g., mucoidy) (24, 25).
Therefore, it is likely that temperate phages may both impose
selection on P. aeruginosa in the CF lung and contribute to
pathogen adaptation to this host environment.
Significance
During chronic infection, bacterial pathogens undergo rapid evo-
lutionary adaptation and extensive genetic diversification affecting
patient symptoms and treatment outcomes. Temperate phages are
common in pathogen genomes, and phage particles can reach high
abundance in human infections, but their role in pathogen evo-
lution is unclear. Using experimental evolution and population
genomics, we show that temperate phages found in human in-
fections accelerated pathogen evolution by increasing the supply
of beneficial mutations and imposing strong selection on bacte-
rial populations. Notably, phages accelerated the loss of clinically
important virulence-related bacterial traits, including motility and
quorum sensing. Temperate phages are likely therefore to facil-
itate rapid evolution of bacterial pathogens and contribute to
their adaptation to the host environment and clinical treatments.

 We used experimental evolution to directly test how temper-
ate phages affect P. aeruginosa adaptation in artificial sputum
medium (ASM), an in vitro environment that recapitulates key
physiochemical and biofilm growth properties of CF lung sputum
(26). Specifically, we propagated six replicate populations of
P. aeruginosa PAO1 in the presence vs. absence of an assemblage
of three temperate phages (LESɸ2, ɸ3, and ɸ4) for ∼240 bac-
terial generations. These temperate phages naturally coexist as
prophages in the genome of the P. aeruginosa Liverpool epi-
demic strain (LESB58) (27), the dominant clone infecting the
UK CF population (28), and contribute to its competitiveness
in vivo (27, 29–31). Whereas ɸ2 and ɸ3 are insertion site specific,
ɸ4 is closely related to D3112, which is known to insert randomly
throughout the P. aeruginosa chromosome (9, 10) and may
therefore play an important role in facilitating the evolutionary
adaptation of P. aeruginosa by increasing mutational supply. All
phages display high rates of lytic activity in chronic CF lung in-
fections (13), including being induced into the lytic cycle by
clinically relevant antibiotics (21).
Results and Discussion
In the experimental populations, phages had no effect on bacterial
densities (Fig. S1A) despite evidence of ongoing phage lysis in all
replicate populations of the phage treatment (Fig. S1B). At the end
of the experiment, free virions of all phages were detected in four
of six populations, whereas in the other two populations, only ɸ3
and ɸ4 virions were detected (Fig. S1C). We observed high rates of
lysogeny [i.e., integration of prophage(s) into the bacterial chro-
mosome] in five of six populations, but the phages differed in their
propensity to form lysogens: lysogens of the transposable phage ɸ4
approached fixation in five of six populations, whereas lysogeni-
zation of bacteria by the other phages was less common, and,
where observed, was typically as a polylysogen in combination with
ɸ4 (Fig. S2). Thus, lysogeny, and indeed polylysogeny, was rapidly
established in our experimental populations; moreover, lysogeny
appears to have been essential for the long-term maintenance of
phages in populations.
To determine the fitness response to selection, we competed
each evolved population against the ancestral PAO1 in ASM,
and because lysogens may have higher fitness simply due to phage-
mediated killing of susceptible competitors (29, 31, 32), we also
performed competitions against a phage-resistant PAO1ΔpilA, an
isogenic knockout mutant strain lacking the gene encoding the type
IV pilus protein PilA [all of the temperate phages used here infect
via the type IV pilus (33)]. We observed that evolved populations
from both treatments were fitter relative both to PAO1 and
PAO1ΔpilA [Fig. 1; one-sample t test (alt = 0), all significant at an
α level of 0.0125]. Populations evolved with phages had higher
fitness than populations evolved without phages relative to PAO1,
but this fitness advantage of evolving with phages was lost when
competing against PAO1ΔpilA (Fig. 1; treatment × competitor
interaction: F1,20 = 8.54, P < 0.01; simple effect of treatment
against competitor PAO1: F1,10 = 7.12, P < 0.025; and simple effect
of treatment against competitor PAO1ΔpilA: F1,10 = 1.53, P =
0.24). Together these data confirm that populations in both
treatments adapted to the sputum-like environment and that
lysogenised hosts had enhanced competitiveness against phage-
susceptible competitors.
To determine the genetic basis of the observed evolutionary
adaptation, we performed whole genome sequencing on population
samples containing 40 random clones pooled per population from
the end of the experiment. All populations contained SNPs and
small insertions or deletions (indels), and all replicate populations
that had evolved with phages contained integrated prophages. At the
genome-wide scale, populations evolved with or without phages did
not differ in abundance or frequency of SNPs and indels (excluding
insertions caused by prophage integrations) and both groups had
high variance of polymorphic sites: between 16 and 173 among the
phage-free populations and 17–176 among the phage-containing
populations (Table S1).
Parallel evolution at a particular locus, where independent
mutations are observed more often than expected by chance, is
strong evidence for positive selection. For example, in the absence
of selection, the probability of observing a mutation in two pop-
ulations at the conclusion of the experiment is only P = 0.003, and
P = 0.0002 if observed in three populations (for an average 1,004-bp
protein-coding sequence in the PAO1 genome). Thus, to identify
loci likely to have been under selection during experimental evo-
lution, we concentrated our analyses on the subset of genes that
had been targeted by mutations in at least two replicate pop-
ulations per treatment (Fig. 2 and Tables S2 and S3). A greater
degree of parallel evolution was observed in the presence of phages
(measured as the probability of randomly drawing a pair of mu-
tated genes from different populations, with phages 0.056 ± 0.016
SE and without phages 0.024 ± 0.007 SE, P < 0.05 by bootstrap
test). Some parallel targets of selection were shared among treat-
ments, including genes involved in the type IV pilus motility, fla-
gellar motility, biofilm formation, metabolism, and regulation,
suggesting that these mutations were beneficial in the sputum-like
environment per se. Interestingly, some loci were more likely to
evolve in the presence of phages. In particular, mutations affecting
the quorum sensing (QS) transcriptional regulators lasR and mvfR
were each observed in five of six replicate phage-treated pop-
ulations compared with only one of six replicate phage-free pop-
ulations. In addition, three of six populations evolving with phages
vs. one of six evolving without phages contained mutations in fha1,
which encodes the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain protein that
posttranslationally activates type VI secretion (34). A further in-
dication of stronger selection due to phages is that parallel se-
lected loci displayed higher allele frequencies in the phage
treatment (mean allele frequency = 34.33 ± 3.2 SEM/40) com-
pared with the control treatment (mean allele frequency = 22.67 ±
3 SEM/40), suggesting that selective sweeps in the phage

 treatment were closer to fixation (discussed in more detail in SI
Materials and Methods and SI Results and Discussion).
A key difference between the populations evolving with, vs.
without, phages is that a substantial fraction of ORFs under positive
selection (8 of 26; Fig. 2) contained mutations caused by prophage
integration in the phage-containing treatment. Prophage 2 and 3
were found exclusively at the intergenic sites homologous to their
positions in the LESB58 chromosome from where they were isolated
(4,629,220 and 4,103,724 bp in the PAO1 chromosome) and were
therefore excluded from analyses. In contrast, ɸ4 integrations were
observed at 19 different positions across the six replicates, suggesting
that ɸ4 integration provided an additional source of genetic diversity
for selection to act on. Although ɸ4 is closely related to D3112 and
therefore likely to integrate randomly throughout the chromosome
(10, 27, 33), we tested for hotspots of integration with an exhaustive
search of sequence motifs using the Multiple Em for Motif Elicita-
tion (MEME) and Motif Alignment and Search Tool (MAST) al-
gorithms (35, 36) in the 1,000-bp region around each of the
integration sites. Only very weakly conserved motifs were identified
(Table S4), suggesting that ɸ4 has the low integration specificity
characteristic of transposable phages like D3112. Despite the very
low integration specificity of ɸ4, all of the 19 integration sites were
located within or adjacent to only seven different operons, which is
consistent with positive selection for integrations at those regions
(Fig. 2 and Tables S5 and S6). The functions most commonly pre-
dicted to be disrupted by positively selected ɸ4 integration events
were type IV pilus motility and QS. Thus, transposable temperate
phages like ɸ4 may commonly alter the mode of bacterial evolution
by increasing the supply of mutations available to natural selection.
Because all of the temperate phages used here infect via the
type IV pilus (33) and PAO1ΔpilA mutants showed higher fitness
compared with PAO1 against lysogenized bacteria evolved in the
phage treatment (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that disruption of type
IV pilus motility associated genes may have been selected to pre-
vent superinfection and lysis of ɸ4 lysogens. Notably, although ɸ4
lysogens have strong superinfection immunity against ɸ4, they re-
main susceptible to infection and subsequent lysis by ɸ2 and ɸ3
(33), suggesting that loss of type IV pili could be beneficial in the
presence of a diverse phage community. In support of this, we
observed higher rates of phage resistance in populations that
evolved with vs. without phages (Fig. 3A; Mann–Whitney test;
W = 24.0, n1 = n2 = 6, P = 0.02). Correspondingly, type IV pilus-
dependent twitching motility was lost more rapidly in phage-
containing populations than in phage-free populations, suggesting
that the loss of type IV pilus function was more strongly selected
in the presence of phages (Fig. 3B). To determine whether loss of
type IV pilus twitching motility phenotype was associated with ɸ4
integration, we tracked allele frequency dynamics in two replicate
populations. Specific PCR primer sets (Table S7) were used to
detect integrated ɸ4 prophage in type IV fimbral biogenesis pro-
tein encoding genes fimU and pilV. In both cases, there was a
positive association between the allele frequency dynamics and the
rise in frequency of twitching motility-deficient mutants (Fig. 3C).
We next contrasted the allele frequencies of SNPs, indels, and ɸ4
prophage-integration mutations occurring at type IV pilus
Fig. 2.

circle corresponds to a replicate population in either the control (without phages) or treatment group (with phages), as indicated. Positions around each
concentric circle, starting at the 12 o’clock position and in a clockwise direction, correspond to positions around the published P. aeruginosa PAO1 single
circular chromosome. The smaller circles around each concentric circle indicate the positions of variants in each replicate that were observed in an ORF under
positive selection, i.e., mutated in parallel in at least one other replicate. Only variants in fha1 were at precisely the same position and were likely to be
homologous. Variants are also listed in Table S6.

 associated loci. Across six phage-treated populations, 12 mutations
of the type IV pilus-associated genes were detected in parallel, the
majority (n = 9) were caused by ɸ4 prophage integration, and half
of them (n = 6/12) occurred at high frequencies (≥10/40 clones per
population). However, in the absence of phages, although more
mutations were detected in these genes in parallel (n = 16), only
13% of these mutations occurred at high frequency (Table S3).
Consistent with the phenotypic data (Fig. 3 B and C), this suggests
that there was stronger positive selection for mutations disrupting
type IV pilus-associated genes in the presence of phages, driving
faster selective sweeps, compared with type IV pilus disrupting
mutations occurring in the absence of phages. The exception to this
pattern is replicate 3 of the phage treatment, where the im-
pairment of twitching motility in 35 out of 40 isolates can be
explained by a single frame-shift deletion variant in pilY1
(PA4554; encodes a type IV pili biogenesis protein; Fig. 2). It is
notable that a low frequency of lysogeny was observed in this
population, unlike all other phage treatment replicates where
lysogens approached fixation (Fig. S2).
Our genomic data suggest that temperate phages promoted the
loss of QS with positive selection of ɸ4 prophage integrations, SNPs,
and indel mutations at the mvfR and lasR loci. Mutations to lasR
lead to disruption of the acyl-homoserine-lactone (AHL) signaling
system (37), whereas mutations to mvfR lead to disruption of the
Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) system (38), suggesting large-
scale alterations to QS cell–cell signaling in populations evolving
with phages. To test whether QS deficient bacteria have higher
fitness in the presence of phages, we competed PAO1 against
PAO1ΔlasR in ASM with and without the temperate phages. There
was no effect of phages on the fitness of PAO1ΔlasR (Fig. S3; two-
sample t test, t10 = −0.7989, P = 0.44), which was substantially fitter
relative to PAO1 in both the presence [one-sample t test (alt = 0),
t5 = 5.0331, P < 0.01] and absence [one-sample t test (alt = 0), t5 =
6.7065, P = 0.001] of phages. These data suggest that lasR mutations
are beneficial in ASM per se. This interpretation is consistent with
the observation that single populations in the phage-free treatment
also acquired mutations in QS genes, but suggests that the rate of
evolution at these loci was higher in the presence of phages. Second,
we compared the rates of spontaneous phage lysis of ɸ4 lysogens
constructed in both the PAO1 and PAO1ΔlasR backgrounds: there
was no significant difference in production of free phages in sta-
tionary phase cultures (median free phage density: PAO1, 3.4 × 108
pfu/mL, PAO1ΔlasR, 3.3 × 108 pfu/mL; Mann–Whitney test; W =
92.0, P = 0.345). Thus, although direct interaction between tem-
perate phages and bacterial QS has been reported in other systems,
via QS induced lysis by phages (39) or QS mediated alteration of
phage receptor expression by bacteria (40), this does not appear to
be an important factor in our study. Phages may have simply in-
creased the supply of large effect mutations available to natural
selection, notably via ɸ4 prophage integrations into mvfR (Fig. 2).
Alternatively, there may have been epistatic interactions between
the fitness effects of QS mutations and other positively selected
mutations, which strengthened selection for loss of QS in the
presence of phages. Mutations in QS regulators are commonly
observed to accumulate over time in CF chronic infection (41).
Both AHL and PQS signaling are required for full virulence in
P. aeruginosa (42), suggesting that temperate phage selection
may accelerate the loss of virulence in chronic infections.
In summary, we showed that temperate phages enhanced par-
allel evolution in P. aeruginosa biofilms in a sputum-like environ-
ment. Our data suggest two ways in which this may have occurred:
first, the transposable phage ɸ4 mediated adaptive evolution by

 increasing the supply of positively selected mutations via insertional
inactivation of genes caused by prophage integrations, particularly
in type IV pilus and QS associated genes. Second, we present ev-
idence that temperate phage strengthened selection, particularly
for mutations in type IV pilus associated genes, accelerating the
evolutionary loss of type IV dependent pilus motility presumably to
avoid superinfection and subsequent lysis by phages which infect
via the type IV pilus. A recent transposon sequencing study of
P. aeruginosa PA14 shows that mutations in type IV pilus associ-
ated genes increase fitness in the murine lung (43). Moreover, loss
of both motility (44, 45) and QS (46, 47) functions are known to
frequently evolve in P. aeruginosa chronic infections of the CF lung.
Temperate phages, including those used here, can be present at
very high densities in the CF lung [exceeding bacterial densities by
orders of magnitude (13)], which taken together with our findings
suggests that temperate phages could play an important role in CF
lung infections by driving the evolution of these clinically important
traits in P. aeruginosa. In addition, our data suggest that living in a
sputum-like environment per se selects for mutations in genes as-
sociated with motility, biofilm formation, metabolism and regula-
tion. Similar mutations observed in CF lung isolated P. aeruginosa
are therefore likely to be at least partially explained simply as ad-
aptations to selection imposed by the sputum environment, but
could have implications for susceptibility to antibiotics (48) or host
immune responses (49) as correlated responses (50). Experimental
evolution in clinically relevant infection models has the potential to
enhance our understanding of the causal links between sources of
selection and the evolutionary responses of pathogens in infections
(51), advancing our understanding of within host pathogen evolu-
tion and our ability to direct this for improved patient health.
Materials and Methods
Twelve replicate microcosms (30-mL glass universals containing 5 mL ASM)
were inoculated with 5 × 107 cells P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 and grown as a
biofilm [37 °C incubation with shaking at 60 rpm (Stuart SI500 16-mm orbital
shaking incubator, Bibby Scientific Ltd.)]. LES phages φ2, 3, and 4 were
added to six microcosms after 24 h of growth to a total multiplicity of in-
fection of 0.1 (phage treatment), and the remaining six were designated
phage-free controls. Phages were added only once, at the beginning of the
experiment. After a further 72-h growth, biofilms were homogenized with
an equal volume of Sputasol and the homogenate transferred (1:100) into
fresh ASM. Transfers were repeated every 4 d, to a total of 30 transfers
(∼240 bacterial generations). Every other transfer, bacterial and total free
phage densities were enumerated, and every five transfers, the frequency of
prophage carriage in the phage treatment was estimated with a multiplex
PCR assay using primers targeted to each of the LES phages. At transfers 5,
15, and 30, 40 isolates per population were screened for the type IV pilus-
mediated twitching motility phenotype using the agar stab method.
At the end of the experiment, DNA was extracted from 40 isolates per
population and pooled, and the pooled DNA sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq
2000. Polymorphisms were called from reads aligned to the published PAO1
genome treating each sample as having ploidy = 40, reflecting the number of
pooled isolates. ɸ4 prophage insertion sites were estimated from the map-
ping locations of reads that mapped to the PAO1 chromosome and whose
mate read mapped to the ɸ4 prophage sequence. The MEME software suite
(35, 36) was used for motif analysis. First, the 20 most conserved motifs at ɸ4
prophage integration sites were selected using the MEME algorithm. Sec-
ond, the entire host chromosome was searched for motif occurrences using
the MAST algorithm (see SI Materials and Methods for details). Frequencies
of each prophage integration site were estimated based on the number of
read pairs split between prophage and reference chromosomes as a pro-
portion of read pair depth in that region. ORF annotations from the pub-
lished sequence were supplemented using the STRING v10 database (52).
Counts of ORFs affected by mutations in more than one population per
treatment were implemented using the BioPython library ver. 1.65 (53), and
chromosome map plots were implemented using the svgwrite library ver.
1.1.3 in Python ver. 2.7.10. Included in the parallel selected loci were those
exhibiting the “multidiverse” signature of unlinked polymorphisms in the
same ORFs. The method is implemented in the CheckLinkage option of
BAGA (https://github.com/daveuu/baga) (54) and discussed in SI Materials
and Methods.
Relative free phage abundances in end point populations were estimated
separately for each phage using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay of DNase-
treated supernatants, using primers targeted to each phage and comparison
with a set of standards of known concentration. Competitions were per-
formed between end point populations against the ancestral PAO1 (labeled
with a gentamicin resistance marker) or an isogenic LES phage-resistant
competitor, PAO1ΔpilA (labeled with a tetracycline resistance marker), in
conditions identical to one transfer of the selection experiment. The density
of each competitor was determined by plating onto antibiotic selective and
nonselective media. Fitness was calculated as the selection rate constant.
Free phage densities were measured for LESφ4 lysogens in both PAO1 and
PAO1ΔlasR. Ten independent lysogens were constructed in each host
background (PAO1 and PAO1ΔlasR) and cultured in LB until the stationary
phase, and free phage densities in the supernatant were quantified using a
plaque assay. Full methods are included in SI Materials and Methods.
