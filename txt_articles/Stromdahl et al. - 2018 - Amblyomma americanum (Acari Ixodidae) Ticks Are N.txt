Abstract
In the early 1980s, Ixodes spp. ticks were implicated as the key North American vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi (Johnson, 
Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt and Brenner) (Spirocheatales:  Spirochaetaceae), the etiological agent of Lyme disease. 
Concurrently, other human-biting tick species were investigated as potential B. burgdorferi vectors. Rashes thought to 
be erythema migrans were observed in patients bitten by Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari:  Ixodidae) ticks, and 
spirochetes were visualized in a small percentage of A. americanum using fluorescent antibody staining methods, 
sparking interest in this species as a candidate vector of B. burgdorferi. Using molecular methods, the spirochetes were 
subsequently described as Borrelia lonestari sp. nov. (Spirocheatales: Spirochaetaceae), a transovarially transmitted 
relapsing fever Borrelia of uncertain clinical significance. In total, 54 surveys from more than 35 research groups, involving 
more than 52,000 ticks, have revealed a low prevalence of B. lonestari, and scarce B. burgdorferi, in A. americanum. 
In Lyme disease-endemic areas, A. americanum commonly feeds on B. burgdorferi-infected hosts; the extremely low 
prevalence of B. burgdorferi in this tick results from a saliva barrier to acquiring infection from infected hosts. At least nine 
transmission experiments involving B. burgdorferi in A. americanum have failed to demonstrate vector competency. 
Advancements in molecular analysis strongly suggest that initial reports of B. burgdorferi in A. americanum across 
many states were misidentified B. lonestari, or DNA contamination, yet the early reports continue to be cited without 
regard to the later clarifying studies. In this article, the surveillance and vector competency studies of B. burgdorferi in 
A. americanum are reviewed, and we conclude that A. americanum is not a vector of B. burgdorferi.
Key words:  Amblyomma americanum, Borrelia burgdorferi, prevalence, vector competency
Sylvatic transmission cycles of the spirochetal bacterium Borrelia 
burgdorferi (Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt and Brenner) (Spiro
cheatales: Spirochaetaceae), the etiological agent of Lyme disease, are 
widespread in the eastern United States. Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: 
Ixodidae) ticks are recognized as the key vector in the eastern half of 
the United States; however, other human-biting ticks – particularly 
Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) feed on many of the 
same wildlife reservoirs, leading to concerns that this tick species also 
may contribute to the risk of acquiring Lyme disease. Here we review 
the literature describing 30 yr of surveillance of A. americanum for 
Borrelia spp. and summarize the results of multiple vector competency 
studies undertaken on this tick. This body of research overwhelmingly 
indicates that A. americanum is not a vector of B. burgdorferi.
Discovery of B. burgdorferi and Investigation 
of Possible Vector Ticks
Lyme disease was first recognized and described in the United States 
in 1975 (Steere et al. 1977). Willy Burgdorfer and colleagues dis-
covered the spirochetal agent, later described as B. burgdorferi, in 
Journal of Medical Entomology, 55(3), 2018, 501–514

 I. scapularis (dammini) ticks from Shelter Island, NY, and demon-
strated the vector competency of this tick species (Burgdorfer et al. 
1982). The agent was later found to also be transmitted by human-
biting Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae) in the 
western United States and by other human-biting Ixodes genus ticks 
in Eurasia (Lane et al. 1991, Rudenko et al. 2011). Additionally, sev-
eral Ixodes spp. that do not regularly feed on humans have been 
implicated as responsible in maintaining sylvatic transmission of 
B. burgdorferi (Clark et al. 2002). During the early years of Lyme 
disease research, other common species of anthropophilic ticks were 
also investigated as potential vectors of the agent of the disease. 
Some of the publications from the 1980s and 1990s (reviewed below 
and summarized in Table 1) described spirochetes in A. americanum 
and identified them as B. burgdorferi. However, these early investi-
gations used microscopy and fluorescent antibody staining methods 
that depend on subjective interpretation and can detect related spiro-
chete species (Barbour et al. 1996), or remnants of dead spirochetes 
(Bockenstedt et al. 2012). Many of the studies involved ticks removed 
while feeding on animal hosts, and spirochetes detected were likely 
in the bloodmeal in the ticks’ midgut rather than representing infec-
tions within the ticks’ bodies. Also, contamination is suspected in 
some investigations of A. americanum, as results were not repeat-
able and suspect-positives shared identity with the Borrelia strain 
used for positive control (Nelson 1995, Piesman and Happ 1997). 
Subsequent studies (vide infra) provided further evidence that the 
presence of other spirochetes, degraded spirochetes, or contamin-
ation most likely account for the reports of B. burgdorferi in these 
early studies.
Concurrently with these tick surveillance studies, experiments 
to evaluate the ability of A. americanum to acquire and transmit 
B. burgdorferi were conducted, and added no evidence to support the 
role of A. americanum in Lyme disease. Seven studies in the 1980s 
and 1990s failed to demonstrate vector competency of A. america-
num (Piesman and Sinsky 1988, Mather and Mather 1990, Mukolwe 
et al. 1992, Ryder et al. 1992, Oliver et al. 1993, Sanders and Oliver 
1995, Piesman and Happ 1997). Three subsequent studies suggested 
and demonstrated a salivary mechanism for the apparent inability of 
A. americanum to acquire or support colonization by B. burgdorferi 
(Ledin et al. 2005, Soares et al. 2006, Zeidner et al. 2009).
In 1996, phylogenetic analysis of Borrelia DNA sequences 
amplified from A. americanum led to the identification of 
Borrelia lonestari sp. nov. (Spirocheatales: Spirochaetaceae), a 
relapsing fever species distinct from B. burgdorferi (Armstrong 
et al. 1996, Barbour et al. 1996) and other Lyme disease group 
spirochetes. This new spirochete became a focus of research 
after it was detected in both an A. americanum removed from 
a patient suffering a skin rash and in the medium containing a 
biopsy of the rash (James et al. 2001), leading to speculation that 
it was the etiological agent of Southern Tick Associated Rash 
Illness (STARI), which occurs following bites of A. americanum 
(Masters et al. 2008). Many of the subsequent investigations of 
B. lonestari in A. americanum involved screening of ticks using 
genus-wide or broadly reactive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
primers capable of also detecting B. burgdorferi. Consequently, 
publications reporting these investigations provide separate data 
on the prevalences of both B. lonestari and B. burgdorferi infec-
tion in A. americanum, as long as sufficient measures – such as 
nucleotide sequencing, or confirmation with multiple PCR targets 
– were taken to discriminate among Borrelia species in Borrelia-
positive samples (Table 2).

 Since the mid-1980s, at least 35 different research groups have 
published 54 studies describing the investigation of more than 
52,000 A. americanum for B. burgdorferi. Scarce (0.5%) A. ameri-
canum were reported as suspect-positive, and B. burgdorferi was 
never isolated in culture from these ticks. Ten studies evaluating the 
vector competency and the mechanisms of B. burgdorferi evasion 
by A. americanum concluded that this tick species has no relevance 
to the transmission of B. burgdorferi. These studies are discussed in 
detail below.
Initial Investigations of B. burgdorferi in 
A. americanum
Detection by investigators in the 1980s and 1990s of a low preva-
lence (~1%) of Borrelia in more than 18,000 A. americanum 
(Table 1) demonstrated that the ticks were being exposed to spiro-
chetes in host bloodmeals and presaged the discovery of B. lonestari, 
a spirochete that can be maintained in A. americanum. The methods of 
analysis of ticks for Borrelia spp. were typically darkfield microscopy 
and direct fluorescent antibody testing (DFA) or indirect fluorescent 
antibody testing (IFA) using polyclonal antibody (PAb) or monoclonal 
antibody (MAb). In one study, PCR was also used as a final step on 
samples positive by IFA. Analysis by darkfield or IFA with PAb will 
detect related Borrelia species (Barbour et al. 1996), so the identity of 
the species in these studies was not established (Schulze et al. 1984, 
1986; Magnarelli et al. 1986; Levine et al. 1989; Rawlings and Teltow 
1994; Luckhart et al. 1991, 1992; Kollars et al. 2000). Analysis using 
IFA and MAb is designed to be specific for B. burgdorferi (Barbour 
et al. 1983b), and IFA with MAb H5332 has been shown not to react 
with B. lonestari (Varela et al. 2004a); however, incorrect technique can 
produce false positives. False-positive results using a monoclonal anti-
body to the ospA protein (H5332) may arise due to insufficient block-
ing or washing, or concentrations of primary or secondary antibodies 
that are too high, all of which can result in nonspecific binding. Ideally, 
as a negative control studies should use an irrelevant mouse monoclonal 
antibody of the same immunoglobulin type as the monoclonal antibody 
against B. burgdorferi. Buffer or medium by itself may be inadequate as 
a negative control. Most of the studies reviewed here do not present IFA 
methods in enough detail to evaluate whether sufficient measures were 
taken to avoid false positives and none involved use of a negative con-
trol slide with B. lonestari antigen because the organism had not been 
characterized or cultured at the time the studies were conducted (Varela 
et al. 2004a). Furthermore, IFAs with MAbs rely on subjective interpre-
tation and can potentially detect dead cells from host bloodmeals (Allan 
et al. 2010; Bockenstedt et al. 2012); it has been suggested by research-
ers investigating B. burgdorferi xenodiagnosis that ticks might acquire 
dead organisms during feeding (Marques et al. 2014). In the studies 
using the B. burgdorferi-specific MAb H5332, spirochetes were more 
often detected in A. americanum collected from animal hosts (Levine 
et al. 1991, Ouellette et al. 1997), but in some of the studies, spiro-
chetes were detected by MAb H5332 in ticks collected from vegetation 
(Simpson & Hinck 1993, Ouellette et al. 1997, Feir et al. 1994). Results 
of MAb IFA in the study from Feir et al. (1994) were not consistently 
confirmed by subsequent PCR of the samples, and contamination was 
suspected (Nelson 1995). In one IFA study using MAb H5332, the ori-
gin of collection of the single positive tick was not reported, and this 
study included ticks from both vegetation and animal hosts (Sonenshine 
et al. 1995). Five studies reported attempts to culture B. burgdorferi 
from A. americanum ticks; none were successful (Schulze et al. 1986, 
Teltow et al. 1991, Rawlings and Teltow 1994; Rich et al. 2001; Clark 
et al. 2002).

 Investigations of A. americanum from New Jersey
The first investigations of possible B. burgdorferi transmission by 
A. americanum were conducted in the 1980s in New Jersey by 
entomologists from the New Jersey State Department of Health 
(Schulze et al. 1984, Schulze et al. 1986). In the first study, A. ameri-
canum females were removed from two different patient’s erythema 
migrans-like lesions, prompting a field survey in which spirochetes 
were detected in 9.1% (4/44) of A. americanum collected on the 
property where the second patient lived (Schulze et al. 1984). 
However, the authors observed no motile spirochetes in the infected 
A. americanum and remarked that ‘It is not known if nonmotile spi-
rochetes were the result of examining dead or moribund ticks, loss 
of pathogen viability during transtadial passage, or from indigenous 
substances within the tick hostile to spirochete vigor or survival’. The 
second study by the same lead author reported detection of B. burg-
dorferi in 4.6% (35/756) of adult and nymphal A. americanum and 
15.6% (5/32 pools of 15 larvae) of larvae, when identifying spiro-
chetes by darkfield microscopy and DFA testing using fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled rabbit anti-B. burgdorferi antiserum. 
These methods are liable to detect antibodies to infections with 
other Borrelia spp. (Barbour et al. 1996), or antigens of non-viable, 
degraded B. burgdorferi spirochetes (Bockenstedt et al. 2012). The 
researchers were not able to establish cultures in Barbour-Stoenner-
Kelly (BSK) medium – the standard medium used for cultivating 
B. burgdorferi (Barbour et al. 1983a). Subsequently, spirochetes 
found in A. americanum collected by the New Jersey group were 
used to develop the PCR methods instrumental in the first investiga-
tion and description of B. lonestari (Barbour et al. 1996).
In later studies by the same New Jersey research group 
(Schulze et al. 2005, 2006), the findings from the 1980s were no 
longer described as B. burgdorferi, but rather as ‘spirochetes’, and 
the authors proposed that the spirochetes previously detected in 
A. americanum were B. lonestari, not B. burgdorferi. The finding of 
larval pools infected with spirochetes in Schulze et al. (1986) further 
suggests that the organism was the transovarially transmitted relaps-
ing fever spirochete B. lonestari, rather than B. burgdorferi, which 
has not been found to be vertically transmitted by ticks (Stromdahl 
et al. 2003, Rollend et al. 2013). Investigation of A. americanum 
adults in Schulze et al. (2005), using PCR with primers designed to 
amplify all Borrelia spp. (Barbour et al. 1996), followed by sequenc-
ing of representative positive amplicons to confirm the species, 
reported 9.1% (11/121) infected with B. lonestari and none infected 
with B. burgdorferi. Another investigation of A. americanum adults 
by Schulze et al. (2006), using primers for B. burgdorferi/B. lones-
tari (Stegall-Faulk et al. 2003), followed by sequencing of amplicons, 
revealed 5.8% (6/103) infected with B. lonestari and none infected 
with B. burgdorferi.
Investigations of A. americanum from North Carolina 
and Virginia
Magnarelli et al. (1986), a group of researchers from Connecticut 
and North Carolina, examined A. americanum collected from white-
tailed deer in North Carolina by DFA staining using FITC-labeled 
rabbit antibody against B. burgdorferi and detected Borrelia spi-
rochetes in 1.4% (7/512) of the ticks. White-tailed deer are reser-
voir incompetent for B. burgdorferi (Telford et al. 1988) and are 
also zooprophylactic, likely because deer blood complement lyses 
B. burgdorferi in feeding ticks (Bouchard et al. 2013, Roome et al. 
2017). Although B. burgdorferi is sometimes detected in I. scapula-
ris collected from deer, these are likely fragments of dead or dying 
spirochetes, or another species more able to remain viable in white-
tailed deer, such as Borrelia miyamotoi sp. nov. (Spirocheatales: Sp
irochaetaceae) (Han et al. 2016) or B. lonestari (Moyer et al. 2006, 
Varela-Stokes 2007). DFA and polyclonal rabbit antiserum used in 
these analyses are liable to cross-react with other Borrelia spp. or 
identify dead and degraded B. burgdorferi spirochetes.
Levine et al. (1989), from North Carolina State University, used 
darkfield microscopy and DFA with polyclonal antisera to screen 
1,836 North Carolina A. americanum adults and nymphs collected 
in 1984–1987 from vegetation. Spirochetes were found in nine 
A. americanum ticks using darkfield microscopy, but only one tick 
reacted to the polyclonal antisera. This same research group next 
removed ticks from hosts and vegetation in North Carolina and 
Virginia in 1987 and examined them for Borrelia with IFA using 
a B. burgdorferi species-specific MAb H5332 (Levine et al. 1991). 
Borrelia was not detected in 151 questing A. americanum, but was 
found in 6.0% (4/67) of A. americanum removed from animals (four 
larvae removed from two raccoons). The MAb H5332 was designed 
to be specific for B. burgdorferi (Barbour et al. 1983b) and has been 
found to be nonreactive with B. lonestari (Varela et al. 2004a), so, 
as is always the case for detection of pathogens in engorged ticks 
collected from hosts, this might indicate spirochetes or their rem-
nants in host blood, rather than viable infection of the tick itself. 
Sonenshine et al. (1995), at Old Dominion University, collected ticks 
from vegetation and animal hosts at several sites in eastern Virginia 
in 1991–1994 and used darkfield microscopy and IFA with MAb 
H5332 to detect B. burgdorferi in 0.2% (1/546) of A. americanum. 
Ticks examined in this study were either questing or removed from 
animal hosts; the origin of the positive tick was not specified in the 
article, so it is possible the spirochetes came from host blood.
The North Carolina State University group again collected 
A. americanum from raccoons and by flagging vegetation in North 
Carolina from 1990 to 1993 (Ouellette et al. 1997). Examination by 
IFA using B. burgdorferi-specific MAb H5332 revealed a very low 
prevalence of spirochetes, 0.2% (6/2,985 in the questing ticks), and a 
slightly higher prevalence of 1.7% (45/2,739) in ticks removed from 
raccoons. These investigators also sampled the raccoons and were 
able to culture spirochetes from the blood of 26% (23/87) of the 
animals; however, none of the IFA-positive ticks were removed from 
culture-positive raccoons. The spirochetes detected in the questing 
ticks may have been undigested fragments of spirochetes from previ-
ous infected bloodmeals (Allan et al. 2010, Bockenstedt et al. 2012).
Investigations of A. americanum from Texas
Investigations in 1988–1989 by the Texas Department of Health 
reported isolation of spirochetes identified by culture in 3/354 
A. americanum pools collected from vegetation, animal hosts, and 
humans in Texas (Teltow et al. 1991). These cultured spirochetes 
were inoculated into mice in preparation for testing the vector com-
petence of three human-biting tick species, including A. americanum. 
However, the isolates proved not to be infectious for mice, so vector 
competence trials were precluded. These isolates had pulsed field gel 
electrophoretic patterns and plasmid profiles that were indistinguish-
able from high-passage B. burgdorferi strain B31, which is suggestive 
of cross-contamination of cultures during primary isolation (Piesman 
and Happ 1997). In a second study of A. americanum collected from 
vegetation and animal hosts by the same research group (Rawlings 
and Teltow 1994), spirochetes were detected in 1.0% (54/5,195) of 
ticks using DFA testing that did not discriminate among Borrelia 
species. Attempts to culture spirochetes from additional ticks col-
lected in this study failed. Spirochetes in A. americanum collected 
in this study were also used in the first investigation and description

 of B. lonestari, where authors (including G. J. Teltow, author of the 
reports mentioned in this paragraph) proposed that ‘the majority if 
not all of the spirochetes previously noted in A. americanum ticks 
were B. lonestari sp. nov. and not B. burgdorferi’ (Barbour et al. 
1996). In more recent studies of human-biting ticks submitted to the 
Texas Department of State Health Services, all spirochetes found by 
PCR in A. americanum were determined by nucleotide sequencing to 
be B. lonestari, including 0.8% (4/367) in 2004–2008 (Williamson 
et al. 2010) and 1.4% (8/591) in 2008–2014 (Mitchell et al. 2016). 
In another investigation of A. americanum from Texas, Yuan (2010), 
at University of Texas at Houston, reported B. lonestari, and no B. 
burgdorferi, in 1.5% (3/186) of ticks tested by PCR and multilocus 
sequence typing (MLST).
Investigations of A. americanum from Alabama and 
Mississippi
Luckhart et al. (1991), of Auburn University, detected spirochetes in 
4.0% (6/150) of A. americanum removed in 1988 and 1989 from 
white-tailed deer and vegetation in Alabama using DFA and IFA 
with anti-B. burgdorferi PAb, which are not B. burgdorferi-specific 
tests (as described above). The six positive ticks were recovered 
feeding on deer, so detection of other Borrelia species or frag-
ments of dead spirochetes cannot be ruled out. In another Alabama 
study using DFA and IFA with anti-B. burgdorferi PAb, the same 
Auburn University group reported spirochetes from 6.4% (8/125) 
of A. americanum removed from hunter-killed deer (three of the 
positives were from the same deer), but again, the species identity of 
these spirochetes was not established (Luckhart et al. 1992). Almost 
a decade later, Auburn researchers used Borrelia genus-wide prim-
ers and sequencing (Barbour et al. 1996) to identify 1.0% (2/202) 
of questing A. americanum as being infected with B. lonestari, not 
B. burgdorferi; PCR of these ticks using B. burgdorferi-specific prim-
ers was negative (Burkot et al. 2001).
Collaborators from the CDC and the Mississippi Department 
of Health used DFA to examine 68 A. americanum collected 
in 1999 and 2000 from vegetation, deer, dogs, and humans in 
Mississippi; none were positive for Borrelia spp. spirochetes 
(Goddard et al. 2003).
Investigations of A. americanum from Arkansas
A U.S. Army entomology group examined ticks collected from vegeta-
tion, human, and animal hosts in Arkansas in 1990 using IFA with 
the B. burgdoferi-specific MAb H5332 (Kardatzke et al. 1992). No 
B. burgdoferi infections were detected in 471 A. americanum. Selected 
samples of IFA-negative ticks were also tested using DFA and FITC-
labeled rabbit anti-B. burgdorferi PAb to determine whether other 
spirochetes were missed by the more specific test, and none were 
detected. Simpson and Hinck (1993), Arkansas State University, also 
investigated A. americanum from Arkansas for B. burgdorferi. Two 
hundred A. americanum were collected in 1989–1991 from vegetation 
and animal hosts and were first examined for spirochetes by darkfield 
microscopy. Those slides on which spirochetes were detected were then 
examined using IFA with MAb H5332. Spirochetes were observed 
in five females and two nymphs of 200 (3.5%) A. americanum, and 
authors reported that the majority of the IFA-positive A. americanum 
were collected from vegetation. Again, this might indicate spirochetes 
or their remnants in host blood, rather than viable infection of the tick 
itself (Allan et al. 2010, Bockenstedt et al. 2012). Simpson and Hinck 
did not provide details of IFA methods and reference an article that 
describes DFA (Anderson and Magnarelli 1984); therefore, it is not 
possible to evaluate their precautions to avoid false positives.
Investigations of A. americanum from Missouri
Using IFA with MAb H5332, Feir et al. (1994) visualized spirochetes 
in 1.9% (33/1752) of A. americanum collected from vegetation in 
1989 in Missouri, and subsequent PCR of the tick smear material 
from the IFA slides amplified B. burgdorferi in a number of these 
ticks (both Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (Acari: Ixodidae) and 
A. americanum were investigated, but the number of PCR-positive 
of each species is not reported). However, the PCR was not con-
gruent with the IFA results; some IFA-negative samples were PCR-
positive, and some IFA-positive samples were PCR negative. Perhaps 
the concentration of the secondary antibody, at a 1:20 dilution, was 
high enough to cross-react with other Borrelia species. Although 
two primer sets, one for a 371 bp chromosomal target, and one 
for 16S rRNA, were used on a sample of the A. americanum ticks, 
B. burgdorferi was only amplified using the chromosomal target 
PCR. Sequencing was performed on only one A. americanum tick 
smear PCR amplicon. A contemporaneous critique of this article 
questioned the author’s methods and conclusions because B. burg-
dorferi was never isolated from the ticks and their PCR analysis used 
material removed from IFA slides, not ticks (Nelson 1995). Two sub-
sequent articles, both co-authored by E. M. Masters, also an author 
of Feir et al. (1994), cite the Feir article as evidence of B. lonestari, 
not B. burgdorferi stating ‘Approximately 2% of A. americanum 
ticks are infected with a spirochete different from both B. burgdor-
feri and the other Borrelia genospecies recognized as causes of Lyme 
disease in Eurasia. Barbour et al. proposed the name B. lonestari 
species novum. This borrelial species appears to be closely related to 
B. theileri, the cause of bovine borreliosis.’ (Wormser et al. 2005b). 
The second article (Wormser et al. 2005a) contains a similar state-
ment. In the face of the inadequate evidence from the Feir article 
itself, and the re-evaluation of the results by co-author Masters, it 
is remarkable that this article continues to be cited as support for 
the role of A. americanum in the transmission of B. burgdorferi 
(Rudenko et al. 2016).
Four subsequent investigations of Missouri A. americanum using 
PCR found only B. lonestari and no B. burgdorferi. Researchers 
from Georgia Southern University tested A. americanum collected 
from animals and vegetation in Missouri in 1995 and 1996 with 
IFA using both PAb and MAb (H5332). Five ticks (5/436 = 1.1%) 
were positive with the PAb, but negative with the MAb, and authors 
suggested that this might indicate infection with B. lonestari (Kollars 
et al. 2000). A study by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) and U.S. Army investigators using PCR primers for both 
the 16S rDNA and the flaB gene of all Borreliae (Barbour et al. 
1996), plus sequencing, identified a minimum infection rate of 5.6% 
(12/214) for B. lonestari and no B. burgdorferi in pools of A. ameri-
canum adults and nymphs (Bacon et al. 2003). Additional analysis of 
another population of Missouri A. americanum by the same research 
team revealed only B. lonestari; all 654 (114 pools) of A. america-
num were tested using primers specific for B. lonestari and also prim-
ers specific for the ospA gene of B. burgdorferi (Demaerschalck et al. 
1995). Twenty-two pools (yielding a maximum likelihood estimate 
of 3.8% [22/654]) were positive for B. lonestari with none positive 
for B. burgdorferi (Bacon et al. 2005). In 2010, a Missouri team 
from Washington University and St. Louis Children’s Hospital exam-
ined 1,383 questing nymphal A. americanum using PCR that ampli-
fied the 16SrDNA gene of B. lonestari and B. burgdorferi and the 
23S-5S intergenic spacer region of B. burgdorferi; 1.3% (18/1383) 
contained B. lonestari, and none were positive for B. burgdorferi 
(Allan et al. 2010). In yet another study of ticks from Missouri, Yuan 
(2010) investigated A. americanum adults collected from vegetation

 and detected neither B. burgdorferi nor B. lonestari in 42 ticks using 
primers that amplified the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region, the recG 
gene and the uvrA gene of B. burgdorferi and B. lonestari.
Two other studies of Missouri A. americanum report PCR 
detection of Borrelia spp. and B. burgdorferi (Cyr et al. 2005, 
Hudman and Sargentini 2016), but problems with methodology 
undermine the credibility of these results. Cyr et al. (2005) pre-
sent insufficient evidence to support their report of B. burgdorferi 
in a small sample of A. americanum collected from vegetation, 
humans, and dogs. Oddly, sequencing of the positive amplicons is 
described in the Materials and Methods section, but results of the 
sequencing are not reported. Detection of 4 of 16 A. americanum 
positive for B. burgdorferi was remarkable, and some explanation 
of these findings should have been put forward. Hudman and 
Sargentini (2016), of A.T. Still University, investigated A. ameri-
canum collected from vegetation in Missouri and described de-
tection of B. burgdorferi in 0.3% (5/1,880) of adult and nymphal 
ticks using the primers from Barbour et al. (1996) and sequencing. 
However, the authors recognized that the evidence of one gene 
only was insufficient to confirm the identity of B. burgdorferi and 
therefore reported these samples as positive for Borrelia spp. only. 
Furthermore, the primers used were not specific for B. burgdor-
feri; both internal and external primer sets of the nested PCR used 
in this study would amplify Borrelia spp. other than B. burgdor-
feri (Barbour et al. 1996).
Investigations of A. americanum from South Carolina
A group from Georgia Southern University attempted culture of 
Borrelia from 210 A. americanum adults collected from vegetation 
in South Carolina in 1994 and 1995, but no isolations were obtained 
(Clark et al. 2002).
T
ransmission/Vector Competency T
rials
Arthropod species may be incompetent as vectors for a pathogen 
for three possible reasons: 1) failure to acquire the pathogen while 
feeding on an infected host; 2) inability of the pathogen to persist 
in the vector; or 3) inability of the tick to subsequently transmit the 
pathogen to another vertebrate host even if the arthropod can ac-
quire and maintain infection (Ledin et al. 2005). Since 1988, there 
have been nine studies to our knowledge using animal experiments 
to assess vector competence of A. americanum for B. burgdorferi, 
and in none was vector competence demonstrated. The strains of 
B. burgdorferi used in these trials have been diverse and from a 
wide range of geographic areas. Five of these animal transmission 
experiments used strains of B. burgdorferi from northeastern Lyme 
disease-endemic areas, JDI and SH2-82 (Piesman and Sinsky 1988, 
Mather and Mather 1990, Mukolwe et al. 1992, Ryder et al. 1992, 
Soares et al. 2006). One experiment used the SI-1 strain of B. burg-
dorferi from a cotton mouse and I. scapularis ticks from Georgia 
(Oliver et al. 1993). Another experiment used the MI-6 strain of 
B. burgdorferi from Florida (later identified as Borrelia bissettii 
sp. nov. (Spirocheatales: Spirochaetaceae) by Lin et al. 2002), the 
northeastern strain SH2-82 as a positive control, and ticks collected 
in Georgia (Sanders and Oliver 1995). Another study involved 34 
strains isolated from the northeastern, southeastern, midwestern, 
Rocky Mountain, Pacific, and southwestern regions (Piesman and 
Happ 1997). In two of these experiments, A. americanum larvae 
acquired spirochetes during feeding upon infectious hosts, but all 
of these larvae became spirochete-negative before molting to the 
nymphal stage (Piesman and Sinsky 1988, Mather and Mather 
1990). In another study involving A. americanum larvae fed on 
hamsters infected with B. burgdorferi, a single nymph (1 per 60 
nymphs) retained infection through the molt and was positive by 
IFA for B. burgdorferi. However, nymphal A. americanum that 
had fed on infected hosts did not transmit infection when fed on 
uninfected hamsters (Ryder et al. 1992). In one study, researchers 
not only fed A. americanum larvae by themselves on infected mice 
but also fed A. americanum and I. scapularis together on the mice. 
Co-feeding with I. scapularis significantly increased bacterial uptake 
by A. americanum during feeding, but no spirochetes were detect-
able in the A. americanum by 14 d after feeding (Soares et al. 2006). 
 
There has been no successful transmission of B. burgdorferi be-
tween infected and naïve hosts by A. americanum (Mukolwe et al. 
1992, Ryder et al. 1992, Oliver et al. 1993, Sanders and Oliver 1995, 
Piesman and Happ 1997). In all nine studies, successful experimental 
transmission of B. burgdorferi by I. scapularis acted as a positive 
control on the experimental conditions. Subsequently, discovery of a 
protein in the saliva of A. americanum that destroyed B. burgdorferi 
has provided a biological explanation for the observed lack of vector 
competency suggesting that the incompetency of A. americanum is 
mostly due to their inability to acquire viable B. burgdorferi spiro-
chetes (Ledin et al. 2005, Zeidner et al. 2009).
Discovery of B. lonestari and Surveillance for 
Borrelia spp. in A. americanum Using PCR
Repeated detection of Borrelia in A. americanum with microscopy 
and immunofluorescent methods (described above) – juxtaposed 
with repeated failure of A. americanum to maintain and transmit 
B. burgdorferi in laboratory studies – strongly suggested infection 
of A. americanum by a distinct Borrelia species. Evidence of this 
hypothesized novel Borrelia species was first published in 1996 
for A. americanum from Maryland (Armstrong et al. 1996) and 
from Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Texas 
(Barbour et al. 1996). Researchers from Harvard School of Public 
Health conducted a detailed epidemiological/entomological study of 
ticks and tick-bite victims in Maryland and investigated A. ameri-
canum using IFA with polyclonal rabbit antiserum to B. burgdor-
feri sensu lato, which identified spirochetes in 1.0% (7/685) of ticks 
(Armstrong et al. 2001). These IFA-positive samples were analyzed 
using fla gene PCR, and amplicon sequencing plus phylogenetic ana-
lysis revealed a spirochete close to the relapsing fever spirochete 
Borrelia theileri (Laveran) (Spirocheatales: Spirochaetaceae), which 
later was identified as B. lonestari. None of the ticks contained 
B. burgdorferi, and attempts to cultivate the spirochete in BSK II 
and Kelly’s medium failed (Armstrong et al. 1996, Rich et al. 2001). 
Another research group also conducted molecular analyses of the 
Borrelia detected in A. americanum from a variety of locations 
and described the spirochete as B. lonestari (Barbour et al. 1996); 
Borrelia sequences detected in A. americanum by both groups were 
identical (Rich et al. 2001).
The description of B. lonestari (Armstrong et al. 1996, Barbour 
et al. 1996, Rich et al. 2001) and its detection in both an A. america-
num tick removed from a patient suffering a skin rash and the super-
natant of the patient’s skin biopsy sample (James et al. 2001) raised 
the possibility of B. lonestari being the etiologic agent of a condition 
that became known as STARI (Masters et al. 2008). This prompted 
numerous PCR surveys of Borrelia in A. americanum throughout its 
range. Many of the investigators screened ticks using broadly reac-
tive or generic Borrelia primers, often flaB gene nested primers from 
the article first describing B. lonestari (Barbour et al. 1996). These 
primers amplify Borrelia strains potentially associated with human 
illness, including Borrelia americana sp. nov. (Spirocheatales: Spiro

 chaetaceae), Borrelia andersonii sp. nov. (Spirocheatales: Spirochae
taceae), and B. bissettii (Stromdahl et al. 2015), as well as B. burg-
dorferi, B. lonestari and B. miyamotoi. Other research teams used 
different primer sets specific for B. lonestari and for B. burgdorferi.
Ultimately, no further human case studies linked B. lonestari with 
STARI patients, and it is no longer thought to be a human pathogen 
(Philipp et al. 2006; Wormser et al. 2005a,b). Nevertheless, the sur-
veillance performed in these numerous studies, summarized in Table 2, 
provides extensive evidence of the absence of B. burgdorferi in A. amer-
icanum. Over 33,000 A. americanum, from locations throughout the 
range of the tick, have been tested for Borrelia spp. in this manner in 
37 studies from more than 25 research groups, yielding a prevalence 
of ~1.7% of B. lonestari. In six of these surveys, from four research 
groups, PCR detection of 35 samples (~0.1%) positive for B. burgdor-
feri was reported. Only three of these PCR-positives from one study 
were characterized in detail (Rudenko et al. 2016), and laboratory con-
tamination was suspected in another (Stromdahl et al. 2001, 2015).
Investigations Identifying Only B. lonestari and Not 
B. burgdorferi Using Primers From Barbour et al. 
(1996) and Sequencing of All Amplicons
Nine of the surveys, from seven different research groups from seven 
states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, 
and Texas), using flagellin gene primers from Barbour et al. (1996) 
and sequencing of all amplicons, identified B. lonestari and no other 
Borrelia spp. in 1.7% (79/5,771) of A. americanum removed from vege-
tation and humans (Burkot et al. 2001, Bacon et al. 2003, Varela et al. 
2004b, Williamson et al. 2010, Gleim 2013, Maegli et al. 2016, Gleim 
et al. 2016, Mitchell et al. 2016, Sayler et al. 2016). Bacon et al. (2003) 
took extra steps to verify their results by using an additional PCR for 
a Borrelia genus-specific 16S rRNA gene and a PCR for B. burgdorferi 
ospA as a control for false positives. Similarly, Mitchell et al. (2016) 
tested all A. americanum in their study with primers for the 16S rDNA 
of genus Borrelia, and, as with the PCR with the primers from Barbour 
et al. (1996), none were found positive for B. burgdorferi. Sayler and 
the University of Florida research group cited above conducted a second 
study using the primers from Barbour et al. (1996) to investigate 777 
additional Florida A. americanum, and none of the ticks tested were 
positive (Sayler et al. 2017). To investigate the possibility of false nega-
tives in this study, genomic DNA from all tested tick specimens was 
visualized on agarose gels and quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer; 
intact, high molecular weight DNA was verified in all samples.
Investigations Identifying Only B. lonestari and Not 
B. burgdorferi Using Primers From Barbour et al. 
(1996) and Multilocus PCR Electrospray Ionization 
Mass Spectrometry
In another study, from U.S. Army entomology (Stromdahl and 
Hickling 2012), 1,621 A. americanum removed from humans were 
tested using the primers from Barbour et al. (1996). This effort 
yielded 24 Borrelia-positive samples that were then tested further 
using specific PCRs for B. lonestari (Bacon et al. 2004) and B. burg-
dorferi (Straubinger 2000). Nine of 1,621 (0.6%) were positive in 
the B. lonestari PCR, but none were positive for B. burgdorferi. Ten 
of the 15 tick samples that were positive in the generic Borrelia PCR, 
but negative in both the B. lonestari and B. burgdorferi-specific 
PCRs, were sent to Ibis Biosciences for further analysis using a multi-
locus PCR electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) 
Borrelia identification and genotyping assay (Crowder et al. 2010). 
PCR/ESI-MS analysis determined that two samples were Borrelia-
negative and four were positive for B. lonestari. The remaining three 
samples, and one of the B. lonestari-positive samples, were positive 
for the B. burgdorferi flagellin primer but negative for seven other 
Borrelia primers. Attempts to clone and sequence the flagellin ampli-
con from these samples were unsuccessful. The PCR/ESI-MS assay 
targets the same region of the flagellin gene used in the initial screen-
ing (Barbour et al. 1996), so amplicon contamination from the posi-
tive control could have been responsible for these flagellin primer 
detections. In total, 0.8% (13/1,621) of A. americanum adults and 
nymphs were confirmed positive for B. lonestari by multiple PCRs, 
three suspects were amplicon contamination or perhaps amplifica-
tion of remnants of Borrelia, five suspects were not identified to spe-
cies, and no B. burgdorferi was found.
Investigations Identifying Only B. lonestari and No 
B. burgdorferi Using Primers From Barbour et al. 
(1996) and Sequencing of a Selection of Amplicons
Seven of the studies in Table 2 also involved the use of flagellin gene 
primers from Barbour et al. (1996) and reported detection of B. lon-
estari only, and no B. burgdorferi, in 2.1% (297/13,858) of A. amer-
icanum from human, animals, and vegetation, but in these cases, 
only representative amplicons were sequenced, so detection of other 
Borrelia cannot be ruled out. Most of these researchers (Stromdahl 
et al. 2003; Schulze et al. 2005, 2011; Mixson et al. 2006; Castellaw 
et al. 2010; Killmaster et al. 2014) reported all PCR-positives as 
B. lonestari. Fryxell et al. (2012) sequenced 66% (107/161) of the 
amplicons from PCR-positive ticks and reported those not sequenced 
as ‘Borrelia spp.’.
U.S. Army entomologists (Stromdahl et al. 2003) investigated 
ticks from the entire geographic range of A. americanum in the 
United States and detected 78 Borrelia positives. Of these, 68 were 
sequenced, and all were B. lonestari. Furthermore, all 78 of these 
positive samples tested negative in a PCR specific for B. burgdorferi 
ospA (Rosa et al. 1991). Mixson et al. (2006), from CDC and other 
academic and public health laboratories, used the Barbour flagel-
lin primers to investigate A. americanum from nine states: Florida, 
Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, 
Rhode Island, and South Carolina. 
Ticks from all states except Florida, 
Iowa, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island were PCR-positive. Only selected 
samples were sequenced, and all were identified as B. lonestari. 
Similarly, New Jersey public heath entomologists detected Borrelia in 
A. americanum from New Jersey using the Barbour flagellin primers, 
selected samples were sequenced, and all were identified as B. lon-
estari (Schulze et al. 2005, 2011). Castellaw et al. (2010) used the 
same primers to test A. americanum from Mississippi and detected 
Borrelia in 2.6% (5/191) of the ticks. Three of these were sequenced 
and were identified as B. lonestari. Killmaster et al. (2014) also used 
the Barbour primers to test 4,236 A. americanum from Georgia and 
reported 59 ticks positive for B. lonestari and none for B. burgdor-
feri, but only 10% were confirmed by sequencing.
Fryxell et al. (2012) used the primers from Barbour et al. (1996) 
to test 657 A. americanum removed from deer and dogs in Arkansas. 
Of these, 161 produced amplicons and sequencing of 107 identified 
all as B. lonestari, and none as B. burgdorferi. A single unidentified 
nymphal Amblyomma spp. removed from a deer was identified by 
sequencing as B. burgdorferi; however, over 100 ticks of another 
Amblyomma species, Amblyomma maculatum Koch (Acari: 
Ixodidae), were collected from deer and dogs in this survey, and 
B. burgdorferi was identified and confirmed by sequencing in two of 
these, so it cannot be assumed that the tick was A. americanum. This 
was the first reported detection of B. burgdorferi in A. maculatum, 
and a subsequent PCR study examining unfed ticks was undertaken

 to investigate the potential of this tick to transmit B. burgdorferi 
(Lee et al. 2014). In this study, no B. burgdorferi was detected in 
PCR of 306 adult A. maculatum using primer sets for both the flaB 
and 16S rRNA genes, and 97 adult A. maculatum using only the 16S 
rRNA PCR. However, two ticks contained a novel reptile-associated 
Borrelia. This suggests that the B. burgdorferi found in the Fryxell 
study had been acquired during the bloodmeal and was not being 
maintained by the tick.
Investigations Identifying No B. burgdorferi Using 
Primers Other than Barbour et al. (1996)
Nine reports of A. americanum describing the detection of only 
B. lonestari (and no other Borrelia spp.), or no Borrelia, used 
primer sets other than those of Barbour et al. (1996), and together 
they revealed a B. lonestari prevalence of 1.3% (96/7372; Stegall-
Faulk et al. 2003, Bacon et al. 2005, Schulze et al. 2006, Jordan 
et al. 2009, Allan et al. 2010, Yuan 2010, Fritzen et al. 2011, 
Stromdahl et al. 2015, https://www.tickreport.com/stats (Accessed 
26 September 2017).
Primers designed by researchers at Middle Tennessee State 
University that amplify the flagellin gene of B. lonestari and B. burg-
dorferi were used to test Tennessee A. americanum (Stegall-Faulk 
et al. 2003). Two of 453 (0.4%) were positive at the gel band size 
indicating B. lonestari, and identity of both as B. lonestari was con-
firmed with dot blot hybridization of PCR products. One of the sam-
ples was sequenced to further confirm identity. Bacon et al. (2005) 
tested 114 pools (654 total ticks) of A. americanum using primers 
specific for B. lonestari and also primers specific for the ospA gene 
of B. burgdorferi (Demaerschalck et al. 1995). Twenty-two pools 
were positive for B. lonestari with none positive for B. burgdorferi. 
Schulze et al. (2006) also used the primers from Stegall-Faulk et al. 
(2003) to test A. americanum from New Jersey. Six of 103 (5.8%) 
A. americanum samples produced gel bands at the size indicating 
B. lonestari, and none were positive for B. burgdorferi. All six sam-
ples were sequenced to confirm identity. Different flagellin primers 
designed by the Middle Tennessee State University research group to 
amplify both B. lonestari and B. burgdorferi were used to test 399 
A. americanum collected in Tennessee, but no tick samples were pos-
itive for either target (Jordan et al. 2009). As described earlier in this 
review, the Missouri team from Washington University and St. Louis 
Children’s Hospital examined 1,383 A. americanum using PCR for 
B. lonestari and B. burgdorferi; 1.3% (18/1383) contained B. lones-
tari, and none were positive for B. burgdorferi (Allan et al. 2010). 
Universal 16S rDNA primers (Pichon et al. 2003) and primers for 
the 23S-5S intergenic spacer of Borrelia (Rijpkema et al. 1995) were 
used for the PCR screen, and a reverse line blot assay for B. burgdor-
feri and B. lonestari reconfirmed the positives.
Yuan (2010) at University of Texas at Houston used primers 
designed to amplify the 16S-23S intergenic spacer of both B. burg-
dorferi and B. lonestari (Bunikis et al. 2004), plus MLST modified to 
identify the recG and uvrA genes from B. burgdorferi and B. lones-
tari (Margos et al. 2008) and reported B. lonestari in 1.5% (3/186) 
of A. americanum from Texas, no Borrelia in 42 A. americanum 
from Missouri, and no B. burgdorferi in any of these 228 ticks.
A group from the Tennessee Department of Health and the 
Kentucky Department for Public Health also used primers for 
the Borrelia 16S-23S intergenic spacer from Bunikis et al. (2004) 
to detect B. lonestari in 0.9% (1/108), and no B. burgdorferi in 
A. americanum collected from animals in Kentucky. The identity of 
the Borrelia spp. in this sample of ticks was confirmed by sequenc-
ing. These ticks were also assessed with B. burgdorferi-specific ospA 
primers from Demaerschalck et al. (1995), and none of the ticks 
were positive (Fritzen et al. 2011).
Researchers from U.S. Army entomology, CDC, two academic 
laboratories, and Ibis Biosciences used Borrelia flagellin gene prim-
ers from Clark et al. (2013) to screen 1,097 A. americanum removed 
from humans throughout the range of the tick (Stromdahl et al. 
2015). Nine suspect-positives (five pools and four individuals) were 
all confirmed as B. lonestari by subsequent PCRs targeting the 16S 
rRNA qPCR for Borrelia (Tsao et al. 2004), the 16S-23S intergenic 
spacer region of Borrelia (Bunikis et al. 2004), and in the eight 
Borrelia PCRs of the Ibis Biosciences PCR/ESI-MS system (Crowder 
et al. 2010).
The Laboratory of Medical Zoology (LMZ) at the University 
of Massachusetts offers a tick identification and pathogen testing 
service. The crowd-sourced program provides a public surveillance 
database of human-biting ticks, their feeding status, and submitted 
and tested by LMZ (https://www.tickreport.com/stats). From 2006 
until 2017, the LMZ tested 2,483 human-biting A. americanum for 
B. burgdorferi using a TaqMan qPCR assay (Xu et al. 2016). None 
of these A. americanum were positive for B. burgdorferi, while 31 
(1.11%) were positive for B. lonestari.
Investigations Identifying B. lonestari, 
B. burgdorferi, Or Both in A. americanum
Six of the molecular surveys listed in Table 2 report identification 
of B. burgdorferi in A. americanum (Stromdahl et al. 2001, Clark 
2004, Cyr et al. 2005, Taft et al. 2005, Clark et al. 2013, Rudenko 
et al. 2016). In the earliest article, the B. burgdorferi-positive PCR 
of A. americanum was likely due to contamination, as authors 
explained in subsequent publications (Stromdahl et al. 2001, 2015). 
Four of the surveys that reported B. burgdorferi presented insuf-
ficient evidence (PCR of one gene only, sequencing in one direction 
only, products not sequenced) to definitively confirm the identity of 
the PCR products (Clark 2004, Cyr et al. 2005, Taft et al. 2005, 
Clark et al. 2013). In the sixth study, Rudenko et al. (2016) con-
firmed species identity by MLST/MLSA of up to 10 genes, but only a 
very small number of ticks (3) ticks were so characterized.
Stromdahl et al. (2001) used PCR to investigate A. americanum 
collected in 1997 for B. burgdorferi and reported a minimum infec-
tion rate of 11.7% (26/222), though only 3.2% (7/222) produced 
amplicons in PCRs for two different gene targets. In a later pub-
lication, these PCR results were re-evaluated and contamination 
was suspected because all occurred in the first year of the study 
when PCR was initially implemented, and no positive results were 
obtained across large numbers of samples in all subsequent years 
(Stromdahl et al. 2015). Amplicons from the 1997 tick PCRs were 
not sequenced.
In a study that involved ticks collected from vegetation in Florida, 
Clark (2004) reported detection of B. burgdorferi in 1.3% (5/396) 
of A. americanum. Identity of positive amplicons was confirmed 
by sequencing in one direction only, and the various PCR methods 
used on each positive sample are not precisely described. Of 252 
A. americanum ticks tested using flaB primers from Johnson et al. 
(1992), five tested positive for B. burgdorferi. It appears that these 
were also tested using primers from Barbour et al. (1996, Tables 3 
and 5; Clark 2004), and only one tick was positive for B. burgdor-
feri. Some of the samples positive with the primers from Johnson 
et al. (1992) were tested using nested ospA primers (Guttman et al. 
1996, Guy et al. 1991) and 5S-23S primers (Rijpkema et al. 1995), 
but no A. americanum ticks were positive for B. burgdorferi. Most 
of the samples positive with the primers from Johnson et al. (1992)

 were tested using nested p66 primers (Rosa et al. 1991), and two 
A. americanum were positive for B. burgdorferi.
Cyr et al. (2005), as described earlier in this review, presented 
insufficient evidence to support their report of a improbably high 
incidence of B. burgdorferi in a small sample of A. americanum 
(4/16 = 25%); the 95% confidence interval for finding 4 of 16 ticks 
positive is 0.08–52%. The investigators stated that this occurred be-
cause the tick collections for their study were purposely made in 
areas of Missouri suspected of being ‘hot spots’ for Lyme disease, 
and PCR using the same primers produced positive results testing 
skin biopsies from Missouri patients suspected of having Lyme 
disease. This result is inconsistent with the much larger surveys 
reported here. In the absence of confirmation by another test, this 
report should be viewed cautiously. Novel findings of B. burgdorferi 
in tick species should be supported by characterization of multiple 
gene targets and evaluation of cross-reactivity with other Borrelia, 
but in this instance, only one gene target, 16S rDNA, was used for 
the tick samples and for the human samples that corroborated the 
findings in the tick samples. The sequencing data from the positive 
ticks and skin samples were not presented therefore could not be 
analyzed. A search for articles citing Cyr et al. (2005) identified 
only one other study using these primers and again, authors report 
‘anomalous’ infection rates detected in I. scapularis ticks collected 
in Maryland (Carroll and Cyr 2005). These novel primers should 
have been assessed in conjunction with other, more frequently used, 
assays for Borrelia spp.
Taft et al. (2005) tested ticks using primers of their own design 
targeting the flagellin gene of both B. burgdorferi and B. lonestari 
and reported 1.5% (4/269) of A. americanum positive for B. burg-
dorferi and 2.2% (6/269) positive for B. lonestari. The B. burg-
dorferi-positive A. americanum were two adults and two nymphs 
collected from vegetation. The positive samples were reconfirmed 
via dot blot hybridization with probes internal to the amplicon that 
differentiated B. burgdorferi and B. lonestari; however, the B. burg-
dorferi-positive samples were not sequenced, so these tick are best 
considered ‘suspect-positive’.
Clark et al. (2013) described A. americanum as a vector of the 
agent of Lyme disease and presented as evidence the detection of 
B. burgdorferi by PCR in two A. americanum ticks removed from 
two patients. Confirmation of the identity of B. burgdorferi in 
these two PCR-positive A. americanum relied on the detection and 
sequencing of one gene only (flaB). The 429 nucleotide flaB sequence 
amplified from one of the ticks (collected from Patient 4) was 100% 
identical to the B. burgdorferi B31 PCR control (NC_001318.1 
sequence, GenBank), but was 99.8% (429/430-bp) similar to the 
flaB sequence from the blood of Patient 4 from whom the tick was 
collected. The 456 nucleotide flaB sequence amplified from the other 
tick (collected from Patient 7) was 99.6% (453/455-bp) identical to 
the B31 PCR control and 99.6% (451/453) identical to B. burgdor-
feri in an EM biopsy from Patient 7. The number of sequencing reads 
used to determine their sequences is not stated for this study, so it is 
unclear whether the sequence differences between the patient sam-
ples and the B31 control were real or due to sequencing errors. The 
B. burgdorferi sequences amplified from the Patient 4 blood sample 
and the Patient 7 skin sample did not match those obtained from the 
same patient’s attached A. americanum tick, so there is no evidence 
that the B. burgdorferi DNA found in the patient samples came from 
B. burgdorferi in the attached tick.
Rudenko et al. (2016) reported 2.2% (13/590) of A. america-
num to be PCR-positive using B. burgdorferi flagellin gene primers, 
but MLST of 10 gene targets could only confirm 3 of these posi-
tives, and not all 10 loci were amplified in each of those 3 samples. 
B. burgdorferi is readily amplified from Ixodes spp. ticks; weak 
PCR signals for B. burgdorferi in A. americanum tick samples may 
indicate amplification of remnants of a bloodmeal from a previous 
life stage (Allen et al. 2010, Bockenstedt et al. 2012, Marques et al. 
2014), rather than active infection with viable spirochetes. It should 
also be emphasized that infrequent detection by molecular methods 
of B. burgdorferi DNA in A. americanum does not indicate that 
these ticks are capable of transmission.
Discussion and Conclusions
Early studies suggested the presence of B. burgdorferi in A. ameri-
canum ticks in the United States. However, in almost all cases, 
Borreliae were detected using methods that were not Borrelia spe-
cies-specific; spirochetes that were detected were likely other spe-
cies, or transient infections detected in engorged ticks collected from 
hosts infected with B. burgdorferi transmitted by other sympatric 
vector-competent tick species. More recently, extensive surveillance, 
using methods that discriminate among Borrelia species, has only 
rarely detected B. burgdorferi in A. americanum ticks, and most of 
these observations could have resulted from the presence of B. burg-
dorferi DNA that was most likely from an infectious host bloodmeal. 
Definitive experimental infections using a diverse array of B. burg-
dorferi strains have repeatedly failed to demonstrate vector compe-
tency of A. americanum for B. burgdorferi.
A hypothesis of ‘selective compatibility’—i.e., that certain strains 
of B. burgdorferi in the southeastern United States may be bet-
ter adapted to development in ticks other than Ixodes spp.—was 
proposed by Luckhart et al. (1991). Rudenko et al. (2016) revis-
ited the possible role of A. americanum as a Lyme vector, citing as 
evidence findings of ‘B. burgdorferi’ in A. americanum from New 
Jersey (Schulze et al. 1984), Missouri (Feir et al. 1994), and Texas 
(Teltow et al. 1991). However, authors of these three studies subse-
quently revised their findings to ‘B. lonestari’ (Barbour et al. 1996; 
Schulze et al. 2005, 2006; Wormser et al. 2005a,b). Rudenko et al. 
(2016) reported detecting three questing A. americanum positive 
for B. burgdorferi by PCR and MLST and suggested that when 
compatible spirochete strains meet an appropriate tick population, 
maintenance and transmission could occur. If so, then these strains 
are likely very rare, as transmission did not occur in two laboratory 
experiments involving A. americanum and B. burgdorferi strains 
from the region of origin of these positive ticks (Oliver et al. 1993, 
Sanders and Oliver 1995). Borrelia burgdorferi has never been suc-
cessfully cultured from A. americanum; motile spirochetes have 
never been described from A. americanum, and the studies reviewed 
in Tables 1 and 2 report no conclusive evidence of B. burgdorferi 
infection in extensive surveillance of more than 52,000 A. america-
num. Throughout the entire range of A. americanum (Springer et al. 
2014), the tick is constantly being exposed to Borreliae, although 
sympatric tick populations and host species compositions change. 
By some mechanism, most likely borreliacidal salivary components, 
the tick resists colonization by B. burgdorferi. While the existence of 
some compatible spirochete strains and A. americanum tick popula-
tions cannot be entirely ruled out, how transmission cycles could 
be maintained in nature at the vanishingly low prevalence levels 
detected in surveillance of A. americanum ticks remains an impor-
tant question that needs to be addressed.
PCR and other detection methods have limitations when trying to 
answer the question of whether or not A. americanum has the ability 
to transmit/vector B. burgdorferi to humans. Most important to note 
is that the detection of Borrelia DNA does not mean living Borrelia

 are present. It has been shown that pieces of dead B. burgdorferi can 
elicit antigenic responses that are identified by immunofluorescent 
staining, and contain DNA that can be detected by PCR (Bockenstedt 
et al. 2012), and DNA from the blood cells of a previous host blood-
meal often persists through the tick’s molt and has been detected in 
between 45 and 63% of questing nymphal and adult A. americanum 
ticks (Allan et al. 2010, Harmon et al. 2015). Therefore, the rare 
detection of B. burgdorferi DNA in questing A. americanum should 
not be over-interpreted, and these rare detections need to be put in 
context with the comparatively high prevalence of infection in quest-
ing ticks of species known to be vector-competent. PCR data alone 
may reveal pathogen DNA, but the more useful information remains 
unknown, including whether the DNA came from live or dead bac-
teria within the tick’s body, or dead bacteria residing in the tick’s 
midgut that are remnants of the tick’s last meal.
The possibility of false-positive test results is increased when 
using PCR (particularly nested PCR) to detect bacterial DNA 
because the products of DNA amplification that give the test result 
can be due to contamination or false priming if the PCR protocol is 
not sufficiently stringent (Lo and Chan 2006). There is greater con-
fidence in PCR test results when multiple PCR targets are used and 
when amplicons are sequenced. Careful review of sequences of PCR 
amplicons is needed to rule out the possibility of contamination of 
PCR reactions by DNA from positive controls and strains grown in 
the laboratory, and to ensure that there is no carry-over contamina-
tion from other tested samples. PCR, sequencing, and analysis of 
highly variable DNA genes or multiple genes can assist in assuring 
that DNA contamination did not occur with the positive DNA con-
trol or other lab strains if they do not match the sequences of these 
strains. DNA sequencing should be done on both strands of a PCR 
product, and if Sanger sequencing is employed, a sufficiently large 
number of reads should be used to determine the consensus sequence 
to assure sequencing errors did not occur.
Confirmation of a suspect-positive result by reproducing the result 
with multiple real-time PCR assays can have benefits. The ability to 
consistently reproduce positive results with other assays is suggestive 
that PCR amplicon contamination has not been occurring, but it can-
not rule out genomic DNA contamination of a sample. Proper DNA 
extraction controls, PCR controls, and sequencing are needed to do 
this. Performing real-time PCR assays instead of standard or nested 
PCR in general reduces the likelihood that amplicon contamination 
will occur since the PCR products do not need to be pipetted from 
an open tube in order to be used in downstream PCRs or run on an 
agarose gel, both of which increase the chance of laboratory contam-
ination with PCR products. In addition, real-time PCR assays that use 
a standard curve can provide information on the approximate DNA 
copy number present in a tick so as to provide information on whether 
the detected pathogen is present in biologically meaningful numbers.
Successful culture isolation of B. burgdorferi from a tick removed 
from an animal host does not distinguish between exposure to 
B. burgdorferi in the bloodmeal versus active infection of the tick, 
nor does it determine whether the spirochetes would survive transta-
dially until the tick feeds again at the next life stage, or be success-
fully transmitted to a new host during the next bloodmeal.
Culturing of host-seeking ticks, or of ticks removed from hosts and 
allowed to molt to the next life stage before culturing, could answer the 
question of whether some strains of B. burgdorferi can live through a 
molt. Transmission studies would then be required to verify whether 
these ticks could transmit the spirochete to their next bloodmeal host.
The role of A. americanum in the transmission of Lyme disease 
remains controversial in the minds of a very few scientists, yet public 
sentiment has kept the possibility of ‘Lyme disease from lone star 
ticks’ in the spotlight. Although advancements in molecular analysis 
strongly suggest that initial reports of B. burgdorferi in A. america-
num across many states were in fact misidentified B. lonestari or DNA 
contamination, early reports continue to be cited without mention of 
the later clarifying studies; consequently, the search for a population 
of A. americanum that can transmit the Lyme disease spirochete has 
been ongoing. We suggest that the few studies implicating A. ameri-
canum as a vector of B. burgdorferi have not yet met the burden of 
proof for their assumption. This review of extensive surveillance and 
vector competency studies of B. burgdorferi in A. americanum stud-
ies supports the conclusion that A. americanum is not a consequen-
tial factor in Lyme disease ecology and epidemiology. Information 
pertaining to the geographical distribution of infected ticks is quite 
important so that practicing physicians adopt the appropriate level 
of concern in a given patient population. There is no epidemiological 
need whatsoever to invoke another vector to explain Lyme disease 
prevalence and distribution in the United States.
