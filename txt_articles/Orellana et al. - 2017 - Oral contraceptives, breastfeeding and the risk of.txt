AbstrACt
Objectives to study whether oral contraceptive 
(oC) use or breastfeeding (BF) influence the risk of 
rheumatoid arthritis (rA), stratifying the cases by 
presence/absence of anticitrullinated protein antibodies 
(ACpA), and whether these factors interact with known 
risk factors in the development of ACpA-positive rA.
Methods Women aged ≥18 years, participants in the 
population-based case–control Swedish Epidemiological 
Investigation of rA study (2641 cases/4251 controls), 
completed an extensive questionnaire regarding oC, 
BF and potential confounders. We calculated ors, with 
95% CIs, adjusted for age, residential area, smoking 
and alcohol consumption. Attributable proportion due to 
interaction (Ap) was estimated to evaluate presence of 
interaction.
results Compared with never users, ever and past 
oC users had a decreased risk of ACpA-positive rA 
(or=0.84 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.96); or=0.83 (95% CI 
0.73 to 0.95), respectively). no significant associations 
were found for ACpA-negative rA. Long duration of 
oC use (>7 years vs never use) decreased the risk of 
both ACpA-positive (p=0.0037) and ACpA-negative 
rA (p=0.0356). A history of long BF decreased the 
risk only of ACpA-positive rA in a dose-dependent 
manner (p=0.0086), but this trend did not remain after 
adjustments. A significant interaction was observed 
between the lack of oC use and smoking (Ap=0.28 
(95% CI 0.14–0.42)) on the risk of ACpA-positive rA. no 
interactions were found for BF.
Conclusions oC decreased the risk of rA, especially 
ACpA-positive rA, where an interaction with smoking 
was observed. A long duration of oC use decreased the 
risk of both disease subsets. We could not confirm an 
association between BF and a decreased risk of either 
ACpA-positive or ACpA-negative rA.
IntrOduCtIOn
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is among the most 
common autoimmune diseases, with a complex 
interplay of genetic and environmental factors 
involved in its aetiology.1 2 Since the disease is two 
to three times more common among women as 
compared with men,3–5 it has been suggested that 
hormonal and reproductive factors might partly 
explain this sex difference.
Regarding oral contraceptive (OC) use and the 
risk of RA, some studies have shown an inverse asso-
ciation,6–11 but the majority of reports have been 
unable to demonstrate an association.12–23 Only a 
few previous reports have taken seropositivity into 
account, either exploring the classic rheumatoid 
factor (RF)6 9 11 15 21 or presence/absence of antici-
trullinated protein antibodies (ACPA).12 14 Further-
more, disparate results so far might be explained by 
methodological issues, such as the use of prevalent 
cases for analysis,14 inclusion of non-population 
controls9 11 or relatively few cases.11 12 21
Breastfeeding (BF) has been associated with a 
decreased risk of RA,13 15 24 25 and a long duration 
of BF seems to have the strongest association.15 24 
However, some studies have found an increased RA 
risk.12 26 Analyses taking seropositivity into account 
have yielded disparate results.12 13 15 26 Among 
these, Berglin et al reported that a longer BF history 
provided a higher risk of RA among those carrying 
the PTPN22 1858T variant or were positive for 
ACPA or RF.12 Apart from these studies, the influ-
ence of BF on ACPA-positive/ACPA-negative RA 
has not been further investigated.
For the ACPA-positive subgroup of RA, several 
risk factors have been identified, including smoking, 
the PTPN22*R620W (1858 
C/T) risk allele and the 
HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) allele.1 27–31 In 
contrast, for the ACPA-negative subgroup of RA, 
only a few risk factors have been identified.2 31 
ACPA-status and the classic RF highly correlate, 
and risk factors for seropositive/negative RA behave 
similarly.2 30 32
The aim of this study was to investigate the asso-
ciation between both OC use and total history of BF 
among parous women, and the risk of developing 
RA stratifying the cases by ACPA-status (positive/
negative), using data from a large population-based 
case–control study. Moreover, the aim was to 
explore potential additive interactions between 
BF and OC, respectively, in regard to known risk 
factors for ACPA-positive disease, namely smoking 
status, presence of SE alleles and PTPN22 gene.

study design
This study was based on data from the Swedish 
Epidemiological 
Investigation 
of 
RA 
(EIRA) 
comprising women above 18 years, living in 
defined geographical areas of Sweden, between 
1996 and 2014. The general design of the EIRA 
study has been described in detail elsewhere.33 Inci-
dent cases of RA were diagnosed by rheumatologists 
and included if they fulfilled either the American 
College of Rheumatology 1987 criteria34 or the

latest 2010 RA criteria.35 T
wenty-four cases were diagnosed 
according to the new criteria alone. Controls were randomly 
selected from the national population register and matched to 
the cases by age (5-year group) and residential area. For further 
details, see online supplementary text (online supplementary 
file 1). All participants provided written informed consent, and 
ethical approval was obtained from the Regional Ethical Review 
Board at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.
data collection
Participants completed an extensive questionnaire regarding life-
style and environmental exposures, including OC use, BF and 
potential confounders. Information about OC use was available 
for the entire study period, whereas information on BF history 
among parous women was only available from 2006.
Between 1996 and 2014, a total of 2809 cases and 5312 
controls were identified; of these, 2676 cases (95%) and 4251 
controls (80%) answered the questionnaire. Blood samples were 
available from all participating cases.
Antibody assays and genotyping
Blood samples were assayed for ACPA-status using the Immu-
noscan-RA Mark2 ELISA test (Euro-Diagnostica, Malmö, 
Sweden).36 37 The cut-off value for ACPA-positive RA was 25 
U/
mL. A total of 35 and 13 cases lacking information on ACPA-
status were excluded from the OC and BF analyses, respectively.
Genotyping of the PTPN22 and HLA-DRB1 genes was 
conducted as previously described.38 39 Among HLA-DRB1 
genes, DRB1*01, DRB1*04 and DRB1*10 genes were defined 
as SE alleles. Any genotype containing 1 or 2 of these genes was 
considered as having ‘any SE allele’, versus those not having any 
of the genes (‘no SE alleles’).
exposures
The year in which the first symptoms of RA occurred was defined 
as the index-year for each case. Controls were then assigned the 
same index-year as their matched case.
Current users of OCs were defined as those who were 
currently using OCs during the index-year and who had started 
at least the year before index-year. Participants who started OC 
use during index-year (four cases/seven controls) and those with 
missing information on OC use (59 cases/115 controls) were 
excluded from the analyses. Past users were defined as those who 
used OCs in the past and had stopped at least the year before 
the index-year. Ever users were defined as current and past users 
while never users were women who had not used OCs at any 
time before the index-year.
Parous women were defined as those who had given birth 
before or during the index-year. Total BF history among parous 
women was calculated as the sum of the duration of BF for 
each child born and categorised as 0–6, 7–12 and ≥13 months, 
according to quartile distribution among controls. Partici-
pants with missing information on BF history (78 cases/148 
controls) were excluded from analyses. Parous women who did 
not breast feed (two cases/14 controls) were included in the 
reference category.
statistical analysis
Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of RA 
overall, ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative RA, associated 
with OC use and BF were calculated by means of uncondi-
tional logistic regression. Regarding OC use, current/past/ever 
users were compared with never users. Duration of OC use 
was categorised according to the median value among controls 
(≤7/>7 years). For the BF analyses, the shortest duration of BF 
(0–6 months) was used as the reference category.
All analyses were adjusted for the matching variables (age and 
residential area). We conducted additional adjustments (each 
variable was investigated separately) for parity (yes/no), number 
of children (1, 2, 3 and ≥4), body mass index (<25/≥25 
kg/
m2), menopausal status, use of postmenopausal hormone 
therapy (ever/never), age at menarche (≤11, 12, 13 and ≥14 
years), age at first birth (<22, 22–24, 25–29 and >29 years), 
time between last delivered child and the index-year (0–24, 
25–30, 31–37 and >37 years), index-year intervals, university 
education (yes/no), pack-years of cigarette smoking (0–<10, 
≥10–<20 
and ≥20) and alcohol consumption (low (including 
non-drinkers), medium and high). We also adjusted for OC use 
when analysing BF as the main exposure and vice versa. Only 
smoking and alcohol consumption made a change in the ORs 
and were retained in the final analyses.
Potential interaction was estimated using departure from addi-
tivity of effects (additive interaction), as suggested by Rothman.40 
We tested for interactions in the same manner for both OC use 
and BF with well-established risk factors of RA: smoking, SE 
alleles and PTPN22 risk allele.
To evaluate interaction, the attributable proportion due to 
interaction (AP) was calculated together with the 95% 
CI.41 The 
AP is the proportion of the incidence among people exposed to 
two interacting factors, indicating their joint effect apart from 
the sum of their independent effects. For further details, see 
online supplementary text.
All analyses were carried out using the Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS) V
.9.4.
results
In total, 2641 cases and 4251 controls were available for the 
OC analyses. Overall, 1756 (66.5%) cases were ACPA-positive 
and the mean time between symptom onset and diagnosis was 
10 months for both ACPA subsets. A total of 2578 cases and 
4129 controls were included in the OC analyses after all exclu-
sions. For BF, a total of 1242 cases and 2658 controls were 
available for analysis (for the period 2006–2014), of which 884 
cases and 1949 controls where parous women with available 
BF history. Baseline characteristics of participants are presented 
in table 1.
OC use and risk of rA
Ever users of OCs had a decreased odds of developing RA 
overall compared with never users (OR=0.87, 95% 
CI 0.78 to 
0.97). The OR for current and past users were 0.85 (95% CI 
0.68 to 1.06) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.98), respectively. The 
association between ever and past OC use was significant for 
ACPA-positive, but not for the smaller subset of ACPA-negative 
RA, and remained significant after adjustment for pack-years of 
smoking and alcohol consumption (table 2).
A longer duration of ever OC use (above the median value 
of 7 years) was associated with a decreased risk of RA overall 
(OR=0.81, 95% 
CI 0.71 to 0.92). The trend with a longer dura-
tion was significant for both ACPA-positive (p=0.0037) and 
ACPA-negative RA (p=0.0356). Similar result was observed for 
past OC use except for ACPA-negative RA, probably due to lack 
of power (table 3). Separate analyses for OC using RF yielded 
similar results (data not shown).

Compared with women who breast fed for 0–6 months, those 
who breast fed their children for 7–12 months had an OR of 
0.93 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.14) of developing RA overall, whereas 
BF for 13 months or more had an OR of 0.77 (95% CI 0.63 
to 0.94). This declining trend was statistically significant for

ACPA-positive, but not for ACPA-negative RA. These estimates 
were attenuated after adjustment for smoking and alcohol 
consumption (table 4). Analyses using RF instead of ACPA gave 
similar results (data not shown).
Interaction analyses
Never OC use among never smokers was not associated with 
risk of ACPA-positive RA (OR=0.99, 95% 
CI 0.81 to 1.21). 
Compared with never smoking women which had used OCs, 
women who had smoked and used OCs had an OR=1.71 (95% 
CI 1.47 to 1.99), whereas women who had smoked and never 
used OCs had an OR=2.34 (95% CI 1.95 to 2.82) (table 5). 
Moreover, a significant interaction on the additive scale was 
found between smoking and never use of OCs (AP=0.28, 
95% 
CI 0.14 to 0.42) regarding the risk of ACPA-positive RA, 
indicating that among smokers the risk was more pronounced 
in never OC users than in ever OC users. No significant inter-
actions were found between OC use and SE alleles, the PTPN22 
gene or between BF and any of the three factors explored (data 
not shown).
dIsCussIOn
In this large population-based case–control study of incident RA, 
with careful matching between cases and controls and extensive 
exposure information, we found that women who had ever used 
OCs had a significantly decreased risk of developing RA. The 
estimates were similar for current and past use, although only 
significant in the larger group of past users. When stratifying by 
ACPA-status, the association was only significant for ACPA-pos-
itive RA in both crude and adjusted models. A significant

Clinical and epidemiological research
dose–response association was observed for duration of ever OC 
use both for ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative RA. Non-use of 
OC significantly interacted with smoking regarding the risk of 
ACPA-positive RA. Furthermore, BF also decreased the risk of 
RA in a dose-dependent manner (total duration), but this trend 
was only significant for ACPA-positive RA and did not maintain 
after adjustments.
EIRA has the advantage of being one of the largest popula-
tion-based case–control studies comprising incident cases of 
RA with concordant information on environmental and genetic 
factors. The selection of controls (randomly and continuously 
from the same study base as the cases) minimises the possible 
selection bias in this step. Another major strength of our study 
was the possibility to adjust our results with respect to several 
potential confounders.
Several limitations of our study should be mentioned. First, 
although the participation proportion among controls was high 
(80%), selection bias may have occurred if the controls did not

Clinical and epidemiological research
reflect the exposure frequency in the study base. However, both 
BF and ever OC use among controls were very similar to the 
high frequency of BF42 and reported OC use43 among Swedish 
women, respectively. Second, we did not have detailed infor-
mation regarding OC preparations or doses, being only able to 
conduct analyses on OC use as a whole.
Regarding OC use, our finding of a decreased risk of devel-
oping RA is in accordance with previous reports.6–11 Although 
most previous studies have not observed a statistically significant 
association,12–21 some results have suggested a protective effect, 
but the sample size might have been inadequate to reach definite 
conclusions. Only borderline associations have been observed 
in a few recent meta-analyses.22 23 Our results are in agreement 
with those from Doran et al,6 who reported a decreased risk 
among ever (OR=0.57 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.91) but not among 
current (OR=1.0 (95% CI 0.4 to 2.52) OC users. Another 
case–control study performed in Sweden showed a non-signif-
icant association for ever (OR=0.70, 95% 
CI 0.40 to 1.24) and 
current (OR=1.21, 95% 
CI 0.58 to 2.52) OC users, but the asso-
ciation for past users was significant (OR=0.37, 95% 
CI 0.16 
to 0.86).8 These findings are in line with our results, although 
they used old criteria (year 1958) for RA diagnosis. In line with 
our findings, Berglin et al found a protective effect with OC use 
 
>7 years.12
Previous reports taking seropositivity into account have 
yielded contradictory results.6 9 11 12 14 15 21 Doran et al found 
a protective effect of OC exposure on the risk of RF-positive 
(OR=0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.72) but not RF-negative RA 
(OR=0.982, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.10).6 By contrast, Pedersen 
 
et al reported an increased risk of ACPA-positive RA among 
ever users of OC (OR=1.65, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.57).14 However, 
the inclusion of prevalent cases (diagnosed within 5 years) 
might entail bias. Our result was notably mainly restricted to 
ACPA-positive RA and estimates only slightly modified after 
adjustments. Similar results using RF instead of ACPA-status 
corroborate the high correlation between ACPA-status and the 
classic RF.
The current knowledge on the association between BF and 
RA has not reached firm conclusions. In a large cohort study, 
Karlson et al found a decreased risk of RA among women who 
breast fed for more than 12 months, with a significant trend with 
increased duration of BF.15 Restricting the analyses to RF posi-
tive patients, a similar reduction was found for a total BF dura-
tion of ≥24 months. In line with these results, a study conducted 
in Sweden showed a decreased risk of RA among women who 
breast fed their children for more than a year, with similar trends 
for RF-negative/RF-positive RA.13 A similar result was obtained 
by a recent cross-sectional study in an Asian population.24 Our 
estimates were attenuated after adjustments for smoking and 
alcohol consumption, which indicates their role as important 
confounders in this study. Analyses using RF yielded similar 
results as those for ACPA-status. However, in a nested case–
control study, Berglin et al found a strong association between 
BF and later development of RA (OR=4.8, 95% 
CI 1.43 to 
15.8) with a higher risk with increasing time of BF and greater 
among ACPA-positive cases.12 Similar findings were reported 
by Brennan and Silman, with a higher risk for RF-positive RA 
among women who breast fed.26 These opposite results might be 
explained by methodological issues (small number of cases (70) 
and recruitment via a media campaign, respectively). Finally, a 
recently published systematic review and meta-analysis reported 
a decreased risk of RA, whether with a longer or shorter dura-
tion of BF.25 Our study confirms and extends these findings by 
adding the stratification according to ACPA-status, which to our 
knowledge has not been explored using a large dataset as in our 
present study.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has found 
evidence of interaction between OC and/or BF and smoking 
habits or major genetic risk factors of RA, respectively. The 
significant interaction between lack of OC use and smoking indi-
cates that the risk of ACPA-positive RA associated with smoking 
is higher among women who never used OCs than among those 
who did. However, since both smoking and the use of OC have 
been linked to an increased predisposition to venous thrombotic 
events (VTE), women with a history of VTEs (especially if they 
smoke) might be recommended not to use OC by their physi-
cian. We can therefore not exclude the possibility that our find-
ings on an interaction between non-OC use and smoking merely 
reflects that smoking women, who have an increased RA risk, do 
not receive OC prescription as often. The physiopathology of 
RA is complex and not fully understood, but our findings may 
contribute to the knowledge regarding mechanisms of impor-
tance for the development of RA.
The postpartum period soon after delivery has been described 
as a time of higher risk for the onset of RA.19 The immuno-
stimulating effect of the hormone prolactin, levels of which are 
elevated during BF, might explain this increased risk immedi-
ately after childbirth.44 However, recent findings indicate that 
prolactin might act more as a regulator of inflammation, with 
protective and regenerative functions.45 Since elevated prolactin 
levels do not support our findings, a potential biological mech-
anism might be a prolonged anti-inflammatory effect of proges-
terone. It has been shown that elevated progesterone levels 
during pregnancy remain high during BF through expression of 
progesterone receptors in lymphocytes.46 Finally, another poten-
tial mechanism might be an anti-inflammatory effect of cortisol, 
which has been found to be significantly higher among post-
menopausal women with a history of BF.47
The potential effect of hormones contained in OC prepa-
rations might vary according to dose and type. Although such 
information was not available in the present study, the protec-
tive effect seems to differ between ACPA-subsets and with a 
longer duration of OC use, supporting the hypothesis of a dose–
response effect.
The protective effect of OC use on the risk of ACPA-posi-
tive RA is in line with our previous finding of a reduced risk 
of ACPA-positive RA, among women who used postmenopausal 
hormone therapy.48 On the other hand, the finding of a protec-
tive effect of BF on the risk of ACPA-positive (in the crude 
model), but not ACPA-negative RA, is in line with our previous 
finding of a risk of ACPA-negative but not ACPA-positive RA 
during the postpartum period.49 All of these findings together 
support the notion of RA as two different disease entities with 
different risk factors patterns.
In summary, we found an inverse relationship between OC use 
and the subsequent development of RA, especially ACPA-posi-
tive RA. An interaction between never OC use and smoking was 
also observed for this subgroup of disease, implying that among 
smokers, the risk was more pronounced in never OC users than 
in ever OC users. A trend was observed for longer duration of BF 
and decreased risk of ACPA-positive RA, although not significant 
after adjustments. In this large population-based study, we were 
able to address these questions more thoroughly than has been 
possible before, by examining disease subsets separately, in the 
context of other risk factors and by considering many potential 
confounders. Further research is required to explore the biolog-
ical mechanisms behind our findings and whether hormonal 
factors have different impact on the ACPA-subsets of RA.
