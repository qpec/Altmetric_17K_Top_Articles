Childhood adversity negatively impacts the biological development of children and has been
linked to poor health outcomes across the life course. The purpose of this literature review is to
explore and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions that have addressed an array of biological
markers and physical health outcomes in children and adolescents affected by adversity.
PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Sociological Abstracts databases and additional sources (Cochrane,
WHO, NIH trial registries) were searched for English language studies published between
January 2007 and September 2017. Articles with a childhood adversity exposure, biological
health outcome, and evaluation of intervention using a randomized controlled trial study design
were selected. The resulting 40 intervention studies addressed cortisol outcomes (n = 20) and a
range of neurological, epigenetic, immune, and other outcomes (n = 22). Across institutional,
foster care, and community settings, intervention programs demonstrated success overall for
improving or normalizing morning and diurnal cortisol levels, and ameliorating the impacts of
adversity on brain development, epigenetic regulation, and additional outcomes in children.
Factors such as earlier timing of intervention, high quality and nurturant parenting traits, and
greater intervention engagement played a role in intervention success. This study underlines
progress and promise in addressing the health impacts of adversity in children. Ongoing research
efforts should collect baseline data, improve retention, replicate studies in additional samples and
settings, and evaluate additional variables, resilience factors, mediators, and long-term im-
plications of results. Clinicians should integrate lessons from the intervention sciences for pre-
venting and treating the health effects of adversity in children and adolescents.
1. Childhood adversity
Childhood adversities such as abuse, neglect, and additional household stressors, are highly prevalent, and are linked to poor
child and adult health, and high societal costs (Bright, Alford, Hinojosa, Knapp, & Fernandez-Baca, 2015; Fang, Brown, Florence, &
Mercy, 2012; Felitti et al., 1998; Flaherty et al., 2013; Wing, Gjelsvik, Nocera, & McQuaid, 2015). As many as 60% of children and
adolescents in national population-based studies have experienced at least one category of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE)

T
 (Bethell, Newacheck, Hawes, & Halfon, 2014). Data on ACE exposures among youth in foster care, and community settings reveal
that these populations demonstrate particularly high prevalence of early adversity. Foster care children are at between 1.5 and 7
times greater odds of having experienced any one of the 10 traditional ACEs compared to children not placed in foster care, even after
controlling for race/ethnicity, parent education and employment, welfare services, and poverty status (Turney & Wildeman, 2017).
Additionally, in an urban community sample, 92% of youth endorsed at least one stressor, including ACEs and additional community-
specific adversities (Purewal Boparai et al., 2017).
Longitudinal research has demonstrated that children exposed to adversity are at risk for detrimental behavioral and mental
health outcomes in youth and adulthood (Fergusson, McLeod, & Horwood, 2013; Flaherty et al., 2013; Lansford et al., 2002;
Maniglio, 2009; Turner, Finkelhor, & Ormrod, 2006). An emerging body of data is beginning to shed light about the risk of physical
health outcomes. A recent systematic review evaluating longitudinal child health outcomes associated with childhood adversity
found that child outcomes, such as asthma, were consistently and negatively impacted by child adversity (Oh et al., 2018). A richer
understanding of chronic and physical health outcomes stems from the literature on adult retrospective self-reports; researchers have
found a dose-response relationship between the number of ACEs and many leading causes of death in the United States, including
heart disease and cancer, as well as premature mortality (Brown et al., 2009; Felitti et al., 1998; Kalmakis & Chandler, 2015).
2. Toxic stress
The cumulative body of evidence on early life stress has generated the concept of toxic stress, which is the chronic or frequent
activation of the stress response that results from exposure to severe or frequent adversity in childhood in the absence of support from
a caregiver (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2005). The human stress response is determined by a complex
interplay between central and autonomic divisions of the nervous system, and interactions with endocrine, immune, and genetic
regulatory mechanisms. The nervous system plays a major role in activating and regulating the stress response through the hy-
pothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axes.
The activation of these two axes has been also described as “fight or flight” response and exerts its action through a cascade of
responses that involves the secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine, and glucocorticosteroids, such as cortisol and dehy-
droepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) (Bucci, Marques, Oh, & Harris, 2016). The HPA axis upregulates and downregulates the cascade
of biological events that prepare the body to respond to a stressor; cortisol, the end product of the HPA axis, has been extensively
studied in the field of early life stress (Gunnar & Donzella, 2002). Humans have a typical diurnal cortisol pattern that spikes 30 min
after waking and slopes toward nadir in the evening; infants do not show an established pattern until about three months of age and
approach a more predictable pattern over the first two years of life (Gunnar & Donzella, 2002; Larson, White, Cochran, Donzella, &
Gunnar, 1998; Sippell, Becker, Versmold, Bidlingmaier, & Knorr, 1978). When young children are exposed to significant or frequent
adversity, cortisol levels can either become hyper- or hypoactive due to a dysregulated feedback loop (Bernard, Butzin-Dozier,
Rittenhouse, & Dozier, 2010; Bruce, Fisher, Pears, & Levine, 2009; Gunnar & Vazquez, 2001).
The dysregulation of the stress response can result in a persistent elevation of circulating immune markers such as C-reactive
protein (CRP) and proinflammatory cytokines (Bucci et al., 2016). Childhood adversities such as maltreatment, social isolation, and
economic disadvantage have been linked to high levels of inflammation in adulthood (Danese et al., 2009). Moreover, altered levels
of inflammatory markers and cortisol have been documented to impact brain structure and function (Bucci et al., 2016). Additionally,
numerous studies have shown the impacts of early life stress on the developing brain (Carrion, Weems, & Reiss, 2007; Choi, Jeong,
Rohan, Polcari, & Teicher, 2009; Glaser, 2000). Finally, epigenetic changes due to exposure to early adversity have also been
identified (Bucci et al., 2016; Drury, Theall, et al., 2012; Shalev et al., 2013). Physiological dysregulation can alter brain architecture
and other organ systems during sensitive periods of childhood development when children are most vulnerable to social and en-
vironmental context; the negative health outcomes that follow later in adult life may be a result of cumulative physiological, epi-
genetic, and cognitive responses to chronic stress due to early exposure to adversity (Bucci et al., 2016).
3. Clinical advocacy and action
Given the evidence of effects of adversity on children’s health, it is critical to develop best practices to reverse the biologically
damaging impacts of early life stress. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has called on scientists and practitioners to explore
solutions to address early adversity and associated outcomes, including novel and effective preventative treatments (Garner,
Shonkoff, Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health, Committee on Early Childhood, Adoption, and Dependent
Care, & and Section on Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 2012; Johnson, Riley, Granger, & Riis, 2013; Shonkoff, Garner, &
Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health, Committee on Early Childhood, Adoption, and Dependent Care, &
Section on Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 2012). Understanding progress on intervention research is essential to iden-
tifying effective intervention components and outcome targets, highlighting study limitations, and improving research with the
ultimate goal of informing translation and development of standard practices of care for children and adolescents exposed to ad-
versity.
To date, a number of interventions have successfully targeted cortisol outcomes in an effort to regulate maltreated children’s
physiological response to stress (Fisher, Gunnar, Dozier, Bruce, & Pears, 2006; Gunnar, Fisher, Early Experience, Stress, & and
Prevention Network, 2006). Slopen, McLaughlin, and Shonkoff (2014) reviewed 19 interventions that addressed regulation of cortisol
secretion among children. Interventions drew from both healthy and negatively-impacted samples and focused exclusively on cortisol
outcomes. Researchers found that cortisol levels can be modified through interventions yet variation across studies in cortisol

83
 sampling and measurement methods, study design, and study sample made it difficult to draw clear conclusions (Slopen et al., 2014).
A second review, compiled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, focused on interventions addressing self-regulation
in children; studies evaluating cortisol outcomes, as well as many behavioral and mental health outcomes were reviewed (Murray,
Rosanbalm, & Christopoulos, 2016). These resources provide a foundational basis for understanding the biological embedding of
adversity, as well as efforts to remedy cortisol dysregulation. However, research continues to support the notion that child adversity
has broader biological and health consequences, therefore it is essential to understand the state of the intervention sciences with
respect to a more comprehensive recognition of the systemic consequences of early life stress.
4. Study objectives
The aim of this scoping review is to expand the body of knowledge by describing interventions that have targeted a wider
selection of biological health outcomes, with a focus on interventions developed exclusively for children exposed to adversity, given
that their response to treatment can vary from non-maltreated samples (Frohlich, Pott, Albayrak, Hebebrand, & Pauli-Pott, 2011;
Heins, Knoop, Lobbestael, & Bleijenberg, 2011; Slesnick, Kang, & Aukward, 2008; Zobel et al., 2011), as well as through the gold
standard of evaluation research, the randomized controlled trial (RCT). We conclude with evidence-based recommendations and
implications for practice and research to influence best practices for addressing toxic stress in children and adolescents.
5. Method
A comprehensive scoping literature review was conducted to identify intervention articles that addressed biological health
outcomes in children and adolescents exposed to childhood adversities. To present timely and relevant data, the timeframe of
2007–2017 was selected for exploration. Furthermore, to inform generalizability of intervention programs, studies on animal models
as well as case studies were excluded. Primary sources of data included cross-disciplinary medical, health, psychology and sociology-
based databases including PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Sociological Abstracts. Additionally, clinical trials registries from the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and World Health Organization (WHO) were searched. Additionally, both Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) were hand searched for relevant
articles. Finally, reference lists from selected articles, and relevant literature reviews were evaluated for additional relevant articles.
Fig. 1 depicts the literature search process.
Articles were selected for inclusion on the basis of three criteria: (1) adversity exposure during childhood (age 0–18 years), (2)
intervention provided during childhood (age 0–18 years), (3) biological health outcome measurement and (4) evaluation through an
RCT study design. Terminology for childhood adversity exposures was drawn from various adversity literature sources including the
ACE study which explores abuse, neglect and household dysfunction, as well as additional adversity screening tools, such as the
Center for Youth Wellness ACE Questionnaire (Burke Harris & Renschler, 2015; Felitti et al., 1998). Biological outcomes were
selected from the ACE study which evaluated chronic health conditions in adults, as well as studies of biomarkers and health
outcomes in adversity-exposed children, which have assessed biomarkers such as telomere length and cortisol, and health outcomes
such as asthma, obesity and sleep disorders. Additionally, literature on human physiology of the stress response and system-wide
biological implications of chronic stress were also evaluated for relevant keywords. Finally, while key words for study design included
“treatment” “program” and “therapy”, only studies that utilized an RCT approach were selected for data extraction and analysis.
6. Results
6.1. Study characteristics
The search strategy resulted in 40 research articles that were published within the 2007 and 2017 timeframe. Almost half
(n = 19) of articles were published within the last three years (2015–2017). Additionally, most studies (n = 29) evaluated outcomes
in youth who were participating in one of four specific intervention programs: Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up (ABC; n = 5),
Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP; n = 12), Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers (MTFC-P; n = 5) and
Strong African American Families (SAAF; n = 7). This review describes the impact of 15 unique intervention programs on biological
health outcomes of adversity-exposed children and adolescents. The impact of interventions are described by sample type: in-
stitutionalized children, foster care children, and children in community settings, due to contextual differences. Tables 1–3 describe
intervention articles in greater detail based on sample type.
Study sample size for child participants ranged from 34 to 461. Eighteen studies evaluated outcomes in 100 or fewer participants,
15 studies evaluated 101–200 participants, and 7 studies evaluated between 200–461 youth; these larger studies mostly drew from
the SAAF program. Adversity-exposed youth were randomized to an intervention group or a comparison. Comparison groups con-
sisted of: care as usual (n = 19 studies) which included regular foster care services or remaining in institutional care, an alternate
intervention (n = 9) often omitting key components or themes of the main intervention, a literature control (n = 9) where families
received reading material, waitlist control (n = 1) in which participants received the full intervention after the waiting period, and
finally, no intervention (n = 2). In 16 studies, researchers enlisted a community comparison or typically developing group that was
not exposed to adversity; ABC, BEIP, MTFC-P, and CPP/IPP (Child-Parent Psychotherapy and Psychoeducational Parenting
Intervention) interventions commonly utilized a non-exposed community comparison. Follow-up time ranged from immediately post-
intervention to 15 years post-intervention and varied greatly. Nine studies evaluated outcomes in one year or less, twelve studies

84
 evaluated outcomes from 2 to 6 years, and eight studies evaluated outcomes between 8–10 years, and between 12–15 years, re-
spectively. Longer time to follow up typically took place in the BEIP and SAAF programs. Despite lengthy time to follow up, most
studies (n = 24) did not collect baseline biological health data.
Several studies (n = 13) evaluated biological health outcomes in children who were either in the foster care system or had
involvement with Child Protective Services (CPS); these programs included ABC and MTFC-P among other programs. Community-
based interventions, including one taking place at a community mental health clinic, were also evaluated in fourteen studies. Finally,
thirteen studies evaluated outcomes in children with a history of institutional care, most of whom participated in BEIP. Most (n = 26)
studies took place in the United States, notably in Atlantic, Pacific Northwest, and rural South regions. Remaining studies took place
in Romania (n = 12), Canada (n = 1), and the Netherlands (n = 1).
6.2. Sample characteristics
Infants and toddlers (age 0–3 years) were the focus of most studies (n = 21). Seven studies evaluated outcomes in children who
received intervention during preschool age (age 4–6 years). Finally, older youth, including preadolescents and adolescents received
one of six intervention programs and their outcomes were evaluated through 12 studies. Overall, proportion of male versus female
participants were equal with the exception of one study that enrolled exclusively adolescent females (Brownlow et al., 2016). Fur-
thermore, studies in the United States enrolled diverse participants. Fifteen studies enrolled majority African American youth in-
cluding SAAF and AIM (Adults in the Making) which enrolled exclusively African American youth. Cognitively-based home visiting
and CPP/PPI enrolled majority Latino and high proportion of minority youth respectively. Lastly, eight studies enrolled majority
White youth. Data on education and socioeconomic status were not consistently reported, however most articles studied participants
from low-income or impoverished backgrounds.
Youth experienced an array of adversities and their experiences are categorized through the setting in which their outcomes were

 evaluated. Children with a history of institutional care were raised in orphanages which can be characterized by subpar quality of
care and resources due to inadequate caregiver ratio and scarce opportunities for children to practice motor and linguistic skills
(Sheridan, Fox, Zeanah, McLaughlin, & Nelson, 2012). Among youth with CPS or foster care involvement, when reasons for in-
volvement were reported, parental neglect was generally the leading reason for a child’s engagement with the child welfare system
(Bernard, Hostinar, & Dozier, 2015; Graham, Pears, Kim, Bruce, & Fisher, 2017; Pace et al., 2013). Other adversities included physical
abuse, emotional abuse, domestic violence, parental substance abuse, homelessness, and parental maltreatment of a sibling. Finally,
studies taking place in community settings engaged youth who had experienced differing life stressors such as poverty, sexual assault,
maternal depression, parental death, parental divorce, criminally-involved sibling, and birth complication with risky living situation.
Some intervention programs were developed to target the particular childhood adversity, such as the Family Bereavement Program
(FBP) serving youth with a recently deceased parent.
6.3. Intervention characteristics
The 15 intervention programs served caregivers and children for a minimum of six weeks through 4.5 years at most. Seven
programs lasted between six and 12 weeks, followed by seven weeks through one year for six intervention programs. Cognitively-
based home visiting provided services for up to three years, and BEIP was available for foster care parents through 54 months at
which point program implementation was transferred to local government agencies. Numerous programs (n = 6) implemented se-
parate parent and child groups where parents and youth received unique skill building opportunities. In most of these programs,
parents and youth additionally participated in joint sessions together. Some programs focused on providing training or support to the
parent of infants. Few programs (n = 2) focused on providing intervention exclusively to youth, including Prolonged Exposure
Therapy (PE) and Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT); these both enrolled adolescents. While most programs were either
dyadic or group-based in nature, some were comprehensive such as MTFC-P and BEIP which provided various services to parents and
children. Home visiting was also utilized, by five programs and partially or as needed by two. Programs were facilitated by various
health professionals including health educators, parent trainers, social workers, and therapists.
Intervention content, especially for parents, focused on improving parenting skills, including being responsive and nurturing,
addressing child needs, protecting children from negative experiences, problem solving, and mentoring children. Attachment was
specifically targeted by some programs (i.e., ABC, CPP/IPP). Some programs aimed to provide greater support for the parent in-
cluding home visiting programs and MTFC-P. For youth participants, programs focused on providing support to develop goals and
plans for the future, coping with stress, self-efficacy and self-esteem or more specifically, practicing meditation with a focus on
compassion and empathy with respect to CBCT. Intervention programs were often structured and manualized. Some had specific
themes or topics per session or week, such as ABC. In some programs (i.e., Promoting First Relationships), videos were made use of to
provide feedback about parent-child interactions. Role-play, and practicing of skills were also integrated into many programs to
deepen understanding of intervention content (i.e., AIM, SAAF, CBCT). Intervention program details are further described in the
Supplemental Material (Table 1).
6.4. Biological health outcomes
Nineteen studies evaluated outcomes related to HPA axis functioning. A slightly greater number of studies (n = 22) evaluated
additional or other types of outcomes including neurologic, epigenetic, and immune outcomes. A description biological markers,
including their function and clinical implications, can be found in the Supplemental Material (Table 2).
The most common HPA axis outcome evaluated was salivary cortisol with 18 studies evaluating cortisol as an exclusive outcome.
Cortisol activity was assessed through morning and evening cortisol levels, diurnal cortisol pattern, and in response to a stressor.
Morning levels were specific to immediately upon awakening, within 30 min of waking, or mid-morning (around 10 am). Evening
levels were collected at bedtime or 30 min prior. Researcher-induced stressors consisted of standard or modified versions of the Trier
Social Stress Test (TSST) and Strange Situation, a peer evaluation task, frustration task, a parent-youth discussion, and entry into
unfamiliar peer group. These activities took place between morning and evening and cortisol samples were collected between 2 and 6
times to capture the full range of HPA axis’ activation and return to baseline. Additionally, researchers evaluated cortisol patterns
after “naturally” occurring stressors including placement change among foster care youth and the start of school. One study measured
DHEA-S, another hormone secreted by the HPA axis, in response to the TSST, peer evaluation and frustration tasks (McLaughlin et al.,
2015)
Central nervous system (CNS) markers (n = 8 studies) consisted of structural and functional markers. These included total white
matter integrity and volume, total gray matter volume as well as specific volumes of the corpus callosum, amygdala and hippo-
campus. Frontal Electroencephalography (EEG) Asymmetry (FEA), parietal EEG Asymmetry (PEA), alpha, beta and theta power were
also assessed to evaluate brain functionality. Biomarkers of the autonomic nervous system (n = 2 studies) consist of heart rate (HR),
diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP, SBP), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), pre-ejection period (PEP), as well as epinephrine
and norepinephrine which play a role in stress response through the SAM axis. Epigenetic outcomes (n = 7 studies) were assessed
through telomere length, telomere shortening, epigenetic aging (based on DNA methylation) and methylation of specific genetic
markers. Immune system outcomes (n = 2 studies) included C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and additional inflammatory cytokines: in-
terleukin (IL) -1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interferon gamma (INF-γ). Other outcomes included
physical growth (height and weight for age, weight for height, occipital frontal circumference), prediabetes, and sleep disturbances.

 6.5. Impacts of interventions on biological health outcomes
6.5.1. Institutionalized children
Children raised in institutional care were randomized to Bucharest Early Intervention Project (n = 12 studies) or Attachment and
Biobehavioral Catch-Up (n = 1). More than half of these studies (n = 7) assessed CNS outcomes, followed by epigenetic (n = 3), HPA
axis (n = 2), and other outcomes (n = 2), such as ANS markers and physical growth. See Table 1 for study design and findings of
RCTs conducted on institutionalized children.

Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP) randomized children (M = 21 months, SD = 7.4) to foster care, FCG (n = 68) or CAUG (n = 68) in Bucharest
Romania. A never institutionalized group (NIG, n = 72) was recruited as a community comparison.

Age, birthweight, intracranial volume controlled for. For two-thirds of
white matter tract measures, FCG and NIG did not significantly differ; a
significant intervention effect favoring FCG over CAUG was seen for: FA
values in right, left external capsule, retrolenticular internal capsule;
MD values for retrolenticular internal capsule, right cingulum, medial
lemniscus; RD values in retrolenticular internal capsule, right
cingulum; AD values in right anterior, left superior corona radiata,
medial lemniscus, (β (SE) −29.41 (15.7)–17.64(10.05),

Birth weight was controlled for. Group-based effects on depression and
anxiety were qualified by gender F(2,107) = 11.84, p < 0.001, F (2,
107) = 6.60, p = 0.002 such that FCG girls had lower scores than
CAUG girls. Group-based differences were seen for white matter
integrity on select tracts, however FCG and CAUG were similar whereas
NIG was different: MD values for body of the corpus callosum
(β = −0.276, p = 0.022), right cingulum of the cingulate gyrus
(β = −0.239, p = 0.029), left external capsule (β=-0.261, p = 0.03);
FA values of the body of the corpus callosum (β = 0.308, p = 0.01), left
external capsule (β = 0.269, p = 0.025), right external capsule
(β = 0.264, p = 0.028). Specific tracts were also associated with
depression and anxiety, p = 0.001–0.046. Group status predicted FA
and MD values in the body of the corpus callosum (β = −0.276,
p = 0.022) which predicted change in anxiety (β = 0.352, p = 0.023)
and depression (β = 0.350, p = 0.024) from age 8 to 12. However,
there was no significant intervention effect due to FCG group status.

There were no group by region or hemisphere differences in absolute or
relative EEG power for alpha, beta or theta bands. There was an
intervention effect on EEG coherence by hemisphere (F(1,88) = 4.28,
p < 0.05) with FCG having lower mean EEG coherence in right
hemisphere vs. CAUG (p < 0.05). Age at placement was associated
with relative alpha power (r = −0.39, p < 0.01) and with absolute
alpha power (r = −0.27, p = 0.06) and relative beta power (r = 0.26,
p = 0.07). There were differences for groups by age at placement for:
relative alpha power (F(2,87) = 3.13, p < 0.05), frontal-temporal
alpha coherence (F(2,87) = 3.98, p < 0.05), frontal-central beta
coherence (F(2,87) = 3.66, p < 0.05). Specifically, FCG children
placed before age 24 months had higher power and lower coherence
versus CAUG, p = 0.06, p = 0.05. Early placed (< 18.5 months) FCG
had lower frontal-temporal alpha coherence vs. CAUG (t(26) = 2.94,
p < 0.01). Early placed FCG also had lower frontal-temporal alpha
coherence (t(51) = 2.08, p < 0.05). Early placed FCG had higher
relative alpha power than comparable CAUG children (t(18) = 2.06,
p = 0.05. Early placed FCG had lower alpha power coherence on
frontal-central (t(18)–2.13, p < 0.05), frontal-temporal (t(18) = 2.60,
p < 0.05) and frontal central beta coherence (t(18) = 2.13,
p < 0.05). While age at placement was correlated with cognitive
functioning measures (r = −0.36–0.49, p ≤ 0.01) EEG measures did
not mediate age at placement and cognitive outcomes.

 6.5.1.1. Central nervous system outcomes. BEIP children who were randomized to high quality foster care benefited from improved
neurodevelopmental outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, such as the one of Bick et al. (2015), found that at age 8,
the integrity of several white matter structures was reduced among children who remained in institutional care (Care as Usual Group,
CAUG) as compared to the foster care group (FCG) intervention children, indicating divergence in neural development post-
randomization. For most structures, FCG did not differ as compared to a never institutionalized group (NIG), indicating normalization
of the developmental trajectory of white matter structures (Bick et al., 2015). At age 8 and 12, impaired integrity of specific white
matter tracts was associated with depression and anxiety symptoms. Some altered white matter structures mediated these outcomes,
however there was no effect of intervention status (Bick, Fox, Zeanah, & Nelson, 2017). FCG and CAUG did not differ in total gray
matter, and central or anterior corpus callosum volume, however similarities between FCG and NIG in total white matter volume and
posterior corpus callosum volume indicate normalization for FCG intervention with CAUG experiencing smaller volume in these
areas. Intervention impacts were not seen for hippocampal, amygdala, basal ganglia volumes or alpha power in a mixed MRI/EEG
study, although white matter volume mediated lower alpha power among CAUG children (Sheridan et al., 2012). Intervention youth
also benefited from greater alpha and lower theta frequency bands (associated with better health outcomes) in specific regions versus
CAUG; no differences were seen in beta power band (associated with cognitive function) (Klimesch, 1999; Warner, 2013). Earlier
intervention placement was associated with greater alpha power versus later placement (Marshall, Reeb, Fox, Nelson, & Zeanah,
2008; Vanderwert, Marshall, Nelson, Zeanah, & Fox, 2010). Four years later, relative alpha power was still lower for CAUG versus
FCG and relative theta power remained higher; FCG and NIG were similar in these outcomes indicating prolonged normalization.
Earlier intervention placement and greater foster care stability also improved outcomes for FCG children (Vanderwert, Zeanah, Fox,
& Nelson, 2016). Finally, although FCG status was not associated with frontal or parietal EEG asymmetry (FEA, PEA; associated with
poor mental and behavioral outcomes), placement prior to 24 months resulted in more favorable FEA growth among FCG children.
Unfavorable FEA at 42 months age was associated with greater internalizing symptoms 8 months later (McLaughlin, Fox, Zeanah, &
Nelson, 2011).
6.5.1.2. Epigenetic outcomes. Epigenetic outcomes proved to be favorable overall for intervention children. At the 3-year follow-up,
ABC children demonstrated significantly longer telomeres than alternative intervention (Developmental Education for Families
(DEF)) and community comparison youth (Hoye, 2015). Furthermore, although FCG and CAUG children in BEIP did not differ in rate
of telomere shortening at age 8, more time spent in institutional care among CAUG predicted increased rate of shortening but not for
FCG, likely indicating protective advantage of intervention status (Humphreys et al., 2016). Additionally, BEIP children with
sensitive genotypes of 5-HTTLPR and BDNF genes (indicating greater risk for poor mental/behavioral problems when combined with
stressful life experience) who received specialized foster care demonstrated significantly less indiscriminate social behavior at 54
months versus CAUG children (Drury, Gleason, et al., 2012; Drury, Theall, et al., 2012).
6.5.1.3. HPA axis outcomes. Intervention impacts on HPA axis outcomes were slightly mixed. At age 12, Troller-Renfree et al. (2017)
documented similar cortisol reactivity between FCG and CAUG in BEIP, although among FCG greater reactivity was associated with
bias toward positive stimuli (associated with better mental health); intervention stability was also associated with greater positive

Baseline cortisol levels (not significantly different among the three
groups, p > 0.05) were controlled for. After the peer evaluation task,
NIG (Mean 2.29 (SD = 0.56)) exhibited significantly higher cortisol
response whereas FCG (1.93(0.63)) and CAUG (1.97(0.51)) responded
similarly. For FCG, positive attention bias (showing bias toward
positive stimuli; related with better mental health and coping)
predicted less blunted cortisol reactivity (β = 0.03, t(39) = 1.958,
p = 0.05). For CAUG, neither positive nor threat biases were related to
cortisol reactivity (β = 0.001, t(40) = 0.384, p = 0.701; β = 0.001, t
(40) = 0.873, p = 0.383). Stability in the FCG was related to greater
attention bias toward positive stimuli versus CAUG, (F(2, 78) = 5.386,

 attention bias. In response to a stressful task, FCG experienced less blunting of cortisol secretion than CAUG children and earlier
placement was associated with normalized cortisol response across stressful tasks; there was no intervention effect on DHEA-S
however (McLaughlin et al., 2015).
6.5.1.4. Other outcomes. Several ANS markers were also evaluated in response to stressful tasks; CAUG in the BEIP experienced
blunted response compared to FCG on several markers and tasks and FCG exhibited blunted ANS response on some tasks in compared
to NIG indicating that while intervention was beneficial, the intervention group did not reach normalcy comparable to the unexposed
sample. Intervention placement prior to 18 months improved RSA response however (McLaughlin et al., 2015). Finally, most indices
of physical growth improved among FCG versus CAUG, including achieving normal range for height, weight, and weight for height.
Factors such as earlier randomization and greater caregiver quality (greater sensitivity and attachment) predicted faster height catch-
up (Johnson, 2010).
6.5.2. Children in foster care
Thirteen studies involving infants, toddlers, preschool-age children, and adolescents from the child welfare system largely
evaluated cortisol outcomes. Children were randomized to Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up (ABC), Child-Parent
Psychotherapy and Psychoeducational Parenting Intervention (CPP/PPI), Promoting First Relationships (PFR), Multidimensional
Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers (MTFC-P), Kids in Transition to School (KITS), or Cognitively-Based Compassion Training
(CBCT). Overall, findings were promising in improving or preventing dysregulation of cortisol production, including during stressful
situations such as starting school. Given the age-based development of the HPA axis, findings are synthesized by age group below. See
Table 2 for details from studies on children in child welfare settings.
6.5.2.1. HPA axis outcomes in young children. Among infants whose families received the ABC intervention, awakening and diurnal
cortisol patterns of secretion were higher and steeper respectively versus DEF comparison children; comparably DEF infants exhibited
blunted morning and diurnal patterns. Bedtime cortisol levels did not differ significantly (Bernard, Dozier, Bick, & Gordon, 2015).
These findings persisted from post-intervention to three years later (Bernard, Hostinar, et al., 2015). Similarly, infants participating in
evaluation of CPP/PPI saw favorable cortisol outcomes. Intervention and community comparison infants exhibited similar morning
cortisol levels whereas the control group demonstrated comparable blunting of cortisol secretion (Cicchetti, Rogosch, Toth, & Sturge-
Apple, 2011). Infants part of PFR did not experience differing morning cortisol production versus comparison however (Nelson &
Spieker, 2013). In a modified version of the ABC, for toddlers, intervention and DEF comparison children did not exhibit a difference
in cortisol levels from baseline to two years later (Szenczy, 2016). In response to stressors, cortisol responsivity findings were less
promising. While ABC infants had lower initial daytime cortisol levels (comparable to community comparison), they did not
demonstrate differential response to the Strange Situation versus DEF counterparts (Dozier, Peloso, Lewis, Laurenceau, & Levine,
2008). PFR children did demonstrate a response to the Strange Situation, however a third of infants moved from a flat to increased
cortisol response (Nelson & Spieker, 2013).
Programs targeting cortisol outcomes among preschool age children were successful overall. Participants of MTFC-P exhibited
morning (30 min after awakening) and diurnal cortisol patterns comparable to a community comparison group one year after in-
tervention whereas foster care control children demonstrated greater pattern of blunting overtime (Fisher, Stoolmiller, Gunnar, &
Burraston, 2007). Similar to findings from ABC, evening cortisol outcomes were not significantly different among groups at follow-up
(Fisher et al., 2007). Stable cortisol production for MTFC-P and blunted production for regular foster care control were sustained six
years later and anxiety outcomes were implicated among control children with high and stable cortisol outcomes (Laurent, Gilliam,
Bruce, & Fisher, 2014). A pilot of the MTFC-P program in the Netherlands did not replicate intervention impacts on cortisol outcomes
however (Jonkman et al., 2017). Response to stressors were also evaluated. In response to placement change, foster care youth
receiving MTFC-P did not demonstrate a change in diurnal cortisol slope from 6 months before to 6 months after placement change
(Fisher, Van Ryzin, & Gunnar, 2011). On the other hand, control children’s cortisol patterns became significantly more blunted over
time versus intervention group (Fisher et al., 2011). In response to the start of school, although the pattern of diurnal cortisol was
similar between MTFC-P and control children, patterns varied over time. MTFC-P and community comparison youth had steeper
cortisol slope across the first day of school whereas control youth had steeper slope on the 5 t h day following school versus the week
prior, perhaps indicating a delayed HPA response (Graham et al., 2012). In KITS Program, intervention was similarly associated with
steeper diurnal cortisol pattern on the first day of school; this was predictive of positive school adjustment with cortisol as a mediator.
Completion of a greater number of KITS sessions was also associated with steeper slope across the first day. The control condition
experienced unfavorably higher evening cortisol levels on the first day compared to KITS youth (Graham et al., 2017).
6.5.2.2. HPA axis and immune system outcomes in adolescents. Finally, one study evaluated biological health outcomes among foster
care adolescents. CRP and cortisol samples were collected at awakening before and after the six-week long CBCT program. Compared
to waitlist comparison, teens receiving CBCT did not exhibit different cortisol or CRP levels at post-intervention. However, among
intervention youth with practice time data, a greater number of practice sessions was associated with greater reduction in CRP and
cortisol levels. Controlling for mental health outcomes did not modify CRP levels among CBCT youth (Pace et al., 2012; Pace et al.,
2013).

 6.5.3. Children in community settings
Of the 14 studies evaluated in community settings, half addressed the health of impoverished African American adolescents
enrolled in Strong African American Families (SAAF). The other interventions included Adults in the Making (AIM), Prolonged
Exposure therapy (PE), Family Bereavement Program (FBP), New Beginnings Program (NBP), a family-based intervention, and two
home visiting programs. Older and adolescent youth were the focus of 11 studies in this setting type overall. Adversity exposures and
biological health outcomes varied but largely focused on HPA axis and epigenetic outcomes. Details of studies and findings can be
found in the Table 3.
6.5.3.1. HPA axis outcomes. Cortisol outcomes were assessed in community youth across the age spectrum, and overall, results were
mostly favorable in modifying HPA axis functioning. In response to receiving a family-based intervention, preschool children
demonstrated an increase in cortisol levels immediately before the stressor versus control children and relative to levels while at
home; there was no intervention effect after the stressor (Brotman et al., 2007). Among infants whose mothers received specialized
home visiting services, morning cortisol levels were lower for intervention youth at year 1 and 3 versus control; less avoidant parent
tactics in the intervention group predicted lower cortisol levels; lower cortisol levels in the intervention group at year 1 predicted
greater memory outcomes at age 3 (Bugental, Schwartz, & Lynch, 2010). Finally, Letourneau et al. (2011) saw reduction in daily
cortisol values from baseline to 12 weeks post-randomization, however intervention and waiting groups did not differ significantly in
cortisol levels indicating no intervention effect.
Among adolescent youth who experienced parental death and parental divorce respectively, cortisol responsivity to stressor was
assessed and parenting attributes and younger age at engagement impacted outcomes favorably. At six years post-intervention, FBP
participants exhibited greater cortisol production in response to a conflict discussion task versus literature control (Luecken et al.,
2010). Mediation analysis indicated that greater positive parenting and reduced exposure to negative life events predicted lower
externalizing symptoms which predicted higher cortisol responsivity (Luecken et al., 2014). Although NBP participation did not
predict cortisol response to the TSST task, further analysis revealed age-based effects such that control youth age 10.5 and older
showed exaggerated cortisol reactivity versus NBP counterparts, and control children age 10.5 and younger demonstrated greater
blunted response than NBP children of equivalent age (Luecken et al., 2015). Mediated analyses showed that youth-reported maternal
warmth predicted later lower cortisol production in this group (Luecken, Hagan, Wolchik, Sandler, & Tein, 2016).
6.5.3.2. Epigenetic outcomes. Epigenetic outcomes were assessed three times in SAAF and once in AIM, and demonstrated benefit of
intervention on adolescent health. Beach, Lei, Brody, and Philibert (2016) and Brody et al. (2009) found that SAAF participants with
the risky short allele (“s”) of the gene 5-HTTLPR were less likely to initiate early substance use versus literature control counterparts,
indicating effects of intervention on epigenetic regulation. In turn, intervention status and short allele type mediated the relationship
between early substance use and methylation of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene (Beach et al., 2016). Brody, Gray, et al. (2016)
also found favorable SAAF effects on epigenetic regulation. SAAF youth with or without parental depression did not differ in
epigenetic cellular aging at age 20 whereas control youth with parental depression reports had accelerated cellular aging, potentially
indicating protective effects of intervention. Epigenetic aging and parental depression predicted later emotional problems in control
participants but not among SAAF (Brody, Yu, Chen, Beach, & Miller, 2016). Finally, participants of AIM who reported prior non-
supportive parenting did not experience diminished telomere length five years post-intervention, whereas the control group did;
telomere length was sustained in AIM intervention youth who benefitted from intervention-associated reduction in anger (Brody, Yu,
Beach, & Philibert, 2015).
6.5.3.3. Immune system, metabolic, CNS, SAM axis, and sleep disturbance outcomes. SAAF programming also ameliorated adversity-
related immune, metabolic, CNS, and SAM axis dysfunction with parenting playing a role in improved outcomes. At an eight-year
follow-up, SAAF participants had lower individual and composite inflammatory marker profiles than literature control comparison
(Miller, Brody, Yu, & Chen, 2014). Greater nurturant and consistent parenting, developed post-intervention, was associated with the
lowest inflammatory profiles in SAAF youth (Miller et al., 2014). ACEs reported by SAAF participants did not relate to odds of
prediabetes, however for the control group, every point increase in ACE score indicated 37% greater likelihood of prediabetes.
Furthermore, despite equivalent reports of ACEs, SAAF participants experienced lower prevalence of prediabetes than control (Brody,
Yu, Chen, & Miller, 2017). Additionally, years of family poverty during adolescence did not reduce hippocampal and amygdala
volumes for SAAF youth; however, control participants experienced significant reductions in these areas. Reduced hippocampal and
reduced amygdala volumes were associated with depressive symptoms and smoking behavior respectively in at follow-up (Brody,
Gray, et al., 2016). Finally, SAAF participation buffered norepinephrine and epinephrine levels at age 20. Levels were elevated for
control youth who reported non-supportive parenting or parental psychological dysfunction during early adolescence; such reports
did not impact SAM axis functioning among SAAF youth, although results for norepinephrine were more robust (Brody, Yu, Chen, &
Miller, 2014). Finally, adolescent girls receiving PE therapy due to sexual abuse, experienced fewer sleep disturbances after therapy
versus active control (Brownlow et al., 2016).

There was a significant difference in risk behavior among LC and SAAF
youth with and without the genetic risk factor (“s” allele). ANCOVA: (F3,
435) = 4.36, p < 0.01, ANOVA: F(6, 872) = 4.18, p < 0.001. LC control
youth were more likely to initiate risky behaviors than SAAF youth with or
without the genetic risk factor or LC youth without the genetic risk factor.
The mean risk behavior initiation index was greater for LC control versus
other groups, p < 0.05. Path analysis showed that increased regulated,
communicative parenting (β = 0.30, p < 0.05) in SAAF predicted limited
lack of supervision (β = −0.17, p < 0.05) which protected SAAF youth
with genetic risk from risk initiation (β = 0.20, p < 0.05)

 7. Discussion
This review is the first of its kind to synthesize and evaluate the impact of interventions on multiple types of biological health
outcomes in adversity-exposed youth randomized to specialized care. It is noteworthy that a concentration of intervention studies on
this topic were published toward the end of the study timeframe, indicating increasing and recent interest in improving the health of
impacted children through intervention programming. Furthermore, while the HPA axis has been a traditional targeted biomarker in
stress research, recent studies have addressed a diverse range of outcomes, including epigenetic and neurological markers, pointing to
the recognition that early life stress has widespread biological consequences which should be evaluated. Additionally, despite var-
iation among sample types, the literature provides evidence for the stabilization or improvement of children’s health due to biological
embedding of adversity.
7.1. Institutionalized children
We found that among children with a history of institutional care, many central nervous system outcomes for intervention
children improved or normalized overall, including white matter integrity and volume, and alpha and theta frequency power, with
earlier placement improving some of these outcomes (Vanderwert et al., 2016; Bick et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2008; McLaughlin
et al., 2011; Sheridan et al., 2012; Vanderwert et al., 2010). Epigenetic outcomes were also favorable whereas results on ANS and
HPA axis functioning in response to stressor were inconsistent but indicate patterns of blunted response for control group and more
favorable outcomes for earlier intervention placement (Hoye, 2015; Humphreys et al., 2016; Vanderwert et al., 2016; McLaughlin
et al., 2011). In addition, parenting traits and stability improved growth outcomes (Johnson, 2010).
7.2. Children in foster care
In the foster care setting, ABC, CPP/PPI, and MTFC-P interventions, all developed for young children, were effective overall at
addressing morning and diurnal cortisol dysregulation (Bernard, Dozier, et al., 2015; Bernard, Dozier, et al., 2015; Cicchetti et al.,
2011; Fisher et al., 2007; Laurent et al., 2014). Foster care intervention youth were protected from dysregulation of their stress
responses due to placement changes and starting school, however the majority of interventions did not play a beneficial role in the
context of researcher-implemented stress tests (Graham et al., 2017; Dozier et al., 2008; Fisher et al., 2011; Graham et al., 2012). In
the single study on foster care adolescents, improvement in cortisol production and immune functioning was more promising with
greater intervention engagement (Pace et al., 2012).
7.3. Children in community settings
In community settings, the SAAF intervention ameliorated various health outcomes including immune, metabolic, CNS, SAM axis
markers, and demonstrated epigenetic regulatory effects (Luecken et al., 2014; Brody et al., 2015; Beach et al., 2016; Beach et al.,
2016; Brody et al., 2009; Brody, Gray, et al., 2016; Beach et al., 2016; Brody, Yu, et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2014). Epigenetic
regulatory effects and sleep-related outcomes were impacted, through the AIM, and PE interventions respectively (Brownlow et al.,
2016; Beach et al., 2016). In response to researcher-induced stressors, NBP and FBP teenagers exhibited expected cortisol reactivity,
particularly when factors such age and parenting characteristics were taken into account (Luecken et al., 2010, 2014, 2015, Beach
et al., 2016). Among younger community samples, cortisol outcomes were favorable in two of three studies (Brotman et al., 2007;
Bugental et al., 2010; Letourneau et al., 2011).
7.4. Across settings
Across settings, intervention programs were successful in improving or normalizing many biological health outcomes for children
exposed to adversity. However, children from these settings may experience adversity and intervention treatment differently, due to
their unique environments and therefore generalizability of interventions is important to consider. Children raised in institutional
care in their early years likely experienced more severe stress than their counterparts in foster care and community settings – these
later study groups were often based in Western countries likely to have a stronger infrastructure and greater access to basic needs.
Institutionalized children who were randomized to specialized foster care transitioned into a dramatically more nurturing en-
vironment. The ability of children raised in extreme environments to subsequently prosper across many biological outcomes is telling.
Among foster care children, many have been exposed not only to the initial trauma, but separation from the primary caregiver, and
possibly multiple placement changes. These youth were often placed in high quality and intense intervention programs, and the
majority benefited in respect to improved HPA axis functioning. Finally, children in community settings were the most diverse as
exposures, outcomes, demographic makeup, and intervention programming greatly varied in this group. However, this group is likely
to reflect the typical population as serviced by health providers and should be closely evaluated. Despite sample and setting dif-
ferences, this review points to how reversal of biological embedding of childhood stress is possible in the most extreme and varied of
contexts, and presents valuable implications for the field.

 7.5. Implications for practice
Lessons from the intervention literature have implications for disrupting toxic stress. Based on study findings, health care
practitioners should emphasize strategies that improve the health of children and adolescents who have experienced adversity. Across
sample types, three key elements facilitated intervention effectiveness on biological health outcomes: strong parenting skills, earlier
intervention placement, and greater intervention engagement. Supportive and positive parenting, specifically greater responsiveness,
nurturance, warmth, sensitivity, and strong attachment should be promoted based on the evidence that these factors played a role in
improving outcomes among intervention children and adolescents (Brody, Yu, et al., 2016; Brody et al., 2014; Bugental et al., 2010;
Johnson, 2010; Luecken et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2014). Leaders in the field have also documented and called for greater attention to
supportive and responsive caregiving to promote early childhood development and reduce the risk of poor outcomes later in the life
course (Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, 2017; Asok, Bernard, Roth, Rosen, & Dozier, 2013; Center on the
Developing Child at Harvard University, 2016).
Furthermore, earlier engagement demonstrated better HPA axis, ANS, and CNS outcomes for children; some improved outcomes
were limited to placement before 18 and 24 months of age (McLaughlin et al., 2011; McLaughlin et al., 2015; Vanderwert et al.,
2010). Research shows that the first wave of substantial brain development occurs within the first few years of life and therefore this
window is a one of the critical periods for intervention (Tottenham & Sheridan, 2010). Additionally, cortisol patterns tend to nor-
malize for children by age two and particular genotypes may be most influential at specific developmental periods (Drury, Gleason,
et al., 2012; Drury, Theall, et al., 2012; Gunnar & Donzella, 2002). The benefits of earlier age at intervention were not apparent for
adolescents however, pointing to challenges with reversing biological embedding of adversity during later childhood, although the
adolescence presents unique opportunities for brain development during puberty (Dahl, 2004; Luecken et al., 2010; Verhulst, 2017).
Finally, some programs demonstrated better HPA axis and immune system outcomes in relation to greater engagement with
intervention components, for both children and adolescents (Graham et al., 2017; Pace et al., 2013). Practitioners should develop
programs that are feasible, attractive, and culturally-sensitive for families in order to increase retention. Barriers to accessing services
must be assessed and targeted simultaneously. Additionally, engaging communities in translational science can support in creating
programs that are responsive to their needs (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, n.d.; Wallerstein & Duran, 2010).
7.6. Recommendations for future research
While some intervention features were clearly advantageous for children and adolescents exposed to adversity, further research
remains warranted in this relatively novel field of translational science. Although many child adversity exposures were evaluated in
this review, additional exposures linked to poor health require attention, including stressors such as bullying (Knack, Jensen-
Campbell, & Baum, 2011). Health implications may also vary depending on the type of adversity exposure, as shown in the literature
(Bruce et al., 2009). Additionally, cumulative exposure to adversities, as well as interactions between specific adversities require
attention, given the greater health impacts of cumulative adversity (Wing et al., 2015). Furthermore, research linking mechanisms of
child adversity and health outcomes is still underway. Many of the biomarker outcomes in this review have been shown to have
implications for poor health but are not necessarily an endpoint to disease. Therefore researchers must explore what these biological
outcomes imply for longitudinal development of disease and what additional markers can be reliably targeted for intervention,
including additional biomarkers implicated in the adversity literature, such as additional inflammatory and sympathetic nervous
system markers (Kuras et al., 2017; Slopen, Kubzansky, McLaughlin, & Koenen, 2013).
Evaluating mediating factors can support in understanding biological mechanisms. Reviewed studies found that parenting
characteristics and youth mental and behavioral health mediated intervention effects on some biological outcomes (Brody et al.,
2015; Luecken et al., 2014). Additionally, some studies documented subsequent poor mental, behavioral and cognitive outcomes for
youth as a result of dysregulation of biological systems (Bick et al., 2017; Bugental et al., 2010; McLaughlin et al., 2011). The role of
mental health in mediating physical health outcomes has been mixed however and requires ongoing investigation (McLaughlin et al.,
2016; Scott, 2011). Furthermore, consistent evaluation of epigenetic regulatory effects can support in elucidating pathways of
biological embedding of adversity and intervention effects. Moreover, youth may have genetic factors that influence how they
differentially respond to stressors, and benefit from intervention programs (Beach et al., 2016; Silveira et al., 2016; Wickrama, Lee, &
O’Neal, 2017).
To understand nuances of intervention effectiveness, researchers must disaggregate data by gender, age, pubertal status and
specific intervention components. Research indicates that gender, age and pubertal status are important factors in understanding
brain development and the stress response (Juster et al., 2016; Watamura, Donzella, Alwin, & Gunnar, 2003). However, in the many
of the reviewed studies, these variables were either controlled for, or given little attention, particularly with respect to pubertal
status. Furthermore, while mediation analyses demonstrated the beneficial impact of parenting characteristics, specific intervention
components, especially in multi-disciplinary treatments must be evaluated for their unique impacts. Some intervention programs
improved specific outcomes but not others; researchers must explore whether and how such outcomes are modifiable and whether
alternative intervention strategies are needed. Finally, the concept of resilience was not emphasized in the intervention studies,
despite growing literature on how adversity-exposed children may have internal (and external) systems in place to adapt and thrive in
the context of adversity and in response to stress (Chen & Miller, 2012; Ellis, Bianchi, Griskevicius, & Frankenhuis, 2017). On a
similar note, researchers should continue to evaluate the effects of protective or buffering factors on treatment response, as well as
whether these factors exist prior to the intervention, or develop as a result of the intervention.

 7.7. Limitations
Some study design limitations should be highlighted and therefore, generalizability of intervention programs is cautioned.
Although reviewed studies utilized an RCT design, objective outcome measures, and normative comparison samples (in some stu-
dies), lack of physiological baseline data, and high attrition were leading concerns. Future RCTs should prioritize evaluating out-
comes at baseline and longitudinally at multiple time points, and work toward enrolling larger samples which can support finer
analyses addressing gaps described previously. Replicability and evaluation of interventions in multiple settings and samples is also
needed prior to reaching consensus of best practices.
Next, with respect to the design of this review, it is possible that relevant intervention articles may be missing due to adversity
exposures and biological health search terms not accounted for. Additionally, the trauma field may have addressed biological
consequences of stressful experiences through mental health treatment, however from our analysis, most captured relevant articles
did not meet study design criteria and/or did not specify adverse exposures in abstracts, and as a result, these studies are not included
in this review. Generalizability is cautioned due to the variation across study context (sample and setting), adversity exposure, and
variation in biomarker measurement.
8. Conclusion
This review presents the latest science on the impact of interventions to improve biological health of children who have ex-
perienced early life stress. This field holds promise in that interventions can indeed improve or normalize outcomes in children
exposed to adversity across institutional, foster care, and community settings. Recommendations for future intervention research and
practice point to importance of early intervention engagement, engagement adherence, and parenting skills for intervention im-
plementation, as well as rigorous research that takes into account the complexity of biological mechanisms of adversity, its health
consequences, and the role of interventions in ameliorating poor outcomes. Although the intervention sciences require further in-
vestigation prior to widespread translation to clinical practice, the prior decade of intervention research provides valuable lessons to
inform progress and ongoing endeavors to address toxic stress in children and adolescents.
