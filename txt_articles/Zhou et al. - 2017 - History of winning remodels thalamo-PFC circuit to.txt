Mental strength and history of winning play an important role in the determination of social
dominance. However, the neural circuits mediating these intrinsic and extrinsic factors
have remained unclear. Working in mice, we identified a dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
(dmPFC) neural population showing “effort”-related firing during moment-to-moment
competition in the dominance tube test. Activation or inhibition of the dmPFC induces
instant winning or losing, respectively. In vivo optogenetic-based long-term potentiation
and depression experiments establish that the mediodorsal thalamic input to the dmPFC
mediates long-lasting changes in the social dominance status that are affected by history
of winning. The same neural circuit also underlies transfer of dominance between different
social contests. These results provide a framework for understanding the circuit basis of
adaptive and pathological social behaviors.
I
n most social species, reaching the top of the
social hierarchy is strongly affected by mental
strength or personality traits (including cour-
age, perseverance, and motivational drive), as
well as a previous history of winning (1–6).
The formation of a dominance hierarchy can
result from a reinforcing mechanism known as
the “winner effect,” where animals increase their
probability of victory after prior winning (7–11).
The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) has
been implicated in the chronic regulation of social
dominance (12–18). However, the acute require-
ment of the dmPFC during ongoing social com-
petition and the upstream neural circuits that
regulate dmPFC activity in dominance behav-
iors have been essentially unknown. It has also
been unclear whether the winner effect can be
generalized—in other words, whether dominance
acquired in one type of competition can transfer
to another behavioral type.
Winner mice display more pushes and
resistances in the dominance tube test
To investigate social competition in laboratory
mice, we applied the dominance tube test (19),
which is highly transitive and stable and cor-
relates well with other dominance measures
(6). The behavior in the tube test was video-
monitored and categorized as push initiation,
push-back, resistance, retreat, or stillness (Fig. 1,
A and B; fig. S1A; movie S1; and methods).
Analysis of 72 tube test trials revealed that win-
ner mice initiated significantly more pushes, and
with a longer duration per push, than loser mice
(Fig. 1C). When being pushed, winner mice also
showed more and longer push-backs and resist-
ances and fewer retreats (Fig. 1, D to F). For a
cage of four male weight-matched C57BL/6J
mice, we derived a linear dominance rank order
based on total numbers of wins against cagemates
in pairwise tube tests (18) (fig. S1B). Opponents with
closer rank distances spent a longer time and gen-
erated more pushes (fig. S1, C and D) in the tube.
dmPFC neurons activated in effortful
behavioral epochs during social contests
We performed single-unit recordings in freely
behaving mice while they engaged in the tube
test (Fig. 1G). Using 16-channel tetrodes targeting
dmPFC [including the anterior part of the anterior
cingulate (ACC) and the prelimbic (PL) part of the
PFC (fig. S2, A and B)], we successfully recorded
342 well-isolated neurons in 22 mice, including
306 putative pyramidal (pPyr, 89.5%) and 36
putative fast-spiking interneuron (pIN) cells (fig.
S2, C and D; criteria for single-unit isolation and
cell-type classification are given in the methods).
We aligned spiking activity with epochs of push-
ing (including push initiation and push-back),
resistance, retreat, and stillness (Fig. 1H and meth-
ods). The average firing rate of recorded pPyr
units was significantly higher during the “effort-
ful” (push and resistance) behavioral epochs, but
not the passive (retreat) behavioral epochs, than
during stillness (Fig. 1, H and I, and movie S2). In
contrast, the average firing rate of pIN units in-
creased insignificantly during the retreat epoch
(Fig. 1J). A notable fraction of the pPyr units showed
increased firing rates during push (11.4%, 31 of
271 units) and resistance (10.1%, 25 of 247 units)
behaviors, significantly more than the fraction that
showed decreased firingrates (1.1% forpushing,P <
0.0001, Z test; 2% for resistance, P = 0.002, Z test;
Fig. 1K and fig. S2E). One-third of neurons (11 of 31)
with increased activity during push behavior also
showed an increase in firing rate during resistance,
which was significantly higher than the chance
level (P < 0.0001, Z test; Fig. 1L). These 11 neurons
showed highly correlated increases in activity dur-
ing push and resistance behaviors [linear regres-
sion analysis, coefficient of determination (R2) =
0.82, slope = 0.90, P < 0.001; Fig. 1M]. Although
both pushing and resistance require effort, they
differ in that the former involves body movement,
whereas the latter does not. Thus, regardless of
whether the animal is in motion, these two dif-
ferent behavioral states tend to recruit the same
subset of dmPFC neurons.
DREADD inhibition of dmPFC reduces
effortful behaviors and causes losing
Given that dmPFC neuronal activity is differen-
tially modulated when animals make an effort dur-
ing competition, we next tested whether dmPFC
neural activity is required for dominance in the
tube test. We applied the DREADD (designer re-
ceptors exclusively activated by designer drugs)
method to inactivate dmPFC neurons, using an
adeno-associated virus (AAV2) expressing the engi-
neered Gi-coupled hM4D receptor (20) (Fig. 2A
and fig. S3, A and B). Whole-cell recordings of
neurons from acutely isolated dmPFC brain slices
confirmed that clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 5 mM)
suppressed hM4D-expressing dmPFC neuron activ-
ity (Fig. 2B), causing a significantly increased
spike threshold and decreased spike number
under current step injections (Fig. 2, C and D). We
then intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected CNO (5 mg
per kilogram of body weight) into a subset of mice
(each from a different four-mouse group), which
had hM4D expressed bilaterally in the dmPFC
and had stable tube test ranks (persisting for at
least three continuous daily trials before the ma-
nipulation; Fig. 2E). This treatment induced a de-
cline in tube test ranks of the injected mice, starting
at 1 to 1.5 hours and peaking at 6 to 8 hours after
injection (Fig. 2, E to G and fig. S3C). There were
significantly fewer and shorter initiated pushes
and push-backs, and more retreats, after CNO
injection (Fig. 2, H and I). At 24 hours after CNO
injection, most mice returned to their original
rank position (Fig. 2, E to G), consistent with the
reversal of the effect on cell physiology after CNO
washout (Fig. 2B).

 Optogenetic activation of dmPFC
induces instantaneous winning in the
tube test
Using optogenetics, we next tested whether dmPFC
activation is sufficient to quickly induce domi-
nance behavior in social competition. AAV2 virus
expressing light-sensitive channelrhodopsin (ChR2)
(21) under the control of the ubiquitously expressed
CAG promoter (AAV-CAG-ChR2-tdTomato) was
stereotactically injected into the right dmPFC of
the ranked mice and expressed for 4 weeks,
and an optic fiber was implanted directly above
the injection site (Fig. 3, A and B; fig. S4; and
methods). dmPFC neurons show both phasic and
tonic firing patterns (22). We thus first used a
100-Hz phasic protocol (9.9 ms per pulse, four
pulses per second; fig. S5A) with 473-nm laser
stimulation, which significantly increased the
expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos in
the illuminated side of the dmPFC (P < 0.05;
Fig. 3B). Whole-cell recordings in dmPFC brain
slices showed that both a 100-Hz phasic protocol
and a 5-Hz tonic protocol (fig. S5B) efficiently
activated dmPFC neurons (Fig. 3, C and D), and

 this was also verified by in vivo optrode record-
ings of the single-unit responses from virally
injected animals (Fig. 3, E and F).
In tube tests with pairs of mice, we delivered
the 100-Hz phasic light protocol to one of the
mice to activate its dmPFC immediately before
it entered the tube to confront its opponent, and
we kept the light on throughout the test, which
lasted, on average, 12.8 ± 1.3 s (n = 93; Fig. 3G).
This instantaneously induced winning against
previously dominant opponents with a 90% suc-
cess rate (Fig. 3, G and H; fig. S5C, J and K; and
movie S3), without affecting the motor perform-
ance or anxiety level (fig. S6). The same photo-
stimulation protocol did not affect the tube test
rank of mice injected with AAV-Ubi-eGFP virus
(eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein) in
the dmPFC (Fig. 3I and fig. S5F). The 5-Hz tonic
stimulation protocol had a similar success rate
(80%) in elevating the rank of stimulated mice
(Fig. 3J and fig. S5, D, J, and K).
Under photostimulation, the originally sub-
ordinate mice not only resisted pushes from the
opponents for a longer duration, but also pushed
more (Fig. 3K). The laser intensity required to
dominate the opponents correlated with the rank
distance that the mouse needed to move: A rank
increase of three (rank 4 moving to rank 1) re-
quired laser intensity that was 3.2-fold that re-
quired for a rank increase of two (rank 4 to rank
2 or rank 3 to rank 1) and 7.1-fold that required
for a rank increase of one (rank 4 to rank 3, rank
3 to rank 2, or rank 2 to rank 1), demonstrating a
dosage-dependent relationship between the level
of dmPFC activation and the amount of effort
required (Fig. 3L).
Importantly, dmPFC photoactivation did not
change muscle strength, as assessed by measuring
grip strength during the light-on and -off periods
(fig. S7A). Most (98%, n = 103) photostimulated
tube test wins occurred within less than 1 min,
suggesting that testosterone, a conventionally
slow-acting hormone, is unlikely to have played
a role in this quick process. To confirm this, we
measured the levels of testosterone at 1 min and

 1.5 hours after photostimulation and found them
to be indistinguishable from the baseline and un-
stimulated control levels (fig. S7B). To test whether
theincreaseddominanceismanifestedby a height-
ened level of basal aggression, we subjected mice
to the resident-intruder assay (23), during which
we intermittently turned the 473-nm light (5 Hz,
10 ms) on and off in 1-min epochs with a switched
sequence. The test mice showed low basal ag-
gression levels and no significant difference
between the light-on and -off periods in aggres-
sive behaviors (including attacks and chases;
fig. S7, C to F, and movie S4). Furthermore, the
dmPFC-photostimulated mice also showed a nor-
mal preference toward novel mice in the social
memory test (fig. S7, G and H).
With localized injection, we mapped the effec-
tive site to a dmPFC site containing both the
anterior part of the ACC and the PL region
(Figs. 2A and 3A and fig. S4). A more dorsal and
posterior part of the ACC (Fig. 3M and fig. S8, A
and B) and a ventral mPFC site mostly contain-
ing the infralimbic cortex (Fig. 3M and fig. S8,
C and D) were not effective in stimulating winning
behavior (Fig. 3M and fig. S5, G and H). For cell-
type specificity, we used a CaMKII (calcium- and
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) promoter

found that it was sufficient to elevate tube test rank
(Fig. 3J and fig. S5, I to K).
Synaptic strength in the MDT-dmPFC
circuit underlies the winner effect
in the tube test
Performance in the tube test diverged on the
second day after photostimulation: Some mice
returned to their original rank, whereas others
maintained their newly elevated rank (Fig. 3H
and 4A). Comparison of their experiences revealed
that these mice differed in the number of winning
trials on the stimulation day: Mice receiving more
than six photostimulated wins all maintained
their new rank, whereas most mice receiving
fewer than five photostimulated wins returned
to their original rank (Fig. 4A). This sustained
rank elevation was not caused by a secondary
effect through the experience of nonstimulated
rival mice (fig. S9). Thus, repeated stimulated
winning led to sustained dominance without
further photostimulation, reflecting the winner
effect. Systematic injection of MK801 (0.15 mg/
kg, i.p.) eliminated the sustained winning in-
duced by six photostimulated wins, suggesting
that an NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor)–
dependent plasticity mechanism may mediate
this long-lasting increase in dominance (Fig. 4B
and fig. S10A).
We next searched for the neural circuit path-
way that supports this behavioral plasticity mecha-
nism. The mPFC receives prominent projections
from the mediodorsal thalamus (MDT) (24), and
the MDT-dmPFC circuit shows synaptic weaken-
ing during repeated defeat–induced social avoidance
(25). We thus hypothesized that this same pathway
may undergo long-lasting synaptic strengthening
after repeated winning. If that is the case, we
should be able to (i) detect enhanced synaptic
strength in the MDT-dmPFC pathway after re-
peated winning, (ii) eliminate the sustained win-
ning by introducing long-term depression (LTD)
to reverse the synaptic strengthening in the MDT-
mPFC circuit, and (iii) directly cause sustained
winning by inducing long-term potentiation (LTP)
in the MDT-mPFC synapses without any tube
test competition. We expressed oCHIEF, a var-
iant of ChR2 that can faithfully respond to 100-Hz
stimulation (fig. S11A) (26, 27), in the MDT (fig.
S12, A to C) and implanted an optrode (for elec-
trophysiology recording) or an optic fiber (for
behavioral manipulation) in the dmPFC (Fig. 4C;
fig. S12, D and E; and methods). Optical activa-
tion of the MDT axonal terminals in the dmPFC
(5 Hz, 10 ms) induced instantaneous winning in
the tube test (fig. S12F).
To measure synaptic responses of the MDT-
dmPFC pathway in free-moving mice, we recorded
field response in the dmPFC evoked by photo-
stimulation of the oCHIEF-expressing MDT-
dmPFC axonal terminals. Brief pulses of blue
light were delivered at 0.05 Hz through the opti-
cal fiber, and fEPSPs (field excitatory postsynaptic
potentials) were used to measure the MDT-dmPFC
synaptic efficacy (fig. S11, B and C) (27). After a
stable baseline was acquired for at least 3 days,

Downloaded from 
 we photostimulated the MDT-dmPFC axonal
terminals to induce repeated winning six times
and measured the fEPSPs on the following days.
Accompanying the rank elevation, the fEPSP of
the MDT-dmPFC pathway was significantly in-
creased on the following 2 days after repeated
winning, reflecting strengthening of the MDT-
dmPFC synapses (Fig. 4D).
Next, by applying low-frequency stimulation
(LFS), an optical LTD protocol (900 pulses of 2-ms
light stimulation delivered at 1 Hz; fig. S11D)
(27, 28), at the MDT-dmPFC terminals, we were
able to induce LTD in the MDT-dmPFC synapses
(Fig. 4E) and eliminate the sustained winning
effect after six stimulated wins (Fig. 4F and fig.
S10B). Conversely, delivery of high-frequency
stimulation (HFS), an optical LTP protocol (fig.
S11A and methods) (28), at the MDT-dmPFC
terminals significantly potentiated MDT-dmPFC
transmission in vivo (Fig. 4G). Application of this
in vivo LTP protocol to freely moving mice in the
home cage caused significant, long-lasting tube
test rank increases (Fig. 4H and fig. S10C).
Transferrable winner effect from the
tube test to the warm spot competition
We next asked whether dominance acquired in
the tube tests can transfer to other forms of domi-
nance behavior. We subjected mice to an inde-
pendent measure of social hierarchy, the warm
spot test, in which four cagemate C57 mice com-
peted for a warm corner in a cage with an ice-
cold floor (Fig. 5A). The amount of time that each
mouse occupied the warm spot correlated with
its tube test rank (Fig. 5, B to D, and movie S5),
cross-validating that these two assays share
dominance as a common core variable. Activation
of dmPFC neurons by using AAV2 expressing
the engineered Gq-coupled hM3D receptor (20)
increased the occupation time and rank in the
warm spot test at 2 hours, but not 2 days, after
CNO injection (1 mg/kg, i.p.) (Fig. 5, E and F).
We then tested whether sustained winning in
the tube test resulting from repeated dmPFC stim-
ulation could lead to increased rank in the warm
spot test. After we subjected mice that were pre-
viously subordinate in both tests to 10 photo-
stimulated tube test wins, their occupation times
and ranks in the warm spot test were significantly
elevated compared with their performances be-
fore the tube test (P = 0.016 for occupation time,
P = 0.016 for rank, Wilcoxon signed-rank test;
Fig. 5, G to I), even though these mice were not
directly stimulated in the warm spot context.
Discussion
Collectively, these results provide strong evidence
that activation of the dmPFC is both necessary
and sufficient to quickly induce winning in social
competitions. Specifically, by optogenetically isolat-
ing a synaptic input from the MDT to the dmPFC,
we could selectively manipulate synapses driven
by this input and establish a causal relationship
between the activity of the MDT-dmPFC circuit
and dominance behavior. dmPFC activation does
not seem to boost dominance by enhancing basal
aggression level or physical strength (fig. S7), but
rather by initiating and maintaining more effort-
ful behaviors in social competition (Fig. 3K). The
mPFC has been implicated in cost-benefit analysis

We propose that these mPFC-based cognitive pro-
cesses may provide a neurobiological foundation
for dominance-associated personality traits, such
as perseverance or competitive drive.
One important parameter for the cost-benefit
computation in a social confrontation is the his-
tory of winning. With the in vivo optogenetic LTP
and LTD experiments, we provide evidence that
synapses in the MDT-dmPFC pathway may en-
code winning history. Whereas earlier work on
the winner effect in fish was mostly focused on
hormonal changes after repeated winning (33),
our results reveal that the synaptic plasticity
mechanism in the MDT-dmPFC circuit plays a
key role in the winner effect in mammals. More-
over, we discovered a generalized form of the
winner effect, where dominance transfers from
one contest type to another through a shared
neural circuit mechanism. Previous studies of
the winner effect were restricted to the impact of
winning on the same behavior paradigm (33).
However, given that animals are dealing with
different forms of competition in setting up the
social hierarchy, the generalized winner effect
that we describe here is of high evolutionary
importance—for example, it may allow a monkey
that succeeds in fighting for bananas earlier to
occupy a more comfortable resting spot later.
Such reciprocal reinforcement between winning
in different behavioral paradigms would help to
accelerate the establishment of a stable domi-
nance hierarchy (Fig. 5J). It may also have im-
portant implications in cognitive training for
competitive games. Considering that an excess
or lack of dominance drive is associated with many
personality disorders and mental problems, our
results might shed light on the treatment of
these psychiatric diseases.
