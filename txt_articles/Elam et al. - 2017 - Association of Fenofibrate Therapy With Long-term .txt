IMPORTANCE Patients with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in
part owing to hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. It is
unknown whether adding triglyceride-lowering treatment to statin reduces this risk.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether fenofibrate reduces CVD risk in statin-treated patients
with type 2 diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Posttrial follow-up of the Action to Control Cardiovascu-
lar Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Study between July 2009 and October 2014; 5 years of
follow-up were completed for a total of 9.7 years at general community and academic
outpatient research clinics in the United States and Canada. Of the original 5518 ACCORD Lipid
Trial participants, 4644 surviving participants were selected based on the presence of type 2
diabetes and either prevalent CVD or CVD risk factors and high-density lipoprotein levels less
than 50 mg/dL (<55 mg/dL for women and African American individuals).
INTERVENTIONS Passive follow-up of study participants previously treated with fenofibrate
or masked placebo.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Occurrence of cardiovascular outcomes including primary
composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke in all participants
and in prespecified subgroups.
RESULTS The 4644 follow-on study participants were broadly representative of the original
ACCORD study population and included significant numbers of women (n = 1445; 31%),
nonwhite individuals (n = 1094; 21%), and those with preexisting cardiovascular events
(n = 1620; 35%). Only 4.3% of study participants continued treatment with fenofibrate
following completion of ACCORD. High-density lipoprotein and triglyceride values rapidly
equalized among participants originally randomized to fenofibrate or placebo. Over a median
total postrandomization follow-up of 9.7 years, the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary study
outcome among participants originally randomized to fenofibrate vs placebo (HR, 0.93; 95%
CI, 0.83-1.05; P = .25) was comparable with that originally observed in ACCORD (HR, 0.92;
95% CI, 0.79-1,08; P = .32). Despite these overall neutral results, we continued to find
evidence that fenofibrate therapy effectively reduced CVD in study participants with
dyslipidemia, defined as triglyceride levels greater than 204 mg/dL and high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels less than 34 mg/dL (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.95).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Extended follow-up of ACCORD-lipid trial participants
confirms the original neutral effect of fenofibrate in the overall study cohort. The continued
observation of heterogeneity of treatment response by baseline lipids suggests that
fenofibrate therapy may reduce CVD in patients with diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia and
low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. A definitive trial of fibrate therapy in this patient
population is needed to confirm these findings.

C
ardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is increased in
patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly in older
patients and those with other risk factors for CVD.
Compared with their counterparts without diabetes, the
relative risk of fatal and nonfatal CVD events can be 2- to
3-fold and 3- to 4-fold higher, respectively, in men and
women with diabetes.1-4 Increased risk of CVD in type 2
diabetes is attributable in part to the high prevalence of
associated risk factors including hypertension and diabetic
dyslipidemia, the latter characterized by elevated plasma
triglyceride levels and low plasma levels of high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).5,6 The Action to Control
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) was a random-
ized, multicenter, partial double 2 × 2 factorial trial that
enrolled 10 251 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus
who were at high risk of CVD events. The ACCORD study
tested the effects of intensive control of blood glucose,
blood pressure, and plasma lipids on CVD risk in patients
with type 2 diabetes.7
The ACCORD-Lipid was conducted in a subset of 5518
ACCORD participants and tested the hypothesis that combi-
nation statin-fibrate therapy would more effectively reduce
CVD risk compared with statin alone in patients with type 2
diabetes. Although triglycerides and HDL-C are widely rec-
ognized as biomarkers of CVD risk,8 it is uncertain whether
pharmacologic therapy directed toward lowering triglycer-
ide levels and raising HDL-C effectively reduces that risk,
particularly when added to statin therapy. In ACCORD-
Lipid, following a mean 4.7 years of treatment, the rate of
occurrence of the composite primary outcome measure of
myocardial infarction, stroke, and fatal CVD was not signifi-
cantly lower in participants randomized to fenofibrate
therapy compared with those randomized to placebo.9
There were also no significant differences between the 2
study groups for any of the prespecified secondary out-
comes, including fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal MI,
or nonfatal stroke.9 In contrast to these findings, prespeci-
fied subgroup analyses in ACCORD-Lipid detected signifi-
cant heterogeneity in treatment effect by baseline lipids
suggesting benefit for those with dyslipidemia, predefined
as having both high triglycerides and low HDL-C levels at
baseline. Heterogeneity in fenofibrate response was also
noted by sex, with evidence of benefit for men vs possible
harm in women.
The neutral overall CVD outcomes of the glycemia,
blood pressure, and lipid treatment arms of ACCORD, along
with the findings of heterogeneity of the effect of fenofibrate
on cardiovascular outcomes in ACCORD-Lipid,9-12 supported
the need for additional follow-up of participants to detect
emergence of long-term “legacy” effects of the interventions
and to explore the findings of heterogeneity by baseline dys-
lipidemia and sex. The ACCORD Follow-On Study (ACCOR-
DION) was designed and conducted for this purpose. In this
study, we describe the outcome of extended observational
follow-up of ACCORD-Lipid participants in ACCORDION. The
extended follow-up findings of the ACCORD blood pressure
and glycemia intervention groups have been or will be
reported separately.13
Methods
ACCORD and ACCORDION Study Design, Eligibility,
and Conduct
The rationale, design, and primary results of ACCORD were
previously reported.9-12,14 Briefly, all participants underwent
2 sequential randomizations, the first to intensive vs stan-
dardglucose-loweringtherapyintheoverarchingglycemiatrial
and the second to either intensive vs standard blood pressure
or lipid therapy in the ACCORD-Blood Pressure or ACCORD-
Lipid trials, respectively, in a partial double 2 × 2 design
(Figure 1). The primary outcome for all 3 trials was the first oc-
currence of a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal
stroke, or death from a cardiovascular cause. Participants were
recruited from 77 clinical sites across the United States and
Canada between January 2001 and October 2005. Follow-up
of ACCORD ended in June of 2009.
The ACCORD-Lipid trial, conducted in 5518 participants,
was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind treat-
ment arm of ACCORD in which all participants received sim-
vastatin to attain contemporary guideline-based low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment goals7,15 and were
randomlyassignedtoreceiveeitherfenofibrateormatchedpla-
cebo. In addition to fulfilling the overall ACCORD eligibility cri-
teria, participants were specifically eligible for ACCORD-
Lipid if they also met the following: (1) LDL-C levels between
60 mg/dL and 180 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter,
multiply by 0.0259), inclusive; (2) HDL-C levels less than 55
mg/dL for women and African American individuals less than
50 mg/dL for all other groups (to convert to millimoles per li-
ter, multiply by 0.0259); and (3) triglyceride levels less than
750 mg/dL if not receiving a lipid medication or less than 400
mg/dL if receiving a lipid medication (to convert to milli-
moles per liter, multiply by 0.0113). All participants provided
written informed consent. Open-labeled simvastatin therapy
began at the randomization visit, and the dose was modified
over time in response to changing guidelines.15 The masked
fenofibrate/placebo medication was fenofibrate was 160 mg/d
in participants with normal renal function and 48 mg/d for
Key Points
Question Does fenofibrate reduce cardiovascular disease risk in
statin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes?
Findings In this posttrial follow-up of the Action to Control
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Lipid Study, fenofibrate therapy
was associated with reduced cardiovascular disease in study
participants with dyslipidemia, defined as triglyceride levels
greater than 204 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels less than 34 mg/dL.
Meaning Extended follow-up of ACCORD-lipid trial participants
confirms the original neutral effect of fenofibrate in the overall
study cohort; the continued observation of heterogeneity of
treatment response by baseline lipids suggests that fenofibrate
therapy may reduce CVD in patients with diabetes with
hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

TheACCORDcloseoutvisitswerecompletedbyJune2009.
Following approval by the coordinating center (Wake Forest
University) and participating clinical site institutional review
board approvals, consenting participants were invited at these
final trial visits to participate in the posttrial, nontreatment,
observation-onlyACCORDIONstudy.Participantcontactswere
scheduled approximately every 6 months. These consisted of
2 in-clinic with 4 additional telephone visits annually. Infor-
mation was collected regarding CVD events, hospitalizations,
and medication usage. In-clinic visits also included a physi-
cal examination and, at the first and last visits, collection of
urine and blood samples for analysis, a standardized electro-
cardiogram recording, and health-related quality of life data.
Follow-up ended on October 31, 2014, or 60 months post-
ACCORD, for a total of 5 years of posttrial observation. More
detailedinformationcanbefoundintheACCORDIONtrialpro-
tocol (Supplement 2). A complete listing of the ACCORD/
ACCORDION study group is provided in Supplement 1.
Prespecified Outcomes, Subgroups, Event Ascertainment
The prespecified primary outcome for ACCORDION-Lipid was
the same as for ACCORD: the first postrandomization occur-
rence of a major cardiovascular event, specifically nonfatal
myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardio-
vascular causes.7 Secondary outcomes included an ex-
panded composite macrovascular outcome, a major coro-
nary heart disease event, nonfatal myocardial infarction,
nonfatal stroke, total fatal/nonfatal stroke, all-cause mortal-
ity, cardiovascular mortality, total fatal/nonfatal congestive
heart failure, and CVD-free survival. The consistency of inter-
vention effects was also examined across the same prespeci-
fied baseline subgroups examined in ACCORD including sex,
age, race/ethnicity, baseline CVD history, hemoglobin A1c, gly-
cemia treatment assignment, tertiles of LDL-C, HDL-C ,and tri-
glyceride, as well as in those with and without dyslipidemia
at baseline (defined as the combination of the highest tertile
of triglyceride and lowest tertile of HDL-C).
Based on findings of concordance between outcomes
reported by investigators and adjudication of outcomes by a
centralized endpoint committee in ACCORD (eTable 1 in
Supplement 3) The ACCORDION analyses were conducted
using outcomes reported by site investigators during both the
active (trial) and passive follow-up period, regardless of the
original adjudication classification.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were done by the ACCORDION Coordinat-
ing Center using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), according to
a prespecified plan that was finalized before any analyses be-
gan.Anominal2-tailedlevelofsignificanceofP < .05wasused
for all analyses without adjustment for multiple testing.
Baseline characteristics of participants enrolled in
ACCORD-Lipid and a comparison of those who consented to
the posttrial passive follow-up were summarized using means,
standard deviations, and percentages. Effects of the original
interventions on lipid levels during the active treatment phase
and subsequent follow-up were estimated by calculating the
mean lipid levels and 95% confidence intervals at follow-up
visits by treatment group from the date of randomization
through the end of the trial and then beyond through the end
of ACCORDION. Follow-up for each participant was defined as
the time from randomization until the last date for which the
participant’
s health status was available (Figure 1). All com-
parisons of intervention groups were performed according to
the intention-to-treat principle.16
Analyses were conducted using both the original mean 4.7
years of treatment (ACCORD) and with addition of the 5 years
of passive posttrial follow-up in ACCORDION, for a mean of 9.7
years of follow-up. The number and annual percentage of par-
ticipants who had a postrandomization event was determined
using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Cox proportional hazards re-
gression analyses were used to estimate the long-term effect of
allocation to either fenofibrate or placebo on the primary and

group within the Cox models.
Results
Of the original 5518 men and women enrolled in the ACCORD-
Lipid Trial,9 4644 provided written consent to be followed
up during the posttrial period, representing 90% of surviving
participants. The baseline characteristics at the time of entry
into ACCORD among those consenting to participate in
ACCORDION were similar to those of the entire original
ACCORD-Lipidcohortincludingplasmalipoproteinsandpreva-
lence of preventive therapies such as statins (Table 1). In con-
trast, the 874 ACCORD participants who did not consent to
post-ACCORD follow-up, including those who died during
ACCORD, were older, more likely to be nonwhite, and more
likely to have had a prior cardiovascular event, a lower preva-
lence of statin therapy, and a higher LDL-C on entry into
ACCORD (Table 1).
Themeandurationoffollow-upduringACCORD-Lipidwas
4.7 years for the primary outcome and 5.0 years for all-cause
mortality. With the addition of posttrial follow-up, the over-
all mean duration of follow-up was 7.7 years for the primary
outcome and 9.1 years for all-cause mortality. The maximum
length of follow-up for individual participants was more than
12 years. At the final ACCORD study visit, 4754 of the partici-
pants (86.0%) remained on a statin and 2137 participants
(77.3%) originally assigned to fenofibrate remained on
fenofibrate.9 Following completion of ACCORD, further lipid
treatment was guided by primary care clinicians who contin-
ued to prescribe statin therapy in 2476 ACCORDION partici-
pants (74.1%). In contrast, only 144 ACCORDION participants
(4.3%) were continued or started on fibrate therapy following
completion of ACCORD.
Plasma Lipids
At the time of entry into ACCORD, fasting plasma lipids at base-
line were similar between the participants assigned to feno-
fibrate and placebo9 (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3). At entry into
ACCORD, 3299 ACCORD-Lipid trial participants (59.8%) were
already on statin therapy, and mean LDL was approximately
100 mg/dL (Table 1). During ACCORD, all participants were
treatedwithsimvastatinatadoseof20mg/dto40mg/d.9Low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels progressively de-
creased to a mean of 80 mg/dL in the placebo group and 81.1
mg/dL in the fenofibrate group over the course of the trial be-
cause statin therapy was initiated in all participants and was
intensified in response to accrual of safety information and in
response to evolving guidelines9,15,17 (eFigure 1 in Supplement
3). During the posttrial follow-up period, LDL-C levels de-
clined slightly from a mean of 80.2 mg/dL at the first fol-
low-up visit to an average of 77 mg/dL in both groups. During
ACCORD,triglyceridelevelswerereducedby22%,fromamean
of 187 mg/dL to 145 mg/dL in participants randomized to fe-
nofibrate and declined 8.7%, from a mean of 186.2 mg/dL to
170 mg/dL in those randomized to placebo9 (eFigure 1 in
Supplement 3). During the posttrial period, triglyceride lev-
els continued to decline in the placebo group and increased
in the fenofibrate group to a mean of 160.8 mg/dL in both
groups, reflecting high rates of discontinuation of fibrate
therapy following completion of ACCORD (eFigure 1 in
Supplement 3). During ACCORD, HDL-C increased 8.4% in the
fenofibrate group (from 38.0 mg/dL to 41.2 mg/dL) and 6.0%
in the placebo group (from 38.2 mg/dL to 40.5 mg/dL).9 Dur-
ing the posttrial period, HDL-C levels declined to a mean level
of 40.5 mg/dL in participants originally randomized to feno-
fibrate to levels comparable with those in participants origi-
nally randomized to placebo (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3).
Clinical Outcomes
Rates of occurrence by treatment assignment and hazard ra-
tios for investigator-reported primary and secondary cardio-
vascular outcome measures during the entire study period, in-
cludingextendedfollow-up,arepresentedinTable2.Following
a mean of 9.0 total years of follow-up, 508 primary end point
events occurred in the fenofibrate group vs 539 in the pla-
cebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.05; P = .25)
(Table 2). The annual primary outcome rate was 2.38% among
participants randomized to fenofibrate vs 2.55% among those
randomized to placebo. The HR for the primary end point dur-
ing extended follow-up in ACCORDION was essentially iden-
ticaltothatobservedduringthe4.7-yearactivetreatmentphase
of ACCORD (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.79-1.08; P = .32) (Table 2).
Thus, the additional 5 years of follow-up did not change the
original neutral findings of the ACCORD study.9 Similarly, the
hazard ratios for the secondary outcomes, including the
individual components of the primary outcome, were not sta-
tistically different between treatment groups and were com-
parablewiththoseobservedduringACCORD(Table2).Kaplan-
Meier curves describing the almost 10-year accumulation of
major cardiovascular events in the 2 groups visually confirm
the comparable rates of accrual of outcomes in the 2 treat-
ment groups (Figure 2).
In contrast to the overall neutral effect of fenofibrate
therapy in the entire ACCORD cohort, heterogeneity in the ef-
fect of fenofibrate on the primary cardiovascular outcome con-
tinued to be observed during extended follow-up in those with
dyslipidemia at study entry. During the combined trial plus
posttrial period, the primary outcome in study participants
with dyslipidemia who were randomized to fenofibrate was
27% lower than among those with dyslipidemia randomized
to placebo but only 1% lower in nondyslipidemic study par-
ticipants (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.95 vs HR, 0.99; 95% CI,
0.86-1.13; P = .05 for dyslipidemic vs non-dyslipidemic, re-
spectively) (Figure 3). Persistent heterogeneity in fenofibrate

mary outcome in the fenofibrate treatment group was 16%
lower for men but 30% higher for women (HR, 0.84; 95% CI,
0.73-0.96 vs HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10-1.68; P = .003 for men vs
women, respectively) (Figure 3). These HRs are nearly iden-
tical to those observed in the original ACCORD trial (eTable 2
in Supplement 3).9
Discussion
Up to 35% of patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk
of atherosclerotic CVD events related to the presence of dia-
betic dyslipidemia, defined as hypertriglyceridemia and the
associated accumulation of remnant particles, low HDL-C, and

small dense LDL.8,19 However, it is unclear whether pharma-
cologic therapy directed toward reversing these abnormali-
ties will result in reduced risk of CVD. Although the cardio-
vascular efficacy of niacin and fibrate (gemfibrozil)
monotherapy was clearly established by prestatin-era clini-
cal trials,20-22 subsequent trials failed to demonstrate effi-
cacy of newer fibrates, specifically fenofibrate and bezafi-
brate either alone23,24 or in combination with statin.9
Furthermore, between 2007 and 2016, a number of trials test-
ing various triglyceride-lowering and HDL-C–raising medical
therapies have failed to demonstrate benefit of add-on therapy
in statin-treated patients.25-28 These clinical trial outcomes are
reflected in treatment guidelines promulgated by the Ameri-
can Heart Association and the American College of Cardiol-
ogy that focus on recommendations for statin therapy but do
not clearly advocate the use of triglyceride-lowering therapy
for CVD prevention.29
In the case of fenofibrate, 2 cardiovascular end point trials
conducted within the last decade failed to show benefit with
administration of fenofibrate in patients with type 2 diabetes
either alone in the FIELD study24 or as add-on therapy to statin
intheACCORDstudy.9Amongthepossiblereasonsfortheneu-
tral outcome of FIELD was a disproportionately higher drop
in statin therapy in the fenofibrate group.24 In ACCORD, one
possible reason for failure to demonstrate benefit of add-on
fenofibratetherapywasthatthetreatmentdurationof4.7years
was not sufficient to detect a treatment effect. The goal of
ACCORDION was to extend the study with an additional 5.0
years of passive follow-up to detect emergence of a “legacy”
effect of fenofibrate treatment, similar to that observed in the
niacin arm of the Coronary Drug Project30 and with glucose
lowering in both the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes
Study and the 2008 Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial.31,32 A
legacy effect did not emerge during extended follow-up in

ACCORDION, thus confirming the original overall ACCORD
observations. On the other hand, the lower cardiovascular
event rates observed among the subgroup of participants with
hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C who were randomized
to fenofibrate therapy during the active treatment phase of
ACCORD continued to be observed during the extended fol-
low-up period. These findings support the hypothesis that in-
dividuals with diabetic dyslipidemia may benefit from add-on
fenofibrate therapy. This hypothesis is supported by the com-
parable findings of similar subgroup analyses of several ma-
jor fibrate trials including the FIELD study,33 the Helsinki Heart
Study (HHS),34 Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention Trial (BIP),23
and VA-HDL Intervention Trial (VA-HIT).35 Insofar as the tri-
glyceride-lowering effect of fibrates is greatest among pa-
tients with hypertriglyceridemia,34 it is not totally unex-
pected that individuals with hypertriglyceridemia would be
mostlikelytobenefitfromfibratetherapy.Thiswasclearlyevi-
dent in the lipid response to fenofibrate in the hypertriglyc-
eridemia/low–HDL-C subset of ACCORD-Lipid participants
(eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 3). However, in
ACCORD-Lipid, this subset comprised only 17% of all partici-
pants (n = 941).9
The sex differences in fenofibrate response observed in
ACCORD9 were also observed during extended follow-up in
ACCORDION. The observation of sex differences in cardiovas-
cular outcomes with fenofibrate treatment, with men appear-
ing to benefit vs evidence of possible harm in women in
ACCORD9 and now with extended follow-up in ACCORDION,
isbothunexpectedandunexplained,particularlybecausesimi-
lar heterogeneity in fenofibrate treatment effect by sex was not
observed in the FIELD trial.24 These differences may be attrib-
uted to lower numbers of women participants in ACCORD vs
FIELD as well as unexpectedly low event rates among placebo-
treatedwomeninACCORD.36Therefore,thesexdifferencemay
be a chance finding.
It is important to note in the context of our findings that
the safety profile of combination therapy with fenofibrate and
statin appears to be acceptable. Specifically, in ACCORD, fe-
nofibrate was used in combination with simvastatin in more
than 2500 patients for a mean of 4.7 years without increased
incidence of muscle or liver toxicity.9 This is in distinct con-
trast to the increased risk of myopathy that occurs with coad-
ministration of the fibrate gemfibrozil and statin owing to a
known pharmacokinetic interaction.37,38 It is also important
to note that in ACCORD, fenofibrate treatment slowed pro-
gression of diabetic microvascular disease including retinopa-
thy and nephropathy.9,18 On the other hand, reversible in-
creases in creatinine and paradoxical lowering of HDL-C were
also observed with increased frequency in those randomized
to fenofibrate in ACCORD-Lipid.39,40
Limitations
It is also important to note that these prespecified subgroup
analyses can only be considered hypothesis-generating and in
some cases are based on a relatively small number of events.
Althoughanalysesbeyondtheoriginalpredefinedprimaryout-
come measure cannot be considered definitive and therefore
not suitable for guideline formulation or product labeling, they
inform refinement of our original hypothesis for further test-
ing and provide useful information to clinical practitioners re-
garding possible treatment for diabetic dyslipidemia.
Conclusions
In conclusion, an additional 5 years of follow-up of surviving
ACCORD-Lipid study cohort members extends the original
overallneutraloutcomeoftheACCORDstudyandprovidesad-
ditional support for possible benefit of fenofibrate therapy in
patients with type 2 diabetes in whom triglycerides remain el-
evatedandHDL-Clevelsremainlowdespitestatintherapy.Our
findingssupportthehypothesisthatpatientswithdiabeticdys-
lipidemia may derive some benefit from add-on triglyceride-
lowering therapy. Randomized trials testing the cardiovascu-
lar efficacy of fibrate as well as other triglyceride-lowering
treatments in this specific patient population are needed.
