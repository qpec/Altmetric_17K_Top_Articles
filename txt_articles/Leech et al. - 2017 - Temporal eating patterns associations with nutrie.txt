ABSTRACT
Background: Some evidence suggests that higher energy intake
(EI) later in the day is associated with poor diet quality and obesity.
However, EI at one eating occasion (EO) is also dependent on EI at
surrounding EOs. Studies that examine the distribution of EOs
across the day are rare.
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine associations be-
tween temporal eating patterns, nutrient intakes, diet quality, and
measures of adiposity in a representative sample of Australian adults.
Design: Dietary data from two 24-h recalls collected during the cross-
sectional 2011–2012 Australian National Nutrition and Physical Ac-
tivity Survey were analyzed (n = 4544 adults, aged $19 y). Temporal
eating patterns, based on the distribution of EOs across the day, were
determined by using latent class analysis. Diet quality estimated ad-
herence to healthy eating recommendations and was assessed by using
the 2013 Dietary Guidelines Index (DGI). Multivariate regression
models assessed associations between temporal eating patterns, nutri-
ent intakes, diet quality, and adiposity (body mass index, waist cir-
cumference, weight status, and central weight status). Models were
adjusted for potential confounders and energy misreporting.
Results: Three patterns, labeled “conventional,” “later lunch,” and
“grazing,” were identified. Compared with a “conventional” or
“later lunch” pattern, men and women with a “grazing” pattern
had lower DGI scores and higher intakes of discretionary (noncore)
foods (P , 0.05). Among women, the “grazing” pattern was asso-
ciated with overweight or obesity (OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.13)
and central overweight or obesity (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.50).
These associations were attenuated after the exclusion of energy
misreporters and adjustment for total EI.
Conclusions: This study found that a “grazing” temporal eating
pattern was modestly but significantly associated with poorer diet
quality and adiposity among women, after adjustment for covariates
and energy misreporting. Future research should consider the im-
pact of energy misreporting on the relation between temporal eating
patterns and adiposity. This secondary analysis was registered at
anzctr.org.au as ACTRN12617001029381.

INTRODUCTION
Chrono-nutrition is an emerging field of research that refers to
the temporal variations in the patterning and distribution of food
and beverage intake or eating occasions (EOs), including meals
and snacks, across the day (1). Animal studies have shown that
deviations from habitual eating patterns negatively affect met-
abolic and physiologic functions that are also regulated by cir-
cadian clock systems in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and peripheral
tissues (2, 3). For example, eating during the normal sleep cycle
(4) or consuming a high-fat meal at the end of a wake cycle (5)
negatively affected cardiometabolic health variables in mice.
In humans, nightshift work has been linked to an increased risk
of cardiometabolic diseases (6, 7). There is also evidence to
suggest that weight gain in shift workers may be related to poor
diet quality (8, 9). However, little research has examined tem-
poral eating patterns in relation to dietary intakes and health
outcomes in non–shift-work populations (10). Several epide-
miologic studies have reported a positive association between
evening energy intakes (EIs) and daily total EIs (11, 12) and
obesity (10, 13). The later timing of an EO has also been as-
sociated with higher total EIs (14) and less successful weight
loss (15). The causal effects of a later temporal eating pattern are
not clear. Intervention studies in this area vary with respect to
the populations, temporal eating patterns, and risk factors ex-
amined (16). Furthermore, most studies that examined temporal
eating patterns focused on the timing of EOs at isolated time
periods of the day, and this approach disregards EOs at other times

 of the day (10). The need for research that examines temporal
eating patterns in the context of both EO timing and frequency
across the day was also highlighted in a recent scientific statement
from the American Heart Association (16).
Studies that examine the temporal patterning of EOs across the
day are rare (17). Two studies found distinct temporal eating
patterns across the day when applying a data-driven analytic
approach, including cluster analysis (17) and latent class analysis
(LCA) (18). These methods were used to discover unknown
patterns in the data on the basis of an observed set of indicators
(e.g., time of EO consumption). Examples of patterns found by
using these methods include a “conventional” pattern, where
meals and snacks were evenly spaced and consumed at con-
ventional times in the United States and Australia, and a pattern
characterized by a higher eating frequency with less definitive
meal occasions (17, 18). These patterns were associated with
differences in sociodemographic and health characteristics (17,
18) and diet quality (17).
The identification of temporal eating patterns associated with
diet quality and obesity has important implications. These in-
clude providing insight into how the interplay between time and
dietary intakes may promote obesity and how current population-
based dietary advice for weight management could be improved
(19). Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether
temporal eating patterns, determined by using an LCA approach,
are related to nutrient intakes, diet quality, and measures of
adiposity in Australian adults.
METHODS
Sample and study design
This study was a secondary analysis of data from the nationally
representative 2011–2012 Australian National Nutrition and
Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS) and was registered at anzctr.
org.au as ACTRN12617001029381. This cross-sectional survey
was conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
Details of the study design and data collection methods have
been described elsewhere (20). Briefly, 12,153 persons aged
$2 y (of whom 9341 were adults aged $19 y) were sampled
from private households by using a multistage, probability
sampling design (Supplemental Figure 1). The initial response
rate (77%) and person-specific weights, adjusted for probability
of selection and nonresponse bias, were used to provide esti-
mates relating to the whole population. The Census and Statis-
tics Act 1905 provided ethics approval for the ABS to conduct
the household interview components of health surveys (20).
Anthropometric measurements
Measurement of height (centimeters), weight (kilograms), and
waist circumference (WC; centimeters) were taken to 1 decimal
point by trained ABS staff during a household interview by
using a portable stadiometer, digital scales, and a metal tape
measure, respectively. Anthropometric measurements were
voluntary and excluded pregnant women. BMI (kg/m2) was
calculated, and overweight or obesity was defined as having a
BMI $25 (21). Central overweight or obesity was defined as
WC $94 cm in men and $80 cm in women (22).
Dietary assessment
Methods to assess respondents’ dietary intake have been de-
scribed previously (20). In brief, dietary intake was collected
during two 24-h recalls, which were based on the validated
USDA automated multiple 5-pass method (23, 24). The dietary
recalls were conducted across all days of the week (except for
Sunday, unless requested by the participant). The second recall
was completed by 6053 (65%) of the initial adult respondents
on a different day w3–10 d after the first recall (average = w9 d)
(25). During each recall, respondents identified the time when each
EO commenced and the EO type (i.e., breakfast, lunch, dinner,
snack, beverage-only, etc.).
EOs
For the purpose of the analysis, an EO was defined as any
occasion at which food or drink was ingested and provided a
minimum energy content of 210 kJ (50 kcal) and was separated in
time from the surrounding EOs by 15 min. This definition of EO
has been shown to predict variance in total EI and measures of
adiposity more strongly than applying EO definitions with no
energy criterion (26, 27) or differing time intervals (16, 27). The
EI from EOs within each hour of the day was examined and
averaged across the 2 d of dietary recalls. To determine the
temporal pattern of EOs across the day, binary variables were
created to indicate whether or not an EO had occurred for each
hour of the day.
Food and nutrient intakes
Energy and nutrient intakes from all foods and beverages were
calculated by using the Australian Supplement and Nutrient
Database 2011–2013 (28). Mean estimates of energy, food, and
nutrient intakes and diet quality scores were obtained by aver-
aging dietary information across the 2 d of recall. Intakes of
foods in the Australian Guidelines to Healthy Eating were as-
sessed (29). These included intakes (servings per day) of the 5
core food groups (vegetables, fruit, grain foods, dairy and al-
ternatives, and lean meat and alternatives) and intakes of dis-
cretionary foods [noncore foods that are high in saturated fat,
added sugars, or both; e.g., sugary drinks, sweetened biscuits
(e.g., cookies), cakes, pastries, and processed meats]. Dietary
intakes of carbohydrates (grams), total sugars (grams), total fat
(grams), SFAs (grams), MUFAs (grams), PUFAs (grams), pro-
tein (grams), dietary fiber (grams), folate (micrograms), b-carotene
(micrograms), iodine (milligrams), sodium (milligrams), potassium
(milligrams), calcium (milligrams), and iron (milligrams) for
each participant were averaged across the 2 dietary recall days.
These nutrients are identified in the Australian Dietary Guidelines
and Nutrient Reference Values to play an important role in
preventing or promoting diet-related conditions with a high
burden of disease (30, 31). Sodium intakes included sodium
naturally present in foods and added during processing but did
not include salt added at the table or during cooking, because
estimated intakes on discretionary salt use were not collected
in the NNPAS. All nutrient intakes adjusted for total EI with
the use of the residual method by regressing nutrient intakes
on total EIs (32, 33).

 Diet quality
Overall diet quality was assessed by using a food-based diet
quality index, the 2013 version of the Dietary Guidelines Index
(DGI). The DGI has shown convergent (34) and predictive (35,
36) validity and has been described in detail previously (34–37).
Briefly, DGI scores are the sum of 13 dietary components, each
scored out of 10 possible points, reflecting proportional com-
pliance for meeting an Australian Dietary Guideline and include
meeting recommendations for food variety, salt use, and intakes
of the 5 core food groups, fluids, discretionary foods, SFAs,
unsaturated fat, added sugars, and alcohol. The possible total
score range is 0–130, with higher scores indicating better diet
quality.
Energy misreporting
Energy misreporting was assessed in this study to address
previous research that indicates that energy misreporting may
bias the relation between temporal eating patterns and obesity
(13) and that those who underreport EIs also underreport their EO
frequency (38, 39). The methods used to determine energy
misreporting have been described in detail previously (37).
Briefly, energy misreporting was assessed by using the ratio of
reported total EI to predicted total energy expenditure (EE;
EI:EE) (40). EE was calculated by using the validated sex- and
age-specific equations suitable for use in populations with a range
of weight statuses published in the US Dietary Reference Intakes
(41). Because the NNPAS assessed transport- and leisure-related
physical activity (PA) only and did not include a measure of
occupational PA or an objective measure of overall PA, a low-
active PA level (PAL; e.g., PAL $1.4 and ,1.6) was as-
sumed, which is consistent with previous research (40, 42). This
assumption is based on objectively measured population-level
PA data that show that most adults spend waking hours being
either sedentary or in light activity (43, 44). Participants were
identified as plausible reporters, underreporters, or overreporters
of EI on the basis of published calculations for the 61 SD cutoff
for EI:EE, which incorporates the CV in total EIs and predicted
total EE of NNPAS participants and the number of dietary recall
days used (40, 45).
Covariates
Information on respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics
and health behaviors was collected in the household survey (20).
Educational level was categorized as low (completed some high
school or less), medium (completed high school or completed
some high school or received a certificate or diploma), or high
(having a tertiary qualification). Country of birth was catego-
rized by the ABS as follows: Australia, other mainly English-
speaking countries (e.g., countries where English is the main or
official language spoken), and all other countries. Smoking
status was self-reported and categorized as current smoker,
ex-smoker, and never smoked. Frequency and duration of
moderate and vigorous PA during leisure-time and for transport
in the last week were assessed in the NNPAS by using questions
from the Active Australia Survey (46). Participants were cate-
gorized by the ABS as meeting or not meeting current Austra-
lian PA guidelines of 150 min and 5 sessions/wk (47).
Participants self-reported the total minutes spent in sedentary
behavior, defined as time spent sitting or lying down at work, or
during transport or leisure activities in the past week (20). Weekly
sedentary time was divided by 7 to derive daily sedentary time
(minutes). Participants reported their total sleep duration on the
night before the survey in minutes. Daily sleep time was converted
to hours by dividing estimates by 60. Participants also indicated
whether they were currently following a diet for weight loss or for
health reasons (yes or no).
Analytic sample
Participants were included in the analysis if they provided 2 d
of dietary recall and were not pregnant, breastfeeding, or had
undertaken shift-work in the past 4 mo (n = 5366; Supplemental
Figure 1). Participants were excluded if they reported no EI
during either of the 24-h recalls (n = 8) or did not report the time
at which an EO commenced (n = 116). Of the remaining 5242
participants, 665 (13%) had missing data for adiposity measures
and 33 (,1%) were missing data for covariates (PA and sed-
entary time), which left a final sample of 2127 men and 2417
women for the present analysis.
Statistical analysis
Temporal eating patterns
LCA, conducted in M-Plus version 7.31 (Muthen & Muthen),
was used to identify distinct temporal eating patterns in men and
women. The LCA procedures and a description of the resulting
patterns have been described in detail previously (18). In brief,
binary variables that indicate whether or not an EO (minimum
energy content of $210 kJ) had occurred within each hour of the
day were used as the input variables for the LCA. A model with
2 latent classes was tested first, and additional classes were
added until the optimal number of latent classes was identified.
Final class numbers were determined by the evaluation of model
fit indexes (e.g., Akaike information criterion and Bayesian in-
formation criterion), likelihood ratio tests comparing k with k21
class models, and pattern interpretability (48). After these
procedures, a 3-class solution was identified as the most ap-
propriate fit for the data (18). The reliability of the 3-class so-
lution was then examined by repeating the LCA procedures with
the use of 1 recall day of dietary intake, and similar temporal
eating patterns were found when comparing results with the use
of 1 compared with 2 d of dietary intake (18).
Descriptive analysis
Analyses that examined temporal eating patterns were con-
ducted in Stata 14 (StataCorp). Person weights and replicate
weights were applied to compute point estimates and SEs to
account for the probability of selection and the clustered survey
design, respectively (20). Descriptive statistics for sample
characteristics are presented as weighted means (95% CIs) or as
weighted percentages. After examining the distribution of the
data, BMI, energy and nutrient intakes, daily total sedentary time,
and EI:EE were log-transformed to improve normality. Weighted
geometric means (95% CIs) were used for all log-transformed
variables. The F test (for continuous data) and the adjusted
Pearson’s chi-square test (for categorical data) were used to
determine differences in sample characteristics by latent class of
temporal eating patterns.

 Associations for temporal eating patterns with nutrient intakes,
diet quality, and adiposity
Linear regression was used to adjust for differences in sample
characteristics between latent classes. Adjusted means (95% CIs)
for intakes of energy, nutrients, and food groups and diet quality
scores were estimated for each latent class. Multiple linear re-
gression (for continuous outcomes) and logistic regression (for
binary outcomes) were used to test for associations between
temporal eating patterns by using the “conventional” pattern as
the reference and the following measures of adiposity: BMI and
WC (continuous) and overweight or obesity and central over-
weight or obesity status (binary). Four models were tested.
Model 1 was an unadjusted model, whereas model 2 adjusted for
age (continuous), educational level (categorical), country of
birth (categorical), meeting PA guidelines (yes or no), daily
sedentary time (continuous), sleep time (continuous) smoking
status (categorical), daily energy-adjusted alcohol intake (grams
per day; continuous), dieting (binary), and DGI-2013 scores
(continuous). These covariates were selected on the basis of
their hypothesized relation with both dependent and independent
variables and the published literature. To assess the effect of
energy misreporting on the association between temporal eating
patterns and adiposity, model 3 additionally adjusted for EI:EE
(continuous), an approach used in previous studies (26, 40, 49).
To examine total EI in relation to reported associations between
temporal eating patterns and adiposity, model 4 additionally
adjusted for total EI after excluding energy misreporters (n = 694
men and n = 791 women) (50). Because total EI and EI:EE
are strongly and positively related, energy misreporters were
excluded in model 4 to additionally adjust for EI. All of the
models were checked for multicollinearity and appropriate
model fit by using regression diagnostics. For all of the analyses,
P , 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Characteristics of temporal eating patterns
The latent classes of temporal eating patterns for Australian
men and women participants in the NNPAS 2011–2012 have
been described previously (18). In brief, 3 latent classes, herein
referred to as temporal eating patterns, were identified for both
men and women and were similar. The labels given to each
pattern are based on the conditional probabilities for EOs oc-
curring at certain times of the day, relative to the other classes.
The first pattern, labeled “conventional” (42% men, 40%
women), was characterized by EOs occurring at conventional
meal times in Australia (e.g., lunch at 1200 and dinner at 1800)
and between conventional meal times at 1000 and 1500
(i.e., between-meal snacks). The second pattern, labeled “later
lunch” (34% men, 34% women), was distinguished by a lunch
EO that occurred 1 h later than the “conventional” pattern. The
third pattern, labeled “grazing” (24% men, 26% women), was
characterized by more frequent EOs and lower conditional prob-
abilities (e.g., ,0.7) of an EO occurring at conventional meal
times. A later timing of the first EO and higher conditional
probabilities for EOs occurring later in the day (e.g., after 2000)
were also observed for the “grazing” pattern when compared with
the “conventional” and “later lunch” patterns.
Table 1 presents the sociodemographic and health behavior
characteristics of men and women by latent class of temporal
eating patterns. There were significant differences (P , 0.05)
between temporal eating patterns for age, educational level,
country of birth, smoking status (men only), meeting PA
guidelines, daily sedentary time (men only), daily sleep time
(women only), total EIs, EI:EE, and WC (men only). Men with a
“conventional” temporal eating pattern had a significantly higher
BMI and a higher proportion were classified as overweight or

(P , 0.05).
Temporal eating patterns associated with energy-adjusted
nutrient intakes and diet quality
Tables 2 and 3 present energy-adjusted nutrient intakes, diet
quality scores, and selected food group intakes by temporal
eating patterns for men and women. After adjustment for mul-
tiple covariates, men with a “grazing” pattern had significantly
higher intakes of fat and saturated fat than those with the
“conventional” pattern. Women with a “grazing” pattern also
had significantly higher total EIs and lower energy-adjusted
intakes of protein than did women with a “conventional” or
“later lunch” pattern. Fiber and iron intakes were also signifi-
cantly lower in women with a “grazing” pattern than in women
with a “conventional” pattern. Diet quality scores and selected
food groups were associated with temporal eating patterns. The
lowest diet quality scores and the highest intakes of discretionary
foods were observed in both sexes with a “grazing” pattern. Men
with a “grazing” pattern also had lower intakes of grain foods than
did those with a “later lunch” pattern.
Associations between temporal eating patterns
and adiposity
The associations between temporal eating patterns and BMI
and overweight or obesity (BMI $25) for men and women are
presented in Table 4. In the unadjusted model, a significant
inverse association was found between the “grazing” pattern and
BMI and overweight or obesity among men only. These asso-
ciations were attenuated after adjustment for the covariates in-
cluded in model 2. After additional adjustment for EI:EE,
significant positive associations between the “grazing” pattern
and BMI and overweight or obesity were found among women
only. No significant associations were found between temporal
eating patterns and BMI or overweight or obesity after the ex-
clusion of energy misreporters and adjustment for total EI.
Results of the regression analyses for the associations between
temporal eating patterns and WC and central overweight or
obesity (men: WC $94 cm; women: WC $80 cm) are shown in
Table 5. In the unadjusted model, a significant inverse associ-
ation was found between the “grazing” pattern and WC and
central overweight or obesity among men only (P , 0.01).
However, these associations disappeared after adjustment for
covariates (model 2). After additional adjustment for EI:EE, a
significant positive association between the “grazing” pattern
and central overweight or obesity was found among women
(P , 0.01). This association was attenuated after the exclusion
of energy misreporters and adjustment for total EI.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies among adults
to examine associations for daily temporal eating patterns with
energy-adjusted nutrient intakes, diet quality, and adiposity (17).
A “grazing” pattern, identified by using LCA and characterized
by more frequent EOs found in our earlier study (18), was as-
sociated with lower diet quality and higher intakes of discre-
tionary foods in both men and women. Among women, this
pattern was associated with overweight or obesity and central

 overweight or obesity, after adjustment for covariates and EI:EE.
Although these associations were modest, the findings support
the use of a novel data-driven approach to capture temporal
eating patterns. This approach is conceptually important, because
it considers potentially meaningful interactions between the timing
and frequency of EOs across the entire day.
Studies that examined temporal eating patterns on the basis of
the timing of EOs across the day are rare. By using cluster
analysis, Eicher-Miller et al. (17) observed 4 temporal eating
patterns in a representative sample of 9326 US adults on the basis
of the timing and frequency of participant EOs and EIs. The
authors found a pattern characterized by less definitive but fre-
quently peaked intakes of energy, similar to the “grazing” pattern
found in the present study, which was significantly associated
with 2.6- to 5.9-units lower Healthy Eating Index-2005 scores
and obesity. The bivariate association with obesity, however,
might also be explained by the higher representation of night-
shift workers found in that cluster. Nonetheless, the findings
from this study are in line with our observed association between
a “grazing” pattern, lower DGI scores, and adiposity. Although
the observed differences in DGI scores of 1–3 units is modest,
previous research suggests that even small differences in diet
quality scores are associated with obesity (34, 35, 51, 52). How-
ever, these findings are based mainly on cross-sectional studies
and more prospective research is needed to confirm these
associations.
Only a few studies have examined the relation between
temporal eating patterns and intakes of energy or nutrients in
adults (12, 14, 53, 54). However, it is difficult to compare the
present results with these studies because they examined the
timing of EOs, EI, or macronutrient intakes at varying time
periods of the day that differ from ours. Later timing of the last
meal (14) and having a higher proportion of total EI later in the
day (e.g., evening or night) (12, 53, 54) have been associated with
higher overall EI, higher alcohol intakes (12), and lower per-
centage of energy from carbohydrates (12). In contrast, higher
EIs in the morning have been associated with lower overall EIs
(54). The “grazing” pattern observed in the present study was
characterized by a higher frequency of EO consumption after
2000, and among women, was significantly associated with
higher total EIs but lower energy-adjusted intakes of protein,
fiber, and iron when compared with a “conventional” pattern.
Although differences in total nutrient intakes were small, a cu-
mulative effect on health of small differences across a range of
nutrients cannot be discounted (55).
Evidence suggests that temporal eating patterns have changed
in recent times, with trends toward increasing EI later in the day
(56) and an increase in reported frequency of all EOs and snacks
(57). However, the consequences of these changes on obesity are
not clear. Studies have reported a progressive lowering of insulin
sensitivity and glucose tolerance into the evening, which explains
how a later temporal eating pattern may promote weight gain
(58–60). Two cross-sectional studies have found a positive as-
sociation between evening EI and BMI (13, 61). In addition, in a
crossover trial in 6 healthy lean volunteers that controlled for
total EI and macronutrient intake (59), higher glucose concen-
trations and diminished insulin sensitivity were observed in
participants who consumed a large evening meal that was high
in energy (w59% total EI) and carbohydrates, but low in fiber,
compared with those who consumed that same meal in the

 morning. However, it is unlikely that people would consume
more than half of their daily EI at one meal. Consequently,
studies that reflect everyday eating patterns are also needed to
inform the development of “meals-based” advice and strategies
that promote healthy eating and reduce the burden of obesity.
Not all studies have found an association between timing of the
last EO (14) or evening EI (12) and adiposity. The inconsistent
findings among observational studies may be attributed to dif-
ferences in how the timing and distribution of EI or EOs were
assessed. For example, studies have examined the proportion of
total EI across stratified time periods (e.g., morning, midday, or
evening) (13), the proportion of EI consumed after 1700 (12), and
the ratio of evening to morning EI (61). However, because in-
dividuals have multiple EOs across the day and the EIs at these
EOs are likely correlated, novel approaches, such as the use of
LCA or cluster analysis [e.g., the approaches used in this study
and in the study by Eicher-Miller et al. (17)] are needed to better
understand the relation between temporal eating patterns and
obesity.
In the present study, the adjusted associations between the
“grazing” pattern and overweight or obesity and central over-
weight or obesity among women were attenuated after adjust-
ment for total EI and the exclusion of energy misreporters.
Similarly, Wang et al. (13) found that the association between
evening EI and overweight or obesity disappeared after ex-
cluding energy misreporters. However, these findings should be
interpreted with caution, because evidence suggests that the
exclusion of energy misreporters may introduce selection bias
(62). Indeed, post hoc analysis of our data found that energy-
misreporting status was significantly associated with weight
status (x2 = 32.22, P = 0.0002) and 29% of overweight or
women compared with 17% of healthy-weight women were
classified as energy underreporters. Therefore, the attenuation of
results after excluding energy misreporters may reflect loss of
power due to the disproportionate exclusion of women who were
overweight or obese. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies
that consider the impact of energy misreporting on the relation
between temporal eating patterns, dietary intakes, and obesity
are warranted.
Strengths of this study include the large, nationally repre-
sentative sample and the novel methodology used to examine
temporal eating patterns on the basis of information on dietary
intake from two 24-h recalls. This study also examined associ-
ations with adiposity outcomes on the basis of objective an-
thropometric measurements and adjusted for multiple important
confounders and EI:EE.
Limitations of this study should also be considered. For ex-
ample, temporal eating patterns were determined by using 2 d of
dietary recall and may not capture within-person variation in
temporal eating patterns over time. Although individual dietary
intakes have been shown to vary day to day (63), further research
is needed to understand how temporal eating patterns vary over
time. Adjustment for intraindividual variability (a type of random
error) in dietary intakes may also increase the precision of es-
timates (33). Temporal eating patterns were determined with the
use of an exploratory, data-driven technique, and the findings may
therefore not be generalizable to populations from other coun-
tries. Finally, total predicted EE estimates that were used to
determine EI:EE assumed a low-active PAL. Future research
should use objective measures of PA or consider measuring EE by

subsample of participants.
In conclusion, distinct temporal eating patterns, determined by
using an LCA approach, were associated with modest but sig-
nificant differences in overall diet quality and measures of adi-
posity. Men and women with a “grazing” temporal eating pattern
had poorer DGI scores and higher intakes of discretionary foods
than did individuals with either a “conventional” or “later lunch”
pattern. Among women, the “grazing” pattern was also posi-
tively associated with overweight or obesity and central over-
weight or obesity, after adjustment for EI:EE. Although
associations with adiposity were attenuated after the exclusion
of energy misreporters and adjustment for total EI, this finding
may be explained by the introduction of selection bias. Future
research that considers the impact of energy misreporting on the
relation between temporal eating patterns and adiposity is
warranted.
The authors’ responsibilities were as follows—RML, SAM, AT, KML,
and AW: designed the research; RML: analyzed the data, wrote the manu-
script, and had primary responsibility for its final content; KML: prepared
the diet quality variables for analysis; and all authors: read and approved the
final manuscript. None of the authors reported a conflict of interest related to
the study.
