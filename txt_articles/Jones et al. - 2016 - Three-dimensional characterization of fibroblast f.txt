Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the prototypic fibrotic lung disease in which progressive scarring of 
the lungs leads to death by respiratory failure (1). The median survival of 3 years from diagnosis is worse 
than many cancers (2). Despite identification of activated fibroblasts as key effector cells pathologically 
remodeling the extracellular matrix, therapeutic options remain limited, and a better understanding of 
disease pathogenesis is required (3–5).
Diagnosis of IPF is based on recognition of the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on 
chest high-resolution CT or surgical lung biopsy (1). The histological pattern of UIP is believed to be 
produced by the consequences of repeated epithelial injury together with unfettered fibroproliferation 
(6). Aggregates of proliferating fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, termed “fibroblast foci,” are a key his-
tological diagnostic feature of UIP thought to represent areas of active fibrosis (7). On standard 2D 
pathologic examination fibroblast foci are considered small, distinct lesions, and their profusion has 
been reported to be of prognostic significance, although study findings vary (8–12). They have been 
proposed to be linked in a complex reticulum that is highly interconnected and extends from the pleura 
In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the fibroblast focus is a key histological feature representing 
active fibroproliferation. On standard 2D pathologic examination, fibroblast foci are considered 
small, distinct lesions, although they have been proposed to form a highly interconnected reticulum 
as the leading edge of a “wave” of fibrosis. Here, we characterized fibroblast focus morphology 
and interrelationships in 3D using an integrated micro-CT and histological methodology. In 3D, 
fibroblast foci were morphologically complex structures, with large variations in shape and volume 
(range, 1.3 × 104 to 9.9 × 107 μm3). Within each tissue sample numerous multiform foci were present, 
ranging from a minimum of 0.9 per mm3 of lung tissue to a maximum of 11.1 per mm3 of lung tissue. 
Each focus was an independent structure, and no interconnections were observed. Together, our 
data indicate that in 3D fibroblast foci form a constellation of heterogeneous structures with large 
variations in shape and volume, suggesting previously unrecognized plasticity. No evidence of 
interconnectivity was identified, consistent with the concept that foci represent discrete sites of 
lung injury and repair.

into the underlying parenchyma (13), yet the 3D morphology and spatial interrelationships of fibroblast 
foci remain poorly understood.
Micro-CT allows nondestructive imaging of tissue 3D microarchitecture, down to spatial resolutions, 
in the order of 1 to 10 μm (14, 15). It has informed our understanding of distal airways disease in patients 
with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic lung allograft rejection (16, 17). In 
fibrotic lung diseases, micro-CT imaging has been employed for quantification of fibrosis in small animal 
studies (18–23); however, as samples have required processing with contrast agents or air inflation prior to 
fixation, application to diagnostic human interstitial lung disease (ILD) tissue samples has not been pos-
sible, with extremely limited tissue access. We have recently developed a protocol that allows imaging of 
routinely prepared formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human lung tissue samples by micro-CT (24). This 
nondestructive process can be applied to tissue used for diagnosis, and conventional histopathologic sec-
tioning of the tissue can subsequently be performed; this enables cellular or molecular information from 
methodologies such as immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization to be precisely coregistered within 
the volumetric data set from micro-CT.
Given the pivotal nature of fibroproliferation to the progression of IPF and the key role that fibroblast 
foci are believed to play in this process (6), new insights into the structure of these lesions may further 
advance our understanding of whether they are interlinked in a complex reticulum as the leading edge 
of a “wave” of fibrosis or they comprise multiple distinct structures that have arisen as a consequence of 
multifocal lung injury (6, 13). In our study, we applied an integrated micro-CT and histological methodol-
ogy on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded diagnostic lung tissue to study the morphology of fibroblast foci 
in 3D. Our work demonstrates the potential for 3D imaging methodologies to further inform concepts of 
the underlying pathogenesis of fibrotic lung diseases and reveals that, in contrast to current understanding 
from standard pathology of 2D tissue sections, in 3D fibroblast foci form a constellation of heterogeneous 
structures, with large variations in shape and volume, suggesting previously unrecognized plasticity. We 
identify no evidence of general interconnectivity, consistent with the concept that foci represent discrete 
sites of lung injury and repair.
Results
Micro-CT of  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissue identifies diagnostic features of  the UIP pattern. First, we 
assessed visualization of diagnostic paraffin-embedded lung tissue 3D microarchitecture by micro-CT. 
Micro-CT enabled interactive multiplanar assessment of tissue microarchitecture (Supplemental Video 1; 
Figure 1. 3D volume renderings of normal and usual interstitial pneumonia/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lung tissue imaged by micro-CT. Cubes (2 mm 
per side) of (A) normal lung tissue and (B) usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue were digitally extracted from 
the reconstructed micro-CT lung tissue volumes following removal of paraffin by absolute thresholding. For reference on the superior surface, a coregis-
tered histological section stained with Movat’s Pentachrome is displayed. Morphological differences in 3D are apparent with UIP/IPF tissue, demonstrat-
ing loss of alveolar structures and increased parenchymal thickness, with an impression of “fullness” within the UIP/IPF tissue.

supplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/jci.insight.86375DS1). 3D reconstruc-
tions identified clear morphological differences between normal and IPF lung tissue, with volume renderings 
in Figure 1 demonstrating loss of alveolar structures and increased parenchymal thickness in IPF, consistent 
with previous stereological findings (25). Supplemental Videos 2 and 3 visualize rotation of these volume 
renderings. Feature correspondence between corresponding histological sections and micro-CT slices of IPF 
lung tissue was assessed, with qualitative comparison (Figure 2) demonstrating that micro-CT can visual-
ize normal lung structural features, such as airways, blood vessels, and alveolar airspaces, in addition to 
structural features of the UIP pattern, including heterogeneity of the distribution of interstitial fibrosis and 
normal appearing lung, architectural distortion, and honeycomb change.
Fibroblast foci are locally complex, heterogeneous structures in 3D. We then studied whether fibroblast foci 
were identifiable in micro-CT image data. Correlation of histological slices and coregistered micro-CT 
images established features that typically enabled identification of fibroblast foci greater than 200 μm when 
integrated with visualization in 3 different planes (xy, xz, yz), specifically when the foci were adjacent to 
airspaces, given their reduced gray scale intensity when compared with surrounding tissue, as illustrated in 
Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 1.
Initial visual 3-plane micro-CT analyses suggested a locally complex fibroblast focus morphology in 
3D that was not apparent on cross-sectional 2D histopathologic examination. To confirm this finding, we 
performed histological identification of fibroblast foci, followed by segmentation of the corresponding 
image sections within the micro-CT volume to enable accurate integrated assessment of their 3D struc-
ture. Fibroblast foci were digitally labeled in the corresponding micro-CT slice every 8 μm over 1,000 
μm, using the segmentation editor, having been identified in the histological sections as aggregates of 
spindle-shaped cells with a characteristic blue-green color on Movat’s pentachrome–stained sections or 
pale color on hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections; these stainings represent focal deposits of young, 
immature collagen and proteoglycans within the subepithelial interstitium. All foci within the micro-CT 
field of view were labeled. 3D visualization and quantification of the segmented data identified complex 
discrete structures with marked variation in size and shape (Figure 4, Table 1, Supplemental Figure 2, and 
Supplemental Video 4) that appear to be a nonuniform process. The 3D render visualized in Figure 4 is 
available for download (Supplemental Render 1).
Fibroblast focus volumes ranged from 1.6 × 104 μm3 to 9.9 × 107 μm3. No evidence of substantial 
extension of individual foci inwards from the pleura to the parenchyma was identified. Review of digitally 
imaged sequential 2D histology sections identified the complex morphology of an individual fibroblast 
focus in 3D, with a number of apparently independent fibroblast foci in 2D identified to form one morpho-
logically discrete structure. These foci ranged from relatively simple 3D structures (Supplemental Figure 3) 
to more morphologically complex structures adjacent to established fibrosis (Figure 5).
Fibroblast foci are not generally interconnected. Micro-CT 3-plane visualization, 3D segmentations (Figure 
6 and Supplemental Video 5), and sequential 2D histology section review were evaluated for evidence of 
fibroblast focus interconnectivity at a larger scale, with numerous independent multiform fibroblast struc-
tures identified in each tissue volume and fibroblast focus frequency ranging from 0.9 to 11.1 per mm3 of 
lung tissue. The Euler number, a measure of redundancy in a network, was calculated for each case and 
identified no evidence of fibroblast focus interconnectivity (see Supplemental Table 1 and refs. 26, 27).

the threshold fixed at the mean gray scale value of a 1-mm3 volume of paraffin. The subvolume (256 mm3) of the micro-CT data corresponding to the 
histological stack was extracted, and the tissue volume was quantified. Fibroblast foci were digitally labeled within the micro-CT volume, and volume, 
surface area, and density were quantified.

Given the identified variability of foci in 3D, fibroblast focus profusion on 2D histological sections 
was then semiquantitatively and quantitatively assessed over a depth of 1 mm of lung tissue from each 
patient. Analyses identified variability both quantitatively (up to 4-fold intratissue variation) and semi-
quantitatively (Supplemental Figure 4). An exploratory analysis investigating the association between 
3D fibroblast focus density and change in forced vital capacity (FVC) over 1 year identified a negative 
correlation (Supplemental Figure 5).
Discussion
Through an integrated histological and micro-CT analysis of IPF lung tissue we characterized fibroblast 
foci in 3D, identifying that they are morphologically complex structures with large variations in shape and 
volume. Within each tissue sample, numerous discrete fibroblast structures were present, without evidence 
of general interconnectivity.
While IPF remains an idiopathic disease, there have been several proposals regarding mechanisms 
of pathogenesis, one of which is that fibroblast foci form a highly complex and interconnected reticulum 
extending from the pleura to the lung parenchyma as a “wave” of progressive fibroproliferation (13, 28, 
29). This concept was informed by a study from Cool et al., in which a computer-generated 3D recon-
struction and Euler connectivity analysis of histological sections over a depth of 500 μm were proposed 
to demonstrate an interconnected fibroblast reticulum (13). However, the methodological advances of our 
work enabled analysis of far larger tissue volumes than previously possible, and we identified that the

preceding reconstruction scale was consistent with visualization of one fibroblast focus of comparable 
dimensions to that shown in Figure 4. With multiple methodologies, our analyses showed that fibroblast 
foci are independent, discrete structures and, as a group, are not part of a reticulum. In support of this 
finding, human androgen receptor gene methylation assay analysis of foci by Cool et al. identified balanced 
methylation, indicating polyclonality of foci (13). Our results are consistent with the concept that fibroblast 
foci represent discrete nonconnected sites of localized lung injury, with 3D reconstructions identifying a 
constellation of independent fibroblast structures in support of the paradigm that IPF is a consequence of 
aberrant wound healing responses to local microinjuries (6).
At a 2D cross-sectional histological level, fibroblast foci are usually considered small, distinct 
lesions (7, 30), although they are often found grouped in proximity, forming what are thought to be 
areas of active fibrosis. Our results showed that, in 3D, foci in proximity and typically with shared 
areas of established fibrosis form one complex discrete fibroblast structure. A heterogeneous population 
was identified with large variations in size and shape and over a 100-fold difference between largest 
and smallest volume fibroblast foci. Acknowledging that the cause of lung injury in IPF has yet to be 
determined, we speculated a number of possibilities for this finding, which suggests previously unrec-
ognized plasticity. It is possible that the size and morphology of an individual focus reflects the extent 
and distribution of injury at a lung surface. Alternatively, volume variation could indicate temporal 
growth of foci, with the smallest foci occurring at the most recent sites of injury. The latter possibility is 
in keeping with our identification of small isolated foci. Further work would be required to investigate 
these relationships in more detail.

While increased profusion of fibroblast foci has been proposed to correlate with mortality in patients 
with IPF, a number of studies have identified no association, and the clinical significance of this finding 
remains uncertain (8–12). Differences in patient selection and methodology have been suggested to account 
for discordant findings, with marked variations in methodologies, including semiquantitative scoring, quan-
titative point counting of random fields, or whole-slide fibroblast focus quantification. To our knowledge, 
no previous study has systematically assessed variability of foci within tissue samples. Our data indicated 
that fibroblast focus profusion can vary markedly over a 1-mm depth of tissue; however, studies correlating 
profusion with mortality have typically reviewed one or two tissue sections per lobe sampled. Focus vari-
ability within tissue samples should therefore be considered in future studies correlating fibroblast focus 
profusion with clinical outcome. In support of the concept of fibroblast foci as a marker of disease activity 
was our finding of a possible association between 3D fibroblast focus density and FVC change. However, 
given our limited sample size larger studies would be required to confirm such an association.
Although significant progress has been made, our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment 
of IPF remains limited (6). Nintedanib and pirfenidone are two novel antifibrotic drugs that were recently 
shown to approximately halve the rate of decline of lung function in IPF (4, 5), with both having multiple 
actions on the proliferation and signaling pathways of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (31–34). Additional 
therapies are urgently required since these two drugs only reduce the rate of disease progression. This study 
emphasizes the importance of investigating new agents which prevent and/or ameliorate the repeated lung 
injuries that result in multifocal sites of fibroproliferation.
Initial work correlated micro-CT of whole paraffin-embedded samples of UIP tissue with histological 
sections. While soft tissue visualization through conventional X-ray–based CT is a challenge due to the low 
X-ray absorption of soft tissues, our micro-CT imaging protocol was optimized to provide the necessary 
image contrast between soft tissue and paraffin and also between different microarchitectural features within 
the tissue itself (24). Excellent microarchitectural feature correlation between histology and micro-CT imag-
ing was observed, and diagnostic structural features of a pattern of UIP were visualized. Whereas larger 
fibroblast foci were directly visible within micro-CT image data, typically those less than 200 μm were not. 
In the future, identification and segmentation of smaller fibroblast foci may be possible through improved 
contrast resolution, thresholding, and pattern recognition approaches. Automated approaches, based on 
exploiting the X-ray attenuation contrast window between tissue and paraffin mounting medium as well as 
between different tissue compartments may further facilitate subsequent visualization and quantification.
There are significant advantages to the use of paraffin-embedded tissue to study fibrotic ILDs. 
While images of paraffin-embedded tissue have a lower contrast than air-inflated, fixed, and dried tissue 
samples, access to sufficient fresh or frozen diagnostic tissue with robust histopathological integra-

tion poses significant challenges in fibrotic ILDs. The availability of large banks of archived diagnos-
tic paraffin-embedded samples facilitates systematic micro-CT analyses of fibrotic ILDs. Similarities 
and differences may further advance our understanding of underlying pathophysiology and potentially 
inform stratification approaches in fibrotic lung diseases. Given the diagnostic challenges that ILD his-
topathology poses, the ability to visualize in 3D could ultimately have diagnostic application. Further-
more, use of paraffin-embedded samples allows integration of coregistered histology sections within 
the 3D micro-CT volumetric data set; this enables accurate 3D analyses of the relationship of cellular 
and microarchitectural features of fibrotic lung diseases. While a predominantly manual segmentation 
methodology was applied during this initial study, development of automatic and semiautomatic meth-
odologies will further enable quantitative feature extraction and analyses such as 3D topographical 
distribution of lung fibrosis.
Our study has demonstrated that the application of 3D imaging methodologies can further advance 
concepts of disease pathogenesis in fibrotic lung diseases. It has indicated that fibroblast foci are hetero-
geneous and of varying size, complexity, and frequency in each patient’s biopsy, suggesting previously 
unrecognized plasticity. We have also shown that these fibroblast structures are independent of each other, 
consistent with their being the product of discrete sites of lung injury and repair.
Methods
Clinical material. Clinically indicated diagnostic surgical lung biopsy specimens from 4 patients (see Table 
2 for further clinical details) with a subsequent multidisciplinary diagnosis of IPF according to interna-
tional consensus guidelines were studied (1). No patient had clinical or radiological evidence of an acute 
exacerbation prior to or at the time of biopsy. Specimens had been diagnosed as showing a typical UIP 
pattern, confirmed by the independent review of two expert pulmonary pathologists. The samples had 
received standard processing with fixation in neutral buffered formalin for 48 hours and embedding in 
paraffin wax. Control formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded healthy lung tissue was from macroscopically 
normal lung sampled remote from the cancer site in two patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer.
Micro-CT imaging protocol. The paraffin-embedded lung samples were scanned using a custom-built 
Nikon Metrology micro-CT scanner at an isotropic voxel size of 8 μm as previously described (24), 
with optimization to maximize soft tissue contrast. An X-ray tube potential peak of 55 kVp was used 
at a beam current of 104 to 114 μA. 2,601 tomographic radiographic viewpoints of the samples were 
assessed (360° rotation in 0.14° steps) by acquiring 64 repeated projections (2,000 × 2,000 pixels) for 
each angular step to increase signal-to-noise ratio through frame averaging, where integration time for 
individual projections was set to 500 ms at an isotropic voxel size of 8 μm, resulting in a field of view 
of 16 × 16 mm2. Together with sample shuttling during acquisition to suppress ring artefacts with the 
reconstruction, the gross image acquisition time per sample was about 24 hours. The projections were 
then reconstructed in 3D using the Feldkamp, Davis, and Kress algorithm for cone beam tomography 
in the DigiR3D tomography reconstruction module of the DigiXCT software suite (Digisens) or using 
standard filtered-back projection within CTPro3D (v. XT 2.2 service pack 10, Nikon Metrology) and 
CTAgent (v. XT 2.2 service pack 10, Nikon Metrology) (35).
Histology acquisition. Following micro-CT imaging 4-μm-thick serial sections were cut over an approx-
imate depth of 1,000 μm. Sections every 8 μm (corresponding to the actual micro-CT voxel size of 8 μm) 
were deparaffinized and stained using modified Movat’s pentachrome or hematoxylin and eosin stain (36). 
Whole sections were imaged using a ×20 objective on a Dot-Slide scanning system (Olympus) and visual-
ized with Olyvia 2.6 (Olympus).
Micro-CT image visualization and correlation with histological sections. Image preprocessing, segmen-
tation, 3D volume reconstruction, and quantification of lung sample micro-CT data were performed 
with AvizoFire 7.1 (FEI). Three or more structural features in each micro-CT volume were matched 
to a specific histological section, and the 3D orientation of the micro-CT volume was correspondingly

for each photomicrograph. Scale bar: 500 μm. The 3D rendering of this fibroblast focus is visualized in Figure 4 and Supplemental Video 4.

transformed for plane correspondence between histological and micro-CT data. For direct compari-
sons of histological and micro-CT sections, the Fiji distribution of the ImageJ (version 1.49p) plugin 
Landmark Correspondences was used to coregister the images after the initial matching for plane 
correspondence (37, 38).
Micro-CT segmentation and analyses. Fibroblast foci were digitally labeled in the corresponding micro-
CT slice every 8 μm over 1,000 μm, using the segmentation editor, having been identified in the histolog-
ical sections as aggregates of spindle-shaped cells by a characteristic blue-green color from Movat’s pen-
tachrome stain or a pale color from hematoxylin and eosin stain; these stainings represent focal deposits 
of young, immature collagen and proteoglycans within the subepithelial interstitium. The contours of 
fibroblast foci within corresponding micro-CT slices were drawn using the “Lasso” function in AvizoFire. 
All foci within the micro-CT field of view were labeled. Missing levels (for example due to ribbon section 
breaks) were manually interpolated. Following tissue segmentation individual foci were then tagged by 
the labeling function, and individual foci were considered as separate structures if they had no common 
voxel faces, edges, or corners. The foci were then visualized through volume rendering using a cyclic color 
map so that foci in close proximity were more likely to be shown in a different color. Volume, 3D shape, 
and occurrence were quantified. For 3D volume renderings and calculation of lung tissue volume, paraffin 
was segmented from each micro-CT volumetric data set. Global thresholding was applied, followed by

scale value of a 1-mm3 volume of paraffin. An example of these steps is shown in Supplemental Figure 6. 
Using the “Crop” function of AvizoFire, the subvolume corresponding to the histological stack was then 
extracted, and lung tissue volume quantified.
Fibroblast focus quantitation and connectivity analyses. Connectivity between fibroblast foci was assessed 
visually through micro-CT 3-plane visualization, 3D foci segmentations, and corresponding sequential 2D 
histology section review. The total number of foci per case and fibroblast foci tissue density were calculated. 
Stereological analysis was performed, and fibroblast foci every 20 to 30 μm over approximately 1,000 μm 
were marked on photomicrographed whole-tissue sections using Olyvia. Fibroblast focus profusion was 
semiquantitatively (scale 0–6) or quantitatively (fibroblast foci per cm2 of tissue) measured on these sec-
tions. The Euler-Poincaré characteristic or Euler number (27, 39), a measure of redundancy in a network, 
was calculated. Full details are provided in the Supplemental Methods.
Statistics. All graphs were created using GraphPad Prism software, and statistical analyses were calcu-
lated using GraphPad Prism (version 6; GraphPad Software). The correlation between 1 year FVC percent-
age change and fibroblast focus density was determined by linear regression. A P value of less than 0.05 
was considered significant.

Committee (ref 07/H0607/73), and all subjects gave written informed consent.
