Abstract
Virtual reality (VR) distraction has become increasingly available in health care 
contexts and is used in acute pain management. However, there has been no 
systematic exploration of the importance of the content of VR environments. 
Two studies tested how interacting with nature VR influenced experienced 
and recollected pain after 1 week. Study 1 (n = 85) used a laboratory pain 
task (cold pressor), whereas Study 2 (n = 70) was a randomized controlled 
trial with patients undergoing dental treatment. In Study 1, nature (coastal) 
VR reduced both experienced and recollected pain compared with no VR. 
In Study 2, nature (coastal) VR reduced experienced and recalled pain in 
dental patients, compared with urban VR and standard care. Together, these 
data show that nature can improve experience of health care procedures 
through the use of VR, and that the content of the VR matters: Coastal 
nature is better than urban.

Not only are many medical procedures painful and anxiety provoking in 
patients (Sinatra, 2010), but these aversive experiences can undermine 
patients’ willingness to undergo or continue treatment (Redelmeier, Katz, & 
Kahneman, 2003). This phenomenon is of particular relevance in the context 
of dentistry. Some people avoid or delay dental care because they experience 
fear and anxiety (Chlan, Evans, Greenleaf, & Walker, 2000), and the expecta-
tion of pain has been identified as a major barrier to seeking dental care 
(Doerr, Lang, Nyquist, & Ronis, 1998). Despite advances in dental care, 
patients still rate dental treatment as painful (Tickle, Milsom, Crawford, & 
Aggarwal, 2012; Vassend, 1993), and dental anxiety is often related to the 
experience of pain (McNeil et al., 2011). It has been suggested that reducing 
the experience of pain and anxiety would lead to less unpleasant memories of 
the experience, and as a consequence increase the likelihood of future oral 
health care attendance (Tanja-Dijkstra et al., 2014a; Wilson, McNeil, Kyle, 
Weaver, & Graves, 2014).
A variety of distraction interventions, such as watching television, listen-
ing to music, and more recently the use of virtual reality (VR), are not only 
used in daily practice to help patients cope with unpleasant procedures in 
dentistry but also in other health care contexts (Hudson, Ogden, & Whiteley, 
2015; Mahrer & Gold, 2009). Distraction is thought to help patients cope 
with pain and other aversive experiences, and is often combined with relax-
ation or pleasant imagery (McCaul, Monson, & Maki, 1992). Due to recent 
technical advances, VR distraction has become increasingly available and is 
used in acute pain management (Garrett et al., 2014; Hoffman et al., 2006; 
Rutter, Dahlquist, & Weiss, 2009). Using VR has been shown to reduce pain 
during burn treatment (Guo, Deng, & Yang, 2015; Kipping, Rodger, Miller, 
& Kimble, 2012; Schmitt et al., 2011). More recently, in the context of dental 
care, one study demonstrated that distracting children with 3D video glasses 
during administration of local analgesia resulted in a reduction of anxiety 
(Nuvvula, Alahari, Kamatham, & Challa, 2015). In a simulated dental situa-
tion, VR distraction influenced the vividness of memories 1 week later for 
participants with higher levels of dental anxiety (Tanja-Dijkstra et al., 2014a). 
Despite these insights into the potential effectiveness of VR distraction in 
health care situations, to date there has been no systematic exploration of the 
importance of the content of VR environments on outcomes.
Some studies on the effectiveness of VR distraction as an analgesic have used 
natural environments, such as forests (Mühlberger, Wieser, Kenntner-Mabiala, 
 Tanja-Dijkstra et al. 
601
Pauli, & Wiederhold, 2007), snowy canyons (Hoffman et al., 2004; Schmitt et al., 
2011), or (in a dental context) a botanical garden (Furman et al., 2009). This 
choice of natural environments did not appear to be theoretically motivated even 
though there is a substantial body of work surrounding the health and well-being 
benefits of nature exposure more generally (Hartig, Mitchell, De Vries, & 
Frumkin, 2014).
Previous research demonstrated that natural environments can reduce 
feelings of stress and anxiety and improve mood compared with urban envi-
ronments (Hartig et al., 2014; McMahan & Estes, 2015), and coastal environ-
ments appear particularly beneficial (White, Alcock, Wheeler, & Depledge, 
2013). Most evidence relates to direct interactions with nature, but in practice 
access may be restricted, especially in potentially painful or anxiety-inducing 
health care contexts. A small but growing body of work has examined the 
possibility of introducing natural elements in health care settings, to reduce 
pain, stress, and anxiety. In a pioneering study, Ulrich (1984) was the first to 
provide evidence on the effects of a window view on trees (vs. brick wall) on 
the intake of pain medication and length of stay. More recent studies demon-
strated small stress-reducing effects of the use of indoor plants in a waiting 
room (Beukeboom, Langeveld, & Tanja-Dijkstra, 2012), and effects of dis-
traction with nature images and sounds on pain control during a medical pro-
cedure (Diette, Lechtzin, Haponik, Devrotes, & Rubin, 2003). While these 
studies tend to demonstrate small effect sizes, they offer indications of the 
potential benefits of nature-based interventions in health care. Combining 
nature stimuli with advances in VR technology avoids issues around real 
plants in health care settings (hygiene, care) and has not been studied 
systematically.
The present work integrates research exploring the analgesic properties of 
VR use and the use of nature interventions in health care contexts. Moreover, 
we examined recollections of pain a week later, in addition to experienced 
pain. Expectations of future experiences are heavily influenced by recollec-
tions (however accurate), rather than the actual original experiences (Kent, 
1985), and these recollections influence people’s willingness to return for 
further treatment (Redelmeier et al., 2003). Thus, designing an intervention 
that is able to reduce recollections of pain may be just as important as one that 
improves people’s current experiences.
Within the experience and memory of potentially painful treatment, 
mental images may be particularly important because they can motivate 
and trigger behavior. This image–behavior link has recently been dis-
cussed in different contexts using elaborated intrusion (EI) theory 
(Kavanagh, Andrade, & May, 2005). This theory originally described how 
images can motivate consumption behavior for food, drugs, and other 
 602 
Environment and Behavior 50(6)
pleasurable substances. It postulates the cognitive processes by which 
images translate into actions: First, pleasurable initial thoughts (about a 
desired food, for example) intrude into a person’s current activities. These 
are then elaborated using vivid sensory imagery, especially visual imagery 
and thus gain strength. The resulting positive associations and emotions 
then motivate consumption of unhealthy substances despite healthy inten-
tions. Boomsma, Pahl, and Andrade (2016) recently outlined the motiva-
tional role of mental images in proenvironmental behavior, describing how 
such images have the potential to translate abstract values into positive 
action through the same elaboration process. Despite very different con-
texts, this theoretical approach emphasizes the crucial role of mental imag-
ery in determining behavioral outcomes. This opens up an intriguing link 
to using VR technology. If VR could be used to disrupt the formation of 
negative mental images, this should lead to better treatment experiences 
and possibly even less remembered pain. Thus, the process could be highly 
relevant in the context of potentially painful health care treatments because 
elaborating threatening images is likely to undermine future attendance 
and contribute to negative health outcomes.
We already know that heightened emotion and arousal during an event 
increase the likelihood of recollections of the event being triggered by 
situational cues (Brewin, Dalgleish, & Joseph, 1996). For example, the 
smell of antiseptic might trigger aversive imagery of dental treatment. 
This cycle of intrusive recall and distressing imagery can be blocked by 
performing visuospatial tasks during exposure to aversive video material 
(Holmes & Bourne, 2008; Stuart, Holmes, & Brewin, 2006), so we pre-
dicted that exposure to virtual nature during painful or anxiety-provoking 
procedures would have a similar effect, reducing encoding of sensory 
information and thereby making the memory of the experience less vivid, 
less emotive, and less likely to be elaborated and influence decisions about 
future treatment.
We investigated these predictions in both a laboratory setting (Study 1) 
and in a real dental context, including treatments such as tooth extractions 
and fillings (Study 2, a randomized controlled trial). Our central hypothesis 
was that interacting with a VR coastal environment would reduce experi-
enced pain in the present, and lead to less recollected pain, and less vivid and 
intrusive recollections a week later. In Study 2, we added an explicit test of 
VR content. Here, we hypothesized that interacting with the VR coast would 
result in more positive outcomes than interacting with an urban VR setting. 
Support for this second hypothesis would suggest that any benefits are not 
merely due to the distraction potential of VR but also due to a function of the 
type of environment one encounters.

Study 1
Before undertaking a randomized controlled trial in a real health care context, 
we tested our VR approach in a controlled laboratory context. With VR tech-
nology, an advanced human–computer interface allows people to interact 
with and become immersed in a computer-generated environment (Riva & 
Gaggioli, 2008). This virtual environment provides visual information and 
can be manipulated actively with a controller such as a joystick (Dahlquist, 
Herbert, Weiss, & Jimeno, 2010). Discussions on the effectiveness of VR 
distraction have included the technical properties of the technical equipment 
being used (e.g., Hoffman et al., 2004) and the level of interactivity of the 
virtual environment (Dahlquist et al., 2007). There are some indications 
(Dahlquist et al., 2007) that being able to manipulate the virtual environment 
with a joystick (active use of the VR environment) is more beneficial than 
passively watching a virtual environment (passive use of the VR environ-
ment). However, many studies using 3D video glasses, thereby offering a 
situation of passive VR use, still demonstrate effects on anxiety (Nuvvula 
et al., 2015) or pain (Aminabadi, Erfanparast, Sohrabi, Oskouei, & Naghili, 
2012). We therefore choose to include both an active VR and a passive VR 
group in this study.
Method
We used the cold pressor task to create a painful experience (Von Baeyer, 
Piira, Chambers, Trapanotto, & Zeltzer, 2005) and included three conditions: 
(a) The simulated “standard care” involved participants wearing VR goggles 
that were switched off. There were two “treatment” conditions. (b) In the 
“active” VR condition, participants could explore the VR coastal environ-
ment themselves using a handset controller. (c) In the “passive” VR condi-
tion, participants watched a replay of a walk through the coastal environment. 
They were exposed to the same environment but had no control over the 
walk. We hypothesized that exposure to both the active/passive VR coast 
would be associated with lower experienced pain and recollected pain a week 
later than would standard care; both VR coast conditions would be associated 
with fewer negative intrusive thoughts and vivid negative images a week 
later.
Participants. A total of 85 participants (51 female; age M = 21.72, SD = 4.67) 
were recruited from a student participant pool and received course credits or 
£4 for their participation. A formal sample size calculation was not performed 
due to the novel character of the study, but the sample size was informed by 
 604 
Environment and Behavior 50(6)
previous cold pressor studies, which tend to include between 20 and 25 par-
ticipants per experimental condition (e.g., Dahlquist et al., 2010; Sil et al., 
2014). One participant was subsequently excluded from the analyses reported 
due to a research protocol violation (i.e., cold water temperature of 7.5 °C); 
including this participant does not change the pattern of results.
Materials. The VR environment consists of a coastal path, complete with sea 
views, a beach and field areas (see Figure 1; Depledge, Stone, & Bird, 2011). 
The VR environment was constructed using commercially sourced topo-
graphical geometry and aerial photographic images, and the resulting 3D 
model was used as a template to enable the virtual environment to be popu-
lated with additional 3D assets and photographic textures, including the accu-
rate representations of the few buildings at the site, trees, plants, and other 
features.
A Vuzix iWear VR920 headset was connected to an Alienware M11X lap-
top (dual core, 1.3 GHz Intel processor with Nvidia GT 540M graphics card) 
and used to display the virtual environment. Participants in the active condi-
tion were able to explore the virtual environment from a first-person perspec-
tive, by using a Zeemote JS1 Thumbstick Controller.
For the cold pressor task, we used a plastic tub with a pump to circulate the 
water and to ensure that the water would not warm up around the hand 
(Mitchell, MacDonald, & Brodie, 2004; see Figure 2 for the setup). The tem-
perature of the water was maintained at 7.0 °C (6.8-7.2°C was accepted).

This moderate temperature was chosen, so that we could ensure a reasonable 
time of VR exposure during the pain experience. Participants used their dom-
inant hand to hold the controller (in the active VR group) and their nondomi-
nant hand for the cold pressor task.
Procedure and measures. The study was approved by the ethics review board of 
the authors’ institution. Following consent procedures, participants were 
assigned to one of three conditions in a randomized between-participants design: 
(a) active VR, (b) passive VR, (c) standard care (no VR). While a baseline task 
is sometimes included in the standard cold pressor paradigm to control for indi-
vidual differences, we felt that this could be confusing to our participants when 
answering our recall questions. Thus, we omitted the baseline cold pressor task.
Participants first received instructions for the cold pressor task and the VR 
equipment. They were asked to abstain from analgesics (48 hr before), alco-
hol (12 hr), caffeine (2 hr), and nicotine (1 hr) use prior to participation. 
Participants were excluded from participation if they had any condition that 
would be exacerbated by or stop them from putting their hand in very cold 
water (e.g., poor circulation, arthritis, Raynaud’s disease). Due to the size of 
the VR headset, participants wearing glasses were also excluded.
Figure 2. The setup of the study.
 606 
Environment and Behavior 50(6)
To provide a common baseline, participants placed their nondominant 
hand in a warm water tank (37 °C) for 2 min at the start of the study (Von 
Baeyer et al., 2005). The VR was started and after 30 s, the experimenter 
placed the hand of the participant in the cold water (6.8-7.2 °C). Participants 
were instructed to remove their hand when the pain became unbearable, and 
they were unaware that an upper limit of 4 min was set for safety reasons. The 
number of seconds participants kept their hand in the water was recorded. 
After completing the cold pressor task, participants completed a computer-
ized questionnaire measuring the pain experience and stress. A follow-up 
phone call was scheduled 1 week after the lab session; participants were thus 
aware of the follow-up assessment but were not informed of the topics the 
follow-up interview would address. During this phone interview, participants 
were asked to rate recalled pain, vividness of their memories, and intrusive 
thoughts.
Pain experience was measured with an 11-point numeric rating scale 
(NRS), ranging from no pain at all (0) to pain as bad as it could be (10). 
Additionally, the short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ; 
Melzack, 1987) was used, which ranges from none (0) to severe (3); the aver-
age score on the 15 items was calculated (α = .80). The NRS is used in both 
research and clinical practice, and the SF-MPQ is a validated measure to 
assess pain (Breivik et al., 2008). The two measures were positively corre-
lated, r = .54.
At 1-week follow-up, remembered pain was assessed with the same 
11-point NRS used immediately after the cold pressor task. We developed a 
questionnaire in an 11-point NRS format that assessed intrusive thoughts of 
the experience (α = .71, three items) and vividness of memories of the experi-
ence (α = .83, four items). Mean scores were calculated for both constructs. 
Intrusive thoughts were measured with the following items: (a) How often 
have you thought about the visit to the lab in the past week? (b) To what 
extent did your thoughts about the visit pop into your mind spontaneously? 
(c) How hard were you trying not to think about the visit in the past week? 
Vividness of memories was measured with the following items: (a) How viv-
idly do you picture the visit? (b) How vividly do you feel the emotions you 
experienced? (c) How vividly do you remember the discomfort of holding 
your hand in the cold water? (d) How vividly do you remember the pain you 
experienced during the cold water task? (adapted from the Alcohol Craving 
Experience questionnaire, Statham et al., 2011).
Analysis strategy. The hypotheses were tested using a series of ordinary-least-
squares (OLS) regressions where the psychological variables (e.g., pain, viv-
idness) were the dependent variables, condition information was entered in 
 Tanja-Dijkstra et al. 
607
Block 1 to test the hypotheses, and age and gender variables were entered in 
Block 2. We used dummy coding for the condition variable to test the specific 
research questions. To test the effect of VR versus no VR, we coded the no 
VR conditions 0 and both active and passive VR 1. Next, to test if active 
engagement with VR was important, passive VR was coded 0 and active VR 
was coded 1.
Results
Pain. Across conditions, participants did not significantly differ in the length of 
time they kept their hands in the water: active VR (M = 165.66 s, SD = 83.59); 
passive VR (M = 165.00 s, SD = 94.72); controls (M = 134.41 s, SD = 95.15), 
F(2, 85) = 1.08, p = .344, see Table 1 for the means and standard deviations for 
the key variables in Study 1.
Participants in the VR conditions reported less experienced pain (single 
item) immediately after the cold pressor task than did control (see Table 2). 
Accounting for age and gender puts this effect below the threshold of statisti-
cal significance, although the effect size remained similar. There was no main 
effect of age, but females reported more pain than did males. In short, expo-
sure to the coastal VR reduced experienced pain by approximately 1 point on 
the 11-point scale. Similar results were obtained with the SF-MPQ, with 
exposure to VR reducing reported pain immediately after the cold pressor 
task, B = −.25 (SE = 0.10), β = −.25, p = .019. This effect remained significant 
after adding age and gender, B = −.24 (SE = 0.10), β = −.24, p = .024.
VR reduced the intensity of recalled pain (single-item NRS) at 1 week 
follow-up. Gender, but not age, was again significant, but the main effect of 
condition remained significant once these variables were added. The variance

explained by our models was greater for recalled pain than for experienced 
pain (R2 = .18).
Vivid memories and intrusive thoughts. There was, however, no support for the 
hypothesis that the VR experience would lead to less vivid memories than the 
control experience (B = −.50 [SE = 0.40], β = −.14, p = .208), or fewer intru-
sive thoughts during the week (B = −.16 [SE = 0.32], β = −.05, p = .624); 
results were unaffected by controlling for age and gender.
Active versus passive use of VR. Furthermore, there was no support for the 
hypothesis that active VR, compared with passive VR, would be associated 
with significantly less experienced pain (B = .22 [SE = 0.58], β = .05, p = 
.709) and recalled pain (B = .22 [SE = 0.54], β = .06, p = .684); results were 
not affected by controlling for age and gender.
Discussion
Supporting our primary hypotheses, using the coast VR resulted in lower pain 
immediately after the cold pressor task and at recall a week later, compared 
with “standard care.” However, we found no evidence for effects on vivid-
ness and intrusive thoughts predicted by EI theory. The mean scores on intru-
sive thoughts in particular were very low (see Table 1). This lack of findings 
is most likely due to the characteristics of the cold pressor task, being a non-
threatening and artificial situation that offers optimal situational control to 
the participant. So despite it being a very useful paradigm to study effects of 
pain, it appears to be less useful for testing predictions based on EI theory. We 
also found no evidence that active VR was better than passive VR, contrary 
to previous findings that showed that interactivity improved pain tolerance 
(Dahlquist et al., 2007).
Nevertheless, we felt that the support for our main hypotheses about pain 
was sufficient to take the study out of the lab and into the field, specifically 
into the context of patients experiencing dental treatment. Some changes 
were made to the design. In particular, rather than having a passive VR condi-
tion, we substituted this for an alternative active urban VR environment. An 
urban environment was chosen as in theory this should be equally as distract-
ing but less psychologically “restorative” than a natural environment such as 
the coast (Hartig, Böök, Garvill, Olsson, & Gärling, 1996; Hartig et al., 
2014). Individuals vary in dental anxiety (which is related to treatment out-
comes), so a measure of this was also included. We only included the one-
item measure of pain not the SF-MPQ, because time was severely restricted 
in this field study.

Study 2
Rationale for Study 2
Study 2 investigated similar outcomes of experienced and recollected pain but 
in the health care context of dental treatment. This time, real patients volun-
teered to take part in the research, and either received standard care or engaged 
with either the coastal VR or an urban VR setting during their treatment. Note 
that during routine dental treatment, additional pain management is provided 
through provision of local anesthetics. As in Study 1, we hypothesized that 
experienced and recollected pain would be lower in the VR coast than stan-
dard care condition. In addition, given prior evidence of the importance of 
nature (Hartig et al., 2014), we predicted that experienced and recalled pain 
would be lower in the VR coast than in the urban VR condition. This mecha-
nism would be further supported if we found that the coast VR was perceived 
as more restorative than the urban VR. Finally, we again tested the two mecha-
nisms underpinning any differences in recalled pain as proposed by EI theory, 
and predicted that the coast VR would be associated with the fewest negative 
intrusive thoughts and images of the three conditions. Despite failure to sup-
port these findings in Study 1, we reasoned that given that the theory and 
measures were developed in applied health psychology contexts, they might 
be more applicable and sensitive in the current field trial.
The study was approved by a medical ethics committee in the United 
Kingdom. A complete description of the study protocol is published else-
where (Tanja-Dijkstra et al., 2014b).
Method
Participants. Of the 87 patients who consented to participate, two withdrew 
their consent and five did not return for treatment. Of the 80 randomized 
patients, five participants were unable to continue in the VR condition due to 
technical issues, and another four patients requested to stop the VR, one 
patient had to be excluded, as that individual was below 18 years of age. A 
total of 70 patients were thus included in the analysis, with 11 of these drop-
ping out at 1-week follow-up (see Online Appendix for flow chart and Table 
3 for baseline characteristics of the participants). Preliminary statistical 
checks confirmed that the three groups did not differ on any of the character-
istics listed in Table 3 (all F < 1, all χ2 p > .33). Details about the dental treat-
ment were recorded by the dentist.
Data from our own pilot work in a simulated dental setting (Tanja-Dijkstra 
et al., 2014a) were used in the sample size calculation. This calculation (with a 
power of 0.80, significance level of .05 and based on two-sided testing) is based 
 Tanja-Dijkstra et al. 
611
on one of the main outcomes related to memories, “intrusive thoughts,” as mea-
sured with an 11-point NRS. A total sample size of 90 patients (i.e., 30 per 
group) would allow the detection of a between-group difference of around 0.82 
units (i.e., a moderate effect size, see for details, Tanja-Dijkstra et al., 2014b).
Materials. Two VR environments were used in the study: the coast VR from 
Study 1, extended considerably to provide navigation options for up to 30 
min, and an urban environment (Figure 3). The urban environment was 
developed specifically for this study, taking a conservative approach by 
including some natural elements (e.g., trees, a fountain) and making this 
environment look well maintained and pleasant. A Sony personal 3D viewer 
headset (Figure 4) was connected to an Alienware gaming laptop and used to

with a maximum anticipated appointment duration of 30 min. Both patients 
who needed relative analgesia (RA), which is a pharmacologically induced 
form of conscious sedation, and those treated without sedation were included. 
For both groups, the dentist provided local anesthetics to provide significant 
management of pain (unlike the laboratory setting in which no supplemen-
tary pain control was provided). Patients were randomized into three groups: 
(a) standard care + coast VR, (b) standard care + urban VR, and (c) standard 
care control group. Randomization was done prior to the study using a com-
puterized stratified block design Two strata were used: (a) by sedation (RA: 
yes or no) and (b) by dentist who performed the treatment (Dentist 1 or Den-
tist 2). Randomization was concealed via sequentially numbered opaque 
sealed envelopes, and was revealed by the dentist or nurse who started the 
VR, immediately prior to commencing treatment. At that point, staff were no 
longer blinded for condition.
Dental anxiety was measured at baseline, using the Modified Dental 
Anxiety Scale (MDAS), which consists of five items (Humphris, Morrison, 
& Lindsay, 1995). A total score was calculated by summing up the scores of 
the five items, with totals ranging from 5 to 25. The baseline questionnaire 
was completed on average 4 weeks before treatment. Immediately after treat-
ment, measures regarding the experience of the dental treatment (e.g., expe-
rienced pain and stress) and the VR experience (e.g., evaluation of the VR 
environments) were collected using a paper-based questionnaire. Experienced 
pain was measured using the same 11-point NRS as used in Study 1; stress 
was measured using a self-reported measure consisting of five items on a 
5-point scale from the tension dimension from the Profile of Mood States, α 
= .95 (McNair, Lorr, & Droppleman, 1971). The questions about the VR 
experience were only asked to patients in the two VR groups. Presence was 
measured with six items on 11-point NRSs based on the IGroup Presence 
Questionnaire (Schubert, Friedmann, & Regenbrecht, 2001) and the Reality 
Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (Baños et al., 2000; α = .87). Research 
showed that the VR technology used can influence levels of presence and the 
analgesic effects of VR use (Hoffman et al., 2004), and it is therefore impor-
tant to ensure a similar level of presence in both VR environments. 
Attractiveness of the VR environments was measured with five items on a 
5-point Bipolar Adjective scale (Lohr & Pearson-Mims, 2000; α = .69). 
Perceived restoration was measured with eight items on a 5-point scale 
(Hartig, Korpela, Evans, & Gärling, 1997; α = .80). Based on the general 
notion within the literature on restorative environments that natural environ-
ments are rated as more attractive and associated with a higher level of per-
ceived restorativeness, we included these measures to underline this basic 
difference between the two VR environments used in our study.
 614 
Environment and Behavior 50(6)
Patients were contacted after 1 week and completed a telephone-based 
questionnaire assessing measures related to memories of the experience. 
Recalled pain was measured with the same 11-point NRS as Study 1. 
Vividness of memories (five items, α = .74) items was adapted from Study 1 
to fit the clinical, dental context of this study and measured with the follow-
ing items: (a) How vividly do you picture the visit? (b) How vividly do you 
feel the emotions you experienced? (c) How vividly do you remember the 
discomfort of holding your mouth open? (d) How vividly do you remember 
the sounds of the dental instruments? (e) How vividly do you remember the 
smell in the dental practice? The intrusive thoughts measure (three items, α = 
.82) was identical to Study 1.
The study was conducted between August 2013 and October 2014 at a 
dental practice in the United Kingdom. Two dentists were involved in the 
study planning, but circumstances meant that one was only able to treat one 
patient. The other dentist thus treated more patients than initially planned but 
reached her maximum capacity before we reached the targeted number. We 
therefore terminated the study at this point, with 87 patients consented.
Analysis strategy. As with Study 1, we used OLS regressions with condition 
entered in Block 1, adding potential covariates to Block 2. Block 2 variables 
were more important here because they included uncontrollable differences 
in treatment across conditions such as type and duration of treatment, as well 
as trait Dental Anxiety. Treatment type was coded as follows: 0 = filling, 1 = 
extraction or extraction + filling. There were no significant differences in 
these variables as a function of condition. To recap, unlike Study 1, where 
both VR conditions were of the same coastal environment, and people inter-
acted with them differently, Study 2 had two different VR environments, and 
thus we did not collapse across VR conditions here. Instead, two dummy 
variables for condition were created: coast = 1, else 0; and urban = 1, else 0. 
This enabled us to directly compare both conditions simultaneously with 
standard care as the reference category. In a second step, we tested the direct 
comparison of the two VR environments to provide further evidence that the 
content of the VR environment matters.
Results
Pain. Engaging with the coast VR was associated with significantly less 
experienced pain than standard care (see Table 4). This effect remained sig-
nificant after controlling for age, gender, dental anxiety, type and duration of 
treatment. By contrast, there was no difference in experienced pain between 
the urban VR and standard care, either before or after controls were added.

Environment and Behavior 50(6)
None of the control variables were significantly associated with experienced 
pain in their own right. These effects were maintained 1 week later (Table 3). 
Specifically, recalled pain was lower in the coast VR than in standard care 
group, but there was again no difference between the urban VR and standard 
care; effects remained when controls were added.
The different findings for coast versus urban VR compared with standard care 
are not an artifact of our statistical approach. Regressions comparing the two VR 
conditions directly (excluding standard care) found that coast VR participants 
reported significantly lower experienced pain (B = −1.41 [SE = 0.63], β = −.34, p 
= .031). The difference between coast and urban VR for recalled pain was below 
the conventional threshold for statistical significance but had a similar effect size; 
it is likely that the suboptimal sample size played a role here (B = −1.28 [SE = 
0.64], β = −.32, p = .055); this did not change when controls were added. This is 
further supported by results on stress, which showed that while the coast VR 
group reported significantly lower stress scores than standard care (B = −.81 [SE 
= 0.35], β = −.31, p = .025), the urban VR group did not (B = −.45 [SE = 0.34], β 
= −.18, p = .189); this did not change when controls were added. Table 5 presents 
the means and standard deviations for the key variables in Study 2.
Vividness of memories and intrusive thoughts. As with Study 1, however, there 
was no indication that memory vividness or intrusive thoughts accounted for 
any effect on recollected pain. Specifically, reports of vividness at follow-up 
were not significantly different, compared with standard care, for either the 
coast VR (B = −.74 [SE = 0.60], β = −.19, p = .220) or urban VR (B = −.28 
[SE = 0.59], β = −.06, p = .675). Findings for intrusive thoughts were simi-
larly nonsignificant: coast VR (B = .39 [SE = 0.80], β = .08, p = .625); urban 
VR (B = −.26 [SE = 0.79], β = −.05, p = .740).

(coast M = 3.40, SD = 0.75; urban M = 2.86, SD = 0.61), F(1, 37) = 6.18, p =

(coast M = 5.31, SD = 2.04; urban M = 4.60, SD = 2.42), F < 1.
Discussion
Supporting our central hypotheses, and replicating and extending the results 
of Study 1, Study 2 showed that the beneficial effects of VR held for a sample 
of real dental patients who experienced treatments such as extractions and 
fillings. Most importantly, the findings only held for our natural, coastal, VR, 
and were not replicated by our newly included urban VR. If the effect were 
solely due to distraction, the content of the VR should not matter (as long as 
the user has a similar array of stimuli and size of VR, and interacts with it in 
the same way—which was the case here). Replicating Study 1, however, we 
again found no support for the processes proposed by EI theory to account for 
why recalled pain might be lower in the coast VR condition. We recognize, 
however, that our sample size calculation was based on this variable and as, 
due to reasons beyond our control, the desired sample size was not achieved, 
there may be insufficient power to demonstrate significant differences in this 
variable in the current study.
General Discussion
Although the literature on nature benefits in general is flourishing, much less 
research has focused on exploring these benefits in the context of health care. 
Two studies, an experimental laboratory study and a randomized controlled 
trial, showed that a virtual coastal environment reduced experienced pain 
reported immediately after an aversive experience, and recalled pain 1 week 
after the experience. The findings replicated across both a student sample 
asked to hold a hand in cold water and a sample of dental patients undergoing 
treatment. This consistency is found even though the dental patients in Study 
2 received standard pain control in the form of local anesthetics; no such pain 
control was available to the participants in Study 1. While some previous 
research has shown that VR distraction can lower pain (Guo et al., 2015; Sil 
et al., 2014), the content of the VR has been neglected. Especially in Study 2, 
we showed that the pain reduction was only found for a restorative coastal 
environment but not for a built urban environment, even though we included 
natural elements in the city to provide a conservative test. The latter finding 
speaks against a mere distraction effect, because if it were distraction both 
VR environments should have had similar effects. It thus appears that 
 618 
Environment and Behavior 50(6)
particular VR environments could provide greater benefits for patients’ pain 
experiences. Future research should focus on unraveling the exact mecha-
nisms that can explain these effects by systematically varying the (natural) 
content of the VR environments.
Previous work has studied the influence of the environmental context on 
patient health and well-being in general (Dijkstra, Pieterse, & Pruyn, 2006; 
Joseph, Choi, & Quan, 2015), and on pain in particular (Malenbaum, Keefe, 
Williams, Ulrich, & Somers, 2008). Both nature and VR have been identified 
as promising approaches to improve the experience of patients undergoing 
medical treatment but had not previously been combined in a systematic 
fashion. Our findings are in line with literature, showing that contact with 
nature, even indirect contact through windows (Ulrich, 1984), can influence 
physical and mental well-being (Hartig et al., 2014). More importantly they 
address a key restriction of using nature in health care, namely that access is 
restricted, especially in potentially painful or anxiety-inducing health care 
contexts. Using VR technology has several advantages over other ways in 
which nature had previously been introduced into health care settings: (a) It 
has fewer hygiene-related issues than real plants; (b) it can be used even 
when lying back and undergoing specific treatments; (c) the patient has con-
trol over the experience, navigating through a virtual environment, in a con-
text typically characterized by low control; and (d) it excludes potentially 
aversive visual cues. Our research suggests that VR technology has patient 
benefits in situations where real exposure to nature is unfeasible. Specifically, 
it supports the notion that nature can be applied to manage acute pain in 
patients, and VR provides an opportunity to do so in the absence of real views 
or experiences.
With the growing use of VR as a distraction intervention in health care 
settings, it is important to address the question, to what extent VR inter-
ventions are more or less successful in helping patients cope with proce-
dural pain than other types of distraction interventions. In general, effects 
of VR distraction on pain, compared with control conditions, are large (see 
for a review, Kenney & Milling, 2016). There are a few studies in which 
other distraction interventions were used and compared with VR distrac-
tion. For example, Kipping and colleagues (2012) demonstrated that VR 
distraction resulted in less pain medication use, compared with standard 
distraction such as watching television, music, or stories. However, results 
on all other pain measures were nonsignificant. To get a full understanding 
of the potential analgesic effects of VR compared with other distraction 
techniques or pharmacological pain management, direct comparisons are 
needed in future studies, and a systematic assessment of existing studies 
should be undertaken.

In a novel application of a cognitive psychology approach, we 
explored the role of vividness and intrusive thoughts to learn about the 
memory process during painful experiences. However, we found no evi-
dence that VR reduced the vividness and intrusiveness of memories as 
argued by the EI theory (Kavanagh et al., 2005). For Study 1, this could 
be explained by the highly artificial nature of the overall experience. 
While using an experimental paradigm to induce pain is very suitable for 
the purpose of scientific research, this specific paradigm may not have 
strong enough effects on participants’ daily life to trigger intrusive mem-
ories. However, Study 2 did not support our hypothesis either. It could be 
argued that this is due to relatively low pain during dental treatment as 
dentists use local anesthetics to control pain. In contrast, VR distraction 
is often used for burn-injured patients for whom pharmacologic analge-
sics need to be complemented by nonpharmacologic techniques due to 
the high levels of pain they experience (Sharar et al., 2014). Testing EI 
theory in the context of burn treatment could be worth pursuing as treat-
ment for burn-injured patients has a strong repeating character and influ-
encing memories of the treatment could provide benefits for those 
patients. Nevertheless, in the current dental context we were able to 
influence the recollections of pain, which is important, given that expec-
tations of future experiences are heavily influenced by recollections 
(however inaccurate) of the original experiences (Kent, 1985). A recent 
study demonstrated this key role of recollections of experiences, show-
ing that recollections of past dental appointments influence behavioral 
intentions to attend future appointments (Schneider, Andrade, Tanja-
Dijkstra, White, & Moles, 2016).
Taken together, our research supports the previous positive findings of 
VR distraction in acute pain management, and suggests that VR nature can 
be used in combination with traditional analgesics. Previous research dem-
onstrated that the quality of the VR equipment is of importance in the effec-
tiveness of the pain reduction properties of the technique (Hoffman et al., 
2006). Our results demonstrate that the content of the VR is pivotal: A vir-
tual walk along a coastline was most beneficial in reducing experienced and 
recollected pain. With the fast growing technological possibilities, this 
research points to the need to carefully consider VR content and existing 
theories of nature and well-being when applying VR distraction in clinical 
pain management.
