Abstract
Background—Two large-scale prostate cancer screening trials with prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) have given conflicting results in terms of the efficacy of such screening. One of those trials, 
the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, previously reported 
outcomes through 13 years of follow-up. Here we present updated findings from PLCO.
Methods—PLCO randomized subjects from 1993–2001 to an intervention or control arm. 
Intervention arm men received annual PSA tests for six years and digital rectal exam for four 
years. We used linkage with the National Death Index (NDI) to extend mortality follow-up to a 
maximum of 19 years from randomization.
Results—38,340 and 38,343 men were randomized to the intervention and control arms, 
respectively. Median (25th/75th) follow-up time was 14.8 years (12.7/16.5) in the intervention and 
14.7 years (12.6/16.4) in the control arm. 255 (intervention arm) versus 244 (control arm) deaths 
from prostate cancer were observed, for a rate-ratio (RR) of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.87–1.24). The RR for 
all-cause mortality was 0.977 (95% CI: 0.950,1.004). An estimated 86% of control versus 99% of 
intervention arm men received any PSA testing during the trial, with estimated yearly screening 
phase PSA testing rates of 46% (control) versus 84% (intervention).
Conclusion—Extended follow-up of PLCO over a median of 15 years continues to indicate no 
reduction in prostate cancer mortality for the intervention compared to control arms. Due to the 
high rate of control arm PSA testing, this finding can be viewed as showing no benefit of 
organized over opportunistic screening.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in U.S. men1. In addition to 
improvements in treatment and efforts at primary prevention of prostate cancer, another 
potential tool to reduce the burden of prostate cancer mortality is early detection. Although 
screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) had been ongoing for over 
25 years, it is still not clear whether such screening reduces prostate cancer mortality, and if 
so, whether the benefits outweigh the established harms2,3. Due to its frequently indolent 
nature, and the difficulty in distinguishing indolent from potentially fatal prostate cancer, the 
harms of prostate cancer screening in the form of overdiagnosed and overtreated cases are 
considerable, as are the financial and medical resource costs. As such, prostate cancer 
screening has a high bar in terms of the magnitude of mortality reduction required to make 
screening worthwhile.
This uncertainty about the utility of prostate cancer screening persists even as two large-
scale randomized trials of prostate cancer screening have reported their findings. The most 
recent analysis reported from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate 
Cancer (ERSPC), with follow-up through 13 years, showed a prostate cancer mortality rate 
ratio (RR) of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.69–0.91); a prior analysis through a median of 11 years 
follow-up showed similar findings (RR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.68–0.91)4,5. In contrast, the 
Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial did not show any 
difference between screening and usual care; through up to 13 years of follow-up the 
prostate cancer mortality RR was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.87–1.36)6.
The conflicting results of the trials, and the fact that, even accepting the rate ratio reported 
from the ERSPC, it is not clear whether the harms of screening outweigh the benefits, led 
the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to give prostate cancer screening a D 
recommendation, i.e., recommend against screening, for the general U.S. population3.
In the current analysis, we update the mortality results of the PLCO trial, with follow-up 
extended to up to 19 years from randomization. In addition to providing a more stable 
estimate of the risk ratio based on more prostate cancer deaths, this updated analysis will 
also allow for examination of the longer-term effects of prostate cancer screening, which is 
especially relevant given the natural history of the disease.
Methods
The design and methods of the PLCO Trial have been described6,7. Briefly, randomization at 
ten U.S. screening centers of subjects age 55–74 to either an intervention or control arm 
occurred from 1993–2001. The primary exclusion criteria were a history of a PLCO cancer, 
current cancer treatment, and beginning in 1995, having had more than one PSA blood test

 in the prior three years. At study entry, participants completed a self-administered baseline 
questionnaire that included demographics, general risk factors, and screening and medical 
histories.
Screening Examinations
Men in the intervention arm received a PSA blood test and DRE at baseline (T0), an annual 
DRE for three more years (T1–T3) and, generally, an annual PSA for five more years (T1–
T5). Men randomized prior to May, 1994, only received PSA for T1–T3 and those 
randomized from June 1994 to May 1995 received PSA only at T1–T3 and T5. Participants 
also received chest radiographs annually for four years and flexible sigmoidoscopy at 
baseline and year three or five. PSA results were classified as abnormal if they were greater 
than 4 ng/m. DRE results were considered abnormal if there was nodularity or induration of 
the prostate, or if the examiner judged other criteria to be suspicious for cancer, including 
asymmetry.
Participants and their physicians were notified in writing of any suspicious abnormality on 
screening. The diagnostic process following a positive screen was managed by participants’ 
primary care physicians, and was not dictated by the trial.
Ascertainment of Study End-points
The primary trial endpoint for the prostate component of PLCO was prostate cancer-specific 
mortality; secondary endpoints included prostate cancer incidence, cancer stage and Gleason 
grade, survival, harms of screening, contamination and compliance, and all-cause mortality.
The original analysis period for the PLCO prostate component was from randomization 
through 13 years of follow-up or December 31st, 2009, whichever came first6. Trial 
endpoints for this period have been described in previous publications. For this original 
period, incident cancers and deaths were primarily ascertained through a mailed annual 
study update questionnaire (ASU). Incident cancers reported on the ASU were verified by 
obtaining medical records and utilizing a standardized abstracting process. Next of kin 
notified the trial of deaths, which were verified by obtaining death certificates; National 
Death Index (NDI) searches were also used. The underlying cause of death was determined 
in a uniform and unbiased manner from medical records and the death certificate using a 
blinded endpoint verification process conducted by an independent death review 
committee8.
As has been previously described, going forward from the original analysis period, a 
structural change in the operation of PLCO affected the way cancer incidence and mortality 
endpoints were ascertained9. Briefly, beginning in mid-2011, PLCO subjects were re-
consented with 3 possible options: active follow-up through a central coordinating center, 
passive follow-up implemented at the screening centers, and refusal of further follow-up. 
Active participants were eligible for linkages to NDI and state cancer registries and also 
could be contacted directly to fill out questionnaires or for future specimen collections. 
Passive participants did not have their personally identifiable information (PII) transferred to 
the central coordinating center but could still be passively followed through NDI and state 
cancer registries by their local screening centers; those deceased at the time of re-consent

 were considered passive participants. Finally, refusers had no further active or passive 
follow-up.
All active and passive subjects were linked to the NDI, with complete death information 
through the end of 2012. For these subjects, the end-of-follow-up for mortality for this 
analysis was December 31st, 2012 or date of death, whichever came first. For refusers, 
because they had to actively refuse and thus were known to be alive at their refusal date 
(which ranged from mid-2011 until mid-2012 at nine centers and 2014 at one center), their 
end of follow-up was their refusal date or December 31, 2012, whichever came first.
For the extended analysis, the trial ascertained deaths primarily through the NDI, so medical 
records were not available to perform endpoint verification. Therefore, for deaths occurring 
after the original cutoff (Dec 31st, 2009), the underlying cause of death from the NDI was 
used to determine whether deaths were from prostate cancer or not; for deaths before that 
date, the endpoint-verified classifications used in the original report were also used here. 
Alternative analyses were performed to assess the effect of using only death certificate (or 
NDI) information instead of the endpoint-verified classifications for the originally reported 
deaths. In computing all-cause mortality, deaths from lung and colorectal cancer were 
excluded because trial participants were screened for those cancers and extended mortality 
follow-up for them is ongoing.
Only mortality outcomes are reported on here. Linkage with cancer registries to ascertain 
incident prostate cancers is ongoing, so complete incidence data for the period after Dec31st, 
2009 are not currently available. For those prostate cancers reported from the original 
analysis period, 4250 in the intervention and 3815 in the control arm, we computed the 
proportion of total prostate cancer deaths in the extended analysis that derived from these 
cases6.
A secondary trial endpoint was assessing non-protocol use of PLCO screening tests. Use of 
PSA testing outside of the trial protocol was assessed through periodic surveys of a sample 
of trial participants. Surveys were performed for study years 0–5 in the control arm only and 
study years 6–17 in both arms. The survey consisted of a self-administered health status 
questionnaire (HSQ) that inquired about the use of various preventative health procedures, 
including the PLCO screening tests. For the control arm, the survey asked whether the 
respondent ever had the test in question, and if so, when the most recent test was (within the 
past year, 1–2 years ago, 2–3 years ago, more than 3 years ago), and the reason for the most 
recent test (“because of a specific health problem”, “follow-up of a previous health problem” 
and “as part of a routine health check-up”). For the intervention arm, the survey asked 
whether the respondent ever had the test in question since the date of their last PLCO screen 
with that test, with the follow-up questions (timing and reason) referring only to tests after 
that date. The surveys were customized so that a subject’s actual last PLCO screening dates 
were pre-written on the form; if they had no PLCO screens then the phrase “since their last 
PLCO screen” was omitted.

 Statistical Methods
Mortality rates from prostate cancer were defined as deaths from prostate cancer during the 
follow-up period divided by the person years (PY) of follow-up. The rate-ratio (RR) of the 
intervention to control arm was computed as the ratio of the rates in the two arms. The 95% 
confidence interval for the RR was calculated assuming a Poisson distribution of events and 
using the profile likelihood method; p-values were computed based on the normal 
approximation to the Poisson10. We also utilized Cox proportional hazards regression to 
estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for prostate cancer death associated with being randomized to 
the intervention as compared to control arm; subjects not known to have died of prostate 
cancer were censored at the end of their follow-up11.
For various study periods, we computed HSQ survey rates for having PSA tests in the past 
year for screening, PSA tests in the past year for any reason, PSA tests in the past 3 years for 
any reason and PSA tests ever for any reason. Note it was not possible to estimate the 
proportion ever receiving a PSA test for screening because the reason for testing question 
only related to subjects’ most recent test. For the intervention arm, since the survey 
questions only referred to tests taken after the last PLCO protocol test, the computed rates 
were adjusted to account for PLCO protocol PSA tests taken within the relevant time period 
(for PSA tests in the past 3 years) or at any time (for PSA tests ever). Also, as noted 
previously, for the screening period the survey excluded so-called “baseline contaminated 
subjects”, i.e., those who responded on the baseline questionnaire as having received 2 or 
more PSA tests in the prior 3 years. These were previously assumed, in calculating 
contamination rates, to have had screening PSA tests every year during the screening phase. 
A similar adjustment was performed here, so the displayed rate reflects a weighted average 
of the survey rates for those without baseline contamination (90%) and the assumed rates for 
those with baseline contamination.
Results
A total of 38,340 and 38,343 men were randomized to the intervention and control arms, 
respectively. The demographics and medical history of subjects were similar across arms 
(Table 1). A total of 88.5% were non-Hispanic white and 35% were age 65 or over at 
randomization.
With respect to transfer status to centralized follow-up, the proportion of refusers was 8.4% 
in the intervention versus 11.3% in the usual care arm (p <0.001). Median follow-up time 
was similar for refusers (14.9 years intervention and 14.8 years control) and active/passive 
participants (median 14.8 years intervention and 14.7 years usual care); note that by 
definition refusers had to survive at least until the transition time to centralized follow-up 
whereas passive participants could have died earlier. Overall, follow-up time was a median 
(25th/75th) of 14.8 years (12.7/16.5) in the intervention arm versus 14.7 years (12.6/16.4) in 
the control arm. The maximum follow-up was 19.1 years in each arm.
Prostate cancer deaths by arm are shown in Table 2. A total of 255 prostate cancer deaths 
(rate 47.8 per 100,000 PY) were observed in the intervention versus 244 (rate 46.0 per

 100,000 PY) in the control arm. The rate ratio (RR) was 1.04 in favor of the control arm 
(95% CI: 0.87–1.24). Proportional hazards modeling shows that the HR was essentially 
identical to the RR, with similar confidence interval and p-value (Table 2). Figure 1 displays 
cumulative prostate cancer deaths by study time. RRs and HRs varied little by cumulative 
study time period. RRs were 1.07 (95% CI: 0.78–1.48), 0.99 (95% CI: 0.77–1.29) and 1.00 
(95% CI: 0.81–1.25) for study periods 0–8 years, 0–10 years, and 0–12 years, respectively; 
HRs were similar (Table 2).
For the newly determined deaths (occurring after December 31, 2009), endpoint verification 
was not performed due to lack of medical records collected. We examined the potential 
impact of this by re-performing the analysis using only death certificate or NDI underlying 
cause data for all deaths. The RR increased slightly to 1.06 (95% CI: 0.89–1.26) and the HR 
increased slightly to 1.05 in favor of the control arm (95% CI:0.88 – 1.26).
The previously reported analysis of cases occurring through the end of 2009 and within 13 
years of randomization, for which median follow-up for the cohort was 11.9 years, showed a 
total of 4250 intervention and 3815 control arm prostate cancer cases. Of these, 2539 (60%) 
intervention arm and 1996 (52%) control arm cases were diagnosed during the screening 
phase (first 6 trial years); the incidence RR during the screening phase was 1.27 (95% CI: 
1.20–1.35). Of the currently reported 255 intervention arm prostate cancer deaths, 88.6% 
came from these previously reported 4250 cases and 61.6% came from the 2539 screening 
phase cases. Comparable figures for the control arm (244 currently reported prostate cancer 
deaths) were 88.9% and 58.6%.
All-cause mortality rates were 1728 and 1769 (per 100,000 PY) in the intervention and 
control arms, respectively (Table 2). The HR was 0.973 (95% CI: 0.945–1.001), which was 
borderline statistically significant in favor of the intervention arm (p=0.06); the RR was 
similar (RR=0.977; 95% CI: 0.950–1.004), although the p-value was slightly higher 
(p=0.11). Table 3 shows the distribution of all-cause mortality. The proportions from the 
various causes of deaths were generally similar across arms.
Table 4 shows the results of the HSQ surveys on non-protocol PSA testing. For the entire 
post-screening period, rates were similar across arms for testing within the past year, both 
for screening (45.0% and 45.9% for intervention and control arm, respectively) and for any 
reason (52.5% and 54.6% for the intervention and control arm, respectively). These rates 
varied little over study time periods in the post-screening phase (table 4). These 
corresponding rates during the screening phase in the control arm were slightly lower 
(40.1% and 47.3% for screening and testing for any reason, respectively). Ever PSA testing 
rates during the post-screening phase were 99% for the intervention arm and 86% for the 
control arm.
In the intervention arm, compliance rates for PSA screening were 89.4%, 87.2%, 86.4%, 
85.1%, 78.4% and 78.3% for study years 0–5 (average, 84.1%). By protocol, 80.0% of 
intervention arm men were scheduled to receive all 6 PSA tests, 16.4% were scheduled to 
receive 5 PSA tests and 3.6% were scheduled to receive 4 PSA tests, based on their

 randomization date. A total of 93.6% of intervention arm men received at least one protocol 
PSA screen.
Discussion
In this extended follow-up of the prostate component of the PLCO trial, median follow-up 
increased by about three years, maximum follow-up increased by six years, and prostate 
cancer deaths increased by 65% from the prior analysis. The risk ratio (intervention arm 
compared to usual care) for prostate cancer mortality remained slightly above one, with a 
value of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.87–1.24), down from 1.09 in the prior analysis (the lower 95% 
confidence limit remained unchanged at 0.87).
With a median follow-up of almost 15 years, the majority of deaths from prostate cancer 
(around 60% in each arm) still occurred in cases diagnosed during the screening phase of the 
trial (first 6 years). This indicates the need for long-term follow-up, perhaps even longer than 
15 years, to fully capture the potential mortality effects of PSA screening.
As with any null trial, statistical power is a critical issue. The original power analysis 
performed near the start of the trial showed a 90% power for a 20% mortality reduction 
across arms12. This power value was based on estimated event rates (for control arm prostate 
cancer deaths), predicted compliance and contamination rates, and an estimated “true” 
mortality effect of screening with perfect compliance and no contamination. A revised 
analysis, based in part on longer follow-up (13 years instead of 10) showed similar 90% 
power assuming a 38% contamination rate (specifically, 38% of control arm men received 
yearly screening) and 90% compliance (averaged over screening rounds) and the same true 
mortality effect (of 27%)13. A common critique of the PLCO prostate trial has been that the 
original (and revised) power estimate was too high, based both on higher levels of 
contamination and lower numbers of events than predicted. With extended follow-up and 
about 65% more prostate cancer deaths in the current analysis, the second factor has been 
mitigated to some extent.
With respect to contamination, using the original trial definition (screening PSA test in the 
past year), the rate reported here of 46% in the screening phase is only modestly higher than 
the above 38%. However, the effect on power of non-yearly testing during the screening 
phase, reflected, for example, in the 67.9% rate of receiving PSA testing in the past 3 years, 
and the effect of high, even if equal across arms, control arm screening in the post-screening 
phase is not clear. The model used for the above power computations assumed no control 
arm PSA testing outside of the 38% receiving yearly screening, and no post-screening phase 
testing in either arm12. More complex modeling is needed to assess the effect on trial power 
of the observed pattern of non-protocol control (and intervention) arm use of PSA. The 
average 84% compliance rate for PSA screening in the intervention arm is substantially 
greater than the 46% comparable screening phase control arm rate, and the prostate cancer 
incidence risk-ratio of 1.27 during that phase clearly shows more screening in the 
intervention than control arm during that period. On the other hand, with most control arm 
men (86%) receiving some PSA testing during the trial, and with almost half receiving

 annual screening, the dilution of power due to contamination is likely to have been 
substantial.
Given the high control arm use of PSA testing, PLCO has often been described as a trial of 
organized screening versus “opportunistic” screening. Viewed in this light, the assumed 
reduction in prostate cancer mortality in the intervention compared to control arm would be 
considerably less than the 27% true mortality reduction referred to above, since both arms 
would be receiving some screening, but there would be, by definition, no “contamination”. 
The actual power of the trial is the same, whichever way the trial is regarded, but in this 
interpretation the power is reduced because the postulated expected mortality reduction 
between arms is lowered. Therefore, the trial can be viewed as showing no mortality benefit 
of organized versus opportunistic screening, with somewhat low power due to an expected 
modest difference in prostate cancer mortality between arms.
In addition to power, another important consideration for null trials is the width of the 
confidence interval on the primary endpoint. With this extended follow-up, the lower 95% 
CI for the mortality relative risk was unchanged from the prior analysis, at 0.87. Even 
though the width of the entire confidence interval was narrowed due to the larger number of 
events, the point estimate was decreased towards 1.0, resulting in an unchanged lower 95% 
CI. It is important to interpret this lower limit correctly. Due to the high contamination rate, 
it should not be considered as the lower 95% bound on the “true” mortality effect (as defined 
above) of prostate screening. Rather, under the interpretation of PLCO as a trial of an 
organized screening program versus “opportunistic screening”, the lower 95% bound should 
be interpreted in that context. In other words, organized screening compared to opportunistic 
screening could give a mortality benefit as high as 13% (or a harm as much as 24%).
An analysis by non-PLCO investigators suggested that a higher percentage of PLCO control 
arm than intervention arm men received any PSA tests14. This is not correct, as the analysis 
neglected to take into account the fact that the HSQ survey data for the intervention arm only 
concerned non-PLCO protocol PSA tests15. As seen here, and reported elsewhere, the true 
rate of ever-PSA testing was 99% in the intervention arm, and 86% in the control arm15.
Recently, the results of the PROTECT trial, which compared curative treatment (surgery and 
radiotherapy) to active monitoring in men with screen detected localized prostate cancer, 
were reported16. Deaths from prostate cancer over a median 10 years of follow-up were very 
low in each arm, at most 1.5%, and no significant difference was observed between the 
active monitoring and curative treatment arms. The incidence of metastases was statistically 
significantly higher in the active monitoring arm, although the overall rate (6%) was low. 
Since the efficacy of screening is premised on the assumption that earlier treatment leads to 
reduced prostate cancer deaths, the PROTECT results raise provocative questions as to the 
timing and magnitude of any effect of screening on prostate cancer mortality.
An intriguing finding was the borderline significant reduction in all-cause mortality in the 
intervention arm (p-value of 0.06 and 0.11 for the risk ratio and hazard ratio, respectively). 
This borderline association was also reported in a prior analysis of PLCO with follow-up 
through 13 years6. It is possible that the increased contact with medical professionals

 brought on by screening, and not just for prostate cancer but for lung and colorectal cancer 
as well, might have resulted in decreased mortality. However, this is more likely a chance 
finding, especially given the fact that examination of the causes of death shows no clear 
pattern by trial arm.
Conclusion
Extended follow-up of the PLCO trial through up to 19 years continues to show no prostate 
cancer mortality benefit of screening with PSA and DRE for the intervention compared to 
the control arm. Due to the high rate of control arm PSA testing, this finding can be viewed 
as showing no benefit of organized over opportunistic screening with PSA.

1Total surveyed excludes unknowns and those with prior prostate cancer diagnosis. Percentages exclude both groups.
2For intervention arm, rates include PLCO protocol screening tests taken in the relevant time period (for tests within the past 3 years) or at any time (for PSA tests ever). Note the intervention arm HSQ 
survey only asks about PSA tests taken outside of the PLCO protocol.
3Adjusted to included “baseline contaminated” subjects. See text for details.
