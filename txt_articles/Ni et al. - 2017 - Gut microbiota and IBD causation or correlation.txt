Abstract
A general consensus exists that IBD is associated with compositional and metabolic changes in the 
intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis). However, a direct causal relationship between dysbiosis and IBD 
has not been definitively established in humans. Findings from animal models have revealed 
diverse and context-specific roles of the gut microbiota in health and disease, ranging from 
protective to pro-inflammatory actions. Moreover, evidence from these experimental models 
suggest that although gut bacteria often drive immune activation, chronic inflammation in turn 
shapes the gut microbiota and contributes to dysbiosis. The purpose of this Review is to 
summarize current associations between IBD and dysbiosis, describe the role of the gut microbiota 
in the context of specific animal models of colitis, and discuss the potential role of microbiota-
focused interventions in the treatment of human IBD. Ultimately, more studies will be needed to 
define host–microbial relationships relevant to human disease and amenable to therapeutic 
interventions.
IBD, including crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, affects ∼3.1 million people in the USA 
and is increasing in incidence worldwide1,2. IBD is characterized by chronic immune-
mediated intestinal inflammation that is driven by both genetic predisposition and 
environmental factors such as diet, antibiotic use and socioeconomic development3.
A key role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD has long been postulated; 
however, definitive cause–effect mechanistic relationships have been challenging to prove 
outside of specific animal models. In particular, IBD has been associated with dysbiosis, 
defined as a decrease in gut microbial diversity owing to a shift in the balance between 
commensal and potentially pathogenic microorganisms4–7. Indeed, the clinical observation 
that IBD can respond to antibiotic treatment is consistent with the idea that intestinal 
bacteria contribute to the inflammatory response8,9. Other observations supporting a role for 
the gut microbiota in IBD include the predisposition of inflammation for anatomical regions 
with relative faecal stasis (terminal ileum and rectum), the effectiveness of faecal diversion

 as a treatment for Crohn's disease10–12, and the rapidly increasing incidence of IBD globally 
associated with industrialization and accompanying alterations in diet and environmental 
exposures13,14.
Although these associations are consistent with a role of the gut microbiota in IBD 
pathogenesis, the precise role of dysbiosis is less clear. Studies attempting to determine 
whether dysbiosis is truly causative or merely a consequence of inflammation have suffered 
from a number of limitations, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions (BOX 1). In 
this Review, we will describe current associations between IBD and dysbiosis, the role of the 
gut microbiota in the context of specific animal models, and the potential clinical translation 
of microbiota-centered therapeutic approaches for human IBD.
Microbiota composition and IBD
Multiple studies have documented differences in the composition of the gut microbiota 
between patients with IBD and healthy individuals, particularly with respect to microbial 
diversity and the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa. Both expansion of potential 
pathogens and global changes in composition (that is, increased or decreased abundance of 
indicator species) have been described. For example, the phylum Firmicutes — specifically 
Faecailbacterium prausnitzii — is often reduced in proportional abundance in the stool of 
patients with Crohn's disease7,15–24, although studies focused on mucosal biopsies have 
questioned this association25,26. Conversely, members of the Proteobacteria phylum, such as 
Enterobacteriaceae27,28, including Escherichia coli19,29,30, are commonly increased in 
patients with IBD relative to healthy individuals. Differences in the composition of the gut 
microbiota have been documented even between members of the same family (including 
twins) who are discordant for IBD31,32, suggesting that dysbiosis is primarily associated 
with disease state rather than environmental or genetic factors. Such cross-sectional studies 
do not provide information about the timing of dysbiosis relative to disease onset and, 
therefore, should be interpreted with caution particularly with regards to cause–effect 
relationships. For example, mucosal biopsies from twin pairs discordant for ulcerative colitis 
have shown a reduction in gut microbiota diversity in both siblings relative to unrelated 
healthy individuals, but the changes were more pronounced in the affected twin33. However, 
as the unaffected twins were not followed prospectively, it is not clear whether these findings 
reflected the gradual development of dysbiosis before the onset of IBD or, on the contrary, a 
lack of association between dysbiosis and clinical disease.
Studies of paediatric cohorts have attempted to address the temporal relationship between 
dysbiosis and inflammmation. Although there has been debate over the degree of dysbiosis 
in paediatric patients, particularly at the mucosal level, most studies have shown substantial 
differences between diseased and healthy individuals34,35. Thus, dysbiotic changes were 
described in stool and mucosal biopsies from newly diagnosed, treatment-naive children 
with Crohn's disease, suggesting that dysbiosis might precede clinical disease and develop 
independently of long-standing inflammation and/or medical therapy36. A prospective study 
of paediatric patients with Crohn's disease similarly concluded that dysbiosis reflected the 
presence and severity of inflammation; however, this study also found an independent 
association between dysbiosis and other factors such as diet and the use of antibiotics37.

 Thus, while changes in the gut microbiota might occur early in IBD and perhaps contribute 
to the onset of disease, over time environmental factors, including inflammation itself, 
probably further contribute to dysbiosis by altering the metabolic conditions in the gut 
(discussed later).
Although global changes in the microbiota of patients with IBD have been documented, 
strong evidence for the existence of specific pathobionts — commensal microorganisms that, 
under specific environmental or genetic influences, can cause IBD38 — is limited. 
Enterobacteriaceae, and in particular certain strains of adherent–invasive E. coli (AIEC), 
have been associated with the ileal mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease39 and have been 
proposed as potential pathobionts based on their ability replicate in epithelial cells in vitro40. 
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis has also been investigated as a potential 
cause of Crohn's disease owing to its ability to cause chronic granulomatous enteritis in 
sheep and cattle41–44; however, clinical studies have not borne out this hypothesis45,46. 
Similarly, a specific association between Fusobacterium nucleatum, ulcerative colitis and the 
development of colorectal cancer has been proposed based on the isolation of a highly 
invasive strain from patients with ulcerative colitis, but a clear cause-and-effect relationship 
has not been proven47,48. Pathobionts probably act in concert with the rest of the gut 
microbiota to cause disease, rather than as individual infectious agents, a possibility 
supported by observations in animal models (discussed later).
Although it is tempting to postulate an inciting role of the microbiota in IBD pathogenesis, it 
should be emphasized that the studies discussed so far describe associations and do not 
prove causation. In fact, evidence suggests that dysbiosis in IBD might, in large part, reflect 
the response of a complex microbial community to the environmental stress of intestinal 
inflammation. In the healthy gastrointestinal tract a radial oxygen gradient exists due to the 
diffusion of oxygen from the host mucosa into the gut lumen49–51. Accordingly, bacteria 
adherent to the colonic mucosa have higher oxygen tolerance and catalase expression 
relative to faeces-associated species51. As inflammation is an oxidative state, it might be 
expected to promote the outgrowth of aerotolerant taxa such as Proteobacteria and 
Actinobacteria. Indeed, the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium has been shown to gain a 
fitness advantage by promoting epithelial aerobic respiration and increasing oxygenation of 
the mucosal surface52. Alternatively, several lines of evidence have shown that intestinal 
inflammation induces the production of small molecules that serve as terminal electron 
acceptors for facultative anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae37,53. Thus, metabolic 
alterations associated with inflammation and/or pathobiont colonization might act as 
microbial stressors and promote the outgrowth of dysbiotic species.
The nonbacterial microbiota and IBD
The virome and IBD
To date, most studies investigating the link between inflammation and the microbiota have 
focused on bacteria. However, the microbiome also includes fungi and viruses, and the role 
of these microorganisms in health and disease is being increasingly appreciated. Shotgun 
metagenomic analyses of viral particles isolated from faecal samples have shown that the gut 
virome is composed predominantly of bacteriophages54–56. Changes in bacteriophage

 composition associated with IBD have been described, most notably an increase in 
Caudovirales bacteriophage sequences in ileal biopsy samples and intestinal washes from 
paediatric patients with Crohn's disease57,58. Importantly, expansion of Caudovirales 
bacteriophages was associated with a reduction in bacterial diversity. Through their diverse 
effects on bacteria — ranging from cell lysis to the transfer of genetic material encoding 
toxins or antibiotic resistance — phages can confer differential fitness on their hosts and 
influence the microbial composition of the gut (FIG. 1). Whether bacteriophages have a 
direct role in IBD pathogenesis, or merely reflect underlying dysbiosis remains to be 
determined. Similarly, a clear role for eukaryotic viruses in IBD has not been established59.
The mycobiome and IBD
Antibodies directed against cell wall components of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been 
associated with Crohn's disease since 1988 (REF. 60), but the clinical relevance of this 
finding remains unclear. Owing to technical challenges such as the misattribution of 
sequences and incorrect annotation of fungi in current genomic databases, relatively few 
studies have examined the role of fungi in IBD61,62. Fungal sequences can now be identified 
via culture- independent methods by PCR amplification of the small 18S ribosomal subunit 
or the internal transcribed spacer region62,63, allowing for more comprehensive assessment 
of the mycobiome in health and disease.
A study of the stool-associated mycobiome showed an overall increased representation of 
fungi in paediatric patients with Crohn's disease compared with healthy individuals, however 
the same five taxa accounted for the majority of fungi in both groups37. Moreover, success 
ful therapy was associated with partial resolution of bacterial dysbiosis but did not lead to 
reduction in fungal colonization, putting into question the causative role of fungi in 
inflammation. Indeed, antibiotic treatment, which is commonly used in Crohn's disease, was 
independently associated with expansion of the same fungal taxa37. On the other hand, a 
study of adults with IBD did show differences in the relative abundance of specific fungi 
between patients with IBD and healthy controls64. Specifically, fungal dysbiosis in IBD was 
associated with an increased Basidiomycota:Ascomycota ratio, a decreased proportion of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and an increased abundance of Candida albicans. This study 
further suggested that the inflammatory environment of Crohn's disease favours the 
expansion of fungi over bacteria (FIG. 1). Such a conclusion, however, should be interpreted 
with caution given the multiple confounders inherent in human research (BOX 1).
Studies of the mucosa-associated fungal composition have yielded similarly varied results. 
One study found that overall fungal diversity was higher in patients with IBD relative to 
healthy individuals, with several species detected only in Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis 
samples, although no consistent pattern could be discerned65. This study also showed 
substantial differences in the fungal composition of stool and mucosal samples. Another 
study of paediatric patients failed to show statistically significant changes in the mycobiome 
of patients with Crohn's disease relative to healthy individuals, except for enrichment of the 
genus Malassezia which varied by geographical location35. The relative abundance of 
Basidiomycota and Ascomycota has also been examined in mucosal samples. In a study of 
paediatric patients, the Basidiomycota:Ascomycota ratio was found to be increased in

 Crohn's disease compared with healthy individuals, similar to the findings above for stool66. 
On the other hand, in another study of adults with Crohn's disease, no discernible pattern 
with regards to these two phyla was seen67.
Mechanistically, the involvement of fungi in IBD pathogenesis is plausible as a number of 
IBD susceptibility genes in mice and humans are involved in antifungal immune responses 
(for example, CARD9, CLEC7A and RELA)68. Mice lacking dectin-1 (encoded by Clec7a), 
the innate immune receptor that recognizes β-glucans in the fungal cell wall, have increased 
susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis due to the expansion of opportunistic 
pathogenic fungi69. Similarly, Card9-/- mice have altered bacterial and fungal microbiota that 
cannot metabolize tryptophan into ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and, therefore, 
fail to upregulate IL-22, which is necessary for recovery from colitis70. More recently, S. 
cerevisiae colonization was shown to promote purine metabolism in mice, leading to 
elevated levels of uric acid, which has direct pro-inflammatory proper-ties71. Conversely, a 
protective role for the normal gut mycobiome (including Malassezia spp. and C. albicans) 
has also been postulated. For example, prolonged treatment of mice with the antifungal 
agent fluconazole leads to fungal dysbiosis characterized by the expansion of opportunistic 
species including Aspergillus amstelodami, Epicoccum nigrum, and Wallemia sebi. Mice 
enriched for these fungal organisms have worse outcomes of both DSS-associated and T-
cell-transfer-mediated colitis with increased numbers of IFNγ and IL-17-secreting CD4+ T 
cells in the intestine72. Collectively, these animal models suggest that fungi might influence 
intestinal health and disease by suppressing the outgrowth of potential pathobionts, 
promoting immunoregulatory pathways, and modulating host metabolism. However, as 
illustrated by the human studies discussed earlier, establishing a direct causal relation ship 
between specific fungal species and health and disease remains challenging.
Microbial metabolites and IBD
Changes in the the composition of the gut microbiota lead to metabolite alterations that are 
likely to have a role in IBD pathogenesis. Through metabolomics, correlations between 
microbial composition and specific bacterial metabolic pathways can be established and the 
effects of small molecule (<1,500 Da) products on IBD pathogenesis assessed73. When the 
gut micro biota of healthy individuals and patients with IBD were compared, 12% of 
metabolic pathways were markedly different, compared with just 2% of genus-level 
clades74. Specifically, amino acid biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism pathways were 
reduced in the IBD micro-biome in favour of nutrient uptake, virulence and secretion 
pathways. Moreover, expression of genes related to oxidative stress, such as glutathione and 
sulfate transport, were increased74. These findings likely reflect the microbial response to 
the inflammatory intestinal environment of IBD and suggest that functional, rather than 
compositional, differences might be more informative when studying dysbiosis.
The microbial production of metabolites might affect the host in other ways that are relevant 
to IBD pathogenesis. For example, bile acid signalling via the nuclear farnesoid-activated X 
receptor (FXR, also known as bile acid receptor) has been shown to be protective in DSS 
and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid models of colitis by inhibiting NF-κB signalling75. 
As bile salt hydrolases (BSH) in intestinal bacteria play a key part in bile acid modification, 
Ni et al.

 dysbiosis could have a direct effect on FXR signalling. Indeed, in silico analysis showed that 
the relative abundance of BSH in the gut microbiota was markedly reduced in patients with 
IBD compared with healthy individuals, and this reduction was most evident among 
Firmicutes from patients with Crohn's disease76. Consistent with these findings, levels of 
secondary bile acids are decreased in patients with IBD, particularly during flares77. 
Collectively, these data are consistent with a model in which impaired microbial enzymatic 
activity in IBD leads to altered bile salt metabolism and loss of anti-inflammatory signalling 
through FXR.
Another bacterial metabolic pathway with relevance to IBD is the production of short-chain 
fatty acids (SCFAs) through the fermentation of undigestable carbohydrates. SCFAs 
produced by specific clades of Clostridia spp. have been shown to augment regulatory T 
(Treg)-cell function in the intestinal mucosa through the activation of G protein-coupled 
receptors as well as via epigenetic effects leading to inhibition of histone deacetylase78. This 
process promotes restoration of immune tolerance and reduces inflammation in mouse 
models of colitis and asthma78,79. Efforts to target these pathways, either by altering the gut 
microbiota or through novel small molecule drugs are currently underway.
Host mucosal immune system: animal models
As discussed earlier, the gastrointestinal tract is populated by trillions of microorganisms 
that normally have a commensal or mutualistic relationship with their host. This healthy 
coexistence is maintained by a variety of immune mechanisms including secretion of mucus, 
immunoglobulin a (IgA), and antimicrobial peptides that shape the gut microbiota and 
prevent direct contact with the epithelium80. Conversely, the intestinal microbiota influences 
immune function in both health and disease. For example, germ-free mice have impaired 
immune development81 and epithelial repair82, while treatment with oral antibiotics can 
worsen the outcome of viral infections in mice83. In humans, the use of antibiotics in early 
childhood has been associated with increased risk of Crohn's disease, suggesting the 
microbiota might help set the threshold for immune activation versus tolerance84. 
Alternatively, antibiotics can potentiate the expansion of pathobionts such as Clostridium 
difficile, which is best managed by restoring intestinal microbial diversity using faecal 
microbiota transplantation85. Thus, the micro biota suppresses pathogens, promotes immune 
tolerance, initiates epithelial repair, and ensures the development of balanced immune cell 
subsets.
The healthy relationship between host and gut micro-biota is tested at times of mucosal 
injury when changes in immune activation and microbiota composition are likely to take 
place80. Given its vast surface area and constant exposure to the environment, the intestinal 
epithelial barrier is susceptible to damage by pathogens, ischaemia and environmental 
toxins. Numerous animal models of colitis have explored the diverse ways in which such 
insults lead to chronic inflammation in genetically predisposed animals, revealing complex 
immune– microbial interactions. Notably, although animal models have greatly advanced 
our understanding of IBD pathogenesis, they have inherent limitations (BOX 2). 
Nevertheless, these systems have enforced the notion of ‘dysregulated’ immunity as a key 
driver of IBD and have established diverse and context-dependent roles for the gut micro-

 biota in health and disease. In the following sections the issue of causation versus correlation 
of dysbiosis will be considered in the context of specific IBD animal models.
IL-23 signalling, TH17 cells and type 3 innate lymphoid cells
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have established a role for IL-23 signalling in the 
pathogenesis of several immune-mediated diseases including IBD86. Polymorphisms in 
genes encoding the β subunit of IL-23 (IL-12p40), its receptor, and downstream signalling 
molecules (STAT3 and JAK2) have been implicated87, while blockade of IL-12p40 is an 
effective treatment for Crohn's disease according to a phase III clinical trial88. IL-23 is 
secreted by intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and promotes the expansion of type 17 T helper 
(TH17) cells and type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). Development of these immune 
subsets is driven by the transcriptional factor RORγt and their signature cytokines (IL-17, 
IL-21 and IL-22) have key roles in mucosal defenses and immunopathology89,90.
IL-23 signalling is central in the adoptive T-cell transfer and T-bet−/−RAG−/− ulcerative 
colitis (TRUC) models of spontaneous colitis91. In the adoptive T-cell transfer model, naive 
CD4+ donor T cells induce spontaneous colitis when transferred to SCID (severe combined 
immunodeficiency) or Rag−/− recipients lacking adaptive immunity92. Inflammation in this 
model is mediated by TH17 cells and T cells of a mixed phenotype capable of secreting both 
IL-17 and type 1 cytokines (such as IFNγ)93,94. TRUC mice, on the other hand, lack both 
adaptive immunity and T-bet-dependent components of innate immunity (including ILC1 
and NKp46+ ILC3s). In this setting, IL-23 signalling leads to expansion of NKp46− ILC3 
that mediate inflammation via IL-17 and IL-22 secretion91.
A key feature of the adoptive transfer and TRUC models is their dependence on the 
microbiota, as germ-free animals do not develop colitis. In the adoptive T-cell transfer 
model, several specific micro organisms have been implicated, including Helicobacter 
muridarum, Helicobacter hepaticus and segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB); however, in 
most cases, colonization with a defined cocktail of specific pathogen- free (SPF) bacteria is 
also required for colitis to develop95–97. Conversely, co-colonization with the human 
symbiont Bacteroides fragilis reverses the inflammatory effects of Helicobacter hepaticus by 
promoting Treg-cell develop-ment98,99. Similarly, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus 
mirabilis cause colitis in TRUC mice, but only in the presence of the endogen ous 
microbiota100. Thus, the inflammatory potential of individual pathobionts is ultimately 
determined by the overall composition of the gut microbiota. Moreover, TRUC mice can 
transmit colitis even to wild-type animals, suggesting that the inflammatory environment can 
condition the gut microbiota to cause disease even in the absence of host risk factors101.
Regulatory T cells and immune tolerance
Treg cells are a distinct subset of helper T cells defined by the transcription factor FOXP3 
and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. As with TH17 cells, Treg cells are induced by 
transforming growth factor (TGF) β, accumulate at mucosal surfaces, and differentiate under 
the influence of commensal organisms and environmental signals81,102,103. In humans, 
mutations in FOXP3 lead to chronic enteritis104, whereas blockade of SMAD7, an inhibitor 
of TGFβ, improves inflammation by augmenting Treg-cell function105,106. Similarly, IL10

 polymorphisms have been associated with human IBD in GWAS, and congenital IL-10 
deficiency leads to severe childhood colitis107,108. Not surprisingly, spontaneous colitis in 
Il10−/− mice depends on the gut microbiota and is driven by unopposed TH17 cells109,110. 
Conversely, specific microbial species — including Bacteroides fragilis98,99 and a 
consortium of human-derived Clostridia strains111 — can alleviate inflammation in several 
colitis models by promoting Treg-cell development (FIG. 2). Thus, the relative abundance of 
TH17 and Treg cells is a key factor in determining intestinal inflammation versus tolerance. 
By differentially promoting the development of these immune subsets, the gut microbiota 
have an important role in maintaining or disrupting intestinal homeostasis.
Microbial sensing, the inflammasome and epithelial repair
The complex relationship between the gut microbiota and intestinal inflammation is further 
illustrated by innate models of colitis. Innate immune cells detect pathogenic and 
commensal bacteria via a conserved set of pattern-recognition receptors that are linked to 
NF-κB activation, inflammasome assembly, and epithelial repair pathways (FIG. 2). A 
number of these receptors — most notably NOD2, NLRP3, and several Toll-like receptors 
(TLRs) — have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD by GWAS112–118. Animal 
models involving NOD-like receptor (NLR) or TLR signalling defects have revealed a 
complex and context-dependent role of innate immunity in colitis, ranging from protective to 
pro-inflammatory.
MYD88 is a central adaptor for signalling through most TLRs, as well as the IL-1 and IL-18 
receptors, and disruption of this protein leads to profound innate immune dysfunction82. 
Administration of DSS to Myd88−/− mice results in severe and lethal colitis which, in 
contrast to the models discussed earlier, is not driven by the gut microbiota82. Thus, germ-
free Myd88−/− mice are not protected from DSS, and in fact antibiotic treatment of wild-type 
animals exacerbates disease severity82, consistent with a protective role for the gut 
microbiota. Indeed, bacterial sensing and signalling through TLRs is critical for epithelial 
repair by promoting secretion of tissue-protective factors, inhibiting apoptosis, and 
recruiting stromal and myeloid cells to the colonic crypts119-124. Thus, the normal gut 
microbiota is essential for restoring homeostasis after acute mucosal injury.
A number of other mouse models have linked TLR and NLR signalling to epithelial repair 
and homeostasis after DSS injury. For example, absence of NF-κB activation in Nemo (also 
known as Ikbkg)−/− or Ikk1/2 (also known as Chuk–Ikbk)−/− mice results in spontaneous 
colitis characterized by increased epithelial apoptosis125. Similarly, inflammasome 
disruption via deletion of NLRP3 (linked to IBD in GWAS), NLRP6, PYCARD, caspase 1, 
or IL-18 leads to impaired epithelial repair and increased cancer susceptibility126–130. 
However, in most of these mouse models, defects in innate immunity also lead to the 
outgrowth and translocation of pathogens that contribute to the overall disease phenotype 
and respond to antibiotic treatment125,128. For example, DSS colitis in NLRP6-deficient 
mice is complicated by the outgrowth of Prevotellaceae species, which can exacerbate 
disease when transferred to wild-type animals130. Similarly, Myd88−/− mice develop severe 
colitis and bacteraemia when colonized with the pathogen Citrobacter rodentium131,132

 (FIG. 2). Thus, sensing of the gut microbiota by innate immune cells maintains intestinal 
homeostasis by both limiting bacterial growth and promoting epithelial repair.
Paneth cells, autophagy and Crohn's ileitis
Autophagy is a conserved process of targeted degradation of cytoplasmic pathogens and 
cellular components via the formation of a double-membrane vesicle133. This pathway has 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease by GWAS, which have identified 
susceptibility loci in the ATG16L1 and IRGM autophagy genes134,135. ATG16L1 has been 
linked to NOD2 activation136,137 and plays a key part in the function of Paneth cells, 
specialized epithelial cells located in the intestinal crypt base138. Paneth cells shape the gut 
microbiota via secretion of antimicrobial peptides139; conversely, dysfunction of these cells 
has been associated with Crohn's disease140. Cadwell et al.141 have shown that mice 
hypomorphic for ATG16L1 develop Paneth cell defects upon infection with a chronic strain 
of murine norovirus (MNV). Subsequent administration of DSS to such MNV-infected mice 
triggers Crohn's disease-like colonic lesions in a microbiota-dependent manner. This model 
provides an elegant example of the convergence of genetic, environmental and microbial 
factors to produce the clinical phenotype of Crohn's disease.
Paneth cell dysfunction and dysbiosis have also been implicated in the TNFΔARE model of 
Crohn's disease ileitis142. TNFΔARE mice have dysregulated TNF expression due to 
deletions in the AU-rich elements (ARE) of Tnf, leading to chronic ileal inflammation143. 
Ileitis in conventionally reared TNFΔARE mice is microbiota-dependent and can be 
attenuated by antibiotic treatment. Remarkably, TNFΔARE mice reared in an SPF 
environment, develop discrete gradients of disease activity ranging from normal to severe 
ileitis. These clinical phenotypes correspond to distinct degrees of dysbiosis and Paneth cell 
dysfunction in individual mice. Moreover, the gut microbiota from inflamed, but not from 
healthy, TNFΔARE mice can transmit ileitis and Paneth cell defects to germ-free TNFΔARE 
recipients, pointing to a direct causal relationship between dysbiosis and inflammation.
IgA-coated taxa in the gut microbiota as possible pathobionts in IBD
IgA is the predominant antibody isotype at mucosal surfaces and exerts protective and 
immuno-regulatory effects by modulating the composition of the gut microbiota144. IgA 
coating of intestinal bacteria can distinguish colitogenic (IgA+) from commensal (IgA-) 
species, and IgA+ bacteria identified in this manner include known pathobionts 
(Prevotellaceae, Helicobacter and SFB) capable of mediating DSS-induced colitis when 
transferred to SPF mice145. Moreover, IgA+ bacteria isolated from patients with IBD, but not 
from healthy individuals, led to severe DSS-induced colitis when transferred to SPF mice145. 
A major feature that dis tinguished colitogenic IgA+ from non-colitogenic IgA− bacteria was 
the ability of the former to penetrate the mucus layer and trigger T-cell-dependent high-
affinity IgA production (FIG. 2). Thus, identifying colitogenic bacteria based on IgA coating 
could eventually lead to a personalized treatment approach for IBD. These findings further 
suggest that IgA has an anti-inflammatory role by selectively neutralizing colitogenic 
bacteria. Consistent with this interpretation, IgA deficiency has been associated with a 3.9 
and 5.7 prevalence ratio for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, respectively146.

 Human IBD: evidence from clinical studies
As discussed in the preceding sections, dysbiosis in patients with IBD has been well-
documented. Moreover, the microbiota have a variety of roles in IBD models of intestinal 
inflammation, ranging from protective to causative. As many such models have been 
informed by GWAS data and are based on knockouts of human susceptibility genes, one 
might speculate that bacteria, fungi and viruses have similar roles in human IBD. However, 
as discussed in BOXES 1, 2, results from animal studies have a number of limitations and 
must be interpre ted with caution, especially with regards to their relevance to human 
disease. The question of whether dysbiosis precedes the development of IBD and sets the 
inflammatory process in motion, or merely reflects the altered immune and metabolic 
environment of the inflamed mucosa, remains to be answered. Although a number of human 
participant studies support a causal role of dys biosis in IBD pathogenesis, conclusions are 
limited by the lack of prospective data.
IBD preferentially affects intestinal regions with the highest abundance of bacteria, and both 
faecal diversion and antibiotics can be effective in the management of Crohn's disease10–12. 
Individuals with active Crohn's disease who undergo ileocolonic resection and placement of 
a diverting ileostomy often have a normal neoterminal ileum 3–6 months after surgery11,147. 
Moreover, infusion of the proximal ileum effluent into the excluded distal ileum can lead to 
disease recurrence, although the precise factor(s) mediating inflammation have not been 
determined147. Of note, faecal stream diversion is not universally effective and can itself be 
colitogenic by depriving colonocytes of SCFAs normally produced by resident bacteria148.
The possibility that inflammation in IBD might be driven by the gut microbiota has 
informed a number of clinical approaches aimed at correcting dysbiosis by dietary or 
microbial interventions. Examples include the use of probiotics, antibiotics, defined enteral 
nutritional therapy (ENT), and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Probiotics are 
mixtures of bacteria or yeasts with perceived beneficial health effects, utilized to restore gut 
microbial balance149. To date, evidence for the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of IBD 
is equivocal149. The most compelling findings come from post-surgical patients with 
ulcerative colitis who have undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Such patients are 
predisposed to inflammation of the ileal pouch (pouchitis) and probiotics have been shown 
to be effective in preventing this complication following successful antibiotic 
treatment149,150. However, basic questions regarding the optimal composition of probiotics, 
timing of administration and durability of the response remain unanswered.
Antibiotics can alleviate inflammation in various animal models of colitis; however, their 
effectiveness in human IBD has been limited. Two meta-analyses of randomized controlled 
trials did show a statistically significant benefit of antibiotics relative to placebo in the 
treatment of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (relative risk of remission or relapse 
between 0.62 and 0.85 (REF. 8); odds ratio 1.35 to 2.17 in favour of antibiotics9. Moreover, 
several studies have shown that broad-spectrum antibiotics improved rates of steroid-free 
remission in ulcerative colitis151–153. Given the phenotypic heterogeneity of IBD and the 
diversity of human populations, it is not surprising that inconsistent outcomes of antibiotic 
treatment have been reported. Indiscriminately targeting the gut microbiota with broad-

 spectrum antibiotics probably depletes beneficial, as well as pathogenic, microorganisms 
with potentially unpredictable consequences. As with probiotics, future antibiotic regimens 
might have to be tailored to individual patients based on their specific gut microbiota 
composition and genetic makeup.
Diet has been shown to have a major effect on the composition of the gut microbiota by 
altering its functionality and metabolism at the genomic level154. Epidemiological evidence 
points to a role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBD, and dietary modification has long been 
used as therapy for Crohn's disease155. ENT with elemental, semi-elemental, or polymeric 
formulas can be used as first-line therapy for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease 
and has been associated with both clinical improvement and mucosal healing156–161. 
Although the mechanism of action of ENT has not been well defined, hypotheses include 
reduction in luminal antigens secondary to food exclusion and/or modulation of the gut 
microbiota and its metabolome. Several studies have shown a change in faecal microbiota 
composition following ENT therapy37,162,163, as well as functional changes leading to 
increased levels of anti-inflammatory SCFAs in children with Crohn's disease164. ENT was 
effective in inducing remission in paediatric patients with Crohn's disease, and was 
associated with rapid changes in gut microbiota composition37. Another study further 
showed that ENT was associated with reduced numbers of Treg cells in the lamina propria, 
reflecting the resolution of intestinal inflammation165. Notably, favourable therapeutic 
outcomes of ENT that we and others have reported was associated with initial shifts in 
microbial composition towards even greater dysbiosis relative to healthy individuals37,166. 
These observations highlight the need to further explore the effects of diet on microbial 
composition and disease activity, and further point to the complex relationship between 
dysbiosis and IBD.
FMT has been explored as a strategy to correct dysbiosis. The success of FMT for the 
treatment of refractory Clostridium difficile infection167 has generated strong interest in 
using this approach in IBD. However, clinical results so far have been varied, possibly 
reflecting the higher complexity of IBD compared to C. difficile colitis168–171. Two 
randomized, placebo-controlled trials for the treatment of ulcerative colitis showed that FMT 
was markedly more effective than placebo in inducing clinical and endoscopic remission in 
ulcerative colitis in adults172,173. However, one other recent randomized, placebo-controlled 
trail failed to show a similar benefit of FMT174. Even fewer studies have explored FMT for 
the treatment of Crohn's disease and no randomized-controlled clinical trials have yet been 
completed although several are ongoing175,176. In children, FMT has shown clinical benefit 
in a small cohort of patients with Crohn's disease177, whereas a pilot study of FMT in adult 
refractory Crohn's disease resulted in high rates of clinical remission and clinical 
improvement178. Overall, data regarding FMT are scarce and questions remain regarding the 
safety and durability of this approach (short-term and long-term), particularly in 
immunosuppressed patients; the most effective mode of administration; and how to select 
appropriate donors and recipients. Larger randomized controlled trials are necessary to better 
define the role of FMT in the treatment of IBD.

 Conclusions
In this Review, we have summarized human microbiome and metabolome associations with 
IBD, provided an overview of animal models with a focus on host–microbial interactions 
and their effect on mucosal homeostasis, and discussed the potential therapeutic role of the 
gut micro-biota in IBD management. Our analysis seems to suggest a greater effect of the 
gut microbiota on disease phenotype and activity in mice than in humans receiving 
microbial-based therapies. What is the basis for this difference? One interpretation is that the 
micro biota plays, at most, a limited part in the pathogenesis of human IBD and dysbiosis is 
simply a marker of disease (BOX 3). Such a conclusion is supported by a longitudinal 
analysis published in 2017 of faecal microbiota from patients with IBD, which failed to 
show a correlation between the degree of dysbiosis and Crohn's disease severity24. It should 
be noted, however, that the authors used faecal calprotectin levels as a marker of disease 
activity and, therefore, might have underestimated the severity of ileal inflammation. In fact, 
the same study showed that recent steroid use (which probably reflected disease 
exacerbation) did correlate with increased microbiome instability. Similarly, a study of 
paediatric patients with IBD showed a significant correlation between microbota 
composition and disease severity, with resolution of dysbiosis in patients responding to anit-
TNF therapy179. Nevertheless, a clear cause-effect relationship between dysbiosis and 
human IBD reamins to be definitively established.
We believe in a nuanced interpretation of the differences between mouse and human studies. 
First, responses to the gut microbiota are likely to differ between mammalian species. 
Second, mice are genetically homogenous, consume a monotonous diet, and inhabit a well-
defined environment, in which the micro-biota is shared between co-housed cagemates 
through coprophagia. The latter observation probably accounts for the substantial ‘cage 
effects’ observed in microbiome studies180. Third, similarities between mice are amplified 
further in germ-free or gnotobiotic studies in which even fewer differences are present 
between individual animals. This uniformity contributes to a high signal-to-noise ratio and 
enables investigators to observe reproducible outcomes with relatively low numbers of 
experimental animals. Such tightly controlled experimental conditions have been critical in 
establishing cause–effect relationships and uncovering novel biological responses and 
pathways.
By contrast, humans live in a highly variable environment, exhibit genetic diversity, and 
consume a variable diet. This inherent variability is even more pronounced in IBD in which 
disease activity, medication use, and numerous environmental factors such as smoking can 
modulate the individual response to the gut microbiota and their metabolites. Indeed, 
intersubject variability is often one of the largest sources of variance in human gut 
microbiome studies, leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio that can obscure meaningful 
biological outcomes. Thus, one of the lessons learned from microbiota-based interventional 
studies in humans might be that such approaches show a hint of promise but will require 
further adjustment to amplify the favourable clinical response above the threshold of normal 
human variation. To address these issues, there is a need for large prospective longitudinal 
studies such as the Genetic Environmental Microbial (GEM) Project to define interactions

 between human genetics, environmental factors, and microbial composition that contribute 
to the development of IBD181.
It is important to recognize that the relationship between dysbiosis and IBD is probably 
complex and dynamic, rather than one of simple cause–effect. Thus, the view of dysbiosis as 
the response of a complex micro-bial community to the environmental stress of 
inflammation or medication use is not incompatible with the notion that dysbiosis plays a 
direct role in IBD pathogenesis. For example, dysbiosis might not be the inciting event but 
might develop later in the course of IBD and contribute to disease progression and 
chronicity. Studies of next-generation probiotics and larger controlled FMT trials could 
provide proof-of-concept in support of this notion.
Alternatively, it is possible that the gut microbiota have a critical role in the initiation of 
disease but that the window for such an effect occurs early in life. Concurrent with 
industrialization, the incidence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has risen globally, 
revealing a number of important associations between early life exposures and IBD13. Thus, 
birth by caesarean section, childhood exposure to antibiotics, use of infant formula, and 
residence in a sanitized environment have emerged as risk factors for the development of 
IBD and other immune-mediated diseases13. Conversely, childhood exposure to house dust 
in a rural setting is protective against the development of asthma, providing a cogent 
example of this principal182. Moreover, mouse models in which the gut microbiota are 
altered in early life phenocopy the associations with diseases observed in humans183,184. 
Although it might be difficult to demonstrate efficacy of a microbiota-based strategy for 
disease prevention, such an approach could be enourmously impactful, making it worth the 
investment in time, energy and resources.
In conclusion, we believe that association studies, animal models and early therapeutic trials 
collectively point to an important role of the gut microbiota and their metabolites in IBD 
pathogenesis. Translating these insights into viable therapeutic approaches might be 
challenging and require an investment in human subject research to definitively demonstrate 
cause–effect relation ships. Nevertheless, given the growing incidence of IBD worldwide 
and its association with environmental triggers, research into the gut microbiota with an eye 
towards therapeutics will be critically important.

Limitations of current IBD microbiome research in humans
•
Wide clinical spectrum of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease cannot be 
captured in single studies
•
Many microbial taxa are fastidious and difficult to culture
•
Microbiome studies have focused on bacteria with relatively little known 
about other microorganisms, including fungi and viruses, as well as how they 
interact with each other
•
Microbiota composition is markedly different between faecal and mucosal 
samples, yet most analyses of microbiome communities have been based on 
faecal samples Most studies focus on microbiota composition rather than 
function
•
Most studies characterize the gut microbiota using 16S ribosomal RNA 
tagged sequencing rather than shotgun metagenomics with deep sequencing 
to provide strain-level taxonomic classifications
•
Microbiome studies in IBD are confounded by treatment interventions and the 
effects of inflammation
•
Most published results are based on cross-sectional and not prospective 
longitudinal cohort studies

Limitations of current IBD mouse models
•
Most mouse models rely on gene knockouts, whereashuman risk alleles 
seldom lead to complete loss of function
•
Mouse models usually explore the effect of a single gene, whereas in humans 
there are often multiple alleles involved
•
Immune responses differ between mice and humans
•
Mice do not capture the genetic and environmental diversity of human 
populations
•
Mouse experiments fail to account for variables such as medication exposure, 
smoking and diet that are inherent in human research

Outstanding questions for the role of the gut microbiota in IBD
•
What are the very early events in IBD pathogenesis? Specifically, does 
dysbiosis precede the development of inflammation, or does inflammation 
arise independently of the microbiota and lead to dysbiosis?
•
Can microbiota testing be used as a reliable marker of disease onset and 
progression?
•
What are the antigens in the intestinal lumen that drive T-cell activation in 
IBD?
•
What is the best way to administer faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) 
with regards to patient selection, donor selection, and mode of 
administration?
•
What will be the long-term outcomes of FMT for IBD? Specifically, how 
durable will the effects be?
•
How can we refine microbial therapies beyond FMT? Can we re-engineer the 
microbiota of individual patients based on their specific disease phenotype, 
genetic makeup, and microbiome?
•
Can microbial-based therapies be used to prevent, rather than treat, IBD?
•
What is the role of the virome in IBD?

 Key points
•
Alterations in intestinal microbial composition have long been associated with 
chronic inflammation; however, a definitive cause–effect relationship between 
dysbiosis and IBD has been difficult to prove, especially in humans
•
Dysbiosis alters not only the composition of the intestinal microbiota, but also 
its metabolome, thereby exerting a wide range of effects on the host
•
While the microbiota plays a key pathogenic role in IBD, chronic 
inflammation, in turn, promotes dysbiosis by altering the oxidative and 
metabolic environment of the gut
•
Animal studies have elucidated key immunological pathways in the 
pathogenesis of IBD, established both pro-inflammatory and anti-
inflammatory roles of the gut microbiota, and shown that the gut microbiota is 
indispensable for pathogenesis in most colitis models
•
Microbial-based treatments will likely have a role in the future management 
of IBD; however, many questions remain regarding the bacterial composition, 
timing of administration, and patient selection for such therapies

 Figure 1. Colonic inflammation in IBD and link to the gut microbiota
Colonic inflammation stimulates IFNγ production, which generates reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) by phagocytic innate immune cells. These radicals eventually form products for 
anaerobic respiration. Facultative anaerobes utilize these products to outgrow, causing 
decreases in bacterial diversity. The dysbiotic microbiota might further encourage the 
outgrowth of fungi, especially Candida, which can in turn exacerbate inflammation via 
chitin and β -glucan antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation of the type 1 T helper (TH1) 
pathway. Similarly, the dysbiotic microbiota are associated with increased bacteriophage 
richness and abundance, which can in turn modify the bacterial microbiota via gene transfer.

 Figure 2. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of the gut gut microbiota
Pathogenic microorganisms are sensed via Toll-like receptors (TLR) and NOD-like receptors 
(NLR) on innate immune cells (dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages), Paneth cells and 
epithelial cells. This process leads to differentiation of type 17 T helper (TH17) cells and 
type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) under the influence of transforming growth factor 
(TGF)β, IL-6 and IL-1β, and activation of the IL-23 inflammatory pathway. TLR and NLR 
signalling also leads to NF-κB and inflammasome activation, secretion of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, and type 1 T helper (TH1) cell activation. Ultimately, these inflammatory 
responses lead to epithelial damage, loss of mucus-secreting goblet cells, and bacterial 
translocation, which further stimulates the inflammatory response. Anti-inflammatory 
bacteria are also sensed via TLR and NLR; however, this process leads to regulatory T 
(Treg)-cell differentiation via TGFβ, retinoic acid (RA) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 
(AhR) signalling. Treg cells exert their immunoregulatory function via IL-10 secretion. 
Moreover, NF-κB and inflammasome activation lead to secretion of anti-apoptotic factors 
and antimicrobial peptides, alongside recruitment of stromal and myeloid cells necessary for 
epithelial repair. Finally, IgA (produced by B cells) prevents colitogenic bacteria from 
penetrating the mucus layer.
