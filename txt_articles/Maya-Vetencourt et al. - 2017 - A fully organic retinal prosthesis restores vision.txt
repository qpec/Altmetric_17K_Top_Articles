 degenerative disorders. Here we report on the fabrication and functional validation of a fully 
organic prosthesis for long-term in vivo subretinal implantation in the eye of Royal College of 
Surgeons rats, a widely recognized model of Retinitis pigmentosa. Electrophysiological and 
behavioral analyses reveal a prosthesis-dependent recovery of light-sensitivity and visual acuity 
that persists up to 6-10 months after surgery. The rescue of the visual function is accompanied by 
an increase in the basal metabolic activity of the primary visual cortex, as demonstrated by 
positron emission tomography imaging. Our results highlight the possibility of developing a new 
generation of fully organic, highly biocompatible and functionally autonomous photovoltaic 
prostheses for subretinal implants to treat degenerative blindness.
The progressive degeneration of retinal photoreceptors due to single mutations in any of over 
240 identified genes (RetNet, Retinal Information Network) is one of the major causes of 
adult blindness in humans 1,2. Among these pathologies, Retinitis pigmentosa, a collective 
name for a set of genetic disorders that cause death of photoreceptors, afflicts 1 person in 
every 4,000 worldwide 3 and has no effective clinical treatment thus far.
A variety of therapeutic approaches have been developed in animal models of retinal 
degenerative diseases 4–8. Numerous research groups attempted to promote the 
reinstatement of vision by electrically stimulating residual neuronal circuitries in the 
degenerate retina using prosthetic implants in epiretinal 9,10, subretinal 11–14, or 
suprachoroidal 15 configuration. Encouraging results from clinical trials using these systems 
have been recently reported 16–19 [for review see 20,21]. However, most of the prostheses 
face various limitations that include the mechanical mismatch with soft retinal tissues, as 
well as the complexity of the manufacturing process and operational principles. Moreover, 
they often require trans-ocular cables to connect with an external wireless receiver and 
electrical stimulator, and/or an external image-capturing camera, that further limit the 
tolerability of the prosthetic approach.
Recently, an epiretinal prosthesis with an intraocular wireless receiver and stimulator was 
reported 22. Despite powering only a limited number of electrodes, which restricts spatial 
resolution, this approach avoids the necessity of using a trans-scleral cable. A second step 
overcoming the current limitations of retinal prostheses was achieved by the development of 
a new concept of photovoltaic stimulation 12–14. In this configuration, infrared light 
entering the pupil is converted into electrical stimuli delivered to the retina without the need 
of implanted electronics or physical connection with external devices. The major issue of 
such an approach is however the low sensitivity that essentially hampers the application at 
daylight illumination.
In the framework of photovoltaic retinal prosthesis, we recently introduced organic 
conjugated polymers (CPs) as interfaces for neuronal photostimulation 23–26. The use of 
CPs to manufacture subretinal prostheses offers several advantages as compared to 
previously reported approaches, namely multiple photo-stimulation mechanisms, including 
photovoltaic functioning, high biocompatibility, mechanical compliance, and sensitivity 
close to daylight range. In this work, we developed a fully organic device composed of a 
flexible and highly conformable silk substrate covered with photoactive layers of CPs and 
implanted it in the subretinal space of dystrophic Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats, a

 widely recognized model of Retinitis pigmentosa 27. The analysis of its efficacy in the 
recovery of visual functions revealed a significant and persistent prosthesis-induced rescue 
of vision in RCS dystrophic rats that lasted up to 6-10 months after implantation and was 
associated with a full structural and functional preservation of the opto-neural interface. 
These results highlight the potential clinical relevance of this fully organic prosthesis in 
retinal degenerative blindness.
Subretinal implant of the organic prosthesis in RCS rats
We fabricated a fully organic multi-layered device composed of a superficial semiconductive 
layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), an intermediate conductive layer of poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and a silk fibroin (SILK) 
layer (average thickness, 30 μm) as a passive substrate. The dimension, shape, and 
multilayer structure of the prosthesis are shown in Figure 1a (upper and lower panels). The 
PEDOT:PSS and P3HT layers were sequentially spin-coated on crystallized SILK from 
Bombyx Mori cocoons (see Methods). The device was cut in shape and size suitable for 
implantation by a laser-assisted technique. To verify the specificity of the CP-based interface 
and rule out secondary effects on the retina due to the implant per se, we manufactured a 
silk-only device with the same procedure, geometry and dimensions of the full device, but 
lacking the thin polymeric films (average total thickness, 800 nm).
The prosthetic device was implanted in the subretinal space of 2-3 months-old dystrophic 
RCS rats, as previously described 28,29. At this age, RCS rats already show marked 
impairments in both light sensitivity and spatial acuity, as assessed both 
electrophysiologically 30 and behaviorally 31. The SILK-PEDOT:PSS-P3HT prosthesis was 
implanted in the temporal hemi-retina of anesthetized animals, taking care to place it 
between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the retina 
(Fig. 1b). Near-infrared retinographies obtained by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy 
(cSLO) were used to localize the prosthetic device, evaluate the retinal coverage 
(approximately 10-15 %) and determine its relationship with the inner retina at both 30 and 
180 days post-implant (DPI). The distance between the implant and the optic nerve was used 
to verify the centrality of the device within the fundus (Fig. 1c). Analysis by means of 
optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed that the retina remained well attached over 
the entire area of the implant during the follow-up period (Fig. 1d). Retinal integrity was 
seen above and around the implant and no swelling or delamination effects of the device 
were observed (Fig. 1e,f). This is in agreement with previous observations that the implant 
in normal rats elicited a modest and transient inflammatory reaction that decreased soon 
after surgery with full preservation of retinal morphology 28,29.
Rescue of the pupillary reflex
As an initial evaluation of the device performance, we used the pupillary light reflex (PLR). 
This subcortical response can be considered an index of light sensitivity, as it reflects the 
complementary function of the rod-cone system and the melanopsin-associated system 32. 
We evaluated the PLR in bilaterally implanted, dark-adapted animals at 30 DPI using light 
stimuli of increasing intensity (1-30 Lux). This response is largely reduced in degenerative

 retinal diseases. Indeed, the percentage of pupil constriction (Fig. 2a) was largely impaired 
in dystrophic RCS rats with respect to non-dystrophic RCS-rdy controls at all irradiation 
intensities tested (Fig. 2b). In contrast, age-matched implanted dystrophic RCS rats at 30 
DPI (Supplementary Movie 1) fully recovered the pupillary response to levels 
indistinguishable from non-dystrophic controls at irradiation intensities > 2 Lux. This 
indicates that the prosthesis renders the retina of RCS dystrophic rats sensitive to light.
Topographic specificity of the prosthesis-generated signals at the cortical 
level
We next focused our attention on the response to light at the cortical level. We assessed the 
specificity of the electrical signal driven by the implanted prosthesis in the primary visual 
cortex (V1) at 30 DPI by recording visual evoked potentials (VEPs) driven by flashes of 
light (20 cd/m2; 100 ms). Particular care was taken in positioning the subretinal implant 
unilaterally in the temporal hemi-retina of RCS rats. Considering the anatomy of the rat 
retinal projections to V1 33, it can be predicted that the prosthesis-generated electrical 
signals, after unilateral placement of the device in the temporal hemiretina, are only 
observed in the binocular region of V1 (Oc1b) ipsilateral to the implant (Fig. 2c; light 
green). Accordingly, the amplitude of the cortical response measured in the ipsilateral Oc1b 
after binocular visual stimulation was nearly 3-fold higher than the amplitude recorded in 
the contralateral Oc1b (Fig. 2d). The former signal was also significantly larger than that 
observed in the monocular areas of the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex. As such, the 
observed light-driven electrical signal at cortical level topographically corresponds to the 
light-dependent activation of the inner retina circuitry harboring the prosthesis and is not 
attributable to a trophic effect of the implant and/or of its electrical activity on the adjacent 
retina, as previously reported 11,34–36.
Recovery of visual cortical responses
To quantitatively evaluate the extent of visual function restoration, we assessed light 
sensitivity in bilaterally implanted dystrophic RCS rats at 30 and 180 DPI using 
electrophysiological recordings of VEPs in Oc1b of V1 (Fig. 3a). We measured the 
amplitude of the V1 response evoked by flash stimuli (20 cd/m2; 100 ms) of low temporal 
frequency (0.5 Hz), as previously described 37,38. A substantial recovery of light sensitivity 
was observed in implanted RCS rats at 30 DPI. As shown in Figure 3b and Supplementary 
Figure 1, the amplitude of the V1 response in non-implanted dystrophic RCS animals was 
nearly 2.5-fold lower as compared to non-dystrophic RCS-rdy controls. Notably, implanted 
age-matched dystrophic RCS rats showed a cortical response at 30 DPI that was higher in 
amplitude than that observed in either non-implanted (see above) or sham-implanted 
dystrophic RCS animals. A persistent rescue of light sensitivity (+71.6%) similar to the 
extent of the recovery at 30 DPI (+62.3%) was observed at 180 DPI in implanted RCS rats 
(Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 2). The overall lower VEP amplitude observed in 9-months old 
control and dystrophic RCS rats (the age corresponding to 180 DPI) is in agreement with the 
progressive photoreceptor loss that these pink-eyed RCS rats display over their life span, as 
previously reported 39. Notably, a smaller cohort of animals examined at 300 DPI still

 revealed a significant two fold-increase in the VEP amplitude in implanted RCS rats with 
respect to either non-implanted or sham-implanted RCS rats (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Much like the reduction in the amplitude of the VEP signal, an increase in the time of VEP 
latency, can be ascribed to a functional alteration of the retinal circuitries 40. In line with 
this, we observed a significant increase of the VEP latency in dystrophic RCS animals as 
compared to non-dystrophic RCS-rdy rats at both 30 and 180 DPI (Supplementary Fig. 4). 
This phenomenon matches the progression of photoreceptor degeneration and retinal 
rewiring causing the gradual decrease of vision in our experimental model. Interestingly, the 
longer VEP latency in dystrophic RCS animals was not rescued by the implant with respect 
to either non-implanted or sham implanted RCS-rdy controls at both 30 and 180 DPI, further 
excluding the existence of a trophic effect of the implant on the adjacent retina.
We next shifted our attention to the spatial resolution. Measures of visual acuity were 
obtained by recording VEPs in Oc1b of V1 (Fig. 3a) in response to patterned visual stimuli 
(20 cd/m2; 0.5 Hz) of varying spatial frequency (0.1 to 1 cycle/degree), as previously 
described 37,38. A significant recovery of spatial resolution was observed in implanted RCS 
rats at 30 DPI. As shown in Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure 5, spatial acuity in non-
implanted RCS rats was markedly lower than that of non-dystrophic RCS-rdy controls. On 
the contrary, age-matched implanted RCS animals displayed a significant 2-fold 
enhancement of visual acuity at 30 DPI as compared to either non-implanted (see above) or 
sham-implanted RCS dystrophic animals. The rescue of visual acuity in implanted RCS rats 
at 180 DPI (+96.7%) was again closely similar to the effect observed at 30 DPI (+91.9%; 
Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 6). Interestingly, a high correlation was found between gain in 
visual acuity and the goodness of prosthesis placement as determined by OCT analysis in a 
sub-group of the animals evaluated at 30 and 180 DPI (Supplementary Fig. 7; n=8 per 
group).
Recovery of visually driven behavior
The next step was to assess vision in bilaterally implanted RCS rats at 30 and 180 DPI using 
the light-dark box test as a light-driven behavioral trial (Fig. 4a). This analysis relies on the 
innate aversion of nocturnal rodents to brightly illuminated areas 41. Two parameters, 
namely the latency of escape from the illuminated area to darkness and the percentage of 
time spent in the dark using a 5-lux light intensity, were computed as an index of light 
sensitivity. As expected (Fig. 4b), non-implanted RCS animals displayed a longer latency 
than non-dystrophic RCS-rdy controls. In contrast, implanted dystrophic RCS animals at 30 
DPI showed a significant recovery in the latency of escape as compared to either non-
implanted or sham-implanted RCS rats, reaching levels indistinguishable from RCS-rdy 
controls (Supplementary Movie 2). The rescue in the escape latency in implanted RCS rats 
was fully preserved over time and still significant at 180 DPI (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Movie 
3).
We also evaluated the time spent in the dark over the duration of the test. As shown in Figure 
4d, the percentage of time spent in the dark compartment by dystrophic RCS animals was 
significantly lower compared to non-dystrophic RCS-rdy controls. Conversely, implanted 
Maya-Vetencourt et al.

 RCS rats at 30 DPI spent significantly more time in the dark than either non-implanted or 
sham-implanted RCS animals. The recovery of the time in the dark was fully preserved up to 
180 DPI. No difference in the number of light-dark transitions was detected at either 30 or 
180 DPI (Supplementary Figure 8), testifying that the experimental groups had a similar 
motor activity.
Enhancement of basal metabolic activity in V1
We finally evaluated V1 metabolic activation in RCS rats at both 30 and 180 DPI by 
utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging after intravenous injection of 
the glucose analogue 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG). This tracer enters neuronal cells 
according to their glucose consumption, it is phosphorylated by hexokinase and accumulates 
within the cytosol being a false substrate for the enzymes directing glucose-6P to glycolysis 
42. Imaging of regional brain uptake thus provides a three-dimensional map of brain glucose 
consumption permitting us to estimate the metabolic activity of V1 43 identified by a 
specific volume of interest (VOI). Average standardized uptake values (SUV) were 
calculated to perform analysis of V1 activation, as previously described 44. All experiments 
were performed in an environment with a light intensity of 5 lux. The 18F-FDG uptake in V1 
VOI in the four experimental groups at 30 and 180 DPI is shown in Figure 5a,b. Dystrophic 
RCS animals at 30 DPI showed a significantly lower average SUV in V1 with respect to 
age-matched non-dystrophic RCS-rdy controls (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, the presence of the 
prosthesis was associated with a significant increase in average SUV as compared to those 
observed in either non-implanted (see above) or sham-implanted RCS animals. When 
analyzed at 180 DPI, control and dystrophic RCS rats displayed an overall age-dependent 
decrease in SUV, consistent with the lower amplitude of VEP signals. However, the 
significant improvement in SUV was fully preserved over time in implanted dystrophic RCS 
rats and still significant at 180 DPI (Fig. 5d). Indeed, at this late time point, the average SUV 
in implanted RCS rats was still significantly higher than that measured in non-implanted or 
sham-implanted dystrophic RCS rats and virtually indistinguishable from the values 
observed in non-dystrophic RCS-rdy controls. These findings reveal a substantial and long-
term rescue of basal metabolic activity in the visual cortex of dystrophic rats implanted with 
the retinal device.
The long-lasting rescue of visual functions is not due to a trophic effect
To unambiguously demonstrate that long-lasting rescue of visual functions was not 
attributable to a trophic effect of the implant and/or of the electrical activity on the adjacent 
retina, we performed histochemical studies in control and implanted retinas 6 months after 
surgical implantation (Supplementary Figs. 9-11). The analysis was carried out on retinal 
sections (from dorsal to ventral) that included the optic disc that were collected after 6 
months from surgery or at same age in control groups. Bisbenzimide nuclear labeling of 
retinal sections confirmed that, by the time of our analysis, all RCS animals, no matter they 
were not implanted, sham-implanted or implanted with the full device, completely lost 
almost all photoreceptors both in the implanted region and in the remaining retina, with no 
difference in the ratio between total and inner nuclear layer thicknesses (Supplementary Fig. 
9). In addition, non-implanted RCS rats as well as RCS rats implanted with either the full

 device or the sham silk-only scaffold at 180 DPI showed similar expression levels of 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) mainly produced by Muller cells (Supplementary Fig. 10). 
Moreover, while both GFAP-positive astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 10) and IBA-1 positive 
microglial cells (Supplementary Fig. 11) were increased, as a result of the ongoing 
degeneration, in RCS retinas with respect to non-dystrophic retinas, the presence of the full 
device or of the silk-only scaffold did not significantly alter their proliferation with respect 
to age-matched non-implanted RCS rats.
The properties of the device are preserved after long-term subretinal 
implantation
The long-lasting rescue of visual functions induced by the prosthesis indicates that the 
organic device is likely to be intact and active after months of implantation, despite the 
continuous exposure to biological fluids, body temperature and inflammatory cells. To 
demonstrate that, we performed structural, biophysical and electrophysiological analyses of 
post-mortem prostheses excised 6 months after implantation (Fig. 6). Analysis of the excised 
devices by light and fluorescence microscopy revealed that the prosthesis was intact and still 
covered by the fluorescent P3HT layer (Fig. 6a,b). Also, SEM analysis of the prosthesis still 
embedded in the tissue revealed that the device was intact and in contact with the inner 
retina, with no apparent delamination (Fig. 6c,d). Analysis by SEM of the top and bottom 
surfaces of the device after dissection of the overlying retina revealed a completely different 
surface texture (Fig. 6e,f). The P3HT-covered surface was much smoother and uniform than 
the corresponding silk-only sham implant, consistent with the low roughness of P3HT 
coating 45. Next, Raman spectroscopy was used to test the irreversible chemical degradation 
of the polymer layers, typically breaking the conjugation along the chain bleaching the 
absorption (Fig. 6g). We focused on the 1350-1500 cm-1 region, which corresponds to the 
carbon stretching modes. Upon excitation at 532 nm, two main peaks assigned to P3HT are 
observed at 1448 and 1380 cm-1 46. The PEDOT:PSS Raman modes at 1431 and 1369 cm-1 
are also visible, as expected 47. Optoelectronic measurements completed the post-mortem 
analysis of the devices. A patch-clamp electrode positioned in close proximity of the P3HT/
electrolyte interface was used to record the transient changes in the surface potential of the 
polymer layer evoked by illumination in devices explanted after 6 months in vivo or aged 
under ambient conditions in the dark (Fig. 6h). Notably, the explanted device still displayed 
a fast signal occurring in the first few ms after photo-excitation, which has been previously 
attributed to the capacitive charging of the polymer/electrolyte interface 25. These data 
demonstrate that both P3HT and PEDOT:PSS are still present and preserve their original 
properties after long-term implantation, with no evidence of any irreversible chemical 
degradation.
We report a fully organic, highly biocompatible, functionally autonomous, photosensitive 
prosthesis that rescues light sensitivity and spatial acuity in dystrophic RCS animals up to 10 
months after implantation. The use of CPs, and more generally of organic materials, 
represents an innovation in the field of retinal prosthetic devices that might lead to a 
performance breakthrough. This experimental approach illustrates the possibility to work 
without implanted metal- or silicon-based electronics, thereby avoiding the need for power

 supply or external cameras. The prosthesis sensitivity corresponds to irradiances that fall 
within daylight illumination levels 24, configuring a fully autonomous device, flexible to 
allow wide retina coverage, and with properties that are conserved over time in the presence 
of biological fluids. Moreover, the highly localized CP response to light with a space 
constant of < 50 μm 23,24 produces a spatial resolution that is at least comparable to, if not 
higher than, that achieved by previous approaches using microelectrode or photodiode arrays 
of fixed, discrete geometries.
The restoration of visual functions induced by the prosthesis at distinct stages of disease 
progression in RCS rats suggests that this strategy may be of clinical relevance in both the 
early and late phases of the pathology. The strong correlation between the recovery of visual 
acuity and the presence of the polymeric layers, and the substantially unaffected progression 
of retinal degeneration, demonstrate that the rescue of visual activity directly relies on the 
properties of the organic device and is not attributable to secondary trophic effects of the 
implant.
The results indicate that light-stimulated CPs directly activate residual neuronal circuitries in 
the degenerate retina. However, the detailed principle of operation of the prosthesis remains 
uncertain. We conjecture it depends on the photo-generation of long-lived excited states, 
namely polarons, in the polymer layer and the subsequent interaction of such states with the 
retina environment. We recently demonstrated that illumination induces highly localized 
effects at the organic/electrolyte interface that include capacitive charging 23,24, photo-
thermal effects 25,26 and photo-electrochemical reactions 48. The capacitive charging of the 
interface requires the presence of a conductive anode (PEDOT:PSS) to collect holes 
generated by photon absorption and accumulate negative charges at the polymer/water 
interface48. Light absorption by the polymer also leads to the generation of various photo-
excited states that non-radiatively recombine to the ground state by locally releasing thermal 
energy. Both effects were demonstrated to modulate retinal activity in a time-dependent 
manner 24,26, although the thermal effect is unlikely to be involved in vivo, since the energy 
levels involved, and the corresponding temperature increases, are much smaller as compared 
to in vitro experiments. The photoinduced accumulation of surface negative charge (p-type 
semiconducting behavior) may lead to local ion redistribution, possibly causing a 
progressive acidification of the solution in the close proximity of the P3HT surface 48. This 
could be an additional stimulus for the excitation of bipolar cells and/or RGCs that express 
acid-sensing ion channels 49.
Our results validate the use of organic semiconductors as functional materials in 
biocompatible and implantable devices. The study is the first in vivo and long-term 
application of an interface for neuronal photo-stimulation entirely made of organic CPs. This 
work demonstrates the far reaching potential of the bioorganic approach in material science 
as recently discussed 50. We use here an organic semiconductor that is typically used for 
photovoltaics. From photophysics to photobiology, the device exploits the transducing 
capability of the biotic/abiotic interface established by the polymer film with the retina inner 
cell layers. The significant rescue of visual functions that we found in an animal model of 
blindness due to photoreceptor degeneration makes worth investigating the effects of this 
novel prosthesis in human patients afflicted by degenerative blindness.

Ethical approval and animal handling
All animal manipulations and procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines 
established by the European Community Council (Directive 2012/63/EU of 22 September 
2010) and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (Authorization # 645/2015-PR). 
Royal College of Surgeons inbred, pink-eyed dystrophic (RCS/LAV) animals, together with 
congenic non-dystrophic (RCS-rdy+/LAV) controls were kindly provided by dr. M.M. La 
Vail (Beckman Vision Center, University of California San Francisco, CA39. Rat colonies 
were bred under standard conditions with ad libitum access to food and water under a 12/12 
h light/dark cycle.
Preparation of silk substrates
Silk fibroin (SF) films were obtained from Bombyx Mori cocoons. Cocoons were cut into 
two parts and immersed in distilled water, then treated at 120 °C for 30 min, and finally 
rinsed six times with distilled water, previously heated at 60 °C to remove sericin from fibers 
(degumming). The degummed fibers were stored for 3 days in a drying room, at 20 ± 2 °C 
and relative humidity of 65 ± 2 %. They were then dissolved in a saturated lithium bromide 
(LiBr) solution inside a hermetically closed flask, and treated at 60 ± 2 °C for 3 h. The 
solution was then dissolved in distilled water, pre-heated at 60 °C and filtered. Dialysis was 
carried out to completely remove LiBr: the solution was poured into preconditioned 
cellulose tubes immersed in distilled water and continuously mechanically agitated. The 
solution was changed every 8 h for 3 days. Finally, the purified SF was filtered and drop-
casted on Teflon Petri dishes. After 2 days, SF films (200 cm2 area and 30 μm approximate 
thickness) were ready for the subsequent preparation steps.
Microfabrication of the organic retinal prosthesis
Prior to deposition of organic layers, SF thin films were sequentially rinsed in an ultrasonic 
bath with pure acetone and isopropanol for 7 min each. The temperature of the bath was 
carefully monitored and kept under 37 °C. After each rinse, substrates were gently dried 
using a nitrogen gun. Organic layers were deposited on the side in contact with the Teflon 
Petri dish during SF casting. PEDOT:PSS was used without further purification. A water 
dispersion was prepared by adding the following additives: the co-solvent dimethylsulfoxide 
(DMSO, 9% v/v) to increase the overall electrical conductivity; the cross-linker 3-
glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS, 0.9 % v/v) to enhance the adhesion of the 
PEDOT:PSS layer to the substrate and avoid delamination; the surfactant Zonyl FS-300 
(0.18% v/v) to promote dispersion wettability and facilitate the spin-coating process. In 
particular, GOPS, by acting as a crosslinking and adhesion agent, rendered PEDOT:PSS 
virtually water-insoluble, as shown by the fact that the volume increase during swelling 
passes from 155% to 35% 51. PEDOT:PSS dispersion including additives was then 
sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min and cooled at room temperature. PEDOT:PSS 
dispersion was deposited by spin coating in two identical steps, by properly adjusting the 
rotation parameters (rotation speed 2000 rpm, duration 60 s). The double deposition was 
required to limit the dynamic interaction between the PEDOT:PSS dispersion and the 
underlying SF film (that could lead to structural modifications and permeation of the

 substrate by the solvent), and to yield a uniform layer. Between the first and the second 
deposition, and after the second deposition, the substrates underwent a thermal annealing 
process in air (120 °C, 10 min). Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT, 15,000-45,000 molecular 
weight) was used without further purification. The P3HT solution in chlorobenzene (30 g/l) 
was sonicated for more than 1 h and deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by a two-
steps spin coating process (800 rpm, 5 s; 1600 rpm, 120 s). A final thermal annealing in 
glove box (120 °C, 20 min) completed the fabrication of large area devices (approximately 2 
x 2 cm). From the large multilayer foil, retinal implants of dimensions suitable for 
implantation in rats were obtained through the step of laser-assisted cutting. The laser source 
was a regeneratively amplified diode-pumped mode-locked Yb:KGW laser with emission at 
1030 nm, repetition rate of 500 KHz and pulse width of 240 fs. The second harmonic beam, 
generated by a HIRO harmonics generator, was focused onto the polymer-coated SF 
substrates, with incidence from the substrate side. Pulse energy, in the order of 200 nJ, was 
adjusted to get a relatively sharp cut of the edges, without causing degradation to the 
optoelectronic properties of the active material. Samples were mounted on a three-axis 
motorized translation stage, and translation speed was set to 0.4 mm/s. The cut was repeated 
three times to ensure an easy detachment of the sample from the support glass. The 
prosthesis has a trapezoid geometry, with dimensions suited to implantation in the rat 
subretinal space, namely 1.8 mm height, 1.1 mm and 0.55 mm parallel sides. Edges were 
intentionally smoothed during the laser-assisted fabrication to limit mechanical damage to 
retinal layers during surgery.
Sham SF-only devices were treated exactly as devices coated with conjugated polymers 
(P3HT and PEDOT:PSS). They were obtained from SF substrates fabricated and treated by 
using the very same protocol. Sham devices underwent the thermal treatments used in the 
PEDOT:PSS and P3HT annealing protocols, and were cut using the same laser procedure, 
obtaining trapezoidal shapes 1.8 mm in height and 1.1 mm and 0.55 mm parallel sides. After 
fabrication and prior to implantation, all samples were subjected to ethylene oxide 
sterilization.
Surgical procedures
Two/three month-old RCS rats of either sex were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal 
injection of diazepam (10 mg/kg) followed by intramuscular administration of xylazine (5 
mg/kg) and ketamine (33 mg/kg). The sub-retinal implant of the prosthesis was carried out 
as indicated below. Briefly, a 1.5 mm peritomy was made 2 mm posterior to the limbus, 
followed by a limbus-parallel incision through the sclera and choroid of approximately 1 
mm. The retina was then gently detached from the choroid using a custom-designed spatula. 
Viscoelastic material was injected into the subretinal space and the device was inserted with 
the polymeric coating facing the retina. The edges of the sclerotomy were electrocoagulated 
and the conjunctiva apposed. Surgical procedures were carried out in a sterile room using a 
Leica ophthalmic surgical microscope. During the whole procedure, the rat eyes were kept 
wet. At the end of the surgical intervention, the position of the device was evaluated by 
indirect ophthalmoscopy. Topical application of antibiotic and cortisone to the eyes was 
performed to prevent inflammation of infection after the surgical procedure.

 In vivo imaging of the retinal implant
Rats were anaesthetized with isofluorane (3% induction; 2% maintenance in oxygen) and 
their pupils dilated with 1% tropicamide eye drops before image acquisition. Confocal 
scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) was performed with a commercially available 
scanning-laser ophthalmoscope. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed using 
the Spectralis™ HRA/OCT device. Each two-dimensional B-Scan recorded at 30° field of 
view consisted of 1536 A-Scans were acquired at a speed of 40,000 scans/s. Imaging was 
performed using the proprietary software package Eye Explorer (version 3.2.1.0). The 
combination of laser scanning retinal imaging and OCT allowed a real-time tracking of eye 
movements and real-time averaging of OCT scans, thus reducing speckle noise in the OCT 
images considerably.
Pupillary Reflex
Direct pupillary light reflex was assayed 30 DPI or age-matched RCS and RCS-rdy animals. 
Following dark-adaptation for at least 1h, awake rats were manually held with the eye to be 
recorded perpendicular to an infrared sensitive camera fitted with Leica macro lens. Animals 
were subjected to a 2 s dim green light exposure of ascending irradiance provided by an 
LED source (515 nm) through the same macro lens. Sequential images were captured with a 
Hamamatsu camera at a 5 Hz frame rate. Background illumination was provided by an 
infrared LED source (850 nm) throughout the experiment. At least 10 min elapsed between 
exposures, during which time the animal was unrestrained in dark. Subsequently, pupil area 
was determined from individual video frames before and after light exposure. To facilitate 
comparisons, pupil areas (ai) were expressed relative to the dilated area immediately prior to 
each exposure (a0). The effective intensity of each exposure was measured with a lux meter.
In vivo electrophysiology
Animals implanted with the prosthesis at either 30 or 180 DPI were anesthetized with 
isofluorane (3% induction; 2% maintenance in oxygen) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. 
Anesthesia level was stable throughout the experiment and body temperature was 
continuously monitored and maintained at ~37 °C by a thermostatic electric blanket. An 
ECG was continuously monitored. A hole was drilled in the skull, corresponding to the 
binocular portion of the primary visual cortex (Oc1B). After exposure of the brain surface, 
the dura mater was gently removed, and a micropipette (2 MΩ) filled with NaCl (3 M) was 
inserted into the cortex 5 mm from λ (intersection between the sagittal and the lambdoid 
sutures). Both eyes were fixed, kept wet, and open along the analysis by means of adjustable 
metal rings surrounding the external portion of the eye bulb. We measured both light 
sensitivity and visual acuity using visual evoked potentials (VEPs), as described before 
37,38,52. During recording through one eye, the other was covered by a black adhesive tape. 
To prevent sampling bias, VEPs were recorded at three distinct penetrations within Oc1b, at 
100 μm and 400 μm depths for each penetration. Signals were band-pass-filtered (0.1–100 
Hz), amplified, and fed to a computer for analysis, as described previously 53. In the case of 
light sensitivity, visual stimuli were flashes of light (20 cd m-2; 100 ms), whereas in the case 
of spatial acuity, visual stimuli were horizontal sinusoidal gratings of increasing spatial 
frequencies (0.1 to 1 cycle/ degree of visual angle) at 0.5 Hz. All visual stimuli were

 generated by a VSG2/2 card running custom software, presented on a monitor (20 x 22 cm 
area; 100% of contrast) positioned 20 cm from the rat’s eyes, and centered on the previously 
determined receptive fields. Light sensitivity corresponded to the amplitude of the VEP 
response to flashes of light. Visual acuity was obtained by extrapolation to zero amplitude of 
the linear regression through the last four to five data points of VEP amplitude versus the log 
spatial frequency.
Light-dark box test
The light-dark test is a light-driven behavioral analysis based on the innate aversion of 
nocturnal rodents to brightly illuminated areas 41. The test was used as an index of light 
sensitivity in all experimental groups at either 30 or 180 DPI. The trials were performed in a 
two-compartment box consisting of a "light" compartment and a "dark" compartment 
communicating through a small door (Fig. 4A) and positioned in an experimental room kept 
under dark conditions. Animals were dark-adapted for 30 min. Soon (30 sec) after 
introducing the animal in the "light" compartment, illumination with a 5-lux intensity was 
switched on. Six min-video recordings were performed to monitor the latency of escape 
from the illuminated area and the percentage of time spent in each compartment. The 
number of transitions between the two compartments was also monitored and used as an 
index of light-independent motor activity.
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
Rats were kept under fasting conditions with free access to water for 6 h under the same 
artificial light. Rats were weighted and anesthesia was induced by intra-peritoneal 
administration of diazepam (4 mg/kg) followed by intramuscular administration of 
ketamine/xylazine (5 mg/kg and 33 mg/kg, respectively). Serum glucose level was tested 
soon before the injection of 37-74 MBq 18F-FDG through the tail vein. Animals were 
maintained under the same light conditions (5 lux) for 40 min and then positioned on the bed 
of a dedicated micro-PET system to undergo a scan acquisition of 600 sec. PET data were 
reconstructed using a maximal likelihood expectation maximization method (MLEM). An 
experienced observer in double blind conditions identified a volume of interest (VOI) in the 
primary visual cortex (V1; ~1 mm3) using stereotaxic coordinates 43, to measure the 
average standardized uptake value (SUV). This value represents the most commonly 
accepted index of 18F-FDG retention and represents tracer uptake as the fraction of injected 
tracer dose normalized for body weight 54.
Histology and immunohistochemistry of the retina
The study was carried out on retinal sections (from dorsal to ventral) that included the optic 
disc and that were collected after 6 months from surgery or at same age in control groups. 
Experimental animals were euthanized with CO2 at appropriate times and the dorsal part of 
the eye was marked with an indelible marker by a stitch in the conjunctiva. Eyes were 
enucleated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 
6 h, extensively washed in 0.1 M PBS, and cryoprotected by equilibration with 10% and 
20% sucrose and overnight incubation in 30% sucrose. Eyes were embedded in the 
compound optimum cutting temperature (Tissue-Tek; Qiagen, Valencia, CA), snap frozen in 
liquid nitrogen/isopentane, and cryosectioned at 20 μm using a Leica CM1850 cryostat

 (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with the eyes oriented so that the sections extended from the 
superior to the inferior edge. Sections were mounted on gelatin and poly-L-lysine-coated 
slides and stained with bisbenzimide (1:10,000; Hoechst) for 1 min at room temperature 
(RT) to evaluate the position of the implant and retina layers. To block nonspecific binding 
in immunohistochemistry experiments, 0.75% horse serum for FGF2 and GFAP and 10% 
goat serum for IBA1 were used. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse 
monoclonal FGF2 antibody (1:200 in 0.75% horse serum; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake 
Placid, NY), rabbit polyclonal IBA1 (1:1000 in 1% goat serum; Wako Pure Chemical 
Industries, Japan) and rabbit polyclonal GFAP (1:5000 in 0.75% horse serum; 
DakoCytomation, Campbellfield, Australia). Secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG 
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 
CA) for IBA1 and GFAP and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular 
Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for FGF2, were diluted 1:200 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 
h. Retinal sections were acquired by using a Nikon 80i confocal microscope. Morphometric 
analysis was performed on 2/3 animals per each experimental group by imaging and 
analyzing two slices per retina and seven fields per slice, namely: 3 dorsal to the implant, 1 
in the region of the implant, and 3 ventral to the implant. Acquisition parameters were kept 
constant throughout all the imaging session for comparison purposes. Mean fluorescence 
intensity analysis for FGF2 and GFAP was performed using the ImageJ software. Iba1 cells 
were manually counted in each field.
Post-mortem characterization of implanted prostheses
Raman spectroscopy—Raman spectra were recorded by using a commercial Renishaw 
In Via Raman microscope in a back-scattering configuration, including a monochromator, 
notch filter system and a charge-coupled detector. Excitation wavelength: 532 nm. Samples 
were placed on the stage of a Leica microscope, equipped with 5x, 20x, 50x and 100x short 
and long working distance objectives. In all measurements, laser power intensity on the 
sample was kept at values lower than 0.03 mW in order to avoid laser-induced sample 
degradation. All measurements were carried out at room temperature.
Surface potential measurements—Surface potential measurements were performed 
with a patch-clamp setup (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments) coupled to an inverted 
microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti). A LED system (Lumencor Spectra X), fiber-coupled to the 
fluorescence port of the microscope, provided the light for the optical excitation of the 
devices. The samples were illuminated with 540 nm light pulses at photoexcitation density 
of 222 mW/mm2. The size of the light spot is 0.23 mm2. Recordings are carried out in 
voltage clamp configuration by micro-manipulating freshly pulled glass pipettes (3÷6 MΩ) 
in the close proximity (~ 2 μm) of the polymer-electrolyte interface. Both the pipette and the 
bath are filled with electrolytic Krebs-Ringers-Henseleit solution (KRH) to avoid junction 
potentials artifacts. The measured current is set to zero under dark conditions; surface 
potential is then calculated by multiplying the current trace measured upon illumination by 
the pipette resistance. All measurements were performed at room temperature. Acquisition 
was performed with pClamp 10 software suite (Axon Instruments) and all data were 
elaborated with Origin 8.0.

 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)—SEM imaging was performed post-mortem on 
retinas explanted and fixed from RCS rats 6 months after implant surgery and on the relative 
dissected prosthesis. CO2 anesthesia and cervical dislocation were performed to sacrifice the 
animals. The eye and retina dissection was realized under dim red light. Eyes were 
enucleated and transferred to carboxygenated Ames’ medium (Sigma Aldrich), where the 
cornea, lens and part of the vitreous were removed. The tissues were then fixed in 1.25 % 
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 1 % OsO4, 0.1 M sodium 
cacodylate, dehydrated, and cut into sections under a stereomicroscope. Imaging of the full 
and sham silk-only devices explanted from the animals and freed of tissue was also 
performed. The post-mortem preparations were coated with a 10 nm evaporated Au layer 
and observed with a JEOL-7500 electron microscope (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means ± sem, with n as the number of independent animals (n).

patterned illumination.
(a-c) VEP recordings in V1 (a) in response to flash stimuli (20 cd m-2; 100 ms) show the 
rescue of light sensitivity in implanted RCS rats at both 30 DPI (b) and 180 DPI (c). The 
mean (±sem) amplitudes of the V1 response at 30 DPI were: RCS-rdy, 253.4 ± 12.3 μV 
(n=8); RCS, 102.8 ± 7.5 μV (n=8); RCS+Implant, 167.0 ± 21.1 μV (n=7); RCS+Substrate, 
107.2 ± 8.2 μV (n=7). The mean (±sem) amplitudes of the V1 response at 180 DPI were: 
RCS-rdy, 23.0 ± 1.05 μV (n=8); RCS, 9.54 ± 1.05 μV (n=8); RCS+Implant, 16.38 ± 1.02 μV 
(n=8); RCS+Substrate, 11.38 ± 0.73 μV (n=8). (d, e) The electrophysiological analysis of 
VEP recordings in response to horizontal sinusoidal gratings of increasing spatial 
frequencies (0.1 to 1 cycle/ degree of visual angle) administered at 0.5 Hz reveals a 
significant recovery of visual acuity at both 30 DPI (d) and 180 DPI (e). The mean (±sem) 
spatial acuity values at 30 DPI were: RCS-rdy, 0.76 ± 0.02 cycles/degree (n=10); RCS, 0.32

(n=28). Mean (±sem) latencies at 180 DPI were: RCS-rdy, 15.86 ± 2.04 s (n=28); RCS, 
24.50 ± 1.57 s (n=38); RCS+Implant, 15.71 ± 1.86 s (n=21); RCS+Substrate, 27.84 ± 2.23 s 
(n=19). (d,e) Implanted animals also showed a significant increase in the time spent in the 
dark compartment at both 30 DPI (d) and 180 DPI (e). Mean (±sem) percentages of time 
spent in the dark at 30 DPI: RCS-rdy, 52.69 ± 2.56 % (n=46); RCS, 40.37 ± 1.76 % (n=41);

 Figure 5. Basal metabolic activity in V1.
(a, b) Representative images of basal metabolic activity acquired in all experimental groups 
at both 30 (a) and 180 DPI (b). The color-scale map corresponding to the average SUV 
of 18F-FDG uptake over the scanned area is shown on the left. Inset black boxes show the 
location of the analyzed average VOI in V1 (~1 mm3). (c, d) The quantitative analysis of the 
average SUV at 30 DPI (c) and 180 DPI (d), demonstrates a significant and persistent 
prosthesis-dependent increase in V1 basal metabolic activity. Mean (±sem) SUV values at 
30 DPI were: RCS-rdy, 3.05 ± 0.156 (n=7); RCS, 1.66 ± 0.157 (n=13); RCS+Implant, 2.17 
± 0.125 (n=16); RCS+Substrate, 1.81 ± 0.130 (n=8). Mean (±sem) SUV values at 180 DPI 
were: RCS-rdy, 1.792 ± 0.127 (n=7); RCS, 1.381 ± 0.053 (n=11); RCS+Implant, 1.624 
± 0.046 (n=14); RCS+Substrate, 1.330 ± 0.07 (n=8). One-way ANOVA/post-hoc Tukey's 
multiple comparison test: * 0.0001<p<0.05 (c); * 0.01<p<0.05 (d).

 Figure 6. Characterization of the prosthesis after long-term implantation.
(a) Optical image of a dissected retina with the prosthesis and its polymeric layer still in 
contact with the tissue. (b) Fluorescence image (excitation: 540 nm; emission: 605 nm) of 
the same prosthesis after removal of the tissue showing the preserved photoluminescence of 
the P3HT layer after in vivo implantation. (c, d) SEM image section view of a fixed retina 
where the prosthesis embedded in the tissue is clearly intact after 6 months of implantation; 
the magnified view of the area highlighted in yellow further confirms the complete 
confinement of the prosthesis in the subretinal space of the eye. (e, f) Representative, top-
view SEM images of the sham, silk-only (left) and full polymer (right) devices explanted 
from the rat retina 6 months after implantation and freed from the retinal tissues. The 
smooth surface of the full device testifies the persistence of the polymeric layer. (g) Raman 
spectra of prosthetic implants, extracted from the subretinal space of RCS rats 6 months 
after implantation. The resonances in the range 1350-1500 cm-1 (highlighted in the inset) 
demonstrate the presence and the preserved conjugation of the P3HT polymeric chains (red 
trace). The PEDOT:PSS signature in rare P3HT-free areas of the same device is also shown 
(green trace), confirming the absence of irreversible chemical degradation after implantation.

same amount of time at room temperature in the dark. The fast light-evoked capacitive peak 
at the light onset (t=0 ms) is preserved 10 months after implantation. The not-implanted 
device was kept in the dark at room temperature for the same period of time. Inset: 
schematics of the experimental set-up used to record the surface potential with a 
micropipette electrode micromanipulated in the very close proximity of the P3HT/
