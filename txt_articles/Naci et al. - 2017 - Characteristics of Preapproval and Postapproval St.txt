IMPORTANCE Drugs treating serious or life-threatening conditions can receive US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) accelerated approval based on showing an effect in surrogate
measures that are only reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Confirmatory trials are
then required to determine whether these effects translate to clinical improvements.
OBJECTIVE To characterize preapproval and confirmatory clinical trials of drugs granted
accelerated approval.
DESIGN AND SETTING Publicly available FDA documents were reviewed to identify the
preapproval trials leading to accelerated approval between 2009 and 2013. Information on
the status and findings of required confirmatory studies was extracted from the FDA’
s
database of postmarketing requirements and commitments, ClinicalTrials.gov, and matched
peer-reviewed publications. Follow-up ended on April 7, 2017.
EXPOSURES Granting of accelerated approval.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Characteristics of preapproval and confirmatory studies
were compared in terms of study design features (randomization, blinding, comparator,
primary end point). Subsequent regulatory decisions and estimated time between
accelerated approval and fulfillment of regulatory requirements were summarized.
RESULTS The FDA granted accelerated approval to 22 drugs for 24 indications (19 for
indications involving cancer treatment) between 2009 and 2013. A total of 30 preapproval
studies supported the 24 indications. The median number of participants enrolled in the
preapproval studies was 132 (interquartile range, 89-224). Eight studies (27%) included fewer
than 100 participants and 20 (67%) included fewer than 200. At a minimum 3 years of
follow-up, 19 of 38 (50%) required confirmatory studies were completed, including 18
published reports. Twenty-five of the 38 (66%) examined clinical efficacy, 7 (18%) evaluated
longer follow-up, and 6 (16%) focused on safety The proportion of studies with randomized
designs did not differ before and after accelerated approval (12/30 [40%] vs 10/18 [56%];
difference, 16%; 95% CI, −15% to 46%; P = .31). Postapproval requirements were completed
and demonstrated efficacy in 10 of 24 indications (42%) on the basis of trials that evaluated
surrogate measures. Among the 14 of 24 indications (58%) that had not yet completed all
requirements, at least 1 of the confirmatory studies failed to demonstrate clinical benefit
in 2 (8%), were terminated in 2 (8%), and were delayed by more than 1 year in 3 (13%).
Studies were progressing according to target timelines for the remaining 7 indications (29%).
Clinical benefit had not yet been confirmed for 8 indications that had been initially approved
5 or more years prior.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among 22 drugs with 24 indications granted accelerated
approval by the FDA in 2009-2013, efficacy was often confirmed in postapproval trials a
minimum of 3 years after approval, although confirmatory trials and preapproval trials had
similar design elements, including reliance on surrogate measures as outcomes.

 T
he US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has several
pathways aimed at expediting the development and ap-
proval of drugs that address serious or life-threatening
conditions.1The“acceleratedapproval”pathwaypermitstheFDA
tograntmarketingauthorizationonthebasisofsurrogatemea-
sures, such as biomarkers, laboratory values, or other physical
measuresthatmayserveasindicatorsofclinicaloutcomessuch
assymptomcontrolormortality,thatareonly“reasonablylikely”
topredictclinicalbenefit.2Onceacceleratedapprovaldrugsare
grantedmarketingauthorization,theFDArequiresthatthespon-
sorscompleteconfirmatorytrialstodescribeandverifyclinical
efficacy.3 When these requirements are fulfilled, the drug’
s la-
bel may be updated to account for the new information.
Although special pathways like accelerated approval can
be highly effective in facilitating the approval of certain new
drugs,4,5 these pathways have also been a source of contro-
versy. Drugs approved via expedited pathways may have
greater safety risks to patients.6,7 In a recent evaluation of 222
novel therapeutic agents approved by the FDA in 2001-2010,
postmarket safety events were more frequent among drugs re-
ceiving accelerated approval.7 There is also uncertainty about
whether observed effects on surrogate measures will materi-
alize into clinical improvements.8 In a review of drugs ap-
proved by the FDA between 2005 and 2012 on the basis of lim-
ited evidence, a minority showed efficacy in clinical trials in
the postapproval period.9 Confirmatory trials evaluating the
clinical benefit of drugs in the accelerated approval pathway
can also be substantially delayed.10 In a previous evaluation
of accelerated approval of 35 oncology drugs, clinical benefit
was demonstrated in confirmatory studies for approximately
half of new indications,11 but drugs granted accelerated ap-
proval quickly become standard of care despite the limited evi-
dence on which they were approved.12
Implementationoftheacceleratedapprovalpathwayinre-
cent years has not been characterized. This study was de-
signed to compare the evidence gathered on qualifying drugs
before and after approval, including the extent to which con-
firmatorystudieswerecompletedanddeterminedwhetherthe
drugs demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits.13 The time
between accelerated approval and fulfillment of postap-
proval requirements was also assessed.
Methods
Sample Identification
Two investigators (H.N. and K.R.S.) reviewed publicly avail-
able FDA documents (CDER Drug and Biologic Accelerated
Approvalsasof30June2016andNovelDrugApprovalsfor2011-
2013) to identify drugs granted accelerated approval between
January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013.1 The CDER Drug and
BiologicAcceleratedApprovalslistiscompiledbytheFDA’
sCen-
ter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). The Novel Drug
Approvals report is an annual catalog of approved new molecu-
lar entities. The sample included drugs that received acceler-
ated approval as new therapeutic agents and as supplemental
approvals (products already approved for other indications).
Drugs that received original marketing authorization prior to
2009 were also included if they received a supplemental accel-
erated approval for a new indication during the study period.
Accelerated approvals for new formulations (eg, tablet vs in-
jection)ofalreadyapprovedagentswereexcluded(n = 1).Toen-
sure that no approvals were missed, the consistency of the
sample was confirmed with a previously published report on
FDA approvals.14 Drugs approved up to 2013 were included, al-
lowingatleast3yearsforthecompletionandpublicationofcon-
firmatory clinical studies (median, 5 years).
Identification of Preapproval Studies
Theclinicalstudiesunderlyingacceleratedapprovalwereiden-
tified and characterized. For all drugs in the sample, the medi-
cal review reports and product labels from the Drugs@FDA da-
tabase were examined to identify preapproval studies that
established the drug’
s efficacy. Drugs@FDA is a publicly avail-
able database of all FDA-approved products and contains the
approval history for each product, including links to commu-
nications from the FDA to the sponsor, and product label
updates.15 When available, medical review reports were used
to gather information about preapproval trial characteristics.
Medical review reports provide a comprehensive overview of
the efficacy and safety of a drug. When medical reviews were
not available (as can be the case for supplemental approvals),
theproductlabelsthatdescribethekeyclinicalstudiesthatsup-
portedtheacceleratedapprovalforanewindicationwereused.
Identification of Postapproval Confirmatory Studies
The FDA’
s approval letters available in the Drugs@FDA data-
basewerereviewedtoidentifytheconfirmatorystudyrequire-
ments at the time of accelerated approval.16 Postmarketing
study requirements focusing on safety evaluations alone un-
der FDAAA Section 505(o)(3) regulations were excluded.17 In-
formation reported in product labels and FDA’
s approval let-
ters were used to summarize how the FDA characterized the
main limitation of the available data at the time of acceler-
ated approval and whether required postmarketing studies as-
sessed efficacy, safety, or long-term follow-up.
Key Points
Question What are the characteristics and findings of preapproval
and mandated postapproval trials of drugs granted US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) accelerated approval between 2009
and 2013?
Findings The FDA granted accelerated approval to 22 drugs for 24
indications. Clinical trials conducted before (n=30) and after
(n=18) approval had similar design characteristics, such as lack of
blinding, randomization, and comparator groups. Of the required
postapproval confirmatory studies, half were completed a
minimum of 3 years after approval, and of these, most showed
some benefit but relied on surrogate measures rather than clinical
outcomes.
Meaning Among 24 indications granted accelerated approval by
the FDA in 2009-2013, 42% had efficacy confirmed in
postapproval trials a minimum of 3 years after approval, although
both preapproval and postapproval trials had limitations in the
study designs and end points used.

 ClinicalTrials.gov specifies the status (eg, still recruiting, ongo-
ingbutnolongerrecruiting,completed),aswellasstartandend
date. Whether the confirmatory study was completed or ongo-
ing per specified timelines in the FDA’
s approval letters was as-
sessed. Studies were considered to be delayed if the estimated
primary completion date in ClinicalTrials.gov was at least 1
year later than that specified in the FDA approval letters. When
therewasadiscrepancybetweentheFDA’

to determine the status of postapproval study requirements.
Identification of Published Reports
Usingastepwiseapproach,21,22 publishedreportsofcompleted
confirmatory studies were identified. First, whether a publica-
tion link was available on the ClinicalTrials.gov file was as-
sessed for each study. ClinicalTrials.gov periodically searches
PubMed to identify corresponding publications; study inves-
tigators can also add publication links manually. Second,
PubMedwassearchedusingtheClinicalTrials.govidentification
number. Third, PubMed and Google were searched using the
name of the principal investigator of the study (when available
inClinicalTrials.gov)incombinationwiththeconditionanddrug
name.Identifiedpublicationswerematchedtothecorrespond-
ingpostmarketingstudybasedonthecondition,comparator(s),
enrollment, and primary and secondary outcome measures.
Data Extraction
Information extracted from each preapproval and confirma-
tory study included design (randomized vs nonrandomized),
comparator(s), participant enrollment, and primary end point.
Comparatorswereclassifiedasactive(intrialscomparingdrugs
AvsB),add-on(intrialscomparingdrugsA+BvsdrugBalone),
placebo, or none. Drugs tested in single-intervention-group
trials were classified as having no comparators. Type of blind-
ing (double blind vs open label) was recorded. Study findings
were summarized in terms of the specified primary end point.
In confirmatory studies, whether the findings demonstrated
verification of clinical benefit was assessed. All data extrac-
tionwasperformedindependentlyby2investigators(H.N.and
K.R.S.) and disagreements resolved by consensus.
Assessment of Regulatory Outcomes
To determine whether drugs granted accelerated approvals
later had their labels updated, changes to product labels and
the accompanying regulatory letters were assessed. The FDA’
s
correspondence with product sponsors on topics related to the
approval and changes in status of their products is publicly
available in the Drugs@FDA database. Regulatory letters were
systematically screened for either confirmation of the fulfill-
ment of the requirements23 or the lack of regulatory action as
of the end of our data collection (April 7, 2017). The time be-
tween the granting of accelerated approval and the associ-
ated label update was determined.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptivestatisticswereusedtocharacterizetheclinicalstud-
iessupportingtheacceleratedapprovalofdrugsincludedinthe
sample. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and t tests were used as ap-
propriatetoexaminedifferencesinstudyfeaturesbetweenpre-
approval and confirmatory studies, including enrollment, de-
sign, comparator(s), and primary end points. A 2-tailed P<.005
was considered statistically significant, taking into account the
10comparisonsmadebetweenthe2groupsofstudies.Allanaly-
ses were performed using Stata version 14 (Stata Corp).
Results
Between 2009 and 2013, the FDA granted accelerated ap-
proval to 22 drugs for 24 indications, with 2 products granted
the designation for 2 indications (Table 1). The 2 drugs with 2
indicationswereeverolimusandbrentuximabvedotin.Thirteen
approvals were for novel therapeutic agents and 11 were for
supplementalindicationsforpreviouslyapproveddrugs.Can-
cer treatment accounted for 19 of the indications. The remain-
ing indications included a range of conditions including

Features of Preapproval Studies
Thirty preapproval studies supported the 24 indications of in-
terest. Twelve studies (40%) were randomized and 6 (20%)
were double blind (Table 2 and Table 3). Six preapproval stud-
ies (20%) used placebo controls, 3 (10%) used an active com-
parator, another 2 (7%) evaluated the active agent as an add-on
to a standard treatment regimen, and 19 (63%) had no com-
parators. The median number of participants enrolled in the
preapprovalstudieswas132(interquartilerange,89-224).Eight
studies (27%) included fewer than 100 participants and 20
(67%) included fewer than 200.
The most common surrogate measure used in the preap-
proval studies was a measure of disease response (n = 21
[70%]), reflecting that most were oncology drugs (Table 2 and
Table3).Othersurrogatemeasuresincludedtime-to-eventout-
comes (eg, time to sputum culture conversion, progression-
freesurvival),changeinbaselinebiomarkerlevels(eg,liveriron
concentration), and acceptable safety.
Nonrandomized, noncomparative single-group studies
formed the exclusive basis of accelerated approval for 14 in-
dications (47%), and preapproval studies with fewer than 200
participants supported the accelerated approval of 12 indica-
tions (40%).
Status of Required Postapproval Confirmatory Studies
At the time of accelerated approval, the FDA labels emphasized
the limitations of the available data (Figure). The majority of
labels, 21 of 24 (88%), highlighted the lack of evidence demon-
stratinganimprovementindisease-relatedsymptomsorsurvival
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). To address these limitations, the
FDA required the completion of 38 postapproval confirmatory
trials for the 24 indications. Twenty-five of the 38 (66%) exam-
ined clinical efficacy, 7 (18%) evaluated longer follow-up, and 6
(16%) focused on safety and pharmacokinetics (Figure).
Most requirements were for randomized clinical trials
(n = 25 [66%]). The remaining 13 requirements (34%) were
for single-group studies including long-term extensions of
preapproval studies (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Prespeci-
fied primary end points were reported in 13 (34%) of the re-
quired confirmatory studies from publicly available docu-
ments.Amongthissample,themostcommonprespecifiedend
point was progression-free survival (n = 8), followed by over-
all survival (n = 2) (eTable 2).
Nineteenof38confirmatorystudyrequirements(50%)had

 double blind (Table 4). One study included a placebo compara-
tor, 2 evaluated the accelerated approval agent as an add-on to
a standard treatment regimen, 7 (39%) had active comparators,
and8(44%)hadnocomparators(single-groupstudies).Thema-
jority(14of18[78%])ofcompletedconfirmatorystudiesincluded
morethan100participants;themediannumberofparticipants
was 345 (interquartile range, 111-619).
Surrogate measures were the primary end points in 17
(94%) of the 18 studies. Disease response was the most com-
mon surrogate (n = 9 [50%]), followed by progression-free sur-
vival(n = 6[33%])andpharmacokineticmeasures(n = 2[11%]).
The only confirmatory study that did not test a surrogate had
co–primary end points of overall survival and progression-
free survival.
Mostcompletedpostapprovalstudiesshowedthatthedrug
had some benefit on the surrogate measure (15/18 [83%]), in-
cluding 2 trials that evaluated pharmacokinetics (Table 4). The
remaining 3 studies (18%) either failed to demonstrate effi-
cacy or were terminated early. In a randomized clinical trial,
the addition of bevacizumab to radiotherapy improved pro-
gression-free survival but did not extend overall survival in pa-
tients with glioblastoma multiforme.18 Lapatinib combined
with taxane showed shorter progression-free survival com-
pared with trastuzumab as first-line therapy for human epi-
dermal growth factor–positive metastatic breast cancer.24 One
of the required confirmatory studies of ponatinib among pre-
viously untreated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia was
terminated early owing to higher rates of arterial occlusive
eventsobservedinpatientsreceivingponatinibinothertrials.25
Table 2 shows the comparison of preapproval and pub-
lished postapproval trial characteristics. The proportion with
randomized designs was not statistically significantly differ-
ent before and after accelerated approval (12/30 vs 10/18; dif-
ference, 16%; 95% CI, −15% to 46%; P = .31). The confirma-
tory studies were more likely to use the surrogate measure of
progression-free survival as the primary trial end point (1/30
vs 7/18; difference, 36%; 95% CI, 15%-56%; P = .001).
Regulatory Outcomes for Accelerated Approval Drugs
Of 24 indications treated by the drugs granted accelerated ap-
proval between 2009 and 2013, 10 (42%) fulfilled their post-
marketing requirements and had their labels updated (Figure).
All of the label updates were based on postmarketing studies
evaluating surrogate measures. Label changes were sup-
portedbyresponseratein6indications(25%)andprogression-
free survival in 4 (17%).
Among the remaining 14 indications with no label up-
dates, at least 1 of the confirmatory studies failed to demon-
strate clinical benefit in 2 (8%) and at least 1 of the studies were
terminated in 2 (8%). Studies for the remaining 10 indica-
tions remained ongoing, with 7 progressing according to tar-
get timelines and 3 reported to be delayed by more than 1 year.

Time from accelerated approval to fulfillment of requirements

 Discussion
The clinical trial evidence for therapeutic agents granted ac-
celerated approval by the FDA between 2009 and 2013 shows
that 14 of 24 indications for these drugs entered the market
on the basis of single-intervention-group studies that en-
rolledamedianof132patients,whichsomeinvestigatorswould
consider a small number. Half of required confirmatory stud-
ies were completed a minimum of 3 years after the approved
drug was on the market. The quality and quantity of postmar-
keting studies required by the FDA to confirm clinical benefit
varied widely across indications. There were few statistically
detectable differences in the key design features of trials con-
ductedbeforeandafterapproval.Nonrandomizedstudieswere
common in the accelerated approval pathway both before
(60%) and after (44%) market entry. Even though the major-
ity of completed studies showed positive results in the post-
marketing period, all completed confirmatory studies dem-
onstrating drug benefit evaluated surrogate measures of
disease activity rather than clinical outcomes.
Drugs granted accelerated approval receive market autho-
rization on the basis of fewer studies, smaller patient popula-
tions,shorterfollow-up,andless-establishedsurrogatemeasures
thandrugsapprovedviathetraditionalpathway.26Inthesecases,

10acceleratedapprovalsbetween2009and2013thathavesince
hadtheirrequirementsfulfilledandlabelsupdated,allofwhich
were for cancer indications, the studies used to confirm clini-
cal benefit tested surrogate measures. The FDA’
s senior scien-
tists consider overall survival to be the most dependable end
pointinclinicaltrialsofcancerdrugs.27Yetoverallsurvivalwas
among the prespecified primary end points in only 5% of re-
quired confirmatory studies. Disease response was the most
commonendpointinpostapprovaltrials,andalthoughdisease
response may be an appropriate surrogate measure in hemato-
logical malignancies, its adequacy depends on several factors,
such as the magnitude and duration of effect.28 In the remain-
ing cases, postmarketing requirements were fulfilled based on
improvements in progression-free survival, which may not be
a statistically validated surrogate for survival in all settings.28
These findings are consistent with previous research showing
that cancer drugs approved on the basis of surrogate measures
may not show survival benefit in the postmarketing period.29
Another finding from the current study is the slow pro-
gression of some postapproval studies. A recent Government
Accountability Office report criticized the FDA’
s oversight of
drugs approved on the basis of surrogate measures.19 Al-
though the fulfillment of postmarketing commitments and re-
quirements improved overall from 2009 to 2011, the number
of studies with delays doubled during the same period.20 For
14 (58%) of 24 indications granted accelerated approval from
2009 to 2013, results from required confirmatory studies were
notavailableafteramedianof5yearsoffollow-up,and8(42%)
of 19 incomplete confirmatory studies were either termi-
nated or delayed by more than 1 year.
Confirmatory studies failed to demonstrate clinical ben-
efitin2indicationsgrantedacceleratedapprovalbetween2009
and 2013. According to the Code of Federal Regulations, the
FDA may withdraw a therapeutic agent if confirmatory stud-
ies fail to verify its clinical benefit. However, according to pub-
licly available documents, the FDA has neither rescinded its
approval nor imposed additional requirements for these 2 in-
dications. Historically, the FDA has rarely withdrawn an indi-
cation during the 25 years since the accelerated approval path-
way was established. For bevacizumab, which received
accelerated approval in 2008 on the basis of progression-free
survivalforpatientswithmetastaticbreastcancer,theFDAlater
rescinded its approval for this indication after multiple post-
marketing trials revealed no improvement in survival and in-
creased toxicity.30
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the analysis was lim-
ited to the preapproval and confirmatory studies presented to
the FDA. There may be other studies that evaluated the clini-
cal benefit of therapeutic agents granted accelerated approv-
als, but if those studies were rigorous and reflected strongly
on the utility of the product, it is likely that the manufacturer
would have presented them to the FDA and used them to con-
tribute to any label updates.31 When safety-related postmar-
keting requirements under FDAAA Section 505(o)(3) gener-
ated efficacy data, this information was captured if it was used
to inform label changes. These findings are supported by an-
other large investigation of drugs approved on the basis of sur-
rogate measures or single trials, which showed that postap-
proval studies rarely evaluate efficacy using clinical
outcomes.32 Second, the adequacy of the confirmatory stud-
ies in addressing questions about the drugs that the FDA con-
sidered to be unresolved was not examined because such in-
sights are not available from the FDA documents.
Third, the study examined a recent cohort of drugs that
had received approvals, and the minimum 3 years of fol-
low-up may not be adequate for completing some postap-
proval studies. However, the findings were consistent with a
previous review of accelerated approvals in oncology, which
showed a similar proportion of incomplete confirmatory
studies.10Fourth,thisassessmentfocusedonthetrials’sample
size, comparators, end points, and findings. Data on other im-
portant characteristics, including risk of bias and trial dura-
tion, were not consistently reported in FDA documents and
published reports. Fifth, the comparisons between preap-
proval and postapproval study characteristics are underpow-
ered to detect statistically significant differences.
Conclusions
Among 22 drugs with 24 indications granted accelerated ap-
proval by the FDA in 2009-2013, 42% had efficacy confirmed
in postapproval trials a minimum of 3 years after approval,
although confirmatory trials and preapproval trials had simi-
lar design elements, including reliance on surrogate mea-
sures as outcomes.
