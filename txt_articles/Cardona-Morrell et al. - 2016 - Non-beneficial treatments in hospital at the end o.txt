Abstract
Purpose: To investigate the extent of objective ‘non-beneficial treatments (NBTs)’ (too much) any-
time in the last 6 months of life in routine hospital care.
Data sources: English language publications in Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane library, and
the grey literature (January 1995–April 2015).
Study selection: All study types assessing objective dimensions of non-beneficial medical or surgical
diagnostic, therapeutic or non-palliative procedures administered to older adults at the end of life (EOL).
Data extraction: A 13-item quality score estimated independently by two authors.
Results of data synthesis: Evidence from 38 studies indicates that on average 33–38% of patients
near the EOL received NBTs. Mean prevalence of resuscitation attempts for advanced stage
patients was 28% (range 11–90%). Mean death in intensive care unit (ICU) was 42% (range 11–90%);
and mean death rate in a hospital ward was 44.5% (range 29–60%). Mean prevalence of active mea-
sures including dialysis, radiotherapy, transfusions and life support treatment to terminal patient
was 7–77% (mean 30%). Non-beneficial administration of antibiotics, cardiovascular, digestive and
endocrine treatments to dying patients occurred in 11–75% (mean 38%). Non-beneficial tests were
performed on 33–50% of patients with do-not-resuscitate orders. From meta-analyses, the pooled
prevalence of non-beneficial ICU admission was 10% (95% CI 0–33%); for chemotherapy in the last
six weeks of life was 33% (95% CI 24–41%).
Conclusion: This review has confirmed widespread use of NBTs at the EOL in acute hospitals. While
a certain level of NBT is inevitable, its extent, variation and justification need further scrutiny.

 Introduction
The lack of agreed definitions of terms such as treatment futility,
inappropriate and non-beneficial treatment (NBT) makes a global
dialog difficult and perpetuates the practice of aggressive, and
costly, care at the end of life (EOL) [1]. The concept of ‘futility’
can be seen as a subjective perception of lack of treatment benefit
when patients or healthcare providers attach varying weights to
the clinical, social or economic perspectives. But perceived and
qualitative descriptions of futility cannot easily be measured or
replicated for monitoring in routine practice, especially if the
patient wishes are not incorporated [2, 3]. A previous review has
examined the moral and clinical meaning of futility in the context
of proposed guidelines for initiating the EOL dialog [4]. A more
recent systematic review investigated the criteria used to justify
claims of futility in limitations of treatment for people who had
experienced a cardiac arrest. They found that definitions of futility
lacked explicit thresholds and that estimates were based on insuffi-
cient variables to provide statistical confidence for decision-
making [5].
The term ‘inappropriate’ treatment may be interpreted as inter-
ventions that are ineffective in achieving the desired goals, or are
‘a disservice to patients who are subjected to ongoing and likely
uncomfortable conditions with no benefit’ [6]. In other words, the
nature of the illness would not be influenced by the resources used
in an acute hospital.
Following peer feedback on the implications of value-laden
words such as ‘too much’, ‘futile’, ‘inappropriate’ or ‘dispropor-
tionate’ care, the expression NBT appeared to be more acceptable
as it indicates a treatment that was administered with little or no
hope of it having any effect, largely because of the underlying
state of the patient’s health and the known or expected poor
prognosis regardless of treatment. The term NBT therefore
reflects an objective inverse correlation between intensity of treat-
ment and the expected degree of improvement in a patient’s
health status, ability for survival to hospital discharge [7], or
improvement in quality of life [8]. Our focus is on aggressive
active management beyond comfort care in the last 6 months of
life when the clinical presentation should have signaled the time
for transition from aggressive to palliative or comfort care [9]. In
turn, palliative care is understood as interventions to prevent and
relief physical and spiritual suffering for patients and families
facing life-threatening illness [10].
As part of the review, we will use objective parameters to deter-
mine NBT in the last 6 months of life to adopt or adapt as oper-
ational and measurable concepts in routine care. This is for the
purpose of further enhancing awareness and reducing non-beneficial
EOL treatment that is ineffective [9], unethical, costly [11] and not
in line with patients wishes [12].
The concept of ‘non-beneficial’ due to ‘insufficient’ treatment [13]
is beyond the scope of this review, as our focus is on use of the term
‘non-beneficial’ implying ‘too much’, ‘unnecessary’ or ‘excessive’.
Purpose
The objectives of this review were to examine:
1. the variety of definitions of NBTs and assess the ability to meas-
ure them in practice;
2. the extent of measured ‘non-beneficial’ hospital treatments at the
EOL.
Study selection
Eligible studies had a target population (P) of older patients. The
scope of the search for interventions (I) considered non-beneficial
covered objective definitions of aggressive management such as
invasive procedures, operations, complex medications and costly
actions commencing or occurring in the last 6 months of life. This
covers the last 6 months to the last days of life, a period that
qualifies ‘terminal illness’. That is, a progressive disease where
death as a consequence of that condition can reasonably be
expected within 6 months [14]. Comparator (C) interventions
were not an eligibility criterion in this review examining the extent
of the problem. Outcomes (O) of interest measuring NBT in ter-
minal illness included chemotherapy in the last two weeks, paren-
teral
hydration,
artificial
nutrition,
dialysis,
intensive
care
admission in the last few days of life, mechanical ventilation (MV)
in the last days, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in terminal
patients, intravenous (IV) antibiotics in terminal care, transfusion
and any invasive non-palliative treatments which were either
administered against patient wishes, delivered due to clinician’s
uncertainty of prognosis, personal beliefs, sense of duty to cure or
moral obligation, or considered unwarranted by treating staff but
were administered due to family demands or health system
accountability pressures. Eligible study (S) methods included ran-
domized controlled trials, retrospective data reviews (audits), clin-
ical staff surveys, descriptive studies, qualitative studies and
observational studies.
Descriptive studies were included as the concept of NBT is still
the subject of debate and objective #1 was to examine definitions
and the ability to measure them in practice. Descriptive studies were
only excluded if they did not address at least one of our study objec-
tives. Quantitative studies were given more weight as objective #2
was to assess the extent of the problem.
Methods
Data sources
We conducted a review of the English language medical literature
in Ovid SP (Medline, EMBASE), PubMed, Cochrane library, and
the grey literature for publications between January 1995 and
April 2015. Our focus was on elderly patients with terminal illness
hospitalized at the EOL. Advanced chronic illness was included but
was limited to cancer, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease,
chronic liver disease, stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
Search strategy
We used the following combination of terms in the abstract, title or
as keyword, limiting the search to English language and years
1995–2015: inappropriate or disproportionate or non-beneficial or
costly or futility AND hospital or hospitalization AND cancer, or
chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease,
stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease AND advanced or
terminal or life-limiting or death or dying (Online Appendix 1).
Literature searches were mainly conducted by one author (J.C.H.K.)
with single database cross-searching of appropriateness by another
(M.C.M.); manual searches of the reference lists of papers eligible
for inclusion were conducted by several co-authors (J.C.H.K.,
M.A., K.H., M.C.M.).

 Data extraction
Articles were imported into EndNote and subgroups of eligible vs.
excluded were compiled. Title and abstract eligibility assessments
were conducted independently by two authors (J.C.H.K. and M.C.M.)
using the agreed protocol with inclusion criteria specified in
the ‘Study selection’ section. Exclusions with reasons were documen-
ted in an excel spreadsheet (J.C.H.K.) and double checked by a
second author (M.C.M.). Discrepancies about eligibility assessments
between the two authors were resolved by an external third aca-
demic colleague who was not an author of this manuscript but
experienced in systematic reviews. Quality assessment conducted by
one author (M.C.M.) using an agreed and purpose-designed suit-
ability score comprising objective items (see below). This was devel-
oped by the authors using modified domains from existing bias
assessment tools for non-randomized studies [15, 16] and scores
cross-checked by another author (J.C.H.K.) for potential discrepan-
cies of opinion. A suitability score was calculated to assess quality of
the study design and analysis. Assignment of 1 point for each item
out of 13 items effectively gave higher weight to quantitative studies
with replicable measurements of NBT. The suitability score assessed
whether the study:
1. had quantitative design to answer the research question;
2. had clear description of objectives;
3. had sample size of >100 or justifiable sample size calculation;
4. had clearly stated subject selection criteria;
5. included random selection of participants;
6. reported response rate >80% and a denominator;
7. included a comparison group;
8. reported quantitative indicators;
9. used validated outcome measures or defined them;
10. reported on all intended outcomes;
11. did not exclude important cases from analysis;
12. had <20% incomplete outcome ascertainment;
13. incorporated potential confounders in the analysis.
This review is not registered with PROSPERO because of the
ongoing considerations about search terms and definitions between
authors. This enriching process meant the protocol had to be
dynamic until late in the review. PROSPERO requires registration of
the protocol before the critical assessment commences.
Analyses
A descriptive compilation of definitions and extent of NBT was sum-
marized in tables, using the reported measurements. In deciding on
the relevance and feasibility of monitoring measured outcomes, we
examined the indicators against the following criteria: objective or
subjective, use of an expert panel, items routinely available in the
clinical setting, whether social or system factors were incorporated
and whether there was a need for additional resources to document
the outcomes.
Actual prevalence of indicators of NBT was generally presented
without any attempt to pool results across studies as the purpose of
the review was to examine the variety of definitions and assess the
ability to measure them in practice. Therefore, for most measures,
the mean across studies and range was presented. No contact with
authors of eligible studies was made to find any additional informa-
tion. Meta-analysis was only attempted (by RMT) for the indicators
where definitions were homogeneous/replicable and there were more
than three studies reporting them, so they were not pre-specified.
A random effects meta-analysis was conducted to obtain a pooled
prevalence (proportion), with studies weighted to account for the
standard error and heterogeneity [17]. Forest plots were created to
show the study specific and pooled proportions, and ordered by
year of study publication. Heterogeneity was assessed using the
I-squared statistic, an intuitive expression of inconsistency of study
results expressed as a percentage of variation across studies due to
clinical and methodological diversity rather than to chance [18, 19].

Results of data synthesis
Thirty-eight studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review of NBT
among patients who have been hospitalized (Online Appendix 2, Fig. 1).
The eligible studies included 1 213 171 subjects in 10 countries:
USA 18 studies, Europe/UK 7 studies, Canada 5 studies, Brazil 3 stud-
ies, Taiwan/South Korea 3 studies and Australia 2 studies (Table 1).
Most of the studies (24/38 eligible) were exclusively retrospective data
reviews, seven were cross-sectional surveys, four descriptive qualitative
studies and three prospective data collections, with two of these using
mixed methods. Target groups for the measurement of NBT were
mixed and covered: critically ill hospitalized patients (20 studies),
healthcare provider or relatives of deceased patients with malignancies
or dementia (13 studies), and healthcare providers or surrogates of
hospitalized patients with advanced illness (10 studies).
The quality scores for addressing our research question were gen-
erally high (mean and median score of 9 out of 13), with 10 studies
scoring 11 or higher and only 4 studies scoring <6.
Of the 38 eligible studies, 29 reported objective NBT estimates
based on the definition adopted by each study (Table 2). The most
commonly reported estimates were ICU admission, administration
of CPR, in-hospital mortality and use of chemotherapy in the last
6 months of life. Despite high heterogeneity of study designs and
outcomes, most markers of NBT used items that are routinely col-
lected or readily available in hospital records and can be used to
compare definitions. The few exceptions were cost of care, cost sav-
ings from ICU avoidance, imminent death and judgment that patient
would be unable to survive outside ICU [27, 32, 47].
The prevalence of objectively measured NBT using the defini-
tions with the most homogeneous denominators or timeframes var-
ied by type of intervention (Table 3). For example, ICU admission
among incurable patients in the period between the last 6 months
and the last 7 days of life ranged from 2.0% to 90% (mean 33.3%).
However, the seven studies meta-analyzed selected on the basis of
uniformity of definition of ICU admission in the last 6 weeks of life,
i.e. similar numerator/denominator measurements and similar time-
frames. For these, the pooled average estimate of non-beneficial ICU
admission was 10% (95% CI 0–33%; Fig. 1). Sensitivity analysis
excluding the largest, dominant study made the remaining studies more
homogeneous and the estimate dropped to 7% (95% CI 3–10%).
Likewise, studies reporting either newly initiated chemotherapy
at the EOL or ongoing chemotherapy for patients with or without
previous limitation of treatment administered in the period ranged
from 3% to 76% (mean 25.1%; Table 3). Meta-analyses of the five
studies reporting comparable timeframes for new or ongoing use of
chemotherapy in the last 6 weeks of life indicated that the overall
prevalence was 33% (95% CI 24–41%; Fig. 2).
Resuscitation attempts for terminal patients including those with
pre-existing limitations of care ranged from 11.0% to 90.0% (mean

 28.1%). Death in ICU or a hospital ward or post-discharge within a
few months of initiation of aggressive treatment also varied widely
from 11.0% to 96.4% (mean 58.0%). Non-beneficial tests were
undertaken in a third to half of patients with DNR orders and in a
quarter of those in the last 3 months of life (Table 3).
Other active management interventions included dialysis, radio-
therapy, transfusions and life support treatment and these were
administered on average to a third of terminal patients (mean
29.9% and range 7.0–77%). Non-beneficial medicines including
antibiotics, cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine treatments were
also administered to over a third of terminal patients (mean 38%,
range 10.7–75.0%). Other measurable NBT less commonly used
was expressed in terms of unnecessary use of hospitals, emergency
services and rapid response systems, duration of treatment and
length of stay and cost of ICU treatment.
In six studies of objective indicators, expert skill was required
to decide on the non-beneficial nature of some of the markers of
care chosen [24, 27, 29, 32, 37, 48]. These markers included
anticipated cardiac arrest, unnecessary medication, low ECOG
performance scores, treatment never reaching the patient’s goals
and treatment unable to improve patient’s survival or quality of
life. Markers incorporating health system factors were measured
in eight studies: underutilization of hospice care [41, 46, 53],
absence of palliative care consultation before ICU admission [54],
delayed documentation of code blue status [38], cost savings
from ICU avoidance [27], cost of hospitalization with/without
ICU admission [47] and delayed decision to forgo life-sustaining
treatment [34].
Unnecessary imaging were performed in at least a quarter of all
terminal patients in a large study [22] and unwarranted blood tests
at higher rates (37.0–49.0%) in a smaller study [26]. These could be
regarded as ‘low-value’ care and are distinct from invasive, life-
prolonging treatments that are non-beneficial.
Subjective definitions
Eleven studies included subjective definitions based on clinicians’
expertize to determine the non-beneficial nature of the treatment,
and where indicators were neither routinely collected nor amenable
to replication [6, 8, 13, 28, 32, 33, 36, 39, 42, 44, 51]. Examples of
these definitions include: procedures ‘when there is no evidence that
will prolong survival beyond a few days’ [4]; ‘perceived imbalance
between the amount or intensity of treatments being provided and
the patient’s expected survival, quality of life or wishes’ [13]; and
‘treatments that (1) would almost certainly result in a quality of life
that the patient has previously stated that he/she would not want,
or (2) are not consistent with the goals of care (as indicated by the
patient) [8]. In light of the inability to reliably measure or routinely
collect these definitions, the focus of this manuscript was then con-
fined to indicators that could help us operationalize and monitor the
concepts in the real world. The use of subjective definitions of non-
beneficial care will be the subject of a separate manuscript.
Discussion
This review has gathered a comprehensive list of objective indicators
of NBT measurable routinely in practice confirming widespread hos-
pital practice of non-beneficial patient management at the end of
life. We found a wide range of timeframes and intensity of interven-
tions and diagnostic procedures defined as NBT. While the preva-
lence varies by patient condition, health system and type of
aggressive treatment, overall the findings strongly indicate the per-
sistence of ambiguity about what is deemed non-beneficial, and a
culture of ‘doing everything possible’ even if it is against expressed
patients’ wishes. These behaviors have repercussions not only on the
capacity and financial sustainability of the health services, and per-
petuate the unrealistic high social expectation of survival at all costs,

 but also more importantly reflect a disregard for human dignity and
quality end of life.
Admission to an acute hospital and prevention of death through
clinical interventions are often the default position whether a patient
has a reversible component to their disease or whether they are at
their natural end of life [55]. As the elderly and frail population
increases, the number attendances to emergency rooms and admis-
sions to acute hospitals are rapidly expanding [56, 57]. Achieving a
balance between doing everything that is technically feasible but eth-
ically and clinically appropriate to improve quality of care at the
end of life is difficult [11, 58]. Clinical judgment alone does not
always accurately predict patients who may not benefit from further
active treatment [59].
Objective indicators of NBT
The most commonly reported measurable outcomes across studies
in this review were admissions to ICU for patients with either
advanced incurable disease or pre-existing limitations of treatment;
administration of CPR for terminal patients with or without prior
limitation of treatment orders; and initiation or continuation of
chemotherapy in the last 14 days to 1 month of life. In addition to
inflicting unnecessary patient suffering, these aggressive management
approaches have substantial resource implications for hospitals.
These indicators could be easily adopted as markers of non-
beneficial care and monitored routinely to inform hospital practice.
Other forms of life support treatment for patients with DNR are
also clearly non-beneficial and the variety of interventions may be
too heterogeneous to aggregate them into a single indicator. Death
in ICU or death in hospital are available indicators but their specifi-
city to mark them as ‘non-beneficial’ cannot be established from
routine data unless detailed audits are undertaken.
For instance, linking with additional clinical EOL flags could
turn this indicator into a relevant, actionable and internationally
comparable quality performance measure useful for health policy-
making, monitoring and development of interventions [60]. Non-
beneficial medicines cannot be easily ascertained without expert
input and are not always available in clinical databases. ‘Underuse’
of hospice care (i.e. short LOS or late admission to hospice) cannot
always be assumed to be non-beneficial care if there is no choice
to use them earlier in health systems with insufficient hospices to
refer terminal patients, or if their location is unsuitable for people
in remote areas; or if the health insurance does not cover the ser-
vices. The portion of ‘overuse’ of emergency and intensive care ser-
vices in the last months of life that is driven by patients or families
rather than by physicians can only be changed through a public
education campaign [6]. The ‘non-beneficial’ nature of long hos-
pital length of stays hemodialysis, MV, central line insertions,
administration of vasoactive agents and blood products may still
be debatable and difficult to monitor in light of uncertainty of
time to death. The recognition of the dying as someone with
multi-morbidity and in advanced illness refractory to conventional
treatment with no hope of recovery within a few months could
minimize prognostic uncertainty. Finally, failure to reach agree-
ment on the definitions, timeframes for interventions and inclusion
of the patient perspective makes it challenging to determine their
undesirability as NBT.
System factors are known contributors to the perpetuation of
NBT although most studies in our review did not address the rea-
sons and omitted health system factors. They include lack of oppor-
tunity for EOL discussions or communication failures between

 health professionals and patients [61], healthcare professionals’ sub-
optimal skills for recognition of illness severity, diagnosis of dying
or need for limiting treatment [28, 46]; uncertainty about prognosis
[44]; financial incentives to prolong services to insured patients in
some health systems [62]; physicians’ ethical ambivalence [63], cul-
tural beliefs, spiritual principles, disagreement within the treating
team, legal pressures [42, 44]; absence of proper documentation on
limitations of care and lack of discussion with patients [28]; or lack
of understanding of advance care planning [4, 7, 8, 34]. Further,
excess intensity of care can lead to job dissatisfaction and be a sur-
rogate indicator of high workload and inadequate communication
within the treating team [36].
Other barriers leading to non-beneficial medical and surgical
management at the EOL are multifactorial. Among the causes of
NBT reported by the reviewed studies, family pressures (73%),
communication issues before or after ICU (19%), medico-legal
concerns (5%) and disagreement between specialist teams (2%)
were mentioned [6]. Reported causes for non-beneficial ICU
admission among oncology patients were clinical trial in inter-
mediate situations (47%), initiation of full-scale first-line treat-
ment in newly diagnosed advanced cases (30%) and lack of
communication of limitation of treatment preferences in refractory
bedridden patients (23%) [24]. In two studies, the authors argued
that
continuation
of
aggressive
therapy
despite
not-for-
resuscitation orders [26] and reversal of limitations of treatment
[21] was justifiable as it contributed to patient survival until hos-
pital discharge, suggesting that not-for-resuscitation order should
signal withdrawal of CPR only.
Chemotherapy overuse close to the time of death and under-
referral to hospice services have been suggested as potential indicators
of poor quality of care [41]. Importantly, having a ‘do-not-resuscitate
order’ (DNR) does not inevitably imply withdrawal of all manage-
ment; only cessation of aggressive life-prolonging treatment, which
in most cases, has little effect on immediate or medium term sur-
vival [26]. Specific examples of reasons for use of chemotherapy in
the last 6 months of life include the doctors’ inclination to offer
clinical trials of aggressive support to newly diagnosed patients
[30, 49]; lack of knowledge and competency with EOL care led to
non-beneficial ICU admission regardless of prognosis [46]; doctors’
uncertainty about disease course in cases of leukemia where multiple
disease relapses can be followed by many remissions [49]; or clinical
inertia of physicians not considering prognosis as they are trained
to cure [20].
It is worth noting that some degree of these treatments is likely
to be justified depending on whether the death is anticipated
(known to be in the last 6 months or last year of life), or unex-
pected (patient in ICU in the last month or last 14 days of life).
Hence, reducing prognostic uncertainty by early consideration and
documentation of disease trajectory and estimated patient survival
may guide the decision of whether and to what extent to adminis-
ter NBT.
Addressing non-beneficial treatments
In this review, we aimed to suggest a practical list of indicators for
measuring and identifying NBT. While quantification was deemed
feasible for many aspects of terminal NBT, two issues may affect the
usefulness of the indicators: first, outcome bias when two patients
who have the same terminal risk profile receive treatment and one
survives and the other dies. Some may argue that this changes what
is non-beneficial. Second, making these decisions in the moment, as
the direction of the decision may vary depending on factors such as
clinician’s beliefs that everything should be done [64], whether func-
tional status has been previously assessed, or whether EOL discus-
sions incorporating patient values have not been held [65].
While a standard definition of NBT is not yet agreed, common
indicators have been identified and strategies advocated to minimize
or prevent NBC have been proposed. They range from health pro-
fessional education, promotion of early discussion of resuscitation
status with patients and guidelines for admission to intensive care
unit [42]. Some believe that advance care planning and communica-
tion training contribute to lower rates of perceived NBT [8]. Others
recommend the use of validated comorbidity (Charlson Score) and
geriatric scores (G8 score) [25] or standard assessment of perform-
ance status (ECOG 3 or 4) to support the clinical impression of lack
of benefit of further anticancer treatment [11]. A decision-making
model has also been suggested where a dedicated intensivist coordi-
nates multiple opinions of subspecialists managing different patient
organs before determination of ineffectiveness of ICU admission
[46]. The feasibility of implementation of these models is yet to be
determined.
The perpetuation of false hope, scarcity of healthcare resources,
staff dissatisfaction with anticipated poor outcomes and imbalanced
utilization of those resources [66] should be sufficient deterrents for
excessive, non-beneficial responses to terminal illness. The long-held
perception of death as treatment failure [44] still leads to prolonga-
tion of treatment and it is seen as ‘the default option’ for patients
presenting to emergency departments [28]. These perceptions con-
tinue to drive the medicalization of death, prolongation of patient
suffering [67] and prevent high-quality EOL care [68].
Strengths of this review
This review documented extensive quantitative definitions and indi-
cators of NBT used in many countries over two decades. A compre-
hensive bias assessment tool with 13 items was used to measure
quality. We acknowledge that variation in findings across studies
may depend on the definition and the measurement used, and tried
to aggregate the most homogeneous denominators in the meta-
analysis. Meta-analyses were possible for two EOL-specific indica-
tors (chemotherapy and ICU admission) despite some heterogeneity
of timeframes. The indicators covered indicators reflecting patient,
practice and system issues. Most study designs were of high quality
and most reported indicators are collected routinely in hospitals and
therefore their ongoing or episodic surveillance is feasible and
should be encouraged to monitor trends, investigate locally relevant
causes and respond to them accordingly.
Limitations of this review
Only four studies were qualitative, and eight reported perceived
NBT. Expert opinion is considered lower-level evidence [69] and
indicators are subject to value judgments despite agreed generic defi-
nitions. We focused on the interpretation of evidence from the quan-
titative
perspective,
where
methods
and
measurements
were
appropriate to answer our research question.
Eight of the articles were conference abstracts with insufficient
details for a complete critical appraisal, which may have biased the
quality assessment toward the negative side in half of them [25, 27,
35, 54]. However, we included abstract articles in an effort to pre-
vent publication bias towards favorable outcomes resulting from
excluding evidence from research that would otherwise go unre-
ported [70, 71]. In studies published as abstracts, the conclusions
466
Cardona-Morrell et al.

 equated intense interventions with unnecessary care based on
authors’ perception or personal knowledge rather than evidence
from measurable definitions in the studies [23, 25].
Our analysis found high heterogeneity but we believe it is the
duty of systematic reviewers to report on all findings from all avail-
able eligible studies, however diverse or inconsistent. Clinical and
methodological heterogeneity is inevitable in the real world [19] and
it indicates that variability is due to differences in study design or
target population, and the generalizability is not high. It is expected
that as evidence accrues over time and new studies are less heteroge-
neous in design, the pooled estimate becomes more accurate. We
dealt with the problem of heterogeneity by estimating I2 which
‘seeks to determine whether there are genuine differences underlying
the results of the studies (heterogeneity), or whether the variation in
findings is compatible with chance alone (homogeneity)’ [18]. We
used random effects models to allow for this heterogeneity in the
pooled estimates. The wide confidence intervals reflect the hetero-
geneity so that the precision is not overstated and show the wide
range of true values that the studies support.
Only English language articles were included although 10 studies
were conducted among non-English speaking settings and subjects.
Finally, it is possible that our search strategy missed some relevant
studies as the automated search failed to find numerous eligible arti-
cles which were later found through the manual search of reference
lists (see PRISMA diagram). We made an effort to check all refer-
ences from all eligible articles and included newly identified in this
review.
Conclusions
This review confirmed that the practice of NBT at the EOL has been
recognized for at least two decades and it remains today despite
much literature about its negative repercussions for patients, fam-
ilies, healthcare professionals and the health system.
The emerging conclusion is that given the uncertainty of prog-
nosis on time to death, the social and ethical pressures, and the
compassionate recommendation for trial ICU admissions while
families come to terms with the inevitable, it appears that a certain
level of NBT must always be present, but this does not mean that
its prevalence should not be reduced. The debate must continue
about the acceptable and affordable extent of NBT and the justifi-
cations for it.
