Abstract: Although there is emergent evidence illustrating neural sensitivity to cannabis cues in canna-
bis users, the specificity of this effect to cannabis cues as opposed to a generalized hyper-sensitivity to
hedonic stimuli has not yet been directly tested. Using fMRI, we presented 53 daily, long-term canna-
bis users and 68 non-using controls visual and tactile cues for cannabis, a natural reward, and, a
sensory-perceptual control object to evaluate brain response to hedonic stimuli in cannabis users. The
results showed an interaction between group and reward type such that the users had greater response
during cannabis cues relative to natural reward cues (i.e., fruit) in the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum,
anterior cingulate gyrus, and ventral tegmental area compared to non-users (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3,
P < 0.05). In the users, there were positive brain-behavior correlations between neural response to can-
nabis cues in fronto-striatal-temporal regions and subjective craving, marijuana-related problems, with-
drawal symptoms, and levels of THC metabolites (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05). These findings
demonstrate hyper-responsivity, and, specificity of brain response to cannabis cues in long-term canna-
bis users that are above that of response to natural reward cues. These observations are concordant
with incentive sensitization models suggesting sensitization of mesocorticolimbic regions and disrup-
tion of natural reward processes following drug use. Although the cross-sectional nature of this study
does not provide information on causality, the positive correlations between neural response and indi-
cators of cannabis use (i.e., THC levels) suggest that alterations in the reward system are, in part,
related to cannabis use. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3431–3443, 2016.

INTRODUCTION
The public health relevance of cannabis use is rising with
the changes in legislation in the United States, yet the litera-
ture on the transition to problematic use remains unre-
solved.
One
of
the
central
components
that
underlie
problematic use is craving. Although only a handful of pub-
lished studies have investigated the neural mechanisms
underlying craving for cannabis, findings of greater neural
response in mesocorticolimbic areas during exposure to can-
nabis cues have been consistent across different populations
of cannabis users [Cousijn et al., 2013a]; [Charboneau, et al.,
2013]; [Filbey et al., 2009a]; [Goldman et al., 2013; Lundahl

 and Johanson, 2011]. This neural response has been related
to symptoms of cannabis use disorder (CUD), although, a
direct link to the subjective experience of craving has not
yet been reported [Cousijn et al., 2013a; Filbey et al., 2009a;
Goldman et al., 2013; Lundahl and Johanson, 2011]. Never-
theless, existing studies corroborate the link between greater
mesocorticolimbic brain response during exposure to canna-
bis cues that is related to CUD, suggesting increased motiva-
tional processing associated with drug-seeking behavior in
CUDs. Increased motivational processing to other salient
stimuli, such as monetary reward, has also been found in
cannabis users [Cousijn et al., 2013b; Filbey et al., 2013; Nes-
tor et al., 2010; Yip et al., 2014; van Hell et al., 2010]. How-
ever, because money may be associated with cannabis and
could be a secondary cue for cannabis, the specificity of
increased motivational processing to cannabis rather than a
generalized hyper-responsivity to all rewards has yet to be
directly examined. A study by Wetherill et al. [2014] com-
paring neural response to subliminal cannabis cues with
subliminal sexual images found greater response to the sub-
liminally presented cannabis cues relative to the sexual
images
in
the
insula,
ventral
striatum,
and
amygdala
[Wetherill et al., 2014]. It is, therefore, possible that similarly
greater response to explicitly presented cannabis cues rela-
tive to appetitive cues would be expected.
In this study, to determine how cannabis use relates to
potential disruptions in the brain’s natural reward proc-
esses, we tested the specificity of neural response to canna-
bis cues relative to natural rewards in long-term, heavy
cannabis users, and non-using controls. Based on incentive
sensitization models of addiction that propose that drugs
sensitize mesocorticolimbic regions and disrupt or seg-
ment natural reward processes [Hyman and Malenka,
2001; Robinson and Berridge, 2000] as well as from find-
ings by Wetherill et al [2014], we hypothesized that canna-
bis users will show greater fMRI BOLD response when
exposed to explicitly presented cannabis cues that will be
above and beyond response (1) to cues for natural rewards
and (2) in non-users. Greater activation is expected in mes-
ocorticolimbic regions that regulate motivation, executive
function, and reward processing. Lastly, given the existing
literature
showing
associations
between
the
brain’s
response to cues and cannabis use behaviors, we also
expected that this pattern of neural activation would be
related to subjective craving as well as behavioral meas-
ures of cannabis use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the University of Texas at
Dallas and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Cen-
ter Institutional Review Boards. This study was conducted
according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of
Helsinki. All participants provided informed written con-
sent to participate in the study and were provided mone-
tary compensation for their participation.
Participants
Fifty nine regular cannabis users and 70 non-users par-
ticipated in this study. The study’s inclusion criteria were:
right-handedness, English as the primary language, absence
of current or history of psychosis, traumatic brain injury,
and MRI contraindications (e.g., pregnancy, non-removal
metallic implants, claustrophobia). All of the participants
were screened via urinalysis for other drugs of abuse and
were excluded if drugs (other than cannabis) were detected.
Participants were excluded for regular tobacco use as
defined by smoking more than a pack of cigarettes a month
as well as current alcohol dependence based on the Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) [First et al.,
1997]. Cannabis users were recruited based on self-reported
history of regular cannabis use with a minimum of 5,000
lifetime occasions, as well as daily use over the preceding
60 days. Verification of cannabis use was conducted via
quantification of THC metabolites as ng/ml (over creati-
nine) via gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectroscopy
(MS). The non-using controls were recruited based on the
absence of daily cannabis use at any period in their lifetime,
in addition to no current illicit drug use in the past 60 days.
Behavioral Data
We collected (1) the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire
(MCQ) [Heishman et al., 2001] to measure basal level crav-
ing for cannabis immediately prior to and after the MRI
scan and, (2) the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist, (MWC)
[Budney et al., 1999] to measure self-reported withdrawal
symptoms immediately prior to the MRI scan, and, (3) the
Marijuana Problems Survey (MPS) [Stephens et al., 2000]
to measure problems associated with cannabis use. Infor-
mation pertaining to self-reported grams of cannabis use
per day was also obtained from the cannabis users.
Behavioral Data Analyses
T-tests and chi-square tests were used in SPSS 21 for
descriptive purposes as well as to compare the groups on
demographic and substance use variables (Table I).
fMRI Data
fMRI scan acquisition
The users were scanned following a 72-h abstinence
from cannabis use. Although there is no reliable measure
of acute abstinence from cannabis, we measured THC
metabolites as ng/ml (over creatinine) (via GC/MS) from
the
participants
before
and
after
approximately
72-h
period to detect reductions in THC metabolites, in addi-
tion to self-report. All participants were asked to abstain
from alcohol for 24 h and from caffeine and cigarettes for
the 2-h before their scheduled scan. Breath alcohol level
was also collected to confirm blood alcohol content of
r Filbey et al. r
r 3432 r
 0.000 at the beginning of the scan. Additionally, all partici-
pants were asked to eat a meal before their scan appoint-
ment to reduce confounding effects of hunger.
Scanning sessions took place in the Advanced Imaging
Research Center (AIRC) on the main University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) campus. MRI images
were collected using a 3T Philips whole body scanner
equipped with Quasar gradient subsystem (40 mT/m ampli-
tude, a slew rate of 220 mT/m/ms). Structural MRI scans
were collected with a MPRAGE sequence with the following
parameters: TR/TE/TI 5 8.2/3.70/1,100 ms, flip angle5 128,
FOV 5 256 3 256 mm, slab thickness5 160 mm (along left-
right direction), voxel size 51 3 1 3 1 mm, total scan time5 3
min 57 s. fMRI scans were collected using a gradient echo,
echo-planar sequence with the intercomissural line (AC-PC)
as a reference (TR: 2.0 s, TE: 29 ms, flip angle: 758, matrix size:
64 3 64, 39 slices, voxel size: 3.44 3 3.44 3 3.5 mm3).
fMRI cannabis cue exposure task
During the fMRI session, the participants completed a can-
nabis cue-exposure task modified from the one previously
described by Filbey et al. [2009b] to include a cue for a natu-
ral reward. The task consisted of two runs, each one with a
different pseudorandom order of visual and tactile presenta-
tions of: (i) a single cannabis cue (six trials), (ii) a single natu-
ral reward cue (six trials), and (iii) a single neutral cue (six
trials). Each cue was presented for twentys. Following the
cue exposure period, we measured momentary subjective
craving by asking the participants to respond to: “Please rate
your urge to use marijuana right now.” Responses were
measured using a scale from zero (no urge at all) to ten
(extremely high urge) (five s). A twenty s washout period
completed each trial. Responses were recorded using a fiber-
optic pad. The participants were pseudorandomly given dif-
ferent orders of the runs (e.g., run A, run B or run B, run A).
We presented task stimuli to the participants based on
their response to “what is your preferred cannabis use
method?” Twenty-three users selected the pipe, eleven
selected the bong, eleven selected the blunt and eight
selected the joint. For the non-users, cannabis parapher-
nalia were matched to what was presented to the users
resulting in Twenty-seven non-users presented with the
pipe, Twenty-two presented with the bong, three pre-
sented with the blunt and eleven presented with the
joint. There was missing information on five of the
participants.
For the natural reward cues, we selected fruit because of
its appetitiveness and because it exists within the natural
environment and would have inherent representations in
the human brain [Filbey et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2015].
Similar to the cannabis cues, we presented participants
with their self-selected fruit stimulus based on the their
response to “what is your preferred fruit?” In the users,
fourteen chose a banana, twelve chose an apple, thirteen
chose an orange, and thirteen chose grapes. In the non-
users, sixteen selected a banana, seventeen selected an
apple, fifteen selected an orange, and twenty selected
grapes. Lastly, similar to the original task, a pencil was
used as a neutral cue for all of the participants.
Stimulus presentations were delivered using E-Prime
(Psychology Software Tools). The timing of the stimulus
presentation was synchronized with trigger pulses from
the magnet to ensure precise temporal integration of stim-
ulus presentation and fMRI data acquisition.

 London, UK). Before starting analyses, the first seven vol-
umes of each EPI run were discarded to allow the MR signal
to reach steady state. Pre-processing of these volumes started
with motion correction using SPM’s realignment module
[Friston et al., 1995]. This was followed by slice timing correc-
tion, which corrected for temporal differences in acquisition
time of the BOLD signal across slices within each volume.
The resultant time series was then smoothed using a 6 mm
full width half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.
First-level analyses
Preprocessed time series for each participant were ana-
lyzed using multiple linear regression as implemented in
FILM (FMRIB’s Improved Linear Model), a component of
FSL. Regressors for the linear model were generated using
FEAT by convolving the cue states (Cue Present, Craving
Rating, Cue Washout) of each cue type (cannabis cues,
neutral object cues and fruit cues) with a double gamma
hemodynamic response function. Parameter estimates for
the regressors were used to generate z-maps based on
three contrasts of interest: Cue ON cannabis versus Cue
ON neutral object; Cue ON cannabis versus Cue ON fruit;
and Cue ON fruit versus Cue ON neutral object.
Group level analyses
Participant contrast maps were registered to their own MRI
T1 weighted MPRAGE structural images, and then co-
registered to the MNI 152 template space using FLIRT
(FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool). Group analysis of
contrasts was performed in FEAT using FLAME (FMRIB’s
Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) to estimate a mixed effects
model of task-related activation differences for each of the three
contrasts of interest (as a Gaussianized t/F statistic). Groups
were defined by cannabis usage status (user/non-user). Con-
trast maps were generated for each usage status. Resulting
maps were height-thresholded at a Z-value of 2.3. We used
FEAT’s cluster-thresholding method, which estimated acti-
vated clusters’ significance level (from Gaussian random field
theory) compared with the cluster probability threshold [Wors-
ley et al., 1996]) of P� 0.05. Because a height-threshold of
z5 2.3 may result in large clusters despite adequately control-
ling for false-positives, we also used a cluster defining voxel
threshold of P� 0.001 per recommendations by Woo et al.
[2014] for the enhancement of anatomical specificity.
In addition to simple group level maps, within the canna-
bis users, group level contrasts were generated for several
variables of interest. To determine the relationship between
the neural response in brain areas and subjective craving,
group maps were regressed separately against total MCQ
scores (baseline craving) and in-scanner cannabis craving
ratings. To determine if the neural response in brain areas
are modulated by cannabis use behavior, group maps were
regressed separately against reported grams of cannabis use
per day and THC/creatinine levels from the abstinent state.
To determine the clinical relevance of the neural response to
cannabis cues, group maps were regressed separately
against MWC scores and MPS scores. We expected positive
associations between neural response to cues and subjective
craving, cannabis use behavior and clinical symptoms of
CUD.
RESULTS
Out of 129 participants, two did not have fMRI data due
to technical problems (incomplete scan, missing behavioral
data), and, six had motion exceeding 3 mm (in translation)
or 38 (in rotation) between TRs during both runs. These
eight participants were subsequently excluded from fur-
ther analyses. Of the remaining 121, the sample consisted
of 53 users and 68 non-users (Table I).
Behavioral Data
Substance use
Among the users, 14 had a DSM-IV diagnosis of current
cannabis dependence based on SCID interview [First et al.,
1997]. Twenty one of the cannabis users and 12 of the non-
users showed some history of alcohol abuse or dependence,
and three users and three non-users showed current symp-
toms of abuse. No users or non-users met criteria for current
abuse or dependence for any other substances, although three
users showed some history of sedative abuse or dependence,
five users some history of abuse or dependence on stimulants,
two users for some history of abuse or dependence on
opioids, five users for some history of abuse or dependence
on cocaine, seven users for history of abuse of hallucinogens,
and one user for abuse of other drugs not specified.
Subjective craving
The cannabis users had a mean baseline (immediately
prior to the MRI scan) MCQ score of 237.04 (SD 5 154.48)
and a post-scan (immediately after the MRI scan) MCQ
score of 250.57 (SD 5 170.65). Although the post-scan MCQ
was greater than baseline MCQ, the difference did not
reach a level of significance (Table I).
In terms of in-scanner cue-induced craving ratings, there
were significant group differences found in response to all
of the stimuli presentations where the cannabis users
reported greater subjective urge to use cannabis following
all stimuli types (P < 0.001) (Table II). Within the cannabis
users, cue-induced craving following cannabis cue expo-
sure was significantly greater relative to following fruit
cue (P < 0.001) and neutral cue (P < 0.001).
fMRI Data
Cannabis cues versus neutral object cues

cue compared to the neutral object cue in the parahippocampal

 gyrus, thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus, mid-cingulate
gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and cer-
ebellum (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 FWE-corrected),
and, a small cluster in response to the neutral object cue
compared to cannabis cue in the lateral occipital cortex,
cuneus and precuneus (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05
FWE-corrected).
The non-users showed significant differences in activa-
tion in response to cannabis cues compared to the neutral
object cues in the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, cau-
date, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, supramarginal
gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and cerebellum (cluster-threshold
z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 FWE-corrected), and to the neutral object
cue compared to the cannabis cue in the lateral occipital
cortex, cuneus, precuneus, and the occipital pole (cluster-
threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 FWE-corrected).
The contrast between groups showed that the cannabis
users had greater response than non-users in several clus-
ters of widespread activation encompassing frontal, cingu-
late, and midbrain (i.e., VTA) areas with peaks in the
precuneus, caudate, anterior and posterior cingulate gyri
in response to cannabis cues compared to the neutral
object
cue
(cluster-threshold
z 5 2.3,
P < 0.05
FWE-
corrected). In the reverse comparison, non-users did not
show a significant difference in response to cannabis cues
compared to the neutral object cue when compared to the
cannabis users (Table III, Fig. 1).
Cannabis cues versus natural reward cues
In the users, exposure to cannabis cues showed greater acti-
vation than exposure to the fruit cue in the anterior cingulate
gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, infe-
rior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and lingual gyrus (clus-
ter-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 FWE-corrected). Response to
fruit cue was also greater than cannabis cue in the cuneus,
precuneus, and middle occipital gyrus (cluster-threshold
z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 FWE-corrected) (Supporting Information).
In the non-users, greater response was found for the fruit
cue compared to the cannabis cue in the lingual gyrus and
precuneus
(cluster-threshold
z 5 2.3,
P < 0.05
FWE-cor-
rected), but not in the reverse comparison (Supporting
Information).
The contrast between the groups showed that the canna-
bis users showed greater response to cannabis cues com-
pared to the fruit cues in several clusters of widespread
activation encompassing frontal, cingulate, and midbrain
(i.e., VTA) areas with peaks in the posterior cingulate
gyrus and medial frontal gyrus (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3,
P < 0.05 FWE-corrected), whereas the non-users did not
have significantly greater response to cannabis cues versus
fruit cues. These differences are attributable to greater esti-
mated activation during the cannabis cue exposure rather
than reductions in activation during the fruit cue exposure
(Table III, Fig. 1).
Fruit cues versus neutral object cues
In users, there was greater response to the fruit cue
compared to the neutral object cue in the thalamus, claus-
trum, and cerebellum (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05
FWE-corrected), and, in lateral occipital cortex, cuneus and
precuneus for the reverse contrast (i.e., neutral object cue
compared to fruit cue) (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05
FWE-corrected).
In non-users, robust response was found for the fruit
cue compared to the neutral object cue in the posterior cin-
gulate gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, thalamus, and cere-
bellum (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 FWE-corrected),
and a smaller response in the occipital cortex, centered on
the cuneus at cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 (FWE-cor-
rected), for the neutral object cue compared to the fruit
cue.
No significant difference was detected between cannabis
users and non-users when comparing fruit cue and neutral
object cues at the selected threshold.
Brain-Behavior Correlations
Subjective craving
Because the cannabis users reported more craving after all
of the cue types compared to the non-users, we correlated the
BOLD response to cues with net in-scanner craving ratings
(craving ratings for cannabis cues minus ratings during appe-
titive or neutral control cues) to normalize the subjective crav-
ing ratings. The results showed that in the cannabis users,
there were significant positive correlations between in-
scanner cue-induced craving ratings for cannabis cues (minus
ratings during appetitive or neutral control cues) in amygdala
and striatum (cannabis > neutral), frontal and insula regions
(fruit> cannabis) and regions in frontal, temporal, striatum,
and insula (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 FWE-corrected)
(Table IV). MCQ scores was positively correlated with
response to cannabis cues (vs. fruit cue) in the right superior

For the contrast of cannabis cues versus fruit cue, we
found significant correlations between THC/creatinine lev-

related to task-related activation for cannabis cues (vs.
neutral object).
Clinical symptoms of cannabis use
In the cannabis users, response to cannabis cues (vs.
neutral cue) positively correlated with MPS scores in the
superior temporal gyrus, Heschl’s gyrus, and planum tem-
porale (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 FWE-corrected)
(See Supporting Information). For the contrast of cannabis

and right inferior parietal, but not SCID IV CUD symptom
count (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 FWE-corrected)
(Table V and Fig. 2).
Post Hoc Analyses
To interrogate the relationship between BOLD response to
cues and subjective craving, we tested the neural response to
cues while taking subjective craving related differences into
account. In other words, we analyzed between group differ-
ences in response to cues while controlling for in-scanner
craving score. The results showed that, users had greater
response during cannabis (vs. neutral cue) than non-users in
the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus (cluster-thresh-
old z5 2.3, P� 0.05 FWE-corrected). Users were also greater
than non-users during cannabis� fruit cue in the anterior
cingulate gyrus (cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, P� 0.05 FWE-
corrected).
Last, we tested potential confounding effects of individual
factors. Since there was a large degree of variability in alcohol
use, we examined the effects of alcohol on the responses by add-
ing alcohol drinks per drinking day as a covariate of no interest.
The findings of greater activation in users versus non-users in
the cannabis versus neutral cue and cannabis versus fruit com-
parisons remained despite controlling for alcohol use suggesting
that these effects are specific to cannabis (see Supporting Infor-
mation). The groups also differed in education; therefore, we
also performed analyses to determine potential effects of educa-
tion in response to cannabis cues. We found no confounding
effect of education in the cannabis versus neutral cue and canna-
bis versus fruit comparisons (See Supporting Information).
DISCUSSION
To address the question of whether cannabis sensitizes
and disrupts mesocorticolimbic reward processes, we com-
pared the neural response to cannabis cues to that of natural
reward cues (i.e., fruit cues), which are inherently salient and
represented in the brain’s reward system. Our findings
showed enhanced response in the mesocorticolimbic-reward
system in cannabis users that is specific to cannabis, rather
than a generalized hyper-responsivity to all rewarding stim-
uli. This response was also associated with subjective craving
(basal and cue-induced), THC metabolite levels as well as
clinical symptoms of CUD (withdrawal and problems related
to cannabis use).
The critical tension in the literature surrounds whether
cannabis use may be due to a general reward-centricity in
individuals or whether neural plasticity following sub-
stance abuse enhances this reward response that thereby
promotes continued cannabis use. Incentive sensitization
theories posit that drugs of abuse sensitize the brain’s nat-
ural reward pathway [Robinson and Berridge, 2000]. In
this light, alterations in the reward pathway may be due
to neural sensitization that leads to greater attribution of
incentive salience to drug-related stimuli. Our results
showing greater response to cannabis cues in cannabis
users relative to non-users are aligned with this theory.
Furthermore, the observed effect is specific to cannabis

 suggesting a direct effect of cannabis exposure on hyper-
responsivity
of
the
reward
system, which
is
in line
with findings by [Wetherill et al., 2014]. Specifically, we
found greater response to cannabis cues over fruit cue
in the users but not the non-users in areas within the
mesocorticolimbic-reward pathway (OFC, striatum, ante-
rior cingulate gyrus, ventral tegmental area) in addition to
the precuneus. Notably, activation in the anterior cingulate
gyrus was also observed when controlling for in-scanner
subjective craving ratings, suggesting that the difference
found between groups in the anterior cingulate gyrus is
related to subjective craving differences between users and
non-users. These regions underlie processes relevant for
encoding of learned association of the drug with relevant
cues and, therefore, for evaluation of motivational salience
[Filbey and DeWitt, 2012]. In terms of the precuneus,
emergent studies suggest its role of processing externally-
driven, self-relevant information, which in response to
cannabis cues, would indicate a hyper-arousal to the con-
ditioned cues [DeWitt et al., 2015]. Because these areas are
related to processing of general hedonic stimuli including
food [Filbey et al., 2012a; Jiang et al., 2015], greater activa-
tion in response to cannabis cues in a system that repre-
sents inherently salient stimuli suggests a disruption in the
natural reward system.
This pattern of neural response was associated with both
basal subjective craving as well as cue-induced subjective
craving in reward as well as interoception regions (cluster-
threshold z 5 2.3, P < 0.05 FWE-corrected) (Table IV). This
correlation emerged despite the finding that cannabis users
had greater subjective craving for cannabis when exposed to
all types of cues (cannabis, natural reward, and, neutral) rel-
ative to non-users. Notably, the temporal analysis of the in-
scanner craving rating scores (i.e., trial-by-trial rating for all
cues) did not show persisting craving over time (Supporting
Information). That is, trials of cannabis cue exposure do not
elevate subsequent subjective craving responses during can-
nabis, neutral or natural cues.
How this enhanced pattern of neural response to cues
relates to cannabis use behavior was demonstrated by pos-
itive correlations between response to cannabis in several
regions and behavioral measures of cannabis use. These
positive associations suggest that the greater number of
withdrawal symptoms, and, THC levels, the greater the
neural response to cues that are greater than that of
response to fruit cues. Problems related to cannabis use
was also positively associated with neural response to
cues further indicating specificity of these brain alterations
to processes related to cannabis exposure that could be a
marker of transition from recreational use to problematic
use.
The significance of these studies is in determining the
mechanisms that result in the transition toward problem-
atic cannabis use. Thus, how individuals process cannabis
relative to non-drug rewards not only advance our knowl-
edge of these underlying mechanisms but also inform ave-
nues
for
potential
interventions.
The
knowledge
that
cannabis users are hyper-responsive to cannabis due to the
possibility
of
sensitization
and
disruption
of
natural
reward processes suggests that behavioral interventions
that target unconscious mechanisms may be more effec-
tive. Additionally, treatment schedules should correspond
to the long recovery from sensitization that diminishes
slowly and allows the potential for relapse.
Limitations and Conclusions
The cross-sectional nature of this study does not address
directionality of these effects. However, the correlation
between patterns of greater activation for cannabis cues
relative to non-cannabis cues with measures of cannabis
use behavior (THC levels) suggests that cannabis use is
related to these changes. There are other aspects of craving
that were beyond the scope of this study but should be
noted for future directions. First, variations in reward
expectancies may have confounded our observed effects.

Loci of significant correlations in the cannabis users between total scores on the (a) Marijuana Craving Questionnaire (MCQ), (b) With-
drawal Checklist (MWC), and (c) THC ng/mL (over creatinine) for the cannabis cues versus fruit cues contrast at a z-value threshold of
2.3 and GRF cluster-corrected P-value of exceeding 0.05. Cluster size in terms of number of voxels, Z values for peak voxels along with
corresponding MNI coordinates, anatomical localization, and Brodmann areas are provided.

Correlations between cannabis cue (vs. fruit cue) and Marijuana
Craving Questionnaire (MCQ), Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist
(MWC), creatinine-weighted THC ng/ml in cannabis users.
Crosshairs depict the peaks in users for the correlation with
(A) right post-central gyrus and MCQ scores (B) right fusiform
gyrus and MWC scores, (C) right lingual gyrus and THC levels
(over creatinine). The scatterplots show the relationship of
Gaussianized t-scores at the peak with each behavioral measure
(cluster-threshold z 5 2.3, FWE P < 0.05).
 Future studies should examine the direct effect of expect-
ancies to determine how neural response to cannabis cues
may be predictive of use. Second, future studies should
measure reward valuation of stimuli to fully characterize
the hedonic response to cannabis cues.
To conclude, this study shows that (1) cannabis activates
the brain’s reward pathway more than natural rewards,
and, (2) cannabis is associated with a divergent pattern of
natural reward system processes in daily and long-term
cannabis using adults. The relationship between response
to cannabis cues and self-reported marijuana problems
suggests that this mechanism underlies the transition to
problematic use or dependence via increased sensitivity to
cannabis cues. These findings indicate that cannabis use
may be associated with sensitization of mesocorticolimbic
regions as well as disruptions of natural reward processes
and lay the foundation for the development of more
potent interventions that target this pathway.
