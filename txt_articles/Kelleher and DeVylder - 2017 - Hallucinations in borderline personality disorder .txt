 There has been extensive epidemiological research on psychotic
experiences in the population over the past decade.1,2 These are
hallucinations and delusions that occur across a spectrum of
reality testing, on a continuum with the symptoms of psychotic
disorder but not necessarily reaching a full psychotic level of
intensity. Whereas initial research in this area focused on an
associated increased risk for psychotic disorder, more recent
research has demonstrated that hallucinations are also associated
with
a
wide
range
of
affective,
anxiety
and
behavioural
disorders.3,4 In contrast to extensive epidemiological research on
common mental disorders, there has been a lack of epidemiological
research to date on hallucinations and personality disorders, aside

disorders.
It
is,
in
particular,
important
to
consider
the
relationship between hallucinations and borderline personality
disorder (BPD), which was so named for the psychoanalytic
construct of a disorder on the ‘borderline’ between neurosis and
psychosis. The psychoanalytic ‘borderline’ concept has been
superseded by an operationalised diagnosis in the DSM; however,
psychotic experiences are still recognised as an important feature
of BPD5 and, among individuals presenting to clinic with BPD,
prevalences of psychotic symptoms have been reported of between
20 and 50%.5 One recent population-based study demonstrated a
link between hallucinations/delusions and mood instability,6 one
of nine traits of BPD as defined in DSM-5. However, to our
knowledge, there has been no research to date to look at the
prevalence of BPD among individuals with hallucinations from
either a categorical perspective (i.e. reaching full diagnostic criteria
for BPD) or a continuum perspective (i.e. varying numbers of
BPD traits not necessarily meeting full BPD criteria).
Using the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS), a
nationally representative study of mental health in England, we
investigated the following: (a) the prevalence of hallucinations
in individuals with BPD compared with individuals with a range
of common mental disorders; (b) the prevalence of BPD among a
community sample of individuals with hallucinations; (c) the
correlation between BPD traits and hallucinations.
Method
Full details of the survey methodology are available in the study
report.7 In brief, a stratified, multistage probability sample of
households in England was carried out in 2007 to recruit a
nationally representative sample of participants aged 16 years
and older. The Clinical Interview Schedule8 was used by trained
interviewers from the National Social Research Centre to assess for
DSM-IV Axis-I disorders.9 BPD traits were assessed using the
structured interview for DSM disorders (SCID II) questionnaire.10
In total, 7403 individuals took part in the study (response 57%).
The study was approved by the Royal Free Hospital and Medical
School Research Ethics Committee.
The Psychosis Screening Questionnaire11 was used to assess
for hallucinations. We previously showed that survey items on
auditory
and
visual
hallucinations
demonstrated
the
best
sensitivity and specificity not just for predicting hallucinations
but for psychotic experiences in general (compared with clinical
interview).12 Therefore, the item in the study that we used was:
‘Over the past year, have there been times when you heard or
saw things that other people couldn’t?’
Statistical analyses
Data were analysed using Stata (version 11.2 for Windows). We
used logistic regression to examine the relationship between
hallucinations and a diagnosis of each mental disorder or BPD.
We used point biserial correlation to examine the relationship
between hallucinations and number of BPD traits. Reported
prevalences are weighted using the APMS study sampling weights
to account for individual-level sampling factors of the study,7 and
analyses were adjusted for gender and socioeconomic status.
Results
The weighted prevalence of hallucinations in the population was
4.3% (n = 323). Women and men did not differ in hallucination
prevalence (w2 = 0.95, P40.05). The weighted prevalence of BPD
in the population was 0.4% (n = 16). Three-quarters of individuals
with BPD (n = 12) also had at least one mental disorder. Men and
women did not differ in the prevalence of BPD (w2 = 4.16,
P40.05) but BPD traits were significantly more prevalent in
women than in men (t = 2.19, P= 0.029).
The prevalence of current mental disorders among all
individuals with hallucinations was 22%, compared with a
prevalence of 7% in individuals who did not have hallucinations
(odds ratio (OR) = 3.67, 95% CI 2.71–4.97). Specifically, among
individuals with hallucinations, 10.7% had generalised anxiety
disorder, 9.7% had depression, 6.5% had agoraphobia, 4.3% had
obsessive–compulsive disorder, 4.1% had social phobia, 4% had
panic disorder and 3.9% had a specific phobia. The prevalence

Hallucinations in borderline personality disorder
and common mental disorders

Summary
Hallucinations are classically associated with psychotic
disorders. Recent research, however, has highlighted that
hallucinations frequently occur outside of the context of
psychosis. Despite this, to our knowledge, there has been no
epidemiological research to compare the prevalence of
hallucinations across common mental disorders with the
prevalence in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Using
data from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (n = 7403),
we investigated the prevalence of hallucinations in individuals
with a range of mental disorders and BPD. Hallucinations
were prevalent in all disorders (range 11–24%). Hallucinations
were no more prevalent in individuals with BPD (13.7%) than
in individuals with a (non-psychotic) mental disorder (12.6%)
(w2 = 0.03, P = 0.92).

Short report
 of BPD among all individuals with hallucinations was 1.3%
(OR = 3.20, 95% CI 0.69–14.78).
The prevalence of hallucinations in individuals with mental
disorders, by comparison, varied from a low of 10.5% (generalised
anxiety disorder) to a high of 24.2% (agoraphobia) (Table 1).
Overall, 12.6% of individuals with a mental disorder reported
hallucinations, compared with 3.7% of individuals who did not
have a mental disorder (OR = 3.66, 95% CI 2.71–4.96). The
prevalence of hallucinations in individuals with BPD was 13.7%
(OR = 4.62, 95% CI 1.30–16.39), which did not differ from the
prevalence in those with mental disorders (12.6%, w2 = 0.03,
P = 0.92). Looking at a continuous score of BPD traits in the total
sample, the correlation between hallucinations and BPD was
statistically significant but was weak (r = 0.195, P50.001).
Discussion
Using a large, population sample, we found that (a) the prevalence
of BPD in individuals with hallucinations was low (1.3%); (b) the
prevalence of mental disorders in individuals with hallucinations
was high, most notably for generalised anxiety disorder (11%)
and depression (10%); (c) the prevalence of hallucinations in
individuals with BPD (13.7%) did not differ significantly from the
prevalence of hallucinations in individuals with a common mental
disorder (12.6%); and (d) the correlation between hallucinations
and BPD traits was weak (although statistically significant). An
important nosological finding of the study was that, despite being
named for being on a borderline between neurosis and psychosis,
hallucinations were, in fact, no more prevalent in BPD than in
most ‘neurotic’ mental disorders. In fact, the prevalence of
hallucinations in BPD was higher only relative to one of the seven
neurotic disorders assessed (generalised anxiety disorder).
There
have
been
few
empirical
studies
to
date
on
hallucinations in clinical samples with BPD, although these have
typically shown higher prevalences of psychotic experiences in
general than the current study.5 There may be a number of reasons
for this. For one, this could be attributable to Berkson’s bias,
whereby when individuals with BPD have hallucinations they
are more likely to attend mental health services relative to, for
example,
individuals
with
an
anxiety
disorder
who
have
hallucinations. This would create a (false) impression that BPD
is inherently associated with a higher prevalence of hallucinations.
We plan to investigate this in future research. It may also be the
case that individuals with BPD more readily disclose their
hallucinations in mental health clinics, without necessarily being
asked in detail about these symptoms, compared with individuals
with neurotic disorders. The results of the current study, however,
suggest that individuals with neurotic disorders do, in fact, report
hallucinations at least as frequently when they are specifically
questioned about these.
Strengths of the current report include a large sample size, a
nationally representative sample, a validated measure of hallucin-
ations and assessment of personality disorders conducted by
trained clinicians. The prevalence of BPD in this study was
relatively low compared with some international studies;13 the
reasons for this are unclear. However, we also had a continuous
measure of BPD traits in the full population sample and results
of both categorical and continuum analyses were consistent.
In conclusion, a very small minority of individuals with
hallucinations have BPD – 1%, compared with 11% who had a
generalised anxiety disorder and 10% who had a depressive
disorder. Despite clinical anecdotes to the contrary, when
systematically assessed, hallucinations were no more prevalent in
individuals with BPD than they were in those with most
(neurotic) mental disorders.
