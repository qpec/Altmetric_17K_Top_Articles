The amygdala is a key brain area regulating responses to stress and
emotional stimuli, so improving our understanding of how it is regulated
could offer novel strategies for treating disturbances in emotion regulation.
As we review here, a growing body of evidence indicates that the gut
microbiota may contribute to a range of amygdala-dependent brain functions
from pain sensitivity to social behavior, emotion regulation, and therefore,
psychiatric health. In addition, it appears that the microbiota is necessary for
normal development of the amygdala at both the structural and functional
levels. While further investigations are needed to elucidate the exact
mechanisms of microbiota-to-amygdala communication, ultimately, this work
raises the intriguing possibility that the gut microbiota may become a viable
treatment target in disorders associated with amygdala dysregulation,
including visceral pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, and beyond. Also see

1. Introduction: The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis
Scientific perspective on the regulation of neural and psycho-
logical processes is now expanding beyond the brain to
incorporate an understanding of the brain’s interactions with
other systems. In particular, a recent surge of interest in the gut-
brain axis, and its regulation by the microbiome, has produced
an ever-growing evidence base supporting the idea that the gut
microbiota can alter both brain and behav-
ior.[1–5] In this review, we will focus on the
impact of the gut microbiota on the
amygdala because this small, almond-
shaped brain region is a key regulator of
many of the functions found to be altered
by microbiota-gut-brain axis perturbations.
While the investigation of the relationship
between the microbiota and the amygdala
is still relatively in its infancy, the early
evidence suggests that both the structure
and function of the amygdala can be
influenced by the gut microbiota.
In daily life, we use common phrases
such as “butterflies in my stomach” or “I
have a gut feeling” to articulate our
intuitions, the first warning signs when
something is wrong. This concept that the
gut
can
reveal,
or
even
predict,
our
thoughts
and feelings is one that is
ingrained in our psyche and is now gaining the attention it
deserves in the scientific literature. In this context, the term “gut-
brain axis” was coined to describe the bidirectional communica-
tion links between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Over
the last two decades, this concept has been expanded to become
the microbiota-gut-brain axis, in recognition of the accumulating
preclinical data implicating the gut microbiota (the trillions of
microorganisms within our gut) in this bidirectional communi-
cation.[1] Indeed, current evidence points to an influence of the
gut microbiota in central nervous system (CNS) function,
appropriate brain development, as well as psychological and
behavioral outcomes.[1–5]
There are many approaches available to chart the impact of the
gut microbiome on CNS function albeit many are used much
more in preclinical than human studies.[1,6] These include
dietary manipulations, administration of specific strains of
bacteria (e.g., probiotics), interventions which support the
growth of beneficial bacteria (e.g., prebiotics), germ free
(microbiota deficient) mice, antibiotic treatments, C-section
delivery,
and
fecal
microbiota
transplants.
To
date,
the
investigation of the effects of these microbiota manipulations
on brain function has been difficult to map to specific brain
regions. In particular, germ-free facilities impose substantial
logistical restrictions on experimental protocols and access to
specialized behavioral equipment within the germ free envi-
ronment.[7] Thus far, the use of microbial manipulations to test
for brain region-specific effects has largely focused on the
hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.[8–12] However, we are

manipulations may also have implications for the amygdala.
2. The Amygdala
The amygdala derives its name from its small, almond-like
shape. Its small size belies its influence: it is considered to be one
of the most important regions within the limbic system and
there is a rich history of scientific investigation into its role in
emotion processing and behavior modulation.[13,14] It is also
surprisingly complex in structure, being composed of several
networked regions that have different connectivities, neuro-
chemical characteristics, and cyto-architecture.[15] There is some
debate over exactly how to define these regions but it is generally
agreed that there are at least 13 sub-nuclei that can be grouped,
according to their embryological origins, into the centromedial
(central [CeA] & medial [MeA]), basolateral (basal/basolateral
[BLA] & lateral [LA]), and cortical nuclei (CoA; see Figure 1).[15]
From its central location in the temporal lobe, the amygdaloid
complex is highly connected with several brain regions. It
receives sensory inputs from the thalamus and cortical areas as
well as extensive inputs from other regions in the limbic system,
including the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus,[15] both of
which are markedly altered in germ-free (GF) animals.[10,12,16] In
fact, the connectivity between these three major regions, not just
the function of the individual structures, is fundamental to
appropriate emotional responses.[17] Although tracer studies
have shown afferents reaching all amygdala nuclei, sensory
inputs often reach the amygdala through the LA while inputs
from other brain regions target primarily the LA and BLA. From
here, numerous and complex intra-amygdaloid projections allow
substantial communication between subdivisions, often follow-
ing a lateral to medial direction until signals reach the CeA, from
which the majority of efferent projections originate.[15] These
efferent projections connect the amygdala to a wide variety of
brain areas such as the brainstem, cortical areas, and subcortical
nuclei including the hypothalamus and bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis.[15,17]
The amygdaloid complex undergoes ongoing development
well into postnatal life. Rodent studies have demonstrated that
the soma size and number of dendritic spines on BLA neurons
reach adult levels by early adolescence, while there are ongoing
changes in dendritic morphology into adulthood that parallel
electrophysiological maturation of neurons in this region.[18] In
humans, imaging studies have shown that total amygdala
volume peaks in preadolescence (9–11 years of age).[19] The
complex connectivity of the amygdala with other brain regions
also continues to develop and mature at least into early
adulthood.[20] This ongoing postnatal development, in combina-
tion with the high density of glucocorticoid receptors in the
amygdala, renders it vulnerable to the effects of stress,
particularly during early development and aging.[21] Of note,
these timeframes coincide with periods of low diversity and
instability in the microbiota.[6,22,23] Although there are differ-
ences between humans and rodents in the specific taxonomic
changes that contribute to age-related shifts in the micro-
biota,[22,23] the parallel periods of vulnerability in the amygdala
and microbiota are observed across species, suggesting that
these are key times for these structures to be mutually influential
(see Figure 2).
2.1. Amygdala Dysfunction Is a Characteristic Feature of
Stress-Related Psychiatric Disorders
2.1.1. The Amygdala Is a Critical Regulator of Fear, Stress,
and Anxiety Disorders
Fear and anxiety are overlapping, threat-related emotions that
are mediated by similar neurocircuits.[13] The basic components
of this fear circuitry are well preserved across species and center

(CeA), medial (MeA), and cortical (CoA) nuclei, and the intercalated cells (I). Major afferent signals reach the amygdala predominantly through the BLA
and LA, while efferent signals mediating behavioral outputs tend to originate from the CeA. It is currently unknown how signals from the microbiota
(such as microbial metabolites, including tryptophan/serotonin derivatives, peptidoglycans, immune mediators, and short-chain fatty acids) might
reach the amygdala but there are several possible pathways, as highlighted here.

 around the amygdala.[13,14] Different nuclei within the amygdala
appear to process diverse aspects of learned fear. For example,
the BLA is critical for most learned fear tasks (although perhaps
not contextual fear conditioning), while the CeA is considered
essential for retrieval of learned fear and the MeA is necessary
for learning of aversive associations.[15] The amygdala, and
particularly the BLA, is also involved in the development of
anxiety-like behavior.[13,17] Imaging studies of clinical popula-
tions show that patients with post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and other anxiety disorders exhibit increased activation
of the amygdala
[24] but reduced resting state connectivity
between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex.[17] Amygdalar
expression of microRNAs also appears to be involved in the
modulation of anxiety-like behavior.[25]
Fear and anxiety are commonly exacerbated by chronic
stress.[21] The amygdala appears to have a role in mediating this
relationship, and lesions of the central amygdala prevent the
manifestation of stress-related anxiety.[26] Chronic stress upre-
gulates amygdala activity in rodents and this excitatory state
is linked with dendritic remodeling, including a persistent
expansion of basolateral dendrites.[27] Hypertrophy of the
amygdala is also observed in humans and non-human primates
that have experienced prolonged exposure to stress.[28,29] Such
changes in amygdala structure are likely to compound the
effects of ongoing stress because the amygdala has an important
role in regulating the body’s hormonal stress response via the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous
system.[27]
2.1.2. Mood Disorders and Amygdala Function
While traditionally the amygdala has been mostly associated
with fear and anxiety, it also plays an important role in other
stress-related
disorders.
Studies
using
rodent
models
of
depression indicate that the amygdala undergoes dendritic
remodeling and alterations in synaptic plasticity in depressed
animals.[30] Clinically, increased activity in the amygdala, which
is also seen in GF animals (see section below), has been found
in bipolar disorder and major depression.[31] This relationship
between amygdala activity and mood begins early in life;
amygdala reactivity to negative facial expressions has been
correlated with higher severity of depression in pre-schoolers.[32]
Additionally, reduced amygdala-frontal connectivity has been
associated with depression in both children[33] and adult
women.[34]
2.1.3. Role of Amygdala in Neurodevelopmental Disorders and
Social Behavior
Many neurodevelopmental disorders are also associated with
amygdala abnormalities. Alterations in the volume, activity, and/
or connectivity of the amygdala (features influenced by the gut
microbiota)[16,35–37] have been reported in individuals diagnosed
with schizophrenia,[38,39] attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD),[40] and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).[41,42] In
particular, functional dysregulation of the amygdala is consid-
ered central to the social deficits observed in individuals with
ASD.[43] Although this “amygdala theory of autism” has been
challenged by some,[44] there is certainly evidence that the
amygdala has relevance for the development of social behavior
and socio-emotional processing across species. Amygdala
lesions in humans and non-human primates seem to diminish
social inhibition and limit social perception, increasing social
interaction and interfering with adherence to social norms.[45,46]
In ASD, enlarged amygdala volumes during infancy have been
associated with the severity of social and communicative
Figure 2. Overlapping timelines of sensitivity to environmental insult or intervention for the amygdala and gut microbiota across the lifespan. The
composition of the microbiota is both simple and unstable early in life. During childhood, the microbiota stabilizes and becomes more complex over
development, until it begins to destabilize once more during the aging process. Similarly, the amygdala undergoes ongoing development in the postnatal
period, extending into late adolescence or early adulthood, and is vulnerable during both early and late life. Early-life vulnerability of the microbiota and
amygdala also overlaps with the typical age of onset of many psychiatric disorders.

 impairments.[47] Functionally, hyperactivity of the amygdala has
been reported in ASD populations during social tasks.[48]
Unfortunately, very few imaging studies in humans have
examined the amygdala at the level of its subdivisions, but
one investigation of adults with ASD revealed complex patterns
of atypical functional connectivity between various sub-regions
of the amygdala and other brain regions.[42]
2.1.4. Amygdala Regulates Affective Responses in Pain and
Irritable Bowel Syndrome
The amygdala also plays a role in the experience of pain, and
particularly in the emotional-affective dimensions of pain
perception.[49] In fact, the laterocapsular division of the central
nucleus (CeA) has been labeled by some as the “nociceptive
amygdala” because of its role in integrating nociceptive inputs
from the brainstem and thalamus with information about the
emotional relevance of pain.[49] Neuronal activity and synaptic
transmission in the CeA become elevated in response to chronic
pain, which has been suggested to enhance nociception and
contribute to the heightened anxiety that often accompanies
persistent pain conditions.[49] Consistent with this interpreta-
tion, experimental activation of the amygdala has been shown to
exacerbate visceral pain in rats.[50]
Given the affective role of the amygdala in pain perception, it is
unsurprising that this region has also been implicated in irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS), a disorder associated with microbiota
alterations[51] and characterized by gastrointestinal discomfort,
visceral pain, and frequent comorbidity with affective dysfunc-
tion.[52] IBS patients exhibit hyperactivity in the amygdala and
connected brain regions both at baseline and in response to
visceral stimulation.[53,54] In some studies at least, sex and genetic
differences have been identified in IBS-induced amygdala
hyperactivity, and stronger effects are observed in males[55] and
those with a particular polymorphism of the serotonin receptor
gene, HTR3A.[56] Overall, amygdala hyperactivity seems to be
related to chronic visceral hypersensitivity, pointing to another
important link between the gut and the amygdala.
3. The Microbiota Has Many Potential Routes
of Communication to the Amygdala
Our current understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain axis
suggests that there are a number of plausible routes of
communication from the microbiota to the brain.[1,57] It is not
yet known how microbial signals might travel across the gut-
brain axis to reach the amygdala specifically, however there are
some strong candidate pathways including the vagus nerve,
spinal cord, tryptophan metabolism, and immune modulation
(see Figure 3).
3.1. Microbiota Interacts with the Enteric Nervous System
and Vagus Nerve
The gastrointestinal tract is home not only to a large ecosystem
of microorganisms, it also contains approximately 50, 000
extrinsic and 100 million intrinsic sensory afferent neurons in
the enteric nervous system (ENS).[58] As reviewed elsewhere,[58]
the microbiota can alter neuronal activity within the ENS both
directly and indirectly. Axonal processes on intrinsic primary
afferent neurons extend into the gut mucosa, where they can
interact directly with microbial cell components (e.g., lipopoly-
saccharide) and microbial metabolites (e.g., serotonin) in the gut
lumen, while indirect microbial communication with the ENS
may occur through enteroendocrine cells, including enterochro-
maffin cells.[59,60]
Signals produced by these microbial-neural interactions may
then reach the brain via the vagus nerve; vagal afferents from the
gastrointestinal tract terminate in the nucleus tractus solitarius
(NTS).[61] Confirming this pathway, the behavioral and neural
Figure 3. Potential pathways for microbiota-to-amygdala communica-
tion. There are a number of established pathways of communication
between the microbiota and the brain, which include the circulation (via
microbial
metabolites,
e.g.,
tryptophan/serotonin
derivatives,
and
immune cells), the vagus nerve (via the immune and enteric nervous
systems), and the spinal cord. The vagus nerve and spinal cord terminate
in the brain stem, from which signals may be relayed to the amygdala via
different pathways, as shown here. LC, locus coeruleus; NTS, nucleus
tractus solitarius; PGi, nucleus paragigantocellularis.

 actions of certain probiotic strains are abolished if the vagus
nerve is severed (a procedure known as a vagotomy).[4,62] From
the NTS, there are both direct and indirect noradrenergic
projections to the amygdala (see Figure 3).[61] Thus, visceral
information collected by the vagus nerve may ultimately
influence amygdala activity. Indeed, vagus nerve stimulation
has been shown to stimulate the release of norepinephrine in
the amygdala[63] and to modulate amygdala-prefrontal cortex
connectivity while enhancing behavioral outcomes (i.e., reduced
fear/depressive symptoms) in both preclinical models of fear
extinction[64] and clinical investigations of major depressive
disorder.[65] Conversely, disruption of vagal communication by
subdiaphragmatic deafferentation of the vagus nerve has been
shown to impair fear extinction but reduce anxiety-like behavior
in rats.[66]
3.2. Spinal Cord Transmission of Microbiota to Amygdala
Signals
Microbial signals may also be communicated to the CNS
through the spinal cord. This pathway is thought to be
particularly important for the perception of visceral pain
signals.[57] There are a number of different types of afferent
spinal nerve endings that innervate the gastrointestinal tract,
where they may detect the release of neuroactive compounds.[67]
Signals from these neurons may then reach the amygdala via
the brainstem (spinoparabrachial pathway) and the thalamus
(spinothalamic pathway).[68] Importantly, it is now known that
the gut microbiota can directly produce many neurotransmitters
used for communication in the ENS and CNS (e.g., gamma-
aminobutyric acid [GABA], norepinephrine, dopamine, acetyl-
choline, serotonin) and stimulate the production of others.[69]
Bacterial modulation of spinal cord responses has been
demonstrated using probiotic species; the presence of live
Lactobacillus reuteri reduces spinal nerve firing in response to the
introduction of painful visceral stimulation.[70]
3.3. Microbiota Regulates Tryptophan Metabolism
One key pathway for neurotransmitter production that is highly
influenced by the microbiota is the metabolism of tryptophan.
Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is obtained from
dietary proteins and is metabolized primarily into kynurenine
or serotonin.[71] Serotonin is well-known as a neurotransmitter
involved in mood and cognition, and disruption of the
serotonergic system is a key feature of anxiety and mood
disorders, for which the first-line therapeutics are selective
serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs). In addition to its mood
regulatory function, serotonin has an important role in
gastrointestinal function and is thought to facilitate communi-
cation throughout the gut-brain axis.[71] In fact, the vast majority
of the body’s serotonin is produced in the gastrointestinal tract
by enterochromaffin cells.[71]
Recent studies highlight the role of the microbiota in
modulating both serotonin secretion and tryptophan metabo-
lism in humans and rodents.[72–75] To this end, GF animals
exhibit striking alterations in circulating tryptophan levels and
serotonergic neurotransmission, at least in the hippocam-
pus.[10,76] Similarly, alterations in the microbiota in a murine
model of autism are associated with deficient tryptophan
metabolism and gastrointestinal dysfunction.[77] Prebiotic and
probiotic treatments have been shown to alter central levels of
serotonin or serotonin receptors in the hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex, both regions that are highly connected to the
amygdala.[11,73] This could have an important influence on the
amygdala, where serotonin signaling regulates activity and
synaptic plasticity, guiding the structure’s response to emotional
stimuli.[78] Modulation of peripheral serotonin availability via
dietary tryptophan depletion has been shown to increase
amygdala activation during emotion recognition tasks in
humans.[79] Furthermore, dietary tryptophan depletion enhances
functional connectivity between the amygdala and the prefrontal
cortex.[80]
3.4. Immune Modulation Is a Key Communication Pathway
in the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis
The microbiota is crucial for the establishment and develop-
ment of the immune system.[81] When the microbiota is
depleted (either in GF or antibiotic-treated animals), the
immune response is profoundly altered.[7,81] At least some of
these immune irregularities in GF mice can be restored by
colonization with a normal microbiota[82] or with specific
probiotic strains.[83] Additionally, some probiotics have been
shown to attenuate pro-inflammatory profiles in cases of
pathogen
exposure
or
clinical
disease
states.[84,85]
This
microbial modulation of inflammation has implications for
the amygdala, which is responsive to peripheral immune
activation. For instance, systemic inflammation stimulates
cytokine production and neuronal activity in the amygdala.[86]
Further, diet-induced obesity is associated with a neuro-
inflammatory profile across a range of brain regions, including
the
amygdala,
and
it
has
been
hypothesized
that
one
mechanism
for
this
diet-induced
neuroinflammation
is
through alterations in the microbiota.[87] Overall, it is clear
that there are many routes by which the microbiota might
influence the amygdala.
4. Gut Microbiota Plays a Key Role in
Establishing and Modulating Amygdala
Function
4.1. Microbiota Modulates Amygdala-Dependent Behavior
For many of the behaviors and conditions described above as
amygdala-dependent, there is also evidence of regulation by the
microbiota (see Table 1 for a summary). These behavioral
findings gave the first indications that there may be correspon-
dence between amygdala and microbiota functioning, alluding
to the possibility that the microbiota-gut-brain axis may extend
beyond visceral perception to influence higher order brain
structures including the amygdala.

 4.1.1. Anxiety- and Depression-Like Behavior are Regulated by
Gut Microbiota
Perhaps the most consistent finding in this regard has been for
anxiety-related behaviors.[2] Diminished anxiety-like behavior has
been reported in GF mice[5,9] and GF zebrafish.[88] Interestingly,
there seems to be a divergence between behavioral and hormonal
measures of the stress response in GF mice, which exhibit
heightened corticosterone levels following exposure to a stressor
despite their low-anxiety behavioral profile.[8,10] However, in
agreement with the neuroendocrine profile, heightened anxiety-
like behavior has been observed in GF rats.[89] GF animals also
exhibit increased depressive-like behavior.[90] Additional preclini-
cal studies have shown that anxiety- and/or depression-like
behaviors are also altered by certain probiotic treatments,[62]
prebiotics,[91–93] and antibiotics.[94]
In humans, alterations in the microbiota have been observed
across a variety of amygdala-related clinical disorders, including
depression.[90] In addition, the composition of the microbiota is
associated with differences in affective responses to unpleasant
emotional images in healthy females.[95] Supporting these
correlational studies, fecal microbiota transfer of samples from
depressed individuals has been shown to alter the behavioral
profile
of
recipient
microbiota-deficient
mice
and
rats,
increasing anxiety- and depression-like behaviors.[90,96] Finally,
different
probiotic
strains
have
been
shown
to
reduce
symptoms of anxiety and depression across several studies
in clinical and healthy populations.[97,98] While there have also

 been several studies reporting no effect of probiotics on these
measures,[99] these disparate results may be explained by strain-
dependent effects or a moderating effect of symptom severity
because it has been reported that the beneficial effects are
greatest for those with the most negative symptoms at
baseline.[100]
4.1.2. Microbiota Alters Fear-Related Behavior
One key difficulty in using anxiety- and depression-related
behavioral tests or symptom scores to index amygdala dysfunc-
tion is that these factors are not specifically or exclusively
dependent on the amygdala.[24,31] A recent investigation from
our group aimed to bridge this gap by examining cued fear
conditioning, which is considered a more specific behavioral
read-out of amygdala function.[101] Using a modification of the
classical conditioning protocol, it was demonstrated for the first
time that amygdala-dependent fear memory is compromised in
GF mice.[101] That is, the GF individuals displayed impaired
short-term fear recall in adulthood as compared to convention-
ally raised adults or ex-GF adults (i.e., mice raised in a GF
environment but re-housed with conventional animals at
weaning to restore the microbiota). In this same study, a
number of differences in amygdala gene expression were also
observed in the GF animals, suggestive of baseline hyperactivity
and differential responding to the fear stimulus, which may have
contributed to these behavioral changes (discussed in detail in a
later section).
The impaired fear recall observed in GF animals has
interesting parallels to a recent study showing that administra-
tion of doxycycline during a fear conditioning procedure can
reduce later expression of fear recall in humans.[102] While the
authors investigated doxycycline due to its properties as an
inhibitor of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase 9, it is also a
broad-spectrum antibiotic. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor partial agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) is another broad-
spectrum antibiotic with fear-modulating properties. Specifi-
cally, it has been shown to enhance fear extinction in rodents and
exposure therapy in clinical anxiety disorders.[103,104] Although it
is unclear whether a microbial mechanism is at play in these
cases of acute antibiotic administration, it is certainly a
hypothesis worth considering.
It has also been shown that probiotic treatments can alter
learned fear expression. Administration of probiotic Bifidobac-
teria strains has been shown to enhance both contextual and
cued fear conditioning as well as contextual fear recall.[105] The
effects of probiotics on extinction of learned fear responses
have been more mixed in adult rodents. The Bifidobacteria
strains had no effect on fear extinction,[105] whereas a
Lactobacillus strain slowed extinction learning in adult mice
although anxiety-like behavior was reduced following treat-
ment.[62] Most recently, it has been shown that immunization
with a heat-killed bacterium (Mycobacterium vaccae) accelerates
extinction learning in adult rats.[106] In developing rats, a
probiotic formulation of two Lactobacillus strains has been
shown to protect against the effects of early-life stress on
learned fear behavior.[107,108] Specifically, maternally separated
male rats exhibit unusually persistent fear memories and
higher rates of fear relapse after extinction during infancy.
However,
this
“high-fear”
profile
can
be
prevented
by
administration of probiotics during the period of stress.[108]
The same probiotic treatment also prevented generational
transmission of the high-fear profile to the offspring of
maternally separated males.[106,107] It remains to be seen
whether these findings will translate to humans, but together
these studies suggest that the microbiota could become a
valuable
tool
in
regulating
amygdala-dependent
fear
expression.
4.1.3. Microbiota is Critical for Social Behavior
It has been hypothesized that the co-evolution of humans with
our microbiota
may have
been a driving force in our
sociability.[109] Notably, high levels of social interaction allow
greater transfer of microbial species between hosts. This creates
a mutually beneficial situation whereby the micro-organisms
have a greater chance of survival while the host is exposed to
greater
diversity
in
the
microbiota,
which
has
positive
implications for pathogen resistance and dietary metabo-
lism.[109] In line with this hypothesis, investigations of GF mice
have illustrated that the microbiota is key for normal social
interactions. Like humans, rodents are naturally social animals,
but GFrats and mice exhibit deficits in social behaviors such that
they show less interest in social interaction and poorer memory
for social partners.[89,110–112] Deficits in social behavior are
also observed following antibiotic-induced depletion of the
microbiota.[72,113]
The microbiota also plays a role in murine models of ASD,
where treatment with specific bacteria has been shown to reverse
many of the social deficits observed in these animals.[111,114] There
is some promising early evidence that this approach may translate
to clinical settings. Individuals with ASD often exhibit gastroin-
testinal problems and alterations in the microbiota.[115] Accord-
ingly, preliminary pilot studies show that probiotics may reduce
risk for ASD onset if administered perinatally[116] and reduce
symptom severity in children already diagnosed with ASD.[117] In
addition, significant improvements in gastrointestinal and
behavioral symptoms were observed in an open pilot of faecal
microbiota transplants for children with ASD.[118]
4.1.4. Microbial Signals Modulate Visceral Pain
As was the case for other key amygdala-dependent behaviors,
visceral pain perception is also regulated by the gut micro-
biota.[57] For example, microbiota depletion has been shown to
induce visceral hypersensitivity in adulthood for both GF
mice[119] and mice exposed to antibiotics early in life.[120] On the
other hand, stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity can be
reversed by treatment with either probiotics[121] or antibiot-
ics.[122] Microbiota modulation of visceral pain perception is one
reason that the microbiota has been posited to play an important
role in the etiology and maintenance of IBS.[51] Indeed, IBS is
associated with altered microbiota composition, at least in a
substantial subset of patients.[123,124] Furthermore, the micro-
biota has been causally implicated in IBS in two studies utilising

 fecal microbiota transplant.[125,126] By transferring the micro-
biota from IBS patients into healthy mice, characteristic
symptoms of IBS gastrointestinal dysfunction can be induced,
including accelerated gastrointestinal transit and increased
intestinal permeability. In addition, both probiotic and antibiotic
treatments have been shown to have positive effects on pain
symptoms in clinical studies of IBS patients.[127]
4.2. Microbiota Modulates Amygdala Structure and
Function
Building on observations that amygdala-dependent behavior is
altered by the microbiota, there are an accumulating number of
studies suggesting that the amygdala itself is sensitive to
microbiota manipulations (see Table 2 for a summary). Most
convincingly, converging evidence from GF mice indicates that
the amygdala transcriptome is hyperactive in the absence of a
microbiota.[36,37] This hyperactive state is consistent with the
altered phenotype of GF mice in regards to both social and fear-
related behaviors,[101,110] pain sensitivity,[119] as well as elevated
stress-induced HPA axis responses (see Figure 4).[8,10] More
broadly, the studies outlined below suggest that microbiota-to-
amygdala signalling may result in functionally relevant changes
in the amygdala.
4.2.1. Amygdala Morphology and Gut Microbiota
Using GF mice, it has been demonstrated that the microbiota
influences amygdala morphology.[16] It was observed that the
amygdala is enlarged in GF adult mice, reminiscent of findings
in clinical studies of children with ASD albeit that differences in
amygdala size typically resolve by adulthood in clinical samples,
and dendritic morphology in amygdala neurons is also altered.
Specifically, dendritic length was extended, the number of
branch points on interneurons was increased, and spine density
on pyramidal neurons was increased in the amygdalae of GF
mice. Although two studies failed to find a relationship between
overall microbiota composition and amygdala volume in IBS
patients and healthy women,[95,123] another identified a particu-
lar bacterial phylum that was associated with microstructure of
this region.[128] That is, abundance of Actinobacteria correlated
with increased fractional anisotropy in the amygdala. The
specificity of these findings is likely reflective of the fact that
differences in microbiota composition across human partic-
ipants are far more subtle and varied than the stark contrast to be
expected between conventionally raised and GF mice.[7]
4.2.2. Microbiota Influences Amygdala Activity and
Connectivity in Functional Brain Imaging Studies
Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
in humans suggest that the microbiota can also alter amygdala
connectivity. Preliminary data indicate that the composition of
the microbiota is associated with altered functional connectivity
between the amygdala and anterior insula in very young
children, which is also predictive of cognitive performance at
2 years of age.[129] In healthy women, it has been shown that
different microbiota profiles are associated with differences in
the patterns of structural white-matter connectivity.[95] The main
distinguishing feature was an alteration in the connectivity
between
an
emotion
regulation
network
(including
the
amygdala) and other brain regions involved in attention and
sensory perception. In a separate study by the same group,[35]
4 weeks of a probiotic treatment was sufficient to alter functional
network responses to emotional faces in healthy females. In
particular, amygdala activity was dampened during the task and
resting state connectivity of a network that included the

 amygdala was altered for the probiotic-treated participants.
Essentially, these data provide the first evidence of a clinical link
between the microbiota and functional connectivity of the
amygdala.
4.2.3. Microbial Regulation of Gene Expression in the
Amygdala
A variety of changes in mRNA and protein expression have been
observed in the amygdala of GF and antibiotic-treated animals.
These include frequently reported alterations in levels of
BDNF,[4,5,94] which has critical roles in CNS development
and neuronal plasticity and has been implicated in a range of
psychiatric disorders.[130] Further, microbiota-depletion has been
shown to alter expression of mRNA for a number of genes
related to anxiety and mood disorders, stress responses, and fear
learning and extinction, such as the glucocorticoid receptor
Nr3c1, CRH receptor 1, and the NMDA receptor NR2B.[9,94] The
probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) has also been shown to
alter GABA receptor mRNA levels in the rodent amygdala in a
vagus-dependent manner.[62] However, this particular strain did
not seem to have any effect on healthy human subjects,
highlighting the importance of conducting translational studies
in this field.[131]
Whole
genome
sequencing
studies
in GF mice
have
demonstrated that the absence of a microbiota broadly alters
the
amygdala
at
a
transcriptional
level.[36,37,101]
Multiple
complementary analyses produced converging evidence that,
under basal conditions, GF mice exhibit significant up-
regulation of genes related to synaptic plasticity, transcription,
and neuronal activity.[36] This included upregulation of the
immediate early response genes Fos, Fosb, Egr2, and Nr4a1,
while
network
analysis
of
dysregulated
genes
identified
interaction partners belonging to the cAMP responsive element
binding protein (CREB) and MAP-Kinase pathways (both of
which are heavily implicated in the regulation of neuronal
plasticity).[30,132] Similar increases in genes related to neuronal
activity, synaptic plasticity, synaptic transmission, and neuron
development were later observed in a different GF mouse
strain.[101] In both strains of mice, these changes in gene
expression were partially reversed by post-weaning colonisation
in ex-GF animals.[36,101]
The amygdala transcriptome has also been measured in GF
mice following exposure to a fear-conditioned stimulus.[101] As
expected, increased expression of the immediate early genes Fos,
Fosb, and Egr2 was observed in the conventional mice following
fear
expression,
indicating
task-related
activation
of
the
amygdala. However, the expression of these genes was similar
for naïve and fear conditioned GF animals, likely due to the
elevated levels of expression in naïve GFanimals, possibly due to
differential baseline priming of the amygdala. More recently,
further transcriptomic studies from our group, this time in
response to social interaction stimuli, have shown similar
dysregulation
of
the
amygdalar
transcriptional
response,
including a lack of social interaction-induced gene expression
for many of the genes upregulated in conventionally raised mice
(Stilling et al., unpublished observations). Taken together, these
studies reveal that the transcriptional landscape of the amygdala
is contingent on the host microbiota. Further, it appears that
elevated basal activity in GF animals may prevent appropriate
upregulation of neuronal activation in response to amygdala-
dependent tasks.
To complement the above findings, we have investigated
whether the altered transcriptional pathways in the amygdala
are also regulated by the microbiota at the post-transcriptional
level.[36,37] We found a large dysregulated network of miRNA
expression in GF mice, which may be associated with the
observed behavioral changes. Using an in silico approach, it was
noted that many of the altered transcriptional pathways in GF
mice could indeed be regulated by miRNAs. Thus, it seems likely
that microbes may influence not only transcriptional but also
post-transcriptional mechanisms in GF mice. Overall, these data
support the concept that the microbiome can have a direct role in
the regulation of behavior, particularly for amygdala-dependent
responses.
5. Conclusions and Future Perspectives
There is a growing literature to support the notion that changes
in the microbiota can not only be communicated to the amygdala
but can also induce functionally relevant alterations in this brain
region. This highlights the potential of the microbiota as a target
to produce changes in amygdala-dependent behaviors, particu-
larly in cases of amygdala dysfunction. Although preliminary in
nature, there is some promising but largely preclinical evidence
to suggest that microbiota modulation may be a useful tool in the
treatment of amygdala-related clinical disorders. These findings
warrant replication to establish the robustness of microbiota
effects on amygdala-dependent outcomes. In addition, further
research is needed to test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms
for current findings and the translational value of preclinical
research in this area.
As we delve further into the mechanisms for microbial
interactions with the brain, and more specifically with the
Figure 4. Hypothesised activation and inhibition of amgydalar circuits
can explain the behavioral and physiological profile of germ-free mice.
Specifically, hyperactivation of the lateral (LA) and basolateral (BLA)
nuclei as well as the lateral division of the central nucleus (lCeA) would
promote HPA axis and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) activation but
inhibition of the medial division of the central nucleus (mCeA). The
behavioral consequences of these functional changes include increased
pain sensitivity, increased stress responsivity, changes in anxiety, and
dampened sociability.

 amygdala, we will be able to define the conditions under which
the microbiota contributes to amygdala function. This will
require creative solutions to the problems posed by the study
of amygdala-specific behaviors in preclinical research on the
microbiota, particularly in germ-free settings. It will also be
crucial for clinical research to move beyond observational
studies in order to assess the translational value of current
findings in rodents. These goals, while challenging, are
certainly worth pursuing because the reward for such research
could be invaluable insights into the potential applications of
microbiota manipulations for the treatment of amygdala-
related disorders.
