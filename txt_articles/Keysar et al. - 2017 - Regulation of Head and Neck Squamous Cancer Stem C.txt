Abstract
Background: We have an incomplete understanding of the differences between cancer stem cells (CSCs) in human
papillomavirus–positive (HPV-positive) and –negative (HPV-negative) head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). The PI3K
pathway has the most frequent activating genetic events in HNSCC (especially HPV-positive driven), but the differential sig-
naling between CSCs and non-CSCs is also unknown.
Methods: We addressed these unresolved questions using CSCs identified from 10 HNSCC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).
Sorted populations were serially passaged in nude mice to evaluate tumorigenicity and tumor recapitulation. The transcrip-
tion profile of HNSCC CSCs was characterized by mRNA sequencing, and the susceptibility of CSCs to therapy was investi-
gated using an in vivo model. SOX2 transcriptional activity was used to follow the asymmetric division of PDX-derived CSCs.
All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: CSCs were enriched by high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and CD44 expression and were similar between
HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases (percent tumor formation injecting � 1x103 cells: ALDHþCD44high ¼ 65.8%,
ALDH-CD44high ¼ 33.1%, ALDHþCD44high ¼ 20.0%; and injecting 1x105 cells: ALDH-CD44low ¼ 4.4%). CSCs were resistant to con-
ventional therapy and had PI3K/mTOR pathway overexpression (GSEA pathway enrichment, P < .001), and PI3K inhibition
in vivo decreased their tumorigenicity (40.0%–100.0% across cases). PI3K/mTOR directly regulated SOX2 protein levels, and
SOX2 in turn activated ALDH1A1 (P < .001 013C and 067C) expression and ALDH activity (ALDHþ [%] empty-control vs SOX2,
0.4% 6 0.4% vs 14.5% 6 9.8%, P ¼ .03 for 013C and 1.7% 6 1.3% vs 3.6% 6 3.4%, P ¼ .04 for 067C) in 013C and 067 cells. SOX2 en-
hanced sphere and tumor growth (spheres/well, 013C P < .001 and 067C P ¼ .04) and therapy resistance. SOX2 expression
prompted mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) by inducing CDH1 (013C P ¼ .002, 067C P ¼ .01), followed by asymmetric
division and proliferation, which contributed to tumor formation.

 Conclusions: The molecular link between PI3K activation and CSC properties found in this study provides insights into therapeutic
strategies for HNSCC. Constitutive expression of SOX2 in HNSCC cells generates a CSC-like population that enables CSC studies.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) incidence is
increasing in the United States, mostly because of a rise in hu-
man
papillomavirus
(HPV)–positive
oropharyngeal
HNSCCs
(45 780 vs 29 370 new cases in 2015 vs 2005) (1–4). Cancer stem
cells (CSCs) maintain an undifferentiated phenotype, are resis-
tant to therapy (5), and repopulate tumor heterogeneity upon
recurrence or metastasis (6). These characteristics make CSCs
an attractive yet challenging therapeutic target (7). CSCs of HPV-
negative HNSCC are most consistently defined by aldehyde de-
hydrogenase (ALDH) activity (8) or CD44 expression (9), but prior
investigations have relied heavily on in vitro studies or single
markers to define CSC populations (10).
Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling is commonly
activated in HNSCC by PIK3CA amplification or mutation (11–
13); however, antitumor responses to PI3K inhibition can oc-
cur with or without these activating genetic events (14–16).
PI3K signaling promotes tumor cell proliferation and survival
(17) and is overexpressed in CSCs across different cancers
(18,19). PIK3CA oncogenic alterations occur more frequently in
HPV-positive compared with HPV-negative HNSCC (56% vs
34%, respectively) (20). The following unanswered questions
may explain the differential clinical behavior of these HNSCC
subtypes:
1)
What
markers
define
CSCs
in
HPV-positive
HNSCC? 2) What are the differences or similarities in signal-
ing pathways between HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC
CSCs?
Using HPV-negative and HPV-positive patient-derived xe-
nografts
(PDXs),
we
defined
a
consistent
population
of
ALDHþCD44high CSCs across HNSCC subtypes. We characterized
the core transcriptional profile of CSCs and their susceptibility
to anticancer agents, showing that CSCs (HPV-positive and
HPV-negative) are resistant to standard therapy but are particu-
larly susceptible to PI3K inhibition. We report how PI3K and
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling through the
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF4E) specifically
upregulated the sex determining region Y box 2 (SOX2), a tran-
scription factor linked to stemness in squamous cancers (21,22).
SOX2 in turn increased the ALDHþ cell population by direct
upregulation of ALDH1A1 and enhanced spheroid and tumor
formation. This is the first report using a large panel of HNSCC
PDX samples to elucidate how CSCs harness deregulated PI3K
signaling to orchestrate sustained tumor growth.
Methods
PDX Generation
The protocol for studies involving human subjects was ap-
proved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board
(COMIRB #08-0552), and informed written consent was obtained
from all patients whose tissues were used for this study. The
University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee approved all experiments involving mice. PDX gen-
eration and characterization was previously reported (14).
Briefly, tumor pieces were implanted on both flanks of five six-
to 10-week-old female Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu mice (Envigo,
Denver, CO). Patient cases (F4-F8 generation) were expanded
into cohorts of 10 to 20 mice for CSC isolation.
CSC Implantation In Vivo
CSCs were sorted into PBS þ2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), suspended
in 1:1, DMEM þ10% FBS:Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY) to 100 mL
per injection, and injected (25 g needle) into the flanks of nude
mice. Mice were monitored for tumor growth for up to one year.
SOX2/OCT4 Response Elements (SORE6) Reporter
The SORE6 assay was previously described (23) and consists of
six SOX2/OCT4 response elements in front a minimal mCMVp
promoter driving the expression of destabilized forms of GFP or
mCherry. Lentiviral media containing the mCMVp-GFP (control),
mCMVp-mCherry
(control),
SORE6-mCMVp-GFP,
or
SORE6-
mCMV-mCherry reporters were generated using HEK293T cells
and the pCMV-SSV-G and pHR-8.2DR packaging plasmids. Cell
lines or PDX-derived CSCs were cultured in media containing vi-
rus for 24 hours. Cells containing the SORE6 reporter were se-
lected using puromycin (1 mg/mL) for 7 days. Expression of GFP
or mCherry was observed by fluorescence microscopy and flow
cytometry (gating set at > 99.9% of control cells).
Time-Lapse Microscopy of Tumor-Derived CSCs
SORE6þ CSCs were seeded in chamber slides on a Matrigel layer
overlaid with media þ2% Matrigel, and imaged every 20 minutes
using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope (Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) (Zeiss software Rel. 4.8) in a climate
chamber.
Statistical Analysis
In vitro and in vivo (using �5 mice/group) experiments were
compared with a two-group t test. Calculations were done using
GraphPad Prism version 7.0 and SPSS version 11. Data are repre-
sented graphically as mean 6 SD. GSEA estimates the statistical
significance of the enrichment scores by a two-sided modified
Kolmogorov-Smirnov permutation test. P values of less than .05
were statistically significant. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results
Tumorigenicity of Tumor Populations Defined by ALDH
Activity and CD44 Expression
To identify common or distinct CSC populations across subtypes,
we studied tumorigenicity in 10 (6 HPV-negative, 4 HPV-positive)
HNSCC PDX cases (Supplementary Table 1, available online). Cells
were sorted by CD44 expression and Aldefluor activity and im-
planted on nude mice. The CD44high population was typically
larger than the ALDHþ fraction, while the ALDHþCD44high popula-
tion ranged from 0.1% to 4.1% of tumor cells (Figure 1, A and B).
Despite

population
heterogeneity
across
cases,
ALDHþCD44high defined the most tumorigenic population in nine
of the 10 cases; CUHN022 did not express detectable CD44, thus
ALDH activity alone defined the tumorigenic (CSC-enriched)
population in this particular tumor. Average tumor formation

 rate (across 10 cases) was 65.8% when 1000 or fewer CSCs
(ALDHþCD44high) were implanted, vs 33.1% and 20.0% with 1000 or
fewer ALDH-CD44high and ALDHþCD44low cells, and 4.4% when im-
planting 100 000 negative cells (Table 1). ALDHþCD44high cells met
the tumor-initiating criteria of CSCs in both HPV-positive and
HPV-negative HNSCCs.
Morphological and Molecular Marker Comparison of
Originating and CSC-Initiated Tumors
We examined morphology, epidermal growth factor (EGFR) ex-
pression, and transcriptome profiles over sequential CSC im-
plantations. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that
morphology of CSC-derived tumors was comparable with the
originating tumor; EGFR membrane staining was consistent be-
tween patient tissue, PDX tumors, and CSC-initiated tumors
(Figure 1C). Single positive cell (defined as ALDHþCD44low or
ALDH-CD44high) implantations generated tumors with less dif-
ferentiated squamous morphology than CSC-originated tumors
(Supplementary Figure 1A, available online).
Tumors from CSCs, compared with single positive cells, had
the most similar mRNA-seq profiles when compared with the
original patient tumor (Figure 1D). To assess tumorigenic stabil-
ity, we sorted and implanted CSCs from the first passage of
CSC-derived tumors and found that tumor take and growth
rates were consistent with the first implantation (Table 1;
Supplementary Figure 1B, available online). Second passage
CSC-derived tumors were also most similar to the original pa-
tient tumor (Figure 1, C and D).

CSCs

ond/serial CSC implantation consistently cluster with the originating PDX tumor (clustering generated with FPKM values > 1). Tumors arising from CUHN004 and
CUHN013 non-CSCs (ALDH-CD44high) were more distantly associated with the original PDX tumor. ALDH ¼ aldehyde dehydrogenase; CSC ¼ cancer stem cell; FPKM ¼
fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped; HNSCC ¼ head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; HPV-neg. ¼ human papilloma virus–negative; HPV-
pos. ¼ human papilloma virus–positive; PDX ¼ patient-derived xenograft.

 positive (CUHN014, CUHN022) tumors. (Supplementary Figure
1C, available online). CUHN004 and CUHN022 were PIK3CA wild-
type, and CUHN013 and CUHN014 had high-level PIK3CA copy
gain. We observed statistically significant enrichment of signal-
ing networks crucial in stem cell and CSC biology across HPV-
positive and HPV-negative CSCs, including packaging of telo-
mere ends (P < .001), PI3K/mTOR pathway (P < .001), E-cadherin
signaling (P < .001), genes regulated by MYC (P < .001), signaling
by wingless-related integration site (WNT; P < .001), and signal-
ing by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b; P < .001) (Figure
2A; Supplementary Table 2, available online). HPV-negative
CSCs had lower p53 signaling compared with HPV-positive CSCs
(P < .001), consistent with their respective TP53 mutant and
wild-type status (Supplementary Table 3, available online).
Upregulation of stemness-related genes in CSCs including
SOX21 (P ¼ .005), a mediator of SOX2 gene regulation (24), and
ALDH1A1 (P ¼ .003), a marker of CSCs (8,25), were statistically
significant across HPV subtypes. SOX2 and ALDH1A1 protein
levels were dramatically higher in CSCs (Figure 2B), and
ALDH1A1 was associated with cells expressing SOX2 in patient
tumors (Figure 2C).
SOX2-high cells have increased levels of both p4EBP1 and
pS6K (effectors of PI3K/mTOR) when compared with SOX2-low
cells (Figure 2C), especially in areas near vessels and stroma.
E-cadherin showed consistent mRNA and protein enrichment
in CSCs, as well as in vivo costaining distribution with SOX2
(Figure 2, A–C), suggesting a more epithelial phenotype.
Response of CSCs to a Panel of Therapies Using an In
Vivo Re-implantation Assay
To assess CSC response to therapy in vivo, we treated CUHN013
(HPV-negative),
CUHN014
(HPV-positive),
and
CUHN022
(HPV-positive) tumor-bearing mice with vehicle, radiation ther-
apy
(XRT),
docetaxel,
cetuximab,
and
the
PI3K
inhibitors
ZSTK474 and PX-866. Tumors were then resected, sorted, and the
resulting cell populations (see Table 1) were implanted in mice
(Figure 3A). CSCs generated more tumors in control and treat-
ment
groups
compared
with
non-CSC
populations
(Supplementary Table 4, available online), confirming that CSCs
are more tumorigenic, with or without treatment, which impacts
mouse survival (Supplementary Figure 1D, available online).
XRT decreased tumorigenicity in CUHN014 (100.0% control
vs 20.0% XRT) and CUHN022 (60.0% control vs 0.0% XRT), but not
CUHN013 (100.0% control vs 80.0% XRT) (Figure 3A). Both PI3K
inhibitors delayed and/or blocked tumor formation by CSCs in
all cases (control vs PX-866, ZSTK, 100.0% vs 0.0%, 40.0% for
CUHN014; 60.0% vs 0.0%, 0.0% for CUHN022; 100.0% vs 60.0%,
20.0% for CUN013), whereas cetuximab and docetaxel had

Figure 1E, available online). In summary, CSC tumorigenicity
was
associated
with
resistance
to

therapy,
whereas CSCs showed susceptibility to PI3K inhibition across
etiologic subtypes.
Effects of PI3K Inhibition on SOX2 and the ALDHþ
Population
We generated early-passage cell lines (referred to as 013C, 036C,
and 067C) that form tumors similar to the original tumor histo-
logically (Supplementary Figure 2A, available online) and molec-
ularly
(Figure
1D),
suggesting
conservation
of
CSC-like
populations and properties. Compared with monolayer culture,
cells grown in CSC-enriching sphere culture had higher expres-
sion of ALDH1A1 (fold change 6 SD, 51.7 6 5.4, P ¼ .004 for 013C,
and 39.8 6 1.9, P < .001 for 067C), SOX2 mRNA (fold change 6 SD,
3.5 6 0.3, P ¼ .002 for 013C, and 3.6 6 0.5, P ¼ .009 for 067C)
(Figure 3, B and C), increased ALDH1A1 and SOX2 protein levels
(Figure 3D), and increased ALDHþ cell populations (monolayer
vs sphere, 1.4% 6 0.7 vs 23.9% 6 4.6, P ¼ .009 for 013C, and 3.0%
6 1.3 vs 21.0% 6 4.5, P ¼ .02 for 067C) (Figure 3E). PI3K inhibition
(ZSTK474) decreased the ALDHþ population in both sphere

1.6% 6 1.7, P ¼ .008 for 067C) and monolayer cultures (Figure 4, A
and B). ZSTK474 decreased ALDH1A1 expression in both cell line

and 0.13 6 0.04, P ¼ .009 for 013C; 0.66 6 0.05, P ¼ .001, and 0.13 6
0.02, P < .001 for 067C) (Figure 4C) and cell line monolayer
(Supplementary Figure 2B, available online), as well as tumor-
derived CSC sphere cultures of tumor-derived CSCs (1 mM and

P ¼ .002) (Figure 4D). SOX2 and ALDH1A1 protein levels de-
creased with ZSTK474 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4E;
Supplementary Figure 2C, available online). Targeting EGFR di-
rectly or its downstream signaling with a MEK/ERK inhibitor did
not suppress ALDH1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2D,

These

establish
that
PI3K
inhibition
suppresses both SOX2 and ALDH activity within the same
population.
SOX2 protein levels decrease following PI3K/mTOR inhibi-
tion in cancer cells (19,26), but the mechanism was not defined.
We knocked down AKT1 (downstream of PI3K), and S6K and
EIF4E (both downstream of TORC1) (Supplementary Figure 2H,
available online). SOX2 levels decreased after silencing AKT1
(siAKT#1 P < .001, siAKT#2 P ¼ .08 for 0.13C and siAKT#1 P ¼ .008,
siAKT#2 P ¼ .10 for 067C) or EIF4E (siEIF4E#1 P ¼ .06, siEIF4E#2
P ¼ .005 for 013C and siEIF4E#1 P ¼ .36, siEIF4E#2 P ¼ .02 for 067C)
(Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure 2I, available online). EIF4E
regulates protein levels through both mRNA capping and ini-
tiation of translation downstream of mTOR signaling, which
is negatively regulated by hypo-phosphorylated 4EBP1 (27).
4EGI-1 inhibited the interaction of EIF4E and EIF4G and de-
creased SOX2 levels and the ALDHþ fraction in HNSCC cells
(Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure 3A, available online); ZSTK474
decreased levels of phosphorylated (Ser65) 4EBP1 in 013C cells

 inactivation of EIF4E. We then performed RNA immunoprecipi-
tation (RIP) and found that EIF4E physically bound SOX2 mRNA
(Figure 5C), suggesting mRNA capping of SOX2 mRNA regulates
translation. More SOX2 mRNA was bound by EIF4E when cells
exogenously
expressed
more
SOX2
mRNA
(Supplementary
Figure 3C, available online), though the same amount of EIF4E
was immunoprecipitated (Figure 5C). Taken together, PI3K/
mTOR signaling regulates EIF4E capping of SOX2 mRNA and
translation of SOX2.
Role of SOX2 in the Maintenance of the ALDHþ
Population
Retroviral-mediated
expression
of
SOX2
increased
ALDH1A1
mRNA (Supplementary Figure 3D, available online) and protein
levels (Figure 5D; Supplementary Figure 3E, available online).
ALDH1A1 upregulation occurred rapidly (<6 days) and led to a
larger ALDHþ population (empty vs SOX2, 0.4% 6 0.4 vs 14.5% 6 9.
8, P ¼ .03 for 013C, and 1.7% 6 1.3 vs 3.6% 6 3.4, P¼ .04 for 067C)
(Figure 5, E and F). PI3K inhibition or SOX2 expression had no ef-
fect on CD44 surface protein levels (Supplementary Figure 3F,
available online). SOX2 knockdown suppressed ALDH1A1 tran-
scripts (P< .001), protein levels, and the ALDHþ population (P< .
001) (Figure 5, G–I) in 013C cells. Finally, retroviral-mediated SOX2
expression activated the ALDH1A1 promoter as measured by lucif-
erase activity (P ¼ .002) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
using SOX2 antibodies, showing that SOX2 bound to the ALDH1A1
promoter (Figure 5J). These data confirm that SOX2 controls
ALDH1A1 levels by direct regulation of the ALDH1A1 promoter,
and ALDH1A1 is responsible for the ALDHþ population in HNSCCs.
Role of SOX2 in the Regulation of the CSC Phenotype
An unsupervised whole transcriptome comparison between
control-vector and SOX2-overexpressing cells found that SOX2
expression increased stem cell, cell-to-cell, and growth factor–
signaling pathways (013C), and genes key to CSCs like ALDH1A1,
SOX2, and CXCR4 (013C, 067C) (Figure 6, A and B). These data are
consistent with the signaling pattern associated with HNSCC

like signaling.
SOX2 expression suppressed the pro-EMT factor SNAI1 (013C
P ¼ .002, 036C P ¼ .01, 067C P ¼ .09) and increased expression of
CDH1 (E-cadherin; 013C P ¼ .002, 036C P ¼ .002, 067C P ¼ .01), gen-
erating an epithelial phenotype (Figure 6, C–G). E-cadherin was
associated with high SOX2 expression at the outer growing edge
of tumor spheres (Figure 6H), and retroviral-mediated SOX2
expression decreased invasiveness of HNSCC cells (invading
cells/view empty vector vs SOX2, 90.0 6 33.5 vs 1.4 6 0.7, P ¼ .01

vs 28.1 6 9.6, P < .001 for 067C) (Figure 6I). TGF-b signaling was
enriched in CSCs (Figure 2A), but cell lines or tumor-derived
CSCs treated with TGF-b inhibition (LY2109761 for 48 hours) did
not have altered expression of SNAI1 or CDH1, even when phos-
phorylation of Smad3 was inhibited (Supplementary Figure 4,
A–C, available online). However, treating these cells with extra
TGF-b1 (10 ng/mL for 24 h) increased SNAI1 expression that was
blocked by LY2109761 (Supplementary Figure 4C, available
online). Neither TGF-b1 nor LY2109761 affected HNSCC cell in-
vasion (Supplementary Figure 4D, available online). Together,
these results suggest that SOX2 overcomes endogenous TGF-b
effects on EMT, growth inhibition, and invasion and thus has
a dominant effect on maintaining an epithelial phenotype
(Figure 2, A–C) (28).
Transitions in cellular morphology are associated with
changes in sensitivity to therapy (29), and we found that SOX2
expression
decreased
sensitivity
to
docetaxel

Sphere formation (spheres/well, 013C P < .001 and 067C P ¼ .04)
and sphere size (average sphere diameter, 013C P ¼ .02 and 067C
P ¼ .02) were also enhanced by SOX2 expression (Figure 7B).
CUHN013 PDX CSCs readily form spheres compared with non-
CSC cells (Supplementary Figure 4E, available online), and SOX2
knockdown decreases sphere formation (P ¼ .002) (Figure 7C).
SOX2-expressing 013C cells increased tumor initiation and

 an epithelial phenotype, enables characteristics of CSCs, and in-
creases the ALDHþ (CSC-like) population in HNSCC, adding to
the armamentarium to study CSC biology (30).
SOX2 Transcriptional Activity in Daughter Cells of
Single Tumor–Derived CSCs
We demonstrated that CSCs can recapitulate the originating tu-
mor in vivo, giving rise to a heterogeneous cell population.
We then examined asymmetric division assessing changes
in SOX2 activity in vitro using an anchorage-independent,
three-dimensional matrigel assay where CSCs formed spheres
(Figure 7F). SORE6þ tumor-derived CSCs were individually
seeded on a matrigel layer, and single cells were followed using
time-lapse microscopy (120 hours). Single SORE6þ CSCs gave
rise to multiple SORE6- daughter cells while maintaining fluo-
rescence in others (Figure 7G), suggesting that daughter cells
have different levels of SOX2 activity and likely diversified prop-
erties. Therefore, SOX2 activity may be used to detect and quan-
tify asymmetric division, which is an early event in sphere/
tumor initiation leading to tumor repopulation.
Discussion
CSCs are small tumor cell populations that perpetuate growth
and recapitulate tumor heterogeneity by asymmetric division,
are resistant to therapy, and enable phenotypic flexibility lead-
ing to invasion and metastasis (6). PDX models enable studying
relevant cancer subtypes that have been underrepresented in
conventional cell line panels like HPV-positive HNSCC. ALDH
activity and CD44 expression defined CSCs regardless of HPV
status. CSCs serially passaged over several generations faith-
fully recapitulated the histology and expression profiles ob-
served in the originating tumor. Together, ALDH activity and

 CD44 expression are the primary markers for CSCs in HNSCC
regardless of etiology.
Despite clinical and etiologic heterogeneity in our cohort, the
transcriptome analysis of CSCs vs non-CSCs identified common
signaling themes across subtypes (most importantly, HPV-
negative and HPV-positive), including enrichment of stem cell
maintenance pathways (telomere maintenance, Wnt, HIF1a, and
MYC), PI3K/mTOR signaling, and TGF-b/SMAD. Lower p53 signal-
ing in HPV-negative (vs HPV-positive) CSCs was expected as
HPV-negative HNSCC tumors harbor inactivating TP53 mu-
tations, making them more resistant to XRT (31). The use of core
signaling pathways to drive oncogenesis has profound transla-
tional implications as it indicates common therapeutic avenues
across HNSCC clinical subtypes and other cancer types (18,32,33).
CSCs were less susceptible to conventional therapies com-
pared with non-CSCs. Because tumor-stroma interactions can
dictate the efficacy of XRT and cytotoxic agents (34), we used
in vivo treatment to model CSC behavior after therapy. PI3K
inhibition and XRT targeted CSCs preferentially, compared
with docetaxel or cetuximab, blocking tumor regrowth regard-
less of PIK3CA (or HPV) status. These findings support inhibit-
ing PI3K signaling in combination with XRT to target HNSCC
CSCs.
We identified a link between PI3K/mTOR signaling (the most
commonly activating genetic event in HNSCC) and the regulation
of key CSC genes. One of the primary properties of CSCs, ALDH ac-
tivity, was regulated by PI3K signaling and SOX2. Retroviral-
mediated SOX2 expression dramatically increased ALDH1A1 and
the ALDHþ
cell population by interacting directly with the
ALDH1A1 promoter. SOX2 expression regulated other key CSC fea-
tures in HNSCC, including sphere and tumor formation and drug
resistance (Figure 7H). Constitutive expression of SOX2 in HNSCC
cells generates a CSC-like population that enables CSC studies.
HNSCC CSCs have an epithelial phenotype by immunohisto-
chemistry and have high E-cadherin mRNA and protein expres-
sion, which are distinct from descriptions of CSCs in other

 tumor types (33,35). Modeling of CSC by constitutive SOX2 ex-
pression unequivocally promoted an epithelial morphology in
HNSCC cells by increasing E-cadherin and decreasing SNAIL.
E-cadherin can be used as an alternative to OCT4 for the genera-
tion of iPSCs (36) and induces pluripotent stem cells (37), sup-
porting
the
relevance
of
E-cadherin
in
CSCs.
SCC
CSCs
transition between epithelial and mesenchymal states because
of environmental stressors (38) and when metastasizing are
able to gain a more mesenchymal phenotype without loss of
E-cadherin (39). Recent reports have shown that metastasis can
occur without EMT (40,41), and the data presented here estab-
lish that HNSCC CSCs derived from patient tissue have an epi-
thelial phenotype.
SORE6þ CSCs are capable of asymmetric division, fulfilling
another hallmark of CSCs (6). Using a 3D matrix model, we were
able to track the asymmetric division of a single HNSCC CSC
by the real-time binding of response elements by SOX2 (23).
Individual SORE6þ HNSCC CSCs generated both positive and
diminished/negative daughter cells while initiating tumor
sphere formation, suggesting the SORE6þ daughter cells are
the remaining CSC population, while the SORE6- (with low
SOX2 activity) cells are likely a more differentiated lineage
population. This supports that CSCs can recapitulate the het-
erogeneity of the original tumor via their ability to asymmetrically
divide. To our knowledge, this is the first report tracking the
asymmetric division of CSCs derived directly from patient tumors.
Our studies linking PI3K signaling with CSCs properties are
not without limitations. A recent report demonstrates the dy-
namic ability of squamous tumor cells to reactivate PI3K/mTOR
through EGFR/AXL/PKC following pharmacological inhibition of
PI3Ka (42). Similarly, resistance to PI3K inhibition in human epi-
dermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2–positive breast cancer oc-
curs following rapid activation of HER3 (43), suggesting that
multitargeted therapy may be required (44). Finally, we need to
validate our results prospectively by correlating CSC profiles
and outcomes in HNSCC.
We have characterized the molecular features and functional
properties of HNSCC CSCs derived from PDXs representing tu-
mors of both HPV and tobacco etiologies. PI3K signaling en-
hanced SOX2 translation, which in turn induced the expression
of genes regulating the stemness characteristics of CSCs. These
data support targeting PI3K therapeutically in HNSCC. Our find-
ings have elucidated a mechanistic relationship linking the most
common core genetic alterations in HNSCC with fundamental
CSC features, thus identifying promising therapeutic avenues.
