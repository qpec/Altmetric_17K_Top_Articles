Abstract  
31 
Background: Severe and uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy have been linked to several 
32 
unfavorable perinatal outcomes. However, current knowledge on the association between the severity 
33 
and control of maternal asthma and offspring asthma is sparse.  
34 
 
35 
Objective: To investigate the extent to which offspring asthma is influenced by maternal asthma 
36 
severity and control during pregnancy. 
37 
 
38 
Methods: A prospective population-based cohort study. By linkage of Danish national registers, we 
39 
constructed a cohort of 675,379 singletons, of which 15,014 children were born to asthmatic mothers. 
40 
Among them, 7,188 children were born to mothers with active asthma during pregnancy. We 
41 
categorized mothers with active asthma into four groups based on dispensed antiasthmatic prescriptions 
42 
and on use of medical services: mild controlled, mild uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe controlled, and 
43 
moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma. The outcomes were offspring early-onset transient, early-
44 
onset persistent, and late-onset asthma. We estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) of each phenotype of 
45 
asthma using a log-binomial model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  
46 
 
47 
Results: Higher prevalence of early-onset persistent asthma was observed among children of asthmatic 
48 
mothers with mild uncontrolled (PR=1.19, 95% CI:1.05–1.35), moderate-to-severe controlled 
49 
(PR=1.33, 95% CI:1.09–1.63), and moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma (PR=1.37, 95% CI:1.17–
50 
1.61), compared to those of mild controlled asthmatic mothers. A borderline increased prevalence of 
51 
early-onset transient asthma was observed among children of mothers with uncontrolled asthma. 
52 
 4 
 
Conclusion: Maternal uncontrolled asthma increases the risk of early-onset persistent and transient 
53 
asthma. If replicated, this could suggest that maintaining asthma control in pregnancy is an area for 
54 
possible prevention of specific phenotypes of offspring asthma. 
55 
 
56 
Clinical implications: In-utero exposure to uncontrolled asthma increases early-onset persistent and 
57 
transient asthma risk. This may suggest that maintaining asthma control during pregnancy is an area for 
58 
possible prevention of offspring asthma.

Introduction  
72 
Asthma is the most common chronic disease complicating pregnancy, affecting 3–9% of all 
73 
pregnancies.1-3 International guidelines recommend that asthma during pregnancy should be managed 
74 
in the same manner as for non-pregnant women to maintain asthma control.4 Nevertheless, a survey 
75 
revealed that approximately 29% of asthmatic women would discontinue asthma medication during 
76 
pregnancy, mainly for fear of adverse impacts on the fetus,5 despite accumulating evidence of the 
77 
safety of inhaled corticosteroid and β2-agonist use during pregnancy.4, 6 Correspondingly, about one-
78 
third of the women experienced uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy.7  
79 
 
80 
Poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy may deprive the fetus of oxygen, and thus affects fetal 
81 
development negatively.8 Studies have linked uncontrolled asthma to preterm birth, low birth weight, 
82 
and fetal growth restriction,9-11 which are known risk factors for asthma.12 It is, thereby, likely that 
83 
uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy may carry additional risks for offspring asthma along with 
84 
conferring a genetic risk. At present, only one study has focused on the severity and control of asthma 
85 
during pregnancy and offspring asthma risk, showing a higher risk of asthma among children of 
86 
mothers with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma than those of mothers with mild controlled 
87 
asthma.13 However, this study was underpowered to provide precise estimates for the influence of 
88 
maternal moderate-to-severe controlled asthma. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly evident that 
89 
asthma is not a single disorder but a syndrome encompassing several phenotypes, which may have 
90 
distinct pathogeneses,14 and be associated with risk factors differently.15, 16 For instance, early-onset 
91 
persistent asthma is more strongly affected by early-life environmental exposure than other phenotypes 
92 
of asthma.15, 16  
93 
 7 
 
In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association between asthma severity and control 
94 
during pregnancy and the risk of three phenotypes of asthma in the offspring. We hypothesized that 
95 
children of mothers with uncontrolled asthma had higher risks of asthma, in particular, early-onset 
96 
persistent asthma, compared to those of mothers with mild controlled asthma.  
97 
 
98 
Methods 
99 
Study population 
100 
The study was a population-based cohort study built on Danish national registers. All liveborn and new 
101 
residents in Denmark are assigned a unique 10-digit identifier recorded in the Danish Civil Registration 
102 
System.17 The identifier enables us to link individual-level data between and within all national 
103 
registers. We first identified 694,770 liveborn singletons during 1996‒2006 from the Danish Medical 
104 
Birth Registry.18 We excluded 4,372 children with missing or likely errors in gestational age (< 154 
105 
or > 315 days). As our outcomes of interest were measured according to asthma treatment at age 0–3 
106 
years and 4–6 years, to ensure all children were followed until age 6 years, we further excluded 11,643 
107 
children who emigrated, and 3,376 children who died before their 6th birthday (Figure 1). Altogether 
108 
675,379 singletons were included in our analyses. 
109 
 
110 
Maternal asthma history before delivery. We defined maternal asthma as at least one inpatient, 
111 
outpatient or emergency room visit for asthma before delivery from the Danish National Patient 
112 
Register.19 The register contains data on inpatient contacts since 1977, and from 1995 also emergency 
113 
room and outpatient treatments. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 8th Revision (ICD-
114 
8) codes was used during 1977–1993 and ICD-10 codes from 1994 and onwards. Information on 
115 
 8 
 
maternal asthma was identified based on ICD-8 code 493 and ICD-10 codes J45 or J46. We similarly 
116 
defined paternal asthma history.  
117 
 
118 
Active asthma during pregnancy. Asthmatic mothers were categorized as having active asthma if they 
119 
redeemed at least one antiasthmatic prescription or had one or more inpatient, outpatient or emergency 
120 
room visit for asthma during the index pregnancy. Pregnancy was counted from the first day of the last 
121 
menstrual period until delivery. Information on antiasthmatic prescription was obtained from the 
122 
Danish National Prescription Registry,20 which covers all prescriptions dispensed in Denmark since 
123 
1995. It contains the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification codes, the number of 
124 
defined daily dose per package, the number of packages dispensed, and the dispensation date. The 
125 
ATC codes for antiasthmatics were for inhaled β2-agonists (R03AC02–04, -12, and -13), inhaled 
126 
glucocorticoids (R03BA01, -02, and -05), fixed-dose combination of inhaled β2-agonists and 
127 
glucocorticoids (R03AK06 and -07), leukotriene receptor antagonists (R03DC03), and anti-IgE 
128 
treatment (R03DX05).  
129 
 
130 
Asthma severity and control during pregnancy. Information on the severity and control of active 
131 
asthma during pregnancy was obtained from the Danish National Prescription Registry and the Danish 
132 
National Patient Register.19, 20 We defined asthma severity and control on the basis of the doses of 
133 
inhaled corticosteroids (in beclomethasone-chlorofluorocarbon equivalent), add-on therapy 
134 
(theophylline, long-acting β2-agonists and leukotriene-receptor antagonists), short-acting β2-agonists 
135 
doses per week, and moderate-to-severe exacerbation (defined as inpatient treatment, emergency room 
136 
visit for asthma or a filled prescription of an oral corticosteroid).21 The following ATC codes were 
137 
used: theophylline (R03DA04), long-term acting β2-agonists (R03AC12 and R03AC13), short-acting 
138 
 9 
 
β2-agonists (R03AC02–04), and oral corticosteroid (H02AB). The number of days exposed per 
139 
prescription of a specific drug was calculated by multiplying the number of defined daily doses per 
140 
package by the number of packages dispensed. The number of days exposed to a specific drug was 
141 
calculated by adding all prescriptions’ durations. The equivalence of the average daily dosage of 
142 
inhaled corticosteroids into beclomethasone-chlorofluorocarbon was calculated according to the 
143 
equivalency Table generated by the Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines.22 We created four 
144 
mutually exclusive groups according to the various combinations of maternal asthma severity and 
145 
control as described below: 1) mild controlled, 2) mild uncontrolled, 3) moderate-to-severe controlled, 
146 
and 4) moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma (Table E1 in the supplement). The definition of asthma 
147 
severity and control have been described in detail elsewhere.21 
148 
 
149 
Asthma severity. We defined mild asthma as treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids doses of 251–
150 
500µg/day with no add-on therapy or inhaled glucocorticoids doses of 0–250µg/day regardless add-on 
151 
therapy. To be categorized as mild asthma, the following situations were not included: 1) moderate-to-
152 
severe exacerbations and 4–10 doses of short-acting β2-agonists per week; 2) >10 doses of short-acting 
153 
β2-agonists per week. We defined moderate-to-severe asthma as treatment with inhaled 
154 
glucocorticoids doses of 251–500µg/day with add-on therapy or inhaled glucocorticoids doses 
155 
of >500µg/day.  
156 
 
157 
Asthma control. Asthmatic mothers were considered as having controlled asthma if they had no 
158 
moderate-to-severe exacerbations and were taking 0–3 doses of short-acting β2-agonists per week for 
159 
mild asthma and ≤10 doses of short-acting β2-agonists per week for moderate-to-severe asthma. 
160 
Moreover, a woman was considered to have moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma if she had one of 
161 
 10 
 
the following situations: 1) moderate-to-severe exacerbations and 4–10 doses of short-acting β2-
162 
agonists per week; or 2)>10 doses of short-acting β2-agonists per week.  
163 
 
164 
Childhood asthma in the offspring—outcomes of interest 
165 
Our outcomes of interest were three mutually exclusive phenotypes of asthma in the offspring 
166 
according to asthma treatment (i.e. hospital or antiasthmatic treatment) during 0–3 years of age and 
167 
during 4–6 years based on the schema from Martinez et al.14.  
168 
1) Early-onset transient asthma: asthma treatment during 0–3 years but no treatment during 4–6 years;  
169 
2) Early-onset persistent asthma: asthma treatment both during 0–3 years and during 4–6 years;  
170 
3) Late-onset asthma: no asthma treatment during 0–3 years but with treatment during 4–6 years.  
171 
 
172 
Asthma hospital treatment was defined as having an inpatient, outpatient or emergency room visit for 
173 
asthma (ICD-10 codes J45 and J46), retrieved from the Danish National Patient Register. Antiasthmatic 
174 
treatment was defined as two or more dispensed prescriptions of an antiasthmatic mentioned above 
175 
within one year by using the Danish National Prescription Registry. We defined asthma treatment 
176 
during age 0–3 years as at least two prescriptions of an antiasthmatic within one year or at least one 
177 
hospital treatment for asthma during 0–3 years. We similarly defined asthma treatment during age 4–6 
178 
years. 
179 
 
180 
Statistical analysis 
181 
Statistical analyses were done using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We calculated the 
182 
prevalence of each phenotype of asthma‒early-onset transient, early-onset persistent, and late-onset 
183 
asthma, respectively. Since asthma is not a rare outcome, we estimated the prevalence ratio (PR) of 
184 
 11 
 
each phenotype of asthma and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a log-binomial model.23 The 
185 
log-binomial method was performed with PROC GENMOD using the binomial distribution and the log 
186 
link. We specified an initial value of -4 for the intercept. A woman may contribute more than one 
187 
pregnancy to the analysis. To account for the dependence between siblings, we used robust sandwich 
188 
variance estimator for correction of standard errors. A P-value of <0.05 (two-sided test) was considered 
189 
statistically significant. We included missing values as separate groups in the models. We adjusted for 
190 
the following covariates: maternal age (<25, 25–34, or ≥35 years), calendar year of birth (1996–1999, 
191 
2000–2003, or 2004–2006), parity (1st/2nd or higher), maternal smoking during pregnancy (yes/no), 
192 
place of residence (capital or capital suburb, provincial city or town, or rural areas), income status 
193 
(lowest quartile/above lowest quartile), education (elementary school/above elementary school), and 
194 
paternal asthma (yes/no) at the time of childbirth. Data on these covariates were extracted from the 
195 
registers mentioned above as well as from Statistics Denmark’s registers on socioeconomic status.24 
196 
Death of a close relative (a child, partner/spouse, a parent, or a sibling) is considered to be one of the 
197 
most stressful life events.25 Maternal stress during pregnancy contributes to both maternal active 
198 
asthma and alter fetal innate and adaptive immune response, predisposing to asthma.26, 27 We, therefore, 
199 
further adjusted for maternal bereavement from one year before or during pregnancy (yes/no), retrieved 
200 
from the Danish Registers of Causes of Death.28  
201 
 
202 
To test whether maternal asthma was associated with an increased prevalence of offspring asthma, we 
203 
compared the PRs of three phenotypes of asthma in children of asthmatic mothers to children of non-
204 
asthmatic mothers. To examine whether the associations between maternal asthma and offspring 
205 
asthma was confounded by shared environmental or genetic variables,29 we included comparisons with 
206 
 12 
 
associations between paternal asthma and offspring asthma. Maternal and paternal asthma were 
207 
mutually adjusted for in the models.  
208 
 
209 
To determine whether the prevalence of three phenotypes of asthma was influenced by maternal asthma 
210 
severity and control, we restricted our analysis to children of mothers with active asthma during 
211 
pregnancy. We compared the PRs of phenotypes of asthma in children of mothers who had mild 
212 
uncontrolled asthma, moderate-to-severe controlled, or moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma to 
213 
those of mild controlled asthmatic mothers.  
214 
 
215 
Sensitivity analysis 
216 
We implemented four sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results. First, mothers with no 
217 
asthma diagnosis but on antiasthmatic treatment may potentially have asthma. We, therefore, repeated 
218 
our analyses by excluding mothers who redeemed any antiasthmatic prescription before delivery from 
219 
the non-asthmatic group. Second, evidence indicates that there may be a sex-specific interplay between 
220 
the mother, placenta, and the fetus.30 To account for the fetal sex-specific differences, we recalculated 
221 
the PRs by stratifying on the sex of the child. Third, 5.2% of the values were missing for any of the 
222 
potential confounders. We imputed missing values with the most common values and re-ran all 
223 
analyses. Fourth, to study whether the associations were modified by the definition of asthma control, 
224 
we redefined asthma control by considering moderate-to-severe exacerbation only.  
225 
 
226 
Ethics 
227 
The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (Journal no: 2015-57-0002). According 
228 
to Danish law, no informed consent is required for a register-based study based on anonymized data. 
229

Results 
230 
Of 675,379 children, 15,014 (2.2%) children were born to asthmatic mothers, among whom 7,188 
231 
(1.1%) to mothers with active asthma during pregnancy. Asthmatic mothers were younger, more often 
232 
smoked during pregnancy and had shorter education than non-asthmatic mothers. Mothers with active 
233 
asthma during pregnancy were more likely to be older and multiparous, smoke less often, and have 
234 
longer education than asthmatic mothers with no active asthma (Table 1). 
235 
 
236 
Parental asthma and offspring asthma. A total of 56,438 (8.4%) children were classified as having 
237 
early-onset transient asthma, 45,900 (6.8%) as having early-onset persistent asthma, and 21,858 (3.2%) 
238 
as having late-onset asthma. Both maternal and paternal asthma were associated with increased 
239 
prevalence of three phenotypes of asthma, whereas more pronounced associations were observed 
240 
between maternal asthma and offspring asthma (P-values for PR differences were < 0.05). Maternal 
241 
asthma was more strongly associated with offspring early-onset persistent asthma (PR=2.11, 95% CI: 
242 
2.03–2.20), as opposed to early-onset transient (PR=1.42, 95% CI: 1.36–1.48) and late-onset asthma 
243 
(PR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.77–2.02), compared to non-asthmatic mothers (P-values for comparing the PR 
244 
differences between early-onset persistent, early-onset transient and late-onset asthma were < 0.01). 
245 
Children of asthmatic mothers with no active asthma during pregnancy also had an increased 
246 
prevalence of three phenotypes of asthma, although a more elevated prevalence was observed among 
247 
children of mothers with active asthma during pregnancy (P-values for PR differences were <0.05) 
248 
(Table 2).  
249 
 
250 
Severity and control of maternal asthma and offspring asthma. Higher prevalence of early-onset 
251 
persistent asthma was observed among children of mothers with mild uncontrolled asthma (PR=1.19, 
252 
 14 
 
95% CI: 1.05–1.35), moderate-to-severe controlled asthma (PR=1.33, 95% CI:1.09–1.63), and 
253 
moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma (PR=1.37, 95% CI:1.17–1.61), compared to those of mothers 
254 
with mild controlled asthma. A borderline increased prevalence of early-onset transient asthma was 
255 
observed among children of mothers with uncontrolled asthma. Maternal asthma severity and control 
256 
was not associated with offspring late-onset asthma (Figure 2).  
257 
 
258 
Sensitivity analyses. We excluded 76,542 pregnancies by mothers who redeemed antiasthmatic 
259 
prescription but with no asthma diagnosis to ensure not to misclassify asthmatic mothers with no 
260 
hospital treatment as non-asthmatic mothers. After exclusion, children to asthmatic mothers had 
261 
increased prevalence of early-onset transient asthma (PR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.44–1.56), early-onset 
262 
persistent asthma (PR=2.34, 95% CI: 2.24–2.43), and late-onset asthma (PR=2.00, 95% CI: 1.88–2.13), 
263 
compared to children of non-asthmatic mothers. The associations between the severity and control of 
264 
maternal asthma and offspring three phenotypes of asthma were not modified by the sex of the child 
265 
(P-values for interaction were greater than 0.15) (Table E2 in the Supplement). Similar results were 
266 
obtained when we imputed the missing values with the most common values (Results not shown). The 
267 
results remained identical by redefining asthma control according to moderate-to-severe exacerbations, 
268 
although the association between mild uncontrolled asthma and offspring early-onset persistent asthma 
269 
was no longer significant (Figure E1 in the supplement).  
270 
 
271 
Discussion 
272 
In this population-based cohort study, we found that children of asthmatic mothers had a higher 
273 
prevalence of all three phenotypes of asthma, compared to those of non-asthmatic mothers. A stronger 
274 
association was observed with early-onset persistent asthma as opposed to early-onset transient or late-
275 
 15 
 
onset asthma. Maternal moderate-to-severe or uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy was associated 
276 
with an increased prevalence of offspring early-onset persistent asthma and a borderline increased 
277 
prevalence of early-onset transient asthma, compared to children of mothers with mild controlled

We found increased prevalence of three phenotypes of asthma among children of asthmatic mothers. 
281 
This increased prevalence was observed among children of asthmatic mothers with no active asthma 
282 
during pregnancy, providing evidence for a genetic predisposition of asthma. Such a genetic 
283 
susceptibility has frequently been noted.15, 31-34 In addition to genetic predisposition, two lines of 
284 
evidence suggest that maternal asthma may also affect offspring asthma via environmental exposures. 
285 
First, we found that maternal asthma conferred a greater risk than paternal asthma, which is consistent 
286 
with most of the previous observations.33, 34 Second, adding to this assumption, we observed a higher 
287 
prevalence of three phenotypes of asthma among children of mothers with active asthma during 
288 
pregnancy than those of asthmatic mothers with no active symptoms.  
289 
 
290 
We found a stronger association between maternal asthma and early-onset persistent asthma as opposed 
291 
to early-onset transient and late-onset asthma, which is in line with existing studies.15, 16 Our finding 
292 
supports the hypothesis that asthma is a not a single disorder, but consists of several phenotypes which 
293 
have different associations with risk factors.14-16  
294 
 
295 
A higher prevalence of early-onset persistent asthma and a borderline increased prevalence of early-
296 
onset transient asthma were seen in children of asthmatic mothers with uncontrolled asthma. Our 
297 
finding is in agreement with one previous study.13 The underlying mechanisms linking uncontrolled 
298 
 16 
 
asthma and offspring early-onset transient or persistent asthma have not been defined. A child’s 
299 
susceptibility to the development of asthma is determined by both a genetic risk/heritability and 
300 
environmental exposures. Maternal uncontrolled asthma may be a distinct phenotype from controlled 
301 
asthma and confer different susceptibility to offspring asthma.35 Furthermore, it is known that parental 
302 
or grandparental asthma may induce epigenetic changes that can be inherited to the next generation as 
303 
observed in experimental studies.36, 37 Epigenetic characteristics and airway inflammation are 
304 
interrelated.38 Thus, maternal uncontrolled asthma might influence the risk of offspring asthma 
305 
independent of genetic heritability. In addition to genetic susceptibility and epigenetic regulations, 
306 
maternal uncontrolled asthma may also influence offspring asthma through environmental exposures, 
307 
both in-utero or during upbringing. Martinez et al.14 reported that children with early-onset transient 
308 
and early-onset persistent asthma had reduced lung function. It is possible that uncontrolled asthma 
309 
may amplify the effect of maternal asthma on fetal hypoxia, with consequences for reduced fetal 
310 
growth and impaired lung development of the fetus through alterations in placental function.39 Another 
311 
possible explanation for the observed association is a shared physical or social environment between 
312 
the mothers and children. These above-mentioned possible underlying mechanisms may not be 
313 
mutually exclusive but might coexist. We found that maternal moderate-to-severe asthma, regardless of 
314 
whether or not it was controlled, was predictive of offspring early-onset asthma. In addition to the 
315 
mechanisms proposed above, another possible interpretation is that moderate-to-severe asthma is a 
316 
different asthma phenotype and conveys a greater risk of asthma to the offspring. Little knowledge is 
317 
currently available about the potential mechanisms linking maternal asthma severity and control and 
318 
asthma phenotypes in the offspring. Future studies, in particular studies on mechanistic investigations, 
319 
are warranted to confirm our findings.  
320 
 17 
 
Poor asthma control constitutes a risk factor that potentially can be targeted in clinical practice and 
321 
intervened upon, with nonadherence and inhaler misuse being two most common reasons that hinder 
322 
better asthma control.40 It is reported that 24% of women do not take prescribed antiasthmatics during 
323 
pregnancy,41 and the frequency of poor inhaler technique ranges from 41% to 54%.42 Noncompliance 
324 
and inhaler misuse can be difficult to detect as they are not routinely evaluated.40 It is, therefore, 
325 
essential for health professionals to be alert to the possibility of noncompliance and improper inhaler 
326 
technique when women experienced poor asthma control.  
327 
 
328 
Strengths and limitations 
329 
Important strengths of the present study included being representative, large sample size, and sufficient 
330 
power to investigate the impact of several levels of maternal asthma severity and control on phenotypes 
331 
of offspring asthma. We used validated indexes for categorizing asthma severity and control. Data on 
332 
asthma severity and control have been collected prospectively and independently of the outcome, thus 
333 
avoid recall bias. We investigated three phenotypes of asthma respectively, which may be more 
334 
informative for mechanism exploration.  
335 
 
336 
Several methodological features should be accounted for. First, we determined maternal asthma 
337 
severity and control based on dispensed prescriptions and the patient register, with no clinical 
338 
measurements. We did not have information on the allergic status of asthma. Therefore we cannot 
339 
discriminate between the influence of maternal allergic and non-allergic asthma on offspring asthma. 
340 
Although the definition used in our study has been validated against pulmonary function tests in a 
341 
previous study,21 we may still have misclassified the level of asthma severity and control. It is probable 
342 
that women with mild uncontrolled asthma may comprise a heterogeneous group, and some of them are 
343 
 18 
 
moderate-to-severe cases. Inversely, due to over-treatment, women with moderate-to-severe controlled 
344 
asthma may be mild asthma cases. Such misclassifications would bias the effect estimate of mild 
345 
uncontrolled and moderate-to-severe asthma toward each other and overestimate the influence of mild 
346 
uncontrolled asthma. Second, asthma in the offspring was identified using patient and prescription 
347 
registers. It is possible that children with mild asthma who did not seek health services were not 
348 
included. Conversely, not all the children who redeemed asthma medications had been diagnosed with 
349 
asthma. It seems, however, the outcome misclassification would be nondifferential and would have 
350 
biased the findings toward the null.43 Moreover, we determined asthma phenotypes according to 
351 
asthma treatment during 0–3 years and 4–6 years. Some asthmatic children may seek medical treatment 
352 
at a later stage. We would thus have misclassified the timing of treatment, leading to the 
353 
misclassification of asthma phenotypes. This misclassification would be nondifferential and bias the 
354 
prevalence ratios of three phenotypes toward one another.43 Third, despite the numerous confounders 
355 
adjusted for in our models, some residual confounding from unmeasured confounders such as father’s 
356 
smoking may still prevail. Lastly, although our study indicates an association between maternal 
357 
uncontrolled asthma and offspring early-onset asthma, our study is limited by its observational nature. 
358 
We were not able to assess the extent to which better optimization of asthma control during pregnancy 
359 
reduces risk of early-onset asthma in the offspring.    
360 
 
361 
Conclusion: Maternal uncontrolled and moderate-to-severe asthma during pregnancy increases the risk 
362 
of both offspring early-onset persistent and transient asthma. If replicated, this could suggest that 
363 
maintaining asthma control in pregnancy is an area for possible prevention of specific phenotypes of 
364 
offspring asthma. Moreover, further studies are needed that more directly examine potential 
365 
 19 
 
mechanisms underlying the association between uncontrolled asthma in pregnancy and offspring 
366 
asthma risk.

Figure 2. Prevalence ratios of early-onset transient, early-onset persistent, and late-onset asthma 
according to maternal asthma severity and control among children of asthmatic mothers with active 
asthma during pregnancy (N=7,188) 
 
Abbrevations: PR, prevalence ratio; CI, confidence interval. 
Early-onset transient asthma—asthma treatment during 0–3 years but no treatment during 4–6 years of age; Early-onset persistent 
asthma—asthma treatment both during 0–3 years and during 4–6 years of age; Late-onset asthma—no asthma treatment during 0–3 years 
but with treatment during 4–6 years of age.  
Children of mothers with mild controlled asthma in pregnancy were used as the reference group for estimating the prevalence ratios of 
asthma among children of mothers with mild uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe controlled and moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma in 
pregnancy. Adjusted for maternal age at delivery, parity, smoking during pregnancy, maternal bereavement prior to or during pregnancy, 
place of residence at delivery, income status, education status, calendar year of birth, and paternal asthma before delivery.
