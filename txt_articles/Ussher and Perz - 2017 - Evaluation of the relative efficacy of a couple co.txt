Abstract
Design
A randomised control trial (RCT) was conducted to examine the efficacy of couple-based
cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for Premenstrual Disorders (PMDs), in comparison to
one-to-one CBT and a wait-list control.
Methods
Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative outcome measures evaluated changes pre-post
intervention. Eighty three women were randomly allocated across three conditions, with 63
completing post-intervention measures, a retention rate of 76%.
Results
Repeated measures analysis of variance found a significant time by group interaction identi-
fying that women in the two CBT conditions reported lower total premenstrual symptoms,
emotional reactivity/mood, and premenstrual distress, in comparison to the wait list control.
Significantly higher active behavioural coping post-intervention was found in the couple con-
dition than in the one-to-one and wait list control groups. Qualitative analysis provided insight
into the subjective experience of PMDs and participation in the intervention study. Across
groups, women reported increased awareness and understanding of premenstrual change
post-intervention. A larger proportion of women in the CBT conditions reported reduction in
intensity and frequency of negative premenstrual emotional reactivity, increased communica-
tion and help-seeking, increased understanding and acceptance of embodied change, and
the development of coping skills, post-intervention. Increased partner understanding and
improved relationship post-intervention was reported by a greater proportion of participants
in the CBT conditions, most markedly in the couple condition.

 Conclusion
These findings suggest that one-to-one and couple CBT interventions can significantly
reduce women’s premenstrual symptomatology and distress, and improve premenstrual
coping. Couple based CBT interventions may have a greater positive impact upon beha-
vioural coping and perceptions of relationship context and support. This suggests that CBT
should be available for women reporting moderate-severe PMDs, with couple-based CBT
offering additional benefits to a one-to-one modality.
Introduction
Premenstrual change is experienced by up to 90% of women, with up to 40% experiencing mod-
erate distress, categorised by clinicians and researchers as Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) [1],
and 2–5% experiencing severe distress and disruption to their lives, categorised as Premenstrual
Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) [2]. Recognition of the continuum of premenstrual distress, and
overlap between the diagnostic categories PMS and PMDD, has led to the adoption of the term
‘Premenstrual Disorders’ (PMDs) by an expert advisory panel [3]. PMDs include emotional
and behavioural symptoms that have a significant impact on a woman’s quality of life during
the premenstrual phase of the cycle, but are absent after menstruation and before ovulation.
The symptoms most commonly reported include irritability, depression, mood swings, anxiety,
concentration difficulties, feelings of loss of control and tiredness, often combined with physical
symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness, headache and general body aches [4].
The costs of PMDs, in terms of impact upon women’s quality of life and economic function-
ing, are estimated to be considerable [1, 5]. This has led to the development of a range of bio-
medical interventions, including the use of anti-depressants of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI) class, anxiolytics and hormone treatments to suppress ovulation, and oophorectomy [3,
4]. Although these approaches may be effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms, they do
not take account of the complex mechanisms underlying premenstrual distress that are not ade-
quately accounted for by physiology alone [6, 7]. Furthermore, many women express a prefer-
ence for non-medical treatment options for their premenstrual symptoms [8], due to side
effects [9], or contraindications to drug treatments [10]. Consequently, there has been a devel-
opment of psychological approaches to PMDs treatment [11], that take into account the interac-
tion of embodied, cognitive and socio-cultural factors in the development of symptoms [12].
The results of systematic review [10] and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [13,
14] suggest that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) can reduce premenstrual anxiety and
depression, have a beneficial impact on behavioural change, and reduce interference of pre-
menstrual symptoms on daily living [15, 16–18]. Such interventions involve a combination of
behavioural strategies such as relaxation training, coping skills, social support, and anger man-
agement [19–21], combined with facilitation of cognitive restructuring to overcome the sense
of helplessness associated with premenstrual symptoms and reframe self-defeating cognitions
[11, 22]. CBT has been demonstrated to be as effective as SSRI’s in reducing premenstrual dis-
tress in the short-term, and at long term follow-up to be more effective, in terms of reducing
premenstrual distress and improving coping [14, 17].
Relational context of premenstrual distress
A limitation of existing psychological or medical interventions for PMDs is that the focus
is on the woman who reports distress. This negates research evidence that has found that

 premenstrual distress is often a relational experience, developing, and being positioned as
‘PMS’, within the context of interactions with partners or children [23]. Using a short fuse
metaphor, women report greater reactivity to family stresses and altered perception of daily
life stresses premenstrually [24, 25].Women, and their families, may also attribute premen-
strual expression of negative emotion to ‘PMS’, even when alternative explanations can be
found, which leads to women’s emotions being positioned as a hormonal pathology [12].
Direct expression of emotion has been reported to be lower in families where women report
PMDs [26], which increases the likelihood of premenstrual emotion being positioned as
problematic.
Many women who report PMDs also report higher levels of relationship dissatisfaction or
difficulties [26–31]. There is evidence that both women and their partners evaluate the rela-
tionship more negatively in the premenstrual phase, suggesting that some couples are not sim-
ply distressed, but rather, are distressed in the luteal phase of the cycle [32, 33]. It has also been
reported that premenstrual anger and irritation is associated with legitimate relationship con-
flicts, with feelings of dissatisfaction being openly expressed during the premenstrual phase of
the cycle [34, 35]. This is in contrast to women’s self-silencing during the remainder of the
month, where they take up a position of self-sacrifice and self-renunciation [36], in an attempt
to live up to idealised notions of femininity [37]. Whilst some women describe the premen-
strual expression of negative emotion as cathartic in the short term, this catharsis is invariably
followed by guilt, self-criticism, and a positioning of the premenstrual self as ‘out of control’
[38, 39]. It is thus the break in self-silencing premenstrually, described as a transgression from
the ‘real me’, which leads to distress, as well as to self-castigation [36].
The role of partners in the exacerbation or amelioration of premenstrual distress has been
demonstrated in a number of studies. The coping responses of men have been found to be a
strong predictor of women’s symptom severity, with high levels of premenstrual distress asso-
ciated with a partner’s avoidance, fear, and anger, and low levels of distress associated with
reassurance and support [7, 40, 41]. Men’s constructions of ‘PMS’ have been implicated in
women’s negative premenstrual experiences, with evidence that many men treat women with
PMDs in a belittling way [42, 43]. At the same time, some male partners of women with PMDs
report that they experience moderate to significant disruption in their lives due to their part-
ner’s premenstrual change [30, 32], or report that they wished they had married someone else
[44], describing the premenstrual period as like walking on eggshells [36].
The findings of the above body of research have led to the suggestion that PMDs is not an
individual problem, but a relational issue [12, 33], and that coping with moderate-severe
PMDs requires effort from both members of a couple [41]. In this vein, family or couple ther-
apy has been suggested as an appropriate form of intervention for PMDs [45]. In couple ther-
apy, it is not necessarily the relationship that becomes the focus of treatment, rather, the
involvement of the partner in the therapy process enhances symptom alleviation and reduces
relationship distress [46]. Frank and colleagues [30] investigated the impact of including male
partners in the monitoring of a woman’s behavioural and emotional premenstrual symptoms
and reported significant improvement in relationship functioning and reduction in premen-
strual distress compared to a self-monitoring control group. Awareness of cyclical patterns
meant that couples could develop joint strategies to deal with potential problems, and discuss
major issues at times other than the premenstrual phase. A subsequent small scale couple
intervention, comparing a PMDs and non-PMDs control, reported positive effects of time, but
no difference between groups [47]. There have been no other systematic evaluations of couple-
based interventions for PMDs, and no comparisons of the efficacy of individual and couple
CBT interventions in reducing premenstrual distress. Previous research on the efficacy of CBT
in reducing premenstrual distress has also been criticised for the absence of wait-list control

 groups, small sample size, absence of random group assignment, and failure to use using
repeated measures ANOVA to assess main effects of group, main effects of time, and time by
group interactions [10]. There is also an absence of a qualitative examination of the subjective
experience and mechanisms of change pre-post intervention, with the exception of one study
[48]. There has been a call for the addition of qualitative methods to RCT’s, in order to address
complexity, context, and meaning of change, along-side quantitative measures of outcome
[49]
The aim of the present study was to address these gaps in the research literature, through
the evaluation of the relative efficacy of a couple-based CBT intervention in comparison to a
one-to-one CBT intervention and a wait-list control, in reducing premenstrual symptoms and
distress, and in improving premenstrual coping, using a randomised controlled trial, and a tri-
angulation of outcome measures. The impact of the interventions on depression and anxiety,
self-silencing, and relationship adjustment were also examined, to ascertain changes in general
wellbeing, relationship functioning and communication.
Materials and methods
Design
A randomised control trial (RCT) was conducted to examine the relative efficacy of a brief
couple-based intervention for PMDs, in comparison to a proven one-to-one CBT PMDs inter-
vention and a wait-list control. This allows for the comparison of active treatment with absence
of treatment, and the comparison of two active treatments. Triangulation of quantitative and
qualitative outcome measures was used to evaluate changes pre-post intervention.
Participants and procedure
Women who reported moderate-severe PMDs were recruited from a range of contexts, includ-
ing social media, sexual and reproductive health clinics, local radio and newspapers, and wom-
en’s health centres. Women who were interested in the study were informed about the nature
of the study, and then completed an on-line survey which examined demographic variables,
the nature and degree of their premenstrual distress, degree of premenstrual coping, and part-
ner support. Participants were eligible if they were aged between 18–45 years, having regular
cycles (21–35 days); presently not taking hormonal medication (excluding contraceptives),
psychotropic medication, or having been diagnosed with a major psychiatric illness; not hav-
ing been pregnant or lactating within the previous 12 months. Criteria for a PMDs diagnosis
were assessed with the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) [50], with confirma-
tion by daily diary measures [51], demonstrating a 30% difference in symptoms between the
pre- and post-menstrual period, for two consecutive months, which cause moderate-severe
impairment [3, 52, 53]. If women did not report a 30% increase in premenstrual symptoms
after two cycles, they were invited to complete a third, and sometimes fourth, cycle of daily dia-
ries. The baseline pre-screening survey was completed by 1124 participants, with 584 partici-
pants invited to complete daily diaries (Table 1). Those who met the criteria for a PMDs
diagnosis following daily dairies and agreed to take part (N = 96) were then randomly allocated
to one of three treatment groups—couple-based, one-to-one, or wait-list control. Minimum
sample sizes of 30 women per group have been recommended for PMS research [54] and
‘large samples’ have been suggested for research examining the relative efficacy of couple ther-
apy [46]. An a priori sample calculation analysis on G�Power for a repeated measures ANOVA
(incorporating interaction effects) for 3 groups, a power of 0.95, a two-way alpha level of 0.01
to adjust for multiple comparisons, and a medium effect size (f = .25), computed a required
total sample size of 90. Generation of the random allocation sequence, using permuted block

 randomization [55], was conducted by the second author (JP). Allocation of participants to
conditions was conducted by a researcher who was not involved in the delivery of interven-
tion. Participants were recruited between 1st March 2012 and 31st December 2012, with quan-
titative and qualitative data collected between 1st March 2012 and 7th May 2014.
Randomised participants completed a series of questionnaires and open ended survey items
immediately prior to study entry, at post-intervention (5 months), and for both treatment
groups, at three-month follow-up. This included measures of premenstrual symptoms, pre-
menstrual distress and coping, depression and anxiety, relationship adjustment, and self-
silencing. Ten women from each of the three conditions were interviewed pre- and post-inter-
vention, and ten from each of the treatment groups interviewed at follow-up. Following Blake
and colleagues [18], participants in the wait list control condition were not required to com-
plete the three-month follow-up questionnaires or interviews for ethical considerations. All
wait list participants were provided with a previously validated self-help CBT package post-
intervention [56], and invited to take part in a group meeting with a clinical psychologist to
discuss their PMDs. As a result of a procedural oversight, the authors note that the study was
not publically registered before participant enrolment had begun. The study has been retro-
spectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR),
ACTRN: ACTRN12616000932460 and no changes were made to the study protocol or out-
comes after the trial commenced. The authors confirm that there are no ongoing or related tri-
als for this intervention. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and
ethics approval was received from the Western Sydney University Human Research Ethics
Committee (31st January 2012, H6698).
Interventions
The one-to-one intervention was based on a woman-centred PMDs CBT intervention previ-
ously demonstrated to be effective in reducing premenstrual distress in both a face-to face [17]
and self-help modality [56]. It consisted of four 90-minute sessions, conducted over a five-

 month period (three sessions offered on a monthly basis, and one session at two month fol-
low-up), delivered by a woman clinical psychologist. The aims of the intervention were to
examine women’s attributions for premenstrual distress within a bio-psycho-social frame-
work, and to challenge negative self-blaming beliefs that may exacerbate symptomatology,
such as “I should be calm and controlled all of the time”, “I should always be able to cope”, “I
shouldn’t be angry or irritable”. Behavioural coping skills, including relaxation training, taking
time out for self-care, diet and exercise were also examined and encouraged across the men-
strual cycle. Finally, the relational context of premenstrual distress was explored, and assertive-
ness training techniques used to encourage calm expression of emotion, concerns or needs
throughout the month [22]. Women were given homework following each of the sessions and
a written booklet containing detailed information about each session, to supplement the meet-
ings with the psychologist. The couple intervention followed the same format, with inclusion
of Couples Dialogue techniques [57] to facilitate couple communication. This allows for the
active involvement of the woman’s partner in understanding PMDs, and in strategies of pre-
vention and amelioration.
Measures
Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) [50] is a 19 item measure used to identify
women who suffer from severe PMDs and who are likely to benefit from treatment. For this
study, premenstrual symptoms were treated as a continuous variable to allow for changes in
the degree of severity to be assessed. A principal components analysis was run on the 14 pre-
menstrual symptoms at pre-test for all participants. A three-component solution explained
67.14% of the total variance and varimax orthogonal rotation was used to aid interpretability.
The factors were interpreted as the subscales: Emotional reactivity/mood (5 items); Lack of
energy/interest (5 items); and Physical symptoms (4 items). Scores for each subscale were cal-
culated by summing raw scores corresponding to all items loading on a factor along with a
total symptom score. The identified symptom subscale profiles were similar to those found in
previous factor analyses with the PSST [58].
Subjective Evaluation of PMDs questionnaire (SEPQ) [56] examines experiences of pre-
menstrual change two 10 point Likert scales: “To what extent do you find your PMS distress-
ing?” and “To what extent do you feel that you can deal with your PMS?”
The Premenstrual Coping Checklist (PMCC) [59] is comprised of 38 items which reflect four
principle premenstrual coping strategies termed active-behavioural, active-cognitive, avoid-
ance and menstrual cycle specific (scale of 1–4).
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [60], is a 14 item validated self-report
measure developed to measure anxiety (HADSA) and depression (HADSD) in non-psychiat-
ric populations. A score of between 8 and above is recommended for “caseness”, the cut-off for
clinical diagnosis [61].
The Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) [62] is a 32-item self-report scale that assesses the
quality of couple relationships. Results are summated with high scores indicating greater satis-
faction and low scores conflict between the couple.
Silencing the Self Scale (STSS) [63, 64] is a standardised questionnaire consisting of 31
items measuring the extent to which individuals endorse self-silencing thoughts and actions,
using a 5 point Likert scale. In addition to a Global score, the four subscales are: Care as Self-
Sacrifice; Silencing the Self; Externalised Self Perception; and The Divided Self.
Subjective experience of premenstrual change and the intervention.
In the open ended
survey items, participants were asked about their perception of premenstrual change at pre
and post intervention, and their experiences of participating in the treatment program, in

 relation to feelings about other people, feelings about the body, relationship issues associated
with premenstrual feelings, and post-intervention, positive consequences of the study.
Interviews.
Interviews are increasingly being used in the social and behavioural sciences
as a means of examining the subjective construction and meaning of experience [65, 66].
Semi-structured one-to-one interviews were conducted with 10 women randomly selected
from each of the three conditions, pre and post-intervention. A sample size of 10 was deemed
sufficient to reach saturation (no new themes in three consecutive interviews), and follows rec-
ommendations for sample size for qualitative research [66]. The interview schedule has been
previously used to examine moderate-severe PMS in both the UK and Australia [67–69], and
asked women to describe the course and development of premenstrual distress and recount a
typical experience of ‘PMS’ in the context of relationships. Post-intervention, the same ques-
tions were asked, with a focus on how the intervention has impacted in each of these areas.
Interviews were digitally recorded and took approximately 60 minutes.
Analysis
Statistical analysis.
Univariate analyses were conducted to compare participants in the
three intervention conditions for each of the socio-demographic variables of interest. For con-
tinuous variables, one-way ANOVA were conducted with intervention used as the grouping
variable, and the chi square test for independence used for frequency data. Descriptive fre-
quency analyses were used to examine baseline/follow-up retention rates across intervention
conditions. For each intervention condition, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (status:
completer vs. non-completer) was conducted with pre-test outcome variables. Chi square anal-
yses were used to assess group differences in PMDs cases at post-intervention, and at follow-up
in the two active conditions. One-way ANOVA (intervention: couple-based vs. one-to-one vs.
wait-list control) was performed on outcome variables to assess baseline differences between
the intervention groups. Due to violations in the assumptions of homogeneity of regression
coefficients for the outcome measures, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with pre-test scores
as covariates was not used. A series of mixed 2 (time: pre vs. post) x 3 (intervention: couple-
based vs. one-to-one vs. wait-list control) ANOVA were conducted for each outcome variable.
Follow-up comparisons for each outcome variable were tested with separate mixed 2 (time: post
vs. follow-up) x 2 (intervention: couple-based vs. one-to-one) ANOVA. Where significant inter-
action effects were found, the simple main effect of intervention group was tested with one-way
ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA for time. The expectation–maximization (EM) algo-
rithm was used to estimate missing data in the ANOVA models tested. An alpha level of .01 was
used to adjust for multiple comparisons in the primary statistical tests, whereas .05 was used for
all other statistical tests. IBM SPSS 24 statistical software was used for the analyses.
Qualitative analysis.
Thematic analysis [70] was used to analyse the open ended survey
responses and interviews. This involved independent reading of responses to each question by
two members of the research team, in order to ascertain the major themes emerging, and to
develop a coding frame, based on notions of consistency, commonality, and the function and
effects of specific themes. The entire data set was then coded, using NVivo–a software package
that assists with the organisation and analysis of textual data. Following coding, the percentage
of responses for the open ended survey responses was calculated within each theme, across
intervention conditions, to ascertain the magnitude of changes pre-post intervention within
and between groups. The open ended survey items were double-blind coded; interrater reli-
ability was high (Cohen’s Kappa = .89). Conceptually clustered matrices [71] were used to
organise and display the main themes that emerge from the open ended survey items pre-post
intervention.

 Results
Participant profile
Ninety six women who satisfied PMDs criteria and agreed to take part in the intervention with
their partners were allocated into one of the three intervention conditions (Fig 1). Thirteen
women declined to participate following allocation, for reasons including change in circum-
stances and dissatisfaction with the intervention condition they had been allocated to. Of the
83 participants who commenced the study, 63 completed post measures representing an over-
all retention rate of 76% post-test. The retention to follow-up was higher in the one-to-one
group (70%) compared to 54% for the couple-based group.

 Baseline participant demographic data for the 83 women who completed pre-intervention
measures is presented in Table 1 by group. The average age of women (mean (M) = 34.79, stan-
dard deviation (SD) = 8.01) did not significantly differ between groups. Eighty two participants
were heterosexual, and one identified as lesbian. All women were partnered and with the
majority living with their partner, and had an average length of current relationship of 9.27
years (SD = 7.32). Contraceptive use was varied across the sample, but did not significantly dif-
fer between groups. No statistical differences on pre-test outcome variables were found
between participants who completed the interventions and assessments and non-completers
(lost to follow-up and discontinued) in each intervention group
Group baseline comparisons
One-way ANOVA for pre-test measures showed no significant differences between partici-
pants in the three intervention groups (p values � .17) as reported in Table 1. Level of premen-
strual symptoms was high, with all participants meeting criteria for a PMDs diagnosis (PSTT)
(Table 2). Self-reported premenstrual distress was high (>7), whilst ratings of premenstrual
coping were moderate (4–5) (SEPQ) (Table 1). Ratings of the use and helpfulness of various
strategies for coping with menstrual cycle changes (PMCC) were low. Dyadic adjustment
(DAS) and self-silencing (STSS) scores at baseline were comparable to published norms for
non-clinical populations, and were in the normal range. HADS depression scores across
groups were within the normal range, whilst HADS anxiety scores across groups indicated lev-
els of mild anxiety.

 Changes in outcomes measures at post-test by treatment group
The mean scores for all outcome measures at pre-test and post-test for each intervention
group are shown in Table 2.
For pre-test to post-test comparisons, a significant time main effect was revealed on all vari-
ables, with the exception of relationship adjustment, menstrual specific coping and avoidance
coping. Significant reductions were found for total premenstrual symptoms (PSTT) (F1,57 =
22.16, p < .001, n2p = .28), as well as for the subscales of emotional reactivity/mood (F1,57 =
21.72, p < .001, n2p = .28), lack of energy/interest (F1,57 = 11.40, p = .001, n2p = .17), and physi-
cal symptoms (F1,57 = 7.33, p = .009, n2p = .11). Significant reductions were also found for pre-
menstrual distress (SEPQ) (F1,60 = 95.77, p < .001, n2p = .62), self–silencing (STSS) (F1,60 =
15.18, p < .001, n2p = .20), depression (F1,60 = 24.03, p < .001, n2p = .29), and anxiety (HADS)
(F1,60 = 15.22, p < .001, n2p = .20), with significant improvements over time for premenstrual
coping (SEPQ) (F1,60 = 102.86, p < .001, n2p = .63), active behavioural coping (PMCC)(F1,60 =
13.78, p < .001, n2p = .19) and active cognitive coping (PMCC) (F1,60 = 31.63, p < .001, n2p =
.35). Main effect differences between intervention groups and interactions were not signifi-
cant, for lack of energy/interest and physical premenstrual symptoms (PSTT), avoidance cop-
ing (PMCC), relationship satisfaction (DAS), self-silencing (STSS), depression and anxiety
(HADS). There was a statistically significant interaction between intervention group and time
for total premenstrual symptoms (F2,57 = 4.74, p = .01, n2p = .14) and emotional reactivity/
mood (F2,57 = 5.35, p = .01, n2p = .16) (PSTT); premenstrual distress (F2,60 = 14.60, p < .001,
n2p = .33) and premenstrual coping (F2,60 = 6.64, p = .002, n2p = .18) (SEPQ); and active cogni-
tive coping (F2,60 = 6.12, p = .004, n2p = .17) (PMCC).
Post-hoc ANOVA tested significant interaction effects. Post-intervention, total pre-
menstrual symptoms (PSTT) were significantly higher in the wait-list control group com-
pared to the couple intervention (MD = 6.25, SE = 2.55, p = .045) but not the one-to-one
group, with no significant difference between the two active intervention groups. A statis-
tically significant effect of time, indicating lower total premenstrual symptoms at post-
intervention, was found for the couple (F1,17 = 8.004, p = .011) and one-to-one groups
(F1,21 = 24.11, p < .001) but not the wait-list control group. Premenstrual distress (SEPQ)
was significantly higher post-intervention in the wait-list control group (MD = 3.14, SE =
0.57, p < .001) compared to the couple intervention and the one-to-one groups (MD =
1.99, SE = 0.54, p = .001), but was not significantly different between the two active treat-
ment groups. There was a statistically significant effect of time, with lower premenstrual
distress at post-intervention for the couple (F1,18 = 53.78, p < .001) and one-to-one groups
(F1,22 = 50.76, p < .001), but not the wait-list control group. For emotional reactivity/
mood symptoms (PSTT), premenstrual coping (SEPQ), and active cognitive coping
(PMCC), differences between intervention groups were not significant. There was a statis-
tically significant effect of time, with lower emotional reactivity/mood symptoms (PSTT)
at post-intervention for the couple (F1,17 = 46.70, p = .005) and one-to-one groups (F1,21 =
65.05, p < .001) but not the wait-list control group. There was a significant effect of time
with increases in premenstrual coping (SEPQ) at post-test for all groups: couple (F1,18 =
47.55, p < .001), one-to-one (F1,22 = 36.43, p < .001), and wait-list control (F1,20 = 17.50,
p < .001). Active cognitive coping was significantly increased at post-test for the couple
(F1,18 = 29.23, p < .001) and one-to-one groups (F1,22 = 13.33, p = .001) (PMCC).
Participants reported no adverse outcomes to the research team or the University Human
Research Ethics Committee, and no participants withdrew consent during the study.

 Follow-up comparisons
The mean scores for all outcome measures for the couple and one-to-one treatment groups at
follow-up are shown in Table 2. For post-intervention to follow-up comparisons, no signifi-
cant time or interaction effects were revealed on any of the measured variables indicating that
improvements in scores were maintained during the follow-up period.
Change in PMDs status
Chi-squared analyses were used to assess differences in PMDs casesness over time for each
treatment group, and group differences at post-test and follow-up (PSTT) (Table 3). Signifi-
cantly fewer women met PMDs caseness criteria at post-test compared to baseline in all treat-
ment groups: X2
(1,19) = 8.07, p = 0.004 for the couple group; X2
(1,23) = 5.54, p = 0.019 for the
one-to-one group; and X2
(1,21) = 5.09, p = 0.024 for the wait-list control group. The proportion
of women meeting PMDs caseness criteria at follow-up did not significantly differ from post-
test levels for the couple and one-to-one intervention groups. There were no significant differ-
ences in PMDs casesness rates between the intervention groups at post-test, X2
(2,63) = 0.55, p =
0.76, or at follow-up, X2
(1,36) = 0.01, p = 0.94.
Subjective experience of premenstrual change
Emotional reactivity pre-post intervention.
In the open ended survey responses and
interviews, the majority of participants reported feeling differently about those around them in
terms of increased negative emotional reactivity premenstrually, including increased anger,
irritation, and anxiety (Table 4). In the open-ended surveys, post-intervention negative emo-
tional reactivity was reported by a smaller proportion of women within the one-to-one and
couple conditions (reduction of 61% and 64% respectively), compared to the wait list control
(reduction of 35%) (Table 4). This was manifested by a reduction in both intensity and fre-
quency of negative emotion.
Feeling fat and ugly: Women’s feelings about the premenstrual body.
The majority of
participants reported negative feelings towards their bodies when they were premenstrual,
describing themselves as “fat”, “ugly”, “frumpy”, “sluggish”, and “unattractive”. Some of these
negative feelings were associated with embodied changes such as bloating and painful breasts,
but women also described themselves as more “self-conscious” and “self-critical” of their bod-
ies during the premenstrual phase of the cycle. Post-intervention, there was a greater reduction
in such reports in open ended surveys in the couple condition (63%) and one-to-one condition

 (47%), than in the wait list control (25%) (Table 5). This was manifested by greater acceptance
and understanding of embodied change reported by the majority of participants in the one-to-
one (68%) and couple (72%) conditions, and a minority of the wait list control (5%).
Intimate relationship difficulties and support pre-post intervention.
The majority of
women reported exacerbation of relationship tension and intolerance towards their partner in
the premenstrual phase of the cycle (Table 6), using a short-fuse or pressure cooker metaphor.
In the open ended survey responses, there was an 18% reduction in reports of intimate rela-
tionship difficulties within the couple conditions, compared to a 10% increase in the wait list

I can’t stand everyone. I have a very negative outlook
during this time and people’s negative
characteristics/flaws are exacerbated which
infuriates me. Things which are normally minor get to
me and make me super angry (WLC).
I still hate my husband and now believe that my
anger is probably justified and I wonder if those
feelings are really a true indication of how I feel
about him (WLC).
People annoy me more and I can’t stand to be
around children (WLC).
I feel when premenstrual that I want to be
straightforward but sometimes it comes across as
blunt; I have now become better at holding rudeness
from my tone and feel this is an achievement
(WLC).
I’m more sensitive and more easily offended or upset
(WLC).
I can feel the signs–I’m touchy, cranky, irrational,—
so I try to take a step back and start my breathing
techniques. I tell myself everything is OK, just the
way it is and remind myself how important my family
and friends are to me (one to one).
I feel everyone is against me or they are not trying to
understand (one-to-one).
I still experience irritability, but I am not a big ball of
screaming rage any more (one to one)
I am less loving as most things annoy me about
people–especially those close to me (one to one).
I still get that irritation, that frustration. But it’s
probably over a shorter period of time, and maybe it
doesn’t happen as often (one to one)
I get more irritated and am more likely to be sarcastic
and rush people off. I feel a bit more distant from
others as well (one-to-one).
I don’t experience “the highs and lows to the same
extent. I’ve been a lot more stable recently (couple).
I get very angry. Very irritable and that builds up to
being very angry. I don’t want the irritation of having
to talk to other people, let alone deal with requests
and dealing with the needs of small children (one-to-
one).
I don’t experience “the highs and lows to the same
extent. I’ve been a lot more stable recently (couple).
I find people annoying and any minor transgressions
or habits easily upset me or provoke my anger. I
tolerate them less (couple).
I still get frustrated but I can control it better
(couple).
I would prefer to be alone so feel resentful/angry
when people put demands on me that I see as
unnecessary or I don’t want to participate in (couple).
I still get irritated but am now able to keep it in check
by taking a deep breath or telling myself it wasn’t
worth the blood pressure rise (couple).
I get jealous and paranoid “everybody hates me”
syndrome! (couple).

I suppose I just feel ugly, so my dissatisfaction is
with my overall appearance. I usually experience this
very particular kind of irritation where I feel
irrationally fat and hate everything about my figure
and clothes, when I experience this I know my period
will start in a couple of days (WLC).
I feel bloated and it makes me feel like my body take
up more space. I also feel betrayed by my body
(WLC).
Yes. I feel unattractive. I know I still look the same–it
is all in my mind but that doesn’t make me feel any
better. I feel fat. I also will dress differently at that
time of the month (WLC).
I feel disappointed about my body. I feel bloated and
tired so I never look good in anything I wear (WLC).
Yes I hate it. I feel like an elephant, very unattractive
and I over compensate by putting pressure on my
partner. I don’t like looking in the mirror (one-to-one).
Yes absolutely. I feel like a whale and hate my body
during this time. It makes me hide my body and I
wear bigger things to try to do this (WLC).
I like my body less than usual, I feel fat and bloated
and am more aware of my flaws. I am more self-
conscious about my belly and thighs, which feel
flabby, and am less confident about my appearance
and general body shape (one-to-one).
I always feel fat and yuck. I think because I’m
bloated I just feel fat and ugly. I don’t like my body
when I’m premenstrual (one-to-one).
More critical of bumps. Not as good as it once was.
Just fat and ugly (one-to-one).
I still feel bloated and heavy which makes me feel
uncomfortable. I try not to look at my body when like
this to avoid telling myself how bad I look even
though it’s not that much different to the rest of the
month (one-to-one).
I feel more self-conscious–I feel fat and ugly
(couple).
Feel fat and bloated, more self-conscious (couple).
I see all faults and feel that they are larger than they
are (ie stomach, thighs) to the point that I can’t stand
to look at myself (couple).

Yes, after realising the pattern, I feel better about
myself as I feel I am helping myself overcome bad
feelings. I start to love myself at that time of the
month, instead of hating myself (WLC).
Yes, I don’t get as worried when I feel/look a bit
heavier and sometimes I don’t even notice it
anymore (that is, sometimes I don’t feel/look
heavier) (one-to-one).
Yes, I don’t feel so badly about being bloated or
slightly bigger in that time, in fact I hardly notice it
now (one-to-one).

 control (10%) and 5% increase in the one-to-one condition (5%) (Table 6). Post-intervention,
women reported that they were less likely to “lose control” when expressing their feelings, had
increased awareness of the potential for relationship conflict, or described relationship tension
as less problematic.
Increased partner awareness and understanding of the premenstrual phase of the cycle, asso-
ciated with greater support, was reported in 19% of the wait list control, 39% of participants in
the one-to-one condition, and 84% of those in the couple condition post-intervention (Table 7),
in the open-ended survey responses. This was associated with reports of an improved relation-
ship with a woman’s intimate partner, in 57% of participants in the couple condition, 26% in
the one-to-one condition, and 5% of the wait list control (Table 7). These improvements
included resolution of relationship difficulties, greater couple communication, and greater
closeness.
Positive consequences of the intervention: Increased awareness, communication and
coping. Participants reported a number of positive consequences of taking part in the inter-
vention study, in addition to relationship improvement (Table 8). The majority of participants
across conditions reported increased awareness and understanding of premenstrual change,
associated with greater control over emotions, and less anger or irritation towards others. In
the open ended survey responses, women in the two active intervention conditions were more
likely to report improved communication and asking for help following participation in the
study (68% couple condition, 65% one-to-one), than women in the wait list control (9.5%).
This was associated with reports of increased knowledge and comfort in discussing premen-
strual change, learning specific communication skills associated with expressing premenstrual
needs, and awareness of the importance of communication in relationships, and feeling
“understood” by others.
The development of active coping skills to deal with premenstrual changes was reported by
all of the women in the two active conditions, and a third of the women in the wait list control
group. This included self-talk to reduce premenstrual negative moods, changing perceptions
of premenstrual emotion, and recognition of premenstrual needs. Awareness of cyclical

I notice changes in my body (feel bloated in stomach
and thighs) but tell myself ‘this is just because I am
premenstrual, it will be better in a few days’. And my
partner reassures me about my appearance. (one-
to-one).
I am less annoyed by the process and symptoms
and able to relax and accept it (one-to-one).
I understand now that I need to take it easy as my
body is under stress. There is nothing wrong or bad
about my body (one-to-one).
What used to bother me before–bloating and not
liking what I saw in the mirror, now doesn’t seem to
bother me as much, I do not dwell on it as much as I
did before (couple).
I’ve accepted the physical changes my body
undergoes, even though I dislike it, and am easier on
myself (ie. Not thinking I’m fat and ugly all the time)
(couple).
I can now link the brain behaviour to the body
chemistry, so can be more understanding (couple).

 changes facilitated self-care, including avoidance of conflict, active engagement in self-care.
These self-care and coping strategies were reported to have a beneficial effect on women’s
moods, and their ability to control the expression of negative emotion. There was also a posi-
tive benefit for women’s experience of embodied change during the premenstrual phase of the

Oh Yes! I nearly always want to leave the
relationship due to finding fault with him, me, us! Or
leave my home and go far away. I did this many
times in my 20’s before I understood what was going
on with me (WLC).
I am quicker to bring up issues when premenstrual.
Things that don’t bother me normally do bother me
and this affects my relationship (WLC).
Underlying issues in the relationship tend to come up
during my PMS time, as I feel irritable and have low
tolerance. We are more likely to fight at this time
(WLC).
If we have a misunderstanding or poor
communication I get frustrated, that it seems we are
not on the same page, and I feel impatient and will
cause a breakdown in communication (WLC).
if he makes a certain comment or if we’re driving and
he takes the wrong turn I’ll make more of an issue of
it then I would normally (WLC).
I think because I am more aware of a tendency to
fight with my partner now, I try not to bring up issues
around that time (WLC).
We bicker more as I pick more on things my partner
does. He gets in trouble for breathing too heavy or
tapping or jiggling I get so irritable (one-to-one).
The problems I have in my relationships always
seem too hard to deal with when I’m premenstrual
and I always feel like it’s easier to give up and walk
away (one-to-one).
My husband and I have our strongest disagreements
and there is a lot of anger on my part over what are
essentially small things, but which I see as being
vital to the smooth running of the evening routine
with our daughters. The arguments are invariably in
the evening (One-to one).
I still get angry at my husband as he doesn’t
understand my PMS. However I think it’s the PMS
makes me feel this, as he does try and avoid the
issues at this time (one-to-one).
I keep things to myself more when I’m not pre-
menstrual and just get on with it and then I just
explode at my husband just before I’ve got my period
(one-to-one).
Yes, this is still the case, as our differences seem to
acute and I have no desire to be intimate. However, I
make a point of not making any major decisions
during this time, and I try to hold my tongue or
remain calm with my partner (couple).
All our fights–with my husband and I occur during my
PMS. I know it is an issue and I know during PMS
what is going on but I can’t control my feelings
despite that (couple).
I get depressed, withdrawn and keep things to
myself. The bothers husband, who can see I’m not
well but wouldn’t discuss with him (couple).
I am more likely to snap if something has been
building up for a while. I can be affected a lot more
by any problems. I can get a bit crazy and even feel
like I can’t cope to the point where I want to break-up
with my fiance
´. I also become quite depressed if my
sexual and emotional needs aren’t being met at a
time when I sometimes have increased desires. I
feel I can’t express my needs/feelings clearly and so
either say nothing or explode (couple).
We still fight, but when it happens it’s much less
intense (couple).
I feel Less loved (couple).
PMS is just a build-up of little things that have pissed
me off and it comes to the point where I’ve had
enough, and would really like to separate—but we
can’t really (couple).

I keep the survey that I am doing on the computer
desk so I do it every night, and I think he sort of has a
bit of a check of that, and a bit of a read and says
“Okay, this is it,” which is a good thing for him to see
instead of just not being nice about it. Like I think
he’s actually seen it is something (WLC).
A better relationship. A better me! (WLC).
I think about breaking up because I can’t stand
myself when I am like this and neither can he.
However–he has started to understand that it is
hormonal and doesn’t take my moodiness and
outbursts so seriously (WLC).
I think it has improved my relationship with my now
fiance
´. I have been more open when I am feeling
depressed and he gives me lots of hugs. I think I
have also identified patterns of negative behaviour
which occur PMS or not and that I need to work on
this not just PMS time but all the time (one to one).
I think my husband has become 100% more
understanding after reading the surveys and after
knowing how PMS made me feel. It was a real thing,
not me being “crazy” (WLC).
My partner and I are closer. We communicate more.
We enjoy activities together more often. He is more
supportive when I am going through PMS (one-to-
one).
Now that my partner has a better understanding of
what’s happening and I’m more aware of my actions,
we work together in trying to argue less and it seems
to be having a positive effect (one-to-one).
Most of our relationship issues related to my feelings
during PMS have now resolved. My partner is much
more supportive now that he knows what I’m going
through (couple).
I tell my partner that my period is coming and I am
having a few dark days. He understands now and
knows that I need a few more hugs (one-to-one).
We are now able to openly discuss our issues and
so they are now shared issues. Brought us closer
together (couple).
Issues would still come up but I was less likely to fly
off the handle and get crazy about it. I’d be more
likely to just say what I needed to say and let it go or
have a rational discussion about it instead of just
yelling or sulking or whatever (one-to-one).
My partner and I have benefitted so much from this
study. It has allowed me to be introspective without
being judged and learn more about myself, my PMS
and my relationship. My husband and I
communicate better and I haven’t had an angry
outburst with him since the study. Thanks!! (couple).
I find my partner is even more sympathetic towards
me in my PMS phase. The study has allowed him a
greater insight into how PMS affects me–so now
when I’m feeling angry/stressed/irritable, we talk
about PMS and he tries as best as he can to make
me feel better (couple).
Now my partner understands the depths of despair
PMS can create (ie that it is an actual thing ALOT
OF WOMEN GO THROUGH) he tries to be more
helpful and understanding in those times. I try to be
calmer and less needy, taking more time for myself
(couple).
Most of our relationship issues related to my feelings
during PMS have now resolved. My partner is much
more supportive now that he knows what I’m going
through (couple).

I can see that my mood changes
when premenstrual and I need to try
not to take this out on others. I still
get very angry and irritable but try to
remember that this is due to PMS
(WLC).
I feel very aware of my feelings and
try hard to be happy around family, or
tell them straight away if I’m feeling
bad, then they help me (WLC).
I found it really interesting to keep the
daily diaries, and reading through
them each week. I found it great to
talk to my partner about my PMT–to
find out his point of view on my
“week”! It has made me put strategies
in place to deal with my PMT (WLC).
I’m eating more healthily now but still
have cravings from time to time, but
I feel my body react better when
PMS (WLC).
Seeing patterns in behaviour and
mood changes–makes me aware
and I try to change or lessen moody
behaviour (WLC).
My husband and I have an
understanding where I let him know it
is “pmt” week (he can usually pick it!)
and he is very understanding! (WLC).
Becoming more aware of my
worsening moods has led me to be
able to talk myself out of those moods
and hence reduce my PMS
symptoms (WLC).
Only that I need to look after my
body throughout my cycle. So yoga–
2 times/week; Epsom salts baths– 1
every 1–2 weeks; eating more
protein at lunch; drinking less coffee
(one-to-one).
I’ve sort of seen a trend. I’ve sort of
learnt now what to expect, so it’s,
like it’s not so much unknown now.
So I think that’s how I’m dealing with
it a bit better as well (WLC).
Yes I feel that they understand me
now. I talked to everyone (friends
and family) and feel more
comfortable being myself and
socialising when premenstrual (one-
to-one).
I was made more aware of my PMS
and taught myself to manage it
(WLC).
I have changed to a much healthier
lifestyle so now when I look in the
mirror I see that progress I’ve made
rather than hating my body. I am
more accepting of monthly changes
and remind myself that it’s only for a
short time (one-to-one).
I used to think that others changed
at that time of the month. Now I can
recognise that it’s my perceptions
that change so I am careful not to
attack/criticise them (one-to-one).
I find it easy to say “I’m
premenstrual” and talk about how I’m
feeling about situations or events
compared to how I’m feeling when
I’m not premenstrual (one-to-one).
My life had improved across the
board. After years of horrid PMS and
feeling that no matter what I tried it
never consistently worked, I now feel
like I can cope, everyday and if I have
a bad day, I no longer feel out of
control or that it’s the end of the world,
such a relief! (one-to-one).
I feel I can now better deal with
being premenstrual. I take better
care of my body and listen to my
needs (one-to-one).
I try to remain very conscious that I
am more sensitive–not that they are
more annoying! (one-to-one).
I think I just communicate it more
effectively now. So I’m just better
able to say what I want without the
agitated emotional mannerisms. I’m
able to express just very clearly
whether I do want to be touched or I
don’t and he’s fine with whatever.
(one-to-one).
I’ve made time for myself each week.
Lived each day at a time to try avoid
being overwhelmed. Been less ‘hard
on myself’ Tried to stay away from
conflict where possible (one to one).
Yes, I know that if I eat the right food
with treats in moderation I can cope
better. Increasing my exercise
regime helps me to think more
clearly and react more positively to
every day challenges (couple).
I am learning to be more tolerant.
They are not the issue it’s the PMS
(one-to-one).
I now feel I can tell my partner what is
happening before I snap at him (or
take things out on him) (couple).
I can feel the signs–I’m touchy,
cranky, irrational,—so I try to take a
step back and start my breathing
techniques. I tell myself everything is
OK, just the way it is and remind
myself how important my family and
friends are to me (one to one)
I am not as extreme in my self-
criticism–I still experience bloating
and feeling not as good looking, but I
get pampering things done, wear
more comfortable clothes, accept
myself and tell myself it will change
shortly (couple).
I didn’t realise there was a pattern to
premenstrual night terrors until I was
keeping those journals and I went,
“Oh, my God” (couple).
I know and understand that by talking
to my partner things are not as grim
as I thought. I appreciate him more
(couple).
When I know I am in the PMS phase
of my cycle I constantly try to take
each thing that comes my way not
letting it make me more upset and
move into something calmer—ie do
some relaxing, interesting thing for
myself, ask for help from partner
(couple).
I feel more in-tune to the symptoms
of my body. I’m able to help myself
for a change. I’m able to respond
appropriately to the changes of my
body and more (couple).

RCT evaluation of relative efficacy of couple and one-to one CBT for PMDs

 Discussion
This study examined the relative efficacy of a couple CBT for PMDs in comparison with a one-
to-one CBT therapy, and a wait list control group. There were no pre-intervention differences
between the three groups, suggesting that they were comparable in meeting the criteria for
PMDs, experiencing high premenstrual distress, moderate-low levels of premenstrual coping,
and mild anxiety. Levels of depression, relationship adjustment and self-silencing were in the
normal range across groups. The finding of significant differences across time when the groups
are collapsed (ignoring the intervention group assignment), confirms previous reports [10, 13,
14] that taking part in an intervention for PMDs can reduce psychological premenstrual symp-
toms and premenstrual distress [15, 16, 18, 20, 72, 73]. We also found significant reductions in
depression, anxiety and self-silencing, and improvements in premenstrual coping, suggesting
that taking part in the intervention also had a positive impact on women’s psychological well-
being, her relationship communication strategies and on their ability to address premenstrual
change.
In a review of CBT interventions for PMDs, Lustyk and colleagues [10] report that existing
RCTs report a main effect of time, but not a statistically significant pre-post difference between
intervention groups [15, 16, 18, 19, 73]. Two meta-analyses [13, 14] reported a small non-sig-
nificant effect size for behavioural symptoms, and a medium effect size for mood, the magni-
tude of which was “not satisfactory” [14]. In contrast, we found that post-intervention women
in the two active CBT conditions reported significantly lower total premenstrual symptoms,
lower emotional reactivity/mood, lower premenstrual distress, and higher cognitive coping
than women in the wait list control. This suggests that that a CBT intervention for PMDs, in
both a one-to-one and couple modality, is effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms, pre-
menstrual distress and premenstrual emotional reactivity, as well as in improving premen-
strual coping, at post-intervention, with improvements maintained at follow-up. The absence
of post-intervention change in these variables in the wait list control group suggests that posi-
tive effects were due to the CBT intervention, rather than to the effects of time, or to taking
part in a PMDs intervention study. These findings also suggest that the addition of a woman’s
partner to the intervention is not having an effect on her premenstrual symptoms, premen-
strual distress or cognitive coping.

I am more aware of my criticism so I
have more space and am more
tolerant. I realise it is PMS thinking
(couple).
It’s not as bad as before, especially
since we have been working on our
communication during the last few
months. This means that there aren’t
so many pressing issues that get out
of hand at PMS time. We still have
some work to do though (couple).
I’m better able to cope with mood
changes during PMS (more aware,
can ask for help, reassurance,
positive thinking) (couple).
Yes–I feel that I can recognise
stressors and why I suddenly arc up.
I feel I have been given some tools
(couple).
I now analyse my thoughts, feelings,
and actions more, and I’m now able to
catch myself when my thoughts and
feelings are negative or not conducive
to my well-being. So I’m able to use
the strategies I learned in the study to
avoid having my feelings get on top of
me (couple).

 The finding of a main effect of time for depression, anxiety, self-silencing, physical premen-
strual symptoms and lack of energy/interest, but no post-intervention group differences
between groups in these variables, suggests that positive changes were associated with time,
individual differences between women, or taking part in the study. Self-monitoring has been
shown to be effective in the reduction of premenstrual symptomatology [74], due to increased
awareness of the relationship between moods and stressful situations across the menstrual
cycle [75], and giving the woman a sense of control, as well as helping her to educate her family
[4]. This was confirmed by the qualitative accounts of increased awareness and understanding
of premenstrual change post-intervention in the majority of participants in the wait-list con-
trol group, attributed to the self-monitoring of premenstrual mood prior to study entry, as
well as completion of pre-post surveys.
The qualitative data provides insight into the subjective experience and potential mecha-
nism of changes resulting from participation in the intervention study. Pre-intervention, the
majority of women reported feeling angry, irritable and oversensitive, which is central to clini-
cal definitions of PMDs [3], and has been reported in previous qualitative PMDs research [7,
76, 77]. There was a substantial reduction in such reports post-intervention, most markedly in
the two active conditions, suggesting a reduction in both intensity and frequency of negative
premenstrual emotional reactivity, which confirms the findings of the quantitative outcome
measures (PSTT). Increased awareness and understanding of premenstrual change post-inter-
vention was one explanation for these reductions in reactivity, reported by the majority of
women across conditions. This confirms previous reports of a reduction in self-pathologisa-
tion [48], as well as the use of anticipatory coping strategies [25], following the development of
awareness of patterns of premenstrual change. The majority of women in the two active condi-
tions, and a minority of women in the wait-list control, also reported increased communica-
tion and help-seeking, as well as the development of coping skills, associated with reductions
in premenstrual reactivity and distress. These skills are core ingredients of the CBT interven-
tion [18, 22], and demonstrate the mechanisms of its effectiveness, through changing patterns
of thinking, communication, coping and self-care.
Previous research has reported that women’s bodies are often experienced as ‘out of control’
during the premenstrual phase of the cycle [7], and can become the object of critical self-scru-
tiny [31, 38, 39], with the attribution of premenstrual changes to ‘raging hormones’ leading
women to take up the subject position of the ‘monstrous feminine’ [12]. In the present study,
the majority of women described embodied self-loathing and feelings of unattractiveness pre-
menstrually, primarily associated with perceptions of bloatedness and weight gain. Previous
research has reported that fluctuations in weight preoccupation across the menstrual cycle are
influenced primarily by post-ovulation emotional eating, rather than ovarian hormones [78].
However, the psycho-social meaning of feeling ‘fat’, associated with failing to live up to ideal-
ised constructions of feminine bodies as slim and in control [38, 79], is arguably central to
women’s dislike of the premenstrual body. These meanings can be challenged within a CBT
intervention, as reflected in the increased understanding and acceptance of embodied change
reported by the majority of women in the active conditions in the present study, associated
with marked decreases in negative conceptualisations of the premenstrual body. Women in
the two CBT conditions were also more likely to report engaging in self-care and coping strate-
gies to deal with embodied change premenstrually, most notably in the couple condition.
These findings suggest that self-perception of the body, rather than simple increase in weight
or bloating, are central to women’s feelings of negative premenstrual embodiment. There is a
dearth of research on women’s experiences of weight gain [78] or embodiment premenstrually;
previous studies examining the efficacy of CBT for PMDs have not examined women’s feelings
about their bodies as outcome variables. The strength and uniformity of women’s negative

 reports in the present study, and the positive changes post-intervention in the active condi-
tions, suggest that this is an area worthy of further scrutiny, as women’s negative perceptions
of their bodies are strongly associated with negative perceptions of the self [38, 80]. This sug-
gests that increased acceptance of the premenstrual body can positively impact on women’s
acceptance of the premenstrual self, and of premenstrual change.
Whilst previous research has reported that women who report PMDs also report higher lev-
els of relationship dissatisfaction or difficulties [26–31], this was not found in the present
study, where levels of relationship adjustment as measured by the DAS were in the normal
range. Equally, the finding that no change in relationship adjustment as measured by the DAS
was reported pre-post intervention, indicates that taking part in the study did not significantly
impact upon global relationship adjustment, within or between groups. However, in the qualita-
tive open-ended survey items women reported exacerbation of relationship tensions, or greater
irritation towards their partner premensturally, confirming previous research of altered percep-
tions of family and relationship stresses [24, 25], and negative evaluation of intimate relationships
[32, 33] in the premenstrual phase of the cycle. These relationship tensions were still present
post-intervention to the same or a greater extent for the wait-list and one-to-one conditions, in
contrast to a reduction in the couple condition. The finding that women in the couple and one-
to-one condition were more likely to report increased partner understanding and improved rela-
tionship post-intervention, with women in the couple condition reporting these improvements
to a greater degree, confirms previous reports that CBT interventions can have a positive effect
on relationships [18, 47]. However, it suggests that couple based CBT interventions can have a
greater positive impact upon perceptions of relationship context, reinforcing the plea for couples
therapy as an appropriate form of intervention for PMDs [45], and suggesting that partner
involvement can increase relational support [30].
This study had a number of strengths and limitations. The strengths were the use of daily
diary measures and a standardised screening instrument to establish PMDs criteria during the
recruitment phase; comparison of two active treatments with a wait list control within a rando-
mised controlled trial design; and the use of a range of qualitative and quantitative measures
allowing for the extent of change within and between groups to be evaluated with repeated
measures ANOVA, alongside women’s subjective experience of change. Whilst the rate of
attrition post-intervention was a limitation, resulting in a small sample size, attrition was lower
than that reported in previous CBT RCTs for PMDs [10], and the groups were of sufficient
size to allow for adequate statistical power to detect a significant difference between interven-
tion groups. A limitation was the absence of daily diary ratings throughout the study, which
would have allowed for measurement of ongoing change. This was not possible due to partici-
pant survey fatigue, with completion of daily diary ratings pre-randomisation reported to be
the only negative aspect of taking part in the study. Whilst partners were included in the cou-
ple condition, no evaluation of the perspectives of partners across conditions was included.
This would strengthen the design of future couple interventions for PMDs, allowing for evalu-
ation of the impact of intervention on partners, and possible changes in their perspective on
women’s PMDs. The majority of women who took part in this study were in heterosexual rela-
tionships. However, the one-to-one intervention used in the study has been found to be effica-
cious with women who are single and in lesbian relationships in previous research [56, 73],
suggesting it has efficacy beyond women in a heterosexual couple.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest whilst taking part in an intervention study for
PMDs can have a beneficial impact in reducing premenstrual symptoms and premenstrual

 distress, and in improving premenstrual coping, active CBT is more beneficial than a wait-list
control. Therefore, whilst daily monitoring may increase awareness of premenstrual change,
the active ingredients of a women-centred cognitive behavioural intervention are more effica-
cious in reducing symptomatology and increasing a woman’s sense of control of her premen-
strual moods, as well as her ability to cope with psychological and embodied premenstrual
change. This can have positive consequences for a woman’s perception of her relationship in
the premenstrual phase of the cycle, with couple-based interventions having a greater impact
in this regard.
Couple based CBT interventions may have a greater positive impact upon behavioural cop-
ing and perceptions of relationship context and support. This suggests that CBT should be
available for women reporting moderate-severe PMDs, with couple-based CBT offering addi-
tional benefits to a one-to-one modality. Whilst CBT may be more costly than bio-medical
treatments in the short term, as it requires more intensive clinician time and trained personnel
[10], the finding of a benefit over a relatively short time period suggests that long term costs
may be lower than the ongoing medical treatment that is recommended for severe PMDs [4].
Equally, a psychological intervention may be preferable to women who experience side effects
of medical treatments for PMDs and who withdraw from treatment as a result [4, 9]. Finally,
the demonstration of efficacy of a CBT intervention for PMDs confirms the viewpoint that
premenstrual distress is not simply a phenomenon located in women’s physiology, but that it
is closely tied to psycho-social factors [12, 39], including a woman’s perception of ‘PMS’ and
the premenstrual self, her relationship context, and her means of coping with embodied or
psychological change throughout the whole cycle. These findings support the argument that
CBT can have a preventative effect for PMDs [10], by preventing the premenstrual increases in
negative symptomatology or changing the way women come to relate to and report those
symptoms. The inclusion of a psycho-social model of premenstrual change in health education
for young women, and more broadly in education about adult women’s reproductive health,
may go some way to increasing understanding of women’s cyclical mood change, as well as
increasing women’s increasing agency and coping, thus reducing rates of premenstrual distress
in the community. This will have positive consequences for women and their families, as well
as for women’s social and economic functioning.
