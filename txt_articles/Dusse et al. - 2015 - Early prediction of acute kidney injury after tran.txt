Abstract
Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication following transcatheter aortic valve implantation
(TAVI) leading to increased mortality and morbidity. Urinary G1 cell cycle arrest proteins TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 have
recently been suggested as sensitive biomarkers for early detection of AKI in critically ill patients. However, the
precise role of urinary TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 in patients undergoing TAVI is unknown.
Methods: In a prospective observational trial, 40 patients undergoing TAVI (either transaortic or transapical) were
enrolled. Serial measurements of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 were performed in the early post interventional course. The
primary clinical endpoint was the occurrence of AKI stage 2/3 according to the KDIGO classification.
Results: Now we show, that ROC analyses of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] on day one after TAVI reveals a sensitivity of 100 %
and a specificity of 90 % for predicting AKI 2/3 (AUC 0.971, 95 % CI 0.914-1.0, SE 0.0299, p = 0.001, cut-off 1.03). In
contrast, preoperative and postoperative serum creatinine levels as well as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and
perioperative change in GFR did not show any association with the development of AKI. Furthermore, [TIMP-
2]*[IGFBP7] remained stable in patients with AKI ≤1, but its levels increased significantly as early as 24 h after TAVI
in patients who developed AKI 2/3 in the further course (4.77 ± 3.21 vs. 0.48 ± 0.68, p = 0.022). Mean patients age
was 81.2 ± 5.6 years, 16 patients were male (40.0 %). 35 patients underwent transapical and five patients transaortic
TAVI. 15 patients (37.5 %) developed any kind of AKI; eight patients (20 %) met the primary endpoint and seven
patients required renal replacement therapy (RRT) within 72 h after surgery.
Conclusion: Early elevation of urinary cell cycle arrest biomarkers after TAVI is associated with the development of
postoperative AKI. [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] provides an excellent diagnostic accuracy in the prediction of AKI that is
superior to that of serum creatinine.

 Background
Calcific aortic valve stenosis is the most common ac-
quired valvular heart disease with the highest prevalence
in the elderly. Despite the proven benefit of surgical
valve replacement, almost 50 % of patients with indica-
tion for surgical therapy do not undergo open interven-
tion mainly because of advanced age and significant
comorbidities, resulting in high perioperative mortality
[1]. Thus, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
has become a valid option in patients with severe aortic
stenosis who are i.e. considered ineligible for conven-
tional surgical aortic valve replacement [2].
Acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiac surgery is
well investigated with a reported incidence of 4–30 %, and
is associated with an increased mortality, which is propor-
tional to the severity of AKI [3, 4]. Recently, the relevance
of AKI after TAVI is increasingly recognized, as it seems to
be a common complication with an incidence ranging be-
tween 12 and 57 % [5, 6]. The high prevalence of preopera-
tive
chronic
kidney
impairment,
and
intravascular
hypovolemia as well as the use of contrast agents may con-
tribute to the high incidence of AKI after TAVI. AKI has
been shown to be an independent predictor of early mor-
tality after TAVI and, subsequently the postoperative im-
pairment of renal function has been defined as one of the
major outcomes by the Valve Academic Research Consor-
tium (VARC) [7]. Therefore, besides preoperative identifi-
cation of patients at high risk for AKI, early detection of
AKI seems to be reasonable. Although considered as a
standard tool in clinical routine, serum-creatinine is not
suitable for the early recognition of AKI due to inherent
methodological problems [8]. New biomarkers detecting
AKI, i.e. cystatin C or NGAL, showing superiority to cre-
atinine in different patient populations, have either not
been investigated in patients undergoing TAVI, or have
shown poor accuracy in this setting [9]. More important,
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IFGBP7) have
recently been suggested as promising tools for the early de-
tection of AKI in critically ill patients [10, 11]. Both pro-
teins are inducers of the G1 cell cycle arrest, considered a
key mechanism of AKI [12].
However, the utility of urinary cell cycle arrest bio-
markers for the prediction of AKI in patients following
TAVI is unknown. Therefore, it was the aim of the
present study to describe the postoperative course of
urinary [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] after TAVI and to determine
whether this biomarkers are useful in predicting the de-
velopment of AKI in this patient population.
Methods
Patients
The study was conducted according to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional
Ethic Review Board of the university Hospital Essen (ap-
proval date 01/09/2014, approval number: 13-5588-BO).
Patients were included following written informed consent
obtained from the patient or the patient’s guardian. We
used the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy
(STARD) statement for planning and conducting the study
and preparation of the manuscript [13]. Sixty three con-
secutive patients were screened for study inclusion and fi-
nally 40 patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis
who underwent transapical or transaortic TAVI at our insti-
tution were enrolled in this prospective study between
January 2014 and September 2014. Twenty three patients
were excluded as they refused to participate, incomplete
data or other reasons as depicted in Fig. 1.
The indication for TAVI was discussed for each patient in
an interdisciplinary consensus conference (“heart-team”) of
cardiologists and cardiac surgeons. The patient’s or physi-
cian’s preference alone was not considered adequate for
decision-making. Major outcomes were reported according
to the standardized Valve Academic Research Consortium
(VARC 2) criteria [7].
Surgical procedure
All procedures were performed under general anesthesia
with full hemodynamic monitoring in the hybrid laboratory
under fluoroscopy and 3-dimensional (3D) transesophageal
echo guidance (TEE). Hemodynamic monitoring included
a five-lead electrocardiography system to monitor heart
rate, rhythm and ST segments (leads II and V5), a pulse ox-
imetry probe, continuous measurement of arterial pressure
and blood sampling via the left radial artery, a triple-lumen
central venous catheter and a 7.5-French balloon-tipped
flow-directed pulmonary artery (PA) catheter (Becton
Dickinson, Tense Belgium, Belgium) via the right internal
jugular vein for continuous monitoring and measurement
of PA and central venous pressures, intermittent cardiac
output using thermodilution and measurement of blood
temperature.
Sedation was performed using a continuous intraven-
ous infusion of remifentanil (0.01–2 μg.kg − 1.min − 1)
and titrated injections of midazolam (0.01–0.02 mg.kg −
1) as required, combined with local anesthesia (up to
400 mg lidocaine) of the groin.
General
anesthesia
was
induced
with
fentanyl
(2 μg.kg − 1) and etomidate (0.3 mg.kg − 1), followed by
rocuronium (0.6 mg.kg − 1). Following tracheal intubation,
patients’ lungs were mechanically ventilated with oxygen
in air and anesthesia was maintained with inhaled isoflur-
ane in end-tidal concentrations of 0.4–0.6 %, with add-
itional intravenous fentanyl boluses of 2 μg.kg − 1.
Before the procedure, all patients received dual anti-
platelet therapy with oral aspirin (100 mg) and clopi-
dogrel
(300
mg),
and
antibiotic
prophylaxis
with
intravenous cefazolin (2 g). During the intervention,

 heparin (100–200 IU.kg − 1) was administered to ele-
vate the activated clotting time to more than 250 s.
After the procedure, all patients were transferred to
the intensive care unit.
When mean PA pressure exceeded 30 mmHg and was
associated with hemodynamic deterioration, nebulized
iloprost (20 μg), intravenous milrinone (50 μg.kg − 1
over 10 min as a loading dose, followed by a continuous
infusion of 0.4 μg.kg − 1.min − 1) or nitroglycerine (2–
5 mg.h − 1) were administered, at the discretion of the
responsible anesthetist. The transapical TAVI procedure
was performed as previously described [14]. The Ed-
wards SAPIEN™ aortic valve bioprosthesis was used in
13 patients whereas the Symetis™ valve was implanted in
15 patients.
Surgical approach for transaortic aortic valve implant-
ation was achieved by mini J sternotomy or mini right
thoracotomy in the 2nd intercostal space, respectively.
Detailed
technical
aspects
of
the
transaortic TAVI
procedure with the Symetis™ valve and the Ascendra II
delivery system have been described in detail previously
by Bapat et al. [15]. Device-specific medication consisted
of acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg once daily for life and clo-
pidogrel 75 mg daily for 6 months.
Biomarker measurements
Urine samples for biomarker analysis were obtained
within 4 h after surgery and then twice daily until
discharge from the intensive/intermediate care unit and
for a maximum of 4 days, whatever occurred first. Urin-
ary concentration of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 were mea-
sured
with
the
commercially
available
and
FDA-
approved
NephroCheck
Test
(Astute
Medical,
San
Diego, CA, USA) - a point-of-care biomarker-test devel-
oped to measure the product of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7
urine concentration. Values were displayed as (ng/ml)2/
1000. Serum creatinine was routinely measured prior
and 4 h after surgery and at least twice daily in the post-
operative period. Physicians in charge were blinded for
TIMP-2*IGFBP7 urine concentrations, while laboratory
investigators
were
blinded
for
clinical
outcomes.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation:
GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) = 175 × serum creatinine-1.154 ×
age-0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if African American).
Δ eGFR was defined as change of estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) at a specific time point from pre-
operative eGFR.
Endpoint definition
AKI stage was determined daily on the basis of diuresis
rate and serum creatinine concentration according to
the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes classifi-
cation (KDIGO) [16].
The primary endpoint was the new occurrence of
acute kidney injury stage 2 or 3 within 48 h after

 surgery. This observation is crucial as prior studies had
shown that AKI occurs within the first 24–72 h after
TAVI in the majority of cases.
Sample size calculation
The principle aim of this study was to investigate
whether there is a significant difference between the
mean [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] urine concentrations within
the first 24 h after surgery in patients developing
AKI 2/3 within 48 h after surgery compared to those
who did not. Based on recently published data on
[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] urine
concentrations in adults
undergoing
cardiac
surgery
with
cardiopulmonary
bypass, we aimed to detect a difference of one unit
in [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] urine concentrations with a
standard deviation of 0.8 units [17]. The known and
previously reported incidence of AKI following TAVI
ranges between 11.7 % and 57 % [5, 6]. Performing a
retrospective analysis of the last 30 patients undergoing
TAVI at our institution, the incidence of KDIGO AKI
stage 2 or 3 was 20 %, and this value was used for the
sample size calculation. With a given probability of type I
error (α) of 0.05, and a power (1 - β) of 0.8, the sample size
calculation revealed a required minimum size of 40 pa-
tients in total.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics
19 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous data were
expressed as mean ± SD; categorical data were expressed
as percentages. Comparisons between two groups were
carried out using the unpaired Student’s t-test for nor-
mally distributed data and the Mann–Whitney U test for
abnormally distributed data. Multiple groups were com-
pared by means of one-way ANOVA. Univariate analysis
was performed on the quantitative variables using the
Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney test and on the quali-
tative variables using the Chi2 test or Fisher’s exact test.
Variables with p < 0.05 in the univariate analysis were in-
cluded in a logistic regression model to determine the
independent factors associated with death. Model cali-
bration was tested using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
Statistical significance was assumed for a p-value <0.05.
To measure the sensitivity and specificity of [TIMP
2]*[IGFBP7] urine concentrations at different cut-off values,
a conventional receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve was generated. The optimal cut-off level was
defined by the highest Youden index (J = sensitivity +
specificity – 1).
Results
Patients’ characteristics
Forty patients were included in this study (see Fig. 1). The
procedural success rate was 100 %; no conversion to open
aortic valve replacement (AVR) had to be done. The mean
age of the patients was 81.2 ± 5.6 years, 16 patients were
male (40.0 %). 35 patients underwent transapical, and five
patients transaortic TAVI with equal distribution in study
groups. AKI of any stage occurred in 15 patients (37.5 %):
KDIGO AKI 1 was classified in seven patients (17.5 %)
and KDIGO AKI 2 in two patients (5 %). Six patients suf-
fered from KDIGO AKI 3 (15 %) and seven patients re-
quired RRT in the postoperative course (17.5 %).
The pre-procedural characteristics of patients under-
going TAVI suffering from AKI stage 2 or 3 according to
KDIGO compared to those without significant renal im-
pairment (KDIGO 0 or 1) are summarized in Table 1.
Baseline demographics including age, gender, proportion
of relevant comorbidities and technical details of sur-
gery, e.g. length of surgery or applied contrast agent
(AKI 2/3: [ml] 102.1 ± 35.8 vs. AKI 0/1: 131.0 ± 44.7, p =
n.s.) were comparable between both groups. Incidence
of preoperative atrial fibrillation was higher in patients
suffering from postoperative KDIGO AKI 2/3. The
severity of illness on the day of surgery assessed by
Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) was higher in
the group of patients with KDIGO AKI 2/3 (AKI 2/3:
33.8 ± 9.7 vs. AKI 0/1: 27.0 ± 6.7, p = 0.034). ICU stay
tended to be longer in patients with moderate to severe
renal impairment without reaching statistical signifi-
cance. One patient in each study group died during the
hospital stay (p = n.s.).
The incidence of sepsis was higher in the group of pa-
tients with AKI 2/3 (2/8 (25 %) vs. 0/32 (0 %), p = 0.03).
Preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
and serum creatinine were not associated with the devel-
opment of postoperative AKI 2/3 (preoperative eGFR:
AKI 2/3 65.6 ± 15.9 vs. AKI 0/1 65.0 ± 18.1 ml/kg/
1.73 m2; preoperative serum creatinine: AKI 2/3 1.18 ±
0.26 vs. AKI 0/1 1.12 ± 0.24 mg/dl).
Perioperative course of biomarkers
In patients developing AKI 2/3 within the next 48 h,
[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] increased significantly already on
the 1st postoperative day (4.62 ± 3.14 (ng/ml)2/1000)
followed by a decline to 3.40 ± 1.86 on postoperative day
(POD) 2. In the further course [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] in-
creased to a maximum of 27.09 ± 36.74 (ng/ml)2/1000
on the 4th day.
No significant rise in urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] urine
concentration was observed in patients with KDIGO
AKI 0/1 at any time with a maximum value on the 3th
postoperative day of 1.75 ± 3.63 indicating that surgical
intervention with TAVI per se has no influence on the
investigated G1 cell cycle arrest biomarkers.
In patients with KDIGO AKI 0/1, serum creatinine as
well as eGFR remained stable at all times with no signifi-
cant undulations over time. In contrast, elevated serum

 creatinine levels could be observed on POD 2 with a
maximum
of
1.64 ± 0.99
mg/dl.
Accordingly,
eGFR
showed a significant fall on POD 2 with 38.86 ±
23.79 ml/min/1.73 m2. Furthermore, the postoperative
courses
of
serum
creatinine,
eGFR
and
urinary
[TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] urine concentrations for patients
with AKI stage 2/3 and for those with no or mild AKI
(KDIGO stage 0–1) are displayed in Fig. 2.
Distribution of biomarkers and eGFR measured on
POD 1 following TAVI according to the KDIGO classifi-
cation is shown in Fig. 3. [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] urine con-
centrations in patients with KDIGO AKI 3 (median 6.49,
range 1.06–8.66) were significantly higher than in pa-
tients with KDIGO AKI 0 (median 0.21, range 0.06–
3.03) or KDIGO AKI 1 (median 0.35, range 0.06–0.57).
Accordingly, patients with AKI 2 or 3 showed signifi-
cantly higher [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] urine concentrations
than patients with AKI 0–1 (median 5.11, range 1.06–
8.66 vs. 0.23, range 0.06–3.03, p < 0.05).
In contrast, neither serum creatinine concentrations nor
eGFR differ significantly in subgroups stratified by KDIGO.
Prediction of AKI with biomarkers
Using ROC analyses, serum creatinine concentrations mea-
sured preoperatively (AUC 0.458, 95 % CI 0.226–0.691,
SE 0.119, p = 0.720) as well as 4 h after intervention
(AUC 0.500, 95 % CI 0.186–0.814, SE 0.160, p = 1.00)
turned out to be a bad predictor for AKI 2/3. The same
applies for eGFR measured before surgery as well as
the change of eGFR from preoperative to 4 h after
intervention.
In contrast, diagnostic accuracy for [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7]
4 h after TAVI was better with a sensitivity of 75 % and a
specificity of 55.6 % when using a cut-off value of 0.185
(AUC 0.646, 95 % CI 0.375–0.916, SE 0.138, p = 0.312).
[TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] measured on day one after TAVI
showed a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity for

 predicting KDIGO AKI 2/3 (AUC 0.971, 95 % CI 0.914–
1.000, SE 0.0299, p = 0.001, cut off 1.03). Compared to
[TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] urine concentrations, serum creatin-
ine concentrations on day one after surgery as well as the
change in GFR from preoperative baseline to POD 1
yielded low predictive capacities for AKI 2/3 (serum cre-
atinine: AUC 0.629, 95 % CI 0.438–0.870, SE 0.11, p =
0.189, cut off 1.37 mg/dl, sensitivity 50 %, specificity
82.1 %; Δ GFR: AUC 0.586, 95 % CI 0.359–0.944, SE
0.149, p = 0.196, cut off 7 ml/min/1.73 m2, sensitivity
62.5 %, specificity 82.1 %;).
At a cut-off of 0.91, the maximum value of [TIMP 2]
*[IGFBP7] urine concentrations within 24 h after inter-
vention showed a 87.5 % sensitivity and a 82.8 % specifi-
city for detecting patients who develop KDIGO AKI 2/3
(AUC 0.869, SE 0.080, 95 % CI 0.721–1.0, p = 0.002).
The diagnostic accuracy for [TIMP 2] *[IGFBP7] was
better than for maximum serum creatinine concentra-
tions within the first 24 h after intervention with a sensi-
tivity of 75.0 % and a specificity of 55.2 % for a cut-off-
value 1.160 (AUC 0.655, SE 0.108, p = 0.184, 95 % CI

SE 0.142, 95%CI 0.338–0.983, p = 0.326). The concord-
ant ROC curves are illustrated in Fig. 4.
In addition, the maximum value of [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7]
within 24 h after intervention showed a sensitivity 100 %
and a specificity of 80.0 % for detecting patients with
need for renal replacement within the next 72 h (AUC
0.919, SE 0.048, 05 % CI 0.824–1.0, p = 0.001). Apply-
ing previously published cut-off points (0.3 and 2.0
(ng/ml)2/1000) showed either low sensitivity or low
specificity (Table 2).
Discussion
In our prospective observational trial of 40 patients
undergoing transapical or transaortic TAVI the elevation
of urinary [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] concentrations within
24 h after surgery is associated with the onset of postop-
erative AKI within the next 72 h. [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7]
urine concentrations show an excellent diagnostic accur-
acy for the prediction of severe AKI requiring RRT. In
contrast, neither serum creatinine concentrations (pre-
operative, postoperative) nor changes of GFR were able
to predict the occurrence of AKI reliably. Our results

 clearly demonstrate that [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] can be used
to identify patients at high risk for AKI.
Incidence, mechanisms and outcome of renal impair-
ment after TAVI are not well investigated. According to
a reported probability of 12 to 57 % for the development
of an AKI after TAVI, the risk of renal impairment is
very high, despite avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass
and major surgical trauma occurring during open aortic
valve replacement [5, 6]. Intraprocedural episodes of
hypotension, intraoperative emboli, occurrence of para-
valvular aortic regurgitation with a reduction in diastolic
renal blood flow and the use of contrast agents are some
of the factors potentially contributing to this high inci-
dence of AKI after TAVI. A recent meta-analysis includ-
ing 25 studies with a total of 8874 patients identified
KDIGO AKI ≥2 as the strongest predictor for 30-d-
mortality (OR 18.0, 95 % CI 6.3 to 52) whereas KDIGO
AKI 3 was an important determinant of midterm mor-
tality after TAVI [18].
The current assessment of renal function by means of
serum creatinine or urine output has a number of major
limitations: creatinine is insensitive to small but signifi-
cant declines in GFR, and there is regularly a delay be-
tween more extensive kidney injury and the subsequent

 rise of serum creatinine. In addition, numerous non-
renal factors such as age, gender, muscle mass or liver
disorders may be associated with decreased creatinine
production or the dilution of serum creatinine concen-
trations [8]. New biomarkers suggested for an accurate
and earlier detection of AKI are various, including cysta-
tin C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL),
kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), liver-type fatty acid
binding protein (L-FABP), etc. Among these, only cysta-
tin C and NGAL seem to be reliable in selected patient
cohorts and automated assay methods are commercially
available.
However, in a recently published study, urinary NGAL
levels in 34 consecutive patients measured 4 h after

 transfemoral TAVI were comparable between patients
with AKI and those without (41.6 ± 35.7 vs. 45.3 ±
38.7 ng/mL, p = 0.57) [19]. In a prospective study enrol-
ling 68 consecutive patients with symptomatic severe
aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral or transapical
TAVI, cystatin C levels in patients developing AKI were
comparable to those with normal postoperative renal
function within the first two postoperative days. Thus,
Cystatin C does not represent a stand-alone biomarker
for the early detection of AKI after TAVI [9]. Other au-
thors confirmed these findings and could not detect any
prognostic impact of cystatin C in this patient popula-
tion [20]. Consequently, due to very limited evidence in
the TAVI population and inconsistent results from re-
cently published studies, the prognostic impact of NGAL
and Cystatin C in this clinical setting is more than dis-
putable [9, 19]. Currently there is still no valid bio-
marker available for the early and reliable detection of
AKI in critically ill patients in general and in the TAVI
population in particular. Thus measurement of [TIMP
2]*[IGFBP7] urine concentrations as early as 24 h fol-
lowing intervention might be a promising approach even
in patients undergoing minimal invasive TAVI proce-
dures, as we have shown in our study.
In detail, recently a total of 340 potential biomarkers
had been investigated in the urine and serum for the pre-
diction of AKI of 744 adult critically ill patients [21]. The
two cell cycle arrest proteins TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 were
identified to have better diagnostic accuracy than any
other biomarker. Furthermore, in the SAPPHIRE study,
TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 exhibited an AUC of 0.76 and 0.79
AUC for the development of AKI (KDIGO stage 2 or 3)
within 12 h, respectively. The combination of both bio-
markers increased the AUC to 0.80 [21]. The prospective
OPAL study enrolling 154 critically ill adults from six sites
in the USA used two clinical cut-off values for urinary
[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]
based
on
the
data
from
the
SAPPHIRE cohort: A low (0.3) and a high (2.0) cut-off
value were chosen to achieve either a high sensitivity or a
high specificity to identify patients who are at high risk for
AKI, respectively [10]. For the 0.3 cut-off, sensitivity was
89 % and specificity of 53 %. For 2.0, sensitivity was 42 %
and specificity 95 %. The prospective multicenter TOPAZ
study enrolled a heterogeneous population of 420 patients
admitted to the ICU to validate the utility of [TIMP-
2]*[IGFBP7] at a high-sensitivity pre-specified cut-off
greater than 0.3 for the AKI defined as KDIGO stage 2 or
3 within 12 h [11]. Secondary analysis was performed for a
cut-off value of 2.0. Sensitivity of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] was
92 % with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.18. Patients with
urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] greater than 0.3 had seven
times the risk for AKI compared to those critically ill pa-
tients with a test result below 0.3.
In summary, we now show that the combination of the
two biomarkers TIMP2 and IGFBP7 seems to be highly
predictive to identify patients who will develop moderate
to severe AKI in the next 12–24 h following TAVI.
Both biomarkers - TIMP-2 and IGFBP7- are inducers
of G1 cell-cycle arrest, considered as a key mechanism
of AKI [12]. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
(TIMPs) are endogenous inhibitors of matrix metallo-
proteinases (MMPs), a large family of zinc endopepti-
dases having important roles in extracellular matrix
(ECM) remodeling. Four TIMPs (TIMP1–4) have been
identified as inhibitors of 26 MMPs.
IGFBP-7 is a secreted glycoprotein that binds to insu-
lin growth factors. According to the Human Protein
Atlas, IGFBP-7 is expressed in the glomeruli and tubules
of healthy humans. IGFBP-7 plays a pivotal role in G1
cell-cycle arrest. Renal tubular cells can enter a short
period of G1 cell-cycle arrest following injury from ex-
perimental sepsis or ischemia. This process may prevent
cells from dividing when DNA is damaged and may rep-
resent an early response to renal injury [12].

 Studies investigating the role of [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] in
the prediction of AKI and defining cut-off values in car-
diovascular patient populations are rare and currently
restricted to adult and pediatric open cardiac surgery
[17]. Meersch et al. were able to show that the max-
imum [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] concentration within the first
24 h after cardiac surgery has a sensitivity of 0.92 and
specificity of 0.81 at a cut-off value of 0.50 for the pre-
diction of AKI, performing better than creatinine or
NGAL [22] in 50 patients. Moreover, the decline in urin-
ary [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] concentrations was a strong pre-
dictor for renal recovery before hospital discharge. The
same working group investigated the utility of [TIMP
2]*[IGFBP7] in 51 children undergoing open cardiac sur-
gery showing significantly higher [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7]
levels 4 h after surgery in comparison to children who
did not develop AKI. [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] measured 4 h
after intervention demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.83 with
a specificity of 0.77 (AUC 0.85, cut-off value 0.70) [17].
As etiologies and pathophysiology of AKI differ sub-
stantially between patient populations, cut-off values
from septic or medical patients might not be applicable
to patients undergoing TAVI. Accordingly, we defined
cut-off values for interventional TAVI procedures in our
study which were different from recently published stud-
ies: In the Discovery, Sapphire and Opal study, best cut-
off values for discrimination of patients with high risk
for developing AKI in the future was 0.3 (ng/ml)2/1000,
whereas Meersch set the value of 0.5 (ng/ml)2/1000 for
the adult and 0.70 (ng/ml)2/1000 for the pediatric car-
diothoracic population.
In contrast to serum creatinine, the postoperative
course of the investigated cell cycle arrest biomarkers
showed a characteristic biphasic pattern: serum creatin-
ine rises slowly being significantly higher in the AKI
group on postoperative day 2, still rising on POD 3 and
staying stable on POD 4. Unlike, [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7]
rises as early as 24 h after surgery and then already falls
on POD 2. In the further course [TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] in-
creases again on POD 3 and 4.
TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 have been implicated in the G1
cell-cycle arrest phase representing the earliest point of
cellular stress. As TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 increase in re-
sponse to a wide variety of insults (inflammation, oxidative
stress, drugs and toxins) very fast, this biphasic course
may implicate that besides surgery with application of con-
trast agent being responsible for the first peak of the graph,
further insults, e.g. hemodynamic disturbances, may have
led to the second peak on POD 3 whereas serum creatin-
ine is not able to detect and discriminate these multi hits
to the kidney remaining high from POD 1 to POD 3.
The costs for the NephroCheck Test are approximately
35 €. This is significantly higher than the costs for the gold
standard – serum creatinine. However, a recently published
study could show that the presence of AKI in 891 critically
ill patients with ARDS, MI and sepsis resulted in additional
costs of 2,019,120.42 € at the University Hospital of Re-
gensburg in 2013 translating into additional costs of 2266
€ per patient [23]. The authors conclude that early recogni-
tion of patients at risk may be one important step to de-
crease the incidence and severity of AKI and save costs for
the national healthcare system. Therefore, it might be hy-
pothesized that the higher costs for the measurement of
the urinary G1 cell cycle arrest biomarkers might be at
least partly be compensated by the decreased therapy costs
for these patients.
Difficulties in prediction and early identification of
AKI have hindered the ability to develop preventive and
therapeutic interventions. If recognized earlier, nephro-
protective measures could be considered to reduce ex-
posure
to
renal
insults
and
potentially
avoid
the
development of higher stage AKI. Although there are no
specific therapies for AKI, the optimization of fluid bal-
ance and hemodynamics as well as a medication review
with avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs can reduce the inci-
dence and severity of AKI and improve long-term out-
comes [24]. In addition, earlier commencement of RRT
in critically ill patients with incipient AKI may be benefi-
cial with a reduction of mortality [25].
Limitations
There were some limitations to our study. Due to the rela-
tively small sample size, the predicted cut-off values for
[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentrations in the urine may be dif-
ferent from those obtained in other populations. In addition,
the number of patients with AKI I small and consecutively
the AUC 95 % CIs are very broad. Thus, interpretation of
the data should be performed with caution. In the present
study, we only investigated the commercially available test
kit measuring the product of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]. There-
fore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the prognostic
properties of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 alone in comparison to
their multiplication. Diuresis is difficult to interpret in early
postoperative care after cardiac surgery, as decreased urinary
output depends on the amount of intravenous fluid adminis-
tered as well as the application of a diuretic to avoid volume
overload in patients with restricted cardiac function. This
may blur the clinical effect of AKI.
Conclusion
[TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] values of 1.0 or greater on day one
after interventional TAVI identify patients at high risk
for
developing
KDIGO
AKI
stage
2/3.
Therefore,
[TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] can be considered a useful tool in
the early prediction of AKI in patients after TAVI. How-
ever, future studies are mandatory to verify whether
[TIMP 2]*[IGFBP7] guided therapy can prevent severe
AKI and reduce morbidity and mortality.
