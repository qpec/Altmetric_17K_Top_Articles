OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence of dementia in
the absence of a reported dementia diagnosis and whether
potentially unsafe activities and living conditions vary as a
function of dementia diagnosis status in a nationally repre-
sentative sample of older adults.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: Medicare
beneficiaries
aged
65
and
older enrolled in the National Health and Aging Trends
Study (N = 7,609).
MEASUREMENTS: Participants were classified into four
groups based on self-report of dementia diagnosis, proxy
screening interview, and cognitive testing: probable demen-
tia with reported dementia diagnosis (n = 457), probable
dementia without reported dementia diagnosis (n = 581),
possible dementia (n = 996), or no dementia (n = 5,575).
Potentially unsafe activities (driving, preparing hot meals,
managing finances or medications, attending doctor visits
alone) and living conditions (falls, living alone, and unmet
needs) were examined according to dementia status sub-
groups in stratified analyses and multivariate models,
adjusting for sociodemographic factors, medical comor-
bidities, and physical capacity.
RESULTS: The prevalence of driving (22.9%), preparing
hot meals (31.0%), managing finances (21.9%), managing
medications (36.6%), and attending doctor visits alone
(20.6%) was lowest in persons with probable dementia;
however, but in persons with probable dementia, the
covariate-adjusted rates of driving, preparing hot meals,
managing finances, managing medications, and attending
doctor visits alone were significantly higher in those with-
out
reported
dementia
diagnosis
than
in
those
with
reported diagnosis (all odds ratios ≥2.00, all P < .01).
CONCLUSION: Older
adults
with
probable
dementia
who are not aware of a dementia diagnosis are more likely
to report engaging in potentially unsafe behaviors. Under-
standing the prevalence of potentially unsafe activities and
living conditions can help clinicians focus safety screening
and counseling in older adults with diagnosed or suspected
dementia. J Am Geriatr Soc 64:1223–1232, 2016.
Key words: safety; dementia; observational study
A
n estimated 5 million people in the United States have
dementia, and the prevalence is projected to nearly tri-
ple by 2050.1 Dementia can affect any cognitive domain,
including executive function, insight, and judgment.2,3
Over time, cognitive decline leads to increasing functional
impairment and difficulty with instrumental activities of
daily living (IADLs) and activities of daily living (ADLs).4,5
The earliest functional impairments occur in higher-level
IADLs such as driving, cooking, and managing finances or
medications.5 In the context of impaired insight and judg-
ment, disabilities in these IADLs may expose persons with
dementia (PWDs) to potential harm, including risk of
physical injury to self or others, property loss or damage,
and financial exploitation.6,7 Other conditions such as fre-
quent falls, unmet needs or neglect, and living alone may
also pose a risk of harm.6,8–11 Guidelines for dementia
management recognize these risks and include a compre-
hensive assessment of needs and safety evaluation as
important aspects of dementia care.12,13 Given that demen-
tia is frequently unrecognized,14,15 safety is often insuffi-
ciently addressed.16 Even in diagnosed dementia, quality of
care, which includes safety assessment and counseling, is
often inconsistent and reactive.12,17,18
Dementia-related safety concerns include falls, medica-
tion management, financial management, cooking, access
to firearms, being left alone, inability to respond to crises,
driving, and abuse or neglect.7,12,19,20 Many studies exam-
ine these safety concerns in the framework of functional
decline,4,5,16 focusing on activities PWDs cannot perform

 independently rather than potentially risky activities PWDs
continue
to
perform
despite
risk
of
adverse
conse-
quences.6,10,21–24 Existing studies on safety in dementia
largely focus on a single concern, such as driving, falls,
living
alone,
or
unmet
needs,6,8,10,21,23,25–28
whereas
activities such as cooking and medication management
have been less studied. Most studies have also been
conducted in small samples or dementia-specific popula-
tions.6–8,10,21,25–27,29 There are no data on the prevalence
of potentially unsafe activities and living conditions in
PWDs from a nationally representative sample.
Understanding the prevalence of potentially unsafe
activities and living conditions in PWDs and characteristics
of PWDs engaging in these activities is essential to guide
and prioritize safety screening and interventions. Under-
standing whether potentially unsafe activities and living
conditions vary according to whether PWDs and their fam-
ilies are aware of the diagnosis of dementia may also have
implications for the screening and diagnosis of dementia.
The objectives of the current study were to quantify the
prevalence of dementia without report of dementia diagno-
sis, determine rates of potentially unsafe activities and liv-
ing conditions in older adults with cognitive impairment,
and examine the association between dementia status and
potentially unsafe activities and living conditions.
METHODS
Participants and Study Design
The National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) is
an ongoing observational study of a nationally representa-
tive cohort of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older in
the United States.30 In-person interviews were conducted
with older adult participants or proxy respondents if par-
ticipants were unable to respond. If the participant could
respond with help, an assistant could help answer factual
questions. A sample of 8,245 participants was enrolled in
2011, with an overall 71% response rate. The present
cross-sectional analyses excluded individuals who were res-
idents of a nursing home (n = 468) or were missing base-
line dementia classification data (n = 168), resulting in an
analytical sample of 7,609 study participants living in the
community or other residential care setting (assisted living,
continuing care retirement community, group home). A
proxy responded for 583 participants, and 2,017 self-
respondents received help from an assistant during the
interview.
Dementia Status
Methods to identify cognitive impairment in NHATS have
been developed and validated.31 NHATS dementia classifi-
cation is based on three types of information: self- or
proxy report of being told by a doctor that the participant
has dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, a score indicating
probable dementia on the validated AD8 Dementia Screen-
ing Interview32,33 administered to proxy respondents, and
cognitive test results. Cognitive testing in NHATS consists
of evaluating memory (immediate and delayed 10-word
recall), orientation (date, month, year, day of the week,
President and Vice President), and executive function
(clock drawing test). Report of diagnosis and AD8 scores
were used for dementia classification for participants with
proxy respondents who did not allow administration of
cognitive test items (n = 284).
Any participant with report of dementia diagnosis
was classified as having probable dementia. In sample per-
sons with a proxy respondent, persons without a reported
diagnosis for whom AD8 Dementia Screening Interview
responses met criteria for dementia (score ≥2/8) were also
classified as having probable dementia. For the remaining
participants (self-respondents without reported diagnosis
and 79 persons with proxy respondents who had no
reported diagnosis, did not meet AD8 criteria, and com-
pleted cognitive tests), dementia categorization was based
on performance on cognitive tests. Cognitive impairment
in each of the three domains tested was defined as a score
at or below 1.5 standard deviations from the mean for
self-respondents, a cutpoint commonly used to classify
cognitive impairment.34 Resulting cutpoints were 3 for
memory (score 0–20), 3 for orientation (score 0–8), and 1
for executive function (score 0–5). Participants were clas-
sified as having probable dementia if they met criteria for
impairment in at least two cognitive domains and as hav-
ing possible dementia if they had impairment in one cog-
nitive
domain.31
For
participants
classified
as
having
probable dementia, individuals were further classified as
having probable dementia with or without reported physi-
cian diagnosis. Participants not meeting criteria for possi-
ble or probable dementia were classified as having no
dementia.
Potentially Unsafe Activities and Living Conditions
The potentially unsafe activities and living conditions
examined in this study were informed by previous studies
and
guidelines7,12,13,20
and
based
on
self-
or
proxy
reported activities and living conditions over the last
month. Caregiving was defined as providing assistance for
a person who could not care for him or herself. Driving
included any driving in the past month. Participants were
classified as preparing hot meals, handling finances, or
managing medications if they always or sometimes made
hot meals; handled bills, banking, or complex money mat-
ters; or kept track of medications by themselves. Partici-
pants who reported seeing their regular doctor in the last
year were asked whether another person accompanied
them or they went alone to physician visits.
Multiple falls was defined as more than one fall, slip,
or trip in which the participant lost balance and landed on
the ground in the past year. Living alone indicates there
were no other individuals reported as living in the partici-
pant’s household. Drawing from prior work,35 unmet
ADL needs was defined based on participant reports that
they ever went without eating, bathing, dressing, or toilet-
ing because of difficulty performing the task or lack of
help. Unmet IADL needs represent whether the participant
ever went without laundry, grocery, hot meals, or paying
bills or made a mistake with medications. Unmet in-home
mobility needs refer to not going somewhere within the
home or building or staying in bed, and unmet outside
mobility needs refer to staying in the home or building,
because of difficulty or lack of help. Unmet ADL, IADL,

 and mobility needs were examined separately, as in a prior
study,36 and as an aggregated measure of any unmet need.
In addition to assessing engagement in potentially
unsafe activities and living conditions, NHATS also assesses
difficulty with activities in the past month. Participants who
performed the following activities themselves were asked
how much difficulty (none, a little, some, a lot) they had:
preparing hot meals, handling finances, managing medica-
tions, leaving the home to go outside, getting around inside
the home, getting out of bed, laundry, shopping, eating,
bathing, toileting, and dressing. Difficulty was classified
dichotomously for each activity (no vs any difficulty). Par-
ticipants who drive reported whether they avoided driving
at night, alone, on busy roads or highways, or in bad
weather. Participants who avoided at least one driving situ-
ation were classified as having difficulty.
Covariates
Comprehensive questions regarding sociodemographic fac-
tors, health status and medical conditions, and physical
capacity were included in NHATS. Respondents provided
information on participant age, sex, race, marital status,
number of living children, education, income, and residence
type (private residence, retirement community, assisted liv-
ing, continuing care retirement community, group home).
They were asked to rate overall health status (poor, fair,
good, very good, excellent) and report chronic medical con-
ditions (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease,
hypertension, arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, lung
disease, stroke, cancer). Subjective physical impairment was
assessed through report of hearing or vision impairment and
other physical symptoms that limit activity such as pain,
shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness. Objective physical
capacity was measured using the Short Physical Performance
Battery (SPPB),37 which included balance stand, walking
speed, and chair stand, with scores ranging from 0 to 12. Par-
ticipants unable or ineligible to complete the SPPB were given
a score of 0. Higher scores indicate better physical capacity.
Statistical Analysis
Analytical sampling weights accounting for the complex
sampling strategy of NHATS and potential nonresponse
bias are available for NHATS.38 All inferential analyses
were conducted using weighted data. Inferences were
based on statistical significance tests using an alpha of .05.
The chi-square statistic was used to compare proportions
and simple linear regression to compare means between
dementia status groups for baseline characteristics. The
adjusted Wald test was used to examine cognitive test per-
formance according to dementia status, with weighted
group mean scores compared with the mean score for the
reference group (probable dementia with reported demen-
tia diagnosis). The prevalence and reported difficulty of
each potentially unsafe activity and living condition for
participants was determined according to dementia status
using cross-tabulation, with statistically significant differ-
ences evaluated using the chi-square statistic.
Multinomial logistic regression models were used to
examine the prevalence of each potentially unsafe activity
and living condition according to dementia status. Odds
ratios (ORs) were calculated for participants with probable
dementia without reported dementia diagnosis, possible
dementia, and no dementia using the group classified as
having probable dementia with reported diagnosis as the
reference group. This model provided pairwise compar-
isons of each group with the diagnosed dementia group.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the
adjusted OR of each potentially unsafe activity and living
condition after controlling for covariates.
To explore potential effects of inaccurate self-report in
dementia, sensitivity analyses of the prevalence and logistic
regression models were performed. Participants with prob-
able
dementia
who
responded
independently
(without
proxy or assistant) and rated their memory as very good
or excellent on a 5-point Likert scale (n = 51) were
excluded because self-report may be particularly unreliable
in this subgroup.39 In a separate analysis, all participants
with probable dementia who responded independently
were excluded. (n = 217).
RESULTS
Description of Participants
Descriptive, unweighted baseline characteristics of partici-
pants are displayed according to dementia status in Table 1.
Of 1,038 participants classified as having probable dementia,
457 (44%) reported a dementia diagnosis (58.9% proxy,
41.1% self-report), and 581 (56%) did not (31.7% proxy,
68.3% self-report); 8.8% of the probable dementia group
with a reported diagnosis and 30.5% without a reported
diagnosis, 60.6% with possible dementia, and 73.5% with
no dementia responded independently (without proxy or
assistant). Inferential analyses based on weighted data indi-
cated statistically significant differences on all baseline
sociodemographic and health measures according to demen-
tia status (all P < .01), with the exception of lung disease and
cancer. Participants with probable or possible dementia com-
pared to those with no dementia were more likely to be older,
nonwhite, not married (widowed or never married), and less
educated; have lower income; live in a residential care set-
ting; and rate their health as fair or poor. Participants with
probable dementia were more likely to be female. The group
with probable dementia and a reported dementia diagnosis
were more likely to have subjective physical impairments
related to hearing, vision, pain, and other physical symp-
toms. SPPB scores were lowest in participants with probable
dementia with and without reported dementia diagnosis.
Table 2 displays group differences in cognitive testing.
On average, participants classified as having probable
dementia without reported dementia diagnosis who com-
pleted cognitive tests (n = 511) scored slightly worse on
tests of memory and executive function than participants
with reported diagnosis who completed cognitive tests
(n = 319). Orientation scores were similar between these
two groups.

 according to dementia status. Participants with probable
dementia were less likely than those with possible or no
dementia to report providing care to another person
(5.8%), driving (22.9%), preparing hot meals (31%), han-
dling finances (21.9%), managing medications (36.6%),
and attending physician visits alone (20.6%). Participants
with probable dementia who did not report a dementia
diagnosis were more likely than those who reported a
diagnosis to report engagement in all potentially unsafe
activities.
Participants classified as having probable dementia
with a reported diagnosis had the highest rates of multi-
ple falls and unmet IADL, ADL, and mobility needs.
Although rates were lower in persons who had probable
dementia without a reported diagnosis, they had a greater
prevalence of falls and unmet ADL and mobility needs
than those with possible or no dementia. The prevalence
of living alone was similar across groups. Participants
classified as having probable dementia without a reported
diagnosis had higher rates of reported difficulty for all
activities than participants with possible or no dementia
(Table 4).
After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, health
status, medical conditions, and physical capacity, persons
who had probable dementia without a reported dementia
diagnosis remained more likely to drive, prepare hot meals,
manage finances and medications, and attend medical visits
alone than those with a reported diagnosis (Figure 1A).
After adjusting for covariates, the odds of potentially unsafe
living conditions, including multiple annual falls; living
alone; and having unmet IADL, ADL, and mobility needs,
was more similar between probable dementia groups (Fig-
ure 1B). The odds of having unmet IADL needs were no
longer statistically significant for any groups.
After excluding participants with probable dementia
who responded independently and reported very good or
excellent memory, prevalence rates and adjusted ORs were
similar. The proportion of both probable dementia groups
reporting potentially unsafe activities and living alone
decreased slightly, whereas the likelihood of potentially
unsafe living conditions increased. Similar patterns were
seen after excluding all participants with probable demen-
tia who responded independently (Table 3). Adjusted ORs
remained similar, but the odds of providing care, having
unmet ADL needs, and falling became nonsignificant in
participants with probable dementia and no reported
diagnosis.

 representative sample. More than half of community-
dwelling older adults suspected of having dementia do
not report a physician diagnosis of dementia, consistent
with
prior
reports.14–16
Older
adults
with
probable
dementia but no reported diagnosis are more likely than
those who report a dementia diagnosis to report engage-
ment in potentially unsafe activities, including driving,
preparing hot meals, managing finances, managing medi-
cations, and attending medical visits alone. Older adults
with probable dementia but no reported diagnosis are
just as likely to live alone and report unmet IADL and
mobility needs as their counterparts with a reported
diagnosis, indicating that their needs may be similar.
Older adults with probable dementia are less likely to
participate
in
potentially
unsafe
activities
than
older
adults with possible or no dementia, although the abso-
lute rates of potentially unsafe activities and higher rates
of unmet needs are notable from a clinical and public
health standpoint.
Previous data on prevalence of driving in dementia is
limited, although the current findings are similar to those
of a previous study in which 20% of drivers aged 80 and
older failed cognitive screening for dementia.40 The preva-
lence
of
PWDs
independently
managing
medications,
finances, or cooking is not known, but dementia is a pre-
dictor of preventable medication-related hospital admis-
sion.41 Managing finances is recognized as one of the first
IADLs affected in dementia, with the potential for finan-
cial mismanagement and exploitation.5,42,43 Potentially
unsafe living conditions have been examined more exten-
sively. The prevalence of at least one fall in the past year
was 48% in older adults with probable dementia in the
current study; several studies have found the incidence and
prevalence of annual falls to be greater than 40% in
PWDs.10,21 Other studies have found similar rates of
approximately one-third of PWDs living alone.9,44 Those
living alone have more unmet needs.
While living alone
was not associated with hospitalization in PWDs belonging
to an integrated healthcare system,9 a prospective study of
139 PWDs living alone found that approximately 22%
experienced
harm
requiring
emergency
services
over
1.5 years of follow-up.6
As expected with functional decline in dementia, the
prevalence of engaging in potentially unsafe activities is
lower in older adults with probable dementia, and preva-
lence of potentially unsafe living conditions is higher than
in older adults without cognitive impairment, perhaps
because adaptation to new or unrecognized disabilities
may be slow. An important finding in older adults with
probable dementia is the greater likelihood of engagement
in
potentially
unsafe
activities
in
persons
without
a
reported dementia diagnosis even after multivariate adjust-
ment given similar to slightly worse performance on cogni-
tive testing than in those with a reported diagnosis. Rates
of unmet needs are similar between these groups.
These findings highlight the importance of under-
standing
older
adults
with
potentially
undiagnosed
dementia, who account for more than 50% of older
adults with probable dementia. These individuals may be
less functionally impaired, creating more diagnostic diffi-
culty and perhaps less safety risk, but these findings show
that
this
group
has
potentially
significant
cognitive
impairment and difficulty with activities. Active assess-
ment of difficulty with activities may help identify older
adults for whom dementia screening and informant report
of symptoms and activities is warranted. It is possible
that these individuals have a dementia diagnosis of which
they are unaware or lack of acceptance of their condi-
tion, contributing to higher rates of potentially unsafe
behaviors. These undiagnosed individuals may also be
able to engage safely in activities and manage living con-
ditions more effectively than older adults who report a
dementia diagnosis. Further investigation of the conse-
quences of continuing to undertake potentially unsafe
activities and living conditions in older adults with diag-
nosed and undiagnosed dementia could help motivate
greater attention to screening and diagnosis of dementia,
as well as efforts to address potential safety hazards in
older adults with dementia, including assisting them and
their families to accept, understand, and adapt to a
dementia diagnosis.
This study has a number of limitations. First, identi-
fying dementia in large population-based studies involves
misclassification in the absence of clinical evaluation and
documentation of cognitive decline. Although dementia
classification in NHATS was rigorously developed and
evaluated, it is more limited than a comprehensive neu-
rological examination. Compared with classification using
extensive cognitive testing in the Aging, Demographics,
and Memory Study,45 the sensitivity of NHATS dementia
classification ranges from 65.7% to 85.7% and speci-
ficity from 83.7% to 87.2%. There was high concor-
dance of cognitive test criteria with reported diagnosis
and AD8 criteria within NHATS, however. Moreover,
the estimated prevalence of dementia in NHATS is more
conservative than in other studies.31 Of participants with
probable dementia, 86% received help with an IADL,
and 98.7% performing IADLs reported difficulty with an
IADL, suggesting that functional impairment, required
for dementia diagnosis, may be present. Self-report, par-
ticularly in older adults with cognitive impairment, is
another limitation,46,47 although 79.1% of participants
with probable dementia had a proxy or assistant during
the
interview.
Sensitivity
analyses
suggest
that
self-
respondents with dementia overreport potentially unsafe
activities
and
underreport
unsafe
living
conditions,
although results were similar when the most unreliable
self-respondents were excluded. It is likely that excluding
all
independent
respondents
with
probable
dementia
underestimates
prevalence,
because
it
is
likely
that
responding independently signifies independence in other
activities.
Dementia
diagnosis
itself
may
be
underre-
ported, although undiagnosed dementia rates were simi-
lar
to
those
of
other
studies.14–16
Categorization
of
activities in NHATS does not capture supervision and
frequency of activities. Last, although these data provide
a population-based understanding of exposure to poten-
tial safety hazards, dementia diagnosis does not automat-
ically mean an individual is no longer competent to
engage safely in these activities.
Given the high prevalence of dementia,1,48 under-
standing the activities and living conditions of PWDs resid-
ing in the community is essential to providing care to this
group of older adults and to public health and policy plan-

 ning. More than 20% of older adults in this sample who
met criteria for probable dementia reported driving, han-
dling finances, managing medications, or attending physi-
cian visits alone. Clinicians may be able to better address
safety in PWDs and underdiagnosis of dementia by inquir-
ing about engagement in potentially unsafe activities and
difficulties in participating in activities. Of older adults
with probable dementia, those who do not report a
dementia diagnosis have similar odds of unmet needs and
more frequently report engaging in potentially unsafe
activities despite difficulty with activities and similar to
slightly worse performance on cognitive testing. Under-
standing the activities and needs of older adults with
potentially undiagnosed dementia and associated health
outcomes may have further implications for dementia
screening, diagnosis, and safety.
