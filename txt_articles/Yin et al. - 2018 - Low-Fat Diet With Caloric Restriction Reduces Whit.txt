Rodent models of both aging and obesity are characterized by inflammation in specific
brain regions, notably the corpus callosum, fornix, and hypothalamus. Microglia,
the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, are important for brain
development, neural support, and homeostasis. However, the effects of diet and lifestyle
on microglia during aging are only partly understood. Here, we report alterations in
microglia phenotype and functions in different brain regions of mice on a high-fat diet
(HFD) or low-fat diet (LFD) during aging and in response to voluntary running wheel
exercise. We compared the expression levels of genes involved in immune response,
phagocytosis, and metabolism in the hypothalamus of 6-month-old HFD and LFD
mice. We also compared the immune response of microglia from HFD or LFD mice
to peripheral inflammation induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). Finally, we investigated the effect of diet, physical exercise, and caloric restriction
(40% reduction compared to ad libitum intake) on microglia in 24-month-old HFD
and LFD mice. Changes in diet caused morphological changes in microglia, but did
not change the microglia response to LPS-induced systemic inflammation. Expression
of phagocytic markers (i.e., Mac-2/Lgals3, Dectin-1/Clec7a, and CD16/CD32) in the
white matter microglia of 24-month-old brain was markedly decreased in calorically
restricted LFD mice. In conclusion, LFD resulted in reduced activation of microglia,
which might be an underlying mechanism for the protective role of caloric restriction
during aging-associated decline.

Low-Fat Reduces Microglia Activation
INTRODUCTION
Aging and obesity are worldwide health issues affecting
millions of people (Han et al., 2011). Both aging and
obesity are linked to chronic low-grade inflammation that is
associated with multisystem diseases (Lumeng and Saltiel, 2011;
Woods et al., 2012). Aging is considered as a pro-obesogenic
factor, associated with age-related metabolic decline, which is
characterized by changes in fat distribution, obesity, and insulin
resistance (Gabriely et al., 2002). Concurrently, obesity can
aggravate age-related decline in physical function and cause
frailty (Villareal et al., 2005). A number of obesity-associated
comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes (Eckel et al., 2011),
hypertension (Kotsis et al., 2010), and cardiovascular disease
(Poirier et al., 2006) may ultimately contribute to premature
aging and shortened lifespan. Importantly, obesity not only
affects the function of peripheral organs, but also influences the
CNS. Previous studies reported that obesity is associated with
synapse loss (Bocarsly et al., 2015), hypothalamic gliosis, and
cognitive deficits (Thaler et al., 2013; Kälin et al., 2015). It was
also proposed that obesity and its direct comorbidities act as
a facilitator and predictor of neurodegenerative diseases (Cai,
2013; van Dijk et al., 2015). Metabolic dysfunction and obesity
are associated with learning and memory impairment in early
old age (Sabia et al., 2009; Singh-Manoux et al., 2012). It has
been suggested that a HFD promotes the progression of obesity
(Golay and Bobbioni, 1997). Thus, investigating the pathological
alterations resulting from HFD in the aging brain will help to
better estimate the role of obesity in neurodegeneration in the
elderly.
The brain has long been viewed as an immune-privileged
organ with limited access for peripheral immune signals.
However, the differently structured blood–
brain barrier in
the hypothalamic ARC-ME complex allows more blood-borne
signals to enter the brain (Gross, 1992). Microglia, the tissue
macrophages of the CNS, play a pivotal role in the chronic
inflammation observed in aging (Norden and Godbout, 2013;
Galatro et al., 2017a,b) as well as metabolic diseases such
as obesity (Kälin et al., 2015). Increased inflammation in
the aging brain is most predominant in the white matter,
and includes loss of myelinated fibers and malformation of
myelin sheaths (Gunning-Dixon et al., 2009). In addition to
aging, an HFD induces brain inflammation (Zhang et al.,
2008). Young wild-type mice on a short-term HFD showed an
increase in microglia numbers and pro-inflammatory factors
in ARC-ME areas (Thaler et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2014), even
before body weight was affected (Gao et al., 2014). HFD may
cause central leptin (Münzberg et al., 2004; Enriori et al.,
2007) and insulin resistance (De Souza et al., 2005), which
underlies increased food intake, body fat content (Rosenbaum
and Leibel, 2010), and adaptive thermogenic responses aimed
at maintaining the increased body fat content (Koch et al.,
2014). Moreover, this condition in the CNS leads to increased
hepatic glucose production (Pocai et al., 2005), and collectively
this underlies an increased risk toward obesity, diabetes,
and cardiovascular disease (Thaler and Schwartz, 2010). In
contrast, a prolonged period of HFD was recently reported
to induce mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in
the hypothalamus (Baufeld et al., 2016). Summarizing these
observations, our understanding of the impact of HFD on
inflammation and the role of microglia in different brain regions
is incomplete.
Lifestyle, e.g., diet pattern and physical exercise, considerably
impacts aging phenotypes (Woods et al., 2012; Akbaraly et al.,
2013), and indeed, caloric restriction has a preventive effect
on age-related chronic diseases (Heilbronn and Ravussin, 2003)
and accelerated aging (Vermeij et al., 2016). For example,
MRI experiments show that caloric restriction can attenuate
age-related deterioration in white matter (Bendlin et al., 2011).
The neuroprotective mechanisms of caloric restriction may
include: (1) upregulation of BDNF (Stranahan et al., 2009) and
heat shock proteins, such as HSP70 (Yu and Mattson, 1999);
(2) increased neuronal resistance to excitotoxic damage (Bruce-
Keller et al., 1999); and (3) inhibition of the increase of age-related
lipid peroxidation (Sohal and Weindruch, 1996; Sharma and
Kaur, 2005). Besides reduced intake of calories, there is also
growing evidence suggesting that physical exercise induces loss
of adipose tissue, decreases the expression of systemic markers
of inflammation (Woods et al., 2012), upregulates the level
of BDNF (Stranahan et al., 2009), and increases hippocampal
neurogenesis (Van Praag et al., 1999; Van der Borght et al.,
2009).
The dynamic communication between microglia and all other
cell types in the CNS helps them perform both their immune
and non-immune functions under homeostasis. Moreover, a
variety of activation states has been described for microglia
upon disease and injury, where the context dictates whether
the outcome for the CNS is tissue-supportive or detrimental
(Li and Barres, 2017). Although the knowledge of microglia
responses to CNS disease is rapidly increasing, the function and
phenotype of microglia under conditions of caloric restriction
and physical exercise are still poorly understood. Hence, the aim
of this study was to investigate the effects of diet, aging, caloric
restriction, and physical exercise on mouse microglia in a basal
and inflammatory state induced by LPS. In different regions
of the brain, microglia were characterized according to their
gene expression pattern, expression of phagocytosis markers and
morphology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
All adult mice of different ages were used and kept under
specified pathogen-free conditions on a 12-h light/dark cycle and
lights switched on at 7:00 am. Animals were sacrificed in the
morning, between 9:00 am and 11:00 am. Details on experimental
design per mouse strain are described below and in Table 1
(i.e., animal strain, supplier, age, exercise, and diet). Throughout
the experiments, mice were kept under close observation and
regularly weighted. All animal work was approved by the Animal
Ethics Committee of University of Groningen, and adhered to the
European Directive (2010/63/EU) on the protection of animals
used for scientific purposes.

Low-Fat Reduces Microglia Activation
C57BL/6 OlaHsd (Harlan)
C57BL/6
OlaHsd
mice
were
obtained
from
Harlan
and
subsequently bred in-house at the University of Groningen.
Food Composition and Intake
Male C57BL/6 OlaHsd mice were subjected to both low-fat (LFD;
6.5% fat, ab Diets 2141 AM-II, Supplementary Data Sheet 1)
and high-fat (HFD; 42% fat, ab Diets 4031.09, Supplementary
Data Sheet 1) diets. The mice were exposed to the different diets
and/or restriction from weaning until sacrifice. Weaning was
performed at day 28 (day 0 was day of birth), after which mice
were individually housed with ad libitum access to food and
water. For the caloric restriction group, mice were exposed to
40% caloric restriction. The restricted mice received their food
3 h before lights were turned off (7:00 pm); they consumed the
food within these 3 h, mostly faster.
Wheel Running and Monitoring
Mice had free access to the running wheels. Voluntary wheel-
running activity was recorded throughout the lifetime of the
mice. The passing of a magnet embedded in the running wheel
past the sensor on the cage would signal a wheel revolution. These
revolutions were collected continuously and stored in 1 min bins
by a Circadian Activity Monitor System (CAMS, by H. M. Cooper
and J. A. Cooper, INSERM U846, Department of Chronobiology,
Bon, France). Raw data were imported into a custom-made
excel macro package (ACTOVIEW, C. K. Mulder, Department
of Molecular Neurobiology, Groningen, Netherlands). Initial
imports condensed the data to 60-min bins, allowing for easy
visual inspection of long-term recordings.
C57BL/6J (Charles River)
For the cohorts of C57BL/6J animals from Charles River, the
mice were treated as described previously (van der Heijden et al.,
2015a). Male C57BL/6J mice at the age of 6 weeks (20 ± 2 g)
were individually housed with ad libitum access to food and
water. After arrival, all mice received a low-fat control diet (LFD;
10% lard; Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, United States;
D12450HY, Supplementary Data Sheet 1) for 6 weeks after which
mice were either switched to a HFD (45% lard; Research Diets;
D12451, Supplementary Data Sheet 1) or kept on the low-fat
control diet. All animals were kept on their respective diets until
time of sacrifice.
LPS Injection
High-fat
diet
and
LFD
mice
(6
months)
were
injected
intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1 mg/kg LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, L4391)
or PBS. After 3 h, animals were anesthetized and perfused with
0.9% saline. The brains were sagittally separated and used for
two purposes: (1) from one half, microglia were acutely isolated
and the RNA extracted (n = 5); (2) from the other half, the
hypothalamus was dissected and RNA isolated (n = 5).
Acute Isolation of Microglia and Cell
Sorting
Microglia were isolated as described in Galatro et al. (2017b)
Brain tissue (n = 5) was mechanically homogenized in HBSS
with 0.6% glucose and 7.5 mM HEPES followed by centrifugation
at 220 RCF, 4◦C for 10 min. In order to remove myelin,
the pellet was re-suspended in a mixture of 22% Percoll
(GE Healthcare, 17-0891-01) and 77% myelin gradient buffer
(5.6 mM NaH2PO4.2H2O, 20 mM Na2HPO4.2H2O, 140 mM
NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 11 mM glucose) and 40 mM NaCl, and
centrifuged for 20 min at 950 RCF at 4◦C. The remaining cell
pellet was incubated with phycoerythrin (PE)-coupled rat anti-
mouse CD11b (Clone M1/70, eBiosciences), FITC-coupled rat
anti-mouse CD45 (Clone 30-F11, eBiosciences). Forward and
side scatter parameters were used to identify single cells and
the exclusion of DAPI was used to select live cells. Microglia
were defined as CD11bposCD45intDAPIneg and sorted on a BD
FACSAria II (BD Biosciences).
Primary Microglia Culture and LPS
Stimulation
Primary microglia cultures were prepared from brains of
postnatal day-1 wild-type male C57Bl/6J mice as previously
described (Schaafsma et al., 2015). Briefly, after the removal
of the meninges and brain stem, the brains were triturated
and washed in medium A (HBSS with 0.6% glucose [D-(+)-
glucose solution, Sigma, G8769], 15 mM HEPES buffer (Lonza
BE17-737E), 1% penicillin/streptomycin). The minced brains
were incubated in 2.5% trypsin at 37◦C for 20 min. The
enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding trypsin inhibitor
medium, followed by washing with medium containing medium
A, 10% FCS, and 0.5 µg/ml DNaseI. Cells were triturated using
a glass pipette in 25 ml normal medium (Dulbecco’
s Modified
Eagle Medium, Lonza, BE12-707F, 10% FCS, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate, Gibco, 11360-070, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin),
and centrifuged at 960 rpm at 12◦C for 12 min. The supernatant
was removed, and then the pellet was resuspended and plated
as 1.5 brains per T75 culture flask in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FCS. After 7 days of culture, 5 ml L929 fibroblast-
conditioned medium was added to 10 ml culture medium
per flask to stimulate microglia proliferation. After around
10 days of culture, astrocytes reached 100% confluence, and
microglia were harvested at the 14th day by orbital shaking
for 1 h at 150 rpm at 37◦C. Microglia were seeded into
3.5 cm 6-well plates, and cultured in the above-mentioned
normal medium and medium collected from the mixed glial
cultures in a ratio of 1:1 at 37◦C with 5% CO2. Male and
female pups were separated based on anogenital distance. The
sex of the pups used for the cultures was confirmed by PCR
on genomic DNA using primers for gene loci on X- and
Y-chromosomes.
Cultured microglia were stimulated with recombinant mouse
leptin (1 µg/ml, R&D, CF 498-OB-01M) for 24 h, followed by
100 ng/ml LPS stimulation for 3 h.
RNA Isolation and RT-qPCR
RNA from sorted microglia and cultured microglia was
extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, 74034)
and RNA from hypothalamus was extracted using RNeasy
Plus
Mini
Kit
(Qiagen,
74134).

reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using
Applied Biosystems Gene Amp 9700 thermal cycler, and
quantitative PCR was performed as previously described
(Raj et al., 2014). See primer information in Supplementary
Table 1.
Tissue Sampling for
Immunohistochemistry
Animals (details are shown in Table 1) were sacrificed and
transcardially perfused with saline. Brains were separated, then
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) in PBS fixed for 1 day (details are shown in Table 1),
dehydrated with 25% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4◦C, and then
frozen at −50◦C. All samples were stored at −80◦C.
Immunohistochemistry
PFA-Fixed Tissue
Brain sections (30 µm) from 4% PFA-fixed mouse brains were
pre-incubated in 0.3% H2O2 at room temperature (RT) for
30 min, and then in 10% serum at RT for 1 h. Sections
were incubated with the primary antibody at 4◦C overnight:
Iba1 (1:1000, WAKO, 019-19741) or Mac-2 (1:1000, Cedarlane,
CL8942AP). After PBS washing, sections were incubated with
the secondary antibody: biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400,
Vector Laboratories, BA-1000) or biotinylated rabbit anti-rat
IgG (1:400, Vector Laboratories, BA-4001) at RT for 1 h, then
with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories,
PK-6100) at RT for 30 min, and finally visualized with 3,
3�-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma, D-5637).
Snap-Frozen Tissue
Brain sections (14 µm) from snap-frozen mouse brains were
acetone-fixed for 10 min, pre-incubated in Peroxidase Blocking
Reagent (DAKO, K4009) for 15 min, and blocked in 5% fetal
bovine serum for 30 min (RT). Sections were incubated with
primary antibodies at RT for 2 h: Dectin-1 (1:100, AbDSerotec,
MCA2289) or CD16/CD32 (1:100, eBioscience, 14-0161-82).
Next, sections were incubated with unconjugated rabbit anti-rat
IgG (Vector Laboratories, AI-4001) at RT for 1 h. Then sections
were incubated with labeled polymer-HRP anti-rabbit (DAKO,
K4009) at RT for 30 min. The complex was visualized after 10 min
of incubation with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate-
chromogen solution (DAKO, K4009) and counterstained with
hematoxylin. The visualization and counterstaining were both
done at RT.
Imaging Analysis
Immunohistochemically stained sections were imaged using
a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer (Hamamatsu Photonics). The
images of AEC-stained sections (Figure 5) were analyzed
with the positive pixel count algorithm (Imagescope). 5–
10 images (20× magnification) from the internal capsule
were quantified for each sample (n = 4–
7). The average
number of positive pixels was compared between groups. The
images of DAB-stained sections (Figure 1) were analyzed
using Image J. Microglia cell numbers were determined
by
binary
thresholding

ImageJ
followed
by
‘

and
‘

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. For
comparison of two different groups, a two-tailed Student’
s t-test
was used. Comparisons of multiple groups were analyzed by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc
analysis using Bonferroni’
s multiple-comparison test. Asterisks
indicate: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.
RESULTS
HFD Augments the Aging-Induced
Increase in Microglial Cell Number and
Morphological Changes
Here we evaluated regional differences in the number of
microglia of 6-, 9-, and 12-month-old HFD (45% fat) and LFD
(10% fat) mice using Iba1 immunohistochemistry (Figure 1A).
Microglia numbers were determined in the cortex, hypothalamus,
and cerebellum (Figure 1B). As described previously, Iba1
reactivity of microglia in the white matter of the CNS increases
with age (Raj et al., 2017). In the cortex, no significant
differences in the number of microglia between LFD and
HFD mice were detected at these respective ages (Figure 1B).
In the hypothalamus, microglia numbers were significantly
higher in both HFD and LFD mice at 12 months of age
compared to 6-month-old mice; and at 12 months microglia
numbers were significantly increased in HFD compared to
LFD mice (Figure 1B). In the cerebellum, microglia numbers
were significantly increased in 12-month-old mice compared to
6-month-old mice for both HFD and LFD mice (Figure 1B).
The Effect of HFD on LPS-Induced Gene
Expression in Total Brain Microglia
To assess if HFD affected the microglia response to an
inflammatory challenge, microglia were isolated from the
brain of 6-month-old LFD and HFD mice, 3 h after an
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with PBS or LPS (1 mg/kg).
The mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory, phagocytic,
and metabolic genes were determined. The basal expression
of pro-inflammatory genes Il-1β, Tnf-α, and Il-6 and other
immune-related genes Spp1 and Cybb was not significantly
different between HFD and LFD microglia. As expected,
i.p. injection with LPS resulted in a significant increase in
proinfammatory and immune gene expression. However, this
response was not significantly different between HFD and LFD
microglia (Figures 2A,B). Expression levels of the phagocytic
markers Axl and Lgals3 (Mac-2) were induced by LPS but
not significantly different between LFD and HFD conditions
(Figure 2C). Apoe, a gene involved in lipid metabolism,
was induced by LPS, in both LFD and HFD microglia
(Figure 2D). Collectively, these data indicate that a 6-month
HFD did not result in generalized microglial activation or

as LPS.
The Effect of HFD on LPS-Induced Gene
Expression in Total Hypothalamus
In microglia isolated from total mouse brain, no significant
changes in LPS-induced inflammatory responses were observed
under LFD and HFD conditions. However, it is possible that
regional effects of LFD/HFD on microglia were obscured
when analyzing total brain microglia. The hypothalamus for
example is substantially affected by HFD (Thaler et al., 2012;
Gao et al., 2014). Hence, gene-expression levels of microglia-
associated genes were determined in the hypothalamus of 6-
month-old LFD and HFD mice, which received an i.p. injection
of PBS or LPS (1 mg/kg). LPS induced a significant increase
in expression of the proinflammatory cytokine genes Il-1β
and Tnf-α in the hypothalamus of both HFD and LFD mice,
but their expression was not significantly different between
HFD and LFD mice (Figure 3A). With the exception of
Ifitm2, no significant effect of HFD on the expression of
several immune-response genes, CD44, Cryab, Csf-1, Sirpa,
Spp1, and Ifitm3 was detected. LPS significantly induced CD44,
Csf-1, and Ifitm3 expression levels in both LFD and HFD
hypothalamus (Figure 3B). No substantial differences in the
hypothalamus were observed in the expression of phagocytic
markers CD36, Axl, Clec7a (Dectin-1), and Lgals3 between
LFD and HFD hypothalamus was detected. LPS significantly
increased expression of CD36, Axl, and Lgals3 in LFD and
HFD hypothalamus (Figure 3C). No significant effect of
HFD on Apoe, Lpl, and Lrp12 was detected (Figure 3D). In
summary, these data indicate that LPS treatment resulted in
increased expression of a range of immune-, phagocytosis-,
and metabolism-associated genes in the hypothamalus, but no
significant differences were detected between LFD and HFD
samples.

(van der Heijden et al., 2015a,b). In mice on a HFD (45% fat),
leptin plasma levels strongly increased from 10 to 40 ng/ml,
peaked around 28 weeks and remained elevated. Previous data
indicated that in vitro pretreatment of rat microglia with leptin
for 24 h, was capable of potentiating a subsequent LPS response,
resulting in approximately 2-fold higher Il-1β release (Pinteaux
et al., 2007; Lafrance et al., 2010). However, a concomitant
increase in Il-1β mRNA was not detected (Lafrance et al.,
2010). As described above, we did not observe an effect on LPS
responsiveness in vivo. Therefore, we next evaluated if leptin
(1 µg/ml) altered the inflammatory response of male primary
microglia in vitro. In primary microglia, LPS induced a significant
upregulation of the pro-inflammatory genes Il-1β and Tnf-α.
However, in agreement with the data from rat microglia (Lafrance
et al., 2010), pretreatment with leptin for 24 h did not alter
the microglia response to LPS at the mRNA level (Figure 4).
These data show that leptin preconditioning of microglia in vitro
did not result in increased inflammatory gene expression nor
in enhanced LPS sensitivity, which is in contrast to aging,
where this microglial hyperreactivity was observed (Henry et al.,
2009).
Effects of Running-Wheel Exercise and
Caloric Restriction on White Matter
Inflammation
Increased inflammation in the aging human brain is most
predominantly observed in the white matter (Gunning-Dixon
et al., 2009). However, the effect of long-term diet pattern and
exercise on the aging brain and white matter inflammation has
not been assessed. We therefore evaluated microglia numbers
and activation in white matter regions in 6- and 24-month-
old LFD and HFD mice. In addition, 24-month-old mice were
subjected either to a lifelong voluntary running wheel paradigm
or lifelong caloric restriction (Figure 5). At the age of 24 months,
both HFD and LFD mice showed increased expression of
Iba1. Clustering of microglia was also observed in fimbriae
(Figures 5A,B). Remarkably, in LFD mice, caloric restriction

completely prevented this increase in Iba1 expression, whereas
in HFD mice, caloric restriction had little effect (Figure 5C).
Microglial expression of the phagocytic marker Mac-2 (Lgals3)
in the fimbria was increased in both 24-month-old HFD and
LFD mice when compared to 6-month-old mice (Figures 5A,B).
Similar to Iba1, the expression of the phagocytic marker
Mac-2 was completely absent in 24-month-old LFD mice with
caloric restriction, indicating that LFD plus caloric restriction
reduces microglia activation (Figure 5C). In another prominent
white-matter brain region, the internal capsule, we quantified
the expression of phagocytic markers Dectin-1 and CD16/CD32
in 24-month-old HFD- and LFD mice. These mice either had
access to a running wheel or were subjected to caloric restriction
(Figures 5D,E). Remarkably, significant expression of Dectin-1

and CD16/CD32 was observed in the white matter bundle in
all experimental groups except in caloric-restricted LFD mice
(Figures 5D,E).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we observed a marked effect of aging on
microglia numbers in the hypothalamus and cerebellum. In
HFD mice, the cell number of microglia increased compared
to their age-matched LFD littermates, especially at the age
of
9
and
12
months.
These
results
are
in
accordance
with earlier studies. An increase in microglia cell number
has been observed previously in the hypothalamus of mice
subjected to 20-week HFD (Valdearcos et al., 2014; Baufeld
et al., 2016). The expression of inflammatory genes increased
significantly in the cerebellum after a 16-week HFD, while those
genes in cortex remained unchanged (Guillemot-Legris et al.,
2016).
Previous data has indicated that neuroinflammation can be
influenced by caloric intake, where not only fat content, but also
the source of the fat and carbohydrate content have been reported
to influence microglia in the hypothalamus (Maric et al., 2014;
Valdearcos et al., 2014; André et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2017).
In particular, saturated fatty acids have been connected with
microglia-induced inflammation (Valdearcos et al., 2014). More
recently, it was shown that carbohydrates are mainly responsible
for microgliosis in the hypothalamus of mice on a diet with
high caloric content (Gao et al., 2017). However, the fact that
we observed increased microglia numbers in mice subjected to
caloric restriction in combination with HFD suggests that under
our experimental conditions, it is mainly the fat content and/or
composition that dictated microglia activation.
Basal expression levels of pro-inflammatory, phagocytosis,
immune response, and energy metabolism markers did not differ
in microglia isolated from the total brain tissue of HFD and
LFD mice. Furthermore, microglial responsiveness to LPS did
not differ between HFD and LFD mice, in agreement with earlier
results (Baufeld et al., 2016). In rats on an 8-week high-saturated-
fat diet, hypothalamic inflammation markers were increased but
no effect of diet on the change in core body temperature after a
peripheral LPS challenge was observed (Maric et al., 2014).
Previous experiments in HFD mice showed an increased
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of
NF-κB in the hypothalamus (De Souza et al., 2005). Microglia
have been proposed to be important players in this inflammatory
cascade, perpetuating hypothalamic injury (Zhang et al., 2008;
Milanski et al., 2009; Posey et al., 2009; Thaler et al., 2012).
Inflammation in the hypothalamus disrupts feeding-related
pathways, and promotes insulin and leptin resistance, thereby
favoring an elevated body weight (De Souza et al., 2005; Posey
et al., 2009; Spencer and Tilbrook, 2011). However, the exact
role of microglia in HFD-induced neuroinflammation is still
poorly understood. A recent study showed that HFD induced
an acute inflammatory response in the hypothalamus after
3 days, but this increased expression of proinflammatory genes
was no longer observed after 4 and 8 weeks. In contrast, at
these time points a more pronounced anti-inflammatory gene
expression profile was observed (Baufeld et al., 2016). However,
it has been clearly demonstrated that microglia play critical
roles in neuroinflammation in response to HFD. Depletion
of microglia resulted in reduced hypothalamic inflammation
(Valdearcos et al., 2014) and a similar effect was seen
when proliferation of microglia was inhibited (André et al.,
2017).
The detrimental effect of HFD on the brain predominantly
occurs in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus has an important
role in feeding behavior and neuroendocrine/autonomic outflow,
where leptin and insulin play key roles in regulating hunger
signals and energy expenditure, mainly by acting through
neuronal subpopulations in the arcuate nucleus (Yi et al., 2012).
In the hypothalamus, the expression of most genes involved
in pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, immune response,
phagocytosis, and metabolism in HFD and LFD mice were
not significantly different. However, a significant difference was
observed in the expression of interferon-induced transmembrane

protein 2 (Ifitm2), where HFD mice showed a significant higher
expression compared to LFD mice. In addition, the expression
of Ifitm3 showed a strong tendency to being increased in HFD
mice compared to LFD mice after LPS injection, although the
difference did not reach statistical significance. Ifitm proteins
are important players in the type I interferon antiviral response.
Deletion of Ifitm genes in mice results in an obese phenotype
and metabolic dysfunction. The microglia in the hypothalamus
of IfitmDel mice have an activated phenotype and an exaggerated
pro-inflammatory response to Poly I:C, a viral mimetic and TLR3
agonist (Wee et al., 2015).
Leptin, a satiety hormone secreted by adipose tissue, is
essential in regulating body weight and can enter the brain
(Rivest, 2002). Since leptin is a prominent factor in the
detrimental effects of HFD (Lin et al., 2000), the effect of leptin
on microglia was analyzed both in vivo and in vitro. We observed
that high peripheral levels of leptin in HFD mice were not
accompanied by an altered responsiveness of microglia to a
systemic inflammatory stimulus in comparison to microglia from
LFD mice. Previous studies reported that in obesity, the ability of
leptin to cross the blood–
brain barrier is reduced (Burguera et al.,
2000; Banks et al., 2006). In order to test the effect of leptin on
microglia directly, we pretreated primary microglia with leptin,
which did not change basal inflammatory gene-expression levels
or the response to an LPS challenge. In summary, neither HFD
nor leptin induced changes in the inflammatory responses of
microglia in aging mice.
Although no major differences were observed in cytokine
expression levels in microglia isolated from total brain tissue
and hypothalamic tissue from HFD and LFD mice, we observed
very profound differences in neuroinflammation and phagocytic
markers in prominent white matter bundles between HFD
and LFD mice at different ages in combination with caloric
restriction. Previous studies showed that dietary intervention,
such as caloric restriction, slows down the aging process
(Johnson et al., 2006; Colman et al., 2014). Indeed a lifelong
reduction in caloric intake reduces the oxidative damage in the
brain (Mattson et al., 2001), preserves long-term potentiation
of synaptic transmission (Hori et al., 1992), and ameliorates
cognitive decline (Pitsikas and Algeri, 1992). In peripheral nerves,
caloric restriction maintains the nerve structure, improves
nerve function, and attenuates the age-associated reduction
of myelin proteins and widening of the nodes of Ranvier
(Rangaraju et al., 2009). The underlying mechanisms might
be the expression of protein chaperones and activation of
the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (Rangaraju et al., 2009).
Here, the reduction of phagocytic markers in white matter
microglia of LFD with caloric restriction might reflect decreased
axonal stress in the CNS. However, the pathology of axons
at LFD vs. HFD combined with caloric restriction conditions
has not been examined yet. Physical exercise, which was
provided by a running wheel in our study, reduced the risk of
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, stroke, and is
protective against age-related cognitive decline (McKee et al.,
2014). In our study, the expression of Mac-2 and Dectin-1
remained high in the running-wheel HFD group, only the
expression of CD16/CD32 was partially decreased in LFD mice
in the running-wheel experiment. However, the expression
of CD16/CD32 was still significantly higher in HFD mice
than in LFD mice with caloric restriction. Although previous
studies reported that physical exercise plays an equivalent
role in terms of energy balance (Redman et al., 2007) and
regulating insulin resistance (Coker et al., 2009), our data
suggest that in mice, caloric restriction might be a more
effective intervention in protecting white matter structures
than physical exercise as expression of markers of microglia
activation and phagocytosis (CD16/CD32, Mac-2, and Dectin-1)
was notably absent in the white matter of caloric restriction LFD
mice.
In this study, we show that HFD increased the number of
microglia in the hypothalamus and both number and soma
size of microglia were increased in the cerebellum during
aging in HFD mice. Under basal- or LPS-induced inflammatory
conditions, gene expression analysis of the total brain microglia
population or hypothalamus tissue showed similar findings
in HFD and LFD mice. Caloric restriction in LFD mice
prevented the increased expression of phagocytic markers in
white matter microglia with aging, and this protective effect
of caloric restriction was not observed in HFD mice. Because
running wheel access did not affect white matter microglia
activation in either diet, dietary fat as well as caloric content
may play an important role in the inflammatory process in brain
aging.
