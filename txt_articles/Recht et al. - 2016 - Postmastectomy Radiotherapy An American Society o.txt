ABSTRACT
Purpose. A joint American Society of Clinical Oncology,
American Society for Radiation Oncology, and Society of
Surgical Oncology panel convened to develop a focused
update of the American Society of Clinical Oncology guide-
lineconcerninguse ofpostmastectomy radiotherapy(PMRT).
Methods. A recent systematic literature review by Cancer
Care Ontario provided the primary evidentiary basis. The
joint panel also reviewed targeted literature searches to
identify new, potentially practice-changing data.
Recommendations. The panel unanimously agreed that
available evidence shows that PMRT reduces the risks of
locoregional failure (LRF), any recurrence, and breast
cancer mortality for patients with T1-2 breast cancer with
one to three positive axillary nodes. However, some subsets
of these patients are likely to have such a low risk of LRF
that the absolute benefit of PMRT is outweighed by its
potential toxicities. In addition, the acceptable ratio of
benefit to toxicity varies among patients and physicians.
Thus, the decision to recommend PMRT requires a great
deal of clinical judgment. The panel agreed clinicians
making such recommendations for individual patients
should consider factors that may decrease the risk of LRF,
attenuate the benefit of reduced breast cancer-specific
mortality, and/or increase risk of complications resulting
from PMRT. When clinicians and patients elect to omit
axillary dissection after a positive sentinel node biopsy, the
panel recommends that these patients receive PMRT only
if there is already sufficient information to justify its use
without needing to know additional axillary nodes are
involved. Patients with axillary nodal involvement after
neoadjuvant systemic therapy should receive PMRT. The
panel recommends treatment generally be administered to
both the internal mammary nodes and the supraclavicular-
This guideline was developed through collaboration between the
American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society for
Radiation Oncology, and the Society of Surgical Oncology and is

Oncology, Practical Radiation Oncology, and Annals of Surgical

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
guideline for the use of postmastectomy radiotherapy
(PMRT) was published in 2001.1 This update of that
guideline, completed in collaboration with the American
Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the Society
of Surgical Oncology (SSO), focuses on key areas of
ongoing controversy, including the use of PMRT for
patients with one to three positive lymph nodes, use of
PMRT for patients undergoing neoadjuvant systemic
therapy (NAST), and selected technical aspects of PMRT,
particularly the extent of regional nodal irradiation (RNI).
The question of whether PMRT is indicated in women with
T1-2 tumors and a positive sentinel node biopsy (SNB)
who do not undergo completion axillary lymph node dis-
section (ALND) is also discussed.
The use of PMRT has been widely accepted for patients
with four or more positive lymph nodes,2,3 but there is still
controversy regarding the value of PMRT for those with
one to three positive nodes. In 2014, the Early Breast
Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) pub-
lished an updated meta-analysis of the effects of PMRT.4
Its findings were summarized in a recent review by Cancer
Care Ontario (CCO), which was reviewed by the panel
(Table 1).5 There were 22 trials that in aggregate accrued
8,135 women between 1964 and 1986 who were randomly
assigned to receive or not receive radiotherapy to the chest
wall and regional lymph nodes after mastectomy and
axillary surgery. Our panel focused on the results for the
3,786 women who underwent axillary dissection, defined
as: inclusion in a protocol requiring at least an anatomic
level I to II dissection, a median of 10 nodes examined in
the study population, or individual patient data showing 10
or more recovered nodes. The EBCTCG performed addi-
tional subset analyses of those trials in which systemic
therapy was routinely administered. Among the 1,133
patients with one to three positive nodes who had under-
gone axillary dissection and received systemic therapy, the
10-year rate of isolated LRF (defined as local recurrence
without simultaneous or preceding distant failure) was
21.0 %
without
irradiation
and
4.3 %
with
PMRT
(P \ .001). The 10-year rate for any recurrence (locore-
gional or distant) was 45.5 % without irradiation and
33.8 % with irradiation (P \ .001), and the respective
20-year rates of breast cancer mortality were 49.4 % and
41.5 % (P = .01; relative risk, 0.78). There were no dif-
ferences in the benefits of PMRT for patients with one
positive node compared with those with two or three pos-
itive nodes with regard to any first recurrence or breast
cancer mortality. However, the median follow-up for all
patients in the meta-analysis was only 9.4 years, which
means that relatively small numbers of patients were
observable at 20 years.

 The most recent EBCTCG meta-analysis provides evi-
dence that PMRT is highly effective at preventing LRF
and, in an era of intermediate to high risk for recurrence,
reduces the risk of patients with one to three nodes
developing distant metastases and dying as a result of
breast cancer. However, more recent evidence suggests that
these findings may not be directly applicable to all patients
with one to three positive nodes in the current era, when
many of these patients are at much lower risk for recur-
rence.
The
trials
included
by
the
EBCTCG
were
predominantly conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Rates of
LRF and any recurrence reported in this meta-analysis
were considerably higher than those reported in many
contemporaneous and later series. Multiple studies from
North America, Europe, and Asia of patients treated with
mastectomy and systemic therapy without irradiation since
1990 have reported much lower 5- to 10-year actuarial LRF
rates, with the most recent series usually reporting local
LRF rates lower than 10 % (Table 2). The divergence
between the rates reported by the EBCTCG and contem-
porary series seems to have increased over time since the
original ASCO PMRT guideline was published.
This trend of decreasing LRF rates over time likely
results from multiple factors. These include decreasing
average tumor sizes and a smaller average number of
positive lymph nodes than that reported in some of the
earlier randomized trials of PMRT23; a higher average
number of resected lymph nodes in axillary lymph node
dissections in more recent years, reflecting more complete
axillary clearance; and the use of increasingly effective
systemic therapy regimens. The trials included in the
EBCTCG meta-analysis were primarily conducted in the
1970s and 1980s, with a median of fewer than 10 resected
lymph
nodes.
Chemotherapy
was
most
commonly
cyclophosphamide,
methotrexate,
and
fluorouracil;
methotrexate plus fluorouracil; or single-agent cyclophos-
phamide or melphalan (Data Supplement Table 1).4 Only a
few trials included early doxorubicin-containing regimens.
Ovarian irradiation was used in three trials. Tamoxifen was
often administered for short courses (eg, for only 1 year in
the Danish trial for postmenopausal women24), and gen-
erally, patients did not receive both tamoxifen and
chemotherapy. The results of the trials included in the
meta-analysis thus do not reflect the advances in systemic
therapy made since 1986 and hence are not representative
of current practice. These advances include the advent of
adjuvant use of taxanes, dose-dense chemotherapy sched-
ules, supportive care measures that improve chemotherapy

with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive
cancers, adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for post-
menopausal
women,

(ovarian ablation plus aromatase inhibitor therapy) in pre-
menopausal women, and the use of prolonged adjuvant
hormonal therapy (eg, 10 years of tamoxifen or 5 years of
tamoxifen followed by 5 years of aromatase inhibitor
therapy). As adjuvant systemic therapy improves, the risk
of LRF is likely to decrease, and hence, the benefits seen of
PMRT might decrease in both relative and absolute terms.
In view of the importance of the question of whether the
benefits of PMRT (including its impact on overall survival)
outweigh its known toxicities for this large group of
patients with cancer, ASCO convened a guideline update
panel in collaboration with ASTRO and SSO to provide
recommendations for the use of PMRT in patients with T1
and T2 tumors (B5 cm) and one to three involved nodes.
On the basis of its discussion of the current concerns of
clinicians and recent publications,25–27 and with the
approval of the ASCO Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory
Group co-chairs, the panel also addressed recommenda-
tions regarding the use of PMRT for patients undergoing
SNB without ALND and for those treated with NAST and
the optimal extent of RNI.
FOCUSED GUIDELINE UPDATE QUESTIONS
Question 1: Is PMRT indicated in patients with T1-2
tumors with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes who
undergo ALND?
Question 2: Is PMRT indicated in patients with T1-2
tumors and a positive SNB who do not undergo completion
ALND?
Question 3: Is PMRT indicated in patients presenting
with clinical stage I or II cancers who have received
NAST?
Question 4: Should RNI include the internal mammary
(IMNs) and/or supraclavicular-axillary apical nodes when
PMRT is used in patients with T1-2 tumors with one to
three positive axillary nodes?
METHODS
Guideline Update Process
ASCO uses a signals approach to facilitate guideline
updating. This approach is intended to identify new,
potentially practice-changing data that might translate into
revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on
targeted literature searching and the expertise of ASCO
guideline
panel
members
to
identify
signals.
The
Methodology Supplement published with this article pro-
vides additional information about the signals approach.
The 2014 publication of the EBCTCG meta-analysis4
provided the signal for this focused update. Based in large
part on this signal, the ASCO Breast Cancer Advisory
Group ranked updating the ASCO PMRT guideline ques-
tion concerning use of PMRT for patients with one to three
positive lymph nodes as a high priority. To that end, a joint
ASCO–ASTRO–SSO panel was formed to review the
evidence and formulate updated recommendations for
practice.
The systematic review of literature by the CCO of
locoregional therapy for locally advanced breast cancer
guideline provided the primary evidentiary basis for the
ASCO guideline focused update.5 The CCO literature
searches identified systematic reviews, meta-analyses,
randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and clinical
practice guidelines that studied locoregional therapy for
locally advanced breast cancer. For studies to be included
in the analysis, the CCO required them to have at least 50
patients, have a prospective design, and provide a statistical
comparison of the interventions of interest. At the request
of ASCO, CCO guideline staff conducted an updated
search of the CCO systematic review. The yield from the
updated CCO search was reviewed for new, potentially
practice-changing data.
Two additional targeted searches were conducted by the
ASCO Guidelines Division staff to identify systematic
reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials of
PMRT
in
women
who
had
received
neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and of technical aspects of PMRT, espe-
cially RNI. A third targeted literature search and review
was conducted to identify single-center and multi-institu-
tional prospective and retrospective studies of patients
treated since the PMRT trials in the EBCTCG meta-anal-
ysis were completed. Inclusion criteria for this targeted
review were: retrospective or prospective study published
between January 2001 and July 2015, patients accrued
from 1985 or later, 150 or more patients explicitly identi-
fied with T1-2 cancers with one to three positive nodes,
patients not treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and
median follow-up 48 months or longer.
The entire panel contributed to the development of the
guideline, provided critical review, and finalized the guide-
line recommendation. All ASCO guidelines are reviewed
and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines
Committee. This focused update was reviewed by the
ASTRO Guidelines Committee and approved by the ASTRO
Board of Directors; the update was also reviewed by the SSO
Breast Cancer Disease Site Work Group and approved by the
SSO Quality Committee and Executive Council.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Clinical Question 1
Is PMRT indicated in patients With T1-2 tumors with
one to three positive axillary lymph nodes who undergo
ALND?
Updated Recommendations
Recommendation 1a
The panel unanimously agreed that
the available evidence shows that PMRT reduces the risks
of LRF, any recurrence, and breast cancer mortality for
patients with T1-2 breast cancer with one to three positive
axillary nodes (type: evidence based; evidence quality:
high; strength of recommendation: strong). However, some
subsets of these patients are likely to have such a low risk
of LRF that the absolute benefit of PMRT is outweighed by
its potential toxicities (type: evidence based; evidence
quality: intermediate; strength of recommendation: strong).
In addition, the acceptable ratio of benefit to toxicity varies
among patients and physicians. Thus, the decision to rec-
ommend PMRT or not requires a great deal of clinical
judgment. The panel agreed clinicians making such rec-
ommendations for individual patients should consider
factors that may decrease the risk of LRF, attenuate the
benefit of reduced breast cancer-specific mortality, and/or
increase the risk of complications resulting from PMRT.
These
factors
include:
patient
characteristics
(eg,
age [
40–45 years, limited life expectancy because of older
age or comorbidities, or coexisting conditions that might
increase the risk of complications), pathologic findings
associated with a lower tumor burden (eg, T1 tumor size,
absence of lymphovascular invasion, presence of only a
single positive node and/or small size of nodal metastases,
or substantial response to NAST), and biologic character-
istics of the cancer associated with better outcomes and
survival and/or greater effectiveness of systemic therapy
(eg, low tumor grade or strong hormonal sensitivity; type:
informal
consensus;
evidence
quality:
intermediate;
strength of recommendation: moderate). There are several
risk-adaptive models that physicians may find useful in
42
A. Recht et al.
 explaining the benefits of PMRT during shared decision
making with patients. However, the panel found insuffi-
cient evidence to endorse any specific model or to
unambiguously define specific patient subgroups to which
PMRT should not be administered (type: no recommen-
dation; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation:
weak). Further research is needed on how to accurately
estimate individuals’ risk of LRF and hence their potential
reductions in LRF and breast cancer mortality.
Recommendation
1b
The
decision
to
use
PMRT
should be made in a multidisciplinary fashion through
discussion among providers from all treating disciplines
early in a patient’s treatment course (soon after surgery or
before or soon after the initiation of systemic therapy),
either in the context of a formal tumor board or by referral
(type: informal consensus; evidence quality: insufficient;
strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation
1c
Decision
making
must
fully
involve the patient, whose values as to what constitutes
sufficient benefit and how to weigh the risk of complica-
tions against this in light of the best information the
treating physicians can provide regarding PMRT in her
situation must be respected and incorporated into the final
treatment choice (type: informal consensus; evidence
quality: insufficient; strength of recommendation: strong).
Literature Review and Analysis
The grouping of patients
with breast cancer in relation to the number of involved
axillary nodes (eg, zero, one to three, four to nine, or [
10)
is of long standing in clinical trials and has been codified in
the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for
International
Cancer
Control
TNM
staging
systems.
However, these divisions have arguably been made much
less important by improved understanding of the biology of
breast cancer. Certainly, there is likely little difference in
prognosis or benefit of therapy for women with three versus
four positive nodes, but there may well be substantial
difference between those with a single node with minimal
metastatic burden and those with three nodes with bulky
metastases. In addition, the prognostic and therapeutic
impacts of a particular number of positive nodes may be
different in patients who undergo SNB without ALND than
in those who undergo ALND, because the total number of
positive nodes may only be inferred if only SNB is
performed (Clinical Question 2 provides a discussion of the
use of PMRT for patients treated with SNB without
completion ALND). Nonetheless, although such division of
patients into groups on the basis of the number of involved
nodes may be less operationally useful than in the past, it
remains deeply embedded within the structure of clinical
trial design, data analysis, and staging, making it difficult
to avoid addressing the issue of the value of PMRT without
using this categorization. Therefore, the panel focused its
attention on patients with one to three positive nodes while
recognizing that distinctions between the historic nodal
prognostic groups are increasingly difficult to justify.
The recent EBCTCG meta-analysis provides consider-
able evidence that for patients with T1-2 tumors with one
to three nodes PMRT reduces the risk of developing any
recurrence and dying as a result of breast cancer and
markedly reduces the risk LRF. However, as previously
noted, the LRF rate in patients not undergoing irradiation
in the trials reported in the EBCTGC (21 %) was higher
than that seen in most studies using more modern surgery
and more contemporary adjuvant systemic therapies (most
studies report LRF rates ranging from 4 % to 10 %;
Table 2), leading the panel to question the generalizability
of the EBCTCG results to all patients. Hence, not all
patients treated with current standard axillary dissection
and modern systemic therapy regimens will likely benefit
sufficiently from PMRT to justify its use. Although mor-
bidities resulting from PMRT have diminished over time
because of improved radiation treatment planning and
delivery techniques, compared with those used at the time
of the trials reported in the EBTCG meta-analysis,28 they
are not negligible. Some, such as radiation-induced cardiac
disease29–32 and cancers,33 may take decades to appear;
hence, their ultimate rates with modern PMRT techniques
cannot yet be ascertained. RNI may increase the risk of
lymphedema, especially in patients who also undergo
ALND.26,34 Furthermore, many more patients now undergo
breast reconstructive surgery. Administration of PMRT can
worsen cosmetic results and increase the risk of both short-
and long-term complications.35,36 Therefore, if it can be
determined that the risk of LRF is low for certain sub-
groups of patients, then by inference any reduction in
breast cancer mortality would be low or negligible, making
PMRT unadvisable in such patients.
Previous estimates of the value of irradiation in patients
treated with breast-conserving surgery have suggested that
radiation treatment has reduced impact on survival when it
changes the risk of local recurrence risk by less than
10 %.37 Comparable data are not available for patients with
one to three positive nodes in the EBCTCG meta-analysis,
although some studies support that smaller reductions in
regional recurrence can reduce breast cancer mortality (as
discussed in Clinical Question 4). Furthermore, individual
clinicians and patients will differ on the precise level of
benefit (either a reduction in LRF, any recurrence, or breast
cancer mortality) they feel is sufficient to justify PMRT,
even if its impact could be accurately calculated. In addi-
tion, some have argued that the total risk of relapse would
be a better surrogate or proxy than LRF to guide this
decision making, because PMRT may eradicate areas of
Postmastectomy Radiotherapy
43
 disease not destroyed by systemic therapy that could result
in eventual tumor dissemination but may not manifest
themselves clinically at those sites before (or after) sys-
temic relapse. Hence, the panel cannot set a specific
threshold for a risk of LRF that would justify the use or
omission of PMRT.
Because the absolute benefit of PMRT seems likely to be
greater for those patients with a higher risk of recurrence,
the panel supports the use of a risk-adaptive strategy to
guide patient selection for PMRT that attempts to balance
the potential benefits of PMRT against its potential harms.
Such a calculation should be based on: patient character-
istics predicting for a lower risk of LRF or shorter life
expectancy or an increased risk of complications, patho-
logic findings predicting a smaller tumor burden after
definitive surgery, biologic factors predicting better out-
come and survival, and the expected effectiveness of
planned systemic therapy in order to balance benefits
against harms. Evidence regarding the importance of indi-
vidual factors is often based on older studies and limited
data and is often contradictory. The effect of these factors
in different studies often varies substantially. Until more
definitive evidence is available, using its best clinical
opinion, the panel recommends that such a strategy or risk
estimation include assessment of patient age as it affects the
risk of LRF,7,10,21,22,38,39 estimated life expectancy in
relation to age and comorbid conditions that might reduce
life expectancy40–44 or increase the risk of complica-
tions,45–49 tumor size,6,7 axillary lymph node burden

systemic therapy (Data Supplement provides discussions of
these and additional factors, such as margin status57,58 and
extranodal extension16,19,20). Several groups have proposed
prognostic models to estimate the risk of LRF after mas-
tectomy by combining several of these factors.10,16,20,22,38
Although the panel cannot endorse any specific model,
because the models have yet to be validated, physicians
may find them useful in explaining the benefits of PMRT.
Further research is needed on these models and how to
accurately estimate an individual’s risk of LRF and hence
the potential reduction in LRF and breast cancer mortality.
Finally, the panel noted that the United Kingdom
Medical Research Council SUPREMO (Selective Use of
Postoperative
Radiotherapy
After
Mastectomy)
trial59
randomly allocated approximately 1,600 patients with
high-risk node-negative disease and one to three positive
nodes
(including
when
found
after
neoadjuvant
chemotherapy) from June 2006 to April 2013 to receive
PMRT or not. The results of this trial may eventually help
determine which patients are most likely to benefit from
PMRT when modern systemic therapy and surgery are
used.
Clinical Question 2
Is PMRT indicated in patients with T1-2 tumors and a
positive SNB who do not undergo completion ALND?
Recommendation
For patients with clinical T1-2 tumors
with clinically negative nodes, SNB is now generally
performed at the time of mastectomy, with omission of
ALND if the nodes are negative. ALND has generally been
performed if the nodes are positive, but there is increasing
controversy about whether this is always necessary,
especially if there is limited disease in the affected
nodes. The panel recognizes that some clinicians omit
axillary dissection with one or two positive sentinel nodes
in patients treated with mastectomy. This practice is
primarily based on extrapolation of data from randomized
trials of patients treated exclusively or predominantly with
breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation or
breast plus axillary irradiation. In such cases where
clinicians and patients elect to omit axillary dissection,
the panel recommends that these patients receive PMRT
only if there is already sufficient information to justify its
use without needing to know that additional axillary nodes
are involved (type: informal consensus; evidence quality:
weak; strength of recommendation: moderate).
Literature
Review
and
Analysis
The
discussion
of
Clinical Question 1 was based on the assumption that
patients had undergone level I to II ALND. However, it is
not clear whether the clinical implications of positive nodes
found on SNB are the same as those for patients
undergoing ALND, because the extent of surgery is
smaller, and there is a substantial chance of additional
positive nonsentinel nodes remaining in the patient treated
with SNB alone. The 2014 ASCO Panel on Sentinel
Lymph Node Biopsy discussed the role of ALND for
patients undergoing mastectomy (in Clinical Question 2.2
of its guideline).60 It concluded the following: ‘‘Clinicians
may offer ALND for women with early-stage breast cancer
with nodal metastases found on SNB who will undergo
mastectomy. Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh
harms.
Evidence
quality:
low.
Strength
of
recommendation: weak.’’ However, that panel did not
discuss whether this applied equally to patients who are or
are not likely to receive PMRT.
Some clinicians question the need for ALND after
mastectomy in women based on extrapolation of the find-
ings from three trials that randomly assigned patients with
positive sentinel nodes to undergo ALND or no further
axillary surgery. The ACOSOG (American College of
44
A. Recht et al.
 Surgeons Oncology Group) Z0011 trial included 856
patients
with
one
or
two
sentinel
node
micro-
or
macrometastases undergoing breast-conserving therapy,
including whole-breast irradiation.61,62 At a median follow-
up of 6.3 years, there was no difference between patients
allocated to ALND or no ALND with regard to locore-
gional recurrence or survival. A small percentage of
patients underwent axillary irradiation in violation of the
protocol, but the effect of this on outcome is not known.63
The IBCSG (International Breast Cancer Study Group)
23-01 trial included 931 women with one or two sentinel
node micrometastases; those with macrometastases were
excluded.64 Similar to the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, patients
were randomly assigned to undergo SNB alone or com-
pletion ALND. Patients who had undergone mastectomy
were eligible and constituted 9 % of the study population
(84 patients). Breast irradiation without nodal irradiation
was administered to 81 % of those treated with breast-
conserving surgery, but PMRT was not administered to
those who had undergone mastectomy. This trial also
showed no difference in rate of regional or distant failure
between the arms at a median follow-up of 5 years. Of
note, there were no regional nodal recurrences in 42
patients treated with mastectomy who did not receive
PMRT or ALND. Finally, the EORTC (European Organi-
sation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) 0981-22023
trial AMAROS [After Mapping of the Axilla, Radiotherapy
or Surgery]) compared ALND with breast plus axillary
irradiation in 1,525 women with one or two sentinel node
micro- or macrometastases.65 Most had undergone breast-
conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation, but 18 %
of the participants had undergone mastectomy, of whom
approximately one third had also received chest wall irra-
diation. There were no significant differences in any
measure of recurrence or mortality at a median follow-up
of 6.1 years. Rates of nodal failure in the patients who had
undergone mastectomy were not separately reported for
this trial. However, in both studies, the total number of
women treated with mastectomy was small.
Hence, at present, some physicians feel that ALND can
be omitted for patients undergoing mastectomy who have
similar findings on SNB to those of patients eligible for the
randomized trials, particularly if PMRT is administered,
whereas others feel ALND should still be performed.
Although there are insufficient data to support or refute
these opinions, the panel agreed that it is inappropriate to
subject patients to the potential acute and long-term toxi-
cities of PMRT (including rare but potentially fatal second
cancers and cardiac events) without careful consideration
of whether these are justified compared with the potential
toxicities of ALND. The decision as to how to integrate
ALND and PMRT for an individual patient should be a
multidisciplinary
effort
that
considers
the
treatment
program as a whole. Thus, PMRT should be administered
if there is otherwise sufficient evidence to warrant its use
when ALND is omitted and the potential toxicities of
PMRT are felt to be justified, and ALND should be used
when the totality of the evidence is not yet sufficient for
administering PMRT. That is, clinicians should ask them-
selves: ‘‘Would I recommend PMRT for this patient if she
had undergone simultaneous ALND, and there were no
additional nodal metastases in the nonsentinel nodes?’’ If
the answer is no, ALND should be performed. This dis-
cussion should ideally occur before surgery, especially
because this could guide patient decision making about
reconstruction choices if reconstruction is desired.
Clinical Question 3
Is PMRT indicated in patients with clinical stage I or II
cancers who have received NAST?
Updated Recommendation
Patients with axillary nodal
involvement that persists after NAST (eg, less than a
complete pathologic response) should receive PMRT.
Observational data suggest a low risk of locoregional
recurrence for patients who have clinically negative nodes
and receive NAST or who have a complete pathologic
response in the lymph nodes with NAST. However, there is
currently insufficient evidence to recommend whether
PMRT should be administered or can be routinely
omitted in these groups. The panel recommends entering
eligible patients in clinical trials that examine this question
(type: informal consensus; evidence quality: low; strength
of recommendation: weak).
Literature

Analysis
Neoadjuvant

was
initially
limited
to
patients
with

disease
to
allow
mastectomy
to
be
performed.
Such
patients
then
generally received PMRT. Whether PMRT is indicated in
women with resectable early-stage breast cancer who have
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy
is an issue of increasing importance. There are few studies
of the risks of LRF in such patients in relation to either pre-
or post-treatment clinical and pathologic features.66–69 The
interpretation of these data are further complicated by the
varying use of axillary ultrasound and biopsy before
initiation of systemic therapy to enhance detection of
clinically
positive
nodes
before
NAST
and
by
the
downstaging of nodal status by NAST (ie, a complete
pathologic response in an individual with pre-NAST
positive nodes that were detected on imaging only). The
influence of potential risk factors for LRF may be different
in patients undergoing NAST and those undergoing surgery
before systemic therapy.
Postmastectomy Radiotherapy
45
 The panel agrees that, on the basis of currently avail-
able data, patients with persistently involved nodes on
ALND after NAST have a sufficiently high risk of LRF to
recommend that they receive PMRT, although there are as
yet no data from randomized trials showing the effect of
such treatment on long-term breast cancer mortality rates.
Rates of LRF in patients with residual invasive cancer in
the breast but negative axillary nodes after NAST are
inconsistent across studies. Although patients with no
residual disease in either the breast or axillary nodes seem
to have low rates of LRF, there are insufficient data to
exclude the possibility that certain subgroups of these
patients may still benefit from PMRT (eg, those who had
biopsy-proven
axillary
nodal
involvement
before
chemotherapy or those with tumors with aggressive bio-
logic features). Hence, the panel did not believe that
recommendations for or against the use of PMRT could
be made with confidence for these latter two groups at
this time. The panel recommends entering these patients
in clinical trials if available. There are currently two
ongoing major multicenter trials in North America for
patients with biopsy-proven axillary node involvement
before NAST. The NRG Oncology Group 9353 trial,
which opened in August 2013, randomly allocates patients
with positive axillary fine-needle aspiration cytology or
core biopsy before chemotherapy who undergo mastec-
tomy or breast-conserving surgery and have negative
nodes on ALND or SNB to either no irradiation or PMRT
including the chest wall or reconstructed breast and RNI
(if they undergo mastectomy) or breast irradiation or
breast plus RNI (if they undergo breast-conserving sur-
gery; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01872975). The
Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology A011202 trial
addresses another question relevant to patients undergoing
NAST, namely, whether patients with a positive SNB
after chemotherapy have a different outcome when treated
with ALND or axillary radiation therapy without addi-
tional surgery (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01901
094). Unfortunately, there are no such trials for patients
without biopsy-proven nodal involvement before NAST
who are found to have pathologically negative axillary
nodes after NAST.
Clinical Question 4
Should RNI include both the IMNs and supraclavicular-
axillary apical nodes when PMRT is used in patients with
T1-2 tumors with one to three positive axillary nodes?
Updated
Recommendation
The
panel
recommends
treatment generally be administered to both the IMNs
and the supraclavicular-axillary apical nodes in addition to
the chest wall or reconstructed breast when PMRT is used
for patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. There may
be subgroups that will experience limited, if any, benefits
from treating both these nodal areas compared with treating
only one or perhaps treating only the chest wall or
reconstructed breast. There is insufficient evidence at this
time to define such subgroups in detail. Additional research
is needed to identify them (type: informal consensus;
evidence
quality:
intermediate;
strength
of
recommendation: moderate).
Literature Review and Analysis
The panel agreed the
critical question to address in this update should be whether
to administer PMRT or not and not to focus on issues of
what areas should be treated or how to deliver treatment.
However, the panel also deemed it necessary to discuss the
issue of RNI in patients with one to three positive nodes in
view of the recent publications of the French, Canadian,
and European prospective randomized trials and a large
Danish retrospective study on this topic.25–27,70
The minimum mandatory target volumes for PMRT that
were agreed upon by the panel are the chest wall and
supraclavicular-axillary apical nodes in current practice.
There remains controversy over when the IMNs and level I
and II axillary nodes should be deliberately included. The
radiation fields in 20 of the 22 trials in the EBCTCG meta-
analysis showing benefit with PMRT included the IMNs,
usually with additional regional nodes.5
Two randomized trials, conducted by the Canadian
Cancer Trials Group (previously the National Cancer
Institute of Canada) and the EORTC evaluated the addition
of irradiation of the supraclavicular nodes, axillary apical
nodes, and IMNs to whole-breast irradiation after breast-
conserving surgery (both trials) or after chest wall or no
chest wall irradiation after mastectomy (in the EORTC trial
only).26,27
A
randomized
trial
conducted
in
France
addressed the question of the addition of IMN irradiation to
chest wall, supraclavicular, and axillary apical nodal irra-
diation.25 All three trials included patients with node-
positive and node-negative breast cancers. Finally, a non-
randomized study from Denmark compared results in node-
positive patients with right-sided cancers who, according to
Danish national guidelines, were to receive IMN irradiation
in addition to the breast or chest wall and supraclavicular-
infraclavicular nodes with results in patients with left-sided
cancers, who were not to undergo IMN irradiation.70
Overall findings of these four studies are summarized in
Table 3. All found 1 %–5 % reductions in rates of relapse
and breast cancer-specific and overall mortalities in
patients receiving more extensive irradiation. Some of
these differences were statistically significant (eg, overall
survival in the EORTC and Danish studies).
46
A. Recht et al.
 Together, these studies support the effectiveness of RNI.
However, their interpretation is complicated by differences
in their exact design and in their detailed findings. For
example, the French trial included only patients treated
with mastectomy; the Canadian trial included only those
undergoing breast-conserving surgery; and the EORTC
trial mainly included patients treated with breast-conserv-
ing surgery, but 24 % of patients were treated with
mastectomy. All three randomized trials included patients
with negative axillary nodes, but the proportions in each
trial were different (25 %, 10 %, and 44 % in the French,
Canadian, and EORTC trials, respectively). Any patient
with negative nodes with a central- or inner-quadrant pri-
mary was eligible for the French and EORTC trials,
whereas only node-negative patients with high-risk features
were eligible for the Canadian trial (tumor C5 cm, tumor
C2 cm with B10 axillary nodes removed, estrogen receptor
(ER) negative, histologic grade 3, or lymphovascular
invasion present). In the EORTC trial, patients who had
undergone mastectomy underwent RNI versus no RNI
according to random allocation; chest wall irradiation was
administered at the discretion of the treating physicians.
The use of systemic therapy and radiation field guidelines
and techniques also varied. For example, the IMNs in the
first five intercostal spaces were included in the French
trial, the first three intercostal spaces in the Canadian trial,
and the first three intercostal spaces in the EORTC trial,
except for patients with lower inner-quadrant tumors, in
whom the first five intercostal spaces could be included.
Finally, all patients in the French trial underwent supra-
clavicular-infraclavicular
nodal
irradiation,
with
IMN
irradiation being randomly assigned. However, the MA.20
and EORTC trials assigned patients to irradiation of both
the supraclavicular-infraclavicular area and IMN nodes or
to no nodal irradiation, so the effects of treating these two
sites could not be separately evaluated.
Mindful
of
the
limitations
of
subgroup
analyses,
reporting of results also differed substantially among these
trials, particularly with regard to plausible prognostic or
predictive factors. The French trial did not report results for
patients with one to three positive nodes separately from
those with more involved nodes. Crude rates of any breast
cancer event were reduced from 20 % to 16 % in the
MA.20 trial and from 33 % to 30 % in the EORTC trial
with the addition of RNI, with respective reductions in
overall death rates of 1 % and 2 %. However, there was no
difference in overall survival at 8 years (83 %) between the
two groups in the Danish study (subgroup treatment
interactions were not reported). Results in relation to
receptor status were reported only for the MA.20 trial. Ten-
year disease-free survival rates in the control and RNI arms
for patients with ER-positive tumors were 79 % and 81 %,
respectively,
which
were
not
significantly
different;
10-year overall survival rates were 84 % in both arms.
However, for patients with ER-negative tumors, 10-year
disease-free survival rates were significantly different in
the control and RNI arms (71 % and 82 %, respectively);
10-year overall survival rates were 74 % and 81 %,
respectively. The EORTC trial found no difference in death
rates between the control and RNI arms when chemother-
apy alone was used (28 % and 30 %, respectively) or in
patients not receiving systemic therapy (14 % and 13 %,

 respectively). However, although there was no significant
difference in mortality with the addition of RNI for patients
receiving endocrine therapy alone (a reduction from 21 %
to 18 %), there was a statistically significant reduction in
patients receiving both endocrine therapy and chemother-
apy (from 20 % to 15 %). It is not yet clear whether these
different results in different subgroups resulted from
chance alone or reflect important clinical distinctions.
The consensus of the panel, on the basis of the EBCTCG
meta-analysis and the Canadian and EORTC RNI trials, is
that both the IMN and supraclavicular-axillary apical areas
should generally be treated when PMRT is used. However,
certain subgroups may experience limited benefit from
such treatment, and as noted, treating the supraclavicular
and IMN areas can result in additional toxicities, with
pulmonary and cardiac morbidities being particular con-
cerns
even
with
improved
radiotherapy
techniques.
Additional analyses of these trials and other studies are
needed to determine which patients should undergo irra-
diation of only one or neither of these areas.
In general, the full axilla is not irradiated in those who
have had ALND, because recurrence in the dissected axilla
is rare, and its inclusion may further increase toxicities,
particularly lymphedema.71 However, there are circum-
stances where full axillary irradiation may be considered,
such as when ALND is not performed or after ALND in
cases with extensive bulky involvement. There are insuf-
ficient data to propose recommendations in this area at
present.
DISCUSSION
The panel recommends strongly that input from all
clinicians as well as the patient is needed to yield the best
results from PMRT. This is best achieved through discus-
sion among providers early in the patient’s treatment
course (before or soon after surgery and before or soon
after the initiation of systemic therapy), either in the con-
text of a formal tumor board or by referral to the surgical,
medical, and radiation oncologists caring for the patient.
Patients vary in how much they wish to participate in
decision making, but ultimately, their values determine
whether the potential long-term benefits of PMRT are
sufficient to outweigh potential short- and long-term risks
of adverse effects.
