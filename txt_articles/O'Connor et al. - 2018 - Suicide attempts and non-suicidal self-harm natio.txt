Background
There are few prevalence studies of suicide attempts and non-
suicidal self-harm (NSSH).
Aims
We aimed to estimate the prevalence of thoughts of NSSH, sui-
cidal thoughts, NSSH and suicide attempts among 18- to 34-year-
olds in Scotland.
Method
We interviewed a representative sample of young adults from
across Scotland.
Results
We interviewed 3508 young people; 11.3 and 16.2% reported a
lifetime history of suicide attempts and NSSH, respectively. The
first episode of NSSH tended to precede the first suicide attempt
by about 2 years. Age at onset of NSSH and suicide attempt was
younger in females. Earlier age at onset was associated with
more frequent NSSH/suicide attempts. Women are significantly
more likely to report NSSH and suicide attempts compared with
men.
Conclusions
One in nine young people has attempted suicide and one in six
has engaged in NSSH. Clinicians should be vigilant, as suicide
attempts and NSSH are relatively common.
Declaration of interest

Suicide attempts and self-harm are major public health concerns
associated with death by suicide.1–5 Despite the increased focus
on these phenomena, there is still a lack of consensus about how
best to conceptualise them. Some argue that self-harm with
suicide intent (i.e. a suicide attempt) is distinct from self-harm
without suicidal intent (i.e. non-suicidal self-injury, NSSI or non-
suicidal self-harm, NSSH), whereas others argue that the motives
underpinning self-harm are multiple and fluid, and others still
view them as being on a continuum.2,6–11 In this study, we aimed
to investigate the prevalence of suicide attempts and NSSH
separately and together.
Prevalence rates
Although the rates of suicide are recorded internationally,12–15
nationally representative studies of the prevalence of suicide attempts
and NSSH remain scarce. Among adolescents in the USA, the preva-
lence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts is estimated to be
12.1 and 4.1%, respectively.16 Data from the World Mental Health
Surveys across 17 countries suggest the cross-national prevalence
of suicidal ideation is 9.2% and suicide attempts to be 2.7%.17 The
European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders reported
the adult lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts
to be 7.8 and 1.3%, respectively.18 In Germany, the lifetime preva-
lence of NSSI was found to be 3.1% in a nationally representative
sample.19 In England, the most recent Adult Psychiatric
Morbidity Survey (APMS) found that, across their lifetimes,
20.6% of respondents had thought about taking their own life,
6.7% had made a suicide attempt and 7.3% had engaged in self-
harm without suicidal intent.20,21 The APMS is one of the only
nationally representative large-scale studies to report the preva-
lence of NSSH as well as suicide attempts (see also Mars et al.8).
For the most part, large-scale research has focused on school-based
studies of adolescent self-harm22–24 and monitoring or register-based/
linkage studies of hospital-treated self-harm.25–29 Although both types
of studies are important, the adolescent findings cannot be general-
ised to older age groups and the hospital-linkage studies tell us little
about suicide attempts and NSSH in the community. Indeed, given
that the majority of people who think about or attempt suicide do
not receive treatment,30 the generalisability of hospital-based
studies is limited. To address these evidence gaps, we conducted
the Scottish Wellbeing Study, a nationally representative inter-
view-based survey of young adults aged 18–34 years. We targeted
the 18- to 34-year-old age group because although suicide attempts
and NSSH seem to be common among young adults,17,31 we know
relatively little about their prevalence in this age group.
Current study
This is the first nationally representative population-based prevalence
study of suicide attempts and NSSH in young adults ever conducted
in the UK. As Scotland has a higher suicide rate than England32 but
both have similar rates of adolescent self-harm,33,34 it is important to
establish whether the rates of suicide attempts and NSSH diverge in
young adulthood. Given that some individuals engage in both beha-
viours, we also recorded the prevalence of the cooccurrence of suicide
attempts and NSSH. In summary, this study aimed to estimate the
prevalence of thoughts of NSSH, suicidal thoughts, NSSH and
suicide attempts among 18- to 34-year-olds in Scotland.
Method
Study design, setting and participant recruitment
This is a cross-sectional study. Participant recruitment was con-
ducted by Ipsos MORI, a social research organisation. We recruited
a representative sample of young people aged 18–34 years from
across Scotland to the Scottish Wellbeing Study. We employed a

 quota sampling methodology, with quotas based on age (three quota
groups), gender and working status. Full details of the sampling
design are provided in Appendix 1. It is now argued that a quota
sampling design results in a sample with comparable quality to
that achieved with a probability sample.35 After providing written
consent, participants completed a 1 hour-long interview, carried
out face-to-face in their homes, using computer-assisted personal
interviewing and including a computer-assisted self-interviewing
module (the questions about suicide attempts and NSSH were
completed confidentially on the computer). The participants com-
pleted other psychological and social measures; however, only the
prevalence of NSSH and suicide attempts information is reported
here. All interviewers were trained in the administration of the mea-
sures. Ethical approval was obtained from the Department of
Psychology Ethics Committee at the University of Stirling and the
US Department of Defense, Human Research Protections Office.
Participants received £25 in compensation for taking part. All par-
ticipants were given a list of support organisations at the end of the
interview.
Measures
Suicide attempts and NSSH
Suicide attempts and NSSH were assessed via the following ques-
tions, taken from the APMS, respectively20: ‘Have you ever made
an attempt to take your life, by taking an overdose of tablets or in
some other way?’ and ‘Have you ever deliberately harmed yourself
in any way but not with the intention of killing yourself? (i.e. self-
harm)’. The questions about self-injurious thoughts were adapted
from the APMS and the Child and Adolescent Self-harm in Europe
study.22 Presence of suicidal thoughts was determined as follows:
‘Have you ever seriously thought of taking your life, but not actually
attempted to do so?’ and respondents completed the following NSSH
thoughts question: ‘Have you ever seriously thought about trying to
deliberately harm yourself but not with the intention of killing your-
self but not actually done so?’. If respondents answered yes to either
suicide attempts or NSSH, timing of last episode, frequency and age at
first onset were asked.
We also report the demographic characteristics (gender, age,
marital status, economic activity, ethnicity and accommodation)
of the sample here.
Statistical analysis
Logistic regression analyses, Mann–Whitney U, correlations and
chi-square analyses were used to investigate the association
between prevalence and characteristics of suicide attempts and
NSSH and demographic factors, as appropriate. We also present
prevalence ratios to highlight demographic differences. Although
it has been argued that error estimates (confidence intervals)
cannot be used in quota sampling (because it does not adhere to
classical sampling theory), other modelling-based approaches
have found that sampling errors are essentially the same as via the
classical approach and are reported herein.35,36
Weighting
The data were weighted to ensure that the achieved sample on the
quota variables was in line with the population in the sample
frame by random iterative method weighting. Overall, as the
quotas were almost always met (30- to 34-year-olds, full-time stu-
dents and full-time workers were slightly underrepresented in the
unweighted profile compared with the target profile) the effect of
the weights was small, with the weights ranging from 0.81 to 1.30
(therefore the weights would only increase the standard errors of
estimates by 1%, see Appendix 1). All analyses were conducted
with the weights on.
Missing data
As the data were collected via interview, most of the missing data
were limited to participants declining to answer a question by select-
ing ‘would rather not say’. There were very few respondents with
missing data on the lifetime NSSH (n = 39, 1.1%) or suicide attempts
(n = 43, 1.2%) variables. In a small number of cases (n = 5) where a
respondent indicated history of NSSH or suicide attempts but had
missing data on the other variable, this was included as NSSH
only or suicide attempt only (for the completed variable).
Obviously, there is the possibility that these people had engaged
in both behaviours, but we do not know for certain.
Results
Sample and participant characteristics
A total of 3508 young people were interviewed between 25 March
2013 and 12 December 2013. Over half (50.6%) of the respondents
were male and 37.0% were aged 18–23 years, with 35.9 and 27.1%
aged 24–29 and 30–34 years, respectively (see Table 1). The majority
of the sample was White (93.8%) and 83% of participants were not
married. Just over half were in full-time employment, one in five was
(19.1%) in full-time education and 10% were unemployed. A total of
49.5% of participants lived in rental accommodation, with the
majority of the remainder either owning their own home (24.1%)
or living with parents/relatives (23.3%).
Prevalence of suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, self-
harm thoughts and self-harm
Overall, 11.3 and 16.2% of the total sample reported a lifetime
history of suicide attempts and NSSH, respectively (see Table 2).
More than 20% reported lifetime suicidal thoughts, 2.4% reported
that they last thought about suicide in the past week and 10.4%
reported they last thought about suicide in the past 12 months.
Further, 16% reported thoughts of NSSH at some stage in their
lives, 1.7% reported that they last thought about NSSH in the past
week and 7.3% reported they last thought about NSSH in the past
12 months. Very few respondents (0.3%) reported that they had
last attempted suicide in the past week and 2.7% reported their
last attempt in the past 12 months. Approximately 1% (1.1%) of
respondents reported that their last NSSH episode was in the
past week with 4.8% reported their most recent episode within the
past 12 months (all of the past 12 month rates include the past
week rates).
Approximately 10% of respondents (9.8%; 95% CI = 8.9–10.8%)
engaged in NSSH only, 4.8% (95% CI = 4.2–5.6%) had attempted
suicide only and 6.5% (95% CI = 5.7–7.3%) had attempted suicide
and engaged in NSSH (the ‘both’ group). Of those who had
attempted suicide, 57.3% had also engaged in NSSH and of those
who reported NSSH, 39.7% also had a suicide attempt history.
Approximately 60% (60.8%) of those who have attempted
suicide reported doing so more than once (range: 1–75 times,
mean: 3.52 (s.d. = 7.23), median: 2) and 80% of those with an
NSSH history had harmed themselves more than once (range: 1–
99 times, mean: 9.39 (s.d. = 16.23), median: 4). The age at onset of
the first episode of NSSH (mean: 16.05 (s.d. = 4.12), range: 5–32
years, median: 15 years) was younger than that for age at first
suicide attempt (mean: 17.81 (s.d. = 4.99), range: 6–34 years,
median: 17 years). Age at onset for first NSSH episode was signifi-
cantly older in men (median: 16 years, mean: 16.56 (s.d. = 4.23),
range: 6–29 years) compared with women (median: 15 years,
Suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm
143
 mean: 15.77 (s.d. = 4.04), range: 5–32 years; Z = −2.64, P = 0.008).
A similar gender × age association for first suicide attempt was also
evident (median: 18 years, mean: 18.29 (s.d. = 5.00), range: 6–34
years for men v. median: 16 years, mean: 17.5 (s.d. = 4.97), range:
6–33 years for women; Z = −2.62, P = 0.009), with women report-
ing first episodes of NSSH younger than men. For both NSSH and
suicide attempts, earlier age at onset was correlated with more fre-
quent episodes of NSSH (Spearman’s rho = −0.20, P < 0.001) and
suicide attempts (Spearman’s rho = −0.30, P < 0.001) in the
whole sample and for men (Spearman’s rho = −0.18, P = 0.018
for NSSH and Spearman’s rho = −0.23, P = 0.006 for suicide
attempts) and women separately (Spearman’s rho = −0.21, P <
0.001 for NSSH and Spearman’s rho = −0.33, P < 0.001 for
suicide attempts).
As detailed in Table 2, lifetime suicide attempts were reported
more often by women (13.8%) than men (8.8%; prevalence ratio,
1.02; odds ratio, 1.67; 95% CI = 1.35–2.07, P < 0.0001) and NSSH
was also more commonly reported by women (20.9%) than men
(11.6%; prevalence ratio, 1.80; odds ratio, 2.02; 95% CI = 1.68–
2.43, P < 0.0001). Similar numbers of men (22.6%) and women
(23.0%; prevalence ratio, 1.02; odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI = 0.87–
1.20, P = 0.80) reported suicidal thoughts across their lifetime
whereas thoughts of NSSH were more common in women (19.2 v.
12.3% for men; prevalence ratio, 1.56; odds ratio, 1.69; 95% CI =
1.40–2.04, P < 0.0001).
Prevalence of lifetime history of suicide attempts was signifi-
cantly lower among 18- to 23-year-olds, being 9% compared with
12.2% in 24- to 29-year-olds (prevalence ratio, 1.36; odds ratio,
1.40; 95% CI = 1.08–1.80, P = 0.010), with 30- to 34-year-olds
reporting similar rates of suicide attempts to the 24- to 29-year-
olds, at 13% (prevalence ratio, 1.07; odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI =
0.84–1.39, P = 0.564). Although the lifetime prevalence of self-
harm is similar in 18–23 (18.6%) and 24- to 29-year-olds (17.1%;
prevalence ratio, 0.92; odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI = 0.74–1.10,
P = 0.315), it is markedly lower among 30- to 34-year-olds com-
pared with 24- to 29-year-olds (11.7%; prevalence ratio, 0.68;
odds ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50–0.82, P < 0.0001). The age distribution
for female NSSH and suicide attempts mirrors that for the sample as
a whole, whereas male NSSH peaks in the 24- to 29-year-old age
group.
The sociodemographic characteristics as a function of lifetime
NSSH and suicide attempt histories are summarised in Table 3.
Not being married was associated with increased likelihood of
NSSH (17.4 v. 10.5% for not married and married, respectively;
prevalence ratio, 1.66; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI = 1.35–2.37,
P < 0.0001) but not of suicide attempts (11.7 v. 9.2% for not
married and married, respectively; prevalence ratio, 1.27; odds
ratio, 1.31; 95% CI = 0.97–1.78, P = 0.077; see Table 3). The preva-
lence of NSSH and suicide attempts was significantly higher
among those classified as unemployed (20.3%; prevalence ratio,
1.53; odds ratio, 1.67; 95% CI = 1.25–2.23, P < 0.0001 and 20.6%;
prevalence ratio, 2.24; odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI = 1.88–3.40,
P < 0.0001 for NSSH and suicide attempts, respectively) and eco-
nomically inactive (21.2%; prevalence ratio, 1.59; odds ratio, 1.76;
95% CI = 1.44–2.15, P < 0.0001 for NSSH and 12.3%; prevalence
ratio, 1.34; odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI = 1.09–1.76, P = 0.008 for
suicide attempts) compared with those who were employed
(13.3% for NSSH and 9.2% for suicide attempts). Ethnicity was
not associated with prevalence of NSSH or suicide attempts.
Compared with those who own their own home (10.3% reported
NSSH), those living in rental (19.1% reported NSSH; prevalence
ratio, 1.85; odds ratio, 2.06; 95% CI = 1.60–2.65, P < 0.0001) or
other accommodation (16.3% reported NSSH; prevalence ratio,
1.58; odds ratio, 1.70; 95% CI = 1.28–2.25, P < 0.0001) were
more likely to report NSSH. Those in rental accommodation
were also significantly more likely to report a suicide attempt

Discussion
Suicide attempts and NSSH are major public health concerns that
affect large numbers of young people. Eleven per cent of young
people aged 18–34 years report having attempted suicide and 16%
report having self-harmed without suicidal intent at some stage in
their lives. Women are 1.6 times more likely to report a suicide
attempt than men and 1.8 times more women reported NSSH com-
pared with men. Almost a quarter (22.8%) of young people also
reported lifetime suicidal thoughts. For NSSH and suicide attempts,
age at first episode tends to be during adolescence, with NSSH
(mean age: 16.05 years, s.d. = 4.12) occurring, on average, 2 years
earlier than suicide attempts (17.81 years, s.d. = 4.99). It is concern-
ing that the majority of respondents who engaged in NSSH (80%) or
suicide attempts (60%) did so more than once. Earlier age at NSSH
or suicide attempt onset was associated with more frequent lifetime
NSSH and suicide attempts and age at onset was younger in females
compared with males. Moreover, 6.5% of the sample had engaged in
both NSSH and attempted suicide at least once. Approximately 3%
(2.7%) and 5% (4.8%) of young people have attempted suicide and
engaged in NSSH, respectively, in the past 12 months. Among
the total sample, rates of NSSH were highest among the 18- to
23-year-old age group, whereas suicide attempt rates were most
common among the 30- to 34-year-olds. The same pattern was
evident in women, whereas NSSH was most common among
24- to 29-year-old men. One in five young adults who were classi-
fied as unemployed reported an NSSH and a suicide attempt
history, and another 20 and 12% of those who were economically
inactive reported NSSH and suicide attempts, respectively.
History of suicide attempts and NSSH was ascertained in the
same way in our study as in the English APMS.20 So, although the
raw data from the latter are not yet available, we used the published
APMS summary tables to compare the rates of suicide attempts and
NSSH in both countries. In the youngest age groups, the rates were
similar in Scotland and England (the prevalence rates of lifetime
suicide attempts in the Scottish Wellbeing Study (18- to 23-year-
olds) and in the APMS (16- to 24-year-olds) were both 9%; rates
of NSSH were 18.6 and 17.5% for Scotland and England, respect-
ively). However, lifetime rates of suicide attempts and NSSH were
higher in the Scottish sample among the older ages. Whereas the
rates of suicide attempts and NSSH among 24- to 34-year-olds
(we collapsed the 24- to 29-year-old and 30- to 34-year-old age
groups) in this study were 12.6 and 14.8%, respectively, the compar-
able rates in the APMS were 8.5 and 12.1% for 25- to 34-year-olds in
England. Given that the national suicide rates are higher in Scotland
compared with England,37 these suicide attempt data may suggest
that risk begins to diverge in the mid-twenties. Future research is
required to determine why the rates begin to diverge in this age
group; are there structural factors (which increase health inequal-
ities, for example) in Scotland compared with England that may
explain this age divergence? Caution is urged though, as the
APMS is an adult lifespan study whereas the Scottish Wellbeing
Study focused on young people specifically. Moreover, the APMS
included young people aged 16 years and over whereas the
Scottish Wellbeing Study was restricted to those who were at least
18 years old. It would be informative, therefore, to replicate the
Scottish Wellbeing Study in England to yield directly comparable
prevalence figures for young adults.
This study has many strengths (including large representative
sample,
being
interview-based
and
confidential
completion),
however, it is important torecognise that suicidal history was assessed
via self-report (albeit via computer) and, therefore, the responses
were subject to standard reporting biases. Consistent with other
large-scale surveys,20 it was not optimal that suicide attempts and
NSSH were assessed via single questions, although these specific
questions have been widely used. Also, given the evidence that
some people inconsistently report their self-harm/suicidal history,
reliance on self-report may lead to the underreporting of suicide
attempts and NSSH, therefore combining data from multiple
sources may more accurately reflect the actual prevalence of suicide

b Economic activity has been reduced to three categories based upon the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey data-set: employed (economically active people), unemployed (those out of
work but are available to start work) and economically inactive (including students, those looking after the home, long-term sick, disabled or retired).
c Ethnicity was collapsed into two ethnic groups (White versus Black and minority ethnic).
d Accommodation has been reduced to three categories: owns own home, rent (private rental and social housing) and other (lives with parents/relatives, other).

 attempts and NSSH.38 The use of quota sampling also requires
comment. Historically, quota sampling may have yielded a biased
sample (as non-responding individuals are ignored and the inter-
viewer is selecting people or households), however, it is now argued
that a rigorously designed quota sample (as conducted here) is as
good as a probability sample.35,39,40 This is the baseline wave of a lon-
gitudinal study, therefore, the incidence rates of suicide attempts and
NSSH over time will be reported in due course, as well as the associa-
tions with psychological risk and protective factors.
The findings are stark and clinically important as they highlight
the scale of suicide attempts and NSSH among 18- to 34-year-olds
and their demographic profile. Given that the vast majority of
respondents who reported NSSH and suicide attempt did so more
than once, clinicians should assess risk of repetition if a young
person presents with an index suicide attempt or NSSH episode.
Moreover, earlier onset of NSSH/suicide attempt is clinically signifi-
cant in particular given its association with more frequent NSSH/
suicide attempts. In such cases, clinicians should assess the factors
(e.g. impulsivity, exposure, suicidal imagery, fearlessness about
death, access to means) known to increase the likelihood that
thoughts of suicide and self-harm are acted upon.41–45 From a
public health perspective, the unemployment and economic inactivity
findings are noteworthy. However, as these data are from a retro-
spective study, the direction of the relationship between unemploy-
ment and economic inactivity and NSSH/suicide attempts is
unclear. Nonetheless, these findings are consistent with the extant
suicide research literature on health and social inequality and high-
light the importance of supporting those who are unemployed and
economically inactive.46
Psychiatrists, psychologists and others involved in the care of
young people should be vigilant. Given the prevalence of suicide
attempts and NSSH in this age group, they should routinely
enquire about history of self-injurious behaviour, especially as past
behaviour is such a strong predictor of suicide.3 In conclusion, both
NSSH and suicide attempts are common among young people in
Scotland, with at least one in nine reporting lifetime prevalence of
suicide attempts and one in six reporting NSSH, and 6.5% reporting
a history of both behaviours.
