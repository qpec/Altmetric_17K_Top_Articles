Mammalian wounds typically heal by fibrotic repair without hair follicle (HF) regeneration.
Fibrosis and regeneration are currently considered the opposite end of wound healing. This
study sought to determine if scar could be remodeled to promote healing with HF regen-
eration. Here, we identify that activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway reinstalls a
regenerative dermal niche, called dermal papilla, which is required and sufficient for HF
neogenesis (HFN). Epidermal Shh overexpression or constitutive Smoothened dermal acti-
vation results in extensive HFN in wounds that otherwise end in scarring. While long-term
Wnt activation is associated with fibrosis, Shh signal activation in Wnt active cells promotes
the dermal papilla fate in scarring wounds. These studies demonstrate that mechanisms of
scarring and regeneration are not distant from one another and that wound repair can be
redirected to promote regeneration following injury by modifying a key dermal signal.

 T
he hair follicle (HF) is a complex mini-organ that is formed
during embryonic development through communication
between follicular epithelial cells and underlying dermal
papilla cells (DP)1,2. DP cells constitute the dermal niche that
instructs hair follicle epithelial cell fate and differentiation3,4.
After embryonic follicular development, interactions between HF
resident stem cells (HFSCs) and the underlying DP continue to
regulate the cyclical regeneration of hair shafts in existing HFs
throughout the life of the organism5–7. However, the de novo
generation of HFs is rare in adult animals. Failure to regenerate
HFs that are lost from injury or disease represents a major
challenge in cutaneous regenerative medicine8,9 and can be lar-
gely traced to the resistance of adult mammals to resurrect
complex embryonic epithelial–mesenchymal interactions that
govern organogenesis.
Most adult mammalian tissues do not undergo regenerative
healing, a process that recreates a functional tissue nearly indis-
tinguishable from its original form10. However, healing of large
skin excisions in mice has been shown to recapitulate aspects of
true tissue regeneration in the formation of new HFs (HF neo-
genesis, HFN) thus providing a rare example of mammalian
epimorphic regeneration11–13. In contrast, small skin excisions in
mice result in the formation of scar tissue, or fibrosis, which is
composed largely of extracellular matrix components like col-
lagens and fibronectin and devoid of new accessory structures like
HFs11 (Supplementary Fig. 1a–g). Both large and small human
skin wounds incurred by trauma or dystrophy almost always
undergo fibrotic scarring.
As yet, the mediators that determine the balance between scar-
forming and regenerative skin wound healing are unknown. The
relationship between scarring and regeneration is currently elu-
sive. It is unknown whether scarring precludes regeneration,
whether scarring cells intrinsically lack the competence for
regeneration or whether regenerative cues are simply absent. In
this study, we reveal that Shh signaling plays a major role in
converting wound fibroblasts from scar promoting, to those that
stimulate HFN. Our study suggests that the absence of regen-
erative cues impacts the inability of hair follicle morphogenesis
after injuring the skin.
Results
Shh signaling is essential for wound-induced HF neogenesis. In
analyzing the disparate healing responses in large and small
wounds in adult mice, we found that Gli1 expression, a readout of
Hh pathway activation, was localized to the center of large
wounds, corresponding to regions of hair placode/germ forma-
tion. In striking contrast, it was absent from small wounds
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1h). The Gli1 signal in large
wounds localized to both DP and epithelial hair germ cells,
recapitulating the pattern observed in embryonic HF develop-
ment14. Moreover, Shh, a major ligand of the pathway, was
upregulated at the site of HFN in the epithelial compartment in
large wounds but absent from either epidermal or dermal com-
partment in small wounds (Fig. 1b, c).
Shh expression during hair follicle morphogenesis is conserved
between mice and humans15 and vital for hair follicle develop-
ment and hair cycle14,16–22. We asked if the absence of Hh
pathway activation in mouse small wounds might explain their
failure to undergo regenerative wound healing during wound
repair.
First, to understand the importance of epithelial Shh expres-
sion in large wounds, Shh was genetically deleted from epidermal
cells in healed large wounds of K14-CreER; Shh fl/fl mice upon
tamoxifen (TAM) induction from post wound (PW)3d to
PW21d. This resulted in a loss of DP and hair germ formation
compared to control mice (Fig. 1d–f). These results showed that
epithelial Shh ligands are essential for DP formation and HFN.
Additionally, deletion of Smo, an essential component of Shh
pathway activation, in underlying wound dermal cells in TAM-
treated Pdgfra-CreER; Smo fl/fl mice also resulted in inhibition of
DP formation and associated HFN events (Fig. 1g–j). Thus,
activation of the Shh signaling pathway in the wound dermis
plays a vital role in promoting DP formation.
Epithelial Shh leads to HF neogenesis in wounds. To determine
if Shh activation could induce HFN in scar-forming wounds, we
overexpressed Shh in epithelial cells in K14-CreER; LSL-Shh or
K14-CreER; LSL-Shh; Gli1-LacZ mice and examined HFN in
small wounds23. To induce Shh overexpression, TAM was
injected into control and K14-CreER; LSL-Shh or K14-CreER;
LSL-Shh; Gli1-LacZ mice from PW1d to indicated time points in
Fig. 2. This treatment resulted in extensive HFN in wounds
compared to control wounds (Fig. 2a, b). Epidermal Shh over-
expression resulted in Gli1 activation in both the epidermis and
dermis, corresponding to the areas of HFN. Shh-driven hair
germs expressed Lef1 and K17 and exhibited normal hair follicle
morphogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c, f–i). AP+ DPs were
associated with overlying K17+ epithelial buds as typically
observed in HFN (Supplementary Fig. 2d)11. Eventually, many of
these hair follicles (52 ± 16%, mean ± s.d.) grew downward to
form mature hair follicles with hair shafts, an event rarely
observed in control small wounds (Supplementary Fig. 2e). New
DP expressed Lef1 and Noggin as well as AP, further demon-
strating their DP identity (Supplementary Fig. 2f)24,25. We rarely
found aberrant basaloid growths resembling superficial basal-cell
carcinomas (BCCs) in these wounds.
Previous studies noted that HFN in large wounds in WT mice
was limited to the central area of the wounds11. Given the ability
of Shh to induce ectopic HFN in small wounds, we asked if
exogenous Shh might overcome the inability of new hair follicles
to form outside this central region in large wounds. In large
wounds from TAM-treated K14-CreER; LSL-Shh mice, we
observed extensive DP formation covering the entire wound area
compared with TAM-treated controls. (Fig. 2c–e). These results
verify the potency of Shh activation to overcome regional
inhibition of HFN.
To characterize changes in gene expression following Shh
overexpression, TAM was administered into control and K14-
CreER; LSL-Shh mice from PW1d to PW11d and wound cells
isolated for RNA-seq analyses. Epidermal and dermal cells from
TAM-treated control and K14-CreER; LSL-Shh mice were
compared by RNA-seq analyses (Fig. 2f, g and Table 1 and
Supplementary Fig. 3). Gene ontology (GO) analyses showed
that processes and signatures involved in embryonic HF
morphogenesis, including cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and
Hh signaling1, were enriched by Shh overexpression (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3a, c). There was no significant difference in
expression of Fgf9, which is known to promote hair follicle
neogenesis in a large wound model, either in the epidermis
(FDR:0.64) or dermis (FDR:0.97) of K14-CreER; LSL-Shh mice
compared to controls. Most notably, there was upregulation of
the Shh signaling pathway in both the epithelial cells and dermal
cells. We also noted upregulation of DP signature genes Bmp7,
Enpp2, lamc3, and Trps1 in the wound dermis and hair placode
signature genes, including Trp73, Vwa2, Samd5, Cxcl14, Nedd9,
and Tnfaip3 in the wound epidermis of Shh overexpressed mice
(Supplementary Fig. 3b, d)26. These data were confirmed by
qPCR analyses (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). These results suggest
that epidermal Shh overexpression can induce key embryonic
signatures of HF morphogenesis.

 Epithelial Shh regenerates HFs without altering neighboring
collagen. Although the increased collagen I deposition by adult
dermal fibroblasts vs. fetal fibroblasts during wound healing is
well-established, whether the low level of collagen I is essential for
embryonic/neonatal non-scarring healing is currently unknown.
Our RNA-seq suggests that epithelial Shh overexpression did not
significantly change the overall extracellular matrix composition
of the wound dermis towards an embryonic state. The increased
ratio of type III versus type I collagen is a key characteristic of
fetal scarless wound healing27–30, and expressions of the genes
encoding these collagens were unchanged (FDR: 0.99 for Col1a1,
Col1a2, and Col3a1) (Table 1). This was verified by biochemical
measurement for the content of hydroxyproline, a major com-
ponent of collagen (Fig. 2h). In addition, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis of the wound area showed no change
in collagen fiber diameter due to Shh overexpression, which is
directly proportional to the tensile strength31 (Fig. 2i). Con-
sistently, no significant differences were noted in the histological

 assessments for collagen staining (i.e., Masson trichrome and
Picrosirius red staining) before and after the formation of neo-
genic hair follicles (Fig. 2j, k). We found that the epithelial Shh
expression and the reduction of type I collagen in the neighboring
wound scar does not play a significant role in Shh-driven HF
neogenesis. The data suggests that DP and hair follicles were
forming within the scar of the wounds.
Dermal Hh activation induces HF neogenesis in scarring
wounds. To ask if direct Shh pathway activation of myofibroblasts
in the small wound dermis would also promote DP formation and
HFN, we induced expression of the activated form of Smo under
the control of the SM22α promoter, known to be specifically active
only in dermal myofibroblasts (SM22-rtTA; tetO-Cre; R26-SmoM2)
(Fig. 3a)32–34. In the transgenic mice, constitutively active Smo
expression is dependent on doxycycline (dox) administration.
Expression of the activated form of Smo in myofibroblasts
during wounding (dox treatment from PW1d to PW30d) or fol-
lowing re-epithelialization (dox treatment from PW10 ± 2d to
PW46d) resulted in DP formation within small wounds of
SM22-SmoM2 mice compared to control mice (Fig. 3b, c

 and Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Constitutive Hh activation in
wound myofibroblasts from SM22-SmoM2 mice also resulted in
striking changes in wound epithelial cells. Those epithelial cells
directly above Smo-active DP expressed K17 and Shh, well-
established hair germ markers (Fig. 3d, e, i and Supplementary
Fig. 4a, c, 6a). Additionally, these hair germ cells displayed
nuclear β-catenin and Lef1 expression indicating active Wnt
signaling, a known signature of hair follicle development and
growth (Fig. 3h, j-m)11,35. A significant number of new hair
follicles were also observed with differentiated hair shafts (28
±7%) containing both outer root sheath (AE13+ hair cortex,
AE15+ medulla)36,37, and inner root sheath (AE15+)37 struc-
tures, stem cell compartments (K15+CD34+)38,39, hair matrix
cells (Shh+) (Fig. 3g, n and Supplementary Fig. 5). Neogenic hair
follicles also maintained an adjoining dermal sheath (SMA+,
SM22α+)40, biochemically distinct from DP (Noggin+)25 (Sup-
plementary Fig. 5). We also frequently observed AP+ DP struc-
tures without accompanying hair germs despite their close
proximity to overlying epidermis (Fig. 3j). Indeed, there were
almost twice as many AP+ DP as K17+ hair germs, suggesting
that
many
DP
(42±15%)
formed
without
establishing
epithelial–mesenchymal interactions that could promote HF
morphogenesis (Fig. 3f). DP formation without hair germ for-
mation is not observed in normal endogenous hair follicle
development in embryo or in adult large wounds11. These
regenerative events were observed following wound closure.
Intriguingly, even in the experiments where we induced Hh
activation early during wound healing, the time of wound closure,
proliferation, epidermal differentiation, AP distribution, angio-
genesis and infiltration of immune cells including macrophages
into the wound site were not altered prior to wound closure
(Supplementary Fig. 6b-i).
Hh activation shifts dermal fibroblast fate toward DP. To
understand whether SM22+ dermal cells universally induce the
DP fate upon Hh activation, we isolated Tomato+ cells from
wound dermis of SM22-rtTA; tetO-Cre; R26-SmoM2/Tomato
(SM22-SmoM2) and SM22-rtTA; tetO-Cre; R26-Tomato (control)
mice 3 days after complete re-epithelialization (dox treatment
from PW1d to PW12d) and compared their molecular signatures
by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Fig. 4). We per-
formed unsupervised clustering with K means based on differ-
entially expressed genes (DEGs), using tSNE (t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding). Based on expression of lineage
markers for different cell types, we identified cellular clusters of
fibroblasts, muscle cells, schwann cells, endothelial cells and
immune cells (Fig. 4a–f)41–44. Examination of Hh pathway
mediators Gli1, Gli2, Ptch1, and Ptch2 showed that Hh pathway
components were mainly expressed in the fibroblast cluster
(Fig. 4g) and were largely restricted to the SM22-SmoM2 group
(Fig. 4h, i). This is consistent with the lack of Gli1-lacZ expres-
sion in the wild-type dermis of small wounds (Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Fig. 1h). The Hh-active fibroblast clusters
showed upregulation of DP signature genes including Hey1,
Sema6a, Wif1, Cxcr4, Ggta1, Hck, Snrpn and Rasd1 as previously
defined by several groups (Fig. 4j)26,45–48, suggesting that Hh
activation in SM22+ myofibroblasts are sufficient to globally
induce upregulation of DP signature genes. Nonetheless, within
this Hh-activated fibroblast population, we identified a diver-
gence in the number and level of DP signature genes (Hh-active I
and II), suggesting that Hh-independent mechanisms are also
involved in the regulation of DP signature genes. For example,
while the upregulation of Bmp3 and Plk2, known DP signature
genes, was widely observed among Hh-active fibroblasts (Hh-
active I and II), expression of Alpl (AP) and Lef1, vital markers
for DP identification in histochemical analyses, was limited to a
small subpopulation of Hh-active fibroblasts (Hh-active II)
(Fig. 4j).
Hh activation in wound epidermis forms BCC-like structure.
In contrast to dermis-specific activation of the Hh pathway,
forced Hh activation solely in epithelial cells (K14-CreER; R26-
SmoM2, TAM administration from PW1d to PW30d) did not
promote DP formation in the wound area (Supplementary Fig. 7).

 As previously observed, the epidermis of these wounds main-
tained numerous K17+ epithelial invaginations resembling BCCs
without signs of hair follicle differentiation49–51. Also, the Hh-
driven, BCC-like epithelial growths were not accompanied by
underlying DP52.
Hh activation converts Wnt-active wound fibroblasts into DP.
Next, given that Wnt signaling plays an essential role in hair
follicle development and neogenesis11,53–56, we sought to examine
the relationship between Wnt and Shh signaling. Our scRNA-seq

 in wounds from Axin2-LacZ mice both showed Wnt activity in
scarring dermis of small wounds. scRNA-seq analyses demon-
strated the expression of Axin2, Wls, and canonical Wnt ligands
such as Wnt2 and Wnt10a (Fig. 5a, b). Our findings are consistent
with previous reports that long-term Wnt signaling within dermal
fibroblasts correlates with injury-induced fibrosis57,58. We hypo-
thesized that dermal Wnt signaling is not sufficient to induce HFN
without Hh activation. Indeed, constitutive activation of Wnt

 signaling (SM22-rtTA; tetO-Cre; β-catenin ex3/fl) in SM22+ dermal
cells of small wounds did not promote new DP regeneration or
HFN (Fig. 5c–h). However, dermal depletion of Wls, which is
essential for Wnt ligand secretion, inhibited HFN in large wounds
(SM22-rtTA; tetO-Cre; Wls fl/fl and dox treatment from PW3d to
PW21d). These results suggest the requirement of dermal Wnt
ligands for HFN (Fig. 5i–l).
We then sought to test whether Hh activation in dermal cells
was capable of converting Wnt-active dermal fibroblasts to the
DP fate. We induced forced Hh activation in Wnt responsive cells
within small wounds, using the promoter of Axin2, a well-
established target of canonical Wnt activity59,60 (Axin2-CreER;
R26-SmoM2). TAM was administered into control and Axin2-
CreER; R26-SmoM2 from PW1d to PW30d. Smo overexpression
in Wnt-active myofibroblasts resulted in extensive DP formation
in small wounds (Fig. 6a–d). Genetic tracing of Axin2+ cells
during HFN in reporter Axin2-CreER; R26-Tomato mice showed
tomato expression in de novo DPs establishing that Axin2+ cells
in wounds form DPs (Fig. 6e). In contrast, control wounds
without Hh activation in Wnt-active dermal cells underwent
scarring without HFN (Fig. 6a–d). These results show that Hh
activation in Wnt-active dermal cells promotes their fate
conversion into DP, the regenerative dermal niche for HF
formation.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that wound repair can be redirected to
promote regeneration following injury by modifying a key dermal
signal (Fig. 6f). This study provides definitive evidence for a long-
held concept that dermal cells are key components in determining
wound healing outcome8. Our results suggest that the suppres-
sion of skin appendage regeneration in wound healing is due to
the absence of dermal regeneration signals rather than intrinsic
lack of regenerative competence in scarring cells. Installing
developmental signals in the wound dermis may be a reasonable
strategy to achieve regenerative healing in mammals. Epithelial
activation of Wnt and Shh signaling was previously identified as
critical for hair regeneration; however, these same pathways may
also induce skin epithelial cancers when experimentally or
pharmacologically augmented61,62. Our basic study with pre-
clinical mouse models suggests that the capacity to create ectopic
de novo DP in vivo by modulation of specific signals in the
dermis may overcome this barrier and bring us closer to true skin
renewal after injury.
Fibrotic scarring and epimorphic regeneration are frequently
considered to be on opposite ends of the wound healing spec-
trum. This concept underpins attempts to promote regenerative
healing by suppression of scarring mechanisms8,63. Our study
suggests that scarring/fibrosis in skin wounds may not affect HF
morphogenesis if the appropriate regenerative ques are applied.
Although long-term activation of Wnt signaling, a hallmark of
fibrotic repair, was observed in small wounds, the physiological
level of Wnt signaling in scarring wounds did not negatively
impact HFN in the presence of Shh activation. These studies
provide evidence that fibrotic repair can be genetically subverted
and offers possible tools to bypass extensive reprograming of
adult skin cells into an “embryonic status” or for “stem cell
transplantation” strategies to lead to regenerative healing in
mammals.
HFN is largely a recapitulation of hair follicle development.
However, the requirements for Shh regulation may be different
in embryonic HF development and adult HFN. Shh-null mice
can develop DP16 and Smo is dispensable for the initial
establishment of DP in embryos17. Similarly, while epithelial
Wnts are sufficient for embryonic HF development, both epi-
thelial and dermal Wnts are needed for adult HFN54,64. The
absolute requirement for Shh/Smo signaling in adult de novo
DP formation may reflect a vulnerability in regeneration
mechanisms compared to organogenesis in the embryo, whose
development is often ensured by redundant compensatory
mechanisms.
In conclusion, our study is the first to show that de novo DP
can be created in adult skin by modulating a signaling pathway in
the dermis. Future studies will be directed toward understanding
the upstream mechanisms of Shh regulation, as well as down-
stream mechanisms leading to HF morphogenesis following de
novo establishment of DP.
Methods
Mice. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) at NYU School of Medicine. All mice with proper genotype
were used for the designed experiments regardless of sex. LSL-Shh mice in which
mouse Shh is expressed under the control of β-actin promoter upon Cre medicated
excision of stop sequence, were previously generated as described in Wang et al23.
Axin2-CreER59 and β-catenin fl(ex3)65 were obtained from indicated researchers.
Gli1-LacZ (008211), R26-SmoM2 (005130), K14-CreER (005107), Shh fl/fl (004293),
Pdgfra-CreER (018280), Smofl/fl (004526), SM22-rtTA (006875), tetO-Cre (006224),
Wls fl/fl (012888), Axin2-LacZ (009120) and R26-Tomato reporter mouse (007908),
were purchased from the Jackson laboratory.
To induce CreER activity, tamoxifen (TAM) treatment was performed by
intraperitoneal injection (0.1 mg per g body weight) of a 20 mg per ml solution in
corn oil66. To induce rtTA activity, mice were administered doxycycline-containing
chow (20 g per kg, Bio-Serv).
Wound experiment. Wound experiments were carried out with 3–4-week-old
or 7–8-week-old mice as described in Ito et al.11. All wounding experiments
were performed after anesthetization of mice with isoflurane. Briefly, for full-
thickness large wound, 1 cm2 (1 X 1 cm) or 2.25 cm2 (1.5 X 1.5 cm) of skin were
excised for 3–4-week or 7–8-week-old mice, respectively. For small wound,
skin was excised by 4 mm full-thickness biopsy punch (Acuderm Inc.) as
published67. For loss of function study of Hh pathway, wounds were harvested
at PW21d by which the number of neogenic HFs was saturated in control
wounds. For gain of function study of Hh pathway, samples were harvested
around 30 days after wounding (PW30d~) to allow continuous formation of
neogenic HFs.
Whole-mount HFN assay. Whole-mount HFN assay to detect K17+ hair folli-
cles and AP+ DP was performed as previously described11. To analyze hair
follicle (dermal papilla and follicular epithelium) regeneration after wounding,
wounded skin was harvested from the mice and incubated in 5 mM or 20 mM
EDTA in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min ~2 h or overnight. The epidermis was gently
separated from the dermis under a dissecting microscope (Axiovision Discovery
V12, Zeiss, Germany). Both epidermis and dermis were fixed in 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and rinsed with PBS. For the
epidermis, standard DAB immunohistochemistry (see below) was performed
with anti-K17 antibody (ab) (Abcam, 1:500). For the dermis, AP staining was
performed. Dermis was incubated in NTMT solution (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM
Tris-Cl (pH 9.5), 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20) for 10 min and then incubated

Histochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed as published66. For paraffin
sections, tissues were fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C overnight and rinsed with PBS. Fol-
lowing sequential dehydration in ethanol and xylene, tissues were infiltrated by
paraffin and embedded in fresh paraffin. The paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were
chilled on ice for 10–15 min and cut at 6 µm thickness. The 6 µm tissue slices were
flattened out on warm water and placed on microscope slides and dried out at 37 °C
overnight. The tissue sections were rehydrated through xylene and graded series of
ethanol (2 × 100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, and 50%) and rinsed with PBS. After antigen
retrieval in Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0), the tissue sections were incubated with blocking
solution (10% BCS in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at RT then appropriate
primary antibodies at RT for 2 h or 4 °C overnight. After PBS washing, the tissue
sections were incubated with secondary antibodies at RT for 1 h. If necessary, the
second and third primary antibodies were used on the same tissue sections with
corresponding secondary antibodies. Following PBS rinsing, the stained slides were
mounted with mounting medium and stored at 4 °C for analysis. For frozen section,
tissues were fixed in 4% PFA on ice for 10 min and embedded in OCT compound on
dry ice. The frozen blocks were cut at 10 µm thickness, placed on microscope slides,
and dried out at RT. After PBS washing, the tissue sections were incubated in
blocking, primary, and secondary ab solutions as described above. All immunohis-
tochemical analysis was observed and photographed on an upright Nikon Eclipse Ti
or Zeiss Axiophot microscopes. Following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-K17
(1:500, Abcam), rabbit anti-Lef1 (1:100, Cell signaling), rabbit anti-Noggin (1:100,
Abcam), rabbit anti-RFP (1:500, Rockland), rabbit anti-Shh (1:50, Santa Cruz), rabbit
anti-SMA (1:100, Thermo Scientific), rabbit anti-F4/80 (1:100, Cell signaling), chicken
anti-K14 (1:500, BioLegend), mouse anti-β-catenin (1:500, Sigma), mouse anti-SM22α
(1:100, Abcam), mouse anti-AE13 (1:20, a gift of T.T. Sun), mouse anti-AE15 (1:20, a
gift of T.T. Sun), mouse anti-K15 (1:100, NeoMarkers), and rat anti-CD34 (1:50, BD
Bioscience). For histology, paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
in accordance with a general method. To detect collagen protein, trichrome staining
and picrosirius red staining were carried out using Masson’s Trichrome Stain Kit and
Picrosirius Red Stain Kit, respectively (Polysciences). Trichrome staining was per-
formed at NYUMC experimental pathology core.

 X-gal staining. X-gal staining was performed as published68. Skin wound tissues
were fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C for 30 min and rinsed with PBS. The tissues were
incubated in X-gal rinse buffer (2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Sodium deoxycholate, and
0.02% NP-40 in PBS) for 10 min at RT and then in X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-
indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) staining buffer (0.7 mg/ml X-gal, 0.5 M K4Fe(CN)6
and 0.5 M K3Fe(CN)6 in X-gal rinse buffer) at RT or 37 °C until color was
visualized. The tissues were photographed in whole mount using a dissection
microscope (Zeiss, Discovery V12). The tissues were then dehydrated in standard
graded series of ethanol, embedded in paraffin blocks and cut into 6-µm-thick
sections. To visualize nucleus, the tissues were counterstained with nuclear fast red
solution. Small wounds of Axin2-LacZ mice were incubated in 20 mM EDTA in
PBS at 37 °C for 1 h to separate dermis from epidermis before X-gal staining.
RNA-seq analysis. Skin wound tissues (PW11d) of control and K14-CreER; LSL-
Shh mice were incubated in 20 mM EDTA solution at 37 °C for 30 min. After
separation of epidermis from dermis, total RNA was isolated from epidermis and
dermis using RNeasy Plus Micro-Kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer.
Total RNA was provided to Genome Technology Center at NYU Langone Medical
Center for preparing RNA-seq libraries and sequencing. RNA-seq libraries were
prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA library prep, after ribo-
depletion with Ribozero Gold kit (Illumina) starting from 200 ng of DNAse I
treated total RNA, following the manufacturer’s protocol (15 cycles of PCR
amplification). The amplified libraries were purified using AMPure beads, quan-
tified by Qubit and QPCR, and visualized in an Agilent Bioanalyzer. The libraries
were pooled equimolarly, and sequenced on two lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2500
flow cell, v4 chemistry as paired-end 50. The differentially expressed genes (DEG)
were submitted to DAVID for GO term analysis69. Top related enriched terms
were selected and shown in the figures.
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Skin wounds were collected from of both SM22-
rtTA; tetO-Cre; R26-SmoM2/Tomato (SM22-SmoM2) and SM22-rtTA; tetO-Cre;
R26-Tomato (control) mice 3 days after complete re-epithelialization (dox treat-
ment from PW1d to PW12d) and incubated in 20 mM EDTA solution at 37 °C for
30 min to separate dermis from epidermis. The separated dermis was incubated in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Corning) containing 10% FBS
(Corning) and 0.35% type I collagenase (Worthington) at 37 °C for 1 h. After
rinsing with PBS, Tomato+ cells from isolated dermal cells were sorted with a
FACSAria II cell sorter (BD biosciences). scRNA-seq libraries were prepared using
the following: Single-Cell 3ʹ Reagent Kits v2: Chromium™ Single-Cell 3ʹ Library &
Gel Bead Kit v2 PN-120237, Single-Cell 3ʹ Chip Kit v2 PN-120236, i7 Multiplex Kit
PN-120262” (10x Genomics) 46 and the Single-Cell 3ʹ Reagent Kits v2 User Guide
(Manual Part # CG00052 Rev A). Libraries were run on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 as
2 × 150 paired-end reads, one full lane per sample, for approximately > 90%
sequencing saturation. Sequencing results were demultiplexed and converted to
FASTQ format using Illumina bcl2fastq software. The Cell Ranger Single-Cell
Software Suite (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene- expression/
software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) was used to perform sample demul-
tiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3′ gene counting. The cDNA insert
was aligned to the mm10/GRCm38 reference genome. Only confidently mapped,
non-PCR duplicates with valid barcodes and UMIs were used to generate the gene-
barcode matrix. Further analysis and visualization was performed using Seurat, an
R package containing implementations of commonly used single-cell analytical
techniques, including the identification of highly variable genes, dimensionality
reduction, standard unsupervised clustering algorithms, and the discovery of dif-
ferentially expressed genes and markers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/
26000488).
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Total RNA was isolated
using RNeasy Micro-Kit (Qiagen) as described by manufacturer and reverse-
transcribed with Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) for
cDNA synthesis. cDNA was amplified using taqman probes and the ABI 7900HT
SDS system. Transcripts were quantified relative to the housekeeping gene,
GAPDH. The probes used for this study were listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Hydroxyproline assay. To measure collagen content, hydroxyproline assay kit
(Sigma) was used according to manufacturer’s protocol. Whole wound tissues were
collected and homogenized in 100 µl of water per 10 mg tissue. After adding 100 µl
of HCl (~12 M) per 10 mg tissue into the homogenized tissue, the mixture was
hydrolyzed at 120 °C for 3 h. A total of 1–2 µl of supernatant was incubated in 100
µl of Chloramine T/Oxidation buffer mixture for 5 min and then, in 100 µl of
diluted DMAB reagent for 90 min, sequentially. The absorbance was measured at
560 nm using SpectraMax M3 (Molecular Devices).
Transmission electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
was carried out in Microscopy Laboratory at NYU Langone Medical Center70. The
harvested wounds were dissected (0.5 X1 cm) and put the wounds on top of paper
tower. The skin wounds were fixed in the fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde,
and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) with 1%
tannic acid for 30 min and further dissected to 1 × 3 mm smaller pieces. Fixation
process was continued in the same fixative at RT for 2 h, then 4 °C overnight. The
skin then post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h at RT, block staining in 1%
uranyl acetate overnight at 4 °C, then dehydration in a standard manner and
embedded in EMbed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for trans-
mission electron microscopy. Semi-thin sections were cut at 1 mm and stained with
1% Toluidine Blue to evaluate the orientation of the sample. Ultrathin sections (60
nm) were cut, mounted on copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate. Stained grids were examined under Philips cm-12 electron microscope (FEI;
Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and photographed with a Gatan (4k X2.7 k) digital
camera (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA).
Statistical analysis and image processing. The whole-mount HFN assay was
performed with at least three wound samples per genotype, and the data were
representative of over three independent experiments. Data were represented as
mean ± s.d. To calculate p-values, Student’s t-test was used on Microsoft Excel, with
two-tailed tests and unequal variance. All graphs were generated by Microsoft Excel
and GraphPad Prism. Images were processed using Image J and Adobe Photoshop.
For transforming AP signals into colored dots using Photoshop, images of AP
staining of wound were first turned into black and white, reduced background, and
changed into red, green or cyan colors. Three images were then merged by over-
lapping the center of each wound.
