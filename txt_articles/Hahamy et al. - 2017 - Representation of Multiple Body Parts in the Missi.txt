In Brief
Hahamy et al. characterize how daily
compensatory behavior associates with
changed brain organization in individuals
born with one hand. They find that body
parts used to substitute hand function
show increased representation in the
brain territory of the missing hand. These
findings offer novel perspectives on brain
development and plasticity.

SUMMARY
Individuals born without one hand (congenital one-
handers) provide a unique model for understanding
the relationship between focal reorganization in
the sensorimotor cortex and everyday behavior. We
previously reported that the missing hand’s territory
of one-handers becomes utilized by its cortical
neighbor (residual arm representation), depending
on residual arm usage in daily life to substitute for
the missing hand’s function [1, 2]. However, the
repertoire of compensatory behaviors may involve
utilization of other body parts that do not cortically
neighbor the hand territory. Accordingly, the pattern
of brain reorganization may be more extensive [3].
Here we studied unconstrained compensatory stra-
tegies under ecological conditions in one-handers,
as well as changes in activation, connectivity, and
neurochemical profile in their missing hand’s cortical
territory. We found that compensatory behaviors in
one-handers involved multiple body parts (residual
arm, lips, and feet). This diversified compensatory
profile was associated with large-scale cortical
reorganization, regardless of cortical proximity to
the hand territory. Representations of those body
parts used to substitute hand function all mapped
onto the cortical territory of the missing hand, as
evidenced by task-based and resting-state fMRI.
The missing-hand territory also exhibited reduced
GABA levels, suggesting a reduction in connec-
tional selectivity to enable the expression of diverse
cortical inputs. Because the same body parts used
for compensatory purposes are those showing
increased representation in the missing hand’s terri-
tory, we suggest that the typical hand territory may
not necessarily represent the hand per se, but rather
any other body part that shares the functionality of
the missing hand [4].
RESULTS
Compensatory Behavior in One-Handers Involves
Multiple Body Parts
We first characterized compensatory behavioral strategies in
congenital one-handers while they performed tasks simulating
everyday situations (Figure 1). One-handers mostly relied on
their intact hand and residual arm to perform everyday tasks.
As expected, they relied on their residual arm less in comparison
to controls’ entire nondominant upper limb (hand and arm) (p <
0.001). When compared to controls, one-handers were also
more likely to use their lower face (p = 0.02), lower limbs (p <
0.001), and objects in their environment (p < 0.001) to substitute
their missing hand’s function, but not their intact hand (see Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures).
Increased Activation during Movements of Multiple
Body Parts in the Missing-Hand Territory
We next examined activation during movements of those
body parts employed for compensatory usage. One-handers’
arm
was
compared
to
the
controls’
nondominant
arm.
Whole-brain group contrast maps for movements of the
nondominant/residual
arm,
lips,
and
feet
each
showed
increased activation centered in the missing-hand territory of
one-handers, compared to controls (Figure 2, left panel;
Table S1; Figure S1 depicts one-handers and controls’
group maps). This activation expanded beyond the hand
area but did not engage the relevant body-part territories,
as confirmed in an region of interest (ROI) analysis of the lip
and foot areas (Table S2A; see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures).
An independent ROI analysis confirmed increased activation
in the (putative) missing-hand territory of one-handers during
movements of the residual arm (t(35) = 4.93; p < 0.001), lips
(t(36) = 3.9; p < 0.001), and feet (t(36) = 2.12; p = 0.04), relative

 to controls (Figure 2, right panel). When comparing activation
in the hand territories across hemispheres and groups, the
residual arm (F(1,35) = 17.65, p < 0.001) and lips (F(1,36) =
11.18, p = 0.002), but not the feet (F(1,36) = 1.48, p = 0.23),
showed a significant interaction, indicating that increased
activation in one-handers is specific to the missing-hand re-
gion (Table S2B details activation in the intact-hand region).
Movements of the intact hand, which was not overused
by one-handers (Figure 1B [2]), did not produce increased
activation in one-handers’ missing-hand territory compared
to controls (t(36) = 1.47; p = 0.15; Figure 2). A repeated-mea-
sures ANOVA with factors group (one-handers, controls),
hemisphere (missing, intact), and body part (arm, lips, feet,
intact hand) confirmed that reorganization in the missing-
hand territory was selective to those body parts used for
compensatory purposes (three-way interaction F(2,34) = 5.24,
p = 0.01).
Increased Resting-State Coupling between the Missing-
Hand Territory and the Lip and Foot Territories
Habitual behaviors have been suggested to be imprinted into
resting-state functional connections [1, 5–9]. We therefore exam-
ined whether reorganization in one-handers would also be
evident in the functional coupling between the sensorimotor
missing/nondominant hand and the lips (contralateral to the
missing/nondominant hand), bilateral foot, and intact/dominant

 hand ROIs using resting-state partial correlations. Compared to
controls, one-handers showed increased coupling between the
missing-hand ROI and both the lip (t(38) = 2.61; p = 0.01) and
foot (t(38) = 2.22; p = 0.03) ROIs (Figure 3; Figures S2A–S2C depict
whole-brain functional connectivity results). We also found signif-
icant decoupling between one-handers’ bilateral sensorimotor
hand territories compared to controls (t(38) = �3.6; p < 0.001),
as previously reported [1]. Repeated-measures ANOVA with fac-
tors group (one-hander, controls) and connectivity with the
missing-hand territory for ROIs (lips, feet, intact hand) revealed
a significant interaction (F(2,37) = 8.28, p = 0.001), confirming
dissociated connectivity between body-part territories that are
used or unused for compensatory purposes and the missing-
hand territory.
To test whether the increased connectivity with the missing-
hand territory was limited to the sensorimotor cortex, we studied
the global signal, defined as the averaged resting-state time
course across all gray-matter voxels [10]. One-handers’ missing-
hand territory showed greater correlation with the global signal
relative to controls (t(38) = 2.86; p = 0.007; Figure 4A), even after
regressing out the temporal component representing the
sensorimotor network from the global signal (t(38) = 5.73;
p < 0.001; see Figure S2D and Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures). Increased global signal connectivity was specific
to the missing-hand territory, as indicated by a significant group
by hemisphere interaction (F(1,38) = 12.85, p = 0.001 and F(1,38) =
8.42, p = 0.006, before and after regression of the sensorimotor
component from the global signal, respectively). This analysis
suggests a weak, albeit widespread, increased coupling be-
tween one-handers’ missing-hand territory and the rest of the
brain.
Decreased GABA Concentration in One-Handers’
Missing-Hand Territory
The increased connectivity observed in one-handers’ missing-
hand territory may be triggered by reduced inhibitory connec-
tions in this region due to a congenital input loss. Decreased
connectional selectivity could unmask normally silenced inputs,
allowing for increased representation of cortically displaced in-
puts from other body parts in the missing-hand territory. Indeed,
magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis revealed lower ab-
solute GABA levels in one-handers’ missing-hand territory
compared to controls’ nondominant-hand territory (t(36) = 3;
p = 0.005; Figure 4B) and a significant group by hemisphere
interaction (F(1,36) = 4.83, p = 0.03), supporting our prediction.
Brain and Behavior Correlations
No significant correlations were found between reorganization
measurements and performance on behavioral tasks (see Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures).
DISCUSSION
Early studies in congenital one-handers found no lip remapping
into the missing-hand territory using passive tactile stimuli
[11, 12]. Later studies, using sensorimotor tasks as described
here, reported feet remapping into the hand territory in individ-
uals with congenital or early bilateral hand absence, with
exceptional abilities to manipulate objects with their feet
[13, 14]. Here, we show that multiplex compensatory strategies
of typically behaving one-handers is associated with large-
scale brain remapping of body representation. Reorganization
in the missing-hand territory was observed simultaneously for
arm, foot, and lip representations, regardless of cortical dis-
tance from the hand territory [15]. Our findings indicate that
representations in the missing-hand territory can be flexibly
distributed to body parts that share the same functional
utility as the absent hand, as will be discussed below. The

 discrepancy with earlier studies, which used passive tasks and
small sample sizes, likely originates from increased activation
during active tasks due to expression of multiple inputs into
the sensory cortex.
The missing-hand territory showed increased coupling with
the global signal, which may provide insight into the process
by which this region becomes activated by displaced inputs
from the residual arm, lips, and feet. During brain development,
the putative hand territory is deprived of peripheral inputs that
normally shape its function. Instead, this region may become
weakly activated by other, nonspecific inputs [16], as reflected
in increased coupling with the global signal. This interpretation
is supported by observed GABA reduction in the missing-hand
territory, hinting at the unmasking of normally silenced inputs.
Consolidation of displaced representations in the missing-hand
territory likely depends on Hebbian-like co-activations with de-
scending inputs involved in the canonical function of a hand
(e.g., coordination with the other hand). According to the con-
nectivity bias theory [4], the inherent function of a region, and
therefore opportunities for its reorganization, will be rooted in
its connectivity patterns (as well as sensitivity to task-distinctive
features [17]). As compensatory strategies unfold during early
childhood, inputs evoked by substituting the missing hand’s
function (by the residual arm, lips, and feet) may consolidate
more efficiently than non-behaviorally related inputs in the
missing-hand territory. Furthermore, other body parts unused
for compensatory purposes (the intact hand; see [1, 2, 18]) will
not benefit from the missing hand’s resources, regardless of
connectional biases (see Supplemental Experimental Proced-
ures for further details). Our findings suggest that the typical
hand territory may not necessarily represent the hand per se,
but rather any other body part that can mimic the missing hand’s
functionality. Together with related findings from visual cortex
reorganization in congenitally blind individuals [19], our results
suggest that reorganization may be functionally, rather than to-
pologically, restricted. This is in contrast to prominent theories
that limit reorganization in the primary somatosensory cortex
to cortical neighbors [20–22].
Lip remapping into the missing-hand territory (as observed
using both passive [23] and active [e.g., 24–26] lip-stimulation
paradigms) is considered a major driver of phantom limb pain
in amputees [23, 27]. Because congenital one-handers show
lip remapping but do not experience phantom pain, our results
provide
a
counter-example
to
the
maladaptive
plasticity
theory of phantom pain. This and other recent evidence
showing typical somatotopy in amputees [15, 28, 29] suggest
that the maladaptive plasticity theory should be reconsidered,
as well as therapeutic approaches derived from it (e.g., mirror
therapy [30]).
Finally, although the same body parts used for compensatory
behavior also showed increased activation in the missing-hand
territory, no correlations were found between behavior and reor-
ganization. This could be attributed to experimental constraints
in capturing variability in compensatory behavior or ecologically
valid brain activation. Alternatively, since behavior is likely to alter
throughout the course of life, brain reorganization may not reflect
compensatory strategies in adulthood, but rather during earlier
developmental stages. It is also possible that behavior and brain
reorganization are not directly related. For example, the unmask-
ing of otherwise-silenced connections may not necessarily be
harnessed to guide behavior [31]. Further research is needed
to characterize the relation between brain and behavior
throughout the course of life.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Full experimental procedures are available in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Participants
Seventeen individuals with congenital unilateral upper-limb deficit (Table S3)
and 24 matched two-handed controls were recruited for our study. One
one-hander and two controls did not complete the scanning session.
Recruitment was carried out with assistance from Opcare (prosthetics
providers for National Health Services, UK) in accordance with Oxford Univer-
sity’s Medical Sciences inter-divisional research ethics committee (Ref: MSD-
IDREC-C2-2014-003). Informed consent and consent to publish was obtained
in accordance with ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki (1964).
Behavioral Task
To characterize habitual compensatory behavior, participants completed
five tasks, designed to simulate everyday situations (e.g., wrapping a
present, handling money, handling cafeteria food). Task performance was
video recorded and analyzed offline (see Table S4 for task completion
times). Behavior was characterized based on usage of one (or more) of
the following body parts during the task: intact/dominant hand and intact/
dominant arm (in one-handers and controls, respectively); residual arm
and prosthesis (or nondominant hand and arm in controls); mouth and
chin; legs and torso; utilization of objects in the environment (see examples
in Movie S1.) Performance was assessed based on dependency and fre-
quency of use of each body part for task completion. Two independent
raters analyzed the videos offline. An inter-rater reliability assessment using
the nonparametric ‘‘limits of agreement’’ [32] established reliability for three
of five tasks. Upper-limb scores across one-handers were further validated
against questionnaire scores for residual arm usage in daily tasks [2]
(Spearman’s rho = �0.81, p < 0.001), confirming the validity of the behav-
ioral results. Behavioral scores were compared between groups using per-
mutation tests.
Assessment of Brain Reorganization
Each participant underwent one scanning session, involving structural mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI), MR spectroscopy, resting-state functional
MRI (fMRI), visual task-based fMRI (not reported here), and motor task-
based fMRI (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for acquisition
details). Data collected for individuals missing a right hand (n = 4) and for
left-handed controls (task: n = 7; rest: n = 8) were horizontally flipped prior
to all functional analyses. The proportion of flipped data did not differ be-
tween groups (task: c2
(1) = 0.21, p = 0.65; rest: c2
(1) = 0.32, p = 0.57; see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figure S3 for validation of
this procedure).
fMRI Scans
In the motor task, participants were visually instructed to move their hands
(finger flexion/extension), arms (elbow flexion/extension), lips, or feet (bilateral
toe movements), as previously detailed [2].
All fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using FSL’s FEAT (ver-
sions 5.0 and 6.0, respectively). Task-based statistical parametric maps
were computed for each condition versus resting baseline. Activation
maps were thresholded using clusters determined by Z > 2.3 and were fam-
ily-wise-error corrected using a cluster significance threshold of p < 0.05
with FLAME.
An ROI for the sensorimotor hand territory was defined by averaging the low-
level contrasts of intact/dominant hand movements versus rest across the two
groups (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The putative missing-
hand ROI was defined by mirror-flipping the intact/dominant-hand ROI on
the x axis [1, 2] (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for validation of
this ROI). ROIs of the arm and lip (in the deprived/nondominant hemisphere)
Current Biology 27, 1350–1355, May 8, 2017
1353
 and foot (bilaterally) were defined using a similar procedure. Condition-specific
activations within the two hand ROIs were compared between groups using a
repeated-measures ANOVA.
In the fMRI resting-state task, participants were instructed to focus on a fix-
ation-cross and let their minds wander. For each participant, the time course of
the missing/nondominant-hand ROI was correlated with the time course of
each of the lip, foot, and intact-hand ROIs, while partialing out the time courses
of the remaining ROIs using MATLAB. Resulting coefficients were compared
between groups using repeated-measures ANOVA. In addition, the correla-
tions of the global signal [10] with the hand ROIs for each participant were sub-
mitted to a repeated-measures ANOVA.
MR Spectroscopy
Data were acquired and preprocessed as described in [33]. Absolute neuro-
chemical concentrations of GABA were extracted from the spectra of each
sensorimotor hand region while correcting for voxel tissue content and were
compared between groups using repeated-measures ANOVA.
