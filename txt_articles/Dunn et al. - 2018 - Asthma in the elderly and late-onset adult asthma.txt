Abstract
Elderly asthmatics are at a higher risk for morbidity and mortality from their asthma
than younger patients. There are important age-related physiologic and immunologic
changes that complicate the presentation, diagnosis, and management of asthma in
the aged population. Evidence suggests that elderly asthmatics are more likely to be
underdiagnosed and undertreated. Additionally, elderly patients with asthma have
highest rates of morbidity and mortality from their disease than younger patients.
The underlying airway inflammation of asthma in this age group likely differs from
younger patients and is felt to be non-type 2 mediated. While elderly patients are
underrepresented in clinical trials, subgroup analysis of large clinical trials suggests
they may be less likely to respond to traditional asthma therapies (ie, corticos-
teroids). As the armamentarium of pharmacologic asthma therapies expands, it will
be critical to include elderly asthmatics in large clinical trials so that therapy may be
better tailored to this at-risk and growing population.

INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF
THE PROBLEM
Elderly patients with asthma have higher rates of morbidity and mor-
tality directly attributable to their disease when compared to
younger patients.1-3 There are multiple etiologies for these poorer
outcomes, including underdiagnosis and undertreatment of asthma in
the aged, and factors associated with geriatric medicine such as
decreased cognition, improper medication use, presence of other
comorbid conditions, and polypharmacy. There may also be a
decreased response to currently available asthma therapies in the
aged. Long-standing asthma (LSA), defined as asthma that developed
in childhood, is likely to be different than late-onset asthma (LOA) in
regard to its etiology, underlying inflammation (see Table 1), and as a
consequence, its treatment. The impact of asthma in the aged is
compounded by the “normal” changes of the airway structure and
alterations of the immunologic response with aging. Not surprisingly,
asthma in patients >65 years of age has a significant negative impact
on measures of quality of life (QOL).4 Despite these statistics, the
pathophysiology and treatment of asthma in older patients are not
as well characterized as it is in younger adults and children. This
article reviews the current knowledge of asthma in the aged, specifi-
cally addressing its underlying etiologies, phenotypes, and treatment,
and highlights important areas for future research for this at-risk and
growing population.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ASTHMA IN OLDER
ADULTS
As the life expectancy increases across the world, the number of
people over the age of 65 years is expected to nearly triple by 2050
to reach approximately 1.5 billion or 16% of the global population
by this time.5 While the current prevalence of asthma is reported
between 4% and 13% of adults over age 65 years,6-10 this number is
likely an underestimate as it is frequently underdiagnosed in this age
group.11,12,13 With an aging population, the numbers of older
patients with asthma will also increase. Importantly, this age group
of patients has the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from
their disease compared with other ages.2,3 Elderly patients with
asthma are >5 times more likely to die from their disease than
younger individuals. While mortality rates in some age groups have

 decreased, this is not true of the elderly.3,14,15 Of aged patients,
those who are female, Black, Hispanic, and from a lower-income
group are at the greatest risk for frequent hospitalizations.2 The rea-
sons for these trends are multifactorial and include underdiagnosis
of asthma,16 the presence of other comorbid conditions, underper-
ception of asthma symptoms,17-19 potential cognitive decline with
aging, and adverse effects from polypharmacy. Inhaled corticos-
teroids (ICSs), the cornerstone of chronic asthma management, are
also underutilized in elderly patients.9,20,21 Although ICS use reduces
hospital admissions and mortality in this population,22 they may be
less effective in older patients with asthma, who are more likely to
have predominantly neutrophilic inflammation.23-26 Clearly, a better
understanding of the underlying pathophysiology in this population
warrants further study.

AGING AND LUNG STRUCTURE
There are several age-related changes in lung physiology and mor-
phology that occur and likely impact asthma. Aging is associated
with a marked decrease in elastic recoil, greater chest wall rigidity,
and reduced respiratory muscle strength. Estenne et al27 demon-
strated a 31% reduction in chest wall compliance with aging among
52 subjects aged 24-75 years. The reduced chest wall compliance is
a result of calcification of costochondral junctions, costal cartilage,
and degenerative joint disease of the spine as well as partial and
complete osteoporotic fractures increasing dorsal kyphosis.28 Maxi-
mum inspiratory and expiratory pressures are reduced secondary to
diaphragmatic weakness and correlate to age-related skeletal muscle
weakness.28,29 Respiratory muscle weakness is frequently magnified
in patients with comorbidities (neurologic, cardiac, renal disease),
frailty and poor nutrition, all more prevalent among the elderly.30,31
It has been long recognized that there are also important age-related
changes in the lung parenchyma. In a postmortem study, there was
significant age-related peripheral airway narrowing with reduced air-
way surface-to-volume ratio.32 The term “senile lung” has been
coined and Verbeken et al33 in 1992 reported alveolar dilation and
ductal ectasia without emphysematous destruction or fibrosis from
lungs of elderly patients without previously known lung disease.
Decreased elastic recoil, detected in the aging lung, is felt to be a
result of these morphologic changes. The sum result of the age-asso-
ciated changes, including reduced chest wall compliance, decreased
respiratory muscle strength, and the macro- and microscopic changes
in the lung parenchyma, is postulated to have a significant role in
altering pulmonary function. In particular, older patients, even with-
out lung disease, are more likely to have obstructive and mixed pat-
terns with increased residual volume (RV), and reductions in forced
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, and FVC with
a minimal change in total lung capacity.28 The decline in FEV1 gener-
ally begins to occur between 25 and 30 years of age and is initially
linear (approximately 28 mL/year in men and 25 mL/year in females)
but accelerates with increasing age.34 The age-related decline in
FEV1 is further accelerated in patients with asthma (when controlling
for smoke exposure) compared to those without lung disease.35
Therefore, it is critical to use age-adjusted values when interpreting
spirometry results in older patients to avoid overdiagnosis of respira-
tory impairment.36

CELLULAR BIOLOGY OF THE AGING
LUNG
The physiologic and histopathologic findings in the airways of aging
subjects are driven by important cellular age-associated changes.
Acknowledging the importance of aging and lung disease, the Ameri-
can Thoracic Society (ATS) highlighted this topic at the 2014 annual
meeting.37 The summary statement recommended to address several
of the following “tentative hallmarks” of mammalian aging: genomic
instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of pro-
teostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction,
cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular
communication38 when studying lung disease in older patients. At
present, most work investigating these cellular hallmarks of aging in
the lung has focused on COPD and pulmonary fibrosis. However, a
reduced telomere length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PMNs) correlated with increased asthma severity in a small group of
patients (aged 25-60 years)39 and in another study, was more likely
detected in patients with childhood-onset persistent vs adolescent-
onset asthma.40 Additionally, in a murine model of asthma, inhibiting
thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) decreased cellular senscence.41
Additional future work is needed to more fully address the impact of
cellular senescence with asthma.
The immune system is complex and is divided into the innate and
the adaptive responses. The innate arm provides an initial defense
against pathogens through noncellular (eg, C-reactive protein, man-
nose-binding protein, and complement) and cellular (eg, phagocytic
cells [neutrophils, macrophages/monocytes], epithelial cells, and natu-
ral killer cells) components. The innate response is not long-lived, but
activates the antigen-specific adaptive response which includes
humoral immune defenses (mediated through B cells) and cellular
responses (mediated by T cells). With increasing age, there are alter-
ations in both the innate and adaptive immune responses, termed

 “immunosenescence.”
These
age-associated
changes
include
a
“blunted” response after a pathogenic exposure or tissue injury, par-
tially mediated through an irreversible loss of cellular replication and
impaired tissue repair. However, despite an inability to proliferate,
senescent cells remain alive, and function at a diminished or altered
capacity. This results in an increased low-grade basal systemic inflam-
mation (characterized by increased IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a) in the
absence of an overt infection, referred to as “inflamm-aging”.42
Research in immunosenescence has focused primarily upon can-
cer and autoimmunity, but not asthma. However, immunosenescence
likely has important consequences in elderly asthmatics. Immunose-
nescence increases susceptibility to airway infections in the elderly,
which in turn may exacerbate underlying asthma, or potentially play
a role in the inception of late-onset asthma (LOA).43 Neutrophils and
macrophages function in the initial clearance of pathogens through
phagocytosis, recruitment and maturation of dendritic cells, transport
of antigens to lymph nodes, and secretion of neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs), which immobilize bacteria. With increasing age, neu-
trophil chemotaxis to the site of inflammation is reduced44 and
fewer NETs are produced.45 Aged macrophages and neutrophils
have reduced phagocytic capabilities.46-51 There is increased basal
production of superoxide anions, increasing reactive oxygen species
(ROS), which damages local tissues.52-54 Despite increased basal pro-
duction of ROS, its induction in response to a bacterial infection is
suppressed in older compared with younger patients.52,55,56
The number of neutrophils in the airway of aging individuals
without airway disease increases.57,58 This impact on asthma is not
clear. Emerging data suggest that older patients with asthma have
increased sputum neutrophils compared with younger patients,23-25
even when controlling for aging,26 with increased levels of neutrophil
mediators including MMP-9, neutrophil elastase, and interleukin (IL)-
8, resembling changes seen in a phenotype of severe asthma noted
in some younger adults. Determining underlying airway inflammation
in older adults with asthma is important as neutrophilic asthma is
often less responsive to corticosteroid treatment,59 suggesting that
alternative therapies may be indicated for older patients.
There is a limited understanding of the age-associated changes in
eosinophil number and function in older patients with asthma. Eosi-
nophils, stimulated primarily by IL-5, play a central role in the airway
inflammation and chronic airway remodeling in younger patients
with asthma.60 Aged eosinophils may have decreased effector func-
tions compared with younger patients. Peripheral eosinophils from
patients with asthma (55-80 years of age) had decreased degranula-
tion in response to IL-5 stimulation and a trend for decreased super-
oxide production, but no significant difference in leukotriene C4
(LTC4) production, when compared to cells from patients 20-
40 years of age.24,61 The eosinophil’s role in bronchial hyper-respon-
siveness (BHR) in older asthma patients is also not clear. In a mouse
model of asthma, antigen-sensitized and airway-challenged aged
mice had greater bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) eosinophilia compared
with younger mice. BHR was lower in the former, suggesting that
increased airway eosinophilia did not correlated to airway hyper-
responsiveness.62 However, the development of BHR later in life
was associated with elevated peripheral blood eosinophil counts in
males (mean age 60 years) enrolled in the Normative Aging Study.63
Thus, eosinophils may be less functional in the elderly and their role
in BHR is not presently well established.
The ability to mount an adaptive immune response declines with
increasing age. There is a reduced ability of B cells to produce speci-
fic and long-lasting antibodies to antigens (eg, vaccination, infection)
and a lack of a rapid immunologic response when encountering
pathogens.64 Aging decreases T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and
diversity, which results in a loss of T-cell proliferation and decreased
viral clearance.65-67 With age, the thymus gland, the producer of
mature T cells, begins to involute, and by 75 years of age is almost
completely replaced with fatty tissue.68 Although the number of
na€
ıve T cells decreases with aging, the total number of circulating T
cells remain relatively constant due to an increased resistance to
apoptosis of memory T cells.69 Additionally, there is an age-related
decline in CD8+ T cells and an increase in CD4/CD8 ratio.70 Cyto-
kine secretion by the adaptive immune system is altered with aging,
although study results are varied. Some suggest increased IFN-c
(Th1-like)
secretion
by
activated
peripheral
CD4+
and
CD8+
cells,71,72 whereas others show a shift toward type 2 cytokine (Th2)
production.73,74 Airway inflammation in atopic asthma (more com-
mon in younger patients) is considered to be mediated by Th2 cells
(which secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13) vs Th1 cells which are typically
more responsive to corticosteroid treatment.
Some patients with asthma exhibit a Th1 and Th17-mediated
pattern of inflammation, frequently associated with neutrophilic
inflammation and increased disease severity.75,76 Th17 cells are a
subgroup of T cells that secrete IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, and are
differentiated from na€
ıve T cells when stimulated by IL-6 (which has
increased expression that is associated with aging) and TGF-b. Th17
cell frequency appears to increase with aging.77 Recent data in aged
mouse models of asthma also demonstrate an increased expression
of airway Th17 expression.78 It will be important to ascertain
whether Th17 increases further with aging and asthma. Increased IL-
17 in older patients with asthma likely contributes to increased air-
way neutrophilia and may be an additional target for therapy of
asthma in this group of patients with difficult-to-treat disease.
In the general population, including individuals with and without
atopy, total IgE declines with increasing age, typically peaking around
age 20 years.79-81 However, some studies have not reported this
trend.82-84 Allergen-specific IgE also decreases with aging. Studies
including healthy subjects with and without asthma and other atopic
diseases suggest that approximately 40%-50% of subjects under the
age of 50 years and approximately 35% of subjects older than 50
are IgE sensitized to at least one allergen.81,83-85 However, whether
IgE antigen sensitization and subsequent exposure alter asthma
severity is not well established in the aged patient with asthma.
In summary, the changes in the aging immune system are complex
and not fully understood in aging asthmatics and require further study.
While there is evidence of increased neutrophilic inflammation and
Th17-mediated pathology in elderly patients with asthma, the eosinophil
and Th2-mediated inflammation likely play an important role as well.

AIRWAY REMODELING AND AGING
Airway remodeling, structural changes in the airways and lung par-
enchyma, can occur in asthma and is felt in part to be secondary to
persistent inflammation. The features of airway remodeling include
subepithelial fibrosis, goblet, and submucosal gland hyperplasia,
increased airway smooth muscle mass, and increased airway vascu-
larity and occur in both the large and small airways and in patients
with all disease severities.86 The duration of asthma likely impacts
airway remodeling; therefore, it is hypothesized that older patients
with LSA have increased features of airway remodeling; however,
this has not been definitively established.
Subepithelial fibrosis is marked by increased deposition and
decreased degradation of the extracellular matrix. There is an
increase in extracellular collagens I, III, and V. Progenitor cells and
myofibroblasts are felt to be the primary effector cell involved in this
process. Increased TGF-b and decreased activity of matrix metallo-
proteinases have also been implicated.87 Airway smooth muscle cell
mass has long been recognized to be increased in severe asthmatics
due to cellular hyperplasia and hypertrophy. This increase in cell divi-
sion (hyperplasia) is mediated by mitogens which lead to activation
of tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors and in turn,
intracellular stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. These
pathways are upregulated by
normal mitogens
and potentially
inflammatory cytokines seen in the airways of asthmatics.88 Alterna-
tively, there is also some evidence that peripheral recruitment of cir-
culating progenitor myofibroblasts may also be a mechanism of
increased airway smooth muscle cell mass seen in asthmatics.89
It is implied that airway remodeling is likely more important in
long-standing elderly asthmatics who have these changes superim-
posed upon normal aging lung rather than LOA, or in younger patients
with asthma; however, this requires further study. In 6-month vs 6-
week-old antigen-sensitized and airway-challenged mice, there was
increased staining for mucus, peribronchial collagen, and smooth mus-
cle staining in the aged group.90 Histologic evaluation of younger (ages
17-23 years of age) compared with older (ages 40-49 years of age)
patients with fatal asthma demonstrated increased wall area in the lat-
ter group91 due to increased smooth muscle. Despite increased subep-
ithelial collagen deposition in both younger and older patients with
asthma compared with age-matched controls, there was no significant
difference between the two groups of asthmatics. A more recent study
evaluated airway CT imaging and reported that aged (mean age
73 years) vs younger (mean age 49 years) patients with asthma had
greater large and small airways thickening; however, age-matched
controls were not included in the study.92

PHENOTYPES OF ASTHMA IN THE
AGED
There are likely distinct phenotypes of asthma in older patients;
however, unlike in younger patients, they are not well characterized.
Older patients with asthma are loosely classified based upon their
age of asthma onset and duration of disease into (i) long-standing
asthma (LSA), (ii) late-onset asthma (LOA), or (iii) remitting childhood
asthma that recurs at a later age. The age cutoff for the diagnosis of
LOA is not consistent: >12 years of age in some studies and up to
>65 years in others.93 As many as 40% of patients >60 years of age
with current asthma report their first symptom onset after the age
of 40 years.10,94 LSA typically develops before the age of 12 years.
Atopy appears to have a minimal role on the development of LOA
compared with LSA. Factors predicting LOA include smoking, new
habitual snoring, new rhinitis symptoms, chronic sinus symptoms,
weight gain, and obesity (especially among females).95-98 Observa-
tional studies report that nearly 50% of subjects with asthma onset
after the age of 60 years had a respiratory tract infection just prior
to the onset of their symptoms.43 Although viral infections are com-
mon triggers for asthma inception, Chlamydia pneumonaie and other
atypical infections may be the etiology in some patients with LOA.99
Exposure to dust particles, art supplies, and cleaning products have
been reported to induce LOA in some patients.100,101
Whether asthma is early or late onset and its duration likely have
prognostic implications. Patients with LOA tend to have a higher
baseline FEV1, and a more pronounced bronchodilator response than
those with LSA, who are more likely to have irreversible or partially
reversible
airway
obstruction,
and
greater
airway
hyperinfla-
tion.102,103 For patients enrolled in the Severe Asthma Research Pro-
gram (SARP), both aging and duration of disease were important risk
factors for severity, although the absolute age had a greater effect
than disease duration.104 Park et al105 evaluated 872 patients with
asthma >65 years of age using cluster analysis and reported that
those with the longest duration of disease had higher risks for acute
exacerbations and accelerated lung function decline than those with
a more recent asthma onset and a more normal lung function.

DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA IN OLDER
ADULTS
Similar to younger patients, the diagnosis of asthma in the aged
requires the presence of compatible symptoms (eg, chest tightness,
intermittent and nocturnal wheezing, and dyspnea). In some patients,
cough may be the only symptom.106 Older, compared to younger
patients with asthma, may be poor perceivers of dyspnea even in
the presence of significant airflow obstruction.107,108 Dyspnea is also
a common symptom of other chronic disorders (heart failure, anemia,
etc.); therefore, asthma as an etiology may be overlooked. Addition-
ally, some older patients may limit their activity to avoid becoming
dyspneic, or attribute it to aging itself, therefore, making following
asthma control or diagnosis of LOA more difficult. Therefore, in
order to avoid misdiagnosis, it is important to rule out other com-
mon chronic respiratory problems such as COPD and as well as
more rare causes of chronic airflow obstruction including bronchiec-
tasis and constrictive bronchiolitis in aged patients.
The same objective measures used to diagnose asthma in
younger patients are performed in older patients; however, there are
DUNN ET AL
|
287
 important considerations. First, as previously mentioned, the FEV1/
FVC ratio decreases with aging; therefore, using age-adjusted values
is essential to avoid overdiagnosis of obstruction.36,109 The FEV1/
FEV6 may be a more easily obtained surrogate for FEV1/FVC in such
individuals.110,111 Second, with aging itself, BHR to methacholine has
been reported to increase;112-114 therefore, provocation testing may
be less accurate in this age group. Third, spirometry and standard
bronchoprovocation tests involve effort dependent maneuvers. Over
80% of older persons can achieve ATS acceptable results; however,
it may be difficult for those who are frail.115-121 While exhaled nitric
oxide (NO) has been extensively studied in adults and children with
asthma, there are a limited number of publications investigating this
biomarker and its diagnostic utility in elderly asthmatics. One study
by Columbo et al122 looked at thirty elderly asthmatics with stable
asthma and did not find a significant correlation with asthma control
measures and spirometric values. Furthermore, moderate asthma
exacerbations did not cause a significant elevation in NO levels in
this population. However, more recently Netto et al123 analyzed
exhaled NO in 43 patients, 34 of which had asthma, and found a
correlation between exhaled NO levels, asthma symptoms, and pre-
vious diagnosis of asthma. More work will have to be done to define
the role of exhaled NO in the diagnosis and management of the
elderly asthmatic. Computed tomography imaging, if performed, is
more likely to show evidence of large and small airway disease.92
Finally, bronchoprovocation challenges may be contraindicated in
some elderly patients due to low baseline lung function or cardiac
comorbidities.

MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA IN THE
ELDERLY
The management of asthma in elderly patients is directed at control-
ling symptoms and eliminating or reducing exacerbating triggers.
Specifically relating to older patients, there are important exacerbat-
ing factors including comorbid diseases, appropriate medication
usage, drug-drug interactions and drug side-effects, and physiologic
differences, that all must be considered to achieve these goals (see
Table 2).

ENVIRONMENTAL AND
PHARMACOLOGIC EXPOSURES
While atopy in older patients with asthma is not as prevalent as it is
in younger patients, it is not uncommon. Studies from the United
States, the Netherlands, and France report specific antigen IgE sensi-
tization rates in older adults with asthma between 23.9% and
74%.124-127 The most common aeroallergens to which older patients
are sensitized are not consistent among studies, but typically include
cats,124 dust mites,125,128 and cockroaches.129 Whether atopy wors-
ens asthma outcomes in aged patients is not known. Some studies
including older subjects with asthma suggest that an atopic history
may increase disease severity.114,129,130 Data from NHANES 2005-
2006 suggested that the relationship between antigen sensitization
and asthma outcomes (eg, hospitalizations, healthcare use) was not
different in patients aged 20-40 years vs those aged ≥55 years.131
Nonetheless, evaluation of IgE sensitization to antigens and exposure
to environmental triggers still remains an important part of manage-
ment of asthma in older adults. Immunotherapy (IT) is an option for
elderly asthmatics with known allergic triggers; however, its ability
to modify the host response to antigen at a later age is not estab-
lished. Additionally, caution must be observed in patients undergoing
allergen IT who are prescribed a b-blocker therapy. b-blockers may
attenuate the response to emergency epinephrine, if needed, for an
adverse reaction to allergen IT.
Eliminating smoke exposure, both first hand and second hand, is
important in the management of elderly asthmatics as current smok-
ing exacerbates asthma and may attenuate the response to inhaled
corticosteroids.132
A careful medical history, obtaining all currently prescribed medi-
cations, is necessary in the management of the older patient with
asthma. Several medications may exacerbate asthma. Nonselective
beta-blockers, administered either systemically or topically, can pro-
mote bronchospasm in some patients with asthma;133,134 however,
recent data suggest that cardioselective beta-blockers may be safe in
patients with well-controlled asthma, especially if indicated for car-
diovascular reasons.135 Aspirin hypersensitivity is a cause of acute
asthma exacerbations in some patients, and should be considered in
those with sinusitis and nasal polyps. In those patients, aspirin
desensitization may improve asthma control.136

ics; therefore, pharmacologic management is guided by currently

 available ones137,138 However, these recommendations are based
upon studies carried out in patients aged <60 years. As asthma in
younger adults is likely different from that in older patients, future
guidelines should include studies enrolling aged patients. Addition-
ally,
there
are

important
challenges
which
should
be
addressed in the pharmacologic management of the older patients
with asthma. Older patients may have a poor inhaler technique, due
to
decreased cognitive function139
or
physical
impairment.
To
improve medication delivery, patients may be prescribed breath-acti-
vated medication devices,140 spacers to attach to metered dose
inhalers (MDI), or medications which can be delivered by nebulizer
(including corticosteroids for daily controller use, although this is not
currently an FDA indication for older patients with asthma).
10.1

Rescue medications
Although all patients with asthma require a rescue medication, there
are several potential considerations that must be addressed. Beta2-
receptor density, responsiveness, and affinity may decline with age;
however, this has not been consistently established.141,142 This out-
come could reduce the response to this group of acute bronchodila-
tors among elderly patients. Older patients may be more sensitive to
adverse effects of beta2-agonists, particularly those with unstable
cardiovascular disorders.143,144 Animal models suggest that parasym-
pathetic activity decreases with aging, but relatively little is known
about the effect of aging on anticholinergic responses in humans.
Short-acting anticholinergic medications may be useful bronchodila-
tors in the elderly and do not have the cardiac side-effects of beta2-
agonists. Although more likely with oral anticholinergics, cognitive
impairment, falls, symptomatic urinary outlet obstruction, and closed-
angle glaucoma are potential risks with inhaled preparations; there-
fore, careful monitoring of older patients prescribed these medica-
tions should occur.145
10.2

Controller therapies
ICSs are an important backbone of controller therapy in patients
with persistent asthma. ICSs are most efficacious in patients with
eosinophilic, Th2-mediated asthma. Th-17-mediated asthma, marked
by neutrophilic inflammation, has been recognized to be less respon-
sive to ICS therapy and is likely more common among older asthmat-
ics.26 A large, retrospective review of 10 landmark asthma trials in
patients with mild-moderate disease on ICS therapy found an age-
related increase in treatment failures.146 In this analysis, the number
of patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids was significantly higher
than all other therapies, suggesting that it may have been underpow-
ered to detect a similarly increased risk with other controller medica-
tions. Despite these data, ICS therapy is still currently the preferred
medication for older patients with persistent disease. Furthermore,
as older asthmatics have been reported to have more small airway
involvement,92 using ultrafine particle ICS medications may be bene-
ficial. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been studied in this
age group. Older patients receiving higher-dose ICS should be
monitored closely for decreased bone mineral density, increased
fracture risk, and cataracts.147,148 The safety of long-acting beta-ago-
nist (LABA) use in older patients, particularly those with underlying
cardiovascular disease, has been most studied in COPD. Studies
specifically focused on the safety of this class of drugs in the elderly
asthmatic are lacking; however, the boxed warning for use of LABAs
as monotherapy applies to all patients with asthma. Long-acting
muscarinic antagonists have been shown to be efficacious as add-on
therapy in asthmatics up to 75 years of age.149 While not incorpo-
rated into the EPR-3 guidelines, long-acting anticholinergics such as
tiotropium have more recently been shown to be as effective as
long-acting beta-agonists in multiple large, randomized controlled tri-
als.149,150 These agents will likely play more of a role in the manage-
ment of poorly controlled asthmatics, but their use, in elderly
asthmatics, deserves further study.
Future prospective trials should evaluate whether or not increas-
ing inhaled corticosteroids (potentially with a small particle inhaled
steroid) or adding another controller therapy is the preferred man-
agement strategy in older adults.
Compliance with leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) may
be better in older patients with asthma, due to its ease of use. There
are a few studies examining their efficacy in older patients. Although
significant improvement in asthma indices was observed in older
patients receiving LTRAs, it was less pronounced than in younger
patients151 and in older patients treated with ICS therapy.152 More
recently, montelukast among elderly patients with severe asthma
was shown to be moderately efficacious in improving asthma control
days and reducing rescue medication use.153 Some older patients
with asthma have demonstrated clinical improvement after treatment
with anti-IgE (omalizumab) therapy, although the response may be
less than in younger patients.154,155,156,157
The most recent advances in asthma therapy have led to the
development of targeted biologic therapy directed at interleukins
known to drive specific subtypes of asthma. Anti-IL-5 therapy with
mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab has been shown, in
phase III trials to be efficacious in reducing asthma attacks and
improving lung function in poorly controlled asthmatics. Anti-IL-4R-
alpha (dupilumab), anti-IL-13 (tralokinumab), and other targeted ther-
apies hold promise as potential future targeted therapies in asthma.
These therapies have been well recognized to be efficacious, in care-
fully selected subsets of asthmatics with eosinophilic airway inflam-
mation. Subgroup analysis from recent trial data has suggested that
mepolizumab is effective in elderly asthmatics with eosinophilic
inflammation.158 Given their cost, their use will likely be reserved for
the severe asthmatics patients who are not controlled on conven-
tional therapy. In clinical practice, many elderly asthmatics will likely
fall into this category; however, the proportion of elderly patients
with eosinophilic airway inflammation will likely be less than younger
age groups. The use of these agents in elderly asthmatics will need
to be reserved for carefully selected patients.
In summary, there is a paucity of prospective data to determine
the best management approaches for this important group of asth-
matics. Given the recognition of the heterogeneity of asthma, there

 are initial basic, translational, and retrospective data that suggest
elderly asthmatics may have different airway inflammation. Addi-
tional prospective studies with new biologic medications for asthma
are needed in the aged population.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH
Given the recent recognition of the heterogeneity of asthma and the
growing appreciation of the morbidity and mortality among elderly
asthmatics, there is a great need for further basic, translation, and
clinical research targeting older patients. The recognition of the mul-
tiple mechanisms of biologic aging relevant to the asthmatic lung,
including, but not limited to, telomere length, mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion, autophagy, DNA methylation, immunosenescence, and airway
remodeling, is an area for research into mechanisms and potential
new therapeutics in asthma. Given the newer targeted therapies on
the horizon, it will also be important to determine their role in the
management of elderly patients with long-standing asthma and those
with late-onset asthma.

CONCLUSION
The underlying pathophysiology and optimal management of asthma
among older patients has long been overlooked. This is despite older
patients with asthma having the highest morbidity and mortality
rates from their disease, as shown in Figure 1. Asthma pathophysiol-
ogy in older patients is complex in that it is imposed on physiologic
changes of the airway associated with aging and changes of inflam-
mation with aging. Consequently, asthma in older patients is less
likely to respond to traditional asthma therapies including inhaled
corticosteroids. As new asthma pharmacologic therapies are devel-
oped and treatment becomes more personalized to individual pheno-
types of asthma, it will be vital to include elderly asthmatics (with
late-onset and long-standing disease) into large clinical trials to fur-
ther tailor therapy Figure 1.
