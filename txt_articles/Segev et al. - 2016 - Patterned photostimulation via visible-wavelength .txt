Abstract. Optogenetic methods developed over the past decade enable unprecedented optical activation and
silencing of specific neuronal cell types. However, light scattering in neural tissue precludes illuminating areas
deep within the brain via free-space optics; this has impeded employing optogenetics universally. Here, we report
an approach surmounting this significant limitation. We realize implantable, ultranarrow, silicon-based photonic
probes enabling the delivery of complex illumination patterns deep within brain tissue. Our approach combines
methods from integrated nanophotonics and microelectromechanical systems, to yield photonic probes that are
robust, scalable, and readily producible en masse. Their minute cross sections minimize tissue displacement upon
probe implantation. We functionally validate one probe design in vivo with mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2.
Highly local optogenetic neural activation is demonstrated by recording the induced response—both by
extracellular electrical recordings in the hippocampus and by two-photon functional imaging in the cortex of
mice coexpressing GCaMP6. © The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. Distribution

Introduction
An overarching technological goal in the field of optogenetics is
the development of new methods for stimulating neural circuits
with very high spatiotemporal precision. Ongoing efforts seek
to address large functional ensembles of neurons, i.e., “brain
circuits,” through realization of tools providing fine enough
resolution to interrogate and control each constituent neuron indi-
vidually and independently. Significant advances in the develop-
ment of excitatory and inhibitory opsins have been made over the
past decade that now permit direct optical control of cellular
processes.1 To realize the full potential of these technologies,
complementary methods for delivering light with cellular preci-
sion in vivo are now essential.2,3 Existing, state-of-the-art ap-
proaches involve the use of spatially patterned light, projected
via free-space optics, to stimulate small and transparent organ-
isms4–6 or excite neurons within superficial layers of the
cortex.7,8 However, light scattering and absorption in neural tis-
sue, characterized by the optical attenuation length, cause ballistic
light penetration to be extremely short.9 This makes it impossible
to employ free-space optical methods to probe brain regions
deeper than about ∼2 mm. This statement holds true even if
we take into account methods for two-photon and three-photon
excitation, and recent efforts made to develop opsins that operate
in the red or near infrared. With these limitations in mind, we
advance here an alternative approach, involving implantable pho-
tonic devices, as the most promising paradigm for delivering and
projecting high-resolution patterned light at “arbitrary depths”
and with minimal perturbation in the brain.
We identify five critical requirements for realizing widely
useful, implantable photonic devices, which we term “visible-
wavelength photonic probes”: (i) the probes should provide a
multiplicity of microscale illumination sources (hereafter “emit-
ter pixels,” or “E-pixels”), each individually controllable and
capable of delivering fine illumination, with cellular-scale
cross-section dimensions. Ideally, emission from these micro-
scale E-pixels should have minimal spatial overlap, while col-
lectively covering the entire brain volume of interest. (ii) This
patterned illumination must be delivered with sufficient inten-
sity to activate optogenetic effectors (actuators/silencers) within
the interrogated region. (iii) Associated thermal perturbations of
neural tissue at, or adjacent to, the implanted devices must
minimally affect neural circuits. Recent studies show that tem-
perature elevation of as small as 1°C can change the neural firing
rate and behavior of mice.10 (iv) The cross-sectional dimensions
of the probes must be made as small as possible—to reduce dis-
placement of brain tissue upon implantation, to minimize tissue
damage, and to suppress potential immunological response.11
(v) Finally, photonic nanoprobe fabrication should be compat-
ible with, and ultimately transferrable to, foundry (factory)-
based methods for mass production. This will permit wide

 deployment of this new technology in the near-term to the
neuroscience community. Here, we present a class of photonic
probes satisfying these requirements; they are based on inte-
grated, silicon-based nanophotonic components adapted to
operate at visible wavelengths and embedded onto implantable
silicon probes patterned by microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS) processes.

Implantable Photonic Neural Probes
Various architectures for implantable optical probes have
recently been proposed.12 For example, one approach relies
upon multiple optical fibers to excite individually addressed illu-
mination points, each driven by a dedicated laser source.13,14
Given the complexity of coupling many fibers to a probe,
this approach is capable of providing only a few illumination
points. To surmount this issue, coupling a fiber-bundle to on-
chip photonic waveguides has been proposed,15 but neither
in vitro nor in vivo validation of this particular approach has
been reported. Another approach implements modal multiplex-
ing to address several illumination points along an implantable
multimode optical fiber.16 However, this approach necessitates a
rather large distance between illumination points (>200 μm) to
avoid overlap between adjacent illumination beams. Neither
approach is readily upscalable to many emission points, nor
easily produced en masse.
An alternative approach involves the integration of micro-
scale light emitting diodes (μLEDs) directly onto the probe
shanks.17–19 A variation on this theme integrates laser diodes
upon the probe head,20–22 with their light output routed by
on-chip integrated photonic waveguides to emission points
located along the shanks. In both cases, however, the power dis-
sipated by these active μLED devices must be strictly limited,
given that neuronal activity thresholds are highly sensitive to
minute temperature variations.10,23 Minimizing the total heat
delivered to brain tissue by the probe, which is dominated by
the heat generated by the μLEDs in these architectures, can sig-
nificantly restrict the number of active illumination sources that
can be integrated. Unless the efficiency of μLED or laser diode
sources is dramatically increased, it will not be feasible to
include more than a limited number of active light emitters
on implantable photonic probes.
Here, we present a new paradigm for photonic probes that
employs wavelength division multiplexing (WDM).24 It pro-
vides the potential for massive upscaling of the number of
E-pixels that can be incorporated and individually addressed
within implantable, ultra-compact neural probes. The technique
of WDM employs a multiplicity of independent data streams,
each imprinted on individual carrier wavelengths (spectral chan-
nels), that are combined (i.e., multiplexed) and transmitted via
a single optical fiber. At the receiving end, these multispectral
signals are subsequently demultiplexed and delivered to their
intended destinations. In our application of WDM, each tempo-
rally modulated carrier wavelength is delivered to an indepen-
dent E-pixel at a specific, spatial location located along an
implantable photonic probe shank. Spectral separation is
achieved by photonic circuitry for WDM integrated within
the probe head. Our technique is exceptionally well suited
for optogenetic effectors, because currently employed opsins
respond to a relatively broad spectrum of light, typically span-
ning ∼50 nm.25,26 This permits accommodating many spectral
channels within the opsin absorption band. Additionally, this
unique assignment of different wavelengths to specifically
located E-pixels can be accomplished solely using “passive”
components, which neither requires power to operate, nor gen-
erate additional heat.
The photonic neural probes described herein provide a first
proof-of-concept of our paradigm. The prototype devices we
report here comprise implantable shanks, initially with nine
E-pixels, which are spectrally addressed through “one” sin-
gle-mode optical fiber. We implement the E-pixels themselves
using large diffractive grating couplers that produce beams with
low divergence angles, as small as 1.7 deg. This low-light diver-
gence offers beam cross-section dimensions that are comparable
to the size of neural cell bodies—even after traversing several
hundreds of micrometers. Other recent implementations of
implantable probes based on photonic technology27 do not pro-
vide a route toward the goal of generating complex illumination
patterns with narrow illumination beams at arbitrary locations
within the brain.

Probe Architecture and Fabrication
The overall structure of our prototype photonic probes is pat-
terned using standard nanophotonic and MEMS fabrication
processes (Appendix A, Fig. 6). The implantable, needle-like
probe shanks have widths of ∼90 μm near the probe head
decreasing to only ∼20 μm near the tip, with a uniform thick-
ness of 18 μm throughout. The shank tips are wedge-shaped
[Fig. 1(b)], with tips having a ∼1 μm radius of curvature;
this ensures smooth penetration of brain tissue with minimal
dimpling.28 Our approach yields implantable probes with overall
cross sections representing the state-of-the-art for optical probes.
They are far smaller than the optical fibers or endoscopes
currently implanted for optogenetic experiments (Appendix A,
Fig. 9). The shanks of the prototype probes reported here have
a pitch of 200 μm and lengths of either 3 or 5 mm, yet they
remain straight after fabrication through our careful engineering
of the ubiquitous internal stresses present within thin-film
multilayers (Appendix A).
The probe head [Fig. 1(a)] contains integrated nanophotonic
circuitry required to couple multispectral light delivered from
a single external optical fiber onto the probe chip and, sub-
sequently, to route the individual spectral components (chan-
nels) to specific emitters on the shank(s). E-pixels arrays
[Fig. 1(b)] can be placed at any location along the implantable
shanks; in the first prototypes reported here, we include nine
E-pixels, spaced on a 200-μm pitch. It is straightforward to
achieve ≤50 μm spacing between adjacent E-pixels without
changing our fabrication protocols29 (Appendix A).
4
Nanophotonic Circuitry
The visible-wavelength photonic circuitry on the probe is
fabricated from an optical multilayer comprising a 200-nm
thick silicon nitride (Si3N4) layer encapsulated between two
layers of silicon dioxide (SiO2), to yield a total thickness of
2.8 μm. This multilayer is grown upon a commercially available
silicon-on-insulator
(SOI)
substrate,
itself
comprising
a
15-μm-thick Si (structural) layer atop, a 2-μm buried oxide
(BOX) layer, above a 300-μm-thick Si wafer. The photonic
circuit is comprised of grating couplers, photonic waveguides,
and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs). In Appendix A, we
describe a microprism coupling method (hereafter, μ-prism)
bridging the external input fiber’s terminus to the on-chip gra-
ting coupler. This efficiently couples the light to the photonic
waveguides on-chip. Once on-chip, this multispectral light is

 routed by a single waveguide to an AWG located on the probe
head [Fig. 1(a)]. The AWGs function as passive optical demul-
tiplexers that spectrally separate the incoming wavelength-mul-
tiplexed signal to the nine output waveguides. These separated
post-AWG signals are subsequently routed by separate photonic
waveguides onto the shank, and then to their termini at individ-
ual E-pixels. These E-pixels (described in Appendix B) com-
prise small-footprint diffractive grating couplers patterned on
the surface of the shanks [Fig. 2(a) inset]; light routed to each
is emitted off-shank, almost perpendicularly, into adjacent neu-
ral tissue. Our prototype devices require a single optical fiber per
AWG or shank. Future designs will incorporate a hierarchical
on-probe photonic circuit, in which a master AWG drives sub-
sequent AWGs, to reduce the total number of required optical
fibers to one.
The critical integrated photonic elements on the probes—the
AWGs and the grating couplers—require spatiotemporally
coherent light for their operation. We drive them with multispec-
tral light generated and modulated off-probe, and then delivered
to the probe head by a single external optical fiber. The ratio of
the incident power delivered by the fiber, to the total power
emitted by the E-pixels, defines the probe insertion loss (IL).
The total IL of these first unoptimized prototypes is about
∼20 dB. Roughly, ∼16 dB of this arises from coupling loss
into and out of the probe, dominated by nonideal coupling
between the fiber and the on-chip photonic circuitry. The various
losses present are fully delineated in Appendix B, Fig. 11. In
future device generations, these ILs can be reduced significantly
through advanced engineering design and, especially, by use of
the highly optimized fabrication processes available at commer-
cial photonic foundries.30 We emphasize that the majority of
these losses, 18 dB in our current prototypes occurs within the
probe base, rather than at the point of emission, as is the case
for μLEDs.
Validation of the capability of our photonic probes to stimu-
late neural activity, as described in the next section, has been
achieved with E-pixel emission power that ranged between
5 to 10 μW. With IL of 20 dB, incident laser power of 1 mW
per E-pixel is required. Such power is readily available over
the relevant wavelength range with supercontinuum lasers.

Characterization of Single E-Pixel
Illumination
Our measurement and simulations results demonstrate that
E-pixels emit beams with a propagation direction angle of
2 to 30 deg from the normal to the probe surface [Fig. 2(a)].
The exact angle of each individual E-pixel can be engineered
during the probe design phase by setting the period of the gra-
ting couplers. Once probes are fabricated, this angle is fixed.
The low divergence of the beams minimizes overlap between
adjacent beams, while preserving light intensity over significant
propagation distances from the E-pixel. We have capitalized on
the highly collimated photonic probe beamshape to enable local
optogenetic activation of neurons.
The beam profile at the surface of the E-pixel is <6 μm
(FWHM) along both transverse axes of the beam [Fig. 2(a)
inset]. We characterize the beam profile versus distance from
probe shank by: (i) imaging in a fluorescein solution [Figs. 2(b)
and 13], (ii) imaging in, ∼300-μm thick, adult mouse brain
slices soaked overnight in a fluorescein solution [Fig. 2(c)],
and (iii) comparison with numerical simulations [Figs. 2(d),
14, and 15]. We find Fresnel diffraction determines the beam
intensity profile up to a distance of ∼70 μm from the probe;
beyond that, it is characterized by far-field Fraunhofer diffrac-
tion. (Appendix B; Fig. 15). The minimal beam width, observed
at the transition between the Fresnel and far-field regions at a
distance of ∼90 μm [Fig. 2(d)], is ∼10 μm in the fluorescein
solution, ∼17 μm at a distance of ∼70 μm in the brain slice,
and <5 μm at distances smaller than 100 μm in our simulations.
Light scattering results in a slightly larger beam divergence in
tissue [Fig. 2(c)] than in the fluorescein solution [Fig. 2(b)].
However, all beam widths measured up to a distance of 200 μm
are less than, or of order, the size of an individual neuronal cell
body. This property of E-pixel illumination permits reducing
the E-pixel pitch to ≤50 μm, while still maintaining negligible
overlap between adjacent beams.

Multibeam Illumination
Our use of WDM makes it possible to independently address on-
shank E-pixels by separate temporally modulated multispectral
components of the light delivered to the probe. Figure 3(a)
shows an illustration of our WDM approach. Coherent light
from a broadband (multispectral) source is split into N discrete
Fig. 1 Prototype photonic probe architecture. (a) Optical micrograph
showing photonic probes operating at visible wavelengths. This
specific design contains three 3-mm-long, 18-μm-thick shanks that
taper in width from 90 μm, at the head, down to 20 μm, near the tip.
The photonic elements comprise three AWG demultiplexers; one
per shank. Each is driven by a single-input waveguide (left) and
subsequently drives a multiplicity of output waveguides (right) that
traverse the shanks, carrying light to their ultimate destinations on
the shank tips. At their termini, the photonic waveguides drive grating
couplers (termed E-pixels), which couple light off-shank into brain tis-
sue. All the on-chip photonic elements are patterned from a 200-nm
thick silicon nitride layer, which is deposited on top of the oxidized
silicon structural layer used to form the probe body. (b) Photograph

stitute the E-pixels near the tip of a shank. The tapered waveguides
transform the small optical cross section of the submicron waveguides
to the larger neuronal-scale spot size delivered by the E-pixels.

18 μm, the thicker ∼320 μm probe head (on left) facilitates handling
and mounting of the device.

 spectral bins; each is employed as an independently controllable
transmission channel. Temporal modulation providing the
unique, arbitrarily complex illumination pattern required for
simultaneous excitation of specific locations within the brain
is imposed on each of these spectral channels. Figure 16 depicts
a possible approach for temporal modulation, using of the shelf
components.
Our embodiment of the on-chip optical demultiplexer is real-
ized with a visible wavelength AWG [Fig. 3(a), inset; Fig. 12].
AWGs are now perfected and commercially available for
use with infrared light in telecommunications technology,31
however, given their need for much tighter dimensional toler-
ances and smoother structures (to suppress diffuse sidewall
scattering),32–34 there are only a couple of reports of AWGs
configured for the visible spectrum to date. The blue-wave-
length AWGs we have developed for this work have a compact
footprint of <150 μm × 150 μm; accordingly, they are ideally
suited for integration within the heads of our miniature pho-
tonic probes [Fig. 1(b)]. By appropriately synthesizing the
multispectral light input [Figs. 3(b) and 3(c)], either individual
E-pixels or a multiplicity of them can be independently and
simultaneously addressed [Figs. 3(e) and 3(f)]. Figure 16 presents
a schematic of one possible setup for addressing E-pixels, which
provides high temporal bandwidth using a tunable acousto-
optic filter.
The maximum number of E-pixels addressable by a single
AWG is determined by the ratio of the absorption bandwidth
of the optogenetic effector to the bandwidth of the individual
spectral channels. For example, a typical optogenetic effector
such as ChR225 has an absorption bandwidth of ∼50 nm
centered near a wavelength of 460 nm, whereas the spectral
channel width, an engineerable parameter, can be much nar-
rower (Appendix C). In the designs here, we set the latter to
∼1 nm [Fig. 3(b)], thus permitting each AWGs to address up
to ∼50 E-pixels35 with only a single external fiber input to
the chip. Upscaling this number to even more E-pixels outputs
per fiber input is readily achievable with precise foundry-based
fabrication methods, which can permit definition of spectral
channels with a roughly 10× narrower bandwidth. However,
one must keep in mind that upscaling spectral channel density
must be accompanied by a proportional increase in applied
laser power per unit bandwidth, as the light will be distributed
over a larger number of E-pixels within the effector’s absorp-
tion band.

light (473 nm) is emitted from an E-pixel located ∼250 μm away from the tip of the shank. This light

Functional Validation
We validate the functional capabilities of our prototype photonic
probes in vivo, in two separate experimental implementations. In
the first, we optogenetically activate neurons in the hippocam-
pus of Thy1:18-ChR2-EYFP transgenic mice,36 while simulta-
neously recording induced extracellular electrical activity close
to the point of light stimulation. To achieve this, an electrically
insulated tungsten wire was glued directly atop the photonic
probe [Figs. 4(a) and 4(c)]. The uninsulated distal electrode
tip is positioned 100 μm above the E-pixel. This composite
probe was then advanced into the CA3 region of the hippocam-
pus of an anesthetized, head-fixed mouse [Fig. 4(c)]. In this
brain region, pyramidal neurons express high levels of ChR2-
EYFP.36 Shortly after implantation, the illumination beam was
directed rostrally and electrical measurements were recorded in
response to optical stimulation pulses. Several temporal patterns
of illumination were tested. The corresponding extracellular
electrical recording [Figs. 4(d) and 4(e)] reveals repeated and
intense multiunit spiking activity in direct response to light
pulses delivered by the photonic probe. No significant degrada-
tion in the rate or amplitude is observed for these multiunit bursts,
or even for pulses as long as 10 s. In these experiments, we esti-
mate the optical power emitted by the E-pixel to be <5 μW.
In a second experimental implementation, the functionality
of the photonic probes was assessed via simultaneous free-
space, two-photon functional imaging of cortical neurons in
a mouse coexpressing both ChR2 and GCaMP6s (Fig. 5).
The photonic probe was inserted at an angle of ∼35 deg into
cortical layer 2∕3. Although minor dimpling was observed
during photonic probe insertion at this angle, the probe was
sufficiently sharp to penetrate the dura with only moderate
pressure. Probe illumination was directed upward from the
surface of the probe into the brain tissue and a local population
of neurons was imaged ∼130 μm above the probe tip [dashed
white circles in Figs. 5(c) and 5(g)]. The approximate FWHM
beam width at the imaging plane was ∼20 μm.
For this second set of experiments, 200-ms light pulses with
an estimated optical output power of ∼10 μW were delivered
Fig. 3 Multibeam illumination. (a) Schematic elucidating the concept of WDM applied to photonic neural
probes. The inset in the demultiplexer block shows an electron micrograph of one of our blue-wavelength
AWGs (the scale bar represents 100 μm; Fig. 12). (b) Transmission measurements of the various output
channels of the AWG versus input light wavelength. Measurements are obtained by delivering a broad-
band light input to the AWG and measuring the output spectrum emitted from each output channel with a
spectrometer. (c) Schematic showing the optical setup used to address individual channels of the AWG.
We employ a Ti:Sapphire pulsed laser (946 nm) to pump a BBO crystal, which generates blue (473 nm)
light by exploiting a second harmonic generation process. Unconverted infrared light is redirected into
a beam blocker by a dichroic mirror; the converted blue light is coupled to the optical fiber. The 13-nm
bandwidth of the infrared pump signal reduces, after conversion, to blue light with a bandwidth of
∼5.5 nm. This is subsequently narrowed spectrally with a manually tuned bandpass filter (Alluxa,
FWHM 1 nm). Rotation of the filter tunes the central wavelength of this filter, thereby enabling dynamic
tuning of the passband. A shutter or an acousto-optic modulator can be added at any point along the
beam to temporally modulate the light. (d) Optical micrograph showing a shank with nine simultaneously
driven E-pixels. The center-to-center pitch between E-pixels is 200 μm in these prototypes. The anno-
tations denote the mapping between the spectral channels plotted in panel (b) and the spatial location of
the corresponding E-pixels to which they are coupled. The scale bar here represents 500 μm. (e) and
(f) Measured fluorescein PL patterns generated by simultaneous illumination from several E-pixels. The
spectrum (bandwidth and central wavelength) was set to 5.5 nm at 470 nm, and 1.8 nm at 473 nm, in
panels (e) and (f), respectively. The inset in panel (f) superimposes this spectrum with the spectral
response of the AWG. Here, scale bars represent 500 μm.

 by the photonic probe with a repetition rate of 0.2 Hz. The fluo-
rescence response of the ChR2/GCaMP6s-expressing cells was
simultaneously recorded by two-photon imaging. To prevent
saturation of the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) during the opti-
cal stimulation pulses from the photonic probe, a mechanical
shutter (Uniblitz TS6B) was used as a blanker during E-pixel
illumination pulses. To rule out the potentially confounding
effect of the audible “click” generated by this shutter (and
heard by the mouse), stimulation pulses were interleaved with
control events, in which only the shutter was activated without
concomitant light emission [Fig. 5(b)].
In this second proof-of-concept experiment, an individual
neuron was reliably activated by light pulses delivered from
an implanted photonic probe. Figure 5(d) shows the absence of
any response for control events. Analysis of the optical beam
trajectory in this experiment indicates that the light emitted
by the probe did not impinge upon the cell body of neuron
#1 directly, but instead activated a basal dendrite projecting
into the center of the beam illumination profile [Fig. 5(g)].
Given the highly collimated nature of light emitted from the
probe, simultaneous activation of neighboring neurons—labeled
#2, #3, and #4—was not induced. To confirm that these untrig-
gered neurons were indeed activatable, wide-field pulses of
blue light illumination were subsequently delivered through
the microscope objective. This resulted in widespread, simulta-
neous activation of the neurons within the illumination field
[Fig. 5(f)].

Discussion
To exploit the full potential of optogenetics, it is essential to
deliver light with high temporal and spatial resolution at arbi-
trary locations within the brain. Here, we demonstrate photonic
probes operating at visible wavelengths that permit realization
of this goal. Our photonic probes leverage technological devel-
opments achieved over the past two decades in the field of
optical communications at infrared wavelengths, realizing them
within the visible range of relevance for present-day optogenetic
reporters and effectors operating at visible wavelengths.
Specifically, we employ wavelength division demultiplexing
using AWG’s, integrated photonic waveguides, and E-pixels
realized as diffractive grating couplers. The technology of vis-
ible photonics is rapidly advancing, and this makes it feasible to
create a spectrum of components for assembling future complex
photonic neural probe architectures. Exceptionally promising
candidate technologies will enable fast switching37 and lensless
beam focusing.38 An important attribute of our photonic probe
paradigm is their mass producibility via existing photonics
foundry protocols. With our achievement of the proof-of-
concept reported here, significantly upscaling of E-pixel density
and multiplexing is now underway, enabled both with robust

 Appendix A: Probe Fabrication
A.1
Fabrication Process
Prototype probes were fabricated in Caltech’s Kavli Nanoscience
Institute cleanroom facilities. We have developed a fabrication
process for silicon nitride (Si3N4)-based photonic circuits (Fig. 6)
that is fully compatible with standard MEMS fabrication tech-
niques. The probes are fabricated on 100-mm SOI wafers, having
a top silicon layer thickness of 15 μm (Ultrasil Corporation). This
top layer constitutes the structural layer for the shanks and is the
dominant contribution to the total shank thickness (18 μm).
The optical layers are deposited on top of the silicon structural
layer, and comprise a thermally grown 1.5 μm silicon dioxide
(SiO2) layer and a 200-nm stoichiometric Si3N4 layer deposited
by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition [LPCVD, Fig. 6(a);
Rogue Valley Microdevices].
The photonic circuitry is patterned in Ma-N 2403 negative
electron-beam resist (MicroChem Corp.), using an electron-
beam pattern generator (Leica Microsystems EBPG-5000+).
The pattern is then transferred to the Si3N4 layer using an
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) pseudo-Bosch etch process
[Fig. 6(b)]. After stripping the residual e-beam resist, we clad
the photonic circuits by depositing a final ∼1 μm SiO2 layer
using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)
to complete the optical trilayer [Fig. 6(c)].
Following fabrication of the photonic circuits, we pattern and
release the individual probes from the 100-mm wafer. First, we
use a liftoff photolithography process, based on AZ 5214E pho-
toresist (Microchemicals, Inc.), to pattern a hard mask into the
shape of the probes. The mask is composed of a thin layer of
300-nm-thick aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Next, a sequence of ICP
etch processes is used to etch the probe shape into the front
side of the SOI wafer, stopping at the BOX layer [Fig. 6(d)].
Subsequently, a similar process is repeated to etch away the
backside of the wafer, leaving only the thin BOX layer framing
the probes [Fig. 6(e)]. This layer is then etched away by a quick
hydrofluoric acid (HF) dip, which leaves the individual probes
anchored to the wafer at four breakable points, and ready for
assembly and packaging. Approximately 300 individual probes
can be fabricated on a single 100-mm wafer using this fabrica-
tion process.
A.2
Probe Stress Balancing
The design of the probes can be configured to accommodate a
wide variety of experiments, with an arbitrary number of shanks,
as required. It is critical that the shanks be ideally straight to
circumvent buckling during the implantation process or their
outright mechanical failure,28 as well as to permit stacked
assembly of multiple shanks to realize implantable 3-D emitter
architectures. This is achieved in our devices by careful balanc-
ing of the internal stresses within the probes, through optimiza-
tion of the SiO2 layer thicknesses within the shank. In practice,
variations in the fabrication processes within, and between,
wafers result in intrinsic stress along the shanks; this can
become problematic with increasing shank length. As a proof
of concept, we have fabricated shanks with high yield having
lengths of 3 and 5 mm; these show minimal stress-induced
deflection. We believe that much longer shanks can be achieved
using commercial foundry fabrication processes, which achieve
superior dielectric layer uniformity and film thickness control
for improved stress balancing. Alternatively, for certain applica-
tions, it may be possible to increase the shank thickness to
achieve the same end.39 Our prototypes feature very thin multi-
layered shanks, with a uniform ∼18-μm thickness along their
length [Fig. 1(c)]. This layer thickness is dominated by the sil-
icon structural layer, which provides the primary mechanical
strength of the shanks.
A.3
Probe Packaging
We have developed a dedicated probe assembly and packaging
process to attain a lightweight and compact packaged probe
footprint (Fig. 7). The optical fiber assembly process is based
on coupling to the on-chip integrated photonics elements
using a μ-prism, which enables horizontal attachment of the
optical fiber to the surface of the probe, rather than vertical
attachment. This coplanar orientation of the fiber dramatically

 reduces the thickness of the packaged probes and greatly
improves its mechanical durability.
We have also explored an alternative method for coupling an
external optical fiber, also oriented parallel to the chip surface, to
an on-chip grating coupler. The second approach utilizes optical
fibers that are cleaved at an angle and subsequently polished,
and then metalized at the angled ends to create mirrors.40,41
The advantage of using a μ-prism is the flexibility in adjusting
the coupling angle between the optical fiber and the grating
coupler during the assembly process. The potential optical IL
obtained with the approach involving angle-polished fibers can
be much lower than the performance attained with μ-prisms, in
principle (see section below on IL measurement for details).
In practice, however, we find that variations in the fabrication
processes obtained in our shared fabrication facility, combined
with additional losses due to nonidealities in the input-coupling
angle, overwhelm the performance increase obtained using
angled polished fibers. However, in the future, our next-gener-
ation probes will be fabricated in foundry-based fabrication
facilities that can facilitate closely maintained tolerances in cou-
pling angle. In this case, the approach utilizing angled-polished
fibers will likely become favorable.
The first step in the packaging process is attaching a bare
cleaved optical fiber to a μ-prism. The role of the μ-prism is
to transform the propagation direction of the light from the
longitudinal to the transverse direction, so it can couple into
the grating coupler at almost perpendicular incidence with
respect to the grating surface. The fiber is attached to the
μ-prism at an angle of 5 deg, which is the designed coupling
angle of the grating couplers. The cross section of the
μ-prism is only 180 × 180 μm2 [Fig. 7(a)]. The attachment pro-
tocol first involves the application a drop of UVepoxy (Norland
Optical Adhesive 85) to the tip of the fiber. This is achieved by
dipping the fiber into a drop of epoxy. Then the fiber is aligned
to the μ-prism within a standard optical fiber alignment setup
[Fig. 7(b)]. Finally, the epoxy is cured by illumination with
385 nm UV light from an LED source (Thorlabs). Following
attachment of the μ-prism to the fiber, the μ-prism is sub-
sequently aligned to the input grating couplers. In this step,
the μ-prism is dipped into a drop of UV epoxy, which permits
application of a small amount of epoxy to the bottom surface of
the μ-prism (Fig. 8). The μ-prism is then aligned using the same
setup, and the epoxy is cured with UV light [Fig. 7(c)]. The
packaging process is completed by tightly securing the optical
fiber to the probe by applying additional UVepoxy (d), followed
by medical grade epoxy (e). This provides stress relief for the
critical juncture regions between the fiber, μ-prism, and chip.
This packaging process (f) results in a compact probe with
a total thickness ranging from one to two millimeters.
A.4
Probe Dimensions
As stated in the main text, using MEMS fabrication techniques,
we are able to fabricate implantable shanks, with cross sections
of only 20 μm × 18 μm at the shank tip. This 18-μm thickness is
constant throughout the length of the shank, whereas the shank
width grows to 90 μm at the head of the probe. Figure 9 shows
a comparison between the dimensions of the shank and the
dimensions of a standard 125-μm diameter optical fiber.
As stated in the main text, the E-pixels on our initial proto-
type probes are spaced 200 μm apart. This spacing is being
reduced to 100 μm in our current design (Fig. 10) and will be

Appendix B: Optical Properties
B.1
Insertion Loss Measurement
The IL of the waveguides was measured using the cutback
method. The ILs of several waveguides of varying lengths
were measured and the IL per length was extracted by fitting
a curve to data for the IL versus waveguide length. We sampled
36 waveguides, divided into six groups, with increasing lengths
spanning from 1 to 11 mm, incremented by 2 mm between
groups. Each waveguide was measured by coupling 473-nm
blue laser light into the waveguide through an input grating
coupler, and subsequently collecting the light emitted by the
output grating coupler with a multimode optical fiber (Thorlabs
FG050LGA, 0.22 NA). This collected light was detected
with an optical power meter (Newport 1936-C). No index
matching gel was used. Figure 11 shows the cutback measure-
ment results.
The IL was calculated by fitting the measured results of
waveguide transmittance versus waveguide length to an expo-
nentially decaying curve (Fig. 11). We deduce that the IL of
these particular waveguides is 13 dB∕cm. This value is
10 dB higher than the IL of state-of-the-art foundry fabricated
waveguides.42 Two major reasons underlie the relatively high
losses measured for our waveguides. First, the waveguide side-
walls are rough due to the etching and beam size in the electron
beam patterning. Second, random defects are present in the iso-
lating SiO2 deposited on top of the waveguides using PECVD.
These sources of loss are greatly reduced in commercial pho-
tonic foundry processes.

grating coupler spectrum is the transmission between the fiber mode and the fundamental transverse-
electric (TE) mode of the waveguide with a coupling angle of 5 deg; the E-pixel spectrum is the percent-
age of optical power radiated toward brain tissue with a fundamental TE mode input to the waveguide.

 The measured total combined losses of our input and output
grating-couplers are, on average, 16 dB. These losses can be
understood by considering the details of the grating designs.
Both gratings are uniform with straight grating teeth, a designed
period of 299 nm, and a duty cycle of 60% (i.e., a 60% etched
region per period). A single etch step was employed to define
both the waveguides and grating features, but the close proxim-
ity and small size of features in the gratings result in the grating
teeth having a partial etch of 135-nm depth, whereas the larger
waveguides are fully etched [Fig. 11(c)]. This grating design
works well for the output grating coupler (E-pixel), which has
a simulated IL of 1.8 dB at a wavelength of 473 nm [Fig. 11(d),
blue curve]. However, straight grating teeth are not optimal for
the input grating coupler, where the input light propagates over
roughly 180 μm in the μ-prism and has a curved wavefront;43
simulations show that this yields an IL for the input grating
of 11.2 dB at 473 nm. Curving the teeth of the input grating
coupler could significantly improve the coupling efficiency.43
The discrepancy between the 16-dB measured and 13-dB simu-
lated IL of the input and output-grating couplers combined may
be due to factors such as reflections at the prism-to-fiber and
prism-to-chip interfaces, fabrication variations, and deviation
of the input polarization from the optimal, TE polarization
assumed in the simulations.
The efficiency of the input grating coupler can be improved
by optimizing the thickness of the isolating SiO2, and by reduc-
ing the propagation distance between the input fiber and the
grating. Using in-line fiber coupling with an angle-polished
fiber40,41 would shorten the propagation distance to roughly
63 μm and, according to our simulations, will reduce the
input IL at 473 nm to 5.8 dB [Fig. 11(d), red curve] and the
output IL to 1.7 dB, to a total of 7.5 dB. Further improvement
is possible by including a metal back-reflector below the gra-
tings,44 which will reduce the amount of light lost into the sub-
strate. Our simulations show this will further reduce the IL to
5.0 dB for the input grating coupler and to 0.7 dB for the
output grating coupler. In the future, use of optimized and stand-
ardized foundry fabrication30 will greatly reduce variations in
the design parameters—this is difficult to achieve in shared
university fabrication
facilities.
In
foundry-based probes,
waveguide propagation losses should be reduced to 2 to
3 dB∕cm (corresponding to <1 dB in total for our probes).42,45
Incorporating the above improvements, we project that total
optical losses should be <10 dB in our next, foundry-produced,
generation of devices.
The typical IL of our AWGs is measured to be 2 to 3 dB. Our
IL measurements are carried out using the setup in Fig. 12(c).
A supercontinuum laser (WhiteLase micro, Fianium) is used to
input broadband light to the AWG, and the transmitted power
spectrum through each channel of the AWG is subsequently
measured using a spectrometer. A reference measurement is
obtained by measuring the transmitted light through a reference
waveguide, which bypasses the AWG [Fig. 12(a)]. The excess
loss through the AWG is calculated by dividing the spectral
power of the former measurement by the latter one.
In these prototypes, the emitting surface area of the E-pixels is
10 μm × 10 μm; however, the total footprint of the E-pixel is
100 μm × 10 μm to permit incorporation of a tapered waveguide

B.2
Illumination Beam Analysis
Characterization of the optical beam profile in a fluorescein–
water solution was performed using the measurement apparatus
depicted in Fig. 13. The fluorescein solution was prepared by
dissolving fluorescein sodium salt (Fisher Scientific LLC) in
high (>9.5) pH deionized water to generate a 10-μM concen-
trated solution. The solution was injected into a thin reservoir
composed of two cover slips spaced 1-mm apart (Fig. 13).
The probe was inserted sidewise into this fluorescein–water sol-
ution and then imaged from above. The inset in Fig. 14 shows
an optical micrograph of the measured fluorescein photostimu-
lation response over a distance of 10 mm.
Figure 14 shows simulation results of the beam intensity pat-
tern over the distance spanning 1 mm from the probe surface.
According to these simulations, the beam FWHM width at 1 mm
is only 30 μm. These results emphasize the exceptional direction-
ality of the illumination pattern generated by the E-pixels.
Figure 15 shows the beam illumination pattern in the first
70 μm, a region where Fresnel difraction dominates the beam
profile. High-resolution simulation results of the beam profile
in this region qualitatively agree with the measured results.
The simulated and measured beam divergence angles in the
fluorescent solution are 1.7 and 3.5 deg, respectively. For com-
parison, this is equivalent to illumination from an optical fiber
with a numerical aperture of ∼0.04. Nevertheless, due to the
initial strong directionality of the beam, the beam within the
brain slice remains tightly confined to a diameter of ∼25 μm,
even at a distance of ∼200 μm from the probe surface (Fig. 2).

A schematic representation of the optical setup used to address
individual channels of the AWG is presented in Fig. 3 of the

source for many of the AWG characterization experiments we
conducted. The spectral density of these lasers can be above

 1 mW∕nm, which is sufficient to excite ChR2 expressing neu-
rons, even when taking into account the probe IL. However, in
our wavelength multiplexing demonstration in Fig. 3 of the
main text, we used infrared light emitted by an ultrafast (65 fs
pulse duration, 80-MHz repetition rate) Ti:Sapphire laser
(Tsunami, Spectra Physics) that was converted into blue light
using a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal through second har-
monic generation process. The converted light had a spectral
bandwidth of 5 to 6 nm, a central wavelength of 473 nm, and
an average power of 20 mW. A narrow band filter with a nomi-
nal FWHM bandwidth of 1 nm (473 OD7 LaserLine Filter,
ALLUXA) was used to address individual AWG channels. By
manually tuning the incident angle of the laser beam onto the filter,
we were able to tune the central passband frequency of the filter.
Figure 16 shows our proposed alternative channel multiplex-
ing design, which can simultaneously control multiple wave-
length channels with a short-response time. In this approach,
an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) is used to filter nar-
row-band wavelength channels from the broadband input light.
Commercially available AOTFs support up to 10 channels using
a single acousto-optic cell47,48 [Gooch & Housego (UK) Ltd.,
NKT Photonics]; individual channel bandwidths can be as nar-
row as 0.3 nm. Using several AOTF modules enables tens of
channels (E-pixels) to be addressed simultaneously.
C.2
AWG Design
Our AWG design is based on the detailed theoretical derivation
in Ref. 31. The AWGs include one input channel and nine out-
put channels [Fig. 12(d)]. The center channel is positioned at
473 nm and the channel spacing is 1 nm. The overall footprint
of the AWGs is 0.02 mm2, which is very well suited for inte-
gration into our compact neural probe designs.
As explained in the main text, the maximum number of E-pix-
els that can be addressed by a single AWG is determined by the
ratio of the spectral bandwidth of the activation curve of the tar-
geted opsin molecular actuator to the width of an individual AWG
spectral channel. However, experimental considerations can fur-
ther restrict the extent of the opsin activation bandwidth for opti-
mal activation purposes. For example, the targeted brain area
might express other opsins with overlapping activation spectra.
If crosstalk between two opsins is to be minimized, excitation
in the spectral regions in which they overlap should be avoided.
Although, in principle, minimization of the AWG channel
bandwidth maximizes the number of addressable E-pixels, in
practice, fabrication limitations, optical power, and crosstalk
can all reduce the minimum achievable AWG channel band-
width. Among factors that impose a limit to the achievable
reduction of channel bandwidth are fabrication imperfections.
Additionally, the spectral density of the power optical emitted
from the excitation laser is critical. The power emitted by an
individual E-pixel is the laser’s spectral power density integrated
over the spectral bandwidth of the channel minus system losses;
hence, narrower channels require sources with higher power.
Finally, crosstalk between AWG channels can increase with
decreasing channel bandwidths.

Baylor College of Medicine
All procedures were carried out in accordance with the ethical
guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Baylor College of Medicine. Imaging experiments
were performed on ∼6-month old VIP-Cre/ChR2-tdTomato
mice (C57Bl/6 background) that were injected 3 to 5 weeks
prior to the experiment with 1 μL of a 1∶1 mixture of
AAV1-CamKIIa-ChR2(E123T/T159C)-mCherry

Syn.GCamp6s.WPRE.SV40 (both viruses from University of
Pennsylvania vector core). Injections were performed stereotac-
tically, targeting visual and extra striate cortex ∼300 μm below
the surface. Injections were made through a burr hole at a steep
(∼60 deg) angle, in order to leave the bone above the trans-
fected region intact, preventing any inflammation of the dura
that would obscure the imaging window.
On the day of the experiment, anesthesia was induced with
3% isoflurane and mice were placed in a stereotactic head holder
(Kopf Instruments) on top of a homeothermic blanket that main-
tained their body temperature at 37°C throughout the experi-
ment. Anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% to 2% isoflurane
during the surgical procedure. Mice were injected with 5 to
10 mg∕kg ketoprofen subcutaneously at the start of the surgery.
After shaving the scalp, bupivicane (0.05 cc, 0.5%, Marcaine)
was applied subcutaneously, and after 10 to 20 min an ∼1 cm2
area of skin was removed above the skull. The wound margins
were sealed with surgical glue (VetBond, 3M), and a headbar
was attached with dental cement (Dentsply Grip Cement).
Throughout the rest of the surgery and experiment, the headbar
was used to stabilize the animal’s head. Using a surgical drill
and HP 1∕2 burr, an ∼3 mm craniotomy was opened above the
viral injection site and the exposed cortex was washed with
ACSF (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM Glucose, 10 mM
HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4).
The anesthetized mouse was positioned under the micro-
scope on a heating pad, and the probe was held in a motorized
micromanipulator (Luigs and Neumann). Using the micromani-
pulator, the probe tip was positioned by eye under the objective
at the surface of the cortex. The experiment was then performed
under two-photon imaging (920-nm wavelength at 25 to 40 mW,
Nikon 16× objective, 0.8 NA). Some unknown characteristic of
the probe made the tip visible as a red dot under two-photon
imaging, and the probe could also be located by its shadow
on the cortex below. The probe was advanced into the cortex
through the dura. Typically, some dimpling was observed and
the “rebound” of the surface of the cortex indicated that the
probe had penetrated through the dura.
Light pulses were delivered from the probe at regular (0.2 to
1 Hz) intervals. Using two-photon imaging of GCaMP6s fluo-
rescence, we searched for and located cells in imaging planes
above the probe that appeared by eye to be activated by the
light pulses, and recorded their activity for later analysis. The
stimulus protocol consisted of two sequentially interleaved con-
ditions. In the first condition, intermittent brief (50 to 400 ms)
blue light pulses were delivered through the probe to activate
ChR2-expressing cells. Activation in cells coexpressing ChR2

 and GCaMP6 was observed as reliable increases (and sub-
sequent characteristic decays) in GCaMP fluorescence follow-
ing stimulation. During these stimulation periods, a high-speed
mechanical shutter (Uniblitz TS1 shutter, ED12DSS controller)
protected the PMT in the two-photon microscope from both
scattered blue light and one-photon fluorescence from the prepa-
ration. Interleaved controls, time intervals where the shutter was
closed but no light was delivered, ensured that responses were
not being driven by the audible click that the shutter made as it
opened and closed.

Transgenic Thy1:18-ChR2-EYFP male mice were group housed
three to five to a cage and kept on a reverse 12-h light/dark cycle
with ad libitum food and water. Experimental protocols were
approved by Stanford University IACUC and meet guidelines
of the National Institutes of Health guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals.
Animals were anesthetized with inhalation of isoflurane
(∼1% to 4%) and anesthesia levels were monitored by any
overt signs of response to physical stimuli. Once anesthetized,
the head was shaved and immobilized in a KOPF stereotaxic
apparatus. The animal’s eyes were treated with ointment and
the body temperature was maintained by a heating pad. A sur-
gical scrub was done on the skin of the head using betadine and
rinsing with 70% ethanol. Next, using sterile instruments, a mid-
line scalp incision was made and the scalp was retracted.
A small craniotomy (0.5 to 1 mm) over the region of interest
was made using a dental drill. Next, the illumination and record-
ing was accomplished by lowering the composite probe to the
target location (CA3 of the hippocampus: X ¼ þ2.75 mm,
Y ¼ −2.54 mm, Z ¼ −2.60 mm, from bregma on the skull).
Functional details of the composite probe are described in this
paper. Clampex software was used for both recording field
signals and controlling the light source of the photonic probe.
