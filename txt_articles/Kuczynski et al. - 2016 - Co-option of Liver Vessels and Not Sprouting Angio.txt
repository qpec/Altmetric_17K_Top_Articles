Abstract
Background: The anti-angiogenic Sorafenib is the only approved systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). However, acquired resistance limits its efficacy. An emerging theory to explain intrinsic resistance to other anti-
angiogenic drugs is ‘vessel co-option,’ ie, the ability of tumors to hijack the existing vasculature in organs such as the lungs
or liver, thus limiting the need for sprouting angiogenesis. Vessel co-option has not been evaluated as a potential mechanism
for acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic agents.
Methods: To study sorafenib resistance mechanisms, we used an orthotopic human HCC model (n ¼ 4-11 per group), where
tumor cells are tagged with a secreted protein biomarker to monitor disease burden and response to therapy. Histopathology,
vessel perfusion assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and miRNA sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction were used to monitor changes in tumor biology.
Results: While sorafenib initially inhibited angiogenesis and stabilized tumor growth, no angiogenic ‘rebound’ effect was
observed during development of resistance unless therapy was stopped. Instead, resistant tumors became more locally
infiltrative, which facilitated extensive incorporation of liver parenchyma and the co-option of liver-associated vessels. Up to
75% (610.9%) of total vessels were provided by vessel co-option in resistant tumors relative to 23.3% (610.3%) in untreated
controls. miRNA sequencing implicated pro-invasive signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transition during
resistance development while functional imaging further supported a shift from angiogenesis to vessel co-option.
Conclusions: This is the first documentation of vessel co-option as a mechanism of acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic
therapy and could have important implications including the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting vessel co-option in
conjunction with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling.
The anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib
prolongs overall survival in advanced HCC (1,2). Sorafenib in-
hibits angiogenesis by targeting vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors and
may also directly target cancer cells by blocking the Ras-Raf-
MAPK pathway (3). Although 35% to 43% of HCC tumors are

 controlled by sorafenib treatment, ultimately these patients ac-
quire resistance and are taken off therapy (1,2).
One theory to explain resistance to angiogenesis inhibition
is VEGF-independent sprouting angiogenesis driven by numer-
ous pro-angiogenic growth factors and pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines that are upregulated during resistance to anti-VEGF
therapy (4–7). This mechanism has yet to be clinically validated.
For example, combined inhibition of VEGF and FGF has not pro-
ven successful in phase III HCC clinical trials (8). Moreover, stud-
ies that examined tumor perfusion in patients treated with TKIs
show that angiogenic re-induction occurs in only a subset of pa-
tients at progression (9–11). Analogous perfusion studies in HCC
patients progressing on sorafenib have not been reported.
Another potential mechanism of resistance to anti-angio-
genic therapy is vessel co-option: the recruitment of pre-exist-
ing vessels by the tumor (12). Vessel co-option has been
reported in liver metastases (13), non–small cell lung cancer,
and lung metastases (14,15), as well as other tumor types (12).
Nonangiogenic tumor growth, bearing resemblance to vessel
co-option, has also been reported in lymph node metastases
(16,17). The role of vessel co-option in mediating acquired resis-
tance to anti-angiogenic therapy is not established.
Rechallenging renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients with suni-
tinib or sorafenib, after progression on either drug, can prolong
progression-free survival (18,19), and sequencing of different
TKIs has shown efficacy in some patients (20). Although this ef-
ficacy may stem from the nonoverlapping kinase profiles of
these agents, another possible explanation is that resistance to
antiangiogenic TKIs is reversible, as reviewed by Kuczynski and
colleagues (21) and as reported by several groups (22–24).
The aim of the present study was to study the mechanistic
basis of acquired sorafenib resistance in vivo. Herein, we em-
ployed an orthotopic HCC model that recapitulates initial clini-
cal response and subsequent resistance to sorafenib and
displays a reversible phenotype, in that it cannot be transferred
to new hosts (22).
Methods
Orthotopic Mouse Model of HCC
We used a previously described orthotopic model of HCC where
Hep3B-hCG cells are injected into the liver of six-week-old male
CB17 SCID mice (25). Secreted urinary b-human choriogonado-
tropin (bhCG) protein levels normalized to urinary creatinine
served as a noninvasive biomarker for tumor burden (25).
Treatment with 30 mg/kg sorafenib per day was used, and we
incorporated therapy breaks to allow recovery from toxicity (22),
which are common in sorafenib-treated patients (1,2,26) and
thus reflect clinical toxicity management.
Tumor-bearing mice were assigned to a longitudinal ultra-
sound imaging study (n ¼ 24 initially) or a molecular/histological
analysis study (n ¼ 41 initially) then were treated daily with ve-
hicle or 30 mg/kg sorafenib by oral gavage. For molecular/histo-
logical
analysis,
representative
mice
demonstrating
initial
response and later acquired resistance were sacrificed at five
different phases (n ¼ 6/group) to assess sorafenib-sensitive and
acquired resistant HCC. “Control” and “sensitive” tumors were
sampled after 13 days of vehicle or sorafenib treatment, respec-
tively. More extended sorafenib treatment resulted in disease
progression in all remaining mice. Six mice were sampled at the
time of an individual ‘hCG progression’ (“early resistance”
group) on days 33 (1 mouse), 54 (3 mice), and 63 (2 mice). “Late
resistance” samples were obtained after 76 days of treatment.
Finally, samples were obtained from mice that had perma-
nently discontinued sorafenib from days 63 to 76 (“stop” ther-
apy group) in order to investigate potential factors that reverted
to baseline by stopping therapy.
In vivo imaging was performed pre-sorafenib or vehicle
treatment and at weeks 2, 5, 7, and 10 using a high-frequency
ultrasound instrument (Vevo 2100, VisualSonics, Inc.). Weeks 5,
7, and 10 corresponded to the development of acquired sorafe-
nib resistance. Control mice were sacrificed after two weeks of
vehicle treatment.
Experimental procedures were performed in accordance
with the Animal Care Committee and Comparative Research
Department of Sunnybrook Research Institute.
miRNA Sequencing and qRT-PCR
cDNA
libraries
were
prepared
from
tumors
(n ¼ 2/group).
Amplified cDNA was sequenced on the Hi-Seq 2500 (Illumina,
San Diego, CA). TargetScan 6.2 was used for recognizing miRNA
targets, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was subsequently used
to identify altered signaling pathways between sensitive and
control tumors. Total RNA was extracted from tumor lysates
(n ¼ 3/group) and analyzed for expression levels of EMT-related
genes by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR). Further details and primer sequences can be found
in Supplementary Materials (available online).
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Tumor protein lysates (n ¼ 6/group) were analyzed using en-
zyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA)
kits:
mouse
(m)VEGF-A (MMV00), human (h)VEGF-A (DVE00), mOPN (DY441),
mSDF-1 (DY460), mG-CSF (DY414), mAng2 (MANG20), mPDGF-
BB (MBB00), mPDGF-AB (MHD00), hbFGF (DFB50; all from R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and mAng1 (CSB-E0702m, Cusabio,
Hubei, China).
Statistical Analysis
Differences across experimental groups were evaluated by
Student’s t test or by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
multiple comparison test for differences across groups. Global
perfusion changes were tested by repeated measures one-way
ANOVA. Differences between the frequencies of peak enhance-
ment (PE) values at different time points were tested using two-
sample t tests. qRT-PCR results were analyzed by Kruskal-
Wallis followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test. Data are
presented as the mean and standard deviation of biological rep-
licates. Statistical significance level was set at a P value of less
than .05. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results
Characterization of Sorafenib-Resistant HCCs
Hep3B-hCG orthotopic HCC xenografts were used to study sora-
fenib resistance. Vehicle control HCC tumors rapidly progressed
as demonstrated by levels of urinary bhCG whereas all sorafe-
nib-treated mice initially displayed stabilized tumor growth.

 In Figure1A, the tumor growth rate (defined as the relative hCG
increase per day) for ‘control’ tumors was observed to be
72.4657.6 mIU/mg/day relative to responding mice at -0.96657.6
mIU/mg/day (P < .001). After 38 days of therapy, tumors began
to progress (hCG > 200 mIU/mg, hCG rate increase from 0.867.5
to 29.1614.6 mIU/mg/day, P < .001), reflecting resistance to ther-
apy (22). Sustaining treatment led to irregular hCG changes, but
permanently stopping therapy following resistance resulted in
accelerated tumor growth (147.66130.2 vs 38.7634.3 mIU/mg/
day, P < .001). Tumor samples were obtained to reflect control,
sorafenib-sensitive, early and late acquired resistance, and dis-
continuation of therapy postprogression (“stop”). Tumor plus
liver mass was statistically significantly higher in late resistant
vs sensitive tumors (t test P ¼ .001) in agreement with secreted
hCG levels (Supplementary Figure1A, available online).
Control tumors typically grew as smooth, red, hemorrhagic
nodules whereas sorafenib-treated tumors became white and
irregularly shaped (Figure 1B) and were highly necrotic except
for the tumor rim or small viable tumor cell islands within the
core. Control and stop tumors were mostly viable and filled
with red blood cell pools (Figure 1C). Sorafenib treatment statis-
tically significantly increased the percentage of necrotic tissue
(Figure 1C). Resistance was neither associated with induction of
cancer cell proliferation nor associated with decreased cancer
cell apoptosis (Figure 1D; Supplementary Figure 1B, available
online). Sorafenib-sensitive tumors did not have reduced levels
of ERK phosphorylation or cancer cell proliferation implicating

targeting
by
sorafenib
(Figure
1D;
Supplementary Figure 1C, available online) though, of note, sta-
tistically significantly reduced cancer cell proliferation was ob-
served by early resistance.
Analysis of Markers of Angiogenesis
We examined whether angiogenesis re-induction (4–7) might
explain acquired resistance to sorafenib. Tumors were co-
stained for CD34, a tumor endothelial cell marker in HCC (27)
and the pericyte marker a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA). CD34þ
microvessels
were
abundant
and
uniformly
distributed
throughout control tumors but were statistically significantly
depleted in sensitive and in resistant groups (Figure 2, A and B).
Resistant tumors lacked CD34þ vessel hotspots, indicating a
lack of rebound vascularization. However, persistent CD34þ
vessels were frequently associated with large auto-fluorescent
cells reminiscent of hepatocytes (Figure 2A; Supplementary
Figure 2A, available online). Stopping therapy caused CD34þ
vessels to return to control levels (Figure 2B). The proportion of
CD31 and Ki67-positive proliferating vessels mirrored this pat-
tern (Figure 2C). The proportion of aSMAþ pericyte-coated ves-
sels did not change statistically significantly between control or
sensitive and early resistance groups, arguing against enhanced
vessel maturation as a mechanism of resistance (Figure 2D).
aSMAþ myofibroblasts were a characteristic feature of stop tu-
mors, which surrounded NG2þ pericyte-covered CD34þ vessels
in multiple layers (Supplementary Figure 2, B and C, available
online) and formed extensive networks across stop tumors.
aSMAþ cells were also noted during late resistance in necrotic
areas of tumor (Supplementary Figure 2, C and D, available on-
line). Collagen I expression corresponded to areas of high fibro-
blast density. Collagen (I or III) deposition along the tumor-liver
interface was rare (Supplementary Figure 2E, available online).
Sorafenib treatment led to increased expression of the hypoxia
marker carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX (Figure 2, E and F). CAIX
expression appeared most extensive in sensitive tumors, sug-
gesting partial improvement of tumor oxygenation in resistant
tumors, but results were not statistically significant (P > .05).
Global Ultrasound Perfusion Imaging During
Sorafenib Treatment
We used ultrasound imaging to examine changes in tumor per-
fusion. The microbubble contrast agent used remains strictly in-
travascular, allowing accurate assessment of tumor perfusion
(28). Pretreatment and control Hep3B-hCG tumors were highly
perfused (Figure 3A), but contrast uptake was dramatically re-
duced by sorafenib treatment (Figure 3B).
To quantify global perfusion changes, peak enhancement
(PE) and wash-in rate (WIR), which are indicators of tumor blood
volume and flow rate, respectively, were measured from the
time intensity curve. Each declined statistically significantly af-
ter initial treatment but remained relatively unchanged after-
wards (Figure 3, C and D), indicating no evidence of rebound
reperfusion associated with sorafenib resistance.
Histopathological Signs of Local Invasion
Based on histopathological criteria defined for liver metastases
and HCCs (13,29), we observed that control and sensitive tumors
had a predominantly ‘pushing’ growth pattern characterized by
compression of the hepatocyte plates parallel to the tumor-liver
interface (Figure 4A). By early resistance, the tumor growth pat-
tern became highly infiltrative. Tumor ‘buds’ (cell clusters of � 5
cells in diameter [30]) and larger tumor nests were evident along
the invasive front, resulting in the incorporation of liver paren-
chyma into the tumor (Figure 4B). We also observed increased
lymphovascular invasion and hepatic satellite nodule develop-
ment during resistance (Figure 4, B and C), additional signs that
resistant tumors became more invasive.
Analysis of Vessel Co-option in Sorafenib-Treated HCCs
We hypothesized that invasive tumor growth and incorporation
of liver parenchyma in the absence of angiogenesis re-induction
meant that sorafenib-treated HCC tumor cells were co-opting
the normal liver vasculature (12). Tumors were co-stained for
CD31 (to detect all blood vessel types) and human lamin A/C (to
detect human cancer cells) and counterstained with hematoxy-
lin and eosin to reveal normal anatomical liver structures
(Figure 5A). This allowed us to identify five distinct types of ves-
sels in Hep3B-hCG tumors: 1) tumor-embedded vessels (TVs),
defined as CD31þ vessels bordered only by lamin A/Cþ tumor
cells (Figure 5B); 2) connective tissue vessels (CTVs), which were
CD31þ vessels bordered by fibroblasts (Figure 5B); 3) hepatocyte
vessels (HVs), which were CD31þ vessels bordered by hepato-
cytes (Figure 5C); 4) hepatic central veins (CVs) (Figure 5D); and
5) normal vessels of the portal triads (PTs) (Figure 5E; and
Supplementary Figure 3A). Because vessel types 3 through 5 are
vascular structures of the normal liver, their presence within
the tumor mass is evidence for vessel co-option.
We examined the abundance of these different vessel types
in control and sorafenib treated tumors. TVs and CTVs pre-
vailed in control tumors but were drastically reduced during
sensitive, early, and late resistance phases, respectively. These
vessels then statistically significantly rebounded in stop tumors
(Figure 5F). Similar data was obtained by normalization to total,
rather than viable tumor area (Supplementary Figure 3B,

 available online). In contrast, the quantity of HVs remained rel-
atively stable across groups; however, during early resistance
they statistically significantly outnumbered TVs (Figure 5F).
Portal triads and central veins were found across all tumor
groups, but their levels were more variable than HVs, with a
trend toward differences across groups (ANOVA P ¼ .14 and P ¼
.08, respectively) (Figure 5G). Relative to control tumors, the inci-
dence of PTs increased statistically significantly by late resis-
tance (P < .05). While HVs appeared to die and disappear in the
necrotic cores of resistant tumors large liver vessels did not,
thus appearing more stable (Supplementary Figure 3A, available
online). Importantly, HCC tumors switched to a blood supply
provided by vessel co-option, with 23.3610.3% of total vessels
provided by vessel co-option in control tumors to as high as
75.0610.9% provided by vessel co-option during early resistance
(Figure 5H). Stopping therapy caused a return of co-opted ves-
sels to baseline levels (Figure 5H).
MicroRNA Screen and Expression of EMT Pathway
Genes
We performed unbiased human microRNA sequencing on control,
sensitive, and late resistant tumors, followed by bioinformatic
analysis to identify pathways that were statistically significantly
upregulated during sorafenib resistance. Interestingly, four of the
top eight identified upregulated pathways were involved in cellu-
lar motility and invasion: axonal guidance, EMT, STAT3, and Wnt/
b-catenin signaling (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary
Figure 4A, available online).
Because of their potential contribution to increased HCC in-
vasion, we validated the expression of several EMT-related
genes by qRT-PCR. In late resistant vs control or sensitive tu-
mors, we observed statistically significant upregulation of tran-
scripts
for
vimentin,
ZEB1,
and
ZEB2
(both
pro-EMT
transcription factors) (Figure 6A). Loss of E-cadherin was ob-
served between control and sensitive groups (P < .05), but this
did not persist into resistance (Figure 6A). Statistically signifi-
cant changes in expression of Snail1, Snail2, and N-cadherin oc-
curred but were not clearly associated with resistance or
sorafenib sensitivity
and in some cases were downregulated
(Figure 6A; Supplementary Figure 4B, available online). We
noted a corresponding increase in vimentin protein expression
by cancer cells in late resistant compared with control tumors
(Figure
6B;
Supplementary
Figure
4C,
available
online).
Vimentin induction appeared to begin by early resistance (P >
.05 vs control or sensitive) when increased signs of invasiveness
became evident (Figure 4). Stop tumors were a hybrid of low-
and high-expressing areas, indicating a partial reversal in
vimentin expression upon therapy discontinuation (Figure 6B).

mouse. Red represents regions of high PE, blue are areas of low PE, and black represents no perfusion. C) Average PE values decreased statistically significantly two
weeks after sorafenib therapy (P < .001, †P < .001 vs pretreatment), but further changes were not statistically significant for the following weeks. No statistically signifi-
cant changes occurred in vehicle-treated mice (P ¼ .07) whereas a statistically significant change was observed between vehicle- and sorafenib-treated mice by week 2
(*P < .05). Vehicle control mice were sacrificed after week 2. D) Wash-in rate, used as an indicator of rate of blood flow, showed no statistically significant changes over
time, including during periods of drug resistance. Statistically significant changes were only observed between pre- and post-treatment for both sorafenib (P < .001, †P
< .001)- and vehicle (paired t test *P < .05)-treated groups. n ¼ 4 (vehicle), n ¼ 11 (sorafenib). Global perfusion changes were tested by repeated measures one-way analy-
sis of variance. Error bars represent standard deviation.

 with EMT, Hep3B-hCG cells adopted a mesenchymal morphol-
ogy during sorafenib treatment in vitro (Supplementary Figure
4D, available online). However, tumor cells did not acquire

(TVs), and connective tissue vessels (CTVs) are surrounded by tumor cells or fibroblasts, respectively. C) Hepatocyte-embedded vessels (HVs) were the most common
microvessel structures found in sorafenib-treated Hep3B-hCG tumors, varying from single-layered hepatocytes (left) to large patches of hepatocytes associated with
CD31þ vessels (right). Inset shows magnified HVs. D) Central veins (CVs), shown in the liver (left), were also observed in the tumor. E) The vessels of portal triads (PTs)
were also observed in the liver (left) as well as in the tumor. F) TVs were characteristic of control tumors, and they diminished during sorafenib treatment (analysis of
variance [ANOVA] P < .001, ‡P < .001 vs control and stop groups), after which HVs predominated (ANOVA P ¼ .53). After initial depletion by sorafenib treatment, CTVs
tended to re-emerge over time, particularly after stopping therapy (ANOVA P < .001). Examples shown are from control (B, left), stop (B, right), and early or late resistant
tumors (C-E). G) Tumor-incorporated PTs and CVs tended to increase in prevalence during treatment (ANOVA P ¼ .14 and P ¼ .08, respectively). H) The % co-opted

High-Resolution Contrast Ultrasound Imaging of
Sorafenib-Treated HCCs
We evaluated whether higher-resolution, contrast-enhanced
imaging
might
differentiate
between
tumor
perfusion
by
angiogenesis vs vessel co-option. Out-of-plane frames were re-
moved from contrast enhancement cineloops, and perfusion
parameters were extracted from 3x3 pixel areas, a methodology
that improved image resolution (Figure 7A). Networks of large
vessels were thus exposed spanning across sorafenib-treated
tumors. Structurally, similar networks were visible within the
same mice across time points, suggesting that some of these
vessels persisted prior to sorafenib treatment (Figure 7B). A
highly perfused (high-contrast) thin tumor rim developed after
five weeks of sorafenib treatment.
Based on histology of a parallel subset of tumors, the uni-
form high-contrast enhancement regions of control tumors cor-
responded to areas primarily occupied by tumor-embedded

 vessels whereas the hyper-intense rim of resistant tumors
mapped to the HV vessel–dense invasive tumor front, which
rarely contained TVs (Figure 7C). HV vessels appeared perfused
with red blood cells visible within their lumen (Supplementary
Figure 6, available online). Large vascular structures and nonper-
fused tumor regions corresponded to large liver vessels and areas
with high necrosis, respectively. Thus, the functional vasculature
correlated well with histological features, including the abun-
dance of co-opted vs non-co-opted vessel subtypes (Figure 5, F-H).
Notably, high tumor rim enhancement did not reflect regions of
angiogenic rebound but rather areas of vessel co-option.
A wide range of PE values was observed in both the tumor
and the liver, with distinct differences in their overall distribu-
tions (Figure 7D). Following initial sorafenib treatment, PE distri-
butions
shifted
dramatically
relative
to
untreated
tumors
(Figure 7D): A statistically significant increase in the frequency
of the lowest PE intervals (ie, to smaller capillaries, poorly or
nonperfused/necrotic tissues), as well as a decrease in 27 of the
other 29 PE intervals (P < .01), was observed. Over weeks 2 to 10
of
prolonged
sorafenib
therapy,
PE
distribution
remained
unchanged (Figure 7E). Distribution of functional vessels did not
take on control-like patterns, further supporting a lack of re-
bound angiogenesis during treatment, whereas the absence of
change in the PE distribution in the lowest intervals mimicked
the stability of HV densities. Thus, analysis of measured relative
blood volume (PE) shows patterns consistent with vessel co-op-
tion but not angiogenesis.
Discussion
Both preclinical and clinical evidence shows that tumors can
co-opt pre-existing blood vessels as well as, or instead of, utiliz-
ing angiogenesis (12). However, the role of vessel co-option in
acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy has not been ex-
plored. Based on the evidence presented here, we propose that
vessel co-option can facilitate acquired resistance to anti-angio-
genic therapy in HCC. Upon sorafenib treatment, tumors are de-
pleted of angiogenic vessels, but some co-opted pre-existing
vessels remain. While angiogenesis is continually suppressed,
the cancer cells then undergo EMT-like molecular changes that
enable them to infiltrate the liver parenchyma and co-opt
additional pre-existing liver vessels, ultimately facilitating re-
sistance and resumption of tumor growth. Many of these
changes are partially reversed by stopping therapy.
Our results have important implications. First, we show that
cancer cells acquire EMT-like properties without a full mesenchy-
mal switch, which facilitates infiltration of the liver tissue and
vessel co-option. Preclinical studies have shown that anti-angio-
genic therapy can increase local invasion (31,32) and resistant
HCC cells can undergo EMT during TKI treatment (33). Because
retrospective analyses showed that advanced metastatic disease
does not typically become more aggressive in patients treated
with angiogenesis inhibitors, the relevance of these findings has
been unclear (34). Moreover, the physiological relevance of EMT
during tumor progression is controversial (35,36). Most tumor
types do not lose epithelial characteristics, and they more fre-
quently invade and metastasize collectively as cell clusters rather
than as single cells (36,37). We propose that the increased local
invasiveness and changes in expression of epithelial and/or mes-
enchymal genes observed with anti-angiogenic therapy (which
may not be accompanied by increased metastasis) is physiologi-
cally relevant because it permits tumors to co-opt pre-existing
vessels. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is one potential media-
tor of this effect during sorafenib treatment (33), but at present
such molecular mechanisms are unknown.
Second, although we observed elevated expression of pro-an-
giogenic growth factors upon sorafenib treatment, we did not de-
tect
a
parallel
vascular
rebound
effect
as
assessed
by
global tumor perfusion or histology. Instead, regions of enhanced
perfusion during resistance corresponded with incorporated liver
parenchyma (ie, vessel co-option). The lack of angiogenic re-
bound in this model may explain why therapies designed to tar-
get VEGF-independent angiogenesis have failed in HCC (8).
Although the role of the observed upregulated secreted factors re-
mains unclear, two of the factors, osteopontin (OPN) and VEGF,
can stimulate HCC invasion (38,39), which may contribute to the
increased vessel co-option upon sorafenib treatment.
Studies examining tumor perfusion changes in patients who
have
acquired
resistance
to
anti-angiogenic
therapy
have
shown conflicting results. While some studies in RCC or glio-
blastoma patients suggest an angiogenic rebound (9–11), other
studies suggest changes that could reflect vessel co-option be-
cause tumors appear more invasive at progression (40) or

 contain ‘normal’ looking vessels (41). In agreement with the lat-
ter, our imaging data demonstrated a shift in vessel function
(peak enhancement) during sorafenib treatment that was main-
tained into resistance time points. This further suggests that a
switch from relying on angiogenesis to vessel co-option occurs
during acquired resistance to sorafenib in HCC.
The main limitation of this study was that only one preclini-
cal model was analyzed for potential resistance mechanisms.
We have also observed vessel co-option in a second sorafenib-
resistant orthotopic model using MHCC-97H cells (data not
shown); therefore, this phenomenon may be applicable to other
xenografts. A second limitation is the lack of corroborating data

 suggesting that vessel co-option occurs clinically in sorafenib-
resistant HCC patients. A ‘replacement’ growth pattern in which
sinusoidal vessels are co-opted by infiltrating HCC cells has
been observed in HCC patients (29,42).
In summary, increased local infiltration of cancer cells that fa-
cilitates vessel co-option may explain the reversible acquired re-
sistance phenotype observed in tumors treated with TKIs. To
prevent acquired resistance mediated by vessel co-option, it may
be necessary to combine anti-angiogenic therapy with drugs that
target tumor invasiveness. Combination with chemotherapy
might also be used to mitigate the pro-invasive effects of anti-an-
giogenic therapy (43). Alternatively, further research may reveal
that both angiogenic and co-opted vessels have some unique
properties that enable them both to be targeted.
