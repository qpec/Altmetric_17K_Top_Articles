Abstract
Objective: To assess household availability of NOVA food groups in nineteen
European countries and to analyse the association between availability of ultra-
processed foods and prevalence of obesity.
Design: Ecological, cross-sectional study.
Setting: Europe.
Subjects: Estimates of ultra-processed foods calculated from national household
budget surveys conducted between 1991 and 2008. Estimates of obesity prevalence
obtained from national surveys undertaken near the budget survey time.
Results: Across the nineteen countries, median average household availability
amounted to 33·9 % of total purchased dietary energy for unprocessed or
minimally processed foods, 20·3 % for processed culinary ingredients, 19·6 % for
processed foods and 26·4 % for ultra-processed foods. The average household
availability of ultra-processed foods ranged from 10·2 % in Portugal and 13·4 % in
Italy to 46·2 % in Germany and 50·4 % in the UK. A significant positive association
was found between national household availability of ultra-processed foods and
national prevalence of obesity among adults. After adjustment for national income,
prevalence of physical inactivity, prevalence of smoking, measured or self-
reported prevalence of obesity, and time lag between estimates on household
food availability and obesity, each percentage point increase in the household
availability of ultra-processed foods resulted in an increase of 0·25 percentage
points in obesity prevalence.
Conclusions: The study contributes to a growing literature showing that the
consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with an increased risk of diet-
related non-communicable diseases. Its findings reinforce the need for public
policies and actions that promote consumption of unprocessed or minimally
processed foods and make ultra-processed foods less available and affordable.

DAFNE
‘The issue is not food, nor nutrients, so much as proces-
sing’. With this title, a commentary published in 2009
presented a new paradigm to relate diet and health. It
proposed that food processing has become the main
shaping force of the global food system and the main
determinant of the nature of diets and related states of
health and well-being(1). As part of the new paradigm, a
classification of foods based on the nature, extent and
purpose of food processing was devised(1) and further
developed and called NOVA(2–4).
NOVA identifies as ultra-processed foods industrial food
and drink formulations made mostly or entirely from
substances derived from foods, together with additives.
The ingredients, the various processing techniques and the
sequences of stages used for the manufacture of ultra-
processed foods (hence ‘ultra-processed’) are designed to
create durable, accessible, convenient, hyper-palatable,
highly profitable ready-to-eat, ready-to-drink or ready-to-
heat products liable to displace all other NOVA food
groups – natural or minimally processed foods, processed
culinary ingredients and processed foods – and the dishes
and meals made with them(2–4).
Examples of typical ultra-processed foods are soft
drinks; sweet or savoury packaged snacks; confectionery,

 mass-produced packaged breads, buns, biscuits and
cakes; hot dogs, poultry and fish ‘nuggets’ and other
reconstituted meat products; ‘instant’ soups and noodles;
industrialized
desserts;
and
industrially
pre-prepared
pizzas, pies and other dishes and meals(2–4).
Analyses of national household food purchase surveys
and
national
dietary
surveys
conducted
in
several
countries(5–13) show a great variation in the estimates of
the dietary contribution of ultra-processed foods. These
ranged from 21·5 % of total dietary energy in Brazil in
2008–2009(9) to 57·9 % in the USA in 2009–2010(5). In 2003,
annual sales of selected ultra-processed foods in eighty
countries also have shown great variation, ranging from
6·7 kg per person in India to 307·2 kg per person in the
USA(14). From 2000 to 2013, in the eighty countries taken
together, the sales of these ultra-processed foods –
carbonated soft drinks, sweetened breakfast cereals, sweet
and savoury snacks, confectionery, ice cream, fruit juices,
sports and energy drinks, spreads, sauces, and ready
meals – increased by 43·7 %(14).
Studies of national diets undertaken in the USA, Canada,
Brazil and Chile have consistently shown that, as a group,
ultra-processed
foods
have
an
obesogenic
nutrient
profile(5,9,10,12,15–17). Associations between the dietary
content of ultra-processed foods and obesity have been
shown in two cross-sectional studies undertaken in
Brazil(18,19) and in one cohort study of middle-aged adults
in Spain(20). In twelve Latin American countries, a cross-
sectional time-series analysis in the period 2000–2013
revealed a strong correlation between annual changes in
sales of ultra-processed foods and annual changes in
population-average BMI(14). In Sweden, trends in sales of
ultra-processed foods paralleled the rise of obesity pre-
valence between 1960 and 2010(11).
The purpose of the present study was to assess
household availability of NOVA food groups in a large
number of European countries and to analyse the asso-
ciation between national availability of ultra-processed
foods and national prevalence of obesity among adults.
Methods
The studied countries
The present study involved nineteen European countries
for which we were able to obtain estimates for the same
year, or within an interval of up to 5 years, for household
availability of ultra-processed foods and also prevalence of
obesity among adults. These countries were Austria,
Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta,
Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and the UK.
Data sources on national household food availability
The data used to estimate the household availability of
ultra-processed foods in the UK were extracted from the
Living Costs and Food Survey (LCFS) conducted in the UK
in 2008(21). For the other countries, we extracted data from
the Data Food Networking (DAFNE), a data depository
of national household budget surveys conducted in
Europe(22). In this latter case, we always extracted data
from the most recent survey available for each country.
The DAFNE databank
DAFNE consists of data collected through standardized
national household budget surveys on all household
expenditures to calculate consumer price indices and to
analyse topics of social and economic interest(23). Multi-
stage stratified probability sampling procedures are used
by the surveys. During data collection, the members of the
participating households are asked to record all foods and
drinks acquired (purchased, produced and gifts) during a
certain period. The recording period is 14 d for all coun-
tries, except for Belgium, Germany and Sweden where it is
1 month. Foods and drinks consumed outside the house
(e.g. in restaurants and canteens) are not recorded. In all
countries, data collection is spread out over a year, which
captures seasonal variations.
The national data sets are then analysed centrally(24).
Survey data are read, cleaned and managed to a format
suitable for a between-countries analysis. To improve
comparability, food, demographic and socio-economic data
are subsequently classified under common groupings with
the application of criteria and iterative cross-coding allowing
the formation of operational classification schemes(24).
The data collected by DAFNE in each country refer to
quantities of foods (always including drinks) available for
household member consumption. The national daily per
capita household food availability is calculated by dividing
the total household availability by the number of days of
the referent time period and the total number of house-
hold members, without making allowances for waste or
food given to domestic pets(24). The results thus estimated
are stored in the DAFNE databank(22). Because the level of
detail recorded in each survey varies among countries,
ranging from very detailed records to those that are more
aggregated, food items in DAFNE are categorized into
fifty-six groups and average per capita household food
availability (in grams or millilitres) for each group is
provided for each country(22).
The LCFS databank
The LCFS provides estimates of household expenditures in
the UK. It is used primarily to provide information for the
national Retail Prices Index. This survey is similar to the
DAFNE surveys. The LCFS units of study are private
households
selected
by
multistage
stratified
random
sampling. The reference period for data on food is 14 d
and, as with DAFNE households, data collection is spread
evenly over the year. We coded the LCFS food items into
the same groups used by DAFNE and then the average
daily per capita household food availability (in grams or
Ultra-processed foods and obesity in Europe
19
 millilitres and also in dietary energy) for each group was
added to the LCFS database(21).
Data sources on obesity
National estimates of the prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥
30·0 kg/m2) among adults (people aged 18 years or
above, except for Belgium which includes people aged
15 years or above) for each of the nineteen countries were
derived from national surveys and were obtained from
peer-reviewed papers or official national reports (see
Table 2). The obesity estimate chosen for each country
was selected to match as close as possible the survey year
of the national household food budget survey. In nine
countries, the obesity estimate corresponded to the year of
the food availability estimate; in three, there was a gap of
1 year between the two estimates; in four, the gap was
of 2 years; in two, of 3 years; and in one, of 5 years
(as detailed below, this gap was treated as a potential
confounding factor in the association between national
food availability and national obesity prevalence).
Other variables used in the present study included
estimates of national gross domestic product (GDP) per
capita(25), prevalence of smoking(26) and prevalence of
physical inactivity(27). Physical inactivity was defined as
vigorous-intensity physical activity of less than 20 min/d
on at least 3 d/week, or moderate-intensity physical
activity of less than 30 min/d on at least 5 d/week. The
prevalence of smokers in Cyprus was not available and
was imputed using multiple imputation by chained equa-
tions(28,29), using as predictors GDP per capita, proportion
of population living in rural areas, proportions of indivi-
duals aged 0–14, 15–64 and 65 years or above, prevalence
of obesity and prevalence of physical inactivity.
Food classification
We have classified each of the fifty-six food groups in
DAFNE and LCFS databanks using NOVA. As said above,
NOVA is based on the nature, extent and purpose of the
industrial processing applied to foods before their con-
sumption(1–4). It includes four groups.
Of these, Group 1 is of unprocessed or minimally pro-
cessed foods, such as fresh, dry or frozen fruits and
vegetables; packaged grains and pulses; grits, flakes or
flours made from corn, wheat, rye; pasta, fresh or dry,
made from flours and water; eggs; fresh or frozen meat
and fish; fresh or pasteurized milk. Group 2 is of pro-
cessed culinary ingredients, including sugar, oils, fats, salt
and other substances extracted from foods or nature, used
in kitchens to season and cook unprocessed or minimally
processed foods and to make dishes and meals. Group 3 is
of processed foods, such as vegetables preserved in brine,
fruits in syrup, salted meat and fish, cheese, freshly made
unpackaged breads and other similar ready-to-consume
products manufactured with the addition to unprocessed
or minimally processed foods of salt, sugar, oil or other
substances of culinary use.
Group 4, of particular interest in the present study, is of
ultra-processed foods. These are industrial formulations
manufactured mostly or entirely from sugar, salt, oils and
fats, starches and many substances derived from foods but
not normally used in kitchens, and additives including
those used to imitate the sensory qualities of natural
foods or to disguise undesirable qualities of the final
product. Ultra-processed foods include sweet, fatty or salty
packaged snack products; ice cream, chocolate, candies;
mass-produced packaged breads, cookies, pastries, cakes;
breakfast cereals; ‘energy’ bars; preserves; margarines;
carbonated drinks, ‘energy’ drinks; milk drinks, including
‘fruit’ yoghurts; cocoa drinks; infant formulas, follow-on
milks,
other
baby
products;
‘health’
and
‘slimming’
products such as powdered or ‘fortified’ meal and dish
substitutes; and many ready-to-heat products including
pre-prepared pies and pizza dishes, burgers, hot dogs,
poultry and fish ‘nuggets’, and other reconstituted meat
products, and powdered and packaged soups, noodles
and industrial desserts. A detailed definition of each NOVA
food group, examples of food items classified in each
group and the rationale underlying the classification are
shown elsewhere(1–4,30,31).
Bread, frequently consumed by Europeans, may be
either processed or ultra-processed. Processed breads
include those made often by hand essentially from flour,
yeast, water and salt (nuts, dried fruits, vegetable oils,
butter and other culinary ingredients may also be added).
Ultra-processed breads are industrialised, and include
substances not used in kitchens, such as hydrogenated fat,
high-fructose corn syrup, emulsifiers, preservatives, and
flavours, colours and other additives used to make the
product more appealing. Since household budget surveys
do not describe the list of ingredients of food items, we
could not assess directly the shares of processed and ultra-
processed breads consumed in each country. We used
as a proxy the proportion of sales in each country of
‘artisanal bread’ and ‘industrial bread’, respectively, as
estimated by the Low Energy Ovens Market Study(32).
Data analysis
As a first step, we converted the national average daily per
capita household food availability (in grams or millilitres)
of each food item in each country, except the UK, into
energy values using the official US food composition
tables(33). In the case of the UK, all the food items in the
database were already converted to energy using the
official UK food composition table(22). Then we aggre-
gated similar items, such as different types of meat, of
vegetable oils, of cheeses, of sweetened drinks, and so on.
This aggregation resulted in nine subgroups within NOVA
Group 1, three within Group 2, four within Group 3 and
five within Group 4 (see Table 1). Due to the lack of
information related to the household availability of milk
and vegetable oils for Slovakia, the values for the average
daily per capita household availability of these two items
20
CA Monteiro et al.
 were imputed considering the median value of their
availability (kcal/person per d) in the other eighteen
countries.
The household availability of NOVA groups and sub-
groups in each country was expressed as a percentage of
total purchased dietary energy. The household availability
of ultra-processed foods in each country was plotted
against the estimate of the prevalence of obesity in the
same country, and models of crude and adjusted linear
regressions were then used to test the association between
these two variables. Potential confounding factors for this
association included countries’ GDP per capita, squared
GDP per capita, difference in years between the year of
the obesity survey and the household food budget survey,
a dummy variable for the method to assess obesity
(measured = 0; self-reported = 1), prevalence of physical
inactivity and prevalence of smoking.
All analyses used the statistical software package Stata
version 14.1.
Results
Table 1 shows the contribution of NOVA food groups and
subgroups to the average household food availability in
each of the nineteen countries.
The contribution of unprocessed or minimally pro-
cessed foods ranged from 26·4 % of total purchased
energy in Belgium and 27·6 % in Germany to 39·9 % in
Cyprus and 43·4 % in Portugal. Most purchased items in
this group were meat (from 4·9 % of total energy in Finland
to 10·4 % in France), milk (from 0·6 % of total energy in
Croatia to 10·7 % in Ireland), and pasta and wheat and
other flours (ranging from 2·0 % in Spain to 13·4 % in
Croatia).
Processed culinary ingredients contributed from 8·9 % of
total purchased energy in Belgium and 10·4 % in the UK to
26·8 % in Greece and 28·0 % in Italy. Most purchased items
were vegetable oils (from 0·7 % in Norway to 23·0 % in
Greece) and table sugar (from 2·8 % in Belgium to 9·2 % in
Slovakia).
Processed foods contributed from 8·7 % of total pur-
chased energy in Ireland and 10·2 % in the UK to 26·9 % in
France and 27·9 % in Slovakia. Most purchased items were
fresh breads (from 2·5 % in the UK to 22·4 % in Croatia)
and cheese (from 0·8 % in Ireland to 8·0 % in France).
Ultra-processed foods contributed from 10·2 % of total
purchased dietary energy in Portugal and 13·4 % in Italy to
46·2 % in Germany and 50·7 % in the UK. The most com-
monly consumed ultra-processed foods were packaged
breads (ranging from 1·6 % in Malta and Portugal to 16·3 %
in Ireland), cakes, cookies and other baked products
(ranging from 0·4 % in Croatia to 11·1 % in Belgium),
reconstituted meat products (ranging from 1·5 % in Greece
to 14·0 % in Germany) and sugar-sweetened beverages
(ranging from 0·1 % in Italy to 11·0 % in Latvia).
Across the nineteen countries, the median average
household
availability
amounted
to
33·9 %
of
total
purchased dietary energy for unprocessed or minimally
processed foods, 20·3 % for processed culinary ingredients,
19·6 % for processed foods and 26·4 % for ultra-processed
foods (data not shown).
Table 2 shows the prevalence of obesity among adults
(men and women together) in the nineteen countries in
the same year of (or close to) the assessment of household
food availability. Prevalence of obesity ranged from 7·1 %
in France and 8·2 % in Italy to 22·4 % in Finland and 24·5 %
in the UK.
Figure 1 shows the regression of the national prevalence
of obesity v. the national average household availability of
ultra-processed foods (percentage of total dietary energy).
Table 3 shows regression coefficients for the association
between the two variables. Both crude and adjusted
coefficients
were
positive
and
statistically
significant
(P < 0·05). The adjustment for potential confounders of the
association
between
ultra-processed
food
household
availability and obesity prevalence increased the regres-
sion coefficient.
In the adjusted models, each percentage point increase
in the household availability of ultra-processed foods
resulted in an increase of 0·25 percentage points in obesity
prevalence.
Discussion
In the current ecological study conducted with nationally
representative data from nineteen European countries we
found a significant positive association between house-
hold availability of ultra-processed foods and prevalence
of
obesity among
adults.
The
association
remained
significant, and its magnitude increased, after adjustment
for potential confounders. These included indicators
of national income, prevalence of physical inactivity,
prevalence
of
smoking,
measured
or
self-reported
prevalence of obesity, and time lag between the assess-
ment of food availability and of obesity prevalence.
After adjustment for potential confounders, our regres-
sion model predicted that each percentage point increase
in the energy share of ultra-processed foods would
result in an increase of 0·25 percentage points in obesity
prevalence. This means that a difference of 40 percentage
points in the average contribution of ultra-processed foods
to total household dietary energy, such as that existing
between Portugal in 2005 and the UK in 2008, would
determine a difference of 10 percentage points in obesity
prevalence. This is not far from the difference between the
actual prevalence of obesity in Portugal and the UK (15·2
and 24·5 %, respectively).
Previous
population-based
studies
undertaken
in
Europe and other parts of the world also have shown
positive
associations
between
the
consumption
of
Ultra-processed foods and obesity in Europe

 ultra-processed foods and obesity and other diet-related
chronic non-communicable diseases.
Dietary intake of ultra-processed foods was found to be
positively associated with 9-year incidence of overweight
and obesity(20) and of hypertension(34) in a prospective
cohort of Spanish middle-aged adult university graduates,
after adjustment for potential confounders (age, sex, marital
status, education level, baseline BMI, physical activity, hours
of television watching, sleeping/siesta, smoking, snacking
between meals and following a special diet) and after sen-
sitivity analyses that excluded participants with a family
history of obesity or hypertension and those with >3 kg
weight gain in the 5 years before entering the cohort.
A cross-sectional time-series analysis of nationally
representative data from twenty-five high-income coun-
tries (twenty of them European) in the period 1999–2008
found a positive association between per capita annual
changes in average fast-food transactions (mostly of ultra-
processed foods) and annual changes in age-standardized
mean BMI, after adjustment for GDP, urban population,
openness to trade, foreign direct investment, motor
vehicle use, physical activity, and vegetables and fruits
consumption(35). A similar analysis conducted in twelve
Latin American countries in the period 2000–2013 showed
a strong correlation between changes in national per
capita sales of ultra-processed foods and changes in
national population-mean BMI(14).
In
Brazil,
greater
household
availability
of
ultra-
processed foods was positively associated with higher
prevalence of excess weight and obesity in all age groups,
after control for several sociodemographic variables and
percentage of expenditures on eating out of home(18).
Another Brazilian study reported that adolescents and
adults in the highest quintile of intake of ultra-processed
foods had significantly higher average BMI and higher
odds of being obese than those in the lowest quintile, after
control for several socio-economic variables and physical
activity(19). Also in Brazil, a cohort study that followed
children from 3–4 to 7–8 years of age found that intake of
ultra-processed foods was associated with higher increa-
ses in total and LDL cholesterol, after control for several
socio-economic variables, energy intake and BMI(36).
A cross-sectional study found an association between
intake of ultra-processed foods and the metabolic syn-
drome in Brazilian adolescents after adjustment for
potential confounders (energy intake, smoking and family
history of dyslipidaemia)(37).

Fig 1 Regression of prevalence of obesity among adults v. household availability of ultra-processed foods (percentage of total
energy) in nineteen European countries (1991–2008)
Ultra-processed foods and obesity in Europe
23
 The association between consumption of ultra-processed
foods and obesity is consistent with the obesogenic
nutritional profile of these foods. Population-based studies
conducted in several countries have shown that, when
compared with the fraction of the diet made of non-
ultra-processed foods, ultra-processed foods overall have
higher energy density(9,10,12,13,15–17), higher content of free
sugars(5,9,10,12,13,15–17) and of total fats(9,10,12,13,16,17), and also
lower content of dietary fibre(9,10,12,13,15–17).
Also, ultra-processed foods are typically less satiating
and often have high glycaemic loads compared with other
foods(38). They are also aggressively marketed often in big
portion sizes and are typically designed to be consumed as
snacks rather than as regular meals. All these factors
induce energy overconsumption and thus overweight and
obesity(39–41).
The current paper presented results from the first cross-
national ecological study of the association between
ultra-processed food household availability and obesity in
Europe. The strength of the study is the reliance on
standardized data, the use of population-based, actual
(non-modelled) estimates of the prevalence of obesity,
and the consideration of multiple confounding factors.
The study has some limitations. First, close to half of the
national estimates of obesity relied on self-reported data
which are liable to underestimate the true prevalence of
obesity. To reduce this potential bias, the method used to
assess
obesity
(self-reported
or
directly
measured)
was included as a confounder in the adjusted linear
regression model. Second, food purchase surveys do not
include food consumed outside the home and do not
allow for food wastage in the home. This limitation was
reduced but not eliminated by use of a relative measure of
food consumption: the proportion of ultra-processed
foods in total dietary energy. Another limitation is that
the times when the household budget survey and the
obesity survey were conducted, although close, were not
the same for all countries. To minimize this limitation, the
number of years between the two surveys in each country
was entered into the model as a potential confounding
variable. An additional limitation was the use of a proxy to
assess the share of processed and ultra-processed breads in
each country. Sensitivity analyses undertaken after the
exclusion of Slovakia, for which some food data were
imputed, did not change the regression coefficients for the
relationship between national ultra-processed food house-
hold availability and national prevalence of obesity.
The fact that national estimates for household food
availability and obesity cover a large period of time (1991–
2008) and that some estimates are relatively old, should
not be considered a limitation of the study; its objective
was not to assess the association between the two
variables at one particular moment in time. Actually, the
use of estimates that covered a long period contributed to
increase the variability of both variables and this increases
the power of the study to examine the association
between them.
The present study contributes to a growing literature
showing that the consumption of ultra-processed foods is
associated with an increased risk of diet-related non-
communicable diseases. Its findings reinforce the need in
Europe, and in other parts of the world, for public policies
and actions designed to promote consumption of unpro-
cessed or minimally processed foods and dishes and meals
made with these foods, and to make ultra-processed foods
less available and affordable.
