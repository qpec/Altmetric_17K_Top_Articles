Abstract
OBJECTIVE—To evaluate a multimodal strategy aimed at treating all sites of disease that 
provides a rapid readout of success or failure in men presenting with non-castrate metastatic 
prostate cancers that are incurable with single modality therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS—Twenty selected men with oligometastatic M1a (extrapelvic 
nodal disease) or M1b (bone disease) at diagnosis were treated using a multimodal approach that 
included androgen deprivation, radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymphadenectomy 
(retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in the presence of clinically positive retroperitoneal nodes), and 
stereotactic body radiotherapy to osseous disease or the primary site. Outcomes of each treatment 
were assessed sequentially. Androgen deprivation was discontinued in responding patients. The 
primary end point was an undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after testosterone recovery. 
The goal was to eliminate all detectable disease.
RESULTS—Each treatment modality contributed to the outcome: 95% of the cohort achieved an 
undetectable PSA with multimodal treatment, including 25% of patients after androgen 
deprivation alone and an additional 50% and 20% after surgery and radiotherapy, respectively. 
Overall, 20% of patients (95% confidence interval: 3%–38%) achieved the primary end point, 
which persisted for 5, 6, 27+, and 46+ months. All patients meeting the primary end point had 
been classified with M1b disease at presentation.

 CONCLUSION—A sequentially applied multimodal treatment strategy can eliminate detectable 
disease in selected patients with metastatic spread at diagnosis. The end point of undetectable PSA 
after testosterone recovery should be considered when evaluating new approaches to rapidly set 
priorities for large-scale testing in early metastatic disease states and to shift the paradigm from 
palliation to cure.
A typical approach to developing a systemic treatment for cancer follows a paradigm in 
which studies begin in patients with advanced disease where unmet needs are greatest and 
survival times short. Therapies that are active are then studied in earlier disease states, 
culminating in large-scale trials that evaluate whether the systemic approach in combination 
with local therapy prevents or delays the time-to-event measures of disease progression or 
death in men with “high-risk” tumors predicted to recur after local therapy alone. Examples 
are the trials in localized disease that ultimately showed a survival benefit for radiation 
therapy to the prostate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus 
either one alone.1–4 Together, these trials enrolled 3000 patients who were followed for 6–12 
years to demonstrate the survival difference. Studies of radical surgery combined with ADT 
have shown that biochemical recurrence can be delayed, but no definitive effect on 
metastatic progression or survival has been shown.5,6 Now, with 6 life-prolonging systemic 
therapies available for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and olaparib 
given a breakthrough designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and on 
a fast-track for approval,7 there are too many possible combinations to test sequentially. New 
paradigms are needed so that more regimens can be evaluated rapidly and prioritized for 
large-scale phase 3 testing.
Here, we describe a multimodal treatment strategy of limited duration for men who present 
with low-volume metastatic disease that shifts the end point from time-to-event measures 
that occur late to measures of response that occur early. Because these patients are incurable 
with any form of monotherapy, the approach combines treatment directed at each 
manifestation of disease: (1) systemic therapy that includes ADT, (2) radical prostatectomy 
(RP) with pelvic lymph node (LN) dissection (+/− retroperitoneal dissection) to resect the 
primary and all detectable nodal disease, and (3) radiation therapy to visible osseous lesions 
or the prostate bed and LNs as clinically indicated. Systemic therapy is stopped in men who 
achieve an undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level to enable testosterone 
recovery. The primary end point, an undetectable PSA with non-castrate levels of 
testosterone at 20 months, is a response indicator that occurs early, is due solely to 
treatment, and is a requisite first step to show that the disease may have been completely 
eliminated. Once achieved and maintained over longer periods, this binary readout of a “no 
evidence of disease” (NED) state begins to establish the possibility of cure.
This end point was first used in a trial of rapid androgen cycling in a state of rising PSA in 
patients with biochemical recurrence after local therapy,8 and in a more recent randomized 
trial of complete androgen suppression with abiraterone and degarelix (NCT01751451). It is 
the same principle used to show that a clinically localized tumor has been completely 
removed (eliminated) surgically, and it aligns with the pathologic complete response end 
point used in neoadjuvant breast cancer trials to support regulatory approvals.9

 A 20-month landmark time to define “success or failure” is significantly shorter than the 42-
month median survival time in this population10 (which may be prolonged further as more 
agents become available), reducing both study duration and the sample size needed to show 
efficacy, and enabling more approaches to be evaluated rapidly and prioritized for large-
scale testing. We report our initial experience using the approach that has generated the 
information needed to guide the development of future protocols.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer who presented with extrapelvic nodal 
disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] M1a) or bone disease (M1b) 
evaluated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center within 6 months of diagnosis were 
considered. All underwent a complete history and physical examination, with laboratory 
studies that included a complete blood count, chemistry profile, and creatinine, serum 
testosterone, and PSA levels. Imaging included a prostate and pelvis magnetic resonance 
imaging, transaxial imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and Tc-99 radionuclide bone 
scan. Up to 10 bone metastases based on bone scintigraphy or non-regional LN involvement 
were allowed. Patients were excluded if they had evidence of pelvic sidewall invasion, 
visceral disease, or metastases to the pelvic LN only (AJCC N1). Before undergoing 
treatment, all patients provided written informed consent to proceed with RP according to 
the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, with the understanding that RP plus 
pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (pelvic lymph node dissection [PLND] and 
retroperitoneal lymph node dissection [RPLND], respectively) had not been proven for M1 
patients to prolong survival but could possibly provide locoregional control and 
symptomatic relief.
Interventions
ADT—All patients were started on ADT followed by surgery and radiation, or radiation 
followed by surgery. ADT was stopped after a minimum duration of 6 months if an 
undetectable PSA was achieved after combined modality therapy. Other patients were 
treated continuously.
Surgery—The surgical procedure was designed to resect all gross disease in a single stage 
and included bilateral PLND (external iliac, obturator, and hypogastric nodes) and open or 
robot-assisted laparoscopic RP. Nerve sparing was performed in some patients at the 
discretion of the surgeon. Radiographically evident nodal metastases (>2 cm) above the 
bifurcation of the common iliac vein were resected through an open approach by a second 
surgical team performing template-directed retroperitoneal RPLND that included the left 
para-aortic, preaortic, retroaortic, inter-aortocaval, paracaval, precaval, retrocaval, common 
iliac, and pre-sacral LNs.
Radiation Therapy—Hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) was 
considered for patients with metastatic bone lesions. The lesions were treated to total doses 
ranging from 2000 to 3000 cGy delivered over 1 to 5 fractions encompassing the primary

 lesion, with a small (3 mm) margin for setup error. Based on the pathologic findings at 
surgery, postoperative radiation to the prostate bed +/− pelvic LNs or para-aortic LNs was 
given with conventional fractionation schedules using intensity-modulated radiotherapy at 
doses ranging from 6600 to 7200 cGy after RP.
Outcomes of Therapy
Outcomes were reported separately by modality and disease manifestation for patients with 
M1a (extrapelvic nodal disease) and M1b (bone disease with or without soft tissue disease). 
PSA changes were reported as whether or not an undetectable level (<.05 ng/mL) was 
achieved following each sequential therapy. Imaging changes were classified per the Prostate 
Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria.11 Later tumor-related events included time 
to PSA recurrence, local recurrence, or objective progression by imaging in a preexisting 
lesion or a new site of disease, or the development of symptoms.
Surgery—Surgical outcomes included pathologic TNM stage, margin status, number of 
LNs removed and the number with cancer, and postoperative PSA levels. Safety measures 
included operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay. Continence rates (defined as 
dry without use of pads) at 12 months were also assessed.
Radiation Therapy—Changes in PSA were reported as outlined, along with relief of 
symptoms if present.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and proportions, and continuous 
variables as medians and ranges.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Extent of Disease
The baseline characteristics of the 20 patients treated (5 with extrapelvic nodal disease 
[M1a] and 15 with bone disease [M1b]) are summarized in Table 1. Overall, 14 (70%) 
primary tumors were classified as T3a or greater, and clinically positive pelvic nodes (N1) 
were seen in 5 M1a patients (100%) and 6 M1b patients (40%). The median number of bone 
metastases was 3 (range: 1–7).
Details of Treatment
Systemic Therapy—All patients received ADT as initial therapy, with a median of 4 
months (range: 2–9) prior to RP. All those in whom primary ADT was discontinued (n = 16) 
received it for a median of 11 months (range: 6–16), as shown in Table 1.
Surgery
M1a (Extrapelvic Nodal Disease)—All 5 patients had an RP and bilateral PLND, and 4 
also had RPLND at a median of 5 months (range: 3–9) after diagnosis. At surgery, a median 
of 17 pelvic LNs (range: 11–25) and 40 retroperitoneal LNs (range: 22–48) per patient were 
removed (Table 2). Pathologic pelvic LN involvement was documented in 4 cases (80%);

 M1a status was confirmed in 3, with a median of 21 (range: 0–30) positive nodes. The 
median operative time was 390 minutes (range: 236–618). There was one grade 3 
complication (Clavien-Dindo classification): a suspected intraoperative ureteral injury 
requiring stent placement. All 5 patients were continent by 12 months after surgery.
M1b (Bone Disease)—All 15 patients had an RP and bilateral PLND at a median of 5 
months (range: 3–11) after diagnosis. All were resectable, although 2 (13%) had positive 
margins. A median of 17 pelvic nodes (range: 9–25) were removed, of which a median of 1 
(range: 0–9) was found to be malignant. In the 2 patients who had RPLND, 23 and 27 
retroperitoneal nodes were removed, of which 0 and 14, respectively, had tumor. Clinical 
and pathologic staging of the primary tumor was discordant in 11 patients (73%), whereas N 
staging was discordant in 5 (33%) (Table 2). The median operative time was 252 minutes 
(range: 150–323 for RP + PLND and 386–500 minutes for RP + PLND + RPLND). There 
were two grade 3 complications: 1 pelvic abscess requiring drain placement and 1 
anastomotic leak. Thirteen of 14 patients (93%) with follow-up of at least 12 months were 
continent.
Radiation Therapy
M1a (Extrapelvic Nodal Disease)—One patient who did not undergo RPLND received 
radiation to his para-aortic LN in addition to radiation to the prostate bed for positive 
surgical margins.
M1b (Bone Disease)—Twelve patients (80%) received hypofractionated SBRT to 
osseous metastases, which encompassed all visible disease on bone scan in 10. Most patients 
were treated at 1–3 sites of bone metastasis, and 3 patients were treated at 4 or 5 sites. Of 
these, 10 were treated postoperatively after a median of 4 months (range: 2–15) of ADT, and 
2 patients with symptoms were treated preoperatively. Three patients (20%) were not treated 
initially: 1 had a negative biopsy, which later proved positive and was subsequently treated, 
1 was denied insurance coverage and treated later for symptoms, and the third was not 
treated because of disease extent.
Two patients (13%) received postoperative radiation to the prostate bed and pelvic LN basins 
based on surgical findings of grossly positive margins or nodal disease with extranodal 
extension. There were no significant treatment-related adverse events related to radiation.
Outcomes: Post-therapy PSA Changes and Clinical Response
M1a (Extrapelvic Nodal Disease)—None of the 5 patients achieved an undetectable 
PSA after ADT alone, but 4 (80%) did so after surgery. The fifth patient, who did not have 
an RPLND, had a persistently elevated PSA post-RP that became undetectable after 
radiation to the para-aortic LNs (Figs. 1, 2). ADT was discontinued in 4 (80%) but restarted 
for PSA progression after a median time of 6 months (range: 0–15). None achieved the 
primary end point of undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery at 20 months after 
initiation of therapy (Table 3), although 1 patient had a PSA of <.05 ng/mL with a 
testosterone level of 47 ng/dL at 39 months. With a median follow-up of 34 months, 
castration-resistant disease developed in 2 patients (40%) at 18 and 32 months. Two (40%)

 progressed radiographically: in the prostate bed and retroperitoneum in 1 patient, and bone 
and lung in the other. There was 1 death from prostate cancer at 24 months from the start of 
therapy.
M1b (Bone Disease)—Five (33%) achieved an undetectable PSA with ADT alone, 
whereas 9 (60%) reached a nadir of <0.2 ng/mL and 13 (87%) a nadir of <1.0 ng/mL. After 
surgery, PSA in an additional 6 (total: 73%) became undetectable (Figs. 1, 2). Seven patients 
had a PSA of <.05 ng/mL before radiation therapy, which was maintained in 6 after 
radiation. Another 7 had elevated PSA levels, which became undetectable in 4 after 
radiation. When considering the best overall PSA response during the treatment phase, 14 of 
15 M1b patients (93%) reached an undetectable PSA when ADT, surgery, and radiation were 
used (Fig. 2). Ultimately, 4 (27%) achieved the proposed end point, a PSA of <.05 ng/mL 
and serum testosterone of >150 ng/dL at 20 months after the start of ADT (Table 3), which 
remained undetectable in 2 patients for 27 and 46 months, respectively. Overall, with a 
median follow-up of 47 months, castration-resistant disease has been documented in only 8 
patients (53%; 95% confidence interval: 24%–81%) at a median of 23 months (range: 14–
54). There was 1 death from prostate cancer at 59 months from the start of therapy.
DISCUSSION
The results of this pilot study show that a multimodal treatment strategy can eliminate all 
detectable disease in patients with metastatic disease at presentation who are considered 
incurable with any single form of therapy. The approach includes treatment of all visible 
disease, building on the ADT standard for metastatic disease by adding radical surgery to 
resect the primary tumor and LNs, SBRT to treat visible lesions, and intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy to prostate bed and nodal basins in patients at high risk of recurrence in these 
locations. Overall, 20% of the patients treated had an undetectable PSA and non-castrate 
levels of testosterone at 20 months, an end point that could not have been achieved with any 
single therapy alone. Although longer follow-up is needed to assess durability, this binary 
end point represents a first step toward establishing a paradigm of cure in patients with low-
volume metastatic disease.
The sequential use of the 3 different modalities helped illustrate the role and importance of 
each in achieving the undetectable PSA end point, which represents an NED status, in 
patients with soft tissue only (M1a) and those with osseous +/− soft tissue disease (M1b). It 
is notable that none of the 5 M1a patients achieved an undetectable PSA following ADT 
alone, but 4 (80%) achieved an undetectable PSA after RP + PLND + RPLND (Figs. 1, 2). 
In contrast, 14 of the 15 M1b patients (93%; 95% confidence interval: 77%–100%) achieved 
an undetectable PSA: 5 after ADT alone, 6 more after RP + PLND, and 3 more after SBRT 
to metastatic lesions. This is consistent with reports demonstrating the inability of systemic 
therapy alone to eliminate disease in either the primary or metastatic sites,12–14 and 
highlights the need to treat each site of disease in order to reach the NED end point. Failure 
to achieve an undetectable PSA was associated with early relapse, consistent with the 
Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 9346 trial, which showed that the failure to achieve a 
PSA nadir of <0.2 ng/mL after ADT was associated with inferior survival times.15 
Consistent with the multimodal approach of treating all visible disease, bone metastases

 were treated with SBRT. Recent data show that at least short-term local tumor control can be 
achieved by this approach in 79%–99% of patients with limited bone metastasis, depending 
on treatment dose.16,17
Whether treatment of the primary tumor in the setting of metastatic disease provides long-
term benefit remains an open question in prostate cancer research.18,19 It is, however, the 
standard of care in the management of other urologic cancers, including urothelial,20 
testicular,21 and renal cell carcinoma,22 where surgical resection of disease to achieve a 
complete remission status provides incremental cures. It is also becoming more prevalent in 
non-genitourinary malignancies, likely due to multiple factors including better systemic 
therapies and decreased perioperative morbidity as a result of improved patient selection.23 
Men with N1 disease treated with RP have a reduced risk of death from prostate cancer 
compared to those treated with non-curative therapies.24,25 A reduction in prostate cancer-
specific mortality in men with M1 disease whose primary tumor is treated definitively has 
also been shown in population-based studies,26–28 and the feasibility of RP in this 
population has been established.29,30 Prospective trials to test this question are combining 
surgery or radiation with “best systemic therapy” (NCT01751438) or radiation to the 
primary tumor with systemic therapy (NCT00268476, NCT01957436, and NTR271). Over 
time, these trials may ultimately demonstrate a survival benefit from local therapy in 
metastatic disease, but as the end points are time-to-event measures that occur late, the 
readouts of success or failure will take years, and the number of regimens that can be tested 
are limited.
Using undetectable PSA with non-castrate testosterone, or NED, as the primary measure of 
treatment efficacy contrasts with the more traditional time-to-event measures used in early-
state trials—including time to PSA progression or recurrence, metastatic progression, or 
death—which typically require large numbers of patients to be followed for long periods of 
time and often provide uncertain results that do not impact practice. For example, docetaxel 
was approved for treatment of mCRPC in 2004, and was shown to prolong survival in 
combination with ADT (vs ADT alone) for men with metastatic non-castrate disease in the 
CHAARTED and STAMPEDE trials in 2014 and 2015, respectively.31,32 Establishing the 
role of ADT + docetaxel in men with high-risk localized disease has proven to be more 
challenging. GETUG 12 explored this question using a similar regimen but required 13 
years from activation to reporting to show an absolute 8% difference in progression-free 
survival events, most of which were PSA recurrences of uncertain clinical significance.33 
The first report of STAMPEDE showing a clear survival benefit for patients with metastatic 
disease did not show the same benefit for patients with “low-volume” disease.34 In both 
trials, there were too few events to show a difference in overall survival, an end point that in 
itself is becoming even more difficult to demonstrate because of the availability of multiple 
life-prolonging treatments for patients after they have completed treatment on a protocol.
Limitations to the general application of the results of this pilot study include the highly 
selected nature of the patients treated and small sample size in this pilot experience. 
Nevertheless, that 4 patients achieved the end point of an undetectable PSA with non-
castrate levels of testosterone at 20 months demonstrates that achieving an NED state with a

 multimodal approach is possible, and suggests a threshold on which to power larger trials 
evaluating recently approved life-prolonging agents in this context.
The NED state we describe here is a binary response indicator resulting solely from 
treatment that occurs in under 2 years and is a requisite first step toward establishing a cure 
paradigm. It is justified by the level of activity seen with the approved and generally 
available life-prolonging systemic therapies for men with mCRPC, which are comparable 
with those seen in other tumor types that can result in cure when used earlier in the disease 
course. It is necessary because of the large number of potential combinations in need of 
testing and the need for an objective methodology to rank and prioritize them for large-scale 
testing. Because of the novelty of the end point—an undetectable PSA with non-castrate 
testosterone levels—and the recognition that the benchmark for what is considered sufficient 
activity is evolving, a multi-arm randomized (phase 2) clinical trial framework with a 
concurrent control will enable new experimental approaches to be added at any time. 
Whether the end point translates into durable oncological benefit is an open question and 
will require validation in phase 3 clinical trials, but combined with the proposed multimodal 
treatment strategy it will ensure the timely evaluation of multiple strategies so that only the 
most promising ones are moved forward. Regimens that do not result in an NED state are 
unlikely to translate into durable responses and can be de-prioritized.
CONCLUSION
A multimodal treatment strategy for patients who present with disease that is beyond the 
limits of curability by any single modality enables the evaluation of new approaches in order 
to prioritize large-scale testing in early stages of advanced disease. The end point, an 
undetectable PSA with non-castrate testosterone levels, also shifts the paradigm from 
palliation to cure.
