Key Points
• Enasidenib, a selective
inhibitor of mutant IDH2
enzymes, was safe and well
tolerated in patients with
IDH2-mutated myeloid
malignancies.
• Enasidenib induced
hematologic responses in
patients with relapsed/
refractory AML in this dose-
escalation and expansion
study.
Recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) occur in ∼12% of patients with
acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mutated IDH2 proteins neomorphically synthesize 2-
hydroxyglutarate resulting in DNA and histone hypermethylation, which leads to blocked
cellular differentiation. Enasidenib (AG-221/CC-90007) is a first-in-class, oral, selective
inhibitor of mutant-IDH2 enzymes. This first-in-human phase 1/2 study assessed the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, safety,
and clinical activity of enasidenib in patients with mutant-IDH2 advanced myeloid
malignancies. We assessed safety outcomes for all patients and clinical efficacy in the
largest patient subgroup, those with relapsed or refractory AML, from the phase 1 dose-
escalation and expansion phases of the study. In the dose-escalation phase, an MTD was
not reached at doses ranging from 50 to 650 mg per day. Enasidenib 100 mg once daily
was selected for the expansion phase on the basis of pharmacokinetic and pharmaco-
dynamic profiles and demonstrated efficacy. Grade 3 to 4 enasidenib-related adverse
events included indirect hyperbilirubinemia (12%) and IDH-inhibitor–associated differ-
entiation syndrome (7%). Among patients with relapsed or refractory AML, overall
response rate was 40.3%, with a median response duration of 5.8 months. Responses
were associated with cellular differentiation and maturation, typically without evidence of aplasia. Median overall survival among
relapsed/refractory patients was 9.3 months, and for the 34 patients (19.3%) who attained complete remission, overall survival was
19.7 months. Continuous daily enasidenib treatment was generally well tolerated and induced hematologic responses in patients for
whom prior AML therapy had failed. Inducing differentiation of myeloblasts, not cytotoxicity, seems to drive the clinical efficacy of
enasidenib. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01915498. (Blood. 2017;130(6):722-731)
Introduction
Advances in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) over the
past4decades have been limited.In younger adultswithde novo AML,
overall survival at 5 years is 40% to 50%.1 Prognosis is significantly
worse for older patients, those with secondary AML evolved from
antecedent myeloid neoplasms, and those with relapsed or refractory
disease, who have a 5-year survival rate of only 5% to 10%.1-3 How-
ever, an increasing understanding of molecular aberrations that trigger
the development of AML, and growing use of next-generation se-
quencing, are advancing the development of investigational drugs
against potential driver mutations in AML.

From 
 Recurrent mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 genes
(IDH1, IDH2) are found in myeloid malignancies.4,5 Enasidenib (AG-
221/CC-90007) and ivosidenib (AG-120) are first-in-class, oral,
selective, small-molecule inhibitors of IDH2- and IDH1-mutant
enzymes, respectively. IDH2 mutations are relatively common in he-
matologic malignancies, occurring in ;12% of patients with AML,6,7
are enriched in patients with normal karyotype, and increase in fre-
quency with age.8-10
IDH2 enzymes catalyze conversion of isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate
(aKG) in the mitochondria. Mutations within the conserved enzymatic
active sites, R140 and R172, produce neomorphic activity, reducing
aKG to R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2-HG).7 In preclinical models,
increased levels of R-2-HG competitively inhibit aKG-dependent
enzymes, leading to histone and DNA hypermethylation, chromatin
modifications, and altered hypoxia responses.11-13 High R-2-HG con-
centrations are associated with differentiation arrest of hematopoietic
cells in vivo,14 and R-2-HG levels are substantially increased in the
sera of patients with mutant-IDH2 malignancies.15-17
In preclinical studies, enasidenib-induced inhibition of aberrant
IDH2 protein decreased total serum 2-HG by more than 90%, re-
duced abnormal histone hypermethylation, and restored myeloid
differentiation.18-20 Enasidenib was also associated with a dose-
dependent survival advantage in a primary AML xenotransplant
model.20 Enasidenib seems to act as a differentiation agent and is not
cytotoxic. Bone marrow blasts from patients with mutant-IDH2 AML
exposed to enasidenib ex vivo produce mature, fully functioning
neutrophils with conserved mutant IDH2 allele frequency, indicating
that the mature cells evolved from the mutant IDH2 blasts.20Moreover,
no apoptosis was observed in mutant-IDH2-R140 erythroleukemia
(TF-1) cells treated with enasidenib for 7 days in vitro.20
This first-in-human, phase 1/2 study assessed the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pro-
files, safety, and clinical activity of enasidenib in patients with
mutant-IDH2 advanced myeloid malignancies (NCT01915498;
Phase 1/2 Study of AG-221 in Subjects With Advanced Hematologic
Malignancies With an IDH2 Mutation). We report an overview of the
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of enasidenib,
safety outcomes for all patients in the dose-escalation and phase 1
expansion portions of this study, and clinical efficacy in patients with
relapsed/refractory AML, the largest subgroup of patients in this
study.
Methods
This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The trial was designed and
monitored by the sponsors, Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cambridge, MA)
and Celgene Corporation (Summit, NJ), along with the study investigators.
The protocol was approved by local human investigations committees at
participating sites. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients
before screening.
Patients
Patientsage18yearsorolderwithmutant-IDH2advancedmyeloidmalignancies
and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 were
eligible. Patients had a confirmed diagnosis (per World Health Organization
2008 classification21) of AML or of myelodysplastic syndromes with refractory
anemia with excess blasts. IDH2 mutational status was evaluated locally at
screening. Retrospective central review with investigational use of the Abbott
RealTime IDH2 polymerase chain reaction–based assay and Abbott m2000rt
technology (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) showed high concordance with
local assessments.
Study design
The primary objective was to determine the safety and MTD of enasidenib.
Secondary objectives included characterizing the pharmacokinetic and pharma-
codynamic profiles and clinical activity of enasidenib.
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated during treatment cycle 1.
A single enasidenib dose was administered on day 23, followed by a 2-day
pharmacokinetic evaluation period. Enasidenib was then administered orally
once or twice per day in continuous 28-day cycles.
Dose-escalation was followed by an expansion phase comprising 4
cohorts of patients with IDH2 mutations, including those age 60 years or
older with relapsed/refractory AML, or any age if they relapsed after he-
matopoietic cell transplantation; age younger than 60 years with relapsed/
refractory AML and no prior transplantation; age 60 years or older with
untreated AML and ineligible for induction chemotherapy; or ineligible for
other expansion arms.
Study assessments
For the first 3 patients enrolled in a cohort during the dose-escalation phase of
the study and the first 15 patients enrolled in each arm of the expansion phase,
a single dose of enasidenib was administered on day 23 (ie, 3 days before
the scheduled cycle 1 day 1 dose). Blood samples were drawn before single-
dose administration of enasidenib (within 30 minutes) and at the following
time points after administration for determining concentration-time profiles of
enasidenib: 30 (610) minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours (610 minutes),
and 24, 48, and 72 hours (61 hour) postdose. After 72 hours of blood sample
collection, patients began continuous oral daily dosing of enasidenib on cycle
1 day 1. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by using noncompart-
mental analysis (NCA) methods.
In the dose-escalation phase, 5 enasidenib dose levels were administered
twice per day (30, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mg), and 8 dose levels were administered
once per day (50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 450, and 650 mg). Serial blood
sampling for assessment of 2-HG concentrations was performed predose in cycle
1 on days 1, 8, and 15; in cycles 2 and 3 on days 1 and 15; and on day 1 of cycle
4 and every cycle thereafter. The potential relationship between plasma levels
of enasidenib and 2-HG was assessed by using WinNonLin software
(Pharsight, Mountain View, CA).
Treatment-emergentadverseevents(TEAEs),definedaseventsthatbeganor
worsened between the first enasidenib dose and 28 days after the last dose, were
graded by using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
Serious TEAEs were those that were life-threatening, resulted in death, required
hospitalization, or caused significant incapacity.
Efficacy outcomes are reported for the subgroup of patients with relapsed/
refractory AML. Hematologic response was determined by investigator
review of peripheral blood and bone marrow samples in accordance with
modified 2003 International Working Group criteria for AML.22 Overall
response rate (ORR) included complete remission, complete remission with
incomplete hematologic or platelet recovery, partial remission, and mor-
phologic leukemia-free state. Overall survival was defined as the time from
first enasidenib dose to death by any cause. Event-free survival comprised the
interval between first enasidenib dose and relapse ($5% bone marrow blasts,
reappearance of blasts in blood, or development of extramedullary disease),
disease progression, or death.
Statistical analysis
Dose-escalation was performed by using a standard 313 design. If 2 or more
patients within a 6-person cohort experienced a DLT, the previous dose was
considered the MTD. Planned enrollment in the expansion phase was 25 patients
in each of the 4 arms to provide a 93% probability of detecting TEAEs with an
underlying rate of 10%, and a 72% probability of detecting TEAEs with an
underlying rate of 5%. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hematologic
response are from a 2-sided exact binomial test. Overall survival and 1-year
survival rates were estimated by using Kaplan-Meier methods.

 Results
Between September 20, 2013, and April 15, 2016, 239 patients (113 in
thedose-escalationphaseand126inthe4-armexpansionphase)received
enasidenib and comprised the intention-to-treat population. At data
cutoff, 31 patients (13%) continued to receive enasidenib on-study, with
median follow-up of 9.7 months (range, 3.7-20.8 months) (supplemental
Figure 1, available on the Blood Web site). Baseline characteristics are
provided in Table 1. Three-fourths of all patients had IDH2-R140
mutations and one-fourth had IDH2-R172 mutations. Of 175 patients
with available cytogenetic data, 67% had National Comprehensive
Cancer Network–defined23 intermediate-risk cytogenetics, including
43% with normal karyotype. The relapsed/refractory AML efficacy
cohort comprised 176 patients (74% of all patients). At study entry, 94
patients (53%) had received 2 or more prior AML-directed regimens.

 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
Enasidenib demonstrated high dose–proportional plasma exposure and
anextendedhalf-life(;137hours)aftermultipledoses,reachingsteady
state by cycle 2 day 1. A 100 mg once-per-day dose was chosen for the
study expansion on the basisof robuststeady-statedrug concentrations,
plasma 2-HG inhibition, and clinical activity. By cycle 2 day 1, en-
asidenib 100 mg per day reduced plasma 2-HG levels from baseline by
amedianof93%andamaximumof99%inpatientswithIDH2-R140Q
mutations and by 28% and 94% in patients with IDH2-R172K
mutations (supplemental Figure 2). No dose-dependent 2-HG in-
hibition was observed among doses below, at, or above 100 mg.
Median 2-HG suppression from baseline was 92.4%, 90.4%, and
93.1%forthosereceivingenasidenibdosesoflessthan100mg,100mg,
and greater than 100 mg, respectively.
Safety
Thesafety-evaluablepopulationcomprisedall239patients.Enasidenib
doses of 50 mg to 650 mg per day were evaluated. The median number
of enasidenib treatment cycles received was 5.0 (range, 1-25 cycles).
Enasidenib was generally well tolerated; the MTD was not reached at
doses of up to 650 mg once per day. Prolonged dosing with
enasidenib 650 mg once per day was not well tolerated; 5 of 7 patients
in this dose group had a dose reduction or modification as a result of
treatment-related TEAEs that did not qualify as DLTs (supplemental
Table 1).
Nearly all patients (n 5 238) experienced a TEAE, and 195 patients
(82%) experienced a treatment-related TEAE. The most common
treatment-related TEAEs were indirect hyperbilirubinemia (38%) and
nausea (23%) (supplemental Table 2); these were also the most com-
mon TEAEs regardless of cause (supplemental Table 3). Enasidenib-
related grade 3 to 4 TEAEs occurred in 99 patients (41%), the most
common being indirect hyperbilirubinemia (12%) and IDH-inhibitor–
associated differentiation syndrome (IDH-DS) (6%) (the preferred term
was “retinoic acid syndrome” because IDH-DS was not an established
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred term when
this study was conducted) (Table 2). Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related
hematologicTEAEsandinfectionsoccurredin10%and1%ofpatients,
respectively. Treatment-related serious TEAEs occurred in 58 patients
(24%), the most common being IDH-DS (8%), leukocytosis (4%),
tumor lysis syndrome (3%), nausea (2%), and hyperbilirubinemia
(2%).Enasidenib-relatedTEAEs led to dose modification,interruption,
or discontinuation for 7%, 22%, and 5% of patients, respectively.
Supplemental Table 4 shows treatment-related TEAEs by daily
enasidenib dose in the dose-escalation phase of this study.
IDH-DS occurred in 23 patients, 15 of whom had grade 3 to 4 IDH-
DS. Median time to onset was 48 days (range, 10-340 days). IDH-DS
was managed with systemic corticosteroids for 19 of 23 patients.
Enasidenib dosing was interrupted for 10 patients with IDH-DS, but
permanentdrugdiscontinuationwasnotrequired(supplementalTable5
further describes IDH-DS signs,symptoms,and management). Serious
IDH-DS was reported for 18 patients; episodes resolved without
sequelae for 16 of the 18 patients. A 62-year-old male died of
staphylococcal sepsis, contracted while recovering from grade 3 IDH-
DS, and an 83-year-old female developed pericardial effusion with
increasing white blood cell and peripheral blast counts, and she died as
a result of cardiac tamponade; retrospective review suggested death
may have been triggered by IDH-DS.
Enasidenib may be associated with rapid myeloid proliferation,
presenting as leukocytosis.24 Non–dose-dependent, non-infectious
leukocytosis events (any cause) were reported for 41 patients (17%),
primarily within the first 2 cycles. Leukocytosis was not necessarily
accompaniedbyIDH-DS.Treatment-relatedleukocytosiswasreported
for 15 patients (6%), leading to study discontinuation by 1 patient and
dose interruption for 6 patients. Grade 3 to 4 enasidenib-related leu-
kocytosis occurred within the first 2 treatment cycles for 5 of 6 patients,
4of whom showed hematologic evidence of myeloblastdifferentiation.
Enasidenib-inducedindirecthyperbilirubinemiaoccurredin35%of
patients. Bilirubin increases did not seem to signal intrinsic liver toxi-
city, because there were no clinically meaningful alanine aminotrans-
ferase or aspartate aminotransferase increases over time in any patient.
Increases may be the result of off-target inhibition of the UGT1A1
enzyme responsible for bilirubin metabolism (data on file; Agios Phar-
maceuticals, Inc.), an effect similar to that of congenital UGT1A1
deficiency (eg, Gilbert syndrome).
IDH-DS, leukocytosis,and hyperbilirubinemia generally decreased
in frequency asenasidenib treatment continued(supplemental Table 6).
Efficacy in relapsed/refractory AML
Response.
Thirty-four patients (19.3%) with relapsed/refractory
AML attained complete remission. The ORR for all relapsed/refractory
AML patients was 40.3% (95% CI, 33.0%-48.0%) (Table 3). Median
time to first response was 1.9 months (range, 0.5-9.4 months); 87.3% of
responding patients attained a first response by cycle 5. Of 34 patients
who achieved complete remission, 7 (20.6%) did so by cycle 3, 23
(67.6%) by cycle 5, and 28 (82.4%) by cycle 7. Figure 1 shows the
evolution of response at each treatment cycle among the 71 patients
with relapsed/refractory AML who responded on-study. The ORR
for patients treated with enasidenib 100 mg per day (n 5 109) was
38.5%. Seventeen patients (10%) discontinued enasidenib treat-
ment to proceed to stem cell transplant.
The ORR for patients with IDH2-R140 mutations was 35.4% (95%
CI, 27.2%-44.2%) and for thosewith IDH2-R172 mutations, ORR was
53.3% (95% CI, 37.9%-68.3%). Rates of complete remission were
17.7% (95% CI, 11.6%-25.4%) in patients with IDH2-R140 mutations
and 24.4% (95% CI, 12.9%-39.5%) for patients with IDH2-R172
mutations.The extent of 2-HG suppression from baseline at cycle 2 day
1 was not correlated with clinical response among all patients or within
either site-mutation subgroup. Clinical activity was observed at
all enasidenib doses (50-650 mg per day) (supplemental Table 7).

A treatment-related TEAE was defined as any event that began or worsened on or
after the start of enasidenib use until 28 days after the last dose and was considered by

 Bone marrow effects.
Bone marrow aspirates in clinical re-
sponders showed reduced myeloblasts and the morphologic appear-
ance of mature myeloid forms with a normal immunophenotype
(Figure 2A). Myeloid differentiation and trilineage hematopoietic
recoverywasobserved,typicallywithoutinterveningmarrowaplasiaor
hypoplasia. Hematologic changes for patients with relapsed/refractory
AML are shown in Figure 3. Mature granulocytes from patients in
remission (Figure 2B) retained the IDH2 mutation and cytogenetic
abnormalities,indicatingthatmaturingcellsevolvedfromtheabnormal
myeloblast population rather than from nonmalignant cells.
Survival.
At a median follow-up of 7.7 months (range, 0.4-26.7
months), median overall survival among patients with relapsed/
refractory AML was 9.3 months (95% CI, 8.2-10.9 months) and
estimated 1-year survival was 39%. Patients who attained complete or
partial remission had a median survival of 19.7 months (95% CI, 11.6
months to not reached) or 14.4 months (95% CI, 7.5-26.7 months),
respectively (Figure 4). For patients who had received 2 or more prior
AML regimens, median survival was 8.0 months (95% CI, 5.9-9.0
months).Median event-free survival duration was 6.4 months (95% CI,
5.4-7.5 months). Thirty- and 60-day mortality rates were 5.1% and
13.1%, respectively.
Discussion
AML is characterized by rapidproliferation of myeloidprogenitors that
failtoachievemultilineagedifferentiation.25Despitedecadesofclinical
investigation, the primary therapeutic approach is still intensive
cytotoxic induction and consolidation chemotherapy.23 Patients with
relapsed/refractory AML and those ineligible for intensive therapy
have few therapeutic options. Our study suggests that continuous
daily oral therapy with enasidenib can induce terminal differentiation
of leukemic myeloblasts and lead to normal trilineage hematopoi-
esis in responding patients with mutant-IDH2 relapsed/refractory
AML, most of whom had received multiple prior AML-directed
treatments.
Enasidenib was well tolerated by these primarily older patients with
mutant-IDH2 advanced myeloid malignancies. Although the pharma-
cokinetic profile, 2-HG reductions, and clinical efficacy support further
investigation of a 100 mg once-per-day enasidenib dose, the MTD was
not reached at doses of up to 650 mg per day. Because enasidenib is not
myeloablative, patients with mutant-IDH2 hematologic malignancies
may be spared the degree of hematologic toxicity associated with
intensive treatment. In this study, only 5% of patients discontinued
therapy as a result of a treatment-related TEAE. Enasidenib is not
associated with bone marrow aplasia and susceptibility to severe in-
fections seen with standard cytotoxic agents. Rates of enasidenib-
related grade 3 to 4 hematologic TEAEs (10%) and infections (1%)
were low compared with other AML treatments, for which rates can
range from 20% to 90%.26-29
IDH-DS was reported for 10% of patients, which is less fre-
quent than rates of differentiation syndrome reported for patients
with acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with all-trans retinoic
acid (;25%30).31,32 IDH-DS has also been reported in patients
receiving ivosidenib.33 Treatment of IDH-DS with intravenous
corticosteroids until improvement may be appropriate for all-trans
retinoic acid–related differentiation syndromes.30,33,34 Enasidenib
can induce rapid myeloid proliferation, typically with a range of
maturing cells in peripheral blood, resulting in rapid increases in
white blood cell count, often without co-occurring infection or
clinical signs of IDH-DS. Leukocytosis can be treated by initiating
hydroxyurea or increasing hydroxyurea dose.33
Overall, 40.3% of patients with relapsed/refractory AML had a
hematologic response during enasidenib treatment, including 34
patients with complete remissions and 11 with partial remissions.

From 
 The median duration of response (5.8 months) with enasidenib may be
clinically meaningful for this population, which included older patients
in second or later relapse. Ten percent of patients proceeded to
transplant, suggesting that enasidenib may provide a bridge to
potentially curative treatment. Hematologic responses were attained
regardless of IDH2 mutation site. Although suppression of 2-HG is
likely required for clinical response, nonresponders also showed
reductions in 2-HG. The lack of association between extent of 2-HG
suppression and response suggests that additional mechanisms may
contribute to the clinical activity of enasidenib that warrant further
investigation.
Unlike cytarabine-based regimens, failure to obtain an early re-
sponse with enasidenib did not presage treatment failure, as first
responses were reported several months after beginning enasidenib

From 
 treatment. Enasidenib, like hypomethylating agents, may produce a
response pattern different from that of cytotoxic treatments.35 As
with hypomethylating agent–based therapy, in the absence of disease
progression, it may be prudent for patients to receive multiple
enasidenib treatment cycles to induce or improve response. Notably,
cellular differentiation with mutant-IDH inhibitors can cause transient
increases in blast percentages that do not necessarily indicate
progressive disease.36 The prognostic impact of the persistent mutant
IDH2 clone remains unknown, but sustained enasidenib treatment
may be necessary to suppress future clonal proliferation.
Median overall survival with enasidenib is especially promising at
9.3 months among all patients with relapsed/refractory AML, and 8.0
months in patients who had received 2 or more previous anti-cancer
regimens. In a randomized phase 3 study in which patients with
relapsed/refractory AML were treated with 1 or more of 7 available
salvage treatments according to the investigator’s choice, median
overall survival was only 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.9-4.4 months).37
In conclusion, data from this study showed that single-agent
enasidenib was well tolerated, induced hematologic responses,and was
associated with a median survival of more than 9 months in patients
with relapsed or refractory mutant-IDH2 AML. A multicenter, ran-
domized phase 3 study (NCT02577406; An Efficacy and Safety Study
of AG-221 [CC-90007] Versus Conventional Care Regimens in Older
Subjects With Late Stage Acute Myeloid Leukemia Harboring an
Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2 Mutation [IDHENTIFY]) is ongoing.
