Abstract
Background: Clinical chemistry tests for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are currently unavailable. The aim of this
study was to explore the diagnostic utility of proteotoxic biomarkers in plasma and urine, plasma protein glycation,
oxidation, and nitration adducts, and related glycated, oxidized, and nitrated amino acids (free adducts), for the
clinical diagnosis of ASD.
Methods: Thirty-eight children with ASD (29 male, 9 female; age 7.6 ± 2.0 years) and 31 age-matched healthy
controls (23 males, 8 females; 8.6 ± 2.0 years) were recruited for this study. Plasma protein glycation, oxidation, and
nitration adducts and amino acid metabolome in plasma and urine were determined by stable isotopic dilution
analysis liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Machine learning methods were then employed to
explore and optimize combinations of analyte data for ASD diagnosis.
Results: We found that children with ASD had increased advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), Nε-carboxymethyl-
lysine (CML) and Nω-carboxymethylarginine (CMA), and increased oxidation damage marker, dityrosine (DT), in plasma
protein, with respect to healthy controls. We also found that children with ASD had increased CMA free adduct in plasma
ultrafiltrate and increased urinary excretion of oxidation free adducts, alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde and glutamic
semialdehyde. From study of renal handling of amino acids, we found that children with ASD had decreased renal
clearance of arginine and CMA with respect to healthy controls. Algorithms to discriminate between ASD and healthy
controls gave strong diagnostic performance with features: plasma protein AGEs—CML, CMA—and 3-deoxyglucosone-
derived hydroimidazolone, and oxidative damage marker, DT. The sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating
characteristic area-under-the-curve were 92%, 84%, and 0.94, respectively.

Conclusions: Changes in plasma AGEs were likely indicative of dysfunctional metabolism of dicarbonyl metabolite
precursors of AGEs, glyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone. DT is formed enzymatically by dual oxidase (DUOX); selective increase
of DT as an oxidative damage marker implicates increased DUOX activity in ASD possibly linked to impaired gut mucosal
immunity. Decreased renal clearance of arginine and CMA in ASD is indicative of increased arginine transporter activity
which may be a surrogate marker of disturbance of neuronal availability of amino acids. Data driven combination of these
biomarkers perturbed by proteotoxic stress, plasma protein AGEs and DT, gave diagnostic algorithms of high sensitivity
and specificity for ASD.

Background
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are defined as develop-
mental disorders mainly affecting social interactions and
range of interests and causing a wide spectrum of other
disabilities, such as speech disturbances, repetitive and/or
compulsive behaviors, hyperactivity, anxiety, and difficulty
to adapt to new environments, with or without cognitive
impairment [1]. The high heterogeneity of the clinical
presentation makes diagnosis of ASD difficult and uncer-
tain, particularly at the early stages of development. Dis-
covery
and
development
of
robust
biomarkers
for
diagnosis and progression of severity of ASD is expected
to facilitate earlier diagnosis and intervention. It will also
likely reveal new causative factors [2, 3]. In particular, al-
teration in the metabolome and specific damaging bio-
chemical modifications may reveal the presence of a
shared metabolic impairment in children with an other-
wise highly heterogeneous background, thus shedding
some light on the etiopathogenesis of ASD. Genetic causes
of ASD are evident in about 30–35% of cases. For the
remaining 65–70% of patients, it is generally agreed that
ASD results from the combination of environmental fac-
tors with multiple de novo mutations, copy number vari-
ation, and rare genetic variants, each possibly lending to
additive effects. Environmental factors may also be in-
volved and reflected in epigenetic modifications [4]. Tran-
scriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling have
been proposed for diagnosis of ASD, with diagnostic per-
formance judged by area under-the-curve of receiver oper-
ating characteristic (AUROC) plot of 0.73–0.91 [5–7]. It is
expected that improved diagnostic performance may be
achieved with a relatively small number of biomarker ana-
lytes linked to the pathogenic mechanism of ASD.
Impairment of protein homeostasis leading to proteotoxic
stress and activation of the unfolded protein response
(UPR) has been implicated in ASD [8]. Drivers of impaired
protein quality are increased spontaneous modifications by
glycation, oxidation, and nitration [9]. Glycation of proteins
occurs by spontaneous reaction of proteins with glucose,
reactive
dicarbonyl
metabolites,
glyoxal,
methylglyoxal
(MG), and 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), and other saccharides
and saccharide derivatives. Protein glycation adducts are
classified as early stage glycation adducts—such as Nε-fruc-
tosyl-lysine (FL) residues formed by glycation of proteins by
glucose—and late-stage adducts, advanced glycation end-
products (AGEs)—such as Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML)
and glucosepane (GSP) residues—formed by the degrad-
ation of FL residues, hydroimidazolones G-H1, MG-H1,
and 3DG-H formed by the modification of arginine resi-
dues by glyoxal, MG and 3-DG, respectively, Nω-carboxy-
methylarginine (CMA)—also formed by the reaction of
glyoxal with arginine residues, and methylglyoxal-derived
lysine crosslink (MOLD). Protein oxidation occurs by the
reaction of proteins with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
is increased in oxidative stress. Examples of protein oxida-
tion adducts are dityrosine (DT), N-formylkynurenine
(NFK), α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA), and glutamic
semialdehyde (GSA) residues. Oxidative stress has been im-
plicated as a contributory factor in the development of
ASD [10–12]. Increased oxidative damage associated with
oxidative stress and neuroinflammation may be common
features of ASD in children. Protein nitration occurs by the
reaction of proteins with reactive nitrogen species such as
peroxynitrite. The main adduct formed by protein nitration
is 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) residues (Fig. 1). Increased protein
damage by these mechanisms may lead to activation of the
UPR to counter the proteotoxic threat and related inflam-
matory response [13, 14].
Glycated, oxidized, and nitrated proteins undergo prote-
olysis to form related glycated, oxidized, and nitrated
amino acids—also called glycation, oxidation, and nitration
free adducts. Glycated, oxidized, and nitrated amino acids
are released into plasma and are excreted in urine. Urinary
excretion of glycation, oxidation, and nitration free adducts
are approximate measures of whole body fluxes of protein
glycation, oxidation, and nitration, respectively. There are
also minor contributions to the pool of these metabolites
by direct glycation, oxidation, and nitration of amino acids
and absorption from food after digestion of damaged pro-
teins therein [9]. Insight into renal handling of amino acids
by the kidney is gained by deducing the renal clearance
(CL) of amino acids from plasma to urine. For low

 molecular weight metabolites such as amino acids, CL is
mainly influenced by renal tubule reuptake of amino acids
mediated by amino acid membrane transporters. ASD has
been previously associated with homozygous mutations in
gene solute carrier family 7, member 5 (SLC7A5) which
encodes the large neutral amino acid transporter subunit-1
(hLAT-1); and in males, with rare holomorphic variants of
cationic amino acid transporter-3 (CAT-3) mediating up-
take of arginine, ornithine, and lysine. These transporters
mediate amino acid uptake into the cells, including neu-
rons [15].
In this study, we explore the association of proteotoxic
damage with ASD by quantifying levels of protein
glycation, oxidation, and nitration adducts in plasma
protein and related free adducts in plasma and urine of
children with ASD and healthy controls. We also quan-
tify the conventional plasma amino acid metabolome
[16] and CL of glycation, oxidation, and nitration free
adducts and unmodified amino acids. We then explore
the diagnostic potential of these biomarkers by develop-
ment of diagnostic algorithms with optimum combina-
tions of analyte features. We found evidence of increase
of selected plasma protein AGEs and DT in children
with ASD and also decreased CL of arginine and CMA.
These findings implicate a disturbance of metabolism of
dicarbonyl precursors of AGEs and activation of dual

 oxidase (DUOX) in ASD. The initial evidence given
herein suggests combination of plasma protein AGE and
DT levels may provide a blood-based test for diagnosis
of ASD. Decreased CL of arginine and CMA is proposed
to be linked to amino acid transporter dysfunction in
ASD, building on increasing evidence of neuronal amino
acid availability as a driver in ASD development.
Methods
Subject recruitment
A total of 69 children were recruited. Of these, 38 had a
diagnosis of ASD (29 males and 9 females) and 31 were
classified as typically developing (TD) children (23 males
and 8 females)—Fig. 2. The age of the two subject groups
was not significantly different. Subject age was as follows:
ASD group, 7.6 years ±2.0 years, range 5–12 years and TD
group, 8.6 ± 2.0 years, range 5–12 years. All ASD subjects
received a diagnosis of ASD by two child development ex-
perts at the Child Neurology and Psychiatry Unit of the
Bellaria Hospital of Bologna (IRCCS Institute of Neuro-
logical Sciences), according to the Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DSM 5 [1] criteria,
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) [10],
Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) [17] and charac-
teristics of onset pattern of ASD defined according to
Ozonoff et al. [18]. Developmental and cognitive levels
were assessed by Psychoeducational Profile-3 (PEP-3) [19]
and Leiter International Performance Scale–Revised (Lei-
ter-R) [20]. For both ASD and TD subjects, exclusion cri-
teria were presence of inflammatory or infective disease
and taking antioxidant supplements at the time of study.
No subject underwent any surgery intervention in the
4 months prior to blood and urine collection. None of the
ASD subjects had active epilepsy at the time of blood and
urine sampling. Subjects with ascertained medical and
neurological comorbidity were excluded, through a med-
ical work up including electroencephalography (recorded
during awake and sleep), cerebral magnetic resonance im-
aging, standard clinical and neurological examination,
neurometabolic, and genetic investigations (including
comparative genomic hybridization array, molecular assay
for Fragile X and MECP2). Subjects recruited for this
study were not taking any medication. TD children were
recruited in the local community, with no sign of cogni-
tive, learning, and psychiatric involvement. They were at-
tending mainstream school and had not been subjected to
stressful events. Dietary habits were assessed by a Food
Questionnaire, built according to the guidelines issued by
the Emilia-Romagna Health Authority. No ASD child was
on a diet free of gluten or casein. Both patients and con-
trols were on a typical Mediterranean diet, as defined by
the prevalence of both simple and complex carbohydrates,
use of olive oil, and plenty of fruit [21]. The consumption
of vegetables was less than desirable in both patients and
controls, although vegetable intake was more limited in
ASD patients. Demographic and clinical features of ASD
are summarized in Table 1. All subjects were recruited at
the Child Neurology and Psychiatry Unit of the Bellaria
Hospital of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.
Blood and urine sampling
Blood was withdrawn in the morning from fasting
children. Spot urine samples were the first ones in the
morning.
Blood
samples
were
collected
using
ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) as anticoagu-
lant. Plasma and blood cells were separated immediately
by centrifugation (2000g, 10 min) and plasma samples
stored at − 80 °C until analysis and transferred between
collaborating laboratories on dry ice.
Assay of markers of protein glycation, oxidation, and
nitration
The content of glycated, oxidized, and nitrated adduct res-
idues in plasma protein was quantified in exhaustive en-
zymatic digests by stable isotopic dilution analysis liquid
chromatography-tandem
mass
spectrometry
(LC-MS/
MS), with correction for autohydrolysis of hydrolytic en-
zymes [22]. The concentrations of related glycated, oxi-
dized, and nitrated amino acids related free adducts
(glycated, oxidized, and nitrated amino acids) in plasma
and urine were determined similarly in plasma and urine
ultrafiltrate, respectively. Ultrafiltrate of plasma (50 μL)
was collected by microspin ultrafiltration (10 kDa cut-off)
at 4 °C. Retained protein was diluted with water to 500 μL
and washed by 4 cycles of concentration to 50 μL and di-
lution to 500 μL with water over the microspin ultrafilter
at 4 °C. The final washed protein (100 μL) was delipidated
and hydrolysed enzymatically as described [22, 23]. Ultra-
filtrate of urine (50 μL) was collected by microspin ultrafil-
tration (3 kDa cut-off) at 4 °C.
Protein hydrolysate (25 μL, 32 μg equivalent) or ultra-
filtrate (5 μL) was mixed with stable isotopic standard
analytes (amounts as given previously [24]) and analyzed
by LC-MS/MS using an Acquity™ UPLC system with a
Xevo-TQS tandem mass spectrometer (Waters, Man-
chester, UK). Samples are maintained at 4 °C in the

Hypercarb™ (Thermo Scientific), in series with pro-
grammed switching, at 30 °C. Chromatographic reten-
tion was necessary to resolve oxidized analytes from
their amino acid precursors to avoid interference from
partial
oxidation
of
the
latter
in
the
electrospray
ionization source of the mass spectrometric detector.
Analytes
were
detected
by
electrospray
positive
ionization and mass spectrometry multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) mode where analyte detection re-
sponse was specific for mass/charge ratio of the analyte
molecular ion and major fragment ion generated by
collision-induced dissociation in the mass spectrometer
collision cell. The ionization source and desolvation gas
temperatures were 120 and 350 °C, respectively; cone
gas and desolvation gas flow rates were 99 and 900 L/h;
and the capillary voltage was 0.60 kV. Argon gas (5.0 ×
10−3 mbar) was in the collision cell. For MRM detection,
molecular ion and fragment ion masses and collision en-
ergies optimized to ± 0.1 Da and ± 1 eV, respectively,
were programmed [22]—Additional file 1: Table S1.
Analytes determined were glycation adducts—FL, and
AGEs, CML, Nε-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), pyrraline,
CMA, G-H1, MG-H1, 3DG-H, MOLD and GSP; oxida-
tion adducts—DT, NFK, AASA, GSA; nitration adduct,
3-NT; and all major amino acids. Oxidation, nitration,
and glycation adduct residues are normalized to their
amino acid residue precursors and given as millimoles/
mole amino acid modified, and related free adducts are
given in nanomolar. Chemical structures and biochem-
ical and clinical significance of these analytes have been
described elsewhere [9, 25]. Renal clearance (CL) of gly-
cation, oxidation, and nitration free adducts and un-
modified amino acids was deduced from plasma and
spot urine collections: CL (μL/mg creatinine or mL/mg
creatinine) = [analyte]Urine (nmol/mg creatinine)/[analy-
te]Plasma (pmol/mL or nmol/mL).
Machine learning analysis
The objective was to distinguish between children with
ASD and healthy controls. In all cases, the diagnostic al-
gorithms were trained on 50% of the cases and controls
(training subset) before being used to predict the disease
class for each sample in the remaining subjects (test set),
twofold cross-validation. The outcome was to assign, for
each test set sample, a set of probabilities corresponding
to each of the ASD/control groups—the group assign-
ment being that for which the probability is highest. Test
data were held separate from algorithm training; algo-
rithm settings were not adjusted once we began to
analyze the test set data—thereby guarding against over-
fitting and hence providing a rigorous estimate of pre-
dictive performance. Four algorithm types were tested
for performance: random forests, logistic regression, en-
semble classifier, and support vector machines (SVMs)
[26–28]. During the algorithm training, we used the
complete panel of protein glycation, oxidation, and ni-
tration adducts as features and developed algorithms for
each analyte type: plasma protein adduct residues,
plasma free adducts, and urinary free adducts. For the
latter two, unmodified amino acids were also included as
features. The aim during the training was to select the
set of features that accomplishes the highest perform-
ance. The machine learning experiments initially ex-
plored
using
all
metabolite
features.
Subsequent
selection of a subset of discriminant biomarker features
improved the algorithm performance. For the biomarker
selection, we used a sequential feature selection ap-
proach. The biomarker feature selection and classifier
selection were made on the basis of algorithm perform-
ance defined by classification accuracy, sensitivity, speci-
ficity, area under-the-curve of the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC), positive likelihood ratio,
negative likelihood ratio, positive predictive value, nega-
tive predictive value, and F-measure. For each perform-
ance metric, the mean and 95% CI was determined and
reported. The algorithm training and testing was re-
peated 10 times, without altering the algorithm parame-
ters,
with
50%
data
split,
to
test
for
algorithm’s
robustness against any bias towards data split. We devel-
oped our computer programs using Statistics and Ma-
chine Learning Toolbox of MATLAB® (MathWorks,
Inc., Natick, USA), with a linear kernel SVM and se-
quential minimal optimization (SMO).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SD for parametric distribu-
tions
and
median
(lower–upper
quartile)
for
non-
parametric distributions. The test for normality of data
distribution applied was the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.
Significance was evaluated by Student’s t test or by
Mann–Whitney
U
test
for
parametrically
or
non-
parametrically distributed data, respectively. Bonferroni
correction was made for analysis of multiple analytes
without preconceived hypothesis. Correlation analysis was
performed by Spearman’s rho method with continuous
variables. For clinical categorical variables with ≥ 6 cat-
egories, Spearman correlation was performed—assuming
approximation to a continuous variable [29]; for other cat-
egorical variables, significance of difference of biomarker
data distributions between categories was assessed by one-
way ANOVA for parametric data and Kruskal—Wallis H
test. Data were analyzed using SPSS, version 24.0.
For power analysis in the study design, we chose the
level of the irreversible oxidative damage marker DT in
plasma protein. In healthy human subjects, plasma pro-
tein DT was 0.0287 ± 0.0027 mmol/mol tyr (n = 29) in

 previous studies [30]. We designed our study to detect a
50% increase in plasma protein DT at the 0.01% signifi-
cance level, for which ≥ 18 case and control samples
were required. Post hoc analysis revealed an 88% in-
crease with P = 0.00017, after Bonferroni correction of
14, 15 or 20 as appropriate with 27 cases and 21 con-
trols, suggesting the study was adequately powered for
this key target analyte.
Results
Children with autistic spectrum disorder recruited for this
study
Thirty-eight children with ASD were recruited for this
study. The distribution of severity of ASD in this subject
group recruited was (number of cases) mild (6), moder-
ate (6), and severe (26). The distribution of cognitive/de-
velopmental impairment was (number of cases) normal/
borderline IQ (11), mild (3), moderate (12), and severe
(12). The distribution of onset pattern of ASD was
(number of cases) early (22), regressive (6), and mixed
(10). The ADOS score ranged from 13 to 22 and the
CARS total score from 31.5 to 48.5.
Plasma protein glycation, oxidation, and nitration
In plasma protein, protein content of AGEs—CML, MG-
H1 and CMA—were increased in children with ASD, with
respect to healthy controls, whereas plasma protein con-
tent of AGE, 3DG-H, was decreased in children with
ASD, with respect to healthy controls. Plasma protein
content of the oxidative damage adduct, DT, was in-
creased in children with ASD, with respect to healthy con-
trols. Only changes in CML, CMA, and DT remained
significant after Bonferroni correction for measurement of
multiple analytes (Table 2). In correlation analysis, highly
significant positive correlations (P < 0.01, Spearman) were
of CML with DT, G-H1 with MG-H1 and DT, MG-H1
with CMA, CMA with DT, and AASA with GSA—Addi-
tional file 1: Table S2. No correlation or association of gly-
cation, oxidation, and nitration adduct residues was found
with demographic and clinical features. There was no sig-
nificant difference of these variables between subject
groups of different genders with and without ASD.
Plasma glycated, oxidized, and nitrated amino acids and
amino acid metabolome
For glycated, oxidized, and nitrated amino acid concen-
tration in plasma, FL, G-H1, and NFK were decreased
whereas CMA, AASA, and GSA were increased in chil-
dren with ASD, with respect to healthy controls. Only
increase in CMA remained significant after Bonferroni
correction (Table 3). In correlation analysis, highly sig-
nificant positive correlations were of pyrraline with MG-
H1 and 3DG-H, FL with CML, G-H1 and MG-H1, CEL
with MG-H1 and CMA, MG-H1 with 3DG-H, and
CMA with AASA. There were highly significant negative
correlations of pyrraline with NFK, CMA with MOLD,
and MOLD with AASA—Additional file 1: Table S3.
For the conventional amino acid metabolome, there
were increases in arg, gln, glu, and thr and decrease
in trp in children with ASD, with respect to healthy
controls. None of these changes remained significant
after Bonferroni correction (Table 4). There were
many highly significant positive correlations between
plasma amino acid concentrations—Additional file 1:

There was no significant difference of these variables
between genders.
Urinary glycated, oxidized, and nitrated amino acids and
amino acid metabolome and renal clearance
For the urinary flux of glycated, oxidized, and nitrated
amino acids, children with ASD showed increased urin-
ary excretion of CML, G-H1, CMA, MOLD, pyrraline,
DT, NFK, AASA, and GSA. Only urinary excretions of
DT and GSA remained significant after Bonferroni cor-
rection (Table 3). For the urinary flux of unmodified
amino acids, children with ASD showed increased urin-
ary excretion of all amino acids except asp, cys, lys, phe,
and tyr. Only increases in urinary excretion of asn, pro,
ser, and val remained significant after Bonferroni correc-
tion (Table 4). There were several highly significant posi-
tive correlations between urinary excretions of glycation,
oxidation, and nitration adducts and amino acids—see
Additional file 1: Table S5 and Table S6.
Renal clearance of CMA, GSP, DT, arg, glu, leu, phe,
and thr were decreased and renal clearance of NFK and
trp were increased in children with ASD, with respect to
healthy controls. Only decreases in renal clearance of
arg and CMA remained significant after Bonferroni cor-
rection: CLarg decreased 32% and CLCMA decreased 50%
in children with ASD, compared to healthy control; P <
0.001 (Tables 5 and 6). No correlation or association of
these glycation, oxidation, and nitration free adduct and
amino acid variables was found with demographic and
clinical features. There was no significant difference of
these variables between genders.
Changes of glycation, oxidation, and nitration adducts
and amino acid metabolome in plasma and urine are sum-
marized in heat maps (Fig. 3a, b). Data distributions of
biomarker with significantly different change in the ASD
study group after Bonferroni correction are given in Fig. 4.
Development of diagnostic algorithms for ASD
To explore diagnostic utility of protein glycation, oxidation,
and nitration measurements for ASD, we analyzed plasma
and urinary amino acid analyte data by a machine learning
approach. SVMs was the best-performing method out of
the four algorithms that were investigated. Algorithm opti-
mized from twofold cross-validation were as below.
(i) Algorithm-1, developed from plasma protein
glycation, oxidation, and nitration adduct residue
analytes.
It has the following features: CML, 3DG-H, CMA,
and DT. Classification accuracy was 88%, sensitivity
92%, specificity 84%, and AUROC 0.94. A random
outcome is 0.50.
(ii)Algorithm-2, developed from plasma glycated,
oxidized, and nitrated amino acids and conventional
amino acid metabolome.
It has the following features: CML and CMA. Classifi-
cation accuracy was 75%, sensitivity 81%, and specificity
67% and AUROC 0.80.
(iii)Algorithm-3, developed from plasma protein
glycation, oxidation, and nitration adduct residues
and plasma glycated, oxidized, and nitrated amino
acids and conventional amino acid metabolome
combined.
It has the following features: plasma protein CML,
3DG-H, CMA and DT residues, and plasma G-H1 and
GSA free adducts. Classification accuracy was 89%, sen-
sitivity 90%, specificity 87%, and AUROC 0.95.
(iv)
Algorithm-4, developed from urinary glycated,
oxidized, and nitrated amino acids.
It has the following features: GSA and pyrraline free
adducts. Classification accuracy was 77%, sensitivity
77%, specificity 76%, and AUROC 0.79 (Fig. 5, Table 7,
and Additional file 1: Table S7).
The diagnostic algorithms were used to deduce the
probability of having ASD for each patient diagnosed with
ASD by clinical symptoms (Table 1). The association and

 correlation of these probabilities with clinical features was
explored. No significant association or correlation of these
probabilities with clinical features (age, ADOS, total
CARS, CARS hyperactivity and CARS body use scores,
autism severity, cognitive/developmental impairment, and
ASD onset pattern) was found.
Discussion
In this study, we identified changes in plasma protein
AGE and oxidation adducts, increased CML, CMA, and
DT and decreased 3DG-H in ASD. Combined in an algo-
rithm, these features provided diagnostic performance im-
proved over that previously achieved in transcriptomic,
proteomic, and metabolomic studies [5–7]—with AUROC
0.94 and classification efficiency 88%. This was slightly im-
proved by combination with plasma G-H1 and GSA free
adducts, with AUROC 0.95 and classification efficiency
89%. This novel biomarker approach focused to protein
damage or proteotoxic stress may lead to biochemical-
based diagnosis of ASD and suggests that protein AGE
and oxidation may be linked to ASD pathogenesis.
Change in AGE and oxidation adduct content of plasma
proteins relates to the rate of protein modification in the
plasma compartment and, to a lesser extent, to modifica-
tions of plasma proteins in interstitial fluid. The major
plasma protein albumin makes repeated cycles from
plasma to interstitial fluid and lymph before degradation
[31]. CML residues in plasma protein are mainly produced
by the oxidative degradation of FL with a usually minor
contribution from glycation by glyoxal. CML is also con-
sidered to be a marker of oxidative damage [32]. CMA is

 produced exclusively by the glycation of proteins by
glyoxal [9]. Increased formation of glyoxal, mainly sourced
from lipid peroxidation, in ASD may explain increases in
plasma protein CML and CMA (Fig. 6a). Markers of lipid
peroxidation, plasma and red blood cell malondialdehyde,
urinary 8-isoprostane-F2a, and hexanoyl-lysine adduct
were elevated in ASD [33–35].
DT residue content of plasma proteins was increased in
subjects with ASD whereas other oxidative damage
markers, NFK, AASA, and GSA, were not. DT residue
formation occurs by reaction of tyrosine residues in pro-
teins with ROS and DUOX [36]. The selective increase in
DT may suggest a role of increased DUOX activity in
subjects
with
ASD.
DUOX
expression
is
increased
through activating transcription factor 2 in inflammatory
signaling [37]. DUOX has an important role in gut muco-
sal immunity, host–microbe homeostasis, and signaling
for neutrophil recruitment into allergic airways [38, 39].
Gut microbiota may be influential in the development of
the behavioral phenotype in ASD children [40] (Fig. 6a).
Decrease of 3DG-H content of plasma protein in subjects
with ASD likely reflects decreased concentration of plasma
3-DG. 3-DG is formed by degradation of fructosamine-3-
phosphate in the repair of early glycated proteins and deg-
radation of fructose-3-phosphate formed by fructosamine-
3-phosphokinase [41, 42] and the slow, non-enzymatic

 oxidative degradation of glucose and proteins glycated by
glucose [43]. It is metabolized to 3-deoxyfructose by aldo-
keto reductases 1A4, 1B1, and 1B3 which together consti-
tute 3-DG reductase activity [44]. Since FL residue content
of subjects with ASD was unchanged, with respect to
healthy controls, there is unlikely to be decreased activity of
fructosamine-3-phosphokinase in ASD. Rather, increased
3-DG reductase activity may explain decrease in plasma
protein 3DG-H residue content in ASD (Fig. 6a).
Combination of markers of oxidative metabolism,
DNA oxidation, and methylation in multivariate statis-
tical models was recently found to distinguish between
children with ASD and healthy controls [12]. Herein,
oxidative damage markers, plasma protein CML and DT
and plasma GSA free adduct, emerged as features of
diagnostic algorithms for ASD. Measurement of multiple
chemically defined markers of protein oxidative damage

 without ASD has provided evidence of changes specific
to oxidative damage marker type and sample compart-
ment that likely contributed to algorithm development
for ASD with improved diagnostic performance.
For unmodified amino acids, we found no changes
after correction for multiple measurements in plasma
but there were significant increases in urinary excretion
of asn, pro, ser, and val. This may relate to impaired tis-
sue uptake and retention of these amino acids in ASD.
For
modified
amino
acids,
only
increased
CMA
remained significantly increased in plasma for children
with ASD. This may relate to proteolysis of plasma pro-
teins and potentially other proteins of increased CMA
residue content in ASD. For modified amino acids in
urine, urinary excretions of oxidative damage markers,
DT and GSA free adducts, were increased in children
with ASD after correction for multiple analytes. This
may relate to proteolysis of plasma proteins and other
proteins with increased oxidative damage and DUOX-
catalyzed modification in ASD. The amino acid metabo-
lome in plasma and urine has been explored previously
for biomarkers of ASD [7, 45–47]. We confirmed the re-
ported minor increase in plasma arg in ASD, compared
to healthy controls, but significance was lost after cor-
rection for multiple measurements [48].
Pyrraline is an AGE sourced only from food [49]. In-
creased urinary pyrraline is indicative of increased food
consumption and/or permeability of the gastrointestinal
tract to pyrraline. The positive correlation of pyrraline
with CML, MG-H1, CMA, DT, and GSA free adducts in
urine suggests that increase of these free adducts may be
partly due to food consumption.
Exploring changes in renal CL of amino acids provides
insight in functional activity of amino acid transporters in
the renal tubular epithelium. The deduction of CL herein
was an indirect measure based on estimates of urinary an-
alyte/creatinine ratio rather than urinary analyte excretion
rate determined in urine collection made over a fixed time
interval, usually 24 h. This was done because of difficulties
in timed collection of urine in children [50]. Decreased
CL relates to increased tubular reuptake and increased
amino acid transporter activity. Decreased CL of arg and
CMA likely reflects increased reuptake of arg and CMA.
Arg uptake by the tubular epithelium is mediated by neu-
tral and basic amino acid transport protein rBAT and sol-
ute carrier 7, member 9 (b0,+AT) [apical uptake] and
CD98 heavy subunit (CD98hs)/y+LAT-2 (solute carrier
family 7 member 6) and CD98hs/y+LAT-1 (solute carrier
family 7 member 7) complexes [basolateral transport] [51]
and this likely mediates renal tubule uptake of arginine de-
rivative CMA too (Fig. 6b). Homozygous mutations of
SLC7A5 gene were associated with ASD. SLC7A5 encodes
protein hLAT-1 which, together with CD98hs, form the
large neutral amino acid transporter involved in maintain-
ing normal levels of brain branched chain amino acids in
the brain [52]. Dysfunction of hLAT-1, also found in the
renal tubular epithelium in complex with CD98hs [51],
may leave the latter more available for complexation with
y+LAT-1 and y+LAT-2 and drive increased reuptake and
decreased CL of arginine and CMA. In addition, rare
holomorphic variants in males of amino acid transporter
CAT-3 were associated with ASD [15]. Disturbance in ar-
ginine transporter function may be a common feature of
ASD and measure of CL of arginine is an accessible bio-
marker of this.
Combination of AGE and DT residue content of plasma
protein in Algorithm-1 and this combined with G-H1 and
GSA free adducts in Algorithm-3 gave the best diagnostic
performance for detection of ASD from the analytes de-
termined herein. The absence of conventional, unmodified
amino acids from optimum features of the diagnostic al-
gorithms suggests that assay of trace level, AGE and oxi-
dised amino acid residues of plasma protein and free
adducts in plasma provides a diagnostic advantage which
has not been hitherto explored. It also suggests that AGE
and oxidation proteotoxic stress may underly the develop-
ment of ASD, at least in part. Protein glycation and oxida-
tion adducts from dietary protein contribute to levels of

 plasma and urinary glycation and oxidation free adducts;
whereas glycation and oxidation adduct residues of pro-
tein reflect rates of endogenous glycation and oxidation of
protein in mainly the vascular compartment. The domin-
ance of plasma protein AGE and oxidation adducts in
Algorithm-1 and the modest improvement by addition of
plasma G-H1 and GSA free adducts (Algorithm-3) may
indicate that there is limited influence of dietary glycated
and oxidized proteins to the development of ASD. Rather,
challenge to proteostasis by changes in endogenous pro-
tein modification by AGEs and DT may contribute to the
development of ASD.
Conclusions
We identified changes in plasma protein glycation and
oxidation markers; increased CML, CMA, and DT and de-
creased 3DG-H that combined in an algorithm gave im-
proved diagnostic performance over other approaches.
Increased levels of DT may indicate induction of increased
DUOX activity linked to gut mucosa dysfunction. Disturb-
ance of renal handling of arginine and CMA may indicate
dysfunctional arginine transporter function common in
ASD. Further clinical validation of plasma protein CML,
CMA, DT, and 3DG-H may provide improved diagnosis
of ASD. For future studies, we suggest firstly validation of
the current findings in an independent clinical study
group. Thereafter, priorities are investigation of the bio-
markers in children younger than 5 years old to assess
their ability to improve diagnosis at earlier stages of ASD
development, assessment of the biomarkers in prospective
studies for prediction of risk of progression to severe
symptoms, study of the association of genetic polymor-
phisms of DUOX and arginine transporters with clinical
ASD, preclinical functional genomics of DUOX and argin-
ine transporters with an ASD-like phenotype, and assess-
ment of the specificity of the algorithms for ASD versus
other psychiatric conditions.
