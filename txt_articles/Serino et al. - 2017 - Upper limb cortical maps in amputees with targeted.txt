Neuroprosthetics research in amputee patients aims at developing new prostheses that move and feel like real limbs. Targeted
muscle and sensory reinnervation (TMSR) is such an approach and consists of rerouting motor and sensory nerves from the
residual limb towards intact muscles and skin regions. Movement of the myoelectric prosthesis is enabled via decoded electro-
myography activity from reinnervated muscles and touch sensation on the missing limb is enabled by stimulation of the reinner-
vated skin areas. Here we ask whether and how motor control and redirected somatosensory stimulation provided via TMSR
affected the maps of the upper limb in primary motor (M1) and primary somatosensory (S1) cortex, as well as their functional
connections. To this aim, we tested three TMSR patients and investigated the extent, strength, and topographical organization of
the missing limb and several control body regions in M1 and S1 at ultra high-field (7 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Additionally, we analysed the functional connectivity between M1 and S1 and of both these regions with fronto-parietal regions,
known to be important for multisensory upper limb processing. These data were compared with those of control amputee patients
(n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 12). We found that M1 maps of the amputated limb in TMSR patients were similar in terms of
extent, strength, and topography to healthy controls and different from non-TMSR patients. S1 maps of TMSR patients were also
more similar to normal conditions in terms of topographical organization and extent, as compared to non-targeted muscle and
sensory reinnervation patients, but weaker in activation strength compared to healthy controls. Functional connectivity in TMSR
patients between upper limb maps in M1 and S1 was comparable with healthy controls, while being reduced in non-TMSR
patients. However, connectivity was reduced between S1 and fronto-parietal regions, in both the TMSR and non-TMSR patients
with respect to healthy controls. This was associated with the absence of a well-established multisensory effect (visual enhancement
of touch) in TMSR patients. Collectively, these results show how M1 and S1 process signals related to movement and touch are
enabled by targeted muscle and sensory reinnervation. Moreover, they suggest that TMSR may counteract maladaptive cortical
plasticity typically found after limb loss, in M1, partially in S1, and in their mutual connectivity. The lack of multisensory
interaction in the present data suggests that further engineering advances are necessary (e.g. the integration of somatosensory
feedback into current prostheses) to enable prostheses that move and feel as real limbs.

Introduction
The loss of an upper limb results in functional reorganiza-
tion of primate primary motor (M1) and somatosensory
(S1) areas as originally demonstrated in non-human pri-
mates (Kaas et al., 1983; Merzenich et al., 1983; Kaas,
1991; Pons, 1991). In humans, such reorganization after
limb amputation has also been observed and considered a
form of maladaptive plasticity, linked to the phantom limb
syndrome and associated chronic pain (Flor et al., 1995;
Lotze et al., 2001; Foell et al., 2014; but see Makin et al.,
2013b). Subsequently, it has been proposed that motor ac-
tivity and usage of the missing limb, as well as related
sensory feedback, may in principle counteract maladaptive
reorganization of sensory-motor cortices in amputees, thus
inspiring several rehabilitation techniques, based on motor
imagery and mirror box therapy (Chan et al., 2007;
Rothgangel et al., 2011). These approaches, however, re-
quire long sessions of training and are unrelated to true
ecological limb usage. Thus, optimal sensory-motor train-
ing should consist of naturalistic control of a prosthetic
limb.
The field of neuroprosthetics pursues various approaches
for the development of bidirectional interfaces allowing
amputees to feel and control a prosthetic limb in the most
intuitive and natural fashion. A key example of these tech-
niques is the so-called targeted muscle and sensory reinnerva-
tion (TMSR) (Kuiken, et al., 2004, 2007b). It consists of de-
innervating spare muscle groups in the residual limb or the
chest of the amputee (i.e. target muscles) and reinnervating
them with the residual arm nerves of the amputated limb. In
this way, motor commands generated to control the arm or
hand are decoded from electromyographical signals of the
target
muscles
and
used
to control
a
prosthetic
limb
(Kuiken, et al., 2004, 2007b). In some patients the approach
may also include targeted sensory reinnervation, for which
de-innervated skin regions near or over the target muscle are
reinnervated with afferent fibres of the residual somatosen-
sory nerves of the amputated limb (Kuiken et al., 2007a;
Hebert et al., 2014). As a consequence, stimuli applied to
the reinnervated skin regions evoke somatosensory sensations
as if the missing limb were stimulated. Thus, amputees may
use such TSMR systems to control their prosthetic limb by
recruiting central motor representations of the missing limb
and may perceive sensory feedback as arising from the miss-
ing limb, likely activating central somatosensory representa-
tions. However, while there exists evidence of motor and
sensory cortical plasticity in patients who underwent the
TMSR procedure (Chen et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2015), it
is not clearly demonstrated to what extent TMSR-based
prostheses recruit and reinstate cortical representations of
the missing limb. A way to answer this question would be
testing whether and how the TMSR procedure affects cortical
body representations in primary motor and somatosensory
cortices, potentially impacting current trends to improve
motor control and tactile perception as well as phantom
limb pain due to maladaptive plasticity (Flor et al., 1995;
Lotze et al., 2001).
In the present study, we first investigated whether move-
ment and somatosensory feedback linked to TMSR pros-
thesis is associated with more normal somatotopic maps in
M1 and S1 in TMSR patients, predicting that, compared to
amputee patients without TMSR (non-TMSR), M1 and S1
organization would be more similar to the normal organ-
ization in healthy participants. To this aim, we used ultra
high-field functional MRI (7 T) paradigms to map upper
limb representations (and neighbouring regions) in M1
and S1 in TMSR patients as described previously in healthy
subjects (Martuzzi et al., 2014, 2015; Siero et al., 2014;
Ejaz et al., 2015; Akselrod et al., 2017). In particular, we
examined M1 activity induced by movements of different
parts of the upper limb (Porro et al., 1996; Lotze et al.,
2000;
Alkadhi
et
al.,
2002;
Zeharia
et
al.,
2012).
Moreover, by applying touch cues to reinnervated skin re-
gions resulting in clear tactile percepts on the missing limb,
we also mapped the somatosensory representation of the
upper limb in S1, at the level of single fingers (Sanchez-
Panchuelo et al., 2010; Stringer et al., 2011; Martuzzi
et al., 2014, 2015; Akselrod et al., 2017). Specifically, we
studied the extent, strength, location, and topographical
sequence of upper limb representations in M1 and S1
using 7 T functional MRI in TMSR patients.
In addition, it is well known that perception of body parts
does not rely only on unimodal representations in M1 and

 S1, but also on multimodal body representations, especially
in multisensory-motor frontoparietal areas, as well as on dis-
tributed processing between unimodal and multimodal brain
regions (Serino and Haggard, 2010; Blanke et al., 2015).
In fact, key rehabilitative approaches for phantom limb syn-
drome, such as the mirror box treatment, are based on inte-
gration of multimodal visual, somatosensory, and motor cues
(Chan et al., 2007; Ramachandran and Altschuler, 2009).
Therefore, we also applied resting state functional connectiv-
ity analysis (Fox and Raichle, 2007) to study the functional
organization between maps of the different body parts
(including the amputated limb) in M1 and S1, and to inves-
tigate how these representations are integrated into sensory-
motor networks processing bodily information (Graziano and
Cooke, 2006; Dijkerman and de Haan, 2007; Berlucchi and
Aglioti, 2010). This analysis was complemented by a psycho-
physical investigation of the visual enhancement of touch
(VET) effect in TMSR patients, testing how vision of the
missing limb affects somatosensory perception of the targeted
skin region. The presence of VET in TMSR patients would
demonstrate existing interactions between visual and somato-
sensory representations of the missing limb, pointing to
normal multisensory representations. Three patients, who
received TMSR to control a prosthetic arm, were studied
and their functional MRI and behavioural results were com-
pared with those from six non-TMSR control amputees, suf-
fering from comparable upper limb amputation (without any
TMSR), and with 12 healthy control subjects.
Materials and methods
Participants
Three TMSR patients, who have been extensively tested pre-
viously (Kuiken et al., 2004, 2007b; Marasco et al., 2009),
were enrolled in the present study. Patient TMSR-01 was a
45-year-old female, who suffered left trans-humeral amputa-
tion due to a car accident. Fifteen months after injury and 7
years before the current investigation, her residual median and
distal radial nerves were transferred to the medial biceps and
lateral triceps muscles, respectively. Her intercostobrachial
nerve was cut to facilitate sensory reinnervation of her arm.
Patient TMSR-02 was a 33-year-old female, who suffered left
shoulder disarticulation following a motor vehicle collision.
Fifteen months after amputation and 8 years before the current
investigation, the median, ulnar and radial nerves on the left
side were transferred to different segments of her ipsilateral
pectoralis major and serratus anterior muscles. In addition,
the supraclavicular cutaneous and the intercostobrachial cuta-
neous nerves were cut and their distal portions were co-apted
to the ulnar and median nerves, respectively. Patient TMSR-03
was a 66-year-old male, who lost both his arms at the shoul-
ders due to electrical burns. Nine months after injury and 16
years before the current testing, his remaining left median,
ulnar, radial, and musculocutaneous nerves were transferred
to different segments of his left pectoralis major and minor
muscles. For all patients, more detailed clinical information
regarding surgical procedures and outcomes is reported in
previous papers (Kuiken et al., 2004, 2007a, b; Hijjawi
et al., 2006; O’Shaughnessy et al., 2008; Dumanian et al.,
2009).
Six upper limb amputated patients who did not receive
TMSR surgery (non-TMSR amputees) and whose site of am-
putation globally matched the amputation site of the three
TMSR patients were recruited [mean age = 45 years, standard
deviation (SD) = �14.5 years, six males] (see Supplementary
material for details). All patients underwent a semi-structured
interview, via a revised version of ‘The Changes in Body
Sensation Following Limb Loss’ questionnaire (CUBS-ques-
tionnaire) (adapted from Giummarra and Moseley, 2011; see
Supplementary material). Additional information extracted
from the interview regarding the phenomenology of phantom
limbs is presented in Table 1. Time since amputation and in-
tensity of phantom pain did not differ between TMSR and
non-TMSR
patients
(Wilcoxon
rank-sum
tests:
W = 19.0,
P = 0.36 and W = 13.5, P = 0.71, respectively). A group of
12
healthy
controls
performed
functional
MRI
scanning
(mean age = 29.75 years, SD = �12.0 years, three females)
and another group of 18 healthy participants took part as a
control group in the experiment on VET (mean age = 22 years,
SD = �2.3 years, five males).
All participants were originally right-handed, as confirmed
by the Edinburgh Oldfield Handedness Inventory (Oldfield,
1971). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
the University of Lausanne (Reference number: 113/2013) and
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All
participants provided written informed consent to participate
to the study.
Assessment of somatosensory
sensation from the missing limb
All amputee patients were interviewed (semi-structured interview;
adapted from Giummarra and Moseley, 2011) (Supplementary
material) about residual sensations, phantom limb experiences
and pain. All TMSR patients reported a clear sensation of the
presence of a phantom limb, in a natural and comfortable pos-
ture. At the time of testing none of the patients reported phan-
tom pain, except Patient TMSR-03. All TMSR patients claimed
to be able to move their phantom limbs. All patients reported
well-defined tactile sensation following tactile stimulation of
different skin regions from the reinnervated residual limb
(Supplementary material).
To quantify these referred sensations to the amputated limb
and to precisely localize the regions over the reinnervated skin
inducing reliable tactile percepts on different parts of the miss-
ing limb, we conducted a detailed psychophysical assessments
on the first day of testing, and a second shorter assessment at
the beginning of later sessions to confirm the reliability of
stimulation (for details about mapping of referred sensations
on the reinnervated skin see Supplementary material). Results
are reported in Fig. 1, showing that all TMSR participants
perceived
reliable
sensations
from
the
amputated
limb,
mostly localized on the palm, thumb, index, middle and little
fingers. A similar mapping procedure was used with non-
TMSR patients to identify possible areas of tactile sensations
referred to the amputated limb from stimulation of the skin
over the residual limb. These examinations were used to select

 the skin regions that were used for S1 mapping using 7 T
functional MRI and the VET experiment in TMSR patients.
Functional MRI data acquisition
Images were acquired on a short-bore head-only 7 T scanner
(Siemens Medical) with a 32-channel Tx/Rx rf-coil (Nova
Medical) (Salomon et al., 2014). Functional images were
acquired using a sinusoidal readout EPI sequence (Speck
et al., 2008) and comprised 28 axial slices. Slices were
placed over the postcentral gyrus (approximately orthogonal
to the central sulcus) to cover the primary somatosensory and
motor cortices (in-plane resolution 1.3 � 1.3 mm2; slice thick-
ness

on different days, to map motor and somatosensory represen-
tations, respectively. A 5-min resting state acquisition was also
performed and participants were asked to lay relaxed and still
with the eyes closed and to retain from any goal-oriented
thinking.
Motor representations were mapped using a block design
[participants performed in each run three types of movements
of one out of six body parts (see below) for 20 times, one
movement per second, followed by 10 s of rest]. One run per
body side (i.e. left and right) was performed and each block
was repeated eight times. Movements were selected based on
prosthesis movements (Zhou et al., 2007) and included: hand
closure and opening, wrist pronation/supination and elbow

 extension/flexion for left and right hands. Blocks of tongue,
chest and finger movements on both sides were also included.
All participants were trained on the movements before entering
the functional MRI scanner and successfully executed the re-
quested movements on the healthy and amputated side.
Somatosensory representations were mapped by adapting the
procedure described by Martuzzi et al. (2014, 2015): each
mapped body regions was manually stroked by the experi-
menter positioned at the entrance of the bore, with a Q-tip
probe (mounted on a stick if necessary). Each area was stroked
for 20 s, followed by 10 s of rest (no stroking); the stroking
sequence was repeated four times, keeping the order of the
stroked body parts fixed. Participants were instructed to pay
attention to the body region being stroked. For TMSR and
non-TMSR patients, tactile stimulations were delivered on
skin regions inducing well-defined referred sensations of the
missing
limb
(Supplementary
materials).
Additionally,
we
mapped the lips and the big toe bilaterally, to identify the
full extent of the somatotopic homunculus in S1. The stimu-
lation protocol used in amputees was adapted in healthy con-
trols to map the comparable body parts in non-amputated
individuals. Mapped body parts included: right and left fin-
gers, palm, arm, chest, lips and big toe (Supplementary
material).
Functional MRI data analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPM8 (Wellcome
Department
of
Cognitive
Neurology,
London,
UK),
Brainvoyager QX 2.4 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The
Netherlands),
and custom routines
running in MATLAB
(Mathworks, Boston). Functional volumes were spatially re-
aligned to the first volume. For M1 mapping in which soma-
totopy is more variable (Beisteiner et al., 2001; Alkadhi et al.,
2002), no smoothing was applied to M1 images in order to re-
tain the highest level of spatial specificity. For S1 mapping,
images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel
(full-width at half-maximum = 2 mm) following the procedure
presented in Martuzzi et al. (2014).
For M1 and S1 mapping, separate statistical analyses were
performed using a general linear model (GLM), where each
different movement/tactile stimulation was modelled as a
boxcar regressor and convolved with the canonical haemo-
dynamic response function (HRF) as basis function and six
motion parameters were added as nuisance regressors.
Motor mapping of the hand, wrist, elbow, chest, fingers and
tongue movements were calculated for each body side by con-
trasting each movement to rest epochs (e.g. Hand 4 Rest).
Regions of interest for each body part were collected using
False Detection Rate q 5 0.05 (FDR, Genovese et al., 2002)
to correct for multiple comparisons. However, in one partici-
pant (Patient non-TMSR-01) we had to use a threshold of
P 5 0.00001 uncorrected because no voxels were activated
otherwise (for movements of the elbow on the amputated side).
S1 mapping was performed by computing an F-contrast
(P 5 0.001 uncorrected) including HRF regressors of all the
body regions stimulated during the same run, to identify all
voxels responding to the stimulation of at least one body
region. The result was used as an S1 mask. Maps of single
region responses were computed by means of a t-contrast
(P 5 0.001 uncorrected). Within the S1 mask, each voxel
was
independently
labelled
as
representing
the
region
demonstrating the highest t-value for that particular voxel
leading to a ‘winner takes all’ competition between the stimu-
lated body regions. This procedure was applied independently
for the regions of the reinnervated skin for TMSR patients and
of the residual limb for non-TMSR patients, for the chest and
arm on the intact limb (bilaterally for controls), for the palm
and fingers on the intact limb (bilaterally for controls), for
right and left big toes, and for right and left lips.
Using resting state data, the functional connections (when
available) between left M1 – left S1 and between right M1 –
right S1 were investigated in all TMSR patients, non-TMSR
patients and healthy control subjects. In addition, we investi-
gated how each of these regions was functionally connected
with the so-called ‘sensorimotor’ network (SMN) (Biswal
et al., 1995; Lowe et al., 1998; Xiong et al., 1999; Cordes
et al., 2000, 2001; Beckmann et al., 2005; De Luca et al.,
2005; Fox et al., 2006). Further details about this analysis
are provided in the Supplementary material. The statistical ana-
lyses performed on M1 mapping, S1 mapping and functional
connectivity data are described below.
Visual enhancement of touch
VET was studied by comparing two-point discrimination
thresholds (2PDT; Weinstein, 1968) when subjects saw either
the stimulated body part (without viewing the actual tactile
stimuli) or another body part (Serino et al., 2009; Serino
and Haggard, 2010) (Supplementary material). TMSR pa-
tients, comfortably lying down on a bed in a prone position,
were presented with tactile stimulation delivered by four mech-
anical solenoids (M and E Solve), on the target area (non-
TMSR or TMSR region), in different experimental blocks. In
each trial, subjects were lightly tapped either by a single stimu-
lus (single tap) or by two simultaneous spatially separated
stimuli (double tap). Patients were requested to discriminate
between single and double taps, by verbally responding ‘one’
(32 trials) or ‘two’ (45 trials). Patients performed the tactile
task in two visual conditions, while viewing their hand (‘View
Hand’) or the chest/arm (‘View Chest’/‘View Arm’), filmed
through a video camera. In the ‘View Hand’ condition patients
saw their intact hand, flipped so as to resemble the amputated
one (a video of a man’s hand was used for Patient TMSR-03).
A control group of healthy participants performed the task
with the same procedure as for TMSR patients. They performed
the tactile task either on the chest (‘Touch Chest’) or the hand
(‘Touch Hand’), while viewing their chest (‘View Chest’) or
their Hand (‘View Hand’).
Signal detection measures were used to quantify tactile per-
formance. Double taps were defined as the to-be-detected
signal. D prime (d0) was calculated as a measure of perceptual
sensitivity (Green and Swets, 1966; Krantz, 1969). For each
condition, we calculated the rate of Hits, Misses, False Alarms
and Correct Rejections. Hit rates correspond to the number of
times participants correctly reported double taps. Misses cor-
respond to the number of times participants reported feeling
one tap when two taps were presented. False Alarms corres-
pond to the number of times participants reported two taps
when only one was presented. Correct Rejection corresponds
to the number of times participants correctly reported feeling
one tap. D prime (d0) is calculated as the difference between
the z-transformations of hit and false alarm rates (Serino et al.,
2007). We first verified whether the VET effect could be

 reproduced in healthy participants. D0 scores of healthy par-
ticipants were analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA
with Stimulation type (‘Touch Hand’, ‘Touch Chest’) and
Congruency of visual feedback (‘Congruent’, ‘Incongruent’)
as within-subject factors. VET data were further analysed to
statistically compare TMSR patients with healthy controls as
described below. We note that the VET experiment could not
be conducted in non-TMSR patients because in most cases, the
skin area inducing referred sensations was smaller than the
2PDT threshold.
Statistical analyses
For M1 mapping, S1 mapping and functional connectivity data,
we first defined an index as the difference between the dependent
variables for the body part of interest (TMSR regions) and the
corresponding control part (intact region). For VET, we defined
an index of the VET effect for the TMSR region and the non-
TMSR control region as the difference in d0 scores when viewing
the body part stimulated or when viewing the other body part.
To statistically compare the neuroimaging and behavioural indi-
ces between TMSR, non-TMSR and healthy controls, data from
single TMSR patients were compared to the non-TMSR and
healthy control groups using Crawford tests (Crawford and
Garthwaite, 2002). The Crawford test allows one to statistically
evaluate the score of a single patient against a modest normative
sample and makes use of non-central t-distributions. This test is
typically used in case studies, as it is more conservative than
standard single-sample t-test; it is thus well suited to compare
TMSR patients with the two control groups in the present study.
In addition, we made group-level comparisons by computing
non-parametric rank-sum Wilcoxon tests (Mann and Whitney,
1947) between TMSR and healthy controls and, between TMSR
and non-TMSR controls, as well as between non-TMSR and
healthy controls.
Results
M1 mapping
All three TMSR patients showed a normal somatotopic
location and order of body part activations in contralateral
M1 for different movements of the amputated hand, which
were similar to regions activated by the movements made
by their intact hand. The same movement-related activa-
tions
in
non-TMSR
amputees
were
reduced
or
even
absent. Moreover, in the two unilateral TMSR patients,
activation in the M1 hand area contralateral to the ampu-
tated hand was stronger than that induced by movements
of the healthy hand; this was not found for any of the non-
TMSR patients. In the bilateral TMSR patient, consistent
with these findings, activation in the M1 hand area contra-
lateral to the reinnervated side was higher than that
induced by movements of the non-reinnervated side. The
regions of M1 associated with specific movements of the
hand and upper limb in TMSR, non-TMSR amputees, and
healthy controls are shown in Fig. 2A.
To quantify M1 activations between TMSR patients, non-
TMSR patients, and healthy control subjects we analysed
three main parameters: (i) the extent of the activation for
each mapped movement was given by the number of active
voxels; (ii) the strength of each activation was quantified by
determining the peak activity (max t-value); and (iii) the
topographical order of these activations was described by
calculating the distance between the centres of mass of
activation clusters for different movements.
Extent
We first extracted the number of voxels active during
movements of the amputated and healthy hand in the
contralateral M1 regions as a measure of the extent of
the hand representation. For each patient, we then calcu-
lated an index of activation extent, as the difference
between the number of active voxels in the right (contra-
lateral to amputation) and the left hemisphere. The index
of activation extent was positive in the two unilateral
TMSR amputees, indicating more widespread activation
in the contralateral M1 during movements of the ampu-
tated limb, as compared to the intact limb. The index
was positive also in Patient TMSR-03, meaning in this
case, that more voxels were activated when he moved his
reinnervated amputated hand as compared to the non-rein-
nervated amputated hand. For each TMSR patient, the
index of activation extent was equivalent to that recorded
in healthy controls (Fig. 2B) (t = 1.37, P = 0.1; t = 1.01,
P = 0.17; and t = 0.81, P = 0.22 for Patients TMSR-01,
TMSR-02, and TMSR-03, respectively, as compared to
healthy controls using the Crawford test). In contrast, for
each TMSR patient this index was larger than for the non-
TMSR amputees (Fig. 2B; t = 2.32, P = 0.03; t = 2.16,
P = 0.04; and t = 2.07, P = 0.04, for Patients TMSR-01,
TMSR-02, and TMSR-03, respectively, as compared to
non-TMSR controls using the Crawford test). This analysis
therefore suggests that the extent of activations during
hand movements in the M1 contralateral to amputation
is more similar to normal conditions in TMSR patients as
compared to non-TMSR patients. This observation at the
single patient level was corroborated at the group level, as
non-parametric Wilcoxon comparisons showed that the
index of activation extent was not significantly different
between TMSR patients and healthy controls (W = 35.0,
P = 0.14), whereas it was significantly more positive in
TMSR
patients
compared
to
non-TMSR
controls
(W = 24.0, P = 0.02). In addition, the index of activation
extent was more negative in non-TMSR controls compared
to healthy controls (W = 21.0, P 5 0.001). This shows that
in non-reinnervated patients, contralateral M1 activity is
significantly weaker when performing movements with the
amputated arm compared to the healthy arm. The distribu-
tion of individual data for all participants for M1 extent
indices is shown in Fig. 2C.
Strength
Similar analyses were performed on the peak t-values, taken
as an index of activation strength of the representations in
M1 concerning hand movements (i.e. the maximal t-value

 index was not significantly different between TMSR and
healthy controls (W = 31.0, P = 0.37), but differed between
TMSR
and
non-TMSR
controls
(W = 23.0,
P = 0.04).
Although the comparison between non-TMSR and healthy
controls was not significant, there was a trend towards smal-
ler indices in non-TMSR patients compared to healthy con-
trols, as expected (W = 39.0, P = 0.10). The distribution of
individual data for all participants for M1 strength indices is
shown in Fig. 2E.
Similar analyses were performed for wrist and elbow
movements, and led to findings similar to hand activations
(Supplementary material and Supplementary Fig. 2).
Distance
To study whether in addition to the normal extent and
strength of M1 activations, patients with TMSR also
have a normal location and topographical sequence of ac-
tivations of the different movements in M1, we localized
the centres of mass of activation clusters for hand move-
ments and tongue movements in each hemisphere and cal-
culated
their
distance
(measured
as
the
3D-Euclidian
distance) as a proxy of reorganization due to amputation
(Supplementary material and Supplementary Fig. 3). This
distance index was calculated by subtracting the hand-to-
tongue centre of mass distance in the right hemisphere
(contralateral to amputation in unilateral amputees) and
in the left hemisphere (Supplementary Fig. 3). The distance
index was close to zero in healthy controls, confirming a
symmetrically large distance between the representations of
the hand and tongue in both hemispheres and the same was
found for both patient groups. In none of the TMSR pa-
tients were these indices significantly different from healthy
and non-TMSR controls at the single-subject level (non-sig-
nificant Crawford tests) (all P 4 0.06). Thus, in terms of
distance in M1 between body representations, TMSR pa-
tients did not differ from the two control groups (healthy
and non-TMSR).
These analyses of M1 activity induced by movements of
the amputated limb suggest that TMSR results in an almost
normal representation of hand movements in contralateral
M1 in extent and strength, which were reduced in non-
TMSR patients. The location of these different body part
representations did not differ between TMSR, non-TMSR
patients and healthy controls.
S1 mapping
Activation maps in S1 induced by tactile stimulation of the
different body regions are shown in Fig. 3A. For Patient
TMSR-01, we observed significant activations within the
right S1 (contralateral to the amputated limb) in response
to the stimulation of all three skin areas of the residual
limb that elicited hand sensations (i.e. the index, the
middle finger, and the palm on the left reinnervated
residual
limb).
The
representations
of
the
amputated
hand were located in corresponding portions of right S1
(i.e. compared to those representing the right healthy
hand in left S1). For Patient TMSR-02, we observed a sig-
nificant activation within right S1 (though small in size) in
response to the stimulation of the regions of the left chest
resulting in sensations on the amputated left index finger
and on the amputated left little finger. These activations
were contralateral and at a corresponding location within
S1 with respect to the representation of the fingers of the
non-amputated hand. For Patient TMSR-03 (who suffered
bilateral amputation), the stimulation of the different body
parts did not yield any significant response within S1 on
either side of the body. Patient TMSR-03 was then
excluded from further S1 analyses. These S1 maps suggest
that multiple and reliable finger-specific S1 representations
of the missing hand are accessible in TMSR patients.
Activations evoked by stimulation of the healthy side of
the body resulted in well-defined somatotopically organized
activity in the contralateral S1 in TMSR, non-TMSR and
healthy control groups.
To compare statistically the S1 representations for the
amputated and the healthy limb we performed the same
analyses as performed for M1 (extent, strength, distance).
Thus, we also computed the difference between contralat-
eral S1 activity when stimulating the amputated versus the
healthy limb. For each patient, these values were compared
to the homologous indices computed in healthy controls
(i.e. as the difference between activity evoked by left and
right upper limb stimulation in the contralateral S1).
Extent
Concerning the number of voxels in TMSR patients, the
index of activation extent was close to 0 and not signifi-
cantly different to healthy controls in Patient TMSR-02
(t = �0.01, P = 0.50) and was even positive in Patient
TMSR-01 (t = 5.19, P 5 0.001) (Fig. 3B). Thus, S1 activity
evoked by applying touch to reinnervated skin regions that
induces tactile sensation on the missing hand and fingers
was comparable (or even enhanced) in extent with respect
to S1 activations induced by stimulation of the contralat-
eral healthy limb. Compared to non-TMSR controls, the
index
was
significantly
larger
for
Patient
TMSR-01
(t = 2.67,
P = 0.02),
but
not
for
Patient
TMSR-02
(t = 0.43,
P = 0.35).
Group-level
comparisons
did
not
reveal any significant difference between the three groups
(all P 4 0.29). The distribution of individual data for all
participants for S1 extent indices is shown in Fig. 3C.
Strength
S1 activity evoked by stimulation of reinnervated skin re-
gions was lower in intensity, as compared to stimulation of
the healthy limb and this was found in all TMSR patients.
Indeed, activation indices for t-max values were negative in
all TMSR patients and different from those in healthy con-
trols (t = �2.31, P = 0.02; t = �1.79, P = 0.05 for Patients
TMSR-01 and TMSR-02), but did not differ from those in
non-TMSR controls (all P 4 0.3) (Fig. 3D). This was con-
firmed by group-level comparisons showing lower values in
TMSR patients compared to healthy controls (W = 3.0,

TMSR controls (W = 10.0, P = 0.86). In addition, indices
for non-TMSR controls were smaller compared to healthy

ual data for all participants for S1 strength indices is shown

Distance
To study whether TMSR also resulted in a differential re-
organization of S1 as compared to non-TMSR amputees,
for each participant we calculated the 3D-Euclidian dis-
tance between the centres of mass of the representations
of the index finger and the lips in each hemisphere

 (Fig. 4A). The distance index in S1 was calculated by sub-
tracting the lip-to-hand distance in the right hemisphere
(contralateral to amputation) and in the left hemisphere
(Fig. 4B). This index was close to 0 for the TMSR ampu-
tees, where hands and lips representations were symmet-
rical and not significantly different than those in healthy
controls (t = 0.44, P = 0.33; and t = 0.21, P = 0.42 for
Patients TMSR-01 and TMSR-02). This was confirmed
by group-level comparison between TMSR patients and
healthy controls (W = 15.0, P = 1). Both single patient
and group level comparisons between TMSR patients and
non-TMSR
controls
did
not
reach
significance
(all
P 4 0.12), likely due to the small sample size. Group
level comparison between non-TMSR and healthy controls
showed significantly lower values in non-TMSR (W = 33.0,
P = 0.02), compatible with S1 reorganization, with an in-
vasion of face areas into the hand areas for the hemisphere
contralateral to amputation. The distribution of individual
data for all participants for S1 distance indices is shown in
Fig. 4C.
To summarize, the TMSR procedure is associated with a
residual somatotopic representation in S1 hand region for
the parts of the missing limb whose peripheral nerves were
retargeted to different skin regions and whose stimulation
leads to tactile sensation on the missing hand and fingers.
The extent of those representations was similar to those of
homologous body parts in the contralateral hemisphere, as
in healthy controls. However, the strength of these repre-
sentations was weaker as compared to those for the intact
body parts on the healthy limb and to healthy controls.

 Functional connectivity between M1
and S1 and between M1/S1 and the
sensorimotor network
To study how M1 and S1 limb representations were inter-
connected functionally and how each area was integrated
with
the
SMN,
we
analysed
resting
state
functional
connectivity between (i) the hand maps in M1 and in S1;
(ii) the hand maps in M1 and SMN; and (iii) the hand
maps in S1 and SMN. The results are presented in Fig. 5.
For the M1-S1 analysis, we compared the strength of
functional connectivity in the hemisphere contralateral and
ipsilateral to amputation by computing an index of M1-S1
connectivity as the difference between the connectivity
Z-scores for the right and the left hemisphere. This index
was positive in Patient TMSR-01, close to zero in Patient
TMSR-02, and in both cases within the normal limits ob-
tained in healthy controls (t = 0.41, P = 0.35 and t = �0.15,
P = 0.44, respectively), indicating a symmetric pattern of
connectivity between the primary motor and somatosensory
cortices. The same index was negative in non-TMSR pa-
tients, although there was no statistical difference when
computing single patient comparisons between TMSR pa-
tients and the group of non-TMSR patients (t = 1.39,
P = 0.11 for Patient TMSR-01 and t = 1.06, P = 0.17 for
Patient TMSR-02). Statistical analysis at the group level
showed a significant difference in connectivity indices be-
tween non-TMSR and healthy controls, showing reduced
connectivity in non-TMSR amputees (Wilcoxon rank-sum
test, W = 33.0, P = 0.02), but not between TMSR patients
and healthy controls (W = 18.0, P = 0.66), showing more
normal connectivity in TMSR patients (Fig. 5B and C).
We then analysed the functional connectivity between M1-
SMN and between S1-SMN in TMSR, non-TMSR controls
and healthy controls. Connectivity indices were computed as
the difference in Z-scores for M1-SMN and S1-SMN connect-
ivity in the right (contralateral to amputation for patients)
minus the left hemisphere (ipsilateral to amputation for pa-
tients). Concerning M1-SMN connectivity, the indices were
positive in all TMSR patients and not different from healthy
controls (Patient TMSR-01: t = 0.17, P = 0.44; Patient TMSR-
02: t = 0.93, P = 0.19; Patient TMSR-03: t = 0.52, P = 0.31)
(Fig. 5D and E). These indices were on average negative in
non-TMSR controls indicating stronger M1-SMN connectiv-
ity (for the healthy limb region compared to the amputated
limb region). Statistical comparisons between single TMSR
patients and the group of non-TMSR patients did not
reveal significant differences (Patient TMSR-01: t = 0.54,
P = 0.31;
Patient
TMSR-02:
t = 1.01,
P = 0.18;
Patient
TMSR-03: t = 0.76, P = 0.24) (Fig. 5D and E). There were
no significant differences at the group level (all P4 0.26).
For S1-SMN indices, functional connectivity indices were
positive for Patient TMSR-01 and negative for Patient
TMSR-02. These indices were on average negative in
non-TMSR controls and close to zero in healthy controls.
Single subject comparisons showed no differences between
TMSR patients and healthy controls (Patient TMSR-01:
t = 0.19, P = 0.43; Patient TMSR-02: t = �1.12, P = 0.14)
(Fig. 5F and G), or between TMSR patients and non-
TMSR
controls
(Patient
TMSR-01:
t = 0.67,
P = 0.27;
Patient TMSR-02: t = �0.09, P = 0.47) (Fig. 5F and G).
At the group level, there were no statistical differences be-
tween the three groups (all P 4 0.18).
Taken together, these results suggest that TMSR is asso-
ciated with normal connectivity between S1 and M1, while
such connectivity is reduced in non-TMSR amputees.
Connectivity results between M1/S1 and SMN are less con-
sistent, due to large between-subjects variability and low
statistical power. Generally, and confirmed from inspection
of individual data (Fig. 5C, E and G), connectivity between
M1 and SMN appeared not to differ between healthy con-
trols and TMSR participants, and was reduced in non-
TMRS subjects, while the connectivity between S1 and
SMN appeared to be reduced in both groups of patients.
Visual enhancement of touch
Based on the previous results, one might predict that pri-
mary sensory functions of the TMSR skin region are normal
and acquire some of the tactile properties of the missing
hand before amputation, as shown by previous studies
demonstrating enhanced tactile acuity on TMSR regions as
compared to homologous non-reinnervated skin regions
(Marasco et al., 2009). However, because of the partially
reduced functional connectivity between S1 and SMN,
TMSR patients might show impaired multisensory integra-
tive behavioural effects, typically present for intact body rep-
resentations,
as these rely
on
the
interaction
between
unisensory and multisensory areas (Taylor-Clarke et al.,
2002; Ro et al., 2004; Konen and Haggard, 2014). To
test this hypothesis, we studied VET in TMSR amputees,
as an index of visuo-tactile interaction (Kennett et al.,
2001; Serino and Haggard, 2010). VET consists of a facili-
tation of tactile acuity if subjects simultaneously see the sti-
mulated
body
part
(without
seeing
the
actual
tactile
stimulation), as compared to conditions of no visual stimula-
tion, vision of a non-bodily stimulus, or vision of a non-hom-
ologous body part (Serino et al., 2009). Here, we compared
the effectiveness of the VET effect for reinnervated and non-
reinnervated body parts by measuring tactile acuity on TMSR
and non-TMSR regions of the residual limb or chest, while
patients were either viewing the body part to which tactile
sensations were referred to (i.e. the hand or the physically
stimulated body part, i.e. the arm in Patient TMSR-01 or
chest in Patients TMSR-02 and TMSR-03). These results
were compared to the VET effect in healthy participants on
the hand and the chest (see ‘Materials and methods’ section).
In line with previous reports (Kennett et al., 2001;
Haggard et al., 2007; Serino et al., 2009), in healthy par-
ticipants, tactile acuity (d’ scores) was higher when visual
information matched the stimulated body part (Fig. 6). The
ANOVA run on d0 scores with Stimulation type (‘Touch
Hand’, ‘Touch Chest’) and Congruency of visual feedback

showed
a

of
Congruency
[F(1,17) = 25.55, P 5 0.0001]. Since there was no main
effect of stimulation type, hand and chest data were aver-
aged for further analysis. Thus, in healthy participants, a
clear somatotopic pattern in the VET effect was found
(Serino et al., 2009), both for the hand and the chest.
As shown in Fig. 6, in all TMSR patients, an amelior-
ation of tactile acuity was found when tactile stimulation
was administered on the non-TMSR skin region when pa-
tients were looking at the congruent body part (chest or
arm), as compared to when they were looking at a hand,
thus showing a somatotopically determined VET effect.
However, crucially, for the present study, this effect was
absent when tactile stimulation was provided to the TMSR
region (chest or residual limb) evoking tactile perception on
the hand while patients were looking at the hand, as com-
pared to when looking at their chest or arm.
To provide statistical support to these observations, we
calculated an index of the VET effect for the TMSR and
the non-TMSR region as the difference in d0 scores when
viewing the body part stimulated (congruent) or when

 viewing the other body part (incongruent). Those values were
compared to the analogues indices computed in healthy con-
trols for VET effect (d0 congruent � d0 incongruent). For the
non-TMSR regions, the VET index was equivalent in the
three TMSR patients to the VET index in healthy controls
(Crawford test: Patient TMSR-01: t = 1.03, P = 0.16; Patient
TMSR-02: t = 0.21, P = 0.42; Patient TMSR-03: t = �0.42,
P = 0.34). In contrast, the VET index for the TMSR region
was significantly lower in Patients TMSR-02 and TMSR-03
compared to in controls, with a trend for Patient TMSR-01
(Patient TMSR-01: t = �1.13, P = 0.13; Patient TMSR-02:
t = �2.47, P = 0.01; Patient TMSR-03: t = �1.68, P = 0.05).
These findings were confirmed by group-level analyses, show-
ing equivalent VET indices for non-TMSR regions in patients
compared to controls (Wilcoxon rank-sum test: W = 40.0,
P = 0.51), and significantly lower indices for TMSR regions
in patients compared to controls (W = 9.0, P = 0.02). Thus,
these psychophysical data reveal an absence of visuo-tactile
interaction for TMSR body regions.
Discussion
This study is the first systematic investigation of how a
bionic
prosthesis
for
upper
limb
amputees
based
on
TMSR impacts the functional organization of the missing
limb in M1 and S1, their mutual connectivity, and their
connectivity with the frontoparietal sensorimotor network.
We report that, first, the M1 maps for hand and arm move-
ments controlling the prosthetic limb appear intact in
TMSR patients: they are similar in extent and strength
compared to healthy individuals performing the same ac-
tions with physically existing limbs and are stronger than
those in non-TMSR amputees. Second, S1 activity evoked
by applying touch to reinnervated skin regions on the chest
or residual limb (inducing tactile sensation on the missing
hand) activated well-defined portions in locations that were
comparable to the normal hand region in S1, although
these activations were weaker compared to healthy con-
trols. Third, TMSR is associated with normal local func-
tional connectivity between M1-S1 upper limb regions,
whereas this was not the case for non-TMSR amputees.
Finally, functional connectivity with sensorimotor areas
was reduced in both amputee groups for S1 and associated
with the absence of the VET, shown previously to depend
on projections to S1 from multisensory regions in the su-
perior parietal cortex and ventral premotor cortex (Serino
and Haggard, 2009), part of the sensorimotor network.
Although these findings are based on a relatively limited
sample of patients, primarily due to the fact that TMSR
patients are rare (see limitations of the study section), we
were able to exploit the high spatial resolution of ultra

 high-field 7 T functional MRI and single case analysis.
Here, we discuss what these findings reveal about plasticity
of body maps in S1 and in M1 and the relevance of our
findings for current and future approaches in bionic limbs.
TMSR reinstates M1 upper limb
representation
In order to map motor cortex in amputees, we used a
paradigm employed by previous investigators, consisting
of asking patients to perform movements with their ampu-
tated limb or with their mouth and studied the associated
functional MRI activity in M1 (Lotze et al., 1999; Makin
et al., 2013a, 2015b; van den Heiligenberg et al., 2015).
Due to the lower spatial resolution of earlier work using
1.5 T or 3 T functional MRI (and because of somatosen-
sory-related processing associated with the tested move-
ments), previous reports were not able to distinguish
between motor versus somatosensory evoked activity or
whether the activity was in the anterior or posterior
banks of the central sulcus. Accordingly, it was not separ-
ately investigated how M1 and S1 contributed to the re-
ported activation patterns in amputees. Across these studies
it was found that, compared to healthy participants, sen-
sorimotor activations in upper limb amputees differ in
terms of strength, extent and location (see Reilly and
Sirigu, 2008 for a review). Extending our previous work
on human S1 using ultra high-field functional MRI in
healthy subjects (Martuzzi et al., 2014, 2015; Akselrod
et al., 2017) we were here able to separately investigate
S1 and M1 in TMSR patients. We found that the M1 ac-
tivations during movements of the phantom limb in non-
TMSR amputees were reduced in terms of extension and
strength compared to healthy controls, in line with previous
findings (reporting activations in M1 and S1). This was
different in the three TMSR patients in whom M1 activa-
tions were comparable to controls. Thus, M1 activity
related to the control of the prosthetic limb (via decoded
EMG signals recorded from muscles reinnervated by re-
sidual arm nerves) is associated with normal upper limb
activations in TMSR amputees. This suggests that the func-
tional solicitation of M1 upper limb areas associated with
the use of a prosthetic limb is potentially able to reinstate
normal M1 maps. In all participants (TMSR, non-TMSR
and healthy controls), the mapped motor activations were
located on the precentral gyrus corresponding to M1, and
showed the normal somatotopic organization within M1,
compatible with a recent 7 T study reporting finger soma-
totopy in M1 in healthy participants (Siero et al., 2014).
We note that although the somatotopic organization was
observed in all participants, the exact location of motor
maps differed across participants, highlighting the import-
ance of single subject analysis at ultra-high field strength to
study the organization of M1.
We also measured the degree of cortical reorganization
within
M1
following
amputation,
by
quantifying
the
displacement of mouth activations towards the missing
hand activations as measured by previous authors using
1.5 or 3 T functional MRI (Lotze et al., 1999, 2001; see
Mercier et al., 2006; Reilly et al., 2006; Reilly and Sirigu,
2008 for evidence from TMS). The present 7 T functional
MRI investigation, however, did not reveal any evidence
for cortical reorganization (i.e. changes in the location of
the lip M1 representation with respect to the hand M1
representation in either group of amputees). Some import-
ant studies in the field suggest that the amount of cortical
reorganization is strongly correlated with the degree of
phantom pain (Flor et al., 1995; Lotze et al., 2001). One
recent report showed a small, but consistent displacement
of lip representation, which was, however, not correlated to
phantom limb pain (Makin et al., 2015b). Considering
these controversial reports, currently the existence and
nature of the relationship between the phenomenology of
phantom limbs and cortical reorganization following limb
loss remains unclear. The present data do not allow us to
draw firm conclusions about it in TMSR patients, because
of the small sample size. On the one hand, the absence of
phantom limb pain in two of three TMSR patients in the
present study would predict low cortical reorganization ac-
cordingly to Flor et al.’s (1995) findings. On the other
hand, the patient who presented chronic and severe phan-
tom pain, i.e. Patient TMSR-03, did not show significant
cortical
reorganization.
However,
he
suffered
bilateral
shoulder disarticulation, which may have induced a rather
different pattern of cortical reorganization as compared to
unilateral amputees, previously tested. A previous study
with larger sample size (n = 28) suggested that TMSR is a
promising approach to reduce neuroma pain (Souza et al.,
2014). It would be interesting in the future to test cortical
reorganization in these patients to provide novel insight
about the relationship between cortical reorganization and
pain and the role of TMSR in modulating it.
TMSR allows accessing S1 upper limb
representation
Mapping somatosensory activations of the missing limb in
S1 in amputees has been more challenging than mapping
movements in M1 (Yang et al., 1994; Flor et al., 1995;
Ramachandran et al., 1995; Bjo
¨rkman et al., 2012).
Influential MEG studies assessed the maps of the missing
limb in S1 by stimulating the patient’s lip region and re-
vealed evidence for a distorted somatotopic organization in
S1 after amputation, suggesting that the face area shifted
medially towards or into the hand area (Yang et al., 1994;
Flor et al., 1995; Ramachandran et al., 1995). A more
recent 3 T functional MRI study investigated the maps of
the missing limb in S1 by stimulating specific residual limb
regions that evoked referred tactile sensations on the miss-
ing hand (Bjo
¨rkman et al., 2012). These authors found that
activity in several S1 regions that were activated by stimu-
lation of the residual limb showed differences in location

 and extent depending on whether stimulation induced
referred tactile sensation on the missing hand or not
(Bjo
¨rkman et al., 2012). In the present study, we used
7 T functional MRI and extended this approach to TMSR
patients, in whom specific tactile-referred sensations can be
induced by stimulating reinnervated skin regions on the
chest or the residual arm. Such surgically reinnervated
skin regions have the advantage of covering larger portions
of skin and of being spatially well segregated, offering a
high resolution tactile interface to induce controlled, reli-
able and specific phantom limb sensations in TMSR
patients (Kuiken et al., 2007a; Hebert et al., 2014). Thus,
we asked whether spontaneous S1 reorganization as occur-
ring in non-TMSR-amputees, differs from S1 reorganiza-
tion
associated
with
the
surgical
redirection
of
somatosensory nerve fibres in the TMSR procedure. Our
data reveal two findings. First, S1 tactile activations con-
cerning the missing limb of TMSR patients were located at
a position corresponding to the S1 hand activations in
healthy controls, although they were weaker in terms of
strength of activation. Second, TMSR-related S1 activations
were somatotopically organized and comparable to those in
healthy controls (based on the distance between hand and
lip representations); this was not the case for non-TMSR
patients, who showed larger shifts of maps in S1. The dis-
placement of the lip map has been proposed as a marker of
maladaptive plasticity in amputee patients, due to lack of
hand-related sensory inputs in amputation (Flor et al.,
1995). Moreover, the degree of such maladaptive changes
has been related to the level of phantom pain in amputees
(but see Makin et al., 2013a, 2015b) and has been shown
to be reversible after an extensive tactile training over the
residual limb region, which also decreased pain ratings
(Flor et al., 2001). Based on these earlier findings and on
the normal topographical S1 organization and smaller
degree of maladaptive plasticity found in TMSR patients,
we speculate that TMSR might reduce maladaptive plasti-
city in S1 (in addition to M1) maps by restoring the rep-
resentations of the missing limb and may potentially
prevent
or
diminish
phantom
limb-related
symptoms.
However, we note that the present investigation, based
on data from three TMSR patients, was not aimed at
and does not allow for establishing a direct link between
S1 organization and phantom limb pain.
TMSR reinstates functional
connectivity between M1-S1 upper
limb maps
The interaction between motor and somatosensory maps is
crucial during action execution and studies in healthy sub-
jects have revealed strong functional connectivity within a
network formed by the motor and somatosensory cortex
and other higher-order sensorimotor areas (e.g. premotor
cortex, Yeo et al., 2011), as well as with association cortex
(e.g. the superior parietal lobe, Rizzolatti and Matelli,
2003; Markov et al., 2013), i.e. the so-called SMN
(Biswal et al., 1995; Lowe et al., 1998; Xiong et al.,
1999; Cordes et al., 2000, 2001; Beckmann et al., 2005;
De Luca et al., 2005; Fox et al., 2006). This sensorimotor
functional connectivity has been shown to be altered in
many clinical conditions, such as stroke or schizophrenia
(Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2001; Gerloff et al., 2006;
Mostofsky et al., 2009; Helmich et al., 2010; Wang
et al., 2010). Recently, it has been observed in amputees
that the functional connectivity between the representation
of the missing limb and the rest of the SMN is decreased
(Makin et al., 2015a). Based on the present high resolution
and functionally specific mapping approach, we were able
to directly test M1-S1 connectivity and found that the M1
hand map was normally connected with the S1 hand map
in TMSR patients, while M1-S1 functional connectivity
was
significantly
reduced
in
non-TMSR
amputees.
Together M1-S1 connectivity data and M1 and S1 mapping
data suggest therefore that the TMSR procedure is asso-
ciated with normal upper limb sensorimotor maps and
stronger functional mutual interconnections between M1
and S1, as compared to non-TMSR amputees.
On the other hand, upper limb control and perception
depend not only on neural processing within motor and
unisensory cortices, but on a more widely distributed net-
work of areas integrating multisensory and motor signals
that involve higher-level motor regions and multisensory
regions in the posterior parietal cortex. In particular, the
posterior parietal cortex and the premotor cortex contain
neuronal populations integrating multisensory bodily signals
(Graziano and Botvinick, 2002; Berlucchi and Aglioti, 2010;
Serino and Haggard, 2010; Blanke et al., 2015), and neural
processing in these areas has been linked to multisensory
visuo-tactile stimulation and the sense of hand ownership
(Ehrsson et al., 2004, 2005; Gentile et al., 2015; Grivaz
et al., 2017). Prominent functional and structural connect-
ivity exist between posterior parietal and premotor areas,
part of the sensorimotor network and primary motor and
somatosensory regions (Rushworth et al., 2006; Tomassini
et al., 2007; Uddin et al., 2010; Mars et al., 2011; Yeo
et al., 2011), underlying motor execution and motor im-
agery
(Solodkin
et
al.,
2004;
Gao
et
al.,
2011).
Therapeutically, paradigms used to treat phantom limb syn-
drome (such as the mirror box therapy) directly exploit the
multisensory nature of limb representation and likely rely
on multimodal (i.e. visuo-somatosensory-motor) maps of
the upper limb within an extended multisensory-motor net-
work
(Chan
et
al.,
2007;
Ehrsson
et
al.,
2008;
Ramachandran and Altschuler, 2009). When we investi-
gated the integrity of functional connectivity of M1 and
of S1 with the rest of the SMN, including key parietal
and premotor multisensory regions, we found less consistent
and solid results as compared to S1-M1 connectivity data,
likely due to higher variability between individuals, com-
bined with low statistical power. In general, the upper
limb functional maps identified in M1 appeared functionally
connected with the rest of the SMN in TMSR patients.

 Instead, individual patients’ data suggested reduced connect-
ivity between S1 unimodal and multimodal areas both for
non-TMSR and TMSR patients. These results extend recent
reports by Makin et al. (2015a) showing that in amputees,
the combined S1-M1 map of the missing limb is less con-
nected with the SMN, as defined by Beckmann et al. (2005).
Importantly, our connectivity results show that only distant
(i.e. within the whole sensorimotor network), but not local
(i.e. between M1 and S1) connectivity of the upper limb is
impaired in TMSR patients. Thus, although the repetitive
movements of the EMG-driven myoelectric prosthesis in
TMSR patients seems to reinstate M1 (and partially S1)
representations and their mutual local functional connectiv-
ity, current TMSR systems do not completely normalize
connectivity with more distant parietal and premotor multi-
sensory regions.
The latter finding, and in particular the reduced connect-
ivity between S1 and SMN, was further supported by the
behavioural data on VET, showing that—although touch
sensation on the missing limb can be reliably evoked in
TMSR patients—this information is not integrated with
visual bodily cues. Indeed, viewing a hand, while performing
a tactile spatial discrimination task on the reinnervated skin
region, did not improve tactile perception in TMSR patients:
the VET effect that occurs in healthy participants (Kennett
et al., 2001; Haggard et al., 2003; Serino and Haggard,
2010) is absent for the reinnervated body part in TMSR
patients. The VET effect depends on the integration of
visual cues related to the body with tactile inputs, based
on projections from multimodal areas in posterior parietal
cortex to S1 (Taylor-Clarke et al., 2002; Ro et al., 2004;
Serino et al., 2009; Cardini et al., 2011; Konen and
Haggard, 2014). The lack of hand-related VET in TMSR
patients, therefore, corroborates the reduction of functional
interactions between the sensorimotor network and S1 hand
maps. We speculate that this is due to the fact that current
TMSR interfaces do not utilize somatosensory inputs (via
the reinnervated skin regions) in current prostheses. Such
integrated tactile input seems important for the development
of future TMSR devices as under normal conditions, when
we move our hands and touch different objects, we receive
coherent visual, auditory, tactile, and proprioceptive cues
that the brains integrates for optimal control (Maravita
et al., 2003; Blanke et al., 2015). However, in current
TMSR prostheses (and most other bionic limbs), motor com-
mands generated to drive the prosthesis are controlled only
with visual information related to the prosthetic limb, with-
out integrated somatosensory feedback. Our behavioural
and imaging data suggest that current procedures are not
able to reinstate multimodal upper limb representations
that are based on interactions between unimodal and multi-
modal hand maps.
Limitations of the study
The present study suffers from limitations. First, because
TMSR patients belong to a very rare population, the
number of TMSR patients investigated in this study is rela-
tively small. For this reason, we used a single-subject ap-
proach to fully describe their results. At the same time,
generalization to the group-level based on these results
should be considered with caution. In addition, given the
small number of patients, we could not establish any link
between upper limb representation in S1 and M1 and clin-
ical features of phantom limb syndrome, such as pain,
which is a topic of debate in the field (see Flor et al.
1995; Makin et al., 2013a, b; Souza et al., 2014).
Second, we could not assess the effects of TMSR in a
pre/post-intervention
design;
therefore
the
results
are
based on comparisons with other control subjects, rather
than longitudinal within-subject
comparisons. For this
reason, we are not able to determine whether TMSR pre-
vents cortical reorganization in sensorimotor areas or
rather restores a normal organization in these areas.
Third, considering that there was no blind design, we
cannot completely rule out the possible presence of uncon-
scious biases from the experimenter who administered som-
atosensory
stimulation.
Nevertheless,
the
experimenter
providing the stimulation was highly trained prior to data
acquisition to reduce the variability of the stimulation, and
we have used a method that is consolidated (Martuzzi
et al., 2014, 2015), whereas sometimes automatic mechan-
ical stimulation leads to inconclusive results (van der
Zwaag et al., 2015). A similar argument holds for motor
mapping, as we cannot rule out unconscious biases in our
amputee patients when performing phantom movements
(for example asymmetry in effort). Nevertheless, all patients
were well trained and able to easily execute the task before
entering the scanning and it is unlikely that TMSR and
non-TMSR patients could bias the results of the study in
the direction predicted by our experimental hypotheses. In
addition, we note that the sample size of the non-TMSR
group is relatively small. Although the statistical approach
considered in the present study specifically addresses this
issue (Crawford and Garthwaite, 2002) and although the
results obtained for the non-TMSR group are in line with
results reported in studies using larger samples (Reilly and
Sirigu, 2008), generalization of the present results to all
non-TMSR patients, based on the present data, should be
regarded with caution.
Conclusions and outlook
‘Closing the loop’ between motor control and sensory feed-
back is a key target for the next generation of bidirectional
neuroprosthetic devices. Recent advances have been made
with peripheral implants (Raspopovic et al., 2014) and
likely target the brain and S1 in particular (i.e. Bensmaia
and Miller, 2014; Bensmaia, 2015) to inject tactile infor-
mation sensed by the prosthetic device directly into the
nervous system. These advancements may not only improve
prosthesis control during hand-object interaction, but may
also
minimize

 prostheses
acceptance
and
somatosensory
experiences.
Indeed, current models in neuroscience propose that com-
plex bodily experiences such as the experience of the body
as one’s own (body ownership) normally arise through the
integration of multisensory body-related cues, within a dis-
tributed network of unisensory and multi-sensory fronto-
parietal areas (Tsakiris, 2010; Blanke, 2012; Ehrsson,
2012; Blanke et al., 2015). A prosthesis, being able not
only to transform the patient’s motor commands into
movements of the prosthesis, but also to interface motor
control with integrated multisensory signals from the ro-
botic hand and objects it is in contact with, may be felt
like a real limb (De Preester and Tsakiris, 2014; Bensmaia,
2015). Such an embodied prosthetic limb would become
‘part of the patient’s body’ and have less maladaptive plas-
ticity through full functional integration within and beyond
the sensorimotor cortex. Recent experiments with bidirec-
tional signal flow including somatosensory feedback to the
reinnervated skin regions (Marasco et al., 2011) or the
peripheral nervous system (Raspopovic et al., 2014) suggest
that this is feasible and potentially effective.
