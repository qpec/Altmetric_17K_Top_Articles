Context: Women are at increased risk for mood disturbance during the menopause transition. Hot
flashes (HFs), sleep disruption, and fluctuating estradiol levels correlate with menopause-associ-
ated depression but co-occur, making cause and effect relationships difficult to disentangle.
Objective: Using a GnRH agonist (GnRHa) experimental model, we investigated whether depres-
sive symptoms are associated with HFs and/or are explained by concomitant sleep fragmentation
in the absence of estradiol fluctuation.
Design and Intervention: Depressive symptoms, objective polysomnographic sleep parameters,
subjective sleep quality, serum estradiol, and HFs were assessed before and 4 weeks after open-
label depot GnRHa (leuprolide 3.75-mg) administration.
Setting: Academic medical center.
Participants: Twenty-nine healthy nondepressed premenopausal volunteers (mean age, 27.3 years).
Results: Serum estradiol was rapidly and uniformly suppressed. HFs developed in 69% of the
subjects.Onunivariateanalysis,worseningofmoodwaspredictedbyincreasesintimeinlightsleep
(stage N1), number of transitions to wake, non-REM arousals, subjective sleep quality, and reduc-
tions in perceived sleep efficiency (all P � .045), as well as the number of nighttime (P � .006), but
not daytime (P � .28), HFs reported. In adjusted models, the number of nighttime HFs reported,
increases in non-REM arousals, time in stage N1, transitions to wake, and reduced sleep quality
remained significant predictors of mood deterioration (P � .05).
Conclusions: Depressive symptoms emerged after estradiol withdrawal in association with objec-
tively and subjectively measured sleep disturbance and the number of nighttime, but not daytime,
HFs reported. Results suggest that sleep disruption and perceived nighttime HFs both contribute
to vulnerability to menopause-associated depressive symptoms in hypoestrogenic women. (J Clin

 W
omen are at increased risk for developing both ma-
jor depressive episodes and, more commonly, sub-
syndromal depressive symptoms during the perimeno-
pause (or menopause transition), early postmenopause (1,
2), and immediately after bilateral oophorectomy (3). De-
pressive symptoms increase when estradiol levels change
markedly in association with both natural and surgical
menopause. During the menopause transition, greater
variability in serum estradiol is associated with an in-
creased likelihood of depressive symptoms (4). This asso-
ciation suggests that central nervous system effects of es-
tradiol may influence mood because of interactions with
neurotransmitter and intracellular mechanisms that reg-
ulate affect. However, withdrawal of and variability in
estradiolarelikelynottheonlymenopause-specificfactors
underlying susceptibility to mood disturbance. The risk of
subsyndromal depressive symptoms remains elevated
when estradiol levels are static and stably low in the late
menopause transition, early postmenopause (5, 6), and
after oophorectomy (3).
Hot flashes (HFs) are the hallmark symptom of meno-
pause, occurring in up to 80% of women (7). They are also
the primary symptomatic response to bilateral oophorec-
tomy. These episodic events occur during the daytime and
also at night, when they disrupt sleep (8). Multiple studies
have demonstrated that HFs are associated with a greater
likelihood of depressive symptoms (4, 9–14). When HFs
precede and/or co-occur with the onset of depressive
symptoms (14), the association has been variably attrib-
uted to: 1) sleep disruption; 2) moodiness related to day-
time discomfort; and 3) a shared central nervous system
mechanism among those who are susceptible.
Sleep disturbance is strongly linked with depressive
symptoms during the menopause transition (13, 15), but
it is less clear whether sleep disturbance is a constituent
symptom of depression or a predisposing factor (16). In
addition, the independent contributions of sleep distur-
bance and HFs have not been disentangled in women with
both symptoms. Available studies examining the contri-
bution of HFs and sleep disturbance to depression have
generally used infrequent assessments of HFs and mood
and have not separated daytime from nighttime HFs, lim-
iting their ability to isolate menopause-related factors
from each other and dissect mechanistic pathways under-
lying these commonly co-occurring symptoms. It is im-
portant to understand the impact of sleep and HFs on
natural and surgical menopause-associated mood distur-
bance to assist clinicians in prioritizing which specific
symptom should be prioritized when treating mood dis-
turbance in these women.
In the current study, we used the GnRH agonist (Gn-
RHa) leuprolide in healthy premenopausal women to dis-
sect the specific impact of nighttime HFs from sleep dis-
turbance and daytime HFs on mood. This model has been
used previously to demonstrate the impact of ovarian sup-
pression on menopause- and menstrual-related mood dis-
turbance (17, 18), but not to examine the contribution of
HFsandsleeptodepressivesymptoms.TheGnRHamodel
provides a valuable experimental approach to isolate the
specific effect of these factors because HFs are induced
rapidly and occur at variable frequency in two-thirds of
women (19–23), permitting measurement of within-sub-
ject changes in sleep patterns and mood in the temporal
relation to the onset of HFs (8). Because ovarian suppres-
sion is uniformly induced and sustained, the impact of HFs
and sleep on mood can be examined in the absence of
estradiol fluctuations. We hypothesized that sleep disrup-
tion would explain changes in mood seen in women ex-
periencing new-onset HFs, but that neither nighttime nor
daytime HFs would contribute to the emergence of de-
pressive symptoms.
Subjects and Methods
Twenty-nine healthy premenopausal women who were 18–45
years old and had no HFs, sleep disorders, or psychiatric illnesses
were enrolled in this experimental protocol. All received one
open-label dose of leuprolide to rapidly induce hypoestrogenism
and maintain ovarian suppression for the study period (19, 24).
Depressive symptoms were measured before and 4 weeks after
GnRHa administration, concurrent with ambulatory polysom-
nographic studies, and after continuous monitoring of subjective
HFs and sleep patterns. All subjects provided written informed
consent for study procedures, which were approved by the Part-
ners HealthCare Institutional Review Board and conducted at
Massachusetts General Hospital.
Study subjects
Subjects were screened to select healthy 18- to 45-year-old
women with regular menstrual cycles, evidence of ovulatory cy-
cles (midluteal serum progesterone � 3 ng/mL), and no HFs.
Those with primary sleep disorders were excluded by routine
screening polysomnography (PSG). The clinician-rated Mont-
gomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (25, 26) was
used to exclude women with significant depressive symptoms
(MADRS � 10) at baseline. Other psychiatric exclusion criteria
(current and previous major depressive disorder, bipolar disor-
der, psychosis, anorexia nervosa, substance-use disorders, and
suicide attempts) were determined using the Mini-International
Neuropsychiatric Interview. Medical exclusions were preg-
nancy, lactation, abnormal laboratory studies, and use of sys-
temic hormones, antidepressants, and other medications that are
centrally active or known to suppress HFs. Mood symptoms
occurring premenstrually, postpartum, or on hormonal birth
control were reported.

 Procedures
After completing the screening procedures, baseline mood
(MADRS and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]), sleep (sleep
diary, questionnaires, two ambulatory PSG studies), and repro-
ductive hormone levels were obtained before one dose of im
leuprolide 3.75-mg/d was administered in the midluteal phase.
Serumestradiol,LH,andFSHweremeasuredtoconfirmovarian
suppression. After GnRHa administration, subjects reported the
number of HFs experienced twice each day using daily diaries, in
the morning to reflect the night and in the evening to reflect the
daytime.
Four weeks after GnRHa administration, depressive symp-
toms were reassessed using the MADRS and BDI, as were sleep
parameters using two ambulatory PSG studies. Physiological
HFs were recorded objectively during the post-GnRHa PSG
studies using the Bahr skin-conductance monitor (Simplex Sci-
entific) (27).
Sleep measures
Ambulatory PSG studies (Safiro; Compumedics Limited)
were obtained using electroencephalography (EEG; C3-A2, C4-
A1, O1-A2 O2-A1), bilateral electro-oculography, and submen-
tal electromyography, as previously described (8). Standard
American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring methods
were used to define the amount of time spent in each sleep stage,
including light sleep (stages N1 and N2), deep sleep (stage N3),
and rapid eye movement (REM) (28). Awakenings were defined
as alpha EEG, movement, or eye blinking comprising � 15 sec-
onds of a 30-second epoch. Arousals (total, during REM, and
non-REM) were defined as an abrupt increase in EEG frequency,
notmeetingspindlecriteria,lasting3–15seconds.Lights-outand
lights-on times were recorded using event markers on time-syn-
ched actigraphic watches.
Using manually scored 30-second epochs, sleep stages were
processed via custom MATLAB scripts to extract the start and
stop times of each sleep stage bout to determine the number of
transitions to stage N1 and to wake. A stage transition refers to
entry into a bout of that stage, such that if a subject had 10
transitions to stage N1 in one night, it means that we observed
10 episodes of stage N1 sleep lasting � 30 seconds.
Subjective sleep measures included sleep diaries (measuring
bedtime, final wake-up time, time to fall asleep, number of awak-
enings, wake time after sleep onset [WASO]) obtained through-
out the study, as well as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
(PSQI;range,0–21),whichwasadministeredbeforeand4weeks
after treatment (29).
Hormone assays
Before GnRHa administration and 1, 2, and 4 weeks after-
ward, estradiol was measured using liquid chromatography, tan-
dem mass spectrometry (Mayo Clinic) (30, 31). The interassay
coefficient of variation for estradiol in this range is 8.6% (30).
Serum LH and FSH methods and coefficient of variation were
measured as reported previously (8).
Analysis
The primary outcome was within-subject change in depres-
sive symptoms from pre-GnRHa to 4-week post-GnRHa levels,
using the MADRS (range, 0–60; the higher score being worse).
The primary HF predictors (subjectively reported nighttime and
daytime HFs) and all sleep parameters were modeled continu-
ously. The total number of nighttime and daytime HFs reported
to occur on GnRHa through the second post-treatment PSG
study was calculated as a daily average. Parallel analyses were
conducted using the average number of HFs recorded objectively
during the two post-GnRHa PSG studies. All analyses were re-
peated after excluding the sleep item on the MADRS score and
separately, using the BDI score, as dependent measures.
Objective and subjective sleep parameters were modeled as
change from baseline to the post-treatment assessment. For each
PSG-defined parameter (number of awakenings, WASO, sleep
efficiency, sleep-onset latency, percentage time in each sleep
stage, arousals, and number of transitions per hour to wake or
stage N1), results of the two pre-GnRHa PSG studies were av-
eraged, as were results of the two post-GnRHa PSG studies, to
calculate within-subject change from baseline. A similar ap-
proach was used for sleep diary measures (number of awaken-
ings, WASO, sleep efficiency, sleep-onset latency), with baseline
and 4-week follow-up measures calculated as daily averages
from that 7-day diary.
Linear regression models were used to examine the associa-
tion of HF frequency and each sleep parameter on changes in
depressive symptoms. Univariate models were built using with-
in-subject change in MADRS scores as the dependent measure
and HFs (night or day) and each sleep parameter as the inde-
pendent measure. Bivariate linear models were constructed by
adding each sleep parameter associated with change in depres-
sive symptoms (P � .10 threshold) to a model with HFs (night or
day) if HFs were significantly associated with change in depres-
sive symptoms. Beta coefficients and corresponding 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each predictor. Similar
approaches were used to model the MADRS score after elim-
inating the sleep item as well as the BDI score as dependent
measures and to substitute the number of objectively mea-
sured nighttime HFs for the subjective HF count. Variables
were transformed using winsorization if Cook’s D values for
a model exceeded 1 to reduce the impact of extreme values on
model estimates (32).
Results
Subjects
Table 1 shows baseline characteristics for the 29 study
subjects who were 27.3 � 7.2 years old, predominately
Caucasian, never married, employed, and college gradu-
ates. Premenstrual mood changes were reported by 52%,
hormonal contraceptive-associated mood disturbance by
22%, and postpartum depression by one of four women
who had children. By design, subjects had minimal mood
symptoms at baseline, reflected by a mean pretreatment
MADRS score of 1.0 (SD, 1.1) and a mean pretreatment
BDI score of 0.9 (SD, 1.5). PSG studies and perceived
sleep quality measures revealed normal sleep at baseline
(Table 2).
Change in depressive symptoms
For the group overall, the mean MADRS score after 4
weeks on GnRHa was 4.1 (SD, 5.4). Only one subject

 (3%) had a post-GnRHa MADRS score � 15, suggesting
clinically significant depression. MADRS scores increased
by 3.1 � 5.4 (P � .005) in the group overall. MADRS
scores increased by � 5 points from baseline in 24% of
subjects and remained unchanged (�1 point) in 38%, re-
flecting between-subject variability in the impact of Gn-
RHa on depressive symptoms. On average, the sleep item
on the MADRS accounted for 27% of each person’s total
MADRS score. Demographic characteristics, including a
history of mood disturbance manifesting during the post-
partum, premenstruum, and on contraceptive hormones,
were not associated with depressive symptom emergence.
Impact of GnRHa on reproductive hormones
Expected changes in reproductive hormones were
observed in all subjects. Serum estradiol was universally
suppressed to postmenopausal levels (�20 pg/mL) by 2
weeks on GnRHa and sustained throughout the dura-
tion of the study, as reported previously (8). Changes in
LH and FSH were consistent with an expected initial
agonist effect followed by desensitization and suppres-
sion of gonadotropins.
Impact of ovarian suppression on HFs
Twenty (69%) subjects reported developing HFs, be-
ginning after 11.1 � 5.5 days on leuprolide. The median
number of HFs reported was 3.8 (interquartile range
[IQR], 2.1–7.5) each night and 3.6 (IQR, 2.3–16.8) each
day. Although the numbers of nighttime and daytime HFs
were correlated (rs � 0.74; P � .001), the proportion of
HFs occurring during the night vs day varied, with some
womenreportingthemajorityduringthedaytimeandoth-
ers a disproportionate number at night. The median num-
ber of objectively measured HFs per night was 3 (IQR,
1.5–4.0).
Change in sleep parameters
Administration of GnRHa resulted in variability be-
tween women in the within-subject change in sleep pa-

 rameters (Table 2), reflecting an adverse effect of the
ovarian suppression on objective and subjective sleep pa-
rameters among some but not all study subjects. For ex-
ample, after treatment, the within-subject change in PSG-
defined WASO ranged from an additional 140.3 minutes
to 22.8 fewer minutes spent awake. The number of sub-
jectively reported nighttime HFs correlated with increases
in sleep fragmentation on the PSG, indicated by the num-
ber of non-REM arousals and transitions per hour of sleep
to wake and to stage N1 (all rs � 0.37; P � .04).
Impact of sleep and HFs on depressive symptoms
Univariate analyses revealed that the number of night-
time HFs reported was associated with an increase in de-
pressive symptoms proportionate to the number of night-
time HFs reported (P � .006) (Table 3 and Figure 1A),
with an increase of 3.2 points (95% CI, 1.0–5.4) on the
MADRS from before to after GnRHa for every additional
nighttimeHFreported.Incontrast,thenumberofdaytime
HFs reported was not associated with a change in mood
(P � .28) (Table 3 and Figure 1B), nor were objectively
measured nighttime HFs (P � .11) or demographic char-
acteristics. Results were consistent when parallel analyses
were run using the MADRS subscore without the sleep
item or the total BDI score as the dependent measure re-
gardless of whether the HF predictor was reported sub-
jectively at night (P � .02, P � .02), measured objectively
at night (P � .09, P � .07), or subjectively during the
daytime (P � .48, P � .44).
In univariate analyses, PSG measures associated (P �
.10) with an increase in depressive symptoms on the
MADRS (Table 3) included a reduction in sleep efficiency
and an increase in stage N1 percentage, the number of
arousalsduringnon-REMsleep,andtherateoftransitions
to wake and to stage N1. Increased MADRS scores were

 also associated with subjective sleep measures of increased
WASO time, sleep-onset latency, and PSQI scores and a
reduction in sleep efficiency (Table 3; P � .10). Results
were consistent in parallel analyses when the dependent
measure was either change in the MADRS score without
the sleep item or change in the BDI score. Both an increase
in PSG-measured WASO and a decrease in PSG-measured
sleep efficiency were associated with an increase in the
MADRS score without the sleep item (P � .001) and the
BDI (P � .002), respectively.
In bivariate analyses (Table 3), the number of nighttime
HFs reported remained significantly associated (P � .05)
with mood deterioration in models adjusted for changes in
objectively measured sleep efficiency, the proportion of
time spent in stage N1, the number of non-REM arousals,
and the number of transitions per hour to wake or stage
N1. Nighttime HF frequency similarly remained a signif-
icant predictor (P � .03) of depressive symptom worsen-
ing after adjusting for changes in self-reported sleep effi-
ciency, WASO time, sleep-onset latency, and PSQI scores.

(Figure2C;P�.04),andworseningofPSQIscores(Figure
2D; P � .02) remained significant predictors of mood
worsening. Objectively measured nighttime HFs and
other sleep variables were no longer associated with
changes in mood in bivariate models adjusting simultane-
ously for subjectively or objectively measured nighttime
HFs and each of the sleep parameters. In parallel analyses
adjusted for PSG-measured WASO or sleep efficiency,
subjectively reported nighttime HFs remained associated
with the change in the MADRS subscore without the sleep
item (P � .048) and marginally as-
sociated with the change in the BDI
score (P � .057).
Discussion
Results of this experimental model
show that mild depressive symptoms
emerge in the context of estradiol
withdrawal proportionate to the
number of nighttime HFs that are
subjectively perceived and to the ex-
tent of objective and perceived sleep
disruption. These findings indicate
that there is an independent associ-
ation of perceived nighttime HFs
with mood disturbance, suggesting
thatdisturbedsleepdoesnotfullyex-
plain the association of nighttime HFs with mood distur-
bance in women undergoing surgical or natural meno-
pause. Results were consistent when the BDI was used to
measure depressive symptoms and when the sleep item
was removed from the MADRS score. Our results also
indicate that the number of daytime HFs and the number
of objectively detected nighttime HFs are not associated
with depressive symptoms, suggesting that the perception
of daytime symptoms and physiological changes accom-
panying nighttime HFs do not correlate with mood dis-
turbance in these women. Taken together, these observa-
tions highlight the importance of both sleep disruption
and perceived nighttime HFs in the emergence of affective
symptoms in estrogen-deprived women.
Epidemiological studies show that subthreshold de-
pressive symptoms are much more common than major
depressive episodes during the menopause transition and
early postmenopause (1, 2). The development of sub-
threshold depressive symptoms in a subgroup of women
was observed in both our study and prior leuprolide stud-
ies (33), whereas clinically significant depressive symp-
toms were induced rarely (n � 1; 3%). Importantly, our
findings indicate that specific menopause-related factors
are associated with the emergence of depressive symptoms
when ovarian steroids are suppressed, reflecting a heter-
ogeneous effect of estradiol withdrawal on mood, similar
to the variable response to estrogen withdrawal observed
in both natural and surgical menopause (1).
We had hypothesized that sleep disruption alone would
explain the widely observed association between HFs and
mild mood disturbance in surgical and natural menopause
(4, 10–12, 14). However, we observed a strong indepen-
dent effect of subjectively reported nighttime HFs on the
development of depressive symptoms. Because objectively

 measured nighttime HFs were not linked with mood
changes, our data suggest that the extent of alertness
and/or awakening for long enough to consciously experi-
ence and recall these nocturnal symptoms may be integral
to this observation. For an objectively measured HF to be
reported, an awakening must be long enough for memory
to be consolidated. Because not all HFs are linked with an
awakening and the duration of a wake episode occurring
in association with a nocturnal HF varies widely (34),
recall for nocturnal HFs is expected to vary. However, it
is also plausible that nighttime HFs are linked with mood
disturbance because those who develop depressive symp-
toms tend to be more likely to recall and report nighttime
HFs. Because increases in sleep fragmentation and time
spent in light sleep were independently associated with
depressive symptoms, women whose sleep was more dis-
rupted by ovarian suppression may have greater aware-
ness of and memory for nighttime HFs. An alternate in-
terpretation is that those with worsening of sleep may be
more likely to attribute their sleep interruption to HF
events. Mechanisms underlying the association between
sleep disruption and mood distur-
bance are poorly understood but
may involve perturbation of immune
function (35), circadian temperature
decline (36), or the sympathetic ner-
vous system (37).
In contrast to the number of per-
ceived nighttime HFs, we found that
the number of daytime HFs reported
was not linked with the emergence of
depressivesymptoms.Toourknowl-
edge, daytime and nighttime HFs
have not been analyzed separately in
prior studies of menopause-associ-
ated mood disturbance. Our study
results may be reflected by the extent
to which women with HFs are both-
ered by and seek treatment for asso-
ciated sleep disturbance (38) and
highlight the importance of distin-
guishing the time of day when HFs
occur. Successful treatment of mild
mood disturbances may rely less
on improving daytime symptoms,
whereastargetingnighttimeHFsand
sleep disturbance may be central to
improving mood. Previous clinical
trials have in fact shown that depres-
sive symptoms in peri-/postmeno-
pausal women are improved in con-
cert with a reduction of insomnia
and subjectively reported nighttime,
but not daytime, HFs (39). In contrast, suppression of HFs
doesnotcorrelatewithmoodimprovementinthepresence
of a clinical depression disorder (40). Such studies, how-
ever, have not distinguished daytime from nighttime HFs.
Moreover, HFs are strongly associated with subsyndro-
mal depressive symptoms (4, 10–12, 14), whereas HFs are
rarely linked with major depression episodes in midlife
women (9).
Our experimental ovarian suppression approach has
important advantages over a naturalistic study in several
respects. Depressive symptoms, HFs, and sleep parame-
ters are examined before and after GnRHa and within-
person changes are calculated. Induced hypoestrogenism
allows the impact of the commonly covarying symptoms
of HFs and sleep disturbance on mood to be disentangled
from that of fluctuating estradiol levels. Furthermore,
confounding effects of age-related sleep changes are
eliminated, permitting sleep changes related to estrogen
withdrawal and HFs to be isolated. Perhaps because
age-related sleep changes were not present, our study
population had a better sleep profile than that observed

treatment as measured by within-subject change in MADRS score in relation to changes in the
proportion of time spent in stage N1 (A), the number of non-REM arousals (B), the number of
transitions to wake per hour (C), and sleep quality on the PSQI (D). P values reflect results from
bivariate linear regression models, adjusting for nighttime HF frequency. Box plots show the
distribution of the data within each group from the 25th to 75th percentile, with the median line
and the whiskers representing the winsorized extreme values. Data are presented according to
whether the PSG sleep parameter increased or did not increase after GnRHa therapy (A–C) and
whether PSQI scores increased by � 2 points or less after GnRHa therapy (D).

 in midlife women who also completed ambulatory PSG
studies (41, 42). However, age-related sleep changes
may compound the impact of HF-associated sleep frag-
mentation on mood, resulting in greater susceptibility
to mood changes.
Although our model most closely mimics surgical
menopause in young women undergoing a rapid and
marked estrogen withdrawal and can be readily translated
to women in the late menopause transition and early post-
menopause who have recently become hypoestrogenic,
generalizability to women in the menopause transition
whose estradiol levels fluctuate widely and who become
hypoestrogenic more gradually may be limited. It is im-
portant to note that this study is a model for menopause-
associated subthreshold depressive symptoms rather than
major depressive episodes, which is widely (1, 2), but not
uniformly (43), linked with the menopause transition. In
addition, the magnitude of change in MADRS scores was
small because the study was designed to examine mecha-
nistic pathways rather than to induce significant levels of
depression. The extent of the mood changes we observed
may have been stronger had women with a history of ma-
jor depression been included (17).
The design advantage of this study stems from the quan-
tification of within-person changes, but the study is limited
by the small sample size typical of experimental studies. The
winsorizingtransformationoftheendpointsusedintheanal-
ysis limits the impact of outliers. Finally, this study was lim-
ited to the evaluation of short-term effects of ovarian sup-
pression because of the increased risk of osteoporosis
associated with repeated dosing of GnRHa.
In summary, this experimental investigation of es-
tradiol suppression and induced HFs provides strong
evidence indicating that the development of mild de-
pressive symptoms varies in relation to both the number
of perceived nighttime HFs and the amount of objective
and subjective sleep disruption that develops. These re-
sults suggest that both sleep disruption and perceived
nighttime HFs play a role in the generation of depressive
symptoms related to surgical and natural menopause.
Women reporting nighttime HFs and sleep interruption
should be screened for mood disturbance, and treat-
ment of those with menopause-related depressive symp-
toms should encompass therapies that improve sleep
interruption as well as nocturnal HFs. Future study di-
rections include a focused approach on women with
histories of mood disorders to determine the impact of
these findings on women at particular risk for meno-
pause-related mood disturbance.
