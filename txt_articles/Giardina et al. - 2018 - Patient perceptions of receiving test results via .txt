ABSTRACT
Objective: Online portals provide patients with access to their test results, but it is unknown how patients use
these tools to manage results and what information is available to promote understanding. We conducted a
mixed-methods study to explore patients’ experiences and preferences when accessing their test results via
portals.
Materials and Methods: We conducted 95 interviews (13 semistructured and 82 structured) with adults who
viewed a test result in their portal between April 2015 and September 2016 at 4 large outpatient clinics in Hous-
ton, Texas. Semistructured interviews were coded using content analysis and transformed into quantitative
data and integrated with the structured interview data. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the struc-
tured data.
Results: Nearly two-thirds (63%) did not receive any explanatory information or test result interpretation at the
time they received the result, and 46% conducted online searches for further information about their result.
Patients who received an abnormal result were more likely to experience negative emotions (56% vs 21%;
P ¼ .003) and more likely to call their physician (44% vs 15%; P ¼ .002) compared with those who received nor-
mal results.
Discussion: Study findings suggest that online portals are not currently designed to present test results to
patients in a meaningful way. Patients experienced negative emotions often with abnormal results, but some-
times even with normal results. Simply providing access via portals is insufficient; additional strategies are
needed to help patients interpret and manage their online test results.
Conclusion: Given the absence of national guidance, our findings could help strengthen policy and practice in
this area and inform innovations that promote patient understanding of test results.
Key words: patient portal, health information technology, electronic health record, diagnostic test, laboratory test

 INTRODUCTION
Patients now have increased electronic access to their health informa-
tion via portals.1,2 Much of this was stimulated by the implementa-
tion of national policies prioritizing patient access and growing
patient demand by patients for access to their health information.3,4
This access, in line with basic tenets of patient-centered care, could
lead to better patient engagement and greater involvement in medical
decision-making.5–8 Initiatives such as OpenNotes have increased
transparency by providing access to clinical notes, resulting in better
patient understanding of health status and enhanced patient-clinician
relationship.9 However, little is known about patients’ understanding
of results received via the patient portal, and merely having access
may not guarantee that patients know how to use the information.10
There is thus an emerging need to identify patients’ needs and prefer-
ences when viewing their test results to ensure that information is
meaningful, useful, and actionable for patients.11–14
Access to test results is an area of high interest to patients,8 and
among the many portal functionalities, patients frequently cite it as
most useful.11,15 Access to results provides an opportunity to foster
patient involvement in care by preventing test results from being
overlooked, a common patient safety concern.16 Further, portals
that allow patients independent and unrestricted access may also
help coordinate care among multiple physicians and avoid redun-
dancy.2,17–19
Literature on patient access to test results through patient portal
is sparse but growing. Prior studies have found that very few
patients experienced negative emotions when viewing their test
results on a portal.11,20,21 However, patients had trouble identifying
when values are out of range in standard test result tables, especially
patients with lower literacy and numeracy.12,14 It is not clear that
patients are always able to interpret the meaning of their test
results.12,21,22 This could, in part, be due to the test result report for-
mat and interface design, such as tables that are formatted for clini-
cian interpretation.14,19 Creative visual displays could be used
instead to increase patients’ understanding of test results.10
Currently there are no national test result notification and inter-
face design standards or guidelines for patient portals.3 Many portals
may only provide test result values with a range or flag to indicate sig-
nificance, similar to the format received by clinicians. Patient portals
lack interoperability and consistency in features and design across pro-
viders, which can frustrate patients and limit their use – only 15%–
30% of patients electronically access their health information.2,8 To
inform future work and development of standards in this area, we con-
ducted a mixed-methods study to explore patients’ experiences and
preferences when accessing their test results via online portals.
METHODS
Study setting and population
We used multiple methods to recruit eligible participants (adults 18
years or older who viewed a test result in their portal) at 4 settings:
an academically affiliated private general practice (n ¼ 24), a pri-
mary care community clinic (n ¼ 1), a network of private-practice
physicians (n ¼ 21), and an urban Veterans Affairs (VA) facility
(n ¼ 49). Three sites used MyChart from Epic Systems (Verona, WI,
USA), a leading commercial provider of electronic health records
(EHRs) in the United States, and the VA site used MyHeatlheVet.
Together, users of the VA’s Computerized Patient Record System
(CPRS) and Epic provide care for about 190 million patients in the
United States.23
We posted flyers at each site, and a research coordinator received
permission to approach patients at 2 of the clinics. At one clinic, 3
physicians assisted with recruitment by handing out flyers to
patients when the research coordinator was onsite. Finally, to boost
sample size, we obtained a list of all portal users at one site and sent
recruitment letters to a random sample of patients. The local institu-
tional review board at each site approved this study.
Design
We used an exploratory mixed-methods design24 to explore the pa-
tient experience of receiving test results through the portal. We ini-
tially conducted 13 semistructured interviews recruited in person or
with flyers in clinic waiting rooms.25 We asked participants to walk
through the process of receiving a test result via the portal and
probed them with questions about their understanding of the results,
information needs, and emotional responses. These questions in-
cluded: What does the test result mean? Did your physician talk to
you about why the test was being done? Did you have any concerns
when you checked the result in the portal? Interviews were con-
ducted in person and by telephone, audio recorded, and transcribed
verbatim. Based on our interview data and discussions with health
information technology experts, we created a final structured inter-
view. Structured interviews were conducted by telephone and in per-
son at the clinics in a private room, and were not audio recorded.
All participants were provided with a $25 gift card for their time.
Data collection
Data collection occurred between April 2015 and September 2016.
To determine eligibility, we first asked potential respondents
whether they had received a recent test result via their patient portal.
If they responded with a yes, we asked whether it was normal or ab-
normal. Before the interview, respondents were asked to think about
that test result and answer the questions based on that experience.
Participants were approached in clinic waiting rooms, were in-
formed of the study by their physician, or responded to posted
flyers. This allowed us to recruit 43 participants. At one site, we
obtained a list of all active portal users and selected a random sam-
ple of 450 users. We sent a recruitment letter with opt-out instruc-
tions and followed up by telephone 2 weeks later. Thirty-nine
additional patients recruited this way agreed to participate. In total,
82 patients participated in structured interviews.
The structured interview assessed 4 domain areas: (1) participant
characteristics, (2) physician and patient actions on test results, (3)
patient perceptions of receiving results via the portal, and (4) portal
concerns and suggestions for improvement. Participant characteris-
tics we assessed included gender, age, race/ethnicity, chronic
conditions, comfort with using the Internet, portal use frequency, a
10-item version of the Patient Activation Measure (PAM),26 and
length of time as a portal user. Physician actions included whether
the physician communicated a reason for the test, called to report
the result, told the patient to check the portal, and explained the re-
sult in the portal. Patient actions included whether or not partici-
pants conducted online research, sent secure messages, called the
physician following receipt of the result, and discussed the result
with family/friends. Patient perceptions included how the patient
knew the result was normal or abnormal, whether the test had been
done before, why it was ordered, expectations about the result,
whether the patient understood the result, and feelings upon seeing
the result. We also included 3 open-ended questions to allow

 participants to discuss problems they experienced receiving test
results via the portal and suggestions for improvement.
Data analysis
Two authors (TG and JB) coded the qualitative data independently us-
ing content analysis to identify emergent categories. Interviews
(n¼ 13) were also transformed into quantitative data and included in
the quantitative analysis. We reviewed the transcripts to identify
instances where the structured interview question content was dis-
cussed. For instance, in the interviews we asked participants to discuss
the first thing they remembered doing after seeing the result in the por-
tal. If the participant said, “I called my doctor,” we would convert
that to nominal data, 1 for yes, under “Did you contact your physi-
cian’s office?” If a participant did not mention contacting the doctor
or was not specifically asked that question, we quantified that as miss-
ing data. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the structured
interview data. Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables
(2-tailed) and independent t-tests for continuous variables using SAS.
RESULTS
We conducted 95 interviews (13 semistructured and 82 structured).
Table 1 shows participant characteristics, which included 55.8%
male, 65.3% white, average age 54.6 years (SD 15.6 years), and
62.1% with 1 or more chronic conditions. Almost three-fourths
(71.6%) had been using the portal for 1 year or more, and 84.2%
considered themselves comfortable with using the Internet. A major-
ity of patients (85.3%) scored high on the PAM in levels 3 and 4,
suggesting that overall they were more activated. Patients indicated
that they underwent a variety of tests, including “annual blood
work,” cholesterol, A1c, tumor-specific antigen, prostate-specific
antigen, liver, kidney, Pap smear, urine analysis, electrocardiogram,
and
thyroid.
While
a
majority
of
patients
simply
listed
“bloodwork,” those who listed a specific test did not indicate its ra-
tionale or whether it was done for screening or diagnostic purposes.
Table 2 shows physician and patient actions before and after re-
ceiving a test result via the patient portal. Most patients (89.5%) in-
dicated that their physician explained why the test was being
ordered. Half (50.5%) reported that their physician told them to
check their portal for the result. However, 63.2% of the participants
reported that their physician did not include a note or interpretation
explaining the result.
We found that participants who received an abnormal result
were more likely to call their physician than those who received a
normal result (44.2 and 15.4%, respectively, P ¼ .002). Overall, a
quarter of participants (25.3%) sent a secure message to their doctor
regarding the test result, more commonly for participants with ab-

 normal (32.6%) than normal (19.2%) test results. Participants who
sent a secure message reported that they did so for further explana-
tion of the test result or to determine next steps. “If I don’t [under-
stand], if I see that something’s out, I can sit down and. . .e-mail my
doctor and ask him to explain it.” (P 1001)
About half of all participants sought information about their
result from sources other than their physician – 46.3% did online
research and 51.6% discussed their result with friends or family.
Participants explained that they conducted online research before
or in addition to contacting their physician to look up unfamiliar
terms or tests they encountered while viewing results, to look up
potential diagnoses, and to avoid bothering their physician. “I’ll
sit down and google it and see if I can figure it out that way before
I bother [doctor name].. . . Those doctors are swamped.” (P 1001)
“If there’s a certain condition that is referenced by a certain test, I
might. . .just google it as a start. . .and learn more about whatever
the condition is.” (P 1003) One participant indicated that the
physician had included a “well explained” note but she still
searched online for additional information, “I googled it and then
clicked on some of the researchy [sic] stuff.. . . NIH has a little
write-up on heart diseases, like a little pamphlet, which explains
what to do.” (P 2004)
Table 3 shows patient perceptions related to receiving test
results. A majority of participants indicated that they knew why the
test was being ordered (95.8%) and had the test done before
(84.2%), and 77.9% stated that they understood their result. In
interviews, understanding the result meant different things. Some
participants were able to discuss the meaning of the test: “This
means that, for instance, with the cholesterol, that I have elevated
indicators that can increase the risk of heart problems, strokes, and
that I should just really watch them and to reduce them” (P1006);
while others understood the results in terms of behavioral changes:
“Basically. . .I would likely have to go on medication and change my
diet at that point.” (P 2004)
When asked about result expectations, patients with normal
results were more likely to expect a normal outcome than those with
abnormal results (80.8 and 53.5%, respectively, P ¼ .0002). Partici-
pants indicated that they knew their result was normal or abnormal
because they noticed a visual cue such as a flagged or bolded value
(61.1%), a physician told them (16.8%), or they had personal medi-
cal knowledge (8.4%), and 8.4% did not know or looked up the test
online.
Over half of participants with abnormal results (55.8%) experi-
enced negative emotions, including confusion, concern, anxiety,
fear, or frustration, when viewing the result. In interviews, partici-
pants expressed nuanced emotions related to their current health
status, personal experiences, and uncertainty. Some participants
with chronic conditions managed their expectations about their test
results based on experience. “Well, I mean, I’ve been taking these
blood tests for years and years and years.. . . There really wasn’t any-
thing unexpected.” (P1005)
Other participants indicated that their anxiety and concern were
related to the perceived new consequences of the test result. One in-
dicated that while over time she has learned what her results mean,
she still experiences anxiety about how it will impact her health. “So
the first time it came back. . .I was a little bit concerned, but after-
wards I kind of really learned to expect that. And with my choles-
terol, I was a bit nervous. . .afraid that the doctor’s going to put me

 on some medications.” (P 1006) Another participant echoed this
anxiety and needed reassurance from her doctor:
The initial [test], that was the only one where I was anxious
and. . .I don’t want to say scared, but I was really concerned
about what it could mean with kidney failure.. . . I think the sec-
ond abnormal one I would’ve liked her to call, because it was
more of a confirmation that “Oh that first one really was abnor-
mal. It wasn’t just a fluke in the lab.” (P 2003)
While in both cases the participants understood their result, it was
not clear what it meant for their future health, and they anticipated
uncertain and potentially uncomfortable changes.
Almost a quarter of participants who received normal results
(21.2%) also experienced negative emotions. One participant
expressed concern because she was unsure how to interpret a posi-
tive test result:
I think some of them said negative and positive. But then I think
for some of the tests that you’re supposed to be positive for an
antibody. So if it says positive on it, you think positive means like
bad, right?. . . It said positive and I freaked and then I went to
talk to my doctor about it. (P 2005)
Half of the participants with normal results (50.0%) expressed in-
difference and indicated that they had existing personal medical
knowledge about the test, a physician or nurse had called prior to
viewing online results, or a normal result was simply not a concern.
Table 4 shows the number of patients reporting problems while
interacting with the portal. More than half of participants (60.0%)
indicated that they did not have trouble checking their test results on
the portal. Patients commented on the time it took for results to post
on the portal, display and usability issues, password issues, and lack
of test result explanations and education. About half (52.6%)
agreed that portals could be improved. Suggestions to improve por-
tals included: improve the display and usability (eg, “Not good for
computer ‘un-savvy’ vets, requires you to go through a maze.
A SEARCH feature would be VERY helpful”), include timely test re-
sult notification with an explanation and follow-up instructions (eg,
“An explanation of the reference range and what the result might
mean to me”), and provide additional functionality (eg, “CT/MRI/
imaging results on portal”).
DISCUSSION
While 94% of hospitals and 77% of health care providers routinely
offer access to laboratory results, less than one-third of patients ac-
cess this information.2,8 We conducted this study to better under-

 stand patients’ experiences accessing their test results through a pa-
tient portal. We found that more than half of the participants did
not receive explanatory information or result interpretation in the
portal at the time they received the result, and almost half conducted
online searches about their result. While more than half of the par-
ticipants did not call their physician following receipt of the result,
participants who received abnormal results were more likely to call
their physician than those who received normal results. Finally, par-
ticipants who received an abnormal result were more likely to expe-
rience negative emotions than those who received a normal result.
Despite increased access to patient portals, there are no nation-
ally recommended practices or guidance for test result notification
via portals. Previous work shows that both patients and physicians
see benefit in providing patients with an interpretation,11,22 but little
progress has been made to facilitate this. The typical table format
may make it harder for patients to distinguish between results that
are slightly out of normal range and clinically relevant findings.10
Only a third of participants received a note in their portal explaining
the test result. Although three-fourths of participants indicated that
they understood their test result, almost half reported searching on-
line for additional information – sometimes before contacting their
physician, in line with previous work.22
Our work has several implications for policy and practice. Under-
standing test results is hard for most patients.12 Providing an interpre-
tation along with the test result at the time of portal release should be
considered best practice.12 Additionally, providing information about
the test at the time of the order does not appear to mitigate patient on-
line research. Several participants searched online for supplemental in-
formation even when they indicated they understood the result.
Rather than discouraging patients from conducting online searches,
they should be encouraged to use specific vetted websites and search
options provided within the portal. The portal should provide easy ac-
cess to such high-quality tools to support and educate patients.21,27,28
While previous literature on patient access to health information has
shown reduced or no effect on anxiety,21,29 our participants experienced
negative emotions when accessing their test results online. Surprisingly,
this occurred with both abnormal and normal test results and included
feeling concerned, confused, anxious, scared, and/or frustrated. Our
findings suggest that some patients will likely experience uncertainty
about their results regardless of the significance, underscoring the need
for additional tools and resources to support them. Although the portal
gives patients access to their health information, it might not be able to
provide them with the appropriate information within the context of
their health problems. Some patients might need additional personalized
or contextual information, compassion, or reassurance – something cur-
rent health information technology cannot provide. For instance, almost
half the participants in our abnormal test results sample called their
physician’s office, and about a third sent a secure message about the ab-
normal test result. Some tests results, especially sensitive results, may re-
quire additional support services or resources for patients. Patient
navigators have been successful at reducing anxiety for patients who re-
ceive an abnormal mammography and are waiting for follow-up test-
ing.30 Thus, ideal test result notification via portals should include
information about the purpose of the test, the result in the context of the
patient’s health, directions for next steps, and specific resources, includ-
ing available support and educational services.18,22,31 Current health
policies should support these strategies.
Based on our findings, we highlight key recommendations for
improving the design and use of patient portals (Table 5). We
mapped these recommendations to an 8-dimension sociotechnical
model that we have found useful in our prior work.32 Briefly, this
model posits that design, development, implementation, and use of
various health information technology applications should be con-
sidered in the context of the larger complex adaptive health care sys-
tem
within
which
the
technology
is
embedded.
To
make
improvements, one needs to consider changes in multiple, and some-
times all, dimensions of the model.
Our study has several limitations. First, we experienced challenges
in recruiting eligible patients despite including 4 clinical settings. Con-
sequently, we used multiple methods to bolster enrollment. At all our
sites, we found that semistructured interviews took longer and were
perceived as burdensome to patients. To boost sample size and re-
cruitment, we used a shorter structured interview guide based on our
semistructured interview data. While we made efforts to focus on just
one test while conducting the interviews, some of our respondents
had multiple chronic conditions and may have discussed multiple
tests. We were not able to control for heterogeneity within subjects.
Additionally, during recruitment we found that while many patients
had signed up for and set up a portal account, they had never logged
in to their account beyond set-up to view a test result. Finally, our
results may not generalize to all types of patients. Our sample con-
sisted of a large majority of patients who reported being comfortable

Dimension
Recommendations
Hardware and software
Ensure that the portal is available on both large-format computers and hand-held devices. Enable search func-
tionality of the site.
Clinical content
Provide easy access to high-quality educational websites.
Human-computer interface
Provide users with access to an explanation of test results directly from results screen.
People
Ensure that patients have direct, easy access to “human” support services that include people, such as patient
navigators, advocates, social workers, or others who work in related educational services.
Workflow and communication
Provide personalized or contextual information to help patients know what to do in light of the results (eg,
make lifestyle changes, send secure messages to their providers, or make follow-up appointments).
Internal organizational policies,
procedures, environment
Develop local policies and procedures to create standardized language guiding patients to a specific follow-up
contact for any questions. Provide patients with educational content on portal-related support when they are
having face-to-face visits.
External rules and regulations
Create national consensus and standards on timing and best practices for portal release of normal and abnormal
test results, especially those with sensitive results (eg, HIV status or cancer diagnosis), and on proxy portal ac-
cess, such as for older relatives.
Measurement and monitoring
Create mechanisms to evaluate patients’ experiences related to test result notification in portals and use this
data to help developers improve portal usability and design innovations to promote patient understanding.

 with the Internet and predominantly scored on the higher levels of
PAM: level 3, taking action, or level 4, maintaining behaviors.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that current patient portals
are not designed to present information on test results in a meaning-
ful
way.
Patients
experienced
negative
emotions
often
with
abnormal
results,
but
sometimes
even
with
normal
results.
While providing patients with access to their test results via portals
is a good start, it is insufficient by itself to meet their needs. To facil-
itate patient engagement, this step should be accompanied by strate-
gies to help patients interpret and manage their test results. Given
the absence of national guidance, findings from this study could be
useful for strengthening policy and practice in this area and inform
innovations that promote patient understanding of test results.
