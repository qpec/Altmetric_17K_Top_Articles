BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and chronic liver disease (CLD) are major causes of morbidity and mortality among
Hispanics. Disparities in the incidence of HCC and in CLD deaths by nativity in Hispanics have been reported. Whether individual-level
risk factors could explain these disparities was assessed in a prospective study of 36,864 Hispanics (18,485 US-born and 18,379
foreign-born) in the Multiethnic Cohort. METHODS: Risk factors were assessed with a baseline questionnaire and Medicare claim files.
During a 19.6-year follow-up, 189 incident cases of HCC and 298 CLD deaths were identified. RESULTS: The HCC incidence rate was
almost twice as high for US-born Hispanic men versus foreign-born Hispanic men (44.7 vs 23.1), but the rates were comparable for
women (14.5 vs 13.4). The CLD mortality rate was about twice as high for US-born Hispanics versus foreign-born Hispanics (66.3 vs
35.1 for men and 42.2 vs 19.7 for women). Heavy alcohol consumption was associated with HCC and CLD in foreign-born individuals,
whereas the current smoking status, hepatitis B/C viral infection, and diabetes were associated with both HCC and CLD. After adjust-
ments for these risk factors, the hazard rate ratios for HCC and CLD death were 1.58 (95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.51) and 1.85
(95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.73), respectively, for US-born Hispanics versus foreign-born Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: US-born
Hispanics, particularly males, are at greater risk for HCC and death from CLD than foreign-born Hispanics. Overall known differences
in risk factors do not account for these disparities. Future studies are warranted to identify factors that contribute to the elevated
risk of HCC development and CLD death in US-born Hispanics. Cancer 2016;122:1444-52. V

INTRODUCTION
The Hispanic and Latino (Hispanic) population is the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States.1
Although the rates of most cancers in Hispanic populations are declining, the rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
the most common type of liver cancer, is increasing.2 During 2006-2010, among individuals aged 50 to 64 years, His-
panics experienced higher HCC incidence and mortality rates than Asians and non-Hispanic whites.3 The incidence of
HCC among Hispanics in California is among the top 3 in the United States.4 HCC is one of the most fatal cancers; the
5-year survival rate among Hispanics is 19% for both men and women.5 Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a major cause of
morbidity and mortality for Hispanics.1,6 Compared with whites, Hispanics have a 50% greater CLD death rate.1 In
2009, CLD was the third leading cause of death for Hispanic men aged 55 to 64 years.7 In the Multiethnic Cohort Study
(MEC), we have observed that Hispanics have the highest rates of HCC incidence and CLD death across 5 ethnic
groups.8,9
Nativity (country of birth) has been suggested to play an important role in Hispanic health.10 A disparity in HCC
incidence by nativity in Hispanic populations has been reported.11,12 Compared with whites and foreign-born Hispanics,
US-born Hispanics have a much higher risk of developing HCC.11 Very few studies, however, have examined the extent
to which detailed individual risk factor data, such as obesity, diabetes, alcohol consumption, smoking, and hepatitis B
virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, account for the observed disparity. In this study, we examined
whether the risk of incident HCC and CLD mortality differed by birth place among Hispanics in the MEC and whether
known risk factors could account for the differences.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The details of the MEC and the baseline characteristics
have been published.13 Briefly, the MEC is an ongoing,
population-based, prospective cohort study with more
than 215,000 men and women from Hawaii and Califor-
nia (mainly Los Angeles County) assembled between
1993 and 1996. Potential participants, aged 45 to 75 years
at recruitment, were identified primarily through Depart-
ment of Motor Vehicles driver licenses, voter registration
lists, and Health Care Financing Administration data
files. All participants returned a self-administered baseline
questionnaire that sought information about the follow-
ing: demographic and anthropometric measures; personal
history of medical conditions; family history of cancer;
and lifestyle factors, including diet, physical activity,
smoking history, and medication use. The current study
included only the California component because almost
all Hispanics in the cohort are from California.
There were 47,438 Hispanic participants, and we
excluded those with a cancer diagnosis (except for nonme-
lanoma skin cancer) before cohort entry; those with infor-
mation missing for place of birth, education, body mass
index, diabetes, smoking status, or alcohol intake; and
those with invalid dietary data based on macronutrient
intake14 as a marker of quality for the questionnaire. As a
result, data on 36,864 Latino participants (18,485
US-born and 18,379 foreign-born) were available for the
current analysis. The institutional review boards at the
University of Hawaii and the University of Southern
California approved the study protocol.
Endpoint Assessment
Incident HCC cases (International Classification of Dis-
eases for Oncology [version 3] topographic code C22.0 and
morphology codes 8170-8175) were identified through
annual linkage to the Cancer Surveillance Program for
Los Angeles County and the California State Cancer
Registry, which are part of the National Cancer Institute’s
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program.
CLD deaths (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, 571; International Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision, K70-K76) were determined through an-
nual linkage to state death certificate files in California
and periodic linkage to the National Death Index. The
majority of CLD deaths in the MEC were listed as
alcohol-related disease (48.7%) or fibrosis/cirrhosis of the
liver (38.9%). Participants who died of HCC were not
included in the CLD mortality count because the incident
cases had already been counted. Deaths from other liver
cancers were also not included because they were often
due to metastasis from another cancer site rather than pri-
mary HCC. The endpoint ascertainment was complete
through December 31, 2013.
Exposure Ascertainment
Data on demographic factors (eg, education, place of
birth, and years of living in the United States), medical
history, and lifestyle and dietary factors, including smok-
ing history, alcohol consumption, and vigorous physical
activity, were obtained from the baseline questionnaire.
Dietary information was obtained with a quantitative
food frequency questionnaire (QFFQ) designed for use in
this multiethnic population.13 A calibration study of the
QFFQ was conducted with three 24-hour recalls in a ran-
dom subsample of participants selected within sex-racial/
ethnic groups, and it revealed a high correlation between
the QFFQ and 24-hour recalls for energy-adjusted
nutrients.15 Self-reported body weight and height were
used to calculate the body mass index (kg/m2). The HBV
and HCV infection status was obtained with International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes (HBV,
070.20-23, 070.30-33, and V02.61; HCV, 070.41,
070.44, 070.51, 070.54, 070.70, 070.71, and V02.62) in
Medicare claim files for the MEC fee-for-service partici-
pants (n 5 17,205).16 Because the prevalence of HBV
infection was low (<1%) in our Hispanic populations, we
combined it with the HCV status. The characteristics of
fee-for-service participants are shown in Table 1; their
characteristics were similar to those of the whole cohort
(Table 2).
Statistical Analysis
Nativity was categorized as US-born or foreign-born.
Hazard rate ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for HCC incidence and CLD deaths associated with
nativity were calculated with Cox proportional hazards
models. Age (in days) was used as the underlying time
variable in the Cox regression, which started with a partic-
ipant’s age at entry (baseline questionnaire completion)
and ended with the earliest of these endpoints: date of
HCC diagnosis, date of death (due to CLD or other
causes for noncases), or end of follow-up (December 31,
2013). Cox models were adjusted for the level of educa-
tion (high school graduate or less, some college, or college
graduate or more), body mass index (<25, 25 to <30, or
�30 kg/m2), self-reported, physician-diagnosed type 2
diabetes (yes or no), cigarette smoking status (never, for-
mer, or current), and alcohol intake (0, <24, or �24 g of
ethanol/d; �24 g of ethanol/d was equivalent to �2

 drinks per day). Vigorous physical activity was categorized
as none, �20 min/d, or >20 min/d. Dietary factors (eg,
red meat, vegetable, and fruit intake) were categorized
with overall tertile distributions in the cohort. We also
further adjusted for the HBV/HCV infection status in the
Medicare fee-for-service population subset. The propor-
tional hazards assumption was tested with an assessment
of the Schoenfeld residuals, and no major violation was
observed. We performed tests for trends by entering the
ordinal values representing categories of exposure as con-
tinuous variables in the models. All P values are 2-sided.
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.2 software
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of Hispanic MEC participants
by nativity are shown in Table 2. Among the foreign-born
participants, the majority were born in Mexico (76.6% of
men and 71.2% of women), and the rest were born in ei-
ther Central or South America (23.4% of men and 28.8%
of women). The age at cohort entry was slightly higher
among US-born Hispanics versus foreign-born Hispanics.
The majority of foreign-born Hispanics had lived in the
United States for 15 years or longer (83.4% of men and
80.8% of women). The education level was higher for
US-born Hispanics versus foreign-born Hispanics. For
both men and women, there was a higher prevalence of

 heavy alcohol drinking, ever smoking, diabetes, and obe-
sity in US-born Hispanics versus foreign-born Hispanics.
The US-born Hispanics consumed lower total amounts of
fruits and vegetables in comparison with the foreign-born
Hispanics (both men and women), whereas the intake of
saturated fat and red meat was similar. The prevalence of
hepatitis infection was higher in US-born men versus
foreign-born men (4.1% vs 2.8%); the rates were more
similar in women (3.0% vs 2.6%).
During a median follow-up of 19.6 years, 189 His-
panics were diagnosed with HCC, and 298 Hispanics
died of CLD. The HCC case and CLD death characteris-
tics along with the HCC incidence and CLD mortality
rates are shown in Table 3. For men and women, the
mean age at HCC diagnosis and the stage of disease were
comparable between US-born and foreign-born His-
panics. The age-adjusted HCC incidence rate was almost
twice as high for US-born Hispanic men versus foreign-
born Hispanic men (44.7 vs 23.1), but the rates were
comparable for US-born and foreign-born Hispanic
women (14.5 vs 13.4). US-born Hispanic men and
women had 89% and 114% higher CLD mortality rates,
respectively, than their foreign-born counterparts. In
men, the majority of CLD deaths were due to alcoholic
liver diseases (60.2% for US-born men and 73.8% for
foreign-born men), whereas in women, the majority of

Disparity in HCC and CLD in US Hispanics/Setiawan et al
Cancer
May 1, 2016
1447
 CLD deaths were due to cirrhosis or fibrosis (55.6% for
US-born women and 64.1% for foreign-born women).
The proportion of alcohol-related CLD deaths among
women was higher for US-born women versus foreign-
born women. The average ages at CLD death were similar
for US-born and foreign-born Hispanics.
The associations of known and potential risk factors
with HCC incidence by nativity are shown in Table 4.
The results were similar for men and women; therefore,
the results are given for men and women combined.
Increasing alcohol consumption was associated with the
risk of HCC in foreign-born Hispanics (P for trend 5
.0148). Compared with nondrinkers, those who con-
sumed �2 drinks per day had a 3-fold increased risk (HR,
2.96; 95% CI, 1.44-6.06). Current smoking was associ-
ated with HCC in US-born Hispanics (HR, 2.91; 95%
CI, 1.75-4.85) and foreign-born Hispanics (HR, 2.10;
95% CI, 1.13-3.90). Diabetes was strongly associated
with HCC, regardless of nativity (HR, �3.3). The body
mass index was associated with HCC in US-born His-
panics (P for trend 5 .0365) and foreign-born Hispanics
(P for trend 5 .0516). Red meat intake was associated
with risk in foreign-born Hispanics. HBV/HCV was
strongly associated with HCC in US-born Hispanics
(HR, 16.13; 95% CI, 8.73-29.81) and foreign-born His-
panics (HR, 19.93; 95% CI, 9.44-42.07). Education lev-
els, vigorous physical activity, saturated fat, and fruit and
vegetable intake were not associated with HCC.
Table 5 shows the associations of known and poten-
tial risk factors with CLD mortality by nativity. Alcohol
consumption (�2 drinks per day), current smoking,
diabetes, and body mass index were significantly associ-
ated with the risk of CLD death in US-born and foreign-
born Hispanics. Increased education (P for trend 5 .006)
and vegetable intake (P for trend 5 .0063) was associated
with a reduced risk of CLD death among US-born His-
panics. HBV/HCV was a strong risk factor for CLD death
in US-born and foreign-born Hispanics. Vigorous physi-
cal activity, saturated fat, and red meat and fruit intake
were not associated with the risk of CLD death in this
population.
The associations between nativity and HCC and
CLD death are shown in Table 6. Results were com-
bined for men and women because the numbers of cases
were limited and the risk factor associations were similar
for men and women. In the age- and sex-adjusted
model, US-born Hispanics had a 61% higher risk of
developing HCC in comparison with foreign-born His-
panics (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.20-2.17). Further adjust-
ments for body mass index, smoking status, alcohol
intake, and diabetes attenuated the HR, but the risk
among
US-born
Hispanics
remained
significantly
higher (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08-1.96). Although the

DISCUSSION
After accounting for known risk factors, we have found
that the risk of developing HCC and the risk of dying of
CLD among Hispanics differ by the place of birth, with

 US-born Hispanics having a 58% higher risk of HCC and
an 85% higher risk of CLD mortality in comparison with
those born in Mexico or South/Central America. The
higher risk of HCC associated with Hispanic nativity was
mainly seen in men.
Our results are consistent with results from previous
HCC studies in Hispanics.11,12 El-Serag et al11 showed
that in 1999-2001, the liver cancer mortality rates among
US-born Hispanic men were more than twice as high as
rates for foreign-born Hispanic men in California and

 65% higher than rates for those in Texas. Using California
Cancer Registry data, Chang et al12 showed similar find-
ings; in 1988-2004, US-born Hispanic men in California
had 86% higher liver cancer incidence rates than foreign-
born Hispanic men. In the MEC, which was based in Cal-
ifornia, we observed 93% higher liver cancer incidence
rates in US-born Hispanic men versus foreign-born His-
panic men. Two other studies showed higher liver cancer
incidence rates among Hispanic men in Florida in com-
parison with the incidence rates in their country of ori-
gin17 and higher liver cancer incidence rates on the US
mainland versus Puerto Rico for men but not for
women.18
Acculturation has been associated with increased
rates of smoking, alcohol drinking, and obesity in His-
panics19-22; in agreement with these population-based
studies, US-born Hispanics in the MEC had higher rates
of smoking, alcohol drinking, and obesity in comparison
with foreign-born Hispanics. It has been suggested that a
greater prevalence of risk factors for HCC (eg, HCV
infection, greater alcohol consumption, and metabolic
syndrome) in the more acculturated US-born Hispanic
population causes the disparity in HCC incidence by na-
tivity.11 The diverging nativity patterns by sex for HCC
might be due to a tendency of male immigrants to adopt
unhealthy lifestyles (eg, excessive alcohol drinking, weight
gain, and illicit drug use) in contrast to females.17 For
Hispanic men and women in the MEC, HBV/HCV
infection and diabetes are the strongest risk factors for
HCC, and the differences in the prevalence of HBV/
HCV (1.4% in men and 0.4% in women) and diabetes
(4.2% in men and 2.4% in women) between US-born
and foreign-born Hispanics are larger for men than
women. Thus, the greater differences in the prevalence of
HBV/HCV infection and diabetes between US-born and
foreign-born Hispanic men and their female counterparts
could be the reason, at least partially, for the observed HCC
incidence difference in men (but not women) between the 2
nativity groups. However, even after accounting for these dif-
ferences and other factors, we found that the risk of HCC
among US-born Hispanics remained significantly higher
than the risk among foreign-born Hispanics.
US-born men and women have much higher rates of
CLD death than their foreign-born counterparts. The
major risk factors for CLD in the MEC Hispanics are ex-
cessive alcohol drinking, diabetes, HBV/HCV, and smok-
ing. The prevalence of excessive drinking and smoking is
higher in US-born women versus foreign-born women,
and this could lead to a much higher rate of CLD death
among US-born women. We also observed a higher pro-
portion of alcohol-related CLD deaths among US-born
women versus foreign-born women. Similarly to HCC,
accounting for risk factors did not explain the excess risk
observed among US-born Hispanics.
Our study has several strengths and weaknesses. The
strengths include its prospective design, long follow-up,
large sample size, and detailed information on most HCC
risk factors. The major limitations include the ascertain-
ment of the HBV/HCV status with Medicare claims
because this was ascertained only if there was a medical
reason for determination and thus this information was
most likely incomplete. Our analysis was based on expo-
sure information collected at the baseline and based on
self-reporting, and thus, exposure misclassification as well
as changes in exposures during follow-up cannot be ruled
out. Even in our relatively large cohort, the number of
cases within risk factor categories by sex and nativity were
small. The limited number of cases might reduce our abil-
ity to observe excess risk in any or many of the specific
subgroups.
In summary, US-born Hispanics are at greater risk
for HCC development and CLD death than their foreign-
born counterparts. Although overall known differences in
risk factors do not account for these observed disparities in
HCC incidence and CLD mortality risk between US-born
and foreign-born Hispanics, we have observed that
HCV/HBV infection, diabetes, excessive alcohol drinking,
and current smoking are important risk factors in this pop-
ulation. To reduce and control the development of HCC

 and death from CLD, public health recommendations
such as the identification and treatment of patients with
chronic infections with HBV or HCV and the prevention
and control of diabetes, in addition to recommendations to
limit alcohol consumption and quit smoking, should be
targeted toward Hispanics, especially those who are born in

the unidentified risk factors that contribute to the elevated
HCC incidence and increased rate of CLD deaths among
US-born Hispanics.
