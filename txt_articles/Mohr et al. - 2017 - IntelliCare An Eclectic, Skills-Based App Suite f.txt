 IntelliCare Coach Dashboard
Our IntelliCare coach dashboard houses the text messaging interface and displays patient engagement with the app suite, including 
which apps are being used and when. The dashboard also includes alerts to support efficient triage and clinical decision-making and 
patients total score on brief symptom questionnaire (PHQ-4). Due to research protocols, this dashboard does not contain content from 
the apps (e.g. data from text fields as displayed below), which would be added in the proposed study.
 IntelliCare Coach Dashboard (continued)
A pop-up window allows coaches to view PHQ-4 responses in more detail and includes individual responses, prior scores, and a 
graphical representation of change over time.
