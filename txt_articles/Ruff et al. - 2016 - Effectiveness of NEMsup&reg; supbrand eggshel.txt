Introduction: Sub-optimal joint function is extremely prevalent in dogs.  Therefore, a 6-week, 
prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at eight differ-
ent veterinary clinics to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NEM® brand eggshell 
membrane (EM), a novel dietary supplement shown in other species to help maintain healthy 
joints and connective tissues. 
Subjects and methods: Fifty-one dogs received oral EM ~13.5 mg/kg (6 mg/lb) or placebo 
(excipients) once daily for 6 weeks.  The primary outcome measure of this study was to evalu-
ate the change in mean joint function following 1 week and 6 weeks of supplementation as 
determined via the Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI) questionnaire (Q#5-10) in the treat-
ment group versus the placebo group.  Secondary outcome measures were for changes in mean 
CBPI pain and CBPI quality of life, and mean joint pain, mobility and lameness via Veterinary 
Canine Scoring Assessments (VCSA).  A final secondary outcome measure was for a change 
in serum levels of the cartilage degradation biomarker, c-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of 
type-II collagen (CTX-II).  
Results:  Supplementation with EM produced a significant treatment response versus placebo 
at 1 week (20.5% improvement, P=0.028), but fell shy of significance at 6 weeks post-treatment 
(22.5% improvement) for the primary outcome measure (CBPI Function), despite a sizeable 
treatment effect.  Similarly, there was also a significant treatment response versus placebo at 1 
week for CBPI Pain (19.4% improvement, P=0.010), but fell just shy of significance at 6 weeks 
(22.5% improvement), again despite a sizeable treatment effect.  Results were not significant 
versus placebo at 1 week for CBPI quality of life (14.0%  
improvement), but produced a sig-
nificant treatment response by the end of the 6-week study (26.8%  
improvement, P=0.033). 
Additionally, EM produced a significant treatment response versus  
placebo at 6 weeks for 
VCSA pain (23.6% improvement, P=0.012), but fell shy of significance for VCSA mobility 
and VCSA lameness (walking & trotting). Serum CTX-II levels in EM-supplemented dogs 
was significantly improved versus placebo at 6 weeks (47.9% improvement, P=0.018).  There 
were no serious adverse events reported during the study and subject dog owners reported 
that EM was well tolerated by their pets.
Conclusion: Supplementation with EM, ~13.5 mg/kg (6 mg/lb) taken once daily, significantly 
reduced joint pain and improved joint function rapidly (CBPI 1 week) and demonstrated a last-
ing improvement in joint pain (VCSA 6 weeks) leading to an improved quality of life (CBPI 6 
weeks).  Moreover, a profound chondroprotective effect was demonstrated following 6 weeks 
of supplementation with EM (CTX-II).

Introduction
Suboptimal joint function (stiffness, inflexibility, and lame-
ness) is extremely prevalent in dogs, often arising from either 
congenital abnormalities or traumatic injury. Hip dysplasia 
is the most common orthopedic condition, leading to sub-
optimal joint function. Estimates of its rate of incidence 
are quite variable throughout the world, with larger studies 
centering around ~20% across all breeds and having a range 
of anywhere from a few percent to ~50% depending upon 
breed.1–4 Joint laxity, femoral head misalignment, and uneven 
weight distribution while walking produce chronic localized 
inflammation in hip dysplasia, frequently leading to the devel-
opment of osteoarthritis (OA) secondarily. Epidemiological 
evidence of the prevalence of primary and/or secondary OA 
in dogs is sparse, but some estimate that up to 20% of adult 
dogs and 80% of geriatric dogs (>8 years old) suffer from 
OA,5,6 which is in line with estimates of the prevalence of 
OA in humans (21%).7
Cartilage is primarily composed of extracellular matrix, 
a composite network of proteins such as type II collagen 
interacting with negatively charged polysaccharides such as 
hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate (CS), all of which 
are synthesized and secreted by chondrocytes. Pathological 
conditions such as OA are characterized by an imbalance in 
cartilage turnover, in which catabolic processes predominate 
over anabolic processes. Extracellular matrix synthesis can-
not keep pace with degradation, resulting in a loss of the 
structural integrity of the articular cartilage. This cartilage 
metabolism imbalance coupled with biomechanical stress 
in the joint resulting from laxity, misalignment, or other 
malformations leads to chronic inflammation and ultimately 
irreversible joint destruction. Products of this cartilage deg-
radation process can be found in both blood and urine of 
arthritic subjects.
Of these cartilage degradation biomarkers, c-terminal 
cross-linked telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) has 
been shown to have a strong correlation with the histologi-
cal severity of destructive joint diseases in animal models.8 
Because CTX-II is highly conserved genetically within 
vertebrate species, it has shown an exceptional correlation 
between animal model research and human clinical evalu-
ation. CTX-II has been associated with both the incidence 
and progression of human OA in multiple clinical trials.9–11 
However, relatively few studies have assessed the utility of 
CTX-II in the evaluation of canine joint disease;12 and to 
our knowledge, CTX-II has never been used to evaluate the 
chondroprotective effect of a treatment for naturally occur-
ring canine joint disease.
The pain and inflammation associated with canine mala-
dies such as hip dysplasia and OA can be quite debilitating, 
and few treatment options exist outside of easing symptoms. 
Traditional nonsurgical treatments for these disorders usu-
ally involve the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs, eg, carprofen, meloxicam, etc).13 However, as in 
humans, there are safety concerns with long-term use of 
NSAIDs. Complementary and alternative medicines such 
as dietary supplements are also sometimes used in the 
management of canine OA,14 although there have been few 
well-controlled trials demonstrating their efficacy in dogs. 
Glucosamine (GluN), chondroitin, and omega-3 fatty acids 
(eg, fish oil, green-lipped mussel, etc) alone and in combina-
tion are widely marketed as canine dietary supplements to 
treat joint pain. The discovery of eggshell membrane (ESM) 
as a natural source of immune-modulating components has 
prompted the evaluation of this material as a treatment for 
suboptimal joint function in dogs.
ESM, found between the calcified shell and the albumin 
in chicken eggs, is primarily composed of fibrous pro-
teins such as collagen type I,15 which form the mesh-like 
structure of the bilayered material. However, ESMs have 
also been shown to contain other bioactive components, 
namely glycosaminoglycans (ie, dermatan sulfate,16 CS,16 
hyaluronic acid,17 etc). ESM is known to reduce the expres-
sion of various proinflammatory cytokines both in vitro18 
and in vivo,19 including the key mediators of inflamma-
tion, interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. A 
proprietary form of ESM, commercially available as the 
branded product NEM® brand eggshell membrane (EM) 
(ESM Technologies LLC, Carthage, MO, USA), has dem-
onstrated safety and efficacy in multiple clinical trials in 
relieving joint pain and stiffness in humans with OA20–22 
and has been investigated for similar uses in various spe-
cies of animals, including cranes,23 camels,24 and horses.25 
However, EM has not been previously evaluated in dogs.
Although it is generally agreed that animals lack a 
significant placebo effect, it can nonetheless be difficult to 
evaluate subjective measures of their health and well-being. 
The Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI) is a validated owner-
administered test instrument (questionnaire) that is designed 
to assess the severity of chronic pain in dogs with OA and 
its impact on their function during daily activities. The CBPI 
has been shown to be appropriate and sufficiently sensitive 
to reliably detect treatment responses in multiple studies.26–29 
In addition to the dog owner’s assessment of treatment effect, 
it is also important to obtain a clinician’s assessment, as a 
veterinarian will generally be more objective regarding the

dog’s condition than will the dog owner. Over the past decade, 
various ordinal-scale clinician assessment tools have been 
developed,  which provide a good basis for the inclusion of 
veterinarian evaluation of study dogs.30–32
The multicenter trial reported herein was designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of the natural joint treatment, 
EM in dogs. Therefore, a 6-week, multicenter, randomized, 
controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and 
tolerability of EM for the treatment of suboptimal joint func-
tion (eg, stiffness, inflexibility, lameness) in dogs.
Subjects and methods
Study design
The study was conducted according to a prospective, ran-
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design and was 
conducted across eight veterinary clinics in the Saint Louis, 
MO metropolitan area. The study design was approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of 
Missouri State University (Springfield, MO USA) (Study #14-
035.0) in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals (National Academies Press, Washington, 
D.C. USA, 1996). Dog owners provided their written informed 
consent for their dogs to participate. Eligible subjects were 
centrally randomized to receive either EM or placebo in the 
order in which they were enrolled in the study using a per-
muted-block randomization table consisting of four subjects 
per block. Dog owners, clinical investigators, subinvestigators, 
clinical site personnel, and the clinical coordinator (performed 
central randomization) were all blinded to treatment. Treat-
ment consisted of tablets (once daily, orally) providing either 
150 mg of EM or 150 mg of additional excipients for every 
25 pounds of a subject dog’s body weight (equating to ~6 mg/
lb or 13.5 mg/kg). This dose was based upon an allometric 
conversion33 from the human dose of 500 mg/d that has been 
shown to be effective in previous clinical trials.20–22 Both 
treatment and placebo tablets were provided by United Pet 
Group, a division of Spectrum Brands (Earth City, MO, USA), 
and were identical in appearance and odor and were stored in 
closed containers at ambient temperature. Inactive excipients 
(ie, brewer’s yeast, maltodextrin, silicon dioxide) were used 
to produce both treatment tablets, and additional excipients 
replaced the EM in the placebo tablets. The placebo tablets 
were tested to verify that they did not contain EM. Clinic 
visits were scheduled for subject dogs at study initiation and at 
6 weeks following the onset of treatment. Subject dog owners 
were given an owner-assessment diary to be filled out daily 
for 6 weeks and were instructed to record any changes in the 
overall subject health, changes in exercise routine, and any 
apparent discomfort associated with ingestion of either treat-
ment or placebo tablets. Treatment compliance was checked 
at the final clinic visit by owner interview and by counting the 
number of unused doses of the study medications.
Subjects
All privately owned dogs, 18 months of age or older, weighing 
10–100 pounds whose owners were seeking relief of mild 
to moderate suboptimal joint function were considered for 
enrollment in the study. In order to be eligible, subject dogs 
must have had mild-to-moderate persistent suboptimal joint 
function (eg, difficulty in getting up from a laying position, 
a noticeable limp, impaired gait, difficulty in climbing stairs) 
lasting for at least 3 months with a mean baseline function 
score between 2.0 and 8.5 on Q#5–10 of the CBPI question-
naire. Dogs that were currently receiving prescription or over-
the-counter analgesic medications or NSAIDs daily were only 
eligible to participate in the study following a 14-day washout 
period for NSAIDs, a 7-day washout period for narcotics, and 
a 90-day washout period for injected steroids. Dogs currently 
receiving joint health supplements or consuming a joint 
health diet (ie, those containing glucosamine, CS, methylsul-
fonylmethane, curcumin, etc) were only eligible to participate 
in the study following a 3-month washout period. Subjects 
were excluded if they were currently receiving remission-
inducing drugs such as methotrexate or immunosuppressive 
medications or had received them within the past 3 months. 
They were also excluded if they had a known confounding 
immune-mediated (eg, lupus), known infectious (eg, Lyme 
disease), known neurological, or known neoplastic disease 
or condition that would interfere with assessment of joint 
function. Other exclusionary criteria were a known allergy to 
eggs or egg products, a significant injury to the affected joint 
within the past 3 months, or pregnant or nursing female dogs. 
Subjects participating in any other research study involving 
an investigational product (drug, device, or biologic) or a 
new application of an approved product, within 30 days of 
screening, were also excluded from participating in the trial.
Treatment response
The primary outcome measure of this study was to evaluate 
the change in mean joint function as determined via CBPI 
questionnaire (Q#5–10) in the treatment group versus the pla-
cebo group. An additional outcome measure was to evaluate 
a change in mean joint pain or discomfort as determined via 
CBPI questionnaire (Q#1–4) in the treatment group versus 
the placebo group. The treatment response end points were 
at 1 week (by in-home owner survey) and at the week 6 clinic

visit utilizing the eleven-question-validated CBPI question-
naire. Each of the first ten questions on the CBPI questionnaire 
includes a zero to ten ordinal scale, with zero equating to no 
pain (or does not interfere) and ten equating to extreme pain 
(or completely interferes). The final CBPI question asks the 
owner to rate the dog’s overall quality of life (QOL) using a 
five-category Likert-type scale (poor/fair/good/very good/
excellent), which was then converted to a numeric value (1–5) 
for statistical comparison. End points were then compared to 
placebo assessments. Additional outcome measures were the 
change in mean joint pain and mobility utilizing a Veterinary 
Canine Scoring Assessment (VCSA) and the change in mean 
lameness while walking (w) and trotting (t) utilizing a second 
VCSA. The joint pain and mobility VCSA consisted of a five-
point ordinal scale assessment via palpation or manipulation 
of the most apparent affected joint or joints (Table 1), and 
the lameness VCSA consisted of a seven-point ordinal scale 
assessment while either walking or trotting (Table 2).
Assessment of serum CTX-II
A secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the change 
in mean serum CTX-II levels in the treatment group versus 
placebo at 6 weeks. Blood samples were collected in serum 
tubes at baseline and at the week 6 clinic visit. In brief, the 
blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 
15–30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 1,000–2,000× 
g for ~10 minutes. Following transfer of the supernatant 
serum to a new tube, samples were stored frozen (-20°C) until 
analysis. Serum concentrations of CTX-II were measured via 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercial 
immunoassay (Serum Pre-Clinical CartiLaps® [CTX-II] EIA; 
Immunodiagnostic Systems, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) 
according to manufacturer’s instructions using a SpectraMax 
Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices LLC, Sunny-
vale, CA, USA). Samples were run in duplicate when assayed.
Adverse events and safety
A final objective of this study was to evaluate safety, tolerabil-
ity, and any adverse reactions associated with  
supplementation 
with EM. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at the 
week 6 clinic visit to evaluate treatment safety via clinical 
chemistry (total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin 
ratio, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen/cre-
atinine ratio, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline 
phosphatase) and hematology (platelet count, hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin count, red blood 
cell count, and white blood cell count with differential

the study protocol. AEs and serious AEs were assessed by 
the clinical investigator at each study visit and followed until 
resolution, as necessary. Serious AEs were required to be 
reported to the study monitor immediately.

Eggshell membrane in dogs
Statistical analysis
As this is the first efficacy trial in dogs, historical data were 
not available to serve as a basis for sample size determination. 
However, the hypothesis for this study is that the treatment 
group will be superior to that of the placebo group in improving 
suboptimal joint function. A 15% absolute change in the mean 
primary treatment response (joint function score will decrease 
by an average of at least 15% in the treatment group versus 
the placebo group) was used for sample size determination. 
Based upon this, it was estimated that a sample size of 40 dogs 
(20 treatment and 20 placebo) would need to be enrolled to 
provide the study with a statistical power of 80% to detect a 
treatment effect difference between the treatment group and 
the placebo group, assuming a rate of response of 20% in the 
treatment group, a rate of response of 5% in the placebo group, 
and a withdrawal rate of 5%. Since the enrollment for the study 
was 51 dogs, this should be sufficient to provide adequate 
safety and comparative effectiveness information. Descriptive 
statistics were calculated, including mean age and weight, and 
comparisons of these demographic data from the eight clini-
cal sites were made with a Kruskal–Wallis test for multiple 
independent samples at baseline to validate randomization. 
Within-group comparisons, using the Kruskal–Wallis test for 
multiple independent samples, were also made within clinical 
sites to rule out any site bias. Post-baseline statistical analyses 
were performed as repeated measures analysis of variance. 
The items found to have statistical significance with repeated 
measures analysis of variance were then compared using a 
Wilcoxon test for dependent samples. In all cases, statistical 
significance was accepted at P<0.05. Analysis of the primary 
end point and all secondary end points was conducted on the 
intent-to-treat population (ie, including all randomized subjects 
with at least one efficacy assessment after randomization). 
The last observation carried forward approach was used for 
subjects that made at least one follow-up visit but that did not 
complete the study (lost to follow-up) to minimize missing 
data points for statistical transformations. SYSTAT software 
(Version 13) was used for all statistical analyses.34
Results
Subject recruitment began in August 2014 at eight veterinary 
clinics in the Saint Louis, Missouri metropolitan area, and 
the final evaluation was completed in August 2015. A total 
of 51 dogs between the ages of 3 years and 14 years with 
suboptimal joint function were enrolled in the study and 
underwent randomization. Of these subjects, 12% (6/51) 
were from site 1, 20% (10/51) were from site 2, 12% (6/51) 
were from site 3, 25% (13/51) were from site 4, 10% (5/51) 
were from site 5, 8% (4/51) were from site 6, 10% (5/51) 
were from site 7, 4% (2/51) were from site 8, 21 (41%) were 
female, 30 (59%) were male, and all were either spayed or 
neutered. The treatment joints consisted of stifle/knee (24), 
hip (21), shoulder (3), and elbow (10). Of the 24 subjects 
in which the stifle/knee was the affected joint, six (25%) 
had bilateral incidence. Of the 21 subjects in which the hip 
was the affected joint, eleven (52%) had bilateral incidence. 
Complete subject demographics, subdivided by treatment 
group, are reported in Table 3. Forty-six dogs completed the 
6-week study per the protocol. The dropout rate (9.8%; three 
placebo and two treatment) was moderately higher than the 
estimated dropout rate (5%) used in the sample size deter-
mination; however, enrollment well exceeded the sample 
size of 40 dogs. From each group, two dogs were withdrawn 
due to lack of efficacy, and one dog was withdrawn from 
the placebo group due to not meeting the inclusion criteria. 
Compliance with the study treatment regimen was good in 
both treatment groups.
Subject demographic data were initially evaluated 
to ensure randomization within each site (not shown). 
Additionally, subject data were evaluated between sites to 
exclude site bias (not shown). During the randomization 
evaluation, data from site 1 exhibited some abnormalities, 
and upon further investigation, randomization could not 
be guaranteed so data from these dogs (6) were excluded 
from further evaluation. As there were no abnormalities 
within the remaining sites, the data (45) were pooled 
for all subsequent analyses. A clinical comparison of 
valid subjects (excluding noncompliance) was carried 
out to obtain mean baseline values for each of the CBPI 
outcome measures (Table 4). Statistical analysis of the

primary outcome measure (CBPI function) revealed that 
supplementation with EM produced a significant treatment 
response versus placebo at 1 week (20.5% improvement, 
P=0.028), but fell short of significance at 6 weeks post-
treatment (21.1% improvement, P=0.155), despite a size-
able treatment effect. Similarly, supplementation with EM 
produced a significant treatment response versus placebo at 
1 week for CBPI pain (19.4% improvement, P=0.010), but 
fell just short of significance at 6 weeks (22.5% improve-
ment, P=0.098), again despite a sizeable treatment effect. 
Supplementation with EM was not significant versus 
placebo at 1 week for CBPI QOL (14.0% improvement, 
P=0.155), but produced a significant treatment response 
by the end of the 6-week study (26.8% improvement, 
P=0.033). A clinical comparison of valid subjects (exclud-
ing noncompliance) was also carried out to obtain mean 
baseline values for each of the VCSA outcome measures 
(Table 5). Statistical analysis of the secondary outcome 
measures (VCSA pain, mobility, lameness while walking, 
and lameness while trotting) revealed that supplementation 
with EM produced a significant treatment response versus

Viable serum samples from both baseline and week 6 
were obtained from 26 (14 treatment and 12 placebo) of the 
42 dogs that completed the study. A clinical comparison of 
these valid subjects was carried out to obtain mean baseline 
values for the cartilage degradation biomarker, CTX-II. 
Statistical analysis of serum CTX-II levels revealed that 
supplementation with EM produced a significant treatment 
response versus placebo at 6 weeks (47.9% improvement, 
P=0.018; Figure 1; placebo, baseline: 5.0±6.9 pg/mL and 
week 6: 6.9±7.5 pg/mL; EM, baseline: 5.0±11.6 pg/mL 
and week 6: 4.5±9.0 pg/mL). The intra-assay coefficient of 
variation was 5.13.
There were 15 AEs reported during the study. These were 
composed of three instances of loose stool, two instances 
of diarrhea, seven instances of vomiting, two instances of 
rash, and one instance of constipation. Eight AEs occurred 
in five placebo group subjects and seven AEs occurred in 
four treatment group subjects. All of the AEs were deemed 
unrelated to the study treatment. There were no serious AEs 
reported during the study. There were no treatment-related 
abnormalities in any of the clinical chemistry parameters 
evaluated in the study. Subject dog owners reported that the 
treatment was well tolerated by their pets.
Discussion
Joint and connective tissue disorders are extremely com-
mon in dogs and can have a significant impact on the QOL

for those that suffer from the debilitating conditions. This 
trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of EM ESM as a natural treatment alternative 
for dogs suffering from suboptimal joint function. Results 
of this study demonstrate that EM is both effective and 
safe for treating pain (CBPI and VCSA) and immobility 
(CBPI) associated with suboptimal joint function and 
effectively improves the QOL (CBPI) of the dogs  
receiving 
the supplement.
Subject dogs experienced a relatively rapid (1 week) 
response as rated by CBPI pain with a mean improvement 
of 19.4%. By the end of the 6-week follow-up period, the 
mean response for joint pain improved to 23.6% as judged 
by veterinarians (VCSA). By comparison, Moreau et al30 
found no benefit in dogs with OA even after 8 weeks of 
treatment with a supplement containing glucosamine (GluN) 
hydrochloride and CS. McCarthy et al32 found a similar 
treatment response from a Glu/CS supplement to that found 
from EM presented here; however, this benefit was only 
seen after >9 weeks of supplementation. Importantly, both 
studies utilized veterinarian assessments nearly identical 
to our VCSA. The rapid onset of the treatment effect from 
EM is on par with that found for meloxicam and carprofen 
evaluated in these same studies. A brief responder analysis 
of the pain-related data from the current study provides a 
number of clinically relevant highlights. Approximately 
one-half (48%) of the EM-treated subjects experienced a 
≥33% improvement in both VCSA pain and CBPI pain by 
6 weeks (not shown). Importantly, the owner assessments of 
pain were corroborated by the veterinarian assessments of 
pain, and these results align well with results from  
previous 
responder analyses in clinical studies of EM that were con-
ducted in humans.20–22
Subject dogs also experienced a relatively rapid 
(1 week) response as rated by CBPI function with a mean 
improvement of 20.5%. By the end of the 6-week follow-up 
period, the mean response for CBPI function improved to 
21.1%. The sizeable improvements noted by the dog owners 
could not be fully corroborated by the veterinarian assess-
ments of mobility and lameness (w and t), which improved 
by an average of 11.7%, 9.4%, and 10.8%, respectively. 
This disagreement may be a consequence of the differ-
ence in precision between the two instruments. That is, the 
CBPI questionnaire utilizes a ten-point scale, whereas the 
VCSA questionnaires utilize a five-point scale (mobility) or 
seven-point scale (lameness). Therefore, a more substantial 
change in joint function is required to result in a change 
in VCSA scoring. It is also possible that the disagree-
ment in instruments arises from the inherent design of the 
questionnaires. That is, the VCSA questionnaires are more 
specific in their assessment of joint function, whereas the 
CBPI questionnaire evaluates joint function more broadly 
and generally.
The effect a treatment has on overall QOL can be an 
important determinant of treatment efficacy and ultimately 
future treatment compliance. Although joint pain, immobil-
ity, and lameness certainly factor into QOL, there are also 
certain intangible qualities that affect this aspect of treat-
ment, as well. Importantly, in the present study, dog owners 
reported a rapid (1 week) response in CBPI QOL with a mean 
improvement of 14.0%. By the end of the 6-week follow-up 
period, the mean response for CBPI QOL improved to 26.8%. 
The magnitude of this improvement would be expected to 
be clinically meaningful in the QOL of dogs suffering from 
suboptimal joint function.
Symptom relief is certainly a critical component of 
any arthritis treatment. However, the further capacity to 
reduce inflammation within the joint and preserve articular 
cartilage integrity – to be disease modifying – is lacking in 
currently available treatments. We report here for the first 
time the chondroprotective effects in dogs, as evidenced by 
the substantial reduction (47.9%) in the change in serum 
CTX-II levels after 6 weeks of supplementation with EM 
versus placebo. The capacity of EM to impact CTX-II so 
profoundly was first shown in a rat model of OA;35 however, 
the current study is the first evidence demonstrated in natu-
rally occurring joint disease. Evidence from prior studies

Ruff et al
involving EM indicates that this chondroprotective effect 
likely arises from reduced joint inflammation18,19 coupled 
with reduced levels of various cartilage-degrading matrix 
metalloproteinases.35
The safety profile for EM is also of significance as there 
have been no reports of serious AEs associated with treat-
ment in any of the clinical studies conducted to date. No side 
effects from consuming EM have thus far been identified, 
excluding the obvious egg allergy concern. This is of obvious 
importance in canine conditions such as hip dysplasia and 
OA that require long-term treatment.
The trial had a somewhat limited enrollment (51 sub-
jects); however, there was a fairly low drop-out rate (9.8%) 
and good treatment compliance. The variability in the 
severity of the suboptimal joint function in the study dogs 
likely made it more difficult to detect treatment responses, 
and this was complicated by the wide variety of breeds 
(and concurrent sizes) of dogs enrolled in the study, as 
well. The owner assessment (CBPI), although validated 
for use in the treatment of OA with NSAIDs, appeared to 
effectively detect changes in joint pain and joint function in 
this study. The veterinarian assessments (VCSA), although 
based upon previous assessment designs,29–31 were modi-
fied to a significant degree for this study and appeared to 
be effective tools for clinician assessment. The addition 
of additional objective measures of joint function (eg, 
force plate analysis, gait analysis) could prove beneficial. 
Further research is warranted to validate the use of serum 
CTX-II as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for canine 
cartilage status.
With so many dogs suffering from suboptimal joint 
function, it is important for dog owners to have treatment 
options that are both safe and effective. The reporting of 
the results from this eight-center randomized controlled 
trial demonstrates that EM ESM is a viable therapeutic 
option for the management of the pain and loss of func-
tion associated with suboptimal joint function in dogs. 
Supplementation with EM, 6 mg/lb (~13.5 mg/kg) taken 
once daily, significantly reduced joint pain and improved 
joint function rapidly (CBPI 1 week) and demonstrated 
a lasting improvement in joint pain (VCSA 6 weeks) 
leading to an improved QOL (CBPI 6 weeks). Moreover, 
a profound chondroprotective effect was demonstrated 
following 6 weeks of supplementation with EM. There 
were also clinically meaningful results from a brief 
responder analysis, demonstrating that a significant pro-
portion of treated dogs will benefit substantially from EM 
supplementation.
