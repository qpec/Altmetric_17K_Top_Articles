Synucleinophaties are progressive neurodegenerative disorders with no cure to date. An attractive 
strategy to tackle this problem is repurposing already tested safe drugs against novel targets. In this 
way, doxycycline prevents neurodegeneration in Parkinson models by modulating neuroinflammation. 
However, anti-inflammatory therapy per se is insufficient to account for neuroprotection. Herein 
we characterise novel targets of doxycycline describing the structural background supporting its 
effectiveness as a neuroprotector at subantibiotic doses. Our results show that doxycycline reshapes 
α-synuclein oligomers into off-pathway, high-molecular-weight species that do not evolve into fibrils. 
Off-pathway species present less hydrophobic surface than on-pathway oligomers and display different 
β-sheet structural arrangement. These structural changes affect the α-synuclein ability to destabilize 
biological membranes, cell viability, and formation of additional toxic species. Altogether, these 
mechanisms could act synergically giving novel targets for repurposing this drug.
The abnormal accumulation of α 
-synuclein amyloid aggregates in neural or glial cells is the common event in 
neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleinopathies1. It encompasses pathologies with devastating clinical 
prognosis like Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy2–4. While the 
basis of neurotoxicity of α 
-synuclein remains controversial, it is now accepted that certain oligomeric species 
generated during α 
-synuclein amyloid self-assembly are most likely key players in the initiation5 and spreading of 
the pathology6. In addition, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation have also been 
signed as responsible for neuronal cell death. However, compelling evidence shows that α 
-synuclein aggregation 
can trigger all these events7–11 and sometimes vice versa12, suggesting that these processes could be intertwined 
fostering a vicious circle with fatal consequences for neurons.

A significant number of molecules signed as efficient inhibitors of neuroinflammation, α 
-synuclein amy-
loid self-assembly, oxidative stress, or mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro, have failed to provide an effective 
neuro-protection in vivo13. Moreover, drugs developed to block one component of the death process at a time 
have proved ineffective in clinical trials and therefore nowadays the challenge must be directed in search of 
multi-targeted molecules to reach an efficient neuroprotective effect14. On the contrary, doxycycline, an antibiotic 
belonging to the family of tetracyclines, has been reported to exhibit neuroprotective activity in both MPTP15 and 
6-OHDA16 animal models of PD. In fact, this antibiotic was able to mitigate the loss of dopaminergic neurons 
in the substantia nigra pars compacta and nerve terminals in the striatum. It has been proposed that the mecha-
nism underlying this effect is the ability of doxycycline to diminish neuroinflammation17. Since treatment with 
anti-inflammatory compounds alone has not proved to be enough to prevent neurodegeneration18, we propose 
doxycycline to have an additional target. Indeed, doxycycline has been shown to inhibit fibril formation of amy-
loidogenic proteins such as Aβ 
 peptide19, PrP peptide20 and β 
-microglobulin21. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, 
there are no mechanistic studies on the effect of doxycycline on either α 
-synuclein aggregation or seeding.
In the present paper, we show the ability of doxycycline to interfere with the pathologic cycle involved in 
synucleinopathies at the aggregation level for the first time. We demonstrate that doxycycline interacts with 
α 
-synuclein early aggregation intermediates leading to the formation of off-pathway species, with parallel β 
-sheet 
content, that do not evolve into fibril formation. In contrast to on-pathway oligomers, these aggregates are neither 
cytotoxic to dopaminergic cell lines, nor capable of disrupting the integrity of liposomes membrane. Furthermore, 
doxycycline is also able to block the seeding capacity of α 
-synuclein preformed aggregates. Taken together, our 
results shed light on the mechanism by which doxycycline affects α 
-synuclein aggregation and seeding of new 
oligomers. This novel mechanism of action might act in a synergic way with those previously proposed to explain 
the neuroprotective effect on models in vivo. Moreover, according to our data, subantibiotic doses of doxycycline 
would be high enough to interfere with the production of α 
-synuclein toxic species. Results presented herein 
place doxycycline as a pleiotropic drug becoming an attractive therapeutic strategy against synucleinopathies.
Results
Doxycycline inhibits α-synuclein aggregation through the formation of off-pathway oligomers. 
 
To analyze the ability of doxycycline to interfere with the fibril assembly process of α 
-synuclein, we incubated 
70 μ 
M α 
-synuclein in the absence or in the presence of 100 μ 
M doxycycline at 37 °C under orbital agitation. 
Self-association kinetics of α 
-synuclein was monitored as an increase in fluorescence emission of Thioflavin T 
(ThT) at 482 nm (λ 
exc 450 nm) upon binding of this probe to aggregates rich in cross-β structure22. In accordance 
to previous reports23, the aggregation kinetic of α 
-synuclein in the absence of doxycycline shows a lag phase of 
18 h followed by an exponential growth to finally reach a plateau at 48 h (Fig. 1a). Conversely, in the presence of 
doxycycline the aggregation kinetic of α 
-synuclein is severely affected. According to the fluorescent probe, when 
doxycycline is added at the beginning of the incubation, the formation of aggregates with cross-β 
 structure is

kinetics are shown in (empty circle).

dramatically diminished. However, once the exponential growth phase has been reached, addition of doxycycline 
has no observable effect on the aggregation kinetic of α 
-synuclein (Fig. 1a).
To evaluate the impact of doxycycline on the morphology of the species present along the aggregation path-
way, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies on samples of monomeric α 
-synuclein incu-
bated with or without doxycycline and harvested at different times (Fig. 1b). After 16 h of incubation, we were 
able to detect oligomeric species in both conditions, which were morphologically undistinguishable by TEM. 
Nevertheless, only in the absence of doxycycline, oligomers evolved into fibrils, which were observed after 96 h 
incubation. This data suggests that doxycycline halt the assembly of α 
-synuclein oligomers into larger aggregates 
since only oligomers but not fibrils are still observed at this time. In fact, the absence of fibrils in the samples that 
contained doxycycline is consistent with the lack of cross-β 
 observed using the ThT fluorescent probe (Fig. 1a).
To assess whether α 
-synuclein oligomers formed in the presence of doxycycline are on-pathway or 
off-pathway intermediates in the fibril formation process, we also carried out seeding experiments. For this, seeds 
were produced by incubating α 
-synuclein solution at 37 °C under orbital agitation for 16 h in the absence or pres-
ence of doxycycline. Then, an aliquot of the solution containing α 
-synuclein seeds was added to fresh solutions 
of monomeric α 
-synuclein and further incubated for 72 h (Fig. 1c). The addition of seeds formed in the absence 
of doxycycline accelerates the aggregation process and more species with cross-β 
 structure are self-assembled 
from native α 
-synuclein as indicated by increased ThT fluorescence. In contrast, the oligomers formed in the 
presence of doxycycline are not able to further convert into amyloid fibrils. This indicates that oligomers formed 
in the presence of doxycycline did not function as template for the conversion of unpolymerized proteins into 
amyloid fibrils and we will further refer to them as off-pathway oligomers throughout the paper in contrast to the 
on-pathway oligomers formed in the absence of doxycycline.
Inhibition of α-synuclein fibrillation is mediated by binding of doxycycline to oligomeric species. 
 
The anti-amyloid activity of doxycycline prompted us to explore details of its binding to α 
-synuclein by NMR spec-
troscopy. To analyze this interaction we used 1H-15N NMR heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) 
 
spectra. The 1H-15N spectrum of a sample of uniformly 15N-labeled α 
-synuclein, reflecting the intrinsically dis-
order nature of the protein, is shown in Fig. 2a. Upon titration of 15N-enriched α 
-synuclein with increasing 
concentrations of doxycycline, the 1H-15N HMQC spectra retained the excellent resolution of the uncomplexed, 
monomeric protein. Notably, no broadening or chemical shift perturbations could be observed, even at high 
ligand:α 
-synuclein ratios (5:1), indicating that doxycycline is unable to interact with monomeric α 
-synuclein.
To assess further the nature of the α 
-synuclein species involved in the interaction with doxycycline, we con-
ducted NMR experiments aimed at detecting directly the signals belonging to the anti-amyloid compound. 
High-ordered oligomeric or prefibrillar α 
-synuclein species are invisible to the NMR approach used here24,25,

although certain oligomers retaining high flexibility at the C-terminal region could be even detected26. Hence, a 
potential interaction of the antibiotic with those species will not become evident by using an NMR strategy based 
on the detection of protein backbone resonances. On the contrary, the 1D 1H NMR spectrum of doxycycline 
shows well-resolved resonances in the 6.0–7.0 ppm region, which constitutes an excellent probe for exploring the 
binding features of the antibiotic to α 
-synuclein. As expected, addition of 0.5 equiv. of monomeric α 
-synuclein 
to doxycycline samples caused no perturbations in the 1D 1H NMR spectrum of the small ligand, confirming the 
lack of interaction of the compound with the monomeric form of the protein (Figure 2b,c). By contrast, a substan-
tial broadening of doxycycline signals was observed when aliquots of aged α 
-synuclein samples (24–48 h) were 
added, indicating that doxycycline is able to bind to the larger molecular species formed during the aggregation 
event (Fig. 2c). Even though changes in the signals of doxycycline upon the addition of α 
-synuclein aged for 8 h 
were not so prominent we still observed a small decrease in signal intensities, specially in the set of resonances 
centered at c.a. 6.95 ppm. These small perturbations are likely attributed to the small number of oligomers present 
in the sample at short aggregation times. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we analyzed the spectra recorded for 
doxycycline alone or upon the addition of fresh or aged (16 h) α 
-synuclein samples (Supplementary Figure S1). 
Although no fibrils could be detected on these samples (see Fig. 1a,d), they were centrifuged to spin down and 
remove minor insoluble species that could have been formed under our experimental conditions. Even after 
this treatment, signal attenuation in doxycycline remained unaltered (see the set of peaks centered at 6.95 ppm 
and 6.35 ppm), suggesting an interaction landscape formed mostly by soluble oligomers or early protofibrils. 
A comparative analysis between the intensities of α 
-synuclein resonances located at the methyl and aromatic 
regions (only signals showing no overlapping with doxycycline resonances were considered), shows no differ-
ences between the spectra recorded at 0 and 16 h, indicating the absence of slow-tumbling, highly-ordered struc-
tures such as amyloid fibrils or large protofibrils27, in full agreement with ThT and TEM data. Since monomeric 
α 
-synuclein is not able to interact with doxycycline (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Figure S1a), we assume that 
the attenuation observed for the signals of the compound under the experimental conditions described above are 
reflective of an interaction process with low-order oligomeric or protofibrillar α 
-synuclein species retaining some 
degrees of molecular flexibility. Altogether, these evidences indicate that binding of doxycycline to α 
-synuclein 
proceeds initially via interactions with aggregated species formed during the early stages of the assembly process, 
a molecular event that might provide a central mechanistic basis for the inhibitory process of doxycycline on 
α 
-synuclein fibrillation.
Off-pathway oligomers present a different structural arrangement. 
In order to gain further 
insights on how doxycycline impacts on α 
-synuclein aggregation leading to the formation of off-pathway species, 
three complementary techniques were employed. These were small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), bis-ANS flu-
orescence, and Fourier Transformed Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). SAXS reports changes in protein aggregates 
morphology (shape and size), bis-ANS infers the amount of hydrophobic surface exposed to the solvent, while 
FT-IR gives deeper insight into the oligomers structural organization being a technique particularly sensitive to 
β 
-sheet structure arrangements28.
For SAXS measurements, α 
-synuclein was incubated up to 24 h at 37 °C under orbital agitation in the absence 
or in the presence of doxycycline. SAXS data were acquired from aliquots taken at different elapsed times along 
the aggregation process (Fig. 3a–d). Note that right after its addition, doxycycline produces no immediate impact 
on the scattering curve from in-solution α 
-synuclein (Fig. 3a). However, its influence can be clearly detected 
after 2 h of incubation through the increase in the scattering intensity at low q values in comparison to the scat-
tering from doxycycline-free α 
-synuclein (Fig. 3b). Such a behavior is a fingerprint of the formation of larger 
α 
-synuclein aggregates in comparison to those self-assembled in the absence of doxycycline. This was systemati-
cally reproduced over time. Therefore, SAXS data demonstrated that off-pathway α 
-synuclein oligomers formed 
in the presence of doxycycline are larger than on-pathway oligomers. Interestingly, the corresponding pair dis-
tance distribution functions, p(r), show that on-pathway oligomers evolve to fibril-like aggregates along time 
(Fig. 3e). The maximum frequency of distances (rmax) inside the protein aggregate remains practically constant at 
4 nm, while the maximum dimension, Dmax, elongates from 30 nm to 40 nm over 24 hours (Fig. 3e). On the other 
hand, off-pathway aggregates present a displacement toward larger distances in both rmax (up to 22 nm), and Dmax(up 
to 55 nm) (Fig. 3f). It should be stressed that aggregates larger than 55 nm can be formed but such dimension is over 
the upper detection limit of SAXS under our experimental conditions. Taken together with TEM results, the changes 
in the p(r) function features with time indicate that doxycycline impacts on α 
-synuclein aggregation pathway by 
deviating early elongated on-pathway oligomers into the formation of larger off-pathway oligomers (Fig. 1b).
Infrared spectra, in the amide I region (1,700–1,600 cm−1), is particularly sensitive to the backbone confor-
mation of proteins, allowing to discriminate the relative composition of secondary structure elements29. In order 
to perform a comparative analysis between α 
-synuclein on-pathway and off-pathway oligomers, the protein was 
incubated in the presence or in the absence of doxycycline and aliquots were taken at regular times for infrared 
spectra collection. At the beginning of incubation, samples are clearly very similar and suggest that the structural 
content is comparable regardless the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 4a). After Fourier self-deconvolution process, 
the amide I shows a contour centered at 1,649 cm−1 that is typical of an unfolded protein30. However, after 2 h 
incubation (Fig. 4b), off-pathways oligomers reflect increased content of ordered secondary structure, as revealed 
by the decrease in the FTIR band at 1,641 cm−1 (Table 1).
The half-width at half-height (HWHH) of the Amide I’ band reflects the structuration process of a protein 
and, as shown in Fig. 4b and c, off-pathway species seems to be more structured than than the on-pathway ones. 
Moreover, the amount of β 
-structure and the arrangement of the β 
-strands were also different in both species. 
In fact, off-pathway α 
-synuclein oligomers are rich in parallel β 
-sheet structure as shown by the presence of a 
band at 1,619–1,634 cm−1 and the absence of an absorption band at approximately 1,685 cm−1. On the contrary, 
the β 
-sheet structure of the on-pathway oligomers is predominantly antiparallel as indicated by a band at about 
 www.nature.com/scientificreports/

1,625 cm−1 with a high frequency component at approximately 1,685 cm−1, approximately fivefold weaker than 
the band at 1,625 cm−1. Remarkably, the differential organization of the β 
-sheet structure into parallel or antipar-
allel forms has been previously related to cytotoxicity28.
The intrinsic physicochemical properties of the oligomeric species, like hydrophobic solvent exposition, have 
also been associated to toxicity due to its relation to membrane binding and perturbation as well as cellular 
dysfunction. Accordingly, we measured the surface hydrophobicity of on-pathway and off-pathway α 
-synuclein 
oligomers using bis-ANS, a dye known to increase its fluorescence quantum yield upon binding to hydropho-
bic pockets on protein surfaces31. The emission spectra of bis-ANS when added to pre-incubated solutions 
of α 
-synuclein, reveals that there is a constant increase of hydrophobic surface exposure during aggregation 
(Fig. 4d), as reflected by a 65% enhancement in the quantum yield of the probe (calculated from areas under the 
curve). On the contrary, when doxycycline was present in the preincubated mixture, the fluorescence intensity 
remained unaltered up to 16 h (Fig. 4e), and reached a 10% increase in fluorescence between 24 and 72 h, indicat-
ing that off-pathway oligomers expose hydrophobic patches to a lesser extent.
Overall, these results suggest that doxycycline induces differential conformational changes in α 
-synuclein 
oligomers, resulting in the formation of off-pathway oligomers with well-distinctive features in terms of shape, 
size, structure and hydrophobic surface exposure.

Doxycycline reshapes α-synuclein into non-toxic oligomers. 
Cytotoxicity of α 
-synuclein has been 
attributed to transient prefibrillar species formed during protein aggregation5. Indeed, the pathogenicity associ-
ated to the these prefibrillar species has been linked to the conformational arrangement of the aggregate species 
as revealed by conformation-specific antibodies32 as well as FTIR studies28. Therefore, we assessed the impact of 
the structural changes induced by doxycycline on the pathogenicity of α 
-synuclein oligomers. First, we carried 
out cell viability studies on SH-SY5Y cell line using the MTT assay33, which reports viable cell number based on 
the mitochondrial activity. For this, on-pathway and off-pathway α 
-synuclein oligomers were obtained by prein-
cubation of 140 μ 
M α 
-synuclein in the absence or presence of 200 μ 
M doxycycline, respectively for 16 h at 37 °C 
under orbital agitation. A 25 μ 
l aliquot of each preparation was added to SH-SY5Y cells and further incubated at 
37 °C. As previously described23, on-pathway oligomeric species were able to decrease cell viability as reflected 
by the 40% decrease in the turnover of MTT (Fig. 5a). When cells were treated with off-pathway oligomers we 
observed no significant difference from controls on MTT turnover. It should be noticed that the presence of 
doxycycline in the culture medium was not capable to prevent the deleterious effect that on-pathway oligomers 
exerted on SH-SY5Y cells.
Interestingly, one of the proposed mechanisms by which α 
-synuclein oligomers produce cytotoxicity is by 
inducing a perturbation on the cell membrane integrity34. Therefore, we measured the release of the cytosolic 
enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from cells into the medium, which is commonly used as a measure of 
cytotoxicity by membrane impairment (Fig. 5b). Once again, on-pathway oligomers showed cytotoxicity against 
SH-SY5Y cells as reflected by the 40% increase in the release of LDH into the culture medium. On the contrary, in 
the presence of off-pathway oligomers cell integrity is well preserved. Preservation of cell integrity is not observed 
when doxycycline is added to the culture medium before the addition of on-pathway oligomers.

shape of 18 cm−1 and a resolution enhancement factor of 2. Derivative spectra (bottom) were obtained with a 
power of three and a break-point of 0.3. Bis-ANS fluorescence signal of α

the samples were taken throughout time. All results shown are representative of at least four independent 
experiments.

The differential capability of α 
-synuclein oligomers to affect membrane integrity, as showed by LDH assays, 
was also analyzed by content leakage assays on synthetic membranes. To do that, we monitored the release of 
calcein entrapped in rat brain lipid vesicles upon the addition of α 
-synuclein oligomers (Fig. 5c). In line with 
cytotoxicity assays, on-pathway α 
-synuclein oligomers induced the release of the fluorescent probe from lipos-
omes, confirming the ability of these species to disrupt membrane integrity; while off-pathway oligomers showed

-synuclein was also used 
as a negative control for cell viability, cytotoxicity and leakage assays. On-pathway, and off-pathway α 
-synuclein 
oligomers were prepared by incubating 140 μ 
M α 
-synuclein in the absence, or in the presence of 200 μ 
M 
doxycycline respectively for 16 h under orbital agitation at 37 °C.

no destabilizing effect over lipid membranes. The addition of doxycycline to liposomes did not prevent calcein 
release induced by on-pathway oligomers showing that the antibiotic does not stabilize the membrane by a direct 
interaction nor does it blocks the deleterious effect of on-pathway oligomers upon binding to their surface.
Altogether, these results suggest that the protective effect of doxycycline could be attributed to the remodeling 
of α 
-synuclein into off-pathway oligomers that are not able to impair membrane integrity and not by a direct 
effect of the antibiotic on the cells.
Discussion
The current consensus suggests that synucleinophaties develop from complex gene–environment interactions 
and, thus, more than one causative process is underlying the neurodegenerative pathogenesis. In fact, protein 
aggregation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial functional disruption, and lysosomal dysfunc-
tion constitute an endless loop with fatal consequences on neurons.
In spite of the long-standing search for new drugs aimed at reducing the impact of synucleinophaties and 
particularly of PD, nowadays the available therapies for these pathologies are merely palliative. Indeed, drugs 
that are able to block the process in vitro do not work properly in vivo due to their toxicity or low bioavailability 
in the brain. In order to overcome this failure, alternative drug development strategies are now being explored, 
such as the repurposing of existing compounds with novel targets35 i.e. take advantage of the treasure of potential 
therapeutics in the pharmacopoeia. This could save a considerable amount of time and money since information 
about the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and drug side effects are already established.
Doxycycline, a semi-synthetic second-generation tetracycline, is used currently as a typical antibiotic 
in humans having clinical safety record and good penetration of the blood–brain barrier36. In addition to its 
well-characterised antibiotic effect, doxycycline has revealed a range of different targets mainly focused on the 
regulatory influence on the immune system, inflammatory pathway and oxidative stress37,38. In fact, by tuning the 
doxycycline concentration, it is possible to select the anti-inflammatory or antibiotic activity. In this way, some 
clinical trials demonstrated that antibiotic dose administration (200–400 mg/day) is responsible for the antimicro-
bial effect which may lead to develop bacterial resistance and endogenous flora alterations, whereas subantibiotic 
doses (20–40 mg/day) do not alter bacteria susceptibility to antibiotics and exert anti-inflammatory activities39. 
Neuroprotective properties of doxycycline in models of cerebral ischemia, spinal cord injury, PD, Huntington’s 
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis were also reported40–42. The anti-inflammatory prop-
erties of doxycycline have been proposed as the mechanism involved in the neuroprotective effect. Nevertheless, 
treatment with conventional anti-inflammatory drugs has not proved effective in neuroprotection, suggesting 
that this mechanism alone would not be enough18.
Here we demonstrate an additional mechanism by which doxycycline could exert neuroprotection which 
could complement the previously well-reported anti-inflammatory17,39 and anti-oxidant effects38. We show for 
the first time that the presence of doxycycline induces a remodelling of α 
-synuclein oligomers into off-pathway 
non-toxic, non-seeding species. This remodelling process is only efficient on early species of the aggregation 
process, since the addition of doxycycline after 16 h incubation did not produce any change in the α 
-synuclein 
aggregation kinetics or its cytotoxicity (Fig. 1a and b). According with NMR data, doxycycline is able to bind oli-
gomeric α 
-synuclein species, but not to the monomeric protein. Congo Red, lacmoid and epigallocatechin gallate, 
are also small molecules which inhibit α 
-synuclein fibrillization by interacting with the monomeric protein26,43. 
On the contrary, doxycycline binds only to oligomeric species preserving the monomeric form of the protein for 
its physiological function26.
Electron microscopy showed that doxycycline-remodelled oligomers do not evolve to fibrils. In addition, flu-
orescence studies show that the formation of cross-β 
 structure is halted in the presence of doxycycline. Moreover, 
lesser hydrophobic surface was detected, suggesting a different structural arrangement of the intermediate 
species. In fact, infrared studies demonstrated the presence of parallel β 
-sheet instead of the typical antiparal-
lel β 
-sheet reported for on-pathway toxic oligomeric species28. The impact of doxycycline on the assembly of 
α 
-synuclein oligomers is also evidenced by the changes in size and shape of the aggregates, as revealed by SAXS 
experiments. Overall, the different structural organization of off-pathway oligomers results on a decreased ability 
to alter cell viability and membrane permeability, as compared to on-pathway oligomers.
Baicalein is an active flavonoid, which also induces the formation of non-toxic off-pathways α 
-synuclein oli-
gomers, but its use as neuroprotector is controversial since the flavonoid triggers intrinsic and extrinsic apop-
totic pathways44. In the same way, gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) and some of its derivatives may 
interact with α 
-synuclein oligomers by a mechanism similar to doxycycline, i.e. halting the fibrillation process 
through the formation of off-pathway non-toxic oligomers which are unable to induce the seeding on monomeric 
α 
-synuclein45. However, there is no data on bioavailability or pharmacokinetics or side effects of this compound 
in vivo.
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) also reduces significantly cell toxicity of α 
-Syn aggregates by binding to pre-
formed oligomers and fibrils46 with effectiveness comparable with doxycycline (1:1 molar ratio)47. However, the 
instability, low solubility, little oral bioavailability of curcumin limit its clinical applications and to overcome this 
drawback, some structural curcumin analogues with antiaggregation properties are been developed. In this con-
text, no human long-term toxicity studies have been reported until now with curcumin structural analogues48. 
On the contrary, oral administration of doxycycline proved to be a safe and effective drug for dermatologically 
long-term treatments49,50. Moreover, it was also reported that sub-antibiotic doses of doxycycline have no effect 
on the composition or antibiotic resistance of different microflora51.
The seeding effect on monomeric α 
-synuclein, characteristic of toxic oligomers, was also blocked in the pres-
ence of doxycycline. It has been shown that toxic species of α 
-synuclein may be transmitted from diseased cells to 
healthy neurons where they induce the conversion of native α 
-synuclein into toxic oligomeric species, following a

seeding-nucleation mechanism52,53. Our results suggest that doxycycline structurally remodelled species abolish 
the seeding process and, thus, they would interfere with the spreading process (Fig. 6).
Putting together our results, the presence of doxycycline can attenuate the pathological cycle described in 
Fig. 6 at five different points: inhibiting synuclein aggregation and seeding, neuroinflammation in glial cells, 
mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS damage.
According to our dose:response studies (see Supplementary Figure S2), an equimolar concentration of dox-
ycycline to α 
-synuclein would be suitable to reach a protective effect. While in cerebrospinal fluid the concen-
tration achieved by doxycycline during the oral treatment as antimicrobial (200 mg twice day) is about 3 μ 
M 
(considering the main penetration of the antibiotic in 26%) the α 
-synuclein concentration is about 0.12 nM54. 
This data strongly suggests that doxycycline in subantibiotic doses (20–40 mg/day) would be enough to exert 
neuroprotection.
The results presented herein reveal potential protective side effects for doxycycline in the pathogenesis cycle 
of synucleinopathies that could be exploited repurposing an old safe drug.
Methods
Preparation of α-synuclein. 
Expression and purification of recombinant human α 
-synuclein was per-
formed as previously described55. The purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Monomeric α 
-synuclein 
stock solutions were prepared in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Prior to measurements, protein solutions 
were filtered and centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × 
 g. Protein concentration was determined by the measurement 
of absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficient ε 
275 = 5600 cm−1 M−1.
Protein aggregation. 
The aggregation protocol was adapted from previous studies56. Monomeric 
α 
-synuclein solutions (70 μ 
M) in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, were incubated in a Thermomixer com-
fort (Eppendorf) at 37 °C under orbital agitation at 700 rev./min in the absence or in the presence of 100 μ 
M 
doxycycline.
Figure 6. Schematic diagram of the feedback relationship between α-synuclein, mitochondria and glial 
cells. The oligomeric species of α 
-synuclein provoke mitochondria fragmentation and ROS production is 
increased. ROS impacts on monomeric α 
-synuclein triggering its aggregation. The oligomeric α 
-synuclein 
released to the extracellular matrix inducing glia activation. Liberation of pro-inflammatory factors induces 
mitochondrial damage in an endless cycle. Doxycycline can interfere with this vicious circle blocking (i) α 
-synuclein oligomers nucleation and (ii) seeding, (iii) glia activation16, and (iv) ROS activity37.

Thioflavin T assay. 
Formation of cross-β structure during aggregation was followed by addition of Thioflavin 
T (ThT) fluorescent probe on aliquots withdrawn from the incubation mixture at different times, according to 
LeVine22. Changes in the emission fluorescence spectra with the excitation wavelength set at 450 nm was moni-
tored using an ISS (Champaign, IL) PC1 spectro fluorometer.
Transmission Electron Microscopy. 
Samples (30 μ 
l) of a 14 μ 
M α 
-synuclein solution were adsorbed onto 
glow-discharged 200 mesh formvar carbon coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stained with 
aqueous uranyLess (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Excess liquid was removed and grids were allowed to air dry. 
Samples were viewed using a Hitachi 7700 transmission electron microscope.
Bis-ANS. 
α 
-synuclein was aggregated as described above in the absence or presence of doxycycline. Aliquots 
were taken at regular time and bis-ANS was added to a final concentration of 5 μ 
M. Bis-ANS was excited at 
395 nm, and fluorescence emission was collected from 410 to 610 nm.
SAXS. 
Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) data from 175 μ 
M α 
-synuclein, in the absence or presence of 
doxycycline were obtained on SAXS1 beamline at the Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron (LNLS, Campinas, 
Brazil). The radiation wavelength was set to 0.148 nm and a Pilatus 300 detector was used to record the scattering 
patterns. The sample-to-detector distance was set to ~1000 mm allowing us to explore a minimum scattering 
vector of 0.10 nm−1, where q is the magnitude of the scattering q-vector defined by q = 
 (4π 
/λ)sinθ (being 2θ 
the scattering angle). In this way, the maximum particle distance accessible from our experimental set-up was 
circa 60 nm. Samples were set between two mica windows and a 1 mm spacer, handled in a liquid sample-holder 
placed perpendicular to the incoming beam. The obtained curves were normalized by taking into account the 
X-ray beam intensity decrease during the experiment. The scattering curve of the buffer solution was subtracted 
from the sample’s SAXS curves, considering each sample’s attenuation. All measurements were taken at room 
temperature.
A Fourier Transform connects the scattering intensity, I(q), to the pair distance distribution function p(r) in 
the absence of interference effects. Such a function is model-free and represents the frequency of distances within 
the entire volume of the scattering particle, thus giving information to the particle maximum dimension, Dmax, 
where p(r) goes to zero. In the current paper, p(r) functions from SAXS curves were obtained by making use of 
GNOM software57.
NMR. 
All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600 MHz Avance III spectrometer using a cryogeni-
cally cooled triple resonance 1H(13C/15N) TCI probe. 1D 1H and 2D 1H-15N SOFAST-HMQC (band-Selective 
Optimized Flip Angle Short Transient) experiments were recorded at 15 °C on samples dissolved in buffer Hepes 
20 mM at pH 7.4 in the presence of 150 mM NaCl and 10% D2O. SOFAST-HMQC spectra were acquired with the 
following parameters: 32 scans, 30 ms recycling delay, 1 K and 256 increments and SW of 16 and 26 ppm in the 1H 
and 15N dimension, respectively. After acquisition, spectra were zero-filled to 4 K (1H) and 2 K (15N), processed 
with sine bell apodization and baseline corrected.
To characterise the interaction between doxycycline and aged α 
-synuclein we incubated solutions of mon-
omeric α 
-synuclein (300 μ 
L, 100 μ 
M) at 37 °C under constant stirring at 280 rpm using small magnetic bars. 
Samples were dissolved in 20 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7.4 with 150 mM NaCl and 10% D2O. The formation of 
amyloid fibrils was monitored by drawing 2 μ 
L aliquots at different times from each sample, diluting them into 
2 mL solutions in the presence of 10 μ 
M thioflavin T and measuring its fluorescence at 480 nm as previously 
described56. We removed the samples from the incubator at times 0, 8, 24 and 48 h, spiked them with 200 μ 
M dox-
ycycline from a 5 mM freshly prepared stock solution and immediately run the 1D-1H NMR spectra. Thioflavin-T 
fluorescence plateau after ~40 h of incubation under these aggregation conditions. In another set of experiments, 
samples of α 
-synuclein aged for 0 h and 16 h were centrifuged for 1 h, at 15000 rpm, 4 °C to remove insoluble 
species that might have formed under the experimental conditions of our experiments, before adding them to the 
doxycycline solution. The NMR spectra were recorded using 8 K points, a SW of 16 ppm, 512 scans and a recy-
cling delay of 1 sec. Spectra were zerofilled to 32 K, processed with sine bell apodization and baseline corrected. 
All spectra were acquired and processed using Topspin 3.2 (Bruker) and analyzed using Topspin (1D 1H) and 
Sparky (1H-15N SOFAST-HMQC).
Infrared Spectroscopy. 
Samples at 280 μ 
M of α 
-synuclein in the absence or the presence of 400 μ 
M doxycy-
cline in buffer 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pD 7.0, D2O were collected after 0, 2 and 16 h of orbital incubation 
at 37 °C. Since monomeric α 
-synuclein was higher than the oligomeric species, after incubation we partially sep-
arated from the monomer using an Amicon Ultra-0.5 100 kDa cut-off filter and assembled in a thermostated cell 
between two CaF2 windows with a path length of 50 nm. The spectra were recorded in a Nicolet 5700 spectrome-
ter equipped with a DTGS detector (Thermo Nicolet, Madison, WI) as previously described29. The sample cham-
ber was permanently purged with dry air. The spectra were generated by averaging 256 interferograms collected 
with a nominal resolution of 2 cm−1 and apodized with a Happ-Genzel function. The D2O contribution in the 
amide I´ region was eliminated by subtracting the buffer spectra from that of the solution at the same temperature 
to obtain a flat baseline between 1,900 and 1,700 cm−1. Solvent subtraction, deconvolution, determination of band 
position and curve fitting of the original amide I band were performed as described29. The error in determination 
of the FTIR structural analysis from the amide I band from different runs is 3%.
Human neuroblastoma cell culture. 
SH-SY5Y cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PS), at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For cell viability and cytotoxicity 
assay cells were seeded in 96 wells plates at 15,000 cells/well, and 30,000 cells/well, respectively and maintained

in 100 μ 
l of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PS for 24 h at 37 °C. Afterwards, cells were treated 
with a 25 μ 
l aliquot of 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl buffer, pH 7.4 (control), or 140 μ 
M α 
-synuclein aged for 
16 h at 37 °C under orbital agitation in the absence (on-pathway oligomers) or presence of 200 μ 
M doxycycline 
(off-pathway oligomers). Alternatively, on-pathway oligomers were also added together with doxycycline to the 
culture medium (on-pathway oligomers + 
doxy). After treatment, cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C 5% CO2. 
To determine cell viability, the colorimetric MTT metabolic activity assay was used as previously described by 
Mosmann33. All experiments were performed in sextuplicate, and the relative cell viability (%) was expressed as a 
percentage relative to the untreated cell control. Cytotoxicity was determined using the Cytotoxicity Detection Kit 
(Roche) following instructions from the manufacturer. The assay is based on the measurement of the activity of 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture medium upon permeabilization or lysis of cells. Percentage 
of cytotoxicity is referred to the LDH activity released from cells after treatment with 1% Triton X-100.
Calcein Release Assay. 
The lipid mixture used for this experiment was extracted from brain membranes 
of Wistar white rats by Folch method58. Rats were provided by the “Bioterio” Instituto de Química Biológica 
(Facultad de Bioquímica, Química y Farmacia, UNT, Tucumán. Argentina). Rats were obtained by exocria and 
maintained under controlled temperature and humidity under a 12 h light-dark cycle. Animals were maintained 
and treated in accordance with the criteria established in the “Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals”
, 
published by the “Institute of Laboratory Animal and National Research (1999)”
. After extraction, lipids were 
stored in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). For the preparation of large multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), lipids were 
dried under nitrogen onto the wall of a Corex glass tube, placed in a vacuum oven to completely remove any 
remaining solvent and then rehydrated in 25 mM Tris, 50 mM calcein, pH 7.4 buffer. In order to obtain small 
unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), we followed the protocol described by Finer59. Briefly, MLVs were sonicated with 
probe-type sonicator under nitrogen and controlled temperature. To remove titanium debris the suspension was 
centrifuged for 15 min at 1100 × 
 g. In order to separate Calcein- loaded SUV from free dye we used Sephadex 
G-75. During incubation, changes in the fluorescent intensity of the different mixtures were monitored at 
 
λ 
exc = 
 490 nm, λ 
em = 
 510 nm in a ISS (Champaign, IL, USA) PC1 spectrofluorometer as previously described by 
Kendall (47). α 
-synuclein (140 μ 
M) incubated in the absence (on-pathway oligomers) or in the presence of 200 μ 
M doxycycline (off-pathway oligomers) during 16 h were added to 50 μ 
M of lipid vesicles. Total dye release was 
completed by the addition of 0.1 vol % Triton X-100. The percentage of probe release was calculated as follows:

where IF, IT, and IB are the fluorescence intensity of the dye released by the protein, total dye released, and control
