BMI increase through puberty and
adolescence is associated with risk of adult
stroke
ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate the contribution of prepubertal childhood body mass index (BMI) and BMI
change through puberty and adolescence, 2 distinct developmental BMI parameters, for risk of
adult stroke in men.
Methods: In this population-based study in Gothenburg, Sweden, men born in 1945–1961 with
information on both childhood BMI at age 8 and BMI change through puberty and adolescence
(BMI at age 20–BMI at age 8) were followed until December 2013 (n 5 37,669). Information on
stroke events was retrieved from high-quality national registers (918 first stroke events, 672
ischemic stroke events [IS], 207 intracerebral hemorrhage events [ICH]).
Results: BMI increase through puberty and adolescence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21 per SD increase;
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–1.28), but not childhood BMI, was independently associated
with risk of adult stroke. Subanalyses revealed that BMI increase through puberty and adoles-
cence was associated with both IS (HR per SD increase 1.19; 95% CI 1.11–1.28) and ICH (HR
per SD increase 1.29; 95% CI 1.15–1.46). High BMI increase during puberty was strongly
associated with increased risk of adult hypertension (odds ratio per SD increase 1.35; 95% CI
1.32–1.39).
Conclusions: BMI increase through puberty and adolescence is associated with risk of adult IS
and ICH in men. We propose that greater BMI increases during puberty contribute to increased
risk of adult stroke at least partly via increased blood pressure. Neurology® 2017;89:363–369

Stroke incidence has decreased among older individuals yet it has been increasing among young
adults.1,2 The cause for the increased stroke incidence in young adults is not known, but it
coincides with the obesity epidemic.1,3
A high adult body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for stroke4 and there is strong evidence of
an association between a high BMI in young adulthood and risk of adult stroke in men.5–8 For
prepubertal childhood BMI, there is no clear evidence of an association with adult risk of
stroke.9–11 All these previous studies had only one BMI measurement available and could not
separate the effect of BMI at childhood and the effect of BMI increase through puberty and
adolescence for stroke risk.12
To evaluate the relative contribution of these 2 distinct developmental BMI parameters for
the risk of adult stroke, at least one BMI measurement from each period is required. In the
population-based BMI Epidemiology Study (BEST) in Gothenburg, Sweden, information on
childhood BMI and young adult BMI shortly after puberty has been collected, and linkage
to high-quality Swedish national registers has provided information on outcomes. Using this

 information, we recently demonstrated that
excessive BMI increase during puberty is a risk
marker of adult cardiovascular disease (CVD)
mortality.13
We hypothesize that BMI increase during
puberty might be a risk marker of adult stroke.
The aim with the present study was therefore
to evaluate the relative contribution of child-
hood BMI and BMI increase through puberty
and adolescence as risk markers for adult
stroke.
METHODS Study population. We collected birthweight as
well as directly measured height and weight from centrally
archived School Health Care (SHC) records for all men born
1945 to 1961 in Gothenburg, Sweden (see also e-Methods at
Neurology.org). We also collected height and weight at young
adult age from military conscription tests. Conscription was
mandatory until 2008 for all Swedish men. The study cohort was
linked to high-quality national disease registers using personal
identity numbers (PINs) from the included participants. Eligible
individuals were those with a SHC record in the central archive
and a 10-digit PIN (figure e-1). Participants with data available
for calculation of both childhood BMI and young adult BMI
were included in the present study (n 5 37,669; figure e-1 and
table 1).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. This study was approved by the ethics committee of
the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. There was no commercial
sponsorship.
Exposures. Prepubertal childhood BMI at 8 years of age and
young adult BMI at 20 years of age were calculated using all paired
height and weight measurements in the period between 6.5 and
9.5 years of age for prepubertal childhood BMI, and in the period
17.5–22 years of age for young adult BMI, and age-adjusted using
linear regression models to 8 and 20 years of age, respectively.13
BMI change through puberty and adolescence was defined as the
difference between young adult BMI and childhood BMI.
Childhood overweight ($17.9 kg/m2) and obesity ($20.0 kg/m2)
was defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention cutoff at 8 years of age14 and young adult overweight
and obesity were defined as $25 kg/m2 and $30 kg/m2, respec-
tively. Birthweight was retrieved from SHC records.
Outcomes. Linkage to registers held by the National Board of
Health and Welfare and Statistics Sweden was performed using
the individuals’ 10-digit PIN. Dates and diagnoses for the first
stroke event and first hypertension diagnosis were retrieved from
high-quality national Swedish registers: the National Inpatient
Register (as main diagnosis) and Cause of Death Register (as
underlying cause of death; table e-1).15–17 The National Inpatient
Register, including information on inpatient care diagnoses, was
initiated in 1964 with full coverage in the Gothenburg region
from 1972. The Cause of Death Register includes information on
causes of death since 1961. The stroke events were defined ac-
cording to the International Classification of Diseases system
codes (table e-1). Participants who had a stroke, died, or emi-
grated before age 20 were excluded from the analysis (figure e-1).
The men in the study were followed from 20 years of age until
censoring due to stroke, death, migration, or until December 31,
2013, and were 52–68 years of age on December 31, 2013.
Statistical analysis. We used Cox proportional hazard regres-
sion to analyze the association between exposures and events.
Childhood BMI was log-transformed and standardized and
BMI change through puberty and adolescence was standardized
when used in the Cox regression models. The assumption of
proportionality was confirmed for all variables. Possible inter-
actions were evaluated by addition of an interaction term in the
linear Cox regression models, and p , 0.05 for the interaction
term was interpreted as a statistically significant interaction.
Possible nonlinear associations were evaluated by inclusion of
a quadratic term and by using a restricted cubic spline approach.18
We used logistic regression to analyze the association between
exposures and an adult diagnosis of hypertension. Kaplan-Meier
survival plots, and analyses using restricted cubic splines, were
done in R19 using the survival20 and rms21 packages. For all other
statistical analyses, SPSS version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was
used.
RESULTS Study cohort. In this population-based
study, men born in 1945–1961 with information
on both childhood BMI at age 8 and BMI change
through puberty and adolescence (BMI at age 20–
BMI at age 8) were followed until December 2013

 (n 5 37,669; figure e-1, table 1). Mean follow-up
starting from 20 years of age was 37.6 years
(1,415,973 person-years of follow-up). A total of 918
first stroke events (672 ischemic stroke [IS] events,
207 intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH] events) occurred
before the end of follow-up (table 1). Undetermined
stroke events (n 5 39) were included in stroke events
but not in IS or ICH.
BMI

independently associated with stroke events. In the Cox
proportional hazards models adjusted for birth year
and country of birth, BMI increase through puberty
and adolescence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21 per SD
increase; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–1.28),
but not childhood BMI, was directly associated with
risk of stroke when evaluated separately (table 2).
Similar results were seen when childhood BMI and
BMI change through puberty and adolescence were
included together in the same model (table 2). The
role for childhood BMI and BMI change through
puberty and adolescence were then evaluated for
stroke events divided into IS and ICH. BMI increase
through puberty and adolescence was moderately
associated with IS (HR 1.19 per SD increase; 95%
CI 1.11–1.28) and strongly associated with ICH (HR
1.28 per SD increase; 95% CI 1.14–1.45; table 2),
while childhood BMI was not associated with IS or
ICH (table 2).
Both boys developing overweight during puberty
(HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.41–2.33) and boys who were
overweight
consistently
throughout
childhood/
puberty (HR 1.71; 95% CI 1.22–2.38) had increased
risk of adult stroke compared with boys without
childhood or young adult overweight (table 3). In
contrast, participants who were overweight at 8 years
of age and became normal weight during puberty did
not have increased risk of adult stroke compared with
participants with normal weight both at 8 years and at
20 years of age (table 3). Similar results were seen for
IS and ICH, with the most pronounced effect for the
association between overweight developed during
puberty and ICH (HR 3.03; 95% CI 1.97–4.65;
table 3). The same pattern was also seen in less pow-
ered analyses for obesity, with the strongest associa-
tion seen for participants who developed obesity
during puberty (table e-2). There was no evidence
of a nonlinear association between BMI increase

 through puberty and adolescence and risk of adult stroke
(figure 1), IS (figure e-2A), or ICH (figure e-2B). A
Kaplan-Meier survival plot revealed increased risk of
stroke for participants above the median BMI increase
through puberty and adolescence compared to partici-
pants below the median (p , 0.001, figure e-3). There
was no statistically significant interaction between child-
hood BMI and BMI increase through puberty and ado-
lescence for the association with stroke events.
As expected, young adult BMI was associated with
risk of adult stroke (HR 1.18 per SD increase; 95%
CI 1.11–1.26; table e-3). However, in combined
analysis including both BMI change through puberty
and adolescence and young adult BMI, only BMI
increase through puberty and adolescence was associ-
ated with risk of adult stroke, demonstrating that
BMI increase through puberty and adolescence is
an independent risk marker of stroke (combined anal-
ysis, BMI increase through puberty and adolescence
HR 1.20 per SD increase; 95% CI 1.07–1.35; young
adult BMI HR 1.01 per SD increase; 95% CI 0.90–
1.13; table e-3). Evaluation using cumulative inci-
dence plots of stroke events and nonstroke mortality
did not indicate that there was competing nonstroke
mortality disturbing the present finding of increased
risk of stroke for participants with a BMI change
during puberty above the median compared with par-
ticipants below the median of BMI change during
puberty (figure e-4).
Early and late stroke events. Next we evaluated early
(#55 years of age) and late (.55 years of age) stroke
events separately. These analyses revealed that BMI
increase through puberty and adolescence adjusted
for childhood BMI predicted early stroke (HR 1.22
per SD increase; 95% CI 1.12–1.32) and IS (HR
1.18; 95% CI 1.07–1.30; table 4). Importantly, the
association between BMI increase through puberty
and adolescence adjusted for childhood BMI and risk
of early ICH was substantial (HR 1.35 per SD
increase; 95% CI 1.16–1.56; table 4). BMI increase
through puberty and adolescence was also associated
with late stroke (HR 1.19 per SD increase; 95% CI
1.09–1.30) and IS (HR 1.19 per SD increase; 95%
CI 1.08–1.32; table 4). Thus, greater BMI increase
during puberty was a moderate risk marker of both
early and late adult stroke and IS while it was a sub-
stantial risk marker specifically of early adult ICH.
Sensitivity analysis. In order to control for disease-
related weight loss, we performed sensitivity analy-
ses for the associations with risk of stroke by exclusion
of participants with censoring during the first 10 years
of follow-up (n 5 1,035). Exclusion of the first 10
years of follow-up resulted in similar results for the
association between BMI increase through puberty
and adolescence and risk of adult stroke (HR 1.21 per
SD increase; 95% CI 1.14–1.29, adjusted for child-
hood BMI). We also evaluated a subpopulation
including only boys born in Sweden and with parents
born in Sweden. The described association for BMI
increase through puberty and adolescence with young
adult stroke events was similar in this subpopulation
(n 5 31,404; stroke HR 1.22 per SD increase; 95%
CI 1.14–1.30).
Adjustment for birthweight. Birthweight was available
in a subsample of the present cohort (n 5 35,659).
Additional adjustment for birthweight did not alter
any of the associations. This could be illustrated by
the fact that the association between BMI increase
through puberty and adolescence and stroke was sim-
ilar before (HR per SD increase 1.21; 95% CI 1.14–
1.28) and after (HR per SD increase 1.20; 95% CI
1.13–1.28) adjustment for birthweight. No statisti-
cally significant interaction was seen between birth-
weight and BMI increase through puberty and
adolescence for the association with risk of stroke.
Association with hypertension. As hypertension is
a well-established risk factor for both IS and ICH,
we next evaluated whether or not BMI increase
through puberty and adolescence was associated with
an adult diagnosis of hypertension using a logistic
regression analysis. Interestingly, there was a strong
association between BMI increase through puberty
and adolescence and hypertension (OR 1.36 per SD
increase; 95% CI 1.32–1.40). This association was

DISCUSSION The reason for the recent unexpected
trend of increased stroke incidence among young
adult participants is unknown but it coincides with
the obesity epidemic. We have recently demonstrated
that BMI increase through puberty and adolescence is
an independent predictor of adult CVD mortality.13
However, the relative role of childhood BMI and
BMI increase through puberty and adolescence as risk
markers for adult stroke is unknown.12 We herein
demonstrate that BMI increase through puberty
and adolescence, but not childhood BMI, is associ-
ated with risk of adult stroke and that this is observed
both for IS and ICH.
Using the well-powered BEST Gothenburg Study
with information on BMI both at childhood and in
young adult age, we recently made the observation
that the correlations between childhood BMI and
BMI increase through puberty and adolescence were
only marginal.13 These 2 distinct developmental
BMI parameters therefore have the potential to con-
tribute nonoverlapping information as risk markers
for adult diseases. This notion is supported by our
present finding that BMI increase through puberty
and adolescence, but not childhood BMI, is associ-
ated directly with risk of adult stroke. The role of
BMI increase through puberty and adolescence as
a risk marker of adult stroke was illustrated by the
fact that boys developing overweight during puberty,
but not boys with childhood overweight that
normalized during puberty, had increased risk of
adult stroke compared with boys without childhood
or young adult overweight.
The present finding that young adult BMI pre-
dicts risk of adult stroke confirms the results from sev-
eral
previous
studies.5–8,13,22
Importantly,
our
combined models including both BMI increase
through puberty and adolescence and young adult
BMI revealed that only BMI increase through
puberty and adolescence independently associated
with risk of adult stroke, demonstrating that BMI
increase through puberty and adolescence is an inde-
pendent risk marker for adult stroke.
In a recent study, BMI was analyzed both in chil-
dren at 3–19 years of age and later in the same par-
ticipants at 30–40 years of age and the relative
contribution of these 2 BMI parameters for adult
CVD risk factors was evaluated. In that study, obese
adults had increased risks of hypertension and carotid
artery atherosclerosis regardless of BMI status during
childhood and the risk of these outcomes among
overweight or obese children who became nonobese
by adulthood were similar to those among persons
who were never obese. These findings indicate that
childhood BMI status does not contribute beyond
adult BMI status to adult risk of CVD,23 supporting
the present study that BMI increase through puberty
and adolescence but not childhood BMI is associated
with risk of adult stroke. However, in the study by
Juonala et al.,23 it was not possible to determine the
association specifically for BMI change through
puberty and adolescence as the childhood BMI mea-
surement for a majority of the participants was not

 performed before onset of puberty but rather during
puberty and the adult BMI measurement was per-
formed up to about 25 years after puberty. In addi-
tion, the study did not have enough statistical power
to evaluate stroke events.
Subanalyses in the present study revealed that the
direct association between BMI increase through
puberty and adolescence and risk of adult stroke
was the result of an association with both risk of IS
and ICH. A large BMI increase during puberty was
a moderate risk marker of both early (,55 years of
age) and late ($55 years of age) adult IS while it was
a substantial risk marker specifically of early adult
ICH. Although IS and ICH to some extent have
separate risk factors, high blood pressure is a major
risk factor for both diseases24 and interventions that
target hypertension are believed to reduce 75% of the
excess risk of stroke associated with a high BMI in
adults.25 Interestingly, greater BMI increase during
puberty was, in the present study, a strong predictor
of an adult diagnosis of hypertension, suggesting that
high blood pressure might be a mediating factor for
the association between BMI increase through
puberty and adolescence and risk of adult stroke.
We speculate that a contributing reason for the
recent unexpected increased stroke incidence among
young adult participants might be caused by a secular
trend of more pronounced BMI increase during
puberty. The observational nature of our study pre-
cludes making conclusive statements about the
observed associations but our findings can be useful
for hypothesis generation. Based on our findings in
the present study, we hypothesize that avoiding exces-
sive BMI increase during puberty might reduce the
risk of adult stroke and that one should consider
monitoring adult blood pressure in men with exces-
sive BMI increase during puberty.
The strengths of the present study include the
large size of the cohort, the extended adult follow-
up, the possibility to adjust for birthweight, and the
population-based nature of the cohort. In addition,
the Swedish national disease registers are of recog-
nized high quality, which permits a near-complete
follow-up of participants in the study and their diag-
noses as reported by the health care provider.15,26,27
The study is well-powered and it is therefore possible
to identify relatively small effects. An important lim-
itation of the present study is that no information on
childhood socioeconomic factors or education is
available for the included men born as early as in
1945–1961. Furthermore, we could not control for
several important risk factors (e.g., smoking, exercise,
and serum levels of blood lipids) or for BMI at middle
age. The present cohort includes primarily Caucasian
men and, therefore, the results may have limited gen-
eralizability to other ethnicities. The age interval of
the present cohort was 52–68 years at the end of
follow-up (December 31, 2013) and thus stroke risk
later in life could not be studied. It should be empha-
sized that since the present cohort was born in 1945–
1961, the prevalences of obesity are lower (1.3% at 8
years of age and 0.9% at 20 years in the present
study), while the corresponding figures in more
recent years are higher, 7.9% at 8 years of age28 and
3.8% at age 20 in a study from the military service
conscription register.29 Thus the present study pre-
dates the childhood obesity epidemic and today’s obe-
sogenic
environment may
further
enhance the
observed associations with adult stroke events.
BMI increase through puberty and adolescence is
associated with risk of adult IS and early adult ICH in
men. We propose that high BMI increase during
puberty might cause increased risk of adult stroke at
least partly via increased blood pressure.
