 There is a deep mistrust of psychiatry fostered by reports
suggesting that psychotropic drug efficacy is very small. Kirsch
et al concluded that antidepressants should only be used in
severely ill patients;1 the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors in
Alzheimer’s disease and of lithium prophylaxis in bipolar disorder
has been questioned;2,3 and we found a smaller antipsychotic
drug–placebo difference in schizophrenia than we intuitively
expected.4 These reviews inspired an article in The New Yorker
summarising them,5 and fuelled a vocal antipsychiatry move-
ment.6,7 Psychiatrists, patients, caregivers and the press are
unsettled by these findings and some may think that psychiatric
medication is not worth the bother. But is this small efficacy really
true, and what about other medical interventions? As medicine is
becoming highly specialised, few psychiatrists are familiar with
the evidence of general medicine and psychiatric drugs. In this
context we reviewed the efficacy of psychiatric pharmacotherapy
in the perspective of standard medical drugs, making this paper
the first attempt to provide a panoramic overview of major drugs.
It is not possible to compare qualitatively different outcomes in

the
percentages of patients helped with a drug or placebo, keeping
in mind the differences in outcome for the mere purpose of
perspective. We hasten to add a warning not to be overly concrete
and to interpret this review as a qualitative perspective and not as
a comparison. Therefore we discuss major factors that need to be
taken into account in the interpretation of clinical trials and
systematic reviews.
Method
Identification of diseases of interest
and search strategy
We
reviewed
textbooks,8,9
identified
common
diseases
by
consensus (S.L., S.H. and J.M.D.) based on frequency, importance
and available treatment, and consulted national and international
guidelines to identify primary treatments. We hand-searched the
Cochrane Library, and searched Medline combining MeSH terms
for the medical and psychiatric disorders with the MeSH term for
meta-analysis (no time or language limit, last search May 2009)
and references of included reports for systematic reviews of
randomised controlled trials that applied meta-analysis and
compared monotherapy of these treatments with placebo.
We first excluded meta-analyses of studies of subgroups (e.g.
elderly people) and chose reviews of classes of drugs rather than
single drugs (e.g. any antipsychotic, rather than only haloperidol)
if available, based on the assumption that the original reviewers
had made an appropriate decision to pool the drugs. We then
chose the most recent reviews, because even if methodologically
better an older review would have certainly been out of date. This
was a conservative decision, because old meta-analyses in
psychiatry usually had higher effect sizes (see Discussion and
online Table DS1). The rare exceptions were slightly older meta-
analyses that reported the indices necessary for our analysis more
completely. These usually were Cochrane reviews which were

Putting the efficacy of psychiatric and general
medicine medication into perspective: review
of meta-analyses
Stefan Leucht, Sandra Hierl, Werner Kissling, Markus Dold and John M. Davis
Background
The efficacy of psychopharmacological treatments has been
called into question. Psychiatrists are unfamiliar with the
effectiveness of common medical drugs.
Aims
To put the efficacy of psychiatric drugs into the perspective
of that of major medical drugs.
Method
We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library for systematic
reviews on the efficacy of drugs compared with placebo
for common medical and psychiatric disorders, and
systematically presented the effect sizes for primary efficacy
outcomes.
Results
We included 94 meta-analyses (48 drugs in 20 medical
diseases, 16 drugs in 8 psychiatric disorders). There were
some general medical drugs with clearly higher effect sizes
than the psychotropic agents, but the psychiatric drugs were
not generally less efficacious than other drugs.
Conclusions
Any comparison of different outcomes in different diseases
can only serve the purpose of a qualitative perspective. The
increment of improvement by drug over placebo must be
viewed in the context of the disease’s seriousness, suffering
induced, natural course, duration, outcomes, adverse events
and societal values.

 preferred in case of doubt, because they use similar methodology
and always fully report the data. To corroborate these decisions we
always compared different reviews for consistency of results and
contacted authors in the rare case that the results were discrepant.
(These additional reviews are quoted in the footnotes of the tables
in the online data supplement.) The quality of the included
systematic reviews was evaluated with the AMSTAR score (range
of possible values 0–11).10 Only primary efficacy outcomes in
the areas of interest according to the treatment guidelines were
extracted.
Statistical analysis
For continuous outcomes we extracted effect sizes and their 95%
confidence intervals, presented both as differences in original units
(mean difference) and as standardised mean differences (SMD).
Mean differences were calculated according to the general formula
(mean group A)7(mean group B), e.g. 75 kg in the drug group
minus 70 kg in the placebo group gives a mean difference in body
weight of 5 kg. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) provide a
difference in standard deviation units (mean group A7mean
group B) / standard deviation, e.g. (75770) / 10 = 0.50, using the
values from the previous example.
For dichotomous outcomes we presented the percentage of
participants improved in the drug and placebo groups, the
absolute risk/response difference (ARD; % responder drug – %
responder placebo); the relative risk reduction (RRR; 1 – (% risk
drug / % risk placebo) or relative response (RR) ratio (%
responder drug / % responder placebo); and the number needed
to treat (NNT), with their 95% confidence intervals. We also
presented the P value, the number of studies and participants
included and the average study duration (see online Table DS2
for a detailed description of these parameters).
Where our five standard parameters (mean difference, SMD,
ARD, RRR, RR, NNT) were not reported in the studies, we
transformed the existing data, or re-calculated meta-analyses by
entering single study results using Review Manager version 5.0
or Comprehensive Meta-analysis version 2 for Windows.11,12 S.H.
ran the searches, S.H. and S.L. selected the reports. S.H. extracted
the
data,
S.L.
independently
verified
them,
disagreements
were resolved by J.M.D. and W.K., and M.D. rated the AMSTAR
score.
Results
The Medline searches yielded 6175 abstracts and we hand-
searched 1830 titles of Cochrane reviews – see online Figs DS1–
24 for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-analyses (PRISMA) diagrams of the selection process.13
We included 94 meta-analyses of 48 drugs in 20 medical diseases
(median AMSTAR score 9.0, 95% CI 8.2–9.2) and 33 meta-
analyses
of
16
drugs
in
8
psychiatric
disorders
(median
AMSTAR score 8.0, 95% CI 6.9–8.9). In the text we systematically
present the raw numbers (for dichotomous outcomes the
percentage responders in the placebo and drug groups; for
continuous outcomes the average mean difference) and the
average effect size (ARD and RRR/RR for dichotomous outcomes,
SMD for continuous outcomes). Tables 1 and 2 present only some
examples. Online Tables DS3 and DS4 present a comprehensive
list including number of studies/participants, numbers needed
to treat, P values and confidence intervals for each outcome and
each intervention. A positive sign means that a drug either
increased a positive outcome (e.g. response) or reduced a negative
outcome (e.g. relapse). All the effect sizes in online Tables DS3 and
DS4 are presented in Fig. 1 to give the overall gestalt. For this
purpose, effect sizes for dichotomous outcomes (ARD, RR/RRR)
were converted to SMDs in Comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.12,14
This figure corresponds to online Fig. DS25 which indicates which
dot relates to which study or outcome. Figures DS26 and DS28
present the same gestalt for relative and absolute risk/responder
differences.
Medical disorders
In Tables 1 and DS3 the data are presented in an abbreviated
‘participants – intervention – comparator – outcome’ (PICO)
format (the comparator is always placebo or no treatment).
Hypertension: antihypertensives for reduction of blood pressure,
prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality
Several drug classes yielded similar results (Table DS3). Combining
all agents, blood pressure was reduced by 9.4 mmHg systolic and
5.5 mmHg diastolic in the short term (SMDs 0.54 and 0.56
respectively).15 In the long term all drug classes significantly
reduced cardiovascular events, e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors reduced such events from 18% to 14% (ARD
4%, RRR 22%).16 A significant reduction of mortality has not
been shown for all of them (Table DS3).

Summary of effect sizes.
All effect sizes in online Tables DS3 and DS4 are presented except for duplicates
(e.g. effect size on dichotomous response and continuous reduction of severity in
schizophrenia). Online Fig. DS25 identifies which dot corresponds to which result, and
Figs DS26–29 present the results of dichotomous outcomes as relative and absolute
risk/responder differences. Data on older meta-analyses from Table DS1 are not
included. Effect sizes of dichotomous outcomes were converted to standardised
mean differences expressed as Hedges’ g. Effect sizes of general medicine
medication are presented on the left-hand side (median 0.37, mean 0.45, 95%
CI 0.37–0.53) and psychiatric drugs on the right-hand side (median 0.41, mean 0.49,

 Leucht et al
Acute ischaemic stroke: thrombolysis, aspirin and heparin
for prevention of death or dependency
Thrombolysis reduced death or dependency from 56% to 51%
(ARD 5%, RRR 9%),17 but when administered after 4.5 h
mortality is increased by haemorrhages.18 Aspirin reduced death
or dependency from 46% to 45%,19 whereas heparin was
ineffective.20
Cardiovascular disease: aspirin for primary and secondary
prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality
In secondary prevention, low-dose aspirin reduced serious
cardiovascular events per year from 8.2% to 6.7% (ARD 1.5%,
RRR 19%) and vascular mortality per year from 4.1% to 3.7%
(ARD 0.29%, RRR 9%, P= 0.05).21 In primary prevention, aspirin
reduced the number of cardiovascular events per year from 0.57%
to 0.51%, but there was no effect on mortality because the
reduction of occlusive events was balanced by an increase in major
bleeds (mortality per year: placebo 0.19%, drug 0.19%).21
Hypercholesterolaemia: statins for reduction of cholesterol levels
and prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality
In the short term, statins reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol by 1.54 mmol/l or 31%.22 In the long term, cardio-
vascular events were reduced from 18% to 14% (primary and
secondary prevention combined, ARD 4%, RRR 21%) and 5-year
mortality from 9.7% to 8.5%.23
Chronic heart failure: various drugs for reduction of mortality
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor
blockers,
beta-blockers
and
diuretics
respectively
reduced
mortality rates from 27% to 23% (ARD 4%, RRR 15%), from
18% to 11%, from 13% to 8% and from 12% to 3%.24–27 Digitalis
significantly reduced hospital admission (from 33% to 25%) but
not mortality.28
Rheumatoid arthritis: antirheumatic drugs for the reduction
of tender joints
Various immunosuppressants, corticosteroids and other agents
reduced the number of tender joints with reasonably good SMDs
between 0.33 and 1.33 (raw values for mean differences were not
presented; Table DS3).29,30
Acute migraine: effects of sumatriptan and aspirin
on the number of patients pain-free after 2 h
Sumatriptan increased the percentage of patients pain-free after
2 h from 9% to 30% (ARD 20%, RR 220%)31 and intravenous
aspirin increased it from 15% to 27%.32
Prophylaxis of migraine: effects of propanolol and anticonvulsants
on responder rates and on the number of migraine attacks
Fifty-two per cent responded to propanolol prophylaxis and 31%
to placebo (ARD 35%, RR 80%).33 Patients had approximately one
migraine attack less (SMD 0.47).33 The results of anticonvulsants
were similar.34
Chronic asthma: effects of inhaled corticosteroids
and beta-2-agonists on forced expiratory volume
and on asthma exacerbations
The first-line drugs for chronic, severe asthma are inhaled
corticosteroids and beta-2-agonists (short-acting as needed,
long-acting in patients with refractory disease).35 Inhaled cortico-
steroids increased forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) by
330 ml (SMD 0.56).36 The addition of long-acting beta-2-agonists
improved FEV1 by 190 ml (SMD 0.35),37 but the reduction of
asthma exacerbations found by some meta-analyses is contro-
versial,36,38 because another meta-analysis found more severe
exacerbations.39
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: effects of various agents
on FEV1 and on disease exacerbations
Guidelines
recommend
anticholinergics,
beta-2-agonists
and
inhaled
corticosteroids.40
The
anticholinergic
tiotropium
improved FEV1 by 200 ml (SMD 0.99).41 It reduced exacerbations
from 31% to 23% (ARD 5%, RRR 17%).41 Inhaled corticosteroids
improved FEVl by 100 ml (SMD 0.36) and the number of
exacerbations per patient and year by 0.26 (SMD 0.20).42 The data
on long-acting beta-2-agonists are equivocal. They reduced
exacerbations (e.g. Salpeter et al),43 but one systematic review
found them to increase respiratory deaths.43
Type 2 diabetes: various antidiabetics for reduction of HbA1c
and mortality
Metformin reduced HbA1c by 1% (SMD 0.97) and a-glucosidase
inhibitors reduced it by 0.8% (SMD 0.64).44,45 In the long term,
metformin reduced the death rate from 22% to 15% (ARD 7%,
RRR 32%),44 but a-glucosidase inhibitors have not been shown
to change the death rate.45
Hepatitis C: effects of interferon and ribavirin on virological
response/morbidity and mortality
Interferon increased the number of participants with no detectable
virus at treatment end (virological response) from 1% to 38%
(ARD 35%, RR 1070%).46 Ribavirin was only efficacious in
combination with interferon.47
Reflux oesophagitis: proton pump inhibitors for clinical remission
and relapse prevention
Proton pump inhibitors are highly effective in acute treatment
(response: placebo 28%, drug 83%, ARD 58%, RR 256%),48 and
also in maintenance treatment (relapse: placebo 75%, drug
36%).49
Ulcerative colitis: 5-aminosalicylic acid for clinical remission
and maintenance of remission
Five-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) increased remission from 10%
with placebo to 20% (ARD 8%, RR 70%),50 and maintenance of
remission from 37% to 53% (ARD 18%, RR 50%).51
Multiple sclerosis: corticosteroids for treatment of acute episodes
and interferon for prevention of exacerbations
Acute treatment with corticosteroids increased the proportion of
responders from 28% with placebo to 68% (ARD 41%, RR
140%).52 In the first 2 years, prevention with interferon beta
reduced exacerbations from 70% to 55% (ARD 14%, RRR 19%).53
Parkinson’s disease: effects of levodopa on disease symptoms
There was no systematic review of the standard treatments
levodopa or dopamine agonists with data compared with placebo.
We parenthetically note that the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline based its recommendation
on a pivotal 42-week trial in which levodopa produced 7 points
more improvement in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating

dopamine nerve terminal loss.55
Breast and lung cancer: polychemotherapy for reduction of mortality
Breast cancer is the most frequent neoplasm in women and lung
cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Polychemotherapy
reduced the 15-year breast cancer mortality in younger women
(550 years) from 42% to 32% (ARD 10%, RRR 24%) but in
older women only from 50% to 47%.56 Tamoxifen added to
polychemotherapy reduced the 15-year mortality in oestrogen
receptor-positive patients from 35% to 26%.56 In the study by Bria
et al, adjuvant chemotherapy led to a small reduction of 5-year
lung-cancer mortality (ARD 3%, RRR 9%),57 confirming a
landmark previous meta-analysis.58
Infectious diseases: antibiotics for rhinosinusitis, otitis media,
uncomplicated cystitis and prophylaxis of wound infection
after surgery
The effects of antibiotics depend on the infection. We did not find
meta-analyses on severe infections such as pneumonia or on
antivirals (monotherapy v. placebo) for HIV. A meta-analysis
concluded against their general use in rhinosinusitis owing to
small effect size (response: placebo 57%, drug 64%, ARD 7%,
RRR 13%).59 The use of antibiotics in otitis media is debated,
as within 2–7 days 78% of patients recovered spontaneously
compared with 84% taking antibiotics (ARD 6%, RR 28%).60 In
contrast, the efficacy in uncomplicated cystitis (response: placebo
26%, drug 62%) and for the prophylaxis of wound infections after
major operations (infections: placebo 39%, antibiotics 10%) was
clear.61,62
Psychiatric disorders
Full data are given in Table DS4; examples are summarised in
Table 2.
Schizophrenia: antipsychotics for reduction of overall symptoms
and relapse prevention
In acute treatment, second-generation antipsychotics increased
the percentage responding from 24% with placebo to 41%
(ARD 18%, RR 70%), and reduced the Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scale/Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score by 9/10
points
(SMD
0.51).4
Antipsychotic
maintenance
treatment
reduced relapse rates from 57% to 22% within approximately 10
months (ARD 38%, RRR 65%).63
Bipolar disorder: mood stabilisers for acute mania, antidepressants
for depression and mood stabilisers for relapse prevention
Various antimania agents increased the percentage responding
from approximately 30% with placebo to approximately 50%
within 3 weeks (response to lithium 52% v. placebo 34%, ARD
17%, RR 50%;64 response to valproate 47% v. placebo 21%,
ARD 27%, RR 150%;65 response to carbamazepine 51% v. placebo
26%, ARD 25%, RRR 100%;65 response to antipsychotics 50% v.
placebo 31%, ARD 20%, RR 60%).66 In bipolar depression,
antidepressants increased the response rate from 34% to 58%
(ARD 34%, RR 130%).67 In maintenance treatment, lithium
reduced relapse rates from 81% to 36% (ARD 53%, RRR
51%),68 or from 61% to 40% after excluding studies in which
lithium was suddenly discontinued (ARD 24%, RRR 35%).69
Major depressive disorder: antidepressants for acute depression
and relapse prevention
The absolute responder differences in recent meta-analyses of
various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (or tricyclic
antidepressants used as an active comparator in SSRI v. placebo
studies)70 v. placebo in major depressive disorder were 10–15%
(Table DS4). For example, paroxetine increased the percentage
responding from 42% to 53% (ARD 10%, RR 20%) and reduced
the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score by 3 points
(SMD 0.32).71 These studies were currently primarily conducted
in out-patients with less severe disorder (e.g. 90% of the sample
were out-patients in the meta-analysis by Barbui et al).71
Maintenance treatment with any antidepressant reduced the
relapse rate from 41% with placebo to 18% (ARD 23%, RRR
58%),72 consistent with another meta-analysis restricted to new
antidepressants (placebo 48% v. drug 26%, ARD 22%, RRR
44%).73
Obsessive–compulsive disorder: effects of SSRIs on responder
rates and overall symptoms
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increased the proportion of
patients responding in the acute phase from 23% to 43% (ARD
20%, RRR 84%).74 These drugs reduced the mean Yale–Brown

reduction of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms
(raw differences in rating scale scores or responder rates were

Discussion
Any comparison of treatments for different diseases can only be
qualitative in nature and therefore Fig. 1 is no more than a way
to place psychiatric drugs in the perspective of general medicine
medication. Some general medical drugs have very high effect
sizes, but those obtained by psychiatric drugs are in the same
range as most general medical pharmacotherapeutics. This said,
the increment of improvement by a drug must be viewed in the
context of the seriousness of the disease, the suffering induced,
the outcome in question, societal values and the natural course
including the duration of the disease. In the following paragraphs
we discuss a number of these issues which readers should take into
account in interpreting the results.

 Psychiatric drugs in perspective
Outcomes
Psychiatry is often criticised for using rating scales which are
subjective and considered ‘soft’ outcomes, whereas many medical
treatments prevent ‘hard’ outcomes such as death or major events
(stroke, heart attack, etc.). High blood pressure or cholesterol
levels per se do not lead to suffering, therefore they should not
be the primary outcome, rather their long-term consequences.
Sometimes an intermediate outcome is improved but mortality
increases; for example, in a large multicentre effectiveness trial
for asthma (n = 26 000), long-acting beta-2-agonists increased
respiratory-related deaths.80 In diabetes, aggressive glycaemic
control reduced glucose levels compared with standard care, but
increased mortality rates (n = 10 251).81
Other drugs reduce the symptoms and suffering originating
directly from the disease such as oesophagitis or migraine, but
their pathophysiological disease processes do not progress to
death. Psychiatric drugs fall in this category. Therefore, reduction
of disease severity (e.g. degree of delusions and hallucinations in
schizophrenia) and prevention of future episodes are primary
outcomes, and it is not entirely appropriate to criticise psychiatry
for using ‘soft’ outcomes. This said, there is considerable room for
improvement in psychiatric outcome measures,82 and death or
suicide should be always reported. The example of lithium shows
that some psychiatric drugs may reduce suicide rates.83,84
Placebo effects
Readers may be surprised that many effect sizes in both areas were
not larger. The median of all effect sizes was 0.40, similar to that
found in another analysis of Cochrane reviews (0.32).85 In this
context there is a general misconception that with placebo all
patients will have a poor outcome, but many patients will recover
spontaneously owing to the natural course of the disorder (for
example, a manic episode will remit by itself) and placebo effects.
Effect sizes for dichotomous and continuous
outcomes
For dichotomous outcomes both relative and absolute risk
reductions should be considered. There is substantial evidence
showing that clinicians tend to overestimate treatment effects
presented as relative risk reductions.86 For example, statins
reduced
cardiovascular events from approximately
18%
to
approximately
14%.23
The
relative
risk
reduction
of
22%
((17(0.14/0.18))6100) is more impressive than the absolute risk
difference of 4% (14% – 18% = |–4%|). On the other hand, if the
risk in the placebo group is low, the maximally possible absolute
risk reduction must be lower than the base rate (here 18%),
making the relative risk reduction more important.
In continuous outcomes the standardised mean difference
(Cohen’s d, Hedges’ g, etc.) is necessary when different instruments
are used to measure the same concept (e.g. two depression scales)
or if the original unit is difficult to interpret intuitively (e.g. the
score of an unknown rating scale). As the SMD is relative to
the pooled standard deviation, large variability will reduce it.
In psychiatry this often occurs with rating scales in somewhat
ill-defined, ‘variable’ diseases such as depression, whereas in
general medicine the measure may be a highly accurate laboratory
test (e.g. serum cholesterol concentration) in a well-defined
disease entity. Cohen’s rule that an SMD of 0.2 is a small effect
size, 0.5 medium and 0.8 a large effect size is often used, but
Cohen hastened to say that the interpretation depends on the
context;87 a small SMD for a fatal disease is more important than
a large SMD for a transitory rash. In the future, quality-adjusted
life years (QALYs) could be a uniform measure for comparisons
across treatments, but these are not yet available for all drugs
and we did not find this outcome in the meta-analyses. In
addition, there is much debate about the validity of QALYs (see,
for example, studies by Schlander88 and Griebsch et al89).
Sample size
Meta-analyses in somatic medicine sometimes include impressively
large patient numbers, e.g. 95 000 participants in studies of the
primary prevention of cardiovascular events with aspirin.21
Aspirin reduced the risk of a cardiovascular event from 0.57%
per year to 0.51% per year. Angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors
for
hypertension
reduced 5-year mortality
from
10.4% to 9.2% in 18 229 participants.16 In such situations, large
sample sizes are needed for two reasons: first, the aspirin v.
placebo difference was 0.07% event and the ACE inhibitors v.
placebo difference was 1.2% events, requiring large sample sizes
for statistical significance; second, the base rate (equivalent to
the risk in the placebo group) was very low (e.g. 0.57% per year
without aspirin), limiting the drug effect to a maximum 0.57%
per year. Nevertheless, for mortality even a small difference can
be
clinically
meaningful.
In
psychiatry
the
difference
in
percentages of those responding to drug or placebo is usually
higher and it has been shown that here meta-analyses with at least
1000 participants are robust.90
Drug effects could accumulate over time
The mean duration of the studies included in a meta-analysis
should always be considered. For example, treated or not, few
patients with hypertension will die in the course of a year. Thus,
to obtain a large difference in mortality, studies of many years’
duration would be necessary, but such studies are almost
impossible to conduct for many reasons. Therefore, shorter
studies are performed which show only small differences.
Although only very long-term studies could prove this, it is likely
that the reduction of mortality accumulates over time. In this
context, many psychiatric drugs not only improve the acute
episode but also prevent further episodes. Patients with severe
recurrent depression might have 20 episodes in their lifetime,
which could be reduced by medication to 10.72
Has drug efficacy decreased over the decades?
To be systematic we generally chose the most up-to-date systematic
reviews, but there is an impression that earlier meta-analyses in
psychiatry yielded higher effect sizes (see online Table DS1 for
some examples). In the first 103 double-blind studies in
depression,
summarised
in
1993,
approximately
two-thirds
responded to tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine esterase
inhibitors compared with a third responding to placebo.91 The
large National Institute of Mental Health schizophrenia trial,
published in 1964, reported that 69% responded to antipsychotics
and 24% to placebo (NNT 2, effect size 1.31).92 In the first large
obsessive–compulsive disorder trial, published in 1991, half the
sample responded to clomipramine and only 5% to placebo.93
Recent meta-analyses found much smaller effect sizes for both
the new SSRIs and clomipramine.94 The reasons for decreasing
effect sizes are not entirely understood. The early trials were often
small and single-centre, and methodology less well developed
(blinding, scales, external auditing, statistical methods). There
may also have been more publication bias, as efforts to control
it have expanded only in the past two decades. Modern trials
are often large, multicentre studies but have other problems such
as the impossibility of recruiting severely ill patients with truly
acute disorders because of ethical concerns, the availability of
effective
medication
leaving
few
drug-naive
patients,
and
the phenomenon of symptomatic volunteers answering an
103
 Leucht et al
advertisement for free medication and thereby increasing placebo
response.95 It is possible that there are similar temporal trends
in general medicine and the phenomenon needs thorough
examination.
Limitations
We made a considerable effort to be systematic, but for the reasons
stated below we could not meet all criteria of a systematic review.
We did not examine a single drug but put different medications in
perspective, for which an established methodology does not exist.
First, we could not present a complete collection, but we chose
common diseases by consensus based on frequency, importance
and available treatment. It would be difficult to operationalise
the selection. For example, there are diseases that are frequent
but not severe (an extreme example is the common cold). Others
are extremely severe but rare (e.g. certain cancers). The selection
was made a priori, and once chosen all diseases and drugs were
presented. We feel that the selection is representative and that
the major diseases of the industrialised world are included;
nevertheless, the selection process may have introduced bias.
Second, in the selection among reviews, we emphasised up-to-
dateness and full presentation, but we compared the results of
different meta-analyses on the same topic which were usually
consistent. Third, a review of reviews is observational by nature:
our unit of analysis was published meta-analyses, which does
not exist for all drugs/indications, and the included reports
differed in the exact methods, publication dates, inclusion criteria,
etc. Fourth, many meta-analyses did not present the data in a
consistent manner, resulting in a major challenge for us. We made
substantial efforts to present the results in a consistent way by
back-calculating indices, but stringent following of the PRISMA
statement would facilitate future attempts.13
Fifth, we did not address side-effects. These are a serious
problem of many psychotropic drugs, although improvements
have been made. For example, SSRIs have much less serious
toxicity than tricyclic antidepressants. General medicine drugs also
have important side-effects, for example death induced by
bleeding from thrombolysis or aspirin or cancer chemotherapies.
It would have been simply impossible to describe side-effects as
well and to balance them with efficacy, because there are many
subjective judgement calls. Finally, publication bias is a major
problem for meta-analyses. For example, Turner et al (see Table
DS4) showed that the inclusion of unpublished antidepressant
trials reduced the effect size.96 Publication bias exists in general
medicine as well (see, for example, Rising et al),97 and we are
not aware of evidence comparing its degree in different fields.
There are many reasons why doctors, patients and caregivers
are and should be critical about psychotropic drug treatment, such
as unclear disease aetiology, lack of diagnostic tests, commercial
conflict of interest, unclear mechanism of drug action and side-
effects. Moreover, some people think that psychiatric disorders
are purely psychological conditions that should be treated
exclusively
with
psychotherapy.
However,
the
efficacy
of
psychotropic drugs is supported by randomised controlled trials.
In this context we have put psychiatric drugs in the perspective
of general medicine medication.
