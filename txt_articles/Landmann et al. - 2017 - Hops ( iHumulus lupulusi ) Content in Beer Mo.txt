Abstract
Aim: Using a binge-drinking mouse model, we aimed to determine whether hops (Humulus lupu-
lus) in beer is involved in the less damaging effects of acute beer consumption on the liver in com-
parison with ethanol.
Methods: Female C57BL/6 J mice were either fed one iso-alcoholic and iso-caloric bolus dose of
ethanol, beer, beer without hops (6 g ethanol/kg body weight) or an iso-caloric bolus of maltodex-
trin control solution. Markers of steatosis, intestinal barrier function, activation of toll-like receptor
4 signaling cascades, lipid peroxidation and lipogenesis were determined in liver, small intestine
and plasma 2 h and 12 h after acute alcohol ingestion.
Results: Alcohol-induced hepatic fat accumulation was significantly attenuated in mice fed beer
whereas in those fed beer without hops, hepatic fat accumulation was similar to that found in
ethanol-fed mice. While markers of intestinal barrier function e.g. portal endotoxin levels and lipo-
genesis only differed slightly between groups, hepatic concentrations of myeloid differentiation
primary response gene 88, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and plasminogen-activator
inhibitor 1 protein as well as of 4-hydroxynonenal and 3-nitrotyrosine protein adducts were simi-
larly elevated in livers of mice fed ethanol or beer without hops when compared with controls.
Induction of these markers was markedly attenuated in mice fed hops-containing beer.
Conclusion: Taken together, our data suggest that hops in beer markedly attenuated acute
alcohol-induced liver steatosis in female mice through mechanisms involving a suppression of
iNOS induction in the liver.
INTRODUCTION
Alcohol-related liver diseases are among the most frequent diseases
associated with high chronic alcohol intake (Rehm et al., 2014).
However, epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of
different kinds of alcoholic beverages might have different effects on
the liver. For instance, results of others suggest that the consumption
of hard spirits may be more harmful to the liver in regards to the
risk of developing cirrhosis than the consumption of fermented bev-
erages like wine or beer (Becker et al., 2002; Kerr and Ye, 2011).
However, data are still contradictory as results of some studies also

 reported no differences between the consumption of different types
of alcoholic beverages and the risk to develop liver cirrhosis in heavy
drinkers (Pelletier et al., 2002). Furthermore, mechanisms and cofac-
tors involved in the proposed less harmful effects of a high intake of
wine and beer versus that of hard spirits have also not yet been fully
clarified (e.g. the role of drinking habits, secondary plant com-
pounds and others).
Beer is one of the most frequent consumed alcoholic beverages
worldwide (WHO, 2014). Recently, using a binge-drinking model in
female and male mice, we reported that acute intake of beer has less
damaging effects on the liver than a comparable intake of plain
ethanol (Kanuri et al., 2014; Landmann et al., 2015). In these stud-
ies, the less damaging effects of beer were associated with a protec-
tion against the induction of toll-like receptor (TLR)-4- and
inducible nitric oxide synthase- (iNOS) dependent signaling cascades
in the liver. In line with these findings, results obtained in human
intervention studies using alcohol-free beer suggest that regular
intake of alcohol-free beer can promote anti-oxidative capacity
(Franco et al., 2013) and is associated with improved lipid profiles
but also lower markers of oxidative stress in elderly women
(Martinez Alvarez et al., 2009). Furthermore, consumption of
alcohol-free beer protected rats from adriamycin-induced heart and
liver toxicity due to a reduction of markers of lipid peroxidation in
the liver (Valls-Belles et al., 2008). In vitro and in vivo studies using
isolated beer constituents like xanthohumol and iso-acids have been
shown to attenuate hepatic inflammation and even fibrosis (Dorn
et al., 2012) as well as to suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
inflammation (Desai et al., 2009). However, in most of these studies,
compounds were applied in doses that cannot be reached with mod-
erate or even high beer intake. Starting from this background, the
aim of the present study was to further delineate the role of hops
(Humulus lupulus), one of the main ingredients in beer, in the less
damaging effects of acute high beer consumption when compared
with acute intake of plain ethanol on mouse livers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and treatments
All procedures were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (Jena, 02-061/13). Six- to eight-weeks-old female
C57BL/6J mice (n = 6–9 per group, Janvier S.A.S, France) were kept
in a standard pathogen-free barrier facility accredited by the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care with free access to standard pellet chow (Ssniff, Germany) and
tap water at all times. Female mice were used as it had been shown
before that female mice but also women are more susceptible to
alcohol-induced liver damage (Becker et al., 1996; Wagnerberger
et al., 2013). At the day of the experiment, mice received one single
dose of either iso-caloric and iso-alcoholic (6 g ethanol/kg body
weight (b.w.)) ethanol solution, normal beer with hops or specially
brewed beer without hops (EKU Pils, Kulmbacher Brauerei AG,
Germany). Controls were fed an iso-caloric maltodextrin solution.
Alcoholic and iso-caloric maltodextrin control solutions were pre-
pared as detailed previously (Kanuri et al., 2014). Alcohol doses used
did not cause mortality; however, mice were sluggish but conscious
and regained normal behavior within ∼5–6 h after alcohol feeding.
During the first half hour, animals were closely observed and after-
wards at least every 30 min until sacrifice. Animals were sacrificed 2
and 12 h after acute treatment, respectively, and tissue was harvested
as detailed before (Kanuri et al., 2014).
Liver histology and clinical markers of liver damage as
well as plasma endotoxin and alcohol levels
Accumulation of hepatic triglycerides and staining of lipids with Oil
Red O were carried out as described in detail previously (Spruss
et al., 2012b). Representative pictures of staining were taken at
×200 magnification using a Leica microscope (DM4000 B LED,
Leica, Germany). In addition, formalin-fixed liver tissue was sec-
tioned (4 µm) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to
evaluate liver histology.
Alcohol and endotoxin levels in portal plasma of mice were mea-
sured as described previously (Wagnerberger et al., 2013). Levels of
alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST) in portal
plasma were measured at the Institute for clinical chemistry and
laboratory diagnostics (Architect, Abbott GmbH & Co. KG,
Germany) at the University Hospital of Jena.
RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR
RNA was isolated with Trizol (Peqlab, Germany) and reverse tran-
scribed (cDNA synthesis kit, Promega, Germany). Relative mRNA
expression was quantified using a MX QPCR System (Agilent
Technologies, Germany) using a SybrGreen Mix and 2-step PCR
protocol as recommended by Agilent Technologies. The comparative
CT method was used to determine the amount of target genes, nor-
malized to an endogenous reference (18S) and relative to a calibra-
tor (2−ΔΔCt). Primers for the detection of acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ACC), carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), fatty acid synthase
(FAS), perilipin-2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gam-
ma (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1c,
TLR-4 and 18 S were designed using Primer 3 software and synthe-
sized at Eurofins MWG Operon (Eurofins, Germany). Primer
sequences are listed in Supplemental Material 1.
Immunostaining of myeloid differentiation factor 88
and iNOS, as well as 4-hydroxynonenal and
3-nitrotyrosin protein adducts in liver tissue
and occludin in the small intestine
Using polyclonal primary antibodies (3-nitrotyrosin (3-NT): Santa-
Cruz Biotech, Germany; 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE): AG Scientific,
USA; iNOS: Affinity BioReagents, USA; myeloid differentiation fac-
tor 88 (MyD88): Santa-Cruz Biotech, Germany; Occludin: Life
Technologies, Germany) immunostainings of MyD88, iNOS and
occludin protein as well as 3-NT and 4-HNE protein adducts were
performed in liver and small intestinal tissue as previously described
(Arteel, 2003; Spruss et al., 2012b; Kanuri et al., 2015). The extent
of labeling in liver lobules and small intestine, respectively, was
defined as percent of the field area within the default color range
determined by a software using an image acquisition and analysis
system incorporated in the microscope (DM4000 B LED, Leica,
Germany). Data from eight fields of each tissue section (×200 mag-
nification) were used to determine means.
Western blot
To analyze phosphorylation status of inhibitor kappa B alpha
(IκBα) and protein levels of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) as well
as cytochrome P450 2 E1 (CYP2E1), western blot analysis was per-
formed as previously described (Kanuri et al., 2014; Engstler et al.,
2015). Primary antibodies against IκBα and pIκBα (Cell Signaling
Technology, Germany) as well as ADH and CYP2E1 (ADH: Cell
Signaling Technology, Irvine, CA, USA; CYP2E1: Enzo Life Science

 Inc., Germany) were used. Bands were analyzed densitometrically
using a ChemiDoc MP System (BioRad Laboratories, Germany)
and in the case of ADH and CYP2E1 normalized to band intensity
of β-actin (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). All blots
were stained with Ponceau Red (Roth, Germany) to ensure equal
loading.
Detection of apolipoprotein B, total glutathione, nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells,
plasminogen-activator inhibitor and tumor necrosis
factor alpha
Protein levels of apolipoprotein B (ApoB), plasminogen-activator
inhibitor (PAI-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in total
liver lysates were determined via commercially available ELISA
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits and NFκB (nuclear factor
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) p65 protein activity
as well as total glutathione (GSH) protein were determined following
the instructions of the manufacturer (ApoB: Cloud-Clone Corp, USA;
GSH: Cayman Chemicals, USA, NFκB: Active Motif, La Hulpe,
Belgium, PAI-1: Loxo GmbH, Germany; TNFα: IBL International
GmbH, Hamburg).
Statistical analyses
Data are shown as mean + standard error of mean (SEM) unless
indicated otherwise. To determine significant differences, one-way
analysis of variances with the post hoc test of Tukey was used
(GraphPad Prism Software, USA). A P-value of <0.05 was consid-
ered as significantly different. Grubbs test was used to identify out-
liers (GraphPad Prism Software, USA).
RESULTS
Effect of beer with or without hops on blood alcohol
levels and hepatic fat accumulation 2 and 12 h after
ingestion
Two hours after acute ingestion of ethanol or beer, plasma ethanol
levels of mice fed ethanol or beer were significantly increased (+2.5–
2.8-fold) when compared with maltodextrin-treated controls with
no
significant
differences
between
alcohol-treated
groups
(see
Table 1). Ethanol concentrations in plasma were still slightly ele-
vated 12 h after acute ingestion in all three alcohol-fed groups when
compared with controls (+1.4–1.7-fold in comparison with controls,
n.s.). Protein levels of ADH and CYP2E1 in liver did not differ
between groups (see Table 1 and Supplemental Material 2 for repre-
sentative pictures). Lipid accumulation as detected by Oil Red O
staining, quantification of triglycerides and mRNA expression of
perilipin-2 were significantly higher in livers of mice fed plain etha-
nol when compared with controls but also in comparison with mice
fed normal beer (lipids: +~6.5-fold compared with controls and
+~1.3-fold compared with beer-fed mice; triglycerides: +~12.8-fold
compared with controls and +~2.2-fold compared with beer-fed
mice, perilipin-2: +~4.7-fold compared with controls and +~1.7-
fold compared with beer-fed mice, P < 0.05; Fig. 1). However, lipid
and triglyceride concentrations as well as perilipin-2 mRNA expres-
sions in livers of beer-fed mice were still markedly higher than in
livers of control mice (lipids: +5.1-fold, P < 0.05; triglycerides:
+5.8-fold, P = 0.15; perilipin-2: +2.3-fold, P < 0.05; Fig. 1). In con-
trast, lipid and triglyceride concentrations but also perilipin-2
mRNA expressions in livers of mice fed beer without hops were
similarly elevated than in mice fed plain ethanol. Despite these find-
ings, 12 h after ingestion of ethanol or beer, plasma ALT activities
did not differ between groups as data varied considerably in some
groups. In contrast, plasma AST activities were significantly higher
than those of controls in all three alcohol-fed groups. Furthermore,
AST plasma activities of mice fed beer without hops were even high-
er than those of mice fed beer with hops (Table 1).
Effect of beer with and without hops on markers of
lipogenesis, PAI-1 protein and lipid export in the liver
12 h after ingestion
In line with our previous findings, 12 h after acute alcohol inges-
tion, expression of SREBP-1c mRNA was significantly lower in
livers of all three alcohol-fed groups regardless of the type of bever-
age consumed when compared with maltodextrin controls (Kanuri
et al., 2014). Expression of FAS mRNA was also lower in livers of
mice fed plain ethanol or the beers 12 h after ingestion; however,
as data varied considerably only the differences between mice fed
plain ethanol and controls reached the level of significance. Neither
mRNA expression of ACC nor CPT-1 or PPARγ in the liver dif-
fered
between
groups
12 h
after
acute
alcohol
ingestion.
Furthermore, 12 h after ingestion of ethanol or the beers, PAI-1
protein concentration was significantly higher in livers of mice fed
plain ethanol (P < 0.01 when compared with controls, P < 0.001
when compared with beer-fed animals). A similar effect was not
found in livers of animals fed beer without hops when compared
with controls; however, PAI-1 protein levels in livers of these mice
were significantly higher than in beer-fed mice (P < 0.05, Table 2).
In contrast, protein levels of ApoB were slightly but not signifi-
cantly higher in livers of mice fed plain ethanol and the different
beers, respectively, when compared with control animals (Table 2).

 Effect of beer with and without hops on markers of

activation, lipid peroxidation as well as NFκB activation
2 and 12 h after ingestion
Two hours after acute ingestion of ethanol or beer with and without
hops, respectively, occludin protein concentration in the small intes-
tine was only significantly lower in duodenum of mice fed beer with
hops and by trend in ethanol-fed animals (P = 0.08) when compared
with controls (Table 3 and Supplemental Material 3 for representa-
tive pictures). In contrast, endotoxin levels in portal plasma were
significantly increased in animals fed beer without hops in compari-
son with all other groups (Table 3). Protein concentrations of
MyD88 were significantly higher in livers of mice fed plain ethanol
and beer without hops when compared with controls and for the lat-
ter also in comparison with mice fed beer with hops. In contrast,
MyD88 protein levels did not significantly differ between mice fed
beer with hops and controls. In line with these findings, iNOS pro-
tein levels and concentrations of 3-NT and 4-HNE protein adducts
were all significantly higher in livers of mice fed plain ethanol and
beer without hops in comparison with controls and in case of 4-
HNE protein adducts also in comparison with mice fed normal
beer. Furthermore, neither hepatic concentration of iNOS protein
nor 3-NT and 4-HNE protein adducts were significantly induced in
mice fed normal beer when compared with controls (Fig. 2 and
Supplemental Material 4 for representative pictures). Concentration
of total GSH was significantly lower in livers of mice fed plain

 ethanol or beer without hops when compared with mice fed beer
with hops or controls, while total GSH concentration in liver did
not differ between controls and mice fed beer with hops. However,
ingestion of ethanol and beer with or without hops had no marked
effects on nuclear NFκB p65 activity, the phosphorylation status of
IκBα or TNFα protein concentration in the liver of mice 12 h after
acute ingestion (see Table 3 and Supplementary Material 2 for rep-
resentative pictures of the western blot).
DISCUSSION
Results of several epidemiological studies suggest that chronic con-
sumption of fermented alcoholic drinks like beer in comparison with
spirits is associated with lower liver disease-associated mortality
(Becker et al., 2002; Kerr and Ye, 2011). However, data determin-
ing the effect of whole beer and beer lacking certain ingredients (e.g.
hops) on the development of liver damage under controlled condi-
tions are limited. Therefore, we aimed to delineate the effects of
hops content in beer on the liver using a binge-drinking mouse
model. Neither signs of drunkenness and plasma alcohol levels nor
hepatic ADH and CYP2E1 protein or plasma transaminase activity
differed between alcohol-fed groups. However, in line with our pre-
vious findings (Kanuri et al., 2014), fat accumulation in the liver of
beer-fed mice was markedly lower than in those of ethanol-fed ani-
mals. In contrast, in livers of mice fed beer without hops steatosis
was similarly to that found in mice fed plain ethanol. Taken
together, our data suggest that hops content in beer is at least in
part responsible for the less damaging effects of beer on the liver in
settings of acute elevated consumption of alcohol in mice.
In line with previous studies (Kanuri et al., 2014) expressions of
SREBP-1c and FAS mRNA were lower in livers of all alcohol-fed
groups. Furthermore, expression of ACC, CPT-1 and PPARγ, all
being involved in regulating triglyceride synthesis and lipogenesis in
the liver (Rogue et al., 2010; Zardi et al., 2013), was similar between
groups, too. Differences between our results and those of others
might have resulted from differences in the models used (in vitro
studies (You et al., 2002) vs. in vivo studies in the present study) and
the experimental setup. Indeed, it has been shown before in male
mice that the induction of SREBP-1c but also FAS in the presence of
ethanol underlies a time-dependent regulation and may be influenced
by bioavailability of fatty acids (Wada et al., 2008). Therefore, in the
present study, the induction of SREBP-1c and PPARγ but also other
markers of lipogenesis and fatty acids synthesis might have been
missed. Taken together, our data suggest that the less harmful effects
of the ingestion of beer containing hops on the liver after acute inges-
tion did not primarily stem from hops-induced alterations of hepatic
SREBP-1c- and PPARγ-mediated lipogenesis.
In the present study, protein levels of the tight-junction protein
occludin, suggested before to be critical in alcohol-induced intestinal
barrier dysfunction (Elamin et al., 2012), were similar between
groups. Two hours after alcohol ingestion, portal endotoxin levels
of mice fed plain ethanol and beer with or without hops were mark-
edly higher than those of controls, with alcohol- and beer with
hops-fed groups not differing. These data suggest that the less harm-
ful effects of beer with hops on the liver might not have resulted

 from changes at the levels of intestinal barrier function. However, as
we only studied protein levels of the tight-junction protein occludin
and endotoxin plasma levels 2 h after acute intake of alcohol we
might have missed the point of time when marked changes in these
markers occurred. Indeed, results of others suggest that transloca-
tion of bacterial endotoxin in rats appeared rather quickly e.g.
~30 min after acute ingestion of alcohol while erosions of intestinal
barrier were only observed ~4 h after ingestion (Tamai et al., 2000).
However, despite no marked changes in occludin protein levels,
protein concentrations of MyD88 and iNOS as well as of 4-HNE
and 3-NT were markedly induced in animals receiving either plain
ethanol or beer without hops. In line with previous in vivo and
in vitro results (Kanuri et al., 2014), in livers of normal beer-fed ani-
mals the induction of both markers was markedly attenuated, sug-
gesting that hops in beer at least in part may attenuate the induction
of hepatic MyD88 and iNOS expression in mice. In line with these
findings and those of others (Cao et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016),
concentration of total GSH was markedly lower in livers of mice fed
plain ethanol and beer without hops, respectively. However, neither
activity of NFκB, phosphorylation status of IκBα nor protein con-
centration of TNFα was altered between groups. This effect on
TNFα expression is in line with previous studies (Wagnerberger
et al., 2013; Kanuri et al., 2014) and might have resulted from the
time-dependent regulatory release of TNFα shown before in in vitro
experiments (Spencer et al., 2013; Maraslioglu et al., 2014).
However, the induction of PAI-1 protein shown before to be regu-
lated through iNOS- and TNFα-dependent signaling pathways
(Bergheim et al., 2006; Spruss et al., 2012a) was also markedly atte-
nuated in livers of mice fed normal beer whereas in livers of mice
fed beer without hops this effect on PAI-1 expression was not quite
as pronounced. However, ApoB protein levels shown to be regu-
lated through PAI-1- and c-Met-dependent signaling pathways
(Bergheim et al., 2006) were almost similar between groups. The
lack of responsiveness of ApoB protein in the present study when
compared with earlier studies might have resulted from gender dif-
ferences, the detection time point or methods used (Bergheim et al.,
2006; Landmann et al., 2015). Taken together, our data suggest
that hops in beer attenuated the induction of MyD88 and iNOS in

 an acute setting of alcohol ingestion thereby leading to a lower for-
mation of reactive oxygen species and induction of PAI-1 and subse-
quently suppressed acute alcohol-induced liver damage.
CONCLUSION
Results of our study lend further support to the hypothesis that con-
sumption of fermented alcoholic beverages like beer may be less
harmful for the liver than consumption of hard spirits. Furthermore,
our results suggest that hops in beer may at least in part suppress
the induction of iNOS and lipid peroxidation in the liver. However,
which compound(s) in hops is/are responsible for the less damaging
effects of hops-containing beer found in the present study and which
molecular mechanisms are involved but also whether these effects
are found in chronic settings and humans, too, will have to be deter-
mined in future studies.
