Association Between Intensive Care Unit Utilization
During Hospitalization and Costs, Use of
Invasive Procedures, and Mortality
Dong W. Chang, MD, MS; Martin F. Shapiro, MD, PhD
IMPORTANCE Maximizing the value of critical care services requires understanding the
relationship between intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, clinical outcomes, and costs.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether hospitals had consistent patterns of ICU utilization across
4 common medical conditions and the association between higher use of the ICU and hospital
costs, use of invasive procedures, and mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of 156 842 hospitalizations
in 94 acute-care nonfederal hospitals for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pulmonary embolism
(PE), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and congestive heart failure (CHF) in
Washington state and Maryland from 2010 to 2012. Hospitalizations for DKA, PE, UGIB, and
CHF were identified from the presence of compatible International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Multilevel logistic regression models
were used to determine the predicted hospital-level ICU utilization during hospitalizations for
the 4 study conditions. For each condition, hospitals were ranked based on the predicted ICU
utilization rate to examine the variability in ICU utilization across institutions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were associations between
hospital-level ICU utilization rates and risk-adjusted hospital mortality, use of invasive
procedures, and hospital costs.
RESULTS The 94 hospitals and 156 842 hospitalizations included in the study represented
4.7% of total hospitalizations in this study. ICU admission rates ranged from 16.3% to 81.2%
for DKA, 5.0% to 44.2% for PE, 11.5% to 51.2% for UGIB, and 3.9% to 48.8% for CHF.
Spearman rank coefficients between DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF showed significant correlations
in ICU utilization for these 4 medical conditions among hospitals (ρ � 0.90 for all
comparisons; P < .01 for all). For each condition, hospital-level ICU utilization rate was not
associated with hospital mortality. Use of invasive procedures and costs of hospitalization
were greater in institutions with higher ICU utilization for all 4 conditions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For medical conditions where ICU care is frequently provided,
but may not always be necessary, institutions that utilize ICUs more frequently are more likely
to perform invasive procedures and have higher costs but have no improvement in hospital
mortality. Hospitals had similar ICU utilization patterns across the 4 medical conditions,
suggesting that systematic institutional factors may influence decisions to potentially
overutilize ICU care. Interventions that seek to improve the value of critical care services will
need to address these factors that lead clinicians to admit patients to higher levels of care
when equivalent care can be delivered elsewhere in the hospital.

O
ptimizing the utilization of intensive care units (ICUs)
is an important health care priority in the United
States. Overuse of ICUs for patients who can likely re-
ceive equivalent care in non-ICU settings may lead to inva-
sive, potentially harmful, care and decrease access for pa-
tients for whom critical care services may be beneficial. In
addition, US critical care services consume 13.4% of total hos-
pitalcostsand4.1%ofnationalhealthexpenditures;boththese
costs and the number of ICU beds are rising.1-3 The potential
clinical consequences of overusing ICU care along with the
rapidgrowthandhighcostshavemadeimprovingitsvaluecru-
cial for the viability of the US health care system.1,4
Central to improving value is identifying patients who de-
rive the most benefit from critical care services and reducing
variation in ICU admission practices that do not translate to
improved clinical outcomes. However, lack of clear-cut guide-
lines for ICU admissions and differences in institutional re-
sources, policies, and culture have resulted in significant vari-
ability in utilization among hospitals.2,5,6
Previous studies have shown that for diabetic ketoacido-
sis(DKA),pulmonaryembolism(PE),andcongestiveheartfail-
ure (CHF), there is wide hospital-level variation in utilization
of critical care services without a change in mortality.5-7 How-
ever, these studies were limited to single diseases, making it
challenging to determine whether the variability is due to nu-
anced institutional differences in disease management or due
to systematic factors related to overall ICU use. Determining
whether variation in ICU utilization stems from disease-
specific or institutional factors is an important step in devel-
oping interventions to reduce unwanted variation.
Some conditions, such as acute respiratory failure and sep-
ticshock,arenearlyuniversallyrecognizedasrequiringICUad-
mission in the absence of an advanced directive to limit inten-
sity of care. Other conditions, such as cellulitis or deep venous
thrombosis, rarely require the ICU, and few patients are trans-
ferredthere.Forstillotherconditions,thepotentialneedforand
benefits from ICU care may be subject to variable opinions and
practices. We studied 4 such medical conditions to examine
(1)variabilityinICUutilizationacrosshospitals,(2)whetherhos-
pitals are more likely to use ICU services for all 4 conditions or
whether there is significant variability within hospitals in level
ofICUuseacrossdiseases,and(3)theassociationbetweenhos-
pitalsthatuseICUcaremorefrequentlyandhospital-levelmor-
tality,useofinvasiveprocedures,andhospitalcostsforeachcon-
dition. We hypothesized that some hospitals utilize ICU care
more frequently across multiple diseases and that this in-
creased utilization is not associated with decreased mortality.
Methods
This study was approved by the institutional review board at
the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, waiving writ-
ten informed consent.
Data Source and Study Population
Data were obtained from the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality’
s Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State In-
patient Databases for Washington and Maryland.8 Hospital
characteristics were obtained by linking the databases with the
Healthcare Cost Report Information System.9 Additional de-
tails regarding these databases are provided in eMethods in
the Supplement.
This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients (age
≥18 years) hospitalized for DKA, PE, upper gastrointestinal
bleeding (UGIB), and CHF from 2010 through 2012. Hospital-
izations for each disease were identified based on compatible
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clini-
cal Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes as the principal diagnosis
that was present at admission. The ICD-9-CM codes used to de-
fine the cohorts with DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF were consis-
tent with previous studies that have examined these diseases
using administrative data and are provided in eMethods in the
Supplement.5,6,10-15
There were 4 104 720 hospitalizations in 217 hospitals in
the database during the study period. Hospitalizations were
excluded from analysis if patients were younger than 18 years
(n = 635 412), if they were hospitalized in facilities without ICU
beds (n = 125 127; 113 hospitals), or information on hospital-
level characteristics was missing (n = 4699; 10 hospitals), leav-
ing 3 339 482 total hospitalizations in 94 hospitals available for
analysis.
Study Variables
ICU Admission
The proportion of hospitalizations with ICU stays at each hos-
pital was identified using the presence of ICU or coronary care
unit room and board charges in the revenue codes (eMethods
intheSupplement).Underthisapproach,thetimingofICUcare
(whether on admission or later during the hospitalization) was
not available.
Outcomes and Adjustment Variables
The primary outcomes were risk-adjusted hospital-level mor-
tality, use of invasive procedures, and hospital costs. We ex-
amined use of central venous catheters in all 4 medical con-
ditions and mechanical ventilation in DKA, thrombolytics in
PE, esophagogastroduodenoscopy in UGIB, and pulmonary ar-
terycatheterizationinCHF.Utilizationoftheseproceduresand
Key Points
Question Do hospitals have similar patterns of intensive care unit
(ICU) utilization across 4 common medical conditions, and is
increased ICU utilization associated with better clinical outcomes?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study, 94 hospitals were
ranked by their predicted ICU utilization rates for diabetic
ketoacidosis, pulmonary embolism, upper gastrointestinal
bleeding, and congestive heart failure, and consistent patterns
were found across all 4 conditions. Hospitals that used ICUs more
frequently were more likely to perform invasive procedures and
have higher costs but have no improvement in mortality.
Meaning Optimizing the value of ICU care will require
assessments of systematic institutional factors that may lead
clinicians to overutilize ICU care.

therapies was identified by the presence of corresponding ICD-
9-CM codes (eMethods in the Supplement).5,10,16,17 Variables
for risk adjustment included patient factors (age, race, sex,
payer status, median income by zip code, comorbid condi-
tions, and number of organ system failures) and hospital fac-
tors (number of beds, teaching status, percentage of hospital
beds designated as ICU beds, and ICU occupancy). Comorbid
conditions were identified using discharge data codes to cal-
culate a Charlson Comorbidity Index.18-20 Organ system fail-
ures were identified by the presence of ICD-9-CM codes cor-
responding to respiratory, circulatory, renal, neurologic,
hematologic, and hepatic failures as defined by Angus et al.21
Cost of hospitalization was calculated from total charges using
hospital-specificcost-to-chargeratiosandadjustedto2012dol-
lar values using the medical component of the Consumer Price
Index.22,23
Statistical Analysis
To assess variation in ICU admission rates across hospitals,
we created hierarchical mixed-effects logistic regression
models to estimate the odds of having an ICU admission in
hospitalizations for DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF in each hospi-
tal. We adjusted for patient- and hospital-level effects by
adding adjustment variables as fixed effects and used indi-
vidual hospitals as the random effect to account for cluster-
ing of hospitalizations within hospitals. Using empirical
Bayesian posterior estimates from these logistic regression
models, we determined the predicted ICU utilization rate
(risk- and reliability-adjusted) and 95% CIs for each hospital
during hospitalizations for DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF.24-26 For
each condition, hospitals were ranked based on the pre-
dicted ICU utilization rate. The ranges of these rates were
used to examine the variability in ICU utilization across hos-
pitals. We studied whether hospitals had consistent patterns
of ICU utilization by examining the correlation between ICU
utilization rates for DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF among hospi-
tals using the Spearman rank correlation.
We calculated risk-adjusted hospital-level mortality rates
for each condition using empirical Bayesian posterior esti-
matesfromaseparatesetofmultilevellogisticregressionmod-
els using hospital mortality as the dependent variable. Patient-
level adjustment variables were included as fixed effects, and
individual hospitals as random effects to account for cluster-
ing of hospitalizations. We used a parallel approach to calcu-
late risk-adjusted use of invasive procedures and therapies for
each hospital in all 4 conditions. Similarly, we used multi-
level linear regression models to calculate risk-adjusted hos-
pital-level lengths of stay and costs for each condition. We log-
transformed lengths of stay and costs prior to creating linear
regression models owing to their nonnormal distributions.
The relationships between ICU admission rate (as a con-
tinuous variable) and hospital mortality, use of invasive pro-
cedures, and total costs were examined using linear regres-
sion analyses.27,28 In addition, the study outcomes were also
comparedafterhospitalsweredichotomizedintohigher(above
50th percentile for predicted ICU utilization rate) and lower
(50thpercentileandbelow)ICUutilizationgroupsforeachcon-
dition. These dichotomized analyses were performed be-
cause the results from these analyses have more intuitive clini-
calinterpretations.AlldataanalyseswereperformedusingJMP
software, version 11.0 (SAS Institute Inc), and SAS for Win-
dows, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
After exclusions, there were 94 acute-care hospitals with ICUs
inWashingtonstateandMarylandduringthestudyperiodwith
156 842 hospitalizations for the 4 study conditions, represent-
ing 4.7% of total hospitalizations in these institutions (Table 1).
The median ICU admission rates for lower vs higher utiliza-
tion hospitals were 43.6% and 67.2%, respectively, for DKA,
12.2% and 26.5% for PE, 23.4% and 34.2% for UGIB, and 9.6%
and 28.7% for CHF (Table 2). Hospitalizations with ICU stays
for these 4 conditions represented 7.8% of ICU hospitaliza-
tions in these institutions. For each condition, smaller hospi-
tals (fewer hospital beds) were more frequently in the higher
ICU utilization group (Table 2). Hospital and ICU occupancy
were similar between the higher and lower ICU utilization
groups for each condition (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Teach-
ing hospitals were more frequently in the higher utilization
groups for each condition (Table 2).
Patient characteristics for DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF hos-
pitalizations stratified by higher and lower ICU utilization
groups and whether the hospitalization included an ICU stay
are listed in Table 1. The distributions of age, sex, race, payer
status, and median incomes were similar between the higher
and lower ICU utilization groups for each condition (eTable 1
intheSupplement).WiththeexceptionofDKA,thereweregen-
erally more comorbidities among ICU hospitalizations in lower
utilization hospitals (Table 1). There were more organ system
failures among ICU hospitalizations in lower utilization insti-
tutions for each condition (Table 1). The distributions of co-
morbidities and organ system failures among non-ICU hospi-
talizations between the lower and higher ICU utilization
hospitals for DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF were similar (Table 1).
Hospital-Level Variability in ICU Hospitalizations
Risk-adjustedICUadmissionratesvariedsubstantiallyforeach
condition (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Adjusted mean ICU
admission rates for hospitals ranged from 16.3% to 81.2% for
DKA, 5.0% to 44.2% for PE, 11.5% to 51.2% for UGIB, and 3.9%
to48.8%forCHF(eFigure1intheSupplement).Spearmanrank
coefficients (ρ) showed extremely high correlations between
ICU utilization rates for DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF among hos-
pitals (ρ ≥ 0.90 for all comparisons, with 1.0 representing per-
fect correlation of ranks; P < .01 for all comparisons). Risk-
adjusted ICU admission rates for DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF in
each hospital are listed in eTable 4 in the Supplement.

Congestive heart failure
Increased utilization of the intensive care unit (ICU) was not associated with
significant differences in hospital mortality for any of the 4 study conditions
(diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA], pulmonary embolism [PE], upper gastrointestinal
bleeding [UGIB], and congestive heart failure [CHF]). The slopes of the linear
regression analyses between hospital mortality and ICU utilization were
−0.0013% mortality per percent predicted ICU admission for DKA (P = .22);
0.0061% for PE (P = .59), −0.0061% for UGIB (P = .49), and 0.0083% for CHF

utilization groups were 0.30% and 0.26% for DKA, 2.85% and
2.98%forPE,2.08%and2.03%forUGIB,and2.99%and3.02%
for CHF (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
With respect to intensity of care delivery, the slopes of the
linear regression analyses between ICU utilization and cen-
tral venous catheter use showed that increased ICU utiliza-
tion was associated with higher central venous catheter use
for each condition (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Similar re-
lationships were seen between ICU utilization and use of all
otherinvasiveprocedures(eFigure3intheSupplement).When
hospitals were dichotomized to higher and lower utilization
groups, rates of invasive procedures in all 4 conditions were
greater in higher ICU utilization hospitals (eTable 5 in the
Supplement). Hospital mortality rates and use of invasive in-
terventions in higher and lower ICU utilization groups strati-
fied by hospitalizations with and without ICU stays are listed
in eTable 3 in the Supplement.
Hospital Costs and Length of Stay
Increased ICU use was associated with higher costs for DKA,
PE, UGIB, and CHF (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). The slopes
of the linear regression analyses between ICU utilization and
costs were $33.85 per percent predicted ICU admission for DKA
(P < .001), $30.18 for PE (P = .02), $29.89 for UGIB (P = .01),
and $97.83 for CHF (P < .001) (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
The respective adjusted costs of hospitalization for institu-
tions in lower and higher ICU utilization groups were $7141 and
$8204 for DKA, $10 660 and $11 117 for PE, $10 164 and $10 851
for UGIB, and $10 175 and $13 587 for CHF (eTable 5 in the
Supplement). Lengths of stay were similar between lower and
higher ICU utilization hospitals for each condition (eTable 5 in
the Supplement). Total costs and length of stay in the higher
and lower ICU utilization groups stratified by hospitaliza-
tions with and without ICU stays are listed in eTable 3 in the
Supplement.
Discussion
Overuse of ICUs among patients who can likely be treated in
non-ICU settings may lead to inappropriately aggressive care
and misallocation of resources away from patients who may
trulyneedcriticalcareservices.Theseclinicalconcerns,aswell
as the high cost and resource utilization of critical care ser-
vices, make it imperative to identify the clinical situations for
whichpatientsderivethemostbenefitwhenreceivingICUcare.
Our findings reflect the clinical challenge of identifying pa-
tients who benefit most from ICU admission and show signifi-
cant variability in ICU utilization during hospitalizations for
DKA,PE,UGIB,andCHF,despiteadjustingforpatient-andhos-
pital-level risk factors. The medical conditions in our study fre-
quently require physicians to make clinical judgments regard-
ing whether ICU admission is necessary, and our findings
provide insight into clinical practices for ICU utilization among
patients who may or may not require ICU care. We found a con-
sistent pattern of ICU utilization among institutions across
these conditions, suggesting that systematic institutional fac-
tors strongly influence clinicians’decisions to utilize the ICU.
Our finding that in higher ICU utilization institutions, pa-
tients with ICU hospitalizations generally had fewer medical
comorbidities and organ system failures suggests that their
higher ICU utilization is not merely a reflection of caring for
sicker patients. Instead institutional factors, such as num-
bers of ICU beds, nurse-to-patient ratios, protocols within non-
ICU settings, and possibly even physician practice styles, likely
contribute to greater propensity to utilize ICU care. The ap-
parentvariabilityinpropensityforICUutilizationsuggeststhat
greater standardization of ICU admission practices might de-
crease costs, improve outcomes, and thus increase the value
of critical care services. As such, a key question is what are the
implications of greater ICU utilization for overall utilization of
invasive and costly procedures, total hospital costs, and clini-
cal outcomes?
We found that hospitals utilizing ICU care more often were
more likely to perform invasive procedures overall on hospi-
talized patients for each condition studied. We also found that
hospitalization costs were higher in institutions using ICU care
more frequently, after controlling for patient factors. Yet, de-
spite providing greater intensity of care at higher costs, higher
utilization hospitals did not differ in hospital mortality rates
for DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF compared with lower ICU utili-
zation institutions. If higher ICU utilization hospitals theoreti-
cally were to change their utilization patterns and lower their
costs of hospitalization to match those of lower ICU utiliza-
tion hospitals, the estimated cost savings for Washington and
Maryland during the study period would be approximately $8
million for DKA, $3.5 million for PE, $6 million for UGIB, and
$120 million for CHF. These estimates do not include certain
cost factors, such as physician charges, which are also higher
among ICU admissions. Furthermore, it is likely that there are
other medical conditions for which overutilization of ICU ser-
vices results in no significant difference in mortality and leads
to more aggressive and costly health care delivery. Our find-
ings are therefor likely conservative estimates of the poten-
tial to reduce costs and improve value through improve-
ments in ICU utilization.
Our findings are consistent with studies by Gershengorn
et al,6 Admon et al,5 and Safavi et al,7 who showed wide varia-
tions across hospitals in ICU use for DKA, PE, and CHF, respec-
tively, without significant differences in mortality. Studies by
these investigators and others have reported mixed results
about the relationship between ICU utilization and costs.5,29-31
Differencesbetweenthesestudiesandourfindingsmaybedue
to differences in analytic methodologies and in populations
studied. Our finding of consistent institutional patterns of ICU
utilization across multiple conditions suggests that system-
atic institutional factors that lead clinicians to admit patients
to the ICU more frequently should be explored as areas for in-
terventions to improve the efficiency of ICU utilization, espe-
cially among higher-use institutions. However, our findings
must also be interpreted in the context of recent findings by
Valleyandcolleagues,30whoreportthatinelderlypatientshos-
pitalized with pneumonia and whose indications for critical

rioration and mortality are higher, greater utilization of ICUs
may be beneficial. For conditions like those examined in our
study, where mortality rates are substantially lower and the
need to escalate care is less frequent, it may be more appro-
priate to be selective with ICU utilization. Taken together, our
findingsandthesepreviousstudiessuggestthatpriortoimple-
menting institutional interventions to improve efficiency of
ICU care, it is imperative that we identify the spectrum of clini-
cal conditions for which higher ICU utilization improves clini-
cal outcomes.
There are some limitations to our study related to the
sources of data. First, administrative databases lack the
granularity to fully adjust for medical complexity; residual
confounding affecting the likelihood of ICU admission and
mortality is likely to exist. Second, use of administrative
codes may be relatively insensitive to identifying certain
invasive procedures, such as central venous catheteriza-
tions, and could also potentially miss some hospitalizations
and ICU admissions for the conditions studied.16,17 Third, the
database does not allow examination of other outcomes
besides hospital mortality because there is no information
on posthospitalization outcomes or care. Examining these
outcomes using data sources with more granular clinical
information and approaches that can track patients after
they leave the hospital will be important areas for further
study. Finally, our findings do not explain the underlying
mechanisms that drive hospitals to use ICUs more often.
Studies that gather more detailed clinical information as well
as information on policies and processes of care and profes-
sional attitudes to treatment will be needed to identify root
causes and develop the most effective interventions to
reduce unwarranted ICU use. In particular, hospital policies
and institutional protocols in non-ICU settings that lead to
overutilization of ICU care should be examined because they
provide feasible opportunities for improvement.
Conclusions
In summary, hospitals that utilized ICU care more frequently
for DKA, PE, UGIB, and CHF were more likely to perform in-
vasive studies and have higher hospital costs with no improve-
ment in mortality compared with lower ICU utilization insti-
tutions. These findings suggest that optimizing ICU utilization
may improve quality and value of ICU care, but accomplish-
ing that will require institutional assessments of factors that
lead clinicians to admit patients to the ICU for cases in which
that level of care may not be necessary.
