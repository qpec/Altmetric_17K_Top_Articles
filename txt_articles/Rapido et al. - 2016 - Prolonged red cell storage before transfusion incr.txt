Introduction
Red blood cell transfusion, the most common procedure performed 
on hospitalized patients (1), is an indispensable component of 
modern medicine. Establishing an adequate blood supply depends 
on the ability to store donated red cells safely. The US FDA allows 
refrigerated storage of red cells for up to 42 days before transfusion. 
The FDA-approved red cell storage duration is not based on evi-
dence of clinical safety or effectiveness, but was derived from stan-
dards set before the advent of clinical outcome studies (2). During 
refrigeration, red cells undergo multiple physiologic changes, col-
lectively called the red cell “storage lesion” (3). The storage dura-
tion that produces a storage lesion sufficiently severe to increase 
transfusion-related morbidity or mortality is unknown. Further-
more, no identified components of the storage lesion reliably pre-
dict the clinical consequences of transfusing an individual red cell 
unit. After animal and observational human studies suggested that 
transfusions of older, refrigerator storage–damaged red cells were 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality (4), several ran-
domized controlled trials compared transfusion of “fresher” with 
“standard practice” or “older” red cells (4–8). None of these trials 
found clinically significant outcome differences when comparing 
transfusions of red cells stored for shorter (~1 week) or longer (~2 
to 5 week) periods. Critically, neither these trials nor others now in 
progress specifically examine the risks associated with transfusing 
red cells after 35 to 42 days of storage (4). In the US, approximately 
BACKGROUND. Some countries have limited the maximum allowable storage duration for red cells to 5 weeks before 
transfusion. In the US, red blood cells can be stored for up to 6 weeks, but randomized trials have not assessed the effects of 
this final week of storage on clinical outcomes.
METHODS. Sixty healthy adult volunteers were randomized to a single standard, autologous, leukoreduced, packed red cell 
transfusion after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks of storage (n = 10 per group). 51-Chromium posttransfusion red cell recovery studies 
were performed and laboratory parameters measured before and at defined times after transfusion.
RESULTS. Extravascular hemolysis after transfusion progressively increased with increasing storage time (P < 0.001 for linear trend 
in the AUC of serum indirect bilirubin and iron levels). Longer storage duration was associated with decreasing posttransfusion red 
cell recovery (P = 0.002), decreasing elevations in hematocrit (P = 0.02), and increasing serum ferritin (P < 0.0001). After 6 weeks 
of refrigerated storage, transfusion was followed by increases in AUC for serum iron (P < 0.01), transferrin saturation (P < 0.001), 
and nontransferrin-bound iron (P < 0.001) as compared with transfusion after 1 to 5 weeks of storage.
CONCLUSIONS. After 6 weeks of refrigerated storage, transfusion of autologous red cells to healthy human volunteers 
increased extravascular hemolysis, saturated serum transferrin, and produced circulating nontransferrin-bound iron. These 
outcomes, associated with increased risks of harm, provide evidence that the maximal allowable red cell storage duration 
should be reduced to the minimum sustainable by the blood supply, with 35 days as an attainable goal.

and iron homeostasis. Our primary outcome was the 
appearance of circulating nontransferrin-bound iron, 
indicating that the physiologic capacity to process the 
iron released from the catabolism of cleared, refrigerat-
ed storage–damaged red cells was exceeded.
Results
Study participant demographics and recruitment. All out-
comes were collected between March 24, 2014, and 
January 20, 2016. Of the 60 subjects randomized, 52 
completed the study and had evaluable primary out-
comes (Figure 1); one of these subjects did not com-
plete the posttransfusion recovery study for scheduling 
reasons. The primary reasons for unsuccessful comple-
tion included personal reasons (n = 4), blood donation 
technical failures (n = 2), and positive infectious disease 
testing (n = 2). The groups had similar baseline charac-
teristics (Table 1).
Circulating nontransferrin-bound iron is produced 
in transfusion recipients after 6 weeks of red cell storage. 
Following transfusions of 1 autologous, packed red 
cell unit, the amount of iron entering the circulation 
exceeded the iron-uptake capacity of transferrin (the 
physiologic iron transport protein), producing circulat-
ing nontransferrin-bound iron in 10% (1/10) and 78% 
(7/9) of subjects transfused with red cells stored for 5 
and 6 weeks, respectively (P = 0.003) (Figure 2A). The 
AUC of the change in nontransferrin-bound iron after 
6 weeks of storage was increased, as compared with all 
other groups (P < 0.001) (Figure 2B).
Transfusion of red cells after longer storage duration 
induces increased extravascular hemolysis, but not intravascular 
hemolysis. Following transfusion, serum indirect bilirubin levels 
progressively increased with increasing storage time (P < 0.001 
for linear trend in AUC; Figure 3A). The AUC of the change in 
indirect bilirubin differed significantly when comparing subjects 
randomized to 6-week–stored red cells relative to 1- and 2-week–
stored red cells (P = 0.003 and P = 0.004, respectively). Concur-
rently, posttransfusion serum iron concentration progressively 
increased with increasing storage time (P < 0.0001 for linear trend 
in AUC; Figure 3B). The AUC of the change in serum iron after 6 
weeks of red cell storage was increased, as compared with all oth-
er groups (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Furthermore, all subjects 
transfused with 6-week–stored red cells had increased serum 
iron above the upper limit of our clinical laboratory’s healthy ref-
erence range (i.e., 158 μg/dl). Consistent with increasing serum 
iron, transferrin saturation increased with increasing storage time 
(P < 0.0001 for linear trend in AUC; Figure 3C). The AUC of the 
change in transferrin saturation was significantly different in sub-
jects randomized to 6-week–stored red cells as compared with all 
other groups (P < 0.001 for all comparisons) and with subjects 
randomized to 5-week–stored red cells relative to 1 and 2 weeks of 
storage (P = 0.007 and P = 0.04, respectively).
Lactate dehydrogenase (Figure 4A), haptoglobin (Figure 
4B), and plasma-free hemoglobin (Figure 4C) levels did not dif-
fer among the groups. Although decreases in haptoglobin were 
observed in all groups, the decreases were parallel to concurrent 
14 million units of whole blood and red cells are collected annu-
ally (9). The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Recipient 
Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III) found 
that 9.7%–20.7% of red cell units transfused at 7 hospitals were 
stored for longer than 35 days (10); thus, a considerable number of 
patients are potentially at risk.
Concerns about potential harm from transfusing the oldest 
blood have led the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, and 
large blood services in Germany to restrict the maximum red cell 
storage duration to 35 days (11); the US NIH Blood Bank has a simi-
lar policy (12). A retrospective review of 28,247 transfused patients 
provided new evidence that transfusing red cells near their 42-day 
storage limit may have harmful effects (13). This study compared 
clinical outcomes in patients transfused exclusively with red cells 
stored not more than 21 days with those in patients transfused exclu-
sively with red cells stored 35 days or more. In critically ill patients, 
red cells stored for 35–42 days were associated with increased 
morbidity (P = 0.002) and mortality (P = 0.009) (13). Although 
prospective data are needed to guide clinical practice, prospective 
clinical trials cannot determine the storage duration that increas-
es the risk of harmful events because, for ethical reasons, patients 
cannot be randomly assigned to receive the oldest blood (12). As 
an alternative, we randomized healthy adults to a single standard, 
autologous, leukoreduced, packed red cell transfusion after 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, or 6 weeks of storage, determined 51-chromium 20-hour red 
cell recoveries, and measured laboratory indicators of hemolysis

all subjects throughout the study, with no clinically significant dif-
ferences in temperature, heart rate, or blood pressure among the 
groups at any time (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material 
available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI90837DS1).
Discussion
After 6 weeks of refrigerated storage, with strict adherence to cur-
rent FDA standards, transfusions of healthy adult volunteers with 
single, autologous, leukoreduced units of packed red cells over-
decreases in total serum protein from immediately after transfu-
sion to 20 hours after transfusion (Figure 4D). The changes in total 
serum protein also did not differ between the groups.
Transfusion of red cells after longer duration of storage induces 
increasing hepcidin, but not IL-6, levels. Hepcidin, the master reg-
ulator of iron homeostasis, is regulated by iron and inflammation 
(14). Following transfusion, serum hepcidin levels progressive-
ly increased with increasing storage time (P = 0.005 for linear 
trend in AUC; Figure 5A). The AUC of the change in hepcidin 
differed significantly when comparing subjects randomized to 
6-week–stored red cells relative to 1- and 2-week–stored red cells 
(P = 0.004 and P = 0.049, respectively). There was not a tempo-
rally associated rise in IL-6 levels, and IL-6 levels did not differ 
between the groups (Figure 5B).
Measures of red cell clearance are increased after transfusion of red 
cells stored for longer duration. Only 1 of the 52 study subjects had 
a 20-hour posttransfusion red cell recovery below the mean FDA 
guideline of 75% (Figure 6A). Furthermore, the percentage of post-
transfusion red cell recovery (i.e., the percentage of transfused red 
cells surviving in circulation for at least 20 hours) decreased with 
increasing storage time (Pearson coefficient r = 0.42, P = 0.002). 
Similarly, the change in hematocrit, from pretransfusion to 20 
hours after transfusion, decreased with increasing storage dura-
tion (Pearson coefficient r = 0.32, P = 0.02) (Figure 6B). Finally, 
the change in ferritin, from pretransfusion to 20 hours after trans-
fusion, increased with increasing storage duration (Pearson coef-
ficient r= 0.52, P < 0.0001) (Figure 6C).
There were no adverse effects attributable to the transfusions in 
healthy volunteers. Only 1 adverse event was reported to the inves-
tigators and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) at 
Columbia University Medical Center. This subject, randomized to 
transfusion with 5-week–stored red cells, developed a tooth abscess 
2 days after transfusion, but had a prior history of poor dentition 
and abscesses; thus, the subject and DSMB deemed it unlikely to 
be associated with transfusion. Vital signs also remained stable in

recipient) of a subpopulation of storage-damaged, transfused red 
cells following storage for greater than 2 weeks. Indirect bilirubin 
and iron levels progressively increased with increasing storage 
time, without significant effects on lactate dehydrogenase, hap-
toglobin, or plasma-free hemoglobin concentrations. According 
to US FDA guidelines, up to 1% of ex vivo hemolysis is permissi-
ble in the storage bag prior to transfusion (2), which could lead 
to elevated plasma-free hemoglobin levels in some transfusion 
recipients. However, we found no differences in several markers 
of intravascular hemolysis (e.g., plasma-free hemoglobin, hap-
toglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase) in healthy subjects after 
transfusion of a single unit stored for 1 to 6 weeks. Thus, the cir-
culating iron and indirect bilirubin levels observed after trans-
fusion are almost certainly the catabolic breakdown products of 
the hemoglobin delivered to the monocyte/macrophage system 
by extravascular hemolysis.
In healthy adults, approximately 1 mg of iron is released per 
hour from catabolism of senescent red cells (15). In contrast, current 
FDA criteria include an average 51-chromium posttransfusion red 
cell recovery of 75% or more in healthy volunteers at outdate (16), 
allowing up to 25% of transfused red cells to be cleared from the 
circulation in the first 24 hours, which is equivalent to approximate-
ly 60 mg of iron (17). Because most storage-damaged red cells are 
cleared within the first hour after transfusion (18), the rate of macro-
phage iron export to plasma can exceed the rate of iron acquisition 
by circulating transferrin, resulting in the appearance of nontrans-
ferrin-bound iron. Thus, our results provide compelling evidence 
that transfusions of 6-week–stored units overwhelm the physiologic 
capacity of healthy volunteers to process the iron released from the 
catabolism of cleared, storage-damaged red cells.
Circulating nontransferrin-bound iron is the iron within the 
circulation that is neither bound to the physiologic iron-transport 
protein, transferrin, nor a constituent of heme or ferritin (19). In 
healthy individuals, little, if any, nontransferrin-bound iron is ever 
present within the circulation. In health, iron enters the plasma 
principally from the recycling of iron derived from senescent eryth-
rocytes by a dedicated population of macrophages in the spleen, 
liver, and bone marrow (20). Much smaller amounts enter plasma 
from iron absorption by duodenal enterocytes or from mobiliza-
tion of stores within hepatocytes. For all these sources, ferropor-
tin, the cellular iron export protein, is the sole known conduit for 
iron to enter plasma. Ferroxidase activity is required for iron export 
through ferroportin, provided by ceruloplasmin in macrophages 
and by hephaestin in duodenal enterocytes. The release of iron 
into plasma does not require unsaturated transferrin; unsaturated 
transferrin does not enter cells, but accepts iron only after the exit 
of ferrous iron through ferroportin and its subsequent oxidation. 
Thus, iron is exported from cells via ferroportin whether or not cir-
culating unsaturated transferrin is available. If the rate of iron influx 
into plasma exceeds the rate of iron acquisition by plasma transfer-
rin, circulating nontransferrin-bound iron develops as a heteroge-
neous assortment of iron complexes (e.g., complexes of albumin, 
citrate, and potentially acetate, malate, or phosphate) (21). Thus, 
if the rate of iron efflux is sufficiently rapid, nontransferrin-bound 
iron is measurable at a transferrin saturation of approximately 70% 
and above (22). To control the efflux of iron into the circulation, fer-
roportin is regulated by hepcidin, which is itself regulated by iron, 
whelmed their physiologic capacity to process the cleared stor-
age-damaged red cells, releasing large amounts of iron into the 
circulation. Transfusion effectiveness, in terms of increasing the 
hematocrit and the number of circulating red cells (i.e., posttrans-
fusion red cell recovery), decreased with increasing storage time. 
Although indirect bilirubin, iron, ferritin, hepcidin, and transfer-
rin saturation levels progressively increased in recipients in pro-
portion to increasing storage duration, volunteers transfused with 
autologous red cells stored for 1 to 5 weeks did not produce sig-
nificant amounts of circulating nontransferrin-bound iron, with 
the exception of 1 volunteer who received a 5-week–stored unit. 
In contrast, 78% (i.e., 7/9) of volunteers transfused with 6-week–
stored red cells developed substantial amounts of circulating non-
transferrin-bound iron that persisted for 10 hours or more. These 
results provide evidence of physiologic differences in the conse-
quences of transfusing red cells stored for 6 weeks, as compared 
with those stored for 1 to 5 weeks.

defenses, no adverse events were observed during the approximate-
ly 10 hours of persistent circulation of nontransferrin-bound iron. 
Nonetheless, in animal studies, even short duration of circulating 
nontransferrin-bound iron enhanced the virulence of bloodstream 
pathogens (24–27). In addition, in a prior healthy human volunteer 
study, increased nontransferrin-bound iron in the sera obtained 
after transfusing 6-week–stored red cells enhanced proliferation in 
vitro of a pathogenic strain of E. coli (28). Similarly, increased serum 
iron present following oral iron supplementation enhanced prolifer-
ation in vitro of isolates of E. coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella 
enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus epidermidis (29). 
Furthermore, in a retrospective analysis of patients receiving red 
cells stored for either 21 days or less or 35 days or more, there was 
a higher prevalence of infection in those receiving the older units 
(P = 0.007) (13). In other clinical settings, circulating nontransfer-
rin-bound iron is also associated with increased risks of infectious 
complications; for example, following myelosuppression for acute 
leukemia, patients with plasma nontransferrin-bound iron lev-
els greater than 2 μM had a higher risk of Gram-negative sepsis 
 
(P = 0.0004) (30). Finally, by participating in Fenton chemistry, 
nontransferrin-bound iron causes oxidative damage and cytotox-
icity and enhances endothelial expression of adhesion molecules, 
thereby increasing thrombotic risk (19, 21, 31, 32).
One limitation of the current study is that only 1 unit of packed 
red cells was transfused. Although hospitalized patients frequently 
receive multiple units of blood, the cumulative effect of transfus-
ing multiple units was not examined. In addition, this study was 
performed in healthy, adult volunteers rather than in ill patients. 
However, according to current ethical standards, studies cannot 
randomize patients to transfusions restricted to the final week of 
storage (4, 12). Nonetheless, red cell recovery and hemolysis may 
be even worse in ill patients, as compared with the healthy volun-
teers (18). Indeed, in critically ill children and neonates, elevated 
circulating nontransferrin-bound iron levels were observed after 
transfusion, even before the final week of red cell storage (33, 34). 
Finally, for logistical reasons, 20-hour, as opposed to 24-hour, red 
cell recovery studies were performed. The 24-hour red cell recov-
ery would be expected to be lower than the 20-hour recovery given 
the extra 4 hours of clearance. Nonetheless, the 20-hour red cell 
recovery is a close approximation to that after 24 hours because 
most clearance of storage-damaged red cells occurs during the 
first hour after transfusion (18).
In conclusion, the current results provide unequivocal 
evidence that the transfusion of red cells stored for 6 weeks 
exceeds the physiologic capacity of healthy volunteers to pro-
cess the iron released from the catabolism of cleared red cells. 
Current FDA criteria allowing blood storage for 6 weeks are 
not founded on outcomes of clinical trials, but based on stan-
dards historically derived from expert opinion. In our study, 
the nontransferrin-bound iron levels measured in healthy vol-
unteers after routine infusions of single units of autologous red 
cells are almost certainly lower than those that develop in ill 
patients, particularly after transfusion of multiple units of allo-
geneic red cells. Indeed, in observational studies of critically ill 
children and neonates, circulating nontransferrin-bound iron 
levels were elevated after transfusion (33, 34). Nonetheless, it 
is virtually impossible to conduct prospective clinical trials to 
inflammation (e.g., IL-6), and erythropoietic drive (14, 23). We did 
not observe any temporally associated changes in circulating IL-6 
levels, suggesting that the increased hepcidin levels observed after 
transfusion of 6-week–stored red cells was driven predominantly 
by increases in transferrin saturation. Still, the rate and magnitude 
of hepcidin production were not sufficient to prevent the appear-
ance of circulating nontransferrin-bound iron from approximately 
2 to 14 hours after transfusion of 6-week–stored red cells.
Accumulating evidence indicates that the diverse mixture of 
iron complexes composed of nontransferrin-bound iron can direct-
ly produce harm (17). In the healthy volunteers in our study, with 
normal hepatic, splenic, and renal function and intact antioxidant 
Figure 4. Markers of intravascular hemolysis are not increased following 
transfusion of a single, autologous red cell unit into healthy volunteers.

provide evidence-based guidance regarding the hazards posed 
by transfusing red blood cells stored for 35 to 42 days. Both 
the ethics of randomizing patients to transfusions restricted 
to the final week of storage and the logistics of enrolling the 
large numbers of patients needed to detect risks in specific 
subgroups are prohibitive. In addition, studies suggest that the 
blood supply would not be significantly affected by limiting 
the maximum allowable storage duration to 35 days (35–38); 
indeed, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the 
NIH already have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. 
Given the inability to perform definitive prospective random-
ized clinical trials examining red cell transfusions during the 
final week of storage, our evidence of the potential harm from 
extravascular hemolysis and circulating nontransferrin-bound 
iron, together with prudence and the precautionary principle, 
suggest that the maximal allowable storage period should be 
reduced to the minimum sustainable by the blood supply, with 
35 days as an attainable goal.
Methods
Study design. A single center, parallel-group, randomized trial com-
pared the effects of transfusing 1 autologous packed red cell unit after 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks of storage. The primary outcome was the AUC 
for the change in circulating nontransferrin-bound iron from pretrans-
fusion to multiple time points after transfusion. Other iron-related 
parameters and hemolysis markers were secondary outcomes. Sub-
jects and study coordinators were not blinded because subjects were 
scheduled for donation and transfusion based on the randomization 
scheme. Nonetheless, nonresearch staff nurses, without knowledge of 
study hypotheses, obtained all blood draws and blinded technologists 
performed all laboratory testing. A simple randomization scheme with 
1 block was developed by the study statistician and recorded in consec-
utively numbered sealed paper slips by a nonstudy staff member. Fol-
lowing informed consent and screening for eligibility criteria, the next 
sequential paper slip was opened by the study coordinator to determine 
treatment allocation. Blood donations were at The New York Blood 
Center and transfusions at Columbia University Medical Center— New 
York Presbyterian Hospital. The first and last authors vouch for the 
completeness and accuracy of the data and analyses presented.
Participants and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants were 
principally recruited by flyers posted throughout the Columbia 
University Medical Center. Respondents were screened in person, 
and screening blood samples were collected to determine eligibil-
ity; criteria included age of 18 to 65 and meeting the standards for 
allogeneic blood donation (hemoglobin >12.5 g/dl and body weight 
>110 lbs [50 kg]).
Exclusion criteria were ineligibility for donation based on The 
New York Blood Center autologous blood donor questionnaire, sys-
Figure 5. Serum hepcidin is increased following transfusion of red cells 
stored for longer duration, but this does not appear to be mediated by 
circulating IL-6 levels. (A and B) Medians (I bars represent interquar-
tile ranges) for the changes in serum hepcidin and IL-6, as labeled, are 
shown from pretransfusion to all posttransfusion time points. Statistical 
significance for ANOVA using post-hoc Tukey’s test of the AUC among the 
groups is shown. *P < 0.05. n = 52 total.
Figure 6. Transfusion of red cells after longer duration of storage is asso-
ciated with decreased red cell recovery, decreased change in hematocrit, 
and increased iron stores. (A) The 51-chromium 20-hour posttransfusion red 
blood cell recovery is shown. The dotted red line denotes the FDA criterion 
for acceptability (i.e., at outdate, on average >75% of transfused red blood 
cells should still be circulating after 24 hours). n = 51 total. (B and C) The 
changes in hematocrit and serum ferritin, respectively, for each subject from 
pretransfusion to 20 hours after transfusion are shown. n = 52 total. Results 
of linear regression are shown with the 95% CI in dashed black lines.

tolic blood pressure greater than 180 or less than 90 mmHg, dia-
stolic blood pressure greater than 100 or less than 50 mm Hg, heart 
rate less than 50 or greater than 100 beats per minute, temperature 
greater than 99.5°F (>37.5°C) before donation, temperature greater 
than 100.4°F (>38°C) or subjective feeling of illness before transfusion 
(to avoid having a concurrent illness affect posttransfusion measure-
ments), positive results on standard blood donor infectious disease 
testing, and positive urine pregnancy test for females.
Procedures. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 
ratio, for a single autologous red cell transfusion after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
or 6 weeks (±2 days) of storage. Each donated whole blood unit was 
leukoreduced and processed into a standard, packed, red cell unit in 
Additive Solution Formula 3 (AS-3; Haemonetics Corp.) by The New 
York Blood Center, shipped to the Columbia University Medical Cen-
ter — New York Presbyterian Hospital Blood Bank, and refrigerator 
stored until issue. Immediately before issue, a 25 ml aliquot, obtained 
from the unit using a sterile docking device, was radiolabeled with 
51-chromium, as described (39).
Study subjects were admitted to the Columbia University Med-
ical Center for 24 hours. After pretransfusion blood samples were 
collected, subjects were transfused at 200 ml per hour. Vital signs 
were recorded before transfusion, 15 minutes after starting transfu-
sion, and immediately and 1 hour after transfusion. Blood samples, 
obtained from a peripherally placed intravenous line, were collected 
immediately and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 20 hours after trans-
fusion. Between 1 and 4 hours after transfusion, the 51-chromium–
labeled red cell aliquot was infused over 1 minute. Blood samples 
were then obtained every 2.5 minutes between 5 and 15 minutes after 
infusion and used to extrapolate the time zero and the final time point 
for chromium recovery (39).
Laboratory measures. Routine laboratory parameters were 
measured at the Columbia University Medical Center — New York 
Presbyterian Hospital Clinical Laboratories. Transferrin saturation 
and total iron binding capacity were calculated from the measured 
serum iron and unbound iron-binding capacity. When the unbound 
iron-binding capacity was below the clinical laboratory’s reportable 
range, transferrin saturation was imputed by averaging the clos-
est time points with calculable total iron-binding capacities. Non-
transferrin-bound iron was measured using an ultrafiltration assay 
(26, 28); this method correlates well with other techniques (22). 
Plasma-free hemoglobin was measured by a modified cyanomet-
hemoglobin method (40). Hepcidin and IL-6 were measured using 
commercial ELISA kits (Bachem and R&D Systems, respectively), 
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistics. Between-group differences in binary and categorical 
variables were compared using Fisher’s exact tests. Continuous 
variables were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Data on the 
primary outcome of nontransferrin-bound iron and other second-
ary markers of hemolysis (e.g., indirect bilirubin, serum iron, trans-
ferrin saturation, hepcidin, lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, 
free hemoglobin) were compared using an ANOVA with post-hoc 
Tukey’s test of the AUC from the pretransfusion value through all 
time points up to 20 hours after transfusion. When calculating the 
AUC, peaks that were less than 10% of the distance from minimum 
to maximum were ignored. Pearson’s linear regression was also 
performed to examine linear trends in AUC values and relation-
ships between storage duration and change in hematocrit, post-
transfusion red cell recovery, and ferritin level at 20 hours after 
transfusion, as compared with the pretransfusion levels. Analyses 
were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), 
and Prism, version 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.). A P value of less 
than 0.05 was considered significant. Figures with error bars show 
medians with the interquartile range.
The target sample size of 60 participants was intended to achieve 
90% power at 1% α and a 1-way analysis of covariance to test the 
between-group differences of 6 red cell storage duration groups of the 
AUC values for nontransferrin-bound iron at one-quarter of the range 
observed in a preliminary study (28). This allowed for up to a 20% 
dropout rate (i.e., only 8 subjects required per group).
Study approval. The study was conducted according to the Dec-
laration of Helsinki and in accordance with good clinical practice 
guidelines. The study was approved by the Columbia University 
Medical Center and New York Blood Center Institutional Review 
Boards. All research participants provided written, informed con-
sent prior to study participation. An independent DSMB at Colum-
bia University Medical Center conducted regular safety reviews.
