Summary
Background Studies evaluating titration of antihypertensive medication using self-monitoring give contradictory 
findings and the precise place of telemonitoring over self-monitoring alone is unclear. The TASMINH4 trial aimed to 
assess the efficacy of self-monitored blood pressure, with or without telemonitoring, for antihypertensive titration in 
primary care, compared with usual care.
Methods This study was a parallel randomised controlled trial done in 142 general practices in the UK, and included 
hypertensive patients older than 35 years, with blood pressure higher than 140/90 mm Hg, who were willing to self-
monitor their blood pressure. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to self-monitoring blood pressure (self-
montoring group), to self-monitoring blood pressure with telemonitoring (telemonitoring group), or to usual care 
(clinic blood pressure; usual care group). Randomisation was by a secure web-based system. Neither participants nor 
investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was clinic measured systolic blood pressure at 
12 months from randomisation. Primary analysis was of available cases. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 
ISRCTN 83571366.
Findings 1182 participants were randomly assigned to the self-monitoring group (n=395), the telemonitoring group 
(n=393), or the usual care group (n=394), of whom 1003 (85%) were included in the primary analysis. After 12 months, 
systolic blood pressure was lower in both intervention groups compared with usual care (self-monitoring, 137·0 
[SD 16·7] mm Hg and telemonitoring, 136·0 [16·1] mm Hg vs usual care, 140·4 [16·5]; adjusted mean differences vs 
usual care: self-monitoring alone, –3·5 mm Hg [95% CI –5·8 to –1·2]; telemonitoring, –4·7 mm Hg [–7·0 to –2·4]). 
No difference between the self-monitoring and telemonitoring groups was recorded (adjusted mean difference 
–1·2 mm Hg [95% CI –3·5 to 1·2]). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses including multiple imputation.
Adverse events were similar between all three groups.
Interpretation Self-monitoring, with or without telemonitoring, when used by general practitioners to titrate 
antihypertensive medication in individuals with poorly controlled blood pressure, leads to significantly lower blood 
pressure than titration guided by clinic readings. With most general practitioners and many patients using self-
monitoring, it could become the cornerstone of hypertension management in primary care.

Introduction
Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease, the greatest cause of morbidity and mortality 
internationally.1,2 Despite the widespread availability 
of effective treatment, control of hypertension in the 
community remains sub-optimal.3,4 Key reasons for 
this include clinical inertia, poor adherence, and 
organisational failure.5–7
Self-monitoring as part of a self-management strategy 
is an effective way to improve blood pressure control, 
but is only applicable to those willing to self-titrate.8,9 
Self-monitoring in isolation is not associated with better 
blood pressure control, but is effective in combination 
with other co-interventions.10 Many primary-care phys-
icians incorporate self-monitored readings in their 
treatment decisions, but there is considerable variation 
in practice,11 and mixed evidence to support such an 
approach: two previous European studies with 12 months 
follow-up where physicians used self-monitored blood 
pressure to explicitly titrate antihypertensive medication

have resulted in worse blood pressure control.12,13 In both 
studies, the prescribing physicians were masked to the 
method of blood pressure measurement and used a 
common target blood pressure for both home and clinic 
readings (140/90 mm Hg) as opposed to lower home 
targets (typically 135/85 mm Hg) as recommended by 
contemporary guidelines.14 An intervention including 
telemonitoring 
and 
self-monitoring 
with 
general 
practitioner (GP) titration of antihypertensives in 
Scotland showed significant reductions in blood pressure 
using lower home targets (home 135/85 mm Hg vs clinic 
140/90 mm Hg) but only followed up patients for 
6 months.15
Current UK hypertension guidelines reflect the 
uncertainty in the literature by recommending self-
monitoring of blood pressure as one option for the 
diagnosis of hypertension, but only for longer term 
management in the context of white coat hypertension.14 
They gave an explicit research recommendation that 
a new trial was needed to understand the place of 
self-monitoring and telemonitoring of blood pressure 
in the management of hypertension in primary care. 
The TASMINH4 trial aimed to evaluate whether 
GPs using self-monitored blood pressure to titrate anti-
hypertensive medication in people with treated but 
inadequately controlled hypertension, resulted in lower 
systolic blood pressure than usual care and whether 
telemonitoring resulted in lower blood pressure than 
self-monitoring alone.
Methods
Study design and participants
This was an unmasked randomised controlled trial 
with automated ascertainment of the end point. 
Detailed methods have been published previously.16
Potentially eligible participants were identified using 
automated searches of electronic primary care patient 
records in practices in England, UK. The searches 
identified individuals potentially eligible in terms of 
age, hypertension diagnosis, current medication, and 
last recorded systolic blood pressure above 145 mm Hg. 
Inclusion criteria were age older than 35 years, with 
a diagnosis of hypertension, taking no more than 
three antihypertensive agents, but with clinic blood 
pressure not controlled below 140/90 mm Hg. They had 
to be on stable antihypertensive medication for at least 
4 weeks before randomisation and free from orthostatic 
hypotension, atrial fibrillation, dementia, or chronic 
kidney disease of grade 4 or worse, or chronic kidney 
disease with proteinuria.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We updated our systematic reviews from inception to 
Jan 2, 2018, in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library with 
search terms designed to capture all trials using self-monitoring 
of blood pressure, with or without telemonitoring, to guide the 
titration of antihypertensive treatment without other 
co-interventions. Search terms included ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring, home or self monitoring, telemedicine, 
and randomised controlled trials, and we had no language 
restrictions. We found three trials that fulfilled these criteria, one 
of which used telemonitoring. Two trials (the Treatment of 
Hypertension Based on Home or Office Blood Pressure trial and 
the Home Versus Office Measurement, Reduction of 
Unnecessary Treatment Study) found that when clinicians used 
home readings to titrate treatment, this led to worse blood 
pressure control and less treatment after 1 year as compared 
with using clinic readings. Identical treatment targets were used 
for both home and clinic blood pressures. A third trial (Health 
Impact of nurse-led Telemetry Services) used a 
telemonitoring-based service to capture home readings and 
guide treatment compared with usual care, both using guideline 
recommended targets which were lower for home readings. 
The telemonitoring, home titration group had lower blood 
pressure than clinic-based care after 6 months.
Added value of this study
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial in primary 
care of antihypertensive titration using self-monitored blood 
pressure, with or without telemonitoring, to show a benefit 
in terms of blood pressure after 12 months. Differences in 
blood pressure recorded at 6 months were amplified by 1 year 
suggesting that the intervention increased in efficacy in the 
second 6 months. This was achieved without increased 
workload and using internationally recommended targets 
for home and clinic blood pressure, the former lower by 
5/5 mm Hg. Additional benefit from telemonitoring was seen 
in terms of lower blood pressure after 6 months suggesting 
more efficient titration.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study provides good evidence that self-monitoring can 
be used, with or without telemonitoring, to guide 
antihypertensive titration in a primary-care setting for people 
with poorly controlled blood pressure, provided that lower 
targets are used for home measurements. The decision to use 
telemonitoring will depend on whether the additional 
benefits in terms of speed of titration and ease of use are 
considered worthwhile. The reductions in blood pressure 
observed would be expected to reduce stroke risk by 
around 20% and coronary heart disease risk by about 10%. 
Self-monitoring can be recommended for the ongoing 
management of hypertension in primary care in all patients 
who wish to use it, and general practitioners should 
incorporate self-monitored readings into their titration of 
blood pressure medications.

A trial steering group and data monitoring com-
mittee supervised the trial. Ethical approval was gained from 
Oxford NHS Research Ethics Committee B (14/SC/0218). 
All patients gave written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Potentially eligible patients were invited to research clinics 
held in their own general practices between Nov 13, 2014, 
and Feb 3, 2016 where they were screened for eligibility, 
informed consent taken, baseline measure 
ments taken, 
and questionnaires administered. Eligible and willing 
participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using a secure 
web-based system, to GP antihyper 
tensive titration using 
clinic readings (usual care group), using self-monitoring 
alone (self-monitoring group), or using self-monitoring 
with telemonitoring (telemonitoring group), with stratifi-
cation by practice and mini 
misation on baseline blood 
pressure, sex, and blood pressure target.
Neither participants nor investigators were masked 
to group assignment in this open trial. Outcome 
measurement was not masked but used the automatic 
mode of the sphygmomanometer to measure blood 
pressure without the need for intervention by the 
investigator other than to place the cuff and switch the 
device on. 
Procedures
Following randomisation, all participants were asked to 
attend their own GP for a medication review. Participants 
randomly assigned to usual care were thereafter managed 
with titration of antihypertensive treatment based on 
clinic blood pressure measurements at the discretion of 
their attending health-care professional.
Participants randomly assigned to self-monitoring 
were taught to use a validated automated electronic 
sphygmomanometer (Omron M10-IT; Omron Healthcare 
Europe, Hoofddorp, Netherlands).17 They were asked 
to monitor their own blood pressure in their non-
dominant arm, twice each morning and evening, for the 
first week of every month using standard recommend-
ations and their GPs were asked to use the self-
monitored measurements for titration of antihypertensive 
medication.14,18
For those self-monitoring alone, a simple colour chart 
was used to train participants to attend their practice for 
blood pressure checks in the light of very high or very low 
readings. At the end of each monitoring week they were 
asked to record their readings on paper and send them 
for review to their practice in a reply-paid envelope. 
Participants in the telemonitoring group were trained 
to send readings via a simple free SMS text-based 
telemonitoring service with web-based data entry back-up. 
The telemonitoring system incorporated an algorithm 
that alerted participants to contact their surgery in the 
light of very high or very low readings, reminded them if 
insufficient readings were transmitted, prompted them to 
make contact with their practice if their average blood 
pressure was above target, and presented readings to 
attending clinicians via a web interface (appendix p 9). 
This secure web page automatically calcu 
lated mean blood 
pressure for each monitoring week, highlighted very high 
or very low readings, and presented a graphical display of 
blood pressure measurements.
Attending clinicians were asked to review both self-
monitoring and telemonitoring groups’ readings on a 
monthly basis and usual care patients as often as they 
wished. Blood pressure targets were based on current 
National Guidelines adjusted for self-monitoring: lower 
than 140/90 mm Hg (<135/85 mm Hg at home) for 
those younger than 80 years, lower than 150/90 mm Hg 
(<145/85 mm Hg at home) for those 80 years or older, and 
lower than 140/80 mm Hg (<135/75 mm Hg at home) for 
those with diabetes.14 Clinicians in the trial had complete 
freedom to adjust antihypertensive and other medication 
as they sought fit, regardless of which group an individual 
was randomly assigned to and with no restriction on type 
of drug used. All participants were followed up at 6 and 
12 months by research nurses.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was clinic measured systolic blood 
pressure, adjusted for baseline covariates at 12 months. 
Blood pressure was measured by a research nurse using a 
validated monitor, six times at baseline and each follow-up 
appointment in a standardised fashion, using the same 
arm and cuff size each time, in a seated position after at 
least 5 min rest.19 The mean of the second and third 
readings was used in the primary outcome.
Other outcomes included other measures of blood 
pressure at 6 and 12 months (systolic and diastolic, in each 
case mean of the second and third readings and the mean 
of the second to the sixth readings), adverse events 
(side-effects, cardiovascular events, anxiety),20,21 medication 
prescription (number and defined daily dose),22 self-
reported adherence (Medication Adherence Rating Scale 
[MARS]),23 weight and waist circumference, lifestyle 
factors (alcohol, diet, exercise, and smoking),24 and quality 
of life (EQ-5D-5L).25 Cost-effectiveness and qualitative sub-
studies will be reported separately.
Statistical analysis
It was estimated that 1110 patients (370 per group, allowing 
for 15% attrition) would be required to detect a 5 mm Hg 
systolic blood pressure difference between the groups 
with 90% power and an adjusted alpha of 0·017 (two-sided) 
to account for all three pair 
wise comparisons. This 
calculation was based on an assumption of a common 
SD of 17 mm Hg and a three-way pairwise comparison.
Analysis was done following database lock on an 
intention-to-treat basis fitting a linear mixed-effects 
model, which modelled outcome data collected at 6 and 
12 months from randomisation, adjusting for baseline 
blood pressure measure. Practices and measurements 
from the same participant were accounted for by means

of random intercepts. Time (categorical measure) and 
randomised group were fitted as fixed effects, with 
minimisation variables (sex and blood pressure target), 
and history of cardiovascular disease fitted as covariates. 
An interaction term between time and randomisation 
group was included so that the treatment effect could be 
assessed at each timepoint. The self-monitoring and 
telemonitoring groups were first compared with usual 
care and then with each other since both were found more 
effective than usual care.16
The continuous secondary outcomes were analysed by 
means of a linear mixed-effects model using the same 
strategy as for the primary outcome. Binary outcomes for 
symptoms were analysed by means of a logistic mixed-
effects model and group differences presented as 
adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Random effects

were used to account for repeated measurements and 
practice. Smoking was analysed using a log-binomial 
model and group differences presented as adjusted 
relative risks (RRs), accounting for baseline smoking, 
with 95% CIs.
Sensitivity analyses examined the robustness of 
the results using different approaches to obtaining 
mean blood pressure, replacing missing values with 
other available blood pressure measures, or through 
multiple imputation.16 A statistical test of interaction 
was done to assess whether the effect of the intervent-
ions was consistent across the prespecified subgroups: 
age, sex, blood pressure target, base 
line blood pressure, 
Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), and history of 
cardiovascular disease. A detailed stat 
istical analysis plan 
was prepared before the final analysis and unmasking of 
treatment allocation (appendix pp 11–26).
Two amendments to the protocol were approved during 
the trial: first to clarify the safety reporting requirements 
and second to clarify that National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for self-monitoring 
of blood pressure, which had been operationalised 
from the start of the trial, was being followed in both 
intervention groups. Analysis was done using STATA 
version 14.2. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 
ISRCTN 83571366.
Role of the funding source
The funders and sponsors of the study had no role in 
study design, data collection, data analysis, data inter-

Results
Of 2383 individuals assessed for eligibility in 142 practices, 
1201 (50%) were excluded: 1196 (50%) did not meet the 
inclusion criteria and five (<1%) withheld their consent 
(figure 1). The main reasons for exclusion were blood 
pressure controlled (blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg, 
1048 patients), orthostatic hypertension (86 patients), or 
did not have a stable dose of antihypertensive medi-
cation (22 patients; appendix p 5). The remaining 
1182 (50%) patients from 138 practices were enrolled 
and randomly assigned: 394 (33%) to usual care, 
395 (33%) to self-monitoring alone, and 393 (33%) to self-
monitoring with tele 
monitoring. Early on in the trial, 
ten (<1%) patients randomly assigned to either self-
monitoring alone or usual care briefly received the 
telemonitoring inter 
vention due to a misunderstanding. 
Nine (<1%) participants who were randomised withdrew 
and removed consent for their data to be used; they were 
not included in any analysis.
The groups were well matched (table 1): mean age was 
66·9 years (SD 9·4), just over half were male, mean 
systolic blood pressure was 153·1/85·5 (SD 14·0/10·3) 
mm Hg, and mean time since hypertension diagnosis 
was 10·2 (SD 8·4) years.
Primary outcome data were available from 1003 (85%) 
participants and retention was not significantly lower in 
the intervention groups (328 [83%] in the self-monitoring 
group and 327 [83%] in the telemonitoring group vs 
348 [88%] in the usual care group, p=0·1119 for 
comparison; figure 1). After 12 months, mean systolic 
blood pressure (measured independently in a clinic 
setting) was lower in both intervention groups: self-
monitoring (137·0 [SD 16·7] mm Hg) and telemonitor-
ing (136·0 [16·1] mm Hg) compared with clinic 
mon 
itoring (140·4 [16·5] mm Hg): self-monitoring, 
adjusted mean difference (AMD) –3·5 mm Hg (95% CI 
–5·8 to –1·2), p=0·0029; and telemonitoring, –4·7 mm Hg

cant 
differ 
ence between the self-monitoring and tele 
monitoring 
groups (AMD –1·2 mm Hg [95% CI –3·5 to 1·2], 
p=0·3219).
Considering the sensitivity analyses, similar results were 
recorded when the mean of the second to the sixth readings 
was used, when those with one or other of the second or 
third measurements missing were included, where blood 
pressure measurements identified as outliers (ie, probably 
erroneous) were excluded, and where multiple imputation 
was used to replace missing values (appendix p 6).
After 6 months, mean systolic blood pressure in the 
group titrated using telemonitoring (139·0 [SD 16·8] 
mm Hg) but not the self-monitoring group (140·4 [15·7] 
mm Hg) was significantly lower than usual care

(table 2). There was no significant difference between 
the two intervention groups (AMD –1·5 [95% CI 
–3·8 to 0·7], p=0·1771). No evidence of differences in 
diastolic blood pressure between groups was found at 
6 or 12 months (table 2).
There was no evidence of an effect of prespecified 
subgroups on the difference between treatment groups. 
Some of the comparisons had wide CIs reflecting relatively 
few individuals in some of the groups (figure 2A, B).
After 12 months, individuals for whom self-monitoring 
and telemonitoring was used to titrate their anti-
hypertensives were prescribed additional medica-
tions compared with usual care (self-monitoring 1·63 
[SD 0·89], telemonitoring 1·70 [0·88], usual care 
1·55 [0·85] antihypertensives): an AMD of 0·11 (95% CI 
0·02 to 0·19) more medi 
cations in the self-monitoring 
group (p=0·0129) and 0·13 (0·04 to 0·21) more 
medications in the telemonitoring group (p=0·0038), 
both compared with usual care (table 3). Defined daily 
doses (DDDs)22 were significantly increased at 12 months 
in those where telemonitoring was used (DDD 2·69 
[SD 1·82], AMD 0·31 [95% CI 0·15 to 0·47], p<0·0001) 
but not in those self-monitoring (DDD 2·42 [1·75], AMD 
0·19 [0·03 to 0·36], p=0·0175), both compared with usual 
care (DDD 2·27 [1·65]), and this was largely driven by an 
increase in angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors 
and angiotensin receptor blockers (table 3).
No difference in self-reported adherence was recorded 
at 12 months between the three groups. MARS 
questionnaire scores were 23·8 (SD 1·9) in the self-
monitoring group, 24·0 (1·5) in the telemonitoring 
group, and 23·9 (1·9) in the usual care group (self-
monitoring vs usual care, AMD –0·05 [95% CI 
–0·27 to 0·17], p=0·6619; telemonitoring vs usual care, 
AMD 0·02 [–0·20 to 0·25], p=0·8334).23
Reported potential side-effects were similar between 
the three groups (table 4). There was no difference in 
anxiety between any of the groups (appendix p 7). 
Cardiovascular events (new atrial fibrillation, angina, 
myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft or 
angioplasty, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or heart 
failure) were recorded in nine patients in the usual care 
group, 12 in the self-monitoring group, and 11 in the 
telemonitoring group.
There was no evidence of a non-pharmacological effect 
of self-monitoring or telemonitoring in terms of diet, 
exercise, smoking, or alcohol consumption (appendix p 7). 
Similarly, weight was not significantly different between 
baseline and follow-up in either intervention group 
compared with the usual care group. Quality of life, as 
measured by the EQ-5D-5L,26 was not significantly different 
between each group at 12 months follow-up (appendix p 7).
The number of primary care consultations during the 
year of the study were similar between all three groups 
with slightly higher consultation rates in the first 6 months 
of the trial (appendix p 8). More clinic blood pressure 
readings were taken in the usual care group compared 
with the self-monitoring or telemonitoring groups.
Discussion
This trial has shown that the use of self-monitoring of 
blood pressure in primary care to titrate antihypertensive 
therapy for the management of individuals with poorly 
controlled hypertension in primary care results in lower

systolic blood pressure without increasing GP workload. 
After 1 year, patients whose medication was adjusted 
using self-monitoring, with or without telemonitoring, 
had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those 
receiving treatment adjusted using clinic blood pressure. 
There was no evidence of a differential effect in the 
subgroups examined, including importantly no difference 
by age.
This trial was not powered to detect cardiovascular 
outcomes, but the differences between the interventions 
and control in systolic blood pressure would be expected 
to result in around a 20% reduction in stroke risk and 
10% reduction in coronary heart disease risk.10,27 Although 
not significantly different from each other at 12 months, 
blood pressure in the group using telemonitoring for 
medication titration became lower more quickly (at 
6 months) than those self-monitoring alone, an effect 
which is likely to further reduce cardiovascular events 
and might improve longer term control.28,29
No evidence was found regarding increased adherence 
as measured by the MARS scale, but this might have 
been due to a ceiling effect as scores were above 95% of 
the maximum in each group.23 A recent systematic 
review found that self-monitoring increased adherence 
to antihypertensives, at least when measured by more 
objective means that were beyond the resources

available in this study.30,31 The results from prescribing 
records (table 3) suggest that the mechanism of action 
was differential intensification of antihypertensive 
medication in response to self-monitored blood 
pressure, although this was modest. No evidence of 
other non-pharmacological effects from self-monitoring 
were found, at least in terms of self-reported diet, 
exercise, or alcohol intake. Importantly, there were no 
differences in side-effects or quality of life despite 
greater medication use in the intervention groups.
This study was undertaken in a large population drawn 
from primary care across the UK. Patients were recruited 
from a wide variety of practices, had a mean blood pressure 
of 153/86 mm Hg, and 60% had another ongoing medical

condition. However, just over half of those assessed for the 
trial were not eligible, largely because of having controlled 
blood pressure. The average age of participants was 
67 years and approximately equal numbers of men and 
women took part, but most were white British ethnicity, 
which might limit generalisability. The commonest reason 
for exclusion from the trial was controlled blood pressure 
and the vast majority—around 90%—of those with 
uncontrolled blood pressure were randomised suggesting 
generalisability in this group.
Overall, the trial followed-up 85% of those randomised 
but there were, albeit non-significantly, fewer seen at 
final follow-up in both intervention groups compared 
with control (83% vs 88%), perhaps reflecting increased 
withdrawal due to the self-monitoring intervention. 
Despite this, recruitment was slightly higher than planned 
and the numbers in all three study groups comfortably 
exceeded the 315 participants per group required in the 
prespecified power calculation.16 Furthermore, sensitivity 
analyses using imputation gave similar results to those 
in the primary complete case analysis, suggesting that 
differential follow-up was unlikely to have biased the 
headline results.
Ambulatory monitoring might have been a superior 
outcome measurement in terms of better correlation with 
cardiovascular outcome and reduced white coat effect, but 
would have raised substantial barriers in terms of logistical 
and financial challenges.32 The use of multiple blood 
pressure measurements in the sensitivity analysis formed 
a proxy for ambulatory monitoring and, as with other 
work from this group, no evidence was found of 
habituation to repeated blood pressure measurement.8,9 
Use of clinic measurements at baseline will have 
potentially excluded those with masked uncontrolled 
hypertension.33 There was no evidence of increased 
anxiety from self-monitoring,21 something which is often 
mentioned by health-care professionals but which has not 
been detected in trials by this group to date.34
Clinician consulting rates for hypertension over the year 
were similar in all three groups (mean consultations 
[95% CI]: usual care, 2·1 [1·9 to 2·3]; self-monitoring, 
1·8 [1·6 to 2·1]; and telemonitoring, 2·2 [2·0 to 2·5]), but 
given that clinicians were asked to review intervention 
groups’ blood pressure on a monthly basis, might have 
failed to capture additional workload associated with 
self-monitoring.
We have recently published an individual patient data 
meta-analysis of self-monitoring in the control of blood 
pressure, and to our knowledge, this is the first study to 
directly compare GPs titrating antihypertensives using 
self-monitoring with or without telemonitoring, with usual 
care in hypertensive patients, using appropriately lower 
home targets and followed-up for 12 months.10 Previous 
studies by Staessen and colleagues12 and Verberk and 
colleagues13 found worse clinic blood pressure control and 
less treatment when using identical treatment targets for 
both home and clinic blood pressures. The current study 
used nationally and internationally recommended self-
monitoring targets, 5 mm Hg lower for both systolic and 
diastolic values, and found better control and more 
utilisation of antihypertensive medication.
This work extends the evidence from McKinstry and 
colleagues15 using a telemonitoring based service design 
over 6 months by following up for a full year. Differences 
in blood pressure recorded at 6 months were amplified by 
a year suggesting that the intervention increased in efficacy 
in the second 6 months. The individual patient data meta-
analysis found that the intensity of self-monitoring co-
interventions was related to the effect on blood pressure 
and the quicker reduction in blood pressure with 
telemonitoring guided titration is in line with this.10 An 
economic analysis and qualitative study will follow this 
work and will be important in understanding the place of 
telemonitoring over and above self-monitoring in the 
management of hypertension.
No trial of self-monitoring to date has been powered for 
clinical events but blood pressure reduction is extremely 
well correlated with reduced morbidity and mortality.27 
Furthermore, self-monitored blood pressure is better 
correlated with cardiovascular outcomes than clinic 
blood pressure and so treatment guided by self-
monitoring might be expected to have at least the effect 
seen in clinic blood pressure trials, with the advantage 
of not unnecessarily treating white coat hypertension, 
whereas conversely addressing masked uncontrolled 
hypertension.33,35 Arrangements have been made to 
follow the patients in this trial in the longer term for 
mortality and, in combination with other trials, it might 
be possible to use these data to make judgments on the 
effect of self-monitoring interventions on hard outcomes. 
In the meantime, a very large multicentre, perhaps 
international, trial of self-monitoring would be needed to 
detect differences in such outcomes.
Telemonitoring reminded participants if they had not 
monitored sufficiently and prompted contact with their 
GP for out-of-range readings. Health-care professionals 
were provided with mean blood pressure (rather than 
having to calculate by hand) along with a graphical 
presentation of trends in blood pressure. This provision 
might be expected to be advantageous in situations 
where doctors feel overwhelmed by the quantities of 
data they are required to deal with on a daily basis. 
Whether such advantages over self-monitoring alone 
are clinically worthwhile will be informed by the 
economic analysis. The text-based telemonitoring 
system was simple and could be implemented in other 
health systems as it was not dependent on a particular 
mobile phone provider or clinical system. The feedback 
system could be adapted into a smartphone application 
and could be incorporated into clinical patient record 
systems. Furthermore, it might be expected to offer 
particular advantages to the working age population 
where telemonitoring might facilitate management and 
remote access to a physician.

By contrast, self-monitoring alone is simple, can be 
accomplished with a cheap validated monitor, and 
produced similar results to telemonitoring, albeit with less 
effect at 6 months. However, although the evidence 
supports use, the logistical problems of sending back 
results by post, and manual data processing and recording 
of results, suggests that compre 
hensive implementation 
outside a research study might be challenging.
Blood pressure self-monitoring is now commonplace in 
the UK and elsewhere and practised by at least 30% of 
people with hypertension.36,37 A recent survey of primary-
care physicians suggested that many are already taking 
advantage of self-monitored blood pressure results in a 
proportion of their patients and the current work provides 
evidence to underpin and expand this.11 Participants in 
both the self-monitoring and tele 
monitor 
ing groups 
reported equivalent quality of life compared with usual 
care and no increase in consultation rates. The success in 
controlling blood pressure from the use of self-monitoring 
to titrate antihypertensives, and a lack of adverse events, 
suggests that the technology is now ripe for wider 
implementation in daily practice and in national and 
international guidance. Other countries might need to 
consider changes in reimbursement systems that currently 
favour (and reward) face-to-face contact.38 Guidelines have 
recently recommended lower targets for most people with 
hypertension and self-monitoring provides one means of 
achieving better control, although it should be emphasised 
that the final mean blood pressures in both intervention 
groups suggest that a proportion of participants will still 
have been above even a 140/90 mm Hg target.39
Titration of antihypertensive medication in primary 
care using self-monitoring, with or without tele 
monitor-
ing, results in significantly lower blood pressure after 
1 year and using telemonitoring leads to lower blood 
pressure after 6 months. Self-monitoring can be rec-
ommended for the ongoing management of hyper 
tension 
in primary care in all patients who wish to use it, and will 
require provision of validated blood pressure monitors 
for home use, ideally with integrated tele 
monitoring 
systems. GPs should incorporate self-monitored readings 
into their titration of blood pressure medications.
