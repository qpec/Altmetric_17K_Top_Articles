Key Points
• A heteroclitic WT1
peptide vaccine is well
tolerated and induces
immunologic re-
sponses in most acute
myeloid leukemia pa-
tients post-CR1.
• Median overall survival
for the group of patients
vaccinated was not
reached but is poised
to reach or exceed 67.6
months.
A National Cancer Institute consensus study on prioritization of cancer antigens ranked the
Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) protein as the top immunotherapy target in cancer. We previously
reported a pilot study of a multivalent WT1 peptide vaccine (galinpepimut-S) in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) patients. We have now conducted a phase 2 study investigating this vaccine in
adults with AML in first complete remission (CR1). Patients received 6 vaccinations administered
over 10 weeks with the potential to receive 6 additional monthly doses if they remained in CR1.
Immune responses (IRs) were evaluated after the 6th and 12th vaccinations by CD41 T-cell
proliferation, CD81 T-cell interferon-g secretion (enzyme-linked immunospot), or the CD8-
relevant WT1 peptide major histocompatibility complex tetramer assay (HLA-A*02 patients
only). Twenty-two patients (7 males; median age, 64 years) were treated. Fourteen patients (64%)
completed $6 vaccinations, and 9 (41%) received all 12 vaccine doses. Fifteen patients (68%)
relapsed, and 10 (46%) died. The vaccine was well tolerated, with the most common toxicities
being grade 1/2 injection site reactions (46%), fatigue (32%), and skin induration (32%). Median
disease-free survival from CR1 was 16.9 months, whereas the overall survival from diagnosis has
not yet been reached but is estimated to be $67.6 months. Nine of 14 tested patients (64%) had an
IR in $1 assay (CD4 or CD8). These results indicated that the WT1 vaccine was well tolerated,
stimulated a specific IR, and was associated with survival in excess of 5 years in this cohort of
patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01266083.
Introduction
Immunotherapy is on the forefront of oncologic clinical research and patient care, with an ever increasing
number of cancer immunotherapeutics entering the clinic.1,2 Historically, this modality has long been
appreciated to be effective therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients as evidenced by the
improved outcomes for individuals undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT).3,4 Several investigators have attempted to mimic the effects of HSCT without actually
performing the transplant using cytokines, interferons, genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptor
T cells, and various vaccines.5-7
We have previously reported the results from a pilot study investigating the potential application of a
multivalent heteroclitic Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) peptide vaccine (galinpepimut-S [GPS]) in the treatment
of adult AML patients.8 The heteroclitic peptides within the vaccine bear a single amino acid substitution

 in key residues that are specifically designed to both enhance
antigenicity against and mitigate immune tolerance toward the
corresponding native WT1 peptide sequences expressed in tumor
cells and recognized by the host’s immune system.8 A second pilot
study using the same vaccine conducted in AML patients in second
complete remission (CR) as well as 2 other studies conducted in
patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma all showed promising
activity.9-11 This phase 2 study investigates the safety and efficacy of
GPS treatment in adult AML patients in first complete remission (CR1).
Materials and methods
Trial design
This was a phase 2 open-label study evaluating the safety and
efficacy of GPS in 22 patients with AML (www.clinicaltrials.gov
#NCT01266083). Patients were required to have histologic
confirmation of the diagnosis at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center according to standard criteria and to have WT1-positive
disease as assessed by a quantitative real-time reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for WT1 at the time of
enrollment on study. All patients were required (1) to be in CR1, (2) to
be within 2 years of achieving CR1, and (3) to have completed all
planned chemotherapy with adequate recovery of hematologic
counts.12,13 The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Memorial
Hospital Institutional Review Board and was conducted under a US
Food and Drug Administration investigational new drug application. All
patients gave written informed consent prior to enrolling in the study.
Vaccine formulation
The GPS formulation has previously been described in detail.8,14
Briefly, the vaccine consists of 4 WT1-derived peptides: a synthetic
heteroclitic short peptide to stimulate CD81 responses (WT1-A1),
2 native long peptides (331 and 427) to stimulate CD41 responses,
and a synthetic heteroclitic long peptide to stimulate both CD41
and CD81 cells (122A1). Immediately prior to administration, the
peptides were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with Montanide ISA 51 VG
(Seppic, Fairfield, NJ), an immune adjuvant.
Treatment plan
Patients received 6 vaccinations subcutaneously biweekly over a 10
week period. Vaccination sites were rotated between extremities.
Injection sites were also pre-stimulated with 70 mg granulocyte-
macrophage colony stimulating factor (Sargramostim; Bayer Health-
care Pharmaceuticals, Seattle, WA) injected subcutaneously on days
22 and 0 of each vaccination. Routine toxicity assessments were
conducted throughout the trial and were graded in accordance with
the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse
Events version 4.0. Bone marrow aspirates were examined for
morphology and were assessed following the 6th vaccination and
end of study or as clinically indicated. Potential effects on minimal
residual disease (MRD) were assessed at baseline and week 12 or at
relapse via RT-PCR for WT1 in bone marrow aspirates. Patients who
remained in CR were eligible to receive up to 6 more vaccinations (for
a total of 12) administered monthly.
Efficacy assessments
Clinical measures.
The protocol assumed a 3-year historical
overall survival (OS) rate of 20% to 25% in AML patients.15-17 It was
hypothesized the actual OS rate at 3 years from first vaccine
treatment would be $34% (ie, an absolute improvement of 9% to
14% or a relative benefit of 36% to 70%). This was the prespecified
efficacy threshold to justify further clinical investigations using the
vaccine to treat CR1 AML patients (ie, the primary end point of the
study). Median (actuarial) disease-free survival (DFS) and OS times
(in months), as well as landmark actuarial DFS and OS rates (%) at
6 and 9 months post-GPS were secondary end points.
Immune responses.
Immune responses (IRs) were evalu-
ated at baseline, after 6 vaccinations, following completion of each
patient’s extended vaccination period (ie, between 7 and 12 total
vaccinations for those patients who received .6 vaccinations), or
upon discontinuing therapy. Response was assessed by 1 or more
of the following methods: CD41 T cell proliferation, CD3/CD81
T cell interferon g (IFN-g) release measured by enzyme-linked
immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, or WT1/HLA-A*02:01 tetramer
staining to measure the CD81 T-cell response in HLA-A*02–
positive patients.
CD41 T-cell response.
CD41 T-cell response was mea-
sured using a standard CD41 lymphocyte proliferation assay
(supplemental Methods).8,18 The readout of this assay, which used
tritiated thymidine, was measured counts/min, and represented
mean values of quadruplicate microwell cultures per each sample
analyzed.
CD81 T-cell response.
To detect specific CD81 T cell
responses, 2 rounds of in vitro stimulations of CD31 T cells were
performed.8,14,19 Following stimulation and incubation, CD81
responses were then measured by IFN-g secretion of the cells
was examined by ELISPOT assay and/or tetramer staining
(supplemental Methods).
Measurement of WT1 transcript by RT-PCR. Measure-
ment of WT1 transcript was accomplished through methods
previously described.8,14,20
Statistics
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize continuous data
variables (eg, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and
maximum). Categorical data were summarized using counts and
percentages. All statistical tests were carried out at the 5%
significance level with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Kaplan-Meier
plots were used to illustrate trends in OS, event-free survival (EFS),
and DFS and time to event analyses were compared using the log
rank analysis methods calculated using either the LIFETEST
procedure of the Statistical Analysis System (Cary, NC) or
GraphPad Prism 7 software (La Jolla, CA).
Results
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics
A total of 22 patients (7 males, 15 females) were enrolled on the
study and were evaluable for response (Table 1). The median age
was 64 years (range, 25-76 years). Fifty percent (11/22) of study
patients had a normal karyotype. Ten of these patients (91%) had
further molecular testing, and 2 were found to have mutated NPM1
without a FLT-3 internal tandem duplication mutation. Using
cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, risk was stratified
according to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) prognostic scoring
system13; 8 (36%) were favorable, 10 (45%) were intermediate, 3
(14%) were adverse, and 1 (5%) had an undetermined risk status.

From 
 CD81 T cells in an HLA-dependent context, HLA genotyping data
were obtained for all patients prior to vaccination. Nine (41%)
patients were positive for the HLA-A*02:01 serotype, and these
were the only patients subsequently tested for CD81 IR. Overall,
95% of patients received an anthracycline-cytarabine induction
regimen, with 41% and 55% of patients receiving 1 or 2 and 3 or 4
postremission treatments, respectively. All patients completed any
planned upfront antileukemic therapy prior to study enrollment and
were in CR1 according to standard criteria.12,13 All patients had
measurable WT1 transcript levels in bone marrow cells at study
initiation. The median time in CR1 prior to receiving the GPS
vaccine was 8 months, with a range of 2 to 22 months.
Patient outcomes
Of the 22 patients, 14 (64%) received the planned 6 vaccinations
and 10 (46%) completed all 12 vaccinations. Overall, 15 (68%)
patients relapsed: 10 while receiving vaccine, 4 after the entire
series of 12 vaccinations, and 1 patient 13 months following
discontinuation of therapy secondary to a delayed- type hypersen-
sitivity reaction. Four of the 15 patients relapsed after 1 vaccination,
which is likely an insufficient amount of time to induce an IR. Ten
relapsed patients died due to complications from progressive
leukemia. Five of the 15 relapsed patients underwent HSCT
following successful reinduction chemotherapy. Three of these
patients remained alive without evidence of recurrent disease,
ranging from 11 to 31 months post-HSCT. There was no
statistically significant difference in either relapse rate or OS in
patients who were vaccinated prior to spending 8 months in CR1
compared with those vaccinated at or after this time point.
Survival from diagnosis, CR1, and first GPS treatment
From the first GPS treatments, 19 of 22 (86%) patients were
evaluable for survival at 3 years, and 9 of these 19 evaluable patients
(47%) were alive for $3 years. Consequently, the study met its
prespecified end point of $34% OS at 3 years, warranting additional
clinical investigations of the GPS vaccine in the treatment of AML.
From CR1, the median DFS was 16.9 months (Figure 1A). The
median OS from diagnosis (Figure 1B) was not reached but is
poised to reach or exceed 67.6 months (5.6 years by log-rank
analysis). The median EFS from the time of first GPS vaccination
was 9.4 months, whereas the median OS from the time of
vaccination has not been reached (Figure 1C-D). The probabilities
of EFS at 6 and 9 months postvaccine were 64% (CI, 40%, 80%)
and 54% (CI, 32%, 72%), respectively. Likewise, the probabilities of
OS at 6 and 9 months postvaccine were 100% (CI, 100%, 100%)
and 77% (CI, 54%, 90%), respectively.
Survival in subgroups
For patients ,60 years of age (n 5 9), neither the median DFS nor OS
time was reached (Figure 1E-F). However, for patients in the older
cohort (age $60 years; n 5 13), median DFS from CR1 was 10.8
months, and median OS time postdiagnosis was 35.8 months
(Figure 1G-H). Likewise, from the first GPS treatment, the median
EFS and OS times in the older cohort were 7.8 and 30.2 months,
respectively. Lastly, landmark EFS in the older cohort at 6 and 9 months
after the first GPS treatment was 54% (CI, 25%, 76%) and 46% (CI,
19%, 70%), respectively, whereas OS 6 and 9 months after the first
GPS were 100% (CI, 100%, 100%) and 62% (CI, 31%, 82%).
Stratifying OS from diagnosis according to ELN risk categories
yielded median OS times that were not reached in the favorable
(n 5 8) and the intermediate (n 5 10) groups and 11.9 months in
the adverse group (n 5 3). Median DFS from CR1 was 27.7, 20.5,
and 9.1 months for the favorable, intermediate, and adverse groups,
respectively. The median time for follow-up from diagnosis was
43 months, with a range of 10-68 months.
MRD
Baseline WT1 transcript measurements varied among the patients
(reported as absolute copy number; range, 1.37-252.9; mean,
64.9 6 76.11). Nineteen of 22 of the trial patients (86%) had serial
RT-PCR measurements available for analysis. There was no
correlation between baseline WT1 transcript levels and clinical
outcomes. Increases in WT1 transcript levels over baseline was
seen in 67% (8/12) of relapsed patients measured with a .1 log
increase in 50% (6/12) of these patients at the time of or shortly
before clinical relapse these. Although there was some variability
among transcript levels measured serially in the patients who remain
in CR1, 6 of 7 (86%) had either decreasing or stable (#1 log
change) transcripts compared with baseline at relatively low levels
of expression (supplemental Data; Figure 1).

From 
 All 22 patients had baseline immunophenotyping preformed using
a standard 4- to 6-color panel, which included myeloid, T-cell, and
B-cell markers. Only 1 of the 22 patients tested (4%) had a flow
cytometric evidence of aberrancy (supplemental Data).
IRs
Immunologic correlative data were available from 14 of the 22
patients (64%) accrued to the study.
CD41 response.
Nine patients were tested for a CD41 IR,
and 4 of these (44%) had a detectable IR. One patient responded
to all 4 peptides, 3 patients responded to the long peptide 331,
and 3 patients responded to the heteroclitic peptide 1221A1.
Representative data of the CD41 T-cell proliferation assay from
patient 4 are shown (Figure 2). Of the 5 patients who were
negative for CD41 response, 2 were tested at relapse following 1
vaccination. One other patient was tested following vaccine dose 6;
the results were negative, and this patient subsequently relapsed
following vaccine dose 9. Another patient was tested following
vaccine dose 6; the results were negative and remained negative at
repeat testing upon relapse following vaccine dose 11. No clear
correlation with HLA-DR subtype was seen among the responders,
although the number of patients expressing individual haplotypes
was too small to draw conclusions. Interestingly, none of the
patients who had a positive CD41 response in this assay relapsed.
CD81 response.
Seven of the 9 patients who were HLA-
A*02 positive were tested for a CD81 T-cell response to the native
WT1-A peptide, as well as the synthetic heteroclitic WT1-A1
peptide, by IFN-g ELISPOT assay or tetramer staining. Six of 7
patients (86%) had a positive CD81 IRs. These assays also
evaluated whether the vaccinating heteroclitic peptide (WT1-A1)
generated IRs against the native peptide (WT1-A). This cross-
reactivity is crucial to vaccine strategy, as cytotoxic T cells that are
induced need to recognize antigens in the form it exists in the
leukemia cells of the patient. All 5 patients tested with the ELISPOT
assay had significant increases in IFN-g secreting cells to the native
WT1-A peptide following vaccination. Representative responses
from 2 patients are shown in Figure 3.
The frequency of WT1-A–specific CD81 T cells was assessed by
tetramer staining in 5 patients. Two of the HLA-A*02–positive patients
tested demonstrated a small number of CD81 tetramers present at
baseline. Overall, 4 of 5 patients tested (80%) demonstrated increased
WT1-A tetramer-positive cells in the CD81 population after vaccina-
tion. Representative tetramer data from 2 patients are illustrated in
Figure 4. Three patients in the above group were also tested via
ELISPOT, and all 3 had a positive result with both assays.
Clinical outcomes were examined in the patients who had either a
CD41 or CD81 immunologic response (n 5 9) vs patients with no
response (n 5 5) in the correlative assays. There was no difference
in immunologic response between patients who had received 0 to 2
vs 3 or 4 cycles of postremission chemotherapy. Comparison of the
survival curves between the immunologic responders and nonre-
sponders show clear separation between groups for both DFS and
OS (Figure 5), although the small sample size precludes detecting a
statistically significant difference.
Safety and toxicity
The vaccine was generally well tolerated and the toxicity profile
consistent with other WT1 vaccine–adjuvant combinations21-25
(Table 2). The montanide adjuvant is a known irritant,26 and many of
the most frequent toxicities consisted of mild to moderate local
reactions and inflammation: injection site reaction (46%), fatigue
(32%), skin induration (32%), and injection site pruritus (27%).
These toxicities were self-limited and responded to local supportive
measures and analgesics. Several transient occurrences of de-
creased white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet
counts were noted; these resolved (often on the same day of
testing) and resulted in no significant infectious complications or
supportive transfusions. None of the patients developed significant
hepatic or renal insufficiency, and no episodes of systemic
anaphylaxis were observed. Other common toxicities are summa-
rized in Table 2.

Figure 2. CD41 T cell proliferation. CD41 T cells from prevaccination (time 0),
post-6 GPS vaccinations (time 6), and post-12 GPS vaccinations (time 12) from
patient 4 were incubated with indicated peptides at 20 mg/mL (“20”) or 50 mg/mL
(“50”) for 5 days, and 1 mCi [3H]-thymidine was added to the cultures for 20 hours.
The cell proliferation was determined by [3H]-thymidine incorporation. Data are
mean 6 SD from quadruplicate cultures. Negative controls were also used (incubation
with no peptide present and with irrelevant peptides [B2A2 long fragment of
BCR-ABL]). After 6 vaccinations, cell proliferation increased sixfold to 331, eightfold to
427, 11-fold to 122A1, and 13-fold to 122A (P 5 .008) There was no significant dose
dependency of the peptides, and the CD41 T-cell response was sustained through the
period of vaccination, although the degree varied among the individual peptides.

From 
 Two patients discontinued therapy due to probable hypersensitivity
reactions that were believed to be related to vaccination. One
patient developed 2 episodes of a maculopapular rash (grade 1)
and then developed, on a separate occasion, an episode of flushing
(grade 3) immediately following the second vaccine administration.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and developed no
signs of anaphylaxis, but, given the severity of the episode, he
discontinued further vaccinations. The patient subsequently re-
lapsed and died of complications of recurrent AML 29 months after
discontinuing vaccine therapy. The second patient developed bone
pain, dyspnea, flushing, and noncardiac chest pain (grade 3)
leading to hospitalization immediately following the fourth vaccine
dose. The patient responded to standard supportive measures, and
the symptoms resolved the same day without further incident. The
patient recovered without sequelae and remains alive as of the last
study follow-up (;36 months after discontinuing GPS).
Discussion
The WT1 protein has been highly rated as an immunologic target by
a National Cancer Institute prioritization project.27 Several groups
have vaccinated patients with WT1 peptides and reported both
immunologic
and
clinical
responses.21-23,28
Generally,
these
studies have used HLA-restricted class I peptides (either HLA-
A*02:01 or HLA-A*24:02) to elicit CD81 cytotoxic T lymphocyte
(CTL) responses. Potential therapeutic activity has been demon-
strated by both clinical response and decreases in measurable
MRD (WT1) transcript levels. These studies have supported the
hypothesis that the WT1 antigen is a validated immunologic target
that can be used to effectively treat myeloid malignancies.
Several challenges, however, exist for generating effective re-
sponses to oncofetal self-antigens, such as WT1. Although WT1 is
expressed at higher levels in neoplastic cells of a variety of types,
there may be low level expression in normal cells.20 The generation
of low-avidity CTLs may be favored as part of the normal physiologic
process of developing immunologic tolerance. As a consequence,
high-avidity CTLs, which should be more effective in responding to
tumor, are deleted from the T-cell repertoire early in development
and unavailable for recruitment in response to leukemia. Such a
scenario is supported in a study by Rezvani et al, where the effect of
serial vaccine boosters failed to generate the high-avidity CTLs
needed to establish long-term memory and a significant antileuke-
mia effect.24 Alternatively, Nakae et al have described decreased
responses among patients who harbor a population of effector
memory T cells, which they describe as having an “activated” state
according
to
gene
expression
profiling.29
T
cells
that
are
constitutively activated may represent an exhausted state and are
therefore unable to respond to an exogenous priming stimulus like a
vaccine peptide resulting in relative anergy.

Figure 3. IFN-g secretion by CD81 cells. CD31 T cells from
patient 1 (Pt. 1) 1 and patient 14 (Pt. 14) were stimulated with WT1-A
(native) peptide. IFN-g–secreting T cells were measured by ELISPOT
assay after challenge with indicated peptides. Controls were no peptide
(only CD141 antigen-presenting cells) or irrelevant Ewing sarcoma–
derived peptide (EW). Data are mean 6 SD from quadruplicate
cultures from before GPS administration (time 0), after 6 GPS
vaccinations (time 6), and after 12 GPS vaccinations (time 12). A
positive response was defined as meeting all of the following criteria:
(1) a twofold increase in the IFN-g–secreting cells and in frequencies
of CD81 WT1-A tetramer–positive cells over the controls, (2) P , .05,
and (3) .30 spots per 105 cells. Results indicate that a WT1-
A–specific response can be generated by challenge to both native and
heteroclitic peptide, suggesting processing and presentation of the
antigen. In patient 1, a stronger response was seen after 6 vaccinations
and then faded. In patient 14, a stronger response was seen after
12 vaccinations.

Percentage of tetramer-positive CD81 T cells (number shown in the top right of each histogram and highlighted in bold print) were gated on CD31 events after establishing a
lymphocyte gate. Cells from before vaccine (time 0 [T0]), after 6 GPS vaccinations (T6), and after 12 GPS vaccinations (T12) are shown. (A) CD81 cells only from patient 1
are shown. Cultures were preincubated with native (WT1-A) and heteroclitic (WT1-A1) peptides. The data are controls (no peptide [2]) on the left followed by representative
staining from triplicate cultures following antigen exposure (1) on the right. Before vaccination, there were low percentages of tetramer-positive cells in the CD81 population.
(B) Both CD81 and CD82 cells from patient 14 are shown. Cultures are incubated with WT1-A peptides. Bottom row of histograms show concurrent testing with irrelevant
tetramers. After vaccination, a large increase in the percentage of WT1-A–specific CD81 T cells was noted in primed cultures indicating that vaccination with the heteroclitic
peptide can induce T cells that recognize the native sequence.

From 
 Several strategies were adopted in designing the WT1 vaccine to
potentially address these issues. The vaccine contains both major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II peptides with the
synthetic heteroclitic analog WT1-A1 peptide designed primarily for
class I HLA-A*02:01, a type commonly expressed in the US
population. In addition, MHC peptide-binding algorithms predict
that multiple class I and II epitopes may also be found within the
sequences of the 4 peptides, if they are appropriately
processed.14,19 These include HLA -A*02:01, HLA-A*03, HLA-
A*24:02, HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*39:01, HLA-B*07:02, and HLA-
B*08,-B27:05, among others, and a wide array of HLA-DRB1
types covering much of the US population. The patients who
made responses to the vaccine in the 3 AML trials, including this
trial, were characterized by a widely heterogeneous group of HLA
types and subtypes.8,9 The substitution of a single amino acid in the
native WT1 sequence improves the immunogenicity of the vaccine
peptide by virtue of its improved binding affinity to HLA on antigen-
presenting cells, resulting in a more stable MHC/peptide complex
on the cell surface.19,30 The longer peptides were designed to
stimulate a broad range of class II molecules, allowing for more
widespread application across the population tested. While the
WT1-A1 peptide is designed to induce an enhanced CD81 CTL
response, the class II peptides will primarily stimulate CD41 helper
cells. The induction and maintenance of a memory CTL response
requires CD41 T cell help, and by providing for activation of both T-
cell subsets, we hoped to induce a more robust, long-lived IR that
could translate into clinical efficacy.31,32 Lastly, peptide 122A1
contains both CD41 and CD81 epitopes known to be immunoge-
nic within the same sequence.
With regard to safety in this study, a total of 22 patients were
treated and evaluable for response. Overall, WT1 vaccinations in
AML patients were safe and well tolerated, with a majority of TEAEs
being of mild or moderate severity (150/244 [61.5%]). There were
no reported deaths, and a majority of grade 3/4 TEAEs were
unrelated to study treatment. The majority of injection site reactions,
skin induration, and pruritus were easily managed with supportive
care. A single patient experienced a significant adverse event that
led to study discontinuation, and 1 additional patient discontinued
the study due to probable hypersensitivity reactions.
Although this is a relatively small phase 2 study enrolling 22
patients, several clinical observations regarding the potential for
therapeutic efficacy can be made. The study met its prespecified
end point of $34% actual OS rate at 3 years, justifying future clinical
investigations of this WT1 vaccine. The actual OS rate of 47.4% at 3
years postvaccine treatment exceeded historical published data of
20% to 25% by 2.4- to 1.9-fold (or 240% to 190%), respectively. In
addition, 11 of the 22 patients (50%) were alive at the time of their last
assessment. Nine of these remained in CR1, while 3 relapsed during
or following vaccine administration and were successfully salvaged
with HSCT. The median DFS from CR1 was 16.9 months, with the
median OS not reached, but poised to be at least 67.6 months. These
survival outcomes are superior to published results for similar patients
treated with conventional postremission therapies and compare
favorably to subsets of patients treated with HSCT.33-41
Six of the 7 HLA-A*02:01-type patients (86%) had a CD81
response as evidenced by a positive result in either the IFN-g ELISPOT
(5 of 5; 100%) or WT1-A tetramer assay (4 of 5; 80%). Four of the 9
patients tested (44%) for CD41 proliferative response had a positive
result. Seven of these patients were not HLA-A*02:01 type. There was
no clear correlation of CD41 proliferative response with HLA-DR type
suggesting reactivity across multiple HLA subtypes, but the numbers
are very small. Two of the patients were tested early upon relapse
following vaccine 1. Although both had a negative CD41 proliferative
response, one was of HLA-A*02:01 type and had an increase in WT1-A
tetramer staining to CD81 T cells. Despite the generation of CD81
CTLs, the patient had overt clinical relapse, again suggesting either
that the duration of exposure to the vaccine was inadequate to generate
a clinically sufficient response or that even early CD81 responses alone
are inadequate to generate an antileukemia effect. The one other HLA-
A*02:01–positive patient who underwent both CD41 and CD81
testing had positive results in both assays and is alive without evidence
of disease 71 months since diagnosis. One other patient with a negative
result remains in CR1 35 months after achieving remission.
Immunologic responses may translate into improved clinical out-
comes, as there is a suggestion of improved DFS and OS in patients
who had a positive result in one of the correlative assays. Although
this difference is not statistically significant given the small number of
patients treated in this study, the observation is intriguing enough to
warrant further study in the context of a larger randomized clinical trial.
There are, however, several potential caveats in interpreting the
results of this trial with regard to therapeutic efficacy. The study
group is relatively heterogeneous, with several different prognostic

outcomes.42 The patients enrolled in this study may represent
those with the best possible response in that they not only were
able to achieve CR1 but also remained in CR1 for a median of 8
months prior to vaccination. The immunologic correlates provide
information regarding biologic effect but are not surrogates for
clinical response. Several patients did not exhibit an IR yet still did
well. We do not know whether the negative results were false
negatives, as the assays are not sensitive or directed at most
relevant key epitopes, and not all technical issues regarding testing
of this type have been resolved to date.43
Despite these potentially confounding factors, this trial supports the
continued investigation of WT1 vaccination as a strategy for AML
postremission therapy. The vaccine can be administered on an
outpatient basis with minimal toxicity in most patients. This cohort of
patients appears to do well compared with historical outcome data,
and the immunologic correlates that have been used in this study show
the generation of an IR in most tested patients. The ultimate question of
clinical efficacy, however, will need to be addressed in a larger trial in a
more homogeneous patient population. A pivotal randomized study
addressing this question is planned in the near future.
