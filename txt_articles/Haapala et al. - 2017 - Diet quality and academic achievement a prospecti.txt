Abstract  
1 
Purpose: Poor diet quality may impair academic achievement in children, but such evidence is 
2 
limited. Therefore, we investigated the associations of healthy diet in Grade 1 assessed by 
3 
Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), Baltic Sea Diet Score (BSDS), and Finnish Children Healthy 
4 
Eating Index (FCHEI) with academic achievement in Grades 1–3 in children.  
5 
Methods: The participants were 161 Finnish children who were 6–8-year-old in Grade 1 and 
6 
attended in a large ongoing physical activity and dietary intervention study. Dietary factors were 
7 
assessed using 4-day food records and MDS, BSDS, and FCHEI were calculated. Academic 
8 
achievement was assessed by reading fluency, reading comprehension, and arithmetic skill tests. 
9 
The data were analyzed using linear regression analysis and analysis of covariance adjusted for age, 
10 
sex, parental education, household income, body fat percentage, physical activity, the PANIC Study 
11 
group, and total energy intake.  
12 
Results: MDS was positively associated with reading comprehension in Grade 3 (standardized 
13 
regression coefficient β=0.167, P=0.032). BSDS was positively associated with reading fluency in 
14 
Grades 2–3 and reading comprehension in Grades 1–3 (β=0.161 to 0.274, P<0.05). FCHEI was 
15 
positively related to reading fluency in Grades 1–2 and reading comprehension in Grades 1–3 
16 
(β=0.190 to 0.344, P<0.05). Children in the highest third of BSDS and FCHEI had better reading 
17 
fluency and reading comprehension in Grades 1–3 than children in the lowest third (P<0.05). None 
18 
of the diet scores was associated with arithmetic skills.  
19 
Conclusions: Healthier diet assessed by BSDS or FCHEI in Grade 1 was associated with better 
20 
reading skills, but not with arithmetic skills, among children in Grades 1–3. Long-term intervention 
21 
studies are needed to investigate the effects of improvements in diet quality on academic 
22 
achievement among children.

Introduction 
30 
Poor nutrition may impair the rapidly developing brain and cognitive functions and low quality diet 
31 
may also deteriorate children’s academic achievement [1]. Therefore, recent evidence suggesting 
32 
that children´s dietary patterns typically include a high intake of saturated fat and sucrose, a high 
33 
consumption of fast foods, and a low consumption of vegetables is alarming [2–6]. Poor academic 
34 
achievement in childhood has been linked to increased risk of adulthood obesity, unemployment, 
35 
and low socioeconomic positioning in adulthood, suggesting that it is important to identify 
36 
possibilities to support academic achievement in childhood [7–9].  
37 
A few studies suggest that a higher intake of some nutrients, such as iron and polyunsaturated fatty 
38 
acids, and a lower intake of saturated fatty acids are related to better cognitive functions and 
39 
academic achievement in children [10–13]. However, improvements in dietary patterns may be 
40 
more easily translated to real life conditions than those in single nutrients, because single nutrients 
41 
do not normally exist in isolation and are interrelated and synergistic [14, 15]. Although evidence 
42 
on the associations of dietary patterns with academic achievement is limited, some studies suggest a 
43 
direct relationship of adherence to the Mediterranean style diet assessed by the KIDMED index [16, 
44 
17], and the Healthy Eating Index [18] with academic achievement in children and adolescents. 
45 
Moreover, a dietary pattern including a high consumption of sausage, fast food, snacks, and sugar 
46 
sweetened beverages at the age of three years has been related to poorer academic achievement at 
47 
the age of 10 years among children [19]. 
48 
There are differences in food cultures and food choices between geographical regions and 
49 
populations. Although the Mediterranean style diet has frequently been used to describe healthy diet 
50 
[15], it may not be easily translated to other countries, such as the Nordic countries. The Baltic Sea 
51 
Diet Score (BSDS) [20] and the Finnish Children Healthy Eating Index (FCHEI) [21] were 
52 
developed  to illustrate a healthy dietary pattern in the Nordic countries, including Finland. We have 
53 
previously reported that a lower consumption of vegetables and a higher consumption of red meat 
54 
and sausage were related to poorer cognition but that poorer overall diet quality assessed by BSDS 
55 
had the strongest association with worse cognition in children and particularly in boys [22]. 
56 
However, there are no reports on the associations of BSDS or FCHEI with academic achievement in 
57 
children.  
58 
Due to the increased emphasis on education and learning, evidence on the associations of diet 
59 
quality with academic achievement among children would provide valuable information for schools 
60 
and parents to implement actions to support learning and academic achievement. We therefore 
61 
 4 
 
investigated the relationships of diet quality in Grade 1, assessed by the Mediterranean Diet Score 
62 
(MDS) [23], BSDS, and FCHEI, to academic achievement in Grades 1–3 among Finnish primary 
63 
school children. 
64 
Methods 
65 
Study design and study population 
66 
Data for the present analyses were obtained from the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children 
67 
(PANIC) Study [24] and the First Steps Study [25], two independent studies that are being 
68 
conducted simultaneously in the City of Kuopio, Finland.  The PANIC Study is an ongoing 
69 
controlled family-based and individualized physical activity and dietary intervention study in a 
70 
population sample of children. We invited 736 children 6–8 years of age who were in Grade 1 in 
71 
2007–2009 to participate in the baseline examinations of the study in that timeframe. Of the 736 
72 
invited children, 512 (70%) participated. The First Steps Study is an ongoing follow-up study in a 
73 
population-based sample of 2000 children from four municipalities in different parts of Finland that 
74 
was initiated in 2006. Altogether 207 children from the City of Kuopio participated both in the 
75 
PANIC Study and in the First Steps Study. We obtained data on dietary and confounding factors in 
76 
Grade 1 from the PANIC Study and data on reading and arithmetic skills in Grades 1–3 from the 
77 
First Steps Study. Complete data on variables used in the present analyses were available for 161 
78 
children (87 boys, 74 girls) in Grade 1, for 158 children (86 boys, 72 girls) in Grade 2, and for 152 
79 
children (83 boys, 69 girls) in Grade 3. 
80 
Children who were excluded from the present analyses because of incomplete data were less likely 
81 
to be at risk for reading disability (P=0.026) and had poorer reading comprehension in Grade 2 
82 
(P=0.002), a higher maximal workload in exercise test per lean body mass (P=0.021), and a higher 
83 
MDS score (P=0.013) than the included children.  
84 
The PANIC Study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital 
85 
District of Northern Savo, Kuopio, and the First Steps Study protocol was approved by the 
86 
Research Ethics Committee of the University of Jyväskylä. All participating children and their 
87 
parents provided their written informed consent. 
88 
Assessment of maturity and anthropometrics 
89 
All children underwent a clinical examination at baseline of the PANIC Study. A research physician 
90 
assessed pubertal status using the 5 stage criteria described by Tanner [26]. The boys were defined 
91 
 5 
 
as having entered clinical puberty, if their testicular volume assessed by an orchidometer was >3 ml 
92 
(Stage ≥2). The girls were defined as having entered clinical puberty if their breast development had 
93 
started (Stage ≥2). Body weight and height were measured using standard protocols described 
94 
earlier [24]. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was defined using age and sex-specific 
95 
reference values published by Cole and co-workers [27]. 
96 
Assessment of dietary factors 
97 
We assessed energy and nutrient intake and food consumption by food records administered by the 
98 
parents on four predefined consecutive days, including two weekdays and two weekend days (99%) 
99 
or three weekdays and one weekend day (1%) [24]. A clinical nutritionist gave detailed instructions 
100 
to the parents to record all food and drinks using household or other measures, such as tablespoons, 
101 
deciliters, and centimeters. The parents were also instructed to ask their children about food eaten 
102 
outside home. A clinical nutritionist asked about details of menus and recipes of food served at 
103 
schools and afternoon daycare from the catering company that provided the food for the schools. A 
104 
clinical nutritionist used all this information and also a picture booklet of portion sizes to complete 
105 
the missing information with the families at return [28]. Clinical nutritionists analyzed the food 
106 
records using the Micro Nutrica® dietary analysis software, Version 2.5 (The Social Insurance 
107 
Institution of Finland), that utilizes Finnish and international data on nutrient composition of foods 
108 
[29]. We computed MDS, BSDS, and FCHEI as described in Table 1, with higher score indicating 
109 
better diet quality. We assessed the number of meals per day based on data from the food records. 
110 
We classified breakfast, lunch, and dinner as meals and all eating and drinking occasions between 
111 
the meals as snacks. We categorized the children as those who had eaten all meals daily and those 
112 
who had skipped any of the meals. The Kappa coefficient was 0.134 (P=0.004) between MDS and 
113 
BSDS, 0.097 (P=0.023) between MDS and FCHEI, and 0.224 (P<0.001) between BSDS and 
114 
FCHEI, suggesting that these diet quality indices reflect different aspects of healthy diet.  
115 
Assessment of academic achievement 
116 
We assessed academic achievement at the spring semester of Grades 1, 2, and 3. Reading fluency 
117 
was assessed using a group-administered subtest of the nationally normed reading achievement test 
118 
battery for primary schools called Ala-asteen lukutesti (ALLU) in Finnish [30]. The test score was 
119 
the number of correct answers, ranging from 0 to 80, during a 2-minute time limit for items that 
120 
involved identifying the correct word from four phonologically similar alternatives linked to an 
121 
adjoining picture.  
122 
 6 
 
Reading comprehension was assessed using another group-administered subtest of the ALLU 
123 
battery [30]. After reading a short text, children were asked to answer to 12 multiple-choice 
124 
questions including facts, causal relationships, interpretations or conclusions drawn from the text. 
125 
The test score was the number of correct answers, ranging from 0 to 12, during the 30-minute test 
126 
period when children were allowed to refer to the original text.  
127 
Arithmetic skills were assessed using a basic arithmetic test with a set of visually presented addition 
128 
and subtraction tasks [31]. Children were asked to perform as many calculations as they could. The 
129 
test score was the number of correct answers, ranging from 0 to 28, during the 3-minute time limit.  
130 
Assessment of confounding factors 
131 
Physical performance, adiposity, physical activity, and socioeconomic status have been associated 
132 
with academic achievement in children [32–34]. The parents were asked to report their completed 
133 
or ongoing educational degrees and household income. The degree of the more educated parent was 
134 
used in the analyses. Maximal workload in exercise test per lean mass as an indicator of 
135 
cardiovascular performance [35], 50-meter agility shuttle run test time as a measure of motor 
136 
performance [36], body fat percentage and lean mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [37], 
137 
and physical activity [38, 39] were assessed in the PANIC Study as described previously.  The risk 
138 
of reading disability was determined in the First Steps Study using children’s scores in the 
139 
kindergarten-age assessments of letter knowledge, phonemic awareness, and rapid automatized 
140 
naming, and the parental self-report of reading difficulties [40]. The PANIC study group 
141 
(intervention vs. control) was used as a covariate, because the physical activity and dietary 
142 
intervention in the PANIC Study started before the assessments of academic achievement in the 
143 
First Steps Study.  
144 
Statistical methods 
145 
We performed all data analyses using the SPSS Statistics, Version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, 
146 
USA). We compared basic characteristics between boys and girls using the Student´s t-test and the 
147 
Chi Square-test. We investigated the associations of MDS, BSDS, and FCHEI in Grade 1 with 
148 
reading fluency, reading comprehension, and arithmetic skills in Grades 1–3 using linear regression 
149 
analysis by forcing MDS, BSDS, or FCHEI with age, sex, parental education, household income, 
150 
body fat percentage, physical activity, the PANIC Study group, and total energy intake into the 
151 
models. We also adjusted the data on the associations of MDI, BSDS, or FCHEI with reading and 
152 
arithmetic skills in Grades 2–3 for the corresponding academic skill in Grade 1. Furthermore, we 
153 
 7 
 
compared reading fluency, reading comprehension, and arithmetic skills in Grades 1–3 among 
154 
children in the thirds of MDI, BSDS, or FCHEI in Grade 1 using Repeated Measures Analysis of 
155 
Covariance. The data were adjusted for age, sex, parental education, household income, body fat 
156 
percentage, physical activity, the PANIC Study group, and total energy intake and Sidak correction 
157 
for multiple comparisons. All data were additionally adjusted for clinical puberty, maximal 
158 
workload in exercise test, 50-meter agility shuttle run test time, the risk of reading disability, or 
159 
skipping meals. We investigated the effect modification of sex using General Linear Models by 
160 
analyzing the association of sex*dietary quality index interactions with academic achievement 
161 
scores. We performed all analyses by combining data on boys and girls because of a limited 
162 
statistical power to analyze these associations separately in boys and girls and because sex did not 
163 
modify the associations of diet quality with academic achievement (P for interaction > 0.05 for all 
164 
models).  
165 
Results 
166 
Characteristics 
167 
The characteristics of the study sample are presented in Table 2. There were no differences in MDS, 
168 
BSDS, or FCHEI between boys and girls. The boys had poorer reading fluency in Grades 1 and 3, 
169 
and poorer reading comprehension in Grade 2 than the girls (data not shown).  
170 
Associations of MDS, BSDS, and FCHEI with academic achievement  
171 
MDS was associated with reading comprehension in Grade 3 after adjustment for age, sex, parental 
172 
education, household income, body fat percentage, physical activity, the PANIC study group, and 
173 
total energy intake (Table 3). A higher BSDS was related to better reading fluency in Grades 2–3 
174 
and reading comprehension in Grades 1–3 after adjustment for age, sex, parental education, 
175 
household income, body fat percentage, physical activity, the PANIC study group, and total energy 
176 
intake. A higher FCHEI was associated with better reading fluency in Grades 1–2 and reading 
177 
comprehension in Grades 1–3 after adjustment for age, sex, parental education, household income, 
178 
body fat percentage, physical activity, the PANIC study group, and total energy intake. The 
179 
relationship of BSDS to reading fluency in Grade 3 and the association of FCHEI with reading 
180 
fluency in Grade 2 were no longer statistically significant after further adjustment for reading 
181 
fluency in Grade 1, but the association of BSDS with reading fluency in Grade 2 and with reading 
182 
comprehension in Grades 2–3, the association of FCHEI with reading comprehension in Grades 2–
183 
3, and the association between MDS and reading comprehension in Grade 3 remained statistically 
184 
significant after further adjustment for corresponding reading skills in Grade 1 (data not shown). 
185 
 8 
 
Additional adjustment for clinical puberty, maximal workload in exercise test, 50-meter agility 
186 
shuttle run test time, the risk of reading disability, or skipping meals had no effect on these 
187 
associations (data not shown).  
188 
Differences in academic achievement among children in thirds of MDI, BSDS, and FCHEI  
189 
Children in the highest third of BSDS had consistently better reading fluency (mean difference 
190 
across Grades = 3.860; 95% CI = 0.089 to 7.631, P=0.043) and reading comprehension (mean 
191 
difference across Grades = 1.284; 95% CI = 0.200 to 2.368, P=0.015) in Grades 1–3 than children 
192 
in the lowest third after adjustment for age, sex, parental education, household income, body fat 
193 
percentage, physical activity, the PANIC study group, and total energy intake. Children in the 
194 
highest third of BSDS also had better reading comprehension in Grades 1–3 than children in the 
195 
middle third (mean difference across Grades = 1.086; 95% CI = 0.054 to 2.119, P=0.036). 
196 
Similarly, children in the highest third of FCHEI had consistently higher reading fluency (mean 
197 
difference across Grades 1–3 = 3.912; 95% CI = 0.027 to 7.796, P=0.048) and reading 
198 
comprehension (mean difference across Grades 1–3 = 1.894; 95% CI = 0.806 to 2.981, P<0.001) in 
199 
Grades 1–3 than children in the lowest third after adjustment for age, sex, parental education, 
200 
household income, and body fat percentage, physical activity, the PANIC study group, and total 
201 
energy intake. Moreover, children in the middle third of FCHEI had better reading comprehension 
202 
in Grades 1–3 than children in the lowest third (mean difference across Grades 1–3 = 1.034, 95% CI 
203 
= 0.049 to 2.018, P=0.036). Additional adjustments had no effect on these differences. There were 
204 
no other differences in academic skills among children in thirds of MDI, BSDS, or FCHEI.  
205 
Discussion 
206 
We found that better diet quality in Grade 1 assessed by BSDS and FCHEI was associated with 
207 
better reading skills among Finnish children. We also observed that children in the highest third of 
208 
BSDS and FCHEI had better reading skills through Grades 1–3 than children in the lowest third. 
209 
Moreover, our results provide some evidence that better diet quality is associated with better 
210 
reading skills in Grades 2–3 independent of reading skills in Grade 1.  
211 
Previous studies have shown that a better diet quality is associated with better grade point averages 
212 
and academic achievement reported by teachers in children and adolescents [16–18, 41]. Moreover, 
213 
dietary patterns characterized by a high consumption of vegetables, fruit, berries, fish, and nuts in 
214 
childhood and adolescence have been related to better cognitive functions and academic 
215 
achievement in later years in some follow-up studies [19, 42]. We found that better diet quality, 
216 
assessed by BSDS and FCHEI, was associated with better reading skills but not arithmetic skills. 
217 
 9 
 
These observations are supported by the results of the study of Sørensen and coworkers [43] in 
218 
which a 3 month intervention aimed to improving the quality of school meals improved reading 
219 
skills, but not arithmetic skills, in children 10 years of age. Our study with the study by Sørensen 
220 
and coworkers [43] are one of the first studies that have used standardized tests to assess specific 
221 
academic skills, such as reading and arithmetic skills, instead of overall grade point averages or 
222 
academic achievement reported by teachers. Taken together, the results of cross-sectional studies 
223 
and few prospective studies along with our observations suggest that better diet quality may 
224 
improve academic achievement, and particularly reading skills, during childhood and adolescence. 
225 
The reason why better diet quality has been linked to better reading skills but not arithmetic skills is 
226 
currently unknown. One reason for these observations may be that reading requires more complex 
227 
cognitive functions than basic arithmetic calculations and therefore unhealthy diet may be more 
228 
strongly related to reading skills than arithmetic skills in children. Nevertheless, more studies on the 
229 
specific effects of improved diet quality on reading and arithmetic skills in children are needed.  
230 
Although BSDS and FCHEI were positively associated with academic achievement, we found only 
231 
weak associations between MDS and academic achievement. This observation is in contrast to the 
232 
results of some earlier studies [16, 17]. One reason for these findings may be that the specific diet 
233 
quality indices developed for Nordic countries, such as BSDS and FCHEI, may more accurately 
234 
identify healthy diet related to academic achievement in our population with specific food choices 
235 
and culture than diet quality indices developed for other populations and geographical regions.  For 
236 
example, BSDS and FCHEI emphasize the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids and the 
237 
consumption low-fat milk whereas MDS gives emphasis to the ratio of monounsaturated to 
238 
saturated fatty acids and low consumption of milk. Milk is commonly fortified with vitamin D in 
239 
Finland, and it is the major dietary source of vitamin D among Finnish children [44]. Accordingly, 
240 
there is some evidence that polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin D support normal brain and 
241 
cognitive development in children [45, 46]. Another possible explanation for our findings is that the 
242 
median-based scoring in the MDS may not adequately classify children according to their diet 
243 
quality and may not cause the required variation in the score. Stricter adherence to the 
244 
Mediterranean style diet, assessed by the KIDMED index, has been related to better academic 
245 
achievement among children [16, 17]. However, we were unable to calculate the KIDMED index in 
246 
this study, because we used 4-day food records to assess dietary factors in children.  
247 
Stricter adherence to the Baltic Sea type diet has been linked to a higher intake of vitamins, 
248 
polyphenols, flavonoids, and dietary fiber and a lower intake of saturated fatty acids in adults [20]. 
249 
A higher FCHEI has been associated with a higher intake of vitamin E, vitamin D, polyunsaturated 
250 
 10 
 
fatty acids, and dietary fiber and a lower intake of saturated fatty acids in children [21]. These 
251 
nutrients may enhance synaptic plasticity [47, 48],  protect the brain from neuronal damage, support 
252 
cell proliferation [47], and improve the prerequisites for academic achievement, such as working 
253 
memory and inhibition [12, 13, 49]. There is also some preliminary evidence that a better breakfast 
254 
quality is associated with improved working memory, attention, and behavior in children [50, 51]. 
255 
Thus, better overall diet quality may improve cognitive prerequisites of learning and behavior 
256 
during school day over a long period of time and thereby enhance learning and academic 
257 
achievement in children. Furthermore, we found that skipping meals had no effect on the observed 
258 
associations between diet quality and academic achievement among children. 
259 
The strengths of the present study include the rigorous methods used to assess dietary factors by 4-
260 
day food records and academic achievement by standardized reading and arithmetic tests, and the 
261 
prospective study design. We also had the opportunity to control the data for a number of 
262 
confounding factors. The weaknesses of our study are that we could not draw a conclusion about 
263 
the causality of the associations. Moreover, we had a relatively small study sample although the 
264 
children quite well represented the original PANIC Study and the First Step Study populations. The 
265 
children also came from families with relatively high parental education, and therefore these 
266 
findings need to be confirmed among children with a lower socioeconomic background. 
267 
Furthermore, there were some differences in characteristics between the study sample and the 
268 
excluded children which may slightly decrease the generalizability of our results 
269 
All children entering public schools in Finland are eligible for free school-lunch that is prepared 
270 
according to the Finnish dietary recommendations [52]. Thus, all Finnish school-aged children 
271 
receive at least one healthy meal a day that includes vegetables, low-fat milk, and high-fiber grain 
272 
products. A healthy school lunch may attenuate the association of diet quality with academic 
273 
achievement, because it decreases differences in diet quality among children with different 
274 
socioeconomic backgrounds. Thus, the associations between diet quality and academic achievement 
275 
may be even stronger in other countries in which healthy meals are not provided by schools. 
276 
A higher BSDS and FCHEI were associated with better reading skills among children in their first 
277 
three school years. These results suggest that following the Nordic and Finnish dietary guidelines 
278 
[52] that results in increased consumption of vegetables, fruit, berries, and low-fat milk and 
279 
decreased consumption of red meat, sausage, and foods high in sucrose could improve reading skills 
280 
in school-aged children. Our results provide one of the first evidence on the longitudinal 
281 
 11 
 
associations of diet quality with academic achievement in children and can be used in planning 
282 
interventions aimed at increasing academic performance in children.
