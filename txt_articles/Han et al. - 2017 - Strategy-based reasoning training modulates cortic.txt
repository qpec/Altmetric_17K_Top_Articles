Abstract
Introduction: Prior studies have demonstrated training- 
induced changes in the healthy 
adult brain. Yet, it remains unclear how the injured brain responds to cognitive training 
months- 
to- 
years after injury.
Methods: Sixty individuals with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) were randomized 
into either strategy- 
based (N = 31) or knowledge- 
based (N = 29) training for 8 weeks. 
We measured cortical thickness and resting- 
state functional connectivity (rsFC)  
before 
training, immediately posttraining, and 3 months posttraining.
Results: Relative to the knowledge- 
based training group, the cortical thickness of the 
strategy- 
based training group showed diverse temporal patterns of changes over mul-
tiple brain regions (pvertex < .05, pcluster < .05): (1) increases followed by decreases, 
(2) monotonic increases, and (3) monotonic decreases. However, network- 
based sta-
tistics (NBS) analysis of rsFC among these regions revealed that the strategy- 
based 
training group induced only monotonic increases in connectivity, relative to the 
knowledge- 
based training group (|Z| > 1.96, pNBS < 0.05). Complementing the rsFC 
results, the strategy- 
based training group yielded monotonic improvement in scores 
for the trail- 
making test (p < .05). Analyses of brain–behavior relationships revealed 
that improvement in trail- 
making scores were associated with training- 
induced 
changes in cortical thickness (pvertex < .05, pcluster < .05) and rsFC (pvertex < .05, 
 
pcluster < .005) within the strategy- 
based training group.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that training- 
induced brain plasticity continues 
through chronic phases of TBI and that brain connectivity and cortical thickness may 
serve as markers of plasticity.

1 | INTRODUCTION
A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by external force (e.g., blast or 
fall) to the head, leading to disruptions in brain structure and func-
tion. TBI is a substantial threat to public health in the United States, 
contributing to 30% of all injury deaths (Faul, Xu, Wald, & Coronado, 
2010). In 2010, 2.5 million emergency room (ER) visits, hospitaliza-
tions, or deaths were associated with TBI in the United States (http:/
/
www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/get_the_facts.html). Individuals at 
the chronic stage of TBI (>6 months postinjury) often have cognitive 
difficulties such as problems with attention, memory, or executive 
functions, which are critical to carrying out daily life tasks (Arciniegas, 
Held, & Wagner, 2002; Rabinowitz & Levin, 2014). As the devastating 
effects of TBI- 
related cognitive challenges persist in the lives of mil-
lions of individuals, a recent Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) report to Congress emphasized the need for more TBI rehabil-
itation research that will improve the lives of individuals with TBI and 
their families (Frieden, Houry, & Baldwin, 2015).
TBI rehabilitation research is increasing, which has revealed some 
major challenges related to studying TBI populations. These challenges 
include: (1) the heterogeneity of TBI and (2) limitations of conven-
tional behavioral measures and neuroimaging techniques to identify 
the TBI- 
related abnormalities and changes after rehabilitation in this 
population. TBI is heterogeneous in terms of causes of injuries (e.g., 
blast, fall, sports related, blunt, and combinations thereof), locations 
of injuries, and injury types (Saatman et al., 2008). Furthermore, indi-
viduals with TBI frequently have comorbid psychiatric conditions such 
as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Ashman et al., 
2004; Hibbard, Uysal, Kepler, Bogdany, & Silver, 1998; van Reekum, 
Bolago, Finlayson, Garner, & Links, 1996), and this comorbidity af-
fects the brain and neuropsychological performance (Han, Chapman, 
& Krawczyk, 2015; Hudak, Hynan, Harper, & Diaz- 
Arrastia, 2012; 
Hudak et al., 2011; Lindemer, Salat, Leritz, McGlinchey, & Milberg, 
2013; Lopez et al., 2016; Spielberg, McGlinchey, Milberg, & Salat, 
2015), exacerbating the heterogeneity challenge. Accordingly, behav-
ioral performance of individuals with TBI, measured by neuropsycho-
logical tests, is heterogeneous (Goldstein, Allen, & Caponigro, 2010; 
Tellier et al., 2009; Thaler et al., 2013). In the context of rehabilitation, 
heterogeneity is further increased by variation in responses to reha-
bilitation. Regarding the sensitivity of conventional measures, initial 
injury severity as measured by instruments such as the Glasgow coma 
scale (GCS) (Teasdale & Jennett, 1974) has limitations for explaining 
the functional deficits of individuals with TBI at the chronic stage (Katz 
& Alexander, 1994; Zafonte et al., 1996). CT scanning also has limited 
ability to identify TBI- 
related abnormalities (e.g., Tellier et al., 2009). 
Neuropsychological tests have also been criticized for the lack of eco-
logical validity, meaning the test scores do not adequately reflect daily 
function levels (Burgess et al., 2006).
Advanced neuroimaging techniques using magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) such as morphometry (Ashburner & Friston, 2000; 
Fischl & Dale, 2000) and resting- 
state functional connectivity (rsFC) 
MRI (Biswal, Yetkin, Haughton, & Hyde, 1995) allow us to identify 
TBI with better sensitivity and precision. MRI- 
based morphometry 
has revealed altered cortical thickness and volume within individuals 
who have sustained a TBI (Bendlin et al., 2008; Gale, Baxter, Roundy, 
& Johnson, 2005; Kim et al., 2008; Sidaros et al., 2009; Spitz et al., 
2013; Tate et al., 2014; Turken et al., 2009; Warner et al., 2010; Zhou 
et al., 2013). These altered cortical morphometric properties are fre-
quently associated with functional deficits (Gale et al., 2005; Palacios 
et al., 2013; Sidaros et al., 2009; Spitz et al., 2013; Warner et al., 2010; 
Zhou et al., 2013), and correspondences between MRI- 
based and his-
tological morphometric data of TBI individuals have been reported 
(Maxwell, MacKinnon, Stewart, & Graham, 2009). RsFC MRI measures 
the temporal coherency of blood oxygenation level- 
dependent (BOLD) 
signal at rest and it allows us to identify how the brain’s intrinsic func-
tional networks are organized (see van Dijk et al., 2010 for review). 
Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) (Smith, Meaney, & Shull, 2003) is a primary 
injury mechanism of TBI, and rsFC has been a promising technique to 
identify DAI- 
induced higher- 
order cognitive impairments (e.g., reason-
ing, decision making, and selective attention) among individuals with 
TBI (Sharp, Scott, & Leech, 2014). Notably, large- 
scale network ap-
proaches using rsFC in TBI have effectively revealed the complex pat-
terns of the injured brain (Han, Chapman, & Krawczyk, 2016; Mayer, 
Mannell, Ling, Gasparovic, & Yeo, 2011; Sharp et al., 2011). The large 
established literature in large- 
scale networks in healthy individuals fa-
cilitates the interpretation of study findings as applied to individuals 
after a TBI.
In the context of TBI rehabilitation, morphometry and rsFC may 
also provide sensitive and precise measures to overcome aforemen-
tioned challenges in TBI research given the reported utility of these 
methods for studying training- 
induced neuroplasticity (see Guerra- 
Carrillo, Mackey, & Bunge, 2014; Kelly & Castellanos, 2014; May & 
Gaser, 2006 for review). MRI- 
based morphometry has enabled us to 
noninvasively and quantitatively assess training- 
induced structural 
changes in the healthy adult brain (Best, Chiu, Liang Hsu, Nagamatsu, 
& Liu- 
Ambrose, 2015; Bezzola, Merillat, Gaser, & Jancke, 2011; 
Draganski et al., 2004, 2006; Engvig et al., 2010; Ilg et al., 2008; Kwok 
et al., 2011; Landi, Baguear, & Della- 
Maggiore, 2011; Schmidt- 
Wilcke, 
Rosengarth, Luerding, Bogdahn, & Greenlee, 2010; Takeuchi et al., 
2011, 2014; Taubert et al., 2010; Woollett & Maguire, 2011). For ex-
ample, Engvig et al. (2010) observed that memory training reversed re-
ductions in cortical thickness in older adults. Quantitative MRI- 
based 
morphometry further revealed experience- 
dependent brain plasticity 
in clinical populations such as balance training for Parkinson’s disease 
(Sehm et al., 2014) and physical activity for heart failure, Schizophrenia, 
and mild cognitive impairment (Alosco et al., 2015; McEwen et al., 
2015; Reiter et al., 2015). Training- 
induced changes in resting- 
state 
networks in the healthy adult brain have also been reported following 
motor training (Lewis, Baldassarre, Committeri, Romani, & Corbetta, 
2009; Taubert, Lohmann, Margulies, Villringer, & Ragert, 2011), cogni-
tive training (Jolles, van Buchem, Crone, & Rombouts, 2013; Mackey, 
Miller Singley, & Bunge, 2013; Takeuchi et al., 2013), and physical ac-
tivity in the elderly (Voss, 2010). In clinical populations, rsFC has also 
been used to identify changes in resting- 
state networks induced by 
rehabilitation for multiple sclerosis (de Giglio et al., 2016) and stroke 
(Fan et al., 2015; Varkuti et al., 2013).

HAN et Al.
In our previous study, we reported the efficacy of strategy- 
based 
reasoning training for chronic TBI (Vas et al., 2016). Although that 
study contributed to the literature in rehabilitation for TBI, it primarily 
focused on assessing the neuropsychological performance of individ-
uals with chronic TBI following the strategy- 
based reasoning training. 
Given the limited sensitivity and heterogeneity of neuropsychological 
test scores of individuals with chronic TBI, assessing training- 
induced 
changes in the brain utilizing advanced neuroimaging techniques such 
as morphometry and rsFC may provide better sensitivity and higher 
precision. Furthermore, in light of previous morphometry and rsFC 
studies in TBI, the use of these methods could enable us to better 
understand the underlying mechanisms of training- 
induced changes in 
individuals with chronic TBI.
There is currently a limited literature addressing changes in the 
brain following rehabilitation for chronic TBI. Thus, multimodal ap-
proaches combining both morphometry and rsFC would strengthen 
the efforts to elucidate potential mechanisms of training- 
induced neu-
roplasticity of individuals with chronic TBI. While changes in morphom-
etry following training can confirm that the adjustment of behavior 
modulates brain structure, the temporal patterns of training- 
induced 
changes in morphometry are often complex. As such, the directionality 
of these changes has varied across previous studies (Draganski et al., 
2006; Maguire et al., 2000; Metzler- 
Baddeley, Caeyenberghs, Foley, & 
Jones, 2016; Taubert et al., 2010). RsFC can complement morphom-
etry to better understand the complex patterns of changes occurring 
after training. RsFC can also address a question whether spatially 
distributed morphometric changes are also accompanied by a reor-
ganization of the architecture of functional networks. For example, 
Taubert et al. (2011) have reported changes in gray matter volumes 
using a centrality measure of rsFC (i.e. strength of connectivity of a 
voxel with rest of the voxels) after balance training in the left sup-
plementary and presupplementary motor areas, indicating that local-
ized training- 
related changes in the gray matter accompany changes 
in rsFC over distributed brain regions in healthy adults. The question 
whether spatially diffuse changes in morphometry are accompanied 
by reorganization of networks is also critical in the context of TBI as 
(1) network dysfunction is one of the key mechanisms that explains 
impairments in high- 
order cognitive functions following TBI (Sharp 
et al., 2014) and (2) a TBI markedly disrupts between- 
network con-
nectivity of the brain, yielding less efficient brain communication after 
an injury (Han et al., 2014, 2016). These characteristics of TBI suggest 
that it would be interesting to determine whether structural changes 
following training accompany network reorganization in individuals 
with TBI. Taken together, identifying changes in rsFC in conjunction 
with morphometry of individuals with chronic TBI following training 
would improve our understanding of training- 
induced neuroplasticity 
in chronic TBI.
In this study, we utilized structural MRI and resting- 
state functional 
MRI (rsfMRI) to identify the effects of a strategy- 
 versus a knowledge- 
based training on cortical thickness and rsFC within individuals at 
the chronic stage of TBI. Specifically, we randomized individuals with 
chronic TBI into two 8- 
week training groups (strategy based vs. knowl-
edge based), and we acquired their MRI scans over three time points 
(prior to training, after training and at 3- 
month follow- 
up after train-
ing ended). We then investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of 
training- 
induced changes in cortical thickness and rsFC within these 
individuals. Based on findings from previous studies in neuroplasticity 
in healthy adults and reported efficacy of strategy- 
based reasoning 
training for chronic TBI, we hypothesized that the strategy- 
based rea-
soning training method would induce changes in cortical thickness 
relative to the knowledge- 
based training. We further hypothesized 
that the reasoning training would also induce changes in rsFC among 
regions where cortical thickness changes in chronic TBI cases.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Participants
The data included in these analyses are a part of an ongoing study 
(Krawczyk et al., 2013). We analyzed 60 individuals at the chronic 
stage of TBI who ranged from lower moderate disability to lower good 
recovery (age 20–65; >6 months postinjury; 5–7 on the Extended 
Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS- 
E; Wilson, Pettigrew, & Teasdale, 
1998), who completed MRI scans that passed the quality assurance 
(QA) procedures described below. We recruited these participants 
from the Dallas–Ft. Worth community and conducted a phone screen-
ing interview before inclusion in the study. The primary causes of TBIs 
in this group were blasts, blunt force trauma, falls, athletic impacts, ve-
hicle accidents, or combinations thereof. Note that, given the number 
of years postinjury time, it was not feasible to obtain participants’ clin-
ical information on initial injury characteristics such as Glasgow coma 
scale (GCS; Teasdale & Jennett, 1974) from the inpatient, acute- 
care 
facilities where they were hospitalized several years ago. Therefore, 
initial injury severity was retrospectively estimated utilizing the Ohio 
State University TBI identification (OSU TBI- 
ID) method (Corrigan 
& Bogner, 2007). The OSU TBI- 
ID method has good interrater reli-
ability and test–retest reliability (Bogner & Corrigan, 2009; Corrigan 
& Bogner, 2007). Furthermore, the OSU TBI- 
ID method estimates 
initial injury severity based on participants’ recollections of the inci-
dents including the estimated duration of loss of consciousness (LOC), 
and the CDC guidelines for the conceptual definition and identifica-
tion of TBI (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2003; 
Thurman, Sniezek, Johnson, Greenspan, & Smith, 1995). Specifically, 
the participants whose estimated LOC duration <30 min, <24 hr, or 
>24 hr were considered to be probable mild, probable moderate, or 
probable severe TBI, respectively. Both civilian and veteran partici-
pants were included (See Table 1 for demographics). No participants 
had a history of any significant, clinically diagnosed neurological or 
psychiatric comorbidities. We also confirmed that all participants’ 
brains did not show visible focal lesions, contusions, mass shifting, or 
extreme degeneration of white matter on structural MRI scans (see 
Figure S1 for an example scan that was not included in this study due 
to white matter degeneration). This confirmation should minimize the 
potential effects of such macrostructural injuries on preprocessing 
for cortical surface reconstruction and rsFC analyses. All participants 
provided written informed consent, and this study was conducted in 
 4 of 27  |

compliance with the declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Texas at Dallas 
and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
All participants underwent one of the two training groups: (1) a 
strategy- 
based reasoning training called Strategic Memory Advanced 
Reasoning Training (SMART) group (N = 31) or (2) the knowledge- 
based training called Brain Health Workshop (BHW) group (N = 29). 
To prevent any potential, systematic effects of out- 
of- 
scanner vari-
ables (such as injury characteristics and other demographics) on our 
findings, we randomly assigned all participants into either the SMART 
or BHW groups. Both training programs comprised of 12 sessions 
(1.5 h per session) for 8 weeks with quizzes, homework assignments, 
and projects conducted in small group settings, comprising of 4–5 
participants. Briefly, the SMART group focused on selective atten-
tion, abstract reasoning, and other thinking strategies (Vas, Chapman, 
Cook, Elliott, & Keebler, 2011), and the BHW group focused on edu-
cation regarding brain structure and function and the effects of sleep 
and exercise on the brain performance (Binder, Turner, O’Connor, & 
Levine, 2008). More specifically, the SMART participants were trained 
to (1) manage information by blocking distractions and irrelevant in-
formation and avoid multitasking, (2) increase the ability to under-
stand main ideas and take- 
home messages from information, and 
(3)  
examine  
information from different perspectives. This set of strat-
egies is aimed to improve cognitive control and enhance information 
processing (goal management). The SMART strategies are introduced 
in slides presented by a trained clinician. Each of the strategies was 
sequentially introduced and then reinforced throughout the training 
sessions. Example materials to practice the strategies included news-
paper articles and audio–video clips. The BHW participants learned 
about brain anatomy, brain function, the effects of a TBI on cognitive 
function, the principles of neuroplasticity, and the impact of diet, phys-
ical exercise, sleep, and social activities on brain health through slides 
taught by a clinician. The participants were also encouraged to discuss 
applications of learned information to their daily lives. To control for 
the effects of group- 
based social activities on training outcomes, we 
maintained an equal number of participants for each training group 
during their training sessions. Both training programs were conducted 
at The University of Texas at Dallas Center for BrainHealth®. See Vas 
et al. (2016) for more detailed descriptions of the SMART and BHW 
programs.
2.2 | Neuropsychological assessments
We administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to measure 
training- 
induced cognitive changes in a variety of domains for the 
TBI subgroups. As the SMART is aimed at improving multiple do-
mains of cognitive functions of individuals with TBI, we did not focus 
narrowly on assessments. Rather, we administered a battery of neu-
ropsychological tests probing executive functions of the participants 
to enable a more exploratory analysis. These tests include full- 
scale 
intelligent quotient- 
2 (FSIQ- 
2) from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale 
of Intelligence (WASI) for estimated current IQ (Wechsler, 1999), 
FSIQ from the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) for estimated 
premorbid IQ (Wechsler, 2001), and color–word, verbal fluency, card 
sorting, trail making from the Delis- 
Kaplan Executive Function System 
(D- 
KEFS) for inhibitory control, switching, verbal fluency, processing 
speed, and problem solving (Delis, Kaplan, & Kramer, 2001). We also 
acquired tests that measure psychiatric symptoms of the individu-
als with TBI as there are relatively common concomitant psychiatric 
symptoms after TBI (Ashman et al., 2004; Hibbard et al., 1998; van 
Reekum et al., 1996). To quantify subclinical-but-residual depressive 
and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity of the 
participants, we measured the Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI- 
II) 
(Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) and PTSD Check List Stressor–specific 
(PCL- 
S) (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993). We also ad-
ministered the satisfaction with life scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & 
Griffin, 1985) to measure global cognitive judgments of the partici-
pants’ life satisfaction.
2.3 | MRI data acquisition
We acquired MRI scans of the participants at three time points: prior to 
training (TP1), after training (TP2), and 3 months later (TP3). Participants 
underwent structural MRI scans in a Philips Achieva 3T scanner 
(Philips Medical Systems, Netherlands) at the Advanced Imaging 
Research Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center. In each imaging session, T1- 
weighted sagittal Magnetization 
Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) images were 
acquired using a standard 32- 
channel head coil (Repetition Time 
(TR)/Echo Time (TE) = 8.1/3.7 m; Flip Angle (FA)  = 12°; Field of View

(FOV)  =  25.6 × 25.6 cm; matrix = 256 × 256; 160 slices, 1.0 mm 
thick). In this imaging session, one or two 416- 
s runs of rsfMRI scans 
were also acquired using the same head coil using a T2*- 
weighted image 
sequence (TR/TE = 2000/30 ms; FA = 80°; FOV = 22.0 × 22.0 cm; 
matrix = 64 × 64; 37 slices, 4.0 mm thick). Total number of rsfcMRI 
runs was different across the participants because, at the early stage 
of our study, we observed that the QA procedures with only one 
rsfMRI run yielded high rates of participant exclusion. Thus, we ad-
ditionally acquired two rsfMRI runs for the remainder of the data col-
lection. Refer to the rsfMRI data analysis section for our strategy to 
account for differences in total number of rsfMRI scans across the 
participants. During rsfMRI acquisition, the participants were asked to 
remain still with their eyes closed.
2.4 | Cortical thickness analysis
2.4.1 | Cortical surface reconstruction and cortical 
thickness measurement
We reconstructed the cortical surface from each of the MRI scans 
with FreeSurfer v.5.3.0 (RRID:SCR_001847; http://surfer.nmr.mgh.
harvard.edu/). The technical details of cortical surface reconstruc-
tion procedures have been described elsewhere (Dale, Fischl, & 
Sereno, 1999; Fischl, 2012; Fischl, Sereno, & Dale, 1999). After we 
obtained the gray/white boundary and pial surface estimations (Dale 
& Sereno, 1993; Dale et al., 1999), cortical thickness was calculated 
as the closest distance between these surfaces at each vertex across 
the cerebral cortex (Fischl & Dale, 2000). The cortical surfaces were 
reconstructed using spatial intensity gradients across tissue classes, 
thus the measurements were not simply dependent on absolute signal 
intensity. Note that the surface- 
based cortical thickness maps were 
not restricted by the voxel size, which enabled us to detect changes 
in cortical thickness at submillimeter level. Furthermore, procedures 
to measure cortical thickness using Freesurfer have been validated 
against histological analysis (Rosas et al., 2002) and manual measure-
ments (Kuperberg et al., 2003; Salat et al., 2004). Lastly, Freesurfer 
morphometric procedures have been demonstrated to show good 
test–retest reliability across scanner manufacturers and field strengths 
(Han et al., 2006; Reuter, Schmansky, Rosas, & Fischl, 2012).
2.4.2 | Longitudinal analysis of cortical thickness
We utilized the longitudinal processing stream (Reuter et al., 2012) in 
FreeSurfer to obtain a reliable longitudinal analysis of cortical thick-
ness. Specifically, an unbiased within- 
subject template was created 
using robust, inverse- 
consistent registration (Reuter, Rosas, & Fischl, 
2010). Several processing steps, such as skull stripping, Talairach trans-
forms, atlas registration, and spherical surface maps and parcellations, 
were initialized with common information from the within- 
subject 
template. This procedure yielded significant increases in reliability 
and statistical power (Reuter et al., 2012). This longitudinal process-
ing pipeline also prevented potential bias with respect to any specific 
point, which is an important issue in longitudinal studies evaluating 
training- 
related structural changes within the brain (Thomas & Baker, 
2013). For group analysis, we resampled cortical thickness for each of 
the scans on a standard template, followed by surface smoothing with 
a 10- 
mm full- 
width- 
at- 
half- 
maximum Gaussian kernel.
With the preprocessed longitudinal data, we performed the lin-
ear mixed effects model (LME; Bernal- 
Rusiel, Greve, Reuter, Fischl, & 
Sabuncu, 2013) analysis using a piece- 
wise linear model with a break-
point at TP2 and a randomly varying intercept. Specifically, the cortical 
thickness of subject i at time point j, yij, can be written as:
where tij is the time of measurement for subject i at time point j, ̃
t is 
an average time of measurement at TP2, Si is an indicator function 
for the SMART group for subject i, bi is a subject- 
specific intercept 
(cortical thickness of subject i at TP1), Ai is the age for the subject i, 
̄
B is the average BDI score over time for the subject i, Bij is the BDI 
score for the subject i at time point j, eij is the measurement error for 
subject i at time point j, and H(·) represents the Heaviside step func-
tion. Previous studies reported the effects of comorbid psychiatric 
conditions on cortical thickness of individuals with TBI (Hudak et al., 
2011; Lindemer et al., 2013). Thus, we controlled for potential effects 
of depressive symptoms on cortical thickness by including between- 
 
and within- 
subject BDI covariates in the model. We did not include 
PCL- 
S covariates in the model, as BDI and PCL- 
S scores were highly 
correlated.
We utilized the LME as opposed to the repeated measures analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) because the repeated measures ANOVA is less 
optimal for analyzing longitudinal data. A repeated measures ANOVA 
does not properly model the covariance structure of serial measure-
ments when the covariance among repeated measurements and vari-
ance are not constant across time (i.e., the violation of the compound 
symmetry assumption). Furthermore, the repeated measures ANOVA 
cannot handle other common data characteristics present in a longitu-
dinal study. These include nonuniform data acquisition timing from the 
baseline across datasets and subject attrition. The LME is an extension 
of the general linear model to handle longitudinal data by incorpo-
rating subject- 
specific random factors into the model. The LME pro-
vides both flexible and parsimonious models for the covariance, and 
it is more appropriate for longitudinal data with increased specificity, 
sensitivity, and reliability than other alternatives (Bernal- 
Rusiel et al., 
2013; Chen, Saad, Britton, Pine, & Cox, 2013).
We performed subsequent statistical inferences for the with-
in- and between- 
group contrasts of cortical thickness at (1) TP2 
relative to TP1 (i.e., H0: y(TP2)–y(TP1) = 0), (2) TP3 relative to TP2 
(i.e., H0: y(TP3)−y(TP2) = 0), (3) monotonic changes over three time 
points (i.e., H0: (y(TP2)−y(TP1))+(y(TP3)−y(TP2)) = y(TP3)−y(TP1) = 0)), 
and (4) nonmonotonic changes over three time points (i.e., H0: (y(TP2)− 
y(TP1)) + (y(TP2)−y(TP3)) = 0), 
respectively.

points (i.e., monotonic or nonmonotonic changes) at pvertex < .05 
and pcluster < .05. To determine which group(s) drove statistically 
significant between- 
group differences, we then used the results of 
the within- 
group contrasts for changes over all three time points. If 
the corrected version of the within- 
group contrast results did not 
clearly reveal which group(s) accounted for the observed between- 
group differences, we further assessed an uncorrected version 
(pvertex < .05) of the within- 
group contrast results. We assessed 
 
contrasts for changes in two successive time points to confirm the 
patterns of training- 
related change over all time points.
2.4.3 | Post hoc regions- 
of- 
interest analysis of 
cortical thickness
To confirm that the statistically significant changes in cortical thickness 
following training were not occurring due to outliers, we identified 
training- 
induced cortical thickness trajectories at the single- 
subject 
level. More specifically, we obtained an average cortical thickness of 
each participant within each of the cortical regions where statistically 
significant between- 
group differences in overall temporal changes in 
cortical thickness occurred at the vertex level. Within each of these 
cortical regions, we also counted how many participants showed sig-
nificant changes in cortical thickness compared to the other training 
group. We defined a significant training- 
induced change in cortical 
thickness in a given region for a participant if the amount of corti-
cal thickness change fell outside of the 2 SD band obtained from the 
distribution of cortical thickness changes for the other training group. 
Note that, in this analysis, we did not perform any additional statistical 
tests (thus no subsequent p- 
values) for the regions identified by the 
group analysis as those statistical tests could yield a selection bias.
2.5 | rsfMRI data analysis
2.5.1 | Volumetric rsfMRI preprocessing
Volumetric rsfMRI data were preprocessed in a subject- 
native space 
using a modified version of a shell script generated by afni_proc.py 
(http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/afni_proc.
py.html) from AFNI [RRID:SCR_005927; Cox, 1996). Each subject’s 
whole- 
brain structural images were first skull stripped and registered 
(affine transform with 12 parameters) to the initial frame of the first 
rsfMRI run. For each rsfMRI run, the initial four frames were discarded 
to allow T1 magnetization saturation. Standard preprocessing methods 
were then applied, including despiking, slice timing correction, mo-
tion correction, spatial resampling (4 mm isotropic), normalization to 
whole- 
brain mode of 1000, band- 
pass filtering (0.009 < f < 0.08 Hz), 
and linear regression. At the motion correction stage, the six rigid 
body motion profiles were obtained for the linear regression. In the 
linear regression, the rsfMRI time series were third- 
order detrended, 
and several sources of signal fluctuation unlikely to be of neuronal 
origin were regressed out as nuisance variables: (1) six parameters 
for rigid body head motion acquired from the motion correction 
(Johnstone et al., 2006), (2) the signal averaged over the lateral ventri-
cles (Fox et al., 2005), (3) the signal averaged over a region centered 
in the deep cerebral white matter (Fox et al., 2005), and (4) the first 
temporal derivatives of the aforementioned parameters. After the lin-
ear regression, motion ‘scrubbing’ (Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, 
& Petersen, 2012) was performed with a frame- 
wise displacement 
(FD) of 0.5 mm and a standardized DVARS (http://www2.warwick.
ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/nichols/scripts/
fsl/DVARS.sh) of 1.8 to prevent potential motion artifacts (van Dijk, 
Sabuncu, & Buckner, 2012; Power et al., 2012; Satterthwaite et al., 
2012). A standardized DVARS of 1.8 corresponds to the median plus 
1.5 times interquartile range of the standardized DVARS data across 
all frames and runs. For participants on whom two runs of rsfMRI 
scans were acquired, the two preprocessed rsfMRI runs were tem-
porally concatenated. To account for the differences in total number 
of frames (subsequently different degrees of freedom for correlation 
coefficients) after motion scrubbing across rsfMRI scans, all remain-
ing frames were trimmed to the minimum length (121 frames; 242 s) 
across all rsfMRI scans as suggested in Power et al. (2014).
2.5.2 | Surface mapping
We used SUMA (Saad, Reynolds, Argall, Japee, & Cox, 2004) for sur-
face mapping and surface standardization. The preprocessed volu-
metric functional time series were projected onto mesh surfaces of 
each subject by averaging the time series across the voxels belonging 
to five equally spaced coordinates along the line between two match-
ing nodes of 1 mm inside of the white surface and the outside of the

pial surface. In the same way, the voxel- 
based subject masks were 
converted into surface- 
based subject masks. For group analysis, we 
standardized surface meshes (36,002 nodes per hemisphere with a 
2- 
mm spatial resolution) of each individual. We also obtained an inter-
section mask for the mesh nodes in which fMRI signals existed across 
all subjects and time points.
2.5.3 | Network- 
based statistics of longitudinal 
rsfMRI data
We obtained a connectivity matrix for each of the scans by calculating 
the Pearson correlation coefficients for average time series from each 
of the ROIs where statistically significant between- 
group differences in 
overall temporal changes in cortical thickness occurred. After perform-
ing a Fisher’s Z- 
transform to ensure the normality of correlations and 
scaling to Z- 
scores (i.e., zero mean and unit variance), we performed 
the LME analysis with the same model used for the cortical thickness 
analysis, additionally including between- and within- 
subject FD covari-
ates. The FD covariates were included because the LME analysis on (1) 
the percentage of motion censored volumes and (2) FD after censor-
ing and trimming revealed statistically significant changes in FD from 
TP2 to TP3 and from TP1 to TP3 (nonmonotonic) within SMART (Table 
S1). Statistically significant changes in connectivity were identified at 
|Z| > 1.96 (p < .05 at the connection level) with correction for multiple 
comparisons at p < .05 using network- 
based statistics (NBS; Zalesky, 
Fornito, & Bullmore, 2010). Note that we modified the original NBS 
MATLAB script (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/comparison/
nbs) for our LME analysis as the original script was written for the T- 
test. Although the original NBS utilizes permutation tests to estimate 
the null distribution of maximal component size, the permutation tests 
are invalid in longitudinal data, as the exchangeability assumption does 
not hold for such data. Thus, we performed a parametric bootstrap-
ping method by generating a bootstrapped sample from the estimated 
covariance matrix and subsequently performing LME analysis on the 
bootstrapped sample (Joo, Hormozdiari, Han, & Eskin, 2016). Ten 
thousand instances of bootstrapped samples were generated to esti-
mate the null distribution of maximal component size for each of the 
contrasts. NBS- 
corrected changes in connectivity were visualized on 
anatomical space using BrainNet Viewer (Xia, Wang, & He, 2013).
2.5.4 | Analysis of connectivity patterns according to 
large- 
scale networks
To further understand training- 
induced functional connectivity among 
the specified ROIs from the perspective of large- 
scale networks, we 
first determined which were the most affiliated resting- 
state networks 
to the ROIs. We used the seven network version of the resting- 
state 
cortical parcellation (Yeo et al., 2011), which is a large- 
scale network- 
based atlas of the cerebral cortex. The seven large- 
scale networks 
from the Yeo atlas include the visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention, 
salience (or ventral attention), limbic, frontoparietal, and default net-
works. All of these networks are frequently reported in the rsFC lit-
erature. We overlaid the ROIs obtained from group comparisons of 
training- 
induced changes in cortical thickness over time onto the Yeo 
atlas to identify which ROI affiliates with which large- 
scale network. 
We then identified the number of connections with statistically sig-
nificant group contrasts according to connectivity within and between 
the resting- 
state networks that each of the ROIs was affiliated with. 
We also assessed Euclidean distance of these connections according 
to connectivity within and between the resting- 
state networks that 
each of the ROIs was affiliated with.
2.6 | Analysis of effect sizes
As there are no standard effect size statistics for the LME model, we 
obtained the sizes of training- 
related effects within the SMART group 
in the following way. For neuropsychological tests that showed sta-
tistically significant between- 
group contrasts for temporal changes in 
scores, we identified average scaled scores for the SMART group at 
TP1 and TP3, and corresponding percentile ranks. For cortical thick-
ness estimates, we first calculated the amount of change in average 
cortical thickness over time within each of the regions that showed a 
statistically significant between- 
group contrast for temporal changes 
in cortical thickness. For each region, we then normalized the over-
all changes by average baseline cortical thickness within the SMART 
and BHW groups, respectively. Similarly, we calculated the amount of 
change in rsFC over time within each of the connections that showed 
statistically significant between- 
group contrasts for temporal changes 
in connectivity strength. For each of the connections, we then nor-
malized the amount of change by average connectivity strength for 
the corresponding connection within the SMART group. Note that we 
obtained effect sizes of these measures after adjusting for the covari-
ates that were included in the LME analyses (e.g., the BDI covariates).
2.7 | Quality assurance
We visually inspected all structural MRI scans to ensure that sub-
jects had no significant brain atrophy. In rsfMRI preprocessing, the 
quality of the preprocessed data was visually inspected at each step. 
After motion ‘scrubbing’, we confirmed that the total time of remain-
ing frames after the ‘scrubbing’ exceeded 4 min, the minimum length 
required to reliably estimate rsFC (van Dijk et al., 2010). We also en-
sured that there were no MRI scans or neuropsychological measures 
that were acquired too late (i.e., outside the 2 SD band from the mean) 
for all time points. Lastly, we excluded MRI scans from the LME analy-
sis when corresponding BDI scores were not available. See Table 2 for 
the number of MRI scans after the QA procedure.
2.8 | Brain and behavior relationship
2.8.1 | Cortical thickness versus neuropsychological 
performance
To confirm whether improved neuropsychological performance 
after training was related to changes in cortical thickness, we per-
formed the LME analysis with a modified model by additionally 
 8 of 27  |    
HAN et Al.
including within- and between- 
subject factors from the number–
letter switching versus motor speed scores of the trail- 
making test 
from the D- 
KEFS. We chose the trail- 
making test scores because 
the SMART group showed statistically significant (p < .05) improve-
ment on this test relative to the controls (see the results section). 
We adjusted for age, years of education, estimated current IQ, and 
BDI scores before we included the covariates to minimize poten-
tial effects of these measures on the trail- 
making test scores. As 
we were interested in how and where training- 
induced changes in 
cortical thickness were associated with improved neuropsychologi-
cal performance within subjects, we focused on assessing the within- 
subject covariate for the trail- 
making test in the revised LME model. 
As temporal patterns of cortical thickness change within the SMART 
group were often nonmonotonic (i.e., returning to the baseline at 
TP3; see the results section), we also assessed associations between 
nonmonotonic changes in cortical thickness and improvement in the 
trail- 
making test scores. Specifically, we performed the LME analy-
sis on nonmonotonic components of cortical thickness by reflecting 
cortical thickness at TP3 over the axis of cortical thickness at TP2 
(see Figure S2 for more details). This made the reflected thickness 
at TP3 artificially made overall changes appear monotonic when ac-
tual temporal pattern of changes was nonmonotonic. As with the 
cortical thickness analysis, we identified statistically significant as-
sociations between changes in the two measures at  
pvertex < .05 and 
pcluster < .05.
2.8.2 | Resting- 
state functional connectivity versus 
neuropsychological performance
We also performed the LME analysis on seed- 
based connectivity 
additionally including within- 
 and between- 
subject covariates from 
the number–letter switching versus motor speed scores of the trail- 
making test from the D- 
KEFS in the model. We defined seeds as the 
regions that showed statistically significant associations between 
changes in cortical thickness and improvement in trail- 
making scores 
(refer to the result sections). The LME analysis was then performed for 
each of the seeds. We identified statistically significant associations 
between changes in the two measures at pvertex < .05 and pcluster < .005 
(=.05/10) by additionally correcting for the number of seeds.
2.9 | Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted in MATLAB R2013a. First, we 
performed the Shapiro–Wilk test at α = 0.05 to assess the normality 
of distributions of each group’s demographics (age, years of education, 
and postinjury time). Age, years of education, and postinjury time did 
not pass the Shapiro–Wilk normality test. Thus, the Mann–Whitney 
U- 
test was used to compare these demographics between the groups. 
The Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the gender distributions 
and proportion of civilians and veterans between the groups. The like-
lihood ratio chi- 
square test was used to compare the distribution of 
estimated initial injury severity and primary cause of injury between 
the groups, respectively. We performed T- 
tests to compare current 
and premorbid IQs between the groups. Similar to analyses of corti-
cal thickness and rsFC, we performed the LME analysis on the other 
neuropsychological measures using a piece- 
wise linear model with a 
breakpoint at TP2, and a randomly varying intercept. In these analy-
ses, we included years of education, estimated current IQ, and BDI 
covariates for age- 
adjusted scores of color–word test, verbal fluency 
test, card sorting test, and trail- 
making test. The age, years of educa-
tion, and estimated current IQ covariates were not included for BDI, 
PCL- 
S, and satisfaction with life scale as we did not predict effects of 
age and years of education on these measures. Indeed, we confirmed 
that there were no statistically significant effects of age and years of 
education on these measures. However, the BDI covariate was in-
cluded for satisfaction with life scale. Note that this portion of the 
study was carried out as an exploratory analysis to identify candidate 
neuropsychological measures that may characterize the relationship 
between the brain and behavior in the context of cognitive training 
after TBI. As such, we did not correct for multiple comparisons across 
the neuropsychological measures. Our previous study (Vas et al., 
2016) reported the efficacy of the SMART for chronic TBI based on 
neuropsychological assessment with larger sample sizes, which was 
the primary focus of that prior study.

3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Demographics
All participants were at a long- 
term chronic phase of TBI (approxi-
mately 8 years postinjury time on average). There were no statisti-
cally significant group differences in age, estimated current and 
premorbid IQs, gender, proportions of civilians and veterans, postin-
jury time, distribution of estimated initial injury severity, or distribu-
tion of primary injury types at α = 0.05 (Table 1). However, group 
differences in years of education and estimated current IQ were 
 
marginally significant.
3.2 | Neuropsychological measures
The average times of assessments were 9 and 18 weeks from the 
baseline, respectively (Table 2). Although we attempted to match in-
jury characteristics and other demographics between the two train-
ing groups by randomized group assignment, statistically significant 
(p < .05) group differences were observed in performance at baseline 
in test scores from the D- 
KEFS (Table 3). These differences occurred 
as follows: inhibition and inhibition/switching scores of the color–
word test; free sorting, confirmed correct sorts, sort recognition, de-
scription, and combined description scores of the card sorting test; 
and visual scanning, number sequencing, motor speed scores of the 
trail- 
making test (see the limitation section for relevant limitations 
of this study). We focused on reporting between- 
group differences 
in training- 
induced changes in neuropsychological measures (con-
ceptually same as group- 
by- 
time interactions in repeated- 
measures 
ANOVA).
In this exploratory analysis, between- 
group differences in 
changes in neuropsychological measures over multiple time points 
occurred in number–letter switching versus motor speed scores of 
the trail- 
making test from the D- 
KEFS (p = .01; Table 3). Within- 
group 
contrast results (Table 4) revealed that monotonic improvements in 
number–letter switching versus motor speed scores of the trail- 
making test scores for the SMART led to the observed group contrast 
difference.
There were marginal (p < .1) group differences in training- 
induced 
temporal change in the word- 
reading scores of the color–word test 
from the D- 
KEFS and number–letter switching scores of the trail- 
making test from the D- 
KEFS. Marginal results may be explained by a 
small sample size relative to individual variability in the neuropsycho-
logical measures. These marginal results should be interpreted with 
caution as these were not statistically significant at α = 0.05.
3.3 | Cortical thickness analysis results
The QA procedure allowed us to include 148 structural MRI scans 
from 58 participants (N = 30 for SMART and 28 for BHW) in the corti-
cal thickness analysis (Table 2). The average timing of MRI scans that 
passed the quality assurance procedures were 9 and 21 weeks from 
the baseline, respectively (Table 2).
3.3.1 | Whole- 
brain, group analysis results
The whole- 
brain, LME analysis demonstrated temporal changes 
in cortical thickness for the training groups over three time points 
(Figure 2). Overall, the patterns of group differences in monotonic 
and nonmonotonic temporal changes in cortical thickness were 
 
distributed over the whole brain. Specifically, statistically significant 
(pvertex < .05,  
pcluster < .05) group differences in nonmonotonic (in-
creases followed by decreases back to the baseline) cortical thick-
ness changes over time were observed in the bilateral dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior medial prefrontal cortex 
(AMPFC); left subcentral gyrus (L SCG); and right dorsal prefrontal 
cortex (R DPFC). Within- 
group contrast maps, corrected for multi-
ple comparisons (Figure 2a), revealed that the statistically significant 
group differences were attributable to (1) increases followed by de-
creases in cortical thickness of the SMART group in the L DLPFC 
and R AMPFC, and (2) decreases followed by increases in cortical 
thickness of the BHW group in the L SCG and L AMPFC. (Figures 2a 
and S3a). In the R DLPFC and R DPFC, further assessment of within- 
group contrast map at pvertex < .05 (Figure S3a) revealed that the sta-
tistically significant group differences were attributable to increases 
followed by decreases in cortical thickness of the SMART group. We 
also observed statistically significant group differences in monotonic 
temporal changes in the left precentral gyrus (L PRCG) and left lingual 
gyrus (LG), right postcentral gyrus (R POCG), right middle temporal 
complex (R MT+), right anterior prefrontal cortex (R APFC), and right 
occipitoparietal lobe (R OCPL). Within- 
group contrast maps, cor-
rected for multiple comparisons (Figure 2b), revealed that monotonic 
increases in cortical thickness of the SMART group in the R POCG 
and R OCPL led to the group differences observed in these regions. 
In R MT+ and R APFC, monotonic decreases in cortical thickness of 
the SMART group led to the observed group differences. Within- 
group contrast maps, uncorrected for multiple comparisons, further 
identified that statistically significant group contrasts were driven by 
(1) a combination of monotonic decreases in cortical thickness for the 
SMART group and monotonic increases in the BHW group in the L 
PRCG and (2) monotonic increases in the BHW group in the L LG 
(Figure S3b). The colormaps for within- and between- 
group contrasts 
for two time points (i.e., TP1 to TP2 and TP2 to TP3) further supported 
the observed cortical thickness changes over all three time points 
(Figure 3).
3.3.2 | Post hoc ROI analysis results
The group analysis results yielded 12 ROIs (Figure 2, Table 5). We fur-
ther identified individual patterns of cortical thickness changes within 
these ROIs. Overall, patterns of changes in cortical thickness at the 
single- 
subject level were consistent with the observed patterns at the 
group level, confirming that observed patterns at the group level were 
not due to outliers (Figures 4 and S4). For example, cortical thick-
ness in the R DPFC of the SMART participants was increased then 
decreased back to the baseline, whereas temporal changes in cortical 
thickness of the BHW participants in this region were stable over time 
 10 of 27  |    
HAN et Al.
(Figure 4a). More specifically, from TP1 to TP2 six SMART participants 
showed changes in cortical thickness in R DPFC that exceeded the 2 
SD band from the BHW group in this region. From TP2 to TP3 two of 
these six SMART participants exceeded the 2 SD band from the BHW 
group in this region. Across the three time points, four of these six 
SMART participants showed nonmonotonic changes in cortical thick-
ness greater than the 2 SD band from the BHW group. Note that one 
of these six SMART participants did not undergo an MRI scan at TP3. 
None of the participants would be expected to be outside of the 2 
SD range (5%) if these changes occurred by chance. The ROI analysis 
also demonstrated large individual variability and a small magnitude 
(<0.5 mm) of training- 
related changes in cortical thickness across the 
12 ROIs overall.
Slice views of the ROIs of the participants with the greatest 
amount of overall changes in cortical thickness in their respective ROIs 
(Figures 5 and S5) exhibited more detailed patterns of training- 
related 
changes in cortical thickness. For these subjects, pial surface changes 
at sulcal banks primarily led to temporal changes in cortical thickness 
in most of the ROIs. One exception occurred in three participants’ L 
POCG and L PRCG where the gray/white surface of the gyral blade 
induced temporal changes in cortical thickness (Figures 5b, S5e and 
S5f).
3.4 | rsfMRI analysis results
The QA procedure (i.e., motion scrubbing, timing of scans, and the 
presence of corresponding BDI- 
II scores) allowed us to include 
128 rsfMRI scans from 57 participants (N = 29 for SMART and 28 
for BHW) in the rsfMRI analysis (Tables 2 and S1). At TP1, there 
were no statistically significant group differences in rsFC, which al-
lowed us to compare group differences in rsFC at later time points 
(Figure 6a,b). No statistically significant changes occurred within the

BHW group, either. The SMART group showed statistically signifi-
cant (pNBS = 0.0001) monotonic increases from TP1 to TP3 over the 
BHW group (Figure 6c,d). Overall increases in connectivity of SMART 
relative to BHW primarily occurred at connections with R DPFC and 
R APFC, and long- 
range connections (i.e., connections that are long 
enough to encompass different brain regions, lobes, or hemispheres). 
The training- 
related monotonic increases in rsFC of the SMART group 
yielded greater connectivity strength of the SMART than the BHW 
at TP3 (pNBS = 0.0004). The map for the ROIs overlaid onto the Yeo 
atlas (Yeo et al., 2011) revealed that the ROIs were affiliated with the 
default- 
mode network (DMN) (Greicius, Krasnow, Reiss, & Menon, 
2002; Raichle et al., 2001), somatomotor network (SMN) (Smith et al., 
2009), and visual network (VN) (Lowe, Mock, & Sorenson, 1998) 
(Figure S6). The subsequent large- 
scale network- 
based assessment 
of connectivity increases over time for the SMART group relative to 
the BHW group exhibited that increases in connectivity primarily oc-
curred between the DMN and SMN, and between the DMN and VN 
(Figure 7a). Connection distance of such between- 
network connec-
tivity was long (>70 mm; Figure 7b), encompassing different lobes of 
the brain.
3.5 | The sizes of training- 
related effects
The SMART- 
induced changes in scaled scores for the trail- 
making 
number–letter switching versus motor speed from 8.2 at TP1 to 9.8 
at TP3 on average. These scaled scores at TP1 and TP3 correspond 
to 25% and 50% in percentile ranks, respectively. This indicates that 
the SMART group participants showed average performance on the 
trail- 
making test compared to normative samples. SMART induced 
0.04–0.13 mm of cortical thickness changes within the regions that 
showed statistically significant between- 
group contrasts (Table 5). 
These change ranges correspond to 1.8~5.2% change compared to 
baseline thickness. SMART also yielded training- 
induced changes in 
rsFC, ranging from 1.0 to 2.8 in Z- 
scores and from 29.1 to 172.6% 
(Figure 8).
3.6 | Training- 
induced changes in the brain versus 
improvement in neuropsychological performance
We observed statistically significant (pvertex < .05, pcluster < .05) asso-
ciations between training- 
induced changes in cortical thickness and 
improvements in neuropsychological performance after the SMART 
(Figure 9a, Table 6). These associations occurred with both mono-
tonic and nonmonotonic changes in cortical thickness after SMART. 
Statistically significant associations between changes in these two 
measures did not occur with the controls. Note that the SMART 
group showed statistically significant (p < .05) monotonic improve-
ment in scores on the trail- 
making number–letter switching versus 
motor speed, whereas the control group showed trends in reduced 
scores over time. Thus, positive association in the given region shown 
in Figure 9a indicates that the participants with the improved trail- 
making scores after the SMART showed monotonic increases or in-
creases then decreases in cortical thickness in that region. Negative 
association indicates that improvement in the test scores was associ-
ated with monotonic decreases or decreases followed by increases 
in cortical thickness in the given region within the SMART group. 
Trajectories of cortical thickness and the trail- 
making test scores over 
time (Figure 9b–c) confirmed the observed group analysis results.
Analyses of rsFC with seeds identified from the results of the cor-
tical thickness analysis from SMART exhibited the patterns of connec-
tivity that were associated with the improved trail- 
making test scores 
(pvertex < .05, pcluster < .005; Figure 10). Within the SMART group, 
positive associations between the two measures indicate that partic-
ipants with training- 
induced improvement in the trail- 
making scores 
showed monotonically increased rsFC between the given seed and re-
gion. Note that most of the temporal patterns of associated functional

connectivity were monotonic increases. These patterns of associations 
even occurred in seed regions where changes in cortical thickness 
were nonmonotonic (e.g., the right lateral occipital lobe seed).
4 | DISCUSSION
We demonstrated changes in cortical thickness and resting- 
state 
connectivity of individuals at chronic stage of TBI following strategy- 
based reasoning training. To our knowledge, this is the first MRI- 
based study to report brain plasticity as measured by both cortical 
thickness and rsFC in chronic TBI following cognitive training. Novel 
methods employed in this study included comparing individuals un-
dergoing strategy- 
based training with an active control condition 
matching on all factors except training content. We assessed group- 
by- 
time interaction effects, considered to be the gold standard evi-
dence for training- 
related neuronal and behavioral changes (Thomas 
& Baker, 2013). Furthermore, we employed an LME analysis to ac-
count for nonuniform data acquisition timing across the participants 
and participant dropouts, which frequently occurs in longitudinal 
studies.
4.1 | Changes in cortical thickness following training
Our cortical thickness findings supported our hypothesis that train-
ing could induce changes in brain morphometry of individuals even 
at the chronic stage of TBI. These findings extend a line of research 
in structural brain plasticity in clinical populations (Alosco et al., 
2015; McEwen et al., 2015; Reiter et al., 2015; Sehm et al., 2014) 
by demonstrating training- 
induced changes in cortical thickness in 
the context of cognitive training after TBI. Another novel component 
of our study is that we demonstrated structural plasticity following 
cognitive reasoning training, adding to similar evidence following 
physical activity (Alosco et al., 2015; McEwen et al., 2015; Reiter 
et al., 2015) and balance training (Sehm et al., 2014). Cognitive train-
ing regimes for TBI are frequently necessary to help individuals re-
gain daily life functions, as individuals with chronic TBI often have 
persistent difficulties in the higher- 
order cognitive domains, such as 
abstract reasoning, planning, decision making, and executive func-
tion. The efficacy of reasoning training in chronic TBI translated into 
improvement in trail- 
making test scores that reflect improvement in 
executive function (Table 3). Note that executive function is the most 
frequently impaired domain in TBI. Previous morphometry studies

reported altered cortical volume and thickness following TBI. Our 
findings extend this body of TBI literature to show that cortical thick-
ness may be modified by training protocols several years after injury. 
Thus, even though a TBI alters morphometry of the gray matter, the 
injured brain at the chronic stage of TBI responds to cognitive train-
ing by exhibiting dynamic changes in cortical thickness (Figures 2–5 
and 9). The need for effective rehabilitative trainings for individuals 
with chronic TBI is growing (Frieden et al., 2015). In this context, our 
findings on changes in cortical thickness following strategy- 
based 
reasoning training for individuals with TBI suggest that cortical thick-
ness may be a sensitive measure to identify training- 
induced neuro-
plasticity in TBI. However, measuring cortical thickness alone may 
not be sufficient to evaluate the efficacy of neurorehabilitation for 
TBI as half of the changes in cortical thickness over time within the 
SMART group were transient and the controls also showed changes 
in cortical thickness (Table 5).
The spatial patterns of training- 
related changes in cortical 
thickness were specific to the type of training that was carried out 
(Figures 2–5 and S3–S5, Table 5). As such, regions with statistically 
significant (pvertex < .05, pcluster < .05) changes in cortical thickness 
of the SMART and BHW groups did not overlap (Figures 2–3 and 
S3). Among the 12 regions identified in the group analysis, statis-
tically significant between- 
group differences in changes in cortical 
thickness occurred by within- 
group changes that occurred in 10 
regions in the SMART group compared to 4  
regions in the BHW 
group (Figures 2–3 and S2, Table 5). SMART training is targeted 
at improving higher- 
order cognition (i.e., executive functions), and 
is likely to involve different cognitive processes than the BHW. 
SMART involves strategic attention, abstract reasoning, and cogni-
tive flexibility (Vas et al., 2016), whereas the BHW primarily involves 
learning and memory. A previous study carried out in healthy indi-
viduals (Metzler- 
Baddeley et al., 2016) reported that changes in cor-
tical thickness occurred in three regions after highly taxing working 
memory training compared to change in one region after less- 
taxing 
working memory training. Taken together, a greater number of re-
gions exhibited cortical thickness changes over time after SMART 
training compared to the BHW group, suggesting that strategy- 
based reasoning training programs may induce more spatially ex-
tensive gray matter structural changes than simply engaging in new 
learning. Temporal patterns of cortical thickness changes were also 
training specific. However, half of the changes in cortical thickness 
over time within the SMART group were transient (Table 5) mak-
ing it difficult to infer training- 
induced neuroplasticity from corti-
cal thickness results alone. In other words, this demonstrates the 
necessity and advantage of utilizing multimodal imaging methods 
to better understand training- 
induced neuroplasticity in chronic TBI 
(see discussion on changes in cortical thickness and resting- 
state 
connectivity).

Interestingly, the majority of the training- 
induced changes 
in cortical thickness occurred within the sulcal span at sulcal 
banks (Figures 5 and S5). More specifically, increases in cortical 
 
thickness were accompanied by decreases in sulcal span, and de-
creases in cortical thickness were accompanied by increases in 
sulcal span. Although this phenomenon has not previously been 
documented in studies of training- 
related brain plasticity, our 
finding is in line with previous reports on inverse relationships be-
tween  
cortical thickness and sulcal span in adolescence (Aleman- 
Gomez et al., 2013) and aging populations (Kochunov et al., 2008). 
However, it remains unclear whether the phenomenon observed 
in a subset of participants (Figure 5) occurred in the other par-
ticipants. Thus, further studies will be required to quantitatively 
assess sulcal span and potentially other morphometric measures 
at the group level.
Within the SMART group, temporal patterns of changes in cortical 
thickness varied among brain regions (Figures 2–5 and S3–S5, Table 5). 
We observed (1) nonmonotonic changes in the bilateral DLPFC, L SCG, 
R DPFC, and R AMPFC, (2) monotonic increases in the R POCG and 
R OCPL, and (3) monotonic decreases in the L PRCG, R MT+, and 
R APFC. Although the majority of the previous studies reported in-
creases in cortical thickness or gray matter volume (Valkanova, Eguia 
Rodriguez, & Ebmeier, 2014), differences in directionality of cortical 
thickness and cortical volume changes across brain regions were also 
reported in several previous studies (Draganski et al., 2006; Maguire 
et al., 2000; Metzler- 
Baddeley et al., 2016; Taubert et al., 2010). These

diverse temporal trajectories of cortical thickness in both present and 
in previous studies demonstrate the complexity of brain plasticity. 
Further studies are required, but these different cortical thickness 
dynamics across brain regions may be attributable to different bio-
logical mechanisms and time scales of brain plasticity across the dif-
ferent brain regions. This may also reflect different patterns of brain 
response to subcomponents of the SMART occurring over the 8- 
week 
timeframe of the training.
4.2 | Changes in resting- 
state functional connectivity 
following training
TBI- 
related deficits in rsFC can be caused by DAI (Smith et al., 2003). 
This is one of the most common mechanisms of a closed head injury 
and is well documented in the TBI literature (Sharp et al., 2014), yet 
training- 
related changes in rsFC of individuals with TBI are still poorly 
characterized. In this regard, our rsFC findings (Figures 6–8 and 10) 
extend the TBI literature with results that demonstrate the utility 
of neuroimaging not only for diagnosing TBI but also for identifying 
brain changes associated with cognitive training for individuals with 
TBI. Furthermore, results for rsFC portion of our study (Figure 6) are 
consistent with two theories of rsFC. First, rsFC is based upon the un-
derlying structural connectivity, and therefore reflects the functional 
anatomy of brain systems (Damoiseaux et al., 2006). On the other 
hand, rsFC is also sculpted by the repeated history of coordinated 
activation between brain regions during experience- 
driven activi-
ties (Lewis et al., 2009). Our rsFC findings (Figure 6) further support 
the latter aspect of rsFC by demonstrating training- 
related changes 
in rsFC of injured brain. Note that our findings do not contradict the 
former aspect of rsFC (i.e., the patterns of rsFC follow functional

organization) because overall patterns of rsFC following SMART are 
preserved over time. In other words, SMART strengthened existent 
rsFC, not inducing radically different functional organization relative 
to the time period prior to training. For example, the SMART group re-
tained a tight coupling among bilateral AMPFC, R DPFC, and R APFC 
as a part of the DMN (Greicius et al., 2002; Raichle et al., 2001) and 
showed relatively strong sustained connectivity (1) between L DLPFC 
and R DLPFC and (2) among R MT+, L LG, and R OCPL (Yeo et al., 
2011).
Monotonic increases in rsFC for the SMART group primarily oc-
curred at between- 
network and long- 
range connections (Figure 7). 
Although there are a variety of differences among training regimes, 
the prominent changes we observed in between- 
network connectiv-
ity over within- 
network connectivity following training are consistent 
with the findings of Lewis et al. (2009). R DFPC and R APFC were 
the most heavily involved in connectivity changes for the SMART 
group. The ROIs overlaid onto the Yeo atlas revealed that the ROIs 
were affiliated with the default mode, somatomotor, visual networks 
(Figure S5). From the perspective of large- 
scale networks, increases 
in connectivity between the DMN and SMN (seven connections) 
and between the DMN and VN (three connections) were prominent 
(Figure 7a). We would have missed the patterns of such changes in 
rsFC following the strategy-based reasoning training (i.e., SMART) if 
we had limited our assessment of connectivity to within individual net-
works. Thus, we suggest one should take a comprehensive approach 
to identify patterns of training- 
related changes in rsFC when the train-
ing involves top- 
down integrative reasoning processes. Interestingly, 
between- 
network connectivity that showed training- 
related changes 
over time corresponded to long- 
range connections (Figure 7b). Long- 
range connections are fewer in number, but are important for efficient 
global neural communications (Achard, Salvador, Whitcher, Suckling, 
& Bullmore, 2006). The strength of brain activity in regions with high 
between- 
network connectivity is proportional to the number of cog-
nitive functions engaged in a task (Bertolero, Yeo, & D’Esposito, 2015). 
Furthermore, damage to these regions disrupts the brain’s modular or-
ganization (Gratton, Nomura, Pérez, & D’Esposito, 2012) and yields 
widespread deficits in neuropsychological measures (Warren et al., 
2014). Critically, long- 
range and between- 
network connections are 
also vulnerable to damage from TBI (Han et al., 2014, 2016). Although 
further graph- 
theoretic studies comprehensively assessing brain net-
works of our participants are needed (e.g., studies evaluating greater 
numbers of nodes), the present training- 
related changes which showed 
a preferential impact to long- 
range and between- 
network connectiv-
ity suggest that the SMART program might contribute to more effi-
cient neural communications thus perhaps healthier brain systems.
4.3 | Changes in cortical thickness and resting- 
state 
connectivity
Changes in rsFC among the regions which also exhibited temporal 
changes in cortical thickness (Figure 6) indicate that training- 
induced 
spatially distributed changes in cortical thickness accompany changes 
in the functional architecture of the brain. Although several studies 
have reported changes in rsFC in a variety of domains (see Guerra- 
Carrillo et al., 2014 and Kelly & Castellanos, 2014 for review), very 
few studies (Takeuchi et al., 2014; Taubert et al., 2011) simultane-
ously investigated changes in gray matter morphometry and rsFC. 
These previous multimodal imaging studies (Takeuchi et al., 2014; 
Taubert et al., 2011) separately investigated changes in rsFC and gray 
matter structure at the whole- 
brain level. However, we directly exam-
ined whether training- 
related changes in cortical thickness co- 
occur 
with connectivity changes or these cortical thickness changes remain 
spatially isolated. This was achieved by constraining regions of assess-
ment for rsFC into connections among regions showing changes in 
cortical thickness.
Although co- 
occurring patterns of cortical thickness and rsFC were 
identified, the specific dynamics of rsFC and morphometric change 
varied. Unlike the diverse temporal patterns of changes in cortical 
thickness of the SMART group (i.e., increases followed by decreases, 
monotonic increases, or monotonic decreases), the SMART group 
showed only monotonic increases in rsFC. For example, R DPFC and 
R APFC, which were heavily associated with increases in rsFC of the 
SMART group, showed transient changes in cortical thickness. These 
apparently unintuitive phenomena may be explained by the principle

of energy conservation in the brain (Laughlin & Sejnowsk, 2003). As 
such, diverse and complex changes in cortical thickness following 
training may reflect adaptive and dynamic processes of reallocating 
neural resources to support more ‘successful’ information processing 
relevant to the training program, while maintaining energy efficiency 
of the brain. In this context, training- 
induced increases in rsFC (par-
ticularly, long- 
range and between- 
network connections) might reflect 
more ‘successful’ information processing compared to the pretraining 
stage. Results of brain and behavior relationships indirectly support 
this hypothesis. As such, improvement in neuropsychological perfor-
mance after the SMART was associated with monotonic increases in 
rsFC in most of the seeds and regions while the patterns of associa-
tions with cortical thickness included a mixture of monotonic and non-
monotonic changes (Figures 9 and 10). Future studies will be needed 
to directly measure the energy efficiency of the brain.
4.4 | Potential underlying mechanisms
The underlying microscopic- 
level mechanisms of the training- 
related 
changes in cortical thickness and rsFC are unknown, which is common 
in most of the MRI studies. However, we can speculate potential un-
derlying mechanisms based on the literature. As in the case of learning 
and memory (Chklovskii, Mel, & Svoboda, 2004), functional plasticity 
(i.e., changes in synaptic strength without changing anatomical con-
nectivity between neurons) alone may be insufficient to explain the 
underlying biological mechanisms of our findings because structural 
plasticity (i.e., changes in anatomical connectivity between neurons) 
is likely to be involved in the observed, training- 
induced changes in 
cortical thickness. Neurogenesis may not be one of the underlying 
mechanisms, as neurogenesis outside the hippocampus in human ap-
pears unlikely (Zatorre, Fields, & Johansen- 
Berg, 2012).
Rather, the primary underlying mechanisms may be synaptic plas-
ticity (i.e., structural changes in synapses), which has been reviewed 
elsewhere (Butz, Wörgötter, & van Ooyen, 2009; May, 2011; Zatorre 
et al., 2012). More precisely, (1) synaptogensis by growing dendritic 
spines, increases in the number of synapses per neuron, dendritic ar-
borization, and axonal sprouting, (2) selective synaptic pruning, and 
(3) synaptic remodeling by dendritic rebranching and axonal rerouting 
may have led to the training- 
induced changes in both cortical thick-
ness and rsFC as we report herein. At present, it remains unclear which 
precise mechanism of synaptic plasticity plays a role at specific time 
phase. Several or all of these complex mechanisms may contribute 
to rewiring neural circuits for more efficient information processing, 
as indicated by increased rsFC following training. Second, changes 
in glial cells such as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia (re-
viewed in Markham & Greenough, 2005 and Zatorre et al., 2012) may 
also reflect training- 
induced changes in cortical thickness and rsFC. In 
particular, changes in oligodendrocytes, and subsequent myelination 
and myelin remodeling in the white matter are plausible candidate pro-
cesses, as axonal connections are pivotal in the establishment of rsFC 
(Zhou et al., 2014). Further neuroimaging studies assessing white mat-
ter microstructure such as diffusion tensor imaging and myelin water 
imaging (Alonso- 
Ortiz, Levesque, & Pike, 2015) may help to further 
clarify the validity of this hypothesis. Third, changes in the cerebrovas-
culature may be another mechanism. Experience- 
dependent changes 
in cerebrovasculature in rats have been reported (Black, Sirevaag, 
& Greenough, 1987; Sirevaag, Black, Shafron, & Greenough, 1988). 
Furthermore, Zatorre et al. (2012) suggested that changes in cere-
brovasculature are a potential candidate mechanisms for gray matter 
changes following training, and Tak, Wang, Polimeni, Yan, and Chen 
(2014) reported a close association between the cerebrovasculature 
and measures of rsFC. Importantly, changes in cerebral blood flow and 
rsFC of the adult human brain following cognitive training have been 
previously reported (Chapman et al., 2015; Takeuchi et al., 2013).
4.5 | Limitations and future directions
Our study sample was heterogeneous, which may not be scientifi-
cally ideal, particularly in the context of diagnosis and characterization 
of pathology. However, in practice, TBI is marked by heterogene-
ity. Training- 
related changes within our heterogeneous TBI sample 
demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the SMART program 
for individuals with chronic TBI. Thus, the heterogeneity of our TBI 
sample is advantageous in terms of relating to the clinical popula-
tion of interest. Although our TBI sample is inherently heterogene-
ous, we carefully randomized the two training groups making them 
demographically similar and we maintained training protocols consist-
ently across individuals within each of the training groups. Second, 
even though we matched demographics, injury characteristics (e.g., 
initial injury severity and postinjury time), and severity of subclinical 
psychiatric symptoms of the two groups by carefully randomizing 
the participants, there were group differences in scores on multiple 
neuropsychological test at the baseline. These baseline group differ-
ences yielded cross- 
sectional group comparisons at TP2 and TP3 less 
meaningful. Thus, we focused on reporting group contrasts in tem-
poral changes in neuropsychological measures (conceptually same as 
group- 
by- 
time interactions in ANOVA). The heterogeneity of neu-
ropsychological test performance in TBI (Tellier et al., 2009; Thaler 
et al., 2013) and other potential factors that we did not measure such 
as genetics (Diaz- 
Arrastia & Baxter, 2006) might have led such group 
differences at the baseline. Future research in identifying factors that 
are affecting neuropsychological test performance in chronic TBI may 
provide us with better strategy to randomize training group assign-
ment. Third, we did not systematically assess the effects of training on 
rsFC at the whole- 
brain level. As such, spatial and temporal patterns 
of rsFC following training outside the selected twelve regions, and 
training- 
related changes in network topology at the whole- 
brain level 
remain unknown. Thus, in the future, we will utilize a comprehensive 
graph- 
theoretic approach to address this concern. Fourth, it remains 
unclear whether the SMART program in individuals with chronic TBI 
led to recovery or compensation of altered neural circuitry that re-
sulted from TBIs. Although improvement in neuropsychological tests 
performance is observed, “true” recovery of neural circuitry of injured 
brain following training may be unlikely (Kolb & Muhammad, 2014). 
Future comparisons with healthy individuals may address this ques-
tion. Lastly, our study would provide better understanding of brain 
     |  23 of 27

and behavior relationships following rehabilitation for chronic TBI if 
we assessed more appropriate behavioral measures for improvement 
associated with the SMART program or if we adopted more refined 
and specialized training program. The SMART is an integrative train-
ing that aims to improve multiple domains of cognitive functions such 
as abstract reasoning, goal management, and selective attention (Vas 
et al., 2011). The number–letter switching versus motor speed of the 
trail- 
making test measures cognitive processing speed, working mem-
ory, and the ability to switch tasks while maintaining a goal (Sánchez- 
Cubillo et al., 2009). Although improvements in cognitive functions 
following the SMART for TBI can reflect improvement in the trail- 
making test scores, the trail- 
making test does not measure the same 
level of cognitive functions that the SMART improves. This may be the 
reason why spatial patterns of between- 
group contrasts for changes 
in cortical thickness (Figure 2) and statistically significant associations 
between changes in cortical thickness and the trail- 
making test within 
the SMART group (Figure 9) did not overlap. Future studies utilizing 
carefully designed fMRI tasks that can tease apart SMART- 
induced 
cognitive domains may allow us to better understand the brain–be-
havior relationships associated with the SMART for chronic TBI.
Our future directions include carrying out assessments of other 
morphometric measures and graph- 
theoretic measures in this TBI co-
hort to better understand the current findings, and further address the 
concerns discussed above. We also plan to investigate and identify 
pretraining conditions that are predictive of training- 
related changes 
in cortical thickness and rsFC of the individuals with TBI, and are 
linked to training outcomes (Arnemann et al., 2015; Ventura- 
Campos 
et al., 2013).
5 | CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we provided neural evidence of the effects of cogni-
tive rehabilitation in chronic TBI. Specifically, we demonstrated that 
strategy- 
based reasoning training led to dynamic changes in corti-
cal thickness and rsFC in individuals with chronic TBI relative to an 
information- 
based training comparison group, even 3 months after 
training was completed. Our findings suggest that brain plasticity con-
tinues through the chronic phases of TBI, and a combination of cortical 
thickness and rsFC may be sensitive biomarkers for evaluating the ef-
ficacy of cognitive rehabilitation in the chronic TBI populations.
