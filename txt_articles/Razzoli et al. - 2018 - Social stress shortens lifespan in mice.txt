Summary
Stress and low socioeconomic status in humans confer increased vulnerability to mor-
bidity and mortality. However, this association is not mechanistically understood nor
has its causation been explored in animal models thus far. Recently, cellular senes-
cence has been suggested as a potential mechanism linking lifelong stress to age-
related diseases and shorter life expectancy in humans. Here, we established a causal
role for lifelong social stress on shortening lifespan and increasing the risk of cardio-
vascular disease in mice. Specifically, we developed a lifelong chronic psychosocial
stress model in which male mouse aggressive behavior is used to study the impact of
negative social confrontations on healthspan and lifespan. C57BL/6J mice identified
through unbiased cluster analysis for receiving high while exhibiting low aggression, or
identified as subordinate based on an ethologic criterion, had lower median and maxi-
mal lifespan, and developed earlier onset of several organ pathologies in the presence
of a cellular senescence signature. Critically, subordinate mice developed spontaneous
early-stage atherosclerotic lesions of the aortic sinuses characterized by significant
immune cells infiltration and sporadic rupture and calcification, none of which was
found in dominant subjects. In conclusion, we present here the first rodent model to
study and mechanistically dissect the impact of chronic stress on lifespan and disease
of aging. These data highlight a conserved role for social stress and low social status
on shortening lifespan and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in mammals
and identify a potential mechanistic link for this complex phenomenon.

INTRODUCTION
Classical clinical and epidemiological studies unequivocally demon-
strate that stress, allostatic load, low socioeconomic status (SES), and
low social rank confer increased vulnerability to morbidity signifi-
cantly shortening lifespan in humans (Chetty et al., 2016; Marmot
et al., 1991; Seeman, Singer, Rowe, Horwitz & McEwen, 1997;
Stringhini et al., 2012). Notably, a recent multicohort study of 1.7
million adults followed up for mortality (Stringhini et al., 2017) has
recognized the effect of SES among other recognized WHO risk

 factors (i.e., smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, alcohol intake)
assigning it a notable 1.26 hazard ratio. Similarly, an association
has been demonstrated between psychological stress, senescence
as measured by telomere shortening, and increased mortality (Epel
& Lithgow, 2014; Epel et al., 2004). Altogether, these evidences
support the inclusion of failed “adaptation to stress,” as one of
the so-called Seven Pillars of Aging (Kennedy et al., 2014). Similar
to human condition, low social rank and sustained lifetime stress
significantly worsen healthspan and increase mortality rate in non-
human primates (Maestripieri & Hoffman, 2011; Sapolsky, 2005;
Tung,
Archie,
Altmann
&
Alberts,
2016).
Classical
studies
in
rodents housed in seminatural conditions (Calhoun, 1962; Henry &
Stephens, 1977) also showed that high population density corre-
sponded to a high number of animals showing signs of stress
pathology, including cardiovascular disease, leading to high mortal-
ity. Since then, rodent models manipulating social stress and social
rank have been developed in young, adult, and mature individuals,
causally linking chronic stress to disparate pathologies (Bale &
Epperson,
2015;
Krishnan
et al.,
2007;
Lassance-Soares
et al.,
2014; Pryce & Fuchs, 2017; Scharf, Sterlemann, Liebl, M€
uller &
Schmidt, 2013).
Overall, data in human and animal models call attention to the
urgent need to understand how different stressors accelerate and/or
offset aging and associated chronic diseases (Childs et al., 2017; Gil
& Withers, 2016; L�
opez-Ot�
ın, Blasco, Partridge, Serrano & Kroemer,
2013). Nevertheless, in spite of available evidences on the mecha-
nisms regulating aging and stress responses (Koolhaas et al., 2011;
McEwen, 2007; Prather et al., 2015) and the profound effect of
stress on pathophysiology (Bartolomucci, 2007; McEwen, 2007), this
association is not mechanistically understood nor has its causation
been explored in animal models thus far.
Here, we developed a model of lifelong chronic psychosocial
stress (LCPS) in male mice, which allows identification of a causal
role for subordination stress on shortening lifespan and increasing
cardiovascular disease risk in mice. Our results demonstrate that
LCPS mice characterized by receiving high while exhibiting low
aggression or identified as subordinate (equivalent to low social rank,
a model of low SES) showed lower survival probability and increased
markers of cellular senescence compared to dominant mice. Remark-
ably, subordinate, but not dominant mice, developed spontaneous
early-stage atherosclerotic lesions. Our model is based on the estab-
lished vulnerability of male mice to chronic psychosocial stress
(Bartolomucci, 2007). Female laboratory mice do not manifest a ter-
ritorial aggression comparable to males and are generally more resili-
ent than males to most common models of social stress (Palanza,
2001). Thus, further studies are required to extend the validity of
our results to female mice.
Our findings demonstrate a conserved role for the negative
impact of
social
stress on
survival
implicating
mechanisms of
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, while providing a functional
explanation to epidemiological and experimental human data as well
as a biological platform to investigate the impact of psychosocial
stress on aging-related diseases and survival.

2.1

Low survival probability in mice receiving high
aggression while manifesting a passive coping style
Our working hypothesis was that the degree of aggression exhib-
ited/received and the achieved social status would impact health-
span and lifespan in mice analogous to the effect of SES on disease
susceptibility and life expectancy in humans. To test this hypothesis,
we developed a lifelong chronic psychosocial stress (LCPS) model.
Operationally, for the purpose of this study, a 4-week long CPS
phase, characterized by daily aggressive interaction and sensory
(sight, sound, and smell) cohousing, was followed by an aging phase,
characterized by lifelong sensory housing in the absence of overt
aggressive interactions (Figure 1a). C57BL/6J male mice were ran-
domly paired to resident males of either the CD1 or the Sv129Ev
strain to attain exposure to a gradient of territorial aggression,
reportedly higher in CD1 (Bartolomucci et al., 2010; Dadomo et al.,
2011; Zou, Storm & Xia, 2013). High-fat diet (HFD) was previously
reported to exacerbate stress-induced metabolic syndrome-like (San-
ghez et al., 2013) and to shorten lifespan (Baur et al., 2006), prompt-
ing us to test the hypothesis that there could be an interaction
between stress and hypercaloric diet on survival. Thus, half the mice
were randomized to HFD feeding during the last 3 weeks of the
CPS phase according to our established protocol (Razzoli et al., 2016;
Sanghez et al., 2013, 2016). HFD was limited to 3 weeks as chronic
HFD per se has a marked effect on lifespan (Baur et al., 2006). The
aging phase started subsequently by maintaining the two pair mem-
bers cohoused in sensory contact until spontaneous death, thus
mimicking a lifelong stress threat.

 Mice were stratified according to their aggressive behavior by
applying an unbiased cluster analysis to aggression exhibited/re-
ceived during the CPS phase that identified four clusters (C)
(Figure 1b–d). Cluster 1 (C1, N = 58) was composed of individuals
that received and exhibited low aggression (Figure 1d) (similar to
standard group housing); C2 (N = 49) was composed of mice that

 received high levels of aggression while exhibiting little aggression
(similar to animals of low in social rank); C3 (N = 51) subjects received
low aggression while themselves expressing high amount of agonistic
behaviors (similar to animals of high social rank); finally, C4 (N = 14)
was composed of individuals receiving and exhibiting high levels of
aggression (typical of unstable social hierarchies) (Brain & Parmigiani,
1990). As evident in Figure 1c, the frequency of subjects within each
cluster exhibiting or experiencing a given level of aggression was lar-
gely overlapping for C1 or C4, while they were opposite in C2 and C3.
Remarkably, this contextual aggression-dependent clustering cor-
responded to a very striking difference in survival outcome. Subjects
receiving high aggression and having an otherwise passive coping
style in terms of aggression exhibited (C2) had the worst survival
outcome and a significant increase in the hazard ratio compared to
all the other clusters (Figure 1e–f).
Notably, individuals experiencing either low overall aggression
similar to standard group housing (C1), or high interindividual aggres-
sion (C4), or establishing a clear pattern of social dominance (C3),
had overlapping survival trajectories and hazard ratios (Figure 1e–f)
that also matched the expected survival probability for this strain
(Mitchell et al., 2014; Turturro et al., 1999). Conversely, our a priori
experimental design-included factors such as pairing with a high/low
aggressive strain or high/standard fat diet that had no effect on
mouse survival (Figure S1a–b). Our results reveal that low survival
probability is not caused by the absolute amount of aggression
received unless this is experienced by an animal that does not recip-
rocate but rather manifests a passive coping style.

Subordination stress shortens lifespan in mice
One critical finding of our study is that Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 had
opposite distributions of aggression received/exhibited representa-
tive of animals belonging to a low and high social rank, respectively,
according to the classical ethological definition of social hierarchy
(Bartolomucci, 2007; Sapolsky, 2005). Thus, we reanalyzed our data-
set based on the more restrictive standard definition of achieved
dominant and subordinate social status (see methods; Figure 2a) pre-
viously shown to explain individual vulnerability to cardiovascular
(Costoli et al., 2004), metabolic (Sanghez et al., 2013), and psychi-
atric (Bartolomucci et al., 2010) disorders.
Subordinate mice had a significantly shorter lifespan compared
to dominant animals (Figures 2b and S1c), with the distribution of
frequency of age at death that peaked earlier than for dominant ani-
mals (Figure 2c). The curve describing the survival probability of sub-
ordinate mice corresponded to a 12.4% decrease in the median
lifespan and to a significant decline in the maximal lifespan compared
to dominant mice (Figure 2b,d). Subordinate status corresponded to
a significant hazard ratio of 1.75 compared to being dominant (Fig-
ure 2d). The negative impact of the achieved subordinate status on
survival did not interact with the diet (Figure S1d).

 Overall, the difference in survival between subordinate and dom-
inant groups largely reproduced the difference between the C2 and
the C3 groups (Figure 1e). Importantly, the lifespan of the dominant
group was comparable to the C1, C3, and C4 groups (Figure 1e,f)
and to the expected survival rate for the C57BL/6J strain thus sug-
gesting that dominant could be considered a reference group for
aging-associated conditions in our study. Overall, these results
demonstrate that the low survival probability is an intrinsic charac-
teristic of animals achieving a subordinate status.

Subordination stress impairs healthspan in
mice
To gain insights on the life trajectories produced by the LCPS model,
healthspan assessments were conducted regularly throughout the
duration of the study (Figure 3). During the CPS phase, subordinate
mice developed hyperglycemia when fed both a STD or a HFD (Fig-
ure 3a), a finding which is consistent with our previous work
(Sanghez et al., 2013) and that could have set the stage for a later
metabolic dysregulation and impact later survival outcomes (Fink,
Kolterman,
Griffin
&
Olefsky,
1983;
Houtkooper
et al.,
2011).
Subordinate mice were also characterized by increased body weight
when fed a STD (Figure 3b–d) despite eating comparably to domi-
nant mice (Figure 3e) that resulted in a greater food efficiency (Fig-
ure 3f). The vulnerability to HFD-induced obesity was similar among
the two groups probably due to the large hyperphagia shown by the
dominant mice (Figure 3b,c). This finding in the C57BL/6J strain is at
variance with previous data obtained in CD1 mice (Sanghez et al.,
2013; Bartolomucci et al., 2009) thus suggesting a strain difference
in metabolism (Fengler et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2013).

entire study duration (g–k), they were statistically analyzed only until 12 months after stress (shaded areas), a point upon which the number of
missing samples started exceeding 5% thus affecting the analytical power [78]; missing data from animals not surviving to 12 months after
stress (3.76%) were not treated nor included in this analysis. Different letters represent statistical differences between groups. (l) Fecal

 During the aging phase, the effect of HFD on metabolism van-
ished rapidly after its discontinuation (Figure 3g–k). Nevertheless,
subordinate mice developed a significant lifelong hyperphagia (Fig-
ure 3k) and increased fat-free mass (Figure 3j) compared to domi-
nant mice. Subordinate mice also showed elevated levels of fecal
corticosterone metabolites (measured after 2 months of the aging
phase) compared to dominant mice (Figure 3l), suggesting sustained
activation of the HPA axis as a consequence of the achieved status.
Overall, these data demonstrate a significant and long-lasting effect
of the achieved subordinate status on mice healthspan. As the meta-
bolic effects of HFD vanished after its discontinuation, diet as an
experimental factor was not included in subsequent pathological and
biomarker analyses conducted on 17-months old mice (see below).
2.4

Subordination stress induced an earlier onset
of aging-associated diseases and increased cellular
markers of senescence
In an attempt to determine the cause of death, we conducted
macroscopic evaluation of lesions detectable at necropsy on all mice.
Macroscopic examination revealed that subordinate mice presented
an earlier onset of dissectible lesions in most of the organs exam-
ined, a finding which is in line with their lower survival probability
(Figure 4a,b). However, no organ-specific prevalence could be identi-
fied to account for the differential mortality between the two groups
(Figures 4a,b and S2). Interestingly, for both dominant and subordi-
nate mice, the higher the number of lesions, the longer the lifespan,
indicating an age-related accumulation of nonlethal organ lesions
and tumors (Figures 4a,b and S3).
To gain a mechanistic comprehension of this outcome, we con-
ducted a second LCPS experiment in which subordinate and domi-
nant mice were sacrificed when 17 months old (Figure S1e), an age
chosen to anticipate the expected rapid decline in the survival curve
typical of this strain (Baker et al., 2016; Mitchell et al., 2014; Tur-
turro et al., 1999), allowing collection of well-preserved organs for
molecular and histopathological analyses. Firstly, we determined the
expression of some of the classic cellular markers of senescence
including p53, p16Ink4a, HMGB1, and telomere length (Baker et al.,
2016; Campisi, 2013; Childs et al., 2017) in liver and spleen (organs
chosen for showing the highest level of lesions, Figure S2). Subordi-
nate mice showed a significant increase in p53, a tissue-specific sig-
nificant decrease in HMGB1, and a nearly statistically significant
increase in p16Ink4a when compared to dominant mice (Figure 4c,d),
while telomere length was similar to the one from dominant subjects
(Figure S4). Overall, these results are consistent with accelerated cel-
lular senescence in subordinate mice.
2.5
|
Earlier onset but no increased frequency of
tumors in subordinate mice
Given the known association between cellular senescence, cancer,
and aging (Campisi, 2013), we asked whether the difference in social
status during the LCPS led to differences in cancer prevalence that
might underlie the survival effect. Although subordinate mice pre-
sented an earlier onset of tumors macroscopically detectable at
autopsy, their incidence or spectrum was not different between the
two groups, thus excluding solid tumors as a factor explaining the
detrimental
effect
of
achieved
subordinate
status
on
survival
(Figure 4a,b; Figures S2 and S3a–c). Similarly, the analysis of sternum
specimens, known to harbor most of the pathologies recognized as
cause of death in C57BL/6J male mice (Brayton, Treuting & Ward,
2012), did not return any leukemia-associated sign (Figure S3d–f),
which was therefore discarded as a prominent cause of status-
dependent difference in survival.
2.6
|
Spontaneous occurrence of early-stage
atherosclerotic lesions in subordinate mice
Having ruled out a critical role for common tumors as the more likely
explanation for the social status difference in survival, we focused on
cardiovascular diseases based on their established association with
stress, aging, and senescence (Costoli et al., 2004; Roth et al., 2015).
We analyzed heart samples of LCPS mice sacrificed at 17 months of
age to determine occurrence of myocardial damage or atherosclerosis.
Remarkably, and unexpectedly, 50% of subordinate but none of the
dominant mice manifested early-stage commissural atherosclerotic
lesions (Figures 5 and S5), while fibrosis was not different between
the two groups (Figure 5g). Exclusive to subordinate, atherosclerotic
lesions were mostly found in the region of the tunica media of the
aortic sinus and presented a mature appearance as they were charac-
terized by significantly increased immune cell infiltration (Figure 5c,f)
as well as rupture, and calcification (Figure 5a,b,d,e). Consistently,
subordinate mice showed increased expression of hepatic genes impli-
cated in lipid and cholesterol metabolism when compared to dominant
mice (Figure 5h).
Occurrence of atherosclerotic lesions in subordinate mice repre-
sents an unexpected and exceptional outcome (von Scheidt et al.,
2017) suggesting that increased risk of cardiovascular disease is a
critical pathogenic mechanism in relation to subordination stress-
induced decrease in lifespan.

DISCUSSION
Increased life stress and low SES are known risk factors for disease
and reduced lifespan in humans (Marmot et al., 1991; Stringhini
et al., 2017). Our study demonstrates a conserved role for social
stress on shortening lifespan and increasing the risk of cardiovascular
disease in a mouse model and identified a potential mechanistic link
for this complex phenomenon.
Specifically, our model of LCPS identifies for the first time a causal
relationship between the severity of the stressful environment (as
quantified by aggressive behavior) and the individual coping style with
reduced lifespan, suggesting a functional explanation to the concept
of health disparity typical of low SES groups (Epel & Lithgow, 2014;
Evans & Kim, 2010). Our results find support in results showing how

 the impact of stress on cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases is mod-
ulated by a passive or reactive coping style in response to stressful sit-
uations (Koolhaas et al., 1999). Consistently, subordinate male mice,
corresponding to subjects characterized by high aggression received
and low aggression exhibited, manifested HPA axis upregulation that
is one of the common markers of chronic stress and allostatic load
(McEwen, 1998; Seeman et al., 1997), which might set the stage for
metabolic disease thus compromising healthspan. Subordinate mice
also showed transient hyperglycemia and lifelong hyperphagia. The
impact of hyperphagia on shortening lifespan of subordinate mice can
be understood in light of the established effect on longevity attributed
to calorie restriction (CR) (Balasubramanian, Howell & Anderson,
FIGURE 4

 2017; Mitchell et al., 2014). Although the maximal benefits of CR
depend on several contextual factors (i.e., species and strain (Ingram &
de Cabo, 2017)), CR attenuates age-associated metabolic diseases
allowing to preserve metabolic flexibility and limiting lipodystrophy
and hepatic metabolic consequences (Mitchell et al., 2014). It can be
speculated then that the same mechanisms altered by CR to extend
longevity might become altered in an opposing way in subordinate
mice resulting in aberrant lipid metabolism and dyslipidemia (Sanghez
et al., 2013, 2016), compromising metabolic efficiency and accelerat-
ing physical wasting, overall contributing to earlier mortality.

 Subordination stress was also associated with the emergence of
cellular senescence biomarkers such as increased p53 and decreased
HMGB1 (and a nearly statistically significant increase in p16), but
not others such as absolute telomere length. In landmark studies,
Epel and colleagues (Blackburn, Epel & Lin, 2015; Epel et al., 2004)
identified the association between exposure to life stress, shortening
of leukocyte telomeres, and mortality in humans. The discrepancy
with our current results could be attributed to intrinsic factors such
as tissue specificity, species, and gender in the measure of telomere
length (Sanders & Newman, 2013). Nevertheless, the combination of
decreased HMGB1 (Davalos et al., 2013) and increased cell cycle
inhibitors [p53 and p16Ink4a (Childs et al., 2017)] are in line with the
emergence of cellular senescence that can be associated with the
development of tissue pathology and earlier mortality in subordinate
mice. This hypothesis is supported by studies demonstrating that
accumulation of senescent cells is causal in driving aging-associated
pathologies. For example, the ablation of senescent cells using the
INK-ATTAC or the p16-3MR technologies, pharmacologically target-
ing the Ink4a transcriptionally active promoter in senescent cells,
extended lifespan and improved healthspan in mice (Baker et al.,
2011, 2016; Childs et al., 2016).
One of the major findings of our study is the occurrence of
early-stage atherosclerotic lesions in subordinate mice. Atherosclero-
sis represents an unexpected outcome in a species where this car-
diovascular disease only develops in genetically predisposed strains
under severe atherogenic dietary regimens (von Scheidt et al., 2017).
Current and previous data point to hyperglycemia, insulin resistance,
lipotoxicity,
chronic
low
grade
inflammation,
dyslipidemia,
and
increased catecholamines and glucocorticoids as likely contributors
to the development of early-stage atherosclerosis in subordinate
mice (Bartolomucci, 2007; Du et al., 2016; Heidt et al., 2014; Najafi
et al., 2013; Razzoli, Karsten, Yoder, Bartolomucci & Engeland, 2014;
Sanghez et al., 2013, 2016). Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular dis-
ease are among the major aging-associated conditions in humans,
and psychosocial factors such as job strain, low SES, and depression
have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases
and decreased lifespan (Kaplan & Manuck, 1999; Marmot et al.,
1991; Rosengren et al., 2004; Shively, Register & Clarkson, 2009).
Chronic stress can precipitate plaque progression in APOE�/� mice,
increased sympathetic nervous system activation, HPA axis-stimu-
lated angiogenesis prompting inflammation with macrophage infiltra-
tion, and intraplaque hemorrhage (Heidt et al., 2014; Najafi et al.,
2013; Wang et al., 2015). Notably, clearing senescent cells using
either genetic approaches or senolytic drug treatments limits the
development of atherosclerosis in the Ldlr�/� (Childs et al., 2017)
or the APOE�/� (Wang et al., 2015) mouse models, a mechanism
which is consistent with the phenotype of the subordinate mice and
suggests a possible senescence-associated link between stress and
atherosclerosis.
While the full mechanistic comprehension of this phenomenon is
beyond the scope of the present study, the evidence we presented
composes a coherent picture of a metabolic dysregulation that fol-
lows the emergence of the acquisition of a low rank, subordinate
status. A passive behavioral coping style in the face of lifelong psy-
chosocial stress sets the stage for sustained hyperphagia and HPA
hyperactivation overall leading to metabolic dysfunctions. Over time,
these physiologic insults would favor the emergence of cellular
senescence and predisposition to cardiovascular dysfunctions leading
to reduced lifespan.
In conclusion, we developed a mouse model of lifelong chronic
psychosocial stress and identified a causal link between high aggres-
sion received in the presence of a passive coping style as well as
achieved subordinate status, and shorter lifespan in male mice. These
findings provide a possible functional explanation to the established
association between high stress exposure and low SES and lower
survival in humans. Our data also suggest a mechanistic link between
stress-induced hyperphagia, chronically upregulated HPA axis as well
as cellular senescence with cardiovascular disease, and reduced life
expectancy in mice and, possibly, in humans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1
|
Animals
C57BL/6J (Jackson Labs), CD1 (Charles River Labs), and Sv129Ev
(Taconic Farms) male mice were purchased at 10 weeks of age and
housed at 12:12 hr light:dark cycle at 22 � 2°C. At 12 weeks of
age, mice were randomly allocated to the experimental conditions.
The diets (Research Diets, Inc.) used in this study were as follows: a
standard diet (D12405B), a high-fat diet (D12451), and a mature
rodent maintenance diet (D10012M). Cages contained corn cob bed-
ding that was changed every 7 days. Cotton nestlets were placed in
the cages for enrichment. Animal experiments were approved by the
IACUC, University of Minnesota.

Lifelong chronic psychosocial stress model
The LCPS model consisted of a baseline phase of 5 days, during
which all mice were singly housed all in one room, followed by a 4-
week CPS phase in which mice were exposed to daily defeats and
sensory contact housing (enabled by a wire mesh partition bisecting
the cage into two symmetrical compartments, each with food and
water available at libitum), and an aging phase lasting until sponta-
neous death or moribund status (Figure 1a). In the aging phase, mice
were housed in sensory contact thus experiencing a continued
degree of threat stress related to the previous encounters.
The CPS was conducted essentially as previously described
(Sanghez
et al.,
2013;
Bartolomucci
et al.,
2009).
Briefly
each
C57BL/6J (N = 172) male mouse, representing the experimental sub-
ject, was randomized using a simple randomization procedure of flip-
ping a coin (Suresh, 2011) to be transferred as intruder to the home
cage of either a CD1 (N = 86) or Sv129Ev (N = 86) resident mouse.
The CD1 strain manifests high territorial aggression, while the
Sv129Ev manifests a much lower level of territorial aggression and
can thus be considered a weaker dominant (Bartolomucci et al.,
2010; Dadomo et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2013). Resident and intruder

 mice were allowed to freely interact for a maximum of 10 min. After
the interaction, resident and intruder mice were separated by a perfo-
rated partition, which allowed continuous sensory contact but no
physical interaction. The partition was removed daily (between 8:30
and 9:30 a.m.), for a maximum of 10 min. During the social interaction,
offensive behaviors of the animals were manually recorded. Further-
more, social status was determined as previously established. Specifi-
cally, subordinate social status was defined by the display of upright
posture, flight behavior, and squeaking vocalization (Bartolomucci
et al., 2010; Dadomo et al., 2011). After 1 week, half the dyads were
randomized to a STD or a HFD using a simple randomization proce-
dure of flipping a coin. Only dyads (N = 56 dominant and N = 61 sub-
ordinate)
that
reliably
showed
a
stable
dominant/subordinate
hierarchy and in which the subordinate showed no attack after the
fourth day of interaction were included in the analysis of the rank
effect on healthspan and lifespan. As expected, most of the C57BL/6J
acquiring a dominant status were paired with a Sv129Ev (43/56),
while most of the C57BL/6J acquiring a subordinate status were
paired with a CD1 (53/61).
After the conclusion of the CPS phase, the mice entered the
aging phase of the study when each subordinate/dominant pair was
kept in sensory contact in the same housing cage with the partition
in place until spontaneous death occurred. The only procedures per-
formed in this phase were the periodic healthspan assessments as
detailed below. During the aging phase, all mice were fed standard
diet. Finally, from the age of 10 months, all mice were switched to
the mature rodent maintenance diet (D10012M) because of its bet-
ter balance of essential nutrients tailored for aged rodents (Reeves,
Nielsen & Fahey, 1993).
This study was designed to analyze the survival of the C57BL/6J
mice as a function of a priori experimental variables such as pairing
with either CD1 or Sv129Ev male mouse and diet, as well as a func-
tion of unbiased clustering of mice based on aggression received/ex-
hibited. Furthermore, we used a design intended to expand upon
past research which had examined the association with sponta-
neously achieved social status (dominant vs. subordinate) on health-
span (e.g., Bartolomucci et al., 2010; Sanghez et al., 2013) to
examine the contribution of social status to longevity. The design
employed a randomized experimental manipulation (described above)
to increase the variability in achieved status thereby increasing the
plausible variance in outcomes explained by the achieved status and,
consequently, increasing statistical power and reducing the propor-
tion of any relation between achieved status and subsequent out-
comes due to potential confounding variables. In this study, we
focus primarily on the proximal relation (and by implication plausible
effect) of achieved status on healthspan and lifespan.
Mortality (age at death) was the study primary outcome. Animals
were checked daily to determine vital status, and date of death was
recorded to the nearest day. Mice found dead at each daily inspec-
tion were considered as censored deaths and were necropsied for
tumor inspection. Criteria for euthanasia were based on an indepen-
dent assessment made by an institutional veterinarian, and only
cases
where
the
condition
of
the
animal
was
considered
incompatible with continued survival are represented as deaths in
the curves and censored to day of euthanasia. Conditions considered
cause for euthanasia, as approved by the IACUC, University of Min-
nesota included the following: prolonged respiratory distress, tumor
growth that impedes activity such as motion, eating or drinking, sev-
ere deformities or self-mutilation, inability to eat or drink, or ataxia
that prevents normal functions of eating and drinking.

Healthspan analysis
Body weight and food intake were measured weekly, while body
composition (Echo MRI 3-in-1, Echo Medical System) and 4-hr fast-
ing glucose collected via tail snip (Accuceck-Aviva, Roche) were
recorded at baseline and at the end of the CPS phase. During the
aging phase, the same health span parameters were assessed every
2 months, from 2 months up until 14 months after the end of the
stress phase, and from then to completion every 4 months.

Corticosterone metabolite analysis
To accurately follow the secretion of glucocorticoids in our mice
without interfering with the activation of the HPA axis by repeated
handling and blood sampling, a noninvasive technique was applied to
monitor adrenocortical activity by measuring corticosterone metabo-
lites (CM) in the feces of mice. This technique of glucocorticoid
metabolite quantification in fecal samples has been established in an
increasing number of species and has been extensively validated for
laboratory mice (Touma, Palme & Sachser, 2004). Fecal samples were
collected 2 months after the end of the CPS and were analyzed for
immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites using a 5a-pregnane-
3b,11b,21-triol-20-one enzyme immunoassay (EIA) according to pub-
lished methods (Heinzmann et al., 2014). Before EIA analysis, the
fecal samples were dried (2 hr at 80°C), homogenized, and aliquots
of 0.05 g of powdered feces were extracted with 1 ml of 80%
methanol. The EIA was performed on protein A-coated microtitre
plates. After overnight incubation (at 4°C) of standards (range: 0.8–
200 pg/well) and samples with steroid antibody and biotinylated
label, the plates were emptied, washed, and blotted dry, before a
streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added. After 45-
min incubation time, plates were emptied, washed, and blotted dry.
The substrate (tetramethylbenzidine) was added and incubated for
another 45 min at 4°C before the enzymatic reaction was stopped
with 1 mol/L sulfuric acid. Then, the optical density (at 450 nm) was
recorded with an automatic plate reader, and the steroid concentra-
tions were calculated. The intra- and interassay coefficients of varia-
tion were 8.8% and 13.4%, respectively.

Senescence biomarkers and pathological
analysis study
In a second experiment, 70 C57BL/6J, 35 CD1, and 35 Sv129Ev
mice purchased from the respective vendor at 10 weeks of age and
exposed to LCPS. Of these 70 C57BL/6J, 21 achieved dominant (all
10 of 14 |
RAZZOLI ET AL.
 mice paired with a Sv129Ev) and 31 achieved subordinate social sta-
tus (26/31 when paired with a CD1). Mice were sacrificed at
17 months of age for the collection of tissue specimens, at which
time they were in apparent good health as this age precedes the
rapid decline of the lifespan curve typical of this strain. These ani-
mals are not included in the survival analysis of the lifespan study.
Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation in the morning (between 8
and 10 a.m.). The dissection was performed as rapidly as possible
following euthanasia. Major organs were removed, cut into appropri-
ate size pieces, and either flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, or placed in
4% PFA for preservation. Flash-frozen tissue samples were stored at
�80°C. After several days of PFA fixation at room temperature, tis-
sue fragments were transferred to 70% ethanol and stored at 4°C.
Specimens of sternum were decalcified for 3 hr by “Decalcifying
Solution-Lite” (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). All dissectible
tumors were analyzed and eight animals per group were randomly
selected to conduct the senescence markers, heart morphology, and
immunohistochemistry analyses as detailed below.
4.6

Histological analysis
Fixed lung, liver, and sternum samples were embedded in paraffin,
and 4-lm-thick sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated
through graded alcohol to water and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. Histopathological analysis of tumors was conducted by a certi-
fied pathologist blinded to animal’s condition of social status.
The heart morphometric analysis and IHC were conducted at the
University of Washington Pathology Core facility. Formalin-fixed
hearts were cut horizontally at midventricular level into two halves
and paraffin embedded. The upper part was consecutively cut and
all sections collected. Next, six 4-lm heart sections covering 100 lm
of aortic sinuses were selected and stained with Movat, Alizarin Red
S, and Mac-2 staining protocols. To identify calcium in tissue sec-
tions, a standard protocol for Alizarin Red S staining was used. Cal-
cium forms an Alizarin Red S-calcium complex in a chelation process,
and the orange-red product is birefringent. The rat anti–Mac-2 anti-
body was used (1:3,000, Cedarlane; Hornby, Ontario, Canada) to
detect infiltrating monocytes/macrophages. For each animal, the aor-
tic sinuses were photographed under 1009 magnification and quan-
tified by computer image analysis (IMAGEPRO
PLUS image analysis
software) for lesion size and calcium content. A degree of macro-
phage infiltration was semiquantitatively scored from 0 to 3. Addi-
tionally, a 4-lm midventricular cross sections of myocardium stained
with Picrosirius Red stain (PSR) (Direct Red 80, Sigma, Saint Louis,
MO, USA) were analyzed for fibrosis. Stained sections were pho-
tographed using standard and polarized light for birefringence prop-
erties and morphometrically measured.

Absolute telomere length
Absolute telomere length was determined according to published
protocol (O’Callaghan & Fenech, 2011). DNA from spleen and liver
was isolated using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) with slight
modification of adding 1 mM DTT to eluate. Briefly, a standard curve
of known quantities of a synthesized 84 mer oligonucleotide con-
taining only TTAGGG repeats was generated based on CT (cycle
threshold) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). A standard
curve using the single copy gene, 36B4, was generated to serve as a
control for amplification and to determine genome copies per sam-
ple. For both standard curves using synthesized oligomers, 20 ng of
plasmid DNA (pBR322 Vector, New England Biolabs) was loaded in
all wells. For samples, 20 ng of DNA was loaded in triplicate. Syn-
thesized oligomers and primer sequences for qPCR in Table S2 and
all samples were processed on a 96CFX real-time system (Bio-Rad).

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted
according to standard protocols (Razzoli et al., 2016). Table S2 lists
primer information. The best keeper was generated from beta-actin
and TFIIB reference genes (Pfaffl, Tichopad, Prgomet & Neuvians,
2004) and used to normalize target gene values according to the
comparative threshold DCT. Gene expression data are presented as
normalized linear-transformed values (2-DCT) relative to the domi-
nant group.

Western Blot
Protein lysates were obtained by homogenizing tissue in RIPA buffer
(50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM NaCl). 25 lg of protein was
resolved on 4%–15% acrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF mem-
branes, and probed overnight with primary antibodies: HMBP1
(3935S), p53 (32532S), and tubulin (2146S) from Cell Signaling and
p16 (Abcam, Ab51243). Membranes were incubated with goat anti-
rabbit-HRP secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2004)
and then ECL was applied to generate signal and imaged with Che-
miDox MP imaging system (Bio-Rad). Intensities of protein detection
were quantified using IMAGEJ2.

Statistical analysis
The survival analyses were implemented in R Studio from scratch
using the methodological references given below. Survival probability
was assessed
through the
use
of
the
nonparametric
log-rank
(Mantel-Haenszel) test to compare the differences in Kaplan–Meier
survival curves using the “survival” package of the R language. When
significant, binary comparisons were conducted using Bonferroni cor-
rected log-rank test performed between two groups of interest at a
time. The same survival package was used to fit the Cox propor-
tional hazard model to actual lifespans to calculate the hazard ratio
(HR). Median and maximum survival were assessed using Fisher’s
exact test to determine statistical significance. Maximum lifespans
were calculated as the proportion of either dominant or subordinate
mice still alive when the total population reached 90% mortality

 (Hofmann et al., 2015). Cluster analysis was conducted on the data
of aggression exhibited and received by the experimental subjects
that were partitioned through k-means clustering; Ward’s method
was then used for hierarchical clustering based on a Euclidean dis-
tance matrix using the “cluster” package of the R language. Food
intake, body weight, body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass),
and glucose were analyzed with a two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) design (main factors: achieved social status and diet) and
with a two-way ANOVA design for repeated measures (main factors:
achieved status and diet by time) with Tukey’s post hoc comparisons
for binary comparisons. Bonferroni correction was applied
for
repeated comparisons between groups. Comparisons was applied for
the
histopathology
and
molecular
data
were
performed
using
unpaired t tests. A p value of ≤.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant for these outcomes. Analyses were performed using R (Version
0.99.891—© 2009-2016 RStudio, Inc.) or Statistica 13.0 (Dell Inc.,
Tulsa, OK). Data are expressed as means � standard error of the
mean (SEM).
