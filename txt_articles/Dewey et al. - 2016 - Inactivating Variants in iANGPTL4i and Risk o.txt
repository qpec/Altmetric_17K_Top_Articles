Abstract
BACKGROUND—Higher-than-normal levels of circulating triglycerides are a risk factor for 
ischemic cardiovascular disease. Activation of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that is inhibited by 
angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), has been shown to reduce levels of circulating triglycerides.
METHODS—We sequenced the exons of ANGPTL4 in samples obtain from 42,930 participants 
of predominantly European ancestry in the DiscovEHR human genetics study. We performed tests 
of association between lipid levels and the missense E40K variant (which has been associated with 
reduced plasma triglyceride levels) and other inactivating mutations. We then tested for 
associations between coronary artery disease and the E40K variant and other inactivating 
mutations in 10,552 participants with coronary artery disease and 29,223 controls. We also tested 
the effect of a human monoclonal antibody against ANGPTL4 on lipid levels in mice and 
monkeys.
RESULTS—We identified 1661 heterozygotes and 17 homozygotes for the E40K variant and 75 
participants who had 13 other monoallelic inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4. The levels of 
triglycerides were 13% lower and the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were 
7% higher among carriers of the E40K variant than among noncarriers. Carriers of the E40K 
variant were also significantly less likely than noncarriers to have coronary artery disease (odds 
ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.92; P = 0.002). K40 homozygotes had markedly 
lower levels of triglycerides and higher levels of HDL cholesterol than did heterozygotes. Carriers 
of other inactivating mutations also had lower triglyceride levels and higher HDL cholesterol

 levels and were less likely to have coronary artery disease than were noncarriers. Monoclonal 
antibody inhibition of Angptl4 in mice and monkeys reduced triglyceride levels.
CONCLUSIONS—Carriers of E40K and other inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4 had lower 
levels of triglycerides and a lower risk of coronary artery disease than did noncarriers. The 
inhibition of Angptl4 in mice and monkeys also resulted in corresponding reductions in these 
values. (Funded by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.)
The level of serum triglycerides is, in part, heritable, and elevated levels are associated with 
a risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease.1–3 Mendelian randomization studies of genetically 
determined triglyceride levels have suggested that this association is causal.4 Two lines of 
genetic evidence have further established a causal role for serum triglycerides in the risk of 
cardiovascular disease. First, inactivating mutations in the gene encoding apolipoprotein C3 
(APOC3), a component of remnant particles, were reported to be associated with decreased 
serum triglyceride levels, a decreased burden of subclinical atherosclerosis, and a reduced 
risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease, which suggests that therapeutic modulation of 
APOC3 may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.5–7 Second, rare nonsynonymous 
variants in apolipoprotein A-V have been associated with increased serum triglyceride levels 
and a doubling of the risk of early-onset myocardial infarction.8
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the primary enzyme that hydrolyzes lipoprotein triglycerides, 
releasing free fatty acids for utilization by and clearance from tissues.9 Truncating mutations 
that increase LPL activity decrease serum triglyceride levels and the risk of cardiovascular 
disease, whereas mutations that decrease LPL function have been shown to increase serum 
triglyceride levels.10,11 Among the endogenous modulators of LPL are angiopoietin-like 3 
(ANGPTL3) and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), two related secreted proteins that inhibit 
LPL in vitro and in vivo and modulate the uptake of free fatty acids in fasting and fed 
states.12–15 Angptl4-deficient mice have better lipid metabolism and smaller atherosclerotic 
lesions than mice without this deficiency.16 Naturally occurring human mutations in 
ANGPTL4 that inactivate its protein product may provide a bridge between these 
observations in animal models and the possibility of a similar effect in humans and 
illuminate the potential clinical effects of therapeutic antagonism of ANGPTL4.
The amino acid–altering (missense) E40K variant in ANGPTL4 has been associated with 
decreased levels of triglycerides and increased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol.17 There have been conflicting reports regarding the association of this variant 
with the risk of coronary artery disease, with one report showing an increased risk18 and 
another showing a decreased risk.19 In this study, we initially examined associations 
between the presence of the E40K variant and lipid levels and coronary artery disease. We 
sought additional allelic evidence for effects of genetic inactivation of ANGPTL4 by 
examining associations of novel rare, inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4 with lipid levels 
and coronary artery disease. Finally, we explored whether therapeutic antibody inhibition of 
Angptl4 had similar effects on lipid metabolism in murine and nonhuman primate models.

 METHODS
STUDY OVERSIGHT
The human genetics studies were conducted as part of the DiscovEHR project of the 
Regeneron Genetics Center and the Geisinger Health System. The study was approved by 
the institutional review board at the Geisinger Health System. The Regeneron Genetics 
Center funded the collection of study samples, the generation of sequence data, and the 
analysis of clinical and sequence data. The first three and last three authors vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the data and all analyses. All participants provided written 
informed consent.
PARTICIPANTS, CLINICAL MEASUREMENTS, AND DISEASE DEFINITIONS
The population for the DiscovEHR human genetics study that we analyzed in this study 
included the first 42,930 enrollees of predominantly European ancestry from the MyCode 
Community Health Initiative in the Geisinger Health System. From 2007 through 2015, we 
recruited participants from outpatient primary care and specialty clinics and from the cardiac 
catheterization laboratory, as well as patients who were referred for bariatric or abdominal 
vascular surgery. We extracted clinical laboratory measurements, disease diagnosis codes 
from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), information on 
medication history, and procedural codes from the electronic health records, which covered a 
median of 15 years of clinical care.
ICD-9–based diagnosis codes were collapsed into clinical disease categories. ICD-9–based 
diagnoses required one or more of the following: a problem-list entry of the diagnosis code, 
an inpatient hospitalization-discharge diagnosis code, or an encounter diagnosis code 
entered for two separate outpatient visits on separate calendar days. We developed additional 
phenotype definitions of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes to 
capture cases with greater specificity (Table 1). Controls without coronary artery disease 
were defined as participants who had no case criteria or single-encounter or problem-list 
diagnosis code indicating coronary artery disease.
We calculated median values for serially measured laboratory and anthropometric traits, 
including levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, HDL 
cholesterol, and triglycerides, along with body-mass index, for all participants with two or 
more measurements in the electronic health records after the removal of values that were 
probably spurious (i.e., >3 SD from the median value among participants). Levels of total 
cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were adjusted for the use of lipid-altering medication by 
dividing by 0.8 and 0.7, respectively, to estimate pretreatment lipid values on the basis of the 
average reduction in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with the average statin dose.20 
Levels of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were not adjusted for the use of lipid-altering 
medication.
SEQENCING OF ANGPTL4
We extracted sequence data for ANGPTL4 from exome sequences generated and processed 
at the Regeneron Genetics Center using protocols described in the Methods section in the

 Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Sequence 
reads were aligned to the human reference build GRCh37.p13. Single-nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) and insertion– deletion (indel) sequence variants were identified with the use of the 
Genome Analysis Toolkit21,22 and annotated with the use of SnpEff.23 Inactivating 
mutations were defined as any of the following: SNVs leading to a premature stop codon, 
loss of a start codon, or loss of a stop codon; SNVs or indels disrupting canonical splice 
acceptor or donor dinucleotides; and indels with a shift in the open reading frame leading to 
the formation of a premature stop codon. Carriers of the E40K variant, which has been 
shown to block the inhibition of LPL by ANGPTL4,24 were also identified. All positions are 
reported on the basis of the reference sequence for Ensembl transcript ENST00000301455 
(RefSeq messenger RNA sequence, NM_139314). We used Sanger sequencing to confirm 
the presence of certain inactivating mutations, especially indel variants (see the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix).
ANTIBODY CHARACTERIZATION
The ANGPTL4-neutralizing, fully human monoclonal antibody (REGN1001) that was used 
in this study was derived with the use of Regeneron’s Velocimmune technology.25 Binding 
of REGN1001 human immunoglobulin G1 to human and monkey ANGPTL4 was measured 
by means of Biacore.26 Reversal by REGN1001 of ANGPTL4-induced inhibition of LPL 
activity was determined with the use of the Confluolip Continuous Fluorometric Lipase Test 
(Progen).26
INHIBITION OF ANGPTL4 IN MICE
We tested the effect of REGN1001 in male mice with a mixed genetic background (C578Bl/
6NTac for 62.5% and 129S6/SvEvTac for 37.5%) that were homozygous for human 
ANGPTL4 and for ApoE deficiency. Mice were fed ad libitum with a high-fat Western diet 
(Research Diets, D12492; 60% fat by calories). Mice received subcutaneous injections of 
REGN1001 or a control antibody of the same isotype as REGN1001. Blood was collected 
for lipid measurements after a 4-hour fast.26 All procedures in animals were conducted in 
compliance with protocols approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY INHIBITION OF ANGPTL4 IN OBESE MONKEYS
Five obese rhesus macaques (body weight, >5 kg; age, >10 years) that were being 
maintained on a high-fat diet (TAD Primate Diet, Lab Diet formulation 5L0P) received a 
single intravenous injection of REGN1001 on day 1 at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body 
weight. Serum samples were collected through day 35 and assessed for serum lipids. In a 
separate study, REGN1001 was administered in a single intravenous dose of 5 mg per 
kilogram once a week for 13 weeks to male and female cynomolgus monkeys (10 per group) 
that were placed on a high-fat diet (Western Primate Diet, 5S2T) before the initiation of the 
study. A separate control group received the same dose of vehicle control. Blood samples for 
lipid measurements were collected at baseline and at 4, 8, and 14 weeks of the study. Six 
animals from each group underwent necropsy 1 week after the last injection, whereas the 
remaining four animals were euthanized after a 15-week recovery period. Necropsies were 
performed to assess organ-specific effects of therapeutic ANGPTL4 inhibition.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We used mixed linear models of association to test for associations between genotype and 
levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, log10 HDL cholesterol, and log10 triglycerides 
under an additive model (alleles coded 0, 1, and 2 for E40 homozygotes, E40/K40 
heterozygotes, and K40 homozygotes, respectively). We included age, age squared, sex, and 
log10-transformed body-mass index as fixed-effects covariates and a genetic-relationship 
matrix, which captures population structure from ancestry and relatedness, as a random-
effects covariate. We then tested for associations between the E40K variant (with coding as 
described) and the risk of coronary artery disease using the same set of covariates except for 
log10-transformed body-mass index. Odds ratios for coronary artery disease were estimated 
with the use of Firth’s penalized likelihood method of logistic regression27 after adjustment 
for age, age squared, sex, and the first four principal components of ancestry. We estimated 
Wald 95% confidence intervals for odds ratios using standard error estimates calculated from 
P values from the mixed linear models of association.
We next used the same statistical-testing framework to identify associations between novel 
inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4 found in our study, aggregated over the gene,28 and the 
above-mentioned traits. Alleles were coded 0 for non-carriers and 1 for carriers of 
inactivating mutations. As expected on the basis of the low allele frequencies, we did not 
observe any homozygotes for other inactivating mutations at any variant site. Exomewide 
quantile–quantile plots for single-marker and gene-based burden tests are provided in 
Figures S1 through S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.
An alpha level of 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical 
analyses were performed with the use of GTCA software, version 1.2.4,29 and R software, 
version 3.2.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing). For the mouse and monkey studies, data 
are expressed as means and standard errors. Mean values were compared with the use of 
unpaired t-tests or two-way analysis of variance, as implemented in Graphpad Prism 
software, version 6.0 (Graphpad Software).
RESULTS
INACTIVATING MUTATIONS IN ANGPTL4
The clinical characteristics of MyCode participants in the DiscovEHR study are described in 
Table 1. Among 42,930 DiscovEHR study participants, we identified 1661 (3.9%) who were 
heterozygous for the E40K mutation, which had been reported to have decreased the ability 
of ANGPTL4 to inhibit LPL activity.24 There were 17 participants (0.04%) who were 
homozygous for E40K (overall allele frequency, 2.0%), which indicates that E40K is viable 
as a homozygous variant and which provided a unique opportunity to study clinical 
characteristics extracted from the electronic health records of homozygotes. We also 
identified 13 other distinct mutations that were predicted to inactivate ANGPTL4, including 
6 premature stop mutations, 5 indel mutations with a shift in the open reading frame, 1 
splice donor mutation, and 1 splice acceptor mutation (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). A total of 75 participants were heterozygous for these inactivating mutations, 
corresponding to a total carrier frequency of 1 in 572 participants. We did not observe

 homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for these genetic variants in the DiscovEHR 
population. The most frequently observed inactivating mutation was a single-nucleotide 
deletion that was predicted to result in a frameshift in the codon encoding glycine at position 
313 (G313fs), which was observed in 46 participants (carrier frequency, 1 in 933).
Association with Lipid Levels—Fasting lipid measurements were available for 33,090 
participants; 27,781 of these participants had two or more serially gathered measurements, 
with a median of six measurements per participant. Medians for each trait are shown 
according to the presence of E40K and other inactivating mutations in Table 2 and according 
to the inactivating allele in Fig. 1. Results of linear regression analysis are summarized in 
Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. The levels of triglycerides per allele were 13% 
lower among carriers of the E40K variant than among E40 homozygotes (P = 2.0×10−23), 
and the levels of HDL cholesterol per allele were 7% higher among carriers of the E40K 
variant than among E40 homozygotes (P = 1.6×10−17) (Table 2). Similar to E40K 
heterozygotes, the 75 heterozygous carriers of inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4 had 
significantly lower triglyceride levels (by 13%) than noncarriers (P = 0.02) and higher HDL 
cholesterol levels (by 9%) than noncarriers (P = 0.009) (Table 2). There were no significant 
differences in levels of LDL cholesterol or total cholesterol between carriers of E40K or 
other inactivating mutations and noncarriers.
Association with Coronary Artery Disease—We then tested for the presence of an 
association (or inverse association) between coronary artery disease and ANGPTL4 
mutations. The E40K variant was significantly less common among participants with 
angiographically defined coronary artery disease (allele frequency, 1.7%; 357 heterozygotes 
and 2 homozygotes among 10,552 cases) than among controls (allele frequency, 2.1%; 1196 
heterozygotes and 15 homozygotes among 29,223 controls), corresponding to a 19% lower 
risk of coronary artery disease per allele than the risk among E40 homozygotes (odds ratio, 
0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 0.92; P = 0.002) after adjustment for age and sex 
(Table 3). K40 homozygotes had a numerically lower risk of coronary artery disease than 
E40 homozygotes (odds ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.06 to 1.09; P = 0.07).
The novel inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4 that we identified were also less common 
among participants with coronary artery disease than among controls. Overall, 13 of 10,552 
participants with coronary artery disease (cumulative allele frequency, 0.06%) and 58 of 
29,223 controls (cumulative allele frequency, 0.1%) carried an inactivating mutation. After 
adjustment for age, sex, and ancestry, the presence of an inactivating mutation resulted in 
44% lower odds of coronary artery disease than the odds with no inactivating mutation (odds 
ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.00; P = 0.05) (Table 3). Further adjustment for status with 
respect to type 2 diabetes, smoking, and hypertension did not appreciably alter associations 
between coronary artery disease and E40K or other inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
MODULATING ANGPTL4 IN MICE AND MONKEYS
We found that the binding affinity of REGN1001 to ANGPTL4 was similar in humans and 
monkeys (binding dissociation equilibrium constant [Kd] = 0.1 to 0.4 nM) (Table S6 in the 
Dewey et al.

 Supplementary Appendix). REGN1001 effectively blocked the inhibition of LPL by 
ANGPTL4 with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.4 nM (Table S7 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Because REGN1001 does not bind to mouse Angptl4, we tested REGN1001 in 
male mice that were homozygous for human ANGPTL4 and for ApoE deficiency and that 
had a genetic predisposition to hypertriglyceridemia. REGN1001 was associated with a 
rapid and sustained reduction in plasma triglyceride levels for the 17-day duration of the 
study (Fig. 2A). In a finding that was consistent with the results of previous studies,30–32 we 
observed accumulation of lipid-filled Touton cells and lesions in the mesenteric lymph nodes 
in 21 mice receiving a high-fat diet that were treated with multiple doses of REGN1001.
In the study involving cynomolgus monkeys that were fed a high-fat diet, those that received 
REGN1001 had lower levels of serum triglycerides than the control monkeys (Fig. 2B). As 
we had found in mice, we observed accumulation of lipids in the mesenteric lymph nodes in 
three of the six euthanized female monkeys at week 14 and in one of the four female 
monkeys that underwent a 15-week recovery period. We did not observe any such 
lymphadenopathy in the male monkeys.
In the study involving five obese rhesus monkeys with dyslipidemia, four of those that 
received REGN1001 had a relative decrease from baseline of 60% in circulating triglyceride 
levels, which reached a nadir within 2 days after administration of the drug (Fig. 2C). The 
relative reduction was even more pronounced in a single monkey that had a baseline plasma 
triglyceride level of more than 1500 mg per deciliter (16.9 mmol per liter) (Fig. 2D). In this 
monkey, treatment with REGN1001 reduced triglyceride levels by more than 95%, to a 
mean (±SE) of 76±14 mg per deciliter (0.86±0.16 mmol per liter), which is close to the 
normal range of triglyceride levels in rhesus monkeys.33 The reduction in plasma 
triglycerides in the other four monkeys was maintained for 28 days before the levels returned 
to baseline levels (Fig. 2C).
OTHER CLINICAL FINDINGS IN CARRIERS
Our findings in preclinical treatment models prompted us to evaluate humans carrying 
inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4 to determine whether there was evidence of clinical 
manifestations mimicking the intestinal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy observed in mice 
and nonhuman primates treated with an ANGPTL4 antibody. We reviewed deidentified data 
from electronic health records for participants carrying E40K and other inactivating 
mutations in ANGPTL4 for information on abdominal or other lymphatic disease (Table S8 
in the Supplementary Appendix). (A full description of the clinical characteristics, vital 
status, and problem list and diagnosis-code entries for K40 homozygotes is provided in 
Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix.) We did not observe any significant difference 
among participants in the rates of diagnosis codes for abdominal lymphatic disorders, which 
were reported in 1 of 17 E40K homozygotes (5.9%), 5 of 75 heterozygotes with inactivating 
mutations (6.7%), 154 of 1661 E40K heterozygotes (9.3%), and 3831 of 41,777 noncarriers 
(9.2%). Similarly, we observed no significant difference in rates of diagnosis-code entries 
for ascites, peritonitis, malabsorption, abdominal discomfort, or diarrhea.

 DISCUSSION
By sequencing the exons of ANGPTL4 in samples obtained from 42,930 participants in the 
DiscovEHR study population, we identified more than 1600 participants who were 
heterozygous and 17 who were homozygous for the E40K variant, which has been shown to 
block the inhibition of LPL by ANGPTL4.24 In addition, we discovered 13 mutations that 
were predicted to inactivate one allele of ANGPTL4. E40K and other inactivating mutations 
in ANGPTL4 were associated with decreased levels of serum triglycerides and increased 
levels of HDL cholesterol. Homozygotes had numerically lower levels of triglycerides and 
higher levels of HDL cholesterol than did heterozygotes, which suggests a gene-dosage 
effect of the variant on these traits.
Previous studies have shown that the E40K variant is associated with alterations in levels of 
triglycerides and HDL cholesterol,17–19 but there have been contradictory claims about the 
effect of inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4 on the risk of coronary disease. In this study, 
we found that the presence of the E40K variant was associated with a 19% lower risk of 
coronary artery disease than the risk among E40 homozygotes. Furthermore, we found that 
other rare novel mutations that were predicted to inactivate one ANGPTL4 allele were also 
associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. In an exomewide search for coding 
variants associated with coronary artery disease now reported in the Journal, Stitziel and 
colleagues34 found similar reductions in the risk of coronary artery disease among patients 
with E40K and other inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4. These results provide 
independent allelic evidence that the genetic loss of ANGPTL4 function confers favorable 
lipid profiles and protection from coronary artery disease. We found that monoclonal 
antibody inhibition of ANGPTL4 in mice and nonhuman primates lowered triglyceride 
levels — a finding consistent with results in Angptl4-deficient mice15,32 — which provides 
additional evidence that modulation of ANGPTL4 affects triglyceride metabolism.
Several mechanisms may link the loss of ANGPTL4 function to protection from 
atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Lifelong, genetically determined lowering of 
triglyceride levels may reduce the burden of atherogenic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. 
However, the magnitude of the reduction in the risk of coronary artery disease as a result of 
E40K and other inactivating mutations may be greater than would be expected from 
triglyceride effects alone, given previous observations of a reduction of approximately 0.7 to 
0.8% in relative risk for every genetically associated reduction of 1 mg per deciliter (0.01 
mmol per liter) in triglyceride levels.4,6 We cannot rule out an effect of increased HDL 
cholesterol levels on the risk of coronary artery disease, though emerging evidence suggests 
that certain mechanisms of alteration in HDL cholesterol may not affect the risk of coronary 
artery disease.35 Non-HDL types of cholesterol, which are epidemiologically associated 
with coronary artery disease,36 may also mediate the apparent association between the 
presence of E40K or other inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4 and coronary artery disease 
that was observed in our study.
Our data support ANGPTL4 as a therapeutic target for inhibition through an antibody or 
other mechanism for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in humans. On the other 
hand, the data from our studies in mice receiving a high-fat diet or in obese monkeys also

 raise serious concern about whether ANGPTL4 inhibition will result in abdominal 
lymphadenopathy secondary to granulomatous lipid accumulation, as has been reported 
previously.32 It is not clear whether therapeutic antagonism of ANGPTL4 will have similar 
effects in humans. Carriers of E40K (including homozygotes) or other inactivating mutations 
in ANGPTL4 did not have increased rates of abdominal lymphadenopathy or other 
abdominal disorders, as determined from electronic health records. The potential for 
recontact and consent for additional clinical phenotyping of E40K homozygotes and carriers 
of other inactivating mutations facilitated by the DiscovEHR collaboration affords a unique 
opportunity to investigate this concern. Even if the potential benefits of ANGPTL4 blockade 
turn out to be limited by the risk of lymphadenopathy in humans, similar therapeutic benefits 
may still be achieved by blocking ANGPTL4-related proteins, such as ANGPTL8 and 
ANGPTL3, neither of which appears to be associated with lymphadenopathy in animals. 
Whether similar reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease will be observed for 
triglyceride-lowering mutations affecting other angiopoietin-like proteins such as 
ANGPTL837 and ANGPTL338–40 remains to be shown.
Our study has several limitations. First, we focused on the lipid levels and risk of coronary 
artery disease in participants with the known reduced-function–associated E40K variant and 
in carriers of splice-disrupting or frameshift mutations or premature stop, start, or loss-of-
stop codons. The likelihood that these mutations will have a significant effect on the 
function of the ANGPTL4 protein is high. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that 
other coding variants or regulatory noncoding variants may yield additional insight into the 
phenotypic effects of ANGPTL4 antagonism. Second, it is not known whether our 
observations will be generalizable to persons of non-European ancestry. Third, the 
associations with lipid levels and coronary artery disease were observed in heterozygotes. 
Whether such observations accurately reflect the phenotypic effects of a more robust 
antibody blockade is not clear.
In conclusion, we observed that inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4 were associated with 
favorable lipid profiles and that the risk of coronary artery disease was lower among persons 
with those inactivating mutations than in those without them, a finding that mirrors the 
effects of monoclonal antibody inhibition in mice and nonhuman primate models. Whether 
inhibition of ANGPTL4 will safely reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in humans 
remains to be determined.

 Figure 1. Fasting Metabolic Phenotypes in Carriers of Inactivating Mutations in ANGPTL4
Shown are genotype-specific measures for each trait among study participants with 
inactivating mutations in ANGPTL4, according to the presence of an inactivating allele in 
the single-peptide (SP), coiled-coil, and fibrinogen-like domains. The red line indicates the 
median value for all carriers of inactivating mutations. Each data point represents the value 
for a single carrier of the mutation specified above each box. The blue line indicates the 
median value for all participants who did not have an inactivating mutation in ANGPTL4 on 
sequencing. Overall, 13 of 10,552 participants with coronary artery disease and 58 of 29,223 
controls carried an inactivating mutation. The body-mass index (BMI) is the weight in 
kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. To convert the values for 
triglycerides to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.01129. To convert values for cholesterol to 
millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.02586. To convert the values for glucose to millimoles per

 Figure 2. Effect of REGN1001 on Serum Triglyceride Levels in Mice and Monkeys
Panel A shows serum triglyceride levels in fasting male mice (five in each group) that were 
homozygous for human ANGPTL4 and for ApoE deficiency before and after a single 
subcutaneous injection of monoclonal antibody (mAb) REGN1001 or control antibody at a 
dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight. Panel B shows plasma triglyceride levels in 
male cynomolgus monkeys (10 in each group) that received weekly intravenous injections of 
REGN1001 or control antibody at a dose of 5 mg per kilogram for 13 weeks. The 
triglyceride levels were evaluated before and 4, 8, and 14 weeks after study initiation. Panel 
C shows changes from baseline in plasma triglyceride levels in 4 of 5 obese rhesus monkeys 
with hyperlipidemia that received a single intravenous dose of 10 mg of REGN1001 per 
kilogram. One of the 5 monkeys with a very high triglyceride level at baseline had a 
dramatic reduction in plasma levels (Panel D). In Panels A, B, and C, values are means, and 
I bars indicate standard errors. A single asterisk indicates P<0.05, and double asterisks 
indicate P<0.001.
