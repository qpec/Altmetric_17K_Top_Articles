Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Our objectives were to explore whether the phenomenon of HbA1c ‘tracking’ occurs in individuals with type 1
diabetes, how long after diagnosis does tracking take to stabilise, and whether there is an effect of sex and age at diagnosis on
tracking.
Methods A total of 4525 individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes between 1 January 1995 and 1 May 2015 were identified
from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. Mixed models were applied to assess the variability of HbA1c levels
over time with random effects on general practices (primary care units) and individuals within practices.
Results 4525 individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes were identified in THIN over the study period. The greatest difference in
mean HbA1c measurement (−7.0 [95% CI −8.0, −6.1] mmol/mol [0.6%]) was seen when comparing measurements made
immediately after diagnosis (0–1 year since diagnosis) with those at 10 or more years (the reference category). The mean
difference in HbA1c for the successive periods compared with 10 or more years after diagnosis declined and was no longer
statistically significant after 5 years. In the stratified analysis using sex and age group there was considerable heterogeneity with
adult onset type 1 diabetes appearing to track earlier and at a lower mean HbA1c.
Conclusions/interpretation In individuals with type 1 diabetes, glycaemic control measured by HbA1c settles onto a long-term
‘track’ and this occurs on average by 5 years following diagnosis. Age at diagnosis modifies both the rate at which individuals
settle into their track and the absolute HbA1c tracking level for the next 10 years.

Introduction
Clinical practice suggests that HbA1c remains remarkably sta-
ble in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Some individuals are
consistently able to achieve good glycaemic control at repeat-
ed clinical follow-up, while others struggle to do so for any
meaningful period of time. In these latter individuals, life
events (such as pregnancy) or planned interventions (includ-
ing structured education or continuous subcutaneous insulin
infusion therapy) associate with improvements in HbA1c.
However, this improved HbA1c is often not maintained be-
yond a few years [1, 2]. This stability of HbA1c that can

 manifest over decades, or even a lifetime, has been referred to
as glycaemic ‘tracking’ [3].
Glycaemic tracking is distinct from HbA1c variability. Year
to year variability in HbA1c is a characteristic described in
individuals with pre-existing diabetes and associates with both
micro- and macrovascular disease [4, 5]. Glycaemic tracking
is also not simply the inverse of glucose variability, which is
the daily change in blood glucose that includes symptomatic
hypo- and hyperglycaemia.
It is vitally important to explore the phenomenon of
glycaemic tracking. If tracking is an inherent part of the nat-
ural history of type 1 diabetes, this would emphasise the
importance of early metabolic control after diagnosis. There
may therefore be a window of opportunity where focused
interventions set the scene for long-term glycaemic control
and facilitate cost effective allocation of time and resources.
Exploring the phenomenon of glycaemic tracking may also
provide insights into underlying mechanisms, and from there,
testable approaches to influencing the final level of HbA1c
tracking.
Glycaemic tracking remains to be well characterised.
Crucially, previous reports [3–18] have largely examined indi-
viduals with pre-existing type 1 diabetes (i.e. not from the time
of diagnosis). Those few studies that have followed individuals
from the time of diagnosis have been of limited sample size and
short duration, have examined individuals across a narrow age
group (primarily paediatric) and have not adjusted for impor-
tant confounders (e.g. socioeconomic status). These studies are
summarised in the electronic supplementary material (ESM)
Table 1 and illustrate the need to study the phenomenon of
glycaemic tracking in a more robust manner.
To explore the concept of glycaemic tracking formally, we
performed a large, UK population-based cohort study involv-
ing over 4000 individuals with newly diagnosed type 1 diabe-
tes and over 50,000 longitudinally collected HbA1c measure-
ments. We wished to establish: (1) whether the phenomenon of
HbA1c tracking occurs in individuals with type 1 diabetes; (2)
how long after diagnosis does tracking take to stabilise; and (3)
the effect of sex and age of diagnosis at tracking.
Methods
The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database is a
large primary care dataset derived from general practices
(primary care units) across the UK [19]. More than 675
practices contribute to the dataset resulting in over 14
million patient records of which around 4 million are
active participants. The database consists of individuals’
demographic details, diagnosis, prescriptions and labora-
tory results. The database is generalisable to the UK
population, and has been utilised for numerous epidemi-
ological studies, including type 1 diabetes [20].
The use of the THIN data for research was approved by the
South-East Multicenter Research Ethics Committee in 2003,
without the need for informed consent. As per the require-
ments for ethical approval, further registration and authorisa-
tion for this project were obtained from the Scientific Review
Committee of the data provider (IQVIA: 17THIN015).

tween 1 January 1990 and 1 May 2015 were identified using

 appropriate Read codes (https://digital.nhs.uk/article/1104/
Read-Codes) and based on an algorithm recently published
by Sharma et al 2016 [21]. To be classified as having type 1
diabetes, participants need to have a type 1 diabetes specific
Read code, be aged less than 40 years at diagnosis and have
been prescribed insulin but not oral hypoglycaemic
medications. Individuals were eligible to be included in the
cohort if they were diagnosed at least 1 year after registration
with the practice or a year after the practice was eligible to take
part, whichever was the latest. The date of diagnosis used was
the one recorded in the database. Participating general
practices were eligible to take part following: (1) introduction
of the computerised system; (2) the date practices were
deemed as having acceptable mortality rates. This was impor-
tant to ensure that practices were recording important infor-
mation and comorbidities accurately.
Measurement of HbA1c All HbA1c values recorded in the data-
base were extracted for the cohort of individuals with type 1
diabetes. Where the unit of measurement was percentage, values
were converted to mmol/mol for analysis. Duplicates and implau-
sible measurements (<20 mmol/mol [<4%] and >195 mmol/mol
[>20%]) were removed before the analysis. Initial HbA1c at the
time of diagnosis is often measured in a secondary care setting
and these data were therefore not available for inclusion.
Statistical analysis The analysis aimed to answer the three
aforementioned questions: does HbA1c tracking occur among
individuals with type 1 diabetes; if tracking occurs, how soon
after diagnosis does this manifest; if tracking occurs, what is
the impact of sex and age at diagnosis on the natural history of
tracking?
Sociodemographic characteristics, HbA1c levels and time
since diagnosis were summarised using descriptive statistics.
Exploratory plots were produced for the mean levels of HbA1c
vs time since diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Similar plots were
also produced stratifying by 10 year age bands and sex. The
time since diagnosis with type 1 diabetes represents the dura-
tion between the date when a particular HbA1c measurement
was taken and the initial date of diagnosis. This was divided
into 11 categories: 0–1 years, 1–2 years, 2–3 years,…, 9–
10 years and ≥10 years to facilitate modelling because our
exploratory analyses indicated that the association between
HbA1c level and time was likely to be non-linear.
Glycaemic tracking was defined as a period in which there
was no statistically significant (p < 0.05) difference in HbA1c
across adjacent years in comparison with the HbA1c measure-
ment at ≥10 years from diagnosis.
We used linear mixed effects models to assess the variabil-
ity of HbA1c levels over time with random effects on practices
and individuals within practices. These models, also known as
multilevel or hierarchical linear models, constitute both fixed
effects and random effects. The fixed part is similar to stan-
dard linear regression but the addition of random effects al-
lows the model to account for the potential effect of variability
at different grouping or clustering levels. In other words, the
random effects are variance components associated with each
level. In our study, there are three variance components, name-
ly: (1) within individual variability (the residual error associ-
ated with repeated measurements from an individual), (2) be-
tween individuals within practice variation (as several individ-
uals share the same practice), and (3) between practice varia-
tion. Individuals within the same practice may be correlated
because of a shared random intercept, through a shared ran-
dom slope on a covariate or both. Thus, both adjusted and
unadjusted two-level random intercepts and slopes (for indi-
viduals within practices) models were fitted using the
≥10 years duration group as reference. The adjusted model
included age at diagnosis (10 year bands), sex and the
Townsend index.

 The Townsend index, ranging from 1 to 5, is a measure of
material deprivation, calculated using social indices such as
income, education and employment specific to each partici-
pant’s neighbourhood [22, 23]. Socioeconomic status has
been convincingly related to glycaemic control [24] and the
Townsend index has been used extensively as a covariate in
diabetes studies using THIN database [25–27]. In the adjusted
model, the group with the longest duration of type 1 diabetes
(≥10 years) was preferred as the reference category; this is
because if individuals were to track, i.e., if the proposed hy-
pothesis was true, then we would expect to see no significant
difference between this group and groups with a lower dura-
tion of type 1 diabetes. The duration after which there is no
significant difference in the final HbA1c will be the time point
at which tracking manifests. In addition to this, a stratified
analysis will be conducted using sex and age group as strati-
fication factors.
In a sensitivity analysis, the random intercepts and
slopes model were fitted including data only from individ-
uals with 10 or more complete years of follow-up. All
analyses were performed using Stata 14 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX, USA).
Results
There were 4525 individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in
the THIN database over the study period 1995–2015 from a
total of 617 practices. The majority were male (60.6%) and the
highest proportion (38.4%) were diagnosed between the ages
of 10 and 20 years. The mean ± SD HbA1c level was 72.6 ±
20.6 mmol/mol (8.8 ± 4%) and the median follow-up after
diagnosis was 5 years (Table 1).
HbA1c increased with time from diagnosis in individuals
with type 1 diabetes and stabilised by 5 years to an average of
75.0 mmol/mol (9.0%) following this period (Fig. 1).
However, the timing of stabilisation was dependent on age
at diagnosis and sex (ESM Fig. 1).
The largest difference between mean HbA1c measure-
ments was between those taken in the first year following
diagnosis (time: 0 years in Fig. 2) and those taken after 10
or more years (the reference category) (−7.0 [95% CI −8.0,
−6.1] mmol/mol [0.6%]; Fig. 2). The mean HbA1c differ-
ence for the successive periods after diagnosis (1–2 years,
2–3 years, etc.) compared with after 10 or more years de-
clined considerably and was no longer statistically signifi-
cant 5 years following diagnosis (a duration time of 4 years
in figures illustrates HbA1cs measured between 4 and
5 years after diagnosis); the mean HbA1c difference for this
duration after diagnosis was −0.8 (95% CI −1.8, 0.2)
mmol/mol (0.7%). The findings remained similar when
analysis was restricted only to participants contributing
HbA1c measurements for 10 years and above (ESM Fig. 2).
There was considerable heterogeneity in the timing of track-
ing in the stratified analysis using sex and age group. Adult
onset type 1 diabetes seem to track earlier (Fig. 3) and at a lower
mean HbA1c (ESM Fig. 1). Children diagnosed between 0 and
10 years tracked from 6–7 years and 8–9 years after diagnosis
for boys and girls, respectively (Fig. 3a, e). For the 10–20 years
diagnosis age group, tracking occurred at 9–10 years in males
and 7–8 years in females (Fig. 3b, f). For the 20–30 years group,
tracking occurred at 2–3 years for both sexes (Fig. 3c, g).
Among the 30–40 years age group, tracking was at 4–5 years
in men (Fig. 3d) and 5–6 years in women (Fig. 3h).

 Discussion
We show that in individuals with type 1 diabetes, glycaemic
control measured by HbA1c settles onto a long-term ‘track’
and that this occurs on average by 5 years following diagnosis.
We also show that the age at diagnosis modifies both the rate
at which individuals settle into their track and the absolute
HbA1c tracking level for the next 10 years. Our analytical
approach utilising a random intercept and slope model ensures
that our overall results are not confounded by trajectories at an
individual level.
This is the first study to demonstrate the phenomenon of
glycaemic tracking on a large number of unselected, newly
diagnosed individuals with type 1 diabetes across a broad age
group and with a long period of follow-up. Crucially, this
study is unique in that the association has been adjusted for
important potential confounders such as local clinical practice
and Townsend score. The study is weakened by the fact that
adequate follow-up data are not available for greater than
10 years and that the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was taken
prima facie from the national THIN general practice database.
For this reason, we limited the analysis to those diagnosed
with type 1 diabetes under the age of 40 years, on insulin alone
and with no history of oral hypoglycaemic prescriptions.
Finally, the HbA1c assay has evolved over the course of the
time span during which this study extends. Although appro-
priate conversions were meticulously undertaken, inherent
differences in methodologies should be taken into account
when interpreting differences in HbA1c before and after
2009 in the UK. Similarly, several important changes in dia-
betes management have been introduced over the study period
such as the introduction of novel insulin formulations, wide-
spread adoption of intensive insulin treatment schemes and
revision of education systems. These may have contributed
towards an improvement of glycaemic control at a national
level and although data is missing, they should be considered
in the context of this study.
It is notable that the overall HbA1c levels in the UK are
suboptimal. This has been seen before with regard to other
countries [28]. Furthermore there is a discrepancy between
the sexes and this may relate to the higher insulin resistance
[29] and behavioural issues [30] that may be more prevalent in
younger women and girls with type 1 diabetes.
Several hypotheses, focusing on endogenous and/or exoge-
nous factors, have been suggested to underlie the phenomenon
of glycaemic tracking. Residual beta cell function, measured by
stimulated C-peptide, decays with time following type 1 diabe-
tes diagnosis [31] and low C-peptide is associated with higher
HbA1c [32, 33]. Therefore, the loss of C-peptide following
diagnosis may explain the rising HbA1c in the initial 5 years.
Alternatively, or in addition, individual patient-related factors
may contribute. Habituation of the day to day approach to
managing chronic disease can make any long-lasting change
difficult [34]. Studies involving paediatric and adolescent indi-
viduals with type 1 diabetes indicate that age, sex, body mass
index, socioeconomic factors, physical activity levels,

 frequency of glucose monitoring and personality traits can also
influence temporal HbA1c trends [16, 35–37]. It may be that a
combination of these endogenous and exogenous factors con-
tributes to the phenomenon of tracking and that both need to be
addressed for effective long-term glycaemic control.
There are two clear implications of our results. First, there is
a 5 year window during which longer-term HbA1c and there-
fore risk of diabetes complications is determined. Thus, urgent
and appropriate targeting of therapies to this period of type 1
diabetes natural history should be considered. This may in-
clude, for example, the development of a newly diagnosed type
1 diabetes pathway with structured education and aggressive
glucose control. Second, the benefits of addressing HbA1c after
the first 5 years should be explored. It has been suggested that
efforts would be better directed at risk factors other than HbA1c
in individuals with established type 1 diabetes [13]. However,
such an approach may result in loss of the tracking phenome-
non and deterioration in HbA1c so this needs to be carefully
explored. Unfortunately, data are missing with regards to both
effectiveness and timing of a focused clinical intervention
targeted at changing the track and this clinical need becomes
even more evident in light of the study findings. Furthermore, it
is worth noting that HbA1c provides only one indication of
glycaemic control. Day to day glucose variability is of greater
concern to individuals and is poorly reflected in the HbA1c
measure. Indeed, ‘real world’ experience of new interventions
such as structured education and insulin pump therapy suggest
they have had a greater benefit on glucose variability than
meaningful long-term changes to HbA1c [38, 39].
This is the first comprehensive study of the phenomenon of
HbA1c tracking and supports the need to optimise glycaemic
control early in the natural history of type 1 diabetes. Studies
are now needed to explore the mechanisms underlying this
phenomenon and how best to optimise tracking in newly di-
agnosed individuals.
