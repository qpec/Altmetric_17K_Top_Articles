Background. Mismanagement of asymptomatic patients with positive urine cultures (referred to as asymptomatic bacteriuria 
[ASB] in the literature) promotes antimicrobial resistance and results in unnecessary antimicrobial-related adverse events and 
increased health care costs.
Methods. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported on the rate of inappropriate ASB treat-
ment published from 2004 to August 2016. The appropriateness of antimicrobial administration was based on guidelines published 
by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
Results. A total of 2142 nonduplicate articles were identified, and among them 30 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The pooled 
prevalence of antimicrobial treatment among 4129 cases who did not require treatment was 45% (95% CI, 39–50). Isolation of 
gram-negative pathogens (odds ratio [OR], 3.58; 95% CI, 2.12–6.06), pyuria (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.9–4.22), nitrite positivity (OR, 
3.83; 95% CI, 2.24–6.54), and female sex (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.46–3.06) increased the odds of receiving treatment. The rates of 
treatment were higher in studies with ≥100 000 cfu/mL cutoff values compared with <10 000 cfu/mL for bacterial growth (P, .011). 
The implementation of educational and organizational interventions designed to eliminate the overtreatment of ASB resulted in a 
median absolute risk reduction of 33% (rangeARR, 16–36%, medianRRR, 53%; rangeRRR, 25–80%).
Conclusion. The mismanagement of ASB remains extremely frequent. Female sex and the overinterpretation of certain labora-
tory data (positive nitrites, pyuria, isolation of gram-negative bacteria and cultures with higher microbial count) are associated with 
overtreatment. Even simple stewardship interventions can be particularly effective, and antimicrobial stewardship programs should 
focus on the challenge of differentiating true urinary tract infection from ASB.
Keywords. antimicrobial; intervention; urinary tract infection; UTI. 
A positive urine culture for bacteria or fungi, in the absence of 
symptoms (reported in the literature simply as asymptomatic 
bacteriuria [ASB] for reasons of convenience [1]) is a com-
mon clinical finding, especially among the inpatient popula-
tion, the elderly, and patients with indwelling urinary catheters 
[2]. Antimicrobial therapy has no role in the majority of cases 
of ASB, and withholding treatment has no effect in mortality 
or renal function [2, 3]. Moreover, overtreatment of ASB may 
result in a number of undesirable outcomes, such as disturbance 
of the intestinal flora that increases the risk for Clostridium 
difficile infection, antibiotic resistance, and increased health 
care–associated costs [4, 5]. Furthermore, treatment of ASB may 
eliminate low-virulence strains that suppress the development 
of uropathogens, thus counterintuitively promoting the devel-
opment of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) [6, 7].
Responding to this challenge, the Infectious Diseases Society 
of America (IDSA) released evidence-based recommendations 
to guide health care professionals in their approach to ASB [8]. 
In spite of these recommendations, ASB remains one of the most 
common causes of antimicrobial overprescription in both acute 
[9] and long-term care [10]. For example, in a recent prospective 
study conducted among hospitalized patients, overtreatment of 
ASB contributed 17% of total antimicrobial overprescriptions 
[9]. Nonetheless, the cumulative frequency of ASB overtreat-
ment across the spectrum of care has not been well studied. The 
aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate 
the overall prevalence of ASB overtreatment. We also identified 
factors associated with increased odds of overtreatment, as well 
as quantified the efficacy of initiatives aimed at improving ASB 
management.
METHODS
This study was conducted according to the PRISMA checklist [11].

Data Sources and Search
Three researchers (MF, AK, PO) searched the PubMed and 
EMBASE databases from 2004 up to August 24, 2016, using the 
term “{asymptomatic AND (bacteriuria OR UTI OR (urinary 
tract infection)]} AND (treatment or therapy or antimicrobial 
or antibacterial or antibiotic).” We screened citations by abstract 
and title and only assessed publications in English, French, or 
Spanish. After the initial selection of eligible studies, their refer-
ences were also reviewed. We also contacted the study authors 
as needed to obtain clarifications or additional information that 
could facilitate our analysis. Case series, case reports, and confer-
ence abstracts were not considered for inclusion in our analysis.
Study Selection
We elected to begin our search for eligible studies published in 
2004, as this was the year when the IDSA guidelines on ASB 
management [8] were accepted for publication, a clear indi-
cation that at that time enough published evidence existed to 
support the withholding of treatment in ASB cases. Some of the 
studies included cases from prior to 2004, and this allowed us to 
compare the management of ASB before and after the publica-
tion of the IDSA guidelines.
To be considered for inclusion, studies had to report the total 
number of ASB cases that did not warrant antimicrobial treat-
ment according to the IDSA guidelines, as well as the number 
of cases that were inappropriately treated. Furthermore, we 
required that eligible studies clarify whether the antimicrobial 
treatment was specifically administered for the management of 
ASB and not for a different indication. Studies in which patients 
with ASB were treated within the context of a research protocol 
were excluded. Studies performed in populations undergoing 
surgical procedures with implantation of prostheses, solid organ 
transplant recipients, and patients with neobladders were also 
excluded, as no specific recommendations on these subpop-
ulations are offered by the IDSA guidelines [8]. In studies that 
reported on interventions aimed at reducing ASB overtreatment, 
only the baseline period before the intervention was considered.
Definitions
Asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined as the isolation of culti-
vatable microorganisms without the presence of symptoms and 
signs suggestive of UTI. For convenience, and in accordance 
with previous reports [1], the term “bacteriuria” was used to 
describe the presence of bacteria or fungi throughout the man-
uscript, as funguria cases are commonly included in previously 
published analyses and could not be studied separately as no 
distinct rates were provided [1, 12–14]. Instead, as detailed 
below, we performed a subgroup analysis without the studies 
that included funguria cases.
We did not employ specific cutoffs for clinically significant 
growth or impose restrictions on the number of organisms iso-
lated. This broad definition was employed to ensure that inap-
propriate treatment of ASB was adequately captured, regardless 
of whether the ASB case in question stemmed from coloniza-
tion or sample contamination. Patients with bacteriuria and 
symptoms/signs suggestive of infection were only considered to 
have ASB when the signs/symptoms could be clearly attributed 
to a different cause. In line with the IDSA recommendations [8], 
antimicrobial treatment of ASB was considered appropriate for 
pregnant patients and patients undergoing urologic procedures 
with a high likelihood of bleeding. For our secondary analy-
sis, pyuria was defined as the presence of at least 5 white blood 
cells (WBC)/high-powered field (HPF) whereas hematuria was 
defined as the presence of at least 10 red blood cells (RBC)/HPF.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Our primary outcome of interest was the rate of inappropriate 
treatment of ASB and was calculated by dividing the number of 
ASB cases in which antimicrobial therapy was inappropriately 
prescribed by the total number of ASB cases in which no treat-
ment was warranted, according to the IDSA guidelines [8]. As a 
secondary outcome, we sought to identify factors that were asso-
ciated with ASB overtreatment in the included study cohorts.
Two researchers (MF, AK) extracted data independently; 
discrepancies between them were resolved by consensus, and 
data are summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2. 
The methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed with 
the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) (see 
Supplementary Table 1) [15]. For each study parameter that 
met adequate quality standards, a star was awarded to the study. 
Studies that were judged to be of adequate quality in all 6 of 
the examined study parameters were awarded a maximum of 
6 stars. An NOS rating of 5 stars or higher was considered ade-
quate for the purposes of our analysis.
Data Analysis
The meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effects 
model, proposed by DerSimonian and Laird, to estimate the 
pooled rates and 95% confidence intervals of the primary 
outcome [16]. The Freeman-Tukey arcsine transformation 
was employed to ensure the inclusion of studies that reported 
extreme rates (rates near 0 or 1) [17]. The tau-squared statistic 
was calculated to assess the heterogeneity between the studies, 
and possible sources of heterogeneity were further explored 
by meta-regression analysis (Knapp and Hartung model) [18]. 
Using this methodology, we performed a temporal sensitiv-
ity analysis that included only the studies performed in 2006 
and after to assess the effect of the introduction of the IDSA 
guidelines on the reported rates. A subgroup analysis without 
the studies that included funguria cases was also conducted. We 
used Egger’s regression test (ET) as an indicator of small study 
effect [19]. A time-trend analysis was performed by transform-
ing the model coefficients to rates and plotting them against the 
median year along with the reported prevalence rates [20].
We also performed a secondary analysis of the studies 
that reported on factors associated with ASB treatment. This

secondary analysis only included factors that were assessed by a 
minimum of 3 studies [20]. Pooled relative effects were reported 
as unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals, 
calculated with the aid of the random-effects model. The hetero-
geneity among studies was further assessed with the tau-squared 
statistic. In studies that implemented interventions aimed at 
reducing ASB overtreatment, the absolute risk reduction (ARR) 
and relative risk reduction (RRR) that followed the intervention 
were calculated for each site and then summarized into median 
and range. To facilitate the presentation of our results, all percent-
ages reported in the text were rounded up to the nearest integer.
Statistical analysis was conducted using the STATA v. 13 soft-
ware package (STATA Corporation, College Station, TEXAS). 
Statistical significance was defined as a P value of less than .05.
RESULTS
A total of 2848 articles published from January 1, 2004, to 
August 24, 2016, were identified. Thirty studies were consid-
ered eligible and were incorporated into our analysis after qual-
ity evaluation. The selection process is depicted in Figure 1. The 
30 studies included in our analysis reported on a total of 4129 
ASB cases (Table 1) [1, 4, 12–14, 21–45]. The majority of stud-
ies were performed in North America (16 in the United States 
[1, 4, 14, 21, 26–28, 30–32, 36–38, 41, 43, 44] and 7 in Canada 
[13, 24, 25, 33, 34, 40, 42]) and Europe (3 in France [35, 39, 45], 
1 in Italy [23], and 1 in Spain [29]). Finally, 1 study each was 
performed in New Zealand [22] and South Korea [12]. Contact 
with study authors of potentially relevant articles for additional 
data and a systematic search of article references failed to yield 
additional data and studies.
Remarkably, the pooled rate of inappropriate treatment was 
45% (95% CI, 39–50; τ2, 0.08). Specifically, the rate of inappropri-
ate treatment was 45% in North America (95% CI, 38–51; 40% 
in the United States, 58% in Canada) and 47% in Europe (95% 
CI, 32–62) (Figure 2). No small study effect across the included 
studies was detected (ΕΤ, 1.01; PET, 0.161). Twenty-two out of the 
30 studies were performed in inpatient populations and had a 
rate of inappropriate treatment of 45% (95% CI, 38–51) [1, 12–
14, 21, 22, 24–28, 31, 33–36, 39–42, 44, 45]. Two were performed 
in outpatient settings [23, 29], 1 in the emergency department 
[32], 1 among nursing home residents [43], and 4 in a mixture 
of settings [4, 30, 37, 38]. Five of the studies reported rates of

inappropriate treatment among patients with indwelling urinary 
catheters, and their pooled prevalence was similar to the overall 
rate (44%; 95% CI, 34–55) [1, 24, 25, 36, 41].
In a sensitivity analysis, we pooled the rates from studies that 
were performed in 2006 or later to estimate the effect of the 
introduction of the IDSA guidelines on inappropriate treatment 
rates. For the 23 studies that were performed in the years 2006–
2014 [1, 4, 12–14, 21–24, 26, 28, 30–38, 40, 41], the pooled rate 
was 41% (95% CI, 35–47; τ2, 0.08), whereas for the 7 studies 
performed from 1996 to 2005 [25, 27, 29, 39, 43–45], it was 56% 
(95% CI, 52–61; τ2 < 0.001). This difference was statistically sig-
nificant (coeff, 0.31; P, .028), however, we noted no significant 
Heterogeneity between groups: p = .014

time trend in the subanalysis for the years 2006–2014 (P, .885), 
indicating that the potential beneficial effect from the publica-
tion of structured guidelines might have reached a plateau.
As discussed in the “Methods,” we explored the impact of 
factors potentially associated with inappropriate ASB treat-
ment. Our analysis demonstrated that patients with gram-neg-
ative isolates had a higher chance of receiving inappropriate 
treatment (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 2.12–6.06; τ2, 0.08; ΕΤ, 9.48; PET, 
0.131), based on 3 studies with 547 patients [1, 12, 21]. This was 
also the case for female patients (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.46–3.06; 
τ2 < 0.001; ΕΤ, 0.9; PET, 0.608), based on 5 studies with 891 par-
ticipants [1, 12, 13, 21, 32]. Patients with pyuria were also more 
likely to be treated inappropriately, based on 5 studies involving 
865 participants (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.9–4.22; τ2, 0.06; ΕΤ, 5.26; 
PET,  0.252) [12, 13, 31, 32, 37].
Regarding the impact of cutoffs used for detecting bacteriuria 
in the rate of inappropriate treatment, among the 30 included 
studies, 9 used a cutoff of ≥100 000 cfu/mL or higher, and 
these studies had a pooled prevalence of inappropriate treat-
ment of 53% (95% CI, 46–61) [12, 13, 23, 25, 29, 36, 40, 43, 
44]. Studies that used lower cutoffs (and thus lower bacterial 
counts) reported lower prevalence of inappropriate ASB treat-
ment. Specifically, 7 studies that used cutoffs between 10 000 
and 100 000 cfu/mL had a pooled prevalence of 44% (95% CI, 
32–57) [1, 27, 30, 32, 38, 39, 45], while 6 studies that used a cut-
off of <10 000 cfu/mL had a pooled prevalence of 38% (95% CI, 
34–42) [4, 21, 22, 31, 37, 41]. Notably, the rate was significantly 
lower among studies that utilized lower cutoff values to define 
bacteriuria (coeff, –0.15; P, .035). A significant difference was 
noted while comparing the rates reported between studies using 
cut-offs <10 000 cfu/mL vs those using ≥100 000 cfu/mL (coeff, 
–0.29; P, .011). A sensitivity analysis that recalculated the rate 
excluding studies with funguria cases [1, 12–14, 25, 36] did not 
result in any difference (45%; 95% CI, 39–51; τ2, 0.09).
Based on 4 studies with 727 patients, positivity for nitrites in 
urinalysis also increased the risk of inappropriate administration 
of antimicrobial therapy (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 2.24–6.54; τ2, 0.16; 
ΕΤ, –1.93; PET, 0.861) [12, 13, 21, 32]. Interestingly, the risk of 
inappropriate ASB treatment appeared similar among patients 
in surgical and nonsurgical units (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.67–1.55) 
[12, 13, 21, 40], as well as among patients admitted to intensive 
care units (ICUs) and those in general hospital wards (OR, 0.67; 
95% CI, 0.33–1.35) [12, 13, 21, 40]. Furthermore, no difference 
in the risk of inappropriate treatment was reported among dia-
betic vs nondiabetic patients (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.39–1.22) [12, 
13, 32], patients with indwelling urinary catheters vs noncath-
eterized patients (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.58–1.54) [12, 13, 21, 22, 
33, 44] or patients with hematuria vs those without hematuria 
(OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.76–5.16) [12, 13, 37].
Finally, among the 30 included studies, 8 reported on inter-
ventions to reduce the rate of inappropriate treatment of ASB 
from 2002 to 2013 (Supplementary Table 2). Five of these 
studies were performed in inpatient settings [13, 33, 41, 42, 45], 
1 was performed in a nursing home [43], and 2 involved differ-
ent settings [4, 30]. The duration of the baseline period varied 
from 1 to 12 months (treatment rates, 38–74%), whereas the 
intervention period varied from 2 to 30 months. Importantly, 
substantial improvements in the rate of inappropriate ASB 
treatment were reported after the implementation of these rel-
atively simple measures (medianARR, 33%; rangeARR, 16–36%; 
medianRRR, 53%; rangeRRR, 25–80%). One study reported data on 
a 1-year maintenance period after the completion of the inter-
vention; a sustained reduction was observed (29% maintenance 
vs 38% baseline treatment rate).
DISCUSSION
In the “Choosing Wisely Campaign,” the American Geriatrics 
Society and the American Board of Internal Medicine 
Foundation listed the unnecessary use of antimicrobials for 
ASB as one of the top 5 overused services [46]. We found that 
almost half of the ASB cases were managed inappropriately, a 
finding that justifies this level of concern, and the rate remained 
alarmingly high (40%), even after the introduction of the IDSA 
evidence-based recommendations. Women and patients with 
gram-negative bacteriuria had 2 and 4 times greater odds of 
being treated inappropriately, respectively. Also, overinterpre-
tation of urinalysis that places undue emphasis on the presence 
of pyuria, nitrite positivity, and higher bacterial counts appears 
to drive inappropriate antimicrobial prescription for ASB. 
Interestingly, the challenge of reducing ASB overtreatment may 
be surmountable, as relatively simple educational and/or organ-
izational interventions appear to reduce the incidence of inap-
propriate prescribing practices.
Challenges in the clinical differentiation between ASB and 
UTI may offer a partial explanation for the excessive overtreat-
ment of ASB [47]. Of note, the presence of nonspecific signs 
and symptoms or comorbid conditions in such patients can be 
misleading [26, 47]. No association between these nonurinary 
indications and the presence or absence of bacteriuria has been 
suggested, and there is no evidence to justify treating bacte-
riuria in this context [48]. Another key aspect in understanding 
overtreatment is the undue reliance on the results of laboratory 
studies. For example, in a survey of physicians at a Swiss hospi-
tal, decision-making based on laboratory findings alone was the 
most commonly reported reason for overprescribing (reported 
by 17 out of 21 participants) [49]. This suggests that practi-
tioners may decide to commence empiric treatment for UTIs 
based solely on the results of laboratory tests, without consid-
ering clinical data. Conversely, this overreliance on laboratory 
information may also explain why no association was found 
between the patient’s underlying condition as represented by 
the site of hospitalization (surgical floor, ICU) or the presence 
of diabetes and the rate of ASB overtreatment. It is possible that 
certain “danger” results in urinalysis (bacterial counts ≥100 000,

positive nitrites, pyuria, and the presence of gram-negative bac-
teria) are interpreted as strengthening the likelihood of a UTI 
diagnosis, while the patient’s history and clinical signs/symp-
toms may be given less consideration. However, as noted above, 
none of these laboratory findings has been shown to be specific 
for symptomatic UTI, and evidence-based recommendations 
discourage the use of antimicrobial agents for asymptomatic 
ASB in most cases, regardless of laboratory results [8].
Interestingly, among the 30 included studies, 8 implemented 
interventions aimed at reducing the rate of inappropriate treat-
ment. Most of these initiatives were apparently successful and 
resulted in up to an 80% reduction in the inappropriate man-
agement of ASB. Our findings support that such successful 
interventions should aim at educating providers regarding the 
existing clinical guidelines [50], the natural history of ASB, and 
the diagnostic/therapeutic pitfalls associated with differentiat-
ing ASB cases from UTI [12]. Nonetheless, educational efforts 
are only part of the answer. For example, in a recent survey 
from a tertiary care hospital, almost 50% of the participants 
demonstrated a willingness to treat ASB despite knowing that 
this was not indicated by the IDSA guidelines [12]. Fortunately, 
relatively simple measures, such as didactic sessions and audit 
and feedback, are not only effective at reducing overtreatment, 
which is highlighted by the 25–80% reduction noted among the 
included studies, but also sustainable [41]. In 2 studies [33, 42], 
the introduction of the requirement that the physician should 
contact the microbiology lab by phone in order to acquire the 
results of urine cultures yielded a 37% and 75% reduction in 
prescribing, which underlines the role of strategies to promote 
appropriate ordering of urinary cultures. Specifically, it has 
been demonstrated that a considerable percentage of urine cul-
tures ordered in everyday practice are not clinically indicated 
[34]. Importantly, unnecessary ordering of urine cultures not 
only contributes to inefficient utilization of laboratory resources 
and excess health care costs, but is also thought to drive inap-
propriate treatment of ASB [33, 34, 41, 51]. In fact, as demon-
strated in a recent major study by Trautner et al. [41], initiatives 
aiming to restrict the inappropriate ordering of urine cultures 
significantly reduced the frequency of ASB overtreatment. As 
such, “urine culture stewardship” clearly has an important role 
to play in efforts to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescription 
in the setting of ASB.
Regarding limitations of our analysis, most of the included 
studies were performed in inpatient populations in North 
America and Europe, and thus may not be applicable to other 
patient populations. Moreover, we were not able to estimate 
the effect of age on the treatment rates due to lack of uniform-
ity in the reporting of relevant information. In addition, we 
were unable to perform a separate analysis of patients with 
spinal cord injury due to the paucity of relevant data. Future 
studies should investigate this question as it has been suggested 
that the IDSA guidelines [8] may not be widely implemented 
among patients with spinal cord injury [52] due to limited 
relevant evidence and the inherent diagnostic challenges 
presented by this patient group [52]. Furthermore, given the 
small number of studies reporting on factors associated with 
overtreatment, we were unable to perform a multivariate anal-
ysis to assess for possible confounders. It should also be noted 
that the reported lack of an association between the site of 
patient hospitalization (surgical floor, ICU) or the presence 
of diabetes and the rate of ASB overtreatment was based on 
a limited patient sample and may merely stem from reduced 
statistical power. Future studies are needed to confirm these 
findings. Regarding the estimation of the effect of interven-
tions, we performed a descriptive analysis instead of pooling 
the effects due to the disparity between strategies applied by 
different institutions.
In conclusion, the present study highlights the considera-
ble gap between evidence-based guidelines and contemporary 
clinical practice in the management of ASB. Undue emphasis 
on laboratory results, rather than on the patient’s clinical con-
dition, appears to underlie most cases of ASB overtreatment. 
Evidence suggests that the challenges of differentiating symp-
tomatic from asymptomatic bacteriuria and improving adher-
ence to evidence-based guidelines can be overcome through a 
combination of educational and organizational interventions 
and that ASB should be a priority for antimicrobial stewardship 
programs.
