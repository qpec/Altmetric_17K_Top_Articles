July–December 2016

On October 27, 2017, this report was posted as an MMWR 
Early Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
Preliminary estimates of U.S. drug overdose deaths exceeded 
60,000 in 2016 and were partially driven by a fivefold increase 
in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids (excluding 
methadone), from 3,105 in 2013 to approximately 20,000 
in 2016 (1,2). Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic 
opioid 50–100 times more potent than morphine, is primarily 
responsible for this rapid increase (3,4). In addition, fentanyl 
analogs such as acetylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, and carfentanil 
are being detected increasingly in overdose deaths (5,6) and 
the illicit opioid drug supply (7). Carfentanil is estimated to 
be 10,000 times more potent than morphine (8). Estimates 
of the potency of acetylfentanyl and furanylfentanyl vary but 
suggest that they are less potent than fentanyl (9). Estimates of 
relative potency have some uncertainty because illicit fentanyl 
analog potency has not been evaluated in humans. This report 
describes opioid overdose deaths during July–December 2016 
that tested positive for fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, or U-47700, 
an illicit synthetic opioid, in 10 states participating in CDC’s 
Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance (ESOOS) 
program.* Fentanyl analogs are similar in chemical structure 
to fentanyl but not routinely detected because specialized 
toxicology testing is required. Fentanyl was detected in at 
least half of opioid overdose deaths in seven of 10 states, and 
57% of fentanyl-involved deaths also tested positive for other 
illicit drugs, such as heroin. Fentanyl analogs were present in 
>10% of opioid overdose deaths in four states, with carfentanil, 
furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl identified most frequently. 
Expanded surveillance for opioid overdoses, including testing 
for fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, assists in tracking the rap-
idly changing illicit opioid market and informing innovative 
interventions designed to reduce opioid overdose deaths.
The 10 states† reporting data abstracted information from 
preliminary death certificates and medical examiner/coroner 
reports on unintentional and undetermined opioid overdose 
* CDC’s Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance program funded 12 states 
through a competitive application process in fiscal year 2016. Data were available 
for this report for 10 of the 12 states. https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/foa/

deaths using standard definitions for variables. Data were 
entered into the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting 
System (SUDORS), the component of ESOOS designed for 
tracking fatal opioid overdoses.§ For each death, available data 
on demographic characteristics, circumstances of the overdose 
collected from death scene investigations (e.g., evidence of 
illicit drug use), and results of forensic toxicology testing were 
entered into SUDORS. Opioid overdose deaths occurring dur-
ing July–December 2016 with positive test results for fentanyl, 
fentanyl analogs, and U-47700 in 10 states are described, 
and key demographic and overdose circumstance factors are 
stratified by substance. Full toxicology findings of decedents 
were reviewed, including the presence of heroin, cocaine, and 
methamphetamine. Because heroin involvement in overdose 
deaths is difficult to distinguish from prescription morphine, 
deaths in which heroin was confirmed by toxicologic findings 
were combined with deaths in which heroin was suspected 
because morphine was detected and death scene evidence 
suggested heroin use.¶ The use of medical examiner/coroner 
reports, previously unavailable across states, provides unique 
insights into specific substances and circumstances associated 
with overdoses, which can inform interventions.
Fentanyl was detected in 56.3% of 5,152 opioid overdose 
deaths in the 10 states during July–December 2016 (Figure). 
Among these 2,903 fentanyl-positive deaths, fentanyl was 
determined to be a cause of death by the medical examiner or 
§ State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) estimates 
of opioid-involved overdose deaths might differ from those of the National 
Vital Statistics System because SUDORS uses preliminary death certificate data 
and collects additional information from medical examiner and coroner reports, 
which are abstracted within 8 months of death. In SUDORS, an opioid-involved 
overdose death either was identified through review of the medical examiner/
coroner report or had International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision 
(ICD-10) underlying cause-of-death codes X40–44 (unintentional) or Y10–Y14 
(undetermined) and multiple cause-of-death codes T40.0, T40.1, T40.2, T40.3, 
T40.4, or T40.6 on the death certificate. Data for this report were downloaded 
on September 5, 2017.
¶ A confirmed heroin death is defined as a death that tested positive for the heroin 
metabolite 6-acetylmorphine. The heroin metabolite 6-acetylmorphine, 
however, rapidly metabolizes to morphine, and thus a death involving heroin 
might only test positive for morphine, which is also present in deaths involving 
prescription morphine. A suspected heroin death is one in which testing for 
morphine is positive and the decedent also has a history of heroin use or death 
scene evidence indicating illicit drug use or injection in the absence of any 
evidence of prescription drug use or use of prescription morphine. https://www.

coroner in nearly all (97.1%) of the deaths. Northeastern states 
(Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island) 
and Missouri** reported the highest percentages of opioid 
overdose deaths involving fentanyl (approximately 60%–90%), 
followed by Midwestern and Southern states (Ohio, West 
Virginia, and Wisconsin), where approximately 30%–55% 
of decedents tested positive for fentanyl. New Mexico and 
Oklahoma reported the lowest percentage of fentanyl-involved 
deaths (approximately 15%–25%). In contrast, states detecting 
any fentanyl analogs in >10% of opioid overdose deaths were 
spread across the Northeast (Maine, 28.6%, New Hampshire, 
12.2%), Midwest (Ohio, 26.0%), and South (West Virginia, 
20.1%) (Figure) (Table 1).
Fentanyl analogs were present in 720 (14.0%) opioid over-
dose deaths, with the most common being carfentanil (389 
deaths, 7.6%), furanylfentanyl (182, 3.5%), and acetylfen-
tanyl (147, 2.9%) (Table 1). Fentanyl analogs contributed to 
death in 535 of the 573 (93.4%) decedents. Cause of death 
was not available for fentanyl analogs in 147 deaths.†† Five 
or more deaths involving carfentanil occurred in two states 
(Ohio and West Virginia), furanylfentanyl in five states 
(Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio, West Virginia, and Wisconsin), 
and acetylfentanyl in seven states (Maine, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin). U-47700 was present in 0.8% of deaths and 
found in five or more deaths only in Ohio, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin (Table 1). Demographic characteristics of decedents 
were similar among overdose deaths involving fentanyl analogs 
and fentanyl (Table 2). Most were male (71.7% fentanyl and 
72.2% fentanyl analogs), non-Hispanic white (81.3% fentanyl 
and 83.6% fentanyl analogs), and aged 25–44 years (58.4% 
fentanyl and 60.0% fentanyl analogs) (Table 2).
Other illicit drugs co-occurred in 57.0% and 51.3% of 
deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, respectively, 
with cocaine and confirmed or suspected heroin detected in a 
substantial percentage of deaths (Table 2). Nearly half (45.8%) 
of deaths involving fentanyl analogs tested positive for two or 
more analogs or fentanyl, or both. Specifically, 30.9%, 51.1%, 
and 97.3% of deaths involving carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, 
and acetylfentanyl, respectively, tested positive for fentanyl 
or additional fentanyl analogs. Forensic investigations found 
evidence of injection drug use in 46.8% and 42.1% of overdose 
deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, respectively. 
Approximately one in five deaths involving fentanyl and fen-
tanyl analogs had no evidence of injection drug use but did 
have evidence of other routes of administration. Among these 
deaths, snorting (52.4% fentanyl and 68.8% fentanyl analogs) 
and ingestion (38.2% fentanyl and 29.7% fentanyl analogs) 
were most common. Although rare, transdermal administra-
tion was found among deaths involving fentanyl (1.2%), likely 
indicating pharmaceutical fentanyl (Table 2). More than one 
third of deaths had no evidence of route of administration.
 
** Illicitly manufactured fentanyl is more easily mixed with white powder heroin, 
which is primarily sold east of the Mississippi River, than with black tar 
heroin. Although white powder heroin dominates the heroin market in the 
Northeast, the heroin market in Missouri includes both white powder heroin 
and black tar heroin. This might, in part, explain the high percentage of 
fentanyl overdoses documented in the state. Additional information available 
at https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/dmas/Midwest_DMA-2011(U).pdf.
 
†† Data on whether fentanyl analogs contributed to the death in which they were 
detected was not available for 20.4% of deaths with fentanyl analogs. As new 
fentanyl analogs emerged, they were captured as free text (without the option 
to indicate whether they contributed to the death) until being added to the 
menu of substances in the toxicology portion of SUDORS.

alfentanil, and sufentanil; none of the SUDORS deaths was positive for these 
substances. Carfentanil is used exclusively in large animal veterinary medicine.

Discussion
This analysis of opioid overdose deaths in 10 states partici-
pating in the ESOOS program found that illicitly manufac-
tured fentanyl is a key factor driving opioid overdose deaths 
and that fentanyl analogs are increasingly contributing to a 
complex illicit opioid market with significant public health 
implications. Previous reports have indicated that use of illicitly 
manufactured fentanyl mixed with heroin, with and without 
users’ knowledge, is driving many fentanyl overdoses, particu-
larly east of the Mississippi River (3,4). Consistent with these 
findings, at least half of opioid overdose deaths in six of the 
seven participating states east of the Mississippi tested positive 
for fentanyl. Over half the overdose deaths involving fentanyl 
and fentanyl analogs tested positive for confirmed or sus-
pected heroin (the most commonly detected illicit substance), 
cocaine, or methamphetamine. This supports findings from 
other reports indicating that fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are 
commonly used with or mixed with heroin or cocaine (3,4). 
Nearly half of overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl 
analogs, however, did not test positive for other illicit opioids, 
suggesting that fentanyl and fentanyl analogs might be emerg-
ing as unique illicit products.
Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are highly potent and fast-acting 
synthetic compounds that can trigger rapid progression to loss 
of consciousness and death and thus might require immediate 
treatment and high doses of naloxone (5). Because of the potency 
of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs and the rapid onset of action, 
these drugs were determined by medical examiners and coroners 
to play a causal role in almost all fatal opioid overdoses in which 
they were detected. Injection, the most commonly reported 
route of administration in fatal overdoses, exacerbates these risks 
because of rapid absorption and high bioavailability. The high 
potency of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, however, can result 
in overdose even when administered via other routes. Nearly 
one in five deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs had 
evidence of snorting, ingestion, or smoking, with no evidence of 
injection. Multiple overdose outbreaks and law enforcement drug 
product submissions across the country have reported counterfeit 
prescription pills laced with fentanyl and fentanyl analogs (10).
With few exceptions, fentanyl analogs are illicitly manufac-
tured, because they do not have a legitimate medical use in 
humans.§§ The detection of fentanyl analogs in >10% of opioid 
overdoses in four states raises the concern that fentanyl analogs 
have become a part of illicit opioid markets in multiple states. 
The fentanyl analogs most commonly detected were carfent-
anil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl. Carfentanil, which 
is intended for sedation of large animals, is much more potent 
than fentanyl, whereas furanylfentanyl and acetylfentanyl are 
less potent (9). Carfentanil contributed to approximately 
350 overdose deaths in Ohio, but was detected in only one 
other state (West Virginia). Because of its extreme potency, 
even limited circulation of carfentanil could markedly increase 
the number of fatal overdoses. Recent data suggest that carfen-
tanil deaths are occurring in multiple other states, including 
Kentucky, which reported 10 overdose deaths involving carfen-
tanil in the second half of 2016 (Kentucky Department of 
Public Health, unpublished data, 2017) and New Hampshire, 
which reported 10 deaths in 2017.¶¶ Forty-six percent of

SUDORS opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl analogs 
tested positive for fentanyl or an additional fentanyl analog, 
ranging from 31% for carfentanil to 97% for acetylfentanyl. 
The increased mixing or co-use of fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, 
and varying fentanyl analogs might contribute to increased risk 
for overdose because persons misusing opioids and other drugs 
are exposed to drug products with substantially varied potency.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, results are limited to 10 states and therefore might 
not be generalizable. Second, the presence of fentanyl analogs is 
underestimated because commonly used toxicologic testing does 
not include fentanyl analogs, some fentanyl analogs are difficult to 
detect (9), and specialized testing for fentanyl analogs varied across 
states and over time. Third, the route of fentanyl and fentanyl 
analog administration must be interpreted cautiously because the 
data do not link specific drugs to routes of administration and 
thus the precise route of administration of fentanyl or fentanyl 
analogs cannot be determined in overdose deaths involving 
multiple substances (e.g., heroin and cocaine) and routes (e.g., 
injection and snorting). Fourth, the combination of deaths with 
toxicologic confirmation of heroin with those with detection of 
morphine and death scene evidence suggesting heroin use might 
have resulted in misclassification of some deaths. Finally, fentanyl 
source could not be definitively determined; however, only a 
small percentage of fentanyl deaths had evidence consistent with 
prescription fentanyl (e.g., transdermal use versus injection).
Illicitly manufactured fentanyl is now a major driver of 
opioid overdose deaths in multiple states, with a variety of 
fentanyl analogs increasingly involved, if not solely implicated, 
in these deaths. This finding raises concern that in the near 
future, fentanyl analog overdose deaths might mirror the rap-
idly rising trajectory of fentanyl overdose deaths that began in 
2013 and become a major factor in opioid overdose deaths. In 
response to this concern, CDC expanded ESOOS to 32 states 
and the District of Columbia in 2017 and added funding for 
all 33 recipients to improve forensic toxicologic testing of 
opioid overdose deaths to include capacity to test for a wider 
range of fentanyl analogs.*** Increased implementation of 
evidence-based efforts targeting persons at high risk for illicit 
opioid use, including increased access to medication-assisted 
treatment, increased availability of naloxone in sufficient doses, 
and other innovative intervention programs targeting this 
group, is needed to address a large and growing percentage of 
opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Sharp increases in opioid overdose deaths since 2013 are partly 
explained by the introduction of illicitly manufactured fentanyl 
into the heroin market. Outbreaks related to fentanyl analogs 
also have occurred. One fentanyl analog, carfentanil, is esti-
mated to be 10,000 times more potent than morphine. Fentanyl 
analogs are not routinely detected because specialized 
toxicology testing is required.
What is added by this report?
This is the first report using toxicologic and death scene 
evidence across multiple states to characterize opioid overdose 
deaths. Fentanyl was involved in >50% of opioid overdose 
deaths, and >50% of deaths testing positive for fentanyl and 
fentanyl analogs also tested positive for other illicit drugs. 
Approximately 700 deaths tested positive for fentanyl analogs, 
with the most common being carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, 
and acetylfentanyl. 
What are the implications for public health practice?
Increasing mixing or co-use of fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and 
fentanyl analogs might contribute to increased overdose risk, 
because users are exposed to drug products that vary substan-
tially in potency and that include some extremely potent 
products. Surveillance for opioid overdoses needs to expand to 
track the rapidly changing illicit opioid market. In fall 2017, CDC 
funded 33 jurisdictions to expand forensic toxicology testing. 
Increased implementation of evidence-based efforts targeting 
persons at high risk for using illicit opioids, including increased 
access to medication-assisted treatment and increased availabil-
ity of naloxone, and innovative interventions are needed.
