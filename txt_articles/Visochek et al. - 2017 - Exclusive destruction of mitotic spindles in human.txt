ABSTRACT
We identified target proteins modified by phenanthrenes that cause exclusive 
eradication of human cancer cells. The cytotoxic activity of the phenanthrenes in a 
variety of human cancer cells is attributed by these findings to post translational 
modifications of NuMA and kinesins HSET/kifC1 and kif18A. Their activity prevented 
the binding of NuMA to α-tubulin and kinesins in human cancer cells, and caused 
aberrant spindles. The most efficient cytotoxic activity of the phenanthridine PJ34, 
caused significantly smaller aberrant spindles with disrupted spindle poles and 
scattered extra-centrosomes and chromosomes. Concomitantly, PJ34 induced tumor 
growth arrest of human malignant tumors developed in athymic nude mice, indicating 
the relevance of its activity for cancer therapy. 
INTRODUCTION
Small molecules acting as PARP1 inhibitors are 
tested in the clinic for their possible potency to promote 
cell eradication after irradiation or DNA damaging 
chemotherapy [1, 2]. The idea underlying their use for 
cancer therapy is based on the role of activated PARP1 
in DNA breaks repair [3]. PARP1 activity is inhibited by 
molecules mimicking the binding of its substrate, NAD 
(nicotine amide-di-nucleotide) to the catalytic site [3, 4]. 
Interestingly, our recent studies disclosed a group of small 
phenanthrene molecules that exclusively eradicate human 
cancer cells. Despite acting as PARP1 inhibitors, their 
cytotoxic effect is not attributed to their PARP1 inhibition 
potency [6–8]. These small molecules exclusively 
eradicate human cancer cells during mitosis without 
impairing normal proliferating cells [6–8]. They share 
this activity with other phenanthrenes [9], but not with 
non-phenanthrene potent PARP1 inhibitors [1–3, 7–8]. 
 
Here, we identified target proteins modified by these 
phenanthrenes, which include the derivatives PJ34, Phen 
and Tiq-A [7]. As other PARP1 inhibitors, PJ34, Phen and 
Tiq-A rescue normal quiescent cells from cell-death under 
stress conditions (e.g. ischemia, or inflammation [4, 10]). 
However, in human cancer cells they cause an opposite 
effect, exclusively causing cell death during mitosis [6–9]. 
We found that PJ34, Phen and Tiq-A modify 
kinesins (HSET/kifC1 and kif18A) and NuMA (nuclear 
mitotic apparatus protein) in a variety of human cancer 
cells. As a result, NuMA binding to the kinesins and to 
α-tubulin (a main component in the microtubules) was 
abolished. Most significantly, spindles, spindle poles, bi-
focal centrosomes clustering and chromosomes assembly 
and alignment in the spindle mid-zone were disrupted. 
Recent studies indicated that NuMA transfer along 
the microtubules, and the activity of kinesins HSET/
kifC1 and kif18A are necessary for spindle constraction 
in mitosis. The kinesin HSET/kifC1 (microtubules 
minus end-directed motor protein) sorts microtubules 
into bundles that construct the spindle. Its indispensable 
activity for spindle construction in human malignant 
cells has been reported [16–22]. The kinesin Kif18A 
moves towards the microtubule plus end [20, 22, 23]. 
Kif18A is apparently implicated in microtubules

de-polymerization, necessary for chromosomes assembly 
in the spindle mid-zone. Loss of its function results 
in the formation of long microtubules and scattered 
chromosomes [23]. 
The non-motor protein NuMA has a microtubules-
binding capacity, which is implicated in the formation 
of microtubule bundles, and in converging and tethering 
spindle microtubules ends to create stable spindle poles 
[11–13]. Its capacity to bind proteins proved necessary 
for its activity [11, 12, 14]. NuMA forms filamentous 
polymers, which are useful in transferring NuMA 
along the microtubules in both malignant and normal 
proliferating cells [12]. Its activity is controlled by 
phosphorylation (including phosphorylation by Pim1) and 
polyADP-ribosylation [13, 14]. PolyADP-ribosylation of 
NuMA by activated tankyrase1, which exists in malignant 
cells but hardly exists in normal somatic cells, facilitates 
its binding to proteins [14], including those anchored to 
the spindle poles [15]. In addition, NuMA transfer towards 
the spindle poles has been associated with its binding 
to the microtubules minus end-directed motor protein, 
dyneine [11–13]. 
We found that the phenanthrenes, PJ34, Phen and 
Tiq-A, prevent the post-translational modifications of 
NuMA, HSET/kifC1 and Kif18A exclusively in human 
cancer cells. Their activity impaired the binding of NuMA 
to the kinesins and to α-tubulin, a component in the 
microtubules (microtubules are polymers consisting of 
α-, β-tubulin heterodimers [24]). Concomitantly, spindles 
and spindle poles were disrupted, extra centrosomes in 
multi-centrosomal cancer cells were not clustered, and 
chromosomes were not aligned in the spindle mid-zone. 
These impairments that cause cell death during mitosis 
 
[6–8, 25], may underlie tumor growth arrest of human 
cancer tumors treated with PJ34. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Our 
search 
for 
proteins 
affected 
by 
the 
phenanthrenes PJ34, Tiq-A and Phen identified proteins 
implicated in mitosis. PJ34, Tiq-A and Phen affected the 
post translational modification of these target proteins, 
as indicated by the shift in their isoelectric points (pI). 
Changes in the pI of proteins indicate their covalent 
modifications [26]. Previously, we used this marker 
to identify activation of G-proteins and polyADP-
ribosylation of nuclear proteins [27, 28].
The phenanthrenes PJ34, Tiq-A and Phen shifted the 
pI of their target proteins towards higher pH values (less 
negatively charged protein) in a variety of human cancer 
cells, but not in normal proliferating cells. In cancer cells 
treated with the phenanthrenes (27 h incubation, 24 h after 
seeding), the shift in pI indicated an induced inhibition 
of their negatively charging covalent modifications (e.g., 
phosphorylation, ADP- and polyADP-ribosylation) 
(Figure 1). 
Similar pI values of kinesins HSET/kifC1 
and kif18A and the non-motor protein NuMA were 
measured in untreated normal and malignant cells. The 
phenanthrenes did not alter the pI of HSET/kifC1 and 
kif18A in normal epithelial cells MCF10A. NuMA was 
even more negatively charged in these proliferating cells 
after treatment (Figure 1D). However, in a variety of 
cancer cells, PJ34, Phen and Tiq-A prevented or attenuated 
the modifications of NuMA and kinesins HSET/kifC1 
and kif18A (Figure 1A, 1C, 1E). Notably, the pI of 
these proteins was not affected by non-phenanthrenes 
acting as potent PARP1 inhibitors (e.g., ABT888), 
excluding possible implication of PARP1 inhibition in the 
modification of NuMA and kinesins by the phenanthrenes.
In addition, the phenanthrenes did not affect 
the pI of α-tubulin neither in malignant nor in benign 
proliferating human cells (Figure 1B). 
In view of the identified differences between 
human cancer and normal cells regarding NuMA and 
kinesins modification by the phenanthrenes, and in view 
of the major role of these proteins in mitosis [11, 16], we 
characterized the effects of the most potent phenanthrene 
PJ34 on mitosis of malignant versus benign cells.
Previous findings indicate the essential role of 
HSET/kifC1 in the spindle structure in human cancer cells 
[17–19, 21, 22]. HSET/kifC1 inhibition or silencing cause 
small aberrant spindles in human malignant cells [18, 19].
Similarly, smaller spindles were identified by 
confocal imaging in human malignant cells treated with 
PJ34 (20 µM, 27 h incubation), in comparison to the 
spindle size of untreated cells (60%  ± 5% in size, in 95% 
of the 20 scanned spindles; Figure 2A). Immunolabeling 
of microtubules by α-tubulin or by HSET/kifC1 bound to 
the microtubules [17, 19–21] disclosed poorly constructed 
bundles and disorganized spindles in PJ34 treated cancer 
cells (90% of the 20 scanned spindles) (Figures 2 and 3). 
 
Treatment with PJ34 also disrupted the spindle poles 
(Figure 2B). Bi-focal spindles with clustered extra-
centrosomes were not detected in the multi-centrosomal 
cells MDA-MB-231 [7, 8] (Figure 3A). PJ34 also altered 
NuMA localization, and the alignment of chromosomes 
in the spindle mid-zone (Figures 3 and Supplementary 
Figure 1). In PJ34 treated cancer cells chromosomes were 
scattered outside the spindle and close to the spindle poles 
(Figures 2B, 3A and 3C). 
In contrast, PJ34 did not impair neither spindles and 
spindle poles, nor the bipolar localization of NuMA and 
the alignment of chromosomes in normal human epithelial 
cells MCF10A (n = 20; Figures 2 and 3). 
Previous findings indicate a major contribution 
of both HSET/kifC1 and NuMA to the spindle poles 
structure [11, 16–18]. A major role of NuMA binding to 
microtubules, and its transfer along the microtubules to the 
spindle poles has been suggested to be crucial for the poles 
structure and stability [11–13, 29]. Furthermore, poles 
stability is required for proper alignment of chromosomes

human cells treated with phenanthrenes. (A) The isoelectric point of kinesins HSET/kifC1 and kif18A in human triple negative 
breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 was shifted towards higher pH values (less negatively charged protein) after 27 hours incubation with 
the phenanthrene derivatives PJ34 (20 µM), Tiq-A (50 µM) or Phen (50 µM). No similar effect was induced by the non-phenanthrene 
PARP1 inhibitor ABT888 (20 µM). (B) The isoelectric point of α-tubulin was not affected by the phenanthrenes or by ABT888 in MDA-
MB-231 cells. (C) The isoelectric point of kinesins HSET/kifC1 and kif18A was shifted towards higher pH values (less negatively charged 
protein) in human lung (A549), pancreas (PANC1) and glioblastoma (U87) cancer cells incubated for 27 h with PJ34 (20 µM), Tiq-A 
(50 µM) or Phen (50 µM). No similar effect on their isoelectric point was induced by the non-phenanthrene PARP1 inhibitor ABT888 
(20 µM). (D) Treatment with the phenanthridine PJ34 (20 µM, 27 h) did not affect the isoelecrtic point of α-tubulin and kinesins HSET/
kifC1 and Kif18A in human normal breast epithelial cells MCF10A. The isoelectric point of NuMA was shifted towards lower pH (more 
negatively charged protein) in these cells. (E) Treatment with PJ34 (20 µM, 27 h) shifted the isoelectric point of NuMA towards higher pH 
values (less negatively charged protein) in human malignant cells, including: breast (MDA-MB-231), lung (A549), pancreas (PANC1) and 
glioblastoma (U87) cells. Representative results of 4 different experiments in each cell type are displayed in A–E.

in the spindle mid-zone [29, 30]. In accordance, mutations 
in NuMA preventing its binding to microtubules, or a 
transient silencing of NuMA caused impaired spindle 
poles, un-segregated misaligned chromosomes and mitosis 
arrest [13, 30].
In view of these results, a possible effect of the 
phenanthridine PJ34 on the binding of NuMA to kinesins 
and microtubules was examined in human cancer versus 
normal proliferating cells. Protein-to protein binding was 
tested by co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 4). 
We found that the binding of NuMA to α-tubulin 
and to the kinesins HSET/kifC1 and kif18A was 
prevented in cancer cells treated with PJ34 (Figure 4A, 
4C and Supplementary Figure 2). No similar effect on 
their binding was identified in normal epithelial cells 
(Figure 4B and 4C). In addition, PJ34 did not affect 
the binding of HSET/kifC1 and kif18A to α-tubulin 
in both cancer and normal cells (Figures 4, A and B). 
This may reflect the binding of NuMA and kinesins to 
α-tubulin in the microtubules. PJ34 apparently prevents 
the binding of NuMA to microtubules and to kinesins 
HSET/kifC1 and kif18A, while HSET/kifC1 and kif18A 
binding to the microtubules is not affected. Changes in 
the kinesins movement along the microtubules were not 
excluded (Figure 4A). In addition, PJ34 did not interfere 
with kif18A binding to the motor protein CENP-E, a 
plus end-directed motor protein, functioning together 
with kif18A in kinetochore-microtubule capture during 
chromosome alignment in the spindle mid-zone [31] 
(Figure 4A).

Since polyADP-ribosylation facilitates the binding 
of NuMA to proteins [14], prevention of NuMA binding 
to α-tubulin and kinesins in human cancer cells treated 
with PJ34 (Figures 4A), could be partially attributed to 
inhibition of tankyrase1 by the phenanthrenes PJ34, Phen 
and Tiq-A [14, 32, 33]. Their activity is not shared by 
non-phenanthrenes acting as potent PARP1 inhibitors 
[32, 33]. PJ34 (but not the non-phenanthrene potent 
PARP1 inhibitor ABT888) prevented the post-translational 
modification of tankyrase1 (apparently by polyADP-
ribosylation, Figure 5A and 5C), without impairing the 
binding of tankyrase1 to its substrate NuMA (Figure 5B 
and 5C). NuMA co-immunoprecipitated with tankyrase1, 
either polyADP-ribosylated or not (Figure 5B and 5C). 
Also, the polyADP-ribosylation of NuMA was inhibited 
by PJ34 along with tankyrase1 inhibition. NuMA was

not [32P]polyADP-ribosylated in cells treated with PJ34 
(20 µM) (Figure 5C). No similar effect of PJ34 on NuMA 
binding to α-tubulin and kinesins due to tankyrase1 
inhibition is expected in normal epithelial cells where 
tankyrase1 hardly exists [14, 15]. 
However, NuMA modification by PJ34 is not 
attributed to its polyADP-ribosylation alone. In cancer 
cells, NuMA was similarly modified in the absence of 
phosphatase inhibitors (Figure 6), suggesting a possible 
role of kinase inhibition in the modification of NuMA by 
the phenanthrenes PJ34, Phen and TiqA (Figures 1E, 6). 
 
Also, phosphatase activity altered isoelectric points 
of kinesins HSET/kifC1 and kif18A similarly to their 
alteration by phenanthrenes (Figurers 1A, 1C and 6). 
Evidence indicating the control of their activity by 
phosphorylation [13, 16, 20, 22] support this notion. 
Although specific kinases inhibited by PJ34 were not 
identified, PJ34-induced inhibition of Pim1 could be 
one of the possible mechanisms implicated in NuMA 
modification by PJ34. The serine/threonine kinase Pim1 
is highly expressed in cancer cells, it targets NuMA, and it 
is inhibited by PJ34 at the concentration range modifying 
NuMA in cancer cells [13, 34–36]. 
In cancer cells, tankyrase1, NuMA and HSET/
kifC1 are localized in the spindle poles [15, 17–19], and 
tankyrase1 polyADP-ribosylation contributes to spindle 
poles stability [14, 15], possibly by inducing NuMA 
polyADP-ribosylation [14]. PJ34, inhibiting tankyrase1 
polyADP-ribosylation ([32, 33]; Figure 5), interfered 
with the binding of tankyrase1 and NuMA to HSET/kifC1 
in cancer cells (Figures 4A and 5B). On the other hand, 
tankyrase1, either polyADP-ribosylated or not, was bound 
to γ-tubulin, which is ubiquitous in the pericentriolar 
material [37, 38]. Thus, binding of tankyrase1 to 
centrosomes even outside the spindle poles is anticipated. 
Due to the tendency of un-polyADP-ribosylated 
tankyrase1 to form two-dimensional polymers that anchor 
proteins [15], and its tendency to bind γ-tubulin (Figure 5B), 
 
a possible anchorage of centrosomes to tankyrase 
polymers outside the spindle poles could promote extra-

measured by its shifted pI. Treatment with PJ34 (20 µM, 27 h) attenuated the shift in the isoelectric point of negatively charged tankyrase1 
in lung cancer (A549), triple negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and glioblastoma (U87) cancer cells. No similar shift of the isoelectric 
point of tankyrase1 was induced by the non-phenanthrene PARP1 inhibitor ABT888 (20 µM, 27 h). PolyADP-ribosylated PARP1 was 
similarly suppressed by both PARP1 inhibitors, PJ34 (20 µM) and ABT888 (20 µM). Representative results of 3 experiments in each cell 
type are displayed. (B) The binding of tankyrase1 to γ-tubulin or NuMA was measured by co-immunoprecipitation. Their binding in MDA-
MB-231 cells was not affected by treatment with PJ34 (20 µM, 27 h). The binding of tankyrase1 to kinesin HSET/kifC1 was impaired. 
Representative results of 3 experiments are displayed. (C) [32P]polyADP-ribosylation of NuMA bound to tankyrase1 was inhibited after 
treatment of human cancer cells MDA-MB-231 with PJ34 (20 µM, 30 min). Binding of NuMA to tankyrase1 was measured by dot 
blot analysis (Methods). [32P]polyADP-ribosylated NuMA bound to tankyrase1 was trapped by tankyrase1 antibody on nitrocellulose 
membrane, auto-radiographed and immunolabeled. Results were repeated in 3 different experiments.

centrosomes de-clustering in multi-centrosomal cancer 
cells with disrupted spindle poles (Figure 2B). Thus, 
inhibition of tankyrase1 polyADP-ribosylation by PJ34, 
Phen or Tiq-A [32, 33] could both disrupt spindle poles 
(Figures 2B) and promote centrosomes de-clustering due 
to their binding to scattered tankyrase1 polymers ([15], 
Figures 5 and 7). 
Bi-focal convergence points of tankyrase1 co-
localized with γ-tubulin and pericentrin were identified 
by confocal scanning microscopy in the spindle poles of 
multi-centrosomal human cancer cells (Figure 7A and 7B). 
However, this bi-focal co-localization of tankyrase1 with 
both γ-tubulin and pericentrin was prevented by treatment 
with PJ34. Instead, tankyrase1 co-localized with both 
γ-tubulin and pericentrin in scattered clusters in 95% of 
the PJ34 treated cells (Figure 7A and 7B). Notably, the 
potent PARP1 inhibitor ABT888, which does not inhibit 
tankyrase1 ( [32]; Figure 5A), and did not affect the pI of 
NuMA in cancer cells (Figure 1E) - did not interfere with 
the bi-focal co-localization of tankyrase1 with γ-tubulin 
and pericentrin in the spindle poles (Figure 7A and 7B). 
These results are in accordance with previously reported 
no-interference of ABT888 with extra-centrosomes bi-focal 
clustering in multi-centrosomal cancer cells [7, 8], and they 
support a PARP1-independent activity of the phenanthrenes 
in extra-centrosomes de-clustering (Figures 1, 5A).
Stable spindle poles are required for normal 
alignment of chromosomes in the spindle mid-zone [29, 30]. 
A normal transfer of NuMA along the spindle microtubules 
towards the spindle poles is required for their construction 
and stability (11–14). Thus, an impaired binding of NuMA 
to α-tubulin and kinesins HSET/kifC1 and kif18A in cancer 
cells treated with PJ34 (Figure 4A and 4C) could impair 
the formation of stable spindle poles [11, 17, 21], and the 
alignment of chromosomes in the spindle mid-zone [29, 30]. 
 
This was assessed by confocal imaging of PJ34 treated 
cancer cells (Figures 2, 3, 7). Chromosomes alignment 
in the mid-zone was impaired in abnormal spindles with 
Figure 6: Phosphatase activity changes the isoelectric points of NuMA and kinesins HSET/kifC1 and kif18A in human 
breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. In the absence of phosphatase inhibition enhancing kinase activity, some of the isoelectric points 
of NuMA and kinesins HSET/kifC1 and kif18A were shifted towards higher pH values (less negatively charged protein). Similar results 
were obtained in 3 different experiments.

tankyrase1 (green), γ-tubulin (red) and pericentrin (red). Chromosomes are stained by DAPI (blue). After incubation with PJ34 (20 µM, 
27 h), the bipolar co-localization of tankyrase1 and γ-tubulin (A) or tankyrase1 and pericentrin (B) turned into multiple scattered foci of the 
co-localized proteins. Chromosomes were not aligned in the spindle mid-zone in all the PJ34 treated cells. Treatment with ABT888 (n = 20; 
20 µM, 27 h) did not impair the bipolar co-localization of tankyrase1 and γ-tubulin (A), or tankyrase and pericentrin (B), nor impaired the 
chromosomes alignment in the spindle mid-zone in MDA-MB-231 cells. Co-localization of tankyrase1 and pericentrin, or tankyrase1 and 
γ-tubulin was detected in 95% of the randomly scanned spindles of both treated and untreated cells (n = 20).

disorganized spindle poles in cancer cells treated with 
PJ34 [18, 21, 29, 30]. Misaligned chromosomes cause 
mitotic cell-death irrespectively of extra-centrosomes de-
clustering [6, 18, 41]. So, mitotic cell death might not be 
the consequence of un-clustered extra-centrosomes [7, 8]. 
Un-clustered centrosomes could be the consequence of 
disorganized spindle poles in multi-centrosomal cancer cells 
treated with PJ34 (Figures 2B, 3, 7). 
Notably, the impaired binding of modified NuMA 
to microtubules and to modified kinesins HSET/kifC1 
and kif18A in human cancer cells, correlated with the 
exclusive destruction of spindles and spindle poles in 
these cells. PJ34 did not interfere with the modifications 
of NuMA and kinesins in normal proliferating cells, nor 
impaired their spindles (Figures 1–4). 
Thus, 
phenanthrenes 
inhibiting 
polyADP-
ribosylation and phosphorylation of NuMA and kinesins 
HSET/kifC1 and kif18A in human cancer cells (Figures 1, 
4–6) may exclusively interfere with their activity in 
spindle construction (Figures 2, 3 and 7), and cause 
mitotic arrest and cell death [6–8, 39, 40]. A possible 
implication of such exclusive spindle destruction during 
mitosis in human cancer cells on tumor growth arrest was 
examined in human malignant tumors treated with PJ34. 
We measured the effect of PJ34 on the growth of 
rapidly developing tumors of human triple negative breast 
cancer MDA-MB-231 xenotransplants in athymic nude 
mice (Figure 8). In these experiments, mice were injected 
sub-cutaneously with 5 × 106 MDA-MB-231cells/animal. 
Localized tumors (approximately 0.1 cm3) were developed 
within 4–5 days. These tumors rapidly grew during the 
next 18 days in the group of un-treated mice (n = 5). 
In contrast, tumor growth was arrested in the group of 
mice (n = 5) treated with PJ34 (60 mg/kg, injected intra-
peritoneal, daily for 14 days) (Figure 8, Supplementary 
Figure 3). These results suggest a possible efficacy of PJ34 
treatment in cancer therapy by activation of a fast cell-
death mechanism during mitosis in cancer cells, without 
affecting normal cells. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures Human triple-negative breast cancer 
cell line MDA-MB-231 and cell-lines of glioblastoma U87, 
non-small lung cancer A549 and pancreas cancer PANC1, 
as well as human epithelial cells MCF-10A, were supplied 
by ATCC Co. (American Type Culture Collection, P.O. 
Box 1549, Manassas, VA 20108, USA. In Israel, Almog 
Diagnostic & Medical equipment Ltd). Human cancer 
cells were cultured in 6-wells multi-dish plates (Nunc 
Denmark). The human malignant cells were maintained 
in a medium containing DMEM (cat # 01-055-1A) 
 
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (cat # 04-121-1A), 1% 
L-Glutamine (cat # 03-020-1B), and 1% Pen-Strep Ampho 
(cat # 03-033-1B), purchased from biological industries, 
Israel. Human epithelial cells MCF10A were cultured in 
DMEM/F12 (Gibco, Cat No 31330) with FBS (Gibco) 
containing: 5%, EGF (100 μg/ml, Cytolab) 0.02%, 
Hydrocortisone (50 µM, Sigma) 1%, Insulin (10 mg/ml, 
Sigma) 0.1%, Pen/Strep (biological industries) 1%. 
Antibodies included antibodies directed against 
HSET/kifC1 (polyclonal rabbit Cat  12313, Cell 
Signaling  technology, or monoclonal mouse (IgG2a) Cat 
sc-100947), kif18A (polyclonal Rabbit (cat 19245-1-AP, 
ProteinTech), NuMA  (Rabbit polyclonal Cat # A301-
509A Bethyl Lab), γ-tubulin (Sigma,T5192), α-tubulin 
(Sigma, T9026 and Santa Cruz Biotech., sc-5286 lgG2b) 
and pericentrin (Abcam ab4448). Antibodies directed 
Figure 8: Human tumors growth arrested in nude athymic mice treated with PJ34. The growth of human triple negative 
breast MDA-MB-231 xenotransplants was significantly arrested in the indicated nude athymic mice injected i.p. (intraperitoneal) with PJ34 
(60 mg/kg, daily for 14 days). The significance of the change in tumor growth rate was calculated by using one-tailed t-test for estimating the 
statistical significance of the difference between the group means, without assuming equal variance. The result was statistically significant: 
p = 0.036 (t = 2.14, df = 6.33). The daily measured average tumor size in each group is presented in Supplementary Figure 3.

against tankyrase1 (Rα Tank1 762) were donated by Prof 
Susan Smith, NYU [14]. 
Treatments of cultured cells. We examined the effect of 
phenanthrenes acting also as PARP inhibitors. These included 
PJ34, (N-(6-Oxo-5,6-di hydrophenanthridin-2-yl)N,N-
dimethyl-acetamide), Tiq-A, (4H-Thieno[2,3-c] isoquinolin 
-5-one) (Sigma Israel) and Phen, (6(5H)-phenanthridinone). 
PJ34 and Phen were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals, 
(Alexis Corporation, Lausen, Switzerland). The non-
phenanthrene ABT888 (2-[R-2methylpyrrolidin-2-yl]-1H-
benzimidazole-4-carboxamide, was purchased from Abbott 
Labs, Illinois, U.S.A
Protein 
extraction 
for 
two-dimensional 
electrophoresis TNE buffer was used for cells lysis, it 
contains: 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH8.0, 20 mM 
Tris-HCl pH8.0, 1% NP-40, phosphatase inhibitors (2 mM 
sodium orthopvanadate and 25 mM β-glycerolphosphate) 
[42] and protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma) 2%. Cells 
were homogenized in the TNE buffer (about 1ml  of buffer 
to 170 mg of wet weight of cell) and incubated for 1 h on 
ice. Suspensions were pelleted at 8000 g for 15 min at 
4°C. Proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with 
methanol (added 9 volums to the sups, 30 min, RT), and 
dissolved in 9.5M Urea and 2% CHAPS.
Two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis was 
used to identify covalent post translational modifications 
of proteins that cause changes in their isoelectric point 
(pI). In the first dimension, samples (350 μg protein 
per 100 μl sample) were mounted on Immobiline 
DryStrip kit (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) 
[26], and separated by pH gradient. In the second 
dimension the mounted proteins are separated by size in 
polyacrylamide slab gels. Shifted pI of a protein towards 
lower pH indicates its enhanced negative charge (e.g., by 
phosphorylation or polyADP-ribosylation). This method 
has been used before to identify activated G-proteins and 
polyADP-ribosylated PARP1 [27, 28]. 
Co-immunoprecipitation was used to identify 
binding between proteins in whole cell protein extracts. 
We followed previously reported methods [14]. Cells 
were dissolved in TNE buffer (1 h on ice). Suspensions 
were centrifuged (8000 g for 15 min at 4°C). Proteins in 
the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation [14]. 
A specific antibody bound to protein A conjugated to 
agarose beads was used to immunoprecipitate the target 
protein. The beads with the bound proteins were discarded 
after washing in TNE buffer and boiled (1 min) in twice 
concentrated Laemmli sample buffer. The bound proteins 
were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunolabeled.   
Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscope 
imaging. Fluorescent Immuno-labeled proteins were 
scanned by confocal microscopy in cells fixed after 
treatments, as described before [8]. Spindle filaments 
were labeled with antibodies directed against α-tubulin 
in the microtubules (monoclonal T9026; Sigma), or by 
antibodies directed against HSET/kifC1 attached to the 
filaments. Centrosomes were labeled with antibodies 
directed against γ-tubulin or pericentrin.  
Dot Blots. This method was described before [43]. 
We used this method to identify [32P]polyADP-ribosylated 
NuMA in lyzed MDA-MB-231 cells, without or after 
treatment with PJ34 ([32P]NAD (800 Ci/mmol; 1 µCi/
sample; PerkinElmer, Hod Hasharon, Israel) 
 [32P]PolyADP-ribosylated NuMA bound to 
antibody directed against tankyrase1 was anchored to 
nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked in 
‘binding buffer’ (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 
0.1% NP40, 0.5 mM PMSF, 20 mg/ml BSA) for 30 min, 
RT. After ‘blocking’ blots were incubated for 3 h at RT in 
‘binding buffer’ containing the [32P]polyADP-ribosylated 
proteins and antibody directed against tankyrase1 (Rα 
Tank1 762), and washed with TBS-Tween-20 0.1%. 
Anchored 
[32P]PolyADP-ribosylated 
NuMA 
was 
detected by autoradiography and immunolabeling of the 
nitrocellulose membranes.
In-vivo experiments: MDA-MB-231 cells were 
injected subcutaneously in Hanks’ balanced solution 
(HBSS) at concentration 5 × 106 cells/animal (50 × 106 
cells/ml; 97% viability tested by trypan blue staining) in 
ratio 2:1 mix with Matrigel™/PBS mix (1:1 ratio). PJ34 
(60 mg/kg) was injected intra-peritoneal, daily for 14 
days after tumors growth (0.1 mm3). Tumor growth was 
measured during the treatment with PJ34. The experiments 
were performed by Harlan (Envigo, Jerusalem). All 
experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care 
and Use Committees of the Ministry of Health, Israel.
