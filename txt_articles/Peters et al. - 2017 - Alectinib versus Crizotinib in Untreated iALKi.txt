BACKGROUND
Alectinib, a highly selective inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), has shown 
systemic and central nervous system (CNS) efficacy in the treatment of ALK-positive 
non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated alectinib as compared with crizo-
tinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, including 
those with asymptomatic CNS disease.
METHODS
In a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 303 patients with 
previously untreated, advanced ALK-positive NSCLC to receive either alectinib (600 mg 
twice daily) or crizotinib (250 mg twice daily). The primary end point was investigator-
assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points were independent review 
committee–assessed progression-free survival, time to CNS progression, objective re-
sponse rate, and overall survival.
RESULTS
During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an 
event of disease progression or death occurred in 62 of 152 patients (41%) in the alec-
tinib group and 102 of 151 patients (68%) in the crizotinib group. The rate of investi-
gator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly higher with alectinib than 
with crizotinib (12-month event-free survival rate, 68.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 
61.0 to 75.9] with alectinib vs. 48.7% [95% CI, 40.4 to 56.9] with crizotinib; hazard 
ratio for disease progression or death, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.65]; P<0.001); the me-
dian progression-free survival with alectinib was not reached. The results for indepen-
dent review committee–assessed progression-free survival were consistent with those 
for the primary end point. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an 
event of CNS progression, as compared with 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group 
(cause-specific hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.28; P<0.001). A response occurred 
in 126 patients in the alectinib group (response rate, 82.9%; 95% CI, 76.0 to 88.5) and 
in 114 patients in the crizotinib group (response rate, 75.5%; 95% CI, 67.8 to 82.1) 
(P 
= 
0.09). Grade 3 to 5 adverse events were less frequent with alectinib (41% vs. 50% 
with crizotinib).
CONCLUSIONS
As compared with crizotinib, alectinib showed superior efficacy and lower toxicity in 
primary treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC. (Funded by F. Hoffmann–La Roche; ALEX

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
T
he current standard first-line 
therapy for patients with advanced-stage 
non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that 
harbors rearrangement of the anaplastic lym-
phoma kinase (ALK) gene (ALK-positive NSCLC) 
is crizotinib.1 The median progression-free sur-
vival with first-line crizotinib is 10.9 months.1 
Advanced ALK-positive NSCLC is characterized 
by a high lifetime risk of central nervous system 
(CNS) metastases2 and a high frequency of brain 
metastases at diagnosis, with the CNS being the 
most common site of disease progression.3 Poten-
tial mechanisms of resistance to ALK inhibitors 
include ALK mutations and “bypass” mechanisms 
through activation of other receptor tyrosine 
kinases.4
Alectinib (CH5424602; Chugai Pharmaceutical 
and F. Hoffmann–La Roche) is a potent ALK 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a 50% maximum 
inhibitory concentration of 1.9 nmol per liter in 
enzymatic analyses and with activity against the 
effects of several ALK mutations that confer re-
sistance to crizotinib.5-9 Unlike crizotinib, alec-
tinib is a CNS penetrant; it is not a substrate of 
P-glycoprotein, a key efflux transporter located 
at the blood–brain barrier. In both preclinical 
and clinical investigations, alectinib was active 
in the CNS.10-12
The BO28984 (ALEX) trial was an interna-
tional, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial 
comparing alectinib (600 mg twice daily) with 
crizotinib in patients with previously untreated, 
advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, including those 
with asymptomatic CNS disease. Here we report 
data from the primary analysis, including the 
primary end point (investigator-assessed pro-
gression-free survival) and secondary end points.
Methods
Patients
Eligible patients had histologically or cytologi-
cally confirmed advanced NSCLC that was ALK-
positive by VENTANA ALK (D5F3) immunohisto-
chemical assay conducted at central laboratories 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Patients 
were 18 years of age or older, with an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) perfor-
mance status of 0 to 2 (on a 5-point scale, with 
higher numbers reflecting greater disability), no 
previous systemic treatment for advanced NSCLC, 
measurable disease (according to Response Eval-
uation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 
1.1), and adequate hepatic, renal, and bone mar-
row function (as defined in the trial protocol, 
available at NEJM.org). Patients with asymptom-
atic brain or leptomeningeal metastases were 
eligible; previous CNS radiotherapy was allowed 
if completed at least 14 days before enrollment.
Trial Oversight
The protocol was approved by the institutional 
review board or ethics committee at each par-
ticipating center and complied with Good Clin-
ical Practice guidelines, the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and local laws. All the 
patients provided written informed consent before 
enrollment. The trial was designed by the sponsor 
(F. Hoffmann–La Roche) and trial investigators 
(listed in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
sponsor collected and analyzed the data in col-
laboration with the authors, who had full access 
to all the data. The manuscript was written by 
the first two authors and the last author, with 
additional writing support (sponsor-funded) from 
Gardiner-Caldwell Communications (Macclesfield, 
United Kingdom). All the authors vouch for the 
completeness and accuracy of the data and 
analyses reported and for the adherence of the 
trial to the protocol.
Trial Design and Treatment
Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio 
by means of a block-stratified randomization 
procedure with the use of an interactive or Web-
based response system) to receive either oral 
alectinib at a dose of 600 mg twice daily (to be 
taken with food) or oral crizotinib at a dose of 
250 mg twice daily (to be taken with or without 
food). Randomization was stratified according 
to ECOG performance status (0 or 1 vs. 2), race 
(Asian vs. non-Asian), and the presence or ab-
sence of CNS metastases at baseline. Per protocol, 
crossover between trial groups was not allowed; 
patients assigned to crizotinib may have received 
alectinib after disease progression (in countries 
where alectinib was already approved or avail-
able). The primary end point was investigator-
assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end 
points were independent review committee– 
assessed progression-free survival, time to CNS 
progression, objective response rate, and overall 
survival. Other end points were the duration of 
response, rate of CNS response, duration of CNS 
response, and safety. All CNS end points were

Alectinib vs. Crizotinib in ALK-Positive Lung Cancer
assessed by the independent review committee. 
End-point definitions are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. Treatment was continued un-
til disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, 
withdrawal of consent, or death. Patients with 
isolated asymptomatic CNS progression could 
receive, at the investigator’s discretion, a local 
therapy followed by continued trial treatment 
until systemic disease progression, symptomatic 
CNS progression, or both.
Assessments
All the patients underwent tumor imaging at 
baseline, including scans of the brain. Subsequent 
tumor evaluation, including systematic brain 
imaging in all patients, was performed every 
8 weeks until disease progression. Tumor re-
sponse was assessed with the use of RECIST, 
version 1.1. Two assessments by the independent 
review committee (according to RECIST, version 
1.1) were performed, one for overall systemic 
disease and one solely for the evaluation of CNS 
end points. Details regarding the selection of 
target lesions are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix, and full details of the assessments 
are available in the protocol. Adverse events were 
graded according to the National Cancer Insti-
tute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, version 4.0, and were classified accord-
ing to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.
Statistical Analysis
Overall, 170 events of disease progression or 
death were required to achieve 80% power of the 
log-rank test to detect a target hazard ratio of 
0.65 (corresponding to an increase in median 
progression-free survival from 10.9 months with 
crizotinib to 16.8 months with alectinib) at a 
two-sided alpha level of 5%. The comparison 
between the treatment groups with respect to 
progression-free survival was based on a strati-
fied log-rank test at a 5% level of significance 
(two-sided). The Kaplan–Meier method was used 
to estimate the median progression-free survival 
for each treatment group with 95% confidence 
intervals. A stratified Cox proportional-hazards 
regression model was used to estimate the treat-
ment effect, expressed as a hazard ratio with a 
95% confidence interval.
Secondary end points were analyzed with the 
use of a hierarchical testing strategy to account 
for multiplicity. If the difference between the 
treatment groups with respect to the primary 
end point of investigator-assessed progression-free 
survival was significant, secondary end points 
were each tested (at a two-sided 5% significance 
level) in the following sequence: independent 
review committee–assessed progression-free sur-
vival, time to independent review committee–
assessed CNS progression according to RECIST 
criteria, investigator-assessed response rate, and 
overall survival.
Efficacy end points were evaluated in the inten-
tion-to-treat population, comprising all randomly 
assigned patients. The safety population included 
all the patients who received at least one dose of 
trial medication.
All the patients in the intention-to-treat pop-
ulation were included in the analysis of time to 
CNS progression, regardless of status with re-
gard to baseline CNS metastases. To account for 
the competing risks inherent in the comparison 
of CNS progression between the alectinib and 
crizotinib groups, a stratified two-sided log-
rank test was computed on the basis of a cause-
specific hazard function. The probability of CNS 
progression, non-CNS progression, and death 
were estimated with the use of cumulative-inci-
dence functions. Statistical methods are described 
further in the Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Patients
Between August 18, 2014, and January 20, 2016, 
a total of 303 patients at 98 centers underwent 
randomization. Both the intention-to-treat and 
safety populations comprised 303 patients (152 
in the alectinib group and 151 in the crizotinib 
group) (Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics were well 
balanced between the two treatment groups, 
including the presence of CNS metastases (42% 
in the alectinib group and 38% in the crizotinib 
group) (Table 1). The median duration of follow-
up was 17.6 months (range, 0.3 to 27.0) in the 
crizotinib group and 18.6 months (range, 0.5 to 
29.0) in the alectinib group. At the time of 
analysis, 68 patients (45%) had discontinued 
treatment in the alectinib group and 105 (70%) 
had discontinued treatment in the crizotinib 
group (Fig. 1).
Efficacy
At the date of primary data cutoff (February 9, 
2017), an event of disease progression or death 
had occurred in 164 patients in the intention-to-

treat population (62 of 152 patients [41%] in the 
alectinib group and 102 of 151 patients [68%] in 
the crizotinib group). The rate of investigator-
assessed progression-free survival was signifi-
cantly higher with alectinib than with crizotinib 
(12-month event-free survival rate, 68.4% [95% 
confidence interval {CI}, 61.0 to 75.9] with alec-
tinib vs. 48.7% [95% CI, 40.4 to 56.9] with crizo-
tinib; hazard ratio for disease progression or 
death, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.65]; P<0.001); the 
median progression-free survival with alectinib 
was not reached (95% CI, 17.7 months to not 
estimable), as compared with 11.1 months (95% 
CI, 9.1 to 13.1) with crizotinib (Fig. 2A). Indepen-
dent review committee–assessed progression-free 
survival was also significantly longer with alec-
tinib than with crizotinib (median progression-
free survival, 25.7 months [95% CI, 19.9 to not 
estimable] vs. 10.4 months [95% CI, 7.7 to 14.6]; 
hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 
0.50 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.70]; P<0.001) (Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The magnitude 
of the treatment effect was generally consistent 
across the subgroups (Fig. 2B). The magnitude 
of benefit was lower in the subgroups of active 
smokers and patients with an ECOG performance 
status of 2, although the numbers of patients in 
these subgroups were small.
The time to CNS progression was signifi-
cantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib in 
the intention-to-treat population (cause-specific 
hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.28; P<0.001); 
18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an 
event of CNS progression, as compared with 68 
patients (45%) in the crizotinib group (Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The cumulative 
incidence rate of CNS progression, with adjust-
ment for the competing risks of non-CNS pro-
gression and death (Fig. S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix), was consistently lower over time 
with alectinib than with crizotinib, and the 
12-month cumulative incidence rate of CNS pro-
gression was 9.4% (95% CI, 5.4 to 14.7) versus 
41.4% (95% CI, 33.2 to 49.4) (Fig. 2C).
In the intention-to-treat population, an inves-
tigator-assessed response occurred in 126 patients 
in the alectinib group (response rate, 82.9%; 
95% CI, 76.0 to 88.5) and in 114 patients in the 
crizotinib group (response rate, 75.5%; 95% CI, 
67.8 to 82.1) (P 
= 
0.09) (Table 2). The duration of 
response was longer with alectinib than with 
crizotinib (hazard ratio for progression or death, 
0.36 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.53]; median duration of 
response, not estimable [95% CI, not estimable] 
vs. 11.1 months [95% CI, 7.9 to 13.0]). The 12- 
month event-free rate was 72.5% (95% CI, 64.6 
to 80.4) in the alectinib group and 44.1% (95% 
CI, 34.5 to 53.6) in the crizotinib group.

Alectinib vs. Crizotinib in ALK-Positive Lung Cancer
at baseline, a CNS response occurred in 17 of 21 
patients in the alectinib group (CNS response 
rate, 81%; 95% CI, 58 to 95) and in 11 of 22 
patients in the crizotinib group (CNS response 
rate, 50%; 95% CI, 28 to 72); 8 patients (38%) in 
the alectinib group had a complete CNS response, 
as compared with 1 patient (5%) in the crizo-
tinib group (Table 2). The median duration of 
intracranial response was 17.3 months (95% CI, 
14.8 to not estimable) and 5.5 months (95% CI, 
2.1 to 17.3), respectively. Among patients with 
measurable or nonmeasurable CNS lesions at base-
line, a CNS response occurred in 38 of 64 pa-
tients in the alectinib group (CNS response rate, 
59%; 95% CI, 46 to 71) and in 15 of 58 patients 
in the crizotinib group (CNS response rate, 26%; 
95% CI, 15 to 39); 29 patients (45%) in the alec-
tinib group had a complete CNS response, as com-
pared with 5 patients (9%) in the crizotinib group.
At the date of data cutoff, death had occurred 
in 75 patients in the intention-to-treat population 
(35 patients [23%] in the alectinib group and 
40 patients [26%] in the crizotinib group). The 
12-month survival rate was 84.3% (95% CI, 78.4 
to 90.2) with alectinib and 82.5% (95% CI, 76.1 
to 88.9) with crizotinib. The hazard ratio for death 
was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.48 to 1.20), and the median 
overall survival was not estimable in either group 
(Fig. 2D).
Safety
The median duration of treatment was 17.9 months 
(range, 0 to 29) with alectinib and 10.7 months 
(range, 0 to 27) with crizotinib. The mean dose 
intensity (±SD) was 95.6±10.3% with alectinib 
and 92.4±14.1% with crizotinib (dose intensity is 
the amount of trial drug actually received divided 
by the expected amount).
Adverse events that occurred at a higher inci-
dence with alectinib than with crizotinib by 5 per-
centage points or more were anemia (20% vs. 
5%), myalgia (16% vs. 2%), increased blood bili-
rubin (15% vs. 1%), increased weight (10% vs. 
0%), musculoskeletal pain (7% vs. 2%), and photo-
sensitivity reaction (5% vs. 0%) (Table 3). Adverse 
events that were more common with crizotinib 
included nausea (48% vs. 14% with alectinib), 
diarrhea (45% vs. 12%), and vomiting (38% vs. 
7%) (Table 3).
Grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurred in 41% 
of the patients treated with alectinib and 50% of 
the patients treated with crizotinib (Table S2 in

Figure 2. Efficacy Outcomes in the Intention-to-Treat Population.
Panel A shows Kaplan–Meier estimates of investigator-assessed progression-free survival, according to treatment group. The hazard ra-
tio was estimated by means of Cox regression. The Brookmeyer and Crowley method was used to compute confidence intervals for the 
median progression-free survival times. The hazard ratio and P value were stratified according to race (Asian vs. non-Asian) and the 
presence or absence of CNS metastases at baseline, as assessed by the independent review committee. Panel B shows progression-free 
survival (investigator-assessed) across predefined patient subgroups. Values for the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) per-
formance status are on a 5-point scale, with higher numbers reflecting greater disability. Panel C shows the cumulative incidence of 
CNS progression, as assessed by the independent review committee according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 
1.1. Values were adjusted for the competing risks of non-CNS progression and death. Panel D shows overall survival.

the Supplementary Appendix). The most common 
grade 3 to 5 adverse events in both groups were 
laboratory abnormalities. Adverse events that oc-
curred in at least 10% of the patients in either 
treatment group are shown in Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. Serious adverse events 
were reported in 28% of the patients treated 
with alectinib and 29% of the patients treated 
with crizotinib (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Fatal adverse events occurred in 3% 
and 5% of the patients, respectively; two deaths 
with crizotinib and none with alectinib were 
reported by investigators as being related to the 
trial treatment. Adverse events leading to dose 
reduction, interruption, or discontinuation were 
reported in 16%, 19%, and 11%, respectively, of 
the patients treated with alectinib and in 21%, 
25%, and 13%, respectively, of the patients 
treated with crizotinib.

tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was shown to be supe-
rior to platinum–pemetrexed chemotherapy in 
the PROFILE 1014 trial, establishing it as the 
standard first-line therapy for patients with ALK-
positive NSCLC.1 In our trial alectinib was associ-
ated with a 53% lower risk of progressive disease 
or death than was crizotinib (hazard ratio, 0.47; 
95% CI, 0.34 to 0.65; P<0.001; 12-month event-
free rate, 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with 
crizotinib). The results for independent review 
committee–assessed progression-free survival were 
consistent with those for the primary end point, 
confirming that progression-free survival was 
significantly longer with alectinib than with 
crizotinib (median progression-free survival, 25.7 
months [95% CI, 19.9 to not estimable] vs. 10.4 
months [95% CI, 7.7 to 14.6]; hazard ratio, 0.50 
[95% CI, 0.36 to 0.70]; P<0.001). The median 
progression-free survival that was achieved with 
crizotinib in our trial (11.1 months) was consis-
tent with that observed in the PROFILE 1014 
trial (10.9 months)1 and the PROFILE 1029 trial

Alectinib vs. Crizotinib in ALK-Positive Lung Cancer
(11.1 months).13 Overall survival data from our 
trial are currently immature, and a follow-up 
analysis will be performed when approximately 
50% of the patients have died. Alectinib may 
increase overall survival as a result of the im-
proved control of systemic and CNS disease; 
however, this needs to be confirmed in a future 
analysis of mature data on survival events.
The results of our trial are supported by those 
of the J-ALEX trial (JapicCTI-132316) involving 
Japanese patients with ALK-positive advanced 
NSCLC not previously treated with ALK tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors.14 That trial showed the supe-
riority of alectinib over crizotinib in terms of 
progression-free survival (hazard ratio for dis-
ease progression or death, 0.34; 99.7% CI, 0.17 
to 0.71; P<0.001; median progression-free sur-
vival, not estimable [95% CI, 20.3 months to not 
estimable] with alectinib vs. 10.2 months [95% 
CI, 8.2 to 12.0] with crizotinib).14 The rate of CNS 
metastases at baseline appears higher in our 
trial (38 to 42%) than in other studies of first-
line treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC (26 to 
27% in the PROFILE 1014 trial and 31 to 33% in 
the ASCEND-4 trial), which is possibly related to 
the fact that we performed systematic brain im-
aging at baseline.1,15
The method of analysis of CNS end points in 
our trial takes into account the competing risks 
inherent in evaluating CNS progression (i.e., non-
CNS progression and death) and was based on an 
assessment by the independent review committee 
that was conducted solely for the purpose of as-
sessing CNS disease. The time to CNS progres-
sion was significantly longer with alectinib than 
with crizotinib (cause-specific hazard ratio, 0.16, 
95% CI, 0.10 to 0.28; rate of events of CNS pro-
gression, 12% with alectinib and 45% with 
crizotinib), and the CNS results shown in this 
trial confirm the efficacy of alectinib in treating 
ALK-positive disease, both in patients with and 
patients without CNS lesions at baseline.
The safety profile of alectinib compared favor-
ably with that of crizotinib, despite the longer 
duration of treatment (median, 17.9 months vs. 
10.7 months), and is consistent with that reported 
in previous studies.12,16 Grade 3 to 5 adverse 
events were more frequent with crizotinib than 
with alectinib. In addition, rates of adverse events 
leading to dose reduction, interruption, or dis-
continuation were lower with alectinib.
In summary, alectinib was associated with 
longer progression-free survival and lower toxic-
ity than crizotinib and showed activity against 
CNS disease in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.
