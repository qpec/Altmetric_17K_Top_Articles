To effortlessly complete an intentional movement, the brain needs feedback from the body regarding the move-
ment’s progress. This largely nonconscious kinesthetic sense helps the brain to learn relationships between motor 
commands and outcomes to correct movement errors. Prosthetic systems for restoring function have predominantly 
focused on controlling motorized joint movement. Without the kinesthetic sense, however, these devices do not be-
come intuitively controllable. We report a method for endowing human amputees with a kinesthetic perception of 
dexterous robotic hands. Vibrating the muscles used for prosthetic control via a neural-machine interface produced 
the illusory perception of complex grip movements. Within minutes, three amputees integrated this kinesthetic feed-
back and improved movement control. Combining intent, kinesthesia, and vision instilled participants with a sense of 
agency over the robotic movements. This feedback approach for closed-loop control opens a pathway to seamless 
integration of minds and machines.
INTRODUCTION
Spatial awareness of the body, a cornerstone of purposeful movement, 
is informed by a host of sensory inputs from the muscles, tendons, 
joints, and skin. During motor execution, this sense is used by the 
brain’s internal forward model to predict the physical outcomes of 
motor commands (1). These predictions are then compared with feed-
back coming from muscle motion sensors (the kinesthetic sense) to 
compute movement errors and make fine adjustments (1). Despite its 
central role in movement, how the kinesthetic sense operates is poorly 
understood, and currently, there are no effective treatments to restore 
impaired kinesthesia (2).
Individuals with amputation are provided with increasingly so-
phisticated prosthetic options for restoring the lost ability to move, but 
less emphasis has been placed on restoring the lost kinesthetic sensa-
tion that guides movements. Many upper limb amputees still prefer 
older cable-actuated split-hook grippers and body-powered elbows 
because joint movements can be intuitively felt through the cable sys-
tem (3, 4). By contrast, motorized prosthetic hands provide no mean-
ingful feedback for movement or touch and must be carefully watched 
during the entirety of movement to perform even the simplest of tasks, 
much to the detriment of efficient control or multitasking (4, 5). In 
addition, vision is a poor substitute for kinesthesia (6) and cannot 
fully compensate for the loss of the intrinsic sensory mechanisms for 
movement prediction, error correction, experiential learning, and self- 
reference (7).
Substantial advances have been made in cutaneous touch feed-
back (pressure, tapping, moving touch, vibration, and texture) in hu-
mans through the use of implanted and regenerative neural interfaces 
(8–12). However, kinesthesia (pure movement sensation) is an entire-
ly distinct sensory modality from touch (contact and force sensation). 
Brain cortical electrical microstimulation, external feedback substi-
tution, and learning approaches in a primate model showed that 
hand position information is critical for improving motor control (13). 
However, substituting external feedback for the lost intrinsic sensation 
requires learning new associations between these previously unrelated 
pathways. In human amputees, stimulation via implanted peripheral 
nerve electrodes can provide the ability to sense passive elbow joint 
positions and finger movements (12, 14), and movement feedback 
in closed-loop motor control was feasible and effective in functional 
single-participant and single-percept demonstrations of concept (15, 16). 
However, a comprehensive functional and perceptual framework for 
kinesthesia in applied prosthetic systems is still lacking (2, 13, 17, 18).
Beyond the critical role of kinesthesia in motor execution and error 
correction, the congruency between intentional movements and the 
immediate sensory feedback from the movements themselves pro-
vides a sense of authorship (agency) that distinguishes one’s own ac-
tions from those of others (19). Prosthetic limbs do not provide the 
movement feedback that makes the user feel as though he or she is in 
control of their actions. Establishing a sense of agency for these devices 
will help amputees intrinsically feel in control of their artificial limbs, 
a key aspect of user acceptance.
Here, we used vibration-induced perceptual movement illusions 
in a human bidirectional neural-machine interface to generate the 
kinesthetic sensations of complex synergistic grip movements. This 
engineered perception of movement runs automatically within the

RESULTS
Vibration-induced kinesthetic illusions produce perception 
of complex grip movements in human amputees
In able-bodied individuals, vibrating limb tendons at 70 to 115 Hz 
generates a joint-specific perception of movement, although the joint 
crossed by the tendon is not physically changing position (20). This 
kinesthetic illusion is strong enough to give an individual the impres-
sion that their extremities are assuming impossible positions (21, 22), 
and complex three-dimensional arm movements have been simulated 
by inducing multi-joint kinesthetic illusions (23).
We investigated the use of vibration to elicit illusions of movement 
in a group of individuals with upper limb amputation who had un-
dergone targeted reinnervation to create a biological neural-machine 
interface for prosthetic control and feedback (24–26). Specifically, mo-
tor and sensory nerves remaining after amputation were surgically re-
directed to reinnervate new proximal muscle and skin sites. Therefore, 
attempts to move the missing limbs trigger contraction of the reinner-
vated muscles. The resulting electromyographic (EMG) signals are 
then used to intuitively control computerized motor-driven prosthetic 
limbs (25). A touch to the reinnervated skin feels like a touch to the 
hand that is no longer there, with normal sensory thresholds for vibra-
tion, pressure, heat, cold, and pain (27).
Using a hand-held vibration unit, we vibrated the proximal rein-
nervated residual muscles of six amputee participants [Par 1 to Par 6; 
90 Hz, 500 m neutral to peak (28, 29)], and they used their intact 
hand to demonstrate what they felt (30, 31). Despite the complete ab-
sence of the distal limb from above the elbow or higher, every amputee 
participant spontaneously reported perceiving functionally relevant 
complex movement in their missing hand, wrist, or elbow (Fig. 1). We 
isolated 22 individual movement percepts across the six amputees. 
Muscles reinnervated by the median nerve provided various percepts 
of digit flexion. Muscles reinnervated by the radial nerve provided per-
cepts of extension. The perceived movements were experienced as 
synergistic hand gestures despite being elicited in the biceps, triceps, 
brachialis, and pectoralis (fig. S1), without cutaneous tactile corre-
spondence in the overlying skin (fig. S1). These results suggest that the 
sensory-neural structure of the elbow and shoulder muscles was reas-
signed through reinnervation by the nerves originally serving the hand. 
In five participants, we investigated the relationship between vibra-
tional frequency and amplitude and the reported magnitude of the 
vibration-induced illusion. Using a linear motor, we applied vibration 
to the strongest reinnervated muscle percept site for each participant 
at 100-, 300-, or 500-m (neutral to peak) displacements at 10, 30, 50, 
70, 90, or 110 Hz. We found that the participants reported the highest 
magnitude estimates of illusory movement strength (0 to 5 on a Likert 
scale) for each of the three amplitudes at frequencies between 70 and 
110 Hz (fig. S2), which falls within the reported band of the kinesthetic 
illusion (20, 32, 33).
Active muscle contraction can influence either the amplitude (34) 
or the speed (35, 36) of the illusion or abolish it altogether (37). We 
tested both active and passive configurations using physical and vir-
tual prosthetic limbs substituting for the absence of an intact limb in 
our amputee participants. In conventional studies, active corresponds 
to the participant moving their own limb, whereas passive corre-
sponds to the tester moving the limb for them (fig. S3). In three ampu-
tees (Par 1, Par 2, and Par 5), we used a custom wearable vibration unit

(kinesthetic tactor) to stimulate the muscles and a 22-sensor data glove 
worn on their remaining hand to capture the reproduced hand kine-
matics (angle, range, position, and speed) as they matched the kines-
thetic illusory sensation from their reinnervated muscle in response to 
90-Hz vibration under active and passive conditions (30, 31). Figure 2 
shows representative finger joint kinematics for each participant’s 
hand-close percept that all progress from open to closed under differ-
ent active and passive conditions on different days of the experiments 
(Fig. 2A). The illusory movement percepts had definitive stop posi-
tions, where the perceived hand motion ended even with continued 
vibration or muscle contraction (movie S1). For two of the three am-
putees (Par 2 and Par 5), active movements were perceived as faster 
than passive ones (Bonferroni-corrected t tests: Par 2 and Par 5, each 
P < 0.001; movie S1). The root mean square differences (RMSDs) be-
tween the joint angle trajectories (Fig. 2B) and Pearson’s correlations 
(Fig. 2C) demonstrate that overall grip shape and involved digits were 
similar between the two conditions across all testing days for all partic-
ipants. Furthermore, the targeted reinnervation amputees reported 
feeling the sensation of their hand closing when they contracted their 
muscle control sites. We refer to this as the intrinsic motor percept, 
and the RMSDs between the joint angle trajectories and Pearson’s cor-
relations from the data glove kinematics in Par 1 and Par 5 verified that 
vibration and active muscle contraction both elicited similar percepts 
(Fig. 2).
Real-time illusory feedback improves movement control 
when using a virtual reality prosthetic system
To make efficient reach and grasp movements, people need to be able 
to control their grip aperture without looking at their hand. Normally, 
individuals fixate on the object of interest and then use propriocep-
tive feedback to pre-position their hand (38). By contrast, motorized- 
prosthesis users rely entirely on vision to position their artificial hands 
(39). To determine whether kinesthetic illusory input could be used 
for natural pre-positioning without vision, we linked the EMG hand-
close signal (cylinder grip) in Par 1, Par 2, and Par 5 to the movement 
of a virtual prosthesis rendered with the MuJoCo HAPTIX physics 
engine [see Materials and Methods (40)]. Closing the virtual prosthetic 
hand triggered the control system to elicit the illusory percept of cylin-
der grip movement by vibrating their reinnervated biceps with a wear-
able kinesthetic tactor. We randomly showed the participants images 
of their own percept at 25, 50, 75, and 100% closed positions and in-
structed them to close their hand to match the position of the picture. 
Each time they closed the virtual prosthesis, they were randomly pro-
vided with 90-Hz illusory kinesthetic feedback, 20-Hz sham vibratory 
feedback, or no vibratory feedback (as a normal motorized prosthetic 
hand would operate; fig. S4A). They could not see their virtual pros-
thesis from which we recorded grip kinematics, and they were not in-
formed of their performance during the testing. For ideal proportional 
performance, participants should have equal time-to-close intervals for 
each target step (Fig. 3A, black rectangles). We found that, with vibration- 
induced kinesthetic illusory feedback, the amputee participants did 
not need to see their hands to control them accurately. With 90-Hz 
stimulation, all participants achieved near ideal proportionality of 
close time intervals as can be seen in the close registration between 
the black and teal rectangles in Fig. 3A. Whereas with the 20-Hz sham 
(purple rectangles) and no feedback (orange rectangles), the partic-
ipants showed less registration with the ideal proportional goals. Al-
though this effect was most noticeable in Par 2, who had little sense of 
hand position without vibratory feedback (orange rectangles), the illu-
sory input also improved the performance of Par 1 and Par 5 who at 
baseline already operated their devices well with respect to this task. 
Furthermore, with the 90-Hz stimulation feedback, all of the partici-
pants performed indistinguishably from a cohort of five able-bodied 
individuals presented with an analogous task (fig. S4B). The amputees’ 
values for degree of alignment with the ideal proportional perfor-
mance (dashed lines shown in Fig. 3A) clustered together within 2 SDs 
of that for the average able-bodied participants (Fig. 3B). Alignment 
values were 0.014, 0.024, and 0.032 for Par 1, Par 2, and Par 5, respec-
tively, and 0.064 ± 0.029 for able-bodied participants (alignment is the 
RMSD between actual and ideal time to target normalized to the ideal 
time to a target close grip of 100%).
When correcting for errors in movement, the degree of response 
takes into account the uncertainty intrinsic to each type of feedback 
characterizing the movement itself (41, 42). Feedback with higher 
fidelity (less uncertainty) is trusted more. The magnitude of error cor-
rection, quantified as a trial-by-trial adaptation rate, lets us assess the 
trust afforded to the feedback provided relative to the participant’s 
expectation (internal model) of their intended movement (43, 44). In-
creased trust in feedback leads to an increased trial-by-trial adaptation 
rate when calculated from the participant’s correction to self-generated 
errors without external perturbation (41). We used the trial-by-trial 
adaptation rate to measure the level of trust afforded to the kinesthetic 
illusory feedback for Par 1 and Par 2. The participants completed blocks 
of repeated grasping trials under four specific feedback conditions 
(visual + 90-Hz kinesthetic, 90-Hz kinesthetic alone, visual alone, or 
20-Hz sham alone; fig. S5A). They used a virtual prosthesis to catch 
a falling block at a predetermined position, while we recorded their 
movement errors (fig. S5B). After a brief familiarization, they caught 
the block 25 consecutive times for each feedback condition, totaling 
100 trials before a break. This was repeated five times, with the presen-
tation order of each condition randomized each time. We calculated 
the trial-by-trial adaptation rate as a slope of the magnitude of correc-
tion from one trial to the next, relative to the magnitude of error for 
each trial itself (Fig. 3C and fig. S5C). Unrestricted vision is a trusted 
source of feedback (42, 45). We found that, in both Par 1 and Par 2, 
kinesthetic illusory feedback alone appeared to have adaptation rates in 
a similar range to those observed for vision only and vision + kinesthesia 
(Fig. 3C). Sham vibration appeared to tend toward lower adaptation 
rates, corresponding to lower feedback trust (Fig. 3C). Although statis-
tical significance could not be established because of low subject num-
bers, we observed these trends in both participants. Adaptation rates 
for sham feedback were 19.1 to 28.4% lower than the rates for the other 
feedback types. This suggests a decrease in adaptation rate that aligns 
with differences observed between treatment groups in other studies 
[14.5 to 20.5% differences in adaptation rate (43)].
In Par 1, Par 2, and Par 5, we compared the relative importance of 
vision to vibration-induced illusory kinesthesia on task performance 
to see whether the two channels could be optimally integrated, as 
shown previously with the combination of visual and haptic feedback 
in able-bodied humans (46). We calculated system variance estima-
tions representing the combination of sensory and controller noise 
using a two-alternative forced-choice task. Participants used the EMG- 
controlled virtual prosthesis to catch a falling block at a specific po-
sition and were asked to choose which of two grasping trials was 
perturbed by a random externally-applied control onset delay (fig. S5D). 
The control delay was decreased for correct selections and increased 
for incorrect selections resulting in an adaptive staircase that was used 
to adjust the perturbation-delay magnitude to establish the 84% level

just-noticeable difference (JND) (fig. S5E) 
(47). Limited subject numbers prevented 
robust statistical analysis, but consistent 
trends emerged. With the four feedback 
conditions, we found that kinesthesia al-
ways provided lower uncertainty than vi-
sion, even for the participants who fixated 
on vision and seemed unaware of the 
vibrations. Sham vibration feedback re-
sulted in high variability of system vari-
ance across the three participants, whereas 
the other feedback modalities were sta-
ble. Furthermore, all participants also in-
tegrated vision and kinesthesia to form an 
even more accurate estimate of their sys-
tem’s performance (a lower JND). Ernst 
and Banks’ optimal estimation integra-
tion equation (46) mathematically predicts 
the optimal fusion for such systems (see 
Materials and Methods)—Par 1 and Par 2 
operated within milliseconds of these pre-
dictions (Fig. 3D). These results suggest 
that the vibration-induced illusory kines-
thetic perception provides lower feedback 
variance than the other modalities pro-
vided, and it is nearly optimally integrated 
together with vision when movement sense 
is coupled to motor control.
Simultaneous vibration of agonist- 
antagonist muscle pairs abolishes the illu-
sory perception of limb movement (20). 
We next determined whether the kines-
thetic illusory approach would work in 
the context of a prosthetic system, where 
agonist- 
antagonist muscle pairs are used 
to control opposing hand movements. 
Par 5 was fit with two sets of EMG electrode/
tactor (movement control/feedback per-
ception) pairs, running in parallel, on the 
reinnervated biceps (hand-close coupled 
to the cylinder grip percept) and triceps 
(hand-open coupled to the hand-open per-
cept; fig. S6). We provided three feedback 
conditions [90-Hz illusory kinesthetic vi-
bration, 20-Hz vibration, and no vibration 
(0 Hz)], and as with a normal prosthesis, 
contracting both muscle control sites 
simultaneously (co-contraction) did not 
produce movement of the virtual hand 
and did not trigger a feedback condition. 
We showed the participant a video of a 
virtual prosthetic hand repeatedly per-
forming symmetrical cycles of a close-
open-close movement that they watched 
and attempted to track with their EMG- 
 
controlled virtual prosthesis, which was 
hidden from view (movie S2). We com-
pared the time spent closing and the time 
spent opening the virtual hand to those

n = 2004) = 173.3, P < 0.001; Bonferroni-corrected z tests: close P < 
0.001, open P > 0.5]. By contrast, for the 20-Hz and no-feedback 
conditions, the time spent closing and the time spent opening sig-
nificantly deviated from both the target signal and the 90-Hz illusory 
kinesthetic vibration [Bonferroni-corrected 2 goodness-of-fit tests: 
2(2, n = 2004) = 265.2 (20 Hz versus target), 420.7 (0 Hz versus 
target), 107.4 (20 Hz versus 90 Hz), 304.6 (0 Hz versus 90 Hz); P < 
0.001; Bonferroni-corrected z tests, P < 0.011]. In both of these con-
ditions, the virtual hand closed less and opened more than the target, 
which can be seen as a divergence of the purple and orange lines 
from the black target signal line (Fig. 3E). These results provide evi-
dence that the vibration-induced kinesthetic perceptual feedback 
augmented the functional precision of the participant’s continuous 
motor output without vision. Furthermore, these results also show 
that the illusory kinesthetic feedback operates effectively within a 
myoelectric paired agonist-antagonist prosthetic control system 
(movie S2).

accurately reach proportioned intervals in a grip conformation task (25, 50, 75, and 100% hand closed) while receiving no (0 Hz; orange), 20-Hz (purple), and 90-Hz (teal) 
vibratory feedback. Actual intervals between targets (colored rectangles) are compared to the ideal intervals fit to each participant’s actual performance times (black open 
rectangles). The actual times to target position are shown as circles with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals (CIs; n = 20), which specify the height of the colored 
rectangles. The ideal change in time to target position between percent close positions (black open rectangles) is specified by the linear regression with intercept set at 
zero (black dotted line). Alignment between the black open rectangles and the colored rectangles is an indication of the participant’s ability to reach the proportional de-
grees of closure. (B) Line graph showing degree of alignment with ideal proportional performance in the grip conformation task shown in (A) for amputee participants

Combining intent, illusory kinesthetic feedback, and vision 
establishes agency over movements
Movements are executed with an intrinsic understanding of the ex-
pected consequences of those actions (48). A sense of agency over our 
movements is established when we engage in a goal-directed action, 
and sensory feedback tells us that we have completed that action (49). 
We used explicit and implicit measures of agency to examine the par-
ticipants’ responses to combinations of intent, visual feedback, and il-
lusory movement sensation. Questionnaires are an established method 
for exploring the explicit experience of agency and provide insight into 
self-attributions of movement (50, 51). A match between intent and 
sensory feedback creates a sense of agency, which can be implicitly mea-
sured as a perceptual compression of time between intent and out-
come (intentional binding) (52). We displayed the virtual prosthetic 
hand on a horizontal monitor positioned in front of Par 1, Par 2, and 
Par 5 (fig. S7A). Closing their virtual prosthetic hand to touch a virtu-
al ball positioned at their fingertips triggered a vibration through the 
kinesthetic tactor to induce their cylinder grip percept. Contact with 
the ball sounded a tone with a random delay of 300, 500, or 700 ms. 
The participants were told that the touch-tone time delay varied ran-
domly over 1 s, and they were instructed to report their estimation of 
the delay on a scale from 1 to 1000 ms (fig. S7B) (51). Seven testing 
conditions (fig. S7C) were presented. At the end of each tested condi-
tion, the participants filled out a 16-question agency/embodiment ques-
tionnaire (fig. S7D) (50, 53).
The questionnaire results showed that the vibration-induced kin-
esthetic perceptual feedback provided significantly greater experience 
of authorship over movements (agency; linear mixed model, inter-
action effect of condition by question type, P < 0.001; Bonferroni- 
corrected post hoc t tests, each P ≤ 0.040) for a virtual prosthesis when 
intent, movement perception, and visual information were congruent 
(90-Hz vibration applied, no vibration applied, and moved too fast), 
compared with visualizations that did not match intention or percep-
tion (delayed, moved oppositely, or moved passively; Fig. 4A). Although 
voluntary contraction of the reinnervated muscle without vibration 
(the intrinsic motor percept) scored highly on the experience of agen-
cy, illusion-inducing vibration was required to provide effective motor 
control [see 0 Hz (no vibration) in Fig. 3, A, B, and E]. A virtual pros-
thesis that moved faster (too fast) than the vibration-induced illusory 
kinesthetic percept scored significantly higher than one with an onset 
delay, one that moved opposite the perceived motion, or one that was 
moved passively by the experimenter (Bonferroni-corrected post hoc 
t tests, each P ≤ 0.037), suggesting greater attribution of agency to a 
virtual hand that moved more like the speed of a commercial prosthesis. 
Conversely, passive experimenter-driven activation of the vibration- 
induced illusory movement strongly reduced the experience of agency 
(Bonferroni-corrected post hoc t tests, each P ≤ 0.002 for all conditions 
except the opposite movement, P = 0.388, which also reduced agency 
itself). Providing illusory movement perception did not induce a sense 
of limb ownership (embodiment) under any condition (score range, 
0.1 to 1.9); however, disagreements with statements of embodiment 
were significantly more pronounced when the visualized movement was 
opposite (opposite movement) from the vibration-induced illusory 
movement (Bonferroni-corrected post hoc t tests comparing with other 
conditions, each P ≤ 0.048). These results provide evidence that the 
90-Hz illusory kinesthetic feedback is sufficient to drive the top-down 
explicit experience of agency for a volitionally controlled prosthesis.
A sense of agency over movement binds together intent and out-
come in time (intentional binding). Interval estimation provides a 
measure of agency through intentional binding where a stronger sense 
of agency corresponds to a shorter reported time interval. Although 
the intentional binding interval estimation responses for the amputee 
participants were not significantly different between the conditions 
(linear mixed model main effect for condition P = 0.179), they did 
share a weak negative relationship (76% confidence) with the agency 
responses from the questionnaires; as agency increased, interval esti-
mations decreased [Spearman correlation, (16) = −0.29, P = 0.240; 
Fig. 4B]. Similar to the questionnaire responses, we observed that the 
shortest reported delays tended to be associated with visualized move-
ments that matched intent (baseline, too fast, and too slow), and again, 
a hand that moved faster than the vibration-induced illusory percept 
produced the shortest interval estimates. The interval estimates pro-
vide support for the idea that the 90-Hz illusory kinesthetic feedback 
helps provide a bottom-up implicit sense of agency.
The vibration-induced kinesthetic perceptual feedback 
operates within clinical constraints
The standard of care for prosthetic limb attachment is a rigid socket 
that surrounds the residuum to mechanically couple the device to the 
underlying bone through the soft tissue. To verify that our approach 
could be translated effectively to the clinic, we implemented the per-
ceptual kinesthetic feedback within the tight physical constraints of 
a prosthetic limb. We fit Par 5 with a thermoplastic prosthetic socket 
that incorporated EMG for control and vibratory stimulation for kin-
esthetic perceptual feedback. We used a dexterous robotic hand with 
individually powered digits to assume the identified grip conforma-
tions (fig. S8A). When the participant signaled (EMG) hand-close, it 
triggered the 90-Hz illusory kinesthetic feedback for cylinder grip with 
the hand programmed to simultaneously move into the same confor-
mation at a rate similar to the reported speed of the participant’s illu-
sory percept (Fig. 5A). The robotic hand took 5.00 s to progress from 
fully open to the close point, where the index finger and thumb 
touched. For each session, the participant reported the sensation by 
using their intact hand to match the illusory movement percept of the 
missing hand (30, 31). The goal of the experiment was to see whether 
the participant could reliably duplicate the movement of the robotic 
hand without being able to see it. The participant closed the robotic 
prosthetic hand for an average of 4.86 ± 1.17 s [Fig. 5B, y axis (blue)]. 
That ending point was within 140 ms of the 5.00-s actual ideal index- 
thumb contact time for the robotic fingers (Fig. 5B, black crosshairs), 
falling within the 95% confidence interval (4.46 to 5.27 s), which did 
not represent a significant difference in timing. Similarly, the partici-
pant’s other hand that was being used to match the perceived illusion 
started moving with the onset of their EMG control signal (−0.04 ± 
0.46 s) and stopped at an average of 4.76 ± 1.36 s later [Fig. 5B, x axis 
(red)]. This ending point was within 240 ms of the actual ideal 5.00-s 
index-thumb contact time of the prosthetic fingers (movie S3). These 
results demonstrate that the 90-Hz kinesthetic perceptual feedback 
can be used to reliably duplicate the movement of an unseen prosthetic 
hand in the context of a clinical prosthetic limb.
With all of the experimental approaches, we found that Par 1, Par 2, 
and Par 5 were able to contract their myosites to control the virtual 
and physical prosthetic hands while simultaneously receiving illusory 
feedback. However, muscle vibration has been shown to reflexively 
activate muscle contraction, which could confound clinical imple-
mentation (54). We analyzed EMG recording data from the first set of 
passive (90-Hz vibration) and active (volitional muscle contraction 
with 90-Hz vibration) trials, compared to baseline EMG (the quiescent

period before application of vibration/contraction) for Par 1, Par 2, and 
Par 5 during the intentional binding experiments (fig. S9). With the 
application of 90-Hz vibration, there was a slight increase (nonsignif-
icant for Par 1 and Par 2; Bonferroni-corrected t tests: Par 1, P = 0.072; 
Par 2, P > 0.5; Par 5, P < 0.001) in average muscle activity over baseline 
(1.4× above baseline; fig. S9A). However, this effect was significantly 
lower (Bonferroni-corrected t tests, each P < 0.001) than the average 
level of normal volitional contraction used to drive the EMG control 
signal (7.5× above baseline; fig. S9A). Although reflexive contraction 
may be responsible for increased muscle tonal activity during 90-Hz 
vibration, this signal is negligible in comparison to a normal muscle 
contraction and does not affect volitional EMG control (fig. S9B).
The passively applied kinesthetic illusion moved slowly (7 mm/s). 
Although the actively triggered kinesthetic percepts were an average of 
85% faster (52 mm/s; Bonferroni-corrected t tests, each P < 0.001; 
movie S1), they were still at the low end for the closing speed of a typ-
ical prosthetic hand (thumb to index, closing speed of 15 to 100 mm/s 
at speed setting 0; OttoBock MyoHand VariPlus Speed). Visualiza-
tions of different hand movement speeds have been shown to influ-
ence the perception of the kinesthetic illusion (55). To determine 
whether we could increase the movement speed of the perceived kin-
esthetic illusion, we developed a paradigm to condition Par 1, Par 2, 
and Par 5 to visually couple their perceived illusion to faster operation 
of the virtual hand (fig. S8B). The participants were instructed to close 
their virtual hand onto a small ball hovering between the fingertips as 
fast as they could before it turned red (movie S4). The ball started out 
black and then turned white to signal the participants to start closing 
the virtual hand. They did not actually control the speed of their hand. 
Instead, successfully catching the ball to turn it green was based on 
a reaction time grace period (≤500 ms) plus the time allowed for the 
speed of the hand close visualization itself. Failure on the trial resulted 
from either starting too soon or too late, and the reaction time grace 
period was adjusted so that they were not always successful but did not 
fail so often that they lost interest (fig. S8C and movie S4). The partic-
ipants were unaware that (i) they did not have control over their virtu-
al hand speed; (ii) success or failure was tied only to reaction time; and 
(iii) every 30 trials, the virtual hand visualization increased in speed 
and, when the speed could not be increased any further, the grace pe-
riod was reduced (fig. S8C). After each set of trials, the participants 
matched their actively triggered illusory percepts with their intact 
hand while wearing the data glove (movie S4). The data glove trajecto-
ries were used to calculate the demonstrated percept speeds and com-
pare them to a preconditioning baseline and the speed of a commercial 
prosthetic hand (OttoBock MyoHand VariPlus Speed). This condi-
tioning game increased the active peak percept speed in all three of the 
amputee participants (Bonferroni-corrected t tests first versus fastest 
percept captured: Par 1, P = 0.037; Par 2 and Par 5, P < 0.001; Fig. 5C). 
Par 5 showed the most marked change, with a peak post-conditioning 
speed that exceeded our capacity to make the virtual hand visualiza-
tion close any faster. Par 1 showed a small initial increase in peak speed 
but rapidly fatigued and was unable to continue the game. However, 
for the two participants who were able to complete the task (Par 2 and 
Par 5) the peak speeds were commensurate with speeds 0 and 1, re-
spectively, of the commercially available prosthetic hand, and Par 5’s 
percept speed remained high after a washout period (Bonferroni- 
corrected t tests first versus washout percept captured: Par 2, P = 0.171; 
Par 5, P < 0.001). These results demonstrate that the vibration-induced 
kinesthetic percepts can be rapidly visually updated to reach speed 
scales that are similar to commercially available prosthetic hands 
(movie S4).

higher-order input to human amputees about the ongoing movements 
of their artificial hands.
All the targeted reinnervation amputees tested reported kinesthetic 
percepts. They also independently reported similar complex synergis-
tic movement percepts that appear to reflect basic coordinated actions 
(movement primitives, synergies, or engrams) required for dexter-
ous manipulation (56). In our work and in sensory-neural stimulation 
studies for prosthetic feedback, we found that similar stereotypic grip 
conformation percepts such as fist closing (cylinder grip), tripod grip, 
and thumb-index fine pinch were often reported (15, 57, 58). In pe-
ripheral sensory-neural stimulation studies, subsets of afferents within 
nerves are stimulated through electrodes. Similarly, in targeted rein-
nervation, there is competition between the regenerating neurons for 
a limited number of neural targets in the denervated muscle and skin 
(59, 60). In these neural feedback approaches, there appears to be lim-
ited muscle sensation information returning to the brain through 
the interface as compared to able-bodied nerves, yet the amputee par-
ticipants across these studies describe stereotypic complex multidigit 
synergistic hand conformations. This suggests that the brain may be at-
tempting to contextualize the reduced sensory inputs in terms of basic 
modules of coordinated activity. Motor control and movement sensa-
tion face similar organizational challenges. Limbs and hands are capa-
ble of infinite combinations of movements to achieve any singular goal 
(61). The brain appears to simplify this infinitely high dimensionality 
by organizing movement control based on assemblages of basic coor-
dinated output patterns (62). The results we present here provide evi-
dence that the brain representational architecture of kinesthesia likely 
shares similar organizational properties with movement production.
Although evidence suggests that cutaneous innervation plays a key 
role in kinesthesia (37, 63), we found that the kinesthetic illusory per-
cepts were generated in participants in this study without cutaneous 
tactile sensation. Furthermore, among the participants in this study 
with both motor and sensory reinnervation, there was no consistent 
relationship between cutaneous touch in the skin and movement per-
cepts in the deep muscle. In able-bodied individuals, the illusory per-
ception of movement from muscle vibration is most often attributed 
to signals arising from muscle elongation (33). However, in the targeted 
reinnervation amputees, vibratory stimulation of muscles reinnervated 
by the median nerve produced illusions of flexion (not extension), 
whereas muscles innervated by the radial nerve produced illusions of 
extension (not flexion). This result has also been demonstrated in neu-
ral stimulation studies in amputees where stimulation of the median 
nerve produced percepts of digit flexion (57, 64). In both situations, 
the sensory stimulation giving rise to the movement percepts supports 
the idea that muscle afferents signaling active contraction may play a 
key role in kinesthesia.
Control of hand grip aperture is an elemental movement require-
ment for skilled prosthetic function. The participants showed high 
resolution of grip aperture using the vibration-induced kinesthetic il-
lusory feedback. The ability of amputee participants to couple illusory 
kinesthetic feedback with active control bodes well for restoring more 
normal reach-and-grasp functions. We also demonstrated the feasibil-
ity of having two tactors effectively running in agonist-antagonist 
muscle pairs during bidirectional grip aperture tracking, which con-
firmed the ability to use more than a single percept during continuous 
movement control, although this was only within the limitation of a 
single degree of freedom (grip open/close). Ideally, future work will 
explore incorporating additional joint movement percepts to repre-
sent multiple degrees of freedom. We also showed that adding vision to 
the vibration-induced kinesthetic perception would likely enhance the 
control strategy. Kinesthesia provided better temporal resolution than 
vision, and the best resolution was provided by vision and kinesthesia

to a real-time functional prosthetic hand clinically fitted to the participant with illusory feedback locked to their volitional control, which was used to explore clinical 
feasibility. Feedback pathways are represented in blue (VCLM, voice coil linear motor). Prosthesis control pathways are represented in red (participant control). Partici-
pants matched the perceived sensation with their intact hand, and prosthetic hand closing speed was timed to the demonstrated perceptual illusion. (B) Graph showing 
the average start/stop times of the control signal (n = 32; EMG-activated prosthetic hand closing, blue) and the average start/stop times of the concurrently demonstrated 
percept movement (n = 32; matching hand, red) superimposed over the ideal start and thumb–index finger contact times of the physical prosthetic hand under contin-
uous drive (black crosshairs, radius = 250 ms). The 5-s progression of movement from fully open to thumb–index finger contact for the physical prosthetic hand is our 
approximation of the participant’s demonstrated movement of the illusory percept (gray dashed lines). All events are plotted along time-linked axes. The raw matching 
hand movement start times (solid circles) and stop times (x’s) are colored according to relative position within the experimental timeline (first, blue; last, red). Gold stars 
represent the intersection of the average movement start and stop points for the EMG-control and the demonstrated movement. (C) Graph showing average percept

common commercially available prosthetic hand (OttoBock Speed 0 range).

together. The illusory kinesthetic feedback appears to work optimally 
when coupled with vision, as would occur in an intact person, which 
provides evidence that the kinesthetic perception provided by mus-
cle vibration can functionally integrate with existing natural sensory 
feedback.
Beyond motor control, the combination of vision and perceptual 
feedback has implications for the critical cognitive elements that deter-
mine the extent to which humans will integrate with machines. Pro-
prioception, touch, and vision integrate with each other to establish 
the awareness of self versus other. Agency (the experience of author-
ship of one’s movements) appears to arise from the integration of the 
internal model, vision, and movement sensation (19). By contrast, em-
bodiment (the experience of owning one’s body) arises primarily from 
the integration of vision and touch (65). Agency and embodiment 
both appear to contribute to a complete sense of body awareness (66); 
however, studies investigating whether movement and agency can 
help to enhance embodiment show contrasting results (50, 66). Inves-
tigations of the visual motor contribution to the experience of embod-
iment are constrained by using able-bodied individuals, invariably 
requiring tracking the movements of hands and digits that have intact 
cutaneous tactile sensation (66, 67). By contrast, the neural-machine 
interfaces used in this study allowed access to kinesthesia without touch 
sensation, therefore providing a unique opportunity to investigate the 
contribution of movement perception itself. Within this model sys-
tem, we found that the perception of kinesthesia alone elicited an ex-
perience of agency but did not provide a sense of embodiment.
Agency has special relevance for the clinical implementation of ad-
vanced prosthetic limbs because these devices are computerized ma-
chines, with which the amputee must cooperate to complete tasks. In 
human-human cooperation, the subjects are able to form a “unified 
agency” over movements (68). In human-computer partnerships, how-
ever, evidence suggests that the neural processes responsible for es-
tablishing agency are inhibited (69). Current prosthetic limbs can 
incorporate capabilities that do not include the user in the control 
loop, such as auto-grip slip detection. However, autonomous device 
functions that run outside of the user’s control are found to be frustrat-
ing to interact with (70). As advanced prosthetic limbs progress and 
become even more autonomous in their operation, establishing an 
intrinsic sense of agency for these devices through perceptual inte-
gration will be key to user acceptance and realization of the full func-
tional potential of computerized prosthetic limbs within a cooperative 
joint- 
agent partnership.
We report here that differences in the speed of the visualized hand 
movements influence the experience of agency. This is compelling 
because there was concern that a slow percept would prevent appro-
priate utilization of the vibration-induced movement percepts for 
prosthetic hand feedback. However, it appears that the opposite may 
be true. The visual update reflecting a faster hand not only effectively 
induced a sense of agency, but when coupled with the results of the 
speed game, it increased the speed of the vibration-induced movement 
percept. These results have direct implications for the clinical imple-
mentation of perceptual movement feedback; during regular prosthe-
sis use, the prosthetic hand would not need to be slowed to match the 
speed of the illusion. Instead, a prosthetic hand that moves quickly will 
likely be readily incorporated into the representational structure of the 
body schema, thus linking perception effectively to a hand speed that 
is typical of commercially available prostheses.
The illusory kinesthetic percepts were found in all six recruited 
participants in the initial mapping experiments. However, because of 
constraints from increasing demands on participant time, with each 
subsequent round of experimentation, we were unable to complete 
testing in the full amputee cohort. Statistical evaluation was limited by 
the small number of participants (n = 3) who could commit to the time 
and travel required to complete the full study protocol. The complex-
ity of implementing simultaneous feedback and control in a prosthetic 
system also presented technical challenges to study design. We fo-
cused on hand function first because the illusory percepts were pri-
marily hand focused and hand grasp is the most functionally relevant 
feature of upper limb prosthetic use. However, it has yet to be shown 
that kinesthetic feedback will improve prosthetic performance in daily 
activities. This will require extending beyond the virtual reality ap-
proaches that were used here. Furthermore, the inclusion of addition-
al feedback from multiple limb joints such as the wrist and elbow 
will be crucial to the functional use of wearable advanced devices and 
additional clinical testing will be essential to assess impact. This will 
require further refinement and miniaturization of kinesthetic feed-
back tactors to provide stimulation at multiple sites for induction of a 
greater number of movement percepts. It will also require refining and 
incorporating new methods of simultaneous multi-joint motor control 
(71). Furthermore, this study also did not include touch feedback, 
which will be necessary for full utilization of fine finger control, object 
manipulation, and functional stereognosis. However, as with the 
simultaneous implementation of kinesthesia and motor control, the 
addition of touch feedback further increases system complexity. Cur-
rently, we have no evidence to suggest that the vibration-induced illuso-
ry kinesthetic feedback is incompatible with tactile sensibility resulting 
from targeted reinnervation or any combination of kinesthesia, touch, 
or motor control in this neural-machine interface system. Current 
work is continuing to investigate multimodality integration and testing 
for motor control, kinesthesia, and touch. Further studies of movement 
percepts for other levels and locations of amputation and in amputees 
without a neural-machine interface are also ongoing.
Here, we provide evidence that the vibration-induced illusory per-
cepts have direct impact on mechanisms of motor control and induce 
agency with improved functional motor performance. This kinesthetic 
feedback does not need to be learned: turning it on allows the amputee 
participants to function indistinguishably from able-bodied individu-
als in grip aperture control, and turning it off abolishes the effect. The 
feedback system operates within the fitting constraints and control 
strategies of standard-of-care prosthetic limbs, and the results show 
that, with regular use, the movement percepts will likely adapt to the 
movement speed of commercial prosthetic hands. The approach re-
ported here is clinically feasible and provides a critical new element 
that could lead to fully integrated and efficient bidirectional prosthesis 
control. In the near future, joining together kinesthetic, cutaneous, 
and motor systems could result in cohesively integrated fully bidirec-
tional prosthetic limbs that are intuitively controlled, are cognitively 
embodied by touch (53), and provide a natural perceptual sense of com-
plex artificial hand movement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Our hypothesis was that we could elicit kinesthetic illusions of move-
ment in the missing limb of amputee participants who had undergone 
targeted reinnervation to provide relevant closed-loop feedback for 
prosthetic control. The goals were to (i) discover whether movement 
illusions could be elicited in the missing limb, (ii) investigate functional

use of the illusions and the impact on agency and internal dynamic 
model, and (iii) demonstrate clinical implementation. For the percept 
mapping, we recruited six upper limb amputee participants that had 
undergone targeted reinnervation (fig. S1) (24–26). For the psycho-
physical quantification, there was drop out of one participant due to 
time constraints. For the second set of experiments, a subset of three 
participants were available for the required days of testing (of the orig-
inal six participants, one could not participate because of health issues, 
and the other two had travel and time constraints limiting availability). 
During these visits, we investigated the illusory hand kinematics, grip 
aperture matching, adaptation and just-noticeable difference, inten-
tional binding, speed game, and agency experiments. For the adapta-
tion experiments, data from one participant (Par 5) were not able to be 
analyzed because of a change in experimental design, so results from 
two participants are provided. The last experimental goal investigating 
clinical implementation with bidirectional feedback required fitting a 
physical prosthetic device, and only one amputee was able to partici-
pate because of travel and availability constraints for the others. This 
participant also underwent the additional agonist-antagonist hand 
tracking experiment (fig. S6).
All experiments were conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki 
principles under the approval of the local institutional research ethics 
boards (IRB or ethics) at Cleveland Clinic, the Louis Stokes Cleveland 
Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the University of Alberta, and the Uni-
versity of New Brunswick. All amputee participants had previously un-
dergone targeted reinnervation (fig. S1) (24–26).
Statistical analysis
Two-tailed t tests for each participant compared means of measures 
dependent on one factor with two or three levels (Bonferroni-corrected 
for multiple participants and levels). Measures dependent on more 
than one factor or factors with multiple levels were first pooled across 
participants and fit with a linear mixed model with fixed effects for 
each factor and interaction, a random participant-specific intercept, 
and equal or unequal covariance between trials and trial variance 
depending on the structure that best fit the data as determined by 
Akaike’s information criterion. Bonferroni-corrected post hoc t tests 
explored significant main and interaction effects. Pearson’s correlations 
quantified similarity between trajectories and were averaged across 
conditions to create an overall measure of similarity. RMSDs quanti-
fied alignment between pairs of trajectories vector or response values 
and were averaged across pairs for an overall measure of alignment. 2 
goodness-of-fit tests and follow-up z tests between pairs quantified 
differences in proportions with Bonferroni correction across factor 
levels for the total number of 2 tests plus follow-up z tests. Comparisons 
were considered significant when P < 0.05. For details on statistical 
analyses for each experiment, please see Supplementary Materials and 
Methods.
