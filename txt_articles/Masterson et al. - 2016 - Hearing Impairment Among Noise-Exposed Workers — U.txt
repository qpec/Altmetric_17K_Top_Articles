Hearing loss is the third most common chronic physical 
condition in the United States, and is more prevalent than 
diabetes or cancer (1). Occupational hearing loss, primarily 
caused by high noise exposure, is the most common U.S. 
work-related illness (2). Approximately 22 million U.S. 
workers are exposed to hazardous occupational noise (3). 
CDC compared the prevalence of hearing impairment 
within nine U.S. industry sectors using 1,413,789 noise-
exposed worker audiograms from CDC’s National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Occupational 
Hearing Loss Surveillance Project (4). CDC estimated the 
prevalence at six hearing impairment levels, measured in 
the better ear, and the impact on quality of life expressed 
as annual disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), as defined 
by the 2013 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study (5). 
The mining sector had the highest prevalence of workers 
with any hearing impairment, and with moderate or worse

Workers’ Memorial Day —  
April 28, 2016
Workers’ Memorial Day, observed annually on April 28, 
recognizes workers who suffered or died because of expo-
sures to hazards at work. In 2014, 4,679 U.S. workers 
died from work-related injuries (1). Although deaths from 
work-related injuries are captured by surveillance systems, 
most deaths from work-related illness are not. In 2007, an 
estimated 53,445 deaths from work-related illness occurred 
(2). In 2014, employers reported approximately 3 million 
nonfatal injuries and illnesses to private industry workers 
and 722,000 to state and local government workers (3); 
an estimated 2.7 million work-related injuries were treated 
in emergency departments, resulting in 113,000 hospital-
izations (National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (CDC-NIOSH), unpublished data, 2016)*
Occupational injuries and illnesses also have economic 
costs. The societal cost of work-related fatalities, injuries, 
and illnesses was estimated at $250 billion in 2007 on 
the basis of methods that focus on medical costs and 
productivity losses (2).
New estimates of worker hearing impairment from the 
CDC-NIOSH Occupational Hearing Loss Surveillance 
program are reported in this issue of MMWR. The audio-
metric data analyzed in this report represent one example 
of existing health data that CDC-NIOSH uses for occu-
pational health surveillance.

impairment, followed by the construction and manufacturing 
sectors. Hearing loss prevention, and early detection and 
intervention to avoid additional hearing loss, are critical to 
preserve worker quality of life.
The NIOSH Occupational Hearing Loss Surveillance 
Project collects de-identified audiograms* for U.S. workers 
(4) who were tested to comply with regulatory requirements 
because of high occupational noise exposure, defined as 
≥85 decibels on the A-scale (dBA).† Audiometric service 
providers and others that perform worker testing agreed to 
share these data with NIOSH. A cross-sectional retrospective 
cohort analysis was conducted using the last audiogram 
completed for each worker during 2003–2012. Audiograms 
missing necessary fields or with other quality issues, having 
hearing threshold values that suggested testing errors, or 
displaying attributes unlikely to be primarily caused by 
occupational exposures, were excluded (4). Industries 
were classified using the 2007 North American Industry 
Classification System.§
The prevalences of six severity levels of hearing impairment 
were calculated for workers in each industry sector using 
the audiometric definitions from the GBD Study (Table 1) 
(5), except that workers in this sample who had hearing aids 
did not wear them during testing. DALYs representing the 
number of healthy years lost per 1,000 workers each year were 
calculated by industry sector using the GBD Study disability 
weights (Table 1).¶ Tinnitus information required to calculate 
the DALYs was not available in the NIOSH Occupational 
Hearing Loss Surveillance Project sample and was estimated 
using results from previous studies (6,7).**
The final sample included 1,413,789 audiograms for workers 
employed by 25,908 U.S. companies during 2003–2012. 
Among 99% of audiograms for which information on the 
worker’s sex was available, 78% were recorded for males and 
22% for females. A greater percentage of males had any hearing 
impairment (14%) than did females (7%), and the prevalence 
and severity of impairment increased with age (Table 2) for 
* Audiograms are the results of hearing tests.
† Decibel is a unit of measure of the intensity (or loudness). The A-scale is used 
because it corresponds better to the sound intensities perceived by the human 
ear at low frequencies.
§ North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes range from 
two-digit to six-digit numbers and industry specificity increases with each digit 
(https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/).
 ¶ For morbid conditions, such as hearing impairment, the burden over a one-
year period is represented by a “disability weight” between 0 and 1, representing 
life limitations as a lost fraction of a year of healthy life. Because the most 
recent audiograms for workers were used to characterize hearing impairment, 
the DALY results are an estimate of the annual number of DALYs per 1,000 
workers in the year of the last audiogram, and a minimum estimate of DALYs 
in following years. Thus, the DALY results are estimates of the annual DALYs 
per 1,000 workers as of 2012, the last year included in the analysis.
 
** Tinnitus prevalences were estimated using results for U.S. noise-exposed 
workers with daily or more frequent tinnitus comorbid with hearing loss 
(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajim.22565/epdf) and 
proportions of the general population experiencing daily tinnitus by GBD 
Study level of hearing impairment (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/
GlobalDALYmethods_2000_2011.pdf). Tinnitus prevalence estimates for 
each level of hearing impairment severity for the DALYs calculations were as 
follows: mild (18.40%); moderate (26.58%); moderately severe (28.61%); 
severe (55.79%); profound (56.42%); and complete (47.97%).

both sexes. Among all industries, 13% of noise-exposed 
workers had any impairment and 2% had moderate or worse 
impairment (Table 3). Workers with hearing impairment were 
represented in all industry sectors, with sharply decreasing 
numbers of workers with higher levels of impairment. 
The mining sector had the highest prevalence of workers 
with any impairment (17%) and with moderate or worse 
impairment (3%), followed by the construction sector (any 
impairment = 16%, moderate or worse impairment = 3%), 
and the manufacturing sector (14% and 2%). The public 
safety sector, which includes police protection, fire protection 
(including wildland firefighters), corrections, and ambulance 
services, had the lowest prevalence of workers with any 
impairment (7%).
Across all industries, 2.53 healthy years were lost 
annually per 1,000 noise-exposed workers (Table 3). Mild 
impairment accounted for 52% of all healthy years lost 
and moderate impairment accounted for 27%. Workers

in the mining and construction sectors lost 3.45 and 3.09 
healthy years per 1,000 workers, respectively. Overall, 
66% of the sample worked in the manufacturing sector 
and represented 70% of healthy years lost by all workers. 
Public safety workers lost 1.30 healthy years per 1,000 
workers, the fewest among all workers.
Discussion
Findings of increasing prevalence with age and a higher 
prevalence among males were expected and consistent with other 
research (2,4,8). Industry results highlight the high prevalence 
of hearing loss within the noise-exposed working population

and the need for continued prevention efforts, especially in 
the mining, construction, and manufacturing sectors. The 
proportion of mining sector employees exposed to hazardous 
noise (76%) was the highest in any sector (3), and studies have 
consistently indicated elevated risks for occupational hearing 
loss within this sector (2,4). Occupational hearing loss risks 
have also been established within the construction sector (2,4); 
however, current noise regulations do not require audiometric 
testing for construction workers (2). Without testing to identify 
workers losing their hearing, intervention might be delayed or 
might not occur. Although a comparatively smaller percentage 
of manufacturing workers are noise-exposed (37%), this sector 
accounts for the most noise-exposed workers in the United 
States (3), and, as expected, the largest number of workers with 
hearing impairment. Some manufacturing sub-sectors, such as 
wood product, apparel, and machinery manufacturing, have 
been found to have occupational hearing loss risks as high as 
those in the mining and construction sectors (4). Another study 
using earlier GBD Study hearing impairment definitions also 
found the heaviest burdens of hearing impairment were in the 
mining, construction, and manufacturing sectors, indicating the 
most healthy years were lost in these sectors (8).
Approximately 78% of the healthy years lost were attributable to 
mild or moderate hearing impairment. Preventing any occupational 
hearing loss is the best way to reduce worker hearing impairment 
over a lifetime, because even mild-to-moderate impairment during 
working years can culminate in more healthy years lost during 
retirement. Prevention also has short-term benefits; persons with 
even mild hearing loss experience reduced audibility (loudness), 
reduced dynamic range of hearing (the difference between the 
softest and loudest perceptible sounds), and increased listening 
fatigue (2). They also often experience difficulties understanding 
speech, especially in the presence of background noise (2). Other 
effects include degraded communication (2), cognitive decline 
(9), and depression (2).
In the general population, the prevalence of impairment also 
sharply decreases at higher levels of impairment, and severe 
impairment is not typically caused exclusively by noise. Some

 * Annual number of DALYs per 1,000 workers represent how many years of healthy life were lost by 1,000 workers each year and can be compared across different 
health conditions.
 † Hearing impairment severity audiometric definitions and lay descriptions are provided in Table 1. Hearing impairment was measured in the better ear.
 § DALYs were calculated by 1) applying the GBD Study disability weight with tinnitus to the number of workers estimated to have tinnitus; 2) applying the GBD Study 
disability weight without tinnitus to the number of workers estimated not to have tinnitus; and 3) adding these two values together for each industry sector 
and overall.
 ¶ Percent of total DALYs lost by all noise-exposed workers within each industry sector.
 ** The GBD Study did not calculate a disability weight for moderately severe hearing impairment. DALYs are presented as a range, applying the disability weight for 
moderate impairment to obtain the lower limit, and applying the disability weight for severe impairment to obtain the upper limit. The average of the lower and 
upper limits was used to calculate the total DALYs in each industry sector and overall.
 †† This estimate has a relative standard error ≥30% and <50% and should be used with caution as it does not meet standards of reliability/precision.
 §§ Estimate not shown as it has a relative standard error ≥50% and does not meet standards of reliability/precision.

away from noisy jobs because of difficulties communicating 
in noisy environments, or from jobs where hearing is critical 
for productivity and safety. For example, although the public 
safety sector had fewer older workers (lowering the prevalence), 
hearing impairment might have resulted in attrition because of 
the hearing-critical nature of many occupations in this sector (2).
The findings in this report are subject to at least seven 
limitations. First, this was a convenience sample and might 
not be representative of all noise-exposed workers tested in the 
United States. Second, not all noise-exposed workers are tested in 
the United States, especially in industries with high proportions 
of mobile or temporary workers, such as the construction 
and agriculture sectors. Third, in the absence of additional 
information, such as medical records, hearing impairment caused 
by occupational exposures can only be inferred. However, this 
inference was strengthened by studying exposed workers and 
excluding audiograms indicating nonoccupational exposures. 
Fourth, GBD Study disability weights were developed using 
international surveys asking respondents to compare life 
limitations posed by different health conditions, and to compare 
the value of preventing certain health conditions to the value of 
preventing death (5); respondents might not be able to appreciate 
the impact a disability can have on quality of life if they do not 
have that disability. Fifth, GBD Study audiometric definitions for 
impairment levels are conservative, with stringent requirements 
to reach even mild impairment. In addition, no impairment is 
identified when there is a total loss of hearing in one ear, and the 
impairment in the other ear can be lessened by hearing aid use. 
These limitations might have lowered impairment estimates, and 
worker impairment might be higher than reported here. Sixth, 
workers in the Occupational Hearing Loss Surveillance Project 
who wear hearing aids did not wear them during testing. However, 
few persons wear hearing aids during working years (9), so no 
adjustments were made for hearing aid use. Finally, no information 
was available on other conditions, so healthy years lost because 
of hearing impairment were not adjusted for comorbidities (5).
Occupational hearing loss is a permanent but entirely preventable 
condition with today’s hearing loss prevention strategies and 
technology (2). Concurrent with prevention efforts, early 
detection of hearing loss by consistent annual audiometric testing, 
and intervention to preclude further loss (e.g., refitting hearing 
protection, training), are critical. Although lost hearing cannot 
be recovered, workers can benefit from clinical rehabilitation, 
which includes fitting hearing aids, learning lip-reading, and 
adopting other compensation strategies to optimize hearing. Study 
results support beginning rehabilitation at a mild level of hearing 
impairment. Prevention, and early detection, intervention, and 
rehabilitation, might greatly improve workers’ quality of life (2,9).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Hearing loss is prevalent in the United States, especially among 
noise-exposed workers.
What is added by this report?
This is the first known study to quantify the disability-adjusted 
life years attributable to hearing impairment for noise-exposed 
U.S. workers, and to estimate the prevalence at each level of 
hearing impairment by industry sector.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Prevention, early detection, and intervention to preclude 
additional hearing loss are essential to reducing worker 
disability caused by hearing impairment.
