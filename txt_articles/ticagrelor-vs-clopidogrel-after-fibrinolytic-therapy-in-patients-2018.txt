IMPORTANCE The bleeding safety of ticagrelor in patients with ST-elevation myocardial
infarction treated with fibrinolytic therapy remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the short-term safety of ticagrelor when compared with clopidogrel
in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with fibrinolytic therapy.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label
with blinded end point adjudication trial that enrolled 3799 patients (younger than 75 years)
with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction receiving fibrinolytic therapy in 152 sites
from 10 countries from November 2015 through November 2017. The prespecified upper
boundary for noninferiority for bleeding was an absolute margin of 1.0%.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice
daily thereafter) or clopidogrel (300-mg to 600-mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter).
Patients were randomized with a median of 11.4 hours after fibrinolysis, and 90% were
pretreated with clopidogrel.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was thrombolysis in myocardial
infarction (TIMI) major bleeding through 30 days.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 58.0 (9.5) years, 2928 of 3799 patients (77.1%) were men,
and 2177 of 3799 patients (57.3%) were white. At 30 days, TIMI major bleeding had occurred
in 14 of 1913 patients (0.73%) receiving ticagrelor and in 13 of 1886 patients (0.69%) receiving
clopidogrel (absolute difference, 0.04%; 95% CI, −0.49% to 0.58%; P < .001 for
noninferiority). Major bleeding defined by the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes
criteria and by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium types 3 to 5 bleeding occurred in
23 patients (1.20%) in the ticagrelor group and in 26 patients (1.38%) in the clopidogrel group
(absolute difference, −0.18%; 95% CI, −0.89% to 0.54; P = .001 for noninferiority). The rates
of fatal (0.16% vs 0.11%; P = .67) and intracranial bleeding (0.42% vs 0.37%; P = .82) were
similar between the ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups, respectively. Minor and minimal
bleeding were more common with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel. The composite of death
from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 76 patients (4.0%) treated
with ticagrelor and in 82 patients (4.3%) receiving clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI,
0.67-1.25; P = .57).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients younger than 75 years with ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction, delayed administration of ticagrelor after fibrinolytic therapy was
noninferior to clopidogrel for TIMI major bleeding at 30 days.

 P
rimary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) rep-
resents the preferred reperfusion strategy for patients
with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
(STEMI).1,2 However, it is not possible for patients to be treated
at hospitals with PCI capabilities in a timely manner as di-
rected by clinical practice guidelines in many parts of the
world.3,4 As a result, many patients with STEMI receive fibri-
nolytic therapy as the initial reperfusion strategy.1-4 Two large-
scale randomized trials5,6 have established that dual antiplate-
let therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel reduces major
cardiovascular events in fibrinolytic-treated patients with
STEMI.
Ticagrelor, a reversible and direct-acting oral antagonist
oftheadenosinediphosphatereceptorP2Y12,7,8providesfaster,
greater, and more consistent P2Y12 inhibition than clopido-
grel. In the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO)
study,9 treatment with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel
significantly reduced the rate of death from vascular causes,
MI, or stroke without an increase in the rate of overall major
bleeding.
Despite these benefits, patients who received fibrinolytic
therapy in the preceding 24 hours were excluded. Accord-
ingly, to our knowledge, large-scale randomized trials evalu-
atingthesafetyandefficacyofticagrelorinthispopulationhave
not been performed. The main concern regarding the use of
ticagrelor in this scenario is related to the risk of major bleed-
ing,especiallyintracranialorfatalbleeding.Thesepatientswith
bleedingcomplicationshavegreaterratesofmajoradversecar-
diovascular events and mortality. Thus, the Ticagrelor in Pa-
tients With ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Treated With
Pharmacological Thrombolysis (TREAT) trial was conducted
to evaluate the safety of ticagrelor in this clinical setting.
Methods
Study Design Oversight
The trial protocol is available in Supplement 1 and the statis-
tical analysis plan is available in Supplement 2. Briefly, the
TREAT trial10 was an academically led, phase 3, interna-
tional, multicenter, randomized, and open-label study with
blinded outcome assessment that involved 10 countries (Ar-
gentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, New Zea-
land, Peru, Russia, and Ukraine). The steering committee, con-
sisting exclusively of academic members, designed and
oversaw the conduct of the trial. An independent data moni-
toring committee monitored the trial and had access to the un-
blinded data. Site management, data management, and analy-
sis were performed by the Research Institute–Heart Hospital,
São Paulo, Brazil. The study design was approved by the ap-
propriate national and institutional regulatory authorities and
ethics committees, and all participants provided written in-
formed consent.
Patients
Patients were eligible for enrollment if they presented within
24 hours after the onset of symptoms, had evidence of acute
ST-elevation on their qualifying electrocardiogram (at least 2
should be 1 mm in 2 contiguous peripheral or precordial leads
in men and 1.5-mm elevation in V1-V3 in women and 1-mm in
limb leads), were younger than 75 years, and received fibrino-
lytic therapy. Key exclusion criteria were any contraindica-
tion to the use of clopidogrel, use of oral anticoagulation
therapy, an increased risk of bradycardia, and concomitant
therapy with a strong cytochrome P-450 3A inhibitor or in-
ducer. The complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is
providedineMethods1ofSupplement3.Becausepatientswho
received fibrinolytic therapy in the previous 24 hours were ex-
cluded from the PLATO trial, we decided to include patients
within 24 hours of symptom onset to fill the literature gap.
Moreover, in an informal survey conducted with some poten-
tial sites before trial start, it was considered that establishing
a very narrow window from fibrinolytic therapy to random-
ization would make recruitment very challenging. That ap-
proach would demand that the trial be conducted in small re-
gional hospitals or mobile units, where the research
infrastructure and expertise is very limited in most of the par-
ticipating countries.
Randomization and Study Treatment
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1 to 1 ratio, to receive
ticagrelor with a loading dose of 180 mg or clopidogrel (with a
loading dose of 300 to 600 mg) as early as possible after the
index event and not more than 24 hours after the event. Ran-
domization was performed in a concealed fashion with the use
of an automated web-based system, in permuted blocks of 4,
stratified according to site. Patients pretreated with clopido-
grel before randomization were still eligible. If randomized to
ticagrelor, the trial loading dose was recommended, and if ran-
domized to clopidogrel, the patients could receive an addi-
tional 300 mg of clopidogrel at the discretion of the investi-
gator and in accordance to local guidelines if undergoing PCI.
Therandomizedmaintenancetherapyforticagrelorwas90mg
twice daily and for clopidogrel was 75 mg once daily.
All patients received acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), 75 to 100
mg daily, during all the follow-up unless intolerant. For pa-
tients not previously receiving ASA, a loading dose of 162 mg
to 325 mg was recommended. Investigators were encouraged
Key Points
Question In patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction
treated with fibrinolytic therapy, is ticagrelor noninferior to
clopidogrel with respect to thrombolysis in myocardial infarction
major bleeding at 30 days?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 3799 patients, delayed
administration of ticagrelor after fibrinolytic therapy was
noninferior to clopidogrel for thrombolysis in myocardial infarction
major bleeding at 30 days. However, minor bleeding was
increased with ticagrelor and there was no benefit on efficacy
outcomes.
Meaning Because most of the included patients were pretreated
with clopidogrel, these findings reflect mostly the noninferiority of
switching from clopidogrel to ticagrelor in patients already fully
loaded with clopidogrel.

 to practice evidence-based medicine and follow appropriate
guidelines1,2 in the other aspects of treating STEMI; decisions
about the use of other treatments for acute MI and subse-
quent revascularization procedures were left to the discre-
tion of the treating physicians.
Clinical Outcomes
The primary safety outcome was major bleeding, according to
the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) definition.
Secondary safety outcomes include major or minor bleeding
according to the PLATO trial9,11 and the Bleeding Academic Re-
search Consortium (BARC)12 definitions and clinically rel-
evant nonmajor bleeding or minor bleeding according to the
TIMI definition.
Exploratory secondary efficacy outcomes included the
compositeoutcomeofdeathfromvascularcauses,MI,orstroke
(similar to the PLATO primary outcome), and the same com-
posite outcome with the addition of recurrent ischemia, tran-
sient ischemic attack, or other arterial thrombotic events. We
evaluated individual components of the composite efficacy
outcomes and all-cause mortality at 30 days.
The primary and secondary outcomes were adjudicated
with the use of prespecified criteria by an independent clini-
cal events committee whose members were unaware of the
group assignments. Detailed definitions of outcomes are pro-
vided in eMethods 2 of Supplement 3.
Statistical Analysis
Concerns around major bleeding events were the main driver
for the choice of the primary outcome of TREAT trial and for
the noninferiority design. When TREAT was being designed,
to our knowledge, there were no reported trials of ticagrelor
in fibrinolytic-treated patients with STEMI that could inform
major bleeding rates. Thus, we based our sample size on pre-
vious trials of ticagrelor in patients with STEMI undergoing
PCI.13 In this regard, TIMI major bleeding rates at 30 days were
projected to be around 1.2%. We considered an increase of
bleeding of less than 1.0% to fulfill clinical criteria of nonin-
feriority, which reflects what others have used as evidence of
noninferiority regarding safety and efficacy outcomes, includ-
ing major bleeding and mortality, in patients with acute coro-
nary syndromes.14,15 We required a sample size of at least 1897
patients per group to provide greater than 90% statistical
power, considering a noninferiority (absolute) margin of 1.0%,
a 1-sided α of 2.5%, and assuming a 1 to 1 allocation ratio.
Continuous variables are reported as mean and standard
deviation, or medians and interquartile range (IQR) as appro-
priate. Categorical variables are summarized as frequencies.
Allpatientswhohadbeenrandomizedtoatreatmentgroup
were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. We also con-
ducted sensitivity analyses in the per protocol population as
prespecified in our statistical analysis plan (Supplement 2).
Bleeding events were compared between groups based on the
normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Efficacy
outcomes were analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional
hazards model. The point estimate and 2-sided 95% confi-
dence intervals for the hazard ratio were calculated for each
outcome. Prespecified safety and efficacy analyses were per-
formed in subgroups according to age, sex, Killip risk score,
diabetes mellitus, time from start of index event to random-
ization, aspirin, treatment with fibrin-specific or nonfibrin-
specific fibrinolytics, and use of clopidogrel before random-
ization. The rates of bleeding and efficacy events are reported
as percentages. All reported P values for noninferiority are
1-sided, and reported P values for superiority are 2-sided. All
analyses were performed with the use of R (R Programming).16
Results
Study Patients and Study Drugs
We recruited 3799 patients from 152 centers in 10 countries
from November 2015 through November 2017. The follow-up
period for the 30-day data ended in December 2017, when in-
formation on vital status was available for all patients except
8 (Figure 1). Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics. The
mean (SD) age was 58.0 (9.5) years, 2928 of 3799 patients
(77.1%) were men, 1759 of 3799 patients (46.3%) were current
smokers, and 328 of 3799 patients (8.6%) had a history of MI.
A total of 3795 of 3799 (99.9%) of the patients received fibri-
nolytic agent, of whom 2881 of 3799 (75.9%) received a fibrin-
specific agent. The 2 treatment groups were well balanced as
demonstrated by the baseline characteristics (Table 1) and the
nonstudymedicationsandprocedures(eTable1inSupplement
3). Both groups were randomized with a median of 2.6 hours
(IQR, 1.5-4.3 hours) from chest pain to fibrinolytic therapy and
had a median of 11.4 hours (IQR, 5.8-18.2 hours) after fibrino-
lytic therapy to randomization. In both groups, 3376 of 3774
patients (89.4%) received clopidogrel prior to randomiza-
tion, usually at the 300-mg dose. A total of 3755 of 3799 pa-
tients (98.8%) received aspirin. The overall rate of adherence
to the study drug at 30 days was 90.3%, as assessed by the site
investigators.

For most included patients, randomized treatment did not begin immediately
but rather hours after initiation of fibrinolytic therapy. In this sense, patients
randomized to ticagrelor received the first dose of ticagrelor several hours after
initiation of fibrinolytic therapy (median, 11.4 hours), and 90% were pretreated
with clopidogrel.

 Bleeding
The primary outcome (TIMI major bleeding up to 30 days) oc-
curred in 14 of 1913 patients (0.73%) in the ticagrelor group and
13 of 1886 patients (0.69%) in the clopidogrel group (absolute
difference, 0.04%; 95% CI, −0.49% to 0.58%; P < .001 for non-
inferiority) (Figure 2; eFigure 1 in Supplement 3). Results were
similar for the per protocol and other sensitivity analyses
(eTable2 in Supplement 3). Major bleeding as assessed by the
PLATO criteria and BARC types 3 to 5 bleeding occurred in 23
of1913patients(1.20%)intheticagrelorgroupandin26of1886
patients (1.38%) in the clopidogrel group (absolute differ-
ence, −0.18%; 95% CI, −0.89% to 0.54%; P = .001 for nonin-
feriority) (Figure 2; eFigures 2 and 3 in Supplement 3).
The rates of fatal bleeding (0.16% vs 0.11%; P = .67) and in-
tracranial bleeding (0.42% vs 0.37%; P = .82) were similar be-
tween the ticagrelor and the clopidogrel groups, respectively.
Minor and minimal bleeding, as well as total bleeding, were
more common with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel, irrespec-
tive of the classification used (Table 2).
In patients who received study drugs within 4 hours after
initiationoffibrinolytictherapy,theTIMImajorbleedingevents
rates were 1.53% and 1.22% for the ticagrelor and clopidogrel
groups,respectively(P = .73).Amongthesepatients,therewere
also no statistically significant differences between ticagre-
lor and clopidogrel with respect to PLATO major bleeding and
BARC types 3 to 5 bleeding rates (eFigure 4 in Supplement 3).
Efficacy
The exploratory secondary efficacy outcomes and interven-
tions up to 30 days are shown in Table 3. The composite out-
come of death from vascular causes, MI, or stroke occurred in
76 patients (4.0%) treated with ticagrelor and in 82 patients
(4.3%) receiving clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.67-
1.25; P = .57). The rates of individual outcomes of MI, stroke,
and other arterial thrombotic events were similar in the ti-
cagrelor and clopidogrel groups.
Other Adverse Events
Discontinuation of the study drug owing to serious adverse
events was similar between ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups
(0.40% vs 0.40%; P = .99). Dyspnea was more common in the
ticagrelor group than in the clopidogrel group (in 265 of 1913
patients [13.9%] vs 144 of 1886 patients [7.6%], respectively)
(eTable 3 in Supplement 3). Few patients discontinued the
study drug because of dyspnea (19 of 1913 patients [1.0%] in
the ticagrelor group and none in the clopidogrel group). The
frequencies of serious adverse events were similar between
groups.
Subgroup Analysis
The treatment effects of ticagrelor vs clopidogrel for the pri-
mary safety outcome and for the exploratory efficacy out-
come were consistent among all subgroups (eTables 4 and 5
in Supplement 3).
Discussion
In this trial of patients younger than 75 years with STEMI who
received fibrinolytic therapy as their initial reperfusion
strategy,1,2 delayed administration of ticagrelor was noninfe-
rior to clopidogrel with respect to major bleeding (according
to the TIMI, PLATO, and BARC classifications) at 30 days. Re-
sults were consistent between the intention-to-treat and per
protocol analyses. Importantly, the rates of fatal and intracra-
nialbleedingwerealsosimilarbetweentheticagrelorandclopi-

 Factorsthatcouldberelatedtothelowmajorbleedingrates
observedinourtrialincludetheexclusionofpatientsolderthan
75 years, the predominantly male population, and the rela-
tive low risk of included patients. In addition, despite the fact
thatweusedaverydetailedandstandardizedadjudicationpro-
cess, lower transfusion rates in some participating countries
could have decreased ascertainment of major bleeding events.
Nevertheless, the major bleeding rates found in TREAT are
similar to what was seen in the Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in
Myocardial Infarction Trial (COMMIT)5 trial, in which rates of
fatal, transfused, or intracranial bleeds together in fibrinolytic-
treated patients who received clopidogrel were 0.65%.
Limitations
Comparisons of safety event rates between TREAT and other
large-scale ticagrelor trials in patients with acute coronary syn-
dromesarelimitedowingtodifferencesinstudydesigns,popu-
lations, and follow-up. Nevertheless, in the PLATO STEMI11
analysis, intracranial bleeding was very rare and not different
between both groups (0.4% vs 0.2% in the ticagrelor and clopi-
dogrel groups, respectively). This finding is similar to the rates
observed in our trial. Given the observed low major bleeding
rates,anotherimportantlimitationofourtrialisthatonemight
consider our noninferiority margin of 1% to be quite wide and
reflective of the modest sample size. This margin was chosen
based on expert opinion and is similar to the margins used by
previous acute coronary syndromes trials,14,15 although trials
in populations similar to TREAT were not available at the time
the protocol was designed. On the other hand, the upper
boundaries of the confidence intervals for major bleeding ac-
cordingtodifferentclassificationswerealllowerthan0.6;thus,
far from the 1% prespecified margin. Finally, as in previous ti-
cagrelor trials, despite the fact that dyspnea was more com-
mon in patients receiving ticagrelor than clopidogrel, discon-
tinuation owing to this adverse event was uncommon in the
TREAT trial.
In our trial, rates of major cardiovascular events were simi-
lar between ticagrelor and clopidogrel at 30 days. Owing to the
low number of events, our statistical power to assess superi-
ority is limited; thus, these findings must be interpreted as ex-
ploratory. The lack of short-term differences between ticagre-
lor and clopidogrel is consistent with previous trials. In the
PLATO STEMI11 analysis (n = 7544), the effects on major car-
diovasculareventsappearedtoaccrueovertime,andtheevent
curves suggested that the bulk of the clinical benefit was ob-
tained during long-term treatment. Additionally, our results
might have been influenced, at least in part, by the stringent
criteria that used by the clinical classification committee for
outcomes, such as reinfarction, coupled with the challenge of
adjudicating some of these outcomes in the setting of STEMI
and rising biomarker levels.
The median time of thrombolytic administration to ran-
domization, as is true for previous smaller studies, was about
11 hours, which is beyond the half-life of fibrin-specific fibri-
nolytics. Thus, it is likely that patients who had early bleed-
ing events associated with fibrinolytic therapy were ex-
cluded. Nevertheless, in TREAT, we were still able to include
patients within the first 4 hours of receiving fibrinolytic
therapy. As expected, the TIMI major bleeding event rates at
30 days were higher (1.37% in both groups) in this subgroup
compared with patients who were randomized later. Al-
though our trial was not powered to determine noninferior-

 ity in specific subgroups, including patients who received ti-
cagrelor soon after fibrinolytic therapy, major bleeding rates
were numerically similar between groups irrespective of time
from fibrinolytic therapy to randomization. Our trial does not
address treatment of patients older than 75 years, who were
excluded.
Most patients in our trial received clopidogrel preran-
domization. In this regard, given that patients who received
fibrinolytic therapy in the previous 24 hours were excluded
from the PLATO trial and that STEMI guidelines2 recom-
mend that ticagrelor should only be initiated after 48 hours
after fibrinolysis, we believe that our trial adds new safety
information to practicing physicians. Furthermore, approxi-
mately 50% of patients in the PLATO trial also received
clopidogrel prior to randomization to either ticagrelor or
clopidogrel and bleeding risk in these patients appeared to
be comparable with those who had not received prior open-
label clopidogrel. Based on our findings, patients with
STEMI younger than 75 years who initially received clopido-
grel can be safely switched to ticagrelor in the first 24 hours
after fibrinolysis. Whether this strategy will result in fewer
cardiovascular events in the long term remains to be deter-
mined. Our trial was an investigator-initiated trial with lim-
ited funding that did not allow a double-dummy design. We
attempted to minimize the risk of bias associated with the
open-label nature of the study by performing blinded out-
come adjudication.
Conclusions
In patients younger than 75 years with STEMI, delayed admin-
istration of ticagrelor after fibrinolytic therapy was noninfe-
rior to clopidogrel for TIMI major bleeding at 30 days. How-
ever, minor bleeding was increased with ticagrelor, and there
was no benefit on efficacy outcomes.

Editor's Note
The TREAT Trial—Moving ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction
Care Forward, With More to Do
Clyde W. Yancy, MD, MSc; Robert A. Harrington, MD
Management of patients presenting with ST-elevation myo-
cardial infarction (STEMI) has been defined by data from large,
high-qualityrandomizedclinicaltrialsthathaveexaminedboth
medical and procedural therapies. Guideline-directed care
based on considerable evidence from these trials supports best
outcomes with prompt cul-
prit vessel revascularization
viapercutaneouscoronaryin-
tervention (PCI). But the realities of the management of STEMI
worldwide are characterized by differences in reperfusion
therapy and particularly marked variability in PCI use.1 Be-
cause lytic therapy remains a standard of care in much of the
world, especially in the 10 countries within the Ticagrelor in
Patients With ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Treated With
Pharmacological Thrombolysis (TREAT) trial,2 evaluating best
practices associated with improved outcomes becomes im-
portant. In the Study of Platelet Inhibition and Patient Out-
comes (PLATO) trial,3 which assessed both non-ST-elevation
acute coronary syndrome and STEMI treated with PCI, imme-
diate use of ticagrelor has been shown to be superior to clopi-
dogrel, albeit with higher bleeding risks.
