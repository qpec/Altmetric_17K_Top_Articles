O is a crucial physiological signaling molecule in diverse 
organ systems. NO is synthesized from L-arginine and 
molecular oxygen by a family of 3 NO synthases (NOSs): 
endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS), and induc-
ible NOS, which have distinct roles and functions.1 eNOS and 
nNOS are constitutively expressed isoforms named after the 
cell type in which they were first identified but are also present 
in other tissues. eNOS is particularly important in the cardio-
vascular system where it is involved in multiple homeostatic 
processes, including the endothelium-dependent regulation of 
vascular tone and blood flow, inhibition of platelet aggrega-
tion and adhesion, modulation of cardiac contraction, inhibi-
tion of vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and promotion 
of angiogenesis.1 nNOS is found in the central nervous sys-
tem, peripheral nerves (termed nitrergic nerves), and many 
other tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle.2
Although eNOS is well established to be of significant 
importance in cardiovascular physiology, it is increasingly 
evident from animal studies that nNOS is also involved in the 
regulation of cardiovascular function and exerts effects that 
in general are distinct from those of eNOS.1,3 Several studies 
using nNOS-selective inhibitors or nNOS-deficient mice sug-
gested that nNOS-derived NO exerts central effects on blood 
pressure (BP) by regulating sympathetic outflow, although 
some studies in nNOS knockout mice reported no effect on 
BP.3,4 nNOS may also influence BP by modulating renal renin 
release and fluid balance.5 nNOS in nitrergic nerves modu-
lates vessel tone at a local level in several vascular beds, which 
could potentially impact on BP.3 Other experimental studies 
indicate an important role for nNOS in regulating changes in 
heart rate (HR) mediated by baroreflex responses.6 Finally, 
nNOS regulates cardiac excitation–contraction coupling in 
mice, in particular influencing myocardial relaxation and the 
response to β-adrenergic stimulation.7
These studies suggest that nNOS may have an important 
role in regulating the cardiovascular system, but this possibil-
ity has not been directly investigated in humans. We previ-
ously reported studies in which an nNOS-selective inhibitor, 
Abstract—NO is physiologically generated by endothelial and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) isoforms. Although 
nNOS was first identified in brain, it is expressed in other tissues, including perivascular nerves, cardiac and skeletal 
muscle. Increasing experimental evidence suggests that nNOS has important effects on cardiovascular function, but its 
composite effects on systemic hemodynamics in humans are unknown. We undertook the first human study to assess 
the physiological effects of systemic nNOS inhibition on basal hemodynamics. Seventeen healthy normotensive men 
aged 24±4 years received acute intravenous infusions of an nNOS-selective inhibitor, S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline, and 
placebo on separate occasions. An initial dose-escalation study showed that S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (0.1–3.0 µmol/
kg) induced dose-dependent changes in systemic hemodynamics. The highest dose of S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (3.0 
µmol/kg over 10 minutes) significantly increased systemic vascular resistance (+42±6%) and diastolic blood pressure 
(67±1 to 77±3 mm Hg) when compared with placebo (both P<0.01). There were significant decreases in heart rate 
(60±4 to 51±3 bpm; P<0.01) and left ventricular stroke volume (59±6 to 51±6 mL; P<0.01) but ejection fraction was 
unaltered. S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline had no effect on radial artery flow-mediated dilatation, an index of endothelial NOS 
activity. These results suggest that nNOS-derived NO has an important role in the physiological regulation of basal 
systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure in healthy humans.  (Hypertension. 2017;69:970-976. DOI: 10.1161/

S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (SMTC), was infused locally into 
the brachial artery or coronary artery of healthy humans. 
Local infusion of SMTC reduced basal blood flow both in 
the forearm and coronary circulations without affecting the 
eNOS-mediated vasodilator response to acetylcholine, sub-
stance P, or increased shear stress.8,9 Additional studies showed 
that local infusion of SMTC inhibited mental stress–induced 
increases in forearm blood flow but had no effect on pacing-
induced increases in coronary blood flow.8,10 These findings 
suggest that nNOS-derived NO contributes to the tonic regu-
lation of human microvascular tone, at least in the coronary 
and forearm skeletal muscle vascular beds. Previous studies 
in which the nonselective NOS inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-
l-arginine (L-NMMA), was infused systemically in humans 
reported a transient pressor response.11–13 However, the poten-
tial contribution of nNOS-derived NO cannot be ascertained 
from these studies because L-NMMA inhibits all NOS iso-
forms. The aim of this study was to undertake the first direct 
investigation in healthy humans of the hemodynamic effects 
of systemic nNOS inhibition.
Methods
The study conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of 
Helsinki and received local Research Ethics Committee and Research 
Governance approval. The study protocol was submitted to the UK 
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and was not 
classed as a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product 
(CTIMP). However, given that SMTC had not previously been admin-
istered systemically (intravenously) to humans, studies were initiated 
with a no-effect dose, and appropriate safety checks were performed. 
All participants provided written informed consent. We studied 17 
lean healthy male subjects aged 24±4 years, who were recruited by 
advertisement. No subject had a history of smoking, recreational drug 
use, excessive alcohol intake, or use of over the counter medicines 
over the previous 3 months. All underwent clinical screening, ECG, 
and blood hematology and biochemistry profiles to exclude hyper-
lipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, renal, and liver disease. 
Participants were instructed to abstain from caffeine and alcohol for 
at least 12 hours before studies.
SMTC Dosing and Protocol
Our previous studies with local intra-arterial administration showed 
that SMTC is ≈10-fold more potent than L-NMMA at increas-
ing basal forearm vascular resistance.8 Previous studies in which 
L-NMMA was administered systemically (intravenously) reported 
a 30% to 40% increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with 
doses of 12 to 24 µmol/kg (bolus over 5 minutes).12,13 We therefore 
chose a maximum dose of SMTC that was ≈10-fold lower, that is, 3 
µmol/kg. We calculated the total SMTC dose that we had previously 
used in local intra-arterial infusion studies8–10 (0.1 µmol/kg) and used 
this as a starting point for an ascending dose study. All SMTC doses 
were administered over 10 minutes into a large antecubital vein.
Each SMTC dose or placebo was administered on a separate occa-
sion at least a week apart. In the first 3 subjects, we assessed escalat-
ing single intravenous doses of SMTC (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 µmol/
kg) and 1 placebo dose (saline vehicle) randomized in relation to 
visits in which rising doses of SMTC were administered. The next 
6 subjects received SMTC (1.0 and 3.0 µmol/kg) and a randomized 
placebo dose. The final 8 subjects received SMTC (3.0 µmol/kg) and 
placebo in random order. Therefore, 9 subjects received SMTC 1.0 
and 3.0 µmol/kg, and all 17 subjects received SMTC 3.0 µmol/kg. 
The individuals undertaking hemodynamic and other measurements 
were blinded to the treatment (except in the case of the first 3 subjects 
for safety reasons). Participants returned for clinical review, and for 
repeat hematology, renal and liver profiles 3 to 5 days after each dose 
of SMTC.
Hemodynamic Assessment
All studies were undertaken in a quiet temperature-controlled vas-
cular laboratory after at least 30 minutes of supine rest. A 16-gauge 
cannula was inserted into a large antecubital vein for infusions. The 
ECG was continuously monitored. HR and BP were measured using 
a standard oscillometric method. Left ventricular (LV) stroke volume 
was measured by 3-dimensional echocardiography in the last 8 sub-
jects. SVR was calculated as mean arterial pressure (MAP) divided 
by cardiac output (CO). Measurements of hemodynamic parameters 
were made every 5 minutes for 15 minutes after completion of SMTC 
infusion and then every 30 minutes for 3 hours.
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed according to 
American Society of Echocardiography guidelines,14 using a Vivid 7 
system (GE Medical, United Kingdom) with 2.5 MHz matrix array 
and stand-alone transducers. For 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiogra-
phy, full-volume data sets were obtained from the apical 4-chamber 
window over 4 consecutive cardiac cycles and analyzed offline. LV 
stroke volume and ejection fraction were calculated offline using 
semiautomated border tracking in 3 orthogonal views. All echocar-
diography acquisition and data analyses were performed by an expe-
rienced operator who was blinded to interventions.
Flow-Mediated Dilatation
To assess whether SMTC might be affecting eNOS-dependent 
responses, we quantified radial artery flow-mediated dilatation 
(FMD) as described previously9 in the final 8 subjects who received 
SMTC (3.0 µmol/kg) and placebo. In brief, images of the radial 
artery were acquired using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound with a 
7-MHz linear array transducer (Acuson Aspen Advanced Imagegate). 
A BP cuff 5 to 10 cm distal to the transducer was inflated to at least 
50 mm Hg above systolic pressure for 5 minutes, followed by release 
to induce reactive hyperemia. FMD was measured at baseline before 
any infusions and then again immediately after the completion of the 
SMTC infusion (which was found to be the time point of maximal 
hemodynamic response). All scanning and FMD analysis was per-
formed by an experienced operator who was blinded to interventions.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean± SEM. Comparisons were made by 
repeated measures ANOVA or 2-tailed paired t test as appropriate. P 
value <0.05 was considered significant.
Results
The administration of SMTC did not result in any significant 
clinical or other adverse effects. SMTC doses of 0.1 and 0.3 
µmol/kg, which were tested in 3 subjects, seemed to have no 
effect on HR or BP. This was expected on the basis of previous 
studies with local intra-arterial infusion of SMTC, where no 
effect on BP was found.8,9
Dose-Dependent Effect of SMTC on BP
SMTC (1.0 and 3.0 µmol/kg) had dose-dependent hemody-
namic effects when compared with placebo infusion. It sig-
nificantly increased diastolic BP and MAP, whereas HR was 
significantly decreased (n=9; each P<0.01; Figure 1; Table). 
There was no significant effect on systolic BP. The maximal 
response to SMTC was observed 10 minutes after initiation 
of infusion, and the changes in HR and BP gradually returned 
to baseline over the next 30 to 60 minutes. The time course of 
changes in HR and diastolic BP is illustrated in Figure 2.

Effect of SMTC (3.0 µmol/kg) on Hemodynamics 
and Cardiac Function
All 17 study participants received the highest dose of SMTC, 
while in 8 subjects we also performed 3D echocardiography to 
assess cardiac function. In these subjects, changes in HR and 
BP were similar to those in the first 9 subjects, with diastolic BP 
increasing by 10±2 mm Hg (P<0.001) and MAP by 7±2 mm Hg 
(P<0.01), whereas HR was reduced by 6±1 bpm (P<0.01). The 
SMTC-induced changes in echocardiographic measures of car-
diac function are shown in Figure 3. There was a significant 
decrease in LV stroke volume (−14±3%; P<0.01), related to an 
increase in LV end-systolic volume with no change in LV end-
diastolic volume. The increase in MAP and the decrease in CO 
were associated with an increase in SVR of 42±6% (P<0.001) 
when compared with placebo. Ejection fraction and LV stroke 
work, however, were not altered by SMTC (data not shown).
Effect of SMTC (3.0 µmol/kg) on FMD
In 8 subjects, we compared the effects of SMTC (3.0 µmol/
kg) or placebo on FMD, an index of eNOS-dependent 
vasodilatation.1 Neither SMTC nor placebo infusion had any 
significant effect on baseline radial artery diameter or on FMD 
(Figure 4).
Serum SMTC Concentration
Serum concentrations of SMTC were undetectable at base-
line. However, 20 minutes after administration of a dose of 
3.0 µmol/kg, shortly after the time of maximal effect on BP, 
the mean serum concentration was 80.5±10.8 ng/mL (≈0.29 
µmol/L) and declined to 22.8±3.9 ng/mL after 1 hour (n=7).
Discussion
Our previous first-in-human studies with the nNOS-selec-
tive inhibitor SMTC indicated that nNOS has a major role 
in the basal regulation of microvascular tone in the forearm 
and coronary circulations, whereas eNOS mediates relaxant 
responses to pharmacological and shear stress stimuli.8,9 We 
have now undertaken the first human studies to assess the 
integrated hemodynamic effects of systemic nNOS-selective 
inhibition with SMTC in healthy subjects. We found that

SMTC induces a significant increase in SVR and BP and 
a reduction in HR and stroke volume. The highest dose of 
SMTC that was studied (3 µmol/kg) increased SVR by over 
40%, whereas LV stroke volume was reduced by about 15%. 
This dose of SMTC was expected to be nNOS-selective based 
on our previous human studies with local infusion, in which 
the archetypal eNOS-mediated responses of FMD or acetyl-
choline-induced vasodilation were unaffected by SMTC.8,9 
Indeed, we confirmed the lack of effect of systemic SMTC on 
FMD in this study, consistent with a previous study in which 
local brachial artery infusion of SMTC reduced forearm 
blood flow but had no effect on radial artery diameter or radial 
artery FMD.9 Furthermore, the measured serum concentra-
tion of SMTC at the time of peak hemodynamic effect was 
≈0.29 µmol/L, which is significantly below the level at which 
any significant eNOS inhibition might occur.15,16 Previous 
studies demonstrated the selectivity of SMTC for nNOS over 
eNOS, not only in rodent tissues but also in assays with the 
human enzymes.15
The magnitude of effect of systemic SMTC on BP and 
SVR was broadly similar to results previously observed 
with the use of systemic nonselective NOS inhibition with

L-NMMA.11–13 However, our maximum dose of SMTC was 
≤8× smaller than the dose of L-NMMA that caused simi-
lar hemodynamic effects,13 an approximate dose ratio which 
has been shown to be nNOS selective in forearm studies.8 
Taken together, these considerations imply that a major com-
ponent of the systemic hemodynamic effects of L-NMMA 
in healthy men may in fact be related to the inhibition of 
nNOS rather than eNOS. Our findings are also consistent 
with previous animal studies in which different nNOS-selec-
tive inhibitors increased BP in rats in vivo.5,16 However, our 
findings with regard to the physiological regulation of BP 
by nNOS rather than eNOS differ from those inferred from 
genetically modified murine models in which eNOS but not 
nNOS knockout mice are hypertensive.1,17 Interestingly, a 
human study that used systemic infusion of a different non-
selective NOS inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester 
(L-NAME), reported a much larger increase in BP than that 
observed with L-NMMA.18 In this study, we did not assess 
the maximal response to SMTC (because we wished to avoid 
the possibility of concurrent eNOS inhibition). Therefore, it 
is possible that the maximal physiological nNOS-dependent 
effect on BP could be higher than was observed in the cur-
rent study.
Among the first to use systemic L-NMMA in humans 
were Haynes et al,12 who found that L-NMMA infused sys-
temically at a dose of 3 mg/kg over 5 minutes produced 
an increase in diastolic BP and MAP of ≈7 mm Hg, with a 
decrease in HR of 14 bpm, when compared with placebo. No 
significant increase in SBP was observed in their study. Using 
a noninvasive bioimpedance method, they found that cardiac 
index decreased by 25±4% and SVR increased by 46±12%. 
Stamler et al11 used invasive measurement of BP and CO 
(Fick method) during systemic infusion of L-NMMA (3 mg/
kg over 3 minutes) and observed a 15% increase in MAP and 
a 63% increase in SVR. These previous results support the 
notion that NO influences SVR through the local regulation of 
vascular tone and thereby alters BP. This study suggests that 
a substantial component of the above effects may be attribut-
able to inhibition of nNOS rather than eNOS. On the basis of 
our previous studies of the effects of local intra-arterial infu-
sion of SMTC on microvascular tone,8,9 a major mechanism 
through which systemic SMTC acts to raise BP is likely to 
be the inhibition of nNOS in the microvasculature. We have 
suggested that the local vasodilator action of nNOS may be 
the result of NO release from perivascular nitrergic nerves, 
as in published animal studies.3 It has also been suggested 
that nNOS may release hydrogen peroxide when the levels of 
its substrate L-arginine are nonsaturating19; because hydro-
gen peroxide is a vasodilator in the microvasculature, this 
could be another underlying mechanism. In addition to local 
microvascular effects, a significant component of the action 
of nNOS on BP may involve central effects on sympathetic 
outflow.3,4 In previous human studies using L-NAME, it was 
suggested that 40% of the pressor effect may be central,18 
consistent with other studies suggesting that NO is involved 
in the central regulation of sympathetic outflow in humans.20 
Finally, animal studies suggest that an effect of nNOS-
derived NO on renal renin release could also be important in 
BP regulation.5 Additional studies will be required to define 
the relative contributions of these different mechanisms in the 
pressor effects of SMTC.
The decrease in HR and CO observed during SMTC 
infusion could have several explanations. The most straight-
forward reason for a decrease in CO is the increase in SVR 
(ie, increased afterload). It is also possible that the increase 
in BP initiates a baroreceptor reflex resulting in withdrawal 
of sympathetic efferent activity and augmentation of vagal 
activity, causing a decrease in HR and CO.21 Stamler et al11 
suggested that the effects of L-NMMA on HR and CO could 
not be explained solely by the increase in BP because simi-
lar changes in BP induced by the α1-adrenergic receptor 
agonist, phenylephrine, did not cause an equivalent decrease 
in CO. These authors, therefore, postulated that there might 
also be direct cardiac effects or specific effects of NO on 
sympathetic outflow. On the other hand, Hansen et al22 
found that systemic infusion of either L-NMMA or phenyl-
ephrine caused similar increases in BP and similar reduction 
in HR and sympathetic nerve activity, suggesting that the 
effects of L-NMMA on HR and CO might be secondary to 
changes in BP. A direct cardiac effect of SMTC might be 
possible; however, nNOS-derived NO is known to have a 
negative inotropic effect in vivo in the mouse and in isolated 
cardiomyocytes.7,23 We found no changes in ejection frac-
tion, suggesting a lack of major impact of SMTC on basal 
LV systolic function. However, analysis of contractile func-
tion by higher-fidelity methods (eg, pressure-volume analy-
sis) would be required to make definitive conclusions. In 
addition, previous animal work suggests that nNOS-derived 
NO specifically affects diastolic function and β-adrenergic 
inotropic responsiveness.24 Additional studies are, therefore, 
required to assess whether nNOS-derived NO has similar 
effects in the human heart.

The results of this study may have potential clinical impli-
cations. The hallmark of essential hypertension is an increase 
in peripheral vascular resistance. However, eNOS-stimulated 
responses have been shown to be relatively preserved in patients 
with essential hypertension when compared with patients with 
other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as diabetes 
mellitus and hypercholesterolemia.25,26 Our findings provide a 
potential explanation for this discrepancy and raise the impor-
tant question of whether nNOS dysfunction is an important 
contributor to hypertension. In this regard, we have recently 
shown that mental stress–induced vasodilatation in the forearm, 
a response shown to be mediated at least in part by local nNOS-
derived NO, is impaired in many patients with hypertension.27 
Another clinical scenario in which the impact of nNOS dysfunc-
tion merits investigation is chronic heart failure, which is char-
acterized by a significant increase in SVR. Patients with heart 
failure have a decreased vasomotor response to intracoronary 
L-NMMA, suggesting that basal release of NO in the coronary 
circulation is reduced in these patients,28 and this might involve 
a decrease in nNOS-derived NO based on our previous work 
in the human coronary circulation.9 Furthermore, patients with 
chronic heart failure also had enhanced inotropic responses to 
β-adrenergic agonists after intracoronary L-NMMA.29
Study Limitations
This study was performed in healthy young men and should 
be replicated in other groups, including subjects with cardio-
vascular risk factors. No definitive conclusions can be made 
about the direct effects of nNOS-derived NO on cardiac func-
tion or autonomic function based on this study. Additional 
studies designed to specifically address these aspects and to 
define the relative impact of central versus peripheral nNOS 
inhibition would be valuable. Evidence that SMTC exerts spe-
cific effects solely on NOS was based on the lack of effect on 
FMD, a prototypic eNOS-mediated response. Possible effects 
of SMTC on the hyperemic blood flow stimulus to FMD could 
have influenced the FMD response but would have tended to 
bias toward a reduction in FMD. Should other specific inhibi-
tors of nNOS become available for human use, studies should 
be undertaken with such agents to confirm the current data.
Perspectives
Although the physiological effects of nNOS have been exten-
sively studied in animals, no previous human studies have 
addressed the impact of nNOS on the regulation of systemic 
hemodynamics and BP. Here, we report the first human stud-
ies to investigate the integrated hemodynamic effects of nNOS 
inhibition. Our results indicate that nNOS has an important 
role in the physiological regulation of SVR and BP in healthy 
humans. The precise site(s) of nNOS action through which 
these effects are mediated require further investigation. The 
current work provides a foundation for future studies to inves-
tigate whether nNOS dysfunction is implicated in disease 
states in which systemic hemodynamics are altered.

What Is New?
• A neuronal NO synthase (nNOS)–selective inhibitor, S-methyl-L-thioc-
itrulline, was tested systemically for the first time in humans.
• Intravenous S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline infusion elevates blood pressure in 
healthy men.
What Is Relevant?
• nNOS has an important role in the physiological regulation of human 
systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.
• The site(s) of nNOS action involved in these effects require further study.
Summary
This is the first study to identify a physiological role for nNOS in 
regulating human blood pressure. S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline may 
be a useful tool to investigate the impact of nNOS dysfunction in 
disease.
