The  aim  of this
 article  is to  investigate
 the  association
 between
 corruption
 and  antibiotic
 use
at
 sub-national
 level.  We  explore
 the  correlation
 between,
 on  the  one  hand,
 two  measures
of
 corruption
 (prevalence
 of  corruption
 in  the  health
 sector  and  prevalence
 of
 bribes
 in
the
 society)
 at
 regional
 level  from  the  European
 Quality
 of  Government
 Index;  and,  on
the
 other,
 the consumption
 of  antibiotics  in  those
 European
 regions
 from  a
 2009  Special
Euro
 Barometer.
 In a multivariate
 regression
 model,
 we  control  for  potential
 confounders:
purchasing
 power  of  standardized
 regional  gross  domestic
 product,
 inhabitants
 per  medical
doctor
 and  age-standardized
 all-cause
 mortality
 rates.  We
 find  that  there  is a  strong  positive
association
 between
 both  measures
 of
 corruption
 (i.e.  in  the  health
 sector,  and  in  the  society
at
 large)  and  antibiotics
 use;  and  that this  association
 is  robust  to  the  introduction
 of  the
control
 variables.
 These
 results  support
 previous
 findings
 in  the  literature
 linking
 corruption
to
 higher  antibiotic
 use  at  cross-national
 level.  We  show  that  corruption
 does  seem  to
account
 for  some
 of the  remarkable
 between-region
 variation
 in
 antibiotic
 consumption
 in
Europe.

 Background
Antibiotic
 resistance
 –
 an
 unavoidable
 side
 effect
 of
 the
consumption
 of
 antibiotics
 –
 is
 one
 of
 the
 greatest
 global
challenges
 to
 public
 health.
 Increasing
 bacterial
 resistance
to
 existing
 antibiotics
 causes
 substantial
 morbidity
 and
mortality
 and
 increases
 health
 care
 and
 societal
 costs.
 As
the
 World
 Health
 Organization
 (WHO)
 points
 out,
 “a
 post-
antibiotic
 era—in
 which
 common
 infections
 and
 minor
injuries
 can
 kill—far
 from
 being
 an
 apocalyptic
 fantasy,
 is
instead
 a
 very
 real
 possibility
 for
 the
 21
 st
 century”
 [1].
 In
Europe
 alone,
 antimicrobial
 resistance
 is
 estimated
 to
 cause
25,000
 deaths
 each
 year
 and
 result
 in
 related
 costs
 of
 over
D
 1.5
 billion
 in
 healthcare
 expenses
 and

tivity
 [2]
 while,
 in
 the
 US,
 it
 is
 estimated
 to
 cause
 2
 million
illnesses
 and
 23,000
 deaths
 per
 year
 [3].
 If
 resistance
 is
 left
unchecked,
 a
 conservative
 estimate
 is
 that
 by
 2050
 an
 addi-
tional
 10
 million
 people
 are
 expected
 to
 die
 every
 year
 and
the
 cumulative
 cost
 −
 among
 other,
 increased
 complica-
tions,
 waste,
 lengthier
 hospital
 stays
 and
 the
 development
of
 more
 expensive
 drugs
 −
 will
 be
 more
 than
 one
 and
 a
 half
times
 annual

 Gross
 Domestic
 Product
 today
 (GDP)
[4].
 In
 other
 words,
 “rarely
 has
 modern
 medicine
 faced
 such
a
 grave
 threat”
 [5].
There
 is
 a
 recognition
 that
 limiting
 antibacterial
 resis-
tance
 is
 far
 from
 just
 a
 medical
 concern
 but
 rather
 a
behavioural
 and
 social
 problem.
 Since
 consumption
 of
antibiotics
 is
 considered
 to
 be
 the
 main
 driver
 of
 the
development
 of
 antibacterial
 resistance
 [6],
 large-scale
behavioural
 change
 in
 relation
 to
 antibiotic
 consumption
is
 urgently
 called
 upon.

In
 a
 European
 perspective,
 there
 is
 a
 huge
 variation
 in
outpatient
 antibiotic
 consumption,
 variation
 in
 the
 class
 of
antibiotics,
 dosage
 and
 treatment
 duration,
 and
 variation
 in
the
 quality
 of
 outpatient
 antibiotic
 consumption
 between
European
 countries
 [6–11].
 This
 variation
 is
 unlikely
 to
 be
the
 result
 of
 differences
 in
 the
 frequency
 of
 bacterial
 infec-
tions
 [6].
 Take
 for
 instance
 Belgium
 and
 the
 Netherlands,
which
 exhibit
 remarkable
 differences
 in
 antibiotic
 use,
with
 the
 former
 using
 them
 to
 a
 much
 larger
 extent
 than
the
 latter.
What
 could
 possibly
 account
 for
 this
 heterogeneity?
Some
 researchers
 emphasize
 differences
 in
 regulatory
practices
 and
 healthcare
 systems
 [6,7,12]
 while
 for
 others
it
 is
 ineffective
 healthcare
 systems
 and
 poor
 enforcement
of
 regulations
 what
 might
 explain
 the
 widespread
 non-
prescription
 sales
 of
 antibiotics
 that
 are
 prevalent
 in
 many
European
 countries
 [6].
 There
 is
 also
 a
 growing
 litera-
ture
 exploring
 the
 effects
 of
 corruption
 on
 health
 care
[13,14]. A
 pioneering
 analysis
 of
 a
 panel
 data
 set
 includ-
ing
 28
 European
 countries
 found
 that
 “corruption
 is
 the
main
 socioeconomic
 factor
 that
 explains
 antibiotics
 resis-
tance”
 [15],
 leading
 the
 authors
 to
 conclude
 that
 addressing
corruption
 and
 improving
 governance
 will
 lead
 to
 a
 reduc-
tion
 in
 resistance
 to
 antibiotics.
 Moreover,
 a
 report
 from
the
 European
 Commission
 (2013,
 p.
 146)
 explicitly
 brings
up
 increased
 antimicrobial
 resistance
 as
 possibly
 being
 the
result
 of
 improper
 market
 relations,
 since
 promotion
 of
pharmaceutical
 products
 create
 loyalty
 and
 may
 trigger
over-medicalization
 [16].
However,
 the
 literature
 linking
 corruption
 and
 antibi-
otics
 abuse
 has
 not
 taken
 into
 consideration
 sub-national
differences.
 And
 we
 know
 from
 other
 studies
 that
 there
are
 both
 very
 large
 within-state
 variations
 in
 levels
 of
 cor-
ruption
 [17]
 and
 consumption
 of
 antibiotics
 [11,18].
 For
example,
 there
 are
 pronounced
 differences
 across
 regions
within
 the
 same
 country,
 such
 as
 the
 very
 high
 levels
of
 antibiotic
 consumption
 in
 Spain’s
 Catalonia
 (or
 Italy’s
Lazio)
 and
 the
 moderate
 levels
 in
 Spain’s
 Basque
 Coun-
try
 (or
 Italy’s
 Tuscany).
 The
 picture
 emerging
 from
 these
findings
 is
 thus
 more
 nuanced
 than
 the
 conventional
 view
that
 the
 rates
 of
 antibiotic
 use
 and
 resistance
 “remain
 low
in
 northern
 European
 countries”
 while
 “reaching
 alarming
levels
 in
 Southern
 and
 Central
 Europe”
 [6].
In
 general,
 the
 aim
 of
 this
 paper
 is
 to
 provide
 a
 more
detailed
 map
 of
 the
 relationship
 between
 corruption
 and
antibiotic
 consumption—by
 examining
 over
 100
 European
regions
 instead
 of
 countries.
 Despite
 causality
 cannot
 be
established
 in
 a
 cross-sectional
 study
 like
 the
 one
 pre-
sented
 here,
 our
 findings
 do
 indeed
 question
 the
 validity
 of
national-level
 explanations
 of
 both
 corruption
 and
 antibi-
otics
 use,
 either
 institutional
 (e.g.
 the
 national
 health
 care
system)
 or
 cultural
 (e.g.
 the
 national
 language).
In
 particular,
 the
 goal
 of
 this
 paper
 is
 to
 investigate
the
 association
 between
 two
 regional
 measures
 of
 cor-
ruption
 –
 prevalence
 of
 corruption
 in
 the
 health
 sector
and
 prevalence
 of
 bribes
 in
 the
 society
 –
 and
 consump-
tions
 of
 antibiotics
 in
 the
 European
 regions.
 This
 paper
 uses
novel
 data
 from
 the
 European
 Quality
 of
 Government
 Index
[17]
 that
 collect
 perceptions
 of
 the
 prevalence
 of
 bribes
in
 the
 public
 sector
 in
 general
 and
 the
 prevalence
 of
 cor-
ruption
 in
 the
 health
 sector
 in
 regions
 of
 Europe.
 The
 data
shows
 a
 strong
 bivariate
 association
 between
 these
 mea-
sures
 of
 corruption
 at
 the
 regional
 level
 and
 consumption
 of
antibiotics
 in
 European
 regions—with
 data
 from
 a
 special
2009
 Euro-Barometer
 survey
 on
 antibiotic
 consumption.
When
 controlling
 in
 multivariate
 regression
 models
 for
multiple
 confounders
 –
 e.g.
 purchasing-power
 standard-
ized
 regional
 GDP
 per
 capita,
 inhabitants
 per
 medical
doctor,
 age-standardized
 mortality
 rates
 –
 the
 associations
between
 regional
 corruption
 and
 antibiotic
 consumption
remain
 persistent
 and
 strong.

 Methods
2.1.
 Independent
 variables
We  test
 proxies
 for
 both
 indicators
 of
 corruption:
 the
perception
 of
 corruption
 in
 the
 healthcare
 sector;
 and
 cit-
izens’
 reported
 experience
 of
 bribery.
 Data
 come
 from
 a
survey
 data
 of
 about
 85,000
 EU
 citizens
 distributed
 in
 all
the
 206
 NUTS-1
 and
 NUTS-2
 (Nomenclature
 des
 Unite´
ıs
Territoriales
 Statistiques)
 regions
 in
 Europe.
 Making
 use
 of
telephone
 interviews
 in
 the
 local
 language
 of
 each
 region,
randomly
 drawn
 respondents
 18
 years
 of
 age
 or
 older
 were
asked
 questions
 relating
 to
 Quality
 of
 Government
 on
 the
one
 hand
 and
 questions
 about
 demographics
 on
 the
 other.
The
 survey
 was
 administered
 beginning
 in
 February
 2013
and
 sampled
 400
 or
 more
 respondents
 in
 each
 region.
 The
robustness
 and
 external
 validity
 of
 the
 data
 have
 been
 ver-
ified
 thoroughly
 [17].
To
 measure
 the
 perception
 of
 corruption
 in
 the
 health-
care
 sector,
 respondents
 were
 asked
 to
 rate
 on
 a
 10-point
scale
 the
 extent
 to
 which
 they
 agreed
 or
 disagreed
 with
 the
following
 statement:
 ‘Corruption
 is
 prevalent
 in
 the
 pub-
lic
 healthcare
 system
 in
 my  area’
 (agree/disagree
 0–10).
 In
the
 empirical
 analysis,
 higher
 scores
 indicate
 lower
 lev-
els
 of
 healthcare
 sector
 corruption.
 To
 measure
 citizens’
reported
 experience
 with
 bribery,
 the
 following
 question
was
 asked:
 ‘In
 your
 opinion,
 how
 often
 do
 you
 think
 other
citizens
 in
 your
 area
 use
 bribery
 to
 obtain
 public
 services?’
Respondents
 were
 asked
 to
 answer
 on
 a
 10-point
 scale
(never/often
 0–10).
 In
 the
 empirical
 analysis,
 higher
 scores
indicate
 higher
 levels
 of
 bribery.
 The
 indicators
 of
 percep-
tions
 of
 corruption
 in
 the
 healthcare
 sector
 and
 perceptions
of
 the
 prevalence
 of
 bribes
 in
 the
 society
 were
 aggregated
from
 the
 individual
 level
 to
 the
 regional
 level
 as
 the
 mean
score.
 The
 indicators
 are
 highly
 but
 far
 from
 perfectly
 cor-
related
 (Pearson’s
 R
 0.7430).
 This
 signifies
 that,
 although
related,
 the
 indicators
 seem
 to
 measure
 different
 aspects
 of
corruption.
 To
 increase
 comparability,
 the
 measures
 were
also
 standardized
 so
 that
 the
 mean
 is
 0
 and
 the
 standard
deviation
 is
 1.
The
 measure
 of
 corruption
 in
 the
 healthcare
 sector
ranges
 from
 the
 Hovedstaden
 region
 in
 Denmark
 (1.825,
very
 low
 levels
 of
 healthcare
 sector
 corruption)
 to
 the
region
 of
 Yugozapaden
 in
 Bulgaria
 (−2.268,
 very
 high
 levels
of
 healthcare
 sector
 corruption).
 The
 measure
 of
 bribery
 in
society
 ranges
 from
 the
 region
 of
 Midtylland
 in
 Denmark
(0.926,
 very
 low
 levels
 of
 bribery)
 to
 the
 region
 of
 Bucuresti-
Ilfov
 in
 Romania
 (4.624,
 very
 high
 levels
 of
 bribery).

 Dependent
 variable
The
 Special
 Eurobarometer
 338
 was
 in
 field
 between
13
 November
 and
 9
 December
 2009
 and
 included
 resi-
dents
 aged
 15
 years
 or
 above
 in
 all
 the
 27
 EU
 member
states.
 The
 survey
 concerned
 the
 use
 of
 antibiotics
 by
 Euro-
peans,
 public
 knowledge
 and
 perceptions
 about
 antibiotics,
and
 the
 impact
 of
 antibiotic
 awareness
 campaigns
 on
 the
knowledge
 and
 practices
 of
 Europeans
 related
 to
 antibi-
otics.
 To
 measure
 antibiotic
 consumption,
 the
 following
question
 was
 asked
 in
 the
 survey:
 ‘Have
 you
 taken
 any
antibiotics
 orally
 such
 as
 tablets,
 powder
 or
 syrup
 in
 the
last
 12
 months?’
 In
 total,
 about
 40%
 of
 all
 respondents
answered
 that
 they
 had
 taken
 antibiotics
 during
 the
 past
year.
 The
 answers
 to
 the
 question
 were
 aggregated
 to
 the
regional
 level
 by
 means
 of
 the
 survey
 question
 regarding
respondents’
 region
 of
 residence.
2.3.
 Confounders
In
 the
 multivariate
 analysis,
 the
 confounders
 of
 pur-
chasing
 
power
 
standardized
 
regional
 
gross
 
domestic
product
 (GDP),
 inhabitants
 per
 medical
 doctor
 and
 age-
standardized
 all
 case
 mortality
 rates
 were
 included
 in
 the
model
 because
 they
 are
 likely
 to
 be
 correlated
 with
 both
the
 main
 independent
 variable,
 corruption,
 and
 the
 main
dependent
 variable,
 antibiotic
 consumption
 [14,19].
The
 data
 on
 purchasing
 power
 standardized
 regional
GDP
 2011,
 inhabitants
 per
 medical
 doctor
 and
 age-
standardized
 all
 case
 mortality
 rates
 2008–2011
 were
obtained
 from
 Eurostat’s
 statistical
 depository.
2.4.
 Statistics
In
 the
 bivariate
 analysis,
 scatter
 plots
 were
 constructed
to
 illustrate
 the
 association
 between
 the
 two
 dependent
variables,
 prevalence
 of
 corruption
 in
 the
 health
 care
 sector
and
 prevalence
 of
 bribes,
 and
 antibiotic
 consumption
 in
 the
European
 regions.
Pearson’s
 R
 was
 calculated
 to
 investigate
 the
 correla-
tion
 between
 these
 variables.
 Ordinary
 least
 square
 (OLS)
regression
 models
 were
 used
 in
 the
 multivariate
 analy-
sis,
 so
 as
 to
 investigate
 the
 link
 between
 the
 independent
variables
 and
 antibiotic
 consumption,
 while
 controlling
 for
the
 regional
 measures
 of
 purchasing
 power
 standardized
regional
 GDP,
 inhabitants
 per
 medical
 doctor
 and
 age-
standardized
 all
 case
 mortality
 rates.
The
 correlations
 between
 the
 independent
 variables
were
 generally
 low
 or
 moderate
 in
 strength.
 The
 correlation
between
 regional
 GDP
 and
 mortality
 rates
 turned
 out
 to
be
 the
 strongest
 (0.692).
 However,
 multicollinearity
 diag-
nostics
 show
 that
 all
 Variance
 Inflation
 Factors
 (VIFs)
 were
below
 2.5.
In
 total,
 indicators
 for
 both
 corruption/bribery
 and
antibiotic
 consumption
 were
 available
 for
 172
 regions.
However,
 to
 limit
 the
 residual
 from
 biased
 estimations
 of
antibiotic
 consumption
 from
 regions
 with
 few
 respondents
in
 the
 Eurobarometer
 survey,
 regions
 in
 which
 there
 were
fewer
 than

sis.

 Discussion
If
 a
 great
 variation
 in
 antibiotic
 use
 across
 European
countries
 has
 been
 found
 in
 numerous
 previous
 studies
[6–11],
 our
 analysis
 corroborates
 others
 that
 also
 noted
a
 great
 variation
 at
 the
 sub-national
 level
 [11,18].
 Sim-
ilarly
 to
 these
 studies,
 this
 variation
 is
 unlikely
 to
 be
explained
 by
 differences
 in
 the
 frequency
 of
 bacterial
infections.
 Take,
 for
 instance,
 the
 remarkable
 divergences
between
 the
 neighbouring
 regions
 of
 Lazio
 and
 Toscana,
or
 between
 Wallonie/Brussels
 and
 Flanders.
 Their
 pro-
nounced
 differences
 in
 antibiotics
 consumption
 cannot
either
 be
 accounted
 for
 by
 national
 cultural
 factors.
 Neigh-
bouring
 regions
 within
 the
 same
 country
 behave
 very
differently,
 and
 the
 question
 is
 why.
In
 order
 to
 address
 this
 puzzle,
 we
 have
 followed
 a
growing
 interest
 among
 health
 researchers
 and
 policy-
makers
 in
 how
 corruption
 affects
 health
 outcomes
 [20].
Corruption
 has
 been
 found
 to
 be
 negatively
 associated
with
 a
 large
 variety
 of
 healthcare
 outputs
 and
 outcomes
[14,20–25].
 The
 effects
 of
 corruption
 may
 matter
 as
 much
as
 –
 or
 even
 more
 than
 –
 traditionally
 explored
 factors
such
 as
 health-spending
 measures
 [14]
 or
 the
 level
 of
democratization
 [26].
 Corruption
 is
 not
 only
 confined
 to
developing
 countries;
 “corrupt
 practices
 in
 the
 health-care
plague
 many
 developed
 countries”
 [14].
In
 particular,
 this
 study
 has
 explored
 the
 statistical
 asso-
ciation
 between
 antibiotic
 consumption
 and
 two
 measures
of
 corruption.
 The
 analysis
 shows
 a
 significant
 and
 strong
negative
 association
 between
 these
 measures
 of
 corruption
and
 antibiotic
 consumption.
 The
 percentage
 of
 the
 popu-
lation
 stating
 that
 they
 have
 consumed
 antibiotics
 in
 the
past
 year
 was
 significantly
 lower
 in
 regions
 with
 low
 lev-
els
 of
 corruption,
 both
 when
 corruption
 is
 measured
 as
 the
perception
 of
 corruption
 in
 the
 health
 sector
 and
 when
corruption
 is
 measured
 as
 a
 direct
 experience
 with
 bribes.
To
 minimize
 the
 possibility
 of
 a
 spurious
 relationship,
we
 include
 multivariate
 OLS
 regression
 models
 controlling
for
 potential
 confounders,
 such
 as
 the
 level
 of
 economic
development
 (measured
 by
 the
 regional
 GDP
 per
 capita)
and
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 healthcare
 in
 the
 region
 (mea-
sured
 by
 the
 number
 of
 inhabitants
 per
 medical
 doctor
and
 age-standardized
 all
 case
 mortality
 rates).
 The
 associ-
ation
 between
 the
 two
 independent
 variables
 (corruption
in
 the
 health
 sector
 and
 bribery)
 and
 the
 dependent
 vari-
able
 (antibiotic
 consumption)
 is
 found
 to
 be
 persistent
 and
strong
 when
 it
 is
 also
 subjected
 to
 these
 controls.
What
 are
 the
 mechanisms
 connecting
 high
 levels
 of
corruption
 and
 high
 antibiotic
 consumption?
 The
 data
 pre-
sented
 here
 cannot
 identify
 the
 particular
 mechanisms,
but,
 unlike
 previous
 studies
 we
 find
 an
 association
 between
two
 different
 proxies
 for
 corruption
 (corruption
 in
 the
health
 sector
 and
 bribery),
 thus
 indicating
 that
 the
 mech-
anisms
 may
 be
 multiple.
 Those
 mechanisms
 have
 been
pointed
 out
 in
 the
 literature.
 In
 general,
 several
 schol-
ars
 have
 noted
 that
 a
 characteristic
 of
 healthcare
 is
 the
prevalence
 of
 problems
 of
 asymmetric
 information
 that
give
 opportunities
 for
 abuse
 [14].
 Different
 players
 may
take
 advantage
 of
 their
 privileged
 position
 for
 personal
gain,
 including
 the
 government
 regulator,
 the
 payer
 (social
security,
 private
 or
 public
 health
 insurance),
 the
 provider
(public
 or
 private),
 the
 drug
 and
 equipment
 suppliers,
 and
the
 patients
 [27].
In
 the
 first
 place,
 researchers
 have
 remarked
 that
 cor-
ruption
 in
 the
 supply
 of
 pharmaceutical
 could
 explain
the
 connection
 between
 overall
 levels
 of
 corruption
 in
 a
country
 and
 its
 health
 outcomes
 [25].
 The
 existence
 of
 an
influential
 market
 of
 vendors
 and
 pharmaceutical
 firms
creates
 a
 risk
 of
 bribery
 [28],
 and
 the
 discretion
 that
 health
professionals
 have
 in
 deciding
 what
 medicines,
 and
 in
 what
quantities,
 are
 needed
 increases
 the
 opportunity
 for
 abuse
[20].
 Physicians
 may
 become
 both
 psychologically
 and
financially
 dependent
 on
 pharmaceutical
 firms
 as
 a
 result
 of
gifts,
 and
 physicians
 may
 reciprocate
 by
 prescribing
 drugs
of
 those
 pharmaceuticals
 [13,29].
 These
 mechanisms
 may
help
 to
 explain
 the
 link
 between
 measures
 of
 corruption
 in
the
 health
 sector
 and
 antibiotic
 abuse.
 In
 addition,
 schol-
ars
 also
 note
 that
 the
 relation
 between
 patients
 and
 health
professionals
 also
 presents
 risks
 of
 bribery,
 as
 a
 result
 of
information
 asymmetries
 and
 a
 demand
 for
 health
 services,
which
 is
 largely
 inelastic
 [20].
 Consequently,
 patients
 can
ask,
 or
 be
 asked
 to,
 follow
 inappropriate
 procedures
 (e.g.
antibiotics)
 in
 exchange
 for
 under-the-table
 payments
 [30].
These
 mechanisms
 may
 help
 to
 explain
 the
 link
 between
measures
 of
 patients’
 direct
 experience
 with
 corruption
(i.e.
 bribery)
 and
 antibiotic
 abuse.

 and

 at

 national
 level
 [15].
Even
 so,
 the
 study
 has
 several
 limitations.
 The
 current
 study
may
 be
 sensitive
 to
 ecological
 fallacy,
 i.e.
 to
 draw
 inferences
about
 an
 individual
 level
 relationship
 based
 on
 aggregated
data
 analysis.
 Future
 studies
 might
 address
 the
 relationship
between
 corruption
 and
 individual
 consumption-patterns
of
 antibiotics.
 Moreover,
 residual
 confounding
 from
 avail-
ability
 of
 non-prescription
 of
 antibiotics
 may
 account
 for
part
 of
 the
 co-variation
 between
 corruption
 and
 antibiotic
consumption.
 Additionally,
 social
 desirability
 might
 influ-
ence
 on
 respondents
 answering
 the
 question
 about
 their
own
 consumption
 of
 antibiotics.
 Lastly,
 the
 relationship
between
 corruption
 and
 antibiotic
 consumption
 could
 be
spurious
 to
 cultural
 factors,
 such
 as
 cultural
 dimensions,
that,
 in
 cross-country
 analyses,
 have
 been
 found
 to
 affect
–
 or,
 to
 be
 more
 precise,
 to
 be
 statistically
 correlated,
 since
the
 causation
 of
 culture
 is
 inherently
 difficult
 to
 falsify
 –
both
 for
 explaining
 corruption
 and
 quality
 of
 governance
[31]
 and
 antibiotic
 use
 [32].
 Future
 research
 with
 reliable
regional
 data
 on
 cultural
 dimensions
 should
 help
 to
 disen-
tangle
 the
 relations,
 and
 the
 direction
 of
 the
 causal
 arrow,
between
 corruption,
 cultural
 values,
 and
 health
 outcomes
such
 as
 antibiotic

 Conclusions
Using
 novel
 data
 from
 the
 European
 Quality
 of
 Govern-
ment
 Index,
 the
 paper
 finds
 that
 indicators
 of
 corruption
–
 the
 prevalence
 of
 corruption
 in
 the
 health
 sector
 and
prevalence
 of
 bribes
 in
 the
 relations
 between
 citizens
 and
public
 institutions
 –
 are
 strongly
 and
 positively
 linked
 to
consumption
 of
 antibiotics.
 The
 association
 between
 cor-
ruption
 in
 the
 health
 sector
 (and
 the
 extension
 of
 bribery
in
 the
 society)
 and
 antibiotic
 consumption
 is
 found
 to
 be
persistent
 and
 strong
 also
 when
 controlling
 for
 indicators
of
 socioeconomic
 development
 as
 well
 as
 the
 quality
 of
the
 healthcare
 system.
 This
 paper
 thus
 shows
 that
 dys-
functional
 public
 institutions
 seem
 to
 be
 factors
 accounting
for
 some
 of
 the
 notable
 sub-national
 variation
 in
 antibiotic
consumption
 across
 Europe.
 Consequently,
 policy-makers
interested
 in
 promoting
 a
 prudent
 use
 of
 antibiotics
 should
pay
 attention
 to
 the
 role
 of
 governance
 and
 corruption.
