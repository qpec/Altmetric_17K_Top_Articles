Abstract
This review covers recent findings on the main categories of thyroid hormone–disrupting 
chemicals and their effects on brain development. We draw mostly on epidemiological 
and experimental data published in the last decade. For each chemical class considered, 
we deal with not only the thyroid hormone–disrupting effects but also briefly mention 
the main mechanisms by which the same chemicals could modify estrogen and/or 
androgen signalling, thereby exacerbating adverse effects on endocrine-dependent 
developmental programmes. Further, we emphasize recent data showing how maternal 
thyroid hormone signalling during early pregnancy affects not only offspring IQ, 
but also neurodevelopmental disease risk. These recent findings add to established 
knowledge on the crucial importance of iodine and thyroid hormone for optimal brain 
development. We propose that prenatal exposure to mixtures of thyroid hormone–
disrupting chemicals provides a plausible biological mechanism contributing to current 
increases in the incidence of neurodevelopmental disease and IQ loss.
Introduction
Thyroid hormone (TH) is essential for normal brain 
development where it influences, during specific temporal 
windows, neurogenesis, neuronal migration, neuronal and 
glial cell differentiation, myelination and synaptogenesis. 
These TH-dependent processes are crucial during early 
gestation and postnatal development, and then continue, 
albeit at reduced rates, throughout adulthood. During the 
first 10–12 weeks of gestation, the foetus relies entirely 
on maternal TH. Hence, severe maternal TH deficiency 
adversely affects offspring neurodevelopment (1, 2). 
Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that even more 
moderate forms of maternal thyroid dysfunction may 
affect child cognitive development and increase the risk of 
neurodevelopmental disorders (3, 4, 5, 6). Therefore, it is 
important to gain a better understanding of early thyroid 
dysfunction on offspring neurodevelopment (1, 7).
Another major cause of thyroid dysfunction can be 
the presence of thyroid hormone-disrupting chemicals in 
the maternal and fetal environment. Endocrine-disrupting 
 
compounds (EDCs) are xenobiotics that modulate 
hormonal 
homeostasis 
thereby 
inducing 
adverse 
effects (8). Numerous EDCs identified to date contain a 
halogen group substitution with chlorine and bromine. 
Interestingly, THs are the only complex halogenated 
(iodine) molecules produced by and necessary for 
vertebrate homeostasis, making TH physiology highly 
vulnerable 
to 
EDCs. 
Halogen-substituted 
phenolic 
moieties can mimic natural THs and thereby interact 
with multiple aspects of hormone production, feedback, 
distribution, entry into cells, intracellular metabolism 
(deiodination, conjugation) of THs, as well as at the level 
of receptors, as antagonists or analogues.
The aim of this review is to provide an update on 
how different chemicals in the environment can disrupt 
thyroid signalling and thereby affect brain development.

aspects of this question. Notably, in 1998, Brucker-
Davis and colleagues (9) reviewed the different classes of 
chemicals that could affect thyroid signalling and Zoeller 
and Crofton (10) underlined how endocrine disruption 
affected early brain development. A decade later the 
situation was updated by Crofton (11) and by Boas and 
colleagues (12).
No new major classes of TH-disrupting chemicals 
have been characterised since the last review appeared. 
However, within classes certain novel compounds have 
attracted attention. Most often these new compounds 
have been introduced to replace a similar chemical for 
which adverse effects were reported. This has led to many 
examples of ‘regrettable substitutions’ within classes, cases 
of which are described below. Thus, our focus remains 
on perchlorate, phenols, pesticides, polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs), poly brominated flame retardants, 
perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and phthalates (Fig. 1). 
Many of these substances are classed as persistent 
organic pollutants (POPs) and were banned decades ago 
yet they remain environmentally relevant due to their 
 
previous high production volumes and exceptionally 
 
long half-lives.
Perchlorate
Perchlorate is a well-characterised inhibitor of the sodium-
iodide symporter (NIS) that is expressed in the basal 
membrane of thyroid follicular cells and is critical for 
iodide uptake (13). Two other NIS inhibitor classes, nitrates 
and thiocyanates, are found at significant levels in human 
fluids, but in molar terms, they are respectively 240 and 
15 times less active than perchlorate (14). However, their 
environmental levels are such that their combined effects 
should be more often taken into account (15, 16).
Given first, its wide-ranging uses as an oxidant in 
products ranging from in rocket fuel to airbags and second, 
its high stability, perchlorate contamination is widespread. 
Epidemiological data show that despite its short half-life 
(<8 
h in humans), continual exposure means that the 
chemical is virtually ubiquitous in the US population (17). 
Epidemiological evidence showed that perchlorate levels 
were associated with TSH in women, and this association 
was stronger in women with <100 
µg/L urinary iodine 
(18). The relationship was even greater in women who 
smoke, related to the fact that cigarette smoke is a source 
of thiocyanate.
Figure 1
Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) act at multiple levels of the hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis. Environmental chemicals have the 
potential to disrupt the HPT axis, alone or in combination. Given the crucial role for thyroid hormone in brain development, such disruption can have a 
long-lasting functional impact, such as IQ loss and increased risk of neurodevelopmental disease (note: targets not drawn to scale).

Furthermore, recent epidemiological data analysed 
pregnant women for their thyroid status and perchlorate 
levels (19). Offspring born to those women that were 
both borderline hypothyroid and hypothyroxinemic 
and had higher perchlorate levels had a higher risk of 
being in the lowest 10% for IQ scores. The adverse effect 
of perchlorate was not modified by thyroxine therapy 
(150 
µg/day) during pregnancy. However, it is possible 
that the timing of replacement (after 12 weeks pregnancy) 
was too late to exert corrective effects. Other recent data 
also link maternal perchlorate exposure to modified 
thyroid function during pregnancy (20). Iodine has long 
been known to be required for TH synthesis and both 
iodine deficiency and maternal hypothyroidism are risk 
factors for decreased IQ and neurodevelopmental disease 
(21, 22). It is worth noting that in the study cited (20), 
a large proportion of the women (74%) had urinary 
iodine levels below the recommended median level 
(150 
µg/L) for pregnancy, raising the question of whether 
iodine deficiency exacerbates the effects of perchlorate 
(and potentially other TH-disrupting chemicals). This 
question deserves far more research and needs to be taken 
into account in both epidemiological and experimental 
studies. Similarly, the presence of TH-disrupting chemicals 
has been identified as a confounder for epidemiological 
studies assessing effects of iodine supplementation during 
pregnancy (23).
Phenols
Two 
principal 
phenols 
are 
well-characterised 
TH 
disruptors, bisphenol A (BPA) and triclosan (TCS). Both 
have high production volumes and been so extensively 
used that they are now virtually ubiquitous contaminants 
of human fluids (24) and the environment (25).
Bisphenol A (BPA, 4,4′ isopropylidenediphenol)
BPA is an organic synthetic compound, first identified as 
a synthetic estrogen in 1930s (26). Current common uses 
of BPA are in plastic products such as water bottles and 
food containers, CDs, DVDs, safety equipment, thermal 
paper and medical devices. In the United States, France 
and Denmark, BPA is restricted for certain uses, such as 
baby bottles. More recently, since 2015, France banned 
the use of BPA in plastic food containers. The same year 
(2015), EFSA maintained their opinion delivered in 
2013 that BPA poses no health risks, but the committee 
lowered the tolerable daily intake from 50 
µg/kg 
bw/day to 
 
4 
µg/kg 
bw/day (27). Despite these recent restrictions, there 
is still widespread exposure to BPA in human populations 
(28). It is retained in humans and has been found in 
pregnant women’s serum, placenta and breast milk 
 
(29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34). As restrictions were increasingly 
placed on BPA use, a number of structural BPA analogues 
such as bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol 
B (BPB) were marketed. These analogues are found now 
in considerable quantities in human urine (35, 36, 37, 
38). These replacement chemicals are often described as 
‘regrettable substitutions’ as their EDC-related effects are 
apparently no less than those of BPA, including effects 
on TH signalling (39, 40) and estrogen receptor (ER) 
signalling (41).
As BPA is primarily thought of as an estrogen disruptor 
but is also a TH modulator. EDC action across endocrine 
systems is to be expected as crosstalk exists at multiple 
levels: from different nuclear receptors (42) to individual 
target genes and networks to physiological systems. As 
BPA can interact with multiple nuclear hormone receptors 
including ER (43), estrogen-related receptors (ERR) 
(44), AR (45, 46) and thyroid hormone receptors (TR) 
 
(39, 47, 48), potential crosstalk needs to be considered at 
 
multiple levels.
BPA and ER interaction has been reviewed extensively 
elsewhere, for both classical and non-classical estrogen 
receptors (8, 49). As to TRs, some experimental studies 
show that BPA does not bind to TR based on a competitive 
TR-binding test (50, 51, 52), others show T3-TR-mediated 
agonistic and antagonistic effects of BPA (48, 53, 54). 
More recently, binding affinities of BPA and its analogues 
BPF and BPS, with TR were calculated in silico and found 
to be roughly similar (55). When tested by a spectrum of 
 
in vitro and in vivo methods, all three analogues activated 
TH signalling in the absence of T3 (39). The in vitro 
approaches 
included 
competitive 
binding 
assays, 
molecular 
docking 
and 
coactivator-binding 
assays, 
whereas the in vivo methodology exploited TH-response 
gene responses in Pelophylax nigromaculatus tadpoles.
In human epidemiology, studies have reported 
changes in TH parameters as a function of BPA exposure 
in adults (56, 57, 58, 59), including in pregnant women 
(60, 61, 62). In pregnant women, maternal BPA levels 
were inversely (62) or positively (60) associated with T4 
levels while two studies reported no association (61, 63). 
In humans, inverse associations of BPA with TSH have 
also been reported in both sexes (60) and in other cases, 
only in women (61). Yet another study reported a positive 
association (64). Such inconsistencies need to be examined 
notably for methodological differences between studies.

Thyroid-disrupting chemicals 
and brain development

We now focus specifically on BPA and TH and 
neurodevelopment. Increased prenatal BPA exposure 
is implicated in several sex-specific changes in child 
behaviour (65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70). Prenatal BPA exposure 
is linked to increased internalizing behaviours in boys 
(66, 67, 70) and increased risk of ADHD-related behaviour 
(65). In girls, prenatal BPA exposure has been associated 
with both internalising and externalising behaviours 
 
(66, 69), as well as poor executive function (68). It is possible 
that differences in the results are due to varying timing of 
sample collection, exposure and assessment among the 
studies. Studies on postnatal childhood BPA exposure and 
effects on neurodevelopment are even more inconsistent. 
Some studies report a positive association of BPA levels 
with ADHD-linked behaviours in both girls and boys (71), 
and anxious, depressive or aggressive behaviours in girls 
(66, 67, 72). Others report null association with childhood 
BPA 
exposure 
and 
neurodevelopmental 
outcomes 
 
(68, 73). Pubertal BPA exposure has also been associated 
with poorer cognitive performance in adolescence (74) 
and adulthood (75).
The lack of full endocrine profiles in these 
epidemiological studies makes it hard to pinpoint the 
exact mechanism linking endocrine disruption and 
neurodevelopmental outcome. Animal studies however 
can better define mode of action. Such studies link BPA 
levels with behavioural outcomes often associated with 
TH disruption including, hyperactivity (not sex specific) 
(76, 77), anxiety (78) and decreased motor activity (79). 
Prenatal BPA exposure in mice also results in mostly sex-
specific changes in aggression and cognitive defects (80, 
81, 82, 83, 84, 85). These sex-specific changes are not 
surprising due to the role of estrogen in differentiation 
of sexually dimorphic areas involved in behaviour and 
cognitive development (86). BPA exposure also causes 
epigenetic changes (methylation) on the ER-α gene in the 
cortex and hypothalamus of male and female mice and 
alters mRNA levels of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 
and DNMT3A (78, 87). Interestingly, DNMT3A is a well-
known TH-responsive gene, activated by liganded TRs 
(88, 89).
Halogenated 
BPAs 
include 
a 
bromine 
(Tetrabromobisphenol 
A, 
TBBPA) 
or 
chlorine 
(Tetrachlorobisphenol-A, 
TCBPA) 
substitute 
on 
the 
phenolic ring and are common flame retardants. TBBPA is 
currently the flame retardant with the highest production 
volume worldwide. It is found in printed electronic circuit 
boards and in plastics for electrical housings or piping. 
Due to its high production volume, toxicological effects 
attributed to TBBPA have been extensively reviewed by 
governments (90, 91, 92) and deemed to have no health 
hazard, risk or concerns to humans. However, Van der Ven 
and colleagues (93) assessing multiple in vivo studies on 
rats concluded that the margin of exposure for humans 
was only 2.6 and that TBBPA exposure was a matter of 
concern for authorities.
What is more, TBBPA has been established in vitro 
as neurotoxicant that disrupts multiple intracellular 
pathways including zinc and calcium homeostasis, 
inducing oxidative stress (94, 95, 96, 97) as well as acting 
as a partial GABAA agonist at 0.1 
µM (98). So far, results 
for in vivo developmental toxicity are less consistent. The 
conclusions of Van der Ven et al. (93) for instance contrast 
with those of certain toxicologists (99, 100). Although 
Viberg and Eriksson (2011) reported more marked effects 
for PBDE 99 than TBBPA in neonatal mouse brain, they 
observed downregulation of a certain classes of nicotinic 
receptors in the frontal cortex with both chemicals 
(101). In our laboratory, studies on mice showed that 
gestational exposure to TBBPA decreased TRH receptor 
and melanocortin 4 receptor basal expression in pups, 
dramatically affecting T3-induced repression of these 
genes (102).
Some studies have reported neural defects, including 
impaired motor function in zebrafish (103). Similarly, 
Nakajima and colleagues reported behavioural effects 
of TBBPA administration in adult mice and differential 
accumulation of the chemical according to brain region 
(104). Further, Lilienthal et al. noted increased latency 
of hearing responses in a rat one generation study (105). 
Interestingly, development of the inner ear is known to be 
a TH-dependent process (106).
Significant reduction in circulating T4 is the most 
frequent phenotype seen across rodent studies as a 
function of TBBPA exposure (93, 107). T4 reductions could 
occur through activation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, 
UGT, which increases metabolism of T4 in the liver and 
subsequent reduction of serum T4 levels (108). In vitro, 
TBBPA competes with binding of transthyretin (TTR) 
and interferes with T3-dependent cell proliferation (109). 
In a fluorescent polarization assay, TBBPA was found to 
modulate both coactivator and co-repressor interactions 
with TR (110). TBBPA also shows TH-disrupting effects 
in amphibian models. In Rana rugosa, TBBPA displayed 
inhibitory effects on T3-induced tail shortening (111) and 
in Xenopus laevis, TBBPA exerted antagonistic effects in 
the presence of high TH levels, but agonistic activity with 
low TH levels (112). TBBPA has also been demonstrated as 
a TH disruptor using both the amphibian metamorphosis 
assay (112, 113) and the Xenopus embryonic thyroid assay

(XETA) (114). In the latter study, TBBPA was further found 
to alter expression of TH target genes implicated in neural 
stem cell function and differentiation. Whether such 
effects extend to other proliferative brain regions during 
development remains to be investigated (115).
In rats, TBBPA exposure increases estrogen levels 
(108) and uterine tumours (116), effects thought to be 
related to inhibition of liver estradiol sulfotransferase 
(109). The combined effects of TBBPA, increasing estrogen 
and antagonising TH signalling could well interact to 
modify genetic and cellular responses, as well as inducing 
longer-term adverse physiological responses governing 
reproduction.
Triclosan (TCS, 2,4,4-trichloro-hydroxy 
diphenyl ether)
Triclosan (TCS) is a widely used chlorinated phenolic 
antimicrobial and antifungal agent. It has been used for 
over 40 years as an antiseptic, disinfectant or preservative 
in medical and personal care products such as hand soaps 
and shampoos, mouthwash, toothpaste and cosmetics. 
While it has been banned from soaps and body washes 
in the United States, it is still extensively used in skin 
care products and toothpaste. TCS has a short half-life in 
humans, that is it is rapidly absorbed, metabolized and 
eliminated (primarily via urine) with a median excretion 
half-life of 11 
h after oral intake (117). Despite this rapid 
clearance, the over use of products containing TCS 
maintain permanent, but varying exposure. The most 
likely sources in humans are ingestion and skin absorption. 
TCS has been found in the majority of urine samples 
obtained via population-based studies in North America 
(118, 119). TCS has also been detected in human milk and 
pregnant women’s urine (120, 121, 122). EU has restricted 
TCS use as a preservative to a maximum concentration of 
0.2% in mouthwashes and 0.3% in other categories (123). 
In the environment, TCS likely accumulates in sediments 
as it is a lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility 
and is commonly found contaminant in solid and water 
compartments (124, 125).
Several animal studies have confirmed TCS to act as 
a TH-disruptive chemical. In pregnant rats, TCS decreases 
serum T3 and T4, disrupts pup sex ratio balance and lowers 
their body weights (126, 127, 128). TH disruption is also 
evident during weaning rats when their mothers are 
exposed to triclosan (126, 127). In mice, decreased levels 
of T4 are also observed after a short-term oral exposure 
to triclosan (129, 130, 131). In amphibian models, 
 
the North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and 
Xenopus laevis, TCS exposure results in the disruption 
of TH-dependent metamorphosis, marked metabolic 
disorders of the liver and modulation of innate immunity 
(132, 133, 134).
In addition to TH, numerous studies report 
adverse effects of TCS exposure on reproductive organ 
development in male rats i.e., decreased testosterone and 
sperm production (135), and early age of pubertal onset in 
female mice (136). In vitro assays have confirmed TCS to 
act as an estrogen agonist using ERα and ERβ reporter gene 
assays (137, 138, 139) stimulate breast and ovarian cancer 
cell growth in vitro (140, 141) and magnifying the effects 
of ethinyl estradiol (136, 142). In rodent models, TCS, like 
TBBA (see above) inhibits estrogen sulfation by inhibiting 
sulfotransferases, thus preventing metabolism of estradiol 
into biologically inactive forms (143, 144, 145) thereby 
increasing circulating estrogen levels (143). Similar effects 
are seen in sheep (144). It is worth noting that these same 
sulfotransferases metabolise TH as well.
Epidemiological studies have investigated the short-
term and long-term effect of TCS and TH parameters, with 
inconsistent findings (56, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150). Many 
report no significant disruptions in TH levels while some 
report only most marked effects (149, 151). Among the 
effects, some observe a positive association between TCS 
and total T3 (149) in adolescents, while others report an 
inverse association between TCS and fT3 (151) levels in 
pregnant women. A prospective study on prenatal TCS 
exposure recently reported reduced head circumference 
in boys but not girls (152).
Flavonoids
Flavonoids are phenols that occur as natural food 
items. Recent work identified the plant extract (Silybum) 
silymarin, and its derivatives silychristin and silybilin, 
as inhibitors of the membrane TH transporter, mct8 
(slc16a2). Entry of both T3 and T4 into target cells is 
reduced (153). This feature highlights the possible, and 
little studied, effects of compounds that interact with 
membrane TH transporters.
Pesticides
Pesticide usage increased dramatically over the last 
century, arguably to keep up with the demands of a

growing population. However, many studies have shown 
that pesticide usage is excessive and that yields can be 
maintained even when halving pesticide use (154). Many 
pesticides exert toxicological effects, including on thyroid 
signalling. Notably, the European Food Safety Authority 
reported that of 287 pesticide files examined, 101 showed 
effects indicative of thyroid disruption (155). Even though 
many incriminated pesticides have now been banned, 
many of them are still in use in emerging economies. 
Further, many of these chemicals are persistent due to 
their long half-lives and remain in the environment long 
after their ban. Such pesticides are called legacy pesticides, 
with many being common environmental contaminants. 
Here, we choose a few examples of this latter category 
and some others that currently on the market, but are 
potentially problematic.
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane 
(DDT) 
is 
an 
organochlorine insecticide, first used in World War I to 
control malaria and typhus. Its initial notoriety arose 
due to widespread effects on wildlife described by Rachel 
Carlson in her 1962 book Silent Spring (156), notoriety that 
led to its ban in the United States by 1972 and worldwide 
by the Stockholm Convention on POPs later that decade. 
Despite the ban, it is still used in certain countries to fight 
against malaria and dengue fever (157). DDT, and its main 
metabolite 
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethylene 
(DDE), 
are highly persistent, lipophilic compounds that bio-
accumulate and are still found in significant amounts in 
the environment and in humans, including in pregnant 
women (158, 159, 160). Prenatal exposure to p,p′-DDT 
and p,p′-DDE has been associated with obesity (161, 162) 
and a significant reduction in children’s psychomotor 
neurodevelopment (162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168), in 
some cases, in a sex-specific manner (162, 169, 170). The 
latter is not surprising as DDT binds to and activates ERs 
in both reproductive and other tissues including the brain 
(171, 172). On the other hand, DDE has been shown to 
inhibit androgens from binding to their receptors (173, 
174). In adolescent boys, DDE is associated with increased 
testosterone (175) and decreased luteinizing hormone 
(176) while DDT is associated with decreases in both 
luteinizing hormone and testosterone (176). In women, 
 
in utero exposure to DDT, as judged by umbilical cord 
levels, has been associated with an increased risk of breast 
cancer later in life (177).
DDT and its metabolites have also been confirmed as 
TH-disrupting chemicals through human epidemiological 
studies (158, 178, 179, 180, 181). Studies have found 
negative association with DDE and total T3 and T4 levels 
(182, 183) and a positive association with TSH levels (183); 
suggesting an anti-thyroid effect. In contrast, recent studies 
found a positive association of DDE with total T3 and T4 
levels, and a non-significant TSH reduction in floriculture 
workers (158, 179). These differences could be due to 
different levels of exposure and/or exposure to additional 
chemicals and characteristics of the populations studied, 
such as iodine or thyroid status and genetic factors.
In experimental studies, rats exposed to DDE exposure 
exhibit lower free T4 levels. One target of DDT action on 
thyroid metabolism may be through the inhibition of TSH-
stimulated intracellular accumulation of cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) by the action of DDT on the 
TSH receptor (184, 185, 186, 187). The highly lipophilic 
DDT may also interfere indirectly with the TSH receptor 
by altering the phosphor-lipid composition of the thyroid 
cell membrane, rendering the TSH receptor unable to 
internalise and instead be released extracellularly in 
vesicle forms in the presence of DDT (188). These vesicles 
have been suggested to initiate autoimmunity favouring 
the development of Graves’ disease (184). Mice exposed 
to DDE also exhibit reduced expression of TTR and Dio2 
mRNA, which further explains the reduced free T4 levels 
observed (189, 190). Increased expression of several 
hepatic enzymes can further contribute to TH degradation 
(190). Another study in mice reported that DDT exposure 
was associated with increased peripheral conversion of T4 
into T3, reduced TSH levels and morphological changes in 
the thyroid gland typical of iodine deficiency (191).
Hexachlorobenzene (HCB)
Hexachlorobenzene 
(HCB) 
is 
an 
organochloride, 
used primarily as a fungicide for seeds and as a wood-
preserving agent. It was banned globally in 1979 under 
the Stockholm Convention on POPs as a pesticide. Its 
current main source is through the industrial emission as 
a by-product of the manufacture of chlorinated solvents 
and pesticides. It is extremely lipophilic and accumulates 
in the environment. It gained prominence during late 
1950s when accidentally over-treated HCB-treated seeds 
were consumed by the general public in Turkey. Affected 
individuals, 
primarily 
children, 
displayed 
changed 
porphyrin metabolism, leading to porphyria cutanea tarda, 
enlarged liver and thyroid gland and osteoporosis (192, 
193). Similar effects have been observed in HCB-exposed 
rats (194) i.e. hepatic and thyroid neoplasms (195, 196, 
197), porphyria (193, 198). Other epidemiological studies

have found associations between lower levels of HCB and 
decreased gestational length (199), poor social competence 
(200) and increased body weight during childhood (201). 
Studies on floriculture workers have further revealed an 
association between HCB with decreased levels of total T4 
(TT4) (202) and TT3 (203). In animal studies, HCB is known 
to disrupt progesterone and estradiol concentrations 
(204, 205, 206), impair reproductive efficiency (207, 208) 
and reduce neonatal viability and growth (209). It also 
disrupts levels of T3 and T4 (210, 211), leads to goitre (212) 
and hypothyroidism (213). Disruption of the TH axis may 
partly be due to HCB’s action on the activity and expression 
of hepatic Dio1 and Dio2 enzymes, respectively (214). 
In rats, HCB has been shown to induce apoptosis in the 
thyroid cells, most likely due to action on mitochondria 
through oxidative stress (215, 216). There is also evidence 
that HCB may competitively inhibit binding of thyroxine 
to serum carrier proteins (214, 215). More investigations 
are required to elucidate the exact mechanisms of HCB on 
TH signalling.
Chlorpyrifos (CPF, O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-
pyridinyl) ester phosphorothioic acid)
Chlorpyrifos is a member of the organophosphate class of 
insecticides that target the central and peripheral nervous 
system specifically inhibiting the enzyme activity of 
acetylcholinesterase (217). It is currently one of the most 
widely used insecticides in the United States and other 
countries, to manage insect pests on agricultural crop. 
CPF applications were once particularly heavy in urban 
areas, where the exposed populations included pregnant 
women (218, 219). Interestingly, its ban in household 
use in 2001 allowed for a natural experiment within 
an ongoing birth cohort study at Columbia University. 
Before the ban, decreases in birth weight and length were 
observed in association with CPF in newborn cord blood. 
After the ban, these outcomes disappeared (220). This 
result has been observed more recently (221), a result that 
is not surprising as CPF readily crosses the placenta (222). 
Further studies have reported prenatal CPF exposure 
association with impaired cognition and motor function 
(223), 
attention-deficit 
hyperactive 
disorder 
(224), 
deficits in working memory and reduced IQ (225) and 
tremors during childhood (226). While some groups have 
considered that the levels of CPF in cord blood are too 
low to induce adverse effects (227, 228), one needs to take 
into account that the half-life of CPF is approximatively 
27 
h (229). Thus, the possibility of substantially higher 
in utero levels of CPF is considerable. Despite these 
studies and its recent thorough evaluation by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) and Danish Environmental 
Protection Agency finding, toxicological evidence to 
be strong and the epidemiological evidence to be of 
moderate-to-high quality, the EPA denied a recent petition 
for ban calling it ‘crucial to U.S. agriculture’ (230). Not 
surprisingly, given the well-demonstrated epidemiological 
data showing negative effects on brain development, this 
decision has been severely criticised (231).
Given the importance of TH to brain development, 
the neurological and impaired cognitive outcomes 
associated with CPF exposure could well have underlying 
thyroid hormone-dependent mechanisms. Two studies 
based on analysis of NHANES data from the years 
 
1999–2002 describe significant associations between levels 
of chlorpyrifos metabolite, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol 
(TCPY) and thyroid parameters, namely increased TT4 
in both males and females and decreased TSH levels in 
males, with increased TSH levels in females (232, 233).
In rat studies, a reduction in brain T4 levels is seen 
following prenatal CPF exposure whereas postnatal 
exposure results in a transient elevation in young 
adulthood (234). Mice exposed to low-dose CPF display 
reduced serum T4 levels and display altered thyroid 
follicular size, with an apparent higher vulnerability in 
males (235) and anxiety-like behaviour (236). Reduction 
of T4 in response to CPF has also been observed in rats 
(237), whereas exposure to CPF’s methyl counterpart 
(chlorpyrifos-methyl) results in reduced T4 and increased 
TSH (hypothyroidism) (238). In our lab, CPF was shown 
to affect TH signalling using a transgenic reporter. 
Moreover, a short embryonic exposure impacts mature 
brain structure (Spirhanzlova P, Leemans M, Sébastien LE, 
Mughal BB, Wejaphikul K, Fini J-B, Visser T & Demeneix BA, 
 
unpublished observations).
As to the effects on ER and AR signalling, CPF has been 
found to interfere with the ERβ mRNA steady state level 
(239, 240) and exert an ERα-dependent estrogenic effect 
on cell proliferation in vitro (241) and in vivo (242). CPF 
also has anti-androgenic activity as Leydig cells from the 
rat exposed to CPF in vitro exhibit a significant decrease in 
testosterone biosynthesis (243). More epidemiological and 
experimental data are urgently needed as this pesticide is 
being assessed for renewal in the EU from 2019.
Other pesticides
As previously stated, more than a 100 of the 287 pesticides 
examined by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 
had features indicative of thyroid disruption (155).

Thyroid-disrupting chemicals 
and brain development
R167
7:4
In the recent review of chemicals that could be used as 
reference for thyroid disruption screening, Wegner and 
colleagues identified a number of phytopharmaceuticals 
or biocides with TH-disrupting activity (244). To cite a 
few, their list contained different classes of fungicides 
and organophosphates, along with a number of juvenile 
hormone analogues. Among the fungicides, figure 
the ethylene bisdithiocarbamates (EBDC) e.g. maneb, 
mancozeb, ziram, zineb. Their common degradation 
product, ethylene thiourea (ETU), in addition to being a 
type IIB carcinogen, interferes with iodide organification by 
inhibiting 
thyroid 
peroxidase 
(TPO) 
(245) 
thereby 
decreasing 
thyroidal production of T3 and T4 in experimental animals 
(246, 247). In addition, the animals exhibit increased 
 
thyroid/body weight ratio, histopathological changes 
and reduced serum protein-bound iodine (246). Recent 
epidemiological data further underlines the importance of 
iodine status and the effect of ETU on thyroid function (248). 
Another class of fungicides with TH-disrupting activity are 
the azoles. This class of fungicide can enhance TH hepatic 
metabolism through the induction of enzymes uridine 
diphosphate-glucuronosyl-transferase (UDPGT), thereby 
increasing 
biliary 
elimination 
of 
T3 
and 
T4 
(249). 
Reduction 
of 
 
TH level varies considerably depending on the class 
 
of azoles (250).
The organophosphate insecticide malathion is an 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, similar to CPF, widely 
used in North American agriculture and residential 
landscapes, and in public health pest control programmes 
such as residential mosquito eradication. It has also been 
characterised as an inhibitor of teleost TPO (251) and TTR 
(252, 253). Other authors have documented increased levels 
of T3 and reduced T4 as a function of malathion exposure 
(254, 255). As it is currently an approved insecticide in 
North America and Europe, it is important to note that it 
has been associated with a strongly increased risk of thyroid 
cancer in spouses of pesticide applicators (256).
Pyrethroids are synthetic organic insecticides similar 
to the natural pyrethrins produced by the flowers of 
chrysanthemums. Due to their high lipophilicity and 
persistence, they are prone to bioaccumulation. Further, 
toxicological studies have demonstrated their potential 
to disrupt the endocrine system and exert developmental 
toxicity (257). Permethrin (PM), one of the most heavily 
used synthetic pyrethroids, exerts estrogenic effect 
in zebrafish (258) while other pyrethroids have been 
demonstrated as interfering with TRs (259), TTR binding 
(260) and Dio1 inhibition (261, 262). Several rat studies 
also suggest that pyrethroid insecticides alter serum TH 
levels, mostly increasing total T3 levels (255, 263, 264, 265).
Finally, a pyridine-based juvenile hormone analogue 
pesticide, Pyriproxyfen, has been suggested as a TH-active 
substance (244). This and other findings led us and 
colleagues to suspect it could be implicated in the 
increased incidence of Zika-induced microcephaly in 
north eastern Brazil (266), especially given its use at high 
levels in drinking water during the outbreak (266).
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
PCBs are a class of organic man-made chemicals that 
were mass produced globally since the 1920s, until their 
commercial production ban in the United States in 1979. 
They were widely used as plasticizers, in hydraulic fluids, 
heat transfer fluids, lubricants and electrical equipment 
like capacitors and transformers. A total of 209 possible 
congeners exists, classed according to the number and 
position of chlorine atoms carried. PCBs can also be 
metabolized by hydroxylation to OH-PCBs. Due to their 
high chemical stability, PCBs do not readily break down 
and are still found in significant quantities throughout 
the environment and human fluids (267). PCBs and 
their metabolites are known to efficiently transfer from 
maternal to foetal blood via the placenta (268, 269) and 
to nursing children via milk (270, 271). Prenatal PCB 
exposure in human has been associated with increased 
risk of a number of TH-related disorders including, high 
BMI (272), IQ loss (273, 274, 275), cognitive defects (23, 
273, 276, 277, 278), reduced visual recognition memory 
(274), attention and motor deficits (276, 279, 280, 281), 
increased risk of autism (282, 283) and ADHD (273, 
284, 285). In PCB-exposed adults, an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease has been reported (286), as has 
a slightly increased risk of thyroid autoimmunity in 
 
men (287, 288).
Due to their physiochemical properties, PCBs have 
long been suspected to act as TH and other steroidal 
hormone analogues (2, 289). Numerous publications 
covering both epidemiological and experimental studies 
have confirmed the association of hydroxylated and 
non-hydroxylated PCBs with decreased TH levels, T4 
(290, 291, 292) and T3 (292, 293, 294, 295). In fact, 
serum hypothyroxinemia is the most frequently 
reported adverse health effect in human populations 
exposed to PCBs due to displacement of T4 from TTR 
and subsequent increase of metabolism (296). PCBs 
in cord blood have also been linked with low thyroid-
binding globulin (TBG) (293) and high TSH levels (297, 
298). In contrast to the latter study, a recent analysis of

three cohorts revealed slightly lower levels of TSH with 
 
PCB-153 exposure (299).
In experimental studies, PCB and their metabolites 
demonstrate a clear association with reduced TH levels 
in animal models (300, 301, 302) and induce long-
term effects on behaviour and neurodevelopment 
(303, 304). More recent studies have highlighted other 
possible mechanisms of PCB action on additional TH 
axis components. TTR disruption may play a role in 
distribution of hydroxylated PCBs to the placenta and the 
brain as PCB metabolites are known competitors for TTR’s 
T4-binding pocket (296, 305). PCB exposure suppresses 
NIS expression (301) through the Akt/FoxO3a/NIS 
 
pathway (306, 307). NIS suppression may also be due to 
inflammation by PCB exposure. The PCB-induced AhR/JNK 
 
pathway stimulates the production of cytokines and 
thereby suppresses NIS expression (308). Hydroxylated 
PCBs may also inhibit SULT-catalysed THs sulfation 
(309). A more recent study on infants found further an 
association between PCBs in maternal blood with high 
T3 and low rT3 in cord serum indicating possible action 
on deiodinases (310). Finally, iodine status can have a 
major impact on the effect of PCB exposure (23). A pilot 
study found that PCB exposure lessens the benefits of 
iodine supplementation during pregnancy in a borderline 
iodine-deficient group and higher PCB levels have a 
negative impact on the neurocognitive development of 
the offspring.
The importance of other endocrine systems especially 
the sex hormones must not be overlooked as many sexually 
dimorphic changes due to gestational PCB exposure 
have been reported. Gestationally PCB-exposed females 
pups display increased birth weight, higher locomotor 
behaviours, higher corticosterone concentrations while 
the males display increased anogenital distances (311, 
312). Certain PCB metabolites have been shown to interact 
with the ERs acting either as agonists or antagonists (313, 
314). On the other hand, one PCB metabolite (PCB104) 
exhibits both, AR antagonistic and ER agonist properties 
(315). PCBs may also induce estrogenicity indirectly 
through inhibition of the estrogen sulfotransferase (316).
Polybrominated flame retardants
PBDEs are widely used flame retardants being used in 
furniture, carpets, automobiles, electrical appliances and 
flame-retardant fabrics. PBDEs are lipophilic in nature 
and as they are not chemically bound to the substrate, 
they easily accumulate in the environment. High levels 
are found in diverse situations from house dust (317) to 
river sediments (318). There are 209 congeners of PBDEs, 
due to the different possible bromine substitutions on 
the biphenyl backbone. Similar to PCBs, hydroxylated 
PBDEs (OH-PBDEs) add to the complexity of chemical 
interactions and stability. Production and usage of the 
less brominated PBDEs were banned in Europe in 2004, 
and more recently extended to BDE-209 (or deca-BDE). As 
BDE-209, is the most highly brominated compound (10 
bromines), it is easily broken down into less brominated 
congeners (318). However, general levels of PBDE are 
increasing despite the ban (see for instance: (319)). In the 
United States, despite similar restrictions and phase out 
of deca-PBDE at the end of 2013 (except for certain uses) 
the entire population have detectable levels of at least one 
PBDE congener in their blood (320).
As PBDEs are persistent, PBDE congeners are still found 
in significant amounts in the placenta (321), fetal blood 
(322), and breast milk (323). Early exposure of PBDEs 
has also been associated with decreased IQ, diminished 
language and reading abilities, increased problems with 
hyperactivity and attention, and poorer executive function 
in children (324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332). 
Among these, two studies further observed sex-specific 
differences. Vuong et al. reported significantly poorer 
executive function among boys with higher concurrent 
BDE-153 and no associations in girls, while Sagiv et al., 
observed poorer executive function in girls with higher 
4 PBDE (BDE-47, -99, -100, -153) concentrations, but not 
in boys (327, 333). These sex-specific differences need to 
be investigated further as other studies have revealed no 
statistically significant sex interactions (328, 329).
The biological mechanism for sex differences in PBDE 
exposure-related neurotoxicity remains unknown. These 
behavioural changes are not surprising as PBDEs are well 
known to pass the blood–brain barrier, accumulate in 
the central nervous system and induce developmental 
neurotoxicity (334). Neonatal rodents exposed to PBDEs 
exhibit behavioural changes (335, 336, 337, 338), with 
reduced hippocampal long-term potentiation, modified 
intracellular calcium homeostasis (339), oxidative stress 
(340) and reduced postsynaptic protein levels in the 
hippocampus (341). Poorer attention and executive 
function suggests that PBDEs may also target the prefrontal 
cortex region of the brain (342, 343).
The precise mechanism of PBDE action at a molecular 
level, still remains to be elucidated. Clearly, one plausible 
action of PBDEs is through its disruption of TH availability. 
Several epidemiological studies have reported increased 
TSH levels, lower total T4 and, in some studies greater

free T3 levels in humans, including children (295, 344, 
345, 346, 347, 348, 349). These TH parameters are not 
always consistent and the differences in findings may be 
due to the median levels of PBDEs as demonstrated by a 
meta-analysis (350). High levels of PBDEs were positively 
correlated with TSH/T4 levels while low PBDE levels 
were negatively associated. Decreased levels of T4 are, 
however, the most consistently observed adverse effect 
observed in populations, as a function of PBDE exposure. 
Decreased circulating TH levels have also been observed 
in experimental studies on rodents, fish and birds after 
exposure to perinatal PBDE (340, 351, 352, 353, 354). 
Further, PBDE congeners have been tested for their agonist 
and antagonist properties against TRs. Using a reporter 
gene assay, PBDE congeners, including hydroxylated 
compounds, inhibited TR-mediated transcription at 
varying concentrations (355, 356, 357, 358, 359). The 
antagonist action of PBDEs on TR is further evident 
through its effect on purkinje cell dendrite arborisation 
and neural progenitor cell differentiation into the 
oligodendrocyte lineage (360, 361). In contrast, several 
hydroxylated PBDEs have been reported to act as agonists 
on TH-dependent transcription (355). Recently, using 
zebrafish knock down model of TRβ, the developmental 
toxicity of PBDE was demonstrated (362).
Several hydroxylated PBDE congeners have been 
shown to bind to and alter T4 binding to the two TH 
distributor proteins, TBG and TTR (363, 364). The 
displacement of T4 from TTR and TBG, may lead to 
its increased glucuronidation, followed by decrease 
in circulating T4 and hence higher TSH. PBDEs and 
hydroxylated metabolites alter DIO2 activity in different 
astrocyte cell lines (365). BDE-99 decreased DIO2 activity 
by up to 80% while 3-OH-BDE-47, 6-OH-BDE-47, 
and 5-OH-BDE-99 also decreased DIO2 activity by 
45–80%. Multiple mechanisms appear to contribute 
to the decreased DIO2 activity, including weakened 
expression of DIO2 mRNA, competitive inhibition of 
DIO2, and enhanced post-translational degradation of 
DIO2. As astrocytes produce more than 50% of T3 used 
by the brain, Roberts et al. propose that PBDE exposure 
could compromise T3 delivery to the brain (365). A 
possible mechanism for this effect has been investigated 
 
in silico and thought to be halogen bonding of PBDEs 
to the active site selenocysteine (366). Studies have also 
found upregulation of Dio1 and Dio3, i.e. inducing local 
hyperthyroidism, in the periventricular zone of the brain, 
suggesting another, as yet under-estimated, mechanism 
impacting neurodevelopment. (367, 368).
Phthalates
Phthalates or phthalate esters are esters of phthalic acid 
and mainly used as plasticizers and softeners in various 
commercial products such as furniture, cosmetics, food 
packaging, and medical equipment such as catheters and 
perfusion bags/drips. Phthalates are also one of the most 
volatile EDCs and can be found at high concentrations in 
enclosed spaces where air conditioning is used, such as in 
vehicles (369). One of the most widely used phthalates is 
di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), used as a plasticizer 
in PVC recycling, but not manufacturing. This phthalate 
used in soft medical devices and toys was of major concern 
due to its high migration rate (370) and to the vulnerable 
population in contact with the compound. Consequently 
production was banned and manufacturing ceased by 
BASF in 2002. Other notable common phthalates are 
dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and its metabolite monobutyl 
phthalate (MBP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), 
monoethyl phthalate (MEP), benzylbutylphthalate (BBP), 
diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and diisononyl phthalate 
(DINP). Alternatives to phthalate such as hexamoll Dinch 
are now being used in medical devices. A transgenerational 
study carried out by BASF in 2005, unpublished but 
described in EFSA 2006 (371) and NICNAS 2012 (372) 
reports, showed significant hepatic effects and thyroid 
hyperplasia induced by Dinch (372).
Phthalates do not bio-accumulate in the environment 
but since they are ubiquitous in our daily life, the 
potential of consequences of continuous exposure has 
raised concerns. Current EU legislation focuses on levels 
in children’s toys. Some phthalates (DEHP, BBP and DBP) 
cannot be used in toys and childcare products. Other 
phthalates (DINP and DIDP) are banned only from toys 
that could be potentially placed in mouth. Urinary levels 
of phthalates serve as a good biomarker and high exposure 
levels have been found in the general public, including 
pregnant women (373, 374, 375, 376, 377).
In humans, DEHP and its metabolites measured 
in maternal urine have been associated with adverse 
neurodevelopment and behaviour in offspring (378, 379, 
380, 381, 382). Interestingly, the phthalate metabolites, 
MEHHP, MEOHP and MBP were associated with both 
mental and behaviour defects in male but not female 
infants of 6 months (378). Prenatal exposure to phthalates 
has also been associated with ‘reduced masculine play’ 
among boys of 3- to 6-year (383). In contrast, Téllez-Rojo 
et al. reported lower scores on the mental developmental 
index (Bayley’s test) in females but not males at 2–3 years

(380). These sex-specific differences seem to attenuate with 
age (7–9 age) (384). More studies are needed to determine 
if gender differences are found as a function of phthalate 
exposure in older children. While these previous studies 
have focused on cognitive and behavioural defects during 
early years, other studies have found association between 
phthalates and more severe neurodevelopmental defects 
during school ages such a reduced IQ (385) and attention-
deficit disorder (ADD) (386).
As for a number of pesticides, these negative effects 
on brain development can be linked to changes in TH 
levels. In pregnant women, urinary MBP, MEP and MEHP 
have been associated with low serum T4 and fT4 during 
the second trimester (387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392). 
These inverse relationships between MEHP and DEHP 
and T4 levels have been reported in the adult population 
including men (59, 393). In children, there are varying 
reports of levels of phthalates and its effect on TH levels. 
Some report inverse relations between the two (388, 
394), others a positive relation (59), and one that relied 
on a relatively small cohort found none at all (395). This 
highlights the importance of study design, age group, 
sample size, and exposure profiles when studying non-
persistent chemicals.
Since DBP down-regulates the human NIS promoter 
(396), modulating the transcriptional activity of NIS may 
be one of the underlying causes of thyroid hyperactivity 
and decreased circulating T4 concentrations. DBP also 
appears to act as a thyroid antagonist when assessed 
through reporter gene assays (397). Zebrafish and male 
rats exposed to varying concentrations for MEHP and 
DEHP respectively demonstrate similar low levels of 
whole body T4 levels (398, 399). It is interesting to note 
that in 2017, ECHA classified DPB, DEHP, BBP and DIBP 
as substances of high concern due to their endocrine-
disrupting properties.
Perfluorinated compounds
Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) are widely used in the 
manufacture of fabrics, carpets, surfactants, emulsifiers, 
Teflon, lubricants, cosmetics, and fire-fighting foams. 
They are commonly used as surfactants due to their fully 
fluorinated linear carbon chain attached to a hydrophilic 
head. Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface 
tension between two liquids or between a liquid and a 
solid and therefore are used in detergents, wetting agents, 
emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants. They are 
also highly stable and therefore extremely persistent in 
the environment including both wildlife and human 
populations (400). Between the years 2000 and 2002, 
the main producers discontinued production of certain 
PFCs, including perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), 
perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate 
(PFOS). Following its discontinuation, a significant 
decrease in the serum levels of PFOA and PFOS were 
observed (401, 402, 403). However, another factor that 
needs to be taken into consideration is their relatively 
long half-life in humans being approximately 3.8 years for 
PFOA, 5.4 years for PFOS, and 8.5 years for PFHxS (404). 
Despite the ban, they are still found in significant levels 
in drinking water. A 2016 study covering 2/3 of drinking 
water supplies in the United States found unsafe levels of 
PFCs at the minimum reporting levels required by the EPA 
(405). PFOS has been banned in the EU since 2008 but 
there are no restrictions on PFOA and PFHxS. In the USA, 
the EPA launched a voluntary campaign in which the 
companies committed to reduce global facility emissions 
and product content of PFOA and related chemicals by 
2015. The last update for this reduction was in 2013/2014.
Several animals studies have shown low-dose 
exposure of PFCs during neonatal development results 
in irreversible neurotoxic effects and alterations in 
spontaneous behaviour, habituation capability, learning 
and memory (assessed at 4 months) (406, 407). PFCs were 
also shown to alter the levels of synaptophysin and tau 
proteins in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Both 
proteins are important for the formation and growth of 
dopaminergic synapses and alterations in the dopamine 
transporters and receptors are one of the underlying causes 
of behavioural defects such as ADHD (408, 409). Several 
cross-sectional studies have investigated the potential 
association between PFC levels in school-age children and 
ADHD (410, 411). Hoffman et al. (410) reported a positive 
association between levels of PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS with 
ADHD symptoms while Stein and Savitz (411) reported 
an association with only PFHxS. High impulsivity has 
also been reported in children with high PFC levels (412) 
and high levels of PFOS exposure during pregnancy have 
been associated with delayed motor development in the 
first two years of life (413, 414). TH dysfunction is a well-
established risk for ADHD (5, 415, 416, 417, 418).
PFC exposure and TH disruption have also been 
reported in adults. A large study of employees in a PFC 
manufacturer revealed negative associations between 
PFOA and free T4 levels (419). In the US, women with high 
levels of PFOA and men with high levels of PFOS are also 
at increased risk of thyroid diseases (420). Low levels of T4 
as a function of PFC exposure have also been confirmed

in several animal models. A single dose of PFOS in adult 
rats resulted in an initial increased fT4 and decreased TSH 
levels, followed by decrease in total T4 and T3 levels (421). 
In other adult rat studies, PFOA exposure resulted in 
decreased T4 levels (422, 423). Perinatal exposure to PFOS 
also results in decreased levels of T4 in both the mother 
and the offspring (424, 425, 426, 427). A test of twenty-
four PFCs revealed competitive binding of most PFCs to 
TTR (428) which in turn can explain the dysfunctional 
levels of T4 observed in humans and animal models. Of 
the 24 PFCs, PFHxS displayed the highest competitive 
binding followed by PFOA and PFOS equally. PFOS has 
also been shown to decrease hepatic Dio1 mRNA while 
increasing thyroidal Dio1 mRNA (429). Whether this is a 
direct effect on Dio1 transcription or a response to levels 
of T4, is not yet clear.
Conclusion
The above review covers the main categories of chemicals 
that affect thyroid signalling. However, we have not 
reported environmental and human levels of exposure 
for each chemical class or effects of mixtures. There 
are wide variations in exposure to individual chemical 
exposure due to geographical location and legislation of 
the country of residence. Moreover, as we are exposed 
to multiple chemicals at a given time, it is increasingly 
important to address the effect of chemicals as a mixture, 
since synergistic effects of chemical mixtures without 
individual effects have been reported (430, 431). Our 
laboratory has shown that exposure to mixtures of 
common chemicals found in human amniotic fluid, alter 
TH signalling, brain structure and behaviour (432, 433). 
Together, these findings highlight the current impact of 
EDC exposure on neurodevelopment and argue for rapid 
public health intervention.
