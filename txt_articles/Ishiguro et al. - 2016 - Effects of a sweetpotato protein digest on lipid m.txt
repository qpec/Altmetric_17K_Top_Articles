Abstract
Sweetpotato peptide (SPP) was prepared by enzyme digestion of sweetpotato protein
from starch wastewater. Animal experiments assessed the effect of SPP on body
weight, abdominal adipose tissue mass, serum lipids and adipocytokines. Body and
liver weight and epididymal and mesenteric fat of mice fed a high-fat diet containing
0.5% or 5% SPP for 28 days were significantly lower than control mice. Triglyceride
and cholesterol in VLDL and LDL and leptin levels were significantly lower in the
serum of SPP-administered mice compared to control mice. Biomarker arrays
showed that adiponectin, melanocyte-stimulating-hormone-alpha and neuromedin U
were more than 1.5 times higher, while TNF-alpha was about 1.5 times lower in the
livers of SPP-administered mice compared to control mice. These results suggest SPP
mitigated leptin resistance in mice administered a high-fat diet, and maintained
anorexigenic peptide levels. SPP administration may suppress lipogenesis by
increasing adiponectin levels and decreasing TNF-alpha levels in adipocytes.

 1. Introduction
Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas L.) roots are not only used for human consumption,
they are used to make starch materials, processed foods, and distilled spirits in
Japan. Starch use accounts for about 15% (131,500 tons) of total sweetpotato
production. Starch residues are discharged during starch production and are mainly
used in animal feed and compost. Large amounts of the wastewater, which can
cause serious environmental problems, are discarded after clarification. Investiga-
tion into the uses of the by-products of the sweetpotato starch industry would
benefit both the environment and industry.
Sweetpotato has a high nutritional value and phytochemical composition
(Mohanraj and Sivasankar, 2014). Proteins, sugars, polyphenols and water-soluble
polysaccharides derived from sweetpotato are discharged into the wastewater.
Water-soluble polysaccharides from sweetpotato are reported to possess immu-
nostimulatory activity (Zhao et al., 2005). A sweetpotato protein was previously
shown to have a high amino acid score and anti-diabetic effects (Ishiguro et al.,
2008). In addition, we previously prepared a sweetpotato protein digest
(sweetpotato peptide, SPP) with angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory
activity and demonstrated its hypotensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive
rats (SHR) (Ishiguro et al., 2012). Peptides isolated from food proteins have shown
various health benefits, such as antioxidation (Zhang et al., 2010), amelioration of
glucose tolerance (Otani et al., 2009), inhibition of HIV protease (Yust et al., 2004)
and hypocholesterolemic effects (Liu et al., 1994), as well as hypotensive effects
(Fujita et al., 2001). Investigation of SPP will provide valuable data on any health
benefits.
In this study, we investigated the effects of SPP on weight gain, lipid accumulation
and hyperlipidemia; the profile of serum cholesterol and triglyceride in sub-
fractionated lipoprotein; serum leptin and adiponectin levels; and the expression
levels of obesity related biomarkers, such as adipocytokine and anorexigenic
peptides in the livers of high-fat diet-administered mice.

2.1. Materials
Three proteases were kindly donated by Daiwa Kasei K.K. (Hyogo, Japan) and
Amano Enzyme Inc. (Aichi, Japan).
2.2. Preparation of a sweetpotato peptide (SPP)
SPP was prepared as previously described (Ishiguro et al., 2012) with slight
modification: sweetpotato roots (cv. Shiroyutaka for starch production, 240 kg)
were squeezed, without the addition of water, by an attritor fitted with a centrifugal

 dehydrator (Seno Iron Works Co., Ltd., Hokkaido, Japan). Residue was pressed
using a screw press separator (PSS4-J, Nippon Engineering Corporation, Fukuoka,
Japan) and the extract was added to the squeezed juice from the centrifugal
dehydrator. The starch was separated from the squeezed juice by continuous
centrifugal separation in a centrifugal separator (HS-324L, IHI Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan). Proteins were collected from the supernatant, corresponding to the
wastewater, by isoelectric focusing precipitation. The supernatant was adjusted to
pH 4.5, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (LAPX 404SGP-31, Alfa
Laval, Sweden). The precipitate (6.0 kg), including sweetpotato protein, was freeze
dried and kept at −30 °C until use. One hundred and fifty grams of freeze dried
precipitate was added to 15 L of pure water. The protein solution was digested with
three proteases, Thermoase PC10F (Daiwa Kasei, Hyogo, Japan) (1.5 g), Protease S
(Amano Enzyme, Aichi, Japan) (15 g), and Proleather FG-F (Amano Enzyme, Aichi,
Japan) (15 g); these were selected because of their high protein degradation and ACE
inhibitory activity. The protein solution was adjusted to pH 8.5, and the enzyme
reaction was conducted at 65 °C for 16 h. The digest was then boiled for 30 min to
inactivate the enzymes. The digest was filtered using activated carbon and spray-
dried. The dried digest (SPP) was used in the animal experiments.
2.3. Animal experiments
Animal experiments were performed by Skylight Biotech Inc. at Akita University
(Akita, Japan). Mice were maintained at a room temperature of 23 ± 2 °C and
relative humidity of 55 ± 5% under a 12 h light-dark cycle. Five-week-old male
C57BL/6 mice (Japan SLC, Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) were fed High Fat Diet 32
(CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) (Table 1) and acclimatized for 1 week. Mice
were divided into three groups consisting of five animals, according to body
weight. The levels of serum cholesterol and triglyceride in mice were not
significantly different between the three groups at the beginning of the experiment.
The control group was fed High Fat Diet 32, and test groups were fed High Fat
Diet 32 containing SPP at a concentration of 5% (w/w) or 0.5% (w/w). Food and
sterile water were available ad libitum. All mice were assessed to be in good health
throughout the experiments and no forms of toxicity were observed in mice
administered SPP. Twenty eight days after initiation of the test diets, body weight
was measured and blood samples for the measurement of cholesterol, triglyceride,
leptin and adiponectin were obtained from the heart under ketamin anesthesia. The
mice were fasted from 22:00 h the day before and sampling was conducted at
10:00 h. After blood sampling, liver, mesenteric fat and epididymal fat were
isolated and weighed. Serum samples and livers were stored at −80 °C until use.
The animals were treated according to the “Guidelines for Proper Conduct of
Animal Experiments” (Science Council of Japan). The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Akita University.

 2.4. Measurements of serum cholesterol, triglyceride, leptin and
adiponectin
Total cholesterol, triglyceride, leptin and adiponectin were measured 28 days after
the start of the experiment. Total cholesterol and triglyceride was measured using
Cholestest CHO and Cholostest TG (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan), respectively. Serum leptin and adiponectin levels were measured using a
Mouse Leptin ELISA Kit (Morinaga Institute of Biological Science, Yokohama,
Japan) and a Mouse/Rat Adiponection ELISA Kit (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), respectively.
2.5. Serum lipoprotein analysis by HPLC
The cholesterol and triglyceride profiles in serum lipoproteins were analyzed by an
online dual enzymatic method using HPLC with two tandem connected TSKgel
LipopropakXL columns (300 × 7.8 mm; Tosho, Japan) at Skylight Biotech Inc.
(Akita, Japan), according to the procedure described by Usui et al., 2002. The
concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride were determined in four fractioned
groups according to lipoprotein particle size (diameter) (Fig. 1), chylomicron (CM,
>80 nm), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL, 30–80 nm), low density lipoprotein
(LDL, 16–30 nm), and high density lipoprotein (HDL, 8–16 nm), using enzymatic
reagents (Kyowa Medex, Tokyo Japan). The concentrations of cholesterol and
triglyceride were further analyzed in twenty sub-fractioned groups of CM (G01 and
02), VLDL (G03-05: large VLDL, G06: medium VLDL, G07: small VLDL), LDL
(G08: large LDL, G09: medium LDL, G10: small LDL, G11-13: very small LDL)

2.6. Obesity peptide biomarker array analysis
The obesity peptide biomarker array analysis for mouse/rat (Phoenix Pharmaceu-
ticals, Inc., CA, USA) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction
at Filgen Inc. (Nagoya, Japan). The liver tissues of a mouse selected from each
group after 28 days administration of the high-fat diet containing SPP were
isolated. The array consists of 44 different biomarkers: ACTH, adiponectin, ADM,
AGRP, amylin, apelin-36, autotaxin, bombesin, CART, CCK, CGRP, CRF,
desnutrin, dynorphin A, endorphin-beta, ghrelin, GHRF, GLP-1, GLP-2, glucagon,

control. The data was the average of two replications and the values are the ratio of
the expression intensities of biomarkers derived from livers of 0.5% or 5% SPP
administered mice to control mice.
2.7. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses of differences between the control group and the groups that
received SPP were conducted using the multiple comparison test of Dunnet.
3. Results
3.1. Animal experiments
Animal experiments were performed to assess the effect of SPP on body weight,
abdominal adipose tissue mass, serum lipids and adipocytokines. The body weight
of male C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet containing 5% SPP was significantly
lower than control mice, although food intake was not statistically different in all
groups after 28 days administration (Table 2). Liver weight and epididymal fat
were significantly lower in the 0.5% (P < 0.05) and 5% (P < 0.01) SPP-
administered groups compared with the control group (Table 2). Mesenteric fat
was significantly lower in the 5% (P < 0.01) SPP-administered group compared

 with the control (Table 2). Fatty liver was identified in control mice (moderately in
3 animals and slightly in 2 animals) and in 0.5% SPP-administered mice
(moderately in 2 animals and slightly in 3 animals) according to the autopsy report.
No mice in the 5% SPP-administered group were diagnosed with a fatty liver (data
not shown).
Serum total cholesterol levels were not statistically different among any groups
after 28 days administration of a high-fat diet containing SPP. The serum
triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the 0.5% (P < 0.05) and 5% (P <
0.01) SPP-administered group compared with the control (Table 3). There were no
significant differences in serum adiponectin levels, while serum leptin levels were
significantly lower in the 5% (P < 0.01) SPP-administered group compared with
the control (Table 3). These results indicate that SPP prevents body weight gain,
lipid accumulation in the fatty tissue and any elevations in serum triglyceride and
leptin levels in mice fed a high-fat diet.
3.2. Cholesterol and triglyceride profiles in serum lipoproteins
Cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum lipoproteins, CM, VLDL, LDL and
HDL, after 28 days administration of a high-fat diet containing SPP were analyzed
by HPLC. Cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the SPP-administered
group compared with the control in serum VLDL and LDL (Fig. 1A). Triglyceride
levels were also lower in the SPP-administered group compared with the control in
serum VLDL, LDL and HDL (Fig. 1B). Cholesterol and triglyceride profiles were
further analyzed in 20 sub-fractioned groups of CM, VLDL, LDL and HDL.
Cholesterol levels were lower in the serum of SPP-administered mice compared
with the control mice in G04-G06 (large VLDL and medium VLDL), G11-15 (very

 small LDL and very large HDL) and G16-G18 (large, medium and small HDL)
(Fig. 2A). SPP dose-dependent responses in cholesterol levels were observed, in
particular, in very small LDL (G11-13). Triglyceride levels were considerably
lower in the serum of SPP-administered mice in fractions G03-G08 (large, medium
and small VLDL and large LDL) (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the
reductions in triglyceride and cholesterol levels by SPP was dependent on the
particle size in serum lipoproteins.
3.3. Metabolic disease related biomarker array analysis
In order to evaluate the effect of SPP on factors related to metabolic diseases,
biomarker array analysis was performed. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH),
adiponectin, KISS-1, melanocyte-stimulating-hormone-alpha (MSH-alpha), nesfa-
tin, neuromedin U, neuropeptide W-23 (NPW-23), orexin A and resistin were more
than 1.5 times higher in the liver of 0.5% and/or 5% SPP-administered mice
compared to the control mice. TNF-alpha and desnutrin were about 1.5 times lower
in the 0.5% or 5% SPP-administered mice compared to the control mice (Table 4).
These results suggest that SPP administration ameliorates the abnormality of
secretion of some adipocytokines and neuropeptides related to appetite, and
contributes to the control of lipid metabolism in mice fed a high-fat diet.
4. Discussion
Visceral adipose tissue accumulation is an important risk factor of metabolic and
cardiovascular disorders (Bastard et al., 2006). Increased low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) or decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
and increased triglyceride are widely known risk factors of coronary heart disease
(CHD) (Okazaki et al., 2005). A previous study showed that the visceral fat area
positively correlated with very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and
LDL-C in 62 male subjects (Okazaki et al., 2006). In this study, we demonstrated
that body weight gain, accumulation of visceral fat and fatty liver symptoms were
suppressed in mice administered a SPP diet (Table 2). Serum VLDL-C and LDL-C
levels were significantly lower in SPP-administered mice compared to control mice
(Fig. 1A), although serum total cholesterol was not significantly different among
the groups (Table 3). Triglyceride, which is abundant in VLDL, was also clearly
lower in SPP-administered groups compared with the control (Fig. 1B). These
results suggest an intriguing possibility that SPP has the potential to mitigate
hyperlipidemia and obesity.
The profiles of 20 lipoprotein sub-fractions from the serum of mice fed a high-fat
diet suggested SPP had a dose-dependent effect on cholesterol levels, especially in
very small LDL (G11-13) (Fig. 2A). The predominance of small, dense LDL has
been accepted as an important cardiovascular risk factor (Lamarche et al., 1997;

 Superko and Gadesam, 2008) and characteristic of the dyslipidemic state seen in
type 2 diabetes (Qiu et al., 2007). A relationship between predominance of small,
dense LDL particles, high triglyceride levels and low HDL-C concentrations and
cardiovascular diseases have been reported (Austin et al., 1990; Campos et al.,
1992; Okazaki et al., 2006). Our results suggest SPP may be advantageous in
subjects with lipid abnormalities and heart disease by reducing the levels of
VLDL-C, very small LDL-C and VLDL-triglyceride.
Lipid and sugar metabolism is maintained by various adipocytokines and
neuropeptides related to food intake. Leptin is an anorexigenic adipocytokine,
primarily secreted by adipocyte cells. Plasma leptin levels are elevated in subjects
who are overweight, suggesting obesity may be associated with leptin resistance
(Schwartz et al., 1996). Leptin also influences the activity of various orexigenic

 and anorexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus (Klok et al., 2006). Leptin
resistance disrupts hypothalamic control of energy homeostasis, which results in
obesity and increased lipid production (Yang and Barouch, 2007). MSH-alpha
decreases body fat in humans, regulates energy balance, appetite control and
glucose transport in rat adipocytes (Miller et al., 2003). MSH-alpha, together with
ACTH and endorphin-beta, are synthesized by proteolytic processing of the
proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor in the pituitary and brain: POMC levels
are increased by leptin (Yang and Barouch, 2007). Neuromedin U is also a
hypothalamic neuropeptide, that regulates body weight through the effects of
anorexigenic activity and energy expenditure, independent of the leptin signaling
pathway (Hanada et al., 2004). Adiponectin plays an important role in metabolic
regulation processes in various tissues: it suppresses gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis
and triglyceride levels in the liver (Ruan and Dong, 2016). TNF-alpha, a
proinflammatory cytokine, is increased in the adipose tissue of obese mice and
subjects (Puglisi and Fernandez, 2008). TNF-alpha reduces adiponectin expression
and induces the overproduction of VLDL particles, which might explain its direct
relationship with serum triglycerides (Qin et al., 2008). The secretion of TNF-alpha
is stimulated by leptin (Yang and Barouch, 2007). In our study, serum leptin levels
were dose-dependently suppressed in SPP-administered mice after 28 days
administration of a high-fat diet containing SPP (Table 3). In addition, biomarkers
associated with obesity and lipid abnormality were increased in the livers of SPP-
administered mice, in particular, the levels of adiponectin, MSH-alpha and
neuromedin U were more than 1.5 times higher in both the 0.5% and 5% SPP-
administered groups compared with the control (Table 4). TNF-alpha was about
1.5 times lower in the 5% SPP-administered group compared with the control
group (Table 4). These results suggest that SPP mitigated leptin resistance in mice
administered a high-fat diet, and maintained anorexigenic peptide levels, such as
MSH-alpha and neuromedin U. SPP administration may suppress lipogenesis and
triglyceride levels by increasing adiponectin levels and decreasing TNF-alpha
levels in adipocyte tissues.
There are many reports of enzyme digests derived from food protein with activities
which potentially prevent lifestyle diseases: angiotensin I-converting enzyme
inhibition (Suetsuna, 1998; Fujita et al., 2001; Yonekura and Tanaka, 2003),
vasorelaxing activity (Yoshikawa et al., 2000), hypocholesterolemic activity
(Yoshikawa et al., 2000; Liyanage et al., 2008; Liu et al., 1994), immunostimulat-
ing activity (Yoshikawa et al., 2000), antioxidation (Zhang et al., 2010),
amelioration of glucose tolerance (Otani et al., 2009) and inhibition of HIV
protease (Yust et al., 2004). We report that SPP, derived from sweetpotato, might
contribute to the amelioration of lipid abnormality and have identified four
peptides, I-T-P, G-Q-Y, I-I-P and S-T-Y-Q-T, which may be responsible for the
activity. Further research into the roles of these peptides are required.

 5. Conclusion
SPP was prepared from sweetpotato starch wastewater using a combination of three
proteases. SPP inhibited body weight gain, visceral fat gain and alleviation of fatty
liver symptoms. In addition, SPP lowered the levels of triglyceride, very small LDL-
C and VLDL-C in serum. The involvement of SPP in the regulation of expression of
anorexigenic neuropeptides and adipocytokines was experimentally inferred. It is
expected that SPP could be used as a functional food material for people with
metabolic disorders. However, the administration level of SPP would be required for
human health is uncertain at this study. Human intervention studies are needed for
confirmation of the effect of SPP administration on the disorder of lipid metabolism.
