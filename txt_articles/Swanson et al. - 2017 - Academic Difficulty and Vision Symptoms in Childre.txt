Abstract
Purpose—Academic difficulty is reported in children with prolonged post-concussive symptoms. 
Despite growing evidence that vestibular-ocular and vision-specific dysfunction are common in 
children following concussion, vision is rarely mentioned in return-to-learn protocols. The purpose 
of this project was to evaluate a cohort of children with prolonged post-concussive symptoms to 
determine if vision symptoms are associated with those reporting academic difficulty.
Methods—Data was obtained from the Children’s of Alabama Concussion Clinic REDCap 
dataset from the period January 2007 to October 2013. From this dataset of 1,033 concussion 
events, a cohort of 276 children aged 5–18 years with three or more concussion-related symptoms 
present for 10 days or more was identified. A cross-sectional cohort study was undertaken to 
evaluate the association of concussion symptoms, SCAT2 scores, demographic and concussion 
severity markers to reported educational difficulty among children with prolonged post-concussive 
symptoms. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression techniques were used to model the 
association of reported educational difficulty to self-reported vision abnormalities.
Results—Mean age was 13.8 years. Median time since the concussive event was 21 days, with 
33% (95/276) reporting their concussion more than thirty days prior to data collection. Academic 
difficulty was reported by 29% (79/270) and vision abnormalities in 46% (128/274). After model 
reduction, vision symptoms (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.02, 4.62), hearing disturbance (OR 2.39, 95% CI 
1.06, 5.36) and concentration difficulty (OR 21.62, 95% CI 9.50, 44.47) remained associated with 
academic difficulty. For those with symptoms 30 days or more after concussion, only vision (OR 
3.15, 95% CI 1.06, 9.38) and concentration difficulty (OR 15.33, 95% CI 4.99, 47.05) remained 
statistically significant.
Conclusions—Vision problems were commonly reported in children with concussions and were 
independently associated with those reporting academic difficulty. Comprehensive vision

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported that between the years 2001 and 2009, the 
estimated rate of childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI) visits to an emergency department 
increased by 57% from 190 to 298 per 100,000,1 CDC data also indicate that children are 
more likely than any other group to present to emergency departments with concussions.2 
Fortunately, the majority of concussions resolve within 7 to 10 days without complications.3 
Reports of symptoms lingering longer than a month in the pediatric population vary widely 
from 1 to 38%, with longer duration often resulting in academic difficulty.4–9 In a sample of 
children with concussion aged 5 to 18 years, a majority of children who were symptomatic 
for more than four weeks were prescribed school accommodations and reported a decline in 
grades.10 The same children required a median time of over one month to return to school 
without accommodations and a median time of over two months before they were symptom-
free.10
In the immediate aftermath of a concussion, the current standard treatment is a prescribed 
period of “cognitive rest.”11 Following cognitive rest, two main concerns remain dominant: 
when it is appropriate to “return to learn” and when it is appropriate to “return to play.” In 
the interest of the safety of athletes, extensive literature has developed around “return-to-
play” guidelines. The backbone of this literature is the Zurich Consensus Report, which 
provided guidelines for return to play and has received widespread adoption.3 “Return to 
learn” has received less attention. In a survey submitted to athletic trainers in all NCAA 
member institutions, 97% of respondents had return-to-play policies, while only 63% 
reported having return-to-learn policies.12
In order to develop return-to-learn protocols, it is important to understand which symptoms 
are associated with academic difficulty. There is growing literature that the vestibular system 
is affected in children with concussion.13,14 Not surprisingly, there have also been reports of 
alterations in the vestibular-ocular responses in a majority of children with concussion.15,16 
Referral to vestibular therapy in children with prolonged symptoms is common.17,18 
However, despite growing evidence that also non-vestibular oculomotor vision tasks, 
including convergence, accommodation, saccadic transfers of gaze, and smooth-pursuit 
tracking are affected in a majority of children.19–24 and that children with convergence 
insufficiency have greater total symptom scores,24 vision is rarely mentioned in return-to-
learn protocols.11,25–27 Just over one third of responding athletic trainers from the NCAA 
reported testing Snellen visual acuity and fewer than 5% reported testing saccadic eye 
movements with King-Devick.12 The 2014 National Athletic Trainers’ Position Statement 
recommended testing smooth pursuits, nystagmus, and pupil reflex and did not include 
convergence and accommodation testing, or comprehensive eye tracking evaluations in the 
recommended assessment protocols.28

 Given the prevalence of vestibular, vestibular-ocular, and vision-specific dysfunction in 
children following concussion, there is potential to include both vestibular and vision 
assessments in return-to-learn protocols. The purpose of this project was to evaluate a cohort 
of children with prolonged post-concussive symptoms to determine if vision symptoms are 
associated with increased academic difficulty.
METHODS
Data Set
Children’s of Alabama (COA) is the only dedicated children’s hospital in the state of 
Alabama and is one of the largest children’s healthcare facilities in the country. The hospital 
supports more than 600,000 outpatient visits annually.29 In 2007, the faculty and staff of 
COA recognized the potential impact of concussion on their patients and began 
systematically collecting data on consecutive cases of children who presented to the hospital 
with a concussion. From 2007 to 2011, these children were evaluated by a group of 
physicians affiliated with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) departments of 
sports medicine, neurosurgery, neurology, and emergency medicine. Only data from children 
with a COA physician-diagnosed concussion were entered into the database system. Similar 
to many other states, Alabama passed mandatory concussion evaluation legislation in 2011. 
In Alabama, this law covers both recreational and state-supported athletic programs. It 
mandates that children with a suspected concussion occurring during practice or a game be 
immediately removed from play and medically cleared by a physician before returning to 
play. This law has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of children being diagnosed 
with concussion in the state. To respond to this increased need, COA began a specialized 
multidisciplinary clinic for the evaluation and treatment of children with concussion in 
August 2011. Data available after August 2011 is directly from the COA Concussion Clinic. 
Typical entry points into the concussion clinic are from COA Emergency Department or by 
referral from pediatricians and primary medical care specialists within the community.
Information included in the dataset is collected from both parents and children at the point-
of-care. This data includes general demographic information, concussion event history, prior 
medical history, symptom history, and results from the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 
2 (SCAT 2).30 Data collected at both the concussion clinic and in that collected prior to 
formal concussion clinic founding have been stored in the Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap) management system.
Analysis
A cross-sectional study nested within a cohort follow-up was undertaken to evaluate the 
association of concussion symptoms to reported educational difficulties among children with 
prolonged post-concussive symptoms. Data were obtained from the Children’s of Alabama 
Concussion dataset from the period January 2007 to October 2013. During this time frame, 
1021 children were evaluated with 1,033 concussion events. As part of the data collected 
each parent/subject dyad was asked to define the date on which the current concussion 
occurred (index date). For each subject the data analyzed was from the first COA clinic visit 
after the index date. Data collected included questions about thirteen symptoms typically

 associated with a concussion. From this series of questions and time since index date, a 
subset of children with prolonged post-concussive symptoms was identified. Prolonged 
symptoms were defined as having three or more concussion symptoms present for 10 days 
or more after an acute concussive event. The subset was limited to children 5 to 18 years of 
age. A total of 276 children met these entry criteria. Our primary symptom of interest was 
reported vision problems. The University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review 
Board approval was granted for this project and all data collection and analysis followed the 
tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
A yes/no question within the dataset specifically asked if the child was having academic 
difficulty after the concussive event. The response to this question was used as the dependent 
variable. Other variables of interest were demographic history, age at the time of concussion, 
race, gender, and insurance type. Race was categorized as a three level variable of white, 
black and other. Socio-economic status was not available and insurance type was included as 
a proxy. More than two-thirds of the general clinical population at COA qualifies for public 
assistance insurance (Medicaid and Alabama Child Health Insurance Program) due to 
financial status. Insurance was coded as public, private, or none. Glasgow Coma Scale 
scores were not available from the date of injury; however, three questions were available 
which gave an indication of concussion severity: whether loss of consciousness occurred, 
whether neuro-imaging was ordered, and whether there was amnesia associated with the 
event. The Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT-2) is a multidimensional instrument 
which captures severity on a 1–6 scale about 22 concussion-related symptoms. It also 
includes the Glasgow Coma Scale Score results, the Maddock’s sideline assessment, a brief 
physical assessment, a cognitive assessment, and a balance assessment. SCAT2 data 
available within the dataset included an overall SCAT score, and subset scores for 
symptoms, the symptom severity score, the cognitive sub-score and the balance sub-score. 
The total SCAT2 score is scaled such that higher scores indicate better performance. For the 
symptom subscale, the number of symptoms present is subtracted from 22 to give the final 
symptom score (see Table 1). For consistency in this report Symptom Scale score refers to 
22 minus the number of symptoms. The cognitive assessment and balance subscales are 
treated similarly with errors subtracted from a best possible score of 30 for each. In contrast, 
the symptom severity is scored with higher numbers indicating worse symptomatology with 
a maximum possible of 132.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression techniques were used to model the association 
of vision and reported academic difficulty. All demographic, symptom, and event variables 
univariately associated (Table 1) with academic difficulty were entered into a multivariate 
model. Backward stepwise regression was used for variable retention. Those with p value 
<=0.1 were retained in the subsequent models. Independent variable reduction was done till 
the fewest number of significant variables in a stable model was achieved. Akaike 
Information Criterion (AIC) and concordance c were used to compare models.31 
Concordance c provides an area under the receiver operator curve for logistic regression 
models while a 2 units reduction in AIC is consistent with an improved model.31 Given that 
there is no clear time frame for defining post-concussion syndrome, models were repeated 
for those with symptoms present longer than 30 days. Since the overall SCAT2 score is a 
composite of sub-scale scores, separate models were completed for the SCAT2 and each

 univariately associated sub-scale score. Post-hoc analyses of non-parametric correlations 
with the variable concentration difficulty were done. All analysis was done in SAS version 
9.4.
RESULTS
Mean age of the children in this cohort was approximately 14 (SD± 2.7). The overwhelming 
majority were aged 11 and older (84%). Racial characteristics were representative of the 
area’s population with the majority being white. Males (63%) were overrepresented. A much 
higher percentage of those in this cohort had private insurance than is seen in the hospital’s 
general population. This is suggestive that this cohort has a higher socio-economic status 
than is typical for COA. Mean number of days since the concussive event was 43(SD±63) 
days with the median 21(range 11–397). Ninety-five children (34%) reported experiencing a 
concussion more than thirty days prior to intake with the most remote about 13 months prior. 
Two outliers with concussion 731 and 949 days prior to intake were removed for analysis as 
these were significantly different than the remainder of the cohort and may not represent the 
typical clinical patient. In analyses, their exclusion had no impact on the results.
For the majority of the sample, the presenting concussion was their first treated at the COA; 
however, almost 30% (75/271) reported experiencing one or more prior concussions. Loss of 
consciousness (25%), amnesia at around the time of the event (32.6%), and having neuro-
imaging at the time of the acute event (21%) were relatively infrequent, consistent with most 
of this cohort having a mild TBI. Full scale SCAT scores were available for 87% (240/276), 
while subscales had a significantly higher amount of missing data (range 107–109 subjects). 
The mean number of symptoms (22-symptom scale score) for those with documented SCAT 
symptom subscale scores was 9 (SD ±6.7). The mean symptom severity scale was 24 (SD 
±26). Coupled together with symptom numbers, this indicates that the majority of children 
reported having multiple relatively low severity symptoms. The general cohort 
characteristics are found in Table 1.
Academic difficulty at the time of the intake was reported by 29% (79/270). It was slightly 
more common among children under age 11(33%) compared to those 11 and older (28%). 
Headaches were by far the most common post-concussive symptom, and almost universal in 
this group (98%). This was followed in frequency by dizziness (70%) and a cluster of 
symptoms including fatigue, vision abnormalities, nausea, concentration difficulty each 
having prevalence rates between 40–50%. Balance problems, confusion, hearing 
disturbance, irritability, sleep disturbance, and vomiting were less common and were still 
noted by 20–30%.
In univariate analysis, none of the demographic variables were significantly associated with 
academic difficulty (see Table 1). Among the event severity related variables, only amnesia 
was significantly associated. With the exception of headaches (Table 1), all the symptom 
variables had an association with academic difficulty. Interpretation of the SCAT2 subscale 
scores is tempered by missing data and possible data collection bias. Subjects having 
subscale scores documented were far more likely (40%, p<0.001) to report academic 
difficulty than those with incomplete subscale scores (12%). This likely indicates that

 subscale data was more frequently collected on more symptomatic children. Given this 
caution, the full scale SCAT2 score, the symptom score and symptom severity score were all 
associated with reported academic difficulty. (Table 1) Interestingly, the cognitive and 
balance subscales were non-significant. In contrast, the independently reported symptoms 
concentration difficulty, confusion and balance difficulty were all univariately associated 
with education difficulty.
The SCAT2 full scale, Symptom Scale, and Symptom Severity scores were modeled with 
the event related variable amnesia. Given their co-variance the Symptom Score and Severity 
score were evaluated separately as well as together. In each model amnesia around the time 
of the concussion was strongly associated with reported academic difficulty.(Table 2) The 
association of reported amnesia with academic difficulty was moderated when symptoms 
alone are controlled (OR 3) compared to the Full SCAT score (OR 5.6). As would be 
expected given the scoring algorithms higher SCAT2 full scale and Symptom Scale scores 
were associated with reduced odds of academic difficulty. The Symptom Severity scale is 
reversed (larger number worse) compared to the Symptom Score and Full Scale score and a 
higher symptom severity score was associated with increased odds of academic difficulty 
when modeled with amnesia. Both the Symptom Score and Severity provide an improved 
model compared to the Full scale score, with greater area under the ROC curve(c statistic) 
and better model fit(lower AIC) compared to the Full Scale score. Taken in total, this seems 
to point to specific symptoms as the possible drivers of the association between SCAT2 and 
reported academic difficulty.
All the individual symptoms for those meeting inclusion criteria (3 or more symptoms for 10 
days or more), except headache, were entered into a model with amnesia. (Table 3) After 
reduction, three variables: concentration difficulty, vision difficulty, and hearing disturbance, 
were associated with reported academic problems in the most parsimonious model. The area 
under the ROC curve(c) for the reduced model is almost identical with better fit (AIC) than 
the initial. In the reduced model, vision and hearing were associated with a doubling of the 
odds of academic difficulty. Having both sensory problems appears not to be associated with 
increased odds of academic difficulty. In a sub-analysis, there was no indication of an 
interaction between vision and hearing (p=0.38). While the confidence limits are wide, 
concentration difficulty accounts for the majority of the model correlation with academic 
difficulty, with a 21-fold increase in the estimated odds in the final model. AIC and 
concordance do however indicate model improvement (c=8%, AIC-10) with the addition of 
the sensory variables. Similarly, for those with three symptoms present 30 days or more after 
a concussive event, only vision (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.06, 9.38) and concentration difficulty 
(OR 15.33, 95% CI 4.99, 47.05) remained statistically significant in a reduced model.
Difficulty with concentration intuitively may have many underlying causes and was 
moderately to weakly associated with a number of other symptom related variables. (Table 
4) The strongest correlations were with amnesia around the time of the concussion, 
confusion and the SCAT Symptom Score. Vision difficulty only shows modest correlation 
with concentration difficulty, which may explain why vision is retained in reduced models.

 DISCUSSION
“Return to learn” is an important issue in concussion that would benefit from more 
evidence-based protocols. In this pediatric population, vision problems were independently 
associated with children reporting academic difficulty. This was true for those with 
symptoms persistent more than 10 days and more than 30 days after a concussion event. 
This should come as no surprise as learning is a highly vision-dependent task with more than 
thirty areas within the brain devoted to vision.32 In addition, damage to central vestibular 
pathways may contribute to visual instability with head movement. Reports of vision-related 
symptoms due to mild traumatic brain injury from pressure waves have been available since 
the beginning of the Gulf Wars.22 More recently, this has been extended to non-military mild 
TBI with an emphasis on sports-related concussion.9,19,24,33–34
Reporting of vision symptoms with sports-related concussion is frequently broken down into 
two restrictive components: light sensitivity and blurred vision. This is likely related to 
analyses originating in the SCAT symptom surveys, which have one question each on light 
sensitivity and blurred vision. Post-concussion light sensitivity has been reported in 15–52% 
of pediatric patients, with blurred vision reported in 23–39%.9 Fewer reports are available of 
post-concussion clinical vision assessment post-concussion in children. Master et. al. have 
recently reported almost 70% of children 11–17 seen for clinical evaluation after concussion 
had accommodative, binocular vision or saccadic abnormalities.19 Pearce and colleagues 
have reported that over 40% of their pediatric study population had reduced near point of 
convergence one month after concussion.24 The reported rate of vision symptoms in this 
cohort is consistent with these previous studies. Given that poor near accommodation and 
convergence can cause symptoms of blurred vision, standard Snellen far distance visual 
acuity testing alone may not be capturing intermittent problems occurring with deskwork.
While vision problems appear to play a role in patients reporting academic difficulty, it is 
important to note that the key symptom identified in this study is difficulty with 
concentration. Difficulty with concentration is thought to be related to executive function, 
which involves planning and coordination of purposeful activity. Executive function is in 
turn related to attention. Clinical assessment and laboratory-based evaluations have shown 
that executive function and task attention tasks may be impaired for two months or more 
after concussion in adolescents.33 An association between concussion and Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder is also well documented.34 The direction of this association is 
however less clear.
While there are abundant guidelines on returning to learn after concussion, there is a dearth 
of supporting data. Purcell and colleagues have reported a post-concussion median return-to-
learn time in a group of 8–12 year olds post-concussion of 4.5 days and of 2.5 days in 13–17 
year olds.35 Baker et. al. reported on a cohort of children 13–19 post-concussion looking 
specifically at the issue of difficulty returning to school.36 One-third of their subjects had 
difficulty with return to school. Within this study, initial concussion severity and number of 
symptoms were associated with academic difficulty while demographic variables were not. 
This is consistent with our findings as well. Corwin et. al.’s study of a hospital-based 
concussion clinic found a median return to school part time of 12 days and median complete

 return to school without accommodations of 35 days.10 Almost 75% of subjects in Corwin’s 
study received academic accommodations. The number of patients reporting academic 
difficulty in our cohort were more similar to those in the Baker study.10, 36 In the Corwin 
study, Convergence abnormalities and visual symptoms on oculomotor tasks were associated 
with time to partial return to school, time to complete return to school and time to complete 
clearance in the Corwin study.
The results of this study support an association between vision symptoms and academic 
difficulty after concussion. A number of limitations of this study should be noted. There is 
no universally agreed upon definition of what constitutes post-concussion syndrome.37 Most 
working definitions include three or five symptoms still present a specified time period after 
a concussion. Our choice of three symptoms was based on this commonly used number. Our 
choice of 10 days was based on the typical time period for most concussions to become 
asymptomatic. Other researchers will have equally valid reasons for choosing different 
criteria. Secondly, the symptom surveys are based on self-report. It is unknown how 
subjective reports of vision problems in this group might relate to objective, quantitative data 
from vestibular, oculomotor, and balance tests. Our outcome measure is also self-reported 
and not verified by school system reports. The finding of no association between academic 
difficulties and SCAT cognitive scale and an inverse association with balance is 
counterintuitive. It is possible that these findings are spurious and related to missing SCAT 
data. Finally, although our findings indicate there is an association between vision and 
education difficulty, the direction is not known with certainty. It is possible that children 
with pre-existing vision abnormalities may be more susceptible to academic difficulty after 
concussion.
Return to learn after concussion is a delicate balance between cognitive rest and 
rehabilitation, and the academic success of students, which requires an individualized 
approach. The American Academy of Pediatrics consensus report on returning to learn after 
concussion prominently lists vision as a common problem, which may interfere with return 
to learn.38 No vision specialists, neither optometrists or ophthalmologists, are listed among 
the medical specialists who may be involved in return-to-learn decisions.38 This data and 
other research support vision care providers taking a greater role in the assessment of return-
to-learn readiness and potential rehabilitative needs of children with concussion.
