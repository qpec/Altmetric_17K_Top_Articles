a Titratable Fixed-Ratio
Combination of Insulin Glargine
Plus Lixisenatide in Type 2
Diabetes Inadequately Controlled
on Basal Insulin and Metformin:
The LixiLan-L Randomized Trial
Diabetes Care 2016;39:1972–1980 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-1495
OBJECTIVE
This study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of LixiLan
(iGlarLixi), a novel, titratable, fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine (iGlar)
(100 units) and lixisenatide, compared with iGlar in patients with type 2 diabetes
inadequately controlled on basal insulin with or without up to two oral glucose-
lowering agents.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
After a 6-week run-in when iGlar was introduced and/or further titrated, and oral
antidiabetic drugs other than metformin were stopped, 736 basal insulin-treated
patients (mean diabetes duration 12 years, BMI 31 kg/m2) were randomized 1:1 to
open-label, once-daily iGlarLixi or iGlar, both titrated to fasting plasma
glucose <100 mg/dL (<5.6 mmol/L) up to a maximum dose of 60 units/day. The
primary outcome was change in HbA1c levels at 30 weeks.
RESULTS
HbA1c decreased from 8.5% (69 mmol/mol) to 8.1% (65 mmol/mol) during the
run-in period. After randomization, iGlarLixi showed greater reductions in HbA1c
from baseline compared with iGlar (–1.1% vs. –0.6%, P < 0.0001), reaching a mean
final HbA1c of 6.9% (52 mmol/mol) compared with 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) for iGlar.
HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) was achieved in 55% of iGlarLixi patients compared
with 30% on iGlar. Mean body weight decreased by 0.7 kg with iGlarLixi and
increased by 0.7 kg with iGlar (1.4 kg difference, P < 0.0001). Documented symp-
tomatic hypoglycemia (£70 mg/dL) was comparable between groups. Mild gas-
trointestinal adverse effects were very low but more frequent with iGlarLixi.
CONCLUSIONS
Compared with iGlar, a substantially higher proportion of iGlarLixi-treated
patients achieved glycemic targets with a beneficial effect on body weight, no
additional risk of hypoglycemia, and low levels of gastrointestinal adverse effects
in inadequately controlled, basal insulin-treated, long-standing type 2 diabetes.

 Recommendations from the American Di-
abetes Association and the European As-
sociation forthe Study of Diabetessuggest
that if HbA1c targets are not achieved de-
spite the addition of basal insulin in type 2
diabetes (1), treatment should be further
advanced to combination injectable ther-
apy with the progressive addition of pran-
dial rapid-acting insulin or the addition
of a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor ago-
nist (GLP-1 RA) (1,2).
Indeed, the combination of basal in-
sulin with a GLP-1 RA has attracted sig-
nificant interest recently, based on the
complementary effects of these individ-
ual therapies and the potential for miti-
gating barriers to their individual use.
Basal insulin therapy improves fasting
plasma glucose (FPG) and nocturnal hy-
poglycemia (3), whereas GLP-1 RAs, espe-
cially the short-acting compounds, have a
significant effect on postprandial plasma
glucose (PPG) (4–9). When combined
with basal insulin, GLP-1 RAs do not in-
crease the risks of hypoglycemia and can
mitigate the weight gain observed with
insulin therapy (4,6–9); GLP-1 RAs do,
however, presentariskofgastrointestinal
adverse events (AEs), leading to frequent
discontinuations (10).
Lixisenatide (Lixi) (Lyxumia; Sanofi,
Paris, France) is a once-daily, prandial
GLP-1 RA with a predominant PPG-
lowering effect brought about mainly
by delaying gastric emptying and reduc-
ing glucagon release (11). The comple-
mentary effects of Lixi administered
with basal insulin as separate injections
have been demonstrated in the GetGoal
clinical trial program (7–9). In particular,
in the GetGoal Duo-2 trial (12), which
assessed patients with type 2 diabetes
inadequately controlled on basal insulin,
with or without 1–3 oral antidiabetic
drugs (OADs), Lixi added to basal iGlar
(100 units), with or without metformin,
produced clinically meaningful improve-
ments in glycemic control, with less hy-
poglycemia and weight gain compared
with prandial insulin given as basal-plus
or basal-bolus regimens.
iGlarLixi is a titratable, fixed-ratio
combination of iGlar and Lixi delivered
via a single, daily injection. In this trial,
iGlarLixi was administered using two
pens: one with a ratio of 2 units of iGlar
to 1 mg of Lixi (pen A) and another with a
ratio of 3 units of iGlar to 1 mg of Lixi
(pen B), allowing for delivery of iGlar
over a range of 10 to 60 units/day while
ensuring that the Lixi dose did not exceed
the recommended dose of 20 mg/day.
In addition, the titratable combination
allowed a gradual increase in dose of the
Lixi component, offering the potential to
attenuate the gastrointestinal AEs seen
with GLP-1 RAs.
The LixiLan-L phase III trial described
here compares the effects of the titrat-
able, fixed-ratio combination iGlarLixi
with iGlar in patients with type 2 diabetes
inadequately controlled on basal insulin
with up to two oral glucose-lowering
agents.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Design
The LixiLan-L trial was an open-label,
randomized,parallel-group,multinational,
multicenter phase III clinical trial that was
initiated on 27 January 2014 and ended on
9 July 2015. The trial was designed and
monitored in accordance with Good Clin-
ical Practice, the International Conference
on Harmonization, and the Declaration of
Helsinki. Institutional review boards or
ethics committees at each study site ap-
proved the protocol. Each patient gave
written informed consent.
Supplementary Figure 1 summarizes
the trial design. Patients aged $18 years
with type 2 diabetes diagnosed at least
1 year before screening were eligible
to enroll. Patients had to have been
treated with a basal insulin for at least
6 months before screening, with a stable
regimen for at least 3 months. The total
daily basal insulin dose was required to
have been stable (6 20%) between
15 and 40 units/day for at least 2 months
before the screening visit. The dose(s) of
any oral glucose-lowering therapies
must have been stable during the
3 months before the screening visit.
The permitted OADs at screening were
metformin ($1,500 mg/day or maximal
tolerated dose), a sulfonylurea, glinide,
sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhi-
bitor, or dipeptidyl peptide 4 inhibitor.
The required FPG was #180 mg/dL
(#10 mmol/L) for patients receiving
basal insulin in combination with two
OADs or one OAD other than metfor-
min, and #200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)
for patients on basal insulin with or
without metformin.
Major exclusion criteria included the
following: use of an oral or injectable
glucose-lowering agent other than those
stated above; history of hypoglycemia
unawareness or metabolic acidosis, in-
cluding diabetic ketoacidosis within
1 year before screening; patients who
previously discontinued GLP-1 RAs be-
cause of poor safety, tolerability, or lack
of efficacy; and previous use of nonbasal
insulin (e.g., prandial or premixed insulin)
in the year before screening, with the ex-
ception of treatment with nonbasal insu-
lin for #10 days because of intercurrent
illness. Also exclusionary were amylase
and/or lipase levels .3 times the upper
limit of the normal laboratory range or
calcitonin $20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L).
Eligible patients entered a 6-week
run-in phase during which any OAD
other than metformin was stopped, pa-
tients were switched to iGlar (if they had
previously been receiving another basal
insulin), and the daily dose of iGlar was
titrated and/or stabilized for all pa-
tients. At the end of the run-in phase,
patients who had an HbA1c level of
7–10% (53–86 mmol/mol), a mean fast-
ing self-measured plasma glucose
(SMPG) of #140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L),
iGlar daily dose of 20–50 units
(inclusive), calcitonin of #20 pg/mL
(5.9 pmol/L), and amylase and/or lipase
levels ,3 times the upper limit of normal
were randomized in a 1:1 ratio stratified
by HbA1c value (,8%, $8% [,64,
$64 mmol/mol]) at week –1 and metfor-
min use at screening (yes/no) to receive
once-daily open-label treatment with
iGlarLixi or iGlar for 30 weeks. An interac-
tive voice/web response system gener-
ated the patient randomization list and
allocated treatment centrally based on a
randomization scheme provided by the
study statistician.
Interventions
iGlarLixi was self-administered once
daily within 60 min before breakfast us-
ing one of two SoloStar (Sanofi, Paris,
France) pen injectors, according to the
insulin dose required. Pen A, with a ratio
of 2 units Glar:1 mg Lixi, delivered doses
from 10 to 40 units, corresponding to
delivered doses of iGlar/Lixi from
10 units:5 mg up to 40 units:20 mg. Pen
B, with a ratio of 3 units iGlar:1 mg Lixi,
delivered doses from 30 to 60 units, cor-
responding to doses of iGlar/Lixi of
30 units/10 mg up to 60 units/20 mg.
The starting dose of iGlarLixi was deter-
mined from the last iGlar dose received
before randomization, at the end of the
run-in period, as follows: if, on the day

 before randomization, the dose of iGlar
was ,30 units, the starting dose of
iGlarLixi was 20 units:10 mg (given with
pen A); however, if the dose was
$30 units, the starting dose of iGlarLixi
was 30 units:10 mg (given with pen B).
The starting dose was kept stable for
2 weeks, with subsequent titration
once a week to reach and maintain a
target fasting SMPG of 80–100 mg/dL
(4.4–5.6 mmol/L) while avoiding hypogly-
cemia. Titration of iGlarLixi was based on
the required dose of iGlar according to
the following algorithm: +2 units (if FPG
was .100 and #140 mg/dL [.5.6
and #7.8 mmol/L]) or +4 units (if FPG
was .140 mg/dL [.7.8 mmol/L]). Dur-
ing the titration period, iGlarLixi was ad-
ministered with pen A or pen B according
to the required iGlarLixi daily dose. For a
given dose of between 30 and 40 units,
the pen that provided a higher dose of Lixi
(i.e., pen A with a ratio of 2 units iGlar:
1 mg Lixi) was used as long as it was well
tolerated.
iGlar was supplied in a prefilled dis-
posable Lantus SoloStar (Sanofi U.S.
LLC, Bridgewater, NJ) pen injector
(100 units/mL). In the current study, the
maximum iGlar once-daily dose was
capped at 60 units. The iGlar injection
time was at the discretion of patients
and investigators but remained at about
the same time each day throughout treat-
ment. The initial daily dose of iGlar was
the same dose as before randomization,
andthe titrationregimen wasthe same as
with iGlarLixi, capped also at 60 units.
Rescue medication in the form of a
short/rapid-acting insulin (e.g., insulin
glulisine) at the main meal was permitted
if the study drug (and metformin, if taken)
was insufficient to maintain glycemic con-
trol below predefined thresholds. The cri-
teria for the use of rescue medication
were as follows: if all fasting SMPG values
on 3 consecutive days exceeded the spe-
cific limit, the patient contacted the in-
vestigator, and a central laboratory FPG
measurement (and HbA1c measurement
after week 12) was performed.
The threshold values were defined as
follows:
c from week 8 to week 12 (excluding
the week 12 value): FPG .240 mg/dL
(13.3 mmol/L),
c from week 12 to week 30 (including
the week 30 value): FPG .200 mg/dL
(11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c .8%.
If the FPG or HbA1c values were above
the predefined thresholds, the investi-
gator had to ensure that no reasonable
explanation existed for insufficient glu-
cose control. If no reasons could be
found, if appropriate actions failed, or
if a dose of .60 units was necessary to
decrease FPG and/or HbA1c below the
threshold values defined for rescue
therapy, a short/rapid-acting insulin (in-
sulin glulisine) was introduced as rescue
therapy along with iGlarLixi or iGlar and
metformin (if taken). This was started
as a single daily administration at the
main meal of the day (except breakfast
in the iGlarLixi group). No other oral or
injectable antidiabetic treatment was
permitted as rescue medication in ei-
ther treatment group.
All assessments originally planned for
the end of treatment visit (visit 21) were
performed before rescue therapy was
initiated, including pharmacokinetic
and antibody assessments. After these
assessments were completed and res-
cue therapy had been initiated, the pa-
tient remained in the study according to
the planned schedule and continued
with study treatment (including metfor-
min, if applicable). The standardized
meal for the meal test consisted of one
Boost Plus drink and one Boost High Pro-
tein drink (Nestl´
e, Vevey, Switzerland) at
U.S. investigational sites, and two En-
sure Plus drinks (Abbot, Lake Bluff, IL)
at all other investigational sites.
Efficacy End Points
The primary efficacy end point was the
change in HbA1c from baseline to week
30. The percentage of patients reaching
target HbA1c ,7.0% (53 mmol/mol)
and #6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at week
30 and the change in 2-h PPG during
the standardized liquid meal test were
secondary end points. Other secondary
end points were tested in the following
prioritized order: change in 2-h PG excur-
sion during a standardized liquid meal
test, change in body weight, change in
average 7-point SMPG profile, percent-
age of patients reaching HbA1c ,7%
(53 mmol/mol) with no body weight gain
at week 30, percentage of patients reach-
ing HbA1c ,7% (53 mmol/mol) with no
body weight gain at week 30 and no docu-
mented symptomatic hypoglycemia dur-
ing treatment, iGlar daily dose, and FPG.
Additional secondary end points included
the percentage of patients reaching
HbA1c ,7% (53 mmol/mol) at week 30
with no documented symptomatic hypo-
glycemia (PG #70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L])
duringthe30-weekrandomizedtreatment
period and the percentage of patients re-
quiring rescue therapy during the 30-week
randomized treatment period.
Safety End Points
Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was
defined as requiring another person’s as-
sistance to actively administer carbohy-
drate, glucagon, or other resuscitative
actions. Documented symptomatic hypo-
glycemia was defined as typical symptoms
ofhypoglycemiaaccompaniedbyan SMPG
value of #70 mg/dL (#3.9 mmol/L).
Safety end points of special interest
included symptomatic hypoglycemia
and gastrointestinal AEs. Allergic reac-
tions, major cardiovascular events, and
pancreatic events were adjudicated by
specific independent committees, safety
laboratory values, vital signs and phys-
ical examination, electrocardiogram
(ECG), and anti-Lixi antibodies and/or
anti-insulin antibodies.
Laboratory safety variables analyzed in-
cluded hematology, clinical chemistry, lipid
parameters, serum amylase, lipase, and cal-
citonin.Clinicalsafetywasassessedbyphys-
ical examination, systolicand diastolicblood
pressure, heart rate, and ECG variables.
Committees and Blinding
The Data Monitoring Committee re-
viewed and analyzed safety data pro-
vided by an independent statistical
group throughout the study. The Allergic
Reaction Assessment Committee (ARAC)
reviewed and adjudicated allergic reac-
tions or allergy-like reactions after ran-
domization. The Cardiovascular Events
Adjudication Committee (CAC) reviewed
and adjudicated major cardiovascular
events after randomization. The Pancre-
atic Safety Assessment Committee (PSAC)
reviewed and adjudicated selected pan-
creaticevents(includingpancreatitis, pan-
creatic neoplasms, and abnormal levels of
amylase or lipase) after randomization.
The study was an open-label design.
Therefore, data that could identify
treatment were masked for data review
and event adjudication, and thus the
ARAC, CAC, and PSAC reviewed and ad-
judicated blinded data.
Statistical Methods
Enrolling 350 patients per group was re-
quired to detect a 0.4%, considered
1974

 clinically meaningful, mean difference in
change in HbA1c from baseline to week
30 between the iGlarLixi and the iGlar
groups with at least 95% power (two-
sided t test; 5% significance level; com-
mon SD of 1.1%).
Efficacy analyses were evaluated
using a modified intent-to-treat (mITT)
population of all randomized patients
who had a baseline assessment and at
least one postbaseline assessment of
any primary or secondary efficacy vari-
ables, irrespective of compliance with
the protocol and procedures. Analyses
of the primary efficacy end point (change
from baseline to week 30 in HbA1c) were
performed using the mITT population,
using HbA1c values obtained from the
scheduled visits during the study, includ-
ing those obtained after study drug dis-
continuation or rescue medication use.
The statistical test was two-sided at the
a level of 0.05. The primary efficacy end
point was analyzed using a mixed-effect
model with repeated measures (MMRM)
that included the treatment groups,
randomization strata, visit, treatment-
by-visit interaction, and country as
fixed-effect factors, and the baseline
HbA1c-by-visit interaction as covariates.
The adjusted mean change in HbA1c
from baseline to week 30 for each treat-
ment group was estimated, as was the
between-group difference and the
95% CI for the adjusted mean. This same
MMRM method or ANCOVA was applied
on continuous secondary efficacy end
points, and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel
method stratified by randomization strata
was applied on categorical secondary effi-
cacy end points. Secondary efficacy vari-
ables were tested in a prioritized order, and
testing was stopped when an end point was
found not to be statistically significant.
The safety population was defined as
all randomized patients who received
at least one dose of open-label iGlarLixi,
or iGlar, regardless of the amount of
treatment administered. Patients were
analyzed for safety according to the treat-
ment received rather than the group to
which they were randomized.
RESULTS
Patient Disposition and Baseline
Characteristics
A total of 736 patients were randomized
at 187 centers in 18 countries, with
367 patients assigned to the iGlarLixi
group and 369 to the iGlar group
(Supplementary Fig. 2). At screening,
64.4% of patients were receiving iGlar,
21.5% NPH, and 14.1% insulin detemir as
basal insulin. Demographics and baseline
characteristics were similar across the
two treatment groups (Table 1). Patients
were a median age of 60.0 years, were
primarily white (91.7%), were generally
overweight or obese (mean BMI
;31 kg/m2), had a mean duration of di-
abetes of ;12 years, and had a mean
duration of prior basal insulin treatment
of ;3 years. In the iGlarLixi group, 43% of
patients had previously received metfor-
min plus another oral drug (discontinued
at run-in start), and 46% had received
only metformin. These proportions were
similar in the iGlar group (38% and 52%,
respectively).
Primary Efficacy End Point
During the run-in period of basal insulin
(glargine) titration and stabilization, the
mean HbA1c level decreased overall
from 8.5% (69 mmol/mol) at screening to
8.1% (65 mmol/mol) at baseline by the
time of randomization. Statistical superior-
ityofiGlarLixioveriGlarwasdemonstrated
for the change in HbA1c from baseline to
week 30 (least-squares mean difference
vs. iGlar –0.5%; 95% CI –0.6, –0.4; P ,
0.0001). Mean HbA1c levels were reduced
more with iGlarLixi than with iGlar (–1.1%
vs. –0.6%, respectively), achieving after
30 weeks of treatment final HbA1c levels
of 6.9% (52 mmol/mol) for iGlarLixi and
7.5% (58 mmol/mol) for iGlar (Fig. 1A
and Table 2).
Secondary Efficacy End Points
A significantly greater proportion of
patients treated with iGlarLixi had
reached the HbA1c targets of ,7.0%
(53 mmol/mol) (55% vs. 30%) and
#6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (34% vs. 14%)
compared with iGlar (P , 0.0001 in
each case) at week 30 (Fig. 1B and Table
2). The improvement in HbA1c was

 accompanied by a significant difference
of 1.4 kg in body weight change from
baseline to week 30 favoring iGlarLixi
compared with iGlar (P , 0.0001) (Fig.
1C and Table 2). Notably, a post hoc eval-
uation of the percentage of patients
with no weight gain at week 30 showed
that 54% of patients in the iGlarLixi
group had no weight gain during the
treatment period, whereas 62% of pa-
tients in the iGlar group gained weight.
Although the mean change in FPG
was comparable for the two groups
from baseline to week 30 (Table 2 and
Supplementary Table 1), reflecting con-
sistent titration of the basal insulin
components, iGlarLixi compared with
iGlar significantly improved postprandial
glycemic control after a standardized liq-
uid breakfast meal, as demonstrated by
mean change in 2-h glucose excursion
from baseline to week 30 (–62 mg/dL

 difference). Similarly, patients treated
with iGlarLixi showed a significantly
greater decrease in the average 7-point
SMPG profiles compared with pa-
tients treated with iGlar (–16 mg/dL
[–0.90 mmol/L] difference; P , 0.0001).
After 30 weeks, values on the 7-point
SMPGprofileswere loweratalltimepoints
in the iGlarLixi group compared with iGlar,
with the exception of similar fasting pre-
breakfast values (Fig. 1D, Table 2, and
Supplementary Table 1). These results are
consistent with the comparable FPG levels
observed between treatment groups.
A significantly higher percentage
of patients reached the predefined
composite end point of HbA1c ,7.0%
(53 mmol/mol) with no body weight
gain at week 30 in the iGlarLixi group
(34%) compared with iGlar (13%; P ,
0.0001) (Fig. 1E and Table 2) and
reached the composite end point of
HbA1c ,7.0% (53 mmol/mol) at week
30 with no documented symptomatic
hypoglycemia during the treatment pe-
riod with iGlarLixi (32%) than with iGlar
(19%) (Table 2). In addition, a greater
proportion reached HbA1c ,7.0%
(53 mmol/mol) with no body weight
gain at week 30 and with no docu-
mented symptomatic hypoglycemia
during the treatment period with
iGlarLixi (20%) than with iGlar (9%).
Insulin dose titration was initiated in
the run-in period. To not exceed the
highest recommended starting dose of
10 mg for Lixi, iGlarLixi treatment was
initiated at a dose of 20 units with pen
A or 30 units with pen B, depending on
the patient’s dose at the end of the
run-in period. Therefore, although the
insulin doseinthe iGlarLixi groupdropped
at randomization, insulin doses were
identical between the iGlarLixi and the
iGlar treatment groups for most of the
second half of the study and at week 30,
reflecting basal insulin titration to similar
final FPG levels. The mean final insulin
dose was ;47 units, corresponding to a
mean dose adjusted by body weight of
0.54 units/kg in both groups. The propor-
tions of patients who required final insu-
lin dose of 60 units were 27.1% in the
iGlarLixi group and 30.7% in the iGlar
group. The mean corresponding final Lixi
dose was 17 mg in the iGlarLixi group.
Rescue therapy with prandial insulin was
required at the main meal in 10 patients
(2.7%) in the iGlarLixi group and in
22 (6.0%) in the iGlar group.

 Safety Profile
Hypoglycemia
Comparable proportions of patients in
the iGlarLixi (40.0%) and iGlar groups
(42.5%) reported documented symp-
tomatic hypoglycemia (PG #70 mg/dL
[#3.9 mmol/L]). The corresponding
number of events per patient-year was
lower in the iGlarLixi group than in the
iGlar group (3.03 vs. 4.22). The percent-
age of patients with at least one severe
symptomatic hypoglycemic event was
low: four patients (1.1%) in the iGlarLixi
group experienced five events, and one
patient (0.3%) in the iGlar group experi-
enced one event. In most of these cases,
there were contributing circumstances
that likely explained the event develop-
ment, such as excessive exercise and di-
minished oral intake before the events.
Overall Safety
Both treatments were well tolerated.
The safety profile of iGlarLixi generally
reflected the established safety profiles
of its components (Table 3). The most
frequently reported AE was nausea in
the iGlarLixi group and nasopharyngitis
in the iGlar group. Gastrointestinal
disorders were more common with
iGlarLixi than with iGlar (Table 3), were
generally mild to moderate, and led to
treatment discontinuation in very few
patients (1.1%). Few potential allergic
events were sent to ARAC for adjudica-
tion, and none was adjudicated as an
allergic reaction in the iGlarLixi group.
Major cardiovascular AEs occurred in
low and similar percentages of patients
in both groups. There were no pancrea-
titis AE, and no pancreatic neoplasms
were reported.
A similar proportion of serious AEs
were reported with iGlarLixi and iGlar
(Table 3). Three patients experienced
at least one severe AE leading to death:
one from the iGlarLixi group (pneumo-
nia) and two from the iGlar group (gall-
bladder cancer and cardiopulmonary
failure). A higher proportion of patients
withdrew from treatment because of
AEs in the iGlarLixi group than in the
iGlar group. This difference was mainly
because of gastrointestinal AEs (1.1%).
Generally, there was no substantial
difference in the safety profiles of (anti-
insulin and anti-Lixi) antibody-positive
and antibody-negative populations. No
clinically significant safety concerns were
identified from a review of clinical labora-
tory parameters (including lipase and am-
ylase), vital signs, physical examination, or
ECGs.
Increased calcitonin, categorized as
AEs, was confirmed in two patients in
the iGlar group and in no patients in the
iGlarLixi group. None of the events were
seriousorledtotreatmentdiscontinuation.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated that iGlarLixi, a
novel, titratable, fixed-ratio combina-
tion of iGlar and Lixi was more effective
in achieving meaningful improvements
in glycemic control than iGlar alone,
reaching a final mean HbA1c of 6.9%
(52 mmol/mol) for iGlarLixi, with benefi-
cial effects on body weight and without
increasing hypoglycemia risk, in a chal-
lenging population of patients with
poorly controlled, basal-insulin treated,
long-standing type 2 diabetes. Patients
included in the study were overweight
or obese, with a long duration of disease
(mean diabetes duration of ;12 years)
and a mean HbA1c at screening of 8.5%
despite treatment for several years with
basal insulin plus OADs. The improve-
ment with iGlar alone to an HbA1c of
7.5% was consistent with several trials
when the basal insulin is titrated ro-
bustly but not enough to reach HbA1c
targets (13) because further therapy is
needed to address postprandial hyper-
glycemia. iGlarLixi was indeed successful
in further improving HbA1c to a meaning-
ful 6.9% by addressing simultaneously
fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia
in a single injection formulation.
The improvement in HbA1c was also
supported by the significantly higher
proportion of patients treated with
iGlarLixi in this study who reached the
HbA1c targets of ,7.0% (53 mmol/mol)
(55% vs. 30%) and ,6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
(34% vs. 14%) compared with iGlar (P ,
0.0001 for both).
As observed with previous studies
(14,15), the Lixi component of iGlarLixi
appears to have mitigated the weight
gain generally observed with basal insu-
lin in this population, with a significant
weight difference of 1.4 kg between the
iGlarLixi and iGlar arms (P , 0.0001).
The composite end points further con-
firm that the glycemic control achieved
with iGlarLixi did not come at the cost of
increased weight, because 34% of pa-
tients reached HbA1c ,7% (53 mmol/mol)
with no weight gain for iGlarLixi compared
with 13% for iGlar. Despite the meaningful
improvements in glycemic control, the
incidence of documented symptomatic
hypoglycemia was similar in the iGlarLixi
and iGlar treatment groups.
As expected, nausea and vomiting AEs
were reported more frequently in the
iGlarLixi group than in the iGlar group;
however, nausea and vomiting inci-
dences were much lower than those ob-
served when Lixi is used as a standalone
treatment, generally in the 25–30%
range (7,9,12). Importantly, very few
patients discontinued iGlarLixi because
of nausea (1.1%) and none for vomiting.
This is most likely because of the gradual

LixiLan-L: iGlarLixi in T2D on Basal Insulin
Diabetes Care Volume 39, November 2016
 increase of the Lixi dose that follows in
parallel to the iGlar titration guided by
FPGs and tolerance, which clearly miti-
gates the gastrointestinal AEs. This is a
very relevant result given that gastroin-
testinal AEs were among the main rea-
sons for discontinuation of GLP-1 RAs
in a real-world patient survey (16).
Although an indirect comparison,
these results compare favorably with
those of the GetGoal Duo-2 trial (12),
in which Lixi given sequentially as an
add-on to basal insulin achieved HbA1c
levels of 7.2% in a similar population,
and suggest that iGlar plus Lixi given si-
multaneously as iGlarLixi may be highly
effective in a population requiring fur-
ther treatment intensification despite
prior basal insulin treatment.
Comparative benefits of combination
of basal insulin with GLP-1 RA as a single
injection versus iGlar titration in basal
insulin–treated patients with type 2 di-
abetes have also been reported in the
Dual Action of Liraglutide and Insulin
Degludec (DUAL) V trial, which examined
the efficacy of IDegLira, a single injection
combination of insulin degludec and the
GLP-1 RA liraglutide (17). In both LixiLan-L
and DUAL V, greater HbA1c reductions
and a greater proportion of patients
reaching glycemic targets were achieved
with the combination of basal insulin with
GLP-1 RA (iGlarLixi and IDegLira, respec-
tively) compared with titration of iGlar.
Consistent across both studies, the deliv-
eryofbasalinsulinwithGLP-1RAasagrad-
ually titratable coformulation appears to
confer advantages in weight reduction
compared with iGlar titration and seems
to be associated with less gastrointestinal
intolerability than that typically seen with
stepped titration of the GLP-1 RA.
One limitation of the study was its open-
label design, which was necessary to
account for differences in therapy adminis-
tration between the groups. An additional
limitation is the 30-week study duration.
Longer trials will be needed to assess dura-
bility of the glucose-lowering effects.
In conclusion, in overweight patients
with long-standing type 2 diabetes
uncontrolled despite several years on
basal insulin and up to two OADs, iGlarLixi
achieved superior improvements in
glycemic control, with beneficial effects
on body weight, no additional risk of hypo-
glycemia compared with iGlar, and a low
rate of gastrointestinal AEs compared
with data from prior studies of lixisenatide.
These findings further support the ap-
proachofusingatitratable,fixed-ratiocom-
bination of basal insulin and a GLP-1 RA
therapy in the same formulation to simplify
and more effectively intensify basal insulin
treatment in this challenging patient popu-
lation with long-standing type 2 diabetes.
