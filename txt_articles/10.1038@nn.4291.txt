During exploration, the activity of place1 and grid cells2 represents 
self-location. Together these cells have been hypothesized to support 
spatial memory1,3 and navigation3,4. Hippocampal replay5,6—the 
reactivation of place cell sequences during immobility and sleep—has 
been proposed as a mechanism for consolidation5 and route plan-
ning7, yet the involvement of grid cells remains unknown. Potentially, 
spatially coherent place and grid cell activity may emerge during 
replay as the hippocampus broadcasts memory traces to the cortex8. 
To study the involvement of grid cells in replay we recorded con-
currently from rodent medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) layers V and 
VI (V/VI) and hippocampus (CA1) during track-running and 
 
subsequent rest. We report robust coherence between place and grid 
cell spatial representations during hippocampal replay.
We recorded a total of 43 grid cells across 11 sessions from 6 rats con-
currently with 34–72 place cells in each session, for a total of 592 place 
cells (Fig. 1a–d, Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary 
Table 1). During subsequent rest, we identified putative replay events 
on the basis of place cell activity (Fig. 1e and Online Methods). We 
used a Bayesian decoding algorithm9 and a trajectory-fitting procedure 
 
to reconstruct position and score the replay9 (Supplementary Fig. 3). 
For further analyses, we used robust replay events exhibiting clear, 
straight trajectories (each P < 0.2 versus their own shuffle). On aver-
age, grid cell activity was higher during replay events than during 
non-replay periods10 (2.19 Hz (s.d. = 1.74) versus 1.33 Hz (s.d. = 1.61), 
 
t(43) = 3.24, P = 0.00023), with peak grid cell activity lagging that of 
place cells by 10 ms (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 4). To inves-
tigate grid–place cell spatial coherence, we assessed the similarity 
of the grid and place cell representations during replay events in 
which both were active. Specifically, we superimposed the trajectory 
derived from a hippocampal replay event onto the decoded represen-
tation from concurrently recorded grid cell spikes (Supplementary 
Fig. 5). The position represented by grid cells during replay events 
was similar to that represented by the place cell trajectories (Fig. 2a 
and Supplementary Fig. 6), exceeding the coherence obtained by 
pairing a grid cell event with a random place cell event from the 
same session (P < 0.0001, area under the curve (AUC) test; Online

Hippocampal replay has been hypothesized to underlie memory 
consolidation and navigational planning, yet the involvement 
of grid cells in replay is unknown. During replay we found 
grid cells to be spatially coherent with place cells, encoding 
locations 11 ms delayed relative to the hippocampus, with 
directionally modulated grid cells and forward replay exhibiting 
the greatest coherence with the CA1 area of the hippocampus. 
This suggests grid cells are engaged during the consolidation of 
spatial memories to the neocortex.

shuffled distributions generated by permuting grid cell ratemaps 
 
(P < 0.0001 AUC) and spike times (P < 0.001 AUC) corroborated 
this finding (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Grid–place cell coher-
ence also exceeded chance levels when analysis was limited to just the 
strongest (P < 0.025 versus their own shuffle) place cell replay events 
(P < 0.0001 AUC, Supplementary Fig. 9) and did not exceed chance 
levels for the least robust (P > 0.5) place cell events (P = 0.17 AUC, 
Supplementary Fig. 10).
To confirm these results, we constructed an ‘event ratemap’ for each 
grid cell using the spikes emitted during replay events and the position 
decoded from concurrent place cell activity (see Online Methods). 
Event ratemaps and ratemaps generated from track running were 
similar (mean Pearson correlation r= 0.10, s.e.m. = 0.033, Fig. 2c,d) 
and exceeded the correlations obtained from two shuffling procedures 
(ratemap shuffle W(78) = 763, P = 0.0079; grid spike times shuffle, 
W(78) = 703, P = 0.01). In summary, we employed two distinct meth-
ods to assess spatial coherence between grid and place cells during 
replay events, confirming that these cell types are closely coordinated 
during hippocampal replay.
Forward replay—i.e., events that preserve place field sequences 
experienced during wakefulness—has been linked to consolidation 
and planning5,7 and reverse replay to reward learning6. Consequently, 
we assessed coordination between grid and place cells during for-
ward and reverse replay events separately. Grid cells were more 
likely to be active during forward than reverse events (forward, 639 
of 1,127 (57%); reverse, 315 of 699 (45%); χ2 = 23.41, P < 0.0001) 
and grid–place cell spatial coherence was greater for forward than 
reverse replay (P = 0.0006 AUC, Fig. 3a). This difference did not result 
from the unequal number of forward and reverse events: equating the 
number of events by down-sampling did not eliminate the difference

(P < 0.0001). Forward and reverse events both exhibited grid–place 
cell coherence that significantly exceeded chance levels (forward, 
 
P < 0.0001 AUC; reverse, P = 0.0093 AUC; Fig. 3a).
Next, we examined the temporal relationship between grid and 
place cell spatial coherence during replay events. If grid cell participa-
tion in replay results from a consolidation mechanism5, the location 
encoded by grid cells might lag the place cell trajectory, as in the 10-ms 
lag seen in peak rates between the two regions (Fig. 1f). We investi-
gated grid–place cell coherence for time lags between ±60 ms, finding 
a significant effect of time for forward but not reverse events (for-
ward, F(24,4320) = 9.26, P < 0.0001; reverse, F(24,1464) = 0.37, P = 0.75). 
 
Moreover, for forward events we found the highest grid–place cell 
coherence when grid cell spike times were shifted back by an average 
of 11 ms relative to place cells (Fig. 3b). Analysis of the distribution 
of best time shifts across forward events revealed a unimodal distribu-
tion peaking at 8 ms (Fig. 3c).
Finally, we investigated the relationship between the strength of 
replay coherence for individual grid cells (indexed by their mean 
spatial coherence) and the extent of their modulation by head direc-
tion and hexagonal symmetry in the open field (gridness11). We 
found that directional modulation correlated with replay coher-
ence (Spearman’s r = 0.61, P = 0.000093, Fig. 3d) such that direc-
tional grid cells (Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence > 0.15)12 
exhibited higher coherence with place cells than nondirectional 
grid cells (0.16 (s.d. = 0.082) versus 0.082 (s.d. = 0.030), t(35) = 3.57, 
 
P = 0.0011, P < 0.0001 AUC test). Yet both cell types showed sig-
nificant grid–place cell coherence (directional cells: P < 0.0001 AUC, 
nondirectional cells: P < 0.0001 AUC, Supplementary Fig. 11), as 
well as a lag relative to the CA1 encoded location (directional cells, 
F(24,1056) = 4.150, P < 0.0001; nondirectional cells, F(24,3312) = 3.060, 
P < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 12). Grid–place cell coherence was 
not modulated by hexagonal symmetry (Spearman’s r = 0.14, P = 0.41, 
 
Supplementary Fig. 13).
To conclude, we report that hippocampal place cells and MEC V/VI 
grid cells (Supplementary Fig. 14) are closely coordinated during 
replay, suggesting that replay may be a general property of networks 
encoding self-location. Moreover, grid cells are more active during 
forward replay events during which they exhibit greater spatial coher-
ence with place cells. During these events the position encoded by 
MEC V/VI lags behind that in CA1, suggesting that replay sequences 
originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the MEC. As the 
 
coordination occurs in the absence of sensory cues, it plausibly orig-
inates from the internal dynamics of the hippocampal network13. 
Together this supports the view that replay during rest is the mecha-
nism by which memories are consolidated to the neocortex8, MEC 
V/VI being the primary cortical output target of the hippocampus. 
 
It remains to be seen whether grid cells in superficial MEC are engaged 
during on-track replay or navigational planning4.

Animals and surgery. Six male Lister Hooded rats were used in this study. All 
procedures were approved by the UK Home Office, subject to the restrictions 
and provisions contained in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. 
 
All rats (330–400 g at implantation) received two microdrives, each carrying 
eight tetrodes of twisted 17 µm HM-L coated platinum iridium wire (90% and 
10%, respectively; California Fine Wire), targeted to the right CA1 (ML: 2.2 
mm, AP: 3.8 mm posterior to bregma) and left medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) 
 
(ML = 4.5 mm, AP = 0.3–0.7 anterior to the transverse sinus, angled between 
8–10°). Wires were platinum plated to reduce impedance to 200–300 k at 1 kHz. 
After rats had recovered from surgery they were maintained at 90% of free- 
feeding weight with ad libitum access to water and were housed individually on 
a 12-h light-dark cycle.
Recording. Screening was performed post-surgically after a 1-week recovery 
period. An Axona recording system (Axona Ltd.) was used to acquire the single-
units and positional data (for details of the recording system and basic recording 
protocol see Barry et al.14). The position and head direction of the animals was 
inferred using an overhead video camera to record the location of two light-emitting 
 
diodes (LED) mounted on the animals’ head-stages (50 Hz). Tetrodes were gradu-
ally advanced in 62.5 µm steps across days until place cells (CA1) or grid cells 
(MEC) were found.
experimental apparatus and protocol. The experiment was run during the ani-
mals’ light period, to facilitate rest during the rest session. During track running 
sessions animals shuttled back and forward on a Z-shaped track comprised of 
10 cm wide runways covered with black paint, raised 75 cm off the ground. The 
two parallel sections of the Z (190 cm each) were connected by a diagonal section 
 
(220 cm). The entire track was surrounded by plain black curtains. Animals 
 
were pretrained to run on the track, taking between 3 and 6 d before they would 
shuttle fluently from one end to the other. At the start of each session, rats were 
placed at one end of the Z-track. The same end was used as a starting location 
for every day of the experiment and for every rat. The ends and corners of the 
track were baited with sweetened rice to encourage running from one end to the 
other. In each session rats completed 20 full laps (30–45 min).
Following the track session, rats were placed in the rest enclosure for an hour 
and a half. The rest enclosure consisted of a cylindrically shaped environment 
(18 cm diameter, 61 cm high) with a towel placed at the bottom and was located 
outside of the curtains that surrounded the Z-track. Animals were not able to 
see the surrounding room while in the rest enclosure. Prior to recording, rats 
had been familiarized with the rest environment for at least 7 d.
Following the rest session, rats completed a 20 min foraging trial in a familiar 
open field environment. Recordings made during this period provided the basis 
on which spatially modulated cells were functionally classified.
As we did not use experimental groups, randomization and experimenter 
blinding were not applicable.
Data inclusion/exclusion. Once animals were experienced and ran well on the 
track (following 3–6 d of training) we considered that any session with at least 
30 place cells and 1 grid cell met our minimum requirements and hence was 
eligible for analysis. The number of sessions that fulfilled these criteria varied 
between animals (1–3). Importantly, if multiple sessions were included from the 
same animal, we ensured the different sessions did not contain the same grid 
cells (based on history of electrode movement, waveforms and spatial ratemaps 
in the open field screening sessions).
The criteria for including place and grid cells are described below in the 
‘Functional classification’ and ‘Data analysis’ sections, as are the criteria for 
including replay events (‘Data analysis’ section). All data that met these criteria 
were included in all of the analyses.
Functional classification. We classified spatially modulated MEC cells as grid 
cells using a shuffling procedure similar to that applied elsewhere15,16. Specifically, 
the hexagonal regularity of each cell was assessed using two methods, the ‘stand-
ard’ gridness measure17 and ‘modified’ gridness measure16. For each method 
the values calculated for each cell were compared with a null distribution of 
 
100 values obtained by calculating the gridness values of data in which the cell’s 
spike train had been randomly permuted relative to the position of the animal 
by at least 30 s. A cell was considered to be a grid cell and admitted to the main 
analysis if its standard or modified gridness value exceeded the 97.5th percentile 
of the matching null distribution; 43 grid cells from 6 rats were identified.
Following Doeller et al.12, we assessed the extent of directional modulation 
exhibited by each grid cell by calculating the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence 
between the cell’s polar rate map and a uniform circular distribution with 
 
equal mean:

where τ1(i) is the value in the ith bin of a polar rate map normalized to have area 
1 (as a probability distribution) and τ2(i) is the ith bin of a uniform probability 
distribution with the same number of bins as τ1. Grid cells with KL divergence 
greater than 0.15 were considered to be directional12 (13 of 43 cells).
Data analysis. We generated ratemaps for runs on the Z-track after first 
excluding areas in which the animals regularly performed non-perambulatory 
behaviors (for example, eating or grooming), which generally took place in the 
final 10 cm at either end of the track and 5 cm around each of the two cor-
ners. Periods when the animals’ running speed was less than 3 cm/s were also 
excluded. Each animal’s path was linearized and dwell time and spikes binned 
into 2 cm bins, then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 5 bins). We calculated 
the firing rate for each bin by dividing the spike number by dwell time. We gener-
ated separate ratemaps for runs in the outbound and inbound directions.
We identified replay events from the rest session on the basis of the activity 
of hippocampal place cells using a similar method to Pfeiffer and Foster7 and 
Ólafsdóttir et al.9 Hippocampal cells were classified as place cells if their firing 
field’s peak firing rate exceeded 1 Hz and was at least 20 cm long. Interneurons, 
identified by narrow waveforms and high firing rates, were excluded from all 
analyses. To identify replay events, multi-unit (MU) activity from hippocam-
pal place cells only were binned into 1 ms temporal bins and smoothed with 
a Gaussian kernel (σ = 5 ms). We identified periods when the MU activity 
exceeded the mean rate by 3 s.d. as putative replay events and determined the 
start and end points of each putative replay event as the time when the MU 
activity fell back to the mean. Events less than 40 ms long or which included 
activity from less than 15% of the recorded place cell ensemble were rejected 
(4,382 events included in total).
To analyze modulation of grid cell activity by replay events we first estimated 
the firing rate of each cell inside (‘event rate’) and outside (‘baseline rate’) events. 
Differences in event and baseline rates were then assessed using a paired t-test. 
Second, to assess the temporal synchrony between grid cell activity and replay 
events, we generated peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) for each event, cen-
tered on the temporal midpoint of the event (bin size = 10 ms). Specifically, 
for each event we counted the number of grid cell spikes emitted in a 2,000 ms 
window centered on the middle of the event. Spikes were then summed across all 
recorded events to generate one PSTH per session. Finally, PSTHs for all sessions 
were combined into a single grand PSTH, the peak of which was identified. The 
same procedure was repeated for place cells.
To analyze replay, place cell spikes from putative events were binned into 10 
ms temporal bins and a Bayesian framework9 was used to calculate the prob-
ability of the animal’s presence in each spatial bin given the observed spikes (the 
posterior probability matrix). This approach was validated using data from the 
track running session except that spikes were binned into 500 ms temporal bins 
and location was decoded from the posterior probability matrix using a simple 
maximum likelihood method. Within each temporal bin the animal’s location 
was decoded to the bin with the highest posterior probability and this was com-
pared with the known true location (mean decoding error 20 cm). Note that we 
generated two posterior probability matrices for each event, one for inbound 
runs and one for outbound runs.
To score the extent to which putative replay events represented a constant 
speed trajectory along the Z-track we applied a line-fitting algorithm9. Lines 
were defined with a gradient (V) and intercept (c), equivalent to the velocity 
and starting location of the trajectory. We defined the goodness of fit of a given 
line (R(V,c)) as the proportion of the probability distribution that lay within 
 
30 cm of it. Specifically where P is the probability matrix:

where t indexes the time bins of width T and d is set to 30 cm. We maximized 
(R(V,c) using an exhaustive search to test all combinations of V between 
 
−50 ms−1 and 50 ms−1 in 0.5 ms−1 increments (excluding slow trajectories with speeds 
>–2 ms−1 and <2 ms−1) and c between −15 m and 21 m in 0.01 m increments.
To assess putative replay events for significance we carried out a spatial shuffle 
of the place cell ratemaps. Specifically, each ratemap was shuffled by shifting it 
relative to the track by a random number of bins drawn from a flat distribution 
between 1 and the length of the track minus 1 bin. The ratemap for each cell 
was rotated independently and in each case trailing bins were wrapped around 
to ensure an equal number of bins were used for each shuffle. We repeated this 
process 100 times for each event and for each shuffle we calculated a goodness 
of fit measure (as described above). This enabled us to estimate the probability 
of obtaining a given event by chance. Robust events, with an individual P-value 
of less than 0.2, were accepted as replay events and submitted to further analyses 
(1,826 out of 4,382 putative events). Note that we generated two shuffling dis-
tributions for each event, one for inbound runs and one for outbound runs. An 
event was considered to be inbound run if the P-value for the inbound run was 
lower than that for outbound runs, and vice versa. Thus, only one event (either 
inbound or outbound) was submitted to further analyses. Finally, for all inbound 
events the grid cell ratemaps for inbound runs were used to assess grid–place cell 
coherence, and conversely for outbound events we used grid cell ratemaps.
To investigate spatial coherence between grid and place cells during replay 
events we applied the same Bayesian framework to the grid cell spikes. Hence, 
for each replay event we also calculated a posterior probability matrix based 
solely on the observed grid cell spikes. Rather than fitting straight-line trajec-
tories to the periodic grid cell posteriors, we compared the best-fit line from the 
concurrently recorded place cell posterior. Specifically, we fitted a line with the 
same intercept and slope as the concurrent place cell event and calculated the 
proportion of the probability distribution lying within 0.5x cm of the line, where 
x was equal to the average size of the grid cell firing fields recorded from that 
animal on the linear track. This value was used to index grid–place cell replay 
coherence. To estimate statistical significance of the observed coherence scores 
we used three different shuffling procedures.
In the first instance a shuffle distribution was generated by randomly pairing 
each grid cell posterior with 100 non-concurrent place cell events from the same 
animal and from the same session; only place cell events that were also accom-
panied by grid cell firing were used. We then reran the line fitting procedure 
to estimate grid–place cell replay coherence, as described above. To assess the 
statistical significance of the obtained distribution of coherence scores against 
the shuffle we bootstrapped the data distribution 10,000 times, computing the 
cumulative distribution and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC, i.e., 
the sum of the cumulative distribution) for each bootstrap. Difference scores 
between each of the 10,000 AUC scores obtained from the bootstrapped data 
and the shuffle distribution were computed and the 95% confidence interval 
estimated on the basis of on these difference scores (assuming a 2-sided test). 
A result was deemed statistically significant if the confidence interval did not 
contain 0.
Second, we applied a spatial shuffling procedure. This procedure was similar 
to the shuffling procedure used for place cell events. Specifically, each grid cell 
ratemap was shuffled by shifting it relative to the track by a random number 
between 10 and the length of the track minus 10 bins. The ratemap for each cell 
was rotated independently and trailing bins were wrapped around to ensure 
an equal number of bins were used for each shuffle. We repeated this process 
 
100 times for each event. For each shuffle, the grid–place cell replay coherence 
score was calculated using the slope and intercept parameters of the best-fit line 
of the accompanying place cell event (unshuffled). To assess statistical signifi-
cance we used an AUC test as described above.
Third, we applied a temporal shuffling procedure. Specifically, we shifted the 
spike times of grid cells active in replay events by a random amount between 
 
5 ms and the length of the event minus 5 ms. The relative timing of spikes from 
the same cell was maintained. Trailing spikes were wrapped around to the start 
of the event to ensure an equal number of spikes contributed to each shuffle. For 
each shuffled event, we generated its posterior probability matrix, compared it 
to the best-fit line from the concurrent place cell event (unshuffled) to the shuf-
fled posterior and computed a grid–place cell replay coherence score as detailed 
above. Statistical significance was again assessed using an AUC test.
Finally, we employed a second, distinct approach, to validate our observation 
of coherence between grid and place cells during replay. Namely, for each grid 
cell we constructed an event ratemap by using the timing of grid cell spikes dur-
ing replay events and the decoded location based on the line fit to the place cell 
posterior probability matrix. Spikes and dwell time were binned into 2 cm spatial 
bins and the resulting ratemap smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 5 bins). 
 
Each event ratemap was compared with the standard ratemap derived from nor-
mal track running using a Pearson correlation. As before, we established signifi-
cance independently against two null distributions. First, for the event ratemap 
the correlation between each event and standard ratemap was percentile ranked 
against correlations obtained between the same ratemaps but with the standard 
ratemap shifted incrementally to all possible lags relative to the event ratemap. 
Trailing bins were wrapped around to ensure a constant number of bins were 
used in each comparison. We used a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to determine 
if the ranks observed for the grid cells differed significantly from an expected 
median rank of 50%. A second null distribution was generated by shifting the 
timing of the grid cell spikes within each replay event by a random period drawn 
from a flat distribution covering 0 s to the length of the replay event. Spikes that 
exceed the duration of the event were wrapped back to the start but otherwise 
the relative timing of spikes within each event was unaffected. We repeated this 
procedure for each event and the event ratemap constructed as before and then 
compared it with the standard ratemap. This entire procedure was repeated 
100 times for each grid cell and in each case the correlation between the event 
ratemap and standard ratemap was percentile ranked against the correlations 
obtained from the shuffling procedure. Again we used a Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test to determine if the observed ranks exceed that expected by chance.
We identified forward and reverse replay events on the basis of the gradient 
of the line fit to the place cell posterior probability matrix. For outbound events, 
events that progressed down the track (for example, from the start of the track 
to the end) were categorized as forward events, while events depicting runs in 
the opposite direction were categorized as reverse events. The converse was true 
for inbound events. To assess whether grid cells were more likely to be active 
in forward rather than reverse events, we used a chi-square test to assess the 
proportion of all forward events accompanied by grid spikes (57%) against the 
proportion of all reverse events accompanied by grid spikes (45%). Moreover, 
we repeated the main AUC analysis, described earlier, for each event type to 
assess difference in grid–place cell coherence for forward and reverse events. 
Finally, as we recorded more forward events than reverse events (639 versus 
315), we down-sampled the coherence scores for the forward events 100 times 
to equal the number of reverse event coherence scores. For each iteration of the 
down-sampling procedure we computed the mean forward coherence score 
and compared it against that for the reverse events. If the mean for 95 of 100 
down-sampling iterations still exceeded that for the reverse events we deemed 
the obtained statistical difference between forward and reverse coherence scores 
not to be a confound of varying sample sizes.
To analyze the temporal synchrony between grid and place cell representations 
during replay events, we applied a time shift to grid cell spikes (starting at −60 ms 
then advancing in 5 ms steps to +60 ms). For each time shift we calculated the mean 
coherence between grid and place cells using the line fitting procedure. To assess 
whether the mean coherence varied as a function of time shift we used a repeated 
measures ANOVA for the forward and reverse events separately. To estimate the 
peak in this distribution, it was mean-normalized and fminsearch (Matlab 2015a, 
Mathworks) used to minimize the RMS difference between the data and a mean-
normalized Gaussian function in which the center, height and s.d. were allowed to 
vary. The center of the fitted distribution was used to define the peak lag.
Finally, we compared the grid–place cell coherence exhibited by the grid cells 
against their directional modulation and hexagonal symmetry (i.e., gridness). 
The mean coherence for each grid cell estimated from all events was compared 
against the KL12 divergence and modified gridness scores16 obtained from the 
foraging sessions using a Spearman rank order correlation. Furthermore, we 
assessed the statistical significance of grid–place cell replay coherence scores for 
directional (KL divergence >0.15)12 and nondirectional (KL divergence 0.15) 
cells separately, using the same AUC test described above. Moreover, we carried 
out the aforementioned time-shift analysis separately for directional and nondi-
rectional cells as well. Finally, we also directly compared the replay coherence of 
the directional cells with the nondirectional cells using a two-sample t-test.

Histology. Rats were anesthetized (4% isoflurane and 4 L per min O2), 
injected intraperitoneally with an overdose of Euthatal (sodium pentobarbital) 
 
after which they were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% para-

carefully removed and stored in 4% PFA–PBS, which was exchanged for 4% 
PFA–PBS with 20% sucrose 2–3 d before sectioning. Subsequently, 40–50 µm 
frozen coronal sections were cut using a cryostat, mounted on gelatin-coated 
glass slides and stained with cresyl violet. Images of the sections were acquired 
using a Leica microscope (DM5500). Sections in which clear tracks from tetrode 
bundles could be seen were used to determine the locations of cells recorded.

Statistical test. To assess place cell replay events for statistical significance we 
used a non-parametric spatial shuffle, described above, and percentile ranked 
each event against its own shuffle. Similarly, to assess grid–place cell coherence 
for significance we used a non-parametric area under the curve (AUC) test, using 
95% confidence intervals to assess statistical significance (if the confidence inter-
val did not contain 0 we deemed a result significant). For the alternative event 
ratemap method (see above) we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank non-parametric 
test. Spearman rank-order correlation was used to assess the relationships between 
grid–place cell coherence and gridness and directional modulation of grid cells. 
Finally, to assess bias for grid cell participation in forward (versus reverse) replay 
events we used a chi-square test. None of the described non-parametric tests make 
assumptions regarding normality or equality of variance.
Parametric test were only used to assess differences in grid cell rates during 
and outside replay events (paired t-test), grid–place cell coherence for direc-
tional and nondirectional cells (independent samples t-test), and variation in 
grid–place cell coherence across different grid cell time shifts (repeated measures 
ANOVA). Data distributions for these tests were assumed to be normal but this 
was not formally tested.
All tests were two-sided. No statistical methods were used to prede-
termine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in 
 
previous publications6,7.
