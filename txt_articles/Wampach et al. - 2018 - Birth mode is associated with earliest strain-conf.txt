The rate of caesarean section delivery (CSD) is increasing worldwide. It remains unclear
whether disruption of mother-to-neonate transmission of microbiota through CSD occurs and
whether it affects human physiology. Here we perform metagenomic analysis of earliest gut
microbial community structures and functions. We identify differences in encoded functions
between microbiomes of vaginally delivered (VD) and CSD neonates. Several functional
pathways are over-represented in VD neonates, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bio-
synthesis. We link these enriched functions to individual-specific strains, which are trans-
mitted from mothers to neonates in case of VD. The stimulation of primary human immune
cells with LPS isolated from early stool samples of VD neonates results in higher levels of
tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). Accordingly, the observed levels
of TNF-α and IL-18 in neonatal blood plasma are higher after VD. Taken together, our results
support that CSD disrupts mother-to-neonate transmission of specific microbial strains,
linked functional repertoires and immune-stimulatory potential during a critical window for
neonatal immune system priming.

 T
he past decades have witnessed steadily increasing rates in
caesarean section deliveries (CSD) performed largely in the
absence of medical necessity and reaching proportions of
19.1% worldwide and 25% in Europe1,2. During vaginal birth,
specific bacterial strains are transmitted from mothers to
infants3–6 and differences in microbial colonization in neonates
born by CSD have been identified7–10 as early as 3 days
postpartum7,10. However, due to conflicting results, which prin-
cipally imply a negligible impact of delivery mode on the colo-
nizing neonatal microbiome in the gut11, it remains unclear
whether disruption of mother-to-infant transmission of micro-
biota through CSD occurs and whether it affects human phy-
siology early on, with potentially persistent effects in later life. As
the first few days after birth represent a ‘critical window’ in
neonatal health and development12–14, there is growing concern
that disruption of microbial transmission from mother to neonate
is linked to conditions more frequently observed in CSD-born
individuals, including allergies15, chronic immune disorders16
and metabolic disorders17. To address these concerns, it is
essential to determine if there are differences in the functional
complement conferred by the earliest colonizing microbiota in
relation to CSD, if any differences result from changes in the
transmission of strains from mothers to neonates, and if these
impact neonatal physiology.
While the majority of studies so far indicate that delivery mode
is the strongest factor determining early neonatal gut microbiome
colonization3,7–10,18, these effects are either extenuated or largely
absent in other studies11,19. In this context, it is important to
consider that CSD may be performed as a result of underlying
maternal or foetal medical conditions (e.g., multiple gestation,
foetal malpresentation or suspected foetal macrosomia)20 and can
co-occur with other microbiome-influencing factors. More spe-
cifically, CSD is most often accompanied by the administration of
antibiotics to mothers due to local health regulations or hospital
practices (e.g., in case of a positive screening of the mother for
group B Streptococcus)21. Being born small for gestational age
(SGA) frequently coincides with CSD as well (i.e., more than 50%
of all SGA neonates)22. SGA neonates have an elevated propensity
for developing metabolic disorders during childhood or adult-
hood, which has been associated with alterations to the gut
microbiome23, and may be linked to the elevated rate of CSD in
this population.
Apart from confounding factors, the methods and study
designs employed over the past years may in part explain some of
the conflicting results regarding the effect of delivery mode on the
early gut microbiome. Notably, taxonomic profiling based on 16S
rRNA gene amplicon sequencing does not offer sufficient reso-
lution to assess the direct effect of the delivery mode at the level of
strain transmission, which is expected to be a determinant of
succession. Although recent studies have focused on mother-to-
neonate strain transfer and have shown that maternal strains do
colonize the neonatal gut, non-vaginal delivery was not assessed
comprehensively4–6. In addition, although single nucleotide var-
iants (SNVs) have been tracked over time, no such studies have so
far covered the earliest time points after delivery (days 0–5) in
well-matched mother–neonate pairs in relation to a direct com-
parison of delivery modes. Consequently, there is a strong need
for adequate high-resolution metagenomic analyses capable of
resolving the vertical transmission of individual-specific strains
and encoded functions from mothers to neonates on an indivi-
dual basis, while also supplementing observed in silico findings
with further in vitro validation experiments.
Independent of whether prenatal colonization of the foetus
takes place or not24, delivery marks the moment of extensive
exposure to microbial communities of faecal, vaginal, skin and
environmental origins and this event thereby has a profound
impact on the colonization of the neonatal gut9,25. The initial low
microbial biomass in the earliest neonatal stool samples7
makes the sequencing data prone to the over-representation of
putative artefactual reads24,26 and may contribute to the gen-
eration of inconsistent results. Therefore, the removal of any
artefactual sequences is essential to ensure unambiguous, high-
resolution overviews of the earliest microbial colonization of the
neonatal gut.
Here, we performed a detailed analysis of the earliest microbial
colonization of the neonatal gut using a combination of 16S
rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and high-resolution metage-
nomics. Our results highlight differences in gut microbiome
composition according to delivery mode as well as concurrent
differences in the encoded functional potential, which in turn are
linked to differences in the transfer of strains from mother to
neonate. Based on the enrichment of the LPS biosynthesis path-
way in VD neonates, we performed LPS extractions from neo-
natal stool samples, in vitro immune stimulation assays as well as
extensive assessments of LPS purity. The stimulation of primary
human immune cells with purified LPS from the faeces of VD
neonates collected at day 3 postpartum resulted in the production
of higher levels of TNF-α and IL-18. In accordance with these
results, the levels of TNF-α and IL-18 in neonatal blood plasma
were also higher in VD neonates when compared to CSD. Taken
together, we observe a microbiome-driven relationship between
delivery mode and endotoxin-induced immune system priming
with the potential for lasting effects in later life.
Results
Study design and cohort characteristics. To characterize the
temporal patterns of earliest microbial colonization in relation to
delivery mode, we recruited and sampled a total of 33 neonates
(Supplementary Data 1). The neonatal gut microbiome of some of
these neonates had previously been characterized using a com-
bination of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative
real-time PCR7. For a subset of neonates, well-matched neonatal
and maternal samples were subjected to high-resolution meta-
genomic analyses. To differentiate between potential effects of
CSD and/or SGA, neonates born by CSD and neonates born by
CSD and being SGA were included in the cohort and analysed
separately. For each mother–neonate pair, we sampled micro-
biomes of maternal body sites, which are indicated to be
important in relation to neonatal gut colonization (collection of
stool and vaginal swabs; Methods) less than 24 h before delivery.
Additionally, earliest neonatal stool samples were collected at
≤ 24 h, 3 days and 5 days postpartum (63 samples; Supplementary
Data 1). Extracted genomic DNA from all samples was subjected
to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and extracted DNA from
the samples of the subset of mother–neonate pairs were subjected
to random shotgun sequencing. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon
sequencing data were processed using NG-Tax27, while the
resulting metagenomic data were processed using a reproducible,
reference-independent bioinformatic pipeline28.
Removal of artefactual sequences. Neonatal stool samples from
days 1–5 postpartum contain limited amounts of microbial
DNA7,
and
low-biomass
samples
are
prone
to
over-
representation of artefactual DNA that is introduced during the
extraction procedure or preparation of sequencing libraries24,26.
For the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data, any possible
effect from putative artefactual reads was restricted by applying
the methodology previously described in Wampach et al7. To
account for the presence of artefactual sequences in the metage-
nomic data, we devised an additional, combined in vitro and in
silico strategy to identify and remove artefactual sequences from

 the metagenomic data (Fig. 1a). For the in vitro part, DNA was
extracted from a human gut epithelial cell line using the same
procedure as for the neonatal stool samples and diluted to the
levels of DNA extractable from the collected low-biomass samples
(Methods). The choice of human DNA as a negative control was
based on the following criteria: (i) the inability to generate a
sequencing library from blank water control samples due to the
inherent very low amounts of DNA (these are typically below the
threshold for library construction); (ii) the ability to clearly dif-
ferentiate signal (in the titration series: human sequences) from
artefacts (non-human sequences); microbial DNA was not chosen
as the homology between contaminant and bona fide sequences
may have confounded delineation; (iii) the removal of human
sequences is common practice when performing metagenomic
analyses on human samples and appropriate methods exist to
distinguish between human and microbial sequences in silico; (iv)
the blinding of the variability originating from the laboratory
environment or sequencing facility due to the nature of the
samples (i.e., human control samples were treated with the exact
same reagents as the faecal study samples). Our in silico workflow
for the identification and removal of artefacts from metagenomic
data (Fig. 1b) first clusters29 contigs from the artefact control
samples and the study samples together (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
It subsequently removes contigs from study samples that cluster
with the artefactual contigs, i.e., that fall into the same bin
(Supplementary Note 1). After subsequent filtering steps and the
successful removal of artefactual contigs from all study samples,
we observed differences in the number of removed reads
according to sample type (Supplementary Fig. 1b; Supplementary
Data 2). On the basis of this essential data curation step,
sequences from Achromobacter xylosoxidans or Burkholderia spp.
taxa were for example identified and subsequently eliminated
from the bona fide metagenomic data. Using the curated meta-
genomic data, we obtained taxonomic profiles (Supplementary
Data 3), functionally annotated gene sets (Supplementary Data 4),
reconstructed
genomes
following
binning30
and
strain-
determining variant patterns31 (Supplementary Data 5).
Earliest microbial taxonomic profiles. The 16S rRNA gene
amplicon and the metagenomic sequencing data, which were
generated for a subset of mother–neonate pairs, showed highly
similar succession trends in terms of diversity, evenness and
richness measures (Supplementary Fig. 2a & b; Supplementary
Note 2). The taxonomic profiles derived from the 16S rRNA gene
amplicon and metagenomic sequencing were highly correlated
(Supplementary Fig. 3a). The differences in taxonomic profiles
according to delivery mode reflected results from previous stu-
dies, notably the higher relative abundance in Bacteroides and
Parabacteroides and lower levels in Staphylococcus in VD neo-
nates at days 3 and 5 postpartum7,10 (Supplementary Data 6 to 8;
Supplementary Note 3). In order to resolve the effect of delivery
mode in relation to other potentially contributing factors such as
maternal antibiotic intake prior to delivery, gestational age,
feeding regime and sampling time point, differentially abundant
taxa for both 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic
sequencing data were determined separately using a multivariate
additive general model approach (MaAsLin32). Taking into
account the effects of the above-mentioned factors, delivery mode
was found to be the dominant driver of neonatal gut microbiome
colonization, with other measured factors having considerably
less of an effect (Supplementary Note 4; Supplementary Data 9).
Earliest functional differences according to delivery mode. To
assess whether the apparent taxonomic differences between the
gut microbiomes of VD and CSD neonates are reflected at the
level of functional potential, we used the metagenomic sequen-
cing data to calculate Jensen-Shannon divergences for all samples
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). Overall, comparison of the functional
profiles of all neonates to the gut microbial potential of their
respective mothers highlighted that the neonatal gut microbiota
were more divergent from the maternal vaginal microbiota than
the corresponding gut microbiota (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b & c).
We also compared the CSD (±SGA) gut microbiota at day 3 and
day 5 postpartum to those of VD neonates (Fig. 2a). CSD (±SGA)

 neonates lacked most functions at day 3 compared to VD neo-
nates (Supplementary Fig. 5–10), while some appeared at day 5.
Notably, neonatal-maternal correlations between community-
wide functional potentials of the gut microbiomes at days 1, 3 and
5 postpartum were higher for VD than for CSD (±SGA) (Fig. 2b;
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, FDR-adjusted P = 6.0 × 10−3 for day 3
and P = 1.8 × 10−2 for day 5).
We detected a total of 1,697 functional categories from the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology
(KO) database that were differentially abundant in the compar-
isons of the gut microbiome of CSD or CSD + SGA neonates to
VD neonates. These presented the same directionality of change
using the R package DESeq233 with a linear model considering the
different collection time points containing at least 1,000 KOs (days
3 and 5) as covariates (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Data 10). Among
the differentially abundant genes, there was an enrichment in
genes involved in LPS biosynthesis (Fig. 2a; hypergeometric test,
false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P = 1.5 × 10−9), and the
proportion of reads mapping to genes involved in this pathway
was larger in VD neonates compared to both CSD groups
neonates (Fig. 2c; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, FDR-adjusted P =
9.6 × 10−3). Other important microbial metabolic pathways,
which were enriched with differentially abundant genes between
VD and CSD (±SGA), included flagellar assembly (Fig. 2a;
hypergeometric test, FDR-adjusted P = 4.9 × 10−12), bacterial
chemotaxis (Fig. 2a; hypergeometric test, FDR-adjusted P =
1.5 × 10−2), cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance
(Fig. 2a; hypergeometric test, FDR-adjusted P = 4.0 × 10−3), two-
component system (Fig. 2a; hypergeometric test, FDR-adjusted P
= 2.5 × 10−5) and ABC transporters (Fig. 2a; hypergeometric test,
FDR-adjusted P = 1.3 × 10−4). As comparisons between VD and
CSD as well as VD and CSD + SGA were largely matching
independent of SGA status, we combined both groups (CSD and
CSD + SGA) to increase statistical power (CSD ± SGA). Notably,

 all pathways also showed higher relative gene abundances in VD
compared to CSD (±SGA) neonates except for the ABC
transporter pathway (Fig. 2c; Wilcoxon rank-sum test, FDR-
adjusted
P = 4.1 × 10−3,
3.8 × 10−2,
2.2 × 10−4,
2.1 × 10−2,
respectively).
To corroborate the apparent higher propensity of the VD
microbiome for LPS biosynthesis, we annotated the OTUs
resulting from the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data
according to their attributed Gram staining information. Hereby,
we observed that the gut microbiomes of VD neonates harboured
significantly
higher
relative
abundances
of
Gram-negative
bacteria at days 3 and 5 compared to CSD (±SGA) neonates
(Wilcoxon rank-sum test, FDR-adjusted P = 1.7 × 10−3 and P =
4.0 × 10−3 for day 3 and 5 respectively; Supplementary Fig. 3b).
Additionally, the relative abundances of 7,000 KO functional
categories were predicted using PanFP34 based on the extensive
16S rRNA gene amplicon data (Supplementary Data 11). A
multivariate analysis (MaAsLin32) was performed to compare the
functional profiles of CSD (±SGA) to VD neonates and for both
generated data sets (i.e., predicted KO functional categories based
on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data and annotated KOs
based on metagenomic sequencing data). Results from the
multivariate analyses demonstrated that delivery mode was the
strongest determining factor in both data sets (i.e., predicted and
metagenomics-based
KOs)
for
explaining
the
differentially
abundant genes (Supplementary Data 9). Whilst not statistically
significant, the trends for the predicted microbial pathways
obtained with PanFP were largely concordant with the enriched
pathways in VD neonates based on the differential analysis of the
metagenomic
data.
Nevertheless,
predictions
of
functional
potentials based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data
are likely unreliable as a significant fraction of the gut
microbiome (i.e., up to 40%) is represented by microorganisms
without a sequenced isolate genome35. In contrast, the metage-
nomic data, through resolving the actual functional gene
complement, allows a detailed comparison of the functional
potential of the earliest gut microbiomes, as well as the tracking of
individual-specific single-nucleotide variants (SNVs).
Vertical transfer of enteric strains from mothers to neonates.
To determine if the observed differences in microbial functions
were encoded by specific strains that were vertically transferred
from the mother to the neonate, we mined the metagenomic
sequencing data to identify microbial taxa and strains that both
members of any of the 16 maternal–neonatal pairs, for which we
had generated metagenomic data, had in common. We devised an
ensemble approach to link reconstructed genomes on the basis of
taxonomic annotations30,, similarity of phylogenetic marker
genes and the presence of SNVs31 (Methods). This enabled the
tracking of specific strains from mothers to neonates (Supple-
mentary Data 5). Given the high degree of specificity, the pre-
sence of transferred strains is highly relevant on a pair-by-pair,
individual basis to assess mother-to-neonate transfer. This is all
the more important given the extensive inter-individual varia-
bility of the neonatal gut microbiome (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Mother-to-neonate transfer differed between VD and CSD
(±SGA), with significantly more maternal strains being shared by
VD neonates than CSD (±SGA) neonates (Fig. 3a; Wilcoxon rank
sum test: P = 3 × 10−3). While the reconstructed genomes of 25
taxa belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were
identified in maternal–neonatal pairs for all birth modes (mostly
the
skin-derived
and
upper-gastrointestinal
tract-inhabiting
genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp.), the reconstructed
genomes of 23 enteric taxa belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes
and Actinobacteria (notably Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium
spp.) were exclusively observed in VD pairs. Notably, in the case
of vaginal delivery, multiple strains of Gram-positive bacteria
(e.g., Bifidobacterium) were transferred from mother to neonate
(Fig. 3a; transmission in 71% of all VD neonates, 0% in CSD ±
SGA on days 3 and 5), as well as Gram-negative bacteria (e.g.,
Bacteroidetes; Fig. 3a; transmission in 79% of all VD neonates, 0%
in CSD and 20% in CSD + SGA on days 3 and 5).
Linking
differentially
abundant
functions
to
transferred
strains. To compare the levels of genetic divergence between
early colonizing microbial populations over time, we calculated
fixation indices (FST) and intra-population diversity (π), on
the basis of the resolved SNVs. Our results reflected a shift in
population structures during the transfer from mothers to neo-
nates. We observed higher fixation indices (Wilcoxon signed-
rank test: P < 4 × 10−3) between maternal and neonates’ strains
(M:3 and M:5; Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 11a) compared to
the same transferred strains observed at different times within
the neonates (i.e., 3:5). Moreover, intra-population diversity
tended to increase during the first days of life for strains that
were not transmitted from the mother and belonged to the
phylum Firmicutes, as seen in CSD compared to VD neonates
(Wilcoxon rank sum test for day 5 versus day 3: P = 1 × 10−2;
Fig. 3c; Supplementary Fig. 11b), suggesting that new strains
invaded the neonatal gut during this short time period. The dif-
ferences in relative abundance of taxa corresponded to the
inferred routes of transmission linked to birth mode. For exam-
ple, the metagenomic operational taxonomic unit (mOTU) Bac-
teroides dorei/vulgatus was more abundant in VD neonates,
whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis was more abundant in CSD
(±SGA) neonates (Fig. 3d, e). While the same strain of B. vulgatus
was present in paired maternal and neonatal samples in the VD
group (Fig. 3f), S. epidermidis strains were observed only in CSD
neonates (Fig. 3g), suggesting an origin outside the maternal gut
or vaginal environment. Taken together, these results are con-
sistent with the transmission of strains from the maternal gut
microbiome during vaginal delivery, resulting in relatively stable
colonization of the neonatal gut during the earliest days, in
contrast to CSD neonates.
To assess whether the transferred strains conferred specific
functional traits to the neonate or not, we assessed the genomic
complements of the earliest microbiota. Analysis of reconstructed
genomes that were linked to maternal metagenomes showed that
vertically transmitted strains were more likely to be enriched in
functions that were depleted in CSD neonates (odds ratio (OR)
5.0, Fisher’s exact test P = 2.4 × 10−11). Among these strains,
Bacteroidetes (B. vulgatus and other Bacteroides species) and
Clostridium spp. were common. Most strikingly, a B. vulgatus
genome, which shared the majority of SNVs with the correspond-
ing maternal reconstructed genome, was enriched in functions
that were significantly more abundant in VD neonates compared
to CSD (±SGA) neonates (OR = 3.7, FDR-adjusted P = 3.0 × 10
−186; Fig. 3h). By contrast, strains of Staphylococcus aureus, an
uncharacterized Actinobacterium and S. epidermidis encoded
functions that were more prevalent in association with CSD. The
reconstructed genome of S. epidermidis (Fig. 3i) was enriched
(OR = 4.1, FDR-adjusted P = 5.9 × 10−57) in functions with
higher relative abundances in CSD (±SGA) neonates, and
considerably fewer SNVs were shared with the respective mother.
These results indicate that vaginal delivery not only favours the
vertical transfer of enteric strains from mother to neonate, but
also results in the transfer of specific functional traits to the
neonate, which are involved in important microbial pathways
such as LPS biosynthesis and may be relevant in stimulating the
developing immune system during the first days of life.

 Immunostimulatory potential of the earliest gut microbiome.
As LPS forms part of the outer membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria, the attributed Gram staining information of micro-
organisms directly corresponds to their propensity to synthetize
LPS. Importantly, LPS is a highly potent innate immune
activator that is recognized by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4.
The earliest VD gut microbiome exhibited an enrichment in
the microbial LPS biosynthesis pathway (Figs. 2a and 3h) as
well
as
in
Gram-negative
taxa,
which
were
frequently
transmitted from the mother (Fig. 3a). This observation is sup-
ported by the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data (Sup-
plementary
Fig.

Consequently,
an
apparent
higher
microbial synthesis of LPS likely results in an increased immu-
nostimulatory potential of the developing gut microbiome.
To test whether the VD-associated colonizing gut microbiota,
which encode a specific functional complement (including
an enrichment in genes involved in LPS biosynthesis), drives
early physiological differences in VD neonates, we focussed on

 the
early
immunostimulatory
potential
of
LPS
from
the
neonatal gut.
Based on our data, the microbial composition differed most
strongly in VD and CSD neonates on day 3 postpartum and
thereby may critically affect the developing immune system at
this time12. We isolated LPS from faecal samples from day 3 with
sufficient biomass from 16 neonates (7 VD, 7 CSD, 2 CSD +
SGA; Supplementary Data 12; Methods). We subsequently used
several approaches to assess the purity of the isolated LPS
fractions (Supplementary Note 5; Methods). Using agarose and
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we successfully visualized the
isolated LPS and did not find traces of protein contamination but
observed minor traces of fragmented DNA. However, this DNA
did not contribute considerably to the immunostimulatory effect
of the LPS fractions (Supplementary Fig. 12). No contamination
with peptidoglycan or other bacterial molecules containing the D-
glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid moiety were detected in the
isolated LPS fractions using the highly sensitive HEK-Blue™
reporter cells overexpressing the receptors hTLR2, hNOD1 and
hNOD2, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 13; Methods). Some
microbial products detected by hTLR2 (e.g., lipoteichoic acid,
lipoprotein from Gram-positive bacteria, lipoarabinomannan
from Mycobacteria or zymosan from yeast cell walls) were likely
present in LPS samples for which high amounts of LPS were
obtained from faecal samples. Conclusively, the isolated LPS
fractions were assessed to be of high purity based on the HEK-
Blue™ cell assays, although some unknown microbial products
may play a stimulatory role in the high-yield LPS fractions (1 ng
of standard LPS and an average of 2.9 ng of LPS isolated from VD
neonates; Supplementary Fig. 13b). Consequently, the composi-
tion of the different isolated LPS fractions played a role in the
subsequently triggered immune response.
To assess the stimulatory effect at the interface between the
neonatal innate and adaptive immune systems36, we stimulated
monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) from 12 adult donors
with neonatal LPS extracts (Methods). In order to reflect the
in vivo situation as closely as possible, we stimulated the MoDCs
with the exact same LPS volume that was obtainable from
the same initial amount of faecal material from each neonate
sample and subsequently measured levels of the LPS-inducible
cytokine TNF-α in the supernatants using an ELISA assay
(Fig. 4a; Supplementary Data 13). In parallel, a panel of additional
cytokines was measured using an approach for quantifying and
normalizing the employed LPS fractions (Methods). This was
based on a maximum stimulation of MoDCs with 100 Endotoxin
Units (EU) of LPS in order to mimic the amount of LPS an
immune cell may encounter within a given neonatal sample
(Supplementary Figure 14; Supplementary Data 14 and 15).
The levels of all measured cytokines, and especially of TNF-α
and IL-18, were higher in culture supernatants from MoDCs
treated with LPS from VD neonates (Supplementary Fig. 14;
Supplementary Data 16; Supplementary Note 6). Based on the
outcome of all applied methods, we observed that the nature and
composition of the different LPS subtypes contributed to the level
of immune activation triggered by the LPS fractions from the
different samples. Taken together, these results demonstrate
higher immunostimulatory potentials of the earliest gut micro-
biome in neonates born by VD compared to CSD.
To test whether potential effects of differential immunostimu-
lation are apparent early on in vivo, we assessed cytokine levels in
plasma samples from a total of 31 neonates (Supplementary
Data 1). Plasma samples were collected on the same day as the
neonatal faecal samples from which LPS was isolated, i.e., day 3
postpartum. Levels of IL-18 were significantly higher in the VD
group compared to the CSD group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
FDR-adjusted P = 2.4 × 10−3; Fig. 4b), as were the levels of TNF-
α (FDR-adjusted P = 3.0 × 10−2; Fig. 4b, Supplementary Data 17;
Supplementary Note 7), which is consistent with previous results

Discussion
Here we employed high-resolution, artefact-curated metagenomic
analyses of paired, high-quality samples from mothers and neo-
nates to resolve the neonatal gut microbiome over the first few
days of life. While previous studies have used analogous analytical
approaches (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metage-
nomics) to resolve the early neonatal gut microbiome, these
studies did not involve the systematic collection and appropriate
preservation of paired mother–neonate samples11, they did not
specifically track vertical strain transfer11,18, they did not include
provisions for the removal of artefactual sequences3,5,6,11,18, they
did not focus on the earliest time points after delivery3,18, nor did
they resolve differences in functional potential according to
delivery mode3,5,6,11,18. However, consideration of these factors
is essential to assess the effect of delivery mode on the earliest
transfer of community structure and function, subsequent
microbiome colonization patterns and the resulting effects on
neonatal physiology. Our cohort included paired sample sets
from mothers (i.e., vaginal swabs and stool collected prior to
delivery) and their respective neonates (i.e., stool collected at days
1, 3 and 5 and blood plasma at day 3) born by distinct delivery
modes. All microbiome samples yielded high-resolution, artefact-
curated sequencing data, which was analysed at the strain level.
As earliest neonatal gut microbiome samples are naturally of
low biomass, the accurate identification and curation of potential
artefactual sequences is essential. In the absence of appropriate
controls, sequences derived from contaminant taxa in reagents
may be relatively prominent, thereby masking actual signals and
confounding results regarding in particular the transfer of taxa
and functions from mothers to neonates. In our study, adequate
controls were included and putative artefactual reads removed
based on a combined in vitro and in silico workflow. In order to
reach the required specificity to unambiguously address the
question of vertical transmission of microbial community struc-
ture and function from mother to neonate, the use of curated,
high-resolution metagenomic sequencing data (rather than solely
performing 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) is imperative.
More specifically, the applied methodological approach allows the
highly specific tracking of individual microbial functions and
strains from mother to neonates on a case-by-case basis. Our
results based on both 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic
sequencing, and supported by multivariate analyses, demonstrate
that early differences exist in the gut microbiomes of neonates
and that these differences are predominantly driven by the mode
of delivery. Our data agrees with previously reported differences
in microbial composition related to birth mode, notably the
increased relative abundance of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides
in VD neonates as well as OTUs assigned to Staphylococcus being
enriched in CSD neonates3,4,7,39. No fundamental differences in
taxonomical compositions nor functional potentials were appar-
ent when comparing CSD and CSD + SGA neonates, indicating
that delivery mode is a stronger determinant for neonatal gut
microbial colonization than SGA status.
In line with the broad taxonomic differences between VD and
CSD, our findings demonstrate that CSD significantly affects the
functional gene complement of the earliest neonatal gut micro-
biome by impeding the vertical transfer of specific bacterial
strains from the maternal gut microbiome to the neonate. Con-
sequently, the gut of CSD neonates is most likely colonized by
strains derived from other sources, such as breast milk, skin or
saliva, as suggested in previous studies40–42. Notably, a selection
of enteric strains from the mother was found to be exclusively
transferred to the VD neonate (e.g., Bacteroidetes). When mea-
suring population differentiation (FST), we found evidence that
strains acquired from the mother are capable of quickly adapting
to the new environment, as observed previously5. In contrast,
vaginal strains harboured a low potential to stably colonize the
neonatal gut thereby further adding to recently published data
demonstrating that vaginal taxa do not play a prominent role in
the initial colonization of the neonatal gut5. This may in part be
explained by the distinct niches of the anaerobic gastrointestinal
environment and the microaerophilic vaginal environment. With
respect to ongoing clinical interventions aimed at restoring the
earliest neonatal gut microbiome in the case of caesarean sec-
tion43, our findings raise questions over the expected efficiency of
microbiota engraftment from a purely vaginal source and suggest
that gut-derived strains may be more efficacious.
Independent of the precise mechanism of strain transfer, we
observed that several functional pathways were significantly
under-represented in CSD neonates, while these were in turn
enriched in VD neonates and linked to vertically transmitted
strains, in particular the LPS biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 2a). LPS,
an outer surface membrane component of Gram-negative bac-
teria, promotes the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
thereby sits at the interface of the earliest gut microbiome colo-
nization and neonatal immune system priming. Following the
apparent enrichments in LPS biosynthesis in VD neonates due to
higher amounts of Gram-negative bacteria, the subsequent
extraction and quantification of LPS from neonatal stool and
stimulation of primary human immune cells therewith demon-
strated a reduced immunostimulatory potential of the earliest gut
microbiome in CSD neonates. The differences in earliest immune
system priming may result in persistent effects on human phy-
siology in later life, which has also been recently suggested based
on work in a murine model44. On the basis of the observed
immunogenicity of the purified LPS fractions, it has not escaped
our attention that other factors, including the actual LPS com-
position, may additionally contribute to the difference in the
immunostimulatory potential of the colonizing gut microbiome
(Fig. 4a; Supplementary Note 6). Furthermore, other bacterial
products, triggering for example TLR2, may contribute towards
the observed higher immunostimulatory potential of faecal LPS
from VD neonates (Supplementary Fig. 13; Supplementary
Note 5). Considering the potential repercussions on neonatal
physiology, the detailed elucidation of these additional factors will
be the subject of future work.
Our
study
highlights
differences
in
immunostimulatory
potential of the earliest gut microbiome according to delivery
mode. This occurs during a critical window of immune system
priming. Notably, alterations to early immune system stimulation
may be linked to the higher propensity of CSD infants to develop
chronic diseases in later life2. For example, previous studies
focusing on environmental exposure in early life have suggested
that the exposure to Gram-negative bacteria and/or environ-
mental endotoxins (such as LPS) could confer protective effects
towards allergy development45,46. In this context, LPS is likely
closely involved in the priming of the neonatal immune system
and the subsequent tolerance towards the colonizing gut micro-
biome during a most critical window in early neonatal life12–14.
Using a mouse model, it has been shown that strongly immu-
nostimulatory LPS can contribute to the protection from
immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes47 and that disruption
of host-commensal interactions in early-life can lead to persistent
defects in the development of specific immune subsets12. On the
basis of additional cytokine measurements in neonatal plasma,
VD neonates displayed higher levels of IL-18 and TNF-α, thereby
indicating a link between the immunostimulatory potential of
microbial LPS in the gut and the overall immune status of the

 neonatal host early on. Investigations of the longer-term con-
sequences of these differences between CSD and VD neonates will
be necessary to assess their possible impact on the development of
chronic diseases in later life.
Apart from LPS biosynthesis, other pathways that were sig-
nificantly enriched in the gut microbiome of VD neonates
included genes involved in membrane transport, i.e., ATP-
binding cassette (ABC) transporters. On the one hand this may
reflect the adaptation of the colonizing microbiome of VD neo-
nates to the gut environment through enhanced nutrient intake.
On the other hand, associated ABC transporter proteins for both
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have previously been
shown to be immunogenic48, which may suggest that they play a
role in the activation of the neonatal immune system. Addition-
ally, enrichments in pathways relating to bacterial motility were
observed. These included the two-component system pathway,
which is an important mediator of signal transduction, flagellar
assembly and bacterial chemotaxis. These pathways are essential
for bacterial motility in response to external stimuli and conse-
quently also for competition with other members of the gut
microbiome49. Additionally, flagellin, the main structural com-
ponent of the flagellum, is an effective stimulator of innate
immunity50 and promotes mucosal immunity through the acti-
vation of TLR551. Another functional pathway that is potentially
interacting with the human immune system early on is the
resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP). While this
resistance has been observed in all major commensal phyla and
across all members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, this pathway is
essential to evade detection by the human immune system
through the modification of the microbial LPS structure52. In the
context of our study, an enrichment in CAMP resistance may
therefore prevent the dominant colonizers (i.e., Bacteroidetes)
from being recognized by the immune system and subsequently
removed from the VD neonatal gut. Future studies are needed to
assess whether the gut microbiome of VD neonates harbours
more modified LPS moieties linked to CAMP resistance and
which potential effects the altered LPS structures may have on the
neonatal immune system. In accordance with the observation of
an apparent enrichment in flagellar biosynthesis, bacterial che-
motaxis and CAMP resistance, other microbiota-derived mole-
cular factors, apart from LPS, may be involved in early immune
system priming.
Our results imply that a more comprehensive understanding of
the effect of the earliest microbial exposure on innate and
adaptive immune responses and the different molecular factors
involved in neonatal immune system priming is necessary. Future
long-term follow-up studies based on larger cohorts, high-
resolution multi-omic analyses, detailed immunological screen-
ing and tracking of health status will be essential to unravel the
interdependencies between mode of delivery, other potential
confounding factors, mother-to-neonate transmission, micro-
biome colonization, exposure to microbial factors, immune sys-
tem
priming
and
long-term
health
status.
Furthermore,
additional sources of maternal strains of importance in relation to
microbiome-conferred molecular factors, besides the maternal
vagina and gut, have to be considered to assess their relative
importance in relation to their impact on neonate physiology. For
this, additional samples may be obtained from maternal milk,
skin, the oral cavity, and the hospital environment5,11,40–42. An
additional focus should be placed on uncovering the source and
mode of transfer of gut strains from mothers to neonates. Such
mechanistic understanding will be important for devising future
clinical interventions principally aimed at restoring a VD-like
pioneering microbiota in the case of CSD. An alternative
approach may consist of ensuring appropriate early priming of
the neonatal immune system by the controlled provision of
microbial antigens. Both avenues may provide the basis for the
development of preventative strategies for adverse health effects
in CSD neonates in the future.
Methods
Ethics. Written informed consent was obtained before specimen collection from all
enrolled mothers after a detailed consultation. All aspects of recruitment as well as
collection, handling, processing and storing of samples and data were approved by
the Luxembourg ethics board, the Comité national d’éthique de recherche, under
reference number 201110/06 and by the Luxembourg National Commission for
Data Protection under reference number A005335/R000058.
Clinical metadata. All study participants were enrolled and gave birth at the
Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg (CHL). Exclusion criteria for mother–neonate
pairs included the administration of antibiotics to neonates immediately post-
partum, birth prior to 34 weeks of gestation, and maternal gestational diabetes.
Clinical metadata for all the analysed time points (days 1, 3 and 5 postpartum) are
listed in Supplementary Data 1. Recorded metadata include information on the
delivery mode, classification of caesarean section as elective or emergent, birth
weight, gestational age, identification of the neonate as small for gestational age
(SGA status) where relevant, gender, body length, weight and feeding regime. If a
neonate received formula milk at any collection time point, the neonate was
considered having received combined feeding for the remainder of the study, as
even short-term formula feeding has been shown to cause profound and long-
lasting shifts in the gastrointestinal microbiome composition53. Enrolled pairs of
mothers and neonates (n = 16 pairs) included one twin birth (C115 (CSD) and
C116 (CSD + SGA)).
Sample collection. Neonatal faecal samples were collected during the first 24 h as
well as at days 3 and 5 after birth. Samples and data were collected at the CHL until
day 3 after birth; subsequent samples were collected at home by trained study
nurses. From the 33 neonates that were recruited into the study, the gut micro-
biome of 15 (Supplementary Data 1) had previously been characterized using a
combination of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative real-time
PCR7. For a subset of neonates, the mother was sampled additionally. Maternal
samples (vaginal swabs and faeces) were collected less than 24 h before delivery.
Samples were collected into sterile plastic tubes, immediately flash-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further processing. Neonatal blood was col-
lected by capillary or venous sampling, and plasma was isolated and stored at −80 °
C from 31 healthy neonates (13 VD, 13 CSD, five CSD + SGA) at day 3
(28 samples) or day 5 (three samples) after birth, including 15 of the 16 neonates
for whom metagenomic data were analysed (six VD, four CSD, five CSD + SGA),
two neonates for whom no metagenomic but 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing
data were available (two CSD) and 14 neonates (seven VD, seven CSD) that were
sampled under the same conditions7 (Supplementary Data 1). Clinical data were
stored on secure servers at the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine
(LCSB), and biological samples were stored until further processing at the Inte-
grated BioBank of Luxembourg (IBBL), which is NF S96-900:2011 certified.
Sample processing and extraction of nucleic acids. Genomic DNA was isolated
from vaginal swabs with the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories;
Antwerp, Belgium) with an additional step to increase extraction yield involving
the incubation of the samples in PowerSoil tubes with solution C1 at 65 °C for 10
min prior to homogenization for 5 min at 20 Hz in an Oscillating Mill MM 400
(Retsch, Haan, Germany). DNA was subsequently extracted following the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
Faecal samples and cell-culture pellets were processed with the Powerlyzer
PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories), optimized for low-yield
samples. Bead solution (500 µl), C1 (60 µl), UltraPure™ Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl
Alcohol (25:24:1, v/v; Invitrogen, Aalst, Belgium; 200 µl) and 50 mg neonatal stool
or 150 mg maternal stool were added to a dry glass bead tube, incubated at 65 °C
for 10 min, and homogenized by milling for 45 s at 4 m s−1 in a FastPrep-24 5 G
(MP Biomedicals, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France). Samples were centrifuged for 1
min at 12,000 g. Solutions C2 (250 µl) and C3 (100 µl) were added to the
supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 5 min, centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 g, then
700 µl of solution C4 and 600 µl of 100% ethanol were added to the supernatant
and mixed. 650 µl were loaded onto a Spin Filter and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1
min. This step was repeated until all lysate had passed through the filter. For the
higher input-mass maternal faecal samples, the same isolation procedure was
followed except that the filters were washed with a mix of 300 µl solution C4 and
370 µl 100% ethanol, with centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. This latter step
was omitted for the low input neonatal samples. All filters were washed with 650 µl
100% ethanol, then 500 µl solution C5. After drying, 60 µl solution C6 was added to
the centre of the filter and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. DNA was
eluted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 s. RNase A (100 µg ml−1, 2 µl) was
added and incubated at 37 °C for ≥ 30 min. Then, one-tenth volume 3 M sodium
acetate (pH 6.8) and two volumes isopropanol were added to precipitate the DNA
on ice prior to centrifugation. The pellet was washed with 150 µl 70% ethanol,

 before the dried DNA was dissolved in 50 µl (neonatal faecal samples) or 100 µl
(maternal faecal samples) RNase-free water. To obtain an artefact control sample,
DNA was extracted from 800,000 trypsinized Caco-2 cells/ml. Caco-2 cells were
grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Ghent,
Belgium) containing 20% v/v foetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
(Invitrogen) to prevent microbial growth. DNA was extracted with the low-
biomass protocol described above, subsequently titrated and samples with 480, 240,
120, 60 and 30 ng total mass were sequenced. DNA integrity and quantity were
determined for extracted samples of all origins on 1% agarose gels and in a Qubit
2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Extracted DNA was stored at −80 °C
until further use.
DNA sequencing. All DNA samples (along with 8 controls) underwent standard
amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes using primers 515F- 5′-
GTGBCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′ and 805R- 5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAA
TCC-3′ at the Center for Analytical Research and Technology–Groupe Inter-
disciplinaire de Génoprotéomique Appliquée (CART-GIGA; Liège, Belgium).
Selected DNA samples of maternal (vaginal and faecal extracts), neonatal (faecal
extracts at days 1, 3 and 5) and cell-culture origins were subjected to random
shotgun sequencing (Supplementary Data 1). Metagenomic libraries were con-
structed with an optimized low-quantity DNA library preparation kit and
sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) at GATC Biotech (Konstanz,
Germany). For neonatal samples collected from C105, C109, C110 and C119
metagenomic libraries were prepared using TruSeq DNA Nano kit (Illumina) and
sequenced on a NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina) at LCSB Sequencing Platform. A
total of 84% of the study samples (63 of 75) collected from the mother–neonate
pairs yielded sufficient DNA for metagenomic sequencing and sufficient artefact-
curated metagenomic data for subsequent analyses.
Metagenomic data processing. Metagenomic data sets were processed with the
Integrated Meta-omic Pipeline (IMP; version 1.3), which performs pre-processing,
assembly, functional annotation of predicted genes and downstream analyses of
Illumina next-generation sequencing metagenomic data in a single, reproducible
workflow28. Illumina TruSeq3-PE-2 adapter sequences were trimmed from the
reads in the pre-processing step (including the removal of human reads), and the
de novo assembly step used the MEGAHIT54 metagenome assembler. The IMP
parameters were customized for different sample types: default parameters were
retained for maternal faecal samples; for low-biomass samples (maternal vaginal
swabs, neonatal faecal samples from days 1, 3 and 5 and cell culture sample), the
integrated VizBin29 sequence cut-off length was set to 1.
Curation of metagenomic data from artefacts. To identify and exclude arte-
factual sequences in the low biomass samples, contigs were assembled from the
sequencing reads obtained from the DNA extracts of the Caco-2 cells after the
removal of human reads. Given that the Caco-2 cells were cultured in the presence
of 1% penicillin–streptomycin, that the routine surveys for Mycoplasma were
negative, and that the metagenomic sequencing data did not include any Myco-
plasma sequences, any bacterial contamination of the mammalian cell culture
could be confidently excluded. Then, metagenomic reads from each study sample
were mapped against these contigs using Bowtie 255 (version 2.0.2). Matching
sequences were excluded prior to taxonomic profiling of metagenomic reads by
phylogenetic markers35. As the artefactual sequences identified in the control
samples did not represent full genomes, we further used a binning-based approach
to identify additional potential artefactual sequences of the same organism among
the de novo assembled contigs of the study samples. After removing the rRNA
sequences from the contigs56, we performed joint binning of control cell-culture
contigs with each of the samples’ contigs individually using VizBin29 without any
length cut-off. Bins were identified based on VizBin embeddings56 using density-
based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), without correction
for the depth of coverage and completeness. All distinct bins (total length < 10
Mbp) that contained > 0.01% of the total contig length of the cell-culture control
sample were considered putative reconstructed genomes of artefactual DNA, and
the corresponding contigs were removed from the study samples in silico.
Functional profiling. Genes were predicted from contigs assembled with IMP and,
after removing artefactual contigs, these genes were functionally annotated with
hidden Markov models (HMMs)56 trained for all KO57 groups. The functional KO
HMMs were aligned using HMMER 3.158,59. The best hit KO (if multiple KOs
could be assigned to a gene, the KO with the highest bit score was chosen) for every
gene was assigned if the bit score was higher than the binary logarithm of the
number of target genes. The FeatureCounts60 tool with arguments –p and –O was
used to extract the number of reads per KO (Supplementary Data 4; representing
mean ± standard deviation 77 ± 13 % of all mapping reads).
Linking genome reconstructions by marker gene sequence homology. The
curated contigs were binned based on the VizBin embeddings using DBSCAN as
well as correction by the depth of coverage and completeness56. The reconstructed
genomes of all samples belonging to a mother–neonate pair were merged into a
union set. For each sample set, predicted amino acid sequences were searched
against and annotated using a defined set of essential marker genes61 using
HMMER 3.158. Protein sequences assigned to 35 specific marker genes that form
the cross-section of previously suggested sets of phylogenetic marker genes61,62
were selected. These marker amino acid sequences were clustered with CD-HIT63
at 97.5% identity. The frequencies of genes from different genome reconstructions
co-occurring in the same clusters were determined. A simple graph network
representation was constructed with the reconstructed genomes as nodes and
counts of co-occurrences between two reconstructed genomes as weighted,
undirected edges. Highly interlinked sub-networks, representing related recon-
structed genomes, were detected with the cluster_fast_greedy algorithm64 imple-
mented in the R package igraph (v.1.0.1). The resulting reconstructed genomes
from a given sub-network were manually inspected, and the taxonomy of recon-
structed genomes was assigned using PhyloPhlAn30 (Supplementary Data 5).
Strain-level analysis. Strains that occurred in multiple samples were determined
with StrainPhlAn31, using the pre-processed sequencing read data and recon-
structed genomes. For each sample, taxonomic profiles were generated from pre-
processed reads with MetaPhlAn265 using default settings. Strain reconstructions
were extracted with the sample2markers.py script in StrainPhlAn with default
arguments. StrainPhlAn was used to extract the clades detected in all samples and
to construct reference databases for each clade. The sample-based strain recon-
structions and reference databases of each clade and all reconstructed genomes
were analysed with StrainPhlAn to build multiple sequence alignments and phy-
logenetic trees. The neonatal samples were considered to share strains with
maternal samples if the cophenetic distance between the neonatal microbiome
read-based or reconstructed genome-based markers and the maternal markers was
less than the distance to the markers of any other individual. Trees were visualized
with GraPhlAn (https://bitbucket.org/nsegata/graphlan/wiki/Home). To visualize
the positions of markers in genome reconstructions, the reference markers of the
species assigned to the reconstructed genomes in StrainPhlAn were aligned to the
genome reconstructions post hoc, using blastn and an E value cut-off of 1 × 10−10,
as in StrainPhlAn.
Fixation index and intra-population diversity calculation. For all neonatal
reconstructed genomes that were estimated to be > 65% complete and linked to at
least one other sample of the same neonate or their mother, the fixation index (FST)
and the intra-population diversity (π) were assessed by the presence of SNVs.
Metagenomic sequencing reads were mapped against the reconstructed genomes
using MOSAIK66 (version 2.2), with default parameters. A minimum alignment
identity of 95% was applied to restrict the mapping to reads of the same species67.
Genome–sample combinations generating alignments with a median coverage <
20X and/or a breadth < 40% were not included in downstream analyses. To reduce
bias stemming from variation in coverage, alignments were down-sampled to a
median coverage of 20X using Picard tools (version 1.85; http://broadinstitute.
github.io/picard/). SNV calling was performed with FreeBayes68 (version 1.1.0)
using the -pooled-continuous option on the merged alignment files containing all
samples for the same genome. Potential SNVs were required to be supported by
four or more reads and to have an allele frequency ≥ 1%.
The output from FreeBayes (VCF-file) was used as input for POGENOM
(https://github.com/EnvGen/POGENOM), a Perl-based tool that enables
population-genomic analysis of metagenome samples. POGENOM was used to
calculate the intra-population nucleotide diversity (π), which is defined as the
average number of nucleotide differences per site between any two sequence reads
chosen randomly from the sample population (0 ≤ π < 1). When reads of two or
more samples mapped with sufficient coverage to the same genome, the fixation
index (FST) was calculated, reflecting the population differentiation between a pair
of samples. FST is defined as one minus the average intra-population diversity of
the samples divided by the nucleotide diversity between the samples (inter-
population diversity). POGENOM was tuned to include only the loci recovered in
all samples mapped to the same reference genome, assuring a valid comparison of
the intra-species variation.
Processing of amplicon sequencing data. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene
amplicon sequences was performed with NG-Tax27, with default parameters.
Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned to the taxonomy in an open
reference approach, using USEARCH69 against the SILVA70 16S rRNA gene
amplicon reference database (version 128; Supplementary Data 6). To exclude
sequencing artefacts, only dominant phylotypes were examined by removing OTUs
that were represented by fewer than 10 reads in the study samples.
Analyses of taxonomic profiles. To determine the Gram staining of the bacteria,
we used the NCBI microbial attributes, which can be downloaded from http://
www-ab2.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/megan/taxonomy/microbialattributes.zip.
Final Gram staining was assessed by main staining trends per genus and manually
curated at the family and order levels. Functional community profiles were pre-
dicted based on OTU abundances using PanFP34.
Statistical data analysis. The R statistical software package (version 3.3.3) was
used for statistical analyses and visualization of the taxonomic profiles derived

 from metagenomic and amplicon sequencing. Sum normalization and calculations
of taxon richness (number of metagenomic OTUs (mOTUs) for metagenomic data
or OTUs for amplicon sequencing data), diversity (Shannon), evenness (Pielou)
indices and Spearman correlation coefficients were performed using the vegan R
package. To discover differences in the data sets between the birth modes at the
different collection time points postpartum, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were applied,
with FDR multiple-testing adjustment if applicable. Differential taxonomic abun-
dances (according to delivery mode) were also calculated using ANCOM71 with
Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction at 0.05 false-discovery rate. To
determine the effect of the variables within the metadata, differentially abundant
taxa were also determined using MaAslin32 with default parameters and a q < 0.05
threshold for multi-testing correction. The model used was genus ~ sampling day
+ maternal antibiotic intake + feeding regime + gestational age. Differential ana-
lysis of KO abundance, comparing VD to CSD and VD to CSD + SGA with a
linear model, which considered the different collection time points containing at
least 1000 KOs (days 3 and 5) as covariates, was performed with the R package
DESeq2 version 1.10.133. KOs were considered significantly differentially abundant
in VD and CSD (±SGA) if the FDR-adjusted P value of the Wald test was < 0.05 for
at least one comparison (CSD vs. VD or CSD + SGA versus VD) and the direc-
tionality of change in both comparisons was the same. Principal coordinate analysis
(PCoA) graphs were generated using Jensen-Shannon distances as implemented in
the R package phyloseq72. Differentially abundant pathways were detected through
pathway enrichment analysis using a custom R script56. Tests for the enrichment of
reconstructed genomes with differentially abundant KOs were performed using
Fisher’s exact test and FDR-adjustment for multiple testing in R.
LPS isolation from neonatal faecal samples. LPS was isolated from 16 selected
neonatal faecal samples on the basis of availability of sufficient material. Samples (7
VD, 7 CSD, 2 CSD + SGA; Supplementary Data 12) were collected on day 3 after
birth, and from overnight cultures of Escherichia coli strain K-12 (sub-strain
MG1655). To maximise yields, LPS was purified from three aliquots of 50 mg of
each neonatal faecal sample using the hot phenol–water method73 and further
purification was performed using a modified phenol re-extraction protocol74. For
the E. coli control samples, three 5 ml overnight cultures were diluted to an optical
density (600 nm) of 0.5 and centrifuged. LPS was isolated from cell pellets by the
same protocol as above. LPS for each individual was pooled and quantified using an
ELISA-based endotoxin detection assay (Endolisa; # 609033, Hyglos GmbH,
Germany). From the 16 neonatal faecal samples, 11 produced measurable amounts
of LPS, whereas 5 were under the detection limit (Supplementary Data 12). An
extraction blank was generated using the same LPS isolation protocol.
Quantitative real-time PCR to determine bacterial loads. DNA from all neo-
natal faecal samples used for LPS isolation was diluted (when applicable) to a
concentration of 1 ng l−1 and amplified in duplicates with universal prokaryotic
16S rRNA gene primers 926F and 1062R75 and with specific Escherichia coli pri-
mers Ec461F and Ec780R76 . Primer sequences, annealing temperatures and cycle
details are specified in Supplementary Data 14. Genomic DNA isolated from Sal-
monella Typhimurium LT2 and E. coli strain K-12 (sub-strain MG1655) was used
to prepare standard curves for universal prokaryotic and specific E. coli primers,
respectively. Reaction mixture, measurements and calculations of bacterial load
(nanograms bacterial DNA per milligram stool and nanograms E. coli DNA per
milligram stool) were performed as previously described7 (Supplementary
Data 14). The proportion of E. coli DNA in comparison to total bacterial DNA was
subsequently calculated.
In vitro immunostimulation using LPS from neonatal faecal samples. Primary
human monocytes were isolated from blood samples obtained from the Lux-
embourg Red Cross originating from twelve healthy adult donors. Human neonatal
dendritic cells (DCs) were previously shown to be competent in MHC class I
antigen processing and presentation to the same extent than adult DCs77. Most
importantly, the NF-κB-dependent pathway in TLR-4 signalling is intact in neo-
natal MoDCs as they produce pro-inflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation,
while adult and neonatal DCs are both able to produce comparable levels of TNF-α,
IL-6 and IL-8 in response to LPS78. Isolated monocytes were differentiated into
dendritic cells (MoDCs) in 12-well plates for 5 days in RPMI 1640 medium
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), 20 ng ml−1 each of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (Peprotech, London, UK), 20 ng ml−1 IL-4 (Peprotech) and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen). To assess the immune stimulatory potential
of isolated LPS, we treated MoDCs for 24 h with LPS extracted from VD or CSD
(±SGA) neonatal faecal samples using two different methods; one based on LPS
volume and one based on the normalization of LPS concentration with the bac-
terial load (see below for more information).
As we started from the same amount of material for all the neonatal stool
samples and used the exact same extraction protocol to isolate all LPS fractions for
all samples, we assumed that if we treated MoDCs from the same donor with the
exact same volume of yielded LPS (independent of the concentration of LPS
present), we would realistically emulate the microbial LPS load which immune cells
would be exposed to in vivo and thus be representative of the immunostimulatory
potential of a given sample at 3 days postpartum. To stimulate MoDCs, 7.5 µl of
LPS extract per 105 MoDCs was added per well. For the negative control, MoDCs
were incubated with 7.5 µl of LPS extraction blank, and for the positive control,
MoDCs were treated with 15 endotoxin units (EU) LPS isolated from E. coli
cultures. MoDCs were treated for 24 h to assess the immunostimulatory potential
of the isolated LPS. Treatments were performed in duplicates and tested on at least
three different donors. Culture supernatants from stimulated MoDCs were diluted
1/10 (or 1/50, if above standard curve range) and analysed for the presence of TNF-
α using a commercial ELISA reagent set (Human TNF alpha uncoated ELISA, Life
Technologies, Belgium) and a microplate reader (Biotek instruments, Germany).
For the second method, we verified our results using the bacterial load for
normalizing LPS concentration values. Naturally, all faecal samples have a different
bacterial load within the 150 mg of starting material that is used to isolate LPS. In
order to assess if the differences that we observed before with equal volumes of LPS
(see above) were due to the fact that some samples have a much lower bacterial
load or if also the bacterial composition (and proportion of Gram-negative
bacteria) plays a role in the immunostimulation, we normalized the amount of LPS
used to stimulate MoDCs with the bacterial load. For example, the bacterial load
was highest for VD neonate C105 (Supplementary Data 15; Supplementary
Fig. 14), and the corresponding bacterial load was 51.5 µg DNA per 150 mg stool.
Therefore, this load was divided by the load in each other sample to yield a
normalization factor. To stimulate MoDCs with 100 EU of LPS, 2.51 µl C105 LPS
was added. For other samples, the LPS load was calculated by multiplying 2.51 µl by
the previously determined bacterial normalization factor. For the negative control,
2 × 105 MoDCs were incubated with 15 µl of LPS extraction blank, and for the
positive control 2 × 105 MoDCs were treated with 100 EU LPS isolated from E. coli
cultures. Treatments were performed on cells from four distinct MoDCs donors
(2 × 105 MoDCs/donor), except for LPS isolated from C120, which was only
sufficient to stimulate donor 4’s MoDCs in duplicate. MoDCs and isolated LPS
samples were incubated for 24 h. Culture supernatants from stimulated MoDCs
were diluted twofold and analysed for the presence of seven cytokines (CXCL8/IL-
8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-18 and TNF-α) using a Human Premixed Multi-
Analyte Kit (R&D Systems Europe; UK) and a MagPix multiplex reader (Luminex,
Netherlands), according to the manufacturers’ instructions (Supplementary
Data 16). Statistical significance between the different cohorts was determined
using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Coomassie blue and silver staining of LPS extracts. On the basis of availability
of sufficient extracted LPS material, 0.5 µg of extracted LPS from the stool samples
of two VD neonates (C007 and C111) collected on day 3 after birth, were prepared
with Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Belgium), heated for 5 min at 95 °C and
separated on 12 % Bis-Tris precast gel (Bio-Rad, Belgium) at 200 V for 45 min. As
positive controls, 0.5 µg, 1 µg and 10 µg of commercially available LPS (Escherichia
coli O55:B5, gel-filtration chromatography; Sigma-Aldrich, Belgium) and 10 µg of
E. coli protein extract were used. A precast gel was loaded with the LPS samples
and stained with Coomassie (Imperial protein stain, ThermoFisher, Belgium) to
check for protein contaminations. Silver staining of the gel was performed using a
corresponding kit (SilverQuest, ThermoFisher, Belgium) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
Ethidium bromide staining of LPS extracts. To check if LPS extracts were
contaminated with immunostimulatory nucleic acids, 0.5 µg of extracted LPS from
the stool samples of two VD neonates (C007 and C111), which presented highly
concentrated LPS fractions that could be visualised on agarose gel, were prepared
with DNA loading dye (ThermoFisher, Belgium) and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel.
In addition, 0.5, 1 and 10 µg of commercially available LPS (Escherichia coli O55:
B5, gel-filtration chromatography; Sigma-Aldrich, Belgium) were used to compare
the purity of the LPS samples. As a positive control, 100 ng of E. coli DNA extract
was used. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide, separated at 100 V for 50
min and analysed using a BioDocAnalyse system (Biometra, Germany). To check if
nucleic acid contaminations could be identified in isolated LPS samples and would
result in a TNF-α response, agarose bands were cut out (Supplementary Fig. 12)
and purified using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel,
France). As controls, bands of E. coli DNA and commercially available LPS (10 µg)
were cut out and purified. In addition, a purification blank was generated. The
purified DNA fractions were used to stimulate MoDCs following the same protocol
as for the stimulation with extracted LPS.
HEK-Blue™ cell assay. In order to verify the purity of the extracted LPS fractions,
HEK-Blue™ reporter cell lines overexpressing one of the receptors hTLR2, hTLR4,
NOD1 or NOD2 (InvivoGen, France), were stimulated with LPS extracted from
five selected neonatal faecal samples (three VD and two CSD), which presented
sufficient amounts of extractable LPS. HEK-Blue™ TLR and NOD cells are designed
to detect stimulants of the human receptors by induction of secreted embryonic
alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). For all the cell lines, the levels of SEAP were
determined with HEK-Blue™ Detection (InvivoGen, France), a cell culture medium
that allows for real-time detection of SEAP.

 While the hTLR4 receptor only recognizes LPS, hTLR2 recognizes
peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid and lipoprotein from gram-positive bacteria,
lipoarabinomannan from mycobacteria, and zymosan from the yeast cell wall, the
receptor NOD1 binds to bacterial molecules containing the D-glutamyl-meso-
diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) moiety and NOD2 recognizes bacterial molecules
(peptidoglycans) and stimulates an immune reaction. HEK-Blue™ cells were grown
and maintained in DMEM (4.5 g l−1 glucose, L-glutamine, Sigma-Aldrich,
Belgium), supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Belgium), 100 µg ml−1 Normocin
(InvivoGen, France) and respective selective antibiotics according to the user’s
manual.
To monitor the activation of NF-κB, HEK-Blue™ cells were seeded according to
the user’s manual in HEK-Blue™ Detection medium (InvivoGen, France), in flat-
bottom 96-well plates and stimulated for 22 h with LPS samples. We used two
conditions: first, using the same concentration of LPS, where 1 µl of extracted LPS
(0.01 ng µl−1) was added per well, and second, using the same volume of LPS,
where 7.5 µl extracted LPS was added to 105 HEK-Blue™ cells. To convert
endotoxin activity (EU) into mass (ng), we considered that around 10 EU are
equivalent to 1 ng endotoxin79. For positive controls, HEK-Blue™ NOD1 cells were
stimulated with 1 µl TriDAP (10 µg µl−1, InvivoGen, France), HEK-Blue™ NOD2
cells with 1 µl Murabutide (10 µg µl−1, InvivoGen, France), HEK-Blue™ hTLR2 cells
with 1 µl of Pam3CSK4 (1 µg µl−1; InvivoGen, France) and HEK-Blue™ hTLR4 cells
with 1 µl ultrapure LPS (5 µg µl−1, source strain: ATCC 12014; CDC 5624-50
[NCTC 9701], InvivoGen, France). In addition, all cell lines were treated with 1 µl
ultrapure LPS (5 µg µl−1, InvivoGen, France) and 1 µl ultrapure LPS (0.01 ng µl−1,
InvivoGen, France) as well as with commercially available LPS (standard LPS;
Escherichia coli O55:B5, gel-filtration chromatography; Sigma-Aldrich, Belgium): 1
µl of 5 µg µl−1 and 1 µl of 0.01 ng µl−1. For the negative control, HEK-Blue™ cells
were incubated with 1 µl of endotoxin-free H2O (InvivoGen, France). All
conditions were performed in duplicates and SEAP expression was monitored
using a microplate reader at 655 nm (Biotek instruments, Germany) except for LPS
isolated from C117 where only 7.5 µl extracted LPS/105 HEK-Blue™ cells was added
to the cells and tested in duplicates.
Cytokine profiling of neonatal plasma samples. Plasma samples (n = 31) col-
lected 3 or 5 days postpartum (13 VD, 13 CSD and five CSD + SGA; 28 samples
collected at day 3, 3 samples collected at day 5 postpartum; Supplementary Data 1)
were diluted twofold and analysed for 18 cytokines using a Human Premixed
Multi-Analyte Kit (R&D Systems Europe) and a Bio-Plex analyser multiplex reader
(Bio-Rad, Belgium), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The kit is able to
detect CXCL8/IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12/23 p40, IFN-β, IL-15, IL-21, IL-5,
Galectin-1, IFN-γ, IL-18, IL-27, Granzyme B, IL-13, IL-2, IL-4 and TNF-α. Of these
cytokines, 11 were above the detection limit (CXCL8/IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IL-21,
Galectin-1, IL-18, IL-13, IL-2, IL-4 and TNF-α; Supplementary Data 17).
