Abstract
The purpose of this review is to create a set of provisional criteria for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) to refer to
when assessing the ethical orientation of transgender health research proposals. We began by searching for lit-
erature on this topic using databases and the reference lists of key articles, resulting in a preliminary set of criteria.
We then collaborated to develop the following nine guidelines: (1) Whenever possible, research should be
grounded, from inception to dissemination, in a meaningful collaboration with community stakeholders; (2) lan-
guage and framing of transgender health research should be non-stigmatizing; (3) research should be dissem-
inated back to the community; (4) the diversity of the transgender and gender diverse (TGGD) community should
be accurately reflected and sensitively reflected; (5) informed consent must be meaningful, without coercion or
undue influence; (6) the protection of participant confidentiality should be paramount; (7) alternative consent
procedures should be considered for TGGD minors; (8) research should align with current professional standards
that refute conversion, reorientation, or reparative therapy; and (9) IRBs should guard against the temptation to
avoid, limit, or delay research on this subject.
Keywords: community participation; privacy; research ethics; transgender
Introduction
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) exist to protect the
rights and welfare of potential study participants and to
ensure that research is conducted in an ethical manner.
A favorable IRB review is typically an absolute require-
ment for conducting academic and institutional research
with human participants. However, a diverse spectrum
of research is submitted to these panels and board mem-
bers are required to have, or quickly find, expertise in an
array of topics, which can be challenging.1
This article outlines nine criteria, grounded in a re-
view of the ethical and methodological literature in
this field, to assist IRBs in assessing research projects
on transgender health and especially those that in-
volve transgender and gender diverse (TGGD) partic-
ipants. These criteria may also be helpful to individual
researchers, practitioners, and other professional en-
tities responsible for evaluating research involving
transgender health and TGGD participants. In partic-
ular, the authors hope that they will contribute to the
groundwork preceding the creation of a section on
the ethical conduct of research in the forthcoming
eighth edition of the World Professional Association
for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care

Background
Transgender healthcare is a rapidly growing field, with
an exponential increase in research published in recent
years.2 Within this field there is a small but growing lit-
erature providing guidance on ethical issues in research
involving TGGD individuals. Although some of this
literature is intended for a wider audience, including
IRBs, individual researchers, and clinical practition-
ers, we located three articles presenting specific guide-
lines to IRBs for research with TGGD individuals and
communities.3–5 This article synthesizes these previ-
ous recommendations, additional relevant literature,
and the expert opinion of its authors into a cohesive
set of guidelines for IRBs adjudicating transgender
health research. We hope they will also prove helpful
to individual researchers, practitioners, and profes-
sional organizations.
Methodology
In developing the criteria outlined in this article, the lead
author undertook a comprehensive review of the aca-
demic literature to identify relevant sources. Searches
were conducted for English-language literature on
Google, Google Scholar, and WorldCat by using the
keywords ‘‘transgend*,’’ ‘‘transsex*,’’ ‘‘gender divers*,’’
‘‘Institutional Review Board,’’ ‘‘Research Ethics Board,’’
‘‘Research Ethics Committee,’’ and ‘‘guidance,’’ and ref-
erence lists of key articles were also examined. A pre-
liminary version of criteria for IRBs adjudicating
transgender health research was developed based on
this literature. Transgender health researchers from a va-
riety of different backgrounds were then contacted to
collaborate and co-author the final set of criteria. This
ensured that knowledge and experience from a diverse
range of national and social contexts was taken into con-
sideration in this process.
Areas of Concern
Within the field of transgender healthcare research,
areas identified as particularly important for ethically
and methodologically sound research include defini-
tions of risk and harm, differences between practice
and research, and situations requiring (or not requir-
ing) anonymity.6–8 Also of serious concern is that,
despite extreme marginalization and violence faced
by TGGD individuals, no research on the application
of ethical standards in this population exists within
social and psychological research.4,9 The history of
this field, intersectionality, and researchers’ linguis-
tic choices all play an important role in the current
state of ethics in this field and, thus, what these guide-
lines aim at addressing.
Historical
Transgender health research and practice has not al-
ways been sensitive to the humanity of either individual
TGGD participants or the larger community.4 Some
examples include the pathologizing approach taken
by influential works such as Psychopathia Transsexua-
lis,10 The Sissy Boy Syndrome11 and more recent re-
search into the attractiveness of TGGD children.12
More generally, transgender health research has and
continues to tend toward representing TGGD people
as homogenous and lacking diversity in areas such as,
but not limited to, ethnicity, gender identity, and sexu-
ality.5,13–16 The publication of the first edition of the
WPATH Standards of Care17 addressed some of these
issues and sought to protect both clients and medical
professionals by providing guidance on the treatment
and management of TGGD clients. Unfortunately,
these standards have failed to explicitly outline the eth-
ical conduct of research, which is worrying as some is
conducted in a manner that precludes proper consent
and skirts the line of exploitation, as when patients
are required to participate in research as a condition
of treatment.5,13,18–20
Intersectionality
Intersectional theory recognizes that particular ex-
periences and challenges arise at the intersection of
multiple axes of oppression, and it advises research-
ers to be mindful of the unique experiences (and
vulnerabilities) of individuals experiencing these
intersecting oppressions. For example, Crenshaw21
notes that the challenges faced by black women are
more than the sum of racism and sexism; similarly,
black transgender women encounter specific experi-
ences at the intersection of racist, cisgenderist, and
sexist social forces.22,23 Unfortunately, though inter-
sectionality is frequently discussed within social
sciences and humanities transgender studies schol-
arship,24–29 except in some Western contexts where
research is explicitly undertaken with TGGD people
of color,30–32 it is rarely present in the literature on
transgender health. Despite this, acknowledging and
accounting for intersectional experiences can strengthen
ethical
frameworks

 practices, enhance analyses of difference within
TGGD populations, and ensure the external validity
of results.31–34 Consequently, we integrated an intersec-
tional approach into formulating and explaining our
proposed criteria.
Language
Researchers’ choices of terminology may degrade both
the efficacy of their studies and community trust. For
example, by referring to TGGD women as ‘‘male trans-
sexuals’’13,35 researchers risk alienating participants
and increasing distrust of researchers within trans
communities. In the longer term, this can cause diffi-
culties for the future recruitment and development of
trust with participants.19,36,37 As a result, it is often nec-
essary to establish trust with TGGD participants before
it is possible to gather accurate data. This is particularly
the case when research is conducted in environments
that also provide transgender healthcare, or on topics
that are especially controversial (e.g., the provision of
services for gender nonconforming children).4,19
In this article, the authors have used TGGD, rather
than transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC),
to describe the population being discussed. Though
TGNC is more frequently used in the literature, it
does not appear to be an appropriate or inclusive term
for our purposes.33 In many cultures, particularly the
Global South and Indigenous/Two-Spirit populations,
transgender is not a default term used to identify gen-
ders outside female and male and it may, for this reason,
exclude individuals outside of these contexts.38–40
We have also included a glossary, which should be
of use to those less familiar with this language, identi-
fying and defining the basic transgender healthcare
terminology used in this article (Appendix 1). How-
ever, the nature of language on transgender health
and experience is that it is continuously shifting and
researchers are, therefore, advised to update their fa-
miliarity with it through informed Internet searches
and contact with TGGD organizations.5,35 In addi-
tion, although this glossary may be a helpful starting
point for ensuring that research projects are non-
discriminatory, it should be used in an advisory, rather
than prescriptive fashion.
Criteria
We propose the following nine criteria for IRBs to use in
considering research proposals on transgender health.
We hope that they will also be helpful in advising indi-
vidual researchers, practitioners, and organizations.
However, when putting them into use, please note that
these broad guidelines are not definitive and that exam-
ples are illustrative rather than exhaustive.
Whenever possible, research should be grounded,
from inception to dissemination, in a meaningful
collaboration with community stakeholders
IRBs should consider whether researchers have appro-
priately built, or indicated how they will build, links
with community stakeholders. Failing to meaningfully
incorporate TGGD participation into research can re-
sult in silencing participants, particularly those who
experience complex and intersecting forms of margin-
alization.15,20 This may result in these individuals
becoming more invisible and difficult to reach, com-
pounding the absence of their voices and narratives
in research.8,14,41 Failure to adequately engage with
TGGD individuals and communities may also increase
the risk of reporting inaccurate results; for example, ig-
norance of culturally specific TGGD language may
result in errors in sampling.33,34
IRBs might advise that researchers form and consult
with a community advisory board, consisting of a di-
verse TGGD membership, which ‘‘reflects the specific
communities at the center of the research question.’’8
Community-based participatory research models also
offer opportunities for mutually beneficial and trans-
formative collaborative partnerships between those
who fund, sponsor, and implement research, and the
groups, individuals, and communities affected by
it.42–44 These partnerships aid in the development of
surveys and interview questionnaires, provide an op-
portunity for marginalized voices to emerge, improve
access to and participant retention, and allow research-
ers to benefit from extensive TGGD in-group knowl-
edge.4,7,19,45–48 Regardless of these, all researchers will
benefit from spending personal time in the TGGD
community, both to foster familiarity and trust and
to be available to receive feedback and suggestions per-
sonally.5
The participation of TGGD-identified individuals in
the research team, particularly as principal or co-
investigators, also creates a number of unique chal-
lenges that should be directly addressed. Primary
among these are potential bias, blind spots, and inter-
personal factors.19,45 Dual relationships may be partic-
ularly difficult to avoid due to complex and extended
interpersonal, professional, and clinical networks link-
ing researchers, practitioners, clients, and TGGD com-
munities.4,19 However, provided they are neither sexual
Adams, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2017.0012
167
 nor exploitative, these relationships are not inherently
problematic and may even help to obtain access to
and build trust with participants.19,36 Insider research-
ers, in particular, may have fewer hurdles to overcome
mistrust between researchers and marginalized com-
munities and, thus, to effectively access and develop al-
liances with these populations.19,36,49
Nevertheless, dual relationships can cause problems;
for example, where research participants are concerned
about sharing highly personal information with those
in their social and community networks, they can in-
hibit disclosure. IRBs might, therefore, consider ad-
vising researchers to anticipate the need for diligent
supervision and diagramming plans for dealing with
these issues before they arise. Such plans might include
disclosing preexisting personal or professional relation-
ships between researchers and participants and assign-
ing interviews to individuals who do not have this
relationship.19 More generally, researchers should en-
gage in reflexivity (self-reflection and accountability)
and maintain an awareness of the potential for
power differentials and relationship dynamics between
participants and themselves, regardless of shared
experience.36,50
Language and framing of research
should be non-stigmatizing
IRBs should be aware, in scrutinizing proposals, that
linguistic choices may both support and oppose
TGGD stigma.4,5,13 Language that unnecessarily patho-
logizes or passes moral judgment can cause harm to
participants both during the research process and on
publication of findings.13,51 Bouman et al.35 discuss
this topic in detail, and some basic guidance on this
can be found in Appendix 1. We will outline here how
this relates to transgender health research, how IRBs
might best respond to this concern, and some additional
factors that they should keep in mind when approaching
this topic. Ultimately, however, the best way to ensure
the use of appropriate language in research with
TGGD individuals is through the involvement of com-
munity stakeholders (see Criterion ‘‘Whenever possible,
research should be grounded, from inception to dissem-
ination, in a meaningful collaboration with community
stakeholders’’).
TGGD identities and behavior should not be de-
scribed as necessarily pathological. It is, for example,
unhelpful for researchers to imply that TGGD ex-
periences are inextricably linked to ‘‘social and devel-
opmental problems,’’45 or to describe TGGD gender
identities as ‘‘‘extreme’, ‘persistent’, or ‘comorbid’’’13
with other conditions. Care should also be taken not
to de-gender, misgender, or contradict participants’ self-
identified gender, label it as inauthentic, or overemphasize
the gender that participants were designated at birth
(e.g., by describing someone as a biological, natal, or
normal woman or man).35,52,53
IRBs might respond to this by advising researchers
to include questionnaire and survey options that reflect
genders outside of the male/female binary, as in the
two-step method outlined in the discussion of Crite-
rion ‘‘The diversity of the transgender and gender di-
verse community should be accurately and sensitively
reflected’’ later.35,52,53 They might also advise that
gender-based comparisons be parallel; for example,
by comparing transgender men with cisgender men,
not with ‘‘normal’’ or ‘‘typical’’ women or men.4,35
There may be instances where comparison on the
basis of assigned sex is warranted in some biologically
focused research (e.g., research of cancer), but these
comparisons should be justified and discussed by
using sensitive language.35,54
IRBs should advise researchers to take care in fram-
ing their research in a manner that positively impacts
TGGD individuals and their community and mini-
mizes its potential utility for harm.4,5 Tannehill55 pro-
vides an excellent synopsis of how research has been
misused and misinterpreted in support of harmful pol-
icies and laws directed at TGGD individuals and com-
munities. Topics of particular risk include research on
suicidality and poor mental health outcomes,35,56 auto-
gynephilia,57 and the persistence of TGGD identities
from childhood into adulthood.58 Although researchers
working in these areas may not intend for their findings
to be used in a harmful manner, their work can, never-
theless, be employed to advance anti-TGGD dogma,
attack the provision of transgender healthcare, and in-
crease stigma. IRBs might advise that some researchers
have sought to mitigate and challenge the misuse of
their findings through collaboration with TGGD indi-
viduals and communities and by actively engaging
with the media to establish the intended interpretation
of their findings.55,59,60
Research should be disseminated
back to the community
The field of transgender healthcare has sometimes
appeared to prioritize research that is individually
and theoretically interesting over that which might
have concrete benefits for, be actively disseminated
Adams, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2017.0012
168
 to, or include TGGD communities.5,50 Well-designed
and accessible research can, however, be of immense
benefit to TGGD community organizations, health
professionals, and policy makers.15,20,37,44 IRBs should,
therefore, address the manner in which individual
projects plan to locate, write about, conceptualize, in-
terpret, and disseminate findings from extremely mar-
ginalized groups in a way that is meaningful to and
inclusive of these communities.5,43,61
Ideally, researchers will have identified a plan for
making their findings accessible to TGGD commu-
nities and non-academic healthcare professionals in
their IRB proposal. For instance, if they are applying
for a grant, they may have budgeted for open access
publication and dissemination of findings through dig-
ital and traditional media. IRBs might also encourage
researchers to include a provision in their proposal
that commits them to sharing their findings via alter-
native mediums that appeal to wider audiences, such
as community reports, online videos, blogs, and post-
cards.42,62–64
The diversity of the TGGD community
should be accurately and sensitively reflected
IRBs are advised to consider whether research propos-
als indicate an appropriate awareness of TGGD diver-
sity and culture. Researchers should be expected to
demonstrate that they are open to a process of reflex-
ive, ongoing learning, in recognition of the multiplic-
ity and fluidity of TGGD identities, experiences,
politics, and cultures.8,35,65 This is particularly impor-
tant for proposals that involve white/Western re-
searchers undertaking studies in the Global South
and/or with Indigenous/Two-Spirit populations.66
Such projects run the risk of erasing or rendering in-
visible traditional Indigenous concepts of gender, es-
pecially those that normalize forms of non-binary
gender expression,13,42,67 in favor of Western ones,
as in the term transgender.14,68
IRBs can test for an awareness of TGGD diversity
by, for example, scrutinizing the proposed methods
for obtaining information on gender identity. In
doing so, IRBs might notice a tendency to reflect the
gender identity of TGGD individuals as homoge-
nous,18 through a medical or disease-based lens,16,42,69
and in binary terms (e.g., either or neither male nor fe-
male).5,70 Though piloted and largely deployed in West-
ern research environments, the two-step method,71,72
which involves asking participants to (1) describe their
gender identity and (2) identify the sex they were
assigned at birth,73 has been successfully used in a vari-
ety of international contexts to accurately reflect the
diversity of TGGD gender identities.74 Further, this
method includes individuals who do not identify as
TGGD5 and can be adapted to incorporate non-binary
individuals through the addition of vectors such as
‘‘female-to-other’’ and ‘‘male-to-other’’ and/or by
allowing participants to select and write in multiple
gender options, including ‘‘X’’ or non-binary, simulta-
neously.75–77 In addition, some research has tended
to conflate intersex and TGGD participants48,78 and
IRBs may advise that researchers provide a definition
of these terms as a precursor to asking partici-
pants whether they fit them.79 ‘‘Intersex’’ should also
be selectable separately and in addition to gender
identity.62
Further methodological issues include the use of in-
struments that are validated with non-TGGD popula-
tions, presume participant heterosexuality,80 conflate
gender identity and sexual orientation,80 ask respon-
dents to comment on sexual acts they cannot perform
due to their genital configurations,7 or assume that all
TGGD individuals desire or require surgical interven-
tions.9,56,81 These biases may find expression in the
theories and framings underpinning research ques-
tions, sampling, instruments, and data analysis and
IRBs should seek to ensure that they are not reflected
in the proposals before them.4 For example, although
Internet samples are favored in accessing hidden pop-
ulations,42 this method is also strongly correlated
with overwhelmingly white and highly educated sam-
ples. In-person data collection, on the other hand,
tends to garner higher responses from individuals
who are rural, older, less educated, poor, and/or peo-
ple of color.42 Although not always possible, research-
ers should be supported in efforts to combine these
methods.
Finally, IRBs may need to remind researchers that,
where research is potentially distressing, they are
obliged to refer participants to culturally suitable crisis
and social services. These may include suicide crisis
hotlines, housing and shelters, employment programs,
behavioral and medical care, and other services that are
specific to the needs of local TGGD communities.
Unfortunately, many such resources may be culturally
inclusive in some aspects without meeting all the needs
of TGGD participants. This may even be the case with
services generally targeted at the LGBT community. In
addition, such services are often plentiful in some areas
and scarce in others. Examples of appropriate resources
Adams, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2017.0012
169
 include Trans Lifeline in North America and Switch-
board LGBT+ Helpline in the United Kingdom.
Researchers should collaborate with their local TGGD
community to identify others.
Informed consent must be meaningful,
without coercion or undue influence
IRBs are advised to ensure that robust informed con-
sent procedures are in place for TGGD research and
information on this process explicitly available to po-
tential participants. Unfortunately, it is not clear
whether informed consent is universally or consistently
applied in the field of transgender healthcare research,
particularly when this research originates in healthcare
settings that are also the only available source of tran-
sitional services.16,20 Consenting to participate in re-
search in these environments may involve providing
extraordinary levels of personal information and agree-
ing to unlimited follow-up, under the real or imagined
fear that refusal to consent could result in a denial of
healthcare services.16,20,36,82 Ultimately, properly in-
formed consent may not be possible if individuals per-
ceive that refusal to participate will jeopardize their
access to care.5,20
IRBs should ensure that researchers qualify the
barriers and limitations to consent inherent in their
research, clarify how participants can refuse to partic-
ipate or withdraw their consent at any time,4 and in-
form participants of the meaning and purpose of the
research. In the case of research conducted in a clinical
setting, it is particularly important to assure partici-
pants, both verbally and in all written communication
and consent forms, that any provision of transgender
healthcare is also available in a manner that is explicitly
independent of research participation.4,16 In all such
communication, care should also be given to such fac-
tors as literacy and familiarity with medical and aca-
demic terminology.4 Further, in designating a point
of contact for concerns or enquiries, an alternative
should be provided for individuals whose primary phy-
sician is named.
The protection of participant confidentiality
should be paramount
Though standard in most IRB protocols, IRBs should
take particular care in ensuring that researchers work-
ing with TGGD populations protect participant confi-
dentiality, as this research may involve the collection
of extremely sensitive data that could place participants
at serious personal risk.8 Particularly as, ‘‘for some
[TGGD] people, providing basic demographic infor-
mation [e.g., gender, race, zip code] is sufficient to
identity’’ them.8 Research on this topic must, therefore,
take the highest precautions to ensure and protect par-
ticipants’ privacy, confidentiality, and, unless otherwise
explicitly agreed on, anonymity. Anonymity can be
protected in a variety of fashions, such as employing
identification codes, retaining data in secure storage,
and/or letting participants create and remember their
own unique identifiers.4
IRBs might recommend the use of various other
tools for protecting participant anonymity, confiden-
tiality, and/or ensuring consent. For example, data col-
lection can occur online, via survey instruments hosted
on associated university servers and stored offline
under encryption, or it can be completed anonymously
on paper, with consent explicitly implied by filling out
and returning the survey.4 IRBs may also suggest that
researchers proactively guard against the risk of data
being requested in legal proceedings by seeking the
local equivalent of a United States Certificate of Confi-
dentiality from the U.S. Public Health Service.4 Finally,
recruitment registries, though invaluable,44 should al-
ways be opt-in only and employed cautiously, due to
the potential for privacy violations and misrepresen-
tation of the information collected. The data captured
in these registries are static, whereas individual iden-
tities, behaviors, and attractions are not.
IRBs should note that although it must never be
forced, there are circumstances in which participants
may want to eschew their anonymity. For instance,
some research focuses on critically examining publicly
available materials created by TGGD people, such as
blogs, news articles, and social media videos. It can,
in these cases, be appropriate to cite the authors of
these works so as to amplify voices and perspectives
that may otherwise be silenced or erased within re-
search contexts.15,36 More generally, anonymization
should be a process based on informed consent, rather
than a ‘‘one size fits all’’ approach.83,84
Alternative consent procedures
should be considered for TGGD minors
Parental or guardian consent has long been seen as an
absolute rule when conducting research with minors.85
However, IRBs are advised that, to avoid excluding or
pressuring youth who have not disclosed their gender
identity to their family, some researchers may employ
alternative approaches to consent with TGGD mi-
nors.8,86–88 IRBs should judge these approaches on
Adams, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2017.0012
170
 their merits and within the context of the particular
scenario. For instance, IRBs may see proposals that in-
voke mature minor research clauses,4,85,88 which have
been employed in both TGGD youth research and to
aid in building trust with youth frustrated with being
infantilized.85,88,89 Implementing these clauses may re-
quire a number of unique safeguards, such as the use
of independent advocates to assure participants’ rights.
Other researchers have used innovative approaches
to ensuring capacity to consent, as in Kuper’s90 use of
a four-item true–false questionnaire that tested com-
prehension of the informed consent document and
blocked survey participation until it was correctly
completed.
Research should align with current professional
standards that refute conversion, reorientation,
or reparative therapy
IRBs are advised to reject clinical research that entails
conversion,
reorientation,
or
reparative
therapy.
These approaches describe attempts to change an indi-
vidual’s sexual orientation or gender identity to align
with the sex they were assigned at birth and are increas-
ingly recognized as inherently unethical.91 A growing
body of literature is highly critical of this type of ther-
apy.67,91–96 In particular, therapies focused on encour-
aging TGGD children to develop into heterosexual
and/or cisgender adults have been shown to cause
significant distress and negative outcomes.18,67,97–99
Numerous professional bodies have echoed these con-
cerns by issuing statements advising against or prohib-
iting the practice of reparative therapy, including a
coalition of the United Kingdom’s professional orga-
nizations and public health bodies,100 the American
College of Physicians,101 the American Psychoanalytic
Association,102 and WPATH.103 Some jurisdictions have
also legislated against it.104,105 In addition, TGGD people
appear more likely to engage in research that takes a
gender affirmative approach, which affirms their gender
identity and seeks to optimize access to gender-affirming
care.106
IRBs should guard against the temptation
to avoid, limit, or delay research on this subject
IRBs may attempt to defensively avoid institutional in-
vestigations or external lawsuits by discouraging and/
or placing unnecessary restrictions on research in-
vestigating controversial topics.88 This may be a par-
ticular challenge in the case of research on TGGD
individuals, as this population is both extremely vul-
nerable to social stigma and currently the subject of
intense political and social debate. However, to ignore
this topic is to do a serious disservice to the individu-
als affected by it and deny them research needed to
improve their lives. Although some caution is justi-
fied, too much may result in obstructive processes,
lengthen the time taken to approve IRB applications,
discourage research into complex topics, and cause re-
searchers to avoid controversial issues and innovative
research.6,88 IRBs should, therefore, consider the risks
associated with not undertaking transgender health
research alongside those involved in undertaking
any given project.
Conclusion
This article outlines nine provisional criteria that can
be used to assess the ethical orientation of transgender
health research projects. Although they are primarily
intended to guide IRBs in assessing proposals before
them, they may also prove useful to editors and re-
viewers examining research undertaken with TGGD
participants, as well as individual researchers evaluat-
ing their own study designs. These criteria have been
developed by the authors through reviewing, adapting,
and summarizing the relevant literature on this topic.
We hope that they will serve as a useful starting point
for researchers considering these important issues,
rather than as an exhaustive list of ethical consider-
ations for research involving TGGD people. Although
we have attempted to include authors from a diverse
range of backgrounds in the creation of this article, we
know that a thorough and systematic consultation with
a variety of TGGD communities and individuals is
needed to further develop the guidelines presented here.3
We further hope that this article will draw attention
to the need for a section on ethical research standards
in future versions of the WPATH Standards of Care for
the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender
Nonconforming People. The Standards of Care provide
detailed and internationally relevant guidance for
healthcare practitioners working to support TGGD
people. Expanding their scope to include guidance on
research standards will encourage ethically and meth-
odologically rigorous research, particularly among cli-
nician researchers.

Appendix 1: Terms for Transgender Health Research
Cisgender
A ‘‘cis/cisgender/cisperson, [is] a person whose gender
identity is the same as the sex they were assigned at
birth.’’A1
Cisgenderism
The prioritization of non-transgender and gender
diverse (TGGD) identities as ‘‘healthy or ideal.
[This term] describes a prejudicial ideology.that is;
systemic, multi-level and reflected in authoritative cul-
tural discourses. [demonstrating] that such categori-
cal distinctions can themselves be’’ prejudicial.A2
Gender Identity
This term describes an individual’s internal sense of
themselves as male, female, both, neither, or some
other permutation. This is distinct from sex, which re-
fers to the physiological sex characteristics present in
an individual at their birth.
Gender Incongruence
Gender incongruence is the feeling, held by some
TGGD individuals, that one’s sex assigned at birth
and gender identity are misaligned. This feeling may
extend to a desire ‘‘to have been born the other sex,
or the desire to change sex.’’A3
Gender Diverse
This term may describe individuals who do not iden-
tify as completely male or female and who may use
descriptors such as non-binary, genderqueer, butch,
and/or transgender; individuals who express gender
nonconformity but do not necessarily ascribe to a
transgender identity; and/or individuals whose gender
identities do not align with either the female/male
binary or the white, Western cultural context of trans-
gender.
Intersex
Intersex is a term that encompasses a number of med-
ical conditions where an individual ‘‘is born with. re-
productive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t fit the
typical definitions of female or male.’’ This may mani-
fest as elements of male and female anatomy in a single
individual, or a potentially more invisible inconsistency
of chromosomal sex.A4
Adams, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2017.0012
174
 Transition
Transition is typically defined as the time when an in-
dividual begins to live as a new gender that is different
from the sex they were assigned at birth. This process
usually starts with changing one’s name and docu-
ments to reflect the new gender and may include hor-
mones and surgery to make the individual’s body more
closely match that of the gender to which they are tran-
sitioning.A5
Transgender
Depending on cultural and geographic context, trans-
gender may be seen as a gender identity that denotes
a desire to live in a gender role different from that
assigned at birth, and/or ‘‘an umbrella term which
includes transsexuals, cross dressers, intersex. per-
sons, gender variant persons and many [others that
may or may not have] . undergone any surgery or
physiological changes.’’A6
Transsexual
This term has historically described individuals who
feel that ‘‘their inner sense of being male or female
[fundamentally] conflicts. with [their] biological
sex. [These individuals] have taken or want to take
measures (surgery or hormones, etc.) to permanently
change their physical sex.’’A7 In recent years, it has be-
come more common for the term to be used by and for
individuals of any gender who have or intend to per-
manently transition socially and/or physically.
Two-Spirit/ed
This is ‘‘an umbrella term. [that is sometimes used
by] aboriginal individuals who live between socially
defined male and female gender roles.’’A8
