that can target therapeutics to pathologically 
exposed brain extracellular matrix

Diseases that lead to blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption will pathologically expose normally inaccessible brain 
extracellular matrix (ECM) to circulating blood components. Therefore, we hypothesized that brain ECM-targeting 
moieties could specifically target the disrupted BBB and potentially deliver therapies. Variable lymphocyte receptors 
(VLRs) that preferentially associate with brain ECM were identified from an immune VLR library via yeast surface 
display biopanning coupled with a moderate throughput ECM screen. Brain ECM binding of VLR clones to murine 
and human brain tissue sections was confirmed. After systemic administration, P1C10, the lead brain ECM-targeting 
VLR candidate, specifically accumulated in brains with mannitol-disrupted BBB and at disrupted BBB regions in 
two different intracranial glioblastoma models. We also demonstrate P1C10’s ability to deliver doxorubicin-loaded 
liposomes, leading to significantly improved survival in glioblastoma-bearing mice. Thus, VLRs can be used to 
selectively target pathologically exposed brain ECM and deliver drug payloads.
INTRODUCTION
Under healthy conditions, brain endothelial cells form the blood-
brain barrier (BBB) that differentially segregates blood components 
from the central nervous system (CNS) (1). Because of the BBB’s 
specialized barrier properties, including tight junctions and drug 
efflux transport, CNS uptake of systemically administered thera-
peutics is often limited (1, 2). However, multiple events including 
acute insults such as trauma and stroke, chronic pathologies such as 
tumors and multiple sclerosis, and artificial methods such as high- 
frequency focused ultrasound and osmotic agents can disrupt BBB 
integrity (1, 3–7). Although the time course, extent and location 
of BBB disruption markedly differ with each condition, the con-
sistent result is pathological exposure of normally sequestered brain 
extracellular matrix (ECM) (1, 2, 6, 8–10). Therefore, targeting 
brain regions with pathologically disrupted BBB could serve as a 
noncell-intrinsic method of delivering therapy to previously “difficult- 
to-access” CNS disease sites. This strategy is potentially superior to 
therapies directed against cell-intrinsic targets because normal brain 
ECM serves as the targeting ligand rather than cell-associated disease 
variants or markers that are often altered or lost after treatments, re-
sulting in therapeutic resistance (11). Moreover, a single ECM-targeting 
ligand could be applied to many different CNS diseases or conditions 
and provide a versatile therapeutic platform, contrasting to other 
recent ECM-targeted approaches that selectively target injury or 
disease- 
associated ECM (4, 12).
To test the potential benefits of ECM-targeted drug delivery, 
we first applied the concept to the incurable brain cancer, glio-
blastoma (GBM). Better GBM therapies are sorely needed because 
patients have a uniformly poor prognosis with median survival of 
less than 2 years despite aggressive clinical treatments of surgery, 
chemotherapy, and radiation (13, 14). Recent data indicate that 
GBM targeting of immunotherapy through interleukin-13 (IL-13)–
targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells could have 
marked effects for a short time in selected patients, and CAR T cells 
targeting chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 recently demonstrated 
efficacy in a murine model (11, 12, 15). Thus, targeting of GBM 
and, specifically, ECM components could offer new treatment 
strategies. In addition, central or internal GBM regions exhibit 
disrupted BBB revealed by magnetic resonance imaging enhance-
ment with gadolinium contrast, suggesting compatibility with 
ECM-targeted approaches (6, 16). Thus, we hypothesized that 
pathologically exposed brain ECM in GBM could be targeted for 
therapeutic purposes.
While standard peptides and antibodies could be used as ECM- 
targeting reagents, we chose to deploy lamprey antigen receptors 
known as variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) (17). VLRs are 
crescent-shaped, leucine-rich repeat proteins that recognize 
antigenic targets with specificity and affinity comparable to im-
munoglobulin (Ig)–based antibodies (1, 18, 19). Combining the 
unique binding site geometry with the approximately 500 million 
years of evolutionary distance between lamprey and mammals, 
VLRs could possibly recognize conserved proteins and glycans in 
ECM that may not be effectively targeted by mammalian anti-
bodies (17–19). To identify VLRs that bind brain ECM, we screened 
an immunized lamprey VLR library in yeast surface display 
format by biopanning. The resultant enriched pool of ECM- 
binding clones was subsequently assayed for preferential binding 
to brain ECM using a moderate throughput, enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA)–based screen. The lead clone 
demonstrated preferential accumulation at disrupted BBB sites in 
animals with osmotic BBB disruption or intracranial GBM tumors 
and also effectively targeted doxorubicin-loaded liposomes to im-
prove survival.

RESULTS
Identification of brain ECM-binding VLRs
Brain ECM-binding VLRs were identified by mining a yeast surface 
display library of VLRs. The library was generated from the VLR 
repertoire of lamprey immunized with mechanically isolated murine 
brain microvessel plasma membrane preparations that contained 
associated brain ECM (20). The library was first enriched for ECM 
binders via two rounds of biopanning on decellularized ECM generated 
by cultured mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3 cell line). Next, 
we sought to identify ECM-binding clones that preferentially bound 
bEnd.3 ECM compared to control mouse fibroblast ECM (3T3 cell 
line). For this analysis, we picked individual yeast clones into 96-well 
plates and then expanded and induced them for VLR display. To 
enable moderate throughput analysis of the clones and avoid cum-
bersome subcloning of many VLR clones, we removed the VLRs 
directly from yeast surface via reduction. After removal, we evaluated 
the comparative binding of VLRs to bEnd.3 and 3T3 ECM via ELISA 
screening (Fig. 1A). In total, 285 clones were assayed for differential 
binding, and observed binding signals were as high as ~5-fold prefer-
ence for bEnd.3 ECM (Fig. 1B). Ten clones demonstrated at least a 
2.5-fold preference for bEnd.3 ECM. To further validate the ELISA- 
based screening method, the individual VLR-displaying yeast clones 
were panned against both bEnd.3 and 3T3 ECM and imaged via 
bright-field microscopy. For example, yeast displaying clones P1C10 
and P2C7 (ELISA fold change, 4.2 and 4.5, respectively) bound selec-
tively to bEnd.3 ECM compared to 3T3 ECM, whereas a nonbinding 
VLR clone P1E9 showed very little ECM binding (Fig. 1C, P1E9).
Next, to confirm the in vivo relevance of ECM-binding VLR 
candidates, they were assayed for binding to murine brain sections. 
Eight of the top 10 VLR clones from the ELISA screen showed binding 
to murine brain sections (Fig. 1D). Two VLRs, including the P3E11 
clone shown in Fig. 1D, did not show brain tissue labeling despite 
their binding to cell culture ECM. Each of the binding clones 
demonstrated a diffuse parenchymal brain ECM immunolabeling 
pattern, with no apparent vascular or cell type enrichment despite 
the fact that brain endothelial cell ECM was used as the biopanning 
substrate. Given their positive binding and substantial bEnd.3 ECM 
selectivity in the ELISA assay, P1C10 and P3A8 were subjected to 
more detailed evaluation.
P1C10 displays brain-selective ECM binding
P1C10 and P3A8 were cloned into our previously described intein 
fusion yeast display system that allows site-specific modification of 
the VLR at the C terminus (21). In this way, P1C10 and P3A8 were 
functionalized with Cy5 fluorescent dye (22). Direct immunolabel-
ing of murine tissues using VLR-Cy5 conjugates indicated that 
P1C10-Cy5 had substantial brain ECM selectivity compared to kidney 
(10.1-fold increase), heart (20.2-fold increase), and liver (5.7-fold 
increase) tissues (Fig. 2A). In contrast, P3A8-Cy5 bound both brain 
and liver ECM with similar intensity but, like P1C10-Cy5, also did

bEnd.3 ECM. Next, individual clones were grown, induced, and screened for comparative binding to bEnd.3 and 3T3 ECM. VLRs were released from the yeast surface using 
reducing agent, and VLR binding to ECM was measured by probing the anti–c-myc epitope tag in an ELISA format. (B) Fold changes in ECM binding. The ratio of bEnd.3

not show binding to kidney and heart tissues (fig. S1). Next, we tested 
the ability of P1C10 to cross-react with human brain ECM using 
human brain cryosections. P1C10-Cy5 bound human brain ECM 
compared with controls, with a pattern similar to that observed in 
murine brain sections (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, P1C10-Cy5 also 
bound to ECM in cryosections of freshly resected human GBM 
specimens (Fig. 2C). Given the desirable attributes of brain selectivity 
and murine-human cross-reactivity, P1C10 affinity was measured 
and the monomeric dissociation constant (Kd) for binding to bEnd.3 
ECM was 48.38 ± 6.05 nM (Fig. 2D).
Brain ECM-binding VLR is retained within brain 
after BBB disruption
We next evaluated whether P1C10 would accumulate at sites of 
BBB disruption by using hyperosmolar mannitol for transient global 
BBB disruption in murine brain (23). P1C10 or RBC36 modified 
with IR800 near-infrared dye was administered intravenously at 
1 mg/kg to healthy C57BL/6 mice. RBC36 is a VLR that recognizes 
human H antigen trisaccharide (18) and was used as an isotype con-
trol. Next, mannitol was administered intravenously to transiently 
open the BBB. With the BBB still disrupted, mice were perfused to 
remove unbound VLR. We resected and imaged whole brains for 
retained IR800 signal (Fig. 3). Mice treated with P1C10-IR800 had a 
significant, 3.3-fold increase in accumulated brain fluorescence 
compared to RBC36-IR800 and a 7.6-fold increase compared to 
saline-treated animals. Thus, P1C10 selectively accumulates in nor-
mal brains after transient BBB disruption.
Brain ECM-binding VLRs selectively accumulate 
within intracranial GBM
We used two different intracranial GBM models to test the hypoth-
esis that pathological exposure of brain ECM can also be targeted by 
the identified VLRs. Intracranial implantation of murine GL261 or 
human U87 GBM cells results in brain tumors that exhibit chaotic 
vasculature and regional BBB disruption (24–26). First, P1C10 or 
RBC36 (1 mg/kg) isotype control (both modified with IR800 near- 
infrared dye) were intravenously administered to C57BL/6 mice 
bearing syngeneic, intracranial GL261 GBM. VLRs circulated for 
30 min before mice were perfused, brain resected, and imaged for 
IR800 signal. The mean fluorescence intensity of the GL261 tumor 
region for mice treated with P1C10-IR800 was 112-fold higher than 
that of the contralateral brain region (Fig. 4A). By contrast, the flu-
orescence intensity of the GL261 tumor region for mice treated with 
control RBC36-IR800 was only increased ninefold compared with 
contralateral brain. Moreover, the accumulated P1C10-IR800 in tu-
mor was 13-fold higher than that observed for control RBC36-IR800. 
Together, these data indicate that P1C10-IR800 selectively accumu-
lated within GL261 orthotopic tumors. Next, given the capability to 
target pathologically exposed ECM in mouse tumors, we also tested 
whether P1C10 could target ECM in orthotopically implanted human 
tumors. VLR uptake was monitored after VLRs were administered 
as above to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing 
intracranial U87 GBM tumors. In addition to P1C10, which exhibits 
diffuse binding to brain ECM, we also evaluated another VLR (192, 
identified in our laboratory), which binds much more selectively to

and liver vessels and ECM (fig. S2) (20). P1C10, 192, and RBC36 
were fused to a rabbit Fc region (VLR-Fc) to facilitate avidity and 
detection while minimizing renal clearance. VLR-Fc (3 mg/kg each) 
was administered intravenously and allowed to circulate for 30 min. 
After full-body perfusion, organs were removed, sectioned, and im-
aged for the presence of VLR-Fc. Both VLR clones P1C10-Fc and

being distributed throughout the tumor ECM (Fig. 4B). While 192-Fc

outside of large tumor vessels (Fig. 4B), recapitulating the perivas-
cular binding pattern observed in tissue section labeling assays. Nei-
ther VLR appreciably accumulated in the normal contralateral 
brain hemisphere from the same mouse, and isotype control 
RBC36-Fc was not found in tumor or normal brain regions 
(Fig. 4B). P1C10-Fc did not preferentially accumulate above back-
ground in treated mouse kidney, heart, or liver sections. In contrast, 
we found 192-Fc signal proximal to blood vessels of renal glomeruli 
and liver sinusoidal blood vessels (Fig. 4B). Quantitatively, P1C10-
Fc demonstrated a 21.2-fold increase in U87 tumor compared to 
contralateral controls, as well as increases of 21.2-fold compared 
to kidney, 15.9-fold compared to liver, and 29.6-fold compared to 
heart. Both P1C10-Fc (25.4-fold) and 192-Fc (11.9-fold) yielded 
increased accumulation in U87 tumor regions compared to the 
RBC36-Fc control. Both distributions mirrored those suggested by 
tissue section labeling (Fig. 2 and fig. S2). Together, both P1C10-Fc 
and 192-Fc specifically target and preferentially accumulate at 
regions of vascular disruption in GBM, with P1C10-Fc displaying 
more brain specificity.
VLRs can be conjugated to doxorubicin-loaded liposomes
Given the targeting specificity of P1C10, we wished to test the effec-
tiveness of ECM targeting for therapeutic delivery. Thus, we next 
used VLRs to decorate doxorubicin-loaded liposomes as a proof- 
of-
principle exploration of pathologically exposed ECM for therapeutic 
targeting in GBM. Doxorubicin was chosen as the test drug because 
it is easily visualized due to intrinsic fluorescence, there is abundant 
literature describing liposome loading and tumor targeting, and 
doxorubicin is a substrate for drug efflux transporters in cancer and at 
the BBB (24, 25, 27). Pegylated liposomes were loaded with doxorubicin 
as previously described (28). Resultant liposomes had a median 
diameter of 94.2 nm and contained doxorubicin (1 to 2 mg/ml; fig. S3). 
Next, we prepared VLR-intein fusion protein for attachment by install-
ing an azide group at the C terminus of the VLR as previously de-
scribed (fig. S3) (22). The azide-functionalized VLRs were next attached 
to the liposome surface by reacting with a strained cyclooctyne (DBCO) 
that was doped into the liposome formulation (DBCO-PEG2000-
DSPE). Specific VLR attachment was confirmed by measuring a 
significant increase in protein concentration in liposomal formu-
lations having the VLR-azide (fig. S3). Last, VLRs retained their 
binding activity after immobilization on the liposome surface as 
demonstrated by a 4.5-fold increase in doxorubicin signal for 
P1C10-targeted liposomes binding to murine brain sections com-
pared to RBC36-targeted control liposomes (Fig. 5). To demonstrate 
the feasibility of performing treatment studies with VLR-targeted 
doxorubicin-loaded liposomes, we incubated U87 GBM cells cul-
tured on bEnd.3 ECM with P1C10- or RBC36-targeted doxorubicin- 
loaded liposomes in vitro (Fig. 5). We observed an enhanced cell 
killing with P1C10-targeted liposomes with a median effective con-
centration (EC50) of 199.0 ± 1.7 nM compared with an EC50 of 
3312.0 ± 2.6 nM for RBC36-targeted liposomes.
P1C10-targeted liposomes significantly extend 
survival of GBM-bearing mice
To demonstrate the potential therapeutic utility of targeting patholog-
ically exposed brain ECM, we treated SCID mice bearing intracranial 
U87 GBM with P1C10-, 192-, or RBC36-targeted doxorubicin-loaded 
liposomes. For initial accumulation studies, tumor-bearing mice were 
administered one intraperitoneal dose of VLR-targeted doxorubicin 
liposomes, perfused, and then imaged for accumulated doxorubicin 
fluorescence. Whole-brain images of doxorubicin signal from mice 
treated with either P1C10- or RBC36-targeted doxorubicin liposomes 
show enhanced doxorubicin uptake with P1C10-targeted liposomes 
(Fig. 6, A and B). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of brain sec-
tions adjacent to sections used for fluorescent imaging demonstrates 
that the elevated doxorubicin signal was localized within tumor margins 
rather than contralateral normal brain. Higher-resolution fluorescent 
images indicate that P1C10 mediates an elevated doxorubicin accumulation

incubating with VLR-conjugated doxorubicin labeled liposomes, washing unbound liposomes, and then culturing for 72 hours at which point the cell viability was mea-
sured. All dilutions were performed in triplicate. EC50 for P1C10 = 199.0 ± 1.7 nM and RBC36 = 3312.0 ± 2.6 nM (P < 0.05, Student’s t test).

within the tumor region compared to control contralateral brain tissue 
(7.6-fold increase) or the signal observed within the tumor region after 
exposure to control RBC36 (7.9-fold increase) (Fig. 6, C to E). These 
data correlate with the VLR brain distribution data (Fig. 4), indicating 
that P1C10 mediates doxorubicin accumulation at the tumor site. To 
test therapeutic efficacy, we administered VLR-targeted liposomes to 
mice having detectable tumor burden 1 week after implantation (fig. S4). 
Four weekly therapeutic doses of 12 mg doxorubicin/kg of doxorubicin- 
loaded liposomes targeted by P1C10, 192, or RBC36 were administered 
by intraperitoneal injection at days 7, 14, 21, and 28. There were no 
significant differences in weight between groups (fig. S4C). Median 
survivals after tumor implantation were 43, 30, and 28 days for P1C10-, 
192-, and RBC36-targeted groups, respectively. The P1C10-targeted 
group demonstrated significantly improved survival compared to both 
the 192 and RBC36 control groups. Neither the 192 nor the RBC groups 
offered any survival benefit over a no- 
treatment control. These data 
indicate that targeting of pathologically exposed brain ECM with 
P1C10 can offer a therapeutic advantage versus perivascular targeting 
(192) or no targeting (RBC36).
DISCUSSION
This study presents an approach for identifying VLRs that accumu-
late in pathologically exposed brain ECM for therapeutic targeting 
of brain diseases. We used VLRs rather than conventional target-
ing molecules such as immunoglobulins, peptides, or DARPins 
(29–31). As described earlier, VLRs have a leucine repeat struc-
ture, are smaller than immunoglobulins, have a large evolutionary 
distance from mammals, and have additional propensity to bind 
glycostructures (17–19, 32). All four of these features are desirable 
for identifying targeting ligands that accumulate in brain ECM.
Whereas the unique structure and evolutionary distance expand 
the potential epitope range, the small size- and sugar-binding 
properties of VLRs could prove to be beneficial for accumulation 
and penetration into the tightly packed, glycosylated environment 
of brain ECM (27, 33). The novel, moderate throughput screening 
assay described in this study was suitable for identification of VLRs 
that specifically bind brain ECM. In particular, coupling an ECM 
biopanning protocol with a differential ECM-binding ELISA that 
simply used VLRs cleaved directly from the yeast surface enabled 
rapid identification of brain ECM-specific binders. In addition, 
the principles of this novel screening assay could be applied 
to identify targeting ligands that bind ECM derived from other 
organs or disease states.
Unlike typical therapeutic strategies that are designed to target 
disease-specific, cell-intrinsic markers (24), we show that targeting 
of pathologically exposed ECM could be effective in neurological 
diseases that exhibit differential BBB permeability such as GBM

(6, 8, 9). Another advantage is that there are available techniques to 
artificially expose sequestered ECM via local BBB disruption such 
as targeted high-frequency focused ultrasound. To our knowledge, 
only two other recent studies have suggested targeting ECM as a 
strategy to treat neurological diseases. The first study identified a 
peptide that homed to traumatic brain injury (TBI) injury sites and 
appeared to selectively bind brain ECM associated with the TBI in-
jury site (4). The second study generated CAR T cells targeted to 
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4, which is reportedly overex-
pressed in brain tumor ECM (12). Both studies rely on targeting 
diseased ECM and are therefore likely best suited for treating dis-
eases demonstrating these target-specific biomarkers. In contrast, 
the VLRs identified in our work bind normal brain ECM and strate-
gically use the pathological exposure of normal ECM for targeting 
specificity. This approach could therefore obviate the need to iden-
tify a disease-specific target, and the ECM-targeting VLRs could be 
customized for any neurological disease that exhibits BBB disruption 
(or via artificial BBB disruption) by simply altering the therapeutic 
payload. Last, the initial immunohistochemical and biodistribution 
analyses with VLR clone P1C10 demonstrated high brain ECM 
specificity compared to peripheral tissues, indicating that brain ECM 
can serve as a “specific” target when coupled with pathological dis-
ruption of BBB properties. Thus, this strategy represents a significant 
departure from existing platforms that focus on targeting disease- 
related cell-intrinsic markers and/or schemes to circumvent the BBB.
Specific targeting of BBB disruption could potentially reduce off- 
target effects compared with ligands that target overexpressed re-
ceptors as these proteins can also be expressed elsewhere in the body, 
although this would require further study.
This study used two different intracranial GBM murine models 
to demonstrate the functional relevance of targeting pathologically 
permeable BBB to deliver therapeutics. Implanting GL261 intracra-
nially into C57BL/6 mice is a widely used immunocompetent syn-
geneic mouse GBM model for immunotherapy-related studies (26). 
In addition, implantable human-derived U87 GBM is a commonly 
used preclinical model, although the specific patient origin is un-
clear (24, 25, 34). Benefits include that it is a human tumor, has 
controlled tumor initiation, and can be implanted intracranially in 
SCID mice. Previous studies have demonstrated that treating U87 
intracranial glioma with IL-13– or 2C5 nucleosome–recognizing, 
antibody-targeted, and doxorubicin-loaded liposomes significantly 
extended survival, with the IL-13 targeting leading to a partial cure 
(24, 25). Similarly, P1C10 targeting resulted in doxorubicin accu-
mulation within GBM xenografts, reduced in vitro EC50, and signifi-
cantly improved survival. In contrast to the IL-13 study, we observed 
no cured animals after doxorubicin treatment. However, the unopti-
mized doxorubicin dosing and administration in our study is differ-
ent from the previous IL-13 work, and IL-13 may also result in 
tumor cell endocytosis (35), which may confer superior efficacy 
compared to an ECM-targeted doxorubicin payload. We adminis-
tered all treatment groups in this study equal amounts of VLR- 
conjugated, doxorubicin-loaded liposomes. Thus, the therapeutic 
benefit observed with P1C10 VLR is directly related to its specific 
targeting of disrupted BBB regions, and the biodistribution data 
suggest that the therapeutic benefit results from enhanced accumu-
lation of doxorubicin selectively within the GBM. The survival benefit 
was only observed with P1C10, which displays diffuse parenchymal 
brain ECM binding, and not with the perivascular accumulating 
VLR 192. Additional studies comparing the P1C10 and 192 VLRs, 
as well as possible use of mass spectrometry or glycan arrays or other 
methods to identify the ECM antigenic components recognized by 
these VLRs, could offer insights into possible differences in thera-
peutic efficacy that may be based on actual delivered dose or differ-
ential localization.
Although GBM was used as a proof-of-concept neurological 
disease in this study since these tumors exhibit pathological BBB 
disruption and ECM exposure, it is important to note that recent 
studies demonstrate GBM tumors exhibit only partially disrupted 
BBB (6). The invasive tumor margins generally reside behind an 
intact BBB.Therefore, targeting pathologically permeabilized BBB 
with VLRs appears to be an effective strategy for delivering drug to 
the tumor core, but further work is needed to combine these VLRs 
with a therapeutic platform that is capable of spreading and inclu-
sively targeting the clinically important invasive margin. Alterna-
tively, techniques such as targeted high-frequency focused ultrasound 
or stereotactic radiation could further disrupt the BBB, potentially 
allowing brain ECM-binding VLRs to deliver therapeutics to the 
tumor margins. In addition, rather than targeting doxorubicin as 
in this proof- 
of-principle study, P1C10 VLR could be used to target 
and deliver more clinically relevant anti-GBM treatments such as 
temozolomide- 
loaded liposomes or immune checkpoint inhibi-
tors (36, 37). To gather evidence for broad application and versa-
tility of our approach, we envision extending our paradigm of 
delivering therapies via brain ECM targeting to additional disease 
models that show pathological exposure of brain ECM, including 
stroke, trauma, and neurodegenerative conditions. In addition, 
given the observed P1C10 accumulation after BBB disruption via 
hyperosmolar mannitol, it would be conceivable to use a combina-
tion of ECM-targeting VLRs and localized anatomical BBB dis-
ruption techniques such as high-frequency focused ultrasound to 
specifically target therapies to diseased brain regions that are asso-
ciated with an intact BBB (27, 38). Although relatively low VLR 
immunogenicity has been reported in recent murine studies, VLRs 
would likely require humanization for future clinical applications, 
potentially by grafting antigen-binding domains onto human pro-
teins that have a structurally homologous leucine repeat structure 
(39, 40). Last, with the potential of VLRs to target and deliver 
many different therapeutic payloads having various mechanisms 
of action, detailed toxicity testing for each VLR-payload combina-
tion will be necessary.
In conclusion, we present a proof-of-principle study for exploit-
ing the pathological exposure of brain ECM for therapeutic benefit. 
Identification of VLRs and other targeting reagents that can target 
the pathological exposure of brain ECM and be combined with 
compatible therapeutic payloads may provide a new approach for 
treating many debilitating neurological diseases that currently lack 
effective treatments, including incurable GBM.

guidelines.
Data inclusion/exclusion criteria
Data generated for all assays were presented.
Outliers
No outliers were removed in this study.
Selection of endpoints
Study endpoints were predefined on the basis of the assay (please see 
methods sections below) and were not changed on the basis of outcomes.
Replicates
All in vitro assays were performed in multiple replicates as de-
scribed within the methods section. Murine studies were powered 
as described below to measure statistically significant differences 
between groups.
Research objectives
The overall goal of this proof-of-concept study was to identify VLRs 
that bind normal brain ECM and demonstrate the functional ability 
of these VLRs to treat neurological pathologies that present with 
pathologic exposure of brain ECM.
Research subjects or units of investigation
NOD-SCID and C57BL/6 mice, bEnd.3 and 3T3 tissue-cultured 
cells, U87 and GL261 GBM cell lines, murine tissue sections (multiple 
organs), human brain sections, and human GBM sections were 
used in this study.
Experimental design
This study was a controlled laboratory experiment. Initial measure-
ments were made using quantitative ELISA-based assays. Clones 
were validated using qualitative and quantitative in vitro assays and 
qualitative and quantitative murine studies.
Randomization
Mice were randomized into groups after intracranial implantation 
of U87 or GL261 GBM cells.
Blinding
Researchers were not blinded in this study given the limited num-
ber of individuals approved to perform murine assays making 
blinding impractical for this proof-of-concept study.
Cell culture
bEnd.3 cells [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-2299)] 
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM):F12 
(1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). NIH/3T3 cells 
(ATCC CRL-1658) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% 
FBS. Cultures were decellularized to expose ECM using nonenzymatic 
cell removal techniques. Namely, versene treatment (three washes at 
37°C for 10 min each) or three 10-min washes with 10 mM tris, 10 mM 
EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 at 4°C, followed by 30-min incubation 
with deoxyribonuclease (0.2 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS) with calcium and magnesium were used for decellularization 
(4, 41). Following decellularization, all plates were stored for a maxi-
mum of 6 months at 4°C in PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
until use. U87-MG (ATCC HTB-14) cells were grown in DMEM sup-
plemented with 10% FBS and passaged using accutase.
Yeast culture
For VLR surface display assays, EBY100 yeast were grown in SD-CAA 
medium [dextrose (20.0 g/liter), yeast nitrogen base (6.7 g/liter), 
casamino acids (5.0 g/liter), Na2HPO4·7 H2O (10.19 g/liter), and 
NaH2HPO4·H2O (8.56 g/liter)] as previously described and induced 
when the culture reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD600nm) 
between 0.8 and 0.9 using SG-CAA medium (21). Yeast was in-
duced for 48 hours at room temperature before VLR or VLR- 
intein 
was harvested. For VLR secretion, YVH10 yeast transformed with 
pRS316–VLR-intein was grown in SD-2XSCAA + Trp [dextrose 
(20 g/liter), yeast nitrogenous base (6.7 g/liter), Na2HPO4·7H2O 
(10.19 g/liter), NaH2HPO4·H2O (8.56 g/liter), Arg (190 mg/liter), 
Met (108 mg/liter), Tyr (52 mg/liter), Ile (290 mg/liter), Lys (440 mg/liter), 
Phe (200 mg/liter), Glu (1260 mg/liter), Asp (400 mg/liter), Val (480 mg/
liter), Thr (220 mg/liter), Gly (130 mg/liter), and Trp (40 mg/liter), 
lacking leucine and uracil]. Cultures were initiated, and then, cell density 
reset the following day to an OD600nm = 0.1 and grown for 72 hours at 
30°C. Yeast were induced by replacing the medium with an equivalent 
volume of SG-2XSCAA + Trp [galactose replacing dextrose (20 g/liter)] 
containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA and culturing the cells for 72 hours at 
20°C. Yeast supernants were harvested, filtered through 0.22-m PES 
(polyethersulfone) membranes, and dialyzed against tris-buffered 
saline (TBS) [25 mM tris, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl (pH 7.9)]. Imidazole 
(5 mM) plus 200 ml of the dialyzed supernant was gently mixed 
overnight at 4°C with 1 ml of cobalt HisPur resin (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Beads were collected, washed with TBS plus 10 mM im-
idazole, and eluted with TBS plus 250 mM imidazole. Elutants were 
then buffer- 
exchanged into 50 mM HEPES [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1- 
piperazineethanesulfonic acid] (pH 7.2) (removing the imidazole 
and neutralizing pH) using 10 K MWCO (10 kDa molecular weight 
cut-off) filters. Of note, regenerated cellulose membranes contain high 
amounts of thiols that induce nondesirable intein cleavage during 
isolation. We recommend using a PES membrane available through 
Pierce and Pall for buffer exchanges with secreted VLR- 
intein fusions 
before expressed protein ligation (EPL).
Combining biopanning with moderate throughput 
ELISA-based screen
The VLR YSD library underwent two rounds of biopanning against 
bEnd.3 ECM to enrich for brain ECM-binding clones as previously 
described (20, 42). For the ELISA-based screen, selected biopanning 
clones were streaked out, and individual clones were picked into 96-
well polypropylene plates. Clones were expanded at 30°C overnight in 
SD-CAA medium and split into two plates (one plate for screening and one 
plate for frozen stock). The screening plate was induced at 20°C using 
SG-CAA medium for 24 hours. VLR displaying yeast were washed 
with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), and VLR was reduced off of the yeast 
surface using 20 l of 50 mM MESNA solution in 50 mM HEPES 
(pH 7.2) for 45 min. Supernatants containing VLR were then diluted 
1:10 with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2). Plates containing decellularized bEnd.3 
or 3T3 ECM were blocked with 1% BSA and 1.5% goat serum in PBS 
and incubated with the HEPES-diluted VLRs for 1 hour at 37°C. Wells 
were washed five times with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20. Next, an anti-myc 
antibody (9E10, BioLegend) modified with horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP) (1:1000) was added to each well and incubated for 45 min at room 
temperature. Wells were then washed seven times with PBS + 0.05% 
Tween 20, 1 min per wash. VLR binding was detected by incubation 
with one-step 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate for 15 to 
30 min to develop signal. The reaction was stopped via acidification 
with 1 M HCl and quantified using absorbance signal at 450 nm. A 
blank well was included on every plate to establish background signal.
Affinity measurement
To characterize VLR affinity for bEnd.3 ECM, dilutions of purified 
VLR were incubated with ECM. P1C10 VLR was diluted using a

sixfold dilution scheme from 10 M to 0.21 nM and then incubated 
with bEnd.3 ECM. Wells were washed five times with PBS + 0.05%

and goat anti-mouse IgG modified with HRP. Wells were washed 
seven times with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with 
TMB substrate. Reaction was stopped after 15 min by acidification 
with 1 M HCl. Absorbance at 450 nm was quantified, and data were

viously described (43). The amino acid sequence for VLR P1C10 is

Manufacturing Cys-PEG3-azide EPL handle
Two hundred µM equivalents of Fmoc-Cys (SASRINTM resin)–OH 
(Bachem) were swollen in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) using two 
30-min washes. Azido-PEG3-amine (1 mM; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), dis-
solved in DMF, was added, followed by NMM (4-N-methyl-morpholine) 
and HCTU [2-(6-Chloro-1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′- 
tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate] for the activation of the 
amine. The reaction proceeded for 3 hours at room temperature. Resin 
was then washed nine times with DMF, two times with 20% piperidine 
for 15 min per wash, six times with DMF, and nine times with dichloro-
methane, dried for 10 min under N2, and transferred to a desiccator over-
night. The peptide was cleaved off the resin using 94% trifluoroacetic acid 
(TFA) with 2% TIPs (triisopropylsilane) for 3 hours. TFA was evaporat-
ed, and the peptide precipitated with cold ether. The Cys-PEG3-azide 
peptide sequence was confirmed with mass spectrometry (fig. S5) and 
purified to >90% using high-performance liquid chromatography.
Intein EPL
To facilitate intein-mediated EPL of yeast-displayed VLRs, VLRs were 
cloned into the pCTre vector and fused to the engineered 202-08 intein 
using previously described methods (21, 22). For surface display experi-
ments, 50 ml of yeast displaying VLR-intein fusion were pelleted, washed 
twice with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), and then incubated with 200 mM 
MESNA in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) (900 l). This procedure reduces 
VLRs off the yeast surface and triggers the intein to form an unstable 
thioester. Immediately following MESNA addition, 5 mM 2mer peptide 
containing N-terminal cys and styrene handle was added to the yeast 
slurry (final volume, 1000 l) (22). The mixture was incubated for 
45 min at room temperature, and then, the yeast was pelleted. The 
supernatant was recovered and incubated at room temperature with 
shaking for an additional 2 to 18 hours to facilitate EPL. Buffer exchange 
of the VLR solution against PBS using 10 kDa MWCO filters removed 
MESNA and excess EPL ligand. Last, the tetrazine-Cy5 was incubated 
with VLR-styrene to facilitate covalent C-terminal modification of VLR 
and create VLR-Cy5 fusions. For secretion of intein-VLR fusions, VLRs 
were instead cloned into the pRS316 vector and fused to the 202-08 in-
tein and produced and purified as noted in “Yeast culture” section 
above. Next, 200 mM MESNA was added to purified VLR-intein, fol-
lowed by the addition of 5 mM Cys-PEG3-azide to produce VLR-azide 
fusions for liposome attachment. The mixture was incubated overnight 
at room temperature with gentle shaking. MESNA and excess EPL li-
gand were removed before use by buffer exchange with 10 kDa MWCO 
filters as described above. Western blots were used to characterize VLR-
azide production. VLR samples were resolved on 4 to 12% bis-tris acryl-
amide and transferred to nitrocellulose using manufactures’ protocols. 
Blots were probed using anti-FLAG antibody (M1 murine monoclonal, 
Sigma) to detect the N-terminal FLAG tag.
VLR-IR800 fusions
VLR-IR800 was generated by creating VLR-azide using the intein- 
EPL 
reaction described above. After buffer exchange to remove MESNA and 
excess Cys-PEG3-azide, 5 mM DBCO-IR800 (LI-COR) was added to 
VLR fraction. Protein was shaken at 250 rpm, 30°C for 90 min, to facili-
tate the bioorthogonal azide-DBCO reaction and yield VLR-IR800. For 
GL261 imaging experiments, VLR-IR800 (1 mg/kg ) was intravenously 
administered to mice and allowed to circulate for 30 min before mice 
were perfused via cardiac puncture. Brains were resected, fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde, bisected, and imaged using a LiCor scanner. Serial 
sections were cut and stained with H&E to identify the tumor margins. 
n = 3 per group was generated over two independent experimental days.
Mannitol administration for temporary BBB disruption
Mannitol disruption was performed as previously described (23) with 
slight modification for this study. Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were anesthe-
tized and then intravenously administered VLR-IR800 (1 mg/kg). Five 
minutes after injection, 200 l of 25% mannitol solution in water was 
administered intravenously (~2 mg/g mannitol). Exactly 9 min after 
mannitol administration, while the BBB was still permeable (23), mice were 
perfused with 20 ml of PBS via cardiac puncture. Brains were removed 
and imaged for retained IR800 signal using a LiCor scanner. n = 3 
per group was generated over two independent experimental days.
VLR rabbit Fc fusions
VLRs were cloned into a pIRES vector and fused to rabbit Fc region 
(VLR-Fc). 293F cells (Life Technologies) were transfected with 
pIRES-VLR-Fc expression plasmids using 293fectin (Life Tech-
nologies), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfected 
293F cells were grown for 3 days in FreeStyle (Life Technologies) 
media. VLR-Fc dimers were purified using protein A/G beads accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol (Pierce).
Fluorescence microscopy of murine specimens
Murine immunoflourescence techniques were used in two formats. 
First, VLRs directly reduced off of yeast surface were reoxidized and in-
cubated with murine tissue sections, snap-frozen, and cut on a cryostat 
for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were washed three times with 
PBS + 1% BSA, 1.5% goat serum and incubated with a master mix con-
taining anti–c-myc (rabbit) antibody (1:500; BioLegend), goat anti-rabbit 
AF555 antibody (1:1000; Life Technologies), and Isolectin GS-IB4 
AF488 (1:400; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at room temperature. 
Sections were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (1:800) for the final 15 min 
of labeling. Sections were washed three times, fixed with 4% paraformal-
dehyde, and mounted for imaging. The second application was identical 
to the first except VLRs are directly labeled with Cy5 using intein EPL 
described above (22). Images were collected on a Zeiss Imager Z2 up-
right fluorescent microscope. For quantification, a minimum of three 
fields per group were quantified to determine VLR channel mean pixel 
intensity using ImageJ. Data are presented as mean pixel intensity ± SD.
Fluorescence microscopy of human specimens
Human brain samples were obtained from surgical resections as 
approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board. 
Samples were snap-frozen and sectioned on a cryostat. For VLR stain-
ing, VLR-Cy5 was incubated with human brain sections (1:100; 1 mg/ml)

for 1 hour at 37°C. Anti-CD31 (1:100; Cell Sciences) and goat anti- 
mouse AF488 (1:200; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to illu-
minate microvessels. Last, nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 
(1:800). All human sections were imaged using a Leica SP8 3X 
STED microscope using confocal settings.
Generation and characterization of VLR-targeted 
doxorubicin-loaded liposomes
Doxorubicin containing stealth liposomes decorated with VLR were 
produced. A lipid film containing 65% phosphatidylcholine, 32% 
cholesterol, 2.5% phosphatidylethanolamine-PEG2000, and 0.64% 
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[dibenzo-
cyclooctyl(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000-DBCO) (all 
lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids) was created by dissolving lipids 
in 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol and removing solvent as 
previously described (28). Films were rehydrated in 155 mM (NH4)2SO4 
(pH 5.5) via vortexing and heating to >65°C, sonicated for 1 hour, 
and extruded through double-stacked 100-nm filters. Liposomes 
were buffer-exchanged into 123 mM Na citrate using PD-10 desalt-
ing columns and immediately mixed with 30 mg of doxorubicin/100 
mg of lipid, at >65°C, to facilitate postformation loading. After ~1 hour 
at >65°C, liposomes were transferred to 4°C overnight. The next day, 
free doxorubicin was removed using PD-10 desalting columns. For-
mation and size of liposomes were confirmed using dynamic light scat-
tering (Malvern Zetasizer). To facilitate VLR decoration, VLR-azide 
was incubated with DBCO- 
containing liposomes for 90 min at 30°C 
with shaking. VLR covalently bound to the liposome surface was de-
tected by BCA (bicinchoninic acid assay) in nondoxorubicin-loaded 
liposomes (because doxorubicin contains a free amine) using the 
manufacturer’s protocol (Pierce). Encapsulated doxorubicin was 
quantified by boiling liposomes with 1% Triton X-100 and measuring 
doxorubicin absorbance at 480 nm compared to a standard curve.
In vitro U87 cytotoxicity assay
bEnd.3 cells were grown to confluence in 96-well plates. Wells were 
decellularized to leave bEnd.3 ECM, as described above. Next, 1000 U87 
cells per well were replated onto the U87 ECM and allowed to attach 
overnight. Wells were washed once with Opti-MEM and then incubated 
with a dilution series of P1C10- or RBC36-targeted doxorubicin- 
loaded liposomes. Liposomes were applied to the cell-ECM mixture 
in a dilution series from 80 M to 0.3 nM, using fourfold dilutions 
(concentration calculated from doxorubicin 480-nm absorbance 
signal), using Opti-MEM as a diluent and incubated for 2 hours. Wells 
were washed two times with complete media and incubated for an 
additional 72 hours. CellTiter-Glo (Promega) was used to quantify 
the number of live cells, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. EC50 
calculations were made using GraphPad software suite. To directly 
quantify VLR-doxorubicin binding to murine sections, P1C10-RBC36, 
or nontargeted doxorubicin-loaded liposomes were incubated with 
murine sections, washed and then imaged on a Zeiss Imager Z2 up-
right fluorescent microscope. A minimum of three fields per group 
were quantified to determine the VLR channel mean pixel intensity 
using ImageJ. Data are presented as mean pixel intensity ± SD.
U87 delivery and survival studies
All animal studies were approved by IACUC at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison. Nonobese diabetic–severe combined immuno-
deficient mice underwent intracranial implantation of U87 cells ex-
pressing luciferase as previously described (44). Tumor engraftment 
was determined by quantifying luminescence using luciferin and an 
IVIS imager, according to manufacturer’s protocols. For accumula-
tion studies, tumors were grown until mice demonstrated tumor 
burden by displaying neurologic symptoms or hunched posture. 
For VLR-Fc studies, protein (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 
and allowed to circulate for 30 min. Mice were then perfused, and 
the organs were harvested. Organs were snap-frozen, embedded in 
OCT (optimal cutting temperature), and cut using a cryostat. Sections 
were stained with Isolectin GS-IB4 (1:400), Hoechst 33342 (1:800), and 
goat anti-rabbit AF555 (1:500) and then imaged on an upright Zeiss 
Imager Z2 fluorescent microscope. For doxorubicin accumulation 
studies, mice bearing U87 intracranial tumors received a single injection 
of P1C10- or RBC36-targeted doxorubicin-loaded liposomes intra-
peritoneally (12 mg doxorubicin/kg). Drug was allowed to circulate for 
30 min, and then, mice were perfused with PBS and euthanized. 
Whole brains were bisected at the tumor site, and coronal images for 
doxorubicin fluorescence were taken using an IVIS imager (excitation, 
465 nm; emission, 600 nm). Slices adjacent to the brain bisection 
used to expose the tumor were stained with H&E to define tumor 
margins and Isolectin GS-IB4 + Hoechst 33342 (1:400 and 1:800, 
respectively) for imaging on an upright Zeiss Imager Z2 fluorescent 
microscope. A minimum of three fields per group were quantified 
to determine the VLR channel mean pixel intensity using ImageJ.
Data are presented as mean pixel intensity ± SD. For survival stud-
ies, after confirming tumor engraftment by luminescence, mice 
were intraperitoneally administered 12 mg/kg doxorubicin of 
P1C10-targeted (n = 5), 192-targeted (n = 5), or RBC36-targeted 
(n = 4) doxorubicin-loaded liposomes weekly for four cycles. Mice 
were monitored for neurological symptoms, hunched posture, and 
weight loss throughout the study and euthanized in accordance 
with guidelines of the IACUC protocol. The proportion of surviving 
mice over time was plotted using a Kaplan-Meier plot, and statisti-
cally significant differences were determined with log-rank tests.
Statistical analysis
Statistical methods used in each assay are defined in detail within 
each respective figure legend. In general, data are presented and 
means ± SD. The number of replicates used to generate these data is 
described in each method section. For murine survival studies, an n 
of 5 was chosen to power the study to observe a 30% survival differ-
ence between groups with 95% confidence.
