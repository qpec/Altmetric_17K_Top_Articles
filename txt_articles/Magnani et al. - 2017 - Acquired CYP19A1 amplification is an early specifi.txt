 Tumor evolution is shaped by many variables, potentially involving external selective pressures 
induced by therapies1. After surgery, estrogen receptor (ERα) positive breast cancer (BCa) 
patients are treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy2 including selective estrogen receptor 
modulators (SERMs) and/or aromatase inhibitors (AIs)3. However, over 20% of patients relapse 
within 10 years and eventually progress to incurable metastatic disease4. Here we demonstrate that 
the choice of therapy has a fundamental influence on the genetic landscape of relapsed diseases: in 
this study, 21.5% of AI-treated, relapsed patients had acquired CYP19A1 gene (aromatase) 
amplification (CYP19A1amp). Relapsed patients also developed numerous mutations targeting key 
breast cancer genes including ESR1 and CYP19A1. Strikingly, CYP19A1amp cells also emerge in 
vitro but only in AI resistant models. CYP19A1 amplification causes increased aromatase activity 
and estrogen-independent ERα binding to target genes resulting in CYP19A1amp cells displaying 
decreased sensitivity to AI treatment. Collectively these data suggest that AI treatment itself 
selects for acquired CYP19A1 amplification and promotes local autocrine estrogen signalling in 
AI resistant metastatic patients.
ERα activation characterizes over 70% of BCa where it represents the key prognostic factor 
and therapeutic target5. ERα activation is primarily dependent on circulating estrogens and 
results in genome-wide chromatin binding at thousands of regulatory regions6. ERα binding 
leads to the transcription of hundreds of genes central to BCa growth6. Endocrine therapies 
including SERMs and AIs were developed to prevent ERα activation and block BCa 
growth5. The mechanisms behind drug resistance are only partially understood and often 
involve transcriptional activation of alternative survival pathways, especially at later stages 
of the disease7. Nonetheless, recent genomic studies highlight how ERα signalling might 
still play a role in metastatic disease. For example, activating somatic mutations targeting 
ESR1 (the gene encoding ERα) are found at higher frequencies after endocrine therapy8,9. 
These mutations have been characterized in metastatic lesions from patients that received 
several cycles of ET and chemotherapy10,11, suggesting that the selective pressure imposed 
by endocrine treatments might favour the development of focused genetic aberrations during 
tumour evolution11. It is however impossible to infer from most studies when genetic 
aberrations originate and how these are selected, since patients are biopsied after multiple 
treatments. While the SERM Tamoxifen (TAM) directly blocks ERα co-activation in the 
tumor cell, AI targets CYP19A1 (aromatase) in the peripheral tissue thereby lowering 
estrogen availability. We recently reported that ERα positive BCa cells activate alternative 
epigenetic programs in response to TAM or AI12 suggesting that choice of endocrine 
therapies might contribute to tumor evolution. Here we examine, in parallel and for the first 
time, a cohort of estrogen receptor positive α patients who were treated with single agent 
adjuvant endocrine therapies (either TAM or non-steroidal AI) and re-biopsied whenever 
they had their first distal relapse (Fig 1A and Supplementary Figures S1-2).
We initially assessed copy number alterations (CNAs) of the genes encoding the targets of 
AI and TAM (CYP19A1:15q21 and ESR1:6q25 respectively) considering the central role of 
copy number changes in breast cancer13. Meta-analysis of previously published data from 
primary, treatment-naive patients using GISTIC-based14 cBioPortal15 shows that CYP19A1 
and ESR1 CNAs are exceedingly rare in ERα positive primary BCa (0.006%, 2/321 for 
CYP19A1 and 0.018%, 6/321 for ESR1 in ERα positive primary BCa, The Cancer Genome

 Atlas (TCGA) CNAs data 16, threshold: 1.5 fold change). Using an independent database of 
SNP-array based studies with an alternative CNAs algorithm17 confirms the rarity of 
CYP19A1 amplification events (Supplementary table 1). CYP19A1 and ESR1 amplification 
are also rare in other primary cancers (Supplementary Figures S3A-B and Supplementary 
table 1). These data demonstrate that CYP19A1 and ESR1 loci are not re-arrangement 
hotspots in untreated primary cancers. We then analyzed our discovery cohort consisting of 
tumor samples collected from the first relapse after single therapy using a TaqMan CNA 
assay comparing metastatic with matched normal breast tissue. Strikingly, we find that the 
CYP19A1 locus is amplified (CYP19A1amp) in 6/37 (16%) of the patients that received AI 
(CYP19A1amp). Conversely, only one patient (3%) that received TAM has evidence for 
CYP19A1 amplification (Fig. 1A). The ESR1 locus is also significantly amplified in 
relapsed material (24% and 13%, AI and TAM-treated cohorts respectively, Fig. 1A). To 
confirm these data, we then investigated an independent validation cohort with similar 
clinical characteristics. In agreement with the discovery cohort, we find that CYP19A1 is 
amplified in 6/19 (32%) of AI treated patients and only 1/19 (5%) of TAM-treated patients 
(Fig. 1B). ESR1 is amplified in 4/19 (21%) of AI treated and 0/19 of the Tamoxifen-treated 
relapses (Supplementary Figure S4A). The CYP19A1 locus shows evidence for both focal 
and chromosome-wide amplification (Supplementary Figure S5A). CYP19A1 and ESR1 
CNAs might work cooperatively considering the rate of co-amplification in AI treated 
patients (8/12 CYP19A1amp patients also carry ESR1amp, Supplementary Figure S5B). 
Notably, we could identify CYP19A1 and ESR1 amplification also in patient-derived 
xenografts (PDXs) obtained from patients previously treated with non-steroidal AI (Fig. 1C 
and Supplementary Figure S4B). Collectively these data show that treatment with reversible 
AI significantly increase the frequency of CYP19A1 amplification at first distal relapse 
(21.5% vs 4%, AI vs. Tamoxifen, P= 0.009, P=0.004 including PDXs, two-tailed Fisher’s 
Exact test). Similarly, we observe a trend for AI treated patients to preferentially amplify the 
ESR1 locus (23% vs 8%, AI vs. Tamoxifen P= 0.06, P=0.03 including PDXs, two-tailed 
Fisher’s Exact test). CYP19A/ESR1 amplification in distal relapses from AI resistant BCa is 
strongly reminiscent of Androgen Receptor amplification in castration resistant prostate 
cancer patients18,19.
We next designed a DNA-FISH assay to validate CYP19A1 amplification, and to investigate 
its degree of heterogeneity. We examined 4 cases found to be amplified by TaqMan: all of 
them present strong evidence for cluster amplification (Fig. 2A-B). FISH analysis also 
confirm 100% of TaqMan calls in the validation dataset (Supplementary figure S6). Over 
90% of nuclei from each of the metastatic samples examined by FISH has CYP19A1 
amplification signals, indicating that CYP19A1amp cells represent the dominant clone. 
Additionally, the 15α Satellite/CYP19A1 ratio strongly suggests that CYP19A1 
amplification is not a consequence of unspecific aneuploidy (Fig. 2B). Using DNA-FISH we 
could not find convincing evidence of CYP19A1 amplification in the respective primary 
samples (Fig. 2A, see online methods). Therefore, these results support the notion that 
CYP19A1 amplification occurs under treatment, although we cannot exclude the presence of 
very small CYP19A1amp subclones at diagnosis.
We then investigated the frequency of metastatic-specific ERα activating mutations11 and 
other commonly occurring mutations13,20 (at PIK3CA, MAPK, TP53 and GATA3 genes) in 
Magnani et al.

 AI or TAM treated distal relapses compared to matched normal germline DNA using an 
AmpliSeq Custom panel for targeted sequencing (Supplementary Table 2, see online 
methods). Overall, we found similar patterns of mutations between the two cohorts (Fig. 2C 
and Extended Data 1-2). These patterns however are potentially different from the ones 
previously characterized in primary BCa (Supplementary Figure S7). For example, we could 
identify several novel ERα mutations including the predicted activating mutations 
pLeu536His21 (TAM 19T), pMet543Ala22 (AI 28T and AI 46T) pAsp538Ala (TAM 10T) 
and p.Arg503Gln (AI 28T and AI 39T) (Fig 2C-D and Extended Datasets 1-2) in addition to 
the common p.Tyr537Ser (AI 36T). These mutations occur at relatively higher allele 
frequencies and can be polyclonal (AI 28T) (Fig S8A). In addition, we could identify several 
truncating TP53 mutations (examples: p.Arg213*, AI 8T; p.Cys242*, AI 13T and p.Glu294* 
TAM 23T; Fig 2C-D and Extended Datasets 1-2). Most of these mutations were confirmed 
by a second assay (Supplementary figure S8B). Interestingly, we designed probes against 
CYP19A1 and identified the novel recurrent mutation pPro410Ser/Leu (AI 5T and 18T, 
Supplementary figure S8B and Extended Datasets 2). This mutation is mutually exclusive 
with CYP19A1 amplification further suggesting its functional significance (Supplementary 
Figure S8B). Interestingly, p.Pro410 might be involved in the formation of a functional 
channel23. Collectively, these data demonstrate that several metastatic-specific mutations 
might play a role early on during tumor progression.
In post-menopausal women, AI target the peripheral conversion of testosterone/
androstenedione to estrogens by inhibiting the product of the CYP19A1 gene, the aromatase 
enzyme. Cholesterol is the common precursor of sex hormones including testosterone and 
androstenedione, the two substrates of the aromatase enzyme24. In vitro, AI resistant cells 
develop de novo cholesterol biosynthesis via epigenetic events to promote autonomous ERα 
activation12. Interestingly, current treatment protocols can effectively remove all estradiol 
from serum used in culture, while they are far less efficient in removing testosterone25. 
Thus, we hypothesized that CYP19A1 amplification might favour autocrine estrogens 
production starting from epigenetically driven de-novo cholesterol biosynthesis or residual 
male hormones. The possibility that there might be some CNAs contributing to AI resistance 
was investigated using a shallow whole genome sequencing approach26 to profile several 
cell lines derived from ERα positive BCa MCF7 cells and exposed to distinct endocrine 
treatments12,27 (Supplementary Figure S9A). Among those, LTED cells are derived upon 
chronic estrogen deprivation27,28, mimicking AI treated BCa. Genomic analysis suggests 
that all endocrine resistant cells maintain DNA re-arrangements of parental MCF7 cells 
(Chr3p-20q translocation). However, LTED cells also acquired CNAs around the CYP19A1 
locus (Supplementary Figure S9B). CYP19A1 CNAs were exclusively identified in LTED 
but not in Tamoxifen-Fulvestrant resistant models (Supplementary Figure S9B). We next 
quantified CYP19A1 CNAs using our TaqMan assay (Fig. 3A) and DNA-FISH (Fig. 3B). 
Remarkably, the level of amplification was comparable to the one developed by AI-treated 
patients in vivo (Fig. 1C and 3A). Of note, we could not identify a single CYP19A1amp cell 
in MCF7 cells, suggesting that CYP19A1 CNAs were acquired during treatment. LTED 
cells also undergo a tenfold increase in ERα protein levels12 although we could not find 
significant evidence for ESR1 amplification or ERα activating mutations. Collectively, these 
data demonstrate that estrogen deprivation promotes CYP19A1 CNAs in vitro, in a way 
Magnani et al.

 similar to AI treatment in vivo. CYP19A1amp LTED cells have higher levels of both 
CYP19A1 mRNA and protein compared to CYP19A1wt MCF7 cells (Fig. 3C-E). Single-cell 
RNA-FISH (see online protocol) demonstrates a large degree of heterogeneity in CYP19A1 
expression, however CYP19A1amp cells have a significantly higher chance of accumulating 
more CYP19A1 mRNA molecules per cell (Fig. 3E). We also found that LTED cells have 
significantly higher aromatase activity when compared to MCF7 cells, and this can be 
partially antagonized using AI (Supplementary Figure S10A). CYP19A1amp LTED cells, but 
not CYP19A1wt MCF7 cells, display significant transcriptional activation of three well 
characterized estrogen target genes (e.g. TFF1, EGR3 and CA127) in response to 
androstenedione (Fig. 3F). More importantly, transcriptional activation by androstenedione 
can be partially blocked by AI (letrozole) (Fig. 3F). Collectively, these data indicate that 
acquired CYP19A1 amplification drives increased endogenous aromatase activity and is 
required to promote estrogen independent transcription.
Consistently with transcriptional data, when we investigated the genome-wide ERα binding 
to target genes in MCF7 and LTED cells in the absence of estrogens, we found that the 
chromatin of LTED cells is strongly enriched in ERα binding compared to parental MCF7 
cells (Fig. 4A). As expected, MCF7 cells grown in the presence of estrogen are not sensitive 
to AI (Fig. 4B) while CYP19A1amp LTED cells have low sensitivity (IC50=80uM, Fig. 4C). 
To test the role of CYP19A1amp on AI sensitivity, we then treated LTED cells and parental 
MCF7 cells with two independent siRNA targeting CYP19A1 and measured cell viability in 
response to the AI letrozole (Fig. 4B-D and Supplementary figure S10B). siCYP19A1 
significantly increased sensitivity to AI treatment in CYP19A1amp LTED cells (Fig. 4D) 
while did not affect MCF7 grown in estrogen-supplemented conditions. (Figure 4E and 
Supplementary Figure S10C). CYP19A1 over-expression did not confer any growth 
advantage to MCF7 cells grown in the presence of estradiol. However, CYP19A1 over-
expression was sufficient to relieve cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cultured in absence of 
estrogens. Interestingly, this effect could not be antagonized by letrozole (Fig 4E). Finally, 
we confirmed that ERα still plays a role in CYP19A1amp LTED cells growth as shown 
LTED sensitivity to Fulvestrant treatment (Supplementary Figure S10D). More importantly, 
treating CYP19A1amp LTED cells with an irreversible AI (Exemestane) suggest that 
increased level of aromatase activity can be antagonized with a steroidal AI (Fig. 4F). 
Collectively, these data support our initial hypothesis and suggest that CYP19A1 
amplification might induce reduced sensitivity to reversible AI treatment.
CYP19A1 amplification triggers ERα activity by converting male sex hormones possibly 
obtained through endogenous epigenetic cholesterol biosynthesis12 or circulating within the 
tumor microenvironment. In vivo and in vitro data indicate that CYP19A1 CNAs are 
acquired rather than selected. Indeed, LTED cells develop CYP19A1 CNAs over the course 
of chronic estrogen deprivation (> 1 year). We then analyzed the time to first relapse 
merging our AI patient datasets. Interestingly, relapses characterized by CYP19A1 CNAs 
emerged significantly later compared to WT CYP19A1 (median 57 vs 30 months Amp vs. 
WT, p=0.0112 Log-Rank Mantel-Cox test). These data support the notion that breast cancer 
cells treated with AI slowly evolve to create a favourable autocrine microenvironment for 
themselves through genetic and epigenetic reprogramming (Fig. 4G). One unexplained 
clinical observation is that patients progressing under reversible AI treatment (letrozole/
Magnani et al.

 anastrozole) occasionally respond to irreversible AI (i.e. exemestane). Interestingly, the 
disease of five CYP19A1amp-AI patients within our study was stabilised for ~1-year on 
average after switching to exemestane (Supplementary Figures S1-2). Thus, it is tempting to 
speculate that CYP19A1 amplification might arise in response to reversible inhibitors but 
could be antagonized by switching to irreversible inhibitors. Alternatively, it should be 
clinically feasible to antagonize directly the low levels of circulating male hormones 
commonly found in post-menopausal women. Considering that AI normally target 
peripheral tissues, our data also warrant for AI pharmacodynamics studies to evaluate the 
ability of this class of drugs to target directly tumor cells. Taken together, our clinical data 
demonstrate that the evolution of breast cancer is shaped by clinical intervention and thus 
advocate the development of treatment- and setting-specific biomarkers.

On line methods
Adjuvant setting patient selection and tissue preparation
The IEO Data Quality Control Unit selected from the Institutional database a set of 
consecutive breast cancer patients fulfilling the following criteria: i) tumors classified as 
Luminal A-like and Luminal B-like (HER2 negative), in accordance with St. Gallen 2013 
recommendations 29; ii) patients receiving exclusively AIs (#50 pts.) or TAM (#50 pts.) as 
systemic adjuvant therapy; iii) patients with at least one year of follow-up; iv) patients who 
experienced a distant metastasis as first event after surgery and upon adjuvant therapy. 
Patients who initially presented with bilateral breast tumor, receiving neoadjuvant 
treatments, and with metastatic breast disease at the time of presentation or within 12 
months after surgery have been excluded. The initial data set used for this project comprised 
26,495 women who had undergone surgery for a first primary breast cancer at the IEO 
between 1994 and 2014. All the cases prospectively entered the IEO breast cancer database 
and were discussed at the weekly multidisciplinary meeting. Patients have been then 
followed up with physical examination every six months, annual mammography and breast 
ultrasound, blood tests every 6-12 months and further evaluations when symptomatic. Data 
on the patients’ medical history, concurrent diseases, surgery, pathological evaluation, results 
of staging procedures, radiotherapy, adjuvant systemic treatments, events occurring during 
the follow-up and treatments for metastatic disease were available. Use of patients’ data was 
approved by the ethics committee of the IEO and by the Italian Data Protection Authority. 
All patients signed an informed consent. All the primary tumors were fresh sampled, fixed in 
4% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. All the metastatic biopsies were fixed in 
4% buffered formalin. Detailed information regarding tumor type and grade, ER/PgR and 
Her-2 status and Ki-67 labelling index were available in all the cases of primary and

 metastatic tumors. ER/PgR and HER2 immunoreactivity was assessed in line with the 
clinical practice procedures applicable at diagnosis. Her-2 immunoreactivity was assessed 
using the monoclonal antibody CB11 (Novocastra, 1:800) from 1995 till 2005, and the 
HercepTest (Dako) thereafter. Cases classified as Her-2 2+ by immunohistochemistry were 
tested by FISH analysis with Vysis probes, in accordance with the ASCO/CAP guidelines. 
Ki-67 labelling index was assessed by the Mib-1 monoclonal antibody (Dako, 1:200), by 
counting at least 500 invasive tumor cells, independent of their staining intensity and without 
focusing on hot-spots. Only tumors classified as Luminal A-like (ER and PgR positive, 
absence of Her-2 overexpression and Ki-67 <20%) and Luminal B-like (ER positive, Her-2 
negative and at least one of Ki-67 ≥20% and PgR <20%) in accordance with St. Gallen 
recommendations were included in the study29. All the samples (primary tumors and paired 
metastatic deposits) from the patients satisfying the aforementioned criteria have been 
reviewed at the IEO Division of Pathology (University of Milan) for assessing tumor 
cellularity and for tumor enrichment by macrodissection, if necessary. DNA from all the 
samples has been extracted by commercially available kits (QIAmp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit, 
QIAGEN) and the DNA yielding has been measured by Qubit Fluorimetric Quantitation 
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Finally, two 3 µm thick slides has been cut from all the samples 
and put on charged slides for FISH analysis.
DNA extraction and TaqMan assay
For tumor samples Hematoxylin/Eosin-stained sections were prepared assessing the 
percentage of tumor cells and evaluated by a pathologist. Samples with less than 80% of 
tumor cells were micro-dissected to increase the percentage of tumor cells. Matched normal 
DNA was extracted from from non-metastatic axillary lymph nodes or histologically non-
neoplastic breast samples obtained from mammary quadrants macroscopically free of 
disease. Genomic DNA from FFPE tissue sections was extracted using QIAamp FFPE 
Tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TaqMan Copy Number 
Assay (Applied Biosystems) for CYP19A1 gene (Hs00116110_cn) and ESR1 gene 
(Hs02488982_cn) was performed using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied 
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. TERT, RNAsep, GARBR3 genes 
were analysed as endogenous reference genes (Applied Biosystems, cat# 4458373, cat# 
4403326 and cat# hs_05365082_cn). Copy number for each sample was estimated by using 
the Copy Caller Software V1.0 (Applied Biosystems) using the matched normal counterpart 
as reference. CN range bars indicated the minimum and maximum CN calculated for the 
sample replicates.
Targeted sequencing and in silico analysis
An AmpliSeq Custom Panel was designed using Ion AmpliSeq Designer 2.2 (http://
www.ampliseq.com/) against the exons of TP53, ESR1, PI3K, GATA3, MAP3K1 and 
CYP19A1 genes. For the preliminary analysis we filtered the design taking into 
consideration previously identified mutations (COSMIC, 141 amplicons, supplementary 
table 2). For the validation replicate we then included the entire set of exons (184 
amplicons). Libraries were generated from 10 ng of DNA (tumour and normal) using the Ion 
AmpliSeq Library Kit v2.0 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Quantification of the libraries was performed using the Quant-iT dsDNA HS assay kit and a

 Qubit2.0 fluorimeter (Life Technologies). Templates were prepared from a pool of 
equimolar amounts of each library using the Ion PGM Template OT2 200 Kit with 
OneTouch2 system (Life Technologies). Samples were sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM™ 
sequencer using the Ion PGM™ 200 Sequencing Kit v2.0 on Ion 318™ chips. Data were 
analyzed using IonReporter and MuTect30 to compare metastatic samples with normal DNA 
(normal breast samples extracted from the same patient).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis
A FISH co-hybridization using a specific clone covering the altered locus and the specific 
alpha-satellite, as control probe for ploidy status, was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin 
embedded sections. Specifically, RP11-66L23 BAC clone for the CYP19A1 locus at 
15q21.2 (red signal) and 15 Alpha Satellite probes (green signal) were used for the 
identification of CYP19A1 gene amplification. The BAC clone was selected using the 
University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser Database (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) 
and was tested on normal human metaphase cells to verify the absence of cross-
hybridization while the alpha-satellite probes were kindly provided by Dr. M. Rocchi, 
University of Bari, Italy. FISH experiments were performed as previously described, with 
minor modifications31. An average 30 representative nuclei scored per sample, scanning 
several areas to account for potential heterogeneity was counted to calculate the 
amplification ratio.
Single Cell RNA-FISH
The protocol for adherent mammalian cell lines was optimized for Stellaris FISH probes. 
Hybridization was performed overnight and no anti-fade was used for imaging. The 
sequence of the CAL Fluor Red 590 tagged probes targeting the CYP19A1 mRNA can be 
provided upon request. Samples were imaged using a Nikon Ti-E scanning laser confocal 
inverted microscope (A1) with 60x oil objective in tandem with Nikon NIS-Elements 
imaging software. Excitation was by 561.5 nm diode-pumped solid state. Detection was via 
595-50 nm filter. Optical sections were captured at 0.300 μm intervals and a resolution of 
256 by 256 pixels and zoom factor of 6.8, resulting in a voxel size of 0.0047 μm3 (0.1243 
μm by 0.1243 μm by 0.3 μm). Four times averaging was used to reduce photon and camera 
noise. An automated spot count algorithm determined the number of mRNA 32. For the 
analysis we included 30 positive control cells to better define an mRNA spot.
Cell lines and hormone manipulation
Parental MCF7 breast cancer cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s 
medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). MCF7 cells and its derivatives 
were authenticated using STR profiling. Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma 
contamination. The chronically estrogen deprived MCF7-derived LTED breast cancer cell 
lines were maintained in phenol-red free DMEM containing 10% charcoal stripped fetal calf 
serum (SFCS). Both media were supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/mL 
penicillin 0.1 mg/mL. Estradiol 10−8 M (E2758 Sigma) was added routinely to MCF7. Both 
cell lines were starved for 48h before further treatments. Subsequently, both cell lines were 
treated with 10−8 M Estradiol or Androstenedione (25nM final Concentration). LTED cells 
were also treated in the presence or absence of the Aromatase Inhibitor Letrozole (100nM

 final concentration). After 24 hours, cells were lysed and RNA extracted with RNAeasy 
Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
The quantity, quality and integrity of isolated mRNA were confirmed by absorption 
measurement and RNA gel electrophoresis. One (1) µg of RNA was retrotranscribed by 
using iSCRIPT (BioRad) containing random hexamers. Afterwards, quantitative real time 
PCR was carried out using SYBR select master mix (Life technologies, Paisley, UK), and 
ERα targets expression (TFF1, EGR3 and CA12) assessed. Values were quantified using the 
comparative threshold cycle method and target genes mRNA expression was normalized to 
GAPDH. Primers are available upon request. Results are expressed as means ± SEM. One-
way Anova statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism, and with GraphPad 
Software (GraphPad Software, Inc., Avenida de la Playa, La Jolla, USA). Two-sided p-
values < 0.05 are considered statistically significant and are expressed as *p < 0.05. For 
CYP19A1 protein quantitation we used the Abcam ab71264 antibody. siRNA for CYP19A1 
were obtained from ThermoFisher (siSilencer Select pre-validated s3875 and s3877). siRNA 
was transfected at 5nM final concentration two days prior to SRB analysis (day 0). SRB 
proliferation measurements were obtained after three further days of culture in the presence 
of increasing amount of letrozole. Experiments were conducted using five technical 
replicates and three independent biological replicates. CYP19A1 overexpressing cells were 
obtained by transfecting MCF7 cells with full length CYP19A1 (RC205890, OriGene 
Technologies) and selection using G418. SRB proliferation experiments were conducted as 
described above. For the exemestane challenge, MCF7 and LTED cells were plated in 
identical numbers and then treated with increased dose of exemestane (Tocris BioScience). 
SRB proliferation experiments were conducted as described above.
Patient-derived xenografts of ER+ breast cancer patients
Patient-derived xenografts were established from of ER+ metastatic breast cancer patients by 
injecting circulating and disseminated cancer cells isolated from the peripheral blood (CTC-) 
pleural effusion fluids (BPE-) or ascites (BA) into NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl mice, as 
described33,34. Analysis of DNA was performed from first or second passage xenograft 
tumors established in a mouse mammary fat pad. Animal care and all procedures were 
carried out according to German legal regulations and were previously approved by the 
governmental review board of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany 
(Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe authorization number G240/11). This human material was 
obtained either from patients admitted to the University Clinic Mannheim Department of 
Gynecology or from patients recruited at the division of Gynecologic Oncology of the 
Heidelberg University Hospital. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the 
University of Heidelberg-Mannheim (case number 2011-380N-MA).
Survival Analysis
Kaplan-Meier plots were generated using PRISM (v5). We analyzed the time that separated 
the date of surgery from the date of first relapse (for all patients with univocal histology 
numbers). Data were analyzed using a Log-Rank Mantel-Cox test. Curves were also 
significantly different when analyzed using a Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test.

 Aromatase activity assay
Aromatase activity was evaluated using a 3 H- water release assay using 0.5 µmol/L of [1h- 
3 H]-androst-4-ene-3,17-dione as substrate35. The incubations were performed at 37 °C for 
2 h under an air/CO2 (5%) atmosphere. The results obtained were expressed as fentomole-
picomole/h and normalized to mg of protein (pmol/h/mg of protein).
CNV meta-analysis and Shallow-Sequencing
Meta-analysis of previously published data was conducted using cBioPortal (http://
www.cbioportal.org/index.do). Amplification was scored as positive for GISTIC values of 
>2 (Amplified). SNPs array were interrogated using caSNP (http://cistrome.org/CaSNP/) 
using a CT threshold >3. Shallow-sequencing analysis were conducted using previously 
published data 12. Briefly, Input SAM files from resistant cell lines were used as ChIP 
tracks in MACS 1.4 against Input tracks generated in MCF7 cells. BED and WIG files were 
generated using default settings 36
ChIP-seq
ERα ChIP-seq data re-analyzed from previously published data 12. ERα bound regions 
were clustered using CHASE using K-means clustering (n=3) 37 (http://
chase.cs.univie.ac.at/overview). RPKM plots were created for each specific cluster 
comparing tags from MCF7 and LTED cells. ChIP-seq data can be accessed under GEO 
profile GSE60517.
Statistical Methods
Mann-Whitney’s, Student’s T test (2-sided) and one way/two ways ANOVA with 
Bonferroni’s posttest have been used as indicated in the figure legends. Assumptions on 
normal distribution and equal variance have been tested prior to statistical test’s using 
ANOVA.
