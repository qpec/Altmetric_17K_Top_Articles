ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess the efficacy of probiotic therapies on body weight and BMI using a meta-
analysis of randomized, controlled trials.
Methods: Twenty studies with 25 trials (1931 participants with age over 18 years) were included.
The pooled WMD was calculated by random effects model.
Results: Probiotic consumption significantly reduced body weight by 0.59 kg (95% CI, 0.30–0.87)
and BMI by 0.49 kg/m2 (95% CI, 0.24–0.74). A greater reduction in BMI was found with multiple
species of probiotics. Subgroup analysis of trials with intervention duration �8 weeks found a
more significant reduction in BMI. Limiting analysis to trials with a baseline BMI �25 kg/m2
showed a greater reduction in BMI.
Conclusion: Consuming probiotics could reduce body weight and BMI, with a potentially greater
effect when multiple species of probiotics were consumed, the duration of intervention was �8
weeks, or the objects were overweight.

Introduction
Overweight [defined as a body-mass index (BMI) of
�25 kg/m2]
and
obesity
(defined
as
a
BMI
of
�30 kg/m2) (Sanchez et al. 2014) are affecting a grow-
ing number of people, particularly in Western coun-
tries (Gregg et al. 2007; He et al. 2014). The prevalence
of overweight or obesity has increased notably since
1980
in
the
United
States
(Flegal
et
al.
1998).
Overweight and obesity should be paid more attention
because of the well-established relationship between
excess body weight and diseases such as type 2 diabetes
mellitus, hypertension and coronary artery disease
(Garcia-Rio et al. 2014; Grossschadl et al. 2014; Nie &
Ardern 2014). In light of the long-term safety and effi-
cacy of weight-loss medications not having been estab-
lished, behavioral interventions are considered the
primary means to lose weight efficiently.
Probiotics, which are defined as live microorganisms
that may gain a health benefit for the host when
administered
in
adequate
amounts,
have
attracted
increasing interest in recent years (Reid et al. 2003).
The
beneficial
effects
of
probiotics
on
regulating
immune system function and preventing diarrhea have
been demonstrated (McFarland 2006; Szajewska et al.
2007; Moro-Garcia et al. 2013). Recent researches on
diets supplemented with probiotics have been directed
toward the control of biomarkers of the basic metabol-
ism for different hosts (Pereira & Gibson 2002; Guo
et al. 2011; Tan et al. 2013; Lindsay et al. 2014). One
study found that consumption of probiotics resulted in
a
significant
increase
in
high
density
lipoprotein
(HDL) and a decrease in glycemia (Moroti et al. 2012).
To date, quite a few researchers have investigated the
effects of probiotics on body weight and BMI, without a
consistent result. Some studies reported that consump-
tion of probiotics for both 8 and 12 weeks could signifi-
cantly reduce BMI (Chang et al. 2011; Kadooka et al.
2013),
whereas
other
studies
showed
no
benefit
(Kadooka et al. 2010; Shakeri et al. 2014). These incon-
clusive reports on the effect of probiotics on body weight
and BMI directed us to conduct a systematic review and
meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of probiotic therapies
on body weight and BMI. This meta-analysis may pro-
vide further information on the efficacy of the probiotic
species and the duration of probiotic consumption
required to confer health and weight control.

were also identified by a hand search of all the referen-

studies published in the English language.
Study eligibility
Articles were eligible for meta-analysis if they met the
following inclusion criteria: (1) articles were human
randomized, controlled trial, (2) subjects were over 18
years, (3) the body weight or BMI changes, along with
standard deviation (SD), were reported for the inter-
vention and control groups, (4) subjects were without a
history of gastrointestinal disease and tumor. We did not
consider abstracts or unpublished reports. Case reports,
editorials, review articles and letters were excluded.
Articles were also excluded if they did not include a con-
trol
population.
The
present
study
was
performed
according to PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al. 2009).
Data extraction
Two researchers (Zhang QQ and Wu YC) conducted an
initial screening of studies independently. The next phase
involved a review of abstracts and an examination of the
full text in terms of the eligibility criteria. The final eligi-
bility of the articles was determined through agreement
of the two reviewers. The following characteristics were
collected from each study: the first author, year of publi-
cation, study design, characteristics of participants, spe-
cies of probiotics, daily dose of probiotics, and baseline
measures and changes from baseline of BMI or body
weight in intervention and control groups. Meanwhile,
we did not define any minimum number of interven-
tions or controls to be included in our meta-analysis. A
summary of study flow is presented in Figure 1.
Statistical analysis
BMI was defined as the weight in kilograms divided by
the square of the height in meters. The SDs of the
changes of body weight and BMI from baseline were
calculated using the formula (Higgins & Davis 2014)
below (1) when the studies involved in this meta-ana-
lysis did not report them. The effect of probiotic use
on BMI and weight was defined as the weight mean
difference of BMI and weight changes between the
intervention groups and control groups. Statistical ana-
lysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.2 (The
Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) & STATA 11.0
(Stata, College Station, TX). The pooled WMD of each
study was calculated by the random effects model
regardless of heterogeneity (Higgins & Davis 2014).
Sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis and meta-regres-
sion were also performed. The p value <0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. Additionally we assessed
the probability of publication bias with Begg’s funnel
plots and Egger’s test, with p value <0.10 considered
representative of statistically significant publication bias
(Higgins & Davis 2014).

selection for the meta-analysis is shown in Figure 1.
Twenty studies with 25 trials, with 1931 participants
in total, were included in the final systematic review
and meta-analysis. Nineteen of the included studies
were parallel randomized, controlled trials, with 16
studies
reporting
double-blind
design
(Agerholm-
Larsen et al. 2000; Naruszewicz et al. 2002; Kadooka
et al. 2010; Sadrzadeh-Yeganeh et al. 2010; Chang et al.

Shakeri et al. 2014) and three not reporting the blind-
ing process (Hata et al. 1996; Bonorden et al. 2004;
Savard et al. 2011). Another included study was a
cross-over randomized, controlled trial with double-
blind design (Zarrati et al. 2013).
The characteristics of included trials are presented
in Table 1. Nineteen trials reported changes in BMI
and
21
trials
reported
changes
in
body
weight
(n ¼ 1548 for BMI analysis; n ¼ 1545 for weight ana-
lysis). Of the 25 trials, 11 included healthy participants,
four included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,
two included patients with hypercholesterolemia, one
included patients with hypertension, four included
overweight and obese subjects, two included patients
with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and one included
patients with metabolic syndrome. Except four trials,
the mean BMI of all trials was over 25 kg/m2. The pro-
biotic species and dose used varied between trials.
Eight trials used single species of probiotics and the
rest used more than one species of probiotics. The total
daily dose of probiotic consumption varied from 106
colony-forming units (CFU) to 1012 CFU. The dur-
ation of the trials varied from three weeks to 24 weeks
(8.76 weeks on average, eight weeks on median), so we
chose eight weeks as cutoff point for the subgroup ana-
lysis of the intervention duration.
Risk of bias assessment
The risk of bias of all included studies was assessed by
the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of
bias of randomized trials (Higgins & Davis 2014).
Table 2 presents the risk of bias assessment of all
included articles. Most articles did not clearly describe
the method of randomization (85%, n ¼17), whether
the allocation of the participants to study groups was
concealed (95%, n ¼19) and selective reporting (100%,
n ¼20). A low risk of bias was achieved for most of
the studies regarding incomplete outcome data (90%,
n ¼18), other sources of bias (90%, n ¼18) and blind-
ing of participants (85%, n ¼17).
Main outcomes
Of the 19 trials reporting changes in BMI, all with
double-blind design, 16 reported a reduction after con-
suming
probiotics. The
meta-analysis
of 19
trials
showed a significant reduction of BMI by 0.49 kg/m2
[95% confidence interval (CI), 0.24–0.74; p < 0.01]
compared with control groups. The forest plot of the
effect was presented in Figure 2. A high level of statis-
tical heterogeneity was observed for the meta-analysis
of BMI (I2 ¼ 92%; p < 0.1).
Of the 21 trials presenting changes in body weight,
15 reported a reduction after consuming probiotics.
The meta-analysis result showed a significant reduction
of 0.54 kg (95% CI, 0.27–0.82; p < 0.01) in mean differ-
ence of body weight compared with control groups
(Figure 3), with high heterogeneity (I2¼30.0%; p < 0.1).
Evaluation of heterogeneity and sensitivity
analysis
Meta-regression analyses were performed to evaluate
the extent to which different variables explained the
heterogeneity. The results revealed that the heterogen-
eity could be explained by the duration of intervention
[linear regression coefficient¼ �0.21 (95% CI, �0.28 to
�0.14), p < 0.01] and the numbers of species of probi-
otics [linear regression coefficient¼ �0.47 (95% CI,
�0.73 to �0.20), p < 0.01] in the effect of probiotics
on BMI. However, age of subjects, year of publication
and total sample size were not statistically correlated
with heterogeneity (p > 0.05). Meta-analysis of trials
with multiple species of probiotics found a significant
reduction of BMI by 0.65 kg/m2 (95% CI, 0.32–0.98;
p < 0.01) (Table 3). Those trials using single species of
probiotics as the treatment did not show a meaningful
reduction compared with control groups. Duration of
intervention �8 weeks resulted in a significant reduc-
tion
of
BMI
by
0.74 kg/m2
(95%
CI,
0.38–1.10;
p < 0.01). Those interventions with duration of inter-
vention <8 weeks did not produce the same results.
Limiting analysis to trials with a baseline BMI �25 kg/
m2 showed a significant reduction of 0.58 kg/m2 (95%
CI, 0.28–0.88; p < 0.01) in BMI compared with control
groups.
Meta-regression of trials found that the heterogen-
eity could be explained by the duration of intervention
[linear regression coefficient¼ �0.41 (95% CI, �0.23 to
�0.05), p < 0.01] in the effect of probiotics on body
weight. However, the numbers of species of probiotics,

 age of subjects, year of publication and total sample
size were not statistically correlated with heterogeneity
(p > 0.05). Duration of intervention �8 weeks resulted
in
a
significant
reduction
of
0.78 kg
(95%
CI,
0.50–1.05; p < 0.01) in body weight compared with
control groups. Those interventions with duration of

results.
Publication bias diagnostics
We further identified the potential publication biases
of literatures by Egger’s test and Begg’s funnel plot. In
all trials, the shapes of funnel plot indicated no obvious
asymmetry (Figures 4 and 5) and Egger’s test provided
statistical evidence for the funnel plot symmetry. No
significant publication bias was found in the trials
(p ¼ 0.290 for BMI; p ¼ 0.833 for body weight).
Discussion
Recently,
the
health
benefits
of
probiotics
have
attracted increasing attention (Lin et al. 2014). Not
only can probiotics improve immune system function
and prevent diarrhea (Demers et al. 2014; Forsythe
2014) but may also ameliorate physiological function.
This review was conducted to clarify the effects of pro-
biotic consumption on body weight and BMI control.
Based on our findings from the included 25 trials, we
found that consumption of probiotics significantly
decreased body weight and BMI by a modest degree.
Similar results about the effect of probiotics on other
physiological parameters have been reported. Khalesi
et al. (2014) conducted a systematic review of random-
ized clinical trials that investigated the effects of probi-
otics on blood pressure. The meta-analysis concluded
that consuming probiotics for �8 weeks could signifi-
cantly reduce systolic blood pressure by 3.56 mmHg and
diastolic blood pressure by 2.38mmHg. Additionally,
another meta-analysis showed that probiotic therapy
had a significant but weak effect on decreasing the levels
of total cholesterol (Ma et al. 2013). Though the benefi-
cial effect of probiotics reported in these studies has
been modest, a previous study demonstrated that even a
small improvement of physiological parameters may
have notable public health benefits (Sleight et al. 2001).
The
number
of
probiotic
species
used
in
the
included trials varied between the trials included in
this meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis of trials using >1
species of probiotics (13 trials) found a significant
reduction in BMI compared with trials using a single
species of probiotics (six trials). Similar findings were
reported in a meta-analysis by Khalesi et al. (2014),

on the control of blood pressure was observed. These
findings may be explained by the variation in the char-
acteristics and effect of different species of probiotics
on metabolism.
The duration of probiotic intervention also varied
between the trials included in this meta-analysis. Findings
from the subgroup analysis indicated that a greater reduc-

 should be emphasized, which showed that the mean BMI
decreased significantly in the metformin/probiotic group
compared
with
the
metformin/placebo
group
(�5.2±1.39kg/m2 versus �0.04±1.62kg/m2). This effect
may be due to the longer intervention duration (24
weeks), which in other trials were just 6–9 weeks and
even two trials sustained only 3–4 weeks. Moreover, this
result also indicated that probiotics may enhance the
effect of metformin on weight loss. Not only can metfor-
min reduce hyperglycemia, but it has also been noted to
prevent weight gain or even to promote weight loss in
adults (DeFronzo & Goodman 1995; Fontbonne et al.
1996). Further investigations are required to explore the
combined effect of metformin with probiotic and the
mechanisms involved.

 Another important finding of this meta-analysis was
the variation in the effect of probiotics on BMI based
on baseline level of BMI. The mean baseline of BMI in
the 15 trials was �25kg/m2. Sensitivity analysis of these
trials showed a greater reduction in BMI. This finding
suggests that probiotics may be more efficient on
decreasing BMI in people who are overweight or obese.
Overweight and obesity, the most common nutri-
tional disorders, are known to be caused by the meta-
bolic imbalance (Siebler et al. 2008). Furthermore, the
identification of differences in the intestinal microbiota
of obese and thin people suggests the involvement of
microbiota in energy homeostasis and storage of lipids
(Zhang et al. 2009). Changes in microbial composition
have been observed in diabetic animal models and in
those with metabolic syndrome, which reinforces its
possible association with metabolic disorders (Vijay-
Kumar et al. 2010; Geurts et al. 2011). Due to evidence
pointing a relationship between intestinal microbiota
and obesity, a few researchers explored if it was pos-
sible to manipulate microbiota to prevent obesity or
contribute to weight reduction. A recent study showed
a six-month weight-loss effect of Lactobacillus planta-
rum DSM 15313 in high-energy-dense diet adminis-
tered to rat mother and offspring (Karlsson et al.
2011). Another study reported that type 2 diabetic and
obese mice (db/db) treated with probiotics exhibited
reduced body weight, fat mass and inflammatory tone
by inducing changes of the gut microbiota composition
at the phylum, family and genus levels (Hongoh et al.
2003). The impact of probiotics on weight may work
through several different mechanisms. For example,
probiotic treatment may increase gut microbiota fer-
mentation, lower appetite and increase satiety, which is
associated with an increase in plasma gut peptide con-
centrations (glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY)
(Million et al. 2012). Other mechanisms such as
improving other metabolic issues may explain the
effect of probiotics on body weight. A recent meta-ana-
lysis on the effects of probiotics on blood lipids
reported a significant 6.4 mg/dL reduction in total
cholesterol, a 4.9 mg/dL reduction in low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol level and a 3.9 mg/dL reduction in
triglycerides level (Guo et al. 2011). Another meta-ana-
lysis showed that probiotic-fermented milk produced a
significant
reduction
of
3.1 mmHg
in
SBP
and
1.1 mmHg in DBP compared with placebo groups
(Khalesi et al. 2014). This anti-obesity effect could be
an important adjunct in the treatment of obesity,
because apart from surgery, no medical treatment can
efficiently support the fight against obesity to date.
There are several limitations to this review. The bias
of the included studies may have affected the results of
the meta-analysis, for instance, the dietary restrictions,
exercise and physical activities in almost studies were
not described. Besides, three studies did not use blinding
and most of included studies were of a small sample
size. Moreover, two studies had a quite short duration
of only 3–4 weeks of probiotic consumption, which may
affect the overall results of the meta-analysis and most
of included studies did not mention intention-to-treat
analysis and compliance criteria. Last, the language
restriction (only English language), the few number of
databases searched, lack of search in grey literature and
absence of pre-published protocol, which may induce
important bias in sensitivity analyses. More studies with
larger sample groups, longer durations and adequate
blinding of trials are required to confirm the effect of
probiotic products on body weight and BMI.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis showed that pro-
biotic consumption could reduce body weight and BMI
significantly. The improvement was greater among
overweight and obese population when the probiotic
administration lasted more than 8 weeks. The study
also suggested a greater effect from consuming multiple
rather than single species of probiotics. The effect of
probiotics on body weight, especially in population
with overweight and obesity, as well as their mecha-
nisms involved need further investigation. This study
provides useful information on the effects of probiotics
on body weight and BMI, which could make a signifi-
cant contribution to the application of probiotics as
novel therapies in overweight and obesity.
