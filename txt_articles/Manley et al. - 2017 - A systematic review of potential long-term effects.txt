ABSTRACT
Objective Systematic review of possible long-term 
effects of sports-related concussion in retired athletes.
Data sources Ten electronic databases.
Study selection Original research; incidence, risk 
factors or causation related to long-term mental health 
or neurological problems; individuals who have suffered 
a concussion; retired athletes as the subjects and 
possible long-term sequelae defined as >10 years after 
the injury.
Data extraction Study population, exposure/outcome 
measures, clinical data, neurological examination 
findings, cognitive assessment, neuroimaging findings 
and neuropathology results. Risk of bias and level of 
evidence were evaluated by two authors.
Results Following review of 3819 studies, 47 met 
inclusion criteria. Some former athletes have depression 
and cognitive deficits later in life, and there is an 
association between these deficits and multiple prior 
concussions. Former athletes are not at increased 
risk for death by suicide (two studies). Former high 
school American football players do not appear to 
be at increased risk for later life neurodegenerative 
diseases (two studies). Some retired professional 
American football players may be at increased risk for 
diminishment in cognitive functioning or mild cognitive 
impairment (several studies), and neurodegenerative 
diseases (one study). Neuroimaging studies show modest 
evidence of macrostructural, microstructural, functional 
and neurochemical changes in some athletes.
Conclusion Multiple concussions appear to be a 
risk factor for cognitive impairment and mental health 
problems in some individuals. More research is needed 
to better understand the prevalence of chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy and other neurological conditions and 
diseases, and the extent to which they are related to 
concussions and/or repetitive neurotrauma sustained in 
sports.
InTRODuCTIOn
There is tremendous interest in understanding the 
possible long-term effects of concussions sustained 
during a career in sports. It has been believed for 
decades that repetitive neurotrauma sustained in 
boxing is associated with chronic brain damage in 
some former athletes. In case descriptions dating 
back to the 1920s, some long-career boxers have 
been described as having a neurological syndrome 
referred to as ‘punch drunk syndrome’,1 traumatic 
encephalopathy2 dementia pugilistica,3 chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)4 and chronic 
progressive traumatic encephalopathy.5 In recent 
years, a number of studies have been conducted 
with former NFL players. There is emerging 
evidence that some retired NFL players have mild 
cognitive impairment,6 7 neuroimaging abnor-
malities8 9 and differences in brain metabolism10 
disproportionate to their age. Autopsy cases of 
former professional football players have revealed 
diverse forms of neuropathology, including immu-
noreactivity for hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) 
in a specific pattern (eg, irregularly distributed 
in depths of cortical sulci) in which p-tau is not 
expected to be present through normal ageing 
or in association with frontotemporal dementia 
or Alzheimer’s disease.11 This article represents 
a systematic review of the existing literature on 
possible long-term effects of sport-related concus-
sions, including risk for Alzheimer’s disease and 
CTE.
MeThODS
A systematic review was performed to address 
the question of long-term effects of sport-related 
concussion for the 5th International Consensus 
Conference on Concussion in Sport: ‘What is 
the current state of the scientific evidence about 
the prevalence, risk factors, and causation of 
possible long-term sequelae like CTE and other 
neurodegenerative diseases, with respect to sports 
concussion?’ 
Additional 
questions 
addressed 
included (i) what are the definition, clinical 
features and underlying pathophysiology (if 
any) of ‘subconcussive blows’ (ie, subconcussive 
impacts) and (ii) what have we learnt from the 
retired athlete population?’
Search terms and databases
Keywords were selected by agreement of all 
authors and then submitted to a librarian with 
expertise in systematic reviews who developed 
a draft MEDLINE search strategy. This was 
reviewed by a second expert health sciences 
librarian using the CADTH Peer Review Check-
list for Search Strategies according to the PRESS 
2015 Guideline Statement. The draft search 
strategy was revised based on suggestions from 
the PRESS review, and then tested to be sure 
known key studies were retrieved. The MEDLINE 
search (see online supplementary table 1) was 
adapted and translated for all other databases.

Review
The following 10 databases were searched: MEDLINE (Epub 
Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 
Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R)), CINAHL 
Plus with Fulltext, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycARTICLES and SPORT-
Discus. The search was limited to English-language and 
peer-reviewed publications, but had no date restriction. The 
search was conducted 10–11 September 2016.
Study selection criteria and data extraction
Studies were included if they (i) were original research; (ii) 
evaluated the incidence/prevalence, risk factors or causation 
related to neurodegenerative disease; (iii) included individuals 
who have suffered a sport-related concussion; (iv) evaluated 
athletes and/or retired athletes as the study subjects and (v) 
evaluated possible long-term sequelae defined as >10 years 
after sports-related injury. Studies were excluded from this 
review if they were published in a language other than English, 
animal studies, review articles, case reports, book chapters, 
conference abstracts, editorials/commentaries/expert opinion, 
theses or dissertations.
Citations were independently screened by pairs of authors. 
A third reviewer adjudicated disagreements between authors. 
Following the initial abstract and title screening process, 
 
full-text articles were retrieved and data were extracted using 
a  
standardised method. Results were extracted by one author 
 
and reviewed by a second author to ensure accuracy and 
completeness.
Assessment of risk of bias and level of evidence
For each article that met inclusion criteria, risk of bias and 
strength of evidence were independently rated by two authors 
using the Downs and Black checklist.12 The level of evidence was 
assessed using the Oxford 2011 Level of Evidence13 criteria and 
rated by two authors.
ReSulTS
The database search identified 7145 articles (figure 1, 
note correction: in figure 1, the PRISMA diagram,  Records 
excluded n = 3,756 PRISMA). After duplicates were removed, 
3819 records were screened and a total of 47 were included in 
this review. Those articles are listed in table 1. Online supple-
mentary table 2 presents a summary of the key findings from 
these studies. Online supplementary table 3 presents a review 
of the methodological quality and risk for bias of the 47 studies. 
The average methodological quality rating using the Downs and 
Black criteria for these 47 publications was 8.1.
Subconcussive head impacts
Interest has been expressed in the concept of ‘subconcussive 
blows’ (ie, subconcussive head impacts) as an indicator of repeti-
tive neurotrauma. Subconcussive impacts are typically defined as 
involving the transfer of mechanical energy to the brain at enough

force to injure axonal or neuronal integrity, but not be expressed 
in clinical symptoms.14 15 These impacts have been proposed as 
a separate variable from concussion history by some researchers. 
We reviewed five subconcussive impact studies that (i) defined 
the concept or (ii) quantified the criteria (ie, years of exposure, 
estimated number of impacts). These studies are discussed, in 
part, in the sections below. They either discussed the concept 
of subconcussive impacts or added the estimated number of 
subconcussive impacts to the athletes’ concussion history.16 The 
majority of subjects were American football athletes or soccer 
players. Most studies identified significant group-level differ-
ences between ‘high exposure’ and ‘low/no exposure’ athletes,10 
17 18 although there were some studies that did not support the 
notion that repetitive subconcussive impacts have a measurable, 
detrimental effect.19 20 Some studies have drawn inferences about 
subconcussive impacts based solely on a person’s participation 
in certain contact or collision sports. For example, Meehan 
and colleagues20 surveyed >3702 college alumni between the 
ages of 40 and 70, 2121 of whom had no reported history of 
concussion. In those with no reported concussions (a proxy for 
studying subconcussive impacts), there were no differences in 
anxiety, depression, emotional dyscontrol, sleep disturbance or 
perceived cognitive functioning in those who participated in 
collision sports versus those who did not. There was greater use 
of alcohol in former collision sport athletes.
neuroimaging
We reviewed 14 neuroimaging articles relating to the possible 
long-term sequelae of sports-related concussion. These included 
structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and positron emission tomog-
raphy (PET). The majority of subjects were American football 
athletes and soccer players. Most studies identified significant 
group-level differences in these imaging modalities; however, 
lack of standardisation in imaging acquisition and analysis limits 
the generalisability of the findings. The average methodological 
quality rating using the Downs and Black criteria for these publi-
cations was 7.4, and the average level of evidence was 4.0.
Structural imaging
A structural 3 T MRI study of 72 former American professional 
football players with cognitive and mental health symptoms 
revealed a higher rate of cavum septum pellucidum (CSP), greater 
length and greater ratio of CSP to septum length compared with 
14 former non-contact athlete controls.21 The greater length 
of the CSP was also associated with decreased performance on 
a memory test and a test of word pronunciation. Gardner and 
colleagues measured CSP (1.5 and 3 T MRI) in 17 retired Amer-
ican professional football players presenting to a memory clinic 
with cognitive and mental health symptoms.22 Compared with 
matched controls from the memory clinic with no history of 
traumatic brain injury (TBI), CSP was more common in retired 
football players (94% vs 18%) and the length was also signifi-
cantly greater.
Goswami and colleagues reported that football athletes with 
a history of concussion (n=19) had significant cortical thinning 
of the anterior temporal lobe and orbitofrontal cortex compared 
with controls (n=17).23 Koerte and colleagues identified 
decreased cortical thickness in former professional soccer players 
(n=15).10 (NOTE: Koerte citation 10 should be Koerte citation 
18)Group-level analyses of cortical thickness revealed greater 
cortical thinning with increasing age in right inferolateral-pari-
etal, temporal and occipital cortex, and this was associated with 
lower cognitive performance. Strain and colleagues found that 
older retired athletes with at least one remote history of concus-
sion with loss of consciousness had significantly smaller bilateral 
hippocampal volumes and decreased memory performance.24
Diffusion tensor imaging
In a study of 37 amateur soccer players, a lifetime concussion 
history was not associated with changes in fractional anisot-
ropy (FA) or cognitive performance.25 However, high-frequency 
soccer heading (>885 per year) was associated with lower 
memory scores and lower FA in three regions of interest in 
the temporo-occipital white matter. In a study of 10 boxers (8 
retired, 2 active), there were no group differences in FA between 
the boxers and non-contact sport controls, although DTI 
metrics were associated with declarative memory and reaction 
time.26 Using whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics analysis, 
18 retired professional football players were compared with 
17 healthy controls.27 They found no differences in FA but did 
find increased axial diffusivity in the right hemisphere of retired 
players in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, corticospinal tract 
and anterior thalamic radiations, suggesting possible axonal 
degeneration in these tracts.
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy
Koerte and colleagues studied 11 former professional soccer 
players without a history of concussion compared with 14 
age-matched controls.10 In the soccer players, a significant 
increase was observed in both choline, a membrane marker, and 
myo-inositol (ml), a marker of glial activation. There were no 
significant differences in neurocognitive testing between groups. 
Increased levels of choline and glutamate/glutamine were also 
found in five former professional male athletes with history of

multiple concussions and multiple symptoms compared with 
control athletes with no history of brain trauma.17
Positron emission tomography
A PET study explored the use of 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoro-
ethyl) (methyl)amino]−2 naphthyl} ethylidene) malononitrile 
(FDDNP) for measuring both tau and amyloid in living brains.28 
Five former professional American football players with mood 
and cognitive problems were compared with five age, educa-
tion and body mass-matched controls. FDDNP binding signals 
were higher in players versus controls in subcortical regions and 
amygdala. The authors noted that the study was limited by the 
small sample size and lack of pathological confirmation.
Cognitive functioning and mental health
We reviewed 24 articles relating to possible long-term cogni-
tive and mental health problems associated with concussion. 
The average methodological quality rating using the Downs and 
Black criteria for these publications was 9.7, and the average level 
of evidence was 3.8. Some of these studies are cross-sectional 
surveys.7 20 29–31 Some in-person clinical assessment studies have 
been conducted with8 10 17 18 21–24 26–28 32 33 and without7 19 34–37 
neuroimaging. There are also studies that begin with a survey 
and then have a follow-up in-person assessment.38 A number of 
cross-sectional studies have identified decrements on objective 
neuropsychological testing7 8 24 37 and subjectively experienced 
cognitive difficulties on self-report measures6 20 in former 
athletes. Some studies report a frequency–response relationship, 
with greater cognitive impairments in those with greater levels 
of exposure to head impacts or concussions.16 36 However, other 
studies have not found a frequency–response relationship when 
examining cognitive function.8 31 33 Guskiewicz and colleagures 
surveyed 2552 retired NFL players and found that 1.3% (n=33) 
reported a physician diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Of the 758 
who were aged ≥50, 2.9% (n=22) reported a physician diagnosis 
of mild cognitive impairment. Of the 641 former players who 
had a spouse or close relative complete a questionnaire, 12.0% 
(n=77) were identified as having significant memory prob-
lems. Former players with 3+ concussions during their playing 
career had a fivefold greater risk of mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) diagnosis after age 50 compared with those with no prior 
concussions.6 Randolph and colleagues surveyed 513 retired 
NFL players aged ≥50 for whom their wives completed a ques-
tionnaire regarding memory. In this sample, 35.1% had a score 
on a scale completed by their spouses (AD8) that was suggestive 
of possible cognitive impairment.7 This is much higher than the 
12.0% rate reported in the previous study,6 for unclear reasons. 
The rate of clinical diagnoses of MCI (vs survey screening) is 
unknown.
Regarding mental health, depression has been most frequently 
studied. Five studies report a frequency–response relationship 
between concussions or head impact exposure and depres-
sion symptom reporting.16 30 35 39 40 Didehbani and colleagues 
studied cognitively intact former NFL athletes and found 
greater depression symptoms compared with age and intel-
ligence quotient (IQ)-matched subjects.35 In a sample of 797 
former collegiate athletes (all sports), approximately 39% 
of whom reported one or more prior concussions, their rates 
of self-reported mental health and cognitive problems were 
as 
follows: 
depression=10.4%, 
anxiety=16.2%, 
alcohol 
dependence=5.8%, substance use=2.9% and cognitive prob-
lems=3.8%.30 This sample also completed the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to screen for depression. The rate of 
screening positively for depression (ie, PHQ-9≥10) stratified by 
concussion history was as follows: 0=2.8%, 1=5.6%, 2=10.4% 
and 3+=8.9%.31 The rate of self-reported depression in retired 
NFL players (n=1044), stratified by concussion history, was as 
follows: 0=3.0%, 1–2=8.2%, 3–4=13.7%, 5–9=19.3% and 
10+=26.8%.29
The link between soccer heading, cognitive functioning and 
psychological health is unclear. No association between cognitive 
function and length of career or position played was found in 
older (mean age=67 years) retired professional soccer players.19 
Similarly, former professional soccer players who still play 
recreationally were found to have largely similar performance 
on a variety of cognitive assessments compared with matched 
non-contact sport athlete controls.18 In this study, however, the 
soccer players had a greater decrease in cortical thickness with 
age—and cortical thickness in parietal and occipital areas of 
the brain were negatively correlated with lifetime estimates of 
heading.
Five long-term effects cohort studies using medical record 
linkage or death certificates41–45 have been published, one after 
the cut-off date for this systematic review.45 The results of these 
studies are summarised in online supplementary table 1. Three 
studies of causes of death in former NFL players have been 
published.41–43 T
wo of these studies examined the death certif-
icates of those who died between 1960 and 2007 (334 deaths 
from a cohort of 3439 former players). All cause and specific 
mortality rates (eg, cancer, cardiovascular disease, pulmo-
nary disease and other health problems) were lower in former 
players than in men from the general population.42 43 Baron 
and colleagues reported that the rates of psychiatric illness and 
suicide were significantly lower in the former athletes than in 
men from the general population.42 They also reported that 
diseases of the nervous system and sense organs were somewhat 
higher than men in the general population, but the difference 
was not statistically significant. Of the 334 former players who 
had died, 12 (3.6%) had one of these latter diseases listed on his 
death certificate when it would have been expected, from popu-
lation estimates, that the number should be 9.7 people (ie, 2.9%). 
There was no autopsy confirmation of the diseases listed on the 
death certificate and no analysis of genetic susceptibility (eg, 
apolipoprotein E). In a reanalysis of the same data set, Lehman 
and colleagues43 reported that the rates of Alzheimer’s disease 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were higher in former 
NFL football players compared with men in the general popu-
lation. Of the 334 death certificates reviewed, the number of 
times neurodegenerative diseases were listed as an underlying or 
contributing cause of death was as follows: Alzheimer’s disease/
dementia=7 (2.1%), Parkinson’s disease=3 (0.9%) and ALS=7 
(2.1%). In two medical record linkage studies of former high 
school football players,44 45 the rates of dementia, mild cognitive 
impairment and parkinsonism did not differ in comparison to 
control subjects (see table 2).
neuropathology
Autopsy studies have revealed multiple forms of neuropathology, 
both macroscopic and microscopic, in former contact and colli-
sion sport athletes. Macroscopic findings include (i) frontal and 
temporal atrophy, thinning of the hypothalamic floor, shrinkage 
of the mammillary bodies, pallor of the substantia nigra, hippo-
campal sclerosis and reduction in brain mass; (ii) enlarged 
ventricles and (iii) CSP with or without septal fenestrations.46–48 
Microscopic features include (i) localised neuronal and glial 
accumulations of p-tau with varying microscopic morphologies,

involving perivascular areas of the cerebral cortex and sulcal 
depths, and with a preference for neurons within superficial 
cortical laminae; (ii) multifocal axonal varicosities involving 
deep cortex and subcortical white matter; (iii) variable and often 
absent Aβ deposits and (iv) TDP-43-positive inclusions and neur-
ites.46–48
We reviewed nine neuropathology studies that included five 
or more subjects. These reports focused on the pathology asso-
ciated with CTE. The average methodological quality rating 
using the Downs and Black criteria for these publications was 
5.2, and the average level of evidence was 4.2. In 2010, McKee 
et al described the neuropathology of 12 former athletes (7 foot-
ball players, 3 boxers and 1 hockey player) whose brains and 
spinal cords had been donated to the Center for the Study of 
Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medi-
cine.49 Subjects ranged in age from 42 to 85 years (average age 
65) and all had a history of cognitive and behavioural changes 
associated with CTE. Three of the athletes also had signs and 
symptoms of motor neuron disease (MND). P-tau immunore-
activity in neurons and astroglia in the depth of sulci was noted 
in all subjects. Seven of the nine cases without MND also had 
TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions.
In 2011, Omalu et al reported autopsy findings in 17 
athletes (14 professional, 3 high school).50 Selected brain 
samples or whole-brain specimens were examined by routine 
histopathology, special stains and immunohistochemistry. 
CTE pathology was based on the presence of topographically 
distributed neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads, with or 
without amyloid plaques, and the absence of features indicative 
of another tauopathy. The authors found CTE changes in 10 
of the 14 professional athletes and 1 of 3 high school athletes 
(71% overall). The authors noted four histological phenotypes, 
based on relative abundance of p-tau in cerebral cortex, subcor-
tical structures and brainstem, and presence or absence of diffuse 
β-amyloid plaques.
In 2013, McKee et al described the neuropathology in 85 
subjects with a history of mild TBI, 64 of which were former 
athletes.11 The brains of 18 cognitively intact controls with no 
history of repetitive mild TBI were also examined. The diag-
nosis of CTE was based on p-tau immunoreactivity around small

The two studies of high school football players are medical record linkage studies and illustrate the rates of diagnoses present in those records. The three studies of former NFL 
players are based on reviewing death certificates and address underlying or contributing causes of death. There were 3439 former NFL players, of whom 334 died between 1960 
and 200742 43, and 537 died between 1960 and 2013.41 The differing methodologies do not allow a direct comparison between high school and former NFL athletes. *Controls 
were non-football-playing male varsity athletes, such as swimmers, wrestlers and basketball players.
†Controls were non-football-playing male students in the glee club, band or choir.

Review
blood vessels at the depths of cortical sulci, clusters of p-tau-pos-
itive subpial and periventricular astrocytes, and neurofibrillary 
tangles in the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex—this 
pathology was identified in 80% of the cases and none of the 
control subjects. Other abnormalities included TDP-43 immu-
noreactivity (85% of cases) and comorbid neurodegenerative 
disease including MND (12%), Parkinson’s or Lewy body disease 
(16%), Alzheimer’s disease (11%) and frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration (6%). A neuropathological staging system for CTE 
(stages I–IV) was also proposed.
In 2013, Hazrati described a series of six retired profes-
sional Canadian football players whose ages ranged from 61 
to 87 years.51 The subjects had a history of multiple concus-
sions and medically or family member documented cognitive, 
behavioural and/or motor symptoms. Three of the six subjects 
had neuropathological findings consistent with CTE. The 
other three subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, 
Parkinson’s disease and MND. In addition, the CTE cases 
showed comorbid pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, vascular 
disease and cancer.
Bieniek and colleagues studied a range of neurodegenerative 
disease cases along with a small number of normal controls.52 
Review of available medical records from 1721 men identified 
66 cases with a history of contacts sports. The authors found that 
21 of the 66 cases (32%) had cortical p-tau staining consistent 
with CTE. None of the 162 control brains, and none of the 33 
cases with a history of a single TBI, had CTE pathology. This 
study was conducted using a neurodegenerative disease brain 
bank, so there were comorbid neurodegenerative conditions 
(Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration) in 20 of the 21 cases with CTE.
Ling and colleagues53 conducted a large-scale postmortem 
study of CTE in the UK using the McKee et al11 criteria. They 
screened 268 cases and found histological evidence of CTE in 
32 (11.9%), including cases of women with this pathology. The 
mean age at death was 81 years. The majority of the positive 
cases met neuropathological criteria for other neurodegenerative 
diseases and had prior exposure to at least one TBI.
Until 2015, there was no consensus regarding the neuropatho-
logical criteria for the diagnosis of CTE. The National Institutes 
of Neurological Disease and Stroke and National Institute of 
Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NINDS/NIBIB) funded 
a panel of neuropathologists to establish criteria. The consensus 
panel defined the pathognomonic lesion of CTE as an accu-
mulation of p-tau in neurons and astroglia distributed around 
small blood vessels at the depths of cortical sulci and in an irreg-
ular pattern.54 In addition to p-tau-related supportive criteria, 
TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions and macroscopic features 
(ventricular enlargement and CSP) were identified as supportive 
of CTE.
Koga et al55 examined 139 cases of multiple system atrophy 
(MSA) using NINDS/NIBIB CTE criteria. CTE pathology was 
found in 8 (6%) of the 139 MSA cases, all of which were male, 
and 4 with a history of contact sports. The authors also noted 
that 7.2% were identified as having ageing-related tau astrogli-
opathy (ARTAG), a pathology that should be differentiated from 
CTE pathology. The authors speculated that falls secondary to 
the movement disorder may cause CTE pathology.
neurological and mental health features of CTe
Prior to 2005, slurred and dysarthric speech, gait problems, 
parkinsonism and cognitive impairment (including dementia) 
were considered common clinical features of CTE.56–58 Although 
historical case descriptions sometimes included histories of 
mental health problems and severe substance abuse, these were 
not considered core features of the condition. The largest 
study examining the clinical features of chronic brain damage 
in living subjects was published as a monograph by Roberts in 
1969.57 From a list of 16 
781 retired boxers, Roberts selected an 
age-stratified random sample of 250; he was able to locate and 
clinically examine 224 of these men.57 He concluded that 17% 
had the syndrome (11% had a mild form of the syndrome and 
6% had severe problems). For boxers over the age of 50 who 
had ≥150 fights, 50% had the syndrome compared with 7% 
with <50 fights. In recent years, the clinical features of CTE 
have been greatly expanded to include many psychosocial prob-
lems, depression, anxiety, anger and other health problems.11 46 
48 50 More research is needed to determine the extent to which 
those problems are associated with the neuropathology of CTE. 
Proposed criteria for diagnosing CTE have been published by 
Jordan,59 Victoroff60 and Montenigro and colleagues.61 At 
present, however, there are no agreed upon or validated clinical 
criteria for CTE, thus there is no accepted method for diag-
nosing CTE in a living person.
DISCuSSIOn
This systematic review identified 47 studies relating to possible 
long-term problems with brain health associated with sport-re-
lated concussion (see table 1 and online supplementary tables 
2 and 3). The methods used included clinical assessments, 
cross-sectional surveys, neuroimaging and autopsies. Several 
cohort studies using medical record linkages or death certificates 
have also been published.41–45 The majority of studies included 
were a lower level of evidence (mainly level 4 or 5 with only 9 
studies having level 3 evidence). All but one study included in 
this review had risk of bias scores
< 13, highlighting the potential of threats to the internal and 
external validity of these studies.
Subconcussive impacts
A small number of studies examined the possible long-term 
effects of subconcussive head impacts. There are significant 
methodological challenges associated with the study of subcon-
cussive impacts.15 The challenge researchers face at this time 
is that (i) there is no established definition of a subconcussive 
impact or a subconcussive injury, (ii) a impact may or may not 
cause an injury, and it is difficult to determine if an injury has 
occurred, and (iii) the biomechanical features and thresholds 
for quantifying a impact and identifying an injury have not 
been agreed upon. Therefore, the hypothesis that subconcus-
sive impacts cause long-term neurological injury requires more 
research before conclusions can be drawn.
neuroimaging
Imaging studies have been conducted mostly with former Amer-
ican professional football players,8 21–24 27 28 32 33 but also with 
former soccer players10 18 21 and boxers.26 Imaging studies of 
retired professional football players reveal structural changes in 
the brain such as cortical thinning18 23 and CSP
,21 22 62 functional 
changes in brain metabolism,32 as measured by functional MRI, 
microstructural differences in white matter,8 9 as measured by 
DTI, and accumulations of tau on PET imaging28 in some former 
athletes. The literature to date has significant methodological 
limitations that lower the overall level of evidence and temper 
confidence in conclusions that can be drawn. The imaging liter-
ature includes studies that likely are not representative of the

Review
broader population of former athletes. In reviewing the meth-
odology and results of some imaging studies, it is sometimes 
unclear the extent to which positive findings were based on 
a priori hypotheses, exploratory post hoc analyses or both. A 
significant methodological weaknesses in the literature is lack 
of replication. Although positive findings have been reported in 
studies within an imaging modality, such as DTI or MRS, the 
specific findings within those studies differ.
Clinical studies
In total, 18 of the 24 studies relating to possible cognitive and 
mental health problems associated with exposure to collision 
sports and concussions have been published in the past five 
years, reflecting the interest in this topic and rapid growth 
of the knowledge base. These cross-sectional clinical studies 
and survey studies reveal that some of the former athletes 
have cognitive deficits or decrements6 7 36 37 and psycholog-
ical health problems.16 29 35 Survey studies have revealed that 
a substantial minority of former NFL players have mental 
health problems,63–65 and current depression is more likely 
in those with a history of concussions.29 It is also important 
to appreciate that chronic pain and opioid use is relatively 
common in former NFL players,66 and those with depression 
and chronic pain also have greater life stress and financial 
difficulties.64 There are at least three unanswered questions 
relating to these studies. First, the contribution of repetitive 
subconcussive head impacts to these clinical features is poorly 
characterised and understood. Second, a frequency–response 
relationship between concussions, head impact exposures and 
the severity of future clinical symptoms is unknown. Finally, 
modifying factors for the development of clinical symptoms 
and problems in association with repetitive neurotrauma are 
largely unknown.
neuropathology
Nine neuropathology studies were included in this review, 
seven of which were published between 2010 and 2016. 
Autopsy studies have revealed diverse forms of macroscopic 
and microscopic neuropathology in former athletes.11 48 50 51 
Prior to 2015, there were no agreed upon neuropatholog-
ical criteria for identifying CTE. The new consensus criteria 
provide a preliminary standardised approach to describe the 
neuropathology of CTE.54 The new consensus criteria differ 
from the criteria for CTE used in past studies, particularly 
by excluding tau pathology that is associated with ageing: 
primary age-related tauopathy67 and ARTAG.68 Importantly, 
tau pathology and the accumulation of other altered proteins 
such as Aβ, α-synuclein and TDP-43-positive immunoreac-
tivity occurs with human ageing and several neurodegenerative 
diseases, and can also be found in people who are cognitively 
normal69; thus, it would be incorrect to assume that all such 
pathology is unique to, or caused by, CTE. To date, a cause 
and effect relationship between CTE and concussions or 
exposure to contact sports has not been established. More 
research on CTE is needed to better understand the incidence 
and prevalence of CTE pathology, the extent to which the 
neuropathological findings cause specific clinical symptoms, 
the extent to which the neuropathology is progressive, the 
clinical diagnostic criteria and other risk or protective factors. 
Well-designed case–control and cohort studies can begin to 
answer these important questions. Longitudinal studies are 
needed.
limitations
A major limitation in the clinical assessment, survey, neuroim-
aging, cohort and autopsies studies published to date is that 
most do not consider relevant third variables when examining 
the association between prior concussions and long-term brain 
health problems. When evaluating the association between 
an ‘exposure’ (ie, concussion or repetitive head impacts) and 
‘outcome’ (eg, long-term brain health problems), the possible 
roles of a relevant third variable are (i) effect modifier (eg, host 
susceptibility factors), (ii) intermediary and (iii) confounder. 
There are many candidate third variables that might be associ-
ated with the long-term cognitive and mental health of former 
athletes, from the psychiatric and neuroscience literature, 
including genetics, childhood adversity, personality factors, 
resilience, family history of mental health and neurological 
problems, steroid use, drug and alcohol use, opiate misuse, 
chronic pain, depression, anxiety, life stress, marital and family 
problems, diet and nutrition, exercise, obesity, diabetes, heart 
disease, other general medical problems, small vessel isch-
aemic disease and a diverse range of neurological conditions 
and diseases. In a survey study of former Division I collegiate 
athletes, for example, socioeconomic (ie, income) and nutri-
tional factors (ie, greater fat and cholesterol and overall lower 
diet quality) were associated with perceived cognitive difficul-
ties in older adults.70
Our systematic review has several methodological limita-
tions. First, studies with negative findings are less likely to be 
published, and we only reviewed published studies, so there is 
a potential for publication bias in our conclusions. Second, we 
only included English-language articles, so there is potential 
for language bias influencing our conclusions. Third, we could 
not pool data across studies and meta-analyse risk associations 
or effect-modifying factors. Finally, the literature has major 
methodological limitations overall, and organising the review 
specifically as a best evidence synthesis might have resulted 
in more tempered conclusions about associations between 
multiple concussions and specific long-term outcomes.
COnCluSIOn
In conclusion, there is evidence that some former athletes in 
contact, collision and combat sports suffer from depression39 
and cognitive deficits6 7 later in life, and there is an association 
between these deficits and a history of multiple concussions.6 
Former athletes are not at increased risk for death by suicide.41 
71–73 Former high school American football players do not 
appear to be at increased risk for later life neurodegenerative 
diseases according to two studies.44 45 Retired professional 
American football players may be at increased risk for mild 
cognitive impairment.6 7 An increased risk for neurodegenera-
tive diseases in retired American football players is suggested 
in one study examining death certificates,43 but more research 
is needed. Neuroimaging studies show modest evidence of 
macrostructural,21 22 24 microstructural,27 functional23 32 33 and 
neurochemical10 17 changes in some athletes. It is important to 
appreciate, however, that survey studies of former collegiate20 30 
31 and professional29 athletes indicate that the majority of people 
rate their functioning as normal and consistent with the general 
population.
There is much more to learn about the potential cause and 
effect relationships of repetitive head impact exposure, concus-
sions and long-term brain health. The potential for developing 
CTE must be a consideration; this condition appears to repre-
sent a distinct tauopathy with an unknown prevalence in former

Review
athletic populations. More research on the long-term sequelae 
is needed to better understand the incidence and prevalence 
of CTE and other neurological conditions among former 
athletes. The causes of mental health and cognitive problems 
in former athletes, like the general population, are broad and 
diverse including genetics, life stress, general medical problems 
(eg, hypertension, diabetes and heart disease), chronic bodily 
pain, substance abuse, neurological conditions and disease (eg, 
cerebrovascular disease) and neurodegenerative diseases (eg, 
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and ALS). The extent 
to which repetitive neurotrauma causes static or progressive 
changes in brain microstructure and physiology, and contrib-
utes to later life mental health and cognitive problems, is 
poorly understood and requires further study.
What is already known?
 
► It has been believed for decades that repetitive neurotrauma 
sustained in boxing is associated with chronic brain damage 
in some former athletes.
 
► Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), also referred to 
as dementia pugilistica, was described mostly through case 
studies between 1928 and 2010—with the exception of one 
large clinical study of boxers published in 1969.
 
► Prior to 2015, there were no agreed upon neuropathological 
criteria for the postmortem diagnosis of CTE. At present, 
there are no agreed upon clinical criteria for diagnosing CTE.
 
► Over the past decade, surveys of retired American NFL 
players have revealed that a substantial minority report 
depression and cognitive decline.
What are the findings?
 
► There is emerging evidence that some retired athletes have 
mild cognitive impairment, neuroimaging abnormalities and 
differences in brain metabolism disproportionate to their 
age.
 
► Survey studies reveal that a minority of former collegiate 
and professional collision sport athletes have depression 
and/or cognitive decline; the majority of former athletes 
report their functioning to be similar to people in the general 
population.
 
► Autopsy cases of former athletes have revealed diverse 
forms of neuropathology, including immunoreactivity 
for hyperphosphorylated tau in a specific pattern (eg, 
irregularly distributed in depths of cortical sulci) in 
which hyperphosphorylated tau is not expected to be 
present through normal ageing or in association with 
frontotemporal dementia or Alzheimer’s disease—and there 
are now preliminary consensus criteria for defining the 
neuropathology of CTE.
 
► More research is needed to better understand the 
incidence and prevalence of CTE pathology, whether 
neuropathological findings cause specific clinical symptoms, 
the extent to which the neuropathology is progressive, 
the clinical diagnostic criteria and other risk or protective 
factors.
