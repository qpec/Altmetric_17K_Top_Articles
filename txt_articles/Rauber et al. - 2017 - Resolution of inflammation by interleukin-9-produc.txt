Abstract
Inflammatory diseases such as arthritis are chronic conditions that fail to resolve spontaneously. 
While the cytokine and cellular pathways triggering arthritis are well defined, those responsible 
for the resolution of inflammation are incompletely characterized. Here we identified IL-9-
producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) as a molecular and cellular pathway that 
orchestrates the resolution of chronic inflammation. In mice, the absence of IL-9 impaired ILC2 
proliferation, activation of regulatory T cells (Treg) and resulted in chronic arthritis with excessive 
cartilage destruction and bone loss. In contrast, treatment with IL-9 promoted ILC2-dependent

 Treg activation and effectively induced resolution of inflammation and protection of bone. 
Rheumatoid arthritis patients in remission demonstrated high numbers of IL-9+ ILC2s in the joints 
and in the circulation. Hence, fostering IL-9-mediated ILC2 activation may offer a novel 
therapeutic approach inducing resolution of inflammation rather than suppression of inflammatory 
responses.

Introduction
Resolution of inflammation is still incompletely understood. In chronic inflammatory 
diseases the physiological process of resolution of inflammation is impaired 1,2. Diseases 
such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often start in young adulthood, but fail to wane requiring 
life-long immunosuppressive treatment3. Furthermore, the body’s failure to effectively 
terminate inflammation leads to pronounced tissue damage such as bone loss4,5. Current 
treatment strategies for chronic inflammatory diseases like RA target pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and hence the activation process of inflammation rather than promoting its 
resolution6,7. While lipid mediators such as resolvins have been implicated in resolution of 
inflammation8, cytokine pathways for governing this process are largely undefined to date. 
Identification of such pathways, however, would allow rebalancing of inflammatory 
responses rather than generally suppressing inflammation and may substantially add to the 
development of new treatment possibilities. We were therefore interested in identifying 
novel pathways governing the resolution of arthritis. We identified interleukin (IL)-9 as a 
master regulator for resolution of arthritis and found that type 2 innate lymphoid cells 
(ILC2s), which produce IL-9 are essential for the initiation of this resolution process.
Results
Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) is a standard model of arthritis with spontaneous resolution 
(Supplementary Fig. 1a)9,10. In contrast, we observed that the course of AIA in Il9−/− mice 
was highly chronic (Fig. 1a). While joint swelling resolved spontaneously within 12–16 days 
in WT mice, it persisted beyond 42 days without signs of resolution in Il9−/− mice. The 
chronic inflammatory phenotype of Il9−/− mice was rescued by overexpression of IL-9 via 
hydrodynamic gene transfer (HDGT), using mini-circle (MC) vectors encoding IL-9 (Il9 
MC) (Fig. 1b). Histological analysis of the affected knee joints of Il9−/− mice at d42 
confirmed persistent synovitis and demonstrated excessive degradation of cartilage and bone 
and higher numbers of osteoclasts in Il9−/− compared to WT mice (Fig. 1c–e). 
Microcomputed tomography showed a pronounced loss of the trabecular network and bone 
volume as signs of inflammation-induced osteopenia in Il9−/− mice (Fig. 1f). In contrast to 
AIA, absence of IL-9 did not affect the course of acute inflammatory arthritis induced by 
monosodium urate crystal, which exclusively relies on neutrophil activation (Supplementary 
Fig. 1b).

 Mice expressing the transgenic T cell receptor (TCR) KRN and the MHC class II allele Ag7 
(K/BxN mice) develop autoantibodies against glucose-6-phosphate isomerase11. Passive 
transfer of serum from those mice is commonly used to initiate chronic arthritis (SIA)12 with 
inflammation persisting over several weeks. To assess the therapeutic potential of IL-9 to 
promote its resolution, we overexpressed IL-9 using HDGT during the effector phase of SIA 
(3 days after induction of SIA). Consistent with our previous findings in AIA, 
overexpression of IL-9 did not have major effects on the initiation phase of SIA or on the 
maximal intensity of arthritis, but strongly accelerated its resolution (Fig. 2a). Joint swelling 
completely resolved within 9 days in mice with forced expression of IL-9, whereas arthritis 
in mice injected with the control vector was still worsening at day 9 (Fig. 2a, b). Histological 
analysis at day 9 showed substantially less synovitis in the paws of mice injected with Il9 
MC (Fig. 2b, c). Accelerated resolution of arthritis by IL-9 translated into reduced tissue 
damage with preservation of cartilage integrity, reduced osteoclast counts and decreased 
bone erosions (Fig. 2b–e).
To further characterize the mechanism by which IL-9 fosters the resolution of arthritis, the 
kinetics of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators were analyzed in the serum and joints of 
arthritic Il9−/− and WT mice (Fig. 3a, Supplementary. Fig. 2a, b). Time kinetics and 
concentrations of most key cytokine mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), 
IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-2 and IL-4 did not significantly differ between WT and Il9−/− 
mice. However, pronounced differences in IL-17 levels were observed which remained 
persistently high in Il9−/− AIA mice, but returned to baseline levels in WT AIA mice. The 
selective upregulation of IL-17 was associated with enhanced Th17 polarization particularly 
in inflamed joints of Il9−/− mice, whereas naïve, memory and effector T cell counts were 
comparable in WT and Il9−/− mice (Fig. 3b, c). These data demonstrate a shift to a persistent 
Th17-cell-driven immune response in Il9−/− mice. To address the possibility that IL-9 serves 
as an intrinsic regulator of Th17 differentiation, CD4 T cells from WT and Il9−/− mice were 
stimulated under Th17-inducing conditions. Differentiation into conventional as well as into 
inflammatory Th17 cells was comparable in WT and Il9−/− mice (Fig. 3d) providing no 
evidence for an intrinsic defect in Th17 development in Il9−/− mice but arguing for a central 
role of other cell types for the IL-9-induced inhibition of Th17 polarization.
To identify these target cells of IL-9, we next analyzed regulatory T cells (Tregs) in WT and 
Il9−/− mice at day 42 after immunization, when inflammation was resolved in WT mice, but 
still persisted in Il9−/− mice. Total numbers of CD4posCD25posFoxp3pos Tregs were 
comparable in Il9−/− compared to WT mice (Fig. 3e). However, the suppressive capacity of 
Tregs from Il9−/− mice was significantly decreased as shown by co-culture of CFSE-labeled 
CD25negFoxp3neg effector T cells (Teffs) with Foxp3pos Tregs and subsequent analyses of 
proliferation of Teffs (Fig. 3f). The functional defect of Il9−/− Tregs was associated with 
significantly decreased expression levels of functionally important effector molecules13,14 
such as GITR and ICOS in Il9−/− Tregs (Fig. 3g). To exclude the possibility that effector T 
cells from Il9−/− mice are resistant to the effects of Tregs, the susceptibility of Il9−/− and WT 
effector T cells to the suppressive effects of WT Tregs was assessed. Both, proliferation and 
cytokine production did not differ between Il9−/− and WT responder T cells (Fig. 3h, i).

 In line with previous reports, exogenous IL-9 modestly enhanced Treg function in vitro (data 
not shown)15. However, prestimulation of Tregs from Il9−/− mice with IL-9 and adoptive 
transfer of these cells into Il9−/− mice did not prevent chronification of AIA (Supplementary 
Fig. 3a). We therefore further aimed to define cellular intermediates that might be involved 
in IL-9-induced resolution of inflammation. To explore the source of IL-9 in arthritis, AIA 
was induced in Il9citrine reporter mice16. The majority of IL-9-producing cells did not 
express lineage (Lin) specific markers that define Linpos lymphocytic and myeloid 
populations including potential IL-9-producing cell types such as Th9 cells17–20 and mast 
cells21 (Fig. 4a). More than 80% of the Linneg citrinepos cells expressed ST2, ICOS (Fig. 
4a), CD25, CD90, and Sca-1 (Supplementary Fig. 3b) suggesting that innate lymphoid cells 
type 2 (ILC2) are the predominant source of IL-9 during the resolution phase of arthritis, as 
defined as the segment of time between the peak of inflammation and 50% regression22 
(Fig. 4a). These data were supported by quantitative analysis of synovial tissue sections from 
AIA WT mice stained with immunofluorescence labeled antibodies. ILC2s were identified 
as the major source of IL-9 during resolution of AIA (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Furthermore, 
expression levels of mast cell-specific genes in inflamed joints did not differ between WT 
and Il9−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). ILC2 numbers were profoundly decreased in the 
synovium of Il9−/− mice (Fig. 4b). Impaired proliferation may account for the reduced 
numbers of ILC2s, as the number of proliferating Ki67 positive ILC2s was significantly 
decreased in arthritic knee joints of Il9−/− mice (Fig. 4b). In line with previous reports that 
IL-9 production by ILC2 acts in an autocrine loop to promote ILC proliferation23,24, 
induction of ILC2s by overexpression of IL-25 and IL-33 using HDGT confirmed an 
intrinsic defect of ILC2 proliferation in Il9−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Addition of 
IL-9 led to complete reconstitution of ILC2s. To confirm the relevance of this finding for the 
pathogenesis of chronic arthritis, multicolor immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) revealed 
that IL-9-producing ILC2s are located in close proximity to CD3posFoxp3pos Tregs in the 
inflamed synovium (Fig. 4c). The co-localization of ILC2s and Tregs in the inflamed tissue 
supports cellular interactions that might be of functional relevance for Treg suppression. 
Indeed, stimulation of ILC2s with IL-9 induced upregulation of the Treg-receptor-associated 
ligands GITRL and ICOSL (Fig. 4d).
To determine the functional impact of interactions between ILC2s and Tregs, we performed 
Treg suppression assays in the presence and absence of ILC2s. These assays demonstrated 
that ILC2s stimulated the suppressive capacity of Tregs. Whereas Il9−/− Tregs alone did not 
suppress Teffs proliferation, addition of ILC2s completely rescued this impaired suppressive 
capacity of Il9−/− Tregs (Fig. 4e). Transwell experiments revealed that these ILC2-mediated 
effects on Il9−/− Tregs required direct cell contacts (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Screening for 
potential mediators of this contact dependent effect revealed that ILC2s express high levels 
of GITRL and ICOSL, which are known to promote the suppressive capacity of Tregs13,14. 
Blockade of GITR/GITRL and ICOS/ICOSL reversed the ILC2 mediated effects on the 
suppressive capacity of Il9−/− Tregs (Fig. 4e). Consistent with this model, ligand binding to 
GITR and ICOS in Il9−/− Tregs also restored the suppressive capacity of Il9−/− Tregs in the 
absence of ICOSL/GITRL-bearing ILC2s (Fig. 4f). In vivo, adoptive transfer of Il9−/− Tregs, 
which had been pre-activated via GITR and ICOS ex vivo, led to a regain of their 
suppressive activity in the AIA model (Fig. 4g), highlighting that receptor/ligand specific

 interactions between ILC2s and Tregs activate the suppressive capacity of Tregs. In order to 
confirm the functional impact of ILC2s on the resolution of inflammation, ILC2s were 
adoptively transferred into Il9−/− mice with AIA. Adoptive transfer of ILC2s inhibited 
activation of Th17 cells and promoted resolution of inflammation in Il9−/− mice (Fig. 4h, 
Supplementary Fig. 4c).
To investigate the role of IL-9 for the resolution of inflammation in humans, synovial tissues 
of patients with RA as prototypical chronic inflammatory joint disease were analyzed. In 
line with previous reports25,26, the dominant part of IL-9 expression in the synovial 
membranes of active RA patients came from Linpos cells (Fig. 5a, b). Only low numbers of 
IL-9pos ILC2s were found in active RA despite extensive synovial inflammation. In contrast, 
RA patients in clinical remission exhibited high numbers of Linneg IL-9pos ILC2s and a 
significant decline of Linpos IL-9pos cells (Fig. 5a, b). Patients with acute joint inflammation 
after trauma demonstrated only a tendency towards increased numbers of Linpos IL-9pos and 
Linneg IL-9pos cells compared to healthy individuals. Longitudinal analysis of infiltrates in 
synovial tissue of RA patients before and 6 months after start of anti-inflammatory treatment 
showed a shift in the cellular source of IL-9 from Linpos IL-9pos cells during active disease 
to Linneg IL-9pos ILC2s 6 months later when anti-rheumatic drugs had led to remission of 
arthritis (Fig. 5c). Stratification of RA patients according to disease activity revealed that 
ILC2 numbers in the blood were particularly low in RA patients with persistent 
inflammatory activity, but significantly higher in RA patients that were in disease remission 
(Fig. 5d, e). ILC2 numbers significantly correlated with disease activity in RA as measured 
by standardized disease activity score 28 (DAS28) (Fig. 5e). Longitudinal observations of 
patients revealed a reciprocal link between ILC2s and disease activity (Fig. 5f). These data, 
taken in combination with the results from the mouse models, indicate a pivotal role of 
ILC2s in the resolution of chronic inflammation and prevention of immunochronicity.
Discussion
Our data demonstrate that IL-9 fosters resolution of inflammation and prevents the 
chronification of arthritis. IL-9 virtually exclusively affected the resolution phase of the 
disease, while only minor effects were observed in the induction phase. In some experiments 
a tendency to higher peak inflammation was observed in IL-9 deficient mice although these 
effects were only mild and not consistent among the experiments. These observations may 
be explained by the regulatory action of IL-9 starting already before the peak of 
inflammation has been reached. Nonetheless induction of resolution of arthritis clearly came 
up as the primary action of IL-9 in arthritis contrasting the effects of other known cytokines 
involved in arhritis such as TNFα, IL-6 and IL-17, which are primarily involved in the 
induction phase and which are successfully targeted by modern cytokine inhibitors. Our data 
show that resolution of arthritis is mechanistically based on the induction of ILC2s by IL-9, 
which in turn elicits GITR/GITRL and ICOS/ICOSL dependent activation of Tregs. This 
IL-9-mediated forced resolution of arthritis translates into reduced tissue damage such as 
bone and cartilage loss, which usually result from chronic inflammation in the context of 
arthritis. Our data provide evidence that IL-9 has a dichotomous function in different phases 
of inflammation. Previous studies have shown that under certain circumstances IL-9 can 
promote inflammation in acute models15,16,27–28. In chronic arthritis however, IL-9 acts as a

 cytokine governing the resolution phase of the disease. These findings are remarkable as 
resolution of inflammation is preferentially attributed to lipid mediators such as resolvins to 
date and little was known about innate/adaptive immune system interactions in orchestrating 
the resolution process2. IL-9 and the function of ILC2s in this process provide strong 
support for the existence of immune pathways, which primarily foster the resolution of 
inflammation and restore immune homeostasis in chronic inflammatory diseases. From the 
therapeutic perspective such approaches are highly attractive as they provide an anchor for 
allowing re-balancing of the pathologic inflammatory response in the near future rather than 
exposing patients to a broad suppression of inflammatory responses.

 Figure 4. ILC2s sustain suppressive capacity of Tregs by co-stimulation via ICOS-L/ICOS and 
GITR-L/GITR
(A) Flow cytometric analysis of AIA in Il9citrine reporter mice (n=7). Cells isolated from 
joints at day 27 were stratified due to viability, IL-9, CD45, expression of lineage markers 
(Lin; CD3ε, CD11b, CD11c, CD45R, CD49b, FcER1a, Gr-1, TER-119), ICOS, and ST2. 
Representative plots are shown. (B) Quantification of ILC2s in ctrl and arthritic joints from 
AIA WT and Il9−/− mice at day 27 (n=5 each) by flow cytometry. Ki67 was co-stained to 
assess proliferation of ILC2s. (C) IF microscopy of inflamed joints of WT mice (n=5) with 
AIA at day 27 stained for Foxp3, IL-9, ICOS and CD3ε. Randomly chosen Tregs from 5 
tissue sections per mouse were analyzed for surrounding cells stratified by IL-9 production 
and surface markers. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. Representative images are shown. (D) 
mRNA expression levels of GITRL and ICOSL in sorted ILC2s cultured in the presence and 
absence of recombinant IL-9 for 72h (n=5 each). (E–G) Treg suppression assay; suppressive

 Figure 5. IL-9 during resolution of human arthritis
(A–C) IF microscopy of human synovial biopsies stained for lineage markers (Lin; CD3, 
CD11b, CD16, mast cell tryptase), ICOS, IL-9 and DAPI. (A) Histomorphometric analysis 
was performed by quantification of Linpos, Linpos/IL-9pos and Linneg/ICOSpos/IL-9pos 
(ILC2) cells per 0.3 mm2 of synovial tissue by five independent and blinded researchers. 
Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. Included are normal controls (n=11), patients with 
acute trauma (n=8), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with active disease (n=19; DAS28 
score >3.2) and RA patients in remission (n=19; DAS28 score <2.6). (B) Representative IF 
images; (C) Quantification of Linpos, Linpos/IL-9pos and Linneg/ICOSpos/IL-9pos (ILC2) cells
