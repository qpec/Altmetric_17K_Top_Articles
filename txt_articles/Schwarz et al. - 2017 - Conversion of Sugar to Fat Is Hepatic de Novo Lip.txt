Epidemiologic studies suggest a link between excess sugar consumption
and obesity, fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes
mellitus. One important pathway that may link these metabolic diseases to
sugar consumption is hepatic conversion of sugar to fat, a process known as
de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Mechanistic studies have shown that diets high
in simple sugars increase both DNL and liver fat. Importantly, removal of
sugar from diets of children with obesity for only 9 days consistently
reduced DNL and liver fat and improved glucose and lipid metabolism.
Although the sugar and beverage industries continue to question the scien-
tific evidence linking high-sugar diets to metabolic diseases, major health
organizations now make evidence-based recommendations to limit consump-
tion of simple sugars to no more than 5% to 10% of daily intake. Clear recom-
mendation about moderating sugar intake to patients may be an important
nonpharmacologic tool to include in clinical practice.

lthough the sugar and beverage industries still try to question the scientific evi-
dence linking high-sugar diets to metabolic diseases, health organizations,
including the World Health Organization,1 the American Heart Association,2
and the US Department of Agriculture,3 have recently published evidence-based recom-
mendations to limit the consumption of simple sugars to no more than 5% to 10% of
daily caloric intake. Communicating clear recommendations about moderate sugar
intake to patients is an important nonpharmacologic way to influence patients’ sugar
intake.
Data from the US Department of Health and Human Services indicate that chronic dis-
eases accounted for 86% of all health care spending in 2010.4 The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention estimated that eliminating 3 risk factors—poor diet, inactivity,
and smoking—would prevent 80% of heart disease and stroke cases, 80% of type 2 dia-
betes mellitus cases, and 40% of cancer cases.5 National health expenditures as a percent-
age of gross national product increased from 6.9% in 1970 to 17.5% in 2014 and are
projected to continue to increase.5 Chronic diseases and conditions such as cardiovascu-
lar disease, stroke, cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and arthritis are among the most
costly and preventable of all health problems. Overall, clear nutritional and lifestyle

 recommendations, as well as effective approaches to
confront this burden, are necessary if for no reason
other than simple economics.
However, nutritional recommendations are not
simple and, over the years, have at times been contra-
dictory. The latest scientific report of the 2015 Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC)3 raised
debates and controversies, in particular with regard to
fat and carbohydrate as sources of energy and their
effects on health.6 Often, powerful food lobbyists
reinterpret the latest scientific discoveries and pressure
the DGAC to temper recommendations that may affect
their financial interests.7 This long tradition was docu-
mented by Kearns et al in 2016.8 In addition, more
rigorous research is needed to be able to articulate
clear, evidence-based recommendations.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the American Heart
Association recommended reductions in dietary fat,
particularly saturated fat. This recommendation led to
an increase in sugar consumption, including both
sucrose (table sugar, which consists of 50% glucose
and 50% fructose) and manufactured high-fructose
corn syrup. However, studies by our group9-13 and
others14,15 have demonstrated that increased consump-
tion of sugar increases the rate of sugar-to-fat conver-
sion by the liver, also called de novo lipogenesis
(DNL). This conversion of sugar to fat generates satu-
rated fat.
In this review, we present the growing evidence sup-
porting our assertion that DNL may be an important
hepatic pathway linking high sugar consumption to
increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, metabolic
syndrome, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD). We focused on studies performed

science.
Historical Perspective for a Role of
Sugar in Obesity
The rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity most
likely reflects changes in lifestyle, such as less activity,
less outdoor time, and more sedentary behavior, or
changes in nutrition, such as change in diet compos-
ition and associated increased intake, which may be
exacerbated by genetic predisposition. Increased con-
sumption of sugar and, more specifically, high-fructose
corn syrup, is one of the strongest candidates.16
Findings from large cross-sectional studies in conjunc-
tion with those from well-powered prospective cohort
studies with long periods of follow-up have shown a
positive association between higher rates of soft drink
consumption and caloric intake, weight gain, and
obesity in both children and adults.17 Studies also
suggest that high consumption of sugar is associated
with a higher risk for hypertension and coronary heart
diseases,18 metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes,19
and NAFLD.20
Despite the reported deleterious health effects of a
high intake of fructose, the Corn Refiners Association
has actively campaigned to emphasize that industrially
produced high-fructose corn syrup is “natural” and
“does not appear to contribute to obesity more than
other caloric sweeteners.”21 Some meta-analyses claim
that the detrimental effect of fructose and other sugars
on lipid levels is confounded by the presence of posi-
tive energy balance and that without excess calories,
sugar consumption
does
not
lead
to
metabolic
abnormalities.22
As far back as 2500 BCE, ancient Egyptians deliber-
ately force-fed carbohydrates to birds to fatten them and
to produce fatty liver, or foie gras. The biological sig-
nificance of DNL in mammals remains controversial to
this day. In 1860, German chemist Justus von Liebig
was the first to postulate the conversion of sugar to fat.
In the 1950s, P. Roy Vagelos, MD, and Salih J. Wakil,
PhD, demonstrated that DNL was a cytosolic pathway
completely distinct from mitochondrial fatty acid
β-oxidation.15 At the time, because of technical

 limitations in the ability to quantitate DNL, it was
believed to occur rarely in humans and to be a physio-
logically unimportant pathway.
In the 1990s, Hellerstein et al23 proposed a revolu-
tionary stable isotope tracer method coupled with mass
spectrometry and mathematical modeling that allowed
investigators
to
noninvasively
measure
DNL
in
humans. Since that time, studies have demonstrated
that high-sugar diets and hepatic DNL can increase the
risk for elevated blood lipid levels, cardiovascular
disease, NAFLD, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes
mellitis.24
Evaluating Dietary Fat and DNL
In healthy people consuming a low- or normal-
carbohydrate diet, DNL measured in circulating very
low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) is
quantitatively minimal in the fasting state (<3% of
VLDL-TG), but it increases approximately 10-fold in
the postprandial state (20%-30% of VLDL-TG)
because of the rise in lipogenic precursors that occurs
after the consumption of a meal.25 In contrast, data
have shown that fasting DNL is quantitatively statistic-
ally significant under the following conditions: (1) after
5 days of energy-balanced, high-carbohydrate feeding
(65%-70% of calories; Figure 1) and (2) after 5 days
of overfeeding with carbohydrate or fructose in excess
of energy (Figure 2).26,27
These data demonstrate that fractional DNL is not
detectable during caloric restriction but increases pro-
gressively to 20% in the fasting state and 30% to 35%
in the fed state after 5 days of carbohydrate overfeeding.
These studies also show that DNL is a very sensitive
and specific marker of recent carbohydrate intake and
energy balance and highlight the importance of consid-
ering the state of energy balance, in addition to carbo-
hydrate intake, in studies of DNL.
In addition, these studies established that both iso-
energetic and hypercaloric diets high in carbohydrates,
especially fructose, are highly lipogenic and produce
elevations in DNL that persist after an overnight fast.
It should be noted, however, that carbohydrate-induced
DNL appears to be specific to simple carbohydrates.
Timlin and Parks25 demonstrated that when simple
sugars are restricted and a diet high in complex carbo-
hydrates (eg, starch) is consumed, DNL is trivial after
an overnight fast.
Likewise, in the fed state, DNL is also determined by
the type of simple sugar consumed. Fructose, but not
glucose, increased hepatic DNL in 6 healthy lean parti-
cipants (Figure 3).9 During 6 hours of fructose inges-
tion, DNL increased 20-fold, and 25% of circulating
VLDL-TG was derived from DNL. In contrast, when the
study was repeated in the same participants using glucose
levels, rates of DNL were unaffected, and only 1% to 2%
of VLDL-TG was synthesized de novo. These data dem-
onstrate that fructose is a potent stimulus to lipogenesis.
Fructose metabolism is unique because, in contrast to
glucose, it is metabolized almost exclusively in the
liver, as its initial metabolism is hepatic. In contrast,
glucose is predominantly metabolized in extrahepatic
tissues, with the liver accounting for only 20% of
glucose metabolism.14 Fructose is metabolized more
rapidly than glucose, providing precursors, such as

 acetyl coenzyme A, for DNL. Animal studies have
shown that fructose is converted to fatty acids at rates
of up to 18.9 times faster than glucose14 and produces
increased TG levels28 and liver fat.29 Overall, fructose
is a potent lipogenic substrate in humans, and it signifi-
cantly increases plasma TG levels.10,11
There is evidence that both hyperinsulinemia and a
diet rich in simple sugars, by promoting DNL, contrib-
ute to hypertriglyceridemia and liver fat accumulation
and, ultimately, to metabolic syndrome.30
Hyperinsulinemia, NAFLD, and
Fasting Hepatic DNL
A large proportion of people with obesity or NAFLD
have insulin resistance,31 and most people with insulin
resistance have increased liver fat concentration.32
Fabbrini et al33 demonstrated that insulin resistance and
other metabolic perturbations in obesity correlate better
with liver fat than with visceral adipose tissue. In contrast
to observations in healthy individuals, participants with
insulin resistance and NAFLD have been found to have
elevated rates of DNL in both the fasting and postprandial
states (26% of VLDL-TG).34 Moreover, analysis of liver
biopsy specimens collected from participants with
NAFLD and chronically elevated DNL revealed that
26% of their liver fat was produced de novo,34 supporting
the hypothesis that hepatic DNL may be an important
contributor not only to postprandial lipids secreted by
the liver but also to liver fat accumulation.
Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between hyperin-
sulinemia and DNL in the following conditions of
hyperinsulinemia, in which fractional DNL is higher:
▪ Obese participants with hyperinsulinemia who were
fed an isoenergetic high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet
had a higher rate of DNL compared with weight-
matched participants without hyperinsulinemia.30
▪ Patients with HIV, hyperinsulinemia, and abdominal
fat accumulation who were fed a weight–maintaining
diet also had higher hepatic DNL compared with
healthy participants.35
▪ Critically ill, insulin-resistant patients fed enteral or
parenteral diets varying in carbohydrate content had
increased hepatic DNL.36-39 These studies demon-
strated that in patients with insulin-resistance, fasting
DNL is increased even under circumstances in which
carbohydrate intake is limited, suggesting that hyper-
insulinemia per se stimulates DNL. This finding was
confirmed by a molecular study in rodents.40
Short-Term Fructose Feeding and
Restriction
Study in Adult Men
A highly controlled metabolic ward study12 was con-
ducted to test the hypothesis that short-term increases
in hepatic DNL would be accompanied by detectable
increases in liver fat concentration. The effects of a
fructose-rich diet (25% of kilocalories) were com-
pared with an isoenergetic diet containing the same
macronutrient distribution but with low fructose
(<4% of kilocalories) on liver fat concentration and
hepatic DNL in healthy participants.12 Eight healthy
men were studied as inpatients for 18 days to control
energy balance and assure strict adherence to the diet,
Figure 2.
In both fasted and fed groups, fractional de novo
lipogenesis (DNL) is significantly increased after 5 days
carbohydrate overfeeding. Values not sharing a common
superscript are significantly different (P<.05).27

 which was formulated and prepared by bionutrition-
ists. The diets were given during consecutive 9-day
periods. Four of the participants consumed the low-
fructose diet first, and the other 4 started with the
high-fructose diet. Fractional hepatic DNL during
feeding was measured using stable isotope tracers and
mass isotopomer distribution analyses. Liver fat con-
centration was measured on day 8 of each dietary
period by magnetic resonance spectrometry on a
3-Tesla scanner.12
Given the aforementioned evidence that DNL can be
acutely increased with hypercaloric feeding and
decreased during hypocaloric feeding, weight was
monitored daily and diets adjusted to carefully maintain
a neutral energy balance. As a result, there were no net
changes in weight or whole-body composition, mea-
sured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, during the
study. After 8 days consuming the high-fructose diet,
mean (SD) DNL during feeding was significantly
higher with the low-fructose group (18.6% [1.4%] vs
11.0% [1.4%]; P=.001). Liver fat concentration was
also higher during high-fructose feeding (median,
137% of values obtained during the low-fructose diet;
P=.013). These differences were observed regardless
of the order in which the diets were consumed.12
Hepatic glucose production, which is typically sup-
pressed by high insulin levels, was not blunted by a
high-fructose diet. This hepatic insulin resistance may
contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.
Hepatic glucose control can be restored by restricting
added sucrose and fructose in one’s diet.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that after as
few as 8 days and in the presence of a neutral energy
balance, a high fructose intake can increase both
hepatic DNL and liver fat concentration. Perhaps most
importantly, this study demonstrated that even short-
term fructose restriction is associated with demon-
strable reductions in DNL and liver fat concentration
and provided the basis for a subsequent study of fruc-
tose restriction in children.
Study in Children
In an outpatient study13 in obese Latino and African
American children with features of metabolic syndrome
(eg, elevated triglycerides, insulin resistance, hyperten-
sion) who reported high levels of sugar intake, 9 days
of fructose restriction with isocaloric substitution of
complex carbohydrates resulted in reductions in fasting
glucose and insulin levels, improved glucose toler-
ance,41 and less atherogenic lipoprotein profiles.42
Importantly, these same participants had a 56%
decrease in DNL during feeding (n=40).13 Although
the children in this study were not selected for the

 presence of liver fat concentration, approximately two-
thirds of them had elevated liver fat concentration
(>5% liver fat fraction by magnetic resonance spectros-
copy). Overall, liver fat concentration decreased by
22% during fructose restriction.13 This study provides
further evidence that carbohydrate quality, specifically
fructose, plays an important role in liver fat accumula-
tion and hypertriglyceridemia and that DNL is an
important factor in these processes.
Beverage Industry Influence
For decades, the beverage industry and investigators
sponsored by the industry have continued to mount vig-
orous and well-funded campaigns against public health
policies intended to encourage limitation of soda and
sugar consumption. Recent reports document that
many institutions and respected academicians have
received support from the beverage and sugar indus-
try43 and have described the extensive efforts of indus-
try groups to maintain control over the messages
regarding sugar consumption and metabolic diseases.6,44
A 2016 publication8 strongly urges that policy-making
committees should be cognizant of the bias that might
be introduced by corporate sponsorship.
Clinical Implications
Efforts to reverse the obesity epidemic in the United
States have been largely unsuccessful. While the rate
of obesity continues to increase globally, there is a
growing body of literature demonstrating how lifestyle
and dietary interventions can have a profound effect.
Many obese people seem to be mired in the fact that
the management of obesity is long and very difficult.
The present review details data demonstrating that
changing the dietary intake of fructose can significantly
reduce DNL and its unhealthy metabolic sequelae in as
little as 9 days and, furthermore, this benefit can occur
even without any loss of weight. This finding allows
us, as health care professionals, to reframe the discus-
sion from weight loss to attaining better health in just
a week and a half. To quote Andrew Taylor Still, MD,
DO,45 “To find health should be the object of the
doctor. Anyone can find disease.” These studies can
be used to help explain to our patients the rationale as
to why they should follow the most recent dietary
recommendations to limit simple sugars to no more
than 5% to 10% of their daily intake. Should patients
adhere to these recommendations, it may well be the
first step to facilitate their body to self-regulate, self-
heal, and begin its return to a state of health
maintenance.
Conclusion
There is increasing evidence from both epidemiologic
and interventional studies of the deleterious effects of
consuming sugar-sweetened beverages and other foods
containing fructose and other added sugars, even in the
absence of weight gain. Chronically elevated DNL
during both fasting and feeding may be a key mechan-
ism in the link between consumption of added sugar
and metabolic abnormalities, including obesity, high
lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, NAFLD, insulin
resistance, and type 2 diabetes.
