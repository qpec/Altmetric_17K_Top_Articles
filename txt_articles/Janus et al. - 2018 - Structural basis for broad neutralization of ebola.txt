The severity of the 2014–2016 ebolavirus outbreak in West Africa expedited clinical devel-
opment of therapeutics and vaccines though the countermeasures on hand were largely
monospecific and lacked efficacy against other ebolavirus species that previously emerged.
Recent studies indicate that ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP) fusion loops are targets for cross-
protective antibodies. Here we report the 3.72 Å resolution crystal structure of one such
cross-protective antibody, CA45, bound to the ectodomain of Ebola virus (EBOV) GP. The
CA45 epitope spans multiple faces of the fusion loop stem, across both GP1 and
GP2 subunits, with ~68% of residues identical across > 99.5% of known ebolavirus isolates.
Extensive antibody interactions within a pan-ebolavirus small-molecule inhibitor binding
cavity on GP define this cavity as a novel site of immune vulnerability. The structure eluci-
dates broad ebolavirus neutralization through a highly conserved epitope on GP and further
enables rational design and development of broadly protective vaccines and therapeutics.

 T
he genus ebolavirus of the family filoviridae is composed of
five species, including Zaire (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV),
Bundibugyo (BDBV), Reston (RESTV), and Taï-For-
est (TAFV). Three of these species, EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV,
have previously led to fatal outbreaks in humans. The 2014–2016
outbreak of EBOV strain Makona in West Africa, the most lethal
outbreak documented thus far, resulted in over 28,000 cases and
11,000 deaths1. Its emergence in an unexpected geographical
location and possible zoonotic adaptation to human cells indi-
cates future outbreaks, including of other ebolavirus species,
could emerge with unforeseen characteristics2,3. As such, devel-
opment of vaccines and therapeutics that are cross-protective and
focus on vulnerable regions of the virus that are conserved across
ebolaviruses can offer potentially more durable protection less
prone to escape or to the idiosyncrasies of any one emerging
species. Several recent studies have reported isolation of cross-
protective antibodies against ebolaviruses, including from human
survivors and immunized animals, with some of the most broad
and potent antibodies shown to target epitopes near or within the
glycoprotein (GP) fusion loop at the GP1–GP2 subunit interface
of GP4–7.
Fusion loops of membrane enveloped viruses form an inte-
gral component of the molecular machinery that mediates
fusion of the virus and cell membranes during virus entry. In
ebolaviruses, the fusion loop is encoded by N-terminal residues
of the GP2 subunit and is composed of a hydrophobic internal
fusion peptide flanked by an extended fusion loop stem, made
up of GP2 strand β19–β20, and a disulfide-bonded base8. In the
prefusion state of GP, which is the target conformation of
neutralizing and protective antibodies, the fusion loop is found
wrapped around the outer equatorial surface of the glycopro-
tein, forming a close interface with the GP1 core8. Engagement
with the host-cell endosomal receptor Niemann-Pick C1-C
(NPC1-C) and possible additional triggers are thought to lead
to conformational rearrangement of the GP subunits, release of
the fusion loop, insertion of the fusion peptide into the host-cell
endosomal membrane, followed by formation of helical repeat
hairpins that catalyze virus–host cell membrane fusion9–13.
Various subregions of the ebolavirus fusion loop have been
reported to be targeted by neutralizing antibodies, as also
described for other viruses14,15, likely a result not only of the
loop’s functional role but also, in the case of ebolaviruses, its
placement along the outer GP1–GP2 interface of GP8,16–18.
Recently, a potent cross-protective antibody, CA45, was iso-
lated from cynomolgus macaques immunized with trivalent
cocktails of recombinant EBOV, SUDV, and Marburg virus
(MARV) GPs. The CA45 antibody was shown by saturation
mutagenesis and an 11 Å electron microscopic (EM) recon-
struction to bind GP in the vicinity of the GP fusion loop7, with
its binding site partially overlapping the binding sites of anti-
bodies KZ52, c2G4, and c4G75,7. In contrast to these latter
antibodies, however, CA45 was found to be near pan-ebolavirus
reactive with the capacity to recognize the GP ectodomains of
four out of five ebolavirus species—EBOV, SUDV, BDBV, and
RESTV—at binding affinities of 10.6, 3.3, 1.2, and 161 nM,
respectively7. Low pH conditions were found to improve CA45
binding to GP, suggesting the antibody can maintain interaction
with the virus even after trafficking into acidic endosomal com-
partments7. CA45’s breadth of GP recognition was reported to
extend to its breadth of virus neutralization and protection.
Depending on the viral assay and species, CA45 neutralized with
IC50 values ranging from 0.9 to 78 nM, while it protected against
EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV virus challenge in mice, guinea pigs, or
ferrets, when administered alone (against SUDV) or in con-
junction with a previously characterized receptor-binding region
antibody FVM04 (against EBOV and BDBV)5,7,19.
To uncover the structural basis for the breadth of CA45-
mediated ebolavirus neutralization, we determined the crystal
structure of the fragment of antigen binding (Fab) of antibody
CA45 bound to a mucin-domain deleted ectodomain of EBOV
GP. The structure shows that CA45 targets the stem of the GP
fusion loop and mediates extensive interactions with both its GP1
and GP2 subunits. Dissection of sequence variation within the
CA45 epitope reveals critical determinants of breadth of recog-
nition, and structural comparison with other antibodies and
ligands defines an inhibitor-binding cavity as a site of immune
vulnerability. We utilize the structure to elucidate molecular
factors that underlie somatic selection of a critical deletion in the
CA45 heavy chain—one that enables antibody recognition of a
pre-primed GP ectodomain, and that likely contributes to anti-
body inhibition of cathepsin loop cleavage. Our analysis reveals
structural determinants for near pan-ebolavirus recognition and
efficacy by an immunization-induced antibody and lays the
groundwork
for
further
development
of
cross-protective
countermeasures.
Results and Discussion
Crystal structure of CA45-EBOV GP complex. The GP ecto-
domain of EBOV strain Mayinga-76 with a deleted mucin-like
domain (GPΔMuc) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a) was
expressed transiently in mammalian HEK293S GNTI−/− cells
and purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The pur-
ified glycosylated GPΔMuc protein was incubated with the
antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of antibody CA45, and the
resulting complex separated and further purified by SEC. The
CA45 Fab-EBOV GPΔMuc complex was set up in a panel of
sitting drop vapor diffusion crystallization screens, yielding
crystals that in one condition diffracted X-rays to 3.72 Å (Fig. 1a,b
and Table 1). Indexing and processing revealed a rhombohedral
crystal lattice, in space group H32. The structure was solved with
molecular replacement using the unliganded structure of EBOV
GP (PDB ID 5JQ3) and the structure of a macaque antibody
(PDB ID 3Q6G) as search models20. One CA45 Fab-GP protomer
complex was present in each asymmetric unit, yielding three
CA45 Fabs per GP trimer (Fig. 1b, c). Ordered electron density
corresponding to both GP subunits and to the CA45 Fab was
observed and utilized for model building, although density for the
constant region of the antibody was less well ordered, most
notably for the heavy chain (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
The CA45 antibody in the present structure approached GP
from the side, similar to other base-binding antibodies that target
the equatorial surface of GP and consistent with the reported 11
Å EM reconstruction (Fig. 1b, c)7,8,16,17. Structural comparison of
CA45-bound EBOV GPΔMuc with unliganded and NPC1-C
receptor-bound GPs revealed CA45 recognized a conformation
of GP more similar to the unliganded form (Supplementary
Fig. 1c)11,21. Several differences with unliganded GP were
however observed. These included a shift in strand β1–β2 and a
distinct β-strand organization in the glycan cap, which was likely
imposed by crystal lattice contacts that displaced strand β18 with
strand β17 of a neighboring lattice molecule (Supplementary
Fig. 1d). Electron density corresponding to glycan moeities was
observed in three out of nine N-linked glycosylation sequon sites,
two of which were present solely as N-acetyl glucosamines. At the
third position, N563, electron density corresponding to a full
Man-5 glycan was observed (Supplementary Fig. 1e).
CA45-EBOV GP interactions. The CA45 epitope on GP
observed in the crystal structure was predominantly located in
and around the fusion loop stem, made up of strand β19–β20
positioned along the equatorial GP1–GP2 interface of GP. A

 distinct locus of interaction was also observed between CA45 and
N-terminal residues of the GP1 glycan cap (Fig. 2a, b and below).
Both the heavy and light chains of CA45, including their com-
plementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions
(FRs), mediated interactions across a mostly continuous interface
on GP (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). A total interactive
surface of 1105.7 Å2 was observed on the antibody with a cor-
responding interactive surface of 1104.9 Å2 observed on GP
(Supplementary Table 1). The size of the CA45 interactive surface
on GP exceeded those of all other antibodies that target the
GP1–GP2 interface of GP for which structures were available for
analysis (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). In total, 34 residues on
GP were present at the interface with CA45, 16 on GP1, and 18
on GP2, corresponding to 32% and 68% of the interface,
respectively. Interactions of CA45 with GP thus bridged across
both GP1 and GP2 subunits, consistent with a potential
mechanism of inhibition described previously for antibody 16F6
(Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3)16.
The most extensive interactions between the antibody and GP
were mediated by the 23 amino acid CA45 HCDR3 loop, which
accounted for ~55% of the total contact interface with GP
(Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Table 1). Apical residues of the
HCDR3 loop inserted into the previously defined “DFF”
inhibitor-binding pocket21, located beneath the β19–β20 fusion
loop stem, displacing native GP1 residues D192, F193, and F194,
which were disordered in the structure (Fig. 2a, c and below). The
CA45 interface with GP extended from the DFF pocket to the
outer and upper faces of the β19–β20 fusion loop stem through
additional HCDR3 contacts, as well as through contacts mediated
by residues of the HCDR1 (Fig. 2c). Light chain FR2 and LCDR2
domains in turn mediated interactions toward the disulfide-
bonded base of the fusion loop (Fig. 2d). Although CA45’s
interactions with GP1 were predominantly located within the
DFF cavity, additional interactions with this subunit were also
observed above the fusion loop stem and with the N-terminus of
the glycan cap (Fig. 2a, b, d and Supplementary Fig. 2 and below).

 Four residues on GP were previously shown to specifically
ablate CA45 binding in alanine scan saturation mutagenesis
analyses, one on GP1—R64—and three on GP2—Y517, G546,
and N5507. All four of these residues were observed to lie within
the CA45-GP interface in the present structure, with Y517
present within the DFF inhibitor-binding pocket, R64 on the
lower outer edge of the pocket, and G546 present on the outer
face of the β20 fusion loop strand (Fig. 2b–d and below). Residue
N550 was only partially buried by the antibody and its side chain
pointed away from the antibody interface, although interactions
with its backbone were observed (Fig. 2d). We note that the more
limited interactions of CA45 with residue N550 were consistent
with previous observations that N550D or N550Q substitutions in
EBOV GP had benign effects on CA45 binding7.
Previous studies also defined CA45 viral escape variants, which
in all cases contained both the A101V and K588R mutations in
GP, and in two additional cases also contained the N643D or
A654T mutations in the GP2 stalk (not present in the crystallized
construct)7. Residue A101 in the present structure was found
deep within the DFF inhibitor-binding pocket and formed

contacts

(Supplementary Fig. 4). Modeling of the A101V escape mutation
at this position predicts a clash would form with CA45 F100a,
consistent with disruption of antibody binding and viral escape
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Residue K588 was present outside of the
CA45-GP interface and its effect on CA45 escape could not be
directly explained by the structure. We note that despite the
relatively large CA45 epitope on GP defined by the structure, few
residues within the epitope itself have thus far been reported to
lead to viral escape and appear to arise only with accompanying
mutations—possibly indicating a higher bar for viral escape from
this antibody.
Structural basis for broad ebolavirus neutralization by CA45.
The present structure of CA45 bound to GP represents the first
reported crystal structure of a GP1–GP2 interface-binding anti-
body with near pan-ebolavirus neutralizing capacity bound to GP.
As such, we sought to establish a structural basis for its cross-
recognition and breadth relative to other structurally defined
GP1–GP2 interface-binding antibodies and inhibitors6,8,16–18,21–
24. We compared the Shannon sequence entropies (H) of GP
residues at the interface with CA45 against those at the inter-
faces of other antibodies and inhibitors (Fig. 3a, b)25. Shannon
sequence entropy, a measure of sequence variation, was deter-
mined for each GP residue position based on alignment of 236
unique ebolavirus GP sequences determined from a database of
1422 sequences26. At the time of writing, this database was
composed of 1370 sequences of EBOV GP, 20 of SUDV GP, 7 of
BDBV GP, 22 of RESTV GP, and 3 of TAFV (Supplementary
Table 2). The lower the sequence entropy of a residue, the more
conserved the residue, with an entropy of 0 representing full
conservation.
Examination of the sequence entropies of the 34 GP residues of
the CA45 epitope revealed an average entropy of 0.12 for each GP
residue at the antibody binding interface and an average entropy
of 0.008 when normalized by the degree to which each epitope
residue’s surface was buried by the antibody (Fig. 3b). These
entropy values were lower than those of any other neutralizing
antibody analyzed, either as mean entropy per residue or
normalized by residue buried surface, consistent with pan-
efficacy of the antibody (Fig. 3b). Mean sequence entropies of the
binding interfaces of the pan-ebolavirus small-molecule inhibitors
toremifene and ibuprofen were ~0.11 per residue each, similar if
slightly lower than CA45’s average entropy of 0.12 per residue.
When normalized by individual residue buried surface, however,
their mean entropies increased relative to CA45’s, due in part to
their comparatively smaller binding interfaces (Fig. 3b and
Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3 and below).
To further establish the structural basis for breadth of CA45
recognition, we examined sequence variation at each of the 34
CA45 epitope residue positions across the ebolavirus genus
(Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Table 2). Twenty out of 34 epitope
residues had sequence entropies of 0 and were fully conserved
across all examined ebolavirus GP sequences (Fig. 3c, d). An
additional three residue positions (211, 213, 545), which each had
entropies of 0.04, differed in only 1 variant each suggesting
sequence conservation of > 99.5% at these three positions across
the genus (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Table 2). The remaining
11 positions of the epitope exhibited more consistent discrete
differences between species, with sequence entropies that ranged
from 0.10 to 0.60 (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Table 2).
Antibody breadth of recognition can be achieved either
through phylogenetic conservation of epitope residues, in many
cases due to functional or structural constraints, or through
antibody tolerance of sequence variation, or through a combina-
tion of both. In the case of CA45, we utilized previously reported
alanine scan saturation mutagenesis data in the context of EBOV
GP7 to assess CA45 sensitivity to mutation within both conserved
and non-conserved epitope residue positions. Of the four
mutations that result in near complete specific ablation of
CA45 recognition, R64, Y517, G546, and N550, the latter three
are fully conserved across all ebolaviruses, while the former, R64,
is strictly mutated only to a phsyicochemically similar lysine
across the genus (Fig. 3e). Alanine mutation at three additional
epitope residues, E103, L515, and W518, also knocked out CA45

 binding, although these positions were also sensitive to control
mAb recognition, suggesting they could be important for overall
GP integrity or folding7. Nevertheless, all three of these residues
also belonged to the set of fully conserved epitope residues with
zero sequence entropy. Thus, with the exception of R64 (which
only varied to a lysine), CA45 epitope residues that were sensitive
to alanine mutation were found fully conserved across the genus,
potentially due to functional or structural constraints, while
mutations at less conserved epitope positions were largely
tolerated by the antibody, both factors likely contributing to the
antibody’s breadth.
Of the ebolaviruses, CA45 neutralizes BDBV with greatest
potency (IC50 0.9–2.8 nM), followed by EBOV (IC50 3–4.4 nM)
and SUDV (IC50 3.3–12 nM)7. It neutralizes RESTV approxi-
mately tenfold less well (IC50 42 nM) and is completely
refractory to TAFV neutralization7. Although all ebolaviruses
were identical in sequence at the 20 epitope residue positions
described above, they differed to varying degrees at other

 epitope positions (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Table 2). To
assess whether these sequence differences could account for the
more pronounced differences in antibody efficacy observed
against
RESTV
and
TAFV
species,
we
examined
their
analogous CA45 interfaces in greater detail. In the case of
RESTV, in isolates used for functional analysis, five epitope
residue positions—187, 514, 516, 544, and 547—were found to
vary to amino acids that were not observed in any other bound
species (Fig. 3d, f and Supplementary Table 2). Although none
of these five residues led to ablation of CA45 recognition when
mutated to alanine in the context of EBOV GP7, indicative of at
least some degree of antibody tolerance for mutation at these
positions, several antibody residues that formed an interface
with these positions were in fact sensitive to alanine mutation.
These included heavy chain residues G31, Y32, Y33 within the
HCDR1 and residue I100e within the HCDR3. The sensitivity
of these antibody residues to mutation was therefore consistent
with possible relevance of this interface for reduced antibody
recognition and efficacy against RESTV—whose GP differs
from other ebolaviruses at this interface (Fig. 3f).

 In the case of TAFV, which is refractory to CA45 binding and
neutralization, seven residues within its analagous CA45 epitope
differed from those in EBOV GP (Fig. 3c, d, f). Six of these
residues were identical to those found in BDBV—a species bound
and neutralized well by CA457. Only a glutamate at position 549
was found to be distinct in TAFV, present as a histidine in all
other ebolaviruses. Residue H549 in the current structure is
situated to mediate a putative salt bridge with CA45 heavy chain
residue D101—an antibody residue that is highly sensitive to
alanine mutation in the context of EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV GP
(Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 5)7. Although an acidic H549E
substitution, as present in TAFV GP, would be expected to
disrupt this salt bridge, experimental evidence indicates that
neither H549E nor H549A substitutions in the context of EBOV
GP abrogate CA45 binding (Supplementary Fig. 5)7. Thus,
although the absence of this salt bridge in the context of TAFV
may contribute to loss of antibody binding, there are likely
additional factors at play within TAFV that preclude CA45
recognition.
Comparison with other neutralizing antibodies and inhibitors.
To further pinpoint residues and domains on ebolavirus GP that
distinguished CA45 recognition, we investigated the degree to
which its binding site on GP overlapped or diverged from the
binding sites of other antibodies and inhibitors that target the
GP1–GP2 interface. We utilized available structures of GP in
complex with antibodies c4G7, c2G4, KZ52, 16F6, and mAb-100,
and in complex with the pan-reactive small-molecule inhibitors
toremifene and ibuprofen (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2)
6,8,16–18,21–24. This analysis revealed that the CA45-binding site
on GP shared the most residues in common with the binding site
of the small-molecule inhibitor toremifene, overlapping at 15
residues, followed by overlap with the binding site of the ZMapp
antibody c4G7, overlapping at 13 GP residues (Fig. 4a, b).
Overlap with the binding sites of the other ligands ranged from 12
(ibuprofen) to only 1 residue (mAb-100) (Fig. 4a, b). Although
the shared interface residues of CA45 and the small-molecule
inhibitors were split roughly equally across GP1 and GP2, the
shared interface residues with the other antibodies were pre-
dominantly localized to GP2 (Fig. 4b).
To quantitatively assess the relationship between the CA45
epitope on GP with those of the other antibodies and ligands, we
undertook a pairwise regression analysis of the buried surface
areas of their shared GP interface residues (Fig. 4c, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2, and Supplementary Table 3). Although partially
dependent on the differing resolutions of the available structures
(ranging from 2.7-6.7 Å) and the number of intersecting interface
residues, pairwise linear regressions of the shared residue log
transformed buried surface areas yielded statistically significant
positive correlations between the GP-binding sites of CA45 and
the inhibitors toremifene and ibuprofen, with p-values < 0.0001
and 0.0041, respectively (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 2, and
Supplementary Table 3). Statistically significant relationships
were not observed with antibody c4G7, nor with any other
antibody analyzed (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary
Table 3).
To determine whether the intersection in binding sites of CA45
and the small-molecule inhibitors could be manifested experimen-
tally, we undertook an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) competition binding assay between CA45 and the more
potent inhibitor toremifene. Concentrations of toremifene ranging
from 100 to 0.78 μM were premixed with a constant amount of
CA45 IgG and then incubated with captured recombinant EBOV
GPΔMuc. Experiments were performed at both pH 7.4 and 5.2, as
well as with a control antibody FVM04 that recognizes a
conformational epitope in the receptor-binding region of GP5,19.
As shown in Fig. 4d, toremifene was able to effectively compete
with CA45 for binding to GP with IC50s of 6.2 and 5.5 μM at pHs
7.4 and 5.2, respectively. Toremifene did not inhibit binding of
antibody FVM04 to GP, at either pH, suggesting its effects were
specific to the CA45-binding site and did not extend more globally
to the receptor-binding region of GP (Fig. 4d).
GP inhibitor-binding cavity as a site of immune vulnerability.
Given the intersection in the GP-binding sites of CA45 and the
small-molecule inhibitors, as well as their competitive binding, we
compared their respective structural modes of interaction with
GP (Fig. 5). Toremifene and ibuprofen, as well as others that
belong to a larger class of estrogen receptor modulators, bind
within the DFF cavity and are reported to inhibit virus–cell
membrane fusion by destabilizing GP in a pH-dependent man-
ner, possibly by premature triggering21,23,24,27,28. In unliganded
GP, the DFF cavity is occupied by its namesake GP1 residues
D192, F193, and F194 that create a lid (the “DFF lid”) that
protects hydrophobic residues that line the cavity21. The DFF lid
is expelled from the cavity upon binding of the inhibitors.
In the present structure, we observed that binding of CA45 to
GP and insertion of its HCDR3 into the DFF cavity also displaced
the native GP1 D192, F193, and F194 residues, which were
disordered in the structure (Fig. 5a, b). Superposition of the
unliganded structure of GP onto the CA45-bound structure
revealed remarkable molecular mimicry on the part of the
antibody in its interactions within the cavity. As shown in Fig. 5c,
d the mode of binding of CA45 HCDR3 apical residues I100 and
F100a was highly similar to that of native DFF lid GP1 residues
F193 and F194 within the cavity, especially when comparing
placement of the aromatic side chains of F194 of GP1 and F100a
of CA45 (Fig. 5c, d). Consistent with this observation, alanine
substitution of F100a in CA45 has previously been shown to lead
to nearly complete loss of antibody binding to EBOV, SUDV, and
BDBV GP7. Superposition of the structures of inhibitor-bound
GP onto the CA45-bound structure also revealed remarkable
overlap in placement of apical residues of the CA45 HCDR3 and
the small-molecule inhibitors, more markedly for toremifene
(Fig. 5e, f). Indeed, CA45 contacted many of the same set of
residues contacted by the inhibitors within this cavity (Fig. 4c and
Supplementary Fig. 2).
These results implicate the DFF pan-ebolavirus inhibitor-
binding cavity as a bona fide site of broad immune vulnerability
on GP. Saturation mutagenesis analyses previously identified
residues R64, Y517, and G546, as necessary for CA45 binding,
and we observe all them at the CA45 interface near or within the
DFF cavity (Figs. 3e and 5). Likewise, residue A101, which was
shown to be associated with viral escape from CA45, was found
deep within the DFF cavity and formed interactions with the apex
of the CA45 HCDR3 (Figs. 3e and 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4)7.
We note that residues L554 and L558 that line the DFF cavity in
the prefusion state of GP, and form interactions with the DFF lid,
with the inhibitors, and with CA45, are found at the N-terminus
of the N-heptad helix of the six helix bundle in postfusion GP2,
partially buried within its core (Supplementary Fig. 7)29. These
and other interactions of CA45 within the DFF cavity and
additional interactions along the outer and upper faces of the
fusion loop stem may interfere with proper fusion loop release or
transition of GP to the postfusion state. We note that although
the overall architecture of the cavity is present within marburg-
viruses, significant differences are observed both in residues
within the cavity as well as in structural domains that protect it,
which both likely contribute to lack of CA45 recognition of
marburgvirus GP (Supplementary Fig. 8).

 Structural determinants for somatic selection of CA45. CA45 is
encoded by cynomolgus macaque heavy chain germline genes
IGHV4S17, IGHD3S23, and IGHJ6, and light chain germline
genes IGKV1-5 and IGKJ47. Its VH and VL genes are somatically
mutated by 9.9% and 7.5% on the nucleotide level, respectively
(~14% each on the amino acid level), and the VH region has a
deletion of germline residue G31GL within the HCDR1 (Fig. 6).
Inferred germline reversion analyses of these precursor genes has
previously shown that heavy and light reversion (CA45-HGL-LGL)
leads to loss of binding of CA45 to GPΔmuc but not to cleaved
GPcl7. This phenotype was shown to be caused by the G31GL
deletion in the HCDR1 in that its re-insertion into mature CA45
ablates binding to GPΔmuc but not to GPcl7.
To address the structural basis for somatic selection of this
deletion in the CA45 heavy chain, we examined its placement in
the structure (Fig. 6). Residue G31GL lies immediately down-
stream of heavy chain FR1, which, in conjunction with heavy
chain FR3, forms a cradle that interacts with the N-terminus of

 the glycan cap. In the absence of a deletion at G31GL, the FR1
loop that forms part of this cradle would likely extend into the
glycan cap and disrupt antibody binding—a disruption that
would not occur in the context of GPcl that lacks a glycan cap.
Thus, selection of a deletion at G31GL was likely necessitated to
accommodate antibody binding to an uncleaved ectodomain with
an intact glycan cap.
By enabling the interaction between CA45 and the full GP
ectodomain, the deletion of germline residue G31GL may have
also facilitated additional CA45 functions. Namely, CA45 has
been suggested to partially inhibit host endosomal cathepsin
proteolytic cleavage of GP1, which is required for NPC1-C
receptor binding and entry7. The cathepsin cleavage loop of GP
spans roughly 20 residues of GP1 (188–210) and connects the
undercarriage of GP1, beneath the fusion loop stem, to the glycan
cap domain (Fig. 6a). This loop is cleaved by host cathepsins
upon virus trafficking to late endosomes, and although residues
188–209 of the cleavage loop were disordered in the present
structure, both of its termini were found closely associated with
the antibody (Fig. 6a)30,31. GP1 residues L184, L186, and P187
that lead into the loop formed an interface with the HCDR3 of
the antibody, while at the opposite end, antibody heavy chain FR1
and FR3 regions interacted with residues 211–213 of the glycan
cap (Fig. 6a–c). The latter interactions, as noted above, were likely
enabled by deletion of germline residue G31GL. CA45 thus
directly bridged both ends of the cathepsin loop, positioning

 the antibody to contribute to its reported hindrance of loop
cleavage7.
Taken together, our results define a highly conserved epitope
on the fusion loop of ebolavirus GP, at the GP1–GP2 interface,
through
which
broad
antibody-mediated
neutralization
of
ebolaviruses can occur. Phylogenetic conservation of critical
residues of the epitope, as well as apparent tolerance for mutation
elsewhere, are consistent with antibody breadth and lower
likelihood for viral escape. The structural definition of residues
on ebolavirus GP that confer cross-protection, as elucidated here,
provides a template for design of vaccines and immunother-
apeutics aimed at conferring similar protective breadth. The
concurrent dependence on moieties in both GP1 and GP2 for
recognition suggests this target may have the additional benefit of
circumventing diversion from soluble forms of GP secreted
during active infection.
Methods
Protein expression and purification. A codon optimized gene corresponding to
Zaire EBOV strain Mayinga-76 GP (EBOV GPΔMuc) was synthesized through an
outside vendor (Genscript, Inc.) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The construct possessed
deletions of its mucin-like and transmembrane domains, an added leader sequence,
along with C-terminal strep and polyhistidine tags. The gene was subcloned into
vector pcDNA3.1 for transient expression in mammalian cells.
Transient expression of EBOV GPΔMuc was undertaken in HEK293S GNTI
−/− (ATCC) cells using 293fectin transfection reagent according to manufacturer’s
guidelines (Thermo). EBOV GPΔMuc was in all cases co-transfected with a furin
expression construct at 30% ratio. Secreted GP protein was harvested from
supernatants and purified using Complete His Purification Resin (Roche) followed
by Streptactin Resin purification (IBA Biosciences). The GP protein was further
purified by SEC Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/600 column in 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM
Tris-Cl pH 7.5 and 0.02% NaN3.
CA45 IgG was expressed in HEK-293F (ATCC) cells by co-transfecting its
heavy and light chain expression plasmids using 293Fectin and Freestyle media
(Thermofisher). The IgG was purified from supernatants using Protein A Resin
(Roche) and eluted using a low pH Protein A elution buffer (Pierce) followed by
immediate neutralization with Tris base pH 9.0. CA45 Fab was produced from
purified IgG using papain cleavage (Pierce).
EBOV GPΔMuc-CA45 Fab complex crystallization. CA45 Fab was added to GP
at 1.1-fold molar excess and purified by SEC. Protein complex composition was
confirmed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Crystallization of the com-
plexes was undertaken by initial robotic screening using 576 conditions from
commercially available screens (Hampton Research; Rigaku Reagents). Crystal-
lization trays were set up using a Mosquito Nanoliter Liquid Handling System (TTP
Labtech). Crystals were obtained in a condition made up of 1 M Potassium Sodium
Tartrate, 0.1 M MES pH 6.0, and were manually optimized for synchrotron data
collection.
Structure determination and analysis. X-ray diffraction data were processed with
the XDS Software Package32. Frames from nine crystals were merged with CCP4
Blend33. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser with
PDB ID 5JQ3 as a search model for GP and PDB ID 3Q6G as a search model for
the antibody20. The structure was refined using Phenix34 with iterative model
building in Coot35 utilizing 2fofc, fofc, and composite omit electron density maps.
Interactive buried surface areas were determined using Pisa36. All graphical images
were prepared with Pymol (PyMOL Molecular Graphics System). X-ray diffraction
data were collected at SER-CAT ID-22 beamlines of the Advanced Photon Source
(Argonne, IL).
Figures of footprints of antibodies and inhibitors onto CA45-bound GP were
determined by superimposing their corresponding GP structures (PDB IDs: 5JQ7,
5JQB, 3CSY, 5KEL, 5KEN, 5FHC, 3S88) onto CA45-bound GP. Mapping of atoms
on GP within 4.5 Å of the docked antibodies and inhibitors was undertaken with
Pymol.
GP buried surface areas by residue for antibodies and inhibitors were determined
in Pisa solely using coordinates of their respective PDB IDs (5JQ7, 5JQB, 3CSY, 5KEL,
5KEN, 5FHC, 3S88)36. Statistical correlations between buried surface areas (log

 transformed) of shared epitope residues of CA45 and other antibodies and inhibitors
were determined by testing the null hypothesis that they were independent. The null
hypothesis was that the correlations were zero (no correlation), and the alternative
hypothesis that correlations were thus non-zero. For the four antibodies tested against
CA45, the results did not reject the null hypothesis. For the two inhibitors, the null
hypothesis was rejected by a significant p-value, supporting the possibility they had a
positive correlation with CA45. Statistical tests and results for this analysis were

entropies. Sequence entropies were mapped onto the GP trimer in Pymol by
replacing B-factors with Shannon entropy. Mean entropy per residue BSA was
calculated by dividing each epitope residue’s entropy value by its respective anti-
body buried surface area, followed by mean calculation. Sequence logos were
produced using WebLogo337 with a set of 21 unique sequences representing out-
breaks (10 EBOV, 7 SUDV, 2 BDBV, 1 RESTV and 1 TAFV) obtained from the Los
Alamos HFV/Ebola Database (https://hfv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/NEWALIGN/

Competition ELISA assay. EBOV GPΔMuv at 200 ng per well in 100 μL of
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 was incubated overnight at 4°C in Nunc
MaxiSorp Plates. The plates were washed and then blocked in PBS pH
7.4 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2% non-fat dry milk powder
(Difco) for 1 h at room temperature. For the pH 7.4 ELISA assay, all subsequent
washes were undertaken with wash buffer composed of PBS pH 7.4 supplemented
with 0.05% tween-20. For the pH 5.2 ELISA assay, all subsequent washes were
undertaken with wash buffer composed of 0.05 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, 150 mM
sodium chloride, 0.05% tween-20. A series of 1:1 toremifene dilutions were prepared
in a separate non-binding 96 well plate in either PBS pH 7.4 with 10% dimethyl-
sulfoxide (DMSO) or in 0.05 M sodium acetate pH 5.2, 150 mM sodium chloride with
10% DMSO. In all cases, a constant amount of antibody at 0.4 μg/mL was present. 100
μl of the mixture was transferred to the GP-captured wells in each corresponding pH.
After 1 h, the plates were washed and incubated for 1 h with a 1:2500 dilution of
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human secondary antibody
(Jackon ImmunoResearch #109-035-003) in 100 µL blocking buffer per well. The
ELISAs were resolved using Bio-Rad TMB ELISA substrate and stopped using 1 N
sulfuric acid.
