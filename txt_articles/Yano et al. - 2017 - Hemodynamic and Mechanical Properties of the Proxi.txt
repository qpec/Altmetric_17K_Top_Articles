solated systolic hypertension (ISH), defined as systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) ≥140 mm Hg and diastolic BP (DBP) <90 
mm Hg, is a common hypertension subtype in young and mid-
dle-aged adults.1–3 The prevalence has been increasing during 
the past decade in the United States.1–3 Nevertheless, whether 
ISH in young and middle-aged adults represents pseudo or 
spurious hypertension is debated.4–6 We have recently shown 
that in Americans <50 years of age, ISH was associated with 
an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality compared 
with optimal BP.7 However, the pathophysiology of ISH in 
those <50 years of age is incompletely elucidated.4–6
An abnormal relationship between aortic flow and 
pressure has been demonstrated in older adults with high 
SBP.8,9 Stiffening of the proximal aortic wall contributes to 
an exaggerated rise in SBP, which may be offset by aortic 
remodeling, via which the diameter of the aorta increases 
(so-called outward remodeling). If this outward remodel-
ing does not occur, the characteristic impedance of the aorta 
(Zc) increases.8–10 Zc is an index of aortic stiffness relative 
to aortic size. Higher Zc has been reported in older hyper-
tensive adults with wide pulse pressure.8,9,11–14 However, the 
Zc–ISH association remains to be characterized in young and 
middle-aged adults.
The DHS (Dallas Heart Study) is a community-based 
cohort; investigators conducted a comprehensive assessment 
of aortic structure and function using cardiovascular magnetic 
resonance (CMR). Using data from the DHS, we assessed Zc 
in young and middle-aged adults with ISH. We also assessed 
whether the Zc–ISH association differs between participants 
18 to 49 years of age and those 50 to 64 years of age.
Abstract—The aim of this study was to assess characteristic impedance (Zc) of the proximal aorta in young and middle-
aged individuals with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). Zc is an index of aortic stiffness relative to aortic size. In 
the Dallas Heart Study, 2001 untreated participants 18 to 64 years of age (mean age: 42.3 years; 44% black race) were 
divided into the following groups based on office blood pressure (BP) measurements: (1) optimal BP (systolic BP 
[SBP] <120 mm Hg and diastolic BP [DBP] <80 mm Hg; n=837); (2) prehypertension (SBP 120–139 mm Hg and DBP 
80–89 mm Hg; n=821); (3) ISH (SBP ≥140 mm Hg and DBP <90 mm Hg; n=121); (4) isolated diastolic hypertension 
(SBP <140 mm Hg and DBP ≥90 mm Hg; n=44); and (5) systolic–diastolic hypertension (SBP ≥140 mm Hg and DBP 
≥90 mm Hg; n=178). Zc, aortic arch pulse wave velocity, and minimum ascending aortic size were quantified using 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance. In multivariable-adjusted linear models, Zc was highest in the ISH group compared 
with the optimal BP, isolated diastolic hypertension, or systolic–diastolic hypertension groups (103.2±4.0 versus 
68.3±2.1, 75.4±6.0, and 88.9±4.8 dyne*seconds/cm5, respectively; all P<0.05). The Zc–ISH association did not differ 
by race. Aortic pulse wave velocity was highest in the ISH group compared with the optimal BP, isolated diastolic 
hypertension, or systolic–diastolic hypertension groups (6.3±0.3 versus 4.3±0.1, 4.4±0.4 and 5.5±0.3 m/s, respectively; 
all P<0.05), whereas aortic size was similar across groups (all P>0.2). Results were similar in a subgroup of 1551 
participants 18 to 49 years of age. In a multiracial population-based sample, we found evidence of a mismatch between 
proximal aortic stiffness and diameter in young and middle-aged adults with ISH.  (Hypertension. 2017;70:158-165.

Methods
The DHS is a multiracial and multiethnic (black, white, and 
Hispanic), probability-based population study, recruiting Dallas (TX, 
USA) County residents 18 to 64 years of age. Details of the DHS 
have been described previously.15 Briefly, the DHS phase 1 consisted 
of 3 sequential visits between 2000 and 2002, including 2 home visits 
and a clinic visit. During the first 2 visits, a survey was conducted 
through a face-to-face interview, and self-reported ethnicity was 
obtained. In the third visit, 2795 participants underwent CMR imag-
ing studies.16 All participants provided written informed consent, and 
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center institutional 
review board approved the protocol.
BP Measurements and BP Phenotype Definitions
After 5 minutes of rest in seated position, trained medical staff 
obtained 5 BP measurements with 1-minute intervals, using the 
appropriate cuff size in the office setting. The average of 5 BP read-
ings was used for the current analyses. An automated oscillometric 
device (Series #52,000; Welch Allyn, Arden, NC) was used.17 Staffs 
were trained to choose the appropriate cuff size for each participant 
and wrap the cuff around the arm with the center of the bladder over 
the brachial artery.
Participants were classified into 5 mutually exclusive categorical 
BP groups: (1) the optimal BP group (SBP <120 mm Hg and DBP 
<80 mm Hg); (2) the prehypertension group (SBP 120–139 mm Hg 
and DBP 80–89 mm Hg, SBP 120–139 mm Hg and DBP <80 mm Hg, 
or SBP <120 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg); (3) the ISH group; (4) 
the isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) group (SBP <140 mm Hg 
and DBP ≥90 mm Hg); and (5) the systolic–diastolic hypertension 
(SDH) group (SBP ≥140 mm Hg and DBP ≥90 mm Hg).18 Mean arte-
rial pressure was defined as (SBP+2×DBP)/3 and pulse pressure as 
SBP minus DBP. To exclude confounding influence of antihyperten-
sive drugs on aortic structure and function, participants who received 
antihypertension medication were excluded in this study.
Variable Definitions
Data on smoking, physical activity, medication use, clinical history of 
cardiovascular disease, and fasting laboratory values were collected 
using standardized protocols.15 Physical activity was assessed based on 
self-reported frequency and type of leisure-time physical activity, which 
were converted to metabolic equivalent units and reported as metabolic 
equivalent unit-min/wk.19 Estimated glomerular filtration rate was cal-
culated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 
formula.20 Details of the assessment of visceral fat using magnetic reso-
nance imaging are described in the online-only Data Supplement.
Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance
Participants underwent CMR using a 1.5 T whole-body system 
(Intera; Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands), with a 4-ele-
ment surface array coil. Four BP measurements were obtained dur-
ing CMR examinations and used to calculate CMR-derived measures 
(online-only Data Supplement). Ascending aortic distensibility and 
aortic arch pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed using a breath-
hold, velocity-encoded, phase-contrast gradient echo sequence; the 
images were acquired perpendicular to the course of the ascending 
aorta 4 cm above the aortic valve plane.21 The ascending aorta was 
imaged in cross-section with the following conditions: temporal res-
olution of < 40 ms; 256×256 matrix; 34-cm field of view; 20° flip 
angle; 10 ms repetition time; 5 ms echo time; through-plane velocity 
encoding of ±150 cm/s; and slice thickness of 8 mm. The images 
were acquired using prospective ECG gating. The time–velocity 
curve was interpolated to a temporal resolution of 10 ms by using a 
cubic spline for analysis. The aortic arch was also evaluated with an 
oblique sagittal, double inversion-recovery spin echo image (candy 
cane view) with the following conditions: 33 cm field of view; elec-
trocardiographically gated repetition time; 5.3 ms echo time; and 
32 echo train length. The images were analyzed using the MASS/
FLOW (Medis, Leiden, Netherlands).22 Area contour of the ascend-
ing aorta was automatically traced through all phases of the cardiac 
cycle, and its maximum and minimum cross-sectional areas were 
measured. Minimum ascending aortic area was defined as aortic size 
in this study. The operator assessing the area contours was blind to 
participant’s clinical characteristics. Details of our technique have 
been described previously.16
Calculation of Zc and Aortic Arch PWV
Time–velocity flow curves of the ascending and descending 
aorta were produced using MASS/FLOW (Medis, Leiden, The 
Netherlands). Transit time was calculated as the time difference 
between the ascending and descending upstroke velocities at half-
maximum velocity. Arch distance was determined by drawing a free-
hand line through the center of the aorta between the ascending and 
descending aorta position where flow measurements were made.13 
Aortic arch PWV (d/t) was calculated by dividing arch distance (d) 
by transit time (t), with larger velocities indicating greater aortic stiff-
ness.23 Aortic arch PWV was also estimated using the Bramwell–Hill 
equation.24 The Pearson correlation between flow-based PWV and 
Bramwell–Hill–based PWV was 0.51 (P<0.0001). Zc is a measure 
of the opposition of the circulation to oscillatory flow input. We esti-
mated Zc, by using the water hammer equation, as the product of 
aortic arch PWV and blood density divided by the ascending aortic 
area in diastole. Blood density was assumed to be fixed at 1.06 g/
cm3 as previously described.13,25 Details of the assessments of ascend-
ing aortic distensibility and compliance, stroke volume, and systemic 
vascular resistance are described in the online-only Data Supplement.
Analytic Sample
Of the 2759 participants, we excluded 196 participants whose CMR 
image quality was missing or insufficient for interpretation, 166 par-
ticipants with prevalent cardiovascular disease, and 396 participants 
who received antihypertensive medication, leaving a sample of 2001 
participants for analysis.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics are presented as mean and SD or proportion 
where appropriate. Multiple pairwise comparisons of the demo-
graphic variables and clinical characteristics among the categorical 
BP groups were conducted using Jonckheere-Terpstra or Fisher exact 
tests. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were used to 
compare CMR-derived measures (as continuous variables) across the 
categorical BP groups; P values were obtained by Bonferroni multi-
ple pairwise comparison tests. The primary exposure was ISH (versus 
other BP categories). The primary outcome was Zc, and secondary 
outcomes included other CMR-derived measures, such as aortic arch 
PWV, aortic distensibility and compliance, aortic size, stroke volume, 
and systemic vascular resistance. Possible violations of the assump-
tions of multiple linear regression were examined by visual inspection 
of the distribution of residuals through both histograms and normal 
probability plots. We further checked for deviations of linearity and 
homoscedasticity by visually inspecting scatterplots of standardized 
residuals by standardized predicted values. In addition, we assessed 
variance inflation factors to examine the possibility of multicollinear-
ity, and values >4 were considered to indicate collinearity. Covariates 
included demographic variables: age, sex, and race and clinical char-
acteristics: height, weight, heart rate, smoking, physical activity, total 
cholesterol, fasting glucose, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. 
These covariates were selected a priori because they have known cor-
relations with BP levels18 and aortic impedance.26 We also assessed 
whether the associations between ISH and outcomes were attenuated 
after adjustment for mean arterial pressure and visceral fat, known 
potential contributors to cardiovascular risk in people with ISH.4–6 
Next, analyses for heterogeneity of effect between ISH and outcomes 
by age (<50 or ≥50 years) or race (black or nonblack individuals) 
were performed, with inclusion of additive interaction terms. Finally, 
although the categorical BP groups are a clinically relevant classifi-
cation,18 this approach may be arbitrary. Therefore, we assessed the 
continuous association between pulse pressure and CMR-derived 
measures in separate models. All statistical analyses were performed 
with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Statistical signifi-
cance was defined by a P value <0.05 using 2-sided tests.

Results
Demographic variables and clinical characteristics by the cat-
egorical BP groups are shown in Table 1. Of the included 2001 
participants, 6% (n=121) were classified as the ISH group, 2% 
(n=44) as the IDH group, and 9% (n=178) as the SDH group. 
In the ISH group, half were women (n=64), 64% were blacks 
(n=38), and 36% were 18 to 49 years of age (n=43). Higher 
age, higher proportion of male sex, black race, prevalent dia-
betes mellitus, and higher mean visceral fat were observed in 
the ISH group than the optimal BP group. Resting heart rate

Data are expressed as the means±SD or percentage. Office BP measurements were calculated from the average of 5 BP measures taken during the in-office visit. 
Participants were stratified into 5 mutually exclusive categorical BP groups: (1) optimal BP (SBP <120 mm Hg and DBP <80 mm Hg); (2) prehypertension (SBP 120–139 
mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg, SBP 120–139 mm Hg and DBP <80 mm Hg, or SBP <120 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg); (3) ISH (SBP ≥140 mm Hg and DBP <90 mm Hg); 
(4) IDH (SBP <140 mm Hg and DBP ≥90 mm Hg); and (5) SDH (SBP ≥140 mm Hg and DBP ≥90 mm Hg). Multiple comparisons among BP categories were conducted using 
Jonckheere-Terpstra (for continuous variables) or Fisher exact tests (for categorical variables). P values were obtained by Bonferroni multiple pairwise comparison tests, and 
statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. DBP indicates diastolic blood pressure; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; IDH, isolated diastolic hypertension; ISH,

was similar between the ISH group and the optimal BP group. 
Results were similar in the subgroup of 1551 participants 18 
to 49 years of age (Tables S1 and S2 in the online-only Data 
Supplement). The mean±SD of age for participants 18 to 49 
years of age was 38.5±6.3. For those 50 to 64 years of age, it 
was 55.3±3.9.
Figure shows nonadjusted CMR-derived measures by the 
categorical BP groups. Zc and aortic arch PWV were high-
est in the ISH group. Aortic size was higher, whereas aortic 
distensibility and compliance were lower in the ISH group 
compared with the optimal BP group. Systemic vascular resis-
tance was higher in the ISH group compared with the optimal 
BP group, whereas it was lower when compared with that in 
the SDH group. Stroke volume was similar between the ISH 
group and the optimal BP group, whereas it was lowest in the 
IDH group. Results were consistent across subgroups defined 
by age (<50 or ≥50 years: Figure S2) and race (Figure S3).
Table 2 shows the results of linear regression models 
examining the associations between CMR-derived measures 
in the ISH group and the other categorical BP groups. With 
adjustments for covariates, Zc and aortic arch PWV were high-
est, whereas aortic compliance was lowest in the ISH group 
(model 1 in Table 2). Additional adjustments by visceral fat 
and mean arterial pressure did not change the results (models 2 
and 3 in Table 2). Aortic size in the ISH group was larger than 
that in the optimal BP group but smaller than that in the SDH 
group (model 1 in Table 2). After the model was adjusted for 
mean arterial pressure, the differences in aortic size between 
the ISH group and other categorical BP groups were no longer 
significant (model 3 in Table 2). Results were similar when

aortic arch PWV was estimated using the Bramwell–Hill 
equation (Table S3).
There was an interaction between ISH (versus optimal BP) 
and age (<50 or ≥50 years) in association with Zc and aortic 
arch PWV (all P<0.02). The differences in Zc and aortic arch 
PWV parameters between the ISH group and the optimal BP 
group were greater in participants 50 to 64 years of age than 
in those 18 to 49 years of age (Tables S4 and S5). The interac-
tion term between ISH (versus optimal BP) and race in asso-
ciation with aortic arch PWV, but not with Zc, was significant 
(P=0.04). The difference in aortic arch PWV between ISH 
and optimal BP groups was greater in black compared with 
nonblack individuals (Tables S6 and S7). When we analyzed 
the associations of pulse pressure as a continuous variable 
with CMR-derived measures (Table 3), higher mean arterial 
pressure, greater aortic arch PWV and left ventricular stroke 
volume, and smaller aortic size were each associated with 
higher pulse pressure.
Discussion
There are 3 major findings in this study. First, in this commu-
nity-based multiracial and multiethnic cohort, the ISH group 
had greater Zc and aortic stiffness than the optimal BP, IDH, 
and SDH groups. The differences were independent of mean 
arterial pressure and visceral obesity. The results were simi-
lar when analyzed in individual 18 to 49 years of age only. 
Second, aortic size was similar between the ISH group and the 
other categorical BP groups after adjustment for mean arterial 
pressure, implicating higher aortic stiffness as the predomi-
nant factor for higher Zc in the ISH group. Third, the higher Zc 
seen in the ISH group versus the optimal BP group was more 
significant among participants 50 to 64 years of age than in

Adjusted means (±SE) in CMR-derived measures by each BP group are shown. Each CMR-derived measure was analyzed as the outcome in separate 
models. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were used and multiple pairwise comparisons among the BP groups were conducted. As adjustment 
factors, model 1 included demographic variables (age, sex, and race)+clinical characteristics at visit 3 (height, weight, heart rate, smoking, physical 
activity, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, and eGFR), model 2 included demographic variables+clinical characteristics at visit 3+VAT, and model 3 included 
demographic variables+clinical characteristics at visit 3+VAT+mean arterial pressure. Mean arterial pressure was incorporated in the formula of systemic 
vascular resistance, and therefore, model 3 in systemic vascular resistance did not exist. P values were obtained by Bonferroni multiple pairwise comparison 
tests, and statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. BP indicates blood pressure; CMR, cardiovascular magnetic resonance; DBP, diastolic blood 
pressure; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; IDH, isolated diastolic hypertension; ISH, isolated systolic hypertension; SBP, systolic blood pressure;

those 18 to 49 years of age. The Zc–ISH association did not 
differ by race.
Hemodynamics have been assessed in young adults with 
ISH, and findings have been inconsistent.4–6,27,28 A study 
from the Netherlands demonstrated normal aortic PWV 
with higher pressure amplification in young adults with ISH 
(n=57; mean age 28 years), suggesting ISH in the young as 
a spurious form of hypertension.27 In contrast, a population 
study from the United Kingdom illustrated higher aortic stiff-
ness and cardiac output in young adults with ISH (n=109; 
mean age 20 years) compared with normotensive individu-
als.28 However, these studies have not assessed aortic imped-
ance or size in young adults with ISH. We highlighted that 
among individuals 18 to 49 years of age, Zc was higher in 
the ISH group than in the optimal BP, IDH, and SDH groups. 
Increased Zc has been reportedly associated with adverse car-
diovascular outcomes in a community-based cohort, indepen-
dent of aortic stiffness.29 Further investigation is needed to 
determine whether higher pulsatile arterial pressure driven by 
a mismatch between proximal aortic stiffness and diameter 
contributes to incident cardiovascular disease events in young 
adults with ISH.
A univariate analysis revealed that aortic size was greater 
in the ISH group compared with the optimal BP group. 
However, the aortic size was similar in the ISH group com-
pared with the optimal BP group after adjustments for distend-
ing pressure (ie, mean arterial pressure). Conversely, greater 
aortic arch PWV and lower aortic distensibility in the ISH 
group compared with the optimal BP group persisted even 
after adjustment for mean arterial pressure. This suggests that 
greater proximal aortic stiffness may predominantly contrib-
ute to ISH in young and middle-aged adults. Outward remod-
eling of the proximal aorta may limit increases in pulsatile 
pressure as the aorta stiffens with age.30 This adaptation may 
be limited in young and middle-aged adults with ISH because 
of alterations in aortic mechanical properties.31 Previous stud-
ies in older hypertensive adults have indicated that higher 
pulse pressure was associated both higher wall stiffness and 
smaller aortic diameter.9,13 In our study, higher pulse wave 
velocity, smaller aortic size, and larger stroke volume was also 
significantly associated with higher pulse pressure, suggesting 
a similar pathophysiologic process in elevated pulse pressure 
between young/middle-aged adults and older adults.
Significant interactions were found between age (<50 or 
≥50 years) and ISH (versus optimal BP) in association with Zc 
and aortic arch PWV but not with aortic size. Further investi-
gation is needed to determine whether the pathophysiology of 
ISH differs by age or whether ISH develops on a pathophysi-
ological continuum from young to middle adulthood. Those 
with IDH or SDH were more likely than those with optimal 
BP to have higher systemic vascular resistance. Zc and aortic 
stiffness in the SDH group, but not in the IDH group, were 
higher than in the optimal BP group. Collectively, higher sys-
temic vascular resistance seems to be a major contributor to 
high DBP, whereas aortic stiffness and a mismatch between 
aortic stiffness and diameter are major contributors to high 
SBP. Determining whether ISH in young and middle-aged 
adults has a unique pathophysiology (eg, whether a de novo 
stiffening of the proximal aorta antedates the development of 
peripheral vascular remodeling) is worthy of further research.
Highest Zc was observed in both black and nonblack indi-
viduals in the ISH group. Conversely, the difference in aortic 
arch PWV between the ISH group and the optimal BP group 
was larger in black compared with nonblack individuals. In 
young and middle-aged adults, black individuals are more 
likely than whites to have greater aortic stiffness, independent 
of known cardiovascular risk factors.32,33 In models for aortic 
arch PWV, the difference in PWV between the ISH group and 
the optimal BP group remained unchanged in black individu-
als, even after an adjustment for mean arterial pressure. The 
difference was, however, attenuated in nonblack individu-
als. High aortic stiffness in black individuals with ISH may 
be attributable to factors beyond high BP, including genetic, 
environmental, and neurohumoral factors.34,35
Strengths of this study include the well-characterized, 
community-based multiethnic cohort, participants who 
received antihypertensive medication were excluded, the stan-
dardized data collection protocols of office BP measurements, 
and application of a comprehensive standardized CMR test 
battery. However, there are limitations. First, because this is 
an observational study, we are unable to determine causality in 
the findings. Second, the results require careful interpretation 
because of the small sample size of ISH. Third, we used flow-
based PWV derived from CMR, which might overestimate the 
arrival time of the flow (consequently, underestimating PWV) 
as the pulse wave reflection at more distal locations within the 
aorta blunts the upstroke of flow. However, results were simi-
lar when PWV was estimated using the Bramwell–Hill equa-
tion. Fourth, we used peripheral but not central pulse pressure 
to estimate aortic distensibility. Therefore, aortic compliance 
and distensibility may be underestimated in the optimal BP 
group who are more likely to have lowest central systolic BP 
and pulse pressure. Fifth, trained technicians obtained 5 BP 
readings after participants had been seated for 5 minutes in

single office visit may not be accurate.
Perspectives
Among young and middle-aged adults, individuals with 
ISH have greatest aortic stiffness and mismatch between 
proximal aortic stiffness and diameter than those in other 
BP groups. These findings challenge the classic view that 
ISH in young and middle-aged adults represents pseudo 
or spurious hypertension. Further studies are required to 
determine the biological mechanisms and effective inter-
ventions to improve aortic function in young and middle-
aged adults with ISH.

What Is New?
• In a community-based multiracial and multiethnic cohort, we found evi-
dence of a mismatch between proximal aortic stiffness and diameter in 
young and middle-aged adults with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH).
What Is Relevant?
• ISH is a common hypertension subtype in young and middle-aged adults. 
Nevertheless, whether ISH in young and middle-aged adults represents 
pseudo or spurious hypertension is debated. The pathophysiology of ISH 
in young and middle-aged adults is also incompletely elucidated.
Summary
We highlight that among young and middle-aged adults, individu-
als with ISH have greatest aortic stiffness and mismatch between 
proximal aortic stiffness and diameter than those in other BP 
groups.
