Abstract
Purpose: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are one of
the major contributors to immune suppression in cancer. We
recently have demonstrated in preclinical study that MDSCs are
sensitive to TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) agonist. The goal of this
study was to clinically test the hypothesis that targeting TRAIL-R2
can selectively eliminate MDSCs.
Experimental Design: The TRAIL-R2 agonistic antibody
(DS-8273a) has been tested in 16 patients with advanced cancers
enrolled in a phase I trial. The antibody (24 mg/kg) was admin-
istered intravenously once every 3 weeks till disease progression,
unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. The safety and
the presence of various populations of myeloid and lymphoid
cells in peripheral blood and tumor tissues were evaluated.
Results: The treatment was well tolerated with only mild to
moderate adverse events attributable to the study drug. Treatment
with DS-8273a resulted in reduction of the elevated numbers of
MDSCs in the peripheral blood of most patients to the levels
observed in healthy volunteers. However, in several patients,
MDSCs rebounded back to the pretreatment level by day 42. In
contrast, DS-8273a did not affect the number of neutrophils,
monocytes, and other populations of myeloid and lymphoid
cells. Decrease in MDSCs inversely correlated with the length of
progression-free survival. In tumors, DS-8273a treatment resulted
in a decrease of MDSCs in 50% of the patients who were able to
provide pre- and on-treatment biopsies.
Conclusions: Targeting TRAIL-R2 resulted in elimination
of different populations of MDSCs without affecting mature
myeloid or lymphoid cells. These data support the use of
this antibody in combination immmunotherapy of cancer.

Introduction
It is now well established that the myeloid cells play an
important role in regulation of tumor progression and metas-
tases as well as in limiting the effects of cancer immunotherapy
(1). Consequently, combination of immune checkpoint block-
ade, or T-cell–based immunotherapy including treatment with
chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells, T-cell receptor–
transduced T (TCR-T) cells or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) with therapy that targets the immunosuppressive micro-
environment holds great promise (2, 3). Myeloid-derived sup-
pressor cells (MDSC) represent one of the major immunosup-
pressive populations in cancer patients. They consist of popu-
lations
of
polymorphonuclear
(PMN-MDSC),
monocytic
(M-MDSC), and early precursors (eMDSC; ref. 4). In addition
to their suppressive abilities, MDSCs can also promote tumor
survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis (5). MDSCs accumula-
tion has recently been correlated with tumor burden, as well as
overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence-free sur-
vival in different tumor types (6, 7). Importantly, MDSC
accumulation has been reported to correlate with resistance to
ipilimumab or nivolumab treatment in melanoma (8–13).
Several strategies to target MDSCs have been proposed and
are based on inducing depletion or inhibiting their suppressive
activity, differentiation, or accumulation (14). However, none
of these strategies are specific to MDSCs and many of them
(e.g., chemotherapy) have substantial side effects. We have
recently reported that MDSCs could be selectively targeted in
preclinical settings using TRAIL-R2 agonistic antibody (15).
TNF-related apoptosis induced ligand-receptors (TRAIL-R) are
members of the TNF receptor superfamily and consist of two
death receptors, TRAIL-R1 (DR4/CD261) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5/
CD262), two decoy receptors (DcR1/CD263 and DcR2/CD264),
and one soluble receptor (osteoprotegerin, OPG; refs. 16, 17).
Ligation of TRAIL with DR4 or DR5 induces trimerization of the
receptor, which activates an apoptotic pathway (18). DcR1 is a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein lacking an
intracellular domain, and DcR2 contains a truncated death
domain. These two receptors can prevent TRAIL-induced apopto-
sis by competing with DR4 and DR5 for binding to TRAIL or by
inhibiting apoptosis via formation of ligand-independent com-
plexes between DR5 and DcR2 (19). In mice, agonistic DR5

 antibody potentiated the effect of immune checkpoint blockade
(CTLA-4 targeting antibody), which resulted in a 5-fold decrease
of the tumor growth (15). This suggests that TRAIL-R–targeting
antibody can be potentially used in selective elimination of
MDSCs in cancer patients. We tested this hypothesis in patients
with advanced cancers enrolled in a phase I trial of TRAIL-R2
agonistic antibody DS-8273a.
Materials and Methods
Sample collection and preparation
All samples were collected from patients at Sarah Cannon
Research Institute, University of Alabama Birmingham, and
University of Chicago who were enrolled in the phase I study
registered
at
clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT02076451).
Peripheral
blood was collected from 16 subjects and pre- and on-treat-
ment tumor tissue from 6 subjects with advanced stage solid
tumors. Study was approved by institutional review boards of
participating institutions and all patient samples were collected
with informed consent. Clinical characteristics are described
in Table 1.
Peripheral blood from 6 patients (5 males and 1 females, age
53–82) with stage III head and neck cancer who were not part of
the treatment protocol was collected from Helen F. Graham
Cancer Center. That portion of the study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of the Helen F. Graham Cancer
Center, and The Wistar Institute. The patient samples were
collected with informed consent. Peripheral blood from 12
healthy donors was used as a control and was obtained at the
Wistar Institute in accordance to the institutional review board
protocol. All samples were analyzed within 24 to 36 hours
following collection.
Cell isolation and culture
Human PBMCs were isolated on a Ficoll gradient following
the manufacturer's recommendation (Amersham). Cells were
then cultured in RPMI (Biosource International) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 5 mmol/L glutamine, 25 mmol/L HEPES, 50
mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, and 1% antibiotics (Invitrogen).
For the experiments where myeloid cells were placed in culture,
recombinant GM-CSF was added to the media at a concentra-
tion of 10 ng/mL (PeproTech). For MDSC isolation, PBMCs
and neutrophils were isolated using a histopaque gradient
followed by isolation with CD15 antibody and magnetic beads.
M-MDSCs were sorted by flow cytometry from the PBMCs
depleted
of
PMN-MDSC
after
staining
with
CD14
and
HLA-DR antibodies. The purity of all population was >90%
following isolation.
Suppression assay
T cells from one healthy donor were purified using a human T-
cell enrichment column (R&D) and used as responder cells.
Dendritic cells were generated from adherent monocytes in the
presence of GM-CSF and IL4 (PeproTech; 20 and 10 ng/mL,
respectively) for 6 days as described previously (20) and used as
stimulator cells. Responder and stimulator cells were then mixed
at a 10:1 ratio and different subsets of MDSCs were added at
various ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 MDSCs to T-cell ratio). T-cell
proliferation was assessed after 5 days of culture by thymidine
incorporation.
In vitro killing assay
Human PBMCs and PMNs were isolated by centrifugation over
a double density Histopaque (Sigma Aldrich) gradient (1.077 to
collect PBMC and 1.119 to collect PMN) from cancer patients.

Translational Relevance
This study demonstrates highly selective targeting myeloid-
derived suppressive cells (MDSC) in cancer patients. It is based
on recently discovered preferential sensitivity of MDSCs
to TRAIL receptor targeting. Treatment with new agonistic
TRAIL-R antibody DS-8273a resulted in a temporary reduction
of the elevated numbers of MDSCs in the peripheral blood of
most patients to the levels observed in healthy volunteers. In
contrast, DS-8273a did not affect the number of neutrophils,
monocytes, and other populations of myeloid and lymphoid
cells. Decrease in MDSCs inversely correlated with the length
of progression-free survival. In tumors, DS-8273a treatment
resulted in a decrease of MDSCs in 50% of the patients who
were able to provide pre- and on-treatment biopsies. It opens
an opportunity to regulate tumor microenvironment in
patients to enhance the effect of cancer therapeutics.

 Cells were then culture in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS,
5 mmol/L glutamine, 25 mmol/L HEPES, 50 mmol/L b-mercap-
toethanol, and 1% antibiotics with 10 ng/mL of rhGM-CSF. DS-
8273a was added to culture for overnight incubation followed by
flow cytometry analysis of M-MDSC or PMN-MDSC levels for cell
recovery. In some studies, healthy donor PMN cells were cultured
with or without 1 mmol/L thapsigargin (THG; Sigma Aldrich) for 4
and 24 hours. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for
TRAIL-R3 (DcR1), TRAIL-R4 (DcR2), and DR5 (CD262) expres-
sion at each time point. After 4 hours, DS-8273a was added to
wells at a concentration of 4 mg/mL with or without 2.5 mg/mL of
mouse anti-human IgG1 (Thermo Fisher) to facilitate cross-link-
ing. Cell recovery was assessed using a Countess II FL Automated
Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Flow cytometry
The antibody panels used in this study are described in Sup-
plementary Table S1. FoxP3 staining was performed using the
human FoxP3 buffer set according to the manufacturer's recom-
mendations (BD Biosciences). All flow cytometry data were
acquired using a BD LSR II flow cytometer and analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry
Following deparaffinization and rehydration, heat-induced
antigen retrieval was performed using Tris-EDTA buffer pH 9.
Tissues were stained for S100A9 (Novus Biologicals), CD33
(Novocastra), CD8, Neutrophil Elastase, and CD163 (Abcam).
PD-1 antibody was obtained from R&D Systems. The following
fluorescently conjugated secondary mAbs (Life Technologies)
were used: anti-rabbit IgG AF594 for S100A9 and neutrophil
Elastase, anti-mouse IgG AF647 for CD33, and anti-mouse IgG
AF594 for CD163. Alexa-594 donkey anti-mouse IgG was used for
CD8 and Alexa-647 donkey anti-goat antibody for PD1. Cell
nuclei were stained using DAPI (Life technologies). Images were
obtained using Leica TCS SP5 Confocal microscope. Sixteen
frames at 63� magnification were used to calculate the cell
count/mm2.
IHC staining was performed on a Bond Max automated
staining system (Leica Microsystems). The Bond Refine Polymer
Staining Kit (Leica Microsystems) was used. FoxP3 mAb (Bio-
legend), CD4 mAb (Leica Microsystems), and CD8 mAb
(DAKO) were used and antigen retrieval was performed with
ER2 and ER1 (Leica Microsystems) retrieval solutions. Slides
were rinsed, dehydrated through a series of ascending concen-
trations of ethanol and xylene, and then mounted. Images
were obtained using Nikon E600 Upright Microscope. Twelve
frames at 40� magnification were used to calculate the cell
count/mm2.
Anti-drug antibody detection
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) detection against DS-8273a in the
patient plasma was assayed using an electrochemiluminescent
(ECL) immunoassay in a bridging assay format. Biotin-labeled
(B) and ruthenium-labeled (Ru) DS-8273a were used as capture
and detection reagents for anti-DS-8273a antibodies, and the ECL
signal generated in the assay in the presence of the Ru-DS-8273a/
anti-DS-8273a/B-DS-8273a immune complex was measured
using the Meso-Scale discovery (MSD) PRTM 6000 Plate Reader.
If a sample was tested ADA-positive, a confirmatory test was
performed and considered final.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student t
test (unless otherwise stated), correlation analysis using Spear-
man rank test. GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software
Inc.) and StataMP13 (StataCorp LP) were used and significance
was determined at P < 0.05.
Results
Effect of TRAIL-R2 agonistic antibody on MDSC in vitro
To evaluate the populations of MDSC in PBMCs, we used
previously described criteria (4, 6, 21). MDSCs are comprised of
a mixed population of early-stage precursors and PMN-MDSCs
(eMDSCs) defined as Lin (CD3, 14, 19, 56)�HLA-DR�CD33þ,
PMN-MDSCs defined as CD11bþCD14�CD33þCD15þ cells, and
M-MDSCs defined as CD14þHLA-DR�/lo cells (Fig. 1A). Other
mononuclear cells including various populations of lympho-
cytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells were also evaluated as
described in Supplementary Fig. S1. In this study, all CD15þ
cells present in the PBMC layer were considered as PMN-
MDSCs. There are currently no fully effective methods or
specific markers to distinguish PMN-MDSCs from regular neu-
trophils within the PBMC layer. Because of this fact, we wanted
to verify the suppressive activity all CD15þ cells found in the
PBMC layer from those found in the high-density PMN frac-
tion. This was confirmed in a direct T-cell–suppressive assay
using a three-way allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction using
samples from patients with advanced head and neck cancer that
were not on the treatment protocol. Figure 1B demonstrates
this comparison of suppressive activity of low-density PMN-
MDSCs (PBMC fraction) and high-density neutrophils isolated
from peripheral blood of the same patients.
To target MDSCs in vitro, we used TRAIL-R2 agonistic anti-
body, DS-8273a developed by Daiichi Sankyo Inc. Cells were
isolated from patients with advanced head and neck cancer
that were not on the treatment protocol. DS-8273a at concen-
tration 100 mg/mL and higher caused significant killing of
PMN-MDSCs but not neutrophils from the same patients.
Similar results were observed with M-MDSCs and monocytes
(Fig. 1C).
We have previously implicated ER stress in changes in TRAIL-Rs
expression observed in myeloid cells in cancer (15). We asked
whether ER stress can make control neutrophils sensitive to
DS-8273a. PMNs isolated from healthy donors were cultured
with GM-CSF and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducer
THG. THG induced downregulation of DcR1 and DcR2 on PMN
after 4 hours of incubation. The effect became stronger after 24
hours of incubation (Fig. 1D). Importantly, THG had minimal
effects on the expression of DR5 consistent with changes observed
in human MDSCs in a previous study (15). Incubation of PMN for
24 hours with GM-CSF did not sensitize these cells to DS-8273a.
However, PMN became sensitive to agonistic TRAIL-R2 antibody
after incubation with THG (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that ER
stress–inducible downregulation of DcR1 and DcR2 on MDSCs
make these cells sensitive to the agonistic TRAIL-R2 antibody
DS8273a.
Design of the trial and characterization of MDSCs
targeted by DS-8273a
The effect of DS-8273a was tested in a multicenter two-part
phase I clinical trial NCT02076451 in patients with advanced
solid tumors. The subjects were treated at escalating doses of

 single-agent DS-8273a starting from 2 mg/kg through 8, 16, and
24 mg/kg in the dose escalation part of the study, followed by a
dose expansion part, in which all subjects were treated at the
highest dose of 24 mg/kg once every 3 weeks that showed no dose-
limiting toxicities. The antibody was administered intravenously
every 3 weeks till disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or
withdrawal of consent. The clinical trial demonstrated excellent
safety and tolerability of DS-8273a at all the dose levels tested up
to 24 mg/kg every 3 weeks (manuscript submitted). Evaluation of
the effect of the antibody on MDSCs was performed only in
subjects treated with DS-8273a at 24 mg/kg in the dose escalation
and the dose expansion cohorts (Supplementary Fig. S2). The
mean Cmax at this dose level after the first infusion of DS-8273a
was 621 mg/mL and the Cmin was 132 mg/mL that were both higher
than the minimal concentration observed to be effective in
inducing apoptosis in the MDSCs based on ex vivo experiments
mentioned above.
Blood samples were collected from 18 patients who received
DS-8273a at 24 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Pretreatment samples
from two patients were lost during transportation. Therefore,
16 patients were evaluated (Supplementary Fig. S3). Most of
the patients had stage IV cancer and had failed multiple prior
chemotherapies. No concurrent cancer therapy was adminis-
trated during the treatment with DS-8273a (Table 1). A risk of
ADA formation affecting continued treatment of the antibody
was not identified in the study. Fifteen of the 16 subjects were
ADA-negative at all time points assessed. One patient who
developed ADA positivity discontinued the study due to clin-
ical progression, and without a follow up sample for re-testing
ADA. Pharmacokinetic data showed no appreciable difference

Characterization of MDSCs. A, Phenotype of populations of MDSC evaluated in the study by flow cytometry. Typical example of the analysis of one patient on trial is
shown. B, Suppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs. PMN-MDSCs were isolated from PBMCs and neutrophils (PMN) from high-density fraction of hystopaque gradient
from the same patient followed by magnetic beads isolation with CD15 antibody. Suppressive activity of PMNs and PMN-MDSCs was evaluated in triplicates
in three-way allogeneic MLR. Two patients with HNC cancer (not on trial) were tested and showed similar results. �, P < 0.05 from control (no MDSCs or PMNs added).
C, Effect of DS-8273a on survival of cells. Neutrophils, PMN-MDSCs, monocytes, and M-MDSCs were isolated from four patients with HNC (not on trial). Cells were
cultured for 20 hours with indicated concentration of DS-8273a in the presence of 10 ng/mL rhGM-CSF and viability was assessed by 7AAD staining. �, P < 0.05.
D, Effect of ER stress inducer THG on TRAIL-Rs expression in PMNs. PMNs were isolated from four different healthy donors and treated for 24 hours with
20 ng/mL GM-CSF and 1 mmol/L THG. Cells were then collected and analyzed using indicated markers. P values between control (untreated) and THG-treated PMN
are shown. E, Effect of DS-8273a on THG-treated PMNs. PMNs were isolated from healthy donors and treated with or without 1 mmol/L of THG for 4 hours in the
presence of 10 ng/mL rhGM-CSF followed by the addition of DS-8273a for 24 hours. Untreated cells incubated with media alone, DS-8273a � 4 mg/mL of
antibody, DS-8273a þ anti-IgG � 4 mg/mL DS-8273a and 2.5 mg/mL anti-IgG1 (to enhance cross-linking of primary antibody). P values of statistically significant
differences are shown.

 in the plasma concentrations of DS-8273a between cycle 1 and
cycle 2 (data not shown).
DS-8273a selectively eliminated PMN-MDSCs and eMDSCs in
cancer patients
Samples of blood were collected in heparin tubes at baseline
(prior to the treatment), on day 14, 21 (end of cycle 1), 28, and
42 (end of cycle 2) and shipped overnight on ice for analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Control blood samples from healthy
volunteers were stored on ice overnight to create comparable
conditions. Prior to the beginning of the treatment, patients
had lower number of CD4þ T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK)
cells, and dendritic cells (DC) in comparison with healthy
donors. In contrast, they had higher numbers of neutrophils,
eMDSCs, and PMN-MDSCs (Fig. 2). When various cellular
populations were analyzed in all patients during the treatment,
no significant effect of DS-8273a was observed on lymphocytes,
neutrophils, monocytes, and DCs (Supplementary Fig. S4).
However, a clear trend for a decrease in the numbers of MDSCs
was observed (Supplementary Fig. S4). To better understand
the changes in MDSCs, we separated patients based on their
pretreatment levels of eMDSCs and PMN-MDSCs. In 9 of 16
patients whose peripheral blood was available for analysis, the
MDSC levels were higher than the range established in healthy
individuals, whereas in 7 patients it was within the control
range (Fig. 3A). In patients with elevated numbers of eMDSCs
and PMN-MDSCs, treatment with DS8273a caused a significant
drop in the number of these cells (to a level observed in healthy
donors) 14 days after the start of the treatment (Fig. 3B). The
presence of these cells remained at the control level on day 21
and started increasing after day 28. A mixed-effects spline
model with two knots at 14 and 21 days demonstrated that
upward trend was not significant (P ¼ 0.175). A similar trend
was continued after the second cycle of treatment; however,
the change was not significant (P ¼ 0.965). Thus, although
populations of PMN-MDSCs showed a trend to increase after
day 28, it was not statistically significant.
DS-8273a did not affect populations of neutrophils and mono-
cytes (Fig. 3C) nor did it have an impact on other myeloid
and lymphoid cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). Treatment with
DS-8273a did not affect the number of MDSCs in patients that
had pretreatment eMDSCs or PMN-MDSCs numbers within the
healthy donor range (Fig. 3D).
We performed a similar analysis with the population of
M-MDSCs. In contrast to PMN-MDSCs, only two patients
had elevated level of these cells (Fig. 3E). In both patients,
DS-8273a dramatically reduced the numbers of M-MDSCs to
the control level and remained low for the duration of the

population of MDSCs without affecting other myeloid cells and
lymphocytes.
Depletion of MDSCs in tumor tissue and association with
clinical outcome
Tumor biopsies were collected in 10 patients enrolled to the
dose expansion cohort. Six of the patients had paired pre- and
posttreatment (day 28) biopsies. We evaluated the populations
of CD163þ macrophages, elastase positive neutrophils, puta-
tive (CD33þS100A9þ) MDSCs (22) as well as Foxp3-positive
regulatory T cells, CD4þ, CD8þ, and CD8þPD1þ T cells by
immunofluorescence staining and IHC (Fig. 4A; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S6). Prior to start of the treatment, no correlations
between the presence of various populations of myeloid cells
and T cells were observed. Three of 6 patients demonstrated a
decrease in intratumoral MDSCs, whereas one patient had
decreased macrophages and neutrophils (Fig. 4B). In those 3
patients who had a decrease in MDSC number within the
tumor, the ratios of CD8þ:MDSC and CD4þ:MDSC, as well
as proportion of PD1þ cells among CD8þ T cells:MDSC were
increased, whereas in patients with unchanged levels of
MDSCs,
the
ratios
were
either
unchanged
or
decreased
(Fig. 4C), indicating that the MDSC decrease was not a reflec-
tion of the overall changes in the immune cell infiltration of the
tumor and was specific for those cells.
Because we have implicated TRAIL-R expression on MDSC as
being associated with their sensitivity to agonist antibody, we
evaluated the expression of three TRAIL-Rs (DR5, DcR1, DcR2) in
PMN-MDSCs during the treatment. No changes were observed
during the treatment in the expression of DR5 and DcR1 (Fig. 4D).
However, expression of DcR2 was significantly lower on day 14
(P ¼ 0.03) with a trend to an increase on days 21 and 28, which
follows the pattern of PMN-MDSC changes. Pretreatment level of
DcR2 as well as other TRAIL-Rs did not correlate with subsequent
changes in PMN-MDSC numbers.

 There were no objective clinical responses (CR and PR) in
DS-8273a-treated patients on this trial. We assessed whether
the changes in PMN-MDSC during the treatment (ratio
between PMN-MDSC numbers during and prior to the
treatment) correlated with the time to progression (TTP) or
duration of progression-free survival (PFS). Both TTP and PFS
were the same in the subjects in whom the MDSCs were
analyzed. Changes in PMN-MDSC on day 14 were not asso-
ciated with PFS. However, on day 21, changes in PMN-MDSC
demonstrated a weak but significant inverse correlation with
the TTP. This correlation became stronger on days 28 and 42
(Table 2). These results indicate that a decrease in MDSCs
during DS-8273a treatment was associated with longer TTP in
these patients. As described above, the populations of PMN-
MDSCs increased in some patients on day 28 of the treatment
so we asked whether those changes were associated with
clinical outcome. We calculated the TTP for patients who
retained control levels of PMN-MDSCs by day 28 as well as
for those who had elevated levels of these cells, and patients
who retained control levels of MDSCs had a significantly
longer TTP than the patients who had elevated levels of
PMN-MDSCs (Fig. 4E).
Discussion
We report here the first successful attempt to selectively elim-
inate MDSCs in cancer patients. This study is based on previous
observations that MDSCs in mice and cancer patients are more
sensitive to TRAIL-R2 agonistic antibody or TRAIL than their
normal counterparts (15). In mice, this effect was mediated by
upregulation of TRAIL-R2, whereas in cancer patients it was
mediated mostly by a decrease in DcR2. Targeting of TRAIL-R in
mice caused depletion of MDSCs and substantially improved the
antitumor effect of a CTLA4-blocking antibody (15). These results
suggested that targeting TRAIL-R2 could be potentially useful in
targeting MDSCs in humans. The use of TRAIL-R2 agonist anti-
bodies in cancer patients has been previously reported and
demonstrated a very good safety profile (23, 24). However, the

 antitumor activity of this antibody as monotherapy was limited
(25). Tigatuzumab in combination with gemcitabine led to eight
partial responses in pancreatic cancer patients (n ¼ 61) and
demonstrated no anticancer activity in lung cancer patients
(n ¼ 91), both being phase II clinical trials (26, 27). Another
TRAIL-R2–targeting antibody, conatumab, was also tested in a
randomized phase II clinical trial in combination with chemo-
therapy and did not demonstrate objective clinical response in
patients with colorectal, pancreatic, soft tissue sarcoma, or lung
cancer (28–31). Heterogeneous expression of the DR5 receptor on
tumor cells, poor penetration of the antibody to solid tumors,
and/or the relatively low affinity of the antibody could explain the
low clinical efficacy of the treatment. We suggested that TRAIL-R2
antibody could have an effect independent of its ability to directly
target solid tumors, by eliminating MDSCs in patients with high
levels of these cells suppressing host antitumor immunity.
We observed increases in PMN-MDSCs and eMDSCs in nine
of 16 patients (56%). This is somewhat lower than we and
others have previously reported (32, 33). Overnight shipment
of samples before analysis could contribute to this phenome-
non. However, we believe that shipment probably played a
relatively minor role due to the fact that control samples were
also stored overnight and that in previous studies shipment of
samples did not have a significant effect on the function of
MDSCs. Other more likely explanation is that the patients in
this trial were heavily pretreated with chemotherapy prior to
enrollment to the study in addition to being heterogeneous in
their tumor types. This may also explain the low number of
CD4þ cells, B cells, and NK cells in these patients. Increase of
M-MDSCs in only two patients was not surprising as M-MDSC
are largely increased in patients with melanoma, multiple
myeloma and to some extent prostate cancer, which were very
poorly represented in this trial.
The main finding of this study is that DS-8273a caused rapid
elimination of MDSCs in patients with elevated levels of these
cells at baseline without affecting any other cell populations. It
also did not affect MDSCs in patients with control levels of the
cells. These results describe the first example of highly selective
elimination of MDSCs in patients. The effect was observed until
the end of the first cycle (day 21) and was associated with a
decrease in DcR2 expression. However, the second cycle of treat-
ment failed to prolong this effect in all patients. A number of
patients had elevated number of PMN-MDSCs by day 28 (day 7 of
cycle 2) and was associated with an increase in DcR2 expression.
Elevated levels of PMN-MDSCs at day 28 were associated with a
shorter time to disease progression. Overall, changes in PMN-
MDSCs and eMDSCs inversely correlated with clinical outcome
supporting the role of these cells in regulation of tumor progres-
sion. No direct conclusions could be drawn from these results
because of heterogeneous patient population and relatively small
number of patients; however, it suggests further that a more
detailed study is warranted.
Why did DS-8273a treatment fail to control MDSC levels
longer? There are two possible explanations of this phenomenon.
Treatment with DS-8273a can cause a compensatory increase in
DcR2 expression which could prevent further action of the anti-
body. However, this explanation is less likely due to the fact that
relative upregulation of DcR2 in MDSCs by day 28 just returned it
to pretreatment level. That level did not prevent effective elimi-
nation of these cells during first cycle of treatment. The most likely
explanation is that in the patients with highly advanced cancer
elimination of MDSCs by itself was not sufficient to control tumor
progression. This phenomenon was previously demonstrated in
numerous studies in mice (5). Rapid tumor progression that was
observed in the patients on this trial might have resulted in
increased production of MDSCs which the antibody was unable
to control. The fact that patients with control levels of MDSCs on
day 28 had significantly longer TTP than patient with elevated
levels of MDSCs support this explanation.
The presented data demonstrate that DS-8273a maintained
selective depletion of MDSC for at least 28 days, which may
provide a sufficient window of therapeutic activity in combi-
nation with immunotherapies using adoptive T cells transfer, or
PD-1 antibody. This data provided the first demonstration of
selective elimination of MDSCs in patients with advanced
cancers that was associated with prolonged TTP. Our observa-
tions open an opportunity for the clinical combination of
TRAIL-R2–targeting antibody with various immunotherapeutic
strategies.
