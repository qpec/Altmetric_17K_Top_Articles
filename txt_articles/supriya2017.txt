Abstract 
Objectives: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with diabetes mellitus and 
cardiovascular diseases. Our previous study indicated that people with MetS showed a 
decrease in waist circumference and a decreasing trend in blood pressure after 1 year of 
yoga. This study investigated the effect of yoga on MetS people with high-normal blood 
pressure by exploring modulations in pro-inflammatory adipokines (leptin, chemerin, 
visfatin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or PAI-1) and an anti-inflammatory 
adipokine (adiponectin).  
Design & Methods: A total of 97 Hong Kong Chinese individuals aged 57.6 ± 9.1 years 
with MetS and high-normal blood pressure were randomly assigned to control (n = 45) 
and yoga groups (n = 52). Participants in the control group were not given any 
intervention but were contacted monthly to monitor their health status. Participants in the 
yoga group underwent a yoga training programme with three 1-hour yoga sessions 
weekly for 1 year. The participants’ sera were harvested and assessed for adipokines. 
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to examine the interaction effect 
between 1 year of time (pre vs. post) and intervention (control vs. yoga).  
Results: GEE analyses revealed significant interaction effects between 1-year of time 
and yoga intervention for the decreases in leptin and chemerin and the increase in 
adiponectin concentration in the sera examined.

Conclusion: These results demonstrated that 1 year of yoga training decreased pro-
inflammatory adipokines and increased anti-inflammatory adipokine in adults with MetS 
and high-normal blood pressure. These findings support the beneficial role of yoga in 
managing MetS by favourably modulating adipokines.

Introduction 
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clinically significant predictor of all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality. MetS represents a cluster of metabolic abnormalities including 
central obesity, high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and 
hyperglycaemia. Central obesity and insulin resistance are considered important 
underlying contributors to MetS 
1. Furthermore, some researchers believe that 
hypertension might be another chief contributor to MetS as hypertension increases the 
risk for obesity and insulin resistance 2,3. Approximately 65-75 % of hypertensive 
individuals are obese, and 50 % of hypertensive individuals are insulin resistant 4. 
Notably, it has been shown that the prevalence of elevated blood pressure or 
hypertension among people with MetS could be as high as 85 % 3. Thus, it has been 
proposed that blood pressure control might be an important strategy in reducing the risk 
of MetS in healthy individuals.  
 
Lifestyle modification has been suggested to be the keystone for successful 
management of MetS 5,6. Yoga is a blend of physical exercise, controlled breathing and 
relaxation practice. Hatha yoga, a commonly practised yoga stream, consists of asana 
(control of postures) and pranayama (manipulation of respiration). Yoga appears to have

an anti-hypertensive effect as well as a positive impact on self-rated quality of life. 
Improvements of MetS risk factors in middle-aged and older adults have been 
demonstrated to be associated with yoga intervention 10. One year of yoga training was 
shown to exert beneficial effect on reducing abdominal obesity and tended to decrease 
blood pressure in MetS people 10. Moreover, a short-term intensive yoga programme (90 
minutes/day for 15 consecutive days) has also been demonstrated to cause favourable 
changes in body mass index, waist and hip circumference, total cholesterol, postural 
stability, and hand grip strength 11. Indeed, yoga exercise has been shown to decrease 
stress, reduce depression and anxiety, and increase perceived self-efficacy in healthy 
individuals. The reduction of stress has been proposed as one of the potential underlying 
mechanisms explaining the benefits of yoga exercise 12. Intriguingly, a cross-sectional 
study comparing the stress hormones between novice and expert yoga practitioners 
demonstrated that leptin was lowered and the ratio of adiponectin-to-leptin was doubled 
in experts when compared to novice yoga practitioners 12. 
 
An epidemiological link between adiposity and hypertension has been illustrated. 
Adipose tissue is a heterogeneous organ comprised of subcutaneous and visceral 
adipose tissue. The incidence of hypertension has been reported to be strongly 
associated with increased visceral adiposity 13. Compared to subcutaneous adipose 
tissue, visceral fat is more sensitive to lipolysis and secretes higher amounts of 
inflammatory cytokines such as PAI-1 14, visfatin 15, and chemerin 16. In addition to 
visceral adipokines, subcutaneous adipokines have been correlated with hypertension. 
Subcutaneous adipose depot secretions of leptin and adiponectin might be useful in the 
prediction of hypertension 17. The progressive interaction between pro-inflammatory and 
anti-inflammatory adipokines is commonly thought to play a significant role in the 
developmental 
process

abnormalities.

understanding of the equilibrium and balance of adipokines (i.e., pro- vs. anti-
inflammatory adipokines) in response to lifestyle components such as physical exercise 
is critically needed for the new development of regimens to combat MetS and other 
metabolic disorders.  
 
Yoga reduces MetS risk factors 7 as well as inflammatory adipokines 8,9. Our previous 
study indicated that participants with MetS showed a significant decrease in waist 
circumference and a decreasing trend in blood pressure (p = 0.067) with moderate effect 
size after 1 year of yoga intervention 10. Therefore, we hypothesized that yoga training 
would induce a favourable modulation of the adipokine profile by reducing the circulatory 
abundance of pro-inflammatory adipokines and increasing anti-inflammatory adipokines 
in adults with MetS and high-normal blood pressure. 
Methods 
Study design and subject recruitment 
This study was a follow-up to our previous randomized controlled trial in which Chinese 
participants aged between 30-80 years who were diagnosed with MetS according to the 
diagnostic guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult 
Treatment Panel (ATP III) criteria underwent a 1-year yoga intervention program in Hong 
Kong. Individuals with MetS were defined as having 3 or more of the following 
characteristics: 1) central obesity (waist circumference ≥ 90 cm for Asian males or ≥ 80 
cm for Asian females); 2) elevated blood glucose (fasting glucose level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L); 3) 
elevated blood pressure (systolic pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic pressure ≥ 85 
mmHg); 4) elevated plasma triglycerides (triglyceride level ≥ 1.7 mmol/L); and 5) a low 
level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C; level ≤ 1.03 mmol/L for males or ≤ 
1.3 mmol/L for females). Participants were randomly allocated into groups using a 
computer program.

In the current study, we specifically selected 97 blood samples of participants (control n 
= 45, yoga n = 52) who had MetS specifically with high-normal blood pressure (systolic 
pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic pressure ≥ 85 mmHg) from the pool of 182 archived 
blood samples from our previous study. The samples from control and yoga intervention 
group were selected from two time points: Pre (baseline measurement at the beginning 
of the study) and Post (the measurement upon accomplishment of the 1 year 
experimental period). Attrition rate in the study was 4.4% as some participants quitted 
the study due to personal reasons and some never showed up after the recruitment. 
 
Yoga intervention 
Participants in the control group were not given any intervention but were contacted 
monthly to monitor their health status. Participants in the yoga group attended 3 yoga 
sessions weekly for 1 year. Each 60-min session consisted of a 10-min warm-up, 40 min 
of hatha yoga practice, and a 10-min cool-down that consisted of a breathing and

relaxation exercise 10. Yoga classes were conducted in a small group (~10 participants) 
by certified yoga instructors. All participants were requested to adhere to their usual daily 
dietary intake and physical activities throughout the one-year experimental period. As an 
incentive, participants were offered a supermarket coupon upon completion of the study. 
Participants in the yoga group who attended less than 70 % of the classes were 
excluded 10. The training protocol of the yoga exercise program is shown in Table 1. 
 
Determination of MetS risk factors 
Participants were assessed by trained research personnel for MetS diagnostic 
parameters including blood pressure, waist circumference, fasting glucose, triglycerides, 
and HDL-C. The blood pressure measurement was performed on the right arm of the 
subject after a 5-min rest in a sitting position. Using an appropriate-sized cuff, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures were measured by an electronic blood pressure monitor 
(Accutorr Plus, Datascope) over the brachial artery region with the arm supported at 
heart level. Waist circumference was measured on the bare skin, midway between the 
lowest rib and the superior border of the iliac crest, using an inelastic measuring tape. 
Venous blood samples were harvested by certified phlebotomists after participants 
fasted overnight. Blood glucose, triglycerides, and HDL-C concentrations were 
measured by an accredited medical laboratory using commercial test kit methods and an 
automatic clinical chemistry analyser (Architect CI8200, Abbott Diagnostics) 10. Systolic 
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, waist circumference, 
HDL-C, and triglycerides were examined at baseline and at the end of the 1-year 
experimental period. Furthermore, the detailed explanations about the methods used for 
the assessment of MetS risk factors are described in our previous publication 10.

Measurement of adipokines 
Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Visfatin from 
BioVision; PAI-1 and chemerin from R&D; leptin and adiponectin from Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) were used to examine the concentrations of adipokines in the serum samples 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The coefficients of variability (CV) for the kit 
assays are as follows: visfatin (intra-assay: 4.4-8 %, inter-assay: 8.2 %), PAI-1 (intra-
assay: 6.8 %, inter-assay: 7 %), chemerin (intra-assay: 3.9 %, inter-assay: 7.3 %), leptin 
(intra-assay: 3.9 %, inter-assay: 5.3 %) and adiponectin (intra-assay: 3.8 %, inter-assay: 
5.5 %). Measurements were performed in duplicates or triplicates by a single observer to 
minimize the observer variation.  
 
Data analyses 
Data are expressed as the means ± standard deviation. The generalized estimating 
equation (GEE) was adopted to examine the interaction effect between 1 year of time 
and the intervention, the main effect of time, and the main effect of intervention on 
adipokines and MetS risk factors. GEE was also used to examine the interaction effect 
between 1 year of time and the yoga intervention on MetS risk factors after adjusting the 
age as a covariate. Normality of the data was verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The 
Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to examine the baseline differences in MetS risk 
factors, age, sex and the changes (post-pre) in the MetS risk factors and adipokines 
between control and yoga groups. The chi-square test was performed to examine the 
baseline differences in the categorical data. All statistical analyses were performed using 
the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 for Windows. 
Statistical significance was indicated by p < 0.05. Our power analyses indicated that the 
statistical power was >80% for most of the outcome measures performed in this study 
including adiponectin, leptin, chemerin, visfatin, diastolic and systolic blood pressure.

Results 
MetS risk factors  
No significant differences were observed in the MetS risk factors, habitual physical 
activity level (as assessed by international physical activity questionnaire or IPAQ) and 
adipokines at the baseline assessment between control and yoga groups (Table 2). Our 
analysis revealed that among all the other MetS risk factors that were measured, the 
mean change (i.e., post-pre) in waist circumference was significantly lower in the yoga 
group compared to the control group (-3.6 vs. -1.4, p = 0.029) (Figure 1). The mean 
waist circumference value was reduced by 4 % in the yoga group and 2 % in control 
group (Figure 2 F). 
 
Further analysis revealed that there was no significant interaction effect between time 
and intervention for diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, high density 
lipoprotein, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and waist circumference in our examined MetS 
participants with high-normal blood pressure (Figure 2). Of note, we also found no 
significant interaction effect between time and intervention on MetS risk factors in MetS 
participants with high-normal blood pressure after adjusting for the age as a covariate. 
The main effect of time was observed for systolic blood pressure (Wald chi square = 
12.4, p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (Wald chi square = 6.3, p = 0.012), and waist 
circumference (Wald chi square = 4.4, p = 0.037) (Figure 2 A, B and F).  
 
Anti- and pro-inflammatory adipokines  
Our results revealed significant differences in the mean value of change (i.e., post-pre) 
in adiponectin (-1.0 vs. 1.3, p < 0.001), PAI-1 (0.9 vs. 0.4, p = 0.03), chemerin (46.3 vs. -
32.8, p < 0.001) and leptin (1.9 vs. -6.7, p < 0.001) in the control vs. yoga groups (Figure 
3 A, B, C and D). The mean value of adiponectin levels in the yoga group was increased

by 20.1 % compared to a decrease of 15.5 % in the control group (Figure 4 A). 
Moreover, the mean values of leptin, PAI-1 and chemerin were significantly decreased 
(26.5 %, 6.5 % and 14.3 %, respectively) in the yoga group compared to increases in 
each variable (9 %, 13.5 % and 21 %, respectively) in the control group (Figure 4 B, C 
and D). 
 
Our further analysis revealed the significant interaction effects between time and 
intervention for adiponectin (Wald chi square = 16.2, p < 0.001), leptin (Wald chi square 
= 9.4, p = 0.002), and chemerin (Wald chi square = 11.6, p = 0.001) (Figure 4 A, B and 
D). The main effect of yoga intervention was found for PAI-1 (Wald chi square = 5.9, p = 
0.015) (Figure 4 C). However, the main effect of time was observed for visfatin (Wald chi 
square = 11.78, p = 0.001) (Figure 4 E).  
 
Discussion 
MetS is a serious public health concern due to its intimate link to the pathogenesis of 
diabetes mellitus, stroke, and cardiovascular diseases. In 2010-2012, the prevalence 
rate of MetS in Hong Kong was ~27 % according to the NCEP ATP III criteria 10. Central 
obesity and insulin resistance have been proposed as the prominent underlying 
contributors to MetS. Remarkably, as high as 85 % of MetS individuals have been 
shown to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension 3. Individuals with both MetS 
and hypertension are indeed considered to be significantly challenged and at risk for 
additional morbidities 18. Adipocytes synthesize and release adipokines such as 
adiponectin, leptin, angiotensin, perivascular relaxation factors, and resistin, which are 
all linked with blood pressure control. As adipokines are considered regulators of MetS, 
the equilibrium and balance of adipokines become an important topic to be explored in 
studies of obesity, hypertension and MetS. Our present findings reveal that 1-year of

yoga training increases a circulatory anti-inflammatory adipokine (adiponectin) and 
decreases pro-inflammatory adipokines (leptin, chemerin, and PAI-1) in MetS 
participants with high-normal blood pressure. These novel results support the beneficial 
complementary role of yoga exercise in the management of MetS by illustrating the 
favourable modulating effects of yoga training on blood adipokines. 
 
Reduction in waist circumference and blood pressure have been shown to be positive 
health consequences of regular yoga training 10,19 . Waist circumference and visceral fat 
were decreased after 16 weeks of yoga training compared to a control group of healthy 
postmenopausal women aged 54.5 ± 2.8 years 19. Overweight/obese women and breast 
cancer survivors have also been shown to reduce waist circumference after receiving 6 
months of yoga training when compared to breast cancer survivors who did not receive 
yoga intervention 20. Another study demonstrated that blood pressure was significantly 
reduced by yoga exercise intervention in patients with mild hypertension 21. Consistently, 
our previous investigation also demonstrated that 1 year of yoga training decreased 
waist circumference and tended to reduce systolic blood pressure in middle-aged and 
older adults with MetS compared to the control group who did not receive yoga 
intervention 10. Our results are in accordance with the previous findings that the average 
waist circumference was significantly decreased; however, both systolic and diastolic 
blood pressures were not decreased in participants with yoga intervention compared to 
the control participants with MetS and high-normal blood pressure. This study further 
explored the effect of yoga on the specific subject group with MetS and high-normal 
blood pressure by investigating the interaction effect between yoga and the 1-year time 
period. Our results indicated that there was no interaction effect between yoga and the 
1-year time period for any of the five risk factors of MetS in our examined participants 
with high-normal blood pressure. In accordance with our previous study assumptions

that the effects of yoga exercise on systolic blood pressure might be dependent on the 
quantity of the intervention and/or subject compliance to the intervention 10, we again 
suggested that extra attention should be given to MetS participants with high-normal 
blood pressure. The controversial results might be explained by the complexities 
involved in defining MetS. An equal number of MetS risk factors might not indicate that 
the participants shared the same characteristics and cardiometabolic risk factor profile. 
Indeed, the specific outcomes/consequences of MetS are difficult to evaluate without a 
solid definition and common criteria for diagnosis. Nonetheless, our results support the 
notion that “MetS in hypertension is an unholy alliance” 18.  
 
Evidence indicates that biomarkers might be valuable in diagnosing and estimating the 
disease risk for a population and managing many pathological states, especially when 
clinical signs or obvious anatomic abnormalities are absent or not evident 22. For 
example, insulin resistance is one of the major risk factors of type 2 diabetes (T2D). 
Markers for indicating insulin resistance might be useful for prevention of cardiovascular 
disease, all-cause mortality, and T2D. Increased concentrations of interleukin-8 (IL-8), 
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and interferon γ-induced protein (IP-10) have 
been associated with the incidence of T2D by hazard ratio risk assessment. One study 
suggested that chemokines including MCP-1, IL-8 and IP-10 were significantly higher in 
participants who developed T2D during a follow-up of 10 years compared with those 
who did not develop T2D 23. An aerobic exercise (225 min/week) intervention conducted 
on postmenopausal inactive women resulted in decreases in insulin resistance markers 
(leptin, adiponectin/leptin ratio, insulin), whereas changes in glucose (one of the risk 
factors for MetS) were not evident 24. Another study by the same group suggested that 
adipokines and systemic inflammation may be associated with the risk of breast cancer 
in postmenopausal women independent of body mass index 25. They concluded that

after performing long-term aerobic exercise, previously inactive postmenopausal women 
showed changes in insulin, leptin, and adiponectin/leptin, which might reduce the risk for 
postmenopausal breast cancer 24. Numerous studies support the idea that hypertensive 
patients with MetS will show early signs of end-organ damage, which are recognized as 
significant independent predictors of adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared to 
those without MetS 26. Therefore, individuals with high-normal blood pressure and MetS 
should receive special attention. 
 
Researchers suggested that MetS identification should be emphasized when treating 
patients with hypertension 27,28. In this study, adipokines were observed to be favourably 
regulated after yoga intervention in MetS subjects with high-normal blood pressure. 
These results proposed that an adipokine panel as a circulatory biomarker might be 
useful for identifying the protective outcomes of interventions, especially in worsening 
metabolic conditions in which changes in clinical outcomes are not obvious. Biomarkers 
aid in the diagnosis and management of many pathological states when there are no 
obvious clinical signs or anatomic abnormalities 16. Nonetheless, each adipokine has a 
particular role in maintaining the delicate equilibrium between the pathophysiological 
effect and protective impact. Although numerous effects of adipocytokines have been 
reported in recent studies, further investigation of their signalling pathways is still needed 
to understand how they are eventually integrated. 
 
The regular practice of yoga exercise has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing 
stress and improving physical and psychological health. Yoga exercise has also been 
proposed to reduce oxidative stress by at least two mechanisms 29,30. The first 
mechanism is via the suppression of the over-activated sympathoadrenal system and 
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 29,30, which reduces the pro-inflammatory

responses by decreasing the levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and epinephrine 
29,30. Yoga exercise has been shown to alleviate inflammatory signalling by 
downregulating 
the 
regulatory 
molecule 
that 
favours 
the 
pro-inflammatory 
microenvironment 31, namely, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated 
B cells (NF-κB) 32. Consistent with the role of NF-κB, the downregulation of the 
regulatory molecules for the pro-inflammatory microenvironment reasonably explains the 
principal behind the first mechanism. The second mechanism is attributed to the 
reactivation of the parasympathetic nervous system by consciously manipulating the 
breath rhythm (i.e., slow breathing and a long exhalation) during yoga practice 33. The 
activities of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in peripheral 
tissues and organs are known to be facilitated by the specific regulation of the 
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems 34. Intriguingly, AMPK is a regulatory 
molecule that favours the anti-inflammatory microenvironment. AMPK functions to 
mediate fat oxidation, reduce circulating fatty acids and triacylglycerol, and increase 
glucose transport in muscle. In mammals, AMPK has been demonstrated to contribute to 
glucose homeostasis, appetite regulation, and exercise adaptation 35. Thus, the 
upregulation of anti-inflammatory responses by increasing fat oxidation, reducing 
circulatory fatty acids and promoting insulin sensitivity through the AMPK pathway 
sensibly contributes to the principal behind the second mechanism. Nevertheless, the 
precise underlying mechanisms that explain how yoga practice causes the observed 
alterations of circulatory adipokines are unclear, and this topic warrants additional 
research to fully understand the relationship between yoga exercise training and the 
adipokine profile. Provided that MetS is a condition that is characterized by chronic low-
grade inflammation, it is rational that an equilibrium between the anti-inflammatory and 
pro-inflammatory microenvironments plays a critical role in preventing the development 
of MetS.

We aimed to provide an estimate of the true efficacy of the intervention, i.e., among 
those who completed the treatment as planned (per protocol analysis). Nonetheless, the 
convenience sampling with restricted inclusion criteria and the use of per protocol 
analysis in our study design might have limited the study generalizability and 
exaggerated the treatment effect. Future research with the inclusion of both intention to 
treat analysis and per protocol analysis in the study design might be able to strengthen 
the present findings. Furthermore, the inclusion of active control group might further 
enhance the significance of the findings. It remains to be elucidated whether the 
establishment of a regular gathering group and regular exercise habit might contribute to 
the beneficial effects of our observed outcome measures other than the yoga 
intervention.  
 
Perspective 
The present study demonstrates that 1 year of yoga training induces a favourable 
modulation of circulatory adipokines. These findings support the notion that yoga 
exercise might serve as an effective lifestyle intervention to reduce chronic inflammation 
by downregulating the pro-inflammatory adipokines and upregulating the anti-
inflammatory adipokines in individuals with high-normal blood pressure and MetS. A 
panel of adipokines as circulatory biomarkers might be useful for monitoring the 
beneficial outcomes of prolonged yoga exercise interventions.

Figure 1. The box plot represents the change (i.e., post-pre) in waist circumference after 
yoga training in subjects with MetS and high-normal blood pressure. Statistical 
significance was set at p < 0.05.  
 
Figure 2. Line graphs represent the changes in systolic blood pressure (A), diastolic 
blood pressure (B), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (C), triglycerides (D), fasting 
glucose (E), and waist circumference (F) before (Pre) and after (Post) the 1-year 
experimental period in MetS subjects with high-normal blood pressure in control (n = 45) 
and yoga groups (n = 52). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Data are 
expressed as the means ± standard deviation. 
 
Figure 3. Box plots represent the changes (i.e., post-pre) in adipokines including 
adiponectin (A), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (B), chemerin (C), and leptin (D) after 
yoga training in subjects with MetS and high-normal blood pressure. Statistical 
significance was set at p < 0.05.  
 
Figure 4. Line graphs represent the concentrations of leptin (A), plasminogen activator 
inhibitor-1 (B), chemerin (C), visfatin (D), and adiponectin (E) before (Pre) and after 
(Post) the 1-year experimental period in MetS subjects with high-normal blood pressure 
in control (n = 45) and yoga groups (n = 52). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
