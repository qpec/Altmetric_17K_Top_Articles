Objective: Weight stigma is a chronic stressor that may increase cardiometabolic risk. Some individuals
with obesity self-stigmatize (i.e., weight bias internalization, WBI). No study to date has examined
whether WBI is associated with metabolic syndrome.
Methods: Blood pressure, waist circumference, and fasting glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol were measured at baseline in 178 adults with obesity enrolled in a weight-loss trial. Medica-
tion use for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and prediabetes was included in criteria for metabolic syndrome. One
hundred fifty-nine participants (88.1% female, 67.3% black, mean BMI 5 41.1 kg/m2) completed the Weight
Bias Internalization Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, to assess depressive symptoms). Odds
ratios and partial correlations were calculated adjusting for demographics, BMI, and PHQ-9 scores.
Results: Fifty-one participants (32.1%) met criteria for metabolic syndrome. Odds of meeting criteria for
metabolic syndrome were greater among participants with higher WBI, but not when controlling for all
covariates (OR 5 1.46, 95% CI 5 1.00–2.13, P 5 0.052). Higher WBI predicted greater odds of having high
triglycerides (OR 5 1.88, 95% CI 5 1.14–3.09, P 5 0.043). Analyzed categorically, high (vs. low) WBI pre-
dicted greater odds of metabolic syndrome and high triglycerides (Ps < 0.05).
Conclusions: Individuals with obesity who self-stigmatize may have heightened cardiometabolic risk.
Biological and behavioral pathways linking WBI and metabolic syndrome require further exploration.

Introduction
Across the world, individuals with obesity are viewed as stereotypi-
cally lazy, lacking willpower, incompetent, unattractive, and to
blame for their excess weight (1). Due to these negative, prejudicial
beliefs (known as weight bias), individuals with obesity face public
derogation,
devaluation,
and
discrimination
(known
as
weight
stigma) (2). Weight stigma is a prominent psychosocial consequence
of obesity that is associated with increased risk for depression,
anxiety, body dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem (3). In addition to
experiencing weight stigma perpetrated by others, some individuals
with obesity may internalize weight-biased attitudes by applying
negative stereotypes to themselves and devaluing themselves due to
their weight (4). This self-directed stigma, also known as weight
bias internalization (WBI), is associated with similar psychological
outcomes as experiences of weight-based stigmatization enacted by
others (3). WBI is higher among individuals with more frequent

CLINICAL TRIALS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Obesity
 experiences of weight stigma (5,6), although experiencing and inter-
nalizing stigma are considered related yet independent constructs
(6,7). Consistent with research that cognitive appraisal of a stressful
life event is more predictive of negative psychological outcomes
than the event itself (8), recent findings suggest that WBI (a cogni-
tive process) may be a more robust predictor of psychological dis-
tress than the experience of weight stigma alone (9).
Additional research has begun to establish that experiencing (or per-
ceiving) weight stigma, principally weight discrimination, is associ-
ated with physical health consequences. In a study of two large, repre-
sentative samples that followed participants in the U.S. longitudinally
for 4 to 10 years, Sutin et al. (10) reported that perceiving weight dis-
crimination increased risk of mortality by 57% over and above the
effects of mental and physical health risk factors. Other studies have
also demonstrated that perceived weight discrimination is associated
with increases in weight, waist circumference, and, for those in the
overweight range, the development of obesity over time (11,12).
Among individuals with and without type 2 diabetes, weight-based
discrimination is also associated with poorer glycemic control, even
when controlling for body mass index (BMI), depressive symptoms,
and other relevant health variables (13,14).
A combination of biological and behavioral pathways may explain the
associations between weight stigma and poor physical health (15).
Stigma broadly is considered a chronic stressor (16), which can elicit
a biochemical stress response marked by changes in autonomic
response, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocoritcal axis activation, oxi-
dative stress, and inflammation (15). For example, experimental stud-
ies that exposed participants (predominantly white women) to weight
stigma have demonstrated heightened blood pressure and increased
cortisol reactivity (17,18). Increased appetite and/or physiological
arousal resulting from these biochemical changes, combined with
emotional responses, may contribute to observed increases in calorie
consumption and binge eating in individuals who have been directly
exposed to or experienced weight stigma (19,20). Individuals who
report weight-stigmatizing experiences also tend to avoid physical
activity (21). In addition, individuals who perceive or experience
weight stigma in health care settings are more likely to avoid or delay
preventive care, thus increasing risk for disease progression (22).
These studies examining the relationship between weight stigma and
physical health have not included assessments of WBI, and gener-
ally less is known about the relationship between WBI and cardio-
metabolic markers of health. In several studies, correlations have
been found between WBI and poorer self-reported health, increased
binge eating, and reduced physical activity (6,20,23-27), suggesting
that similar pathways to poor health may exist for WBI as with
weight stigma perpetrated by others. Several studies have demon-
strated that WBI is a partial mediator between experiences of weight
stigma and poor health behaviors (such as uncontrolled eating and
reduced exercise) (5,6). Additionally, one study found that BMI was
only associated with poor health-related quality of life among indi-
viduals with high versus low WBI (28). Thus, it is possible that acti-
vation of internalized, negative beliefs following or independent of
stigmatizing experiences may lead to heightened stress and subse-
quent maladaptive coping behaviors (e.g., binge eating).
Although limited research has investigated cardiometabolic risk associ-
ated with other forms of internalized stigma (e.g., racism) (29), some
studies have reported associations between internalized racism and
greater risk of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and other indices
of obesity-related health (30). However, no study to date has investi-
gated the relationship between WBI and cardiometabolic risk factors
commonly associated with obesity. Metabolic syndrome, which refers
to a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes
(31), is particularly relevant to investigate. Approximately 35% to 40%
of adults in the U.S. have metabolic syndrome, and 60% of adults with
obesity meet criteria for this diagnosis (32). Individuals with metabolic
syndrome have a twofold increased risk for cardiovascular disease and a
fivefold risk for type 2 diabetes (31,33).
This study examined the relationship between WBI and metabolic
syndrome. We hypothesized that in persons with obesity, higher lev-
els of WBI would be associated with increased odds of having meta-
bolic syndrome. We also explored the relationships between WBI
and the individual cardiometabolic risk factors that constitute meta-
bolic syndrome, in order to determine which risk factors may be
more strongly linked to WBI.
Methods
Participants
Participants were 178 adults with obesity recruited from the commu-
nity to participate in a weight-loss trial. The primary purpose of the
study was to test the effects of a 1-year weight-loss maintenance pro-
gram, to which participants were randomly assigned if they lost �5%
of initial weight during a 14-week diet run-in period. Eligible partici-
pants had a BMI �33 kg/m2 (or �30 kg/m2 with comorbidities) and
�55 kg/m2 and were: age 21 to 65 years; weight stable with no history
of bariatric surgery; not on medications that would affect weight or on
medications contraindicated with the weight-loss medication used in
the 1-year maintenance study; and under the care of a primary care
physician. They also were free of: current, severe depressive episodes;
suicidal ideation; type 1 or type 2 diabetes; uncontrolled hypertension;
cardiovascular, valvular heart, hepatic, renal, or uncontrolled thyroid
disease; or other medical conditions that could compromise the partic-
ipant’s ability to complete the weight-loss program. Only baseline
data were analyzed in the current study. The study was approved by
the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.
Procedures
Participants were recruited from the community through print, radio,
and Web advertisements and screened over the phone for eligibility.
Following the initial phone screen, interested participants were eval-
uated in person by trained clinicians for eligibility and appropriate-
ness. All participants underwent a medical exam with a physician or
nurse practitioner before enrollment, which included assessment of
current medications. At this initial screening visit, blood pressure
and waist circumference were measured, and blood draws completed
to obtain measures of fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Height and weight also were
measured at this screening visit, and weight was measured again
during the first week of the study (prior to any weight-loss interven-
tion). Questionnaires were administered online (via REDcap) or in
hard copy form via mail up to 2 weeks prior to the start of the pro-
gram. Data for the present study are based on these screening meas-
ures, obtained before the 14-week run-in diet.

 Measures
Anthropometric measures.
Weight was measured (with partici-
pants dressed in light clothing and without shoes) on a digital scale
(Detecto, model 6800A). Height was measured using a wall-
mounted stadiometer (Veeder-Root, Elizabethtown, NC).
Cardiometabolic risk factors.
Blood samples were collected
following an 8-hour fast and analyzed by Quest Diagnostics (Hor-
sham, PA) for levels of triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and glucose
(and other tests to assess patient safety). Blood pressure and pulse
were measured in duplicate, at 1-minute intervals (after a 5-minute
seated rest), using an automated monitor (Dinamap, model 9300,
Johnson & Johnson), following methods described previously (34).
Waist
circumference
was
measured
with
a
flexible
tension-
controlled measuring tape midway between the iliac crest and lowest
rib to the nearest 0.1 cm (34). Metabolic syndrome was defined by
the presence of three or more of the following five risk factors:
central or abdominal obesity (i.e., waist circumference �35 inches
for women, �40 inches for men); elevated triglycerides (i.e.,
�150 mg/dL) and/or use of medication for dyslipidemia (i.e.,
statins);
low
HDL
cholesterol
(i.e.,
�50
mg/dL
for
women,
�40 mg/dL for men); elevated blood pressure (i.e., �130/85 mm
Hg) and/or antihypertensive medication; and elevated fasting blood
glucose (i.e., �100 mg/dL) and/or medication to treat prediabetic
levels of blood glucose (31).
Weight Bias Internalization (WBI) Scale.
The 11-item WBIS
(4) is a widely used, validated measure of WBI (i.e., self-directed
weight stigma), including in treatment-seeking samples (23-25). The
scale assesses the extent to which people apply weight-based stereo-
types to themselves (e.g., “Because of my weight, I don’t understand
how anyone attractive would want to date me.”) and evaluate them-
selves negatively due to weight (e.g., “I hate myself for being over-
weight.”). Responses are rated on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to
7 (strongly agree), with higher scores signifying greater WBI. The
scale demonstrated good internal validity in the current sample
(a 5 0.84).
Depression.
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (35) is a
nine-item, self-report measure of depression. Items assess the fre-
quency of symptoms of depression (e.g., “little interest or pleasure
in doing things”) over the past 2 weeks, and responses range from 0
(not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Scores are summed, with higher
scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms. The
PHQ-9 is currently recommended by the American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation as the optimal depression severity measure for DSM-5 (36).
The
PHQ-9
had
good
internal
validity
in
the
current
study
(a 5 0.85).
Statistical analyses
Natural log transformations were performed to adjust for skewed
values of triglycerides, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, and
PHQ-9 scores. All tests were two-tailed and used a P < 0.05 level of
significance. Analyses of variance and correlations were tested to
determine associations between WBI and participant characteristics,
BMI, and depressive symptoms.
We constructed a binary logistic regression model to test our pri-
mary hypothesis that participants with higher WBI would exhibit
increased odds of having metabolic syndrome. To receive this diag-
nosis, participants had to meet criteria for three of the five cardio-
metabolic risk factors described above. We controlled for age, sex,
race, ethnicity, and BMI in all analyses. Given some findings show-
ing a relationship between metabolic syndrome and depression (37),
we also controlled for PHQ-9 scores in all analyses. Thus, we tested
the relationship between WBI and metabolic syndrome above and
beyond the effects of demographics, BMI, and depression.
Following the primary analysis, separate logistic regression models
were constructed for each risk factor (defined categorically, as
described previously) to test their associations with WBI. We also

 calculated partial correlations (controlling for demographics, BMI,
and PHQ-9 scores) between WBIS scores and continuous variables
of each cardiometabolic risk factor. Additionally, we included sup-
plementary analyses in which we constructed the same six logistic
regression models, but with WBI defined categorically as “high”
versus “low” based on tertiles. This dichotomization of WBI is con-
sistent with prior research (28,30).
Missing data.
At baseline, eight participants were missing waist
circumference measurements. These participants were excluded from
analyses that included waist circumference or metabolic syndrome
diagnosis as outcome variables.
Results
Participant characteristics
Completed study questionnaires were obtained from 159 partici-
pants, whose characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The major-
ity of participants were women and black. Table 1 also presents a
summary of the number of participants meeting criteria for meta-
bolic syndrome, as well as participants’ mean weight, height, BMI,
and scores on the WBIS and PHQ-9.
Race/ethnicity was coded into three categories of non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and all other racial/ethnic groups. Analy-
sis of variance revealed significant differences in WBIS scores by
race (P < 0.001). Post hoc paired t-tests revealed that black partici-
pants scored significantly lower on the WBIS than white partici-
pants: mean (6SD) scores for black participants 5 3.36 6 1.08, and
for white participants 5 4.22 6 1.15 (P < 0.001). WBIS scores corre-
lated significantly with depressive symptoms (r 5 0.38, P < 0.001).
Age, sex, and BMI were not significantly associated with WBIS
scores.
Primary analysis: Metabolic syndrome
Table 2 presents the results from the logistic regression analysis that
examined the association between WBI and metabolic syndrome,
controlling for demographics, BMI, and depressive symptoms. When
controlling for BMI and depressive symptoms, participants with
higher WBIS scores had greater odds of meeting criteria for meta-
bolic syndrome (OR 5 1.41, P 5 0.042). However, when demo-
graphics were included in the model, this relationship was no longer
statistically significant (OR 5 1.46, P 5 0.052). Participant age was
the only covariate associated with metabolic syndrome in the model
(OR 5 1.05, P 5 0.004).
Secondary analyses: Cardiometabolic risk factors
To explore the factors responsible for heightened odds of meta-
bolic syndrome, we examined the associations between WBI and
each component of the condition via five separate logistic regres-
sion models (all controlling for demographics, BMI, and PHQ-9
scores) and partial correlations (controlling also for respective
medication use). Of the logistic regression models, only the model
that tested the relationship between WBI and high triglycerides
was significant (see Table 2). Participants with higher WBIS
scores had greater odds of having high triglycerides and/or taking
medication for dyslipidemia, even when controlling for all covari-
ates (OR 5 1.88, P 5 0.013). Only one participant did not meet the
waist circumference criterion, and no associations between this
risk factor and WBIS scores emerged. Associations were not sig-
nificant between WBIS scores and blood pressure or glucose.
Only eight participants met the glucose/medication criterion (due
to the participant exclusion criterion of type 2 diabetes). WBIS
scores correlated positively with triglycerides (P 5 0.021) and neg-
atively with HDL cholesterol (P 5 0.009). However, these correla-
tions were not statistically significant when controlling for all
covariates (see Table 3).

 Supplementary analyses
Consistent with prior research in which internalized stigma was
dichotomized to determine effects of “high” versus “low” values
(28,30), we examined the relationship between WBI, metabolic syn-
drome, and the individual risk factors in six additional logistic
regression models (controlling for all aforementioned covariates), in
which WBI was categorized as high versus low based on tertiles.
Cutoff scores of 4.18 (n 5 57) and 3.09 (n 5 52) were used to define
high and low scores, respectively. Logistic regression analyses con-
trolling for all covariates demonstrated that participants high in WBI
had three times greater odds of meeting criteria for metabolic syn-
drome (OR 5 3.19, P 5 0.039), and six times greater odds of having
high triglycerides and/or taking medication (OR 5 6.13, P 5 0.018)
than participants low in WBI (see Table 4).
Discussion
This study of treatment-seeking individuals with obesity found
mixed results concerning the relationship between metabolic syn-
drome and WBI. This relationship was not significant when all
covariates were included in a regression model in which WBI was
represented continuously. However, the odds of having metabolic
syndrome were significantly heightened among participants catego-
rized as having high (versus low) levels of WBI. WBI has been
shown previously to be associated with binge eating (20), reduced
physical activity motivation and engagement (6,23), and poorer self-
reported physical health (24,25). However, this is the first report of
which we are aware to demonstrate a possible association between
WBI and metabolic syndrome.
The only individual component of metabolic syndrome that was sig-
nificantly associated with WBI was high triglycerides/use of medica-
tion for dyslipidemia. Internalized weight bias could elicit a chronic
stress response similar to that observed in reaction to experiences of
weight stigma, such as heightened levels of oxidative stress and cor-
tisol secretion (15). The act of self-stigmatizing may lead to a state
of physiological arousal that itself increases risk for metabolic
abnormalities through biological pathways (e.g., cortisol secretion).
This state of physiological and affective stress may also lead indi-
viduals to cope by eating unhealthy food or binge eating (38). Addi-
tionally, individuals with high WBI exhibit diminished self-efficacy
to exercise due to endorsing negative stereotypes, such as laziness
(6,23), and thus are more likely to avoid physical activity (21). Fur-
ther research is needed to determine the specific biological and/or
behavioral pathways that could account for unfavorable lipid levels.
For example, advanced lipoprotein testing could help to determine
whether the observed effects are diet-induced versus metabolically
endogenous. In-depth dietary analysis could also examine whether
individuals with high WBI consume more high-fat foods, which
could
potentially
account
for
the
elevated
triglyceride
levels
observed in this study. The correlation between WBI and triglycer-
ides was not significant when controlling for covariates, and waist
circumference and blood glucose control were largely homogeneous
in this sample. Thus, replication is required, and further research
with a more heterogeneous representation of these risk factors (e.g.,
including individuals with type 2 diabetes) is needed.
This study was cross-sectional in design, precluding conclusions
about causality. Thus, a converse relationship could be present, in
which poorer physical health (e.g., metabolic syndrome) may lead
individuals with obesity to be more prone to internalizing weight
bias. Individuals with obesity frequently experience weight stigma
in health care settings (22); increased need for health care services
due to poor health may consequently increase exposure to stigma
and heighten vulnerability to internalizing it. Heightened disease
burden may also increase susceptibility to self-blame due to the per-
ceived controllability of weight (2). A longitudinal study of individ-
uals with varying levels of WBI at baseline, but without obesity-
related comorbidities, could help to clarify the temporal relationship
between WBI and risk of metabolic syndrome.
This sample was unique in its predominant composition of black
women, which allowed us to examine WBI among a group of indi-
viduals with obesity that is often not well represented in research
addressing this topic. Black participants had lower levels of WBI on
average, which may reflect reduced vulnerability to body dissatisfac-
tion among black women (39). Black children and adults also gener-
ally have lower triglyceride levels and are thus less likely to be
diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (40). Given these racial differ-
ences, it is possible that the relationship between WBI, triglycerides,
and metabolic syndrome may differ by race as well. We may have
been underpowered in our analyses to detect significant racial differ-
ences in the regression models, as well as sex differences due to the
relatively small number of men in the present sample. Prior studies
examining the relationship between weight discrimination and physi-
cal health outcomes have used large, nationally representative data-
sets (10-12), in which small effects may be better detected. We rec-
ommend
that
future
large-scale
investigations
of
obesity
and
health—particularly
cardiovascular
disease
risk—incorporate
the
WBIS into assessment batteries in order to accumulate more data
and test for potential moderators such as sex and race.
Our findings pertain only to individuals with obesity seeking treat-
ment for weight loss and may not generalize to the broader popula-
tion of individuals with obesity. Prior evidence suggests that
treatment-seeking individuals with obesity exhibit heightened rates
of psychopathology (including depression) in comparison with non-
treatment seeking individuals (41). However, given this study’s
exclusion criteria of severe depression or use of antidepressant medi-
cation, our clinical sample had relatively low levels of depressive
symptoms. The mean WBIS score in this sample was lower than in
other recent studies of treatment-seeking samples (42), which may
reflect the relatively good mental and physical health of this sample.

 Research assessing associations between WBI and health among
individuals with higher levels of WBI, and potentially depressive
symptoms to test for mediation, would be informative to more fully
understand the extent to which self-stigma may affect cardiometa-
bolic risk.
Conclusion
The present findings contribute to the growing body of literature
demonstrating the relationship between weight stigma and adverse
physical health outcomes, once again contradicting a persistent argu-
ment that stigma motivates behavior change and improves health.
Replication is required to determine the relationship between WBI
and metabolic syndrome above and beyond relevant demographics
and health-related covariates. Nevertheless, these findings highlight
the importance of informing the public that weight stigma—includ-
ing self-directed stigma—is stressful and may contribute to poor
health. Further research is needed to develop and test the effects of
interventions that aim to reduce WBI among individuals with obe-
sity. To inform these interventions, future research efforts should
focus on identifying specific biological and behavioral pathways—
such as lipoprotein profiles, dietary intake, and engagement in physi-
cal activity—between WBI and cardiometabolic risk.O
