Optogenetically enhanced pituitary corticotroph
cell activity post-stress onset causes rapid
organizing effects on behaviour
Rodrigo J. De Marco1, Theresa Thiemann1, Antonia H. Groneberg1,w, Ulrich Herget1,w & Soojin Ryu1,2
The anterior pituitary is the major link between nervous and hormonal systems, which allow
the brain to generate adequate and flexible behaviour. Here, we address its role in mediating
behavioural adjustments that aid in coping with acutely threatening environments. For this we
combine optogenetic manipulation of pituitary corticotroph cells in larval zebrafish with newly
developed assays for measuring goal-directed actions in very short timescales. Our results
reveal modulatory actions of corticotroph cell activity on locomotion, avoidance behaviours
and stimulus responsiveness directly after the onset of stress. Altogether, the findings
uncover the significance of endocrine pituitary cells for rapidly optimizing behaviour in local
antagonistic environments.

eversible phenotypic adaptations enable animals to adjust
to local environmental changes, and usually consist of rapid
physiological or sensory changes exerting meaningful
influences on behaviour. Hormones govern these changes, just
as the environment influences humoural responses. Antagonistic
environments stimulate a range of tightly regulated processes
jointly referred to as the stress response1. They serve adaptation
and survival, and involve changes in physiology and behaviour
on multiple timescales. The response relies heavily on the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
(HPA)
axis,
responsible
for
rapid and long-term processes counteracting adversity2. The
pituitary gland is thus the bridge between nervous and hormonal
control systems, and regulates vital functions under hypothalamic
control both normally and in response to stress3.
The onset of stress elicits a modulation of anterior pituitary
hormone-secreting
cells
through
hypophysiotropic
neuro-
hormonal actions, which eventually leads to the expression and
release of pituitary hormones into the circulation4. Stressors for
instance prompt neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of
the rostral hypothalamus to release neurotransmitters like
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), the primary stimulator
of the HPA axis5. CRH binds to the CRH receptor (CRHR)
type 1 in pituitary corticotrophs6 and stimulates cAMP and
Ca2 þ increase preceding hormone secretion7. Corticotrophs
comprise a fraction of the anterior pituitary and express
proopiomelanocortin
(POMC),
the
precursor
of
adreno-
corticotropic hormone (ACTH). CRH is thus the most potent
ACTH secretagogue, and stimulates corticotrophs to release
ACTH which in turn induces the adrenal cortex to produce and
release cortisol5. Stress can be defined empirically as any
condition eliciting the rapid release of ACTH followed by that
of cortisol. Because cortisol release is consistently anchored to
ACTH release, pituitary corticotrophs govern the activity of the
pituitary–adrenal unit, and consequently, the long-term fate of
the stress response. Immediately after the onset of stress, however,
their role in regulating reversible phenotypic adaptations is far
less understood.
For the stress response to be effective as an adaptive response
to the environment, actions of hypothalamic and anterior
pituitary
neuropeptides
must
be
temporally
and
spatially
coordinated. How these modulators interact with each other to
regulate processes within particular time windows is unclear8.
Furthermore, the contribution of distinct modulators to coping
behaviour has been difficult to dissect because the onset of
stress affects several neurotransmitters and hormonal systems
simultaneously. For instance, in addition to its endocrine
functions,
CRH
may
act
as
a
neuromodulator
in
extrahypothalamic circuits, producing a range of autonomic,
electrophysiological and behavioural effects in response to stress,
including increased stimulus responsiveness9,10. ACTH and
glucocorticoids like cortisol have central and peripheral targets,
and can exert rapid actions as well. Fast glucocorticoid effects on
neural activity in mammals have been documented in multiple
brain areas11–13, including the hippocampus14,15, basolateral
amygdala16 and the hypothalamus17–19. Similarly, behavioural
correlates of ACTH and glucocorticoid injections occurring
within minutes to tens of minutes post injection have been
reported20–24.
Despite
these
advances,
the
notion
that
pituitary corticotrophs may contribute to reversible phenotypic
adaptations has so far been based on hormone injections and
varying, usually delayed, measures of dissimilar end points. Due
to the limited accessibility of the hypothalamus and pituitary and
the coupled release of hypothalamic and pituitary neuropeptides,
it has been difficult to selectively modify endogenous activity
levels in pituitary corticotroph cells so as to identify their rapid
modulatory actions on behaviour.
We address this question in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)
using optogenetics and find that optogenetic enhancement of
corticotroph cell activity, immediately after the onset of stress,
is sufficient to induce reversible phenotypic adaptations in very
short timescales. Zebrafish larvae are chosen because their
hypothalamic–pituitary–interrenal (HPI) axis is homologous to
the HPA axis25, their genetic amenability and transparent body
make them ideal for non-invasive optogenetics, and their small
size allows for the continuous measurement of behaviour with full
control of the environment, including the onset of acutely
threatening stimuli. The activity of pituitary corticotrophs can be
modified
by
expressing
Beggiatoa
photo-activated
adenylyl
cyclase (bPAC)26,27 specifically in these cells28. Using light of
different wavelengths as both a potent stressor and a means for
wavelength-dependent
optogenetic
control
of
selective
cell
activity, cAMP-mediated Ca2 þ levels in pituitary corticotroph
cells can be amplified, preceding a higher hormone release and
eventually resulting in over-elevated whole-body cortisol. A set of
novel assays furthermore allows the specification of the ensuing
modulatory actions on locomotion, stressor avoidance and
stimulus responsiveness. Altogether, our findings provide direct
evidence that pituitary corticotroph cells can rapidly modulate
avoidance behaviours on the onset of stress.
Results
Optogenetic manipulation of pituitary corticotroph cells.
Larval zebrafish are highly sensitive to light and react to a
sudden dark-to-light transition with a brief period of increased
locomotion immediately after the light onset, followed by reduced
locomotion during the light period and recovery of baseline
locomotion after the light offset28. These locomotor reactions
closely mimic those of a pH drop, a known potent stressor in fish
(Supplementary Fig. 1a). In briefly dark-adapted larvae, a squared
pulse of either blue or yellow light not only elicits locomotor
reactions, but also increases whole-body cortisol in a graded
manner, depending on light power (per unit of area) and
exposure time (Supplementary Fig. 1b, see also ref. 28). As a
result, the overall locomotion reduction occurring during the light
period correlates well with light power and the ensuing cortisol
level (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Considering the rapidly increased
levels of cortisol as the end point of the HPI axis activation, these
observations indicated that a sudden dark-to-light transition can
act as a threatening stimulus that is sufficient to activate all
elements
of
the
stress
response
(see
also
Supplementary
Discussion and Supplementary Movie 1). To identify rapid
correlates of enhanced endocrine pituitary cell activity on stress
onset, we targeted the expression of bPAC to corticotroph
cells using a fragment of the POMC promoter29 (Fig. 1a,
Supplementary Movie 2).
The activation of bPAC is blue-light-specific due to the
protein’s
BLUF
(blue-light
receptor
using
flavine
adenine
dinucleotide)-type
light
sensor
domain26,27.
Previous
work
showed that the injection of bPAC mRNA into one-cell stage
embryos causes a blue-light-dependent elevation of whole-body
cAMP at 1 day post fertilization (d.p.f.)28. bPAC in corticotroph
cells is thus expected to prompt an increased cAMP production
specifically in response to blue light. In pituitary corticotrophs,
cAMP increase leads to enhanced intracellular Ca2 þ regulating
hormone
secretion30(see
also
Supplementary
Discussion).
We therefore monitored corticotroph cell activity in larvae
expressing bPAC in pituitary corticotrophs (Tg(Pomc:bPAC-2A-
tdTomato)hd10 larvae28, from now on bPAC þ
larvae) by
targeting the Ca2 þ-sensitive photoprotein GFP-Aequorin31 to
the

cells,

larvae on average showed a twofold increase
in photo-emission as compared with their negative siblings

GFP-Aequorin þ larvae). This was not the case with an exposure
to yellow light, further highlighting the over-elevated Ca2 þ level
increase as a blue-light-specific phenomenon (Fig. 1b, bottom;

In pituitary corticotrophs, the cAMP increase downstream
of CRHR activation precedes the release of ACTH30. The
stimulation of bPAC by blue light, responsible for the enhanced
levels of Ca2 þ, is thus expected to amplify the level of circulating
ACTH and, as a consequence, that of whole-body cortisol
(Fig. 1a) since the ACTH receptor (melanocortin receptor type 2
(MC2R)) is expressed in the interrenal gland (Supplementary
Fig. 2, see also ref. 32). As expected, blue light rapidly led to a
transient, wavelength-specific, light power-dependent state of
over-elevated cortisol in bPAC þ larvae28 (see also Fig. 1d).
Altogether, these results indicated that, for bPAC þ larvae, light
can be used as a highly controllable stressor as well as a means to
enhance
the
level
of
pituitary
corticotroph
cell
output
immediately after the onset of stressor exposure.

 cortisol before the light pulse (Supplementary Fig. 3, see also
ref. 28). Both groups showed a light-mediated locomotion
reduction,
but
the
reduction
was
significantly
greater
in
bPAC þ larvae (Fig. 1c). Similarly, in response to light of
low power, both groups showed a brief period of increased
locomotion immediately after the light onset, and again a slight
increase before the light offset. The magnitude of these locomotor
reactions was also greater in bPAC þ larvae (Fig. 1c, left). To
compare light-mediated changes in locomotion between bPAC þ
and bPAC � larvae, we calculated ‘motion change’ as the ratio
between motion during and before the light pulse for each larva,
with motion being measured as the integral of distance swum
every 10 ms for equal time periods during and before the light
pulse. Motion change values across groups confirmed that
the higher the light power, the higher the magnitude of the
light-mediated locomotion reduction, and that bPAC þ larvae
displayed greater reductions than bPAC � larvae (Fig. 1d, top,

analysis

F(1,59) ¼ 24.3, Po0.0001, light power factor: F(1,59) ¼ 7.5,
P ¼ 0.008, genotype � light power factor: F(1,59) ¼ 1.1, P ¼ 0.30,
followed by post hoc comparisons). Similarly, so as to compare
the light-mediated HPI axis activation level of bPAC þ and
bPAC � larvae, we calculated ‘cortisol change’ as the ratio
between whole-body cortisol before and after (2 min) the light
pulse for each group. Cortisol change values across groups
showed that the magnitude of the light-mediated cortisol change
also depended on light power: the higher the power, the higher
the change, which was consistently greater in bPAC þ larvae,
thereby confirming previous results28 (Fig. 1d, bottom, two-way
ANOVA, genotype factor: F(1,32) ¼ 317.6, Po0.0001, light
power factor: F(1,32) ¼ 16.1, P ¼ 0.0003, genotype � light power
factor: F(1,32) ¼ 1.1, P ¼ 0.30, followed by post hoc comparisons).
Thus, the blue-light-mediated locomotor reduction and cortisol
increase in bPAC þ and bPAC � larvae were negatively correlated
to each other (Fig. 1e, Spearman’s rank correlation, Po0.0001,
r ¼ � 1.0). To rule out the possibility that the observed
differences
in
light-mediated
motion
and
cortisol
change
between bPAC þ and bPAC � larvae were due to non-specific
effects of light on other agents of the stress response, we
performed additional experiments following the same protocols
but now substituting blue for yellow light, as bPAC activation is
restricted to blue-light illumination26,27. Yellow light yielded
effects on motion and cortisol change similar to those of blue
light, but did not allow for a further group distinction between
bPAC þ and bPAC � larvae as it was the case with blue light
(Supplementary Fig. 4). In sum, only blue light strengthened
locomotor reactions and further increased whole-body cortisol in
bPAC þ larvae. Also, for bPAC þ larvae, the magnitude of the
blue-light-dependent elevation of cortisol increased with light
power and exposure time. We concluded that the enhanced
activity level of pituitary corticotroph cells was sufficient for
inducing differences in endocrine and locomotor reactions to
light between both groups of larvae.
Corticotroph cells aid in rapidly coping with threats. The light-
mediated locomotor reduction occurring in wild-type and bPAC
larvae in response to either blue or yellow light pointed to a
regulation of locomotion that aids in coping with threatening
stimuli by reducing threat exposure. To test this hypothesis, we
examined a larva’s choice between residing beneath filtered
(darkness) and unfiltered light (Fig. 2a, insert, light power, 0 and
1 mW cm � 2 for darkness and unfiltered blue light, respectively).
Briefly dark-adapted (wild-type) larvae actively avoided the
incidence of light when offered a choice between darkness and
unfiltered light (Fig. 2a, left, frequency distribution of time
intervals in light over 120 s, right, cumulative time spent under
blue light by individual larvae over a 120 s illumination period
(in %) relative to a maximum of 120 s; one-sample t-test against
50%, t(22) ¼ 6.2, Po0.0001). In bPAC siblings, this form of
choice depended on bPAC expression, and the wavelength and
power of the stimulating light. In response to blue light, bPAC �
larvae avoided the light irrespective of its power, as indicated by
their cumulative time spent in light, and, for a high-light power,
bPAC þ
larvae showed a greater preference for darkness.
Contrary to expectations, at a low-light power bPAC þ larvae did
not spend more time in darkness than in light (Fig. 2b, Two-tailed
t-test,

bPAC �,

P ¼ 0.005, 4.4 mW cm � 2, bPAC þ versus bPAC �, t(26) ¼ 2.2,

bPAC �,
t(12) ¼ 5.3,
P ¼ 0.0002,
bPAC þ,
t(14) ¼ 9.1, Po0.0001). However, a closer look into random
samples of equal size of the low-power data indicated that
bPAC þ larvae not only spent overall shorter intervals in light
during the 120 s period (Fig. 2c, Two-tailed t-tests, right,
t(18) ¼ 4.8, Po0.0001, left, t(18) ¼ 7.0, Po0.0001), indicative of a
strengthened light avoidance, but also moved more frequently in
the darkened half of the chamber, as indicated by the fact that
they transitioned to the illuminated half much more frequently
than bPAC �
larvae (Fig. 2d, two-tailed t-test, t(18) ¼ 8.6,
Po0.0001). Clearly, this enhanced locomotor activity in the
darkened half of the chamber persisted during the 120 s period in
spite of the several light exposures on the illuminated side. Since
the number of dark-to-light-transitions is representative of their
overall activity, these observations altogether pointed to higher
stimulus responsiveness and improved coping in bPAC þ larvae
as compared with their negative siblings.
Without a choice between darkness and light, that is, during
constant exposure to light after a brief period of dark-adaptation,
both wild-type and bPAC larvae shortened their steps and
increased their turns after the onset of either blue or yellow light,
thus reducing their overall swum distance. Remarkably, they
could also execute two distinctive behaviours. The first one was a
combination of negative geotaxis and thigmotaxis (henceforth
‘cloak’; Fig. 2e, top left). The second was a brief swimming burst
of high speed (henceforth ‘escape’; Fig. 2e, bottom left). These two
behaviours appeared hierarchically organized; in so far as that the
energetically less-costly cloak was more frequent than escape
(Supplementary Fig. 5) and both actions could occasionally be
observed alternating within a short time period. In bPAC siblings,
the probability of these behaviours also depended on bPAC
expression, and the wavelength and power of the stimulating
light. bPAC þ larvae responded to blue light of low power
primarily
with modified
locomotion (shortened
steps
and
increased turns), in line with the more frequent dark-to-light
transitions when offered a choice between filtered and unfiltered
low-power light (Fig. 2e, centre, G-test, P ¼ 0.003). As a result,
they on average showed less cloaks and escapes than bPAC �
larvae. By contrast, in response to blue light of higher power,
bPAC þ larvae displayed more frequent and lengthy escapes
than bPAC � larvae (Fig. 2e, right, G-test, P ¼ 0.0004, Fig. 2f,
two-tailed t-test, bPAC þ versus bPAC �, t(15) ¼ 3.5, P ¼ 0.004;
Supplementary Movies 4 and 5), in line with a greater preference
for darkness (less time spent in light) when offered a choice
between filtered and unfiltered light of high power. Yellow light
did not yield a similar distinction between bPAC siblings
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Both bPAC þ and bPAC � responded
in the same manner (as the bPAC � with blue light), with a
preference for darkness when offered a choice, irrespective of
light power and bPAC expression (Supplementary Fig. 6a).
Similarly, for light of low and higher power, both groups showed

 no difference concerning the frequency of cloaks and escapes, as
well as escape length (Supplementary Fig. 6b,c).
On the underlying assumption that a larva’s goal of reducing
the incidence of light is mediated by stimulus salience and
strength on the one side, and their capacity for threat detection
and mobilizing resources on the other, bPAC þ larvae appeared
to be better equipped to handle a threatening environment by
first seeking avoidance of the threat cue altogether, and if not
given a choice, by directly investing more resources into elaborate
cloaks and escapes. Thus, bPAC þ larvae showed an affinity
towards modified locomotor patterns at a low-light power, and
cloak and escape responses at a high-light power, coupled with
greater avoidance if given a choice. Cloak and escape presumably
require
more
resources
to
actively
sustain,
making
these
responses
more
demanding.
For
low-light
powers,
bPAC
activation might better prepare larvae to tolerate low-level
threats, whereas at a high-light power they will still be able to
allocate a vaster capacity towards the potentially more efficient
escape.
Increased stimulus responsiveness under stress. To test if
stressor exposure leads to increased stimulus responsiveness in
larval zebrafish, we developed two novel behavioural assays with a
focus on measuring responsiveness to different sensory stimuli,
and assessments of both avoidance and attraction. In addition, to
better pinpoint effects invariant to stressor identity, we used three
different stimulations eliciting avoidance reactions and cortisol
increase in a stimulus intensity-dependent manner: exposure to
either light, hyperosmotic medium or strong hydrodynamic flows
(Fig. 3a, see also refs 28,33). To compare the level of HPI axis
activation produced by these stimulations, we first measured
whole-body cortisol in wild-type larvae directly after stressor
exposure. Cortisol values across groups of pre-exposed (stressed)
larvae had nearly equal distributions and were, on average,
B230% higher than those of unexposed larvae (Fig. 3b, one-way
ANOVA,
F(4,54) ¼ 16.4,
Po0.0001,

NaCl: t(10) ¼ 8.6, Po0.0001, strong flows: t(10) ¼ 7.9, Po0.0001).
Next, in the first assay, we determined the link between stressor
exposure and the subsequent reaction of a freely swimming larva
encountering a higher surrounding water temperature. We
monitored the movements of single larvae swimming in darkness
in a small, cylindrical chamber with an opposing in and outlet
before and after a sharp temperature increase of the flowing
medium, which, owing to the layout of the chamber and heat
conduction, led to a significant temperature difference between
the inlet (high temperature, zone 1) and outlet (low temperature,
zone 2) area (Fig. 3c, see also Supplementary Fig. 7c and see the
‘Methods’ section). After the onset of temperature rise, larvae
entering the high-temperature area reacted to an increasing
surrounding temperature with fast turns and greater swim
velocity (Fig. 3d). To quantify their overall response, we measured
‘differential speed’ (DS) as the difference (in %) between the swim
velocity (mm � (40 ms) � 1) in zone 1 and 2 for each larva, or

 ((swim velocity in zone 1 � swim velocity in zone 2)/swim
velocity in zone 2) � 100, before (30 s) and after (60–90 s) the
onset of the temperature rise (see also the ‘Methods’ section). The
distribution of DS values across groups revealed that unexposed
larvae displayed only slightly modified locomotion patterns in
zones 1 and 2 after the onset of temperature rise, whereas larvae
pre-exposed to stressors had nearly equally distributed DS values
that were, on average, 316% higher than those of unexposed
larvae (Fig. 3e, top, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, time
factor: F(1,60) ¼ 246.2, Po0.0001, treatment factor: F(4,60) ¼ 5.6,
P ¼ 0.0006, time � treatment factor: F(4,60) ¼ 7.0, P ¼ 0.0001,
followed by post hoc comparisons).
In the second assay, we applied subtle hydrodynamic stimuli to
similar groups of wild-type larvae (Fig. 3a). Hydrodynamic
sensing provides fish with various benefits, ranging from object
detection to sensing conspecifics34. Larval zebrafish, for instance,
respond to local, non-stressful water motions (WMs) with
positive taxis and reduced locomotion35. The onset of WMs
first leads them to approach the stimulus source and reduce their
locomotion gradually; they then remain virtually immobile in the
proximity of the source as long as WMs persist (Fig. 3f). This
response is highly sensitive to stimulus frequency and strength,
sensory background and rearing conditions35, and offers an
excellent
handle for
assessing subtle
changes in
stimulus
responsiveness. To quantify a larva’s response to WMs, we
focused on the WM-induced locomotion reduction and measured
integrals of distance swum every 40 ms for equal periods before
and during WMs for each larva (see the ‘Methods’ section).
The
distribution
of
motion
values
across
groups
showed
responses for pre-exposed larvae that were, on average, 20%
greater than those of unexposed larvae, consistent with the idea
that increased stimulus responsiveness follows stressor exposure
(Fig. 3g, two-way repeated measures ANOVA, time factor:
F(1,70) ¼ 402.9,

P ¼ 0.41,

factor:
F(4,70) ¼ 2.2,

followed by post hoc comparisons). Taken together, these
results indicated that the various stressors produced positively
correlated changes in cortisol, DS and motion values.
Using bPAC siblings, we then tested if bPAC activation in
corticotroph cells influences stressor-mediated levels of stimulus
responsiveness. To test this possibility, we determined whether
bPAC þ and bPAC � larvae pre-exposed to either blue or yellow
light were equally reactive to increasing water temperature
and WMs (Fig. 4a). As expected, both blue and yellow light
increased whole-body cortisol in bPAC þ and bPAC � larvae,
and the resulting levels were significantly higher (42%) in
bPAC þ larvae only after blue-light exposure (Fig. 4b, two-way
ANOVA, genotype factor: F(1,54) ¼ 7.5, P ¼ 0.008, treatment
factor: F(2,54) ¼ 91.9, Po0.0001, genotype � treatment factor:
F(2,54) ¼ 5.3, P ¼ 0.008, followed by post hoc comparisons).
Notably, DS and motion values showed (a) that unexposed
bPAC þ and bPAC � larvae responded similarly to increasing
surrounding water temperature and WMs, (b) that blue and
yellow light increased their responses as in wild-type larvae and
(c) that bPAC þ larvae had much greater responses than bPAC �
larvae only after blue-light exposure (Fig. 4c,d, two-way repeated

Discussion
The
difficult
in
vivo
accessibility
of
the
hypothalamus
and pituitary gland, and the rapid and synchronous release of
stress-sensitive modulators have made it difficult to determine the
contribution
of
distinct
HPA-axis
effectors
on
immediate
reactions to stress. Zebrafish offer a highly in vivo accessible
and easy-to-handle model for HPA signalling at the same time
as a high physiological and neuroanatomical homology to
mammals. The zebrafish HPI axis shares conspicuous homologies
with the HPA axis in humans25 and the larval neurosecretory
preoptic-hypothalamic
area
is
also
homologous
to
the
hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus in mammals36. Notably,
the HPI axis matures very early in development from 4 d.p.f.
onwards37–39 and its principal cell clusters can be visualized and
manipulated using genetic tools (Supplementary Movie 1).
Furthermore, as in mammals, stressors induce predictable
alterations in the locomotor activity and feeding drive of freely
behaving larvae28,33 (see also Supplementary Discussion). Our
findings uncover fast organizing effects of pituitary corticotroph
cells
on
behaviour,
providing
direct
evidence
that
rapid
behavioural
adjustments
on
stressor
exposure
can
occur
depending on the activity level of pituitary corticotrophs. The
results are consistent with literature pointing to joint actions of
brain neuropeptides and peripheral hormones8 and suggest that a
higher level of endocrine pituitary cell activity post onset of stress
can yield an advantage in coping with acutely threatening
environments.
Although CRH has been shown to elicit rapid behavioural
effects10, its involvement alone does not account for the
differences between bPAC þ and bPAC � larvae in the range of
responses examined here. Experiments using the same protocols
but with yellow light failed to produce the same group differences
as blue light yielded for the wavelength-specific activation of
bPAC in bPAC þ larvae. This failure further dissociates general
effects of light as a stressor from those specific to bPAC
activation, namely enhanced cAMP-mediated Ca2 þ levels in
corticotroph cells preceding a higher level of corticotroph output
and eventually resulting in higher whole-body cortisol. Without
the bPAC-mediated corticotroph output modification, endocrine
and behavioural end points showed similar values between groups
for yellow light. Light as a stressor thus fails to account for a
distinction between bPAC þ and bPAC � larvae.
Significant differences between both groups emerged with blue
light, in line with the idea that the group differences did not result
from the initial activity level of the hypothalamic–pituitary unit,
but from downstream processes. We had shown in bPAC þ
larvae that blue light can be used as both a potent stressor and a
means to enhance pituitary corticotroph cell activity, thus
prompting a higher cortisol level28. The fact that light in this
dual
role
can
be
accurately
controlled
is
important
in
understanding
how
distinct
stress
modulators
influence
behaviour immediately after the onset of stress, since the
combined effects of HPA-axis effectors can occur at short
timescales. Compared with controls, bPAC þ larvae showed
locomotion changes occurring just seconds after the light onset,
and a few seconds later they also showed adjustments in
avoidance
behaviours,
followed
by
greater
stimulus
responsiveness after the light offset; clearly, the speed of these
effects
speaks
against
innocuous
effects
of
the
amplified
corticotroph cell activity.
Studies in mammals showed that injections of ACTH and
related peptides can alter forms of avoidance20,40,41, stretching
and yawning42, grooming43 and sexually motivated actions44;
thus a role for pituitary peptides in regulating arousal has
been suggested45. Evidence also shows that glucocorticoid
administration
can
influence
locomotion22,46,
agonistic
reactions47–49 and courtship23,50,51. These studies relied on
injections of exogenous hormones and behavioural measures of
varying delays; rapid effects of endogenous effectors from the
pituitary–adrenal unit have not been documented before. The
change in Ca2 þ-dependent photo-emission and whole-body
cortisol gave direct evidence that light activated the HPI axis of
the zebrafish larva, prompting the rapid release of corticotroph
and steroidogenic interrenal cell products. Our findings thus
agree with previous studies and extend those for the first time
towards rapid effects of endogenous corticotroph cell products on
behaviour.
The blue-light-dependent behavioural adjustments in bPAC þ
larvae may set in once the activity of either corticotroph or
interrenal cells, or both, is enhanced. Active molecules have
been ascribed to both cell types. Corticotrophs produce several
active peptides resulting from the cleavage and processing
of the precursor gene POMC, like ACTH, pro-g-melanocyte-
stimulating-hormone (MSH) and b-lipotrophin (LPH). b-LPH is
further cleaved to b-endorphin and a proportion of ACTH can be
cleaved to a-MSH and corticotrophin-like intermediate peptide52.
These POMC-derived peptides can lead to behavioural change

 when injected into rats, and ACTH fragments like ACTH 1–10
and ACTH 4–10, also present in a-MSH, b-MSH and b-LPH,
have similar effects on avoidance as ACTH itself21. Moreover,
ACTH fragments devoid of adrenal function can prompt
behavioural changes as well, suggestive of a central role for
pituitary-derived peptides that may be transported back to the
brain53, although central mechanisms underlying rapid effects of
pituitary peptides on behaviour have not yet been reported.
In fish, behavioural effects of POMC-derived peptides have
been studied primarily in the context of food intake and
pigmentation54, but not in that of stress. ACTH stimulates the
release of steroids from the adrenal cortex via the MC2R.
Evidence indicates that the expression of MC2R is restricted to
the adrenal cortex, although conflicting results have been
reported concerning the role of ACTH in the release of
epinephrine
and
norepinephrine
by
cells
in
the
adrenal
medulla55,56. The interrenal gland of teleosts does not have a
strict separation between cortex and medulla. In larval zebrafish,
steroidogenic and catecholaminergic cells are intermingled,
and
MC2R
expression
is
restricted
to
steroidogenic
cells
(Supplementary
Fig.
2).
In
mammals,
the
adrenal
cortex
produces glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and androgens. In
teleosts, steroidogenic cells produce mainly cortisol, responsible
for glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid actions. Ultradian and
circadian57,58 as well as stress-induced glucocorticoid variations
have wide-reaching cellular correlates. Glucocorticoid actions in a
number of brain regions involve membrane-bound and nuclear
forms of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors, as well
as a yet unidentified G-protein-coupled receptor (reviewed in
refs 59,60). Despite these advances, how glucocorticoids, and
hypothalamic and anterior pituitary neuropeptides interact with
each other to activate and inactivate stress-sensitive processes
across multiple time windows still remains unclear.
In this study, we uncovered reversible phenotypic adaptations
attributable to enhanced corticotroph cell activity immediately
after the onset of stress. In addition, we added a series of robust
assays to a growing repertoire of laboratory tests in larval
zebrafish. Genetic tools to modify hypothalamic, corticotroph and
steroidogenic cell function are being developed28,61,62 and can be
combined with optogenetics, pharmacology and behavioural
screens to specify distinct actions of HPA-axis hormones and
downstream effectors.
Methods
Zebrafish husbandry and handling. Zebrafish breeding and maintenance were
performed under standard conditions63. Embryos were collected in the morning
and raised on a 12:12 light/dark cycle in E2 medium (wild-type and bPAC larvae),
or in E3 medium with 0.2 mM N-phenylthiourea (PTU, Sigma-Aldrich, #P7629;
GFP-Aequorin larvae), at 28 �C. To avoid unspecific activation of bPAC before the
tests, transgenic and control embryos were raised inside custom-made reflective
containers covered with 550 nm long-pass filters (Thorlabs, Dachau, Germany;
Supplementary Fig. 3a). All experiments were carried out with wild-type or
transgenic larvae at 4–6 d.p.f. Tests were performed between 09:00 hours and 18:00
hours, with different experimental groups intermixed throughout the day.
Zebrafish experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines
of the German animal welfare law and approved by the local government
(Regierungspra
¨sidium Karlsruhe; G-29/12).
Transgenic lines. Tg(Pomc:bPAC-2A-tdTomato)hd10 fish (bPAC)28 were crossed
with wild-type fish (cross of AB and TL strains, AB/TL) and their progenies
maintained in E2 medium and screened (without anaesthetics) for pituitary-
specific tdTomato expression (bPAC þ), or its absence (bPAC �), at 3–5 d.p.f., at
least 1 day before behavioural or cortisol tests. All screenings were performed using
a Leica MZ6 fluorescence microscope. To generate the pomc:GFP-Aequorin
construct, an B1 kb DNA region, upstream of the start codon of the zebrafish
pomc gene29 was PCR-amplified using the forward primer 50-GGATTAATCTG
CTTTAAGACCTCAATTTTTGAGAC-30 and the reverse primer 50-AAAGCTAG
CCACTCCCCTCACCATCTCTGAGA-30. The forward primer included an Ase1
restriction site while the reverse primer included a Nhe1-restriction site. The
amplified pomc promoter fragment was used to replace the CMV promoter of the
pG5A vector31, which contains Aequorin fused in frame at the 30-end of the EGFP
with a 5 amino acid linker between GFP and apoaequorin. The recombinant
plasmid was injected into one-cell stage AB/TL wild-type embryos at 10 ng ml � 1
concentration in the presence of 10 ng ml � 1 Tol2 transposase mRNA and 0.05%
phenol red (Sigma-Aldrich, #P3532). The progenies of injected fish were
maintained in egg water supplemented with 0.2 mM PTU to prevent pigmentation
and screened for pituitary-specific GFP expression at 2–4 d.p.f. A single G0 founder
was used to establish a stable F1 family for Tg(Pomc:GFP-Aequorin)hd20.
Tg(Pomc:bPAC-2A-tdTomato)hd10 and Tg(Pomc:GFP-Aequorin)hd20 fish were
crossed and raised in E3 medium plus 0.2 mM PTU and screened for pituitary-
specific co-expression of tdTomato and GFP (bPAC þ/GFP-Aequorin þ) or single
expression of GFP (bPAC �/GFP-Aequorin þ) at 3 d.p.f.
Staining and microscopy. Riboprobes for the steroidogenic acute regulatory pro-
tein (star)64 and mc2r were synthesized from linearized plasmids following
instructions provided with the digoxygenin-labelling mix (Roche, #11277073910).
Whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were
performed as described elsewhere65,66, using a primary rabbit antibody labelling
tyrosine hydroxylase67(1:250) and the secondary anti-rabbit antibody Alexa 647
(Invitrogen, #A-21245, 1:1,000). For imaging, specimens were cleared in 80%
glycerol (Gerbu, #2006) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. Confocal stacks were
recorded using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a Nikon 20 � glycerol
objective. In vivo images of cell populations forming the three elements of the HPI
axis were recorded using specific transgenic expression in stable lines and in situ
cell type mapping. Transgenic larvae expressing OtpECR6:RFPcaax61, pomc:GFP29
and StAR:GFP62 were embedded in 1% low-melt agar (Roth, #6351) and imaged
in vivo using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 20 � water objective (see also
Supplementary Methods). Stacks were evaluated using Amira 5.4 (FEI
Visualization Sciences Group) to create maximum intensity projections and
rotation videos, and spatially restricted to the volume of interest, excluding signals
from planes in front or behind. Brightness and contrast were adjusted for each
channel.
Setup. Video recordings using blue and yellow light, hydrochloric acid (HCl,
Merck, #109063), rising temperature and non-stressful WMs were made under
infrared illumination delivered through a custom-made array of infrared-LEDs
mounted inside a light-proof enclosure. Custom-made drivers, amplifiers, pulse
generators and a TTL control box (USB-IO box, Noldus Information Technology,
Wageningen, The Netherlands) allowed computer control of blue- and yellow-light
illumination, pH level and mechanosensory stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 7a).
Larvae were imaged through infrared-sensitive cameras, at either 25 (ICD-49E
B/W, Ikegami Tsushinki Co, Ltd, Japan) or 100 frames s � 1 (Firewire Camera,
Noldus Information Technology), with a lens (TV Lens, Computer VARI FOCAL
H3Z4512 CS-IR, CBC; Commak, NY, USA) positioned above a cylindrical custom-
made swimming chamber (Supplementary Fig. 7b). The complete setup was placed
on a vibration-free platform (Newport Corp, Irvine, CA, USA). EthoVision XT 7
software (Noldus Information Technology) was used to monitor the movements of
individually swimming larvae. Motion values from video recordings made at 25
and 100 frames s � 1 were expressed as distance swum every 40 (mm per 40 ms) and
10 ms (mm per 10 ms), respectively. The swimming chamber (internal diameter:
10 mm, height: 10 mm) had a transparent bottom and two opposite overtures, inlet
and outlet (width: 2.5 mm, height: 400 mm; Supplementary Fig. 7c, top), allowing
medium (E2 or E3) to constantly flow at 200 ml min � 1 by means of a peristaltic
pump (IPC Ismatec, IDEX Health and Science GmbH, Wertheim, Germany).
The chamber also had two cylindrical side channels (internal diameter: 400 mm)
opposite to each other opening 200 mm above the transparent glass bottom, with
their longest axis oriented at an angle of 30� relative to horizontal (Supplementary
Fig. 7c, bottom). One such channel held a thermocouple (TS200, npi electronics
GmbH, Tamm, Germany) monitoring the temperature inside the chamber and
providing feedback to a control system (PTC 20, npi electronics GmbH; Exos-2 V2
liquid cooling system, Koolance, Auburn, WA, USA) that either kept the flowing
medium at 28 �C (±0.1 �C) or increased its temperature rapidly in a highly con-
trolled manner (see below). The second side channel allowed passage of the end of
a rigid silica capillary tube, or stimulus source (outer diameter: 350 mm, full length:
25 mm, Polymicro Technologies), submerged B400 mm into the chamber’s inner
medium (depth: 5 mm). The opposite end of the capillary tube was fixed to a
multilayer bender actuator (PICMA PL140.10, Physik Instrumente (PI)
GmbH þ Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) with an operating voltage of 0–60 V, a
maximum displacement of ±1,000 mm and an unloaded resonant frequency of
160 Hz. The bender, coupled to a pulse generator, a dual piezo amplifier and a TTL
control system, produced unidirectional lateral displacements (of 50 mm and
controllable speed) of the capillary’s submerged end, creating minute, non-stressful
WMs within the chamber. The input voltage applied to the actuator (0.5 V)
determined the speed of the capillary’s lateral displacements35. To monitor a larva’s
response to a pH drop, a computer-controlled perfusion system (Octaflow, ALA
Scientific Instruments, Inc, Farmingdale, NY, USA) injected 2 ml of HCl solution
(250 mM) into a cylindrical mixing compartment (internal diameter: 1 mm)
situated 10 mm from the inlet of the swimming chamber. The mixing compartment
was connected to a reservoir of HCl solution coupled to a computer-controlled
solenoid valve via Teflon tubing (internal diameter: 230 mm, outer diameter:

 600 mm). TTL signals triggered the opening and closing of the valve (time: 1 s,
pressure: 1 p.s.i.), allowing the HCl solution to be well mixed with the flowing
medium before reaching the inner chamber. For blue- and yellow-light
illumination, a computer-controlled custom LED ring surrounding the camera lens
was positioned at a fixed distance above the swimming chamber (Supplementary
Fig. 7d). The incident angle of the LEDs allowed for homogeneous illumination of
the chamber’s inner compartment. Each squared pulse of light of varying duration
consisted of 100 ms flashes delivered at 5 Hz. Light power was measured through a
hand-held light power meter (Newport Corp, Irvine, CA, USA). All experiments
involved single larvae, which moved freely within the chamber and were given an
initial time period of 10 min to adapt to the chamber’s conditions before tests.
Stressors. Groups of thirty larvae in 30 mm Petri dishes were exposed to three
different protocols based on either blue or yellow light, NaCl or strong
hydrodynamic flows and used for cortisol measurement or transferred to the
custom-made swimming chamber for behavioural testing. Blue or yellow light:
dark-adapted larvae were exposed to a 180 s squared pulse of either blue or yellow
light as described above. Light power, 2.8 mW cm � 2. NaCl: larvae were incubated
for 10 min in steady-state E2 þ 50 mM NaCl (NaCl50mM, Merck, #106404) medium
at 28 �C under white-light illumination. They were then washed three times with
E2 medium. Strong hydrodynamic flows: larvae were presented with strong flows
caused by rapid 1 mm lateral displacements of the end of a rigid silica capillary tube
fixed to a multilayer piezo bender actuator (input voltage: 6 V), as described
elsewhere33. The end of the capillary was submerged 2 mm into the medium at the
centre of a 35 mm Petri dish half filled (1.8 ml) with E2 medium (orientation
relative to water surface: 90�). Larvae were exposed to 6 stimulation units delivered
with an inter-stimulation-interval of 250 ms. Each unit consisted of 99 repetitions
of 40 ms lateral displacements. Stimulations were carried out at 28 �C under white
illumination.
Whole-body cortisol. Groups of thirty larvae were immobilized in ice water 120 s
after exposure to light, NaCl or strong flows. Control samples were collected after
equal handling, omitting stressor exposure. Samples were then frozen in an etha-
nol/dry-ice bath and stored at � 20 �C for subsequent extraction. Cortisol
extraction and detection were carried out using a home-made cortisol ELISA
protocol, as described elsewhere68.
Recordings. Before recordings, single larvae were kept inside the chamber
swimming in E2 medium at 28 �C (±0.1 �C) under infrared light for 10 min. They
were then exposed to either blue or yellow light, rising temperature or local WMs
and their behaviour was video-recorded as described above.
Light avoidance. One half of the swimming chamber was covered with a single
layer of long-pass filter foil. The resulting light power in the filtered chamber-half
was reduced to 0.007–0.012% at 488 nm and 0.003–0.007% at 570 nm, relative to
the unfiltered half (2.8 mW cm � 2), as measured with a light power meter (see
above). Groups of five larvae were video-recorded while swimming freely for 3 min
under infrared illumination only, and then presented with a 120 s pulse of either
blue or yellow light. Incidences of a larva entering the illuminated side of the
chamber were manually scored for timing and duration. Frequency and cumulative
time spent in light were calculated over the course of the 120 s light phase for each
larva.
Definition and scoring of ‘cloak’ and ‘escape’. Cloak was defined as a tilted
position of the body axis with the head facing up towards the LED ring and the
body touching the walls of the chamber, that is, negative geotaxis plus thigmotaxis.
Escape reactions were defined as fast swimming bouts along the chamber’s wall at
speeds that defied valid EthoVision XT 7 tracking because the larva was invisible in
multiple subsequent videos frames (frame rate: 100 Hz). The end of an escape bout
was defined as the first frame in which the larva had slowed down to traceable
speed or halted motion entirely. Occurrence, latency and duration of cloak and
escape were scored manually for individual larvae during the entire 120 s of either
blue or yellow light in each video.
Rising temperature. Single larvae were video-recorded for 240 s with the
temperature of the flowing medium kept at 28 �C (±0.1 �C). The input of the
temperature control system was then stepped up by 10 �C, causing the temperature
of the flowing medium to reach 34 �C after 120 s. The rising temperature produced
a temperature difference between the inlet and outlet, zones 1 (high temperature)
and 2 (low temperature), respectively, which reached its maximum 60–90 s after
the onset of temperature increase (300–330 s of the whole recording session),
a time window used to measure ‘differential speed’.
Local WMs. Single larvae in the swimming chamber were video-recorded for 120 s
under infrared light and constant temperature. Next, they were presented with 1 ms
lateral displacements of the silica capillary tube delivered at 1 Hz (input voltage:
0.5 V) for 120 s, as described elsewhere35. Motion before and during stimulation
was calculated using the integrals of motion over 120 s.
Bioluminescence. Coelentrazine (CLNZ; Synchem, #s053) was prepared as a
10 mM stock solution in (2-Hydroxypropyl)-b-cyclodextrin (Tocris, #0708) with
11.25% propylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich, #398039). The stock solution was diluted
to a final working concentration of 40 mM CLNZ in E3 medium. On the evening of
3 d.p.f., bPAC þ/GFP-Aequorin þ and bPAC �/GFP-Aequorin þ larvae were
dark-incubated in CLNZ solution at 25 �C; the CLNZ solution was replaced with a
freshly diluted stock every 24 h. At 6 d.p.f., they were washed four times in E3
medium and transferred in groups of 7 into a swimming chamber similar to that
shown in Supplementary Fig. 7b (with neither in nor outlet) filled with E3 medium
only. The chamber remained below the LED ring (as shown in Supplementary
Fig. 7d) with its transparent glass bottom fixed 1.5 mm above a photomultiplier
tube (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Shizuoka, Japan) covered with a custom-made
TTL-controlled shutter and mounted inside a light-proof enclosure placed
on a vibration-free platform. The shutter remained closed at all times until
bioluminescence was measured. CLNZ-incubated larvae were first allowed to swim
freely for 240 s and then exposed to a 120 s square pulse of either blue or
yellow light (100 ms flashes delivered at 5 Hz, light power: 2.8 mW cm � 2).
Photo-emission was measured with the photomultiplier tube at 1 Hz for 60 s
immediately after the light offset.
Statistics. All data are shown as single measurement points or mean and standard
error of the mean. We used a random experimental design, Spearman’s rank
correlations, Student’s t-tests (two-tailed) for two-group comparisons, one-sample
t-tests, G-tests and ANOVAs for multiple group comparisons (followed by
Bonferroni’s post hoc tests), or their non-parametric equivalents. Normality was
tested using Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Shapiro–Wilk and D’Agostino tests. Analyses
were made with EthoVision XT 7 (Noldus Information Technology), Matlab 2009b
(MathWorks, Inc, Natick, MA; USA), MS-Excel (Microsoft Corp; Redmond, WA,
USA), Prism 5 (Graphpad Software Inc, San Diego, CA, USA), Sigma Plot (Systat
Software Inc, San Jose, CA, USA), ImageJ (Freeware) and VirtualDub (Freeware).
