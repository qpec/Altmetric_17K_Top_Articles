ABSTRACT
Some people have a gender which is neither male nor female and may identify as both male and
female at one time, as different genders at different times, as no gender at all, or dispute the very
idea of only two genders. The umbrella terms for such genders are ‘genderqueer’ or ‘non-binary’
genders. Such gender identities outside of the binary of female and male are increasingly being
recognized in legal, medical and psychological systems and diagnostic classifications in line with
the emerging presence and advocacy of these groups of people. Population-based studies show a
small percentage – but a sizable proportion in terms of raw numbers – of people who identify as
non-binary. While such genders have been extant historically and globally, they remain
marginalized, and as such – while not being disorders or pathological in themselves – people
with such genders remain at risk of victimization and of minority or marginalization stress as a
result of discrimination. This paper therefore reviews the limited literature on this field and
considers ways in which (mental) health professionals may assist the people with genderqueer and
non-binary gender identities and/or expressions they may see in their practice. Treatment options
and associated risks are discussed.

Introduction
Gender is often considered to come in two forms – male
(masculine) or female (feminine). Indeed, it is frequently
elided with physical sex such that when a person is
assigned a female sex at birth – through visual inspection
of their external genitals – it is assumed that their gender
too will be female; that they will likely be feminine (their
gender role); and that they will most likely be sexually
attracted to men when they reach sexual maturity. Of
course, this series of inferences is correspondingly made
with men - linking sex to gender, to gender role, to
sexuality. It is a trivial assertion, however, to say that
these inferences are not invariably correct. For example,
male people may be attracted to other male people;
people assigned male at birth may have a female gender
identity; and people assigned female may have a male
gender identity but, for pragmatic reasons, have a female
gender role (Richards & Barker, 2013, 2015).
All these acknowledged variations nonetheless still
presuppose a binary system of male and female, albeit
that ‘male’ and ‘female’ here may be expressed in
different
ways,
e.g.
as
gender,
sex,
gender
role.
Notwithstanding
this,
people
with
an
intersex
or
diversity/disorder of sexual development (DSD) condi-
tion (APA, 2013a) will have physical sexual character-
istics which fall outside of this binary (Roen, 2015);
although the majority of people with this range of
conditions do still identify their gender within the binary –
as men or as women (Harper, 2007; Richards & Barker,
2013).
In contrast to this, there are a significant number of
people who do not have an (observable) intersex/DSD
condition, but who nonetheless identify outside of the
gender binary. Such non-binary gender identity or
expression has been present over time and across
different global cultures (Herdt, 1996).
In the current Western context, however, some people
may identify as predominantly male, but with aspects of
the ‘other’ gender and use the identity term ‘male’
generally; or may identify as predominantly female, but
with aspects of the ‘other’ gender and use the identity
term ‘female’ generally – but both groups of people may
define additionally as ‘genderqueer’ when necessary – for
example in accepting environments or when neither a
male nor female identity suits. Those people who
incorporate aspects of both male and female, but who

 have a fixed identity, may identify as ‘androgynous’,
‘mixed gender’ or sometimes ‘pangender’ as the latter is a
flexible term. In contrast, people who move between
genders in a fluid way may identify as ‘bigender’, ‘gender
fluid’ or sometimes ‘pangender’ again. Some people
move between more than two genders and so identify as
‘trigender’, and sometimes ‘pangender’ as it is a flexible
term. Some people identify as a specific additional
gender (either between female and male or otherwise
additional to those genders) and identify as ‘third
gender’, ‘other gender’, and sometimes again as ‘pan-
gender’. Then there are those people who disrupt the
gender dichotomy though challenging its very ontology
and/or veracity and so identify as ‘genderqueer’ or
‘genderfuck’. And there are also people who have no
gender and so identify as ‘agender’, ‘gender neutral’,
‘non-gendered’, ‘genderless’, ‘neuter’, or ‘neutrois’.
An example of this is present in Bockting (2008) who
found in the course of a US online study a variety of
identities amongst 1229 transgender individuals that
were not reconcilable with a binary understanding of sex.
These included ‘shemale, bigender, two-spirit, gender
neutral, genderless, androgyne, ambiguous, intergen-
dered, third gender, pan-, poly- or omni-gendered,
dynamically gendered, gender fluid, nonbiological inter-
sexed, in-between and beyond’ (Bockting, 2008, p. 214).
In her qualitative study, Hines (2007) quotes such
further non-binary identities as ‘gender terrorist, intersex
by design, intentional mutation, hermaphrodyke, queer
trannie boy’ (Hines, 2007, p. 80). All of the above terms
are often subsumed within the umbrella terms of ‘non-
binary’ or ‘genderqueer’ identities. In this emerging field
terms are likely to change, however, and, as usual, we
should attend to people’s own preferred terms when
undertaking clinical work. Moreover, it is important to
use people’s preferred pronouns (in addition to names
and terms for gender). Some non-binary people use they/
their/them/themselves or an explicitly developed term
such as xe/xyr/xem/xyrself rather than he/his/him/him-
self or she/her/her/herself. With all these aspects, ‘ask’
etiquette is appropriate (Richards & Barker, 2013) which
simply involves asking what terminology people prefer
and how they experience their gender. This move
towards a more accepting and accommodating approach
towards non-binary and genderqueer people is mirrored
in generally more favourable media reporting within the
global North and West, especially in online and youth
oriented media. Within mainstream media there is still a
tendency towards a perhaps patronizing ‘interest’ which
situates non-binary and genderqueer people as ‘other’ to
the assumed norm of the viewer – something which can
be tiring for these minority groups (Sue, 2010).
This paper then, consists of a necessarily extremely
brief overview of the current psychiatric literature
pertaining to such non-binary or genderqueer identities
as these have formed the basis of the literature until now.
It then considers how (mental) health professionals
might assist these groups of people within clinical
practice in a non-pathologizing manner, which recog-
nizes the pressures and needs of this group of people at
this time in history.
Prevalence of non-binary people
Two population studies have aimed to estimate the
prevalence of people who identify as non-binary. Kuyper
& Wijsen (2014) examined self-reported gender identity
and dysphoria in a large Dutch population sample
(N ¼ 8064, aged 15–70 years old), and found that 4.6% of
people assigned male at birth and 3.2% of people
assigned female at birth reported an ‘ambivalent gender
identity’ (defined as equal identification with the other
sex as with the sex assigned to them at birth) and 1.1% of
people assigned male at birth and 0.8% of people
assigned female at birth reported an ‘incongruent gender
identity’ (defined as stronger identification with the
other sex as with the sex assigned to them at birth).
Recently, Van Caenegem et al. (2015) reported results
based on two population-based surveys, one of 1832
Flemish individuals and one of 2472 sexual minority
individuals in Flanders, Belgium, examining the preva-
lence of ‘gender incongruence’ (defined as identifying
stronger with the other sex than with the sex assigned at
birth) and ‘gender ambivalence’ (defined as identifying
equally with the other sex as with the sex assigned at
birth). Their findings showed that the prevalence of
‘gender ambivalence’ or non-binary gender was 1.8% in
natal men and 4.1% in natal women.
In terms of trans populations more specifically, one
UK study found that 5% of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans
and Questioning (LGBTQ) youth identified as neither
male nor female (METRO Youth Chances, 2014); a US
study found that 13% of trans people surveyed were ‘a
gender not listed here’ (Harrison et al., 2012, p. 14); and
a Scottish study on trans mental health (McNeil et al.,
2012) found that over a quarter of survey participants
identified as non-binary.
Turning to wider gender experience and expression,
rather than specific identities, it seems that the figures
are likely to be much higher. Joel et al. (2013) surveyed
people in the general population in Israel and found that,
out of 2225 participants, over 35% felt that they were to
some extent the ‘other’ gender, ‘both’ genders, and/or
neither gender.

 These are clearly significant proportions of people;
however, comparatively few appear to seek any form of
assistance at gender identity clinics. For example, in Beek
et al. (unpublished), out of 360 applicants for gender
reassignment treatments only four explicitly stated that
their non-binary identity was their motivation for
treatment. This may, of course, be related to the
number of non-binary people who feel able to be open
about their identities in such settings.
Human rights and legislation for non-binary
people
Many of the non-binary groups of people listed above
will use their birth-assigned gender as a matter of
necessity in day-to-day business and bureaucracy due to
the fact that many systems (including health systems)
and social circles only recognize binary genders. This is
changing, however. For example the European Union’s
Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Resolution
2048 6.2.4 recommends that European Parliaments
‘Consider including a third gender option in identity
documents for those who seek it’ (Council of Europe,
2015). Similarly, the United Nations’ (UN) General
Assembly
Report
of
the
United
Nations
High
Commissioner for Human Rights Discriminatory laws
and practices and acts of violence against individuals
based on their sexual orientation and gender identity
(United Nations, 2015) advocates for fair treatment of
LGBT people in all UN member states and notes that:
The terms lesbian, gay and bisexual and transgender are
used throughout the report, but often abbreviated to
LGBT. These terms are used to refer to same-sex
behaviour, identities or relationships and non-binary
gender identities. (United Nations, 2015, p. 4; italics not
in the original.)
Thus the report includes non-binary people within
its purview and consequently within international law.
Notably, holders of New Zealand passports may already
have their gender marked as male (M), female (F), or as
neither male nor female (X). More broadly, organiza-
tions from Facebook to the United Kingdom’s Royal
Mail are including non-binary genders as gender options
for their customers. It follows, therefore, that health
professionals should attend to this cultural shift in their
work.
Diagnostic classification concerning non-binary
people
This trend toward acceptance, as well as a greater
understanding of the diversity of gender, has been
reflected within the context of mental health care as in
the
last
revision
to
the
American
Psychiatric
Association’s (APA, 2013a) Diagnostic and statistical
manual fifth edition (DSM-5). The DSM-5 removed the
DSM IV-TR (APA, 2000) diagnosis of gender identity
disorder which considered wishing to change one’s
gender to be a disorder and only recognized the gender
binary of male and female. The DSM-5 instead includes
the diagnosis of gender dysphoria which explicitly
recognizes that having a different gender is not a
disorder (APA, 2013b) and crucially includes the criteria:
�
4. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some
alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender)
�
5. A strong desire to be treated as the other gender
(or some alternative gender different from one’s
assigned gender)
�
6. A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings
and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative
gender different from one’s assigned gender). (APA,
2013a p. 452; italics not in the original.)
Thus non-binary genders are recognized with the APA’s
diagnostic taxonomy also. There are, of course, strong
arguments for removing diagnoses pertaining to gender
from the DSM entirely as there are no higher rates of
psychopathology in this demographic (Cole et al., 1997;
Colizzi et al., 2014; Haraldsen & Dahl, 2000; Hill et al.,
2005; Hoshiai et al., 2010; Kersting et al., 2003; Simon et al.,
2011). Of course this does not include wider psychological
distress, most commonly minority or marginalization
stress, which is stress caused by being in a group which
is discriminated against and so may lead to psychopath-
ology – it is the discrimination rather than the membership
of this specific group which is psychopathogenic.
Nonetheless, gender diagnoses have been retained
predominantly for the purely pragmatic reason that
some people who do not remain in the gender they were
assigned at birth wish for interventions such that they
have a more holistically congruent self. This might
include such things as hormones, chest surgeries, and
genital surgeries of various sorts to give people a body
more in keeping with their gender; or psychological and
counselling assistance to assist with psychosocial transi-
tions (Richards et al., unpublished). Consequently the
World Health Organization’s (WHO) forthcoming revi-
sion of the International classification of diseases and
related health problems (ICD-11), which is expected to be
published in 2017 will likely remove the diagnostic
category ‘gender identity disorders’ from chapter V
(Mental and behavioural disorders) of the ICD-10
(WHO, 1992) (which again used a disorder and binary
gender model). The recommendation from the Working
Group on the Classification of Sexual Disorders and
Sexual Health is to replace it with a diagnosis of ‘gender

 incongruence’, which does not include the assumption of
disorder and again includes non-binary or genderqueer
identities. They further asserted that based on more
reflective and contemporary scientific evidence and best
practice there is merit in placing gender incongruence in
an entirely separate ICD chapter that would contain no
other entities (Drescher et al., 2012).
Prevalence of studies in the literature
A PubMed search was carried out on 10 April 2015 in an
endeavour to undertake an examination of the extant
peer-reviewed medical literature (see Table 1). Some
items returned multiple false positive entries (i.e. trans
because it is a homonym) in which case only the first 100
entries were reviewed and articles were excluded as
necessary.
As peer reviewed literature on genderqueer and non-
binary identities is evidently extremely rare, that which
was found was snowballed to further include literature
which electronic engines have not adequately catalogued.
Further, the authors’ own very recent work was included,
as well as the legal and prevalence items mentioned
above. Lastly, some consideration was given to the grey
and community literatures as these are a rich source of
information on this emerging field, which will not be
listed on PubMed. Given the heterogeneity of this
literature, both in source and type, it has been included
in a bricolage above and below, rather than in a positivist
fashion.
A discussion of the literature
Non-binary people might appear to be a relatively recent
and under-researched phenomenon, but it is likely that
some people who previously would have identified as
trans(sexual) – that is within the gender binary, but
moving across it – may have identified outside of the
binary if that discourse had been available to them.
However, it is very likely that they were not distinguished
as such but were instead diagnosed as having a gender
identity disorder not otherwise specified by gender teams
at medical centres; and have only become increasingly
visible in recent years (Hage & Karim, 2000, Nieder &
Richter-Appelt, 2011). An analogy may be drawn with
the number of lesbian and gay people who became able
to
identify
their
sexualities
within
contemporary
Western societies when the possibility to do so became
more available and the identities became more widely
understood and accepted. This also applies, to a lesser
extent, to bisexual people, as bisexuality remains rela-
tively invisible (Barker et al., 2012). Further, some non-
binary and genderqueer people may have been reticent
to foreground their identities for fear that they would not
receive the physical testaments they desired. Hopefully,
compassionate clinical practice is now assisting this
group of people to feel comfortable presenting to get
their true needs met.
People who are now re-self-defining to a non-binary
identity are also increasingly availing themselves of the
possibilities afforded by the change in legal and bureau-
cratic systems – for example by using the title ‘Mx’ and
making a change of name to reflect their gender more
accurately (a non-gendered name, initials only, or
including both masculine and feminine names, for
example). Other strategies enabling genderqueer people
to express their non-binary identifications appropriately
in
a
day-to-day
context
include
the
following
(for detailed information see Nieder, 2014):
�
Stretching: Making the established identity categories
of
femininities
or
masculinities
more
flexible
(Connell, 2005),
�
Diversifying gender: Based on the concept of a
continuum whose graduations manifest themselves
via the interaction of sex characteristics, subjective
gender experiences, and expressions (Monro, 2007),
�
Dissolution or negation of sex difference: Pursued by
the genderqueer movement in particular (Bornstein
& Bergman, 2010; Nestle et al., 2002) with the goal
of a ‘non-gendered social order’ (Monro, 2010, p. 246),
�
Creating ambiguity: To express gender in a way that
defies a mono-sex assignment that is exclusive and
fixed over the life course (Engel, 2002).
It is therefore beholden on (mental) health care
providers to respect these different strategies and to
integrate them into their work.
When working with people who are existing psychi-
atric patients, professionals may understandably be
concerned that an ‘atypical’ gender is as a result of
some psychopathology such as psychosis or emotionally
unstable personality disorder. However, as with the
pathologization of homosexuality in the past, it is vital
not to pathologize a non-pathological identity, or to see

 it as pathology when it is ‘co-morbid’, in a way that we
would not with a binary gender (or heterosexuality).
Certainly there is no evidence to suggest that non-
binary genders are pathological. Indeed what evidence
there is suggests quite the reverse. It is worth considering
that there are no psychological fields in which male and
female are discrete (Fine, 2010) and that the overlap is
always greater than any difference (Maccoby & Jacklin,
1974). This is clearly adaptive as it enables both men and
women to carry out the variety of tasks required of them,
and consequently those people who are more ‘sex typed’
– that is further towards the ends of a notional gender
spectrum – are disabled by their rigid adherence to their
gender role (Bem & Lenney, 1976). Indeed, exposure to
gender role stereotypes diminishes confidence and
interest in ‘the other gender’s fields’ such as mathematics
for women (Correll, 2004), as well as actual performance
in them (McGlone & Aronson, 2006).
(Mental) health professionals, then, may best serve
their patients by supporting them in their identities and
expressions and affirmatively exploring identities if that
is the presenting problem. Empirical research in this area
would also be most welcome. In addition, psychiatrists,
psychologists and other clinicians may usefully utilize
their clinical skills as necessary to assist with psycho-
social transitions associated with non-binary genders.
This will include such things as addressing anxiety
around coming out to others and being seen in public,
consideration of intimate relationships and family,
sexuality and reproductive options, and consideration
of physical interventions aimed at the bodily and
psychological comfort of the non-binary person.
Those non-binary people who are seeking approval
for physical interventions should be compassionately
assisted, perhaps referring to standards of care such as
the World Professional Association for Transgender
Health’s (WPATH, 2011) Standards of care for the heath
of transsexual, transgender and gender nonconforming
people or the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ CR181, Good
practice guidelines for the assessment and treatment of
gender dysphoria (Wylie et al., 2014).
It is important to note here the differences and
similarities between trans people who make physical
gender changes within the binary, and non-binary people
who do not, as this is important in planning appropriate
support for individuals. A significant number of trans
people decide not to undergo surgical interventions to
address the incongruence between their physical and
mental gender (Bockting, 2008; WPATH, 2011). This
does not, in and of itself, define the individual as having
a non-binary gender identity, and the support and health
care needs of these individuals will differ from those with
a non-binary gender identity.
When considering physical interventions then, the
means for achieving overt masculinization or feminiza-
tion is quite established (Gooren, 2011) but in order to
guide genderqueer individuals in hormonal and/or
surgical treatments, and to predict their effect short
or long term, we have to creatively rely on principles of
treatment in trans men or women, or – in the case of
hormones – on data and treatment from related
endocrine conditions such as hypogonadism, precocious
puberty,
polycystic
ovarian
syndrome,
menopausal
replacement therapy, infertility, DSD, and on principles
of hormonal contraceptives.
Indeed, when relying on such information we much
also note that the physical intervention needs of non-
binary individuals are diverse. For example, as with trans
people within the gender binary, some do not desire any
such interventions. However, for a significant minority it
is most important to remove obvious markers of
masculinity or femininity (e.g. breasts or facial/body
hair). Others wish to combine such markers, or may be
taking a more conventional trans masculine or feminine
treatment path whilst maintaining a non-binary identity.
For example, Rankin & Beemyn (2012) found that some
non-binary people who were assigned female at birth
had chest surgery and/or took hormones. Others did not
engage in these methods, but modified some visible
markers of gender in other ways, including breast
binding, having a traditionally male hairstyle, not
shaving their body hair, bodybuilding, and/or packing
their groin region to give a stereotypically male contour.
Non-binary people who were assigned male at birth
similarly had varying relationships to hormones/sur-
geries. They frequently did things such as wearing make-
up, having long hair, removing body/facial hair, and/or
wearing ‘feminine’ jewellery. Some people liked to
destabilize conventional markers of gender by dressing
androgynously, by combining ‘men’s’ and ‘women’s’
clothing, and/or by dressing in clothing associated with a
different gender. Some made similar shifts in manner-
isms such as gait, making eye contact, and sitting with
legs together or apart.
It is clear that the endocrine possibilities or limitations
for this specific group are, so far, not described in the
medical literature and indeed it is likely that a proportion
of this group are self-medicating with the attendant risks
(Rotondi et al., 2013). Further, cosmetic interventions
may be sufficient to achieve partial feminization. Breast
implants can be considered safe, as is laser epilation,
even if the effect on skin is thought to be less successful
in the absence of hormonal treatment. The role of the
hormone-prescribing physician is therefore to liaise with
the multidisciplinary team as necessary and to moni-
tor the effects and mostly cardiovascular side effects of
INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY

 anti-androgens/oestrogens or testosterone treatment,
and to try to modify cardiac risk factors through
advising diet, exercise, and smoking cessation, and to
encourage routine surveillance of glycaemia, lipids,
haematocrit
and
bone
mineral
density.
A
second
important role is in counselling the individual about
what hormonal therapy is able to achieve, so that the
individual’s expectations of therapy can be aligned with
what is possible with current hormonal treatments, and
the impact of treatment on physical health discussed.
Given the lack of literature on this topic, referral to an
endocrinologist may be useful. For people assigned male
at birth, the endocrinologist can decide with the client on
anti-androgen or oestrogen monotherapy, with variable
dosage or intermittent use. Unfortunately, no data on
small
dosage
anti-androgen
therapy
is
available.
Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists or antagonists
may be less desired for this group since absolute
testosterone suppression would be achieved; however,
used in combination with androgen and oestrogen they
could offer the possibility of tailoring the hormonal
milieu of the individual without surgical interventions
such as gonadectomy. Lower dosage oral anti-androgen
treatment (finasteride, cyproterone acetate or spirono-
lactone) can create moderate androgen deprivation,
possibly leading to interruption of the process of
androgenetic alopecia, somewhat less virilization, and
the development of the desired mild gynaecomastia.
Erectile dysfunction that may occur can be treated with
PDE-V inhibitors on demand. All hormonal interven-
tions should, of course, be preceded by a discussion on
the effect on fertility (Richards & Seal, 2014; T’Sjoen
et al., 2013) although it is worth noting that interruption
of hormonal treatment is likely to restore spermatogen-
esis over a period of 6 months. The occurrence of
metabolic side effects of high-dose anti-androgen ther-
apy, such as used in prostate cancer or sex offenders, can
be considered modest. If feminizing hormone therapy is
used long term, without the desire for genital surgery,
probably no specific oncological concerns are needed for
the testicular tissue, and breast cancer is rarely reported
(Gooren et al., 2013). Indeed, prostate cancer is rarely
reported in trans women, but it does occur and
continuous monitoring has to be considered in all
those undergoing anti-androgen therapy (Gooren &
Morgentaler, 2014).
For people assigned female at birth, partial virilization
can be achieved through different therapies, depending
on the wish of the client. Interruption of menstrual
bleeding can be achieved by use of continuous progestins
or intrauterine devices. Prolonged intake of combined
oral contraceptive pills will lead to amenorrhoea, but
clients have to be warned about the possibly of spotting
or irregular and unpredictable menses as there will be a
30% increased oestrogen intake. Use of dihydrotestos-
terone is often desired, but remains barely described; as
is low dose or intermitted treatment with testosterone. It
has to be considered that exogenous testosterone is
aromatized to oestrogen, and if no surgical steps are
taken, monitoring for breast, cervix, endometrium or
ovarian cancer remain necessary. Hormone-dependent
cancers have been rarely reported in trans men and so
may also be the case here. Fertility seems preserved, as
has been shown in popular literature, and virilization
does not disappear if testosterone is temporarily inter-
rupted for this cause, but specific guidance remains
undescribed.
Conclusion
Recent reports indicate that the overall number of
individuals with gender dysphoria who attend clinical
services for an assessment has increased substantially
over the years in many North American and European
countries (Aitken et al, 2015; De Vries et al, 2015). There
is also a significant increase in people who self-diagnose
as suffering from gender dysphoria and gender incon-
gruence (Kuyper & Wijsen, 2014; Van Caenegem et al.,
2015).
Although the proportion of people who identify as
non-binary and seek gender-related treatment within the
aforementioned research remains unknown, it is highly
likely that an increasing amount of non-binary people
will present to clinical services seeking treatment. In the
absence of clinical guidelines and treatment protocols for
this group, prospective outcome studies are vital and
timely. In the mean time we urge careful compassionate
assistance for this patient group.
