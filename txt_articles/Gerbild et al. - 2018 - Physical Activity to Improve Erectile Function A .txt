ABSTRACT
Introduction: The leading cause of erectile dysfunction (ED) is arterial dysfunction, with cardiovascular disease
as the most common comorbidity. Therefore, ED is typically linked to a web of closely interrelated cardiovascular
risk factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Physical activity (PA) has
proved to be a protective factor against erectile problems, and it has been shown to improve erectile function for
men affected by vascular ED. This systematic review estimated the levels of PA needed to decrease ED for men
with physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or manifest cardiovascular diseases.
Aim: To provide recommendations of levels of PA needed to decrease ED for men with physical inactivity,
obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or cardiovascular diseases.
Methods: In accord with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines, a systematic review was performed of research articles specifically investigating PA as a possible
treatment of ED. The review included research on ED from physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, metabolic
syndrome, and/or cardiovascular diseases. All available studies from 2006 through 2016 were checked for the
predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to analyze the levels of PA needed to decrease ED.
Results: 10 articles met the inclusion criteria, all suggesting various levels of PA needed to decrease ED for men
with relevant risk factors for ED. The results of the review provided sufficient research evidence for conclusions
regarding the levels of PA necessary to decrease ED.
Conclusion: Recommendations of PA to decrease ED should include supervised training consisting of 40 minutes
of aerobic exercise of moderate to vigorous intensity 4 times per week. Overall, weekly exercise of 160 minutes for
6 months contributes to decreasing erectile problems in men with ED caused by physical inactivity, obesity, hy-
pertension, metabolic syndrome, and/or cardiovascular diseases. Gerbild H, Larsen CM, Graugaard C, Areskoug

INTRODUCTION
Sexuality is an important part of physical and mental
health.1 Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most common sexual
dysfunction in men,2e7 and it is defined as the inability to
attain or maintain a penile erection of sufficient quality to
permit satisfactory sexual activity.3,5,7e12 Whether aging, het-
erosexual couples continue to be sexually active seems, to a
large extent, determined by the sexual function of the male
partner.13 ED has a negative impact on quality of life and
well-being, and it is further associated with anxiety and
depression.7,14 In consequence, ED is increasingly recognized
as a public health challenge,15 although it is frequently
neglected in clinical practice.12

 ED affects 1/3 of all men, and the prevalence of ED increases
with age.2,5,6,16,17 Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that
physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension (HTN), metabolic
syndrome (MetS), atherosclerosis, and manifest cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs) are risk factors for ED,2,4,6,7,14,15,17e22 because
the prevalence of ED is increased in these general population
groups.4,17,23e26 Furthermore, the prevalence of ED increases
with the number of risk factors present.5
Penile
erection
is
a
hemodynamic
process
involving
increased arterial inflow and restricted venous outflow3,6;
therefore, ED can be an early warning sign of poor vascular
function. Thus, ED has been coined “penile angina”24 because
it can be predictive of future CVD12 and because CV risk
factors and CVD frequently lead to ED.3,4,6,18,27e29 Endo-
thelial inflammation, which disrupts nitric oxide (NO) pro-
duction, is a central determinant of vascular diseases including
ED.4e6,29 Neuronal and endothelial NO mediates the vascular
component of sexual arousal by causing engorgement of the
corpora cavernosa tissue and subsequent erection of the penis.
It is well recognized that erectile blood flow is regulated by
constriction or relaxation of the smooth muscle cells of penile
arterial vessels.3,19,21,28
To diagnose and quantify the severity of ED, the International
Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)9 and the abridged 5-item
version (IIEF-5)10 are the most commonly used patient-
reported outcome measures.12 The main therapeutic strategy in
clinical health care is to compensate for ED by using phospho-
diesterase type 5 inhibitor medications. However, phosphodies-
terase type 5 inhibitors only temporarily restore erectile function,
and they have been found to be ineffective in a significant
proportion of men with ED.21 Moreover, phosphodiesterase type
5 inhibitors do not appear to have any long-term impact on the
underlying vascular dysfunction,21 and they do not have any
curative effect on endothelial or arterial dysfunctions or erectile
problems.3,11,21,29e31 Additional medical treatment possibilities
are scarce, although the role of non-pharmacologic lifestyle
interventions in lessening the burden of ED has increasingly
been recognized.3,12,14,32,33
Physical activity (PA) can potentially decrease ED,7,21 and PA
has been identified as the lifestyle factor most strongly correlated
with erectile function and the most important promoter of
vascular health.19,28 Thus, moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA
is associated with normal erectile function and lower risk of
ED.6,18e20,25,27,29,34,35 The protective effect of PA also applies
to men with obesity, HTN, and MetS.19,36e38 PA causes
improved endothelial function and NO production,6,24,28,29,39
and PA has consistently been shown to advance erectile
function.5,19,21,29,39
Hence, there is strong evidence that frequent PA significantly
improves
erectile
function.3,11,12,31
Previous
reviews
have
assessed the association between PA and ED,3,5,12,14,33 but the
quality and quantity of PA needed (ie, modalities, duration, in-
tensity,
and
frequency39)
are
insufficiently
described,12,14
although knowledge of these is essential for clinical guidance of
patients with ED.4,12,19,28,40
To provide recommendations for PA-induced improvement of
erectile function in men characterized by physical inactivity,
obesity, HTN, MetS, and/or manifest CVD, we need in-depth
knowledge of the specific modality, duration, intensity, and
frequency of PA required to treat ED successfully. A systematic
review of clinical intervention studies could provide this
knowledge or indicate the need for future research in this field.
AIM
The aim of the study was to provide recommendations of
levels of PA needed to decrease ED for men with physical
inactivity, obesity, HTN, MetS, and/or manifest CVDs.
METHODS
Search Strategy
A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines based on PICO (patient, intervention,
comparison, and outcome41) and the “Building Block Search
Strategy.”42 The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases
were systematically searched to identify studies eligible for the
review. The following search terms were used: physical activity,
physical
endurance,
physical
conditioning,
exercise,
exercises,
training, aerobic, fitness, and resistance training in combination
with erectile dysfunction, erection dysfunction, and impotence.
An initial screening of titles and abstracts was performed with
Covidence43 to identify potentially relevant studies, after which
the full texts of the identified studies were examined. Reference
lists of eligible articles were manually checked for additional
relevant studies. The search strategy is provided in Appendix B.
Only full-text studies written in English were included. The
search was performed on January 25, 2017. The PRISMA
checklist is provided in Appendix A.
Inclusion Criteria
The studies included in the review meet the following inclu-
sion criteria:
1. Study
design:
randomized
controlled
trials
(RCTs)
or
controlled trails (CTs)
2. Study population: men at least 18 years old with arterial ED
and men characterized by physical inactivity, obesity, HTN,
MetS, and/or manifest CVD
3. Study intervention: any exercise protocol involving PA to
decrease ED
4. Baseline and follow-up measurements: ED measured using
the IIEF score (maximum ¼ 30 points) or IIEF-5 score
(maximum ¼ 25 points)9,10,44 and exercises measured by
modality, duration, intensity, and frequency
Sex Med 2018;6:75e89
76
Gerbild et al
 5. Publication: studies should be included in full-text articles and
originally published in peer-reviewed journals from 2006
through 2016
Exclusion Criteria
Exclusion criteria were studies including population groups
with ED caused by neurologic disorders, hormone disorders,
psychiatric disorders, cancers, diabetes mellitus, HIV, liver or
kidney diseases, major surgery, radiotherapy, or side effects of
medications.
Data Collection and Analysis
2 researchers independently reviewed the full texts of all
potentially relevant articles for eligibility and to ensure compli-
ance with the inclusion criteria. Eventual disagreements were
resolved through discussion to reach consensus.
Studies included in the analyses were registered with the name
of the first author, year of publication, population group (physical
inactivity, obesity, HTN, MetS, or CVD), country of origin, study
design, age, sample size, numbers of participants in the interven-
tion group, and numbers of participants in the control group.
In accord with the PRISMA guidelines, 2 researchers inde-
pendently evaluated the risk of bias in the selected studies using
the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (ROBAT)45 in Covidence.43
Factors considered in the evaluation of bias included sequence
generation (selection bias), allocation sequence concealment
(selection bias), blinding (performance and detection bias),
incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), and selective outcome
reporting (reporting bias). The ROBAT was applied to RCTs
and CTs with extra attention to selection bias for CTs as rec-
ommended by Higgins et al.45 Any disagreements were discussed
until an agreement was reached.
Studies reporting the IIEF or IIEF-5 score in the intervention
and control groups at baseline and in follow-up were extracted as
follows: (i) in relation to mean IIEF or IIEF-5 score at follow-up
for the intervention and control groups; (ii) the score in relation
to ED9,10: “no ED,” “mild ED,” “mild to moderate ED,”
“moderate ED,” or “severe ED”; and (iii) the improvement of
erectile function analyzed by calculating the relative change. In
illustrations of improvements of erectile function and of IIEF
score at baseline and follow-up, all IIEF-5 measurements were
scaled to the IIEF range (�30/25) to compare the studies.
Data related to the intervention level and amount of the PA
intervention were extracted for the following levels: (i) modality:
aerobic, resistance training; (ii) intensity: mild, moderate, or
vigorous; (iii) duration: length of each session; (iv) frequency:
number of sessions per week; (v) weekly dose in minutes or
hours; (vi) the period of the program in weeks, months, or years
(follow-up duration); and (vii) delivery and location factors: su-
pervised or unsupervised intervention and additional goals. In
addition, dimensions of PA were explored in relation to the
included risk groups.
RESULTS
Initially, 1,950 records relevant to the research terms were
found in the selected databases (Figure 1). Of these, 332 du-
plicates were removed, leaving 1,618 publications. After the 1st
screening, 1,566 records were excluded because they did not
meet the inclusion criteria. 52 potentially eligible studies were
identified. After examining the full texts of these articles, 42
studies were excluded because the requested data were not re-
ported, leading to the inclusion of 10 studies.46e55
Studies Included in Analysis
The eligible studies included 7 RCTs and 3 CTs. Studies were
divided into 5 study groups: physical inactivity, obesity, HTN,
MetS, and/or manifest CVD. For each study group, 1 to 4
studies were found (Table 1). Participants’ ages ranged from
41 to 62 years (mean ¼ 55 years). The studies were mostly
performed in Europe.
Risk of Bias in Individual Studies
In general, the risk of bias for each study was estimated to be
moderate (Table 2). The studies by Maio et al47 and Khoo et al48
had the lowest risk of bias. Nearly half (40%) the studies had a
risk of selection bias, and blinding of investigators was unclear in
most studies (90%). However, the most common risk of bias was
lack of blinding of participants and staff (Figure 2).
Improvements in Erectile Function by PA
Erectile function was measured in 6 studies using the IIEF-5
and in 4 studies using the IIEF (Table 3).
In 4 of the 6 studies using the IIEF-5, mean erectile function
was reported at baseline and follow-up for men in the inter-
vention and control groups, respectively. In these 4 studies, the
mean IIEF-5 score ranged from 11.0 to 18.1 at baseline for men
in the intervention group and from 10.5 to 18.3 for men in the
control group. At follow-up, the mean IIEF-5 score ranged from
14.4 to 20.7 for men in the intervention group and from 11.0 to
20.1 for men in the control group. 1 study did not report the
IIEF-5 score for the control group but reported that the outcome
IIEF-5 score did not differ from the baseline IIEF-5 score.53
Another study did not report the mean IIEF-5 score at follow-
up for the intervention or control group.55 However, the study
reported that, at baseline, 34% and 36% of men in the inter-
vention and control groups, respectively, had normal erectile
function and that, at follow-up, 56% and 38% of men in the
intervention and control groups, respectively, had normal erectile
function.
In 3 of the 4 studies using the IIEF, mean erectile function
score was reported at baseline and follow-up for the intervention
and control groups (Table 3). At baseline, mean IIEF score
ranged from 10.8 to 15.8 for men in the intervention group and
from 8.1 to 15.5 for men in the control group. At follow-up,
mean IIEF score ranged from 15.1 to 26.8 for men in the
Sex Med 2018;6:75e89

77
 intervention group and from 8.9 to 24.7 for men in the control
group. Begot et al54 did not report the mean IIEF score at
baseline or follow-up for the intervention or control group.
However, they reported that, at baseline, 84% and 83% of men
in the intervention and control groups, respectively, had ED. At
follow-up, 12% and 93% of men in the intervention and control
groups, respectively, had ED.
The ED score was “mild” at baseline for the intervention and
control groups in 5 studies (Table 3). In contrast to the control
groups, the intervention groups in the 3 studies by Kalka
et al51e53 achieved an improvement of erectile function, which
remained in the category “mild.” In Maio et al47 and Khoo
et al,48 the control groups also achieved an improvement in
erectile function, but the improvement of the control groups was
not as high as in the intervention groups.
In 3 studies, ED at baseline was “moderate” for the inter-
vention and control groups (Table 3). Only in 1 study did the
control group achieve an improvement in erectile function,

Gerbild et al
 which was “mild to moderate” ED at follow-up. At follow-up,
the intervention group in all 3 studies achieved an improve-
ment in erectile function. In the study by La Vignera et al,46
ED at follow-up was “mild to moderate,” and in the studies by
Lamina et al49 and Maresca et al,50 ED was “mild.”
In all studies, the intervention group achieved an improve-
ment in erectile function (Figure 3). According to the relative
improvement of erectile function, the intervention groups ach-
ieved an improvement of 14% to 86%. In all studies, the
intervention group achieved an improvement in erectile function
(Figure 3), where all IIEF-5 measurements had been scaled to the
IIEF range (�30/25).
According to the relative improvement in erectile function,
the intervention groups achieved an improvement of 14% to
86% (Figure 4).
The intervention group in the studies by Maresca et al50 and
Maio et al47 achieved an improvement in erectile function of
86% and 70%, respectively. For the control group, the change
varied from a worsening of 5% to an improvement of 59%
relative to the applied IIEF and IIEF-5 scores (Table 3, Figure 4).
Dimensions of PA in Relation to Included Risk
Groups
Levels of PA in relation to the included risk groups (physical
inactivity, obesity, HTN, MetS, and/or manifest CVD) are
presented in Tables 3 and 4. In the 2 studies of physically
inactive men without diagnoses other than ED,46,47 the men
received supervision in improving PA and exercised aerobically
with moderate intensity for 150 and 180 minutes per week,
respectively, over a period of 3 months. Men in the intervention

 groups achieved a relative improvement in erectile function of
70% and 50%, respectively.
In the 2 studies of sedentary obese men with ED, the PA was
supervised and moderate, and the men exercised for 24 and 6
months, respectively. In the study by Esposito et al,55 the
amount of training for the intervention group was at least 150
minutes per week; in the study by Khoo et al,48 the intervention
and control groups trained for at least 90 to 150 and 200 to 300
minutes per week, respectively. In these 2 studies, weight loss
was an additional goal. Because Esposito et al did not report the
IIEF-5 score in the intervention and control groups at follow-
up, the relative erectile improvement cannot be analyzed. In
the study by Khoo et al, the intervention and control groups
achieved relative improvements of erectile function of 14% and
10%, respectively.
The study by Lamina et al49 was the only study of sedentary
and hypertensive men with ED. The intervention group was
involved in supervised, interval-based exercise of moderate to
vigorous intensity. Over 8 weeks, the intervention group trained
for 135 to 180 minutes per week, and a relative improvement in
erectile function of 32% was achieved.
Men affected by ED and MetS participated in the study by
Maresca et al.50 The intervention group underwent a 2-month
training program under the supervision of a cardiologist and a
physiotherapist. The training program consisted of PA of mod-
erate intensity for 120 minutes per week, and the intervention
group achieved a relative improvement in erectile function of 86%.
The study by Begot et al54 and the 3 studies by Kalka
et al51e53 represented studies of men with CVD and ED. In the
study by Begot et al, the target group was treated for acute
myocardial infarction, and in the studies by Kalka et al, the target
groups were invasively treated for ischemic heart disease. In all 4
studies, the PA was aerobic. In the studies by Kalka et al, the
intensity was moderate to vigorous, and only Begot et al reported
an intensity of mild to moderate. In the study by Begot et al, the
intervention group received supervision in improving PA and
participants were physically active for 120 to 200 minutes per
week over a period of 1 month. Because Begot et al did not
report the IIEF-5 score in the intervention and control groups at
follow-up, the relative erectile improvement cannot be deter-
mined. In the studies conducted by Kalka et al, the training
intervention groups performed aerobic PA for 135 minutes per
week over a period of 6 months. In addition, a resistance training
program was performed twice a week. In all 3 studies, the
intervention group achieved a relative improvement in erectile
function of 15%.
Levels of PA for All Included Studies
Levels of the PA intervention programs in the included studies
of men with physical inactivity, obesity, HTN, MetS, and/or
manifest CVD in relation to IIEF score are presented in Table 3,
and details of the levels of the PA programs are presented in
Table 4. Levels of PA are described in more detail because of the
variability of PA in the included studies.
Modalities of PA
In all 10 studies, the PA training modality for the intervention
group was aerobic.
Intensity of PA
The intensity of the aerobic PA training program was mod-
erate in all studies. In 5 of the studies, the moderate intensity was
supplemented by intervals of vigorous intensity. Only 1 study
had PA intensity of mild to moderate.52 In 4 studies,51e53,55 the
moderate aerobic PA exercises were supplemented with resistance
training programs.
Duration of Sessions of PA
In 9 of the studies, the duration of each PA session varied from
30 to 60 minutes. In 4 of these studies, the minimum duration
was at least 40 minutes, which also was the mean duration of
sessions for all 10 studies. Only 1 study accepted a minimum
duration of 20 minutes for each PA session.47

 Frequency of PA
The weekly frequency of the PA sessions varied from 3 to 7
(mean frequency ¼ 4). In 5 studies, the standard frequency was 3
weekly PA sessions. Only 1 study had a PA frequency of up to 7
sessions per week.48
Weekly Dose of PA
Doses of PA varied from 120 to 300 minutes per week (mean
weekly dose ¼ 157 minutes, or w2 hours 30 minutes).
Training Period of PA
The PA programs varied from 1 to 24 months (mean training
period ¼ w6 months). Thus, the study by Maio et al47 had the
longest follow-up duration of 2 years, and the study by Begot
et al54 had the shortest follow-up duration of 1 month.
Delivery of PA and Additional Interventions and
Goals of the Included Studies
In almost all programs, individual supervision of participants
was included. In addition, the programs involving obesity
focused on dietary counseling, aiming at lower energy intake and
decreased body weight (Tables 3 and 4).
The control groups varied between not increasing their PA
level and having a high level of PA.
DISCUSSION
Several reviews have demonstrated that PA protects against
arterial ED.7,18,19,28 Previous research regarding the decrease of
ED has focused mainly on the statistically significant effects of
PA3,12 and the underlying physiologic mechanisms,5 concluding
that PA is an effective, non-invasive, and non-pharmacologic
intervention against ED in men. However, the levels of PA
needed to treat ED remain uncertain.
The aim of this review was to enhance the understanding of
the levels of PA (ie, modality, intensity, duration of sessions,
frequency, weekly dose, and training period) needed to improve
erectile function for men with physical inactivity, obesity, HTN,
MetS, and/or manifest CVD. Among the included studies, there
was a wide variation of the dose of PA and training periods,

 ranging from 1 month to 2 years. This variability could have
affected the results in this review.
Our results indicate that continuous and interval-based aero-
bic training improve erectile function for men with arterial ED.
PA with moderate intensity and intervals of vigorous intensity
seems to be one of the key elements in determining the efficiency
of the applied physical exercise, which is in concordance with
findings in the systematic review and meta-analysis of Silva et al12
and Lamina et al.3 Our review also showed that resistance
training can complement aerobic exercises.
Regarding the weekly dose of aerobic PA required to treat ED
successfully, our study indicated a volume of 4 sessions of
moderate- to high-intensity training lasting 40 minutes per ses-
sion, corresponding to a weekly dose of 160 minutes. This result
is in line with the review by Hehemann and Kashanian,14 which
recommended the same dose based on guidelines for decreasing
HTN. However, Khoo et al48 indicated that weekly exercise of
200 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity training results in a
much greater improvement of IIEF score in obese men than 90
to 150 minutes of weekly training. However, because the study
group included obese men, the findings might not be applicable
to normal-weight men with arterial ED. According to the World
Health Organization (WHO),56 healthy adults should exercise
for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic PA or 75
minutes of vigorous-intensity PA per week. This constitutes
slightly lower levels of PA than needed to decrease ED according
to the results of this review. The recommendations by the WHO
to gain additional health effects are to increase the intensity and
number of weekly minutes. Thus, by following the general advice
regarding PA, ED should be decreased.
Other important non-pharmacologic interventions such as
diet, weight loss, pelvic floor muscle training, and smoking
cessation also improve erectile function for men with arterial
ED.6,20,22,29,32 Further research is needed regarding combined
lifestyle interventions including PA.
The results of this review point to a need for further research
regarding the effect of PA on arterial ED for men with physical
inactivity, obesity, HTN, MetS, and/or manifest CVDs and
research regarding the effect of PA with longer periods of follow-
up, resistance training in addition to aerobic training, and the
effects of the WHO recommendations on ED. Further, a review of
improvements of specific physiologic markers of physical fitness
correlated to the decrease of ED is warranted, because this could
increase our understanding of the positive effect of PA on ED.
Recommendations and Clinical Implications
This review suggests that PA is an effective intervention to
treat arterial ED. PA is rarely used in clinical practice to improve
erectile function,12 which represents a paradox and is far from
optimal considering the effect of PA on arterial ED. The results
of this review support supervised, aerobic PA with moderate to
vigorous intensity as a rational recommendation for men with
ED, indicating a potential key role for physiotherapists in the
treatment of arterial ED. Physiotherapists are specialized in
guiding and supervising PA as a tool of health promotion, aiming
to improve the patient’s level of PA within the scope of the in-
dividual patient’s preferences and possibilities.57 To treat men
with ED optimally, physiotherapists need basic qualifications
regarding sexual dysfunctions, sexual health, and sexual rehabil-
itation58 and knowledge and competence in using PA as an
intervention to treat ED. Therefore, this review emphasizes the
need for evidence-based guidelines for clinical practice that
support PA-centered improvement of erectile function. By better
understanding the complex web of factors influencing erectile
function and overall vascular health, physiotherapists and other
health care providers can help their patients prevent vascular
diseases and thereby improve their sexual health. This offers an
immediate motivation for men to change their lifestyle habits to
improve their CV health.
This review indicates that 40 minutes of supervised, aerobic
PA of moderate intensity 4 times weekly for 6 months improves
erectile function for men with arterial ED caused by physical
inactivity, obesity, HTN, MetS, and/or manifest CVD. PA at
moderate intensity can be successfully supplemented with PA at
intervals of vigorous intensity. The aerobic modality can be
further combined with resistance training. Because of the small
number of studies and their intervention variability, additional
research to strengthen the evidence is essential.
Methodologic Aspects of the Articles Reviewed
The number of participants in the included studies was rela-
tively small, with the smallest including only 10 participants.
Analysis of the risk of bias showed a high risk of performance
bias, which was expected because blinding of participants and
personnel, for obvious reasons, is not possible in a supervised
exercise intervention. All 3 CTs had high risk of selection bias,
which negatively affects the external validity of the studies. This
was expected because CTs are non-randomized. However, if the
3 CTs had been excluded from this review, the smaller number
of studies would have led to a decreased insight into the variation
of PA needed to treat ED.
Methodologic Aspects of Our Review
The strength of this review is the systematic literature search
aimed at including all published RCTs and CTs regarding PA
targeting ED. An additional strength is its strict adherence to the
PRISMA guidelines. Moreover, all included trials used compa-
rable measurements to evaluate changes of patient-reported
erectile function (IIEF or IIEF-5). Further, the interventions in
all studies were aerobic PA of moderate intensity.
A limitation of the review is that the effect of various PA levels
is not directly comparable across the included studies because of
variation in population groups, inclusion and exclusion criteria,
and types of intervention. The limited number of eligible studies
Sex Med 2018;6:75e89
86
Gerbild et al
 is an obvious limitation, and a larger number of studies would
have added strength to the results.
CONCLUSION
Recommendations considering PA to decrease arterial ED
should include supervised training consisting of aerobic exercise
of moderate to vigorous intensity 4 times per week for 40
minutes. An overall weekly exercise dose of 160 minutes for 6
months contributes to a decrease of ED for men with arterial
ED due to physical inactivity, obesity, HTN, MetS, and/or
manifest CVD.
