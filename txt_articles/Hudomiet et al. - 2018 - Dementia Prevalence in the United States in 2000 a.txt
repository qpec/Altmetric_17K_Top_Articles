Abstract
Objectives: Age- and sex-specific rates of dementia are estimated in the U.S. population aged 65 or older in 2000 and 2012 
using a large nationally representative dataset, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and accounting for mortality selec-
tion and specificities of the interview protocol.
Method: A latent cognitive ability model is estimated by maximum simulated likelihood. Prevalence of dementia is iden-
tified using HRS cognition measures and the Aging, Demographics and Memory Study (ADAMS), a subset of the HRS 
(n = 856) with clinical assessment for dementia. Different cognitive measures are collected in self and proxy interviews. 
From 2006 onward, the HRS collected fewer interviews by proxy. Selection into proxy interviews is modeled as well as 
survival into the ADAMS sample from the previous HRS interview.
Results: The prevalence of dementia decreased from 12.0% (SE = 0.48%) in 2000 to 10.5% (SE = 0.49%) in 2012 in the 
65+ population, a statistically significant decline of 12.6% (p < .01). The percentage change in prevalence was larger among 
males (16.6% vs 9.5%), and younger individuals.
Discussion: The prevalence of dementia among those 65 or older decreased between 2000 and 2012, although less rapidly 
than reported in other studies. The difference is primarily due to our modeling selection into proxy interviews.

Dementia has a large impact on older adults, their families, 
and government programs in the United States and many 
other countries. In 2010, about 4.2 million U.S. adults 
and more than 36 million around the world had demen-
tia (Hurd, Martorell, Delavande, Mullen, & Langa, 2013; 
Prince et al., 2013). Its economic impact, including a large 
burden of unpaid caregiving provided mostly by fam-
ily members, is estimated at $200 billion per year in the 
United States (Hurd et al., 2013) and $600 billion world-
wide (Wimo, Jonsson, Bond, Prince, & Winblad, 2013).
Assuming no change in age-specific rates of dementia, 
we can expect prevalence to increase substantially due 
to population aging—and possibly triple by 2050, when 
it will affect 130 million worldwide (Prince et al., 2015). 
However, there is some evidence in the United States and 
Europe that age-adjusted prevalence of dementia may 
be decreasing, possibly due to increasing levels of educa-
tion and better treatment of key cardiovascular risk fac-
tors (Langa et al., 2017; Larson, Yaffe, & Langa, 2013; 
Matthews et al., 2013; Rocca et al., 2011; Satizabal et al., 
2016; Schrijvers et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2016). Any change 
in the trend in age-specific prevalence rates would have a 
major impact on projected overall prevalence in the popu-
lation, and consequently, on associated costs, need for care, 
and other related outcomes.
In the United States, most evidence on trends in the 
prevalence of dementia comes from community-based 
cohort studies such as the Framingham Heart Study or

 the Chicago Health and Aging Project. Rocca and col-
leagues (2011) reported small and typically not significant 
decreases in dementia using several such studies. Satizabal 
and colleagues (2016), however, found a 44% decrease in 
the 5-year cumulative hazard of dementia incidence from 
the late 1970s to the late 2000s. These community-based 
studies typically have very high quality measures of health 
outcomes, but their comparatively small sample sizes and 
geographically limited samples, may not generalize to the 
entire U.S. population.
An alternative approach to measuring trends in the 
prevalence of dementia is to use survey data, such as the 
Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS has inter-
viewed about 20,000 individuals per wave since 1992. It 
is nationally representative, and has a wide range of infor-
mation about individuals’ health and socioeconomic status. 
Moreover, 856 sample members were administered a clinical 
assessment for dementia within the Aging, Demographics 
and Memory Study (ADAMS). Plassman and colleagues 
(2007) and Hurd and colleagues (2013) provided the first 
nationally representative estimates of dementia prevalence 
and of the costs of dementia in the United States, respect-
ively. Based on HRS data, Langa and colleagues (2017) 
reported that the prevalence of dementia in the 65+ year 
old population decreased by about one-fourth from 2000 
to 2012, or from 11.6% to 8.8% in 2012.
In this article, we use a latent variable statistical model to 
estimate on HRS data the prevalence of dementia in 2000 
and 2012. The starting point of our model is that cognitive 
status is not directly observed in the HRS; rather, noisy indi-
cators of cognition are observed. The most important indi-
cators are the HRS cognitive tests (such as word recall), but 
they only imprecisely establish cognitive status. Additional, 
observable data such as health indicators, activity limita-
tions, and personal characteristics including education and 
age provide additional information about cognitive status. 
The model permits us to address some issues that earlier 
studies did not address. In particular, we focus on three 
issues:
1. The ADAMS interviews followed HRS interviews with 
a delay of about 1 year, on average, and 12.9% of the 
ADAMS target sample died before they were contacted 
and interviewed. If the timing of the ADAMS interviews 
and mortality are correlated with dementia status, the 
prevalence estimates of dementia in ADAMS may be 
biased (Heeringa et al., 2009).
2. The fraction of interviews by proxy respondents 
decreased significantly from 2000 to 2012, likely due 
to changes in the HRS field procedures (Langa et al., 
2017). Respondents with low cognitive ability are much 
more likely to be interviewed by proxy; hence proxy sta-
tus is a marker of low cognition. It is therefore plausible 
that some of the measured decrease in dementia from 
2000 to 2012 was spurious and due to the falling frac-
tion of proxy interviews. Such changes in interviewing 
protocols need to be modeled if they are found to be 
quantitatively important.
3. ADAMS only included individuals who were 70+ years 
old at the latest HRS interviews. To measure dementia 
in the broader 65+ age range in the HRS, a conditional 
independence assumption is needed: age does not pre-
dict dementia status above and beyond the other vari-
ables used in the model, such as the cognitive scores. 
We found, however, that age is a strong predictor of de-
mentia status in ADAMS even when a very detailed set of 
HRS cognitive measures are controlled (Supplementary 
Tables D1 and D2.)
To estimate the prevalence of dementia, while accounting 
for these three issues, we model mortality, interview tim-
ing and selection into proxy interviews, and we include a 
large set of covariates in the estimation, including age itself, 
so that the conditional independence assumption is more 
likely satisfied (point 3 above).
Methods
Data
The HRS is a nationally representative, biennial, longitu-
dinal survey of persons aged 51 or older. It is sponsored 
by the National Institute on Aging (grant number NIA 
U01AG009740) and is conducted by the University of 
Michigan. Refreshment cohorts of age 51–56 enter the 
survey every 6 years. The sample size is about 20,000 per 
wave, with about 10,000 aged 65+. In most cases, HRS 
directly interviews the sampled individual (self-interviews), 
but when the individual is unable to participate (in 5–10% 
of the cases) the interview is conducted with proxy inform-
ants such as spouses, other family members, or friends. 
Individuals with cognitive limitations are much more likely 
to be interviewed by proxy. The first interviews are always 
face-to-face, and subsequent ones are either face-to-face or 
telephone interviews, depending on many factors.
The HRS is unusually detailed in health and cognition 
outcomes. To predict dementia status, we used data on a 
number of risk factors for dementia and on correlates of 
cognitive difficulties:
 
• Subjectively rated health, which was reported on a 5-point 
scale: 1 (excellent), 2 (very good), 3 (good), 4 (fair), or 5 
(poor). We collapsed these into a 3-point scale by merging 
categories 1 and 2 as well as categories 4 and 5.
 
• Number of limitations (from 0 to 5) in instrumental 
activities of daily living (IADL), such as using the phone 
or dealing with money (see RAND-HRS, 2016, for tech-
nical details).
 
• Ever having been diagnosed with (a) hypertension, (b) 
diabetes, (c) stroke, and (d) psychiatric problems. The first 
three are known dementia risk factors. The fourth may 
also correlate with dementia status if, for example, indi-
viduals consider cognitive decline a psychiatric problem.

 We used an extensive set of cognition measures in the 
analysis. Both self- and proxy interviews have a 5-point 
memory scale, varying from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Other 
cognition variables differ by interview type.
For self-interviews, we use a range of cognitive measures 
adapted from the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status 
(TICS): a 10-word test for immediate recall, a 10-word test 
for delayed recall, a serial-7 subtraction test (subtracting 
7 five times starting from 100), backward counting (from 
20 to 10), question on today's date, and day of the week, 
the name of the president, and being able to name “cactus” 
and “scissor” after paraphrasing. To simplify the analysis, 
we collapsed all this information into a composite score 
based on the sum of the TICS items, subjectively rated 
memory (reverse coded so that high values mean better 
memory), and instrumental activity limitations (also re-
verse coded). The composite score took values from 0 to 
43. The Supplementary Appendix shows how cognitive 
status in ADAMS is related to the individual HRS items 
included in the score.
For proxy interviews we used four cognition measures. 
Jorm IQCODE is a 16-item battery about recent improve-
ments/declines in various aspects of memory. All 16 
items were first coded into a 1–5 score [1 (memory much 
improved), 2 (a bit improved), 3 (not much changed), 4 
(a bit worse), 5 (much worse)]. We then took the person-
specific mean and created a 0–2 score. Those whose mean 
score was between 1 and 3 (no change or improvement on 
average) received a value of 0, those whose mean score was 
between 3 and 4 (some decline on average) were coded as 1, 
and those whose mean score was above 4 received a value 
of 2. Similarly, interviewers assessed whether cognitive lim-
itations were a reason for conducting a proxy interview, 
which we coded on a scale of 0 (no difficulty), 1 (some dif-
ficulty), or 2 (could not do interview). The proxies are also 
asked if the person “ever wanders off,” and whether he or 
she can be left alone, which were both coded on a 0–1 scale. 
Again, we created a composite score by taking the sum of 
all the four measures and adding subjectively rated memory 
and instrumental activity limitations. This composite score 
takes values from 0 to 15; it is negatively related to cog-
nition; and the Supplementary Appendix shows how the 
items of the score predict cognitive status in ADAMS.
The analytic sample is restricted to those aged 65 and 
older in the 2000 and 2012 HRS, because many cognitive 
ability measures are only available in this age range.
We used several demographic variables as predictors of 
dementia status: education (coded as less than high school, 
high school, some college, or college), gender, age, race 
(white or nonwhite), ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic), 
and marital status. The HRS also follows individuals into 
nursing homes (and they are part of our estimation sample), 
and we use nursing home residence in some of our analyses 
as an indirect marker of cognitive problems.
We use the HRS weights to estimate prevalence of de-
mentia. The handful of missing values in the variables 
was replaced by their modes, such as being white or being 
married.
Because the HRS core lacks a direct measure of dementia 
status, 856 respondents underwent a detailed in-home clin-
ical assessment for dementia as part of ADAMS between 
2001 and 2003. The duration of the assessment was 3–4 h. 
The data from the assessment were studied by an expert 
panel which assigned a final diagnosis of (a) dementia, (b) 
cognitive impairment, but not dementia (CIND), or (c) 
normal cognitive function.
Heeringa and colleagues (2009) discuss the details of the 
data collection. Originally, a stratified sample of 1,770 indi-
viduals aged 70 or older was selected from the 2000 and 
2002 HRS based on their performance on the HRS cogni-
tive questions as well as their age and gender. Individuals 
with lower cognitive status were selected with higher prob-
abilities. Those selected were contacted around a year after 
their last HRS interview. Of these, 48.4% participated in 
the ADAMS, 12.9% had died, 28.2% refused to participate, 
and 10.5% did not participate for other reasons. Because 
of the stratified sampling and attrition, the ADAMS sample 
does not represent the U.S. population. The HRS devel-
oped weights to deal with the stratified sampling design 
and nonresponse, but not mortality. A correlation between 
mortality and cognitive ability, in itself, does not induce a 
bias in prevalence, it only changes the age of the popula-
tion the sample represents. However, if both mortality and 
the timing of the ADAMS interviews varied by cognition, 
the ADAMS weights may be biased (Heeringa et al., 2009).
Empirical Models
Before we introduce our preferred methodology for esti-
mating dementia from HRS and ADAMS, we discuss an 
alternative approach.
The cutoff approach to estimate prevalence and trends
Clinical assessment for dementia is expensive and not prac-
tical in a large survey like the HRS. An alternative is to use 
an index of cognitive ability based on HRS survey meas-
ures and apply a cutoff point: individuals whose index falls 
below the cutoff are deemed to have dementia. This method 
produces both false positives and false negatives, but if the 
cutoff point is appropriately chosen, prevalence in the sur-
vey will be unbiased for population prevalence. The cutoff 
approach is a simple and transparent research design and 
is commonly used in dementia research (Crimmins, Kim, 
Langa, & Weir, 2011; Herzog & Wallace, 1997; Langa 
et al., 2017).
The cutoff points are normed to particular populations 
(e.g., countries, age groups) but they may not produce good 
prevalence estimates in other populations. For example, 
different cutoff points may be needed for different age and 
education groups (O’Caoimh et al., 2017); for different 
countries and languages (Alegret et al., 2013; Yang et al., 
2016); and for people with different medical symptoms 
S12
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2018, Vol. 73, No. S1
 (Hoops et al., 2009). If populations differ by these or by 
other relevant dimensions, then different cut-points should 
be used for each population.
Because there are both self-interviews and proxy inter-
views, each with its own set of cognitive variables, to apply 
the cutoff approach in the HRS requires finding cut-points 
for each type of interview (Langa et al., 2017). Each cut-
point is calibrated so that dementia prevalence in the rele-
vant HRS subpopulation (self or proxy interview) aged 71 
or older is the same as in the corresponding ADAMS sub-
sample. A weighted average over the two HRS subpopula-
tions yields population prevalence among those 71 or older 
in 2000. These cut points can then be used to estimate 
prevalence in the age range 65–70 and in 2012.
There are, however, several potential issues with using 
the cutoff approach on HRS data age 65+. First, it is not 
obvious that the cutoff point identified for the 71+ year old 
population is appropriate for the 65+ year old population. 
Second, the ADAMS weights did not adjust for mortality 
and interview timing differences by cognition. Third, be-
cause HRS has collected fewer proxy interviews since 2006, 
the distribution of cognition by proxy status likely differs, 
making it possible that the cutoff points used for 2000 
would not be accurate in later waves. We investigate some 
of these issues next.
Mortality differences by cognitive status
The target sample of ADAMS was chosen from the 2000 
and 2002 HRS, with the ADAMS team approaching these 
individuals throughout the following 2 years. Among these 
respondents, however, 12.9% had died by the time they 
were contacted.
The ADAMS weights were designed to deal with the 
stratified sampling design and nonresponse, but not with 
mortality. As Heeringa and colleagues (2009) note, if 
mortality probabilities differ by cognitive status, as well 
as with the timing of the ADAMS interviews, then those 
who survive to participate in ADAMS (about a year after 
the last HRS interview, on average) would not represent 
all selected. As Figure 1 shows, there are substantial differ-
ences in 5-year mortality rates by imputed dementia sta-
tus (using a cutoff approach). Individuals with dementia 
are much more likely to die earlier, and the differences are 
larger at younger ages. Cognitive ability may also corre-
late with interview timing, though we should not expect 
as strong a relationship as with survival. Heeringa and col-
leagues (2009) show that the two phases of ADAMS dif-
fered by cognitive ability and interview timing: the phase 
1 interviews that followed the 2000 HRS were scheduled 
significantly later after HRS interviews than the phase 2 
interviews that followed the 2002 HRS. Moreover, the two 
phases targeted a somewhat different part of the cogni-
tive ability distribution. Furthermore, we also found some 
evidence (not shown here) that within the phases, cogni-
tively more able individuals tended to provide interviews 
somewhat later.
The final ADAMS weights used poststratification to 
weight the final sample to the general population by age 
and gender, but that is unlikely to fully correct for mortality 
and interview timing differences by cognitive ability. A cut-
off approach calibrates the cutoff point so that in 2000 the 
prevalence of dementia in the HRS equals the prevalence of 
dementia in ADAMS. So any bias in ADAMS is carried over 
to the 2000 HRS.
As Heeringa and colleagues (2009) discuss, the preferred 
methodology to account for survival and interview timing 
would be to model cognition and survival jointly, which is 
what we do.
Selection into proxy interviews
HRS interviewers are instructed to obtain self-interviews 
if possible, and to use proxies only when the sampled in-
dividual is unable to complete the interview, which, in the 
older age group, would typically be due to cognitive limita-
tions. Proxy rates have varied across groups and time. For 
example, the fraction of proxy interviews among respond-
ents aged 65 years or older decreased from 12.2% in 2000 
to 6.9% in 2012.
Table 1 shows that the share of proxy interviews could 
be quantitatively important for the estimates of trends 
using a simple linear decomposition and a cutoff approach 
to define dementia. Dementia prevalence decreased slightly 
in self-interviews but increased among those with proxy 
interviews. Overall, the fraction of proxies explains all of 
the estimated trends in dementia. An approximate 5 per-
centage point fewer proxy interviews and approximately 
50 percentage point difference in prevalence leads to a 2.5 
percentage point decrease in overall prevalence of dementia, 
Figure 1. 5-Year mortality rates by imputed dementia status, HRS 
1998–2008, age 65–95, weighted. The publicly available HRS includes 
the years and months (but not the days) of the interviews and of deaths. 
5-Year mortality rates are estimated by investigating if individuals are 
alive 5 years and 0 months after their HRS interviews. Dementia status 
is imputed using the cutoff approach of Langa and colleagues (2017), in 
which individuals represented by a proxy are imputed to have dementia 
if they scored 6 or higher on an 11-point scale of cognitive problems, 
and self respondents are imputed to have dementia if they scored 6 or 
lower on a 27-point scale of working and episodic memory.

 which is close to the total decrease of 2.7 percentage points. 
This observation does not necessarily mean the decline in 
prevalence associated with the decline in proxy interviews 
is incorrect: it means that selection into proxy interviews 
deserves further investigation.
The sharp decrease in the proportion of interviews con-
ducted by proxy may indicate improvements in cognitive 
status or changes in interviewing protocols. The unadjusted 
cutoff methodology cannot distinguish between these two 
explanations. Why did the fraction of proxy interviews 
decrease? Two reasons are likely. First, the HRS has col-
lected far more face-to-face (FTF) interviews since 2006 
so as to collect biomarkers and other items that must be 
collected directly from the individual participant: among 
those aged more than 65, the proportion of interviews 
that were FTF increased from 22% in 2000 to 61% in 
2012 (Supplementary Table D3). FTF interviews are more 
likely to be self-interviews than telephone interviews 
(Supplementary Table D4). Because the choice of FTF or 
telephone mode has been randomized since 2006, we can 
estimate the causal effect of FTF interviews on proxy sta-
tus. Supplementary Table D5 implements a fixed effect 
(FE), and an IV model where we instrumented FTF status 
by the random intended FTF variable. We found that the 
effect of FTF on the probability of obtaining proxy inter-
views is negative, as expected, but the magnitude of the 
effect is not large. Even if we take the larger FE estimate, we 
find that FTF status could explain only about 1 percentage 
point [0.027 × (60.6 − 22.3) = 1.03] of the 5.3 percentage 
point decrease in proxies from 2000 to 2012.
Second, the proportion of proxy interviews may have 
decreased because of HRS efforts to collect more self-
interviews, which are considered to be of higher quality. 
Moreover, it is likely that the effort to collect more self-
interviews was more successful among cognitively able 
individuals, which would change the distribution of cogni-
tive ability in proxy interviews.
The cutoff methodology estimates dementia prevalence 
in proxy and self-interviews separately. The cutoff points 
are calibrated so that the prevalence of dementia in the 
2000 HRS is the same as in ADAMS. When these cutoff 
points are used for a different target population, such as 
proxy and self-interviews in the 2012 HRS, the prevalence 
estimates may be biased. In Supplementary Appendix A, 
we show that there are two cases under which the cut-
off method provides valid estimates in a different target 
population:
1. If the cutoff predicts dementia status with 100% preci-
sion (i.e., there is no classification error).
2. If the distribution of cognitive abilities is the same in the 
calibration and the target populations.
If both of these conditions fail, the cutoff points may 
not be valid in the target population. The Supplementary 
Appendix shows that under reasonable conditions preva-
lence is downward biased if the target population has 
lower cognitive abilities, on average, than the calibration 
population. Table 2 shows the fraction of interviewees 
with cognitive limitations in proxy interviews reported by 
the interviewers. We find a 10 percentage point increase 
in the fraction of respondents with cognitive limitations. 
From this, we infer that respondents with higher abilities, 
who might have been interviewed by proxy in 2000, were 
given self-interviews in 2012. This evidence, together with 
the fact the cognitive measures (whether from self-inter-
views or proxy interviews) are not perfect measures of 
true cognition, imply that the prevalence of dementia in 
the 2012 HRS proxy interviews may be downward biased. 
The Supplementary Appendix shows that the magnitude 
of the bias can be substantial depending on parameter 
values.
Altogether, because of the changing distribution of cog-
nitive ability within proxy and self-interviews, it is likely 
that unadjusted cutoff points are not accurate in 2012, al-
though the magnitude of the bias is not easy to identify 
without developing a model that fully accounts for the 
changes in interviewing protocols, which we will do next.

have dementia if they scored 6 or higher on an 11-point scale of cognitive 
problems, and self respondents are imputed to have dementia if they scored 
6 or lower on a 27-point scale of working and episodic memory. The sample

 Our model of dementia prevalence
Based on our findings, we model both selection into proxy 
interviews, and the additional problems that we have 
discussed: the relationship between actual (unobserved) 
cognitive ability and cognitive scores, mortality, ADAMS 
interview timing, and nonparticipation. Here, we sketch 
the model; the complete specification is found in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Cognitive ability, which is not observed, has a normal 
distribution in the population; an individual has dementia 
if cognitive ability falls below a cutpoint which does not 
change over time. The observed self and proxy scores in the 
HRS depend on (latent) cognitive ability, but they do not 
perfectly reveal dementia status.
Whether individuals are interviewed in proxy interviews 
is modeled as a probit which depends on latent cognitive 
ability, and the dependence can change over time to permit 
the apparent change in the HRS protocol for proxy inter-
views. We modeled invitation to the two phases of ADAMS 
separately for proxies and nonproxies as functions of the 
cognition-age-gender strata used by HRS (Heeringa et al., 
2009). Mortality is modeled in a Gompertz framework. 
Of the ADAMS target sample of 1770, 1430 individu-
als (81%) died by the latest HRS interview in 2014. For 
them, the time of death is observed, and we measure it to 
the precision of 0.1 years. The survivors to the 2014 wave 
are modeled as right censored cases. The lag between the 
ADAMS interviews and the previous HRS interviews (2000 
or 2002) is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution. 
Conditional on being invited and surviving to ADAMS, 
actual participation depends on cognition and potentially 
other covariates.
We added covariates, such as education, age, race, and 
health, to the equations that specify cognitive ability, proxy 
selection, observed cognitive scores, mortality, and the tim-
ing of and participation in the ADAMS interview so as to 
increase the precision of the dementia probabilities. All 
of these variables are interacted with interview waves so 
that the estimated trends in dementia probabilities are not 
affected by trends in these variables; they are only affected 
by trends in the self and proxy scores and the fraction of 
proxy interviews. We included a cubic polynomial of age in 
all equations. As the ADAMS did not include 65–70 year 
old individuals in its sample, our model assumes that the 
predicted effect of age on cognition identified from the 71+ 
sample can be extrapolated to the younger 65–70 year old 
group via the polynomial.
We also experimented with added flexibility to the equa-
tions relating latent cognitive ability to observed cognitive 
scores. Our chosen model includes a cubic polynomial of 
cognition. We found that this flexibility was important to 
accurately recover dementia prevalence in the 2000 HRS.
This is a fully specified model, which we estimated 
by maximum simulated likelihood. After estimating the 
model, we estimated the probabilities of dementia for 
each individual in 2000 and 2012, which are functions 
of the estimated model parameters and all the observable 
covariates: demographics, health, proxy interview status 
and, the HRS self and proxy scores. The average of these 
dementia probabilities provides a consistent estimate of 
dementia prevalence in 2000 and 2012. The standard 
errors are estimated by an adapted version of Krinksy 
and Robb (1986). The Supplementary Appendix provides 
details.
The main identification assumption of the model is that 
the distribution of self and proxy scores in the HRS, condi-
tional on latent cognitive ability, is the same in 2000 as in 
2012. Any improvements in the HRS self and proxy scores 
would therefore mark improvements in cognitive ability. 
This framework overcomes the problem of selection into 
proxy interviews by modeling it as a function of latent cog-
nitive ability. We tested the performance of the model on 
a synthetic dataset, and we found that the model accur-
ately recovered the true parameters as well as prevalence 
and trends.
Results
Trends in Subjectively Rated Memory, IADL 
Limitations and Nursing Home Residence
Some variables that are known to correlate with cognitive 
ability are available both in proxy and in self-interviews. 
These include subjectively rated memory, number of limita-
tions in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and 
whether the respondent lives in a nursing home. As they are 
available in all interviews, they do not suffer from selection 
into proxy interviews.
Table 3 shows the trends in those variables. We find little 
improvement in subjectively rated memory except among 
older females, for whom the proportion with poor memory 
decreased by more than 4 percentage points. We find some 
improvements in IADL: the fraction living with more than 
three such limitations decreased from 8.0% in 2000 to 
7.0% in 2012, with a noticeably larger decrease among 
males. The overall proportion living in nursing homes also 
decreased from 4.6% in 2000 to 2.9% in 2012. These 
trends indicate some moderate improvements in cognitive 
ability for HRS respondents 65 years of age or older.
Results of the Dementia Model
We estimated three alternative specifications of the model. 
The detailed output is found in Supplementary Table D6. 
The first specification does not allow changes in selection 
into proxy interviews and does not model interview timing 
in ADAMS. Instead, it assumes that selection into proxy 
interviews was the same in 2000 and 2012, and the tim-
ing of ADAMS interview was uncorrelated with cognition. 
Our second specification models ADAMS interview timing 
as a function of cognitive ability and other covariates (to 
deal with the mortality problem), but still ignores changes 
in selection into proxy interviews. Our third specification 
S15
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2018, Vol. 73, No. S1
 models both ADAMS interview timing and changes in 
selection into proxy interviews by including time varying 
covariates in the selection equation.
Supplementary Table D6 shows that the model output 
conforms to expectations: (a) it correctly finds that there 
were far fewer proxy interviews in 2012 than in 2000; (b) 
individuals with higher levels of cognitive ability were less 
likely to have proxy interviews; (c) cognitively more able 
individuals live longer even when the other demographic 
controls are applied; (d) cognitively more able individuals 
were interviewed later in ADAMS, on average; and (e) cog-
nition was a positive predictor of participation in phase 1 
of ADAMS and uncorrelated with participation in phase 2.
Table 4 shows the main results: prevalence and trends 
by age and gender using the output from Supplementary 
Table D6. The specification without interview timing and 
proxy selection adjustment estimates that the prevalence of 
dementia in the 65+ population decreased from 11.9% in 
2000 to 9.8% in 2012, a statistically significant decrease of 
17.7%. Adjusting for interview timing (mortality) makes 
very little difference, which is evidence that the ADAMS 
weights are not biased. (Recall that the ADAMS weights 
assumed that interview timing was uncorrelated with 
cognition.)
Our preferred third specification shows a decrease in the 
prevalence of dementia from 12.0% in 2000 to 10.5% in 
2012 among those 65 years and older, which is equivalent 
to a statistically significant (p < .01) 1.5 percentage points, 
or 12.6%. Thus, accounting for selection into proxy inter-
views reduced the estimated decline from 17.7% to 12.6%. 
There was a larger decrease in the prevalence of dementia 
among 75–84 year old females (22.9%) and 65–74 year 
old males (35.0%). Estimated prevalence increased among 
65–74 year old females by 3.3% (not significant).
In results not shown we found that both in self and in 
proxy interviews the fraction of individuals with dementia 
increased; yet population prevalence (weighted average of 
the two groups) decreased because of the reduced fraction 
of proxy interviews in 2012. The increase in within group 
prevalence of dementia is consistent with the hypothesis 
that in 2012 the more able from the potential pool of prox-
ies were selected into self-interviews, reducing the quality 
of both the proxy and the self-interview pool.
Because of the increasing population size of the 65+ year 
old group between 2000 and 2012, about 11.6% more peo-
ple had dementia in 2012 than in 2000 despite the decrease 
in prevalence rates (Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
We estimated that, based on the nationally representative 
HRS, dementia prevalence among those aged 65 or older 
declined statistically significantly between 2000 and 2012 
but that the decline was less than reported in previous lit-
erature. Compared with that literature, we addressed sev-
eral methodological issues. First, the weights provided in 
ADAMS did not adjust for interview timing and mortality. 
As long as both mortality and the timing of the ADAMS 
interviews differed by cognition, the provided weights 
were biased. Even though we showed evidence that cog-
nition predicted both survival and interview timing, the 
implied bias was found to be negligible, and the ADAMS 
weights are practically unbiased. Second, we investigated 
the changes in selection into proxy interviews (the fact that 
HRS started collecting fewer interviews by proxies after 
2006), and we found that it had a detectable effect on esti-
mated trends in dementia: the adjustment increased demen-
tia prevalence in recent years and, thus, made the estimated 
negative trend in dementia less steep. Third, we explicitly 
modeled the dependence of dementia on age.
Our preferred specification shows a decrease in the 
prevalence of dementia among those at least 65 years of

 age from 12.0% in 2000 to 10.5% in 2012, or by about 
12.6%. A similar estimated decline in dementia prevalence 
was reported by Matthews and colleagues (2013) using 
English data, who reported a decline from 8.3% in 1989–
1994 to 6.5% in 2008–2011, equivalent to a 1 percentage 
point or 12% decline per decade. Some researchers found 
smaller or even zero decline in dementia prevalence (Rocca 
et al., 2011 using U.S. data; Wu et al., 2016 reporting about 
Swedish and Dutch data). Langa and colleagues (2017), 
however, using the same dataset and time period as we did, 
reported about twice as large a decline. Their methodology 
was based on the cutoff approach in which adjusting for 
changes in selection into proxy interviews was not possible. 
We note, however, that even in the specification that was 
most similar to the one used by Langa and colleagues we 
found a smaller decline in dementia prevalence than they 
did. The cutoff and our modeling frameworks are different 
in many ways. First, our model included covariates other 
than the cognitive variables, such as age, education, race, 
and health. Second, conditional on age, we used a slightly 
broader sample, about 2% larger, by retaining individuals 
who had some missing data. Third, the composite cogni-
tion scores we used were based on a larger set of variables. 
Fourth, the modeling techniques were, as discussed, quite 
different.
We suggest that researchers use a probabilistic approach 
rather than the cutoff approach and model selection into 
proxy interviews when they estimate prevalence and trends 
in the HRS. This is particularly important when the study 
period includes years both before and after 2006, because 
of the large change in the fraction of proxy interviews. 
A probability approach also helps overcome the bias 
(toward zero) in subgroup differences in prevalence.
Our approach has some shortcomings. It is consider-
ably harder to use than the cutoff approach. Our model 
uses functional form assumptions that are necessary, but it 
is unclear how much these assumptions contribute to the 
estimated trends. We assumed that latent cognition has a 
normal distribution in the population, and that there is a 
simple relationship between cognition and the HRS out-
come variables; if any of these assumptions are inaccurate, 
then our model may lead to biased estimates. We found,

 for example, that we needed to add at least a cubic polyno-
mial of cognition into the equations of the HRS cognitive 
outcomes to recover prevalence in the 2000 HRS. But we 
have no direct evidence about whether a higher-order poly-
nomial is required. The HRS is currently collecting a new 
ADAMS-like study, the HCAP, which will allow testing the 
accuracy of these modeling assumptions in the future.
