Abstract
Reproducibility in animal research is alarmingly low, and a lack of scientific rigor has been
proposed as a major cause. Systematic reviews found low reporting rates of measures
against risks of bias (e.g., randomization, blinding), and a correlation between low reporting
rates and overstated treatment effects. Reporting rates of measures against bias are thus
used as a proxy measure for scientific rigor, and reporting guidelines (e.g., ARRIVE) have
become a major weapon in the fight against risks of bias in animal research. Surprisingly,
animal scientists have never been asked about their use of measures against risks of bias
and how they report these in publications. Whether poor reporting reflects poor use of such
measures, and whether reporting guidelines may effectively reduce risks of bias has there-
fore remained elusive. To address these questions, we asked in vivo researchers about
their use and reporting of measures against risks of bias and examined how self-reports
relate to reporting rates obtained through systematic reviews. An online survey was sent out
to all registered in vivo researchers in Switzerland (N = 1891) and was complemented by
personal interviews with five representative in vivo researchers to facilitate interpretation of
the survey results. Return rate was 28% (N = 530), of which 302 participants (16%) returned
fully completed questionnaires that were used for further analysis. According to the
researchers’ self-report, they use measures against risks of bias to a much greater extent
than suggested by reporting rates obtained through systematic reviews. However, the
researchers’ self-reports are likely biased to some extent. Thus, although they claimed to be
reporting measures against risks of bias at much lower rates than they claimed to be using
these measures, the self-reported reporting rates were considerably higher than reporting
rates found by systematic reviews. Furthermore, participants performed rather poorly when
asked to choose effective over ineffective measures against six different biases. Our results
further indicate that knowledge of the ARRIVE guidelines had a positive effect on scientific
rigor. However, the ARRIVE guidelines were known by less than half of the participants
(43.7%); and among those whose latest paper was published in a journal that had endorsed
the ARRIVE guidelines, more than half (51%) had never heard of these guidelines. Our
results suggest that whereas reporting rates may underestimate the true use of measures
against risks of bias, self-reports may overestimate it. To a large extent, this discrepancy

 can be explained by the researchers’ ignorance and lack of knowledge of risks of bias and
measures to prevent them. Our analysis thus adds significant new evidence to the assess-
ment of research integrity in animal research. Our findings further question the confidence
that the authorities have in scientific rigor, which is taken for granted in the harm-benefit
analyses on which approval of animal experiments is based. Furthermore, they suggest that
better education on scientific integrity and good research practice is needed. However, they
also question reliance on reporting rates as indicators of scientific rigor and highlight a need
for more reliable predictors.
Introduction
Reproducibility is the cornerstone of the scientific method and fundamental for the ethical jus-
tification of in vivo research. Mounting evidence of poor reproducibility (e.g. [1,2]) and trans-
lational failure of preclinical animal research [3–5] has therefore raised serious concerns about
the scientific validity [6,7] and ethical justification [8,9] of in vivo research. Possible reasons
for poor reproducibility include a lack of education [10,11], perverse incentives [12], ignorance
of standards of good research practice [2], as well as scientific misconduct and fraud [13]. All
of these may result in poor experimental design and conduct, thereby compromising scientific
validity [5,14–17].
Poor scientific validity has important scientific, economic, and ethical implications. It ham-
pers scientific and medical progress and leads to translational failure through misguided
research efforts (e.g. [3,18–21]). It also increases R&D costs in drug development [22], result-
ing in higher health care costs (e.g. [17]). Based on estimates of irreproducibility in preclinical
research, up to USD 28B/year may be spent in the US alone on irreproducible preclinical
research [19]. Furthermore, poor scientific validity imposes unnecessary harm and distress
upon research animals (e.g. [8,9]), raises false hopes in patients awaiting cures for their dis-
eases, and puts patients in clinical trials at risk [23].
Much of the evidence of poor experimental design and conduct in animal research rests on
systematic reviews and meta-analyses revealing low rates of reporting of measures against risks
of bias (e.g., randomization: mean = 27% [range = 9–55%], blinding: 28.7% [0–61%], sample
size calculation: 0.5% [0–3%]) in the primary literature (e.g. [23,24–33]). Consequently, report-
ing guidelines such as the ‘Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments’ (ARRIVE)
guidelines [34] (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines) or the revised ‘Reporting Check-
list for Life Science Articles’ by the Nature publishing group (http://www.nature.com/authors/
policies/reporting.pdf) were promoted in view of improving the situation. For example, the
ARRIVE guidelines consist of a checklist of 20 items of information that all publications
reporting animal research should include, including details of methods used to reduce bias
such as randomisation and blinding. Despite general consensus about the benefits of such
guidelines (> 1000 journals have endorsed the ARRIVE guidelines by September 2016), Baker
et al. [35] found that reporting rates of measures against bias remained low in PLoS and Nature
journals even after they had endorsed the ARRIVE guidelines. Although reporting rates are
generally increasing, they are still rather low [26].
In the past, the reporting of measures against bias such as randomization, blinding, sample
size calculation and others was largely optional and–to some extent–this is still the case today.
Therefore, reporting rates of these measures may not be reliable indicators of scientific rigor.
Whether poor reporting reflects poor scientific validity, however, has never been systematically

 studied. Nevertheless, some indications exist that scientific rigor is often lacking, and that risks
of bias are associated with poor reporting. For example, in neuroscience research most experi-
mental studies are underpowered, and low statistical power in combination with null hypothe-
sis significance testing and publication bias may lead to inflated effect size estimates from the
published literature (e.g. [36]); inappropriate statistical methods often lead to spurious conclu-
sions (e.g. [37,38,39]); and several systematic reviews indicate that low reporting rates of mea-
sures against bias are associated with larger effect sizes (e.g. [28,29,30,40]). This has raised
concerns that there may be systemic flaws in the way we conduct and report research [2]. Sev-
eral authors warned that the quality of animal research is (unacceptably) poor (e.g. [41]) and
stricter adherence to standards of best research practice is necessary if the scientific validity of
animal research is to be improved [15].
In light of the many studies published on poor reporting of measures against bias and the
level of attention they received [5,7,18,42], it is surprising that so far no study has investigated
the relationship between what researchers do in the laboratory and what they report in their
publications. The primary aim of the present study, therefore, was to assess the researchers’
view of the quality of experimental conduct and how this relates to what they report in the pri-
mary literature. Using a questionnaire sent out to all registered animal scientists actively
involved with ongoing animal experiments in Switzerland, we assessed (i) the researchers’
awareness and knowledge of risks of bias in animal research, (ii) the measures they take to
avoid bias in their own research, and (iii) how they report these measures in their publications.
To aid interpretation of the results, we also conducted qualitative interviews with a small sub-
set of these researchers to get insight into personal viewpoints, underlying motivations, and
compliance with quality standards.
Methods
Online survey
An anonymous online survey was developed using the free software Limesurvey [43]. The sur-
vey contained a total of 21 questions divided into seven sections. Thus, participants were asked
about (i) their area of research, and the species they were mainly working with; (ii) their work
institution, including certification; (iii) experimental design and conduct, including which of
seven primary measures against risks of bias (Table 1) participants generally apply to their
own research; (iv) the journal of their latest scientific publication and which of the seven mea-
sures against bias listed in Table 1 they had reported in that publication (or the reasons for not
reporting them); (v) awareness of risks of bias, and knowledge about measures to prevent
them; (vi) familiarity with the ARRIVE (or similar) guidelines, and whether they adhered to
them; and (vii) the participants’ personal research experience. The questionnaire was piloted
among five animal researchers to ensure clarity. Participants had to answer all questions of a
section before being able to move on to the next section, however, for most questions they had
the option of not answering questions by ticking ‘no answer’, ‘do not know’, or ‘not relevant’.
The full questionnaire is available in S1 Text.
Study population and data collection
The online survey was set up as a partially closed survey, for which potential participants
(N = 1891) were invited via email. Email addresses were provided by the Swiss Federal Food
Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) and included all researchers involved in ongoing animal
experiments in Switzerland, which were registered by the FSVO as experimenters, study direc-
tors, or resource managers of animal facilities. The questionnaire was online for seven weeks;

 after five weeks a reminder for participation was sent to all addressees to increase response
rate.
Ethics statement
Given that there were no known risks associated with this research study, participants of the
survey and the interviews were not a vulnerable group of people, and complete confidentiality
was guaranteed, we saw no need for formal ethical review before the study began.
Data analysis
The online survey generated 530 questionnaires (return rate: 28%), of which 302 (57%) were
fully completed while 228 were only partially completed. Partially completed questionnaires
were only used for assessing a potential bias in the sample of fully completed questionnaires,
while only the latter (16% of the total sample) were used for further analysis. Survey data were
exported to MS Excel, checked for inconsistencies, and revised if necessary with suitable cor-
rection rules. Each question of the survey was analyzed quantitatively in terms of proportions
of the answers given by the participants.
Besides analyzing each question separately, internal validity scores (IVS) were calculated for
each participant for a) experimental conduct (IVSExp), and b) reporting in the latest publica-
tion (IVSPub). The scores were based on the measures against risks of bias (Table 1) and were
equal to the number of these measures claimed to be applied (under a, Eq 1) or reported
(under b, Eq 2) by the participant, divided by the number of measures that were applicable to
a) or b), respectively.

 comparison between the scores (change of denominator in Eq 1 to “6—number of no answer”).
In addition, the inuence of several independent variables (descriptors of the participants
derived from the online survey) on these scores was investigated through an information theo-
retic modelling approach using generalized linear models (glm). The Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) was used to compare candidate models [44] and to retrieve the model which
best described the data [45]. The two scores were modelled with the following main effects
(descriptors): Knowledge of the ARRIVE guidelines (binary; yes, no), host institution (categor-
ical; academia, industry, governmental, private), animal research experience (continuous; no.
of years), the authority (cantonal veterinary ofce) responsible for approving the participants’
applications for animal experiments (categorical; 13 cantons), eld of research (categorical:
basic, applied, other), and the research discipline (categorical: Animal Welfare, Cell Biology/
Biochemistry/Molecular Biology, Ethology, Human Medicine, Para-clinics, Veterinary Medi-
cine, Zoology, other discipline).
Starting with the full model (all descriptors including the interaction term knowledge of
ARRIVE x institution), single term deletion was performed by a stepwise backwards procedure
(drop1 function), eliminating the descriptor with the largest p-value to produce a set of candi-
date models for the model selection process. Besides this set of candidate models, we also
included all univariate models (single descriptors) as well as the null model (only intercept;
total of 12 models). The model comparison was conducted using the function model.sel from
the R-package MuMIn [46]. The model with the lowest BIC was chosen as the one fitting the
data best. Model estimates and 95% confidence intervals were corrected for overdispersion of
the data (glm link function = quasibinomial).
In order to investigate whether the IVSExp and IVSPub were correlated, a Spearman’s Rank
Correlation was performed with the reduced IVS scores (only considering six validity criteria,
i.e., without allocation concealment). Mean differences in IVS between participants of certified
institutions vs. non-certified institutions were investigated with a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test
for both scores. Values for IVS are presented as means ± SD. All statistical analysis were per-
formed using the statistical software R, Version 3.0.3 [47].
Personal Interviews
The online survey was complemented by interviews with five selected researchers representing
the diversity of institutions and areas of research among the participants of the survey. The
interviews are not described in the main text of this article, however, complete information
about the methods, study population, analysis and results of the interviews is provided in S2
Text.
Results
Study population
The 302 participants returning fully completed questionnaires had an average of 15.5
(SD ± 8.6) years of experience in animal research. Most of them were affiliated with academic
institutions (74.5%, N = 225), 14.9% (N = 45) with industry, 4.6% (N = 14) with governmental
research institutions, and 6% (N = 18) with private research institutions. Only 23.8% of the
participants (N = 72) indicated that their institution was formally certified, and 27.2% (N = 82)
that it was not, while almost half of the participants (44.7%) did not know this or did not
answer this question (4.3%) (for a complete table, see S1 Table). Among the 72 participants
indicating that their institution was certified, academics were relatively underrepresented with
only 45.8% compared to 74.5% among the total sample, whereas researchers from

 pharmaceutical industry (29.2% vs. 14.9%), governmental institutions (8.3% vs. 4.6%), and pri-
vate institutions (16.7% vs. 6%) were relatively overrepresented.
Most participants (58.9%, N = 178) attributed their work to basic research and 40.4%
(N = 122) to applied research, while two participants (0.7%) were undecided. The large major-
ity of participants (86.8%) were engaged in biomedical or medical research (for details see
Table 2), and the animals used as experimental subjects were mainly mice (60.6%) and rats
(15.6%) (for details see Table 3). While 14 participants (4.6%) had not yet published their first
paper, most participants (57%, N = 172) had published between 1 and 20 papers, and 116 par-
ticipants (38.4%) had published more than 20 papers.
Measures to avoid bias
When asked which of the seven measures against risks of bias the participants normally used
in the conduct of their experiments (including the answers ‘yes’ and ‘depends’), a large major-
ity ticked primary outcome variable (90%, N = 264), inclusion and exclusion criteria (84%,
N = 245), randomization (86%, N = 248), and statistical analysis plan (82%, N = 240). More
than half also ticked sample size calculation (69%, N = 203) and allocation concealment (52%,

 N = 143), whereas less than half (47%, N = 135) ticked blinded outcome assessment (see Fig
1A white bars). These proportions were corrected for the number of participants ticking ‘no
answer’ (for full results including absolute numbers see S2 Table).
To put these numbers in relation to reporting rates derived from published papers, we
asked participants to state explicitly which of these seven measures against risks of bias they
had reported in their latest published research article. Most of the participants indicated that
they had reported in full details a statistical analysis plan (71%, N = 180) and the primary out-
come variable (78%, N = 177), whereas reporting rates for inclusion and exclusion criteria
(45%, N = 97), randomization (44%, N = 87), sample size calculation (18%, N = 40) and blind-
ing (27%, N = 49) were considerably lower (Fig 1A grey bars). Again, reporting rates were cor-
rected for the number of participants having ticked ‘does not apply to last manuscript’, ‘have
not published so far’, and ‘no answer’.
For each of these bias avoidance measures, between 5.3% (statistical analysis) and 27.5%
(blinding) of the 302 participants considered these measures to be irrelevant with respect to
their latest publication (see “NA” in S2B Table). The most common reason (chosen from a
drop-down list) for not reporting measures against risks of bias in their latest publications was
that it was ‘not necessary’ (from 30% for sample size calculation up to 80% for statistical analy-
sis). Additional reasons were that it was ‘not common’ (up to 39% for sample size calculation),
that they ‘did not think of it’ (up to 19% for primary outcome variable) or space limitations by
the journals (up to 8% for sample size calculation).

 IV scores
The mean IVSExp based on all seven measures against risks of bias was 0.73 (SD ± 0.24,
N = 301). However, to facilitate comparison with the IVSPub, we also calculated an IVSExp
based on six measures only (excluding allocation concealment), resulting in a mean IVSExp of
0.76 (SD± 0.23; N = 301) compared to a mean IVSPub of 0.49 (SD ± 0.29, N = 261). There was a
weak but significant positive correlation between IVSExo and IVSPub (Spearman’s Rank Corre-
lation: S = 2322088, Rho = 0.22, p- value = 0.0004).
Variation in IVSExp was best explained by knowledge of the ARRIVE guidelines and by the
participants’ field of research (BIC = 1132, BICweights = 0.967; ΔBIC to second best model [only
including ARRIVE knowledge] = 7.38). There was a positive effect of ‘ARRIVE knowledge’ on the
IVSExp compared to ‘no knowledge’ (model estimate = 0.406, 95% CI = 0.133–0.683), and negative
effects of ‘basic research’ (model estimate = -0.299, 95% CI = -0.579–-0.0223) and ‘other research’
(model estimate = -2.052, 95% CI = -3.912–-0.526) compared to ‘applied research’ (Fig 2A).
The model including knowledge of the ARRIVE guidelines performed best in explaining
variation in the IVSPub (BIC = 874.24, BICweights = 0.995, ΔBIC to second best model [null
model with intercept only] = 11.4). Again, knowledge of the ARRIVE guidelines had a positive
effect on the IVSPub compared to ‘no knowledge’ (model estimate = 0.461, 95% CI = 0.201–
0.723) (Fig 2B). An overview of the models and selection procedure can be found in S3 Table.

the variation in IVS for (A) experimental conduct and (B) for publications. For (A) one value is missing as no IVS could be calculated, and for (B) 41
values are missing, because participants ticked ‘have not yet published’, gave ‘no answer’ or declared that these questions ‘do not apply to last
manuscript’. For experimental conduct (A), the model including ARRIVE knowledge and research field best explained the IVSExp, whereas for
publications (B), the model including only ARRIVE knowledge best explained the IVSPub. Red squares indicate the mean IVS; black circle the mean of

 The IVSExp was slightly higher in participants from certified institutions (mean IVSExp cer-
tified = 0.81, SD ± 0.30, N = 72) compared to non-certified institutions (mean IVSExo non-cer-
tified = 0.73 ± 0.23, N = 82; Fig 3A), however, this difference was not significant (Wilcox Rank
Sum Test, W = 2490, p = 0.087). Similarly, IVSPub was slightly but not significantly higher
(W = 2144, p = 0.60) in participants working at certified institutions (mean IVSPub =
0.54 ± 0.27, N = 62; mean IVSPub = 0.51 ± 0.30, N = 73; Fig 3B).
Awareness of risk of bias and measures aimed to avoid them
As summarized in Table 4, most participants indicated that they were aware of risks of bias
caused by selective reporting (67.5%, N = 204), selection bias (65.2%, N = 197), and detection
bias (61.9%, N = 187), and that they avoid these risks routinely in their research. Furthermore,
about half of the participants indicated being aware of publication bias (57.6%, N = 174) and
performance bias (48.7%, N = 147), whereas less than one third (29.8%, N = 90) indicated
being aware of attrition bias. However, depending on the type of bias only between 15.6% and
41.7% of the participants indicated being concerned about these biases with respect to their
own research, and between 15.2% and 35.8% of the participants indicated that these biases did
not apply to their own research. Moreover, 10.9% (N = 33) of the participants indicated not
being aware of any of these biases, and 24.2% (N = 73) indicated that they were not concerned
about any of these biases with respect to their own research (Table 4).
Next, we assessed the participants’ knowledge of specific measures against risks of bias. Fig 4
presents their responses when asked what measures they would take to avoid the different types of

 bias. As indicated by the distribution of responses across the different panels, apart from publica-
tion bias (panel D), there was no clear pattern of preference for effective over ineffective measures.
The ARRIVE guidelines were known by 43.7% of the participants (N = 132), of which 24
indicated that they were familiar with these guidelines, 35 that they had read them, and 73 that
they had heard of them. However, the majority of participants (56.3%, N = 170) indicated that
they had never heard of the ARRIVE guidelines before (Fig 5). Among the 132 participants
being aware of the ARRIVE guidelines, most indicated that they adhere to them either gener-
ally (30.3%, N = 40) or occasionally 34.8%, N = 46), while 15.2% (N = 20) answered that they
did not adhere to them and 19.7% (N = 26) did not answer this question.
Consulting the NC3rs Website (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-animal-research-
reporting-vivo-experiments#journals, accessed July 6th 2015), the journals in which partici-
pants had published their latest paper was checked for endorsement of the ARRIVE guidelines.
Of all participants having published at least one research paper (N = 288), 79 (27.4%) had pub-
lished their latest paper in a journal that had endorsed the ARRIVE guidelines (86.1% [N = 68]
from academia, 6.3% [N = 5] from governmental institutions, 5.1% [N = 4] from industry,
2.5% [N = 2] from private research institutions). Among these participants, 16.5% (N = 13)
indicated that they were familiar with the ARRIVE guidelines, 11.4% (N = 9) that they had
read them, and 21.5% (N = 17) that they had heard of them. However, more than half of the
participants who had last published in a journal endorsing the ARRIVE guidelines (51%,
N = 40) indicated that they had never heard of these guidelines.
Apart from the ARRIVE guidelines, 235 participants (77.8%) indicated that they adhered to
other guidelines either regularly (N = 217, 71.8%) or occasionally (N = 18, 6%), while 26 partic-
ipants (8.6%) never followed any guidelines (41 participants [13.6%] did not answer this ques-
tion). Among the 235 participants who did adhere to other guidelines either regularly or
occasionally, 72.3% (N = 170) referred to internal SOPs (Standard Operating Procedure),
59.6% (N = 140) to specific journal guidelines, and 24.2% (N = 57) to various other guidelines
(multiple answers were possible).
Assessment of possible bias in study sample
To assess whether our study sample of fully completed questionnaires (N = 302; 16% of total
survey population) might be biased, we exploited our sample of partially completed question-
naires (N = 228) and compared participant characteristics between these two samples as well
as the primary outcome variable of this study, IVSExp.

 Similar proportions of participants returning partially vs. fully completed questionnaires
ascribed their research to basic research (51.2% vs. 58.9%), applied research (45.5% vs. 40.4%),
or were undecided (2.4% vs. 0.7%), respectively (N = 167 partially completed questionnaires).

 Also, similar proportions were involved in biomedical and medical research (85.6% vs. 86.8%;
N = 167); were using mice (71.5% vs. 60.6%) and rats (13.9% vs. 15.6%; N = 165); and were
affiliated with academic institutions (71.1% vs. 74.5%), industry (15.1% vs. 14.9%), govern-
mental research institutions (5.7% vs. 4.6%), and private research institutions (8.2% vs. 6%;
N = 159), respectively.
In terms of the primary outcome variable, IVSExp, the comparison between our study sam-
ple of fully completed questionnaires and that of partially completed questionnaires for which
the necessary answers were available yielded identical results, with a mean IVSExp of 0.73
(SD ± 0.24; N = 301) for the study sample and a mean IVSExp of 0.73 (SD ± 0.20; N = 99) for
the sample of partially completed questionnaires.

 Discussion
Summary of results
Low reporting rates of measures against risks of bias in the primary literature are widely con-
sidered as a proxy measure of poor experimental conduct. Reporting guidelines (e.g., ARRIVE)
have thus become a major weapon in the fight against risks of bias in animal research. Here we
studied, for the first time, how reporting rates of measures against risks of bias in in vivo
research (e.g. [23,26,28–30,33]) relate to the rates at which such measures are implemented,
according to researchers’ self-reports. Our findings indicate that scientific rigor of animal
research may be considerably better than predicted by reporting rates, as researchers may be
using measures against risks of bias to a much greater extent than suggested by systematic
reviews of the published literature. The large discrepancy suggests that reporting rates may be
poor predictors of scientific rigor in animal research. This is further supported by our finding
that the rates at which researchers claimed to have reported measures against bias in their latest
publication were considerably lower than the rates at which they claimed to have used these
measures in their research.
On the other hand, we found a weak but positive correlation between self-reported use and
self-reported reporting of measures against risks of bias, supporting findings from systematic
reviews indicating that higher reporting rates reflect more rigorous research (e.g. [26,29,48]).
Furthermore, self-reported reporting rates of measures against risks of bias in the researchers’
latest publication were considerably higher than the reporting rates commonly found by sys-
tematic reviews. Taken together, these findings suggest that whereas reporting rates may
underestimate scientific rigor, self-reports may overestimate it. The latter is further supported
by our finding that the researchers’ knowledge of risks of bias, and effective measures to pre-
vent them, was rather limited. Thus, the discrepancy between reporting rates and self-reports
may be partly explained by the researchers’ ignorance of potential risks of bias and measures
to prevent them.
Our findings, therefore, highlight a need for better education and training of researchers in
good research practice to raise their awareness of risks of bias and improve their knowledge
about measures to avoid them. Furthermore, they indicate a need for more reliable predictors
of scientific rigor.
Validity of self-reports
The researchers’ self-reports of their use of measures against risks of bias should be interpreted
with caution, as self-reports may not necessarily reflect the true quality of experimental con-
duct. That the reporting rates of measures against bias claimed by the researchers for their lat-
est publication were considerably higher than the reporting rates generally found by
systematic reviews of the published literature (e.g., randomization 44% vs. 27%, sample size
calculation 18% vs. 0.5%) indicates that the researchers’ self-reports should not be taken at face
value. There are two main ways in which the self-reports may be biased. First, our study popu-
lation (participants having returned fully completed questionnaires) may differ from the over-
all population of in vivo researchers. For example, participants of the survey may be
particularly conscious of risks of bias and the problem of poor reproducibility, which may
have predisposed them to take part in this survey. This could explain better experimental con-
duct and better reporting, compared to the overall population. Alternatively, participants may
have been prone to overestimate their own performance (e.g. [49]). We have only limited data
to assess these two alternatives. However, when comparing the population of participants who
returned fully completed questionnaires with the population of participants who started but

 did not complete the questionnaire, we did not find any major differences in the characteristics
of the participants (e.g., host institution, research animals, type of research), nor in the primary
outcome variable of this study, the internal validity score for experimental conduct (IVSExp).
Given that these two populations of participants together accounted for almost one third of
the overall population of registered in vivo researchers in Switzerland, the difference in report-
ing rates between self-reports and systematic reviews are unlikely to be explained by a system-
atic bias towards better performers in our study sample. This is further supported by the fact
that the participants performed rather poorly when asked about their knowledge of specific
types of bias, and effective measures to avoid these. Overestimation of one’s own performance
tends to be the more pronounced, the less skilled and competent individuals are (i.e., the Kru-
ger-Dunning Effect, [50]). Although researchers are generally highly skilled and competent in
their field of research, the researchers’ limited knowledge of types of bias and measures to
avoid them renders their self-reports at risk for overestimation. We thus conclude that the dif-
ference between what researchers claimed to have reported in their latest paper and reporting
rates found by systematic reviews are more likely explained by the researchers overestimating
their own performance than a bias towards better performers in our study sample.
Subjective bias resulting in overestimation of their own performance may also have affected
the researchers’ self-reports on the actual use of measures against risks of bias. Thus, the true
use of measures against risks of bias may lie anywhere between what has been found to be
reported by systematic reviews, and the researchers’ self-report presented here. Given the large
difference between IVSExp and IVSPub, however, reporting rates found in the literature are
likely to underestimate scientific rigor to a considerable extent.
Reasons for low reporting rates
The main reason for not reporting the use of measures against risks of bias in publications is
that researchers do not find it necessary to report it. This was further corroborated by personal
interviews. Thus, researchers argued, for example, that “certain things are self-evident and do
not need to be reported”, that “the journal did not request to describe it [e.g., randomization]”,
that “good scientific practice” actually implies that the criteria of good research practice are
met without having to stress (i.e., report) this, or that “there is a threshold for what is relevant
to the own laboratory and [what is relevant] to the research community outside the
laboratory”.
However, given the negative relationship between the reporting of measures against risks of
bias and overstatement of treatment effect size (e.g. [28,29,30,40]), and the positive correlation
between IVSPub and IVSExp found here, these statements appear questionable.
Although our findings suggest that scientific rigor in animal research may be considerably
better than predicted by systematic reviews, there clearly is scope for improvement as, for
example, only half of the participants self-reported using blinded outcome assessment (47%)
or allocation concealment (52%). Blinding and allocation concealment, together with proper
randomization procedures, are key measures to avoid selection bias and detection bias (cf.
Table 1) and should be used in every study and reported in every publication (e.g. [5,31,51]).
Effect of knowledge of reporting guidelines on measures of scientific
rigor
To assess the effects of specific characteristics of the researchers or their research on measures
of scientific rigor, we calculated scores of experimental conduct (IVSExp) and reporting
(IVSPub). Similar scores have previously been used to assess scientific rigor in systematic
reviews and meta-analyses of reporting rates in the published literature (e.g., CAMARADES

 checklist [24]). Variation in IVSExp was best explained by knowledge of the ARRIVE guidelines
(yes vs. no) and type of research (applied vs. basic vs. other). Thus, researchers being familiar
with the ARRIVE guidelines and researchers in applied research scored higher on IVSExp, and
researchers knowing the ARRIVE guidelines also scored higher on IVSPub. These findings sup-
port the view that reporting guidelines may improve not only reporting but may actually
improve the use of measures against risks of bias (e.g. [48]). The positive effect of applied
research on IVSExp is more difficult to explain. It has previously been argued that the incentive
for reliable results may be higher in applied research, for example in pharma research where
also economic values are at stake (e.g. [19,52]). However, given the small size of this effect, and
the fact that participants from academia and industry did not differ on both scores (IVSExp:
academia = 0.73 vs. industry = 0.73, Wilcox test: W = 5243, p = 0.70; IVSPub: academia = 0.51
vs. industry = 0.46, Wilcox test: W = 3900, p = 0.40) suggests that it should be interpreted with
caution.
Despite loud calls for better reporting (e.g. [53]) and the widespread endorsement of report-
ing guidelines by many scientific journals (e.g. [34,54–56]), reporting has not yet improved
much [35]. Thus, without active enforcement of reporting guidelines by journal editors and
reviewers, the situation may not change [57]. This is also confirmed by results of this study:
more than half of the participants having published their latest article in a journal that has
endorsed the ARRIVE guidelines admitted that they had never heard of these guidelines. This
ignorance is surprising given the wide coverage that the ARRIVE guidelines have received and
we may only speculate about the reason for this. Most likely, researchers can still ignore them–
and may continue to do so–as long as the journals do not enforce them more strictly.
This may reflect a general attitude we observed among the scientists we interviewed. While
they agreed that guidelines for the design and conduct of experiments may be useful, they
were skeptical towards reporting guidelines. As one interviewee put it, “introducing more
checklists to tick boxes does not increase the quality of science”. Thus, publication checklists
are perceived as a sign of increasing over-regulation and bureaucracy and may therefore be
ignored. Similarly, Begley and Ioannidis [39] warned that the burden of bureaucracy might
lead to normative responses without measurable benefits for the quality of research and repro-
ducibility. However, Minnerup and colleagues [48] recently showed that the quality of research
published in the journal Stroke increased after the implementation of the ‘Basic Science Check-
list’. Thus, if enforced by reviewers and editors, adequate checklists may well be conductive to
the quality of research.
Knowledge of risks of bias and measures to avoid them
Increasing evidence of bias associated with poor experimental conduct and reporting (e.g.
[5,23,26,29,30,33]) is only partly mirrored by the participants’ answers to the questionnaire.
Thus, only about two thirds of the participants (58–68%) indicated being aware of selective
reporting, selection bias, detection bias, and publication bias, and less than half of them were
actually ‘concerned’ about such biases (35–42%) with respect to their own research. Further-
more, between 15% and 25% indicated that these biases were ‘not relevant’ to their own
research. These results reflect a certain ignorance of risks of bias in experimental conduct,
combined with a lack of knowledge about these risks and about effective measures to avoid
them. Thus, when participants were asked about effective measures against specific types of
bias from a list of 10 potential measures, there was no consistent preference of effective over
ineffective measures, except for publication bias (and, to some extent, for selective reporting).
In particular, participants performed poorly when asked for measures against attrition bias,
detection bias, and performance bias, respectively. This lack of understanding may have

 contributed to the participants overestimating the quality of their own experimental conduct.
Therefore, besides the implementation of reporting guidelines (e.g. [34,48,56,58,59]), which
will raise awareness of risks of bias, we conclude that researchers may need better training in
scientific integrity and good research practice in view of minimizing risks of bias in future
research.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that reporting rates of measures against risks of bias may not be reliable
measures of scientific rigor in animal research, and that better measures are needed. However,
although the researchers’ self-reports suggest that the actual use of measures against risks of
bias may be considerably higher than predicted by the low reporting rates in the published lit-
erature, self-reports may overestimate their true use. Indeed, the results presented here indi-
cate that there may be considerable scope for improvement of scientific rigor in experimental
conduct of animal research, and that concepts and methods of good research practice should
play a more important role in the education of young researchers (e.g. [11]). It is quite possible
that lack of scientific rigor contributes to the so called “reproducibility crisis” (e.g. [3]). How-
ever, scientific rigor in experimental conduct is not the only factor affecting reproducibility,
and perhaps not even the most important one; poor construct validity of animal models (e.g.
[9,17]) and poor external validity due to highly standardized laboratory conditions (e.g. [8,60–
63]) are important alternative causes. Further research is therefore needed on the effects of dif-
ferent aspects of scientific validity on reproducibility, to assess their scope for improvement
and in view of prioritizing strategies towards improvement beyond reporting guidelines.
