Abstract
Background: Experiencing a false positive (FP) screening mam-
mogram is economically, physically, and emotionally burden-
some, which may affect future screening behavior by delaying the
next scheduled mammogram or by avoiding screening altogether.
We sought to examine the impact of a FP screening mammogram
on the subsequent screening mammography behavior.
Methods: Delay in obtaining subsequent screening was defined
as any mammogram performed more than 12 months from index
mammogram. The Kaplan–Meier (product limit) estimator and
Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate the
unadjusted delay and the hazard ratio (HR) of delay of the
subsequent screening mammogram within the next 36 months
from the index mammogram date.
Results: A total of 650,232 true negative (TN) and 90,918 FP
mammograms from 261,767 women were included. The likeli-
hood of a subsequent mammogram was higher in women
experiencing a TN result than women experiencing a FP result
(85.0% vs. 77.9%, P < 0.001). The median delay in returning to
screening was higher for FP versus TN (13 months vs. 3 months, P
< 0.001). Women with TN result were 36% more likely to return to
screening in the next 36 months compared with women with a FP
result HR ¼ 1.36 (95% CI, 1.35–1.37). Experiencing a FP mam-
mogram increases the risk of late stage at diagnosis compared with
prior TN mammogram (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: Women with a FP mammogram were more likely
to delay their subsequent screening compared with women with a
TN mammogram.
Impact: A prior FP experience may subsequently increase the
4-year cumulative risk of late stage at diagnosis. Cancer Epidemiol

Introduction
Screening mammography is an established routine public
health procedure for the early detection of breast cancer and has
been shown to reduce mortality from the disease (1). Along with
the benefits of early detection, mammography screening is also
associated with false positive (FP) results that lead to unnecessary
additional imaging and biopsy procedures as well as associated
financial costs, lost time, and psychologic and physical morbidity
(2–4). FP rates have been estimated to be as high as 10% of
screening mammograms (5), and roughly 50% of women who
screen annually for 10 years can expect at least one FP mammo-
gram finding, of which 7%–17% will require biopsy (6, 7). The FP
screening mammogram issue is part of an ongoing debate regard-
ing the extent to which the risk of mammography screening might
outweigh the benefits in certain women (8, 9). Therefore, the most
recent guidelines set forth by the United States Preventative Ser-
vices Task Force (USPSTF) advised against routine screening in
womenaged 40–49yearsof age and women75 years orolder (10).
Furthermore, a FP mammogram could lead women to alter
their future screening behavior, either by delaying the next sched-
uled mammogram or foregoing the exam altogether. Studies that
have examined the potential impact of a FP mammogram on
subsequent adherence to screening mammography recommen-
dations have yielded inconsistent findings. Several studies found
that re-screening rates were actually higher among women who
experienced a FP as opposed to a TN (11, 12), whereas other
studies found no difference in re-screening rates based on screen-
ing mammography outcome (13–16). Still other reports docu-
mented lower re-screening rates for women experiencing FP
compared with those with TN mammograms (17–20). A 2007
meta-analysis which pooled data from the above studies found
that in Europe and Canada, women who experienced a FP
screening mammogram were less likely to return for their next
screen compared with women with TN screen finding. Conversely,
women in the United States were associated with greater subse-
quent screening mammography adherence after experiencing a FP
(21). The primary study objective was to examine the impact of a
FP screening mammogram on the receipt of subsequent screening
mammography among a racially diverse population in a network
of mammography centers within a large health care organization.
The secondary objective was to determine whether the experience

 of a FP result at index mammogram increases the risk of subse-
quent late-stage disease for those women subsequently diagnosed
with breast cancer.
Materials and Methods
Mammography screening data on women were obtained from
a large health care organization with multiple facilities in the
greater metropolitan Chicago area. Facilities within this health-
care organization used PenRad to collect radiology information
and patient characteristics (22). PenRad was first introduced in
2001 and was implemented at all facilities by 2005. Breast cancer
incidence data were obtained from the Illinois State Cancer
Registry (ISCR; ref. 23), which collects information on all incident
cancer cases in the state of Illinois.
The radiology dataset included patient-level data on demo-
graphic characteristics and risk factors, and exam-level data on
procedure types and results that were performed between January
1, 2001, and December 31, 2014. Each mammogram was inter-
preted by the reading radiologist and was given a score using the
American College of Radiology (ACR) classification system
known as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS).
BIRADS assessment for screening and diagnostic mammography
ranges from 0 to 5 such that 0 ¼ need additional imaging
evaluation, 1 ¼ negative finding, 2 ¼ benign finding, 3 ¼ probably
benign finding, 4 ¼ suspicious abnormality, and 5 ¼ finding
highly suggestive of malignancy.
Family history was self-reported and was defined as none (no
first- or second-degree relatives affected), weak (only second-
degree relatives affected), moderate (one first-degree relative
over age 50 affected), and strong (multiple first-degree relatives
affected or one under age 50). Age was determined by taking
the difference between date of index mammogram and date of
birth. Race/ethnicity was self-reported as nonHispanic (nH)
white, nH black, Hispanic, other, and unknown. Personal his-
tory of prior biopsy was defined as present if a prior biopsy
existed in the radiology dataset or if it was self-reported. Time
since last mammogram was defined as 9–18 months, 19–30
months, >30 months and no prior mammogram based on the
radiology dataset. Breast density was defined following the ACR
classification as composed almost entirely of fat, scattered
fibroglandular densities, heterogeneously dense and extremely
dense.
Women with a prior history of breast cancer or who developed
breast cancer anytime during the study period were excluded from
these analyses as were women with a history of breast reduction,
breast implants, and breast reconstruction or mastectomy. Screen-
ing mammograms which were preceded byany radiologic exam in
the prior 9 months were also excluded. In the case of multiple
exams on the same day, only the first exam in the sequence was
used in the analysis.
A linkage of 755,567 screening mammograms completed
between 2001 and 2010 to ISCR patients diagnosed with breast
cancer for diagnosis years 2001–2011 was performed. To allow 12
months of follow up for cancer diagnosis, we restricted our
analytic dataset to include bilateral screening mammograms that
were performed January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010. On the
basis of the mammograms interpretation and cancer status within
12 months of the screen, screening mammograms were defined as
true positive (TP), true negative (TN), FP, and false negative (FN)
screens. For these analyses, we compared the experiences of
women with FP and TN mammograms. The unit of analysis was
the screening mammogram.
A TN mammogram was defined as any mammogram with
BIRADS (1, 2, 3) and that cancer was not detected in the subse-
quent 12 months from date of screening mammogram; although
a FP mammogram was defined as any mammogram with BIRADS
(0,4,5) and that cancer was not detected in the subsequent 12
months from date of screening mammogram. The burden of FP
was defined as the number of additional imaging after a FP
mammogram and morbidity was defined as the receipt of biopsy
after a FP mammogram. Women with a TN mammogram were
assumed to have no additional work up during the follow-up
period.
Because the recommended interval for routine screening is at
least 12 months, we defined the index date (T ¼ 0) as 365 days
after the index screening date. Therefore, any index screening
mammograms that were followed with a subsequent screening
mammogram prior to 12 months were excluded (N ¼ 14,417,
1.9%). Follow-up period was defined as the number of months
between the index date and the date of the subsequent screening
mammogram or 36 months, whichever came first. Women who
did not return to screening at our network were considered right
censored and their follow-up time was estimated as the difference
between index date and December 31, 2014. This date was used
because our data included all screening mammograms that were
performed on or before December 31, 2014. The dependent
variable for the primary analysis was the number of months
(T) after index date for both TN and FP mammograms (Fig. 1).
In an additional analysis, we adjusted the follow-up time to
account for the time required to resolve a positive mammogram
by setting the index date to be the date of the last diagnostic
procedure related to the index mammogram on file.
For the primary objective, we excluded exams from women
who were diagnosed with breast cancer at any point during our
study period. For the secondary analysis in which we examined
the impact of FP on stage at diagnosis, we excluded screens that
were followed with a breast cancer diagnosis in the subsequent 12
months as well as cancers that were diagnosed more than 48
months from screening mammogram. The dependent variable
was late stage at diagnosis which was defined according to the
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and categorized as
late stage (stage 2, 3, 4) vs. early stage at diagnosis (stage 0 or 1).
Patient characteristics by mammogram result (TN vs. FP) and
by stage at diagnosis were tabulated. The Kaplan–Meier (product
limit) estimator was used to estimate the overall unadjusted delay
in return to screening by mammogram result (TN vs. FP), and log-
rank tests were used to compare the differences between the two
curves. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the
hazard ratio (HR) for delay in the receipt of subsequent screening
mammogram within the next 36 months from the index mam-
mogram date. Women who did not return to screening at this
network were right censored as well as women who returned to
screening after 36 months from index mammogram date. In
addition to mammogram result (TN vs. FP), the model included
variables for age, race/ethnicity, family history of breast cancer,
mammographic breast density, parity, prior history of biopsy,
time since last screening mammogram, calendar year, availability
of comparison film and facility. Stratum-specific HRs were gen-
erated using the same model as above with the addition of each
individual product term between the index mammogram result
and the variable of interest. Similar results were observed when

 using the proportional hazards model with an independent
working assumption and robust sandwich covariance matrix
estimate to account for the intracluster dependence. Therefore,
the proportional hazards model without clustering was used.
In addition to multivariable models described above, a pro-
pensity score matching technique was used to match on the
probability of a FP result. Logistic regression modeling was used
to predict the probability of being FP versus TN adjusting for
decade of age, race/ethnicity, family history of breast cancer,
mammographic breast density, parity, prior history of biopsy,
time since last screening mammogram, calendar year, availability
of comparison film at interpretation, facility, and any possible
interaction terms that were significant at an alpha 0.05 level. Off
support probabilities were excluded and greedy matching algo-
rithm without replacement was used to match 1-1 TN and FP
mammograms (24). The matched dataset was then analyzed
using Kaplan–Meier estimator to estimate the probability of
returning to screening by index mammogram result. Proportional
hazards modeling was used to estimate the risk of not returning to
recommended screening by index mammogram result.
To estimate the probability of late stage at diagnosis following a
FP or TN screening mammogram, logistic regression with gener-
alized estimating equations (GEE) was utilized to account for
clustering of screening mammograms within patients. All analy-
ses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc.) All
P values are two-sided.
IRB statement
The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review boards at all participating institutions including the Uni-
versity of Illinois Chicago and Advocate Health Care facilities and
departments.
Results
A total of 741,150 screening mammograms (FP ¼ 90,918, TN ¼
650,232) from 261,767 women were included in this study. The
overall FP rate was 12.3%. Women experiencing a FP result were
less likely to have a subsequent screen in the database than
women experiencing a TN result (22.1% vs. 15.0%, P < 0.001).
Women who did not return for screening at these facilities may
have forgone screening altogether (a substantively important
result of this study) or may have sought subsequent screening
elsewhere (may have been lost to follow-up). Women with FP
mammograms were younger, premenopausal, and were more
likely to be experiencing their first mammogram screening. Also,
they were more likely to be nH black, have denser breasts, and
were less likely to have a comparison film available at interpre-
tation (Table 1).
Regardless of index screen result, younger and premenopausal
women as well as women who were obtaining their first screening
mammogram or whose prior mammogram occurred more than
30 months before the index screen were more likely to delay their
subsequent screening (Table 2). The median delay in return to
screening was higher for FP than for TN mammograms (13
months vs. 3 months, P < 0.001; Fig. 2). Delays in returning for
subsequent screening were consistently longer after a FP mam-
mogram than after a TN mammogram across strata of patient
characteristics (Table 2).
In the adjusted proportional hazards model, women with TN
result were 36% more likely to return to screening in the next 36
months compared with women with a FP result HR ¼ 1.36 (95%
CI, 1.35–1.37). In addition, a FP result was consistently associated
with delays in subsequent screening within strata of patient
characteristics and screening history (Table 3).
To examine whether the classification of 10,746 (1.45%)
screening mammograms with BIRADS 3 as TN impacted our
results we performed sensitivity analyses in which we (i) excluded
screens with BIRADS 3 or (ii) included BIRADS as FP mammo-
grams. The results in both scenarios were nearly identical to those
reported when we classified mammograms with BIRADS 3 as TN.
The results after resetting the index date to account for the time
required to resolve a FP mammogram were similar to the results
that were observed when using the actual mammogram date as
the index date. Briefly, the median delay in return to screening was
higher for FP than for TN mammograms (12 months vs. 3
months, P < 0.001). Delays in returning for subsequent screening
were consistently longer after a FP mammogram than after a TN
mammogram across strata of patient characteristics. In the adjust-
ed proportional hazards model, women with TN result were 36%
more likely to return to screening compared with women with a
FP result HR ¼ 1.36 (95% CI, 1.36–1.39; data not shown).
Compared with women who did not receive additional work
up, women who received additional imaging were 24% less likely
to return to screening HR ¼ 0.76 (95% CI, 0.758–0.772), and
women who received imaging and biopsy were 34% less likely to

 return to screening HR ¼ 0.66 (95% CI, 0.64–0.67; Ptrend <0.001).
Among FPs only, women who experienced additional imaging
and biopsy were 19% less likely to return to screening compared
with women who received imaging only HR ¼ 1.19 (95% CI,
1.15–1.22).
We re-analyzed our primary results using propensity score
matching. We matched 90,095 (99.1% of all FPs in the dataset)
FP index mammograms to a similar number of true negative
mammograms. The proportion of women who did not return to
screening was slightly higher among women who experienced a
FP mammogram compared with women with a TN exam (22.1%
vs. 19.2%, P <0.001). The two cohorts were balanced in terms of
women's characteristics. Similar to the analysis which included all
exams, delay in return to subsequent mammograms was longer
among women with FP compared with women with TN mam-
mograms. The median delay was 13 months among FP compared
with 6 months among TN (P <0.001). After adjusting for patient
characteristics, the chance of returning with screening was 34%
higher in women with TN exams compared with women with FP
mammograms HR ¼ 1.33 (95% CI, 1.32–1.35).
For the 751,347 screening mammograms defined as either false
positive or true negative, 4-year cumulative risk of a late stage at
diagnosis was found to be higher following a FP mammogram
compared with a TN mammogram (0.4% vs. 0.3%, for FP vs. TN
respectively, P ¼ 0.001, results not tabulated). Similar results were
observed when adjusting for patient and clinical factors as well as
clustering within patients such that the risk of late stage at
diagnosis was 20% higher in FP compared with TN (P <
0.001). Similarly, delays in returning to subsequent screening
also increased the risk of late stage at diagnosis such that the risk
increases by 0.3% for every one additional month delay
(P < 0.001, data not shown).
Discussion
We sought to examine how the experience of a FP mammogram
might impact adherence to subsequent mammography screening
in a large cohort of women from a single healthcare organization.
Our results suggest that women who had a FP mammogram were
less likely to return for screening within the following 36 months
compared with those with TN mammogram results. This finding
is consistent with another U.S.-based study that used secondary
data from telephone interviews and medical claims records for
calendar years 2005–2008 on 2,406 women which were followed
for 36 months. This study found that 22.1% of women with FP
mammogram compared with 15% of women with TN mammo-
gram delayed their receipt of the subsequent screening (25).
Conversely, studies conducted more than a decade ago using
data from the 1990s found that women who experienced FP
mammogram had better adherence to subsequent screening
compared with women with a true negative mammogram exam
outcome (11, 12, 26).
Several other studies from Europe and Canada found no dif-
ference in re-screening (13–16, 27), and yet others have reported
lower re-screening rates among FPs than among TNs (18–20, 28–
30). These inconsistent results suggest both secular and geographic
variation in the impact of FP mammography on adherence to
screening recommendations amongthe UnitedStates, Europe,and
Canada (21). The conflicting results for international comparisons
may be attributed to variations in screening practices such as
screening intervals are shorter in the United States than in Europe,
greater emphasis on accuracy in Europe by double readings which
have been reported to result in 3%–5% lowerrecall rates compared
with the United States, and differences in national mammography
programs for Europe and U.S. public and private screening pro-
viders. The inconsistency between the majority of the U.S. studies
and our study might be explained by secular changes in how
women perceive and adapt to a FP mammogram, which may be
related to changes in guidelines (USPSTF guidelines 2002 and
2009) and increased awareness of the balance of benefits and
harms of mammography screening over the last decade.
Our study findings suggest that the delay in returning to
recommended mammography screening practices increased the
risk of subsequent diagnoses with late-stage breast cancer. A
similar observation was reported from a study in the United
Kingdom, which found an increased likelihood of late stage at
diagnosis among women with FP compared with those with TN
mammogram results OR ¼ 1.37 (95% CI, 0.67–2.28; ref. 20).

 Some women who experience a FP result might decide to get
their next screening mammogram 12 months after the comple-
tion of their diagnostic work-up, rather than 12 months after their
last screen. When we adjusted the follow-up time for women with
a FP screen to begin at the date of the last diagnostic procedure,
our results were similar to the results generated when using the
screening mammogram date as the index date. Thus, the potential
for a perceived shift in the appropriate date for the next screen
among women with a FP index mammogram could not account
for the association of a FP result with delayed subsequent
screening.
Strengths of this study include the availability of screening
and diagnostic records of prior exams that were conducted
within our network and the large number of exams from a
diverse community-based cohort. Other studies (12, 26) have
used women as the unit of analysis to estimate the probability
of returning to the subsequent screening mammography, which
may be subject to recall bias because of the possible differences
in the accuracy of the recollection of prior exams such that
women who have experienced a prior FP result may have a
better memory of their experience than women with a prior TN
exam.
This study has several limitations as well. First, we could not
account for insurance status in our analysis as these data were not
available in our data collection system. Women who are unin-
sured or underinsured may be more likely to be truly lost to
follow-up if they lack a medical insurance. Alternatively, under-
insured women may be more likely to delay or forgo altogether
subsequent screening as a result of a FP screen, perhaps due to the
concern regarding high out-of-pocket costs.
In these analyses, we included the 14% of exams that were not
followed by a subsequent screening mammogram within our
network as right censored. It is possible that these women may
have never returned to screening or could have received their
mammography screening somewhere else outside our network. It
is also possible that some women who appeared to delay their
subsequent screen may have obtained another screen elsewhere in
the interim, outside this health care organization, and thus not
captured by our radiology database. This limitation may have
impacted our results by differentially inflating the median follow

 up for FP and TN mammograms. When excluding those who did
not have a subsequent mammogram in the system, we still
observed longer median time to return to subsequent screening
in women with FP compared with their TN counterparts
(7 months vs. 2 months, P < 0.001). Similar finding was also
observed after resetting the index date to account for the time
required to resolve a FP mammogram. Given the high percentage
(86%) of index screens were associated with a subsequent screen,
loss to follow-up would appear to be modest, but this is could not
be determined empirically.
In conclusion, our study found that women who experienced
a FP mammogram were more likely to delay their subsequent
screening compared with women with a TN mammogram. The
finding is important in that women who experience a FP
mammogram result should be provided with more informa-
tion about the continued benefits of mammography screening
and encouraged to maintain adherence to screening mammog-
raphy recommendations.
