Abstract
Background: Although nut consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and
all-cause mortality, data on less common causes of death has not been systematically assessed. Previous reviews
missed several studies and additional studies have since been published. We therefore conducted a systematic
review and meta-analysis of nut consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause and
cause-specific mortality.
Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched for prospective studies of nut consumption and risk of
cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in adult populations published up to
July 19, 2016. Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects
models. The burden of mortality attributable to low nut consumption was calculated for selected regions.
Results: Twenty studies (29 publications) were included in the meta-analysis. The summary RRs per 28 grams/day
increase in nut intake was for coronary heart disease, 0.71 (95% CI: 0.63–0.80, I2 = 47%, n = 11), stroke, 0.93 (95%
CI: 0.83–1.05, I2 = 14%, n = 11), cardiovascular disease, 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70–0.88, I2 = 60%, n = 12), total cancer, 0.85
(95% CI: 0.76–0.94, I2 = 42%, n = 8), all-cause mortality, 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72–0.84, I2 = 66%, n = 15), and for mortality
from respiratory disease, 0.48 (95% CI: 0.26–0.89, I2 = 61%, n = 3), diabetes, 0.61 (95% CI: 0.43–0.88, I2 = 0%, n = 4),
neurodegenerative disease, 0.65 (95% CI: 0.40–1.08, I2 = 5.9%, n = 3), infectious disease, 0.25 (95% CI: 0.07–0.85,
I2 = 54%, n = 2), and kidney disease, 0.27 (95% CI: 0.04–1.91, I2 = 61%, n = 2). The results were similar for tree nuts
and peanuts. If the associations are causal, an estimated 4.4 million premature deaths in the America, Europe,
Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific would be attributable to a nut intake below 20 grams per day in 2013.
Conclusions: Higher nut intake is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer and all-cause
mortality, and mortality from respiratory disease, diabetes, and infections.

 Background
Cardiovascular disease and cancer remain the two most
common causes of death, accounting for 25.5 million
deaths worldwide in 2013 [1]. Epidemiological and inter-
vention studies have shown that a high intake of nuts is
associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease
and possibly other health outcomes such as diabetes,
overweight and obesity, gallstones, and colorectal cancer
[2–4]. Tree nuts, botanically defined as dry fruit contain-
ing one seed (rarely two) within the ovary wall that be-
comes hard at maturity, include walnuts, almonds,
hazelnuts, cashews, pistachios, and pecans [5]. While
Brazil nuts and peanuts are botanically classified as seeds
and legumes, respectively, all of tree nuts, Brazil nuts,
and peanuts are collectively referred to as nuts due to
their similar nutritional properties and culinary use.
Nuts are good sources of dietary fiber, magnesium, poly-
unsaturated fats, vitamin E, and antioxidants, all of
which may reduce risk of cardiovascular disease by redu-
cing insulin resistance [6], cholesterol concentrations
[4], lipid peroxidation [7], and oxidative stress [8]. Nuts
also contain other bioactive compounds, such as ellagic
acid, anacardic acid, genistein, resveratrol, and inositol
phosphates, which may reduce cancer risk by inducing
cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, inhibiting cell proliferation,
migration, invasion, and angiogenesis [9]. However,
epidemiological data on nuts and cancer risk are less
extensive than for cardiovascular disease.
There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a role
of nut consumption in reducing risk of coronary heart
disease [2, 10–17] and mortality [10, 12–16, 18–22].
However, whether a high intake of nuts is associated
with risk of stroke [13–15, 23–27] or overall cancer risk
[13–15, 21, 24, 28] is not clear, as most studies reported
no significant association [13–15, 21, 23, 25–27] and only
a few reported significant inverse associations [14, 16, 21].
Nevertheless, the possibility that a weak association may
have been missed because of low statistical power cannot
be excluded. Although a few previous reviews reported a
reduced risk of coronary heart disease and mortality
[29–31]
with
higher
nut
intake,
associations
with
stroke have been unclear, with one meta-analysis finding
no statistically significant association [32], but another
meta-analysis reporting a significant inverse association
[33]. However, in the latter, the Nurses’ Health Study and
the Health Professionals Follow-up Study had been in-
cluded twice, thus, questions remain with regards to
whether there is an association between nut intake and
stroke. In addition, several large cohort studies including
47,061 deaths and > 748,000 additional participants were
either not included [20, 28] or have been published
[14, 15, 22, 34–37] since these reviews, and more de-
tailed and updated analyses have since been published
from
the
Physicians’
Health
Study
[15]
and
the
Netherlands Cohort Study [16]. Associations between
nut consumption and less common causes of death
have not been systematically assessed. Therefore, we con-
ducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective
studies of nut consumption and the risk of coronary heart
disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-
cause mortality as well as less common causes of death to
provide a more up-to-date and comprehensive assessment
of the available evidence. We aimed to clarify the strength
and shape of the dose–response relationship between nut
consumption and these outcomes, identify potential differ-
ences by type of nuts consumed (total nuts, tree nuts, pea-
nuts), as well as potential sources of heterogeneity between
studies by geographic location. To examine the health im-
pact of low nut consumption we also estimated the number
of deaths in North and South America, Europe, Southeast
Asia, and the Western Pacific attributable to low nut con-
sumption based on regional studies [14, 38–44] and data
on mortality from the Global Burden of Disease Study [1].
Methods
Search strategy and inclusion criteria
The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched
from their inception (1966 and 1947, respectively) to
July 19, 2016. The search terms used for the PubMed
search are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1 and a
similar search was conducted in EMBASE. Published
prospective studies (cohort studies, case-cohort studies,
nested case–control studies within cohort studies, and
randomized trials) of nut intake (any type of edible nut
consumption, including all dosages) among mainly adult
populations and incidence or mortality from coronary
heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, total cancer,
and all-cause (primary outcomes) and cause-specific
mortality (secondary outcomes) from any cause of death
investigated by at least two studies were included if they
reported adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). For the dose–response ana-
lyses, a quantitative measure of the intake for at least
three categories of nut intake or a risk estimate on a
continuous scale had to be available. Retrospective case–
control studies were excluded because of the greater po-
tential for recall and selection bias, while cross-sectional
studies were excluded because of the difficulty of drawing
conclusions with regard to the cause and effect. Reviews,
meta-analyses, duplicate publications, studies with an un-
specific exposure (e.g., nut intake was combined with
fruits or legumes), studies on other outcomes, studies that
did not report adjusted risk estimates, ecological studies,
letters, and studies with unusable data, as well as ab-
stracts, grey literature, and unpublished studies, were not
included. When duplicate publications were published
from the same studies we chose the publication with the
largest number of cases or deaths for inclusion. We
Aune et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:207 
Page 2 of 14
 searched the references of the retrieved reports for any
additional studies. The first author of one study [20] was
contacted to obtain information with regard to the
amount of nut intake for each category of intake and this
information was provided. DA conducted the literature
search and the screening of the studies and TN screened
in duplicate the 89 potentially relevant studies identified
from the initial screening (Fig. 1). Any discrepancies were
resolved by discussion. Study quality was assessed by two
authors (DA, DCG) using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale,
which awards a score of 0–9 based on the selection, com-
parability, and outcome assessment [45]. We considered
studies with a score of 0–3, 4–6, and 7–9 to represent
low, medium, and high quality studies, respectively. We
followed the PRISMA criteria for reporting of meta-
analyses of observational studies [46]. A list of the ex-
cluded studies is provided in Additional file 1: Table S2.
Although there was no protocol for the current review, we
followed standard methods and analytic approaches simi-
lar to our previous meta-analysis [47].
Data extraction
The following data from the studies were extracted into
tables: name of first author, publication year, country or
region, the name of the study, follow-up period, sample
size and number of cases or deaths, type of outcome,
gender, age, type of nuts (total nuts, tree nuts, walnuts,
peanuts, peanut butter), amount or frequency of intake,
RRs and 95% CIs, and variables adjusted for in the analysis.
DA conducted the data extraction which was checked for
accuracy by NK.
Statistical methods
Summary RRs and 95% CIs of cardiovascular disease,
total cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality
for the highest versus the lowest level and per one serv-
ing per day increase in nut intake were calculated using
the random effects model [48], which takes into account
both within and between study variation (heterogeneity).
The RR from each study was weighted by the method of
DerSimonian and Laird [48] and the average of the nat-
ural logarithm of the RRs was estimated. When data
were reported separately by sex or other subgroups we
pooled the RRs using a fixed effects model before inclu-
sion in the overall meta-analysis. A two-tailed P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Linear dose–response analyses were conducted using
the method by Greenland and Longnecker [49] and we
computed study-specific slopes (linear trends) and 95%
CIs from the natural logarithm of the RRs across cat-
egories of nut intake. A serving size of nuts was defined
as one ounce or 28 grams [12, 13, 21], and serving sizes
were converted accordingly unless authors specified an-
other serving size. The mean or median level of nut in-
take was used if reported in the paper, and for studies
that reported nut intake by ranges of intake we esti-
mated the midpoint of the upper and lower bound.
When extreme categories were open-ended or had ex-
treme upper or lower values, we used the width of the
adjacent interval to calculate an upper or lower cut-off
value. Potential nonlinear dose–response relationships
between nut intake and cardiovascular disease, cancer,
and mortality were assessed using restricted
cubic
splines, with three knots at 10%, 50%, and 90% percen-
tiles of the distribution, which were combined using
multivariate meta-analysis [50, 51]. We tested for non-
linearity by using a likelihood ratio test to assess the dif-
ference between the nonlinear and linear models [52].
Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Q and
I2 statistics [53]. A P < 0.10 was considered to be statisti-
cally significant for the Q statistic. I2 is the proportion of
total variation that is explained by between-study variation.
Sources of heterogeneity were investigated in subgroup
analyses stratified by sex, duration of follow-up, geographic
location, number of cases/deaths, study quality score,
and adjustment for confounding factors (age, educa-
tion, family history of cardiovascular disease, body
mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol, physical activity,

 hypertension, hypercholesterolemia/serum cholesterol,
coffee/caffeine, sugar-sweetened beverages, red and/or
processed meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, whole grains,
dairy products, and energy intake). Small study effects,
such as publication bias, were assessed using Egger’s test
[54] and by inspection of funnel plots. Stata version 12.0
software (StataCorp, Texas, US) was used for the analyses.
Population-attributable risk
In a secondary analysis, we estimated the number of
deaths from all causes and specific causes that could po-
tentially be avoided, assuming a causal relationship be-
tween nut intake and mortality in Europe, North and
South America, and Southeast Asia and Western Pacific,
using data on nut intake from cohort studies and dietary
surveys in these regions [14, 38–44], data on mortality
from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 [1], and
the summary RRs from the nonlinear dose–response
meta-analysis of mortality from coronary heart disease,
total cancer, all causes, respiratory disease, and diabetes.
The formula by Miettinen [55] was used to calculate the
population-attributable risk of mortality due to low nut
consumption: PAR = p(rr–1)/(1 + p(rr–1)), where p is the
prevalence of the exposure in the population, and rr is
the relative risk. Because there was evidence of nonline-
arity between nut consumption and mortality and most
specific causes of death we used the relative risk esti-
mates derived from the nonlinear analyses. We used 20
grams per day as the optimal intake, because there was
little evidence of further reductions in risk above this level
of intake in the current meta-analysis. The prevalence of
nut intake was calculated in increments of 10 grams per
day (0, > 0 to < 10, 10 to < 20, compared to ≥ 20 (refer-
ence)), and we used the relative risk at zero intake and at
the midpoint of each category (0, 5, 15, compared to ≥ 20).
Because all the epidemiological studies included in this
meta-analysis have been conducted in mainly adult popu-
lations we excluded the number of deaths occurring be-
fore 15 years of age.
Results
Out of a total of 48,380 records identified by the search,
1337 were given detailed assessment, and 89 of these
reporting on nut intake were considered potentially eli-
gible for inclusion. Twenty prospective cohort studies
(29 publications) [2, 10–28, 34–37, 56–60] (some studies
had more than one publication, but reported on different
outcomes in each included publication) were included in
the analysis of nut intake and coronary heart disease,
stroke, cardiovascular disease, total cancer, all-cause mor-
tality, and other causes of mortality (Additional file 1:
Table S3–S13). For inflammatory disease mortality, there
was only one study [60] so it was not possible to conduct
a meta-analysis, but the results are reviewed in Additional
file 1: Table S13. No additional studies were identified by
scanning the reference lists of the included studies and
previous reviews. The dose-response analyses of nut in-
take included 12,331 coronary heart disease cases, 9272
stroke cases, 18,655 cardiovascular disease cases, 18,490
cancer cases, and 85,870 deaths among up to 819,448
participants. Nine studies were from the US, six from
Europe, four from Asia, and one from Australia. All
studies
were
among
mainly
adult
populations,
although one study had an age range of 16–79 years
[10]. Three studies were among men only, five among
women only, and 12 in both sexes. A summary of the
study characteristics of the included studies is provided in
Additional file 1: Table S3–S13. Figure 1 shows a
flow-chart of the study selection. Figures 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6 shows the results of the dose–response analyses
and Additional file 1: Figure S1–S10 shows the results
from the high versus low analyses. Results for specific
tree nuts, peanuts, and peanut butter are provided in
Table 1 and Additional file 1: Figure S11–S69.
Nuts and coronary heart disease
Twelve cohort studies (11 publications) [2, 10–14, 16,
34–36, 56] investigated the association between nut intake
and coronary heart disease risk and the dose-response
analysis included a total of 12,331 cases and 315,397
participants. One publication was only included in the
subgroup analysis of coronary heart disease incidence
[17], while another publication was only included in the
subgroup analysis of coronary heart disease mortality
[15]. The summary RR for high versus low intake was
0.76 (95% CI: 0.69–0.84, I2 = 42%, Pheterogeneity = 0.06)
(Additional file 1: Figure S1). The summary RR for a one
serving per day increment was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.63–0.80,
I2 = 47%, Pheterogeneity = 0.04) (Fig. 2a, Table 1). There was
no evidence of small study bias with Egger’s test, P = 0.28.
There was evidence of a nonlinear association between
nut intake and coronary heart disease, Pnonlinearity < 0.0001,
with only slight further reductions in risk above 15–20
grams per day (Fig. 2b, Additional file 1: Table S14).
The summary RR for high versus low intake of tree nuts
was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.68–0.92, I2 = 28%, Pheterogeneity = 0.25,
n = 3) [13, 16] and peanuts was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69–0.82,
I2 = 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.65, n = 5) [13, 14, 16] and the
respective summary RRs per 10 grams/day increase in intake
were 0.73 (95% CI: 0.63–0.85, I2 = 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.44,
n = 3) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.57–0.84, I2 = 45%, Pheterogeneity =
0.12, n = 5) (Additional file 1: Figure S11–S16, Table 1).
Nuts and stroke
Eleven cohort studies (10 publications) [14–16, 23, 25–27,
34–36, 57] were included in the analysis of nut intake
and risk of stroke and the dose-response analysis
included a total of 9272 cases and 396,768 participants.

 The summary RR for high versus low intake was 0.89
(95% CI: 0.82–0.97, I2 = 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.90) (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S2). The summary RR per one
serving per day was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.83–1.05, I2 = 14%,
Pheterogeneity = 0.31) (Fig. 2c, Table 1). There was no evi-
dence of small study bias with Egger’s test (P = 0.30).
There was evidence of a nonlinear association between
nut intake and stroke risk, Pnonlinearity < 0.0001, with a
slight J-shaped curve with reductions in risk observed
up to approximately 10–15 grams per day, but a
slight positive association at intakes of 30 grams per
day, however, this was not observed when studies
were stratified by whether the outcome was stroke
incidence or stroke mortality (Fig. 2d, Additional file 1:
Table S14).
The summary RR for high versus low intake of tree
nuts was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.77–1.13, I2 = 0%, Pheterogeneity =
0.44, n = 3) [13, 16] and of peanuts was 0.83 (95% CI:
0.69–1.00, I2 = 46%, Pheterogeneity = 0.12, n = 5) [13, 14, 16]
and the respective summary RRs per 10 grams/day in-
crease in intake were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.69–1.14, I2 = 0%,
Pheterogeneity = 0.58, n = 3) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.41–0.95,
I2 = 78%, Pheterogeneity = 0.001, n = 5) (Additional file 1:
Figure S17–S22, Table 1).
Nuts and cardiovascular disease
Twelve cohort studies (11 publications) [12–16, 21, 28,
34–37, 58] investigated nut intake and cardiovascular
disease risk and the dose-response analysis included a
total of 18,655 cases and 376,228 participants. One publi-
cation was included in the subgroup analysis of cardiovas-
cular disease incidence only [59]. The summary RR for
high versus low intake was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74–0.89, I2 =
52%, Pheterogeneity = 0.02) (Additional file 1: Figure S3). The
summary RR was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70–0.88, I2 = 60%, Pheter-
ogeneity = 0.004) per one serving per day (Fig. 3a). There
was some suggestion of small study bias with Egger’s test
(P = 0.07), but this was explained by one small study [21]
and, when excluded, Egger’s test showed P = 0.16, and the
summary estimate was not materially altered (summary
RR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.72–0.89, I2 = 56%, Pheterogeneity =
0.01). There was evidence of a nonlinear association be-
tween nut intake and cardiovascular disease risk (Pnonlinear-
ity = 0.001), with a reduction in risk observed up to an
intake of approximately 15 g/d, but no further reductions
with higher intakes (Fig. 3b, Additional file 1: Table S14).
The summary RR for high versus low intake of tree nuts
was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69–0.84, I2 = 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.92, n
= 3) [13, 16] and peanuts was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70–0.81, I2
= 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.90, n = 5) [13, 14, 16] and the
respective summary RRs per 10 grams/day increase in in-
take were 0.75 (95% CI: 0.67–0.84, I2 = 0%, Pheterogeneity =
0.84, n = 3) and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.50–0.81, I2 = 77%, Phe-
terogeneity = 0.001, n = 5) (Additional file 1: Figure S23–
S28, Table 1).
Nuts and total cancer
Nine cohort studies (8 publications) [13–16, 21, 28, 35,
37] were included in the analysis of nut intake and total
cancer risk and the dose-response analysis included
18,490 cancer cases among 304,285 participants. The
summary RR for the high versus low intake was 0.82
(95% CI: 0.74–0.89, I2 = 28%, Pheterogeneity = 0.21) (Add-
itional file 1: Figure S4). The summary RR per one serv-
ing per day was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.76–0.94, I2 = 42%,
Pheterogeneity = 0.10) (Fig. 3c, Table 1). Egger’s test for
small study bias was not significant (P = 0.10). There
was no evidence of a nonlinear association between
nut intake and total cancer (Pnonlinearity = 0.11) (Fig. 3d,
Additional file 1: Table S15).
The summary RR for high versus low intake of tree nuts
was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76–0.90, I2 = 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.98, n
= 3) [13, 16] and peanuts was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87–0.99, I2
= 19%, Pheterogeneity = 0.30, n = 5) [13, 14, 16], and the
respective summary RRs per 10 grams/day increase in
intake
were
0.80

Nuts and all-cause mortality
Fifteen cohort studies (15 publications, 16 risk estimates)
[10, 12–16, 18–22, 34–37] were included in the analysis
of nut intake and all-cause mortality and the dose-re-
sponse analysis included 85,870 deaths and 819,448 par-
ticipants. The summary RR for high versus low intake
was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77–0.85, I2 = 41%, Pheterogeneity =
0.05) (Additional file 1: Figure S5). The summary RR
was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72–0.84, I2 = 66%, Pheterogeneity <
0.0001) per one serving per day (Fig. 4a, Table 1). There
was suggestion of small study bias with Egger’s test (P =
0.02) (Additional file 1: Figure S35); however, after ex-
cluding five studies with less than 500 deaths [10, 18, 21,
22, 35], Egger’s test was no longer significant (P = 0.25),
and there was no asymmetry in the funnel plot, while as-
sociation remained similar (summary RR = 0.80; 95% CI:

 0.74–0.87). There was evidence of a nonlinear association
between
nut
consumption
and
all-cause
mortality
(Pnonlinearity < 0.0001), with a steeper reduction in risk at
lower intakes, and no further reduction in risk above 15–20
grams per day (Fig. 4b, Additional file 1: Table S15).
The summary RR for high versus low intake of tree nuts
was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.74–0.86, I2 = 58%, Pheterogeneity = 0.07,
n = 4) [13, 14, 16], that of peanuts was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81–
0.89, I2 = 34%, Pheterogeneity = 0.19, n = 5) [13, 14, 16], and
that of peanut butter was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80–0.99, I2 =
31%, Pheterogeneity = 0.23, n = 2) [14, 16], and the respective
summary RRs per 10 grams/day increase in intake were
0.82 (95% CI: 0.75–0.90, I2 = 70%, Pheterogeneity = 0.02, n
= 3), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.69–0.86, I2 = 64%, Pheterogeneity = 0.03,
n = 5), and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.86–1.02, I2 = 0%, Phetero-
geneity = 0.76, n = 2), respectively (Additional file 1: Figure
S36–S43, Table 1).
Nuts and other causes of mortality
The summary RR for high versus low intake was 0.76
(95% CI: 0.61–0.94, I2 = 54%, Pheterogeneity = 0.11, n = 3
studies, 2551 deaths, 122,164 participants) for respira-
tory disease mortality (Additional file 1: Figure S6), 0.68
(95% CI: 0.52–0.90, I2 = 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.59, n = 4,
800 deaths, 193,928 participants) for diabetes mortality
(Additional file 1: Figure S7), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.72–1.21, I2
= 53%, Pheterogeneity = 0.12, n = 3, 2056 deaths, 122,164
participants) for neurodegenerative disease mortality
(Additional file 1: Figure S8), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.56–1.11, I2
= 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.49, n = 2397 deaths, 118,962 partic-
ipants) for infectious disease mortality (Additional file 1:
Figure S9), and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.38–1.25, I2 = 69%, Phetero-
geneity = 0.07, n = 2367 deaths, 118,962 participants) for
kidney disease mortality (Additional file 1: Figure S10).
The respective summary RRs per one serving per day in-
crease in nut intake was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.26–0.89, I2 =
61%, Pheterogeneity = 0.08, n = 3), 0.61 (95% CI: 0.43–0.88, I2
= 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.76, n = 4), 0.65 (95% CI: 0.40–1.08,
I2 = 5.9%, Pheterogeneity = 0.35, n = 3), 0.25 (95% CI: 0.07–
0.85, I2 = 0%, Pheterogeneity = 0.74, n = 2), and 0.27 (95% CI:
0.04–1.91, I2 = 61%, Pheterogeneity = 0.11, n = 2) (Figs. 5 and
6, Additional file 1: Table S15). Results for subtypes of
nuts in relation to other causes of mortality were in gen-
eral similar to the overall results (Table 1, Additional file
1: Figure S44–S69). Only one study reported on nut intake
and inflammatory disease mortality and reported a re-
duced risk with higher intake of nuts; however, it was not
possible to conduct a meta-analysis for this outcome
(Additional file 1: Table S13).
Subgroup and meta-regression analyses, study quality,
and sensitivity analyses
In subgroup and meta-regression analyses there was little
evidence
of
heterogeneity
between
subgroups
when
analyses were stratified by study characteristics including
duration of follow-up, sex, geographic location, number of
cases or deaths, study quality scores, and adjustment for
potential confounding factors (Additional file 1: Table S16
and S17). There was indication of a stronger association
between nut intake and cardiovascular disease among men
than among women (Pheterogeneity = 0.02) (Additional file 1:
Table S16); however, there was no evidence of a difference
of the other associations by sex. There was also heterogen-
eity in the analysis of nuts and cardiovascular disease when
stratified by adjustment for smoking (Pheterogeneity = 0.02),
hypertension (Pheterogeneity = 0.007), and whole grains (Phe-
terogeneity = 0.01), with stronger associations among studies
with adjustment for smoking and hypertension than
among studies without such adjustment, and a weaker
association among studies with adjustment for whole
grains than without such adjustment. For all-cause
mortality there was evidence of a weaker association
among studies with a longer duration of follow-up
compared to studies with a shorter duration of follow-up
(Pheterogeneity = 0.03).
Mean (median) study quality scores were 7.4 (8.0) for
coronary heart disease, 7.7 (8.0) for stroke, 7.6 (8.0) for car-
diovascular disease, 8.0 (8.0) for total cancer, and 7.3 (7.5)
for all-cause mortality (Additional file 1: Table S18–S22).
With regard to the study quality score some parts of
the score more often gave zero points than others
including representativeness of the cohort, exposure
ascertainment (lack of interview or lack of validated
FFQ),
demonstration
that
the
outcome
was
not
present at the beginning of the study (no exclusion of
prevalent cases), and adequacy of follow-up (loss to
follow-up of more than 10% or not stated), while the
parts of the score that covered the selection of the
non-exposed cohort, adjustment for confounding fac-
tors, assessment of the outcome, and having a long
enough follow-up for cases to accrue, appeared to be met
across studies.
In sensitivity analyses excluding one study at a time
from the analysis the results were robust to the influence
of individual studies in the analysis of coronary heart
disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and
mortality (Additional file 1: Figure S70–S74).
Population-attributable risk
Under the assumption that the associations observed be-
tween nut consumption and mortality are causal, we esti-
mated that a
total of 4.4 million deaths may
be
attributable to a nut intake of less than 20 grams per day
in 2013 in the regions covered (Additional file 1: Table
S23). Of specific causes of death we estimated 1.19 million
deaths due to coronary heart disease, 469,000 deaths due
to cancer, 1.07 million deaths due to respiratory disease,
and 139,000 deaths due to diabetes may be attributable to
Aune et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:207 
Page 9 of 14
 a nut intake below 20 grams per day in 2013 in the same
regions (Additional file 1: Table S23).
Discussion
In this meta-analysis there was a 24%, 11%, 19%, 18%,
and 19% reduction in the relative risk of coronary heart
disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and
all-cause mortality with a higher nut intake, respectively.
In the dose–response analysis there was a 29%, 7%, 21%,
15%, and 22% reduction in the relative risk for a one serv-
ing per day increase in nut intake (one serving = 28
grams), respectively, although the association for stroke
was not statistically significant in the linear dose–response
analysis. There was evidence of a nonlinear association be-
tween nut intake and coronary heart disease, stroke, car-
diovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause mortality,
with most of the reduction in risk observed up to an in-
take of approximately 15–20 grams per day or 5–6 serv-
ings per week for most of the outcomes. In addition, there
was a 52%, 39%, and 75% reduction in the relative risk of
respiratory disease, diabetes, and infectious disease mor-
tality, respectively, for a one serving per day increase in in-
take, and non-significant inverse associations were also
observed for neurodegenerative disease mortality and kid-
ney disease mortality, although the number of studies was
low. The intake of both peanuts and tree nuts was associ-
ated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, cardio-
vascular disease, and mortality; however, only the intake of
peanuts was associated with reduced risk of stroke, while
the intake of tree nuts was associated with reduced cancer
risk. Inverse associations were observed in European and
American studies as well as in Asian studies of peanuts.
Intake of peanut butter was inversely associated with mor-
tality in the high versus low analysis, but not in the dose–
response analysis. Although it is possible that the added
sugar or salt in peanut butter could counteract any benefi-
cial effects of plain peanuts, the limited number of studies
makes the interpretation of those results difficult.
Under the assumption that the observed associations
are causal we estimated that approximately 4.4 million
premature deaths in the regions covered, including
North and South America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and
Western Pacific, may be attributable to a nut intake
below 20 grams per day. For specific causes of death, we
estimated that 1.19 million deaths due to coronary heart
disease, 469,000 due to cancer, 1.07 million due to re-
spiratory disease, and 138,000 due to diabetes may be
caused by a nut intake below 20 grams per day. How-
ever, the appropriateness of these estimates is dependent
on the validity of several assumptions, including that of
(1) a causal relationship between nut consumption and
these outcomes, (2) lack of confounding and measurement
error in explaining the results, and (3) the generalizability
of the results to the regions covered.
Our meta-analysis provides the most up-to-date sum-
mary estimates of the association between nut consump-
tion and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause and
cause-specific mortality and is consistent with previous re-
views and meta-analyses that have been published on the
topic [29, 31, 61]. Nevertheless, the current meta-analysis
contains 1.5–3 times the number of studies compared to
the previously published meta-analyses and approximately
twice the number of all-cause deaths. For example, in the
dose–response analysis of nut intake and all-cause mortal-
ity we included 15 studies (85,870 deaths), compared to 5
studies (48,818 deaths) [29], 7 studies (44,636 deaths) [31],
and 10 studies (49,232 deaths) in previous meta-analyses
[61]. In the dose–response analysis of coronary heart dis-
ease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and total cancer, we
included 11, 11, 12, and 8 studies, respectively, compared
to 6 and 4 studies for coronary heart disease and stroke in
one meta-analysis [30], 7 and 4 studies on coronary heart
disease and stroke in another meta-analysis [62], 5 and 3
studies for cardiovascular and cancer mortality in a third
meta-analysis [31], and 4 studies on cancer mortality in a
fourth meta-analysis [16]. In addition, we found inverse
associations between nut consumption and mortality from
respiratory disease, diabetes, and infections, although the
number of studies in these analyses was low and further
studies are needed to confirm these findings.
Some potential limitations of our meta-analysis should
be mentioned. There was high heterogeneity in the ana-
lysis of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.
Some heterogeneity is expected because of differences in
the age groups included, geographic location, detail of
the dietary assessment, factors adjusted for in the ana-
lyses, types of nuts consumed, as well as the distribution
of specific causes of death and cancers that contribute to
all-cause mortality and total cancer. For cardiovascular
disease and all-cause mortality, the heterogeneity was
driven more by differences in the strength of the associa-
tions than differences in the direction of the association.
In the analysis of cardiovascular disease, there was
between-subgroup heterogeneity when stratified by sex,
with a stronger inverse association among men than
women
and
no
heterogeneity
within
subgroups.
However, associations for coronary heart disease and
stroke were similar when stratified by sex, thus we
cannot exclude the possibility that chance could explain
this sex difference for cardiovascular disease. There was
also heterogeneity when stratified by adjustment for
smoking, hypertension, and whole grains, with stronger
associations in studies with adjustment for smoking and
hypertension than in studies without such adjustment
and a weaker association among studies with adjustment
for whole grains than in studies without. In the analysis
of
all-cause
mortality
there
was
little
evidence
of
heterogeneity between subgroups, with the exception of
Aune et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:207 
Page 10 of 14
 a slightly weaker association among studies with a lon-
ger compared to a shorter duration of follow-up. There
was no evidence of heterogeneity in the analysis of
stroke and total cancer, and moderate heterogeneity in
the analysis of coronary heart disease. There was no evi-
dence of heterogeneity when analyses were stratified by
geographic location. Although there were some differ-
ences among the included studies with regard to the
amounts and ranges of nut intake, this was taken into
account in the dose–response analyses. Subjects with a
high intake of nuts tend to be less likely to smoke, to be
slimmer and more physically active, and to have a lower
intake of red and processed meat and a higher intake of
fruits and vegetables than persons with a low nut intake
[13], thus confounding by other lifestyle and dietary fac-
tors is a potential source of bias. However, in subgroup
analyses we found that the associations observed per-
sisted among studies which adjusted for smoking, alco-
hol, physical activity, BMI, and dietary factors such as
red meat and fruit and vegetables. In addition, in the
Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals
Follow-up
Study
the
inverse
associations
persisted
when analyses were stratified by these and other po-
tential confounding factors [13]. Measurement errors
may have affected the findings, but none of the in-
cluded
studies
made
corrections
for
measurement
error; however, because of the prospective design of
the included studies such errors would most likely at-
tenuate the strength of the observed associations [63].
There was a limited number of studies in the analyses of
mortality from respiratory disease, diabetes, infections, neu-
rodegenerative disease, and kidney disease and the potential
for selective reporting cannot be entirely excluded. How-
ever, it is also possible that most of the included studies
may have been too small to have adequate power to investi-
gate these less common causes of death. Further studies are
therefore needed on these and other less common causes
of death. We did not identify any potentially relevant
studies in non-English language, thus language bias is less
likely to have influenced the findings. None of the included
studies were identified solely from the screening of article
references, thus it seems less likely that citation bias has
had any influence on the results. Although the initial study
selection was performed by one author, two authors
independently assessed the potentially relevant studies for
inclusion, and all studies included in previous reviews were
identified by the search as well as additional studies that
were missed by previous reviews, suggesting that selection
bias is also less likely to be an issue.
The number of studies that investigated specific types
of nuts was limited; thus, any further studies should try
to clarify associations between specific subtypes of nuts
and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality. How-
ever, randomized controlled trials have suggested similar
effects of different types of nuts on cardiovascular risk
factors [4], which supports our findings with regard to
peanuts and tree nuts in relation to coronary heart dis-
ease and cardiovascular disease and overall mortality, al-
though only tree nuts were associated with reduced risk
of cancer. The PREDIMED study suggested similar associ-
ations between walnuts and all other nuts in relation to
cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality; however,
walnuts were more strongly associated with cancer mor-
tality than all other nuts [21]. As in any meta-analysis of
published studies, publication bias could have influenced
the results; however, there was evidence of publication
bias only in the analysis of all-cause mortality, but after
exclusion of four studies with less than 500 deaths [10, 18,
21, 22], the test for publication bias was not significant,
but the summary estimates remained similar, thus publica-
tion bias has most likely not substantially influenced the
overall findings.
Although results from observational studies alone can-
not be used to draw conclusions with regards to whether
the observed associations are causal, one randomized
trial (the PREDIMED study) also found a reduced risk of
cardiovascular disease in subjects randomized to a Medi-
terranean diet with nuts compared to subjects random-
ized to a control diet [64]; however, it is not clear if this
association is due to the Mediterranean diet component,
nuts, or a combination of the two. In addition, several
mechanisms might explain the beneficial effect observed
between nut intake and cardiovascular disease, total can-
cer, and all-cause mortality. Nuts are good sources of
unsaturated fatty acids, protein, fiber, vitamin E, potas-
sium,
magnesium,
and
phytochemicals.
Intervention
studies have shown that nut consumption reduces total
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the
ratio of low- to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and
ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apo-
lipoprotein B, and triglyceride levels in a dose–response
manner [4, 65]. In addition, studies have shown reduced
endothelial dysfunction [8], lipid peroxidation [7], and
insulin resistance [6, 66] with a higher intake of nuts.
Oxidative damage and insulin resistance are important
pathogenic drivers of cancer [67, 68] and a number of
specific causes of death [69]. Nuts and seeds and par-
ticularly walnuts, pecans, and sunflower seeds have a
high antioxidant content [70], and could prevent cancer
by reducing oxidative DNA damage [9], cell proliferation
[71, 72], inflammation [73, 74], and circulating insulin-
like growth factor 1 concentrations [75] and by inducing
apoptosis [71], suppressing angiogenesis [76], and alter-
ing the gut microbiota [77]. Although nuts are high in
total fat, they have been associated with lower weight
gain [78–80] and lower risk of overweight and obesity
[79] in observational studies and some randomized con-
trolled trials [80]. However, the inverse associations
Aune et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:207 
Page 11 of 14
 observed between nut intake and chronic disease in this
meta-analysis persisted among studies that adjusted for
BMI, suggesting an association independent of BMI.
In addition, it is possible that a high intake of nuts
may reduce the severity of disease and progression to
death as indicated by studies which found that patients
with diabetes, coronary heart disease, and heart failure
who consumed more nuts had a reduced risk of cardiovas-
cular disease or all-cause mortality [81–83]. Although we
observed similar associations for both incidence and
mortality from coronary heart disease and cardiovas-
cular disease, epidemiological studies on nut con-
sumption and type 2 diabetes incidence have largely
shown no association [29], while in the present meta-
analysis we found a reduced risk of diabetes mortality,
which might be due to reduced risk of cardio-metabolic
risk factors and complications in diabetes patients with a
high nut intake [83–85].
Strengths of the current meta-analysis include the
comprehensive and up-to-date search strategy that iden-
tified several large additional studies; inclusion of pro-
spective studies, which limits the possibilities for certain
biases; the detailed dose–response analyses, which clari-
fied the amount of nut intake needed to reduce the risk
of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause and
cause-specific mortality; the consistency and robustness
of the findings in a number of subgroup and sensitivity
analyses; the high study quality of the included studies;
and the large number of participants, which provided
statistical power to detect moderate associations be-
tween nut consumption and different health outcomes.
The observation that nut intake was inversely associated
with these outcomes in both men and women and when
stratified by geographic location, is a further strength of
the analysis.
We estimated that approximately 4.4 million deaths in
the regions included may be attributable to nut consump-
tion below 20 grams per day. As shown in the current
meta-analysis, nut consumption appears to reduce the risk
of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease overall,
total cancer, all-cause mortality, and mortality from
respiratory disease, diabetes and possibly other causes, so
using data on nut intake and all-cause mortality will
provide a more comprehensive assessment of the mortality
burden due to low nut consumption than only analys-
ing mortality from specific diseases (such as coronary
heart disease and cancer), at least for regions with a
similar distribution of specific causes of death as those
included in the meta-analysis. Another limitation is that,
for the calculation of the population-attributable risk, we
did not find dietary surveys on nut intake from some
regions, including Africa, the Middle East and West-Asia,
and therefore, in a global context, these estimates are
conservative.
These findings support recommendations to increase
intake of nuts to reduce risk of chronic diseases and pre-
mature mortality in the general population. However, in
regions of the world where nuts are a major source of
aflatoxin [86], increasing nut intake should only be rec-
ommended as long as aflatoxin contamination is avoided
in the affected countries. Any further studies should
investigate associations with specific types of nuts and
the association between nut intake and incidence and
mortality from less common diseases, adjust for more
dietary confounders, clarify mechanisms underlying
non-cardiovascular causes of death, and investigate
associations between biomarkers of nut consumption
in relation to health outcomes [87, 88]. In addition,
further studies from other regions of the world are
also needed.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our results provide further evidence that nut
consumption may reduce the risk of coronary heart
disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-
cause mortality, and possibly mortality from diabetes, re-
spiratory disease, and infectious disease. In 2013, an esti-
mated 4.4 million deaths may be attributable to a nut
intake below 20 grams per day in North and South
America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pa-
cific. These findings support dietary recommendations
to increase nut consumption to reduce chronic disease
risk and mortality.
