SUMMARY
Chromosomal
translocations
encode
oncogenic
fusion proteins that have been proven to be causally
involved in tumorigenesis. Our understanding of
whether such genomic alterations also affect non-
coding RNAs is limited, and their impact on circular
RNAs (circRNAs) has not been explored. Here, we
show that well-established cancer-associated chro-
mosomal translocations give rise to fusion circRNAs
(f-circRNA) that are produced from transcribed
exons of distinct genes affected by the transloca-
tions. F-circRNAs contribute to cellular transforma-
tion, promote cell viability and resistance upon ther-
apy, and have tumor-promoting properties in in vivo
models. Our work expands the current knowledge
regarding molecular mechanisms involved in cancer
onset and progression, with potential diagnostic and
therapeutic implications.
INTRODUCTION
Recurrent genomic alterations such as point mutations, chromo-
somal deletions, amplifications, and translocations have been
historically associated with the pathogenesis of several dis-
eases, including cancer (Chin et al., 2011; Meyerson et al.,
2010; Rabbitts, 1994). The role of genomic alterations in the pro-
cess of tumorigenesis is attributed to their capacity to affect or
generate proto-oncogenic and tumor suppressive proteins.
Such proteins are generally mutated versions of functional
cellular proteins and are often the primary cause of the onset
and progression of cancer. For instance, cancer-associated
aberrant chromosomal translocations that result in the rear-
rangement of parts of non-homologous chromosomes can join
together two otherwise-separated genes leading to the forma-
tion of a ‘‘fusion gene.’’ As a result, a downstream gene may
fall under the promoter of the upstream gene and, in some in-
stances, in the transcription of a fusion mRNA that is often, but
not always, translated into a protein made from elements of
both genes. Such proteins are labeled as oncogenic ‘‘fusion pro-
teins’’ (Greuber et al., 2013; Somervaille and Cleary, 2010).
Although oncogenic proteins are undoubtedly critical factors
in cancer development, there is mounting evidence demon-
strating that proteins are not the only entities involved in disease
pathogenesis. The non-coding dimension, which includes mi-
croRNAs (miRNAs) (Croce, 2009; Ryan et al., 2010), pseudo-
genes (Karreth et al., 2015), long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
(Cheetham et al., 2013), and the recently re-discovered circular
RNAs (circRNAs) (Jeck et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015a; Qu et al.,
2015), is drawing renewed attention in cancer research. How-
ever, whether and how genomic alterations impact the non-cod-
ing RNA dimension has been, so far, only poorly investigated
(Calin and Croce, 2007), and their impact on circRNAs is
completely unexplored.
Discovered more than 30 years ago (Hsu and Coca-Prados,
1979), circRNAs have not been a focal point of research until
recently, when new reports began to show their direct involve-
ment in multiple biological processes (Jeck and Sharpless,
2014; Jeck et al., 2013; Qu et al., 2015; Hansen et al., 2013;
Memczak et al., 2013). Additionally, several recent publications
have convincingly demonstrated that the formation of circRNAs
is not just a result of splicing errors. The biogenesis of circRNAs
is instead actively regulated and favored by the presence of spe-
cific and repetitive sequences’ and RNA-binding proteins’
(RBPs) binding sites within the introns up- and downstream of
the circularizing exons (Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014; Barrett et al.,
2015; Conn et al., 2015; Jeck et al., 2013; Liang and Wilusz,
2014; Zhang et al., 2014). Thus, circRNAs are described as the
result of a proactive back-splice event, in which the 30 tail of
one exon is joined to the 50 head of an upstream exon (Jeck
et al., 2013). Although some of the molecular and biological roles
played by circRNAs have been characterized (Hansen et al.,
2013; Li et al., 2015d; Memczak et al., 2013; You et al., 2015),
the function of circRNAs remains largely unknown.
Multiple tumor types including liquid and solid tumors are asso-
ciated with recurrent chromosomal translocations (Rabbitts,

 1994; Bunting and Nussenzweig, 2013). Here, we show that
tumors harboring chromosomal translocations also harbor
circRNAs derived from the rearranged genome: aberrant
fusion-circRNAs
(f-circRNA).
We
further
show
that
such
f-circRNAs can be functionally relevant and tumor promoting,
with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
RESULTS
F-circRNAs Are a Product of Aberrant Chromosomal
Translocations in Cancer Cells
Multiple tumor types are characterized by the presence of aber-
rant chromosomal translocations and chromosomal rearrange-
ments (Rabbitts, 1994; Bunting and Nussenzweig, 2013). These
rearrangements result first in the juxtaposition of two otherwise-
separated genes, then in the transcription of a fused mature
mRNA, and finally in the expression of specific fusion oncogenic
proteins (Rabbitts, 1994). Because genes are incorrectly reallo-
cated, we hypothesized that distant, unrelated intronic se-
quences of the translocated genes may also be juxtaposed. As
a consequence, complementary repetitive intronic sequences
(e.g., Alu-sequences) could be brought in at a close enough
proximity to favor new events of back-splicing during the pro-
cess or RNA maturation, which would result in the generation
of aberrant circRNAs (Barrett et al., 2015; Jeck et al., 2013; Liang
and Wilusz, 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). We thus hypothesized that
the juxtaposition of complementary sequences in introns up-
and downstream of the breakpoint region of the translocation
could allow the formation of new circRNAs, f-circRNAs, made
by the fusion of the two translocated genes (Figure 1A). In order
to investigate this possibility, we at first used primers diverging
from the breakpoint of the translocation and we looked for the
presence of f-circRNAs through PCR assays.
Several types of leukemia are known to carry distinctive chro-
mosomal translocations, among them, PML/RARa is the most
recurrent translocation in patients with acute promyelocytic leu-
kemia (APL) (Dos Santos et al., 2013). In this translocation, the
main break point cluster region (BCR) of the PML gene is located
in intron 6, while the main BCR of RARa, the partner gene of
PML, lays in intron 2 (Figure 1B) (Dekking et al., 2012). Using pri-
mary samples from patients that harbor this translocation, we
investigated whether PML/RARa could generate f-circRNAs (f-
circPR for brevity). Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow
(BM)-derived leukemic cells of APL patients, or human primary
leukemic cells of control, and subjected to treatment with
RNase-R (Jeck and Sharpless, 2014). Divergent primers were
next used to amplify possible f-circPRs (Figures 1B and S1A).
All of the analyzed patients that carry the PML/RARa transloca-
tion (confirmed by the use of convergent primers spanning the
break point; Figures 1B and 1C) displayed the expression of
one or more f-circPR (Figure 1C). By sequencing the PCR prod-
ucts, we ascertained that all of the patients expressed an isoform
of f-circPR with the back-splice junction between the 50 head of
PML exon 5 and the 30 tail of RARa exon 6 (Figure S1B). Howev-
er, three out of four patients showed expression of an additional,
alternative f-circPR, whose back-splice junction occurs between
the exon 4 of PML and the exon 4 of RARa (Figures 1C and S1B).
In order to further validate these results, we also analyzed the
presence of f-circRNA in the APL-derived leukemic cell line
NB4 (Lanotte et al., 1991). Only one f-circRNA was detected in
the NB4 cells, whose back-splice junction was sequenced be-
tween the 50 head of the exon 5 of PML and the 30 tail of the
exon 6 of RARa (Figures 1D and S1C). We concluded that, as
a result of a paradigmatic chromosomal translocation such as
the t(15;17) of APL, the PML/RARa fusion gene can give rise to
one or more f-circRNAs.
We next extended our investigation of f-circRNAs to other
chromosomal translocations. The MLL gene has multiple fusion
partners in acute myeloid leukemia (Krivtsov and Armstrong,
2007), and among them, a recurrent fusion partner is AF9
(MLLT3). We thus investigated whether the MLL/AF9 aberrant
translocation could also generate f-circRNAs. To this end, we
used THP1 cells in which MLL is broken after exon 8 and is joined
to AF9, which loses its first 5 exons (Tsuchiya et al., 1980) (Figures
1E and S1D). Amplification with primers diverging from the
breakpoint followed by Sanger sequence revealed that MLL/
AF9 translocation bears two distinct f-circRNAs (f-circM9_1
and f-circM9_2 for brevity). f-circM9_1 displayed its back-splice
junction between the 50 head of MLL exon 7 and the 30 tail of AF9
exon 6, while f-circM9_2 displayed its back-splice junction
between the 50 head of MLL exon 5 and the 30 tail of AF9 exon 6
(Figures 1F and S1E). Thus, multiple f-circRNAs can be generated
from PML-RARa and MLL/AF9 fusion genes.
Finally, we investigated whether the formation of f-circRNAs is
an exclusive feature of leukemic cells, or whether it is also com-
mon to tumors of different histological origins. To this end, we
analyzed solid tumors, and investigated if the EWSR1/FLI1
translocation, associated with Ewing Sarcoma (Anderson et al.,
2012), and the EML4/ALK1 translocation, associated with lung
cancer
(Martelli
et
al.,
2009),
could
also
originate
from
f-circRNAs. SK-NEP-1 sarcoma cell line cells (Smith et al.,
2008) and H3122 lung cancer cell lines were therefore used for

 this analysis. Sanger sequence revealed that sarcoma cells dis-
played expression of f-circRNAs composed by EWSR1 and its
partner FLI1 (f-circEF1), with the back-splice junction encom-
passing the 50-head of EWSR1 exon 7 and exon 10 of FLI1 (Fig-
ures S2A and S2B). Similarly, lung cancer cell lines harboring
the EML4/ALK1 translocation (Figure S2C) showed the expres-
sion of a f-circRNA composed by EML4 and ALK1 (f-circEA1),
with back-splice junction located between the 50 head of EML4
exon 12 and the 30 tail of ALK1 exon 26 (Figure S2D).
We next utilized an alternative approach for the identification
of f-circRNAs. To this end, samples, whose expression of
f-circRNAs was previously assessed by PCR, were submitted to
RiboMinus-enriched RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and next
analyzed for the presence of reads spanning either the break-
point region or the back-splice junction. We used two different
approaches for the analysis of the f-circRNAs: method 1 and
method 2. As reported in Figures S2E and S2F, method 1 consists
of a single read mapping step, in which RNA-seq reads are
directly mapped to the linear RNA fusion and f-circRNA fusion
reference libraries using bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009). Next,
among the mapped reads, reads containing the spliced junction
of linear fusions and the back-spliced junction of f-circRNAs are
identified. Finally, reads meeting the following three conditions
are selected: (1) mapping to the f-circRNA or linear RNA fusion
reference libraries, (2) containing the spliced or back-spliced
junction, and (3) containing at least w bases per read from each
gene involved in the fusion. We definedw as the minimum number
of bases, which produced no false positive reads for the identifi-
cation of linear fusion reads in both method 1 and method 2. We
defined a false positive linear fusion read as the identification of
a linear fusion read among cases not reported as containing the
translocation (i.e., identification of a PML/RARa fusion transcript
among a case reported as MLL/AF9). Method 2 consists of two
read mapping steps. We first perform a filtering step to eliminate
all RNA-seq reads that map to the human transcriptome down-
loaded from University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) reference
data repository. (Guo et al., 2014; Memczak et al., 2013; Salzman
et al., 2013). After this filtering step, the remaining unmapped
reads are mapped to the linear RNA fusion and f-circRNA fusion
reference libraries using bowtie, and linear fusion RNAs and
f-circRNAs are identified using the same three conditions as in
method 1 (See Tables S1–S3). The results obtained by the appli-
cation of these pipelines are summarized in Figure 1G. Notably,
for the identification of f-circRNAs, we counted only reads that
span the back-splice junction of the f-circRNA, and we excluded
allthosereads thatmappedsharedsequences between thelinear
transcript and the f-circRNA. Thus, because of these strict bioin-
formatics criteria and the fact that the back-splice reads are by
definition fewer than the shared reads from flanking sequences,
the true prevalence of f-circRNAs in these samples may be higher
than that reported in our analyses.
Taken together, the experiments and analysis show that
chromosomal
rearrangements
affect
the non-coding
RNA
dimension within tumor cells, particularly through the generation
of f-circRNAs.
F-circRNAs Are Proto-oncogenic RNAs that Contribute
to Cellular Transformation
Because translocations are early events in tumorigenesis and, in
some circumstances, are the primary cause of the tumor onset,
we investigated whether f-circRNAs themselves could play a
functional role in this context. We sought to study the specific
function of f-circRNAs with the goal of disentangling their
possible activity from that of the concurrently present fusion pro-
tein in tumor cells. At first, we expressed f-circRNAs in immortal-
ized, but not transformed, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs;
see Experimental Procedures), which do not express the
translocation and therefore do not express the fusion protein.
Circularizing exons were then cloned into expressing vectors,
together with up- and downstream flanking introns, in order to
favor the spontaneous formation of the f-circRNAs (Figures 2A
and S3A–S3C). The expression of f-circRNAs was assessed by
qRT-PCR (Figure S3B) and PCR (Figure S3C) analysis of the
specific back-splice junction of the f-circRNA. Importantly,
expression of f-circRNA was then reverted for functional studies
through the use of short hairpin circRNAs (shCircRNAs) targeting
their back-splice junction (Figure 2B). f-circRNA-expressing
cells were then compared to control cells (expressing an empty
vector) for proliferation rate, loss of contact inhibition, and their
transformed foci-forming capability. As shown in Figure 2C, cells
expressing f-circPR and f-circM9_1 (from hereafter f-circM9 for
brevity) both showed a higher proliferative rate when compared

 to cells expressing the empty vector. Accordingly, their ability to
form foci characterized by loss of contact inhibition was much
higher compared to control cells (Figure 2D; see Experimental
Procedures), suggesting that f-circRNAs are indeed functional
and tumor promoting. In order to confirm these results, we
next silenced the expression of f-circRNAs by transducing cells
with shCircRNAs spanning the f-circRNA back-splice junction
(Figure 2E). Intriguingly, the increased proliferation rate observed
in cells expressing f-circRNAs was reverted upon the silencing of
the f-circRNAs (Figure 2F), corroborating the notion that these
f-circRNAs (both for f-circPR and f-circM9) exert tumor promot-
ing activity in immortalized MEFs and are involved in the tumor-
igenic process independent of their linear transcript and their
fusion protein counterparts.
In order to obtain additional and independent support of
the functionality of f-circRNAs, we next adopted an alternative
experimental strategy. f-circRNAs-expressing vectors were mu-
tagenized at the splicing donor site (f-circRNA-mut), following a
strategyalreadyreportedin(Wangand Wang,2015)andasshown
in Figure 2G. f-circRNA-mut vectors allowed the expression of the
linear transcript, while impairing the circularization event (Figures
2G and S3D). Immortalized MEFs were then transduced with
either f-circRNA-mut vectors or regular f-circRNAs-expressing
vectors, and the cells’ proliferation and transformation were
then assayed. In line with our previous experiments, the expres-
sion of f-circRNAs (both for f-circPR and f-circM9) triggered cells
to increase their proliferation rate and to form foci, if compared to
the expression of f-circRNA-mut vectors (Figures 2H and 2I).
We next tested whether the expression of f-circPR and
f-circM9 would lead to the activation of common or distinct
proto-oncogenic pathways. Intriguingly, although the expression
of f-circPR and f-circM9 showed similar biological outcomes in
MEFs, we found that they triggered differentially the activation
of the PI3K and MAPK signal transduction pathways (Figures
S3E and S3F). This in turn suggests that f-circRNAs may exert
their tumorigenic activity through distinct signaling outputs.
Together, these experiments reveal that f-circPR and f-circM9
are biologically active, exerting pro-proliferative and proto-onco-
genic activities.
F-circRNAs Contribute to Leukemia Progression In Vivo
Experiments performed with immortalized MEFs allowed an
initial evaluation of the possible involvement of f-circRNAs in
cellular transformation. In order to directly test the role of
f-circRNAs in tumor cells in vivo, we utilized primary hematopoi-
etic cells and set up the conditions to study the involvement of
f-circRNAs during the onset and progression of leukemia. We
decided to focus our work on the MLL/AF9-AML model, and us-
ing this model, we investigated the role of f-circM9. At first we set
to address the question on whether f-circM9 alone was sufficient
to trigger leukemia from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To
investigate, HSCs were isolated from wild-type mice, trans-
duced in vitro with a vector expressing f-circM9 (or an empty
vector as control), and used for either in vitro methyl-cellulose
assays or transplanted back into sub-lethally irradiated recipi-
ents. Regardless of the expression of f-circM9, HSCs differenti-
ated during the methyl-cellulose cultures toward exhaustion
(data not shown). Similarly, none of the transplanted mice devel-
oped leukemia following the transplantation of the infected cells
in a 3-months follow up, and only very few donor-derived cells
were found in the BM of transplanted mice (data not shown).
These initial experiments suggested that f-circM9 is probably
not sufficient to trigger tumorigenesis on its own, and additional
oncogenic events might be required.
Because at the onset of chromosomal translocations, the for-
mation of f-circRNAs is always coupled with the presence of
f-Linear RNAs and the encoded oncogenic fusion proteins,
which have been already described as fundamental hits for the
tumorigenesis process, we decided to investigate the relevance
of f-circM9 in the presence of the MLL/AF9 fusion protein. HSCs
were therefore transduced with a GFP-labeled retroviral vector,
which expressed the cDNA of MLL/AF9, as described in Fig-
ure S4A. Infected cells were then transplanted in sub-lethally
irradiated mice. This vector expressed the fusion protein and
triggered a pre-leukemic phase. After 2 months from the trans-
plantation, mice started to develop leukemia, accordingly to
what has been previously reported (Krivtsov and Armstrong,
2007). GFP+ leukemic cells were then sorted out from recipient
mice and transduced in vitro, either with an empty vector or
the f-circM9-expressing vector (Figures 3A and 3B). As a further
control, in an independent experimental setting, leukemic cells
were also transduced with the f-circM9-expressing vector or
the f-circM9-Mut-expressing vector (Figures 3A–C). Cells ex-
pressing these vectors were re-sorted as dsRED+ cells and
used for in vitro and in vivo experiments. Sorted cells were
then plated in vitro in methyl-cellulose. After 5 days in culture,
proliferation and the capacity to form colonies were evaluated.
At the point of colony count, cells were then re-suspended and
used for a second round of methyl-cellulose assay. As shown
in Figure 3D, cells expressing f-circM9 together with the MLL/
AF9 fusion protein displayed an increased ability to proliferate
and form colonies in serial plating when compared to cells
expressing solely the MLL/AF9 fusion protein. Similar results
were obtained in the other experimental setting: MLL/AF9-
positive cells transduced with the f-circM9 showed proliferative
advantage and a higher colony-formation capacity when
compared to cells transduced with the f-circM9-Mut vector,
which was deficient for the formation of the f-circM9 (Figure 3E).
These ex vivo experiments contributed to strengthening the
hypothesis that f-circRNAs could contribute to the leukemogenic
process. To obtain in vivo evidence of their role in leukemogen-
esis, we next performed transplantations experiments. GFP+
leukemic cells (already expressing MLL/AF9 cDNA) were trans-
duced with f-circM9 or f-circM9-Mut vectors, re-sorted as
dsRED+ cells, and then transplanted into sub-lethally irradiated
mice. In order to study the contribution of the f-circM9 to leuke-
mogenesis at the single-cell level, transplantations were per-
formed with different cell numbers and in a limiting-dilution
setting, transplanting either 30,000 or 500 cells per recipient.
3 weeks after transplantation, recipient mice were sacrificed,
the expression of f-circM9 in leukemic cells was confirmed by
PCR, and the progression of leukemia was analyzed. No differ-
ence in the number of leukemic blasts was detected in mice
transplanted with a high number of leukemic cells. Irrespective
of the expression of the f-circM9, mice developed leukemia
and displayed similar percentages of leukemic cells within

tween the recipient mice (Figures 3F and 3G). The presence of
the f-circM9 favored the progression of the leukemia. Within
3 weeks, mice that were transplanted with leukemic cells car-
rying the f-circM9 together with the MLL/AF9 fusion protein (Fig-
ure 3F) showed an enlarged spleen and a higher number of
leukemic cells both in the BM and spleen (Figure 3G).
All together, these data support the notion that f-circM9, when
coupled with other oncogenic stimuli (e.g., the presence of the
oncogenic fusion protein), plays an active role in favoring leuke-
mia progression in vivo.
F-circRNAs Confer Resistance to Therapy In Vivo
Disease relapse following transient remission achieved with con-
ventional and targeted therapies still remains one of the central
problems in the treatment of leukemia (Bailey et al., 2008; For-
man and Rowe, 2013). Relapse is often associated with the
development of resistance to therapy and thus loss of respon-
siveness to further treatment (Ding et al., 2012; Zahreddine and
Borden, 2013). Since the expression f-circRNAs confers a prolif-
erative advantage to leukemic cells, we next investigated the
possibility that the expression of f-circRNA could also confer a
survival advantage and protection to cancer cells from drug-
induced apoptosis. To answer this important question, we per-
formed in vitro and in vivo experiments in the MLL/AF9 model.
Leukemic cells carrying the MLL/AF9 fusion protein were trans-
duced with f-circM9 or an empty vector. For in vitro experiments,
cells were sorted as dsRED+ and cultured in methyl-cellulose.
Arsenic trioxide (ATO) (Ito et al., 2008), an approved standard-
of-care drug for the treatment of leukemia, was then added to
the semi-solid medium; cells were cultured for 5 days, and
proliferation and colony formation were assessed. As shown in
Figure 4A, the presence of f-circM9 conferred protection to
leukemic cells upon treatment. Increase in the size and number
of colonies was observed at the end of the treatment for cells ex-
pressing the f-circM9, as compared to those infected with the
control vector (Figures 4A and S5A).
To corroborate these results, we used, in an independent
experimental setting, an additional standard-of-care approved
drug for leukemia treatment: cytarabine (Ara-C), (Lo
¨ wenberg
et al., 2011) (Lengfelder et al., 2012). K562 cells (Lozzio and Loz-
zio, 1979) were then transduced with viral vectors expressing
f-circM9; cells transduced with the empty vector were used as
control. F-circM9-expressing cells were sorted for a pure popu-
lation and were subsequently subjected to treatment with Ara-C
and ATO. As shown in Figure 4B, no differences in apoptosis
were detected upon the expression of f-circRNAs in untreated
cells. On the contrary, clear differences were noticed upon treat-
ment. Cells transduced with the empty vector showed signs of
apoptosis upon treatment with either Ara-C or ATO, while cells
expressing f-circM9 showed to be markedly protected and dis-
played reduced signs of apoptosis. These results further demon-
strate that f-circM9 can bestow to tumor cells a survival advan-
tage in response to therapy treatment, hence likely impacting
therapeutic outcomes.
Next, to further validate whether f-circM9 could confer protec-
tion to leukemic cells under treatment, we performed in vivo ex-
periments. In order to get a sufficient number of cells to perform
the experiment, we expanded leukemic cells expressing either
f-circM9 or the empty vector in primary recipients (Figure 4C).
The expression of the transgene was found to be maintained
throughout the entire experiment (Figure 4D). The same number
of leukemic cells were then derived from primary recipients and
transplanted into experimental mice (Figure 4C, secondary recip-
ients). After the onset of leukemia (2 weeks after the transplanta-
tion) mice were treated with Ara-C as described (Zuber et al.,
2009). 4 days post-treatment, micewere sacrificed, and leukemia
progression was analyzed. As shown in Figure 4E, mice trans-
planted with leukemic cells that expressed f-circM9 showed
enlarged spleens compared to mice transplanted with leukemic
cells of control. Importantly, the number of leukemic cells infil-
trating the spleen and the BM was higher in the f-circM9-expres-
sion setting compared to the control setting (Figure 4F).
Because the number of surviving cells in the treatment with
chemotherapy was higher where the leukemic cells expressed
the f-circM9 together with the MLL/AF9 fusion protein, we also
sought to investigate their levels of apoptosis. To this end, we
stained leukemic cells within the BM with AnnexinV-7AAD. The
overall number of apoptotic leukemic cells (GFP+) after treat-
ment was reduced in mice bearing leukemic cells that expressed
f-circM9, as compared to the controls (Figure 4G). These results
further demonstrate that f-circRNAs originating from chromo-
somal translocation are functionally active and can provide

F-circRNAs Are Critical for Human Leukemic Cells
Viability
While the experiments we have performed demonstrate a role
for f-circRNAs in cellular transformation and tumor progression,
we next assessed whether the expression of the endogenous
f-circRNAs is relevant to the survival of human leukemic cells
that endogenously carry the chromosomal translocation.
To this end, we first analyzed the expression, the subcellular
distribution, and stability of one of the two endogenous f-circM9s
(f-circM9_1) (Figure 1F) in THP1 cells, and then we performed
functional experiments aimed at knocking down the endogenous
f-circM9_1. In order to determine the localization of f-circM9_1,
we fractionated cells in cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and the
presence of f-circM9_1 was assessed in each fraction as number
of molecules of f-circM9_1 per ng of total RNA (Figures 5A–5C).
THP1 cells expressed lower levels of f-circM9_1 if compared to
its linear-fusion transcript. Interestingly, we observed the pres-
ence of f-circM9_1 in both cytosolic and nuclear compartments,
with enrichment in the cytosol, as compared to the nuclear frac-
tion (Figures 5A and 5B). Moreover, when compared to its linear
transcripts, f-circM9_1 showed higher stability (Figure 5C), in
agreement to what was already reported about other circRNAs
(Jeck et al., 2013).
We next targeted f-circM9_1 using shRNAs specifically
directed against the back-splice junction. We screened different
shCircRNAs in order to find a candidate that: (1) has the ability to
knock down the f-circM9_1 (assessed by PCR with divergent
primers) (Figure 5D), (2) does not effect the linear transcripts
and the MLL and AF9 proteins (assessed by western blot, Fig-
ure 5E, and by PCR using primers that can selectively recognize
the linear transcripts, Figure 5F), and (3) has no toxic effects on
unrelated cells (assessed by testing the shCircRNAs on leukemic
cell lines that do not carry the MLL/AF9 translocation, Figures 5G
and S6E). Only one of the screened shCircRNAs (shCircM9-2)
met all the three criteria and was therefore used to evaluate
the functionality of f-circM9_2 in THP1 cells (Figure 5G). The
knock down of f-circM9 in THP1 cells resulted in increased
apoptosis, as measured with the AnnexinV-7AAD staining (Fig-
ure 5G). We used a similar approach to identify a shCircRNA
effectively targeting f-circPR (Figures S6A–S6E). The knock-
down of f-circPR in NB4 cells also triggered apoptosis, while
increasing the expression of p21 and p27 compared to control
cells (Figure S6F). Thus, f-circRNAs play an important role in
maintaining the viability of leukemic cells.
DISCUSSION
Genomic alterations, particularly aberrant chromosomal translo-
cations, are responsible for the onset of many types of cancers,
like leukemia, as well as solid tumors (Rabbitts, 1994) (Bunting
and Nussenzweig, 2013). How such rearrangements can lead
to tumorigenesis has been explained by their ability to encode
and express oncogenic proteins. However, whether such alter-
ations of the genome could also simultaneously impact the
non-coding RNA dimension has been poorly explored to date.
Here, we investigated whether chromosomal translocations
could affect the circRNA’s dimension of cancer cells. This anal-
ysis allowed us to reach several important conclusions:
Chromosomal Translocations Generate Aberrant
F-circRNAs
The biogenesis of these circRNAs is favored by the juxtaposition
of otherwise-separated complementary intronic sequences up-
and downstream of the breakpoint region of the translocation
(Figure 6A). According to the presence of such complementary
regions within the introns that are located next to the breakpoint,
all of the fused primary mRNAs derived from chromosomal
translocations, in frame or out of frame, may potentially give
rise to f-circRNAs (Jeck et al., 2013). Initiation analysis of a few
chromosomal translocations occurring in various tumor types re-
vealed that f-circRNAs are generated in 50% of cases. Thus,
many other chromosomal translocations in addition to PML/
RARa, MLL/AF9, EWSR1-FLI1, and EML4/ALK1 described
here might generate f-circRNAs. F-circRNAs could be also
generated from the multitude of out-of-frame chromosomal
translocations observed in human cancer, which have not
been functionally characterized in view of the lack of protein
coding capability. Furthermore, we show that, as described for
circRNAs in normal cells from different tissues, multiple combi-
nations of circularizing exons can be generated from the same
fusion gene. On this basis, high-throughput bioinformatics plat-
forms should be developed to identify f-circRNAs derived from
all known chromosomal translocations.
Notably, recent reports have shown that circRNAs can be sta-
bly secreted in exosomes (Li et al., 2015c) and therefore utilized

 as diagnostic and prognostic markers for cancer (Bahn et al.,
2015; Li et al., 2015b; Salzman et al., 2012). In this respect,
f-circRNAs in secreted exosomes could be used as pathogno-
monic markers for many tumor types, especially for those whose
biopsies are difficult to obtain.
Additionally,
although
not
investigated
in
the
present
work, chromosomal translocation events can also ‘‘knock out’’
circRNAs normally generated from the wild-type loci involved
in the translocation, when these circRNAs encompass the
breakpoint region. A deeper investigation of these ‘‘inactivating’’
events and their functional consequences could be just as infor-
mative in revealing new tumor-suppressive players involved in
the onset and progression of the disease.
Aberrant F-circRNAs Are Functionally Relevant During
Cancer Development and Are Tumor Promoting
We demonstrated that f-circRNAs, together with other onco-
genic hits, are able to increase cellular proliferation rate and
contribute to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis both
in vitro as well as in vivo. These findings uncover a new layer of
complexity underlying the role of chromosomal translocations
in human disease pathogenesis, whereby the biological outputs,
in this case the oncogenic signals, might be not be solely limited
to the encoded fusion proteins. In this ‘‘multiple hits in one’’ sce-
nario, the concomitant expression in tumor cells of linear fusion
mRNAs (exerting a possible non-coding RNA function), fusion-
proteins, and f-circRNAs could be, in some instances, critical
for tumor onset and progression (Figure 6B). These findings
have a number of relevant corollary implications. Experimental
models that mimic the presence of the translocation only by
the expression of the related protein might not completely phe-
nocopy the human disease, in turn explaining the long latency
often observed in mouse models of cancer. Thus, in such
models, biological mechanisms relevant to tumorigenesis might
be missed. Second, and importantly, in all of the cases of out-of-

frame chromosomal translocations, the
generation of f-circRNAs could represent
a functionally relevant oncogenic element,
leading to tumor development, indepen-
dent of the fusion protein.
The Expression of F-circRNAs in
Cancer Cells Is Essential for Their
Maintenance and Confers
Resistance to Therapy
We demonstrate that, upon silencing of
endogenous f-circRNAs, cancer cells un-
dergo apoptosis, while f-circM9 expression protects cancer
cells from drug-induced apoptosis. On this basis, a deeper char-
acterization of the mechanisms of such resistance is needed to
identify new therapeutic targets, and pharmaceutical interven-
tions that are aimed at blocking f-circRNAs or their down-stream
effectors could prove beneficial, when paired with conventional
therapies, to eradicate the disease.
The mechanisms of action of f-circM9 might however be
distinct and not be shared with other f-circRNAs. Although the
expression of both f-circPR and f-circM9 leads to increased
cellular
proliferation
and
transformation,
different
cellular
pathways are switched on. Mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)- and AKT1-induced signals are simultaneously triggered
by the presence of f-circM9, while on the contrary, only a slight
increase of the p-AKT is observed in the presence of f-circPR.
These data suggest that each f-circRNA might exert a unique
biological function through distinct mechanisms of action within
cancer cells.
Collectively
our
work
demonstrates
the
existence
of
f-circRNAs and their relevance to human disease. Our observa-
tions expand on the current knowledge about the onset and pro-
gression of cancer and unravel new possible opportunities for
therapeutic intervention. The systematic identification and char-
acterization of f-circRNAs might therefore represent an impor-
tant step in the understanding of the genetic and molecular basis
of cancer development.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Lines and Reagents
THP-1, K562, U937, HL-60, Kasumi, and NB4 cell lines were maintained in
RPMI medium with 10% FBS. Arf�/� MEFs (early passages) were grown in
DMEM 10% FBS. Primary leukemic cells were maintained in StemSpan
(Stem Cell Technologies) supplemented with IL6 (15 ng/mL), IL3 (15 ng/mL)
TPO (50 ng/mL) and SCF (50 ng/mL). Cells were grown at 37�C in a 5% CO2
humidified incubator. In selected experiments, cells were treated with arsenic

 trioxide (ATO) 0.1 mM for primary cells and 1 mM for K562 or with cytarabine
(Ara-C) 0.5 mM.
Mice
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee. For limiting-dilution experiments (Figures 3F and 3G), leukemic cells
were transduced with retroviral vectors and then re-sorted for dsRED (Fig-
ure 3A). Sorted cells were then injected into sub-lethally irradiated recipients
at a concentration of 500 cells/mouse or 30,000/mouse; mice were sacrificed
and analyzed 3 weeks after. For treatment experiments, Ara-C was adminis-
tered daily for 4 days, at the concentrations published in Zuber et al. (2009).
Isolation of RNA, Treatment with RNase-R, and PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. RNase-R treatment was carried out for 15 min at 37�C us-
ing RNase-R (Epicenter) 2 U/mg. Treated RNA was directly reverse transcribed
using the RETROscript System (Life Technologies) with random decamer
primers. 40 ng of RNA were used for the PCR analysis of the f-circRNAs.
The PCR reactions were performed using HotStarTaq Master Mix (QIAGEN)
for up to 40 cycles. Primer sequences are provided in Table S4. PCR products
were visualized after electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. For sequencing,
PCR products were purified from the gel by using the QIAquick extraction
kit (QIAGEN). In selected experiments, qRT-PCRs were carried out using
SybrGreen reaction mix and StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems). LinM9 and f-circM9 were quantified by PCR, in respect to their
standard curve. In order to generate the standard curve, the PCR products
containing the back-splice junction (for f-circM9) or the break point (for the
LinM9) were cloned using the pGEM-T easy Vector System II (Promega), by
following the manufacturer instruction. The number of molecules was then
calculated by quantifying the PCR bands of f-circRNA or LinRNA, and by plot-
ting them to the serially diluted standard curve.
Western Blots
Cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer. The following antibodies were
used: rabbit anti-PML clone H-238 (Santa Cruz), rabbit polyclonal anti-RARa
(Santa Cruz), mouse polyclonal anti-b-actin (Sigma-aldrich), mouse mono-
clonal anti-HSP90 (BD Biosciences), anti-AF9 (Bethyl), anti-MLL (Bethyl),
anti-Akt (Cell Signaling), anti-pAkt (S473) (Cell Signaling), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell
Signaling), and anti-pERK1/2 (Cell Signaling).
Proliferation Assays, Crystal Violet Staining, and Focus Formation
Assay
MEFs were derived from p19-Arf�/� mice and immortalized in culture by
culturing for several passages. For the proliferation assay, cells were seeded
at a concentration of 5 3 104 cells per well in a 12-wells plate and cultured
for 5 days in complete medium (DMEM + 10% FBS) at 37�C. Cells were
then fixed every day and stained with crystal violet. For the focus formation
assay, cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 3 104 cells per well in a
12-wells plate, and the cultures were carried on for 10 days without changing
media. Once formed, the visible cell foci were fixed with 10% formalin for
30 min and subsequently stained with crystal violet. Crystal violet was then sol-
ubilized with 10% acetic acid, and their absorbance was measured.
Flow-Cytometry Analysis of Annexin-V+ Cells
Apoptotic cells were analyzed with 7AAD and Annexin-V-APC. Cells were
stained for 15 min with both markers and then analyzed using LRSII (BD,
PharMingen).
