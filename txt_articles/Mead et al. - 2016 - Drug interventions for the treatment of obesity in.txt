Background
Child and adolescent obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with significant short- and long-term health consequences.
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed (subsets not available on Ovid), LILACS as well as the trial registers ICTRP
(WHO) and ClinicalTrials.gov. Searches were undertaken from inception to March 2016. We checked references and applied no
language restrictions.
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions for treating obesity (licensed and unlicensed for this
indication) in children and adolescents (mean age under 18 years) with or without support of family members, with a minimum of
three months’ pharmacological intervention and six months’ follow-up from baseline. We excluded interventions that specifically dealt
with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic cause of obesity. In
addition, we excluded trials which included growth hormone therapies and pregnant participants.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data following standard Cochrane methodology. Where necessary
we contacted authors for additional information.

 Main results
We included 21 trials and identified eight ongoing trials. The included trials evaluated metformin (11 trials), sibutramine (six trials),
orlistat (four trials), and one trial arm investigated the combination of metformin and fluoxetine. The ongoing trials evaluated metformin
(four trials), topiramate (two trials) and exenatide (two trials). A total of 2484 people participated in the included trials, 1478 participants
were randomised to drug intervention and 904 to comparator groups (91 participants took part in two cross-over trials; 11 participants
not specified). Eighteen trials used a placebo in the comparator group. Two trials had a cross-over design while the remaining 19 trials
were parallel RCTs. The length of the intervention period ranged from 12 weeks to 48 weeks, and the length of follow-up from baseline
ranged from six months to 100 weeks.
Trials generally had a low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding (participants, personnel
and assessors) for subjective and objective outcomes. We judged approximately half of the trials as having a high risk of bias in one or
more domain such as selective reporting.
The primary outcomes of this review were change in body mass index (BMI), change in weight and adverse events. All 21 trials
measured these outcomes. The secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life (only one trial reported results showing no
marked differences; very low certainty evidence), body fat distribution (measured in 18 trials), behaviour change (measured in six trials),
participants’ views of the intervention (not reported), morbidity associated with the intervention (measured in one orlistat trial only
reporting more new gallstones following the intervention; very low certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (one suicide in the orlistat
intervention group; low certainty evidence) and socioeconomic effects (not reported).
Intervention versus comparator for mean difference (MD) in BMI change was -1.3 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.9 to -0.8;
P < 0.00001; 16 trials; 1884 participants; low certainty evidence). When split by drug type, sibutramine, metformin and orlistat all
showed reductions in BMI in favour of the intervention.
Intervention versus comparator for change in weight showed a MD of -3.9 kg (95% CI -5.9 to -1.9; P < 0.00001; 11 trials; 1180
participants; low certainty evidence). As with BMI, when the trials were split by drug type, sibutramine, metformin and orlistat all
showed reductions in weight in favour of the intervention.
Five trials reported serious adverse events: 24/878 (2.7%) participants in the intervention groups versus 8/469 (1.7%) participants in
the comparator groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.43, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.25; 1347 participants; low certainty evidence). A total 52/1043 (5.0%)
participants in the intervention groups versus 17/621 (2.7%) in the comparator groups discontinued the trial because of adverse events
(RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.52; 10 trials; 1664 participants; low certainty evidence). The most common adverse events in orlistat and
metformin trials were gastrointestinal (such as diarrhoea, mild abdominal pain or discomfort, fatty stools). The most frequent adverse
events in sibutramine trials included tachycardia, constipation and hypertension. The single fluoxetine trial reported dry mouth and
loose stools. No trial investigated drug treatment for overweight children.
Authors’ conclusions
This systematic review is part of a series of associated Cochrane reviews on interventions for obese children and adolescents and has
shown that pharmacological interventions (metformin, sibutramine, orlistat and fluoxetine) may have small effects in reduction in BMI
and bodyweight in obese children and adolescents. However, many of these drugs are not licensed for the treatment of obesity in children
and adolescents, or have been withdrawn. Trials were generally of low quality with many having a short or no post-intervention follow-
up period and high dropout rates (overall dropout of 25%). Future research should focus on conducting trials with sufficient power and
long-term follow-up, to ensure the long-term effects of any pharmacological intervention are comprehensively assessed. Adverse events
should be reported in a more standardised manner specifying amongst other things the number of participants experiencing at least
one adverse event. The requirement of regulatory authorities (US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency)
for trials of all new medications to be used in children and adolescents should drive an increase in the number of high quality trials.

Review question
Do drug (medicine) interventions reduce weight in obese children and adolescents and are they safe?
Background

Drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Across the world more children and adolescents are becoming overweight and obese. These children and adolescents are more likely
to have health problems, both while as children or adolescents and in later life. More information is needed about what works best for
treating this problem recognising that so-called lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and counselling) have limited efficacy.
Study characteristics
We found 21 randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups)
comparing various drugs plus a behaviour changing intervention such as diet, exercise or both (= intervention groups) usually with
placebo (a pretend drug) plus a behaviour changing intervention (= control groups). We also identified eight ongoing studies (studies
which are currently running but not completed yet). A total of 2484 children and adolescents took part in the included studies. The
length of the intervention period ranged from 12 weeks to 48 weeks, and the length of follow-up ranged from six months to 100 weeks.
Key results
The included studies investigated metformin (10 studies), sibutramine (six studies), orlistat (four studies) and one study group evaluated
the combination of metformin and fluoxetine. The ongoing studies are investigating metformin (four studies), topiramate (two studies)
and exenatide (two studies).
Most studies reported on body mass index (BMI) and bodyweight: BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated from weight and
height measurements (kg/m2). In children, BMI is often measured in a way that takes into account sex, weight and height as children
grow older (BMI z score). The average change in BMI across control groups was between a 1.8 kg/m2 reduction to a 0.9 kg/m2
increase, while across all intervention groups the average reduction was more pronounced (1.3 kg/m2 reduction). The same effect
was observed for weight change: on average, children and adolescents in the intervention groups lost 3.9 kg more weight than the
children and adolescents in the control groups. Study authors reported an average of serious side effects in 24 per 1000 participants
in the intervention groups compared with an average of 17 per 1000 participants in the control groups. The numbers of participants
dropping out of the study because of side effects were 40 per 1000 in the intervention groups and 27 per 1000 in the control groups.
The most common side effects in the orlistat and metformin studies were gut (such as diarrhoea and mild tummy pain). Common side
effects in the sibutramine trials included increased heart rate (tachycardia), constipation and high blood pressure. The fluoxetine study
reported dry mouth and loose stools. One study reported health-related quality of life (a measure of physical, mental, emotional and
social functioning) and found no marked differences between intervention and control. No study reported the participants’ views of the
intervention or socioeconomic effects. Only one study reported on morbidity (how often a disease occurs in a specific area) associated
with the intervention, where there were more gallstones after the orlistat treatment. Study authors reported one suicide in the orlistat
intervention group. However, studies were not long enough to reliably investigate death from any cause. No study investigated drug
treatment for children who were only overweight (obese children have a much higher weight, BMI or BMI z score than children being
overweight).
This evidence is up to date to March 2016.
Quality of the evidence
The overall certainty of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because there were only a few studies per outcome measurement, the
number of included children or adolescents was small, and due to variation in the results of the studies. In addition, many children or
adolescents left the studies before the study had finished.

Drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 B A C K G R O U N D
The prevalence of overweight and obese children and adolescents
has increased throughout the world, presenting a global public
health crisis (Ng 2014; WHO 2015). It is not only a problem in
high-income countries, but a high prevalence has also been found
in low- and middle-income countries (Wang 2012). Evidence sug-
gests that rates are slowing down or plateauing in high-income
countries; however, they are still rising in low- or middle-income
countries and prevalence continues to remain high in both (Olds
2011; Rokholm 2010). The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013
reported a mean of 24% of boys and 23% of girls from high-
income countries to be overweight or obese, whilst the estimated
percentages of boys and girls in low- or middle-income countries
who are overweight or obese are 13% each (Ng 2014). This report
used the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) age and sex
standardised cut points (Cole 2000). Furthermore, young children
also have a high prevalence of being overweight or obese with an
estimated 42 million overweight or obese children under five years
of age in 2010 (approximately 35 million living in low- or middle-
income countries - De Onis 2010); these statistics were based on
the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standard (WHO
2006).
An additional concern in some high-income countries, such as the
USA (Kelly 2013; Skinner 2014) and England (CMO 2014; Ells
2015a), is the rise in severe paediatric obesity. In England during
2012/2013, 2.9% of girls and 3.9% of boys, aged 10 to 11 years,
were classified as severely obese (body mass index (BMI) UK90
99.6th centile or greater - Ells 2015a). In the USA from 2011
to 2012, 2.1% of youths (aged 2 to 19 years) were categorised as
class 3 obese (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth
charts: BMI 140% of greater of the 95th percentile or BMI 40 kg/
m2 or greater - Skinner 2014).
Whilst the IOTF published an international definition for pae-
diatric severe (morbid) obesity in 2012 (Cole 2012), often severe
obesity prevalence is reported using country-specific cut points
making international comparisons difficult. Data from the USA
(Skinner 2014) and England (Ells 2015a) have shown that severe
paediatric obesity prevalence varies by socioeconomic status and
ethnicity, and may result in greater risk of adverse cardio-metabolic
events and severe obesity in adulthood (Kelly 2013).
The prevalence of overweight and obese children is influenced by
inequalities, where rates are higher in children from areas of high
deprivation in high-income countries (Knai 2012; Shrewsbury
2008), and from more affluent areas in low- or middle-income
countries (Lobstein 2004; Wang 2012). Other variables are also
likely to influence obesity prevalence including age, sex and eth-
nicity, with varying rates found in different groups in the USA
(Freedman 2006; Skinner 2014), England (HSCIC 2014), and
New Zealand (Rajput 2014).
Description of the condition
Being overweight or obese in childhood is associated with many
conditions which may affect both physical and psychosocial
health. Such conditions include hypertension, insulin resistance
and hyperlipidaemia in obese children and adolescents, also in-
cluding very young children (Bocca 2013; Freedman 1999; Reilly
2003; Weiss 2004). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has contin-
ued to increase in children and adolescents, with recent projections
in the USA suggesting a potential quadrupling from 2010 to 2050
in the number of youths (aged less than 20 years old) with type
2 diabetes (Imperatore 2012; Pinhas-Hamiel 2005). Being over-
weight or obese in early childhood has also been linked to increased
cardiovascular risk factors, such as high systolic blood pressure
(Falaschetti 2010), with such risksfactorsalsobeingpresentinpeo-
ple with type 2 diabetes (Maahs 2014). In addition medical condi-
tions such as sleep apnoea, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
and poor pulmonary function have also been linked to childhood
obesity (Dietz 1998; Ebbeling 2002; Lobstein 2004; Reilly 2003).
Furthermore, childhood obesity has been shown to be strongly
associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which
is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children and
adolescents (Aggarwal 2014; Berardis 2014).
The condition can also affect the child’s mental health and lead
to early discrimination, low self-esteem and depression (Dietz
1998; Puhl 2007; Tang-Peronard 2008). There is also evidence
that childhood obesity also tracks into adulthood (Parsons 1999;
Singh 2008; Whitaker 1997), and hence is associated with an
increased risk of ill health in later life (Reilly 2011).
Description of the intervention
Since childhood obesity can potentially have serious consequences
on a child’s health and well-being, it is very important to identify
interventions which can treat obesity in both the short- and long-
term. The purposes of such interventions are similar to treatment
inadultswherebythe primaryaimsare: toreduce energyintake, in-
crease energy expenditure and decrease sedentary behaviour. How-
ever, the child’s age and baseline degree of obesity should be taken
into consideration before deciding the type, length and intensity
of the intervention. This will allow the intervention to be more tai-
lored to the target population and potentially increase the chances
of success and reduce the likelihood of adverse events.
In recent years, only three drugs have been licensed for the treat-
ment of adult obesity: rimonabant, sibutramine and orlistat. How-
ever, none of these were licensed for use in children (Petkar 2013).
Rimonabant was withdrawn from the market due to psychiatric
adverse events and sibutramine was suspended by the European
Medicine Agency (EMA) and was withdrawn by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 due to cardiovascular ad-
verse effects; however, sibutramine is still licensed for treatment of
obesity in Brazil. Orlistat has been approved by the FDA but only
7

 for people over the age of 12 years (Sherafat-Kazemzadeh 2013).
In England, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) guidance recommends that orlistat should only be used
in children under 12 years old in exceptional circumstances where
severe comorbidities exist. Moreover, in children who are 12 years
or older, treatment is only recommended if there are physical co-
morbidities such as sleep apnoea or severe psychological comor-
bidities (NICE 2014).
Metformin has been approved by the FDA to treat type 2 diabetes
mellitus in both adults and children over the age of 10 years but
does not have approval for treating obesity in children or adults
(McDonagh 2014). However, an analysis of prescribing data in
the UK in 2011 showed metformin has regularly been prescribed
to treat childhood obesity, the main indication being PCOS (
Hsia 2011). Other drugs which have also previously been used
off-licence to treat obesity in children and adolescents include
antidepressants such as fluoxetine and bupropion (Petkar 2013).
While weight loss alone may be of clinical and psychological bene-
fit, additional health benefits may be achieved by the amelioration
of obesity-related disorders, such as hyperglycaemia in type 2 dia-
betes(Pandey 2015), painandmobilityinosteoarthritis(Widhalm
2016), and improvement in obstructive sleep apnoea (Nespoli
2013). Weight loss may also reduce the risk factors for cardio-
vascular and metabolic disease (Halpern 2010), or even prevent
the development of disease, for example type 2 diabetes (Power
2014). While registration of drugs usually does not require such
clinical endpoints, people and health economic considerations in-
creasingly demand evidence on more than just weight or BMI re-
duction, data that would be more difficult to establish in children
and adolescents and have been poorly, if at all, studied.
Adverse effects of the intervention
One systematic review of pharmacological options for managing
paediatric obesity stated that the most common adverse events
when taking orlistat were gastrointestinal problems related to
increased fat excretion (e.g. fatty or oily stools, increased defe-
cation, soft stools, flatus, faecal leakage). Other adverse events
included long-term fat-soluble deficiencies, decrease in vitamin
D concentrations and asymptomatic gallstones (Boland 2015).
The most frequent adverse events associated with metformin are
gastrointestinal, some of which can be intolerable (McCreight
2016). A change in dose or duration may resolve these ad-
verse effects (McDonagh 2014). Common adverse effects of sibu-
tramine included dry mouth, headaches, constipation and insom-
nia (Cheung 2013). However, the drug has also been linked to in-
creasedriskof nonfatal stroke ormyocardial infarction,asshownin
the Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcomes (SCOUT) trial (James
2010). Consequently, the drug was withdrawn from the market
in numerous countries including the UK, USA and Australia.
How the intervention might work
Sibutramine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.
It works by reducing hunger and improving satiety leading to de-
creased food intake (Catoira 2010). Orlistat leads to the excre-
tion of approximately 30% of ingested fat; it works by acting as a
gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor (Yanovski 2014). Metformin is a
biguanide derivative which activates adenosine monophosphate-
activated protein kinase leading to the reduction of glucose pro-
duction and absorption in the intestines and increasing insulin
sensitivity. It is thought to reduce bodyweight by inhibiting fat cell
lipogenesis and potentially may decrease food intake by increasing
glucagon-like peptide (Matson 2012). Fluoxetine is an antidepres-
sant which works by inhibiting serotonin re-uptake. It can result
in weight loss by decreasing appetite and therefore inhibiting en-
ergy intake (Ye 2011). Hence, it is important to recognise that any
drug that produces aversive taste or gastrointestinal adverse effects
could produce weight loss by such adverse effects (Halford 2010).
Why it is important to do this review
In 2003, a systematic Cochrane Review was published entitled
“Interventions for treating obesity in children” which assessed
the effects of lifestyle interventions (dietary, physical activity, be-
havioural, or a combination of these) and included the analysis
of childhood obesity treatment trials published up to July 2001
(Summerbell 2003). The second version of this Cochrane Review
was published in 2009 providing an update to the 2003 review,
and assessing the effects of pharmacological and surgical interven-
tions (Oude Luttikhuis 2009).
To reflect the rapid growth in this field, the third update to this
review has been split across six reviews focusing on the follow-
ing treatment approaches: “Surgery for the treatment of obesity
in children and adolescents” (Ells 2015b); “Drug interventions
for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents”; “Parent-
only interventions for childhood overweight or obesity in chil-
dren aged 5 to 11 years” (Loveman 2015); “Diet, physical activity,
and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or
obesity in preschool children up to the age of 6 years” (Colquitt
2016); “Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for
the treatment of overweight or obesity in school children from the
age of 6 to 11 years”; and “Diet, physical activity, and behavioural
interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in ado-
lescents aged 12 to 17 years”. This review in this series focuses
on the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for obese chil-
dren and adolescents. The review complements the Cochrane Re-
view of “Long-term pharmacotherapy for obesity and overweight”
(Padwal 2003), which does not provide randomised controlled
trial (RCT) data on pharmacological interventions for children
and adolescents.
The results of this current review and other systematic reviews in
this series will provide information on which to underpin clinical

Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the following sources on 15 March 2016 from incep-
tion to the specified date.
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) via Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO).
• Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations and Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 15 March 2016).
• PubMed (subsets not available on Ovid) (15 March 2016).
• Embase 1974 to 2016 Week 11.
• LILACS (15 March 2016).
• ClinicalTrials.gov (15 March 2016).
• WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
(ICTRP; apps.who.int/trialsearch/) (15 March 2016).
For detailed search strategies, see Appendix 1. We continuously
applied an email alert service for MEDLINE via OvidSP to iden-
tify newly published trials using the search strategy detailed in
Appendix 1. If we detected additional relevant key words during
any of the electronic or other searches, we modified the electronic
search strategies to incorporate these terms and documented the
changes. We placed no restrictions on the language of publication
when searching the electronic databases or reviewing reference lists
of identified trials.
Searching other resources
We attempted to identify other potentially eligible trials or ancil-
lary publications by searching the reference lists of retrieved in-
cluded trials, (systematic) reviews, meta-analyses and health tech-
nology assessment reports.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
To determine the trials to be assessed further, two review authors
(of EM, LE, CO) independently scanned the abstract, title, or
both, of every record retrieved by the searches. We obtained full-
text articles of all those trials deemed potentially relevant for in-
clusion. We resolved any differences in opinion by consultation
of a third review author (of GA, EC, LE). If there was an out-
standing issue with the trial, we added the article to those ’await-
ing assessment’ and we contacted trial authors for clarification.
We presented an adapted PRISMA flow diagram of trial selection
(Figure 1) (Liberati 2009).

 Data extraction and management
For trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, two review authors
(of EM, LE, GA, NF, EC, LB, CO) independently extracted key
participant and intervention characteristics and reported data on
efficacy outcomes and adverse events using standard data extrac-
tion templates. We resolved any disagreements by discussion, or,
if required, by consultation with a third review author (of NF,
EC, LB, GA) (for details see Table 1; Appendix 2; Appendix 3;
Appendix 4; Appendix 5; Appendix 6; Appendix 7; Appendix 8;
Appendix 9; Appendix 10; Appendix 11).
We provided information, including trial identifier, about po-
tentially relevant ongoing trials in the Characteristics of ongoing
studies table and in Appendix 5. We tried to obtain the protocol
of each included trial, either in trial registers or in publications of
trial designs, or both, and specified the data Appendix 5.
We sent an email to all authors of included trials to enquire
whether they were willing to answer questions regarding their tri-
als. Appendix 12 shows the results of this survey. Thereafter, we
sought relevant missing information on the trial from the primary
author(s) of the article, if required.
Dealing with duplicate and companion publications
In the event of duplicate publications, companion documents or
multiple reports of a primary trial, we tried to maximise yield
of information by collating all available data and used the most
complete data set aggregated across all known publications. In case
of doubt, we gave priority to the publication reporting the longest
follow-up associated with our primary or secondary outcomes.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (of EM, LE, GA, NF, EC, LB, CO) indepen-
dently assessed the risk of bias of each included trial. We resolved
possible disagreements by consensus, or with consultation of a
third party. In cases of disagreement, the rest of the group were
consulted and a judgement was made based on consensus.
We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane’s ’Risk of bias’ tool
(Higgins 2011a; Higgins 2011b). We used the following criteria.
• Random sequence generation (selection bias).
• Allocation concealment (selection bias).
• Blinding (performance bias and detection bias), separated
for blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of
outcome assessment.
• Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias).
• Selective reporting (reporting bias).
• Other bias.
We assessed outcome reporting bias by integrating the results of
’Examination of outcome reporting bias’ (Appendix 6), ’Matrix of
trial endpoints (publications trial documents)’ (Appendix 5), and
section ’Outcomes (outcomes reported in abstract of publication)’
of the Characteristics of included studies table (Kirkham 2010).
This analysis formed the basis for the judgement of selective re-
porting (reporting bias).
We judged risk of bias criteria as ’low risk’, ’high risk’ or ’un-
clear risk’ and evaluated individual bias items as described in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011a). We presented a ’Risk of bias’ graph and a ’Risk of bias’
summary figure.
We assessed the impact of individual bias domains on trial results
at endpoint and trial levels.
For blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias),
detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors) and attrition bias
(incomplete outcome data), we intended to evaluate risk of bias
separately for subjective and objective outcomes (Hróbjartsson
2013). We considered the implications of missing outcome data
from individual participants.
We defined the following endpoints as self-reported outcomes.
• All self-reported data such as a self-reported health-related
quality of life questionnaires.
We defined the following endpoints as investigator-assessed out-
comes.
• All measured data such as assessor measured height and
weight.
Measures of treatment effect
We expressed continuous data as mean differences (MD) with
95% confidence intervals (CI). We expressed dichotomous data
as odds ratios (ORs) or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. We used
Comprehensive Meta Analysis (CMA) version 3 and Review Man-
ager 5 (RevMan 2014) to conduct the meta-analyses.
Unit of analysis issues
We tried to consider the level at which randomisation occurred,
such as cross-over trials, cluster-randomised trials and multiple
observations for the same outcome.
Dealing with missing data
We obtained relevant missing data from trial authors, if feasible,
and evaluated important numerical data such as screened, eligi-
ble, randomised participants as well as intention-to-treat (ITT),

 as-treated and per-protocol (PP) populations. We investigated at-
trition rates, for example dropouts, losses to follow-up and with-
drawals, and critically appraised issues of missing data and impu-
tation methods (e.g. last observation carried forward (LOCF)).
Where standard deviations (SD) for outcomes were not reported,
we imputed these values by assuming the SD of the missing out-
come to be the mean of the SDs from those trials where this infor-
mation was reported. We investigated the impact of imputation
on meta-analyses by means of sensitivity analyses.
Assessment of heterogeneity
In the event of substantial clinical or methodological heterogene-
ity, we did not report trial results as meta-analytically pooled effect
estimates. We identified heterogeneity by visual inspection of the
forest plots and by using a standard Chi2 test with a significance
level of α = 0.1, in view of the low power of this test. We examined
heterogeneity using the I2 statistic, which quantifies inconsistency
across trials to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the meta-anal-
ysis (Higgins 2002; Higgins 2003), where an I2 statistic of 75%
or more indicates a considerable level of inconsistency (Higgins
2011a). We also calculated Tau2, another statistic that provides
information about heterogeneity.
When we found heterogeneity, we attempted to determine po-
tential reasons for it by examining individual trial and subgroup
characteristics.
We expected the following characteristics to introduce clinical het-
erogeneity.
• Differences in the age of trial population.
• Differences in the trial population demographics.
• Differences in the types of drugs.
• Differences in BMI at baseline.
Assessment of reporting biases
If we included 10 trials or more for a given outcome, we used
funnel plots to assess small-trial effects. Due to several explanations
for funnel plot asymmetry, we interpreted results carefully (Sterne
2011).
Data synthesis
Unless there was good evidence for homogeneous effects across
trials, we primarily summarised low risk of bias data by means of
a random-effects model (Wood 2008). We interpreted random-
effects meta-analyses with due consideration of the whole distribu-
tion of effects, ideally by presenting a prediction interval (Higgins
2009). A prediction interval specifies a predicted range for the true
treatment effect in an individual trial (Riley 2011). In addition,
we performed statistical analyses according to the statistical guide-
lines referenced in the latest version of the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a).
Quality of evidence
We presentedthe overall certaintyof the evidence foreach outcome
specified under ’Types of outcome measures: Summary of findings
table’ according to the GRADE approach which considers issues
not only related to internal validity (risk of bias, inconsistency,
imprecision, publication bias) but also to external validity such as
directness of results. Two review authors (EM, GA) independently
rated the certainty for each outcome. We presented a summary of
the evidence in Summary of findings for the main comparison,
which provides key information about the best estimate of the
magnitude of the effect, in relative terms and absolute differences
for each relevant comparison of alternative management strategies,
numbers of participants and trials addressing each important out-
come and the rating of the overall confidence in effect estimates
for each outcome. We created the Summary of findings for the
main comparison based on the methods described in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a).
We presented results on the outcomes as described in Types of
outcome measures. If meta-analysis was not possible, we presented
results in a narrative form in Summary of findings for the main
comparison.
In addition, we established an appendix ’Checklist to aid con-
sistency and reproducibility of GRADE assessments’ (Meader
2014) to help with standardisation of ’Summary of findings’ tables
(Appendix 13).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses and
investigated interactions.
• Length of follow-up.
• Impact and nature of maintenance periods.
• The impact of comparator/control: whether concomitant
therapy or no treatment (true control).
• The impact of population demographics.
Sensitivity analysis
We planned to performed sensitivity analyses to explore the influ-
ence of the following factors on effect size.
• Restricting the analysis to published trials.
• Restricting the analysis considering risk of bias, as specified
in the Assessment of risk of bias in included studies section.
• Restricting the analysis to very long or large trials (more
than 300 participants in total) to establish how much they
dominated the results.
• Restricting the analysis to trials using the following filters:
diagnostic criteria, language of publication, source of funding
(industry versus other), country.
We also tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analysis
using different measures of effect size (RR, OR, etc.) and different
statistical models (fixed-effect and random-effects models).

Description of studies

of included studies, Characteristics of excluded studies and
Characteristics of ongoing studies tables.
Results of the search
Our comprehensive literature searches identified 4995 records;
from these, 199 full-text papers or clinical trial records were iden-
tified for further examination. We excluded trials based on their
titles or abstracts because they did not meet the inclusion crite-
ria or were not relevant to the question under trial (see Figure 1
for the amended PRISMA flow diagram). After screening the full
text of the selected publications, 21 completed trials (33 publica-
tions) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the quali-
tative synthesis of this review. All trials were published in English
apart from Franco 2014 (Portuguese) and Prado 2012 (Spanish).
We contacted all trial authors of the included trials and received
a reply from all but four authors (Atabek 2008; Berkowitz 2003;
Berkowitz 2006; Ozkan 2004). We sought additional informa-
tion from the authors of all 21 trials, 12 authors responded to
these requests and provided further data (Chanoine 2005; Clarson
2009; Franco 2014; Freemark 2001; Godoy-Matos 2005; Maahs
2006; Mauras 2012; NCT00001723; Prado 2012; Rezvanian
2010; Srinivasan 2006; Van Mil 2007). We also identified eight
ongoing trials, and an additional seven trials were placed in the
’awaiting classification’ section because we could not source the
full publication, the trial was completed but there was not yet
enough information to include it in this review or the publication
was identified when a final draft of the review had been completed
(NCT01487993).
Included studies
A detailed description of the characteristics of included trials is pre-
sentedelsewhere (see Characteristics of included studies; Appendix
2; Appendix 3; Appendix 4). The following is a succinct overview.
Source of data
The literature search identified all 21 included trials in the review
and all but one (NCT00001723) were published trials. Ten out
of 21 trials were included in the previous review (Oude Luttikhuis
2009), and information relating to these 10 trials was extracted
from the 2009 review - two review authors extracted any missing
information from the publication. All ongoing trials were found
from searching online clinical trial registers.
Comparisons
Of the 21 included trials, 11 used metformin in their intervention
arm; four of these trials gave metformin plus a behaviour changing
programme to the intervention group and used a placebo plus a
behaviour changing programme in the comparator group (Prado
2012; Wiegand 2010; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011). Two tri-
als compared metformin plus a behaviour changing programme
against a behaviour changing programme alone without using a
placebo (Clarson 2009; Mauras 2012). Four trials compared met-
formin plus a behaviour changing intervention against placebo
plus a behaviour changing intervention (Atabek 2008; Kendall
2013; Rezvanian 2010; Srinivasan 2006). Rezvanian 2010 alsohad
two additional intervention arms: metformin plus fluoxetine plus
healthy eating plus physical activity advice; and fluoxetine plus
healthy eating plus physical activity advice. The remaining trial
compared metformin with placebo; hence, there was no lifestyle
component included in either arm (Freemark 2001).
Six trials used sibutramine as the pharmacological intervention;
three trials compared sibutramine plus a behaviour changing pro-
gramme with placebo plus a behaviour changing programme
(Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz 2006; Van Mil 2007). The other
three trials compared sibutramine plus dietary/exercise advice with
placebo plus dietary/exercise advice (Franco 2014; García-Morales
2006; Godoy-Matos 2005).
Four trials investigated orlistat. Chanoine 2005, Maahs 2006, and
NCT00001723 examined orlistat plus a behaviour changing in-
tervention versus placebo plus a behaviour changing intervention.
Ozkan 2004 did not include a placebo in their comparator group;
hence, they compared orlistat plus a behaviour changing interven-
tion with a behaviour changing intervention only.
Overview of trial populations
A total of 2484 children and adolescents participated in the 21 in-
cluded trials. A total of 1851 participants finished the trial (74.5%)
and hence we measured at the study’s endpoint. In 10 studies, the
dropout rates were higher in the placebo group than the inter-
vention group, potentially showing some dissatisfaction with the
control condition. The individual trial sample size ranged from
24 to 539 participants.
The 11 metformin trials included 885 participants. The individ-
ual trial sample size ranged from 26 to 155 participants. One met-
formin trial also included two additional intervention arms of flu-
oxetine and fluoxetine plus metformin (45 randomised partici-
pants in each intervention arm).
The six sibutramine trials included 778 participants. The individ-
ual trial sample size ranged from 24 to 498 participants.
The four orlistat trials included 821 participants. The individual
trial sample size ranged from 40 to 539 participants.
Trial design
14
Drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents (Review)

 Trials were RCTs. Nineteen trials adopted a parallel group su-
periority design and two were cross-over trials (Franco 2014;
Srinivasan 2006). All but three trials used a placebo compara-
tor (Clarson 2009; Mauras 2012; Ozkan 2004). Five trials were
multicentred (Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005; Kendall 2013;
Wiegand 2010; Wilson 2010), with the number of centres rang-
ing from two (Wiegand 2010) to 33 (Berkowitz 2006). In terms
of blinding, 14 trials were double-blinded for participants and
personnel (Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005;
Franco 2014; Freemark 2001; Godoy-Matos 2005; Maahs 2006;
NCT00001723; Prado 2012; Rezvanian 2010; Srinivasan 2006;
Van Mil 2007; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011), no trials were sin-
gle-blinded for participants, and four trials did not define blind-
ing (Atabek 2008; García-Morales 2006; Kendall 2013; Ozkan
2004). Thirteen trials blinded outcome assessors (Berkowitz 2003;
Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005; Franco 2014; Freemark 2001;
Godoy-Matos 2005; Maahs 2006; NCT00001723; Rezvanian
2010; Srinivasan 2006; Van Mil 2007; Wiegand 2010; Wilson
2010; Yanovski 2011). Trialswere publishedbetweenthe 2001and
2014; all but one sibutramine trial were published before the drug
was withdrawn by the FDA - Franco 2014 was conducted in Brazil
where the drug is still licensed. All metformin trials were published
between 2006 and 2012 apart from Freemark 2001. Orlistat trials
were published between 2004 and 2006, but one trial did not have
any publications available and only posted results on a clinical trial
website and in a conference abstract (NCT00001723).
The durationof interventionsrangedfrom12weeksto17 months,
with a mean duration of 28 weeks. The duration of follow-up
(from end of intervention) ranged from 0 to 52 weeks, with a mean
follow-up period of 12 weeks. Participants in nine trials received
the intervention/comparator for six months with no additional
follow-up; in three trials, participants received the intervention/
comparator for six months, which was then followed by an open-
label period for six months (Berkowitz 2003; NCT00001723;
Yanovski 2011); two trials received the intervention for 12 months
with no additional follow-up (Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005);
two cross-over trials included a six-month intervention or control
condition followed by a washout period, then each participant
crossed over into the alternative condition for an additional six
months (Franco 2014; Srinivasan 2006); three trials included an
intervention/comparator period for three months (or 12 weeks)
then a follow-up period for an additional three months (or 12
weeks) (Prado 2012 Rezvanian 2010; Van Mil 2007); one trial
gave the intervention or comparator condition for 48 weeks, then
included an additional follow-up period for another 48 weeks (
Wilson 2010); andfinallyinone trial the length of the intervention
and follow-up varied across participants (Ozkan 2004).
Five trials had a run-in period, of which three included a placebo
run-inphase (Chanoine 2005; Godoy-Matos 2005; Wilson2010),
with a duration varying from two to four weeks; Freemark 2001 in-
cluded 48-hour inpatient tests as their run-in period; two trial gave
dietetic advice/counselling (García-Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos
2005); Wilson 2010 also included a lifestyle modification pro-
gramme in their run-in period. Outcomes were not assessed in
these run-in periods. Furthermore, three trials included an open-
label phase six months after randomisation where both groups re-
ceived the drug intervention (Berkowitz 2003; NCT00001723;
Yanovski 2011); these open-label phases were not included in our
analyses. Participants in one of these trials were also followed up
for two years after the open-label phase (NCT00001723). None
of the included trials were terminated before regular end; however,
two trials that we identified from ClinicalTrials.gov were termi-
nated before enrolment and have been placed in the excluded trials
section (see Characteristics of excluded studies table).
Settings
Nine of the 21 trials were conducted in the USA (Berkowitz 2003;
Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005; Freemark 2001; Maahs 2006;
Mauras 2012; NCT00001723; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011).
The other trials were completed in Turkey (Atabek 2008; Ozkan
2004), Canada (Chanoine 2005; Clarson 2009), Brazil (Franco
2014; Godoy-Matos 2005), Mexico (García-Morales 2006), the
UK (Kendall 2013), Australia (Srinivasan 2006), Chile (Prado
2012), Iran (Rezvanian 2010), the Netherlands (Van Mil 2007),
Germany (Wiegand 2010), and Switzerland (Wiegand 2010). All
trials were performed in an outpatient setting apart from three tri-
als which had both an inpatient and outpatient setting (Freemark
2001; Maahs 2006; Yanovski 2011).
Participants
The participating population consisted of the following: mainly
obese children or adolescents (Maahs 2006 also included over-
weight participants). The mean age of the participants in the
trials ranged from 10.1 to 16.3 years with only two trials hav-
ing a mean age less than 12 years old (Atabek 2008; Yanovski
2011). Two studies required all participants to be postmenar-
chal (Berkowitz 2003; Prado 2012), while Yanovski 2011 only
included children who were prepubertal or early pubertal. Fif-
teen trials included participants from high-income countries, and
six recruited participants from middle-income countries (Atabek
2008; Franco 2014; García-Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos 2005;
Ozkan 2004; Rezvanian 2010) - based on the World Bank list
of economies July 2015 (World Bank 2015). Ethnic groups were
distributed as follows: six trials did not report on ethnic groups
(Atabek 2008; Franco 2014; Ozkan 2004; Prado 2012; Rezvanian
2010; Van Mil 2007); one trial reported all their participants
were white (Clarson 2009), three trials reported approximately
75% of their population were white (Chanoine 2005; Kendall
2013; Wiegand 2010); five trials reported approximately half of
their population were white (Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz 2006;
Freemark 2001; Mauras 2012; Wilson 2010); one trial reported
thatapproximately60%of theirpopulationwere Hispanic(Maahs

 2006); one trial reported approximately 50% of their popula-
tion were non-Hispanic (Yanovski 2011); 63% of participants
in one trial were non-Hispanic black people while the remain-
ing were non-Hispanic white people (NCT00001723); and one
trial reported that 64% of their participants came from ethnic
backgrounds with a high prevalence of insulin resistance and
metabolic syndrome (Srinivasan 2006). Participants’ sex was not
distributed evenly in 11 trials (Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz 2006;
Chanoine 2005; Freemark 2001; Godoy-Matos 2005; Kendall
2013; Maahs 2006; NCT00001723; Prado 2012; Wiegand 2010;
Wilson 2010). Three trials reported glycosylated haemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) at baseline and the mean HbA1c ranged from
5.3% to 5.6% (Freemark 2001; Maahs 2006; Wilson 2010).
The mean BMI at baseline for the interventions groups ranged
from 26.5 kg/m2 to 41.5 kg/m2. The BMI at baseline for the
comparator groups ranged from 26.2 kg/m2 to 41.7 kg/m2.
Thirteen trials reported comorbidities of participants at baseline
(Atabek 2008; Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005; Clarson 2009;
Freemark 2001; García-Morales 2006; Kendall 2013; Mauras
2012; NCT00001723; Prado 2012; Srinivasan 2006; Wiegand
2010; Yanovski 2011), all but one trial (Freemark 2001) reported
cointerventions in participants, and four trials had comedications
used by participants (NCT00001723; Ozkan 2004; Wilson 2010;
Yanovski 2011). Criteria for entry into the individual trials are
outlined in the Characteristics of included studies table. Major
trial exclusion criteria were major illnesses such as type 1 or 2 dia-
betes mellitus or cardiovascular disease; pregnancy; major psychi-
atric disorders; taking or previously taken medication known to
influence body composition or contradiction to the drug therapy;
cigarette smoking or alcohol use; obesity associated with genetic
disorders; and eating disorders such as bulimia. Adherence/com-
pliance with the intervention was reported in most trials as good
(70% or more) and was usually assessed by pill counts.
Diagnosis
All trials included participants who were defined as obese at base-
line according to the growth reference they used, apart from one
trial (Maahs 2006), which also included overweight children in
their inclusion criteria. Seven trials define obesity using the 95th
percentile or greater cut-off on the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC; Kuczmarski 2000) charts (Atabek 2008;
Clarson 2009; García-Morales 2006; Mauras 2012; Rezvanian
2010; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011), but Wilson 2010 also re-
quired their participants to weigh less than 136 kg. One trial used
greater than 85th percentile (to include also overweight partici-
pants) (Maahs 2006), while Van Mil 2007 used the 97th percentile
or greater but also further selected for triceps skinfold thickness
97th percentile or greater for age and sex. NCT00001723 defined
obesity by BMI for age and triceps skinfold above the 95th per-
centile (determined by National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) I age-, sex- and race-specific data) and
all participants were required to be over 60 kg in bodyweight.
Alternatively two trials used the definition of obesity given by
Rosner 1998 of two units more than the US weighted mean of the
95th percentile but no greater than 44 kg/m2 (Berkowitz 2006;
Chanoine 2005). One trial used the IOTF (Cole 2000) defini-
tions for obesity (Srinivasan 2006), while another used the WHO
(WHO 1995) growth standards cut-off (Franco 2014). Kendall
2013 used the UK BMI growth charts (Cole 1995), and used the
98th centile as the cut-off for obesity. One trial used German refer-
ences (Kromeyer-Hausschild 2001) to define obesity using greater
than 97th percentile (Wiegand 2010). Three trials used raw BMI
to define obesity: BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 (Freemark 2001);
BMI 32 kg/m2 to 44 kg/m2 (Berkowitz 2003); and BMI 30 kg/m
2 to 45 kg/m² (Godoy-Matos 2005). In two trials, it was unclear
which growth reference charts they were referring to (Ozkan 2004;
Prado 2012). Participants were diagnosed with type 1 or 2 dia-
betes mellitus in none of our included trials. However, some trials
included additional inclusion criteria other than age and obesity:
Atabek 2008 required all participants to have hyperinsulinaemia;
Clarson 2009 onlyincludedparticipantswhowere insulinresistant
(defined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) for insulin
resistance values greater than 3); Godoy-Matos 2005 required all
participants to have an adult bone age determined by left hand
radiography (Greulich-Pyle method); Kendall 2013 only included
participants who had impaired glucose tolerance or hyperinsuli-
naemia; NCT00001723 only recruited participants who had co-
morbidities at baseline and these included hypertension, hyperin-
sulinaemia and hepatic steatosis; Srinivasan 2006 only included
participants where there was a suspicion of insulin resistance (fast-
ing insulin to glucose ratio greater than 4.5 or presence of acan-
thosis nigricans); Prado 2012 required all participants to present
with at least one risk factor for type 2 diabetes (e.g. first- or second-
degree relative with history of type 2 diabetes); Mauras 2012 only
included participants who had normal glucose tolerance but also
had elevated highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrino-
gen concentrations or both; Freemark 2001 inclusion criteria in-
cluded a fasting insulin concentration exceeding 15 IU/mL and at
least one first- or second-degree relative with type 2 diabetes; and
Yanovski 2011 required all participants to have hyperinsulinaemia
(defined as fasting insulin 15 IU/mL or greater). All participants in
Wiegand 2010 presented with comorbidities at baseline (features
of the metabolic syndrome); however, this did not appear to be an
inclusion criterion.
Interventions
Eleven trials used metformin as their pharmacological interven-
tion (Atabek 2008; Clarson 2009; Freemark 2001; Kendall 2013;
Mauras 2012; Prado 2012; Rezvanian 2010; Srinivasan 2006;
Wiegand 2010; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011). The intervention
was administered orally and varied between one and four times per
day. Between trials, the daily dosage of metformin varied between
16

 500 mg and 2000 mg, with a mean daily dosage of 1364 mg. Four
metformin trials reported treatment before the start of the trial
(Kendall 2013; Rezvanian 2010; Wiegand 2010; Wilson 2010);
this included a healthy ’lifestyle’ advice sheet, lifestyle modifica-
tion treatment and a six-month multiprofessional lifestyle inter-
vention. Seven trials had a titration period, consisting of increasing
the number of tablets taken over a period of weeks until the maxi-
mum dosage was tolerated (Clarson 2009; Kendall 2013; Mauras
2012; Rezvanian 2010; Srinivasan 2006; Wilson 2010; Yanovski
2011). Two trials did not have a matching placebo in the com-
parator group - participants received a lifestyle intervention only
(Clarson 2009; Mauras 2012). The duration of treatment ranged
from 12 weeks/three months to six months with a mean treatment
duration of 5.5 months.
Six trials used sibutramine as their intervention (Berkowitz 2003;
Berkowitz 2006; Franco 2014; García-Morales 2006; Godoy-
Matos 2005; Van Mil 2007). In all six trials, the drug was admin-
istered orally once daily. The daily dosage of sibutramine varied
between 5 mg and 15 mg, with a mean daily dose of 11 mg. Three
trials reported that participants received treatment before the start
of the trial (Franco 2014; García-Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos
2005); this included dietetic advice/counselling and a six-month
lifestyle intervention. Two trials had a titration period (Berkowitz
2003; Van Mil 2007). All trials had a matching placebo as the
comparator intervention. The duration of treatment ranged from
12 weeks to 12 months, with a mean treatment duration of 6.5
months.
Four trials gave orlistat to their intervention group (Chanoine
2005; Maahs 2006; NCT00001723; Ozkan 2004). The drug was
administered orally three times per day and the daily dosage of
orlistat was 360 mg in all four trials. No trials gave participants
any treatment before the trial. One trial did not give a match-
ing placebo to the comparator group - participants received a
lifestyle intervention only (Ozkan 2004). The duration of treat-
ment ranged from six months to 12 months, with a mean treat-
ment duration of 8.9 months.
One trial also included two additional intervention arms: met-
formin plus fluoxetine and fluoxetine only (Rezvanian 2010). The
drugs were given by the oral route once daily. The daily dose of
fluoxetine was 20 mg. Participants were also given lifestyle modifi-
cation treatment before the start of the trial. They also had a titra-
tion period. The comparator group received a matching placebo.
The duration of treatment was 12 weeks.
Outcomes
Fourteen trials explicitly stated a primary endpoint in the publica-
tion (Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005; Clarson
2009; García-Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos 2005; Kendall 2013;
Maahs 2006; Mauras 2012; Prado 2012; Van Mil 2007; Wiegand
2010; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011), 10 trials reported ’sec-
ondary’ endpoints (Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine
2005; García-Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos 2005; Kendall 2013;
Maahs 2006; Wiegand 2010; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011).
NCT00001723 had no publication attached; however, the trial
authors reported both a primary and secondary endpoint on the
clinical trials website. The most commonly defined primary out-
comes in publications were change in absolute BMI, change in
BMI z score/standard deviation score (SDS) and change in body-
weight. The most commonly defined primary outcomes in trial
protocols were change in BMI from baseline and per cent change
in BMI.
Reporting of endpoints
Twenty-one trials collected a mean of 14 (range four to 25) out-
comes. All 21 trials measured raw BMI. Ten trials reported change
in BMI z score/SDS (Berkowitz 2003; Clarson 2009; Freemark
2001; Kendall 2013; NCT00001723; Srinivasan 2006; Van Mil
2007; Wiegand 2010; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011). All 21 trials
reported on whetheradverse events occurred. Of those trials which
reported adverse events, some reported the total number of ad-
verse events whilst others reported the total number of participants
who experienced at least one adverse event. We asked all authors
to provide further details on adverse events, such as how many
participants experienced severe adverse events and if so, whether
they were hospitalised. Two trials measured health-related quality
of life with validated questionnaires (García-Morales 2006; Maahs
2006). Seventeentrialsreportedthattheymeasuredbodyfatdistri-
bution.Fifteentrialsmeasuredwaist circumference, hipcircumfer-
ence, or both (Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005;
Clarson 2009; Franco 2014; García-Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos
2005; Kendall 2013; Mauras 2012; Prado 2012; Rezvanian 2010;
Srinivasan 2006; Wiegand 2010; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011).
Seven trials measured body fat mass by DEXA (Chanoine 2005;
Mauras 2012; NCT00001723; Srinivasan 2006; Van Mil 2007;
Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011). Two trials also measured body fat
mass by bioelectrical impedance (Maahs 2006; Wiegand 2010).
Six trials measured behaviour change (Atabek 2008; Berkowitz
2003; García-Morales 2006; Kendall 2013; Maahs 2006; Van Mil
2007). Five trials measured food consumption through dietary
records or questionnaires (Atabek 2008; García-Morales 2006;
Kendall 2013; Maahs 2006; Van Mil 2007), and one trial mea-
sured the feeling of hunger (Berkowitz 2003). Two trials measure
changes in physical activity: Kendall 2013 used a physical activity
questionnaire and Van Mil 2007 measured total energy expendi-
ture which accounts for level of physical activity. Only one trial in-
vestigated morbidity defined as illness or harm associated with the
intervention (Chanoine 2005). One trial reported a death from
suicide (Maahs 2006). Berkowitz 2006 reported two suicide at-
tempts which did not result in death.
No trials assessed participants’ views or socioeconomic effects as
outcomes. For a summary of all outcomes assessed in each trial,
see Appendix 5.

 Excluded studies
We excluded 135 trials or trial records after careful evaluation
of the full publication. The main reasons for exclusion were the
participants were adults or had a mean age of more than 18 years,
the trial design was not an RCT, the duration of treatment was less
than three months or the duration of follow-up was less than six
months. For further details, see Characteristics of excluded studies
table.
Risk of bias in included studies
For details on risk of bias of included trials see Characteristics of
included studies table. For an overview of review authors’ judge-
ments about each risk of bias item for individual trials and across
all trials, see Figure 2 and Figure 3. We investigated performance
bias, detection bias and attrition bias separately for objective and
subjective outcome measures.

 Allocation
Fifteen trials reported allocation was concealed (Berkowitz
2006; Chanoine 2005; Franco 2014;Freemark 2001; García-
Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos 2005; Kendall 2013; Mauras
2012; NCT00001723; Prado 2012; Rezvanian 2010; Srinivasan
2006; Wiegand 2010; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011); two tri-
als did not conceal allocation (Clarson 2009; Ozkan 2004).
It was unclear whether four trials concealed allocation (Atabek
2008; Berkowitz 2003; Rezvanian 2010;Wiegand 2010) ). Four-
teen trials reported an adequate random sequence generation
(Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005; Clarson 2009; Franco 2014;
Freemark 2001; García-Morales 2006; Kendall 2013; Mauras
2012; NCT00001723; Prado 2012; Rezvanian 2010; Srinivasan
2006; Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011). Two trials reported random
sequence generation was inadequate; hence, would have likely of
introduced bias (Maahs 2006; Ozkan 2004).Five trials did not de-
scribe the randomisation process (Atabek 2008; Berkowitz 2003;
Godoy-Matos 2005; Van Mil 2007; Wiegand 2010).
Blinding
All 21 trials reported both objective and subjective outcomes. The
main objectives outcomes were BMI, weight, waist or hip circum-
ference, blood pressure, cholesterol insulin, glucose and triglyc-
erides, whilst the main subjective outcomes were adverse events,
food consumption and health-related quality of life. Subjective
outcomes tended to be self-reported (e.g. quality of life and dietary
questionnaires), while objective measures usually were investiga-
tor-assessed (e.g. BMI, waist circumference). Adverse events could
be either self-reported or investigator assessed.
Ten trials explicitly stated that blinding of the participants, per-
sonnel and outcome assessors was undertaken (Berkowitz 2003;
Berkowitz 2006; Franco 2014; Maahs 2006; NCT00001723;
Rezvanian 2010; Srinivasan 2006; Van Mil 2007; Wilson 2010;
Yanovski 2011). Seven trials reported that double blinding took
place (Atabek 2008; Chanoine 2005; Freemark 2001; García-
Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos 2005; Kendall 2013; Wiegand
2010), but only three of the trials’ authors confirmed this meant
blinding was undertaken of participants, personnel and outcomes
assessors (Chanoine 2005; Freemark 2001; Godoy-Matos 2005).
No trials reported that single blinding was undertaken. Six trials
did not provide sufficient information about blinding procedures
(Atabek 2008; García-Morales 2006; Kendall 2013; Ozkan 2004;
Prado 2012; Wiegand 2010).
Incomplete outcome data
Twenty trials that had losses to follow-up described the num-
ber of trial withdrawals (Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz 2006;
Chanoine 2005; Clarson 2009; Franco 2014; Freemark 2001;
García-Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos 2005; Kendall 2013; Maahs
2006; Mauras 2012; NCT00001723; Ozkan 2004; Prado 2012;
Rezvanian 2010; Srinivasan 2006; Van Mil 2007; Wiegand 2010;
Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011). Twelve trials used ITT analy-
ses (Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005; García-
Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos 2005; Kendall 2013; Maahs 2006;
NCT00001723; Rezvanian 2010; Van Mil 2007; Wilson 2010;
Yanovski 2011). One trial did not report whether there were any
losses to follow-up (Atabek 2008). Five trials did not provide de-
tailed descriptions of participants’ withdrawals and reasons un-
derpinning them (Atabek 2008; Franco 2014; Freemark 2001;
García-Morales 2006; Mauras 2012). Four trials had attrition rates
greater than 30% with possible impact on the outcomes(Chanoine
2005; Franco 2014; Mauras 2012; Prado 2012;Wilson 2010).
Selective reporting
Only nine trials provided a clinical trial identifier or reference
to a protocol (Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz 2006; Kendall 2013;
Mauras 2012; NCT00001723; Srinivasan 2006; Wiegand 2010;
Wilson 2010; Yanovski 2011); however, we were unable to source
the clinical trial entry of one trial (Wiegand 2010). Three trials
had a high risk of reporting bias after failure to report results for
one or more outcomes they described as having measured (Atabek
2008; García-Morales 2006; Maahs 2006), and a further trial had
a high risk due to differences in results reported on the clinical
trial website and in a conference abstract (NCT00001723). The
remaining trials had unclear risk of reporting bias due to no pro-
tocol being available.
Other potential sources of bias
Seven trials were at high risk of other biases. These biases in-
cluded: the trial not including a power calculation (Atabek 2008;
Clarson 2009; Franco 2014; Freemark 2001; Godoy-Matos 2005;
Ozkan 2004), the trial lacking methodological detail (Atabek
2008; Franco 2014) and the trial not adjusting for baseline differ-
ences (Freemark 2001; Ozkan 2004), The remaining 14 trials were
at unclear risk of other potential sources of bias. It is important
to note that the trials which do not include a power calculation
may not be powered to detect differences in their primary out-
come. BMI or weight was the primary outcome in all but two trials
(Mauras 2012; Wiegand 2010) that included a power calculation.
Mauras 2012 and Wiegand 2010 may not have been adequately
powered to detect differences in BMI or weight. With regards to
adverse events and the review’s secondary outcomes (e.g. morbid-
ity), it is likely that most trials would not have been powered to
detect differences in these outcomes. Hence, these results should
be interpreted with caution.

Baseline characteristics

Pharmacological intervention versus comparators
We performed the meta-analyses with CMA software version 3
and aligned with the data in the Review Manager 5 (RevMan
2014) meta-analyses. Because the cross-over design did not appear
suitable for our research question due to inadequate washout pe-
riods and noncomparable baseline measures in the two cross-over
periods, we excluded Franco 2014 and Srinivasan 2006 from all
meta-analyses. We also excluded Rezvanian 2010 from the meta-
analyses because the reported SDs were unreliably small in com-
parison to all other published SDs of included trials and probably
denoted standard errors. We excluded two further trials because of
substantial methodological concerns (Ozkan 2004; Prado 2012).
In addition, Prado 2012 did not report change in BMI from base-
line to follow-up and Ozkan 2004 did not have a consistent fol-
low-up time frame across all participants.
Primary outcomes
Body mass index and bodyweight
We included 16 trials in the meta-analysis of BMI. Most of the
BMI data were from the publications, except for Chanoine 2005
and Freemark 2001, where raw BMI, SDs or both were not avail-
able; hence, we obtained additional data from the trial authors.
We extracted data for NCT00001723 from the ClinicalTrials.gov
website. In the meta-analysis, we included trials which had either a
six-month or 12-month follow-up from baseline (Berkowitz 2006;
Wilson 2010), which was the endpoint in most of the trials. How-
ever, even though Chanoine 2005 had a 12-month follow-up, we
only had data available at six months from baseline. Wilson 2010
provided data at 100 weeks’ follow-up but we did not include these
in the meta-analysis.
The summary estimate across all pharmacological interventions
versus all comparators (metformin, orlistat or sibutramine mostly
versus placebo - usually combined with behaviour changing inter-
ventions) showed a MD in BMI change of -1.3 kg/m2 (95% CI
-1.9 to -0.8; P < 0.00001; 16 trials; 1884 participants; low cer-
tainty evidence - Analysis 1.1) in favour of the drug interventions.
Heterogeneity was considerable (I2 = 77%).
In Wilson 2010, which reported a BMI change at 100 weeks from
baseline (48 weeks of metformin or placebo treatment, then a
48-week drug-free period), the metformin group increased their
BMI during the drug-free period (+0.5) while the placebo group
decreased their BMI (-0.8), measured as the difference between
52 and 100 weeks from baseline. In the metformin plus fluoxetine
trial, the fluoxetine only group had a decrease in BMI of -0.6 (SD
0.1) and the metformin plus fluoxetine group had a decrease in
BMI of -0.9 (SD 0.02), compared to an increase of 0.2 (SD 0.04)
in the placebo group at 24 weeks from baseline.
Only 11 trials reported weight data at baseline or follow-up (or
change from baseline) in their publications; hence, we only in-
cluded these trials in the meta-analysis. Data were reported at
six months from baseline apart from one trial (Berkowitz 2006),
which reported the change in weight at 12 months from baseline.
The summary estimate across all pharmacological interventions
versuscomparators(metformin, orlistatorsibutramine mostlyver-
sus placebo - usually combined with behaviour changing inter-
ventions) showed an MD in change in weight of -3.9 kg (95% CI
-5.9 to -1.9; P < 0.00001; 11 trials; 1180 participants; low cer-
tainty evidence - Analysis 2.1) in favour of the drug interventions.
Heterogeneity was considerable (I2 = 79%).
Adverse events
Only three trials had sufficiently long exposure times to evaluate
adverse events possibly associated with drug interventions for obe-
sity in children and adolescents: one trial with 39 participants ran-
domised to metformin treatment for 100 weeks (Wilson 2010),
one trial with 368 participants randomised to sibutramine treat-
ment for 12 months (Berkowitz 2006), and one trial with 357 par-
ticipants randomised to orlistat treatment for 54 weeks (Chanoine
2005).
Adverse events were reported to have occurred in all 11 metformin
trials except from Clarson 2009, which reported that metformin
was well tolerated, and the author clarified no adverse events oc-
curred. Gastrointestinal adverse events were most commonly re-
ported with one metformin trial reporting that gastrointestinal
adverse events were statistically more prevalent in the intervention
group compared to the control group (Yanovski 2011). However,
Wiegand 2010 reported such events occurred more frequently in
the placebo group. Kendall 2013 reported adverse events were
more common in the metformin group and were mainly gastroin-
testinal. Atabek 2008 reported that two metformin-treated partic-
ipants experienced diarrhoea, mild abdominal pain/discomfort, or
both. Freemark 2001 also reported three participants experienced
transient abdominal discomfort or diarrhoea, however so did one
placebo participant. Wilson 2010 reported that the most com-
mon adverse events included headache, nausea, vomiting, upper
respiratory tract infection and musculoskeletal complaints; how-
ever, none were statistically different between the metformin and
placebo groups. One trial showed the fatigue was more common
21

 in the metformin-treated children (Yanovski 2011). Furthermore,
Freemark 2001 reported one case of an exacerbation of migraine
and one case of transient nausea in the metformin arm. Nausea
was reported in the Srinivasan 2006 trial where two participants
were unable to tolerate a higher dose of metformin (1 g); however,
they tolerated a lower dose and continued in the trial. Yanovski
2011 also reported that levels of serum vitamin B12 were reduced
in the metformin group compared with an increase in the placebo
group - this difference was statistically significant. Rezvanian 2010
reported two cases of headache, two cases of abdominal pain and
three cases of loose stools in the metformin arm but they were
all minor and tolerable. Mauras 2012 reported metformin was
well tolerated and safe, and the author added that the adverse ef-
fects between groups were comparable. Prado 2012 reported met-
formin was well tolerated by participants and both groups showed
a significant increase in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate
transaminase (AST), and a reduction in haemoglobin levels, but
these were within the normal ranges.
Three of six trials on sibutramine therapy reported on adverse
events: one large trial showed tachycardia, dry mouth, constipa-
tion, dizziness, insomnia and hypertension were all reported more
frequently by sibutramine participants than by placebo partici-
pants (Berkowitz 2006). Sibutramine-treated participants also had
a higher blood pressure and pulse rate at 12 months’ follow-up
compared to the placebo-treated participants (Berkowitz 2006).
However, another trial reported that there was no statistically sig-
nificant difference between changes in heart rate or blood pressure
between the sibutramine and placebo groups, although abdominal
cramps were significantly higher in the sibutramine group (Van
Mil 2007). Godoy-Matos 2005 showed constipation was signifi-
cantly higher in the sibutramine group compared to the placebo
group.
All four orlistat trials reported on adverse events: gastrointestinal
problems such as fatty stools, oily spotting and fecal urgency, along
with headaches and upper respiratory tract infections, were the
most common adverse effects. In the NCT00001723 trial, the
prevalence of some gastrointestinal problems was higher in the
orlistat group compared to the placebo group and this included:
fatty-appearing stools, bloating/gas, frequent urge for bowel move-
ment and uncontrolled passage of stool or oil. Chanoine 2005 re-
ported that gastrointestinal tract-related adverse events were more
common in the orlistat group compared to the placebo group;
however, most were classed as mild to moderate intensity. Maahs
2006 also reported that the orlistat group had significantly in-
creased gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. soft stools, oily spot-
ting) compared to the placebo group. Mild gastrointestinal com-
plaints (frequent stools) were experienced by all orlistat-receiving
participants in the Ozkan 2004 trial. Chanoine 2005 also reported
that 10 orlistat and one placebo participant showed abnormalities
detected on electrocardiograms; however, an independent cardi-
ologist concluded that none were connected to the treatment; in
addition, levels of oestradiol in girls decreased in the orlistat group
versus a slight increase in the placebo group (P = 0.05). Symp-
tomatic gallstones were also seen in six orlistat participants which
were not seen at baseline (five of these participants had lost large
amounts of weight).
In the trial which included a fluoxetine arm, there were five adverse
events with regards to the drug which included three cases of dry
mouth and two cases of loose stool; these were all considered as
minor and tolerable, and reported as transient (Rezvanian 2010).
Serious/severe adverse events were also investigated: most trials
did not report how they defined a serious/severe adverse event.
It was also unclear in four trials whether a serious/severe adverse
event actually occurred (Berkowitz 2003; Ozkan 2004; Van Mil
2007; Wiegand 2010). Only five trials reported that a serious or
severe adverse event occurred (Berkowitz 2006; Chanoine 2005;
Maahs 2006; NCT00001723; Wilson 2010); the remaining 12
trials reported that there were no serious or severe adverse events.
Across all trials the RR for serious adverse events comparing drug
interventions with comparators was 1.43 (95% CI 0.63 to 3.25; P
= 0.39; 5 trials; 1347 participants; low certainty evidence - Analysis
3.1). Absolute numbers experiencing a serious adverse event were
24/878 (2.7%) participants in the drug intervention groups versus
8/469 (1.7%) participants in the comparator groups.
In the metformin trials, only one trial reported that there were se-
rious adverse events and these included one case of appendectomy
and one case of leg vein thrombosis in the metformin group, but
these were both seen as unrelated to the drug (Wilson 2010). One
sibutramine trial reported that 2.7% of sibutramine-treated par-
ticipants experienced serious adverse events which included one
case of excessive nausea and vomiting, one suicide attempt and
five depression cases (Berkowitz 2006). The placebo group had
one case of suicide attempt and one case of depression. Chanoine
2005 reported 3% of participants experienced at least one serious
adverse event: the five events in the placebo group included acute
demyelinating encephalomyelitis, facial palsy, pneumonia, wors-
ening of asthma and pain in the right side; and the 11 events in
the orlistat group included pilonidal abscess, depression, asthma
attack, seizure, admission for repair of deviated nasal septum, ap-
pendicitis, cholelithiasis, gallbladder disorder followed by chole-
cystectomy, adenoidal hypertrophy and aseptic meningitis. It was
only the case of cholelithiasis in the orlistat participant which was
seen to be possibly related to the trial medication potentially due
to rapid weight loss. Another orlistat trial reported two serious
adverse events in the placebo group and these were one case of
hypoglycaemia and one case of left lower quadrant pain and vom-
iting (NCT00001723).
In the sibutramine trials, 32 participants (24 in the intervention
groups and eight in the control groups) left the trial because of
adverse events. Berkowitz 2006 reported that withdrawals due to
tachycardia were similar in both groups but hypertension led to
the withdrawal of five participants in the sibutramine group versus
none in the placebo group. Two cases of attempted suicide (one
intervention and one placebo) also led to discontinuation but were
22

 considered unlikely to be related to the trial drug; one case of
excessive nausea and vomiting in the sibutramine group also led to
withdrawal and may have been related to the drug. Van Mil 2007
had one withdrawal from the sibutramine group due to symptoms
of clinical depression and Berkowitz 2003 had one withdrawal
from the placebo group.
In the metformin trials, nine participants withdrew due to adverse
events (five in intervention group and four in placebo group).
Wilson 2010 reported one participant from the metformin group
withdrew due to nausea which was probably related to the drug,
andafurthertwometforminandone placeboparticipantsdropped
out of the trial due to elevated levels of ALT. Gastrointestinal
symptoms caused 6% of participants (one in metformin group
and three in placebo group) to drop out of the Wiegand 2010 trial.
In addition, Yanovski 2011 reported one participant dropped out
of the metformin group due to medication intolerance.
Across all trials the RR for discontinuing the trial because of ad-
verse events comparing drug interventions with comparators was
1.45 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.52; P = 0.19; 10 trials; 1664 participants;
low certainty evidence - Analysis 3.2). Absolute numbers discon-
tinuing the trial because of an adverse event were 52/1043 (5.0%)
participants in the drug intervention groups versus 17/621 (2.7%)
participants in the comparator groups.
All four orlistat trials had dropouts due to adverse events; 28 par-
ticipants (23 in the intervention group and five in the placebo
group). Chanoine 2005 reported 12 dropouts (3%) in the orlis-
tat group and three dropouts (2%) in the placebo group, mainly
due to gastrointestinal adverse events. Ozkan 2004 reported seven
participants (32%) dropped out of the orlistat group due to gas-
trointestinal complaints. Maahs 2006 reported two participants in
the orlistat group discontinued due to adverse events (assumed to
be gastrointestinal) and one participant in the orlistat group com-
mitted suicide. NCT00001723 reported one participant in the
orlistat group and two participants in the placebo group dropped
out of the trial due to medication intolerance.

11.
Secondary outcomes
Health-related quality of life
Two trials measured health-related quality of life; the certainty
of the evidence was very low. García-Morales 2006 used the 36-
Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and found
changes in the total score were slightly higher in the sibutramine
group compared to the placebo group, but this difference was
not statistically significant. Maahs 2006 used three questionnaires
to assess health-related quality of life, but found no statistically
significant differences between the orlistat and placebo group from
baseline to six months. For further details on the health-related
quality of life measurements, see Appendix 14.
Body fat distribution
Eighteen trials reported outcomes which measured body fat dis-
tribution. Fifteen of these trials measured waist, hip, or both cir-
cumferences at baseline and follow-up. In the metformin trials,
Mauras 2012 found greater decreases in waist circumference in
the metformin plus diet plus exercise group compared with the
diet plus exercise group at six months’ follow-up. However, this
trial was not placebo controlled. In addition, Srinivasan 2006,
a cross-over trial, reported a beneficial treatment effect on waist
circumference in participants taking metformin for six months,
when compared to six months of placebo. However, there was
no statistically significant difference in waist circumference be-
tween the drug and control groups in Clarson 2009 and Prado
2012 trials at six months’ follow-up. Wilson 2010 measured waist
circumference but did not report results. Two metformin trials
also measured waist-to-hip ratio and found no statistically signifi-
cant difference between groups at six months’ follow-up (Kendall
2013; Wiegand 2010). Yanovski 2011 also measured abdominal
and hip circumference at six months’ follow-up, and found a sta-
tistically significant difference between metformin and placebo, in
favour of the intervention. In the metformin plus fluoxetine trial,
only the metformin plus fluoxetine arm had a statistically signifi-
cant between-group difference in waist circumference at 24 weeks
from baseline (Rezvanian 2010). In the sibutramine trials, there
was a statistically significant difference in waist circumference in
favour of the intervention in five trials (Berkowitz 2003; Berkowitz
2006; Franco 2014; García-Morales 2006; Godoy-Matos 2005).
Godoy-Matos 2005 also reported a statistically significant reduc-
tion in hip circumference in the sibutramine group compared to
the placebo group; however, there was no statistically significant
difference for waist-to-hip ratio at six months. Only one orlistat
trial measured waist circumference and found it increased in the
placebo group but decreased in the orlistat group at one year’ fol-
low-up (difference statistically significant); this was also seen for
hip circumference (Chanoine 2005).
Seven trials measured body composition by DEXA. Four met-
formintrialsandtwoorlistattrialsmeasuredbody fatusing DEXA.
Three metformin trials found no statistically significant difference
between groups in the percentage of body fat lost (Mauras 2012;
Srinivasan 2006; Wilson 2010). However, one trial observed a sta-
tistically significant difference of 1.4 kg between the metformin
and placebo groups, in favour of the intervention group at six
months’ follow-up (Yanovski 2011). One sibutramine trial as-
sessed body composition using underwater weighing and DEXA;
however, there was no statistically significant difference in per-
centage of fat mass between groups. Chanoine 2005 reported they
measured fat mass by DEXA in a subgroup of participants as a
safety measure and the orlistat group lost more fat mass compared
to the placebo group (P = 0.03). NCT00001723 found a slightly
greater decrease in body fat (kg) in the orlistat group compared
to the placebo group. Two trials estimated fat mass from bioim-
pedence analysis: one orlistat trial (Maahs 2006) and one met-

 formin trial (Wiegand 2010), but they reported no statistically
significant difference between intervention and placebo groups.
Yanovski 2011 measured fat mass by air displacement plethysmog-
raphy and found metformin participants had statistically signifi-
cant decreases in their fat mass compared to placebo participants;
they also measured intra-abdominal fat by magnetic resonance
imaging but found no statistically significant difference between
groups. Srinivasan 2006 also used magnetic resonance imaging
and found a beneficial treatment effect of metformin over placebo
for subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue but not visceral ab-
dominal adipose tissue; Mauras 2012 also used this technique and
found that intrahepatic fat only decreased in the nonplacebo con-
trol group. Wiegand 2010 used abdominal computer tomography
(CT) scans to evaluate abdominal fat content but also found no
statistically significant difference between metformin and placebo
participants in the results.
Behaviour change
Six trials measured behaviour change; however, only two trials re-
ported the results. Participants in three trials all completed a food
frequency questionnaire at the beginning and end of the trial;
however, no results were presented (Atabek 2008; García-Morales
2006; Maahs 2006). Kendall 2013 assessed dietary habits and ex-
ercise levels through three previously validated questionnaires but
were unable to analyse the data due to insufficient resources. Van
Mil 2007 measured total energy expenditure, using the Maastricht
protocol and included data from a seven-day dietary record; how-
ever, the difference between the sibutramine and control groups af-
ter 12 weeks of intervention was not statistically significant. Physi-
cal activity level was also measured using an activity questionnaire,
but there was no statistically significant difference between groups
at 12 weeks. Changes in total energy expenditure and physical ac-
tivity levels were not measured at 24-week follow-up due to un-
availability of equipment.
Participants’ views of the intervention
No trials investigated participants’ views of the intervention.
Morbidity
Only one trial investigated morbidity defined as illness or harm
associated with the intervention (Chanoine 2005). In the orlistat
group, 6/352 (1.7%) participants developed new gallstones com-
pared with 1/181 (0.6%) in the placebo group. The certainty of
the evidence was very low.
Some trials investigated various risk indicators, mainly insulin re-
sistance orinsulinsensitivityandhyperinsulinaemia(Atabek 2008;
Clarson 2009; Freemark 2001; Kendall 2013; Srinivasan 2006;
Wiegand 2010; Yanovski 2011). García-Morales 2006 investi-
gated changes in blood pressure, glucose and triglycerides. Prado
2012 investigated glycaemia, insulin resistance and lipid profiles.
Mauras 2012 investigated changes in hsCRP and fibrogen con-
centrations.
All-cause mortality
One trial reported a death from suicide (Maahs 2006); the cer-
tainty of evidence was low. The authors reported that quality of
life factors were screened extensively and the participant gave neg-
ative responses to quality of life questions specific to suicide and
was also under the care of a psychiatrist for depression at the time
of the trial. Berkowitz 2006 reported two suicide attempts (one in
the intervention group and one in the placebo group).
Socioeconomic effects
No trials investigated socioeconomic effects.
For a summary of all outcomes assessed in each trial, see Appendix
5. For further explanation on how trial outcomes were defined,
see Appendix 7 and Appendix 8.
Subgroup analyses
We performed subgroup analyses on our primary outcomes of
BMI and weight. In our protocol, we specified we would analyse
length of follow-up; however, only two trials provided data at a
time point greater than six months. There was too much hetero-
geneity to analyse the maintenance periods and most trials ended
on completion of the intervention. In addition, there were only
two trials which did not use a placebo; hence, we did not per-
form subgroup analyses based on type of control given. However,
we performed subgroup analyses on BMI for the following fac-
tors: drug type (Analysis 1.2), dropout rates (Analysis 1.3), ITT
analysis (Analysis 1.4), funding source (Analysis 1.5), publication
date (Analysis 1.6), quality of trial (Analysis 1.7), country income
(Analysis 1.8), and mean age of participants (Analysis 1.9).
Only two interaction tests for subgroup differences indicated sta-
tistically significant differences.
Comparing dropout rates less than 20% showed an MD in BMI
change of -1.1 kg/m2 (95% CI -1.8 to -0.4; 9 trials), with dropout
rates 20% or greater showed an MD in BMI change of -1.4 kg/m
2 (95% CI -2.3 to -0.5; 6 trials), and with unclear dropout rates
showed an MD in BMI change of -2.7 kg/m2 (95% CI -3.7 to -
1.7; 1 trial). The P value for interaction was 0.03 and heterogeneity
was substantial (I2 = 71%).
Comparing middle-income countries with high-income countries
showed an MD in BMI change of -2.4 kg/m2 (95% CI -3.1 to -1.7;
3 trials) versus -1.1 kg/m2 (95% CI -1.6 to -0.6; 13 trials). The P
value for interaction was 0.004 and heterogeneity was considerable
(I2 = 88%).
For the outcome measure change in weight, only drug type could
be used for a subgroup analysis and the interaction test for sub-
group differences was not statistically significant (P = 0.52, I2 =
0%).

 We also explored the effects of participant sex on the BMI point
estimate, using a meta-regression model in CMA. The proportion
of boys at follow-up (or baseline if not reported) in each study was
selected as a covariate. We found that the coefficient of determina-
tion (r2) from this model was zero. The 95% CI for the meta-re-
gression slope was extremely wide either side of zero (-6.3 to 4.1).
We noted that some study authors only reported the percentage
of boys and girls in the total sample at baseline and not at follow-
up.
Sensitivity analyses
Table 2 shows the sensitivity analyses on BMI change. Our first
analysis removed the trials which only reported pre- and post-BMI
(not change scores) (Kendall 2013; Wiegand 2010), and hence re-
quired the use of a correlation coefficient of 0.78 (Bayer 2011) to
predict the point estimates. This made very little difference in the
point estimate. Only two trials had larger sample sizes (Berkowitz
2006; Chanoine 2005); however, when we removed these trials
from the meta-analysis the point estimate did not change. Fur-
thermore, all trials in the meta-analysis were published and were
in English; hence, we could not perform a sensitivity analysis on
these criteria. However, we performed a sensitivity analysis with
allocation bias, blinding bias (participant and trial personnel, and
assessor) and attrition bias by removing the high risk or unclear
risk trials, and did not find substantial differences. This was also
the case when we removed trials with higher drug dose and 12
months’ follow-up, as well as when we removed the trials with an
active lifestyle intervention.
We performed similar analyses for weight change (Table 3). We re-
moved trials which did not report change in weight (Atabek 2008;
Kendall 2013; Maahs 2006), and this resulted in a slightly greater
reduction in the point estimate. We used the same correlation co-
efficient to calculate the mean change in weight (in the interven-
tion and comparator groups) as we did for the BMI outcome (r
= 0.78), although we were able to calculate an exact correlation
coefficient in one trial (Maahs 2006) by using their reported BMI
at baseline, follow-up and change score (r = 0.975). Reductions
in point estimates increased slightly when we removed trials with
blinding (participant and trial personnel, and assessor) and attri-
tion bias. This also occurred when we restricted the analysis to
trials which also included a high-dose behaviour change interven-
tion. In the sensitivity analyses where we removed trials with high
allocation concealment bias, high drug dose, large sample size or
follow-up greater than six months, point estimate reductions were
slightly less than in the original analysis.
Assessment of reporting bias
We drew a funnel plot in CMA version 3 and Review Manager
5 for change in BMI as there was a sufficient number of trials
(16) (Figure 4). The Egger’s regression intercept was -0.75 (95%
CI -3.2 to 1.7; P = 0.52); this suggests there was no evidence of
reporting bias.

Ongoing trials
We found eight ongoing RCTs with four receiving met-
formin in the intervention group (EUCTR2010-023061-21;
NCT00889876; NCT01677923; NCT02274948), two receiving
topiramate (NCT01859013; NCT02273804), and two receiving
exenatide (EUCTR2015-001628-45-SE; NCT02496611). Three
trials, originally identified as ongoing, have been moved into the
’awaiting classification’ section because the trial has been com-
pleted but no results are available on the clinical trial website
or through a publication (ISRCTN08063839; NCT00934570;
NCT00940628). In addition, one trial which was originally clas-
sified as ongoing was moved to the ’awaiting classification’ sec-
tion because during the final stages of conducting the review we
identified a new publication (via the MEDLINE email alert ser-
vice), which included results from 18-month follow-up (van der
Aa 2016, see NCT01487993 for a summary of the results). Results
from this trial will be incorporated in the next update of the review.
For two trials, we were unable to locate the source (Golebiowska
1981; Linquette 1971). In addition, we identified one confer-
ence abstract (Pastor 2014a, see EUCTR2010-023061-21) and
one conference poster (Smetanina 2015). We attempted to con-
tact both authors but only received a reply from Smetanina 2015,
who confirmed the trial had been completed but these data were
still being analysed.

Summary of main results
We included 21 published RCTs and eight ongoing RCTs in this
review. The included trials evaluated metformin (11 trials), sibu-
tramine (six trials), orlistat (four trials), and one trial arm investi-
gating the combination of metformin plus fluoxetine. The ongo-
ing trials included four metformin, two topiramate and two exe-
natide trials. There were 2484 participants in the included trials,
1478 participants were randomised to drug intervention groups
and 904 to comparator groups. All trials but three used a placebo
in the comparator group. Two trials had a cross-over design while
the remaining 19 trials were parallel RCTs. The length of the inter-
vention period ranged from 12 weeks to 48 weeks, and the length
of follow-up from baseline ranged from six months to 100 weeks.

 Overall there were small reductions in BMI (MD -1.3, 95% CI -
1.9 to -0.8) and bodyweight change (MD -3.9 kg. 95% CI -5.9 to
-1.9) in favour of the drug interventions. Five trials reported se-
rious adverse events (24/878 (2.7%) participants in the interven-
tion groups versus 8/469 (1.7%) participants in the comparator
groups; RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.25; 1347 participants; low cer-
tainty evidence). A total of 52/1043 (5.0%) participants in the in-
tervention groups versus 17/621 (2.7%) in the comparator groups
discontinued the trial because of adverse events (RR 1.45, 95% CI
0.83 to 2.52; 10 trials; 1664 participants; low certainty evidence).
The most common adverse events in orlistat and metformin tri-
als were gastrointestinal. Common adverse effects in sibutramine
trials included tachycardia, constipation and hypertension. The
fluoxetine trial reported dry mouth and loose stools. One trials re-
ported health-related quality of life showing no marked differences
between intervention and comparator. No trial reported the par-
ticipants’ views of the intervention or socioeconomic effects. Only
one trial reported on morbidity associated with the intervention
where there were more gallstones after the orlistat treatment. Trial
authors reported one suicide in one of the orlistat intervention
groups. However, the trials were not sufficiently long to investigate
all-cause mortality reliably. No trial investigated drug treatment
for overweight children.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
We faced problems in meta-analysing BMI as some trials did not
report the raw data we required; therefore, we had to try and obtain
this from the trial authors. In addition, age and sex are usually
taken into account when measuring the weight status of a child
because they are growing. However, in this review, we only assessed
changes in raw BMI because previous research has shown short-
term changes in adiposity are best represented by changes in raw
BMI units compared to BMI z scores or BMI centiles (Cole 2005;
Kakinami 2014). Furthermore, only 10 trials reported changes in
BMI z scores; therefore, we thought it was more appropriate to
only meta-analyse raw BMI, then this change could be converted
into change in BMI z score (using the desired growth reference) -
which we have done in the conclusion section of this review.
All 21 trials measured adverse events; however, some trials reported
the total number of participants who experienced at least one ad-
verse event whilst others only reported the number of specific ad-
verse events. Hence, we also had to attempt to obtain this infor-
mation from the trial authors. Of the six trials which measured
behaviour change, only two trials reported the results at follow-
up. Only two trials reported health-related quality of life and they
used different methods. Hence, more trials are needed to investi-
gate how drugs used to treat obesity affect the participants’ health-
related quality of life. No trials reported differences in participant
views or socioeconomic effects.
Quality of the evidence
Based on the GRADE criteria, we rated the outcomes BMI, body
weight, all-cause mortality and adverse events as low. We down-
graded the levels of evidence because of potential other risk of bias
or reporting bias, inconsistency and imprecision. We rated health-
related quality of life and morbidity as very low certainty evidence,
mainly because of the small number of participants, one trial only
and imprecision.
Potential biases in the review process
We decided to perform unplanned subgroup analyses looking at
funding and country as there were enough trials to divide them
into groups. We were unable to analyse length of follow-up, im-
pact of maintenance periods and type of control group in the sub-
group analyses as there were too few trials or too much hetero-
geneity. The meta-analyses for BMI and weight included trials
which differed in follow-up length, behavioural interventions and
drug dose. However, when sensitivity analyses were performed,
the changes in point estimates were small.
We did not restrict our search strategy to any date, hence we have
sifted through trials ranging back to the 1960s. However, we did
not undertake any searches of the grey literature. We had some cor-
respondence with most of trial authors, and some have supplied us
with additional information including raw BMI data. Only seven
trials gave clinical trial identifiers or protocols available; hence, it
was difficult to assess whether reporting bias occurred. However,
from the trials where a protocol/clinical trial entry was available,
there was little evidence to suggest a source of reporting bias. We
excluded a large number of trials because of follow-up times less
than six months, especially older trials, and this may have im-
pacted on the overall findings from this review. In addition, we
had difficulties calculating the number of adverse events in each
trial due to different reporting metrics; for example, some trials
reported the total number of adverse events in each group whilst
others reported the total number of participants who suffered at
least one adverse event. Despite our attempts to contact authors
for additional information, we were still unable to meta-analyse
most of these findings.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Since the previous review (Oude Luttikhuis 2009), we identified
one new orlistat trial; however, the reduction in BMI was similar
to what was found previously. The reduction in BMI for the sibu-
tramine trials found in this review was smaller than the change
reported in the previous review; however, these data still favour the
intervention. This difference is likely to be due to the inclusion of
three extra sibutramine trials in the meta-analysis. The previous
review did not include a meta-analysis of metformin trials.

 Another review and meta-analysis of the effect of orlistat and sibu-
tramine on adolescent weight loss derived a difference in BMI of
-2.3 kg/m2 for sibutramine (95% CI -2.9 to -1.8; 5 trials; 770
participants) and -1.7 kg/m2 for orlistat (95% CI -3.5 to 0.2; 3
trials; 621 participants) (Czernichow 2010). These point estimates
reductions are greater than the ones derived in our review. How-
ever, the orlistat point estimate in the Czernichow 2010 review
includes the Ozkan 2004 trial with a large BMI weight reduction
which we excluded from the meta-analysis in our review for not
having a common follow-up time across participants. In addition,
the sibutramine analysis included data from a secondary analysis
of white and African-American participants from Berkowitz 2003
which may explain why the point estimate was different. In an
earlier review, there was an MD of -0.7 kg/m2 (95% CI -1.2 to -
0.3) in orlistat participants compared to placebo, which is consis-
tent with our findings (McGovern 2008). There was a reduction
of -2.4 kg/m2 (95% CI -3.1 to -1.8) in sibutramine trials, which
is higher than the reduction we found (McGovern 2008). There
were similar findings also found in another meta-analysis where
the reduction for sibutramine was an MD of -2.2 kg/m2 (95%
CI -2.8 to -1.6; 4 trials; 686 participants) and the reduction for
orlistat was an MD of -0.8 (95% CI -1.2 to -0.5; 2 trials; 573
participants) (Viner 2010).
In metformin trials, McDonagh 2014 determined an effect size
of an MD of -1.2 kg/m2 (95% CI -1.6 to -0.7; 13 trials), which
is similar to the point estimate found in this review. In addition,
Bouza 2012 found a reduction of a MD of -1.2 kg/m2 (95% CI
-1.8 to -0.5; 7 trials), in favour of metformin. An earlier review
found a reduction of -1.4 kg/m2 (95% CI -2 to -0.8; 5 trials; 320
participants) in metformin trials (Park 2009); however, the review
only included five trials and we excluded one of the trials in this
review (Love-Osborne 2008).
Overall findings from meta-analyses of metformin, sibutramine
and orlistat trials are similar to the ones presented in this review,
and reasons for any differences are likely to derive from different
inclusion criteria and our inclusion of more recent trials.

Implications for practice
This systematic review highlights the paucity of both the avail-
ability of reliable pharmacotherapy options for the treatment of
obese children and adolescents, and the clinical trial evidence to
support efficacy and safety. Trial quality and reporting overall was
poor, with high dropout and discontinuation rates. Many of the
trials assessed the efficacy of drugs which have now been with-
drawn (sibutramine) or are not recommended for obesity treat-
ment (metformin) in many countries.
In this review, we found an overall reduction in body mass index
(BMI) of 1.3 kg/m2 in favour of the drug interventions. Using
the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) BMI cut-offs for
overweight and obesity (Cole 2012), a 12-year-old boy would
have a cut-off of 21.2 kg/m2 for being overweight, 26.02 kg/m
2 for being obese and 31.21 kg/m2 for being morbidly obesity.
Therefore, it would be possible for a 12-year-old boy who reduces
his BMI by 1.3 kg/m2 to move down a weight status category -
but only if they happen to lie just above the cut-off points. This is
also similar for girls and older children. In terms of a standardised
meandifference (SMD),the reductioninBMIfoundinthis review
would equate to a reduction of 0.28 between-individuals standard
deviation scores.
Whilst this finding suggests that drug interventions can result in
a small BMI and weight reduction over the short term, it is not
known whether this is:
• sustainable over the longer term, which is an important
consideration given evidence from the pharmacological
management of adult obesity demonstrating a need for
continued medication to maintain weight loss (Yanovski 2014),
that is, drug withdrawal is followed by weight regain, which
occurred in Rezvanian 2010, Van Mil 2007, and Wilson 2010
during the drug-free follow-up.
• has any impact on existing or future clinical risk factors or
disease. Additionally, though all trials reported adverse events,
quantitative data were only available in the minority of the
included trials. This is particularly important as none of the
included trials collected data on participants’ views.
Implications for research
As new pharmacotherapies for the treatment of adult obesity be-
come available (phentermine plus topiramate extended release; li-
raglutide 3.0 mg; bupropion plus naltrexone; lorcaserin), there
may be a demand for an evaluation of their efficacy within an
obese paediatric population. The requirement of regulatory au-
thorities (US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Euro-
pean Medicines Agency (EMA)) for trials of all new medications
to be used in children and adolescents should drive more and bet-
ter trials. Hence, any future trials should ensure they are evaluated
over the longer term (i.e. longer than one year) and collect data
on cardiovascular and metabolic parameters, morbidities, health-
related quality of life, social and psychological well-being, diet
and physical activity behaviours, participant views and socioeco-
nomic effects. It is also important that new trials’ protocols reduce
all possible sources of bias and provide accurate interpretation of
findings, by ensuring power calculations and intention-to-treat
analyses are described and conducted, and robust sequence allo-
cation, allocation concealment methods and blinding measures
are used and comprehensively described. All new trial protocols
should also be registered and published to ensure reporting bias
can be assessed. There should also be standardisation in report-
ing to ensure all trials report a raw BMI score and adverse events

 per participant. As evidence from adult weight management indi-
cates the intensity of adjunctive lifestyle interventions can impact
on weight loss and associated outcomes, future trials should aim
to ensure they maximise and adequately report any concomitant
behaviour changing programme. Participant retention is also an
issue that needs addressing with improved and novel mechanisms
to reduce dropout rates and ensure treatment concordance. Since
overweight and obesity is developing at an increasingly early age,
future evaluation and trials may need to consider recruiting young,
prepubertal participants in whom clearly high levels of safety will
need to be established.

rationale for the size of intervention group
and no calculation of power. They also do
not declare who funded the trial

Methods
Type of trial: interventional; randomised controlled trial
Allocation: randomised
Intervention model: parallel assignment
Masking: not reported
Primary purpose: treatment
Participants
Condition: adolescent obesity
Enrolment: target 48
Inclusion criteria:
• aged 12 to 18 years
• BMI > 95th centile for age and sex
• pubertal stage ≥ 3
• ability for parent and child to read and understand written instructions in English; parents able to
give informed written consent in English; adolescent able to give verbal assent
• successfully completed a 6-month lifestyle intervention without a gain in BMI z-score
Exclusion criteria:
• renal disorders, diabetes, diagnosed psychological disorders
• taking stimulants or psychotropic medication or drugs known to alter metabolism including insulin
sensitisers, glucocorticoids, thyroxine, other weight loss medications
• taking any drugs known to be contraindicated with metformin therapy
• known adverse reactions to metformin
• pregnancy
Interventions
Intervention: metformin + lifestyle intervention
Comparator: placebo + lifestyle intervention
Outcomes
Primary outcome:
• BMI (pre and post intervention)
Secondary outcomes:
• subjective appetite sensations using a novel electronic appetite rating system (EARS), immediately
before and then hourly for 4 hours after a fixed-energy breakfast. Measured at baseline, day 1, week 2,
week 4, then monthly. This is a validated technique of measuring appetite which has been used in
appetite trials involving obese children
• food preferences will be measured using a novel ’liking and wanting’ (L&W) experimental
procedure. Measured at baseline, day 1, week 2, week 4, then monthly. This method has been validated
in several trials. The L&W procedure is sensitive to detect changes in nutrient and taste preferences
• we will measure fasting gastrointestinal hormones (at baseline, day 28, 2 months and 6 months) to
identify potential biomarkers which could explain any differences in appetite responses between the 2
groups. These will be correlated with fasting and postprandial subjective appetite sensations
• in a subset of participants (10 in each group), will measure gastrointestinal hormones and subjective
sensations of appetite, pre- and postprandially (by insertion of an intravenous cannula) and pre- and
postdosing with metformin (at baseline, each metformin dose increment (day 1, week 2, week 4), 2
months and 6 months)

Notes
The trial was sponsored by St. Antonius Hospital; Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis is a collaborator on the trial;
the health authority associated to this trial is ”Netherlands: The Central Committee on Research Involving
Human Subjects (CCMO)“
Results of trial are now published (see Van der Aa 2016 - NCT01487993): 62 participants randomised
(32 metformin, 30 placebo), 42 analysed (23 metformin, 19 placebo); 18 months’ intervention; median
change in BMI was +0.2 kg/m2 (95% CI -2.9 to 1.3) (metformin) versus +1.2 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.3 to 2.4)
kg/m2 (placebo) (P = 0.02). No serious adverse events reported. 2 out of 9 participants lost to follow-up in

Notes
Project supported by Research Council of Lithuania (grant Nr MIP-039/2013) and Research Foundation
of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (grants 2012 and 2013)
Results: reduction in BMI, waist circumference and waist circumference SDS adjusted by sex and puberty
stages was significantly greater in the metformin + lifestyle changes group compared to the controls no
treatment group. Change in BMI after 12 months’ intervention: controls = +0.18 kg/m2, lifestyle changes
only = +0.43 kg/m2, metformin only = -0.59 kg/m2, metformin + lifestyle changes = -1.07 kg/m2. Change
in waist circumference after 12 months’ intervention: controls = -1.8 cm, lifestyle changes only = -2.8 cm,
metformin only = -2.3 cm, metformin + lifestyle changes = -4.5 cm. Change in waist circumference SDS
after 12 months’ intervention: controls = -0.38, lifestyle changes only = -0.58, metformin only = -0.49,
metformin + lifestyle changes = -0.85. Initially, there were mild adverse effects with metformin (nausea,
diarrhoea) in 21.6% of participants from metformin only group and metformin + lifestyle changes group,
which disappeared within 1 week of metformin administration. Adjusted by sex and puberty status, lean
mass was significantly increased in lifestyle only group compared to controls no treatment and metformin

= +3.98 kg, metformin only = -0.36 kg, metformin + lifestyle changes = -0.37 kg. 12 months’ metformin
treatment with lifestyle modification was effective and safe method reducing BMI and waist circumference
in overweight/obese children and adolescents, superior to that of lifestyle changes alone

Official title
Enhancing Weight Loss Maintenance with GLP-1RA (BYDUREON™) in Adolescents with Severe Obe-
sity
Stated purpose of study
Primary objective: evaluate the effect of GLP-1RA treatment on the maintenance of weight loss and
durability of cardiometabolic risk factor improvements among adolescents with severe obesity following a
meal replacement induction period
Secondary objectives: investigate the mechanisms by which glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists treat-
ment facilitates weight loss maintenance and identify predictors of response to treatment

(plus an open-label phase for additional 6 months)
Behavioural programme: in phase 1 (drug-placebo
phase) participants attended 13 weekly group ses-
sions while in phase 2 (drug, open label) group ses-
sions were held biweekly then monthly. Parents met
separately from participants. Instructed to consume
1200 kcal/d to 1500 kcal/d and to engage in 120 min
of walking or similar activity per week. Eating and
activity logs kept daily. Length = 12 months
Placebo: oral, 1 dose per day, (months 1 to 6), 6
months
Behavioural programme: same as intervention
group
Berkowitz 2006
Sibutramine: oral, 1 dose per day, 10 mg/d (baseline
to month 6), 15 mg/d from month 6 in participants
who had not lost more than 10% of their initial BMI,
12 months
Behavioural therapy programme: each individ-
ual centre implemented flexible lifestyle modifica-
tion approaches that were specific to participants’
needs. This included self-monitoring of eating habits
and physical activity, stress management, stimulus
control, problem solving, contingency management,
cognitive restructuring and social support. Partici-
pants were given counselling at each visit and nutri-
Placebo: oral, 1 dose per day, placebo (baseline to
month 6), uptitrated after 6 months in participants
who had not lost more than 10% of their initial BMI,

Chanoine 2005
Orlistat: oral, dose 3 times per day, 120 mg x 3 (360
mg)/d, 1 year
Behavioural therapy: participants were prescribed a
nutritionally balanced, hypocaloric diet and at each
trial visit the dietitian spoke about compliance. Be-
havioural modification involved techniques to limit
calorie and fat intake, eating more slowly, avoid-
ing snacks and avoiding overeating. Guidelines were
given to encourage regular physical activity and re-
duce sedentary behaviour; compliance was moni-
tored by a behavioural psychologist at each visit.
Length = 54 weeks
Placebo: oral, dose 3 times per day, 1 year
Behavioural therapy: same as intervention group
Clarson 2009
Metformin: oral, 3 times daily, 500 mg x 3 (1.5 g),
6 months
Behaviour changing intervention: monthly indi-
vidual visits and 2 group sessions. Fitness special-
ist supervised participants in an individual 30-min
exercise sessions every 2 months. Diet advice and
physical activity advice given. Progress monitored by
weekly telephone calls and monthly visits. Length =
6 months
No placebo (N/A)
Behaviour changing intervention: same as inter-
vention group
Franco 2014
Sibutramine: oral, once daily, 10 mg, 6 months
Dietary guidance:the dietaryguideline proposal was
of a low-calorie diet with restriction of 25% of the
total recommended calories for a teenager
Placebo: oral, once daily, 10 mg, 6 months
Dietary guidance: same as intervention group
Freemark 2001
Metformin: oral, 2 doses per day, 500 mg x 2 (1g)/

Garcia-Morales 2006
Sibutramine: oral, 1 dose per day, 10 mg/d, 6
months
Diet + exercise: diet and exercise advice was tai-
lored to each participant. Advice was given on recom-
mended food portions and possible combinations,
and all participants were advised to perform at least
30 min of aerobic physical activity per day. Each
participant also attended individual consultation ses-
sions with a registered paediatric nutritionist. A de-
tailed food consumption questionnaire was com-
pleted at the beginning and end of trial medication
period. Length = 6 months
Placebo: oral, 1 dose per day, 6 months

Godoy-Matos 2005
Sibutramine: oral, 1 dose per day, 10 mg/d, 6
months
Hypocaloric diet + exercise: participants were given
dietary counselling to achieve an energy deficit of 500
kcal/datthe startof the run-inphase (nofurthervisits
after). Physical activity instructions were delivered
by the attendant doctors in a brief written protocol
aimed to obtain mainly aerobic moderate exercises
for at least 30 min/d. A lifestyle intervention was not
given during 6-month trial

Metformin: oral, twice daily, 500 mg x 2 + 500 mg
(1.5 g), 6 months
Healthy lifestyle advice: participants provided with
a standardised healthy lifestyle advice at the start in a
1-to-1 sessions, including a healthy diet advice sheet
and increased levels of exercise (available upon re-
quest). A lifestyle intervention was not given during
the 6-month trial
Placebo: oral, twice daily, 2 + 1 (3) tablets/d, 6
months
Healthy lifestyle advice : same as intervention group
Maahs 2006
Orlistat: oral, 3 doses per day, 120 mg x 3 (360 mg)
/d, 6 months
Diet + exercise therapy: the goal caloric intake was
calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation with
ambulating activity factor (500 calories was sub-
tracted from the final number to obtain daily calorie
level). Participants were instructed to increase activ-
ity using a paediatric activity pyramid and encour-
aged to exercise for at least 30 min, 3 times per week.
Monthly follow-up visits with a dietitian reinforced

aQuestions on risk of bias are answered in relation to most of the aggregated evidence in the meta-analysis rather than to individual
studies.
bQuestions on inconsistency are primarily based on visual assessment of forest plots and the statistical quantification of heterogeneity
based on I2 statistic.
cWhen judging the width of the confidence interval it is recommended to use a clinical decision threshold to assess whether the
imprecision is clinically meaningful.
dQuestions address comprehensiveness of the search strategy, industry influence, funnel plot asymmetry and discrepancies between
published and unpublished trials.

New citation required and conclusions have changed
Given the rapid growth in the treatment of child and
adolescent obesity, we have split the original review (’In-
terventions for treating obesity in children and adoles-
cents’) into six separate reviews, with a specific inter-
vention and age focus
(1) Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interven-
tions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in ado-
lescents aged 12 to 17 years.
(2) Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interven-
tions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in
schoolchildren from the age of 6 to 11 years.
(3) Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interven-
tions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in
preschool children up to the age of 6 years.

Given the rapid growth in the treatment of child and adolescent obesity, the original review has now been split into six separate reviews,
with a specific intervention and age focus. Whilst the other reviews in this series utilised an updated version of the original search
strategy, we developed a new search strategy (see Appendix 1) to reflect advances in pharmacological therapies that may not have been
adequately captured in the original search strategy. We decided to exclude trials which included growth hormone therapies to avoid
including trials which treated conditions such as Cushing’s syndrome. In addition, some subgroup analyses were not possible due to a
limited number of trials.
We included only randomised controlled trials that were specifically designed to treat obesity in children and observed participants
for a minimum of six months. The rationale for introducing this criterion arose from the belief that many interventions appear to be
effective in the short term (up to three months), but not in the long term (Glenny 1997). It seemed to be more important to evaluate
the longer-term effects of treatments, as this would provide a more valuable indication of effectiveness, given the chronic nature of
obesity.
