Gold nanorods (AuNRs)-assisted plasmonic photothermal therapy
(AuNRs-PPTT) is a promising strategy for combating cancer in which
AuNRs absorb near-infrared light and convert it into heat, causing cell
death mainly by apoptosis and/or necrosis. Developing a valid PPTT
that induces cancer cell apoptosis and avoids necrosis in vivo and
exploring its molecular mechanism of action is of great importance.
Furthermore, assessment of the long-term fate of the AuNRs after
treatment is critical for clinical use. We first optimized the size, surface
modification [rifampicin (RF) conjugation], and concentration (2.5 nM)
of AuNRs and the PPTT laser power (2 W/cm2) to achieve maximal
induction of apoptosis. Second, we studied the potential mechanism
of action of AuNRs-PPTT using quantitative proteomic analysis in
mouse tumor tissues. Several death pathways were identified, mainly
involving apoptosis and cell death by releasing neutrophil extracellu-
lar traps (NETs) (NETosis), which were more obvious upon PPTT using
RF-conjugated AuNRs (AuNRs@RF) than with polyethylene glycol
thiol-conjugated AuNRs. Cytochrome c and p53-related apoptosis
mechanisms were identified as contributing to the enhanced effect
of PPTT with AuNRs@RF. Furthermore, Pin1 and IL18-related signaling
contributed to the observed perturbation of the NETosis pathway by
PPTT with AuNRs@RF. Third, we report a 15-month toxicity study that
showed no long-term toxicity of AuNRs in vivo. Together, these data
demonstrate that our AuNRs-PPTT platform is effective and safe for
cancer therapy in mouse models. These findings provide a strong
framework for the translation of PPTT to the clinic.

P
lasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) has recently drawn
considerable attention for cancer treatment, because plasmonic
nanoparticles can effectively convert absorbed near-infrared (NIR)
light into heat that ultimately kills cancer cells (1–4). Gold nanorods
(AuNRs) show unique physicochemical properties compared with
other gold nanoparticles (5, 6), in that they absorb and scatter NIR
radiation (650−900 nm) strongly and have suitable aspect ratios
(length divided by width). AuNRs have been found to be one of the
most effective photothermal contrast agents (7, 8). PPTT can in-
duce cell death mainly via two pathways: necrosis and apoptosis (9).
During necrosis, the heat induced by PPTT (if above 50 °C) could
disrupt the plasma membrane, causing the cellular components to
leak out and cause inflammation, metastasis (10), and harm to
surrounding normal tissues. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death
pathway that triggers cancer cell death (11, 12), attenuates in-
flammatory activities, and is regarded as a “cleaner” process of cell
elimination. Skewing the response toward apoptotic cell death
rather than necrotic death will minimize inflammatory responses
that may promote the damage or destruction of healthy tissues.
Therefore, modulating PPTT to trigger apoptosis would be more
favorable in clinical settings (7, 13) It has been reported that dif-
ferent intracellular locations or shapes of nanoparticles potentially
regulate the switch between necrosis and apoptosis (14). In this
study, we aimed to optimize the conditions of AuNRs-PPTT to
trigger apoptosis rather than necrosis and examined the molecular
impact of AuNRs-PPTT in vivo using Western-blot analysis and
MS-based proteomics.
To optimize the efficacy of apoptosis induction, we considered
several aspects of the fabrication of AuNRs (i.e., the size, dose, and
surface modifications of AuNRs) to enhance the internalization
of AuNRs and the generation of heat. Effective internalization
of AuNRs in tumor tissue is a significant challenge (15–18). To
increase the uptake of AuNRs, surface modification with ligands
that assist endocytosis or block exocytosis has been used, aiming at
greater nanoparticle retention inside cancer cells (19). We have
previously developed rifampicin (RF)-conjugated AuNRs for the
purpose of enhancing the internalization of AuNRs in tumor cells.
RF was shown to enhance the entry of AuNRs into cells and de-
crease exocytosis from the cells (20). However, detailed mecha-
nisms of the behavior of RF-coated AuNRs in vivo have yet to be
explored. Heat generation and dose of the AuNRs must also be
considered (21).
To better understand the cellular responses to PPTT, more
systematic studies in vivo are required. Most previous reports
concerning the mechanism of PPTT were only conducted in vitro
(14) and focus on a single protein or pathway. Several mechanisms
Significance
This is a systematic in vivo study of gold nanorods (AuNRs)-
assisted plasmonic photothermal therapy (AuNRs-PPTT) for can-
cer. We have optimized the properties of our AuNRs and the
conditions of PPTT to achieve maximal induction of tumor apo-
ptosis. To examine the molecular mechanisms of action of AuNRs-
PPTT, we used quantitative proteomics to study protein expres-
sion levels in mouse tumor tissues and found the apoptosis
pathway to be significantly perturbed. We report a long-term
toxicity study (up to 15 months in the mouse model) that showed
no toxicity of the AuNRs. Together, these data suggest that our
AuNRs-PPTT has potential as an approach to cancer therapy.

 have been proposed in vitro. Ali et al. (13) proposed heat shock
protein 70 as a major player. Pérez-Hernández et al. (14) reported
that apoptosis during PTT using gold nanoprisms is mediated by
the proteins Bak and Bax, through the activation of the protein
Bid. To better understand the mechanisms involved, systematic
analysis such as MS-based proteomics is necessary.
The safety profile of AuNRs remains largely undefined (22).
Gold is a chemically inert material. Therefore, it is generally con-
sidered biocompatible and has been used in some routine clinical
practices for many years (e.g., in treating rheumatoid arthritis).
Several studies have reported no significant short-term toxicity of
AuNPs (1 day to 3 months) (23–25). You et al. (26) have reported
a lack of both acute and chronic toxicity over 3 months following
multiple injections of PEGylated hollow gold nanospheres in mice.
However, other studies have contradictorily reported that the
presence of nanoparticles causes cytotoxicity such as actin stress
(27), induces apoptosis, or causes inflammation in mouse livers
(28). Some studies have explored how gold nanoparticle exposure
(aside from any heat-induced effects) affects cells at the molecular
level, affects pathways such as mitochondrial oxidative phosphor-
ylation, and causes oxidative stress (29). The dose-dependent ef-
fects of gold nanoparticles on biological systems have been widely
recognized (30). A high dose of NPs or the desorbed surfactants
from their surface could result in “toxic” behavior (31, 32). Of
concern for AuNRs is the incomplete purification of surfactant
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which may cause cy-
totoxicity (33). Therefore, the optimal dose and purification of
AuNRs is of great importance in minimizing toxic effects. The
preservation of spherical AuNPs without complete clearance over
6 months has been reported (34). You et al. (26) also reported slow
clearance of gold nanoparticles from the body during the 3-month
period. Such body deposition of metallic NPs over a long time
period raises significant concerns regarding their long-term safety.
Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the organ uptake,
biodistribution, longer-term fate, and toxicity of AuNRs is essential
to fundamentally understand their in vivo biological interactions
and to use this knowledge to minimize their toxicity (24).
Here, we report the long-term in vivo fate of AuNRs 15 months
after the initial administration, their biodistribution and associated
toxicity in a BALB/c mouse model, and their efficacy in a head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) xenograft model.
Our findings add to the current knowledge of AuNRs-PPTT in
vivo in regulating apoptosis signaling and in providing an effective
and safe potential new treatment. This study provides a strong
framework for the translation of this approach to the clinic.
Results
Efficacy of AuNR@RF/PPTT in Cellular Growth Inhibition in Vitro
(HNSCC Cells) and in Tumor Growth Reduction in an MDA686TU
Xenograft Model. AuNRs were synthesized using a seedless growth
technique (35). AuNRs were conjugated with BSA as a protein carrier
and linker to RF, as shown in schematic Fig. 1A. Detailed descrip-
tions of AuNRs synthesis, conjugation, cellular uptake, and cytotox-
icity measurements are in Supporting Information. Briefly, transmission
electron microscope (TEM) images (Fig. S1A) show the average
size of AuNRs [for small AuNRs: 25 (± 3) nm × 5.5 (± 0.8) nm
(length × width), and for big AuNRs: 72 (± 7) nm × 16 (± 4) nm]
and the UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectrum shows an absorbance centered
near 800 nm, corresponding to the longitudinal surface plasmon
resonance band of AuNRs (Fig. S1B). Successful conjugation of
BSA/RF molecules to the surface of AuNRs (AuNRs@BSA@RF)
was proven by red shift of the plasmon peak of AuNRs in the UV-
Vis spectrum (Fig. S1B), fluorimetry (Fig. S1C), and zeta potential
(Fig. S1D). Successful uptake of AuNRs@RF was observed by 3D
scanning differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (Fig.
1B and Fig. S2), dark-field images (Fig. S1E), and UV-Vis ab-
sorbance (Fig. S1F). After applying PPTT to AuNRs@RF, the
release of RF molecules from the surface of AuNRs, as shown in
schematic Fig. 1A, was demonstrated by UV-Vis spectra (Fig.
S1B). After PPTT, the RF peaks of the particles (330 nm and
470 nm) disappeared, accompanied by increased concentration of
RF in the supernatant, indicating the release of surface RF. The
number of RF molecules per AuNRs was calculated according
to a previous study (36). From the calculation, we found 657
RF molecules present on each AuNRs@BSA, most of which
was released after PPTT as shown in Fig. S1B by the loss of RF
peaks on AuNRs. Furthermore, DIC images (Fig. 1B) show in-
creases in the sizes of nanoparticle aggregates after PPTT, fur-
ther supporting the release of surface ligands after PPTT (shown
in Fig. 1A) which causes the particles to more easily aggregate.
Similarly, AuNRs@PEG were also prepared, and their detailed
characterization is described in Supporting Information (Fig. S3).
The effectiveness of PPTT in the regulation of cell viability was
examined in five HNSCC cell lines, MDA686TU, Fadu, UD-
SCC2, UM-SCC-47, and SqCC/Y1. We applied different concen-
trations of AuNRs@PEG with 2 W/cm2 laser to optimize the
AuNRs concentration. We found inhibition of cell viability (∼30–
50%) following treatment with at least 2.5 nM AuNRs@PEG
compared with nontreated cell lines after 72 h (Fig. S4A). Fur-
thermore, we compared the effectiveness of AuNRs@RF and
AuNRs@PEG in MDA686TU cells. Interestingly, we observed
that AuNRs@RF/PPTT reduced cell viability more efficiently than
AuNRs@PEG/PPTT (Fig. S4B). We also observed that treatment
with both AuNRs@RF and AuNRs@PEG mainly induced apo-
ptosis without obvious necrotic death (Fig. S4C). These observa-
tions prompted us to further investigate the mechanistic details
of AuNRs@RF action. In MDA686TU cells treated with
AuNRs@PEG or AuNRs@RF followed by laser treatment, RF-
conjugated AuNRs induced approximately twice as much apoptosis
compared with AuNRs@PEG/PPTT alone (Fig. 1C and Fig. S4B).
Western-blot analysis revealed that AuNRs-PPTT induced apoptotic
signaling molecules such as cleaved caspase 3 (effector caspase),
followed by cleavage of substrate poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)
(Fig. 1D). In addition, we observed that AuNRs@RF/PPTT re-
duced cell viability and proliferation, evidenced by reduction of
Akt and Erk activation and up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor
protein p21 (Fig. 1D).
To optimize AuNRs concentration and laser power and as-
sess anticancer therapeutic potential in vivo, we established an
MDA686TU xenograft model. We applied three concentrations of
AuNRs (conjugated with PEG or RF), 2.5, 5, and 10 nM, along
with three different powers of laser, 0.5, 1, and 2 W/cm2. In addi-
tion, we compared two different sizes of AuNRs@PEG (the
characterization of big AuNRs is shown in Fig. S5) due to their
different heat conversion capacities. Nanoparticles (100 μL) were
injected intratumorally and laser treatment was performed once on
day 1. We included three control groups: PBS, AuNRs (without
laser), and laser alone. Tumor progression data over 25 days in
mice from each treatment group are presented in Fig. 1E and Figs.
S6 and S7, with the corresponding mice shown in Fig. 1F. We
observed promising tumor growth inhibition with smaller-sized
AuNRs@PEG. Over 25 days, tumor growth was reduced signifi-
cantly in mice treated with AuNRs@PEG at all three concentra-
tions only when the laser power was 2 W/cm2 (Fig. 1E). We
observed that treatment with 10 nM and 5 nM AuNRs@PEG with
2 W/cm2 laser reduced tumor growth by manyfold compared with
the control groups (PBS, laser only, and AuNRs only) (Fig. 1E)
[control groups (PBS, laser, or AuNRs) vs. treated groups (2.5, 5, or
10 nM AuNRs@PEG-PPTT), P < 0.01]. However, we observed skin
wounding effects in mice at these concentrations (Fig. 1F). Treat-
ment with 2.5 nM AuNRs@PEG-PPTT had a moderate wounding
effect; however, tumor growth increased after 20 days (Fig. 1E). In
comparison with 2.5 nM small AuNRs@PEG (25-nm length),
treatment with 2.5 nM large (72-nm length) AuNRs@PEG-PPTT
had no obvious effect on tumor inhibition (Fig. 1E). Because
AuNRs@RF-PPTT showed the most efficient apoptosis in vitro

 (Fig. 1C), we were interested to see the effect in vivo in comparison
with AuNRs@PEG-PPTT. We found that 2.5 nM AuNRs@RF-
PPTT efficiently reduced tumor growth to the same extent as
10 nM AuNRs@PEG-PPTT without any skin wounding (Fig. 1 E
and F) [control groups (PBS, laser, or AuNRs) vs. treated group
(2.5 nM AuNRs@RF-PPTT), P < 0.01]. All mice were killed on day
25 and tumors were collected. Tumor weight was significantly re-
duced in mice treated with all concentrations of small AuNRs with
2 W/cm2 laser (Fig. S6) [control (PBS, laser, or AuNRs) vs. treated
groups, P < 0.01], whereas large AuNRs (Fig. S6) or lower laser
power was unable to reduce tumor growth (Fig. S7). The mice were
monitored during and after tumor cell and nanoparticle injections.
Movement, diet, and vital signs (ruffled fur, weight loss, and normal
activity) were observed throughout the experiments. We did not
observe any abnormalities other than the skin wounding effect at
higher concentrations of AuNRs. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of
mouse tumor tissues for the cell proliferation marker Ki67 (Fig. 1G)
suggested that AuNRs@RF (25-nm length) with 2 W/cm2 laser
significantly reduced cell viability, accompanied by the suppression
of tumor growth progression without any skin wounding effect.
AuNRs@RF-PPTT Induces Stronger Perturbation of Apoptosis and Cell
Death by Releasing Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETosis) Pathway.
We conducted quantitative proteomics experiments using tandem
mass tags (TMT) to study alterations in protein expression levels in
tumor tissues, identify the mechanisms responsible for the induction
of apoptosis by AuNRs@PEG-PPTT and AuNRs@RF-PPTT, and
explore why AuNRs@RF-PPTT was much more effective. Two
biological replicates were conducted for AuNRs@PEG-PPTT-
treated, AuNRs@RF-PPTT-treated, and control groups. Dif-
ferentially expressed proteins identified in each experiment
(AuNRs@PEG-PPTT and AuNRs@RF-PPTT) were compared
(Fig. 2A). In total, we measured 5,222 proteins. For proteomics
analysis, we set ±0.5 as a threshold for fold change (log 2) de-
tection (Fig. 2B). Following AuNRs@PEG-PPTT treatment, 532
proteins were decreased and 600 proteins were increased.
AuNRs@RF-PPTT treatment led to down-regulation of 558 and
up-regulation of 644 proteins (Fig. 2C). Overlap in altered pro-
teins (increased or decreased) is shown in Fig. 2D.
Pathway analysis identified apoptosis-related pathways that were
significantly regulated by AuNRs@RF-PPTT and AuNRs-PPTT
compared with the control group (Fig. 2F), including Granzyme B
signaling, phosphorylation of protein BAD (BCL2 associated ago-
nist of cell death), caspase cascade, and others. These pathways and
associated increased proteins (Fig. 2E and Dataset S1) may provide
a mechanistic explanation for the apoptosis-promoting effect of
PPTT with AuNRs. Apoptosis-related proteins are listed in Fig. 2E
and a schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 2G. A greater increase
in cytochrome c and Apaf-1 protein expression was identified fol-
lowing AuNRs@RF-PPTT vs. AuNRs@RF treatment. Cytochrome
c and Apaf-1 form a complex leading to the activation of caspase-9,

 which activates caspase-3, inducing caspase-3–mediated apoptosis
(37, 38). In addition, we observed the activation of upstream sig-
naling of p38alpha, which leads to ROS generation (39, 40) that can
result in mitochondrial dysfunction-triggered apoptosis. We also
observed increased levels of FANCD2 (Fanconi anemia comple-
mentation group D2), tumor suppressor protein p53, and PTEN
(phosphatase and tensin homolog). FANCD2 is required for the
maintenance of chromosomal stability, which is involved in the
repair of DNA double-strand breaks (41, 42). DNA damage can
affect FANCD2 via FANCL (Fanconi anemia complementation
group L) (43, 44), whereas FANCD2 can further interact with tu-
mor suppressor protein BRCA1 (45, 46). BRCA1 then activates
CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1) (47), which activates p53 (48). Acti-
vated p53 then promotes apoptosis (49). PTEN can also induce
apoptosis via PI3K/AKT-dependent and -independent pathways
(50) or other pathways (51, 52). We observed stronger apoptosis
promotion (i.e., greater up-regulation of apoptosis-related proteins)
with AuNRs@RF-PPTT compared with AuNRs@PEG-PPTT

 treatment (Fig. 2E). These observations at the molecular level
are in agreement with the phenotypic study showing that
AuNRs@RF-PPTT is more effective than AuNRs@PEG-
PPTT in vivo and in vitro.
Interestingly, our proteomics analysis also revealed that treat-
ment with AuNRs@RF-PPTT induced changes in the levels of
several proteins involved in the NETosis pathway more strongly
than AuNRs@PEG-PPTT (Fig. 2F). NETosis refers to a specific
form of neutrophil cell death caused by pathogen infection,
which releases NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps). It has
been recently reported that small NPs activate the NETosis
pathway (53). NETosis can be triggered by two pathways: di-
rectly by IL-18 (54–56) or by chromatin decondensation (57–60).
In this study, proteomics analysis identified nine proteins in the
NETosis pathway. Specifically, a clear elevation of histone H2,
histone H4, IL-18, and Pin1 (peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase,
NIMA-interacting 1) were observed following AuNRs@RF-PPTT
treatment; therefore, both pathways leading to NETosis were
altered (Fig. 2G). Because NETosis is related to endocytosis, we
speculate that AuNRs@RF may be better taken up by cells,
resulting in enhanced NETosis. In summary, from proteomics
analysis we determined that AuNRs@RF-PPTT can induce ap-
optosis and NETosis more efficiently than AuNRs@PEG-PPTT.

 of NIR light (Fig. 1E), indicating their strong clinical potential.
However, there is limited knowledge regarding several features of
this new generation of AuNRs, including their biodistribution,
long-term fate, and toxicity. To assess toxicity, the histopathology
of tissues from the liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of mice was
evaluated by a pathologist 1 month and 15 months after single i.v.
injection of AuNRs@PEG. We did not observe any histopatho-
logical abnormalities in any of the mouse organs (Fig. 3A). Fur-
thermore, we monitored mice every week for 15 months following
AuNRs@PEG injection and did not observe any clinical signs of
toxicity, including ruffled fur, impeded movement, signs of abnormal
constitution, aberrant behavior, loss of weight, ocular or nasal dis-
charge, respiratory distress, inability to walk, or diarrhea. TEM was
used to visually observe AuNRs@PEG particle uptake and organ
tissue microstructure. As seen in Fig. 3B, AuNRs@PEG remained
inside the cells without any structural changes. Measurement of Au
levels in the tissues demonstrated that AuNRs@PEG were present
mostly in the spleen and liver of mice (Fig. 3 C and D), and to a
lesser extent in the kidney and lung (Fig. 3 E and F). To measure
any gold excretion, we tested the amount of Au in the feces of mice
at three different time points (1, 14, and 30 days) (Fig. S8). We
found that a very small portion of injected Au was excreted, whereas
the major portion of Au accumulated mainly in the spleen and liver
and was sustained without any structural modification over a long
period (observed up to 15 months). Au accumulated in mouse
organs from the first day of treatment and remained in these tissues
even 15 months later, without any evidence of toxicities.
Discussion
AuNRs-PPTT is widely recognized as a promising strategy for
combating cancer. Developing a valid PPTT in vivo that triggers
cancer cell apoptosis (avoiding necrosis) and exploring its molecular
mechanism of action is of great importance. In addition, exploring
the long-term fate of the AuNRs after treatment is critical for clinical
use. In this systematic in vivo study, we (i) optimized the conditions
of AuNRs-PPTT to induce apoptosis, (ii) explored the molecular
mechanisms of action of AuNRs-PPTT, and (iii) revealed the long-
term (15 months) fate of AuNRs, which indicated their lack of toxicity
in mouse models. To optimize PPTT conditions to maximize tumor
apoptosis, we evaluated the size, surface modification, and concen-
tration of AuNRs and the PPTT laser power both in vitro (five
HNSCC cell lines) and in vivo (MDA686TU xenograft mice model).
Cell and tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis were clearly observed
in vitro and in vivo. It is worth noting that among the five HNSCC cell
lines we have used UM-SCC-47, which is a human papillomavirus-
positive cell line. Our findings suggest that AuNRs-PPTT is equally
effective against viral- and nonviral-derived tumors. Histopathological
analysis of mice tissue revealed that a lower concentration (2.5 nM) of
AuNRs@RF-PPTT significantly reduced cancer cell viability as
shown by decreased Ki-67. Past attempts to induce apoptosis in vitro
have applied a moderate hyperthermia (61) or targeted different
cellular locations (7, 62, 63). Herein, by adjusting the surface modi-
fication and heat generation, we were able to generate efficient tumor
apoptosis in vivo without any skin wounding.
In our study we have optimized our treatment dose based on the
tumor volume using very low doses (in nanomolar with 100 μL AuNPs
injection volume) and intratumoral injection, which is more realistic
for the clinical application of PPTT. In contrast, most earlier studies
injected the nanoparticles intravenously, at doses based on animal
body weight (nanoparticle amount in milligrams per kilogram body
weight) (8, 64, 65) Compared with other studies, we used a moderate
laser intensity and low exposure time (0.5–2 W/cm2 for 2 min) (66).
The effect of heat shock (hyperthermia) on the induction of cell
apoptosis has been known for centuries. The mechanism of
hyperthermia-induced apoptosis has been largely unclear until re-
cently (67). PPTT is not simply heat shock; instead, it could be
regarded as a synergistic effect between nanoparticles and hyper-
thermia. We observed that both apoptosis and NETosis pathways
were significantly affected after treatment with PPTT, especially
AuNRs@RF-PPTT, which demonstrated a much stronger molec-
ular impact on these pathways. Cytochrome c and p53-related
apoptosis mechanisms were identified as contributing to the en-
hanced effect of PPTT with RF-conjugated AuNRs. Furthermore,
Pin1 and IL18-related signaling contribute to the observed per-
turbation of the NETosis pathway by PPTT with RF-conjugated
AuNRs. Up-regulation of Pin1 has been shown to induce ROS
production through phosphorylation of NADPH oxidase regula-
tory subunits p47-phox and p67-phox (57–59). ROS production
further leads to the release of PERM. Histone H4 and histone H2 are
subsequently degraded, leading to chromatin decondensation, which
is further enhanced by PERM. Eventually the integrity of the nuclear
envelope is disrupted, resulting in cell rupturing (60). The greater
effect of AuNRs@RF-PPTT on NETosis may result from better
uptake of AuNRs into the cells when conjugated with RF. It has been
reported recently that cells entrap nanoparticles via formation of
NETs, which are formed immediately following rapid damage to
plasma membranes and instability of the lysosomal compartment
induced by nanoparticle stimulation (53). The significant effects ob-
served in our study of AuNRs@RF-PPTT on the NETosis pathway
may account for the greater efficacy of the RF conjugate.
After PPTT, we observed the aggregation of AuNRs@RF
around cell nuclear membranes as shown by DIC microscopy (Fig.
1B). Our proteomics study identified greater up-regulation of nuclear
lamin proteins (Fig. 2E), which are responsible for nuclear shape and
structure. Therefore, AuNRs@RF may harm nuclear membrane
integrity through intrinsic cell defense mechanisms. However, lamins
are known to impede cancer cell migration and invasion (68, 69)
Lamin promotes cell-matrix adhesion and plays an important role in
apoptosis by loosening epithelial cell contact with the extracellular
matrix (70). Lamins are targets for degradation in the apoptotic
process and accordingly are often used as markers for apoptosis (71).
There is to date limited knowledge regarding the biodistribution,
long-term fate, and toxicity of AuNRs. Thus, our studies of the
toxicity of AuNRs are important to develop safer treatments. This
is a long-term toxicity study of AuNRs in mice lasting for 15 months.
Based on our findings, we can conclude that these AuNRs have great
potential to be used in PPTT for the local treatment of cancers,
supporting the efficient translation of AuNRs into clinical settings.
In summary, we have optimized the efficacy and studied the
molecular mechanisms of AuNRs-assisted PPTT and examined the
15-month toxicity and fate of AuNRs in a mouse model. Together,
these data demonstrate that our AuNRs-PPTT is highly effective
and safe for local therapy for cancers. These findings provide a
strong framework for translation of this approach to the clinic.
Methods
AuNRs Synthesis, Conjugation, and Characterization. A seedless growth method
was used for the synthesis of AuNRs with an average size of 25 ± 3 nm × 5.5 ±
0.8 nm (length × width) (35). Briefly, HAuCl4 (5.0 mL, 1.0 mM) was added to
5.0 mL of 0.2 M CTAB at room temperature. Then, 250 μL of 4.0 mM AgNO3,
8 μL of 12 M HCl, and 70 μL of ascorbic acid (78.8 mM) was successively added
and the solution was gently mixed. Immediately afterward, 15 μL of 0.01 M ice-
cold NaBH4 was injected into the unstirred growth solution and allowed to
react for 12 h. The synthesized AuNRs were then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for
50 min and redispersed in deionized (DI) water, followed by a second centri-
fugation at 19,000 × g for 40 min to remove the extra CTAB. A seed-mediated
growth method was used for the synthesis of AuNRs with an average size of
72 ± 7 nm × 16 ± 4 nm, where 4.0 mM of silver nitrate and 78.8 mM of ascorbic
acid were added to a growth solution consisting of 0.2 M CTAB, 1.0 mM of
HAuCl4, and 0.01 M of NaBH4. Then, CTAB stabilized AuNRs were purified by
centrifugation (10,000 × g for 50 min) and redispersed in DI H2O, followed by a
second centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 30 min. For AuNRs conjugated with PEG,
we added mPEG-SH (1 mM) to the nanoparticles overnight to achieve about
20,000 ligands on each particle. For AuNRs conjugated with RF, we first added
50 mL of 0.5 mM BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) to 1 nM AuNRs solution, which was then
incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Then, 300 μL of 5 mM RF was added to
the AuNRs solution and incubated for 3 h. After conjugation, the particles were
centrifuged to remove the extra ligands. TEM was used to examine particle size

 and homogeneity. UV-Vis spectrometer and ZetaSizer 3000 (Malvern Instru-
ments) were used to examine whether the conjugation was successful. For BSA
fluorescent quenching experiments, excitation and emission measurements
were carried out on a Quanta Master 300 phosphorescence/fluorescence spec-
trofluorometer. BSA was used at a concentration of 10−4 M. The number of RF
molecules per AuNRs was calculated according to Ali et al. (36), based on the
UV-Vis spectra. The dose of AuNRs was presented as molar concentration. For
comparison with other studies, 5 nM = 1 OD (35).
Dark-Field Images. MDA686TU cells were seeded on glass coverslips in complete
growth medium for 24 h to achieve 40% final confluence. Cells were incubated
with 2.5 nM AuNRs with RF or PEG conjugation in supplemented DMEM cell
culture medium for 24 h. Dark-field images were taken using an inverted mi-
croscope equipped with a dark-field condenser and Lumenera Infinity2 CCD
camera; a 20× objective lens was used to collect scattered light from the samples
to produce dark-field images.
DIC Microscopy. MDA686TU cells were seeded on glass coverslips in complete
growth medium for 24 h then incubated with 2.5 nM AuNRs with RF or PEG
conjugation in supplemented DMEM cell culture medium for 24 h. For DIC
imaging, an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope equipped with Perfect Focus
System (PFS, 25-nm z-axial resolution) was used for imaging and z-stacks ac-
quisitions under DIC microscopy. The DIC mode used a DIC polarizer and analyzer
pair, a high-resolution 100× I-R DIC slider, a high numerical aperture (N.A. 1.40)
oil-immersion condenser lens, a Nikon CFI Apo TIRF 100× (N.A. 1.49) oil-
immersion objective, and a 12 V/100 W halogen lamp as light source. Appro-
priate bandpass filters were placed in the light path. Z-stack movies were taken
by a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 V2 CMOS camera (C11440-22CU, pixel size
6.5 μm × 6.5 μm) with Camera Link interface using Micro-Manager and analyzed
using NIH ImageJ and reconstructed in Amira. Fixed Hey cells on 22- × 22-mm
glass coverslips were rinsed with Dulbecco’s PBS at pH 7.4 and fabricated into a
sandwiched chamber with two pieces of double-sided tape and a cleaned glass
slide. PBS solution was added into the chamber to fill the space and the
chamber was sealed with clear nail polish. The sample slide was then placed
under the microscope for observation. Z-stacks were acquired using the multi-
dimensional acquisition function in Micro-Manager. DIC optical sectioning
(Movies S1 and S2) through the whole cell thickness was achieved by moving
the objective on the motorized nosepiece using PFS at 65 nm per step at 33-ms
(30 frames per s) exposure time.
Cell Lines. Information and primary sources of HNSCC cell lines MDA686TU,
Fadu, and SqCC/Y1 were described elsewhere (72). UD-SCC2 and UM-SCC-47 cell
lines were obtained from R. L. Ferris, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Center,
Pittsburgh. Cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator.
Cell Viability Assay. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay was used for cell viability
determination (73). Cells were seeded (5 × 103 cells per well) in a 96-well plate.
Twenty-four hours later cells were treated with AuNRs for 24 h and exposed to
laser for 2 min. Cells were fixed after another 24 h. Plates were stained with
SRB and bound SRB was dissolved to assess OD at 492 nm using a microplate
reader. The percentage of surviving cells was calculated based on the absor-
bance values relative to the nontreated samples.
Apoptosis Assay. Apoptotic cells were identified and measured as described
elsewhere (74). Briefly, cells were collected and stained with Annexin
V-phycoerythrene and 7-AAD (BD Pharmingen) for 15 min at room tempera-
ture. Samples were measured using a FACS caliber bench-top flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson). FlowJo software (Tree Star) was used for apoptosis analysis.
Western-Blot Analysis. Western blot was incubated with primary followed by
secondary antibodies and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence
system as described (74). Primary antibodies were anti–phospho-Akt, anti-
total Akt, anti–phospho-Erk, anti-total Erk, anti-caspase3, anti-caspase3, and
anti-PARP from Cell Signaling; anti-p21 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and
anti–β-actin from Sigma-Aldrich. Secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Western band quantification was performed using Image-
Quant TL software (GE/Amersham Biosciences).
Nude Mice Bearing Human HNSCC Xenograft Tumor Model. Based on protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory
University, female nude mice (athymic nu/nu) aged 4–6 wk were purchased
from Taconic. Each mouse was injected with 5 × 106 MDA686TU cells s.c. in the
right flank, and tumor volume was monitored (volume = 0.5 × length × width2).
Mice were randomized into groups once the tumors reached 70 mm3. Mice
were injected intratumorally with PBS or different concentrations of AuNRs and
exposed to different powers of NIR laser for 2 min (five mice per group). Tu-
mors were monitored every other day and mice were killed on the 25th day
after cancer cell transplantation. Tumors and organs were collected, measured,
and processed for paraffin embedding.
IHC. Upon deparaffinization and rehydration, tissue sections were per-
meabilized with 0.25% Triton-X-100/PBS for 5 min. Tissue sections were blocked
with 2.5% horse serum for 30 min. To detect intracellular localization and
expression levels of Ki-67 proteins, we used mouse anti-human Ki-67 antibody
(prediluted; Invitrogen) then counterstained cell nuclei using DAPI (Invitrogen).
Mouse and rabbit IgG were used as negative controls.
Sample Preparation for Proteomics. MDA686TU cells (5 × 106) were injected
into the right flank of nude mice. We injected a single dose of AuNRs@PEG
(2.5 nM) or AuNRs@RF (2.5 nM) intratumorally followed by 2 min of 2 W/cm2
NIR laser exposure when the tumors had reached 150 mm3. Twenty-four hours
later we collected tumors for proteomics analysis. Each experiment was re-
peated twice. Mouse tumor tissues were homogenized, followed by ultrasonic
tissue ablation with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl
0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate 1% Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40, and
phosphatase inhibitors). The cells were then scraped down and the obtained
mixtures homogenized with sonication and vortexing. Cell debris was re-
moved by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Four volumes of ice-
cold acetone/ethanol/acetic acid (vol/vol/vol = 50/50/0.1) was added to the
supernatant to precipitate the proteins at −20 °C overnight. After centrifu-
gation, the protein pellet was redissolved in denaturing buffer (pH 8.0) con-
taining 8 M urea and 50 mM Hepes, and the protein concentration was tested
using a Bradford assay. The disulfide bonds in the protein solution were re-
duced by 2 mM DTT at 37 °C for 2 h and subsequently alkylated by adding
6 mM iodoacetamide and incubation in darkness at room temperature for
40 min (75). Purified peptides were labeled with 6-plex TMT reagents (Thermo)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, lyophilized peptides were dis-
solved in 100 μL of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5.
Each channel of the TMT reagents was dissolved in 41 μL of anhydrous ACN
and transferred into the peptide tube. The reaction was performed at room
temperature for 1 h then was quenched by adding 8 μL of 5% hydroxylamine.
Peptides from all six tubes were then mixed, desalted again using a tC18 Sep-
Pak cartridge, and lyophilized overnight. For protein analysis, the peptide
mixture was separated by high pH reversed-phase HPLC into 20 fractions
with a 40-min gradient of 5–55% acetonitrile (ACN) in 10 mM ammonium
acetate (pH 10).
Liquid Chromatography–Tandem MS Analysis and Database Search. After TMT
labeling and purification, lyophilized peptide samples were dissolved in 10 μL
solvent of 5% (vol/vol) ACN and 4% (vol/vol) formic acid (FA), and 4 μL of the
dissolved sample were loaded onto a microcapillary column packed with
C18 beads (Magic C18AQ, 3 μm 200 Å, 100 μL × 16 cm; Michrom Bioresources)
by a Dionex WPS-3000TPLRS autosampler (UltiMate 3000 thermostated Rapid
Separation Pulled Loop Wellplate Sampler). Peptides were separated by
reversed-phase chromatography using an UltiMate 3000 binary pump with a
90-min gradient of 4–30% (vol/vol) ACN (in 0.125% FA). Peptides were de-
tected with a data-dependent Top15 method (76) in a hybrid dual-cell quad-
rupole linear ion trap–Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap Elite;
ThermoFisher, with Xcalibur 3.0.63 software). For each cycle, one full MS
scan (resolution 60,000) in the Orbitrap at 106 AGC target was followed by up
to 15 MS/MS for the most intense ions. The selected ions were excluded from
further analysis for 90 s. Ions with single or unassigned charge were discarded.
MS2 scans were performed in the orbitrap cell by activating with high energy
collision dissociation at 40% normalized collision energy with 1.2 m/z isolation
width. All MS2 spectra were converted into mzXML format and then searched
using the SEQUEST algorithm (version 28) (77). Spectra were matched against a
database containing sequences of all proteins in the UniProt Human (Homo
sapiens) database. The following parameters were used during the search:
20 ppm mass tolerance; fully digested with trypsin; up to three missed cleavages;
fixed modifications: carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.0214), TMT modifi-
cation of lysine (+229.1629) and N terminus (+229.1629); variable modifications:
oxidation of methionine (+15.9949). False discovery rates (FDRs) of peptide and
protein identifications were evaluated and controlled by the target-decoy
method (78). Each protein sequence was listed in both forward and reversed
orders. Linear discriminant analysis, which is similar to other methods in the
literature (79), was used to control the quality of peptide (80). Peptides fewer
than seven amino acid residues in length were discarded. Furthermore, peptide

 spectral matches were filtered to <1% FDR. An additional protein-level filter was
applied in each dataset to reduce the protein-level FDRs (<1%).
Proteomics Data Analysis. For proteomics analysis each experiment was re-
peated twice. The mean expression level of each protein was used for
downstream analysis. Raw data were normalized using supervised normali-
zation of microarray (81). Variance due to biological replicates was adjusted
by setting them as variables in the model. Variance explained by different
experimental treatments (control, AuNRs@PEG-PPTT, and AuNRs@RF-PPTT)
was fitted as a biological variable in the model. Hierarchical clustering was
performed with statistical software R. Proteins identified as being affected
were subjected to pathway analysis using the MetaCore from Thomson
Reuters.
Short-Term and Long-Term Uptake Fate of PEGylated AuNRs. BALB/C mice
(male), 6 wk of age, were injected via the tail vein with a 200-μL solution of Au NRs
(0.18 mg/kg). At specified time points of 1 day, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days and
15 months mice were killed by pressurized CO2 asphyxiation, three mice in each
group. Liver, spleen, kidney, and lung were collected, rinsed with distilled water,
and dried. The dried tissues were dissolved and assayed for Au using ICP-MS.
Histopathology Evaluation. Liver, spleen, kidney, and lung tissues were em-
bedded in paraffin and cut at 5-μm thickness. The tissues were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma) to assess histological alterations via microscopy.
Statistical Analysis. All results represent the average of at least three separate
experiments and are expressed as mean ± SD or SE. Statistical analysis was
conducted using t test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
