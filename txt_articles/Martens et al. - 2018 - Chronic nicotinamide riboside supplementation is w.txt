Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) has emerged as a critical co-substrate for
enzymes involved in the beneficial effects of regular calorie restriction on healthspan. As
such, the use of NAD+ precursors to augment NAD+ bioavailability has been proposed as a
strategy for improving cardiovascular and other physiological functions with aging in humans.
Here we provide the evidence in a 2 × 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
crossover clinical trial that chronic supplementation with the NAD+ precursor vitamin,
nicotinamide riboside (NR), is well tolerated and effectively stimulates NAD+ metabolism in
healthy middle-aged and older adults. Our results also provide initial insight into the effects of
chronic NR supplementation on physiological function in humans, and suggest that, in par-
ticular, future clinical trials should further assess the potential benefits of NR for reducing
blood pressure and arterial stiffness in this group.

 A
dvancing age is the primary risk factor for the develop-
ment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which remains the
leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrial and
post-industrial societies1. The increase in CVD risk with aging is
driven largely by adverse changes to arteries, including stiffening
of the aorta, and by increases in systolic blood pressure2. As such,
interventions designed to lower blood pressure and/or improve
arterial function hold promise for preventing age-related CVD.
Chronic calorie restriction (CR) prevents the development of
arterial dysfunction and increases in blood pressure with aging in
rodents3,4, and lowers arterial stiffness and blood pressure in
overweight-obese
middle-aged
and
older
adults5,6.
Despite
numerous health benefits, adherence to chronic CR remains poor
and possibly even unsafe in normal weight older adults7–9. As
such, there is a critical need to establish safe, practical alternatives
to regular CR for enhancing cardiovascular function and health
with aging in humans10.
The recent identification of several key molecular mechanisms
responsible for CR-mediated longevity in model organisms has
led to an exciting search for “CR-mimetic” interventions to
improve cardiovascular and other physiological functions with
aging11,12. In this regard, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+) has emerged as a critical signaling molecule and
essential substrate for sirtuins, a class of enzymes that mediate
several of the beneficial effects of CR in model organisms13,14,
including the maintenance of cardiovascular function15. More-
over, CR has been shown to increase NAD+ levels in pre-clinical
models16,17. The cellular bioavailability of NAD+ and related
metabolites declines in animals and in humans during normal
aging13,18–21 and may contribute to physiological aging by
reducing sirtuin activity. Although NAD+ can be synthesized de
novo from the amino acid tryptophan, this process does not occur
in all tissues, requiring most cells to rely on a salvage pathway for
regenerating NAD+ from other intracellular intermediates, which
are primarily made available through dietary sources22. Vitamin
B3 (niacin: i.e., nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) enters this sal-
vage pathway and acts as a NAD+ precursor; however, nicotinic
acid is associated with undesirable flushing at therapeutic doses23
and nicotinamide does not reliably activate (and may even inhi-
bit) sirtuins despite raising concentrations of NAD+24–26.
Therefore, administration of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide is
unlikely to be widely adopted for maintaining health and function
with aging.
In contrast to these compounds, oral supplementation with
either of the NAD+ metabolites, nicotinamide mononucleotide
(NMN) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), increases levels of NAD+
and
improves
multiple
physiological
functions
in
animal
models18,27,28. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that supple-
mentation of NMN in the drinking water improved cardiovas-
cular
function
in
old
mice29.
Moreover,
CR
increases
concentrations of NR and NAD+ and restores normal circadian
gene transcription in the liver, further suggesting that NR may act
as a CR mimetic30. Thus, NMN and NR are NAD+ boosting
compounds that hold promise for enhancing cardiovascular
health and physiological function with aging31,32.
Despite these encouraging results from preclinical studies, the
tolerability and effectiveness of chronic supplementation with
NMN or NR have not been established in humans. Because NR is
readily taken up by cells and acts as a direct vitamin precursor for
NAD+ synthesis33, its recent development as a dietary ingredient
(NIAGEN®, ChromaDex Inc., Irvine, CA) has provided the first
opportunity to translate the potential benefits of NAD+ boosting
molecules to people. In this regard, a recent study showed that
single doses of NR stimulated blood cellular NAD+ metabolism
in healthy humans in a dose-dependent manner26. However, the
tolerability of chronic NR supplementation and its efficacy for
increasing NAD+ bioavailability have not been established in
humans, and we lack even initial insight into the potential of NR
for improving cardiovascular and other physiological functions
with human aging.
To address these important research gaps, we conducted a
small randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial of
NR supplementation (500 mg, 2×/day) to assess its overall tol-
erability and efficacy vs. placebo for raising levels of NAD+
-related metabolites in healthy middle-aged and older men and
women. We also took the opportunity to gain preliminary insight
into the effects of chronic NR supplementation for improving
cardiovascular and other physiological functions associated with
risk of clinical diseases and/or disability with aging. Our results
demonstrate that 6 weeks of NR supplementation at this dose is
well-tolerated in humans and effectively increases blood cellular
NAD+ concentrations. Exploratory analyses of the effects of
chronic NR supplementation on physiological function in this
cohort of healthy middle-aged and older adults suggest that the
potential for reducing systolic blood pressure and arterial stiffness
may be the most promising hypotheses to investigate in future
larger-scale clinical trials, particularly in individuals with elevated
baseline blood pressure.
Results
Subject enrollment and baseline characteristics. Information on
subject consent, randomization, testing and completion is pre-
sented in Fig. 1. Sixty healthy middle-aged and older men and
women between the ages of 55 and 79 years were consented for
this study, which was registered on clinicaltrials.gov under the
identifier NCT02921659 and conducted between March 2015 and
September 2016. The individuals recruited for this study were
lean (average BMI = 24 ± 4 kg m−2) and healthy, and were
representative of the late middle-aged/older adult population
within
the

County
Colorado
community.
Twenty-five participants did not meet inclusion criteria and were
excluded without being randomized. Four participants dropped
out of the study prior to randomization due to a conflict with
time commitment, and one individual was unresponsive to

 scheduling requests, resulting in a total of 30 subjects remaining
for randomization. Of these, 15 subjects were randomized to
Group A, which received placebo capsules during the first 6 weeks
of the study before crossing over to receive NR capsules for the
remaining 6 weeks. The other 15 subjects were randomized to
Group B, which received NR capsules first followed by placebo.
One subject was withdrawn from Group A due to a change in
medication status that no longer met inclusion criteria, and two
subjects in Group A elected to drop out of the study due to a
complaint of side effects (see below). Two subjects were with-
drawn from Group B due to a change in health or medication
status that no longer met inclusion criteria, and one subject
elected to drop out of Group B due to a non-study-related injury,
resulting in a total of 24 subjects who completed the trial.
Removal of these six subjects did not influence the overall
makeup of the group because the characteristics for the 24 sub-
jects who completed the trial were similar to those for all
30 subjects who were initially randomized (Supplementary
Table 8). The subjects that completed the study were well mat-
ched between groups for age, sex and clinical characteristics, and
all baseline values were within normal clinical ranges (Table 1).
Treatment-emergent adverse events. Adherence to the study
treatments was excellent, with all subjects consuming greater than
95% of all NR and placebo capsules administered. NR was well
tolerated at the dose tested, and no serious adverse events
occurred. A total of 14 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs)
were reported by 7 of the 30 participants enrolled in the study,
with the other 23 subjects reporting no AEs. All self-reported AEs
were mild in severity. The reported symptoms included nausea,
flushing, leg cramps and increased bruising during the NR con-
dition, and headache, skin rash, flushing, fainting and drowsiness
during the placebo condition (Table 2). Only 2 out of the 30
enrolled subjects (<10%) dropped out of the study due to a
complaint of side effects, both occurring while subjects were in
the placebo phase (headache and skin rash); no subject dropped
out during the NR treatment condition.
Clinical laboratory values were obtained from blood samples
collected at the end of each treatment phase in 21 of the
24 subjects who completed the study. Complete blood work could
not be obtained from the remaining three subjects due to failed
catheterization (n = 1), administrative error (n = 1) or study
nurse error (n = 1). No meaningful differences were observed
between treatment conditions for hematology (Supplementary
Table 1), blood chemistry, including markers of renal function
and liver enzymes (Supplementary Table 2), or blood lipid
profiles
(Supplementary
Table
3).
Importantly,
all
clinical
laboratory values remained within the normal reference range
during both the placebo and NR conditions. Collectively, these
results indicate that oral supplementation with NR for 6 weeks at
this dose is well-tolerated in healthy middle-aged and older
adults.
Efficacy of NR for increasing NAD+ and related metabolites.
After demonstrating the tolerability of chronic NR supple-
mentation, our primary objective was to determine if NR raises
blood cellular NAD+ metabolism in humans. Because blood
NAD+ and several related metabolites of interest have recently
been shown to be measurable in circulating peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but undetectable in plasma and
urine26, we assessed the NAD+ metabolome in circulating
PBMCs, as previously established34.
Oral NR supplementation effectively elevated levels of NAD+
in PBMCs by ~60% compared with placebo (mean change = 6.2
pmol per mg protein; one-sided 95% CI (0.074, ∞)). The mean
level of NADP+ also increased, but did not reach statistical
significance (mean change = 1.2 pmol per mg protein; one-sided
95% CI (−2.15, ∞)) (Fig. 2 and Table 3). Of note, NR also
elevated levels of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD)
nearly fivefold above the placebo condition (mean change = 1.1
pmol per mg protein; 95% CI (0.26, ∞)), confirming a previous
report that NAAD is a highly sensitive and reliable biomarker of
increased NAD+ metabolism and a product of NR utilization in
humans26.

 nicotinamide (NaM), but this was not statistically significant
(mean change = 106.5 pmol per mg protein; one-sided 95% CI
(−10.03, ∞)). An increase in NaM would suggest an increase in
the activity of NAD+-consuming enzymes, which catalyze the
breakdown of NAD+ into NaM and ADP-Ribose35. Though not
significant, we also observed an ~1.5-fold increase in NMN (mean
change = 0.72 pmol per mg protein; one-sided 95% CI (−0.60,
∞)), which may indicate the possible conversion of NR to NMN
by nicotinamide riboside kinase (NRK) enzymes or further
metabolism of NaM into NMN by nicotinamide phosphoribosyl-
transferase (NAMPT)35. Consistent with the only other report of
NR ingestion in humans26, we were unable to detect NR
concentrations in PBMCs during either treatment condition,
despite using optimized recovery methods. The magnitude by
which NAD+ increased in response to NR supplementation was
negatively associated with blood cellular NAD+ concentration
during the placebo condition (R = −0.49, R2 = 0.25), suggesting a
greater response in individuals with naturally low blood cellular
NAD+ levels.
In addition to boosting NAD+-specific metabolites in PBMCs,
we also observed increases in the mean concentration of other
metabolites involved in the regulation of energy production and
metabolism, including adenosine and adenosine triphosphate
(ATP; mean change = 699 pmol per mg protein; one-sided 95%
CI (84, ∞); Fig. 2 and Table 3); however, analysis of this
metabolite was considered a secondary outcome and the increase
did not attain statistical significance after correction for multiple
comparisons. NR supplementation also tended to raise levels of
adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate

statistical significance (Supplementary Table 4). Collectively,
these
findings
indicate
that
chronic
NR
supplementation
effectively stimulates NAD+ metabolism in healthy middle-aged
and older men and women.
Effect of NR on indicators of cardiovascular health. Supple-
mentation with NR tended to lower mean systolic (SBP; mean
change = −3.9 mmHg; one-sided 95% CI (−∞, −0.058)) and
diastolic (DBP; mean change = −2.0 mmHg; one-sided 95% CI
(−∞, −0.26)) blood pressure (BP) in all subjects as a group
(Fig. 3a–c); however, these comparisons were not statistically
significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Because
the risk of cardiovascular events is greatly increased in indivi-
duals with above-normal baseline BP36, we performed a follow-
up analysis to compare the effect of NR on BP in the partici-
pants with BP in the normal range (SBP/DBP < 120/80 mmHg;
N = 11) vs. those with BP in the elevated/stage I hypertension
range (SBP, 120–139 mmHg; DBP, 80–89 mmHg; N = 13)
based on recently updated guidelines37. Of particular note,
mean SBP was 9 mmHg lower after NR vs. placebo in indivi-
duals with elevated/stage I hypertension, whereas no change
was observed in subjects with initial SBP in the normal range
(Fig.
3d).
Because
this
post-hoc
subgroup
analysis
was
exploratory, no statistical inferences can be made. The median
values and ranges for all blood pressure variables are provided
in Supplementary Table 6.
We also observed a trend towards a reduction in the mean
carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) with NR supplemen-
tation, the clinical “gold standard” measure of the stiffness of the
aorta38, and a strong independent risk factor for incident
cardiovascular events with aging and age-related diseases (Fig. 4a;
mean change = −41.5 m s−1; one-sided 95% CI (−∞, −4.8)).
However, this reduction was not statistically significant after
correction for multiple comparisons. Similar to our exploratory
analysis of BP, NR supplementation tended to lower aortic
stiffness (carotid-femoral PWV) more in individuals with higher
baseline BP (Fig. 4b), although no statistical inferences were made
for this post-hoc comparison. No effect of NR was observed on
ultrasound-determined carotid artery compliance (Fig. 4c) or
brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, a measure of vascular
endothelial function (Fig. 4d).
Effect of NR on other domains of physiological function. To
gain exploratory insight into potential benefits of NR supple-
mentation on other domains of physiological function in healthy

 outcomes indicative of metabolic function, motor function, and
exercise capacity/performance. Total energy intake and expendi-
ture, oxidative fuel source (carbohydrate vs. fat), and physical
activity patterns were not affected by NR (Supplementary
Table 7). Likewise, we observed no difference in body mass, body
mass index (BMI) or percent body fat compared with the placebo
arm (Supplementary Table 7) and no differences were observed in
measures of glucose or insulin regulation (Supplementary
Table 7). Finally, there was no effect of the intervention on overall
motor function (Supplementary Figure 2), maximal exercise
capacity, as assessed by VO2 max and treadmill time to exhaus-
tion (Supplementary Figure 1A, B), or on markers of submaximal
exercise performance (Supplementary Figure 1C−F).
Discussion
The primary finding of this study is that chronic oral supple-
mentation with 1000 mg per day of NR is a well-tolerated and
effective strategy for stimulating NAD+ metabolism in healthy
middle-aged and older humans. Additionally, our exploratory
analyses of the effects of NR supplementation on physiological
function suggest that the ability of NR to reduce SBP and aortic
stiffness, two clinically important risk indicators of cardiovascular
function and health, are among the most promising hypotheses to
test in a future larger-scale clinical trial, particularly in individuals
with above-normal baseline SBP.
In this small initial intervention trial, NR was well tolerated
and elicited no serious adverse effects. Additionally, we found
that NR stimulated NAD+ metabolism without any difference in
treatment-emergent AEs compared with placebo, supporting
previous suggestions that NR may be a more suitable NAD+
precursor than niacin (i.e., nicotinic acid and nicotinamide),
which` also is capable of entering the NAD+ salvage pathway, but
is associated with a painful flushing sensation at therapeutic
doses22,23. The flushing response induced by niacin is specifically
caused by the binding of nicotinic acid to the Gpr109A receptor
on epithelial cells39,40, an action that is not expected to occur with
NR, thereby minimizing the risk of this side effect at equivalent
doses22. Although three of the subjects in our study did report
flushing, two of these subjects were taking the placebo capsules,
suggesting that NR itself did not appear to be associated with
flushing. Despite these promising findings, we wish to emphasize
that the size of the cohort in the present study is insufficient to
establish the broader safety profile of NR at this dose. Larger,
more definitive clinical trials, similar to those conducted with
niacin, will be necessary to confirm this preliminary evaluation of
tolerability and to more definitively assess its overall safety.
However, indirect evidence for the potential safety of NR sup-
plementation is suggested by the widespread use of niacin over
past 60 years for the treatment of high cholesterol, with limited
side effects other than flushing41.
Niacin serves as important dietary precursor to NAD+ and
helps sustain cellular function and protect against pellagra, a
condition characterized by dark pigmented skin, dermatitis,
diarrhea, and dementia. Like niacin, NR has been detected in
cow’s milk42,43 and may theoretically act as another vitamin
precursor form of NAD+. However, the amount of NR naturally
consumed through the diet is likely much smaller than the dose
tested in the present study. The primary natural sources of vita-
min B3 come from NAD+, NADPH and NADH, which are more
abundant in food sources and are broken down into salvageable
precursors, including niacin and NR. To protect against pellagra,
the recommended daily allowances of niacin for adult men and
women have been set at 16 and 14 mg per day, respectively22,
whereas higher doses of niacin have beneficial effects on lipid
profiles of individuals at risk for cardiovascular events23. It is
plausible that the daily requirement for NAD+ precursors may
increase with advancing age due to decreasing NAD+ bioavail-
ability, although no such recommendation presently exits.
An important goal of the present study was to identify clini-
cally relevant physiological outcomes for future larger-scale
(phase II) clinical trials of NR supplementation. The most pro-
mising result of these exploratory analyses was a trend towards an
improvement in selective indicators of cardiovascular function.
Compared with placebo, NR tended to lower SBP and aortic
stiffness, two major independent risk factors for incident cardi-
ovascular events and disease with advancing age2,36, in the overall
group. A follow-up analysis suggested that this trend was most
pronounced in individuals with baseline BP between 120 and 139
mmHg, a subgroup currently classified clinically as having either
“elevated” SBP (120–129 mmHg) or stage 1 systolic hypertension
(130–139 mmHg). The mean decrease in SBP after NR treatment
in this subgroup approached 10 mmHg—a magnitude of change
associated with a 25% decrease in incident CV events in a recent
major anti-hypertensive drug trial in older adults44. If this mag-
nitude of SBP reduction with NR supplementation is confirmed
in a larger clinical trial, such an effect could have broad biome-
dical implications. SBP in this range (120−139 mmHg) is
observed in ~50% of all middle-aged and older adults in the U.
S.45 Moreover, SBP < 140 mmHg is responsible for at least one-
third of all BP-attributable deaths46 and is associated with
increased risk of heart disease, stroke, cognitive impairment/
dementia and chronic kidney disease, among other disorders of
aging47. Importantly, for individuals with SBP of 120–139 mmHg,
lifestyle modifications, such as healthy diet and regular exercise
are recommended before prescribing anti-hypertensive medica-
tions37. Given the low adherence to healthy lifestyle practices in
middle-aged and older adults7, a natural, CR-mimicking, dietary
supplement like NR with potential BP-lowering effects might
represent a complementary approach for preserving cardiovas-
cular health with aging.
We also observed a trend towards a reduction in carotid-
femoral PWV after NR supplementation in the present study,
suggesting that this measure of aortic stiffness may represent
another promising cardiovascular outcome of interest for a larger
future clinical trial. As with the effects on SBP, individuals with
higher baseline BP appeared to demonstrate the largest mean
changes in carotid-femoral PWV in response to NR treatment.
Carotid-femoral PWV is not only independently predictive of
incident CVD in older adults, but has recently been linked
to numerous other age-associated diseases and disorders includ-
ing mild cognitive impairment, chronic kidney disease, and
frailty48–51. Thus, healthy lifestyle-mimicking dietary supple-
ments with the potential to reduce age-related stiffening of the
aorta would be of significant clinical interest. It should be noted
that any NR-associated changes in BP may have contributed to
corresponding changes in carotid-femoral PWV (and vice versa),
so the changes in SBP and arterial stiffness are interrelated52–54.
Little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which
NAD+ precursors may reduce BP and aortic stiffness in humans.
NAD+ is an obligate substrate for the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT-
1), which is implicated in the maintenance of healthy vascular
function3,15,55. In this regard, treatment with the proposed
pharmacological SIRT-1 activator SRT1720 protects against the
development of aortic stiffness and hypertension in Klotho-
deficient mice (a model of accelerated aging), by lowering vas-
cular oxidative stress56. Likewise, we have demonstrated that
supplementation with NMN reverses aortic stiffening in old mice
to youthful levels by increasing aortic SIRT-1 activation and
reversing age-related increases in aortic oxidative stress, collagen
deposition and elastin fragmentation29. Based on these preclinical
studies, it is possible that NR may similarly affect BP and aortic

 stiffness in humans through a mechanism involving SIRT-1
activation; however, future mechanistic studies are needed to test
this and related hypotheses. Such studies will be technically
challenging in humans, and it will be important to try to separate
the effects of SIRT-1 activation from the likely pleotropic effects
of boosting the NAD+ metabolome.
In addition to cardiovascular parameters, we also assessed the
effect of NR on other domains of physiological function. Our
findings suggest that a relatively short (6-week) intervention with
NR did not change total energy expenditure or energy expendi-
ture from fat oxidation (based on assessment of RER) at rest. We
also did not observe any improvement in blood glucose control or
insulin sensitivity. In both cases, it is important to note that this
study was conducted in lean, healthy middle-aged and older
adults without baseline metabolic dysfunction. These observa-
tions are in agreement with previous findings that NR modulates
resting metabolic rate only in mice exposed to a high-fat diet57,
and does not influence blood glucose regulation in animals fed
normal chow diets58. Based on these preclinical observations, it is
possible that chronic NR supplementation might improve meta-
bolic function in groups who consume unhealthy diets and/or
have metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and/or the
metabolic syndrome.
Our results also suggest that NR does not obviously improve
aerobic exercise capacity or motor function in healthy middle-
aged and older men and women with good baseline physical
status. Although Frederick et al.28 recently identified a role for
NAD+ in rescuing neuromuscular function and exercise capacity
in mice, these studies were conducted using a genetically induced
model of impaired NAD+ bioavailability that may represent more
severe NAD+ depletion than that which occurs with healthy
aging. Future studies should explore the role of NR supple-
mentation on aerobic exercise capacity and motor performance in
groups with impaired mobility such as frail older adults and in
individuals with chronic diseases associated with reduced cardi-
orespiratory fitness and exercise intolerance.
In summary, the results of the present study provide initial
evidence that chronic NR supplementation is well-tolerated in
healthy middle-aged and older adults, and extend recent find-
ings that acute supplementation with NR is effective for sti-
mulating NAD+ metabolism in humans. Furthermore, we
provide the first insight into the effects of NR supplementation
on physiological function in humans, and identify SBP and
aortic stiffness as promising cardiovascular outcomes to be
assessed in larger-scale clinical trials. Future work should also
compare the relative increases in NAD+ and the physiological
benefits of NR with conventional CR in order to further eval-
uate the use of this dietary supplement as a true “CR-mimetic”
compound.
Finally, we wish to emphasize certain limitations of this initial
trial on chronic NR supplementation in humans. Because the
physiological outcomes in this study were designed to be
exploratory in nature, the associated statistical inferences for
those variables were based on one-sided hypothesis testing and
the alpha level was set at a conservative P < 0.006 to account for
multiple testing. More targeted studies (e.g., phase-II clinical
trials) with fewer outcomes based on two-sided statistical infer-
ence are needed to confirm the effects of NR supplementation on
SBP and carotid-femoral PWV (aortic stiffness) before moving
towards larger-scale (phase-III) clinical trials and any recom-
mendation of NR supplementation for improving these cardio-
vascular health indicators. It is also important to note that
although NR is presently available as a dietary supplement under
the trade name NIAGEN® (ChromaDex, Inc.), the dose tested in
the present study exceeds the label-recommended dose and
should be considered investigational until further work can be
performed to confirm the safety and efficacy of higher doses for
use by the general population. Lastly, the present study assessed
the influence of chronic NR supplementation on healthy middle-
aged and older adults, which may have reduced the likelihood of
observing greater or, in the case of several outcomes assessed, any
improvements in physiological function. Thus, future investiga-
tions should include studies on groups with cardio-metabolic
diseases, motor deficits, impaired NAD+ metabolism, and/or
other disorders to determine the efficacy of NR supplementation
for enhancing health status in populations with impaired baseline
physiological function.
Methods
Ethical approval, informed consent, and study location. All procedures were
approved by the University of Colorado Boulder Institutional Review Board. The
nature, benefits, and risks of the study were explained to all subjects, and their
written informed consent was obtained prior to participation. All measurements
were performed at the University of Colorado Boulder Clinical & Translational
Research Center (CTRC) and in the Integrative Physiology of Aging Laboratory.
The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT02921659.
Study participants. Middle-aged and older men and postmenopausal women aged
55−79 years were recruited from Boulder Colorado and surrounding communities.
All subjects were free of clinical diseases, including peripheral artery disease (ankle-
brachial index >0.90) and overt CVD as assessed by a graded exercise test, baseline
blood panel, medical history, and physical examination by a physician. All subjects
demonstrated age-related impairments in vascular endothelial function (defined as
a flow-mediated dilation value <6%) and were excluded if they exhibited abnormal
blood chemistries for renal or liver function (defined as 1 standard deviation
outside of the normal range), had alcohol dependence, uncontrolled thyroid dis-
ease, severe obesity (body mass index >40 kg m−2), or were not weight stable for at
least 3 months prior to enrolling in the study (defined as >2 kg change in body
mass). Body mass, BMI, and waist and hip circumferences were measured by
anthropometry, and total body fat percentage was measured using dual-energy x-
ray absorptiometry (Lunar/Prodigy, GE). Fasting glucose and total, LDL, and HDL
cholesterol levels were measured using standardized assays at the University of
Colorado Boulder CTRC Core Laboratory at baseline and after each intervention
phase of the study.
Study design, randomization, and intervention. The study design consisted of a
2 × 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial.
Subjects ingested nicotinamide riboside chloride (NIAGEN®; 500 mg, twice per day;
ChromaDex, Inc.) and placebo capsules for 6 weeks each in a randomly determined
order. Subjects were randomized after providing informed consent and meeting all
inclusion criteria. Randomization was performed by a member of the study team
not involved in the assessment of outcomes. The study participants and members of
the study team involved in the collection and analysis of outcomes were blinded to
the treatment condition. Capsules were consumed with meals in the morning and
evening. Subjects refrained from taking any over-the-counter medications for 48 h
and prescription medications for 24 h prior to all experimental testing. All assess-
ments were performed after a 12 h overnight fast with the exception of motor
function tests, which were performed 2 h after a light meal or snack in order to
ensure that subjects had enough energy to complete the testing battery. Subjects
refrained from consuming alcohol or engaging in vigorous exercise for 24 h and
refrained from taking study pills for at least 12 h prior to all testing sessions.
Evaluation of safety and tolerability. Adherence to the intervention was assessed
by pill count. Subjects reported to the laboratory every 2 weeks to receive a new
bottle of capsules and to discuss any issues with tolerability or treatment-emergent
AEs with a member of the research team who was not involved in data collection or
analysis in order to ensure blinding of the investigators. Standard clinical markers
of hematology, liver and kidney function and blood lipids were analyzed using
standardized clinical assays at Boulder Community Hospital and any abnormal
blood results were reviewed by the study physician.
Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. PBMCs were isolated from 35
ml of whole blood collected into EDTA-coated Vacutainer™ tubes. The blood was
then centrifuged at 400 × g for 20 min and the majority of the plasma layer (~60%)
was removed to increase the efficiency of the downstream PBMC isolation. The
remaining sample was slowly added to a new 50 ml conical tube containing 10 ml
of Histopaque 1.077 (Greiner Bio-One) and the mononuclear cell layer was isolated
by density-dependent centrifugation at 400 × g for 20 min, washed and then frozen
in 2 ml of PBS at −80°C.
Materials. NAAD, NAD+, NADP+, NaM, NmN, mono-, di- and triphosphate
nucleotides and nucleosides were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

 Adenosine (ribose-13C5) and adenosine triphosphate (ribose-d4) were obtained
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Tewksbury, MA). NaM (13C6) was
obtained from Cerilliant (Round Rock, TX). Nicotinamide riboside and doubly
labeled nicotinamide riboside (13C1, H2-1) were obtained from ChromaDex Inc.
(Irvine, CA). All HPLC solvents and extraction solvents were HPLC grade or
better.
Preparation of calibration standards. Individual stock standards were prepared
by dissolving 10 mg ml−1 in 1:1 methanol:water and then combining to obtain a
stock mixture. The NAD+ metabolite combined stock was prepared at 100 μg ml−1
of each compound and the nucleoside/nucleotide combined stock was prepared at
400 μg ml−1 of each compound; both were frozen at −20 °C until use. The internal
standard solution was prepared at 250 μg/ml adenosine-13C5, adenosine tripho-
sphate-d4, doubly labeled nicotinamide riboside and 2.5 μg ml−1 of NaM-13C6 in
1:1 methanol:water. Immediately before analysis of each sample batch, the indi-
vidual calibration curve standards were prepared by combining the NAD+ and
nucleoside/nucleotide stocks at a ratio of 1:1 and then diluting them in 1:1
methanol:water to the required concentrations. Concentrations ranged from 0.025
to 25 μg ml−1 for the NAD+ metabolites and from 0.1 to 100 μg ml−1 for
nucleosides/nucleotides. Internal standard concentrations in all calibration levels
and samples were 50 μg ml−1 for adenosine-13C5, adenosine triphosphate-d4 and
doubly labeled nicotinamide riboside, and 0.5 μg ml−1 for NaM-13C6.
Extraction of NAD+ metabolites and nucleosides/nucleotides. Frozen PBMCs
(5×10E6 cells total) were thawed on ice. 500 μl of ice cold 70:30 methanol:water was
added along with 20 μl of internal standard and samples vortexed for 10 s. The
resulting extract was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting
supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube and stored on ice. To the
remaining pellet, 500 μl of ice cold methanol was added and the sample vortexed
for 10 s to resuspend the pellet. The sample was then centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5
min at 4 °C. The entire supernatant was removed and combined with the 70%
methanol supernatant. The resulting pellet was reserved and frozen at −70 °C for
protein concentration analysis using the Bradford assay. The combined super-
natants were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min and the resulting supernatant was
transferred to a new tube and dried in a vacuum centrifuge at 55 °C. The dried
samples were reconstituted in 100 μl of 1:1 methanol:water and centrifuged at
18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then transferred to a reduced
surface activity autosampler vial for analysis.
LC-MS. HPLC separation of NAD+ metabolites and nucleosides/nucleotides was
performed using a method described by Evans et al.59 with minor modifications.
Separation of NAD+ metabolites and nucleosides/nucleotides was performed on a
1200 series HPLC from Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) using a 100 × 2 mm 5 μm Luna
NH2 column from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA) operated in HILIC mode. Buffer
A consisted of 100% acetonitrile and buffer B consisted of 95:5 water with 20 mM
ammonium acetate adjusted to pH 9.6 with 20 mM ammonium hydroxide. Ten
microliters of the extracted sample was analyzed using the following gradient at a
flow rate of 0.6 ml per min: linear gradient from 5 to 100% B over 6 min, hold at
100% B from 6 to 9.5 min, then 100−5% B from 9.5 to 10.5 min, followed by re-
equilibration at 5% B from 10.5 to 14 min. The column temperature was held at 15
°C for the entire gradient. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on an
Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive ionization mode. The
drying gas was 300 °C at a flow rate of 12 ml per min. The nebulizer pressure was
30 psi. The capillary voltage was 4000 V. Data for NAD+ metabolites and
nucleosides/nucleotides were acquired in MRM mode using experimentally opti-
mized conditions obtained by flow injection analysis of authentic standards
(Supplementary Table 5). Calibration standards were analyzed over a range of
concentrations from 0.25 to 250 ng on column for the NAD+ metabolites and from
1 to 1000 ng on column for nucleosides/nucleotides. Calibration curves for each
NAD+ metabolite and nucleoside/nucleotide were constructed using Agilent
Masshunter Quantitative Analysis software. Results for PBMCs were quantitated
using the calibration curves to obtain the on-column concentration, followed by
normalization of the results using the protein concentration of the pellet reserved
from the PBMC extraction.
Assessments of cardiovascular function. Resting blood pressure was measured
in the seated position after at least 10 min of quiet rest using a semi-automated
blood pressure device (Dynamap™ XL, Johnson & Johnson, Arlington, TX, USA).
Measurements were made multiple times from the non-dominant arm, with 2 min
of quiet rest between recordings. Repeat measurements were made until three
blood pressure values were obtained that were within 5 mmHg of one another.
These values were then averaged to determine resting systolic and diastolic blood
pressure and pulse pressure. Baseline blood pressure values were obtained using the
above-described protocol on two separate testing days prior to the initiation of the
first intervention arm and were averaged to determine baseline blood pressure
status (i.e., normal vs. above normal) for subsequent analyses.
Aortic stiffness was measured using carotid-to-femoral PWV, the gold-standard
assessment of elastic artery stiffness in humans38. Pressure waveforms were
recorded simultaneously from the carotid and femoral arteries using applanation
tonometry (Millar Inc., Houston, Texas) as previously described by our
laboratory60–62. The transit time of the aortic pulse wave was determined by
measuring the time-delay between the foot of the carotid and femoral pressure
waves using LabChart analysis software. PWV was calculated by dividing the
distance between the two measurement sites by the aortic transit time.
Carotid artery compliance was determined by the change in diameter of the
right common carotid artery (assessed using high resolution ultrasonography,
PowerVision 6000, Toshiba) relative to the change in carotid blood pressure
(assessed using applanation tonometry, Millar Inc., Houston, TX) across the
cardiac cycle. Carotid pressure was normalized to brachial artery pressure obtained
using an automated blood pressure cuff (Dynamap™ XL, Johnson & Johnson,
Arlington, TX, USA). Compliance was calculated as CC = π × DD2 × (ΔD DD−1)/
(2 × PP), where DD is diastolic diameter, ΔD is the change in diameter and PP is
the arterial pulse pressure, as has been described previously62–65.
Endothelium dependent dilation was measured as brachial artery flow-mediated
dilation (FMD) to reactive hyperemia, using high-resolution ultrasonography
(PowerVision 6000, Toshiba) as previously described66–68. FMD was expressed as
the percentage change (%Δ) from baseline diameter.
Assessments of metabolic function. Three-day dietary records were collected at
baseline and during the last week of each intervention phase to ensure stability of
caloric intake. Results were analyzed by a registered dietician using the Nutrition
Data System for Research (University of Minnesota) as previously described by our
laboratory67,69.
Resting metabolic rate was measured by indirect calorimetry (ParvoMedics
TrueOne 2400) as described previously by our laboratory70,71. Subjects rested in a
supine position for 45–60 min with a ventilated hood placed over their head to
collect concentrations of expired oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Metabolic
rate and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were calculated in 1-min segments and
averaged from at least 30 min of steady data.
Insulin sensitivity was assessed by measuring insulin-stimulated whole-body
glucose uptake using a modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance
test and the Minimal Model Method of analysis as described in detail elsewhere72.
Insulin resistance and beta cell sensitivity were assessed using the homeostasis
model assessment (HOMA) method as previously described73.
Assessments of exercise capacity and physical function. Cardiorespiratory
fitness was determined from a graded treadmill exercise test to volitional exhaus-
tion using a modified Balke protocol as previously described74. Oxygen con-
sumption (VO2) and RER were measured using open-circuit spirometry with an
online, computer-assisted analysis system. Heart rate and ratings of perceived
exertion (RPE) were also measured throughout the test.
Walking endurance was assessed by measuring the distance covered during a 6-
min walking task on a 50-foot (out-and-back) indoor course as previously
described75.
Muscle strength and rate of torque development were quantified by measuring
the peak force produced during a maximal voluntary contraction, and rate of
torque development was measured using the maximal rate of developing torque
during a rapid, forceful contraction of the knee flexor and extensor muscles as
previously described by our laboratory76. Handgrip strength was measured using a
standard handgrip dynamometer.
Leg fatigability was assessed using performance until failure during a single-leg
heel-rise task. Subjects were asked to perform one complete plantar flexion
contraction every 2 s until failure, and the test was terminated when the subject
voluntarily stopped due to discomfort or inability to achieve at least 50% of
maximal plantar flexion without using upper extremities for more than balance77.
The chronic attribute of fatigue was also assessed using a Fatigue Questionnaire
and Fatigue Severity Scale78.
Dynamic balance was assessed using a rapid step test. Maximal step length was
measured in each direction (forward, backward, left, right), and targets were placed
on the ground at 80% of the subject’s maximum with lines of colored tape, as
described previously79. Performance was quantified as the time taken and number
of errors committed on average during three rounds of the rapid step balance test.
Each round consisted of 18 commands instructing subjects to step with a random
foot to a random direction (i.e. left front). An error was defined as failure to
completely step beyond the target, loss of balance, failure to return to the initial
starting position, taking multiple steps to completely reach a target, or stepping
with the incorrect leg or to the wrong target.
Mobility was assessed as the time to complete a 4-m walk task (performed in
duplicate at the subjects' preferred walking speed) and the five-repeated sit-to-stand
test (performed in triplicate), as previously described75,78,80. The test involves
rising from a seated position in a standard-height chair five times, as quickly as
possible, without using their arms for momentum or support.
Manual dexterity was assessed as the time to complete a 9-hole pegboard test as
previously described76. Subjects collected smooth, rounded pegs from a dish and
placed them into a pegboard, then returned them to the dish as quickly as possible.
Two trials were completed with each hand.
Statistical analyses. The sample size for this study was sufficient to detect at least
a 50% increase in NAD+ concentration following NR supplementation vs. placebo

 (effect size = 0.7; mean of difference = 7; 1−β = 0.8; α = 0.05) as well as a clinically
relevant improvement in the cardiovascular parameter with the lowest effect size
(FMD; mean difference = >1%; effect size = 0.86). Estimate of effect size for NAD+
was determined from preliminary data of NAD+ metabolite concentrations in
PBMCs collected from human subjects. Effect size for FMD was determined from
our laboratory’s previous crossover interventions demonstrating improvements in
vascular function67. The required sample size was determined to be 19 subjects.
Assuming a 20% dropout (4 subjects) and 40% exclusion due to screen failures
(consistent with other intervention studies in our laboratory using dietary
supplements81,82), a total of 60 participants were consented for this study. Sig-
nificance was set at α = 0.006 for all secondary outcomes to adjust for multiple
testing of NR vs. placebo (paired t-tests) on each of the following nine pre-
specified hypotheses: (1) NAD+ metabolites, (2) cardiovascular parameters, (3)
hematology, (4) metabolic panel, (5) lipid profiles, (6) energy balance, (7) gly-
cemic control, (8) motor function and (9) exercise performance. Because many
of the measures within each hypothesis are correlated with one another (e.g.,
cardiovascular measures, Supplemental Table 9), each group of measures listed
above was treated as one outcome when adjusting for multiple comparisons.
With the exception of our primary outcome variables (NAD+ metabolites: NAD
+, NAAD, NADP, NaM, NMN), in which inferences were based on an unad-
justed alpha level set at 0.05, all inferences of significance are based on the
Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level (α = 0.006).
The intent of this study was to translate promising preclinical evidence for the
efficacy of chronic supplementation with NAD+ boosting compounds to humans.
Therefore, each outcome was tested under a directional hypothesis that was
determined a priori, based upon previous studies reported in the literature.
Accordingly, one-tailed hypothesis tests were used to compare the proposed
unidirectional effects of NR supplementation vs. placebo on these outcomes. This
method has been recommended elsewhere for Phase I and II placebo-controlled
clinical trials in which the goal is to gain early insight into the potential efficacy of a
compound83.
Prior to analysis, all continuous outcome variables were assessed for
normality using the Shapiro−Wilk test and by examining individual frequency
histograms for each outcome. If a variable was non-normally distributed, it was
log-transformed prior to analysis. If log-transformation did not normalize the
data, treatment condition was analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon
signed rank test. For each variable, any subject with a missing value during either
phase was excluded from that analysis. Based on the interpretation of the
primary data, post-hoc analyses were performed to compare the change in blood
pressure and aortic stiffness between subjects who exhibited normal vs. above
normal baseline blood pressure using an un-paired two-tailed t-test. We also
explored the relation between baseline NAD+ concentrations and the overall
increase in NAD+ using a Pearson correlation. A formal washout period was not
included in the study design; however, given the crossover design, we tested for
presence of a carryover effect for each of the outcomes under study using linear
regression modeled with an indicator for treatment order (no carryover effects
were observed between conditions). All statistical analyses were performed using
the R statistical computing platform (version 3.2.2) and GraphPad Prism
7 software.
