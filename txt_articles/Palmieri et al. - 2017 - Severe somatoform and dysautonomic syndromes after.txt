Abstract Human papilloma virus (HPV) is recognized as a major cause for cervical
cancer among women worldwide. Two HPV vaccines are currently available: Gardasil�
and Cervarix�. Both vaccines enclose viral antigenic proteins, but differ as to the bio-
logical systems of culture and the adjuvant components. Recently, a collection of
symptoms, indicating nervous system dysfunction, has been described after HPV vacci-
nation. We retrospectively described a case series including 18 girls (aged 12–24 years)
referred to our ‘‘Second Opinion Medical Network’’ for the evaluation of ‘‘neuropathy
with autonomic dysfunction’’ after HPV vaccination. All girls complained of long-lasting
and invalidating somatoform symptoms (including asthenia, headache, cognitive dysfunctions, myalgia, sinustachycardia and
skin rashes) that have developed 1–5 days (n = 11), 5–15 days (n = 5) and 15–20 days (n = 2) after the vaccination. These
cases can be included in the recently described immune dysfunction named autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by
adjuvants (ASIA). HPV vaccine, through its adjuvant component, is speculated to induce an abnormal activation of the
immune system, involving glia cells in the nervous system too. Further researches should aim at defining the pathological and
clinical aspects of these post-vaccination diseases and identifying a genetic background predisposing to these adverse
reactions.

Introduction
Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection has been recog-
nized to have a significant role in the occurrence and
progression of several tumours, such as cervical cancer,
representing one of the most common malignancies among
women worldwide [1].
Following this discovery, some vaccines have been
produced to prevent such a sexually transmitted infection,
against the most frequently involved serotypes, namely
HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16 and HPV-18. Particularly, the
latter two have been estimated to account for 70 % of cases
of cervical cancer [2].
Currently, two HPV vaccines are available on the mar-
ket: Gardasil� (a quadrivalent vaccine covering serotypes

bivalent vaccine against HPV-16 and HPV-18) in 2009.
Both vaccines enclose self-assembled antigenic pentamers
of L1 proteins, produced by DNA recombinant technology,
but differ as to the biological system of culture and the
adjuvant components, as summarized in Table 1. Gardasil�
is produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, and viral
antigens are pooled with the adjuvant aluminium hydrox-
yphosphate sulphate (225 lg). Cervarix� is obtained
through
a
L1-recombinant
baculovirus-infected
insect
(Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9, Trichoplusia ni Hi-5), and the
adjuvant component is represented by ASO4 complex that
is made of aluminium hydroxide and Salmonella min-
nesota lipopolysaccharide extract. The intramuscular (IM)
administration protocol
encompasses three bimonthly
injections that elicit a strong persisting antibody titre
against HPV serotypes over six months and a good control
of its related infection [3–5].
So far, more than 100 million HPV vaccine doses have
been administered worldwide and it has been shown to
provide protective and long-lasting antibody titres against
the virus. The largest study investigating the safety of HPV
vaccine included almost 300,000 young girls administered
with nearly 700,000 doses of the quadrivalent vaccine: no
increases in the number of cases of autoimmune and/or
neurological diseases were detected. Moreover, a pooled
analysis of five clinical trials involving 11,778 quadrivalent
HPV vaccinated people and 9686 placebo-treated controls,
aged 9–26 years, showed that 0.2 % of both vaccine and
placebo recipients had dropped out because of adverse drug
reactions (ADRs). Most dropouts occurred after the first
dose and the most severe cases were due to autoimmu-
nity; however, those events affected equally the vaccine
and placebo groups [6–18].
The temporal relationship between the vaccination and the
development of immune-mediated diseases raised the issue of
the possible aetiological or co-causative role of such an im-
munization procedure, which may occur in patients with a
genetic predisposition. Moreover, long-standing neurological
and/or psychiatric symptoms after HPV vaccine being
refractory to any treatment elicited further concerns [19–21].
Recently, these ADRs have been pooled in a heteroge-
neous group of medical conditions (including also Gulf
War syndrome, macrophagic myofasciitis, siliconosis, sick
building
syndrome)
named
autoimmune/inflammatory
syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). The common
feature of different ASIA clinical conditions is considered
to be the previous exposure to an external stimulus (in-
cluding vaccines) triggering an undefined immune-medi-
ated response elicited by its adjuvant properties [22–25].
Here an incidental finding of a small cluster of young
females with severe and persistent neurological and/or
psychiatric symptoms arising after HPV vaccination led us
to review critically this issue.

 Case series
In 2015, through our ‘‘Second Opinion Medical Network’’,
we have been asked for evaluating a girl with cervical
lymphadenitis, headache, severe persistent fibromyalgia-
like pain, paresthaesia, chronic fatigue, insomnia, cognitive
impairment, abnormal menstrual cycles and fingers/toes
vascular abnormalities (changes in skin colour and tem-
perature perception). Such a clinical picture was defined
(by the neurologists evaluating the patient) as ‘‘neuropathy
with autonomic dysfunction’’. Later, some other families
from Northern and Central Italy, whose daughters had been
complaining of similar symptoms after HPV vaccination,
were referred to our centre through the mother of this first
patient. That fact allowed us to visit and analyse a case
series including 18 young girls aged 12–24 years who
developed post-vaccination phenomena after receiving
Gardasil� (n = 9) or Cervarix� (n = 9). Patients’ and
immunization features are reported in Table 2. An over-
view of the clinical manifestations considering the tem-
poral association with HPV immunization is reported in
Table 3. Current and persisting clinical problems are
summarized in Table 4.
Results
Eighteen girls (aged 12–24 years, current mean age being
15.2 years) have been included in this case series. As
concerns their past personal history, all of them reported
chickenpox during childhood, and some had mononucle-
osis (n = 4), scarlet fever (n = 2), fifth disease (n = 2)
or CMV-related eruption (n = 1). During childhood,
eight patients received the MMR (measles, mumps and
rubella) vaccine, in addition to the regular immunization
schedule administered at that time, including at least
DTP, poliomyelitis and HBV. Nine girls were vaccinated
against HPV via the quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil�),
between January 2008 and December 2015, and nine
girls received HPV-16/18 vaccine (Cervarix�) between
January 2008 and December 2015 (Cervarix�). The mean
age
at
HPV
immunization
was
11
and
12 years
(Table 2).
The ADRs described in Table 3 occurred after the first
IM injection in four girls, after the second dose in eight
patients and after the third boost in six of them. As
expected, the first two groups refused the following doses
of the HPV immunization protocol. Based upon the time
interval between vaccination and symptoms onset, we
divided our patients in three groups (Table 3): (1) girls
whose
symptoms
appeared
1–5 days
post-vaccination
(n = 11), (2) girls whose symptoms appeared 5–15 days
after the vaccination (n = 5) and (3) girls whose symptoms
occurred 15–20 days post-vaccination (n = 2).
Local ADRs were also reported: pain at the injection site
(n = 5), involuntary movement at the injection arm,
especially hand tremor (n = 1), swelling (n = 2).
The systemic reactions observed 1–5 days after the
vaccination consisted in low-grade fever (n = 9), headache
(n = 12), recurrent syncope (n = 7), persistent convulsive
hunger (n = 1), irritability (n = 3),
epileptic
seizures
(n = 1),

paresthaesia and paresis (n = 1), hot flushes (n = 1),
severe stomach pain (n = 4), insomnia (n = 5), hyper-
sensitivity reactions (e.g. itchy skin rash, rhinitis) (n = 1),
muscle pain (n = 5), severe gait impairment and ortho-
static intolerance (n = 1), excessive sweating (n = 1),
vomiting (n = 1).

 Clinical manifestations occurring 5–15 days after vac-
cination were asthenia (n = 8), excessive thirst (n = 3),
severe hands and feet itching (n = 1), optic neuritis
(n = 1). Finally, other patients complained of symptoms
after 15–20 days after vaccination: amenorrhoea (n = 1),
skin rashes (n = 2), tachycardia (n = 2), difficult breath-
ing (n = 1), weight loss (n = 3).
Among the most common and persistent symptoms
(Table 4), the patients complained of memory and concen-
tration impairment (n = 17), muscle pain (n = 13), finger and
toes vascular abnormalities with skin colour and temperature
changes (n = 13), headache (n = 12), asthenia (n = 9),

(n = 3), sinus tachycardia (n = 2), skin rashes (n = 1).
Discussion
Immunization practice definitely modified the epidemiol-
ogy of human infectious diseases since its introduction
some centuries ago: indeed, a dramatic reduction of the
morbidity and/or mortality in the populations recruited by

 mass vaccine campaigns was obtained [26, 27]. Despite
these positive achievements, concerns on safety emerged
from a number of clinical reports describing post-vacci-
nation polymorphous phenomena [23, 28].
However,
available
studies
reported
no
statistical
association between vaccines (including those against
HPV) and the incidence of autoimmune diseases, except
for a few and well-defined situations [29, 30]. In the past,
for
instance,
Guillain–Barre
`
syndrome
was
causally
associated with the swine influenza vaccination campaign
of 1976–1977. Currently, idiopathic thrombocytopenic
purpura (ITP) has been related to vaccination against
MMR, but the wild and natural viral infections resulted to
have a tenfold greater risk to develop ITP, which sup-
ported the vaccination practice anyway. Similar observa-
tions have been made for other immune-mediated diseases
following several vaccinations. Thus, the available evi-
dence suggested that vaccines should not be considered a
risk factor leading to a greater occurrence of well-defined
immune-mediated and neurological diseases, compared to
the natural infections that vaccines aim at preventing
[23, 31, 32].
Moreover, both the use of standardized protocols and the
coordinated surveillance by the regulatory drug agencies
have currently erased vaccine-related diseases due to
malpractice (e.g. infected materials, incomplete inactiva-
tion of infectious agents, gross errors of administration).
Obviously, despite the best medical practice, vaccines as
any other drug, can display unforeseen side effects: these
intrinsic risks are relatively rare and are considered
acceptable in front of the health benefits produced in terms
of life quality and expectancy. Moreover, the warnings to
avoid vaccinations in people with allergies to some com-
ponents, with history of previous ADRs and with transient
(e.g. during pregnancy) or permanent (e.g. severe primary
and secondary immunodeficiency) impairment of the
immune system, substantially reduced the incidence of
complications [33]. Unfortunately, unpredicted ADRs still
occur and the individual genetic background has been
supposed to be responsible for these phenomena, including
autoimmune diseases and/or neurological/psychiatric syn-
dromes, without a specific or identifiable pathologic alter-
ation. Recently, some authors reasoned that all these
heterogeneous post-vaccination phenomena might be the
consequence of some immune dysfunction, putatively
activated by the adjuvant rather than by antigenic vaccine
fractions. Thus, they named these medical conditions as
ASIA [34, 35].
The adjuvant is devoted to enhance the immune response
to the sensitizing molecules (antigens or haptens); yet they
may contain some pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) and/or create a mild tissue injury exposing some
damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are
recognized by the innate immune system through specific
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [21, 36–38].
If autoimmune or immune-mediated phenomena were
related
to
a
vaccination, the
cross-reactive
adaptive
immune response to both antigenic and adjuvant compo-
nents of vaccine might be considered. Therefore, at the site
of injection, at afferent lymph nodes or also at distant
organs, autoreactive immune processes may be activated
by the vaccine adjuvant and not only by the antigenic part
of the vaccine. The central and peripheral nervous system
has been supposed to be one of the targets of this
autoimmune reaction, leading to neurological and/or psy-
chiatric symptoms, diagnosed as being ASIA, in some
(genetically) predisposed individuals [37–40].
Our case series included a wide spectrum of post-vac-
cination general, neurological and psychiatric symptoms
during and/or early after the scheduled HPV immunization.
Most patients showed an ‘‘acute phase’’ characterized by a
variable combination of clinical manifestations, including
low-grade fever, skin rashes, muscle pain, headache and
sensorial disturbances. Its onset occurred at a variable time
after HPV immunization, ranging from hours to days.
Then, this acute phase subsided in some weeks, but the
girls developed some chronic and/or recurrent symptoms
resembling chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia or other func-
tional somatic syndromes. The clinical pictures displayed
by each patient were actually polymorphous, except for
asthenia, concentration problems, sensorial impairment
(related to temperature perception, especially), recurrent or
persisting muscle pain, paresis and headache. Previously,
all these girls declared excellent fitness and wellness,

 including sport practice. No significant co-morbidities or
previous relevant diseases were reported before the HPV
immunization.
Currently, the diagnosis of ASIA is based upon the
criteria proposed by Shoenfeld [39, 41], as reported in
Table 5. It can be diagnosed whether two major criteria or
one major and two minor criteria have been ascertained. In
our case series, one of the major criteria is satisfied by
definition, as all patients are joined by the exposure to HPV
vaccine, as an external stimulus endowed of adjuvant
properties. As summarized in Table 6, all patients pre-
sented at least one more of the major criteria and/or two
minor criteria, making a diagnosis of ASIA be consistent.
The description of our case series aimed at analysing
clinical phenomena, being putatively immune mediated and
arising after HPV immunization. The latency of the onset of
symptoms is quite variable, but it can be consistent with the
occurrence of cell-mediated and/or antibody response
against some neurological/neuromuscular structures.
The majority of post-vaccination ADRs were consistent
with severe fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndrome,
according to the literature criteria.
Because of these symptoms, at least 10 of these eighteen
young girls developed a long-standing social impairment
(school absence, sport suspension and daily activity
impairment).
Certainly, the diagnostic criteria for ASIA need to be
improved and this medical category requires a better
clinical, immunological and, possibly, genetic definition.
Indeed, in addition to the aforementioned diagnostic cri-
teria, the diagnosis is currently supported by a strict tem-
poral association with the onset of symptoms and, of
course, by the exclusion of other well-defined infectious,
immune-mediated and oncologic diseases. ASIA is thought
to represent an infrequent side effect of vaccinations due to
an adjuvant or adjuvant-like stimulus acting on a predis-
posed, but not well-defined, genetic background [39].
Because of its rarity, its heterogeneous clinical expression
and the frequent absence of objective pathological lesions
and immunological signatures, ASIA might have escaped
to pre-clinical and post-marketing safety studies on vac-
cines. Indeed, the definition of ASIA as post-vaccination
event originated by a study by Zafrir and co-workers on
patients affected with Gulf War syndrome who had
received HBV immunization [42].
Among commercialized vaccines, those against HPV
have received a lot of descriptions of medical conditions
being consistent with the diagnosis of ASIA, regardless the
type of vaccine. Recently, Pellegrino et al. carried out an
interesting analysis of HPV vaccine-related ASIA epidemi-
ology in the vaccine adverse event reporting system
(VAERS), which is a large database collecting almost 30,000
post-vaccination ADRs per year. Pooling the data until the
end of 2013, the authors reported more than 26,000 ADRs
after HPV vaccine: of these, about 8 % have been labelled as
being probable or possible ASIA, according to the Shoenfeld

 and Agmon-Levin’s guideline for the diagnosis. A strong
causality evaluation between HPV vaccination and ASIA
has been supposed in this study [43]. Unfortunately, most
descriptions of HPV post-vaccination phenomena consistent
with ASIA have been single cases and small case series,
where only the temporal link was evident.

 (MHRA) investigated the association between bivalent
HPV vaccine and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) that is
considered one of the main expressions or evolution of
ASIA. No increase of CFS incidence was noticed in girls
aged 12–20 years old after the introduction of such an
immunization [44].
Moreover, in 2015, the European Medicine Agency
(EMA) revised the safety profile of HPV vaccines as
regards the occurrence of complex regional pain syndrome
(CRPS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
(POTS).
Such
a
revision
was
carried
out
through
the Pharmacovigilance
Risk
Assessment
Committee
(PRAC) and the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine
Safety (GACVS), which were not able to find enough
scientific evidence so far to support a clear causal link
between HPV vaccine and the aforementioned syndromes
and, thus, to alter the current recommendations for HPV
immunization programme [45].
These studies were prompted by the burden of reports
regarding syncope, asthenia and pain syndromes occurring
after HPV immunization [46, 47]. Recently, Martinez-
Lavin published an interesting clinical report where two
girls have developed severe incapacitating fibromyalgia-
like illness, after one and two doses of HPV inoculation,
respectively [48].
This same author speculated that post-vaccination
fibromyalgia, POTS and CRPS might be due to a dysau-
tonomia, precisely a sympathetic nervous system dys-
function, because of a small fibre neuropathy triggered by
the HPV immunization in susceptible people. Actually,
such a hypothesis has been endorsed by Kinoshita et al.
[49], who described a case series of 44 girls (aged
11–17 years) complaining of several symptoms after HPV
immunization. Interestingly, in addition to headache, gen-
eral fatigue, limb pain and coldness, most patients showed
signs of vascular instability at the extremities, including a
slight to moderate decrease of toes and fingers temperature,
as many patients of our case series did.
The
aforementioned
EMA
investigation
had
been
prompted mainly by a retrospective analysis (carried out in
Denmark) on 53 patients developing orthostatic intolerance
and other symptoms consistent with autonomic dysfunction
within two months after the quadrivalent HPV vaccination
[50].
The
authors
stated
a
recognizable
pattern
of
somatoform symptoms (headache, localized or diffuse
neuropathic pain, dysautonomic disturbances, excessive
fatigue and cognitive dysfunctions), where different clini-
cal entities, namely POTS, CRPS, fibromyalgia and CFS,
could be included. ASIA might be the diagnostic category
including all these syndromes, but the inclusion criteria
should be substantiated through further studies providing
new insights into its neuropathic pathophysiology and
adjuvant-triggered/immune-mediated pathogenesis. In this
perspective, the first and mandatory step could be focusing
the epidemiology of these post-vaccination phenomena and
selecting/collecting an appropriate study population of girls
complaining of this pattern of symptoms. Martinez-Lavin
et al. recently published the results of questionnaires pro-
posed to 45 patients developing chronic disturbances
within 3 months after HPV vaccination, by means of three
validated self-applied questionnaires evaluating the dif-
ferent groups of symptoms described after HPV immu-
nization or, more in general, in ASIA patients: (1) the 2010
ACR Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria Survey; (2) the
COMPASS-31 test, exploring the autonomic dysfunction;
(3) the S-LANSS questionnaire, evaluating the neuropathic
component in pain syndromes [51]. We suggest drawing a
specific
questionnaire
summarizing
all
these
clinical
aspects, to be administered to all the subjects receiving
HPV vaccination in a perspective observational study.
Such an approach could provide certain data on the real
incidence of ASIA after HPV immunization, definitely
ruling out the potential bias deriving from pre-existing
subjective complaints. Then, a standardized and interna-
tional consensus protocol of investigation ought to be
planned on these identified cohorts of patients, in order to
clarify the existence and the mechanisms of this puzzling
syndrome.
Although
no
cause/effect
evidence
between
HPV
immunization and non-organic symptoms has been detec-
ted so far, the strong burden of concerns expressed by the
parents’ associations from several European countries
should not be underscored at all.
A database of 35 young girls immunized against HPV
through Gardasil� between 2008 and 2013 in France, who
showed similar symptoms as our case series (and who
received also a final diagnosis of autoimmune disease in
some cases), was published by an independent parents’
association [52].
In Spain, the Asociacion de Afectadas pro la Vacuna del
Papiloma (AAVP) collected 42 cases from 2008 to 2014: in
addition to few cases of demyelinating/autoimmune dis-
eases, most patients developed somatoform/functional
disorders or not well-defined patterns of symptoms without
a final diagnosis [53].
Again, in the UK, another parents’ association, named
Association of HPV Vaccine Injured Daughters (AHVID),
currently counts 265 members: through a questionnaire
which has been responded to by almost 100 families so far,
variable patterns of neuropathic disorders, being labelled as
POTS, CRPS, CFS or fibromyalgia, were reported in most
cases [54].
All these alerting reports are not institutional and cannot
be reputed as systematic epidemiologic investigations;
however, in our opinion, they have to be taken into ade-
quate account to reach definite conclusions upon the
Environment and Autoimmunity (2017) 65:106–116

 relationship between HPV vaccines and ASIA/functional
somatoform diseases, through further studies. This will be
the only way to clarify the real risk of HPV vaccines, as
regards these specific health issues: that will help to retract
all potential and/or unfounded concerns related to HPV
immunization, and, thus, will reinforce the perception of
safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines among people all
over the world. Conversely, the identification of a geneti-
cally and/or immunologically cohort of young girls being
potentially exposed to these kinds of diseases might lead to
the selective exclusion from this immunization practice.
Indeed, like the UK Medicines and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and other European Phar-
macovigilance, other systems have been notified about this
kind of side effects regarding HPV vaccines. For instance,
the Netherland Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb received
1271 reports of Adverse Events Following Immunization
(AEFI) with Cervarix� since the introduction of the
National Immunization Programme in 2009, according to
the data analysis updated at December 2015: 231 reports
were
about
long-lasting
AEFI,
whose
duration
was
2 months or more, and most related complaints were per-
sistent/recurrent
fatigue,
headache,
dizziness,
muscu-
loskeletal discomfort and syncope [55]. Interestingly, after
consulting the available medical records and the healthcare
practitioners dealing with these patients, no medical
explanation for all these long-lasting AEFI was found.
According to this analysis, a causal relation between Cer-
varix� and the reported long-lasting AEFI could not be
concluded, but neither excluded, based upon the available
data. Previously, in 2013, the same institution edited an
overview of the reports on long-lasting fatigue following
immunization with Cervarix�. As many others, the authors
observed that the age of vaccinated girls had to be taken
into account as potential confounding factor, but they
concluded that additional epidemiological research was
needed anyway, in order to confirm or reject a causal link
[56]. It is well known that severe and/or long-lasting fati-
gue, like other somatoform symptoms, are not uncommon
in young females, but this issue could be ascertained
through an appropriate epidemiological and observational
investigation. The girls affected by these symptoms after
HPV immunization in our case series, as well as in data-
bases reported by parents’ associations, had been com-
pletely healthy and had never complained of fatigue or
somatoform symptoms before the administration of one or
more doses of the HPV vaccine.
A plan of prospective and specific epidemiological
studies, among active surveillance of post-vaccination
ADRs, addressed to face the HPV immunization major
concerns, was attempted in Italy through the National
Centre of Epidemiology, Surveillance and Health Promo-
tion. The second report on post-marketing surveillance of
vaccines in Italy described the side effects in a cohort of
12,990 female subject aged 9–16 years who received free
immunization through the Local Health System Institutions
in the period going from June 2009 to December 2011. The
main complaints observed were local reactions and symp-
toms like headache, muscles and joint pains. However, this
surveillance was limited to symptoms arising within
15 days after the vaccination. Moreover, this analysis
included only girls who voluntarily accepted to participate
to the study, moreover, it was not possible to ascertain the
effective surveillance coverage in each recruited vaccina-
tion centre [57]. It might be reasonable comparing girls
receiving and refusing freely available HPV vaccination,
planning a longer follow-up period and collecting data by
telephone interviews taking advantage of specific ques-
tionnaires for self-reported symptoms. This approach will
assess the actual burden of long-lasting AEFI and might
identify a specific population to be investigated in order to
detect genetic traits and/or prognostic biological markers,
predicting an increased risk for long-lasting AEFI. Cur-
rently,
few
studies
describing
a
positive
correlation
between post-vaccination phenomena and genetic variants,
such HLA haplotypes or single nucleotide polymorphisms,
are currently available and have been mainly addressed to
transient symptoms, such as fever, arthralgia and other
systemic ADRs [19, 58]. Recently, an increased risk of
narcolepsy, which could be included in the spectrum of
ASIA, was described after AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 vacci-
nation and, importantly, the authors proposed an associa-
tion with HLA-DQB1*06:02 [59, 60]. Thus, the possibility
to find similar genetic or biological markers might increase
the safety of immunization programs and decrease the
existence of vaccine refusal movements.
Conclusively, our study highlighted some important
post-vaccination phenomena temporally linked to HPV
immunization, which needs further epidemiological anal-
ysis and biological investigations in order to establish or
exclude a causal relation.
The exact incidence of these post-vaccination syndromes
in the general population has not been known yet and a
definite cause/effect link between HPV vaccine-related
immune activation and symptoms onset has to be estab-
lished. However, the studies on fibromyalgia, chronic pain
with dysautonomia and CFS considered that a previous
subclinical and spontaneous reaction to viral agents could be
often involved in the start of pain and functional impairment.
Therefore, a link between HPV vaccination and some neu-
romuscular and systemic impairment might be possible,
considering also the immunization properties displayed by
HPV vaccines, according to several studies [61].
Moreover, the HPV vaccine formula, containing also
high polysorbate 80 (50 mcg) concentration, might also
induce a greater meningeal permeability leading to a
114
Environment and Autoimmunity (2017) 65:106–116
123
 facilitated entrance of many substances to the central ner-
vous system. Based upon these observations, it might be
speculated that this vaccine—and not others—could induce
some abnormal activation of immune competent cells in
the central nervous system, such as the glia [62, 63].
Finally, we believe that our commitment should be plan-
ning epidemiological and genetic investigations in order to
clarify the existence and pathophysiology of HPV-related
syndromes. Hopefully, this approach might lead to a screen
test for this risk and, eventually, to prevent it: indeed, these
syndromes are currently an orphan drug area, as all the
experimented therapies have not shown any significant
beneficial effect. Last but not least, a proper treatment for
these somatoform syndromes is urgently needed, as the
current painkilling drugs, including opiates, resulted to be
ineffective, or paradoxically, pain enhancers.
