ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and a leading cause 
of cancer-related mortality. Observed during CRC tumorigenesis is loss of post-
transcriptional regulation of tumor-promoting genes such as COX-2, TNFα and 
VEGF. Overexpression of the RNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1) occurs during 
colon tumorigenesis and is abnormally present within the cytoplasm, where it post-
transcriptionally regulates genes through its interaction with 3'UTR AU-rich elements 
(AREs). Here, we examine the therapeutic potential of targeting HuR using MS-444, a 
small molecule HuR inhibitor. Treatment of CRC cells with MS-444 resulted in growth 
inhibition and increased apoptotic gene expression, while similar treatment doses 
in non-transformed intestinal cells had no appreciable effects. Mechanistically, MS-
444 disrupted HuR cytoplasmic trafficking and released ARE-mRNAs for localization 
to P-bodies, but did not affect total HuR expression levels. This resulted in MS-444-
mediated inhibition of COX-2 and other ARE-mRNA expression levels. Importantly, MS-
444 was well tolerated and inhibited xenograft CRC tumor growth through enhanced 
apoptosis and decreased angiogenesis upon intraperitoneal administration. In vivo 
treatment of MS-444 inhibited HuR cytoplasmic localization and decreased COX-2 
expression in tumors. These findings provide evidence that therapeutic strategies to 
target HuR in CRC warrant further investigation in an effort to move this approach 
to the clinic.
INTRODUCTION
The lifetime risk of developing colorectal (CRC) 
cancer is ~5% for both men and women in the USA [1]. 
Various genetic alterations have been identified that promote 
the initiation and progression of colon tumorigenesis. 
Facilitating this process is the dysregulation of gene 
regulatory mechanisms that can modulate cell growth and 
inflammation. For instance, in normal intestinal epithelium, 
levels of pro-oncogenic factors are controlled through 3'-
UTR AU-rich elements (AREs) that target mRNAs for 
rapid turnover, a process known as ARE-mediated mRNA 
decay [2]. However, this mechanism of gene regulation 
is compromised during colorectal tumorigenesis, thereby 
allowing for selective overexpression of tumor promoting 
factors such as COX-2 [3–6].

A key factor that mediates ARE-mRNA stability 
is HuR (ELAVL1), which is a member of a family of 
proteins analogous to the Drosophila embryonic-lethal 
abnormal vision (ELAV) proteins [7]. HuR has been 
previously shown to bind to its targets via ARE motifs 
and promote increased mRNA stability [8–10]. In normal 
intestinal epithelium, HuR is localized predominantly 
in the nucleus (>90%) and can shuttle between the 
nucleus and cytoplasm [4, 8, 11, 12]. However, HuR 
overexpression and cytoplasmic localization is observed 
in 76% of colorectal adenomas and 94% of colorectal 
adenocarcinomas [12], allowing for aberrant stabilization 
of ARE-containing oncogenic mRNAs.
Previous work has identified HuR as a central protein 
in the process of tumorigenesis. HuR has been shown to 
increase cell division by enhancing the stability of several 
mRNAs that regulate growth and proliferation, such as 
cyclin A, cyclin B1 and c-fos [13, 14]. Additionally, HuR 
regulates key carcinogenic processes via its stabilization 
of the pro-inflammatory and angiogenic factors such as 
TNF-α, COX-2, and VEGF, among others [4, 10, 12, 15, 
16]. Through its pleiotropic effects on tumor-promoting 
gene expression, CRC tumor-derived HuR can be viewed 
as a central node in promoting pathogenic gene expression 
necessary for the various hallmarks of cancer [7, 17].
In light of its central role in tumorigenesis and its 
differential expression between normal and cancerous 
tissues, HuR has emerged as an attractive therapeutic 
target for cancer [18–20]. Efforts to identify novel HuR 
inhibitors have led to the discovery of small molecule 
compounds derived from microbial and plant extracts, 
among them MS-444 [21]. Interestingly, MS-444 
was shown to interfere with HuR binding to its target 
mRNAs and influence HuR cytoplasmic localization. 
Such properties resulted in growth inhibition and loss of 
cytokine expression in inflammatory cell models [21].
In this report, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic HuR 
localization sensitizes colon cancer cells to the growth-
inhibitory effects of MS-444, while non-transformed 
intestinal epithelial cells are refractory to these effects. 
Additionally, we demonstrate that HuR inhibition by MS-
444 results in inhibition of COX-2 expression both in vitro 
and in vivo. Importantly, MS-444 efficiently inhibited 
CRC tumor growth in pre-clinical models, thereby 
underscoring HuR inhibition as a viable and cancer cell-
specific therapeutic strategy.
RESULTS
MS-444 inhibits the growth of CRC cells
A high-throughput based biochemical screen had 
previously identified the chrysanthone-like compound 
MS-444 (Figure 1A) as a specific inhibitor of HuR binding 
of ARE-RNAs [21]. MS-444 is produced by gram-positive 
bacteria Micromonospora and originally characterized 
as myosin light chain (MLC) kinase inhibitor [22, 23]. 
Molecular docking between the conserved tandem RNA 
recognition motif (RRM) domains 1 and 2 that are 
responsible for ARE-binding activity [24–28] and MS-444 
predicted a binding energy of -4.6 kcal/mol with hydrogen 
bonding within the RRM2 domain at residues Ser146 and 
Met117 with bond lengths of 2.7 Å and 2.5 Å, respectively 
(Figure 1A). This possible binding mode is consistent with 
previous data showing that MS-444 inhibits an RRM1-2 
truncation mutant of HuR [21].
To determine the effects of inhibiting HuR by 
MS-444, CRC cells that display HuR overexpression 
(HCT116, HCA-7, RKO, HT-29, and SW480) [3, 4, 12, 
29, 30] were treated with various concentrations (1–100 
μM) of MS-444 for 48 hr. Growth inhibition was observed 
in all CRC lines with IC50 values ranging from 5.60 μM 
to 14.21 μM with observable effects seen at 10 μM MS-
444 (Figure 1B-1C). Contrasting effects were observed 
using non-transformed small intestinal (RIE-1) and 
colonic (YAMC) epithelial cells [31]. Both cell types 
display properties of normal intestinal epithelial cells (e.g. 
polarized growth, formation of tight adherens junctions, 
and contact-mediated growth inhibition) and are proficient 
in ARE-mRNA decay [32–34]. Both non-transformed 
cell lines were ~3- to 4-fold less responsive to MS-444-
mediated growth inhibition, with IC50 values of 40.70 
μM and 28.16 μM (P < 0.05) (Figure 1B). Additionally, 
examination of nuclear morphology by Hoechst staining 
showed MS-444-treated CRC cells displayed apoptotic 
features, such as fragmented and condensed chromatin, 
while RIE-1 nuclei remained intact in the presence of MS-
444 (Figure 1C).
Previous 
studies 
have 
demonstrated 
HuR 
overexpression to be anti-apoptotic through its influence 
on the expression of multiple pro-survival mRNAs 
[35, 36]. To determine if HuR inhibition by MS-444 
promoted apoptosis, HCT116 colon cancer cells and 
non-transformed RIE-1 cells were treated with 10 μM 
MS-444 for 48 hr and assayed by flow cytometry for 
annexin V detection using propidium iodide to identify 
and exclude late apoptotic and necrotic cells. Treatment 
of cells with cycloheximide and TNF-α served as a 
positive control. While MS-444 treatment triggered a 
strong (>5-fold) apoptotic response in HCT116 cells, RIE-
1 cells were refractory to this effect at identical MS-444 
concentrations (Figure 2A-2B). Similar to these results, 
MS-444 treatment promoted caspase 3 activation in CRC 
cells HCT116 and HCA-7 with no detectable levels of 
caspase 3 cleavage observed in RIE-1 cells (Figure 2C). 
A significant increase in pro-apoptotic gene expression 
was observed in MS-444-treated SW480 and HCT116 
CRC cells (Figure 2D and data not shown, respectively). 
Previous studies have demonstrated that siRNA-mediated 
knockdown of HuR can promote apoptosis [35, 36]. 
Consistent with this, siRNA knockdown of HuR in 
HCT116 cells resulted in apoptosis. However, apoptosis

induction by HuR knockdown was less robust (15.5%) 
when compared to 10 μM MS-444 treatment (41.3%) 
(Supplementary Figure S1A-S1B, Figure 1A-1B). 
Together, these results demonstrate the ability of MS-444 
to promote apoptosis selectively in CRC cancer cells and 
not in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells within 
the low micromolar concentration range, thus providing a 
potential therapeutic window.
Cytoplasmic localization of HuR sensitizes 
cells to MS-444
Rapid ARE-mRNA decay occurs primarily in the 
cytoplasm, however the presence of cytoplasmic HuR 
in CRC cells impedes this process [3, 4, 6, 12, 37, 38]. 
To test the effects of MS-444 on HuR behavior in CRC 
cells, immunofluorescence and western blot analyses of 
HuR expression revealed that 10 μM MS-444 induced 
nuclear HuR localization in HCT116 cells with loss of 
cytoplasmic HuR occurring after 1 hr of treatment (Figure 
3A-3B). This rapid change in localization was not due to 
HuR loss since treatment with 10 and 50 μM MS-444 up 
to 24 hr showed no differences in level of HuR expression 
in whole cell lysates (Figure 3B, Supplementary Figure 
S3A) and HuR cleavage products were not observed (data 
not shown). The effects of MS-444 also were specific to 
HuR since subcellular localization of endogenous (p38 
MAPK, Erk1/2, and Akt) proteins were not impacted 
(Supplementary Figure S2). Furthermore, MS-444 
was not observed to impact myosin light chain (MLC) 
kinase levels [22, 23] or MAPK signaling up to 100 μM 
(Supplementary Figure S3B-S3C).
We have previously demonstrated the ability 
of oncogenic Ras to influence HuR-mediated post-
transcriptional regulation of COX-2 and ARE-containing 
mRNAs during intestinal cell transformation [32–33]. In 
this context, we sought to assess the specificity of MS-
444 on oncogenic Ras-transformed cells and its effect on 
HuR localization. We examined the effects of MS-444 on 
non-transformed cells and isogenic variants (RIE-iRAS) 
that are transformed by oncogenic Ras. RIE-iRas cells 
are RIE-1 containing an IPTG-inducible cDNA of RasV12, 
and when cultured in the presence of IPTG for 24 hr to 
induce oncogenic Ras, undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) [33, 34]. Shown in Figure 3C, 
immunofluorescence analysis of RIE-iRas cells expressing 
oncogenic Ras showed cytoplasmic localization of HuR, 
whereas in non-transformed cells HuR is predominantly 
nuclear. RIE-iRas cells were then cultured in the presence 
and absence of IPTG for 24 hr, after which 10 μM MS-
444 was added. After 8 hr of MS-444 treatment, HuR 
localization to the nucleus was detected (Figure 3C). To 
determine if Ras-transformed cells exhibited a higher 
sensitivity to MS-444, growth assays were performed. 
RIE-iRas expressing oncogenic Ras exhibited >13-fold 
increased sensitivity to MS-444 with an IC50 of 2.33 μM, 
as compared to 31.93 μM in non-transformed cells (Figure 
3D). Similar results were obtained using conditionally 
immortalized YAMC colonocytes and Ras-transformed 
YAMC cells expressing the v-Ha-Ras oncogene [39] 
(YAMC-Ras, Figure 3E-3F), further indicating that MS-
444 sensitivity correlates with cytoplasmic HuR.
MS-444 regulates COX-2 expression in 
CRC cells
Our prior work has shown HuR to be a key 
contributor to COX-2 overexpression in CRC through 
ARE-mediated mRNA stabilization [3, 6, 12]. To test 
whether HuR inhibition by MS-444 affected endogenous 
COX-2 levels, HCA-7 cells were treated with 12 μM MS-
444 over a 24 hr time-course that revealed a loss of COX-
2 mRNA occurring within 6-12 hr of treatment (Figure 
4A). HCA-7 cells were then treated with increasing 
concentrations of MS-444 for 8 hr, and COX-2 mRNA and 
protein expression was assayed. COX-2 mRNA expression 
was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner 
with an IC50 of 6.75 μM (Figure 4B), along with a similar 
dose-dependent attenuation in COX-2 protein observed 
(Figure 4C).
To establish whether the effect of MS-444 on 
COX-2 expression occurred through disruption of the 
HuR/COX-2 mRNA association, ribonucleoprotein 
immunoprecipitation (RNP-IP) was performed in 
HCA-7 cells treated with 10 μM MS-444 for 6 hr and 
immunoprecipitation of cytoplasmic lysates was done 
using an antibody against HuR. The association of COX-2 
mRNA with HuR was assayed by qPCR of COX-2 mRNA 
in immunoprecipitates. As shown in Figure 4D, COX-2 
mRNA was significantly enriched in the HuR IP samples 
in vehicle treated cells compared to RNP-IP samples 
using control IgG. In contrast, a 4-fold reduction in COX-
2 mRNA was observed in HuR immunoprecipitates from 
MS-444 treated cells. To determine if the effects on COX-
2 occurred via the ARE-containing COX-2 3'UTR [10], 
HCT116 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter 
containing the COX-2 3’UTR and treated with 10 μM MS-
444 for 8 hr (Figure 4E), MS-444 promoted approximately 
2-fold inhibition in luciferase expression in the presence 
of the ARE-containing 3'UTR and did not significantly 
influence expression of a control reporter (LucΔ3'UTR). 
Consistent with these observations, MS-444 did not 
impact levels of non-ARE-containing mRNAs COX-1 and 
β-actin (Supplementary Figure S4A), further supporting 
that MS-444 regulates COX-2 expression via the 3’UTR.
In non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells, COX-
2 and ARE-mRNAs are degraded in discrete cytoplasmic 
RNA granules known as processing bodies (P-bodies) 
[31]. To determine the effects of MS-444 upon P-body 
formation and mRNA localization to P-bodies, we 
utilized the MS2 dual plasmid system for fluorescent RNA 
visualization [31, 40]. HCT116 cells were transfected

with the reporter construct pMS2-COX-2 3'UTR, which 
expressed a chimeric RNA consisting of 12 tandem MS2 
RNA hairpins and the COX-2 3'UTR (Figure 4F). Cells 
were co-transfected with pMS2-YFP, which expresses 
YFP-tagged MS2-binding protein that contains a nuclear 
localization signal (NLS), allowing for visualization of the 
chimeric MS2-COX-2 3'UTR RNA (as the complex MS2-
YFP/MS2-COX-2 3'UTR). P-bodies were visualized by 
co-transfecting the mCherry-tagged P-body marker Dcp1a 
[31]. As shown in Figure 4F (right panels), treatment with 
MS-444 for 8 hr did not impact P-body numbers or size, 
with approximately 6 P-bodies per cell detected in both 
control and MS-444-treated cells (Supplementary Figure 
S4B). Due to the presence of the NLS in the MS2-YFP 
protein, the majority of MS2-YFP signal appeared nuclear 
in both conditions (Figure 4F). In control-treated cells, 
MS2-COX-2 3'UTR RNA observed in the cytoplasm 
showed limited trafficking to P-bodies with co-localization 
occurring only in 23% of P-bodies. By contrast, treatment 
with MS-444 enhanced co-localization of MS2-COX-2 
3'UTR RNA to Dcp1a signal, with approximately 70% 
of the total number of P-bodies per cell showing co-
localization with the COX-2 3’UTR reporter (Figure 
4F-4G). Control experiments using MS2 RNA lacking 
a 3'UTR (MS2-Δ3'UTR) showed no reporter RNA co-
localization with Dcp1a in the presence or absence of MS-
444 (data not shown). These findings indicate that MS-
444 promotes COX-2 mRNA decay by allowing mRNA 
trafficking to P-bodies.
MS-444 inhibition of CRC tumor growth in vivo
Prior examination of MS-444 acute toxicity in rats 
showed no lethality at concentrations of 100 mg/kg by 
intraperitoneal (IP) administration [41]. To determine 
a tolerable dose range for mice, a dose escalation study 
over 24 hr period was performed by IP, oral (PO), 
and intravenous (IV) administration. For IP and PO 
administration, no signs of acute toxicity were observed 
up to 100 mg/kg. IV administration was well tolerated up 
to 25 mg/kg, with some signs of toxicity (hunched posture 
and tremors) observed at 50 mg/kg.
To test the effects of MS-444 on CRC cell growth 
in vivo, mice bearing HCT116 cell xenografts received 
IP injections of MS-444 (25 mg/kg bw) or vehicle every 
48 hr. Over the experiment course, mice did not display 
any adverse effects and maintained similar weights 
(Supplementary Figure S5A). Anti-tumor effects of 
MS-444 were observed with approximately 1.7-fold 
reduction in tumor size (Figure 5A). The effects of MS-
444 to inhibit cytoplasmic HuR localization were also 
observed in treated tumors (Figure 5B). To determine 
if MS-444 treatment attenuated tumor growth through 
enhanced apoptosis, sections were stained for caspase 3 
cleavage. Shown in Figure 5C, MS-444 treated tumors 
exhibited a higher amount of cleaved caspase 3-positive 
cells with significantly heightened apoptotic index. Based 
on cytoplasmic HuR localization supporting enhanced 
angiogenic gene expression and tumor angiogenesis 
[42, 43], we evaluated the impact of MS-444 on tumor 
microvessel density (MVD). HCT116 tumor sections 
were immunostained with anti-CD31 antibody to visualize 
blood vessels and MVD was determined by counting the 
number of blood vessels per field imaged. Mice treated 
with MS-444 showed a marked 2- to 3-fold decrease in 
MVD (Figure 5D), indicating the anti-angiogenic potential 
of MS-444.
MS-444 attenuates tumor COX-2 expression
Based on results shown above, the ability of MS-
444 to alter COX-2 expression in vivo was determined 
using HCA-7 cell xenografts that display elevated COX-
2 levels and COX-2 dependent tumor growth [12, 44, 
45]. Using dosing as described with HCT116 tumors, 
IP administration of MS-444 was more effective at 
inhibiting HCA-7 tumor growth without any observable 
adverse effects (Figure 6A, Supplementary Figure S5B). 
Consistent with the ability of MS-444 to inhibit COX-2 
expression in HCA-7 cells (Figure 4), IHC analysis of 
COX-2 protein levels in HCA-7 xenograft tumors was 
attenuated by MS-444 (Figure 6B).
Our in vivo observations indicate that MS-444 
impacts the growth of established tumors >100 mm3 
(Figure 5A, Figure 6A). To further characterize this 
and evaluate alternative MS-444 dosing schedules, 
HCA-7 cell xenografts were allowed to form palpable 
tumors (approximately 100 mm3) and then treated 
intraperitoneally with MS-444 (25 mg/kg bw) every 72 hr 
for 15 days followed by a 7-day period during which they 
received daily injections of the same dose (Figure 6C). 
Under this dosing schedule, no significant change in tumor 
volume was observed until daily dosing at day 14 (Figure 
6C). Assessment of COX-2 expression was determined 
by IP injection of the fluorescently-labeled COX-2 probe 
(Fluorocoxib) [46] on day 21. Ex vivo Image analysis of 
the freshly excised tumors revealed a significant decrease 
in COX-2 protein expression (Figure 6D). COX-2 mRNA 
analysis determined by qPCR corroborated these findings 
(Figure 6E), indicating that selective small molecule-based 
inhibition of HuR functionally impacts tumor COX-2 
levels and alters tumor growth potential.
DISCUSSION
Although somatic mutations have been closely 
linked to the progression model of CRC tumorigenesis 
[47]. CRC tumors have a disproportionate level of 
tumor promoting genes expressed that contain AREs 
within their 3'UTRs [33], and many of these mRNA 
transcripts have been shown to be bound and regulated 
by the RNA binding protein HuR [19]. Previous work in

our lab demonstrated that cytoplasmic HuR localization 
is observed in 76% of colorectal adenomas and 94% of 
colorectal adenocarcinomas [12]. Moreover, increased 
HuR expression and cytoplasmic localization in tumors 
correlate with poor disease prognosis and advanced tumor 
staging [12, 48–51]. Thus, there are many data points from 
multiple laboratories over various tumor types that HuR is 
a strong candidate target in cancer [7, 18, 19, 52]. In this 
study, MS444 is used here as a tool compound for proof-
of-principle for pharmacological HuR inhibition, and that 
targeting HuR with MS-444 has anti-tumor activity as a 
monotherapy in multiple pre-clinical models for CRC.
Logically, the therapeutic strategies to inhibit HuR, 
especially in CRC, would be to: 1) silence expression 
levels [53], 2) disrupt the ARE-binding activity which is 
mediated through the conserved RNA recognition motifs 
(RRM) domains of HuR, and 3) inhibit HuR nuclear to 
cytoplasmic translocation. In this study, we explored MS-
444, originally identified as a HuR inhibitor in a confocal 
high-throughput screen of microbial, mycological, and 
plant extracts [21], wherein MS-444 was successful in 
disrupting binding between HuR and its ARE-containing 
mRNA targets. Structurally, HuR consists of two-
tandem RRM domains, followed by a hinge region and

a third RRM domain. The ARE-binding activity of HuR 
is mediated through the conserved RRM1/2 domains 
[24–27]. RRM1/2 may also provide an interface for HuR 
homodimerization, with each HuR monomer contacting 
a single ARE [21, 54]. Thus mechanistically, it was 
established that MS-444 binds HuR within its first two 
tandem RRM motifs and prevents HuR homodimerization, 
preventing HuR from trafficking to the cytoplasm, where 
it is known to exert its mRNA-stabilizing function [21].
Based on HuR's ability to support an anti-apoptotic 
network through post-transcriptional mechanisms [7, 
35], we performed a focused qPCR array of apoptosis-
related genes in MS-444-treated CRC cells. Expression 
profiling revealed an increased expression of many pro-
apoptotic markers as a result of MS-444 treatment. Our 
data demonstrate that the expression of Fas ligand, a 
TNF superfamily member, is significantly increased, 
accompanied by elevated expression of caspase 8 and cell 
death effectors such as Bax and Bid. Additionally, the TNF 
receptor superfamily member 10A (TNFSF10A, Death 
receptor 4) was significantly upregulated, suggesting 
MS-444 triggers an apoptotic response mediated by 
TNF superfamily members and death receptor 4 (Figure 
2D). Importantly, DR4 has recently been validated as a 
HuR target in another tumor system [55]. These results, 
along with previous findings in the field, suggest that 
inhibition of HuR (via MS-444 treatment) triggers a 
Fas-dependent signaling cascade mediated through 
cellular caspases, thereby resulting in cell death. An 
important remaining question is whether MS-444’s pro-
apoptotic effect is directly due to the disruption of HuR 
target gene regulation. For example, previous studies 
have demonstrated that HuR mediates an anti-apoptotic 
response by repressing the expression of death receptor 5 
(DR5), and now more recently DR4 [36, 55]. Consistent 
with these findings, siRNA-mediated knockdown and 
MS-444 inhibition of HuR resulted in elevated DR5/
DR4 expression levels, thus promoting apoptosis (Figure 
2, Supplementary Figure S1) [35, 36, 55], presumably 
by making the receptor more available for targeting and 
signaling. Interestingly, apoptosis induction by HuR 
knockdown was less robust when compared to MS-
444 treatment. Prior work has demonstrated that during 
caspase-mediated apoptosis, HuR is cleaved to generate 
two cleavage products that switch its function from 
being a pro-survival factor to a promoter of apoptosis 
in response to lethal stress [56–58]. Of note, we did not 
detect the induction of HuR caspase-dependent cleavage 
when cells are treated with MS-444 (unpublished data 
D.A.D and J.R.B), indicating that MS-444 selectively 
targets HuR and does not influence other pathways known 
to promote HuR cleavage.
Studies have demonstrated that inhibition of HuR 
can enhance therapeutic efficacy of certain therapeutic 
strategies by inhibiting stressors (e.g., hypoxia, glucose 
deprivation, chemotherapies) that induce HuR cytoplasmic 
localization in pancreatic cancer cells [18, 59–61]. Our 
findings showing the ability of MS-444 to attenuate CRC 
tumor growth in vivo through enhanced apoptosis and 
decreased angiogenesis, implicate that selective targeting 
of these pathways in combination with MS-444 may 
improve the limited inhibition on tumor growth by MS-
444 as a monotherapy. Further efforts to evaluate these 
findings in CRC models as a means to identify clinically 
available targeted and cytotoxic therapies that would 
synergize with HuR targeted therapy are in progress. 
These efforts, along with other modes of HuR inhibition 
(i.e., targeted siRNA delivery [53]), being evaluated in 
pre-clinical models for: 1) targeting specificity, 2) toxicity 
profiles, and 3) therapeutic effects against malignant 
phenotypes, will further support the notion that HuR is 
a valuable target in CRC and that pharmacological HuR 
inhibitors such as MS-444 warrant further investigation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, reagents and molecular docking
Human colorectal cancer cells SW480, HT-29, 
HCT116, and RKO were obtained from the American 
Type Culture Collection (ATCC); HCA7 cells were 
provided by S. Kirkland (Imperial College, London, 
United Kingdom). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's 
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone). Intestinal epithelial 
cells lines RIE-1, RIE-iRas, YAMC, and YAMC-Ras were 
provided by R. D. Beauchamp (Vanderbilt University 
Medical Center, Nashville, TN). RIE-iRas cells were 
cultured as described [34] using 5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce the expression 
of oncogenic RasV12 cDNA. Conditionally immortalized 
colonocytes YAMC and YAMC-Ras (YAMC cells 
overexpressing the v-Ha-Ras oncogene) cells were 
maintained under permissive conditions as described [39] 
at 33°C in RPMI-1640 media containing 25 mM HEPES 
and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen) and supplemented 
with 5% FBS, insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS) 
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 U/ml of murine IFN-γ (Roche). 
Experiments were performed with cells at non-permissive 
conditions at 37°C without IFN-γ in the growth medium. 
MS-444 was obtained from Novartis Institutes for 
Biomedical Research (Basel, Switzerland) and solubilized 
in DMSO using an extinction coefficient of 2,200 M-1cm-1 
at 328 nm.
Molecular docking was performed using the X-ray 
crystal structure of two methylated tandem RRM domains 
(RRM1/2) of HuR in their RNA-free form (PDB ID: 
4EGL) [28]. MS-444 ligand was energy minimized and 
partial charges were added using PRODRG algorithms 
[62] and docked using Auto-Dock Vina software [63]. The 
Auto-Dock Tools graphical user interface [64] was used 
to add polar hydrogens and partial charges to 4EGL using

Kollman United charges. Atomic solvation parameters 
and fragment volumes were assigned using the ADDSOL 
subroutine. The grid map was calculated using the 
auxiliary program Autogrid3. Grid maps of 120x120x120 
points centered on the active site of the ligand with 
0.375 A° spacing were calculated for each atom types 
found on the adducts. Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm 
(LGA) was selected for ligand conformational search. 
The Genetic Algorithm (GA) population size was set to 
150, the maximum number of GA energy evaluations as 
2500000, GA mutation rate as 0.02, GA crossover rate as 
0.8 and GA docking runs was set as 100. The resulting 
docking conformations were clustered into families of 
similar conformation, with root mean square deviation 
(RMSD) clustering tolerance as 1.0 A°. As a rule, the 
lowest docking energy conformations were included in the 
largest cluster. Flexible torsion in the ligands was assigned 
with AUTOTORS, an auxiliary module for Auto-Dock 
Tools. The ligand was docked to obtain the best binding 
conformation.
MS-444 sensitivity assay
Cells were seeded at subconfluent levels (<50% 
confluence) in 96-well tissue culture plates and treated 
with increasing concentrations of MS-444 [21] for 48 
hours at 37°C. Cell survival was assayed using the MTT-
based cell growth determination kit (Sigma-Aldrich) 
as previously described [3]. Relative cell survival was 
calculated as percentage relative to DMSO vehicle-treated 
controls. A dose-response curve was fitted to the data using 
the software KaleidaGraph 4.0 (Synergy), from which the 
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was derived 
and represented as a mean of 4 independent experiments 
± standard error of the mean (SEM).
Annexin V staining and flow cytometry
HCT116 and RIE-1 cells treated with 10 μM MS-
444 for 48 hours were subjected to Annexin V staining and 
flow cytometry per manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher-
Molecular Probes). 1x106 cells were resuspended in Annexin 
V binding buffer and incubated with 5 μL Annexin V-PE and 
5 μL propidium iodide for 15 minutes in the dark. Cells were 
subjected to flow cytometry using the BD Accuri C6 flow 
cytometer. The collected data was subjected to compensation 
analysis by adjusting the gating and virtual voltage in the BD 
Accuri C6 software and graphically represented as means 
of 3 independent experiments. Cells treated with 5 μg/ml 
cycloheximide (Chx) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 ng/ml TNF-α 
(R&D Systems) for 8 hr were used as positive controls.
Western blotting
Western blots were performed as described [12] 
using antibodies against HuR (clone 3A2, Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:20,000 for 1 hr at RT 
and COX-2 (160126, Cayman Chemical) at a dilution 
of 1:1000 for 16 hours at 4°C. Caspase 3 cleavage was 
detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-Caspase 3 (9662, 
Cell Signaling) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 16 hr at 4°C. 
Membranes were stripped and re-probed using β-actin 
antibody (Clone C4; MP Biomedicals). Cytoplasmic 
lysates were obtained using NE-PER cytoplasmic 
extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific) using α-tubulin 
(322500, 1:20,000 dilution, Invitrogen) and Lamin 
A/C (2032S, 1:2,000 dilution, Cell Signaling) as 
cytoplasmic and nuclear loading controls, respectively. 
Detection and quantitation of blots were carried out as 
described [10].
RNA analysis
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent 
(Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 μg 
of total RNA in combination with oligo(dT) and Improm-
II reverse transcriptase (Promega). qPCR analysis was 
performed as described [12] using the 7300 PCR Assay 
System with TaqMan probes for COX-2 (PTGS2) and 
GAPDH (Applied Biosystems). GAPDH was used as 
a control for normalization. Detection of apoptosis-
associated mRNAs was accomplished using Apoptosis 
PCR Array PAHS-012Z (SA Biosciences/Qiagen) and 
qPCR was performed according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol using SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied 
Biosystems). Fold change in mRNA expression levels was 
normalized to the cycle threshold (Ct) using non-treated 
cells and analyzed by the ΔΔCt method.
Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitations
Immunoprecipitation (IP) of ribonucleoprotein 
complexes (RNP-IP) was done as described [6] using 
HCA-7 cells grown on 100 mm dishes treated with 
either vehicle DMSO or 10 μM MS-444 for 6 hr. Prior 
to harvesting cells, 40 μl of Protein A/G beads (sc-
2003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were coated with 20 
μg of rabbit anti-HuR (3A2, Cat # sc-5261, Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology) or control IgG antibody overnight at 
4°C. Beads were washed in NT2 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl 
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NP-40) and 
incubated with equal amounts (250 μg) of cytoplasmic 
lysates obtained from cells lysed in 200 μl polysome 
lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 
mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% NP-40) containing 100 
U/ml RNase inhibitor (Ambion) and protease inhibitor 
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated overnight at 
4°C with HuR- or control-IgG coated beads. Reactions 
were washed 5X with NT2 buffer and total RNA was 
isolated from immunoprecipitates using 1 mL TRIzol 
per IP reaction and then used for cDNA synthesis. 
Analysis of COX-2 (PTGS2) mRNA was done by qPCR 
as described above.

DNA transfections
Luciferase reporter constructs containing the COX-
2 3’UTR (Luc+COX-2 3'UTR) or control (LucΔ3'UTR) 
were transfected as previously described [31]. Cells were 
transfected for 24 hr, then treated with MS-444 for 8 hr 
before being lysed in reporter lysis buffer and assayed 
using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, 
WI). Reporter gene activities were normalized to total 
protein; all results represent the average of triplicate 
experiments.
The MS2-based plasmids pcDNA-MS2-YFP and 
pMS2-COX-2 3'UTR used for fluorescent visualization 
of RNA, and the P-body marker mCherry-tagged Dcp1a 
(pmCherry-Dcp1a) have been previously described [31, 
40]. The MS2 plasmids were transiently co-transfected 
with pmCherry-Dcp1a into HCT116 cells using 
Lipofectamine Plus for 24 hr and the cells were treated 
with 10 μM MS-444 for 8 hr. Cells were harvested in 
2% paraformaldehyde and prepared for fluorescence 
microscopy.
Immunofluorescence
Cells grown on coverslips were washed twice 
with PBS containing 10 mM glycine, fixed in 2% 
paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT, and permeabilized 
with 0.02% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. 
Cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS 
containing 1% IgG-free BSA (Jackson Immunoresearch) 
and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C 
diluted in blocking solution. HuR was detected with 
anti-HuR monoclonal primary antibody (3A2, 1:200 
dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hr at RT. 
Secondary antibody incubation was done for 1 hr at 
RT using FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100 
dilution) or Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:500 
dilution; Invitrogen). Cells were counter-stained with 
DAPI to visualize nuclei. Fluorescence microscopy 
and image analysis was accomplished as described [31, 
61]. Detection of P-bodies and assessment of P-body 
co-localization with MS2-YFP was accomplished as 
described [31].
Xenograft tumor growth
Athymic nude (Nu/Nu) mice were purchased 
from Harlan Laboratories and maintained under sterile 
conditions in cage micro-isolators according to approved 
IACUC guidelines. HCT116 (2 x 106 cells) and HCA-7 
(2.5 x 106) cells resuspended in PBS were injected into 
the dorsal subcutaneous tissue. Mice (n=5 per group) 
received intraperitoneal (IP) injections of MS-444 (25 mg/
kg) dissolved in PBS/5% N-Methyl Pyrrolidine (NMP) 
(Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle control every 48 hr. Tumor 
growth was assayed as described [3].
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
IHC was performed using formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors sectioned at 4 μm 
with monoclonal anti-HuR antibody (19F12; Molecular 
Probes) at 1:1250, polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase 3 
(Asp175) antibody (#9661, Cell Signaling Technologies) 
at 1:1000, and polyclonal anti-COX-2 (160126; 
Cayman Chemical) at 1:400 dilutions. Staining and 
immunoreactivity scoring was performed as described 
previously [12, 65].
Microvessel density analysis
Tumor microvessels were detected by IHC ofFFPE 
tumors using a polyclonal antibody to CD31 (ab28364; 
Abcam) at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 hr at RT in primary 
antibody diluent (Dako). After washing in Tris-buffered 
saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T), slides were 
incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit labeled polymer 
(Dako). IHC was visualized using DAB peroxidase 
substrate kit (Dako) and counterstained with hematoxylin 
(Sigma-Aldrich). The area of tumor microvessels was 
quantitatively measured using the ImagePro Plus 4.5 
software (Media Cybernetics) as previously described 
[66]. Tumor section images were imported into the 
ImagePro Plus software, where the CD31-positive staining 
was selected using the color selection function. Positive 
staining pixels were measured using the area/density 
(intensity) measurement function and represented as 
microvessel density.
Ex Vivo imaging of COX-2
Athymic nude (Nu/Nu) mice bearing HCA-7 
xenografts were established as described above. When 
palpable tumors (~100 mm3) were observed, mice were 
treated with MS-444 or vehicle control as indicated. 
COX-2 protein expression was visualized ex vivo by IP 
injection of 2 mg/kg of Fluorocoxib (Xenolght Rediject 
Fluorescent COX-2 Probe, Caliper Life Sciences) for 
3 hr. Mice were euthanized and excised tumors were 
imaged in an IVIS platform (Caliper Life Sciences) with 
the following settings: 570 excitation, 620 emission, 
F-1 Stop, epifluorescence. Following visualization, the 
tumors were snap-frozen and processed for RNA and 
protein analysis.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad 
Prism (GraphPad Software). The data are expressed as the 
mean of three independent experiments ± S.E.M. Student’s 
t-test was used to determine significant differences. 
P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant.
