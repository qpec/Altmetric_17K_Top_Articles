ABSTRACT
Background. The study objective was to investigate and synthesize available evidence
relating to the psychological health of Emergency Dispatch Centre (EDC) operatives,
and to identify key stressors experienced by EDC operatives.
Methods. Eight electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo,
PsycArticles, The Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, and Google Scholar)
were searched. All study designs were included, and no date limits were set. Studies
were included if they were published in English, and explored the psychological health
of any EDC operatives, across fire, police, and emergency medical services. Studies were
excluded if they related solely to other emergency workers, such as police officers or
paramedics. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using checklists
adapted from the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. A narrative synthesis was
conducted, using thematic analysis.
Results. A total of 16 articles were included in the review. Two overarching themes were
identified during the narrative synthesis: ‘Organisational and Operational Factors’ and
‘Interactions with Others’. Stressors identified included being exposed to traumatic
calls, lacking control over high workload, and working in under-resourced and pres-
sured environments. Lack of support from management and providing an emotionally
demanding service were additional sources of stress. Peer support and social support
from friends and family were helpful in managing work-related stress.
Discussion. EDC operatives experience stress as a result of their work, which appears to
be related to negative psychological health outcomes. Future research should explore
the long-term effects of this stress, and the potential for workplace interventions to
alleviate the negative impacts on psychological health.

INTRODUCTION
Working in a healthcare environment can be stressful; healthcare staff face a range of situa-
tional, organisational and interpersonal stressors in their roles and a significant proportion
of staff report feelings of emotional exhaustion and burnout (Tuvesson, Eklund & Wann-
Hansson, 2011; Gokcen et al., 2013; Andersson et al., 2016; Qiao et al., 2016). Additionally,
staff in emergency settings are regularly exposed to demanding and traumatic situations,
including severe injuries, aggressive individuals, and death (Lin et al., 2007; Adriaenssens,
De Gucht & Maes, 2015). Emergency medical work can be unpredictable and can be
physically, cognitively and emotionally demanding. Ambulance personnel have to make
rapid assessments of patients and situations, and these assessments carry both professional
and social responsibility. Working in stressful conditions, with repeated exposure to
challenging situations, can impact negatively on both the physical and psychological
health of ambulance personnel, and may lead to burnout amongst some individuals
(Halpern et al., 2012; Sofianopoulos, Williams & Archer, 2012; Fjeldheim et al., 2014).
Before ambulance personnel attend a scene, the incident is first reported to an Emergency
Dispatch Centre (EDC) for processing. EDC operatives do not provide any hands-on first
aid; instead, they triage the incident, which involves management of a unique set of
challenges. They cannot see what is occurring at the scene and are reliant upon the caller’s
descriptions, which may be ambiguous, to infer the patient’s needs. EDC operatives must
interrogate the caller, who may be distressed, to collect as much information as possible
and assess the call’s urgency. The operative then relays relevant information about the
patient’s condition and location to an ambulance crew, and if necessary, the operative
remains on the line to provide immediate life-saving advice.
Although they are removed from the scene of the incident, EDC operatives work in
an environment characterised by some of the same difficulties encountered by front-line
responders (e.g., paramedics, police officers or fire-fighters). For example, operatives face
the demands of rapid risk assessment, time-limited decision-making, and coping with
unexpected developments, regardless of which emergency service they are supporting
(Artman & Waern, 1999; Blandford & Wong, 2004). Additionally, EDC operatives share the
issues experienced by other call-centre operatives, such as high workload, performance
monitoring, and limited opportunity for physical movement (Norman et al., 2004; Snooks
et al., 2008; Dean & Rainnie, 2009; Taylor et al., 2013). Stressors present in non-emergency
call-centres are associated with negative physical and psychological outcomes for call-centre
staff, including reduced job satisfaction, poorer work performance and increased emotional
exhaustion (Norman et al., 2004; Farquharson et al., 2012; Rod & Ashill, 2013). Stress may
also influence staff performance; increased stress in call-centre-based nurses has been
associated with greater cognitive failures and differences in decision-making (Allan et al.,
2014), and with an increased intention to leave (Farquharson et al., 2012). Finally, EDC

 employment also involves shift-work, which has been linked to increased health risks across
a range of professions, including increased rates of cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease,
blood pressure, poorer sleep quality, burnout, depression, and anxiety (Harrington,
2001; KivimÄki et al., 2010; Wright, Bogan & Wyatt, 2013; Wisetborisut et al., 2014;
Proper et al., 2016).
To date, literature reviews have focused on the sources and consequences of occupational
stress that paramedics and other ambulance personnel experience (Sofianopoulos,
Williams & Archer, 2012; Hegg-Deloye et al., 2014; Adriaenssens, De Gucht & Maes, 2015).
In contrast, there has been no published review exploring the sources of stress that impact
on psychological health when working in an EDC. Statistics from the United Kingdom
show that of all staff groups across the National Health Service, ambulance service staff have
the highest rate of sickness absence (Health & Social Care Information Centre, 2016), and
that among emergency personnel, those working in the EDC have especially high rates of
sickness absence and turnover (South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust,
2015). It is therefore important to explore the stressors experienced by EDC operatives, as
this knowledge could inform strategies to help minimise the impact of such stressors on
the psychological health of those individuals who work in an EDC.
The objectives of this systematic review were therefore to investigate and synthesize
available evidence relating to the psychological health of EDC operatives, and to identify
key stressors that they experience. The specific review question was: what elements of
working in the EDC do operatives identify as influencing their psychological health
(e.g., reports of negative symptoms of stress, burnout, and mental health conditions, or
reports suggesting strong emotional resilience and positive coping skills)?
METHODS
This review was conducted in line with the PRISMA guidelines (see Supplemental
Information 2 for checklist) and was registered on the PROSPERO database (http:
//www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO): registration number CRD42014010806.
Search strategy and screening
Eight electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, PsycArticles,
The Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, and Google Scholar) were searched
during May 2016. The contents of the Journal of Paramedic Practice were also reviewed,
but this search did not uncover any additional relevant papers. Full search strings are
reported in Supplemental Information 3.
Titles and abstracts of articles retrieved from databases were screened for eligiblity
against the inclusion criteria (see below) to determine the population being studied,
outcome measures, and study design. Any studies not excluded during abstact review were
then sourced for full-text reading. The reference lists of any articles deemed eligible for
inclusion after full-text reading were also reviewed, screened and potentially eligible articles
retrieved. This process continued until no new articles were identified.

 Inclusion criteria for studies in the review
Inclusion criteria to determine which studies would be reviewed were developed using
the PICOS acronym (Participants, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome Measures, Study
Design) as recommended by The Centre for Research and Dissemination (2009). Only
studies published in English were included. No date restrictions were set.
Although the primary population of interest for the review was EDC operatives who
work in emergency medical settings, there was a concern that there might be insufficient
evidence exploring this under-researched group. An initial literature search conducted
when piloting search strings for the review confirmed this was likely to be the case.
Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to include studies from other emergency services, as
staff working in all these settings are likely to face similar issues, such as distressed callers,
the need to risk assess each call, and time-pressured decision-making. Additionally, in some
countries, EDC operatives are responsible for calls relating to more than one emergency
service (e.g., the USA, Sweden).
Participants: Include emergency (ambulance, fire, police) call-handlers and dispatchers
(EDC operatives) working in EDCs. Exclude other emergency responders, such as
paramedics, police officers, or fire-fighters.
Intervention: Any intervention, where applicable.
Comparator: Either another intervention, or no intervention (i.e., usual practice or
care), where applicable.
Outcome Measures: Any psychological health outcome in relation to working within an
EDC.
Study Design: Any. To include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, cross-
sectional surveys, and qualitative studies.
Data extraction
Data extraction was completed by a team of reviewers working in pairs. Each member of a
pair independently reviewed and rated their allocated papers, before agreeing final ratings.
Collation of ratings and data extraction was overseen by two co-ordinating reviewers to
ensure consistent application of assessment tools by all reviewers. Any discrepancies were
discussed and amendments agreed.
Data extracted varied according to study design, but in all cases included information
about participants and key findings. For qualitative studies, the analytic method and
key themes were summarised. For quantitative studies, primary outcome measures were
reported.
Assessment of bias
The assessment tools used were adapted from the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme
checklists (www.casp-uk), as there are qualitative and quantitative versions to enable
appraisal across different study designs. For each study, a set of key questions were
considered. If the relevant information was clearly reported, a question was scored as ‘yes’.
If there was any doubt, or information was not reported in the article, that question was
marked as ‘no’ or ‘can’t tell’. Studies were given an overall rating of ‘strong’, ‘moderate’, or
Golding et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3735
4/29
 ‘weak’, based on the number of questions scored as ‘yes’; studies had to be scored as ‘yes’
on the majority of questions to be rated as ‘strong’ overall (see Supplemental Information
for details, as the criteria differed by study design). Greater emphasis was placed upon
studies rated as ‘strong’ or ‘moderate’ overall within the findings of the review (Petticrew
& Roberts, 2006).
Data synthesis
Due to heterogeneity of included studies a narrative synthesis was undertaken, using
a qualitative approach based on thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Through
discussion between four reviewers, key findings from each study were extracted, coded,
and grouped into themes and sub-themes. The goal of thematic analysis is to develop
a set of themes that are related, but conceptually distinct, and that together illustrate
important aspects of the data being analysed. Applying thematic analysis is an iterative and
interpretative process, and the themes presented in this review were developed inductively
from the data extracted from the included studies. Evidence from both qualitative and
quantitative studies was integrated into the findings.
RESULTS
Studies included in review
A total of 2,358 articles were identified from electronic searching, of which 914 were
removed as duplicates. A review of the reference lists of articles included in the review
after full-text reading identified a further 72 articles that might potentially meet the
inclusion criteria. Therefore, a total of 1,516 abstracts were retrieved for screening. During
abstract review, 1,401 articles were excluded, leaving 115 articles to be assessed through
full-text reading. After sourcing these for full-text reading, 99 articles were excluded for
the following reasons: sample did not include EDC operatives (n = 71), findings were not
related to psychological health or stress (n = 18), documents retrieved were unpublished
articles or theses (n = 10). This resulted in 16 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. These
details are summarised in Fig. 1.
Study characteristics
Extracted data relating to key study characteristics are presented in Tables 1–4. The
search returned seven qualitative and nine quantitative studies (six cross-sectional
surveys and three cohort studies); no longitudinal studies or trials of interventions were
identified.
Studies were conducted in a range of countries; seven were from the USA (Doerner, 1987;
Jenkins, 1997; Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Pierce & Lilly, 2012; Anshel,
Umscheid & Brinthaupt, 2013; Palmer, 2014), four were from the UK (James & Wright,
1991; Wastell & Newman, 1996; Sprigg, Armitage & Hollis, 2007; Coxon et al., 2016), two
from Australia (Shakespeare-Finch, Rees & Armstrong, 2014; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch &
Armstrong, 2015), one from France (Weibel et al., 2003), one from Sweden (Forslund,
Kihlgren & Kihlgren, 2004), and one from Ireland (Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008).

one studied fire EDC operatives (Palmer, 2014), and five studied police EDC operatives
(Doerner, 1987; Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Pierce & Lilly, 2012; Anshel,
Umscheid & Brinthaupt, 2013). In one study EDC operatives handled fire and ambulance
calls (Jenkins, 1997), and in one study EDC operatives handled fire, police, and ambulance
calls (Forslund, Kihlgren & Kihlgren, 2004).
Reported sample sizes in included studies ranged from nine (Coxon et al., 2016) to 27

year of study publication ranged from 1987 to 2016. One study was published in the
1980s (Doerner, 1987), four were published in the 1990s (James & Wright, 1991; Wastell &
Newman, 1996; Jenkins, 1997; Tracy & Tracy, 1998), five between 2000 and 2010 (Shuler
& Sypher, 2000; Weibel et al., 2003; Forslund, Kihlgren & Kihlgren, 2004; Sprigg, Armitage
& Hollis, 2007; Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008), and six after 2010 (Pierce & Lilly, 2012;
Anshel, Umscheid & Brinthaupt, 2013; Palmer, 2014; Shakespeare-Finch, Rees & Armstrong,
2014; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015; Coxon et al., 2016).
Risk of bias within studies
Details of the application of the assessment tool are shown in Tables 5 and 6. One qualitative
(Forslund, Kihlgren & Kihlgren, 2004) and five quantitative (Doerner, 1987; James & Wright,
1991; Weibel et al., 2003; Sprigg, Armitage & Hollis, 2007; Anshel, Umscheid & Brinthaupt,
2013) studies were assessed as ‘weak’, and were therefore deemed to be at higher risk of
potential bias. Four qualitative (Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Gallagher &
McGilloway, 2008; Palmer, 2014) and three quantitative studies (Wastell & Newman, 1996;

 two qualitative (Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015; Coxon et al., 2016) and one
quantitative (Pierce & Lilly, 2012) studies were assessed as ‘strong’. The narrative results
that follow are based predominantly on the findings from the ten studies judged to be
either ‘moderate’ or ‘strong’.
Participant demographics were described in most studies; however, amongst the
quantitative studies recruitment methods were not always clearly reported (Wastell &
Newman, 1996; Weibel et al., 2003; Sprigg, Armitage & Hollis, 2007), and in one study
participants were only recruited from two out of three shifts (Jenkins, 1997).
Narrative synthesis
Evidence from both qualitative and quantitative studies were synthesised into two
main themes: ‘Organisational and Operational Factors’ and ‘Interactions with Others’.
Subthemes explored factors that influenced perceived levels of stress, emotional distress
and/or wellbeing.
Theme 1: organisational and operational factors
Three subthemes were identified that related to key stressors associated with the workplace
environment.
1a: perceptions of control. EDC operatives across all emergency settings generally reported
a lack of control over their workload, and a lack of organisational recognition for the
demands of managing their workload. Multitasking and balancing competing demands
is a common feature of the role (Doerner, 1987; Palmer, 2014; Adams, Shakespeare-
Finch & Armstrong, 2015; Coxon et al., 2016), but workload planning was reported as
difficult due to unpredictability in the volume of calls (Jenkins, 1997). Operatives’ lack
of control was exacerbated by excess workloads, role conflict, being monitored, and by
a lack of understanding of their role by outsiders (Doerner, 1987; Shuler & Sypher, 2000;
Palmer, 2014; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015; Coxon et al., 2016), which also
manifested in feelings of being undervalued and demoralised.
Physical layout and constricted or inadequate workspaces added to this sense of low
control and increased stress (James & Wright, 1991; Weibel et al., 2003; Palmer, 2014; Coxon
et al., 2016). Ambulance operatives reported feeling out of control over their workload and
current activity within their area of responsibility after returning from rest breaks; this fear
of losing control meant they often chose not to take their allocated break time, even though
such breaks were allowed during the working day (Coxon et al., 2016).
A lack of control over outcomes was identified as another source of stress across
several studies. Police operatives sought to overcome feelings of powerlessness and gain
some control through advice giving and by upping call priorities; operatives sometimes
over-rode preassigned priority codes in the system to give a call an increased priority
(Tracy & Tracy, 1998). Despite this, both police and ambulance operatives still sometimes
felt powerless, as they had little control over, and knowledge about, outcomes for the
patient or caller. If a poor outcome was reported, operatives sometimes felt responsible,
especially if they felt they had been unable to influence the caller to do what was required
(Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015). Compounding this,
Golding et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3735
17/29
 operatives who had previous field experience as fire-fighters or paramedics, were further
frustrated by the lack of control they had over outcomes; in the EDC they felt there was
little they could do, compared to the more active roles they used to take in responding
to emergencies (Palmer, 2014). Feelings of powerlessness and lack of control appeared to
contribute to the stress experienced by these operatives (Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Palmer, 2014;
Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015).
More positively, in one study, self-efficacy was highlighted as being important in
helping reduce stress. Operatives who believed they were capable of coping, felt better
able to deal with stressors, and experienced greater wellbeing (Shakespeare-Finch, Rees &
Armstrong, 2014).
1b: exposure to traumatic and abusive calls. Psychological stress associated with taking
traumatic and sometimes abusive calls was explored in several studies. Despite not being
physically exposed to the emergency situation, there was some evidence that EDC operatives
experience the trauma vicariously. In one study, participants reported experiencing fear,
helplessness, or horror in reaction to 32% of the different types of calls (e.g., calls about
children, suicide or domestic violence) that they received (Pierce & Lilly, 2012). Operatives
reported higher peri-traumatic distress compared to police officers, and this level of
distress experienced during and immediately after a traumatic call positively correlated
with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and burnout (Pierce & Lilly, 2012).
PTSD symptomology was identified in police and ambulance operatives (Pierce & Lilly,
2012; Shakespeare-Finch, Rees & Armstrong, 2014; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong,
2015). Calls relating to road traffic accidents, incidents involving children or vulnerable
adults, domestic violence, and suicides were commonly cited as the most distressing types of
call (James & Wright, 1991; Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Forslund, Kihlgren
& Kihlgren, 2004; Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008; Pierce & Lilly, 2012).
Handling traumatic calls was related to lower organisational commitment, a higher desire
to leave, and greater emotional exhaustion (Sprigg, Armitage & Hollis, 2007). Exposure to
potentially traumatic calls also impacted ambulance operatives’ mental health; some
operatives reported angry outbursts, difficulties sleeping, nightmares, flashbacks, and
increases in alcohol consumption (Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008; Adams, Shakespeare-
Finch & Armstrong, 2015). Four ambulance operatives in one study reported taking long-
term sick-leave in the previous year due to job-stress (Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008).
Police operatives reported using both approach and avoidance coping strategies when
engaging with callers (Anshel, Umscheid & Brinthaupt, 2013).
In addition to traumatic calls, some studies reported instances of abusive calls. Abuse
came mostly from callers (James & Wright, 1991; Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Sprigg, Armitage &
Hollis, 2007), but sometimes from fellow professionals (Sprigg, Armitage & Hollis, 2007;
Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008). Operatives had to suppress their emotional reactions
when dealing with these callers (Tracy & Tracy, 1998). Ambulance operatives who received
more calls that were abusive were higher in emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and
anxiety; these operatives also had a higher intention to quit their job (Sprigg, Armitage &
Hollis, 2007).
Golding et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3735
18/29
 Nonetheless, not all operatives experienced difficult calls negatively; in one study, partic-
ipants reported gaining ‘emotional competence’ following repeated exposure to traumatic
calls, and they gained additional satisfaction from the altruistic nature of their supportive
role (Shuler & Sypher, 2000). Another study explored the nature of post-traumatic growth
amongst ambulance operatives; participants reported finding value and a new appreciation
of life as a result of their job role (Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015).
1c: making decisions in uncertain, under-resourced, and pressured environments. A lack of
high quality training was identified by some operatives as contributing to stress levels, and
created a negative perception of the organisation (Doerner, 1987; Gallagher & McGilloway,
2008; Palmer, 2014; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015; Coxon et al., 2016).
Poor training also resulted in lower personal responsibility for performance amongst
ambulance operatives (Coxon et al., 2016). Untrained supervisors and a high turnover
of staff created additional stress amongst fire and police operatives, due to an increased
workload (Doerner, 1987; Palmer, 2014). EDC operatives in Sweden, who deal with all
emergency services, emphasised limited resources in the healthcare system, which made
prioritising and managing calls more challenging (Forslund, Kihlgren & Kihlgren, 2004).
The process of gathering relevant and sufficient information in an EDC is a time critical
task, which in itself appears to be stressful. One study that examined the introduction of an
electronic dispatching system, found the new system improved the efficiency of information
gathering, compared to the previous paper-based system, and self-reported stress levels
were reduced as a result (Wastell & Newman, 1996). System efficiencies, however, do
not necessarily reduce stress from clinical uncertainty, resulting from distressed callers
who provide insufficient information, and report vague symptoms (James & Wright,
1991; Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Forslund, Kihlgren & Kihlgren, 2004; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch
& Armstrong, 2015). Operatives also experienced frustration with callers’ physical and
linguistic capabilities, and those who did not fully answer questions or follow instructions,
which were further barriers to their understanding of the situation (Tracy & Tracy, 1998;
Forslund, Kihlgren & Kihlgren, 2004; Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008; Adams, Shakespeare-
Finch & Armstrong, 2015).
Despite these challenges, some operatives appeared to enjoy the fast-paced and
sometimes exciting environment of the EDC (Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Palmer, 2014; Coxon et
al., 2016). The adrenaline rush and variety experienced was cited as a reason for continuing
in the role (Doerner, 1987; Shuler & Sypher, 2000). Nonetheless, the demands should not
be underestimated, as operatives described having to juggle several competing and equally
important tasks at once, and high, relentless workloads were commonly reported (James
& Wright, 1991; Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008; Palmer, 2014; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch &
Armstrong, 2015; Coxon et al., 2016). Police operatives were particularly concerned about
their performance in handling fluid situations, such as robberies-in-progress or suicidal
callers, in case they did not make the correct decisions (Tracy & Tracy, 1998).
Golding et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3735
19/29
 Theme 2: interactions with others
Three subthemes identified related to how operatives’ experiences of stress were influenced
by their interactions with other people.
2a: perceived quality of supervisory relationships. Poor leadership frustrated EDC operatives
(Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008; Palmer, 2014) and a lack of appropriate supervision
enhanced the burden of professional responsibility (Palmer, 2014). A perceived lack of
support, empathy, and understanding from supervisors and managers increased reported
stress (James & Wright, 1991; Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008; Palmer, 2014; Coxon et al.,
2016). Management were perceived as being too distant from the role to truly understand
its demands (Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008), whilst in one study supervisors were reported
as actively discouraging emotional expression (Shuler & Sypher, 2000). Additionally, some
operatives felt that a healthy work-life balance was not always encouraged by supervisors
(Palmer, 2014).
Operatives also perceived failures by management to tackle conflict amongst colleagues.
Reference was made to difficulties and misunderstandings resulting from a perceived
dispatcher-paramedic divide (Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015; Coxon et al.,
2016), and the seemingly invisible nature of the role (Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008).
Making an effort to improve relationships with other colleagues was perceived as reducing
some of this tension, although supervisors did not generally facilitate this relationship-
building activity (Coxon et al., 2016). Ambulance operatives reported that bullying and
inappropriate behaviour by colleagues was not properly addressed by management,
causing an additional strain (Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008).
2b: seeking social support from peers, friends and family. Peer support was commonly
regarded as necessary to reduce the emotional burden of the work of EDC operatives.
This was the case for both informal (Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Palmer,
2014; Shakespeare-Finch, Rees & Armstrong, 2014; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong,
2015; Coxon et al., 2016) and more formal forms of peer support, such as having trained peer
support officers available (Shakespeare-Finch, Rees & Armstrong, 2014). There appeared to
be beneficial value from engaging in storytelling with colleagues; sharing anecdotes about
callers allowed police operatives to vent frustrations, and occasionally provided comic relief
(Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Shuler & Sypher, 2000). The use of black humour between peers was
also mentioned by ambulance operatives (Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015).
One study found no effect on stress and coping amongst those operatives who received
critical incident stress debriefing with peers, compared to those who did not (Jenkins, 1997).
Another study found that staff were cynical about a formal peer support service, doubting
the value and confidentiality of the service (Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008), whilst poor
communication with co-workers was an additional stressor (Coxon et al., 2016).
Work-life balance, such as adequate time off and outside interests, was considered vital, as
was support from family and friends (Palmer, 2014; Shakespeare-Finch, Rees & Armstrong,
2014; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015). Fire and police operatives who
reported less social support experienced greater psychological distress following exposure
Golding et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3735
20/29
 to a hurricane (Jenkins, 1997), whilst having adequate social support was associated
with reduced stress levels and better psychological health across all services (Jenkins,
1997; Shakespeare-Finch, Rees & Armstrong, 2014; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong,
2015). Not all operatives, however, reported gaining benefits from social support. Some
reported feeling that friends and family lacked understanding, and so operatives sometimes
chose not to discuss their job with them (Coxon et al., 2016). Ambulance operatives
reported that job stress and long working hours affected their personal lives (Gallagher &
McGilloway, 2008), and fire operatives reported that technology such as mobile phones
made it hard to get adequate distance from the role (Palmer, 2014).
2c: providing an emotionally demanding public service. EDC operatives experienced
stronger emotional reactions to certain calls, particularly those related to children,
suicides, and premature deaths (Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Forslund, Kihlgren & Kihlgren, 2004;
Gallagher & McGilloway, 2008). Dealing with inappropriate callers was also frustrating for
operatives (Tracy & Tracy, 1998). The nature of the role, however, requires EDC operatives
to remain calm and in control of their emotions when interacting with the public (Tracy
& Tracy, 1998; Shuler & Sypher, 2000). Operatives reported that maintaining emotional
neutrality and not expressing anger and frustration is vital for managing calls effectively,
and operatives have to absorb the caller’s frustrations and anxieties (Doerner, 1987; Jenkins,
1997; Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Sprigg, Armitage & Hollis, 2007; Coxon
et al., 2016). Maintaining this emotional neutrality can be challenging, especially when
operatives self-identified with the situation (Forslund, Kihlgren & Kihlgren, 2004; Adams,
Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015).
Operatives reported that sharing emotional experiences with peers could bring benefits,
especially through the use of humour and storytelling (James & Wright, 1991; Tracy
& Tracy, 1998; Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015).
However, organisational culture sometimes resulted in a lack of opportunities in which
to express emotions (Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Coxon et al., 2016), and
operatives did not always share their emotions with colleagues (Tracy & Tracy, 1998; Shuler
& Sypher, 2000).
Despite the obvious importance of the role, EDC operatives reported feeling invisible,
and not fully recognised for their work, by the public, by their family, and sometimes by
their colleagues, which was another source of stress (James & Wright, 1991; Gallagher &
McGilloway, 2008; Coxon et al., 2016). This feeling was common across different emergency
services, as well as different countries. Nonetheless, operatives did gain some benefit from
feeling that they were playing an altruistic role in their service provision (Doerner, 1987;
Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Palmer, 2014).
Potential bias in the review
The findings of the narrative review were inevitably limited by the design of the studies
included. Although common themes were identified across different study designs, the
review highlighted a lack of longitudinal and experimental research. Thus, conclusions
drawn about the relationships between EDC-related stressors and the psychological health
Golding et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3735
21/29
 of EDC operatives may be limited by the methodological approaches employed in the
original studies.
DISCUSSION
Research examining Emergency Dispatch Centre (EDC) operatives’ psychological health
is limited. This narrative review identified that EDC operatives across different emergency
services consistently reported their job as highly stressful, and this stress sometimes affected
their psychological health. It also highlighted a lack of longitudinal studies exploring the
long-term effects on psychological health of working in an EDC.
Workload demands and supervisory difficulties were frequent concerns. Although
EDC operatives do receive supervision and training, some operatives considered their
training and supervision to be inadequate, which they reported exacerbated their stress.
Poor supervision, a lack of understanding by management, and the pressures of being
monitored have also been identified as potential stressors amongst staff in other call-centre
and medical settings (Deery, Iverson & Walsh, 2002; Dean & Rainnie, 2009; Taylor et al.,
2013; Johansen, 2014).
Frustrations arose amongst EDC operatives from a perceived lack of control over
their workload, and this might have implications for their wellbeing and retention, as
perceptions of job control amongst non-emergency call-centre agents are related to job
satisfaction (Grebner et al., 2003). Furthermore, an excessive and demanding workload is a
common feature across call-centre work, and this may lead to emotional exhaustion and
burnout (Deery, Iverson & Walsh, 2002; Dean & Rainnie, 2009; Rod & Ashill, 2013; Taylor
et al., 2013).
The nature of the calls is another source of considerable stress. Although EDC operatives
do not experience emergencies first hand, operatives can experience vicarious trauma
as a result of some of the calls they handle. Research exploring the effects of job-related
exposure to trauma in emergency department personnel (Lin et al., 2007; Adriaenssens,
De Gucht & Maes, 2015) and trainee paramedics (Fjeldheim et al., 2014) suggests that such
exposure can have negative impacts on health and wellbeing, and may contribute to
burnout (Adriaenssens, De Gucht & Maes, 2015) and compassion fatigue (Van Mol et al.,
2015). It seems reasonable to assume that EDC operatives are at risk of similar outcomes.
The findings from this review indicate that some EDC operatives do indeed experience
symptoms associated with negative psychological health and high levels of psychological
stress, including increased alcohol use, disturbed sleep, and unwanted flashbacks related
to calls. Similar symptoms, along with high rates of depression and post-traumatic stress
disorder symptomology, have been reported in both trainee (Fjeldheim et al., 2014) and
qualified (Hegg-Deloye et al., 2014) paramedics.
EDC operatives are therefore likely to be at risk of emotional exhaustion and burnout,
which may contribute to high absence rates seen amongst this group (South East Coast
Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, 2015). Some EDC operatives experience conflict
and abuse from callers, which could further contribute to burnout. Call handlers working
for a telecommunications company who believed customers were more abusive experienced
Golding et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3735
22/29
 greater emotional exhaustion (Deery, Iverson & Walsh, 2002). Additionally, those who
reported higher levels of emotional exhaustion also had higher rates of absence (Deery,
Iverson & Walsh, 2002). Burnout rates in other emergency medical personnel are also high
(Lin et al., 2007; Popa et al., 2010; Adriaenssens, De Gucht & Maes, 2015), although this can
vary by context (Popa et al., 2010; Gokcen et al., 2013). Educational programmes may help
to reduce compassion fatigue and burnout (Flarity, Gentry & Mesnikoff, 2013).
Some EDC operatives reported using strategies to mitigate some of the negative effects
of workplace stressors; strategies included the use of emotion regulation and engaging in
peer support. Some of the evidence from this review, however, suggests the EDC work
environment does not always provide opportunities for sufficient peer support. Existing
research from other emergency medical settings suggests that the peer support element of
team working can be beneficial for managing stress and preventing burnout (Beaton et al.,
1997; Halpern et al., 2012). Future interventions may therefore need to focus on increasing
opportunities for peer support, to build resilience amongst EDC operatives.
It is clear from the review that working as an EDC operative is highly demanding, and
that stress will be inevitable at times. Interventions in the form of cognitive behaviour
therapy or mindfulness (Hülsheger et al., 2014; Querstret et al., 2016; Querstret, Cropley &
Fife-Schaw, 2017) have been shown to reduce potential negative effects of working in highly
demanding environments. Future research could explore how similar interventions might
help EDC staff to cope effectively with work-related stress.
It should also be noted that despite the challenges of the role, and the potential risks for
psychological health, the studies reviewed did identify some of the more positive aspects
of the role. EDC operatives enjoy performing an altruistic role, and reported gaining
emotional competence as they gained experience, with some operatives also experiencing
post-traumatic growth. The EDC work environment is fast-paced, demanding, and varied,
which operatives saw as a key reason they enjoy their work and remain in the role. Indeed,
exploring why some operatives experience higher levels of role-related benefits and fewer
negative effects on their psychological health might indicate potential areas to intervene
with their colleagues who do not have such positive experiences.
The findings from this review therefore highlight the unique combination of challenges
faced by EDC operatives. The role combines features of both regular call-centres
and emergency settings. Operatives report facing a psychologically demanding work
environment, and at times, the workload can seem relentless. Although some operatives
appear to thrive on the challenge, a significant proportion of the EDC workforce report
experiencing negative effects on their psychological health as a result of their work. Future
research should focus on exploring whether workplace-based interventions can improve
the psychological health of those EDC operatives who are negatively affected.
LIMITATIONS
Search strings were devised to capture a broad range of studies, and a number of common
themes were identified. The diversity of EDC populations studied (across time, role, and
location) means that the relative importance of each theme is likely to vary between
Golding et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3735
23/29
 each sub-population of EDC operatives; there were, however, insufficient publications
to enable differences between the emergency services to be explored. As there is a lack
of recent evidence in particular, the findings of the review are potentially both time-
and context-bound. Results should be interpreted with caution as findings are based on
a limited number of high quality studies and there was heterogeneity in study design.
Nonetheless, there was evidence of consistency across studies, as the themes identified were
supported by evidence from all three emergency services, suggesting that the findings of
the review are likely to be relevant to all types of EDC operatives.
The review was intended to capture longitudinal and intervention studies, but none
were identified during searching. The included studies do provide insight into the stresses
experienced by EDC operatives, but findings are limited by a lack of data on long-term
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
EDC operatives report experiencing stress as a result of their work, which appears to
be related to negative psychological health outcomes, such as emotional exhaustion and
burnout. There is, however, a lack of evidence exploring how EDC work-related stress
affects operatives’ psychological health over the longer term. Furthermore, most of the
studies reviewed only set out to explore potential negative effects on EDC operatives’
psychological health. It is therefore important for future research to explore the positive
aspects of the role that operatives value, and to better understand the factors that may
contribute to resilience and good psychological health amongst this group.
Future research should also aim to explore the relationships between EDC-related
stressors and long-term psychological health outcomes. If longitudinal studies support the
main findings of this review, that EDC employment can negatively affect psychological
health, there should also be efforts to develop interventions aimed at minimising the impact
of EDC work on the psychological health of EDC operatives.
