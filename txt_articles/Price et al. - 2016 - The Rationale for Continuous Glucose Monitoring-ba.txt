Glucose Monitoring Use

Abstract
Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is now recognised as a core component of diabetes self-management. However, there are many 
limitations to SMBG use in individuals with diabetes who are treated with intensive insulin regimens. Many individuals do not test at the 
recommended frequencies. Additionally, because SMBG only provides a blood glucose reading at a single point in time, hypoglycaemia and 
hyperglycaemia can easily go undetected, limiting the user’s ability to take corrective action. Inaccuracies due to user error, environmental 
factors and weaknesses in SMBG system integrity further limit the utility of SMBG. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) displays 
the current glucose, direction and velocity of glucose change and provides programmable alarms. This trending information and ‘around-
the-clock’ vigilance provides a significant safety advantage relative to SMBG. No published clinical studies have evaluated outcomes when 
CGM is used as a replacement for SMBG; however, recent in silico studies support this indication. This article reviews the limitations of 
SMBG and discusses recent evidence that supports CGM-based decisions as an effective approach to managing insulin-treated diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and advanced type 2 diabetes (T2D) require 
intensive insulin therapy in combination with frequent glucose 
monitoring to optimise glycaemic control. Although the value of 
achieving normoglycaemia has been well demonstrated,1 many 
individuals with insulin-treated diabetes are unable to meet established 
glycaemic targets without excessive and/or severe hypoglycaemia.2–5 
The introduction of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) devices in 
the late 1970s provided a tool for assessing current glucose levels, to 
calculate insulin dosages and inform decisions. When first introduced, 
SMBG met with scepticism, as some clinicians doubted the accuracy 
of the devices and that patients would know how to appropriately 
respond to the blood glucose data. Studies soon demonstrated the 
utility of SMBG in limited populations6,7 and in 1993 the benefit of SMBG-
based intensive diabetes management was validated in the Diabetes 
Control and Complication Trial.1 
SMBG is now recognised as a core component of diabetes self-
management.8–11 However, given recent advances in the accuracy, 
reliability and usability of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), 
accurate CGM systems may now be capable of replacing SMBG as a 
primary source of glucose information. The purpose of this report is 
to review the limitations of SMBG and discuss recent evidence that 
supports CGM-based decisions as an effective approach to managing 
insulin-treated diabetes.12,13 
Limitations of Self-Monitoring of Blood 
Glucose-based Decisions
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that patients 
on intensive insulin regimens, multiple-dose insulin (MDI) or continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) should consider SMBG prior to 
meals and snacks, occasionally following meals, at bedtime, prior to 
exercise, when low glucose is suspected, after treating low glucose and 
prior to critical tasks such as driving. For many patients, this will require 
testing six to 10 (or more) times daily.14 Other organisations provide 
similar recommendations.10,11
Many individuals do not test at the recommended frequencies. 
 
A recent survey of 16,061 participants in the T1D Exchange registry 
reported that 34% (n=3,630) performed SMBG zero to three times 
daily,3 supporting an earlier survey that found SMBG non-adherence 
to be as high as 60%.15 There are many reasons for non-adherence, 
including the pain and ‘hassle’ of testing and the perceived limited 
utility of the results.16 The numerous steps required to perform a 
 
blood glucose measurement, contributing to the hassle factor, are 
shown in Table 1.

Hypoglycaemia Remains Problematic
Although numerous studies have shown that frequent SMBG 
 
is associated with improved glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c),1,15–17 it is 
not associated with decreased hypoglycaemia.4,5 Even with relatively 
frequent testing (9.2 ± 2.3 tests/day), many patients have frequent 
and prolonged hypoglycaemia.18 Despite use of analogue insulins and 
increased use of CSII, hypoglycaemia remains problematic for patients 
and healthcare providers.5 The T1D Exchange recently noted that 
11.8% of individuals with T1D reported having severe hypoglycaemia, 
resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure in the past year; severe 
hypoglycaemia was reported by almost one in five individuals with 
diabetes of 40 years duration.19 A recent study by Cariou and colleagues 
found a self-reported rate of severe hypoglycaemia (including those 
requiring third-party assistance) in 31% of individuals with T1D in the 
prior year. In a prospective assessment, 84.4% of individuals reported 
non-severe hypoglycaemia during one month, with an average of 7.1 
confirmed events per patient per month.5 Further, the frequency of 
hypoglycaemia increased in parallel with the number of daily SMBG 
tests. This suggests that frequent, episodic monitoring is insufficient to 
prevent frequent or severe hypoglycaemia.
Obtaining glucose data via SMBG is dependent upon the user’s decision 
to self-monitor. Accordingly, SMBG will often fail to detect nocturnal and 
asymptomatic hypoglycaemia.20,21 Frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia 
contribute to diminished hypoglycaemic awareness, and individuals 
with impaired awareness are at high risk for severe hypoglycaemia.22,23 
Nocturnal hypoglycaemia remains a common problem and a risk factor 
for sudden death during sleep.24
Furthermore, frequent hypoglycaemia results in increased fear of 
hypoglycaemia25 and this becomes a barrier to intensifying therapy or 
adhering to prescribed insulin regimens.2,26 This fear often leads to poor 
metabolic control27 and may result in individuals avoiding driving, and 
limiting exercise or sex.28
Diabetes Management is Complex and 
Challenging 
Glucose fluctuations in T1D are often unpredictable and related to many 
factors including, but not limited to: variability of food absorption; insulin 
absorption and insulin action; effects of macro- and micronutrients; 
duration and intensity of exercise; stress; and, physiological changes. 
This challenge has been recognised since the introduction of insulin.29
The episodic nature of SMBG provides users with a blood glucose 
reading at a single point in time. It does not provide trend information, 
the direction and velocity of change in glucose or alerts. Without 
this information, hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia can easily go 
undetected, limiting the user’s ability to take corrective action.30,31 
Potential for Inaccurate Blood Glucose 
Readings
Because clinical decisions are based on SMBG values, the results 
should be accurate, to ensure safe and effective treatment decisions 
are made.32 Although manufacturers have made advances in strip and 
meter technologies to improve the performance and reliability of their 
systems, measurement accuracy remains suboptimal. Inaccuracy may 
stem from inadequate manufacturing practices and controls.33,34 Recent 
studies have demonstrated that >45% of marketed SMBG systems do 
not meet the minimum International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) accuracy standards.33–35 However, even when the most accurate 
monitoring systems are used, physiological, pharmacological and 
human factors can compromise accuracy.36 To date, no prospective 
studies of SMBG accuracy in the home under ‘real-world’ conditions 
have been performed. Furthermore, even accurate measurements 
provide incomplete data because there is no information on the 
direction or rate of change (ROC). The lack of this information adds 
uncertainty to clinical decisions, as shown in Figure 1. 
User technique can also play a significant role in the accuracy of 
blood glucose monitoring systems.36,37 Potential human errors include 
incorrect testing procedure (e.g. inadequate sample size, improper 
sample application or miscoding of strips) and improper strip handling 
(e.g. storage in high temperatures, storage outside the test strip vial and 
use past the expiration date). Improper cleaning of the sampling site 
has long been recognised as a contributing to user error.36,38 However, 
the most common limitation of SMBG remains failure to test. 
Limitations of Self-Monitoring of  
Blood Glucose
SMBG-based decisions are limited based on inaccuracies and failure 
to test, and this is compounded by the absence of alarms and glucose 
trend information. These limitations complicate the inherent complexity 
of diabetes management and contribute to poor control.39 Recent 
evidence suggests that CGM-based decisions may be more effective12,13 
and Table 2 highlights some of the differences between SMBG- and 
CGM-based decisions.

Advantages of Real-time Continuous  
Glucose Monitoring
Real-time CGM displays the current glucose, direction and velocity 
of glucose change and provides programmable alarms (see Figure 
2). Trending information and ‘around-the-clock’ vigilance provides a 
significant safety advantage relative to SMBG. The ability of CGM devices 
to alert not only the patient but also friends and family represents 
an area in which these devices reduce the duration and severity of 
hypoglycaemia.13 Some CGM devices enable users to share their glucose 
data, providing another level of safety. 
The ability to download CGM data facilitates retrospective analysis of 
glucose data, allowing patients and their healthcare teams to detect 
glucose patterns/trends that facilitate therapeutic adjustments. This is 
in contrast to retrospective analysis of SMBG data, which is dependent 
on the timing and frequency of episodic measurements, providing an 
incomplete or biased understanding of glucose patterns. 
Clinical Efficacy of Continuous Glucose 
Monitoring
Numerous studies have shown that use of CGM lowers HbA1c, reduces 
hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia40–45 and improves quality of life46 in 
children and adults using either CSII or MDI.40–45,47–50 Similar to medication 
adherence, the benefit of CGM is primarily seen in adherent CGM 
patients, i.e. those who regularly used their devices.40,44 
How Patients Currently Use Real-time 
Continuous Glucose Monitoring
Use of Alarms, Alerts and Glucose Rate of  
Change Arrows
Clinical benefits of CGM use have been demonstrated in both CSII and 
MDI users. However, unlike with medications, improved outcomes are 
due to behavioural changes in response to the CGM data and not by 
CGM use per se. To date, few studies have specifically looked at how 
individuals utilise CGM data.13,46 
In a recent crossover study by Battelino and colleagues looking at CGM 
benefit among T1D individuals using CSII, investigators reported lower 
HbA1c when CGM was used.43 CGM use was associated with significant 
increases in the mean number of daily boluses (6.8 ± 2.5 versus 5.8 ± 1.9, 
p<0.0001), frequency of temporary basal rates (0.75 ± 1.11 versus 0.26 ± 
0.47, p<0.0001) and frequency of manual insulin suspension (0.91 ± 1.25 
 
versus 0.70 ± 0.75, p<0.018). Investigators concluded that frequent 
insulin self-adjustments may have contributed to HbA1c improvement. 
A key feature differentiating CGM from SMBG and other emerging 
technologies such as ‘flash’ glucose monitoring (e.g. the FreeStyle Libre 
Flash, Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, US) is the presence of alerts 
and alarms. New and colleagues51 evaluated the potential of using CGM 
with the alerts disabled. Unlike when alerts were active, there was no 
significant reduction in the time spent in hypoglycaemia compared to 
SMBG when CGM alerts were silenced. 
Pettus and colleagues reported findings from a survey of 222 T1D 
individuals using a CGM device for greater than one year. The objective of 
the survey was to assess how individuals utilise real-time CGM data and 
respond to their glucose information.13 Most respondents reported using 
a customised low glucose alert set between 3.3 and 5.5 mmol/L (60–100 
mg/dl); only 1% of respondents relied on only the fixed 3.0 mmol/L (55 
mg/dL) low alarm, which is unique to Dexcom CGM systems. Whereas 
44% of respondents stated that they would feel symptomatic from 
hypoglycaemia prior to being alerted via their alarm, 33% felt that they 
were alerted prior to symptoms occurring. Importantly, 70% reported 
waking up at night at least once per week in response to their low 
glucose alert and 42% stated that in the last six months their CGM device 
alerted somebody around them to their hypoglycaemia alarm when they 
themselves were unable to respond. Since starting CGM, 78% reported a 
decrease in the frequency and severity of hypoglycaemia. 
Respondents also reported use of ROC information to make significant 
correction and mealtime dosage adjustments larger than previously 
recommended,52–54 resulting in speculation that respondents felt 
confident in the performance of their CGM device. Respondents 
reported that using CGM helped them achieve better control and 
improve their quality of life. In a subsequent report, both MDI and CSII 
users demonstrated similar insulin dose adjustments based on ROC.55
Increasing Reliance on the Use of Continuous 
Glucose Monitoring Data
Recent studies indicate that CGM users perform less frequent SMBG, 
suggesting that they are basing management decisions on CGM data.

EUROPEAN ENDOCRINOLOGY

Of 11 CGM outcome studies reported since 2008, six trials did not 
report frequency of SMBG use; however, five trials quantified reductions 
in SMBG frequency (see Table 3).43,56–58 Data from the T1D Exchange 
registry demonstrates that most patients reduce SMBG frequency after 
initiating CGM.59
Decision support is enhanced by CGM; a user simply needs to 
press a button to see a glucose value and trend. Each screen view 
provides an opportunity to evaluate current glucose management. 
The frequency and benefit of CGM receiver interaction were reported 
in 2008 by Bailey and colleagues.60 They examined the number of 
‘screen views’ seen in subjects in a CGM trial, dividing the views into 
frequency quartiles. Screen views ranged from an average of 12.2 per 
day in the bottom quartile to 47.2 per day in the top quartile. Subjects 
in the top quartile had improvement in HbA1c compared with those in 
the bottom quartile (p<0.0001).  
 
Current Dexcom Continuous Glucose 
Monitoring Technology Can Support Safe and 
Effective Treatment Decision-making
A common metric for assessment of accuracy of both SMBG and 
CGM devices is the aggregate mean absolute relative difference 
(MARD) between all temporally matched device data and reference 
measurements. Recent independent studies have shown that MARD 
values for current SMBG systems range from 4.4% to 13.4% when 
evaluated by independent investigators under optimal conditions, using 
fresh test strips and performed by trained professionals using split 
aliquot samples.61–63 Although CGM users were historically instructed to 
base clinical decisions on SMBG values, CGM technologies have made 
significant improvements and are approaching SMBG accuracy. To date, 
no published clinical studies have evaluated outcomes when CGM is 
used as a replacement for SMBG. However, recent in silico studies 
support this indication.12,64,65
Impact on Hypoglycaemia and Hyperglycaemia
A Monte Carlo simulation compared the impact of determining a pre-
meal insulin dose using SMBG glucose value versus a CGM glucose value 
and ROC on the frequency of post-meal hypoglycaemia (3.8 mmol/L 
 
[<70 mg/dL]), and hyperglycaemia (>10 mmol/L [>180 mg/dl]).64 This 
simulation did not include use of alerts and alarms and was not based on 
current CGM technology. Both glucose monitoring methods performed 
similarly when glucose levels were stable. However, at declining ROC, 
SMBG-based decisions resulted in a higher frequency of hypoglycaemia 
and a lower frequency of hyperglycaemia compared with CGM-based 
decisions. This is because CGM users reduced their insulin dose in 
response to falling glucose. The opposite was true at rising glucose 
when CGM users increased their insulin dosages, resulting in decreased 
hyperglycaemia rates and increased hypoglycaemia rates relative to 
decisions based on SMBG. Again, this simulation did not include alerts, 
which would serve to mitigate hypoglycaemia. A follow-up simulation 
confirmed that use of low glucose alerts minimised hypoglycaemia.66
Safe Insulin Dosing Using Continuous Glucose 
Monitoring Data 
In a recent in silico study,12 investigators assessed the level of accuracy 
required for safe insulin dosing using CGM data. In one scenario, the 
current CGM value, with and without ROC adjustments, was used to 
make insulin dosing decisions. In a second scenario, dosing decisions 
utilised threshold alerts at 3.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and 10.0 mmol/L 
(180 mg/dL) with and without ROC adjustments. Each modality was 
assessed at seven levels of sensor accuracy, as measured by MARD, 
ranging from 3% to 22%.
As shown in Figure 3A, the frequency of blood glucose episodes 
 
<2.1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) increased with sensor error, displaying a 
notable slope change at 10% MARD. Similar increases were seen in the 
percentage of time spent at glucose levels >13.8 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)

(see Figure 3B). Most importantly, significant benefits were seen when 
threshold alarms were used in conjunction with dose adjustments 
based on glucose ROC; an option that is not possible with SMBG. 
Based on these findings, investigators concluded that use of CGM data 
for insulin dosing decisions is feasible below a 10% MARD. Moreover, 
improvements in sensor accuracy below the 10% MARD threshold would 
not contribute substantively to better glycaemic outcomes. This analysis 
also highlighted the pivotal role CGM alerts play in improving outcomes. 
Improving Glycaemic Control with Continuous 
Glucose Monitoring with Alarms and 
Corrections for Glucose Trend 
An assessment of SMBG versus CGM-based decisions was performed 
in a validated model using in-silico patients and demonstrated that 
the use of the additional information provided by CGM (e.g. trend 
and hypoglycaemic/hyperglycaemic alarms) resulted in a statistically 
significant (~9%) increase in time spent euglycaemic 3.8–10.0 mmol/L 
(70–180 mg/dL) when compared with dosing based on SMBG values.65 
Investigators found that use of CGM in place of SMBG for insulin bolus 
calculation did not adversely impact the safety or effectiveness of 
dosing decisions. Moreover, the combination of the use of CGM glucose 
values, trends and alerts significantly improves glycaemic control 
compared with SMBG-based therapy decisions.
Non-adjunctive Criteria for Continuous 
Glucose Monitoring-based Diabetes 
Management
Due to a marked improvement in accuracy,67,68 the Dexcom G5 Mobile (DG5) 
is now indicated to replace SMBG for routine diabetes treatment decisions 
outside the US (receiving the Conformité Européenne [CE] mark). The 
following is a summary of the indication statement included in the CE mark 
document.69 
• The DG5 is indicated for the management of diabetes in persons aged 
two years and older. 
• The DG5 is designed to replace finger-stick blood glucose testing for 
diabetes treatment decisions. 
• The DG5 aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycaemia and 
hypoglycaemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments.
• Interpretation of the DG5 results should be based on the glucose trends 
and several sequential readings over time. 
Evidence of Accuracy and Efficacy
Christiansen and colleagues70 compared the accuracy and performance 
of a new-generation CGM system, Dexcom G4 Platinum (G4P) with a 
previous-generation device, Dexcom SevenPlus (DSP). Investigators 
found that the aggregate MARD for the G4P sensor was 13% compared 
with 16% for DSP (p<0.0001); approximately 50% of the G4P sensors 
had a MARD <12.5% compared with 14% for the DSP sensors (p=0.028). 
In collaboration with an academic research group further refinements 
were made to the G4P algorithm.71
In 2015, Bailey and colleagues reported their assessment of the 
performance of the modified G4P system with the addition of a new 
calibration algorithm called ‘Software 505’. This algorithm is found 
in the DG5.67 In comparison with the laboratory reference method, 
the system achieved a MARD of 9%. The Mean Absolute Difference 
(MAD) for the modified G4P system was 0.35 mmol/L (6.4 mg/dL) 
within hypoglycaemia ranges ≤3.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dl). Assessment 
of individual sensor performance, which is a better reflection of the 
patient experience, found few outlier sensors. Among the 51 sensors, 
only one had >20% MARD (on day one) and three sensors had >15% 
MARD. Other CGM devices are approaching the 10% MARD accuracy 
target.72,73 One other device, the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose 
monitoring system (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA), received 
the CE mark as a replacement for SMBG when dosing insulin except 
when glucose is changing rapidly or when hypoglycaemic; however, 
lack of alerts/alarms may limit its utility in detecting immediate or 
impending hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. Other CGM systems, 
such as the Medtronic Veo or 640G are integrated into insulin pumps 
and have regulatory approval for the system to suspend insulin 
based on CGM data but do not allow users to base clinical decisions 
primarily on CGM values. 
Peyser and colleagues recently assessed the modified G4P system 
to determine the optimum setting of hypoglycaemic alerts. Results 
of the study showed that when the hypoglycaemic alert was set at 
4.4 mmol/L (80 mg/dL), the device provided an alert for biochemical 
hypoglycaemia (3.8 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]) within ten minutes in 95% 
of instances and at least a ten-minute advance warning before the 
cognitive impairment threshold (3.0 mmol/L [55 mg/dL]) in 91% of 
instances in the study.68 These findings demonstrate that use of a 
 
4.4 mmol/L (80 mg/dL) threshold setting for hypoglycaemic alerts on 
the DG5 may provide patients with an actionable warning of impending 
hypoglycaemia before the onset of cognitive impairment. 
Limitations of Continuous Glucose Monitoring
Despite ongoing improvements in CGM technology, challenges remain 
which impact sensor reliability and performance. Signal disruptions 
can occur from a variety of causes, including micro-motion of the 
sensor, local blood flow changes and wireless connectivity problems. 
These can result in data gaps that may impact alerts and limit acute 
management decisions.
Sensor compression can occur when individuals lay on top of their 
sensor for a prolonged period, such as when sleeping. These signal 
disruptions typically result in a false low CGM glucose and are not likely 
to have safety-related implications.74 Additionally, sensor motion can 
result in inflammation around the sensor site.75–78 Furthermore, a foreign 
body response occurs and can be influenced by the sensor shape,79 
size80 and surface typography.81 
Lag time between interstitial glucose and blood glucose remains a 
consideration when basing decisions on CGM. The lag time between 
when glucose concentration changes appear in the blood and when they 
appear in the interstitial fluid can be variable between CGM systems.82,83 
This is influenced by sensor geometry, sensor membranes, algorithmic 
filtering, direction and ROC.82,83 The DG5 demonstrated an average lag 
time of five to six minutes during clinical testing.67
Other factors which can adversely impact sensor accuracy and 
performance include interference from medications containing 
paracetamol (acetaminophen),84 failure to calibrate according to 
manufacturer recommendations and use in populations outside of the 
current indications. 
To ensure safe and efficacious CGM use for treatment decisions, users 
should adhere to the following safety guidelines.69
• If the CGM device does not display a sensor glucose reading or is 
displaying inconsistent readings, users should perform a finger-stick 
blood glucose value for diabetes treatment decisions. 
 The Rationale for CGM-Based Diabetes Treatment Decisions and Non-Adjunctive CGM Use
EUROPEAN ENDOCRINOLOGY
29
• Users should make diabetes treatment decisions considering 
 
the combination of the sensor glucose reading, trend arrow, and 
trend graph. 
• If glucose alerts and readings do not match symptoms or 
expectations, users should obtain a finger-stick blood glucose value 
to make diabetes treatment decisions.
The benefits of CGM-based decisions are realised only when there is 
action, such as modification of lifestyle or medication, based on the 
glucose results. This requires both the patient and the clinician to know 
how to monitor, interpret and respond appropriately to acute glucose 
excursions and patterns of glycaemia. Table 4 presents criteria for 
effective use of glucose data.
Summary 
Glucose monitoring in diabetes is integral to achieving desired glycaemic 
control. The introduction of SMBG devices in the late 1970s provided 
an improved but imperfect tool for diabetes management. Numerous 
factors can significantly limit the utility of SMBG for decision-making. 
New evidence demonstrates that CGM-based treatment may be a more 
effective approach to manage diabetes.12,13,64,65 As reported by Pettus and 
colleagues, many CGM users report substantial safety benefits with CGM 
alerts. Further, they use glucose ROC information to make significant 
modifications to many aspects of their diabetes management.13
The clinical benefit of CGM technology is dependent upon both the 
accuracy,12 persistence of use40,44 and presence of alerts/alarms;13 
CGM accuracy can impact both the clinical utility12,64,65 and patient 
acceptance.85–88 It is likely that a highly accurate CGM that reliably 
provides alerts will engender trust. 
One CGM system has achieved a level of accuracy where the glucose 
value can be used for clinical decision-making. This could spare 
patients the hassle and pain of additional finger-sticks and provide 
them more actionable glucose information. The safety of using current 
CGM technology as the primary source of glucose data is being 
evaluated in the ongoing REPLACE-BG study (NCT02258373).89 Further 
studies comparing CGM-based decisions and non-adjunctive CGM use 
are needed in specific populations, such as children, older individuals, 
newly diagnosed individuals, pregnant women and people who are 
prone to severe hypoglycaemia.
Given the growing incidence of diabetes (T1D and T2D)90 and the persistent 
problems associated with hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, new 
tools are needed. In order to reduce the global burden of diabetes the 
consequences of poor glucose control must be addressed and the 
individual’s burden in managing their disease must be reduced. CGM-
based decisions, by providing alerts and showing an individual where 
the glucose was and where it is going, removes some of the uncertainty 
and risks of diabetes management. Minimising finger-sticks further 
unencumbers the individual. Using accurate CGM system to replace SMBG 
for diabetes management decisions should facilitate greater acceptance 
and perseverance with CGM and lead to better long-term outcomes. ■
Table 4: Criteria for Effective Utilisation of 
Glucose Monitoring Data
 
Provider Requirements
• Establish realistic goals with patients
• Encourage the adoption of 
technologies which inform better 
clinical decisions but communicate 
limitations
• Review device use and requirements 
with patients 
• For continuous glucose monitoring, 
discuss the value of alerts and 
alarms, assist in defining settings, 
and modify to avoid ‘alarm fatigue’
• Review the patient’s glucose data 
at every clinical visit and discuss 
therapeutic and behaviour changes  
 
• Provide encouragement and help 
patients overcome barriers to 
glucose monitoring 
 
Patient Requirements
•  Align your goals with your clinician
• Work with your clinician to establish 
realistic expectations of device 
performance; understand limitations 
• Perform recommended blood 
glucose monitoring, whether used for 
treatment decisions or calibration 
• For continuous glucose monitoring, 
use alerts and alarms to 
manage and prevent hypo- and 
hyperglycaemia
• Reflect back on your glucose data to 
learn what worked well and what did 
not. Adjust therapy and behaviour  
based on the glucose data, per  
your clinician
• Recognise that for glucose 
monitoring to improve control, the 
device must be used; discuss and 
overcome barriers
