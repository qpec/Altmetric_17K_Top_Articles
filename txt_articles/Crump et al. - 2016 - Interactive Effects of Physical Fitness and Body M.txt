Abstract
IMPORTANCE—High body mass index (BMI) and low physical fitness are risk factors for 
hypertension, but their interactive effects are unknown. Elucidation of interactions between these 
modifiable risk factors may help inform more effective interventions in susceptible subgroups.
OBJECTIVE—To determine the interactive effects of BMI and physical fitness on the risk of 
hypertension in a large national cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—This cohort study included all 1 547 189 
military conscripts in Sweden from January 1, 1969, through December 31, 1997 (97%–98% of all 
18-year-old men nationwide each year), who were followed up through December 31, 2012 
(maximum age, 62 years). Data analysis was conducted August 1 through August 15, 2015.
EXPOSURES—Standardized aerobic capacity, muscular strength, and BMI measurements 
obtained at a military conscription examination.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Hypertension identified from outpatient and inpatient 
diagnoses.

 RESULTS—A total of 93 035 men (6.0%) were diagnosed with hypertension in 39.7 million 
person-years of follow-up. High BMI and low aerobic capacity (but not muscular strength) were 
associated with increased risk of hypertension, independent of family history and socioeconomic 
factors (BMI, overweight or obese vs normal: incidence rate ratio, 2.51; 95% CI, 2.46–2.55; P < .
001; aerobic capacity, lowest vs highest tertile: incidence rate ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.47–1.54; P < .
001). Aerobic capacity was inversely associated with hypertension across its full distribution 
(incidence rate ratio per 100 W, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69–0.71; P < .001). A combination of high BMI 
(overweight or obese vs normal) and low aerobic capacity (lowest vs highest tertile) was 
associated with the highest risk of hypertension (incidence rate ratio, 3.53; 95% CI, 3.41–3.66; P 
< .001) and had a negative additive and multiplicative interaction (P < .001). Although high BMI 
was a significant risk factor for hypertension, low aerobic capacity also was a significant risk 
factor among those with normal BMI.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In this large national cohort study, high BMI and low 
aerobic capacity in late adolescence were associated with higher risk of hypertension in adulthood. 
If confirmed, our findings suggest that interventions to prevent hypertension should begin early in 
life and include not only weight control but aerobic fitness, even among persons with normal BMI.
Hypertension is one of the most common medical disorders, affecting 1 in 4 adults in the 
United States1 and worldwide,2 with a lifetime prevalence that may exceed 90%.3 Its 
prevalence has increased in the United States and worldwide during the past 20 years 
concurrently with increasing rates of obesity and a sedentary lifestyle.4 Hypertension is 
associated with increased risks of stroke, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, kidney 
disease, and premature mortality.5 Despite its health importance, hypertension has a low rate 
of successful treatment; as many as two-thirds of adults in the United States with 
hypertension are either untreated or undertreated.6 Because of the known difficulty of 
successfully treating hypertension as well as its large health burden, better primary 
prevention through lifestyle modifications is a major public health priority. High body mass 
index (BMI),7–11 low physical activity,10–15 and low physical fitness9,13,16 are established 
modifiable risk factors for hypertension. Physical fitness (particularly aerobic capacity) has 
been found to be a stronger predictor of cardiovascular disease than physical activity17 and a 
better indicator of habitual physical activity than self-reported activity.18 However, to our 
knowledge, interactive effects between physical fitness and BMI early in life have not been 
examined in association with risk of hypertension in adulthood. A better understanding of 
these common modifiable risk factors, including their combined and interactive effects, is 
needed to inform more effective preventive interventions.
We conducted a large cohort study to examine the interactive effects between physical 
fitness (including both aerobic capacity and muscular strength) and BMI in late adolescence 
in association with the risk of hypertension in adulthood. Aerobic capacity, muscular 
strength, and BMI were assessed using standardized measurements in approximately 1.5 
million 18-year-old male military conscripts in Sweden who were observed up to a 
maximum age of 62 years. Our aims were to examine interactions among aerobic capacity, 
muscular strength, and/or BMI in association with hypertension risk in a large national 
cohort, which may help inform more effective interventions early in life.

 Methods
Study Population
We identified 1547 478 men aged 18 years who underwent a military conscription 
examination in Sweden from January 1, 1969, through December 31, 1997. This 
examination was compulsory for all males aged approximately 18 years nationwide each 
year except for 2% to 3% who either were incarcerated or had severe chronic medical 
conditions or disabilities documented by a physician. We excluded 289 (0.02%) individuals 
who had a prior diagnosis of hypertension identified from hospital discharge diagnoses. A 
total of 1 547 189 men (>99.9% of the original cohort) remained for inclusion in the study. 
This study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Lund University in Sweden. 
Participant consent was not required for this study as it used only registry-based secondary 
data. To ensure confidentiality, all names and national identification numbers were replaced 
by anonymous serial numbers. The primary data analyses were conducted August 1 through 
August 15, 2015.
Ascertainment of Aerobic Capacity, Muscular Strength, and BMI
Aerobic capacity, muscular strength, and BMI measurements were obtained from the 
Swedish Military Conscription Registry, which contains information from a 2-day 
standardized physical and psychological examination required for all conscripts starting in 
1969. Aerobic capacity was measured as the maximal aerobic workload in watts, using a 
standard well-validated electrically braked stationary bicycle ergometer test, as previously 
described.19 Maximal aerobic workload is highly correlated with maximal oxygen uptake 
(correlation of approximately 0.9),20 and its measurement using this bicycle ergometer test 
is highly reproducible, with a test-retest correlation of 0.95.21 Muscular strength was 
measured as the weighted sum of maximal knee extension (weighted × 1.3), elbow flexion 
(weighted × 0.8), and hand grip (weighted × 1.7), each measured in newtons, using standard 
well-validated isometric dynamometer tests.22 Each dynamometer test was performed 3 
times and the maximum value was recorded for analysis, except when the last value was the 
highest value, in which case testing was repeated until strength values stopped increasing. 
Body mass index was determined using standardized height and weight measurements and 
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. All testing equipment 
was calibrated daily.19,22
Aerobic capacity and muscular strength were modeled alternatively as continuous variables 
or categorical variables intertiles (aerobic capacity in watts: low, <240; medium, 240–288; 
or high, ≥289; and muscular strength in newtons: low, <1900; medium, 1900–2170; or high, 
≥2171]). Body mass index was modeled alternatively as a continuous or categorical variable 
using definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for children 
and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years to facilitate comparability with US studies: overweight or 
obesity is defined as the 85th percentile or higher on the CDC’s 2000 sex-specific growth 
charts of BMI for age, which corresponds to a BMI of 25.6 or more for 18-year-old men.23

 Ascertainment of Hypertension
The study cohort was followed up through December 31, 2012, for essential (primary) 
hypertension, which was identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 
diagnosis codes (400–401 in ICD-8, 401 in ICD-9, and I10 in ICD-10) in the Swedish 
Hospital Registry and Swedish Outpatient Registry. The Swedish Hospital Registry contains 
all primary and secondary hospital discharge diagnoses from 6 populous counties in 
southern Sweden starting in 1964, with nationwide coverage starting in 1987; the Swedish 
Outpatient Registry contains outpatient diagnoses from all specialty clinics nationwide 
starting in 2001.
Adjustment Variables
Other variables that may be associated with hypertension were obtained from the Swedish 
Military Conscription Registry and national census data, which were linked using an 
anonymous personal identification number. The following were used as adjustment 
variables: year of the military conscription examination (modeled simultaneously as a 
continuous and categorical [1969–1979, 1980–1989, or 1990–1997] variable to account for 
follow-up time and attained age); family history of hypertension in a parent or sibling (yes 
or no; identified from diagnoses in the Swedish Hospital Registry during 1964–2012 and the 
Swedish Outpatient Registry during 2001–2012 using the same diagnostic codes as noted 
above, plus 444–445 in ICD-7); highest educational level attained during the study period 
(<12, 12–14, or ≥15 years); and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) at baseline 
(included because neighborhood SES characteristics have been associated with 
hypertension24,25 and with physical activity and BMI26; composed of an index that includes 
low educational level, low income, unemployment, and receipt of social welfare, as 
previously described27; categorized as low [>1 SD below the mean], medium [within 1 SD 
of the mean], or high [>1 SD above the mean]).
As alternatives to BMI, we also examined height and weight simultaneously in a separate 
model, which were modeled alternatively as continuous or categorical (height: <175, 175–
184, or ≥185 cm; weight: <60, 60–79, or ≥80 kg) variables. In addition, we examined 
income at last follow-up (continuous and categorical variable in tertiles) and neighborhood 
SES at last follow-up (categorical variable as noted above) as potential confounders; 
however, they were highly correlated with highest educational level attained and baseline 
neighborhood SES, and further adjustment for them had no effect on other risk estimates; 
hence, they were not included in the final analyses.
Missing data for each variable were imputed using a standard multiple imputation procedure 
based on the variable’s association with all other covariates.28 Missing data were relatively 
infrequent for aerobic capacity (88 189 [5.7%]), muscular strength (77 359 [5.0%]), height 
(111 397 [7.2%]), weight (112 944 [7.3%]), educational level (5615 [0.4%]), and 
neighborhood SES (140 794 [9.1%]). As an alternative to multiple imputation, sensitivity 
analyses were performed after restricting the cohort to individuals with complete data for all 
variables (1 361 083 [88.0%]).

 Statistical Analysis
Poisson regression with robust SEs was used to compute incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 
95% CIs for associations between aerobic capacity, muscular strength, or BMI and 
subsequent risk of hypertension.29 Two different adjusted models were performed: the first 
was adjusted for year of the military conscription examination (to account for follow-up 
time and attained age) and the second was additionally adjusted for aerobic capacity, 
muscular strength, BMI, family history of hypertension, educational level, and 
neighborhood SES (each as a categorical variable as defined above). Poisson model 
goodness-of-fit was assessed using deviance and Pearson χ2 tests, which showed a good fit 
in all models.
Interactions among aerobic capacity, muscular strength, and BMI on either the additive or 
multiplicative scale were examined in association with risk of hypertension. Additive 
interactions were assessed using relative excess risk owing to interaction (RERI), which is 
computed for binary variables as RERIIRR = IRR11 − IRR – IRR10 + 1.30,31 Multiplicative 
interactions were assessed using the ratio of IRRs: IRR11/(IRR10 × IRR01).30 All statistical 
tests were 2-sided and significance was set at P < .05. All analyses were conducted using 
STATA, version 13.0 (Stata Corp).32
Results
Amongthe1 547 189meninthiscohort, 93 035(6.0%) were subsequently diagnosed with 
hypertension in 39.7 million person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up, 25.7 years). The 
median age of participants at the end of follow-up was 46.0 years (mean [SD], 45.6 [9.3] 
years; range, 19.0–62.0 years). The median age of participants at hypertension diagnosis was 
49.8 years (mean [SD], 48.5 [7.5] years; range, 18.0–62.0 years). The median BMI among 
men diagnosed with hypertension was 21.4 (mean [SD], 22.3 [3.4]; range, 15.6–40.6) and 
was 21.1 (mean [SD], 21.6 [2.8]; range 15.6–37.5) among those not diagnosed with 
hypertension. Median aerobic capacity among men diagnosed with hypertension was 231.8 
W (mean [SD], 239.2 [46.7] W; range, 110.8–421.0 W) and was 264.0 W (mean [SD], 268.7 
[54.4] W; range, 114.9–455.0 W) among those not diagnosed with hypertension. Median 
muscular strength among men diagnosed with hypertension was 2000 N (mean [SD], 2036 
[341] N; range, 608–3220 N) and was 2020 N (mean [SD], 1982 [459] N; range, 425–3197 
N) among those not diagnosed with hypertension.
Main Effects of Aerobic Capacity, Muscular Strength, and BMI
Low aerobic capacity was associated with a subsequent increased risk of hypertension, after 
adjusting for BMI and other potential confounders (IRR for lowest vs highest tertile, 1.50; 
95% CI, 1.47–1.54; P < .001), including an inverse trend across the full range of aerobic 
capacity (IRR for trend test per 100 W, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69–0.71; P < .001) (Table 1) . 
Muscular strength was slightly positively associated with risk of hypertension (IRR for trend 
test per 1000 N, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00–1.04; P = .02).
High BMI was a significant risk factor for hypertension. Overweight or obese men (≥85th 
percentile on the CDC’s 2000 sex-specific growth chart of BMI for age) had a 2.5-fold risk

 of hypertension relative to those with normal BMI, after adjusting for potential confounders 
(IRR, 2.51; 95% CI, 2.46–2.55; P < .001) (Table 1). When both height and weight were 
included in the model as an alternative to BMI, low height and high weight were each 
independently associated with increased hypertension risk (Table 1), although high weight 
was a much stronger risk factor (P < .001 for heterogeneity).
A first-degree family history of hypertension was associated with a 1.5-fold risk of 
hypertension, after adjusting for BMI and other potential confounders (IRR, 1.54; 95% CI, 
1.52–1.56; P < .001) (Table 1). Educational level and neighborhood SES were inversely 
associated with hypertension risk (ie, high educational level and high neighborhood SES 
were modestly protective) (P < .001 for trend) (Table 1). There was no evidence of 
statistical or biologically meaningful interaction between neighborhood SES and other 
variables in association with hypertension risk (P > .05 for each). In sensitivity analyses that 
were restricted to individuals with no missing data, all risk estimates were similar to the 
main results.
Interactions Among Aerobic Capacity, Muscular Strength, and BMI
The interactive effects of aerobic capacity and BMI on the risk of hypertension are shown in 
Table 2. Low aerobic capacity was associated with increased risk of hypertension even 
among men with normal BMI (IRR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.58–1.67; P < .001). The combination 
of low aerobic capacity and high BMI was associated with highest risk of hypertension, 
which was approximately 3.5-fold higher relative to the reference group of men with high 
aerobic capacity and normal BMI (IRR, 3.53; 95% CI, 3.41–3.66; P < .001). Low aerobic 
capacity and high BMI had a significant negative interaction on both the additive and 
multiplicative scale (P < .001) (ie, the combined effect of these factors was less than the sum 
or product of their separate effects). The Figure shows the probability of hypertension for 
the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of aerobic capacity across the full distribution of BMI, 
from the fully adjusted model.
In contrast, muscular strength had little effect on the risk of hypertension, regardless of BMI 
(eTable 1 in the Supplement) or aerobic capacity (eTable 2 in the Supplement). We found no 
interactions between muscular strength and BMI in association with the risk of hypertension 
on either the additive (P = .89) or multiplicative (P = .56) scale (eTable 1 in the 
Supplement). There was a modestly positive additive interaction between low muscular 
strength and low aerobic capacity (P = .001), suggesting that low aerobic capacity accounted 
for more cases of hypertension among men with low muscular strength than among those 
with high muscular strength (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this large national cohort study, we found that high BMI and low aerobic capacity (but 
not muscular strength) in late adolescence were independently associated with a higher risk 
of hypertension in adulthood, after adjusting for family history and socioeconomic factors. 
Second, these factors had important joint effects: a combination of low aerobic capacity and 
high BMI was associated with the highest risk of hypertension, which was 3.5-fold higher 
than that of men with high aerobic capacity and normal BMI, but these factors had a

 negative interaction. Third, although high BMI was a significant risk factor for hypertension, 
low aerobic capacity also was a significant risk factor among men with normal BMI. If these 
associations are causal, they suggest that preventive interventions should begin early in life 
and include both weight control and aerobic fitness, even among those with normal BMI.
To our knowledge, this large cohort study is the first to examine not only the independent 
and combined effects of physical fitness and BMI on risk of hypertension but also potential 
multiplicative and additive interactions. A better understanding of the interactive effects of 
these common modifiable factors can help inform preventive interventions in susceptible 
subgroups. Additive interactions are often unexamined despite being more informative about 
the effect on public health.33,34 Previous studies have reported similar main effects for 
aerobic fitness9,13,16 or BMI7–11 in association with hypertension, without examining their 
interactions. Studies of self-reported physical activity (rather than objectively measured 
physical fitness) found that higher levels of physical activity in adulthood can partially offset 
the increased risks of hypertension associated with obesity.10,11 In addition, other evidence 
has suggested that aerobic fitness is protective against cardiovascular disease overall and 
more predictive of risk of cardiovascular disease than is physical activity.35–37 We found 
that the combination of low aerobic capacity and high BMI in late adolescence was 
associated with the highest risk of hypertension in adulthood, although these factors had a 
negative additive and multiplicative interaction (ie, their combined effect was less than the 
sum or product of their separate effects).
This study provides evidence that BMI and fitness level are important factors affecting the 
long-term risk of hypertension. The risk estimate that we observed for BMI (a 2.5-fold risk 
of hypertension among overweight or obese men) is consistent overall with previous 
estimates.7–11 Our findings indicate that obesity has a stronger influence than physical 
fitness on hypertension risk. However, low aerobic capacity is also a strong risk factor 
among those with normal BMI. This finding suggests that better aerobic fitness early in life 
may have long-term health benefits even among those who are not overweight or obese. 
Evidence from other studies also suggests that aerobic fitness is associated with better 
cardiovascular disease prognosis and lower mortality, independent of obesity.38
In contrast, we found that after adjusting for BMI, muscular strength had only a very weak 
(positive) association with the risk of hypertension. However, other studies have found that 
high muscular strength is associated with better outcomes in adults either with or without 
hypertension. A US cohort study of 1506 adult men with hypertension reported that high 
muscular strength was associated with lower all-cause mortality, independent of aerobic 
fitness, during a mean of 18 years of follow-up (hazard ratio for highest vs lowest tertile of 
muscular strength, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45–0.98).39 Other studies also have reported that high 
muscular strength is associated with lower all-cause mortality in healthy adult men.40,41
Strengths of this study include its large national cohort design with prospective 
ascertainment of aerobic capacity, muscular strength, BMI, and hypertension. The national 
cohort design prevented selection bias, and the use of registry data with prospectively 
measured exposures prevented bias that may result from self-reporting. We examined well-
validated, objective measures of aerobic capacity and muscular strength, which are likely

 better indicators of habitual physical activity than is self-reported activity.18 We were able to 
adjust for several other important risk factors for hypertension, including family history and 
individual and neighborhood-level socioeconomic factors, which also were prospectively 
ascertained and not self-reported.
Limitations of our study include measurement of physical fitness and BMI at only one age 
(18 years), which prevented us from examining changes in these factors over time. We 
lacked other measures of adiposity, such as waist circumference, as well as information on 
dietary factors that may potentially modify associations between physical fitness or BMI and 
hypertension. Although data on smoking were unavailable, aerobic capacity (maximal 
oxygen uptake) has been reported to be only 7% lower in 18-year-old male smokers 
compared with nonsmokers42; thus, smoking is unlikely to account for more than a small 
proportion of our observed association between aerobic capacity and the risk of 
hypertension. Because this study was based on Swedish military conscripts, the cohort 
consisted entirely of men. However, other studies have reported similar main effects for high 
BMI10,11 or low physical fitness9,13,16 in association with hypertension among women. 
Outpatient diagnoses in our study were available only from specialty clinics starting in 2001; 
hence, hypertension was under- reported. Furthermore, there were changes in diagnostic 
criteria during the study period. However, such underreporting and diagnostic changes are 
expected to be nondifferential with respect to physical fitness or BMI level and, therefore, 
are expected to influence our results conservatively (ie, toward the null hypothesis). Last, 
this study cohort was relatively young, with a median age of 46 years (maximum of 62 
years) at the end of follow-up. Additional follow-up will be needed to examine these 
associations at older ages when hypertension is more common.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this large national cohort study is the first to examine interactions 
between physical fitness and BMI in late adolescence in association with hypertension risk 
in adulthood. We found that high BMI and low aerobic capacity in late adolescence were 
independently associated with higher risk of hypertension in adulthood and had a negative 
interaction. Low aerobic capacity was a significant risk factor even among men with normal 
BMI. If confirmed, these findings suggest that interventions to prevent hypertension should 
begin early in life and include not only weight control but also aerobic fitness, even among 
those with a normal BMI.

bAdjusted for year of the military conscription examination, aerobic capacity, muscular strength, BMI, family history of hypertension, educational level, and neighborhood SES. Height and weight were 
modeled simultaneously as an alternative to BMI in a separate model.
cBMI was categorized using definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years: overweight or obese is defined as the 85th percentile or higher 
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2000 sex-specific growth charts for BMI for age, which corresponds to a BMI of 25.6 or more for 18-year-old men.
