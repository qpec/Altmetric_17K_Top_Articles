IMPORTANCE Diacetylmorphine hydrochloride (the active ingredient in heroin), delivered
under supervision, is effective for the treatment of severe opioid use disorder. However,
owing to political and regulatory barriers, it is not available in many settings around the world,
which limits the options for many long-term street opioid injectors not attracted into or
retained in available treatments.
OBJECTIVE To test if injectable hydromorphone hydrochloride is noninferior to injectable
diacetylmorphine in reducing illicit heroin use for chronic injection opioid users after
6 months of intervention.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Study to Assess Longer-term Opioid Medication
Effectiveness (SALOME) was a phase 3, double-blind, noninferiority trial. The study
randomized 202 long-term street opioid injectors in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
Eligible participants were recruited between December 19, 2011, and December 18, 2013.
Both intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were conducted.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to receive injectable diacetylmorphine
or hydromorphone (up to 3 times daily) for 6 months under supervision.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary and coprimary efficacy outcomes were
self-reported days of street heroin use (primary), days of any street-acquired opioids in the
prior 30 days (noninferiority margin, 4 days), and the proportion of urinalyses positive for
street heroin markers (margin, 10% of the observed rate in the diacetylmorphine group). The
mean differences between diacetylmorphine and hydromorphone for the ITT and PP
analyses were reported.
RESULTS The study included 202 participants; 100 randomized to receive hydromorphone
and 102 to diacetylmorphine. Their mean (SD) age was 44.33 (9.63) years, and 30.7% (62 of
202) were women. Noninferiority of hydromorphone was confirmed in the PP analysis (−1.44;
90% CI, −3.22 to 0.27) for street heroin use, although the margin of 4 days was not excluded
in the ITT analysis (−2.34; 90% CI, −4.14 to −0.52). Noninferiority was confirmed for any
street opioids in the ITT analysis (−0.85; 90% CI, −2.97 to 1.25) and the PP analysis (−0.15;
90% CI, −2.09 to 1.76), as well as for the urinalyses (0.09; 90% CI, −0.02 to 0.19 for the ITT
analysis and 0.13; 90% CI, 0.02-0.24 for the PP analysis). There were 29 SAEs considered to
have some relationship with the injection medication, 5 in the hydromorphone group and 24
in the diacetylmorphine group (rate ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.69). Seizures and overdoses
accounted for 25 of the 29 related SAEs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides evidence to suggest noninferiority of
injectable hydromorphone relative to diacetylmorphine for long-term opioid dependence. In
jurisdictions where diacetylmorphine is currently not available or for patients in whom it is
contraindicated or unsuccessful, hydromorphone could be offered as an alternative.

ependence on opioids, including heroin, continues to
exact a heavy toll on people and communities around
theworld.Oralmaintenancetreatment,suchasmetha-
done hydrochloride and buprenorphine hydrochloride, has
been shown to be effective for many affected individuals, in-
creasing patient retention and decreasing drug use, infec-
tious disease transmission, and illegal activity.1,2 However, in
contextswhereoralmaintenancetreatmentisavailable,anim-
portant minority of individuals with severe opioid use disor-
derarenotattractedintoorretainedinsuchtreatments,sothat
alternative approaches are urgently required.3,4
For this subgroup, 6 randomized trials have now shown
that injectable diacetylmorphine hydrochloride (the active in-
gredient in heroin), delivered under supervision, is both more
clinically effective5-11 and cost-effective12,13 than oral metha-
done. The Cochrane Collaboration has confirmed the superi-
ority of diacetylmorphine in this subpopulation.14 Super-
vised, medically prescribed diacetylmorphine is now being
used with success in a number of countries in Europe (eg, Ger-
many, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark), where it
accounts for approximately 5% to 8% of all those enrolled in
substitution treatments.4 However, there are many countries
around the world where diacetylmorphine is not available ow-
ing to regulatory or political reasons,15 which limits the inter-
ventions available and thus access to care for many individu-
als with long-term use of street opioid injection not effectively
reached by current approaches.
In the prior Canadian trial,7 our group randomized a small
number of participants to receive injectable hydromorphone
hydrochloride (a medication licensed for analgesia but not opi-
oid maintenance) instead of diacetylmorphine on a double-
blind basis to test for heroin metabolites in urine. Surpris-
ingly, these participants were unable to detect that they were
receiving hydromorphone. Moreover, hydromorphone ap-
peared as effective as diacetylmorphine, although the study
was not powered to test this hypothesis.16 These findings sug-
gest that hydromorphone may offer the same benefits as di-
acetylmorphine, an intervention that has been demonstrated
to be effective but is currently denied to patients owing to po-
litical and regulatory barriers in many settings. While nonin-
feriority trials pose methodological challenges, they are de-
signed to test treatments that offer ancillary advantages over
those that have shown to be effective in previous superiority
investigations.17TheStudytoAssessLonger-termOpioidMedi-
cation Effectiveness (SALOME) was designed to test whether
injectable hydromorphone is noninferior to injectable diace-
tylmorphine for long-term opioid dependence.
Methods
Participants and Setting
Eligibleparticipants,recruitedbetweenDecember19,2011,and
December 18, 2013, were men and women 19 years and older
withlong-termopioiddependence18andresidinginthegreater
Vancouver area, British Columbia, Canada. Screening proce-
dures and baseline characteristics have been published
previously19,20 (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1).

(eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).
Oversight
The study was conducted in Vancouver. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent before administration of any
medication or data collection. The SALOME followed good
clinical practice guidelines and was approved by the Provi-
denceHealthCare/UniversityofBritishColumbiaResearchEth-
ics Board. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board
advised the investigators on patient safety and trial conduct
based on masked data (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 1).
Randomization
Variable block size randomization was used with prepared
tables from the Data Centre at St Paul’
s Hospital in Vancou-
ver. Only the study pharmacists (including one of us [A.J.])
could see participants’intervention assignment to prepare the
medications.Randomizationwasstratifiedbysex,andcouples

Key Points
Question Is injectable hydromorphone hydrochloride as effective
as injectable diacetylmorphine hydrochloride (ie, pharmaceutical
heroin) for the treatment of long-term severe opioid use disorder?
Findings In this 6-month randomized clinical trial of injectable
hydromorphone relative to diacetylmorphine, noninferiority was
demonstrated for days of street heroin use in the per-protocol
analysis but not in the intent-to-treat analysis. Noninferiority was
also demonstrated for total days of any street opioid use in both
analyses and hydromorphone had significantly fewer related
adverse events.
Meaning In jurisdictions where diacetylmorphine is currently
unavailable or in patients in whom it is contraindicated or
unsuccessful, hydromorphone could be offered as an alternative.

3 doses per day, up to 400 mg per dose, and up to 1000 mg
per day. Intravenous injection was only allowed in the upper
extremities. Intramuscular injections were also allowed in
thighs and gluteals. At any time, in consultation with the
study physician (S.M. and other nonauthors), participants
could add oral methadone to their care (eAppendix 4 in
Supplement 1). Participants had access to registered nurses,
addiction counselors, social workers, physicians, and allied
health professionals on site.
Outcome Measures
Assessmentsandresearchurinesampleswereobtainedatbase-
line (before randomization and allocation to study medica-
tions) and at 3 and 6 months. Questionnaires were adminis-
tered by experienced members of the research team (K.M. and
K.L.), who operated independently of the clinical team (S.M.
and other nonauthors) at a separate site.19 The clinical team
did not have access to any research data (eAppendix 5 in
Supplement 1).
The primary outcome measure was street heroin use, de-
finedasthenumberofdaysofuseintheprior30daysbymeans
ofself-report,inkeepingwithprevioustrials.6-8Coprimaryout-
comes were the number of days of using any street-acquired
opioids (including heroin) in the prior 30 days and the pro-
portion of urinalyses positive for street heroin markers in the
urine sample provided at the 6-month assessment. Second-
ary outcomes included the proportion of participants receiv-
ing injectable medications at least 28 days in the prior 30 days
(based on clinical records), physical and mental health symp-
toms based on the Maudsley Addiction Profile,23 and self-
reported number of days involved in illegal activities and of
crack cocaine use. To test the success of the masking, partici-
pants were asked which medication they thought they had
been receiving, allowing for one of 5 choices (definitely or pos-
sibly for each medication and unsure).
Urine specimens were collected from participants at each
research visit. Samples were analyzed for the detection of the
following opioid alkaloid impurities present in illicit but not
pharmaceutical heroin: papaverine hydrochloride, noscap-
ine, acetylcodeine, desmethylmeconine, desmethylpapaver-
ine,anddidesmethylpapaverine24(eAppendix6inSupplement
1).Allstudyparticipantswereassessedforadverseevents(AEs),
drug reactions, or changes in health status during each visit
to the clinic by trained registered nurses (eAppendix 7 in
Supplement 1).
Statistical Analysis
The effect of injectable diacetylmorphine on street heroin use
has been remarkably consistent in trials testing efficacy to
date.5-8 To derive the noninferiority margin Δ, we conducted
a Delphi process in which investigators of the main European
trials5,8-11 were asked what margin they would tolerate to ac-
cept hydromorphone as noninferior to diacetylmorphine.
Based on their consensus, Δ was set at 4 days for both heroin
use and total use of any street-acquired opioids. Noninferior-
ity was assessed by the CI comparison approach and deter-
mined by examining the CI around the difference between di-
acetylmorphineandhydromorphone.Ifthelowerboundofthe
1-tailed 95% CI (ie, 100[1 − α]%), corresponding to a 2-tailed
90% CI (ie, 100[1 − 2α]%), excluded the margin (4 days), non-
inferiority was concluded, with a significance level of .05. For
the proportion of urinalyses positive for street heroin mark-
ers, a margin of 10% of the observed rate in the diacetylmor-
phine group was used based on a recent noninferiority study25
testing treatment with morphine for opioid dependence. Sec-
ondary outcomes and differences between groups are de-
scribed using the means (95% CIs).
For those outcomes that were also measured at baseline,
analysis of covariance was used to adjust for baseline values
(eAppendix 8 in Supplement 1). All statistical analyses were
performed using a software program (SAS, version 9.4; SAS
Institute Inc).
Outcome data are given for intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-
protocol (PP) analyses. Because participants were allowed to
reinitiate study medications at any time during the 6-month
period, the PP population was defined as those receiving
injectable medications at least 20 days in the month before
the 6-month assessment. The ITT analysis includes all ran-
domized participants, regardless of retention in treatment.
While ITT is clearly preferred in superiority trials, in the con-
text of noninferiority trials, it increases the likelihood of
falsely concluding noninferiority when such a conclusion is
not justified. For this reason, regulators have put greater
emphasis in the past on PP analyses in noninferiority trials,
although other researchers have suggested that both are
required.17,26 Missing values were imputed using multiple
imputation, except when data were missing owing to death
(2 participants), thus avoiding assigning a score to a
deceased participant27 (see eAppendix 4 in Supplement 1 for
the sensitivity analysis).
Successofthemaskingwasmeasuredusingtheblindingin-
dexbyJamesetal,28whichissensitivetothedegreeofdisagree-
ment between randomization arm and guesses of allocation to
study medications. This index ranges from 0 to 1, representing
completelycorrectandincorrectguessing,respectively,with0.5
representing complete random guessing.
The AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) were compared between
the intervention groups as binary outcomes (ie, having ≥1
event) and continuous outcomes (ie, number of events). For
binary outcomes, relative risks and 95% CIs were calculated.
For continuous outcomes, event rate ratios and 95% CIs were
estimated by the negative binomial regression model to ac-
count for overdispersion.

respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar between

heroin and other street-acquired opioids for many years, in-
dividuals who are currently engaged in illicit activities with
daily use of street opioids, and individuals who had multiple

Masking
In the hydromorphone group, 48 of 99 (48.5%) participants
thoughtthattheywerereceivingdiacetylmorphineorwereun-
sure. In the diacetylmorphine group, 63 of 98 (64.3%) partici-

CI, 0.50-0.63), indicating successful masking, with a re-
sponse pattern close to that expected by random guessing.
Efficacy Variables
Figure 2 shows primary efficacy results for the 2-sided 90%
CI. With respect to total days of street heroin use, the mean
differences between groups (diacetylmorphine minus hydro-
morphone), adjusted by baseline values, were −2.34 (90% CI,
−4.14 to −0.52) in the ITT analysis and −1.44 (90% CI, −3.22 to

participants receiving treatment with injectables �20 days in the prior month
of the main outcome assessment [the 6-month visit]). Street opioid use
includes illicit use of heroin, morphine, hydromorphone, and speedball
(combined street opioids and stimulants). The CI comparison approach is used,
in which noninferiority was concluded when the lower bound of the 2-sided
90% CI (corresponding to a 1-sided 95% CI) lies within the noninferiority zone,
represented by the shaded area that is defined by the margin. For days of street
heroin and opioid use, the margin was −4 days. For the proportion of urinalyses
positive for street heroin markers, the margin was −10% of the value for
diacetylmorphine (ie, −0.03 for ITT and −0.032 for PP). For days of street heroin
and opioid use, baseline values were adjusted.

the diacetylmorphine group (Table 3). An unadjusted rate
ratio comparing the rate of related AEs and an unadjusted
relative risk comparing the presence of related AEs showed
that the hydromorphone group had a significantly lower risk
compared with the diacetylmorphine group (rate ratio, 0.60;
95% CI, 0.39-0.90 and relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49-0.77,
respectively). Regarding drowsiness, there was a signifi-
cantly protective rate ratio of 0.24 (95% CI, 0.14-0.43) in the
hydromorphone group relative to the diacetylmorphine
group.
There were 29 SAEs considered to have some relation-
ship with the injection medication, 5 in the hydromorphone
group and 24 in the diacetylmorphine group (rate ratio, 0.21;
95% CI, 0.06-0.69) (Table 3). Seizures and overdoses
accounted for 25 of the 29 related SAEs: there were 3 over-
doses in the hydromorphone group compared with 11 over-
doses in the diacetylmorphine group (rate ratio, 0.28; 95%
CI, 0.07-1.17). All 11 seizures occurred in 4 participants in the
diacetylmorphine group. Two participants died during the
study period, and neither death was related to the study
treatment.
Discussion
Although the primary outcome did not show noninferiority
in the ITT analysis, noninferiority was demonstrated in the
PP analysis and in both PP and ITT analyses of the coprimary
outcomes. The observed treatment effect of injectable diace-
tylmorphine was consistent with prior clinical trials that
have reported use of street heroin at 6 months approxi-
mately 3 to 5 days in the prior 30 days.6-8 Also, treatment

retention was as high (>80%) as in previous studies3,14 inves-
tigating diacetylmorphine and virtually identical between
groups, and secondary outcomes did not differ between
groups as well. Taken together, these results suggest that
injectable hydromorphone is as effective as injectable diace-
tylmorphine for long-term injection street opioid users not
currently benefiting from available treatments.
The AEs that occurred in this trial were expected accord-
ing to the profile of the study medications and the injectable
route of administration. However, there were some differ-
ences between intervention groups in the rate and presence
of AEs and SAEs, independent of diacetylmorphine dose
equivalency and total number of injections (both of which
were similar between groups). Overall, there were fewer
related AEs and SAEs in the hydromorphone group than in
the diacetylmorphine group. The 2 most common SAEs
related to the study medications were opioid overdoses and
seizures, with no seizures reported in the hydromorphone
arm. Prior investigations have reported an association
between hydromorphone use and seizures among patients
receiving palliative care.29 However, differences in study
populations and the finding that all seizures occurred in a
small number of participants receiving diacetylmorphine
(n = 4) precludes us from drawing conclusions about the
safety profile of hydromorphone regarding seizures. There
were also significantly fewer reports of drowsiness and over-
doses with hydromorphone compared with diacetylmor-
phine. While studies30-32 indicate that hydromorphone
might have similar analgesic effects as other opioids, there
are minor and inconsistent differences regarding AEs. It has
been proposed that the manner in which hydromorphone is
metabolized is an important differentiating characteristic of
this opioid.33 At any rate, it is well established that opioid
use presents important interindividual variability among
patients.34 This variation reinforces the need to provide a
patient-centered approach that offers a choice of opioids, as
is the standard of practice in other clinical areas, such as pal-
liative care.34
Noninferiority trials are conducted on the tacit assump-
tionthatthenewtreatmentwouldexhibitefficacyinaplacebo-
controlled trial if such a trial was to be conducted. Interven-
tion with injectable diacetylmorphine has been shown to be
effective for the small subgroup of opioid-dependent indi-
vidualswhoarenotbenefitingsufficientlyfromavailablethera-
pies and continue injecting street opioids.3 The results of the
present study suggest that hydromorphone is as safe and ef-
fective as diacetylmorphine for this subgroup. Owing to the
noninferiority nature of the study, we can only assume that
hydromorphone would exhibit the same effectiveness as di-
acetylmorphine compared with oral methadone if it would
have been tested in a superiority study.17 It is important to note
thatinthepresentstudyhydromorphoneprovidedsimilarben-
efits to diacetylmorphine and that diacetylmorphine pro-
vided benefits similar to those achieved in trials where it was
demonstrated to be superior to methadone maintenance for
long-term injection street opioid users not currently benefit-
ing from available treatments. Therefore, our findings sug-
gest that hydromorphone is as effective as diacetylmorphine
and, as a licensed analgesic, offers a clear ancillary advantage
injurisdictionsthatwouldpermititsuseformaintenancetreat-
ment. Both of these attributes are required to establish
noninferiority.17
Our study had some limitations. The choice of a margin
poses a well-known challenge in noninferiority trials.26,35 In
such trials, one tests whether an experimental intervention
offering some advantage (eg, lower cost, lower toxicity, or
less invasive) is not unacceptably less effective than the ref-
erence intervention. The margin is meant to represent the
limit of lowered effectiveness in order for the experimental
intervention to be used in place of the reference interven-
tion. A limitation of this trial is that the margin of 4 days
was set by clinicians with experience in countries where
diacetylmorphine has been incorporated into the addiction
treatment system. As such, this margin may have been con-
servative (too small). As noted earlier, in many countries the
reference intervention (diacetylmorphine) is not presently
available for political or regulatory reasons. In those set-
tings, the experimental intervention (hydromorphone) has a
significant advantage as a currently accessible medication.
While hydromorphone is currently licensed for analgesia
and not yet for opioid maintenance, this barrier is not insur-
mountable. Therefore, a larger margin might be deemed
acceptable in such settings. As such, clinicians and decision
makers should interpret the present results in the context of
their own jurisdictions.
Two efficacy outcomes were based on self-report of
street heroin use and total use of street-acquired opioids in
the prior 30 days. Reliability of self-reported street drug use
has been demonstrated when interviews are conducted by
people with no control or power over treatment decisions,36
as in the present study. In addition, noninferiority was con-
firmed by urinalysis, which we recognize was a single
sample. Urine collections at more frequent intervals would
have provided more comprehensive data concerning street
heroin markers. By necessity, this trial was double-blinded
to compare treatment outcomes without expectation bias.
Therefore, each participant knew that his or her chance of
receiving diacetylmorphine was 50%. For the use of hydro-
morphone to be effective in real-world circumstances, it
must be able to attract and retain patients alone on an open-
label basis. However, given the success of the masking and
the overall equal effectiveness of the study medications,
this requirement seems unlikely to be a significant obstacle
for most patients, particularly where diacetylmorphine is
not available.
Conclusions
The results of our study suggest that hydromorphone is as ef-
fective as diacetylmorphine for this subgroup of individuals
with severe opioid use disorder. In jurisdictions where diace-
tylmorphine is currently not available or in patients in whom
it is contraindicated or unsuccessful, hydromorphone pro-
vides a licensed alternative, once its use for maintenance treat-
ment of opioid use disorder is permitted.
