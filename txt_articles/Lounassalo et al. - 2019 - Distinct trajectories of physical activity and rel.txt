Abstract
Background: In recent years, researchers have begun applying a trajectory approach to identify homogeneous
subgroups of physical activity (PA) in heterogeneous populations. This study systematically reviewed the articles
identifying longitudinal PA trajectory classes and the related factors (e.g., determinants, predictors, and outcomes) in
the general population during different life phases.
Methods: The included studies used finite mixture models for identifying trajectories of PA, exercise, or sport
participation. Three electronic databases, PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, and CINAHL, were searched from the
year 2000 to 13 February 2018. The study was conducted according to the PRISMA recommendations.
Results: Twenty-seven articles were included and organized into three age group: youngest (eleven articles),
middle (eight articles), and oldest (eight articles). The youngest group consisted mainly of youth, the middle group
of adults and the oldest group of late middle-aged and older adults. Most commonly, three or four trajectory
classes were reported. Several trajectories describing a decline in PA were reported, especially in the youngest
group, whereas trajectories of consistently increasing PA were observed in the middle and oldest group. While the
proportion of persistently physically inactive individuals increased with age, the proportion was relatively high at all
ages. Generally, male gender, being Caucasian, non-smoking, having low television viewing time, higher
socioeconomic status, no chronic illnesses, and family support for PA were associated either with persistent or
increasing PA.
Conclusions: The reviewed articles identified various PA subgroups, indicating that finite mixture modeling can
yield new information on the complexity of PA behavior compared to studying population mean PA level only. The
studies also provided novel information how different factors relate to changes in PA during life course. The
recognition of the PA subgroups and their determinants is important for the more precise targeting of PA
promotion and PA interventions.

 Background
Up to four-fifths of adolescents and one-third of adults do
not meet the public health physical activity (PA) recom-
mendations [1]. The high prevalence of physical inactivity
imposes a substantial economic burden on health care re-
sources [2, 3]. For these reasons, the promotion of PA
should be a standalone public health priority [4]. Studying
PA behavior and its correlates longitudinally can help bet-
ter understand how PA develops and why during the life
course.
Previous research has established that overall PA de-
creases with age and is lower among women [1, 5].
Longitudinal data show that an individual’s earlier PA
predicts similar PA behavior in the future [6–8], and
that PA tracks at low to moderate levels from child-
hood to adulthood [9]. While tracking shows whether
individuals maintain their PA ranking in the study
population over time [10], it does not necessarily ad-
dress the issue of whether they maintain their PA
level. As for trajectory approach, it allows study of the
development of behavior (e.g., PA level) over time [11,
12]. A trajectory describes the development (stability
or change) in an individual’s behavior over a relatively
long period [11, 13]. Whereas change in time is trad-
itionally studied with two measurement points, trajec-
tory studies use multiple measurement points enabling
the study of linear as well as curvilinear change in
time [14]. This means that the longitudinal nature of
the data can be exploited more thoroughly, and the
variation in the magnitude, rate and timing of possible
change can be studied more precisely.
While standard growth curve modeling has been applied
for studying the mean PA trajectory of a population and
how individual variation about that mean relates to pre-
dictors [15–17], not until recent years, the number of
studies identifying distinct PA trajectory classes (i.e., sub-
groups) has increased. In these studies, the target behavior
of individuals in the same trajectory class is expected to be
similar, while it differs from that of the individuals in the
other classes [14, 18]. In addition, it is possible to study
how potential predictors, determinants and outcomes re-
late to the distinct trajectories [11, 13, 18, 19]. Identifying
distinct PA trajectories at different phases of life as well as
examining the factors related to the trajectories is import-
ant for planning tailored and well-targeted PA promotion
strategies and interventions – especially for those who are
inactive or at risk of becoming inactive.
Trajectory classes have been identified using various
statistical approaches, such as latent class analyses, la-
tent class growth analyses, growth mixture modeling
and group-based trajectory modeling [11, 12, 18–20].
These are all known as finite mixture modeling
methods [19, 20]. The strength of finite mixture mod-
eling is that rather than assuming the existence of
distinct trajectories in a population, it identifies them
based on the population data [11, 13, 14]. Thus, in fi-
nite mixture models the number of underlying trajec-
tories, their shape, their prevalence in the population
and the assignment of individuals to them are all in-
ferred from the data [12, 20].
However, data on PA trajectories identified in differ-
ent study populations and the factors that explain why
certain individuals follow certain PA trajectories have
not yet been assembled. This paper systematically re-
views the longitudinal studies that have used finite mix-
ture modeling to identify distinctive PA trajectory
classes in the general population at different life phases.
The aim is to provide an overview of the research on
trajectory classes by gathering and categorizing the data
reported on the shapes, proportions and descriptions of
trajectory classes, taking into consideration the age of
the participants. In addition, the review investigates po-
tential factors (e.g., determinants, predictors and out-
comes) associated with specific PA trajectories.
Methods
Protocol and registration
This systematic review was conducted following the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [21], and applying
the PRISMA checklist (Additional file 1: Table S1). The
review protocol was registered with the International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROS-
PERO) and is available from http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/
PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42018088120
(Registration number: 2018: CRD42018088120).
Search strategy and data sources
Since preliminary searches showed that no articles identify-
ing distinct PA trajectories had been published before the
year 2000, the search was conducted from the year 2000 to
13 February 2018. The following databases were systematic-
ally searched: PubMed (Medline), Web of Science, and
CINAHL. To ensure a comprehensive coverage, a wide
range of search terms was used. To be eligible for consider-
ation, articles had to contain a mention of the term trajec-
tory and, for each of the following fields, at least one of the
italicized terms: (a) for PA: physical activity, physical in-
activity, sport, exercise or team participation; (b) for the
study design: longitudinal, cohort, prospective, panel or fol-
low-up; and (c) for distinct trajectory classes: group, cluster,
class, profile, subgroup or classification. For details on the
search strategy, see Additional file 2: Table S2.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To be included in the review, studies had to (a) be lon-
gitudinal in design; (b) report data on children, adoles-
cents, adults or older adults in the general population;
Lounassalo et al. BMC Public Health          (2019) 19:271 
Page 2 of 12
 (c) identify more than one trajectory class with three or
more measurement points for either PA, exercise or
sport participation (SP); (d) use finite mixture modeling
for the identification of trajectories; (e) be published
between the year 2000 and 13 February, 2018; and (f)
be published in English.
As the purpose of the review was to identify studies
specifically using finite mixture modeling, studies
using statistical methods where the number of classes
was decided a priori or methods that assumed the in-
dividuals come from a single population that can be
described and approximated adequately with a single
growth trajectory (e.g., growth curve modeling), were
excluded. Also excluded were studies combining other
variables (e.g., other health behaviors) with PA in the
same trajectory modeling, conference abstracts with-
out existence of published article, and studies confined
to groups with significant co-morbidities (e.g., chronic
illnesses, disabilities or mental health problems) or
that solely concerned pregnant women.
Study selection process
To establish inter-rater reliability, studies were selected
by two authors (IL and KS) independently. First, the ti-
tles and abstracts of candidate articles were screened
for relevance. After a relevant abstract was found, the
full text was assessed for eligibility. Where uncertainties
arose about the inclusion of an article, the other au-
thors (AK, MH, AT, and SP) were consulted.
Data extraction
When available, the following data were extracted
from each article: reference (authors and publication
year), study aims, description of the study (name of
the study, geographical location, study design, year of
the baseline measurement, follow-up time, and num-
ber of measurements), study sample (sample size, dis-
tribution of males and females, and age at baseline),
statistical approach (the finite mixture model used to
identify the trajectory classes, the software used for
the analysis, the criteria used for model comparison,
determining the final number of trajectory classes, and
the goodness of fit of the model), data collection and
PA variables, description of the trajectory classes iden-
tified (the number and names of the trajectory classes
and the proportion of participants in each trajectory
class), factors related to the PA trajectories (predic-
tors, determinants, outcomes, and covariates), and
main findings in relation to trajectory class member-
ship. One author (IL) performed the data extraction,
consulting other authors when needed (MH, AK, KS,
THT, and SP).
Quality assessment
Two authors (IL and MH) independently assessed the
methodological quality of the included studies. Any dis-
agreement or uncertainty was resolved by consulting a
third author (AK). Study quality was assessed by using
modified versions of the Quality Assessment Tool for
Observational
Cohort
and
Cross-Sectional
Studies
(https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/study-quality-as-
sessment-tools) and Guidelines for Reporting on Latent
Trajectory
Studies
(GRoLTS)
-checklist
[22].
The
GRoLTS-checklist is mainly aimed for studies using latent
growth mixture modeling and latent class growth analysis,
but when modified, is usable for all finite mixture models.
The researchers also included some additional criteria for
example, objective vs. self-reported measures of PA,
whether more than one statistical fit measure was used
when deciding the final number of trajectory classes and
whether at least one of the fit measures was the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) or adjusted Bayesian Informa-
tion Criterion (ABIC). These criteria were added in re-
sponse to the recommendation that researchers use more
than one comparison tool for deciding the final number of
trajectory classes and that the BIC or ABIC should be one
of them [22]. The questions chosen for the quality
assessment were aimed to assess attrition bias, perform-
ance bias, selection bias concerning the final number of
trajectory classes chosen, detection bias, and other biases
(e.g., were covariates used).
Each included study was rated in quality from zero to 16.
The study under assessment was marked “yes” when it met
a given quality criterion and “no” when it did not, “NA”
when the criterion was not applicable, and “CA” when
meeting the criterion could not be determined from the in-
formation provided by the study. In addition, if a specific
quality criterion was not mentioned in the assessed study
but reference was made to previous studies where the cri-
terion was mentioned, it was marked “yes”. Studies scored
1 point for each yes and 0 points for each no, “NA” and
“CA”. Study quality was categorized as poor (score ranging
from 0 to 5), fair (6 to 11), or good (12 to 16).
Analyses
To summarize the PA trajectory classes identified in
the general populations studied and the factors explain-
ing these classes, the relevant data were first extracted
from the included articles and a qualitative synthesis,
including tables and figures, was performed. The arti-
cles were organized into groups based on the partici-
pants’ age in each study. Each of the PA trajectories
reported in the studies was subsumed under a PA tra-
jectory category that best described the name and
shape of the trajectory. To illustrate the proportion of
participants within a trajectory class (i.e., class size of
the trajectory) and to compare this to the proportions

 in the other trajectory classes within and between the PA
trajectory categories (p), a forest plot was generated. For
the forest plot, standard errors (SE) and 95% confidence in-
tervals (95% CI) for the class sizes reported in the individual
studies were calculated using the formula SE =
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
pð1−pÞ=n
p
,
where n is the sample size of a study; 95% CI: p ± 1.96 SE.
The forest plot was generated using R version 3.2.2 (pack-
age forestplot). The results could not be combined in a
quantitative synthesis (i.e., meta-analysis) as the inclusion
criteria were based on diverse PA, exercise and SP variables
and the participants were examined at different phases of
life in different studies. The mean age at which PA level
started to decrease among children and adolescents was
calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 24).
Results
Overview of the included studies
The literature search identified 828 articles and an add-
itional study [23] was added through other sources. After
discarding duplicates, 574 potential articles remained.
After screening the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the ar-
ticles independently, the two authors (IL and KS) found
that they had each selected the same 27 articles and two
different articles each that potentially met the inclusion
criteria. Full consensus was reached after discussion and
27 papers were deemed to have fully met the inclusion cri-
teria (Fig. 1; Additional file 3: Table S3). All studies were
published between years 2004 and 2018.
Objectively measured PA was available from three
different research data and was used in six studies [24–
29] while the others used self-reported or parent-re-
ported measures of PA [30–45], exercise [46, 47] and
SP [23, 26, 28, 48, 49] (Additional file 3: Table S3). The
broader term PA trajectories is used to refer to all the
different trajectories of PA, exercise and SP. Specific in-
formation is provided separately for PA and SP only for
the qualitative synthesis of trajectories during child-
hood and adolescence and also in Additional file 4.
The number of PA trajectory classes identified in
each study ranged from one to five, and was most
commonly either four [23, 24, 26–28, 31, 36, 37, 39–
41, 46] or three [24–26, 28, 29, 33–35, 42–45, 48, 49]
(Additional file 3: Table S3). Eight studies identified
separate trajectories for males and females [24, 25, 38,
43, 44, 46, 48, 49], twelve studied males and females
together in the same trajectories [23, 26–28, 30–32,
36, 40–42, 45], five studied females only [29, 35, 37,
39, 47], and two studied males only [33, 34].
Overview of study quality and risk of bias
The quality assessment results are shown in detail as sup-
plementary material (Additional file 5: Table S4). Initial
agreement on study quality between the two raters (IL and
MH) was 90%, and full consensus was reached after discus-
sion. Study quality scores ranged from 9/16 to 15/16
(mean = 12). None of the 27 studies were rated as of poor
quality, 11/27 were rated as fair (scores 9: n = 3 [43, 44,
48]; 10: n = 3 [34, 37, 46]; 11: n = 5 [24, 25, 31, 41, 47]), and
16/27 as good (scores 12: n = 3 [38, 40, 45]; 13: n = 2 [23,
32]; 14: n = 3 [36, 42, 49]; 15: n = 8 [26–30, 33, 35, 39]).
Frequent reporting on items from the modified Quality As-
sessment
Tool
for
Observational
Cohort
and
Cross-Sectional Studies was observed [see Additional file 5:
Table S4; questions 1–9]. However, reporting on items
from the modified GRoLTS-checklist was more infrequent:
only ten of the 27 studies reported on all of the six items
selected from the GRoLTS-checklist [see Additional file 5:
Table S4; questions 11–16] while seven studies reported on
just one and three on two items.
Nineteen distinct longitudinal research data were
used in the 27 articles (Additional file 3: Table S3). To
avoid the reporting of duplicated results, the exact
same PA trajectories derived from the same data are
treated as one and the same result instead of as separ-
ate results [26–28, 43, 44]. The potentially different
outcomes, determinants or predictors of all trajectories
are still reported separately for each study. Neverthe-
less, since the review aimed to capture all the different
PA trajectory classes thus far identified in general pop-
ulations, when the shape, class size or the number of
PA trajectories identified differed between studies, they
were treated as separate results, including when derived
from the exact same data.
The age groups and PA trajectory categories derived
from the reviewed studies
The studies were organized into three groups based
on the participant age: youngest, middle, and oldest
(Additional file 3: Table S3; Additional file 4). The
youngest group consisted of children, adolescents and
young adults, while the oldest group consisted of late
middle-aged and older adults. The middle group was
mixed, consisting largely of adults with the study period
initiated in childhood, adolescence or adulthood and, in
some studies, continuing up to old age.
Each PA trajectory reported in the included studies was
classified under a PA trajectory category that best de-
scribed its name, shape, and context (Additional file 4).
The middle and oldest groups were distributed across six
PA trajectory categories: Increaser, Highly active, Active,
Inactive, Decreaser from a moderate PA level, and Decrea-
ser from a low PA level / low-active. In the youngest
group, an additional category, labelled Decreaser from a
high PA level, was detected, and the Increaser category
was replaced with a category labelled From increaser to
decreaser. The purpose of the forest plot (Additional file 4)
is to provide a comprehensive
visualization of the

 prevalence and class sizes of distinct trajectories in general
population at different phases of life. It also summarizes in
one figure the sizes of the study samples and the PA mea-
sures and data collection method used in each study.
PA trajectories in the youngest group
The youngest group contained 11 articles [23–28, 30, 38,
39, 48, 49] (Additional file 3: Table S3). Participants were
aged four to 14 at baseline with the oldest participants
aged 22 at the end of the latest follow-up. Follow-up time
varied from two to 15 years (mean = 9.3 years; median = 8
years) and sample size from 530 to 8978 participants be-
tween studies.
In most studies, the trajectories with the highest propor-
tion of individuals (range 39–100%) were placed in the fol-
lowing
PA
trajectory
categories:
Decreaser
from
a
moderate PA level [24, 28, 39], Active [23, 28, 38, 49] or
Decreaser from a low PA level / low-active [24, 30, 48]
(Additional file 4: c, f, g). Altogether, 53 different PA tra-
jectories were reported in the studies in the youngest

 group (Additional file 4). Persistent PA was described
only in 14 trajectories: 11 in the Active category and
three in the Highly active category (Additional file 4: b,
c). Analysis of the shapes of the distinct trajectory clas-
ses showed that inactivity and low activity were more
persistent behaviors [23, 28, 30, 38, 49] than high or
moderate activity [23–25, 28, 30, 39, 49], meaning that
those following the high or moderate PA trajectories
more often showed change (usually a declining change),
while the inactives remained at the same level.
More than half of the 53 trajectories described a decline
in PA level during childhood and adolescence (Add-
itional file 4: a, e, f, g). In fact, no studies found clear trajec-
tories of continuously increasing PA: even an initially
ascending trajectory was followed by a descent (Add-
itional file 4: a). The declining trend in PA was especially
clear in studies using objectively measured PA, where as
many as 18 of the 21 trajectories described a decline in PA
level [24, 25, 28]. Mean age at the start of the decline was
7.7 years in the studies using objective measures [24, 25,
28] compared to 9.6 years in those using self-reports of PA
[32, 38, 39] or 10.8 years in those using self-reports of SP
[28, 48, 49]. Although decreasing trends were prevalent in
the youngest group, the PA level of the decreasers
from high or moderate PA did not usually fall to the level
of the inactive individuals [24, 30, 38, 48]. However, one
study using objectives measures showed that the 95% CIs
of all the three declining PA trajectory classes overlapped
by the age 17 for girls [25]. Additionally, drop-outs
from SP had lower SP rate in young adulthood than those
who were initially identified in the non-participation tra-
jectories [28, 49].
PA trajectories in the middle group
The middle group comprised 8 studies [29, 32, 40–45]
(Additional file 3: Table 3). Participant age at baseline
ranged from 9 to 90. Two studies using the same data
identified trajectories from childhood to adulthood [32,
42], another two, using different data, identified trajector-
ies from adolescence to adulthood [43, 44], one studied
adults only [45], and the other three studied adults and
older adults [29, 40, 41]. Follow-up time varied from two
to 34 years (mean = 19.8 years; median = 23.5 years), and
sample size from 497 to 3564 participants.
Altogether 28 different middle group PA trajectories
were reported in the studies (Additional file 4). In most
studies, the largest proportions (range 43–86%) of
individuals were in the trajectory classes describing
either persistent PA [42–44], inactivity [40] or low PA
[29, 32, 45] (Additional file 4: c, d, g). Stable PA
trajectories (22 trajectories) were more prevalent than
change (i.e., a decrease or increase in PA level) trajec-
tories (6 trajectories) (Additional file 4). In the middle
group, the one study measuring PA objectively identified
three distinct but stable PA trajectories among women
verifying the observation that PA seems to be stable
behavior in adulthood [29].
Unlike in the youngest group, three trajectory classes in-
dicating a continuous increase in PA level were reported
[32, 40, 41]. One study that identified an increasing PA
trajectory from adolescence to adulthood showed that the
increasers had very similar PA level as the low-active and
inactive participants until the age 12. However, by the age
15 the increasing trajectory began to differ from the low
and inactive trajectories with the increase in PA level con-
tinuing into adulthood [32]. In two studies, the decreasing
PA trajectories did not fall to the level of the inactive tra-
jectories [32, 41] and in one study it did [40].
PA trajectories in the oldest group
Eight studies were placed in the oldest group [31, 33–37,
46, 47] (Additional file 3: Table S3). Age at baseline was
35–55 in one article [31], 40 or older in two articles [33, 47],
50 or older in three articles [35, 36, 46], and 60 or older in
two articles [34, 37]. Follow-up time varied from seven to 20
years (mean = 13.9 years; median = 12.0 years) and sample
size from 433 to 92629 participants.
Altogether 34 different PA trajectories were reported
by the studies in the oldest group (Additional file 4).
While seven out of eight studies identified a trajectory
describing
persistent
PA
(range
14–51%)
(Add-
itional file 4: c), in five studies the highest proportion of
individuals (range 26–72%) were in the inactive (Add-
itional file 4: d) [36, 37, 46] and low-active trajectory
classes (Additional file 4: g) [35, 47]. In addition, the PA
level of those following the decreasing PA trajectories
often fell to the level of those following the inactive tra-
jectories [31, 36, 37, 46]. Some studies detected a declin-
ing trend in PA level with age, not only in one, but in
several trajectory classes [34, 37]. These results show the
prevalence of inactivity in older age and how PA levels
tend to decline with age. Five studies, however, identified
a trajectory class of increasers as well (Additional file 4: a)
[31, 33, 36, 46, 47].
Factors related to the PA trajectories
Most studies also aimed to explore what potential fac-
tors (i.e., predictors, determinants, and outcomes) are as-
sociated
with
specific
PA
trajectories.
The
most
commonly studied factors were socioeconomic status
(SES), family or social support, sociodemographic charac-
teristics, health behaviors, and health-related variables
(Additional file 3: Table S3).
Several studies in all three age groups showed that
either higher education, higher income or higher occu-
pational status was associated with a higher probability
of following an active rather than inactive trajectory
[26, 31–33, 35, 36, 38, 40, 46–48]. Having children was

 associated with decreasing PA in early midlife [32]
while having parental PA support [32] or having a
physically active father was an important factor, espe-
cially in lower SES families, in the adoption of a phys-
ically active lifestyle by a child [26].
Gender differences were observed in PA trajectory
membership: active trajectories were more prevalent
among males than females [24, 25, 28, 31, 38, 40, 46], just
as participation in sport was more frequent among boys
than girls [48, 49]. In contrast, the studies using data from
Finnish cohorts found no marked gender differences in
the membership of the different trajectory classes [43, 44].
Additionally, while Finnish males had higher odds of be-
ing persistently active, they also had higher odds of being
persistently inactive rather than low active when com-
pared to women [32]. Being non-Caucasian was a risk fac-
tor for low PA level [23, 35, 39, 47].
Associations of PA trajectories with other health be-
haviors were studied in all age groups. Current smoking
was associated with decreasing PA, persistently low PA,
or inactivity rather than with persistent PA [23, 30, 32,
33, 35, 47], and smoking cessation with increased levels
of PA [33]. Greater alcohol consumption was associated
with persistent PA [32, 35] and even with increasing PA
[33]. Additionally, consistent PA was associated with de-
creasing television viewing time in adolescence [28, 39].
Older participants with lower fat intake and higher con-
sumption of vegetables and fruits were more likely to follow
a physically active than minimally active trajectory [35].
Over-weight and obesity were associated with low activity
or inactivity among adult women [29] and older adults [33,
35, 37, 47]. A decreasing PA level in childhood [27] and
low SP in adolescence [49] predicted unfavorable changes
in body composition in young adulthood while persistent
PA in childhood and adolescence predicted a better health
profile [49] and greater bone strength [25].
Several different health-related factors were studied, es-
pecially among older adults. Older adults with diagnosed
chronic diseases (e.g., arthritis, arthrosis, bronchitis, cor-
onary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, or high blood pressure) [33, 35, 37, 47], or who had
physical difficulties [47], disabilities [37], depressive symp-
toms [37, 46], or fair or poor self-rated health [37, 46]
were less likely to follow a persistently active trajectory
and more likely to follow a low-active or inactive trajec-
tory. In addition, a low mortality rate [37] and good phys-
ical functioning [47] were associated with persistent PA.
Depressive symptoms were also studied among youth and
younger adults. Boys who dropped out from organized
sport had higher depression scores at age 20 when com-
pared to consistent sport participants [49]. However,
Kaseva et al. found no association between leisure time
PA from childhood to adulthood and the progression of
depressive symptoms in adulthood.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this systematic review is
the first to compile the literature on studies using finite
mixture modeling to identify distinct trajectory classes
of either stable or changing PA, exercise or SP in the
general population during different life phases along
with the examination of the potential factors related to
these trajectories. The number of studies has started to
accumulate: of the 27 included articles, 24 were pub-
lished from 2010 onward. This reflects the novelty and
topicality of the research area. The most common num-
ber of trajectory classes reported was three or four
(Additional file 3: Table S3). The fact that several PA
trajectory classes were identified shows that PA is a be-
havior that does not develop uniformly between indi-
viduals. This is why finite mixture modeling is an
appropriate method for studying PA across the life
course. Various distinct decreasing PA trajectories were
reported among youth, in particular, while among
adults and older adults few studies found increasing PA
trajectories. The results were in agreement with previ-
ous findings showing that the proportion of inactive in-
dividuals is rather high at all ages and that inactivity
tends to increase with age [1]. Various factors explain-
ing the differences in PA level between individuals dur-
ing
the
life
course
were
studied,
the
strongest
associations being found for SES and gender.
Developmental trajectories of PA during the life course
The number of distinct PA trajectories describing change
were more prevalent among youth, while persistently
stable PA trajectory classes were more prevalent in adult-
hood. The inactive trajectories seemed to be more stable
than the trajectories describing activity. These findings
support research showing that low activity and inactivity
track better than activity, and that the stability of tracking
is higher during adulthood than in childhood or during
the transition from childhood to adolescence or from ado-
lescence to adulthood [9]. However, the trajectory studies
reviewed here add to these findings by showing what spe-
cific changes in PA level occur between individuals during
the life course.
All the reviewed studies in the youngest group identified
at least one distinct PA trajectory describing a decrease in
a high, moderate or low level of PA, a curvilinear trajec-
tory describing an increase followed by a decrease in PA
[24, 25, 28, 30, 38, 39], or drop-out from SP [23, 28, 48, 49].
This result is in line with previous findings showing that
childhood [50, 51] and adolescence [52–54] are periods of
life characterized by a decline in PA. Interestingly, the
reviewed
studies
using
objective
measures
of
PA
found that the level of PA had already started to de-
cline at the age of school entry [24, 25, 28] whereas
the studies using self-reported measures of PA found

Page 7 of 12
 the corresponding age to be around 10 years [32, 38, 39].
It should be pointed out that some of the studies using
self-reported measures studied slightly older children than
the studies using objective measures, a factor that could
partially explain this difference. However, regardless of
measurement type, the trajectory studies showed that PA
starts to decline in childhood, and not in adolescence – an
observation also emphasized in other reports based on ob-
jectively measured PA [51, 55]. However, drop-out from
SP might be more common in adolescence than in child-
hood since the age at which the decline began was higher
in the SP than PA trajectories [23, 28, 48, 49].
While no trajectory classes characterized by consist-
ently increasing PA were observed in the youngest
group, such classes were reported in few of the studies
in the middle [32, 40, 41] and oldest [31, 33, 36, 46, 47]
groups. In the oldest group, the participants were youn-
ger in the five studies identifying a trajectory of increas-
ing PA [31, 33, 36, 46, 47] than those in the three
studies reporting no such trajectories [34, 35, 37].
Nguyen et al. [35] found a minimal but significant in-
crease in PA over time in their moderately and highly
active trajectory classes among 50- to 69-year-old
women whereas a slight decrease was observed in PA
in each parameter over time among the oldest partici-
pants (70 years or older). Various explanations have
been offered for this. It has been suggested that adults
increase their PA level due to aging-related health con-
cerns [56, 57] or after retirement [58–60], while overall
PA tends to eventually decline with older age [1], pos-
sibly due to declining health [60]. In most of the
reviewed studies examining older adults [31, 36, 37,
46], those in the declining PA trajectories eventually
approximated to the PA level of those in the inactive
trajectories [31, 36, 37, 46]. At the same time, the de-
clining trajectories usually did not fall to the level of
the inactive trajectories in the studies examining chil-
dren and adolescents [24, 30, 38, 48] or adults [32, 41].
Thus, despite of the common declining tendency of PA
throughout life course, being physically active in child-
hood and adolescence may be of high importance since
it can postpone the time of becoming inactive later on.
Factors related to PA trajectory class membership
Various predictors, determinants, covariates and outcomes
of PA trajectory class membership were studied. Mostly,
these findings further supported other findings that have
shown how: (1) higher SES is associated with PA in youth
[61–63] and in adulthood [55]; (2) having family support
[54, 61], active parents [61, 64], and especially an active
father [63, 65], is associated with PA in childhood; and (3)
males are generally more active than females [1, 54, 56,
64, 66]. One gender-related exception was found in stud-
ies on the Finnish population: leisure time PA was as
common among adult women as among men [32, 43], a
finding that has also been reported in a study not included
in this review [67]. Most of the present results [33, 35, 37,
46, 47, 49] also further supported other findings showing
that lack of PA is a major risk factor for morbidity and
premature mortality [68–70]. However, one reviewed
study found that Caucasian participants in a trajectory la-
beled “exceeding PA guidelines three times” had higher
odds for developing subclinical coronary artery disease by
middle age than those in the trajectory “below PA guide-
lines” [45], suggesting that extremely high doses of leisure
time PA might be a risk factor for cardiovascular health.
Thus, most of the present results specifically sup-
ported other findings on correlates of persistent inactiv-
ity or persistent PA. Apart from studying stable PA
trajectories, finite mixture modeling has the advantage
of detecting changes over time enabling also the study
of factors associated with these changes. The reviewed
[23, 30, 32, 33, 35, 47] and other studies [71, 72] have
found a negative association between regular smoking
and PA with the reviewed studies showing that smoking
cessation [33] and non-smoking [32] were associated
with increasing PA, whereas an increase in smoking
was associated with decreasing PA [30]. While the asso-
ciation between television viewing time and PA has been
found to be negative and rather small [73, 74], the present
trajectory studies add to this finding by suggesting that
persistent PA is associated with decreasing television view-
ing time [28, 39] whereas decreasing PA is associated with
increasing television viewing time [39] in adolescence.
Moreover, alcohol consumption was positively associated
with both increasing [32, 33] and decreasing PA trajector-
ies [32] rather than with persistently low PA. Rovio et al.
[32] also found that having children was associated with
membership of a decreasing PA trajectory, an association
also observed elsewhere [75]. Groups disadvantaged with
respect to education and income were significantly more
likely to be on a decreasing than active trajectory [40],
while high adulthood education was associated with mem-
bership of both increasing and decreasing active trajector-
ies [32]. Special attention should be paid to success at
school and parental PA support in childhood since they
were both associated with membership of a consistently
increasing PA trajectory which began to differ from the in-
active and low-active trajectories after the age of 12 [32].
Limitations
This review also has its limitations that could induce
bias in interpretation of the results. Gathering and com-
paring the findings was challenging due to the hetero-
geneity in study populations, sample sizes, follow-up
duration, measurement times, time between measure-
ments, participants’ age, the names researchers gave to
their trajectories, measurements (PA, exercise, and SP),
Lounassalo et al. BMC Public Health          (2019) 19:271 
Page 8 of 12
 exposures and outcome variables, data organization in
trajectory modeling (i.e., age vs. measurement year), and
the finite mixture models used. For example, if the popu-
lation in one study had lower SES than the populations in
other studies, it could be expected to contain a larger
group of inactive individuals. The length of the follow-up
and the time between measurement points have been
found to affect the number of trajectories identified [22],
for example, a long interval between measurement points
might mean that some PA patterns are not detected. Also,
since the trajectory classes were usually labelled in relation
to the other trajectory classes identified within each study
and not necessarily in relation to PA guidelines, it is pos-
sible, for example, that a PA level reported as high in one
study might be reported as moderate in another study.
Although articles reporting findings based on the
exact same trajectories were omitted, a risk of reporting
partially overlapping results remains when PA trajector-
ies were initially identified by gender and then again for
both sexes combined [25, 28, 36, 46], or when studies
used the same data and variables but diverged over the
final number of trajectory classes [32, 42]. The explan-
ation for the latter case might be that Kaseva et al. [42]
used Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) indices, des-
pite the current recommendation that the BIC and
ABIC are the best model fit measures for determining
the final number of classes compared to, for example,
the AIC or Lo-Mendel-Rubin-likelihood ratio test [22].
There is a possibility for selective bias in the final num-
ber of trajectory classes when the researchers estimated
the shape of the trajectory only up to quadratic shape
in studies having more than three measurement points
[24, 28, 36–39, 41, 42, 48] which would also enable the
estimation of, for example, cubic shape. The possibility
of selective bias also exists when classes containing less
than 5% of the study population were ignored [30, 33].
Other factors relating to bias at the individual study
level are listed point by point in the additional material
(Additional file 5: Table S4).
While finite mixture modeling has its advantages, pre-
sented in the beginning of this review [11, 12, 22], the de-
velopers of the modeling also have recognized the
uncertainties related to these models, and a few studies
have recommended caution when using them [20, 76–78].
For example, the correct assignment of individuals to a
trajectory class cannot be certain, the number of trajectory
classes is not immutable [76], and the choice of the
optimal number of classes is based on various formal and
informal criteria [20]. Thus, while model fit indices (e.g.,
BIC and ABIC) are available for determining the optimal
number of classes, researchers also rely on the share of
cases assigned to the smallest trajectory class, interpret-
ability, and model convergence [19, 20]. The observa-
tions of this review support these comments that no
consensus has not yet been achieved in the use of
statistical approaches for identifying developmental trajec-
tories [20, 78] and that the selected statistical approach
itself may have an effect on the results [20]. The
GRoLTS-checklist has been developed to address these
uncertainties; even so, researchers should be alert to new
developments in this rapidly evolving area [22].
Future studies
Physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for
mortality worldwide [70]. To counter inactivity, future
research should pay special attention to identifying
additional determinants of trajectory class membership
(e.g., social capital, environmental, psychological and
genetic factors, cultural and social norms, global media
and marketing, urbanization, sleeping, dietary behavior,
and other life changes). Special attention should be paid
to those who increase their PA, as it is important to
understand how potential lifelong inactivity could be
reversed to activity. The lack of longitudinal trajectory
studies on the transition from adolescence to adulthood
needs to be addressed to more profoundly. In addition,
more large-scale population-based longitudinal studies
using objective measures for identifying PA trajectory
classes are needed as objectively measured and self-re-
ported PA have shown only modest agreement [79].
Since all the reviewed studies were conducted in
high-income
countries
(in
Europe,
USA,
Canada,
Australia or Taiwan), there is a need to identify PA tra-
jectories in low- and middle-income countries. Finally,
specification of the most suitable statistical model for
identifying PA trajectories would help in collectively
building knowledge in this field. Before this is achieved,
use of the GRoLTS-checklist [22] is recommended in
future trajectory studies using finite mixture modeling
for standardizing the results.
Conclusions
This review supports earlier findings on the general trends
and population means of PA during the life course. How-
ever, studying diverse trajectory classes using finite mixture
modeling also adds to previous knowledge by providing evi-
dence of the heterogeneity of PA. Thus, this review
broadens understanding of the variation that occurs in the
timing, rate and magnitude of PA development during the
life course and the factors relating to membership of spe-
cific trajectory classes. This helps identify the key periods of
life and key groups at which to target PA promotion and
thereby contribute to improving public health. The results
showed that PA begins to decline already in childhood, that
the PA habits stabilize with age and that inactivity is more
persistent than activity. Hence, PA interventions should be
targeted at children early in life before their PA habits be-
come stable. Due to the heterogeneity in samples, finite

 mixture models, exposures and outcome variables used in
the selected studies, and the general reliance on self-
reported PA, the results of this review need to be inter-
preted cautiously.
