study question: Is underage abortion associated with adverse socioeconomic and health outcomes in early adulthood when compared
with underage delivery?
summaryanswer: Underageabortionwasnotfoundtobeassociatedwithmentalhealthproblemsinearlyadulthood,andsocioeconom-
ic outcomes were better among those who experienced abortion compared with those who gave birth.
what is known already: Teenage motherhood has been linked with numerous adverse outcomes in later life, including low educa-
tional levels and poor physical and mental health. Whether abortion at a young age predisposes to similar consequences is not clear.
study design, size, duration: This nationwide, retrospective cohort study from Finland, included all women born in 1987
(n ¼ 29 041) and followed until 2012.
participants/materials, setting, methods: We analysed socioeconomic, psychiatric and risk-taking-related health out-
comes up to 25 years of age after underage (,18 years) abortion (n ¼ 1041, 3.6%) and after childbirth (n ¼ 394, 1.4%). Before and after con-
ception analyses within the study groups were performed to further examine the association between abortion and adverse health outcomes. A
group with no pregnancies up to 20 years of age (n ¼ 25 312, 88.0%) served as an external reference group.
main results and the role of chance: We found no significant differences between the underage abortion and the childbirth
group regarding risks of psychiatric disorders (adjusted odds ratio 0.96 [0.67–1.40]) or suffering from intentional or unintentional poisoning by
medications or drugs (1.06 [0.57–1.98]). Compared with those who gave birth, girls who underwent abortion were less likely to achieve only a
low educational level (0.41 [95% confidence interval 0.31–0.54]) or to be welfare-dependent (0.31 [0.22–0.45]), but more likely to suffer from
injuries (1.51 [1.09–2.10]). Compared with the external control group, both pregnancy groups were disadvantaged already prior to the preg-
nancy. Psychiatric disorders and risk-taking-related health outcomes, including injury, were increased in the abortion group and in the childbirth
group similarly on both sides of the pregnancy.
limitations, reasons for caution: Theretrospectivenatureofthestudyremainsalimitation.Theidentificationofstudysubjects
in order to collect additional data was not allowed for ethical reasons. Therefore further confounding factors, such as the intentionality of the
pregnancy, could not be checked.
wider implications of the findings: Previous studies have found that abortion is not harmful to mental health in the majority of
adult women. Our studyadds to the current understanding in suggesting that this is also the case concerning underage girls. Furthermore, women
with a history of underage abortion had better socioeconomic outcomes compared with those who gave birth. These findings can be generalized
to settings of high-quality social and health-care services, where abortion is accessible and affordable to all citizens. Social and health-care profes-
sionals who care for and counsel underage girls facing unplanned pregnancy should acknowledge this information.

Key words: teenage pregnancy / teenage motherhood / abortion / socioeconomic outcomes / health outcomes
Introduction
A substantial bodyof evidence linksteenage motherhood with disadvan-
tages in educational and economic outcomes, domestic violence, poor
physical and mental health and even premature death when compared
with non-pregnant peers and women who conceive at an older age
(Olausson et al., 2001; Otterblad Olausson et al., 2004; Boden et al.,
2008; Coyne and D’onofrio, 2012; Patel and Sen, 2012). It has been
argued that many of the hardships experienced by teenage mothers
are due to the causes and consequences of untimely pregnancies and
therefore an abortion could mitigate these adverse outcomes (Fergus-
son et al., 2007). On the other hand, the potential psychological harm
associated with experiencing an induced abortion at a young age has
raised worries concerning predisposition to similar consequences.
In the developed world, a large proportion of all teenage pregnancies
end in induced abortion. Among 15- to 19-year-olds, this proportion has
been30%intheUSA,43%intheUK,77%inSwedenand59%inFinlandin
recent years (Kost and Henshaw, 2014; THL, 2014, 2015; ONS, 2015).
Despite such figures, research on the consequences of teenage induced
abortion remains sparse. Higher educational achievement among girls
who terminated their pregnancies compared with those who became
teenage mothers have been reported (Zabin et al., 1989; Fergusson
et al., 2007). The results of studies on possible mental health conse-
quencesofinducedabortionamong teenagersarefewandcontradictory
(Fergussonetal.,2006;Warrenetal.,2010).Risk-taking,definedasaten-
dency to engage in behaviours that have a potential to be harmful, has
been found to be common among girls who conceive at a young age
(Imamura et al., 2007). However, it is not known whether or not an
induced abortion itself is likely to enhance such problematic behaviour.
The objective of our study was to assess whether underage induced
abortion is associated with adverse early adulthood outcomes. We
specifically concentrated on socioeconomic factors, psychiatric disor-
ders and risk-taking-related health outcomes. The 1987 Finnish Birth
Cohort, including all 29 041 girls born within 1 year in Finland, was
used to accomplish this.
Materials and Methods
The 1987 Finnish Birth Cohort is a longitudinal register group, consisting of all
the people born in 1987 in Finland. The original cohort data derived from the
Medical Birth Register (MBR) was linked to data from multiple national regis-
ters using the cohort members’ unique Finnish identity numbers (Paananen
and Gissler, 2012). The registers used have been shown to be accurate
sources for study purposes (Gissler et al., 1995; Gissler and Haukka, 2004;
Sund, 2012). The cohort members have been followed up since the prenatal
period until 25yearsof age (year 2012) regarding mostoutcomes. The differ-
ent data sources and precise periods covered are given in Table I.
All of the health factors used in the study were based on hospital-
diagnosed disorders. The diagnoses were gathered from inpatient visits to
all hospitals and outpatient visits to public hospitals in Finland. Practically all
of the hospitals in Finland are public, i.e. owned by municipalities or joint mu-
nicipal authorities, and no private birth hospitals exist.
When referring to diagnosed disorders, the ninth version of the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) was used from 1987 until 1995
and the 10th version (ICD-10) was used since 1996 (Table II).
Study population
Figure 1 shows the flow chart of the study population, initially consisting of all
the women in the 1987 birth cohort. Cohort members who had died or emi-
grated permanently by the age of 18 years were excluded. After exclusion,
the population was divided into those who had experienced their first preg-
nancy before the age of 20 years and those who had not. The group of preg-
nant teenagers was then further divided on the outcome of pregnancy
(induced abortion [hereon referred to as abortion] or childbirth) and age
(,18 years of age or 18–19 years of age at conception). Miscarriages
were not included, because relevant register information was lacking at the
time of the study.
In thepresentpaper, weconcentrateon comparisons between thosewho
experienced abortion and those who gave birth ,18 years of age (¼
underage). The mean age at conception was 16.5 years (SD 0.99) for the
underageabortiongroupand17.0years(SD0.80)fortheunderagechildbirth
group.Inall,121girls(8.4%ofthosewithunderagepregnancies)hadhadmul-
tiple pregnancies before the age of 18 years, and were included in the group
according to the outcome of their first pregnancy. The majority of pregnan-
cies among ,18-year-olds are likely to be unplanned, thus enabling to some
extent comparisons between these groups.The pregnancygroups consisting
of 18–19-year-olds were also analysed, but comparisons between these
groups are less reliable, as a larger proportion of the pregnancies ending in
childbirth are likely to be planned. To further differentiate for the independ-
entassociationofabortionorchildbirthitselfwiththeincidencesofthehealth
outcomes, we also performed between-group comparisons for before and
after the index pregnancy, using the outcomes registered during the whole
study period (from birth to 25 years of age) and additionally for a period of
1year beforeand afterconceptiononly,whenthepossible effectofchildbirth
orabortionwouldlikelybestrongestontheoutcomesstudies.Thosewithno
teenage pregnancies served as an external reference group, allowing us to
further control for the natural background changes in the incidence of the
studied outcomes.
Background factors
Confoundingbackgroundfactorsincludedfamilialsocioeconomicfactorsand
both of the parents’ and the cohort member’s mental and physical health
factors and are presented in detail in Tables III and IV. These factors were
chosen because they were associated with underage abortion and/or child-
birth in our recent study based on the same cohort comparing the underlying
factors of underage abortion and childbirth (Leppa
¨lahti et al., 2016). All of
these included background factors were allowed to occur at any point
between the cohort member’s birth and conception/start of follow-up.

 outcome because it occurredalmostexclusivelyonly beforepregnancy.Peri-
natal complications included premature birth (,37 weeks), low birthweight
(,2500 g) and/or small-for-gestational age infants, a low Apgar score at
5 min (0–6) and low cord blood pH at birth (,7.05). Chronic physical
illness included asthma, rheumatic disorder, epilepsy, anorexia, cancer, dia-
betes,growthdisorders,obesityandhypertension.Thehighestparentaledu-
cational level was reported as high (minimum of 15 years of education),
intermediate (11–14 years of education) or low (9–10 years of education).
A cohort member’s school performance at 15–16 years of agewas based on
the calculated mean grade in all school subjects, grades varying from 4 to 10.
The cohort members were placed in tertiles depending on whether their
mean grade and school performance was reported as below average
(4.62–7.72), average (7.73–8.56) or above average (8.57–10). Income
support refers to financial assistance funded by municipalities to a person/
family to ensure that the basic needs for living are met.
Early adulthood outcome factors
The early adulthood outcome factors assessed were: (i) socioeconomic
factors including educational level at 25 years of age and whether the
cohort member had received income support or not (occurring at any
given point after 18 years of age); (ii) the most common psychiatric disorders
(occurring at any given point after conception) including any psychiatric dis-
order, psychoactive substance use disorder, mood disorder and neurotic
or stress-related disorders; and (iii) risk-taking (¼tendency to engage in
behaviours that have a potential to be harmful) related adverse health out-
comes (occurring at any given point after conception of first pregnancy), in-
cluding all ICD coded intentional or unintentional poisonings by medications,
drugs or biological substances and all injuries. Poisonings and injuries were
chosen as markers of risk-taking behaviour because of their known associ-
ation with risk-taking (Turner et al., 2004; Zuckerman, 2007). Concerning
psychiatric disorders, the date of first patient contact was used and any
given diagnosis was tallied once per cohort member. Hence, if a cohort
member had a specific diagnosis prior to conception, the same diagnosis
was not noted as an outcome after conception as well, even if patient con-
tacts based on the same diagnosis reoccurred. However, all new psychiatric
diagnosesthatoccurredafterconception werenoted in order to allowevalu-
ation of possible triggering effect of an abortion/childbirth on mental health
risks. For injuries and poisonings, all contacts were noted because of the
short-term nature of these diagnoses. Therefore these diagnoses could
occur in the data before and after conceptions.
Statistical analyses
Age at conception was used to define the date of the start of follow-up for all
the cohort members. Those who did not conceive below the age of 20 years
(the non-pregnant cohort) were allotted randomly selected dates based on
theagesoftheirpregnantpeers,andthesedateswereusedtodefinethestart
of follow-up.
Differences in background factors and early adulthood outcomes were
assessed by using the x2 test and Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.

 A P-value of ,0.05 was defined as statistically significant. Regarding early
adulthood outcomes, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with
their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using binary logistic regres-
sion. The models were fitted separately to each outcome. Because the
study groups differed significantly from each other at the baseline, adjusted
ORs were calculated for all outcome variables. The outcome variables
were adjusted for parental demographic factors and personal background
factors described in the methods section. In the rare instances of small
numbers of cases, variables were removed from the model as necessary.
To minimize bias, we used list-wise deletion in logistic regression analysis
when data were missing (for percentages, see Tables III and IV).
For all of the assessed health outcomes (psychiatric disorders and
risk-taking-related health outcomes), we also calculated the unadjusted ORs
of a given outcome both before and after conception, using those with no
teenage pregnancies as the reference group. The calculations covered the
entire study period from birth to 25 years of age, and also the period of 1 year
before and after conception. The Z statistic was used to evaluate differences
across the models.
IBM SPSS statistics V.22.0 for Windows was used for the statistical analyses.
Ethics approval
We obtained ethics approval from the National Institute for Health and
Welfare (Ethics Committee §28/2009). All the data-keeping organizations
gave their permission to use sensitive health data in scientific research.

 and IV). Compared with the childbirth group, women who had experi-
enced underage abortion often came from families with a more advan-
taged socioeconomic situation, and had achieved higher average
grades at school. They also had a lower likelihood of having a history of
foster care placement, any psychiatric diagnosis or having a mother
whowas ,20yearsofagewhengivingbirthorhadahistoryofpsychiatric
inpatient care. Compared with the external reference group with no
pregnancies ,20yearsofage,bothpregnancygroupshaddisadvantaged
backgrounds, including lower levels of parental education and a higher
need for income support in childhood. They were also more likely to
have been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder before pregnancy, to
have been placed in foster care and to have suffered from poisonings
or injuries and they had poorer school performance at 15–16 years
of age.
Early adulthood outcomes
When the two pregnancy groups were compared after conception,
there were no significant differences regarding the incidence of psychi-
atric disorders. The abortion group was found to be less likely to
achieve only a low level of education or to need income support, but
more likely to have an injury, even after adjusting for confounders
(Table V).
Before and after conception analyses
TableVIshowsthecomparisonsoftheORsforallthehealth-relatedout-
comes (psychiatric disorders and risk-taking-related health outcomes)
before and after conception between the pregnancy groups and the ex-
ternalreferencegroupwithnopregnancies ,20yearsofage.Compared
with the external reference group, both pregnancy groups had increased
risks of all the adverse health outcomes before and after the index preg-
nancy. With the only exception of injuries, the risks for all the assessed
health outcomes within the comparison group (abortion versus no preg-
nancy or delivery versus no pregnancy) did not differ significantly from
each other before and after conception. This was true when the whole
study period was covered (Table VI) and when the period of 1 year
before and after conception only was used (data not shown).
When the whole study period was covered, the OR for injury in the
abortion group was significantly higher after than before the abortion
compared with the external reference group (Table VI). However,
when only the period of 1 year before and after conception was used,
no significant differences in the ORs for injury were observed and the
point estimate was actually lower after than before the index pregnancy
(unadjusted OR before, 2.55 [1.84–3.54]) and unadjusted OR after,
2.00 [1.38–2.90]).
The same analyses were also performed for those who experienced
an abortion or gave birth at 18–19 years of age. The educational out-
comes were similar in those who experienced abortion and those who
gave birth at this age. Compared with those who gave birth, those who
experienced abortion were less likely to be welfare-dependent by the
age of 25 years, but more likely to have a substance use-related disorder
or adverse health outcomes related to risk-taking. The risks of adverse
health outcomes were similarly increased already prior to abortion
(data not shown).
Discussion
In the present nationwide follow-up study of all women born within
1 year in Finland, we found that underage abortion was not associated
with an increased risk of the most common psychiatric disorders or
adverse health outcomes related to risk-taking behaviour. Those who
had undergone abortion achieved higher levels of education and were
less likely to be welfare-dependent compared with those who continued
their pregnancies. Compared with those who had no pregnancies at

 ,20 years of age, the women who had undergone abortion or given
birth at a young age were a disadvantaged group both before and after
conception.
ItshouldbenotedthatFinlandhascomparativelyliberalabortionlegis-
lation.Reproductive health services, including abortion, areequallyavail-
able to all women in public hospitals. Parental consent is not required to
obtain an abortion. Therefore, obstacles to abortion are few and lack of
choice is unlikely to affect the outcome of pregnancy.
Ourstudyaddsto current knowledge in suggestingthatabortionis not
harmful to the mental health of most underage girls. We found no signifi-
cant differences in the risks of psychiatric disorders between those who
had abortion at a young age and those who gave birth. Women with a
history of underage abortion seem to face greater risks of psychiatric dis-
orders in comparison with girls with no pregnancies, but our results
suggest that this vulnerability exists already prior to abortion. In 2008,
The American Psychological Association concluded that the highest
quality scientific evidence indicated no increased risks of mental health
problems caused by abortions among the majority of adult women
(Major et al., 2009). More evidence to support this has since emerged
from carefully designed studies from the Netherlands and the USA
(Munk-Olsen et al., 2011, 2012; Steinberg et al., 2014; Biggs et al.,
2015). However, owing to the small number of studies concerning teen-
agers only, no conclusions could be drawn with regard to the teenage
group. In line with our findings, a small nationally representative survey
carried out in the USA in 2010 revealed that teenagers who had an abor-
tion did not differ from those who gave birth as regards risks of depres-
sionorlowself-esteeminlaterlife(Warrenetal.,2010).Itisimportantto
notethatmostpreviousstudiesreportingassociationsbetweenabortion
and psychiatric ill-health have been criticized for major methodological
flaws (Major et al., 2009). They have lacked the potential to reveal
whether the risks of mental health problems were increased already
prior to conception. Additionally, recent studies comparing the mental
health outcomes between adult women undergoing abortion and
those who give birth have found that those who undergo abortion con-
stitute a subpopulation with higher risks of mental health problems
already prior to pregnancy (Munk-Olsen et al., 2011, 2012). However,
this seems not to be the case among teenagers. In the present study
underage girls who give birth were found to have more mental health
problems prior to pregnancy than those who had an abortion. Thus,
studies concerning the whole teenage population are also necessary.
Our findings concerning risks of injury and accidental or intentional
poisoning with medications or drugs among the abortion group were
similar to those concerning mental health. Associations between
teenage pregnancy and risk-taking have been reported before, but pre-
vious studies have not been concerned about whether or not teenage
pregnancy itself is likely to affect this behaviour (Imamura et al., 2007).
Our study implies that abortion does not seem to have such an effect.
The small protective association that motherhood, compared with
having an abortion, was found to have with being diagnosed with injury
may partly be explained by the fact that motherhood is likely to naturally
reduce various forms of risk-taking behaviour. In addition, the social and
health-care system in Finland offers good support to young mothers free
of charge. Similar support is rarely available after abortion.
In line with previous studies, we found that the women who had
undergone abortion at a young age were significantly less likely to
have economic struggles and low educational levels by the age of 25
years compared with those who gave birth (Zabin et al., 1989; Bailey
et al., 2001; Otterblad Olausson et al., 2004). Longer follow-up

Underage abortion: outcomes in early adulthood

 Overall, the differences in the early health adulthood outcomes
between the young women who experienced underage abortion and
those who gave birth were minimal in the present study. Compared
with the large reference group of women with no pregnancies at a
young age, those who experienced an abortion before 18 years of age
were a highly selected group. They often had a substantially disadvanta-
geous background and faced multiple challenges already prior to preg-
nancy. Based on these findings, it seems likely that, in a welfare society,
underage abortion in itself is not associated with adverse socioeconomic
and mental health outcomes. Rather, the adverse backgrounds of the
girls seem to explain much of the later challenges.
The present study is based on a unique, large and nationwide cohort.
The Finnish health registers cover practically all births and induced abor-
tions in Finland (Gissler et al., 1995, 1996). No selection or recall bias
affectsourresults.Toovercomethechallengeofcomparingtheoutcomes
ofgroupsthatdifferedsignificantlyalreadyatbaseline,weperformedrigor-
ous adjustment for confounders and between-group comparisons of
adversehealthoutcomesbeforeand aftertheindexpregnancyintwosep-
aratetimewindows.Thisallowsafairlyaccurateevaluationofindependent
correlation between abortion and the outcomes.
The weaknesses of the study are also acknowledged. The registers
used did not include information on the intentionality of the pregnancy.
We aimed to minimize this disadvantage by focusing on underagegirls, as
themajorityoftheirpregnanciesarelikelytobeunintended,regardlessof
theoutcome.Weincludedwomenwhohadexperiencedmorethanone
teenage pregnancy, which could result in some exaggeration of the eval-
uated risks in our study. It must also be noted that we did not have infor-
mation on adoptions. Although giving a newborn up for adoption is not
common in Finland, it can be assumed that some of the teenagers who
gavebirthwerenotthecarersoftheirbiologicalchildren.Finally,thediag-
noses were based on hospital-diagnosed disorders, and visits to health-
care centres and private clinics were not available from registers.
Thepresentstudyhaspracticalimplications.Theresultssuggestthatin
a setting of liberal abortion legislation and readily available reproductive
services for all citizens, underage abortion itself is not associated with
psychiatric ill-health or risk-taking behaviour and seems to mitigate
some of the poor educational and economic outcomes after underage
childbirth. This information should be acknowledged and used when
counselling young girls facing unplanned pregnancies. Compared with
those who do not have conceptions at a young age, some girls who
undergo abortion may be more likely to face multiple challenges in life,
and this vulnerability seems to exist already prior to abortion. This
group of girls requires extra support by the health-care and social ser-
vices to prevent further adverse outcomes.
