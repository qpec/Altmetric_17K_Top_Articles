Abstract 
Aluminium (Al) oxyhydroxide (Alhydrogel®), the main adjuvant licensed for human and 
animal vaccines, consists of primary nanoparticles that spontaneously agglomerate. Concerns 
about its safety emerged following recognition of its unexpectedly long-lasting biopersistence 
within immune cells in some individuals, and reports of chronic fatigue syndrome, cognitive 
dysfunction, myalgia, dysautonomia and autoimmune/inflammatory features temporally 
linked to multiple Al-containing vaccine administrations. Mouse experiments have 
documented its capture and slow transportation by monocyte-lineage cells from the injected 
muscle to lymphoid organs and eventually the brain. The present study aimed at evaluating 
mouse brain function and Al concentration 180 days after injection of various doses of 
Alhydrogel® (200, 400 and 800 µg Al/kg of body weight) in the tibialis anterior muscle in 
adult female CD1 mice. Cognitive and motor performances were assessed by 8 validated 
tests, microglial activation by Iba-1 immunohistochemistry, and Al level by graphite furnace 
atomic absorption spectroscopy.  
An unusual neuro-toxicological pattern limited to a low dose of Alhydrogel® was observed. 
Neurobehavioural changes, including decreased activity levels and altered anxiety-like 
behaviour, were observed compared to controls in animals exposed to 200 µg Al/kg but not at 
400 and 800 µg Al/kg. Consistently, microglial number appeared increased in the ventral 
forebrain of the 200 µg Al/kg group. Cerebral Al levels were selectively increased in animals 
exposed to the lowest dose, while muscle granulomas had almost completely disappeared at 6 
months in these animals.  
We conclude that Alhydrogel® injected at low dose in mouse muscle may selectively induce 
long-term Al cerebral accumulation and neurotoxic effects. To explain this unexpected result, 
an avenue that could be explored in the future relates to the adjuvant size since the injected 
suspensions corresponding to the lowest dose, but not to the highest doses, exclusively 
contained small agglomerates in the bacteria-size range known to favour capture and, 
presumably, transportation by monocyte-lineage cells. In any event, the view that 
Alhydrogel® neurotoxicity obeys “the dose makes the poison” rule of classical chemical 
toxicity appears overly simplistic.

1. Introduction 
Many severe infectious diseases can be prevented and some of them have been eradicated by 
vaccines. Commonly used vaccines are generally well tolerated and considered safe by 
regulatory agencies. However, as other effective medical compounds, vaccines may 
occasionally cause adverse effects. In particular, a condition manifesting by the combination 
of myalgia, arthralgia, chronic fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, dysautonomia and 
autoimmunity has been temporally linked to aluminium adjuvant-containing vaccine 
administration, called Macrophagic Myofasciitis (MMF) (Gherardi 2003; Authier et al., 2003; 
Exley et al., 2009; Rosenblum et al., 2011; Santiago et al., 2014; Brinth et al., 2015; Palmieri 
et al., 2016).  
Although no consensus has been reached so far on a cause-to-effect relationship, 
environmental aluminium has long been suspected to act as a co-factor of several chronic 
neurological diseases (Van Rensburg et al., 2001; De Sole et al., 2013; Exley 2013, 2014) and 
the idea has emerged that aluminium adjuvants may be insidiously unsafe over the long-term 
in some predisposed individuals (reviewed in Tomljenovic and Shaw, 2011; Gherardi et al., 
 4 
 
 
2015). Among aluminium salts used in vaccines, crystalline Al hydroxide or oxyhydroxide  
(Alhydrogel®) is the more widely used and is found in vaccines against tetanus, hepatitis A, 
hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae B, pneumococcal and meningococcal infections, and 
anthrax (Gherardi et al., 2015). This adjuvant consists of primary particles in the nano-sized 
range spontaneously forming micron-sized agglomerates (Eidi et al., 2015).  
Although aluminium salts have been added to vaccines since 1926 (Glenny et al., 1926), exact 
mechanisms underlying their immuno-potentiating effects remain incompletely understood 
(Exley et al., 2010). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that alum particles, as 
other poorly degradable particles, may not stay entirely localized in the injected tissue in 
mice, but can disseminate within phagocytic cells to regional lymph nodes and then to more 
distant sites and to the brain (Khan et al., 2013; Crépeaux et al., 2015; Eidi et al., 2015). In 
contrast to a previous belief, alum is characterized by striking biopersistence within immune 
cells in both the injected muscle, and the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and spleen, where it 
may be found in conspicuous quantities 9 months after injection (Crépeaux et al., 2015). In 
humans, long term biopersistence of aluminium hydroxide within innate immune cells causes 
a specific lesion at site of previous immunization, called MMF, that may be detected up to 
>12 years after the last vaccine injection (Gherardi et al., 2001) in patients with a clinical 
condition now designated as ASIA ‘Autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by 
adjuvants’ (Shoenfeld et al., 2011). 
The potential impact of aluminium adjuvant on the nervous system has been studied in mouse 
models. Alhydrogel® adjuvant, dosed at 100 µg Al/kg and subcutaneously injected in CD1 
mice induced motor deficits and cognitive alterations associated with motor neuron death and 
a significant increase (350%) of reactive astrocytes indicative of an inflammatory process 
(Petrik et al., 2007). Although no motor neuron death was observed at the dose of 300 µg 
 5 
 
 
Al/kg, both microglial and astroglial reactions were observed in the spinal cord and were 
associated with altered motor and cognitive functions in CD1 mice (Shaw and Petrik, 2009).  
In the same way, a neuro-inflammatory/degenerative syndrome has been described in sheep 
after repeated administrations of alum-containing vaccines (Luján et al., 2013), and 
impairment of neurocognitive functions and brain gliosis were reported in a murine model of 
systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease following intramuscular injection of Al hydroxide 
or vaccine against the hepatitis B virus (Agmon-Levin et al., 2014).  
Previous in vivo aluminium adjuvant neurotoxicological studies did not include dose-response 
analyses. However, several reports studying neurotoxicity of soluble aluminium compounds 
administered by the oral route (Al chloride, Al nitrate, Al ammonium sulfate) to rodents 
showed a non-linear biphasic response on acetyl-cholinesterase activity (Kumar, 1998), 
dopamine turnover (Tsunoda and Sharma, 1999), nitric oxide synthase expression (Kim, 
2003), and behavioural performances (Roig et al., 2006). Poorly understood biphasic Al 
effects were also observed in vitro: cell cultures showing increased cell growth at low 
concentrations and diminished cell growth at high concentrations (Exley and Birchall, 1992). 
Similar unusual observations were made in studies of hippocampal long-term potentiation 
(Platt et al., 1995), and neuronal cell death in NSC-34 neuron-like cells (Eidi et al., 2015).  
The present dose-response study was designed to evaluate long-term aluminium hydroxide 
neurotoxicity by assessing mouse behaviour, aluminium cerebral concentrations and 
microglial changes in CD1 mice 180 days after intramuscular injections of Alhydrogel®. 
Strikingly, the lower dose selectively induced neurobehavioural changes, cerebral aluminium 
level increases and microglial activation.

2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Alhydrogel® doses 
Animals were injected with Alhydrogel® adjuvant (InvivoGen), the characteristics of which 
have been previously determined in terms of size and positive zeta potential (Eidi et al., 
2015). Doses were calculated by reference to medical histories of MMF patients who received 
a median of 4 doses of an Al-containing vaccine within the 10 years prior to their diagnosis 
(Gherardi et al., 2001). A 60-kg woman (MMF affects mainly women) injected with 1 dose of 
HBV ENGERIX® vaccine (GSK laboratories, France) receives 500 μg of Al, i.e. 8.3 μg 
Al/kg of body weight. Extrapolating mouse to human dosage is a challenging issue. Although 
a firm scientific basis for allometric conversion is still lacking, we used an allometry 
calculation based on body surface area that reflects the metabolic rate to determine the human 
equivalent dose per Kg. This x12.3 allometric conversion factor from human to mouse 
(Sharma and McNeill, 2009) is easy to apply, and has been recommended to us by 
toxicologists of the French drug agency (AFFSAPS). Conversion resulted in an approximate 
of 100 μg Al/kg mouse body weight for one human dose. Four groups were used: control 
group (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle: Phosphate 0.1M; NaCl 0.9%; pH 7,4); 
Alhydrogel® groups at the doses of 200, 400 or 800 µg Al/kg, in 3 injections of Alhydrogel 
in 20 µl PBS with a four-day interval. The animals thus received the mouse equivalent of 2, 4 
and 8 human doses of Al-containing vaccine. 
 
2.2. Animals 
40 female CD1 mice, weighing 25-30 g (7 week old), were obtained from Charles Rivers 
Laboratories (France). Upon arrival, the females were housed at 5 animals per cage. Animals 
were maintained under a 12h light cycle (8.00: 20.00), at a constant temperature (22 ± 2°C) 
and a relative humidity of 55 ± 10%. Mice were given ad libitum access to food and water. 
 8 
 
 
After a 1-week period for acclimatization, 8-week old females were separated in 4 
experimental groups of 10 animals, and 20 µL im injections were made in the left tibialis 
anterior, with a 4-day interval between each injection.  
At the end of the behavioural tests, 5 animals per group were sacrificed with an overdose of 
pentobarbital 
and 
transcardially 
perfused 
with 
PBS 
followed 
by 
ice-cold 
4% 
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were collected for histological examination, post-
fixed in PFA for 4 hours at 4°C and immersed overnight in a 30% sucrose/PBS solution, then 
frozen and stored at -80°C until sectioning. Whole brains were serially cut into 40 µm-thick 
coronal cryosections stored at -20°C until use. 
The other 5 animals per group were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital. Brains were 
retrieved, quickly frozen in isopentane and kept at -80°C for subsequent  determination of Al 
levels. 
All the experiments on animals were performed in respect to the guidelines provided by the 
European Union (Directive 2010/63/EU). 
 
2.3. Behavioural and motor testing 
A battery of 8 behavioural or physical tests was performed in the 4 experimental groups 
(n=10 mice/group) 180 days after the third injection. Tests were chosen in order to assess 
locomotor activity in the open-field (Walsh and Cummins, 1976), level of anxiety in the O-
maze (Sheperd et al., 1994; Coutellier et al., 2009), short-term memory in the novel object 
recognition test (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988; Dudchenko, 2004; Ennaceur, 2010; Moore et 
al., 2013), muscular strength in the wire mesh hang (Kondziela, 1964) and the grip strength 
tests (Maurissen et al., 2003), locomotor coordination in the rotarod test (Pratte et al., 2011), 
depression in the tail suspension test (Steru et al., 1985), and pain sensitivity in the hot plate 
test (Espejo and Mir, 1993). 
 9 
 
 
All the tests were performed under white light < 100 lux between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. They were 
video-recorded and all the variables were analyzed by the same experimenter, using 
ViewPoint Life Sciences Inc software (Canada). 
The animals were transferred to the behavioural testing room 30 min prior to beginning of test 
in order to let the animal adapt to the test room conditions. Between each animal, the 
apparatus was cleaned with a 30% ethanol solution. At the end of a whole testing session, 
mice were sacrificed and samples were retrieved. 
 
Open-field 
The general locomotor activity was assessed by the open-field test (Walsh and Cummins, 
1976). The apparatus was made of a square open-field arena (42cm side x 25cm high walls) 
with the floor divided into 3 distinct areas: the peripheral, the medium and the central areas. 
At the beginning of the test, the mouse was placed in the center of the central area, and was let 
free to explore for 5 min. During this period the total distance and the distance and time spent 
in each of the three areas and the number of rearing, were recorded. 
 
Elevated O-maze 
The level of animal anxiety was assessed by the elevated O-maze test (Sheperd et al., 1994), 
with the advantage of the lack of the ambiguous central square compared to the traditional 
plus-maze (Coutellier et al., 2009). The maze was elevated to a 70cm height, with 2 open 
(50x10cm) and 2 closed (50x10x40cm) arms. Arms of the same type were opposite to each 
other. Each mouse was tested within a 5-min test session. At the beginning, a mouse was 
placed individually in one of the closed arms, and was allowed to freely explore the maze. 
The time spent in closed and open arms, latency time to exit the closed arm for the first time, 
and the number of head-dippings and rearings were recorded.

Novel object recognition test 
The novel object recognition test (NOR) was first proposed by Ennaceur and Delacour in 
1988. This test is based on the spontaneous behaviour of rodents to interact more with a novel 
object than with a familiar one because of their inherent preference for novelty. Thus, in this 
test, rodents must be able to remember the previously encountered familiar object to 
determine which object is ‘‘novel’’ during the test trial (Moore et al., 2013). 
The NOR task can be configured to cover various aspects and types of memory, including 
working memory (Dudchenko, 2004; Ennaceur, 2010). 
The apparatus consisted of a square chamber (40 x 40 x 25 cm) and a digital camera was used 
to record behaviour videos. Videos were analyzed and the time spent by mice exploring each 
object was measured. The test consisted of four sessions: habituation to the field (10 min, day 
1), habituation to objects (5 min, day 1), familiarization phase with 2 identical objects (5 min, 
day 2), test 1h later (5 min, day 2), with one familiar and one novel object. The novel objects 
were different in shape and colour but similar in size. The interaction of mouse with both 
objects (familiar and novel) was recorded for 5 min and percent discrimination index was 
calculated to determine memory performance as follow:  
Discrimination index = exploration time with novel object/(exploration time with familiar 
object + novel object) x 100. 
Exploration of an object is defined as the orientation of animal’s snout toward the object, 
sniffing or touching with snout, while running around the object, sitting or climbing on it was 
not recorded as exploration (Antunes and Biala, 2012). 
 
Wire mesh hang test 
The hang wire mesh test was designed to test muscle strength using all four limbs (Kondziela, 
1964). The inverted screen is a 43 cm square of wire mesh consisting of 12 mm squares of 1 
 11 
 
 
mm diameter wire. The time during which the animals were able to sustain their weight 
holding onto the metal rail suspended in midair above the surface of soft bedding material 
was recorded for a 5 min-maximum time. Each mouse was subjected to three trials and the 
best performance was retained. Mouse body weight was considered, because this variable can 
influence performance. 
 
Grip strength test 
The rodent grip strength test was developed to measure muscular strength (Maurissen et al., 
2003). The apparatus (Bio-GS3, Bioseb, France) consists of a grasping device or platform (i.e. 
grid and T-bar) that is connected to a load cell. The test measurement is conducted by 
allowing the animal to grasp the device and then having the experimenter pull it away until its 
grip is broken. The maximal force achieved by the animal was recorded for two types of 
measurements: forelimb measurement and forelimb and hindlimb measurement. Five such 
trials for the forelimbs and five others for the four limbs were performed and both best 
performances were kept. 
 
Accelerating rotarod 
Motor coordination and balance were tested using an accelerating rotarod (LE8200, Bioseb, 
France) consisting of a 3cm diameter drum (15 cm above the base), divided with flanges into 
five lanes (Pratte et al., 2011). The apparatus is electronically controlled and evenly increases 
the speed of the bar from 4 to 40 rpm over a 5-min session. The mice were placed on the rod 
body orientation opposite to beam movement in the longitudinal axis, so that forward 
locomotion was necessary to avoid a fall. The mice were acclimated and trained on a morning 
session, and then they were given five successive trials on the afternoon. The best trial 
 12 
 
 
(longest latency to fall) for each mouse was retained. Since body weight may affect 
performance, mouse weight was considered in the score determination. 
 
Tail suspension test 
The method is based on the observation that a mouse suspended by the tail shows alternate 
periods of agitation characterized by intense motor activity and expense of energy, and 
waiting-behaviour with immobility and energy saving (Steru et al., 1985). 
For these experiments, the mouse was hung on a hook by an adhesive tape placed 20 mm 
from the extremity of its tail. Mice were both acoustically and visually isolated. Each mouse 
was suspended by its tail for 5 min, allowing the ventral surface and front and hind limbs to 
be video-recorded using a digital camera facing the test box. Total immobility time and 
latency time to be immobile were measured during the entire 5 min test period. Immobility 
was defined as the absence of initiated movements, and included passive waving of the body. 
Times were scored manually by observer watching the video. Each mouse was tested only 
once. Mouse body weight was considered in the score determination. 
 
Hot plate test 
The hot plate test is a behavioural model of nociception in which mice display several 
noxious-evoked patterns as well as exploratory and self-care responses (Espejo and Mir, 
1993). The animals were individually placed on a preheated 50°C hotplate (LE7406 Bioseb, 
France). An open-ended cylindrical Plexiglas tube with a 20 cm diameter and a 25 cm height 
was placed on top of the hot plate to prevent the mice from escaping but leaving their paws 
exposed to the hot plate. The time from placing the animals on the hot plate to the time of the 
first paw lick, the first rearing and the first jump were measured with a stopwatch. To prevent 
 13 
 
 
issue damage, the mice were removed from the hot plate after 3 min regardless of their 
response. Mice were observed only once. 
 
2.4. Microglia immunohistochemistry 
Analyses were carried out on 3 brains per group. Brain sections were incubated with primary 
antibody Anti-Iba1 (goat ab5076, AbCam Paris, France, 1/2000 in PBS with 1% BSA) 
overnight at 4°C. Then sections were incubated with secondary biotinylated rabbit anti-goat 
antibody (1/200, Vector Laboratories, Paris, France) for 2 h at room temperature. Labeling 
was determined using the chromogenic diaminobenzidine (DAB) method. 
Microscopy: Brain sections were viewed with a Zeiss AxioPlan (Carl ZeissCanada Limited, 
Toronto, ON, Canada) microscope at 20x magnification. Images were captured using 
Zen2012 software. Microglia cell density and cell body area were measured in 4 regions 
mapped by reference to the Paxinos mouse brain atlas (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001): ventral 
forebrain, inferior colliculus and visual and motor cortex. Determinations were done on 
selected areas (mean area of 175,000 µm2) in 3 animals per group, by at least 2 of us, blinded 
for the identity of the group.  
 
2.5. Brain Al analysis 
Analyses were carried out on 5 brains per group (groups PBS, Alhydrogel® (133, 200, 800 µg 
Al/kg) 180 days following injection, according to the published method of House et al., 
(2012) and as described in our previous study (Crépeaux et al., 2015). Briefly, Al 
concentrations were determined by TH GFAAS in half brains dried to a constant weight at 
37°C and digested in a microwave (MARS Xpress CEM Microwave Technology Ltd) in a 
mixture of 1 mL 15.8 M HNO3 (Fischer Analytical Grade) and 1 mL of 30% w/v H2O2 (BDH 
Aristar Grade). Digests were clear and colourless or light yellow with no visible precipitate or 
 14 
 
 
fatty residue. Upon cooling each digest was diluted to a total volume of 5 mL with ultrapure 
water. Total Al was measured immediately post digestion using an AAnalyst 600 atomic 
absorption spectrometer with a transversely heated graphite atomizer (THGA) and 
longitudinal Zeeman-effect background corrector and an AS-800 autosampler with WinLab32 
software (Perkin Elmer, UK). Standard THGA pyrolitically-coated graphite tubes with 
integrated L’Vovplatform (Perkin Elmer, UK) were used. The Zeeman background corrected 
peak area of the atomic absorption signal was used for the determinations. 
Results were expressed as µg Al/g tissue dry weight. Each determination was the arithmetic 
mean of a triplicate analysis. 
 
2.6. Muscle analysis 
Analyses were carried out on 3 muscles per group (groups PBS, Alhydrogel® (200, 400, 800 
µg Al/kg) 180 days following injection. Serial muscle tissue sections of 10 µm were 
successively deposited on 30 different Superfrost®-plus slides in order to obtain 30 identical 
series. For each animal one slide containing 20 representative longitudinal sections was used 
for haematoxylin-eosin staining, and two alternate slides were treated for Morin staining and 
CD11b immunostaining respectively. 
- Immunostaining was done using commercial primary antibody routinely used in the lab, 
raised against CD11b (1/50, AbD Serotec, MCA711, Oxford, UK). The labeling was made 
with Cyanine 3 AffiniPure F(ab')₂ Fragment Donkey Anti-Rat  (1/200, Jackson 
ImmunoResearch laboratory INC, Suffolk, UK).  
- Al was stained with Morin (M4008-2 G, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France) 
that was dissolved in a solution consisting of 0.5% acetic acid in 85% ethanol. Formation of a 
fluorescent complex with Al was detected under a 420 nm excitation wavelength as an intense 
green fluorescence with a characteristic 520 nm emission.  
 15 
 
 
- Conventional microscopy was done using Carl Zeiss photonic and fluorescence 
microscopes.  
- The presence of a muscle granuloma was semi-quantitatively assessed at magnification x20, 
and quoted as: 0 (no or virtually no inflammatory cell), + (1 to 3 small granulomas), ++ (>3 
small granulomas), +++ (>3 large granulomas).  
 
2.7. Statistical analysis 
Normality distribution of data was first analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk test, and then parametric or 
non-parametric tests were decided according to p values of Shapiro-Wilk test, i.e. parametric 
tests (ANOVA or Student’s t-test) can be used when normality distribution is assumed 
p>0.05, whereas we used non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis test) when normality 
distribution is not assumed (p<0.05).  Data from behavioural tests were analyzed using a one-
way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). Post hoc comparisons have been performed 
using the Bonferroni’s test when Anova was significant. Data from microglia IHC were 
analyzed using a Student’s t-test. Data from Al concentration measurement were analyzed 
using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Mann–Whitney procedure modified 
for multiple comparisons when appropriate. Significance was set at p<0.05. All statistical 
analyses were carried out using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS INC., Chicago, IL, USA).

3. Results 
3.1. Body weight 
The initial body weight was 30g. Animals were weighed once a week during the whole 
procedure. No effects of treatment were observed on body weight (data not shown). 
 
3.2. Behavioural tests 
Open-field 
In the open-field (Table 1), a one-way ANOVA showed a significant difference of the total 
distance walked (p=0.012), the distance in peripheral area (p=0.002), and time spent in both 
central (p=0.013) and peripheral (p=0.003) areas (Fig 1a, b, c, d). Bonferroni’s post hoc 
analysis showed that mice from the group Alhydrogel® 200 µg Al/kg crossed a significantly 
smaller total distance (p=0.026) and distance in the peripheral area (p=0.005) (1303.48 ± 
213.04 cm and 643.61 ± 142.06 cm respectively) than controls (2401.01 ± 300.62 cm). 
Furthermore, animals injected with Alhydrogel® 200 µg Al/kg spent more time (p=0.047) in 
the central (62.34 ± 21.22 s) and less (p=0.044) in the peripheral areas (144.43 ± 22.43 s), as 
compared to controls (respectively 25.30 ± 5.17 s and 196.68 ± 9.94 s). 
 
Elevated o-maze 
In the elevated O-maze (Table S1 in the supplemental data section) no significant differences 
between groups were observed across all measured variables. 
 
Novel object recognition test 
On the novel object recognition test (Table S2 in the supplemental data section), one-way 
ANOVA did not reveal any statistical significant difference between groups across all studied 
variables. 
 
 17 
 
 
Grip strength test 
In the grip strength test (Table 2), significant difference (p=0.011) between groups was 
observed for the 4-limb grip strength (Fig 1e). Animals injected with Alhydrogel® at 200 µg 
Al/kg tended (p=0.076) to have less strength (187.24 ± 9.84 g) compared to controls (246.76 
± 16.46 g). 
 
Wire-mesh hang test, Accelerating rotarod, hot plate test and Tail suspension test 
No statistical differences were observed between the 4 experimental groups for these 4 tests 
(Tables S3-6 in the supplemental data section).  
 
3.3. Microglia immunohistochemistry 
As shown in Fig 2, Alhydrogel® injections at doses of 200 µg Al/kg induced a significant 
increase (p=0.033) in the number of Iba-1+ microglial cells in the ventral forebrain (81.90 ± 
5.30 cells/mm2) compared to controls (51.43 ± 7.87 cells/mm2). Microglial density was 
similar to controls in visual and motor cortex and inferior colliculus in all groups. Microglial 
cell body size was similar in all groups (data not shown). 
 
3.4. Cerebral Al level 
The measurement of cerebral Al levels (Table 3) revealed a significantly (p=0.011) higher Al 
level in brains from animals injected with 200 µg Al/kg (median value 1.00 µg/g of dry 
weight) than in brains from control group (0.02 µg/g of dry weight). No significant increase 
was observed in animals injected with 400 or 800 µg Al/kg (Fig 3). 
 
3.5. Muscle analysis 
Granulomas with aluminium accumulations within macrophages were detected by Morin stain 
in the injected muscle of 5 animals (Fig 4). As shown in table 4, granulomas were found in 
 18 
 
 
3/3 mice injected with 800 µg Al/kg, 3/3 mice injected with 400 µg Al/kg, and 0/3 mice 
injected with 200 µg Al/kg. The highest granuloma size was detected in mice injected with 
800 µg Al/kg (Fig 4). An unusual aspect reminiscent of aluminium adjuvant-induced pseudo-
lymphoma (Maubec et al., 2005) was observed in one case of the 800 µg Al/kg group and in 
another one of the 400 µg Al/kg group. The lesion appeared as a dense central area filled with 
monocyte-like and small lymphocytic cells and a rim of large macrophages with clear 
cytoplasm (Fig 4a), in which aluminium was accumulated (Fig 4b, c). Medium-sized CD11b-
expressing monocyte lineage cells were found throughout the dense area of the lesion (Fig 4d, 
e) often mixed with abundant nuclei of other mononuclear cell types as assessed by DAPI 
staining (Figure 4d). Multinucleated giant cells were not found. 
 
4. Discussion 
In the present study, 8 widely used behavioural tests performed 180 days after im injections of 
200, 400, or 800 µg Al/kg in form of Alhydrogel®, in adult female CD1 mice, showed 
significant effects restricted to animals exposed to the lowest dose. Animals injected with 200 
µg Al/kg showed decreased locomotor activity levels assessed by lower total distance crossed 
in the open-field, as reported previously after subcutaneous injection of 100 and 300 µg Al/kg 
of Alhydrogel® (Petrik et al., 2007; Shaw and Petrik, 2009), with concomitant decrease of the 
grip strength test suggestive of moderate motor weakness. In addition, increase of time spent 
in central area concomitantly with a decrease of both walked distance and time spent in 
peripheral area pointed to a behavioural change impacting the protective aversion of rodents 
for open spaces (Bourin et al., 2007), whereas other studies have reported increased anxiety 
levels (Petrik et al., 2007; Agmon-Levin et al., 2014). In sharp contrast, the highest doses of 
400 and 800 µg Al/kg did not cause such changes. Consistently with the altered behavioural 
tests, microglial cell density appeared significantly increased in animals exposed to 200 µg 
Al/kg. This mild cerebral innate immune activation was selectively observed in ventral 
 19 
 
 
forebrain including the amygdaloid nuclei, which are implicated in aversion/anxiety-like 
behaviours (Ledoux, 2007). Moreover, Al cerebral levels were significantly increased in 
animals injected with 200 µg Al/kg, but not in those injected with 400 and 800 µg Al/kg 
doses which showed neither neurobehavioural changes nor microglial reaction. The increased 
level of aluminium in brain was associated with an almost complete disappearance of 
aluminium-induced granuloma in mice injected with 200 µg Al/kg, while granulomas were 
constantly detected in the muscles injected with 400 or 800 µg Al/kg. In addition to 
conspicuous granuloma formation, 2/6 of these animals exhibited a pseudo-lymphomatous 
aspect suggesting an unusually strong local immune reaction to the foreign material.  
In the present study we did not assess the concentration of Al in other tissues such as blood. 
Indeed, by using isotopic 26Al, it was previously shown that the maximal increase in the 
plasma Al within 28 days after Al hydroxide im injection in the rabbit was about 2 ng/mL. 
Since the normal Al concentration was about 30 ng/mL in the animal, it was said that such a 
small increase would have been masked by the Al background if 26Al-labelled adjuvants 
were not used (Flarend et al., 1997). Thus, Al plasma level determination on the long term, 
i.e. 6 months after im injection, cannot provide information in our mice. Furthermore in the 
present study the proposed method whereby Al is transported to organs and tissues which are 
distant from the injection site does not actually involve the dissolution of the Al adjuvant into 
the muscle interstitial fluid and thereafter the blood but we are proposing that the transport of 
significant amounts of Al takes place in those cells which have infiltrated the injection site 
and taken up Al by endocytosis. Considering measurements of Al in muscle biopsies as a 
means of understanding how much Al remained at the injection site, we thought that these 
biopsies would not discriminate between extracellular and intracellular Al and hence Al that 
was likely to remain close to the injection site and that which would be transported away from 
the site as an intracellular burden.

Evidence of a non-linear dose response curve of the neurotoxic effects of Alhydrogel®, with 
selective toxicity of the lowest dose used in the study challenges the classic toxicology 
paradigm “the dose makes the poison”. Non-monotonic dose-response curves have been 
previously reported in the field of aluminium toxicology. Non-monotonic biphasic neurotoxic 
effects have been observed both in vitro (see for review Exley and Birchall, 1992; Platt et al., 
1995; Eidi et al., 2015) and in vivo (Kumar, 1998; Tsunoda and Sharma, 1999; Kim, 2003; 
Roig et al., 2006) after oral Al administration. However, the dose-response curve of the 
present study was not biphasic. Moreover, since cerebral aluminium level was not increased 
in mice injected with 400 or 800 µg Al/kg, the lack of neurotoxicity observed with these high 
doses was likely due to limited Al cerebral translocation, rather than to its paradoxical 
cytotoxic effects on neural cells. This puzzling result is challenging in the absence of solid 
knowledge on Alhydrogel® pharmacokinetics. We previously studied the fate of aluminium 
particles following im injections. Aluminium hydroxide is a highly hydrated crystalline 
compound composed of elementary nano-needles of approximately 2.2 nm x 4.5 nm x 10 nm 
(Mao et al., 2013) and displays a fibrous morphology at transmission electron microscopy 
(Shirodkar et al., 1990; Eidi et al., 2015). This compound spontaneously forms micron-sized 
agglomerates (Johnston et al., 2002), subjected to slight size variations after antigen 
adsorption (Eidi et al., 2015) and in vivo interactions with phosphate, organic acid and 
proteinaceous environments. A series of recent reports from our laboratory have shown that 
translocation of aluminium hydroxide may be specifically related to monocyte lineage cell 
uptake of this poorly biodegradable compound (Khan et al., 2013; Crépeaux et al., 2015; Eidi 
et al., 2015), likely resulting from phagocytosis or macropinocytosis (Mao et al., 2013). 
Recent studies suggest that the adjuvant effect requires uptake by dendritic cells (Morefield et 
al., 2005) and combines i) local up-regulation of chemokines, including CCL2 (MCP-1) and 
CCL3 (MIP-1α), that increase the recruitment of immune cells into the injection site; ii) 
 21 
 
 
increase of antigen uptake by innate immune cells; iii) induction of monocyte differentiation 
into dendritic cells, and iv) facilitation of migration of dendritic cells towards the dLNs to 
prime adaptive immune responses (Seubert et al., 2008). Macrophages capture bacteria which 
are usually in the 1-4 µm size range (Kowalski et al., 1999). A previous report showed in vitro 
exposure of monocyte lineage THP1 cells to Alhydrogel® 200 µg Al/mL resulted in cellular 
incorporation of Alhydrogel® agglomerates, the size of which was 1.20 µm as measured by 
transmission electron microscopy after 24h (Mold et al., 2014; Mold et al., 2016). 
Consistently, this size range was shown to be optimal for particle uptake by mouse peritoneal 
macrophages (1-2 µm) (Tabata and Ikada, 1988) and for particle attachment and subsequent 
internalization by mouse alveolar macrophages (2-3 µm), whereas internalization markedly 
drops when the size exceeds 4.2 µm (Champion et al., 2008). 
Alhydrogel® biopersistence was confirmed in a variety of laboratory animal models up to 6-
12 months post-injection, in both the injected muscle (Verdier et al., 2005; Authier et al., 
2006; Khan et al., 2013; Eidi et al., 2015) and distant lymphoid organs (Crépeaux et al., 
2015). Particles traffic from an injected tissue to the dLNs is size-dependent, smaller particles 
(20-200 nm) being able to drain in a free form whereas medium-sized particles (0.5-2 µm) are 
exclusively subjected to cell transportation (Manolova et al., 2008). Although the point has 
not been precisely addressed in the literature for particles > 2 µm, it seems possible that rapid 
cellular uptake of limited size particles is associated with quicker cell transportation to dLNs 
compared to large particles subjected to slow cell uptake, showing that, in this period of time, 
lower doses of adjuvant can diffuse in the body and reach the brain whereas higher ones do 
not, for a considered time point (Crépeaux et al., 2015). 
On these grounds, we performed an exploratory evaluation of the size of agglomerates, a 
parameter that could be modified when concentration of the colloid suspension is increased to 
adjust doses (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 g Al/L in PBS 1X corresponding to 200, 400, and 800 µg Al/kg 
 22 
 
 
respectively). Dynamic light scattering showed that the colloid suspensions in PBS at pH 7.2 
corresponding to the neurotoxic 200 µg Al/kg condition was exclusively composed of small 
bacteria-size agglomerates (mean = 1750 ± 100 nm), easily captured by innate immune cells. 
In contrast, suspensions corresponding to higher doses showed 2 size peaks, including one 
peak corresponding to very large agglomerates (about 35000 nm) and another one 
corresponding to either small agglomerates (mean = 1500 ± 400 nm in the 400 µg Al/kg 
condition) or medium-sized agglomerates (mean = 4800 ± 500 nm in the 800 µg Al/kg 
condition). 
Although further studies are clearly required to document the influence of Alhydrogel® 
agglomeration state on in vivo neurotoxic effects, such a finding would not be unprecedented 
in the field of particle toxicology since both cellular uptake and distribution in the body of 
other types of particles are influenced by the particle size (Buzea et al., 2007; Reddy et al., 
2007; Landsiedel et al., 2012), and aggregation rate (Mühlfeld et al., 2008), two parameters 
that strongly determine particle toxicity (Bell et al., 2014; Leclerc et al., 2012; Nascarella and 
Calabrese, 2012; Mold et al., 2016). 
 
In conclusion, the non-linear dose-response profile documented herein, in which the lowest 
dose but not the highest doses is neurotoxic in mice, is a novel insight in the field of 
aluminium adjuvant safety. It may suggest that Alhydrogel® toxicity obeys the specific rules 
of particle toxicology rather than any simplistic dose-response relationship. As a possible 
consequence, comparing vaccine adjuvant exposure to other non-relevant aluminium 
exposures, e.g. soluble aluminium and other routes of exposure, may not represent valid 
approaches. For example, aluminium retention rate observed after intravenous injections of 
traceable soluble aluminium citrate (Priest, 2004) has been used to set up the reassuring infant 
retention model of aluminium adjuvants (Mitkus et al., 2011). This model was based on the 
 23 
 
 
hypothesis that aluminium adjuvants are solubilized by citrate ions in muscle interstitial fluid 
(Flarend et al., 1997), without any consideration of quick adjuvant cellular uptake and 
systemic long term diffusion of adjuvant agglomerates (Khan et al., 2013; Eidi et al., 2015). 
In the context of massive development of vaccine-based strategies worldwide, the present 
study may suggest that aluminium adjuvant toxicokinetics and safety require reevaluation.
