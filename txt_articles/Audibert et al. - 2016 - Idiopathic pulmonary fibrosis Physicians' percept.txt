Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare, chronic and ultimately fatal disease for which only palliative
treatments existed until recently. Between 2011 and 2015, two new drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib,
were approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of IPF, providing hope for patients. The objectives
of our work were to understand physicians' expected use of these new treatments in the US and Europe,
and to estimate their potential. To achieve this goal, we conducted surveys amongst US and European
Union (EU) pulmonologists caring for patients with IPF. There was a significant difference between EU
and US physicians in the treatment of patients with mild disease with pirfenidone; the EU physicians
anticipated using pirfenidone for 57% of their patients with mild disease, whereas the US pulmonologists
anticipated using it for 34% of their patients (p ¼ 0.01). Regarding patients with severe disease, the US
pulmonologists anticipated treating 74% with either pirfenidone (46%) or nintedanib (28%), whereas the
EU pulmonologists treated 28% with pirfenidone and anticipated treating 20% with nintedanib. These
findings suggest treatment with pirfenidone and nintedanib based on disease severity may vary between
US and EU physicians, which may affect patient outcomes.

1. Background
Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) represent a group of more than
150 disease entities, many of which are considered rare and affect
fewer than 200,000 people. The etiologies, disease progression, and
pathology of many rare ILDs have not yet been fully elucidated;
therefore, much about this group of diseases remains unknown [1].
Among the most common ILDs is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF), a chronic, progressive, irreversible and life-threatening ILD,
the mechanism of which is unknown [2]. IPF occurs in both middle-
aged and elderly adults between 40 and 70 years of age, with a
mean age of 66 years at the time of diagnosis [3]; the progression of
IPF from asymptomatic to symptomatic disease may occur over
years or decades [4]. The disease course of IPF is variable, with both
the rate of lung function decline and the eventual progression to
death taking one of several clinical forms, as follows: “slow physi-
ologic deterioration with worsening dyspnea, rapid deterioration
and progression to death, or periods of relative stability interposed
with periods of acute respiratory decline sometimes manifested by
hospitalization for respiratory failure” [5]. From the time of diag-
nosis, the median survival time among patients with IPF is two to
three years, with respiratory failure secondary to disease progres-
sion representing the most common cause of death [6]. The dis-
ease's mortality rate increases with increasing age and is higher
among men than women because of the associated higher rate of
smoking among men. The death rate is highest during the winter,
even when death resulting from infection is excluded [7]. Among
previously published studies involving patients who suffered IPF-
related deaths, the majority of patients experienced subacute
deterioration characterized by gradually worsening symptoms over
periods ranging from four weeks to several months. Additionally, a
substantial proportion of patients experienced acute deterioration
characterized by sudden disease progression over a four week
period [8,9].
1.1. IPF treatment landscape
In 2011, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the European
Respiratory Society (ERS), the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS),
and the Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) jointly pub-
lished the most recent international evidence-based guidelines
regarding the diagnosis and management of IPF at the time of our

 research [10]. Since then, the ATS, ERS, JRS and ALAT published an
update of these guidelines in July 2015 due to the availability of
new, important evidence for the treatment of IPF [11]. The 2011 IPF
diagnosis and management guidelines noted that “the preponder-
ance of evidence to date suggests that pharmacologic therapy for
IPF is without definitive, proven benefit.” Consequently, IPF is
generally considered to be unresponsive to “standard” therapies
[10]. However, the recent FDA approval of two drugs, pirfenidone
and nintedanib, is believed to represent a watershed event in the
medical management of IPF [12]. Initial pirfenidone Phase III trial
results were published in both 2010 and 2011 [13,14], and addi-
tional publications of Phase III trials involving both pirfenidone [15]
and nintedanib [16] were released in 2014.
Pirfenidone's ASCEND trial was the fourth in a series of Phase III
trials. The results of the previous three trials were mixed, which
ultimately resulted in the approval of the drug in both Japan
(October 2008) and Europe (February 2011), but not in the US. The
drug's mechanism of action is unclear, although its anti-fibrotic
mechanism is likely mediated via the inhibition of the expression
of b1, a transforming growth factor [12]. The ASCEND trial yielded
positive results, as pirfenidone facilitated a significant reduction in
the one year rate of decline of forced vital capacity (FVC) and a
reduction in the decline in the distance achieved on the 6 min walk
test; however, no effect on respiratory symptoms was noted. The
results of the ASCEND trial finally garnered FDA approval for pir-
fenidone on October 15, 2014 [17].
The INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2 trials were two randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials designed to evaluate nin-
tedanib. Nintedanib is an intracellular inhibitor that targets mul-
tiple tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor,
fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor re-
ceptors, which are believed to mediate the drug's anti-fibrotic ef-
fects [12,16]. The patients who received nintedanib experienced
significant reductions in their rates of FVC decline at one year,
which was the primary endpoint of the two studies. Yet, the
magnitude of the effect of nintedanib in terms of preventing acute
exacerbations varied between the two INPULSIS trials, and there
was no evidence of improvement in respiratory symptom scores.
Nintedanib received FDA approval on October 15, 2014 [18].
The objectives of this study were to characterize the IPF patient
population per level of severity; and to understand the potential
impact of the aforementioned newly approved drugs in the treat-
ment of patients with IPF of varying disease severity. To the best of
our knowledge, this was the first research studying physicians'
expected use per disease severity (mild, moderate and severe dis-
ease) of these newly approved drugs.
2. Methods
2.1. Study participants and design
Pulmonologists from the US and Europe (France, Germany, and
Italy) were invited to participate in an online survey aimed at un-
derstanding current management of IPF patients, and estimating
the proportion of patients that would receive pirfenidone and/or
nintedanib. In the US, the known universe of 7800 pulmonologists
from the CMS National Plan and Provider Enumeration System
(NPPES) was established as the sample frame from which all survey
recruitment was based. Given that IPF is not a commonly seen
condition across all pulmonology practices, it was assumed that
some screening of the general pulmonology universe would be
necessary to identify physicians who see a minimum number of
patients with this condition to answer the research questions in
this study. To that end, we employed a two-phased approach to
identify IPF treating pulmonologists. The first phase involved
sending mailed and email-based invitations to all 7800 pulmo-
nologists in the US inviting them to participate in an online survey
about the management of IPF. At this point, physicians voluntarily
self-screened based on knowledge, interest, and experience level in
treating this condition and had the opportunity to respond to the
survey invitation by logging in to an online survey. 173 physicians
responded during this first phase of recruitment and targeting. As it
is unknown how many physicians successfully received, reviewed,
and self-screened for this survey invitation, a true response rate
cannot be calculated for this recruitment methodology. However, it
is assumed that participation in this survey was random and rep-
resented basic interest and knowledge in this disease area. Out of
the 173 physicians who responded to the survey invitation, 132
successfully met the minimum IPF patient requirement of 5 pa-
tients currently under management, thus representing phase 2 of
the survey recruitment and targeting. These 132 physicians went
on to complete the online survey and represent the study sample of
IPF treating pulmonologists in the US.
In Europe, a sample frame of 1400 pulmonologists was estab-
lished by assembling physicians from public sources that list IPF
treating physicians and general pulmonologists such as orpha.net,
Centre de R�
ef�
erence des Maladies Pulmonaires Rares for France,
Lungenatlas for Germany and Osservatorio Malattie Rare for Italy.
Similar to the US, it was also assumed that not all pulmonologists
contained in the EU sample frame treat a minimum number of IPF
patients so an analogous targeting and screening effort was
implemented to recruit IPF treating physicians into the EU-specific
survey. This effort involved sending mailed and email-based in-
vitations to all 1400 pulmonologists contained in the sample frame
inviting them to complete an online survey on the management of
IPF. 82 responded to this invitation by completing the online
screening questions designed to target physicians who see a min-
imum of 3 IPF patients. 55 physicians successfully qualified and
completed the EU-based online survey. As was the case in the US,
we assume that participation in the EU survey was random,
voluntary, and represented basic interest and knowledge of IPF.
Both the US and EU surveys were conducted online between
May and June of 2014. Physicians were offered an industry-
standard honoraria amount for their time in completing the
questionnaire.
2.2. IPF management survey
A survey was developed to assess current and expected future
management of IPF patients. The online questionnaire used in the
study included both quantitative and qualitative questions. Quan-
titative questions covered the following topics: proportion of pa-
tients per disease severity level, diagnosis location, diagnosis
methods, number of new patients diagnosed per year, current
prescription pattern of pirfenidone per disease severity level (EU
only), awareness of data presented at a recent major medical con-
ference, and likelihood to prescribe pirfenidone and nintedanib per
disease severity level. Qualitative questions covered description of
current treatment strategy, as well as knowledge of pirfenidone
and nintedanib. As pirfenidone and nintedanib were not yet
approved in the US, US pulmonologists were required to describe
their anticipated prescription patterns for IPF before and after
reviewing data from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)
publications on the ASCEND (pirfenidone) and INPULSIS (ninteda-
nib) trials that were presented during the 2014 ATS conference in
San Diego [15,16]. In the EU, as pirfenidone was already approved at
the time of the survey, actual reported prescription pattern was
collected. Once actual pirfenidone prescription data were collected,
EU pulmonologists were also required to review the same NEJM
publications as the US pulmonologists. After reviewing these data,
C. Audibert et al. / Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications 3 (2016) 80e85
81
 the responding physicians were asked how their prescription pat-
terns for their patients would change, if at all. Both articles were
made available for the physicians to consult at any time while
answering the survey. The physicians were asked to estimate their
prescription pattern according to patient severity levels: mild,
moderate, and severe. These disease stage levels were not further
described in our survey questionnaire because these have been
well-defined in guidelines [10] and were supported as recognized
disease stages in the interviews with experts in the field that we
conducted when designing this instrument.
2.3. Data analysis
All survey data were analyzed in aggregate and the individual
identities of the survey respondents were blinded to the study
authors. The planned analyses for quantitative data were descrip-
tive and included means and percentages.
Qualitative data were analyzed thematically and coded accord-
ing to the main themes of the survey questions. Any response that
addressed multiple themes was counted as multiple comments.
Answers were coded in local language by native speakers. A code
book was designed in order to group common theme, as well as
keep any local specificity. Codes were reviewed independently by
two analysts, and any discrepancies in coding were discussed until
a consensus was found.
2.4. Ethics, consent and permissions
Data for this work were obtained through market research, and
no experiment on humans has been carried out. As such, there was
no institutional review board and/or licensing committee involved
in approving the research, and no need for informed consent from
the participants, as stated in the relevant US regulations [19]. This
survey was done in accordance with market research guidelines
such as the ones edited by CASRO and EphMRA.
2.5. Statistical analysis
To compare the US and EU physicians' prescription rates of
nintedanib and pirfenidone for patients with IPF of varying severity,
Z-tests for proportions based on two independent cluster samples
were conducted. The differences between the prescription rates of
the US and EU physicians were considered statistically significant if
the p-value for the corresponding Z-test was less than 0.05. There
were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.
2.6. Limitations
It should be noted that this survey has a number of limitations.
The questionnaire included realistic but hypothetical prescribing
scenarios, and it is not possible to ascertain whether physicians
would actually follow through with their stated intentions. As with
any survey, our findings may be influenced by both recall and
response bias of the surveyed individuals. Additionally, only a
subset of pulmonologists participated in our survey, and as with all
analyses, caution should be used when generalizing results to the
entire population. However, the response rate obtained in our
survey is in line with what could be expected for this type of survey,
especially for a rare disease such as IPF [20]. In the EU, data from
France, Germany and Italy were analyzed at the aggregate level.
Although we realize the healthcare systems from these countries
vary, those countries share the same treatment guidelines [10,11]
and thus patients should receive similar treatments in all three
EU countries.
3. Results
3.1. Physicians' practice
In the US, survey participants personally managed 36.1 IPF pa-
tients on average, while EU respondents managed a slightly lower
average of 30.5 IPF patients. Regarding the diagnosis of IPF, the 132
US pulmonologist respondents noted that 82% of their patients
were diagnosed via an HRCT scan, whereas 24% were diagnosed via
biopsy. The primary reasons for performing a biopsy highlight the
potential difficulties of establishing an IPF diagnosis: 59% of the
respondents indicated that they performed a biopsy to confirm the
diagnosis and rule out other diseases, whereas 38% indicated that
the CT scan was either atypical or difficult to interpret.
The 132 US pulmonologists indicated the current management
of patients with IPF depends on their symptoms, disease severity,
and rate of disease progression. Primary treatment strategies e
whether alone or in combination with other strategies e are
described in Table 1 and involved symptom management and
supportive care (58%), oxygen therapy (39%), and other specific
treatments, such as steroids (37%), rehabilitation therapy or exer-
cise (27%), and immunosuppressive agents (26%).
The EU and US survey respondents indicated the patients they
treated were evenly distributed across the spectrum of disease
severity, as Fig. 1 shows.
3.2. Pirfenidone use according to disease severity
The 2011 approval of pirfenidone in Europe provided an op-
portunity to compare current pirfenidone treatment trends in
Europe with anticipated treatment trends in the US. In the EU, 30%
of patients were currently receiving pirfenidone. When looking at
the proportion per disease severity, the distribution was skewed
primarily toward patients with moderate disease (51%) compared
with patients with either mild (27%) or severe (22%) disease (Fig. 2).
In the US, because pirfenidone was not yet approved at the time
of the survey, respondents were presented with ASCEND trial re-
sults, and were asked to provide their opinion on these trial data.
US respondents were optimistic about these results, with 75%
indicating they were likely to prescribe pirfenidone within six
months of its approval; 23% indicated they were somewhat likely to
prescribe the drug, and 2% indicated they were not likely to do so.
Regarding use according to disease severity level, US physicians
indicated they would most likely use pirfenidone in 44% of mod-
erate patients, compared with 24% of patients with mild disease
and 32% with severe disease (Fig. 2).
3.3. Expected use of nintedanib and pirfenidone
When comparing the expected usages of pirfenidone and nin-
tedanib, the EU pulmonologists expected to prescribe pirfenidone
more often than nintedanib. Although this was also true for the US
physicians, their overall preference for pirfenidone was not as
strong as that observed among the European physicians. Fig. 3
depicts the proportions of patients who were most likely to be
treated with either drug based on disease severity and the re-
sponses of both the US and the EU survey respondents.
Regarding pirfenidone, the EU pulmonologists expected to
prescribe pirfenidone to 57% of their patients with mild disease,
whereas the US pulmonologists expected to prescribe pirfenidone
to 34% of their mild patients (p ¼ 0.01). A similar trend was also
anticipated for patients with moderate disease, although this trend
was not statistically significant; 58% of patients with moderate
disease were expected to receive pirfenidone in Europe, compared
with 48% of patients with moderate disease in the US. For the
C. Audibert et al. / Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications 3 (2016) 80e85
82
 patients with severe disease, the opposite trend was observed, as
46% of severe patients were expected to receive pirfenidone in the
US, compared with 28% of the severe patients in Europe.
Regarding nintedanib, the EU and US pulmonologists antici-
pated treating similar proportions of patients with mild disease
(16% and 17%, respectively) and moderate disease (26% and 27%,
respectively). The US respondents expected to use nintedanib to
treat 28% of their patients with severe disease, while the EU
respondents anticipated using it to treat 20% of their patients with
severe disease.
4. Discussion
The absence of adequate treatment options for IPF management
has long plagued physicians. In 2014, the expected availability of
two new drugs with different hypothesized mechanisms of action,
encouraging efficacy data, and manageable side effect profiles
suggested that the treatment armamentarium of pulmonologists
may be strengthened significantly via the drugs' emergence. With
changes in the therapeutic landscape came the need to evaluate the
potential impact of these two new drugs, nintedanib and pirfeni-
done, on IPF management.
During our survey, participating pulmonologists were presented
with NEJM publications pertaining to the ASCEND (pirfenidone)
and INPULSIS (nintedanib) [15,16] trials, as these were the most
current and reliable sources of information pertaining to the two
drugs. As Hunninghake mentioned in his NEJM editorial, the field
should be cautious about extrapolating the findings of the INPULSIS
and ASCEND trials to patients outside the recruitment criteria for
these trials, as “the studies provide little insight into the use of
these drugs in patients with more severe disease (FVC <50% of the
predicted value) or with an acute disease exacerbation” [12].
Although there were no data supporting the use of either pirfeni-
done or nintedanib for patients with severe disease, we nonethe-
less included this patient population in our assessment, as it
represents a significant proportion of the patients with IPF.
These results identified a statistically significant difference

 between the EU and US pulmonologists in the use of pirfenidone to
treat patients with mild disease. EU respondents anticipated pre-
scribing pirfenidone for 57% of their patients with mild disease,
whereas the US pulmonologists anticipated prescribing it for only
34% of those patients (p ¼ 0.01). Additionally, for the patients with
severe disease, the US pulmonologists anticipated treating a total of
74% of these patients with either pirfenidone (46%) or nintedanib
(28%), whereas the EU pulmonologists anticipated treating a total of
48% of their patients with either pirfenidone (28%) or nintedanib
(20%). These differences may exist for several reasons. First, pirfe-
nidone was not indicated for patients with severe disease in Europe
at the time of the survey (pirfenidone was still not indicated for
severe patients at the time of this article's submission). Conse-
quently, the EU pulmonologists may have been less likely to treat
patients with severe disease with pirfenidone and less likely to
anticipate treating a large proportion of said patients with ninte-
danib. Second, because pirfenidone was approved by the EMA in
2011, the EU pulmonologists had the opportunity for first-hand
experience in using the drug and may have observed better out-
comes among patients with either mild or moderate IPF. Third, the
observation that US physicians anticipated treating a higher pro-
portion of patients with severe IPF may reflect a more aggressive
approach by US physicians to the treatment of severely ill patients
compared with EU physicians. Fourth, the likelihood of off-label use
to treat patients with severe IPF may differ between US and EU
physicians.
The results of our survey also indicate pirfenidone appears to be
the preferred agent across the entire spectrum of disease severity.
This may be because pirfenidone was already being used in Europe
at the time of the survey, and EU doctors may have been less willing
to transition their patients to nintedanib. In the US, the observed
preference for pirfenidone may be attributed to the increased
awareness of pirfenidone because of its development history. Pir-
fenidone's New Drug Application (NDA) was first submitted to the
FDA in November 2009, whereas nintedanib's NDA was submitted
to the FDA in May 2014.
Another critical dimension of the management of IPF is the
establishment of disease severity after diagnosis. The complex na-
ture of IPF in combination with the variability of the disease's
course complicates both its diagnosis and its treatment. The ATS,
ERS, JRS, and ALAT clinical practice guidelines published in 2011
recommend the use of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnose
IPF; however, the use of a multidisciplinary approach is not always
feasible, and there likely exists some degree of variability in both
the diagnosis and the treatment of patients with IPF in clinical
practice [10]. Despite these guidelines, the division of IPF cases
based on disease severity remains both challenging and somewhat
subjective. In our survey, 59% of the US respondents indicated that
they performed a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other
diseases, whereas 38% indicated that CT scans were either atypical
or difficult to interpret. These findings emphasize the challenges of
establishing a diagnosis and determining the disease's severity.
Because both pirfenidone and nintedanib are now approved in
Europe and the US, patients and physicians have treatment options
for a rare disease for which there were previously no approved
treatments. Accordingly, the 2011 ATS, ERS, JRS, and ALAT clinical
practice guidelines were updated in 2015 to provide recommen-
dations on pirfenidone and nintedanib use, amongst other treat-
ment
[11].
The
revised
guidelines
provide
a
positive
recommendation on the use of these two new drugs. However, the
use of these drugs and their impact on diagnosis and disease
severity remain to be seen, underscoring the need for additional
research studies to improve both the understanding and the
management of IPF.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the availability of these two agents has provided
clinicians with hope for halting disease progression and has given
them additional tools with which to manage this complex disease.
However, the true impact of these drugs on patient diagnosis,
management, and survival remains unclear until long-term, real
world data becomes available.
