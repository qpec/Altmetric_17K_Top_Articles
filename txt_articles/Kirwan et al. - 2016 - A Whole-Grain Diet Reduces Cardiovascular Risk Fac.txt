Abstract
Background: Increased dietary whole-grain intake may protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Objective: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of whole grains compared with refined grains on body composition,
hypertension, and related mediators of CVD in overweight and obese adults.
Methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover trial in 40 overweight or obese men and
women aged <50 y with no known history of CVD. Complete whole-grain and refined-grain diets were provided for two
8-wk periods, with a 10-wk washout between diets. Macronutrient composition was matched, except for the inclusion of
either whole grains or refined grains (50 g/1000 kcal in each diet). Measurements included blood pressure, body
composition, blood lipids and adiponectin, and markers of inflammation and glycemia.
Results: Thirty-three participants (6 men and 27 women) completed the trial [mean 6 SD age 39 6 7 y, mean 6 SD body
mass index (in kg/m2) 33.1 6 4.3]. Decreases in diastolic blood pressure were 25.8 mm Hg (95% CI: 27.7, 24.0 mm Hg)
after the whole-grain diet and 21.6 mm Hg (95% CI: 24.4, 1.3 mm Hg) after the control diet (between effect, P = 0.01).
Decreases in plasma adiponectin were 20.1 (95% CI: 20.9, 0.7) after the whole-grain diet and 21.4 (95% CI: 22.6, 20.3)
after the control diet (between effect, P = 0.05). Decreases in diastolic blood pressure correlated with the circulating
adiponectin concentration (r = 0.35, P = 0.04). Substantial reductions in body weight, fat loss, systolic blood pressure, total
cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol were observed during both diet periods, with no relevant difference between them.
Conclusions: The improvement in diastolic blood pressure was >3-fold greater in overweight and obese adults when they consumed
a whole-grain compared with a refined-grain diet. Because diastolic blood pressure predicts mortality in adults aged <50 y, increased
whole-grain intake may provide a functional approach to control hypertension. This may benefit patients at risk of vascular-related
morbidity and mortality. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01411540.

Introduction
Overweight and obesity are global health problems that continue
to expand in scope and severity (1) and place ever-increasing
demands on health care systems worldwide. Hypertension is
a common obesity comorbidity, which affects ;78 million US
adults, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)9,
and is particularly insidious because it often has no symptoms. It
is notable that hypertension may have age-dependent links to
CVD risk: before age 50 y elevated diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) is associated with increased disease risk; after age 50 y
elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) appears to be the more

 important risk factor (2). In the United States, CVD accounts
for 32% of all deaths, at an annual cost of $313 billion (3);
globally, the burden of CVD is enormous, contributing to nearly
20 million deaths/y in men and women >40 y of age (4).
Although the prevalence and impact of CVD have declined in
most economically advanced countries, increases in obesity
threaten this progress. Strategies targeting obesity and prevent-
able CVD risk factors including hypertension are urgently
needed.
Nutrition and the management of overweight and obesity are
central features in all clinical practice guidelines for reducing
CVD risk (5). Diets that are rich in whole grains are associated
with a decreased risk of many diseases and conditions, including
CVD, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and mortality (6–10).
Studies of whole-grain diet interventions have shown reductions
in LDL cholesterol (11, 12) and have linked whole-grain intake
with reduced inflammation (13). Although studies suggest that
whole grains may lower blood pressure, fasting glucose, choles-
terol, and inflammation (11, 14–17), some intervention studies
have not confirmed these results, even when they have examined
high doses of whole grains (up to 120 g/d) (18, 19). Furthermore,
a lack of adequate control over intervention diets may explain
why some trials with whole grains have not reported improve-
ments in markers of disease risk. To address this issue, we
provided the entire diet for each intervention arm and evaluated
the effect of a comprehensively controlled whole-grain diet on key
clinical outcomes and biomarkers related to CVD in overweight
and obese adults. To ensure that subjects complied with the diet,
we measured plasma alkylresorcinols. Alkylresorcinols are phe-
nolic lipids present in high amounts in whole-grain wheat and rye.
Because they are absorbed well by humans and can be measured
in plasma, they are commonly used as biomarkers of whole-grain
wheat and rye intake (20). To explore recent hypotheses that
glycine betaine (betaine) from whole-grain wheat may make a
mechanistic contribution to the health effects of whole grains via
the effects on one-carbon metabolism (21, 22), we also measured
betaine and related one-carbon metabolites (23–25).
Here, we provide the empirical data from a randomized
crossover study of overweight and obese adults that compared
the effects of a diet containing whole grains with an energy-
matched diet using refined grains on body composition and
metabolism. We hypothesized that a diet supplemented with
whole grains would result in a greater change in body compo-
sition and obesity-related CVD risk factors.
Methods
Design
We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover study of
2 fully provisioned diets: a whole-grain (intervention) diet and a refined-
grain (control) diet. The study design facilitated examining the within-
diet effect as well as the between-diet effects. The study was approved by
the institutional review board of the Cleveland Clinic and was registered
at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01411540.
Population
Overweight and obese adults from the Cleveland, Ohio, area were
recruited via advertisements. Our inclusion criteria were nonsmoking,
<50 y of age, stable weight (<2-kg weight gain or loss in prior 6 mo),
physically inactive (<1 h/wk), and BMI (in kg/m2) 28–40. Participants
were excluded if they were diagnosed as having chronic disease (e.g.,
renal, hepatic, CVD, type 2 diabetes) or were taking lipid-lowering medica-
tions, including statins. Participants taking antihypertensive medications
could be enrolled. Women were to be premenopausal and studied during
the midfollicular phase (i.e., 5–10 d postmenses). All of the participants
underwent medical examinations, including resting electrocardiogram,
urinalysis, and blood biochemistry. Participants were briefed verbally
about the study and signed informed consent documents approved by the
Cleveland Clinic institutional review board.
Randomization and blinding
Patients were randomly assigned to diet groups before testing. Blinding
was achieved by covering whole-grain foods with sauce and by packaging
meals into identical containers so that entrees appeared similar for both
diets. Entrees were assembled at the Nestl´
e Product Technology Center in
Solon, Ohio.
Intervention
Participants were provided all of their food and fluids during both diet
periods. The macronutrient composition of each diet was matched, except
for the inclusion of either whole grains or refined grains (50 g/1000 kcal in
each diet; Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1). All recipes were identical
for the 2 diets, except that entrees, breakfast cereals, and cereal bars
differed in whole-grain or refined-grain content. The main cereals used
were wheat (57%), rice (21%), and oats (16%). The target whole-grain
amount was designed to be easily achievable on a controlled diet and at
the higher range of whole-grain intake recommended by the USDA. Cereal
foods were selected for the study on the basis that they would be familiar
and palatable to the study population.
Each diet period lasted 8 wk with a 10-wk washout period between
diets. During washout, participants were instructed to resume their usual
eating patterns. Diets were energy matched and isocaloric to each
individual�s daily requirements (measured resting metabolic rate 3 1.3
activity factor). The resting metabolic rate was determined before the
start of each diet by using a ventilated hood and indirect calorimetry
(Vmax Encore, Viasys) (26). Dietary compliance was estimated by
weekly weigh-backs of food containers and calculated as the percentage
of difference between prescribed and actual caloric intake.
At the beginning and end of each diet period, participants spent 3 d in
our clinical research unit for metabolic testing. Plasma alkylresorcinols,
which are objective biomarkers of whole-grain intake (20), were measured
to confirm compliance with the diet. Diet analysis was performed using
the Food Processor Nutritional Analysis Pro version 10.80 (ESHA
Research). During their inpatient stay, participants were provided all
meals and instructed to avoid strenuous activity.
Outcome measures
Body composition. Height and weight were obtained with partici-
pants wearing a standard hospital gown and by use of a wall-mounted

 stadiometer and a calibrated scale. BMI was calculated as body mass
(kilograms) divided by the square of height (meters). Total body fat
(percentage), fat mass, and fat-free mass were assessed using dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometry (iDXA, Lunar Prodigy; GE Healthcare). Waist
circumference was measured up to 3 times with the use of a plastic tape
measure ;2 cm above the umbilicus. Measurements within 0.5 cm were
averaged and used for analysis.
Blood pressure. Participants slept overnight in the clinical research
unit. On the third morning, research nurses used an automated platform
(DINAMAPProcare 400; GE Medical Systems) to obtain morning
brachial SBP and DBP measurements, which were performed on the left
arm in a lowly lighted room while participants lay semisupine after
10 min of awake rest. Reported data were based on the mean of 3
measurements, with 1 min between each measurement. Mean arterial
pressure was calculated as 2/3(DBP) + 1/3(SBP). Pulse pressure was
estimated by subtracting DBP from SBP.
Cardiovascular risk assessment. A polyethylene catheter was inserted
into an antecubital vein and fasting blood samples were obtained for the
determination of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); insulin; liver enzymes;
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP); total adiponectin; plasma
glucose; TGs; and total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, VLDL
cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. Homocysteine, betaine, choline,
and N-N-dimethylglycine (DMG) were also determined to characterize
intermediate metabolites of cholesterol metabolism. Sex-specific z scores
were calculated to determine the efficacy of each diet on decreasing the
severity of the metabolic syndrome (27). The National Cholesterol
Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria for the
metabolic syndrome also were calculated based on the sum of risk
factors for the syndrome. Insulin resistance was estimated by use of the
HOMA-IR, as described elsewhere (27).
Biochemical analyses. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and
after completing each diet period. We measured plasma glucose imme-
diately after collection using the glucose-oxidase method (YSI 2300 STAT
Plus). HbA1c was measured in whole blood by turbidimetric inhibition
immunoassay (Cleveland Clinic Laboratories). Alanine transaminase and
aspartate transaminase (AST) also were assessed to characterize liver
inflammation or injury (28). The remaining blood was centrifuged at 4�C
for 10 min and frozen at 270�C until subsequent analysis.
To minimize interassay variability, all of the frozen samples from
preintervention and postintervention collections were analyzed in the same
assay. Homocysteine was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (Dionex) with the use of a commercial kit. Betaine, choline, DMG,
and carnitine were analyzed by isotope dilution with high-performance
liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (22). Plasma
alkylresorcinols were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to a mass
spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) (29). Plasma total adiponectin concen-
tration was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biovendor
Laboratory Medicine Inc.). Plasma TGs and cholesterol were analyzed with
the use of enzymatic methods with an automated platform (Roche Modular
Diagnostics). Plasma hs-CRP was measured with an automated analyzer
(Dimension EXL 2000; Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic Inc.). Plasma insulin
was assayed by radioimmunoassay (EMD Millipore).
Data analysis
We assessed the data using R software, Mavericks build 6913, version
3.1.3 (R Foundation). ANOVA with linear mixed effects was used to
compare baseline characteristics and detect between-diet differences
(i.e., D of postintervention to preintervention) with order and period
effects added to the model. Although there were no pretest differences
between diets, suggesting that there was no carryover effect, we analyzed
the treatment 3 period interaction to confirm that there was no
carryover effect (data not shown), and results are reported as treatment
effect for ease of interpretation. Results between diets were further
adjusted for age, sex, change in body fat, dietary fiber, and baseline
concentrations. Within-diet effects were assessed using paired t tests.
Non-normally distributed data were log transformed for analysis. Pearson�s
product-moment correlation was used to examine the associations between
physiologic characteristics using D-D (i.e., whole-group) condition
values. Significance was set at P < 0.05, and data were reported as
means, SDs, and CIs.
Results
Forty overweight or obese adults with a mean age of 40 6 7 y
were enrolled. Seven participants dropped out (Figure 1), so 33
subjects completed the trial. Participants taking antihypertensive
medication (n = 5) were instructed to maintain medication usage
throughout the study.
Diet.
Diet compliance based on weigh-backs was comparable
in both arms [94.6% 6 6.4% (whole grain) compared with
92.9% 6 5.7% (refined grain); P = 0.18]. As expected, whole-
grain (between effect, P < 0.001) and total fiber consumption
(between effect, P < 0.001; Table 1) were higher during the whole-
grain arm than during the control, refined-grain arm. There was a
slightly smaller intake of saturated fat with the whole-grain diet
(between effect, P = 0.03; Table 1). Also, plasma alkylresorcinols
were not different at baseline for either diet arm, but they
measured significantly higher after whole-grain intake (between
effect, P < 0.001; Table 2).
Body weight and composition. Both diets induced 3% and
6% weight loss and fat loss, respectively (within effect, P <
0.001; Table 2), with no significant difference between diets.
Both diets also promoted similar reductions in waist circumfer-
ence and fat-free mass (;2 cm and ;0.6 kg, respectively; Table 2).
Blood pressure. Although both diets lowered SBP, there were no
significant differences in the magnitude of reduction between
interventions (between effect, P = 0.80, Figure 2). Whole grains
lowered DBP by ;8% (compared with 1% for refined grains;
P = 0.01; Figure 2), however. This change in DBP translated to a
10% improvement in pulse pressure (Table 2). After adjustment for
changes in body fat, age, sex, dietary fiber, and baseline variables,
improvements in both DBP and pulse pressure remained significant.
Blood lipids, glycemic control, and insulin resistance.
There were no significant differences in lipid or glycemic risk
factors between the diets. Both diets significantly reduced TC and
LDL cholesterol by ;9–20% (Table 2). Each diet comparably
reduced HOMA-IR, but only whole grains significantly lowered
HbA1c and fasting plasma insulin concentrations (Table 2).
Moreover, although participants presented with few ATP III
criteria (i.e., number of risk factors) for the metabolic syndrome
before each diet intervention (1.6 6 1.2 compared with 1.4 6 1.1,
P = 0.29) and neither diet greatly reduced the number of ATP III
criteria (20.2 6 1.0 compared with 0.6 6 1.0, P = 0.18), only the
whole-grain intervention reduced metabolic syndrome severity
(i.e., z score calculation; P = 0.04; Table 2).
Adiponectin, hs-CRP, liver enzymes, and one-carbon
metabolites. Whole-grain intake preserved circulating total
adiponectin concentrations compared with an ;10% decline
after refined-grain intake, independent of changes in body fat,
baseline age, sex, and dietary fiber (P = 0.02; Figure 3A, B).
There was no between-trial effect on hs-CRP, alanine transam-
inase, AST, or one-carbon metabolites (Table 2).

Postintervention, adiponectin corre-
lated with reductions in body fat (Figure 3C) and DBP (Figure

 adiponectin also significantly correlated with changes in AST
(r = 0.33, P = 0.05) and betaine (r = 0.44, P = 0.009). Changes in
betaine significantly correlated with changes in HOMA-IR
(r = 0.54, P = 0.001) and DMG (r = 0.51, P = 0.002). DMG
significantly correlated with TC (r = 0.35, P = 0.04), LDL
cholesterol (r = 0.37, P = 0.03), and carnitine (r = 0.39, P = 0.02).
Moreover, lower fasting insulin concentration significantly
correlated with reductions in both body weight and body fat
(both r = 20.46, P = 0.008).
Discussion
We evaluated the effects of a whole-grain diet on CVD and
metabolic syndrome risk factors in overweight and obese adults
<50 y of age. Compared with a control, refined-grain diet, the
whole-grain diet reduced DBP by 5.8 mm Hg, or an additional
4.2 mm Hg beyond any change attributable to weight loss. In
population studies this improvement approximates to a 40%
lower risk of dying from stroke and a 30% lower risk of dying
from ischemic heart disease or other vascular causes (30).
Because increased DBP was the primary risk factor for CVD in
the study population—adults aged <50 y—these findings have
important implications for both patient care and public health.
The worldwide prevalence of hypertension in adults and
children has increased in parallel with the pandemic of obesity.
Many individuals with hypertension remain undiagnosed, mak-
ing treatment and remission challenging. Lifestyle changes
including diet and exercise are recommended first-line treatments
for prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension, and even modest
weight loss benefits individuals (31–33). Although the evidence is
limited, the consumption of more whole-grain foods has been
associated with reduced CVD risk, including reductions in SBP in
older adults (34–38). Participants in our study represent a
relatively young group at high risk for developing debilitating,
complex, and long-term complications associated with obesity,
such as hypertension and CVD. The ability of the whole-grain diet
to attenuate blood pressure—particularly DBP—opens an impor-
tant clinically relevant therapeutic direction for improving health
over and above improvements resulting from weight loss.
There are few detailed mechanistic studies using randomized
prospective study designs. A comprehensive meta-analysis by Ye
and colleagues (39) concluded that although the evidence to
support a link between whole grain intake and reduced CVD risk,
including lower hypertension and blood lipids, is strong, a major
gap exists in our knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie the
benefits of whole-grain intake. A recent study by Jenkins et al. (40)
suggests that one potential mechanism linking whole-grain intake
to hypertension may work through increased vascular reactivity.
Data also support the suggestion that whole grain–induced
lowering of DBP may be mediated through enhanced endothelial
function. Intriguing data from the Coronary Artery Risk Develop-
ment in Young Adults (commonly known as CARDIA) study (41)
showed that a diet that includes high intake of whole-grain foods
has a strong inverse association with specific cellular-adhesion
molecules that indicate endothelial dysfunction and subclinical
CVD. Consistent with these studies, we noted a significant
correlation between plasma adiponectin and DBP in our sample.
Adiponectin, a 244–amino acid peptide secreted from adipocytes,
protects against metabolic diseases and CVD (42, 43). Low plasma
adiponectin concentrations are common in obesity and coronary
artery disease and are associated with increased hypertension and
impaired vasoreactivity (44, 45). In our study, systemic adiponectin
concentrations were maintained when the diet was enriched with
whole grains, but they declined when whole grains were absent,
which was all the more remarkable because weight loss and fat
loss were similar in both diets. Dietary whole-grain intake and
adiponectin have been associated before (46), and together support
the view that diets enriched with whole grains may be linked to
hypertension and CVD through an anti-inflammatory–related
mechanism. The active compound or compounds that contribute
to blood-pressure regulation within the whole-grain diet remains to
be discovered, but it does not appear to be any of the one-carbon
metabolites that we measured in this study.
In epidemiological studies, dietary whole grains were asso-
ciated with a reduced risk of stroke, and the effect appears to be
independent of fiber intake (47). In the case of CVD, data suggest
a lowering of circulating lipids, particularly cholesterol (12, 14,
39, 48), although a recent meta-analysis (49) found that a reduction

 in blood lipids was consistently associated only with whole-
grain oats, not other cereals. The main grains we used in this
study were wheat and rice. Because TC, VLDL cholesterol, and
LDL cholesterol were significantly reduced in both diets, we
cannot conclude that the improved lipid profile in our partic-
ipants was the exclusive domain of whole grains. We suspect
that the improvements stemmed from the controlled nature of
the dietary intervention and the resultant weight loss.
Modest weight loss during controlled feeding studies is not
unusual. In our experience, this is because snacking and
consuming the extra calories that are common in food-rich
environments is minimized; this observation is supported by
published reports (50, 51). Most studies that have examined
whole-grain foods allow participants to remain in ‘‘free-living’’
environments, where whole-grain foods are provided in their
usual diets. This approach can lead to participants adding—
instead of substituting—the study foods to their diet, leading to
higher overall energy intake, which mitigates any benefit gained
from the added whole-grain foods (13). This factor may have been
at play in studies in which no effect of eating more whole-grain
foods was observed (18, 19). In contrast, studies reporting a
lowering of risk factors related to CVD have been tightly controlled
crossover studies with all foods provided (11, 14, 15, 35).
Because of the length of the study, we had concerns about
compliance. As a nonsubjective measure of compliance, we
measured plasma alkylresorcinols, which correlate with whole-
grain intake (20), and have been used as compliance biomarkers in
several whole-grain intervention studies (12, 52, 53). Alkylresorcinols
are found almost exclusively in the outer layers of wheat, rye, and
barley (54); are absorbed; and can be measured in plasma (55).
Plasma alkylresorcinols substantially increased during the whole-
grain intervention, indicating excellent overall compliance.
The USDA recommends that Americans eat $48 g whole
grains/d, as part of their six 1-ounce servings of cereal-based
foods. No upper limit for whole-grain intake is given, although
the 100 g/2000 kcal provided during this study is substantially

 higher than average intakes reported in the United States
(<16 g/d) (56). Because we observed no differences in compliance
or preference for either diet (although participants were blinded),
100 g whole grains/2000 kcal was easily achievable in this
population. Our experience is consistent with several studies that
have substantially increased whole-grain intake in populations
with habitually low whole-grain intake (12, 57). More important,
the foods we used in this study were based on commercially
available ingredients and recipes and were well accepted by the
participants.
The limitations of our study include sample size, which
although large for a dietary study of this kind, was moderate in
the context of clinical intervention trials. The design is similar to
a crossover study design, which allowed tight individual control
and minimized intersubject variance. This design is similar but
superior to 66 subjects in a between-group design. In addition,

 our study population included mainly women, which may limit
generalization of the results to the population as a whole. Moreover,
we recognize that adjustments were not made for multiple compar-
isons. There was no particular subset of analyses for which we
desired to control an overall type I error rate; therefore, the results of
all of the statistical tests were judged individually for significance at
the 0.05 level. The probability of a type I error is 5% in each case
that a null hypothesis is true, and individual significant results
should be understood in that context. Lastly, despite instructions to
consume dietary foods provided during the study, it remains possible
that subjects consumed foods of which we were not aware and our
estimation of caloric intake underestimates true nutrition.
The strengths of our study include the rigorous control of diet
in an outpatient setting, and the pivotal observation that whole
grains attenuate a key CVD risk factor in a high-risk segment of
the population. These data build on strong observational
evidence that whole grains are an important dietary adjunct
for the prevention and treatment of hypertension, even in people
already at risk of CVD-related complications.
In summary, a diet based on whole grains reduced multiple
risk factors for CVD and selectively decreased DBP in over-
weight and obese adults <50 y of age. The improvement in DBP
was independent of weight loss or fat loss. Our results suggest
that whole grains may be a key nutrient regulator of hyperten-
sion and could provide an effective nutritional strategy to lower
CVD-related morbidity and mortality.
