Summary
Background Pretreatment drug resistance in people initiating or re-initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing 
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) might compromise HIV control in low-income and middle-
income countries (LMICs). We aimed to assess the scale of this problem and whether it is associated with the intiation 
or re-initiation of ART in people who have had previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs.
Methods This study was a systematic review and meta-regression analysis. We assessed regional prevalence of 
pretreatment drug resistance and risk of pretreatment drug resistance in people initiating ART who reported previous 
ART exposure. We systematically screened publications and unpublished datasets for pretreatment drug-resistance 
data in individuals in LMICs initiating or re-initiating first-line ART from LMICs. We searched for studies in PubMed 
and Embase and conference abstracts and presentations from the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic 
Infections, the International AIDS Society Conference, and the International Drug Resistance Workshop for the 
period Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2016. To assess the prevalence of drug resistance within a specified region at any specific 
timepoint, we extracted study level data and pooled prevalence estimates within the region using an empty logistic 
regression model with a random effect at the study level. We used random effects meta-regression to relate sampling 
year to prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance within geographical regions. 
Findings We identified 358 datasets that contributed data to our analyses, representing 56 044 adults in 63 countries. 
Prevalence estimates of pretreatment NNRTI resistance in 2016 were 11·0% (7·5–15·9) in southern Africa, 10·1% 
(5·1–19·4) in eastern Africa, 7·2% (2·9–16·5) in western and central Africa, and 9·4% (6·6–13·2) in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. There were substantial increases in pretreatment NNRTI resistance per year in all regions. The 
yearly increases in the odds of pretreatment drug resistance were 23% (95% CI 16–29) in southern Africa, 17% (5–30) in 
eastern Africa, 17% (6–29) in western and central Africa, 11% (5–18) in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 
11% (2–20) in Asia. Estimated increases in the absolute prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance between 
2015 and 2016 ranged from 0·3% in Asia to 1·8% in southern Africa. 
Interpretation Pretreatment drug resistance is increasing at substantial rate in LMICs, especially in sub-Saharan 
Africa. In 2016, the prevalence of pretreatment NNRTI resistance was near WHO’s 10% threshold for changing first-
line ART in southern and eastern Africa and Latin America, underscoring the need for routine national HIV drug-
resistance surveillance and review of national policies for first-line ART regimen composition.

Introduction
The scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the 
treatment of HIV has reached 19·5 million individuals 
globally and is an unprecedented public health 
achievement.1 Despite this accomplishment, millions 
more people with HIV need to initiate and be maintained 
on ART for life. WHO and UNAIDS have set ambitious 
targets to end the AIDS epidemic as a public health 
threat by 2030. These widely adopted targets reflect the 
global community’s commitment to expanding access to 
ART and are aiming, by 2020, to diagnose 90% of all 
people with HIV infection, provide treatment to 90% of 
those diagnosed, and ensure that 90% of people on 
treatment achieve virological suppression.2 As ART scale-
up proceeds, some degree of HIV drug resistance is 
anticipated and will have to be managed. Should the 
prevalence of HIV drug resistance in people starting 
treatment rise to substantial levels, global efforts to

achieve the so-called third 90 might be in danger, thereby 
warranting policy and guideline changes.
In 2010, WHO reported that prevalence estimates for 
HIV 
resistance 
to 
the 
non-nucleoside 
reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) backbone of first-line 
ART reached 5·5% in low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs).3 Currently, global HIV treatment 
guidelines recommend first-line ART based on the 
NNRTI efavirenz in combination with two nucleoside 
reverse 
transcriptase 
inhibitors 
(NRTIs), 
usually 
tenofovir and either lamivudine or emtricitabine.4 A 2015 
systematic review and meta-analysis reported that 20% of 
adults receiving ART for 12–60 months in LMICs had 
unsuppressed viral loads.5 Among people with treatment 
failure on ART, between 70% and 90% have drug-
resistant virus, with most resistance to the NNRTI drug 
class.6–8 Transmission of drug-resistant virus to newly 
infected people has been identified as a key challenge9 
and is particularly relevant given the increased risk of 
treatment failure in people who have NNRTI resistance 
and who start an NNRTI-based ART regimen.10–12
With ART becoming increasingly available in LMICs, 
an increasing number of people initiating NNRTI-
containing ART are not actually antiretroviral-naive but 
instead have disclosed or undisclosed previous exposure 
to antiretroviral drugs resulting from treatment for the 
prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV or 
previous disengagement from care.13 In nationally 
representative surveys of HIV drug resistance, the 
proportion of people self-reporting previous exposure to 
antiretroviral drugs at the time of re-initiating NNRTI-
based ART was high.13 In a large study from South 
Africa, 24% of the 326 first-line ART initiators reported 
previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs.14 Previous use 
of antiretroviral drugs before ART initiation is becoming 
increasingly recognised as problematic in LMICs 
because individuals with previous antiretroviral drug 
exposure are at high risk of having HIV drug resistance7,15 
and when initiating or re-initiating an NNRTI-containing 
first-line ART regimen, might be more at risk of 
treatment failure.
The 2016 WHO consolidated guidelines on the use of 
antiretroviral drugs for the treatment and prevention of 
HIV infection recommend an NNRTI-based regimen for 
all populations starting or restarting ART, regardless of 
previous use of antiretroviral drugs, except in children 
younger than 3 years.4 Most LMICs do not differentiate 
between people initiating or re-initiating first-line ART 
and thus do not take the risk of resistance due to previous 
exposure into consideration when making treatment 
recommendations as the same NNRTI-based regimen is 
offered to both initiators and re-initiators. Although 
previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs is likely to be 
associated with HIV drug resistance, no systematic 
assessment of the risk of resistance and treatment 
outcomes in this population has been done.
Unchecked emergence of HIV drug resistance could 
have real world consequences: modelling suggests that, 
where the population prevalence of HIV drug resistance 
in people initiating or re-initiating ART (pretreatment 
drug resistance) exceeds 10%, resistant virus could result 
in 890 000 deaths due to AIDS and 450000 new infections 
in sub-Saharan Africa alone during the period 2016–30 if 
no action is taken and NNRTIs continue to be used in 
first-line ART.16 To counter this threat, in July, 2017, WHO 
released guidelines on the public health response to 
pretreatment drug resistance for countries reporting 
high (>10%) prevalence of pretreatment resistance to 
NNRTIs among people starting or restarting first-line 
ART.17 Assessment of recent levels and trends of 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for meta-analyses of pretreatment HIV-1 
drug resistance over time in adults starting antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) in low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMICs), published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. We 
limited our search to studies published between Jan 1, 2012, 
and Aug 31, 2017, because we were interested in contemporary 
trends and prevalence estimates for drug resistance. We used 
the search terms “HIV” AND “transmitted HIV drug resistance” 
AND “systematic review”; “HIV” AND “pretreatment drug 
resistance” AND “systematic review”; “HIV” AND “transmitted 
drug resistance’’ AND “meta-analysis’’; “HIV” AND 
“pretreatment drug resistance’’ AND “meta-analysis’’. We did 
not identify any such studies in adults.
Added value of this study
Our findings provide up-to-date estimates of the prevalence of 
HIV drug resistance in people initiating or re-initiating first-line 
ART and we found worrying increases in prevalence in all 
regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the 
Caribbean. The prevalence of HIV drug resistance seems to be 
10% or higher in several regions and was much higher in studies 
in which individuals reported previous antiretroviral exposure. 
We also noted an increase in virological failure after first-line 
ART in individuals who reported previous antiviral exposure.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results show that some LMICs might be reaching WHO’s 
10% threshold for changing first-line non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART to integrase 
inhibitor-based ART. Individuals with previous ART exposure 
should be identified and NNRTI-based regimens should be 
avoided in this group.

pretreatment drug resistance in LMICs is therefore 
crucial in the global response to HIV
/AIDS. We did this 
study to help fill this knowledge gap. 
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
This study was a systematic review and meta-regression 
analysis of the regional prevalence of pretreatment drug 
resistance and risk of pretreatment istance among ART 
initiators reporting previous ART exposure. We searched 
for studies in PubMed and Embase and conference 
abstracts and presentations from the Conference on 
Retroviruses 
and 
Opportunistic 
Infections, 
the 
International AIDS Society Conference, and the 
International Drug Resistance Workshop for the period 
Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2016. We supplemented the 
systematic review with additional unpublished datasets 
from WHO-supported surveys of drug resistance.
We searched for studies in adults (aged >15 years) 
infected with HIV who were eligible to initiate first-line 
NNRTI-based ART in LMICs in the WHO-defined 
regions western Pacific, southeast Asia, Africa, eastern 
Mediterranean, and Latin America and the Caribbean. 
For the purpose of this analysis, countries in the southeast 
Asia, western Pacific region, eastern Mediterranean 
regions, as well as Turkey (Europe region) are grouped 
under the regional heading of “Asia”. We analysed data 
within subregions of sub-Saharan Africa: eastern Africa, 
southern Africa, and west and central Africa. Because we 
included studies from only resource-limited settings, we 
used the search term “Latin America and the Caribbean” 
instead of the “Americas”. We excluded studies with fewer 
than ten HIV-1 genotypes. We used the search terms 
“antiretroviral 
therapy” 
AND 
“transmitted 
drug 
resistance”; “antiretroviral therapy” AND “pretreatment 
drug resistance”; “antiretroviral therapy” AND “(stavudine 
OR zidovudine OR nevirapine OR efavirenz)”; “HIV” 
AND “transmitted drug resistance”; “antiretroviral 
therapy” AND “(stavudine OR zidovudine OR nevirapine 
OR efavirenz)”; “HIV” AND “pretreatment drug 
resistance”; “HIV” AND “antenatal; “HIV” AND “VCT”; 
“genotyp*” AND “HIV” AND “naive”; “genotyp*” AND 
“HIV” AND “resistance”; and “genotyp*” AND “HIV” 
AND “resistance” AND “primary”, with the search 
restricted to records in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. 
We did not contact study authors for unavailable data.
The following study-level data were extracted from 
each study: country, year of sample collection, sex, risk 
groups, setting, pretreatment CD4 cell count, number of 
pretreatment genotypes reported in the study, and 
exposure to antiretroviral drugs prior to treatment 
initiation (yes, no, or unknown). Additionally, the 
number of people with more than one drug-resistance 
mutation, one or more NRTI mutations, one or more 
thymidine analogue mutations, one or more NNRTI 
mutations, and one or more protease inhibitor mutations 
were extracted. When individual sequences were made 
available for analysis, drug resistance-mutations were 
defined as those appearing on the 2009 WHO surveillance 
drug resistance-mutations list.18 In all other cases, study 
authors’ interpretations of HIV drug resistance based on 
the Stanford HIVdb algorithm, International Antiviral 
Society-USA mutations list, and the Agence autonome 
de l’Inserm algorithms mutations list were used. RKG 
JGr RK and TC did the searches and data extraction. 
Conflicts over inclusion were decided by RKG.
Data analysis
The two major aims of our study were to characterise 
changes in drug resistance over time and to compare the 
prevalence of drug resistance in people restarting ART after 
reported previous antiretroviral exposure versus treatment-
naive patients. We also assessed whether factors including 
sex, CD4 cell count, rural or urban setting, or risk groups 
were predictors of HIV drug resistance in any geographical 
region. We therefore extracted information on drug 
resistance separately for each calendar year, treating each 
year as a separate datapoint in our analyses. We extracted 
information separately for patients before treatment 
initiation with and without prior exposure (reported or 
unreported) to antiretroviral drugs in studies where this 
information was available. The database was manually 
scanned for duplicates by JGr, NP and RKG. Where there 
were 
duplicate 
publications, 
the 
publication 
with 
information on the largest number of genotypes was used. 
Statistical analysis was done in Stata version 14.1. To 
assess the prevalence of drug resistance within a specified 
region at any specific timepoint, we pooled prevalence 
estimates within the region using an empty logistic 
regression model with a random effect at the study level 
(appendix pp 20, 21). We did not formally assess study 
quality.
To assess associations between study-level characteristics 
(eg, calendar year at the midpoint of the study year) and 
drug resistance, we used uni 
variate meta-regression 
analyses within each region (appendix pp 20, 21). We also 
explored the prevalence of specific drug-resistance 
mutations among all individuals with any WHO 
surveillance drug-resistance mutations. We calculated the 
proportion with specific mutations after crudely pooling 
the numbers of individuals with any mutation and the 
number with specific mutations. Heterogeneity was 
assessed using the I² statistic.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. RKG had full access to all the data in the study 
and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.

excluded on the basis of our eligibility criteria. We 
included 358 datasets in our analysis, which represented 
56 044 adults with data on HIV drug resistance across 
63 countries (appendix pp 1–13). 277 (93%) of 299 dataset 
with unambiguous location information were derived 
from urban settings (table 1). The identified studies 
included 23 948 genotypes from sub-Saharan Africa, 
(42·7% of all genotypes), 16 008 (28·6%) from 
Latin America and the Caribbean, and 16 088 (28·7%) 
from Asia. The median number of genotypes per study 
was 95 (table 1). There was a large amount of variation in 
the prevalence of drug-resistant mutations reported by 
studies, even within geographical regions (appendix p 14). 
We did not find study level summaries of sex or CD4 cell 
count to be associated with the prevalence of HIV drug 
resistance in any region (appendix pp 15–17). We detected 
an association between men who have sex with men and 
overall HIV drug resistance in Asia (p=0·047), but not for 
NNRTI or NRTI resistance specifically or in other 
geographical regions. We found insufficient data to 
assess other risk groups or the impact of rural versus 
urban or peri-urban setting on HIV drug resistance.
NNRTI resistance was more prevalent in more recent 
studies than in older studies across all regions (p<0·05 
for all regions; figure 1; appendix p 18). Annual increases 
in the odds of pretreatment NNRTI resistance per year 
were 23% (95% CI 16–29) in southern Africa, 17% (6–29) 
in western and central Africa, and 11% (2–20) in Asia. In 
eastern Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, 
there was evidence that the annual increase in the odds of 
pretreatment drug resistance, but not necessarily absolute 
changes in pretreatment drug resistance, have declined 
in more recent years (p for change in odds over time 
0·027 for eastern Africa and 0·033 for Latin America and 
the Caribbean). Estimated annual increases in the odds of 
pretreatment NNRTI resistance since 2007 were 
17% (5–30) in eastern Africa and 11% (5–18) in 
Latin America and the Caribbean. The model-predicted 
year-on-year increases in prevalence levels of NNRTI 
resistance between 2015 and 2016 were 1·8% in southern 
Africa, 1·3% in eastern Africa, 1·0% in western and 
central Africa, 0·9% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
and 0·3% in Asia. Modelled prevalence estimates of 
pretreatment NNRTI resistance in 2016 were 11·0% 
(7·5–15·9) in southern Africa, 10·1% (5·1–19·4) in 
eastern Africa, 7·2% (2·9–16·5) in western and central 
Africa, 9·4% (6·6–13·2) in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, and 3·2% (1·8–5·6) in Asia (figure 1). As 
expected, the prevalence of NNRTI resistance in studies 
done between 2014 and 2016 agreed well with model-
predicted prevalence levels for 2016 in all regions 
(appendix p 18).
By contrast with the increasing prevalence of NNRTI 
resistance over time, we saw little change in the 
prevalence of NRTI resistance, with model predicted 
prevalence in 2016 below 5% in all regions (figure 2). For 
Latin America and the Caribbean, western and central 
Africa, and Asia, there was no discernible trend in NRTI 
resistance over time (p>0·05 for all), and although 
increases in NRTI resistance were significant over time 
in southern Africa (p=0·015) and eastern Africa 
(p=0·017), changes in the prevalence of resistance were 
small (figure 2).
The most common NNRTI mutations (present in 10% 
or more of individuals with pretreatment drug resistance) 
from the WHO surveillance drug-resistance mutations 
list were Lys103Asn (present in 793 [34%] of 2349 people 
with pretreatment drug resistance), Tyr181Cys (215 [9%] 
patients), and Gly190Ala (200 [9%] patients; figure 3). 
The most common NRTI mutation was Met184Ile/Val 
(292 [12%] patients). Tenofovir resistance (Lys65Arg/Asn 
or Leu74Val/Ile) was relatively uncommon (3% of patients; 
patient-level data not available), although the thymidine 
analogue mutations Asp67Asn (134 [6%] patients) and 
Met41Leu (267 [11%] patients), which confer resistance to 
zidovudine, were more common. The prevalence of drug 
resistance to protease inhibitors was universally very low 
(<1%). The total number of drug-resistance mutations 
was available from 249 studies involving 29 898 patients 
in total and 1452 patients with any drug-resistant 
mutation. In these 1452 patients, the mean number of 
mutations per patient was 1·53 (SD not available from 
study-level data).
In a subset of 27 studies with 6534 patients, information 
was available on the presence of previous antiretroviral 
exposure. Previous antiretroviral exposure occurred in

538 (8%) patients and was associated with substantially 
higher NNRTI resistance. Despite scarce data for many 
geographical regions, we were able to detect significant 
differences in the prevalence of pretreatment NNRTI 
resistance between patients with and without previous 
antiretroviral drug exposure in Asia, Latin America and 
the Caribbean, and southern Africa (table 2). Differences 
were not significant in eastern Africa, or western and 
central Africa; although statistical power was limited, 
particularly for western and central Africa where few 
patients had prior exposure (table 2; appendix p 19). 
NRTI resistance was also more common among 
individuals with previous antiretroviral drug exposure 
compared with antiretroviral drug naive in all regions, 
with significant differences in all regions except for east 
Africa (table 2; appendix p 19).
We identified a subset of 13 studies with prospective 
data on treatment outcomes in adults in Africa who 
reported previous antiretroviral drug exposure. People 
who initiated NNRTI-based ART and self-reported 
previous antiretroviral drug exposure (n=83) had 
significantly greater risk of virological failure (defined as 
a viral load of 1000 copies per mL) at 12 months than 
antiretroviral-naive people (n=1944; odds ratio 2·91, 
95% CI 1·48–5·72 after adjustment for age, baseline viral 
load, baseline CD4 cell count, initial ART, adherence, 
WHO clinical stage, year of ART initiation, sex, and

Discussion
Pretreatment HIV drug resistance can be detected in 
people naive to antiretroviral drugs who are initiating 
ART or people who are initiating or re-initiating first-line 
ART who have had previous exposure. Pretreatment 
drug resistance can be either transmitted or acquired 
drug resistance, or both. This resistance could have been 
transmitted at the time of infection (ie, transmitted drug 
resistance), or it might be acquired after antiretroviral 
drug exposure: eg, in women exposed to antiretroviral 
drugs for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission 
of HIV, people who have received pre-exposure 
prophylaxis, people re-initiating first-line ART after a 
period of treatment interruption without documented 
virological failure, or off-prescription use of ART through 
sharing within families or friends or black market 
availability.
Our 
analysis 
shows 
that 
the 
prevalence 
of 
pretreatment drug resistance is rising in many LMICs. 
This situation contrasts with that in high-income 
regions where the prevalence of pretreatment drug

resistance has been in decline over the past decade and 
has stabilised at around 10%.19 WHO 2016 antiretroviral 
guidelines recommend the use of NNRTI as a 
component of first-line ART regimens,4 which is 
widely implemented in LMICs, irrespective of previous 
exposure to antiretroviral drugs. A single aminoacid 
mutation can confer resistance to efavirenz or 
nevirapine, and the presence of NNRTI resistance is 
particularly 
crucial 
to 
predict 
the 
efficacy 
of 
recommended first-line regimens.10 Our analysis 
shows that, in several regions, pretreatment NNRTI 
resistance in populations initiating ART has reached 
levels 
exceeding 
the 
recently 
established 
10% 
prevalence threshold above which countries should 
urgently consider responding. This response could be 
by either introducing a non-NNRTI-based first-line 
regimen or, in circumstances where use of a non-
NNRTI-containing first-line regimen is not feasible 
because of cost or other considerations, using pre-
treatment drug-resistance testing to guide first-line 
ART regimen selection, if laboratory infrastructure 
and costs allow.17
To our knowledge, our analysis provides the first robust 
evidence that people with disclosed previous antiretroviral 
drug exposure at the time of treatment initiation

(ie, women exposed to treatment for the prevention of 
mother-to-child transmission or defaulters re-initiating 
first-line ART after a period of treatment interruption) 
are substantially more likely to have viruses resistant to 
both NNRTIs and NRTIs compared with people who 
report being antiretroviral-drug naive, in whom we infer 
resistance as being due to transmitted drug resistance. 
Data from several LMICs suggest that this pre-exposed 
population represents around 10–30% of people initiating 
or re-initiating first-line NNRTI-containing ART, a 
proportion that is likely to increase substantially 
following the rapid expansion in HIV treatment 
coverage.1
The present study also provides the first estimates of 
the risk of virological failure in individuals with previous 
exposure to antiretroviral drugs who initiate or re-initiate 
first-line NNRTI-based regimens in LMICs. The risk of 
virological failure was almost three times higher in the 
previously exposed group than in the treatment-naive 
group, which is reminiscent of data showing that 
presence of NNRTI resistance mutations before first-line 
treatment is associated with two to three times higher 
prevalence of virological failure after 12 months of 
treatment.10,12 These results suggest that self-reported 
previous exposure might be usable in clinic to identify 
people at increased risk of treatment failure and 
resistance. These findings underpin WHO guidelines on 
pretreatment drug resistance, which recommend the 
identification of individuals starting ART who are at 
increased risk of pretreatment drug resistance due to 
previous antiretroviral exposure (or other risk), with 
prioritisation of treatment with non-NNRTI based ART 
in this subpopulation. An alternative approach would be 
to identify patients with previous exposure and improve 
monitoring for early virological failure, although the 
problems of feedback of viral load results to patients and 
clinicians are likely to be significant in sub-Saharan 
Africa.
Notably, NRTI resistance also increased significantly 
over time in eastern and southern Africa. The prevalence 
of NRTI resistance was substantially lower than that of 
NNRTI resistance. This finding is not surprising for 
several reasons. First, in patients with virological failure, 
NNRTI mutations are among the earliest to emerge20 
and therefore greater transmission of these resistant 
variants retaining almost wild-type replication fitness

could be expected.21 The NRTI mutation Met184Val/Ile 
also emerges early, but is not commonly transmitted 
because of its significant fitness cost to the virus. In our 
analysis, about 10% of patients with pretreatment drug 
resistance had Met184Val/Ile mutations. Although a 
sub-analysis showed a significant doubling of the 
prevalence of Met184Val/Ile in individuals with previous 
exposure to antiretroviral drugs, this could nevertheless 
suggest previous exposure even in patients who did not 
report it.
Thymidine 
analogue 
mutations 
were 
common, 
consistent with rapid accumulation of such mutations 
following the failure of first-line thymidine analogue-
containing ART.22,23 By contrast, despite the scale-up of 
tenofovir-based ART and reports of the emergence of 
resistance to tenofovir in patients with treatment failure 
on tenofovir across sub-Saharan Africa,8 resistance to 
tenofovir was infrequent in our analysis. This finding is 
somewhat reassuring given concerns about the use of 
tenofovir for both the treatment and prevention of HIV 
infection.24 Nonetheless, continued surveillance for 
Lys65Arg/Asn and associated mutations such as 
Ala62Val remains important as tenofovir use is relatively 
new in many LMICs.25
Our study reports the prevalence of pretreatment drug 
resistance among 56 000 people initiating ART over two 
decades, which we identified via a systematic review that 
included information from nine nationally representative 
unpublished 
pretreatment 
drug-resistance 
surveys 
(n=7138) and five additional unpublished studies 
(n=2757), making ours the largest such study to date. In 
addition to adding contemporary data to our previous 
report,9 this analysis includes 2·4 times more data from 
Latin America and the Caribbean and 2·9 times more 
data from Asia than in our previous work, allowing us to 
do statistically robust analyses in these regions, where it 
was previously unclear whether NNRTI resistance was 
increasing.
Our study has important limitations including the 
large amount of between-study heterogeneity and the 
inclusion of studies that are not nationally representative 
(appendix). 
The 
large 
degree 
of 
unexplained 
heterogeneity reduces the statistical power to detect 
region-specific trends over time. The inclusion of non-
nationally representative studies has the potential to 
yield estimates of resistance that are too high or low. 
However, we were reassured by noting that the results 
from nationally representative surveys included in our 
analysis showed estimates of the prevalence of 
pretreatment drug resistance that were broadly similar 
to those from studies using a convenience sample in the 
same countries. In addition to these limitations, there 
were few studies from rural settings, so the analysis 
reflects the prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance 
primarily in urban and peri-urban areas. However, as 
access to ART has substantially increased in sub-Saharan 
Africa, similar trends might well be expected in rural 
areas with similar ART programmes. The inclusion of 
results using different genotyping methods and 
interpretation systems is a potential drawback of this 
analysis. Finally, we did not account for mutations in the 
connection domain of reverse transcriptase, which is 
known to confer NRTI and NNRTI resistance with 
mutations 
such 
as 
Asn348Ile;26,27 
therefore, 
the 
prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance might have 
been underestimated.
With increasing global use of ART for both the 
treatment and prevention of HIV infection and 
increasing global trends in the prevalence of HIV drug 
resistance, efforts to improve HIV programme quality 
and prevent the emergence and transmission of drug-
resistant HIV should be strengthened. Although, HIV 
drug-resistance testing is not routinely available for 
individual patient management in many LMICs, the 
monitoring of patient and clinical factors associated with 
the emergence of preventable HIV drug resistance and 
successful population-level viral load suppression are 
relatively inexpensive, and can be used to identify gaps in 
service delivery and programme quality that can be 
corrected. These factors include retention on ART 12 
months after treatment initiation, on-time pill pick-up, 
drug stock outs, viral load suppression, viral load 
completion, and timely switching to second-line ART. 
Monitoring of these factors, or early warning indictors of 
HIV drug resistance, is recommended by WHO on an 
annual 
basis 
at 
all 
ART 
clinics 
through 
the 
implementation of the consolidated strategic information 
guidelines for HIV in the health sector.28–30
Our findings reinforce the need for routine, robust 
nationally representative surveillance of pretreatment 
drug resistance and the need for each country to assess 
the prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance in people 
starting ART, irrespective of reported previous exposure 
to antiretroviral drugs. WHO guidelines provide 
recommendations on the appropriate public health 
response in the face of rising prevalence of pretreatment 
NNRTI resistance. The data presented in this report will 
help to inform policy makers and donors on the urgent 
need to respond to pretreatment drug resistance in 
settings where a high prevalence of resistance has 
already been reached.
At present, point-of-care drug resistance testing is not 
available, although substantial efforts and resources 
have been directed to this field and candidate signature 
mutations for surveillance have been identified.31 Earlier 
treatment initiation combined with routine viral load 
monitoring in people on treatment should lead to more 
viral load suppression and less pretreatment drug 
resistance, providing that the people who are identified 
as having confirmed virological failure are promptly 
switched to active second-line and or third-line 
regimens. One important caveat, however, is the fact 
that individuals on first line treatment sometimes 
experience 
virological 
rebound

re-suppression even in the absence of viral load 
monitoring,32 reinforcing the continual need for 
adherence support. Particular attention should be paid 
to people initiating ART who have had previous 
exposure to antiretroviral drugs, given that our data 
show increased prevalence of not only NNRTI but also 
NRTI mutations in this group compared with 
antiretroviral drug-naive individuals as well as an 
independently higher risk of virological failure. Finally, 
routine surveillance of population-level HIV drug 
resistance coupled with strengthened approaches to 
prevent the development of resistance and sound 
evidence-based responses will be essential to the 
attainment of the global goal to eliminate AIDS as a 
public health threat by 2030.
