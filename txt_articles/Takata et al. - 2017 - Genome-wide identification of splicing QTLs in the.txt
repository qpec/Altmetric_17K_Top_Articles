Genome-wide identification of splicing QTLs
in the human brain and their enrichment
among schizophrenia-associated loci
Atsushi Takata1,2, Naomichi Matsumoto2 & Tadafumi Kato1
Detailed analyses of transcriptome have revealed complexity in regulation of alternative
splicing (AS). These AS events often undergo modulation by genetic variants. Here we
analyse RNA-sequencing data of prefrontal cortex from 206 individuals in combination with
their genotypes and identify cis-acting splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) throughout the
genome. These sQTLs are enriched among exonic and H3K4me3-marked regions. Moreover,
we observe significant enrichment of sQTLs among disease-associated loci identified by
GWAS, especially in schizophrenia risk loci. Closer examination of each schizophrenia-
associated loci revealed four regions (each encompasses NEK4, FXR1, SNAP91 or APOPT1),
where the index SNP in GWAS is in strong linkage disequilibrium with sQTL SNP(s), sug-
gesting dysregulation of AS as the underlying mechanism of the association signal. Our study
provides an informative resource of sQTL SNPs in the human brain, which can facilitate
understanding of the genetic architecture of complex brain disorders such as schizophrenia.

 A
lternative splicing (AS) is the process by which different
splice sites in precursor messenger RNA are selected to
generate multiple mRNA isoforms. AS events are often
regulated in a cell type-, condition- or species-specific manner.
Notably, recent studies have demonstrated that complexity of AS
regulation is highest in primates1, and that there is a distinct and
more complex pattern of AS in brain tissues2,3. Such highly
intricate regulation of AS in the human brain can play an
important role in normal function and development of the central
nervous system. For example, a number of genetic mutations that
affect global regulation of AS or alter AS of a specific gene are
known to be associated with various brain disorders4,5. More
recently, it was reported that a subset of de novo germline
mutations, whose important roles in the genetic aetiology of
neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders
(ASDs) and schizophrenia has been established6–10, probably
contribute to the risk of ASD and schizophrenia by affecting
AS11. In addition, dysregulation of AS is reported in multiple
postmortem brain studies of ASD12,13 and schizophrenia14,15.
As represented by canonical splice site variants disrupting
exon–intron boundaries, regulation of AS can be controlled by
genetic variants. Not only variants directly changing splice site
sequences, it has been demonstrated that genetic variants
controlling AS events, referred to as splicing quantitative trait
loci (sQTLs), spread throughout the genome. In particular, recent
large-scale studies utilizing the data of RNA sequencing (RNA-
seq) have successfully identified sQTLs in a genome-wide
manner3,16. However, these studies are primarily focusing on
non-neuronal tissues and thereby sQTLs in the human brain have
not yet been well characterized. Although a previous microarray-
based
study
has
identified
exon-specific
QTLs
in
brain
tissues, detectable AS events depend on array design and also
are restricted to exon skipping. Therefore, a study utilizing RNA-
seq data has a particular advantage in identifying more AS
events17.
To comprehensively detect sQTLs in the human brain, here we
analyse RNA-seq data of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
tissues from 4200 individuals in combination with their
microarray-based genotype data. After applying stringent filtering
criteria, we identify a total of B1,500 sQTL single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that are likely to be independent of each
other. By analysing characteristics of these brain sQTL SNPs, we
describe functional properties of these variants and their potential
roles in the genetic aetiology of human diseases, particularly in
brain disorders such as schizophrenia. We also show an example
how the information of sQTLs can be utilized to better
understand the complex genetic architecture of human diseases
and to specify promising candidates for culprit genes using the
data of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) for
schizophrenia18.
Results
Identification of cis-acting splicing QTLs in human brain. We
first analysed RNA-seq data of DLPFC samples (all from Brod-
mann area 9) from genetically homogenous 206 individuals
(Supplementary Fig. 1, extracted by using the result of multi-
dimensional scaling) without neuropsychiatric diseases or neu-
rological insults immediately prior to death (downloaded from
the CommonMind Consortium Knowledge Portal, summary
statistics are available in Supplementary Table 1, see also
Methods) to comprehensively identify AS events in the human
brain. For this purpose we used vast-tools13, a software package
designed to identify various types of AS events, including
alternative exon skipping (Alt EX), alternative usage of splice
sites (Alt SS) and intron retentions (IRs). After applying quality
control filters (see Methods for details), we identified a total of
102,469 AS events in autosomes, consisting of 29,271 Alt EX,
3,310 Alt SS (of which 1,265 were at the 50-donor site and 2,045
were at the 30-acceptor site) and 69,888 IRs. We next analysed this
list of AS in combination with quality-controlled SNP genotyping
data of the same individuals using Matrix eQTL19 to identify cis-
acting (within ±100 kb of the AS event) sQTLs in a genome-
wide manner (see Methods for details). To conservatively define
sQTL SNPs, we first applied a standard correction for multiple
testing implemented in Matrix eQTL (Benjamini–Hochberg
procedure) to the P-values for all SNP–AS pairs and then the
corrected
P-values
were
further
subjected
to
Bonferroni
correction with the number of AS events within the ±100 kb
window for each SNP. This is because a SNP with many AS
events in the surrounding region should have a higher chance to
show significant association (see Methods for details). After
performing these procedures, we identified a total of 8,966 sQTL
SNPs with the ‘double-corrected’ P-value o0.05. The full list of
sQTL SNPs along with information of the associated AS events is
available in Supplementary Data 1. Consistent with previous
studies of non-neuronal tissues3,16, when we plotted the double-
corrected P-value and the distance to the nearest AS event for
each SNP, we observed that variants at the proximity of AS are
enriched for sQTL SNPs (Fig. 1a).
The identified 8,966 sQTL SNPs are involved in 1,595 AS
events of 1,341 unique genes. When we performed a gene-set
enrichment analysis of these 1,341 genes using the Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery20, we found
highly
significant
enrichment
of
‘SP_PIR_KEYWORDS:
alternative splicing’ (Benjamini-corrected P ¼ 8.6 � 10 � 29) and
‘UP_SEQ_FEATURE:
splice
variants’
(Benjamini-corrected
P ¼ 1.1 � 1028),
which
denote
genes
with
known
splicing
isoforms (Supplementary Data 2). Therefore, on the one hand,
our result is compatible with the existing knowledge of genes
undergo AS and, on the other hand, the list of genes regulated by
sQTL SNPs identified here provides new candidates for genes
with splicing isoforms, because 440% of the input genes were
not included in ‘SP_PIR_KEYWORDS: alternative splicing’ or
‘UP_SEQ_FEATURE: splice variants’ (Supplementary Data 2)
but in fact have detectable alternatively spliced regions.
Functional characterization of sQTL SNPs. We consequently
attempted to functionally characterize sQTL SNPs. For this
purpose, we first extracted the best sQTL SNP for each AS event
(N ¼ 1,595) and then performed linkage disequilibrium (LD)-
based pruning (see Methods). After performing this procedure,
there was a set of 1,539 sQTL SNPs that are likely to be inde-
pendent of each other. Next, we performed LD-based pruning on
SNPs with an uncorrected P-value40.05 (N ¼ 170,241) with the
same parameters applied to sQTL SNPs, leaving 89,367 SNPs that
are unlikely to be associated with AS (we considered these as non-
sQTL SNPs). From this list of non-sQTL SNPs, we generated a set
of 48,068 SNPs with the distribution of minor allele frequency
(MAF) matched to the set of 1,539 sQTL SNPs and used them for
comparison (see Supplementary Fig. 2 and Methods).
By functionally classifying the SNPs according to the definition
in SnpEff21, we found that sQTL SNPs are significantly enriched
among variants in exonic regions (that is, nonsense, readthrough,
start-loss, frameshift, canonical splice site, missense, synonymous,
splice region, 50-untranslated region (UTR), 30-UTR and non-
coding exon variants; shown in warm colours in Fig. 1b) when
compared with non-sQTL SNPs (P ¼ 8.6 � 10 � 87, odds ratio
(OR) ¼ 3.84,

By

enrichment of sQTL SNPs among each functional type of
variants, as expected, we found significant enrichment with the

with

correction), followed by 50-UTR and synonymous variants
(Fig. 1c). In contrast, there was significant underrepresentation
of sQTL SNPs among intergenic variants.
By manually inspecting all individual sQTL SNPs at the
canonical splice sites (N ¼ 9, from the full list of 8,966 SNPs
before pruning), we found that 8 out of the 9 SNPs are associated
with AS of the adjacent exon. The remaining one sQTL
SNP (rs8873 at chr11: 58,378,424 in ZFP91) is at a splice
site that is found in the RefSeq Genes track but not in the
Ensembl Gene Predictions track of the UCSC Genome Browser
(https://genome.ucsc.edu/) (Supplementary Fig. 3) and transcripts
spliced at this position (chr11: 58,378,426) were not detected in
our analysis. Among the eight sQTL SNPs associated with AS of
the adjacent exon, three variants are contributing to known
(annotated by Ensembl Gene Predictions) AS events (Fig. 2). In
the case of rs2276611 at chr2: 170,441,001 in PPIG, alternative
splice sites are almost exclusively used depending on the alleles
(Fig. 2a). Around rs3803354 at chr15: 40,856,989 in C15orf57,
there are three different splice sites (Fig. 2b). Although the major
isoform is spliced at chr15: 40,857,175 (blue arrow head in
Fig. 2b), proportion of the isoform spliced at chr15: 40,856,990
(red arrow head) increases in C allele carriers in an additive

 manner and also there is a minor isoform (average percent-
spliced-in (PSI)o1) spliced at chr15: 40,856,965 (green arrow
head). In the case of rs80113248 at chr20: 18,142,462 in
CSRP2BP, both the two splice sites 3 bp distant to each other
(chr20: 18,142,464 and 18,142,467) are used in A allele carriers,
whereas in G/G carriers the transcripts are exclusively spliced at
chr20: 18,142,467 (Fig. 2c). For the other five canonical splice site
sQTL SNPs at the proximity of associated AS, we also found that
disruption of canonical splice site by the variant allele causes
increased proportion of exon skipping or IR (Supplementary
Fig. 4). Although the number of canonical splice site variants
analysed in this study is small, identification of these ‘positive
control’ variants regulating AS in an expected way could support
the validity of our analyses.
sQTL SNPs and genetic regulatory elements. In a recent study
of non-neuronal tissues, enrichment of sQTL SNPs among var-
ious regulatory elements was reported3. By using the data of the
ENCODE project22, we analysed whether the brain sQTL SNPs
identified in this study are enriched among variants within
genomic regions with the following regulatory annotations;
DNase I hypersensitive sites, monomethylated histone H3 lysine
4 (H3K4me1), trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3),
acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac), acetylated histone H3
lysine 27 (H3K27ac) and transcription factor (TF) binding sites.
We found significant enrichment of sQTL SNPs among variants
within H3K4me3 marks (P ¼ 1.7 � 10 � 11, OR ¼ 2.10, two-tailed
Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction) and significant
depletion of these SNPs among H3K4me1 (P ¼ 9.0 � 10 � 6,

Enrichment analysis of sQTLs among disease-associated loci.
To analyse the property of sQTL SNPs in the context of their
potential contribution to disease risks, we performed enrichment
analyses using the data of the GWAS Catalog23, a collection of
data from GWAS for various human diseases and traits (see
Methods for definition of the associated loci). When we tested
whether sQTL SNPs are globally enriched among loci associated
with various human diseases (defined by the Experimental Factor
Ontology (EFO)24 term ‘EFO_0000408: disease’), we found
significant enrichment when compared with non-sQTL SNPs
(P ¼ 1.7 � 10 � 8, OR ¼ 1.33, one-tailed Fisher’s exact test). We
next analysed enrichment of sQTL SNPs using the data of nine
individual diseases with the largest numbers of genome-wide
significantly associated SNPs in the Catalog (breast cancer,
colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis,
prostate cancer, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia and
type 2 diabetes), as well as four additional brain disorders
(autism, Alzheimer’s disease, bipolar disorder and Parkinson’s
disease) and two most intensively investigated non-disease traits
(height
and
body
mass
index).
We
observed
significant
enrichment of sQTL SNPs among the loci associated with
inflammatory bowel disease (P ¼ 0.0065, OR ¼ 1.41, one-tailed
Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction), schizophrenia
(P ¼ 0.0092, OR ¼ 2.53) and psoriasis (P ¼ 0.011, OR ¼ 2.57)
after performing correction for multiple testing (Fig. 4a). As we
found that in some cases (for example, in the case of psoriasis) the
enrichment was mostly driven by variants in the major
histocompatibility
complex
(MHC)
locus
when
checking
individual SNPs in the associated loci, we also performed
enrichment
analyses
excluding
the
data
of
SNPs
in
the
MHC locus. In these analyses, there was significant enrichment
of sQTL SNPs among the loci associated with schizophrenia
(P ¼ 9.9 � 10 � 5,
OR ¼ 3.72),
inflammatory
bowel
disease
(P ¼ 0.0014,
OR ¼ 1.43)
and
multiple
sclerosis
(P ¼ 0.036,
OR ¼ 3.71) (Fig. 4a).
In line with the fact that the data set used in this study derives
from brain tissues, diseases whose associated loci are enriched for
sQTL SNPs with the highest ORs include autism, schizophrenia
and multiple sclerosis, whereas enrichment among autism-
associated loci was not statistically significant (Fig. 4a, analyses
excluding MHC variants). Among these diseases, most statisti-
cally significant enrichment was observed for schizophrenia-
associated loci (P ¼ 9.9 � 10 � 5 after performing Bonferroni
correction). We next focused on this observation and performed
several confirmatory analyses to test the credibility of this result.
First, we repeated the analysis using the data of well-defined 108
schizophrenia-associated loci described in the largest GWAS to
date conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium18 (PGC
GWAS). This was because some of the SNPs identified by PGC
GWAS were not included in the GWAS Catalog and the
associated loci were defined in a more sophisticated way in
PGC GWAS. With this data set, we confirmed that there was
significant enrichment of sQTL SNPs among the risk loci (Fig. 4b,
P ¼ 1.1 � 10 � 7,
OR ¼ 4.01,
one-tailed
Fisher’s
exact
test).
Second, to test whether the enrichment is driven by higher
proportion of exonic variants among sQTL SNPs (these variants
would be more likely to be functional and thereby associated with
schizophrenia regardless of their impacts on AS), we performed
an analysis using the data of SNPs in non-exonic (that is, intronic
and intergenic) regions (N of SNPs ¼ 1,139). We found that non-
exonic
sQTL
SNPs
are
significantly
enriched
among
schizophrenia-associated loci when compared with non-sQTL
SNPs in non-exonic regions (Fig. 4c, P ¼ 0.0030, OR ¼ 2.66, one-
tailed Fisher’s exact test). On the other hand, there was no
statistically significant enrichment of exonic sQTL SNPs among
schizophrenia risk loci when compared with exonic non-sQTL
SNPs (Fig. 4c, P ¼ 0.36, OR ¼ 1.26), suggesting that non-exonic
sQTL SNPs are particularly contributing to schizophrenia risk by
their impacts on splicing regulation. Third, we performed an
analysis excluding sQTL SNPs associated with IR (N of excluded
SNPs ¼ 398). This was because often detection of IR is more
challenging than Alt EX and Alt SS, and the RNA-seq data set
used in this study derives from libraries prepared by ribosomal
RNA depletion (not poly-A selection; thus, premature RNA

Significant enrichment of sQTL SNPs among schizophrenia-
associated loci observed above indicates that some of these SNPs
could causally contribute to the risk of schizophrenia by affecting
AS. We next sought to identify plausible candidates for such
sQTL SNPs. For this purpose, we utilized the data of PGC
GWAS18 and selected candidate sQTL SNPs with the following
criteria: (1) in LD with an index schizophrenia-associated SNP
identified in the PGC GWAS at r240.8 (it is noteworthy that we
considered the most significantly associated SNP with available
information of LD in the 1000 Genomes March 2012 data set at
each locus as the index SNP, see Methods for more details), (2) by

wide significance (Po5 � 10 � 8) and (3) included in the list of
‘credible SNPs’ (the sets of SNPs 99% likely to contain the causal
variants; see Methods and ref. 18 for more details). We found that
four schizophrenia-associated loci harbour sQTL SNPs fulfilling
the selection criteria (Fig. 5). One was found on chromosome
3p21, where the index schizophrenia-associated SNP (rs2535627,
P
for
schizophrenia
association
in
the
PGC
GWAS ¼
4.0 � 10 � 11) itself was identified as an sQTL SNP significantly
associated with an Alt EX of NEK4 (double-corrected P for
sQTL ¼ 7.8 � 10 � 5) (Fig. 5a). On chromosome 3, there was
another locus (3q26) with an sQTL SNP that is in strong LD with
the index SNP. At this locus, rs1805564 associated with an Alt EX
of FXR1 (double-corrected P for sQTL ¼ 0.019) is in LD with the
index SNP rs34796896 (P for schizophrenia association ¼ 6.2 �
10 � 11) at r2 ¼ 0.94 (Fig. 5b). On chromosome 6q14, an sQTL
SNP rs217323 was associated with an IR of SNAP91 (double-
corrected P for sQTL ¼ 2.1 � 10 � 21) and this SNP is in LD with
the index SNP rs3798869 (P for schizophrenia association ¼
1.2 � 10 � 9) at r2 ¼ 0.97 (Fig. 5c). The last one was found on
chromosome 14q32, where an sQTL SNP rs7148456 associated
with an Alt EX of APOPT1 (also known as C14orf153, double-
corrected P for sQTL ¼ 3.2 � 10 � 10) is in LD with the index SNP
rs12887734 (P for schizophrenia association ¼ 2.3 � 10 � 12) at
r2 ¼ 0.86
(Fig.
5d).
Identification
of
these
SNPs
suggests
dysregulation of AS at these loci as plausible biological basis
explaining the association signals and points to the genes whose
AS is regulated by sQTL SNPs (that is, NEK4, FXR1, SNAP91 and
APOPT1) as promising candidates for causally associated genes
among multiple genes included in each risk locus.
Discussion
In this study, we analysed a large-scale data set of human brain
transcriptome in combination with the genotyping data and
identified variants controlling AS events, sQTL SNPs, in a
genome-wide manner. To our knowledge, this is the first study
comprehensively identifying sQTLs using RNA-seq data derived
from human brain samples.
By characterizing properties of the detected sQTL SNPs, we
found that these SNPs are enriched among exonic variants,
including coding SNPs (Fig. 1b,c). This observation is consistent
with a recently introduced notion that many of the coding
variants not only define the sequence of the encoded protein but
also have an impact on various regulatory functions25,26. We also
observed that sQTL SNPs are enriched among variants within
H3K4me3 marks (Fig. 3a). There is accumulating evidence that
this histone mark is not only associated with transcriptional
activation, but also plays a role in AS27,28. This process can be
mediated by physical binding of spliceosome to H3K4me3 via a
chromo-helicase protein CHD1 (ref. 27), whose binding sites
were enriched for sQTLs (Fig. 3b). It is also known that various
epigenetic marks including H3K4me3 can be locally influenced by
genetic variants29. Therefore, some of the SNPs in H3K4me3
would alter epigenetic status and thereby act as sQTL SNPs. This
possible scenario can be related to enrichment of sQTL SNPs
among 50-UTR variants, which showed the second highest OR in
our analysis of various functional types of SNPs (Fig. 1c). This is
because H3K4me3 marks are enriched in the 50end of gene bodies
often including 50-UTRs30, besides well-known enrichment at
promoter regions. It would be also of note that AS of histone-
modifying genes such as KDM1A and EHMT2 themselves are
known to play a role in global epigenetic regulation and neuronal
differentiation31. Thus, it would be worthwhile to take this AS-
chromatin feedback loop into account. In the analysis of binding
sites for individual TF, we found the most significant enrichment
of sQTL SNPs among variants within binding sites for POLR2A
(this protein encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II is
included in the list of TF in ENCODE) (Fig. 3b), which is known
to be involved in AS regulation32,33. Strong enrichment was also
observed for binding sites for various chromatin regulators such
as PHF8, SIN3A and CHD1 (Fig. 3b). As partly discussed above,
this observation is in concordance with their roles in regulation of
AS27,28,34,35. Gene-set enrichment analysis of genes regulated by
sQTL SNPs found enrichment of genes with known splicing
isoforms, whereas it does not mean that all tested genes are
involved in regulation by AS nor that all genes in the ‘splicing’
term could be determined by our analysis.
In the enrichment analysis of sQTL SNPs using the data of
GWAS, we observed significant overrepresentation of these
variants among loci associated with various human diseases,
indicating roles of SNPs regulating AS in genetic disease
aetiologies. This observation is in agreement with the growing
evidence that the majority of SNPs identified in GWAS contribute
to the disease risks through their impact on gene regulatory
functions36,37. Specifically, we found that sQTL SNPs identified in
this study using the data of human brains are strongly enriched
among schizophrenia-associated loci. Besides SNPs controlling
gene-level expression (eQTL) or DNA methylation (mQTL or
meQTL), whose contribution to the schizophrenia risk has been
demonstrated in recent studies38–40, our results indicate that
sQTL SNPs, which are in most cases not overlap with gene-level
eQTLs41,42, can explain an additional part of the genetic
architecture of schizophrenia.
By utilizing the list of sQTL SNPs, we could specify four
promising candidate disease susceptibility genes for schizophre-
nia (that is, NEK4, FXR1, SNAP91 and APOPT1), whose AS are
regulated by sQTL SNPs in strong LD with the index SNPs
identified in the PGC GWAS. NEK4 encodes a member of never-
in-mitosis A kinase that regulates cell cycle and response to
double-stranded DNA damage43. It is of note that this gene is
most highly expressed in the brain among multiple adult human
tissues44 and plays a key role in stabilization of neuronal cilia44,
whose contribution to various neural functions including nervous
system development and adult neurogenesis45, as well as possible
involvement in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia46,47, have
been reported. FXR1 encodes a homologue of fragile-X mental
retardation protein (FMRP) that is responsible for fragile X
syndrome and the encoded protein (fragile X mental retardation
syndrome-related protein 1) is known to interact with FMRP48,49.
Recent large-scale genetic studies have consistently indicated
involvement of FMRP targets in the genetic architectures of
schizophrenia9,50 and ASD10,51, indicating this gene as a
particularly good candidate disease-associated gene. SNAP91
encodes the clathrin-associated protein AP180. AP180 is enriched
in the presynaptic terminal of neurons52 and play an essential role
in synaptic neurotransmission53,54. AP180 KO mice show
excitatory/inhibitory imbalance53, which has been reported in
patients
and
animal
models
of
neuropsychiatric
disorders
including schizophrenia55. APOPT1 encodes a mitochondrial
protein that induces apoptotic cell death56. Causal contribution of
this gene in cavitating leukoencephalopathy57, a rare brain
disorder,
as
well
as
accumulating
evidence,
suggesting
involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in neuropsychiatric
disorders58,59,
imply

APOPT1
in
the
pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
Considering several limitations of this study, first, although the
sample size in this study is substantial (N ¼ 206), it would not be
sufficient to confidently identify all brain sQTL SNPs. Second, in
this study we could only analyse the data of adult brain tissues
from the single brain region (DLPFC). Analyses of sQTLs using
large-scale data sets with higher spatial and temporal resolutions

 will provide a further informative data resource, especially in the
context of identification of genes and variants associated with a
disease attributable to deficits in the specific brain region(s) and/
or at the particular time period(s). Third, in this study we only
show statistically significant association between SNP and AS,
and have not experimentally validated impact of sQTL SNPs on
AS, whereas often it is very difficult to determine whether an
sQTL SNP associated with AS directly regulates splicing or just
tags a functional variant, which is not investigated here (such as a
rare splice region variant).
In summary, we in this study comprehensively identified
SNPs regulating AS events in the human brain, described the
characteristics of these sQTL SNPs and demonstrated that the list
of brain sQTL SNPs can be used to identify plausible candidate
genes/variants causally associated with schizophreni and will also
be useful to generate animal models. Our results provide a new
insight into the genetic architecture of schizophrenia. By
integrating various data resources (for example, sQTLs, eQTLs,
mQTLs and more), we will obtain a more detailed picture of the
genomic landscape of complex brain disorders.
Methods
RNA-seq data of DLPFC. RNA-seq data (BAM files) of DLPFC from individuals
without neuropsychiatric diseases or neurological insults immediately before death
(N of individuals ¼ 285) were downloaded from ‘Raw’ directory of the Common-
Mind Consortium Knowledge Portal (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:-
syn4923029) using Synapse Python Client (http://python-docs.synapse.org/
index.html). The data set was generated as a part of the CommonMind Consortium
supported by funding from Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited, F. Hoff-
man-La Roche Ltd and NIH grants R01MH085542, R01MH093725,

AG02219, AG05138 and MH06692. Brain tissue for the study was obtained from
the following brain bank collections: the Mount Sinai NIH Brain and Tissue
Repository, the University of Pennsylvania Alzheimer’s Disease Core Center, the
University of Pittsburgh NeuroBioBank and Brain and Tissue Repositories, and the
NIMH Human Brain Collection Core. CMC Leadership: Pamela Sklar, Joseph
Buxbaum (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), Bernie Devlin, David Lewis
(University of Pittsburgh), Raquel Gur, Chang-Gyu Hahn (University of Penn-
sylvania), Keisuke Hirai, Hiroyoshi Toyoshiba (Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company
Limited), Enrico Domenici, Laurent Essioux (F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd), Lara
Mangravite, Mette Peters (Sage Bionetworks), Thomas Lehner and Barbara
Lipska (NIMH). Detailed procedures for tissue collection, sample preparation,
RNA-seq and data processing are available in the Consortium’s wiki page
(https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2759792/wiki/69613). Briefly, ribosomal
RNA was depleted from about 1 mg of total RNA using Ribozero Magnetic Gold kit
(Illumina, San Diego, CA). The sequencing library was prepared using the TruSeq
RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina). Sequencing was performed by using
HiSeq2500 (Illumina). As the sequencing libraries are prepared by using rRNA
depletion procedures, the RNA-seq data should contain the information from total
RNA including non-coding RNA and precursor mRNA. Downloaded BAM files
for mapped and unmapped reads from each individual were merged by using
SAMtools60. Merged BAM files were converted into the fastq format using
bam2fastq (https://gsl.hudsonalpha.org/information/software/bam2fastq).
SNP genotyping data. Quality-controlled genotyping data (SNPs with zero
alternate alleles, genotyping call rate o0.98 or Hardy–Weinberg P-value
o5 � 10 � 5 and individuals with genotyping call rate o0.90 were removed) were
downloaded from ‘QCd’ directory of the CommonMind Consortium Knowledge
Portal (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4551740). Genotyping was per-
formed by using Infinium HumanOmniExpressExome v1.1 DNA Analysis Kit
(Illumina). With these genotype data, we performed multidimensional scaling
using PLINK61. As expected, the first dimension (the x axis of Supplementary
Fig. 1) represents ethnicities of the participants. We extracted the data of
Caucasians included in the single largest cluster indicated by the red box in
Supplementary Fig. 1 (N of individuals ¼ 206, summary statistics for these
individuals are available in Supplementary Table 1). After excluding SNPs with
MAFo1% among these 206 individuals with a homogeneous genetic background,
there were 607,993 autosomal SNPs. Of these SNPs, we extracted 313,906 SNPs
that are within ±100 kb of any of the identified AS events and used them in the
analysis of sQTL SNPs.
Comprehensive detection of AS events. Comprehensive detection of AS events
was performed by using vast-tools (version 0.2.1)13. We first mapped the reads in
the fastq files generated above onto the reference human genome (hg19) using the
‘align’ module of vast-tools with default parameters. Next, the results were merged
into a single file containing PSI of each AS event in each individual using the
‘combine’ module of vast-tools. By using the quality scores in the combined file
(Column 8), we first excluded AS events whose Score 1 (read coverage based on
actual reads) and Score 2 (read coverage based on corrected reads) in Column 8 did
not meet the minimum threshold (mapped reads Z10, in principle) in420% of
the individuals. We next excluded AS events whose PSI was 0 or 100% in 490% of
the individuals. After performing these procedures, there were a total of 102,469 AS
events. According to the predefined types of AS in vast-tools13, these were classified
into Alt EX, Alt SS and IRs.
Identification of sQTL SNPs. Correlation between genotypes and PSI of AS was
analysed by using Matrix eQTL19 with the additive linear model. To control
potential confounding factors, the following parameters were included in the
analysis as covariates; gender, age of death, research institute where the samples
were collected (Mount Sinai, Pennsylvania or Pittsburg), post-mortem interval,
brain pH, RNA integrity number and sequencing library batch. We considered all
AS-SNP pairs when the distance between AS and SNP is less than 100 kb. This
±100 kb window was determined by referring previous studies reporting that
sQTL SNPs are particularly enriched among the proximal regions16,41,62. When
there are multiple AS events within the ±100 kb window around a SNP, we used
the smallest P-value to define sQTL SNPs. The smallest P-value for each SNP was
then subjected to Bonferroni correction with the number of AS within the
±100 kb counted by window function of BEDtools63. This was because a SNP with
a large number of AS in the window should have higher chance to show significant
association.
Gene-set enrichment analysis of genes regulated by sQTL SNPs. A gene-set
enrichment analysis of genes with AS regulated by sQTL SNPs was performed by
using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery20 with
default parameters. In total, there were 1,341 unique genes with AS regulated by
sQTL SNPs. The input genes can be found in Supplementary Data 1.
sQTL and non-sQTL data sets for comparison. To generate a set of sQTL SNPs
probably contributing to AS regulation independently of each other, we first
extracted the best sQTL SNP for each AS event (N of SNPs ¼ 1,595). We next
performed LD-based pruning of these 1,595 SNPs using –indep-pairwise function
of PLINK61 with the following parameters: window size in SNPs ¼ 50, the number
of SNPs to shift the window at each step ¼ 5 and the r2 threshold ¼ 0.5. For this
analysis, the 1000 Genomes Project64 March 2012 EUR (Europeans) data set
downloaded as a part of the LocusZoom65 package was used as the reference. After
performing LD-based pruning, there were a total of 1,539 sQTL SNPs. To generate
a control data set of non-sQTL SNPs, we first extracted SNPs for which the smallest
uncorrected P-value was larger than 0.05 (N of SNPs ¼ 170,241). We then
performed LD-based pruning with the same parameters and the reference 1000
Genomes data set used for sQTL SNPs and generated a set of 89,367 SNPs, which
are unlikely to be associated with AS and not strongly dependent of each other
(non-sQTL SNPs). We then stratified these non-sQTL SNPs into 2% MAF bins and
extracted 48,068 SNPs with the distribution of MAF matched to the set of 1,539
sQTL SNPs (Supplementary Fig. 2). We used these sets of 1,539 sQTL SNPs and
48,068 non-sQTL SNPs in the downstream analyses to characterize the properties
of sQTL SNPs.
Functional annotation of sQTL and non-sQTL SNPs. We functionally annotated
1,539 sQTL and 48,068 non-sQTL SNPs by using SnpEff21. Information of SnpEff
annotation was collected by using MyVariant.info (http://myvariant.info/) and
Variant Effect Predictor (VeP)66. According to these annotations, SNPs were
classified into the following categories: nonsense, readthrough, start-loss,
frameshift, canonical splice site, missense, synonymous, splice region, 50-UTR,
30-UTR, non-coding exon, intron and intergenic variants. Splice region variants
were defined as variants either within 1–3 bases of the exon or 3–8 bases of the
intron from the splice site21. When a SNP was annotated with multiple functional
types, we assigned the SNP to the functional class probably having the highest
impact (that is, the leftmost one among the functional categories described above).
We considered nonsense, readthrough, start-loss, frameshift, canonical splice site,
missense, synonymous, splice region, 50-UTR, 30-UTR and non-coding exon
variants as exonic SNPs, and intron and intergenic variants as non-exonic SNPs.
Enrichment analyses of sQTL SNPs according to their functionalities were
performed by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test with the following 2 � 2 table: columns;
sQTL SNPs and non-sQTL SNPs, rows; SNPs ‘assigned’ and ‘not assigned’ to the
particular functional class. For enrichment analysis of each functional class of
variants, we performed Bonferroni correction according to the number of
functional types subjected to the analysis (ten types: canonical splice site, the other
loss-of-function, missense, synonymous, splice region, 50-UTR, 30-UTR, non-
coding exon, intron and intergenic variants).

 lysine 9, H3K27ac and TF-binding sites were downloaded from the ENCODE
portal (https://www.encodeproject.org/data/annotations/, accessed January 2016,
the data from Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium67 were also integrated to these
data sets). We analysed whether a SNP is included in each regulatory element using
BEDtools63. Enrichment analyses of sQTL SNPs among regulatory elements were
performed by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test with the following 2 � 2 table: columns;
sQTL SNPs and non-sQTL SNPs, rows; SNPs within and not within the regulatory
element. In the enrichment analyses of binding sites for individual TF, we excluded
TF for which the number of records (each record is B150 bp genomic region) in
the annotation file was smaller than 50,000. There were a total of 65 TF with 50,000
or more records of binding sites in the bed file downloaded from the ENCODE
portal. According to this number we applied Bonferroni correction.
Enrichment analyses of sQTLs among disease-associated loci. The list of SNPs
associated with various human traits was downloaded from the GWAS Catalog23
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas, the gwas_catalog_v1.0.1 file, accessed June 2016). We
included SNPs with genome-wide significant association (Po5 � 10 � 8) in our
analyses. An associated genomic locus for each SNP was defined as the genomic
region containing SNPs in LD with the index SNP at r240.6. SNPs in LD with the
index SNP were identified by using PLINK61 with the 1000 Genomes Project
March 2012 EUR data set. Next, we analysed whether each SNP falls within the
disease-associated loci using the BEDtools63. SNPs associated with human diseases
were extracted by using the EFO24 ID tags (MAPPED_TRAIT_URI column of the
GWAS catalog file). We considered SNPs associated with any of the child terms of
‘EFO_0000408: disease’ as disease-associated SNPs. Information of child terms of
‘EFO_0000408: disease’ was collected by using the ontoCAT package68 of R.
We evaluate whether there is enrichment of sQTL SNPs among associated loci by
one-tailed Fisher’s exact test with the following 2 � 2 table: columns; sQTL SNPs
and non-sQTL SNPs, rows; SNPs within and not within the disease-associated loci.
We performed these analyses for the following diseases/traits: (1) all human
diseases (EFO_0000408: disease); (2) nine individual diseases with the largest
numbers of genome-wide significantly associated SNPs in the GWAS Catalog23
(N of SNPsZ80): breast cancer, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease
(including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), multiple sclerosis, prostate
cancer, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes; (3) four
additional brain disorders: autism, Alzheimer’s disease, bipolar disorder and
Parkinson’s disease; and (4) two most intensively investigated non-disease traits:
height and body mass index. For analyses excluding SNPs in the MHC locus, we
did not use the information of SNPs in chr6:28,477,797–33,448,354 (hg19; based on
the definition by The Genome Reference Consortium http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/region.cgi?name=MHC&asm=GRCh37).
Confirmatory analyses for sQTLs in schizophrenia risk loci. A confirmatory
enrichment analysis using the data of 108 loci defined in PGC GWAS18 was
performed using the data downloaded from the PGC portal (https://
www.med.unc.edu/pgc/files/resultfiles/scz2.regions.zip). Enrichment analyses
excluding exonic variants were performed by extracting the data of intronic and
intergenic variants according to the SnpEff21 annotations described above (see
‘Functional Annotation of sQTLs and Non-sQTL SNPs’ section). An analysis
excluding sQTL SNPs associated with IR was performed by excluding 398 sQTL
SNPs whose most significantly associated AS was IR. Enrichment analyses of sQTL
SNPs among schizophrenia-associated loci using the data of PGC GWAS,
excluding the data of exonic variants or sQTL SNPs associated with IR were
performed by one-tailed Fisher’s exact test.
Identification of sQTL SNPs in strong LD with the index SNP. The full result of
the PGC schizophrenia GWAS18 (https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/files/resultfiles/
scz2.snp.results.txt.gz) and the data of credible causal sets of SNPs (sets of SNPs
that were 99% likely to contain the causal variants18; these sets were defined
for each schizophrenia-associated locus https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/files/
resultfiles/pgc.scz2.credible.SNPs.zip) were downloaded from the PGC portal
(http://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/downloads). By using these data sets, we extracted
sQTL SNPs that are: (1) in LD with an index schizophrenia-associated SNP
identified in the PGC GWAS at r240.8, (2) by themselves associated with
schizophrenia at the level of genome-wide significance (Po5 � 10 � 8) and (3)
included in the list of ‘credible SNPs’ described above. In total, we found sQTL
SNPs satisfying these criteria in four independent loci. In two instances,
information of LD in the 1000 Genomes March 2012 EUR data set was not
available for the index SNPs described in Supplementary Table 2 of ref. 18
(chr3_180594593_I and chr6_84280274_D). In these cases, we considered the most
significantly associated SNP with available information of LD in each locus as the
index SNP (rs34796896 for chr3_180594593_I and rs3798869 for
chr6_84280274_D). Regional visualization of the PGC GWAS result (the
scz2.snp.results.txt.gz file) with information of sQTL SNPs and associated AS was
performed by using LocusZoom65 based on the 1000 Genomes March 2012 EUR
data set. SNPs not included in this reference data set were not displayed in the
figure. LD (r2) between the index SNP and sQTL SNP was computed by using
PLINK61 with the same 1000 Genomes March 2012 EUR data set.
