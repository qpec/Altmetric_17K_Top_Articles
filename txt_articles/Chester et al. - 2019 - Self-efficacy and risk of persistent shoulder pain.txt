Abstract 
1 
 
2 
Objectives: To (i) identify predictors of outcome for the physiotherapy management of shoulder pain 
3 
and (ii) enable clinicians to subgroup people into risk groups for persistent shoulder pain and 
4 
disability. 
5 
 
6 
Methods: 1030 people aged ≥18 years, referred to physiotherapy for the management of 
7 
musculoskeletal shoulder pain were recruited. 810 provided data at 6 months for 4 outcomes: 
8 
Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) (total score, pain sub-scale, disability sub-scale) and 
9 
Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH). 34 potential prognostic factors were 
10 
used in this analysis.  
11 
 
12 
Results: Four classification trees (prognostic pathways or decision trees) were created, one for each 
13 
outcome. The most important predictor was baseline pain and/or disability: higher or lower baseline 
14 
levels were associated with higher or lower levels at follow up for all outcomes. One additional 
15 
baseline factor split participants into four subgroups. For the SPADI trees, high pain self-efficacy 
16 
reduced the likelihood of continued pain and disability. Notably, participants with low baseline pain 
17 
but concomitant low pain self-efficacy had similar outcomes to patients with high baseline pain and 
18 
high pain self-efficacy. Cut points for defining high and low pain self-efficacy differed according to 
19 
baseline pain and disability. In the QuickDASH tree, the association between moderate baseline pain 
20 
and disability with outcome was influenced by patient expectation: participants who expected to 
21 
recover because of physiotherapy did better than those who expected no benefit. 
22 
 
23 
Conclusions: Patient expectation and pain self-efficacy are associated with clinical outcome. These 
24 
clinical elements should be included at the first assessment and a low pain self-efficacy response 
25 
considered as a target for treatment intervention.

What are the new findings? 
 
High levels of pain and disability at baseline are associated with high levels of pain and disability at 
6 month follow up. However, this ‘predicted’ poor outcome is modified to a predicted better 
outcome if the patient has high pain self-efficacy and a greater expectation of treatment. 
 
(Pain self-efficacy is the extent or strength of the patient’s belief in their ability to complete tasks 
and reach a desired outcome despite their shoulder pain). 
 
Low levels of baseline pain and disability are associated with low levels of follow up pain and 
disability. This predicted better outcome is modified to a predicted poor outcome if the patient has 
low pain self-efficacy. 
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future? 
 
We recommend that pain self-efficacy and patient expectation of outcome as a result of 
physiotherapy treatment should be formally assessed and discussed at the first physiotherapy 
appointment.

Introduction  
2 
 
3 
Persistent musculoskeletal shoulder pain is common and frequently associated with substantial 
4 
disability. Over a period of one month, between 16% and 31% of the general population in the United 
5 
Kingdom (UK) will have suffered from musculoskeletal shoulder pain lasting at least 24 hours.1-3 
6 
Experiencing shoulder pain concerns many and accounts for up to three percent of visits to General 
7 
Practitioners (GP) annually.4,5 and up to 48% of people with shoulder pain visit their GP more than 
8 
once over a three year period due to ongoing symptoms.5,6 The most effective treatment is not yet 
9 
known; clinical trials comparing surgical and non-surgical management, including exercises 
10 
prescribed by physiotherapists report equivocal effects.7-9 Between 8% and 11% of patients visiting 
11 
their GP with shoulder pain are referred to see a physiotherapist at initial consultation,5,10.11 rising to 
12 
18% over a three year period.5 
13 
 
14 
Response to physiotherapy is variable.  In a multicentre cohort study of 1030 patients with 
15 
musculoskeletal shoulder pain attending physiotherapy, of mean duration 14 months (standard 
16 
deviation 28 months), 69% of patients reported complete recovery or being much improved by 6 
17 
months follow-up; 17% reported only slight improvement and 14% reported no change or a 
18 
worsening of symptoms.12 A multivariable general linear model (GLM) was used to identify 
19 
prognostic factors associated with patient rated pain and disability.13 Several factors were consistently 
20 
associated with a better outcome at 6 months. One limitation of the GLM approach is the difficulty of 
21 
practical use, particularly in a clinical setting. All predictor variables within the model are used 
22 
simultaneously requiring lengthy calculations (particularly when there are many predictor variables).   
23 
 
24 
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) Analysis is an alternative method of providing prognostic 
25 
guidance. CART analysis considers the predictive value of prognostic factors sequentially, i.e. in a 
26 
hierarchy of importance. CART typically results in a simple and readily interpretable decision ‘tree’ 
27 
(or “what if” flow diagram). This can be graphically represented easily and requires no numeric 
28 
calculations.14 This can help guide clinicians to prioritise their initial prognostic assessment to those 
29 
factors which are most influential. When modifiable, prognostic factors may become targets for 
30 
interventions and inform shared decision making between clinicians and patients. The objective of 
31 
these analyses was to provide clinicians with a guide to the most influential factors that predict 
32 
outcome for people undergoing management for non-surgical musculoskeletal shoulder pain. 
33 
 
34 
 
35 
Methods 
36 
 
37 
 5 
 
Data were available on 1030 people with shoulder pain recruited from primary and secondary care to 
1 
a multicentre longitudinal cohort study in the East of England, UK, between November 2011 and 
2 
October 2013. People aged 18 years or over were eligible to participate if they were referred to 
3 
physiotherapy for the management of musculoskeletal shoulder pain and complained of shoulder or 
4 
arm pain reproduced on movement of the shoulder. Those presenting with shoulder fractures, 
5 
traumatic shoulder dislocations,  systemic source of shoulder symptoms, cervical radiculopathy or had 
6 
undergone shoulder surgery were excluded. Referral and treatment pathways were unaffected by 
7 
participation in the study. The study protocol has been published.15  
8 
 
9 
Outcome variables 
10 
Two validated patient rated outcome measures were collected at baseline and via postal questionnaire 
11 
at six month follow up: the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI),16,17 and Quick Disability of 
12 
the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (Quick-DASH).18 The SPADI is a joint specific questionnaire designed 
13 
to measure two domains: shoulder pain and disability. Thirteen items, five comprising a pain subscale 
14 
and eight a disability subscale, are scored from zero to ten where zero represents no pain or disability 
15 
and ten represents the worst pain imaginable or so difficult it requires help. For this analysis, each 
16 
domain carried equal weighting in the overall score. The QuickDASH is an upper limb region specific 
17 
questionnaire that includes items related to symptoms, daily activities, sleep, social and work 
18 
function. Eleven items are scored from one to five where one represents no difficulty and five 
19 
represents unable. Each item carries equal weighting in the final score. Scores are converted to a scale 
20 
of zero to 100, where zero represents no pain or disability and 100 represents maximum pain and 
21 
disability. 
22 
 
23 
Baseline predictor variables: 
24 
Data for potential prognostic factors were collected prior to and during the participant’s first 
25 
physiotherapy appointment using bespoke questionnaires and clinical record forms. These variables 
26 
included demographics, patient expectations and beliefs, lifestyle, general health, work, shoulder 
27 
history and presentation, and clinical examination findings.15 All factors statistically associated with 
28 
outcome (p≤0.05) in at least one of the multivariable linear models from our previous analysis13 were 
29 
included in the CART analysis. In addition, baseline factors measured, but not found to be statistically 
30 
significant, were entered if reported as a significant prognostic factor for outcome in reviews of other 
31 
musculoskeletal studies.19,20 A description of the variables included in the CART analysis are detailed 
32 
in Supplementary file 1. 
33 
 
34 
Patient involvement 
35 
Patient and public representatives were involved in the design of the study, in particular, details 
36 
associated with the timing and procedures for recruiting and follow up of participants, and the design 
37 
 6 
 
and layout of questionnaires for data collection. A lay version of results, designed with patient and 
1 
public representatives, were disseminated to all study participants who at their final data collection 
2 
replied that they would like a copy. Patients were not involved in the actual recruitment or conduct of 
3 
the study. 
4 
 
5 
Statistical analysis 
6 
We used regression trees algorithms, a sub-class of Classification And Regression Tree (CART),21 for 
7 
continuous outcome variables, in our analyses. CART uses a recursive partitioning of the study 
8 
sample to produce sub-groups as homogenous as possible with respect to the outcome of interest. This 
9 
partitioning is based upon a binary split of each predictor variable. It is a more flexible approach for 
10 
uncovering complex variable relationships than traditional linear modelling as it does not rely on any 
11 
functional relationship between the outcome and predictor variables, nor does it require any 
12 
distributional assumption regarding the outcome variable. CART is also less sensitive to outlying 
13 
data, well suited for a large number of predictor variables and therefore offers a suitable alternative 
14 
for building prediction models where the relationships among variables are unspecified and existing 
15 
parametric statistical methods are not suitable to guide the model building.22 The prediction accuracy 
16 
of CART is comparable with parametric regression models and it can be more accurate when the 
17 
relationship between the outcome and predictor variables is non-linear.21 Furthermore, the partitioning 
18 
in CART can be represented graphically as an easily interpretable decision tree14 that may then be 
19 
used to inform clinical practice. 
20 
 
21 
We constructed four regression trees for each of the four outcome variables, i.e. SPADI overall score, 
22 
SPADI pain subscore, SPADI disability subscore and QuckDASH score respectively.  We used the R 
23 
(R Core Team, 2015) package rpart.23 For each of the 6-month outcome variables the respective 
24 
baseline score was included within the list of predictor variables. Including the respective baseline 
25 
scores, the number of predictor variables entered in different models ranged between 32 and 34. The 
26 
pain and disability sub-scales were not included in the total SPADI tree analysis therefore using only 
27 
32 variables (see Supplementary file 1 for a complete list and definitions of variables). 
28 
 
29 
The procedure for building a regression tree in rpart is performed as follows:24 
30 
Building a tree: First, the predictor variable is found which best splits the sample into two sub-groups.  
31 
The ‘best’ is defined as the split that maximises the between groups sum-of-squares (or, equivalently, 
32 
minimises the within-group error sum-of-squares).  This process is applied separately to each sub-
33 
group recursively until the subgroups either reach a minimum size (set to 7 in our analysis, the default 
34 
in rpart) or until no improvement can be made in the model fit. 
35 
Pruning the tree: The resultant model is typically too complex and likely to over-fit the data. The 
36 
second stage of the procedure consists of using cross-validation to trim back the full tree. We used 10-
37 
 7 
 
fold cross-validation to evaluate model fit at a series of model complexities and chose the optimal 
1 
(pruned) tree by inspecting the plot of the cross-validated error against model complexity. Statistical 
2 
analyses were completed by a statistician without prior knowledge of the clinical area or results of 
3 
earlier analyses. Based on the cross validated predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) 
4 
statistic, these trees provided the best predicting models.  Retention of more baseline variables within 
5 
the trees did not improve their predictive capacity. See supplementary file 2 for the plot for cross-
6 
validated errors versus model complexity for SPADI (total score) at 6 months. 
7 
 
8 
Estimating a model and evaluating prediction accuracy on the same dataset generally over-estimates 
9 
model performance. It is, therefore, recommended to evaluate the model performance on an 
10 
independent dataset (i.e. a dataset that was not used to estimate the model). In the absence of an 
11 
independent test dataset for model evaluation, cross-validation approach is an alternative way to 
12 
create independent datasets for model assessment by holding apart a small portion of the sample for 
13 
model evaluation. More specifically, 10-fold cross-validation involves randomly splitting the data into 
14 
10 parts of similar size, holding aside one part (1/10th of the whole sample) for testing and using the 
15 
rest (9/10th) for model estimation. The process is repeated 10 times, meaning that each of the 10 folds 
16 
is used as independent test set for model evaluation. Overall model performance is typically assessed 
17 
by calculating prediction errors on each of the 10 folds and averaging across all of these results.  
18 
 
19 
Cross-validation is a widely used and acceptable way of validating model accuracy/performance and 
20 
we used this approach to select the optimal CART model, i.e., to select the variables that are most 
21 
predictive of the respective outcome variables (and also to remove those not contribution enough to 
22 
the prediction model). The results of this validation process ensures that our selected CART models 
23 
are optimal, despite not having a separate independent validation dataset. 
24

Results 
26 
 
27 
One thousand and fifty-five participants were assessed by physiotherapists and subsequently recruited 
28 
and consented into the study. One thousand and thirty participants were found to be eligible for the 
29 
study and provided adequate baseline data. There were no potential prognostic factors at baseline for 
30 
which more than 2% of data were missing. Eight hundred and eleven participants (79%) provided 
31 
outcome data at 6 month follow up. One participant was excluded due to incomplete outcome data.

All participants providing complete outcome data at six months were included in the CART analysis 
1 
for the SPADI and QuickDASH (n=810). There were differences between those participants who 
2 
provided complete data at six months and those who did not. Completers were older by a mean of 10 
3 
years, had greater pain self-efficacy by a mean of almost 4 out of a possible 60 points, were almost 
4 
twice as likely to exercise, and had a two-fold lower likelihood to report anxiety or depression. A 
5 
summary description of baseline characteristics for all participants’ (n=1030) for each of the 34 
6 
variables entered into the CART analysis are provided in supplementary file 3. 
7 
 
8 
Figures 2-5 represent the resulting pruned regression trees for the total SPADI, SPADI pain subscale, 
9 
SPADI disability sub scale, and QuickDASH at six months follow up. Three variables were identified 
10 
as important predictors of six-month outcomes: 1) baseline pain or disability levels, 2) pain self-
11 
efficacy and 3) patient expectation of “change as a result of physiotherapy treatment”. All three 
12 
variables were collected prior to the participant’s first physiotherapy attendance. Pain self-efficacy is 
13 
the extent or strength of the patient’s belief in their ability to complete tasks and reach a desired 
14 
outcome despite their shoulder pain.25 Pain self-efficacy was measured using the pain self-efficacy 
15 
questionnaire (PSEQ)26 which comprises of 10 items rated 0 to 6, zero representing minimum pain 
16 
self-efficacy and 6 representing maximum pain-self efficacy. The total score is out of 60, a higher 
17 
score representing higher pain self-efficacy. Patient expectation of change was collected in response 
18 
to the following question “How much do you expect your shoulder problem to change as a result of 
19 
physiotherapy treatment” and was measured on a 7 point Likert scale ranging from “completely 
20 
recover” to “worse than ever”.15 
21 
 
22 
The first ‘node’ (at the top of the trees) represents the sample (i.e. all 810 participants). This then 
23 
divides into two, based on cut-off values for baseline pain or disability (SPADI, SPADI subscale 
24 
score or QuickDASH). The baseline score was therefore considered the most important variable in 
25 
predicting the respective six-month outcome. In addition to baseline pain or disability, each pruned 
26 
regression tree retained only one other variable of the 34 variables considered: baseline pain self-
27 
efficacy or patient expectation.  Either pain self-efficacy or patient expectation led to classification of 
28 
participants into four subgroups. The number of participants in these subgroups ranged from 48 to 
29 
487.

The cut point for baseline SPADI scores (total, pain and disability sub-scores) at the first node of each

21 
pain sub scores into two groups using baseline pain self-efficacy scores, the cut off for the PSEQ was 
22 
40 and 41 respectively. When sub-dividing patients with higher baseline SPADI pain or disability 
23 
scores into two groups using pain self-efficacy scores, the cut off point for the PSEQ was consistently 
24 
48.

Table 1 and figures 2-4 show that the size of any subgroup with low pain self-efficacy ranged from 
1 
16% (n=127) to 20% (n=161) of participants in the cohort. The SPADI pain tree includes two 
2 
subgroups with low pain self-efficacy and this constitutes as 36% (n=288) of the cohort. The 
3 
discrimination between median outcome scores associated with different pain self-efficacy scores 
4 
differs between trees and baseline pain and/or disability. For example, the median difference in 
5 
subgroups is most marked for participants with high baseline SPADI pain subscores (≥75) and least 
6 
for participants with lower baseline total SPADI scores (<68). Twenty three percent (n=239) of the 
7 
cohort had a baseline of 41-59 on the QuickDASH, their outcomes were differentiated by their 
8 
expectation of “change as a result of physiotherapy treatment”: the median difference between 
9 
subgroups at outcome being 23/100 on the QuickDASH.

Validation

3 
External validation of the results was not possible as we were unable to identify an external dataset 
4 
containing the same or similar variables. We have, however, conducted an informal internal validation 
5 
of the results by partitioning the QuickDASH outcome data based on the classifications of the SPADI 
6 
regression trees and comparing the distribution of QuickDASH outcome within each sub-group with 
7 
that of the SPADI outcomes. Comparison of QuickDASH distributions corresponding to the total 
8 
SPADI, SPADI pain and SPADI disability trees are displayed in Supplementary files 4, 5 and 6 
9 
respectively. The similarity of the pattern distributions of the SPADI outcome on the left and 
10 
QuickDASH outcome on the right demonstrate the replicability of the SPADI tree.

Discussion  
14 
The objective of these analyses was to identify important predictors of outcome for patients 
15 
presenting with non-surgically managed musculoskeletal shoulder pain. We identified that only three 
16 
of 34 baseline variables considered in the classification trees were predictive of outcome. These were 
17 
i) baseline pain or disability measured by the SPADI or QuickDASH, ii) pain self-efficacy measured 
18 
by the PSEQ,26 and iii) patient’s expectation of “change as a result of physiotherapy treatment”, 
19 
measured on a 7-point Likert scale.15 As expected, there was a positive association between pain and 
20 
disability at baseline and at six month follow up, i.e. those with higher scores at baseline tended to 
21 
have higher scores at follow-up. However, in all three SPADI classification trees higher pain self-
22 
efficacy influenced this relationship: for patients with high baseline pain or disability (cut off points 
23 
75 and 62 respectively), higher pain self-efficacy (PSEQ≥48) reduced the likelihood of continued 
24 
high levels of pain and disability at six-month follow up. Between 16 and 19% of participants were at 
25 
risk of continued high levels of pain and disability (measured by SPADI pain and disability subscores) 
26 
at 6 months due to i) high baseline pain and disability and ii) low pain self-efficacy. For patients with 
27 
moderate levels of baseline pain and disability measured with the QuickDASH (41 to 59), the 
28 
association was influenced by patient expectation: participants who expected to completely recover or 
29 
much improve as a result of physiotherapy did better than patients who expected to only slightly 
30 
improve, stay the same or worsen. Participants at risk of continued high levels of pain and disability at 
31 
six-month follow up due to a lower expectation of recovery constituted 7% of our cohort at six month 
32 
follow up. 
33 
 
34 
 12 
 
Pain self-efficacy also influenced outcome for patients with low levels of baseline pain and disability: 
1 
for patients with low baseline SPADI and SPADI pain scores (<68 and <75 respectively), low pain 
2 
self-efficacy (PSEQ<40 and <41 respectively) increased the likelihood of persistent pain. Perhaps 
3 
surprisingly, patients reporting low baseline pain but low pain self-efficacy (n=161, 20% of cohort) 
4 
had a similar or worse outcome on the SPADI pain subscale to patients with high baseline pain but 
5 
high pain self-efficacy (n=48, 6% of cohort). 
6 
 
7 
Our regression tree analyses provide a useful and simple clinical guide, highlighting the influence of 
8 
patient beliefs and expectations of treatment on outcome, irrespective of baseline pain and disability. 
9 
Whilst these finding are consistent with those from the GLM analysis,13 the CART analysis selects 
10 
variables based on prediction power rather than statistical significance or p values. Variables are 
11 
included in order of importance; the most predictive variable is included first, the analysis then 
12 
searches for the second most important variable among the rest, and so on. The prediction error curve 
13 
estimated using cross-validation gives a clear indication at what point in the selection process the 
14 
additional predictors are not contributing enough to the prediction model.  The prediction based 
15 
variable selection combined with cross-validation for assessing model performance ensures that only 
16 
the relevant and most predictive variables are included in the optimal model. 
17 
 
18 
CART analysis has advantages over traditional regression modelling in that it does not require a 
19 
specified distribution of outcome data or a large sample size27. In terms of predictive power CART 
20 
analysis is comparable to traditional modelling.21 However CART does have limitations. Defining 
21 
subgroups based on data driven cut-points for continuous measures (i.e. the PSEQ) is subject to 
22 
sampling variability, but the CART methodology does not provide a measure of uncertainty (e.g., 
23 
standard errors or confidence intervals) associated with the cut-off points. A different cut off point 
24 
may be selected in a different sample, but it was not our intention to provide a ready to deploy clinical 
25 
tool with definitive cut-off points at this stage. We rather aimed to demonstrate that an easily 
26 
interpretable prediction tool with potential for clinical applications can be developed which can be 
27 
further examined in bigger and external cohorts to derive more generalisable cut-offs. However, use 
28 
of cross-validation approach for model selection should make the derived models sufficiently robust 
29 
at least for the population represented by the study cohort. Also, being a multicentre study with broad 
30 
eligibility criteria increases the generalisability of the results to the wide range of patients and 
31 
presentations of shoulder pain commonly seen by physiotherapists within primary and secondary care.  
32 
This is further supported by similar patterns of the distributions of the QuickDASH outcome based on 
33 
classification of participants using the SPADI trees in our informal internal validation.  
34 
 
35 
With regards to non-surgically managed shoulder pain, this study is one of only two known using a 
36 
CART analysis to investigate the hierarchy of predictive factors associated with outcome. Vergouw et 
37 
 13 
 
al28 compared the results of CART and logistic linear regression for 587 patients with musculoskeletal 
1 
shoulder pain attending General Practice in the Netherlands, however, they did not include patient 
2 
expectation of change as a result of physiotherapy and pain self-efficacy. A positive association 
3 
between patient expectation and outcome has been consistently reported for a range of health 
4 
conditions,29-31 although ours is the first to investigate patient expectation of outcome in non-
5 
surgically managed shoulder pain. The association between pain self-efficacy and chronic non-cancer 
6 
pain has also been consistently reported for a range of health conditions.32 Ours is one of only two 
7 
studies to investigate self-efficacy in non-surgically management for shoulder pain. A randomised 
8 
controlled trial of 102 participants,33 did not find an association between baseline pain self-efficacy 
9 
and the outcome of supervised exercise or radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy. 
10 
Based on our findings that pain self-efficacy and patient expectation are important predictors of 
11 
outcome we recommend that they be formally assessed in all patients with musculoskeletal pain. 
12 
There is currently no standardised method of measuring patient expectation and we therefore 
13 
recommend using a patient rated Likert scale that includes a worsening as well as improvement of 
14 
shoulder pain.29 There are several validated measurement tools for pain self-efficacy and for the busy 
15 
clinician we recommend using shortened patient rated versions such as the PSEQ-234 comprising two 
16 
items. Standardised questionnaires like the PSEQ-2 and a single question on expectation of outcome 
17 
provide an opportunity to openly discuss patient beliefs and expectations which healthcare 
18 
practitioners may find challenging otherwise.35, 36 Such patient-clinician dialogues around the 
19 
potential impact of expectations and beliefs further supports shared decision-making. Our results 
20 
suggest that cut points will vary according to baseline pain and disability and therefore the use of 
21 
specific cut-points for stratification is not justified. Further research is also needed to validate our 
22 
point estimates in an external cohort. 
23 
It is plausible that patient expectation and pain self-efficacy are mediating factors.29 Adherence to 
24 
non-surgical management is reportedly low.37  The therapeutic effect of a home exercise and/or self-
25 
management programme cannot be realised if not enacted by the patient.38 One of the suggested 
26 
mechanisms by which higher patient expectation is associated with outcome is through an increased 
27 
motivation to engage and adhere to an intervention that participants believe will have a beneficial 
28 
outcome.39 
29 
Although not previously reported for those experiencing shoulder pain, high self-efficacy has been 
30 
shown to be significantly associated with greater exercise adherence 40-42 as well as other  health 
31 
behaviours such as physical activity43-45 and taking medications as prescribed.46 A consistent and 
32 
statistically significant association between all three factors; changes in self-efficacy, adherence and 
33 
 14 
 
outcome, has yet to be demonstrated. Further studies are needed to explore if moderating self-efficacy 
1 
affects outcome.  
2 
Further development and testing of, educational interventions targeting healthcare practitioners with 
3 
strategies to increase patients’ pain self-efficacy and expectations of treatment is needed. A number of 
4 
promising interventions exist for increasing patients’ self-efficacy and include positive feedback on 
5 
performance, observation of mastery in others, graded activity, identifying realistic goals for which 
6 
the patient is likely to succeed and selecting tasks and activities relevant to the patient.32,43 Variability 
7 
in reported effectiveness suggests that the purpose, content and delivery may need to be tailored to 
8 
each patient, requiring a person centred approach.

Conclusion 
11 
This is the first known study to subgroup people with shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin 
12 
attending physiotherapy into risk groups for persistent pain and disability based on a range of baseline 
13 
personal, clinical, activity, and participatory variables. This multicentre study provides evidence that 
14 
for a given baseline measure of shoulder pain and disability, pain self-efficacy and patient expectation 
15 
of change as a result of physiotherapy, are the most influential predictors of patient rated outcome at 
16 
six month follow up. Additionally, this is the first study to demonstrate that for people with shoulder 
17 
pain higher pain self-efficacy reduced the likelihood of continued high levels of pain and disability at 
18 
six-month follow up, for those with high baseline pain or disability. The likelihood of persistent pain 
19 
increased in the subgroup that were categorised as having low levels of baseline pain and disability 
20 
and concomitant low pain self-efficacy. Of importance those identified as having low baseline pain 
21 
and low self-efficacy had similar or worse outcome on the SPADI pain subscale to those with high 
22 
baseline pain and high pain self-efficacy. 
23 
 
24 
Although our findings are applicable to people referred to physiotherapy for the management of 
25 
shoulder pain of any duration and in primary and secondary care, they are likely to be applicable 
26 
beyond this group. 
27 
Based on our findings we suggest that pain self-efficacy and patient expectation should be formally 
28 
assessed and discussed at the first physiotherapy appointment. Further research should investigate 
29 
whether these factors can be targeted and modified by therapeutic interventions and improve patient 
30 
outcomes.
