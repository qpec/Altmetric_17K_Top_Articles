In the United States, an estimated 7% of new diagnoses of 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in 2012 were 
attributed to injection drug use, and an additional 3% to male-
to-male sexual contact and injection drug use (1). To monitor 
HIV prevalence and behaviors associated with HIV risk and 
prevention among persons who inject drugs (PWID), CDC’s 
National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system conducts 
interviews and HIV testing in selected cities. This report summa-
rizes HIV prevalence and behaviors among PWID interviewed 
and tested in 20 cities in 2012. Of the 10,002 PWID tested, 11% 
had a positive HIV test result. Among 9,425 PWID included in 
the behavioral analysis, 30% receptively shared syringes, 70% 
had vaginal sex without a condom, 25% had heterosexual anal 
sex without a condom, and 5% of males had male-to-male sexual 
contact without a condom in the previous 12 months. Fifty-one 
percent of PWID included in the behavioral analysis had been 
tested for HIV, 25% participated in an HIV behavioral interven-
tion, and 39% participated in substance abuse treatment in the 
previous 12 months. Additional efforts are needed to reduce risk 
behaviors and increase access to HIV testing, drug treatment, 
and other HIV prevention programs to further reduce HIV 
infections among PWID.
In 2012, NHBS staff collected cross-sectional behavioral 
survey data and conducted HIV testing among PWID 
recruited using respondent-driven sampling* (2–4) in 20 
cities† with high prevalence of acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS). Persons who volunteered to participate, 
were eligible§, and consented were administered a stan-
dardized, anonymous questionnaire face-to-face by trained 
interviewers. All participants were offered anonymous HIV 
testing, performed by collecting blood or oral specimens for 
either rapid testing in the field or laboratory-based testing. A 
nonreactive screening test result was considered HIV-negative; 
a reactive screening test result was considered HIV-positive if 
confirmed by Western blot or indirect immunofluorescence 
assay. Incentives were offered for interview completion, HIV 
testing, and recruitment.¶
PWID with HIV-positive test results during the survey were 
defined as aware of their HIV infection if they reported a previ-
ous HIV-positive test result. Because studies have found that 
knowledge of personal HIV status might influence risk behav-
iors (5), behavioral analysis was limited to participants who 
did not report a previous HIV-positive test result. Participants 
were asked whether they had, in the 12 months before the 
interview, engaged in high-risk injection or sex behaviors, 
been tested for HIV infection, or participated in an HIV 
behavioral intervention.** In addition, participants were asked 
whether they had ever been tested for HIV or hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection.†† Data from each city were analyzed using 
a respondent-driven sampling analysis tool that adjusted for 
differences in peer recruitment patterns and PWID network 
size and estimated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the 
Salganik bootstrap variance estimator (6). City-level analyses 
were aggregated and weighted by the estimated size of the 
PWID population in each city (7) to obtain estimates overall.§§
HIV Infection and HIV-Associated Behaviors Among Persons  
Who Inject Drugs — 20 Cities, United States, 2012

* Recruitment chains in each city began with three to 15 initial participants 
identified during formative assessment. Initial participants who completed the 
interview were asked to recruit up to five other PWID using a coded coupon 
system designed to track referrals. Referred and surveyed PWID were also asked 
to recruit up to five other PWID.
† State and local health departments eligible to participate in NHBS are among those 
whose jurisdictions include a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or a specified division 
with high burden of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. In 2012, NHBS was 
conducted in 20 MSAs/divisions. Throughout this report, MSAs and divisions are 
referred to as cities. The 20 cities were Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, 
Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, T
exas; Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; 
Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Nassau-Suffolk, New York; 
New Orleans, Louisiana; New York, New York; Newark, New Jersey; Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania; San Diego, California; San Francisco, California; San Juan, Puerto Rico; 
Seattle, Washington; and Washington, District of Columbia.
§ Persons were eligible to participate if they had injected drugs during the previous 
12 months, resided in the city, were aged ≥18 years, and could complete the 
interview in English or Spanish.
 ¶ The incentive format (cash or gift card) and amount varied by city based on 
formative assessment and local policy. A typical format included $25 for 
completing the interview, $25 for providing a specimen for HIV testing, and 
$10 for each successful recruitment (maximum of five).
 
** Receptive sharing of syringes was defined as “using needles that someone else had 
already injected with,” and receptive sharing of injection equipment was defined 
as using equipment such as cookers, cottons, or water used to rinse needles or 
prepare drugs “that someone else had already used.” Condomless vaginal sex/
condomless anal sex was defined as “sex without a condom.” Persons tested for 
HIV infection include those with results that were negative, indeterminate, or 
unknown. Participating in an individual or group HIV behavioral intervention 
(e.g., a one-on-one conversation with a counselor or an organized discussion 
regarding HIV prevention) did not include counseling received as part of an HIV 
test or conversations with friends. Male-to-male anal sexual contact was restricted 
to males and included both insertive and receptive anal sexual contact.
 
†† Testing for HCV infection was measured as ever tested or ever received a 
diagnosis of hepatitis C.
 
§§ For city-level estimates for which CIs could not be calculated, maximally wide 
CIs (0–1) were used in aggregation. City-level estimates with insufficient data 
for analysis were excluded from aggregation. Such estimates represented 4% 
of the estimates included in this analysis.

In 2012, a total of 13,093 persons were recruited to par-
ticipate; of these, 2,812 (21%) were ineligible. An additional 
279 (2%) eligible participants were excluded from analysis.¶¶ 
Data for the remaining 10,002 participants were used in the 
analysis of HIV prevalence (Table 1).
Among 10,002 PWID, 11% (CI = 9%–12%) tested positive 
for HIV. The percentage of PWID with HIV infection was 
higher among non-Hispanic blacks (16%) (CI = 13%–18%) 
than non-Hispanic whites (5%) (CI = 3%–7%). PWID in 
the South U.S. Census region had higher HIV prevalence 
(13%) (CI = 11%–16%) than those in the Midwest (8%) 
(CI = 5%–11%) and West regions (7%) (CI = 5%–10%). The 
prevalence of HIV infection was lower among PWID who most 
frequently inject heroin only (7%) (CI = 6%–9%) than among 
PWID who most frequently inject drugs other than heroin or 
multiple drugs (17%) (CI = 13%–21%). Prevalence of HIV 
infection was 27% (CI = 20%–33%) among male PWID who 
reported male-to-male sex in the previous 12 months. Among 
HIV-positive PWID, 63% (CI = 55%–70%) were aware of 
their infection.
Among the 9,425 PWID included in behavioral analysis, 
30% (CI = 28%–32%) receptively shared syringes, 70% 
(CI = 68%–72%) had vaginal sex without a condom, 25% 
(CI = 23%–27%) had heterosexual anal sex without a condom, 
and 49% (CI = 47%–51%) had more than one opposite sex 
partner in the previous 12 months (Table 2). The percentages 
of PWID who receptively shared injection equipment or had 
more than one opposite sex partner in the previous 12 months 
were highest among PWID aged 18–29 years. Among male 
PWID, 10% (CI = 8%–11%) reported male-to-male sexual 
contact, and 5% (CI = 4%–6%) reported male-to-male sexual 
contact without a condom in the previous 12 months.
In addition, 25% (CI = 23%–27%) of PWID participated in 
an HIV behavioral intervention, 39% (CI = 36%–41%) par-
ticipated in drug treatment, and 51% (CI = 49%–54%) had an 
HIV test in the previous 12 months (Table 3). Ever being tested 
for HCV was reported by 78% (CI = 76%–80%) of PWID.
PWID with health insurance were more likely to have 
been tested for HIV in the previous 12 months (55%) 
(CI = 53%–58%) than were PWID without health insurance 
(44%) (CI = 41%–47%) (Table 3).*** Similarly, more PWID 
with health insurance reported having participated in an HIV

exclusion were not mutually exclusive.
 *** Participants were asked whether they “currently have health insurance or 
health care coverage.” Health insurance was defined for participants as “health 
plans people get through employment or purchased directly, as well as 
government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that provide medical care

different from that found in 2009 (55%) (4). The percentages 
of PWID who engaged in risk behaviors in 2012 also were 
consistent with 2009 data (4).
Discussion
The 2012 data in this report provide updated estimates of the 
prevalence of HIV infection and behaviors since the last NHBS 
survey of PWID in 2009 (4). The change in the percentage of 
PWID with HIV infection from 2009 to 2012 was not statisti-
cally significant. The percentage of PWID with HIV-positive 
test results who were aware of their infection in 2012 also was 
not significantly different from that found in 2009 (4).
The percentages of PWID who engaged in risk behaviors 
in 2012 are consistent with 2009 data (4). These percentages 
highlight a role for expanded HIV testing and prevention 
among PWID. The high-risk behaviors observed among

PWID represent an opportunity to prevent future increases 
in HIV infections caused by sharing injection equipment or 
having sex without a condom.
Compared with the last NHBS survey of PWID in 2009, 
higher percentages of participants in this 2012 study reported 
participating in HIV behavioral interventions in the previous 12 
months (25% in 2012 compared with 19% in 2009) and having 
ever been tested for HCV infection (78% and 72%, respectively) 
(4). Similar percentages of PWID reported being tested for HIV 
in the previous 12 months (51% and 49%, respectively).
This analysis found that PWID with health insurance were 
more likely to have been tested for HIV infection in the pre-
vious 12 months, to have participated in an HIV behavioral 
intervention in the previous 12 months, and to have ever been 
tested for HCV than were PWID without health insurance. 
These differences suggest that expanding health insurance 
coverage might allow more PWID to become aware of their 
HIV and HCV status and to have access to important treat-
ment and prevention interventions.
Consistent with previous reports (4,8), this analysis found 
that younger PWID were more likely to have shared injection 
equipment or have had more than one opposite sex partner in 
the previous 12 months than were older PWID. The percent-
ages of PWID who were tested for HIV infection or partici-
pated in an HIV behavioral intervention were similar among 
younger and older PWID.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four 
limitations. First, some participants might not have accurately 
reported their behavior to interviewers, and results might be 
affected by social desirability bias. Second, because no method 
of obtaining standard probability samples of PWID exists, 
the representativeness of the NHBS sample cannot be deter-
mined. Although respondent-driven sampling adjusts for some 
sampling biases (2), biases related to participants’ recruitment 
behavior or their willingness and ability to participate in the 
interview might have affected the sample. Third, the numbers 
of participants in some cities were insufficient to permit every 
estimate to be made in every city. Finally, PWID were inter-
viewed in 20 cities with high AIDS prevalence; findings from 
these cities might not be generalizable to other cities or states.
To reduce the number of new HIV infections, the National 
HIV/AIDS Strategy††† calls for intensifying prevention efforts 
in communities where HIV is most heavily concentrated. At 
the center of any response to HIV among PWID is a com-
prehensive, multifaceted prevention strategy, which includes 
access to sterile injection and drug preparation equipment; 
treatment for substance use and mental disorders; opioid 
substitution therapy; counseling, testing, and treatment for 
HIV infection; education on drug-related and sex-related 
risks and risk-reduction for PWID and their sex partners; and 
preexposure prophylaxis for adult PWID at substantial risk for 
HIV acquisition (9,10). An effective prevention approach for 
PWID also includes prevention and treatment of other infec-
tions, including HCV; thus, integration of multiple service 
programs for PWID might increase the effectiveness of HIV 
prevention efforts (9).

What is already known on this topic?
Persons who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States are at 
increased risk for acquiring human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection. In 2009, the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance 
(NHBS) system, which uses respondent-driven sampling to 
interview and test for HIV infection PWID living in 20 large cities, 
found an overall HIV prevalence of 9%.
What is added by this report?
The NHBS in 2012 found an HIV prevalence of 11% (95% 
confidence interval = 9%–12%) among PWID; of those, 63% had 
been previously aware of their infection, compared with 55% in 
2009, not a statistically significant difference. Among PWID 
reporting negative or unknown HIV status in 2012, 30% 
reported sharing syringes, and 70% reported having vaginal sex 
without a condom in the previous 12 months.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Many PWID are at risk for acquiring HIV infection because of their 
drug use practices and sexual behaviors, but more than one third 
of HIV-positive PWID in urban areas with high HIV prevalence 
were unaware of their infection. Additionally, three quarters of 
PWID had not participated in an HIV behavioral intervention in 
the previous 12 months. To prevent infections, PWID need ready 
access to sterile injection and drug preparation equipment; 
treatment for substance use and mental disorders; opioid 
substitution therapy; counseling, testing, and treatment for HIV 
infection; education on drug-related and sex-related risks and 
risk-reduction; and preexposure prophylaxis if they are adults and 
at substantial risk for acquiring HIV infection.
