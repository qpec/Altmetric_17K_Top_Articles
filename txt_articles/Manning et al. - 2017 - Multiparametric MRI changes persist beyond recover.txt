Multiparametric MRI changes persist
beyond recovery in concussed adolescent
hockey players
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine whether multiparametric MRI data can provide insight into the acute and
long-lasting neuronal sequelae after a concussion in adolescent athletes.
Methods: Players were recruited from Bantam hockey leagues in which body checking is first
introduced (male, age 11–14 years). Clinical measures, diffusion metrics, resting-state network
and region-to-region functional connectivity patterns, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy
absolute metabolite concentrations were analyzed from an independent, age-matched control
group of hockey players (n 5 26) and longitudinally in concussed athletes within 24 to 72 hours
(n 5 17) and 3 months (n 5 14) after a diagnosed concussion.
Results: There were diffusion abnormalities within multiple white matter tracts, functional hyper-
connectivity, and decreases in choline 3 months after concussion. Tract-specific spatial statistics
revealed a large region along the superior longitudinal fasciculus with the largest decreases in dif-
fusivity measures, which significantly correlated with clinical deficits. This region also spatially
intersected with probabilistic tracts connecting cortical regions where we found acute functional
connectivity changes. Hyperconnectivity patterns at 3 months after concussion were present on-
ly in players with relatively less severe clinical outcomes, higher choline concentrations, and dif-
fusivity indicative of relatively less axonal disruption.
Conclusions: Changes persisted well after players’ clinical scores had returned to normal and they
had been cleared to return to play. Ongoing white matter maturation may make adolescent ath-
letes particularly vulnerable to brain injury, and they may require extended recovery periods. The
consequences of early brain injury for ongoing brain development and risk of more serious con-
ditions such as second impact syndrome or neural degenerative processes need to be elucidated.

Concussion remains a critical health problem, and the developing brain may be uniquely sus-
ceptible.1 In Canada, hockey-related concussions account for nearly half of all sports team–
related concussions and disproportionately affect adolescents.2 The neuronal mechanisms that
underlie concussion remain poorly understood. A complex cascade of structural, functional, and
metabolic changes are secondary to rotational acceleration of the brain.3 MRI studies have re-
ported neuronal vulnerabilities that persist after athletes have been cleared to return to play.4–7
Without full recovery, players may have increased susceptibility to injury and may be at risk of
serious conditions such as second impact syndrome.8 Therefore, it is essential to understand the

 immediate effects of concussion on the ado-
lescent brain and the nature of any long-lasting
neuronal changes detectable with noninvasive
multiparametric imaging.
In this study, concussed adolescent male
hockey players were evaluated longitudinally
after concussion and compared to independent,
age-matched nonconcussed players as controls.
While clinical measures in this population indi-
cate recovery and prompt return to play, given
previous imaging findings, we hypothesized that
there would be persistent MRI-detectable neu-
ronal changes that reflect long-lasting damage
to white matter fibers and compensatory recov-
ery mechanisms. Given this multiparametric
MRI dataset, we were able to directly relate
resting-state (RS-fMRI) changes with underly-
ing structural abnormalities through diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI),9 brain metabolic changes
through
magnetic
resonance
spectroscopy
(MRS), and acute clinical deficits.
METHODS Players diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain
injury or concussion (age 13.3 6 0.6 years) were assessed within
24 to 72 hours of their injury (n 5 17) and again 3 months later
(n 5 14). An independent group of healthy, age-matched,
nonconcussed male hockey players were assessed and acted as
our controls (n 5 26, age 13.0 6 1 years). Portions of this study
design have been described previously.10 Further clinical methods
are described in appendix e-1 at Neurology.org. The numbers of
included participants for each portion of the study are summa-
rized in table e-1. MRI acquisition parameters are outlined in
appendix e-2.

RS-fMRI analysis. RS-fMRI data were analyzed with FSL
(FMRIB Software Library) 5.0.6 (Oxford, England) with 2 major
aims: to investigate RS network (RSN) reorganization and whole-
brain region-to-region connectivity patterns. Standard pre-
processing steps included brain extraction, a high-pass filter (0.01
Hz), spatial smoothing with a 5-mm full-width half-maximum
gaussian filter, and motion correction using linear image regis-
tration relative to the middle volume. Data with excessive motion
(.1-mm maximum displacement or .0.5-mm relative mean
displacement) were excluded from further analyses. Preprocessed
images were denoised with single-session independent compo-
nent analysis and automatic dimensionality estimation. Compo-
nents that were designated as noise (related voxels outside the
brain, within the corticospinal fluid, primarily high-frequency
profile, or motion artifacts) were regressed from the data. Each
dataset was registered to standard space with a 2-stage affine
registration technique that first registered the low-resolution
functional data to the brain-extracted anatomic image and then
to a 2-mm isotropic Montreal Neurologic Institute T1-weighted
reference image using 12 df.
Multisession temporal concatenation–independent compo-
nent analysis was used to create average RSN maps followed by
dual regression to generate session-specific networks.11 In partic-
ular, the visual occipital pole, default mode (DMN), sensorimo-
tor, executive control, and cerebellar networks were investigated.
The FSL randomize permutation-testing tool was implemented
to assess group differences according to a general linear model
with
threshold-free
cluster
enhancement
and
multiple-
comparison Bonferroni-corrected p values (p , 0.001). In addi-
tion, a regional connectivity analysis was performed on the
preprocessed data with the CONN toolbox12 because of the
statistical advantages as it complements the network analysis
and expands to look at whole-brain regional connectivity.
Participant-specific CSF and white matter masks were used as
regressors. Data were parcellated into 136 functionally relevant
regions with the Harvard-Oxford cortical atlas and cerebellar
regions with the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas. Whole-
brain region-to-region connectivity differences were assessed with
false discovery rate correction.
Diffusion tensor and tractography analysis. Raw diffusion
datasets were corrected for eddy current distortions and relative
head motion with the eddy command line tool. The non–
diffusion-weighted (b 5 0) volume was used to create a modestly
extracted brain mask. A diffusion tensor was fit voxel-wise with
the use of specific inputs of the gradient directions and b values
(b 5 1,000 s/mm2) directly from the scanner. Several diffusion
metric spatial maps were created, including fractional anisotropy
(FA) and mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial (RD) diffusivity. With
the use of the John Hopkins University high-probability white
matter tractography atlas,13 these DTI metrics were extracted and
analyzed within the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), cingulum,
forceps major and minor of the corpus callosum, uncinate
fasciculus, corticospinal tract (CST), anterior thalamic radiation,
and inferior fronto-occipital and longitudinal fasciculus.
Once tracts with significant changes were identified with
a multivariate analysis of variance, an iterative randomization tool
within FSL was used to spatially quantify where the greatest
changes occurred along those tracts while regressing for age.
DTI metrics within the regions with the greatest changes were ex-
tracted and analyzed. These regions are referred to as DTImax and
are described in Results. Probabilistic tractography with iterative
Monte Carlo simulations of principal diffusion tensor vectors was
used to quantify a probabilistic streamline between regions of
interest (ROIs). Probabilistic structural connections were inves-
tigated between relevant parceled RS-fMRI regions to spatially
relate structural and functional changes. To quantify these results,
2 identical spherical ROIs (5-mm radius) were placed before and
after DTImax (that overlapped along the probabilistic tract con-
necting acute RS-fMRI ROIs that we identified, figure 1A). The
probability distribution was displayed per participant and quan-
tified the probability of a structural connection between the seed
and waypoint masks (normalized by the total number of tracts
modeled).
MRS analysis. Spectra were postprocessed with in-house software
to measure absolute N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine, glutamate,
glutamine, and myo-inositol as previously described.14–16 Briefly,
analysis software created in our laboratory in IDL (version 5.4,
Research Systems Inc, Boulder, CO) was used to correct spectral line
shapes by combined QUALITY deconvolution and eddy current
correction.17 Spectra were fitted in the time domain with the use of
a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization routine14 with prior knowl-
edge of metabolic line shapes. Prior knowledge was acquired from
in vitro spectra obtained from aqueous solutions of metabolites before
the study.14 We report absolute metabolite levels using unsuppressed

 water from the ROI as an internal standard as previously described in
detail.14,16 In addition, absolute concentrations included a correction
for tissue partial volume and T1 and T2 relaxation–related signal loss.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with
a multivariate analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc testing
using GraphPad Prism (version 6.0). A hypothesis-driven 2-
tailed Pearson correlation analysis was explored between data
that had a significant effect for group (p , 0.05 after false dis-
covery rate correction).
RESULTS Clinical results are summarized in appendix
e-3 and figure e-1.
RS-fMRI results. We found significant increases in con-
nectivity at 3 months after concussion in several RSNs.
In particular, there was significantly increased connec-
tivity at 3 months after concussion compared to con-
trols with the occipital pole visual network and
cerebellar network (figure 2, B and C). Compared to
24 to 72 hours after concussion, there were significant
increases in connectivity by 3 months with the senso-
rimotor network (figure 2D) and cerebellar network.
There was increased DMN connectivity at 3 months
compared to controls that did not survive statistical
Bonferroni correction (p , 0.01, figure 2A), and no
significant differences were found within the executive
control network or between controls and the 24- to
72-hour postconcussion group in any network.
There were a few subtle changes in region-to-
region connectivity within 24 to 72 hours after con-
cussion compared to controls (figure 1B); however,
some were striking with a large effect size (.0.8) and
prompted further analysis to directly relate with our
DTI findings (figure 1C). Specifically, there were sig-
nificant anticorrelations between the anterior supra-
marginal gyrus and areas that mimic the DMN,
including the angular gyrus and frontal pole (p ,
0.05, including portions of the medial prefrontal cor-
tex, figure 1C). This was not found in our network
analysis, possibly as a result of statistical power (voxel-
level correction) or the dominance of the frontal pole.
There was an increase in regional connectivity imme-
diately

 between the cerebellum and parahippocampal gyrus.
The significant whole-brain region-to-region connec-
tivity changes are shown in figure 3, and similar to the
RSN results, there were increases in connectivity at 3
months compared to both the control and 24- to 72-
hour postconcussion groups between regions that
complimented
our
network-level
connectivity
changes.
Diffusion results. There was a significant main effect
for group differences in the CST, cingulum, and
SLF (F . 4.18, p , 0.05, figure 4). Along the
CST, the greatest diffusion changes were located infe-
riorly near the brainstem (p , 0.1), and there were
small, more scattered maximums along the cingulum
(p . 0.1). A large region along the right SLF shown
in figure 1 had significant MD, RD, and AD changes
at 3 months after concussion (p , 0.01), and a mask
was created over this localized hotspot of compro-
mised neuronal integrity, DTImax. Within DTImax,
the MD and RD values were significantly decreased at
both 24 to 72 hours and 3 months after concussion
compared to controls (F . 10.0, p , 0.01); further-
more, there were decreases in AD at both time points
(F 5 6.67, p 5 0.060 and p 5 0.003, respectively)
with increases in FA by 3 months (F 5 3.91, p 5
0.025). Using the anterior supramarginal gyrus as
a seed and the frontal pole as a waypoint, we con-
firmed that probabilistic tracts structurally connected
regions where we found acute RS-fMRI differences
(figure 1). The probability of a structural connection
did not significantly decrease after concussion.
Spectroscopy results. The spectroscopy voxel was
placed in the prefrontal region with the following
mean 6 SD tissue content: gray matter 19% 6
7%, white matter 78% 6 8%, and CSF 3% 6
2%. The tissue composition of the voxel did not
significantly change across participants or sessions.
No changes in N-acetylaspartate were found
between any of the groups. Choline was significantly
reduced at 3 months relative to controls (F 5 4.2,
p 5 0.02, figure 4), with a 10% decrease in the mean
observed (p 5 0.035). A reduction in glutamine levels
was observed but was not significantly different from
controls (F 5 2.3, p 5 0.09). Correlation results are
summarized in detail in table e-2, and examples are
shown in figure 5.

 DISCUSSION In this study of adolescent hockey
players from Bantam leagues in which body checking
is first introduced, we found acute and longitudinal
multiparametric MRI changes after concussion com-
pared to controls. As expected, clinical composite
scores elevated immediately after concussion, and
within weeks of injury, they returned to control levels
and players were cleared to return to play. However,
we found persistent RS-fMRI connectivity changes,
diffusion-related white matter abnormalities, and
MRS metabolite decreases in the prefrontal white
matter at 3 months after concussion.
The adolescent brain is still not fully developed
during this age range (11–14 years), and as it contin-
ues to grow and mature, it may be more vulnerable to
brain dysfunction and elongated periods of recovery
after an acceleration-related injury. It has been shown
that this heightened vulnerability may be due to both
biomechanical (neck strength) and neurobiological
(incomplete white matter myelination) characteris-
tics.18 Axonal excitability and electrophysiologic
recordings in a rat fluid percussion brain injury model
have been used to assess differences in axonal vulner-
ability between myelinated and unmyelinated fibers
during injury response and functional recovery.19 In
this animal model, myelinated axons recovered within
7 days and were relatively protected compared to
unmyelinated fibers, which were more severely
injured and took longer to recover. It is critical to
understand how the adolescent human brain reacts
and recovers from concussion. A recent review of
concussion-related MRI findings demonstrated the
advantages of relating multiple MRI modalities,20
and here we aim to do just that to better understand
the meaning of these changes.
We found diffuse changes in DTI metrics along 3
major white matter tracts. However, the tract-specific
spatial changes were localized to a single, central region
along the SLF (DTImax) where we found decreased AD,
MD, and RD at both times after concussion. In vivo
animal studies have been able to directly relate histology
with MRI diffusion, specifically finding a direct

 relationship between AD and axonal injury through
postmortem neurofilament immunostaining and confir-
mation of the presence of b-amyloid precursor pro-
tein.21 Diffuse axonal pathology has been observed in
all traumatic brain injury severities, in which transport is
disrupted and axonal bulb formations occur.22 The de-
creases in AD observed after concussion may reflect this
axonal pathology because they relate directly to imme-
diate symptoms. The AD within DTImax at 24 to 72
hours after concussion was significantly correlated with
total symptom scores and the number of errors during
balance testing, indicating that a more severe injury is
associated with more severe axonal damage. This re-
mained true at 3 months after concussion when the
sustained decrease in AD within DTImax was associated
with a higher symptom severity score.
The most common injury mechanism in our
cohort was falling, affecting the back of the head. In-
vestigations of the biomechanical deformations and
shearing forces after even minimal acceleration of
the human head have reported deformation of the
human brain. Rapid deceleration directed to the back

 of the head results in anterior shortening and poste-
rior elongation, as well as deformations in the axial
plane.23 These results correspond to regions where
we found diffusion changes indicative of structural
damage to the long tracts running anterior to poste-
rior. This acceleration injury and the consequent
strain and shearing forces between brain tissues may
damage axons themselves. The decrease in AD was
concurrent with decreases in RD and MD and in-
creases in FA within the same region. This could
reflect different pathologies such as axonal disruption,
cytotoxic edema, axonal swelling, or changes in myelin
at the site of injury.24 These findings are similar to some
previous DTI studies5,9,25–27 but not all.28,29 Cohorts of
different ages, injury severity, and acquisition timing all
may play a role in the direction of these changing

 diffusion metrics. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery
and turbo spin echo sequences were used to confirm
a mild traumatic brain injury with no cerebral edema.
We observed region-to-region RS-fMRI hyperconnec-
tivity at 3 months after concussion compared to both
controls and 24 to 72 hours after concussion. This was
also true at the network level. Previous studies have
variably found this pattern, and hyperconnectivity has
been proposed to be involved in recovery and compen-
sation for underlying white matter disruption.4,30–33
Here, we demonstrate the strength of multipara-
metric MRI by relating our connectivity findings
directly to DTI and clinical data. Acute regional con-
nectivity changes with the cerebellum correlated with
all of the significant measures reflecting acute postural
balance deficits and directly relate the role of the cer-
ebellum in balance performance.34 The average AD
along the SLF and within DTImax was correlated with
changes in interregional connectivity in which, in
general, more axonal injury (lower diffusivity) and
a more severe injury as quantified by number and
severity of symptoms or more days required to recover
were associated with lower absolute values of connec-
tivity. Only those players with a less severe injury as
indicated by these acute clinical measures exhibited
regional hyperconnectivity at 3 months after concus-
sion, similar to previous work focused on the DMN
in more severe and older patients with traumatic
brain injury 6 months after their injury.35 This pos-
sible recovery mechanism may be compensating for
the underlying damaged avenues of structural con-
nections by recruiting regions of connectivity and
enhancing both correlated and inhibitory communi-
cation. It is possible that some players have not yet
reached or completed the recovery phase, and further
longitudinal data are needed to understand the timing
and potential long-term consequences of these
mechanisms.
A 10% reduction in the MRS choline signal was
observed at 3 months relative to controls. The choline
signal is made up of different components, mainly
phosphorylcholine (a precursor to membrane synthe-
sis) and glycerophosphorylcholine (a breakdown
product of the membrane).36 This change is particu-
larly interesting because reductions in blood plasma
glycerophospholipids at 24 to 72 hours were reported
in a subset of these hockey players.10 Other studies
have also reported reduced choline levels in the motor
cortex after a month of high school football in non-
concussed players.37 This was suggested to be due to
a decrease in membrane turnover as a result of repet-
itive subconcussive impacts. The correlations with the
MRS data support similar interpretations. The cho-
line concentration at both 24 to 72 hours and 3
months after concussion was significantly correlated
with RS-fMRI connectivity; in particular, a lower
choline concentration was associated with a lower
absolute interregional connectivity value. Given the
relationship between choline concentrations and the
clinical, diffusion, and connectivity measures, we
hypothesize that the decrease in choline is related to
reduced membrane turnover rate.36
There are limitations in the present study that
will motivate future MRI investigations of adoles-
cent concussion. The average changes we report
here represent a heterogeneous population whose
individual injury mechanisms, severities, and recov-
ery times vary. We followed up with players
3 months after their injury; however, the players
had clinically recovered and were cleared to return
to play at different times. It is possible that return-
ing to play may affect the brain and any ongoing
neuroreparative mechanisms. Given the long-lasting
changes we found at 3 months, future longitudinal stud-
ies should continue to follow this demographic as they
develop to understand exactly how long the recovery
period lasts as a function of age and the consequences,
if any, later in life, including increased vulnerability
to
future
concussions
and
the
development
of
neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic
encephalopathy.38,39
The persistent changes we observed in this study
provide evidence of prolonged axonal disruption in
a localized area along the SLF. This result was spa-
tially related to acute RS-fMRI connectivity changes
and choline metabolite decreases and correlated sig-
nificantly with clinical deficits. Diffuse hyperconnec-
tivity
patterns
were
present
3
months
after
concussion, well after clearance to return to play
and symptomatic recovery. This adolescent popula-
tion may be particularly vulnerable to injury while ax-
ons continue to myelinate and mature, and our
results suggest that they may require longer recovery
periods.

Reader response: Pilocytic astrocytoma with anaplasia arising from
the optic chiasm in a very elderly patient
Andrea Wasilewski (Rochester)
Neurology® 2018;90:1037. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000005596
As alluded to by the authors of this NeuroImage,1 few studies have investigated pilocytic astro-
cytoma (PA) in adults, given the rarity of these tumors. One study suggested anaplastic PAs have
a more aggressive clinical course when compared to juvenile PA with a higher incidence of tumor
recurrence (from 30% to 42%) and progression.2 Specifically, PA with anaplastic features
are more aggressive and associated with decreased survival when compared with typical PA.3 No
standard of care exists for treatment of PA, especially in the elderly. Anti-angiogenic treatment,
such as bevacizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial
growth factor), should be considered in patients with recurrent or unresectable PA. The highly
vascular nature of these tumors suggests they may be uniquely responsive to bevacizumab
and may have a similar response as seen in glioblastoma, including decreased permeability of
vasculatureand decreasedperilesional edema.4 Case series demonstrated clinical and radiographic
improvement as well as disease control with the use of bevacizumab.5

Editors’ note: Pilocytic astrocytoma with anaplasia arising from the
optic chiasm in a very elderly patient
In reference to the NeuroImage “Pilocytic astrocytoma with anaplasia arising from the
optic chiasm in a very elderly patient,” Dr. Wasilewski comments that there are few studies
and no standard of care guidelines in the treatment of pilocytic astrocytoma in adults.
However, bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor,
has shown to be beneficial in case series. Author Hayashi reports on the course of their
patient in the NeuroImage, who received radiation and oral temozolomide. He agrees that
bevacizumab may be useful in patients with anaplastic pilocytic astrocytoma and micro-
vascular proliferation.

 Author response: Pilocytic astrocytoma with anaplasia arising from
the optic chiasm in a very elderly patient
Shintaro Hayashi (Sawatari, Japan)
Neurology® 2018;90:1038. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000005598
I thank Dr. Wasilewski for the valuable comments on our NeuroImage.1 Our patient received
irradiation (57.6 Gy/32 fractions) and oral temozolomide (100 mg for 5 d/mo for 14 months);
however, the tumor gradually extended to the hypothalamus and he was transferred to another
hospital for terminal care. We agree with Dr. Wasilewski’s comment that alternative regimens for
adult patients with anaplastic pilocytic astrocytoma (APA), especially showing recurrent or ag-
gressive nature, are to be explored and established, and antiangiogenic treatment is one of the
powerful tools. In our view, alternative treatments, such as bevacizumab, might be justified only
when patients with APA show microvascular proliferations, as observed in our patient.1 We are not
fully confident whether tests for BRAF V600E mutant proteins are mandatory, because the gene
mutations are found in 6%–8% of extracerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas,2 as well as in other
disorders (e.g., pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma or ganglioglioma).3

Reader response: ELAPSS score for prediction of risk of growth of
unruptured intracranial aneurysms
Joshua Z. Willey (New York)
Neurology® 2018;90:1038–1039. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000005595
In the article by Backes et al.,1 the primary outcome was defined as greater than 1 mm growth
as measured at local sites. The use of this cutoff was not referenced and a 1 mm change could
be subject to potential measurement error. Furthermore, if different imaging modalities in one
patient (magnetic resonance angiography vs CT angiography) were used to measure growth,
Editors’ note: ELAPSS score for prediction of risk of growth of
unruptured intracranial aneurysms
In “ELAPSS score for prediction of risk of growth of unruptured intracranial aneurysms,”
the authors established a 6-predictor risk score for aneurysm growth. In their study, they
defined significant aneurysm growth as greater than 1 mm. Dr. Willey discusses the
possibility of measurement error and bias as a result of this methodology. He also
questions whether the readers were blinded, how aneurysm ruptures were treated
statistically, and how ELAPSS compares to other existing classification systems. The
authors did not respond.

 their results could also lead to measurement error. An additional source of error and bias is if the
physician carrying out the measurement was aware of the prior size. In that instance, the inter-
preting physician may judge an aneurysm that is larger to be more likely to grow, thereby biasing
measurement. The potential sources of measurement error and bias may affect the results; it
would be helpful to know if there was a blinded central reading center.
In the analysis, it was also unclear how aneurysm rupture was treated statistically. It appears that
a stable aneurysm in 2 scans before rupture was treated as not having grown. Would this patient
be treated as censored in survival analysis and not contribute information on aneurysm growth?
Aneurysm rupture is a clinical outcome indicating a change in the aneurysm more serious than
a 1 mm growth and with similar risk factors. The estimates, which had a large standard error,
were heavily weighted toward size and location, which are well-known risk factors. To interpret
the clinical and additive utility of ELAPSS, a statistical comparison to a traditional score with
receiver operating characteristics or net reclassification would help. In other words, how
much better was patient risk stratified with ELAPSS compared to a simple classification (e.g.,
posterior circulation and size greater than 7 mm)?

Multiparametric MRI changes persist beyond recovery in concussed
adolescent hockey players
Neurology® 2017;90:1039. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000004909
In the data supplement for article “Multiparametric MRI changes persist beyond recovery in
concussed adolescent hockey players” by K.Y. Manning et al.,1 there is an error in the “MRI
Acquisition” section on page 4. The first sentence should read “All MRI data were acquired
using a 32-channel human head coil” rather than “64-channel coil” as originally published. The
authors regret the error.
