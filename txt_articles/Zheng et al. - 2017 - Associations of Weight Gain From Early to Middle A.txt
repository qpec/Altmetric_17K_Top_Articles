IMPORTANCE Data describing the effects of weight gain across adulthood on overall health
are important for weight control.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of weight gain from early to middle adulthood with
health outcomes later in life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort analysis of US women from the Nurses’Health
Study (1976-June 30, 2012) and US men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study
(1986-January 31, 2012) who recalled weight during early adulthood (at age of 18 years
in women; 21 years in men), and reported current weight during middle adulthood
(at age of 55 years).
EXPOSURES Weight change from early to middle adulthood (age of 18 or 21 years
to age of 55 years).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Beginning at the age of 55 years, participants were
followed up to the incident disease outcomes. Cardiovascular disease, cancer,
and death were confirmed by medical records or the National Death Index. A composite
healthy aging outcome was defined as being free of 11 chronic diseases and major cognitive or
physical impairment.
RESULTS A total of 92 837 women (97% white; mean [SD] weight gain: 12.6 kg [12.3 kg] over
37 years) and 25 303 men (97% white; mean [SD] weight gain: 9.7 kg [9.7 kg] over 34 years)
were included in the analysis. For type 2 diabetes, the adjusted incidence per 100 000
person-years was 207 among women who gained a moderate amount of weight (�2.5 kg to
<10 kg) vs 110 among women who maintained a stable weight (weight loss �2.5 kg or gain
<2.5 kg) (absolute rate difference [ARD] per 100 000 person-years, 98; 95% CI, 72 to 127)
and 258 vs 147, respectively, among men (ARD, 111; 95% CI, 58 to 179); hypertension: 3415 vs
2754 among women (ARD, 662; 95% CI, 545 to 782) and 2861 vs 2366 among men (ARD,
495; 95% CI, 281 to 726); cardiovascular disease: 309 vs 248 among women (ARD, 61; 95%
CI, 38 to 87) and 383 vs 340 among men (ARD, 43; 95% CI, −14 to 109); obesity-related
cancer: 452 vs 415 among women (ARD, 37; 95% CI, 4 to 73) and 208 vs 165 among men
(ARD, 42; 95% CI, 0.5 to 94). Among those who gained a moderate amount of weight, 3651
women (24%) and 2405 men (37%) achieved the composite healthy aging outcome. Among
those who maintained a stable weight, 1528 women (27%) and 989 men (39%) achieved the
composite healthy aging outcome. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for the composite
healthy aging outcome associated with moderate weight gain was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72 to
0.84) in women and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.97) in men. Higher amounts of weight gain were
associated with greater risks of major chronic diseases and lower likelihood of healthy aging.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In these cohorts of health professionals, weight gain during
adulthood was associated with significantly increased risk of major chronic diseases and
decreased odds of healthy aging. These findings may help counsel patients regarding the
risks of weight gain.

 O
besity is a major global health challenge. The world-
wide prevalence of obesity (body mass index [calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared; BMI] ≥30) was 11% for men and 15% for women
in 2014 compared with 5% for men and 8% for women in
1980.1,2Excessadiposityisawell-establishedriskfactorforma-
jor chronic diseases, including cardiometabolic disease, cer-
tain types of cancer such as postmenopausal breast cancer and
colorectum cancer, and overall premature mortality.3
Excess adiposity tends to accrue during early and middle
adulthood for most people. Among US adults, the mean weight
gain is 0.5 to 1.0 kg per year from early to middle adulthood4
andthismodestyearlyaccumulationofweighteventuallyleads
toobesityovertime.Adultweightgainhasbeenassociatedwith
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes,5 coronary heart disease
(CHD),5 hypertension,5 cholelithiasis,6 and several types of
cancer.7 However, most prior studies did not consider the total
amount of weight change across specific age ranges. It is un-
clearhowweightgainduringthetransitionfromearlytomiddle
adulthood, when most weight gain occurs,8 relates to subse-
quent health consequences. Recommendations for prevent-
ing weight gain during adulthood are lacking in public health
guidelines.9 Compared with studies of attained weight or BMI,
an investigation of weight change may better capture the ef-
fect of excess fat because it factors in individual differences
in frame size and lean mass that are difficult to measure in
population studies.
This study aimed to systematically examine the associa-
tion of weight gain from early to middle adulthood (age of 18
or 21 years to age of 55 years) with subsequent risk of major
health outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, car-
diovascular disease, cancer, cholelithiasis, severe osteoarthri-
tis, cataracts, a composite healthy aging outcome, and mor-
tality, in women and men from 2 large, ongoing cohort studies.
Methods
Study Design and Population
A cohort analysis was conducted using the Nurses’Health
Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study
(HPFS). The NHS began in 1976 with the enrollment of 121 701
female registered nurses aged 30 to 55 years, reflecting the ra-
cial composition of nurses at that time (97% white). The HPFS
began in 1986 with the enrollment of 51 529 male health pro-
fessionals (including dentists, optometrists, osteopaths, phar-
macists,podiatrists,andveterinarians)aged40to75years.Par-
ticipants in both cohorts completed an initial questionnaire on
medications, lifestyle, and medical history and were fol-
lowed up biennially via questionnaires that obtained up-
datedinformation.Follow-upinformationwasavailableforap-
proximately 90% of each study cohort. The details of both
studies were described.10,11
In the recruitment and biennial follow-up questionnaires
for both cohorts, participants reported their current weight.
The Pearson correlation coefficient between self-reported cur-
rent weight and the mean of 2 standardized technician-
measured weights was 0.97 for both women and men.12 In the
1982 questionnaire for the NHS and the 1986 questionnaire for
the HPFS, participants recalled their weight at 18 years of age
for women in the NHS and at 21 years of age for men in the
HPFS. In a subgroup of women aged 25 to 42 years in NHS II,
the mean difference between measured and recalled weight
at the age of 18 years was 1.4 kg, and the correlation was 0.87.13
Early- to middle-life weight change was defined as the change
in weight since early adulthood (ages of 18 years for women
and 21 years for men) to middle adulthood (age of 55 years).
The study was approved by the institutional review boards
of Brigham and Women’
s Hospital and Harvard T. H. Chan
School of Public Health, with informed consent indicated by
the return of the baseline questionnaire.
Outcomes and Covariates
Potential confounders included age, race, family history of dis-
eases, alcohol consumption and smoking status, physical ac-
tivity level, use of aspirin, menopausal status and postmeno-
pausalhormonetherapyuseforwomen,parityforwomen,and
a history of major chronic conditions reported via the regular
biennial questionnaires throughout follow-up. Race/ethnicity
was determined by self-selecting 1 of the fixed categories and
was considered as a covariate in the models because of the
knownrelevanceofrace/ethnicitytochronicdiseaserisk.Dietary
informationwasupdatedusingvalidatedsemiquantitativefood
frequency questionnaires14 in each cohort every 2 to 4 years.
Height was reported at the baseline questionnaire for each co-
hort.Self-reportedweightandheightwereusedtocalculateeach
participant’
s BMI.
The selected health outcomes included major age-related
conditionsthatcouldaffectthequantityandqualityoflaterlife.
Every2yearsafterbaselineofthestudy,participantswereasked
toreportnewlydevelopedhealthoutcomes,includingtype2dia-
betes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, sympto-
matic gallstones, cholecystectomy, hip replacement, severe os-
teoarthritis, and cataract extraction during the past 2 years.
Participants who self-reported a diagnosis of diabetes were

agnostic tests, and hypoglycemic therapy. The National Diabe-
tes Data Group criteria were used to define cases of type 2
Key Points
Question What is the association of weight gain from early to
middle adulthood with health outcomes later in life?
Findings During a follow-up of 18 years in 92 837 US women and
15 years in 25 303 US men, compared with participants who
maintained a stable weight (weight loss �2.5 kg or gain <2.5 kg),
those who gained a moderate amount of weight (�2.5-<10.0 kg)
had increased incidence of type 2 diabetes (absolute rate
difference/100 000 person-years of 98 in women and 111 in men),
cardiovascular disease (61 in women), obesity-related cancer (37 in
women and 42 in men), and mortality (51 among women who
never smoked).
Meaning Among women and men, moderate weight gain from
early to middle adulthood was associated with significantly
increased risk of major chronic diseases and mortality.

 diabetesbefore1998andtheAmericanDiabetesAssociationcri-
teria were used to define cases after 1998.
Self-reported hypertension,15 type 2 diabetes,16
cholelithiasis,17 severe hip osteoarthritis,18 and cataract
extraction19 were verified in subsamples with high confirma-
tion rates. Cholelithiasis was defined as a composite of unre-
moved symptomatic gallstones and cholecystectomy. Clini-
callysevereosteoarthritiswasdefinedastotalhipreplacement,
and simultaneously osteoarthritis (or other arthritis).18 Be-
cause cataracts are very common, cataract extraction was used
as a clinically significant end point to minimize misclassifica-
tion and to decrease variation in diagnosis. The diagnoses of
cardiovascular disease (a composite of CHD and stroke) and
cancer were confirmed by study physicians who reviewed
medical records. Obesity-related cancer included the esopha-
gus(adenocarcinomaonly),colonandrectum,pancreas,breast
(after menopause, women only), endometrium (women only),
ovaries (women only), prostate (only advanced and in men),
kidney, liver, and gallbladder.20 Incident cases of cardiovas-
cular disease, type 2 diabetes, overall cancer, and nontrau-
matic death were included in a composite measure of major
chronic diseases.21 Deaths during follow-up were reported by
next of kin, the postal system, and through the records of the
National Death Index. The underlying cause of death was as-
signed according to the eighth and ninth revisions of Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases.
The concept of a “composite healthy aging outcome”22 in-
cluded not only disease status but also cognitive and physical
functions. Following previous publications,23 the composite
healthy aging outcome was defined using the following 3 do-
mains: (1) no self-reported history of cancer, diabetes, CHD,
coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous trans-
luminal coronary angioplasty, congestive heart failure, stroke,
kidney failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis; (2) no cognitive decline (subjective cognitive de-
clinescore = 0by6relevantquestions);and(3)nophysicallimi-
tations(nolimitationsonmoderateactivities,andnomorethan
moderate limitations on more demanding physical perfor-
mancemeasuresofthe36-itemMedicalOutcomesStudyShort-
Form Health Survey). Because the cognitive assessments
mainly occurred in 2010-2012, participants who were alive in
2010 and had data regarding the 3 domains were included in
the analysis for the composite healthy aging outcome.
In the current analysis, the primary outcomes included in-
cidentcasesoftype2diabetes,hypertension,cardiovasculardis-
ease, obesity-related cancer, cholelithiasis, clinically severe os-
teoarthritis, cataract extraction, death, the composite healthy
aging outcome, and a composite measure of major chronic dis-
eases. The secondary outcomes included incident cases of car-
diovascular disease subtypes (ie, CHD and stroke), overall can-
cer, and mortality caused by cardiovascular disease or cancer.
A detailed description of ascertainment and documentation of
outcomes appears in the eMethods in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were
used to estimate incident rates and incident rate ratios (IRRs)
and 95% CIs as an indicator of relative risk of incident major
health outcomes (from the year when the participant turned
55 years old to 2012). The absolute rate difference (ARD) was
estimated by I × (IRR − 1) (I indicates the incidence among
the reference category or the study population). For the com-
posite healthy aging outcome, logistic regression models
were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs in 2010.
Because many outcomes were evaluated simultaneously
without adjustment for multiple comparisons, the analyses
from this study may be interpreted as exploratory in nature;
however, these analyses were based on a priori hypotheses
and previous literature.
Based on the examination of the distribution of weight
change in both cohorts, primary analyses of weight change
used the following categories: (1) weight loss greater than
2.5 kg, (2) weight loss between 0 and 2.5 kg or weight gain of
less than 2.5 kg (reference category), (3) weight gain between
2.5 and 9.9 kg, (4) weight gain between 10.0 and 19.9 kg, and
(5) weight gain of 20.0 kg or more. We chose 10 kg as the
cutoff point for moderate weight gain based on the estimated
median (10.9 kg in women and 8.8 kg in men) and mean
(12.6 kg in women and 9.7 kg in men) weight change of the
study participants. The cutoff for the extreme weight gain
group (20 kg) was based on selection of the highest 10% to
20% of both the female and male study participants. These
weight change cutoff points for categories were comparable
with those used in previous studies.24,25 For the analysis of a
composite measure of major chronic diseases, weight change
was further divided, yielding 9 categories (<−2.5 kg, −2.5 to
2.4 kg [reference category], 2.5 to 4.9 kg, 5.0 to 9.9 kg, 10.0 to
14.9 kg, 15.0 to 19.9 kg, 20.0 to 24.9 kg, 25.0 to 29.9 kg, and
≥30.0 kg). The analyses for trend of association across weight
change categories were conducted by assigning the median
value to each category and modeling this value as a continu-
ous variable.
Several secondary analyses were conducted. We also cat-
egorized the study population by quintile cutoffs of weight
change in each cohort, and compared the participants who
gained more weight (quintiles 2-5) with those who gained the
least (quintile 1). In addition, a possible nonlinear relation-
ship between weight change and incidence of disease was
tested nonparametrically with restricted cubic splines,26 and
tests for nonlinearity used the likelihood ratio test, compar-
ing the model with only the linear term vs the model with the
linear and cubic spline terms. The joint associations of weight
change and BMI at the age of 18 or 21 years, and that of BMI at
the age 18 or 21 years and at the age of 55 years, with inci-
dence of disease were also estimated.
Multivariable models of Poisson regression and logistic re-
gression were adjusted for age at cohort recruitment (continu-
ous), height (continuous), race (nonwhite or white), pack-
years of smoking (never smoker; past smoker with <5, 5-20,
or>20pack-years;orcurrentsmokerwith<5,5-20,or>20pack-
years), regular aspirin use (yes or no), status of menopause and
hormone therapy (women only: premenopausal, postmeno-
pausal and hormone therapy never use, postmenopausal and
current use, or postmenopausal and past use), parity (women
only: nulliparous, 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 children), physical activity

Alternative Healthy Eating Index21), family history, and weight
at early adulthood. All covariates were examined at the age of
55 years except for the age at cohort recruitment.
For missing data on physical activity and dietary quality,
data were imputed using median values; for missing data on
pack-years of smoking and alcohol consumption, partici-
pants were assigned to never smoker and nondrinker catego-
ries,respectively.Dummyvariableswereusedtoindicatemiss-
ing data for the other covariates. The mean missing data rate
for covariates was approximately 5%. Analyses were per-
formed for all participants combined and for subgroups
(eg, participants who never smoked). Potential effect modifi-
cation by smoking status (never vs ever) was evaluated by sig-
nificance tests of the cross-product interaction terms of smok-
ing status and weight change as a continuous variable using
the Wald test.
Based on the multivariable models, several sensitivity
analyses were conducted. For the type 2 diabetes analysis,
prevalent hypertension and hyperlipidemia and related medi-
cation use were further adjusted. For the analyses of cardio-
vascular disease and mortality, prevalent type 2 diabetes, hy-
pertension, and hyperlipidemia, and medication use for high
blood pressure and lipid levels were further adjusted. For
obesity-related cancer, history of lower gastrointestinal en-
doscopy, history of physical examination, mammography
(women only), and prostate-specific antigen test (men only)
were further adjusted. In additional sensitivity analyses, use
of antidepressants and oral steroids was further adjusted
among participants with available information.
Cohort-specific analyses were performed to generate
IRRs that were pooled together using meta-analysis. Fixed-
effects and random-effects models generated similar results.
Only results from the random-effects models are presented
given heterogeneity across the sexes. Heterogeneity was
assessed using the I2 statistic, where an I2 greater than 50%
indicated substantial heterogeneity.27 All statistical analyses
were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc)
and R version 3.2.2 (R Foundation). All P values were based
on 2-sided tests and were considered statistically significant
at P < .05.
Results
Baseline Characteristics and Weight Gain
A total of 92 837 women and 25 303 men were included in the
study. Participants were excluded if they died before the age
of 55 years; were older than the age of 55 years at cohort re-
cruitment;didnotreportweightatageof18years(forwomen),
age of 21 years (for men), or age of 55 years; or had an ex-
tremely low BMI (<17 for women and <18.5 for men) at the age
of 55 years (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). From early to middle
adulthood, participants gained a mean (SD) of 12.6 kg (12.3 kg)
during 37 years (median, 10.9 kg; interquartile range,
4.5-18.9 kg) among women and a mean (SD) of 9.7 kg (9.7 kg)
during34years(median,8.8kg;interquartilerange,3.6-14.8kg)
among men. Characteristics of the study participants across
categories of weight change appear in Table 1 for the NHS co-
hort and in Table 2 for the HPFS cohort. Consistently among
women and men, those who gained more weight were more
likely to be physically inactive, to be never smokers, to have
unhealthy dietary habits, and to have a higher prevalence of
chronic diseases at the age of 55 years.

 Relationships Between Weight Change and Incident Rate
of Health Outcomes
Separate analyses were conducted for each health outcome af-
ter further excluding those with specific prevalent disease at
baseline (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). During a mean
follow-up of 1 561 919 person-years among women and 343 951
person-years among men, there were 9419 incident cases of
type 2 diabetes; 39 585 cases of hypertension; 9399 cases
of cardiovascular disease; 9767 cases of obesity-related can-
cer; 9545 cases of cholelithiasis; 3090 cases of severe osteo-
arthritis requiring hip replacement; 41 600 cases of cataracts
leading to cataract extraction; and 32 422 deaths. A total of
10 919women(21%)and6041men(34%)wereclassifiedashav-
ing the composite healthy aging outcome in 2010 when the
mean age was 76.5 (SD, 7.2) years in women and 70.9 (SD, 4.8)
years in men.
In the multivariable models with adjustment for weight
at early adulthood and other covariates, weight change from
early to middle adulthood was associated with subsequent de-
velopment of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular
disease,cataracts,cholelithiasis,severeosteoarthritis,andmor-
tality (P < .001 for trend for all comparisons except for severe
osteoarthritisinmen,whichhadP = .003fortrend;Table3and
Table 4). Compared with participants who had maintained a
stable weight across early and middle life (reference group),
those who gained a moderate amount of weight (≥2.5 kg to
<10 kg) had higher incidence of type 2 diabetes in women (ARD
per 100 000 person-years, 98; IRR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.66-2.16])
and in men (ARD per 100 000 person-years, 111; IRR, 1.75 [95%
CI, 1.39-2.21]); hypertension in women (ARD per 100 000
person-years, 662; IRR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.20-1.28]) and in men
(ARD per 100 000 person-years, 495; IRR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.12-
1.31]); cardiovascular disease in women (ARD per 100 000
person-years, 61; IRR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.15-1.35]) and in men (ARD
per 100 000 person-years, 43; IRR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.96-1.32]).
There were similar results for CHD and stroke (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Moderate weight gain was associated with in-
creasedincidenceofobesity-relatedcancerinbothwomenand
men (Table 3 and Table 4); such associations were not signifi-
cant for overall cancer (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Moderate weight gain was associated with increased in-
cidence of cholelithiasis and severe osteoarthritis in women
only (Table 3). Moderate weight gain was not associated with
incidence of cataracts leading to cataract extraction in either
sex. Nevertheless, more than moderate weight gain was gen-
erally associated with increased incidence of these diseases in
both women and men. Moderate weight gain was associated
with increased mortality only in women who never smoked
(ARD per 100 000 person-years, 51; IRR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.01-
1.13]), whereas an extreme weight gain of more than 20 kg was
associated with 393 (in women who never smoked) and 345
(in men who never smoked) additional deaths per 100 000
person-years. Weight loss was not associated with higher mor-
tality in participants who never smoked (Table 3 and Table 4).
The association of weight change with mortality was more pro-
nounced among women who never smoked than that among
those who ever smoked (P < .001 for interaction), but not
among men. The magnitude of the association with cardio-
vascular mortality was larger than with cancer mortality, and
both associations were statistically significant (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). Further adjustment of prevalence of hyperten-
sion, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, the use of antihyper-
tensive and cholesterol-lowering medications, and cancer
screening (eTable 3 in the Supplement), or use of antidepres-
sants and oral steroids (eTable 4 in the Supplement) for se-
lected outcomes did not materially change the results.
A total of 3651 women (24%) and 2405 men (37%) who
gained a moderate amount of weight achieved the composite
healthy aging outcome, whereas 1528 women (27%) and 989
men (39%) who maintained a stable weight achieved the com-
positehealthyagingoutcome.Themultivariable-adjustedodds
ratio for the composite healthy aging outcome associated with
moderate weight gain was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72-0.84) in women
and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79-0.97) in men (Table 3 and Table 4).
The quintile analyses showed similar results for major
health outcomes (eTables 5 and 6 in the Supplement). The es-
timated increased incidence for participants with moderate
weight gain (quintile 2) and extreme weight gain (quintile 5)
compared with those who lost weight or maintained weight
(quintile 1) was comparable with that in main analyses for par-
ticipantswhogainedamoderateamountofweight(2.5-10.0kg)
and those who gained an extreme amount of weight (>20 kg)
compared with those who maintained a stable weight (weight
loss ≤2.5 kg or gain <2.5 kg).
A monotonic increase in the risk of a composite measure
of major chronic diseases was observed throughout the range
of weight gain categories, and this increased risk started to be
statistically significant with increasing weight gain beginning

cubic splines of weight change with selected individual health
outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
cancer, and mortality appear in eFigure 3 in the Supplement.
Theincreasedriskfordevelopingtype2diabeteswasmorepro-
nounced with higher levels of weight gain (eg, >10 kg) (P < .001
for nonlinearity).
In the joint analyses of early adulthood BMI and weight
change since early adulthood, the highest incident rate for
chronic diseases was observed in the group with the highest
BMI levels at early adulthood and the largest amount of weight
gain in both women and men (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
These associations were independent of each other for inci-
dentrateoftype2diabetesandcardiovasculardisease(P < .001
formaineffect),aswellasformortalityamongparticipantswho
never smoked (P < .001 for main effect). The joint association
of BMIs at young and middle adulthood was also examined
(eFigure 5 in the Supplement). Per unit increase of BMI at
middle adulthood compared with that at early adulthood was
associated with a higher incident rate of type 2 diabetes among
both women and men (P < .001 for interaction between BMIs
at young and middle adulthood).
Discussion
In 2 large, long-term cohorts, weight gain from early to middle
adulthood was associated with increased risk of morbidity and
mortality, and decreased odds of achieving the composite
healthy aging outcome among women and men, independent
of weight at early adulthood. Weight gain as little as 5 kg was
associated with significantly elevated incidence of a compos-
ite measure of major chronic diseases, consisting of type 2 dia-
betes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and nontraumatic death.
The adverse metabolic effects of excess adiposity are
knowntoincreasetheriskofcardiometabolicdisease.Thepro-
posed mechanisms include the development of dyslipidemia
and insulin resistance, enhanced secretion of proinflamma-
tory cytokines,5 and overactivation of the sympathetic ner-
vous system.28 Weight gain is associated with most meta-
bolic conditions.5 In the current study, the magnitude of
associated risk varied for specific disorders, and the stron-
gest direct association was seen for type 2 diabetes, followed
by cholelithiasis and hypertension.
The associations with adiposity may vary according to
characteristics of cancer; breast, endometrium, colon and
rectum, kidney, pancreas, esophagus, gallbladder, ovaries,
thyroid, and possibly prostate are classified as types of obesity-
related cancer.20 In the current study, most women were post-
menopausal and not receiving hormonal therapy, and a di-
rect association of adulthood weight change with cancer and
obesity-related cancer (in which breast cancer was the major
contribution) was observed in women (especially those who
never smoked). In men, the association with risk of cancer (in

smaller sample size. For colorectal cancer, the association with
early adulthood adiposity was particularly important, and a
substantial increase in risk was seen in men who were over-
weight during early adulthood and subsequently gained the
most weight (IRR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-8.3). This finding is consis-
tent with previous reports of weight trajectories29 and weight
gain30 on obesity-related cancer.

disability31 and cataracts are the principal cause of blindness
and visual impairment.32 The current study indicated that
weightgainfromearlytomiddleadulthoodwasassociatedwith
increased risk of severe hip osteoarthritis and clinically sig-
nificant cataracts leading to extraction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first cohort study on early- to middle-
life weight change and risk of clinically significant cataracts
leading to extraction.
In the current cohorts of women and men, adulthood
weight gain was associated with lower odds of the composite
healthy aging outcome later in life, defined by a full spectrum
of morbidity and functional outcomes. These findings con-
firm previous results from smaller studies of weight change
andadecreasedprobabilityofachievingthecompositehealthy
aging outcome,23 and those reporting adiposity was associ-
ated with individual components such as cognitive decline,33
physical limitations,34 and impaired health-related quality of
life.35 Such data provide strong evidence that maintaining a
healthy weight throughout early and middle adulthood is as-
sociated with overall health in those who survive to older ages.
Compared with the current study linking weight gain with
mortality, many previous studies have reported no effect of
weight gain on mortality,36 or linked weight loss to a higher
risk of death.37 Confounding by smoking and reverse causa-
tion (ie, weight loss due to chronic conditions) may have con-
tributed to those findings. By assessing weight change from
theagesof18or21yearstotheageof55years,thecurrentstudy
attempted to capture the changes in fat mass during adult-
hood before the major age-related loss of muscle mass starts,
and to minimize reverse causation due to ill health. In the cur-
rent study, the analyses were repeated among never smokers
only, in which the monotonic direct association of adulthood
weight change with the risk of death was strengthened in
women (P < .001 for interaction). Adulthood weight loss was
not related to a higher mortality rate. In addition, a higher BMI
at early adulthood and subsequent weight gain were indepen-
dently associated with increased mortality later in life.
This study has several strengths. The large sample size,
regular follow-up of study participants, and detailed re-
peated assessment of lifestyle factors provided high statisti-
cal power to examine various major health outcomes. The ad-
vantage of focusing on weight gain throughout adult life is
that it primarily reflects the accumulation of excess adiposity
from early to middle adulthood, which is often ignored by in-
dividuals and their physicians because the consequences of
modest weight accumulation may not yet be apparent. Both
the NHS and the HPFS have collected detailed, validated,13 and
repeated assessments of self-reported weight and lifestyle
factors, allowing careful control for potential confounding fac-
tors. Also, a subgroup analysis was conducted among partici-
pants who never smoked when analyzing cancer and mortal-
ity to avoid confounding by smoking status.
Thisstudyalsohasseverallimitations.First,weightatearly
adulthoodwasrecalledatalaterage.Althoughvalidationstud-
ies suggested good validity (correlation coefficients between
recalled and measured weight were 0.87 in women and 0.80
in men, and the difference in means were 1.4 kg in women and
1.3 kg in men),13,38 some misclassifications of weight change
were inevitable. Because the weight data were collected be-
forethestudyoutcomes,suchmisclassificationwaslikelynon-
differential and thus, the true associations might have been
underestimated. Furthermore, the magnitude of weight gain
fromearlytomiddleadulthoodobservedinourcohortsiscom-
parable with that in the general US population (eg, the weight
gains during the corresponding life course in women and men
in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey39
were both about 10 kg). Nevertheless, the potential for sys-
tematic error in the assessment of weight change needs to be
considered, especially considering that individuals tend to un-
derreport their weight. It is possible that our findings might
have exaggerated the true risks associated with the mea-
sured weight change from early to middle adulthood.
Second, the participants were all health professionals and
were mostly white. The homogeneity of health care access and
socioeconomic status helps to minimize confounding and en-
hances the internal validity, but the results might not be gen-
eralizable to all populations. Third, the risk of chronic dis-
eases and mortality was not assessed in relation to changes in
waist circumference, a marker of abdominal adiposity. Fourth,
given that multiple outcomes were analyzed in this study, a
chance finding could not be completely ruled out. Fifth, 2 of
the calculated I2 values for outcomes (93% for hypertension
and97%forthecompositehealthyagingoutcome)wereatvery
high levels, indicating that pooled analyses may have been sta-
tistically inappropriate and thus the results should be inter-
preted for men and women separately.
Conclusions
In these cohorts of health professionals, weight gain during
adulthood was associated with significantly increased risk of
major chronic diseases and decreased odds of healthy aging.
These findings may help counsel patients regarding the risks
of weight gain.
