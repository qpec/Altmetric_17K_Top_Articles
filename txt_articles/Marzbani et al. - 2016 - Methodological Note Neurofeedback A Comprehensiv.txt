1. Introduction
eurofeedback is not a new concept. It has 
been the subject of the study of research-
ers for several decades. Neurofeedback is a 
method that assists subjects to control their 
brain waves consciously. In fact, the electroencephalog-
raphy (EEG) is recorded during the neurofeedback treat-
ment. Then, its various components are extracted and fed 
to subjects using online feedback loop in the form of au-
dio, video or their combination. Accordingly, electrophysi-
ological components are separately demonstrated. As an

Neurofeedback is a kind of biofeedback, which teaches self-control of brain functions to subjects 
by measuring brain waves and providing a feedback signal. Neurofeedback usually provides 
the audio and or video feedback. Positive or negative feedback is produced for desirable or 
undesirable brain activities, respectively. In this review, we provided clinical and technical 
information about the following issues: (1) Various neurofeedback treatment protocols i.e. alpha, 
beta, alpha/theta, delta, gamma, and theta; (2) Different EEG electrode placements i.e. standard 
recording channels in the frontal, temporal, central, and occipital lobes; (3) Electrode montages 
(unipolar, bipolar); (4) Types of neurofeedback i.e. frequency, power, slow cortical potential, 
functional magnetic resonance imaging, and so on; (5) Clinical applications of neurofeedback 
i.e. treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, insomnia, 
drug addiction, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, dyslexia and dyscalculia, autistic spectrum 
disorders and so on as well as other applications such as pain management, and the improvement 
of musical and athletic performance; and (6) Neurofeedback softwares. To date, many studies 
have been conducted on the neurofeedback therapy and its effectiveness on the treatment of 
many diseases. Neurofeedback, like other treatments, has its own pros and cons. Although it 
is a non-invasive procedure, its validity has been questioned in terms of conclusive scientific 
evidence. For example, it is expensive, time-consuming and its benefits are not long-lasting. 
Also, it might take months to show the desired improvements. Nevertheless, neurofeedback is 
known as a complementary and alternative treatment of many brain dysfunctions. However, 
current research does not support conclusive results about its efficacy.

illustration, the power of a signal in a frequency band can 
be shown by a varying bar graph. During this procedure, 
the subject becomes aware of the changes occurring during 
training and will be able to assess his/her progress in order 
to achieve optimum performance. For instance, the subject 
tries to improve the brain patterns based on the changes 
that occur in the sound or movie. Neurofeedback treatment 
protocols mainly focus on the alpha, beta, delta, theta, and 
gamma treatment or a combination of them such as alpha/
theta ratio, beta/theta ratio, etc. (Dempster, 2012; Vernon, 
2005). However, the most commonly used protocols are 
alpha, beta, theta, and alpha/theta ratio. In this review pa-
per, we discussed various technical and clinical details of 
different neurofeedback treatment protocols.
2. Various Frequency Components
Activities of cerebral neurons have rich information about 
neuronal activities. When neurons are activated, they pro-
duce electrical pulses. By placing electrodes on the scalp, 
the electrical activity of the brain, known as EEG, can be 
recorded. In turn, EEG is generated by a specific type of 
synchronous activity of neurons which are known as py-
ramidal neurons and the electrical output is thus reflected 
in the following areas of the skin where the electrodes are 
located. Different patterns of electrical activity, known as 
brain waves, could be recognized by their amplitudes and 
frequencies. Frequency indicates how fast the waves oscil-
late which is measured by the number of waves per second 
(Hz), while amplitude represents the power of these waves 
measured by microvolt (µV). 
Different frequency components are categorized into 
delta (less than 4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), 
beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-100 Hz) where each rep-
resents a particular physiological function. In summary, 
delta waves are observed in the EEG signal when a per-
son is asleep, theta waves when a person is sleepy, alpha 
waves when a person is relaxed and his/her muscles are 
loose but he/she is awake, beta waves when a person is 
alert and gamma waves are observed when a person is try-
ing to solve a problem (Table 1). However, there are differ-
ences in defining the exact range of frequency components 
in different studies. 
These frequency components have subsets. For example, 
sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) frequency bands (13-15 Hz) 
are related to the sensorimotor rhythm and entitled as low 
beta. Some studies claimed that alpha rhythm has two sub-
sets: lower alpha in the range of 8-10 Hz and upper alpha 
in the range of 10-12 Hz. Whereas some studies indicate 
that the alpha rhythm has 3 subsets. These definitions indi-
cate that high and low alpha exhibit different behaviors and 
performances. It is believed that lower alpha is related to 
remembering action in semantic memory which is not the 
case for high alpha (Dempster, 2012).
3. EEG Electrode Placement
Electrodes (placed on the scalp) can record those corti-
cal activities of the brain regions that are close to them. 
Electrode System 10-20 is a method for standardizing 
areas of the skull and comparing data. The term “10-20” 
refers to the placement of electrodes over 10% or 20% of

the total distance between specified skull locations. Studies 
have shown that these placements correlate with the cor-
responding cerebral cortical regions. Of 21 electrodes, 19 
are used for recording cortical areas and 2 other electrodes 
as reference electrodes (Figure 1). The skull regions are 
named using letters and numbers. Letters correspond with 
the brain regions and numbers to the hemisphere of the 
brain or the locations of this hemisphere. The letters F, P, 
T, O, and C are related to frontal, parietal, temporal, occipi-
tal, and central areas, respectively. Odd/even numbers are 
associated with the left/right side of the brain region. The 
letter z is used as PZ suggests that scalp location falls along 
the central line running between the nasion and the inion. 
FP1 and FP2 are respectively related to the left and right poles 
of the forehead. Also A1 and A2 are the left right regions of 
vestibular (ear) region that are two common sites for the 
placement of reference and ground electrodes (Figure 1) 
(Dempster, 2012; Evans & Abarbanel, 1999). 
Traditionally, two types of unipolar and bipolar montage 
are used in the neurofeedback treatment. In unipolar mode, 
the active electrode is placed on the skull and the recorded 
signal by the active electrode is compared to the second 
electrode entitled as the reference electrode. The activity 
of the active electrode minus the activity of the reference 
electrode represents the brain activity at the active elec-
trode. 
On the other hand, in the bipolar mode, two active elec-
trodes are used that are separately placed on the skull. The 
difference between the recorded signals by these 2 elec-
trodes, is the basis of the neurofeedback (Demos, 2005; 
Dempster, 2012). One of the advantages of the bipolar re-
cording is the common mode rejection that occurs during 
the recording procedure. It means that any external artifact 
occurring at both channels and at the same time, its ampli-
tude and phase are subtracted and the spatial selectivity is 
improved. For example, eye roll and blink artifacts could 
be reduced in this way (Evans & Abarbanel, 1999). 
Neurologists have observed that lesions occurring in 
specific regions of the brain produce specific symptoms 
mostly related to these regions. For example, frontal lobes, 
FP1 , FP2 , FPZ , FZ , F3 , F4 , F7  are responsible for immedi-
ate and sustained attention, time management, social skills, 
emotions, empathy, working memory, executive planning, 
moral fiber or character. Each region represents a specific 
feeling or task; Thus identification of these areas provides 
the best and the most accurate neurofeedback treatment. 
Parietal lobes, PZ , P3 and P4, solve problems conceptual-
ized by the frontal lobes. Complex grammar, naming of 
the objects, sentence construction, and mathematical pro-
cessing are identifiable to the left parietal lobe while map 
orientation, spatial recognition, and knowing the difference 
between right and left are entirely functions of the right 
parietal lobe. Temporal lobes, T3 , T4 , T5 and T6 have various 
functions. Left hemisphere functions are associated with 
reading (word recognition), memory, learning and a posi-
tive mood, while right hemisphere functions are related to 
music, anxiety, facial recognition, and sense of direction. 
On the other hand, visual memories, accurate reading 
and traumatic memories accompanying visual flashbacks 
are usually processed in the occipital lobes, O2 , O1 and . 
The other functions of this lobe include helping to locate 
objects in the environment, seeing colors and recognizing 
drawings and correctly identifying objects, reading, writ-
ing, and spelling. Sensory and motor (sensorimotor) cor-
tex, CZ , C3 and C4 have functions of conscious control of 
all skeletal movements such as typing, playing musical in-
struments, handwriting, operation of complex machinery, 
speaking, and the ability to recognize where bodily sensa-
tions originate. 
Neurologists have mentioned that the motor cortex helps 
the cerebral cortex to encode both physical and cogni-
tive tasks. Therefore, subjects who have trouble seeing 
the logical sequence of cognitive tasks may benefit from 
neurofeedback training along the left hemisphere senso-
rimotor cortex (C3). Training along the right hemisphere 
sensorimotor cortex (C4) may invoke feelings, emotions, or 
calmness. Training at the median or  may facilitate a mixed 
response. The subjects who suffer from epilepsy are usu-
ally trained along the sensorimotor cortex (C3) to increase 
SMR. Also, training along the sensorimotor cortex could 
be applied for the treatment of stroke, epilepsy, paralysis, 
ADHD, and disorders of sensory/motor integration (Table 
2) (Demos, 2005).
 
Generally, electrodes are placed in a way that a particular 
EEG channel is located on one brain side (Bauer & Pllana, 
2014). For instance, low beta and beta are trained on the 
right (C4) and left (C3) brain side, respectively. If they were

switched to the opposite brain side, undesirable results 
could be obtained. For example, training low beta wave on 
the left side will result in a depletion of mental energy in-
stead of improvements in concentration. Thus, the location 
of the EEG electrodes during the neurofeedback procedure 
is important (Evans, 2007).
4. Types of Neurofeedback
 There are 7 types of Neurofeedback for the treatment of 
various disorders:
1) The most frequently used neurofeedback is frequency/
power neurofeedback. This technique typically includes 
the use of 2 to 4 surface electrodes, sometimes called “sur-
face neurofeedback”. It is used to change the amplitude or 
speed of specific brain waves in particular brain locations 
to treat ADHD, anxiety, and insomnia.
2) Slow cortical potential neurofeedback (SCP-NF) im-
proves the direction of slow cortical potentials to treat 
ADHD, epilepsy, and migraines (Christiansen, Reh, 
Schmidt, & Rief, 2014).
3) Low-energy neurofeedback system (LENS) delivers a 
weak electromagnetic signal to change the patient’s brain 
waves while they are motionless with their eyes closed 
(Zandi-Mehran, Firoozabadi, & Rostami, 2014). This 
type of neurofeedback has been used to treat traumatic 
brain injury, ADHD, insomnia, fibromyalgia, restless legs 
syndrome, anxiety, depression, and anger. 
4) Hemoencephalographic (HEG) neurofeedback pro-
vides feedback on cerebral blood flow to treat migraine 
(Dias, Van Deusen, Oda, & Bonfim, 2012). 
5) Live Z-score neurofeedback is used to treat insomnia. 
It introduces the continuous comparison of variables of 
brain electrical activity to a systematic database to provide 
continuous feedback (Collura, Guan, Tarrant, Bailey, & 
Starr, 2010). 
6) Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORE-
TA) involves the use of 19 electrodes to monitor phase, 
power, and coherence (Pascual-Marqui, Michel, & Lehm-
ann, 1994). This neurofeedback technique is used to treat 
addictions, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

7) Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the 
most recent type of neurofeedback to regulate brain activ-
ity based on the activity feedback from deep subcortical 
areas of the brain (Hurt, Arnold, & Lofthouse, 2014; 
Lévesque, Beauregard, & Mensour, 2006a).
5. Various Treatment Protocols
5.1. Alpha protocol
The alpha wave of the brain is usually associated with 
alert relaxation (Evans & Abarbanel, 1999). The alpha 
mood is described as a calm and pleasant situation. All 
alpha frequencies describe creative activity of the brain, 
so that it is used in the process of relaxation (relaxing the 
muscles), which eventually leads to sleep; Such waves 
emerge and expand rapidly on the skin. The evidence 
shows that alpha waves increases during meditation. 
Alpha training is usually used for the treatment of vari-
ous diseases such as pain relief (by 9 Hz simulation), re-
ducing stress and anxiety (by 10 and 30 Hz simulation), 
memory improvement, improving mental performance, 
and treatment of brain injuries (by 10.2 Hz simulation). 
Various studies have been performed on the alpha pro-
tocol (Table 3). The most common frequency bandwidth 
for the alpha treatment is 7-10 Hz frequency range, which 
is used for meditation, sleep, reducing stress and anxiety. 
Also frequency of 10 Hz causes deep muscle relaxation, 
pain reduction, regulating breathing rate, and decreasing 
heart rate (Dempster, 2012; Vernon, 2005).
5.2 Beta protocol
Beta activity is a good indicator for mental performance 
and inappropriate beta activity represents mental and 
physical disorders like depression, ADHD, and insomnia 
(Egner & Gruzelier, 2004). Beta brain waves are associ-
ated with conscious precision, strong focus, and ability 
to solve problems. Medications that are used to stimulate 
alertness and concentration such as Ritalin and Adderall 
also cause the brain to produce beta brainwaves. 
Beta training is used to improve focus and attention 
(simulation of increased beta 12-14 Hz), improve the 
reading ability (simulation of 7-9 Hz), and introduce 
positive changes in school performance. It also improves 
the computational performance, cognitive processing, 
reduction of worries, over-thinking, obsessive compul-
sive disorder (OCD), alcoholism, and insomnia (simula-
tion of 14-22 Hz and 12-15 Hz). Meanwhile, this type of 
neurofeedback improves sleep cognitive performance as

well as reducing fatigue and stress (simulation of light and 
sound of beta) (Table 4). The beta waves in the range of 
12-15 Hz (SMR) reduce anxiety, epilepsy, anger and stress 
(Egner & Gruzelier, 2004; Vernon, 2005). 
5.3. Alpha/theta protocol
Alpha/theta is an indicator between awareness and sleep. 
Alpha/theta training is one of the most popular neurofeed-
back trainings for stress reduction (Gruzelier, 2009; Ray-
mond, Varney, Parkinson, & Gruzelier, 2005). Also, this 
treatment is used for deep levels of depression, addiction, 
anxiety while it increases creativity, relaxation, musical 
performance, and promotes healing from trauma reactions. 
The electrodes are usually located on O1 , O2 , CZ and PZ . 
Alpha/theta frequency range is 7-8.5 Hz with the typical 
value of 7.8 Hz. This treatment is done under eyes-closed 
condition that increases the ratio of theta to alpha waves 
using auditory feedback (Demos, 2005; Egner & Gruze-
lier, 2003; Thompson & Thompson, 2003). The summary 
of the studies using alpha/theta protocol training are pre-
sented in Table 5.
5.4. Delta protocol
Delta waves are the slowest brain waves, which are as-
sociated with stages 3 and 4 of the sleep (Sürmeli & Er-
tem, 2007). They represent increased comfort, reduced 
pain, and sleep. Thus, they are used to alleviate headaches, 
traumatic brain injury, learning disorders, and to treatment 
hard and sharp contraction of muscles (by simulation of 
1-3 Hz delta wave). They also reduce concerns and im-
prove sleep (Vernon, 2005).
5.5. Gamma protocol
Gamma waves have the highest frequency, and they 
are associated with cognitive processing and memory 
(Staufenbiel, Brouwer, Keizer, & Van Wouwe, 2014). 
Thus, when these waves are faster, the speed of recalling 
memory is faster. Gamma waves are fast rhythms that are 
responsible for the brain’s neural connections and data 
transfer to the outside world. 
They are mainly observed in the hippocampus (an area 
of the brain which is responsible for converting short-term 
to long-term memory). Also, these rapid rhythms are ob-
served in sudden attacks like seizure and spasm. Hence, 
gamma training is used for promoting cognition, mental 
sharpness, brain activity, and problem-solving tasks. It 
not only improves poor calculation, but also organizes the 
brain, improves the speed of information processing, short-
term memory, and reduces the number of migraine attacks 
(Hughes, Vernon, 2005).
5.6. Theta protocol
Theta brain waves are related to a number of brain activi-
ties such as memory, emotion, creativity, sleep, meditation, 
and hypnosis. These waves are also associated with the 
first phase of sleep when the sleep is light and the person 
easily wakes up. Theta treatment reduces anxiety, depres-
sion, day dreaming, distractibility, emotional disorders, 
and ADHD (Beatty, Greenberg, Deibler, & O’Hanlon, 
1974; Vernon, 2005).
5.7. Low frequency versus high frequency training
Basically, there are two classical directions in neurofeed-
back training. It is either focusing on low frequencies (al-
pha or theta) to strengthen relaxation and focus (Gruzelier, 
2009) or emphasizing on high frequencies (low beta, beta, 
and theta) for reinforcing activation, organizing, and inhib-
iting distractibility (Ros et al., 2009). 
A suitable comparison between these two directions 
could be found at Thomas F. Collura (2000), and Kro-
potov (2010) studies. For example, in the former strategy 
eyes are closed while in the later one, eyes are open. Also,

6. Clinical Applications of Neurofeedback 
Training in the Treatment of Diseases and 
Disorders
Antisocial behavior of individuals, have an undesirable 
impact on the society. In recent years, with advances in 
brain science, the cause of abnormal brain function and 
mental illness has been attributed to the low activity of the 
anterior brain lobe that presents itself in different types of 
psychological damages (Gil, Li, & Lee, 2009). The neuro-
feedback training has been widely used in the treatment of 
many diseases and disorders; some of which are mentioned 
below. 
6.1. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
Evidence suggests that the malfunction of the right fron-
tal lobe, is the cause of attention deficit/hyperactivity disor-
der (ADHD) (Hynd et al., 1991). The resulting symptoms 
are inattention, distractibility, hyperactivity, and extreme 
dispassionateness. Neurofeedback therapy is a rehabilita-
tion approach for its treatment. Its goal is to normalize the 
behavior without dependence on medications or behav-
ioral therapy. For a long time, such drugs as Ritalin, Con-
certa, and Dexedrine have been used for treating ADHD. 
But, recent research showed that these drugs do not have 
any effect on the clinical treatment of ADHD on some of 
children. Also, these drugs have the side effects such as 
anxiety, irritability, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, in-
somnia, and headache. However, using neurofeedback is 
associated with their long-term improvement (Yan et al., 
2008). Studies showed that people with ADHD disorder 
have slower brain wave activity (theta) and less beta activ-
ity compared to normal people.
In ADHD, the goal is to decrease the brain activity in 
the theta band and to increase its activity in the beta band 
(or to decrease theta/beta ratio) at the vertex (electrode) 
(Heinrich, Gevensleben, & Strehl, 2007). This treatment 
is effective in reducing hyperactivity; Increasing focus, 
grades, and parental consent from children’s behavior; and 
improving indicators of sustained attention (Gnecchi, Her-
rera Garcia, & de Dios Ortiz Alvarado, 2007; Karimi, 
Haghshenas, & Rostami, 2011; Wang & Sourina, 2013). 
The studies on the neurofeedback treatment of ADHD 
in children are listed in Table 6. According to this Table, 
theta/beta protocol and the area for locating the EEG elec-
trode are the most commonly used neurofeedback strategy 
in ADHD treatment.
6.1.1. Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is known as the most unbearable mental 
illness (Surmeli, Ertem, Eralp, & Kos, 2012). People with 
schizophrenia have the illusion of auditory disorders, rest-
lessness, non-flexible muscles, confusion, delirium, and 
depression. Based on several papers on the treatment of 
schizophrenia, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inven-

tory (MMPI) and Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA), 
positive effect of neurofeedback training on the treatment 
of this disease is expressed in such a way that the person 
with schizophernia is able to adjust his/her brain activity 
on specific frequencies (McCarthy-Jones, 2012; Surmeli, 
Ertem, Eralp, & Kos, 2012; Wenya et al., 2012; Gil, Li, 
& Lee, 2009).
6.1.2. Insomnia
Insomnia is known as an epidemic disorder. The first 
change observed in patients, who are treated with neuro-
feedback training is the change and improvement in their 
sleep pattern. Hence, the neurofeedback training is used 
in the treatment of sleep disorders (Hammer, Colbert, 
Brown, & Ilioi, 2011). For example, the following pro-
cess is used to improve sleep. One electrode is placed on 
and the treatment is done for 30 minutes at a frequency of 
15-18 Hz. This method makes the waking state, alert and 
active and assist people in waking up faster. The calmness 
treatment is done at frequencies of 12-15 Hz and in loca-
tion. Using neurofeedback helps the people who normally 
take about an hour in order to prepare their body and mind 
for sleep, go to sleep faster.
6.1.3. Learning disabilities, dyslexia and dyscalculia
Neurofeedback has created a big change in the treatment 
of these disorders. These disorders are more common at 
school age and patients with dyslexia have trouble in read-
ing and spelling the characters (Breteler, Arns, Peters, 
Giepmans, & Verhoeven, 2010). People having dyscal-
culia, are unable to understand and solve math problems. 
These disorders are treated with increased alpha wave ac-
tivity using neurofeedback (Wang & Sourina, 2013). 
6.1.4. Drug addiction
Studies have shown that neurofeedback training is a good 
way to quit drug addiction whereas long-term use of the 
drug has a profound effect on the individual’s EEG. Temp-
tation and craving of drugs could be reduced by neurofeed-
back in patients addicted to cocaine (Horrell et al., 2010). 
This treatment can also be used to treat alcoholism and ad-
diction to computer games (Moradi et al., 2011).
6.1.5. Enhancing the performance of athletes, artists, 
and surgeons
Studies have shown that professional athletes have dif-
ferent patterns of brain activity compared to those of the 
beginners. Recognition of the status of the professional’s 
EEG before and during performance, provides a rationale 
for the use of neurofeedback training to create or emulate 
these patterns and to improve the performance of unprofes-
sional individuals (Vernon, 2005). In fact the purpose of 
neurofeedback on athletes is improving the athlete’s psy-
chomotor and self-regulation ability, their confidence, and 
subsequent performance in important competitions of the 
year (Edmonds & Tenenbaum, 2011).
6.1.6. Autistic spectrum disorder 
Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmen-
tal disorder with challenges that maintain in adulthood. 
Children with autism have difficulty in functions such 
as social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communica-
tion, behavior and interests. ASD may be associated with 
emotional problems, mental retardation, or seizure disor-
ders. These children may also have extreme sensitivity to 
sounds and smells. Also, children with autism may show 
idiosyncratic behaviors, obsessive rumination, poor social 
interrelatedness, and flat affect. Researchers found out that 
individuals with autism differ from normative samples 
with regard to impediments in empathy or theory of mind 
(TOM) tasks, weak central coherence, and executive func-
tioning.
One of the primary symptoms of ASD is a qualitative im-
pairment in social interactions related to mutual interest, 
understanding others’ intentions, empathy, emotional reci-
procity, and the underlying concepts of TOM. Empathizing 
deficits are consistent with problems in reciprocating com-
munication, difficulty in predicting thoughts and feelings 
of others, interpreting abstract emotions of others, and an 
appearance of social insensitivity. Individuals with autism 
are also often seen to have interest in system details and 
pursue careers in engineering, construction, clocks, ma-
chines, puzzles, or computers, which are often obsessive 
interests in ASD (Lucido, 2012). 
There are several diagnostic tools designed to show ab-
normalities in brain’s function for autism. They are (1) 
High-beta activity related to anxiety; (2) The high activity 
of delta/theta corresponding with the slow cortex, lack of 
attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity; and (3) Abnormal 
EEG/seizure activity. High beta type is the most common 
one seen among children with ASD (approximately 50-
60% of individuals with ASD) (Coben, Linden, & Myers, 
2010; Kouijzer, van Schie, de Moor, Gerrits, & Buite-
laar, 2010). The goal of neurofeedback in children with 
autism is to inhibit theta-alpha ratio while enhancing beta 
wave. Efficacy of neurofeedback in children diagnosed 
with autism has been well researched in qualitative case 
studies summarized in Table 7.

6.1.8. Epilepsy
In about one-third of patients with epilepsy, medical treat-
ment is ineffective. Neurofeedback training was shown to 
be a good alternative treatment for these patients. Research 
has been focused on increasing SMR (12-15 Hz) and syn-
chronous or asynchronous reduction of slow rhythms (4-7 
Hz) for diagnosing this disorder. Also, observing low-
amplitude gamma wave after surgery is a good sign for

the improvement of epilepsy. The results of studies on 
the treatment of epilepsy by neurofeedback indicated that 
continuous SMR treatment reduces the rate of seizures in 
severe and uncontrolled epilepsy (Table 8) (Hughes et al., 
2009; Walker, 2010).
6.1.9. Depression
Depression is associated with hypometabolism in the cin-
gulate and occasionally in the frontal cortex, insula, ante-
rior temporal cortices, amygdala, basal ganglia, and thala-
mus. Along with the frontal electrophysiology findings in 
depression, there seems to be an inverse relationship be-
tween frontal alpha asymmetry and parietal asymmetries. 
More specifically, depressed patients who do not have sig-
nificant anxiety, appear to have decreased right parietal ac-
tivation (alpha wave at P4). Neurofeedback training is used 
to increase alpha and theta, while inhibit faster beta fre-
quencies, produces significant improvements in depression 
(Budzynski, 2009a; Hurt, Arnold, & Lofthouse, 2014).
6.1.10. Anxiety
In clinical medicine, anxiety is often defined, at least in 
part, as high level of muscle tension. Researchers found 
out that decreasing frontal electromyogram (EMG) levels 
by EMG biofeedback could alleviate both generalized and 
specific anxiety patterns. It was believed that anxiety inhib-
its alpha waves, so alpha training would relieve the anxiety 
(Budzynski, 2009a; Demos, 2005; Moore, 2000).
6.1.11. Pain management
Pain is considered a symptom associated with physical 
damage, purportedly having an objective element connect-
ed with the sensation. Neurofeedback methodology pro-
poses that by teaching self-regulation, a patient can reduce 
or even eliminate pain sensations. Studies suggested that 
brain changes its functional organization at the level of the 
somatosensory cortex in chronic pain patients. Research-
ers recommend the use of biofeedback/neurofeedback for 
pain management. Biofeedback protocols are designed to 
address the peripheral correlation of arousal, such as tem-
perature, heart rate variability, and muscle tension while 
neurofeedback directly affects the processing of pain per-
ception (Ibric & Dragomirescu, 2009).
6.2. Other uses of neurofeedback
Other applications of neurofeedback include the recov-
ery from an injury and stroke problems, improvement of 
memory by increasing alpha activity (Escolano, Aguilar, 
& Minguez, 2011; Klimesch, 1999; Vernon, 2005; We-
nya et al., 2012), treatment of headache and migraines 
(Walker, 2011), distraction, confusion, attention problems, 
withdrawal (Escolano, Aguilar, & Minguez, 2011; Gnec-
chi, Herrera Garcia, & de Dios Ortiz Alvarado, 2007), 
health promotion (Escolano, Olivan, Lopez-del-Hoyo, 
Garcia-Campayo, & Minguez, 2012), treatment of men-
tal illness (Heinrich, Gevensleben, & Strehl, 2007), eat-
ing disorders (Bartholdy, Musiat, Campbell, & Schmidt, 
2013) Parkinson disease (Rossi-Izquierdo et al., 2013), fi-
bromyalgia, restless legs syndrome (Hurt, Arnold, & Loft-
house, 2014), obsessive compulsive disorder (Sürmeli & 
Ertem, 2011), and obsession (Markovska-Simoska, Pop-
Jordanova, & Georgiev, 2008; Surmeli & Ertem, 2011). 
Meanwhile, artists and surgeons use neurofeedback to im-
prove their music performance (Markovska-Simoska et 
al., 2008) and microsurgical operations (Ros et al., 2009), 
respectively. 
Alpha-EEG/EMG biofeedback is capable of increasing 
voluntary self-regulation and the quality of musical perfor-
mance (Budzynski, 2009b; Markovska-Simoska et al., 
2008).
7. Neurofeedback Softwares
Brain-computer interface systems (BCI) are widely used 
in clinical and research applications. BCI can propose a 
new aim for playing videogames or interacting with 3D 
virtual environments (VE). Interaction with VE includes 
tasks such as navigating to modify the selection and ma-
nipulation of virtual objects. 
There are several examples of VE feedback games used 
in sports, puzzles, or trainings. Nowadays, many universi-
ties and laboratories are trying to provide more interactions 
with the virtual world through the BCI. Here, we describe 
some of the BCI VE feedback software. 
Researchers at University College Dublin and Media 
Lab Europe manufactured Mind Balance videogame that 
uses BCI to interact with the virtual world. The game was 
designed to move an animated character in a 3D virtual 
environment. The purpose is to control the balance of an 
animated character on a thin rope, based on the EEG sig-
nals of a player. 
In the other computer game, designed jointly by the 
University College London and Graz University of Tech-
nology, a disabled person in a virtual street controls the 
movements of the simulated wheelchair (GRAZ-BC). 
These results indicated that a disabled person sitting in a 
wheelchair can control his/her movement in the VE using 
asynchronous BCI based on signal EEG.

University of Tokyo performed several tests using a “vir-
tual joystick” to navigate 3-D VE. Researchers provided 
two virtual buttons on the left and right sides of the VE. 
The participants were asked to gaze at either side to move 
the camera to the other side. The detection enabled the sys-
tem to identify the button at which the user gazed. 
Researchers at the University of Tokyo also worked on 
a system to keep the alertness level of car drivers. In this 
project, the driver’s state of concentration was illustrated 
when placed in a virtual driving environment. Accordingly, 
the BCI hearing system actively monitors the state of alert-
ness of drivers and warns them when loss of consciousness 
occurs. 
In the field of promotion of neurofeedback in VE, IN-
RIA designed several BCI systems. In one of them, called 
“use-the-force”, subjects were asked to control the launch 
of a virtual spaceship by using real or imagined foot 
movements. They studied the response of the subjects in 
challenging situations (Lecuyer et al., 2008).  In another 
system (Gnecchi, Herrera Garcia, & de Dios Ortiz Al-
varado, 2007), neurofeedback was examined in order to 
diagnose ADHD and hyperactivity disorder. In this system, 
there are two graphical interfaces. 
In the first interface, when the ratio of beta/theta goes 
higher than a predetermined threshold, dolphins are mov-
ing to an area where there are fish. Having maintained 
the focus, dolphin intercepts a fish. When the number of 
trapped fish increases, it reflects advances in process of 
treatment. In the second graphical interface, the speed of 
a racing car increases when subject’s attention improved. 
There are various available neurofeedback softwares in 
the market whose information such as operating systems, 
developers, and supported devices could be assessed via 
Wikipedia (“Comparison of neurofeedback software”, 
April 11, 2015).
8. Conclusion
In this paper, we reviewed the clinical applications of 
neurofeedback, various protocols of treatment and some of 
the systems designs by BCI and VR technology.
In neurofeedback, EEG is usually recorded, and various 
brain-activity components are extracted and feedbacked 
to subjects. During this procedure, subjects become aware 
of the changes that occur during training and are able to 
assess their progress in order to achieve optimal perfor-
mance. Electrode placement is performed according to 
specific brain functions and specific symptoms. Consider-
ing information about these skull regions, the entire treat-
ment process is simplified. There are several protocols in 
neurofeedback training, but alpha, beta, theta, and alpha/
theta protocol are the most commonly used ones. 
BCI is an EEG-based communication device. VE is a 
human-computer interface system with which users can 
virtually move their viewpoint freely in real time. The 
purpose of using VE is to construct a virtual environment 
with natural interactivity and to create a real sensation 
from multimodality. Three-dimensional VR is much more 
attractive and interesting than most of two-dimensional en-
vironments. 
To date, many studies have been conducted on the neuro-
feedback therapy and its effectiveness on the treatment of 
many diseases. However, there are some methodological 
limitations and clinical ambiguities. For example, consid-
ering the alpha treatment protocols, there are some issues 
to deal with such as how many sessions are needed before 
participants can learn to exert an alert control over their 
own alpha waves, or how many sessions are needed before 
such training procedures produce the expected effect on the 
optimal performance, and how long the desired effects last 
without feedback (long-term effects). Thus, it is necessary 
to provide standard protocols to perform neurofeedback.
Similar to other treatments, neurofeedback has its own 
pros and cons. Although it is a safe and non-invasive pro-
cedure that showed improvement in the treatment of many 
problems and disorders such as ADHD, anxiety, depres-
sion, epilepsy, ASD, insomnia, drug addiction, schizophre-
nia, learning disabilities, dyslexia and dyscalculia, its va-
lidity has been questioned in terms of conclusive scientific 
evidence of its effectiveness. Moreover, it is an expensive 
procedure which is not covered by many insurance com-
panies. It is also time-consuming and its benefits are not 
long-lasting. Finally, it might take several months to see 
the desired improvements (Mauro & Cermak, 2006).
