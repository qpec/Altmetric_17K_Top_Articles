 REVIEW
A review of the carbohydrate–insulin model of obesity
KD Hall
The carbohydrate–insulin model of obesity theorizes that diets high in carbohydrate are particularly fattening due to their
propensity to elevate insulin secretion. Insulin directs the partitioning of energy toward storage as fat in adipose tissue and away
from oxidation by metabolically active tissues and purportedly results in a perceived state of cellular internal starvation. In response,
hunger and appetite increases and metabolism is suppressed, thereby promoting the positive energy balance associated with the
development of obesity. Several logical consequences of this carbohydrate–insulin model of obesity were recently investigated in a
pair of carefully controlled inpatient feeding studies whose results failed to support key model predictions. Therefore, important
aspects of carbohydrate–insulin model have been experimentally falsified suggesting that the model is too simplistic. This review
describes the current state of the carbohydrate–insulin model and the implications of its recent experimental tests.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is defined as an excess accumulation of body fat, and
understanding obesity at the most basic level requires knowledge
of how adipose tissue fat storage and mobilization are regulated.
Insulin has a major role in modulating the activity of several
enzymes whose net effect is to promote the uptake, retention and
net storage of fat in adipose tissue.1 These basic facts of adipose
tissue physiology, along with the observation that dietary
carbohydrates are the primary driver of insulin secretion, have
led to the hypothesis that high carbohydrate diets are particularly
fattening.
In particular, the ‘carbohydrate–insulin model’ of obesity posits
that diets with a high proportion of carbohydrate elevate insulin
secretion and thereby suppress the release of fatty acids from
adipose tissue into the circulation and direct circulating fat toward
adipose storage and away from oxidation by metabolically active
tissues such as heart, muscle and liver.2–5 This altered fuel
availability is theorized to lead to a state of cellular ‘internal
starvation’ leading to adaptive decreases in energy expenditure
and increased hunger.2,5–7 Therefore, the positive energy balance
associated with development of obesity is purported to be a
consequence of the insulin-driven shift in fat partitioning toward
storage in adipocytes, which decreases energy expenditure and
increases food intake in an attempt to remediate the cellular
internal starvation of metabolically active tissues. Rather than
being a passive accumulator of fat as a result of overeating, the
carbohydrate–insulin model suggests that endocrine dysregula-
tion of adipose tissue is the primary driver of positive energy
balance.
The carbohydrate–insulin model provides a plausible explana-
tion of why insulin therapy tends to cause weight gain in people
with diabetes8 and why outpatient diet trials comparing low
carbohydrate diets to others tend to show greater short-term
weight loss despite low carbohydrate diets being unrestricted in
calories.9–11 Several popular books have promoted the carbohy-
drate–insulin model to the public as the reason why they have
gained excess weight in the past and why they should follow a
low carbohydrate, high fat diet for weight loss.12–14 However,
despite the apparent explanatory power of the carbohydrate–
insulin model, its scientific basis is questionable and recent studies
have challenged key predictions of the model.
SCIENTIFIC MODELS AND THE PRINCIPLE OF EXPERIMENTAL
FALSIFICATION
Scientific models seek to integrate a variety of data and explain a
set of observations about a system within an overarching
theoretical and mechanistic framework. Experimental confirma-
tion of a model’s predictions provides support for the validity of
the model and repeated confirmations may eventually lead to
widespread acceptance of the model as the scientific standard.
However, scientific models cannot be proven to be true. Rather,
models represent provisional representations of our understand-
ing, and countering evidence may require substantial model
corrections or possibly outright rejection of the model. Impor-
tantly, scientific models go beyond providing putative explana-
tions and make experimentally testable predictions that are
capable of falsifying the models.15
As model falsification is relatively rare in the field of nutrition,
I will use a well-known example from physics to illustrate the
process.16 In the late nineteenth century, physicists postulated
that light propagated as a wave through a medium called the
‘luminiferous ether’. Like the carbohydrate–insulin model, the
ether model seemed highly plausible as the wave-like nature of
light was well-known and all other waves propagated through a
medium. It was difficult to conceive how a wave could propagate
through a vacuum without a medium and scientists readily
accumulated evidence in favor of the ether model. (For example,
comet tails were thought to be caused by ‘ether drag’ as they
moved through the medium.) The ether model explained a lot and
it made sense. Unfortunately, it was also wrong.
As with all scientific models that attempt to explain certain
phenomena, the ether model made predictions that were

 experimentally testable. More specifically, experiments can be
designed that are capable of falsifying the model meaning that
failure of any necessary model prediction requires that the model
be abandoned as either too simple or simply incorrect. It does not
matter how many model predictions are successfully confirmed by
the experiment, failure of any single prediction means that the
model is falsified.
For the ether model of light propagation, falsification came with
the classic Michelson–Morley experiment in 1887 that failed to
detect a significant difference in the speed of light moving in
different directions through the hypothesized ether. Since then,
several
more
definitive
experiments
were
conducted
that
confirmed these results. The experimental falsifications of the
ether model did not imply that light does not have wave-like
properties, but the simple ether model of light propagation was
untenable.
EXPERIMENTAL FALSIFICATION OF THE CARBOHYDRATE–
INSULIN MODEL
Whereas some models of obesity are so complex that it is difficult
to know where to begin when assessing their validity,17 the
carbohydrate–insulin model provides clear experimentally testa-
ble predictions. For example, the carbohydrate–insulin model
predicts that diets with decreased proportion of carbohydrate to
fat, but identical protein and calories, will reduce insulin secretion,
increase fat mobilization from adipose tissue and elevate fat
oxidation. The altered metabolic and hormonal milieu associated
with reduced dietary carbohydrate will therefore relieve the state
of cellular internal starvation resulting in decreased hunger,
increased body fat loss and increased energy expenditure
compared with an isocaloric diet with higher carbohydrates and
higher insulin secretion.2 If any of these predictions fail, then the
carbohydrate–insulin model is falsified and a more commensurate
model must be sought.
Testing the model predictions requires inpatient feeding studies
as diet adherence cannot be guaranteed in outpatient studies.18
Recently, two metabolic ward studies directly tested the logical
consequences of the carbohydrate–insulin model in humans.19,20
Both studies were conducted while subjects were continuously
residing in metabolic wards where they consumed carefully
controlled diets. Both studies found the expected rapid and
sustained decrease in insulin secretion when dietary carbohy-
drates were restricted. Therefore, the experimental conditions
required to test the predictions of the carbohydrate–insulin model
were fully satisfied.
In concordance with the model predictions, carbohydrate
restriction led to increased fat oxidation reaching a maximum
within a few days and remaining constant thereafter. However,
neither study found the predicted augmentation of body fat loss
with carbohydrate restriction. Rather, despite the reduction in
insulin secretion, both studies found slightly less body fat loss
during the carbohydrate restricted diets compared with isocaloric
higher carbohydrate diets with identical protein.13,14
In one study, the reduced carbohydrate diet led to a significant
decrease in energy expenditure, both during sleep and through-
out the day, a result counter to the carbohydrate-insulin model.19
In the other study, a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet led to
increased daily energy expenditure of only 57 kcal/day, and the
effect waned over time.20 Although this small energy expenditure
increase during the ketogenic diet was in the direction predicted
by the carbohydrate–insulin model, it was quantitatively much
less than what was expected. Specifically, the effect size of the
pre-specified primary energy expenditure outcome was substan-
tially smaller than the 150 kcal/day threshold determined in
advance to be the smallest change that would be considered
physiologically important. Furthermore, the observed energy
expenditure effect was several-fold lower than the 400–600 kcal/
day effect previously estimated to be the ‘sizable metabolic
advantage’ of a very low carbohydrate diet21 and incompatible
with the popular claim of Dr Robert Atkins that such diets increase
energy expenditure to an extent that they offer a ‘high calorie way
to stay thin forever’.12
CONCORDANCE WITH PREVIOUS INPATIENT FEEDING STUDIES
Despite achieving the desired differences in insulin secretion via
isocaloric manipulation of dietary carbohydrate and fat, the recent
studies19,20 clearly demonstrated that the energy expenditure and
body fat predictions of the carbohydrate–insulin model failed
experimental interrogation. These results are in accord with
previous inpatient controlled feeding studies that have either
found
small
decreases
in
energy
expenditure
with
lower
carbohydrate diets22–25 or reported no statistically significant
differences26–35 when comparing diets with equal calories and
protein, but varying carbohydrates from 20 to 75% of total
calories. Furthermore, the small effects on body fat loss were
similar to those of previous inpatient feeding studies finding no
significant differences in body fat resulting from isocaloric
variations in carbohydrate and fat.30,36–39
There has never been an inpatient controlled feeding study
testing the effects of isocaloric diets with equal protein that has
reported significantly increased energy expenditure or greater loss
of body fat with lower carbohydrate diets. However, a recent
outpatient study reported that during a weight loss maintenance
period, the total energy expenditure was significantly increased by
325 kcal/day
during
a
28-day
very
low
carbohydrate
diet
compared
with
an
isocaloric
low
fat
diet
with
50%
less
protein.40 Although these results have been offered in support
of the carbohydrate–insulin model,2 such an interpretation is
confounded by the differences in dietary protein which is known
to be thermogenic.41,42 Furthermore, there are serious concerns
about diet adherence and the accuracy of the energy expenditure
measurements as these data were inconsistent with the lack of
significant changes in body weight or composition over the
3-month test period despite total energy expenditure being
~ 200–500 kcal/day greater than the reported energy intake.43
Another recent outpatient controlled feeding study examined
the effect of dietary carbohydrate and glycemic index on body
weight and composition during periods of sequential overfeeding,
underfeeding and refeeding with isocaloric diets containing equal
protein.44 Although there were no statistically significant differ-
ences in body fat changes between the diet groups, the highest
carbohydrate and glycemic index diet exhibited a trend toward
greater body fat regain during refeeding that amounted to an
increased rate of energy storage of ~ 400–500 kcal/day.
This pair of marginally supportive outpatient controlled feeding
studies40,44 suggests that perhaps the weight-reduced state is
required to unveil the effects of lower carbohydrate or reduced
glycemic index diets to improve energy expenditure and body fat.
This possibility deserves further investigation.
AD HOC MODIFICATIONS OF THE CARBOHYDRATE–INSULIN
MODEL
Although it is always possible to propose various ad hoc
modifications of a model to subvert apparent experimental
falsification, at some point a decision needs to be made to reject
the model and formulate an alternative that is more commen-
surate
with
the
data.
Ad
hoc
complexifications
of
the
luminiferous ether model were proposed, going so far as
suggesting that the length of measurement devices shrank in
the direction of motion through the ether—the so-called
Lorenz–Fitzgerald length contraction.16 Shrinking the experi-
mental apparatus by just the right tiny amount could save the
ether model, but this proposal seemed highly contrived. In 1905,

 Einstein explained the Lorentz–Fitzgerald contraction as being a
natural consequence of his special theory of relativity that did
not require a medium for light propagation. The ether model
was finally dead and buried.
Ad hoc modifications of the carbohydrate–insulin model
include the possibility that the downstream effects of reduced
insulin secretion take more time to come to fruition, and the
experiments were not long enough to observe these effects. For
example, perhaps fat oxidation further increases over more
prolonged periods of carbohydrate restriction, thereby leading
to an acceleration of body fat loss. However, daily fat oxidation
was observed to plateau within the first week of the reduced
carbohydrate diets as indicated by the rapid and sustained drop in
daily respiratory quotient.19,20 As further evidence that adapta-
tions to carbohydrate restriction occur relatively quickly, adipose
lipolysis is known to reach a maximum within the first week of a
prolonged fast45 as does hepatic ketone production.46 Although
there is some evidence that exercise performance may increase
over several weeks of adaptation to a low carbohydrate diet,47
there is no evidence for acceleration of daily fat oxidation.
Another ad hoc modification of the carbohydrate–insulin model
of obesity suggests that it only applies to certain people, perhaps
those who are sufficiently intolerant to dietary carbohydrates.
In that case, our recent experiments19,20 and all previous inpatient
studies22–28,30–39 failed to confirm the model predictions because
they were performed in the wrong subjects. Although this
possibility cannot be excluded, it severely limits the general-
izability of the carbohydrate–insulin model to an extent that it is
highly unlikely to explain the general features of common obesity
and its increasing prevalence.
Perhaps the predicted increase in energy expenditure with
carbohydrate restriction occurs not through changes in metabolic
rate, but rather via increased spontaneous physical activity.
Therefore, such effects may not have been observed while
subjects resided as inpatients on metabolic wards that limited
their physical activities. Some support for this possibility was
provided in the recent study that found a statistically nonsigni-
ficant 126 kcal/day increase in spontaneous physical activity
energy expenditure on the days spent outside the metabolic
chamber at the end of the 2-month inpatient stay when the
subjects were consuming the ketogenic diet.20 However, this
trend for increased physical activity expenditure could also be
interpreted as the result of the subjects’ behavior being affected
by the time spent on the metabolic wards rather than an effect of
the ketogenic diet. Nevertheless, a modest effect of carbohydrate
restriction on spontaneous physical activity is certainly plausible
and might be amplified under free-living conditions.
Finally, it may be that the carbohydrate–insulin model operates
primarily by affecting energy intake such that low carbohydrate
diets decrease hunger, reduce appetite and promote satiety
without offering any particular metabolic advantage for body fat
loss. This aspect of the carbohydrate–insulin model was not
directly examined in the recent studies as food intake was strictly
controlled.19,20 Under ad libitum feeding conditions, the possible
effect of decreased carbohydrates and insulin per se may be
difficult to dissociate from the effects of increased dietary protein
that often accompanies carbohydrate restriction which
may
independently promote satiety, decrease overall energy intake, as
well as increase energy expenditure, and beneficially influence
energy partitioning and body composition.41,42 Nevertheless, very
low carbohydrate diets with limited protein likely reduce appetite
by promoting an increase in circulating ketones,48 although the
mechanism for this effect is unclear.49
IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
It is important to emphasize that low carbohydrate diets may offer
metabolic benefits beyond loss of weight and body fat50
regardless of whether the carbohydrate–insulin model is true or
false. Furthermore, experimental falsification of important aspects
of the carbohydrate–insulin model does not mean that dietary
carbohydrates and insulin are unimportant for body fat regulation.
Rather, their role is more complicated than the carbohydrate–
insulin model suggests as differences in energy expenditure and
body fat have been observed to occur in diametrically opposite
directions than were predicted on the basis of differences in
carbohydrate intake and insulin secretion.19,20
The rise in obesity prevalence may be primarily due to
increased consumption of refined carbohydrates, but the mechan-
isms are likely to be quite different from those proposed by the
carbohydrate–insulin model. For example, such diets may lead to
greater overall energy intake by increasing palatability, increasing
appetite or decreasing satiety.
Reasonable ad hoc modifications of the carbohydrate–insulin
model have been proposed, but the revised model relies on
hypothesized effects of carbohydrates and insulin to alter energy
intake and spontaneous physical activity, both of which remain to
be demonstrated experimentally.
An intriguing possibility is that several predictions of the
carbohydrate–insulin model may come to fruition during main-
tenance of lost weight or weight regain as suggested by recent
outpatient studies.40,44 If so, this implies that reduced carbohy-
drate diets may be beneficial for prevention of weight regain
following weight loss.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
I have received funding from the Nutrition Science Initiative to investigate the effects
of ketogenic diets on human energy expenditure. I also have a patent pending on a
method of personalized dynamic feedback control of body weight (US Patent
Application No 13/754 058; assigned to the National Institutes of Health).
