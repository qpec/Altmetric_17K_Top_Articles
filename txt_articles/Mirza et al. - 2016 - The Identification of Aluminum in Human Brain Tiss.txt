Abstract. Aluminum in human brain tissue is implicated in the etiologies of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s
disease. While methods for the accurate and precise measurement of aluminum in human brain tissue are widely acknowl-
edged, the same cannot be said for the visualization of aluminum. Herein we have used transversely-heated graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectrometry to measure aluminum in the brain of a donor with Alzheimer’s disease, and we have devel-
oped and validated fluorescence microscopy and the fluor lumogallion to show the presence of aluminum in the same tissue.
Aluminum is observed as characteristic orange fluorescence that is neither reproduced by other metals nor explained by
autofluorescence. This new and relatively simple method to visualize aluminum in human brain tissue should enable more
rigorous testing of the aluminum hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease (and other neurological conditions) in the future.

INTRODUCTION
Quantitative and semi-quantitative methods have
confirmed the presence of aluminum in human brain
tissue [1]. Recent research has highlighted some of
the difficulties in obtaining reliable and reproducible
quantitative data for brain aluminum content and
specifically in relation to its heterogeneous distri-
bution or tendency to be found in focal or discrete
deposits [2, 3]. It is of critical importance that we
are able to make accurate measurements of the alu-
minum content of human brain tissue as aluminum is
implicated in the etiologies of a number of neurode-
generative diseases and especially in Alzheimer’s

disease [4] where it may contribute toward disease
onset and progression [5]. While significant progress
has been made in measuring the aluminum content
of brain tissue, there have not been similar advances
in the ability to visualize aluminum in human brain
tissue sections postmortem. The spectroscopically

ing techniques now routinely used to identify other
metal ions in human brain tissue. However, there is
a clear need for a relatively simple and non-invasive
microscopy-based method to image aluminum and
thereby complement and add credence to quantita-
tive measurements. Herein we have optimized the
fluor, lumogallion, for the identification of aluminum
in human brain tissue using fluorescence microscopy.

to measure aluminum in seawater with a limit of
detection of ca 2 nM [6]. Upon binding Al3+ and
excitation at ca 500 nm, the 1 : 1 complex emits
aluminum-specific fluorescence at ca 590 nm and
these properties have already been adapted for
the identification of aluminum in plant tissues [7]
and recently to show the intracellular presence of
aluminum in immune-reactive cells [8]. We have
measured the aluminum content of brain tissue
donated by an individual with Alzheimer’s disease
and complemented these data with the unequivocal
visual identification of aluminum using fluorescence
microscopy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The donor was a 69-year-old man, originally from
the town of Camelford, Cornwall, and known to have
beenexposedtoaluminumduringthis,now,infamous
event when 20 tons of aluminum sulphate were inad-
vertently added to the potable water supply [9]. In
2005, aged 60, the donor was admitted to a nursing
home with suspected Alzheimer’s disease. He died
in 2014, at which point the left half of the brain was
fixed in formalin and retained for neuropathological
examination, while the right half of the brain had
been sliced and frozen for the MRC London Neu-
rodegenerative Diseases Brain Bank. The fixed left
half of the brain weighed 463 g and the left half brain
stem and cerebellum weighed 81 g. External exam-
ination revealed cerebral atrophy and coronal slices
of the cerebral hemisphere confirmed atrophy with a
small hippocampus. The histology showed extensive
and widespread tau pathology in the form of neuritic
plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil threads
in addition to amyloid-� deposition in the form of
plaques and moderate amyloid angiopathy. This met
the criteria for Brain Net Europe (BNE)/modified
Braak stage VI of Alzheimer’s disease [10], and
reached the score A-3, B-3, C-3 (high Alzheimer’s
disease neuropathological change) according to the
National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer’s Association
guidelines [11]. There was also some cortical Lewy
body and TDP-43 pathology noted.
There was ethical approval from The MRC London
Neurodegenerative Diseases Brain Bank at King’s
College, London (08/MRE09/38 + 5).
Frozen tissue samples, 5–10 g, were transported
on dry ice to Keele University and stored frozen.
The aluminum content of these tissues was measured
by an established and fully validated method, which
herein is described briefly. Thawed tissues were
cut using a stainless steel blade to give individual
samples of ca 0.5 g wet weight and dried to a con-
stant weight at 37°C. Dried and weighed tissues
were digested in a microwave (MARS Xpress CEM
Microwave Technology Ltd.) in a mixture of 1 mL
15.8 M HNO3 (Fisher Analytical Grade) and 1 mL
30% w/v H2O2 (BDH Aristar). Digests were clear
with no fatty residues and, upon cooling, were made
up to 5 mL volume using ultrapure water (cond.
<0.067 �S/cm). Total aluminum was measured in
each sample by transversely-heated graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectrometry (TH GFAAS) using
matrix-matched standards and an established analyt-
ical program [2].
A 1 mM lumogallion (Tokyo Chemical Industry,
UK) solution was prepared in 50 mM PIPES (Sigma-
Aldrich, UK), buffered to pH 7.40 ± 0.05 and stored
in the dark when not in use. A 50 mM PIPES rinse
solution buffered to pH 7.40 ± 0.05 was also pre-
pared. An ethanol gradient series (100, 95, 90, 70,
50, and 30%) was prepared using ultrapure water and
absolute ethanol. The clearing agent, Histo-ClearTM
(National Diagnostics, UK), was used as purchased.
Superfrost®Plus slides (Thermo Scientific, UK) were
used to adhere brain tissue sections. Slides were
cleaned using lens tissue (Polysciences Inc., UK).
Fluoromount™ (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) was used as
an aqueous mounting medium and was stored in
the dark when not in use. Formalin-fixed brain tis-
sue was supplied as pre-embedded paraffin blocks
representingfrontal,parietal,andtemporalandoccip-
ital lobes. Hippocampal sections were not available.
Prior to microtomy blocks were cooled in ice for
3 h before 5 �m sections were cut at a clearance
angle of 5°. Sections were floated onto a 50°C water
bath for approximately 30 s before being mounted
on microscope slides and thereafter being placed on
a hotplate at 30°C for 2 h. Slides were then stored at
room temperature overnight to ensure they were fully
dried out. Slides were dewaxed using Histo-ClearTM
and run through the aforementioned ethanol gradient
from 100 to 30% before being immersed for 30 s in
ultrapure water to remove all residual alcohol. Serial
adjacent sections were then incubated in either 1 mM
lumogallion in 50 mM PIPES at pH 7.40 ± 0.05 or
simply 50 mM PIPES at pH 7.40 ± 0.05 for 45 min,
the latter being used to determine the contribution
from autofluorescence. Incubated slides from either
treatment were rinsed 6 times in 50 mM PIPES
at pH 7.40 ± 0.05, placed in a dish of ultrapure
water for 30 s before coverslips were secured using

2 drops of Fluoromount™ mounting medium. All
of the aforementioned procedures, from sectioning
to mounting, are the final outcomes of significant
optimization to give the very best reproducible mate-
rials for subsequent fluorescence microscopy. Slides
were imaged using an Olympus BX50 fluorescence
microscope with a BX-FLA reflected light fluores-
cence attachment, equipped with a mercury burner
and a vertical illuminator. For lumogallion (and au-
tofluorescence) imaging, a U-MNIB3 fluorescence
filter cube was used (bandpass excitation filter:
470–495 nm, dichromatic mirror: 505 nm, longpass
emission filter: 510 nm) (both from Olympus, UK).
Images were obtained using CellD software (Olym-
pus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH).
Agarose gels were prepared as surrogates for
human tissues. Agarose (National Diagnostics, USA)
at 2% w/v was dissolved in either ultra-pure water
(<0.067 �S/cm) or 10 mM certified (PE Life Sci-
ences) metal stocks (Al, Cu, Fe, Zn, Ca, Mg) in
ultra-pure water, adjusted to pH 5.0, by heating to
95°C for up to 30 min. Blocks of metal-impregnated
agarose were prepared by pouring hot solution into
molds and leaving to solidify at 4°C. Square sections,
0.5 cm by 0.5 cm, of agarose block were cut by hand
and then processed for lumogallion staining as per
brain tissues described above.
RESULTS
Aluminum content of brain tissue
The mean aluminum content in each brain region
varied from 0.45 (0.84) �g/g dry wt. in the
hippocampus to 1.75 (1.43) �g/g dry wt. in the occip-
ital lobe (Table 1). The concentration of aluminum
in tissue replicates ranged from the limit of detec-
tion, 0.01 �g/g dry wt. to 5.58 �g/g dry wt. with
the temporal lobe showing 1/9 values considered as
pathologically significant; the hippocampus showing
1/10 values considered as pathologically concern-
ing; the occipital lobe showing 9/21 values as either
pathologically concerning or significant; the frontal
lobe showing 1/21 values as pathologically signi-
ficant and the parietal lobe showing 5/21 values as
either pathologically concerning or significant.

(Figs. 2–4). There was no aluminum-related autofluo-
rescence in adjacent serial sections and this helped to
confirm the positive and unequivocal identification
of aluminum in each of the sections Figs. 2A–C,
3A–C, 4A, C. Yellow ‘fluorescence’ in all sections
is suggested to be lipofuscin and is similarly iden-
tified under autofluorescence in all sections. Bright
green fluorescence in lumogallion-stained tissues
with the appearance of lipofuscin may be indicative
of the co-localization of aluminum and lipofuscin
(Fig. 3E). Aluminum was easily identified throughout
the occipital lobe and appeared primarily as diffuse,
almost certainly, extracellular deposits (Figs. 2 and
3). Easily identifiable aluminum fluorescence cov-
ered areas of tissue up to a diameter of 20 �m or more
and these upon closer inspection appeared to include
distinct punctate deposits of aluminum not dissimi-
lar in structure to those making up yellow lipofuscin
granules. Sub-micron particles exhibiting orange flu-
orescence suggest the possibility of intraneuronal
aluminum though such must remain equivocal for
now. Aluminum fluorescence was identifiable in grey
matter of temporal lobe (Fig. 4) though the num-
bers of deposits were fewer and further between and
generally they were also smaller in size.
DISCUSSION
Aluminum was identified quantitatively by TH
GFAAS (Table 1) and qualitatively by fluores-
cence microscopy (Figs. 2–4) in brain tissue from a
donor diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The latter

represents the first unequivocal identification of alu-
minum in human brain tissue using fluorescence
microscopy. Aluminum was found in concentrations
deemed to be pathologically-significant in each of
the four main lobes and pathologically-concerning in
the hippocampus. Aluminum content was especially
high in occipital and parietal lobes and was coin-
cident with significant Alzheimer’s disease-related
neuropathology. This detailed neuropathology will
be described in a companion paper. We confirmed
the measurements of aluminum using TH GFAAS
by using fluorescence microscopy to show unequivo-
cally the presence of aluminum in human brain tissue.
We developed the aluminum-selective fluor lumo-
gallion specifically for this purpose and confirmed
the identification of aluminum by proving that the
observed fluorescence could neither by explained by
another metal (Fig. 1) nor autofluorescence. The abi-
lity to measure aluminum in human brain tissue with
accuracy and precision is now widely accepted while
a relatively simple method to visualize aluminum in
human brain tissue has hitherto been elusive. The
method developed in this research should be imme-
diately accessible to most laboratories and combined
with other microscopy techniques should allow the
detailed investigation of not only the presence of alu-
minum but its locations and potentially, associations,
in human brain tissue.
