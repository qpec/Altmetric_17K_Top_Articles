Local recurrence is a common cause of treatment failure for patients with solid tumors. Intraoperative detection
of microscopic residual cancer in the tumor bed could be used to decrease the risk of a positive surgical margin,
reduce rates of reexcision, and tailor adjuvant therapy. We used a protease-activated fluorescent imaging probe,
LUM015, to detect cancer in vivo in a mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and ex vivo in a first-in-human
phase 1 clinical trial. In mice, intravenous injection of LUM015 labeled tumor cells, and residual fluorescence
within the tumor bed predicted local recurrence. In 15 patients with STS or breast cancer, intravenous injection
of LUM015 before surgery was well tolerated. Imaging of resected human tissues showed that fluorescence from
tumor was significantly higher than fluorescence from normal tissues. LUM015 biodistribution, pharmacokinetic
profiles, and metabolism were similar in mouse and human subjects. Tissue concentrations of LUM015 and its
metabolites, including fluorescently labeled lysine, demonstrated that LUM015 is selectively distributed to tu-
mors where it is activated by proteases. Experiments in mice with a constitutively active PEGylated fluorescent
imaging probe support a model where tumor-selective probe distribution is a determinant of increased fluores-
cence in cancer. These co-clinical studies suggest that the tumor specificity of protease-activated imaging probes,
such as LUM015, is dependent on both biodistribution and enzyme activity. Our first-in-human data support future
clinical trials of LUM015 and other protease-sensitive probes.
INTRODUCTION
Surgical resection is the primary treatment modality for most solid tu-
mors diagnosed before metastatic spread. In patients with soft tissue sar-
coma (STS) of the extremity and breast cancer, organ-sparing surgery
alone prevents local recurrence in about two-thirds of patients (1–3). Lo-
cal recurrence is due to residual cancer in the tumor bed, the risk of
which is inferred by histopathological evaluation for the presence of tu-
mor cells on the surface of the excised margin (1, 4). Intraoperative fro-
zen margin assessment is limited by time and prone to sampling error,
leading to false-negative results in up to 23% of cases (5). An intra-
operative technique to accurately identify microscopic residual disease
within the tumor bed could be used to decrease the risk of a positive sur-
gical margin, reduce the rate of re-resection, and tailor adjuvant therapy.
Emerging approaches to detect microscopic residual disease within
the tumor bed include spectroscopy and optical imaging. Raman spec-
troscopy measures the scattering properties of tissues, and tumor-
targeted Raman reporters like gold nanostars can provide excellent
tumor-to-normal tissue contrast (6, 7). Fluorescence optical imaging
resolves molecular features, and nonspecific fluorescent imaging probes
such as methylene blue and indocyanine green provide contrast be-
tween tumor and normal tissues and are currently in clinical trials.
The mean tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) with these imaging agents
ranges from 1.2 to 8.5 in mouse and human studies (8–10). To increase
the TBR, targeted (11–13) and activatable fluorescent probes have
also been developed. Activatable probes are optically silent until cleaved
by proteases that are overexpressed by tumors, such as cathepsin
proteases (14–16). In a previous study, we used the LSL-KrasG12D/+;
p53flox/flox (KP) and Braf Ca/+; p53flox/flox (BP) mouse models of STS
and a wide field-of-view imaging system to detect cathepsin-activated
fluorescence in tumor cells (17). Residual fluorescence in the tumor bed
correlated with local recurrence, and image-guided surgery improved
outcomes for mice. This intraoperative imaging system has also been
used in canine patients with spontaneous tumors (18).
Although protease-activated probes have shown promise preclini-
cally, translation has been hindered by suboptimal preclinical models
and limited funding for probe synthesis, toxicity studies, and phase
1 clinical trials. We were able to overcome these hurdles, among others,
to translate protease-activated probes into the operating room. Here, we

 specifically explored the use of LUM015, a
novel PEGylated protease-activated far-red
fluorescent imaging probe. Preclinical tox-
icity studies of LUM015 were performed
in rats and indicated a wide margin of
safety. We report here a first-in-human
phase 1 trial of LUM015 to test the safety
of the probe in patients undergoing sur-
gery for STS and breast cancer as well as
LUM015 pharmacokinetics. Co-clinical
studies in mice were conducted to optimize
the dose and timing of LUM015 adminis-
tration and to investigate the in vivo mech-
anisms of tumor specificity. Our studies
support further clinical development of
LUM015 in clinical trials with intraopera-
tive imaging of the tumor bed.
RESULTS
LUM015 forms two different
optically active metabolites
LUM015 consists of a commercially availa-
ble fluorescence quencher molecule (QSY21)
attached through a GGRK peptide to a
20-kD polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a Cy5
fluorophore (Fig. 1A). LUM015 is optical-
ly inactive, but upon proteolytic cleavage
by cathepsins K, L, and S (and, to some
extent, B), the quencher is released (frag-
ment 1) to create the optically active frag-
ment 2 (Fig. 1B). Additional cleavage of
LUM015 or fragment 2 yields the opti-
cally active fragment 3 (Fig. 1A). High-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
revealed distinct peaks for fragments 2
and 3 (Fig. 1C). The low-level fluorescence
detected from LUM015 itself is from ~1%
Cy5 fluorescence not absorbed by the
quencher. Patient plasma samples showed
a strong peak corresponding to fragment
3 as well as a smaller peak representing
fragment 2 and uncleaved LUM015 (Fig.
1D), and human plasma profiles showed
fragment 3 levels increasing during the first
8 hours after injection followed by clear-
ance at a slower rate (Fig. 1E).
We then injected mice with and with-
out primary STS tumors with LUM015
and measured [fragment 3]plasma over time
after administration. At 1 hour, the con-
centration of fragment 3 in plasma peaked
in mice with tumors, but by 2 hours, plas-
ma levels were similar to mice with no
tumor, suggesting that fragment 3 was
appreciably produced in nontumor tissues
(Fig. 1F). In tumor tissue, most of LUM015

 was metabolized, whereas in blood, muscle, liver, and kidney tissue,
half or more of LUM015 remained uncleaved (fig. S1). In contrast
to fragment 3 being the major metabolite after in vivo administration
of LUM015 to patients, fragment 2 was the predominant cleavage
product in vitro.
LUM015 fluorescently labels tumor
cells in mice
To test the specificity of LUM015 for
tumor cells, we administered LUM015
(3.5 mg/kg) via tail vein injection into
16 mice with primary STS in the lower
extremity. This dose of LUM015 was chosen
on the basis of preclinical studies performed
with other protease-activatable probes in
the same mouse model (17). Six hours later,
we resected the STS and normal muscle
from the contralateral leg. Fluorescence
imaging of the resected tissues revealed
a mean tumor fluorescence that was
nearly fivefold higher than that of muscle
(Fig. 2A). In a mouse model of breast
cancer, LUM015 fluorescence was signif-
icantly greater in tumor than in muscle
(Fig. 2B).
Because tumors consist of cancer and
stromal cells, we next investigated to what
extent LUM015 labeled these cells using
mice with tumors that express yellow flu-
orescent protein (YFP). After 6 hours, tu-
mors resected from mice injected with
LUM015 had a significantly higher pro-
portion of Cy5+ fluorescent cells compared
to control animals given saline (Fig. 2C).
About 62% of the LUM015-labeled cells
were YFP+ tumor cells, and less than 10%
wereCD11b+tumor-associatedmonocytes
and macrophages (Fig. 2C), indicating that
most Cy5-labeled cells were tumor cells.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyp-
ing of genomic DNA from the Cy5+ cells
thatwereYFP−/CD11b−revealedthatmost
of these cells were tumor cells, which acti-
vated LUM015 but may have lost expres-
sion of the YFP marker, mixed together
with some CD11b− stromal cells (fig. S2A).
Conversely, in pure populations of YFP+/
CD11b+ cells, the proportion of Cy5+ cells
was higher in the tumor cell population
than in the monocyte population, but the
efficiency of labeling in tumor cells was
about 20% in mice (fig. S2).
Having demonstrated that LUM015
fluorescently labels sarcoma cells, we next
used an autochthonous mouse model of
STS with marginal resection to determine
if residualfluorescence inthe tumorbed af-
ter surgical removal of the tumor predicted
local recurrence. Residual fluorescence within the tumor bed was de-
termined intraoperatively as fluorescence exceeding 80% of the
minimum signal from the excised tumor (fig. S3) (17). After imaging
the tumor bed, the surgical wound was closed, and the mice were
monitored for local recurrence–free survival. All mice positive for

 residual fluorescence at the time of surgery developed local recur-
rence of their tumors within 70 days of surgery. In comparison, only
one-third of the mice without residual fluorescence in the tumor
bed experienced local recurrence within 200 total days of follow-up
(Fig. 2D).
LUM015 is safe in humans
After demonstrating that LUM015 selectively labeled sarcoma and breast
cancer in mice, we performed a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial of
LUM015. This trial enrolled 15 patients, 12 with STS and 3 with invasive
ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast. Four of the 12 STS patients had
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), and the other eight
represented several different STS subtypes. The tumor subtypes,
grade, size, and anatomic locations are described in Table 1. LUM015
was administered to six patients at a 0.5 mg/kg dose, six patients at a
1.0 mg/kg dose, and three patients at a 1.5 mg/kg dose, according to a
modified 3 + 3 design (NCT01626066). These human doses were
chosen on the basis of the estimated effective dose of 3.5 mg/kg in
mice, which often corresponds to a lower effective dose in humans
owing to differences in the ratio ofbodysurfaceareatobodyweight(19).
Surgical removal of the tumors immediately followed by ex vivo fluo-
rescence imaging of the resected specimens was done either the same
day as probe injection (at ~6 hours) or the following day (at ~30 hours).
Tissue samples imagedex vivo were biopsiedfor subsequent histological
analysis.
LUM015 was well tolerated by study subjects, and no adverse phar-
macological activity or hypersensitivity reactions occurred during the
study (table S1). All subjects experienced green chromaturia, which
was expected based on the blue color of LUM015. Two sarcoma patients
had wound healing complications, which is within the expected range for
this patient population and not considered related to LUM015; both of
these patients had received preoperative radiation therapy, which is
known to delay wound healing in STS patients (20). Patient 11 experi-
enced a minor transient elevation of liver function tests for aspartate
aminotransferase at 59 U/liter (normal range, 15 to 41) and alanine
transaminase at 58 mg/dl (normal female range, 14 to 54) 8 hours after
LUM015 administration, which was determined to be only possibly re-
lated to the investigational probe and therefore did not meet the criteria
for adverse pharmacological activity, as defined by the clinical protocol
(table S2). Notably, the tissue imaged for patient 10 did not include tumor,
and therefore, this patient was excluded from tumor tissue analyses.
Co-clinical studies in mice and humans show
similar pharmacokinetics
Blood samples were collected from mice and patients at regular intervals
after intravenousadministration of LUM015, and liquid chromatography–
tandemmassspectrometry(LC-MS/MS)wasusedtomeasure[LUM015]plasma
at these time points. Summary pharmacokinetic parameters suggesting
a linear dose response in humans are reported in fig. S4. Plasma clear-

 LUM015 were similar (Fig. 3A). Tumor fluorescence in the first six
humans imaged at 30 hours was lower than fluorescence measured in
mice at 6 hours, but in both mice and humans, absolute tumor fluores-
cence was significantly higher when measured 6 hours after LUM015
administration compared to 30 hours (Fig. 3B). In contrast, we did not
find a significant effect of imaging time on the tumor-to-normal tissue
fluorescence ratio (T/N) in humansor mice (Fig. 3C). Thus, the imaging
time point was shortened to 6 hours after LUM015 administration for
the remainder of the phase 1 trial. Furthermore, at 6 hours, the fluores-
cence ratio (tumor/normal) measured in humans administered the
highest LUM015 dose (1.5 mg/kg) was significantly higher than those
measured in the two lower-dose cohorts (Fig. 3D).
LUM015 fluorescence is tumor-selective in STS and breast
cancer patients
To determine if preoperative administration of LUM015 results in
tumor-specific fluorescence, we compared the absolute fluorescence in
the tumor with the absolute fluorescence in adjacent normal tissue from
all patients (Table 1), except for patient 10. The presence or absence of
cancer in the samples was confirmed by subsequent histological analysis
by a pathologist blinded to the imaging data (table S3). Normal muscle,
adipose, or breast tissue from the margin of tissue resected around the
tumor was used for the normal tissue comparison unless otherwise noted
in table S3. Three representative examples of ex vivo imaging from a
patient with a high-grade UPS of the thigh, a patient with a high-grade
myxofibrosarcoma of the thigh, and a patient with a high-grade IDC of
the breast are shown (Fig. 4, A to C). UPS is the most common type of
STS in the trial and is phenotypically most similar to the mouse model
in our preclinical studies. Myxofibrosarcoma is locally aggressive, and
complete resections are challenging; thus, these patients may particular-
ly benefit from this intraoperative imaging technology.
For each patient, we imaged one to six tumor and normal tissue
sites that were histologically confirmed, and the mean fluorescence
value is reported. Overall, tumor fluorescence was significantly higher
than matched normal tissue fluorescence with a mean tumor/normal
fluorescence ratio of 4.1 (Fig. 4D). The tumor/normal fluorescence ratio
was less than or equal to 1 in two of the patients, both of whom were
imaged at the 30-hour imaging time point and had low-grade sarcomas
(well-differentiated liposarcoma and myxoinflammatory fibroblastic
sarcoma/hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor). Furthermore, we
found that across all patients, the means of absolute tumor, muscle,
and adipose fluorescence values were significantly different (Fig. 4E).
Biodistribution and protease activation contribute to
tumor fluorescence
After determining that fragment 3—with Cy5, no PEG— was the major
LUM015 metabolite in human plasma (Fig. 1), we measured the con-
centrations of both fragments and intact LUM015 in human tissues
(table S4) and in a cohort of 18 mice injected with LUM015 (1.5 mg/kg).
At 6 hours, [fragment 3]tumor correlated significantly with tumor fluo-
rescence in mice and in humans (Fig. 5A). A similar analysis of frag-
ment 2 showed a weaker correlation with tissue fluorescence (Fig. 5A).
To measure the contribution of proteolytic probe activation to tumor-
selective fluorescence, we calculated the fraction of LUM015and its me-
tabolites that were present in the optically active state for each mouse
sample. In the mouse cohort, sarcomas had a fraction of activated probe
(FAP)of0.38,whichwasabout50%higherthannormal muscle (Fig. 5B).
In human tumor samples imaged at 6 hours, tumors had a FAP of 0.26,
which was about 60% higher compared to normal tissues (Fig. 5B), but
this difference did not reach statistical significance, even at 30 hours.
In the mouse STS cohort and the human STS patients imaged at
6 hours with normal muscle available for comparison (patients 8, 11, 12,
13, and 14; table S3), tumor/muscle fluo-
rescenceratioswerecorrelatedwiththecor-
responding activation ratio; however, this
correlation was significant only for the
mouse samples (Fig. 5C). In an analysis in-
clusive of all patients, there was a significant
correlation between fluorescence and acti-
vation (fig. S5A). To measure the contribu-
tion of biodistribution to tumor-selective
fluorescence, the total concentration of
LUM015 and its cleavage products, [total
probe (TP)], was determined for each sam-
ple. In both the mouse and human STS
cohorts, sarcomas had a [TP] that was
greater than normal muscle (Fig. 5D). Ad-
ditionally, [TP] was higher in human tu-
mors imaged at 6 hours when compared
to tumors imaged at 30 hours (fig. S5B).
Furthermore, we found that tissue fluores-
cence and [TP] had a significant positive
correlation in the mouse cohort, the hu-
man STS cohort, and the overall human
data set (Fig. 5, E and F).
To image tumors with a probe that does
not require protease activation, we injected
STS-bearing mice with either LUM015 or
LUM033, a constitutively active fluorescent

 imaging probe identical to fragment 2 (also from Lumicell Inc.). Six hours
after injection, resected tumors had a tumor/normal fluorescence ratio
twofold higher for LUM015 than for LUM033 (Fig. 5G). Therefore,
protease activation may serve to double the level of tumor-to-normal
contrast that is achieved by tumor-selective biodistribution alone. These
findings suggest that tumor-selective distribution of LUM015 is a critical
determinant of T/N, which is further enhanced by tumor-specific pro-
tease activation.
Because biodistribution is one of two major determinants of tumor-
specific fluorescence measured after administration of LUM015, we used
immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry to further examine the
distribution of LUM015 to tumor and normal tissues. As a control for
immunofluorescence, we used formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections
of tumor tissue from human sarcoma pa-
tients not injected with LUM015. Patients
who had been injected with LUM015
showed a positive signal for PEG, whereas
the control tissues did not (Fig. 6A). In a
breast cancer sample from patient 15 that
contained both areas of tumor and adja-
cent normal tissue, PEG signal localized
to areas of tumor, with less intense staining
in normal tissue (Fig. 6B). Areas adjacent
to tumor containing a lymphocytic infil-
trate were also negative for PEG staining.
The amount of PEG staining was signifi-
cantly less in normal muscle and breast tis-
suescomparedtosarcomasandbreastcancer,
respectively(Fig.6,CandD).Theseresultsfor
PEG staining, together with the quantifica-
tion of LUM015 and its metabolites, sug-
gest that tumor-selective distribution of
LUM015 may serve to delineate the tumor
margin while protease activation intensifies
the contrast between tumor and normal
tissue types for intraoperative imaging.
DISCUSSION
There is an unmet need for a real-time
method to determine the presence of mi-
croscopic residual cancer within the tu-
mor bed at the time of surgery, which
could reduce the need for re-resection,
lowerthe ratesof localrecurrence,andper-
sonalize adjuvant therapy. A particularly
attractive approach to detect residual dis-
ease is fluorescence imaging because it can
be functionally and/or molecularly targeted
and provide cellular resolution with pene-
tration depths of up to several millimeters
(11). Protease-activated fluorescent imag-
ing probes were first introduced more than
15years ago to provide optical contrast be-
tweentumorandnormaltissues(14,21–23).
Many of these probes have been tested in
preclinical models. This is the first study to use these probes to image
human cancers and investigate the relative importance of protease activa-
tionversusbiodistribution for achieving tumor-to-normal tissue contrast.
We show here that the PEGylated, protease-activated probe LUM015

STS and breast cancer. Flow cytometric studies of tumors from LUM015-
injected mice showed that most fluorescently labeled cells were tumor
cells, and less than 1/10 were tumor-associated monocytes and macro-
phages. The labeling of tumor-associated macrophages likely occurs be-
cause these cells also express high levels of proteases (24), and the
intraoperative identification and removal of these cells may, in fact, be
beneficial to patients because these cells are associated with tumor

 progression and metastasis (25, 26). In mice injected with LUM015,
residual fluorescence within the tumor bed was highly predictive of
local recurrence, suggesting that this intraoperative imaging system could
be useful to guide surgery and tailor adjuvant therapy.
In a first-in-human phase 1 trial in patients undergoing surgical re-
section of STS or breast cancer, we found that LUM015 is safe and well-
tolerated at a dose that allows for detection of tumor-specific fluorescence.
We observed that the plasma clearance profile of LUM015 in humans
and mice is similar. On the basis of allometric scaling, we expected
that the clearance rate would be significantly slower in humans (27, 28)
so that a greater interval of time between LUM015 administration and
tumor resection would be required to allow for optimal tumor-to-normal
tissue contrast. Our results are consistent with the findings that stan-
dard allometric scaling does not accurately predict human pharmaco-
kinetic parameters for PEGylated compounds (29). On the basis of
this information, we modified the phase 1 clinical trial to include im-
aging at the 6-hour time point, resulting in higher tumor fluorescence
in human cancers than imaging at 30 hours.
Consistent with data from mice and
dogs(18),whenpatientswithSTSorbreast
cancer were injected with LUM015 before
surgery, we found tumor tissue fluores-
cence measured ex vivo to be significantly
higher than fluorescence measured from
adjacent normal tissues. It is important to
note that this study included patients with
both sarcoma and breast cancer, and that
within these tumors, different subtypes
were included. A T/N of greater than
1 was measured in 12 of 14 patients, in-
dicating that LUM015 may be effective
for fluorescent labeling of many differ-
ent types of cancer. However, the human
T/N reported in this study were mea-
sured in ex vivo bulk tissue, and future
clinical trials with LUM015 with in vivo
tumor bed imaging will be necessary to
define a clinically meaningful T/N cut-
off. Nevertheless, the in vivo tumor bed
imaginginourmouseexperimentssuggests
that LUM015 can provide a sufficient T/N
for detecting residual cancer.
Tissue measurements of LUM015,
PEG, and its metabolites showed that se-
lective biodistribution in tumors was an
important factor in tumor-selective imag-
ing. Tumor-specific protease activation
serves to enhance the contrast that is es-
tablished with differential distribution, sug-
gesting that by targeting the tumor through
both mechanisms simultaneously, a larger
tumor-to-normalcontrastisachieved.How-
ever, in mice, we found that the genera-
tion of fragments in vivo did not require
the presence of cancer and could be formed
in isolated blood, muscle, liver, and kidney.
This suggests that protease activation does
not fully account for the tumor/normal
ratio, and instead is established in part by tumor-selective accumulation
through the enhanced permeability and retention effect.
This study shows that preoperative administration of LUM015 to
patients with sarcoma or breast cancer results in tumor-specific flu-
orescence that can be detected upon ex vivo imaging of resected tissues.
However, future clinical studies will be needed to measure fluorescence
in vivo, specifically residual cancer cells at the tumor margins. We re-
port in vivo imaging data from mice and show that intraoperative imag-
ing with LUM015 predicts local recurrence with high specificity. However,
somemicewithnegativeresidualfluorescencediddeveloplocalrecurrence.
Therefore, it will be necessary to optimize fluorescence thresholding
methods to increase the sensitivity of the system while maintaining high
specificity.
This work presents a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial of an in-
travenously administered, protease-activated fluorescent intraoperative
imaging probe. We have shown that LUM015 is safe for use in humans
and generates tumor-specific fluorescence. These studies support future
clinical trials of LUM015 using intraoperative imaging of the tumor bed

 and comparing imaging results with histopathology. A feasibility study
of intraoperative imaging with the LUM system has recently started for
breast cancer patients (NCT02438358), but it may be possible to use the
probe for patients with other cancers, such as sarcoma (as demonstrated
in mice) and gastrointestinal cancers. Our co-clinical studies in mice
and humans reveal that pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic param-
eters are conserved across species, which may aid in the translation of
other preclinical imaging agents for human use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Co-clinical study design
In this co-clinical study, data regarding the pharmacokinetics, specificity,
and mechanism of action of LUM015 were gathered in both mice and
humans. Preclinical studies in the mice provided justification for a phase
1 clinical trial in humans. During the clinical trial, parallel mouse studies
were conducted to further explore clinical observations regarding
LUM015 pharmacokinetics and the mechanism of tumor-selective flu-
orescence. The objective of the controlled laboratory experiments was to
use a primary mouse model of STS and orthotopic models of breast
cancer to investigate the in vivo activity of LUM015 and explore the
mechanism of LUM015 distribution and activation in vivo.
All animal studies were performed in accordance with protocols
approved by the Duke University and Massachusetts General Hospital
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Sample sizes were
selected before initiating the study based on previous intraoperative im-
aging studies conducted in the laboratory (17), and power calculations
were performed as described previously (30). Data collection was
stopped if a smaller sample size achieved statistical significance. No
outliers were excluded in this study. The mice in this study were not
randomized to their treatments and were selected on the basis of avail-
ability. The investigators were not blinded when performing tissue flu-
orescence measurements.
The primary objective of the single institution, open-label, nonran-
domized phase 1 trial (NCT01626066) was to determine a safe and
recommended dose of LUM015 that labels tumors. Secondary objec-
tives included obtaining ex vivo imaging information of the tumor and
any adjacent normal tissue as well as collecting pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic information. Patients with the diagnosis of STS
or breast cancer scheduled for tumor resection were included. Patients
treated with neoadjuvant radiation therapy were included in the study
based on our previous data that radiation therapy does not alter the
fluorescence from protease-activated imaging probes in a mouse model
of STS (31). The sample size was determined on the basis of a modified
3 + 3 dose escalation design to provide information on the relationship
between dose and fluorescence signal while observing patients for
adverse pharmacological activity. No outliers were excluded in this
study. Informed consent was obtained from each patient, and the
study was approved by the Duke University School of Medicine and
Copernicus Institutional Review Boards. The study was also run under
an Investigational New Drug application filed with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. A safety monitoring committee was formed to
protect the rights, safety, and welfare of participants, and additional
monitoring was done by the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) Safety Over-
sight Committee.
Patients underwent standard operative and perioperative treatment.
Resected patient tissues underwent standard surgical pathology proce-
dures before being imaged and sampled for the study with the guidance
of a clinical pathologist blinded to the fluorescence imaging measure-
ments. Safety evaluations, described in Supplementary Materials and
Methods, were conducted before and after peripheral intravenous
administration of LUM015 at three predetermined doses: 0.5, 1.0, or
1.5 mg/kg. LUM015 was administered either the day before or on the
morning of surgery. LUM015 was supplied free of charge from Lumicell
Inc. Patient blood samples were collected before and after LUM015 ad-
ministration for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies.
Fluorescent agent administration and imaging
MicewereadministeredLUM015orLUM033viatailveininjectionwhen
tumors reached about 1000 mm3 (4 to 5 mm in diameter). Blood samples
for pharmacokinetic studies were obtained from the submandibular vein.
After a specified time interval, the animals were euthanized, and tissues
were removed for fluorescence imaging and other analyses. For the local
recurrence study, tumors were removed and intraoperative assessment
of residual fluorescence was performed as described previously (17). The
handheld LUM imaging device was described previously (17), and the
specifications are provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Normal and tumor tissues were identified grossly, and the imaging tip
was applied to the tissue to obtain two to three images of the same loca-
tion. The tissue was biopsied at the site of imaging for identification of
the tissue type by histological analysis (H&E) and measurement of
LUM015 and its metabolites (fragment 2 and Cy5-Lys).
Image processing was performed using a custom script developed
in the Matlab programming environment (MathWorks) using standard
corrections for background and signal distribution (32), described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods. Mean pixel intensities derived
from the Matlab script are reported in this study. For visual representa-
tion of images, the contrast and brightness of images were adjusted as
described previously (17) so that the reader can appreciate the differ-
ences in fluorescence intensities between tumor and normal tissue.
Histological analysis, immunohistochemistry,
and immunofluorescence
FFPE sample tissues were sectioned to create 5-mm-thick slides for H&E
staining, PEG immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence
studies. Staining and quantification methods are described in Supple-
mentary Materials and Methods. Slides were reviewed by a clinical pa-
thologist specializing in STS (D.M.C.), who was blinded to tissue
fluorescence measurements.
Flow cytometry
KPYmice harboring primary sarcomas were injectedwitheitherLUM015
(3.5 mg/kg) or PBS vehicle, and tumors were collected 6 hours after injec-
tion. Cells were dissociated from tumors according to methods described
previously (33). Total cells dissociated from tumors were incubated with
rat anti-mouse CD16/32 immunoglobulin G (IgG) (BD Pharmingen) and
phycoerythrin-Cy5–conjugated anti-mouse CD11b IgG (eBioscience).
Data were collected from at least 200,000 cells by FACSCanto (BD Phar-
mingen)andanalyzedbyFlowJo(TreeStarInc.).GenomicPCRanalysisto
show recombination of the mutant Kras allele was performed with the
following primers: (i) 5′-GTCTTTCCCCAGCACAGTGC-3′; (ii) 5′-
CTCTTGCCTACGCCACCAGCTC-3′; (iii) 5′-AGCTAGCCACCAT-
GGCTTGAGTAAGTCTGCA-3′. The wild-type Kras allele yields a
622-bp band, the unrecombined LSL-KrasG12D allele yields a 500-bp
band, and the recombined 1-loxP-KrasG12D allele yields a 650-bp band.

 Plasma and tissue metabolite measurements
Concentrations of LUM015 and its metabolites in plasma and
tissue samples were determined using LC-MS/MS as well as HPLC
with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD). A detailed methodology is
presented in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistics
Results are presented as means ± SEM unless otherwise indicated. Before
analysis, all data were displayed graphically to determine whether para-
metric or nonparametric tests should be used. Two-tailed Student’s t test
wasperformedtocomparethemeansoftwo groups,andamatchedpairt
test was used when comparing fluorescent measurements from the same
patient. A Mann-Whitney test was performed to compare the means of
two groups when data were distributed nonparametrically. Two-way
ANOVA was performed to examine the interaction between two
independent variables such as dose and imaging time, and one-way
ANOVA was used when measuring the effect of only one variable, such
as tissue type. These were followed by Bonferroni or Tukey’s post hoc
multiple comparison tests for pairwise comparisons of individual treat-
ments or tissue types. For local recurrence studies, Kaplan-Meier analysis
was performed with the log-rank test for statistical significance. To find
the correlation of two different measurements from the same sample, we
determinedthePearsoncoefficient(r)andr2.Significancewasassumedat
P < 0.05. All calculations were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad).
