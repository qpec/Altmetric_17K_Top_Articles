Purpose: The study objective was to test the utilization of a crosslinked, thiolated hyaluronic
acid (CMHA-S) film for treating corneal chemical burns.
Methods: Burns 5.5mm in diameter were created on 10 anesthetized, male New Zealand white
rabbits by placing a 1N NaOH soaked circular filter paper onto the cornea for 30s. Wounds
were immediately rinsed with balanced salt solution (BSS). CMHA-S films were placed in the
left inferior fornix of five injured and five uninjured animals. Five animals received no
treatment. At 0h, 48h, 96h, and on day 14 post chemical burn creation, eyes were evaluated
by white light imaging, fluorescein staining, and optical coherence tomography (OCT).
Corneal histology was performed using H&E and Masson's Trichrome stains.
Results: Image analysis indicated biocompatible CMHA-S treatment resulted in significant
decreases in the areas of corneal opacity at 48h, 96h, and on day 14 postoperatively.
A significant increase in re-epithelialization was seen 14 days post injury. CMHA-S treated
corneas showed significantly less edema than untreated burns. No pathological differences
were observed in corneal histological samples as a result of CMHA-S treatment.
Conclusions: CMHA-S films facilitate re-epithelialization and decrease the area of corneal
opacity in our corneal alkali burn rabbit model.

Introduction
Regardless of occupational safety measures, clinicians still
treat a number of ocular surface injuries caused by heat, acids,
or alkali agents. Clinicians also treat patients with severe facial
and eyelid burns that result in devastating ocular injuries
leading to vision loss and/or blindness [1]. Not only are these
injuries still prevalent with alkali or acidic agents representing
11.5
–22.1% of ocular traumas [2], chemical and thermal injuries
are some of the most clinically difficult to treat [3]. In the case
of chemical burns, alkali burns are more severe and caustic as
alkali agents penetrate the ocular tissues more rapidly due
to lipophilic properties. This results in tissue necrosis and
ischemia which often gives the eye a misleading, but quiescent
white appearance [4]. From a molecular standpoint, exposure
to alkali compounds causes the saponification of fatty acids in
cell membranes as they penetrate the corneal stroma and
destroy proteoglycans and collagens [4]. As corneal alkali
burns heal, the injured tissues secrete proteolytic enzymes
resulting in additional and continuous tissue damage [4]. For
these reasons, the clinical rehabilitation of corneal alkali burn
patients is often very challenging given long term complica-
tions due to reoccurring corneal epithelial erosions and
chronic inflammation which leads to vision loss [5]. Patients
with devastating facial burns frequently have damage to the
periorbital tissues (i.e. conjunctiva, periorbital fat, glands and
eyelids) that can indirectly lead to similar outcomes as a
direct insult. Regardless if the patient is suffering from
chemical or thermal burn injury, the vision loss that can
occur due to these injuries is the same when the ocular surface
is not healed in a timely manner. As a result, clinicians are in
need of more advanced therapeutics to treat these patients.
While amniotic membrane, buccal skin grafts, tarsorrha-
phies (partial suturing of the eyelids), and bandage contact
lenses are available as therapies, these treatments fail in
treating the most severe ocular burn patients. In severe
injuries, a topical treatment such as ascorbate drops, citrate
drops, corticosteroids, or bandage contact lenses may be
utilized in conjunction with amniotic membrane transplanta-
tion, limbal stem cell transplantation, or a corneal transplant
to resolve any corneal scarring or opacity [4]. When a stable
ocular surface cannot be restored via limbal stem cell
transplantation, a keratoprosthesis placement may be re-
quired. Despite interventions, however, suboptimal outcomes
still frequently occur. Furthermore, the reliance on topical eye
drop administration is not sufficient. Topical ophthalmic
drops dissipate almost completely after drop administration
[6,7] and must also be applied frequently. This is a problem for
burn patients or elderly patients who might not be able to place
a drop without assistance. A treatment that eliminates drop
administration would not only be an improved treatment
option, but would also decrease the burden of care. As a result,
there is a need for more sophisticated ophthalmic treatment
modalities that eliminate ophthalmic drops as well as promote
wound healing. To this end, Jade Therapeutics, Inc. (wholly
owned subsidiary of EyeGate Pharmaceuticals, Salt Lake City,
UT, USA) has developed a continuous drug delivery system
that would eliminate the need for drop administration while
promoting wound healing. This drug delivery system is a
proprietary thiolated, crosslinked hyaluronic acid (CMHA-S)
polymer for ocular use that has been demonstrated to
accelerate wound closure following photorefractive keratec-
tomy (manuscript under review). Furthermore, when applied
as a liquid gel, this polymer has a residence time on the
ocular surface of longer than two hours (manuscript under
review) due to unique engineering. This polymer, however,
can also be manufactured as a thin, flexible film which can be
inserted into the inferior fornix to provide sustained release
of therapeutic agents. Crosslinked CMHA-S is a versatile,
biocompatible polymer that combines the documented wound
healing properties of HA [8] with drug-delivery capabilities to
provide an innovative ophthalmic treatment when installed
quickly (without the use of suturing or tissue glue) directly to
the ocular surface [9]. This type of treatment not only has the
potential to provide prolonged therapeutic delivery and
promote ocular tissue repair, but also would not rely on self-
administration making it extremely beneficial for ocular
burn management. Due to the intrinsic healing properties of
this polymer, we investigated this novel CMHA-S treatment
modality to treat one of the most challenging types of ocular
chemical burns, alkali chemical injures. We hypothesize that
crosslinked CMHA-S films are not only safe, but can also
provide for the advanced treatment of corneal alkali burns as
demonstrated in our ocular alkali chemical model of wound
healing.
2. 
Materials and methods
2.1. 
Animals
Male New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits (2.5
–4.0kg) were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington,
MA) and randomly grouped (N=5 per group). Sample-size
requirement estimates are based on clinical examination
scores and testing at the study endpoint. The sample size was
estimated using a power analysis (SigmaPlot v12.5). Three
treatment groups consisted of animals that received CMHA-S
films on uninjured eyes, animals that received CMHA-S films
with alkali burns, and animals that received no treatment
with CMHA-S films, but had corneal alkali burns. All animal
procedures were performed on anesthetized animals. Proto-
cols were reviewed and approved by the United States Army
Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC). This study was conducted in
compliance with Animal Welfare Regulations, other Federal
statutes relating to animals and experiments involving
animals, and the principles set forth in the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council.
2.2. 
Nictitating membrane removal
The nictitating membrane was removed three weeks prior to
corneal alkali burn creation or film placement. Prior to
nictitating membrane removal, ketamine hydrochloride (Ve-
tOne
1, Boise, ID USA; 35
–45mg/kg), buprenorphine SR-LAB
(0.5mg/kg), and xylazine (5mg/kg) were administered via
intramuscular (IM) injection and animals were placed on
isoflurane (1
–3.5%). Left eyes of the rabbits were anesthetized

 with 0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride (Alcon, Ft. Worth, TX, USA).
A 5% povidone iodine solution (10% povidone-iodine; Purdue
Pharma L.P., Stamford, CT, USA) in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) was utilized to sterilize
the surgical site. A topical antibiotic drop, 0.1% moxifloxacin
(Alcon) was administered before placing the eyelid speculum.
After 
the 
eye 
was 
properly 
draped, 
a 
0.5% 
tetracaine
hydrochloride drop (Alcon) was administered for a second
time. Forceps (#12) were employed to grip the nictitating
membrane and a small (30G) needle was used to inject 0.1
–
0.2ml 2% Lidocaine HCl with Epinephrine 1:100,000 USP
(Hospira, Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA) into the posterior and
anterior 
base 
of 
the 
nictitating 
membrane. 
Westcott
scissors were used to remove the nictitating membrane. A
weck cel sponge was utilized to remove blood, and a high
temperature cautery was used to cauterize the surgical site.
Bacitracin Zinc and Polymixin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Ointment
USP (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY, USA) was applied at
the surgical site. Animals were placed in an oxygen chamber
(39
–40% oxygen) for recovery. Animals were checked twice
daily for three days, treated for pain, and allowed to heal for
three weeks.
2.3. 
Corneal alkali burn creation
Corneal alkali burns 5.5mm in diameter were created on
anesthetized rabbits by soaking grade 52, 175mm thick, 0.015%
ash, circular filter paper (Whatman
1, GE Healthcare Bio-
Sciences, and Pittsburg, PA, USA) in 1N NaOH for 60s before
placing them on the central cornea for 30s. Corneas were
measured with calipers to ensure central burn creation. Burns
were immediately rinsed with 10ml balanced salt solution
(BSS, Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA) and debrided.
2.4. 
CMHA-S film placement
CMHA-S films were fabricated by combining a solution
of thiolated carboxymethyl HA in PBS (final concentration,
16mg/ml) with a solution of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate
(PEGDA; MW 3350) in PBS (final concentration, 15mg/ml).
The resulting solution was aliquoted into silicone molds
(3mm wide�9.9mm long�1mm thick), crosslinked for two
hours, and dried at room temperature. Upon re-hydration, the
CMHA-S films exhibit swelling to yield an oblong, clear, and
flexible film 4mm wide by 15mm long. Dry CMHA-S films were
partially rehydrated in sterile BSS for two minutes before
being placed in the left inferior fornix. Some films were initially
re-hydrated in 0.1% rose bengal dye in sterile BSS before
placement for visualization. Animals were monitored daily for
film retention and any signs of irritation.
2.5. 
Corneal imaging
Images were obtained at 0h, 48h, 96h, and on day 14 post injury
utilizing a camera (7D, Canon USA., Melville, NY, USA) with a
100mm macro lens. Corneal wounds were stained using sterile
fluorescein sodium ophthalmic films USP (Fluorets
1, Chauvin
Laboratory, Aubenas, France) dampened with 100ml sterile
BSS. The fluorescein solution was allowed to remain on the eye
for 10s before being rinsed with BSS. Images of uptake were
captured under cobalt blue light post staining. Percentage
areas of wound closure and areas of corneal opacity were
quantified by a blinded observer as previously described
utilizing ImageJ software (NIH) [10]. Each time point was
compared to 0h post wounding. Following fluorescein imag-
ing, optical coherence tomography (OCT, Bioptigen Spectral
Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)) images
were acquired. OCT images were analyzed with ImageJ
software by measuring the widest section of the central
cornea [11]. In vivo confocal microscopy images (Heidelberg
Retina Tomograph (HRT3) Franklin, MA, USA) were obtained
on uninjured, healthy control animals, but were not obtained
on injured corneas due corneal opacity.
2.6. 
Histology
Eyes from euthanized rabbits were enucleated for histology
on day 14 and fixed in modified Davidson’s solution (Poly
Scientific R&D Corporation, Bay Shore, NY) for 24h before
being transferred to 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Middletown, VA). Globes were
bisected through the burn (when present) and placed, cut
side down, in a megatissue cassette (Fisher Scientific, Fair
Lawn, NJ). Tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned (3
–
4mm), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Fisher
Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) or Masson’s Trichrome (Poly Scientific
R&D Corporation, Bay Shore, NY) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol.
2.7. 
Statistical analysis
Data sets were analyzed by our in-house statisticians using a
repeated measures 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
JMP
1 10 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina,
USA). Independent values are presented as mean�standard
error of the mean (SEM). A P-value of <0.05 was regarded as
significant for all statistical analyses.
3. 
Results
3.1. 
CMHA-S films are retained in the inferior fornix
Although previous studies have demonstrated the ability of
crosslinked CMHA-S in a drop formulation to facilitate corneal
repair [12], it was unknown if CMHA-S in a hydrogel film would
remain in the inferior fornix long enough to be an effective
treatment. Therefore, retention of the film was an important
part of our study. Films were rehydrated in sterile BSS prior to
placement into the inferior fornix of healthy rabbit eyes. Films
were observed to be safely retained and biocompatible in the
inferior fornix for 96h after placement and remained struc-
turally intact (Fig. 1). Daily gross observations of the films
revealed that, while the films did not completely degrade or
dissolve, some films exhibited mild wear and tear likely due to
mechanical forces of eye movement. No irritation, redness, or
swelling of the eye or ocular structures was observed in any
animal due to film placement. Animals were monitored for
14 days post film placement and observed for any signs of
pathology.

 3.2. 
CMHA-S films are biocompatible
CMHA-S films were placed in the inferior fornix of animals
with uninjured, healthy eyes and compared to healthy
untreated (no CMHA-S films) eyes as a control (Fig. 2). White
light imaging, fluorescein staining, in vivo confocal microsco-
py, and corneal surface histology were carried out 14days post
CMHA-S film placement (Fig. 2). White light imaging revealed
no signs of corneal opacity. A lack of fluorescein uptake
indicated that no corneal epithelial defects were present in
either group (Fig. 2). In vivo confocal images as well as H&E and
Masson’s Trichrome staining also did not reveal any corneal
pathology in either group (Fig. 2).
3.3. 
CMHA-S films treatment results in a decrease in the
area of corneal opacity
After the burn creation CMHA-S film placement, white light
images (Fig. 3A) were taken at 0h, 48h, 96h, and on day 14 to
observe corneal opacity. At 48h, our results revealed a 17%
significant (*P<0.05) decrease in the area of corneal opacity in
CMHA-S treated eyes compared to a 0% decrease in non-
treated alkali burns (Fig. 3B). By 96h, there was a 30%
significant decrease of (**P<0.01) in the area of corneal opacity
in CMHA-S treated eyes while non-treated animals showed
only a 4% decrease in corneal opacity (Fig. 3B). This difference
continued to increase over time. On day 14 post injury, a 50%
significant (***P<0.001) decrease in opacity was observed in
CMHA-S treated eyes while a 16% overall decrease was seen in
non-treated injuries (Fig. 3B). Our results revealed significantly
smaller areas of corneal opacity in CMHA-S treated injuries
versus non-treated injuries and that differences between the
two groups increased over time.
3.4. 
CMHA-S films improve corneal re-epithelialization
Given that previous animal and clinical studies have shown
that formulations of crosslinked CMHA-S in a liquid drop
facilitates corneal epithelial wound closure [12], a key focus of
our study was to determine the effect of CMHA-S film
treatment on corneal re-epithelialization. Fluorescein images
(Fig. 4A) were taken at 0h, 48h, 96h, and on day 14 after the
creation of corneal alkali burns and the placement of CMHA-S
films to detect corneal epithelial defects via fluorescein
uptake. Corneas treated with CMHA-S films exhibited less
fluorescein uptake at 48 and 96h post injury and on day 14
Fig. 2 – CMHA-S films are biocompatible. Two weeks after the placement of CMHA-S films, white light, fluorescein, and in vivo
confocal (epithelium, stroma, endothelium) images were taken of non-treated and CMHA-S treated healthy eyes. Tissues were
collected 14days post film placement and corneal sections stained using H&E and Masson’s Trichrome staining. The data are
representative of five animals per group.

and monitored daily for retention. CMHA-S films are shown in the inferior fornix at 0 and 48h and on day 14 post placement as
indicated by the arrows (!). The data are representative of five total animals.

 (Fig. 4B). Fluorescein uptake at 48h indicated that CMHA-S
treated wounds exhibited 99% re-epithelialization at 48h
compared to approximately 86% re-epithelialization of non-
treated control wounds resulting in a 13% percent improve-
ment in re-epithelialization in CMHA-S treated wounds over
non-treated wounds.
These injuries did initially re-epithelialize quickly but,
also eroded regardless of treatment. By 96h, areas of
fluorescein 
uptake 
began 
to 
erode 
and 
became 
larger
(Fig. 4A). Fluorescein uptake revealed that CMHA-S treated
wounds were 90% re-epithelialized while non-treated controls
were 80% re-epithelialized. By day 14, there was a significant
(**P<0.01) difference in the fluorescein uptake between
groups. CMHA-S treated wounds were 83% re-epithelialized
and the non-treated controls were 63% re-epithelialized
showing a 20% difference in fluorescein uptake (Fig. 4B).
3.5. 
CMHA-S treated alkali burns exhibited reduced corneal
swelling
To determine if treatment with CMHA-S films had an effect on
total corneal thickness, OCT images (Fig. 5A) were collected at
0h and on day 14 post injury. OCT images revealed that there
were no differences in corneal thickness at 0h showing the
Fig. 3 – CMHA-S films decrease areas of corneal opacity. At 0, 48, and 96h and on day 14 after the creation of a corneal alkali burn
and the placement of CMHA-S films, white light images were taken. Images show the area of corneal epithelial wound closure of
non-treated wounds (A) and those treated with CMHA-S films (B). The histogram (C) represents the percentage area of corneal
opacity at 0, 48, and 96h and on day 14 compared to 0h post injury. The values are expressed as mean�SEM and are
representative of four animals per group. The comparisons of the percentage areas of corneal opacity in CMHA-S treated versus
non-treated wounds were performed by utilizing a 2-way repeated measures ANOVA. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.

(*P<0.05) of approximately 200mm in corneal thickness
between burns CMHA-S treated burns (779mm�70 SEM) and
non-treated burns (975mm�67 SEM) (Fig. 5B).
3.6. 
Corneal surface histology appears normal in both
treatment groups
H&E staining performed on the central burn revealed no
marked differences in corneal pathology between CMHA-S
treated and non-treated burns 14days post injury (Fig. 6).
No neovascularization was observed and inflammation was
minimal. H&E sections revealed that a thin layer of the
epithelium was present at the time of enucleation on day 14,
but had not yet returned to full thickness in either group. These
results indicate that CMHA-S treatment has no negative
consequences on the treatment of these corneal alkali burns.
4. 
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to assess the use, safety, and
effectiveness of CMHA-S films as a more advanced treatment
in our corneal alkali burn model. We assessed corneal re-
epithelialization, corneal opacity, corneal thickness, and
Fig. 5 – CMHA-S films result in decreased corneal thickness post corneal alkali burn injury. OCT images were taken immediately
after the corneal alkali burn injury creation at 0h and on day 14days post injury in non-treated wounds (A) and CMHA-S treated
wounds (B). The histogram (C) represented corneal thickness values as mean�SEM and are representative of five animals per
group. Comparisons between the treatment groups were made utilizing a 2-way repeated measures ANOVA. *P<0.05.

placement, tissues were harvested, processed, and stained with H&E. Histology revealed a thin corneal epithelial layer in both
treatment groups without any major pathological differences between treatment groups. No neovascularization was seen in
either group. The corneal epithelium and stroma are labeled accordingly.

 corneal pathology. Our studies revealed not only CMHA-S
film 
biocompatibility, 
but 
also 
that 
CMHA-S 
treatment
significantly increases corneal re-epithelialization while sig-
nificantly decreasing areas of corneal opacity and swelling.
The re-epithelialization of these burns is of particular interest
given the effects wound closure has on the clinical etiology
of ocular burns. In our studies, non-treated burns did not
completely re-epithelialize at any point during the study
unlike CMHA-S treated burns which re-epithelized by 48h. By
96h post injury, however, corneal epithelial defects had
reoccurred in both non-treated and treated groups. It is
common to see these reoccurring corneal epithelial erosions in
corneal alkali burn progression and was found to be unrelated
to CMHA-S film treatment. Studies have noted that corneal
erosions occur as early at 72h after a corneal alkali burn and
can persist for up to 3 months [13]. The clinical progression of
alkali chemical injuries can be divided into four phases:
immediate, acute, early reparative, and late reparative [14,15].
After the immediate phase when the injury occurs, the acute
phase (days 1
–7) begins and a superficial layer of the epithelium
forms to protect the cornea from enzymes in tears as the
stroma attempts to heal [15]. During the early reparative phase
(days 8
–20), corneal ulceration is most likely to occur and
chronic inflammation begins. By the late reparative phase
(after day 20), the injury begins to resolve with either a good or
poor prognosis [14,15]. It should be noted that this study
focused on wound healing through the early reparative phase
and these eyes did not receive additional anti-inflammatory
drops during the course of the study. We observed that our
model 
mimicked 
the 
human 
clinical 
progression, 
thus
providing insight on how CMHA-S treatment affected burn
pathology. CMHA-S films appear to specifically improve this
process resulting in the complete re-epithelialization by 48h
post injury. Even though epithelial defects reoccurred in both
treatment groups by 96h, CMHA-S treated wounds were
smaller at 96h compared to non-treated controls and were
significantly smaller on day 14. Thus, it appears that the
CMHA-S 
films 
continue 
to 
improve 
re-epithelialization
through day 14 resulting in a more favorable outcome. We
hypothesize that increased re-epithelialization in CMHA-S
treated burns protects the eye from inflammatory mediators
and enzymes in the tear film that lead to corneal perforation
and thinning [15] and also decreases inflammatory cytokines
released by the injured surface epithelium and underlying
stroma. The reduction in inflammatory burden may lead to
less corneal swelling, edema, and corneal opacity. This is
consistent with our results that show significantly less corneal
opacity (48h, 96h, and on day 14) and swelling (day 14) in
CMHA-S treated burns versus non-treated burns.
Studies have shown that HA-based hydrogels facilitate re-
epithelialization in extremity burn injuries [9,12,16]. This is
consistent with our findings showing the impact of CMHA-S
hydrogel film treatment on corneal burn re-epithelialization.
Interestingly, other forms of HA such as non-crosslinked 0.2%
HA drops have no long term impact on the healing of corneal
alkali burns [17], while a 1% thiolated crosslinked derivative of
HA (CMHA-SX) in a drop formulation has been shown to re-
epithelialize corneal alkali burns by 48h [12]. Taken together,
these results indicate that the specific formulation HA,
concentration, and delivery method may impact treatment.
5. 
Conclusions
Our study is the first to our knowledge in which CMHA-S in the
form of a hydrogel has been shown to facilitate the re-
epithelialization of corneal alkali burns. Our results demon-
strate that CMHA-S films may be a viable treatment to promote
re-epithelialization while decreasing corneal opacity and
swelling. Future studies aim to characterize the release of
HA from the films as well as the exact mechanisms by which
CMHA-S 
is 
promoting 
re-epithelialization 
including 
the
investigation of how cytokines and inflammatory mediators
may be modulated.
