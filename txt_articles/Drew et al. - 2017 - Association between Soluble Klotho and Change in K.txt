ABSTRACT
CKD appears to be a condition of soluble klotho deficiency. Despite known associations between low soluble
klotho levels and conditions that promote kidney damage, such as oxidative stress and fibrosis, little information
exists regarding the longitudinal association between soluble klotho levels and change in kidney function. We
assayed serum soluble a-klotho in 2496 participants within the Health Aging and Body Composition study, a
cohort of older adults. The associations between soluble klotho levels and decline in kidney function (relative
decline: eGFR decline $30%; absolute decline: eGFR decline .3 ml/min per year) and incident CKD (incident
eGFR ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and .1 ml/min per year decline) were evaluated. We adjusted models for de-
mographics, baseline eGFR, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, comorbidity, and measures of mineral metabo-
lism. Among participants, the mean (SD) age was 75 (3) years, 52% were women, and 38% were black. Median
(25th, 75th percentiles) klotho level was 630 (477, 817) pg/ml. In fully adjusted models, eachtwo-fold higher level
of klotho associated withlowerodds of declineinkidneyfunction(odds ratio,0.78[95%confidenceinterval,0.66
to 0.93] for 30% decline in eGFR, and 0.85 [95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.98] for .3 ml/min per year decline
in eGFR), but not of incident CKD (incident rate ratio, 0.90 [95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.04]). Overall, a
higher soluble klotho level independently associated with a lower risk of decline in kidney function. Future
studies should attempt to replicate these results in other cohorts and evaluate the underlying mechanism.

Klotho is a transmembrane proteinwhich serves as the
cofactor for fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) to
bind to its cognate receptor and regulate phosphorus
and vitamin D metabolism.1,2 The soluble form of
klotho is reported to have antiaging properties which
may be mediated via multiple systemic effects includ-
ing regulation of insulin signaling and prevention of
vascular calcium deposits, oxidative stress, and fibro-
sis.3–8 The kidney has the highest levels of klotho ex-
pression and is thought to be the major source of
soluble klotho,9,10 which is released through proteo-
lytic cleavage of the transmembrane form as well as

dition of klotho deficiency, with animal models of CKD demon-
strating decreased klotho gene expression, lower klotho levels in
kidney tissue, and lower circulating soluble klotho.7,12,13
Geneticstudieshavedemonstratedthatmutationsorknockout

of kidney disease,6–8,14 whereas restoration of klotho in rodent
models of CKD results in improvement and/or prevention of
kidney damage.15,16 These findings, coupled with the potential
beneficial systemic effects discussed above, raise the possibility
that klotho deficiency may not just be a marker of CKD, but
instead serve as a causative factor for its development.17

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Among 3075 participants, 299 did not have samples available
for the klotho assay, whereas 280 were missing values for cys-
tatin C at either baseline or at least one follow-up visit, leaving
2496 with complete data available for analysis. Fifty four per-
cent of the remaining participants had two follow-up measures
of eGFR (years 3 and 10), whereas 43% had a single follow-up
eGFR measure from year 3, and 3% had a single follow-up
eGFR measure from year 10. The average (SD) age of partic-
ipantswas75(3)years,with52%women,and38%black(Table
1). The median klotho level was 631 pg/ml (25th–75th per-
centile = 477–817 pg/ml), whereas the median FGF-23 level
was 46 pg/ml (36.7–60.2). The mean baseline eGFR was 73
(18) ml/min per 1.73 m2 and 23% of participants had a base-
line eGFR of ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2.
Across quartiles of klotho, minimal differences were ob-
served in the prevalence of comorbid conditions. Those in
the lowest klotho quartile had lower prevalence of albuminuria
(urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] .30 mg/g) and
modestly higher FGF-23 and C-reactive protein concentra-
tions. Participants in the lowest quartile of klotho also had
the lowest eGFR and highest cystatin C, whereas those in the
highest quartile were more likely to be black. No differences
were seen for age, sex, diabetes status, or for calcium, phos-
phorus, and parathyroid hormone.
Klotho and Change in Kidney Function
The mean annual rate of decline for all included participants
was 1.77 ml/min per year (64.76 ml/min per year). Four hun-
dred and five participants (16%) experienced a 30% decline in
kidney function, whereas 702 (28%) experienced an absolute
decline in kidney function .3 ml/min per year. Each two-fold

 higher klotho was associated with 20% lower odds of relative
decline in kidney function. This association remained signif-
icant and essentially unaltered in all multivariable models, in-
cluding after adjustment for demographics, baseline kidney
function, CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors,
and measures of mineral metabolism (Table 2). Similar find-
ings were observed when klotho was examined in quartiles,
with the highest quartile demonstrating 30% lower odds of
kidney function decline compared with the lowest quartile.
Each two-fold higher klotho was also associated with lower
odds of absolute decline in kidney function, with the association
becoming statistically significant in stepwise multivariable mod-
els, including the fully adjusted final model (Tables 3). In cate-
goric analyses, the highest quartile of klotho was associated with
lower odds of absolute decline, but did not reach statistical sig-
nificance in comparison with the lowest quartile.
Klotho and Incident CKD
Five hundred and eighty-two participants were excluded from
analysis due to having eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at base-
line, leaving 1914 participants available for analysis. Incident
CKD was observed in 536 (25%), with an incident rate of 4.8%
per year. Each two-fold higher klotho appeared to be associ-
ated with a lower rate of incident CKD, although this was not
statistically significant in linear or categoric analyses (Table 4).
Splines
In spline analysis, we observed a consistent pattern for all three
outcomes, with a linear association between low levels of klo-
tho and higher odds of each outcome, followed by a plateau,
which occurred approximately near the observed median of
klotho (630 pg/ml) (Figure 1).
Interactions

actions were noted between klotho and eGFR with relative eGFR
decline, absolute decline, or incident CKD (P values of 0.15, 0.3,
and 0.7, respectively). No significant interactions were noted
between klotho, phosphorus, and each outcome (P values of
0.8, 0.9, and 0.2, respectively).

strated an association between low soluble klotho and decline in
kidneyfunction.Therelationshipwasrobustandappearstohave

CKD, although the results were not statistically significant.
We are not aware of any previously published studies that
have evaluated the relationship between serum klotho and
change in kidney function over time. Multiple previous studies
have demonstrated cross-sectional associations between lower
eGFR and lower soluble klotho levels, with the lowest levels
observed in patients requiring hemodialysis.18–20 The inter-
pretation of many of these studies is that the development of
CKD may result in physiologic or cellular conditions, which
lead to decreased klotho expression and production.9,10,12
However, there is also evidence which suggests that low klotho
may be a risk factor for the development of kidney disease,
rather than simply a marker of kidney disease.20
Klotho is reported to be an antiaging gene4 whose tran-
scription results in a transmembrane protein that acts as a
coreceptor necessary for FGF-23 function within the kid-
ney.11,21 Klotho is also found in soluble form in serum, CSF,
and urine11,18 and is formed by two distinct processes: (1)
proteolytic degradation of the membrane-bound form and
(2) an alternative gene transcription product.11,22,23 Although
the exact mechanism of action of soluble klotho remains to be
identified at this time, soluble klotho has been shown to in-
fluence multiple cellular and endocrine pathways including
insulin release and the renin-angiotensin system,24–26 with
higher expression associated with less pathologic evidence of
aging such as kidney fibrosis, systemic markers of oxidative
stress, and vascular calcification.6–8,27,28 Each of these effects
has been hypothesized to have kidney protective effects.20 In-
deed, restoration of exogenous klotho in klotho-deficient ro-
dents results in both the prevention and reduction of kidney
damage.14–16 We acknowledge, however, that low klotho could
serve as a surrogate for comorbidity or an early indicator of
kidney function decline, and thus simply be a marker for those
at risk of future kidney decline. Arguing against this possibility

 is the lack of attenuation in our analyses after adjusting for age,
multiple comorbidities, and key laboratory findings that are
associated with kidney function decline.
The strengths of this study include a large and diverse co-
hort, accurate ascertainment of risk factors, and repeated mea-
sure of kidney function over a moderate follow-up period.
There are also several limitations to the this study. First, con-
cern has been raised as to the accuracy of the commercially
available assay which we have also used in this study29–31 Spe-
cifically, the assay has been reported to detect high levels of
soluble klotho in rodents with CKD,32 raising questions as to
whether the current assay is specific for soluble klotho, and a
recent study demonstrated that the commercial ELISA may
experience a decrease in accuracy after samples have under-
gone multiple freeze-thaw cycles.18 Although the commercial
assay we used may be less specific for klotho when compared
with highly labor intensive immunoprecipitant immune blot
assay methods,18 our results are in agreement with the major-
ity of previously published cross-sectional studies.18–20 Fur-
thermore, inaccuracy in the assay could be hypothesized to
dilute results and bias toward the null, rather than produce a
false positive finding. In addition, our samples did not un-
dergo multiple freeze-thaw cycles, eliminating this potential
source of inaccuracy. We did not have simultaneous assess-
ment of both the exposure (year 2) and baseline kidney func-
tion, although the measures were within 1 year of each other,
and there is little evidence that klotho levels change substan-
tially over time in stable patients.33 Importantly, we also did
not have follow-up measures of kidney function outside of
year 3 or 10 which results in imprecision in slope estimates
and differentiation between relatively short-term and chronic
changes in eGFR challenging. In addition, use of a relatively
short interval for outcomes on the basis of year 3 eGFR may
not be reflective of longer-term outcomes. We also note that
we did not have other measures of kidney disease such as
albuminuria in follow-up. Finally, our cohort did not include
any participants with advanced CKD, so we are unable to gen-
eralize our results to this higher-risk population.
Insummary,wefound anindependentassociationbetween
low klotho levels and decline in kidney function. These results
need to be confirmed in additional cohorts, incorporating
other measures of klotho, and should include individuals
with more advanced CKD. In addition, potential mechanisms
whichmayexplaintheobservedassociationsneedtobefurther
evaluated.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Population
Health ABC is a prospective cohort initiated in 1997 with a goal of
assessing how health conditions affect age-related physiologic and
functional status. The study population consists of 3075 persons
aged 70–79 years at baseline with equal numbers of men and women
and approximately one third black. All persons included were deter-
mined to be free of disability in activities of daily living and free of

 functional limitation at baseline. All participants who had measures
of klotho and kidney function at baseline, and at least one repeat
measure of kidney function (n=2496), were included in this study.
Exposure
Klotho was assayed using a commercially available sandwich ELISA
test (IBL-International, Japan) from never-thawed frozen serum
stored at 270°C and obtained at the year 2 visit, approximately 1
year after the baseline visit. This assay is reported to have a sensitivity
of 6.15 pg/ml,34 and demonstrated an interassay coefficient of 18%.
The assay has been used in multiple peer-reviewed publica-
tions19,30,31,35 and demonstrates reasonable correlation with more
labor-intensive assay methods using synthetic antibodies and immu-
noprecipitation-immunoblots, particularly when the number of free-
thaw cycles is low.
Covariates
All covariates were obtained at baseline enrollment (year 1 visit) with
the exception of measures of mineral metabolism, which were ob-
tained at the year 2 visit. Demographics (age, sex, and race) were
obtained by self-report at study enrollment. CVD status was defined
as a prior history of coronary artery disease, stroke, or heart failure.
Diabetes was defined as use of hypoglycemic agents, self-reported
history, fasting plasma glucose level $126 mg/dl, or 2-hour oral glu-
cose tolerance test result $200 mg/dl. Systolic and diastolic BP were
obtained by trained and certified clinical staff from the right arm
using a conventional mercury sphygmomanometer with the partic-
ipant in a seated position. Hypertension was defined as systolic BP
$140 mmHg, diastolic BP $90 mmHg, or current use of antihyper-
tensive medications and a self-reported physician’s diagnosis of hy-
pertension. UACR was determined at baseline. Urine albumin was

whereas urine creatinine was measured by a modified Jaffé method
on a clinical chemistry analyzer (Siemens). C-reactive protein was
measured using an ELISA kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).
Measures of mineral metabolism including calcium, phosphorus,
parathyroid hormone, and FGF-23 were measured at year 2, concur-
rentwithklothomeasurement,fromfrozenstoredsamples.Inparticular,
FGF-23 was measured in never-thawed plasma EDTA using a commer-
cial ELISA that measures the full-length peptide (Kainos Laboratories,
Japan). This assay is widely used and may be advantageous in individuals
with milder degrees of CKD, as it may provide more accurate results at
low levels of FGF-23 compared with the C-terminal assay. For this study,
the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 5.0% and the interassay co-
efficient of variation was 10.7% (mean 42 pg/ml).
Outcomes
Cystatin C was measured at baseline, as well as years 3 and 10, from
stored frozen serum samples at the Health ABC core laboratory (Uni-
versityofVermont,Burlington,VT)usingaBNIInephelometer(Dade
Behring Inc., Deerfield, IL) and a particle-enhanced immunonephe-
lometric assay (N Latex Cystatin C).36 As in prior Health ABC stud-
ies,37,38 serum cystatin C was used as the primary measure of kidney
function rather than serum creatinine for two reasons. First, cystatin
C measures were calibrated across all samples, whereas there was a
shiftinthecreatinineassayfromnon-IsotopeDilutionMassSpectrometry–
traceable (baseline) to Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry-traceable
during the study (years 3 and 10). Second, cystatin C is less influ-
enced by age, sex, and race,39 and in particular muscle mass, and has
been shown to be more strongly associated with adverse outcomes in
the elderly population.40,41 Among 61 healthy individuals with three
cystatin C measurements over a 6-month period, the intraindividual
coefficient of variation was 7.7%, reflecting long-term stability of the
measurement. eGFR was calculated using a validated cystatin C–based
estimating equation.39,42 Using eGFR, three kidney outcomes were de-
fined as follows:
Change in Kidney Function
(1) Relative decline in kidney functionwas defined as an eGFR decline
of 30% or greater. When two follow-up measures of eGFR were avail-
able, the last available value (year 10) was used. Recent publications
and a recent workshop between the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion and the National Kidney Foundation have argued that a 30%
decline in GFR is an acceptable clinical endpoint for clinical trials, as
it predicts the development of ESRD.43,44
(2) Absolute decline in kidney function was defined as a decline in
eGFR of .3 ml/min per year.45 Rate of decline per year was deter-
mined by creating a slope using either two (single follow-up eGFR) or
three (two follow-up eGFR) data points. This definition has been
used in prior publications37,38 and has been shown to be associated
with increased mortality in older adults.45
Incident CKD
Incident CKD was defined as eGFR of ,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at any
point during follow-up and an annual absolute decline .1 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 per year, with the latter requirement in place to avoid
inclusion of participants with minor changes in eGFR. Participants
with an eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at baseline were excluded from
this analysis.
Statistical Analysis
We examined baseline characteristics of participants across quartiles
ofklotho.TheseweresummarizedwithmeansandSD,ormediansand
interquartile ranges for highly skewed variables, or proportions for
categoric variables. For eGFR and UACR, we also included the pro-
portion of participants in each quartile below or above clinically rel-
evant cut points (eGFR,60 ml/min per1.73 m2, UACR.30 mg/g). To
examine the functional form of the association between klotho and
each outcome, we fitted unadjusted natural cubic splines with knots
placed at the quartiles and extreme values were excluded so as to avoid
implausible extrapolation of shapes of the association.
Klotho and Change in Kidney Function
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the re-
lationship between klotho and decline in eGFR. Klotho was examined
as both a continuous variable (log base 2, so that interpretation would
be per doubling of the exposure) and categorized as quartiles. Model 1
was unadjusted. Multivariable models were then sequentially con-
structed through a series of nested models using prespecified variables
as follows: model 2: adjusted for age, sex, race, study site, and baseline
eGFR; model 3: additionally adjusted for diabetes, CVD, hyperten-
sion, and UACR; model 4: additionally adjusted for calcium, phos-
phorus, parathyroid hormone, and FGF-23. On the basis of a priori
hypotheses that a synergistic relationship could potentially exist be-
tween klotho and either FGF-23 or baseline eGFR, we then evaluated
if the association between klotho and decline in GFR was modified by
FGF-23 or baseline eGFR by including interaction terms for each in
the final multivariable models.
Klotho and Incident CKD
Poisson (log-link) regression was used to model the incidence rate
ratio of CKD as a function of klotho level with robust variance esti-
mationandanoffsetforfollow-uptime.Exposurevariableswereagain
examined as both linear terms and by category (quartiles) to assess for
nonlinear relationships. Identical multivariable models were con-
structed as described above, including interaction terms.
Analyses were conducted using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows, Version 23.0. Released 2015. IBM Corp, Armonk, NY)
and Stata (Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. 2013. StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX.) A two-sided P value of ,0.05 was considered
statistically significant for all analyses including interaction terms.
