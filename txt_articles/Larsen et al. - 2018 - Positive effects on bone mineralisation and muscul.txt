ABSTRACT
Objectives We investigated whether musculoskeletal
fitness of school children aged 8–10 years was affected
by frequent intense PE sessions.
Design and participants 295 Danish school children
aged 8–10 years were cluster randomised to a small-sided
ball game group (SSG) (n=96, four schools, five classes),
a circuit strength training group (CST) (n=83, four schools,
four classes) or a control group (CON, n=116, two
schools, five classes).
Intervention SSG or CST was performed 3×40 min/week
over 10 months. Whole-body dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) scans were used to determine areal
bone mineral density (aBMD), bone mineral content
(BMC) and lean body mass (LBM). Flamingo balance,
standing long jump and 20-m sprint tests were used to
determine muscular fitness.
Results Analysis of baseline-to-10 months change scores
showed between-group differences in favour of the
interventions in whole-body aBMD (SSG vs CON: 8 mg/
cm2, 95% CI 3 to 13; CST vs CON: 7 mg/cm2, 95% CI 2
to 13, p<0.05) and leg BMC (SSG vs CON: 11 g, 95% CI
4 to 18; CST vs CON: 11 g, 95% CI 3 to 18, p<0.05).
SSG had higher change scores in leg aBMD compared with
CON and CST (SSG vs CON: 19 mg/cm2, 95% CI 11 to
39, p<0.05; SSG vs CST: 12 mg/cm2, 95% CI 3 to 21,
p<0.05), and CST had higher change scores in whole-body
BMC compared with CON (CST vs CON: 25 g, 95% CI 10
to 39, p<0.05). Both training types resulted in higher
change scores in postural balance (SSG vs CON: 2.4 fewer
falls/min, 95% CI 0.3 to 4.5, CST vs CON: 3.6 fewer falls/
min, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.9, p<0.05) and jump length (SSG vs
CON: 10%, 95% CI 5 to 16%; CST vs CON: 9%, 95% CI
3 to 15%, p<0.05). No between-group differences were
observed for sprint performance or LBM (p>0.05).
Conclusions In conclusion, 3×40 min/week with SSG or
CST over a full school year improves bone mineralisation
and several aspects of muscular fitness of children aged 8–
10 years, suggesting that well-organised intense physical
education classes can contribute positively to develop
musculoskeletal health in young children.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of osteoporotic fractures is increasing
in the ageing population1 and the fracture risk
relates, among other things, to bone strength,
muscle strength and postural balance.2 It has been
shown that weight-bearing activities during child-
hood have a positive effect on variables related to
bone strength3 4 and that low bone strength in child-
hood is associated with a higher fracture risk in later
life.5 This indicates that physical activity in child-
hood leads to residual benefits in bone density and
strength in adulthood (tracking);2 6 thus, it is of
great
importance
to
investigate
the
osteogenic
impact of different weight-bearing training types
during childhood that may have the potential to
decrease the risk of osteoporosis in later life. The
school setting is considered a favourable platform
for promoting a physically active lifestyle, as there is
a possibility of reaching all children and most
importantly those who have low fitness levels and
impaired musculoskeletal health, including low bone
mineral density (BMD). Special attention should be
given to girls with limited physical activity in leisure
time and low calcium intake,7–9 who therefore miss
the opportunity to optimise bone mass in the peri-
pubertal years that are characterised by a high
responsiveness to osteogenic bone loading activity.5
School-based exercise could preferably be integrated
in the physical education (PE) lessons, and also in
extracurricular physical activities.5 As the National
Osteoporosis Foundation states in a position paper
on the impact of lifestyle factors on the development
of peak bone mass,5 there is strong evidence that
physical activity in youth does have a positive impact
on bone accrual and improvement of peak bone
mass in the third decade of life. However, the osteo-
genic effect varies due to differences in the exercise
activities regarding important factors such as load
magnitude, load rate, load frequency and repetitive-
ness.10 Thus, some studies have found that school-
based interventions involving increased volume of
physical activity have positive effects on BMD in
girls as well as boys,11–14 while others have found
no effect on bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD
in children attending sports schools compared with
traditional schools.15 However, in the same study,
positive effects of practising leisure-time sports were
found, and this potential contradiction may be
related to the phenomenon that training-induced
effects are dependent on the type of activity and the
intensity of training.
Several studies from our research group have
demonstrated favourable cardiovascular, metabolic

 and musculoskeletal effects of football training in healthy
women and men aged 20–75 years as well as in various patient
groups.16–18 Interestingly, a recent randomised controlled trial
(RCT) study found a significant correlation between the average
number of decelerations during a football session and the mag-
nitude of bone effects over time,18 which may be ascribed the
larger osteogenic impact associated with higher strain magnitude
and rates when moving fast. Furthermore, various types of
strength and high-impact jump training have been observed to
have positive effects on functional capacity and bone mineralisa-
tion in healthy men and women across the lifespan.16
19
However, further studies are required in order to elucidate the
extent to which these findings are applicable in children.
Recent investigations from our group have shown that the
aerobic and musculoskeletal intensity is high in children during
a variety of team sports (football, basketball and unihockey).20 21
It has been shown that, prior to puberty, footballers have super-
ior bone health status compared with children not active in
sports clubs as well as children active in sports clubs practising
non-weight-bearing sports such as swimming and cycling.22–24
Moreover, longitudinal studies have shown that football partici-
pation throughout the pubertal years results in a twofold
increase in femoral BMC and areal BMD (aBMD).25 26 It has
also been suggested that circuit strength training (CST) can
enhance selected measures of lower body muscle power in chil-
dren,27 28 whereas effects of CST on childhood bone health are
unclear.29 Moreover, it has not yet been investigated whether
specific school-based interventions with small-sided ball game
activities or CST are affecting gross motor skills in young
children.
Thus, the aim of the present study was to conduct a long-
term cluster-randomised controlled training intervention to
investigate whether the bone mineralisation and muscular fitness
of children aged 8–10 years were affected by 10 months of high-
intensity school-based training regimes (3×40 min/week) con-
sisting of odd-impact small-sided football and other ball games
or circuit strength training with weight-bearing exercises.
METHODS
A total of 295 Danish third-grade school children aged 8–
10 years from six schools (three urban and three rural schools)
were cluster randomised into the SSG (n=96, four schools, five
classes), CST (n=83, four schools, four classes) or control
group (CON, n=116, two schools (one urban, one rural), five
classes).

rounds of block randomisation were used to assign one control
school and two training intervention schools in each geograph-
ical area, and to assign the 2–3 school classes in the training
intervention schools to SSG or CST
, with both training types
represented at all training intervention schools. T
wo staff
members packed sets of identical, sealed, opaque envelopes with
the names of the schools from the rural and urban area, and the
names of the school classes, respectively, along with two sets of
envelopes that contained the numbers 1–2, 3–4 and 5–6. A
third researcher who was blinded to the packing of envelopes
chose envelopes and rolled a dice to decide group allocation
and training type, respectively.
All pre and post-tests were performed during school time in
the beginning and at the end of the school year by university
staff members with the support of school teachers. Child assent
and written informed parental consent were obtained for all
participants. The study was approved by the committees on
Biomedical Research Ethics for the Capital Region of Denmark

The

study
is
part
of
the
large-scale
Frequent
Intense
Training—Football,
Interval
Running and Strength Training ‘FIT FIRST’ study with a total
of >400 children (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02000492). The
present study focuses on the effects of 3×40 min weekly (2
hours weekly) SSG and CST training versus control, whereas
data for the two training groups with high-frequency, low-
volume (5×12 min weekly) SSG and interval running will be
presented in future publications.
All the children were interviewed and examined by a medical
doctor who also assessed T
anner stage. One child was excluded
because of physical disabilities. During the interview, the chil-
dren were asked whether they participated in organised sport
activities at least once per week (yes or no) (table 1).
Training
The two different types of training (SSG and CST) were led by
trainers engaged part time by the university. The training ses-
sions were performed at the schools in the afternoon, three
times per week, spread over 4 or 5 days of the week. SSG con-
sisted mainly of 3v3 football (75% of training sessions), but also
3v3 basketball and unihockey (floorball). For practical reasons,
some other small-sided games or team sizes (maximally 4v4)
were occasionally used. Each training session began with a 3–
5 min warm-up with drills relevant to the ball game used in that
particular session.
CST consisted of 30 s all-out exercise periods interspersed by
45 s rest periods. Half the time, it was conducted as traditional
circuit training with 6–10 stations with plyometric and strength
exercises such as jumps, sit-ups, push-ups and other dynamic
exercises as well as static strength training using upper and
lower body, as well as the core. The other half consisted of well-
known games activating the children in the same way as the
traditional CST
. The instructors recorded attendance of partici-
pants in a training log as either present, not present or half
present if someone arrived late or left early.
Anthropometric measures and dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry
Barefooted and wearing light clothing, the children were
weighed (T
anita WB-110MA, T
anita, Europe) and height was
measured (235 Heightronic Digital Stadiometer, QuickMedical,
Issaquah, W
ashington, USA). On the basis of weight and height,
a whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan
(Lunar Prodigy; E Medical Systems, Madison, Wisconsin, USA)
using Encore software V
.13.5 (Encore, Madison, Wisconsin,
USA) was performed in appropriate mode (thin, thick or
normal) for estimation of whole-body and leg aBMD and BMC
as well as lean body mass (LBM). The manufacturer states a coef-
ficient of variation (CV) for whole-body bone variables of <1%.
This is supported by Margulies et al 30 who also evaluated the
leg region in children from a whole-body scan and report CV
values of 1.11–1.36% for the regional (leg) bone parameters.
For the individual child, pretesting and post-testing were con-
ducted at the same time of the day and the children were
instructed to fast for at least 2 hours and to visit the toilet prior
to the scan. The children were scanned in a supine position.
Postural balance
Postural balance was evaluated using the single-legged Flamingo
balance test31 performed on a 3 cm wide, 5 cm high and 50 cm
long balance beam. The participant was instructed to stand bare-
footed on one leg on the bar, with eyes open, holding the
contralateral leg at the ankle joint. The number of times the par-
ticipant fell off the bar (defined as touching the ground or/and
unable to hold the contralateral leg at the ankle joint) within

 1 min of stance time was counted and used as an indicator of
postural balance.31 The participants were given one try with
each leg before choosing their preferred leg for the test. If 20
falls were counted before 1 min standing time had elapsed, the
time was noted and used to calculate the expected number of
falls during a full 1 min period. The test has been proved to be
reliable and valid as a test for balance in young children.32
Maximal horizontal jump length
The maximal horizontal jump test was performed as a squat
jump (SJ) with the arms held steady behind the back and from
standing erect, starting with a knee flexion to the squat position
which was held in 2 s before a maximal forward jumping and as
a countermovement jump (CMJ) allowing use of the arms. After
a standardised warm-up, the children were placed behind a line
with their feet parallel and shoulder-width apart starting with
the CMJ followed by the SJ after a 2 min rest period. In both
jumps, the distance from the starting line to the heel was mea-
sured. Maximal horizontal jump length is a reliable method that
is well correlated with muscular leg strength in children.33 34
20 m sprint test
After the warm-up, the children performed 2×20 m maximal
sprints with at least 2 min of recovery between sprints. All
sprints started from a standing position and were timed using
two ports of light sensors (Witty Microgate, Bolzano, Italy)
placed at 0 m (positioned 30 cm in front of the standing start
position) and 20 m: the fastest time was recorded as the test
result.35 Sprinting abilities rely on muscle strength, body weight
and neuromuscular function.
Gross motor skill
Time (in seconds) to complete a coordination wall with three
stages of increased difficulty was used to evaluate gross motor
skill.36 Each stage consisted of a table (9×8 A5 size squares)
with numbered marks from 1 to 10. Half the numbers were
blue, half were red. The two lowest ranks were separated from
the higher ranks by a thick line. The participants had a red
mark on the right hand and a blue mark on the left hand, and
were instructed to touch the numbers from 1 to 10 in the
correct order, and as fast as possible with the hand (above the
thick line) or foot (below) matching the colour of the number.
If the participants made a mistake, they were told to correct the
mistake and proceed, while the clock was still ticking. Stage 1
and stage 2 were unilateral. Stage 1 had no crossing over the
vertical midline, stage 2 was with crossing over the vertical
midline, over the vertical midline, and stage 3 was bilateral.
Each child was given three attempts at each stage and the best
(shortest) times at each stage were summed to provide a com-
bined score of stages 1–3.
Player load
The activity profile during training was measured using a port-
able global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer device
(MinimaxX S4, Catapult Innovations, Canberra, Australia). The
GPS units were placed into the manufacturer-designed harness,
which was worn during training. After recording, the data were
downloaded and analysed using proprietary software (Sprint,
Catapult Sports, Canberra, Australia). Player load is an estimate
of training intensity combining the instantaneous rate of change
in acceleration in three planes—forward (fwd), sideways (side)
and upwards (up)—using the formula:

Player load seems to be highly correlated with Edwards’ and
session-rating of perceived exertion (RPE) methods37 and has
shown high reliability, suggesting that accelerometers may be
used to determine the physical demands of various types of
high-intensity training.38 The percentage of training time with
player load values of 0–1, 1–2 and >2, as well as mean values
was obtained from the software.38
Statistics
Data are presented as means (±SD) unless otherwise stated.
Baseline values for the three intervention groups (CON, SSG
and CST) were compared using one-way analysis of variance. To
evaluate the intervention-induced effects, change scores from 0
to 10 months for CON, SSG and CST were compared using
one-way analyses of variance with SAS Enterprise guide 7.1
(SAS institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA). Only data sets
with values pre and post were included in the analysis.
Between-group differences in training intensity were tested
using one-way analysis of variance. The significance level was
set at 0.05.
RESULTS
No between-group differences were observed in height, body
weight, bone variables, lean mass or functional capacity at base-
line (figure 2, tables 1 and 2). During the 10-month interven-
tion period, no differences were observed in height and weight
change scores for SSG and CON, whereas CST increased more
in height than CON (change scores CST vs CON: 0.38 cm,
95% CI 0.06 to 0.71 cm, p<0.05) (table 1).
Training intensity
Mean player load was higher (p<0.01) in the SSG than in the
CST group (0.48 (±0.15) vs 0.34 (±0.09)). The proportional
time spent in the highest player load zones was not different
between SSG and CST groups (zones >2: 3.2 (±2.7)% vs 2.1
(±1.5)%; p>0.05), whereas more time was spent in the SSG
group in the medium player load zone (zone 1–2: 11.9
(±5.9)% vs 6.3 (±2.2)%; p<0.01) and less time in the lowest
player load zone (zone 0–1: 84.9 (±7.5)% vs 91.4 (±3.5)%;
p<0.01) compared with the CST group.
Intervention effects on BMD and bone mass
During the 10-month intervention period, the SSG and CST
groups improved whole-body aBMD (change scores SSG vs
CON: 8 mg/cm2, 95% CI 3 to 13 mg/cm2, p=0.001; CST vs
CON: 7 mg/cm2, 95% CI 2 to 13 mg/cm2, p=0.005) and leg
BMC (change scores SSG vs CON: 11 g, 95% CI 4 to 18 g,
p=0.002; CST vs CON: 11 g, 95% CI 3 to 18 g, p=0.004)
(figure 2). From 0–10 months, SSG had higher change scores in
leg aBMD compared with CON as well as CST (SSG vs CON:
19 mg/cm2, 95% CI 11 to 39 mg/cm2, p<0.001; SSG vs
CST: 12 mg/cm2, 95% CI 3 to 21 mg/cm2, p=0.017), and
CST had higher change scores in whole-body BMC compared
with CON (CST vs CON: 25 g, 95% CI 10 to 39 g, p<0.01)
(figure 2).
Intervention effects on muscular fitness
The SSG and CST groups had a reduction in number of falls in
comparison with CON (change scores SSG vs CON: 2.4 falls/

DISCUSSION
The main findings of the present large-scale RCT were that
school-based training interventions with small-sided ball game
and circuit strength training improved bone mineralisation,
jump performance and postural balance over a 10-month period
in school children aged 8–10 years, suggesting that high-impact
PE sessions can be used to promote musculoskeletal health in
young children.
Osteoporosis is an age-related chronic skeletal disease charac-
terised by low bone strength due to reduced bone mass and an
impairment of bone microarchitecture, and it is associated with
increased morbidity and mortality owing to fractures and their
complications.39 Early prevention of osteoporosis is essential,
including the optimisation of peak bone mass, which is attained
in the third decade of life.29 40 As the optimal time for bone
mineral accrual is prepuberty and early puberty,6 any osteogenic
physical activity at this age is likely to be important to prevent
osteoporosis in later life. Some long-term school-based interven-
tion studies involving physical activity have shown no effect on
bone
health.
These
include
studies
involving
low-volume
CST
,41 42 with low ground reaction forces (3.5–5 times body
weight) and also interventions with a threefold higher number
of PE lessons than normally.15 However, it should be empha-
sised that the latter study was not a randomised trial, and the
type and intensity of the physical activity were neither described
nor controlled for. Other studies have revealed an osteogenic
training effect on BMC and/or density in prepubertal children.29
Osteogenic effects were seen in a study using a training pro-
gramme comparable to that of MacKelvie et al41 42 but with
higher ground reaction forces reaching eight times the body
weight,43 and osteogenic effects have also been reported by
Meyer et al14 and Detter et al44 using general PE with frequent
use of demanding jumping activities.
In the present study, 3×40 min/week of small-sided ball
games elevated whole-body aBMD as well as leg aBMD and
BMC, while the same dose of CST induced positive effects on
whole-body aBMD along with increases in whole-body and leg
BMC. Overall, the magnitude of the osteogenic change was
similar to that found in the few other school-based training
studies inducing positive osteogenic health effects,29 implicating
that 3×40 min/week of SSG or CST is as effective as osteogenic
training with other investigated exercise concepts including
plyometric training and gymnastics. The intensity recordings
during training confirmed that the player load and, thereby,
impact were frequently very high during both types of training.
They also showed that the average player load and the time
spent in medium intensity (zone 1–2) were higher for SSG than
for CST
, whereas no difference was observed in the time spent
in the highest player load zone. These findings may indicate that
the time spent with the highest player load is most important
for the training adaptations of medium-volume high-intensity
training in school children aged 8–10 years. Interestingly, the
increase in leg aBMD was significantly higher for ball game
group compared with the CST group, indicating that the small-
sided games had higher involvement of the lower limbs than the
mixed leg and upper body exercises included in the CST
protocol.

 In long-term training studies for children, it is always import-
ant to consider the role of sexual maturity and growth and to
examine whether between-group changes in bone mineralisation
are related to the training regimes or to differences in maturity
and growth. From the T
anner stage classifications, anthropome-
trical measurements and body composition results presented in
table 1, it is clear that there were no differences in T
anner
results or change scores for height and weight when comparing
the ball game group with the control group. On the other hand,
the circuit training group had a 0.4 cm greater change score in
height than the control group, and the fraction of girls with
changed Tanner scores from stages 1 to 2 was higher in the CST
group (36%) compared with the control group (20%) and the
ball game group (19%) (table 1). Together, these results provide
strong support that the observed osteogenic effects of SSGs are
related to the training itself rather than sexual maturity and
growth. With regard to the osteogenic effects in the circuit train-
ing group, it cannot be ruled out that the positive effects were
potentiated by sexual maturity and growth. However, as the
osteogenic effects of circuit training compared with control
were also significantly greater for the boys, despite no differ-
ences in change scores for height and weight for the boys in the
two groups and with all the boys in the two groups staying at
Tanner stage 1 throughout the intervention period, it is likely
that at least part of the observed differences in osteogenic
response between the circuit training group and the control
group is due to the training regime.
Another interesting observation of the present study was that
the intervention effects on bone variables were homogenous
among the four schools using SSG and consistently higher than
in the two control schools, with change scores ranging from
25 to 27 mg/cm2 (27±21, 25±11, 27±11, 27±16 mg/cm2)
for whole-body aBMD and 53 to 67 mg/cm2 (59±35, 53±24,
64±23,
67±32 mg/cm2)
for
leg
BMD
with
ball
games
compared with 16–20 mg/cm2 (20±15, 16±18 mg/cm2) and
40–41 mg/cm2 (40±36, 41±22 mg/cm2) for controls. The bone
effects for CST were more heterogenic from school to school
with chang scores rangingfrom 20 to 39 mg/cm2 (21±11, 23
±12, 39±43, 20±21 mg/cm2) for whole-body aBMD and 32
to 69 mg/cm2 (43±15, 32±38, 69±51, 46±34 mg/cm2) for leg
BMD. These observations suggest that the relatively easy task of
delivering small-sided ball game training that elicits high exer-
cise intensity and high involvement of all participants20 21 can
be done by many different instructors and that the bone effects
of the ball game intervention can be achieved in the capital
region as well as in the countryside regions, thereby increasing
the generalisation of the study results.
In the present study, we also observed a 9% increase in jump
length in both training groups in comparison with the control
group, which is similar to the training-induced effects on muscle
function in prepubertal children after a 7-week high-intensity
interval training (HIIT) programme28 and a plyometric training
programme conducted in elementary schools.27 However, the
effects on muscle strength were greater than improvements
observed
in
other
school-based
interventions
involving
enhanced general physical activity.45 Thus, in the study by
Löfgren et al,45 no jump performance effects were observed in
boys after 2 years of extra PE lessons, whereas positive effects
were observed in vertical jump height in the investigated girls.
Despite the high intensity, we did not observe any significant
effects on either gross motor skill or 20 m sprint time, even
though plyometric training has previously been shown to
improve sprint performance after just 11 weeks of training.46
Last, but not least, we observed that both training types
resulted in an enhanced postural balance. Only a few studies
have investigated the effects of physical activity interventions on
postural balance in healthy children. A Czech study found no
significant effects of a 10-week climbing programme on postural
balance,47 while a Canadian study of specific balance training
using Nintendo Wii or more traditional exercises showed con-
siderable improvements in postural balance of 26% and 23%,
respectively.48 Overall, the present findings show that the
chosen types of high-intensity training, that is, SSG as well as
CST
, had broad-spectrum effects on musculoskeletal health with
an elevated bone mineralisation, improved muscle strength and
an enhanced postural balance, and that both types of training
have combined positive musculoskeletal effects that may have a
preventive effect on the future risk of falls and fractures in later
life.
A major advantage of the present study, apart from the
cluster-randomised controlled design with long-term training,
was that the exercise interventions were well controlled through-
out the intervention period, making it possible to conclude spe-
cifically that medium-volume SSG and CST induced a sufficient
musculoskeletal load to enhance bone formation, postural
balance and jumping performance. Another strength of the
present study is that sexual maturity and growth were measured
with prepost T
anner classifications for all children by the same
medical doctor and state-of-the-art prepost measurements of
height, weight and body composition. However, it should be
acknowledged as a limitation that the number of participants
was
not
sufficiently
high
to
distinguish
between
the
training-induced effects for girls versus boys or for sports club
active versus non-sports club active children and that the control
participants, although high in numbers, only came from one
urban school and one rural school. Moreover, it is considered a
limitation that the overall physical activity of the participants
was not determined before and during the 10-month interven-
tion period, but solely the exercise intensity and the physical
demands of the guided sessions with SSG and CST
.

 In summary, the present study is, as far as we know, the first
RCT to investigate the musculoskeletal effects of a school-based
intervention
involving
small-sided
ball
games
and
circuit
strength training for children aged 8–10 years, and the current
results demonstrate that significant structural and functional
musculoskeletal adaptations can be achieved in a well-controlled
school-based setting. The observations confirm that, in child-
hood, the skeleton adapts to the physiological changes induced
by physical training and suggest that compared with other
physiological training modalities, HIIT and odd-impact training
may be a favoured intervention for achieving musculoskeletal
changes. This may have beneficial consequences for long-term
osteogenic health.
What are the findings?
▸ Small-sided ball game and circuit strength training for
children aged 8–10 years provide high musculoskeletal
impact.
▸ Small-sided ball game and circuit strength training
conducted within the school curriculum are suitable for
improving musculoskeletal health in young children.
▸ The positive effects of well-structured medium-volume ball
game and circuit strength training on bone mineral accrual
are followed by improvements in balance and jumping
distance in young children.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Two evidence-based, well-defined, school-based physical
activity concepts with positive effects on musculoskeletal
health are now developed and tested for young children.
▸ The FIT FIRST concept, with frequent intense training, can be
implemented in the school system for children aged
8–10 years, as well as other settings.
▸ The small-sided ball game and circuit strength training can
be conducted in small areas on a variety of indoor and
outdoor surfaces, thereby providing further potential for a
large-scale implementation.
