 Abstract
 Background & Aims—Childhood obesity is increasing and is associated with adult obesity. 
Antibiotics have been used to promote weight gain in livestock for several decades. Antibiotics are 
commonly prescribed for children, but it is not clear how exposure to antibiotics early in life 
affects risk for obesity. We performed a population-based cohort study to assess the association 
between antibiotic exposure before age 2 years and obesity at age 4 years.
 Methods—We performed a retrospective cohort study of 21,714 children in The Health 
Improvement Network —a population-representative dataset of more than 10 million individuals 
derived from electronic medical records from 1995 through 2013 in the United Kingdom. Eligible 
subjects were registered within 3 months of birth with complete follow-up and height and weight 
were recorded within 12 months of their 4th birthday. Antibiotic exposure was assessed before age 
2 years, and classified based on anti-anaerobic activity. The primary outcome was obesity at age 4 
years. We performed logistic regression analyses, adjusting for maternal and sibling obesity, 
maternal diabetes, mode of delivery, socioeconomic status, year and country of birth, and urban 
dwelling.
 Results—In the cohort, 1306 of the children (6.4%) were obese at 4 years of age. Antibiotic 
exposure was associated with an increased risk of obesity at 4 years (odds ratio [OR]=1.21; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.38). Odds ratios increased with repeated exposures: for 1–2 
prescriptions, OR=1.07 (95% CI, 0.91–1.23); for 3–5 prescriptions, OR=1.41 (95% CI, 1.20–
1.65); for 6 or more prescriptions, OR=1.47 (95% CI, 1.19–1.82). Antifungal agents were not 
associated with obesity (OR=0.81; 95% CI, 0.59–1.11).
 Conclusions—Administration of 3 or more courses of antibiotics before children reach an age 
of 2 years is associated with an increased risk of early childhood obesity.

Antibiotics have been used to promote weight gain in the agricultural industry for decades,. 
This effect has been hypothesized to be mediated via the gut microbiome, with studies 
demonstrating no effect on weight gain in germ-free animals,. The impact of antibiotics on 
animal weight is greater if given earlier in life.
Childhood obesity is strongly associated with the risk of obesity and its complications in 
adulthood. There are limited data addressing the effect of antibiotics on human weight gain, 
despite clear evidence of their overuse in pediatric populations–. Several studies have 
retrospectively examined antibiotic use by relying on parental recall to assess exposure to 
antibiotics. A recent UK study assessed antibiotic exposure in the first two years of life and 
body mass, appreciating an increased risk of obesity at 10 and 20 months, and a trend 
towards a sustained impact at 7 years, though this was not statistically significant after 
adjusting for parental obesity and tobacco use. Duration, dose, antibiotic class, and 
household factors such as sibling obesity were not assessed. A Danish registry examined 
antibiotic exposure in the first 6 months of life and demonstrated an increased risk of obesity 
in children of obese mothers, but noted a protective effect in children of mothers who were

 not obese. Recurrent exposures could not be assessed . An international survey also found an 
association between parental recall of antibiotic use in the first 12 months of life and 
subsequent obesity.
Prior retrospective cohort studies using electronic health records have also suggested an 
association between antibiotics and obesity–. However, because of the limitations of the 
available data, substantial uncertainty remains about the importance of the age of exposure, 
cumulative frequency of exposure, and spectrum of antibiotics that may influence this 
association. Furthermore, there is remaining uncertainty about the potential confounding 
effects of environmental exposures.
In this study, we examined the association between antibiotic use before 2 years of age and 
obesity in a large population-representative cohort in the United Kingdom with complete 
follow-up from birth to 48 months, allowing for complete prescription information, adjusting 
for multiple confounders including sibling and maternal obesity, method of delivery, year of 
birth, socioeconomic status, and early obesity. We also assessed whether repeated antibiotic 
exposures and antibiotics with broader anaerobic coverage, and therefore potentially greater 
impact on the microbiome, were more strongly associated with obesity.
 Methods
 Study design
We performed a retrospective cohort study using data collected prospectively in the scope of 
routine care from 1995–2013 within The Health Improvement Network (THIN). THIN data 
are derived from general practitioners’ electronic medical records (EMR). THIN represents 
approximately 6% of the UK population, includes information on age, sex, socioeconomic 
status, medication use, and has been validated for multiple medical diagnoses–. Height and 
weight data are recorded during clinical care. Mother-child pairings and siblings can be 
determined using a unique household code.
 Study population
We identified individuals who registered with a THIN practice within 3 months of birth who 
had complete follow-up to 48 months. Individuals were required to have a recorded height 
and weight within 12 months of their fourth birthday. Height and weight must have been 
recorded within 1 week of each other. To ensure recording completeness, all individuals born 
prior to a practice’s installation of the Vision electronic medical record were excluded, as 
were those who had died, transferred out of a practice, or did not reach their fourth birthday 
prior to the end of data recording. Given the potential for increased antibiotic or 
glucocorticoid exposures, we excluded individuals with diagnostic codes for reactive airway 
disease or asthma.
 Study outcome
The primary outcome was obesity at 48 months, defined using BMI z-scores calculated from 
the UK World Health Organization Term growth reference table using both recorded height 
and weight as well as age at the date they were recored. BMI can vary significantly based on 
Scott et al.

 age and gender among individuals. To account for this variation, we used z-scores, which 
convert BMIs into numerical values that represent how many standard deviations an 
individual’s BMI is away from the transformed age- and sex-specific population mean. Z-
scores are employed in World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control growth 
charts. These values are particularly useful when examining extreme percentiles of the 
distribution, such as >99% or <1%. Obesity was defined as a BMI z-score ≥ 2.37 for males 
and ≥ 2.25 for females based on previously published UK population-specific cut-offs. The 
time point of 4 years was selected given the previously described association between 
obesity at this age and obesity in adulthood.
 Variables of interest
Antibiotic exposure was defined as any prescription for a systemic antibiotic occurring from 
enrollment in the practice (no later than 3 months after birth) to 2 years of age. We assessed 
the impact of repeated exposures via number of antibiotic prescriptions (none, 1–2, 3–5, or 
>5 prescriptions). We also assessed timing of the first antibiotic prescription and timing of 
first exposure to antibiotics (0–6 months, 6–12 months, or 12–24 months), as prior research 
had demonstrated a stronger association with exposure in the first year of life. Specific 
classes of antibiotics were categorized as those with antianaerobic coverage (penicillins, 
imidazoles, lincosamides, tetracyclines) and without (cephalosporins, macrolides, sulfa-
containing agents, isoniazid, rifampin, flouroquinolones, aminoglycosides). Systemic 
antifungal agents were assessed as a control.
We assessed those factors previously identified to be associated with obesity as potential 
confounders. These included calendar year, geographic region, mode of delivery, 
socioeconomic status, obesity as an infant, maternal diabetes, and presence of obese family 
members in the household. A multi-step algorithm was employed to identify mothers within 
the THIN database, adapted from previously published methods within the same 
database(see Supplemental Methods and Results). Average maternal BMI was calculated 
from available height and weight data from age 18 to 240 days prior to the child’s birth. A 
multilevel variable was then generated to indicate if the mother had an average BMI greater 
than 30, less than 30, or if we were unable to identify a mother.
Older siblings of the individuals of interest were identified using similar techniques (see 
Supplemental Methods and Results). As siblings, we included male and female individuals 
age ≤ 18 in the same household with complete follow-up during the 4 years of follow-up of 
the index individual’s time within THIN. BMI z-scores were calculated using the same 
criteria as the individuals in our primary cohort of interest. If any siblings met the criteria for 
obesity during the 4-year follow-up period of the individual within our cohort, they were 
categorized as obese. A multilevel categorical variable was then constructed, similar in 
structure to the maternal variable.
For each cohort member, we assessed the presence of obesity during the first year of life. To 
perform this analysis, we identified height and weight data within 14 days of each other 
within 12 months of their date of birth. Obesity was calculated for this infant data by 
calculating Z-Weight for length (zWFL) scores using the World Health Organization growth

 chart, with obesity defined as a Z-score >2 standard deviations above the mean 
(zWFL>1.96).
We assessed several additional factors that may influence the risk of obesity at age 4 years. 
Year of birth was measured to assess the potential influence of trends in obesity over time. 
Postal codes were used to determine if cohort members lived in an urban versus rural 
environment and to compute a Townsend score for socioeconomic status. The Townsend 
score categorizes socioeconomic status on a 5-point scale with 5 representing “most 
deprived”, and is derived from (1) percentage of households without access to a car, (2) 
percentage of households not in owner-occupied accommodations (3) percentage of 
households in overcrowded accommodations, and (4) the percentage of the economically 
active population aged 16–74 who are unemployed (See Supplemental Methods). 
Geographic region was categorized as Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, or England. Mode 
of delivery (caesarean or vaginal) was determined when diagnostic codes were present 
within 6 months after the birthdate of children of interest. In the subset of individuals who 
had codes for both vaginal delivery and caesarean delivery, delivery was categorized as 
caesarean. Maternal diabetes was assessed using diagnostic codes.
 Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). 
BMI z-scores were calculated using the zanthro package. Univariable analyses were 
conducted using logistic regression. We included all potential confounding covariates in a 
fully adjusted model, without employing a predetermined step-wise backwards elimination 
strategy to avoid inappropriate over-fitting or oversimplification. In a sensitivity analysis we 
also generated a more parsimonious model using a backwards elimination stepwise strategy 
to assess the impact on our results (see Supplemental Methods and Results).
 Sensitivity analyses
We performed several sensitivity analyses related to antibiotic exposure. We assessed the 
impact of repeated antibiotic prescriptions, from 0–10 or more prescriptions, as a continuous 
variable in univariable and multivariable analyses. We analyzed the impact of anti-anaerobic 
antibiotics, given their presumed greater impact on the predominantly anaerobic gut 
microbiome, in univariable analyses and in a combined model stratified on whether the 
agents were or were not antianaerobic. We performed a sensitivity examining our 
classification of antibiotics with anaerobic coverage, classifying only those with definite 
anaerobic coverage as anaerobic, and also comparing amoxicillin, which has variable 
anaerobic coverage, to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, which has more complete coverage 
(See Supplemental Methods). We identified households with more than one child within our 
cohort and assessed the impact of antibiotics among these pairs using conditional logistic 
regression. We repeated our primary analyses limited to those individuals with both 
identified mothers and siblings to assess any bias introduced by missing data on obesity 
among family members.
We assessed interaction between the number of prescriptions and age at first prescription 
while avoiding collinearity by combining both age of first antibiotic prescription and number

 of antibiotics over the first 2 years as a 5-level variable: No antibiotics (reference), 1–2 
prescriptions with the first prescription in the first 12 months of life, 3 or greater 
prescriptions with the first prescription in the first 12 months of life, 1–2 prescriptions with 
the first prescription between 12 and 24 months of age, and 3 or greater prescriptions with 
the first prescription between 12 and 24 months of age (See Supplemental methods).
We performed analyses examining the effects of alternate definitions of obesity. For this 
sensitivity analysis, we used a BMI z-score cut-off of ≥3 for obesity at age 4 years. To assess 
the impact of categorizing obesity as a dichotomous variable, we performed linear regression 
to assess the impact of antibiotic exposures on BMI z-score at age 4.
To assess for possible selection bias, we examined the association of antibiotic prescriptions 
and recording of height and weight at age 4. To assess for the potential impact of 
unmeasured confounders, we determined the strength of association between an unmeasured 
confounder and the outcome required to explain our observed association between antibiotic 
exposure and obesity. We modeled our unmeasured confounder after existing data on 
breastfeeding, as we were unable to measure this in our dataset (See Supplemental 
Methods). Breastfeeding is known to be associated with both a lower risk of infection and 
obesity. Approximately 80% of mothers in the UK breast-feed. A recent meta-analyses 
demonstrated that breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of obesity (OR 0.78, 95% 
CI 0.74–0.81). Additionally, prior studies have demonstrated a protective effect of breast-
feeding for respiratory tract infections, with an adjusted OR of 0.65. We also performed an 
analysis examining the potential confounding effect of obesity during the first 6 months of 
life in a cohort of individuals with recorded height and weight in that time period using z-
weight-for-length scores.
This study was considered exempt by the University of Pennsylvania IRB and approved by 
THIN’s scientific review committee.
 Results
Among 533,238 children identified in THIN within 3 months of birth, 253,157 had 4 years 
of follow-up. 21,714 children with complete follow-up for four years met the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria (Figure 1); 64.1% were prescribed antibiotics prior to age 2 years. The 
median time from birth to cohort entry was 37 days (IQR 25–51). 1,306 (6.4%) were obese 
at age 4 years. Obesity at age 4 years was observed in 5.2% of children without antibiotic 
exposure and 6.4% of those with antibiotic exposure, with a risk difference of 1.2% (95% CI 
0.1–1.9%). Baseline characteristics of obese and non-obese children are presented in Table 
1.
Increasing poverty, urban dwelling, year of birth, maternal and sibling obesity, maternal 
diabetes, and obesity in the first year of life were associated with an increased risk of obesity 
at age 4 years (Table 2). The risk of obesity increased with increasing number of courses of 
antibiotics and with antibiotic use in the first year. After adjusting for all covariates, any 
antibiotic prescription (aOR 1.21, [95%CI: 1.07–1.38]) and increasing number of antibiotic 
prescriptions were significantly associated with obesity, specifically for those receiving 3 or

 more prescriptions (1–2 prescriptions: aOR 1.07, [95% CI:0.93–1.23]; 3–5 prescriptions: 
aOR 1.41, [95% CI: 1.20–1.65]; >5 prescriptions: aOR 1.47, [95% CI: 1.19–1.82]). With 
each increase in antibiotic exposure category, there was an increased risk of obesity (p-for-
trend p<0.001). Antibiotic use within the first year was also associated with increased risk: 
(0–6 mos: aOR, 1.33 [95% CI: 1.13–1.57], 6–12 mos: aOR, 1.27, [95% CI: 1.09–1.47]) 
(Table 3). After assessing for interaction between the number of prescriptions and age at first 
exposure, repeated exposures before age 2 had the greatest effect, regardless of whether 
these exposures started before or after 12 months (prior to 12 months: aOR 1.48 [95%CI 
1.27–1.72]; after 12 months: aOR 1.60 [95%CI 1.22–2.10]; Table 5; See Supplemental 
Methods).
Anti-anaerobic antibiotics were associated with obesity in a dose-dependent manner (1–2 
prescriptions: aOR, 1.09, [95% CI: 0.95–1.25]; 3–5 prescriptions: aOR, 1.45 [95% CI: 0.91–
1.68]; >5 prescriptions: aOR, 1.46 [95% CI: 1.09–1.96]), while antibiotics without anti-
anaerobic activity were not (Table 4). Antifungal agents were not associated with obesity 
(OR, 0.81, [95%CI, 0.59 – 1.11]).
When assessing the subgroup of individuals for whom we had identified both mothers and 
siblings (n=3,296), antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased risk of obesity (any 
exposure: OR, 1.73 [95%CI, 1.16 to 2.57]). When examining families with multiple siblings 
with discordant outcomes (n=361), the risk with each antibiotic prescription (aOR, 1.08 
[95%CI, 0.90 to 1.30]) and with number of prescriptions (1–2: aOR, 0.72 [95%CI, 0.43 to 
1.24]; 3–5: aOR, 1.20 [95%CI, 0.65 to 2.21]; >5 aOR, 1.45 [95%CI, 0.54 to 4.06]) was 
similar, though not statistically significant.
 Sensitivity Analyses
Results in a parsimonious model retaining only covariates that were significant in univariate 
analyses yielded similar results to our fully adjusted model (See Supplemental Methods and 
Results). When examining the impact of antibiotic exposures on the BMI z-score at age 4, in 
our fully adjusted model, any antibiotic exposure was associated with a 0.05 point (95% CI: 
0.02–0.09) increase in z-score. Each antibiotic prescription was associated with a 0.014 
point (95% CI:0.01 to 0.02) increase in Z-score. When using z-score ≥ 3 as an alternate 
definition of obesity, 542 children were classified as obese at age 4 years. In this fully 
adjusted model, any antibiotic prescription was associated with an increased risk of obesity 
(aOR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01–1.48). Increasing antibiotic use was also associated with an 
increased risk of obesity (1–2: aOR, 1.06 [95%CI, 0.86–1.32]; 3–5: aOR, 1.47 [95%CI 
1.17–1.86]; >5 aOR, 1.39 [95%CI, 1.01–1.92]).
When using a more stringent definition of antibiotics with anaerobic coverage, there were 
957 individuals exposed to anaerobic antibiotics. Any exposure was associated with an 
increased risk of obesity at age 4, although this was not statistically significant (OR 1.21, 
95%CI: 0.95–1.55). When comparing those who received no antibiotics to those who had 
received amoxicillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, or both, the effect estimates were 
similar for each exposure category (amoxicillin: OR 1.18 [95% CI 1.04–1.34]; amoxicillin 
with clavulanic acid: OR 1.20 [95% CI 0.70–2.09]; both: OR 1.33 [95% CI 0.99–1.80]) (see 
Supplemental Methods and Results).

 Adjusting for documented obesity within the first 6 months of life did not meaningfully alter 
the association between repeated antibiotic use and obesity for those who had received 3 or 
more prescriptions (1–2: aOR, 1.08 [95%CI, 0.93–1.23]; 3–5: aOR, 1.41[95%CI 1.21–1.65]; 
>5 aOR, 1.48[95%CI, 1.19–1.83).
In our analyses of unmeasured confounders and their potential impact on these results, we 
estimate that failure to adjust for breastfeeding only biased our results for any antibiotic 
exposure by approximately 2%, with an externally adjusted odds ratio of 1.22 (See 
Supplemental Methods). If we were to assume that the association between breast-feeding 
and obesity was under-estimated in the meta-analysis by Yan et al and instead use the 
strongest effect estimate included in that analysis (OR 0.29 (95%CI 0.08–1.05), this would 
result in 13% bias, with an externally adjusted OR of 1.10. When considering those with 3 
or more prescriptions for antibiotics, where we observed a greater risk of obesity, the 
adjusted association between obesity 3 or more antibiotic exposures would be 1.27.– Thus, 
within the plausible range of effect estimates, external adjustment for breastfeeding was not 
able to fully explain the association between antibiotic exposure and obesity observed in this 
study.
Receipt of antibiotics was not associated with recording of height and weight among all 
253,137 individuals within THIN who had 4 years of follow-up (OR 1.01, [95%CI 0.98–
1.04]).
 Discussion
With rising rates of childhood obesity worldwide, it is important to identify modifiable 
contributing factors–. Antibiotics are prescribed during an estimated 49 million pediatric 
outpatient visits per year in the United States; the majority are broad-spectrum agents. 
Between 2006–2008, >10 million antibiotic prescriptions were written annually for children 
without clear indication, despite increased awareness of the societal risks of antibiotic 
resistance,. This study identified obesity as one of a growing list of more tangible risks 
associated with antibiotic utilization, including dermatologic, allergic, and infectious 
complications, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune conditions–. Unlike other 
potential risks of antibiotic use, the risk of subsequent obesity is likely easily understandable 
by parents. The results of this study do not imply that antibiotics should not be used when 
indicated, but rather highlight a reason to avoid antibiotics in the absence of well-established 
indications. This may be particularly important if the child has been previously treated with 
antibiotics as the risk of subsequent obesity was greater in those children who had received 3 
or more courses of antibiotics in the first 2 years of life.
These data are supported both in the agriculture industry and in murine models. Moore and 
colleagues first recognized the relationship between streptomycin and weight gain in chick 
models in 1946. Similar results were appreciated in 1949 in experiments where chickens fed 
fishmeal supplemented with cobalamin derived from the bacteria Streptomyces aureofaciens, 
which also produced the antibiotic streptomycin, outgrew chickens receiving fishmeal with a 
liver-derived B12 supplement,. Similar effects have been observed in other livestock with 
differing antibiotics, and the use of these agents rapidly became commonplace in the

 agricultural industry. Several laboratory models have demonstrated that increases in weight 
induced by antibiotics are mediated via the drug’s impact on the microbiome, with no effect 
in germ free models,. This study is one of the first to demonstrate a similar impact in a 
human population, while adjusting for multiple factors previously demonstrated to be 
associated with obesity.
Strengths of the study are the large sample size, near complete capture of lifetime antibiotic 
exposure, and adjustment for multiple factors including both maternal and sibling obesity, 
maternal diabetes, obesity in the first year of life, mode of birth, and socioeconomic status. 
This design allowed us to disentangle the effects of age at first exposure to antibiotics and 
the number of courses, identifying repeated antibiotic exposure as the pivotal factor linking 
antibiotic exposure to childhood obesity. This supports the hypothesis that antibiotics may 
progressively alter the composition and function of the gut microbiome, thereby 
predisposing children to obesity as is seen in livestock and animal models.
There are several potential limitations of this research. We did not measure the indication for 
antibiotic use. However, recent data suggest no causal association between common 
antibiotic indications and obesity. Children who receive multiple antibiotic prescriptions 
may differ from those with none or few in ways that relate to future risks of obesity. 
However, one would expect that in those children with more serious or repeated infections 
between ages 0 and 2, poor weight gain would be more common than excessive weight gain, 
thereby biasing our results towards the null. Employing an outpatient medical record, we 
were unable to capture inpatient medication administration. However, this represents a small 
minority of prescriptions and would also likely bias the results toward the null. Thus, our 
design may have slightly underestimated the association of antibiotic exposure and 
subsequent childhood obesity.
As with any retrospective study, it is possible that selection bias could influence our results. 
While growing children in the UK have routine measurements of their height and weight, 
these measurements are typically recorded via a paper record known as the Personal Child 
Health Record as opposed to in the EMR. Inclusion in the EMR, and subsequently THIN, is 
at the discretion of the treating physician. Therefore, it is possible that selective recording of 
this information could influence our findings. However, when examining overall obesity 
rates in the United Kingdom, observed rates within THIN were only slightly lower than 
those previously published for the UK, and demonstrated similar temporal trends within our 
cohort (data not shown). For selection bias to have influenced the results of this study, 
recording of height and weight data would have to be associated with both obesity and 
receipt of antibiotics. As we observed no association between receipt of antibiotics and 
recording of height and weight in the overall cohort, selection bias is unlikely to explain the 
observed associations.
Despite adjusting for many potential confounders associated with obesity, there are a few 
potential confounders that we were not able to adjust for, including breast feeding, physical 
activity, and sleep,,. However, it is unlikely that these factors fully explain the association 
between obesity and antibiotic exposure appreciated within our data given the results of the 
analyses of unmeasured confounders. The sensitivity analysis using external adjustment

 demonstrated that our estimate was robust to unmeasured confounders, even if they were 
strongly protective against future obesity. Furthermore, recent survey data demonstrate that 
mode of feeding does not usually differ within households, and we appreciated similar 
effects of repeated antibiotic exposure among sibling pairs discordant for obesity. Although 
we were able to identify family members in order to adjust for environmental and genetic 
confounders, we were underpowered to perform a similar analysis examining only multiple 
births (i.e. twins or triplets), as obesity status and antibiotic exposure were nearly identical 
between these individuals. We also excluded children with asthma or reactive airway disease 
from our analyses, given the known association between these conditions and obesity and 
the potential for confounding due to glucocorticoid exposure.. Therefore, one should use 
caution when interpreting the impact of our results in these populations. Further research is 
required to assess the durability of this response later into adolescence and young adulthood 
as well as later onset obesity.
Lastly, it is possible that our analyses examining antibiotic spectrum coverage could be 
underpowered and subject to misclassification bias. We appreciated an association between 
obesity and anti-anaerobic agents, with a dose-dependent response. As the majority of 
antibiotics prescribed were anti-anaerobic in our primary analyses, it is possible that the lack 
of association with the use of antibiotics without anti-anaerobic coverage was due in part to 
smaller numbers. In our sensitivity analysis, amoxicillin, an agent with minimal anti-
anaerobic activity was significantly associated with obesity with an odds ratio comparable to 
that for amoxicillin with clavulanic acid. While our analysis of amoxicillin with clavulanic 
acid did not reach statistical significance, this may be due to limited numbers of individuals 
with this exposure in comparison to amoxicillin alone (see Supplemental Methods and 
results). As such, repeated courses of antibiotic exposure may be a more important risk 
factor than spectrum of activity. Further research is required to determine if specific classes 
of antibiotics are more strongly associated with subsequent obesity.
In summary, we have demonstrated that exposure to antibiotics in the first two years of life 
is associated with an approximately 1.2% absolute and 25% relative increase in the risk of 
early childhood obesity. This relationship is strongest when considering repeat exposures, 
particularly with 3 or more courses. While early antibiotic use has been associated with a 
number of rare long-term health consequences, these data link antibiotics to one of the most 
important and growing public health problems worldwide.

Impact of any antibiotic exposure and antibiotic exposure when stratified by anaerobic coverage. Exposure was assessed as any exposure, a continuous exposure with increasing antibiotic prescriptions, and 
as a categorical variable.
aMultivariable models included year of birth, maternal and sibling obesity, maternal diabetes, mode of delivery, country of origin, urban environment, and Townsend score.

Multivariable model assessing the association of obesity at age 4 with time of first antibiotic exposure and number of exposures as a combined 
single interaction variable, adjusted for Townsend quintile (poverty scale), sibling and maternal obesity, and birth before or after 2000. In this 
model, there is a strong association between exposure to 3 or more antibiotics, regardless of first exposure before or after 12 months of age.
