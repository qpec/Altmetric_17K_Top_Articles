Background: This study investigates the causal relationships between reading and print exposure and investigates
whether the amount children read outside school determines how well they read, or vice versa. Previous findings from
behavioural studies suggest that reading predicts print exposure. Here, we use twin-data and apply the behaviour-
genetic approach of direction of causality modelling, suggested by Heath et al. (1993), to investigate the causal
relationships between these two traits. Method: Partial data were available for a large sample of twin children
(N = 11,559) and 262 siblings, all enrolled in the Netherlands Twin Register. Children were assessed around
7.5 years of age. Mothers completed questionnaires reporting children’s time spent on reading activities and reading
ability. Additional information on reading ability was available through teacher ratings and performance on national
reading tests. For siblings reading test, results were available. Results: The reading ability of the twins was
comparable to that of the siblings and national norms, showing that twin findings can be generalized to the
population. A measurement model was specified with two latent variables, Reading Ability and Print Exposure, which
correlated .41. Heritability analyses showed that Reading Ability was highly heritable, while genetic and
environmental influences were equally important for Print Exposure. We exploited the fact that the two constructs
differ in genetic architecture and fitted direction of causality models. The results supported a causal relationship
running from Reading Ability to Print Exposure. Conclusions: How much and how well children read are moderately
correlated. Individual differences in print exposure are less heritable than individual differences in reading ability.
Importantly, the present results suggest that it is the children’s reading ability that determines how much they
choose to read, rather than vice versa. Keywords: Direction of causality models; reading skills; print exposure; twin
studies; causal modelling; behaviour-genetics.
Introduction
Learning
to
read
builds
on
language
skills,
it
requires instruction and it also requires practice.
Cunningham and Stanovich (1997) were the first to
formally propose that practice, or ‘print exposure’ is
a vital ingredient in the development of fluent
reading. However, there are vast individual differ-
ences in children’s reading habits. It has been
estimated that, whereas avid readers read as many
as 1.8 million words per year, reluctant readers read
only about 8,000 words for their own enjoyment
(Anderson, Wilson, & Fielding, 1988; table 3). Mea-
sured longitudinally, the link between how much
and how well a child reads holds over a 10-year time
period (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997). Measured
concurrently, the link is consistently present from
preschool, when the frequency of shared-reading
correlates with emergent literacy skills, to university,
when the amount of independent reading correlates
with word-level reading skills, reading comprehen-
sion and vocabulary size (Mol & Bus, 2011). For
decoding or word-level reading, the focus of the
current paper, the concurrent correlation during the
school years is estimated at .38 (Mol & Bus, 2011).
The amount of time children read out-of-school
hours has been variously termed reading amount,
reading frequency, reading for pleasure, indepen-
dent reading and print exposure. Measured here is
the quantity of reading that parents state their
children do of their own volition and not as pre-
scribed by school. We use the term ‘print exposure’
here but, by adopting this term, we do not assume
that a child’s print exposure is the outcome of a
passive process. Indeed, a key issue is the causal
direction of the link (or links) between reading skill
and print exposure: do children who read more
become better readers (print exposure ? reading), do
poorer readers avoid reading (reading ? print expo-
sure) or is there a reciprocal relationship between
reading and print exposure?
To date, three studies have used a longitudinal
design to investigate the relationships between read-
ing and print exposure. Aarnoutse and van Leeuwe
(1998) tracked the development of children’s print
exposure and reading comprehension from the sec-
ond to sixth grades. Print exposure developed largely
independent of reading comprehension, with mar-
ginal influences of reading comprehension on print
exposure. Over a shorter time scale, Lepp€
anen,
Aunola, and Nurmi (2005) assessed print exposure
and reading ability (accuracy, fluency and compre-
hension) between Grades 1 and 2 in a cross-lagged
design. Causal relationships were primarily from

 reading skills to print exposure, though there was a
small effect of print exposure on reading accuracy.
Finally,
Harlaar,
Deater-Deckard,
Thompson,
DeThorne, and Petrill (2011) measured print expo-
sure and reading skill (i.e. a composite of accuracy
and comprehension) between the ages of 10 and
11 years. The effect again ran from reading skill to
print exposure. However, interpretation of the find-
ings from these studies is hampered by the strong
stability of reading ability over time, for example,
Harlaar et al. (2011) report an autoregressive effect
of .90. Given the large autoregressive effect of earlier
reading on later reading ability, there is little vari-
ance remaining for any other variable to explain. It
follows that understanding any putative impact of
print exposure on reading (or a reciprocal relation-
ship) calls for an alternative design.
An important hypothesis regarding the relation-
ship between reading ability and print exposure is
that it reflects shared genetic influences. Further, on
the grounds of temporal precedence, it might be
assumed that reading mediates genetic influences
on print exposure. While it is well established that
differences among children in reading skills are
largely due to genetic factors (Olson, Keenan, Byrne,
& Samuelsson, 2014), with heritability across stud-
ies reported to be .73 (de Zeeuw, de Geus, &
Boomsma, 2015), few studies have investigated the
aetiology of individual differences in print exposure.
Those that have report heritability estimates ranging
from 0.10 (Harlaar, Dale, & Plomin, 2007) through
0.39 (Harlaar, Trzaskowski, Dale, & Plomin, 2014) to
0.65–0.67 (Harlaar et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2009),
all with large E-components, suggestive of substan-
tive measurement error.
Arguably, the typically lower heritability estimates
for print exposure than reading are to be expected
given that print exposure depends on the presence of
printed material in the child’s environment. Turning
to estimates of the genetic correlation between read-
ing and print exposure; these are about .60 (Harlaar
et al., 2011, 2014; Martin et al., 2009). However,
since a genetic correlation may be due to genetic
effects on both traits (pleiotropy), such estimates
cannot speak to the causal relationship between two
traits (here reading and print exposure). Alterna-
tively, in a causal model, genetic effects on the
causal phenotype are transmitted through a direct
relationship with the outcome phenotype, hence
giving rise to a genetic correlation between the
phenotypes (e.g. genes ? reading ? print exposure).
Adesignthatcanspeaktothedirectionofcausalityis
the behaviour-genetic ‘direction of causality’ model
(Duffy & Martin, 1994; Heath et al., 1993). This design
requires cross-sectional data on family members, such
as twin pairs, and, therefore, does not depend on
longitudinal data so that the stability of traits is not an
issue. Denoting the phenotypes X and Y, competing
models are tested which explain the X-Y correlation as
resulting from either (a) a common genetic factor, (b) a
common underlying environmental cause, (c) both 1
and 2, (d) X influencing Y at the phenotypic (i.e.
behavioural) level, (e) Y influencing X, or (f) both 4
and 5 (i.e. reciprocal phenotypic influences). Twin data
allow the investigation of causality because the differ-
ent models give rise to different expectations for the
cross-trait cross-twin correlation (i.e. the correlation
between X in twins with Y in the co-twin). Competing
models can be distinguished best if the correlation
between traits is reasonably large (i.e. >.25, Duffy &
Martin, 1994), the traits differ in the relative impor-
tance of genetic and environmental influences, and
measurement error is accounted for by using multiple
indicators of the phenotypes (Heath et al., 1993). This
model has been applied successfully to address
causality (e.g. Ebejer et al., 2010; Gillespie, Zhu,
Neale, Heath, & Martin, 2003; Thomsen et al., 2009;
Toulopoulou et al., 2015).
In the current study, we apply direction of causal-
ity models to infer the causal relations (if any)
between reading ability and print exposure in a large
sample (N > 11,000) of 7-year-olds. Given the robust
association between our traits of interest, the larger
impact of environmental differences on print expo-
sure than on reading ability, and the use of latent
variables to account for measurement error, direc-
tion of causality modelling should work well.
Methods
Participants
The present project was approved by the medical ethical
committee of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (NTR/25-05-
2007). Analyses were based on 11,559 twins, born between
1994 and 2004, and 262 siblings. The sample was obtained
from the Netherlands Twin Register, a nationwide database of
multiple births and their family members, including data from
birth onwards (van Beijsterveldt et al., 2013). For present
purposes, we employed data from school achievement records
and from questionnaires, which mothers and teachers com-
pleted when the children were 7½ years old. Having obtained
parental consent, we approached teachers to complete the
questionnaire and provide test scores from the achievement
records (national pupil monitoring system (Cito, 2014)).
In total, 368 (3.1%) twin children were excluded, and 11,559
were retained for analyses (Appendix S1). Each of the 11,559
children provided at least one data point. These 11,559 twins
(of whom 5,723 were boys) came from 6,072 twin pairs: 2,175
MZ twin pairs (1,034 male; 1,141 female) and 3,897 DZ twin
pairs (1,021 male; 939 female; 1,937 opposite sex). Zygosity of
same sex twin pairs was determined using DNA polymor-
phisms (in 10.0%) or using a parent-report zygosity question-
naire comprising 10 items on twin similarity, with an accuracy
of 93% (Rietveld et al., 2000). Mothers and teachers completed
the questionnaire including items on reading when the chil-
dren were on average 7.50 (SD 0.33) and 7.44 (SD 0.36) years
old, respectively. For neither informant were the item scores
systematically related to age (�.05 < rs < .05). Teachers com-
pleted the questionnaires at the end of the school year: most
children attended Grade 1 (69%) or 2 (26%). The proportion of
twins who were in the same classroom (and rated by the same
teacher) and the proportion of twins who were in different
classrooms (rated by different teachers) did not differ signifi-
cantly by zygosity (see Appendix S1).

 Teachers also provided test scores for reading ability of 262
siblings of the twins from achievement records. These additional
data enabled us to examine how representative the twin sample
was of nontwin children. When there were multiple siblings, we
selected the data of the oldest sibling (n = 262; 127 boys).
Measures
The current study employed school achievement records and
data from questionnaires that were mailed or offered online to
mothers and teachers. Print exposure was based on maternal
ratings and reading ability was based on maternal and teacher
ratings and achievement records.
Reading ability.
We used five indicators of reading ability:
one item from the mother questionnaire, two from the teacher
questionnaire and two test scores. Mothers were asked to report
the current school grade for Dutch language [scale points: 1 (fail),
2 (poor), 3 (satisfactory), 4 (good) and 5 (excellent)]. Teachers were
asked the child’s usual grades for reading [scale points: 1 (fail), 2
(poor), 3 (satisfactory), 4 (above average) and 5 (good/excellent)]
and from the Conners’ Teacher Rating Scales (Conners, Sitare-
nios, Parker, & Epstein, 1998) whether the child lagged behind in
reading[scalepoints: 1 (not trueatall), 2 (justa littletrue),3 (pretty
much true), to 4 (very much true)].
Reading ability was tested at school with a word-reading
fluency list (Verhoeven, 1995; List 3) given by the teacher to
children individually. The list, which is part of the Dutch pupil
monitoring system, comprises 120 polysyllabic words varying
in orthographic complexity (Verhoeven & van Leeuwe, 2009).
Children were asked to read aloud as many words as possible
within one minute in mid-Grade 2 and mid-Grade 3. These test
scores correlated .86 (Table 1).
Print exposure.
The two indicators of print exposure came
from the mothers’ questionnaire. Mothers were asked ‘How many
books (no comics) does the child read per week?’ [scale points: 1
(none), 2 (one or two), 3 (three or four) and 4 (more than four)], and
‘How much time does the twin spend on the following activities?’
for which one of the listed activities was ‘reading books’ [scale
points: 1 (every day), 2 (almost every day), 3 (a couple of days per
week),4(onceaweek),5(lessthanonceaweek),6(sofaronce)and
7 (never)]. As an index of reliability we also calculated how much
time children spend on reading books compared with the other
activities that were listed (e.g. gaming, watching TV, playing with
friends). This relative measure correlated .92 with the raw item.
Results
Sample representativeness
We assessed two indicators of how representative
our sample is based on how well the twins in the
sample read. First, we compared the reading test
scores of the twins to those of their siblings. As
shown online in Table S1, the means did not differ
significantly (Cohen’s ds �0.02). Second, the test
manual reports the following mean scores (i.e. cut-
offs between below and above average, or C and B
levels) for second to fifth grades: 39.5, 59.5, 71.5 and
81.5. Our twin sample means are ~0.18 SD above
these population means. So, good reading families
are somewhat overrepresented, but within families,
twins are representative of singletons. Further anal-
yses are based on the twin data.
Descriptive statistics
Some items were reverse scored so higher scores
reflect better and more reading. Data from some
questionnaire items relating to reading ability were
negatively skewed (Table 2), that is, less sensitive in
discriminating among good readers. Nevertheless,
the correlations between the questionnaire items
and the test scores were between .54 and .74
(Table 1). The distributions of the two test scores
were approximately normal. Intercorrelations among
reading ability indicators were between .54 and 86.
The two print exposure indicators correlated .51.
Correlations among ability and exposure items were
low (.15–.31). The association between reading abil-
ity and print exposure is visualized in Figure 1.
Missing data.
Out of seven possible data points,
children
had

points
(SD = 1.43). See Appendix S1 for details. We under-
took missing value analyses to examine whether
missingness of data was related to mother’s educa-
tional level or children’s reading ability (Tables S2
and S3). We did not run these analyses for print
exposure, because we only had data from one infor-
mant. These analyses found missingness to be
unrelated to the dependent variable reading ability;
coupled with the fact that the data set is very large,
the missing data do not, therefore, pose major issues.
The structural equation modelling described below
was performed in Mplus (Muth�
en & Muth�
en, 1998-
2015). Mplus handles missing data by fitting the
model using robust raw-data maximum-likelihood

 estimation on the assumption that data are missing
at random.
Analytical approach.
Three sets of models were
fitted, each set of models building on the previous
set. The first set is based on a two-factor phenotypic
measurement model (Figure 2). The model formed
the basis for the behavioural-genetic model (Fig-
ures 3 and 4), which in turn formed the starting
point for the causal models (Figure 5).
First, we fitted phenotypic two-factor (measure-
ment) models to the data set. To account for depen-
dency among the observations (twins clustered in
pairs), we corrected standard errors and model fit
statistics as proposed by Rebollo, de Moor, Dolan,
and Boomsma (2006). The final measurement model
formed the basis of subsequent behavioural-genetic
modelling.
After establishing the measurement model, we
investigated the relative contribution of genes and
environment
on
the
phenotypic
variances
and
covariance of reading ability and print exposure.
The twin method exploits data on MZ and DZ twin
pairs
who
are
raised
together.
MZ
twins
are
genetically identical, DZ twin share on average 50%
of their segregating genes. We decomposed the total
trait variance into an additive-genetic variance com-
ponent (A), a common environmental variance com-
ponent,
reflecting
the
effect
of
environmental
influences that the twins share (shared or common
environment: C), and an unshared-environmental
variance component, which reflects unshared envi-
ronmental influences (nonshared environment: E).
The phenotypic twin correlations are diagnostic of
the underlying model. Genetic influences are impli-
cated if the MZ twin correlation is larger than the DZ
correlation.
We specified for Twin 1 and Twin 2 members the

fluency test were included in this figure. If both Grades 2 and 3
scores were available, the first was taken. Some answer cate-
gories were collapsed to simplify the figure. Dyslexic is defined as
scoring <10th percentile, normal as 10th–75th percentile, and
good as >75th, according to national norms [Colour figure can be

Next,
we
tested
the
basic
twin-model
assumption of equal means and variances over twin
members and over zygosities. This more restricted
model, labelled the phenotypic twin model, formed
the basis of the ACE models, in which the variances
of the latent factors were decomposed into A, C
and E.
Modelling results
Measurement model.
A model with two common
factors representing Reading Ability and Print Expo-
sure fitted the data reasonably well: v2(df = 13,
N = 11,559) = 743.91,
p < .001;
RMSEA = 0.070
(0.066–0.074); CFI = 0.931. Based on the inspection
of modification
indices (which
indicate
possible
sources of misspecification), we allowed the residu-
als of the two teacher items to covary, and the
residuals of the two reading tests to covary. This
revised model fitted significantly better than the
previous
one:
Dv2(df = 2) = 705.08,
p < .001.
It
showed excellent overall fit: v2(df = 11, N = 11,559) =
38.83,
p < .001;
RMSEA = 0.015,
(0.010–0.020);
CFI = 0.997. We used this revised model as our
measurement model (Figure 2).
Behavioural-genetic models.
Mean differences in
item scores between boys and girls were accounted
for by regressing all items on sex, coded 0 (boys) or 1
(girls). On average, girls were rated as reading more
(bs .12–.15, ps < .001) and slightly better than boys
(bs .07–.09, ps < .001). However, on average, boys
and girls scored similarly on the reading tests (bs
.02, ps > .33). We subsequently applied an omnibus
test of basic assumptions of the twin model concern-
ing equal means and variances. This yielded Dv2
statistic of 171.6 (df = 46; p < .01) and an increase
in AIC of 79.64. As inspection of the results revealed
no evident misfit, we attribute the significance and
the increase in AIC to the power afforded by the large
sample size (i.e. the number of twin pairs is 6,072).
We note that the BIC, which compared to AIC favours
more parsimonious models, decreased by 229.08.
Twin correlations are reported in Table 3.
Subsequently, we carried out the decomposition of
the phenotypic variances into the A, C and E
variance components. We did not consider sex
differences in heritability. Previous work on reading
ability (de Zeeuw, van Beijsterveldt, Glasner, de
Geus, & Boomsma, 2016) and the current twin
correlations suggest that the A, C and E variance
components do not differ between boys and girls.
Residual variances of the items were also decom-
posed. As, the C components of the residual vari-
ances (except the one from the last indicator) were all
close to zero, these were set to zero. To reflect the
correlation between the residuals of the two teacher

 items and the correlation between the residuals of
the two test items, correlation between their respec-
tive As and Es were added. This bivariate ACE model
is depicted in Figure 3. The contribution of C to the
variance in Reading Ability was estimated at only 1%
and was not significant (p = .120). As a consequence,
the correlation between the C factors of reading
ability and print exposure could not be estimated
reliably. Therefore, we dropped both paths (Dv2-test:
Dv2(df = 2, N = 6,072 pairs) = 9.37, p = .001), result-
ing in the model depicted in Figure 4.
We then tested the four causal models depicted in
Figure 5. To get from the correlational model in
Figure 4 to the bidirectional model in Figure 5 (top
left), two correlations were dropped and two causal
paths were added, resulting in a model with the
Figure 5 Direction of causality models. In the interest of space, only the top part of the three models on the left-hand side is shown. In
the bidirectional model (top left), the �.06 path is not significant (p = .254). The middle left one has a very poor fit. In the bottom left
one, the rA-path of .02 has a p-value of .031. The one on the right-hand side is the one that is parsimonious and supported by the data

 same number of degrees of freedom. The v2, AIC and
BIC went up by 3.88, indicating only slightly poorer
fit than the correlational model. The path from
Reading Ability to Print Exposure was substantial
and
dropping
this
path
(Figure 5,

resulted in a large deterioration in fit: Dv2(df = 1,
N = 6,072 pairs) = 152.02, p < .001, DAIC = 150.02,
DBIC = 143.31. However, the path from Print Expo-
sure to Reading Ability in the bidirectional model
was not significant (p = .254) and could be dropped
(Figure 5 right): Dv2(df = 1, N = 6,072 pairs) = 1.35,
p = .246, DAIC = �0.65, DBIC = �7.37. Finally, we
tested the model in which the association between
Reading Ability and Print Exposure was modelled as
both a direct effect (flowing from Reading Ability to
Print Exposure) and common genetic influences. We
opted for adding a shared genetic effect (i.e. rA),
rather than a shared nonshared environmental effect
(i.e. rE) because rE hardly contributes to the pheno-
typic association (estimated at only 4%). The fit of
this final model (Figure 5, bottom left) was exactly
the same as the correlational model in Figure 4. The
rA was just .02, so could be left out. To conclude, the
unidirectional causal model ‘reading ability ? print
exposure’ is both parsimonious and supported by
the data.
Discussion
The present study applied direction of causation
modelling (Duffy & Martin, 1994; Heath et al., 1993)
to a large twin dataset to assess the relationships
between reading ability and print exposure. We
found evidence for a causal influence of reading
ability on print exposure, consistent with previous
findings from behavioural studies (Aarnoutse & van
Leeuwe, 1998; Harlaar et al., 2011; Lepp€
anen et al.,
2005). Our findings refute the common belief that
there is an influence of print exposure on reading
ability,
or
that
there
are
reciprocal
influences
between them. Interestingly, according to a Twitter
poll, only 6% of people responding thought that
reading ability ? print exposure (van Bergen, 2017).
The finding that reading ability is the driver of
print exposure does not, of course, imply that
exposure to print and thus exposure to orthographic
forms is irrelevant to learning to read. To become a
skilled reader, it is undoubtedly important to develop
detailed lexical representations of words (Nation,
2017; Perfetti, 2007). However, while this may take
as little as a single exposure in some readers
(Tamura, Castles, & Nation, 2017), in poor readers,
it takes much longer to consolidate new learning
(Share & Shalev, 2004). Moreover, although a fair
assumption is that schools provide the necessary
practice, measures of print exposure on which good
and poor readers differ, tap reading outside of school
hours. We demonstrate here that whether children
choose to read for themselves depends, in part, on
their reading ability, underlining the fact that poor
readers choose to read less. In fact, we found that
reading ability accounted for 16% of the variance in
print exposure. In addition, other influences, both
genetic and shared environmental, are also at play.
According to the unexplained variance in the
model, additional genetic factors that influence the
amount children read are independent of those
influencing reading skills. We speculate that they
may include inherited factors associated with ADHD
symptomatology, such that more restless children
are less likely to sit down and read than those with
good attentional control. Likewise, we believe that
the shared-environmental component may partly
reflect the values of parents, the supply of books at
home and the importance school places on book
reading outside of the classroom curriculum. Our
findings also highlight that print exposure is not
something imposed upon the child. Rather the fact
that it depends on environmental stimulation (or the
absence thereof) and on innate child factors suggests
that
gene–environment
correlation
is
important,
both passive, evocative and active gene–environment
(g-e) correlation (Plomin, DeFries, & Loehlin, 1977;
van Bergen, van der Leij, & de Jong, 2014).
An objection to the present conclusion is that we only
measured reading at one point in time, during the early
stages of reading acquisition (1 year after the com-
mencement of reading instruction in the Netherlands).
Moreover, the data cannot speak to how the home
literacy environment might influence, not only chil-
dren’s reading development (Hamilton, Hayiou-Tho-
mas, Hulme, & Snowling, 2016; S�
en�
echal & LeFevre,
2002), but also their motivation to read. However, we
argue that, given the stability of reading over time, it is
unlikely that later levels of print exposure could
account for future growth in reading, or override the
powerful g-e correlation that manifest itself in dyslexic
readers choosing literary activities less. We contend,
nonetheless, that longitudinal data are required to
validate these assumptions. We also acknowledge
weaknesses in the measure of print exposure used. In
the light of the increased use of screen time, e-readers
and other technologies, the use of parent’s ratings of
how many books children read outside of school may
be questioned as a way of measuring print exposure.
On the other hand, studies have shown that print
exposure from digital sources (like email, Wikipedia,
Facebook) is unrelated or only weakly related to
reading ability (McGeown, Osborne, Warhurst, Nor-
gate, & Duncan, 2016; Pfost, D€
orfler, & Artelt, 2013).
In studying causality, both observational and
intervention studies are important, but they address
different questions. We observed children’s reading
skills and reading habits and investigated their
origins in natural settings. Observational research
like this addresses the ‘what is’ question. In contrast,
intervention studies address the ‘what could be’
question (Plomin, Shakeshaft, McMillan, & Trza-
skowski, 2014). By studying causality in the natural
situation,

The causal influence of reading ability on print exposure
1211
 drives print exposure. Ultimately, it is perhaps not
surprising that in natural settings poorer readers
choose to read less in their spare time. Intervention
studies cannot demonstrate causal processes in the
natural situation, and conversely, an observational
study like the current one cannot say what effects
could be achieved by intervention. For instance, our
study does not rule out potential benefits of getting
children to read more than they would normally
choose to. Likewise, a successful reading interven-
tion may well result in poor readers wanting to read
more, and gains in reading skill may mediate an
increase in print exposure. To our knowledge, no
such controlled trial has been conducted. More
generally, it is known that successful reading inter-
ventions
use
evidenced-based
programmes
with
individualized
instruction
and
may
need
to
be
offered for up to several years to produce lasting
effects (McDonald Connor et al., 2013; Regtvoort,
Zijlstra, & van der Leij, 2013). There is also evidence
that interventions that focus on phonological aware-
ness and alphabetic skills do not improve reading
outcomes unless emergent phonological skills are
practised in the context of reading texts or books
(Hatcher, Hulme, & Ellis, 1994; Wise, Ring, & Olson,
2000). If true, even though print exposure does not
causally influence reading as measured in this
study,
moving
children
beyond
their
‘natural’
amount of reading may be a sensible target of
intervention, alongside improving decoding skills.
By using direction of causality modelling, we
extend what is known about the context in which
children’s reading skills develop. We show that it is a
useful technique for understanding individual dif-
ferences in reading attainment and the factors which
determine the enjoyment (or dislike) of reading. We
endorse previous findings of a genetic influence on
word-level reading and extend this to show that the
same genetic factors influence print exposure cau-
satively and this, in turn, depends on additional
genetic and environmental factors.
Conclusions
We dissected the association between 7½-year-old
children’s reading ability and reading frequency and
volume (called print exposure). We confirmed that
individual differences in reading ability were mostly
due to genetic differences, while print exposure was
equally
genetic
and
environmental
in
origin.
Importantly, we found evidence that children’s read-
ing level fuels how much they choose to read – it
follows, as practitioners know, that children tend to
avoid reading if they find it difficult. Interventions
should focus not only on promoting reading skills
but also motivation to read.

Key points
• Dyslexic readers typically have low levels of print exposure.
• It cannot be said that poor reading is due to limited reading exposure.
• Individual differences in reading ability are mostly due to genetic differences, whereas individual differences
in print exposure have equal genetic and environmental origins.
• Individual differences in reading ability predict print exposure, rather than vice versa.

 • Practitioners should not take this to mean that interventions to promote print exposure cannot improve
reading skills.
• Encouraging children to read more is of itself a sensible target.
