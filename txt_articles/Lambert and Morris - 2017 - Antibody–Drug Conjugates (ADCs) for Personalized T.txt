ABSTRACT
Attaching a cytotoxic ‘‘payload’’ to an antibody
to form an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC)
provides a mechanism for selective delivery of
the cytotoxic agent to cancer cells via the
specific binding of the antibody to cancer-se-
lective cell surface molecules. The first ADC to
receive
marketing
authorization
was
gem-
tuzumab
ozogamicin,
which
comprises
an
anti-CD33 antibody conjugated to a highly
potent DNA-targeting antibiotic, calicheamicin,
approved in 2000 for treating acute myeloid
leukemia. It was withdrawn from the US market
in 2010 following an unsuccessful confirmatory
trial. The development of two classes of highly
potent
microtubule-disrupting
agents,
may-
tansinoids and auristatins, as payloads for ADCs
resulted in approval of brentuximab vedotin in
2011
for
treating
Hodgkin
lymphoma
and
anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and approval of
ado-trastuzumab emtansine in 2013 for treating
HER2-positive
breast
cancer.
Their
success
stimulated
much
research
into
the
ADC
approach, with [
60 ADCs currently in clinical
evaluation, mostly targeting solid tumors. Five
ADCs have advanced into pivotal clinical trials
for treating various solid tumors—platinum-re-
sistant
ovarian
cancer,
mesothelioma,
triple-negative breast cancer, glioblastoma, and
small cell lung cancer. The level of target
expression is a key parameter in predicting the
likelihood of patient benefit for all these ADCs,
as well as for the approved compound, ado-
trastuzumab emtansine. The development of a
patient
selection
strategy
linked
to
target
expression
on
the
tumor
is
thus
critically
important
for
identifying
the
population
appropriate for receiving treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Chemotherapy with cytotoxic compounds has
been the mainstay of systemic cancer treatment
for half a century [1, 2]. Over many years, ‘‘op-

combinations
of
different
cytotoxic
agents having different cell-killing mechanisms
were developed to maximize the antitumor
activity
[2].
However,
these treatments

 result long-term remissions are rarely seen in
patients
with
metastatic
disease.
Medicinal
chemists and oncologists have long sought
ways
to increase the delivery
of cytotoxic
chemicals to cancer cells for increased efficacy,
while minimizing exposure of normal healthy
tissue [3]. The invention of monoclonal anti-
bodies [4] offered the possibility of exploiting
their specific binding properties as a mechanism
for the selective delivery of a cytotoxic agent to
cancer cells upon chemical conjugation of a
cytotoxic effector to a tumor-binding antibody
to create an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC).
This article is a review based on previously
conducted studies and does not involve any
new studies of human or animal subjects per-
formed by either of the authors.
THE KEY COMPONENTS
OF AN ADC
All three component parts of an ADC, the
antibody, the cytotoxic agent, and the linker
that joins them, are critical elements in its
design. The antibody moiety should be specific
for a cell surface target molecule that is selec-
tively expressed on cancer cells, or overex-
pressed on cancer cells relative to normal cells
[5]. The payload of an ADC must be highly
cytotoxic so that it can kill tumor cells at the
intracellular concentrations achievable follow-
ing distribution of the ADC into solid tumor
tissue, and because only a limited number of
payloads can be linked to an antibody molecule
(typically an average of 3–4 payloads per anti-
body) without severely compromising its bio-
physical and pharmacokinetic properties [5–7].
Indeed, the breakthrough in ADC research that
eventually led to the creation of approved and
marketed products came with the realization
that the cytotoxic agents suitable for ADC
approaches need to have potency in the pico-
molar range to be able to be delivered in suffi-
cient quantity to enough cancer cells to effect a
therapeutic benefit [5–7]. The cytotoxic com-
pounds used in approved and marketed ADCs
are derivatives of calicheamicin, a class of
highly cytotoxic enediyne antibiotics which kill
cells by causing DNA double-strand breaks
[5, 8], and derivatives of the potent antimitotic
microtubule-disrupting agents, dolastatin 10
(auristatins) [6, 9] and maytansine [7, 10, 11],
the chemical structures of which are shown in
Fig. 1a. The two tubulin-acting agents were
evaluated in phase I and phase II clinical trials
and showed minimal activity at their recom-
mended phase II doses of 2.0 mg/m2 (may-
tansine) and 0.4 mg/m2 (dolastatin 10) when
each was given once every 3 weeks [12–15].
Gastrointestinal and central neurologic toxici-
ties were dose-limiting for maytansine [12, 13],
while myelosuppression was dose-limiting for
dolastatin 10 [14, 15].
The third vital component of an ADC is the
linker
that
forms
a
chemical
connection
between the payload and the antibody. The
linker should be sufficiently stable in circulation
to allow the payload to remain attached to the
antibody while in circulation as it distributes
into tissues (including solid tumor tissue), yet
should
allow
efficient
release
of
an
active
cell-killing agent once the ADC is taken up into
the cancer cells [5]. Linkers can be characterized
as either cleavable, where a chemical bond (or
bonds) between the payload and the attach-
ment site on the antibody (usually an amino
acid) can be cleaved intracellularly [16–18], or
as
non-cleavable,
where
the
final
active
metabolite released within the cell includes the
payload and all elements of the linker still
attached to an amino acid residue of the anti-
body, typically a lysine or a cysteine residue,
following complete proteolytic degradation of
the ADC within the lysosome of the cell
[19–21].
The design goal for an ADC is to harness the
potent tumor cell-killing action of the payload
to an antibody, while retaining the favorable
in vivo pharmacokinetic and biodistribution
properties of the immunoglobulin, as well as
any intrinsic biologic or immunologic activity it
may have [5–7, 21, 22]. Much of the selection of
the optimal antibody, the ideal linker–payload
chemistry, and the optimal number of payload
molecules linked per antibody molecule, are
determined empirically, with a focus on maxi-
mizing the therapeutic index of the ADC [5, 22].

preclinical evaluation leading to the selection of

 the ADC design that became ado-trastuzumab
emtansine (T-DM1), the first ADC to receive full
approval for a solid tumor indication (vide
infra), has been reviewed elsewhere [7], and
serves as an exemplar for the work involved in
ADC optimization prior to declaring a candi-
date for clinical evaluation.
THE FIRST ADC APPROVALS WERE
FOR TREATING HEMATOLOGIC
MALIGNANCIES
The first ADC therapeutics to reach the market
were developed in hematologic malignancies,
where target antigens are generally well-char-
acterized, lineage-specific cell surface molecules
that are uniformly expressed and thought to be
more accessible to antibodies circulating in
plasma,
relative
to
those
present
on
solid
tumors [22]. Such antigens are usually highly
restricted in their distribution, meaning that
healthy non-hematopoietic tissue and pluripo-
tent hematopoietic stem cells are not targeted
by the ADC. The first ADC to receive marketing
approval from the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) was gemtuzumab ozogamicin
(Mylotarg�), an ADC created by conjugation of
calicheamicin to an anti-CD33 antibody via an
acid–labile linkage [23, 24]. CD33 is a marker of
normal and malignant cells of the myeloid lin-
eage. Based on a single arm phase II trial, the
ADC received accelerated approval in 2000 as a
single agent (dosing 9 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15)
for treating patients with acute myeloid leuke-
mia (AML) in first relapse, and who are at least
60 years old. The overall response rate (ORR)
was 26% in these patients, including a subset
having incomplete platelet recovery [23, 24],
while side effects included delayed hematopoi-
etic recovery and hepatic veno-occlusive disease
[24, 25]. Approval was conditioned on execu-
tion of randomized clinical trials to confirm

 patient benefit [24]. In 2010, the ADC was
withdrawn from the US market (although it is
still marketed in Japan), following an unsuc-
cessful confirmatory phase III trial which com-
pared the effect of adding a single dose of 6 mg/
m2 to standard remission induction therapy in
patients younger than 60 years [26]. Recently,
the results of several other randomized studies,
adding
gemtuzumab
ozogamicin
to
various
induction regimens, utilizing either a single
3 mg/m2 dose or fractionated dosing (3 mg/m2
on days 1, 4 and 7), to reduce the incidence of
hepatic veno-occlusive disease, have suggested
improved overall survival (OS) in AML patients
whose disease has favorable and intermediate
cytogenetic
characteristics
[27],
and
have
renewed interest in this ADC, and in CD33 as a
target [28].
The
second
ADC
to
receive
marketing
approval was brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris�),
made by conjugation of the potent auristatin
tubulin agent, MMAE, to an anti-CD30 anti-
body
via
a
cleavable
valine-citrulline
(vc)
dipeptide linker [6]. The CD30 antigen, a mar-
ker
for
activated
lymphocytes,
is
highly
expressed on the Reed–Sternberg cells of Hodg-
kin lymphoma (HL) as well as on the malignant
cells of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).
Early
phase
clinical
trials
of
the
‘‘naked’’
anti-CD30 antibody showed no responses in
HL, and, in ALCL patients, only 2 of 41 (5%)
had a complete response (CR) [29]. However,
arming the antibody with vcMMAE created a
highly active compound that received acceler-
ated approval from FDA in August, 2011, for
treatment of patients with relapsed HL or sys-
temic ALCL [6]. In the pivotal single arm phase
II trials, brentuximab vedotin showed a 75%
ORR in patients with relapsed or refractory HL,
with
a
median
duration
of
response
of
20.5 months [30], and an 86% ORR (57% CR) in
patients with systemic ALCL [31]. The principal
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was neutropenia,
while the main toxicity upon repeated admin-
istration was neuropathy [30, 31]. Several phase
III trials are in progress to confirm clinical
benefit of brentuximab vedotin in randomized
studies, both as a single agent and in combina-
tion
with
approved
agents
(http://www.
clinicaltrials.gov) [6].
A second ADC using the calicheamicin pay-
load, inotuzumab ozogamicin, which targets
the B cell antigen CD22 has completed a phase
III trial (INO-VATE ALL) in relapsed or refrac-
tory acute lymphoblastic leukemia [32–34]. The
results show that treatment with the ADC pro-
duced a higher rate of CR (80.7%) compared to
chemotherapy
(29.4%),
with
23%
of
the
patients alive at 2 years in the ADC-treatment
group compared to 10% in the chemotherapy
comparator
group
[34].
Like
gemtuzumab
ozogamicin, the most concerning non-hema-
tologic toxicities in patients treated with ino-
tuzumab ozogamicin were adverse events in
liver, especially veno-occlusive disease [34].
ADCS FOR TREATMENT OF SOLID
TUMORS: ADO-TRASTUZUMAB
EMTANSINE
The first ADC to receive marketing approval for
treatment
of
a
prevalent
solid
tumor
was
ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla�; T-DM1),
made by conjugation of the sulfhydryl group of
the maytansinoid DM1 to lysine amino groups
of the anti-human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) antibody, trastuzumab, via
reaction with the bifunctional non-cleavable
linker, succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cy-
clohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) [7, 35, 36].
Figure 1b shows a molecule of T-DM1 (repre-
sentative of a typical ADC), illustrating the
chemical structure of the linker–payload moiety
that is attached to lysine residues of the anti-
body (left panel), and a representation of a
molecular model of one antibody molecule
(molecular mass 150 kDa) conjugated to four
molecules of the maytansinoid DM1 (right
panel;
molecular
weight
of
linker-payload
*1 kDa). Since there are about 90 lysine amino
groups in trastuzumab, and the conjugation
reaction with SMCC is carefully controlled to
yield a conjugate with an average of 3.5 DM1
molecules per antibody molecule [7], the ADC
compound is heterogeneous with respect to
loading of the payload and its distribution
across the potential sites of reaction on the
antibody [37, 38]. Mass spectroscopy shows that
about 70–80% of the antibody molecules are
1018
Adv Ther (2017) 34:1015–1035
 conjugated to between 2 and 5 molecules of
DM1, while only about 3% of the antibody
remain
unconjugated
[37,
39,
40].
Peptide
mapping methodology shows that up to 70
individual lysine residues are partially modified
by linker–payload to an average level of about
4% with a range from 25% to \
1% [40]. While
the heterogeneity of an ADC presents a chal-
lenge for process and analytical development
and process control, the challenge can be met
by utilizing appropriate development strategies
and modern techniques of protein and chemi-
cal analysis [7, 37–40].
Phase I and phase II clinical trials in patients
with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer
(mBC) established a recommended phase II
dose/schedule of 3.6 mg/kg given by intra-
venous infusion once every 21 days [41–44].
The principal DLT was reversible thrombocy-
topenia
[41,
45],
with
reversible
low-grade
increases in hepatic transaminases also observed
[41]. Pharmacokinetics were non-linear in the
dose range 0.3–4.8 mg/kg as anticipated from
preclinical studies and prior clinical experience
with trastuzumab, given the normal
tissue
expression of HER2 [46]. The half-life was
approximately 4 days at the 3.6 mg/kg dose
level [47]. Plasma levels of free payload were
very low [41, 47]. An early signal of antitumor
activity (5 confirmed partial responses from 24
enrolled patients; ORR 20.8%) in the phase I
study was confirmed in two phase II trials in
patients (*110 patients each) who were heavily
pre-treated for their HER2-positive mBC, with
ORRs of 25.9% [43], and 34.5% [44].
These early clinical studies led to a pivotal
phase III trial (‘‘EMILIA’’) where patients with
mBC who had progressed following treatment
with a taxane plus trastuzumab were random-
ized to receive T-DM1 or the approved sec-
ond-line treatment of lapatinib (a tyrosine
kinase inhibitor which also targets HER2) plus
capecitabine [48]. The ORR (43.6% vs. 30.8%;
p\0.001), progression-free survival (PFS; 9.6 vs.
6.4 months; hazard ratio 0.65; p\0.001), and
OS (30.6 vs. 25.1 months; hazard ratio 0.68;
p\0.001), all significantly favored the T-DM1
arm versus the comparator arm of the study
[48]. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse
events of grade C3 was less in the T-DM1 arm
(40.8%,
with
thrombocytopenia
and
transaminitis most common, consistent with
the phase I/II experience) relative to the com-
parator arm (57.0%, with diarrhea, hand–foot
syndrome and vomiting most common). The
rate of cardiac adverse events, a concern with
HER2-targeted therapy, was low (
\
2%) in both
arms. The ‘‘EMILIA’’ trial established the safety
and effectiveness of T-DM1, and, in February,
2013, the FDA granted full approval as a therapy
for
treating
patients
with
HER2-positive
late-stage mBC previously treated with a taxane
and trastuzumab. To date, T-DM1 is the only
ADC to have received full approval from FDA
based on a randomized phase III study in any
indication.
A phase III trial (‘‘TH3RESA’’) in patients with
progressive HER2-positive advanced mBC who
had received at least two HER2-directed regi-
mens in the advanced setting, including tras-
tuzumab and lapatinib, and previous taxane
therapy in any setting, also favored T-DM1 over
the comparator arm (physician’s choice), with
improved PFS (6.2 vs. 3.3 months; hazard ratio
0.528; p\0.001) [49], and median OS of 22.7
versus 15.8 months for the comparator arm
(p = 0.0007) [50]. Of note, patients enrolled in
TH3RESA had had a median of 4 prior regimens
for
treating
their
advanced
disease,
with
28–30% of patients receiving [
5 such prior
treatments [49]. Again, improved efficacy was
achieved together with a reduced incidence of
grade C3 adverse events (32% for T-DM1 vs.
43% for the comparator) [49, 50].
A phase III trial of T-DM1 (with and without
pertuzumab) versus trastuzumab plus taxane in
the first-line treatment of HER2-positive mBC
(‘‘MARIANNE’’) showed that T-DM1 met the
pre-defined non-inferiority criteria, with similar
ORR (60–70%) and PFS (*14 months) for all
treatment arms [51]. Neither experimental arm
showed superior PFS to the trastuzumab plus
taxane arm, and addition of pertuzumab to
T-DM1 did not improve PFS despite preclinical
data that showed synergistic activity for this
combination [52]. The duration of response for
patients responding to treatment with T-DM1
was
*21 months,
while
that
of
patients
responding to treatment with trastuzumab plus
taxane was 12.5 months. T-DM1 was better
Adv Ther (2017) 34:1015–1035
1019
 tolerated, with patients having improved (pro-
longed) health-related quality of life [51].
The efficacy results of the MARIANNE trial
were disappointing in view of the initial pro-
mise of T-DM1 in early phase I and phase II
trials [53, 54]. However, the median PFS seen
with
T-DM1
treatment
in
MARIANNE
(14.1 months; n = 367 patients) was similar to
that observed in the prior small phase II trial
(14.2 months; n = 67 patients). A major differ-
ence between the phase II and phase III studies
is in the median PFS of the control trastuzumab
plus taxane arms, reported to be 9.2 months
(n = 70
patients)
and
13.7 months
(n = 365
patients), respectively [51, 53]. As noted by
Perez et al. [51], the latter value is consistent
with results of other phase III trials, for exam-
ple, the CLEOPATRA study of pertuzumab plus
trastuzumab plus docetaxel (PFS of comparator
arm = 12.4 months, n = 406 patients) [55]. In
the small phase II study [53], more patients in
the control arm were first diagnosed at an ear-
lier stage of disease and had received prior
(neo)adjuvant therapy with a taxane (40.0%)
versus the T-DM1 arm (32.8%), while in the
control arm of MARIANNE, 32.9% of patients
had
received
(neo)adjuvant
taxane
therapy
[51, 56]. One might speculate that more cases of
prior (neo)adjuvant therapy in the control arm
of the small phase II study [53, 56], might
account for its relatively poor PFS (9.2 months)
compared
with
larger
studies
(12.4
and
13.7 months in phase III studies cited above).
PATIENT SELECTION
IN THE TREATMENT OF SOLID
TUMORS WITH ADCS
What can we learn from the preclinical and
clinical development of T-DM1 with respect to
the relationship between target expression on
the cancer cells of a solid tumor, and clinical
benefit with the ADC? With the caveat that any
such learning may be unique to the biology of
the HER2 antigen in mBC, there are some
observations that may apply generally.
In a phase II trial, mBC patients (n = 112)
were enrolled on the basis of having had prior
treatment with trastuzumab, from which it was
inferred that they were HER2-positive [43].
However, the HER2 status of their disease was
retrospectively reassessed on archival primary
tumor specimens at a central laboratory (speci-
mens available in 95 cases). While the ORR for
the entire population was 25.9%, it was higher
(33.8%)
in
patients
confirmed
as
having
HER2-overexpressing mBC (n = 24), and only
4.8% in patients whose disease was reassessed as
HER2-normal
(n = 21).
There
were
similar
trends in a second phase II study in patients
(n = 110) who must have had at least two prior
HER2-directed regimens [44]; the ORR was
34.5% in the overall population, while in those
patients whose HER2 status was confirmed at a
central laboratory (in 80 of 95 available speci-
mens), the ORR was 41.3%. The implication of
these observations is that, if the phase I trial
(ORR 20.8%) had been conducted in all comers
with mBC, instead of with patients likely to
have HER2-overexpression, the ORR could well
have been zero because only about 20% of all
mBC patients overexpress HER2, while the
majority of cases express normal levels of HER2
(‘‘negative’’ in the jargon of the test). Thus,
patient selection, albeit indirect, may have been
a key factor in engendering enthusiasm for
continued development of the molecule.
Even within the HER2-positive population,
there is likely a range of HER2 expression levels
above the minimum level that saturates the
read-out of the approved immunohistochem-
istry test. In confirmed HER2-positive patients,
whose levels of HER2 mRNA were assessed by
quantitative
reverse
transcriptase/polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) methodology in a
phase II study, those with C median values had
an ORR of 36% with a median PFS not reached,
while those with \ median HER2 mRNA levels
had an ORR of 28% with a median PFS of
4.2 months [43]. While the numbers are small,
similar trends were observed in other phase II
trials [44, 54], including first-line treatment
settings [53, 56].
Collectively, these observations in clinical
studies with T-DM1 are consistent with a simple
hypothesis for driving success for ADCs in solid
tumors; that is, that the amount of payload
delivered to a cancer cell in a tumor is a func-
tion of how much ADC can be given to the
1020
Adv Ther (2017) 34:1015–1035
 patient (i.e., the dose and schedule, within
bounds dictated by tolerability), and how much
ADC the cell can receive (antigen density). The
higher the cell surface density of the target
antigen, the more ADC can be taken up and
metabolized by the cell, to release the active
cytotoxic agent. Furthermore, in the case of
HER2, it has been amply demonstrated pre-
clinically that the higher the antigen density on
a tumor xenograft, the greater the amount of
trastuzumab that is retained within the tumor
mass relative to a non-binding control antibody
[57]. Thus, for an ADC, personalization of
therapy can mean selecting only those patients
for treatment whose cancers express the target
antigen above a threshold level of antigen per
cell necessary for anti-tumor activity. However,
this criterion is by no means sufficient to pre-
dict anti-tumor activity, and further work needs
to be done to establish more biomarkers for
response to ADC therapeutics beyond simply
the presence of the target antigen, for example,
markers for sensitivity to the payload, or for
aspects of target biology that may affect inter-
nalization and intracellular trafficking (may
influence rate and extent of payload release
from the ADC) [19, 20, 36].
ADCS ADVANCING INTO PIVOTAL
TRIALS FOR TREATING SOLID
TUMORS
There are [
60 ADCs currently in clinical evalu-
ation, the majority of which (72%) utilize a
version of the two classes of potent tubu-
lin-binding
microtubule-disrupting
agents
found in the two currently approved ADCs
described above [5, 58, 59]. Most ADCs in
development are targeting solid tumors and are
in early clinical development, a testimony to
the relatively recent surge in enthusiasm for the
ADC
approach
following
the
approvals
of
brentuximab
vedotin
and
ado-trastuzumab
emtansine. Such enthusiasm must be tempered
by the discontinuation of development of sev-
eral compounds, mainly for reasons of insuffi-
cient activity at the maximum doses that can be
tolerated upon repeat administration [58, 59].
Some of the reasons for the relatively narrow
therapeutic window ascertained from the clini-
cal experience in developing ADCs have been
discussed elsewhere [58, 59]. However, several
ADCs have advanced into pivotal studies in
both solid tumor indications and in hemato-
logic cancers (listed in Table 1). The remainder
of this review will focus on the five ADCs cur-
rently
in
pivotal
studies
for
treating
solid
tumors.
Glembatumumab Vedotin
Glembatumumab
vedotin
(GV,
CDX-011,
CR011-vcMMAE) is an ADC comprising a fully
human IgG2 anti-glycoprotein nonmetastatic B
(gpNMB; osteoactivin) antibody conjugated with
vcMMAE (cleavable dipeptide linker). The target
membrane glycoprotein is expressed at higher
levels in certain cancers, including melanoma,
breast cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC),
glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, rela-
tive to normal tissues [61, 62]. The target is also
expressed on tumor stromal cells [62].
A phase I/II trial of GV in patients (n = 117)
with advanced melanoma established 1.88 mg/
kg administered once every 3 weeks as the rec-
ommended phase II dose [61]. At this dose and
schedule, there were 4 confirmed PRs (10%) in
patients assessed for efficacy (n = 40). Treat-
ment-related adverse events of grade C3 inclu-
ded
neutropenia
(19%)
and,
upon
repeat
dosing, neuropathy (7%) similar to observations
with other vcMMAE-containing ADCs [6, 63], as
well as with dolastatin 10 [64]. However, for GV,
the most common grade C3 adverse event was
rash (30%), and there was a high incidence of
alopecia (65%), and skin toxicity defined the
DLT in the dose-expansion phase of the study
[61].
Since
skin
toxicity
is
generally
not
observed for other vcMMAE-ADCs, such toxici-
ties
are
likely
target-directed
via
antibody
binding to gpNMB expressed in normal epithe-
lial tissue. Dose-dependent pharmacokinetics
was
observed
during
dose-escalation,
the

 comparing GV to investigator’s choice (IC) of
single agent chemotherapy (2:1 randomization)
in patients (n = 124) with refractory mBC (pa-
tients with a median of four prior lines of
cytotoxic therapy for advanced/metastatic dis-
ease) selected for the expression of target on at
least 5% of tumor epithelial cells or stromal cells
[62]. The toxicity findings in patients receiving
GV were similar to those described above in a
melanoma patient population, with rash, fati-
gue, nausea, neutropenia, alopecia and periph-
eral neuropathy being most common (
[
20% of
patients). The most common adverse event of
grade C3 was neutropenia (22%) in this patient
population. The confirmed ORR was 6% (5/83)
for GV versus 7% (3/41) for IC. Retrospective
analysis focusing on patients expressing gpNMB
on C25% of tumor epithelial cells showed a
confirmed ORR of 13% (3/23) for the GV arm
versus 9% (1/11) for IC, with a suggestion of
greater
activity
for
GV
in
patients
with
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) relative to
IC [62]. Although there was just one confirmed
partial response (PR) in the 10 patients with
TNBC (from 28 TNBC patients treated with GV)
that met the C25% cut-off for gpNMB expres-
sion, an additional 3 patients had responses at a
single time point [62]. GV is currently in a piv-
otal phase II trial ‘‘METRIC’’ (NCT01997333) in
patients with metastatic TNBC where C25% of
tumor cells express gpNMB by an immunohis-
tochemistry screen (expected to be *40% of all
TNBC patients), randomized 2:1 to receive
either GV or capecitabine [66].
Anetumab Ravtansine
Anetumab ravtansine (BAY 94-9343) consists of
a fully human anti-mesothelin antibody con-
jugated to the maytansinoid DM4 via a cleav-
able disulfide linker [67]. Mesothelin is highly
expressed in certain tumors, including 100% of
cases of mesothelioma, the majority of cases of
ovarian and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and a
high proportion of cases of non-small cell lung
cancer, gastric cancer and TNBC [see references
cited in 67]. Normal tissue expression is limited
to cells lining the pleura, pericardium and
peritoneum. The ADC was shown to have
strong activity in xenograft models of pancre-
atic and ovarian cancers, as well as in models of
mesothelioma, with the degree of activity gen-
erally correlating with the level of mesothelin
expression [67].
A phase I study in patients with ovarian
cancer
or
with
mesothelioma
established
6.5 mg/kg
given
intravenously
once
every
3 weeks as the recommended phase II dose. A
total
of
45
patients
were
treated
during
dose-escalation (0.15 to 7.5 mg/kg), and 32
patients were treated in an expansion cohort at
6.5 mg/kg [68]. A further 71 patients were trea-
ted with the ADC at 1.8 or 2.2 mg/kg in
expansion cohorts evaluating weekly dosing.
The DLTs at 7.5 mg/kg were peripheral neu-
ropathy and reversible corneal toxicity (kerati-
tis, blurred vision). At the 6.5 mg/kg dose
(n = 38 subjects), peripheral sensory neuropa-
thy (37%), and reversible corneal epitheliopa-
thy (50%) were mostly grade 1 or 2, with only a
low incidence of these toxicities at grades C3
(3% and 8%, respectively). Fatigue, nausea,
diarrhea, anorexia and vomiting, mostly grade 1
or
grade
2,
were
also
common
(37–63%).
Dose-proportional
pharmacokinetics
were
observed in the dose-ranging studies, suggesting
that target-mediated clearance by normal tissue
was negligible; the half-life of the ADC was
about 6 days [68], similar to that of other ADCs
with the same linker–payload design [69].
The ORR at the 6.5 mg/kg dose level was 18%
(7 responses in 38 subjects), with 2 PRs in
ovarian cancer patients (10%), and, notably, 5
PRs in patients with mesothelioma (31%), all of
which were in patients for whom anetumab
ravtansine was second-line treatment (n = 10;
ORR 50%) [70]. The responses in mesothelioma
were remarkably durable, with 4 of 5 responses
continuing for [
500 days [68]. Based on these
results, a randomized phase II pivotal trial was
initiated
in
December
2015,
investigating
6.5 mg/kg of anetumab ravtansine given every
3 weeks, in comparison to vinorelbine (2:1
randomization),
as
second-line
therapy
for
treating metastatic pleural mesothelioma [71].
In January 2017, this study completed enroll-
ment

Mirvetuximab Soravtansine
Mirvetuximab
soravtansine
(IMGN853)
is
a
folate
receptor
alpha
(FRa)-targeting
anti-
body–maytansinoid
conjugate
utilizing
a
charged, cleavable disulfide linker for conju-
gating DM4 to the humanized anti-FRa anti-
body [72]. FRa is expressed at high levels in the
majority of cases of epithelial ovarian cancer,
and
is
also
expressed
in
many
cases
of
endometrial cancer and lung adenocarcinoma
[72, and references therein]. Most normal tis-
sues do not express FRa (transport of folate into
cells
is
thought
to
be
mediated
by
other
folate-binding proteins such as reduced folate
carrier), making it a promising target for an
ADC approach [72]. All three ADC components,
the choice of antibody, linker and maytansi-
noid, were optimized in generating mirvetux-
imab soravtansine, and the final lead candidate
showed potent anti-cancer activity in several
xenograft
models
with
good
correlation
between the degree of activity and FRa expres-
sion levels [72].
A phase I dose-finding clinical study deter-
mined 6.0 mg/kg adjusted ideal body weight
(AIBW) given once every 3 weeks as the rec-
ommended phase II dose [73]. In the 44 patients
treated on an every 21 days schedule at doses
ranging from 0.15 to 7.0 mg/kg (total body
weight), the most common adverse events were
diarrhea, fatigue, vision blurred and nausea,
mostly grade 1 and 2, seen in 20–40% of sub-
jects. As with anetumab ravtansine, reversible
corneal
ocular
events,
vision
blurred
and
punctate keratitis, noted in 2 of 5 patients
treated at the 7.0 mg/kg dose level, defined the
DLT. Reversible corneal toxicity is a finding
commonly noted for ADCs having a disul-
fide-linked
DM4
(maytansinoid)
or
a
non-cleavable linker–MMAF (auristatin) as the
linker–payload moiety [68, 69, 73–76], and
reversible corneal adverse events were one of
the DLTs for another protein-bound micro-
tubule-disrupting
agent,
nanoparticle
albu-
min-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane�) [77].
Observations of anti-tumor activity during
dose-escalation led to investigation of mirve-
tuximab soravtansine at 6.0 mg/kg AIBW given
every 3 weeks in a cohort of patients (n = 46)
with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian can-
cer that was FRa-positive, defined as expression
with at least 2? intensity (scale 0–3?) on C25%
of tumor cells by an immunohistochemistry
assay [78]. There were no grade C3 ocular toxi-
cities noted, and the incidence and severity of
reversible grade 1 and 2 ocular events decreased
with the introduction of improved manage-
ment procedures including the use of preserva-
tive-free
lubricating
eye
drops
[78].
The
confirmed ORR was 26% (1 CR and 11 PRs) in
this heavily pretreated patient population (up
to five prior systemic treatment regimens).
Notably, the confirmed ORR was 44% in the
patients (n = 16) with 1–3 prior lines of therapy,
and whose FRa expression was at least 2? on
C50% of tumor cells [78], data that have defined
this as the patient population for a pivotal
phase III study ‘‘FORWARD I’’ (NCT02631876)
which
opened
in
December,
2016
[79].
Approximately 60% of epithelial ovarian cancer
patients meet the FRa inclusion criteria based
on this threshold [78, 80].
Depatuxizumab Mafodotin
Depatuxizumab
mafodotin
(ABT-414)
is
an
anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
antibody–auristatin
conjugate
wherein
the
charged auristatin MMAF is conjugated to the
antibody via an uncleavable linker [81]. The
ADC targets a domain on the activated form of
EGFR that is only present at high levels on
tumors whose growth is driven by overexpres-
sion of EGFR. Thus, the antibody binds well to
EGFR-overexpressing cancer cells with little or
no binding of the antibody to normal tissues, as
demonstrated in phase I clinical studies with
the ‘‘naked’’ antibody, ABT-806, showing that,
even dosing at 24 mg/kg, it lacks the skin toxi-
city characteristic of EGFR inhibition induced
by cetuximab [82]. Dose-proportional pharma-
cokinetics observed during dose-escalation also
suggested minimal target-mediated clearance by
normal tissue [82]. Binding of the antibody to
1026
Adv Ther (2017) 34:1015–1035
 the
overexpressed
receptor
on
tumor
cells
inhibits EGFR signaling, and conjugation to
MMAF does not interfere with this activity of
the ‘‘naked’’ antibody [81]. Thus, ABT-414 is an
ADC designed with a concept similar to that of
T-DM1 [7, 35], wherein the antibody itself has
anti-tumor activity which is augmented by
conjugation to a payload.
A phase I clinical trial in patients with
recurrent glioblastoma established 1.25 mg/kg
of ABT-414 given once every 2 weeks as the
maximum
tolerated
dose
(MTD),
both
as
monotherapy
and
in
combination
with
monthly
temozolomide
[83].
Evaluation
of
ABT-414
monotherapy
at
the
MTD
in
an
expanded cohort of 60 patients with EGFR-am-
plified glioblastoma (EGFR amplification occurs
in approximately 50% of glioblastoma cases) led
to a recommendation that the phase II dose be
reduced to 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks for further
development owing to a high incidence of
ocular (corneal) toxicities (92% all grades; 32%
grade C3) at the 1.25 mg/kg dose level [75]. The
ocular side effects were reversible in 4–6 weeks
to up to 6 months, depending on the severity of
the symptoms [75]. In 56 patients evaluated for
efficacy
using
the
Response
Assessment
in
Neuro-Oncology criteria, 3 (5.4%) achieved a
partial response, while 24 (43%) had stable dis-
ease [75]. The 6-month PFS estimate was 25.3%.
ABT-414 is now being evaluated in a random-
ized
placebo-controlled
phase
IIb/III
study
(NCT02573324), in combination with concur-
rent chemo-radiation and adjuvant temozolo-
mide
in
patients
with
newly
diagnosed
glioblastoma having EGFR amplification (‘‘In-
tellance1’’), which was initiated in September,
2015, as well as in a randomized trial in
EGFR-amplified
recurrent
glioblastoma
(NCT02343406).
Rovalpituzumab Tesirine
The newest ADC for a solid tumor indication
that has transitioned into a pivotal clinical
study, is rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), an
ADC comprising a humanized anti-delta-like
protein 3 (DLL3) antibody conjugated to a
pyrrolobenzodiazepine
(PBD)
dimer
via
a
protease-cleavable
valine-alanine
dipep-
tide-containing linker [84]. DLL3 is expressed
on the surface of certain tumor cells, including
SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine cancer, but
is absent from normal adult tissue. It is also
thought to be expressed on tumor progenitor
cells and cancer stem cells. The ADC induces
durable tumor regressions in a variety of xeno-
graft models of patient-derived tumors, its effi-
cacy correlating with DLL3 expression [84].
Rovalpituzumab tesirine was evaluated in a
phase I trial wherein a total of 74 SCLC patients
received doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.8 mg/kg
given once every 3 weeks or every 6 weeks [85].
Immunohistochemistry
assessment
of
DLL3
expression (biopsy samples available for 48/74
patients)
indicated
that
the
target
was
detectable on at least 1% of tumor cells in 88%
(42/48) of the cases, while 67% (32/48) showed
at least 50% of tumor cells staining positive. The
most common grade C3 toxicities (all patients)
were serosal effusions (11%), thrombocytopenia
(12%) and skin toxicities (8%), while lower
grades of these toxicities were also common (all
grades: 35, 20 and 49%, respectively). The rec-
ommended phase II dose was 0.3 mg/kg given
twice with a 6-week interval between dosing
[85]. Among 56 evaluable patients treated at
either 0.2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 0.4 mg/kg
every 6 weeks, there were 9 responses (16%) as
confirmed by independent central review. Eight
of these responses occurred in the 26 patients
whose DLL3 expression was detected on C50%
of tumor cells (the other case was a patient
whose DLL3 level could not be assessed) for a
31%
confirmed
ORR,
consistent
with
a
hypothesis that the level of expression of the
DLL3 target on tumor cells correlates with the
degree of anti-tumor activity for an ADC direc-
ted towards this target [85]. These data have led
to a single arm pivotal phase II clinical study of
rovalpituzumab tesirine in third-line and later
treatment of subjects with relapsed or refractory
DLL3-expressing SCLC (NCT02674568). Despite
the data suggesting that most/all responders
expressed the target antigen on C50% of tumor
cells, the inclusion criteria for this phase II trial
has a cut-off for DLL3 expression on tumor cells
of only [
1% (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

 THE PLACE OF ADCS
IN THE TREATMENT OF SOLID
TUMORS
The common theme that emerges from the
clinical experience obtained during develop-
ment of the one marketed ADC and the five
more now in pivotal clinical trials for the
treatment of solid tumors is the importance of
patient selection for the level of target expres-
sion on tumor cells. The development of T-DM1
was greatly aided by the fact that trastuzumab
itself was already a marketed therapeutic agent
for which there was already a marketed diag-
nostic test to define those breast cancer patients
(*20% of the total) whose cancer overexpressed
HER2 and who were thus most likely to benefit
from treatment with T-DM1 [7]. In the case of
the five ADCs in pivotal trials for mesothelioma,
FRa-overexpressing platinum-resistant ovarian
cancer, gpNMB-positive TNBC, EGFR-amplified
glioblastoma and DLL3-expressing SCLC, the
relationship between anti-tumor activity and
the level of target expression in the tumor
required investigation during clinical evalua-
tion of phase I and phase II trials. All five ADCs
utilize a diagnostic test (generally an immuno-
histochemistry test) in their respective pivotal
clinical trials in order to select the target-posi-
tive patient population most likely to benefit
from treatment with the ADC, by virtue of the
expression of the antibody target
above
a
pre-defined threshold level identified during
early clinical development.
ADCs that have shown promising activity in
solid tumors in early phase clinical trials, but
that have not yet advanced into pivotal trials,
also
show
most
benefit
in
patients
whose
tumors express the highest levels of target
antigen;
for
example,
lifatuzumab
vedotin
which targets NaPi2b [86], and SAR566658
which targets the CA6 antigen of mucin-1 [87].
It is likely that a prototype diagnostic test will
be a necessary accompaniment to virtually all
ADCs
in
development
for
targeting
solid
tumors. In the future, it may be that non-clin-
ical studies in patient-derived tumor xenograft
models will better identify the threshold levels
of target expression for favorable anti-tumor
activity, and accelerate the development of
appropriate calibration of a diagnostic test to
measure such antigen levels, prior to initiation
of clinical trials [88].
While the development pathway for three of
the five ADCs in pivotal studies for treating
solid tumors (Table 1) is to evaluate them as
monotherapy versus a chemotherapy compara-
tor arm—similar to the development of T-DM1
[48]—all three compounds are also being stud-
ied
in
combination
with
a
variety
of
chemotherapeutic
and
biologic
agents,
as
appropriate for the particular disease (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov). The relatively benign
side-effect profiles for many ADCs (relative to
cytotoxic chemotherapy) suggest that they may
be well suited to combine with other agents
with the goal of further improvement in treat-
ment outcomes for cancer patients, ultimately
in first-line treatment settings. For example,
mirvetuximab soravtansine is being evaluated
in combination with either carboplatin, pegy-
lated liposomal doxorubicin, or bevacizumab,
in
a
multi-arm
trial
called
FORWARD
II
(NCT02606305) [89].
In
contrast,
the
initial
strategy
for
the
development of ABT-414 is in combination
with chemo-radiation in the first-line treatment
of glioblastoma, a disease for which the current
standard of care has a poor outcome [90]. The
development strategy for rovalpituzumab tesir-
ine, on the other hand, is to seek an initial
accelerated approval based on response rate in a
single arm monotherapy trial in third-line or
later treatment for SCLC, a setting for which
there are no good treatment options available
[91].
The recent findings of Zippelius et al. [92–94]
suggest that ADCs, especially those made with
the potent microtubule-disrupting agents as the
payload,
may
be
combined
with
immune
checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD1 anti-
bodies
(pembrolizumab,
nivolumab)
or
anti-PD-L1
antibodies
(atezolizumab)
for
enhanced and sustained anti-tumor effect. Not
only do such ADCs induce immunogenic cell
death, but the ADC-mediated tumor accumu-
lation of a potent microtubule agent appears to
activate intra-tumor dendritic cells, inducing
uptake
of
antigens
and
the
migration
of
1028
Adv Ther (2017) 34:1015–1035
 antigen-loaded dendritic cells to lymph nodes
where they can trigger activation of T-cells
which may be directed towards tumor-associ-
ated antigens [92–95]. Pre-clinically,
Mu
¨ller
et al. have demonstrated that T-DM1 renders
HER2-positive breast cancer highly susceptible
to checkpoint blockade [94]. This research has
stimulated interest in clinical evaluation of this
potential, with ongoing clinical trials of T-DM1
in
combination
with
pembrolizumab
(anti-PD-1) and with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1)
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov), the recent addi-
tion of a combination of mirvetuximab sorav-
tansine with pembrolizumab as an arm of the
FORWARD II clinical study of this maytansi-
noid-ADC in combination regimens [89], and
with the addition of an anti-PD1-containing
arm to a combination trial of GV in treatment
of melanoma (NCT02302339).
CONCLUSIONS
In 2013, ado-tratuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)
became the first ADC approved for the treat-
ment of a prevalent solid tumor (HER2-positive
breast cancer). This success [7], after decades of
disappointment in developing immunoconju-
gates as therapeutic agents [96], has sparked a
flurry of research and development with over 80
ADCs being taken into clinical evaluation.
There are now 5 more ADCs in pivotal clinical
development for treating solid tumors (Table 1).
The level of target expression is a key parameter
in predicting the likelihood of patient benefit
for these ADCs, and the co-development of a
diagnostic test to assess the level of cell target
antigen is important for selecting the patient
population appropriate for receiving treatment.
There is clearly much yet to learn about the
optimal application of ADCs in the treatment of
cancers,
especially
in
establishing
the
best
combination modalities for treating different
cancers, including the role of the emerging
immune–oncology therapies. Nonetheless, the
opportunity
for
improved
cancer
therapy
incorporating ADCs into treatment paradigms
offer exciting possibilities for better outcomes
